Washington, May 16.—Revised fig
ures on the army re-organization bill
a* agreed upon by the house and sen
ate conferees and submitted to the
seriate by Chairman Chamberlain,
show that the new army will be even
larger than announced, when the
agreement was reached last Saturday.
Careful analysis shows that the max
imum strength in time of peace will
be 211,000 officers and men, including
2$,000 staff officers, Philippine scouts
and unasslgned recruits, and that the
War strength will be 236,E00 officers
and constant troops, with staff off!
cers, scouts, etc., added, will bring
tHe aggregate maximum strength of
the regular army to 261,500.
The' national guard, as reorganised,
rould

total 457,000, making a-total
if 710,600 available.

Historic Bow Street Court
Room Jammed at Early
Hour.
DEFENDANT APPEARS
ENTIRELY COMPOSED
Takes Voluminous Notes on
Testimony—^Witnesses
4 Describe Landing.
London, May 16.—For hours .this
morning crowds of people stood in
line around the Bow Street police
station waiting for the resumption of
the arraignment of Sir Roger Case
ment on charges of high treason in
connection with the Sinn Fein rebel
lion in Ireland. The little court room
was crowded within live minutes aft
er the doors were opened, and many
hundreds of men and women stood
outside waiting to hear the details of
the proceedings. Popular feeling and
Interest never has been so keen In any
trial at the historic Bow street.
Among the spectators at the trial
were Michael Flavin, Nationalist
member of the house of commons
whose home is at Tralee. and also a
number of friends of Casement, in
cluding several women.
Casement appeared to be entirely
at ease, and smiled cheerfully as he
took his place in the dock.
Daniel J. Bailey, who is accused
jointly with Casement, apparently
was more composed than yesterday.
Casement took voluminous notes as
witnesses were cross-examined.
Testimony In the first portion of
the day's session had to do with the
events in which the two prisoners are
charged with having played a part
after their landing at Tralee, where
as the evidence given yesterday dealt
almost entirely with the operations of
Casement and Bailey In Germany.
Witnesses told of the events of Good
Friday, when Casement landed at Tra
lee.
The ot the HebeUion.
The attorney general in his address
yesterday introduced- a striking fea
ture, when hp paused lnNbls speech to
produce in court the flag which it is
asserted Casement and hls oompan
ions brought from Germany to Ire
land. This was the emblem of revolt
green (Um: with a yellow castle
upon it', and under the oastle ,..the
motto: -.
"Urbs Antlqua Fuit Studilsque As
perima Belli."
Casement's attorneys made little at
tempt at cross-examination, btft sev
eral times questioned the witnesses as
to why Casement wished them to join
the Irish brigade. The point of the
questions seemed to be to show that
the freedom of Ireland was the only
thing involved and that the brigade
was not to attempt to assist Germany.
Court Martial for MacNelll.
Dublin, May 16.—A court martial
soon will be oalled to try John Mac
Neill, president of the Sinn Fein vol
unteers, and professor of law in the
National university.
It Is announced that they will ,be
allowed to be represented by counsel.
Professor MacNetll, on the Satur
day before the outbreak of the revolt
In Dublin, sent out a notice postpon
ing indefinitely the parade of volun
teers arranged for Easter Sunday. He
disappeared on the day of the open
ing of'the disturbances, but later was
arrested. His arrest was declared to
be considered one of the most impor
tant made by the British authorities
In connection with the uprising.
Professor MacNelll was the organ
iser «nd vice president of the Gaelic
league, In addition to being president
of the Sinn Fein volunteers.
During the fighting In Dublin he
was reported to have been wounded.
John Dillon, In his recent notable
speech in the house of commons, said
that but for the action of John Mac
Neill. "who broke the back of the re
bellion, the military would have been
fighting still."

Congressman and Others
Charged with Conspiracy
to Get Early Trials.
New Yorit, May 16.—Congressman
Frank Buohanan and others, charged
with conspiring to violate the Sher
man- anti-trust law by Inciting strikes
among. munitions workers in this
country, are to be given an early trial
in the federal court, it was asserted
here by a responsible^government of
ficial after a conference in the offices
of United States- District Attorney H.
Snowden Marshall.
The announcement is the result, it
is understood, of daily conferences
between Mr. Marshall and Assistant
United States District Attorney Ray
mond H. Sarfaty, who presented the
evidence to the grand jury, and the
special government counsel who are
to try the case, Judge I. B. Oeland
of this city and John Lord O'Brien,
former United States district attorney
at Buffalo.
When Congressman Buchanan -pre
ferred charges against Mr. Mrashall
some time ago, it was announoed that
the trial would go over to the fall
term. The-dielsion today came as a
surprise. The government is deter
mined that there shall be no further
delays In. the case. It was stated, and
with this end in view It Is,prepared
to hand ffidftrn superseding Indictments
in the event- that the existing ones
are quashed on the motion of the two
defendants,' Submitted last week.
Ijast week it was declared that
Congressman Buchanan was to fits
similar motions through his chief
oounsel, former Senator Joseph W.
Bailey of Texas. It was learned- today,
howevsr, by the government that the
former senator has abandoned this
ihtsntibn.
The. government, it was declared, is
eager to bring the oase to -trial In
view of the faet that new and alleg
edly startling evidence has been un
covered.
A rumor.that^ David. Lamar, known
as :."the wolf of Wall street," one of
the defendants, may. become a gov
ernment witness In return for clem
ency, was neither affirmed nor denled
by federal officials. It: was expected,
however, that Lamar might make ov
ertures when hs realised he cannot
evade serving the twoiyear sentence
given, him for Impersonating a con
gressman.
Lamar's appeal to ths United Mates
supreme court was raeenUy denied
and the mandate ordering him com
mitted- to Atlanta. Is, expected to be

Russian and German Red
Cross Have Rupture over
Sinking of Portugal.
Stockholm, via London, May 16.—
According to the Dagena Nyheter, tbe
International Red Cross conference
resulted In a complete rupture be
tween the German and Russian Red
Cross owing to the refusal of Ger
many to express regret for the sink
ing of the Russian hospital ship Por
tugal.
Turkey admitted last month that a
Turkish submarine had sunk the Por
tugal in the Black sea. The vessel,
according to the report, was steering
toward a landing plaoe heavily laden
and towing several loaded punts in
which there were numerous persons.
The commander and other officers of
the submarine, tbe statement added,
"were justified In believing the ship
was a transport which was on the way
to land troops and supplies."
A dispatch from London April 22
said Prince Charles of Sweden had
telegraphed the Russian Red Cross
that regret had been expressed by
the Red Cross of both Austria and
Germany over the sinking of the Por
tugal. The Russian Red Cross pre
viously had decided -to sever direct
relations with the Austrian and Ger
man Red Cross in the absence of pro
tests from Germany concerning the
Portugal, the dispatch added, and
representatives of the Russian Red
Cross had sent a telegram to Prince
Charles announcing the provisional
cancellation of the mandates of the
Russian delegates to the approaching
meeting of the international Red
Cross at Stockholm and asking the
prince to act as intermediary in as
certaining the views of. Germany and
Austria regarding the Portugal Inci
dent.

Border Forcesis Begun.
CARRANZA AGREES.
Washington, May 16—General Carranza has agreed
to Major General Scott's inforSnal understanding with
General Obregon, which provides that the Carranza forces
shall endeavor to show their ability to control the situation
in northern Mexico, while American troops remain for the
time being.
Washington, May 16.—The net result of the rafRtary
conferences at El Paso, as reported by General Scott to
Secretary Baker, has been to convince the Carranza gov
ernment that the United States has no other purpose In
its operations in northern Mexico than to stamp out brig
andage, and as a consequence there exists a substantially
unwritten understanding that the Carranza forces shall
endeavor to demonstrate their ability to handle the situa
tion as a necessary first step toward the withdrawal pf the
American punitive expedition.
Scott believes General Obregon is acting in good faith
and that the border situation is less critical today, so far
as the American government it concerned. To carry out
his share of the plans, Obregon has agreed to occupy and
police the Parral district, scouring the mountainous re-:
gions to the west of the town in search of the remnants
of Villa's followers.,,,. He.-al§p plans on establishing- a
country to prevent incurfions streh as that at Gl«n^^rfn^s

LARGE ItmOE IS DISPATCHED.
Washington, May 16.—For that purpose, Obregon hu mdiwil In
to those regions ten thousand troops under General Trwvino, add to bo
the most efficient field commander In the Carranza army.
Another Important element, one which the American army offi
cers regarded as the most vital to General Pershing's line of communi
cation. was cleared up by Obregon's agreement not to bring a
force of Carranca troops to Sonora through Pulpit Pass Into 1
rear. While the war department Is satisfied of Pershing's equipment to
care for his force in any circumstances, the possibility of a large Car
ranza force being moved to his rear was regarded with some concern.
On their side Generals Scott and Fnnston assured Obreg°n that
precautions will be taken by American commanders not to dispose
their forces so as to embarrass the operation of Mexican troops and
also that the border patrol on the American side would be-stxengtheoed.
