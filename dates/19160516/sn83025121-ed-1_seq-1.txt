Sir Roger Casement, who went on n
filibustering expedition from Germany
to Ireland to lead the rebellion there,
and who- was captured and brought to
London, faced the bar of the famous
old Bow Street police court yesterday
in the beginning of what promises to be
a sensational ease.
Hlgb Treason May Bo Charge
The preliminary examination is for
the purpose of determining whether
Casement shall stand trial on a charge
of high trt-aaon.
IJ&niel Bailey, a soldier, was arrested
Sunday on a charge similar to that in
which Casement is held. Not for years
has there been such keen interest li
played in n court case in London. The
room and corridors were crowded with
a tenHely-ubsorbod audience .
It is reMrted that Hir Roger has mad
a statement to the authorities outlining
his position, mid it (s believed that thin
will render unnecessary much taking of
evidence h ml thus shorten the hearing.
In opening, rlir Frederick Smith, at-torney-generul,
said that Hir Roger had
described himself as organiser of the
Irish volunteers, and has impressed up
on Irish prisoners in Germany that
everything could be gained for Ireland
by Germany winning the conflict.

The United States has made previous

LONDON, May Id. Although the
, official statements describe) the

deal of activity shown on the western
front and in the Caucasus, while the
Italians are reMrted to have anade
gains in their fighting on the Trentino
front.
By a surprise attack against the Ger

of trenches, driving them' bach; with
heavy slaughter. Berlin report that
the French counter-attacks against
German positions north of La lionue
Mort, failed; to 'produce any results,

Heavy fighting is also reported east
of the Meuse, between Douaumont and
Vaux, in the region of the Caillett
woods, where for weeks the Germans
have been attempting to drive one of
their famous double salients into the
French line, hoping thereby to
"squeere" out the French troopn
holding Douaumont positions. The
positions here are important and the
French are said to have tried counter
attacking in order to reguin the ex
treme northern and eastern tip of the
woods, where the Crown Prince has ef-tii-ted
a lodgement. Ho far these
counter-attacks have proved in vain.
