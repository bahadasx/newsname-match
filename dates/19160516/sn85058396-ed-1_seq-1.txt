H ; Professing no religious creed, yet

9 f greater tribute was ever paid to the
memory" of a man of affairs In Utah
H n ; than was accorded to that.of the late
I "William Glasmann, in the assemblage
I :. at his funeral service yesterday after-
noon. The sen-ice was held in the
Ogden Mormon tabernacle, was con
I i ducted by a Presbyterian minister,
I ;, and was attended by people of many
' religious beliefs and fraternal affili-
:; ations. the gathering completely fill
( ing the large auditorium. Members
$ of the Weber club, Order of the East-
u em Stir and the Knights of Pythias
Lj f attended in a body and members of
'i the Masonic order, city officials and
' prominent men of affairs from differ
ent parts of the state ware In the as
; i semblage.
, This gathering, too was a striking
;J J: examplo of the spirit of religious tol-
; erance and unity of purpose now exlst-
2: ont among the people of Utah, which
, gives the state Its strength and for
; which, the speakers infei-red yestei-
fj day, the late editor of the Ogden
t Standard, by word of mouth and in
(he columns of his newspaper was, in
I a big measure, responsible.
j More impressive probably than the
' mark of respect shown by the pres-
. ence of the large crowd, was the evi
jg dence that the deceased had won the
I deep friendship and love of many,
shown by floral tributes that covered
the front of the wide pulpit platform,,
at the Tabernacle and the greater por
, I tion of the burial plot at the cemetery.
; To these were added the words of
speakers, men who had known and
j appreciated the departed civic and
'' political leader for his trails of char
acter worthy of exemplification.
Many Visit the Home.
From the earlj' hour yesterday
. morning, when the home at 724 Twenty-fourth
street was opened, until a
I short time before the hour of the
;, funeral, friends of Mr. Glasmann and
has berenved famllv In larce numbers
! viewed the body and placed their flor-
al tributes near his bier. At 1:30 o'
clock, the flowers were removed from
. the room and taken to the Tabernacle,
1 V and at 1:50 o'clock, after the members
of the family had viewed the body of
their loved one for the last time, if

The automobile cortege was. then
formed, under the direction of Chief
of Police Thos. E. Browning and Un
; dertaker P. F. Kirkendall, and, escort
) ed by a platoon of police, the city fire
' department, the city commissioners
and heads of departments, moved west
on Twenty-fourth street to Washlng
i ton avenue and to the Tabernacle. As
it passed along the main street of the
city, the impression that, In the death
of the ex-mayor, the community had
lost a man in whose career it had
I "been greatly Interested, was manifest
ed by large gatherings of people on
the sidewalks, and watched the silent
procession of automobiles.
Reaching Twenty-second street, the
platoon of police parted ranks and,
I joining the members of the Weber
club and Knights of Pythias lodge,
several hundred of whom were al
ready In position, formed a lane and
tstood with, heads bared as the funeral
i cortege passed through to the north
.v- entrance of the Tabornacle. More
f) than 30 minutes before the hour set
- for the funeral service, the Taber
1 nacle, with the exception of the space
j reserved for the family, the Standard

Death lays the silence of his sword
Whose,, heart to quicker measures
moved
When Duty spake th' inspiring word
He Tell asleep beside the path
That stretched in weariness away,
And in the shadow of the rock
Contented rests from tiresome day.
Governor Present.
Just before the services were open- ,
ed with the reading of quotations ;
from the bible, concerning the resur
rection, a party of prominent men of
the state, including Governor William .
spry, George T. Odell, president ot
the Consolidated Wagon and Machine
Company, Fred W. Price of the Car
diff Mining company, and Judge John
F. Chidester, arrived at the Taber
nacle and remained throughout the
service.
Rev. Carver followed his reading of
the ritual quotations with prayer, and
the song, "Rock of Ages," was sung
with much expression by a quartet
composed of Douglass Brian, Jed Bal
lantyne, Leo Madsen and Walter
Stephens, of the Ogden Tabernacle
choir.
Apostle D. O. McKay's Address.
Apostle David O. McKay, who was
to have been the first speaker, was un
able to give utterance to his thoughts,
due to the effect of injuries received
in an accident about two months ago
and his eulogy on the life of Mr. Glas
mann was read-byJT.VEarl'Pardoe'It
was as follows:
"My Dear Friends: Some experl
ences in this life come to us so sud
denly that for the time we cannot
comprehend them. They are like a
sudden blow to the body which in
jures but at the same time produces
an insensibility that deadens the
pain; or like the sudden extinguish
ing of a light the brighter its rays ,
and the moro suddenly it is extln-i
guished, the denser seems the dark-
ness that follows. Death always
lirinca Qfirrnn- anr1 nfton nrrvliirnc n
shock. It is true that,
" 'Come he slow, or come he fast.
It is but death that comes at
last.' "
"Yet when he comes and Intercepts
a swift career, just as it has within
its grasp the realization of a life's
work, he strikes a blow which stag
gers us, and which requires some
time for us to realize fully what has
happened.
"Such was the effect upon his
friends in Ogden, and upon the state
In general, of the announcement last
Friday night, of the sudden summons
that came to William Glasmann. I
had believed him to be In the full
vigor of health and manhood; and
so he seemed when I last met him
but a few days ago. His sudden
death, therefore, came as a shock
that made the mind almost reject
the fact as impossible. On at least
three occasions within a compara
tively short time has the community
suffered from death's instantaneous
blows. Thus was David Eccles strick
en; and the gloom of Dr. Osgood's
tragedy was still hanging like a pall
over the city when the hand of death
silenced the heartbeats of our friend
and fellow citizen, William Glasmann.
Truly life seems
" 'But the immediate breath we
draw:
Nor have wo surety for a sec
ond gale.
A frail and fickle tenement It is;
Which, like the brittle glass
which measures time,
Is broke ere half Its Bands are
run.' "
"Three times elected to the highest
honor this city could bestow upon
him; once a member of the Utah
state legislature and speaker of the
house; for years editor of the lead
ing newspaper in the city, which has
been a mighty factor In moulding the
sentiments of this community; active
in business enterprizes, and a power
in political circles, William Glasmann
has become known to thousands in
the city and the state. Some of us
have disagreed with him In his poli
cies; but we always found him a vig
orous defender of the cause he
espoused.
"It It be true that
" 'Wise men ne'er sit and wall
their loss,
But cheerly seek how to re
dress their harms,'
then our departed brother was in
deed a wise man. Defeat could never
daunt him, nor victory puff him with
pride. Always amidst success and re
verses, he was the same pleasant,
persistent, persevering 'Bill,' as he
was known affectionately by his
friends, and Indifferently by his op
ponents. In the death of William
Glasmann, Ogden and Weber county
have lost one of the moBt potent fac
tors in their political and economic
life. He was always a true friend I
I to Ogden; and ever an enemy to the
traducers of the people of this state.
During campaigns when a majority
of the people of Utah were maligned
and everywhere spoken ovll of when
It was not by any means a popular
thing to do to come to advocate their
cause, William Glasmann as editor
and as citizen was always found deal
ing sledge-hammer blows In their de
fense. I am glad, now, that I took
the opportunity of expressing to him,
on more than one occasion, my ap
preciation of his fearlessness in de
fending what was then a very unpop
ular cauBe.
"Last Friday afternoon, feeling a
little unwell, he entered his study,
and lay down on the couch to rest.
In a few moments he was gone.
"As William H. Thompson once
wrote of the sudden death of William
Windom, secretary of the treasury of
the United" States, we might ask,
what was it that then happened to
William Glasmann, the man who for
years has occupied such prominent
and honorable positions among his
feulows, and who In the vigor of man
hood was about to receive one of the
highest offices his political party
could give? Human philosophy and
human science hardly know what to
say In reply. A higher voice than
either of theirs answers: 'He fell
asleep! And after sleep cometh the
awakening!'
"To the Saviour of mankind the
change we call death was only a
sleep. Of one of his dear friends
whose lips had been silenced and
whose body lay cold and lifeless, he
said, "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth;
but I go, that I may awake him out
of sleep." So He spake of Jairus'
little daughter; and so He looked up
on the only son of the widow of Nain,
already wrapped in his burial clothes
and lying in his casket.
"This is the source from which the
bereaved loved ones mu3t-obtain com
fort: Death is not the ond of exist
ence any more than birth was Its be
ginning. "'There is no Death! What seems
so is transition;
This life of mortal breath
Is but the suburb of the life
elysian.
Whose portal we call Death.'
"Even this transition, Sir Oliver
Lodge tells us 'May thus be an awak
ening rather than a sleeping; it may
be that we, stillJnvolvcd, in mortal
coil,' are in the more uveam-lfke and
unreal condition.'
"May our kind and merciful Fa
ther, who has promised to Comfort
the widow and bless the fatherless,
bestow through His Holy Spirit, upon
the bereaved wife and children and '.
other sorrowing loved on&s, the peace
and resignation their souls require;
and here on this solemn occasion '
i may each one resolve, in the words
'of the poet:
I " 'To so live that when thy sum
mons comes to join the immovable
t-I-1. A ,1.- 1- I
caravan, wiucn moves io inat myste
rious realm where each shall take
his chamber in the silent halls of
death, thou go, not like the quarry
slave at night scourged to his dun
geon, but sustained and soothed by
an unfaltering trust, approach thy
grave like one that wraps the drapery
of his couch about him and lies down
to pleasant dreams.' "

The sermon of the afternoon, deliv
ered by Rev. Carver, followed the

YOUTHFUL NEGRO
BURNED AT STAKE
Waco, Tex., May 15. With fifteen
thousand persons as witnesses, includ
ing women and children, Jesse Wash
ington, negro boy, who confessed to
be criminal assault and murder of Mrs.
Lucy Fryar, seven miles south of here
last Monday, was taken from the
Fifth district courtroom today and
burned on the public square.
The burning came immediately aft
er the negro's trial had ended and aft
er the jury had returned a verdict of
guilty, giving him the death penalty.
Someone not far from the negro
started the cry of "Get the negro," and
Washington was seized.
A suggestion that he burned on
the plaza met with instant response
and he was dragged to the city hall
yard, where the chain already around
his neck was thrown over the limb of
a tree, wood secured and the fire start
ed. After the verdict had been returned
the negro said, in a whisper, "I'm
sorry I did it." The rush came with
such suddenness that officers and
lawyers were swept off their feet
About 1 o'clock members of the mob
returned, put the charred, body in a
sack and a man on horseback dragged
It through the principal streets.
What remained of the body was
dragged behind an automobile to Rob
inson in a sack and suspended from a
telephone pole at that place.
EXPRESS DRIVERS
ORDER STRIKE
Chicago, May 16. Five hundred
wagon drivers of seven express com
panies struck today because the com
panies had discharged drivers who
joined the union.
Police were detailed to guard the
barns and headquarters of the company.
OBREGON PLANS
TO KEEP WORD
Agrees to Occupy and Police
Parfal District and to Estab
lish Strong Patrol Along
Border Near Big Bend.
Washington, May 16. The net re
sult of the military conferences at
El Paso as reported today by Major
General Scott to Secretary Baker, has
been to convince the Carranza gov
ernment that the United States has
no other purpose In Its operations in
Northern -Mexico than to stamp out
brigandage and as a consequence
there exlslts substantially an unwrit
ten understanding that the Carranza
forces shall endeavor to demonstrate
their ability to handle the situation
as the necessary first step toward
withdrawal of the American punitive
expedition.
General Scott believes General Ob
regon is acting in good faith and
that the horder situation is less criti
cal today.
Obregon Makes Agreement.
To carry out his share of the plans
General Obregon has agreed to occu
py and police the Parral district,
scouring the mountainous regions
west of that town in search of the
remnants of Villa's followers. He also
agreed to establish a strong patrol
lme along the Mexican side of the
Big Bend country to prevent incur
sions such as that at Glen Springs,
For that purpose General Obregon has
ordered into those regions ten thou
sand troops under General Trevino,
said to be the most efficient field
commander in the Carranza army. Ad
vices to the war and state department
indicate that the movements are be
ing carried out promptly.
Another important element, and
one which American army officers
regarded as most vital to General
Pershing's line of communications
was cleared up by General Obregon's
agreement not to bring the large force
of Carranza troops In Sonora through
Pulpit Pass into General Pershing's
rear While the war department is
satisfied of General Pershing's equip
ment to care for his force in any
circumstances, the possibIlit3- of a
large Carranza force being moved to
his rear, was regarded with some
Assure Obregon.
On their side, General Scott and
General Funston assured General
Obregon that precautions would be
taken- by American commanders not
io dispose their fSrces so as to em
'barrass the operation of the Mexican
troops, and als that the border patrol
on the American side would be
strengthened.
As to Villa himself, neither Ameri
can nor Mexican officials seem to
have any knowledge of his present
whereabouts, or anything positive to
show that he is still alive. General
Obregon believes him dead.
f,Th? first obstace encountered by
the American conferees at El Paso
was the necessity of convincing Gon-
.t, -o" "'a,, me u..peuiuon alter
illa was not an intervention step,
the size and composition of the force
aroused alarm among Mexican offici
als, and it was pointed out to General
bcott that It was not customarv for
P0utesr, !,n Pursu,t of one man to go
with field guns and mountain artil
lery. The American officers finally
succeeded in persuading the war min
ister, however, that the United States
government had no intention other
j than its announced purpose.
A new plan for patrolling the bor
der has been recommended by Gen
eral Funston. Ho proposed a corps
of forty-eight motorcycles, thirty tan
dem and eighteen single machines.
Secretary Baker said todav he would
probably approve the plan. General
Funston will make El Paso the base
of operations for the motorcycle
scouts. Use of motorcycles would en
able patrols to cover territory more
quickly and also enable officers to
receivo reports moro expeditiously.
Julio Acosta Killed.
General Pershing reported that Julio
Acosta. one of Villa's aides, was kill
ed during the engagement at OJo
The gunlroat Marietta returned yes
terday to Tamplco from Tuxpam. Her
commander advised the navy depart
ment conditions there were quiet.
Secretary Baker laid before Presi
dent Wilson and the cabinet the in
formation brought by Major General
Scott. After the cabinet meeting it
was reiterated that no armed inter
ventioniwas in prospect and that the
situation apparently was improving.
Information laid before the cabi
net was to the effect that the Carran
za government was making headway
in controllng the country and In es
tablishing civil government and was
becoming stronger.
Arizona congressmen today receiv
ed appeals from Tucson asking pro
tection for Inhabitants along-the bor
der from- NogaleB to Yuma who are
declared entirely defenseless.
American Prisoners Released.
Washington, May 16. The state
department today -was advised of the
release of four seamen, three Ameri
cans and one Chilean imprisoned at
Acapulco, Mex., on the charge of be
ing Implicated in the blowing up of a
steamship. The men left for San
Francisco aboard the steamship May
fair. Twenty Americans have left Mazat
lan on the steamship San Juan. Ma
zatlan is reported quiet.
Bandits Derail Express.
El Paso, Texas., May 16. Bandits,
thought to be Mexicans from across
the Rio Grande, this morning removed
the spikes from three rails on the
Southern Pacific causing the derail
ment of the-eastbound Sunset Express.
The wreck occurred near Fort Han

Pershing Disperses Bandits.
Columbus, N. M., May 1G. Effort!1
of the American column to extermi
nate the scattered bands of Vllllstas
in the district occupied by General J.
J. Pershing's command are rapidly
nearing a culmination, according to
beliefs expressed here today. The
largest bands have been broken and
driven south, but a few fugitives re
main in the territory just south of the
field base at Namlqulpa. This was
evidenced by the attack made by
them upon twelve American troopers
on a foraging expedition recently. Un
official reports here indicated that
flying columns ot cavalry are now rid
ing hard In an attempt to exterminate
those who, as long as they are at
large, remain an annoyance to the
Amerlcau lines of communication.
Private adyices here today indicate
that preparations -are being made at
Colonia Dublan, 120 miles, jEOuth of
the border, to concentrate great quan
tities of supplies and troops. Noth
ing could be learned in this connection
at military headquarters, however.
With the interruption to the regular
army truck service between Columbus
and the fiefd, many tons of soldiers'
mail has collected in the army post
office here. Adding to the congestion
is much matter which has been in
sufficiently addressed, no mail not
bearing the addressees regiment being
forwarded.

with the Sinn Fein rebellion.
The little courtroom was crowded
within five minutes after the doors
were opened and many hundreds of
men and women were unable to obtain
admission. Superintendent Quinn of
Scotland Yard, who is in charge of
the police arrangements, voiced the

factor but the case in itself has feat
ures which raise it far above the level
of any criminal hearing in my mem
ory." Casement Entirely at Ease.
Among the spectators were Michael
Flavin, Nationalist member of the
house of commons whose home is at
Tralee and a number of friends of
Casement, including several women.
Casement appeared to be entirely at
ease as he took his place In the dock.
Daniel J. Bailey who is accused joint
ly with Casement appeared more com
posed than he was yesterday.
The testimony In the early part of
today's session had to do with events
in which two prisoners are charged
with having played a part after their
landing at Tralee.
Farmer Tells Story.
John McCarthy, a farmer of Curra
hane, county Kerr, told of findiug the
collapsible boat In which Casement,
Bailey and a man named Monteith,
who is still at large, landed at Tralee.
McCarthy said ho pulled It ashore and
found a dagger and a tin box. On his
way homo he met his children, who
were playing with three revolvers they
had found near the shore.
Other witnesses from the same dis
trict told of having seen signal lights
nt sea on the evening before Good
I Touch of Humor.
A touch of humor was added when
Mary Gorman told her story of meet
,f lug Casement and his two companions
as they were leaving the beach. She
talked In a brogue so broad that It
was necessary to ask her to write the
words before they could bo under
stood. This she did smilingly. After
Identifying Casement she told how
a she had seen him later in the day n
the custody of a constable. She did
r not recognize Bailey.
-U this point the attorney general,
Sir Frederick Smith, took a hand in
the proceedings. Ho conducted the
examination of Sergeant John Hearne
of the Royal Irish Constabulary who
was summoned by McCarthy when he
found the boat. It was Sergeant
3 Hearne who arrested Casement near
Tralee.
Sergeant Hearne Testifies,
i The sergeant said that, accompan
t led by Sergeant Riley, he searchedthe
country round and at length found in
I the old fort "a man the prisoner in
; the dock the tall man, Casement."
'. The sergeant continued.
"I asked him who he was. He said
