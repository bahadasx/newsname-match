AUSTRlAftS REVOLT
.ItlUlll
PKi:i CAMP
Refuse to Work and Attack Their
Guards
ONE KILLED, SEVERAL WOUNDED
Rifles and Bayonets Freely Used to
Quell Outbreak at Kapuskasing,
Ontario.
Cochran, Ont., May 16. An out
break among Austrian prisoners of
war in the internment camps at Kap
uskasing, Ont., last Friday was quelled
by the military authorities after one
of the prisoners had been killed, nine
seriously wounded, several fatally, and
four slightly injured, it was learned
here last night.
The revolt is said to have been
started by about 300 Austrian prison
ers who were removed from the camp I
at I'nearium, where they had refused
to work and had turned on their
guards. They were taken Wednesday
under heavy guard to the Kapuskasing
camps, about GO miles west of Cochran
on the Transcontinental railway.
The new arrivals continued to mani
fest a spirit of insubordination at
Kapuskasing. The smoldering unrest
culminated Firday in a riot, and the
guards fired on the prisoners. Rifles
and bayonets were used freely, it is
said, and the outbreak, in which other
prisoners artlclpatcd, was not quelled
for several hours. There were no
casualties among the soldiers.
Major-Cen Sir Sam Tughes, min
ister of militia, last night sent Gen.
Logie, commanding the Toronto mili
tary district, to Kapuskasing to take
charge of the situation and report to
him. The camps were reported to be
quiet last night.
NEW MANUFACTURING COMPANY
The Badger-Halliwell Company Have
Rented Part of Olin Scott Plant
The Badger-Halliwell company.
owned by two Rrldgeporters, have rent
ed a portion of the Olln Scott plant
and by the first of June expect to have
from a dozen to 18 men employed in
the manufacture of taps, dies and ma
chine tools.
The partners have a shop engaged
in this sort of production In Hridgeport
and in getting their Bennington shop
running smoothly, may dismantle the
former. They have rented the down
stairs room in the other half of the
building now utilized by Maj. H. D.
Fillmore as an office, also the entire
floor overhead and part of the foundry.
The Olin Scott estate will probably
handle of such casting business as
they may have.
The new business Is a modest affair,
yet bids fair to bring several new fam
ilies Into town. Machinery will be in
stalled during the coming fortnight.

COOOTICOI
. Ill BELFAST
Conference With Representative
Ulster Men DisaoDOinting
SUSPICIOUS OF HOME RULE
Newspapers Advise Caution in Regard
to Any Promises Premier May
Make.
Belfast, May 15. Stubborn disin
clination to accept anything in , the
way of a Government which ' might
imply the future subjection of Ulster
to home rule was evident today on the
occasion of Premier Asquith's visit to
Belfast, which lasted only a few hours.
So fur as can be Jearned, the Premier's
conference with a large body of repre
sentative Ulster men was disappoint
ing. I '
It is understood that the question of
the general disarmament of forces in
Ireland not authorized by the Govern
ment was discussed, and, although
those present were pledged to secrecy,
it is rumored that cold water had been
thrown on the proposal. The discus
sion was very full and frank, but It is
asserted that the result was unsatis
factory.
A telegram from Sir Edward Carson
to the Ulster Unionist Council did not
bring about an alleviation of the situa
tion. Sir Edward wired:
"I know nothing whatever as to the
rumors as to the Government of Ire
land appearing in the press nor as to
the foundation for them."
Belfast itself docs not show any
signs of accepting the compromise.
which it is understood Mr. Redmond
is ready to offer. Ulster's capital was
almost entirely unaffected by the re
cent rebellion, and the provisions of
martial law have not been enforced.
Everything Is outwardly calm, but
the keenest Interest underlies the sur
face appearance, and many Ulsterites
declare their determination to have no
dealings with the Nationalists. All
the newspapers in Belfast advise cau
tion in regard to any promise that the
Premier may have made, but which
are not yet public property.
Mr, Asqutth returned to Dublin to
night, where it is reported, further
court-martlalB will be conducted open
ly. ' '
REUNION OF COMPANY K.
Staq Party of. Spanish War Veterans
Tuesday Night.
Less than two dozen men, all that
are left locally of 94 who enlisted In
Company K, 1st Vermont regiment, for
the Spanjsh War, held a stag dinner In
the Odd Fellows hall last evening, a
good meal being supplied and served
by the Rebekahs.
The reunion was the 18th anniver
sary of the local boys leaving Penning
ton for the war. After enlisting here,
they mobilized with other Vermont
troops at Burlington where after a
rigid' physical examination and weed
Ing out of the unfit, they were sent to
Chlckamauga which Is as mucii as
they 'saw of the war.
Many of the boys have moved else
where, somo have died In the mean
time., but that did not detract from the
good time at last night's supper. After
the nical a social hour of tstory-telllng
followed.
In tho business meeting which fol
lowed William E. Frost was chosen
president of the local branch of the
United Spanish-American War veter
ans association and E. H. Holden sec
retary.
