Evidence Shows Britisher

(By Review Leased Wire.l
LONDON, May 15. The writing of
a new chapter of the history of the
t.nn Fein rebellion was begun today,
when Sir Roger Casement Knighted
in 1911, for services to the British
government, and Daniel Julian Bailey,
an Irish private soldier, one of his
companions on the ill-fated submarine
tnp from Germany to Ireland, were
placed in the dock of fie Bow Street j
police court for preliminary examina
tion on the charge of high treason.
While considerable testimony in
troduced by the crown tended to in
criminate Bailey, the main attack of
the prosecution was directed against
Casement in an endeavor to enmesh
him in a net of evidence which would
establish without question the lead
ing part it is claimed he played in the
conspiracy, w.i03e ramifications exten
ded even to America.
It was evident that no ordinary pris
oner was before the bar. for 'despite
the unkemnt condition of his cloth
ing he made a striking figure, with
neatly trimmed beard and hair brush
ed well back from a h'.eh forehead,
underneath which vas the deep set
eyes of the dreamer.
Casement busied himself taking I

. GIBP.STOV.W. N. X. May 15. At
least fourteen men were killed and
about 3i injured today in a terrific
explosion at the Repai.no plaut of the
Pupont Powder company, near here.
The blast 'occurred in the building
in which trinitroluol is made and

are:

Some of the injured were taken to

The cause of the explosion is not
known and according to officials of
the plant may never be ascertained
as all those supposed to have been
