P EDITORIAL COMMENT.

Uncle Joe Cannon was 80 years old
the other day and has the distinction
of having spent 40 years in congress,
an uncqualed record.
.France docs not want Germany to of-
'er peace, but to ask for it. The
,ierms must be made by France and
her allies.
Honson entered Coneress by beat
ing Senator Bankhead for the nomi
nation for Congress. The old man
"came backhand landed in the Sen
ate and now his son ousts the hero
from his seat in Congress by just 51
votes.
Richmond Pearson Hopson, the
hero of Santiago, and the original pi
oneer of preparedness, is to leave
Congress just as the whole country
has been brought to see the wisdom
of his views. Such is the irony of
fate.
Secretary Lansing has asked Am
bassador Gerard, at Berlin, to ascer
tain the nature of the punishment im
posed by the German government on
the commander of the submarine
which sunk the steamer Sussex. Mr.
Lansing said the request was not in
the nature of a formal inquiry to the
German government.
Greece is suffering from a sugar
famine, sugar being so scarce that a
government committee distributes it
only on the presentation of cards is
sued to families. Petroleum and
rnnperas also arc obtained only in
Mi United States. Copperas is need
ed to spray the vineyards that are
suffering from insects.

GEORGE SMITH
WON
DERBY
Star Hawk In Sensation
"Come Back" Gets Up
to Second Place.
50,000 PEOPLE SAW IT.
Governor Stanley Puts Lau
rel Wreath on the Win
ners Neck.
Louisville, Ky., May 15. George
Smith, a three-year-old, out of Reach-
Consuelo II, colt, running in the col
ors of John Sanford of Amsterdam,
N. Y., won the forty-second annual
running of the Kentucky derby at
Churchill Downs Saturday. With 1 17
pounds up, the black colt covered the
mile and a quarter in 2:04. He was
third choice in the betting, two dollar
winning pari-mutuel tickets paying
slightly better than 4 to 1. Star
Hawk, A. K. Macombers' English
bred colt, was only half a length be
hind the winner, and gaining at every
stride.
Franklin, J. S. Ward's son of Jim
Gaffney, after having set the pace
part of the way, lasted to win third
money by a head from his stable
mate, Dodge. The other five start
ers were strung out for an eighth of
a mile.
The Harry Payne Whitney pair,
Dominant and Thunderer, installed
heavy favorites, disappointed thous
ands of backers. Dominant,, for a
short distance, encouraged his sup
porters when Jockey Notter hustled
him into the lead at the rise of the
barrier. The heretofore unbeaten
Thunderer, full brother of last year's
derby winner, Regret, never was
prominent.
Star Hawk's performance was sen
sational. Apparently unacquainted
with American post usage, the Eng
lish colt was almost left, and trailed
the field by many lengths, passing
the grand stand the first time. He
did not seem to strike his stride until
half of the race had been run, when
he came witfi a tcrrtho rush, over
taking the field one by one, except
the winner.
One of the largest crowds that
ever attended a derby saw Governor
Stanley of Kentucky place a wreath
of roses around George Smith's neck
and present a bouquet to Jockey
Loftus.

No Activity in Other War
Theaters Is Reported--Both
Sides Lose Heavily.
London, May 15. Asiatic Turkey
is the only war theater where infantry
actions of any great importance arc
reported. On the line in France and
Belgium and in the Austro-ltalian
theater, there have been minor en
gagements. On tlje Russian front
bombardments alone are in progress.
The Russians and the Turks are
continuing their attacks and counter
attacks in the region south of the
Black sea littoral and also west of the
Persian border where the Russians
are endervoring to force their way
through the Mesopotamia region with
Bagdad and a junction with the Brit
ish forces farther south their evident
objectives.
To the northwest of Erzcrum in the
Kope mountain region, Constanti
nople reports heavy losses of Russian
attacks to regain lost positions. Pet-
rograd admits that in this general
region around Eringan and Aschkala,
the Turks forced their advance
guards to retire at some points but
says the Ottoman forces desisted in
their attacks after having suffered ex
tremely heavy casualties.
Farther south to the east of Mosut,
the Russians are throwing a fresh
force into the attack directed against
the Bagdad region. Here they have
occupied the Rowanduz regions,
which lies some 120 miles north of
Kash-i-Shirin, where they were last
reported to be operating. This
would place the Russian troops at
points about 220 miles north and 120
miles northeast of Bagdad.
The region of Le Mort Homme,
northwest of Verdun, again is under
heavy bombardment while east of the
Mouse an intermittent cannonading is
in progress, no infantry attacks
have been attempted. The Germans
succeeded in entering British trenches
in the Ploegsteert wood but were im
mediately ejected, while British pa
trols captured German trenches south
of La Bassee canal. Tec Germans
are showing considerable artillery
activity against numerous sectors held
by the British.
The Italians, according to the Aus
trian communication, launched vigor
ous attacks against the Austrians on
the Dorbcrdo plateau, west of San
Martino, but they were put down af
ter a severe struggle. On the re
minder of this front there hnvo been
only bombardments.
