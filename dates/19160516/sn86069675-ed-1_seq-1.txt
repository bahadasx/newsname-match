.the difference in cash. He also

WILLIAM E. FAULKNER
DIES IN MISSOURI
Hearts were bitterly saddened
when a telegram wns received hero
ono day last week from Kansas
City telling of the denth of William
Elbert Faulkner, son of L. C.
Faulkner, of Plntte county, Mo.
He wns born three miles north of
Mt. Sterling 27 years ago, and
went to Missouri when his father's
family moved there in 1905. He
will be remembered here by many
of the Montgomery county people
as n bright, interesting boy. He is
survived by his father, n devoted
step-mother, two sisters, Mrs. N.
B, Hoskins, of this county, nnd
Mrs. Bennett F. Hughes! of Bards
town, Ky. Four brothers and ono
half brother, Ellis D., of Paols,
Kansas; Clay, of Crawford, Colo.;
Newton, Troy and Vernon, of
Platte City, Mo.
"William Elbert Faulkner was
loved by nil who knew him. At
the early age of 15 he confessed
his Savior before men, enlisting
with the Christian church and has
dlways been one of the lending ac
tive workers in Sunday School nnd
church work. At the nge of 18, in
the very prime of hi boyhood, he
wttsj tricken with typhoid fevci
which left him a cripple and nn in
valid for life. In the spring time
of lifffiwhen all the rest were gay
and free he' bore his cross with
manly fprtitude and a sweet re
signation that partook of the di
vine. In the nine years of his fail
ing health he often spoke of com
ing to Kentucky to visit tho friends
of his childhood when he grew
stronger, but that day never came
and jiow he has found a place far
betfer'-lhan Kentucky. As his phy
sical body weakened the spiritual
life grow stronger and sweeter and
better, until one bright beautiful
morning the earthly temple could
not hold that .strong, radiant soul
any longer, it broke from its de
taining fetters and took its (light
into the realms where eye hath not
seen its wonderful beauty, tho ear
hath not henrd its sweet music.
Thaifuneral services were held in
the church ' where he had lived a
pure Christian life as an open book,
a beautiful example for many.
Ah, our deur one, loving hands
have laiil away the pale form, with
many tears in a prairie grave, and
will watch over it through all the
years that follow. The blue violet
that you always loved will creep
up about you, the Missouri wild
rose will bloom each spring and
send forth its sweet perfume above
you, but when we think of you we
will lift our eyes to tho blue sky,
the shining white clouds that float
by up among tho bright stars, and
to whero tho palo moonlight pene
trates and softly whispers, "Up
there, somewhere." Thanks bo to
t
God, wo have a perfect assurunco
thut you have- gone to dwell with
tho Master you loved, and tho little
mother who long ago nestled you
to her heart for a few short years
and then went over into tho Sweet
Byo-and-Byo to await your com
ing. "Oh denth, whero is thy sting?
O grave, whero is thy victory?"

GEORGE SMITH WINS DERBY
Before a crowd of about 45,000
persons, George Smith, tho Snnford
colt, defeated a field of nine start
ers, and thereby won the Kentucky
Derby nt Louisville Saturday. The
purse was for $15,000 and the win
ner received close to $10,000. Star
Hawk, the English-owned colt,
made his first start in this 'country
and finished a btrong second, being
only hnlf a length behind the win
ner and gaining nt every jump.
Under n better ride it is thought
Star Hawk would have been re
turned the winner, as he was han
dled very poorly. Jockey Loftus
rode the winner and used splendid
judgment throughout the race.
Franklin, the Blue Grass favorite,
finished third, being several lengths
behind the winner. Dominant and
Thunderer, the Whitney entry, and
favorites in the betting, led in the
early stages of the race but were
unable to stand the distance. The
race was attended by quite a few
local sports, a number tf whom had
tickets on the winner, which paid
$10.30 to $2.00. On account of the
immenso crowd a number of wagers
which were sent down by local 'men
were not "put on," as it was almost
impossible to gVi to the betting
booths.
MT. STERLING WINS.
The Lexington Reserves lost one
of the most hotly contested baseball
gamps ever played in (this city
Sunday afternoon, when the Mt.
Sterling tenm won an eleven inning

Riddell's park. The game was won
in the eleventh inning after two
men were out when Kellv, for the
... i i
locals, drove a two base hitto loft
center field. ' The game was a
pitcher-.' battle between Vnllnnd
ingham, for the locals, and Stuart,
for Lexington. A large crowd , wit
nessed the contest, which was re
plete with brilliant plays. Stuart
struck out three Mt. Sterling bats
men in the tenth inning on '"nine
balls.
