UNDERSTANDING ONE
ANOTHER ANY WAY
(BY ASSOCIATED PROS)
WASHINGTON, May 16?The re-;
suit of the military conference at EI-;
Paso as reported today by Major
General Scott to Secretary Baker has
been to convince the Carranza gov
ernment that the United States has
no other purpose in its operations in :
northern Mexico than to strfmp out |
.brigandage and as a consequence
there exists substantially an unwrit- j
ten understanding that the Carranza j
forces shall endeavor to demonstrate
their ability to handle the situation
as the necessary first step toward
withdrawal of the American punitive
expedition.
General Scott believes General Ob
regon is acting in good faith and that
the border situation is less critical
today so far as the United States
government is concerned.

stead at Wyatt for many years.
Mr. Hess Is a successful and Intelli
gent farmer, and has devoted consid
erable time to bridge contracting In
this and adjoining counties. Being by
nature and education a man of stu
dious habits and thoughtful mind, he
has accumulated a fund of Informa

age householder that peculiarly fit him
for legislative duties. He has taken a
lively interest in the public school
system and has served with satisfac
tion an the president of his district
board of education.

CASEMENT'S TRIAL
DRAWING GROWDS
People Stand in Line for Hours
before the Hour for Open
ing Court Comes.
CBV AIIOCI' TBO PUIS*)
J OX DON. May 16.?For hours tills
morning crowds of poonle stood it: lino
lOiind Bow street policc station wa't
ing for the resumption of the arraign
ment of Sir Roger Casement on
charges of high treason in connection
with the Sinn Fein rebellion.
John McCarthy, a farmer of Curra
hane. County Kerry, told of finding
the collapsible boat In which Case
ment, Bailey and a man named Mon
telth, who IB still at large, landed at!
Tralee. McCarthy said he pulled It |
ashore and found a dagger and a tin
box. On his way home ho met his
children who were playing with three
revolvers they had found near the
shore.
Other witnesses from the same dls
Irict told of having seen signal lights
at sea on the evening before Good
Friday.
A touch of humor was added when
Mary Gorman told her story of meet
ing Casement and two companies
as they were leaving the beach. She
talked in a brogue so broad that It
I
j was necessary to ask her to write .the
words before they could be under
stood. This she did smilingly. After
j identifying Casement she told how
she had seon him later in the day In
the custody of a constable. She did
not recognize Bailey.
The star witness from the stand-j
point of human interest was Martin
Collins, a farmer's lad of twelve
years, who was called to identify
Casement os one of the men arrested
near Tralee. Martin, a handsome
little chap, told with evident prido
how he had driven Casement and *
constable for several miles when the
prisoner was being taken headquar
ters. Much of the time he was testi
fying the boy kept his eyes on Case
ment and there was no hesitation on
his part as ho declared that the man
in the dock was the one he had
driven in his cart.
After the , hearing had been in
progress for sometime Casement
turned his attention from the testi
mony to the writing of a long state
ment. While thus engaged he showed
marked emotion. Whatever was the
nature or his thoughts they were
such that they moved him to tears.
He wept quietly as he worked away
with his pencil. It was a striking
change from the smiling and self
confident man of a short time before.

Is the Overshadowing Feature
in the Primary Election in
State of Pennsylvania.
(?V ABIOCIATKO FRIlfll
PHILADELPHIA. May 16?Pri
mary elections for all political parties
wore held throughout Pennsylvania
today. The voters for the first time
are participating In a preferential
presidential election but little Inter
est Is being taken In this as there Is
one name netered oil each of the
party tickets.
President Wilson's name Is the
only one on the Democratic ballot.
Governor Martin O. Brumbaugh Is
alone on the Republican ticket, and
Allen L. Uenson, of Yonkers, N. Y?
who has already received the Social
ist .nomination for president by refer
endum of the Socialists of the coun
try, was tho only name placed on the
ballot of that party for president. It
Is expected that many of the other
candidate for president will receive
a large scattering vote by means of
voters writing the candidate's name
on the ballot.
The greatest Interest In the pri
mary center In the fight within the
Republican party for control of the
delegation to the national conven

Penrose Is opposed to Governor
Brumbaugh and each faction has set
up a separate set of twelve delegates

RYE HAY
Cutting Time is Explained by
William D. Zinn, the
' County Agent.
More than fifty farmers hare called
on the county agent during the last
few days to know at what stage they
should cut their rye for hay.
The growing of rye for hay la such
a new thing that our stations have
little or no data on the subject W. D.
Zlnn, the writer, has cut It when It
was Just coming In head, when all the
heads were out and when In bloom and
It Is his opinion, though he cannot
prove It by any station reports, that It
will be relished more and digested bet
ter If It Is cut about the time It comes
Into head. K greater tonnage, how
ever, will be obtained If the rye Is left
until about ready to come Into bloom.
A great many fields should be cut this
week. Some that was sown late or
have been pastured heavily may go
over until next week and possibly until
the last of the same. It does not seem
to be Injured much by getting wet
though, of course. It Is desirable to put
It up without rain If possible. It may
be stacked outside but like all other
rouch food It Is better It housed.
