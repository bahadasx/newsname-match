May 16. Francisco Villa has recov

been busy fo.- some weeks attempting
to raise a new army in the state of
Durango, according to a story told
here today by a Mexican who was cap
tured in the engagement at Ojos
Azules, late in April.
Cavalrymen are riding hard on the
trail of small bands of Mexicans in
the vicinity of Kubio ranch, 20 miles
from here where three Villa followers
were slain by an American forage de
tachment yesterday. It was reported
there were about 70 in the band. Julio

Columbus X. M.. May 16. Flying
cavalry detachment today- raced
through the foothills west of Rublo
ranch in pursuit of seventy Villistas,
whose scouts were killed in an attack
on Lieutenant Patton's small command
at the ranch on Sunday. When the
fight was over, with the Mexican trio
dead in the corral, friendly natives in
formed the Americans that a strong
band was proceeding westward. The
three slain Villistas. they said, were
stationed at the rear of the column
to act as scouts. American detach
ments were sent out immediately to
pursue and break up the band. To
day they were reported close on the
heels of the Villistas in the pursuit
through the hills.
The Villistas were clad in odds and
ends of uniforms, the natives said.
Pome wore parts of American cavalry
men's clothing.
Withdrawal Revives Villa's Hope.
The withdrawal from the advance
base at San Antonio was the signal
for renewed Villista activities among
the natives, according to advices here.

TO BACK UP WILSON
Resolution Before Congress to Support
Him in Maintaining Neutrality.
Washington, May 16. A concurrent
resolution to pledge congress and the
people of the United States to support
all efforts of the president to main
tain "even-handed and undiscriminat
ing" neutrality and facilitate the
establishment of a permanent peace,
has been introduced by Senator Gore
and at his request was laid over with
out discussion.
A OOOD THING.
The ttate Journal reminds the people
of this city that there is a fine oppor
tunity awaiting them for a good in
vestment during the next six weeks,
if any one have a little surplus cash
saved up. The city of Topeka will is
sue paving bonds to the amount of
$200,000 or thereabouts, between
now and July 1. These bonds have
been drawn for four and one-half per
cent usually; interest payable semi
annually. The bonds are non-taxable.
Commissioner Wasson is planning
to issue them in denominations as low
as $100; some will be for $500; some
for $1,000.
They are gilt edged securities and are
transferable as easily as a one hun- !
dred dollar bill.
It may be that these bonds can be
placed for less than four and one-half
per cent in as much as the bankers
tell us there is so much cheap money".
Perhaps it would be a good thing for
the city to dispose of these bonds to
the highest bidder.
Any reader of the State Journal
having $100 or more which he desires
to invest is advised to write to Com
missioner Wasson and file his applica
tion for some of these bonds.

General Believes Obregon Is
Acting in Good Faith.
Border Situation Less Critical
Than at Any Time.
10,000 MEX TO- GREAT BEND
De Factos Heavily Police the
Parral District,
Funston Proposes Motorcycle
Patrol of Border.
Washington, May 16. Th net re
sult of the military conference at El
Paso as reported by Major General
Scott to Secretary Baker has been to
convince the Carranza government
that the United States has no other
purpose in its operations in northern
Mexico than to stamp out brigandage
and as a consequence there exists
substantially an unwritten under
standing that the Carranza forces
a hall endeavor to demonstrate their
ability to handle the situation as the
necessary first step toward withdrawal
of the American punitive expedition.
GeneraJ Scott believes General
Obregon is acting in good faith and
that the border situation is less criti
cal today so far as the American gov
ernment is concerned.
Predict New Demand.
Mexico Citv. May 16. It is expected
here that promptly after the arrival of
General Obregon the Mexican govern
ment will frame new demands upon
the United States asking for the im
mediate recall of American troops.
Obregon is due here today.
Municipal elections will be called for
June 1 throughout the republic These
are the first elections to be held since
Huerta's time.
Obregon to Police Parral.
To carry out his share of the plans
General Obregon has agreed to oc
cupy and police the Parral district,
scouring the mountainous regions to
the west of that town in search of the
remnants of Villa's followers. He also
agreed to establish a strong patrol line
along the Mexican side of the Big
Bend country to prevent incursions
such as that at Glenn Springs- and Bo
q nil las. For that purpose General
Obregon has ordered into those re
gions 10.000 troops under General
Trevino. said to be the most efficient
field commander in the Carranza
army. Advices to the war and state
departments indicate the movements
are being carried out promptly.
Another important element, and
cne which American army officers re
garded as most vital to General Per
shing's line of communications was
cleared up by General Obreron's
agreement not to bring the large force
of Carranza troops in Sonora through
Pulpit Pass into General jpersnings
rear.
Won't Embarrass F2arh Other.
On their sride. General Scott and
General Funston assured General
Obregon that precautions would be
taken by American commanders not
to dispose their forces as to embar
rass the operation of the Mexican
troops and also that the border patrol
on the American side would be
strengthened.
As to Villa himself neither American
or Mexican officials seem to have any
knowledge of his present whereabouts
or anything positive to show he i9 still
alive. General Obregon believes him
dead.
The first step encountered by the
American conferees at El Paso was
the necessity of convincing General
Obregon thr-t the expedition after
Villa was not an intervention step.
The size and composition of the force
aroused alarm among Mexican of
ficials and it was pointed out to Scott
that it was not customary for posses
in pursuit of one man to go with field
runs and mountain artillerv

CONFER ON BILL
Both Houses to Get Together
on Rural Credits.
House Bill Is More Liberal to
Borrowers.
FARM LOANS AT 6 PEB GENT
Shipping Bill Win Come to Vote
Next Friday.
Democrat Leaders Believe
Will Be Passed Quickly.
It
Washington, May 16. Rural credits
legislation was nearer enactment to
day because of passage of the house
late yesterday of the Glass bill by a
vote of 295 to 10. Differences between
this measure and the bill already
passed by the senate probably will be
ironed out soon in conference;
The house bill contains provisions
more liberal for borrowers than the
senate measure. Both measures would
provide for a federal farm loan board
and 12 land banks which would loan
money to farmers at a six per cent
maximum rate through local land as
sociations on mortgages running from
five to 26 years. The banks would
make these mortgages a basis for is
suance of farm loan bonds.
Vote on Shipping Bill Friday.
Under a rule limiting general debate
to five hours and providing for a final
vote Friday night the house today be
gan consideration of the administra
tion shipping bill. The way had been
cleared for work on the bill by the
bouse when it finally disposed late
yesterday of the rural credits measure.
House Democratic leaders apparent
ly are confidence of its passage. In
addition to the united support of their
own party for the measure they are
understood to count upon the votes of
several Republicans. Incorporation of
a provision setting a time limit on gov
ernment operations of vessels is be
lieved to have won many over to the
bill.
Assails Republicans' Tactics.
Chairman Alexander of the marine
committee opened the speaking for
the bill. Democratic Leader Kitchin
urged the house to pass the rule for
its consideration. Mr. Kitchin assailed
the Republicans for filibustering and
said :
"We will pass this bill, appropria
tion bills, and other important meas
ures and be ready to adjourn by July

duty."

Troubles of the national order of

Sensational charges of misappropri
ation of funds by officers and em
ployees of the society are contained in
the petition. Kirkpatrick charges
that large sums of money were paid
to persons illegally kept on the pay
rolls and who were not devoting their
time to the good of the order. The
president of the society also alleges
that the funds and offices of the so
ciety have been used in an effort to

Through E. D. McKeeVer, his attor

for a writ of mandamus. It was the
first open move in the fight which

With His Six-Shooter
In Hand Cowboy Lover
Demands Topeka Maid
L F. Fountain of Pratt, 6-Feet-Four, Here to
Claim His Vision of Prairies, His Face
of the Purple Sunrise.
But She Didn't Care Even as You and I and He
Carried His Artillery to Her Very
Door on West Seventh.
"High-heeled boots, a broad-
brimmed Stetson, corduroy trousers, a
flannel shirt, a blue handkerchief for
a collar and a six foot four man inside
of them, are all right in their proper
setting. Associated with a lariat, a
cow-pony and prairies that fade away
into distance they form a combination
that might appeal to any city girl and
justify a summer flirtation.
But somehow the romance that sur
rounds such a combination on its na
tive heath has a habit of fading away
when the man togs up in store clothes
and makes a visit to the girl's home
town.
That's the reason L. F. Fountain is
in the Shawnee county jail and Marie
Palmer has gone away on a visit.
That's the main reason, although the
interval between the alleged flirtation
and Fountain's arrest today is filled
with reasons. Miss Palmer says it was
a flirtation. Fountain says it was the
most serious thing that ever happened
to him.
Fountain lives in what is left of the
cow country down in Pratt county.
He is typical of that country twenty
years ago. Marie Palmer visited in his
neighborhood with the latest creations
from Topeka millinery and dressmak
ing establishments. Fountain fell and
he fell hard. He decided there was
just one woman in the world for him
and she was not one of the Pratt
county girls. He didnt tell Miss Pal
mer all this at the time. He's telling
about it now.
To just what extent Miss Palmer en
couraged the lengthy cowboy has not
been made clear but when she came
away she thought the affair was all
over. She just closed the cover on a
brief leaflet of romance and forgot it.
But not so with Fountain. He saw
her face in the . first purple of the
prairie sunrise, .he saw it in the mirage
at noonday- and he saw it in the sun
set- glow. . It waa. constantly before
mm, ne says. He couldn't forget.
Buys Ticket for Topeka.
One day he turned, his pony out to
grass, tnrew his saddle and bridle in
a corner of the ranch house, dressed
up in his store clothes and bought a
ucicei ior nis gin s home town. The
only familiar thine he wore when he
stepped from the train in Topeka was
his artillery. He carried a six-shooter
in a holster and an idea in his brain.
Hie idea was to take Marie Palmer
back with him, peaceably if possible,
but to take her back.
The next chapter of the story was
told by Miss Palmer to county offi
cials more than a week ago. Fountain
called at Miss Palmer's home and
calmly announced that he had jour
neyed to Topeka ' to wed her. She
couldn't see it that way. He didn't
look like the same fellow she had
known out west. The store clothes
spoiled the effect. Out on the prairie
he had been a picturesque figure.
Out on West Seventh street, in To
peka, he was just a tall, gangling
man with clothes that wouldn't pass
inspection at a fashion show.
When Miss Palmer demurred Foun
tain pulled his six-shooter she says
and threatened to make a sieve of

Akron, Ohio. May IS. State and

the Crystal restaurant here last night
in which nine persons were killed and
28 injured, two probably fatally.
Searchers completed a hunt of the

Nine bodies recovered last night

ORDER KING DEPOSED
French Suspect He was Instrumental

Shanghai. May IS. The governor

of An nam deposed on charges of com
plicity in riots which occurred in the
towns of Qnang-Ngai and Quang-Nan.
The riots were speedily suppressed.
The king of Annam has been prac

the French established a protectorate
over the country, similar to that main

She Called an Officer.
That night Miss Palmer and a wo
man friend became frightened. They
thought Fountain might carry out his
threat to shoot up West Seventh street
and she called up a county official.
The official hurried over and was
talking with the two women upstairs
when the telephone rang. Miss Palm
er went to the telephone which was in
the stair landing.
Half a minute later a feminine
scream pierced the air and the county
official reached the top of the stairs
in time to hear the girl throw the tel
ephone receiver away and shout; .
"Here he comes, now!"
The girl scrambled up the stairs out
of the dark. The county official stood
his ground in the light with a little
old thirty-two in his hand. He heard
someone blundering around below in
the dark.
"Make yourself known down there
or I'll shoot, ' said the official.
"For Heaven's sake don't shoot,"
came a voice out of the darkness. "I
haven't done anything. I'm one of the
roomers."
Temporarily that ended the scare.
The county official called L. L. Kiene,
sheriff, and the two started out to
make a search for Fountain. The only
description they had was that he was
six feet four inches tall.
They Saw a Form.
Late that night they visited a Turk
ish bath parlor and on one of the
tables, under a sheet they saw a form
that looked like it might be seven feet
long.
"Who is that fellow?" Kiene asked
of an attendant.
"I don't know what his name is."
was the reply, "but he came from
western Kansas and he told: me before
he went to sleep that he was going to
marry and take a Topka girl home
with him or know the reason why.
That's thft.marh'Vsald Kii .
Fountain was pulled out from under
the sheet and dressed in his own cloth
ing. Then he- was given explicit di
rections as to the location of the Rock
Island station.
"But I don't want to leave," he pro
tested. "I came down here to marry a
girl. I'm going to marry. Men, you
aon i Know now i love tnat woman,
you don't know," and he struck
a Shakespearian attitude hand on
heart.
Finally he agreed to leave, to take
me nrst train out of town. He didn't
take that train, inquiries at the station
showed, but he did leave town. Short
ly after he was gone the officials re
ceived word from Larned to the effect
that checks Fountain had been cash
ing in Topeka in order to keep up the
fight for the hand and heart of Ma
rie Palmer were bogus. - Kiene was
ordered to arrest him.
Fountain avoided arrest until this
morning when Hugh Larimer, under
sheriff, sighted him standing in front
of the New England builaing. He of
fered no resistance whatever and kept
Larimer running in order to reach the
jail along with him.
Sheriff C. H. Dexter of Lamed has
been notified of the arrest.
ARMY WILL GROW
Revised Bill Provides for Force
of 718,500 Men.
Regular Army Will Be 211,000
in Time of Peace.
Washington, May IS. Revised fig
ures on the army reorganization bill
as agreed upon by house and senate
conferees and submitted to the senate
today by Chairman Chamberlain, show
that the new army will be even larger
than announced when agreement was
reached last Saturday.
Careful analysis shows the maxi

be 211,000 officers and men, including
25.000 staff and troops, Philippine
scouts and unasaigned recruits, and
that the war strength will be 236.500
officers and combatant troops, which
with staff troops, etc.. added, will
bring the aggregate maximum
strength of the regular army to 261.

Court Room Today.
BY WlLBrTl S. TORItKST. " .
London, May 16. John McCarthy, a
Kerry county farmer with a thick
Irish brogue, upset the plans prepared
months in advance at Berlin for Sir
Roger Casement to lead a rebellion
that would sweep Ireland. - -
This fact was disclosed today when
the preliminary hearing of Casement,
and one of his Irish soldier confed
erates, Daniel Bailey, was resumed in
Bow street police court. It was Mc
Carthy and not the British secret Mr
vice that caused Sir Roger's capture. '
McCarthy's brogue was so rich that
the court and spectators had difficulty
understanding him. He told a story
rivaling fiction.
On the morning of Good Friday,
McCarthy said, he was walking alons
the Irish coast near Tralee, when he
noted a small boat floating toward
shore. He walked down to the beach
to pull it in and noticed the free foot
prints of three persons in the sand.
Aroused McCarthy's Suspicion. i
For some reason the footprints
aroused McCarthy's suspicions. He
sent word to the barracks and im
mediately officers were sent out to in
vestigate. . i. -
Sergeant Heme, of the Irish con
stabulary, took up the story where the
Kerry county farmer left off. He -said
the police were scattered over a wide
area along the coast when news of
the landing of three men was received
at the barracks.
After considerable searcn7 Herne

known as McKinna's fort. The pris

rest, he said, stating that his name
was Richard Morton and that he was
an author.
In spite of his protest, he was
escorted to the Ardfert barracks after
he had dropped a paper upon which
were the words:
"Await further instructions.' Hav
decided to stay. Further ammunition,
and rifles are needed. Send another
ship." .
