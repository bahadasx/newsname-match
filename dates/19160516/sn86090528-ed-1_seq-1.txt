called the convention to order shortly,
after io o'clock.
Following' the Invocation, the ad
dress of welcome was delivered by,
A. E. Vaught, president of the Okla
homa City chamber of commerce
John J. Geiioch, president of the Ger-
loch bank, ot Woodward, responded.
After the close of Mr. Gertoch'B re
marks, President Dwyer delivered hl$
annual address. '
"Circumstances extraordinary and
without precedent In the history of
the world surround us," Bald Mr.
Dwyer. "One searches the pages oi
history in vain for anything similar'
to the condition of mankind today.
More than one-half ot the civilizd
world .has been engaged for nearly
two years in a conflict that Is break
ing down" the accomplishments ot
centuries and setting back the hand,
on the dial of time perhaps a thous
and; years." '
The spealoer stated that one ot thef
worst features of the titanic struggle
was that it was serving to break down
our faith tn humanity and to arouse
a serious kloubt in our ability to ad
vance beymd the stairo of barbarism.
Continuing the speaker said in part:,
Panic Averted.
"As bankers we should be specially
thankful tor the record of the past
year. If we doubted the wisdom, of
the new federal reserve system at the
time It was adopted, If some of us
still think: that the system could be
simplified and rendered less expen
sive, without being less useful, we
still must bear in mind, with due
gratitude, that had it not been for
this new financial system the tre
mendous shock of the present, world
disaster would. . in all probability
have ciused a financial panic in this
country that it might have taken a
decade to eliminate from considera
tiou. It is indeed phenomenal that
in the face of this world crisis it ha.'
been possible for the banking busi
ness of this country to enjoy securi
ty and prosperity, and we must, if wi
are honest with ourselves, give a rea
sonable measure of credit for thi
fortunate situation to the new cui,
rency system which was adopted jus
in the niche of time to be of use i;
this epoch making period.
America Dominates.
"American financiers now dominat
the money markets of the world. W
have been piling up wealth in thi
country at a tremendous rate at th
very time when the nations of the ol
world have been wrecking their fo
tunes. Hence, in comparison wit
them we have taken the lead at
double pace and the distance we aw
now iu advance of the Old World pe
pies is impossible to estimate. Tl
