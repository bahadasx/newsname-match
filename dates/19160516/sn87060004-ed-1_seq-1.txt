to Paralytic
Stroke
THE END CAME SUDDENLY
Mr. Michael Hanna, founder and
president of the Earlington Machine
Works, died at his home in this city
Saturday nighat 9 o'clock of par
,M alysis. Mr. Hanna returned on Fri
day morning from a business trip to
Hopkinsville, seemingly in better
health than he had been for many
years, but on Saturday morning at 0
o'clock the family weje awakened by
a noise from his room and found him
suffering from a paralytic stroke,
which was the third one within the
past few years. All was done for
him that medical skill could do but
he sank rapidly and passed away on
the evening of the same day. Mr.
Hanna was a man of unusual energy
and could he have chosen the end this
would have been as he wished for he
chafed under inactivity, and while the
shock to the family was almost un
bearable, they find consolation in this
thought.
Michael Hanna was born in the
'beautiful city of Vienna, Austria, in
ihe year 1841 and at the age of 13
' years took up his life's work, that of
an iron foundryman. At the age of
18 he enlisted in the Austrian army
and served until he came to America
twelve years later. He then settled
at LaPorte, Indiana, and the same
year was married to Miss Teresa
Weidman, a native of Bavaria. Of
this happy union ten children were
!)orn, eight daughters and two sons,
all of whom are surviving their
mother and father but two, Mrs.
J. P. McElfatrick, and still another
daughter, Teresa, who was drowned
while skating about twelve years ago
The surviving children are: Miss
Cecelia Hanna, secretary of the Earl
ington Machine Works; Michael
Hanna, Jr , general manager; Mrs.
John linen, ot bvansvwe; miss ai
ma Hanna, who is a trained nurse in
St. Thomas Hospital, Nashville;
Miss Antoinette Hanna, who holds a
responsible government position in
Tacoma.Wash; and Misses Amelia
and Veronica Hanna. John, the
joungest sonfc is a student at Norte

to their beloved father, except Miss
Nettie, who was unable to reach here

ber, on Monday morning and was
attended by a large number of sor
rowing relatives and mends Rev.

cemetery. The pallbearers were:
Messrs C M. Henry, Thos. Blair,

man, six of his special friends.
Mr Hanna was well and favorably
known both in Hopkins and Chris
tian counties where he has made his
home for many years, coming to
Earlington from Madisonville many
years ago, where he has since re
sided cminuously. He was an In-
terestingJker and his reminiscences
of the old country were a delight to
his friends. Whenever he v as ill he
always used his native language
which sometimes proved quite puz
zling to members of his family.
The floral emblems, which were
many and beautiful, were a mute, ev
Jdence of the esteem and friendship
n held for this departed citizen by our
