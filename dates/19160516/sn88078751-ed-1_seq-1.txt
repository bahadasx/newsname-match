SLIT REACHES
WASHINGTON
Will
Hold
Extended
Secretary
Cabinet lo
The Diplomatic
Washington, May 15. Mnfor Gen
eral Scott arrived from the border to
day and will hold an extended con
ference with Secretary of Stato Lan
cing after making a full report of his
parleys with General Obregon, Cnr
ranza's minister of war. It Is possi
blo also that before the cabinet meet
ing tomorrow the general -will see
Fresident Wilson. "
The cabinet tomorrow will probably
consider the character of the diplo
matic negotiations which will succeed
tho military conferences on the bor
der, and it is expected that before
tho end of the week there will begin
a series of interviews between Secre
tary Lansing and Ellseo Arredondo,
tho Mexican ambassador designate.
Tho war department received no
newB from Major General Funston to
show that Major Langhornc, com
manding tho second punitive expedi
tion sent in pursuit of the raiders who
attacked Glenn Springs and Bou
qulllas, had encountered the bandits.
President Wilson returned this,
morning from his week-end yachting'
trip on the Mayflower. He is said to
be resisting strong pressure from
members of his own cabinet in sup
port of intervention. One or two of
the members are said to be using the
argument of politics in favor of such
move. Tho president, however, is
reported as absolutely fixed in his de
termination not to resort to such a
move unless the Carranza forces in
Mexico turn against the American
troops, or attempt any attack on
American towns along the border.
Pending the developments of Car
ranza's attitude the administration Is
holding ilrmly to its recent policy of
refusing to permit shipments of arms
and ammunitions to cross the border,
whether consigned to the Carranza
authorities or not.
Major General Frederick Funston
tas begun the consideration of a plan
for the reorganlzntior of the border
patrol. Having under his direct con
'tiol almost 50,000 men, he outlined to
his staff a .redistribution of forces
that he believed would guarantee the
protection of American residents
from Mexican raiders.
PERSHING TALKS
American Army In Mexico In No Dan
ger of Attack.
Columbus, N. M., May 15. General
Pershing, commander of tho expedi
tion into Mexico, visited tho camp
near Laguna do Itascate on a tour of

tho alarmist rumors to the effect that

Is fully "able to cope with any situa
tion which may arise, but you may
cay also that there Is no danger of an
attack by any source or direction.

Rl Paso. Tex., May 15. On orders
f:om General Fred Funston, General
George Boll, Jr., commanding the

FACES CHARGE
OF TREASON
Sir Roger Casement Is Placed
on Trial In London,
DEEP INTEREST SHOWN IN CASE
Modification In Regulations of Mar.
tlal Law Gives the People of Dublin
More Freeaom of Movemeni Pre
mier Asqulth Studying Condition In
the Irish Capital Disposition of
Rebel Prisoners.
London, May 15. The trial of Sir
Roger Casement on the charge of
treason began today in Bow street
police cburt. Formal preliminary pro
ceedings marked the first session.
Three of England's leading Judges
will try Casement, Including the lord
chief justice, Baron Reading. E. F.
Smith, attorney general, will lead the
counsel for the crown. George G.
Duffy will be the solicitor in chargo
of the prisoner's case, and ArtemuB
Jones is expected to act as counsel.
Casement's request that he be defend
ed by Sir Edward Carson, tho Ulster
He leader, was refused.
Ever since Sir Roger was arrested
a few days before the revolutionary
outbreak in Ireland, while attempting
to land arms and ammunition on tho
Irish coast which were to aid the
rebels, the Interest of the British peo
ple has been eagerly concentrated
upon the cell in the Tower of London,
where Casement awaited trial.
Modification in the regulations of
rjartial law gave the people of Dublin
n freedom of movement strongly con
trasting with the restriction imposed
since the rebellion. All may now come
and go as they wish between the
rours of 4 in the morning and mid
night. During the remaining four
hours they must kqep within doors.
It is generally understood that Pre
mier Asqulth Is responsible for this
relaxation.
The premier'3 study of conditions
and the sentiments of the people am
j.ly convinced him that there was no
great element of rebellious spirit re
maining. Mr. Asquith's chief occu
pation since his arrival in Dublin has
consisted in seeking a method for the
adjustment of the Irish crisis and in
ascertaining whether it would be ad
visable to return to foe former sys
tem of government or adoplj a change
cf rule more in accordance with the
wishes of the people, me premier
also has given some attention to
minor factors, these having to do
with the disposition of the remaining
rebel prisoners and compensation for
the material damage done In Dublin.
