engagements.

Do Not Want Peace.
The speech of President Poincarc,

nouncement of the French policy on
the subject of peace:
The Thames says:
'The discourse of the President ot
the Republic is more than an Impres­

there is no need for deception in Ber­

where the Ilea of eventual mediations
is entertained among those without
authority and without responsibility."

TO TRY ORFERT
Trial of Former Wisconsin Uni­

Waukegon, 111.
Chicago, May 15.—From a couft
room of farmers, whose hearts were
back in the fields, which need atten­
tion, Zionites, whose religious rute3
would prevent them from inflicting
the death penalty, three men were
tentatively accepted today to try Wil­
liam H. Orpert, charged with the
murder of Marion Lambert. Two of
them probably will be excused, one
because he has three motherless chil­
dren to care for, and the other b&
cause of the serious illness of his
wife. Alfred Stickels, a teamster, al­
though he said that circumstantial
evidence would have to be "mighty
strong" to convince him, was said to
have a chance of remaining.
The trial opened. in the barnlike
old court house at Waukegan, (before
Judge Charles H. O'Donnelly. Or­
pert, 20 years old, and pale from
three months in jail, sat by his fath­
er, a bearded man of huge stature.
'His mother was also present.

D., 'May 15.—Roth Rort-
house entered a plea of guilty before
Judge E. Leighton of the district
court today to a charge of rape in
the first degree and was sentenced to
four years in the state penitentiary.
The diaibolical crime was committed
against a young girl.
The criminal has a vicious record
of crime behind him and was the ben­
eficiary of the pardon board's parole.
Some time ago he, in connection with
another man, stole an automobile and
fled to South Dakota, but was ar­
rested and brought back and convict­
ed. While serving time for this crime
he was put on parole and before his
parole had expired, committed the
crime for which lie was sent across
again today.

LEADER
TO FACE TIL
Sir Roger Casement and Compan­
ion in Expedition Are Placed
in Docks.
FORMER DIPLOMAT IS
CENTER OF ALL EYES
Crown Attorneys Will Attempt to
Establish Fact Casement
Was Leader.
London, May 15.—The writing of a
new chapter of the history of the
Sinn-Feinn rebellion was begun to­
day, when Sir Roger Casement,
knighted, in 1911, for services to tho
British government and Daniel A.
Bailey, an Irish private soldier, one
of his companions on the ill-fated Sub­
marine trip from Germany to Ireland,
were placed in the docks of the Bow
Street police court for preliminary
examination on the charge of high
treason."
While considerable testimony intro­
duced by the Crown tended to in­
criminate Bailey, the main attack was
directed against Casement, in an en­
deavor to enmesh him in a net of
evidence which would establish with­
out question the leading part it is
claimed he played in the conspiracy,
whose ramification extended even tj
America.
Casement Takes Notes.
Casement, himself, was the centei
of all eyes, during the day. He busied
himself taking notes indicating that
he intended to have a hand in the
presentation of his defense. He was
always self-possessed, and as the
case 'yvent on, began to assume con­
siderable assurance.
The testimony developed few thrills,
rhe
prosecution devoting its attention
to showing how Casement carrier! on
ilip- alleged requiting fo'.' his Irish
brigade in German prison camps. The
rcqst dramatic pnrt of the whole pio-
:t?O!
tending was the address of Attorney
General Sir' Freclf" ictk E. Smith.
General introduced a/letter written by
Casement, thanking Sir. Edward Grey,
the British Secretary for Foreign Af
frirs, for the knighthood conferred
upon him in recognition of his diplo­
matic services.

DOZEN PERSONS KILLED
AND A SCORE INJURED
National Guards Called Out to
Restrain Mob That Gathered

Akron, Ohio. May 16.—At' least a
dozen persons were killed and nearly
a score injured early this evening,
when the old Beacon Journal Build­
ing, occupied by (.lie Crystal Restau­
rant collapsed as a result of a blast
of dynamite in an adjoining excava­
tion.
Seven Identified and three uniden­
tified bodies have been recovered and
two now missing are thought to bo
in the ruins. Battery "B", Ohio Na­
tional Guards, Field Artillery, was
called out to aid the police in re­
straining a crowd of more than 10,
000 persons, who packed the streets
at Main and Quarry, where the acci­
dent occurred.
A tremendous roar, echoing the
screams of the dying people, brought
thousands to the disastrous scene in
the heart of Akron's business district.
Instantly the entire city rallying un­
der the shock plunged to the work
of rescue.
A great pile of ruins, broken timbers
twisted steel, aid tons of brick and
mcrtar, bi-ied '.he victims, who a
nmuent be:'M we dining in ll:f res­
taurant. Eight bodies were snon tak­
en out of the wreckage, after firemen,
police and volunteer workers had
worked frantically digging through the
debris.
Rushed to
ttfiMteen inote, many of them fatal­
ly injured, we?e/extricated and seat
to' the City and Peoples hospitals.
Only two or three of the others known
to have been in the restaurant' suc­
ceeded in escaping before the crash.
George Zerris, who with his brother,
Augustus Zerris, owned the restau­
rant, escaped from the kitchen of the
collapsing restaurant', together with a
cook and two dishwashers, but all
were injured by falling brick.
Blasts of dynamite set off in an
excavation for a new building directly
north of the restaurant unsettled the
foundation. The restaurant was a
one-story structure with a two story
false front, and the latter toppling
backward added a weight of many
tons to the falling ruins.
Place Was Crowded.
The crash came at 6:10 p. m. in
the midst of the dinner, when the res­
taurant was crowded and when thou­
sands were on the streets during the
evening rush. So suddenly did the
coiling come in and the walls crumb­
led that those who were not instantly
kiiled were knocked unconscious.
iU:s. W. C. Lawson, who escaped
strangely from the table where she,
lie:- husband, and their eight-year-old
daughter, Mary, were dining togeth­
er. wir, the first person rescued. The
first body to be dug up from the deb­
ris was that of little Mary Lawson,
her daughter. Firemen dug her out.
She probably had been strangled to
death by a cable falling on her. A
piece of bread she was eating was
still clutched in her hands.

Washington, 'May 15.—Both- the
slate department and General Car*
ranza are awaiting detailed reports
of the recent El Paso military con­
ference before seeking an agreement
as to the border situation through
diplomatic conversations. Gen. Scott,
chief of staff of the army returned
here today, optimistic over the mili­
tary situation, confident that the
meeting between him and Gen. Funs
ton on the one side and Gen. Obre
gon, Carranza's war minister, on the
other, had created a 'better under­
standing between the two govern­
ments, which might form the basis
for the protocol.
Elisio Arredondo, the Mexican am­
bassador designate, asked for instruc­
tions last week, but Gen. Obregon
will probably not reach Mexico City
for several days. The state and war
departments' advices showed no
change today along the iborder. Ad­
ministration .officials' express confi­
dence that the forces now under
Gen. Funston's command will *be able
to protect the border in such task'"a

iSan Antonio, Texas, May 15.—Ma­
jor Gen. Frederick Funston and his

Barnum, worked out many details to­
day of the plan of reorganization of
the border patrol, while reports from
Gen. Pershing and from the Big Bend
district served to emphasize how In­
cidental the American operations
south of the border have become.
Gen. Pershing's troops drew closer
together and gave no signs that the
early resumption of the chase for Vil­
la was contemplated.
Col. Sibley is driving his little com­
mand of cavalry, some 60 miles south
of Boquilles, but there is displayed,
