Scott Convinced Mexicans
Washington, D. C, May 1G.
General Scott told Secretary
Baker that the net result of the
border conference was the
convincing of Carranza that the
United States has no other pur
pose in preparation in northern
Mexico than the stamping out
of the brigandage.
There exists an unwritten
understanding that the Carran
cistas shall demonstrate their
ability to handle the situation
before the withdrawal of the
Americans.
General Scott believes that
Obregon is acting in good faith
and that the situation is less
critical from the United States
viewpoint.

IN SESSION
LUST NIGHT
MEETING OF BUSINESS MEN'S
ASSOCIATION AND MEMBERS
OF CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
DEVELOPS "PEP."
The regular meeting of the Husi
ness Men's association last night was
spontaneously converted into one of
the greatest booster meetings of the
year, and while the schedule for rail
road fares and the advertising of
Ardmore was formally adopted, the
general growth of Ardmore, and how
to promote it was the feature of the
meeting.
Members of the Chamber of Com
merce, wholesalers, real estate men,
and private property owners of all
walks of life were present, all there
to see for themselves just what was
"in the air." Such men as Charles
von W'oise, IS. A. Simpson, who was
in Oklahoma City and who sent a
cheering message; Mark Kirkpatrick
men who have made fortunes in the
oil game, were there pledging their
time and money to promote the
growth of the city. The solidity of
"what we have" was the there, and
there was not a word suggestive of
personal aggrandizement.
President Krueger of the Husiness
Men's association, when he saw the
character of the attendance, graceful
ly deferred the business of the asso-
ranks of the town builders, both in
dividually and as an organization.
T. M. Putnam, who was one of the
visitors, was asiveu to mane a speecu.
His remarks had an inspiring effect,
and aroused the closest attention,
;!n the course of his remarks, Mr. Put-
nam told how Oklahoma City began
her growth, and how the first steps
taken were to organize the men who
do things together and practice team
work. He urged a rational plan of
development, which, summed up, is
as follows:
First, what does Ardmore need to
promote it 3 growth?
Second, instill confidence in the
people of getting within a reasonable
period the most important needs.
Third, the constant eifort to get
the necessary things.
"The people of this city as a
whole," said Mr. Putnam, "will rec
ognize in this splendid representation
a body of men who can plan first,
and execute their plans afterward, if
they wiill. They will do their part,
and rally to your support. .My ex
perience in the past teaches me that
WO
must be rational, must first find
.
out the most imperative needs and
