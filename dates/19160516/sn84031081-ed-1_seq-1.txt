the Mexican civil population outside

Purntoga Springs, X. Y., May Ifi.
Two vigorous contests In the gen
era! conference of the Methodist.
Episcopal church were forecast to
night by th" nniKiiini ements that the
committee on episcopacy had voted to
make a supplementary report recom- j
mending u further Increase in liioj
number of new bt'dions to be elected. I
and that the committee on the state
of the church h-ol decided ngalnst
striking from the church require
ments for membership tho prohibition
against theaters, cards and dancing.
Both recomnv nd itions, It was pre
dicted by conference leaders, would
meet with much opposition.
The original report of tho episco
pacy committee today unred the elec
tion of seven new bishops or general
superintendents which would increase
by two tho mcrnltership of the board
of bishops authorized by the general
conference at Minneapolis folir years
ago. It was recommended also that
the the OKbihiana I'plscopal area be
abolished and that new areas be cre
ated at I'ittslmrab, Pu., Detroit,
Mich., and Seoul. Korea. The com
mittee also urged that two missionary
bishops, one of theni a negro, should
be chosen to supervise the work in
Africa, formeijy in charge of Mission
ary Bishops Joseph C. M,irt.cl and
Isaiah B. Scott, who have i.-en re
tired nt their own request.
I'fliale in the conference developed
a sentiment against any increase in
the overhead expense of maintaining
the board of bishops by the Hil.liiion I
of new mi mhers, and favored the es
tablishment of an eppiacopi.il atea at
Singapore t.s well as Seoul. Alter
nearly thro- hours of discussion the
Conference comuiitlee recommitted
th report to the episcopacy committ
tee. A motion to instruct the com
mittee to rvduo" the number of bish
ops by two was voltd down.
The coinmirtee m a rpim-ImI meeting

eral trade commission, was rejected
today by the senate. Senator tlalllu
ger, the republican louder, had op
posed the nominee for flftoun inonlhs

sonally obnoxious" t" him, and the
power of tho senatorial courtesy tra
dition was so groat that he won his
point by a vote of it to S in spite of
a. vigorous and Insistent fitrht by the,
administration for confirmation.
Mr. Bublee, who has been serving:
on the commission Mince soon after
It was created, wilt lose his pout and
draw no salury for his work unless

After the roll cull, which followed
a bitter debate. Senator Mollis of New
