Down By County Officials
Teachers of the Tonopah school dis
trict were surprised today when they
presented their checks at the To
nopah Banking Corporation to find
there were no funds and that the
checks were worthless even as col
lateral for loans. ,
The trustees put the responsibility
up to the district attorney who advis
ed the county commissioners not to
assent to the resolution of the trus
tees asking for an additional levy fbi
the purpose of defraying the current
expense of the schools. (,
The law Ms plain ana there is no
reason why any attorney should have
advised the county commissioners to
reject the resolution. The statutes
are mandatory and the trustees will at
noe mandamus the county to com
pel the levy legally requested. 'At
torney William Fornian has been re
tained by the schools. '
This is another case of the notorious
lack of ability shown by the board
of county commissioners and it Is
urged that while filing mandamus pro
ceedings that a recall be at once in
stituted. Make a clean sweep when
