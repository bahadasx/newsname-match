BLEASE DELEGATES
WILL HOLD CAUCUS
To Meet in Columbia on Ere of State
(Convention and Make dominations.
^ News and Courier.
p Columbia, May 13.?Tne jaiease
delegates in the State convention will
meet in caucus in Columbia on TuesI
day night preceding the convention
for the purpose of selecting nominations
for the various offices to be filled
by the convention and to pass on
the platform of their candidate for
. governor. The name of Gen. Willie
Jones, of Columbia, will be proposed
for State chairman, and candidates
wil also be presnted for president
and other positions which will be
filled.
Th?s information was obtained here
today from authoritative, sources.
The caucus will be called at a designated
place and this faction will consider
plans for the approaching campaign.
t (Among other nominations to be
>y presented by this caucus to the convention
will be the Democratic national
committeeman from this State
for the place now held by United
' States Senator B. R. Tillman, but they
want- someone whom they do not con
l ?ider partisan. For the same reason
tfcey will presnt Gen. Willie Jones
K for State chairman, as they do not
F want John Gary ^"s.
It Is not likely that the Blease men
^will ma"ke any nominations for delegates
to the matronal convention.
Seventy or Eighty.
The best Information obtainable is
i that there are between seventy and
eighty Blease delegates among the
k membership of the State contention.
it is thousfctb .thai ?Solicitor Cooper
-will have about the same number,
A and if tills is the case thej, Manningites
-will fall short of a majority. HowPi^
?ver, another estimate gives Governor
Manning over 200 of the 338 deleW
gates, which would insure his control
I ' (Of the convention. If .the Cooper and
Blease delegations combined control
there may be some surprises in the
f positions to be filled.
State Chairman John Gary Evans
null be nominated for reelection, and
"Tr-ill Can o fnr Tillman WllOn /"IPTI

*^Wilie Jones is nominated against
1 Governor Evans and some man is
placed in nomination then the stand
of the convention on the issue will
B T)e made straight between Blease and
anti-Blease, the latter will control.

* State Chairman Evans will make the
proceedings of the convention interesting.
Undoubtedly the Blease followers
will also oppose Representative
T. P. Cothran and W. P. Pollock
Tor president of the convention. If
banning does not have a majority
then the Cooper contingent will decide
the issue by whichever way they
Tote.
^ McLanriifs Flan,
It looks as if the request of the
I warehousemen for an hour to be allowed
to Senator John L. McLaurin at
^ each of the campaign meetings is
Ha doomed. Former Governor Cole. L.
I V Blease stated today in response to a
^direct question that he was opposed
%to allowing any man to speak who
i was not a candidate, and he favored
this rule being followed strictly. He
did not call Senator McLaurin by
V name, but stated emphatically that
lie was opposed to any such request,
A ?nd said his influence would be
against it. If the Blease caucus goes
against this request from the ware?
* ai?a xn :ii j
FHousemen?ana tnai tuey win uo so
is quite likely?it is not thought there
will be very much fighting over this
proposition in the conVenton, which
would mean that Senator McLauria
would he forced to run for lieutenant
governor if he wants to speak and
have only the same time allowed the
other lieutenant gubernatorial candidates.
Former Governor Blease said if
anybody other than a regular candidate
wants to speak at the campaign
meetings he didn't see why they
wouldn't do so before or after the
meetings were over.
Another intersting bit of informal^pn
leaked out here today regarding
JPr the recent caucus of the warehouses'
men in the State system which, it
^ill be remembered, was behind close
[ doors. This wat? that the caucus
stood: Manning, 50; Blease, 43; Cooper,
4; neutral, 4. It was stated that
as between Manning and Blease the
four neutral and the four Cooper
would go to Blease, making the warehousemen?Manning,
50; Blease, 51?
a majority of one for the former governor.
This poll was made by one
who attended the conference.
GENERAL JOES
NOT CANDIDATE
The State, 15th.
When Gen. Wilie Jones was asked
yesterday if he would be a candidate
for State chairman of the Democratic
committee M replied that 'V-o such
idea had been in his mind," that "in
no circumstances could he serve the
parly in thatx capacity." He added
that "for 14 years he was State chairman,
during which liis endeavor was
to give the party the best that was in
him, but that his private affairs would
not permit him to think of undertaking
the work again, much as lie ap*
A n - ^ Ktr
preciatea rue conautuce jmpucu u, .
the suggestia of his name for the
post."
*Gen. Jones is popular in every part
of the State and without doubt he
would have commanded strength in
the convention had 'he allowed his
irame to go before it, but the suggestion
was without his knowledge, much
the less his encouragemnt.

THE WHITMIRT FIRE
MORE IN DETAIL
Friday morning the news was
flashed over the telephone wires to
Newberry that the business section, of
Whitmire had been wiped out by fire.
This hydra-headed demon of destruc
tion roared ana ronea ana ncKea us
devouring tongues of flaming red and
blue until every store but two in the
little town had been swallowed up.
The labor and progress of years were
soon reduced to worthless ashes and
now a barren, wind swept spot, in the
heart of a cluster of beautiful resi- j
dences is all that is /left of a live j
and progressive business community j
with the exception of only two stores
and the hotel and the bank. Of course
the Glenn-Lowry cotton mill was too
distant to be in the path of the flames
Dut a Dig store oeionging 10 we mm
company was totally destroyed.
The fire originated in the livery
stables of P. B. Odell, about five J
o'clock in the morning. It is pre- j
sumed that a negro feeding Mr.
Odell's stock must have dropped a
smouldering match among the hay or
rubbish in the stables and was soon
developed into an uncontrollable
blaze. Mr. Odell lost all of his food
and a fine $200.00 horse which he had
only recently purchased. He had no
insurance.
The flames spread rapidly and consumed
the general merchandise establishment
of the J. G. Setzler Co.,
the picture studio, the theatre building,
belonging to W. H. Rasor, Dr. J,
H. Moore's office, the Racket Store,
Miller Bros. Hardware and Grocery
store, Miller Bros. Dry Goods store,
the postoffice, the Glenn-Lowry Manufacturing
Co. store, C. H. Cooper's
general merchandise store, G. W. Bullard's
grocery store,. W. J. Hackman's
barber shop, J. G. Holder's pool room,
Bullards grocery, J. P. Bishop's
wood shop, G. C. Ballard's shoe shop,
J. T. Young's livery stables, the
Boyce blacksmith and repair shop,
P. B. Odell's undertaking establishment
and some minor buildings in
the same block.
The Glenn-Lowry fire company together
with the bucket bridage fought
hard and courageously but owing to
tl?e dryness of the weather and the
wooden structure of most of the
buildings in the path of the flames,
it was impossible to save any of the
buildings at all.
The estimated loss in buildings anil
stocks of goods, not counting insurance,
is placed at from $200,000 to
$250,00.
Whitmire is siiuated about midway
between Newberry and Union?IS
miles?and about the same distance
from Cliaton and hence is the trade
centre of a wide radius for a prosperous
and progressive farming section.
Surrounded by such natural advantages
Whitmire will spring at
once from the ashes of 'her ruin and
instead of wooden buildings there
will rise modern structures of brick
and granite that will make of "this
lovely little city among the hills, the
envy of all her sister immunities.
WILL DELAY ACTION
AGAINST BLOCKADE
United States to Hold Up Protest Because
of German Threat-Berlin's
Demands Complicate Case.
I
Washington. IMJay 12.?America's
next step in the negotiations with the
entente allies regarding treatment of
neutral commerce will be delayed oa
account of the implied thread contained
in the German note of May 5,
in which the imperial government expressed
confidence that in view of the
new orders issued for submarine warfp/*e,
the United States would insist
upon Great Britain observing the
rules ,of international law ia dealing
with trade and reserving to itself
"complete liberty of decision" unless
this end was accomplished.
It was stated authoritatively today
that Germany's note had complicated
the situation, making it impossible
for the United States to press its de'
upon the allies at once without
appearing to do so at the bidding
of the 'Berlin government and consequently
it was uncertain when a
reply would go forth to the latest
British communication.

At this time when our country is
facing such momentus crisisfi when

its folds to our balmy Southern
breezes, as it rises to the top of
our school buildings, greeted by the
admiring shouts of young America?
the hope of our nation? Devotion and

afternoon at 6:30, the exercises'
incident to its raising will be held
