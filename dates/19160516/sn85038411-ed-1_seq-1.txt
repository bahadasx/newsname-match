Irish Girl Tells of Events
After Landing at
Tralee

By Associated Press
London, May 16. —For hours this J
morning crowds of people stood in .
line around Bow street police station |
waiting for the resumption of the ar- i
l-aignment of Sir Roger Casement on
charges of high treason in connection :
With the Sinn Fein rebellion.
The little courtroom was crowded I
within five minutes after the doors
were opened and many hundreds of ;
men and women were unable to obtain j
admission. Superintendent Quinn, of j
Scotland Yard, who is in charge of the
police arrangements, voiced the pop
ular feeling about the hearing when j
he said:
"1 have followed every notable case ]
that Bow street has known in many |
years, but the court has never been i
the scene of an examination so full of !
dramatic interest as the present one. j
The tense state of public feeling due ;
to the war has, of course, been a
factor, but the case in itself has lea
tures which raise it far above the level
of any criminal hearing in my memory.
May Go On Stand
There was some speculation to-day
is to whether Casement's lawjers
would place him on the stand at this
preliminary hearing. It is generally j
believed that this will not be done, i
His lawyers refuse to state whether !
they will consider such a step.
The first witness of the day vias
Mary Gorman, a typical Irish girl, who
was the first witness to identify Case
ment as one of the men who landed
from the German submarine at Tralee.
She testified she saw three men pass
ing a farm yard gate early Good Fri
day morning. She was asked by H.
Bodkin, for the prosecution, whether
she could identify any of the three I
men. She replied: "Yes, sir," and
pointed to Casement. The prisoner
bowed his head and scribbled more
diligently than ever on the pad of
paper.
Casement at Ease
Among the spectators were Michael
Flavin, Nationalist member of the
House of Commons, whose home is at
« Tralee, and a number of friends of
Casement, including several women.
Casement appeared to be entirely at
ease and smiled cheerfully as he took
his place in the dock. Daniel J. Baiiey,
who Is accused jointly with Casement, I
apparently was more composed than i
he was yesterday.
As the first witness took the stand j
Casement began to take voluminous
notes. The testimony in the early '
part of to-day's session had to do with j
events in which the two prisoners are
charged with having played a part
after their landing at Tralee, whereas
the evidence given yesterday dealt al
most entirely with operations of Case
ment and Bailey in Germany.
John McCarthy, a farmer of Curra
hane, County Kerry, told of finding
the collapsible boat in which Case- j
ment. Bailey and a man named Mon- :
tfith, who is still at large, landed at '
Tralee. McCarthy said he pulled it
nshore and found a dagger and a tin
box On the way home he met his j
children, who were playing with three '
revolvers they had found near the!
shore.
Other witnesses from the same dis- i
trict told of having seen signal lights !

Akron, Ohio. May 16.—State and

I searching inquiry Into the collapse of
it he Crystal restaurant here last night
In which nine persons were killed and
-8 injured, two probably fatally. The
restaurant was crowded when it was

any more bodies and all of the missing
I have been accounted for. None of the

Boy and His Goat Are
Swallowed by Old Mine
Shenandoah, Pa., May 16.—While
Joseph Chublin, 5 years old, was play
ins with a goat in the Stanton colliery
timber yard last evening the surface
caved into the old workings, carrying
lioy and goat into the mines and bury
ing them alive.
Rescuers set to work immediately
and attempted to lower each other
with ropes into the cavity to recover
the boy's body, but on account of the
surface still "working" had to abandon
it, fearful of being buried alive also.
Community High School
on West Shore Likely
School directors of PJast Pennsboro
township, Shiremanstown, Camp Hill,
New Cumberland. Lemoyne, Worm
leysburg and West Fairview will meet
this evening in the Lemoyne Trust
Company building at Lemoyne to dis
cuss the possibility and advisability of
erecting a community high school at
some convenient point along the West
Shore.
The movement was started a few
years ago and recently it has taken on
a new interest. The destruction of the
building at Enola by fire a few weeks
ago is believed to have hastened the
present movement. A new building will
be needed at Enom and it is under
stood that a number of the directors
along the West Shore are in favor of
erecting a smaller building than that
destroyed by tire. In addition they
are desirous of having a community
building erected in which high school
courses can be taught.

Washington, May 16. American

similar to that at Glenn Springs, ad
