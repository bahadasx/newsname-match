I PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION
OF SIR ROGER CASEMENT
On Charge of High Treason Accused
Busied Himself Taking Notes.
London. May 15. 8.20 p. m. The
writing of a new. chaper of the his- I
tory of the Sinn Fein Rebellion was
begun today when Sir Roger Case
ment, knighted in 1911 for services to
the British government, and Daniel
Julian Bailey, an Irish private boI
dier, one of his- companions on the ill-
fated submarine trip from Germany
to Ireland, were placed in the -dock of
the Bow Street police court for pre
liminary examination on the charge
of high treason. While considerable
testimony introduced by the .-; crown
tended to Incriminate Bailey, the main
attack of the prosecution was direct -
ed against Casement in an endeavM
to enmesh him in a net of evidence
which would establish without ques
tion the leading part it is claimed he
piayeq m the conspiracy, whose ram
ifications extended even to America.
" - Made a Striking Figure. :
Casement himself was the center of
all eyes during the day. It was evi
dent that no ordinary prisoner was
oetore tire bar. tor. despite the - un-
made a striking figure, with neatly
irunmea oeara ana nair orusnea wen
back from a high forehead. under'
neath which were the deep set eyes of
the dreamer. Casement busied him
self taking notes, indicating that he
intended to have a hand in the con
duction of his defense. . He was al
ways self-possessed, and as the case
wore on, began to display considerable
self-assurance.
Few Thrills in Testimony.
The testimony today developed tew
thrills, the prosecution devoting its
attention to showing how Casement
carried on the alleged routing for his
Irish brigade in Germany prison
camps. The most dramatic part of the
whole proceedings was the address
delivered by the attorney general. Sir
Frederick E. Smith, who outlined Sir I
Roger" Casement's former services to
his country, told of the honor bestow
ed upon the prisoner by his king and
then shifted abruptly to the details of I
the conspiracy hatched In Germany.
It was during his address that the
attorney general Introduced a lettei
written by Casement thanking Sir Ed
ward Grey, the British secretary of
foreign affairs for the knighthood con
ferred upon him in recognition of his
Putumayo services. . In this letter
Casement said, '1 am indeed grateful
to you for this singular assurance of
your personal interest. I am very
deeply sensible of the honor done me
by Ills Mnjesty, and would beg that
my humble duty may be presented to I
His Majesty when you can do me the
honor of conveying to him my -deep J
appreciation or the "honor that he has
been so graciously pleased to confer I
upon me.
Flag Brought From Germany.
The attorney general introduced an
other striking feature, when he paus
ed in his speech to produce in court
the flag which it is asserted Casement-and
his companions brought
from Germany to Ireland. . This was
the emblem of the revolt a green flag
with a yellow castle on it, and under
the castle the motto "Urbs antlqua
fuit studiisque asperima belli.
Little Attempt at Cross-Examination.
Casement's attorneys made little at
tempt with crossxamination today,
but several times questioned the wit
nesses as to why Casement wished
that they join the Irish brigade. The
point of the question seemed to be to
show that the freedom of Ireland was I
the only thing involved and the brl- I
gade was not to attempt to assist
Germany. Further testimony will be
introduced by the crown tomorrow.

TURNED DOWN GEORGE RUBLEE
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE.
FED. TRADE COMMISSION
Republican Leader -Gilfinger Stated
That Rublee Was Personally Ob
noxious to Him Bitter Debate Pre
ceded Roll Call.
"Washington. May 16. The nomina
tion of George Rublee of New Hamp
shire as a member of the federal trade
commission was rejected today by the
senate. Senator Gallinger, the repub
lican leader, had opposed the nominee
for 15 months on the ground that he
was "personally obnoxious" to him.
and the power of the senatorial cour
tesy tradition was so great that he
won his point by a vote of 42 to 36 in
spite of a vigorous and insistent fight
by the administration for confirmation.
Will Draw' No Salary.
J Mr. Rublee, who has been serving on
the commission since soon after it was
created, will lose his post and draw no
salary for his work unless the sen
ate's action is reconsidered. Five re
publicans voted for his confirmation
and 14 democrats voted against it.
May "Move for Reconsideration.
After the roll call, -which followed
bitter debate, Senator Hollis of New
Hampshire, wfao led the fight for
Rublee, changed bis vote in order to
move for a reconsideration. This may
be done at another executive session in
the near future.
La Follette Assailed Gallinger's Posi
tion. V
The fight in today's session reached
a climax when Senator La Follette as
sailed Senator Gallinger's position, de
claring that this was the first time
since he had been in the senate that
the "personally obnoxious" rule had
been applied without, adequate proof,
and also the first time it had been ap
plied against a national appointment.
The Wisconsin senator insisted that
Rublee, although he had opposed Sen
ator Gallinger in politics," had not con
ducted himself obnoxiously, and in fact
mat Ms opposition has been gentle
manly. He cited a case where he him
self several years ago had invoked the
personally obnoxious rule against a
Wisconsin nominee for a consular post
at Hong Kong and had submitted
proofs to a senate committee and re
called that, notwithstanding this. Sen
ator Gallinger had voted to confirm
the nominee.
Caustic remarks by Senator La Fol
lette aroused the New Hampshire sen
ator and a bitter exchange followed.
Senator Hollis and others made strong
pleas for -Rublee, maintaining that he
was an able public servant and inval
uable to the commission. . Republicans
who voted for confirmation were Clapp,
Kenyon, La Follette, Norris and Poin
dexter. r
- Democrats who voted against con
firmation were Bankhead, Broussard,
Chamberlain, Clarke of Arkansas,
Hardwlck, M?rtin, Martine, 0"Gorman,
Reed, Saulsh try, Smith of Georgia,
Smith of So) th Carolina, Underwood
and Vardam L -Rub
a Progressive.
Mr. Rublee1 as a ' progressive was
first nominated to the trade commis
sion for a term of three years ' by
President Wilson in February, 1915.
Senator Gallinger at once opposed him
and a tearing was held by a sub-committee
"of tine- interstate commerce
committee. The committee eventually
reported the nomination favorably, but
a vote in the senate was withheld un
til congress had adjourned. . Then the
president gave Mr. Rublee a recess
appointment, returning -his nomination
to the senate in December. -
At the conclusion of .the fight Sen
ator - Hollis moved that the vote be
made public and Senator La Follette
moved as an amendment that the en
tire proceedings be divulged. The Hol
lis motion was agreed to unanimously,
but without the amendment.

BRANDIES' NOMINATION TO
BE FOUGHT OUT IN SENATE
Intimated That a Favorable Report
, Could Not Be. Agreed Upon. .- -
Washington. May 15. It now ap
pears virtually certain the issue over
the nomination of 'Louis D. Brandeis
to the supreme court of the United
States is to be fought out in the
senate without recommendation from
the judiciary committee which has
considered and investigated the case
for more than three months
Although no authoritative announce
ment has been made regarding the
attitude of the judiciary committee it
I was .reDorted after a protracted se-
cret session of the committee toaay
that a favorable report on the nomin
ation could not be agreed upon and
that several democratic senators wno
did not wish to vote for such a report
would support a motion to return the
nomination to the senate without rec-
I ommendatlon.
One democratic mem
ber of the committee who has been
wavering in his attitude toward Bran
deis told a republican colleague that
the committee would report the nomin
ation without approval or disapprov
al, probably next Wednesday. Anoth
er majority senator, who is strongly
in favor of Mr. Brandeis, said he
did not favor such a course but that
j he might be persuaded to support it
rather than nazara tne innuence wmcu
an adverse, report might have on the
senate.

crease of 6.4 Per Cent. i

C" L. Bardo, general manager of thl

railroad to the clerks of the company. J
who threaten to go on strike Wednes-1
day, asking them to accept a wae-ej
increase of 6.4 per cent, was made!

jected the offer of a 6.4 per cent, warai
increase, as well as an earlier one of;
five per cent. , .

the form of a letter to each clerk. The
letter says that the 9,000 members of
the mechanical department of the New

average paid Neww Haven railroad!
clerks, the letter says, is higher thani

"A warning is given that if tVe
clerks go out In response to a str:'--i
order the company must and will ft; l
your place."
