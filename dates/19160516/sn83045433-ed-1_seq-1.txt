their own lives.
Then suddenly out of the tense silence
rang a woman's cry or agony. A figure,
bleeding from cuts on her face, her hair

SCHOOLS OF CRIME MYTH,

Chicago, May 15.-Warden Thomas H.
Osborne, of Sing Sing, today character
ized "schools of crime" in State prisons
as a popular illusion. le denied that the
seasoned criminal was prone to teach the
boy or youth how to dynamite safes and
play the train robber role while they are
thrown together in the reformatory. Mr.
Osborne, who came to Chicago to address
women's organizations on p19on reform,
said:
"There may be such a thing as boys
learning from other boys in a reforma
tory, but there is no school of crime,
strictly speaking. in the larger State
prisons," said Mr. Osborne. "Did you
ever hear an inveterate old smoker ad
vise a young man to smoke? I didn't.
It's the same way with crime. The old
timer would rather warn the young fel
low to 'keep out of the game. He knows
there is nothing in it."
