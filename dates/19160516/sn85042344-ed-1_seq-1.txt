OIB15STOWN, N. J., May 15. At
least 14 men were killed and about
thirty injured today In a terrific ex
plosion at the Itepanno plant of the
Du Pont Towder company near here.
The blast occurred In the building in
which trinitrotoluol is manufactured
und wrecked that structure and
three others. Tho identified dead:
W. F. Uiwley, Woodbury, N. J., as-
Bistant superintendent ot the trinitro
toluol plant.

Frederick Ream, Gihbstown.

Frank nuiuberni.
The cause of the explosion is not
known and. according to officials of
the company, may never be ascer
tained, us all those believed to have
been in the building where the first
explosion occurred uro dead.
Trinitrotoluol is not considered an
explosive risk und company officials
1 elieve It caught fire betoie exploding.
This bias caused a nearby building, in
which nitrobenzol Is manufactured, to
blow up. So great was the force that
to buildings some distance away In
which huxite was manufactured wcim
wrecked, but the explosives did not go
off
Many of those killed and injured
were outside the buildings Involved
mid were either killed or nurt by fly
ing debris, other workmen promptly
went to the rescue anl ambulance
calls were :eiit in to various surround
ing towns. The wildest rumors pre
vailed as to the number of dead, but
the company was unable to give the
number killed until ull the employes
had been cheeked up.
Trinitrotoluol and nitrubenzol nro
used In filling shells and mines. Tho
building in which they were produce!
was of frame construction.

They Can Sell.
THREK new members of the
Tulsa school hoard will bo elect
ed at a special election today. A prop
osition for an extra levy to meet cur
rent school expenses will also be

usually heavy vote probably will bo
recorded.
There are two candidates for each
place. Voters who desire to place the
school board above the ban of sus
picion should see that men of ability
und standing tire elected; they should
be men who are not in any way con
nected with any branch of the con
struction business and who cannot
possibly have anything to sell.
