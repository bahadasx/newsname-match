Judi;e Walter A. Funk in ein uit
court Tuesday granted a temporary
injunction enjoining the j;tney bus
operators from seekinc pissenuers
for hire in front of the property
ovvr.t d by the American Trust Co.
JudKe Funk held that the rights
of abutting property owners were
much more deiinite as provided in
the Indiana statutes than they were
in id her states, subject to certain
easements for the convenience of the
traveling public. "Just as it was
decided in this court tnre-. months

se 1 Rb-w Co. that any navigible river
L publu- highway and that abutting

highway and the abutting owners
are entitled to the same rights," said
Judge Funk.
Attorneys for the jitney i.ns oper
ands immediately gave notice that
they would appeal the case and
make it a test case. As a tempotury
injunction will be regarded by the
higher court as an emergency mat
ter the case will be reviewed there
