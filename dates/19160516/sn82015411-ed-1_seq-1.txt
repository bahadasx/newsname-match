while lion. J. II, Coney secured
two for SI 85. The buildings pur
chased by Mr. Coney were the
warehouses formerly occupied b

ownership ot which is still is dis
pute
All of the parties probably made
bargains, despite the fact that the
buildings were old. for the reason
that lumber of any kind is very
high just now.
1 he buildings were sold on
account of the decision of the gov
eminent to abandon Anahola per
inanently as a landing place.

valuable appliance recently intro
duced on Kauai.
The unto boy w a s cleaning
machine at the time of the acci
dent. He was holding a tin of
gasoline in one hand and was
washing the engine with the other,
when friction o r short circuit
started the blaze. The boy tried
to throw the tin of gasoline out of
the window, and that scattered
the fire over the floor.
The car was quickly run out

of the Pvrene Fire Extinguishers,

Chamber of Commerce, which ex
plains the whole matter:
I expect to arrive in Lihue on
Friday morning, the PHh. You
probably have sten by the news
papers that this Chamber will
make an effort to attract residents
of the other islands to our Kame
haineha Day festivities on June
10. 11 and 12.
My object in coming to Lihue is
to see if I cannot interest the peo

pleased indeed if opportunity were
given me to say something along
the lines of our entertainment to a
meeting of vour member? either
