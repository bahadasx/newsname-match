American Force to Stay Un

Themselves Able-to Cope
With Bandits Situation
Less Critical, is Belief,
.Washington, May 16-The
; result of the Conference at El
Paso, reported .today by Major
1 General Scott to Secretary Bak
jer has teen to convince the
I Carranza government that the
j United Stateshas no pther pur
pose in its operations in north
iern Mexico than to stamp out
i brigandage and as a conse
nt quence there exists substanti-
ally an unwritten understand
ing that the Carranza forces
j shall demonstrate their ability
I to handle the situation as the
i necessary first step toward
jwithdrawal of the American
(punitive expedition.
General Scott believes Gen
eral Obregon is acting in good
faith and that the border situa
tion is less critical today so far
as the American government is
concerned. 1 '.-
General Obr.egori has agreed- to oe-
fcupy and police the Parral " district.
scouring the mountainous regions to
the west of -that town in search of the
remnants of Villa's -followers. He also
agreed to ' establish a strong- patrol
line along the Mexican side of the Big
Bend country. ) -N ' " I '
Pnr tTtat nurnose General Obregon
has ordered into those regidtas ' 10,000
troops: under General Trevino. , -An- :
other element was cleared up by Gen
eral Obregon's- agreement not to bring
the large force of Carranza troops in
Sonora through - Pulpit Pass in Gen
eral Pershing's rear. i
On r their side, ' General Scott - and
General Funston assured General Ob
regon that precautions would be taken
by American commanders not to dis
pose their forces so as to embarrass
the operations of the Mexican, troops.
As to Villa himself, neither American
nor Mexican officials seem to have.
any knowledge . of his "present where
abouts. General Obregon believes him dead.
General Scott reported that the state-
4 that connection was merely an ex
pression ofNopinlon. x
The first v obstacle encountered by
the American conferees at El Paso
was the Necessity of convincing Gen
eral Obregon that the expedition after
Villa was not an intervention step.
Mexican officials pointed out to Gen
eral Scott that It was not customary
ifor posses in pursuit of one man to go
with field guns and mounted artillery
The American officers finally suc-
, ceeded in, persuading the war minis-
Ite. however, that the United States
government had no intention other
Khan its announced purpose. The un
derstanding as to what steps would be
taken by both military . commanders
followed,
A "new plan for patrolling of the
border has been recommended by
General Funston. He proposed N a
corpse of ' 6 8 motorcycles. Secretary
Baker said today he would probably
approve the plan. General Funston
win make El Paso the base of opera
tions for the motorcycle scouts. .

j killed during the engagement at Ojo

dead -in his room since Monday.
Disorganized conditions of the hotel

usual circumstance. There.-- had been
a strike Of chambermaids, and it is
reported that there was a shortage of

arrive home, relatives here telephoned
and telegraphed to the hotel, and re-,
ceived the information that he was
registered, but not in the hotel.

cse authorities, disclosed as the cause
of death, acute dilation of the heart.
Mr. Lennon was widely known in
commercial circles, and was prominent
in the Elks. -

-wife,,, last Thursday, points out ex
tenuating circumstances for the young
wife's conduct, stating that the cir
cumstances are such as to greatly
qualify the character of her. act. ' '
He finds that the young matron was
suffering from "dfesperation and great
mental ! anguish." He points out that
it is his duty; under the circumstances,
to orderfthe young woman held for the
criminal authorities to proceed with
examination and decision. '
The coroner's investigation 'has dis
closed that Mrs. Pa-pp after five years
of very happy married life, found her
self many miles from her kindred in
a strange land and apparently fast los
ing the affections of her husband. He
had squandered their life savings. She
is about to become a mother. In the
utter desolation that to her disordered
mind appeared about to envelop her,
she decided to end her own life. Then
having bought a revolver and pre
pared to kill herself she decided to
kill her husband also.
The coroner's investigation discloses
that the Papps . met and were mar
ried in Welland, Canada, five years
ago. Mrs. Papp's father, opposed the
match. , Against his wishes Mary mar
ried and lived very happily with her
husband. They both ; worked and
saved and had built a house.
About a year ago the first cloud
came in their, married life when their
first born ,a child of three. Was burned
to death. Then Papp decided to come
to . Bridgeport. , He received about
$1,000 for his equity in the house
tley had built in Welland. He was to
have depgsited this in a savings bank
in Bridgeport. Instead it appears he
kept the money about him and began
to squander it in drinking and gam
bling with evil companions.
He began to neglect his wife and
turned a deaf ear to her pleadings
to reform. As a last resort to keep
her husband she got employment in
the same factory and in the same
room with him at the Bridgeport Met
al Goods Co. factory. Her appear
ance there the coroner finds was oc

was exercising. She pleaded with

Irish Lad on Stand Tells
of Driving Casement
Through Country As

Weeps As He Pensi

Boy's Testimony.
Arrested at Point of!
Rifle, Testifies Soldier,
Another Throng;
Jams Little Courtroom
in London Bailey is
Calm During Court
Ordeal.
London, May 16 Sir Rogert
Casement wept in court today
during the second session of his
trial for high treason. j
As a ruddy-faced Irish lad,j
Martin Collins, aged 12 years,
told with pride of driving Case-j
ment a prisoner through thej
countryside, the defendant be-j
ganr writing a statement. What!
he wrote was not known, but
he wept quietly as his pen
scratched over the paper.
The morning session was de-;
voted to the examination of
witnesses who identified Case-i
ment as the man arrested(
near Tralee after the landing
of the German submarine.
Large crowds of people were In line;
early .around Bow street police station,'
waiting for the re-opening of the
trial. The little courtroom was
crowded within five minutes after the '
doors were opened and many nun-1
dreds of men and women were unab?,.'
to obtain admission.' Superintendeu-''
Quinn, of Scotland Yftrd, who is in
charge of the police arrangements.!
voiced the popular feeling about the:
hearing when he said:
"I have followed every notable case j
that Bow street has known in many
years, but the court never has been
the scene of any examination so full
of . dramatic interest as the present
one. The tense state of public f eel
ingsdue to the war has, of course,
been a factor, but the case in' itself
has features which- raise it far above
the level of any criminal hearing in.
my memory." .
There was some speculation today
as to whether Casement's lawyers
would place him i on the stand at this,
preliminary -hearing. It is generally:
believed that this will not be done.;
His lawyers refuse to state whether,
they will consider such a step or not.j
,The (first witness of the day was
Mary Gorman, a typical Irish girl,
who was the first witness, to identify
Casement as one of the men who
landed -from the German submarine
at Tralee. She testified she saw three
men passing a farmyard gate early
Good Friday morning..
She was asked by A. H. Bodkin,
for the prosecution, whether , she
could identify any of the three men.
She replied: ", -
VYes, sir," and pointed io Case
ment. The prisoner, bowed his head
and scribbled diligently on a pad of
paper.
Among the spectators were Michael
Flavin,- Nationalist member of the
House of Commons, whose home is at
Tralee, and a number of friends of
Casement, including several women.
Casement appeared to be entirely at
ease and smiled cheerfully as he took
his place in the dock. Daniel J.
Bailey, who is accused jointly with
Casement, apparently, wasTnore com
posed than he was yesterday.
As the first witness took the stand.
Casement began to make voluminous
notes. The testimony in the early part
of today's session had to do with
events which the ' two prisoners aro
charged with having played a part)
after their landing at Tralee, whereas
the evidence given yesterday dealt al- j
most entirely with operations of Case-!
ment . and Bailey in Germany.
Miss Gorman told the story of meet
ing Casement and his two companions (
on the beach after they landed from j
the submarine.
She talked in a brogue so broad
that It was found necessary to ask her
to write the words before they could
be understood. ' This she did smil
ingly. After- Identifying Casement,
she told how she had seen him later
in the day in the custody of a con- j
stable. She did not recognize Bailey.
At this point the attorney-general,
Sir Frederick Smith, took a hand in
the proceedings. He conducted the
examination of Sergeant John Hearne,
of -the Royal Irish constabulary, who
