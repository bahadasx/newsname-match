Waukegan, 111., May 16. Counsel
for Will H. Orpet, on trial here charg
ed with the murder of his former
sweetheart, Marian Lambert, last
February, today sought to obtain ac
cess to a package of letters written
by Orpet to the girl and found in her
room after the tragedy which cost her
life.
At the opening of court State's At
torney Pady brought into the court
room a black tin box which held more
than sixty missives said to have been
sent by Orpet, the college boy, to his
school girl friend.
Orpet's counsel contended that he
should be permitted to read the let
ters before they were formally placed
in evidence.
Argument over the introduction of
the letters, which are believed to have
a bearing on the events which pre
ceded the death of the girl in the lone
ly grove near her home, interrupted
the examination of veniremen.
The court room was crowded when
the second day of the trial began-.
Bailiffs had obeyed the mandate of
Judge Donnelly and barred children
from the trial.
Orpet sat boside his fathcT and
mother and apparently was absorbed
in the argument of counsel, to which
he gave close attention.

LONDON JAIL
FOR HEARING
Spectators Swarm to Bow
Street Station for Trial
of Casement.
GIRL TELLS STORY
Irish Maiden Gives Testi
mony Regarding Landing
, of Rebel Chief.
London, May 18, (10:51 a. m.) For
hours this morning, crowds waited
around Bow street station for resump
tion of the arraignment of Sir Roger
Casement on charges of high treason
in connection with the Sinn Fein re
bellion. The little court room was
packed five minutes after it opened.
Superintendent Quinn of the Scotland
Yards, in charge of the police arrange
ments, said:
"I have followed every notable case
in Bow street for many years but the
court has never been the scene of an
examination so full of dramatic in
terest" It is generally believed Casement's
lawyers will not place him on the
stand at this preliminary hearing.
Among the spectators were Michael
Flavin, national member of the house
of commons, whose home is at Tralee,
and a number of friends of Casement,
including several women. Casement
appeared to be entirely at ease and
smiled cheerfully as he took his place
in the dock. Daniel J. Bailey, who is
accused jointly with Casement, appar
ently was more composed than he was
yesterday.
As the first witness took the stand
Casement began to take voluminous
notes. The testimony in the early part
of today's session had to do with events
in which the two prisoners are
charged with having played a part
after their landing at Tralee, whereas
the evidence given yesterday dealt al
most entirely with operations of Case
ment and Bailey in Germany.
Farmer Finds Boat.
John McCarthy, a farmer of Curra-
hane, County Kerry, told of finding the
collapsible boat in which Casement,
Bailey and a man named Monteith,
who is still at large, landed at Tralee.
McCarthy said he pulled it ashore and
found a dagger and a tin box. On his
way home he met his children, who
were playing with three revolvers they
had found near the shore.
Other witnesses from the same dis
trict told of having seen signal lights
at sea on the evening before Good Fri
day. Irish Girl Testifies.
The first witness today was Mary
Gorman, a typical Irish girl, who was
the first witness to identify Casement
as one of the men who landed from the
German submarine at Tralee. She
testified she saw three men passing a
farm yard gate early Good Friday
morning. She pointed out Casement
as one of the men. The prisoner bowed
his head and scribbLed diligently on a
pad of paper.
Lends Humor by Brogue.
A touch of humor was added when
Mary Gorman told her story of meet
ing Casement and his two companions
as they were leaving the beach. She
talked in a brogue so broad that it was
necessary to ask her to write the
words before they could be under
stood. This she did smilingly. After
identifying Casement she told how she
had seen him later in the day in the
custody of a constable. She did not
recognize Bailey.
At this point, the attorney-general.
Sir Frederick Smith, took a hand in
the proceedings. He conducted the ex
amination of Sergeant John Hearne of
the Royal Irish constabulary, who was
summoned by McCarthy when he
found the boat It was Sergeant
Hearne who arrested Casement near
Tralee,
Casement Tsed Alias.
The sergeant said that, accompanied
by Sergeant Riley, he searched the
country round and at length found in
the old fort "a man the prisoner in
the dock the tall man Casement"
The sergeant continued:
"I asked him who he was. He said

Great Force
Provided for
in Army Bill
Washington, May 16. Revised fig
ures on the army reorganization bill,
as agreed upon by house and senate
conferees and submitted to the senate
today by Chairman Chamberlain, now
show that the new army will be even
larger than announced when agree-,
ment was reached last Saturday.
Careful analysis shows the maxi
mum strength in time of peace will be
211,000 officers and men, including
25,000 staff troops, Philippine scouts
and nnassigned recruits, and that the
war strength will be 236,500 officers
and combatant troops, which, with
staff troops, scouts, etc., added, will
bring the aggregate maximum
strength of the regular army to 261,
500. The national guard, as reorgan
ized would total 147,000, making a
total of 417,500 available.
Senator Chamberlain told the sen
ate: "For the first time we have provid
ed for an army well balanced through
out and an efficient fighting machine
It provides for troops enough for the
required overseas garrisons and the
remaining troops at home will be such
as will make up complete brigades
and divisions and the regular army
will no longer be a hit and miss col
lection of regiments and battalions."

" Tfonl Measure.
Washington, May 16. To meet
Japan's order regarding the so-called
"gentlemen's agreement" for the re
striction of immigration enacted into
law in the pending immigration bill,
the senate immigration committee to
day agreed upon an amendment which
removes the Japanese entirely from
the bill but accomplishes Asiatic ex
clusion otherwise by a specification of
latitude and longitude which will take
in China, Siberia, India and the islands
of the Malay archipelago with the ex
ception of the Philippines. It leaves
immigration from Japan to be gov
erned entirely by the Root-Takahira
agreement. The change is understood
to be satisfactory to the state depart
ment Representations were made that the
enactment into law of an agreement
which Japan had engaged upon honor
to fulfill was repugnant to the Jap
anese government as was the classi
fication of Jananese with Hindus and
others to be excluded. From the great
block of territory in central Asia the
only country excepted from the
blanket exclusion is Persia. Restric
tion on immigration from Persia is im
posed, however, by a special treaty.
That portion of China along most of
its sea coast is not included in the "ex
cluded" territory but the Chinese ex
clusion laws of this country, it is ex
plained, would be applicable to Chi
nese. EXPRESS COMPANY
DRIVERS ON STRIKE
Chicago, May 16. Express com
panies here faced a strike today when
express drivers refused to take out
their wagons.
It was estimated that more than five
hundred drivers were active in the
strike and that many more through
fear of violence would decline to take
out their wagons.
Police protection for the various ex
press company barns was asked and
details of policemen were sent to the
express company headquarters to pre
serve order.
The strike was called by the presi
dent of the teamster's joint council
who said the cause of the walkout was
the discharge of express drivers who
had joined the wagon drivers' union.
Officials of the company affected by
the strike said that the places of the
men who refused to go to work would
be filled.

Villa has recovered from his
wonnds entirely and has been
busy for some weeks attempting
to raise a new army in the state
of Durango. according to a story
told here today by a Mexican, who
was captured in the engagement
at Ojos Aznles late in April.
Cavalrymen are riding hard on

slain, had clothine indicating that
he possibly participated in the
raid upon Columbus ML
Washington, May IS. The net re-,
suit of the military conference at El
Paso, as reported today by Major Gen
eral Scott to Secretary Baker, has
been to convince the Carranza gov-.
ernment that the United States has no
other purpose in its operations in
northern Mexico than to stamp out;
brigandage, and as a consequence '
there exists substantially an an writ-;
ten understanding that the Carranza '
forces shall endeavor to demonstrate '
their ability to handle the situation ;
as the necessary first step toward ,
withdrawal of the American punitive '
expedition.
General Carranza has agreed to Ma
jor. General Scott's informal under-
standing with General Obregon, which
provides that Carranza forces shall
endeavor to show their ability to con
trol the situation in northern Mexico
while American troops remain for the
time being.
General Scott believes General Ob
regon is acting in good faith and that
the border situation is less critical to
day as far as the American govern
ment is concerned.
Will Protect Border Line.
To carry out his share of the plans
General Obregon has agreed to oc
cupy and police the Parral district,
scouring the mountainous regions to
the west of that town in search of the
remnants of Villa's followers. He
also agreed to establish a strong pa
trol line along the Mexican side of
the Big Bend country to prevent in-
cursions such as that at Glenn Springs
and Boquillas. For that purpose Gen
eral Obregon has ordered into those
regions 10,000 troops under General
Trevino, said to be the most efficient
field commander in the Carranza
army. Advices to the war and state
departments indicate that the move- '
ments are being carried out promptly.
Another important element and one
which American army officers regard
ed as most vital to General Pershing's
line of communications was cleared
up by General Obregon's agreement
not to bring the large force of Car
ranza troops in Sonora through Pul
pit pass into General Pershing's rear.
While the war department is satisfied
of General Pershing's equipment to
care for his force in any circum
stances, the possibility of a large Car
ranza force being moved to his rear
was regarded with some concern.
Assure Obregon.
On their side. General Scott and
General Funston assured General Ob
regon that precautions would be taken
by American commanders not to dis
pose their forces so as to embarrass
the operation of the Mexican troops
and also that the border patrol on the
American side would be strengthened.
As to Villa himself, neither Ameri
can nor Mexican officials seem to have
any knowledge of his present where
abouts, or anything positive to show
