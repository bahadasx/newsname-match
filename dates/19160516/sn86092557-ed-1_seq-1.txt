Read Them; Maybe Your
Own Name is on the
List.
GET All EARLY START
Every One Who Goes in Will
Get a Reward of Some
Kind.
Today for the first time the Hat of
members In the West Virginian "7,000
Club" is made public. This list as
printed below includes all those
whose nominations havo been receiv
ed to date. Some of the members
have voluntarily nominated them
selves, and many others have been
nominated by their friends, who be
lieve they have the ability to win.
Of course out of such a large Ust
of nominees there are bound to be
found some who do not posses suf
ficient ambition or energy to take ad
vantage of the opportunity which their
nomination as members of the "7,000
Club" throws open to them. Others
may remain inactive for more sub
stantial reasons. But there are many
real hustlers included in the member
ship list who can be counted on as
the kind you will hear from later on
with big records.
Look over the list carefully and see
if your name or the name of any of
your friends appears thereon. If
your name is there, 'you should not
hesitate but get busy at once. The
first thing to do is call the attention
of your friends and acquaintances to
the fact that you have been nominat
ed as a member of the "7,000 Club,"
and get them to save all their vote
coupons and subscription for you.
Have them see their friends and lino
them up for your support also. Then
you will have a good start on the road
to winning the Overland Seven-Pas
senger touring car or one of the-oth
er splendid awards offered to active
members of the club. After you have
done this call up the Manager of the
"7,000 Club" or better still drop in and
see him personally. He will' give you
full information regarding the next
steps to take, and show-yon how-you
can conduqt a campaign to get the
most successful results.
If your name does not appear on
the list, it does not mean that ycu are
barred from the race. Thd club iB
still open to all, and if you look up
the nomination blank in this issue

Manhunt With Dogs
Is On at Grafton
{By Associated Press)
GRAFTON, May 16.?Blood hounds
are being brought here today to as
sist local city and state officers in
hunting for two men who killed Wm.
A. Painter and perhaps fatally shot
Wiliam Burton near Elkins yesterday.
The men are reported to have been
in Grafton last night. The suspects
are now under arrest.
Proceedings Today
Before Judge Vincent
The jury in the case of Pittsburg
Provision company against Mrs. Nora
Brown received the case yesterday
evening, in the Intermediate court,
hut at a late hour today had not re
turned a verdict. Taking of the evi
dence in the case of Sam Cornell
against Max Bear occupied the time
of the court today with attorneys H.
8. Lively and J. A. Meredith repre
senting the plaintiff and Harry Shaw
the defendant. Lawrence Holbert
was engaged as court stenographer to
I take the transcirpt of the evidence.
The dispute in this case is over rent
that was not paid, according to the
plaintiff. The case is an appeal from
the court of Squire T. G. Price of Mo
nongah.
An obsolute decree was granted by
Judge Vincent in the chancery divorce
proceedings of Briener against Brien
er. An order was entered filing the
application of Umbarto Sklllise against
John Samorco for an injunction. The
court is considering the granting of
the injunction and wilt announce a
decision later. In the case of B. C.
Coogle against M. B. Barker and W.
J. Bragg, special constable, which was
originally heard before Justice of the
Peace F M. Keener of Winfleld dis
trict, an injunction was granted to the
plaintiff.
Race Case Argument
Goes Over to June
The argument of the motion to set
asldo the verdict in the case of West
Virginia against L. 0. Raco will not
likely be argued until the June term
of Circuit Court. Although the court
is still in'session today a motion to
continue the hearing of the case was
made by the attorneys for the defend
'ant. Unless tho states attorneys make
some serious objections to this pro
cedure the date for the hearing of the
argument will likely be set for early
In the June term. Whether the pres
ent session of the court would be ad
journed today or not Judge Haymond
was unable to determine at a late
hour this afternoon.

State Disease 'Prevention
t Chief Pays Visit to the
City.
Dr. C. R. Welrich, director of the di
vision preventable diseases of tho
state health department, visited Fair
mont lato yesterday and appoared well
pleased with the progress of the work
of disease preventatlon in this city and
county. With the exception of Mor
gantown, Fairmont has the lowest
death rate of any city in West Vir
ginia. This is duo not only to tho
faithful work of the health officials
but in a large measure to the natural
advantages of, tlifc city's location
which makes tho drainage anil sani
tary problems easy of solution. Much
more can bo accomplished, said Dr.
Welrich. if the physicians of the city
and county are more thorough in their
reports and prompter in notifying the
health officers of each case of trans
mlssable disease. At tho present
time but few transmissable diseases
are In progross, only one cae of ty
phoid In the county being reported
and the prlng measles epidemic being
about over.
According to the county health phy
sician, Dr. L. N. Yost, the figures giv
en in the morning paper as being the
number of deaths in Fairmont for the
past year were a mistake, these fig
ures being for the state as a whole
and not for Fairmont. Although Fair
mont now has one of tho best milk
Inspection ordinances In tlio state, yet
because of the lack of sufficient funds
and apparatus tho city health official
Is unable to give this work the amount
of time it deserves. All the barber
shops in Fairmont were notified today
of the new state hoalth regulations
that went into effect April 1 and copies
of the regulations were distributed by
Dr. Yost.
Dr. Welrich after his Inspection trip
about Fairmont praised the work or
the city health physician, Dr. Chesney
Ramage and especially his careful
work In Insuring a safe water supply
for the residents of tho community.
Dr. Yost said that a strict enforcement
of all the sanitary regulation respect
ing campers and persons who live
along the banks of- the rivers would
be In effect this year to prevent all
contamination of the sources of the
water supply.
The practices of campers throwing
refuse and allowing waste matter to
drain Into the river above the places
where the city water supply Is ob
tained, will be prohibited and severo
penalties will be metod out to all vio
lators of the regulations.
The actual number of deathB in Fair
mont last year from all causes was
only 293 and of this number the lar
gest attributed to one cause was 21
which were ascribed to senility or old
age. Accidents of various kinds were
responsible for 17 deaths, Organic
heart disease 16; Typhoid only ten
deaths while scarlet fever and mea
sles caused none. Nine deaths were
attributed to tuberculosis and ll ..to
Infantile Intestinal diseases. Pneu
monia also caused 11 while paralysis
and cancer wero each responsible for
Ave. Various other diseases were the
Immediate cause of the remainder of
the number of deathB although less
than five deaths were ascribed to any
one cause.
By more thorough enforcement of
milk ordnance and ottsr sanitary reg
ulations the city officials could pro
rent many of these causes of death,
according to th? QIC* Board of Health.

CHICAGO, May 16?The c'ommlt
tee in charge of arrangements tor
the Progressive national convention
to be held here next month are
planning to fill in wants which oc
cur between speeches and commit
tee reports with music it was made
known today. Fifty musicians have
been engaged and a number of
grand opera stars are under con
sideration.
Intestinal dlieam'of'cfflfifSffSsBWI!
adults also Are in many cases caused
by contaminated' milkl Uninspected
milk Is also a prolific spreader of ty
phoid infections. Although much has
been done In the past few years to
ward the prevention and transmission
of diseases in Fairmont, yet this city
is stil far behind other progressive
communities in sanitary work. TMb
sort of work while not expensive in
comparison to the results of such .en
deavor Is. nevertheless-unable . to be
carried on without funds or provision
for the enforcement of the regulations
of the health officials. After his in
spection trip about Fairmont Dr. Weir

today in visiting those places.
Pay Increase For
Traction Co. Men
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER
MONTH ADDED TO COMPANY'S
PAY ROLL
Two cents a'hour increase in the!
wages of all employees was announc
ed today by. the.officlils of the ."Monbh

will Increase the local payroll- of t}ie
company more -than $10,000 each]
month. This'is an advance of from!
10 to 15' per cent, for the majority
of the conductors and motormen that

tion that the company has for the,
faithful service of its-men. Although ]
all construction material and equip-1
ment has increased greatly in cost
the company by increased business
and careful elimination'of excessive
overhead expenses has been able to
give the men this increase. Owing

Before an enthusiastic crowd of
about 1,000 "A Midsummer Night's
Dream'" was rendered in . excellent
style last night by the students of tho
?tltaftau UPuijuhI school. -The -evening
was ideal for an out-door play and as
is well known,' Eood -?ark cannot be
improved upon the solitude and sur?
roundings necessary to produce such
a play as Shakespeare's fair^ produc

Pauline Talkington and Mary Gil

daughter of Egeus and Helena, a
beauty in love .with Demetrius, played
their ways into the hearts of the au

training at the hands of Miss Beatrice
Pitzwater, teacher of expression at
the Normal school.
Creed Bolyard as Egeus, Guy. Kuhn j
as Theseus, Russell Smallwood as Ly- i
zander and.George. Hunt as Demetrius
displayed considerable ability. They
were warmly greeted by the audience j
each time they appeared. The fairies,
and' the comedians were finely cos
tumed and well rehearsed.
The play could not have been-im
proved except possibly in respect to
scenery. ' The natural beauty of Loop
Park was pressed into service and
the same foliage had to do for alt acts
and all localities.
The hundreds of ladies and ffJJldren
