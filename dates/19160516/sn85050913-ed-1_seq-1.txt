Track Team Wins Trophy Cup Over
Mason City, Fort Dodge and
Hampton at the Boone
Valley Field Meet.
IS FIRST IN DECLAMATORY
Miss Maud Melvin Secure* a Decis
ive Victory in the Humorous
Glass Saturday.
The annual Field Day and De
clamatory Contest of the Boone Val
ley High School Association was heid
Saturday at Algona, and from the
standpoint of the Webster City
high school the day was a notable
one In every respect. The boys won
the grand loving cup awarded the
schodl scoring the most points in
tlho track meet—the first time in the
history of the association that this
honor has come to the Webster City
school. To crown the day's successes,
Miss Maud Melvin, daughter ot Mr.
and Mrs. J. S. Melvin of this city,
won first honors for her Bchool In
her section of the evening declama
tory contest, the humorous division
The competition in this class was
perhaps the strongest of all three in
the centcst, containing the represen
tatives of Mason City, Eagle Grove
and" Fort Dodge, besides Webster
City. -It is sufficient commentary on
Miss Melvin's work to state that she
received two firsts and one second
from the three judges.
-J^ymsssmiM/k,
tkc attendance viewpoint was marr
ed by a cold, drizzling rain which
continued throughout the day. Blab
orate preparations had been made by
the entertaining city1 and school for
a grand gala day and special trains
were pin from Mason City, Fort
Dodge, Humboldt and Hampton. In
spite of the rain, good-sized delega
tions were present from the various
towns represented, abput fifty mak
ing the journey from Webster City.
The Boone Valley track and field
meet is the most keenly contested
event of its kind conducted in
Northern Iowa, and in past years its
winners tiave made a better showing
at the state meet at Des Moines than
those of any similar organization in
Iowa. Algona had placed at the dis
posal of her guests the excellent
half-mile track of the Kossuth Coun
ty Racing Association, which, but
for the rain, would have been in
superb condition. As it was, the deep
mud made fast work impossible in
the tracks events, especially the dis
tance runs, and in the field events
the uncertain footing prevented any
of the contestants from displaying
their" real caliber. At that, two rec
ords were shattered, Greenwood qf
Webster City hurling the discus for
a throw of 107 feet, 3 inches, and
Muir ot Hampton heaving the shot
over 43 feet, both being the best
marks ever made in Boone Valley
meets.
.Greenwood, as usual, was not
closely pressed in the discus throw,
Leland of Humboldt copping second,
honors, with Muir of Hampton
third. France annexed the other
Webster City points in the field sec
tion. He placed second in the shot
put, and for good measure proceeded
to demonstrate his ability as a pole
vaulter by placing third, much to
the enjoyment of the Webster City
rooters, to whom his prowess in this
line came as a complete surprise.
The hundred yard dash was some
what of a .disappointment to Web
ster City fans, who had hoped that
Gllmore could add another victory
to his past trjumphs in this event.
The water-soaked speedway was too
much of a handicap, however, and
Gllmore'was awarded second, Sulli
van of Eagle Grove winning a hair
breadth decision at the tape.
To John Porter goes the well
earned credit of winning the indi
vidual honors ot the meet, with
10% points. He had things all his
own way tooth in the mile run and
in the half mile. In these Bame
events cane the genuine "dark
horse" surprise of the meet, when
Sweazey of Webster City, running
WWiffHPiMIIIWI'llifM IWfflllWP
his first interscholastic races, plac
ed second in the mile and third in
the half.
The competition was, blose at all
tjmes. Although Webster City was
in the lead from the time of the sec
ond avent of the afternoon, the mile
run, .the margin of safety was never
more than eight points. Fort Dodge
Hampton and Mason City—all
"doped" before the meet, with Web
ster City, as possible championship
winners—struggled fiercely, while
Humboldt, Eagle Grove and Algona
each kept matters interesting by
grabbing much needed points from
'the real contenders, at critical mo
ment^ When finally but two events
remained—the two relay races—
Webster City needed three points to
"cinch" the meet. The team was
tired from the gruelling mud-flound
ering of the long afternoon, but the
men were ready. The first race was
the mile relay. Greenwood led off,
secured a narrow margin over the
nearest runner-up, bugged the in
side track, and maintained his lead
until within a few feet of the sec
ond Webster City runner. Gilmore
and Hill kept the team in the de
sired position—second place—and
Porter jogged home with the needed
three points, and the meet was Web
ster City's.
The trophy cup is a new one this
year, and is donated to the associa
tion by the Commercial Club of Al
gona. It is a magnificent silver
vase, with staghorn handles, stand
ing twenty-four inches from base to
rim. Its possession gctee each year
to the victorious schobl, permanent
possession going to any school able
cession. Only two school* In the
association, Fort Dodge and Hamp
ton, have ever been' able to retain
final ownership of a Boone Valley
trophy.
The records made were not up to
standard, on account ot the miser
able condition of the dirt track, but
in the majority of events they were
better than the cinder path time
made the same day at-the Iowa City
and Grinnell meets, in which Des
Moines, Waterloo, Davenport, Cedar
Rapids, Ottumwa, Iowa City, and
other leading high schools were com
peting.

^^THtf DTCLAM^ORY"CONTEST..
The evening was devoted to the
presentation of medals to the victor
ious athletes, and to the annual de
clamatory contest of the association.
In this event, each school is allowed
one representative, ^the different
speakers being divided into three
classes—oratorical, dramatic, and
humorous-—according to the nature
of the reading. The winner ,of first
place in each class 1b awarded, a gold
medal.1
Miss Maud Melvin, representing
Webster City, read a humorous se
lection entitled "The Patterson
Twins and Jakey." Miss Melvin won
second place in the local contest last
fall, and this was her first appear
ance In interscholastic work. From
beginning to end, her presentation
was of a finished nature which held
the audience completely, her por
trayal of the five varying characters
in the selection being worthy of a
much more experienced speaker. The
decision of the judges, which accord
ed her the gold medal, met with
general .approval, although the rep
resentative from Mason City was a
close second. Eagle Grove and Fort
Dodge finished third and fourth re
spectfully in this division.
Miss Melvin is a Freshman and
has three more years of contest work
before her, which gives much prom
ise for the future.
Miss Melvin's trainer has been
Mrs. D. C. Chase, Jr., and the vic
tory of Saturday evening is one
which also gives much credit to Mrs.
Chase for efficient coaching.
The judges of the declamatory
contest were Supt. E. W. GoctBch of
Spencer, Snpt. O. S. von Krog of Em
metsburg, and Prbf. J. Roy Struble
of Charles City.
School Picnic.
The children of the Pleasant Val
ley school, seven miles north of
town, together with their parents
and friends, enjoyed a delightful' all
4ay picnic on the school grounds
Friday. A picnic dinner was served
at noon, the school furnishing ice
cream and cake. Games, contests,
etc., were the amusements and made
the day a complete success. Miss
Lillian Bateman, who has taught
this school for the past two terms,
has not yfet decided whether or not
she will teach it for\^nother year.
Word has been received by Mr.
and Mrs. C. B. Haldeman stating
that the ten months old baby son of
their daughter, Mrs. C. A. Boyd of
Eldorado, Okla., died recently. Mrs.
Boyd has friends in this vicinity who

T. W. Nees^Wfao Resided South of
This* City, Succumbs to
Tuberculosis.
A dis$atcn was receives ny rela
tives near this city yesterday, an
nouncing the death of T. W. Neese,
who resided a mile and a half south
west of Webster City, which occur
red at Phoenix, Arizona, Sunday
Mr. Neese, in compbny with his wife
and a trained nurse—Miss Ruth
Conklin—left this city four weeks
ago for Phoenix, hoping that the cli
mate might restore him to health,
but the change did not work the de
sired effect.
The deceased has been in poor
health for about one year and last
December was taken much worse. In
January ho was taken to Chicago
wl\ere an operation was performed
in an attempt to save his life. Here
he remained four weeks and was
brought home only to show no im
provement in his condition. Later
he was taken to Arizona but the ef
fort to stay the ravages of 'the dis
ease proved useless. Taberculosis of
the bowels was the direct cause of
his death.
Mr. Neese was about forty-two
years of age. He leaves a wife and
an adopted syi, the latter about fif
teen years old, to mourn his demise.
The remains, accompanied by the
wife and Miss Conklin, will arrive
in this city on Wednesday, having
started on their long journey Sunday
night.
Lecture on "Twilight Sleep."
A lecture on "Twilight Sleep," il
lustrated by the most remarkable
pictures ever shown to any audience,
will be delivered at the Orpheum
Theatre, on the afternoon and even
ing of Thursday, May ISth. Preced
ing the pictures a lecture will be de
livered by Mrs. Erba Robenson.
Arrangements have been made to
show to audiences composed of wom
en %nd men at separate performan
ces, motion pictures Illustrating the
"Twilight Sleep" treatment for ma
ternity at Freiburg. Germany. The
pictures are the same films shown in
the eastern cities in the recent
months by "The Motherhood Soci
ety" and aroused such interest that
that society has arranged for a tour
of leading cities in the west. At
Minneapolis the engagement was ex
tended another week. The pictures
show "twilight" mothers and babies,
illustrating the rationale of the
treatment with no objectionable
features.

Chris Ottosen Here.
v.
Chris Ottosen of Humboldt county
arrived in the city today to renew
old acquaintances and. tqake new
ones. Mr. Ottosen is a candidate for
congress to succeed the Hon. Frank
P. Woods, aad is wsll pleased with
thfc outlook. lie "says the people" of
the district, or many of them, be
lieve it is time to give a new man a
chance and he feels thait this element
is now in the majority. The one
regret that he has, is that he didn't
get into the contest sooner, but he
and his friends were expecting eith
er Senator Larrabee of Fort Dodge
or Senator Chase of this city to be
a candidate. If Mr. Ottosen had
time to make a thorough canvass of
the district there would be no ques
tion of his nomination, is the judg
ment of his friends, many of whom
believe he will win any way.
For Attorney GeneraL
H. M. Havner, of Marengo, Iowa
county, candidate for attorney gen
eral, was here today between trains,
having arrived from the east on the
Central and going south on the
Northwestern. Mr. Havner is one of
the good lawyers of Iowa and is ful
ly capable to fill the position he seeks
in a satisfactory manner. He is
meeting with considerable encour
agement over the state and hopes to
be a winner. The bar of his county
gave him an exceptionally good en
dorsement and it is evident that he
stands high in the estimation of his
lawyer associates.
Death of Former Resident.
Mrs. Geo. S. Jacks has received the
sad news of the death of her broth
er, N. R. Penney, at Salem, Oregon,
who died on the 4th of this month.
Mr. Penney lived in Hamilton coun
ty many years ago, leaving here in
1878 or 1879. He resided upon a
farm in Fremont township ten years
and -was a prominent and well
known citizen who will be kindly
remembered by many of the older
settlers. He leaves three daughters
and a son and three sisters and a
brother.
Thumb Injured in Machine.
Bryce Ringer, an employee of the
Northwestern Felt Shoe factory, re
ceived a serious injury to his thumb
on his right hand Saturday after
noon about 4 o'clock. He was em
ployed at the cutting machine and
in some manner caught his hand,
mashing the end of it badly. He was
taken at once to a physician's office
where the thumb was dressed. The
physician thinks \he end of the bone
is uninjured and that the wound
will heal satisfactorily without
much of a scar.
Mrs. A. J. Bish, who has been ser
iously ill with heart trouble at her
home for the past two weeks, is bet
ter today.
WILL HOLD SPECIAL
MEEK IN TENT
In Court House Park Beginning
June 15th—Rev. W. R.
Cain in Charge.
A special revival meeting, com
mencing June 15th and continuing
ten days, will be held by the Pente
costal Church of the Nazarene, the
services being conducted in a tent in
the court house park each afternoon
and evening.
Rev. W. R. Cain of Wichita, Kan
sas, is to be the evangelist, and Mrs.
Blanch Christianson of Gait, Iowa,
will be in charge of the singing and
music.
This is the second series of meet
ings to be held here by Rev. Cain,
the former one having been conduct
ed in the church last December, the
most thorough work being done at
that time since the organization of
the local church. Great victory is
expected by this church during the
meeting next month. Those who
have heard Rev. Cain say he is a
faithful preacher of God's word and
declares the truth in love and with
no uncertain sound. During the
meetings he will also sing some
special songs, having written both
words and music to some of them
Mrs. Christianson, who will be in
charge of the singing and music, has
had considerable experience in gos
pel singing the last few years, hav
ing had charge of the music and
singing at one meeting held in this
city nearly three years ago. She is
also a member of the local church
Special music, instrumental and vo
cal, will be one of the features of
the meeting.
The object of these services will
be the conversion of sinners, reclam
ation of backsliders and' the entire
sanctlfication Of believers.
It is hoped by both pastor and the
church that many may avail them
selves of this opportunity of hearing
Rev. Cain and thereby be benefitted
by bearing and obeying the truth.
A Phase of Modern Efficiency.
A. & Welch, traveling salesman,
In conference here recently with
Young & Clifton, distributors of
"Certain-teed" products", had this to
say of advertising: "It is a phase
of modern efficiency. It adds to the
buyer's information. He is the one
most benefited. It suggests to him
things of use, comfort, convenience
or pleasure. At a glance he can tell
if the things fit his needs or wishes.
A second glance tells him where they
are to be had. His'time, his efforts
and his money are thus saved. He
is a more efficient buyer. Every
buyer—and everybody is a buyer—
should read informative advertising,
because it pays. Mr. Welch's house,
the General Roofing Mfg. Co., is one
of the large national advertisers.
That It has paid tlum is well evi
denced by the fact that out of every
five rolls of roofing sold, they claim
one is "Certain-teed."

HAMILTON COUNTY
AT.y.
THE TIME.
W. H.
Pioneer Settler of Hamilton County
Passes Away at Age of
Eighty-Seven.
W. H. VanNess, a pioneer settler
of Hamilton county who went to El
reno, Okla., to live four years ago,
died Friday night after a short ill
ness caused from his advanced years
he was eighty-seven. His daugh
ter, Mrs. Z. S. Talcott of Williams,
and son, Ned VanNess, a lawyer in
Algona, were summoned to his bed
side but did not arrive until after he
had passed away.
Mr. VanNess was a well educated
man and lived on a farm in Rose
Grove township for many years. Fol
lowing the death of his wife, many
years ago, he left the farm and made
his home with his daughter, Mrs.
Talcott and family, on another farm
south of Williams. In an early day
Mr. VanNess crossed the plains to
California. At that time there
wasn't a single residence between St.
Joseph, Mo., and Salt Lake City. He
remained in California for about
eight years and at the breaking out
of the civil war enlisted In the Union
army and served faithfully till the
end of the conflict. While in the
service he received a serious wound
on one of his hands. He settled near
Williams some time after the war.
A rare collection of Indian wear
ing apparel, beads, etc., was given
the Kendall Young library by Mr.
Van Ness over ten years ago.^ This
collection, which is .kept in one of
the cases in the children's room at
the library, was made by Mr. Van
Ness in the early days and some of
the articles date back to very early
Indian times.
For many yeatfa. W., H. VanNess
was'One of the l^adirtg'Tnen of the
community iq which he lived. He
was a^t' advanced thinker and active
in all movements for the advance
ment and betterment of bis fellow
men. He was a man of clean char
acter and high ideals and was a liv
ing encyclopaedia of the times and
experiences through which he pass
ed. It was a genuine pleasure to
listen to Mr. VanNess tell of his
journey acrosa the western plains
and to recount the many and varied
experiences he had in the pioneer
days. He was an ideal citizen, fath
er and husband and measured up to
tbe full stature of a man in all the
relations of life. His was a well
spent life and he leaves a record
that Is a precious heritage to those
left to mourn his taking away.
Vcme Baxter, who has been em
ployed at the National sewer pipe
plant, has accepted a position with
City Manager Vollmer, doing survey
ing, some office work, etc.
Mrs. Mary Lyon, who has been
very ill with neuritis and bronchitis
at her home on Boone street for the
past ten days, is very much better
today.
