High School Organization Be
comes Local of American
Federation of Teachers.
HAS AN A. F. OF L CHARTER
Effort Will Be Made to Organize
Grade Teachers as Separate
Looal.
Washington high school teachers, It
became known today, were the first to
apply to the American Federation of
Teachors, for a charter ai a local teach
ers' union.
Announcement was made today of the
granting, by the American Federation
of Labor, of a full-fledged charter to the
American Federation of Teachers, as an
affiliated organisation. This was done
May 10, and a few days later the Wash
ington High School Teachers' Union
applied for a charter as a "Washington
local" in the new organisation.
Tho original plan was to affiliate the
Washington union directly .with the
American Federation of Labor. Within
a week, though, the A. F. of L. has
granted a charter to the American
Federation of Teachers, with national
headquarters at Chicago, and the appli
cation of the high school teachers' union
nas Been forwarded to tho Chicago or
flee of the new federation.
Officers Announced.
Announcement has Just been made of
the officers of the new national organ
isation of school teachers. Charles R
Stllltnan la president, and Miss Margaret
Hnodtrress Is secretary.
L. V. I.nmpson, temporary president
or tne wasningion leacners- union, saia
today that the Washington union will
send delegates to tho Central Labor
union here.
Permanent officers of the High School
Teachers' Union will bo elected at a
meetinr this afternoon at central- Hign
School. No "slate" has been prepared,
Nominations will be from the floor.
101 Have Joined.
Temporary President Lampson said
that 101 high school teachers have been
enrolled In the" union, and mora are
expected today. TJbe, unpn hopes to
have a majority of lhesu jeacheva.of
tne rive wnitq. nign scnoois and normal
school affiliated with It.
Action will ue taken todny looking to
the appointment of a committee to ex
tend co-operation to grade teachers for
the formation of a second union. Thla
wilt be entirely made up of teachers In
the grades. Because their Interests are
different from those of tne nigh scnooi
teachers In many respects It has been
derided to unionize as separate bodies.
The question of pensions for school
teachers la to be one of the main work
ins Dolnts of the high school teachers'
union. At a meeting when a constitu
tion was aaopiea a commmce was
named to work to thla end.

Cabinet Learns of Pledges Given
General Scott by General
Obregon.
SEND GUNBOAT TO TUXPAM
Confirmation of Attack on U. S.
Troops Contained In Official
Dispatches.
General satisfaction was ex
pressed at the Cabinet meeting to
day over the report brought back
to Washington by Major General
Scott, concerning his recent con
ferences on the border with Gen
eral Obregon.
Secretary of War Baker, speak
ing for General Scott, informed
the President that the situation,
both from the standpoint of better
understanding between the two
governments and from the standi
p.'nt of co-operation between the
military forces of each, was better
than it has been at any time since
the Columbus raid.
The Navy Department annovn:
ed today that o gunboat has been
sent from ra Cruz to Tuvosm
in response to an appeal from thd
oi optiators at the-latter poif Ut
bcttr protection.
TO ' WAIT DEVELOPMEN IS
It Is understood to have been tha
opinion of the President and his ad
visers, after hearing the report, jp
await development resulting from,
General Obregon' promise to conduct
a vigorous campaign In the Parral
district and the terrltcry lying- south
nf the Big Dend area of Texas before
resuming diplomatic discussions with
the Carranza government on tho
' lean troops
Iri substance. General Scott's report
was:
That General Obregon came to the
conference with some misgivings
about American Intentions In Mexico.
bJt had gone away convinced that
ending bolder banditry Is the sole
purpose of the expedition.
rhaf Obregon had Agreed to provide
10,000 'of the most controllable Mex
ican soldiers under General Trevino
tn patrol the Pnrral and Big Bsnd
dlstjicts.
That Obregon had agreed the Big
Bend Carranzlstas In Pulpit Pass.
which recently gave army men some
uneasiness, would not move back of
Brigadier General Pershing's line.
That the Carranzlstas would pursue
the Boqulllas and Glenn Spring raid
ers and attempt to deliver the Ameri
can captive, Deemer, safely.
Situation Improves,
Scott Informed the Secretary that
In his. Judgment the situation Is now
better than It haa been for weeks.
For a time, he admitted, the situation
was none too optimistic, but Scott
now believes the situation Is very
good, particularly In view of the Ob
regon pledges, and the fact that Obre
gon now knows fully the American
viewpoint and Intentions.
Nothing In the problem as It now
stands gives the Cabinet cause for
alarm, though certain officials say it
