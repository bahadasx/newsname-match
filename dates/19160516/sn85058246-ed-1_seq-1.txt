B Lyric Wednesday
1 And Thursday
H A llfo as tranquil as a midsummer
H day; a palatial mansion with every
H luxury that a millionaire husband
mm could lavish upon her was Marcla's
mMf lot. Untroubled by any caro and
! wU nurrounded by fashionable, friends
M she entertained upon an cjnborato
H scalo.
MM Gray meanwhile was passing thru
1 very troubled wators financially.
H For Gray was the president of a big
ME trust company and ruin and disgrace
H loomed ahead.
B The crash came as Marcla gavo a
H We dinner.. Gray kept late, arrived
H as tho guests having heard tho ru-
iH mor were hurriedly departing. The
Wm friends of prosperity were fleeing tho
m shadow of disgrace. Gray's arrest
B followed. In this hour of great need
M his wlfo wag the only one who ral-
M lied to his aid. Tho wlfo Becmlugly
iVl deserted by all with homo and for-
'H tuno lost, found that her former
J sweetheart, tho bachelor lawyor Or-
H lando Castlo would gladly gfte aid.
MM Castlo went Gray's bond and agreed
J to defend him, gratis.
BJ Meanwhile the prison conflncment
H wrought a change In Gray and' ho
D camo forth filled with bitterness and
D a growing suspicion of his wife and,
H Castlo. He determined to flee the
country and bought tickets for Mar-
cla nnd himself. In a violent scene
I lie accused the Innocent Castlo and
so offended Marcla that she refused
I to accompany him. Scornfully ho
'departed alone.
Stopping off a small ferry that
n night ho Inquired his way from a
(J loiterer on tho wharf. The drunken
J? loafer was Crano, a ruined depositor
k of tho wrecked trust company.
9& Slowly Into Cranes drink soaked
mind camo recognition. Ills Inflamed
reason formed a horrible revenge.
Tho death Btrugglo was despcrato
and Marcla was lcTt a widow.
Tho seasons passed nnd Marcla's
esteem and regard for tho steadfast
friend who wished to glvo all for her
sako deepened and grew until It was
nil absorbing and of courso tho end-
Dl Ing was happy.
U This great plcturo Is In addition to
I I ho big vaudovlllo attraction.

ACTUAL TILE
LAYING WILL
BEGIN TODAY
Actual tllo laying will begin this
morning on tho land of tho Logan
Lund and Drnlnago Company north
of Collego ward, Just south of tho
College Spur. For tho paBt week -tile
has been laid out along tho lines of
draluago and machinery hns been un
loaded and set up for trenching.
Last evening saw about tho last of
the preparatory work concluded and
thlg morning ought to seo actual
trenching and tllo laying.
Nell Casey, representing tho J. II.
Casoy Contracting Company, of Craw,
fordsvlllo, Indiana, Is In chargo of
tho work. He has a small force of
men on thejob at present but will
likely put qulto a number nioro nt
work as sobn as .somo of tho open
work for teams begins. Operators
are coming from Indiana for tho ma
chlno work.
Tllo will bo laid at nn average
depth of nbout flvo feet over tho en
tire area to bo drained. Tho main
llnea will bo some deeper to conform
to the required grado The tilo will
bo from five to fifteen Inchon '" dl
nmcter, according to the country
drained. The Corlnno Concrete Tile
Company of Brlgham City, Is furnish
"ing tho tile, over fifty miles of which
will be used. Mr. Casey, who Is al
so Interested In a tllo factory In In
diana, states that this material Is
tho best ho has seen and certainly
ought to" prove very successful In
this soil.
Mr. Casey Is using a Sargent ditch
er, inndo by tho Sargent Manufactur
ing Company of Fort Bodge, Iowa, a
ladder type machine that cuts n
trench to perfect grade at required
width. H. W. Sargent Is herq to put
the machine In operation and to run
It for a week or ho until everything
is seen to bo perfectly sntlsfnctojjy.
Both Mr. Sargent and Mr. Cn-jey.
nro greatly Impressed with Cacho
Valley. While tho gentlemen were
epemllng Sunday here, they thought
! it would be n nlco walk to go up to
. tho mountains, und accordingly sot
out. When tho canyon was reached
tlioy thought It would be put a short
climb to the top of tho mountain to
tho north, nnd accordingly set out
without more equipment than their
vlcl kid shoes. They reached the
top nil right and made the return In
duo time, or nvardue time; but not
without considerable loss of ahoo
lenther and energy, such as frequent
ly happens with tho plains peoplo
who come to these valloys. But both
were overjoyed with tho beauty of
tho valley, Mr. Sargent declaring It
to bo the finest ho has seen in all
tho west. The vlow from tho moun
tain top was nil thnt was needed to
mako- tho gentlemen enthusiastic
boosters for Cache.
H . S. Klclnschmldt, engineer in
chargo of the Logan Land and Drain
ago Company's work, Is also at tho
project laying out further work In
the wny of ditching and Improving
the Irrigation system.
