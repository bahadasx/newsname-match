Washington, May 15.?Both th?i
state department and Gen. Carranza,
are awaiting detailed reports of tho
recent El Paso military conference
before seeking an agreement as to
the Mexican border situation through
diplomatic, conversations.
Gen. Scott, chief of staff of the
army, returned here to-day optimistic
over the military situation and
confident that the meeting*} between
himself and Gen. Funston and Gen.
Ohregon, Carranza's war minister,
had created a better understanding
which might furnish the basis for a
formal protocol. The chief of staff
was in need of rest, however, and
did not see Secretary Lansing. , Ho
reported briefly to Secretary Baker.

Asks Von Instructions
Kliseo Arredondo, the Mexican ambassador
designate, asked for instructions
last week. Gen Obregon probably
will not reach Mexico City fol
several days and the reply from Gen,
Carranza is not e*Pected at the em<
onssy until the war minister reports.
War and state department advices
showed no change to-day in the situation
in Mexico or along the border.
While press reports have told of several
minor raids in the last few day*
Gen. Funston either had been unable
to confirm these stories or has
thought them too unimportant to
bring to the attention of the war department.
? ^ .. ^
Administration officials are oonteat
that Funston will be able to prevent
repetitions of the Glenn Springs raid
unless there Is a general antl-Amerlcan
outbreak in which Carranza
troops participate All official advice*
at hand Indicate that Carranza forces
are being disposed to prevent raids
across the line by irresponsible outlaws.
..... _ . , ^ ^ '
' Now Working Together
Gen. Funston's new plan for co-ordinating
the work of the border
guards wras regarded In some quar
lers nere as tending to confirm intimations
that an unwritten agreement
was reached by the jEl Paso conferees.
If the plan Includes an exchange of
information as to bandit activities between
reeposible officers of the Oarranza
troops and the American commanders,
it was thought here considerable
progress could be made
without the troops of either government
crossing th? line.
Mr. Arredondo issued a statement
to-night declaring that the recent return
of Perez Romero to his post as
Mexican ambassador to Tokyo and
the appointment of Rafael Zubaran
as diplomatic agent to Germany and
her allies, as well as to Denmark,
have no significance.
Mr. Arredondo said the Southern
Mexican 8tate?. little afTected by the
revolutions of the last few years, were
making great strides In financial
progress. The government's outstanding
valid obligations have been re*
duced 18 per cent.
