Action Approved.
The council took action last eve
ning after much discussion At a re
cent meeting of taxpayers at the
Commercial club rooms, a majority
present approved the action of the
council and endorsed the plan of the
Second street-Nymore highway
Injure Business.
Several citizens attending the
council meeting last evening opposed
the Second street project, stating that
they believed it would be too expen
sive, that it would lengthen a haul
and that it would injure their busi
ness
Trask pointed out that a com
mittee of seven business men had
viewed the two projects and had come
to the conclusion that the present
crossing could be made safe with a
smaller expense than the construct
ing of the new project. He stated
that he would be willing to act with
a committee and go to Brainerd to
confer with the Minnesota & Inter
national railroad officials He urged
the paving of First street between Be
mulji and Beltrami avenues so that
traffic to that end of the city to Ny
more would have a shorter hai 1
No Action Taken.
Alderman Bailey and Ervin told
of the ettorts of the past several years
with the railroad for improving the
present crossing No action was
taken by the railway and action was
now urged by the council
W Harnwell urged the paving
of Beltrami avenue to Minnesota on
First street It was pointed out by
aldermen that there was no First
street between these avenues and
that the property was owned by the
railway company. In regard to the
proposed highway routes, Mr Harn
well stated that he would not con
sider the present route unless it was
made convenient and safe
Favors Present Route.
Isted stated that he favored
the present route if it could be maOe
safe "I presume the council knows
what it is doing," said Mr. Isted. "The
present crossing is very dangerous."
It was pointed out that the Minne
sota & International railway com
pany was opposing the new project
probably because of the assessing of
pavement in case the new route was
selected.
Favors Little Expense.
A. M. Bagley stated that although
he had spoken previously in favor of
the Second street route he would like
to see the old route used if it could
be made safe and convenient at a less
expense than the new route.
Frank Koors urged the paving of
First street between Beltrami and
Bemidji avenues and the retaining of
the present route.
Approves Bonds.
The council approved the bonds of
Goodman & Loitved for $13,200 on
contracts for pavements, sewers and
water mains.
Engineer Swinson submitted an es
timate of $60 for the repairing of
Twelfth street between Dalton and
Park avenues. He was requested to
see that all citizens signed the peti
tion for the repairing.
Miller Gets Contract.
James R. Miller was awarded the
contract for the grading and surfac
ing of the road west of Fourth street
to the city limits. His bid was
$452.75. Goodman & Loitved sub
mitted a bid of $479.50 and H. Wes
ley Wright submitted a bid of
$498.50.
The state board of health urged
several improvements to the local
water works system so that the water
could be used on railway trains. The
err- *f^avj
improvements were ordered made.
The city engineer was ordered to
estimate on the cost of connecting
Doud avenue to Tenth street to the
Elwell road on the lake shore.
Fire limits were ordered changed
so as not to apply to the west side
of the block on Bemidji avenue from
Fourth to Fifth streets This was
done at the request of Hon. E. J.
Swedback.
Morris Kaplan was granted permis
sion to use one-third of Second street
and Minnesota avenue while con
structing his new building on the site
of the old Rex hotel.
The city council appropriated $50
to be used for Memorial day expenses.

RUGGLES PINES

Stated Authoritatively That Timber
Near Bemidji is Offered for
Sale.
SPECIFIED NOT TO BE
CUT AT MILLS HERE
Cutting May Begin Immediately
Chicago Lumbermen
Interested.
The widely known Ruggles timber
near Bemidji has been placed on the
market through brokers in Duluth
and Chicago, according to authorita
tive information brought to this city
by a lumberman. As yet the timber
has not been sold. The sale speci
fies that the timber is to be cut at
Little Falls, Walker or Deer River
mills No mention is made of the
mills in Bemidji.
Lumbermen Interested.
It is reported that Chicago lumber
men are interested in the sale of the
timber and that the timber will be
purchased. Cutting will probably
commence soon after the sale is com
pleted.
The Ruggles timber on the east
shore of Lake Bemidji and north of
Bemidji has often been spoken of as
an excellent location for a state park.
When the members of the state legis
lature visited Bemidji last year they
favored the park project and at a
mock session of the legislature estab
lished the park. It is believed that
if the timber is not sold by the time
the legislature meets that action will
be taken by the legislature.
Refuses Request.
When Mr. Ruggles was in Bemidji
several weeks ago, the Commercial
club requested him to keep the tim
ber standing until the city or the
state was in condition to set it aside
as a state park. According to the
reports received in Bemidji it is evi
dent that he refuses to wait for the
city.
It is believed that advances will be
made to Mr Ruggles again to have
him keep the timber standing until
after the legislative session next
year.
At the meeting of the city council
last evening A P. White as chairman
of the charter commission stated that
the commission would prepare an
amendment to the charter soon to
provide for the establishment of a
park board and to raise funds for
such a purpose as the securing of the
Ruggles timber.
