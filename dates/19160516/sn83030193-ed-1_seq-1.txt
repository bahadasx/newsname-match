The Thompson Committee' Investigation Into the matter of tapping
telephone wires, with police or olllciul connivance, for the purpose of over
hearing, private conversation!) reveals that the practice has prevailed In this
city for tho last twenty-one years. It became a part of the system of
police espionage, worked In harmony with the management of tho tele
phono company, In 1895. when William L. Strong was Mayor. Tho Police
Board at that tlmo consisted of Tluodoro itooscvclt, President; Avery D.
Andrews, Andrew Parker and Frederick Dent Grant.
Ever since 1895. through the nd-t '

LOVE NOTES SENT

Judge Rules Letters of Marian

JURY IS HARD TO GET.
Father of Slain Girl Declares
He Does Not Want Ac

WAUKEGAN. 111.. May H.-Two
eeta of love letters, which the prose,
eurlon of William H. Orpet bellows
will ehow a motive for tho killing of
Marian Lambert, will or put In evi
dence at Orpet'a trial for her murder.
With the Jury yet to be socured,
Judge Charles II. Donnelly made two
rulings that wtlt bare the letters
one set from the irlrl Orpet ilnnned
lo wd, tha other from.Orpet to the
little 1ugh school sweetheart whom he
jilted.
Judge Donnelly ordered the letters
written Orpet by Miss Celestlii Toil
ker, a normal school teacher to whom
the. youth was engaged, bo given by
the prosecution to the clerk of the
court and copies tumexl over to tho
defonsc. Then he ruled that tho let
ters written by Orpet to Marian se
cret notes, written In French may
remain In tho sole itossesslon of the
Htato for the present. These will he
Introduced In evldenco later in the
trial.
Tho letters to 'Marian aro saild to
havo been In reply to iher notes, ox
pressing fears of the consequences of t
her alleged Intrigue. The letters of
Miss Youker are said to breathe
tender love for Orpot.
Tho selection of a Jury to to' Orpet
Is proccixllng very slowly, awl It Is
believed It may take a week to lilt
the Jury box.
Only threo Jurors have been tenta
tively chosen so fur. Amongthu venire
men summoned wore many farmers
eager to get back to their fields and
Zlonltoa whose religious scruples
would prevent them from Imposing
tho death sentence.
Tho questions of State's Attorney
Dady Indicated that ho will ask for
the extreme penalty and that he de
pends on circumstantial evidence to
win his case.
Orpet's counsel Intimate they ex
pect to provo the girl committed sui
cide by drinking cyanide, through a
lotter written to her by Orpet, In
which he said, "Don't do anything
desperate until I arrive"
Orpet was In court to. hay half an
hour before Judge Donnelly mounted
the bench. Ho seemed refreshed and
said hu had slept well last night. For
the first tlmo In weeks, his pnlo face
showed color. He greeted each uf
his four lawyers with a handshake
and a thin smllo. Mrs. Orpet came
Into the court room a few minutes
later. Hho rushed to her son's side
and kissed him tenderly.
Celestla Youker, chemistry teacher
In the De Kalb (III.) High Hchool, for
whom It l alleged Orpet threw over
Marian, will be a witness, it was defi
nitely decided to-day. Shu will b
summoned by the State.
Frank Lambert does not want tlie
son of his neighbor hanged for thu
crime, ho said to-day.
"Sometimes It is bettor that it man
be nut hanged," said Lambert.
"There Is harder punishment. I wish
Orpert would mako a clean breast of
the whole thing. I believed he killed
my daughter. 1 wish he would con
fess and accept a light prl.iun sen
tence. I would be sathtled that Jus
tice, wus served and that a mother
was not robbed of her only child
without punishment. Vengeance Is
the last wish I would ever make."

LONDON, May 16. The story of the scuttling of tlie German
auxiliary cruiser that was to land 20,000 rifles and 1,000,000 rounds of
ammunition In Ireland iu support of Sir Roger Casement's rebellion was
told to-day at the continuance of Sir Roger's hearing on the charge -of, ;
treason in the Bow Street Police Court.
The testimony regarding the ship was given by Sidney Waghorn, a
signaller on board the Admiralty sloop Bluebell which overhauled the
auxiliary off the Irish coast.

Tho position of the Central Towers

Allies will not be able to accomplish
mom In tho future than they havo In
tho past, which Is "nothing," In tho
opinion or Llout..Oen. Count Hoi

nian army, expressed In an Inter
view granted to tho Ilerlln corro
spondent of the Hungarian news
paper Avllag.
France, says C!en. von Moltke,
already has nearly nil her available
reserves In the field and has re
cruited her youngest men to an ex
tent exceeding that of tho Central
Powers. As to England, even If she
adopts compulsory service, nhu will
add only a few hundred thousand
men to tlie form she already has In
tho Held and will have little effect In
determining th" war.
The Itusslans, the Count declares,
are unable, to asiume a general offen
sive, nnd the lines of the Central
I'owers In Kuasla are so strong that
thoy cannot bo breached. Tho Italians
stand In the same place as they did a
year ago, and It Is Inconceivable that
they can break the Austrian lino.

At that tlmo we wero ubout 139,

"Wo ordered tho And to follow us,
but sho did not do so until wo fired

"When we got near Haunt's Hock
the Aud stopped her engines. Thu
Hluebell was then a cable's length
away fium her, and wo saw whllu
smoke coming from her after hold.
Two Herman ensigns wero run up on
her masthead.
Tho Aud lowered two boats which
were rowed toward the Hluebell. Wo
fired around these boats. They flew
flags of trucu and the occupants put
up their hands. They were made
prisoners.
"They proved to bo 19 or 20 tier
man bluejackets, with three officers.
Ten minutes later, the Aud sank,
about a mllo and a quarter from the
lightship."
Waghorn was followed on tho stand
by a diver who Inspected the wreck
of the Aud for the purpose of con
firming tho statement that she had
arms and ammunition aboard,
"The And lay In about eighteen
fathoms of water." tho diver said.
"She had the Norwegian flag painted
