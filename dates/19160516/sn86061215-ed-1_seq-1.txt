VOLUME SIXTY-EIGHT
Vicinity of Brownsville Is
to Get Attention From
Mexican Bandits
PATROL FORCE TO
BE STRENGTHENED
Scott Back in Washington
to Report on Failure of
Recent Conference
Lake Itsseate, Mexico, May 14.
»-By wireless to Columbus, N.
M., May 15.—Three bandita, in
cluding Julio Cardenas, the Villis
ta leader, were killed in a skir
mish with an American detach
merit near Rubio ranch, twenty
ml lee eaat of here, today.
San Antonio, Tex., May 15.—Inform
ation Indicating a plan for the resump
tion of raids across the international
line near Brownsville, Tex., has
reached army headquarters here and
will, It Is expected, cause a consider
able strengthening of the force now
patrolling that district. Gen. Funston
and staff will study the proposed re
organization of the entire border
patrol and it was indicated that the
thirtieth Infantry, coming from New
York state, would be sent to Rio
Grande City for service between there
and Brownsville, the district so fre
quently raided a year ago.
Official reports from the officer com
manding gave no additional details
of the actlvtles of armed bands op
posite Progreso, Tex., but their pres
ence there was in line with reports
made by both agents of the deo&rt
taent of justice and the agents of the
state department.
No apparent anxiety regarding the
position of the little force that entered
Mexico near Boquillas was Indicated
at headquarters. Col. Sibley is com
manding only four troops of cavalry
and a machine gun company, but army
men here believe that he would have
no difficulty in withdrawing if menac
ed by a superior force.
Gen. Scott will see Secretary Lan*
sing tomorrow and meanwhile no steps
will be taken to reopen diplomatic ne
gotiations for a formal agreement with
Gen. Carranza. Secretary Baker in
dicated, however, that Gen. Scott
thought there would be no great de
lay in arriving at an understanding
and formulating a protocol.
Pending the ratification of an agree
ment, Carranza troops are being
moved northward into the bandit rid
den portions of Mexico. The AmerK
can expeditionary foroe under Gen.
Pershing is being withdrawn into
strong groups on the line of com
munication where it will await the
outcome of Gen. Obregon's efforts to
clean up the territory to the south.
Gen. FunBton has mapped out a co
ordinated scheme for border patrol
with, the 35,000 men he will soon have
available for that purpose, exclusive
of the 14,000 or so in Gen. Pershing's
column.
SCOTT TO REPORT.
Washington, D. C., May 15.—On his
return today from El Paso, MaJ. Gen.
Scott, chief of staff, had a detailed re
port of his protracted conferences with
Gen. Obregon, Carranza war minister,
to present to President Wilson, Sec
retary Baker and Secretary Lansing.
Officials were anxious to learn pre
cisely why the Mexican general de
clined to sign an agreement covering
operation of American troops in Mex
ico, particularly in view of official no
tification that Gen. Carranza had ap
proved the original draft of the proto
col.
Gen. Scott's discussions with offi
cials probably will occupy several
days. Not until they are completed
will diplomatic conferences be ar
ranged with Eliseo Arredondo, Mexi
can ambassador designate, on the dis
position of American troops and the
vexatious question of protecting the
American border from Mexican bandit
raids.
MEXICANS AT BORDER.
Brownsville, Tex., May 15. —A con
siderable number of armed Mexicans
is patrolling the Rio Grande opposite
Hidalgo, Tex., sixty-five miles west of
here, according to a report received
today at Ft. Brown. This report was
given to Consul J. J. Garza by Col. A.
P. Blockson, with a request that an in
vestigation be made.
Renewed activity on the part of An
lceto Piazana and Luis de la Rosa, al
leged leaders of the "TejtfJb revolution"
also was reported.

SUPERSEDED DY
LONG EARED PACK ANIMAL IN
VALUABLE IN THE CHASE
AFTER MEXICAN8...
Field Headquarters, May 8. —By
army motor truck to Columbus, N. M.,
May 15. —The value of
the
truckB
in the Villa chase
demonstrated their adaptability for
mountain transportation, has been v4n
dicated by the results of this cam
paign.
In transporting supplies overland to
the main bases, through a country
without railroads, the automobile
trucks fiave proven much superior to
the old fashioned mule teams, the re
liance when Geronimo was pursued
through this same country. Meanwhile
the mules as pack animals have gone
beyond the new truck lines into coun
try where no Vheeled vehicle yet in
vented can move, crossing chasm and
climbing through mountain forests
where it has been necessary to trample
paths through the brush.
These mules proved more hardy
than horses in the hard bandit chases.
They ifrere better able to live off the
country without loss of strength. They
ate almost everything except rocks and
one kind of rope. The one rope which
they would not eat was the Mexican
lariat, made out of horse hair.
While the animals did not actually
take much leather or other foreign
substance into their stomachs,, they
werev continually chewing at harness
when it was within reach, to get the
slightly salty taBte it possesses. The
mules also nibbled at trees, dead
weeds, sticks and dirt. On the moun
tain marches they thrived fairly well,
while carrying heavy loads of food and
ammunition behind the cavalry col
umns.
EXPEDITION HALTS.
Marathon, Tex., May 15.—The ex
pedition in .search of the bandits who
committed the Glenn Springs outrage
has checked its dash into Mexibo and
is now awaiting reinforcements before
pushing on," according to report® re
ceived here today. A message has
been sent to Gen. Funston by Col. Sib
ley, commanding the fourteenth cav
alry, it was learned here, asking for
aid.
Military observers here point out
that Maj. Langhorne and his flying
squadron of the eighth cavalry are
now perhaps 800 miles beyond their
base without sufficient troops to pro
tect their line of communication. Mar
athon, the base, is ninety miles dis
tant from Boquillas over broken coun
try. Several instances have been re
ported the past few days of bandits
cutting in behind the expedition with
out meeting armed resistance.
Supplies of every character are now
being rushed from Marathon to Bo
quillas, there to be transferred to pack
animals for Sibley's expedition. Mex
ican teamsters are engaged in this
work under Capt. John S. Chambers
of the quartermaster's department.
He reports the Mexicans faithful to
their trust. No supplies have failed
to reach their destination. The two
Mexican prisoners brought in to Mara
thon by Sheriff Shoemaker from Bo
quillas last Saturday night will be sent
to Alpine for trial for murder.
WILSON HOME AGAIN.
Washington, D. C., May 15.—Presi
dent and Mrs. Wilson returned early
today from their week end cruise
aboard the naval yacht Mayflower.
The homeward trip was without spe
cial incident.
Immediately after his return to the
white house the president read sev
eral dispatches on Mexico received
since his departure Friday, which Gen.
Bliss, acting chief of staff, thought
were not important enough to send
him by wireless. He had engage
ments with a large number of senatprs
and representatives to discuss legisla
tive matters and saw Gov. Dunne of
Illinois.
Ml VIGOROUS PROTEST
American Officials Preparing Drastic
Note Which Will Be Sent to the
British Government.
Washington, D. C., May 15—The
American government is preparing a
protest characterized by officials as
"very vigorous", against the interfer
ence with mails to and from the Unit
ed States by Great, Britain. A note to
be sent forward in the near future
will take the, position that the Unit
ed States can no longer countenance
seizure and detention of mailB to and
from the United States, particularly
those concerning neutrals.

Washington, X). C., May 15.—Repre
sentative Ralney of Illinois, in charge
of the tariff commission bill in the
house, discussed the final draft with
President Wilson today and told him
that he expected the ways and means

REVOLT LEADER
GOES ON TRIAL
Sir Roger Casement Faces
High Treason Charge
in Police Court
IRISH SOLDIER IS
ALSO IN DOCKET
Numerous Lords and Ladies
in Court Room Where
Case Is in Progress
London, May 15.—Sir Roger Case*
ment, who only a few years ago
achieved international fame for the
services he rendered his government
in the exposure of the Putumayo rub
ber, atrocities, today faced the bar in
an 'ordinary police court for prelim
inary examination to determine
whether he should be held for trial
on the charge of high treason against
the same government in connection
with the rebellion in Ireland. Beside
Casement stood Daniel Julian Bailey,
who faced a similar charge.
Not in many years has, so much pop
ular Interest been manifested in a
case before the courts. This is due
not only to the prominence of Case
ment and to speculation as to his fate,
but also because it has been expected
evidence would be produced which
would lay bare a widespread plot re
sulting in the revolt.
Among the earliest arrivals in court
were Sir Horace Plunkett of the de
partment of agriculture in Ireland. It
was understood Sir Horace was merely
a spectator. Many relatives and
friends of Casement, including seven
handsomely gowned women, reached
court early and were provided with
seats well to the front.
Sir Roger maintained much of his
characteristic complaisance. He
smiled and nodded as he saw friends
in the court room.
With Sir Roger was Daniel Bailey,
an Irish soldier captured by the Ger
mans early in the war. He went from
GerfflSHyto" Ireland In the submarine
with Sir Rodger and was taken pris
oner at Tralee.
As the examination proceeded Sir
Roger showed in his movements some
slight indications of the nervous strain
under which he was laboring. He paid
strict attention to the proceedings,
however* and occasionally took notes
which he handed to his counsel.

province of Ruanda on May* 8. The

island of Kivlulvi in Lake Kivu which
the Germans took by surprise at the
beginning of the war.
WAR SUMMARY.
Sharper fighting is now in progress
in other sectors of the western front
than in the Verdun region, upon which
attention has been chiefly centered
for nearly three months.
Notable activity has been reported
recently along the British lines in
fiorthern France and Flanders and to
day Paris records brisk action by the
artillery on both sides in the Cham
pagne, the scene of the main French
drive in last September's offensive.
At Verdun, the play of the heavy
guns is being kept up to some extenst,
there having been bombardments in
the sectors of the Avocourt wood and
Hill 304, northwest of the fortress.
Le Mort Homme, northwest of Ver
dun, is being heavily bombarded by
the Germans. The Germans entered
British trenches in the Ploegert wood,
but were ejected while the British
took some German trenches south of
La Bassee canal.
The Italians vigorously attacked the
Austrians on. the Doberdo plateau,
west of San Martino, but they were
repulsed, according to Vienna.
An address yesterday by President
Poincare of France has attracted wide
attention. The central powers, he said,
had not offered France peace and
France did not want such an offer.
"We want them to afek it of us," said
the president. "We do not want to
submit to their conditions we want
to impose ours on them."
The only infantry engagements of
importance, according to the latest re
ports from' the war fronts, have oc
curred in Asiatic Turkey between the
Russians and the Turks. Irf the reg
ion'south of the Black sea and west
of the Persian border the Russians are
trying to reach Mesopotamia, with Big
dad and a junction with the British
forces their objective.
Northwest of Erzerum, the Turks
claim to have repulsed the Russians
with heavy losses. The Russians ad
mit the Turks forced their advance
guards to retire at some points but
say the Ottoman forces desisted in
their attacks after having suffered
"extremely heavy" casualties.

DOY REGIMENT IT
CULVER STARTS ON
TRAINING COURSE
SIX HUNDREDY0UNQSTER8, SOME
OF THEM FROM IOWA, BEGIN
MILITARY DRILL.
Culver, Ind., May 15.—Six hundred
boy soldiers Btarted in the making at
the second annual military instruction
camp opened today by the Culver mili
tary academy. The embryo soldiers
are high school students gathered
from Indiana and adjoining states for
two weeks of Intensive military train
ing. The boys will live in tents and
will undergo all the conditions of regu
lar field service with the United
States army.
Iowa has a delegation of boys in
camp and there are a number of stud
ents from Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and
Kentucky, making the acquaintance of
life in a shelter tent.'
The camp is designed, according to
Col. L. R. Glgnilliant, commandant, to
be of especial benefit to boys whose
local schools contemplate the introduc
tion of military training during the
next school year and, it is said, several
students are being sent to the camp
by municipalities with the object of
making the boys the leaders in the
work of organizing the home school
for military training purposes. Two
weeks spent at Culver will enable the
boys to lend valuable service to their
schools and also will enable them to
add their part to the nation's military
efficiency.
While the arrival here today will be
the first military experience of many
of the boys, yet they will not be en
tirely Ignorant of military affairs. To
each applicant for permission to enter
the camp, the Culver authorities sent a
book of instructions, designed to give
the boy an idea of the work he will bo
expected to do while at Culver. Those
sufficiently interested to enter ":o
camp, it is believed, will familiarize
themselves with a large amount of in
structions, which he would, otherwise,
have had to learn in camp, such as
nomenclature of the rifle, manual of
arms, elements of squad movement*,
the signal code, elements of target
designation and the like. This plan,
the authorities believe will give more
time for Held work.
The course of instruction for the two
weeks is designed to take up as much
in detail as possible, the following
phases of military instruction: Manual
of arms, foot niovements, squad drill,
company drill, battalion drill, extend
ed order, advance guard, outpost duty,
patrolling, construction of wire en
tanglements, trench making, hipp
ology, field signallylng with telephone
buzzer, heliograph, semaphore, wigj
wag and wireless, first aid, hospital
drill, care of transportation, care of
wounded, camp sanitation, camp cook
ing, shelter, tent pitching, elements
of artillery drill, manipulation of
piecesm gallery practice, rifle practice
of .range, map sketching, wall scaling,
ami operating an automatic rifle.
There will be a number of hikes and
possible an over night camp. There
also will be a number of field man
euvers which will illustrate the ele
ments of combat and fire control.
While here, the boys will be organ
ized into companies of fifty each, with
an officer of the academy in Immediate
command. Additional officers and non
commissioned officers will be chosen
from the experienced cadets at the
academy and from among the students
themselves that show special aptitude
for the work.
Culver authorities make it plain that
the campers will have plenty of work,
but add that there will be time for
considerable recreation each day.
ROBBER8 WRECK SALOON.
Streator, 111., May 15.—Robbers en
