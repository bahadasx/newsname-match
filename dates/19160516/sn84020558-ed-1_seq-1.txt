While considerable
intro-
testimony
duced by the crown tended to incrim

prosecution was directed against
Casement In an endeavo' to enmesh
him in a Ml of evidence which would
tablish without question the lead

the conspiracy, whose ramifications
extended over to America.
Ca semen! himself was the center of
all ey-es during tile flay. It was evi

before the bar, for, despite the un
kempt condition of his clothing, he
made a striking figure, witli newly
trimmed beard and hair blushed well
back from a high forehead, under
neiith which were the deep-set eyes
of the dreamer.
Casement busied himself tajiing
notes, indicating, that he Intended to
have a hand in the presentation of
Ills defeime. He was always self
possessed and. as the ease wore on,
began to assume considerable assur

thrills, the prosecution devoting its

and then shifted abrupt I

It .was during his address
attorney general introduced
that the
a letter
written by Casement thanking Sir
Edward Grey, the JSritbih secretary
for foreign affairs, lot the knight
hood conferred upon him in reCOgmi-
J tion of his Putanumo service. in
this letter Casement said:
"I am Indeed grateful to you for
this singular assurance of your ir
sonal interest. I am very sensible of
the honor done me by his ma jest v.
and would beg that my humble duty
may be presented to his majesty
when you can do me the

The attorney genera! introduced
another striking feature when he
paused In his speech to produce In
court the flag which j' is asserted
Casement and his companions brought
from Germany to Ireland. This was
the emblem of revolt a green flag
with a yellow castle upon it and un
der the castle the motto
"tiros anthpia fuit studisipie aspar-
Ima belli."
Casement's attorney made little atr
lean pi to croes-enaasne today, but
several times questioned the witnesses
as to why Casement wished them to
Join the Irish brigade. The point of
tile ipiestions seemed to be to show
that the freedom of Ireland was the
only thing Involved and I he,) the hri-,
