JUDGE EVANS FIRED
JUSTICE WILL
RESIST MAYOR
Long standing animosity be
tween Mayor Faweett and I'ollce
• Judge Evans today came to a
climax when the mayor served
notice on the magnlsiarte that ho
was dismissed as police court
judge.
Evans declared that he would
light removal, lie takes the at
titude that the mayor has no
right to revoke the appointment
and that for him to assume Ihe
right is an invasion of Ihe judi
cial Bphere.
Oraliaui Slated For I'lace.
If the mayor wins out In his
' attempt to oust Evans, he says,
he will appoint as police judge
Justice Frank Graham. He Is
limited In his selection to the
Incumbent justices of peace in
this county.
Mayor Faweett made a pre
vious effort to dismiss Police
Judge Evans, a year ago, but was
• advised by former City Attorney
Stiles that be did not have tbe
power to discharge the judge
after appointing him.
Harmon Rules Oilier Way.
V. E. Harmon, the new cll> at
torney, has Investigated the law,
, and given the mayor an opin
ion to the effect that he can term
inate the police judge's tenure of
office at any time.
Judge Evans today declared
the mayor would have to use
force to get rid of him.
"The law takes this office out
of politics, by refusing to allow
, the appointing power to dismiss
the judge until his term has ex
pired," he said.
"Otherwise, the court would bo
dominated by the mayor. Faweett
has made efforts to dictate to me
In various cases, and I have re
fused to let him control the
court. That's why he wants to
get rid of me."
Salary Cv( Off.
Mayor Faweett said today that
be had terminated Judge Evans'
salary and that If the police judse
wanted to remain on the job, he
would do it for no compensation.
"And if anyone wants to resist
his decisions, they can do so by
merely refusing to obey," said
Faweett. "Evans will not have
, the police judgeship, and his rul
ings will have no weight."
The mayor based his dismissal
of Judge Evans on the fact that
the judge had refused recently to
accede to the council's plan of
cutting expenses by abolishing
the police court rlerk, because
the judge had given heavier fines
to women prisoners than to men,
« and because the revenue of the
police court was falling off.
Economy
t There can be no ques
tion about this being the
economical age; not so
much because the money
is not being earned, but
( everyone now la getting
to grasp the Idea of a
savinga account and
save something for a
rainy day. This Is the
most economical way to
lire.

"Judge Evans has been letting
offenders off with fines that were
so small as to be ridiculous," ne
explained. "He has punished
women severely, and let. men off
with small lines, when their of
fense* were even more serious
than those of the women."
1 The police judge resented tkil
charge.
"1 consider that this is a court
of justice, and not of revenue,"
he declared. "I am here to pun
ish persons for wrong-doing, no!
lo make a lot of money for the
city.
("Hy Pay* $.10.
"It Is unfortunate thai this
has occurred, but 1 am not going
j to allow the mayor to dominate
litis court, and I am going to
fight ills effort to get rid of me."

a month from the county as sal

FIGHT RAISE IN
SEATTLE FARE
SEATTLE, May 16.—Claiming
that the Puget Sound Navigation
Co.'s proposal to increase tbe
boat fares between Tacoma and
Seattle is but an attempt to raise
money to fight competition on
the Sound and put an end to the
strike of the steanishlpmen, rep
resentatives of Tacoma and Seat
tle labor unions entered a strong
protest at the public service com
mission here today.
The tariff filed by the naviga
tion company with the public ser
. ice commission calls for an In
crease from ,"i0 to 66 cents in tbe
round trip fare and from It to
40 cents in one way tickets.
Four Hunts on Run!
In an effort to show the com
mission that they are not getting
a fair return on their investment,
officers of tbe navigation com
pany testified that four boots are
being used on the Tacoma and
Seat lie run.
In addition to the Tacoma and
Indianapolis, the company claim
ed that the steamers Flyer and
Chippewa were used on the run,
and that ihe lour boats did not
pay with tbe present rates.
State Denies It.
This statement was contradict
ed by (). O. Calderhead, the com
mission's rate expert, who was
the first slate witness called by
Chairman Reynolds.
He testified that there were
only two steamers on the regular
run, the Tacoma and the Indian
spoils, and that his investigation
showed that the company was
getting an unusually fair return
on these two vessels.
Assertions were made that the
company is attempting to com
plete a monopoly of sound steam

Judge was told.
"What about?" demanded the
judge. "What report?"
A copy of Saturday's paper was
produced.
The judge carefully read the
account of the Lyen trial.
"1 don't see anything in this
account that did not take place
In court," the judge said.
The eagerness of tbe attorneys
to put the reporter on the stand
thereupon cooled rather suddenly.
lugold Johnson, a schoolboy
friend of the girl, continued his
testimony from Saturday.
Other charketpr witnesses for
the girl were Agnes Aschlur", a
girl chum; P. V. Vncdal, a photog
rapher; Samuel Wilson, her fa

Postpone
Democrat
Campaign
By Gilson Gardner.
Washington, May 16. The
democratic presidential campaign
will not begin until midsummer
or fall.
President Wilson has decided
that lor the present there is
nothing for him or lilb friends to
do but to sit tight.
■ There will be no headquarters
opened, no extensive organization
undertaken, no solicitation or
campaign funds. no literature
prepared la fact, none of the
usual campaign activities.
This is contrary to the advice
of some of the president's politi
cal trtendl, including Secretaries
Lane and MeAdoo.
Mr. Wilson is going on the
theory that there are no Issues
until ihe opposition develops
them, and that any day may pro
duce international complications
so overwhelming as to drown any
supposed issues.
By August or September, he
figures, he can tell what kind of
a campaign, if any, (he democrats
ought tc make.
