The entire committee appointed by
the chairman of the loan fund com
mission to inspect the 'safety of the
Nuuanu reservoir went up to the dam
this morning. Plans of the structure
and photographs of it during the va
rious stages of its construction were
examined.
' At the toe of the dam where the
leaks are most pronounced a visit was
also made, and all the committee
seemed of the opinion that the leak
age was largely due to spring under
neath the dam area, rather than to
any loss through the dam Itself. The
members of the committee will study
the plans further in the next few days
and will spend the larger part of Sun
day in a further investigation. A re
port will probably be made following
this second trip.

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 16.
Brought rapidly to the fore again, the
government shipping bill was sent to
debate in the house today under a spe
cial rule facilitating discussion and
action. Chairman Kitchin of the ways
and means committee said that the
house would pass this, the appropria
tion bills and other important mea
sures and be ready to a"djourn July 20,
"if you Democrats do your duty." A
vote will be taken on the shipping bill
Friday.
IS IN TROUBLE
Ah Kim will be arraigned in police
court in the morning charged with
having about $1S0 worth of opium in
his possession. Kim was arrested on
Beretania street near - Smith last
night by Capt. of Detectives McDuf
fie. Two others. Ah Hina and Tons
Sang, who were with Kim at the time,
were taken for investigation.
Because the tin in which the opium
was found bears the government
stamp which admitted opium to the
islands prior to 19o9, the federal au
thorities have thought best to leave
the case in the hands of the jolice.
McDuffie ' took up the matter with
the new United States district attor
ney, S. C. Huber.
Although Ah Kim and Ah Hina were
both witnesses against Jesse Gray,
former policeman, during his .famous
"graft" hearing, Capt. McDuffie says
that had nothing to do with the ar
rests. :
"I didn't know they had anything
to do with the" Gray case," said the
captain today, "until after they were
arrested. They were not taken for
what they might have said or done"
but from the evidence which we saw
ourselves."

I'nited States has no other purpose than to eliminate brigandage along
the border.

the Carranzistas shall endeavor to demonstrate their ability to handle
