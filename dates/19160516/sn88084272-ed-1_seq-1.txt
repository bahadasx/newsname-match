Mrs. Waite declared she was tvllllna;
to testify at the trial of her husband.
"It is my duty to be at the trial If
needed," said Mrs. Waite. "I am not
anxious to go, but I feel that ft Is my
duty to my parents and I am ready to
do anything for that reason.
"In my husband's case there may have
been a lack of moral balance, but there
was no lack of responsibility. There
was no fit of anger, no Jealousy, the
motive was money. Love was showered
I on him. He is absolutely out of my life j
' now. The ideal he represented to me
will always be one that I shall care
about, any girl would. But he wasn't
that ideal. He was a different person
to me He always deceived me."

America to Supply Entente.
I In response to a question as to
I whether he believed the United States
would continue to furnish ammunition
to the allies, even in case of a breach of
diplomatic relations or actual war or
whether it would retain the ammunition
for itself. Gen. von Moltke replied:
... .?m ,irmI' convinced that nothing
will hinder America from continuing to
futni&h ammunition. America desires
to do business and her desire is compre
hensible. Her chief aim is good busi
rtesa Pres.dent Wilson has heretofou
issued no prohibition upon the expor
tation of ammunition, nor will he in the
future. The Americans declare thev are
not violating neutrality by munit.on
exportation because thev also would
have gladly furnished munitions to us
This Is, however, as it chances, unnec
essary. "The American government factor!. t
. do not furnish any ammunition to the
I entente; but that is immaterial for the
private factories slinplv furnish the
imore."

Gen von Moltke declared that the
