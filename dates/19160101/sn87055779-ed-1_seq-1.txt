END OF WAR
SOHENEARER
Warring Nations Too Busy to
Take Mental Stock of
Conditions.
Associated I'resn Service:
I,ONIOX, Dec. 31, 10:01 p. m.
The last day of the year found the
Kuropean belligerents too busily
occupied with matters of pressing
importance to pause lo..c enough to
do any extensive menta stock taking i
regarding1 the war eonc ons.
To most of the iiphtinff nations
the war probably seemed rather
nearer its end a year ao than now.
For tlreat Ilritoin its unfortunate
year pass?s into history with a fresh
naval calamity the sinking of the
cruiser Natal.
The last day of the old year was
a buy one for tho British cabinet,
which accomplished peacefully the
unprecedented task of holding two
rneetincs in a single day. It now
appears that the momentous transi
tion to compulsory service in (Ireat
Hritain Is likely to be accomplished
with tranquility.
The press of all shades of opinion
already is exulting that "no change
of equal importance was ever enact
ed with such a lack of disturbance
or with so close an approach to pub-
j lie unanimity."
On the lighting fronts the year
ends with a promise of interesting
developments In many theaters.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 31. Otticial
government figures made public here
today disclosed that in the face of
rising prices of gasoline, production
of crude petroleum during the last
year was greater than In 1914, al
though production was "purposely
retarded as far as practicable" that
reserve stocks of crude petroleum
now being held in the country are
the largest ever recorded, and that
exports of gasoline, to which the
rise in prices frequently has been
attributed, were in the last 10
months of 1915 less than the ex
ports during the corresponding
period of the two years previous.
Iloth the department of Justice and
the federal trade commission are
preparing to investigate gasoline
prices. A statement issued by the
geological survey estimated the 1915
production of market petroleum at
267,400,000 barrels, 200,000 more
than in ,914.

International News Service:
WASHINGTON. Dec. 31. The
grippe epidemic has reached almost
every city in the United Slates, ac -
cording to reports which began com
ing in today to the United . States
public health ervice. Including
every corner of the country.
Health authorities of Illinois and
Indiana informed the health service
that the epidemic now prevails in
every city in thesj states and la in
vading the rural sections.
While the health service is lack-
ln' in data of the number of grippe
cases and the deaths resulting from
them, it was stated today that it has
no hope of effeotuilly combating the
malady. It can do no more than
issue warnings and let the epidemic

"As a result of the overload put
on 'the transporting; and refining
capacities of the petroleum industry
by the excess output of . 1914, the
year 1913 may be characterized as a
period of readjustment in which pro
duction activity was purposely re
tarded as far as practicable. The
small increase, therefore, is more
significant than the simple figures
indicate."
Factors that might be expected to
affect the price of gasoline, accord
ing1 to geological survey oihcials, are
production, consumption and prices
of crude petroleum. Consumption
figures, they said, were not available,
though consumption was increasing.
A low petroleum level was reach
ed in April and until August the
price remained at $1.35 a barrel for
the market standard. Then the
price began to soar and on Iec. 17
petroleum was selling at $2.15.
Indications' are now, says the "state
ment, that the price soon will reach
J2.51, its previous high record.
