WASHINGTON, Dec. 31. Austria's
reply to the Ancona note not only
meets the cardinal points of the
American demands, but gives assur
ances for the future which are con
sidered more satisfactory in their ex
tent than those which were given by
Germany. -
The full American official view will
not be known until after President
' Wilson has studied the Austrian re
ply, which was received today from
Ambassador Penfield and was imme
diately dispatched to Hot Springs, by
a AVhite House messenger.
It may be stated authoritatively
nevertheless, that danger f a rupture
of diplomatice relations has passed,
and that the controversy now enters
the same stage as tne Lusitania ne
gotiations with Germany, on even a
more favorable basis.
Austria in the Ancona case has sub
scribed to the principle that no ships
would be sunk until they offer resist
ance or flee, without the persons
aboard being brought to safety. Th:s
is considered an assurance that is far
reaching and satisfactory.
Germany only promised not to at
tack "liners" until the persons aboard
had been placed in boats. The extent
of the designation "liners" never has
been cleared up and the American
government does not concede that
placing persons in boats necessarily
assures their safety.
Points which Austria leaves for lur
ther diplomatic correspondence are not
considered of a nature to bring on a
new crisis. Chief among them ire
questions of fact which affect Aus
tria's responsibility for what happened
before the submarine commander tor
pedoed the Ancona, and their import
ance is minimized by the promise to
pay indemnity for Americans lost re
gardless of the absence of proof as it.
just how they met their death.
The mere statement that the sub
marine commander has been punished
for not making allowance for the panic
on the ship undoubtedly will be ac
cepted without question and without
further inquiry as to its nature.
One of the features of the case
. which has attracted v. ;ae attention in
official and diplomatic quarters is the
apparent similarity of the proceedings
in the Ancona case with those in the
Lusitania controversy. In both case
observers noted that the foreign of
fice view finally prevailed over thoso
of the admiralty which in each case
was hostile to the contentions of the
United States.
The sinking of the Japanese linei
Yasaka Maru and the French liner
Ville De La Ciotat after the seconci
American note was received in Vienna
are accounted for here on the theory
that the Austrian admiralty, holding
out for its submarine policy, had not
then issued new instructions to the
submarine commanders.

VIENNA. Dec. 31. (Via London)
The following note, dr.ted December 29
in answer to the American govern
ment's demand concerning the sinking
of the Italian steamer Ancona by an
Austrian submarine, has been deliv
ered to Frederick C. Penfield, the
American ambassador:
"In answer to your very esteemed
note Number 4.307 or the 21st instant,
the subscriber has the honor to lay the
following most respectfully before his
excellency, the ambassador of the
United States of America, Frederick
Courthind Penfield:
"The Imperial and royal government
agrees thoroughly with the American
cabinet that tho sacred commandments
of humanity must be observed also in
war. Just as it has hitherto given at
no time and to no person occasion to
doubt its lespect for these command
ments: in like manner also in the
whole course of this war. which pre
sents such pictures of contusion of
moral conceptions, has it given num
erous proofs of humanitarian senti
ments towards enemies as well tis to
ward neutral states, and it was not due
to this government that it was, a short
time ago not in harmony with the
Washington cabinet precisely on a
question which it (the Austro-Hunga-rian
government) in harmony with the
entire public opinion in Austria-Hungary,
regarded as principally a ques
tion of humanity.
"The imperial and royal government
can also substantially concur in the
principle expressed in the very es
teemed note, that private ships, inso
far as they do not flee or offer resist
ance, may not l.e destroyed without the
persons aboard being brought into
rafety.
"The imperial and royal government
is very responsive to the assurance
that the federal government lays value,
upon seeing that the good relations
which happily exist between Austria
Hungary and the United States of
America, remains. It reciprocates tills
assurance most warmly, and is now, as
heretofore, concerned to render these
relations more heartily, so far as lies
in its power.
"Guided by the same spirit of frank
ness as tl.e government of the Union,
the imperial and royal government, al
though it does not find in the note
frequently referred to the answer to all
the legitimate questions submitted by
it. is willing to communicate to the fed

CITIZENS Will ENFORCE Li
ID ORDER IN CLIFTQI
(Special to Tve Republican.)
CLIFTON. Ariz.. Dec. 31. One
hundred citizens of Clifton were to
day sworn in as deputy town mar
shals following a meeting last even
ing of more than two hundred busi
ness men and property owners. This
followed the announcement at the
meeting that law and order would
be preserved in the corporate limits
of Clifton if every citiens was rc-
begun immediately after the receipt of
the fleet report on the sinking of the
Ancona. and hieh was just recently
received.
"The result of this investigation may
be summarized as follows: On No
vember T, 1915, at 11:4H o'clock in the
forenoon, the commander of the sub
marine observed in latitude 3S:40
north, longitude 10:08 east, in foggy
weather, at a distance roundly 3,000
metres and one point to starboard, the
outlines of a large Italian steamer. He
took it at first for a transport steamer
and turned about and fired from his
rear gun a warning shot far from the
vessel.
"Simultaneously he displayed the
signal 'leave the ship.' The steamer
did not stop but rather turned aside
n ml sought to escape. The commander
at firt remained stopped fr some
minutes in order to increase the dis
tance since he feared the steamer had
a stern gun and would tire at the sub
marine with it.
"When the distance had reached
1,500 metres he had the pursuit taken
up with full power and fired from his
forward gun at a decreasing distance
16 shells, among which he observed
three hits.
"During the chase the steamer went
zig-zag' and stopped enly after the
third hit. Thereupon the commander
ceased firing.
"During the flight the steamer had
already, while at full speed, let some
boi'ts with persons in them. fall, which
immediately capsized. After stopping
the steamer began launching bemts.
"From a distance of about 2000
metres the commander saw that six
boats were fi.Ied and rowed hastily
away from the steamer. Another boat
was capsized and floated keel up. The
people held ontf the hanging lines and
to the capsized boat.
"During the further approach of the
submarine the commander saw that a
great panic reigned aboard xand that
he hael to deal with a passenger
steamer, namely the Ancona, from
G?noa. Therefcre he gave the occu
pants of the steamer more time than
was required to leave the ship in life
bo-its.
"At least ten life boats wcr still
aboard, which would have more than
sufficed for the rescue of the persons
still aboard. One of these boats, hung
full of people, half turned out on
davits.
"Since, however, except for this, no
further move was made to lower boats,
the commander decided after a lapse
of forty-five minutes to torped the
(Continued on Page Seven)
quired to devote his entire time to
that end.
On Thursday a Mexican, carrying
a union card, and who was employed
in Clifton, was escorted out of town
I by a committee of the striking min
ers after having refused to contrib
ute 15 per cent, of his earnings to
jtle relief of the strikers. Word of
j this affair coming to the executive
(committee of the Citiens" Projective
league, a meeting was called. When
one hundred deputy, town marshal's
commissions had been issued today, a
committee of the new peace officers
immediately departed in search of
the deported Mexican. He was
brought back to Clifton and told that
, he would be given absolute protec
tion.
It is said that an appeal had pre
viously been made to Sheriff Cash
for protection for the Mexican, but
that that official could not promise
the man would be safe if he re
mained in Clifton.
Negotiations are now going for
ward looking to the end of the strike,
and it is believed that it will be
settled within one week. It is said
the miners are now willing to give
up the Western Federation and that
the mine managers have practically
agreed that in the event such action
is taken, the men will be immedi
ately put to work and in the near
future substantial increases granted
them. These negotiations are going
on by wire with the mine managers,
and several members of the Citipens'
league are also saiel to have per
sonally interviewed the managers at
F.1 Paso.
The Detroit Copper Company as
sessment work is being performed
without interference. Everything is
on let in the district. Thirty-one
United States deputy marshals were
discharged today. It is expected that
fifty more deputy town marshals
will be sworn in on Monday. These
marshals will act without pay and
are pledged to enforce the law re
crardless of faction.

provisional president of China yester
day by the revolutionists according to
a cablegram received here today by a
local Chinese newspaper. The cable
gram also confirmed the report that
the Kiungsi province had joined the

The same message reported that
Yuan Shi Kai had ordered General
Chang King-Yu to proceed to Ngok

The Chinese papers published an ex

Seattle Will Be Largest
"Dry" City in the World
Outside of Russia Bids
Farewell to Alcohol With
Merriment and Noise
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
SF.ATTLE, Dec. 31. Seattle, which,
under the new prohibition law will
be the largest "dry" city in the world
outside of Russia, welcomed the
new year and bade farewell to alco
holic liquor with much noise and
merriment tonight. New Year's eve
is always a time of street carnival,
even without the incentive of a
good-bye drink, and the street crowds
would have been enormous.
Sidewalks on Second avenue, in
the shopping district, were jammed
to the curb with slowly moving
throngs of people, making all the
noise possible. In the roadway au
tomobiles ran back and forth in a
steady parade.
All saloons did a large business ex
cept those which had decided to ad
mit only old customers to lament the
new order of things. It is. estimated
that in the fifteen days ending to
day a million dollars has been spent
in Seattle for liquor wrapped in
packages to be carried home for use
in hte elry period. Persons vvliiv hael
believed that on the farewell night
liquors would be sold for a trifle or
iven away were disappointed when
they learned today that prices of
all liquors except beer had advanced
sharply owing to their scarcity.
When the midnight hour ap
proached the saloons which remained
open were filled to overflowing with
men eager to buy the last drink.
Promptly at the stroke of 12 squads
of policemen entered each place and
cleared the barrooms.
Snow Is Damper
TACO.MA. Wash.. Dec. 31. A lively
fall of snow, making the streets slip
pery for automobiles and chilly for
pedestrians put something of a dam
per on the early New Year's eve
crowds tonight, but all available
space was reserved in hotels and
cafes for the midnight hour, when
the old year and the privilege of
buying intoxicating drinks passed out
together. The retail houses and many
saloons found themselves insufficient-;
ly stocked to meet the final demand
for liquors and a number of these
closed long before the final hour un
der the law.
Fire Cannon in Spokane
SPOKANE. Wash.. Dec. 31. Firing
f a cannon on the roof of a hotel
followed by a chorus of steam whis
tles, the jangling of bells and the
usual merrymaking on the streets
were the arrangements here for sig
nalizing the advent of the New Year
and the exit of John Barleycorn.
Despite previous announcement of
the shortage of lieinors. reservations
at the larger hotels and cafes, made
weeks in advance in many cases by
merrymakers, probably have broken
all records. In several instances ho
tels were compelled to use every inch
of available space on the first two
floors as well as the lobbies and
balconies for tables.
Police were stationed in front of
saloons and cafes to guard against
infractions of the new liquor law. By
sundown most of the liquor dealers
had permanently closed their doors.
Prohibition observers assert that
close to half a million dollars has
been spent here fer liquor in the last
thre-e weeks.
A feature of the advent of prohi
bition is the reporteil shortage of
alcohol in the drug stores.
Closed In Idaho
ROISE. hi., Dec. 31. One hundred
rnd fifty saloons closed their doors in
Idaho at the opening of the New Year
when the most drastic prohibition law
enacted by any state, became effective.
Some eif the bars closed early in the
evening but many remained open until
midnight when what little liquor they
hael left was poured into the sewer.
There were no arrests and little hilar
ity. Most of the liquor in both w hole
sale and retail houses and saloons was
bought up locally several days ago,

felony.

come to the Newcomer
The year 1916 received a noisy and
happy welcome last night in the city
of Phoenix.
Despite the fact that the entry of
the new year was accompanied by
the usual elin and celebration, it was
noted that last year's festivities were
strikingly dissimilar to the ovation
with which the convivial residents of
certain sections of the city greeted
the incoming of 1915, just . one year
ago last night. It was one year ago
that Arizona's saloons passed into
oblivion, and it is remembered that
the celebration em the la-n night of
the old year was one of such magni
tude as to render it difficult to excel
in point of noisy demonstration.
However
Nineteen Hundred and Sixteen re
ceived a royal welcome herre last
night. Many were the watch parties
and other social gatherings which
hael been planned for the purpose eif
watching the dying cycle of time,
gently and graciously eliminate it-se-lf
into the realm of things forgot
ten, and as gently and grRciously
give way to its youthful successor
a successor which, by the way, holds
out the promise of being one of the
most prosperous and fruitful seasons
which this section of the country has
ever experienced. And many were
the toasts eruaffed to 1916. toasts
which carried with them the hoies
that all of the grim elements which
have been jnanifest in the make-up
of the year just passed would be
conspicuously absent in the eiivs to
come, and that all of the bright
spots of the old year would be re
tained and magnified to such an ex
tent that all hearts might univer
sally have cause for rejoicing during
the coming twelvemonth.
Many are those who have been
made happy by the thoughts that the
devastating war which for years
past has been blighting the fair land
to the south, the country at the very
door of Arizona, had been terminated
and that, consequently, the resum
ing of normal business relations be
tween this state and the country that
has long been war-ridden cannot but
have the effect of bringing about a
season of unprecedented prosperity
for Arizona and her neighboring
states.
Everywhere, apparently, last night
joyous crowds gave over the evening
to a period of merry-making. In
countless homes, churches, theaters,
and lodge rooms were held ceremo
nies and celebrations indicating that
the participants not only had for
gotten any dark sides which the dy
ing year may have held for them,
but that they were ready to greet
the new comer with a smile and a
song in hopes that it would mean
the dawning of an era of prosperity
and happiness.
