Comes to U. S. Hot on Heels of
the Ancona Settlement,
President Wilson Begins Imme
diate Quest for Facts.
BLAME DIRECTED TO AUSTRIA
Washington Official Circles Are
Shocked by Sew Tragedy.
American Diplomat May Be
Among Those Lost on Ship.
Washington, Jan. 1. A new and
most serious submarine controversy
today confronted the United States in ;
the torpedoing of the Peninsular &
Oriental liner Persia in the Mediter- !
ranean.
Hot on the heels of the virtual set
tlement of the Ancona case with Aus
tria, the submarining of the Persia, !
with American Consul McNeely, of j
Aden, on board en route to his post, .
renewed tension. I
The state dexmrtment received re-
ports from American Consul Skinner !
at London regarding the sinking of
the Persia and that Consul McNeely
was a passenger and other Americans
were believed to be aboard. Skinner '
said most of the pasesngers were lost.
McNeely's fate was in doubt. If the !
American diplomat met death, the at- :
tack upon the Persia promises to :
make one of the most acute and ser- 1
ious issues which this government has
yet met.
President Interested.
President Wilson and Secretary of :
State Lansing gave the Persia disaster '
their personal attention. The presi
dent was prompaly sent every scrap
of information received at the state
department.
"While officials were openly amazed
at the attack upon the Persia, par
ticularly so soon after the transmis
sion of Austria's reply on the Ancona,
they were disposed to withhold judg
ment and comment until the facts are
more fully ascertained. They espe
cially were interested in whether the
Persia was warned and her passen
gers given opportunity to reach safety.
Shock over the Persia's sinking was
aggravated by -the short lapse of time
sijice th3 Austrian note to this coun
try was delivered. This was handed
to Ambassador Penfield at Vienna on
Wednesday, and within 24 hours of
the attack on the Persia.
From such incomplete information
as was at hand today it was generally
presumed in officials errcles that, as
was the case in the crsis with Ger
many, the Austrian admiralty and the
Vienna foreign office are working at
cross purposes.
Admiralty Not in Line.
It was regarded as a strong possi
bility that while the foreign office is
ready to accede to the contentions of
the United States, the admiralty, bent
on the success of its submarine policy,
has not yet been brought into Uno
There is, however, the added possi
bility that the submarine which sunk
the Persia, being far from home, has
not been instructed in the new policy
of the Austrian government. The de
struction of the Persia, coupled with
the recent sinking of the Japanese
liner Yasaka Maru and the French
liner Ville de La Ciotat, lends strength
in official quarters to both those pos
sibilities. Severance of diplomatic relations,
with all its possibilities, looms up as
one of the eventualities the same as
it did in the case of the Lusitania, the
Arabic and the Ancona Although the
nationality of the submarine which
sunk the Persia remains unesinHoVi
ed, the assumption generally is that it
was an Austrian boat, because Count
von Bernstorff, the German ambassa
dor, recently declared that no Ger
man or Turkish submersible was op
erating in the Mediterranean-

Sew Year's Greeting Teems
With Victory Sentiment.
Can't Conquer Us, He declares
in Thrust at Allies.
London. Jan. 1. The Amsterdam
correspondent of Reuters Telegram
company says that Kmperor William,
according to a dispatch from Berlin,
has sent the foilow.ng New Year's
address to the army, the navy and the
colonial troops:
"Comrades: Another year of se
vere fighting has elapsed. Wherever
a superior number of enemies have
stormed our lines they have failed
before your loyalty and bravery.
Wherever I have sent you into battle
you have gained a glorious victorv.
Thankfully. we remember today
above all. our brethren who joyfully
gave their blood in order to" gain
security for our beloved at home and
imperishable glory for the fatherland.
What they have begun we shall ac
complish with God's gracious help.
"In impotent madness enemies
from the west and east, from the
north and south still seek to deprive
us of all that makes life worth living.
They long ago buried the hope to
conquer us in honest fighting. On
the weight of their masses, on the
starvation of our entire people, on the
influence of their campaign of cal
umniation which is as mischievous as
it is malicious, they believe they can
still reckon. Their plans will not
succeed. Before the spirit or deter
mination which unites the army and
those at home, their hopes will be
miserably disappointed.
"With a will to discharge the duty
to the fatherland to the last breath
and determination to secure victory,
we enter the new year with God for
the protection of the fatherland and
for Germany's greatness. '

Washington, D. C, Jan. 1 . S. L.
Rogers, a well known young colored
man of Ottawa, Kan., has served in
the European war during the past
year as a member of a premier regi
ment of France. Today he lies in a
military hospital at Camp Valbonne,

He has written to his father, Smith
Rogers, at Ottawa, telling of his
plight, and urging that photographs
of his parents be rent him that he
may look at them and think of his
Kansas home b3fore he dies. His
father sent the ' correspondence re
ceived from his son to Congressman
Joseph Taggart with 'he urgent re
quest that he importune Secretary
Lansing, of the state department, to
have young Rogers released from the
service and sent home.
Mr. Taggarc says that everything
is being dore by the state department
to secure the release of young Rogers,
and he has hopes of having him sent
home at some eaily dale, if he is able
to bo removed from the hospital and
is strong enough to make the ocean i
journey.
Young Rogers had a position in
Bordeaux at the time France joined
the allies against Germany and Aus
tria a year ago. Not having sufficient
funds to return home he was forced
into military service by the French
authorities and placed in what is
known as the Premier regiment at
Camp Valbonne, Ain. This regiment
is made up entirely of foreigners.
Through the American consul at Bor

Slim Reception for Ford Party
at Copenhagen.
Warned by Officers "ot to Hold
Public Meeting.
BY CHARLES P. STEWART.
(Written for the State Journal.)
Copenhagen, Jan. 1. The Ford
peace party had some anxious mo
ments last night. For several hours
the delegates were virtually prisoners
guarded by the police to prevent them
from becoming objects of attack by
New Year's eve merrymakers in the
streets.
The delegates were invited to at
tend a banquet in the Royal Shooting
club. They promised United States
Minister Egan they would not leave
while the banquet was in progress. For
three hours the entire delegation was
"interned" and when the banquet was
over they were escorted to their hotels
by the police.
Governor Hanna, of North Dakota,
who was seriously ill in a hospital
here, is better, it was learned today.
The Rev. Charles F. Aked, of San
Francisco, remained in Stockholm, on
the verge of a nervous collapse. Many
of the delegates are suffering from
severe colds.
Only twenty-three persons greeted
the delegates upon their arrival here
yesterday. There was no formal re
ception. Madam Schwimmer, who pre
ceded the party to Copenhagen to
make arrangements, was awaited at
her hotel last night and warned by
the police that she would not be per
mit.d to arrange for public meetings.
Business Manager Plantiff tightened
the reins a little more on delegates ex
penses on the party's arrival here. He
ordered the peace pilgrims to carry
their own baggage. At Christiania
and Stockholm their baggage was car
ried to the hotels at Henry Ford's ex

American Physician Ieelares Austrian
Ancona Xoto Misstates I art.
New York, Jan. 1. Dr. Cecile
Oreil, American physician, survivor of
the Ancona, took issue today with the
Austrian note on the sinking of the
vessel by a submarine.
"The submarine that sank the An
cona fired fifty or more shots at her
instead of sixteen, as stated in the
Austrian note." said Dr. Oreil. "And
every shot was fired aft;r the vessel
had stopped and while efforts were
being made to lower the boats."
Dr. Greil disputed the Austrian gov
ernment's statement regarding the
submarine attack. The submersible
circled the Ancona,' keeping up a
shell fire, she asserted, and disap
peared along the surface without at
tempting to rescue passengers.
The Ancona's boats were not low

to Dr. Greil. She said she heard noth
ing of the warning shots said to have
been fired by the submarine.

Washington, Jan. 1. Kissing,
public drinking cups, cigar cutters
and telephone transmitters are re
sponsible for the widespread epi
demic of grippe throughout the
country. Dr. W. C. Kucker, assist
ant surgeon general in the publio
health service, declared.
Dr. Kucker said the public
health service Is making an in
vestigation of the unusual spread
of the malady. It is spreading:
from the cities to rural districts.
Dr. Kucker said the grippe
usually leaves in its wake some
defect in the ears, eyes or nose.
Its prevalence in a community
also produces enormous economic
loss.
The public health service is pre
paring to combat the malady by
issuing nation wide warnings.
