FONTENOT LEADING IN
RACE FOR SHERIF.
Full Voting Strength of St
Landry Is Expected in
Primary Election on Janu
ary 25th
More active interest is be
ing manifested in the ap
proaching election for sherifi
and assessor than ever before
during the present campaign,
Approximately five thousand
voters have been registered
while it is expected that al
most that amount will have
paid their poll taxes by the
31st.
It is expected that over
three thousand votes will be
cast, which will be the largest
vote ever cast since the par
ish was divided.
The political, fight appears
to be centered on the candi
dates for sheriff and assessor;
it appears, from reports, that
Darius M. Fontenot will come
into town with a majority
varying from two to three
hundred votes and will most
likely secure the ntomination
for sheriff. The three corner
ed race for assessor is proving
not a whit less interesting than
the sheriff fight Supporters of
all three cand ates predict
however that At. L. Andrus
will be in the 1*ad, while the
consensus of ioh seems
divided as to, w ther Charles
Thibodeaux or lbeet Lafleur
will have to fig fit dlt with
Andrus, in the ent: that a
second primary `necessary,
'.-with the chance ariring La
tour.

parish by a n majority,
while it'is conceded that Aus

Prof. Himgs and Hon. John

to the large audience, assem

quent appeals to the taxpayers
in be half of the tax, showing
what a disgrace it would be
" for the property owners of
Opelousas to deny their child

and made an impression on all

No Disturbances Are Recorded
Here on Christmas
Day
WEATHER CONDITIONS
COULD BE NO BETTER
As Usual the Citizens of Ope
lousas Celebrate Christmas
In A Quiet But Joyous
Manner
Christmas was ideal for the
vast majority of the people of
this city and parish, weather
conditions being splendid.
Families were united for the
first time in a year, or possibly
in several years and all gather
ed around the festive board to
do homage in old Creole fash
ion to the anniversary of the
birth of Jesus Christ.
As usual the temperament
of the celebrants was ideal,
and no disturbances were re
corded in the city, either on
-Christmas Eve or Christmas
day itself,; everbody seemed to
be enjtyiin life ilk a gay man
,ner, but alf regarded the ma
jesty of the law.
While many other pcommuni
ties were shocked by,terrible
accidents Opelousas was bless
ed with peace and order, with
no casualties, and everybody
was ready to go back to work
on Monday morning, as usual,
althotigh feeling a little lazy
after taking two holidays.
ST. ILADRY TO GIVE
CAPDEVILLE MAJORITY
Veteran Old Confederate Sol
,lier Will Receive His
Usual Majority Here
Hon. Paul Capdeville, who
is seeking re-election as state
auditor, will receive his usual
majority in old St. Landry
parish at the election on the
25th of this month. Mr. Cap
deville is one of the state's
most trusted officials, having
served as auditor of Louisiana
for the past eight years, being
elected to that office after hav
ing served the city of New Or
leans as its chief ereputive for
a number of years.-:
Mr. Capdeville W a Confed
erate veteran and has always
been a friend.of those noble
men, who so valiantly fought
for a lost cause.
The many friends of Mr.
Capdeville in this parish are
rallying to his support all the
voters possible and it would
not be surprising to see, this
candidate carry St. Landry by
a three to one vote.
Dr. Fred J. Mayer, who is
one of Barret's most valuable
orators and son of the vener
able old lady, was called to
New Orleans, three weeks
ago and has been there ever
since at the bedside of his
mother. In a message to the
Clarion Dr. Mayer reported
that his mother was improving
splendidly.
ent. They were taken down by
a stenographer, but the papers
were misplaced.
The tax advocators are not
lettting grass grow under their
feet; every member of the
various tax committees in
the city are busy inducing the
taxpayers to vote in favor of
the measure and it is predicted
that the tax will be carried.
A large number of taxpayers
are wearing buttons with "I'll
vote for the school tax" in
scribed on it.
The election is nearing and
interest is daily being mani
fested in the election. Very
little opposition is expected to
develop during the last week
of the campaign, as a number
of the large taxpayers in the
district have openly expressed
themselves in favor of the tax,
while it is thought that a vast
majority of the smaller prop
erty owners will not hesitate to
cast their vote for the tax, on
January 11th.

count, despite the fact that
fifty percent more packages
were Sent from and received
in Qpelousas during the Christ
