Great Popular Movement to Re­
buke Greed and Rapacity of
Bitter Opponents.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 30. "The
Danbury hatters have performed a
service of historic importance in the
struggle for industrial freedom," de­
clares the American Federation of
Labor executive council, in a circular
issued to all unions calling on or­
ganized workers to contribute the
wages of an hour's labor, the second
hour of the work day or shift of
January 27, 1916, for the benefit of
despoiled Danbury hatters.
The council's action is under
authority of the American Federation
of Labor convention, held in San
Francisco, last month.
The plight in which the hatters
Danbury, Conn., find themselves
arouses the concern and the sym­
pathy of all the workers as well as
of all the liberty-loving citizens of
America," says the executive council,
which recounts the injustices trade
unions have suffered by reason of
court interpretations of the Sherman
anti-trust law that human beings are
in the same category with commodi­
ties, and are subject to injunction
processes that denied them rights
guaranteed free men and women.
The Battel's' Heroic Straggle.
The hatters' resistance against these
iniquities, together with 'court pro­
cesses financed by the American Fed­
eration of Labor, emphasized these
wrongs and resulted in the passage
by congress of the Clayton amend­
ment to the Sherman anti-trust law
in which it declared that "The labor
power of a human being is not a
commodity or article of commerce."
In addition to this clear declaration
that there is a difference between
labor power and articles of commerce
—to which trurt laws properly apply
—the Clayton amendment limits and
regulates the use of the injunction
writ, and forbids its use for purposes
against which the workers had so
ions' airtl so justly compiaflted.
This establishment of fundamental
rights, this acknowledgment by con­
gress that workers own their labor
power—without interference or direc­
tion by law-maker or judge—is an
epoch in American industrial history.
The men around whom this suc­
cessful battle revolved, however, are
now destitute. Their bank deposits
and homes have been attached to
insure payment of an approximate
$300,000 court award that was made
before the Clayton act was "passed.
Many of the despoiled hatters have
reached an age that they are no
longer able to work, and with their
homes and savings swept from them
they are in a destitute condition as
a result of a fight that ended so
triumphantly for American toiling
men and women.
They Never Faltered.
On this phase of the struggle, the
executive council of the American
Federation of Labor says:
"The Danbury hatters did not fal­
ter in that which they did for the
benefit of all organized labor and for
all the workers of the country. They
did their duty they made the test
and upon them has fallen the conse­
quences of the injustice of the then
existing conditions. All other work­
ers participate in the benefits which
have grown out of the struggle, and
it is but just that they should also
help to relieve the victims, if the
Danbury hatters or the hatters' or­
ganization were left to bear the full
weight of the burden, it would mean
to them great suffering and great
hardship. Every member of organiz­
ed labor is urged to do his duty In
this matter and to bear his share in
the struggle to establish industrial
justice."

An amusing but significant incident
occurred in the national house of rep­
resentatives during the early part of
the session.
When a member asks unanimous
consent to have his remarks ex­
tended in the record, the request is
usually granted without objection.
Every member takes advantage of
this rule and encumbers the record
with detailed and often useless infor­
mation on every subject, from the
desirability of square hen-roosts over
round ones, to the immortality of the
soul.
Asked Unanimous Consent.
Representative Gordon of Ohio re­
cently asked unanimous consent to
have his remarks extended to include
the inaugural address of Thomas Jef­
ferson. Mr. Mann of Illinois opined
it would do the house good to read
the inaugural of Jefferson. Our
quarrel, however, is not with Mr.

INS OIL BURNING
AUXILIARY VESSELS
Secretary Works Out Program to
Provide Carrying Ships for
War Vessels.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 30.—A lot Of
new features have been worked out
by Secretary McAdoo in his new ship­
ping bill—the full text of which will
be introduced in the house after the
holidays. Following are the principal
provisions:
1. The government to build in
American shipyards.
2. The ships to be oil-burning,
and from 3,000 to 10,000 tons dis­
placement.
3. The type to be standardized by
experts to adopt the vessels specially
to use as colliers and navy auxiliaries.
4. Ships to be built both in pri­
vate and in government-owned ship­
yards the latter yards to be addition­
ally equipped.
5. The government to have power
to sell, lease or buy ships.
6. The government to act through
a stock-issuing corporation, and hold
at least 51 per cent of the stock.
7. The sum of $50,000,000 to be
appropriated as a starter.
8. Regulation of marine freight
rates to be attempted through a com­
mission similar to the interstate com­
merce commission.
9. Regulation of foreign ships do­
ing business in American ports
through requiring foreign ships to
secure a license before doing business
here.
To Open Old U. S. Yards.
Perhaps the most important feature
of Secretary McAdoo's plan is the
opening up of the semi-abandoned
government shipyards. Many of these
yards were located in the day of the
wooden cutter and are too far inland,
with too shallow water to float the
great steel fighting ships. The latter
are constructed in private yards where

Retired Naval Official Tells of
How Sailors Were
Treated.
NEW YORK, Dec. 30.—'Writing in
the New York Times, C. S. Stan
worth, a retired United States naval
officer, suggests amendments to the
seamen's act, although he makes the
following acknowledgment of de­
grading conditions American sailors
were forced to accept prior to the
law's passage:
"Sailors have for generations been
outside the law that protects the
ordinary man in his rights, and cus­
tom or common usage, that equally
with law protects us in our relations
to others, has always been invoked
against any attempt to better the
sailor's life.
Dragged aboard ship insensible
from drugs or drink, he is told that
he has signed the. articles for the
voyage, and that two or three
months of his future work has been
paid in advance to the man who
drugged him and lugged him on
board. Ill-clad, ill-fed, hard-worked,
he is at the mercy of the officers of
the ship, whose code generally is
that of brute force, and if he resists
being knocked and kicked about, he
renders himself liable to death for
mutiny. If, when the ship arrives in
port, he attempts to escape from his
slavery, the law throws him in
prison, and then returns him to his
ship, and he pays the expenses."
there was any instrument ever con­
ceived by the brain of man that
should have wide circulation, it is
the inaugural of Jefferson, and in this
instance the "unanimous consent"
rule was put to good use.
•Mr. Fitzgerald of New York, one of
the reactionary Democrats, wanted to
be careful that nothing should get
into the record that might have a
tendency to interfere with thoie who
want to spend a hundred and one
cents out of every dollar paid by the
people, for increased armament and
related purposes.
Didn't Get Unanimous Consent.
Evidently, being unfamiliar, with the
contents of the inaugural of Jeffer­
son, he let it slide through without
his objection.
Soon another member* Mr. Bailey
of Pennsylvania sought to take ad­
vantage of the unaninfous consent
rule. He wanted to include in his
remarks the statement recently given
out by the majority leader, Mr. Kit­
chen. Whereupon Mr. Fitzgerald ob­
jected.

Whole State In Mourning
Over Loss of Chief
Executive.
Governor Winfield Scott
Hammond of Minnesota died
suddenly Thursday morning of
apoplexy superinduced by, a
recent attack of ptomaine pot
soning, at Clinton La., a little
town 30 miles north of Baton
Rouge. He was alone in his
room at the hotel and death
came before physicians could
be summoned.
Governor Hammond was visit­
ing at Clinton where he went for
a few day's rest following his
recent indisposition. Otherwise
he was thought to be in excellent
health. The news of his death
came as. a sudden shock to the
people of Minnesota. There is
general mourning throughout the
state. The people hoped against
hope that there was a mistake in
the first news which came over
the wire. However later .intelli­
gence but confirmed the sad re­
port.
Governor Hammond served as
chief executive of Minnesota one
week less than a year. He was
The price offered for the armory is $50,000. If the,
city gets the cash, the commissioners say they will hol&i.
it in the Permanent Improvement Fund until they acj
cumulate enough to buy the city hall site from the
county.
jj
The fund wiU therefore go to the banks on depositf
for an indefinite period.
The banks pay one per cent interest on city deposits.:
The city therefore would receive an annual increase!
of $500. pf course the idea of the city with its bi
deposits receiving only one per cent from the ban
cent and more from the same banks, look^like
business for the banks.
The city has no legal right to sell the armory on the
installment plan as is proposed by Mayor Prince.
But that is another story.
Who is there in Duluth that does not believe the
armory site will increase in value more than one per
cent a year. If there be such a one he has an argument
in favor of an immediate sale.
But it hardly lies in the mouths of the city com­
missioners or business men to give the city such a black
eye.
However, no one expects the armory to lie idle and
unused. Commissioner Farrell can make use of it to
the extent of a rental value of more than $500 a year.
Some public meetings can be held in it during the com­
ing presidential year that will yield cpnsiderable revenue,
and the dances that have heretofoi^ been held there by
various organizations will not all suddenly cease, or be
transferred to other auditoriums. They pay something.
As a business proposition who can seriously advocate
a sale of such a desirable corner in the business district
right on the eve of a prosperity everyone expects.
Then there is real merit in the claim of the Water
and Light Department that it can make valuable use of
the armory for its business. It undoubtedly could use
at least a part of the armory advantageously for certain
purposes.
So from the business viewpoint there appears to be
every reason not that the armory be sold, but that it
be retained.
While we have first discussed the threatened sale
from a business standpoint, our main interest is in its
possible uses for civic purposes. Some of the commis­
sioners say that the new city hall will have an auditorium
for public meetings, but when are we to have oiir new
city hall?
JINGOES DON'T WANT CONGRESS #I|R TRUTH ABOUT
very remarkable facts in regard to the
present agitation for preparedness.
This is the language used by the
majority leader:

"In the two years of Wilson's ad­

costly by $8,000,000 than the entire
four years of Roo33velt's last term
and practically as large and costly
as the entire four years of Taft's ad­

sorrow by the people of Duluth.
He was well known to a great

Denfeld had taught the governor

Why sell the armory now, if the city hall is to be its
substitute
But the conception of the armory as a citizen's club
hoiue or a public forum, or a great central social center
seeing beyond the vision of somjp of the commissioners.
It is a phase of the subject we do not care to re-^rgue
because we have fully presented it before. We
hav§ visions of that future when governments, particular­
ly municipal governments, shall be in practice as it has
lng been in theory, administrated by the people's
nits tor the benefit of all the people. Those who
of. Jtftat day only have'to open
se who do riot wish to see will never see because'
they will not look.
Who are the forward-looking men in our community
and what is their view on this question?
Watson Moore with his ten years' experience in the
old council and his life-time devotion to disinterested
public service has had the courage to come out in the
open and expose himself to the missiles of those who
are still in their swaddling clothes in municipal ex­
perience.
Let each one who reads this pick that man whom he
respects for. his knowledge and experience in municipal
affairs and ascertain what he thinks of the sale of the
armory at this time.
Unless he has a different experience than the writer,
he will find such men unanimous against a present sale.
This is an important consideration. Such men,are not
interested in such things for selfish purposes. They have
earned their spurs by devoting their time and money
unselfishly to making Duluth a better city in which to
live and rear a family.
They constitute the public sentiment to which public
servants should hearken, and they constitute that public,
the respect of which every commissioner will want to
have when he retires from office.
We suggest to the commissioners that those who
advise them to sell the armory now be asked to give
their answer to these three questions:
First. Do you expect the armory site to be worth,
more, thfin one per cent per annum more than $50,000
between now and when the new city hall is built?
Second. Do you know whether the armory will earn
one per cent per annum on $50,000 if the city keeps it?
Third. Do you favor the development of public
forums, social centers and public markets? If so, where
is a better- location than the old armory?
Fourth. What do those who are not interested in
the proposed purchases or in the banks think about it?

Mr. Kitchen does not take* a fancy
to the "patriots" who havp apparently

whose patriotism is apparently for
-revenue only.
Then, again, Kitchen has a big. fol­
lowing in

the debate is at its height and when

be fur flying in the capltol building

budget and the "cult of preparedness"
which- is sweeping the country was
launched here today with the forma­
tion of the Anti-Militarism Commit­
tee, which has opened local head­
quarters in the Munsey Building and
is said to be in close conference with
the anti-preparedness minority in
both the Senate and the House.
"A committee of Americans has
been formed to protest against the
attempts to stampede this nation into
the adoption of a dangerous program
of military and naval expansion," the
members said. "We believe that no
danger of invasion threatens this
country and that there is no excuse
for hasty, ill-considered action.
"We protest against the diversion
of the public mind from those prep­
arations for world peace based on in­
ternational agreement which it may
be America's privilege to initiate at
the close of the war, and we protest
no less against the effort being made
to divert public funds, sorely needed
in constructive plans for national
health and well-being, into the manu­
facture of engines of. death.
"We are against the 'preparedness'
program, so called, because it is un­
necessary, because it endangers our
most precious institutions and be­
cause, in the last, and true analysis,
no one can measure its cost. Be­
lieving that this statement represents

Famous Mine Leader Takes Ex­

John R. Lawson, international
board member from this district of
the United-Mine Workers of America,
is fully qualified to hold a position
as coal mine boss. Several weeks
ago Lawson took the examination be­
fore the state coal mine examining
board. Monday his examination pa­
pers were figured up and he was de­
clared to have.passed, thus being fit­
ted for a job as practical miner should
he apply for or obtain one.
On the board which examined Law
son were George T. Peart, general
superintendent of the Rocky Moun­
tain Fuel company, and E. H. Weitzel,
general fuel (manager of the Colorado
Fuel & iron company, two men who
have been trying to railroad Lawson
to the penitentiary. Lawson as a
union leader was lined up against
both these men during the recent coal
strike. James Dalrymple, state coal
mine inppectorv and two practical
coal miners, made up the rest of the
examining board.
Lawson did not take the examina­
tion with the idea of immediately
applyinig for work in a coal mine.
It was reported that in various places
the question had been raised as to
whether he was a practical miner
under the rules of the state board.
To set such doubts at rest Lawson
decided to take the examination. His
