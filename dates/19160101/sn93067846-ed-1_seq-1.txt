OHE HOPE FOB WORLD PEACE.
THAT MUST BE POWERFUL IN?
TERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL.
fcoot Thinks That out of War Wrack
May Rise Universal Consciousness
of Baty.
Washington, Dec. 28.?In the real
restraint of nations by powerful in?
ternational tribunals operating under
a definite code of law alone lies hope
,of world peace, Elihu Root, former
secretary of State and senator from
New York, declared in an address
here tonight. Ho was speaking be?
fore a, Joint session of a sub-section
fof 0 international law from the Pan
American Scientific congress and the
American Society of International
Law, of which he is president.
"Th,e Christian church tfas been
urging peace and good will among
men for 19 centuries and still there Is
war" said Mr. Root. "Concerts of
Europe and alliances and ententes and
skillful balance of power all lead ul?
timately to war. Conciliation,- good
Will, love of peace, human sympathy
are all Ineffective without institutions
through which they can act Only
the possitlllty of establishing real re?
straint by law seems to remain to
give effect, to the will of the vast ma?
jority of raa'nkind.
"When this war is ended the civil?
ised world will have to determine
whether what we call international
law Is to be continued as a mere
code of .et iquette or Is to be a real
body of law imposing obligations much
more definite and Inevitable than they
have be/m heretofore. It must be
one thing or the other.
V/ "Vague and uncertain as the future
must be there Is some reason to think
that after the terrible experience
through which civilization is passing
there will be tendency to strengthen
rather than abandon the law of na?
tions. 'Whatever the result may be,
the world will have received a dread?
ful lesson of the evils of war."
Mr. Root then spoke of the sacri?
fices of life and money in the present
War, which he said would produce a
desire to prevent future wars.
"Imperfect and conflicting as is {he
l?ttsJI%^M
for the hope that from, the horrors
of violated law, a stsonger law will
come," he said. "Nor e^n we doubt
that this will be a different world
when peace comes.
J'Some of us believe that the hope
of the world's progress lies in the
spread and perfection of democratic
self government It may be that out
of the wrack and welter of the great
conflict may arise a general conscious?
ness that it is the people who are
to be considered rather than rulers'
ambitions and policies of aggrandise?
ment If that be so, our hopes will
be realized, for autocracy can protect
Itself by arbitrary power, but the peo?
ple can protect themselves only by
the rule of law."
DOUBLE KILLING IN COLUMBIA.
E. E. White Stabs Woman Easily;
Then Cnts Own Throat.
Columbia, Dec. 28.?Edward E.
White, 44 years of age, fatally stabbed
Ada Oeddings, 26, with whom he
boarded, early this morning, and then
killed himself by cutting his own
throat. His pocket knife was used as
the fatal weapon.
.The two people were the only per?
sons in the house. at the time of the
double tragedy, sbut the screams of the

tion of neighbors. The woman ran out
onvthe sireet crying for the police. She
fell and died before she could be given
attention. The man was found dead on
a bed in the house. Both were dressed
in their night clothes. An inquest will
Pe held tonight. White was fireman at
the State capitol building. *Ho was pa?
roled about 18 months ago by former
Qov. Blease after he had served 14
years-of a life sentence for killing a
woman in Columbia in 1899.<
Mrs. Geddings is said to have been
a native of this county and lived in
Sumter a number of years, where she
still has relatives, including her hus?
band, from whom she had been sepa?
rated for several years. Her maiden
name Is said to have been Ada Brown.

WHISKEY REMAINS UNSOLD.
Dispensary Board Does Not Expect to
Dispose of All Stock Defcit End of
Year.
?
Charleston, Dec. 27.?To dispose of
a stock on hand estimated at $75,000
the Charleston county dispensaries
will have to do an ordinary month's
business In the next four days that
remain before the prohibition law suc?
ceeds the dispensary law in South
Carolina. That all of this stock will
be disposed of is not expected by the
Idispensary board, but if the sales are
anything like as heavy for the next
few days as they were for a few days
prior to Christmas, there will be only
a few odds and ends left undisposed
of. To give trade a stimulus and to
save freight on those unsold goods
which the board has the option of re?
turning to the jobber on December
31, the board announced today that
beginning tomorrow morning the dis?
pensaries will sell goods in case lots
at $1.50 less a case than the ordinary
price. The stock on hand will be re?
tailed practically at cost.
An official said this morning: "The
?
dispensary board will make a stren
iuous effort to comply with the letter
of the law and close up its entire af?
fairs on December 31." Clerks and
dispensers will be paid off and their
bonds discharged, and the only build?
ing retained by the board on which it
will have to pay rent will be the dis?
pensary headquarters. On December
20 the dispensaries in Charleston
county had about 8,000 cases of liquor
on hand. This stock has been greatly
reduced by the heavy sales of the last
few days. No accurate figures of the
sales for Christmas have been obtain?
ed, but it is learned that dispensary
No. 5 sold about % 2,500 worth of
liquor in the two days preceding
Christmas and that th*e other dispen?
saries had a correspondingly heavy
business, selling anywhere from $800
to $1,500 Worth. Many M the retaif
depots found that the heavy demand
Christmas Eve cleaned out their stock
and the wholesale dispensary was
kept busy all day delivering large or?
ders.

Vice President Marshall welcomed
the visitors after John Barrett, di?
rector general of the Pan-American

the president of the congress. Sec
/etary Lansing spoke in the name of
the government which had invited
the scientists to meet here, and Am*
bassador Suarez in response empha?
sized the better understanding cre?
ated between the governments of
Latin-America and the United States. ^
Mr. Marshall took the place of
Piesidsnt Wilson, away on his wed?
ding trip. After welcoming the
guests In the name of the nation
the speaker said a word about pre?
paredness to defend the rights of the
Americas:,
"I am one of those men who be?

He added that the idjy^of Patt

ploitation, and that which touched
the nations to the south to their in?
jury touched'also the United States.
The Monroe doctrine was discussed
by Ambassador Suarez, who de?
clared that so long as it was under?

di-tress by South and Central Amer?
ica, but that defined as a derivation
of Pan-Americanism it had become
a "tie of union, a guaranty, a bul?
