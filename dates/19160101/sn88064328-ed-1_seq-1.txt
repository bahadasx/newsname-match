Mr. Parker is concerned, Former
Congressman Pu jo probably is not
far from the truth when he fore
casts that the Iiull Moose candi
date will not get more than fif
teen per cent of the total vote of
the State.
Even, therefore, if the rumors
were true that in due time word
is going down the line in the
Third district for the Progres
sives to enter the primary and
vote for Mr. Barret on the theory
that he would be a less formid
able candidate in April than Mr.
Pleasant, the -ultimate result
could not be affected.
But in the interest of decent
politics we hope that the attitude
of the Iberia Progressives is de
stined to be the eventuful attitude
of everv self-respecting citizen in
the campaign. Let every man
have perfect freedom^ choice as
between the Democratic and Pro
pressive candidates. But let no
man persuade himself that he can
honestly serve in two political
camps in the same campaign.
Otherwise we shall never have
two strong white parties in Lou
isiana which Mr. Parker professes
to desire to see. Instead we slioll
have a state filled with mongrels
aud the tone of our politics will
constantly grow worse instead of
better.
In the meantime the columns

Constipation and Indigestion.

Washington, Dec. 29.—Mr. Sid
ney Bradford of Avery Island,
has been appointed to the mem
bership committee of the Navy
League of the United States and
will help to represent that organ
ization in his district in the active,
&
aggressive campaign which it is
carrying on in all parts of the
country in behalf of adequate
preparedness against invasion and
disaster. He will co-operate with
the members of the Navy
Leagre's state committee for Lor

Waldo of New Orleans is chair
man and will lend his energetic
and enthusiastic support to the
work undertaken to consolidate
and organize the overwhelmin
sentiment of thinking people of
that state in behalf of measures of
adequate preparedness. A special

ADVERTISING THAT HUMIS
Truthful advertising abroad of
Louisiana lands is always desir
able. But at different times we
have called attention to the in
jury inflicted upon the State
where there is exaggeration or
misrepresentation in such adver
tising.
In that connection the Lake
Charles American-Press is de
manding action by commercial
bodies to put a stop to the ex
ploitation of certain Calcasieu
lands the value of which, it
claims, is being absurdly magni
fied' These lands are located in
the vicinity of the Union Sul
phur Company's property,
whose production of sulphur
amounts to millions of dollars
annually, and the bait offered to
prospective is that drilling on
these lands will probably dis
close similar deposits of sulphur.
The American-Press claim
that these lands are divided into
lots and offered for sale at the
rate of $400 an acre, whereas
they never commanded an
average price of $15 an acre, and
that all the evidence is to the
effect that thej contain no sul
phur,
It points out that the unique,
deposits being mined by the
Union Sulphur Company is not
found over an aeraof four thous
and acres, as represented in
some of the literature seat out
but is contained within forty
acres, enclosed by four thous
and acres of land worth buta few
dollars an acre. The company
itself has tested from time to
time the four thousand acres,
but has never found sulphur any
where except on the forty-acre
tract, thus demonstrating that
the deposits it own constitute a
geographical freak unknown at
any other spot on earth.
It may be that the American
Press itself has been imposed
upon. The sulphur company
naturally would have a selfish
interest in discouraging pro
specting in the vicinity of its
holdings if it had reason to bit:
lieve that its plot was not a get
logical freak. But, "be that äs* it^
may the American Press is jus
tified in protesting against the
advertising abroad of the pos
sibilities of the lands if there is
no ground for the
hopes held out to those who are
asked to buy
Louisiana has suffered consid
erably from the operations of
land syndicate happily very few,
who have held out glittering
promises to home seekers which
could not be fulfilled. Other
States have had similar exper
iences. Any movement to re
strict such misrepresentations
ought to be encourged So
much can truthfully be said of
the great fertility of our lands
and even of our mineral resour
ces that there is no need to pro
pagate falsehoods concerning
them.—States.
Bad Cold Quickly Broken Up.
Mrs. Martha Wilcox, Gowanda,
N. Y. writes : "I first used Cham
berlain's Cough Remedy about
eight years ago. At that time I
had a hard cold and coughed
most of the time. It proved to be
just what I needed. It broke up
the cold in a few days, and the
cough entirely disappeared. I
have told many of my friends of
the good I received through us
ing this medicine, and all who
have used it speak of jt in the
highest terms."' Obtainable ev

STRONG IX
LOUISIANA.
NORTII
The Parker movement, out
side the Third district, will not
opposition to the
Democracy in the coming elec
tion, is the opinion of former
Congressman A. P. Pu jo, of
Lake Charles, who was in New
Orleans Tuesday on professional
business.
"There is little interest in the
state campaign in my section,"
said Mr. Pujo, "but I look for
normal vote in the Democratic
primary.
"In the general election Mr.
Parker representing the Pn>
gressive party, will not poll over
fifteen per cent of the vote and I
think that will be the average for
the whole state outside of New
Orleans. Mr. Parker's chief
strength will be in Third district
and I doubt if he will get over
7,000 votes there. The Demo
cratic party will win in its usual
victory in April."
Mr. Pujo has been taking
active part in the campaign. It
is no secret that, on purely per
sonal grounds, he will cast his
vote for Mr.Barret; but he is op
posed to state wide prohibition,
and hence not in sympathy with
Mr. Barret's issue.
Burke Strong in
His Section.
Asked about the race for lieu
tenant governor he said:
"Mr. Burke of Iberia has a
strong following in my section.
People believe he is a young
man of marked ability and high
character, with some ligislative
experiences and a lively interest
in public affairs, and that he
would fill the office most credi
tably. Moreover he has made
friends by his sturdy Democracy
and his Democratic activities in
his district where to take an ag
gressive stand for the Democra
tic party is not only to invite
political but to some extent pro
Sessional and business ostracism.
Women of Sedentary Habits :
Women who get but little exer
cise are likely to be troubled with
constipation and indigestion and
find Chamberlain's Tablets
highly beneficial. Not so good as
a three or four mile walk every
day, but Very much better than
to allow the bowels to remain in a
constipated condition. They are
easy and pleasant to take and
most agreeable in effect. Obtain

FOUR RULES FOR FARM
RENTERS.
1. Stick to the farm. It's
better even for the tenant than
the town or the factory, and cer
tainly better for his children
whose future should be dearest
of all things to him.
2. Aim sometime to be a land
owner. If you are 21 or under,
aim to be one by the time you
are 35. If you are already too
old to realize this, aim at own
ership not over ten years from
now.
3. Resolve to become a land
owner by the two roads: first,
making; second, saving. Unless
you make yourself a progressive,
thrifty, economical farmer new,
you would not be likely to keep a
farm of your own if you had it.
Good farming and careful saving
are therefore both tne way to
get a farm and the way to keep
it after you get it.
4. Don.t try to be a land
owner too soon. That is to say.
don't buy a farm until you can
equip it reasonably well. Aim
first to get good tools, good cat
tle, and good horses and mules
while you are a renter, and then
let the land come later, instead
of trying for the land first and
equipment later.—-The Progres
sive Farmer
The Oist of It.
"Last December I had a very
severe cold and was nearly down
sick in bed. I bought two bot
tles of Chamberlain's Couffh Rem
edy snd it was only a very few
days "until I was completely re
stored to health," writes O J.
Metcalf. Weatherby, Mo. If yon

That the boy on the farm
should become his father's part
ner in business, was the key
note of the address of Prof. VV.
E. Vaplon, who has charge of
junior extension work for Colo
rado Agricultural College. If
the boy is permitted to pay his
way on the farm, renting an acre
of ground from his father, and
getting his full share of the re
turn from the acre, it will give
the boy an active interest that
often will decide his future in
favor of the farm. The same is
of the girl whose mother is far
sighted enough to make the
daughter a real partner in gar
dening and earning vocations.

for cooperation to begin was the

One trouble with us in the
South is that we think too much
about a bank as being a place to
get money out of. instead of as a
place to put money in; and it
would be better, as Dr. Butler

that it is ' a rural banking sys
