Tlie philosopher who writes these
paragraphs recently came in contact
with another colossal mind, of equal
magnitude and equally peculiar. It
may De that succeeding paragraphs
w I!i be tiuctured Lhereby. .
o -
Two tilings are absolutely certain
death, and the fact that nobody takes
anything away with him.
o
You may be smart enough to get
ahead of the butcher, the baker and
candlestick maker, but you can't run
a bill with the devil and beat him
out of it.
-. o
Old Si takes note that when folks
eat cranberries they alw ays have some
thing extra good to go along with
tne berries. It is well.
They say that the grippe is not te
be sneezed at, but how is the poor
victim to help himself.
o
- Speaking of films, the shadow never
quite equals the substance, although
tbe shadow may be both beautiful
and useful, because there is no appeal
to the ear. Similarly, canned music
cannot equal tiie original, because
there is no appeal to the eye. In the
one cae we cannot hear the actor
and in the other we cannot see the
performer. Each of the senses,
seeing and hearing, needs the help of
the other to give the highest degree
of satisfaction. "
o
If people still heed the old admon
ition, "stuff a cold and start a feve1-";
there must be a lot of heavy feeding
going on just now, judging by the
prevalence of colds and grippe.
It may be too late to advise people
to do their Christmas shoppsng early,
but it is not too late to give an
example of what may happen during
the rush and hurry of the Christ
mas mails. A Chrismas letter was
mailed at Portland. Michigan, Decem
ber 22, and was rather plainly address
ed to "Wilson, . Kansas.'' It was
Missent to Wilmore, Kans. where it
arrived on Christmas day. From
Wilmore it was "Missent to Wet more,
Kans." arrived on the27th. At Wet
more, tbe cleric decided that the ad
dress was "Proably Wilson," where
it arrived on the 28th, Instead of tbe
24th. as intended, and finally caught
the addressee at Wa-Keeney on tbe
2iHh.
But we should not be too severe . in
criticism of the mail clerics. It is
very easy for us to read the name and
address of a friend whosa location is
already well to us. It is all suggested
by prior information. - It is different
with tbe clerk. He must be governed
by what he sees suddenly thrust be
fore him and be has no time to de
cipher riddles.

MARKET REPORT';-
, Kansas City Stock X-ards, Djc. 2i, '15
Cattle receipts today were 7000 head,
light for Tuesday, and it was expect
ed at the start that the favorable
situation for sellers w hich has existed
for the last week would hold good.
i Uut the market proved to be barely
capaoie of holding steady, and late
sales of beef steers were 10 to 15 cents
lower than yesterday. The best cattle
here sold at $S. to $8.25, yearlings at
$3, bulk of the beef steers at $7 to $7. 75
a few up to 86.75, heifers mostly S6.25
to $7, fancy heifers scarce, but quot
able at $3 to $9, bulls $4.75 $5.60,
veal calves $3 to $9. Stockers and
feeders are a shade stronger this week,
most of the stock steers at o.8o to
$6.80, some choice feeders weighing
11C0 lbs at $3.10 this week, a few good
feeders around $7.50, .plain feeders
$6.25 to $7. Beef cattle have had a
healthy tone fcr a week, -which has
revived the feeder demand, and the
market has been gradually getting
on a basis -satisfactory to feeders.
Good feeding weather so far this sea
son iias also helped to make results
favorable. The weakness today, in
the face of a veryy light total for the
week, makes the prospect for the
January beef cattle market somewhat
of a question again.
Hog receipts were light today 10,000
head, and the market openned to 10
higher, top $0.75. Weakness develop
ed defore the close, and bulk of sales
rangad from $6.30 to $6.70, 5tol0cents
above yesterday. Totai hog supply at
Kansas City fcr 1915 will be 2,525,000
head, an increase of 250,000 over 1914.
Since the first , of December packers
have shipped many trains or hogs
from St Paul and Sioux City to Kan
sas City for slaughter, because of the
fv'"ge capacity of the plants here,
winch has not been taxed by tug win
ter supply of hogs here so far this
season.
Lambs and yearlings sold a quarter
higher today, following similar ad
vance yesterday. Choice Colorado fed
lambs sold at $9.25 to $9.40, Kansas
fed Western $9.35, Colorado fed year
lings at $3.25, the latter w eighing 85
lbs. Sheep do not show such a sen
sational - advance, though they are
higher, choice ewes quotable at $6 to
$6.25, wethers $6.35 to $6.60. JNot
many feeding lambs are available, al
though some are sorted out of shipment
of fed stock, at $3 to $-3.40. Receipts
are moderate, 6000 yesterday, and tne
same number todav. -

best?
