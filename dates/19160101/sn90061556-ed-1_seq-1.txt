Fifty Years
of Masonry
By Joe E. Hcrrlford, P. M.
N , CHAPTEIl 14,
In 1887 the Most Worshipful Grand
Lodge convened in Omaha, as per ap
pointment, and n large delegation was
present. Many of theliermanent mem
bers of the body had. grown to look
upon this meeting as an annual vaca
tion from their various labors and the
prospect of a visit to the beautiful
Nebraska metropolis offered an excep
tional attraction,
Looking over the list of Grand offi
cers wo note the absence of Grand
Treasurer Bruce, who for many years
had been custodian of the Grand
Lodge funds. His place was filled by
Dr. J. C. C. Owens temporarily. It ap
pears from the records and from ex
pressions made by the Grand Master
during his annual address upon the
first day, that Grand Treasurer Bruce
had become financially Involved and
that there was a shortage in tho funds
of nearly fifteen hundred dollars a
considerable sum for tho Grand Lodge
to lose at that time. S.o there was
naturally much concern over the con
dition. Bonds made in lho.se days
-were usually signed by private friends
of officers and though they looked like
the Rock of Gibraltar upon paper,
were usually about . as sacred as ft
treaty of neace btjjtw.ecn two' Mexican
' states. '"If the integrity o'f "a grand-of
ficer were ever questioned or if any
objections wero made to his methods
of accounting, his friends always
came forward and made such a dem
onstration that the. objectors were
soon cowed down and discredited. Ac1
tual fre speech had never been an as
set of a member of the Grand Lodge,
especially if he hoped to ever receive
any favorable consideration from
those In authority. To have much to
say about thing was the surest and
easiest way to kill one's self so far as
concerned the politics j of the Grand
Lodge. True, there were always those
who had well grounded reasons for ob
jecting to certain prevailing condi
tions and customs, but these were us
ually discussed "in a low breath" and
with the utmost discretion. Young
masters coming up with a desire to
know things were quickly advised by
the older members to go' slow and take
things as they were. Everything was
&11 right. Tho young members just
did not understand, That was all.
Notwithstanding the distress which
the shortage of the Grand Treasurer
entailed no one thought of suggesting
that the secretaryship of the Relief
Department should be safeguarded in
time or that the Grand Lodge ought to
have any closer check upon that De
partment. Everything was all right-
except with Bruce. '
In hi3 annual address, the Grand
Master, who ought to have known the
real state of affairs, merely hinted at
matters and suggested, a new lock for
the door. Ho probably desired to keep
down excitement as much bb possible.
'It was all quite vague to the brethren.
Ono of the felicities of this mooting
was the announcement that the "Iowa
Trouble" had been settled. The rival
grand lodges had met in convention,
dissolved themselves, aud formed an
entirely new bQdy, thus ending a long
-'period of unnecessary and Unfraternai
; strife. ,
; Grand Master Pelham discussed the
question of recognition ' from white
grand lodges with something 6f dis
couragement.. He properly concluded
that tho whole thing hinged upon the
point of race prejudice and very im
properly advised that the agitation be
kept up until' the desired end was ac
complished, The committee, on Grand
Master's address reporting under tho
.leadership of the brilliant Dr. M. O.
"Ricketts. ordered the Grand Master to
sound tho alarm upon the door of
every grand lodge in the world. The
Grand Master was not ordered to
stand by the dooruntll It were opened.
From this Viewpoint it appears that
the Grand Lodge bi Missouri should
ha,ve devoted more of its energy to &
businesslike1 control of its own affairs
and less to that of begging rpcognl-
tion from biased white men who wero
so, steeped' In tho 'dye of caste that
thev would not see the truth of the
' situation. To properly bond its finan
cial officers and secure tho funds con
tributed by the hardworking crafts
men was of far more importance than
Jthe shallow smiles of white grand
'lodges ami all, that the amllea carried
vf ith them.
At tbjs meeting It was definitely de
cided to permanently locate the grand
was said about the Grand Lodge Li
brary, i
On the afternoon of tho second day
the elections wero held. Brother Pel
ham, having set aside all competitors,
was re-elected unanimously, Brother
Win. II, Jones was chosen Grand
Treasurer, and Brother Matthew O.
Rtcketts was made Junior Grand War
don. Hannibal won the next meeting
alter an exciting chase for the plum.
TOOJNOISY.
Did you ever notice how noisy a
certain class of our people are? It
just seems to be natural for some to
be noisy. This class talks loud on the
streets, In tbe street cars or wherever
they may be. Of course, the undls
crimlnatlng public finds It quite con
venient to put-us all In the same class
and to say we are all noisy. This, of
course, is not true, but the noisy, loud
mouthed fellows make so much noise
and there are so many of them, as
compared with tho more refined class,
that the impression prevails thatall
Negroes areTioIsy.
Now, some of you noisy fellows are
going to read thl3. 'Of course you
are. You don't think you nre harming
anybody by your noise, and you doubt
less think that it is your own noise
and that it is therefore nobody's busi
ness how much noise you make.
Perhaps you are wholly unconsci
ous of the fact that you are noisy.
But if you think your noisiness harms
nobody you are wrong. For in the
first place It harms you. It puts you
down as an ignorant or clownish chap.
If. may keep you out of n good job.
And then It harms the' race to which
you belong. In the eyes of many the
wholo" race Is judged and condemned
by your noisiness and clownishness
and through you 'certain privileges
may be restricted or denied. True,
people may only want an excuse to
deny these privileges, and you furnish
that excuse. Did you ever think of it
In that light?
Empty wagons are noisy. Loaded
wagons make very little noise. Ever
notice it? Don't be satisfied to be an
empty wagon.
Next time you are in a bunch of
fellows notice how noisy they are and
see It you cannot be a little less noisy
yourself and Induce the other fellows
to be a'JItUs Ices inolsydo;.;
" You owe lb to yourself You owe it
to your race.. Lot us correct our
faults whatever they may be, "and be
ing too noisy and boisterous is' one of
these faults. Monitor.

TO EARN SOME
c
Pullman Raises Wages.
What the Wage Increase Means to
Kansas City.
More than any other great railroad
center, Kansas City will benefit by the
10 per cent Increase In wages to con
ductors and porters, announced by
the Pullman company to go Into effect
today. The Increase is brought about
through the efforts of the commission
on Industrial relations.
Kansas City is the greatest operat
ing center of the Pullman incern.
More Pullman cars are handled here
than at any other point. Kansas City
Is headquarters for more Pullman con
ductors and porters than is any other
city. A total of 600 conductors and
porters live here.
The Increase In wage scale will
mean an additional annual expendi
ture on the part of the Pullman com
pany, throughout Its entire system In
the United States and Canada, of $000,-
000, of which sum about $3,000 a month
or $35,000 a year, will be spent here.
To the conductors' payroll in Kansas
City will be added approximately
$1,500 a month, and to the porters'
salary list about $1,350, according to
J. B. Elliott, district superintendent
of the Pullman company.
Most of this additional money paid
out by the Pullman company to Its
conductors and porters In the Kansas
City district will be spent here. For
150 conductors and 350 porters live
in Kansas City. In addition, there are
those who operate in and out of Kan
sas City and do their marketing and
buying here.
Of the 2,500 Pullman conductors in
the United States, 2G0 or more than
10 per cent, work in the Kansas City
district; while as for the 0,500 porters,
450 or better than S per cent, make
this their headquarters.
The present salary scale is deter
mined by length of service. Pullman
conductors are paid from $77 to $125
a month, and porters from $30 to $50.
Salaries after January 1 will range
from $85 to $137.50 a month for con
ductors, and from $33 to $55 a month
for porters. That will mean Increased
prosperity to COO Kansas City fami
lies. Statistics for 1915 have not yet been
completed, but local Pullman company
agents say they will show a big in
crease over 1914, with Kansas City
still In the lead as an operating cen
ter. For 1914, tho figures showed that
Kansas City handled, on an average,
103 departing cars a day.

A Mothers Farewell.
'So you're coins awav. mv rinrltnrr hnr.
You've come for your last goodfiye."
You're robbing your poor old mother.
son,
So excuse me, my boy, if I cry.
Just think how I've watched over you
From a babe to the man you are,
Doing the best that I could, myboy.
For you were my guiding star.
I've kept you pure and sweet and
clean,
I've taught you the nobler thlncs.
And I've tried, my boy, to show to you
Tbe reward that happiness brings.
And boy, you too, mave been true to
me,
So that some of the boys made fun
And said you were tied to my apron
string Because what I asked you was done.
And I've made your home life happy,
Made home a place you would know
You could always have your own way
In.
And, oh boy, I cry to see you go.
And listen to a mother's warning,
Just listen, my boy, while I say
You'll meet evil and sin continually.
But fight it while you are away.
Be strong like the man I've made you,
Keep your heart and soul sin free,
And In the hardest of all temptations
My boy, think you about me.
Here, take this little old picture,
Just wear It right next to your heart,
And whenever you look at it, my boy,
You may know we'ro not far apart.
For, though today you leave me,
My heart goes along with you.
And a mother's heart is wonderful,
boy,
It will help you be good and true.
That's all, I guess, but tho blessing
And wishes for success and cheer;
God bless you, boy, and keep you,
As I've kept you for many a year.
Kiss me farewell a kiss like yougavo
yuen. auer we a climbed the stairs,
You'd throw your arms around and
kiss me
After I'd heard you say your prayers.
And remember your dear old mother,
Remember she'l) stand by you,
And though you're far away, ray boy.
Say your prayers for your mother, too,
So you're going away, my darling boy,
And this is our last goodbye?
Come kiss me once, just onqe aguln,
Then leave mo and let mo cry.
