KEEP COOL
an buy the kind of coa that wili
keep you cool with the fewest
tripr. to the cellar. Try our coal
this year. You'll find it goes so
much farther than ordinray fuel
that when warm weather comes
around you'll have a nice little
pile left to start the next Beason
on . That proves it's coal economy
to buy here.

I heatrica 1 Br<*adway,
which mak-s and unmakes
its stars in a night. i> jn.-t
n<»\v acclaiming more warm
ly, loudly and persistently
than any other the name of'
G.adys Hanson. A short
while ago a play called "The)
Ware Case. \va> presented)
at the Maxine Llliott theater,
It came with a record of
great success in London,
where Gerald Du Maurier
starred, in it. The star in
this country is Lou Tellegen.
and. like the English actor,
he. too. strongly scored.
The New York critics, how
ever. found little in the play
to enthuse about—that is.
little except the notably fine
performance of Miss Hanson.
As with one mind, they
voiced tin ir praise in the
most positive terms, with the
result that this beautiful
"girl from Georgia*' was
forthwith ' featured" with
the leading actor of the
play, placing her on the di
rect route to stardom. Gladys
Hanson is the daughter of
Col. Peyton Harrison Snook
of Atlanta, and has been on
the stage only seven years.
At the very start her native
charm and good breeding
seemed to assure success, for.
with the exception of her
first play, she has never en
acted anything but leading
roles. She was leading wo
man with E. H. Sotheru and
Kyrie Bellew, and her work
in many Belasco and Froham
productions have kept her at
the very front of America's
leading women. She has
been featured as a star by
the Famous Players, Lubin
and Universal companies.
Her latest picture "The
Primrose Path" has just been
released.
OI)I) BITS OF NEWS.
Sheboygan, Wis.,—Gert
rude Grass' particular claim
to beauty were her long,
golden tresses. In a dream
recently, she arose from her
bed, obtained a pair of scis
sors and clipped her head as
bald as an egg.
Elkins, W. Va —Wild
hogs rushed down the moun
tains and into the home of
Sanford Phillips in the foot
hills. where they attacked
Phillips' two-year old son.
The child, frightened, rush
ed to the corner where a mir
ror hung. When the hogs
saw their reflections in the
mirror, they became panic
stricken and rushed back to
the hills, leaving the child
uninjured.
Hillsdale, Mich.—At a
social in tin* Adams school
house in Cambria township,
the women stuck their toes
through in a sheet, and men
bought them for the evening.
The sale netted the school
$7.80.
Berwick, Eng.—Lightn
ing struck the wedding ring
on the finger of Mrs. Mason
of Castlegate, taking a piece
out tiie ring but leaving the
finger uninjured.
