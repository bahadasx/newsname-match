Sugar In Congress.
Overconfidence is fatal to many
causes. The fact is one Louisiana
sugar planters ought not to over
y look.
.Because President Wilson and
ecretary McAdoo have recom
mended to Congress suspension
of the free sugar schedule, they'
have jumped to the conclusion
that the condition of the treasury
compelled them to do so, and sus
pension is assured..
But the planters ought not to
count their chickens before they
are hatched. One of the most
foolish mistakes they could make
would be to persist in throwing
rocks at Democracy when at this
stage of the game Democracy
alone can help then.,
Of much pertinedece is the fol
lowing warning which we take
from the Philade'phia Record,
one of the few great Democratic
newspapers of the East:
The Government has to have
rmvem , andm isaris a tempting

tinunace of the present duty
would yield about $42,000,00,
but the deople would pay a great
deal mone, because they would

d while only the tax on the im
ported sugar would go to the
;Govrpmet, and a few. millions
of tht would be repaid in draw

par all the sugar they use, it
be good Democratic doet
fine and good political economy

pay would go into the

MUCH ADO ABOUT
NOTHING.
In the last issue of the ever
infahno'us L'Observateur we notic
ed a big harangue concerning an
insignificant and natural Mistake
made at the sheriff's office in is
suing the poll tax receipt of Mr.
Paul Duhe of the 5th. ward. The
Chief Deputy, Mr. Dumez, being
accustomed to write the name
Paul Berthelot perhaps a hundred
times a day in performing the
duties of his office, inadvertently
wrote the sheriff's name on the
poll tax receipt of Mr. Duh6.
However, the stub on the Poll
Tax book, from which the poll
tax list is made, showed plainly
and correctly that Mr. Paul Duh6
had paid his poll tax and there
fore that gentleman could not
possibly have been deprived of
his right to vote on that score
even though his receipt was er
roneously issued.
L'Observateur has the usual
audacity and effrontery to style
this natural and minor mistake
as "a nefarious trick" to rob Mr.
Duhe of his right to vote and
even goes so far as to suggest
that the Hart Faction should
place a watchman in the sheriff's
office to superintend the Is
suanceof poll tax receipts. If Mr
L'Observateur had used his head
in this matter he would have
arrived at the sane and inevit
able conclusion that such insigni
ficant slips cannot work to the
detriment f any poll tax payer,
for the reason abovegiven.
If suggestions are in order, we C,
would suggest that Mr. L'Obser- ~I
vateur place a watchman in the
office of the Registrar of Voters .
where one is needed to see that no 0
registration is done by proxy and n
that the registration books are
closed even to the Hart adherents P'
thirty days prior to election as N
the law provides. Such practices N
can properly be called "nefarious'
and ought to prove valuable edito- I t
,ial food for our virtuous con- in
tiemporary. T
Do not fear, gentle reader, you fc
will never see L'Observateur de
cry any violations of the law, es- C
pecially when committed by its le
political HERO and his worship
pers. Nothin' wrong or illegal can 3
emanate from the Hart Faction, IR
in the opinion of L'Observateur.
In an effort to poison th'e minds di
of the people aud discredit the 1
efficient Berthelot administration
our reformer-editor always notic
es the microscopic defects of his Ila
political enemies and fails tolh
notice orrather disregards com
pletely the glaringly wicked and
illegal practices among the mem- t<
bers of his own clan. I
1915 -- 191t
As we approach the new year
we review the events and expe
riences throtigh which we have
passed, and resolve to profit by
them during the coming 'year.
If 1915 has brought ruin--or
sorrow and hung crepe on our
doors, the new year will bring us
the leaves of healing and we are,
all therefore glad to part with I
the one and welcome the other.
The new year will be what we.
make it, so far as our individual
livesareconcerned and if we re
solve to be happy in an unselfish 1
way, we are taking the firstroad
to happiness.
. The Meschacdbd is glad once
more to wish its readers and
friends a happy and prosperous .

Republican National
Committee.
The national committee of
the Republican party netat
Washington this week and
chose Chicago, June 7,1916
as the place and date for the
assembling of the Republican
nominating convention
Three other cities were also
applicants for thee, vention
but Chicago carried off the
plum by 31 votes, San Fran
cisco receiving 13, St. Lonis
7 and Ph'ladelph'ia 2. It has
been the in variable custom
in the past for the party
out of power to hold its na
tional c-onvention after that
of the "'ins," so that the po
sition and claims of the lat
ter could be better criticised
and attacked, but it was the
sentiment of the majority ol
the Republican corunittee
that the procedure should be
reversed in the coming cam
paign and that the Republi
cans should take the initia- I
tive and make an aggressive
rather. than a defensive ftght
Irrepressible Walter Cohen
of Louisiana was on hand
with a protest against the
freezing out of the colored
man' and brother from the
Republican organization in
this state. but the committee
unanimGnsly sustained the
selection of Victor Lois-l as
the Louisiana member and
no committeeman would
present a resolution prepar
ed by Cohen calling for th
appointment (f a committet
of three to investigate Louis
iana conditions.
