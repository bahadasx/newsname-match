Barrett the Right Man.
Minden, La,, Dec. 15, 1915.
I notice that the Shreveport
Times is attempting to make
capital of the fact that the Meth
odist Episcopal Church South in
their annual Conference at Mans
field, and the Baptist church, at
their Convention at DeRidder,
did not endorse Mr. Barrett's
candidacy for Governor specific
ally. Now, I see but little con
solation in this for the support
ers of Mr. Pleasant, since the
Methodist Conference and the
Baptist Convention both endors
ed the action of the Anti-Saloon
League and re-elected Dr. A. W.
Turner to the same position in
the League. Dr. Turner is at
the head of the Anti-Saloon
League in Louisiana, and he and
the League are supporting Mr.
Barrett. If this is not practic
ally an endorsement of Mr. Bar
rett by both the M. E. Confer
ence and the Baptist Convention,
what could be called an endorse
ment? It is not the province of t
the different churches to enter I
politics and it is not their inten- t
tion or desire to do so, but they a
do propose to uphold all moral a
issues, and there is no question p
but that Mr. Barrett represents a
the moral side of this issue. n
There is no denying the fact that ii
the liquor question has become t]
an issue in all of the Southern a
States, and many of the North
tates, and will continue so ti
until t ufacture and sale tl
of liquor is pro 1ii in every p
State in the Union. Thei~ o is
,dodging the question and the dis- T1
tillers and brewers see the hand- of
writing upon the wall. at
What we want in Louisiana in ai
all public offices are men who will se
uphold any legislative act against th
the whiskey traffic, and men who vt
will come out boldly and denounce
the damnable business from start is
to finish. I believe in fighting it do
from Justice precinct to Nation sa
wide, and the sooner it is wiped w
out of existence the better it will w
be for our young men, our daugh- or
ters and the whole country. an
So far as Mr. Barrett being a ch
recent convert to prohibition is pr
concerned makes no difference th
with me. He is a convert all the m,
same and can't well "go back" -
if he wanted to. The old adage
that "wise men change their
minds, but fools never do," is
very fitting in this instance.
The liquor element is pleased
with Mr. Pleasant's position in
the matter and are supporting fly
him almost to a man. This of m
Itself is sufficient evidence for o'
me to oppose him in this race for fla
Governor. Personally I know the
neither of the men making the to
race, but from what I can gather th(
through the newspapers andbu
judging from the support given th
Mr. Barrett by the majority of em
the moral element throughout the bal
country, I am for Mr. Barrett, i
and all who profess to be prohi- 1
bitionists, or want to see the liq- ca
nor traffic wiped off the face of ha(
the earth, should be for him. gr

Who Pay's the Printer's Bill.
5. There is a prevailing opinion
ort among farmers and the people in
ike general who are not in business
th- that the money a merchant pays
in for advertising is added to the
ns- price of goods, and that the cus
at tomer is the one who really pays
er, the merchant's advertising bills.
t's Many persons express their opin
Sc- ion freely along this line, which
n- shows they have never given it a
rt- moment of serious thought.
he For instance, we will take a
he merchant in a neighboring town
rs- for illustration. He had nevei
on believed in advertising. He was
N'. the owner of a men's furnishing
in store, and had been selling on an t
at average of three suits of clothes t
on a day without advertising; and c
d the profit on each suit was $3. c
r. This made a profit of $9 a day or s
c- $54 a week. Not long ago he de- 1
.r- cided to advertise for one month, s
r- and the month's advertising cost t
n, $15. He advertised to sell each e
e- suit for $1 less than the regular d
3f price. This made a profit of only i;
er $2 on each suit. As a result of f
n- the advertising he sold six suits h
?y a day which made a profit of $12 f,
al a day, or $72 a week, or $18 more tl
n per week than he had made not c;
ts advertising. At the end of the
month, after paying his advertis- y
it ing bill, his profit was $57 more re
Le than the month that he did not p
n advertise. M
h- Now who paid for the adver- c(
o tising? Each customer saved $1; si
e the merchant made $57, and the m
y printer $15. Now, the question ti
o is, did anybody lose anything? nm
This merchant saved the people gi
- of his community $144 in a month si
and made mroney by it. Now, si'
o away goes your foolish notion of
I saving money by trading with
t the merchant who does not ad- th
vertise.
e Advertising is not a luxury, it fo
t is a necessity. The customer se
t does not pay for it; increased es
i sales pay for it. The merchants ti
I who do not advertise are the ones ,
I who howl most about the mail a I
order houses and hard times; ab
and they are also the very mer- inj
chants who have their envelopes a
printed in Washington, D. C., tif
thereby patronizing the biggest ch,
mail order concern in the world. ra'

Snowfall in Shreveport. LO
Shreveport, Dec. 29.-Shreve- da;
port came mighty near having a tor
white Christmas. But it did not. the
Last night, however, there was poi
just oodles of the "beautiful" tio
flying over this town. It com- Cot
menced to snow a little after 8 T
o'clock and for an hour the big and
flakes frolicked about and made poi0
the air white. There was a tang 'c
to it that painted the cheeks of ele
those who were out and while c
but few ventured into the night, wyr
those who did gathered up Col
enough snow to toss a few snow- Per
balls and imagine they were hav- Job
ing a lot of fun. Br
By 10 o'clock the snow had yen
ceased to fall and by midnight it
had disappeared except on some
grass plots where it had been not
banked by the wind. Had

Congress to Grant Twenty Battleships.
lion Washington, Dec. 29.-Whil
e in the Navy General Board has rec
ess ommended the construction of 42
ays battleships during the last twelve
the years and secretaries of the na
us- vy have reduced them to 29, con
ays gress has only authorized 20.
Ils. These figures are disclosed in the
in- summary of the recommenda
ich tions made by the board and by
it a the secretaries, published as an
appendix to Secretary Daniels
a annual report.
wn In 1903 the general board laid
'er down the policy that the fleet
ras should consist of 48 battleships
ng of the first line by 1919 a policy
an to which it has faithfully adher
ies ed up to this year, when it aban.
nd doned specifiic figures and de
63. clared the fleet should be the
or strongest afloat by rot later than
le- 1925. The board urged two
h, ships in 1903 and one was au
ist thorized. The next year it urg
ch ed three ships to make up the
ar deficiency and two were author
ly ized. In 1907 it recommended
of four ships, a figure to which it
ts has clung until this year, when
12 four dreadnoughts and four bat
re tle cruisers, or a total of eight
ot capital ships were asked for.
le With the exception of three
s- years during this period the sec
re retaries have reduced the board's
At proposal by one or two ships.
With the exception of five years,
r- congress eliminated at least one

Sugar Season Short.
h Lockport, La., Dec. 29.-With
the closing down of the Lock
port Central and the Lower La
it fourche sugar factories, the sugar
season of 1915, one of the short
d est for many years in this sec
s tion, was brought to a close last
s week. The Lower Lafourche ran
la little over a month and handled
about 30,000 tons of cane, mak
ing a part of it into syrup, and
sa part into sugar, some of a beau
tiful white granulated variety,
t choice for family use, and some era
raws for the large refineries. clei
The grinding season at the see
Lockport Central lasted for sixty >
- days, and it handled about 40,000 Sm
tons of sugar cane, making in M.
the neighborhood of 5,000,000 Ch(
pounds of sugar, raw and planta- L
tion granulated. T.

I asked the New Year for some motto sweet,
Some rule of life by which to guide my feet;
I asked and paused-It answered soft and low-.
"God's will to know."
"Will knowledge then suffice New Year?" I cried;
But ere the question into silence died
The answer came-"Nay, this remember, too-..
"God's will to do."
Once more I asked-"Is there still more to tea '
And once again the answer sweetly fell
Yea, this one thing, all other t gs above.
"God's will to love." "
