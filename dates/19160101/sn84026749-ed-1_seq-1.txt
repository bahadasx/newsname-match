SUBMARINE VICTIM
Brief Dispatches Tell of Disaster to P. &. 0.
Vessel Off Coast of Egypt American
Official a Passenger on Way to Post at
Aden.
LONDON, Jan. 1, The. Peninsular and Oriental
liner Persia, flying the British flag, was sunk in the Medi
terranean by a submarine on Thursday.
The Persia was sent to .the bottom southeast of the
island of Crete, not far from the Egyptian coast, according
to the dispatches.
All the reports indicate that nearly all perished.
Only four boatloads of passengers and members' of the
crew cleared the sinking liner.
Among the passengers

was also announced today.
The Persia was en route from London to Bombay.
She was one of the great fleet of liners owned by the Pen
insular and Oriental Company, of London, engaged prin
cipally in trade between English ports and the Far East.
The first message received in London contained no de
tails of the sinking of the liner, leaving it in doubt as to
whether she had attempted to escape or had been torpedoed
without warning.
At the London offices of the Peninsular and Oriental
Company it was stated that all the information available
was contained in a brief dispatch stating that she had been
sunk and that probably there had been a large loss of life.
"The Persia carried many passengers and a large
crew," said an officer of the line. "We have no definite
figures just now as to the exact number."
Not more than 200 persons could get away in four of
the Persia's boats, officers said, in commenting on the state
ment that only four of her boats managed to clear. In all
likelihood, they said, the number of survivors was consid
erably less than 200.
"The Persia was well equipped with lifeboats," said
one officer. "The very, fact that only four of her boats
managed to clear indicates she sank rapidly and apparently
confirms reports of a large loss of life. We are hopeful,
however, that early reports are exaggerated."
The Persia displaced 7,974 tons, being only slightly
smaller than the Italian liner Ancona, which was sunk by a
uuuianuc. one was duiii in iyuu at ureenock, Scotland,
and was registered from that port. She was 499 feet long
and had a 58-foot beam. Her- commander, as given by
1 .loyd's, was H. S. Bradshaw.
Excepting the Lusitania and the Arabic, the Persia is
the largest British liner to be sent to the bottom by a tor
pedo. She is the first large British passenger-carrier sunk
in the Mediterranean.
