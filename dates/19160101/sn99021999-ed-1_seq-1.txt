Omaha has just closed the moat
successful year's business it hag en
joyed since the city was planted on
the banks of the IssMourl river
nearly three-quarters of a century
ago.
The greatest gains are In real es
tate transfers, manufacturing job
bing, building operations and bank
clearings.
Figures on the manufacturing and
jobbing have again been complied by
the bureau of publicity in the same'
painstaking way in which the bureau
has done this for the last several
years, getting exact figures to the
last penny from each individual
manufacturer and Jobber in the city
to make up an absolutely reliable
total.
Hi Ral Estate Deal.
The volume ot real estate transfers al
most doubled over the amount of auch
business done last year. Thua the figures
stand In round numbers approximately
13.600,000 last, to nearly $16,000,000 this
year. One thing, of course, is to be con
sidered In these figures, namely that
they are more nearly representative of
the actual volume of money represented
,ln the transfers of the year than the
'figures have been in past years. This Is
because the necessity of buying federal
revenue stamps for the Instrumentalities
of real estate transfers, makes it ob
ligatory upon the parties to the contract
to reveal the true amount represented In
the transaction, instead of filing a deed
bearing the easy phrase "considera
tion SI." j
By no means, however, does this new
system account for the whole of the in
crease recorded, for the year ha been
especially productive of big deals in real
estate. So much' has this been true that
the activity has on several occasions:
boom.
Manufacturing; Gain.

OMAHA FACTORIES
BOOST FOR OMAHA
Campaign to Push Sale of Omaha
Goods in Omaha Trade Territory
is Attended with Satisfac
tory Results.
GREAT BENEFIT TO NEBRASKA
Last March, some sixty or more
of th leading manufacturing firms
and corporations of Omaha entered
upon a campaign that had , for - its
purpose the education of the people
of Nebraska and Omaha trade terri
tory In regard to patronising home
Industry and the usp" ' of Omaha
made goods, price gad quality being
equal to those .manufactured else
where. These Ornaha manufacturers, and
those Intimately connected with
them, in the campaign, did not work
aloi;e, nor did they hide their light
under a bushel. Instead, they
called the newspapers to their as-
iistance and through the medium of
the press, once each week during
the balance of the year, they ex
ploited their plans.
With the end of the year those who
went into) the campaign cast up their ac
counta, made their eetlmates and decided
that the experiment waa attended with
the best kind of resulta and that by
reason of the work carried on, the name
of Omaha and the excellent reputation
of its manufacturing Industries had been
carried Into new fields and that trade
waa being driwn from a much larger
area.
Money Well Invested.
The plan adopted by the Omaha manu
facturers coat them some money, but
they feel that it was money well invested.
For the information to the public that,
went out weekly through the press was a
constant booster, one that waa working
twenty-four hours every day and aeven
daya each week.
Of the sixty or more manufacturing
concerns that entered into the scheme
there was not one that did not secure
from five to fifteen new customers by
reason of the campaign that waa carried
on. Merchants all through Iowa, Minne
sota, Kansaa, South Dakota, Nebraska
and the mountain states became familiar
with the ilnea put out by the Omaha
manufacturing concerns and It was not
long after the inception of the plan be-

ping directions.
The advertisements that were Inserted
in the Omaha papers each Tuesday soon
same to be lookel upon as familiar ac
quaintances and within a couple of
months they were classed among the old
friends.
The merchants in Omaha trade terri
tory soon became convinced that with
their closeneaa to the place of produc
tion, they could order their goods and
get them much sooner than dealing with
manufacturers in far away cities. They
too, reoognlied that by buying Omaha

every instance.
Beoatlaa; the Central West.
There was still another thing that mer
chants of Omaha trade territory took into
consideration when they ordered Omaha
made gooda. In the paat when they had
been buying goods manufactured in dis
tant cities they realised that they were
building tip industries that were foreign
to them and their interests. When it
came to buying goods, the output of
the factories of Omaha, they quickly
realized that they were helping to build
up a bigger and a better Omaha and
that meant building up the atat of
Nebraska and the adjacent territory.
They realised that by having a greaei
Omaha, it meant a better market for
everything they and their neighbora had
to eell. It meant a better market for

COPENHAGEN (Via London),
Ded. 31. The Ford peace delegates
arrived here today. Crowds of per

The states which are to enter the
c'ry column are Iowa, Colorado, Ore
gon, Washington, Arkansas and
South Carolina. Many counties in all
of the seven states have prohibited
the sale of liquor for a number of
years under local option laws.
In Colorado district attorneys at a re
cent meeting agreed that technically Colo
rado's constitutional prohibition amend
ment and the enforcing statute do not be
come effective until midnight January 1
but It waa alao decided that the expira
tion of all liquor licenses at midnight to

Arkansas will hare Its first experience
with prohibition when the statewide law,
passed by the last legislature, goes Into
effect with the coming of the new year.
The Arkansas department of the Anti
Saloon league has announced that the
league will have workers in the field to

Hresyon Law Drastic.
I In Oregon the manufacture or sale of
i any kind of Intoxicating liquor is abso-
lutely prohibited by constitutional amend-
I ment. Drug stores are not permitted to
sell liquor for any purpose, with or with
i out a doctor's prescription. Each family
j may Import for personal use a maximum
either of two quarts of spirituous or vln-
ous liquors, or twenty-four quarts of malt
liquors in any period of four successive

medical, scientific and mechanical uses,
which is procurable only on an order
from the probate court.

BRITISH CRUISER
NATALGOES DOWN
Big Fighting Ship Sinks in Harbor
as Result of an Internal
Explosion.
FOUR HUNDRED MEN SAVED
LONDON. Dec. 31. The Urltlsh
armored cruiser Natal has sunk after
an explosion. Official announcement
to this effect was made here today.
The Natal was sunk yentorday af
ternoon while In harbor, as the re
sult of an Internal explosion. There
are about 400 survivors.
The Natal's sinking Is the most severe
loss which the British navy has sustained
In several months. No British naval
veasela of Importance have been sunk
since laat May, when the Triumph and
Majestlo were torpedoed at the Darda
nelles. The keel ot the Natal was laid
down eleven years ago and Its displace
ment waa only about one-half of the
largest British sea fighters.
The vessel's normal complement was
704 men. Its displacement waa 1J.W0 tona.
It was if) feet long and ?S feet beam. Its
largest guns were S.S Inches. Of these
It carried three forward and three aft.
It was armed also with four 7.5-Inch
guns, twenty-four three-pounders and
three torpedo tubes.
The Natal brought from Portsmouth

California Solons
Called to Revise
New Primary Act
CAN FRANCISCO. Cat.. Dec. Sl.-Oov
ernor Hiram W. Johnson Issued a state
ment today announcing that he would
call a sDcctnt session uf the California
legislature to meet Wednesday, January
ti. lSltt. to cotislder the acquisition of the
California building at the ranama-ra-clflc
exposition for a state normal school
and to unravel a primary law tangle.
T-e call will be iaaued within twenty
four hours.
The primary laws ot the state are gen
erally considered In an unsatisfactory
condition because some measures In
tended to provide for non-partisan regis
tration and elections were rejected at a
recent election, while one of the aerlos
of lawa to thla effect was left standing.
In his statement the governor terms
the election law situation "Inextricable
confusion." A third object of the special
session, the second to be called during
the five years of Governor Johnson's ad
ministration, is an act for the benefit
of the Panama-California International
exposition at San Diego, Cal.. which will
be open all through the year.
Four days are set as the probable dura-
tlon of the session and I1S,000 as the cost,
although the statement says filibustering
tactics may run this up.
Rumors Five Are to

LONDON, Dec. 31.-AII members of ths

pulsory military service, and It appears.
consequently, there have been no resigns- I

The foreign secretary. Sir Edward
Grey, and the war secretary, Karl Kitch
ener, are also mentioned In connection
with possible changes ln the cabinet, but
even if several members withdraw it la
now clear that the government will not
break up over the question.
Sir Edward Grey's health Is again put
forward as a reason he may retire ln
case of any reorganisation of the minis
try. The general Impression Is that opposi
tion to the plan for compulsory service
en the part of labor Is lessening, although
the decision of labor leaders to refer the
matter to the trades union congress
leaves this question still open.

TRANSLATORS WORK ON NOTE
WASHINGTON, Dec. 31. Ameri
can demands on Austria-Hungary a
connection with the destruction of the
steamer Ancona apparently hare been
met In the new note from Vienna. The
official text of Austria's Anoona note
was received early today at the 8tate
department. The work of transla
ting from diplomatic rode will take
several hours and arrangements for
publication will be made later.
If the official text of Austria's reply
to the second American note coo forms
to press dispatches, saying the com
munication announced that the submarine
commander who torpedoed the steamer
had been punished, virtually only one
phase of the Incident remains to be
cleared up.
Indemnity Isaae f Be Hat.
That would be the payment of Indem
nity for American lives lost, for which
Austria has expressed a willingness ta
make reparations. Later, however, there
may be full exchanges between the United
States and Austria on the question of
submarine warfare and the necessity for
warning before attacking merchantmen.
It waa pointed out her that la punish
ing the submarine commander for failure
to take Into accouut the pan! a prevailing
aboard the Anoona before torpedoing the
vessel, the Austrian government In ef
fect, disavowed the aot and gave assur
ances that there would be no repetition
ot auch sn Incident.
Officials Reserve Comment,
Although officials reserved comment
today pending the receipt of the official
text, there was a relaxation of tha ten
sion which has been evident here. Up un
til a few days sgo there waa an air of
gravity in oflclal ciroles here over the
situation and the relations between the
two countries appeared to be on the
verge of a break, but within the last day
or two there had been Intimations of a
favorable settlement of the controversy.
The Ancona was sunk by an Austrian
submarine off the Tunisian coast on No
vember 7. A few days later the Ameri
can government dispatched a note to the
Austro-Ilungarian government demanding
a disavowal of tha attack, punishment of
the submarine commander, reparation for
loss of American lives and assurances
that such acta would not occur again.
Austria's reply was regarded as unsatis
! factory and unacceptable to the Amerl-
can government, and a second not was
I sent asking for a compliance with the
original American demands. The new
Austrian note is In answer to that com
