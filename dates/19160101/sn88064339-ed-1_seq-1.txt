MR PARKER'S POLITICSt
(New Orleans Stales.
Nor is it true that he has been a
Democrat nationally and locally up to
his alliance with the Progressive party
three years ago.
In 1894 Mr. Parker was bitterly op`
posed to Gov. Foater and we have
heard it said without vouching for it
be was among the several thousand
Citiens' Leaguers who voted for John
N. Pharr, the Republcan candidate.
In the city campaign of 18" he could
not make up his mind whether to
support the Regular Democrats or
Jacksonians and wound up by propos
lag a ticket partly ring and partly
reform.
In 1804. In one of the most exciting
municipal elections we ever had, he
was a squawnma. He shouted on the
street corners for the "ring" and could
not vote for Roosevelt. Republican, his
choice for President. because he had
not paid his poll taxes.
In 1908 he voted an open Republican
ticket for William H. Taft.
In 1912 he quit the Louisiana lDe
mocracy. denounced both State and
National Democracy, joined the Pro
gressive party and cast his vote for
Roosevelt.
Mr. Parker is, therefore, not a Dem.
ocrat at all, regular or independent.
"I am a Progressive," he wrote on
September, "and running on a Progsr
slve platf.rm."
There ts no longer a Progresolve
party in the nation. A Progresstive
and a Republican now are one and the
same thing.
No man can honestly vote for John
M Parker unless he goes out of the
Democratic party to do so.

paign, Monday, Jan. 24
The Barret headquarters sent out
over the state this week a piece of
literature which absolutely convicts
Col. Pleasant of double-dealing In re,
gard to the prohibition question. It
conslsts of a rta simile of a eard issued
last July, when the constitutional con
vention Aght was in progress, bearing
the photograph of Col. Pleasant in the
center, with the legend: "Local Belf
Government the Foundation of True
Democracy." It also contained the
phrases: "Baton Rouge for Baton
Rouge," "Shreveport for Shreveport,"
etc., being a plain argument In favor
of segregation of citles from the par.
ishes on the liquor question, and per
mitting the large cities of the state to
return to the open saloon In spite of
country majorities. Col, Pleasant has
never publicly denaled authorship of
these cards, so tar as known,. mo has
he denounced the men who elrculated
then La wet territory ito his behalf.
When it Ls remembered that Col. Pleas
ant poses as a lifelong prohibitionist,
tbhis eaard is a por.,

THOMAS APPROVES
(Lake Charle Amerw e-Pres.)
Only one roie has been raised so
far In the state In favor of the dl
bhoest dtitribution of state school
funds, whereby eight parishes of the
state receive for school plrposes more
money than they pay in for all petr
pose. ftortyeve receivtre more school
money than they pay Into the state,
and nine parishes, including Caleunse,
reesve for chbools $314,12.10 and pay
into the state treasury $1MI83L13.1 .
That volce beloap to Lee asmet
Thomas of Shreveport.
Mr. Thomas evidently does not know
by what system this dishonest disten
button of school funds is effected, but
he is "ter" it, anyway, for he slid
recently In as Interview In the Baton
Rouge Chronicle:
"This talk of grantUin school appro
priations according to the educable
children in each parish Is all wronag
brome parishes may have little weath
and a great many chbildren. I am a
heavy tax payer and have no children
to seed to school, but do not object to
my school taxes for keeping up schools
where children are to be educated. If
some of these parishes received large
appropriations It was because they
were entitled to them."
Just what the Hon. Lee Emmet is
talking about nobody knows but him
self. As ai matter of taot, the school
funds are now distributed according to
the educable children in each parish-
r that Is, the total number of school age
S-and it is under this plan that the
present robbery is carried out
The injustice of the system lies it
distributing the money aonording to
the number of children entitled to as
education, whereas it should be appor
tloned proportionately to the number
receiving an education. Parlshes In
I the state are drawinl more mouey for
educational purposes than Caleaseu.
r in which the great majority of the o4de
cable children are negroes. The jponey
" thus obtained by them is not being
used to educate negroes, but is applied
to the white schools for the purpose of
Srelleving the parish taxpayers of local
Itaxation for schools.
Is It right and Just that Caleslsa,
which spends $100,000 or more of its
own money on its schools, should be
taxed for a contribution of $20,000 by
the state so that the people of the
negro parishes may make the state
t pay all the school epenses of those
parishes?
Nobody would say so exoept Lee
I Emmet Thomas. Statesman Thomas
evidently thinks that his stand will
gain him friends in the fiftyi.ve dellta
quent parishes. We think he is misl
taken. We do not believe that one of
them would willingly become a parasite
upon its sister partshes. Statesman
r Thomas will likely find himself very
lonesome in his endorsement of the
` robbery of the people of one perish for
the benefit of the tax dodgers In a r
other parish.
