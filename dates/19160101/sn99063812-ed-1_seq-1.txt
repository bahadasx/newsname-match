Mayor's Message;Deak
With Affairs of Klamath
following are the moat Important
IMirtloas of Mayor J. B. Maaoa's mete -
ixe to the city ceuncil:
nil, fltsT'fltmrlmr malraa II tk Antv
otvfnAayor to-C(mmttMlcate-t6'you,
st tbl lime by message, a general
statement of the condition and affairs
of the city. To that end I address you.
Wo have groat reason to be thank
ful to the Clvor of Every Oood and
Perfect Gift for a reasonable degree of
health In our city during the past year
aad for protectloa from the destruc
tion to llfo and property by the ele
ments which ha visited many other
communities.
Financee. '"
In general, the state of the city treas
ury is very sstlsfsetory; there remain
ing this day a balance of f40.et3.lt la
the hands of the treasurer, distributed
In the several funds as shown In the
treasurer' statement attached thereto.
Street.
The problem of tho building and up
keep of street la one which la ever
present. There seems to be scarcely
any limit to the calla for expenditure
of money on them. The careful, Judl
clous and economical administration ot
this department demands a capacity
for thought and a wllllngnoaa for ac
tion ot which those who have given
these things no special attention have
but little conception. The recent rainy
weather ha made the keeping of Mala
street In good condition almost Impos
alble with our present equipment. This
matter will be greatly improved when
Pine street and intersections are
payed.. To keep our streets la the
best condition in muddy weather we
should own aad operate a fluaher.
A large amount of good work has
been done tbla fall and winter, espe-
daily in the building of wooden side
walks and cross walks. Wa are hoping
for the time when new sidewalks caa
be made from cement or other perma
nent material. Permancy should be
the aim, and all street Improvements
should be made with thla end In view.
Improved streets must be kept la re
pair in order that the heavy invest
ments already made In street paving
may aot be lost
In the present tax levyprovialon was
made for re-olling the payed portion of
Third, Sixth aad Ninth streets. Thla
matter should receive attention aa
soon as the weather permits. la the
matter of aew street improvements the
cost is borae by the abutUag property
owaers, aad where tae owaers ravor
such Improvement wo believe these im
provements should be made with aa
little delajr.Hiwaalhlo,
We desire to eall attention to the
Ihipaiagtoa aad Peuesa city

Wats aewftlfwte.'
Wo desire to call
attention to the
fact that the city is being served by the
California-Oregon Power company un
der a contract which expired several
year ago. This Is a source of much
annoyance and misunderstanding to
both the company aad the people. The
question ot a hotter system ot atreet
lighting and the equity of the rates for;
water, light, power aad heat are aub
JcctM that should be taken up at aa
early a date aa possible and be Bat
tled upon some basis which Is fair to
both the company and the consumer,
Instead of permitting It to drift along
In this uncertain and unbusinesslike
manner.
Fire Department
The chartor very plainly contem
plate n city fire department Up to
the presont we have had aa Independ
ont volunteer Are company, tho mem
bers of which have done much
service for the city. They hare
out In response to the Ire alarm, win
ter and summer, day and night, aad
have alwaya dono valiant service, with
no small risk to life and limb; with no
hope ot reward, thereby earning the
gratitude of the entire community, In
view of the growth and development
of the city It would seem that the time
has come when a reorganisation of
this department of service is Impera
tive. Large InvesUnenta, employing
many workmen, need Increased facili
ties for Are protection. To tbla end
more efficient Are fighting apparatus
so located aa to give the best service
to all district of the city ahould he
secured with as, little delay as possi
ble. I recommend the matter for your
early attentloa.
Police Department
I suppose there la In the state no
city of like site containing saloons,
whleh employs as small a aumber of
policemen as Klamath Falls. Wa have
a chief of police and two patrolmen.
The fact that good order Is maintained
with this small force speaks well for
the cltltonshlp of the community and
for the efficiency of the members of
the force.
Law Enforcement.
On January 1st the prohibitory
amendment becomes a law of the state,
and should bo uphold aad obeyed. No
maa has a right. to refuse to obey aay
law, however trivial or aaealled for, or
even unjust, he atay believe it to. be.
No officer who M charged with the ea
forcement of 'law has a right to decide
as to whether or aot he will eaforeo
aay parUealar taw. Laws arc to bo
obeyed. The kibMaH, pbrstoteat aoa
InforocBteat of aay law begets disre
gard for all law, Such a state of af-
fairs bring contempt for law, and the
result I anarchy. I desire to bespeak
your corporation u well as that of tho
entire rltlienshlp In tho enforcement
of all laws, and especially that of the
prohibitory law during the early
months of Its operation.
Cenelualen.
In conclusion I desire to thank the
members of this body for their uniform
support aad co-operation In the many
difficult situation we have passed
through, and trust we may ever be
found worthy of the confidence Im
posed upon us.
