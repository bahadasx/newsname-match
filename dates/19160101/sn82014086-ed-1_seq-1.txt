Danger of Rupture Has Passed. '
It may be stated . authoritatively,'
nevertheless, that danger of a rupture
of diplomatic relations has passed, and
the controversy now enters the same
stage as the Lusitanla negotiations
with Germany, on even a more favor
able basis. i -
. . A Far -Reaching Assurance.
Austria -' In - the ' Ancona case has
subscribed to the principle that no
ships will be sunk unless they offer
resistance or flee, without the persons
aboard being brought to safety. This
is considered . an' assurance that is
far reaching and satisfactory.
Germany promised only not to "at
tack liners" until the persons aboard
had been placed in boats. The desig
nation "liners" has never been' cleared
up and the American government does
not concede that placing persons In
boats necessarily assures their safety.
Points for Further Correspondence.
" Points which Austria leaves for fur
thur diplomatic correspondence are not
considered of a nature to bring on a
new crisis. Chief among them are
questions of fact which affect Aus

Preparing to Investigate.
' ' Both the department of justice and
the federal trade commission are pre
paring to investigate gasoline prices.
A statement issued by the geological
survey estimated the 1915 production
of market petroleum at 267,400,000
barrela, 2,000 barrels - more than - in
1914. ,. , - -
"This." says .the statement, does not

"As- a result of thej overload put on

be characterized as a -period of read

Will Soon -Reach $2.50 a Barrel.
A low petroleum price level was
reached In April and until August,
the price remained at 1 1.35 a barrel
for the market standard. Then the
price began to soar and on December
17 petroleum was selling at W.15. In
dications now are, say3 the statement,
that the price will soon reach $2.50
its eprevious high record. '
Big Reserve Stock.
One production fact brought out by
the survey is that the crude petroleum
stocks held in reserve, the largest ever
known, increased 50,000,000 barrels in
1915 and at present more than 220,000,
000 barrels are being held. Field stor
age by producers, accounts for 24,
000,000 barrels of this. .
Export Figuree. (-
Export figures for the first ten .
month of 1915 show that gasoline ex
ports dropped far below the same pe
riod in 1914, and slightly below 1913.
During the ten months ending with
October 98,471,466 barrels left the
United States, a gain of 40,275,273 for
the same period in 1914, and 100.&&3,
871 in 1913.
