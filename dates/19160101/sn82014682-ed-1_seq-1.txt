That "the city -should float' a bond
Issue to cover the ; installation of pipea
for adequate water supply , in .settled
districts that are now. short of -water,
is the belief of Harry E, Murray, gen
eral manager of the departments ,
When new tracts are opened, up
Murrayr"favors the plan of compelling
the promoters to install these pipes
for the residents who may purchase
lots don; the tracts."'1 -;-.;y v- .-:t y-:-
The question of who shall pay the
cost of water extension is rather
vexed one in the states, the idea of
having it paid on the frontage tax
basis being popular in many places. .
"Adequate supply, says Murray
"should be water enough for domestic
purposes and for protection .against

by buying up lots with water, supply
on them, only to find; later that Ihe

five houses would go up, each tapping
this one main , whjch : consisted of, a
three-quarter inch pipe, .. with the : re
sult that in a short time no one could
get any water. ,''''"' ''
""It is not fair"saysMurray, 'o
ask these people who haye hought the
property in good faith to pay for the
Installation of new mains. Some of
them have done so, hut not all are
able to bear the expense. :
"We have put In quite a number of
mains this year out of the funds of
the department,, replacing small mains
with, larger ones. Our total for this
work is about $14,000 during the year,

Fight On In Spokane.
4 Spokane, Washington, one of the
leading cities of the Northwest is hav
ing much discussion over the question
of water main extension. Prior to 1911
the city ran on the policy of penaliz
ing the users of water on a street for
the benefit of the owners of vacant
lots thereon.' j - . " y
: To 'this sjnstem of having, one man
pay . for a line, which. passes several
vacant lots that may later derive bene
fit from' the pipe, .the commissioners
at that time were so " opposed , that
they discarded it . Some of the pres
ent commissioners of ; that city, it
seems, are trying: to establish the plan
again.. .. ,. yy. . --.-y
v; Mayor Fassett who Is vigorously op
posing the plan .to revert to the old
method, is quoted in the Spokesman
Review of November 27 as saying:'
"The "policy which has been in use
since 1911 places the burden of water
main extensions where ' it belongs,
namely upon the property immediate
ly benefited. .The vacant lot pays its
share, which it' never did before, yy
? The adoption of this policy has
enabled, the; city , to effect a substan
tial reduction in water rates to 95 per
cent of our residents who have Install
ed meters, and this without serious
reduction in revenues. . : y y y .
