The Grand Army of the Republic
has been one of the strong agence-s
behind the big pension bills. The
influence that this body of men with
allied organizations has been able
to bring to bear on lawmakers has
been tremendous. Within recent
years the death rate in the Grand
Army has been hig'h. It is becoming
less of a political factor. Northern
congressmen are realizing, this,' et
and they are becoming mUch more
critical of pension applications.
They fear that- tad tigrait milkiam

Morgan believes the time is ripe to

Louisiana Tranng Institute
The Louisiana Training Institute
is a State institution and is the
Sbhome of neglected Juveniles of the
Mtate. ,It is situated about two miles
outside the town of IMonroe. On
the -gronds proper -are two large
brick buildings and one cottage.
urrounding these: the State owns
two hundred and seventy acres of
lead, nearly all of which is culti
vated by the inmates of the said in
stitution. The Louisiana Training
Institute is under the direct super
vision of Supt. Moore and his wife,
and lastbut- not least, ia little blue
eyed Miss about five years old, who
is the idol and little sister of the
forty-three mishevieus young ras
cas.t BeSides the Superintendent,
there are three teachers, two of
,whik teach the academic.course, and
one, :a :lgaduate of the Mississippi
A. & M. College, teaches the agri
cultural course. Three days out of
the week the" boys are taught the
Trtee R's, and the-other three days
they work on fhe farm or in the
jdairy.. Sunday is a day of rest and
church., ,The boys don their uni

believes firmly in the old adage that
"all work and no play makes Jack
a dull boy." The boys are well
treated, have good, healthy food, and
a large airy dormitory with individ
ual- white beds.
(Having visited 'both the penal
farms attached to the penitentiary
and the Louisiana Training Institute
I would that every mother and fetlh
er of the State of Louisiana could
and would read the following, com
parison, and note the injustice that
is being legally dohe to the youths
of the State: There are boys undo
the age of seventeen in both institu.
tions. On the penal farms they are
clothed in stripes; they work under
the barrel of a shot-gun. Their pic
tures adorn the regues -gallery, and
they associate with criminals. Thekr
education is one gleaned from crl.i
inals steeped in every crime. Their
lectures are the tales of crimes com
mitted by older men. They play
cards and shoot craps. When their
sentence expires they graduate pro
ficient criminals Instead of repentant
law-breakers. They are hounded to
death by the police, who know theft
nunmber, and take to crime again out
of self preservation. At the Louisi
ana Training Institute all environ-
ment of a prison is removed and
that of -a home takes its place. They
are educated under the influence of
a good woman and mother. They
receive a public school education and
are taught to till the soil. They as
soctate only with boys of their own
age. They have their hours of play
and receive, the teachings of the
church of their, choice... In time they
earn their parole and having tIlo
no time in school they are none then
worse for an act of outhtful india

The program for Parkview Theatre
on New Year's Day (today) will be
a powerful drama with the leading
roles portrayed by Francis X. Bush
man and Marguerite Snow. A mati
nee will be run at 5 p. m. and the
price of admission- will be 10 cents
for children and 20 cents for adults.
This is one of the moat interesting
dramas that the management has
booked in some time. Owing to the
pmpularity of this feature it was a
streak of .ack that the managers
were able to book it for this day.
