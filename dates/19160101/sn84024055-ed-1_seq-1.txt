No. 15
t-- irFSi.
Two Fly Cops from the Headquarters of Charles C. Healey,
Chief of Police in the City Hall, Invaded the Parlors of the
Appomattox Club, Last Thursday Evening, and Arrested
Eight or Ten of Its Members for Playing Cards for Money
Open and Above Board
THE OFFICEES OP THE LAW CARRIED AWAY SOME OF THE POKER
CHIPS AND SOME OF THE MONEY TO USE AS EVIDENCE AGAINST
THE PLAYERS WHEN THEIR CASES COME TJP IN THE CLARK
STREET POLICE COURT FOR TRIAL EITHER THE 11TH OR 12TH OF
JANUARY.
COL. WILLIAM RANDOLPH COWAN
IN THE RAID TO THE STANTON
HEAD BONDSMAN FOR THEM.
OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR THE WIVES AND OTHER MEMBERS OF
THE FAMILIES OF THE GENTLEMEN WHO WERE CAUGHT IN THE
POLICE NET RED HANDED AND WITH THE GOODS ON THEM THEIR
NAMES WILL BE WITHHELD FROM PUBLICATION IN THESE
COLUMNS.
IT MAY NOT BE TRUE BUT IT IS SAID THAT "CHIEF HEALEY HAS
STRONGLY INTIMATED THAT THE FLY COPS HAD MADE A MIS
TAKE IN RUSHING INTO THE CLUB AND THAT IT WOULD NOT
OCCUR AGAIN AND ON FRIDAY EVENING IT IS CONTENDED THAT
CARD PLAYING WAS RUNNING AT FULL BLAST AGAIN.
OUT OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE MEMBERS OF THE
APPOMATTOX CLUB NOT OVER TWENTY-FIVE OR THIRTY OF
THAT NUMBER FEEL THAT THEY MUST AT ALL TIMES SHUFFLE
THE CARDS FOR MONEY AND IT IS GREATLY TO BE DEPLORED
THAT THEY WILL PERSIST IN BRINGING EVERLASTING DISGRACE
ANDSHAME UPON. THEMSELVES AND THECLUB WHICH'SHOULD
STAND AS A BEACON LIGHT FOR EVERYTHING THAT IS ELEVAT
ING AND ENNOBLING AMONG THE COLORED PEOPLE IN THIS
CITY.
If any one of our dear departed
friends who have joined the great
heavenly host would be able to come
forth from their graves it would be
very hard for them to convince us that
the time would ever come to pass that
officers of the law would become so
bold that they would have the nerve
to invade the Appomattox Club and
:irrest some eight or ten of its most
prominent members for playing cards
for money; open and above board that
was just what came to pass last Thurs
day evening, for at about ten o'clock
on that evening two fly cops from the
headquarters of Chief of Police Charles
( Healey in the City Hall rushed into
the parlors of the club and pulled out
some of the head or the most ex
port stud poker players, the officers
of the law carrying away with them
miiiic of the poker chips and some of
tho money which they grabbed up from
the tables and the money and the poker
hips will be used as evidence against
tho players when their cases come up
in" the Clark street police court for trial
either the 11th or 12th of January,
101 G.
The news in connection with the
raid of the club has traveled by way
of tho "grapevine route" to all parts
of this city and throughout the United
states for the railroad men have car
ried the news in every direction; Col.
William Randolph Cowan, so it is main
tained, accompanied those caught in
the police raid to the Stanton ave. sta
lion and was the head spokesman or
tho chief bondsman for them.
It was very lucky for some of the
head stud poker players that the of
ior swamped down on the club on
Thursday evening instead of Saturday
veiling for if they would have waited
''til the latter evening they would
laie been able to have gathered into
their folds or nets some of the biggest
rator and members of the club, and
it would have been a splendid joke if
tliey viouhl have caught the real orHhe
head dog in the meat house when it
cini'os down to playing a stiff game of
:-'ul poker and that distinguished
gentleman holds some kind of a prom
inent position in tho City Hall and it
would have reflected great credit on
the Colored people in general residing
" Jhi city and on Mayor William
Hale Thompson if the police would
have arretted one of his most prom
pt Colored aids for gambling.
One or two of the newly elected of
ficers of the club were caught in the
ACCOMPANIED THOSE CAUGHT
AVENUE STATION AND WAS THE
raid and by all means a special meet
ing of the members of the club should
be held and men who do not gamble for
money open and above board should be
elected in their places.
Out of the highest consideration for
the wives and the other members of
the families of the first class gentle
men who were caught in the police net
red handed with the goods on them
their names will not appear in these
columns, but if the same first class
gentlemen get caught the second time
then it might be different.
It may not be true and we do not
want to believe for one minute that it
is true but it is said that Chief Healey
has strongly intimated that the fly
cops had made a mistake in rushing in
to the club and that it would not occur
aain that he knows that Colored men
dearly love to play cards for money;"
Chief Healey must have said something
along that line for it is contended that
last Friday evening which was only
one night after the raid that card play
ing was again running in full blast.
At the present time there are two hun
dred and fifty-three members of the
Appomattox Club and of that number
not more than twenty-five or thirty
members at the very highest feel that
they have the undisputed right at all
times to shuffle tho cards for money
and it is greatly to be deplored that
such a small number of its members
will persist in bringing -everlasting
shame and disgrace not only upon
themselves and those who do not play
cards as well as on the club itself
which should stand as a beacon light
for everything that is elevating and
ennobling among the Colored people
in this great city and throughoutjbe
country.
It seems strange indeed that so many
Colored men feel that it is utterly im
possible for them to conduct any kind
..i t ..n;nrr from nli nr
f faisiiiftsa without running gambling
in connection with it and nine times out
of ten gambling is the direct cause of
their failure'in tho world of business
for playing cards for money where the
plavers stay up all night unfits thenn
every way to cheerfully discharge their
duties for the day, and to think that
men who claim to be sensible will risk
their hard earned money on the turn
of a card and sometimes the cards are
marked in order to more ?
rob and cheat them out of their money
which should rightfully be expended
towards the support of their wives and
their lovely and beautiful little child
ren.
THE REPORT OF THE VICE COM
MISSION OF MARYLAND
STRONGLY INDICATES THAT
THE LEADING WHITE CITIZENS
OF BALTIMORE THE CITY OF
CHURCHES ARE DEVOID OF AT.T.
MORALS AND THAT VICE OF
EVERY DESCRIPTION HAS
REACHED THE HIGHEST WAT
ER MARK IN THAT CITY.
The report of the Vice Commission
appointed by Governor Goldsborough
three years ago to investigate vice
conditions in the city of Baltimore and
in the State of Maryland was made
public in the daily journals of the city
and state last Monday. The chairman
is George Walker, one of the most
prominent physicians in the city. The
other members are equally noted in
their professions. The facts laid bare
are startling and "bewildering and se
riously undermines the social fabric of
White society in Baltimore and parts
adjacent thereto- It charges tha,Ii;u
ers prominent in professional life, in
church and social circles are involved
in a city-wide sv'stcm of immorality,
which, if disclosed, would shake Balti
more from center to circumference,
would fill the courts with applications
for divorces, and would wreck the
peace of hitherto happy homes. The
report charges that there is going on
in Baltimore, the city of churches, a
traffic in girls and babies which is as
tounding, and that there are open vice
conditions in which the so-called best
people are a party. Even leading
White ministers of high-toned churches
are implicated in the disclosures.
The Star, in a survey of the report,
says:
"Some of the things exposed would
be unbelievable were they not vouched
for by a commission of men and women
whose integrity is beyond question.
Personal and studied vice is so ram
pant that it is shown that many lead
ing bankers, physicians, lawyers, real
estate men, store owners and. high paid
employes use the most studied plans
for the ruination of young girls or to
keep women in lives of immorality.
Hundreds of typical cases are given.
In tho main report key initials are
used, but as a result of the assemblage
of facts as to ages, locations, acts of
commission and surrounding condi
tions, many citizens, leaders in the
church, business and social circles, will
be literally shaking in their boots.
"This tremendous social sore is of
such great scope that members of the
commission consider publication of
the general conditions of the same im
portance to the community as would
bo tho vital necessity of the surgeon's
knife to the individual in an extreme
appendicitis case. The task is not
pleasant to the members of tho com
mission or to those who have promised
to aid them, but that the state and
public authorities should be informed
in full and that the public mind should
bo thus awakened to its dangers, that
correction may bo demanded in a voice
that cannot be misunderstood, is con
sidered as vital by the commission.
"Some of tho orgies of 'our best
people,' as described in the commission
report in minute detail, would put the
orgies of ancient emperors of licen
tiousness to shame. 'Some, of them
would make Nero look like a piker,'
declared a member of the commis
sion." The commission did not seem to have
had time to look into vice conditions
ranong Negroes. Black society in Bal
timore therefore had better tako warn
ing and reform itself, for God knows
it needs a similar shaking up. The
Commonwealth, Baltimore, Md., De
cember 25, 1915.
1916 IS BABY YEAR. THE FACTS
ABOUT AMERICAN BABIES, THE
NEEDS OF AMERICAN BABIES,
AND AMERICA'S RESPONSIBIL
ITY TO HER BABIES WILL THIS
YEAR BE KNOWN AS NEVER BE
FORE, BECAUSE THE FIRST
WEEK IN MARCH WILL BE
BABY WEEK THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY.
More than 400 communities repre
senting every State in the Union are
already laying their plans for Baby
Week, according to the Children's Bu
reau of the U. S. Department of Labor,
in order that during those seven days
the needs of the babies may be so pre
sented that all the parents in those
communities will learn a little better
how to care forthcir babies, and all
tho citizens will realize that they have
a special obligation to safeguard the
conditions surrounding babies. And it
is confidently believed by those who
are interested in this nation-wide Baby
Week that the remainder of the year
will be marked by a strengthening of
all community activities for saving
babies' lives and giving them a better
chance to grow to a healthy maturity.
The Baby Week idea originated in
Chicago not quite two years ago. Then
New York had a Baby Week, and
Pittsburg, and other cities. Such
practical benefit has in each case re
sulted that the General Federation of
Women's Clubs has undertaken to pro
moto this nation-wide observance.
State health officials and national or
ganizations interested in public health
and child welfare have taken up the
plan and in various ways are giving
it not only their sanction but their
active cooperation. The extension di
visions of the State universities have
promised special assistance in interest
ing and helping Baby Weeks in rural
communities.
Tho Federal Children's Bureau be
lieves that Baby Week will give more
parents a chance to learn the accepted
principles of infant care, and will
awaken every American to his respon
sibility for the deaths of the three hun
dred thousand babies who, according to
tho Census estimates, die every year
before they are twelve months old.
Therefore the Children's Bureau has
prepared a special bulletin of practical
suggestions for Baby Week campaigns,
adapted to the varying needs of com
munities of different types. Copies of
this bulletin may be had free of charge
from the Children's Bureau at Wash
ington, D. C.
