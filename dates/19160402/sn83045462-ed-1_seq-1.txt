LONDON. April 1.?The Germans
gradually are closing in on
Verdun, drawing their lines a
little closer northeast of the
fortress, where by massed attacks
from two directions they
have secured a footing in the
village of Vaux.
The Germans carried out a"
heavy bombardment: to tlfife east
of the Meuse. This was fol
lowed by a German attack between
Douaumont and Vaux,
which, according to the communication
of the French war
^ office, was completely checked.

French Statement.
The text of tonight's French official
statement reads:
In Belgium our artillery bombarded
the enemy cantonments at Langeraarck,
northeast of Ypres.
In the Argonne our batteries were
active against the German organizar?ns
north of La Harazee and La Fille
Mort and against the enemy camps in
the northern part of the Cheppy wood.
West of the Meuse the bombarde?it
has been intense against our positions
between Avocourt and Malanourt.
To the east of the Meuse a quite
intent bombardment was followed in
he course of the German attack on the
a vine between Fort Douaumont and
he village of Vaux. The attack was
ompletely stopped by our curtain of
Arc.
In the Woevre the artillery activity
lias been less marked. On the rest of
he front there is nothing to report."
The Belgian official communication
^?ds. "Artillery action on both sides
fo\e occurred in the Pervyse and Cos'akerke
districts and south of Dix^ude."
German Official Report.
The official German statement of toirftv
from general headquarters is as
follows:
"Near St. Elol an attack with hand
grenades by the British was repulsed.
There was fighting with mines between
La Bassee canal and Neuville.
"Northeast of Roye the Are of the
French artillery was very spirited.
German artillery effectively shelled positions
of the enemy on the Aisne
front.
"There were violent artillery duels in
the Argonne and in the sector of the
Meuse.
"German battle air craft shot down
four French aeroplanes. Of these one
fell within our lines near Laon and
another near Mogeville, In the Woevre.
Two fell behind the enemy's lines, one
near Ville-Aux-Bots and the other
south of Haucourt. The French aerodrome
at Rosnay. west of Rheims, was
attacked with many bombs."
French Greatly Outnumbered.
A single battalion of French infantry
heid the salient comprising the village
of Malancourt in the Verdun region
west of the Meuse against forces twentv
times their number in the attack of
Thursday night until, surrounded on
three sides, they were compelled to
choose between retirement and capture.
Three German brigades attacked Just
after dark. The column attacking in
front met wi.n such sustained Are that j
It was thrown back before reaching a I
house of the village. The assaults
were renewed repeatedly at intervals
of a few minutes, the German ranks
growing thinner with each rush.
At about 11 o'clock the Germans
brought up a fresh brigade and attacked
furiously on all sides, but were
again thrown back by rifle Are and
bayonets.
Another Charge Made.
At 1 o'clock another charge was made.
It was directed principally against the
flank, and the column operating on the
left, after being repulsed several times,
succeeded in making a breach in the
defensive line of the French. Being
reinforced with more fresh troops the
Germans were able to hold the ground.
The French battalion still held out
and fought from house to house until
dawn. Than ths ever-increasing GerI
man reinforcements overwhelmed what
remained of the defending force. By
that time nothing was left of the village
but a pile of smoking ruins.
The Germans remained quiet along
that part of the line during the day, but
made heavy attacks against the advanced
French positions in the region
of Dead Man's hill. After preparation
with a veritable storm of shells. German
infantry attacked in massed formation
and penetrated the first line of
the French trenches at some points.
French infantry counter attacked with
the bayonet and drove back the Germans
in disorder.
German View of Advance.
BERLIN, via Copenhagen to London.
April 1.?The main headquarters correspondent
of the Vossische Zeitung
sends the following report on the advance
of the Germans at Malancourt:
"The thunderous work of the artillery
again furnished the prelude to a
successful resumption of infantry activity
west of the Meuse. Continuous
artillery fire suddenly increased to gigantic
violence, and like an immense
thunderstorm the explosions rattled
unceasingly across the rolling countryside.
They sounded as if a huge depot
of ammunition had exploded, detonating
thousands of shells in apparently
endless series. After several hours the
terrible melody suddenly ceased and
the assault was made successfully, with
but slight loss to the Germans.
German Position Bettered.
"The German position west of Verdun
was improved by this advance at
Malancourt. The Germans were able
to press into the village itself, and to
reach the first row of houses on the
northern side, which were the most
strongly fortified.
"I had an opportunity today to inspect
the booty so far taken in the Verdun
battle. The Quantities of weannns.
munition?, uniforms and supplies of ali j
sorts which are accumulating here are
incalculable.
"Slightly wounded men who had been
fighting west of the Meuse declare that
the struggle was severe. They seemed
surprisingly fresh and were in Jocular
humor, although they showed plain
traces of the extreme exertions through
which they had just passed."

Citizens' Federation Gets Right
to Appear Before Public
Utilities Commission.
The Federation of Citizens' Associations,
which has actively undertaken to
bring about consolidation of Washington's
street railway lines, was informed
at its meeting last night >*iat it will
be permitted to discuss this matter with
the public utilities commission Thursday.
It will be represented lit thefponference
by its public utilities committee, of
which William McK. Clayton is chairman.
Universal transfers and other
questions related to street railway
service will be considered.
At a meeting two weeks ago the
f*d*rntfnn tnnlf o??rt> J
ion rendered by Corporation Counsel
Byrne, which it considered to establish
a precedent under which the public
utilities commission could authorize
amalgamation of local street railway
lines, the impression hitherto having
existed that authority to amalgamate
could be granted only by Congress.
Through its utilities committee the
commission was approached in regard
to the matter, with the result that
Thursday's conference was arranged.
To Determine Attitude.
Some of the questions which will be
brought up at that time were discussed
at last night's meeting. The paramount
feature, of course is to determine exactly
what the commission's attitude is in
regard to amalgamation. Effort will be
made to ascertain what plans it has for
disposing of the universal transfer
agitation.
In addition, such questions as abolishing
fire stops in the interest of speeding
up schedules; half rate for school
children; ventilation in cars; dust prevention
methods, extensions and kindred
subjects will be discussed.
That the conference will be an
epochal one is generally believed. The
utilities commission Is drawing to a
close its work of valuing the properties
of Washington's public service
corporations and soon will be in a position
to act upon some of the practical
questions of public service in the
District. Because many persons have
not known that the valuation must he
the basis of any rate Orders, or other
requirements involving large expenditures
of money, the delay of the commission
1n disposing of matters that
have been the subject of nonular att\.
tation ban not been generally understood.
Thursday's conference is expected
to clarify the atmosphere considerably.
In Session Three Hours.
The federation was In session at the
Chamber of Commerce for nearly three
hours last night, during which time it
referred a number of matters to committees
and disposed of other business.
Delegate Garret of the Pinehurst association
sought to get through a resolution
favoring practically unrestricted
speed between street crossings for
the Emergency Hospital ambulances, but
Dr. Bryant, delegate from Chevy Chase,
sided "\vith the position taken by the
police department in the matter, and
the motion did not come to a vote because
of failure of Mr. Garret to get
unanimous consent for its consideration.
W. E. Fowler of Chillurn Castle
Heights spoke on the necessity of ob
mining a iwjerai appropriation for Improving
the wharves along Washington's
water front. This suggestion will
be taken up by the committee on highways.
parks and waterways, w hich will
submit a report at the next meeting on
plans for interesting Congress in this
improvement.
Resolutions Referred.
Resolutions referred to committees
were submitted by the Brightwood association
for placing the Botanic Gorden in
Rock Creek Park, near Military road
(committee on highways, parks and
waterways). Brightwood Park association
indorsing Commissioners' bill to amalgamate
street crossing policemen with
members of metropolitan force (committee
on police and fire protection), and
Bright wood Park association, indorsing
Tlnkham bill for extending the civil service
to District government positions
(committee on finance and legislation).
The federation admitted to membership
th*? North Capitol and Eckington
Citizens' Association, which will be
represented by G. Henderson.
It appointed a committee on membership

YEAR FOR PREPARATION
Evangelist Thinks Well of Campaign
Here and May Decide
Question Tomorrow.
Evangelist "Billy" Sunday may be engaged
in a big revival campaign here in
January, 1918.
This seems to be the nearest date that
he could t come to Washington and not
slight other cities which have a prior
claim on him by reason of previous invitations
and acceptances. This was
learned last night by Washingtonians
who attended Sunday's meeting in Baltimore.
George Sunday, who is in close touch
with his father, and one of his managers,
indicateed that If his father accepts
the invitation to this city he cannot
come before the date mentioned.
Washington would need at least one *
year to prepare for the meetings. It
was stated.
The question as to whether the evangelist
will say "yes" to the invitation
of the delegation of clergy and laity
representing the evangelical churches
of the city, in Foundry Church tomorrow
morning, when he comes here to
address the Baltimore annual conference
of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
was not disclosed by the Sunday organization
in Baltimore last evening.
In fact^the organization leaders declare
they have their program already arranged
up to the opening of 1918, and
any other date could hardly be discussed.
September May Be Available.
One date, "September, 1916." might be
gotten if Washington could be made
ready for it, for it is understood that
though this month has been assigned to
Detroit, there is a disposition in the
Sunday organization to substitute another
city. J
"We are due at Kansas City, Mo., at
Easter," said George Sunday last evening,
"and we will conclude there June
19. Then, after the summer vacation,
we will be in Boston beginning October
1. There a long campaign is
planned and may last until Christmas.
From there we go to New York city
for a campaign from January to Easter
hi 1917. Buffalo is next on tl^e list from
Easter until the close of our season.
We plan to begin a campaign in Chicago
early in October. This last campaign,
it i* believed, will easily last
until Christmas of 1917. J
Evangelist Sunday, it is known,
thinks well of a campaign here, and
many are of the opinion that he will
say "yes" Monday.
Many of these who are of the opinion
that he will give a favorable answer to

DR. WAITE ALLEGED
TO HAVE CONFESSED
New York World Prints Letter
Purporting to Be Admission
He Killed Peck.
SAYS CHARGE IS JUST
AND HE EXPECTS TO DIE
His Attorney Said to Have Sanctioned
the Publication?Statement
of Seasons.
NEW YORK. April 2. (Sunday).?
What purports to be a formal confession
by Dr. Arthur Warren Waite that
le murdered his father-in-law, John E.
Peck of Grand Rapids, is printed this
Tiorning by the New York World. The
onfession is said to have been contained
in a letter sent to the newspaper
jy Waite. Accompanying: it is another
letter signed by Walter Rogers Deuel.
Waite's counsel, in which he is quoted
is saying Waite desired to make his
statement "To unburden his soul somewhat
from the heavy load upon It as
the only thing he could do in atonenent."
Extract From Waite's Letter.
The letter said to have been signed
jy \Vaite follows, in part:
"I have been informed that 1 have
seen indicted for the crime of murder
n the first degree. I know the punshment
is death.
"The indictment is just and the penalty
is one that T deserve, for I have
killed John E. Peck.
"I have thought and thought while
lying in my bed here in the hospital.
[ have gone over all the incidents of
:he past few months of my life, and I
lave made my peace with my creator.
[ now desire to make atonement for the
ivrong that I have done.
"It is a terrible grief to me that I
should have brought obliquity and
shame upon my wife and upon the
mrne of my good parents and made my
brothers to suffer as they do.
"I am relieved to make this, my confession."
Statement by Attorney Deuel.
Mr. Deuel is quoted as having said
le did not advise against the publicaion
of Waite's letter. He is declared
>y the World to have authorized the
statement that Waite had confessed to
lim that his murder plan included "the
rillincr r?f Mr f? nrl M> a Inkn "C
lis wife (Mrs. Arthur Warren Waite)
tnd any one else who should happen to
itand between him and the Peck milions."
Doesn't Realiez What He Did.
It is only just to Dr. Waite to state."
dr. Deuel is quoted as saying, "that he
loes not now have any real realization
?f what he has done, in my opinion
tnd in the opinion of others who have
'isited him since he was taken to Belevue
Hospital. I have said that no deense
would be made on the facts?that
he defense conceded the murder of Mr.
Jeck. Therefore, as his counsel, 1 have
jermitted him to make the statement

Col. Dodd's Difficult Task.
Although the pursuit by the Americans
is a new experience for Villa, one he has
never met in all his years of guerrilla
warfare, arin^rnen here are not inclined
to minimize the task before Col. Dodd.
The Guerrero district in which Villa,
with a price on his head, was able for
eight years to escape capture by Porflrio
IMaz's rurales, abounding, as it does, in
caves, canyons and almost impassable
mountain trails, all screened from the
eyes of air scouts by heavy growths of
mountain pines, is admittedly one of the
most isolated regions in Mexico, and the
one in which the bandit has the largest
number of friends.
From the moment the news of the battle
was announced the greatest excite
ment has prevailed in Columbus, the town
which Villa attacked less than three
weeks ago. and in which he murdered
eight civilians and seven American cavalrymen.
Scores of persons, civilians and soldiers
gathered around the army wireless station
expecting momentarily the news
would be flashed through the air that he
had been captured and was being brought
to Columbus. Some suggested that even
if Villa is captured it would be unwise
to bring him across the border because
of the feeling of the people.
Sorry Plight of Captured Horses.
Something of this sentiment was expressed
at a sale of thirty-four Villa
mounts captured by American troopers
after the raid on Columbus. Men gazed
at the pitiful wrecks of what once were
stout cow ponies, the bones of which even
three weeks of American grain had been
unable to conceal, and at the flanks,
which had been cut into strips by cruelly
roweled spurs, and cursed the bandits who
had owned the animals. The jibes of the
auctioneer, who pointed to one sorry animal
and said: "He must have been a
good one, see, he looks like they'd all
taken turns at riding him," aroused no
response. The prices obtained for the animals
ranged from $4.50 to $20, and this

Finding Bodies of Bandits
After Battle.
SAN ANTONIO. Tex.. April 1.?Villa's
loss in dead at the battle with Americans
at Guerrero Wednesday was
placed at sixty by Gen. Pershing today
in a report to Gen. Funston.
I The bodies were found in houses in
Guerrero and scattered in the underbrush
for miles along the routes taken
by the fleeing Mexicans. Villa himself
was believed to be northeast of Guerrero,
but Gen. Pershing expressed the
opinion that there was little chance of
his escape.
Detachments from four regiments of
cavalry had been disposed in such manner
that the district where he had been
reported was practically surrounded,
and every point of escape carefully

Gen. Pershing's report was dated
I "March 31-April 1," causing army officers
here to believe it was written yesterday,
but not filed until today.
Additional details of the fighting
about Guerrero were not given by Gen.
Pershing, but he said yesterday that a
snowstorm sweeping over the San
Geronimo ranch, a region of high
elevation, had made the operations of
the troops more difficult and exceedingly
uncomfortable for the soldiers. ,
From Customs Collector Cobb at El
Paso Gen. Funston received a communication
saying that an American J
from Mexico had reported to him that i
Villa's men had killed a German named
Blankenahip and two Americans whose
names he did not know on Mareh 27 at 1

Lieut. Col. Frick, in charge of the hospital
here, said tonight he had received
no information concerning the four
American troopers wounded in the San'
Geronimo engagement.
Confidence of Gen. Funston's Staff.
SAN ANTONIO. Tex.. April 1? Absence
of news from the district about Guerrero
did not diminish the belief at Gen. Funston's
headquarters that possibly Villa,
himself had been captured.
A written report from Gen. Pershing
sent two days before the fight at Guerrero
was received. This dealt onl> with ,
the details of the troops' disposition since
crossing the border, and the difficulties
had encountered in getting his supplies
and in maintaining communications. He
reported that the engineering forces were
working on the road north of t'asas
Grandes and on that part extending
southward toward Namiquipa The roads
south of Casas Grandes were reported in
better condition than those to the north.
He also called attention to the fact that
the aeroplanes are equipped with engines
of too low power.
Press dispatches telling of a report from
Chihuahua that Villa had been captured
at Minaca, only a few miles south of
Guerrero, were unconfirmed by official
reports, but there was no disposition to
belittle it. Gen. Funston was convinced
of the truth of the report that Villa was
badly wounded prior to the fight at
Guerrero, and it was believed that his
escape was now highly improbable.
