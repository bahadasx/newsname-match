GERMANY SAYS
NO INFORMATION
ON EXPLOSIONS
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, April 1 The Ger
man government has informed am
bassador Gerard that it is without
official confirmation concerning the
explosions which damaged the British
Channel steamer Sussex and sunk the
British horse ship Englishman, both
of which were carrying American
citizens.
In a dispatch dated Thursday and
reaching the state department today
Mr. Gerard said the German govern
ment had only, newspaper report on
the two cases and was making an in
vestigation which might be concluded
within three or four days. The .Ber
lin foreign office promised to In
form Mr. Gerard when the inquiry is
completed. It is realized here it may
be a week before all the German sub
marine commanders who might have
been concerned had opportunity to
report.
Meanwhile the state department's
own investigation into the cases of
the Sussex and the other- ships which,
while carrying American citizens, re
cently have been overtaken by dis
aster, will be continued. Secretary
Lansing said, today he had received
no new dispatches of importance but
additional information is hourly ex
pected.
While the situation still is a wait
ing one, it is apparent that many of
ficials view the accumulation of cir
cumstantial evidence as indicating al
most to the point of proof that Ger
man submarines have violated the
itiuiij uiil. solemn assurances given the united

The Germans are gradually closing
in on Verdun, drawing their lines a
little closer northeast of the fortress,
where by massed attack from two di
rections they have secured a footing
in the village of Vaux.
Their successful attempt to pene
trate the French lines was preceded,
according to Paris, by an assault that
was checked by the French curtain of
fire and the infantry, and there was
spirited fighting at close quarters be
fore the crown prince's forces finally
succeeded in pressing part way into the
village.
The German infantry has not moved
from its trenches west of the Meuse
since the capture of Malancourt, fol
lowed shortly by the unsuccessful drive
at the French positions northeast of
Hill No. 295, 'in the region of Dead
Man's Hill. The artillery, hfcwever,
continues active in the Malancourt re
gion, and further attempts by the Ger
mans to continue their drive on the
French left flank are considered prob
able to occur without much delay.
The German official statement refers
only incidentally to the fighting about
Verdun, mentioning - only artillery
duels there and in the Argonne with
other activity by the big guns on the
Aisno front and further north on the
line. A British hand grenade attack
near St. Eloi, where the Germans re
cently lost some ground, was repulsed.
The aviators on both sides of the
Fra,neo-Beigian front have been busy
Four French machines fell victims to
German aircraft in various engage
ments.
After a period of bad weather, fight
ing has been resumed on the Austro-
Italian front. 'For the most part, how
ever, the activities are confined to ar
tillery engagements and such infantry
clashes as have occurred have not re
suited In changes of positions.
Berlin summarizes the recent Rus
sian offensive, now apparently at a
standstill, as barren of results for Em
peror Nicholas's forces, while the Rus
srteji casualties are estimated by the
German headquarters staff to have
been at least 140,000. More than 500,
000 men were engaged on the Russian
side, according to Berlin, and the ex
penditure of ammunition by the at
tacking forces is declared to have been

Olivine, commanded by Lieutenant
William R. 'Mackintosh, royal naval
reserve, but naval men-freely concede
that the credit for bringing the Zep
pelin down belongs to on of the land
batteries, which may be described as
stationed in an eastern county. '
The Zeppelin came down in the
broad mouth of the Thames, soon
after three o'clock Saturday morning.
That stretch of water as well as the
adjoining coast waters swarms with
patrol craft. The airship's back had
been broken by gunfire. Her gon
dolas were riddled with shrapnel bul

wounded, Her commander had suf

the descent of the Zeppelin.
"The. sea was smooth and the night
was cool and dark, so the trawler was
able to take aboard wounded as well
as tinwounded. Some of the crew
were at the top of the balloon while
the wounded and their attendants
remained In the baskets below.
After all the survivors were aboard
the Olivine, the crew of the trawler
pitached a cable to the Zeppelin In
the hope that they would bo able to
bring the prize to port, but towing
was difficult, as the airship had brok

powers have reason to be uneasy
about them. They are dictated mere
ly by prudence in view of the ap
parently increased possibility that
Holland might eventually become in
volved in the war and Have no other
purpose than to further maintenance
of strictest neutrality.
The foregoing is the substance of
information received by Baron Gev
ers, the Dutch minister to Germany,
this morning, with instructions to
communicate it to the German foreign
office. The Baron went immediately
to the foreign office upon receipt of
his instructions. The Dutch minister
emphasized the fact that the meas
ures only were dictated by prudence
and indicated no intention on the part
of Holland to change its course.
Private advices reaching here from
Holland connect the new measures
directly with the discussions at the
Paris conference of the entente allies
regarding their future economic atti
tude toward Holland.
The Associated Press learns that
the new situation indicated by Hoi
land's increased watchfulness is re
garded not only without uneasiness
but even with a certain degree of
satisfaction in official German circles.

WASHINGTON. April 1 The senate-
debated the army increase bill again all
day today without any indication as to
when work would begin on the mass of
pending amendments. As yet Senator
Chamberlain, chairman of the military
committee, has made no effort to limit
general discussion, which began yester
day, as it probably will continue sever
al days at least before amendments are
taken up.
Senator Borah told the senate he had
found an insurmountable constitutional
barrier against the proposal in the bill
for federalization of the national guard.
He gave many legal citations to support
his cqntention that under the constitu
tion congress has no power to enforce
the discipline it has authority to pre
scribe. Should any state refuse to ap
point officers or to train national
guardsmen, he said, congress would be
without any recourse. It could neither
have training for the guardsmen itself
or compel the state to act, and it could
not empower the president to anoint
officers or compel the state to appoint
them.
Senator Cummins and Senator Lewis
sharply disagreed with Senator Borah.
Senator Lewis attacked the senate bill
provision for a force of federal volun
teers, saying it was aimed at the na
tional guard and would destroy it if
enacted. The Illinois senator aserted
that the ambition of regular army offi
cers to rise to deserved promotions was
holly responsible for the volunteer
army proposal. Because the nhtion was
resolved not to maintain a large stand
ing army and since the constitution
barred these graduates of West Point
from commands in the national guard.
e said, they naturally sought an ave
nue of escape.
Senator Pomerene defended his
amendment proposing creation of a na
tional guard section of the army gen
eral staff. While regular officers looked
ith disfavor on the guard, he said, no
accurate report as to the guard's con-
ition and fitness could be expected
from them. Only by appointing national
guard officers to the staff, he added,
could the full use of the state soldiers
he assurred.
Senator Brandege added to the mass
of amendments now pending a proposal
to make the maximum peace strength
of the army 250,000 instead of 180,000
as proposed in this bill. Senator Gore
submitted as an amendment his bill
proposingthat a military training
course be provided for any high school
with an attendance of more than fifty
boys above 16 years of age, the govern
ment to pay two fifths of the salary of
military instructor. More than 100,-
000 boys could be brought under train
ing in this way, he said.
Another feature of national prepared
ness was considered today by the house
commerce commission with Secretary
Redfield testifying in support of the
lighthouse appropriation bill.
The secretary said the 25 seagoing
buoy boats now in service would be
available as mine layers or sweepers
in time of war. Their drag equipment
for locating pinnacle rocks, he added,
would be invaluable for mine sweep
ing or to trap hostile submarines.
The house naval comimttee was not
in session. Secretary Daniels Is ex
pected to continue his testimony Mon
day when the hearings will be brought
to a close. Chairman Padgett hopes
to have the navy bill before the house
two weeks later.

COLUMBUS, N. M., April 1. Riding
mercilessly, four hundred American
troopers under Colonel George A.
Dodd, are making desperate efforts to
capture or wipe out the, survivors of
Francisco Villa's largest command,
which they defeated at San Geronimo
ranch several days ago, according to
meagre reports seeping across the
border today.
The speed and the relentlessness
with which the pursuit is being made
is indicated, according to army men
here, by the fact that General Persh
ing, who last reports said, was speed
ing from Namiquipa across desert
trails and through mountain passes
to the scene of action, has not even
taken time to make a detailed report
of the engagement. Nor was any word
received from Colonel Dodd, although
service at the army wireless station
here, interrupted by climatic condi
tions, was resumed today.
Military headquarters here made
this statement:
"No details of the engagement have
been received. The only messages re
ceived from the south were of purely
routine nature and in .none of them
was the engagement mentioned."

EL PASO, April 1. The story of the
murder of three Americans, a German
and an Englishman at Minaca was
brought here today by Americans arriv
ing from Chihuahua City and was ac
cepted as authentic by Federal officials.
The bandits victims were Benjamin
Snell, Dr. A. T. Stell, Lee Lindesley,
Americans; Herman Blankenburg, a
German; Donald McGregor, also known
as Bruce, a British subject. Two other
Americans, Henry Acklin and Frank
Woods, were in Minaca at the time
but their fate is unknown. The news
was brought to Chihuahua City by J.
H. Locke, the only American known to
have escaped the massacre.
According to the story, Villa cap
tured Minaca, Guerrero and San Isidro
last Monday. Everywhere he went he
announced his intention of putting to
death every "gringo" that fell into his
hands and he carried out his intention.
As far as the Mexicans were concerned
the bandits promised safety to all those
who did not take up arms against him.
No quarter was shown to Carranza
troops who attempted to resist him.
The one gleam of light in the dark
story is the probability that Villa's lust
of blood is what enabled Colonel Dodd
to deliver his crushing blow' at San
Geronimo ranch two days after the
crime of Minaca, a blow that has raised
hife'h hopes that the bloodthirsty bri
gand's days are no numbered.
According to the refugees, General
Luis Herrera left Chihuahua early on
Tuesday with a large number of troops.
His destination was not made public.
There were numerous reports in El
Paso today that Villa was already cap
tured. Some of these were very cir
cumstantial but not one of them was
capable of verification. The wish be
ing father to the thought was appar
ently the basis for most of the stories.
It was in the raid on Guerrero last
Monday that Villa was wounded, being
shot in the knee, according to a mes
sage received today by General Gayira
at Juarez from General Gutierrez, tel
egraphing from Chihuahua City. Gavira
had asked for further information, about
Colonel Dodd's battle.
Gutierrez explained that the wires
were working badly on the Southern
loop and he had only the bare details
of what had happened. But the tele
gram received said that Villa broke in
to Guerrero at three o'clock Monday
morning. The garrison engaged the as
sailants in heavy street fighting. A
number were killed on both sides. Then
the V illistas looted the stores. Villa
was wounded in the knee.
Telegrams from Chihuahua City in
Juarez today said that a freight and a
passenger train on the Northwestern
railroad had been wrecked some weeks
ago between Minaca and Chihuahua
City.
Twenty-seven Mexicans, including
women and children were killed. One
American was on board but uninjured.
The same advices said that the pay
master of El Potosi mining company
had been robbed by bandits three miles
from Chihuahua City three days ago
there were twenty in the band and
they let the paymaster go after taking
seven hundred pesos from him.
Benjamin Snell, one of the Villa's
victims, came from Kansas City, where

April 1 (By aeroplane to field head
quarters and by wireless to Colum

cavalrymen under Colonel George A.
Dodd of finding Francisco Villa
among the snow clad slopes of the
centinental divide are based on the
discovery today of the track of car
riage wheels in the mountainous
wate near here.
These, it is believed jnay have been
made by the vehicle which carried
au-ay the injured bandit leader.
Ever since they defeated the Villa
command at San Geronimo ranch
with heavy lesses last Wednesday,
the American cavalrymen have
searched ceaselessly for the bandit
leader, but up to late today no defin
ite information concerning his where
abouts had reached this camp.
Villa has disappeared in a way,
which considering the relentlessness
of the American pursuit seems mys
terious. The American troops have
not encountered any natives who will
even admit they have seen Villa.
Every gorge, canyon train and wa
tering place in the mountainous pass
es in this vicinity Is being watched
by American air scouts or searched
by cavalrymen in the hope of dis
covering the bandit's lair. The avi
ators also are keeping the column in
formed as to the movements of tho
scattred remnants of the band. Hope
is expressed that one of these, at
least, may attempt to rejoin their
chief and thus lead the American
forces to his hiding place.

The bodies were found in houses In

by the fleeing Mexicans. Villa himself
was believed to be northeast of Guer

the opinion that there was little chance
of his escape, for detachments from
four regiments of cavalry had been dis
posed in such manner that tle district
where he had beei' reported was prac
tically surrounded and every point of
escape carefully gitarded.
General Tershinrs report was dated
March 31 April .1," causing army of
ficers here to believe it was written
yesterday but not filed until today.
Additional details of the fighting
about Guerrero were not given by
General Pershing, but he said yester
day that a snowstorm swept over the
San Geronimo ranch, a region of high
elovallon and had made the operations
of the troops more difficult and ex

diers, who wore moving with light
equipment.

Hope for Early Capture
WASHINGTON, April 1. Although
no word cany? through today from
General Pershing's expeditionary force
in Mexico, there was a growing con
fidence here that the expedition was
rapidly nearing, if it had not already
reached, its climax. Three days have
passed since Colonel Dodd's cavalry
dash at Guerrero scattred Villa's main
band and establihsed definitely the
preserice in that locality of Villa him
self, and .army officers are certain
that the American troopers did not
allow the trail to grow cold.
The hope for early capture of the
bandit chief was increased tonight by
a rumor reaching General Gavira,
Carranza commander at Juarez, that
Dodd s flying column netted the fugi
tive. The war department had no in- '
formation to confirm the report. Of
ficials pointed out however, that Gen
era Gavira had news of the Guerrero
fight hours before General Pershing's
account reached General Funston.
The Carranza authorities have con
trol of the telegraph lines and with
Carranza troops operating near Guer
rero, have facilities for prompt re
ports on the American operations.
A night watch was maintained tonight-
at the war department in the
hope that further dispatches from
Pershing would be received. Secre
tary Baker wired General Funston to
endeavor to get further details of
the Guerrero engagement.
Colonel Dodd is far from a point of
communication, at least 50 or 75 miles.
While he probably halted his troops,
for a brief respite, after their 55
mile dash followed by a running fight
of five hours, officers here do not
believe he tarried. lon. Difficulty In
securing supplies and water at their
distance from the main t-ommand of
General Pershing may have handi-

the reference was to the American caPPel him, but probably did hot de
