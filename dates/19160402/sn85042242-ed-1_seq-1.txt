Stormy Session at Minot in
Youmans Case and Fight
Narrowly Averted
PLAINTIFF ADMITS THAT
HE WAS REGULAR ROBBER
Did Not Reform Until Minot
Bankers "Tried to Kill Him
Off," He Said
Minot, April 1.—When Francis J.
Murphy forced Grant Youmans to ad­
mit that lie was only a common rob­
ber, a book sailed through the air, re
miniscent of the I. W. W. riots here
some time ago. The assistant attor­
ney general conies of lighting blood
and cooly dodged the book and began
a cross examination that, forced the
witness into all kinds of humiliating
admissions.
Tin.' trial lias reached a point wiiere
most, people regard it as farcical and
it is believed that, the matter will not.
reach the jury.
Wants Manahan's Gall.
In one of many tills uel.ween Sena­
tor Pureell and James .Manahan, the
senator said:
"1 have a request thai wish you
would giant, and that is that, when
you die you would will nie your salt,
for if 1 had a hunch ol' gall like thai
1 could put a nickel's worth on a jack
rabbit's tail and he would be brave
enough io light a bull clog."
This war of words was one of I he
many interesting ones thill, opened
up the afternoon session. During the
excitement of the morning session At­
torneys Manahan and Le oeuer, at­
torneys for plaintiff, jumped to thejr
feet, expecting to take hand in the
trouble. When Youmans threw tue
book at Attorney Murphy, ex-Senator
Pureell. attorney for defendants,
jumped to his feer to assist his col
league. y.-•
Shouts At Pureell.
Mr. Youmans, now on the defensive,
ordered Mr. Pureell to stay away
frorti hita. Mr. Pureell told Mr. You­
mans that he was a different man,
and that he would not sit down for
witftess. 'For a time it looked as if a
number of attorneys would get into
a scrimmage, but the court called on
the sheriff to restore order. During
the cross-examination of Mr. You­
mans, it has come out that Mr. Ghent
was one of the I. W. W.'s who helped
to cause trouble at Minot two years
ago and that he was used as a dummy
by Mr. Youmans in his translations.
That others of the same ilk were used
in a like capacity.
The afternoon session was called at
1:45 o'clock, but before 1:00 o'clock
the court room was crowded and 20
minutes before Judge Kneeshaw took
his seat it was impossible to get
standing room. The people were
dravn to the court room expecting to
see spectacular plays. When You­
mans took his seat he appeared some­
what nervous and seemed to be very
much on the defensive and cautious
in answering questions.
In Lively Tilt.
Attorneys Murphy and Manahan
opened the fireworks of the afternoon
by engaging in a tilt regarding look­
ing up of land renting record and
were cautioned by the court. The
cross-examination will probably take
several days longer, as each of the se­
curities which were in the savings
deposit bank will be fully covered and
'the defense will attempt to show that
the same were fraudulent and that
the banking board was fully justified
in the action they took relative to the
hank.
Mr. Youmans was given a very
gruelling examination relative to se­
curities, taking up the sum of $22.(WlO
which Mr. Youmans admitted was car*
ried by the bank at the time the ex­
aminer closed it.
Mr. Murphy, in his cross examina­
tion of plaintiff, was goin through
each one of these securities. Mr.
Youmaqs admitted that, on the day
the transaction took place his savings
loan and trust company, Mr. Gagne
executed mortgages which were ac­
cepted as prior mortgages on land. At
one time during the examination Mr.
Youmans lost his temper and a scene
such as is seldom seen enacted in the
court room took place. Following is
a verbatim report or the examination
at that point:
Q. Is that another banker's trick
in buying real estate that way?
A. Simply another banker's meth­
od of making land available for com­
mercial purposes.
Q. A banker's trick of making land
available for commercial purposes?
A. I won't answer that.
Q. You won't answer that?
iA.. No.
Q. You decline to answer it?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Because it contains the word
"trick?"
A. I answered your question.
Just A Trick.
Q. I'm asking you another ques­
tion, if it wasn't a banker's trick to
make the laid available for commer­
cial purpose!?

Dickinson, X. D., April 1.—The Nor­

the machine shop, is on fire and in
spite of all that firemen have been
able to do, the main part of the struc­
ture is a total wreck. Five engines,
including two of the heavy passen­

stalls. Fortunately, there is no, wind
and it looks as though the firemen
would be able to save the south row
of stalls and a few in the old part of
the east side. Railroad men think
that fire caught from defective eloc
tric wires. Loss is estimated from
one to two hundred thousand.

The confession is said to have been

W. E. Lahr, president, of the Lahr

to obtain delivery of Overland cars.
Mr. Lahr was successful to the ex­
tent of twenty carloads or an even
hundred ©verlands, which are com­
ing through to his firm as fast as
they can be loaded. While this is
quite a lot of cars, Mr. Lahr states
it will take care of less than one
third of -his dealers, who are clamor­
ing for deliveries. In speaking fur­
ther of the enormous demand for Ov­
erland cars, iMr. Lahr said that his

•Washington, April 1.—The senate
debated the army increase bill again
today without, any indication as to
when work would begin on the mass
of pending amendments. As yet,
Senator Chamberlain, chairman of
the military committee, has made no
effort to limit the general discussion
which began yesterday, and it prob­
ably will continue several days.
Insurmountable Barriers.
Senator Borah told the senate lie
bad found an insurmountable barrier
against the proposal in the bill for
federalization of the National Guard.
lie gave many legal citations to sup­
port his contention that under the
Constitution, Congress lias no power
to enforce the discipline it lias au­
thority to prescribe. Should any
slate refuse to appoint otlicers, or to
train National Guardsmen, lie sair.
Congress would be without any re­
course. II could neither provide for
thf1 training of the guardsmen itself,
or compel Hie slate to act, and it
could not empower Ihe president to
appoint officers nor compel the stale
to appoint, them.
Use as Mine Layers.
Another feature of national prepar­
edness was considered today by the
house Military committee, with Secre­
tary Redfield testifying in support of
the lighthouse bill. The secretary
said the 25 seagoing buoy boats now
in service would be available as mine
layers or sweepers in time of war.
Their drag .equipment fgr locating
pinnacle rocks, lie added, would be
invaluable for mine sweeping or to
trap hostile submarines.
The house 'Naval committee was
not in session. Secretary Daniels is
expected to conclude his testimony
.Monday, when the hearings will be
brought, to a close. Chairman Pad­
gett hopes to have the navy bill be­
fore the house two days later.
Reject $400,000 Amendment.
The first attempt, to add new pro­
jects to the $4(),€00,000 rivers and
harbors appropriation bill failed in
the house today when an amendment
by Representative Teaue, to approp­
riate $400,000 for a forty-foot channel
from President Roads at Boston to
the sea, was rejected overwhelming­
ly. House leaders professeed to see
in the vote, a forecast that the com­
mittee's recommendations against the
new projects would be approved and
that the bill would pass virtually as
reported.
Recent developments in connection
with the prosecution of neutrality
cases, and the turn taken by the
Mexican situation have further im
pressed officials here of the necessi
ty for extending the country'c neu
trality laws, and a recommendation
for revision may be made to congress
within a few weeks by the Neutrality
board.
Since the European war began, the
department of Justice officials have
felt handicapped by a lack of stat
utes under which to prosecute cases
in which the evidence itself was
abundant. Many neutrality prosecu
tions ,have been brought under the
Sherman anti-trust law's conspiracy
section, but the department regards
that round-about way eentirely in
capable of application to some cases
where prosecutions under a more
specific statute would result, in con
vict ion.

FOR GAS PUNT
Buys Equipment For Bismarck
At Fort Wayne,
Indiana
Fori Wayne, lnd., April 1.—An­
other large contract has been landed
by Ihe Western Gas Construction com­
pany of this city with the signing up
of articles last Saturday for a large
plant at, Bismarck, N. ,D. Frank E.
Ployhar, president of the Valley City,
N. D., Gas company, was in Fort
Wayne, and signed up with the local
concerp for. the plant, which -wlLLbavu
a daily capacity of 125,000 cubic feet.
The .Bismarck plant will be up-to
date in every respect, equipped with
Ihe most modern machinery, and ar­
ranged for future extension. The sta­
tion equipment will represent, an ex­
penditure of $-10,0111), all of which will
he furnished by the Western Gas.
This does not. include foundation,
buildings or street mains.
Five or six years ago the Ft. Wayne
company erected a large plant for Mr.
Ployhar al. Valley City. This plant,
has proven so satisfactory that he
turned to the Western C.as at. once
when he obtained a franchise in Bis­
marck.
Negotiations between the North Da­
kota man and the local firm have
been pending several months. As a
result, Mr. Ployhar was enabled to
get the gas plant machinery here at
more nearly the reasonable price
which prevailed a few months ago
instead of being subjected to the
price penalty encountered from org­
anization delay, at flush times like
the present.
CELEBRATED RATE
CASEREOPENED
Hearing the Matter Will Begin
March 14. Involves Through
Frieght Charges
Washington, April 1.—The celebrat­
ed inter-mountain rate case, begun in
1911 and uisposed of three years lat­
er in the supreme court, was re-open­
ed today by the I. C. C. on petition
of the Spokane-Merchants association
and Ihe Nevada railroad commission.
Hearings will begin here April 14, and
a decision will be rendered as speed­
ily as possible.
Involves Freight Rates.
The case involves the railroads'
rights to charge heigher rates on
many commodities from Atlantic
coast eilies to points west of Denver
than are charged on the through-haul
from coast, to coast. Pacific coast,
points now enjoying low through
rates to the disadvantage, it is claim­
ed, of intermediate points between
Denver and the Pacific, are San Fran­
cisco, Seattle, Portland, Vancouver
and San Pedro, the port' of Los Ange­
les.
No Need to Discriminate.
Radical changes in transportation
conditions due mainly to the Europe­
an war and the closing of the Panama
canal by slides has eliminated compe­
tition between transcontinental rail­
roads and steamship lines, the peti­
tioners declare, so there is no longer
necessity for discriminating in inter­
mediate points so such competition
has to be met.

Headquarters Report.
Military headquarters here made
this statement:
"No details of the engagement have
been received. The only messages
received from the south were of pure­
ly routine nature and in none of them
was the engagement mentioned."
Although the pursuit by the Ameri­
cans is a new experience for Villa*
one he has never met in all bis years
of guerrila warfare, army men here
are not inclined to minimize the task
before Col. Dodd.
Excitement Prevailed.
From the moment the news of the
battle was announced, the greatest
excitement has prevailed in Colum­
bus, the town which Villa attacked
less than three weeks ago and in
which he murdered eight civilians
and seven American cavalrymen.
Something of this sentiment was
expressed at a sale of 34 Villa mounts
captured by American troopers after
the raid on Columbus.
$4.50 to 920.00
The prices obtained for the animals
ranged from $4.50 to $20.00, and thiri
despite the fact that there were the
best horses captured, the others being
in such condition that it was neces­
sary to kill them.
"I wouldn't have one of those pon*
ies about my place," said a rancher
who Angered with his cartridge belt
as he watched the sale. "The poor
skates would always remind me of
my friends killed at Columbus."
