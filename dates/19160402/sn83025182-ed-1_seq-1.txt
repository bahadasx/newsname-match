SAN ANTONIO, Texas, April L—
Pancho Villa's biding place northeast
of Guerrero has been surrounded and
1,000 American cavalrymen are clos
ing In.
A message dated San Geronimo
ranch, March 31, reoeived by General
Funston late tonight, stated that
Villa undoubtedly is in the country
northeast of Guerrero that American
troops surround the region and that
four squadrons of cavalry, selected
from three regiments, are closing in.

scene of Wednesday's battle confirms
the belief of army officers here that
Colonel Dodd came upon the bandits
from the south and indicates that the
southern chase is over. Unless he
can slip through the encircling- Unit
ed States soldiers, the purpose of the
American punitive expedition will soon
be accomplished. The number of
American cavalrymen in the rogion—
four squadrons—indicates that an
effort to fight his way out would be
hopeless.
The doubling of Villa's casualty list
Indicates that Colonel Dodd wiped out
nearly one sixth of Villa's entire
force in the first engagement. To
day's dispatch shows that Dodd has
been reinforced.
That Villa's force has been aug

likely. Rather, It is believed to have
dwindled through desertions follow

mouth of the Thames. There were
rumors at midnight that a Zeppelin
had been brought down for the first
time In an air raid on England.
Newspaper extras with the admir
alty's official announcement were
eagerly grabbed up.
Half a dozen searchlights picked
the Zeppelin out of the darkness
less than half an hour after her ap
proach had been reported. She
mounted higher to escape shells from
anti-air craft guns, discharging bombs
as she climbed.
The glare from the searchlights
made the L-15 and tae puffs of smoke
accompanying bursting shells easily
visible, despite the airship's great
height. Scores of persons declared
they saw smoke coming from the
dirigible Just before she turned and
fled toward the coast.
The captured crew of the L-15 said
she was struck by a shell near tho
stern, settled slowly approaching the
coast and plunged suddenly to the
water from a height of about 200
feet. Either from the L-15 or from
another Zeppelin a machine gun,
some ammunition and a petrol tank
were dropped on the Kent coast.
Several of the forty-four persons
Injured by Zeppelins bombs are in a
serious condition. It is probable that
the death list will be increased to
above thirty.
The crew of the Zeppeun was
picked «p by the British trawler Oli
vine, on patrol duty off the mouth of
tne Thames. Several of the Germans
had been slightly injured when the
big bag collapsed.
The Olivine transferred the prison
ers to a destroyer which put into
Chatham in order that the wounded
Germans might obtain medical treat
ment.

PARIS, April 1.—Resuming the nut
cracker tactics, the crown prince has
advance of his right wing northwest
of Verdun.
The Germans gained a foothold In
the western outskirts of the village
of Vaux, five miles northeast of Ver
dun early today after suffering heavy
losses. The Teutons came under a
terrible flre from Fort Vaux In their
first attempt against the village along
the Vaux brook and were slaughtered
In large numbers.
The second attack preceded by a
terrific artillery bombardment drove
the French back upon the center of
the village in a four hour struggle.
Despite the fury of the German at
tack, French officers do not believe
the crown prince is shifting his most
powerful offensive to the northeast
ern front of Verdun. They are cer
tain the next forty-eight hours will
see a resumption of the attacks on
the west bank of the Meuae en a
grand scale.
The Germans, having oeeupied Mal
ancourt, must shortly launch heavy
assaults against Hill 304, or relin
quish the village they won at heavy
cost of life. French batteries around
Dead Man hill and on Hill 304 have
I laid Malancourt under terrifio fire
night and day since it fell into Ger
man hands. The Germans must
either advance or retire from the
position.
For an entire week Hill 304, the
keystone of the French defensive
system outside northwestern forts
has been shelled systematically each
day by the Germans. The bombard
ment was particularly Intense
throughout yesterday, as though Indi
cating the beginning of an Infantry
attack.
FIERCE ATTACKS..
PARIS, April 1.—Continuing his
tHJve on 'the east bank of the Meuae,
the crown prince today attempted to
pierce the French' center by fierce at
taoks In the ravine tying between
Vaux village and Fort Douaumont.
The Germans were caught by
heavy fire of French guns at Fort
Vaux and artillery on the heights
near Feury. The assault was com
pletely stopped by the French cur
tain of fire, the war office announced.
On the west bank of the Meuse, the
German bombardment grew more in
tense today between Malancourt and
Avocourt, Indicating the renewal of
the German attempt to thrust east
ward in a flanking attack on Hill 304.

Pending completion of the official

here that the 8ussex struck a mine.
It was pointed out, however, that the
Sussex was for some time in service

As for the meeting in New York,
they say. It forecast arrangements
whereby Roosevelt will pick up New

To gain this strength, politicians
believe the colonel will cease em

conditions as a means of national ef

ted there is much oiling to be done
and several major ports of the works
to be adjusted.
Among the Immediate problems, is
selectiv'u of a secretary to the nation
al committee to succeed the late
Thomas J. Pence. Two men have
been mentioned as possibilities, Matt
Ely, postmaster of Jersey City, N. J.,
and W. R. Holllster, Senator Stone's

The view generally held hero Is
that the Dutch government Is con
vinced that Germany has embarke I
on a new campaign on submarine de
struction and will mobollze her forces
to warn the kaiser against attacks ou
Dutch shipping.
The Dutch newspaper Xlew Cour
ant. however, throw an entirely dif
ferent light on the situation in an edi
torial today.
"The measures taken by the govern
ment do not grow out of the Tnbantia
sinking nor is there any imminent
danger of war." said the Cotirant.
The government, however, has re
ceived information which requires
special consideration, apparently as
the result of tho allied economic con
ference at Paris. Parliament prob
ably will meet in spenrial session oil
Tuesday."
Because of interruption of direct
cable communication between Eng
land and Holland, few news dis
patches filtered through from Dutch
sources tonight. It was impossible,
therefore, to learn which of the op
posing views is correct. The Dutcb
legation had no comment to make.
Tlif Dutch army since the beginning
of the war, has been partially mobo
llzed to protect Holland neutrally. In
case Holland should enter the war on
either side, it is estimated she could
throw nearly 400,000 trained troops
