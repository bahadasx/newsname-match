"Don't vole for the tariff or

but for Tulsa!"
TIIK expose In yesterday morn
ing's World of the attempt to
perpetrate wholesale registration
frauds by circulating blank ranis that
would enable the holders to register
by mail, has done the Democrats more
harm than good. Prominent men in
both parties yesterday expressed in
dignation over this apparent attempt
to foist an unfair political scheme up
on the honest voters of the city.
So far as can be learned not many
registration certificates have been is
sued on the strength of cards sent by
mail, but two or three Inspectors ad
mitted having received them. De
tectives are at w.ii'k and are deter
mined to find the source of this plan
and bring the guilty persons to Jus
tice. The registration yesterday moved
rather slowly, but thanks to the
ulertness of scores of honest citizens,
practically every voter entitled to rcg
Ister was permitted to do so by the
Democratic precinct Inspectors. The
registration books were closed lasl
night for good and the only thing to
he done now Is to get out the vote.
Reward Holds Good
The dishonest voters are sure to be
en the Job Tuesday, but plans have
been carefully laid to prevent the
fraudulent methods that hue pre
vailed In past elections here, and the
offer of the Republican campaign
committee of $250 to anyone furnlsh
i Ing evidence nf illr e.-il voting or In
terfering" with the election will hold
good until after the election.
Although victory (.cents certain the
men wotkini? for the Republican
ticket will not null. Hather they lire
putting forth a more determined ef
fort than ever to the end that for
once in the history of Tulsa a fair
i lection may be held.
The report of the auditing firm that
has been going over the hooks of the
various city departments has proved
so nauseating that scores of Demo
crats have decided to Join In the
movement to bring about a change
In the management of the city's af
fairs, and it will b an absolutely
non-partisan vole that will elect the
strn'gbt Republican ticket Tuesday.

WHY TULSA SHOULD HAVE A
TIIK present city campaign, which
will come to an end with the
close of the polls Tuesday night, has
been one of the quietest, yet the most
intensely Interesting, that the city has
ever had. It is in striking contrast
to the campaign two years ago, and
whatever the outcome, It is a mutter
lor general and universal congratu
lation that we have escaped the vitu
perative, mud-slinging personalities
that characterized the contest for city
offices at that time. While It Is a
cjean-cut fight between Republican
and Democratic tickets, partisan poli
tics in reality la not the issue. In
municipal politics parties ore being
gradually eliminated all over the
country, nl the greater problems of
a business-like management of the

bis intention. As fur as the Mexicans
were concerned tho bandit promised
safety to all who did not take up arms
against bi:n. No quarter was shown
to the Currunzistu troops who at

According to tho refugees, General

to throw dirt In the eyes of the peo

makes away with the plunder and
carries the election on false Issues.
Yet underneath we know, as does
everyone else, that this Issue Is used
more or less efffectually to cloud and
befog the real Issues. It depends al
together upon the viewpoint of the
voter which side of the question Is
presented. So far as the Republicans

TIIK Germans are Kiaduully clos

from two directions they have se
cured a footing in the village of Vuux.
Their succesful attempt to pene

was checked by the French curiam uf
fire and the Infantry, and there was
spirited fighting nt close iiiarters be
fore the crown prince's forces finally
succeeded in pressing part way into
the village.
The German infantry has not
moved from its trenches west of the
Alcuse since the capture of Malan
court, followed shortly by the unsuc
cessful drive at the French positions
northeast of Hill No. 2!'f in the re
gion of Dead Man's hill. The artil

Mebincourt region and further at

their drive on the French left flank
are considered probable to occur
without much delay.

Four French machines fell victims

WASHINGTON. April 1. Al
though no word came through
today from General Pershing's expe
intionary force In Mexico, there wa-
a growing confidence here that tho
expedition was rapidly nearing if it
had not already reached its climax.
Three days have passed since Colonel
Dodil's cavalry dash at Guerrero stut
tered Villa's main command and estab
lished definitely the presence In Hint
totality of Villa himself and army of
ficers arc certain the American
liooper did not allow the trail to
glow ro lid.
The tiope for early capture of tho
bandit chief was increased tonight by
a rumor reaching General Gavlra,
Carranza rniumunder nt Juarez, that
Dodd's Hying column had laken the
fugitive. The war department hud
no information to conttrm Hie report.
Officials pointed out, however, that
General Gavlra hnd news of the Guer
rero fight hours before General Per
shing's account leached General Fun
ston. The Carrunzu authorities have
control of the telegraph lines and with
Carranza troops operating near Oner
rero, have facilities for prompt re
ports on the American operations.
Maintain Night Wal. li.
A night watch was maintained to
night at the war department in tho
hope that further dispatches from
Pershing would be received.
Initiation of tho agreement by
which the American troops would
have temporary use of the Mexican
Northwestern railway pending ratifi
cation of a more comprehensive proto
col apparently has been halted
through failure of the Carranza au
thorities at Juarez to receive instruc
tions regarding it. Statu and war de
partment officials reiterated tonight
their intention to await results of a
fair trial of the tentative arrange
ment before pressing Carranza for
further concessions to effect shipment
of supplies.
The possibility that Hie American
troops may contract typhus fever
which Is epidemic upon the Grand
plateau of Mexico, caused the war de
partment to issue a special bulletin
today warning the troops to guard
against iul'ectioti.
At San Antonio.
SAN ANTONIO, April 1. Absence
of news from the district about Uuer
period did not diminish the belief at
General Funston's headquarters that
General Pershing was driving the
scattered and defeated bands of Villa's
force from the hills and Hails In that
part of Chihuahua and that possibly
Villa himself had been captured, lliief
messages told of the continuation of
the chase by Colonel Dodd's cavalry
that ho effectually whipped five hun
dred Mexicans at Guerrero Wednes
day, and supporting forces that Gen
eral Pershing had sent forward, but
the results of tho operations of Thurs

A later report from General Persh
