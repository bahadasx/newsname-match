tiesburg, auditor, Mrs. A. F, Church,
Laurel. The selection of a place for
holding the next meeting was dele
gated to th,-." executive re remittee,
The meeting was one of die most
delightful as well as one of the
most successful ever held, and many
famous women were in attendance,
prominent among the number hav
ing been Mrs. Frederic Schoff of
Philadelphia and Mrs. E. T. Thatch
er, president and treasurer respec
tively, of the national organization,
and Mrs. James P. Mumford, a
member of the editorial board of
the Child Welfare magazine.
The initial session of, the conven
tion was held in the' college' chapel
at 10 o'clock Friday morning, hav
ing been opened with an instrument
al selection by Misses Gurry and
Wright, students of the music de
partment of the institution, after
which Gods blessing upon the assem
blage was invoked by Dr. J. L. Vip
perman, pastor of the First Baptist
church. The delegates were then for
mally welcomed to the city, Prof.
It. L. Whitfield, president of Ihe
college, and Prof. W. V. Frierson,
superintendent of public schools,
having delivered formal adresses,
while Mrs. J.. M. Kaufman, president
of the Parent-Teachers' Association
at the college, and Mrs. E. P. Wil
kinson and Mrs. A. T. Sale extended
greetings on behalf of similar or
ganizations at Franklin Academy
and the Barrow Memorial School.
Then followed a vocal solo by Miss
Zaida Musselwhite, after which re
sponse to the addresses of welcome
was made by Mrs. J. Benjamin
Lawrence, of Jackson, the state
president. At the conclusion of Mrs.
Lawrence's address there was a
short talk by Mrs. Edward McGehee
of Como, president of the State Fed
eration of Women's Clubs. Reports
of officers and delegates followed
Mrs. McGehee's address, and a
round table discussion, conducted
by Mrs. Sue Stewart Brame, brought
the session to an official close. .
A vocal solo by Mrs. Martin Flood
opened the afternoon session on Fri
day, and after a short period de
voted to the discussion of routine
business there was an address by
Mrs. Thatcher, of Washington, D.
C. A round table discussion led by
Mrs. Frederic Schoff, of Philadel
phia, president of the national or
ganization, followed Mrs. Thatcher's
address, and at its conclusion the
delegates adjourned to the Mabel
Ward practice home, where they at
tended a reception given in, their
honor by the local parent-teachers'
associations.
, Talks by Mrs. Schoff and Mrs.
Thatcher featured Friday night's
program, and Mrs. Schoff, who was
the first speaker introduced, deliv
ered an address which in erudition,
diction and heart interest compares
favorably with any ver heard in
Columbus. She is a most magnetic
as well as a most intelligent woman,
and the enthusiasm which she evinc
ed soon communicated itself to the
audience, whtrh wm mot rtx

nimfw, Mr. ikhofT ve a surrlnet
hitory of the rirni.tln nvrr
whirh she preld, which, by the
way, had its Inreptbn in the brain
if a southern woman, Mrs. Theo
dore Ilimey, of Georgia. The sneak-
1 1 r that she had been drawn into
Ihe work by having had brought to
her notice the case of a little girl
who was sentenced to the peniten
tiary for having stolen an article of
trifling value. Her heart revolted
at the idea of seeing this tiny tot
go to the prison, where she would he
thrown into daily contact with har
dened criminals. Upon investigaiton,
however, she found that there was
no other place to which the girl
could be sent, and she immediately
became interested in child welfare
and in the work of the Mothers'
Congress, which now has branch or
ganizations in a great majority of
the states throughout the Union,
and which has induced legislative
bodies in most of these states to es
tablish reformatories and houses of
correction for delinquent adoles
cents. Mrs. Schoff made an earnest
appeal to mothers to bestow more
thought and care upon the training
of their children. She said that of
all the influences which make or
mar the character of a child that of
the home is far the most potent and
principles instilled in them at their
mothers' knees remain with them
throughout their lives.
Mrs. Thatcher, who followed Mrs. '
Schoff spoke only a few minutes,
but she talked long enough to con-,
vince the audience that patriotism
is a strong factor in her nature and
that her love for her country is al-
-
most, if not quite, as strong as her
love for the children. The college
chapel was decorated with a large
number of American flags, and Mrs.
Thatcher said she was glad to note
thi.- display of patriotism on" the
part of Columbians, as in many
places, recently visited she had been ,
disappomted when the star-spangled

held. Mrs. Thatcher is possessed of
a commanding stage presence and a
great deal of dramatic power, and
her address, though exceedingly
snort, made a splendid impression
i:roi all who heard it.

attended an entertainment which '
was given by the students of the

Tomorrow is (he last day upon
which aspirants for office in the

and in order to have their names
placed upon the official ballots can
didates must pay their 'assessments
to lion. W. B. Harris, secretary of
the Municipal llemocratio Executive
Committee, on that date.
The law provides that all candi
dates, must qualify two weeks prior
to the date of the eloctkirt ut, wi ich
they are to go before the people,
and a the impending contest is to
take place a fortnight from next
Tuesday tomorrow is the last day
I'pon which entrance into the race
can be legally made.
It is practically certain that a
second primary will lie necessary, as
in several instances notably in the
mayoralty race, there are three can
didates for a single office, a id it is
harly likely that any one candidate
will receive a majority of the votes
cast in the first election. Tbe law
provides that the second primary
shall be held within seven days from
the first contest, and this means
thtit the run-off will occur not later
than Tuesday, April 21.
Interest in the approaching elec
tion is increasing daily, and it has
been many years since a municipal
contest has elicited so much .pecu
lation and comment. Much of this
interest r.atu rally cei.ti rs in the

Hy voting to expend the sum of
$M,Oim in the improvement of
highways citizens of the First su
pcrwsor's district have demonstrat
ed their progressive ncss and willing-m-s
to join the march of progress
which citizens in other districts
throughout the county long ago took
up, an election which was held there
Thursday having resulted in a vic
tory for the proposed bond issue by
a vote of Kirt to 121.
The result of the election is of
far more than local importance, as
the issuance of the bonds means not
only the practical completion of the
good roads system of Lowndes coun
ty but the completion of th Missis
sippi route of the proposed Jackson
Memorial Highway insofar as this
county is concerned. The only por
tion of the route lying in the bor
viers of the county that .is not in
sitod sh.ipi; is a Sunt .sttttc'n u"t
roadway in the First district, and
ihe decision of the people to issue
the bonds means that this roadway
will at once be improved.
Realizing the importance of the
election, promoters of the Jackson
Memorial IIi(hway in this immed
iate section evinced a keen interest
i t its outcome. A public meeting was
hell nt Caledonia, the metropolis of
tne First district, on March 24, and
i.i eloquent language good road:
boosters urged citizens present to
vole for the bonds, having submitted
figures to show that the issuance cf
ihese would result in only a very
:nmll increa.e in the rate of taxi-
'iu...
Among those who manifested dei p
and unabiding interest in the out
come of the election were Hon. B.
A Weaver, Hon. T. .1. Locke. Jr.,
aid ('apt. 1). K. Stephenson, who
t win . Use the good i nail commission
of district No. 2, and its result h
le,-gely ilue to the efforts on their
part. Mr. Weaver ni d Mr. Locke at
tended the boosters' meeting whicn
'iis held at Caledonia, anil persoa
ii'ly urged citizen to vote for ti e
( n while the commission offic
iary agreed to furnish $20,0(10 to
e. aril- load improvement in the Fir.-t
lii'rict provided its citizens would
v.ite to expend double the amount
for a similar purpose.
The f 10,000 bond issue recently
provided makes a total of $373,000
that the people of Lowndes county
have voted for public highway im
provement during the past eighteen
months. Every district in the coun
ty lias voted bonds for this purpose
except the third, and as the people
of this district are live and progres
sive it is believed that they will soon
join the movement.
