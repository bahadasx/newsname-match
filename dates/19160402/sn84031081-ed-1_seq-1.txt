Kl Paso, Tex,, April l.--The story
of the murder of three Americana, il
i o ilman and an Englishman at Miu
BC8, was brought here today hyAmer-
leam arriving from Chihuahua city
and was accepted a! authentic by
federal official!,
The bandits' victims were Benja
min Snell, Dr. A. T. EJtetl, l.ee Mndcs
ley, Americans; Herman Blanken
burg, a German; Donald MeGregpr,
also known as Bruce, ;i llrltlsh lUfo
Jeet. Two other Ameileuiis, Henry
ACklin and Frank W Is, Were In
Minaea al the time, but their fate is
unknown. Tha news was brought to
Chihuahua City by J. II. I.ocke, Ihe
only American who is known lo have
escaped the massacre.
Death to "tiiingisN.-'
According to the story Villa cap
tured Minaea, Huerreio and San Isl
dro last Mondnv. Everywhere he
wept he announced bis intention of
putting to death every "gringo" that
fell into his ham's and he carried out
his intention. As fur as the Mexicans
were , oncemed the bandit promised
safety to all those who did not take
up arms against linn. No ipjarter
was shown 0 th" I'atran.istu troops
win, attempted to resist him.
The one gleam of light in the dalle
stot. i Is the probability that Villa's
i,ioo,i lust is what enabled CoWiel
Dodd to deliver his crushing blow at
s.tu Qsronltno ranch two days after
the crime ,,f Minaea, a blow that has
raised high hopes that the blood
thirsty brigand's days are now num
bered According to the refugves.
