PARIS, April 2. Kcsuming the
"nut cracker" tactics, the crown
prince, unable to advance on the
east tank of the Meuse, beyond
the village of Vaux, has shifted
his aggressive again to the west
of the river, and his heavy guns
are once more bombarding the
French positions between Malan
court and Avocourt.
The next attempt of the Ger
mans to advance is expected to
come on the lines west of the
Meuse, that seemingly being the
only sector in which the Germans
have any chance of success.
ANOTHER ATTEMPT MADE.
Between Vaux and Fort Douaumont
the French, holding strong defenslvu
positions, have prevented an, 'ur
ther advanee.
At Malancourt. too. the crown
prince's men have been unahle to
debouch from the villa ruins be
cause of the. Intensive French Are, lint
the renewal of the German bombard
ment at that point would Indicate
another attempt of the crowd prince
to break through.
The Germans gained a foothold In
the wee-tern outskirts of the vllle of
Vaux, five mile northeast of Verdun,
early yesterday after suffering heavy
losses.
The Germans came under a terrible
fire from Fort Vaux In their first el
tempt against the village along the
Vaux brook, and were slaughtered in
largo. numbori.
The second attack, prcreded by a
terrific artillery bombardment, .-'rove
the French back upon the center of
the village In a four-hour struggle.
Under Heavy Fire.
The Germans, having occupied Ma
lancourt. must shortb launch heavy
assault against DIM' .104, or relinquish
tho village they won at heavy cost of
life.
French batteries around Pesd Man
Hill and on Hill 304 have laid Mnlan
court under terrific fire nlglu and
day since It fell Into German hands.
The Germans must either advance or
retire from the position.
In the Woevre. and also In he Ar
gonne. minor artillery fights con
tinued, the French directing heavy

Federation that he will come to this
city some time after January ' '9l- 'f
Washington wishes to make a date that
far ahead.
The evangelist declined to make 'any

quest for a Washington campaign In ad
vance of his meeting with a committee
tomorrow at Foundry M. K. Church,

pects to gie to Washington tomorrow.
t'p to vestcrda morning Mr Sunday
had not iirrlved nt a decision. In fact he
had given the matter of Washington
campaign little consideration.
Recalled by Mrn. Sunday.
The matter was called In his attention
by Mrs. Sunday, "while he was talking
about plans for his visit here tomorrow.
"Pa, )ou know they're going to ask
you about going to Washington." she
said, "and ou'vo got to have an answer

NEW YORK, April 2. -Out of a psychic shadowland, whose
boundaries, scientists admit, arc of prcplcxing uncertainty, has come
"The Little Bad Man From Egypt.''
His malign influence is heaping complication upon complication
in the weirdest wholesale crime of a decade.
H"s mundane familiar is Dr. Arthur Warren Waite, tennis
champion, clubman, surgeon-dentist and confessed slayer.
To him by his alter ego, the doctor is now attributed the
moral responsibility for the deaths of at least two people. Yet in
and out of the story of the crime, "The Little Bad Man From Egypt''
moves so adroitly, that the city's prosaic man-hunters even with the
aid' of psychologists have nut be mi able to determine just what his
place may be in the web anfi woof of killing which has onn'cshcd
Dr. Waite.
Is "The Little Bad Man From Egypt" simply the figment of a
drug-disordered imagination, pavfng the way for an insanity defense?
Or is he an incontrovertible manifestation that Dr. Waitc's

SAN ANTONIO, April 2.
Ploughing through snow np to the
knees of their tired horses, four
picked squadrons of cavalry are
relentlessly dosing- rn on Poncho
Villa, according- to the last nrfar
matron received from the scene of
action.
A thonsand American cavalry
men are drawing a ring: about what
is reliahly reported to be the hid
ing place , of the bandit leader
rrortheasj.-oJiJCuerrero,. and army
leaders momentarily are expect
ing a "flash" that he has been
captured.
While no confirmation of the
reports from Chihuahua City that
Villa had been captured at Mtnaca
have been received, army men
point out the possibility that news
might be withheld by Pershing un
til the widely scattered United
States forces have been reunited
for the return march to the
border.
RUMORS DISCREDITED.
Scores of wild rumors are afloat along
th brrder. In these reports Villa Is
reported variously as being badly wound
ed, with his leg amputated, ns being
headed for Chihuahua Cltv with a pick
ed band to capture the city and murdf
the foreigners, and as being far from
the scene of operation;".
Basing their opinions on the official
reports from Pershing thai Villa was
wounded, srmy officers give no credencn
to anv of the reports except tho one
Ihat the bandit leader Is being hemmed
in and already may have been taken
A meshsgn dated San Oeionlmo ranch,
received by General Fiinston cnry to
day, stated that Villa undnubteil was
in ihe country northeast of Ouerrero
that American troops surround the re
