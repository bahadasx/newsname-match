FAVORABLE TO BRANDEIS
Sub-Committee of Senate Committee
Favorable to Him.
Washington, April 1. By a three-to-two
vote, the senate judiciary com
mittee investigating the nomination
of Louis D. Brandeis to the supreme
court bench, decided today to recom
mend hia confirmation to the entire
committee. It Is understood the
whole committee stands practically
even.
The democratic county convention
which assembled Saturday afternoon
at two o'clock at the county court
house, was called to order by County
Chairman S. A. Apple, and Dr. J. W.
Burns, pastor of the First Christian
church, invoked divine blessings. The
assembling was peaceful, the prayer
was fervent and quieting, but within
one brief moment thereafter the
storm broke and there was no peace
until the Lafayette delegates were in
the ascendency and Colonel G. W.
Young was in the chair as temporary
chairman.
The fight began when Errett Dun
lay read to the convention the recom
mendation that J. C. Thompson be
elected temporary chairman. H. IT.
Brown immediately took the floor and
said that the delegates who had come
through the rain and mud were ca
pable of selecting their own chairman
without dictation from the county cen
tral committee.
Irof. Robert Michael of Provence
called the system gag rule, and op
posed to democracy, and he had never
before seen such proceedings.
R. T. Rick; ts of Fox who said for
fifty years he had been attending
democratic conventions, was bitterly
opposed to the recommendations as
being undemocratic and unfair, and
savoring of gag rule.
James A. Cotner defended the rec
ommendation as being democratic.
R. V. McManus spoke against the
recommendation.
J. C. Thompson stated to the con
vention that he had been selected
without his solicitation, but that the
rule was good democracy, and that
no attempt was being made to take
advantage of anyone.
Ex-Governor Cruce told the conven
tion if anyone would show him one
county that had ever followed the rule
he would take his seat and still his
protest. He said that such proceed
ing was unheard of in democratic
politics.
Dr. Taylor defended the recommen
dation, nnd was very plain in his re
marks in defending the county com
mittee from the charge that its meet
ing was held behind closed doors.
Jimmie Mathers took the side
against the recommendation of the
committee, and his wit kept the con
vention in an uproar of laughter as
man after man from the floor fired
questions at him while he was speak
ing. Get Down to Business.
Senator Tucker was of the opinion
that the Carter county convention
held two years ago was organized in
the same way, and he moved that
as a substitute for all pending mo
tions that the convention proceed to
elect a temporary chairman. When
the motion prevailed, the senator pre
sented the name of J. t'. Thompson,
in a very strong appeal. Lee Cruce
immediately took the floor, and with
equal eloquence nominated G. W.
Young.
Nominations were closed. Chair
man Apple ruled that no proxies could
be voted, that only those who were
present could vote. This narrowed j
the vote down because many of the
west side delegates could not get
here on account of the washout3.
The results were somewhat indefi
nite, but it was very clear that Mr.
Young was elected temporary presid
ing officer. The vote was about 41
for Thompson and TO for Young. The
election of Mr. Young was then made
unanimous and he was introduced by
his opponent, J. C. Thompson, who
was appointed to conduct him to the
desk.

FORTY-EIGHT COUNTIES
Wade Has Lead in Instructed Votes
Delegates Not Tied Will Control.
Oklahoma City, April 1. 1'p to nine
o'clock tonight, 4S counties have re
ported results of Saturday's conven
tions. In these counties, Lafayette
has 13fi instructed votes, Wade has
217, and there are 470 uninstructed
votes. It now looks like Wade may
have a majority of the instructed
votes, but it is certain that neither
man will go to the convention with
enough delegates to elect him, and
the uninstructed delegates will con
trol the convention. In each of these
counties where uninstructed delega
tions are sent, the home men have
a candidate for delegate, or for some
other honor, and the success of La
fayette or Wade may depend upon
the ability of their friends to trade
support with the uninstructed delega
tions. At any rate, from now until
the state convention is held on April
11, the game of politics will be played
in Oklahoma.
LAFAYETTE HEADQUARTERS
Looks Like the Balance of the State
Against Oklahoma County
(CONTINUED ON PAGE FOUR)
The Ardmoreite talked last night
with LaFayelte headquarters and
made an effort to talk to Wade head
quarters, but if he lias any, we could
not find them. Lafayette headquar
ters reported that Oklahoma county
went 70 strong for Wade. That very
high-handed measures were used to
keep delegations out of the convention
and that boasts were being made that
"as goes Oklahoma County, so goes
the state." It looks, said headquarters
like LaFayette has won the field, and
it also looks like the field against Ok
lahoma county.
Following are the counties and the
result as far as LaFayette headquar
ters knew at 9 o'clock last night:
Oklahoma, 70 for Wade.
Mays, 14, uninstructed.
Murray, 10, uninstructed.
Noble, 12, uninstructed. unit 'rule,
majority for LaFayette.
Pittsburg, 2S. uninstructed.
Pontotoc, 18, for LaFayette.
Seminole, 12, uninstructed.
Tillman. 13, for Wade.
Caddo, 25, uninstructed.
Canadian, 20. for Lafayette.
Carter. 19, for LaFayette.
Mcintosh, 13. for I-aFayette.
Wagoner, 9, for Lafayette.
Garvin. 21. uninstructed.
Kay, 24, unit ru!e, majority for La
Fayette. LeFlore, 20 for IaFayette.
Lincoln, 21, for LaFayette.
McClain, 13, uninstructed;
Wade and 5 for LaFayette.

Germans Holding Malancourt
Iondon, April 1. Having captured
the village of Malancourt, the Ger
mans have now shifted their offensive
eastward to the sector around the
famous Le Morte Qloinme. With heavy
forces the Teutons have attacked the
French line between Hill 293 and Le
Morte Homme and succeeded in en
tering French first line trenches. A
vigorous counter attack by the French
however, almost immediately expelled,
the Invaders and another attack by
the Teutons delivered a little later, is
declared by Paris to have been put
down completely.
The Germans have made no attempt
to debouch from Malancourt since the
occupation of that village. The heavy

west of Verdun have greatly slacken
