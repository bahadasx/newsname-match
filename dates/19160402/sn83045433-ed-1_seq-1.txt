Berlin (via London), April 1.-The Rus
sian offensive against Field Marshal von
Hindenburg's army on the nnrthern part
of the eastern front, has collapsed ac
cording to the official statement issued
by the German war office today.
In this 'offensive, which began on March
13, and continued until March 50, the
statement says, the Russian losses are
"caretlly calculated" at 140.000 men out
of )Ae 500,000 engaged. although thIs
half a Maillion men was supported by an
"'mnrecedented amount of munitions."
The Russians gained no success by the
offensive. as to the purpose of which the
war office presents an order which it
says was issued to the Russian army in
this sector on March 17. In this order
"the ejection of the enemy from the
frontiers of the kingdom" appears as
the purpose of the offensive.
London, April 1-Swinging back across
the Meuse in his pendulum-like drive on
Verdne. the crown prince, by a mighty
night attack on the Vaux-lHaudremont
front, smashed forward into the village
of Vaux.
New attacks launched today against the
ravine connecting the- ruined fort of
Douaumount anb Vaux were repulsed, ac
cording to the midnight statement from
Paris. West of the Meuse. where by a
previous blow of the pendulum, the
Crown Prince won Malancourt. the day
passed quietly, the Germans contenting
themselves with consolidating the ground
gained.
Asmwu Itoops entered Vaux after a
dagerate battle, lin which. despite im
mensely superior numbers, they had been
repulsed several times.
Their first attack broke down com
pletely under the French machine gun
and barrage fire. The second, In which
hand-to-hand fighting was developed, last
ed several hours before the first German
set foot in the outskirts of the village.
A great part of the ruined hamlet still
Temains in the hands of the French.
One Raiding Zeppelin Wrecked.
One of the fle German Zeppelins whichI
conducted a three-pronged raid on Lon
don's suburbs and the eastern and north
eastern counties last night. was de
stroyed by the British gunfire. At least
one of the others is believed to have been
hit. Twenty-eight persons were killed
and forty-four injured by bombs dropped
from the raiding dirigibles.
So far it has been impossible to com
pute the property damage, telegraph lines
being put out of commission in many
places by a storm. The raid lasted five
hours. the Zeppelins flying over many
towns without even attempting to drop
bombs.
The wrecked Zeppelin was the 1-15. It
was struck In the stern by a shell and
immediately fell to a lower level. Slowly
It continued to descend until it fell into
the Thames Estuary. The crew was cap
tured and taken to Chatham.
That another of the raiders may have
met a similar fate is indicated by the
story brought back today by a pilot, who
had taken a steamer to sea. le says
he saw a Zeppelin, its back broken, at
sea. It was more than 7M feet long.
Were Superdiriaibles.
All five of the raiders were of a new
type, which has but recently taken to
the air. They were super-dirigibles,
much larger than the Zeppelins which
made earlier raids on England. That
one of these Dreadnoughts of the air
should be brought down by British fire
for the first time in the war caused great
satlisfaction here.
Reports so far received make it cer
tain that at least seventy-four bombs
were dropped by the air invaders. Some
fell in the suburbs of London.

By DAMON. RLUNYON.
(Special Corresepodes d the Internationsi xes

With U. S. Army Headquarters in the
Field in Mexico. March 30 (via Courier to
Columbus, N. Mex.)-According to many
Mexicans most of the comparatively
few men with Francisco Villa are serving
him against their wishes.
It is said Villa Impressed many of his
followers. forcng them to accompany
him on the raid into Columbus and sioM
inder penalty of death.

"Vill& msad. melr and boys go with him
it the poiut of the pistol when he came
ip this way fast time," said an old rest
ient yesterday. "They didn't wa.nt to
o. They ar sick of war. But they
were afraid to ait. It was conscription
n a violent form.
"What was true of the people along
ils last linc of march is probably true of
he people everywhere else throughout
:he republic. Villa may be able to add
L few to his following by the same meth
yds, but I do not believe he will raise
my considerable army as has been re
3orted."
The reports that trickle In from the
'ar-flung American front do not Indicate
:he Villa is adding to his crew. In his
light down along the Casas Grandes val
ey he was seen by many persons and,
vhile their estimates of the number of
sis men vary, it seems to be agreed that
le didn't have over 300.
Soldiers Win Many Friends.
Wherever American soldiers have moved
n Mexico they have left a very favor
Lble impression. They are going to re
nove any hostility that may have existed
n the minds of the country people of the
-epublic against the Americans if pos
iible.
The American </artermasters are buy
ng hay and grain in large quantities and
payIng well for it. The soldiers purchase
!ggs, chickens. preserves, milk and ev
trything else of an edible nature that
hey can find.
American tobacco is becoming scarce,
yut the men buy the native Mexican
roduct, which they call "doble tobacco,"
and It answers the purpose very well.

New York, April I.-Ernest Schiller.
the lone German pirate who captured the

held it for a night, was locked up in
New York police headquarters tonight.
He will be arraigned tomorrow morning
in Jefferson Market police court, charied
with having, in concert with others not

on board the Cunard steamship Pan

North River on March 3.
When Schiller is arraigned he will be
held for examination later. The police
can hold hiri in this way for forty-eight
hours, while they decide to whom he be
longs. The New York Federal authori
ties do not want Schiller.
They say that they have enough cases
of German plotters to deal with, and
think that if Schiller's offense is a mat
ter of Federal juitadiction he should be
sent back to Delaware. for the United
States authorities there to proceed
against. The Federal authorities and

Chicago, April 1.-The farmers around
Chicago made good their threats today
to dump milk into the ditches rather than
see it go to the dealers who have refused

with eggs and other missiles, ready to
prevent the delivery of any milk by'
seceding farmers.
The Borden plant, at Huntley. was
indefinitely closed. In Marengo a crowd
of farmers dumped in the gutters ten
cans of milk from the wagon of a farmer
who was on his way to the plant. The

ceives milk from forty dairies, received
a supply from only nine, and the Algon

INEVITABLE
"NOT GUILTY"
SAYS BERLIN
Germany Formally Denies Re
sponsibility for Explosion
on Liner Sussex.
Delay Expected in Getting German
Side of Attacks on Other
Two Vessels.
The State Department yesterday made
public the purport of the reply which
the German foreign oflce has made to
Ambassador Gerard's request for infor
mation concerning the explosion on the
Channel liner Sussex. The reply is to
the effect that the German government
knows nothing about the cause of the
explosion. No submarine commander
has reported'having attacked the Sus
sex.
The only information whith German
foreign offIce ofmcialu claim to have con
cernIng this case or the cases of the al
leged attacks on the Englishman and
the Manchester Engineer, where Ameri
can lives were placed In jeopardy, comes
from reports in the German press.
In making Its position clear to Am
Dassador Gerard, the German foreign of
flce has, of course, explained that should
any submarine commander report on any
of the cases mentioned. the facts con
tained In the report will be communi
cated to the United States government.
Offcials of the State Department here
anticipate considerable delay before get
ting the German side of the alleged
attacks on the Englishman and the Man
chester Engineer.
No surprise is manifested here over
the fact that Germany denies responsi
bility in 'the Sussex case, as it has. been
known for several days that Germapy
claims that a German submarIne could
not have been responsible,
