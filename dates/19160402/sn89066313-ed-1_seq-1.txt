KANSAS TRACK TEAM
MA! DEFEAT TIGERS
Present Jayhawker Prospects
Best in Years, Thinks
H. F. Schulte.
SIMPSON RELIED ON
Missouri Hopes to Make
Good Showing in Western
Conference Meet.
"Kansas is coming," sas II. F.
Schulte. And the "Indian" does not
speak merel of the arrival of the
Ja hawker track team on Ma.v U for
the annual outdoor tangle with the
Tigers. Schulte means that the Kan-
sans have the best track prospects
they have ever had. He sajs: "Kan
sas has the men, right now, to win the
Valley championship hands down.
And the distressing part of it is, they
are on the ascent. Thev are coming.
If the.v don't get us this jear, they
will next."
And of Missouri, Schulte sajs noth
ing, which characteristic of him. It
is up to the rooters to make their own
observations and calculations, and,
in view of the indoor season just clos
ed, a fairl accurate line ma be had
on the coming contests. Missouri is
fortunate this ear m having several
versatile men whom Schulte may use
as the particular occasion demands.
Pittam is the most promising addition
to this v tar's team from last ear's
freshman squad. He is an excellent
dash man, quarter-miler and high and
broad jumper.
Simpson Itetter riian Ever.
It is obvious, first of all, that Bob
Simpson is far better than last ear.
In the K. C. A C. meet, he turned the
tables on Jo Loonns, winning the o0-
ard low hurdles in the world's rec
ord time of o 4-o seconds Schulte ex
pects a new world's record from Bob
n the high sticks outdoors. Bob's
specialties are the 100-and 2L'0-ard
dashes, high and low hurdles and the
broad jump In outdoor trials a few
das ago, over a half-flight of low
hurdles. Bob made the 110 ards in
11 !-" seconds, which, at the same
rate is JJ J-5 seconds for the lull dis
tance, just tiemg the world's record.
Itenick will probabl be used in the
high hurdles and sprints. Daggy, :n
the low Hurdles and quarter.
Wvatt and Dagg, in the Kansas-
....ssuuw ...uuu. ii.ee., ...u a uC.m .i;of the Tubantia, comment reservedly.
m the 4 40, making a new- tracK record
cf oZ 2-1 seconds. The old record of
"i2 !-," seconds, mad b Shannon
Douglass, had stood for eight ears.
These two, with Pittam, make the
quarter look like a strong Tiger
event. And there is Niedorp, last
ear's Valle champion, who is appar
ently rounding into his old-time form.
Helaj eeds Another Man.
The relay team, at present, needs
another man badly. The coaches hope
that Niedorp will be able to resume
his old place The Tigers have at
least three more opportunities to
avenge their defeat at the hands of
the Kansas relay team in St. Louis.
The first chance comes at the Drake
Relay at Des Moines April 22; then
the dual meet at Columbia May 13;
again in the Conference meet May 27
and 2S.
Missouri is weak in the distance
runs, from the half-mile up, as the in
door meets have shown. Rider, Ga
belman, Corvvin, Smon and Fowler
are the best of the Tiger material in
these events, and it is to be hoped
that they will develop into consistent
point winners before the close of the
season.
That this spring is the logical sea
son for the Tigers to make their
strongest bid for the Western Con
ference championship is the opinion
of Tiger track enthusiasts in Kansas
City and St. Louis. Even Mr. Schulte
admits that it would give him keen
pleasure to be able to take high hon
ors in the big meet, but he adds that
the atmosphere must clear consider
ably between now and June 3.

ciety of the Broadway Methodist

The resolutions on the hazing ques
tion follow :
"Whereas, we, the student boilv of

less of its character in the past, has
nothing constructive or desirable to
contribute to student life, and
"Whereas, we believe that hazing
interferes with the best interests of
the Student Bod ; and
"Whereas, we believe that gross
exaggerated reports of hazing, circu
lated over the state, have injured the
Universitv of Missouri:
"Therefore, be it resolved b us, the
student body of the University of Mis
souri, in mass meeting assembled,
that:
"All forms of hazing and chi-chi-ui;
be henceforth abolished and pro
