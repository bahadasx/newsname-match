An Editorial Dedicated
to Advent of Fall
BY THE EDITOR.
This is an editorial, but not mine.
You may have read of the death in Baltimore of
Tody Hamilton, world- greatest press agent—the
man who invented the cirrus-poster adjective.
Years ago, in JJarmun's hey-day, someone asked
Tody, "Why do you exaggerate?"
"I don't exaggerate," said Tody. "I just get en
thusiastic."
And then lie told this story, which we'll call Tody
Hamilton's editorial:
• # #
There were two fish-dealers on opposite sides of
the street.
One of them put up this sign:
Fresh Codfish—loc Pound.
The other one took a look, and tacked up this:

you suppose would shove it ahead the faster?
With September here, presaging a busy fall and
winter season, why shouldn't Taooma apply Tody's
lesson. It's ane plus ultra town. Let's make it still
more ultra.

LITTLE INFALLIBILITY
IN CHAPMAN'S SYSTEM
(Editor's note: The following
is the first of a series of articles
which will appear in The Times
giving good natured sketches of
the characters and records ot
some of the leading candidates for
Pierce county superior court
judge. The office of judge is per
haps the most important which
the county has to offer. You will
w.uil to be acquainted with the
candidates when you go to the
polls to cast your vote.)
By Edgar C. Wheeler
There are a few wearers of the
honorable black robe in the coun
try who do not believe In the in
fallability of the honorable court,'
or at least, don't try to make oth
er people believe In it.
Judge Chapman of the Pierce
county superior benah, candidate
for re-election. Is one of them.
To prove it he smokes a corn
cob pipe and strong tobacco.
Also, he doesn't shut .lis door
when he passes into his inner
sanctum. You can go in if you
want to and say: "How d'ye do,
judge," just like that. And he'll
say, "Have a seat."
Judge Chapman Is a funny sort
of a judge. He spends most all
his time judging. If he's not on
the bench hearing a case, you'll
generally find him in his office or
at his home, studying It over and
deciding who's right and who's*
wrong.
But he Isn't a grind, for all
that. It's his idea that getting
out and pumping fresh air into
your system clears the head for
action. 80 he walks a lot and
plays golf a little.
He's a dub at golf. He knows
better how to rule on a demurrer
than get out of a bunker In two.
The judge claims he hasn't any
babbies.
I'.ui nothing nlll linger when pence is made!"
Giddap! Giddap! Gid-a-rap, rap, rap!"
"Cinder* are hot and (he seas are .suit;
Kvrry hit of it's Wilson's fault,
And the nay lie rules ns is made for mules;
His foreign ambassadors all are fools!"
Giddap! Giddap! Gid-a-rap, rap, rap!"
Listen now, (hit rile and hold your chin:
Tills sort of stuff lets yon out, not In!
The tune of the hammer is filled with pain,
And we don't like the clamor of this refrain:
Giddap! Giddap! Gid-a-rap, rap. rap!"
"All my Urn« goes to my work
on the bench," says he, "and 1
find there's plenty of it to keep
me busy."
Also, he offers the bold state
ment that being a judge is a busi
ness man's business; it isn't hold
ing di>.\ n a soft place on a ma
hogany bench.
It so happens that most of the
cases dished out to Judge Chap
man's lceurt are the kind where
one peVson has some kale that
doesn't; belong to him, and the
other person claims he hasn't.
Sometimes its only a hundred or
so, and other times its a thousand
or so.
Right here crops out another
peculiarity about Judge Chapman.
Ha'a got the idea that the little
casaa, willi only a hundred or so
of cash involved, need more care
ful attention than those where
the big wads are at stake.

liquors has been forbidden la
Rumania under severe penalties.
He works on that theory.
The smallest squabble is his
biggest business.
"If 1 should make a mistake
with the big ones there is always
another chance in the higher
courts," is the way he puts it.
"But the little fellows all de
pend on me. If 1 should make an
error, the wron,? and injustice
would he done, and there would
be no remedy."
Most everybody knows Judge
Chapman.
They ought to; he's been on
the Pierce county bench 16 years.
His record has been clean.
Chapman's hair has grown
gray on the bench. But even at
that he still insists that his court
isn't infallible."
"If anybody thinks I don't do
things right, or if anybody has a
way for doing things better, I
want to know about It. That's
what I'm here for," says he.

II SUSPECTED
Police are following two
dues in the mysterious mur
dering of T. W. Bethel, .17,
former negro janitor in the
Perkins building, whose bul
let-riddled body was found
shortly after .V.'in t i idm
morning lying on the first
floor of the building in which
lie iis.il to work.
A description of four men seen
running from the building short
ly after the fatal shooting has led
police officials to believe that
striking longshoremen were re
sponsible.
Itctli:l had been employed re
cently as a strike-breaker at the
Milwaukee dock.
Another clue, however, lias
come from the fact that Bethel
whs recently acquitted in the su
perior court on a charge, of hav
ing had Indecent relations with a
young negro girl living in the
South Bad. At the time of the
trial, it was discovored there were
two distinct negro elements in the
city, highly opposed to each
oilier.
I Since the acciuittal, several
prominent negroes of the side op
posing Itcthei have appeared ln
fore Deputy I'rosecutor -Seidell
and have told him-that the result
of the trial was unjust. Bethel
was a deacon in the African
Methodist church.
Have Descriptions.
A hat, with patches of short
hair attached to it, and a belt
buckle picked up on the scene of
the murder are in the possession
of Coroner Stewart.
These, with a minute descrip
tion of at leats two of Bethel's
assailants furnished 1 y O. K. Mud
son, a hoy employed in the mail
ing room of the Perkins Press,
furnish the evidence with which
the police expect to capture the
murderer.
According to the story told to
the police, Hudson was walking
from the mailing room in the rear
of the building at 5:30 Friday
morning when he saw Bethel and
a white man In a controversy at
the corner of 11th and A.
Starts For Kntranee.
"Don't threaten me," he heard
Bethal say several times.
Bethel then started townrd the
entrance of the Perkins building.
The man followed, and was
joined by four others who came
from across the street. When
Bethel had reached the front en
trance of the building, he brand
ished a stout cane he was carry
ing and cried:
"Don't you follow me."
Seeks Protection.
Bethel, up to 1912, had worked
as janitor in the building and evi
dently was seeking protection in
side. As he disappeared through
the doorway four men gave chase.
Hudson says the last he saw
of Bethel he was going up the
short stairs that lead to the first
floor proper.
A minute later he heard a shot
and a scream, then two more
shots. He ran to 11th and Pa
cific to notify the police. When
he returned he saw the four men
run out of the building.
Two of them dashed down A
street to 12th. Turning down
12th, they ran down an alley at
Tebbett's store and disappeared
down a spur of the railroad
tracks.

the murder.
"When non-union men begin to
