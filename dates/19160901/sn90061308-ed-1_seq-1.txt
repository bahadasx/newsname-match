EN JOINS A RAIL UNION
Nebraska Judge Issues Restraining
Order at Employees' Request
Omaha, Aug. SO. Judge Willis E.
Sears of the district court of Douglas
county today issued an order restrain
ing the general and local officials of
the Order of Railway Conductors call
ing or enforcing a strike on the lines
of the Union Pacific.
The order was issued on petition of
Edwin A. Hamilton, a conductor of
the Union Pacific and a member of the
Order of Railway Conductors, who
says that he and many other employ
ees of the road are anxious to contin
ue at work .
As reasons for asking the order
Hamilton in his petition said that up
to July 1 the railroads were regarded
as separate units i the brotherhoods,
but that at that time the rules were
amended and it was provided that the
, vote of .all should rule the conductors
on each road. He says this is illegal
because strike ballots were sent out
June 15 and that the conductors of the
Unioh JPacific did not cast a two-thirds
vote authorizing the strike.
Hamilton says that if the strike goes
on he will lose his pension rights if he
strikes, or if he does not strike he will
lose his rights in the brotherhood, and
so "brings the suit not only for himself
but all similarly affected.

I CONGRESS MAY EN-
ACT LAWS1 THAT
WILL PREVENT STRIKE
Would Fix Eight Hour Day and Pro
vide for Investigation of Its
Effects
Washington, Aug; SO. All the in
fluence of the . administration was
KrtiTDftif frt Vipsiv tmtflv in nn pfFnW-. fft
persuade
the railroad brotherhood
leadersto cancel or postpone the or-
a
day, while leaders -in congress began
paving the way for legislation design
ed to prevent or stop the threatened
industrial catastrophe. Little tangi
ble progress was made in either direc
tion, but nevertheless in official quar
ters tonight there still prevailed con
fidence that in one way or another the
walkout would be averted.
To the spokesmen of President Wil
son who approached them, all of the
brotherhood officials gave the same re
ply; that they had no power to recall
the strike order and that only one
could keep their men at work after 7
a. m. L&hor day. Further pressure
will he "brought to hear, and, as a last
resort, the president is considering a
public appeal to the men themselves
to have the order rescinded.
Apparently the legislation which is
being counted on to stay the "brother
hoods is that part of the president's
program which would fix an eight
hour day for railroad employes en
gaged in operating trains in interstate
commerce, and provide for an investi
gation tof its effects hy a commission
'or board. This embodies the prmci
"pal features of the president's origin
al plan, accepted by the tranmen, and
G. W. Lee, "head of the trainmen, said
tonight that its enactment with a
guarantee that the present rate of
daily pay would be regarded "by the
brotherhood leaders as a "satisJadtoory
settlement."
Immediately upon its becoming a
law, he said, the brotherhood leaders
would Bend out the code message ho-
tifying .general chairmen that the
strike orders should not go Mto . ef
fect. Even some of the congressional
leaders 'who oppose other features of
the program say such s. law coold'be
passed.
The senate virtually sidetracked the
emergency revenue bill for an all-day
debate on the crisis, while Ihe inter
state commerce committee :arraged

LETTER FROM OREGON.
The following letter from Mrs. J.
N., Guthrie, formerly of Monett, will
be of interest to the many friends oi
Mr. and Mrs. Guthrie ai tnis place:'
"Klamath Falls, Ore., Aug. 25.
Editor Times: Enclosed find money
order for subscription to the Times for,
another year. 1 don't see how we
could get along without it, iov it is
about the only way we get news from
Monett now. Mv friends there have
nearly all stopped writing. I like to
hear all about everything that hap
pens there, but I don't think I want to
. come back there to live, especially
when 1 lead about how hot and dry.it
is and how you are all suffering withj
the heat. Here it is so nice and cool.
It has never been more than 98 here
this summer, and then only for a dary
or two. The climate is surely fine,
; and the fall of the year seems almost
perfect.
"There are two lakes here con
nected by the Link river. There are
a great many fish caught here and in
the lakes and streams farther away.
"The greatest attraction in southern
Oregon is Crater lake. As its name
implies, it is a lake in the crater of
an extinct volcano. The volcano was.
once active and was destroyed by vol?
canic action. From the surface to the
bottom of the lake it is 2000 feet The
color of the water of Crater lake is
decidedly blue. Persons go there
from July 1 to September 30 to camp.
It is sixty miles from here. There
are many other delightful places to go
during the summer. Many are now
camping at the huckleberry patches
not so very far from here.
"We like it much better here than
we did in Colorado. For one thing,
the ' altitude is not so high and for
another, the winters are not so cold.
Six above zero was the coldest we had
last winter. We .have our home here
and suppose we shall spend the rest
of our lives here. Mrs. J. N. Guthrie."

15,000 NATIONAL GUARDSMEN
ARE ORDERED HOME
Two Regiments from Missouri Among
the Number That Is to Be
'"'' Returned.
Washington, Aug. 30. Orders for
the return to their state camps of
15,000 national guardsmen now on the
Mexican border were issued - tonight -by
the war department. General
Funston was directed to return three
regiments from New York, two from
New Jersey, two from Illinois, two
from Missouri, and one each from
.California, Oregon, Washington and
Louisiana.
Secretary Baker announced the or
der after a conference with President
Wilson.at the White House. Earlier
in the day the department had ordered
to their home station 6000 regular
coast artillerymen who have been
serving as infantry on the border.
The secretary's statement said:
. "In view of the fact that substan
tially this number of troops who have
not done patrol duty on the .border,
are how on their way there, it is felt
that this number can be spared. Pn
a few days, if transportation facilities
remain undisturbed, the department
intends to order home some more reg
iments, and, possibly, to replace them
with troops now in their, mobilization,
camps in the several states."
Regiments to be sent home were not
designated by number, and it is under
stood that their selection is left to
General Funston.
Department officials think there is
ample force on the border now to se
cure proper protection, and with the.,
gravity of the Mexican situation con
stantly lessening, it is not considered
necessary to-strengthen General Fun,
ston's command. The policy now is)
to give all of the state troops called?
into the federal service opportunity to
see service on war footing along the
international line. . ......
Withdrawal of General Pershing's
expedition in Mexico, which is ex
pected to follow soon after the meet
ing of the Mexican-American " joint,
commission at Portsmouth, - N. H.,
prdhabljr will lead jU th early return
home of all the guardsmen. PershfngV
troops, added to the regulars always
on the border, army officers think,
would make the patrol sufficiently
strong unless some new trouble should
develop.
FRISO PASSENGER TRAIN
NO. 5 TO STOP AT EXETER
The Public Service Commission has
given orders that Frisco passenger
train No. 5 shall stop at Exeter. This
action was taken in response to a
petition from the citizens of Cassville
and Exeter.
This train reaches Exeter at 5:57
each morning. People having busi
ness at the county seat often find it
convenient to take this train to finish
up their business in one day and its
discontinuance last April has worked
a hardship on many people of the
county.
GETTING AHEAD OF THE STRIKE
A Joplin citizen, badly under the
influence of booze, gave the following
explanation to a policeman who ar
rested him:
"Y'see, ish thish way, offisher.
thish railroad strike ish pulled
(hie) we're goin' be up 'ginst it
If
off
fer
wet goods. Sho I just fieerered out
there might be a run on the saloons
and none (hie) of the goods left. Sha
I thought I'd better git mine now."
HIRAM COOPER DEAD.

Barry county, died August 25 at his
home near Corsicana, at the age of 80
years. His wife, deceased, was a
sister of the late Dr. T. H. Jeffries.
He is survived by one son, Robert
Cooper, of Joplin, formerly of Monett.
