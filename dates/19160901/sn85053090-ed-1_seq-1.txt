The Primary Election
Another primary election has
passed and gone into history and
we hope for Montana it is the
last of its calibre. That the 1916
primary appealed to the voters
any better than that of 1914
would certainly be casting a re
flection on the progress and in
talligence of the Montana voter.
To us the whole affair is a failure,
a frost, and the sooner the law is
repealed or fired into the state
capitol furnace the better satis
fied the majority of the voters
will be. We do not know as yet
just how many of the 3823 reg
istered voters went to the polls
but we would guess tnat about
one-fifth with a little exertion
managed to show up. They vot
ed in every manner, shape and
form, some voting every ballot,
some just two and now and then
a ballot showed up looking like a
Bulgarian bill of-fare. In Eka
laka, a strong democratic center,
noarly everyone voted the G. O.
P. ticket and their reason we be
lieve was just. Some informa
tion started spreading early in
the day that Baker and the north
end were set on putting over
their man for commissioner—
which by the way in some re
spects comes above the presiden
cy in Failon County—and Eka
laka not to be double crossed in
such a fashion proceeded to put
on her fighting duds and lined up
nearly solid on voting the G. O.
P. ticket just to see that she eot
a îair deal and a county commis
sioner for the central district,
regardless of his politics. This
method of gaining our ends of
course is poor political practice,
a black eye to our sincerity to
the state ticket and may cause
some of our good G. O. P. friends
to hint that the whole bunch has
gone republican. But don't let
this little matter—a result of the
present republican primary sys
tem—startle you. The central
district of Fallon county will get
a commisioner, so will the south
ern section and and the Novem
ber election is going to cause an
awful added expense to the tax
payers for pencils to mark down
the largest democratic majority
ever recorded in the history of
this part of the country that the
early day republicans took away
from the Indians.

County Fair Progressing
— -
Everything i 3 getting along
nicely with the arrangements for
the coming Fallon County Fair
j to be held on Sept. 19 20. Super
intendent Wm. Gerner of the
agricultural department reports
a lively interest being taken in
all parts of the county for this
year's exhibit. Mr. Gerner has
been in nearly every part of the
county'boosting the fair, espec
ially the livestock and agricultur
al part and finds that much en
thusiasm prevails. In talking
with the program committee we
learn that many new sporting
events are to be added before
the opening day. It has been
decided to enter a ladies relay
race upon the program with a
good purse. There will also be a
Shetland pony race between the
ponies to be given away in the
Eagle contest. The race track
has been put in fine condition
and repairs have been made on
the fair ground buildings. While
much is yet to be done to com
plete all arrangements for the
fair all committees are busy and
everything will be in readiness
by the opening day.
Grant 's Dance Big Success
_____
j No matter whether it's a pub
I lie auction sale, a French inspec
tion. an Italian rejection or a
common horse race, whenever
Jess Grant announces that some
thing is going to be pulled off,
j the crow d begins to gather.
I While Jess is not very strong for
j the dancing game he took one
j long chance Ui i accomodating his
1 neighbors and friends last Satur
day evening with a barn dance
j at his ranch north of town, and
i the result is known to some five
I hundred people who attended.
I The lowest count made of the
autos there was 120 and several
j claimed the number at 128.
These, along with many wagons,
buggies and saddle horses, brot
a big enough crowd that outside
visitors were inclined to believe
I that a mobilization o f Fallon
j County residents had been called.
Elliott's orchestra of Ekalaka
assisted by W. Ped Akers of Wil
lard furnished the music and a
I big time was had. At midnight
a big lunch was enjoyed by ev
eryone and about daybreak the
dance ended. Jess' friends are
wondering what he is going to
do next, but it's dollars to dough
nuts that this year's fair will not
find him lacking with something
new.
Card of Thanks
We wish to thank all those who
so kindly assisted us during the
sickness and death of our little
daughter, especially those who
brought flowers.
Mr. and Mrs. Jack McPherson.
