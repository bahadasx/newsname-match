PREDICTS WILSON
LANDSLIDE
Hughes Can't Make American
Voters Think White is
Black.
Because the country has been
kept "at peace in the midst of
a Bedlam," there will be a land
slide for Wilson in November, in
the opionion of A. W. Krueger,
of New York, who expressed his
views in a letter to the editor of
the New York Globe (Rep.)
"We are at the present day,"
said Mr. Krueger, " a nation of
veritable prodigal sons of pros
perity, who will not desert us
for some 'war-baby' at the end
of the war as Herr Hughes
would have us believe. The
country is at peace in the midst
of a Bedlam, on the inside look
ing out, as it were. But of course
even a war is desirable to a peace
given us by a Democratic ad
ministration. If Mr. Hughes
can make the American people
believe that white is black then
he surely deserves an iron cross
and a 'von' tacked on to his
name. '
"It is true that the politicians
could not stem the tide that
even " a popular Roosevelt"
could not stem the tide of in
fluence of the German-American
Alliance turned in favor of its
candidate, Hughes.
" The G. 0. P. was grasping
at a straw, and, believe, it was
a real, natural straw that it did
grasp, which will act as any
straw would under the circumstances.
"It is true that Americanism
is aroused, an Americanism that
will demonstrate to the world
there is such a thing as national
unity extant in the United
States, and which will manifest
its blazing glory by a sweeping
landslide with Mr. Wilson on
top."
