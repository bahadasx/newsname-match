. Grconvlllo, Ky., Aug. 28. An
jcuto phuso of tho controversy be
tween the mine operators nntl mlno
workers was precipitated Monady
when It was learned thnt the Central
Coal nnd Iron company, of Central
iCIty, had fortified Its property with
machine pun.
Just recently 'he minors of tho
district hal ngreed to accept tho old
scale for labor with tho exception of
two or three questions relating to
the working conditions which had
I. e un agreed to bo left to arbitration
hy committees rcpresontlngthe op
erators and United Mlno Workers of
America.
It is said that the Central Cltr
Val and Iron company, of Central
1'ity, was one o' the flrapin District
"J, to accept the old scale without
ooudltions. The company's mlno
continued to run ufter all tho others
nnd been closed by reason of tho
xalners wallclui out. About four
M-eeks ago the tlprlo of tho company
vas burned. 5. C GIsh, vico presi
dent of tho Central Coal and Iron
company, stated nt the time that ho
would decline to rebuild unless the
minors would agree to nccept a ten
per cent straight reduction In wn
es. New Proposition.
A meeting of tho miners of tho
Central City local was callod and tho
proposition put up to them. A ma
jority of thoso present and voting
voted to accept the coal company's
proposition and ngreed to tho dis
count. Tho vote at tho meeting Is
said to have stood twenty-nlno vot
ing in favor of tho proposition and
twenty-one voting against It. Upon
tho result of tho vote being known
the work of rebuilding tho tipple
was begun. Another meeting wns
held and tho union miners by a voto
of 72 to 29 turned down the propo
sition. After work on the company's tlp
ile wnB begun, In view of tho later
agreement by some of tho miners to
nccept a ten per cent straight reduc
tion, union officials say that they dis
couraged tho men In every way pos
sible from working for tho company.
As a result, th,ey say, out of 250
men usually employed by tho com
pany" only between fifty nnd sixty re
turned to work.
Machine Gun Mounted.
Monday afternoon employes of tho
coal company were seen engaged In
placing In position between tho en
trance of tho mlno shaft and the
Illinois Central railroad a machine
gun of tho Colt's Gatlin gun typo, 45
caliber. The gun was placed on
a heap of slag nnd n fortification
rampart consisting of twelve-Inch
posts built around It. Tho area en
closed occupies a space of approxi
mately ton square feet.
Tho officials of tho miners organi
zation have expressed themselves as"
doubtful as to tho llnal outcome of
tho action of tho company In placing
n rapid flro machine gun In a peace
ful community. Especially Is this
calculated to cause trouble, they
say, as there has boon' no threats
against proporty or llfo on tho parts
of tho miners.
Mr, GIsh, ofthe company, said
that ho was under no apprehension
of trouble from tho minors. His "pur
pose, ho said, In placing Ihe sun on
tho premtses and In Its present po
sition was solely for tho protection
of his property. It was stated Mon
day that tho company had a socond
gun of a similar typo in reserve.
To Form Now Union.
A meeting was called for Monday
night at Central City by C. W.
Wells, mayor of the city; J. W.
Wright, former state senator, and
V. B. Hicks, former secretary and
treasurer of tho United Mlno Work
ers of America, of District 23 for
the purpose of organizing an entirely
new miners organization. The new
organization will bo called the
Southern Association of Miners. Tho
movement is taken In opposition of
tho organization of the United Mlno
Workers of America.
If tho organization Is perfected, it
Is claimed that tho Central Coal and
Iron company has promised It a bet
ter contract than Is enjoyed by nny
other organization of mine workers
In the district.

rangements are being made In all
parts of tho country to prepare for
the strike of 400,000 railroad em
ployes, who are to quit work Monday,
unless some means are found to set
tle the trouble between the railroads
and tlieir employers.
Railroads of the nation rushed
preparations today to enforcq the
embargo on perishable freight. Ship
ments of livestock and perishables
were refused by some roads today;
others Issued warnings that perish-,
ablo freight, which cannot reach Its
destination by Saturday, September
2, will not be accepted.
Orders were flashed to ticket
agents to Inform passengers that un
less they reach their destinations by
Sunday to "perplexing delays."
Big manufacturers and business
houses swamped telegraph compan
ies with messages urging that their
shipments bo rushed at once. Many
of them authorized sending their or
ders by express. Some largo com
mercial houses already have recalled
their traveling representatives.
Speed Up Plans.
Operating officials of many of tho
big railway systems speeded up plans
to meet any emergency and private
detective agencies engaged to em
ploy additional holp, wero urged to
more activity. Physical examinations
of thousands of former railroad men,
who, officials said, are willing to re
turn to tho coach and cab was has
tened. Shopmen and engine hostlers, who
know something about running loco
motives, wero coached for a moro
Important duty expected of thorn.
Guarantees of bonuses and protection
attracted many men who have had
experience In firing boilers and oper
ating stationary engines.
In many of tho larger cities ways
nnd means aro blng discussed to pro-
vent suffering duo to lack of food
and supplies, while some of tho chief
rallrouds are. trying to make arrange

all parts of tho country indicated
that within forty-eight hours, uuless
a dolny In tho strike is ordered, em
bargo orders will bo effective on
practically every railroad In the coun

RAILROADERS FACE LOSS
OF PENSIONS IN STRIKE
Baltimore, Aug. 30. Many em
ployes of the Baltimore and Ohio
railroad, affiliated with the four un
ions which are on the point of strik
ing, aro not anxious to go out because
a loss of their positions, according to
nn official of tho company, will mean
the loss of the savings of a life-time
Invested in the Insurance depart
ment bf the company.
This also applies to the employes
of the Pennsylvania Railroad Compa
ny. Tho Insurance department of
tho Baltimore & Ohio Company is
older than that of the Pennsylvania
Company, however, and Its savings
fund Is larger.
Another phaso of tho case appeals
to the older men In tho service of
both companies. There aro nun-'
dreds of them who are approaching '
tho age of 70 years, whon they will '
bo retired on pensions If they remain '
in tho service. If they strike they
face tho loss of this pension.
