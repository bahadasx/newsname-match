LONDON, Sept. 1.—A serious revo
lution has broken out In northern
Greece and according to Salonika re
ports, King Constantino has abdicated
the throne.
Official dispatches from Salonika
this afternoon announced that the
revolutionists are In control of one
district In Macedonia. The gov
ernment forces In the Macedonian
town of Vodena have joined the revo
lutionists. The Greek troope in Sa
lonika were disarmed and interned by
the Anglo-French foroes, afters crowd
of revolutionists had laid siege to the
garrison and fighting had resulted.
Athens apparently Is cut off from
communication with the outside
world. No confirmation of the Sa
lonlka reports of King Constantino's
abxllbation have come from the Greek
capital, but it Is known that a revo
lutionary party flavoring the allies
was secretly active.
The twenty-six year old crown
prince George, according to Salonika
reports, assumed the regency follow
ing his father's abdication. An idol
of the Greek people and pro-ally In
sympathies, he Is understood to have
the backing of ex-Premiear Venlxelos,
leader of the pro-war party.
The Greek crown prince Is very
popular with his people and Is gen
erally understood to be pro-ally in his
sympathies though he received his
military education at a German
academy and holds an honorary com
mission In the Prussian guard. He
participated in the last two Balkan
wars as an officer In the Greek army.

Willoox, chairman of the republican
national committee believes that
Colonel Roosevelt's first .speech in
behalf of Charles B. Hughes, at Lew

of great value to the republican can
didate, hut la a "noteworthy contribu

Plunging into the Maine campaign,
the colonel assailed the Wilson ad
ministration for its Mexican policy,
flayed hyphenism and held President
Wilson responsible for "an evil Re
vival of non-American and anti
American division along politico-ra
cial lines."
This is due primarily, the colonel
said "to the fact that President Wil
son has lacked the courage and the
vision to lead this nation in the
path of high duty, and by this lack of
affirmative leadership has loosened
the moral fibre of our people, weak
