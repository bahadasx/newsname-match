The Farmers' Paper
Believes Strike
is Averted
Passage of. Adamson Eight Hour
Day Bill Will Avert Strike
Is Expected to Pass
Tomorrow
Washington, Aug. 31.—Belief
grows in all quarters here to
night that ^he great railroad
strike called for next Monday
morning would be averted.
At the close of a day of con
ferences nnd hearings, congress
apparently was prepared to pass
tomorrow' or Saturday the eight
hour day legislation which heads
of the employes' brotherhoods
have declared officially will
cause them to telegraph the
code message necessary to re
voke the strike order.
Altlio President Wilson still
desires strongly to see his whole
legislative program accepted
Stnd democratic leaders in the
senate have ideas of their own
about what should be done, ad
ministration spokesmen virtual
ly conceded tonight that the bill
finally passed would provide on
ly for:
An eight hour day for trainmen
in interstate commerce, effective
Dec. 1 or Jan. 1, with the present
10 hour rate of pay and pro ra
ta overtime, and
A commission appointed by
the president to investigate the
working of the law from six to
nine months and report to con
gress
This, with the dale Dec. 1, is
in substance the Adomson bill,
revised by Representative Adam
son and Democratic Leader Kit
chin, after conferring with Pres
ident Wilson, and which A. 15.
Garretson, spokesman for the
brotherhood, stated formally late
today would be considered a
"satisfactory settlement"' and
prevent the walkout.
Tonight the senate interstate
commerce committee agreed to
report out a similar bill with the
date Jan. 1 and roads under 200
miles in length excepted.
The house will meet at 11 o'
clock to begin consideration of
its committee's bill with the ad
ministration leaders determine
ed to keep the body in continu
ous session until it is passed.
Only long speeches in the sen
ate can prevent prompt action
and the administration is confi
dent that minority senators will
net carry their opposition so far
as to make it impossible to get
the necessary legislation thru
both houses by midnight Sat
urday.
President Wilson will be in his
room at the capitol when the sen
rite meets and has arranged to
spend all of the forenoon there
aiding in putting the legislation
thru.
While the senate commrtlee to
day was holding a nine hour
hearing at which representatives
of the railroads, the employes
and the shippers gave their views
on the situation and the presi
dent held frequent cnferences
with members of the committee
and sent for brotherhood leaders
and earnestly urged them to
rescind the strike order.
When the trainmen left, the
White House authorized the
-statement that they had given no
•assurances. It was indicated
that the president still intended,
if it became necessary as a last
resort, to address a public appeal

FRAZIER TO
STAND BY LEAGUE
Lynn J. Frazier, Republican
candidate for governor of North
Dakota will stand by the Non
partisan league platform, irres
pective of action taken by the
Republican stale central commit
tee when tliat body meets in Bis
marck Sept. 6.
In an interview published in
the current edition of The Non
partisan leader, Mr. Frazier de
clares that he will stand by the
league program from start to
finish—and he also maintains
I hat it is up to the Republican
committee to formulate a pro
gram that is in aecord with the
Nonpartisan platform.
Mr. Frazier takes the position
that the Republican voters of the
state, when they nominated him
by a majority over a 11
rival candidates accepted his per
sonal platform—which is the
platform of the Nonpartisan
league. In view of that fact, he
maintains it is up to the Repub
lican cominitt ee to take cogni
zance of the primary election
vole as relates to the candidates,
and as to the platform.
For some lime it has been re
ported that an attempt might be
made to secure the adoption of a
platform at the committee meet
ing that would be antagonistic to
the league's platform.
