BILL IN SENATEI
PARTISAN ATMOSPHERE WILL
PREVAIL WHILE DISCUS
SION IS ON.
Washington.--With Senator Sim
mons, chairman of the finance com
mittee, submitting figures designed to
disprove Republican charges of Demo
ocratic extravagance and Senator
Smoot, Republican tinance expert, as
serting that the Democratic party
should be convicted of attempting to
procure votes under false pretenses,
general debate on the $205,000,000
emergency revenue bill began in the
Senate.
There were indications on every
hand of a partisan battle royal to be
waged for several days.
Insisting that national defense, ]
paredness and the Mexican situatfb
were altogether responsible
necessity of special revenue legil7
t ion and proposed bond issue. Sen or
Simmons declared Republicans iln i
('ongress had clamored for even grat. (
or expenaltures for defense, and. bav- 1
ing done this, were seeking partisan 1
advantage by making false charges of
Democratic extravagance to the pub
lie.
Senator Smoot, opening the Repub- I
lican assault on the revenue bill, said
if the Democratic party were to be
retained in cont ol of the government
The country would "suffer an era of
unequaled extravagance comtined
with inefficiency unsurpassed." His
attack was supported by Senator Cur- i
tis.
To prove his contention that nor
mal appropriations of this session
were not excessive, Senator Simmons
submitted Treasury Department esti
mates for the year 1917, showing that,
excluding postal appropriations, bond
issues already authorized and amounts 1
that will not be expended, revenues
must be provided for disbursements
of $1.126.243,000. Of this amount the
total appropriated for national de-1
fense wouin. aggregate about $654,000,
000 and the senator submitted other
figures to prove that this extraordi
nary amount, due to preparedness and
the Mexican emergency, exceeded nor
mal defense appropriations by about 1
$.72,:s0,000.
American Cargo Seized.
Waslhington.-Possibility that seiz
ure at Hong Kong of American goods
on the British steamer Kafue from

ilar seizure on the steamer Chinese
Prince and two Spanish vessels, may
foreshadow a general interference
with American trade with the Philip
pines and led the State Department
to ask for-full details from the Amer
cian consul at Hong Kong with the
view of making a strong protest.
Equipment Decreased.
Chicago.--There were 7,342 less
freight cars and 815 less locomotives
in service in the United States at the
close of the fiscal year 1915 than at i
the c(lose of 1914, says the current
number of the Railway Age Gazette, i
notwithstanding the natural growth
in the demand for railway equipment
from year to year."

ITALY FORMALLY AT
WAR WITH GERMANY
OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT HAS
AROUSED GREAT ENTHU
SIASM AT ROME.
CROWDS PARADING STREETS
Italy's Position Has Been Anomalous
Since She Withdrew From the
Alliance and Declared War
on Austria.
Rome.--Baron Sonnino, minister of
reign affairs, announces that Italy
0onsiders herself in a state of war
~ Germany.
The official announcement of a
state of war between Italy and Ger
Imany has aroused great enthusiasm
'here. Cheering crowds are parading
the streets. applauding the govern
ment's decision.
Italy and Germany have been drift
ing steadily toward war. In fact,
Italy's formal declaration amounts to
little more than official recognition of
a state of affairs which already ex
isted. The declaration became inevi
table when Italy recently sent troops
to Saloniki to co-operate in the cam
paign on the Macedonian front, as
Germany is directing the forces and
has troops on the battle line.
Italy's position has been anomal
ous since she withdrew from the tri
ple alliance and declared war on
Austria. Although by this act she at
rayed herself against her former al
lies, Germany and Austria, she re
mained officially at peace with Ger
many until recently. Germany exert
ed every effort to induce her to re
main neutral, sending to Rome as am
bassador Prince von Buelow, one of
the ablest statesmen of Germany.
The prince for some time averted
the war between Austria and Italy,
and when he saw a rupture was inevi
table he negotiated a special agree
ment under which in case of war be
tween Austria and Italy, Germany and
Italy pledged themselves to respect
the properties and lives of their re
spective subjects in each others do
mains. This meant for Germany a
guarantee of many millions of dollars'
worth of properties in Italy and for
Italy the safety of 30,000 Italian sub
jects in Germany.
According to unofficial reports,
Italy's allies were dissastisfied and
asked the Italian representatives at
the Paris entente conference why
their nation was not at war with Ger
many. Italy already had agreed not
to conclude a separate peace and at
the Paris conference sanctioned the
plan for a permanent high council of
the entente powers for future conduct
of the war. The increasing co-opera
tion among the entente allies and the
necessity for bringing into service
Italy's surplus of troops, which could
not be employed on the other fronts
without bringing on war with
Germany, gradually brought Italy into
such a position that it became evident
a declaration of hostilities against
Germany was only a matter of time.
Woman Is Put to Death.
Paris.--Mille. Felice Pfaat was put
to death at the Lighthouse shooting
range at Marseilles, having been con
victed of espionage by the ('ouncil of
War of the Fifteenth region.
Will Go to Baltimore.
Washington.-President Wilson de
cided to go to Baltimore during the
last week in September to speak be
fore a convention of the National
Grain Dealers' Association.
GERMAN SUBMARINE
SURPRISE TO OWNEIS
DEUTSCHLAND TRAVELED 4.200
MILES ON HER HOMEWARD
VOYAGE.
london.---lReports of the return of
the Germlan submarine Deutschland
from the United States are corrobo
rated in a telegram received at Am
sterdam from Bremen. as forwarded
by Renter's correspondent.
According to this information, the
Deutschland traveled 4,'00 miles on
her homeward voyage. At the begin
ning the sea was tempestuous, but la
ter it became, more calm. The Deutsch
land proved to bhe able to navigate
the stormy seas excellently. lier en
gines worked faultlessly. No ice
bergs were passed on the journey.
The American government, says the
dispatch. acted in a correct manner as
a neutral, rigorously enforcing re
spect for its frontier from British and
French warships by the employment
of its own men of war.
After a British cruiser entered
Chesapeake Bay at night more effec
tive measures were taken to en
force neutrality. No less than eight
British warships, it is said. were on
the alert, surrounded by numerous
small American vessels which had
been chartered for the purpose of
placing nets and obtaining informa
tion as to the movements of the
Deutschland. Nevertheless the sub
marine succeeded in leaving undetect
ed. A distance of 100 miles was tra
versed under water without difficulty.
The Deutschland returned home
slightly damaged, according to an
Exchange Telegraph dispatch from
The Hauge, which says this informa
tion is contained in a telegram from
Bremen. The members of the crew
were unwilling, it adds, to give de
tails of the return voyage.
The arrival of the submarine sur
prised her owners, as she was not ex
pected to dock within a week.
Medical Aid Civilizes.
New York.-In an attempt to ad
vance civilization through tile me
dium of medical relief, the Philippine
government co-operating with the in
ternational health board of the Rocke
feller Foundation, will send a hospital
ship to the Sulu Archipelago, Inhabit
ed by approximately 200,000 Moros
and other savage tribes. The medical
service will be maintained five years.
Assails Paper Trust.
Washington.-Senator Martine of
New Jersey assailed the so-called pa
per trust on the floor of the Senate
because of the high price of news
print paper and submitted an amend
ment to the revenue bill to place
news print paper and materials en
tering into it on the free list of the
tariff.

population of ,.000. Roumnnians
make up a large part of the popula
tion of both cities.
Roumania is the fourteenth nation
to enter the war. Ever since the vrear
conflict began. it "ias been expected
that she would join one side or the
other.
Her joining the allies is considered
a great triumph for them, not only
because of her military resources. but
because of her geographical position.
Russian troops passing through Rou
mania now can attack the VIulgarians
from the north, while the allied army.
with its base at Saloniki, attacks
them and their Teutonic allies from
the south.
Roumania has a population of U.S00.
000, and her army is estimated at
580,000. As to its effectiveness, there
is a radical difference in opinion. It
has been describled as one of the most
thoroughly equipped and best disci
plined armies in Europe. but recent re
ports have contradicted this. Recent
ly it has been said that tihe officers
are ill trained and undisciplined, that
the army lacks heavy arillery and
that its flying equiptwnt is inferior.
