Teachers are Arriving and
Preparing for School
Work
The Cut Bank school will
open on Tuesday, Sept, 5th,

teachers who have been away
on their vacations are arriving.
Principal Fairbrother has con
tributed the following letter,
addressed to the students:
To Our High School Students:
In sending you this greeting I
naturally think of what you may make
of yourselves, and of the great good
you may do this great state of Mon
tana and the whole country by making
something of yourselves that is noble
and worth while.
I have had a great deal to do with
teaching young people, and it has
sometimes discouraged and saddened
me to feel that they thought that «he
school work was a bore and that the
only real thing was the thing they
were set free to do after school hours,
I have had as much fun as anybody in
my time and hope that you will
have unlimited good times, but I wish I
could make you realize now that play
has nothing in it unless back of it lies
good honest hard work, fitted to harden
the fibre of every part of the mind and
make it an instrument that we can
work with, achieve with, and do what
we please with.
The really happy men and women
are the men and women who can do
tbeir job, and the men and women who
can do their lob best are those who
have given themselves tbe best dis
cipline and training If you s {T>ake the
most of yourselves, you will be able to
give a great gift of duty finely per
formed to the country which we all
love and which we all ought to try to
serve by making our own lives what
we should like to have everybody be
lieve the life of every American to be.
My exhortation is, enter our high
school next Tuesday. Prepare your
selves to be sample Americans and
make the sample very line.
Faithfully Yours,
Benj. H. Fairbrother,
Supt. of Sohools
Railways Prepare
for Big Strike
The big railway strike is set
for Monday morning next and
the railways are now making
every preparation to meet it,
realizing that negotiations are
of no avail. No perishable
matter is now being received
and passengers are notified that
if they start on trips that will
require longer than Sunday
evening to reach the destination
they asssme the risk. A
bulletin has been posted in the
local station notifying employes
that those who remain loyal
will retain seniority rights and
those who strike will forfeit
them.
Mrs. E. M. Davis and little son
Harris left Sunday evening for
a visit with relatives at Lisbon,

Franchise Matter
is Postponed
The electric light franchise
applications of Lewis and Albin
of Cut Bank and Mr. Howver
of Great Falls were deferred
for consideration and action at
the next regular meeting. The
town fathers appreciate the
fact thatsentimentin faver of a
lighting franchise is strong in
Cut Bank, but before taking
final action they desire to fully
familiarize themselves with
rates and other phases of the
question.
Considerable time was spent
in discussing the condition of
the walks and grade on lower
Broadway, which at the present
time resembles a settlement in
the Solomon Island?, with its
buildings zig-zagging and its
walks every-which-way. It
was decided to secure the
services of Engineer Swearingen
of Great Falls to survey this
section and it is quite probable
that uniformity will soon be
attained. A survey will also
be made to establish a grade in
other sections of the city.
J. Lebeck, for years employed
as a railway watchman, was
placed on the police force at
the suggestion of Mayor Potter.
Lebeck is a big, brawny fellow
and possesses the appearance of
a man who will "go through"
with the rough element that has
swarmed into the city the past
few weeks. Lebeck and Rich
ards will probably be kept busy
for the next several months.
Five Elevators
The Prospect
If competition in the local
grain market is to be a factor in
making for top-notch prices
this autumn, our Cut Bank
farmers should feel encouraged
because of the number of
houses that will compete for
their products.
The St. Anthony & Dakota
Elevator Co. this week com
menced the erection of a 30,000
bushel elevator, directly west
of the Greely-Schmidt house.
Work on the new house will be
pushed with all possible speed.
Mr. J. C. Hogan, who will man
age this new house, states that
the elevator will be equipped
with all the latest appliance for
the speedy handling of grain.
The Pioneer Press learns that
the Gallatin Milling Co. has had
a representative looking over
the local field and that this well
known concern has just about
decided to come into the Cut
Bank field, after becoming
satisfied that there was no more
promising gram zone in all
Montana than the Cut Bank
section.

Complete primary election returns from Clioteau
were not available this morning a-id it may be several days
before exact figures on contested offices can be obtained.
Telephone service between here and Choteau was very
defective until last evening.
It seems practically settled, on the republican side,
that Dean has beaten Zimmerman for sheriff, Guthrie is
nominated treasurer by a good margin, Stufft has a big lead
for commissioner, Martine has beaten Jacobson for clerk
of court, Ward is slightly leading Barnett for surveyor,
Hattersley has been nominated for county attorney, Co
burn and McDonald have won out on the legislative ticket.
On the democratic side Greene has beaten Verge for
county attorney, Miller has won the nomination for sher
iff, Mrs. Bowman is the nominee for county superintendent,
Bomboy has been nominated for coroner and Putt for
auditor, Davis and Ferris are the legislative nominees.
Teton county seems to be emphatically republican.
There were 294 votes cast in the Cut Bank precinct and
the republicans lead by 58 votes. The republican lead in
the other big precincts appears to be quite decisive.
Later returns may change the complexion of the above
line-up, but figures obtained by the Pioneer Press shortly
before press time lead to the conclusion that a change is
unlikely.
1 he dominant porties will soon perfect their organiza
tions and the battle of party against party vvill be on with
in a week or ten days.
Many State Contests Are Still Very
Much In Doubt
Partial returns from 22 counties make it certain that
Charles N. Pray will be the republican candidate for sena
tor, Miss Rankin and either Fall or Linderman for con
gress, and F. J. Edwards for governor. Partial returns
from eight counties give Annin a big lead for the lieuten
ant governorship, Boyle for railroad commissioner, and
Trumper for state superintendent; Rhoades has a fair lead
for the auditorship, and Brown is leading for attorney
general, Hart for treasurer, and Hazelbaker for secretary
of state, but additional returns may displace Brown for
Ford, Hedrick for Hart and possibly Stewart for Hazel
baker.
Charley Pray got the biggest vote of any republican
candidate and is leading J. E. Edwards for the senatorship
by nearly 5,000. Miss Rankin is in second place and is
leading Farr by nearly 4,000 votes, with Linderman third
and a good chance to gain when the northern Montana
vote comes in.
Only two places are in doubt on the democratic ticket
—whether Cutts or Mitchell will win the second place on
the congressional ticket and whether Superintendent Davee
or Miss O'Donnell will be nominated for state superin
tendent.
Senator Myers has been re-nominated for senator,
Go vernor Stewart as a candidate to succeed himself, Mc
Dowell for lieutenant governor, Evans for congress, Poin
dexter for attorney general, Swindlehurst for secretary of
state, Cullerton for treasurer, Keating for auditor, John
son for railroad commissioner, Patterson for chief justice
and Carroil for clerk of the
The Election
in Cut Bank
The Cut Bank precinct show
ed its good will and loyalty
toward the home candidates of
both parties. John W. Coburn
lead all his opponents for the
office of representative. Harry
Putt received a very good vote
for county auditor and T. B.
Bombly lead all the others for
coronor by a good margin.
Frank Stufft was given a splen
did tribute by his home people
many democrats taking occa
sion to write his name on their
ballot. This is a good spirit.
It surely proves that no petty
envy nor spite influences our
people when their neighbors
aspire to public favor. M. A.
O'Neil, who was unopposed in
either party for public admin
istrator, was given a splendid
vote also. Mr. O'Neil will have
clear sailing and he is no doubt
the envy of many candidates,
who will now have to begin on
another hot battle for election.
Chas. N. Thomas and Frank
E. VanDemark are the repub
lican nominees for justice of
the peace of this township, re
ceiviug a heavy vote. Alex
McGlouhery is the democratic
nominee for that office. Bruce
R. McNamer was chosen re
publican precinct committee
man from the second ward and
R. L. Taft from the first. S. J.
Rigney and P. A. Davis are the
democratic committeemen from
the first and second ward,
rbsf irtively.

Coal Consumers
Should Buy Now
Railway Commission
Advising Public to
Buy Early
is
A circular letter recently sent
out by the State Railway
Commission advises people to
lay in their winter's supply of
coal now. The commission
predicts a scarcity of freight
cars in the west this autumn.
It recalls the hardships suffered
last winter in parts of Montana,
on account of the cual shortage
and concludes:
It would seem a wise plan to
ship coal, if possible, before the
big movement of wheat starts.
This can be done without any
additional expense, and the
price of coal is usually less and
a better freight service can be
insured. There was quite a
serious coal shortage during the
severe weather in January and
February which was caused by
shippers of coal relying on the
movement being constant dur
ing the severe weather. Ship
pers and consumers of coal are
urged to store same to their
fullest capacity in order to
obviate any shortage or suffer
ing during possible storms in
the winter months. A little
attention on the part of the
public will be of great benefit.
In so doing you are not helping
the b?Tisportation companies
so much as you are the general
public.

294 votes were cast in the Cut
Bank unit, both precincts, the
Republicans led the democrats
by 58 votes. The Pioneer Press
is not able give readers exact
figures but it is our belief that
women cast 40 per cent of the
vote here.
