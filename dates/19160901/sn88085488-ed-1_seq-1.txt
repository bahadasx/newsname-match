VOLUME XXVIII
OVER 5000 MILES ON
AUTOMOBILE TRIP
Dr. and Mrs. E. A. Archer and Sons
Return .After Irfiiift Pleasure
Trip Through Eleven States
After traveling 5373 miles by au
tomobile and passing through 12
different states, Dr. and Mrs. E. A.;
Archer and two sons returned to
Pullman Monday night, bringing re- !
ports of a trip which abounded in j
pleasure and excitement, with just I
enough incidental trouble to make
it worth while. The party left Pull
man July 8 in the Archer Stude
baker six, will full camping regalia.
After visiting Mr. Archer's relatives
in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the
party proceeded to Cedar " Palls, j
lowa, where Mrs. Archer's relatives
were visited, the doctor going on
to Kansas City to attend the nation- ,
al osteopathic convention.
The going trip was over the Lin
coln highway and consumed 14 days, 1
the party proceeding somewhat leis- 1
urely and enjoying the outing. The j
average mileage going was 189 x /_ j
miles per day. Returning, the trip
was over the Yellowstone trail.
Eleven days were required for the
homeward journey, and an average
mileage of 169 miles each day was j
maintained.
For the entire trip the average
mileage to each gallon of gasoline
was slightly over 15 miles, which is j
an exceptionally good record when j
the nature of some of the roads is j
considered. Practically no machine I
trouble wus experienced, the casings!
being taken from tho working parts
for oiling purposes only. The usual
tire trouble added excitement to the
journey, greater trouble being ex- 1
perienced from this source on the!
going trip than returning.
The trip took the Archers through
Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah,
Montana. Colorado, Kansas, Nebras- !
ka. lowa, North and South Dakota 1
anil Montana. ;
Dr. Archer reports a very short
fruit crop in the southern Idaho
country, and much damage to wheat
in Kansas, the Dakotas and Mon- j
tana. In Kansas the wheat crop was
ravaged by the Hessian fly and a
considerable acreage was plowed up i
and re-planted to corn, which in turn'
has suffered heavily by burning.
In southern lowa and the south half
of South Dakota the crops are in
good shape, but in the north half j
of South Dakota and a large part of ,
North Dakota and eastern Montana j
black rust has made serious inroads!
on the wheat crop. Thousands upon j
thousands of acres will never be cut,.
being unfit even for chicken feed, I
while the yi^ld .of that which ,4
threshed is running as low as two to j
nine bushels per acre of a very infer-1
ior grade.

EIGHT-HOUR MEASURE
TO AVERT R. R. STRIKE
WASHINGTON, Aug. 81. —
will pass the eight-hour hill intro
duced today in the house, tomorrow.
That will include the provision for an
investigation of the eight-hour day
on the railroads. That, we believe,
will prevent the strike," said Chair
man Adamson of the house interstate
commerce committee, this morning.
"Enactment into law of the presi
dent's eight-hour bill as now drawn,
guaranteeing the present 10-hour
day wage," said W. G. Lee, head of
the trainmen's brotherhood, "will be
regarded as a satisfactory settlement
of our difficulties with the railroads
and there will he no strike.. In order
to Prevent a strike, however, this bill
must become a law before next Sat
urday midnight."
The above dispatch, which appear
ed in last night's Chronicle, comes as
* distinct relief, inasmuch as it indi
cates an early settlement of the dif
ferences between the railroads and
toeir employes and is expected to
&vert the long threatened strike. . .
Rev. c. H. Harrison and Prof. C.
M- Brewster returned Wednesday
evening from thoir vacation, which
*as spent in an auto trip, during
which they visited many points on

PULLMAN. WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER I. 1916
$65,000 FIRE DESTROYS EMERSON I
AND LEE ALLEN STOCKS FRIDAY
Fire Raged Five Hours Despite Best Efforts of
Department—Most of Loss Covered by i
Insurance—Stores in New Quarters.
:
The most disastrous fire since
Pullman was almost entirely wiped
off the map in 1890 occurred last
Friday night, when the building at
the corner of Main and Alder streets,
owned by Mrs. Stock well of Cali
fornia and occupied by the Emerson
Mercantile company and Lee Allen's
hardware store, was completely gut
ted, entailing a loss conservatively
estimated at $66,000.
Nothing could be taken from the
hardware store except the delivery
automobile, which was taken out
through the rear door, and the big
stock of heavy and shelf hardware,
crockery, tinware, glassware, china,
etc., was almost totally destroyed.
Valiant efforts on the part of a hun
dred citizens resulted In the savin.
ol considerable stock from the Em
erson store before the flames had
reached that part of the building.
Approximately one-fourth of the Em
erson stock had been removed to the
new building, on the opposite' corner,
before' the fire, and probably as
much more was saved Friday even
ing, the balance, totaling about $40,
--000, being destroyed.
The Lee Allen stock would have
invoiced in the neighborhood of $10,
--000, and the various insurance' poli
cies totaled $11,000. Although
there will be considerable salvage,
the loss to Mr, Allen, over ami above
the Insurance, will run into the thou
sand- of dollars. Th* Emerson sti i-k
was covered with Insurance '.o the
extent of approximately &0 per cent.
Damage to the building is estimated
at about $9000, with $6500 in
surance.
The fire was of unknown origin,
dense smoke emitting from the- rear
of tha hardware store attracting the
attention of passersby at about
10:30. The alarm was sounded and
within a lev minutes several streams
of water were being played on the
flames, which reached a quan.' ty of
oil in the store room and baffl -d the
efforts of the fire fighters. The fire
soon enveloped the roof of the store
and spread, along the roof, to the
Emerson store to the east. Every
foot of fire hose in th_ city was
brought into use and water was
poured into the burning building
through seven lines until 3:00
o'clock Saturday morning, when
nothing but the walls of the buildin.
were standing and the near $60,
stock was a mass of smoulderin.

The members of the fire depart
ment and citizen volunteers foi jhi
heroically in the face of great, odds
for nearly five hours. The efforts - I
the fire-fighters were greatly ham
pered through the lack of chemi-
the water having little effect upon
the burning oils in the rear of the
hardware store. Had a chemical en

tank been at hand during the first
' few minutes of the fire it is not im

the entire east end of the north side
of Main street was menaced, and a
large amount of the Thorpe stock ',
was removed to the streets, Damage
to the extent of $200 or $300 was
done to the Henry building and lin

William Klossner, chief of the fire

was badly cut on the' knee while as

Seven stitches were required to close
the wound and the injured man now

The quiet atmosphere on the night
of the fire was providential, as a
wind, in any direction, might have:
caused a much more serious confla

to assist in removing stock from the ;

THE WILD AND/WOOLY WEST
During his visit here with rela

of Seymour, brother of Klza Jackson,
the south side shoe merchant, told
his friends of an unusual incident
that happened to himself and a
friend while traveling on the wild
country road out from Pullman,
Wash., where he now resides. They
were compelled, he stated, to stop
and allow a herd of 18 wild elk to
pass across the road ahead of them.
The Incident happened in the wilds
of a government game preservation
and only for this they would have
had an elk or two had they so de
sired. — Bedford (Ind.) Dally Mail.
Note—lt has been suggested that
the herd of wild elk referred to may

that case the Pullman mayor used
