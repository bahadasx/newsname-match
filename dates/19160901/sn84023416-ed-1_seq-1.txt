NEW BUSINESS.
Essex County and Island Pond
Hold Out Opportunities Un
surpassed for New Business
Business enterprises are ever seek
ing new fields in which to locate.
Places are carefully looked over and
every detail that is necessary to suc
cesssul operation considered and
carefully estimated, and the place
offering the best opportunities and
has good freight transportation is
selected.
Vermont is known as an agricul
tural state, but the steady progress
it has made, and is making, places it
among the states that are leading in
manufactures.
Every section of the state offers
opportunities for'successful business,
and there is no place in the state
where better opportunities await
the coming of these enterprises than
Essex county in general and Island
Pond in particular. This section
compared with many other places in
the state is new in its settlement, and
it has much to offer new business
that is wanting in other places.
Island Pond is well located for
manufacturing industries, especially
in the line of woodworking. Thous
anes of acres of timber operated
under the conservation methods of
forestry development will furnish
continuously abundance of raw ma
terial at a price making manufactur
ing profitable. Located on the main
line of a great railway system with
a terminal oi the Atlantic seaboard
and a direct route to western points,
it offers shipping facilities unsurpas
sed in the state. This village can
I offer threenecessary requisites to
new business for successful opera
tion. Schools, churches and social
life that makes ideal homes for op
eratives, an abundance of raw ma
terial and a transportation of manu
factured products direct to tha, great
commercial centers.
Manufacturing is not the only good
thing that can be found in Essex
county. In agriculture it is unsur
passed. The land is rich and returns
large crops to all tillers of the soil.
Excellent dairies and model craam
eries are here, and many acres are
waiting development. There are
opportunities here for the farmer
lhat will equal any agricultural sec
tion in Vermont.
There is another feature of Ver
mont that is fast coming into
prominence. This is the beauties of
her mountain, river and lake scen
ery. Nature has deftly moulded
these beauty spots and this county
holds many a gem of those pictur
esque spots for which Vermont is
becoming noted. So whether you
are looking for business, pleasure or
homes don't turn the leaf on Essex
county until you become acquainted
with the wide-open door of opportun
ity that awaits your entrance.
Full particulars will be gladly giv
en by dropping a line to the Board
of Trade', Island Pond, Vt.

ready for the Fall opening of the
high school which has been delayed
by the action of State Superintend

been added to the high school staff
for the coming year. Bookkeeping
and commercial geography will be
added to the high school course of
study arid thorough and practical in
