MOW YORK. August 31.?Although
the prospect of averting the threatened
nation-wide railroad strike was con
sidered encouraging to-night, city of
fi' i > Is and representatives of New
York's industries continued their ef- j
foils to provide against sutferlng in j
a possible emergency.
Commissioner or Police Woods pre
pared an appeal to the railroads and
employees, urging them, in the event
of a strike, to permit food supplies to
reach the city. The commissioner also
i elteratod that he would act vigorously'
against dealers who raised food prices.
Upwards of o.ft.'io carloads of food are I
brought here weekly, much of it perish
able. The department of health esti- '
mates that more than 1.14ft carloads of
fresh milk alone are required weekly.'
fOstimates of the city's needs of flour
run from lnrt.000 to 175,000 barrels a|
week. ?
Fear was expressed to-night that
embargoes already declared by the,
railroads might seriously affect the !
situation, even should the strike be j
called off. The placing to-day of what
was said to amount virtually to a
blanket embargo on all freight by the
Uoiig Island Railroad, which serves the
market gardening section of L.ong
Island, further complicated matters.

Public Eventually
Must Foot the Bill
for Eight-Hour Day
Both Sides to Rail Contro
versy Given Hearing
on Proposed
Legislation.
WASHINGTON, August 31.? Repre
sentatives of the railroads, of the train
men brotherhoods and of shippers' or
ganizations argued for nine hours to
day before the Senate Interstate Com
merce Committee on legislation pro
posed to avert the threatened strike,
recompense the roads for any added
financial burden, and perfect machinery
to make Impossible in the future an
other crisis like the present. To-night
the committee worked until late on the
bill lo be presented to the Senate to
morrow.
Out of the nine hours' argument two
facts stood out clearly.
In the estimation of all affected par
ties Congress alone can prevent a
strike, and the public eventually will
foot the bill for an eight-hour day j
with ten hours' pay. which the train
in.-n demand. The railroad executiv<s
and the shippers insisted that the
strike order at least should be post ?
ported, and the four brotherhood chiefs
declared with equal vehemence it could
not he.
All sides apparently were more or
less satisfied with the hearing which
had given them an opportunty to lay
their cases before the public.
A dramatic scene, in which A. R. Gar
rison, spokesman for the trainmen
and president of the Order of IJailway
Conductors, was the central ?"icrtire,
brought the hearing to a clinia.v to
night shortly before the taking of tes
timony closed.
W'KSTIOX in V a It I a III. V
I'.V ADIOI) B1Y I.AIIOIt MICA IIS !
Throughout the day, members of the i
committee at different times had asked ,
tho four brotherhood heads if the> '
were powerless 10 stop the strike save ,
by reporting a settlement satisfac- j
tory to their men. The question in-I
variably was evaded, the replies being I
that Mr. (iarretson would explain the j
situation before tho hearing closed.
For almost an hour Mr. Carretson j
kept ihe crowd laughing with quaint
expressions and humorous stories, i
When lie had only three minutes left
in which to speak, his brother presi
dents urged him to answer me ques- \
lion of power to postpone a strike. He i
suddenly became serious, stood erect. !
trazed at the. ceiling for a moment and I
then began to speak.
"We have been asked," lie said slow
ly, if wo hive the power to deter this i
strike. It has been called for next
Monday I have the power to defer '
that date in my organization, hut in '
the other organizations the situation !
Is different. The heads of the other
brotherhoods umncf call hack the
strike order.
"Hut here is where 1 stand. l-'or j
years my men have trusted me. When '
I stood before the President the other |
nicht and he asked me if this could be
done, I found my Cethscma lie To the
men who have made me the recipient
of all these things. I owe my lirst obli
gation. I can put it off, but if i did.
without gaining a satisfactory settle
ment. there would linger in the minds
of those who have trusted me thoughts
of treachery. If I put it off, across a
fair record of thirty years would be
written tho word 'Traitor.'"
For a moment the witness paused
and seemed to peer far out tover the

SITUATION BV 1.KAV1XG
Not a person in the room moved for
several seconds. Mr. Garretson re
lieved the situation by rising from his
chair and leaving the chamber.
A. P. Thorn, general counsel for the
Southern Hallway and counsel for the
railway executives' advisory committoc,
closed for the railroads with a summary
of the arguments against the eight
hour day. He said the railroad execu
tives are acting in a fiduciary capacity;
that they must see that there Is a fair
return on the money invested in rail
roads. rind that any wage Increases ire
not distributed to only a comparatively
small part of their employees.
"We do not claim the right to decide
this question," said Mr. Thorn, "any
more than we think that any Interested
party ought to lie allowed to decide it.
We were told that the eight-hour day
is not arbitrable. The answer :o that
Is that these gentlemen would not have
an eight-hour day and would not
accept it if It was tendered to them."
Mr. Thoin said that never in any
legislative act nor in any party plat
form had the position been taken that
a man should work eight hours and
i be paid for ten.
"We promised to keep an account on
? he basis of an eight-hour day whilo
a commission sought to ascertain tho
facts and to pay from the beginning
whenever an award should he made,"
he added. "I call upon your con
sciences to witness whether In this at
titude there is any purpose to deny
human rights or to deal arbitrarily
with any rights of the. employees.
"This crisis, important enough for the
President of the United States to sub
mit the issue to Congress, should be
carefully and deliberately considered.!
Hut here you are denied the right for .
time and deliberation on merits of the
proposal;:. You are told that you must
surrender before next Monday or this >
nation will be plunged into a' calamity i
of starvation and ruin In order that the j
views of a few may prevail."

Mr. Thorn asked what would nappen
if the positions of the trainmen and
of the executives were reversed and j
the oMclals threatened to tie up the j
country.
"Would Congress then wait for one
moment to put the mailed, hard hand I
of government on them?" he asked. |
"Is there any reason that what would
be Justified lit their case is not Justl- \
fled In this?"
Klliot II. flood* in. general secretary1

tually conceded to-night that the1 bill

: the brotherhoods, stated formally lata
to-day would be considered a "satisfac

While the Senate committee to-day
was holding a nine-hour hearing, at
which representatives of the railroads,
the employees and the shippers gavo
their views on the situation and the
proposed legislation, the President held
frequent conferences with members of
Congress and sent for brotherhood
