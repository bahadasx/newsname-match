BROTHERHOODS OPPOSE
INTIMATION THAT LABOR IS

DENIED BY BOTH BRANCHES
(Br Aaaoelaled Press.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 1. From In

tration expected the strike to be
called off before Sunday morning.
A. B. Garretson, spokesman for the
brotherhoods, conferred briefly with
the president at the White House,
later declining to discuss the purport,
Officials said he called to give the
president "some Information." Gar
retson refused to admit or deny that
he discussed calling off the strike.
The Adamson bill was passed late
this afternoon by the House and cent
to the Senate.
The bill passed alter the House
sustained the rule that the provision
to create a permanent board of medi
ation and conciliation was not ger
mane. The 8enata meanwhile recessed
until 8 o'clock tonight, when debate
will be resumed on a similar bill with
a view to action before adjournment,
if possible.

Washington, sept. '1. Troops
en route to or from the border have
been ordered equipped with extra
supplies for the Journey against the
possibility thai a general railroad
strike will delay their movements.
Secretary Baker refused today to
discuss reports that the 15,UUU guards
men were being moved as a precau
tion against strike violence. States
to which the troops are returning are
those where few guardsmen remain,
!ut In most of them large railway
terminals are located.
Approximately 30,000 troops are

ference decided to draft legislation
of their own to offer aa a substitute
for the bill proposed by the Demo
crats.
Bills to avert a Btrike were put on
their way to paBsage In both Houses
of Congress today. Under the special
rule providing for a vote this after
noon the House considered the Adam-
son eight hour bill, approved by the
president and accepted by the broth
erhood leaders as a "satisfactory settlement."
The Senate interstate commerce
committee reported a similar bill con
taining, however, an important pro
vision empowering the Interstate
Commerce commission to fix the
schedule of wages on Interstate rail
roads. The prospects of a hitch seem
to lie In the added provision, which
Is being studied by brotherhood lead
ers. The committee eliminated the pro
posal that on the report of the eight
hour day commission the Interstate
Comerce commission "shall consider
an increase In freight rates to meet
the additional expenditures of the
railroads as may be rendered neces
sary by the adoption of an eight hour
day."
Neither bill contains the Canadian
commission plan which labor leaders
oppose.
Indications are that brotherhood
leaders would fight any proposal to
empower the Interstate Commerce
commission to govern wages as the
Senate bill proposes, but would prob
ably accept it If the Senate deter
mined to Include It In the bill.
In both the Senate and House the
allegation made that labor is holding
up Congress is vehemently denied.
The Senate Republicans Informed
the majority which plans to rush
through the bills framed immediately
will stay In session all night. They
gave over the effort to frame a bill
of their own. .
The House, after considerable dis
cussion, adopted amendments by Page
and Kltchln exempting from the eight
hour law small Independent roads,
electric and Interurban railways pro
viding the exemption does not apply
to terminal or transfer companies.
The amendment applying eight
hours to shopmen, trackmen, station
agents and all other employes npt
mentioned in the bill was rejected
by 80 to 120.

CHICAGO, Sept. 1. Hale Holden,
president of the Chicago, Burlington
