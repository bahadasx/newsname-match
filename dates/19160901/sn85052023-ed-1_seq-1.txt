REFUSE EDUCATION
KOLY ROLLER REFUSES TO SEND
CHILDREN TO SCHOOL
Judge Bailey Fines Two Women $5
Each Under Provisions Of The
Compulsory Education Law
Arguing that "worldly wisdom is
foolishness in the sight of God," "Mrs.
J. E. Johnson, who lives below Way
nesburg refused to send her children
to public school, and when brought
before Judge Bailey in county court
here Thursday, she gave that as her
reason for not obeying the compul
sory education law, under the pro
visions of which she was cited into
court bv County School Inspector
W. H. W. Reynolds. Mrs. Johnson is
said to be a Holy Roller, and she
gave the above as Scriptural cause
for not educating her two children
who are between the ages of 7 and
12. She came into town accom
panied by five small children, the
balance of her brood being under
school age. Mrs. Mary Hail was also
arrested on a similar charge. Judge
Bailey fined the two $5 and costs.
Mrs. Johnson asked the court to send
her to jail but Judge Bailey gave
her 15 days in which to secure the
money, at the end of which time, he
said that he would have her brought
in and placed in jail if she did not
pay the fine.
William Mobley, a Crab Orchard
negro, was held to the grand jury
under 50 bond on a charge of de
serting his infant children, which is
now a felony. He is said to be work
ing in Garrard. Will Adams went

The case against Ray Boone, who
vfes charged with obstructing the
public highway, was continued.
The charge against Ella Vande
veer, colored, of using abusing and
insulting language and "calling out
of her name" Mrs. Humphries, was

Wils
n's Strong Hand Seems To
Have Warded Off Crisis
With the announcement on the
part of the railroad brotherhoods
late Thursday that passage cf the
rroposed eight-hour law would be re
garded as a satisfactory settlement
on their part the belief grew in
Washington that means had been dis
covered to prevent the nationwide
railroad strike. Both the Senate and
House took ud consideration of ihe
legislation today and when finally
passed by both houses, the measure
will be rushed tothe president for his
signature. Little opposition is being
manifested bv the republicans. The
railroads insist that in addition to
the eight-hour law the rest of the
president's program must be passed
before the situation will be accepta
ble to them and the passage of the
eight-hour law alone may precipitate
a court fight on their part.
The Lincoln County Christian Sun
day School Convention was held on
Tuesday, August 29, at Mt. Moriah,
with Rev. D. M. Walker, president
presiding. Inspiring addresses were
delivered during the day.
The devotional exercises were con
ducted by the Mt. Moriah church.
Rev. A. H. Baugh,- of Hustonville
gave an interesting address on "The
North Middletown Church Institute."
The Cradle Roo? Department and
"How to Observe Cradle Roll week"
were discussed by Miss Emma Hays.
Mrs. H. D. Phillips, who is a wide
awake Sunday School worker, gave a
splendid talk on "The School of Meth
ods," which she attended in Lexing
ton in June.
Two of the most interesting fea
tures of the day were the addresses
on "The New Standard of the Bible
Efficiency." and "Seeing America,"
by Rev. Walter E. Frazee, our state
worker, of Louisville.
Rev. L. N. Bowling, pastor of the
Mt. Moriah church, delivered a splen
did address on "The Present Status
of the Rural Church." Rev Bowling
claims that the Rural church should
occupy a place of prominence, but
that it is hindered by the lack of en
ergy, financial matters and incom
pleteness of rural life. Mr. Bowling
is very much interested in the Rural
Churches and is willing to do all in
his power to' help raise the standard
of the Rural Church.
Mr. H. G. Skiles, cashier of the
Crab Orchard Banking Company of
Crab Orchard, was among the speak
ers of the day and added much to the
program.
A sumptuous dinner was served at
the dinner hour by the ladies of the
Mt. Moriah church.
To the Roll Call of Schools by Rev.
Frazee, ten churches responded with
sixty-three delegates and twenty-seven
visitors.
The officers elected for the ensu
ing year are: Rev. D. M. Walker,
President; Mr. H. G. Skiles, Vice
President, and Miss Emma Hays, sec
retary. The next convention will be
held at Crab Orchard.

At the home of the bride in the

was united in matrimony to M. D.

a prosperous automobile dealer of
his home town. The two had been
sweethearts for vears and the an
nouncement of their marriage does
not come as a surnrise to thir im

missed in the West End of the coun

THIS CONCERNS YOU IF YOU ARE AN I. J. SUBSCRIBER
The Interior Journal regrets to be compelled to announce that on
and after October 1 , 1 91 6 its subscription price will be $1 .50 a year.
This step is made absolutely necessary if the paper is to be pub
lished at a profit, and unless it is published at a profit, it cannot be pub
lished at all. Plain white paper, upon which the I. J. is printed, has al
most trebled in price in the last six months. Newspapers all around us in
creased their subscription price as the cost rof white paper went up, but the
I. J. held down to $ 1 a year as long as it possibly could. The Richmond pa
pers, the Harrodsburg papers, the Danville papers arid scores of others
have been selling at $1.50 a year for some time.
In order to make this advance in price as easy as possible on its
many subscribers, the I. J. will give them ample time to protect themselves
if they so desire, at the old $ 1 rate. Subscriptions for as many years in ad
vance as the subscriber wishes to pay for, will be received at $ 1 a year, up
to October 1 st, next. After that date, $ 1 will pay; for the paper for eight
months only; the rate for six months will be 7 5c, and for three months 40c
all subscriptions being payable strictly cash in advance, paper stopping
when time for which it is paid has expired.
Now. is certainly the time to subscribe.

Mr. and Mrs. Skiles entertained
the Junior Endeavors at their home
last Friday afternoon. Thirty-four
sweet little tots gathered there and
indulged in games, races and talks,
from 3 to 5 P. M. Then they were
treated to a large dish of fruit ice,
which they certainly enjoyed. Mrs.
George Stephenson and Misses May
me Holman and Mary Shepherd Mesl
ser assisted Mrs. Skiles in the enter
tainment. Those parents who fail
to send their little ones to this junior
work are certainly robbing their chil
dren of great advantages for Mrs.
Skiles and Mrs. Stephenson are ex
erting themselves to teach them ev
erything they can and things their
busy mothers don't take time to tell
them. In a few years these little
ones will know more about religion
than many grown-ups.

"Battle Royal"
Alleged To Have Enlivened Cay Wish
ing Party Down in Casey.
Middleburg, Sept. 1.
News comes from Hatter Creek of
a battle royal that is said to have
been fought there several days
since, two of the participants being
highly esteemed minor officials of the
county, of the small calibre order. It
seems, as reports go, that the bellig
rents had gone fishing and as is cus
tomary on an occasion of that kind
had taken along a sufficient quantity
of booze to be used in case of snake
bites. Things ran smoothly until
they got rough, and they got still
rougher till the air smelled of sul
phur, and stones and clubs were
brought into use. The battle occu
pied the space of pei-haps several
hours. When the smoke cleared-
the only visible results were a few
bloody noses and some bruises that
were of but little consequence. JNo
further trouble is anticipated, as
peace is said to have been declared
and the belligerents are in a posi
tion to go before the next grand jury
and declare that it was only a "sham
fight" and the officials mentioned
were playfully acting as umpires.

Thursday was estimated at 7,000 to

Danville to Somerset was crowded
when it left McKinney and by the
time it had taken on- crowds at King's
Mountain and Waynesburg, stand

did Lincoln county furnish her full
quota of people, but she sent down a

HEATH SEVERANCE A HERO
The part played by Heath Sever
ance, son of Mr. and Mrs. A. H. Sev
erance, of this city, in the attempted
rescue of the little Lewis baby who
was drowned at Crab Orchard early
last week, deserves more than pass
ing mention, and was inadvertently
overlooked in the chronicle of the
horrible affair at the time. After
the colored man had dragged the
body of the baby from the lake, into
the boat, he proved totally inefficient
and was unable to row toward the
shore. Realizing that every moment
was precious, if the child was to be
resuscitated, young Severance leap
ed into the water, tho attired in all
of his clothes, swam out to the boat
and climbing in, brought it to shore.
Dr. Strader and others worked with
the baby for an hour and a half in
an effort to bring back the spark of
life, but without avail. Young Sev
erance has been highly commended
by all who have learned of his 'quick
action in endeavoring to save the
life of the little one.
