SELMER. McNAIRY COUNTY. TENN.. FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER I, IQI6.
NUMBER 9
We notice from the Nashville
Banner that on Sept. 1st it will
discontinue exchanges with its
country cousins. They propose
to each subscribe for the other's
paper, but there is boot in the
exchange. They claim this is the
result of the high price of paper
and at the request of the Ameri
can newspaper publishers. We
are glad that the Banner is able
to get along without it country
cousins, and we will try to move
and have our being without its
presence on our desk.
Everybody from the railroad
employees to the bootblack seems
to have a mania for striking, for
a reason or for none, as the case
may be. Labor will have to learn
sometime that the tail never
wags the dog. Muscle has its
place and its value, but brains
and money never were controlled
by passion, prejudice and ignor
ance. There is not a striker in
the whole push that can earn as
much money at any other job.
If he could he would take it, and
would be doing right when he
did.
The submarine Deutchland has
made its round trip and landed
at its home port. It is a historic
achievement partaking more of
the spectacular than the practi
cal. The cargoes carried cannot
affect the needs of the Germans. ,
The few dye stuffs brought here
will go only a short way toward
lessening the wants of the textile
manufactures. It is claimed that
the Breman, which has long been
expected,' was caught in a steel
net before it reached the ocean.
However that may be will de
termine a second trip ever at
tempted by such a modern invention.
Death of Mrs. Mary Grier
After many montl)8 of suffering
baffling the skill of doctors, Sunday
jiight Mrs. Mary Grier, aged 53 years,
passed away. For a number of days
she was just at the brink. Her mal
ady, jaundice, had reduced her to a
skeleton, with that color so character
istic of the disease.
Mrs. Grier .was 'an extraordinary
woman. She was by nature a woman
of strong mentality and was outspoken
in her condemnation of wrong, and an
earnest advocate of the right. She
was not slow to speak by name the
unworthy, and give her praise to the
worthy; She was a most practical
and industrious woman, whose devo
tion to family and friends was we! I
known.- - .'
" , She leaves a husband, W. E. Grier,
and one son, Eber, of Selmer, and two
daughters, Mrs. W. R: Bair of Texas
and Mrs. Odus Perkins of, Selmer, be
sides several brothers and sisters.
She was laid to . rest in Oak Hill
cemetery. Short services were con-
ducted by H. P. Wood.
She was a member of the Christian
church and a devout Christian, pre
' ferring to do good to the living than
i shed tears over the dead.
v Singing at Sandy Flat
C. P. Mconey, editor of the Com
mercial Appeal, accompanied byThos.
Fauntelroy, staff correspondent, came
down Sunday morning, spending the
. day as the guest of VV. K. Abernathy
and wife. Through the courtesy of J
J. L.. Hendrix and wife of Bethel
Springs, who came down in their auto
mobile, the entire party spent the
morning at Sandy Flat, attending the
singing convention. An interesting
part of the day's program there, was I
an address by Mr. Mooney. "lie was
' called upon by the officers of the con
vention, and in a response of about
SO minutes, he captivated the audi
ence. The party took dinner at the fam
ous springs there, and in the after
noon Messrs. Mooney, Fauntleroy,
Hendrix and Abernathy drove - to
Shiloh National Park, where some
time was spent in going over these
beautiful grounds. They returned to
Selmer in the afternoon.
Mr. Mooney expressed himself as
highly pleased with his visit to Mc
Nairr county, and promised to return,
at an early date. .
The singing convention was. a howl
ing success. The place of next meet
ing, in November, is at Mt. Giliad.
John Swaim was re-elected presi
dent of the convention.
There was a very large crowd, and
a royal dinner spread from the many
baskets.
Burglary at Guys
' Constable D. L. Dixon, of Chewalla,
has again been successful in catching
burglars. About a month ago the
express office at Guys was robbed
and 32 pints of red liquor carried
away! Again Wednesday night of
last week, it was broken into. Dixon
arrested Joe Caldwell and Walter
Jones, who acknowledged the first
burglary. They accused Frank Wat
son as the one who furnished the
horse and buggy Jthey used. He de
nies the occurrence. Watson was
arrested at Corinth and gave bond.
The others are in jail. They all live
near Pea Ridge. Mr. Dixon has
shown himself in a number of cases,
almost successful officer, and a holy
terror to evildoers.
'Guthrie, Okla., Aug. 15, 16.
Now that we are having a little
rest from this blazing, burning West
ern sun, and can take a little breath
ing spell in a little cooler atmosphere.
I will give you my impressions of this
country, where I came wjth a sick
one, some months ago, seeking bene
fit from the change. This is the cen
tral part of the state, and Guthrie
was the capital till about 1908. when
it was moved toOklahamaCity, thirty
miles from here, over the Sante Fe
R. R. It is also connected with that
city by an interurban line, just com
pleted m July, at which time there
waS quite a celebration here, and
Guthrie did her very best to amuse
and entertain those who came, feed
ing over a thousand at dinner, giving
free tickets to the swimming pool at
the municipal bath house, of which
several hundred took advantage, out
side movies, and a free band concert.
Guthrie has to do things in this
manner, for she understands, what a
tremendous rival she has in Oklahoma
Citv, which has sprung np in this
n w country like a mushroom in the
night, and a nice, fine one at that; a
powerful one too, which does not
wilt, but keeps on growing, and i x
panding in ev?ry direction. r,It is by
far the largest town in the state. I
have not been there, but am told
there are many fine buildings, and a
number of splendid churches, which
would do credit to many older cities.
Guthrie is an unusually prettv
place, nicely laid off. with broad,
shady streets, and paved ,with brick
in the center of the streets as well as
on the sidewalks. The parking or
grass plots along the sides, gives one
the impression that a town has been
built in a park. There are several
mineral wells here.i rtuated in a
rather low place hre there is a
grove of very fine trees would not
be considered anything extra in Ten
nesfee and it is callei "Mineral
Wells Park," a cool, inviting spot in
thie prairie country, where you only
see scrub oak to vary the monotony.
Guthrie claims twelve thousand
people.
The old capitol has been turned
into a school building, and is a sore
spot to the eyes of Guthrie's people,
reminding them of the loss of the
court house. - It reminds one of past
days in McNairy, which, with all of
her trials in those days, is eyer dear
to those who are far away. I have
been told that in the earlv days here,
when the strip, about fifteen miles
from here, was opened, there were
trying times, aa vou had to keep a
gun by you day and night, aa some
one was putting in a claim for your
piece of ground, and firearms waa
the only defense vou had.
I never saw a .prettier picture than
was presented to my view a few
mornings eince,one L cannot f orgRt.
I went to my eastern window to ad
juHt the curtains, and happened to
glance at tne skj; ic was magnincem.
It was just the hour before dawn.
Such tints of pale blue, such touches
of delicate pink md the soft waving
gray of the heavens, and peeping out
amidst this was a large star seeming
ly composed of most glittering
diamonds, blazing with eheenrg
brightness over tho still darkened
world, an emblem of hope, and of the
day dawn.-

The Wise Saying of a v
Great Business Man
When you get a good customer strive to keep him, but
when you get a bad one strive to keep yourself. The Mc
Caskey System will help you to this end. The desirable cus
tomer will appreciate and is really entitled to an itemized
statement of Tiis account with each purchase. Th$ Mer
chant can furnish it to him with no extra cost or labor with
the McCaskey System. The undesirable customer don't
want to know, neither does h want his merchant to know
what he owes. The McCaskey System keeps both posted.
Take the wise saying of the great business man; keep
your good customer by furnishing him with an itemized state
ment of his account. Keep yourself from the clutches of
your bad customer by keeping yourself posted. 1 ,
