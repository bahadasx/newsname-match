WOMENS' PARTY
[I
V/ Party Now Ha» Power And
Leadership
Almost everything is important,
but most 'things to their true sea
son seasoned are.' That is, there
are times when one thing is more
important than another. Sometimes
it happens that one thing is for the
occasion more important than any
other, and it seems to the women
suffragists of the United States
that for the immediate present the
question of the enfranchisement of
women takes precedence of all else.
It is important in the first place be
cause a practicable plan has been
hit upon, namely, an amendment to
the United States Constitution re
moving the disability of sex as a
qualification for voting. If this
amendment is passed by Congress,
and ratified by three-fourths of the
states, it becomes binding upon all
the states, as is proper in a repub
lic where the majority rules. This
is by far the swiftest and simplest
process for attaining the end.
The question of the immediate
enfranchisement of women is su
premely important at the moment,
also, because for the first time in
history women have the power and
the leadership to enforce their de
mands. In twelve equal suffrage
states there are four mill ion women
voters—hitherto as sheep without a !
shepherd, but the organization of
the Women's Party and the insert
ion of a strong suffrage plank in the
platform of the four strongest poli
tical parties and demonstrations of
a leadership that counts.
present time, in the third place, be
cause of the continued admission to
citizenship of aliens, whose tradi-1
tions regarding women are not sim-j
ilar to our own. In six states—Ar
kansas, Deleware, Indiana, South
Dakota, Texas, West Virginia-aliens
may, after one year's residence in
the United States or within the
State, vote on amendments to the
state constitution if they have de
dared their intention of becoming a ;
citizen. Nebraska requires only six
months'residence. These compar-;
atively ignorant voters are in the
future to pass upon the question as
enfranchising highly bred, college
trained, American born, women of
property and social prominence—
and the number of such voters is
increasing. The call to all voting
women to stand shoulder to should
er, to put suffrage first and party
affiliations second in the coming
elections, is one that may not be
ÿghtly disregarded. The call to

His former home was at Yankton,
South Dakota, sixty miles from
Tripp, where he lived for fifteen
years. The country tributary to
Tripp is devoted to agriculture and
stock raising. Mr. and Mrs. Wenz

we have got used to it. It is just
the same as working in civil life
only a little more exciting and noisy.
Last night I went out for a ride on
my horse and while I was away a

It did very little damage but I think
he had his nerve, dont you?
Well Mac, I dont know how
much longer I will be over here but
it is a nice country and I am feeling
fine. Never felt better in my life. I
I have lost the hearing of one ear,

School to Open September 11
Pupils Should Begin Planning Their Work for the Ensuing
School Year
the comin g year
Have you thought about it? Are
you making your plans for a pleas
ant and profitable school year? Do
you know that the Kendrick schools
will open Monday, Sept. 11th, bare
ly one week hence?
The long summer vacation is
rapidly drawing to a close, all too
rapidly for many of us and the
time has arrived when the pupils
with the cooperation of the parents
should be planning their work for
This applies es
pecially to eighth grade graduates
and high school students in Kend
rick and adjacent districts who may
be considering the advisability of
continuing or discontinuing their
education at this time. Perhaps a
word or two of counsel and encour
agement will help them make a
wise choice at this critical period
in their careers.
All arguments to the contrary
the value of a high school education
can no longer be discounted. In
deed, the relative value of an edu
cation has undoubtedly increased
100 per cent in the past two decades
and the increase during the next
ten years will be even greater.
With only a slight expansion of our
imagination we can readily see how
true this is from a study of the
present situation.
Just now no one can foresee the
end of this, the greatest war of all
the ages.
The end may come next year or
it may be five years but this much
we can foresee, that just as surely
as the war has boosted prices and
employment in the United States
during its short existence, there is
bound to follow a period of great
economic and industrial depression.
The wastage in the war, both hu
man and material, has staggered
our imaginations and approaches
infinity. In view of these facts we
may well ask ourselves, can the
United States go on with its pre
paredness and prosperity without
contributing her share in the pay
ment to be demanded by all law,
natural, artificial, and divine, to
square accounts for the world's
folIy? Hardly ' The tlme has P assed
in the history of civilization when
one nation can profit by the calam
ity and destruction of others.
What then will be the result when
the war ends? Our customers,
most of them, ' will be bankrupt,
competition with goods made by
cheap European labor will be of
the cutthroat variety, and our for
eign markets will be closed. Labor
will be thrown out of employment,
wages will be lowered and no doubt
without any corresponding reduc
tion in the high cost of living. The
question here arises, how can we,
the men and women of to-morow,
best fortify ourselves against these
lean years from which there is no
escape? Undoubtedly the best way
out will be through education and
industrial training. Efficiency ex
perts are telling us that the time is
not far distant when the working
man without education or techinal
training will find the avenues of
employment closed.
What is meant by education and
technical training? Certainly no
one can be classed as educated until
he has graduated from the high
Smut Causes A Loss
Genesee, Aug. 29.—The presence
of an unusual amount of smut in
the Genesee grain district has re
gulted alrea( f in damage to one
jmac hine, while wheat destroyed in
sacks within reach of the fire was
valued at $400. The machine is
at work on the A B c * lark farm
located about eight miles west of
Genesee.
school or its equivalent while all
the foremost technical (trade)
schools in this country and Ger
many consider such training as
merely preparatory or the minimum
which every student should have be
fore entrance and of course it is
conceded that a young man or
woman must spend four, six, eight
or more years beyond the high
school before they are thoroughly
equipped for a professional career.
The old argument that a high school
education is a luxury because it
fails to teach the "bread and but
ter" sciences, has no foundation
any longer as far as the modern
high school course is concerned. To
meet this very argument, the Kend
rick Board of Education and super
intendent are endeavoring to make
the high school courses practical
and, as fast as funds will permit,
introduce vocational subjects. Al
ready, a laboratory has been equip
ped at a cost of several hundred
dollars for the purpose of practical
instruction in general science, agri
cultural botany, physics, and this
year they expect to offer training
in studies of agriculture and com
mercial chemistry. Even such a
subject as geometry classed by the
ancients as logic and until quite re
cently a theoretical science has been j
so completely revolutionized that it
may now be classed as vocational.
In fact the new text book to be used
in the Kendrick high school con
tains some 300 problems pertaining
to architecture, engineering, sur
veying, etc. Other work for the
boys this year will be a class in
manual training under the super
vision of Mr. Ross Chappel. This
course will not be offered for credit
at present but will be open to all
boys desiring a knowledge in the
fundamentals of carpentry and cab
inet-making. Lack of space for
bids the discussion of other new
features in the Kendrick schools
which are being planned for the
coming year. Suffice it to say that
Kendrick can now boast of the lar
gest and best equipped high school
between Moscow and Lewiston.
Mr. or Mrs. Parent, what do you
think about it? Mr. and Miss
Eighth Grade Graduate, what are
you going to do about it?
Attention is called to the impor
tant matter of the pupil entering
school on the first day. Several
students of the high school in the
past year lost their credits for no
other reason than that they were
absent from school at the beginning
or at other times during the term.
An early beginning is better than
a late one, a late beginning is only
better than none at all. Pupils in
the grades are expected and requir
ed by the law to be in attendance
from the first day on unless released
by the truant officer becauss they
are sick or needed for support
their family.
The superintendent will be glad
to assist boys and girls from the
country in finding desirable places
where they may work for their
board and lodging while attending
school. Any parties in town who
may have such work either for girls
or bovs are requested to phone Mr.
Best.
Two Separators Burned
Both of Perry Baker's separators
were destroyed from smut explo
sions on the Potlatch this week.
The first fire occurred Tuesday and
entirely destroyed the machine. An
old separator was then put into
service the next day and it burned
up Wednesday. S. Douglas who was
separator tender, was painfully
burned about the hands and face in
the second fire.
Phyllis Cain Wins Prize
j
The friends of Miss Phyllis Cain
of American ridge will be pleased
to know that her essay entitled,
"Our National Government and Its
Sale of Intoxicants," won first
place in the state contest. The
prize was $15. which she received a
few davs ago. Her paper, with the
best from all other states will be 1
sent to Washington D. C. where it
will compete for a national prize.
The three winning essays are to be
judged in an international contest.
Kendrick may well be proud of
her success, for not only high school
students were included in the con
test, but also those of colleges and
normals all over the state. Here's
congratulations to Miss Phyllis.
Latah Fair Parade
The Latah County Fair will hold
a big parade on the opening date
of the fair. Neighboring towns
are to be given places of honor for
floats and industrial displays. Even
the politicians are to have a place (
in the line. The democratic sec
tion will be headed by a float drawn
by six mules and the republicans
will probably be headed by an ele
phant team. All local candidates
will follow in their respective band
wagons. At least 200 automobiles
are expected to join the parade and
many other attractions will be
shown.
Explosion From Smut
A smuf explosion occurred Mon
day afternoon on the Phil Elvy
place near Juliaetta. The machine,
owned by Carlton & Heimgartner,
was damaged very little. W. W.
McAllister was badtly burned
about the hands and face and
George Miller who was standing
about ten feet from the machine,
sustained slight injuries. Five of
the horses at work near the sépara
tor suffered from the flames and
about 100 sacks of wheat were
burned.
Sister Mary Rose of the Benedic- t *
tine Order and for several years a ca
teacher in the high school at Colton, ^
was instantly killed Monday when
an automobile driven by William
Herdiman of Genesee went over the c
grade on the mountain above Waha.
Sister Patricia received severe cuts
and a badly sprained back, Sister
Augustine was badly bruised and

NEAR GENESEE
Pole—MacPherson Hurt
Ca r Slid Against Telephone
wben
Harvey Roberts had quite a
smash-up with his car Sunday while
driving from Genesee to Moscow.
He had five people in the car with
him when the accident happened
and O. E. MacPherson was the only
one hurt. MacPherson was thrown
from the car and it is thought,
struck his head against a post, cut
ting rather a severe scalp wound
and rendering him unconscious for
several hours.
No one seems to know exactly
how the accident occurred. The road
was level and smooth and the occu
pants of the car state that they
were not traveling over 15 or 20
miles an hour when the accident
happened. They started to turn
out of the road for another car
which was coming at a distance,
it is said, the front wheel
jjr aV e way throwing the car against
a telephone pole. The side of the
carW as badly smashed and the tele
p bo ne pole was broken to pieces
bu t the occupants of the car, with
t he exception of Mr. MacPherson
esca p ed with only slight bruises,
The car looked like a com p lete
wre ck but it was hauled to a gar
age in Moscow Monday and Wed
nesday morning Harvey drove it to
Kendrick. It looks as good as new
and is apparently none the worse
trom the smash-up.
The names of those who were in
the party are: Leona Joslin, Edith
Compton, Alphia Pierson, O. E.
MacPherson, Percy McKenzie and
Harvey Roberts.

Elevator at Uniontown
Farmers of the Uniontown sec
tion will evade the sack nuisance
and this year a large majority plan
to market their grain in bulk. The
Uniontown cooperative association,
operating at Uniontown and Leon,
are just completing two grain ele
vators to handle this year's grain
crop, the elevator at Uniontown
having a capacity of one hundred
thousand bushels and the elevators
at Leon having a capacity of sixty
thousand bushels. The Washington
Water Power company has a crew
of men engaged at this time in
wiring both elevators to furnish
power and light. A grain elevator
is being constructed at Johnson,
Wn., also, and the power company
is now extending its line to that
point so as to serve that elevator,
Genesee already has an elevator.—
