To the Lady of the House
$$$ Dear Madam $
We wish to call your attention to a little specia
which we will run for
3 0 DAYS ONLY
' ral jrzs-
Always "on the Job"
The right kind of clothes at
the right prices are almost
enough to sell themselves But
there's another factor the per
sonal element
Lots of people come here
to buy because they're sure of
going away with a smile And
a customer's smile is worth as
much to us as our profit on the
goods he buys. The satisfied
person comes back
The size of a purchase is only
an item. We figure that a ten
cent sale and a pleased customer
are more valuable in the long run
than a ten dollar sale and a "never
come
bacl
c
it
I
Make us prove our willing
ness to serve Our stocks are
especially attractive right now

be hoped that it can be avoided.

talk with him, not that he would
be benefitted but we are the one
that would be t'leflfortuhate one.
