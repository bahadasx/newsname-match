the trouble.

BAPTISTS
CONCLUDE
LABORS
j Next Meeting of Chickasaw Baptist Asso
ciation Will Be Held at Minco;
Features of Convention
Alter one of the most interesting
and profitable sessions In its existence
the Chickasaw Baptist association con
cluded its twenty-fourth annual meet
ihg last night ami most of the mes
sengers accredited to it have returned
to their homes in Grady county. Twenty-three
churches were represented
this year and about 150 messengers
and visitors were in attendance.
The convention opened with the an
nual sermon preached at the First
Baptist church by Rev. G. II. Herring
ton, pastor at Minco. At the conclu
sion of the sermon Dr. Jent, a mem
ber of the faculty of the Baptist Uni
versity at Shawnee, delivered a stere
opticon address picturing the build
ing, grounds and faculty and giving a
short history of the IWes and educa
t'.'Mial ntfaimiwnts of the teachers.
Dr. Wray, local pastor, then busied
himself finding homes for the messen
gers during their stay in the city.
Rev. H. P. Haley was re-elected
moderator T. J. Brown of Tuttle, vice
moderator, DeWitt Sankey of Tuttle,
clerk, and "Hie old reliable" D. A.
Short, treasurer for the ensuing year.
On the first day of the meeting J.
C. Stallcup brought encouraging news
concerning the Baptists Orphan Home
i:r Oklahoma City. The Christian ed
ucation campaign, state missions, rou
tine and other matters took up the en
tire il.i'', Eij-Jt'non reports wre r.
ceivod including those on temperance.
Christian education, Sunday schools,
B. Y. P. U., home and foreign missions
and ministerial churches. Numerous
interesting remarks accompanied
some of these reports.
Educational features constituted the
leading talks of the two days. Pro
gress along these lines was reported
on all sides. Great interest also cen
tered on the report of the State Bap
tists Orphan's Home at Oklahoma
City which has now an indebtedness
of only $1000 compared with $17,000 u
year ago. The entire running ex
penses during the year were contrib
uted by the Baptist Sunday schools
throughout the state,' which gave an
entire month's collections for this
purpose. The home has now ."9 in-
mates but. a movement is on foot to
enlarge the institution in order that
200 or 30o children may be accommo
dated within the next two or three
years.
The meeting next year will be held
at Minco and the church at that place
extended to all a very cordial invita
tion to be present.
In addressing the association on
Sunday schools Judge R. E. Daven
port in part, said:
"The first thing in considering the
question of Sunday schools is. what
do the Sunday schools amount to?
The statistics show that of all conver
sions of the church three-fourths to
seven eighths come out of the Sunday
school. These are young people whose
lives are in front of thm and as long
as it means more to lead a hoy to
Christ than it does a man so long will
the Sunday school be on the map.
Thu crying need of the. Sunday
school today is competent teachers.
The great trouble in many Sunday
schools is to get teachers enough,
The three requisites for competent
teachers are grace, grit and gumption.
They must have grace, regardless of
their other qualifications. They need
the grit and determination to make
a thorough preparation of the lesson
and to be in attendance and on time
at Sunday s hoot. The teacher who is
habitually late is a failure. They will
find that by being late they have lost
an opportunity to secure the atten
tion of the class and do a first class
job of teaching their lessons. By
gumption is meant that the teacher
must have the tact to handle the ques-
tions whiih come up in the class
rooms. Order is necessary but the
force order like th teacher in the day
1 school. When the term tact is men-
tijued Home people think that deceit

Is meant. But tact and deceit are in
no ways synonymous. The person
who will go out in the streets during
any week and say to all the. people
they meet just what they happen to
think will be liable tp have a pistol
encounter before the week is over.
"The pastor of the church is also
the pastor of the Sunday school.
Christ came into the world to estab
lish a church, not a Sunday school,
The Sunday school is the teaching ser
vice of the church and the pastor is
responsible for what is taught in the
Sunday school. When the teacher's
idea clashes with that of the pastor,
the pastor has the right to contol."

Files in August Cover Expenses of Run-
HH2 Department and Furnish
$150 Surplus " ,
"Tlie receipts of t!w police court
last month met all the expenses of
running the department and gave a
profit of $1.10," said Mayor Coffnian
today after turning in $i;i::.,'!0 to the
city treasurer and getting his receipt
for that sum. "The employment of
Sammy Dwyer as uiotorcvcle cop
proved to be a good investment finan
cially for while earning about $10 for
less than half a mouth's service lie
brought in fines amounting to $110.
"I do not believe he will add that
much to police court receipts during
September for jay riding and speed
ing offenses," added the mayor, "for
these violations of law are rapidly de
creasing. But after the fifteenth of
the month Dwyer may be kept busy
detaining owners who have neglected
to dim their lights or to provide fail
lights as required by the new ordi
nance which goes into effect on that
date."
