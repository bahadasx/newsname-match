ESTABLISHED 1845.
AUTO SPEEDERS
ARE INDICTED
Charges Also Against Parties
For Running Car While Un?
der Influence of Whiskey.
Few Didn't Have License.
The Grand Jury, which met Mon?
day und adjourned Tuesday found a
number of indictments, which ought
to convince automobile owners and
drivers that the lives of the people
are to be safeguarded, und that the
public highways belong to all the
people, and the people have the right
to the safe use of the highways, free
from dangers incident to reckless
speeding by half-drunk or whole
drunk drivers.
The Grand Jury found some six 01
seven indictments against speeders,
some of these on two charges?one
for speeding and one for driving
while under the influence of liquor.
One young man,, who lives in the
county, and who had been burning
up the streets in this town and the
roads round about, was hauled up be?
fore Judge Patton and lined $50.00
and costs, amounting to $56.00 in
all. It was shown, so witnesses staled,
that he was smartly intoxicated, and
he may thank Providence that his
recklessness did not cost him his life
and the lives of others with him. In
addition to the fine a bond of $500
was required by the magistrate, for
12 months.
Another Tazewell young man, in?
dicted for speeding while drunk, is
said to have gone on a visit to an?
other state, and there nre others. This
action of the authorities is timely, and
just what was to have been expected.
These, and all other motor-men, have
had sufficient warning from the pn
Ecrs and otherwise, that trouble would
o the result of reckless driving, but
they failed to heed. These young men
lire usually quiet, good boys, but the
evidence showed that John Barley?
corn was the chauffeur at the wheel,'
and not the boys, and everybody |
knows that Chauffeur "John" Is a j
reckless, heedless driver. The fines !
imposed will go into the public treas?
ury of the county as a credit, and the
young men will charge up the amounts
to "incidental expenses."
And it Is to be hoped that this will
he a lesson heeded by all drivers of
cars. The commonwealth's attorney,
and other authorities, have set their
heads, they say, and are determined
that the laws shall, be obeyed, and the
rights of the public guarded.
Only One Pocahonlns Case.
Ferhnps this was the first Grand
Jury for years that did not have a
number of cases before it for investi?
gation, from Poeahontas. There was
only one case?that of a colored man,
charged with assaulting his wife with
a knife. A true bill was returned. And
? this seems to mean, says a Grund Ju?
ror, that a quietus has been put on
things in Poeahontas. Think of it!
Not a single case before a Tazewell
court from the police courts of Poea?
hontas! Surely a better day is dawn?
ing!
Devilment Due to Liquor.
One man, in commenting on this
state of affairs, said thnt Poeahontas
people were no worse than the people
of any other town, nor any better.
They are just plain human beings like
the rest of us. For years, he said, they
have showed up seemingly worse than
most folks, but it was not because
they were worse or more depraved
naturally, but their had showing was
due to their surroundings. He went on
to say thnt no people on earth have
shown up in a better light perhaps,
under similar surroundings. With the
town honey-combed with bar-rooms
nnd low dives and their attendants
and the devil busy twenty-four hours
every day, including Sunday., the year
round, how in the world could people
be decent? But now, he declared, with
all that hell and hellery subsiding,
the city of Poeahontas is taking her
place among the quiet and peaceful
cities of the commonwealth, and after
November 1st., and with several of
the chief offenders in jail, conditions
will be better still, and homes will be
happier.
The members of the Grand Jury at
this term of the court were:
G. W. Donk, Foreman; M. J. Hank
ins, H. S. Bowen, W. J. McNeil, Hi?
ram Stowers, James Harris, J. C.
j<Pruett, W. H. linger, Joseph Harris

Maxwell motor cars have

front and rear wheels.
F.OPJ". DETROIT
REMEMBER these important features, because
they are not to be found on some of the lighter cars.
Maxwell cars have 3 ^ in. tires all around This is a
generous size. The tires are not overtaxed. They last
longer and make riding easier.
Tires of one size mean that you have to carry only
one size casing and one size tube.
Demountable rims, of course, are recognized as the
best They are on all good cars. Don't buy any car
without demountable rims. If you do, you'll regret it
These two features?along with the other complete

endurance of the Maxwell, make it the greatest auto?
