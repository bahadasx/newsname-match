Spring approached, and I was out
very early of mornings, when I be
came interested in twd dairy wagons
"Rivals, as sure as fate,-" I thought.
One was Farmer Brown's wagou
the other, Farmer Jones'.
As the days passed J could notice
that when Brown would make an Im
provement In his milk cans, wagon or
harness, Jones would, the very next
morning, have as good or better.
I saw here a contest to the finlsb.
between Drown and Jones that ap
pealed to me very much, being my Be It

Brown, as he was the older man, and
he furnished milk to the family where
I roomed.
Warm days having arrived, I con
cluded to go fishing, and on a particu
lar Saturday 1 started for the river.
a few miles from town. On the way
out I hear 4 wagon approaching fromv'
the rear. Looking; back, 1 recognized
the red top of Brown's milk wagon,
and aa I stepped aside to let him pas
was hailed with- these words:
"Young feller, If you git lank under
the Jacket, why jist sa'nter over thar
W that white house an' I'll feed you.'
About noon I concluded 1 would
"sa'nter ovef fciwl share Brown's ex
tended hospitality.
"I knowed you'd come 'boat feedia
time. Come in and have a cheer.
Ketch anything?"
"Not a thing." I replied, "and I con
ClwJoil 1 would rather visit with, you
than to
After a jjoOd dinner, Brown said:
"Young feller, now I want you to
tell me how I can dowu Jones."
"Well, Mr.- Browii, I haTe often
thought,, when your wagon would rat
He and your horse' hoofs would
pound the paved street, that If a
scheme could be devised by which,
this noise would not waken your cus
tomers at such an eavly hour it would
be a winner."
Bure enough, next morning but onet
Brown drove down the stroet with liia
horses shod with coffee sacks.
A week later Jones appeared with,
his horses all shod with rubber.
Soon they both had equipped them
selves pretty well with rubber appa
ratus of various kinds. Brown having
bought rubber tires for his wagon.
It began to look as it Jones was
down, when, one afternoon, Browa
rushed into my room exclaiming:
"This time I am beat. Jones has
an automobile."
After dinner I walked up to the
"corner grocery," whose owner,ya Mr:
Johnson, and I were good friends.
I found Johnson back in the ware
room changing the water on some
minnows he had in a tank. I saw
two milk cans, and learned they
belonged to Farmer Jones.
On Tuesday morning I told Brown
to meet me at Johnson's store at tea
o'clock.
On arriving there I pointed out hie
competitor's cans.
"Now, listen," said I, "in those can
will be found a little milk and we
will pour In as much water. In yon
der tank are some minnows; we will
get some of them and drop in one of
those cane, and then we'll have Jonea
tell us how they got there."
Jones came in and started back for
his cans, when Johnson said:
"Say, all you fellows, come baclc
here with Jones and me. I want to
show you something."
Of course, we all went. Johnson
said:
"Now, Jones, you have alwaya
worn to me, and to all your custom
ers, that you never watered any milk.
How did these minnows get into this
can!"
"Fur Lord's sake, men!" exclaimed
Jones. "I'll confess. I was in a hurry
this mornln' and didn't git all Vhe
niilldu' done, and as I crossed the
crick I reached down and scooped
up a couple of huckctfuls uf water
and and poured It into this can!"
