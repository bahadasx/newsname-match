WHO'S A
LIAR?
In a Seattle paper Monday, N'ovfm

SOMEBODY LIED
Because the record* show thi«: On October 12,
and o« August 21. 1911. Humphrey wrote let
ters to the treasury department regarding the post
office site, in one letter -aying. "The price asked wm
reasonable "
a debate in congress. July 13. 101 ft.
Humphrey said: "On August 12,
1911, I wrote my first letter in rela
tion to this matter (meaning the
duck-pond site)."
• • • • •
SOMEBODY IS A LIAR
Bccause the records show that Humphrey wrote
the treasury department concerning the duck-pond
*ite on October 12. nearly ,i year before the
time he said he wrote his first letter This letier of
October 12, 1910. was marked "confidential."
In another Seattle paper. Tuesday,
November 9, 1015, Humphrey said,
"I have nothing to do with the >ite,
neither at present nor have I ever
had anything to do with it in the pa-t The whole
thing i meaning the charge about the postoffice site
swindle* has been manufactured."
• • • • •
THIS WAS A LIE
P>ecau-e he admitted in congress on June 13. 1916,
that he did write a letter concerning the site on
August 12, 1911, and the records show that he wrote
a letter on August 21. I'M 1 and another letter the
vear before. October 12, 1010. all regarding the post
office site and in one of these letters urging its
purchase and saying the price wa- reasonable.
The PI. quoting Humphrey's
>rrc h ma'le ;ii i'.ri m<-rt' ii W ednes
say*. August 12, 1911/ Sen
Poindexter also wrote to the depart
ment asking about the status of this site, getting
into the duck-pond by that act mx months prior to
the date of any correspondence had by Mr. Hum
phrey with regard to it.
• * • • •
THIS IS A LIE
Because the records -how that Humphrey wrote
a letter to the treasury department on October 12,
1910, 10 months previous to the time at which he
said Poindexter wrote a letter asking for facts about
the mess.

s THE ONLY PAPER IN SEATTLE THAT DARES TO PRINT THE NEWS :
VOLUME 19.
STAR ACCEPTS
HIS MEN; NOW
ITS HIS MOVE
Federal Judge Cushman and Superior
Judges Ronald and Frater are to hear the
charges against Will E. Humphrey.
These judges named by Humphrey last
night are acceptable to The Star and since
there is no need of more than three members
to hold the investigation. The Star with
draws the names of its proposed judges and
is willing to rest the case with the three se
lected by Humphrey.
Humphrey in his speech last night also
declared that he wanted all of the charges
that have been made against him laid before
this committee.
HEARINGS MUST BE OPEN
The Star accepts this challenge willing'
ly. The Star accept* all of the terms and
all of the conditions laid down by Hum*
phrey. The only thing that The Star insists
upon is that the hearing be held in public,
that the testimony in full be given to the pub
lic and that Humphrey put up his $1,000
forfeit in advance.
All Humphrey needs to do now to get
the investigation under way is to name the
time and the place at which it is to be held.
If Humphrey wants to go back into the old
mileage-graft charges, The Star will be
ready.
The Star's case against Humphrey will
be very brief, and it will be entirely of a doc
umentary nature. The Star will introduce
the congressional records showing that
Humphrey voted for the mileage graft by
which he was to draw $1,200 for making a
trip which he never made.
The letters that Humphrey wrote to the
treasury department in connection with the
postoffice site, particularly the one in which
he urged that the deal be put thru without
delay and the one in which he said that the
price asked was reasonable, will be prac
tically all of The Star's evidence in the
duck-pond case.
Since The Star has accepted all of Hum
phrey's judges and is willing to accept his
terms and is willing to let him name the
time and the place for the investigation, it
is now Humphrey's move. The one condi
tion which The Star insists upon is that the
hearing be held in public, that Humphrey
put up his $1,000 forfeit and that he posi
tively agree to withdraw from the race
when the charges are proven before the in
i vestigation board.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 1,
—President Wilson may re
ceive notification that Mon
day's scheduled national rail
road strike has been ordered
called off simultaneously
with the formal notification
tomorrow at Shadow Lawn
of his renomination for the
presidency.
The senate plans to ruata
the eight-hour bill thru be
fore it adjourns tonight.
Sen. Newlands introduced
the senate bill at 2 p. m.
Actual legislation intended
to prevent the railroad strike
was put under way shortly
after noon today, when the
house adopted a special rule
under which, at 4:30 this aft
ernoon, it is proposed to pan
the Adamson eight-hour bill,
All »rra"ngemerfti"Vbr »"rflgKt
MMion were completed this
afternoon. Senate leader* said
they would remain In session
even after midnight to get a
vote. They said the bill which
the *enate will put thru will be
the eame a* the Adamson
(houae) bill,
"The bill will go thru the *en.
ate tonight," *ald Senator New.
land*, chairman of tha Inter
state commerce committee In
charge of It.
The statement of senate re
publican leaders this afternoon
that they wilt not seek to ob
struct the legislation increased
confidence of the adminlstra
tion in the belief that the
strike crisis is as good ae
The rule was not adopted with
out objection, but the democrat ma
jority held the debate to one hour.
The house debate on the Adam
son bill l>»gan almost simultan
eously with introduction Into th«
senate of the similar senate Inter
state commerce commission bill for
an eight hour law.
This had been perfected during
a recess granted to permit a re
publican conference.
Cheer G. O. P. Members
Republican Representatives
root and Cooper. Wis., announced
they would vote not only for the
special rule, but for the Adamson
bill.
"I dislike the attitude of haste,"
Raid Cooper, "but I object to tha
charge by Representative Bennett,
New York, that the railroad men
are forcing the legislation 'with a
gun against the head of congress.'
The railroad employes did not bring
this case to congress. They are not
trying to hold up congress.
Brotherhoods Law Abiding
"The president brought this case
here. There is no more law abiding
body of in n In the world than
members of the four great brother
hoods.'"
l.enroot joined Cooper in declar
ing the president Is "responsible
for the present crisis "
' The president told nt Tuesday
this crisis had been threatening
the nation's life for a year. Why
did not he, and why did not you
democrats do something before this
if he and you knew of the impend
ing calamity? No one believe*
this is really an eight-hour law. It
is merely legislating the employea
an Increase In pay."
"Shotgun Procedure"
"Shotgun procedure" is what Rep
resentative Dennett called the ac
tion of the brotherhood leaders In
saying only an eight-hour law can
prevent the Mrike Monday.
Republican Senate Leader Gal
llnger said:
"There will he no obstructiv#
tactics. The bill prohahly will b*
passed by tomorrow night."
