J ConingsbU's
Last Minute
Bu FRANK FILSON
(Copyrigult, 1916, by W. G. Chapman.)
"Hurt you? Not a bit. You won't
feel anything."
The ghastly irony of the words rang
through ('oningsby's brain. True, he
would feel nothing, but it was not the
physical pain he feared. It was the
instantaneous flight of the soul, the
terror of nothingness when the electric
current sped through his nerves and
strained and stiffened muscles taut
against the straps. What did he care
for physical pain?
And the crime, the trial, the sen
tence to death, the long wait in the
deathhouse had almost vanished from
his mind, so long ago they seemed.
It was as if a different man had com
mitted that act of murder on an im
pulse for which this man, named Con
ingsby, dragged out the last few min
utes of his life.
He had been a business man, not
imaginative, not abnormal, an ordinary
citizen in every way before the event
occurred which was to transform him
Into a criminal. He had loved Polly
sincerely, and had thought her de
vota to him. Even now he winced
as IFremembered the shock of the
discovery that she loved another.
Then a red mist had risen before his
eyes, and he had killed-killed the
man whose name he searched for now
In vain, for the numbing sense of
death was already stealing through
him.
And he wondered idly wlether man
really has an immortal part, destined
to survive the tribulations of life and
look back on them with memory in
tact. Could there be heaven, if the
Ã½' Sr
II
"It Didn't Hurt You, Did It?"
complete memory remained? But, on
the other hand, was not memory it
self the test of survival?
Then there had been the flight after
,he murder. He could remember hard
ly anything of that, either, for it was
one long nightmare of railroad jour
neys. How had he eluded the police
who were posted, awaiting him, at ev
ery barrier? Oh, yes, the disguise!
He had forgotten that, as he seemed to
have forgotten everything.
Then had followed the dramatic be
trayal by his dentist, Polson. Polson
had fitted a gold tooth of a peculiar
shape In the upper jaw. It was Poison
who discovered him, by one of those
coincildences that seem always to lie
in wait for the criminal. Poison had
betrayed him to the police. It had
seemed the acme of irony that he
should have to lose his life because of
the chance recognition of a man whom
he saw only twice a year-and a den
tist!
He remembered the trial, with all
its abominable publicity. He had
hoped to escape with nominal sen
tence, but he refused his lawyer's sug
gestlon that he should plead the un
written law. His wife had been pres
ent in court. He remembered her cry
when the judge finished summing up.
Then the sthny faces of the jury
men, who stared at him as they filed
out of their box. And the terrible
waiting.
"If they're out an hour longer it will
mean a disagreement, or, at best, a
second-degree verdict," his counsel
whispered hopefully.
That was the first time that Con
ingsby realized the immlinence of
death A second-degree verdict! Why,
what had people been counting on?
Suddenly he became aware that the
faces of the spectators had death in
them. There was death in the silence
of the court, in the faces of the p
lice. In the averted looks of the jurors
as they came ominously back.
"Guilty of murder in the first de
gree!" Those words rang through his
brain. They seemed engraved there
Indelibly.
"Take it easily!" the prison superin
tendent was saying. And Coningsby
realized that, while these memories
had flitted through his brain, he had
actually traversed those few paces
across the stone flags from his cell
Into the death chamber.
That wan where he had exrpected his
nerve to fall. The prison superintend.
ent put some sweet-smelling and slight.
ly pungent stuff to his nostrils, but he
tried to push it away. He did not
want to go to his death drugged.
They were waiting for him, the re
porters and all the ghoulish crew.
There was the doctoo fingering his
stethoscope in an embarrassed man
ner, ready to apply it over his breast
after he had ceased to breathe. And
the electrician, pretending to be ab
sorbed in his own ghastly preparations
for sending down the lever which
should force thousands of volts of elec
tricity through his quivering body.
Coningsby looked at the reporters.
Their faces, singularly blank, stared
impassively into his. He saw a young
man moistening his dry lips furtively.
He was already in the chair! He
had sat down, still absorbed in his
thoughts. Now it was all but over.
The chaplain, at his side, would soon
begin intoning the burial service. He
knew just when the lever would fall.
"In the midst of life we are in death!"
No word was spoken, but Coningsby
knew that the dreadful drama had al
ready begun. The electrodes were al
ready applied. He felt the straps
about him. He gripped the chair with
both his hands. He felt his eyeballs
throbbing. He heard the droning of
the clergyman beside him.
He stared out under the bandages
about his eyes. He saw the line of
ghastly faces opposite him. The little
reporter was wiping his forehead.
Somebody pressed down the bandage
again, but not before he had seen
Polly's face among those of the as
sembled witnesses.
His blood ran sluggishly and icy
needles seemed to prick his veins.
Polly had come to see him die! The
thought was maddening. His eyes had
caught hers and he had seen hers
fixed on his with emotion, almost with
fear.
He tore the bandage from his eyes
and struggled in the chair. He drew
in a deep breath. The guards placed
their hands on him and forced him
down. He knew that the fatal cur
rent would not be sent through his
body while their hands were about
him. And, clinging to them, he strove
to raise, while the droning went on be
hind him.
"In the midst-"
He fought like a madman. The
scene dissolved in a red mist like that
which had been before his eyes when
he committed murder. All the while
he saw Polly's face, the horror in her
eyes. She started up.
"Of life-"
"Take it easily now. It won't last a
moment!"
He cursed the warden. He fought
like a man possessed. Polly had risen
and was coming toward him.
"We are in death!"
He felt the current course through
his body. He ceased to struggle. His
last thought was that it was too late. I
"It didn't hurt you, did it?"
He was staring into Poison's face.
The dentist was standing over him,
his forceps in his hand, and, at his
side, was Polly.
"You nearly got my finger that last
pull," said PoIson.
CARE IN NAMING THE BABY'
Something "Sweet" May Be III-Fit
ting When the Youngster
Grows Up.
Grown-up folk are sensitive about
their Christian or given names. More
especially so, if the name happens to
be a "fancy" one or one of austere
plainness.
We know a man whose name is Eli.
He hates it.
We know a young couple who called
their first-born Job. (They have a
rich relative who glories in the same
name.)
We know a middle-aged fat woman
who writhes under the name of Tiny.
(Really, can you beat it?)
When you name the baby, remem.
ber that the name is going to stick for
a lifetime.
Don't call your baby anything
"sweet," because your baby will grow
up to be a big, rugged man or a regu
lar life-sized woman.
Hypocrites in Society.
It amuses one to see people using
the mantle of charity not to cover the
destitute, not to hide a good deed, but
to conceal a creeping intrusion into
the houses of the great and the pene
tralia of fashionable society, which i
the only sort of society rich idlers rec
ognize. No doubt many philanthrople
movements are aware of those who'
are in thlem for the sake of the meet
ings held in great houses, which give
to those who attend a pleasing sense
of proximity to fabulous luxury. If
people hawv their hands full of Impor
tant business which they cannot drop,
this ceaseless struggle to stand up
and be counted among those present
appears small, undignified, unworthy
of human beings with work to do and
a soul to save that is of more value
than many macaroons and cups of tea.

SINGLE BLESSEDNESS.
I never wrote for money, I have no wish
for fame.
But the thought it was my duty stirred
my heart to flame.
I've longed to put my dreams in songs,
like the wild bird on the bough,
Just as I felt the soulful song an4. r,
taught me how.
The free bird sings where none can hear
but the silent, sighing trees.
Where it can never touch the ear, but
dies upon the breeze.
"Should young girls be encouraged to
believe marriage to be the godl toward
which their ambi
tions and hopes
should be
aimed?" A letter
from an earnest
aged, single min
ister of the gos
pel came to me
on a bright May
morning, a year
ago, making this
inquiry.
The same mail
brought me
among more than
a hundred others
-three letters
from widely dif
ferent points
which had a di
rect bearing upon
his query. One was from a young girl
of eighteen, a slave in a sweatshop in
New York. She wrote in part: "God
bless you for giving me the hope that
some day I may meet one who will
care for me enough to ask me to
marry. It is the one bright jewel of
hope that makes my life of toil endur
able."
Another wrote: "If I could write
for the papers as you do, I would tell
girls that they can live very happy
lives without so much as a thought
wasted on a man and marriage. I am
young, single and happy, independent
of mere man in the pursuit of what
shall give me life contentment and
shall continue to remain so. Advise
girls against love and matrimony."
The third was apparently written
by a shbaki nlhand. The writer con
feasl-sf o5.Uy 4rs, signing her
self "A Spinster.' She wrote in part:
"I have just been reading one of your
articles on love and marriage and it
has brought tears to my eyes. It is so
true-every word of it. When I was a
young girl I was told that it showed
weakness of character to think of hav
ing a beau and that no woman should
marry until she was well in her thir
ties-in short, of an age capable of
judging men accurately as to their
qualifications for marriage or their un
fitness. I crushed the natural impulses
of youth to encourage the would-be
lovers who sought my society and
turned my attention to duty. I was
praised for this by my kinsfolk, called
sensible and independent. I arrived at
the age of thirty. The youths who had
sighed for me in my youthful days
were all wedded, had happy homes,
contented wives and joyous children. I
realized the truth. Youth time is love's
own time and the time for mating. .It
is a grievous mistake in most cases
to delay it. Ten years more passed
and still another ten. The theory that
single blessedness is a happy existence
is all wrong."
That my articlen on heart topics
should be wise and worthy, I caused
letters to young girls, single women
just past the first bloom of womanhood
and elderly spinsters, mothers' and
widows, to be sent out asking their
experience and views on the subject
as to whether or not young girls
should be encouraged to believe mar
riage to be the goal toward which their
ambition and hopes should be aimed.
In every instance a reply, direct from
the heart was received. It was a stu
pendous but interesting task-reading
these letters, separating the wheat
from the husks.
Every' phase of love has been laid
bare before me. The unanimous ver
dict was that girls should be told that
marriage is the probable outcome of
their existence, a natural result-when
the right man is met, which will be an
honorable man, one who holds youth
and virtue sacred-in truth, the
rose bloom which Jewels her ex
istence. It is also held by this
vast majority of writers that great
good is accomplished in pointing
out to unsophisticated young girls
where the pitfalls lie in love's
paths and the stumbling blocks. There
are danger signals to hesitating, weak
natures that might love unwisely and
too well. To sum up the matter, girls
should always connect the thought of
marriage with love.
FALLING IN LOVE TOO QUICKLY.
These violent delights have violent ends,
And in their triumph die like fire and
powger.
Which as they kiss consume. The srweet
est honey
Is loathsome in its own deliciousness,
And in the taste confounds the appetite.
Therefore, love moderately. Long love
deth do;
Too swift arrives uas tardy as too slow.
No one save Shakespeare could aim
at and hit a truth more squarely in
the words "violent delights have vio
lent ends." Putting it more plainly
he meant to ay: Loving in haste Is
a puaslon which soon burns itsdef at
If it has not had time to take root,
thus establishing a firm foundation,
how can it be expected to flourish and
its blossom to last?
Romantic women wonder if it is true
that love is born at first sight. While
a few cling tenaciously to the belief
that those intended for each other rec
ognize that compelling power that
seems to draw them together. at
the first meeting of the eyes, touch of
the hand or sound of the voice, more
serious-minded people, who have
delved down far deeper than the sur.
face of the subject, as earnestly de
clare that love is not-never was
born at first sight. Admiration and in
terest can be awakened and the hope
for future meetings.
That is an excellent beginning or
foundation for building up oe ti gr
t. The next step or, ,ather,
for nurturing the sweet and
er passion, is companionship-the
magic influence of the charm of per
sonality. Next-and of far greater ims
portance than is accredited to it-is a1.
lowing the thoughts to dwell constant.
ly on the person one is subtly at.
tracted to.
Tender thoughts woven into beauti
ful day dreams which beget longings
are responsible for the mischief.
Thoughts are the sun rays which
cause the flower of love to burst forth.
The man who gives no thoughts tc
love in the hours when he is alone and
has time to look into his own heart
and read the records there of the im
pressions each call upon a certain dil
vinity has made upon his susceptibility
is the man who is never quite sure if
he is really in love or not. Therefore
he Is very careful about being non.

How could he be expected to tell
the young woman what the import ol
his many calls is when he has got
nowhere in his calculation or hopes
He is of the class of men who are
laggards in loving afid who waste a
woman's time over a lapse of years
to no purpose.
Every plant has an allotted time to
grow from its first inception to the
bursting forth of its perfe?td flower.
Love, the most beauteous, fragile, yet
sturdy plant of the heart, must go
through the same process. Some loves
never blossom, but die in th' bud
through endeavoring to forc3 them tc
bloom too quickly. Men or women
may be impetuous by nature, but they
err when they pin their faith to the
belief that they have actually falleo
in love hastily and that it will last
ANOTHER IN HER PLACE.
They say if our beloved dead
Should seek the old familiar place,
Some stranfer would be there instead
And they should find no weleomlnr face.
Believe them not. Ah, those wlo may
Our best beloved would find no place
Have never hungered every day
Through years and years for cne dear
face.
They laugh at war who never felt a
swordthrust. They sneer at the fool.
ishness of being jealous who never felt
its pangs. In the case of lovers who
have disagreed, or, perhaps, have had
a downright quarrel and parted, the
girl, at least, wonders, anxiously, if he
makes no attempt to be reinstated in
her favor, whether or not he has put
another in her place.
It is one of the hardest ordeals a
girl can face to find her surmise is
true. She worries secretly over the
thought whether she should go among
the friends they were wont to visit
together or remain away, escaping the
embarrassment of meeting him with
a new sweetheart. Her friends coun
sel her to encourage a new admirer.
Nine girls out of ten are too honest
to resort to this, believing it to be dis
honorable to encourage a man's suit
when neither her heart nor her wishes
respond.
While a lover is true to her, hope
bridges the dark current of fear, but
the knowledge beyond all doubting
that another has filled her place is a
woe that strikes deep into the heart.
The girl is indeed a heroine in real life
who can school herself to meet a for
mer lover face to face, hold out her
hand in greeting and smile that he
may think she does not care. When
it comes down to cold, hard facts she
should not care, realizing that a heart
that could be shifted from one woman
to another as easily is not worth
grieving over, not worth a tear.
No man of principle would subject
a former sweetheart to such embar
rassment if it were possible to avoid
it. The girl who has supplanted her
should not feel overtrlumphant. 8he
should realize there is a world of truth
in the old saw, that "He who can break
troth with one girl without even a
heart throb of regret can always break
with another and yet another."
There is another class of men-end
noble are they-who love once and
forever. They wed the sweetheart to
whom they have given all the alec
tion of their hearts and if she is taken
from them they will never put apother
in the place made sacred by her. They
revere wocmankind for her sake, but
their hallowed memories of the bliss
ful hours that are no more are dearer
than any iving presence could be.
Whether or not a lonely future is
wisest and best is for them to de
termine. There are hearts which
blossom but once and only once. The
fear of many a good and loving wife
is that were she to pass away another
would in time fill her place in her haus
band's heart and home, aye in the af
fections of her children.
Such a fear should never be allowed
to darken the sunshine of a happily
wedded woman's life. That which we
dread most never happaems. One bride
to whom this thought was a terrify
in bugaboo wearied of her naloving
spouse with the wuainag of the hose
