Small Vote in All Parts of State at Tuesday's Primary
VINCENT VICTOR BY FIVE VOTES IN
THE CONTEST FOR REGISTER OF DEEDS
No Progressive Votes Cast and But Scattering Pro
hibition and Socialist Votes.
The primary election in Michigan Tuesday for tho nomi
nation of candidates 'of all parties. for Governor, Lieutenant
Governor, United States Senator, Congressman, State Senators
and Representatives and county officers aroused little real
interest except in counties where there were several candidates
for most of the county offices, and this applies only to the re
publican ticket. There wore practically no contests , for demo
cratic nomination of any offices anywhere in the state ana ine
Socialists and Prohibitionists only cast scattering votes, while
the Progressives apparently have returned almost unanimously
to the republican party.
The contest for governor-was hippily settled in -the se
lection of Albert E. Sleeper of Bad Axe, a substantial and
popular business man, known for his upright dealing, good judg
ment and his . excellent record as a public official. Frank B.
Leland. a well known Detroit business man, ran second to Mr.
oieeper; urarrit o. i-neneina miru, yyasuiujjiuu yaiuuci iuuhu
and Sybrant Wesselius fifth. -
Luren P. Dickinson, of Charlotte, present lieutenant
trovcrnor and who had been hierhlv favored as a candidate
for governor in all parts of the state, but who withdrew at the
rannaef r,f tn mr Trrlin Virmorht hie rhitv l.iv in acaln nresidinp"
over the State Senate, was triumphantly renominated over a
field of excellent candidates, David E. Heineman of Detroit being
second, W. D. Gordon of Midland third, Robert Y. Ogg of Detroit
fourth and Frank P. Bohn of the upper peninsula fifth.
Hon. Charles E. Townsend received an enormous majority
over Wm. H. Hill of -Detroit for United States Senator, and
Joseph W. Fordnev distanced W. J, Cone for the eighth district
congressional nomination. ; f
The contests for county offices was confined to county clerk
. j i e jx j a 11 a. t "vr: v. l ,. J t-m
ana register 01 ueeus. aiucii
clerk over Milton F. Growe, of Owosso, who made a surprisingly
good run considering his lack of acquaintance.
" The contest for the republican nomination for register of
deeds was the hardest fought battle and was won by Edmund R.
Vincent of Middlebury, who had five more votes than Gilbert J.
Cole. E. D. Brooks, the third candidate,was far behind the others.
: The statement of votes for the contested, places, by wards
and townships is given below and the full tickets as they will
