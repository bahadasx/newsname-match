Brother-in.-Law of Kaiser.
The reign «f Constantino I., as king
of the Hellenes was brief, dating only
from March 18,^1913, when his father,
George L, was assassinated in Saloniki.
Brief as the reign was, Constantino
enjoyed'a period of remarkable popu
larity and increased the territory of
the Greek monarchy by over 60 per
cent.
Born on Aug. 3, 1868. he was edu
cated largely by private tutors from
Lelpslc, which was said to have
stamped upon him a permanent Ger
man influence. His military education
was furthered by attendance at
maneuvers In' Germany. He became a
brother-in-law of the German em
peror by marrying, the latter's sister.
Princess Sophia. In 1889.
His alleged pro-German leanings,
thus indicated, were not always popu
lar with bis people, and during the
European war a strong party antago
nistic to his desire to have Greece pre
serve neutrality and in favor of Join
ing the allies, precipitated a ce*inet

In 1896 when he saw his country
drifting into war with Turkey, he
snjinded a warning that the Greek

little 'in common with the Greeks. The
king and queen were hooted in the
streets, and the officers turned their

There' IS in existence in Greece a
committee representing the liberal or
Venlzelos faction and it is possible
the Greek garrisons surrendered to
this or some similar body. The com
mittee was appointed Sunday, on the
occasion of a demonstration of 50,000
Greeks before th% residence of "Venl
zelos at Athens".
The part of Greek Macedonia in
which the forts mentioned are located
is In northern Greece, clore behind th*
n-ont on which the entente allies are
fighting the Bulgarians. Vodena is o«
the railroad line between Saloniki and
Monastir, an important means of
communication for the entente allies.
It is forty-five miles west of. Saloniki.
Fort Little Karaburun is on the gulf
of Saloniki, about ten. miles south of
the city.
Allies Intervene.
Further details of the disturbance In
Saloniki are given in a later dspatch
to Reuter's today.
The volunteers surrounded the bar
racks In the night cut the water mains
and cut off the food supply. A detach
ment of sixty regulars attempted to
force a way out. Its surrender-was
demanded and when the regulars re
fused the volunteers fired into the air.
The regulars replied to the volley and
then the volunteers .fired at them.
The allied, commander, General Sar
rall. intervened to preveht bloodshed.
Altogether three men we^e killed and
one gendarni© ftnc! thrp* volunteers
were wounded.
The soldfers refused to treat with
the revolutionists but accepted terms
from the allies. The men were dis
armed^but the officers were permitted
to retain their swords. The barracks
were turned over to, the French.
It is £lso reported that the garrison
at Vodena went over to the revolu

1917, that overtime shall be pro-rata,
but adds that within not less than
six nor more than twelve months after
Its passage the interstate commerce
commission shall assume jurisdiction
of the question of hours and wages
and that they shall be subject to
change from either the employes, the
employers or the public.
Text of Provision.
The text of the provision follows:
"That the interstate commerce com
mission shall have the power to fix the
hours of labor and prescribe just
wages for all employes. The rate of
wages and the hours of labor pro
vided for in this act shall be remained
fixed for service and pay until changed
by the Interstate commerce commis
sion, which within a period of not less
than six nor more than twelve months
shall determine what are Just wages
and what are equitable hours of labor.
"The liit»rs'af.e commerce commis
sion shall have the' power from time

and i'ne sche.iuie of p»y either In
whole or in part on the petition of the

Poss'bi'ity of Hitch.
The possibility of a hitch seemed to
be in this added provision, which is
being studie:! by the brotherhood load

proposal that on the report of the
eight-hour day commission the inter
state commerce commission "shall
consider an Increase of fieight rates to

Chicago, Sept. 1.—Counsel of tl)e va

formed the presidents if the railroads
that the .Adamson bill, is patently un
constitutional, as being confiscatory
and class legislation.
W. p. Rinjfty. president of the Siir.ta
Fe, said today that the passage of the
bill would merely 'postpone the strife.
"Our lawyers," said Mr. Ripley, "in
formally and Individually have ex
pressed the opinion that the Adamson
bill, if passed, will jcrumble at the
first legal Must. If the bill passes the
presidents and counsel will confer as
to legal procedure, jit is illogical that

R. H. Aishton, president of the Chi

roads would obey the law,, but, he said,
"It seems certain to us that the Adam

Officials of the four railroad broth

here today to direct the strike on

terminals of the Chicago, Milwaukee &
St. Paul .railroads, announced today
that the .Brotherhood of Railway Con
ductors, On the sectioi} of that system
between- Chicngo and the Missouri
river, had voted not to strike.
Santa Fe Lifts Embargo.
Certainty that a general railroad
strike will not materialize Is seen in
an order issued at the general offices
of the Santa Ke system in Topeka last
night by General Freight Agent J. R.
Koontz lifting the embargo on perish
able freight.
Instructions Were sent out authoriz
ing freight agents to accept ship
ments to arrive later than Sunday
—the date recently set when no more
shipments woul2 be uccepted. Such
merchandise is to be sent at the own
er's risk over Santa Fe rails, freight
paid in advance. Live stock ship
ments are accepted.
Shippers Make Request.
"Many shippers informed us that
they were willing to take the chances
in shipping, in spite of the fact that
the strike is scheduled to start Monday
morning," said Mr. Koontz in explain
ing the order. "Our embargo on live
stock still holds good."
This order had not been received at
the local Santa Fe freight offices up
to cloHinB time lust night, according
to employes. Other trunk lines, with
headquarters in rhicarro. have not yet
issued any similar orders modifying
the embargo but froight traffic offi
cials said such a move was not un
likely.
The text of the railroad's statement
said:
"The managements of the railways
are disregarding reports from Wash
ington regrardihg the possibility of the
strike beHng prevented and proceeding
as they would If assured the strike
would begin on the morning ot
