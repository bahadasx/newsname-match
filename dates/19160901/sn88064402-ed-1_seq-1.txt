SUP[, WILL ENFORCE
COMPULSORY EDUCATION
In spjeaking o0 the Compulsory
Educatiull act which was passed by
the last (henn al Assembly Supt. W.
P. Arnette of tne parish schools has
left us witn the impression that the
spirit of the law would be enforced
to the highest degree in the parish.
The compulsory education law re
quires every child of school ago who
is sound in body and health to at
tend school at least seven months in
the year, unless a good and suffici
ent excuse can be furnished for their
non-attenldance, such as a widowed
mother to suiport or serious illness;
and providing that a child shall not
be absent from school mor4 than five
days at any one time without suf
ficient excase, with a penalty of ten
dollars fine for each offense.
This law also requires children to
enter the schools not later than two
weeks after the opening of each
term.
This regulation is of special im
portanace in the case of beginners or
children in the first grade. Parents
should be notified that children in
the primary or first grade will be ac
cepted only during the first two
weeks of the first and second terms.
Unless this rule is followed the first
grade will be composed of several
distinct groups.
ELTON WOULD WIN
FOOTBALL GAME
Reports from Elton early in the
week state that the Elton boys are
going after the foot ball game in
earnest this year. They have been
practicing hard all summer. "Dock"
Pennington, Jr., is captain and W. H.
Bradford ,manager. They are very
proud of the success which has
crowned their efforts to secure Jim
Thackston on the team this season.
Jim made an excellent record as an
all-round athlete while attending the
Jennings high school last term.
ELTON NEGRO JAILED
FOR SHOOTING UP DANCE
At a coon town hall in Elton Sun
day morning Charles Perkins fired
two shots into the body of Chune Le
vergne, another negro, which will
probably result in the latter's death.
Depu*, Sheriqf IMaihs Fusclier ar
rested Perkins and lodged him in jail
at Jennings where he will await the
result of Levergne's injuries.

FARM LOAN BANK
DISCUSSED HERE TODAY
Interested farmers and business men
were in attendance at the meeting
hbeld at the Auditorium this morning
when the merits of the Federal Farm
Loan Act were discussed at lenght by
Mr. W. J. Leppert representative of
the proposed Farm Loan Bank of New
Orleans.
The support of the farmers of this
section is being earnestly solicited for
the selection of New Orleans as a site
for one of these farm banks, and the
preliminary work comprises a cam
paign of education, so that the farm
ers may become familiar with the
rural credits system as it will apply to
the agricultural sectians of Louisiana.
SWAT THE CATTLE TICK!
34 VATS IN JEFF DAVIS PH.
Every person who owns a cow
should join in the crusade against
the tick: Especially is it important
with regard to milk cows. It has
been estimated that ticks reduce milk
production by 25 per cent. It takes
blood to make milk and the ticks get
the blood and thus reduce the flow of
milk. A single cow infected with
ticks contribute 200 pounds of blood
each year. This. is a shameful condi
tion and should be remedied.
Beef stock likewise cannot possibly
thrive and develop into good stock
where these numberless .parasites
have to be fed from their blood. Let's
swat the cattle tick.
There a r e thirty-four dipping
vats in Jeff Davis-a vat in reach of
most any farmer in the parish. With
the state wide dipping laws, no one
need be afraid of eradicating the
ticks from his own farm and then
getting them fom his neighbor. Two
years from today we will have no
ticks. Farmers in every community
should begin to inaugurate plans for
ridding their farms of the pest. Swat
the tick.
-The citizens of Welsh will learn
with pleasure that Manager R L. Ab
bott of the Southern Rice Growers'
local orrice has decided to make his
home in Welsh, his son, Lawrence and
daughters, Misses Beatrice and Ruth,
having arrived. last week from their
former home at Taylor, Texas. " They
are making their residence in the
Montgomery house east of the Com
mercial Hotel.
IMPORTANT NOTICE.
All sqhool books and school sup
plies will be sold for cash only this
year, and no exchanges will be made.
This announcement is made in order
that pupils of the school may secure
lists of their needs from teachers be
fore making purchaases.

RICE INTERESTS CONDUCT
CAMPAIGN OF EDUCATION
Beaumont, Texas, August 29.-How
to cook and eat rice as a vegetable, as
a substitute for navy beans and po-!
tatoes, which are more expensive,
less nutritious, less palatable and
harder to digest, is the object of a
campaign just launched by the
Southern Rice Growers' association in
conjunction with a number of Texas,
Louisiana and Arkansd rice millers..
For the first time in history, experi
enced chefs are going into the United I
States army camps to demonstrate
the food value of rice.
J. R. Leguenec, secretary of the i
Rce Millers' association, with a corps
of fifteen chefs, is now enroute to
Fort Sam Houston, where he will be
gin a series of demonstrations. Dr.
W. W. Duson, vice president for Texas
of the Southern Rice Growers' asso
ciation will reach San Antonio Thurs- I
day and, under his personal super
vision these demonstrations will bei
carried through every camp on the 1
Texas camp.
Formal permission to conduct this i
campaign of education has been re
ceived from General Funstop, and the I
work will continue for at least' two
months.
About six weeks ago the Southern
Rice Growers' association sent Mrs.
M. A. Hayes of Houston, to San An- I
tonio to confer with army officers
with a view of inducing them to-edd
more rice to the soldiers' rations.
Since then the government's rice or
ders have doubled. But even now
there ..are few troopers, either regu
lars dr militiamen, who have ever
eaten rice in any other form than '
rice pudding. *
"Being a strength, vitality and en
ergy producing food, possessing heal
ing and curative properties and being
more nearly a perfectly balanced
food for the body then.any other ce
real or vegetable, rice is a natural
ration for the soldier," explained E.
A. Eignus, general manager of the
Southern Rice Growers' assoclation.
"We believe that soldiers aoght to be
fed more rice, and for that reason we
are going to create an appetite among
·them for this cereal."
He pointed out that.approximately
fifty per cent of the world's popula
tion use rice as a staple food and mil
lions, of people in the Orient and
other hot countries eat rice alomat
exclusively. One of the most amaz
ing revelations of the Ruaso-Japanese
war, he recalled, was the almost pers
feet health of th£e Japanese soldiery,
whose chief diet had always been '
rles.
Scientific test have proven that
boiled rics digests one hour after
eating, while 'wheat bread requires'
three heous and a half; corn meal
thre hour., Irish potatoes ,tbree
hours and a half, roast beef three
hours, stewed oysters two to five
hours, fish an hour and, forty-five
minutes, fried eggs three hours, oat
meal three hours, etc.
Dr. Dueson and his corps of chefs
will teach the soldiers .how to eat
rice and the army cooks how to pre
pare it, placing especial emphasis on
the use of rice as a vegetable with
gravy in the noon-day meal.
*The result of these demonstrations
ill be two-fold. Theg will not only
tihiide the'government to increase its
rice onidrs. for army commissarIes,
but ll put taste fer tics in the
mtothsrd of h Mlllt1san fem the
