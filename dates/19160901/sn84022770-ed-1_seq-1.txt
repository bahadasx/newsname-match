GETTING READY FOR
SECOND LOCAL FAIR
VARIOIS NEW FEATURES A IS
RANGED I OH ,\X\I VI, SHOW
SEPTEMBER 11-10.
With Saturday scheduled as "tag
day" to raise finances for the Fair,
with a crew of men at work on the
grounds preparing them for the
week's exhibition, and with the race
program arranged and most of the
entertainment concessions contracted
for, details for the second annual
Thurston County Fair September 11
to Iti are being rapidly whipped into
shape, according to an announcement
made this week by Secretary L. L.
Snow.
Various new features are promised
at this year's show, among them
community exhibits by half a dozen
or more subordinate Granges of the
county, a demonstration tent for lo
cal auto dealers, an exhibit by the
United States forestry department,
and a generally larger series of dis
plays throughout. Last year only one
community exhibit, that of the Pleas
ant Glade Grange, was displayed at
the fair.
Secretary Snow went to Chehalis
Wednesday to attend the Southwest
Washington Fair, to complete ar
rangements for the race program and
for further concessions, anil quite a
number of local people visited the
neighboring exhibition and adver
tised the local shows. Premium lists
and entry blanks are ready for dis
tribution and may be obtained from
Secretary Snow or the Chamber of
Commerce.
Mrs. C. Nommensen and Mrs. E.
W. Olson, together with two women
to be named from the country, will
have charge of the sale of tags Sat
urday and will be assisted by a num
ber of women and girls. It is ex
pected that a considerable sum can
be raised in this way, which will as
sist materially in defraying the ex
penses of the fair.
Both the Northern Pacific and 0.-
W. R. & N. railroads have offered
special rates of one and one-third
fares to the city from all nearby
points during fair week. The in
creases in the number of displays ex
pected and the entries already made
have caused the directors to arrange
for the erection of one more large
exhibition tent than was needed last
year.
Program for Week.
The tentative program for the
week is as follows:
Monday—Entry day, entries clos
ing at 6 p. m.
Tuesday—Formal opening.
Wednesday— Olympia day.
Thursday Mason county and
Southwest Washington day.
Friday—Children's day.
Saturday—Everybody's day.
The fair directors announce that
the grounds will be kept open until
10 o'clock each night, when both the
exhibits and concessions will be open,
A straight admission charge of 25
cents will be made, no season tickets
being sold, children less than 14
years old being admitted for 15 cents.
There will be a 10-cent fee for the
grandstand and a 50-cent charge for
parking autos inside the race track,
though another site will be provided
where automobiles may be left with
out charge.
Big Fund for Forest Trails.
The state of Washington will re
ceive $91,379 of the federal fund of
$1 ,000,000 just appropriated by con
gross for the construction and main
tenance of roads and trails wholly or
partly within national forests, ac
cording to an announcement made by
Secretary Houston. Applications for
roads or trails must be filed with the
district forester by October 1, each
application containing a statement of
the estimated cost, of desired
road, the territory to be served and
the extent to which it would aid in
the development of the resources
upon which communities within or
adjacent to the national forests are
dependent.
All of the lowa reisdents who live
In Olympia and the neighboring
country joined in an annual picnic at
Priest Point park Wednesday, when
corn was the principal "piece de
resistance" on 'he menu of the boun
teous dinner served at noon. An in
teresting program was given during
the afternoon.

tory.
The Washington Cement Stave
Sili) company, one of Olvnipia's new
industries, iliis week shipped a car
load of Piayford cement s;ave silo
material to Seattle, to be used in the
erection of several silos in the sur
rounding territory. The company's
first silo in King county will be one
of 100 tons capacity, 14x40 in size,
to be built at Kenton.
The local firm plans to establish a
branch factory in Seattle soon for the
benefit of customers in King and
Snohomish counties. It recently
completed two silos at South Union
and announces that others will be
built, shortly in this vicinity. The
company has material for a dozen or
more silos on hand and additional
material is being manufactured daily.
ALL SCHOOLS WILL
BE OPENED TUESDAY
MORE PUPILS EXPECTED IM THE
COt:XTV—< ITV EMROLMENT
SAME AS LAST YEAR.
All of the city schools and, accord
ing to County Superintendent O. C.
Goss, practically every school in the
county, will open the new school
year next Tuesday, September 5,
meaning a new record for Thurston
county, for last year, for instance,
nearly a month elapsed between the
opening of the first county school and
the last. The new plan will make
the school work more uniform
throughout the county.
One of the new features to be of
fered in the city schools this year will
be a course in concrete work and
farm mechanics, under the direction
of C. B. Gwynn, supervisor of the
manual training department. And in
six of the county schools, those at
Yelm, Rainier, Tenino, Little Rock,
Tumwater and Hayes, manual train
ing will be offered for the first time,
while in the seventh and eighth
grades of all of the schools of the
county as well as the high schools
courses in domestic science will be
taught the girl pupils.
More Pupils In County.
The enrolment in the city schools
is expected to be about the same as
last year, Superintendent. C. E. Beach
believing that an anticipated increase
in the high Bchool will more than off
set any decrease in the grades.
County Superintendent Goss expects
a considerable Increase in the county
schools, quite a number of new fam
ilies having settled in different dis
tricts this year, especially at Yelm.
Quite a number of improvements
have been made in the school build
ings of the city and county during the
summer vacation. A pressure water
tank and a motor-driven pumph have
been installed in the McKinley build
ing, affording drinking fountains and
faucets throughout the structure;
new oil burners have been installed
in the high school furnaces; new
plumbing has been installed through
out, affording lavatories in the base-
ment and on the first and second
floors, and the chemical labomtory
has been enlarged.
Out at Yelm a new $4,000 building
is just being completed, the main
floor of which affords the district an
auditorium and gymnasium, the audi
torium being available for community
meetings and evening entertainments,
while in the basement modern equip
ment for manual training and domes
tic science instruction has been in
stalled.
Among the other improvements in
the county schools are the Installation
of furnaces in the Lacey and South
Bay buildings, the addition of one
room to the Stony Point school, where
a portion of the high school course
will be offered this year for the first
time, and the construction at Tenino
of a fine new two-room and basement
building and a new gymnasium, both
heated by a hot water plant located
between the buildings.
In addition to these, minor im
provements have been made to the
buildings in nearly every district,
such as painting, building new roofs,
repairing foundations, digging new
wells, and tinting or calcimlning the
interior walls of the buildings.

OFFDT LAKE PEOPLE WIN
FIGHT FOR OWN SCHOOL
Court Declares Appeal Illegal—Goss
to Appoint New Directors.
County Superintendent O. C. Goss
expects to appoint the latter part of
this week directors for a new school
district at Offut lake, following the
decision given by Superior Judge
Mitchell Monday sustaining the de
murrer interposed by six taxpayers of
the Offut lake district that the appeal
of the Plum station reisdents to the
commissioners was lot properly taken.
Incidentally statements that Prose
cuting Attorney Yantis prepared this
appeal are untrue.
This will be the concluding chapter
in a controversy between the resi
dents of Plum station and Offut lake
for the past several months, which
after a public hearing before County
i Superintendent O. C. Goss resulted in
Ithe creation of a new district at Offut
lake mainly from territory previously
included in the Plum station district.
Various taxpayers of the latter dis
trict appealed from Goss' decision to
the commissioners, and after a liear
i'l?; the commissioners overruled Su
perintendent Goss and re-established
the old district. Then action was
started in the superior court by the
Offut lake people, ending in Judge
Mitchell's decision this week that
the appeal to the commissioners had
not been taken in the proper legal
manner. This re-established Goss'
division of the territory and upheld
the formation of the new district.
Plans for the erection of a school
building at Offut lake will be started
immediately, Superintendent Goss
says, and in the meantime school will
be held in a temporary structure.

OPERATORS SHOWN BY INVESTI
GATION HOW TO INCREASE
RETURNS.
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,
Aug. 31.—Oyster production will
soon be on as sound, scientific and
efficient a basis as any other busi
ness, if the efforts of the United
States bureau of fisheries and Profes
sor Trevor Kincaid, University of
Washington biologist, are to count.
They are showing the operators how
to eliminate loss of revenue by pre
venting the death of the little oy
sters, through the right methodß of
culture.
In the past the operator has
guessed when he should throw in his
"cultch" of old shells for the baby
oyster to fasten to, and all too often
he guessed wrong. The result was a
tremendously high mortality. By us
ing the scientific knowledge, recently
made public by Professor Kincaid,
the grower may now determine the
exact time for putting the old shells
In his beds. This enables the young
oysters to attach themselves to the
shells before they become covered
with slime and moss, and insures the
oysters life and growth.
And the next point, as yet distant,
is to devise an artificial system of cul
ture and do away with haphazard
methods entirely. Professor Kincaid
recently spent considerable time at
Oyster bay, near Olympia, and has
I made a survey of the industry in the
state, from which he intends to com
pile a report for the government.
Next summer he will continue his in
vestigation.
Life of Native Oyster.
Professor Kincaid has made an ex
tensive study of the oyster industry
on the Pacific coast. Recently he
made public a complete history of
the life of the native oyster. Briefly
it is as follows:

Ornamental Km ranee and Fence
Erected by (itvin Hicks Nearly
Finished.
The handsome new entrance gate
and ornamental fence being erected
by Gwin Hicks around the pioneer
cemetery at Lacey will be completed
the latter part of this week, and then
the bronze tablets, four of which
have been on display at Talcott

placed in the six cobblestone piers at
the entrance, and the memorial will
be formally dedicated during the fore
part of this month, under the direc
tion of Mr. Hicks and the Washing

Many of the first settlers of this
section of the Paget Sound country
are buried in this cemetery, and this
fact is referred to in the inscription
on the tablet contributed by the state
historical society and signed by W.
P. Bonney as secretary. Two of the
tablets bear stanzas from Gray's
elegy, while the first contains the in-
scription:
"In memory of his ancestors, and
with a decent regard for the preser
vation of their last resting-place, the
undersigned has erected this fence as
a barrier between the irreverent pub
lic and the revered ground inclosed,
and calls upon his posterity and the
succeeding generations to respect the
bones of the first white inhabitants
of this countryside.—Gwin Hfcks."
LBGIL TEBBEITS
STORE 6 CLOSED
STOCKHOLDERS CONSIDER TAK
ING IT OVER—RECEIVER
TELLS SITUATION.
The Olympia Groceteria on East
Fourth street, one of four stores
operated by M. C. Tebbetts, Inc., the
Tacoma firm which went into the
hands of a receiver a couple of weeks
ago, was closed Wednesday afternoon
by Receiver R. D. Simpson and ar
rangements are now being made to
dispose of the stock. The local store
was the only one of the four to con
tinue operations after the company
was thrown Into a receivership fol
lowing a mysterious Are in its A
street store in Tacoma August 15
and the arrest of the promoter, M. C.
Tebbetts, on a charge of arson.
Several local stockholders favor
the purchase from the receiver of the
stock of the local store, a reorganiza
tion of the Arm's affairs into a sep
arate company consisting of the local
stockholders, and reopening the store
with a new manager in charge. Ap
proximately $lO a share will have
to be put up by the stockholders to
carry out this plan.
All of the 400 to 500 stockholders
in M. C. Tebbetts, Inc., will lose every
cent they put into the concern. Re
ceiver Simpson says, and at that cred
itors will receive only about 50 cents
on the dollar. Whether those stock
holders who have not paid for all of
the stock for which they contracted
to pay on the monthly instalment'
plan will have to pay the remainder.'
is undetermined, the receiver says.
Tebbetts. the promoter of the con-!
eern, received one-third of the rev
enue from all the stock sold as his
commission. In addition to a salary
of $75 a month, Receiver Simpson
says. There are some 400 to 500
stockholders in the concern and al
together some $76,000 stock was con
tracted for, from $15,000 to SIB,OOO
of it locally. Tebbetts' commission
of one-third was taken out of the
first cash paid the company on each
stock sale, the receiver says, and the
total amounted to approximately
$25,000. Out of this he was to pay
a commission to stock salesmen and
all expenses incident to stock selling.
Some $25,000 or $30,000 more
was spent in opening the three stores
in Tacoma and the one here, remod
! cling the buildings and buying fix
tures and stock and in paying sal
aries of employes and operating ex
! penses, the receiver says his exami
' nation of the books shows. The
' firm's affairs are so involved, how
ever, according to the receiver, that
it would take nn accountant a couple
of months to find the true situation.

FIRE REPORT MAY
CENSURE 6IGELOW
CITY ATTORNEY SAID TO HAVE
FAILED TO ENFORCE ORDERS
COMDE.MMIMG BUILDINGS.
Censure of City Attorney George
R. Bigelow for alleged failure to en
force the council's orders condemning
eight buildings in the city as public
menaces from the fire standpoint and
ordering their removal, will, it is re
ported, be the principal feature of
the report to the Civic Bureau of the
Chamber of Commerce by the special
committee recently appointed to In
vestigate the situation with reference
to fire protection.
City Attorney Bigelow disclaimed
to the committee any responsibility
for the enforcement of the condemna
tion orders, it 1B said, but the com
mittee was informed by other city
officials that the responsibility did
rest upon him, and quoted an ordi
nance to that effect. Just what form
the committee's report will take is
not known, but it is suggested by
some that the particular friendship
that exists between Bigelow and one
•r two members of the committee
may result in tempering whatever
references may be made to him.
May Criticise Council.
Some criticism may also be direct
ed at the council itself for failure to
supply the fire department with all
the new hose requested by Fire Chief
B. H. Barnes, but the chief fact so
far uncovered by the committee, ac
cording to all reports, centers around
the failure of whoever is responsible
to see to It that condemned buildings
are removed.
The committee's investigation un
covered the fact that Fire Chief
Barnes recommended the condemna
tion and removal of these eight build
ings some time ago, that the council's
fire committee, after investigation,
approved the recommendation, and
that the council, adopting the com
mittee's report, ordered the removal
of the buildings. The committee
also discovered that the buildings
have not been removed and is report
ed to have come to the conclusion
that City Attorney Bigelow is the offi
cial who has been negligent.
All H»N« Tewt««l.
The local fire department now hits
a little more than 4,000 feet of hose.
Chief Barnes says, all of which has
been tested under 93 pounds pressure
and found to be in good condition.
This is the heaviest pressure the city
water system affords, the average
throughout the city being much less.
Following the fire at the Ohatfield
house, when the department was
hampered in its work by bursting
hose, some 200 feet of hose was dis
carded, the chief says, this being the
portion which bore evidences of acid.
The rest of the hose has been exam
ined for acid and no traces of it
found, he says. The discarded hose,
councilmen say. can be used by the
street department.
The opinion has been expressed in
some quarters that the investigation
has developed a political nature and
this belief has resulted in the sugges
tion that the report would be delayed
until the city campaign comes on the
lptter part of November.
WHOLE NUMBER 2923
ACT OF CONGRESS
MAY STOP STRIKE
PKI:SII>I:\T ISECOMMENDS EMER
GENCY LEGISLATION TO MEET
SITCATTON.
Enactment, by Congress of legisla
tion recommended by President Wil
son in a special message delivered to
that body Tuesday will, it is hoped
and expected, prevent the threatened
railroad strike already called by the
brotherhood leaders to go into effect
next Monday, Labor Day.
Efforts of the president to effect a
temporary settlement of the differ
ences between the railroads and their
union employes having failed be
cause of the attitude of the railroad
presidents, and a counter-proposal
made by the latter having been
turned down by the union leaders,
President Wilson went before con
gress, reviewed the situation and
asked for legislation to meet the
emergency.
All the influence of the adminis
tration has also been brought to bear
on the brotherhood officials to cancel
or postpone the order calling the
strike next Monday, pending action
by Congress. The union officials re
plied that they had no power to re-
call the strike order unless "a satis
factory settlement" were reached, but
they let it be known, after a careful
study of the legislation proposed by
the president, that Its enactment by
Saturday night would prevent the
strike.
Embargo on Freight.
Meanwhile, all the railroads of the
country are preparing for the strike
and have placed embargoes on all
freight which cannot reach its desti
nation by Sunday night. These em
bargo orders were received Wednes
day by the local agents of the North
ern Pacific and 0.-W. R. R. ft N.
Apparently the legislation which is
being counted upon to stay the broth
erhoods is that part of the preisdent's
program which would fix an eight
hour day for railroad employes en
gaged in operating trains in interstate
commerce and provide for an investi
gation of its effects by a commission
or board.
The tentative legislation proposed
contemplates:
Establishment of eight hours as
the standard for a day's work for
railroad employes operating trains In
interstate commerce, and the appoint
ment by the president of a wage com
mission of three members to observe
the administration and financial ef-
fects of the institution of the eight
hour day, the president to submit its
recommendations to the interstate
commerce commission, which would
accept the findings unless clearly er
roneous, and adjust rates to Insure a
fair return on invested capital; wages
of employes not to be reduced, for a
period to be determined, below the
present standard day's wage, pending
the report, and pro rata proportion
to be paid for service in excess of
eight hours; the commission also to
study and report on the problem of
compensation for railroad employes.
Amend Arbitration Law.
Amendment of existing arbitration
law directing the board of mediation
and conciliation, if unable to induce
parties to submit controversies to ar
bitration, to refer differences to a
board for investigation, pending de
cision o? which it would be unlawful
t'or employers to cause a lockout or
employes to cause a strike; each
party to a controversy to name one
member of the board of investigation,
which would consist of three mem
bers.
Empowering the president, when
ever railways engaged In interstate
commerce or in transportation of the
mails shall cease to operate or be se
riously interrupted because of a
strike, to direct operation of railroads
sufficient for military purposes; to
draft into federal service all persons
necessary and to use the military
forces of the nation.
To R*-Wlre Courthouse.
Complaints and objections made
by flre insurance underwriters have
resulted in preparations by the coun
ty commissioners to re-construct the
electric wiring in the county court
house. Other repairs are also to be
made, including patching the plaster
ing in various rooms and painting the
steam pipe= and radiators.
