CARRIERS INSIST
ON ARBITRATION
LAST WORD TO BROTH ERHOOOS
OFFERS COUNTER PROPOSAL
WITH PRINCIPLE INCLUDED.
ALLOWS WAGE INCREASE
EXECUTIVES'! PLANi PROBABLY
WOULD GIVE OVER 10 PER
CENT MORE PAY TO MEN.
t-Liti N-wi.t.-t I iil-iii N- s.i-.e.-
Washington, Aug. 2i - After the
h ads of I he four great railroad
broiherhoiHls threatening a nation
wide strike had gone to th White
House Friday with a waning that
their men would not wait longer than
toniKht for a reply from the railroad
executives to President Wlhotl S SIIK
gestión that an eight hour day be
granted, the executives la it nli;lit
agreed upon a counter propo-al to be
submitted to the President today.
This plan, holding to the detnan I
for arbitration, wbiih the tiuployés
have declared they unalterably op
pose, proposes:
"That the question of an eight hour
day is not directly connected with the
matter at Issue and that lhre is a
difference lietween an actuul eight
hour day and an eight hour day as a
basis for pay.
"That the questions of increases
of wages indisputably are questions
which should be settled by arbitra
tion.
"That the present demands of the
trainmen be submitted to arbitration
by the Interstate Commerce Commls
sion or some board to be created by
the president, or In some other way.
"That If the arbitrating board finds
wage increases should be granted
their finding will be retroactive and
the Increase will tako effect trom the
time the arbitration begins.
"That a fund shall be created by
the railroads to provide for this con
tingency, the Interstate Commerce
Commission to keep the accounts that
will be necessary, and tht arrango
ment to continue in force (or a time
not yet determined upon, the men
agreeing that during the period of ar
bitration there shall be no further de
mands nor any attempt' to strike."
A draft of this report wa-i submit
ted by the committee of eiht presi
dents who have been consiantly at
work upon Its various phuses for a
week. There was some discussion,
but only one vote was taken and by
it the sixty presidents and n anagers
approved the draft. Some slight ad
ditions to the phraseology trn to be
made, and the final draft j resented
at another meeting today.
From that meeting the report is ex
pected to be taken to President Wil
son. It was said last night this will
be the final report of the executives.
Some of the executives ;ald that
while the proposal would not give
them more than 2o per cent. Increase
in wages provided for in effect in
President Wilson's plan, it probably
would give an increase in excess of
lit per cent.
