known Lordsburg citizen, has an
nounced hitaself as a condidate

In the nomination of G. SI. Doo

NEXT AT SILVER CITY
Walton for Congressman
"We want Walton V was
war-cry of the Democrats in
dorsiug their leader for congress
man on the Democrat state ticket.
A flowery resolution was passed
lauding the Hod. William B. and
recommending him as the logical
candidate for the congressional
nomination.
The Albuquerque Morning Jour
nal has the following to say of Sen
ator Walton:
Mr. Walton is considered almost
as certain for the nomination for
the lower house as Mr. Jones is
for the senato. Democrats ar
gue that not only is he entitled to
the nomination by reason of his
ability and marked party services,
but that the logic of the situation
demands that he be named. It is
no secret that the action of the
Republicans at Santa Fe in nom
inating Gregory Page for treasur
er over W. D. Murray, of Silver
City, has left a very sore spot in
the ranks of the Grant county Re
publicans, who feel that Murray
was entitled to the place. Mur
ray and Walton, though opponents
in politics, are without doubt the
two strongest men in public life
in Grant county, if not in all south
western New Mexico, and it is be
lieved that the slight to Murrav
will result in a tremendous. addi
tion to the Democratic vote in
that section if the other Grant
county favorite son, "Billy" Wal
ton, is named for a place on the
ticket.

Quoting Walter- Birchfield, dele

ees for county commissioners from

but pure".

g DETROIT'S IMPRESSIONS OF A MAN.
Governor Hughes' visit to Detroit opened the presidential campaign
of 1916 and If we may forecast the events that are to follow by the
omens of Monday we would prognosticate an Intensely warm, vivid and
humanly Interesting period In the ner.t few months.
Setting aside the auspices of meteorological conditions In this pro
vision of the future although they are approved by numerous profes
sional augurs and by a host of commonalty as well we base this pro
phecy on the characteristics of the candidate whose too brief stay with
us has been enjoyed by all with whom he came Into contact.
The misguided Individuals who have been expecting Charles E.
Hughes would prove to be a cold proposition and therefore easy to
beat are In for a chock that will make them think they have been hit by
an uninsulated trolley wire. There Is nothing cold about Mr. Hughes,
Detroit has learned. He Is about as Intensely human a piece of hu
manity as ever captured the hearts of a crowd, and the more people In
the United States he meets between now and November the more
votes will be catt for him. As a campaigner he Is a revelation. He
likes his fellow beings', and they like him because they see he likes
them.
And what his personality beglne his remarkable powers of Intellect
and utterance finish. He drives his points home with tremendous force.
What he says sticks. There are thousands of Americans today who
can retell every step In the arguments he made eight years ago on
the Bryan trust policy, yet In 1008 Mr. Hughes was not especially a
prominent figure and there was no particular reason why h.s aJ.l.cjs
more than others should have remained clearly In the memory except
the gift of the man to send his own thoughts so deep Into the brains
of others. They are clear In his own mind first, undoubtedly. He Knows
precisely what he wants to say because he has reasoned It out before
lie speaks it out. Probably that has something to do with the fase
with which he convcy3 his meaning. But It Is a very rare quality
he possesses In his ability to master subjects so thoroughly as to make
the most abstruse simple to h'inself and his hearers. It Is a quality
eminently desirable In a political candidate; It Is Infinitely more to be
desired In the president of a great country like the United States.
Detroit's Impression of Charlen E. Hughes Is all favorable. The
thousands of people who have studied him at close range are convinced
that if he Is elected president next November he will be a great presi
dent, one of the greatest tills nation has known, worthy to stand In nJ
history with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, a custodian of 0
q the republic's fate to whom that fate may confidently be Intrusted. J
If that conviction Is shared by the people o,f other states whom he Is Q
H still to meet, the outcome of his swing around the great American )
fO circle cannot fall to be propitious for him. Detroit Free Press. j
