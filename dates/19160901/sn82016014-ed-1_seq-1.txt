Charles Evans Hughe?. Republican
presidential nominee, is today the
guest of Kansas. Accompanied by
Mrs. Hughes, his physician, several
close political advisers and a number
of newspaper men. Hughes entered
Kansas this morning fresh from a
four days' rest in Colorado. In appre
ciation of the Kansas spirit of en
thusiasm, Hughes gave Kansas every
ounce of energy and vigor that came
with his mountain rest. Hughes's
itinerary today called for eleven
speeches and Kansas will draw ten of
them, with the eleventh just across the
line in Missouri.
All along the line of the Union Pa
cific today from Hays to Kansas City
Kansans greeted the presidential
candidate. It was the official opening
of the Republican national campaign
in Kansas. It was Governor Hughes's
first and only trip to Kansas in the
campaign and Republican leaders
made the most of the visit. .
His First. Speech."'"'
At Hays. Ellis county. Governor
Hughes encountered the Kansas style
of strenuous campaigning. It was in
the western normal town that Hughes
made- his first speech before break
fast. Right there a day of real ac
tivity began for the presidential nomi
nee. In all towns along the route
where the Union Pacific limited was
scheduled to stop, plans had been
made by local committees for speeches.
Coming to Topeka. where the prin
cipal speech of the day was deliv
ered. Governor Hughes's energy and
endurance were put to the test. Spe
cial orderB were issued for the train.
Longest possible stops were allowed
in all towns where stops were to be
made. Then the engineer was direct
ed to put on full steam and make up
the seconds and minutes.
At Hays this morning the Hughes
party was met by Fred E. Stanley of
Wichita. Republican national commit
teemen. He accompanied Hughes
thru the state and planned to leave
for Kansas City with the party fol
lowing the Topeka meeting. He will
confer with Governor Hughes and his
managers concerning conditions in
Kansas and will discuss plans for the
national campaign in this state.
At Manhattan the Hughes party was
met by a reception committee from
Topeka. This committee included
Governor and Mrs. Arthur Capper,
Mrs. J. S. West. Senator James A.
Troutman, John Chaney. Frank P.
MacLennan, J. N. Dolley. Ecott Hop
kins and W. R. Stubbs.
No Canned Speeches.
Short. choppy extemporaneous
speeches talks with punch and kick
In them marked the Hughes response
to the Kansas welcome in l he west-
rn towns. With but a few minutes
in each town. Governor Hughes hit
r.ght at the big Issues in the campaign.
The tariff. Wilson's policies in Mex
ico, a muddled, weak an', wobbling
foreign policy and broken promises
lhose were the targets for the short
speeches. All of the talks were ex
temporaneous. Hughes came to Kan
sas. Just as he went to otner states
on his western campaign trip without
canned speeches.
In comir.g to Topeka this t fternoon.
llURhes is following President Wilson
I'l his western trip of last February.
When his trip is concluded he will
have visited every principal point
v.here the president spoke last winter
and will have invaded a territory
where Wilson's speech did rot reach,
except in the printed paes. The
Hughes trip was planned with a view
of blocking the Wilson move of last
winter and in Kansas the Republican
presidential nominee is r.iving full
measure in return for the president's
visit to Topeka.

ATTENTIVE AND CONSIDERATE
3Vot the Wild Enthusiasm At
tending Roosevelt.
3Irs. Hughes Is Gracious, Smil
ing and Charming.
(By Staff Correspondent.)
Kansas crowds which greeted Gov
ernor Hughes on his way to Topeka
today were courteous, kindly and con
siderate. When Hughes reached Sa
lina he hit his stride and appeared to
get right into the. issues of the cam
paign. Mrs. Hughes, modestly dressed and
smiling pleasantly, was welcomed by
the Kansas women with something jf
the Kansas spirit. The response which
greeted the Hughes speeches in the
state was wildly enthusiastic. The can
didate's demand for a protected Amer
ican.citizenship and a definite, fearless
course in the handling of international
affairs, received the greatest response.
Demand for a protective tariff for
American industries was also applaud
ed. But there was not the general
outbursts which characterized the
meetings of either Roosevelt, Presi
dent Wilson or Bryan in their trips
thru Kansas.
Newspaper menthere are a score
of them on the train stated that in
the main the Hughes crowd had been
large, but unresponsive. "The speeches
have meat and road well, but don't get
under the crowds," was the analysis
of one well known eastern correspond
ent.
The First Kansas Stop.
The Hughes train made ita first stop
in Kansas at Kllis shortly after 7
o'clock. Here the presidential candi
date hurriedly left the breakfast ta
tle and talked for Three minutes to a
crowd of several hundred people
many of whom had also delayed their
breakfast. Mrs. Hughes walked onto
the rear platform with her husband
and greeted the first Kansas crowd
vith smiles and bows.
Right at the fim stopping point.
Governor Hughes put one over on his
stenographers. None of them was
present to take his speech. For that
reason the candidate's first Kansas
talk will never be officially chronicled.
The Hughes party was making the run
tnru Kansas on a special train, being
listed as the first section of the regu
iai. Kxcellent accommodations were
afforded the party.
When the train reached Hays, near
ly ten minutes late. Governor Hushes
talked for five minutes to a crowd
ff probably 800 people. Governor
Hughes talked harmony and a pro
tective tariff to the crowd. Present
conditions are inflated, he told the
crowd, because of war in Europe. But
America should prepare thru protec
tion for the future. European nations,
he said, would offer hot competition
in commercial affairs when strift is
ended.
The train stopped two minutes in
Victoria. But Victoria's gain was Rils
seU's loss. The special did not intend
to stop at Russell. Otis L. Benton.

WAR WON'T SAVE DEMOCRATS
People of This Country Have
Too Good a Memory.
Candidate Speaks of Sturdy
Americanism in State.
Governor Hughes this afternoon
turned his guns on the Wilson policies
in handling international affairs and
declared American industry would be
protected only through a safe and
sane protective tariff. America must
prepare to ward off European nations
following the war. was a keynote In
the candidate's address.
. Speaking from the north steps of
the state house to a crowd that had
patiently awaited his coming, Gover
nor Hughes said in part:
"The fact that you are here, in such
large numbers shows that you have
a very deep interest in the questions
of the campaign. I did not expect to
occupy this position. I was contented
with the place which I held ami
thought I should continue to hold it
as long as I was able to render serv
ice. But when the demand came in
the way in which it did come, there
was no honorable alternative, and I
entered upon the work of the cam
paign wit hzeal and- enthusiasm, be
cause a man can have only one ambi
tion in this life, and taht is to do the
most he can according to his oppor
tunities for the service of his fellow
man. That is the spirit in which I
( am here.
"I know that the people of Kansas
are thoughtful and deliberate. The"
! desire to consider peaceably and care
; fully the questions that are brought
; before them. We have, it seems to
I me, a critical period in our history at
iiusiime. Alter tne European war
there will be a new era in this world
Kurope is not going to be the same
Europe it wasjjefore. The nations are
better equipped and disciplined than
over before. They have had a marvel
ous exhibition of their taltnt for or
tanization and applied capacity. They
have shown an extraordinary energy
in this struggle, and they will turn
their energy and efficiency and capac
ity into the enterprises to business as
soon as peace is resumed. What is
the United States to do? My friend,
the United States must wake up. It
must be solicitious for ltB own inter
ests. It must be prepared to uphold
its own by upbuilding policies.
Broad National Policies.
"Now, I stand for a partv that rep
resents the broad national policies
I which are essential to the welfare of
i this country.
I In the first place, we stand un
j flinchingly for the maintenance of
American rights thruout the world.
;We do not propose that there shall be
; any mis-stating or misunderstanding
! of our attitude. We are not warlike
( or militarists, but the same indom
itable spirit which gave us the coun
try" and which preserved the country
is with us today. It is not a spirit that
desires trouble. Only an inexcusable
blunderer could get this country into
war. But on the other hand, we pro
pose that American citizens shall be
protected wherever they are. We pro
pose that our words shall convey all
we say. Further, we propose that we
shall have upbuilding, fostering poli
cies. "I stand for the Republican doctrine
of protection of American enterprise,
agricultural and industrial. We can
not expect to hold our own if we
frame our tariff solely with reference
to revenue. That is the doctrine of
our opponents; and doctrine more
unfitted to American prosperity could
hardly be conceived. It is unworthy
of Americans to say that we would
take a great governmental power and
fail to exercise it in a way to foster,
to stimulate and ei: courage legitimate
Interest in this country.
"I do not propose to have abuses in
this country. We must work scien
tifically and carefully, but with intel
ligence and in accordance with correct
principle. The principle Is the thing.
We should not be afraid to apply our
principles becausa of abuses, possible
abuses. You would not run express
trains at the high rate of speed neces
sary to carry it to their destination on
time, if you allowed yourself to be
paralyzed with fear unless some acci
dent should occur. You propose to
have and you obtain competent intelli
gent engineers, and then you run full
speed ahead and in that way carry out
your design. I propose in this coun
try to have efficiency in administra
tion. It is no use to multiply depart
ments or bureaus of administration by
legislation unless you have those de
partments vitalized by action, and
conduct of- administration that prop
erly reflects American talent and ca
pacity. "I want to see protection not only to
American industry, but protection of
the human resources of this country
by every intelligent effort to build up
and provide what is reasonable, safe
and careful, and in all ways conducive
to the betterment of human lfe in con-
I nection with our great industrial oc
' cupations.
Wants National Resources Conserved.
.'I want to see our national resources
conserved. Above all, I desire to see
in our political life an entire absence
of prostitution of governmental activ
ities to partisan ends. When we come
to public business we should be deal
ing with things in a business-like way.
I regret to say that the present admin
istration has not supported the prin
ciple of the merit tystem as it should
have been supported.
"Now, we want to build up Ameri
can enterprise by efticient adminis
tration. That is the most construe-
W2y
i
-SSf
tiv thing I know. Three-fours of our
public life is simply business-like ad
ministration simply keeping Sown
waste and enforcing the statutes, as
they were intended to be enforced-
and having American government
realize its ideals and not simply a
government on paper, not a govern
ment for the benefit of favorites or
to pay political debts; but government
according to our institutions, realiz
ing the ends of free government,
which must be efficient government.
"If we do not have in this country
a proper regard for our rights as
American citizens, we will enter upon
a period of decadence. We cannot
have prosperity if we do not safe
guard our industry and enterprise.
Every one of the nations of the world
is going to safe guard its resources
and its interests. If we do not have
efficiency and economy in every de
partment of our government, we shall
enter upon a period of decadence, for
every other nation in the world will
have theml If we cannot rise in this
time to the conditions of rivalry which
will be brought to the fore because
of the new conditions created after
the war, we shall inevitably enter up
on a period of decadence; for we must
go forward; we cannot afford to stand,
still.
"You remember the conditions
which existed after the passage of the
Democratic party tariff bill a short
time ago. You remember in almost
every city in fact in every city of
the country the unemployed were
walking the streets in search of work.
It was impossible for enterprise to go
ahead it was palsied, it halted, and
thepe was contraction, and there 7i
a condition thruout the country which
made every one fearful of the future.
Then came the European war, with
its extraordinary demand for our
product. Now. the people of this
country have not got short memories.
The Democratic party is not going to
be saved by the European war; and
if U were not for the European war
there would be little patience with the
policies which have been enforced.
1 desire to see an unswerving loy
alty thruout this nation, wtihout re
gard to race or creed, which will give
us the driving power necessary to at
tain our ends. We must have every
body strong with the feeling of what
I call 'applied Americanism, and in
tense desire to have our government,
in its efficiency and all that goes to
make up the strength and prospertiy
of our nation, equal to its great task
and its past.
Sturdy Americanism in Kansas.
I know that in Kansas you have
a sturdy Americanism that does not
need in any way to be fostered to a
degree that has not been heretofore
manifested You are all patriotic in
Kansas, and have an unswerving loy
alty to the flag; and I have felt as I
have gone thruout the country that
this is the dominant eense of the coun
try a consciousness of our national
unity and an appreciation of our na
tional opportunity, and the great de
sire that in this critical period in our
history we should do all we can to
achieve American ideals.
"I want to see respect for American
citizens, and have the American name
honored throughout the world. There
is not the slightest reason why Amer
ican citizens should be murdered and
their property destroyed simply be
cause of failure to afford protection.
All we need is firmness and persist
ence, and have it understood that the
American name is to be respected and
American rights enforced. That
means peace and security not war

State Auditor Davis Succeeds Banker
at, Hntchlnson. -
The following announcement, signed
by K. W. Cooter, president, has been
sent out by the State Exchange bank
of Hutchinson:
"We regret to snnonnce. that Mr. F. C!.
Ksths will sever his active connection with
this bank September 1, 1916. to beroim
president of the Kansas Reserve State
Bank. Topeka, Kansas.
"We are. however, glad to be able to
announce the election of Mr. W. E. Davis,
now auditor of state, to. succeed hlin as
cashier."
Mr. and Mrs. Kaths came to Topeka
this week and are now settled in their
new home, the Spielman property, at
the corner of Huntocn and Tyler
streets. Mr. Davis is a stockholder
in the new Topeka bank.
The new bank will open for busi
ress with exceedingly bright prospects
at 824 Kansas avenue as soon as the
fixtures, not yet quite completed, are
installed. The bank will be an im
portant addition to tne nnanciai in
stitutions of the capita! city and will
be a factor in increasing the already
hirh financial standing of Topeka.
The banks of this city are all pros
perous. It is conceded by those well
informed on the subject that there is
ample room for the new bank. The
banking facilities here, good as they
are, are not up to those in other cities
of our class.
The new bank already has 105
shareholders, including in the lis suc
cessful business and professional men
in all lines. The number of share
holders exceeds that of any other bank
in the city. No institution of its kind
was ever before organized here with a
capital of more than half that of the
Kansas Reserve State bank. Most of
the stock has already been placed, and
it will all shortly be withdrawn from
the market. The organization is for
tunate in its possession of men of wide
banking experience, established suc
cess in business and with reputations
for integrity and ability based upon
years f business associations in To
peka and Kansas.
The banking room equipment will
be of the best in facilities, quality and
substantial character.
The officers of the new bank are:
F. C. Kaths, president; Frank P.

Judge 'Dana Issues Decree
Against Brotherhoods.
MOVE ON OFFICERS 0. R. C,
Injunction Against Calling of
Threatened Strike.
Fred G. Fisher Obtained Au
thority Last Niirht.
A temporary restraining order en
joining six officials of the Order of
Railway Conductors from calling the
threatened strike of conductors was
obtained at 6 o'clock Thursday eve
ning by Fred G. Fisher, a conductor
on the Union Pacific, from Judge A.
W. Dana of the first division of the
Shawnee county district court.
The temporary restraining order is
against A. B. Garretson, president of
the Order of Railway Conductors;
Charles H. Friday, chairman of the
eeneral committee on adjustments of
j the railway conductors; R. L. Civer,
ductors on the Union Pacific; Elsmere
t,oieDaugn. cipher correspondent or
the railway conductors on the Union
pacific. j. A. Bergen, chairman of
the committee on adjustments of the
ilway conductora on the Unlon Pa
cific division No. 342. and F. J. Col-
- lin. vice chairman or the committee
beaded by Bergen.
i ne temporary injunction papers
were served this morning on Bergen,
a conductor on the Union Pacific, as
he passed thru Topeka on his run. So
far he is the only respondent upon
whom service has been obtained.
Hearing for a permanent injunction
against the union heads is set for the
morning of September 7 at 9 o'clock.
Local Strike Tied I'p.
- Fisher, as a conductor, would at that
time permanently enjoin all the de
fendants from calling a strike and
would also legally restrain them from
expelling him from the union because
of this action.
Under the temporary restraining or
der the union heads are now tied up
to that extent until the morning of
September 7 at the time of the hear
ing, insofar as the Shawnee district
court Is concerned.
'Fisher is thoro In his legal steps. His
petition against Colebaugh, cipher cor
respondent, would mean that Cole
baugh could jiot legally receive and
translate any cipher message which
would mean a walkout.
The injunction here is similar to
that obtained by Union Pacific men
all over the country. According to of
ficials of that company the trainmen
on that road are vigorously opposed to
a strike. Eighty per cent of the Union
Pacific trainmen recently sent a peti
tion to congress asking that body to
avert a strike.
