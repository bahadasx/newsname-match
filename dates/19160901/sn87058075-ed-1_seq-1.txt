OFFICIAL PAPER OF THf CITY AND COUNTY
Rural School Notes.
Monday, Sept. 4, is the opening day
•of school in nearly all the rural school
districts in the county, and parents,
-teachers and pupils are wondering
about the new text books. The read
ers, spellers, grammars, physiologies,
civics, agriculture and drawing were
changed, and Farm Accounts, Bourne
and Benton's Introductory History,
"Lincoln's School Kitchen Text Book and
Blair's Sewing Tablets were added to
the list, A list of the books with re
tail price and exchange price, a course
of study showing what books to use in
«ach grade will be sent to each teach
er. The child should take to school
with him the first day, the books he
used last year and these should be used
at least a week, or longer if necessary,
before the teacher decides what new
books he should have. If parents at
tempt to buy the books before receiv
ing word from the teacher what books
to buy, much needless expense, or loss
of time on the part of the pupil in try
ing to get along with the wrong book,
will be the result.
At no other time is the co-operation
and good will of the parent more needed
and appreciated by the teacher than at
this period. It is a difficult problem
for the teachers Jto classify the pupils
correctly, and decide just what books
.should be used, and parents can facili
tate matters very much if they can
.realize this and extend their sympathy
and help, rather than detrimental criti
cism. Let us not rush into the pur
chase of books, but find which is the
.right book and then purchase it at
once so the teacher will not have to
wait for it. I shall visit every school
as early as possible, taking only time
to talk over the program and course of
•study with the teacher. Unless the
weather is bad I can reach nearly all of
•them during the first two weeks, and
ishall do all that is possible to aid the
teacher in deciding the books to be used
.by the various classes.

Riceville Man Elected Head
Des Moines, la., Aug. 24.—Matt Mc
Cook, of Riceville, was elected presi
dent of the Iowa Association for the
Advancement of the Deaf, at the clos
ing session of the State Convention at
the Auditorium yesterday afternoon.
The election, like all other business
of the convention, was conducted en
tirely in the sign language and with ab
solute silence, except for the applause
following each selection of an officer.
At the morning session yesterday,
Miss Florence Hetts presented a paper
on "The Women of To-day and the Bal
lot," in which she applied equal suffrage
to the deaf women as to all others and
declared that the progress made by
women along educational, industrial
and all other lines had been achieved
by the deaf women.
The report of the resolutions commit
tee which was adopted includes a "dec
laration of principles" which condems
the movement now on foot in Iowa to
enact legislation making compulsory
the oral instruction of deaf children at
the State School, and declares that ex
perience of many years has demonstrat
ed to the graduates of that school that
the combined method, now ieing used
there and at the most progressive
schools of the United States, is the
most practical system.
Married.
On Wednesday Aug. 30th, at the M.
E. parsonage, Rev. Wm. Kerwin offici
ating, Eva Grabau and Dan Murray,
both of Bonair, were united in marriage.
The young couple left the same day for

number of the neighbors and friends of
Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Evans gathered at
their home in the West End to help
them celebrate their 26th wedding an
niversary.

come with well filled baskets of dainty
viand*.

Cresco Auto Trails Association.
The Cresco Auto Trails Association
was formally organized Thursday even
ing, with aboard of five directors. The
object of this Association is to procure
as many trails as can be had crossing
Howard county, and to see that the
trails are properly marked and sign
boards placed to aid the tourist in trav
eling across the country. The marking
of the roads in Howard County of course
does not mean so much to the Howard
county automobile drivers, as they are
familiar with the roads anyway, but the
Howard county drivers, like all others,
find that marked trails are a great help
in following the roads from one place
to another, and as the Howard county
drivers use the marked trailsjin places
beyond the county, and upon the roads
not known to the drivers, it is only fair
that we should see that the Howard
county roads are well marked that the
drivers from the other counties|can have
the same advantage and assistance in
driving in Howard county as we have
in driving through the other counties.
'September Morn" Coming September
18th.
"September Morn," originally dated
for August 22nd and cancelled on
account of Gollmar's circus, has been

out and consider it a great popular
price attraction.
The show carries 30 people, a very
attractive scenic production, unusually
good voices and very clever comedians.
The performance moves with snap
and ginger and is full of action and
comedy.
