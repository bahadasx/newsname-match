A A pet dog belonging to the woman

bullet holes were found in th ceiling

house-
The last time the woman was seen
was Monday, when a couple of the
habitues of the district spoke to her.
Prescott, who had been down in
'Texas, camo back to Flagstaff on the
!late train Saturday night.
Bloody Note Found.
; A blood smeared note was found
on the dresser, which from compari
son with other letters, was undoubted
ly written by Prescott. It read:
"To the Public:
"May and I quarreled over a P. I.
that always came here and tried to
break up our home, and she attacked
me with a razor which is around here
somewhere. I shot her then myself.

ters were formed smoothly and on
even lines with capital letters and
general makeup of letters found ad
dressed to his wife in her trunk.
Many Ghastly Wounds Found.
There were many ghastly wounds
found on the two bodies. The woman
had been shot through tho head twice
and her throat cut. Either of the
wounds would have produced instant
death.
Prescott's throat had been cut from
ear to ear, and several deep cuts were
found in his back and a bullet wound
in his head. From the nature of the
wounds and tho condition in which the
two were found, it does not seem pos
sible that tho note left by Prescott
covered the tragedy.
Bodies Found Wednesday.
The bodies were found Wednesday
afternoon by Judge Harrington. Ev

just north of the little shack where
the tragedy occurred, wished to 'see

The little board shack contained
but two rooms and was enclosed, ex
cept the front door facing north, by
a high board fence. There was no
evidence in the yard to give a clew
to the double killing, except a few
exploded cartridge shells. There was
a smear of blood on tho doorknob out-
side and a slight stain on tho screen
doon "Inside' it looked as though an
attempt had been made to wash up
the blood stains with water.
The ghastly affair seems shrouded
in mystery. It docs not, look proba
ble that Prescott could have shot the
woman, wrote the note, shot himself,
cut his own throat in such a manner
and then set fire to the bedding which
partially covered them both.
"Dutch May" Peters, as she was
known here before being married to
Prescott some months ago, has lived
here a good many years and had ac
cumulated considerable property in
the restricted district. She had the
reputation of being peacefully in
clined, with no enemies.
No one knew of any trouble be
tween she and her husband previ
ously, and letters found in her trunk
from him did not indicate any pre
vious trouble, but that they were on
the most affectionate terms with one
another.
RAIN iMAKES POTATOES'

Flagstaff has been enjoying con
siderable weather the past few days.
The weather man reports there was
.87 "of an inch rainfall Monday night
and the hot and cold machine regis

county.
Up in Port Valley there is a hurry
up call out for the farm doctor on
account of the fact that rains have
been making the potatoes bust out of
their skins, they are growing too fast.
This is not one of Art Williams' crook
ed well stories, but an actual fact.

RIG RAILROAD STRIKE
IS GALLED FOR MONDAY
-" - e
The big railroad strike of over
400,000 men is scheduled to take place
next' Monday, Labor Day, unless they
are granted their demands for an
eight-hour day by the railroad man
agers. President Wilson has not been able
to bring about any solution of tho
trouble, but as a last resort, is advo
cating the passage of a compulsory
arbitration law similar to that in
vogue in Canada.
The railroad managers are making
every preparation for the impending
strike and seem to have deadlocked
"with the men.
Late reports last night gave no en
couragement to tho outlook.
SELLS CONFECTION DEN.
Bert May has sold out the con
fection den and bakery to Borum and
Ramsey, who will take charge of the
place today.
Mr. Ramsey has been in the em
ploy of Mr. May for some time and
is an expert candy maker, having
learned his trade in California. Mr.
Borum is well known here, having
sold out his interest in the Crawford
& Borum grocery, now being con
ducted under the name of the Craw
ford grocery, to Jos. Crawford.
Mr. May has not decided. as yet
what he will do in the future, but
hardly expects to leave Flagstaff.

Mr. P. J. Linderman returned Sun

operations were very successful,
which will be pleasing information
for their friends.

Pi's a Ford Forty Miles From Ink
Mr. A. C. Wrenn, editor, and pub
lisher of the Arizona Blade-Tribune,
published at Florence, drifted into
Flagstaff from tho south in his
Hennery F., accompanied by his two
sons and wife. They had been' out
to tho Grand Canyon and the only
trouble reported by Editor Wrenn was
too much" impression on one corner of
the machine when he went to press,
about 40 miles out of Flagstaff on
the Grand Canyon road. The hub on
his journal threw a scarehead and
pied right in the middle of the road.
Journeymen came along and left
enough quads at his camp to keep his
form up until ho got a new chase
from Flagstaff to run the rest of the
edition into Flagstaff.
Mr. Wrenn left Monday for a trip
to the Petrified Forest and will be
home in time to see that Olney gets
his vote in the primary election.

Guadelupe Valdivena, a young Mex
ican about 25 years old, was struck
by No. 10 Sunday evening at the San
Francisco street crossing and narrow

the cowcatcher down in front of the
depot, where he fell off on the south
side of the train between the tracks.
His left arm was stripped of flesh
and will have to be amputated; his
skull was fractured in back of the
head with a bad gash on the side,
made when the engine struck him.

THE WEATHER AND
CROP CONDITIONS
t
Summary of weather and crop con
ditions in Arizona for the week end
ing Tuesday, August 29, 1916:
Warm weather continued with fre
quent showers in the central and
eastern counties. The condition of
the cattle ranges -is reported good to
excellent, and stock in fine condition.
This summer has been very favorable
for dry farm agriculture. In the
northern counties good crops of corn
and potatoes are indicated, while dry
land forage crops such as milo, Su
dan, kaffir and field beans have made
splendid growth and excellent yields
seem assured. Haying continues in
all parts of the state. Cotton is be
ing picked on the Yuma and Salt
River projects. Plowing for winter
wheat has begun in the northern
counties.
R. Q. GRANT Meteorologist
West End Candidate
For Supervisor Here
A. R. Montgomery was in the city
from Williams last Friday interview
ing the republican voters as to his
candidacy for tiie nomination for su
pervisor, claiming with, every degree
of reason, that the west end of tho
county should be represented on the
board.
Mi. Montgomery has been a resi
dent of Williams for the past ten
years, during which time he has been
connected writh the Saginaw & Man
istee Lumber company, in a respon
sible position.
His friends believe he is a capable
man and one that would make good if
ejected to that office. He is not so
well l.nown here because his work has
prevented his getting away often.
WANTON DESTRUCTION.
Not very long ago the men at the
Flagstaff Lumber Manufacturing
company's logging camp found a "six
point" buck staggering about out in
the woods. Some one had shot this
deer, but had not succeeded in kill
ing it outright After three or four
days suffering, the deer was found
and put out of its misery.
The Northern Arizona Game Pro
tective Association offers a reward of
fifty dollars for any information
which will lead to the arrest and con
viction of the party or parties who
shot the buck. Communications can
be addressed to the secretary, Flag
staff, Arizona. See ad in this paper.
Such acts as this one have cut J
down, in this country, the game sup
ply of deer, antelope, turkey and
other diminishing game. It will not
be long until a previous plentiful sup
ply of game will simply be a memory,
as the buffalo of yesterday.
TOM CAMPBELL AT WILLIAMS.
A good representation of the Flag
staff republican club and candidates
went to Williams by auto Monday
evening to attend a joint meeting of
the ladies and men of the Williams
club. Tom Campbell, republican can
didate for governor, and other state
candidates addressed tho meeting.
They were given an enthusiastic re
ception by th people there, and
brought along with them good reports
of political conditions in other parts
of the state.
A NEW GRANDPA.
M. W. Craig, while he does not look
it in the least, was recently advised
by his daughter in Salt Lake City,
that a baby girl had arrived at the
Parkinson home some six weeks be

now. His daughter spent .the summer
here with him about three years ago,
and is well known to many of the
young people of Flagstaff.

he was thrown back on the side of the
track he started across from.
It was first thought that ho had
be enkilledoutri ght, but medical aid
was rushed to him and he was taken
to the county hospital. The following
day he was able to get up and showed
remarkable vitality after the shock.
The accident occurred within sight
of a hundred people or more, who
were waiting for the train to pull-in,
but strange to say only a very few
people saw it.
Valdivena has been employed at the
F. L. M. sawmill for a long time and
is well known here.
WILL ORGANIZE SDFFRAGE
CLUB IN COCONINO COUNTY
"Suffrage First," the slogan of tho
Woman's party, is once more being
heard in Coconino county, with the ar
rival of Miss Vivian Pierce of Cali-
fornia, who has just come to Flagstaff
to perfect the organization of the
Woman's party, which was organized
in Arizona some months ago by Mrs.
St Clair Thompson.
The Woman's party, a party com
posed of women onl with one plank
in its platform and no candidates, was
born in Chicago at the time of the
great national conventions, writh the
sole aim of pressing the federal
suffrage amendment, popularly known
as the Susan B. Anthony amendment,
through this session of congress, or
through the next congress.
Miss Pierce and twenty-four other
organizers for the Woman's party
are canvassing every suffrage state,
asking the women voters to lay asido
their partyfcffiliations for one election
and put "suffrage first" The little
phrase has become their national slo
gan. Three young women are at
present in Arizona for the purpose of
making the appeal for the liberation
of the women of the east to the
women of the west Mrs. St Clair
Thompson, a democratic southern
woman, has abandoned the traditions
of her family to work for suffrage in
the present campaign. Miss Iris Cal
derhead, now organizing in Apache
county, is the daughter of ex-Repre-
sentative Calderhead, of Kansas, a
Bryn Mawr graduate, and a zealou3
worker for the federal amendment
1 Miss Vivian Pierce, the young
woman who is organizing in Coconino
and Mohave counties, is a Californian,
for ten years identified with news
paper work in San Francisco and Los
Angeles. She has given up journal
ism until after the passage of the
federal amendment, she says:
"We are an absolutely non-partisan
suffrage organization," says Miss
Pierce. "We are telling women how
not to vote and how to vote. There
is but one party, the democratic
party, that at the present "moment
does not believe in the liberation of
all the women in this country by the
speediest possible route the passage
of the suffrage amendment through
congress. All other parties stand for
the amendment Hughes has strongly
endorsed the federal suffrage amend
ment "President Wilson believes in the
enfranchisement of Indians and of
Filipinos by the federal government,
but not in the enfranchisement of the
women of this country. For four
years the party of which he is tho
leader has steadily opposed the pass
age of the suffrage amendment, this
congress not even allowing it to come
to a vote in tho house, that tho peo
ple of this country might express
themselves on the matter. Even the
democrats of the suffrage states de
manded that suffrage be voted on this
congress in vain.
"We are therefore asking women,
who we believe for this ono election
will be willing to place the welfare
of all the women of the country
above mere party, to vote against the
re-election of President Wilson, and
the candidates of the house and sen
ate who are supporting him In that
they belong to his party.
"Before I leave Coconino county I
hope I will have a strong organiza
tion in every precinct of this county.
I would be pleased to have all the
women who are interested in this
great question communicate with me
at the Ideal Hotel."
George Morse, an old-time resident i
of Flagstaff, was in Flagstaff from
Snowflake this week. George says t
that range conditions and sheep in his
section of the country are just about
right and the stockmen are not com- ''
plaining in the least.
