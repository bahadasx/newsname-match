Industry of Washington, Idaho
and Oregon, Is Declared.
Although commending President
Woodrow Wilson for his purpose of
averting tha threaten! railroad strike,
the Weat Coast Lumberman' associa
tion, after a meeting at Bridal Veil,
Oregon, telegraphed th committee of
railroad president In Washington, D.
C, urging that they adhere strictly to
th principle of arbitration In dealing
with the trainmen's wsg dispute
arlala. Politic, it la Bald, did Dot tit-
ur In the action of th lumbermen'
aasociation.
It la a business proposition with th
lumharman. as thev XDfS It and
their action waa nnanimoua. The sug
gested advance In freight rate to ab
sorb increased operating costa In tha
avant nf en eiirht-hour dav compromise
In th railway wage controversy, is re
garded by West uoaat lumoermen aa
likely to disturb th commercial and
Inriuatrial fabrie of th nation. Tha
lumbermen maintain that while aome
line of business enterprise oould read
ily adjust to th new order .of freight
rataa. tumbarifla- In th SUteS Of
Washington, Oregon, California and
Idaho practically would ba proauatM.
At Raturdav'a mfletinr It WSS aaid
that depression in lumber so keenly
felt In all line of Pacific Northwest
business enterprise wa due to the fact
that Inn fralrht hauls to leadinff con
suming market prevented Weat Coaat
forest product rrom uccaaiuuy com
peting with similar product' reaching
ihnaa mark ate on a shorter haul and
more favorable freight rates. It was
argued that market lor weei umsi
wood could not ba extended under
kaa mnriitlnna without llffhtlv low-
red freight rate. It waa cited that
a carload of common fir dimension
lumber loaded in Portland for Chicago
waa worth 1250 at the mill and 1680
delivered in Chicago, th freight being
1330, or 80 more than tn vaiu oi
th lumbar. Common lumber waa aaid
to ba from 65 to 75 par cent of th
tog. Intbabig Chicago market Wt
Coast lumber meeta competition from
similar sawmill product from Louis

Why Berlin Permitted Publication is
Mystery Believed Kaiser Will
. Not Be Much Influenced. .
Washington, D. C Grand Admiral
von TirpiU, author of th policy of un
restricted submarine warfare upon
merchant craft haa issued a manifesto
demanding war with th United
Statee.
Information to thi effect ha been
ri-iwmA hv tha State denartment and
haa caused considerable concern to th
officiate.
Von Tlnrite insists in his statement
that Germany la handicapped in the
prosecution of her lire-and-deatn strug
gle by the limitation Imposed upon
submarine operation by the German
government at th instance of th
United State.
He areues that this country, in any
ease, 1 hostile to Germany and that
th time baa goo by to consider its
wiahaa Ha halievaa ahoald the United
State enter the war on th side of the
allie It would do no mor harm to th
G re man causa than it haa already
done.
The text of the Von Tirpit memor
andum waa published by the Berlin
newspaper. Th foreign eorres pend
ente were not permitted to transmit it
to their paper. A a consequence,
only the neutral diplomat have been
able to lorwara it oy cipner roeseagei
and in their official mail pouches.
It ia not believed by the authorities
that the German Kaiser will permit
himself and bia government to be In
fliumrd into the adontion of a hostile
policy toward the United State. Nev
ertheless, ft is considered Digtuy sig
nificant that the papera were permit-
Mat w MUUan IM Vw-Tur- i, imif
festo and that at the same time the
German authorities gave to the press
tb fact that tha American govern
ment haa mad confidential inquiries
in regard to th submarine attack on
the American steamer Owego.
According to the Information in
possession of the authorities here, a
Herman submarine discharged 10 shots
at the Owego when she waa in the
vicinity of the English Channel.
Tkaaa ahnta were not fired as a warn
ing and the Owego waa making no at
tempt to escape. None or ine anon
took effect and the Owego consequent
ly suffered no damage. '
