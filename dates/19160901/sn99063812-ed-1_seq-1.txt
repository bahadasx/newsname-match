Rushing Action on Bill.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Sept 1.
The house of representatives at noon
today adopted a special rule whereby,
the vote on the Adamson bill, provid
ing an eight-hour day, will be taken,
this afternoon at 4:30 o'clock. The
rule was adopted after an hour's de-.
bate In which Representative Bennett
protested against "such shotgun pro-t
cedure" by the-railroad brotherhoods1
in forcing legislation "with a gun,
against the head of congress."
In pledging his support of the bill
Representative Cooper said the broth
erboods were law abiding, but that'
President Wilson was responsible 'for
the present crista. He said:
"This is not an eight hour law. but
a piece of legislation to increase the
pay of railroad employes."
"I do not think anyone believes this
bill will prevent a strike," said Repre
sentative Bennett.
As the house passed the special rule
Senator Newlands introduced an eight
hour bill in the senate. Senator Gal-
linger said: "There will be no oh-'
structive tactics; the bill probably wll
pass tomorrow.nighh"
The senate expects to rush the bfll
through tonight, if possible.
After a conference with Malorttv
Leader Kern of the senate and Senator
Newlands, President Wilson left tha-
Capitol, saying: "I hope the bill will
be ready to sign by Sunday."
He Intimated that his cabinet ex
pects the bill to be passed tonight.
Hie house this afternoon exempted
electric and independent railroads ot
less than 100 miles from the Drovi-
slons of the Adamson bill. The bill
also was amended to make the meas
ure' effective January 1st. instead of
December 1st, conforming with the
senate bill.
The brotherhoods are reported to be
opposed to this amendment, but are
willing to accept it if necessary. t
The senate bill provides a fine ot
$5,000 and imprisonment for one vear
for any person delaying or obstruct
ing the movement of a train. It is be
lieved the brotherhoods will oppos
this feature of the measure.
