PASSAGE OF HILL WILL

Through tho Introduction in congress
.. , , - ,
yesterday of a mcasuro known as tho
Adamson bill, it is believed that a
strike of tho railway employes has
been averted.
Tho Adanison bill would provide
for nn eight hour day at tho present
tcn-ltcur day pay, effective next De
comber 1. Employes would bo given
tho pro rata rato - for overtime. A
commission of threo to be appointed
by tho president would report to him'
and congress In net less 'than six nor
more than nlno months tho effect of
tthe eight-hour day.
I It is expected that this bill will pass
iboth tho houso and senate today.
Snd brotherhood officials announce
fimt it .the bill is passed as introduced
tho strike will bo called off.
However, Halo Holden, president of
tho Chicago, Burlington & Qulncy rail
road, who was spokesman for the rail
Way magnates at their recent confer
ences with tho president has de
clared that tho passage of tho Adam
son Ocmpromlso eight-hour bill by
congress would not bo satisfactory to
tho railroads and would not settlo tho
ponding controversy. "It is my un
derstanding," says Mr. Holdon, "that
the supreme court! of the United States
has held recently, in 'twto cases, that
the congross of tho United States has
absolutely no powor tjo fix wages.
That is what tho Adamsou bill amounts
oj according U my understanding."
(There has evidently boon tin rrtann.
tidn of tho railroads in lining up tholr
forces preparatory to a strike Mon
day, and yesterday embargoes were
placed on all live stock shipments.
JRailrcads centering In Chicago are
still making arrangements to uool their
resburfces In order to keep traffic
moving should a strike be called.
'Charles Bogue, of this city, chair
man of tho trainmen of tho Union Pa
cific, is at the Carlton hotel in Omaha
but tho Bee says ho refuses to be In

It takes tho North Platto valley to tell
tho real "killing story." B. J. Soger
has been compiling somo figures from
tho reports of the gopher trnppors un
der tho government project, and tho
results are little short of amazing.
Ho reports that friom January 1,
191C, to dato thero havo been turned
Into his office 40,783 palm of gophor
toes, which wore trapped icn ho 1111
farms under tho ditch. Making a to
tal of $4,079.30 which Is paid to tho
chlldron at 10 cents for each pair of
feet brought In. Juno was tho big
month, ovor 14,000 being killed that
month. This month tho trappers are
reporting that tho gophers aro pretty
hard to find. 5,210 woro killed In July
which bears out tho theory that the
bounty does somo good. People who
know nothing of farming undor Irriga
tion do not realize what damago a
gophor can db ta a waterway, and
cannot understand tho reason for the
attempts to extormlnato tho posts un
til they hear of a break In a largo ditch
bank, ns a result of a gopher. Tho
trapnors in this work are not onlv
earning a little money, but aro nlso
doing worlc hardly B bo estimated.
