Provisions of Shipping Bill
First Steps in Powerful
tions to See the Light
Hornet's Nest Force Replaces Diplomacy.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 31. Retaliatory legislation in support
of diplomatic protests against the Allies' interference with Ameri
can trade has been decided up V. as a general policy of the govern
ment. This was stated officially today with the explanation that
provisions of the shipping bill an d the pending revenue bill were
first sTeps.
Up t0 now, a high official pointed out, the United States has
relied solely on the sense cf justite of the belligerent nations, but
that, despite the principle of which this government has denounc
ed as illegal in a sweeping note, trade pressure and discrimination
has been increasing exasperating ly.
Powerful Weapon j
Consequently the government haa
decided after discussion between Sec-1
retsry Lansing and members of ron-1
press. TO empower wie int-Murin w i
emnlov commercial retaliation. This!
rourse would have been taken some
time ago. it was intimated, except
that all plans of retaliation proposed
were obviously illegal.
Slap At British
The amendment to the revenue bill
would erve the President discretion-
" .
ary power to prohibit the importation
of products which cannot be 'imported j
into foreign countries from the United ,
States. This is aimed directly at the
British embreo restricting the ship-'
ment of American tobacco.
May Deny Clearance
The amendment to the shipping;
bill gives the secretary of the treas
ury discretionary power to refuse
clearance papers to all ships refusing
to take American business on other
grounds than lack of space.
This amendment is designed to
reach allied vessels which refuse to
accept the goods of American firms
on the Rritish commercial blacklist.
Allies In Terror
Passaqe of the shippina amend
ment preatly disturbed the allied
embassies here and prediction
were freely made that this coun
try might be embarkina on a
traWe'war that would be disas
trous to all concerned.
May Sod Munitions
J'ist what form of retliation
miaht be expected has not been
forecast. It believed the Am
erican munitions trade with the
allies which might be sooped hv
art of onqress. furnishes a suffi
ciently powerful weapon for use
as a last resort.

WASHINGTON. Aug. 31. Belief grew in all quarters here tonight
that the great railroad strike called for next Monday would be averted.
Congress apparently was prepared to pass tomorrow or Saturday the
8 h'jur day legislation which heads of the employes brotherhoods
have declared will cause them to telegraph the code message necessary
to cancel the strike order.
Although President Wilson still desires strongly to see his whole
legislative pi'jgram accepted, administration spokesmen virtually con
ceded tonight that the bill finally passed would provide only for:
8 HOUR DAY.
An eight hour day for trainmen in interstate commerce, effective
December 1 or July 1, with the present 10 hour rate of pay and pi'o
rata overtime.
A small commission appointed by the President to Investigate the
working of the law and report to Congress.
