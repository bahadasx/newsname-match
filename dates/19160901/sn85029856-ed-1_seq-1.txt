t Summers Store Robbed . '
The Chas. Summers ft Sons dry
goods store was robbed some time
Saturday night and clothing and
shoes to the amount ot $237.00 were
taken. It is thought tbat two or
three men operated. Entrance to the
store was made at the rear of the
north department. After removing
the screen, the window glass was
broken and then the latch holding
the window In place was removed.
The window was raised and the men
were In possession ot the store. They
secured two leather bags and two
suit cases and filled them with three
and a half suits of clothes, silk shirts,
handkerchiefs, socks and Douglas
shoes.
The robbery was discovered Sun
day morning and Sheriff Dobson in
formed, who started investigation.
Sunday evening, while the Frank
Caudle boys were hunting In their
sorghum field just east of the city,
they found two new suit cases and
the hand bags and immediately in
formed the sheriff. The official went
to the Caudle place and when look
ing over the goods, picked up a man
who appeared to know considerable
about the goods. The man gave his
name as W. D. Moore and It appears
that he is not employed at anything
in particular. He was searched and
a key was found in a pocket that
fitted one ot the suit cases. Moore
was taken to the Jail. All the goods
taken from the store have been re
covered. Sheriff Dobson has picked
another suspect and may have an
other today. He feels certain that
he has one of the robbers and there
are good chances for finding the others.
Lampe Sells Lumber Yard
Wm. Lampe, who has been operat
ing a lumber yard on East Second
street for the last two years, sold his
business the last week to H. C. Wil
son ot Hutchinson. Mr. Wilson has
been traveling for the American Sash
ft Door Co. of Kansas City, Mo. He
is expected to come to Liberal at an
early date and take charge of the
yard. He expects to enlarge the
stock. Friends In the city who have
known Mr. Wilson for some time say
that he .is a good business man and
will doubtless make a success ot the
venture. ' Mr. Lampe will devote his
attention to other interests.
PRATT HAS ANOTHER FIRE .
"The city h Pratt hadr another de
structive fire early Tuesday morning.
The Jett Mercantile Company, whose
store was destroyed by fire last
spring, was again a victim, and the
fire took the Morrell Five and Ten
Cent Store and Bert Dodson's Imple
ment store. The fire Is supposed to be
of Incendiary origin. The fire loss will
mount up into the thousands. The
Dodson store carried no Insurance.
However, all the parties who were
burned out have already obtained of
fice rooms and are figuring on going
into business again as soon as loca
tions can be obtained.
The sewerage system is to be ex
tended to the south side of the city.
The Eureka Steam Laundry and sev
eral other business concerns in that
section will be able to connect to the
sewer line. The contractor will go
under the tracks of the Rock Island
at a point between the passenger and
the freight depots. This extension
will cost the city considerably more
than was first thought would be ex
pended, but the need for a sewer sys
tem In the south part is imperative.
KISMET WILL CELEBRATE
The little city ot Kismet will hold
a clebration next Monday, September
4, -In honor ot the many things that
have been done by her enterprising
citizens during the past year. Kis
met boasts of being the fastest grow
ing town on the Rock Island In south
western Kansas, and when we look
at the past year's record we are al
most inclined to believe she is right
about it. The town now has three
and a half times the population of a
year ago, has built at least a dozen
substantial residences during that
time, a $3,500 church, several new
mercantile buildings,, a brick bank
and a two-story building with hall
upstairs, a new depot, addition to the
school house, and a two-story ware
house, the latter three being now un
der course of construction. The peo
ple of Kismet think .they are Justly
entitled to celebrate such a prosper
ous condition of affairs, and have se
lected the date mentioned on which
to do so. It will be a big picnic and
.carnival to which the whole world is
I invited. The day will be filled with
entertainments, sports, merry-go-round
for the children and other car
nival attractions. Geo. H. Rose of
Kismet has charge of the concession
end ot the picnic and anyone desiring
t6 ruff a stand bn the grounds that
day should get In communication
with him. The people ot Liberal are
expecting a food delegation p Kis
met folks down during the fair andf
It would be a good Idea to go to Kis
met next Monday, spend a day with
our neighbors and extend them a cor
dial Invitation to our fair that starts
a few days later. ".:) Jffl
