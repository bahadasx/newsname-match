PAPER FACTORY
Tavenner Would Cut High
Cost of Product.
By ANDREW K. KELLEI.
Representative Tavenner, of Illinois,
yesterday took steps to have the gov
ernment manufacture its own print paper.
by the introduction of a bill appropriat
ing $1,000,006 for the construction a wood
pulp mill.
Citing that Uncle Sam is at the merey
of the paper trist and compelled to pay
exorbitant prices for print paper, the
IlIlinois legislator would have the pub
lic printer authorized to begin the con
etruction of a Federal paper mill or the
purchase of a suitable pia.t capable of
turning out fifty tons of paper a day.
At the present time the government!
uses about twenty-five ton@ a day at the
Government Printing Office. The ad
vance in the cost of the product will In
crease the cost of maintaining the plant
for the current year to the extent of
thousands of dollars.
The Tavenner bill authorizes the pub
lic printer to locate the new plant on
nnn land in that Part of the
'nitedi States where th. raw materials
can be secured most economically and the
mill operated most efficiently. If no gov
ernment land Is found suitable, authority
is given for the purchase of a site in
a desirable location.
The Secretary of the Interior is in
ttructed to co-operate with the public
:1irinter ia the' furtherance of the estab
tishment of the venture by releasing such
government lands that contain timbe
and wood pulp or othe- products neces
sary in the manufactufe.
Government officials are directed to
keep an account, showing exactly what jn
the cost of manufacturing the pap, r
amounts to per ton. and an annual re
port will be made Io Congress detai'ing s
the exact cost of manufacture.
These statistics. it is pointed out. wi1
,'be available for newspaper publishers all
over the country and will constitute a
standard of price by which they may
determine whether they are being over
charged for their paper.
It is specifically provided that if the
government is unable to utilize the full
output of the mill, it may Pell any aur
plis in the open market at cost.
Fer earrying out the provision of the
bill. the sim of $1.Cl.(0 would he pro
ided, with an annual appropriation to
bc mad. for the permanent maintenance
of the mill.
R1eprwentatiue Tavenner believes that
his bill is thoroughly practical and an
nouned 5esterdav that he proposed to
push it It was referred to the Com
mil tee in Printing. and if it is not re
pried wihin a reasonable time, the lit
tois Congressman proposes to call It up on
tthe floor of the House.
The bill is prompted from a belief that
the present high price, for print paper
aenot jutfed aV t s4 t t., sow
ernment engaged h fl
Ithis commodity, definite and accurate sta
Itlstics on the actual cost are available
that will operate to prevent extortionate
prices.
As a measure of economy for the gv
ernmet,t which is one of the largest I
users of print paper in the country. Rep
resentative Tavenner believes the bill '
will be a success. p1
