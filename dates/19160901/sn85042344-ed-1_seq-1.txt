Houses "Will Act on Legisla
tion Affecting Rail
Crisis Today.
BROTHERHOODS ARE
READY FOR ACTION
Representatives Argue for
Nine Hours Over Pro
posed Measures.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 31. Repre
sentatives, of the railroads, of
the Irainnien'B brotherhoods and of
shippers' organization argued for nine
hours todny before the. senate Inter
alate commerce commission on legis
lation proposed to avert the thrcatned
mi ike. recompense the roidfl for any
Added financial burden and pet foot
machinery to make Impossible In the
future another crisis like the pies
ent. TonlKht the committee worked
until late on a bill to be presented to
the senate tomorrow. (Jut of the nine
hours' argument two facts stood
clearly. In the estimation of all af
fected parties congTess alore can pre.
vent a -trlke and the public eventu
ally will foot the bill for un elght
liour day with ten hours pay which
the trainmen demand. The railroad
executives and the shippers insisted
that the strike order at least should
De postponed, and the four brother
hood chiefs declared with equal ve
hemence it could not bo.
All sides apparently were more or
less satisfied with the hearing which
had given them an opportunity to lay
their cases before the public.
A dramatic scene In wMih A. H.
Or.rretson, spokesman for the train
men and president of the Order of
Hallway Conductors, was the central
figure, brought the hearing" to a cli
max tonight shortly before the tak
ing of testimony closed.
Throughout the day members of the
committee at different times had
asked the four brotherhood heads if
they were powerless to atop the strike
fsv'a by reporting a satisfactory set
tlement o the men. Tne question In
varlftl Iv was evaded, the replies be
ing that Mr. Oarretson would explain
the situation before the hearing
closed.
For almost an hour Mr. Ctarretson
kept the crowd laughing with quaint
expressions and humorous stories.
When he had only three minutes left
In which to speak, his brother presi
dent tinted him to answer the ques
tion of power to postpone a strike,
lie Middcnly hcrnm serious, stood
erect, razed at the celling1 for a mo
ment and then beg-an to speak.
"We havs been asked," he said
slowly, "If we have the power to de
fer this rtrikn. It has been called
for next Monday. I have the power
to defer that dite In my organization,
but In the other organisations the
situation Is different. Tho heads of
the other brotherhoods cannot call
back the strike order.
Can I Fn It.
"But here Is where I stand. For
years mv men have trusted me. W hen
1 stood before the president the other
night anil he asked me If this could
be done I found my Qethsemane. To
the men who have made me the re
cipient of all these things I owe m
first obligation. I can put It rff. but
If I did without gaining satisfactory
settlement there would linger In the
minds of those who have trusted me
thoughts of treachery. If I put It off
serosa a fair record of thirty years
would be written the word 'traitor. '
For a moment the witness paused
and seemed to peer far out over thw
heads of the crowd.- The tears camo
Into his eyes and rolled down his
cheeks. He started to speak, nut
choked. Apparently summoning all
nh- strength he threw out his arms,
lowered his eyes to the crowd and in
a low voice asked "can I face It" and
dropped Into his chair.
Not a person In the room moved for
several seconds. Mr. Oarretson re
lieved the situation by rising from hl
chair and leaving the chamber.
A. P. Thorn, counsel for tho railway
executives advisory committee, closed
fur the railroads with a summary of
argurrcr.ts against the eight-hour day,
"We do not claim the right to de
c'de this question," said Mr. Thorn,
"rnv more than wc think any Inter-
crted party ought to be allowed t
decide It. we were told that the eight
hour day was not arbitrable. The
answer to that Is that these gentle
tn' n would not have an eight-hour
day nnd would not accept it If It was
terdered to them.
Mr. Thom said that never In any
legislative act nor in any party plat
form had the position been taken th.it
a man should work eight hours and
be paid for ten.
Mr. Thom said In conclusion that if
part of the proposed legislation be en.
auted It all should be passed.
Kliott H. Goodwin, general secre
tary of the chamber of commerce of
the United States, was the first
speaker for the shippers. He said
a vote taken among more than seven
hundred commercial organizatloi r
showed them almost unanimously In
favor of submitting the present con
trover' to the Interstate commerce
commission.
Harvey , Barlow, traffic manager
for the Chicago Association of Com
merce, urged postponement of the
strike that congress might have time
to investigate fully.
Luther M. Walter, attorney for the
National Industrial Traffic league who
said he represented two hundred
thousand shippers and trade organiza
tions, objected to any proposal thet
looked. to an Increase In freight rates
without a hearing on the merits of
the proposal and how It may affett
the country. He said there was no
reason why employes of Industrial con
cerns should not make the same do.
mand and threaten to paralyse the
Industries of the country.
TIT FOR TAT IS
GERMAN METHOD
Will Treat Russian Prisoners Just as
German I'risoiK-rH aro
Treated.
BERLIN', Aug. SI. (Via wireless
to Sayville) "officers and sailors of
the Kussian navy prisoners la tier-
many, says the Overseas News
agency, "have been brought into a
reprisal camp because for more than
a year German naval officers and
sailors In Siberia have been treated
as common criminals.
"The Russians," the news agency
says, "will be treated exactly as are
the German prisoners in Russia until
Russia decides to treat the Germans
as sailors who did their duty for their
country.
"The Russian actions are said to
have been caused by the friendly ad
vice of F.ngland which declared that
the Germans were not regular sailors,
but pirates. All diplomatic negotia
tions were without result. The Kus
sian general staff even pretended that
proved facts were untrue and this
caused the German government to
adopt counter measures."
GUARDS WILL MEET
DELAY ON RETURN
Those Ordered Hack Can
Scarcely Make Trip by,
Next Week.
NO ROLLING STOCK
All Troops Will Not Return
to Their Own Mobiliza
tion Camps.
SAN ANTONIO, Aug. 31. National
guard regiments ordered to return
from the border scarcely will com
plete their movements northeast and
west before the end of next week and
perhaps not then, according to opin
ions expressed by the army men at
southern division headquarters to
night. It is necessary to scrape together
rolling stock from many distant points
before all the men can be entrained.
In some cases regiments can be rap
Idly entrained. In other there will
be much delay because trains to bear
the guardsmen to their destinations
must be brought from St. Louis, Chi.
cago, Houston and New Orleans. , .
The First and Second regiments of
tho First Illinois brigade, though they
will fare better than any other or
ganizations, will suffer from delay.
Scheduled to leave San Antonio to
night, they are not expected to get
away before tomorrow.
l)own on the border conditions are
even less favorable. The Third,
Fourth und Seventy-first New York
infantry in the Brownsville district
the First and Third Missouri inrantry
at Laredo, the Fourth Maryland In
fantry at Kaglc Pass, the First Louis
iana In the Brownsville district, and
the First and Fourth New Jersey in
fantry at New Mexico points, will not
(ret away before or until after the
hour when tho strike of the railway
trainmen is scheduled to begin. Tho
trip northward will occupy almost a
week, It Is estimated.
All the troops will not return to
their state mobilization camps. It Is
unueri-tood. In states where the fed
trul government possesses a rcserva
vatlon the guardsmen will station
there.
Men who, under the ruling of the
war department, have been dis
charged from tho service, will not
be affected by the movement.
They aro definitely out of the serv
ice arid will lot have to Join th'eir
organizations when they return to
their states.
Army men said tndy that there
is fool enough to feed the men on the
holder for sixty dnvs if the strike ma
terializes, but that forage would soon
be exhausted and It would be neces
sary to graze the army animals. Thore
have been frequent rains In Texas
lately and the grazing is good.
Get K.xlra Supplies.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 31. National
guard regiments and regular coast
artillery companies en route to or
from the border have been ordered
equipped with extra supplies for the
journey against the possibility that a
general railway strike will delay their
movements.
Secretary Bnker and other war de
partmcnt officials refused today to
discuss reports that the firteen thou
sand guardsmen suddenly ordered
northward last night were being
moved as a precaution against strike
violence. The states to which the
troops are returning are those where
only a small portion or tne guard was
not called Into the federal service and
In most of them large railway ter
minals are located.
Thirty Thousand Will Move.
Approximately thirty thousand
troops are under orders to move to or
from the border and many of them
will be en route on Monday morning,
the time set for the strike. Army
officials indicated today that If the
troop trains were caught In a tieup,
the men would detrain and make
camp at whatever point they are to
await Instructions. If congress does
not authorize the drafting of train
crews for military purposes, soldiers
might be used to run the trains. Every
regimental commander has the names
of the men under him who could drive
an engine or do trainmen's service If
an emrgency arose.
As long as the regiments ordered
north remain In the federal service
they are not subject to the call of
the governors of their states and their
participation In strike duty would
have to he on the same basis as regu
lar federal troops,

REFINERS SEEK
AID OF COURTS
TO FILL ORDERS
May Force Roads to Move
Gasoline liefore the
Strike Comes.
EMBARGO MEANS
LINES TO SUFFER
If Blow Falls All Refineries
in This Section May,
Close Down.
AltOl'SICI) at embarxos placed yes
terday on gasoline, refiners of
tho Mid-Continent field may go Into
federal court at Kansas City this
morning to force railroads leuding out
of T"K-i to accept and carry gaso
line consignments until the strike '
actually called.
I'nlw this plan is carried out or
some other means taken to remove
tho embargo tho entire southwest will
lie h imlicapped, as Its supply of oil
is obtained from local refiners. The
refiners planned to rush a huge re
serve to principal distributing points
before the strike was actually called
ind had counted upon two more days
of grace, at least.
I'ntil yesterday afternoor it w.-u,
thought that gasoline could be shipped
'"subject to indefinite deluy," the
druse which Is used by railroads for
all freight except perishable. Late
yesterday afternoon the Frisco and
M., K. & T. offices here received
orders to refuse ail gasoline after mid
night last night, thus cutting the re
finers two days short.
It was thcught that they would he
ivllllng to sh'n the gasoline until a
strike wis ca'led, even though the
railroad refuses to guarantee delivery.
The new ruling of the Frisco and
K itv trakos it Impossible to shin in
this manner.
It was at first thought that the
Santa Fe and Midland Valley would
take similar action but P. T.- Mc
Klrahau, local commercial agent of
the Santa Fe, announced last night
that his road had not declared an
embargo on gasoline, the shippers
being privileged to ship it subject to
Indefinite delay. The Midland Valley
Is expected to cut off the shipments
tonight.
lU-flners Get Busy.
Several leading refiners In this city
Immediately called an informal con
ference upon receipt of word of the
gasoline embargo and discussed plans
for securing a mandamus which would
compel the railroads to accept gaso
line as long as possible. Their de
cision was not given out.
The refiners base their claims upon
the fact that in case of a railroad
strike the country would fall back
upon automobile delivery for Im
mediate commercial needs. Owing to
recent congestion In the local yards,
Important cities In the southwest are
not well stocked with gasoline and are
absolutely dependent upon the Tulsa
lndust rices.
Although the reriners made a rush
upon tho railroad authorities yester
day, they were unable to get all their
shipments out and as a result their
output may be entirely inadequate to
'the demand.
An Indirect effect of the embargo
also would be that the refineries
would be forced to close down, as it
is estimated that they have tanks for
storing less than a week's output.
When the tanks are filled they would
close down and discontinue tho pur
chase of oil. With this move the oil
development would cease.
It is possible that the Santa Fe may
save the day by holding open its
freight doors to the oil men today, as
per tho announcement made last
night
lineal railroad men have ncthlng to
say in regard to the situation, as they
are dependent entirely upon orders
from headquarters.

Tho whole interest In the war
now is focused on tho llalkuns and
on the German field marshal, von
Hitidet'4urg. Rumania's participation
is consldired here important not only
from the accession of a fresh army,
out from the opportunity it nvm (In

to co-operate with Kuinanta on Gallc
lun and 1 ransvlvaiilan territory vir
tually us one army against the Aus
trlans Another Important factor Is the
closing of the Danube, the principal
routo for thu shipment of munitions
from Germany to Turkey und the
shipping of supplies to Germany.
Reports diffi-r ns to whether the
central powers wero ready for Ru
mania's entry. While Austrian offi
cial messages assert that Austria
Hungary was prepared, dispatches to
the newspapers said that the central
powers were so confident of Ru
mania's neutrality that they left the
boundary thinly guardeu and that
they are hurry g reinforcements
from everywhere, hile tho Inhabi
tants are fleeing panic-stricken before
the Rumanian advance.
The possibilities of llulgarla weak
ening and of the Greek people forcing
Hie government to mobilize and re
sist Bulgarian occupation of the ter
ritory In Greece so recently won from
Turkey are much discussed. King
Ferdinand of llulgarla Is visiting Vi
enna and English speculation is that
he fears to return to his kingdom and
is preparing to abdicate in favor of

HICKORY MINES
SWEPT BY FIRE
Damage to Powerhouse of
Company Last Night Es
timated at 10,0()0.
4 MILES FROM TULSA
Barrels of Oil Explode;
Powder Is Threatened;
Cause Unknown.
FIRE of unknown origin destroyed
tho powerhouse of the Hickory
coal mines, one mile south of Kendall,
last night. Property loss was esti
mated by officials of the oompany at
$10,000.
The fire was discovered at 8:10
o'clock in the evening by a group of
employes, who were seuted on tho
front porch of a home about 150
yards distant. Flames arising from
tho top of the building brought their
uttentlon.
Henry Adamson, mine foreman and
stockholder in the company, wus the
first to reach tho building. Tearing
open the doors he and others were
blown back from tho entrance by a
terrific blast of heut which issued as
from a furnace.
The entire Interior of the building
was in flames. The most acute con
dition was in the west of the build
ing, where the huge boilers were sta
tioned. Tho fire seemed to be on the
celling and walls more than on the
floor. .-
It was impossible to enter the build
ing and volunteers from the mining
city fell to irttcctinr other property.
Tic mine proper with Its Intricate
f.ciirfolUing and runways was less than
fifty feet from the building and no
hope was entertained for it at first
gluncc.
As soon as the fire broke from the
building, however. It wus noticed that
a strong south wind was whipping the
flnmcF away from tho mine and a part
of the volunteer corps was directed to
the other side of the ennlno house.
Suve Frame Itiitlilliigs,
One frame dwelling house was only
a hundred feet distant from the house
and burning' cinders began to fail
upon the roof. All furnishings were
removed from the home and th- ac
(Upants sat back to watch It burn. If
It had caught fire, there is little doubt
that the entire string of company
licuses. more than a dozen In number,
would have burned as they are In a
row on either side of one street. .
Efforts of the volunteers, how
ever, kept the cinders from selling
fire to the dwelling and thus confined
the lire to the powerhouse.
The powerhouse was constructed of
coTugntod sheetlron with frcme sup
ports. Within half an hour after the
discovery of the fire the entire struc
ture collapsed and the danger was
jver.
About this time several barrels or
oil which were stored In the house
rypioiled ana spread fear among the
Inhabitants f f the mining village. A
pwoderh.iuie of the company Is situ
ated about two hundred yards of the
powerhouse nnd It was thought th.it
sparks had reached this.
Hefrre an hour had pa-sscd the ex

WITH food prices rising hourly
and railroad embargoes tight
ening all along the line, Tulsa sits on
an economic volcano today, anxiously
waiting for the lid to blow off. Com
plications came thick and fast during
the day ami the entire city traveled
at an excited pace.
Housewives read tho latest news
and began laying In supplies for the
next month. Grocers exhausted ;i.fr
supplies and the wholesale houses did
the biggest duy's business in history.
At various times during the day prlees
on commodities advanced as the sup
ply began to run low.
At a late hour In the nfternoon tlia
two express companies posted em
bargoes on all perishable express to
become effective Immediately. This
cuts off all shipments of butter and
eggs to the city. The supply which Is
obtained almost entirely from the out
side Is sufficient for only three days.
Although some of the largest retail
groceries held their food prices to the
usual schedule yesterday, the smaller
dealers grew flighty at the new quo
tations of wholesalers nnd made gen
eral advances during the day.
Potatoes advanced 45 cents a bushel
at wholesale, sending the retail price
up to $3 a bushel. The supply of this
commodity is almost exhausted and
frenzied efforts of dealers to secure
shipments yesterday before the em
bargoes became effective failed.
Neither Chicago nor Kansas City
could supply spuds yesterday. Further
raise In prices Is expected.
All fruits are fast becoming luxuries.
Oranges and lemons Jumped $1 a box
at wholesale yesterday. There is a
good supply of apples In the city.
Vrk'ea Advance.
All vegetables are supplied by for
eign markets and prices began to ad
vance yesterday. Cabbage and onions
both went up V4 cent a pound whole
salo. Tomatoes ure largely homo
grown. Although dealers expected to get
tn shipments by express, eggs and
butter Jumped at various coalers.
With the announcement of the em
bargo by express companies the deal
ers said that they expected a raise in
both butter and eggs today.
There Is no cold storage plant in
the city and egrs and butter on hand
wi'l not l.ist more than three days,
nceordinn to estimates by dealers. One
of the lap-rest produce concerns Is fx-''.
peeling a carload feggs by tod;y'i
freight, but it Is doubtful whether he
v 111 receive it. In case of Its arHvI
there will be enough eggs for a week.
Cured meats have been advancing
d :i 11 v and no quotations are made per
manent bv dealers. Less than a
v.erk's supply Is on hand.
