Congressional Leaders Framing A
Railroad
til
Brotherhood Leaders Say
ter Rests With Railroads
Washington, Aug. 31. House Lead
cr Kitchen and Chairman Adamson of
the house interstate commerce com
mittee, framed legislation which they
believe will avert the threatened rail
road strike. In effect it would pro-"
Yido by law almost exactly the term"
of settlement which the president of
fored the brotherhoods and the i all
rood presidents, and which the broth
erhoods accepted. The legislation
takes the form of a bill fixing ao
eight hour day for work on railroads
with time and one-half for overtime
Doing more drastic in tho last respect
than the president's proposal and
providing a commission of three to re
port to congrpss on further legislation.
All the Influence of the administra
tion was brought to bear In an effort
to persuade the railroad brotherhood
leaders to cancel or postpone tho or
der calling a nation-wide strike Mon
day, while leaders in congress began
paving the way for legislation design
ed to preent or stop the threatened
industrial catastrophe. Little tangible
progress wps made In either direction,

But, nevertheless, in official quarters
fbere Btlll prevailed confidence that In
oho way or anotfcor the walkout would
be averted.
To tho spokesmen of President Wll
bob, who approached thorn, all of the
brotherhood ofBciala give the same re
ply; that they had no power to recall
tho strike order and that only one
thing "a satisfactory settlement"
could keep their men at work after 7
a. m. Labor day. Further pressure
will be brought to hear, and as a last
resort tho president la considering a

or board. This embodies the prlnclpa'
fpatures of the president's original
plan, accepted by the trainmen. W.
G. Lee, head of the trainmen, said
that its enactment', with a guarantee
of the present rate of dally pay would
be regarded by, the brotherhood lead
ers as a "witlsfnctory settlement."'
Immediately upon its becoming a law,
he said, the brotherhood leaders
would send out the code message noti
fying general chairmen that the strike
order should not go Into eifect.
Even some of the congressional
leaders, who oppose other features of
the program, say such a law could bp
passed. '
One dominant thought In the mind?
of members of congress generally re
sulted in the Introduction of a resolu
tion by Senator Blair Leo of Maryland
calling upon officials of the railroad
brotherhoods to postpone execution of
the strike order for one week to give
congress sufficient time for intelligent
consideration of legislation suggested
in President Wilson's message. Tho
resolution was referred to the Inter
stato commerce committee without
discussion.
Opinion in the senate after the gen
eral debate concentrated on the urg
ent necessity for emergency action
first, proposals for permanent legis
lation to be considered thoroughly
after danger of nn Immediate tie-up
had been passed. Tills sentiment was
forcibly expressed on the floor and
echoed in conferences of .house lead-
Effect of Threatened Strike.
Toledo, Aug. 31. Consumers began
to feel the effect of the threatened
railroad strike. Potatoes leaped 25
cents on the barrel to $4. Produce
dealers say stocks will not last over
four days if shipments are shut off.
Packers nlso fear a close down of
their plants as stocks of meat aro
small, owing to big demand made for
pmoked products during the long hot

Flour Mills Would Close.
Minneapolis, Minn. Aug. 31. Every
flour mill in Minneapolis will be clos
ed thirty minutes after the order for
a nation-wide railroad strlko becomes
effective, according to an announce

mills in the city are filled to capacity
with no available storage space and
no way In which to move tho output.

Washington, Aug. 31 Proposed in

..Following the secret order of the

Fighting Raging In the Macedonian

London, Aug. 31. An official state
ment given out by the Roumanian
war office declares that the Rouma
nian troops have made progress ir.
their crossing of the Austro-HUD-garian
frontier and have reached ser
ral points, including a village cast of
Kronstadt. More than 750 prisoners
have already been taken.
On the Danube, from the Iron Gate
to Gurgevo. opposite Rustchuk, Bul
garia, there have been reciprocal bom
bardments at several points by Aus
tro-Hungarian war craft and Rouma
nian shore batteries. A Zeppelin and
t. hostile aeroplane have dropped
bombs on the Roumanian capital.
Austria's acknowledgment of the re
tlrement of her forces in the moun
tainous region to previously prepared
positions in the rear has been follow
ed by claims by Roumania that tna
troops of King Ferdinand have arriv
ed at a point within three miles ot
Kronstadt the chief commercial city
of Transylvania. Vienna admits that
the Roumanians are engaged with tho
Austro-Hungarians In the Gyergo
mountains, which show that off the
northwestern front of Roumania hos
tile forces have invadpd Transylvania
some twenty-five miles. The Rouma
nians are also near Koedzi-Vasarhely,
about forty miles northeast of Kron
stadt.
While Bulgaria has not entered into
the hostilities against Roumania, a
news agency says Roumania haa de
cided to send an ultimatum to Bul
garia demanding the evacuation of
Serbia. A dispatch from Constantino
ple reports that Turkey has declared
war on Roumania.
In the Macedonian theater violent
fighting continues between the en
tente allies and the Austro-Gennana
and the Bulgarians. Claims are made
that to the west of Vardar river the
French have gained additional ground
and that in the Lake Ostrovo region
the Serbs have repulsed attacks by
the Bulgarians. Drama, in northeast
Greece, has been seized by the Bul
garians, after a fight with Gieek
troops, according to unofficial advices
received in Paris.
Except for an extension of the Brit
ish lines south of Martinpulca on the
Somme front in France, there has
been little activity, except by artil
lery, on the part of any ot the bellig
erents in the western battle line. Like
wise, on the front in Russia and Gall
cla, there have been no important
changes in positions.

On the Situation.
Chicago, Aug. 31. Railroadc
throughout tho country aro gathering;
their forces to oppose the strike set.
for Monday
The undercurrent of feeling report
ed at Washington that the catastrophe
would yet be averted was not reflect
ed here among railroad men. A sum
mary of the situation made by E. P
Ripley, president of the Atchison. Tc
poka and Santa Fe, who was a mem
ber of the committee which conferred
with President Wilson, as spokesman
for railroad presidents who returned
from the conferences at the national
capital, intensified the pessimism felt
here. Mr. Ripley asserted that the
railroads can now Fee no hope of ai
settlement before Labor day and aro
making every preparation for eventu
alities. Practically every important railroad:
In the country has given notice of em
bargoes. They affect perishable
freight and live stock, which at pres
ent constitute about one-third of the
freight traffic on moat western. zsad,
and passengers. Agents everywhere'
were instnicted to warn passengers:
of probable delays and not to accept
any perishable freight which could"
not normally be delivered before Sept.
4. In some cases the date was sot for
Saturday or Sunday.
Mr Ripley's face had fight writtens
all over it as he worked his broad,
shoulders through the crowd at tha
station, and the expression translated:
Itself into words in his subsequent
statements.
He gave out three statements. Ths-
first statement was issued formally as
the expression of the party which re
turned from Washington; the second
was addressed to employes of tho San
ta Fe and warned those who might
obey ihe strike order that they would
lose all rights of seniority and of ben
efits from insurance and pension
funds. The third was Mr. Ripley's
pn for meeting the strike and an
analysis of the railroads' side of the.
contro ersy
There was some differenco of opin
ion, he said, among the officials when
they first arrived at Washington as to
what course to pursue, but they bo
came absolutely unanimous when re
quested to abandon arbitration. They
were for it, he said. On the import
ant subject of what the rdTTds purpose
to do he a!d that attempts would be
made to keep at least one passenger
train on each run and that prefer -ence
woidd next be given perishable
