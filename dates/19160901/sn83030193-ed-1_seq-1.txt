Into n conspiracy. These men are re

"I llleve that the rise In tho price
of most foodstuffs, as In tho case of

reason that . II dealers In foods

some sort of a secret or Implied 'un
derstanding as to what tho new price
will lie. Therefore. It does not require
very much Imagination, to arrive at
the conclusion thnt a conspiracy 'must
exist anions a combination ot food
distributers.
STATE LAW COVERS THE OF
FENac. "There Is an anti-trust law In this
Stnte. which fixes ienaltles for un
lawful combinations. Tho strength of
this law the Donnelly Act will bo In

of unlawful rise In food prices Is found.
"When tho wholesale poultry dealers

give them nn opportunity to Justify

can't I will proceed with tho evidence
I already have and thnt which I may
