who assisted her. Chaplain and
Mrs. Vincent deserve mention
for their assistance In the ar
rangements. Mrs. Prince ar
rived here Saturday afternoon
from Deming, accompanied by
W. E. Holt and Misses Holt and
Torrlll. She was entertained at
the home of Mayor Dabney. She
returned U Doming Sunday even-
inn, and will snend a few days
at Fnywood before returning
home.
It was impossible for all those
who were present to hear Mrs.
Prince's remarks, and her ad
dress is published In full.
Mrs. Prince said:
This moment marks the culmi
nation of the thoughts, the hopes
and the efforts, which have tilled
the period since my heart was
touched by the relation of events
of the night, or early morning, of
the ninth of March that never
to be forgotton reign of terror
here, in what is now the peace
ful little city of Columbus.
A chilv.il roils spirit was
aroused, and I determined that
recognition in some form ahould
be given to this brave woman,
who, altho alone with her little
child, did not cry for help, did
not leave the house and desert
her duty at the telephone; who
had the forethought not to light a
lamp, nor, in fact, to make a sign
nor a sound of any kind, which
might attract the wild and savage
bandits, bent only on theft, arson,
murder and all other crimes of
bestial diameter.
Weeks passed, and ran into
months, before my purpose was
ucooiopllsJiyd. M
Being in New York at that time,
well-nigh 3,000 miles away from
the scenes which have made Co
luinbus famous, and "far from
wars alarm," it seemed as if it
miglit t-e an uncertain effort on
my part; but through the exer
cise of dilligence and Uict. pleas
ant words and smiles, frieuds
rallied to my assistance but the
entire story will be written later,
and those who care to know the
sequence of events which made
it possible for me to be htre to
day, may read for themselves.
The main thing is that we are
assembled to do honor to this
brave American girl!
I have b. ought a substantial
recognition of her heroism and I
have come that it might be pre
sented to her here on the very
scene of her devotion to all of her
townspeople in endeavoring to
summon aid.
So this U intended, not only as
a tribute to tier, but as an atten
tion to the entire city of Colum
bus, which suffered so terribly
at the hands of that border
rufiian, Francisco Villa, and his
bandits.
But we must also remember
that we are here to render

Labor Day Proclamation
The spirit of the age demands
Imprdved conditions for the
laborer. Only by patience and
cure and serious thoughtfulness
can this be accomplished.
In theory we stand for equal
rights while in fact we have ex
alted wealth and given undue
consideration to its power. The
vested rights of capital must be
second-to the rights of man and
the welfare of the millions who
struggle for a fair living for
themselves and their families.
It has been thought wise and
just to set aside oue day in each
year out of consideration for all
who labor.
Now Therefore, iu pursuance
of the law and custom, 1, William
C. McDonald, Governor of the
State of Now Mexico, do hereby
proclaim: Monday, the 4th day
of September, 1910, as Labor Day
and request that all public and
private business be suspended
so far as practicable in order that
this may be made a real holiday.
I want to urge all good and
true citizens, particularly those
who labor, to avoid ignoble things
and strive only for that which is
good for themselves and tiue
tor whom they are responsible

COLUMBUS,

RIGHT HERE AT HOME
Up In tht Air Almost Four Tentf
Would Water U. S. Army
The Carl-Poole well southeast
of town would furnish the U. S
army with water and then have
some to spare, according to the
tlgures given by J. R. Blair.
This well supplies 3,500 gallons
of water pur minute, or 210,000
gallons an hour, and 5,040,000
gallons every twenty-four hours.
The amount of water required
for. all purposes , for, each man
every day is 25 gallons, accord
ing to the army officers. At
that rate this big well would
supply 201,000 men with all the
water needed.
The Carl-Poole well is the
largest in the Mimbres Valley,
and possibly the largest in the
southwest. The Bailey well,
located only a short distance
from this well, has a capacity of
1,800 gallons per minute. The
Hallock well, less than one mile
away, delivers 2,000 gallons, and
the Pierce well is as large as the
Hallock well. There are sevpral
other large wells in the valley,
but those mentioned above are
the largest. The lift to the sur
face is not over eight feet in
either of the four big wells.
In the north end of the valley
the best wells do not furnisli
over ,vw gallons or tne ny.uy
per minute. The water has to
be lifted several feet, and the
expense of pumping is much
larger than in this end of the
valley.
The report which it seems has
been circulated from Deming
and the north end of tiie valley
that we had no water here is not
only false, but sounds ridicu
lous to those who are acquainted
witli the conditions that really
exist.
The wells that the government
has drilled did not come up to
their expectations, but there is
a supply of over 100 gallons per
minute on the new cam)) site,
and no doubt this will bo greatly
Increased as soon as larger
pumps are installed. The Hul
sey well from the first has been
pumped to the full capacity of
the plant.

No. 11
Columbus Must
Clean Up At Once
Meeting Held at Crystal Theatre
Tuesday Afternoon Attended by
Doctors and Business Men of
Columbus to Agree Upon Some
System for Combating Filth.
The meeting called by tho
mayor, held attheCrvstalTheatre
Tuesday1, was attended by sev
eral of the army doctors and a
few of the business men of the
town. Mayor Dabney presided,
and Colonel Friok was asked to
state the object of the meeting.
He read a letter from tho dis
trict sanitary inspector, which
suggested a plan for cleaning up
the town, Several of his sug
gestions will be put into effect,
one of which requires everyone
to get a garbage can with a
cover, which will be emptied as
often as necessary by the vil
lage. Colonel Frick stated that the
military would co operate with
the village authorities, and was
ready to help in any way
possible.
Ordinance No. 5 passed by the
Board of Trustees of the Village
of Columbus in 1913 was read.
If the provisions of this ordi
nance had been enforced it
would not be necessary to such
action to be taken as will now
have to be. It provides a line for
throwing or sweeping paper or
any kind of refuse into the
streets. There are some of our
leading business people who
make this a practice every day.
The mayor has ordered the mar
shal to enforce every provision of
the ordinance, and those who
violate it now will be punished
regardless of who they are.
Columbus must be cleaned up,
and that at once. Order after
order has been issued, with a
large part of the people paying
little or no attention at all.
Everybody has been given a
chance to do the right thing, and
have been waiting on someone
else o' just did not dare. The
marshal now lias orders to in
spect all toilets and back yards
in town, and those whose prem
ises are in an unsanitary condi
tion will be taken into police
court and given an opportunity
to explain to Judge Peach.
Some of the business people
who have been here for a long
time evidently think that the
clean-up order is not intended
for them, but for those who have
recently come in. Some seem
to imagine that they have pull
enough that they can get by
without obeying at all if they do
not care to. The Courier is
anxious to have the town clean,
and next week when the marshal
makes his inspection all who
have not complied with the laws
will be taken into police court,
and the Courier will certainly
inform its readers who they
are.
