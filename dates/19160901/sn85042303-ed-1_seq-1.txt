NO WAY TO ESTIMATE THE VAST
BENEFITS THAT WILL COME
TO CROPS AND TO LIVE STOCK
AFTER NICE RAIN.
Following the serret ordi r of the
railroad brotherhoods calling for a
strike on Sept. 4, the railroad man
agers and executives increased their
defiance of conceding the eight-hour
day with ten houri' pay to their men.
Every last executive claimed It would
be confiscation to adopt a scheme
which they say will cost the railroads
$50,000,000 more a year. Congression
al Interference was held out by Presi
dent Wilson as the last resort. The
only basis 011 which the railroad man
agers from the start would consider at
all the eight-hour day proposition of
their employees was with an Increase
in the freight rate which would offset
the salary Increase. The railroad
managers who have been In confer
ence with the president at various
times during the crls-is are shown

Tlie value of the '4.S0 inches of rain
which fell Thursday night cn '
scarcely be estimated In dollars ana
cents. The grass was getting dry
on the ranges, cattle were beginning
to look a little drawn, stock water
was getting scarce nnd cotton was
suffering from dry weather. It was
the first ruin of any consequence
since the 27th day of June. Showers
fell during July und August that kept
cotton In some localities doing rea
sonably well, but it is the rtrst good
wetting the land has had since June.
It means that the pasture lands will
gruw a big fall crop of grass, the
stalk fields will make good pastures
this winter, late cane and kaffir will
make a big lot of feed and stock
water will he plentum.
Now us to cotton, that's where we
are interested most. In speaking of
the conditions that prevail .now let
us quote Hubert F. Sclvally because
there Is not a better authority In the
county. Mr. Sclvally says that la
1911 the summer was very similar to
the one this year. That a rain came
on the 3rd of September and farmers
were picking cotton In some of the
fields until March. A big crop was
raised that year. In this good year
there have been showers to hold up
Ilia cotton, there are some fluids that
the rain cannot help very much tut
they are few. The greater portion
of the cotton acreage will take on
new growth, the fruit on the cotton
now will be brought to full maturity
and thcr Is time ; et for the cotton to
fruit and mature that fruit It means
a big top crop, tt means a good cotton
crop, it means that the farmers will
make money and tt means that trade
will be active all through the fall and
winter.

THE RAIN DID NOT
DAMPEN THE SPIRIT
The rain came and with It
Increased optimism. The boost
ers' banquet was postponed
until tonight so that the boost
ers could be thoroughly satu
rated with all th.u the rain
brought from the heavens.
Scores braved the elements
and went "loaded to the
muzzle" but all agreed that
rain was better than "eats"
ftnd they decided to convert
the affair into a double cele
bration tonight.
The affair will be at'ended
by all ranks of Ardmore citi
zenship. With the oil men,
the capitalists, merchants and
professional men will be seated
representatives of every branch
of industry, all of whom have
entered the boosting game In
spirit ard in deed.
No man with the futur? ot
Ardmore at heart will be ab
sent from the banquet tonight
except those absent from the
city or with a very good and
justifiable txcuse. . .
