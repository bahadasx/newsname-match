The division of the levy for corpor-
aliou purposes is as follows: Hun

fund 4.70 mills.
Last year the expense of the School
sinking fund was $4777.10, and their

for $4873.77.
The total property valuation of the
school district Is $4,726,1 50, and ac
cording to the mill levy as fixed by
the Budget Commission, which is one
mill, the schools will derive $4,826.15
for sinking fund purposes.
Last year's corporation sinking
fund expense was $39,975, and their
askings In the budget this year was
$40,000.
The total property value of the cor

necessary to take care of the bonds
anil interest coining due, while the
school board derive? almost tbo nee
essary amowt to Cr-re for their in
debtedness.
In the i '.'it oral luunln.- account
funds this yt-o th" school bo'i-d ask
ed for $18,000 in their tuition fund
while their expense in this fund last
year was only $16210, or an increase
of $1790 ovci last year. In their
contingent fund they this year ask
for $7600, while their expense last
year only ran $6105.77 or an Increase
of $1494.23, making a total Increase
over last year's expense of $3284.23
In addition to this their budget re
port sohws that at the end of the

to this the school board receives an
nually about $2300, or a little better,
state aid, and about $4,000, as out

this their balances in the two funds
of $2275, and they have a total of
$25,466, or only about $150 less than
they claim is necessary to carry on
the present arranged school program.
Against this is the corporation s
condition which shows an asking
through the budget as follows, to

and fund conditions at the end of the
current year.

These figures show that the In
crease In the present budget of the
corporation is only about $100 more
than the expense of last year.
Under the present levy of the Bud
get Commission the corporation re
ceives the following amounts, based
upon the corporation tax valuation,
which Is $4,569,760.00.
Mill levy money
General 85 3655.81
Health 10 r 456.00

This makes a total levy of 1.95
mills or in money $8,910.06. To
this can be added $3418.26 liquor col
lections, which makes a grand total
of $12,328.32, which is $3,767.54 less
than the amount of mnoey expended
to run the corporation affairs the past
year. Add to this the deficit in tne
funds at the end of the current year,
$2,544, and the corporaion has a
grand shortage of funds totalling
, $6,311.
Despite these figures the Board of
Education is claiming the corporation
is getting more than their share of
money, and they must sell bonds to
keep going.
If they are short of funds as they
maintain it cost $22,933.11 plus what
ever money was obtained from out
side tuition, estimated at $4,00, or
$26,933.11, to run the schools last
year, which, according to Auditor
Steinbrunner does not include the
salary of Superintendent Pogwe which
is $2100.

Intimated a Further Reduction of
Saloons May Soon Be Law
Annual Work Begun.
Th ( regular period for making ap
plication for saloon licenses and re
newals for saloon licenses for the li
cense year 1916-17 Is from Septem
ber 1st. to September 1 Gib.
An appicatlon fee of $5.00 must
he paid by each applicant ana there
after a registration fee of $100 is re
i uired to be paid by each successful
applicant.
The application blanks are to be
obtained at the office of the Mercer
county liquor licensing ooard In this
city or from either of the members
of the board.
All applications for saloon licenses
tiled with the board between Septem
ber 1st and after September iGth are
considered by the board about the
middle of October. Any application
made after September 15 is not con
sidered until after the beginning of
the license year, the fourth Monday in
November.
The state board recently sent out
in order to all county boards in
which notice was given of a court
decision to the effect that the county
boards have arbitrary authority over
licenses and that they may refuse to
giant renewals on evidence that sat
isfies the members of the board of
violations of the licensing laws. The
county hoard Is not required to pre
sent its evidence at any hearing on
appeal but presents It to the state
board. Persons who have knowledge
of the violation of the liquor licens
ing laws by saloon keepers may with
perfect propriety report the same to
county boards without fear of being
revealed as Informants.
On good authority it is reported
that Governor Willis favors the fur
ther restriction of the saloon busi
ness, making tne limit on saloon io
000 people in wet territory. That
this law will be passed at the coni
ng session of the legislature, wheth
er Governor Willis or Jas. m. vox is
elected governor, is believed certain
and with thi sldea In view the coun
ty boards will probably eliminate a
number of undesirable saloons and
put men out of the business who were
never entitled ti licenses and after a
rial have proved themselves improp
er persons to be in the traffic.

heat of the 2:12 pace, but met with
a mishap in the second mile and a
broken hip was reported as the cause
of aer being distanced.
Billy Arlington belongs to Pat
King, of near Mercer, and was driv
en by Bill Goggin.
Goggin also drove Little Bess and
finished third in the first heat, with
a field of fourteen starters. Ou the
home etretch in the second heat, she
broke her left hind leg, and it is be
lieved they will have to kill the lit
tle mare.
Little Bess started in the 2:12 pace
on Friday of the Banner Fair. She
