TRANSPORTATION CRISIS
Bosiness To Be Paralyzed by
Strike. Trainmen Walk Out
Monday. Congress Acting
If the strike ordered by the
unions for Monday takes effect,
all business in this country will
be at a practical stand still and
exporting halted. The various
trainmen's orders have demand
ed an 8 hour day and time and a
half for overtime, and the presi
dents of all the roads affected
have positively refused to accede
to the demand, the result being
that an inminent prospect for a
general paralysis of business
will be felt in every direction
next week unless congress, thru
the heroic efforts of President
Wilson does something to avert
it before Monday. It was thot
that President Wilson had check
ed the threatened calamity until
an agreement could be reached
satisfactory to the owners of the
railroads and the workmen, but
like a holt out of a clear sky, the
order for the general strike flash
ed over the country.
Railroads are refusing freight
and stock yards are being over
crowded with stuff which cannot
possibly get out if the strike is
on, and consequent sacrifice of
the stock is inevitable.
Congress is working overtime
'.to pass a law which will take
effect before Monday, but the
president's proposals are meet
ing with much opposition. It
may be that the government will
be forced to take over the man
agement of the railroads if con
gress ties up on the questions be
fore it. - President Wilson has
determinedjto head of f . the cal-
amity ' in some way, and that
means that it will be done or be
of very short duration.
As important feature of a
strike as any other is the inabil
ity to get food and other supplies
to the army in and about Mexico.
That army must be fed and with
the transportation lines out of
business it is impossible.
Railroad managers believe that
the moving of a limited number
of trains can be effected if the
strike goes on, but the allied and
sympathetic organizations of
railroad employees such as freight
handlers, yard and switch men
etc. may cut out hope of moving
any trains whatever.
The situation in a nut shell
is, that the railroads have been
dickering with their employees
until the latter have got tired
waiting for action and have made
demands which the railroads
claim cannot be met and allow
them to exist. The proposition
that they might increase their
rates to meet the demands ap
pears to have been to no effect
The orders of railway train-men
precipitated action by declaring
a strike which would take out of
service at least a half million
men and tie up all the main road
of the country; The voting on
this strike question was months
4n being taken and the managers
of therailroads knewtif its exis
tence and the result long before
i the final declaration of the lead-
. i? erf of the various orders. When
f the strike was declared, Presi
dent Wilson asked for a confer
erence with the leaders of both
'the stikers and the managers of
the railroads. He had the strik
ers calmed until the presidents of
the 'roads refused such action
as would have settled the matter.
The stike was declared for
Monday and President Wilson
, turned the question over to con
for action. Congress is at it day
. and night to reach a conclusion
and act. - v-. '

City Wednesday.
Few Disagree With Us j
, There was exception taken.to
our comments on the Jones chau
tauqua numbers which appeard
to us, and we might add to a
majority of those who heard
them, as being unworthy, and to
hand it back to us, a few of the
members of the commercial club,
to be exact, a dozen out of 62,
met and resolved that we were
wrong as will appear from the
resolution printed below. The
numbers commented on ad
versely were found fault with in
some particular or another, if
not to the whole subject. The
numbers we praised werer so far
as we can learn by interviewing a
great many, highly appreciated.
Blankes lecture, if such it might
be called, is held by many we
have heard express their views
of it, unfit for public utterance
and we took their, views on this
as well as on the Farham and
Cairns lectures, not having heard
them ourself.
The one great idea which
prompts the editor of the Courier
to write up matters as he sees
them or as he hears them dis
cussed by those who know some
thing about them, is to get the
facts before the public, as he
knows or believe the facts to be.
Every lecturer, actor or musi
cian and chautauqua promoter
and others before the public,
clip and use from newspapers
favorable comment, and if such
endorsements have been given
without regard to the merit of the
individual, some other commun
ity will be imposed upoa by the
use of such articles. No indiffer
ent show, performer or promoter
will get away with anything to
his advantage appearing about
him in the Courier; likewise nn
worthy aspirants for public office
With this explanation on our
part, you may proceed to read
the resolution in the records of
the commercial club, as follows;
'The following resolution was
offered and accepted at the meet
ing of the Commercial Club.
Be it resolved by the Keytes
ville Commercial Club that the
recent criticisms of our chautau
qua. that appeared in the two
last issues of the Chariton Cour
ier did not express the eentiment
of the Commercial Club nor of
the citizens of Keytesville and
community but were merely the
sentiments of a few people who
have always been opposed to our
Chautauqua. The citizens of
Keytesville and Commercial Club
were well pleased with our Chau
tauqua and think the money
it c jst us was well spent. It is
true that we lost some money,
but if we had had the hearty
support of the entire community
that we were entitled to we
would have made money for the
jrood road fund."
' "The sentiment of a few peo
Je" and "the hearty support of
the entire community" in the
above appear to be contradictory
but let it go as it is. '

Senatorial Matter .
If any one knows just how
the successor of Senator John S.
Wallace will be selected, he has
kept it to himself, but we believe
that a primary or delegated con
vention will have to name the
man who will appear on the bal
lot Nov. 6. Undoubtedly as
many as have aspiration that
way may get in the race.
Committee Meeting
The County Committee will
meet here next Wednesday, Sep
tember 6. There should be a
full attendance. Arrangements
for a big Campaign in the Coun
ty should be made and nominees
set to work after respectable
majorities.
Kelly Pool takes his defeat
too hard, and has said things in
explanation of it which he had
no right as a party man or
Christian to utter. If the Knight's
of Columbus did support John L.
Sullivan, Kelly Pool has as little
right to complain of their action
as Sullivan might in answer by
criticising the support Pool
sought and got from the Christian
church. . .
Another thing Mr. Pool refers
to should have been left unsaid
and that is that the wets
supported Sullivan. If so and
the wets and dry line was drawn
in Pettis county and several oth
er places the tate of the prohibi
tion amendment can be easily
foretold.
Mr. Pool received many wet
votes of which we know and
doubtless Sullivan got many of
the dry element. Mr. Pool
got many catholic votes and
Mr. Sullivan undoubtedly many
prctestant, but it was a democrat
ic primary, not a wet and dry
fight nor a church affair and Mr.
Pool should have made no insua
tions, much less "undemocratic
noise about his defeat

Four More Countries Fighting.
The Balkan States Mix.
Germany Spreads.
Italy formally declared war on
Germany last week, and this
weeks opened with Roumania,
Bulgaria, Servia and Greece tak
ing an active part in the fighting.
Russia has joined Roumania and
invaded Austria, the main thing
desired being the liberation of
the wheat in Russia for the use
of the Allies.
Germany has sent an army to
the assistance of Austria and the
main seat of war has been divid
ed between Verdun in France
and the Balkans.
The situation around Verdun
is little changed from last week.
If the strike goes into effect on
the railroads Monday, the Allies
will suffer untold inconveniences
if not such a condition as will
place them at great disadvantage
in the strife.
G. A. R. at Kansas City
There are more than 18000 vets
of the civil war in Kansas City
this week celebrating the golden
anniversary of the organization.
It is estimated that there are as
many more visitors. Many are
present who are barely able to
get about, but it was their last
chance to assemble with old com
rades and thev took it It
was proposed by some good Sa
manitan that all automobiles
owned privately and having a va
cant seat, pick up any old soldier
met with who was walking to his
boarding house or anywhere else
and take him there. Hospitality
could not reach-farther.

Nat Talmage, chauffeur for
H. Kendell and not only a first
class driver, but a mechanician
who understands motor cars
thoroughly, had the misfortune
Monday morning to strike him
self on the nose with the crank.
The Franklin car did not res
pond at once to the self starter
and Nat got out to give her a
twist with the crank, with the
result that the crank slipped off
and twirled in his hand, the
other end smashing his nose. It
was fully expected that he would
say something by the ladies in
the car and they stopped their
ears A local surgeon straight
ened the nose out and bandaged
it so it would be straight when
exposed to the view of Nats
friends down south, who other
wise might fancy that it had
come in contact with a Missouri
