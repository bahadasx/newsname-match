SISTER ROSE
INSTANTLY KILLED
Terrible Accident on Waha
Grade Caused Death of Be
loved Nun and Injury of
Three Others and Driver.
This community was shocker
beyond measure Monday wher
news was flashed in over th(
wire that an auto containing foui
Sisters from the convent south
west of town had gone over th(
Waha grade and at least one ol
the Sisters was dead and the
others badly injured. The news
of the accident was received here
by telephone from Waha shortlj
after noon and the first message
was followed by others within f>
short time stating that physi
cians and an ambulance had left
for the scene from Lewiston and
the injured would be taken toth<
hospital at that place. Mother
Hildegard and one of the Sisters
at once left with John Meyer by
auto for Waha but arrived there
shortly after the ambulance had
left for the hospital with its last
load and so went on to Lewiston.
The auto party which sustained
the fatal accident left this place
about eight o'clock Monday morn
ing and its personnel consisted of
William Hordemann, driver, a
man of 67 years of age, Sisters
Augustine, Anastasia and Patri
cia, who were assigned to teach
in the Catholic parochial school
at Genesee, and Sister Mary Rose,
who was going to Colton to as
sume her duties as one of the
principal instructors in the Cath
olic academy at that place. Mr.
Hordemann had come here from
Genesee to take the teachers to
that place. The party reached
the Waha grade about noon. The
details of the accident as told in
Tuesday's issue of the Lewiston
Tribune follow:
"Just what happened on the
grade will probably never be
known further than Mr. Herdi
man was unable to descend the
hill at a safe speed and when
cautioned by the sisters seemed
to completely lose control of the
car and it plunged over the em
bankment.
"The accident happened at a
point about two miles above the
Waha postoffice and about a mile
below the water tank. It is a
rough rocky place where the road
makes a sharp turn to the right
and instead of making the turn
the car held a straight course
and went over the embankment.
The car turned several times
over and lodged against some
trees about 40 feet below the
road.
"The body of Sister Mary Rose
was found beneath the car. The
other sisters and Mr. Herdiman
were thrown onto the rocks and
stunned. They had not regained
consciousness when Ben Reeves
and wife, returning to their
camp south of Forest discovered
the inj ured ones and the body of
Sister Mary Rose.
"Mr. and Mrs. Reeves at once
commenced the work of rescue
but another car arrived before
they had assisted the injured to
the road and within a short time
all were loaded into cars and
taken to the Harnes & Wallace
hotel at Waha, where first aid
remedies were administered.
Messages were sent to Cotton
wood and Lewiston and early in
the afternoon Coroner Vassar
and Drs. F. P. Nourse and O. C.
Carssow were enroute to the
scene of the accident.
"Temporary dressings were
provided for the injuries and the
three injured sisters were
brought to St Joseph's hospital
late io the afternoon. The am
bulance then returned to the 1 ike
to sedüre Mr. Herdiman, and the
body of Sister Mary Rose was
brought to the city in an auto
hearse.
"An examination of the auto
mobile and the road above the
point where the car left the
grade shows that the brakes
of the machine were working
perfectly, as the wheels were
locked for at least 40 feet before
the car left the road. It is stated
Mr. Herdiman is an inexperi
enced driver and it is presumed
he became confused when the
car commenced to gain speed on
the hill and was unable to oper
ate the appliances intented to
give complete control of the ma
chine at all times.
"Sister Mary Rose was about
38 years of age and before join
ing the Benedictine order was
Miss Bessie Hodges. A sister,
Mrs. Kelley, resides at St.
Maries.
"Sister Patricia is a sister of
Father John Condon, pastor of
the Catholic church at Newport,
Wash., and a sister of Dr. Ed
ward Condon, of Spokane. She
is seriously injured but the view
was expressed last evening that
she will recover.
"Sister Augustine is a daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. John Uhlen
kott of Cottonwood. She is
badly bruised but her injuries
are not regarded as serious.
"Mr. Herdiman is a pioneer of
the Genesee section. He is about
67 years of age and for many
years was engaged in farming.
He retired from the farm a few
years ago and has since main
tained his home in Genesee.
"It is evident that Sister Mary
Rose was killed instantly. Her
neck was broken and her body
was badly crushed. It is pre
sumed she was first thrown from
the car and the car rolled over
her and her body was caught in
such a manner as to be carried
down the embankment with the
car."
Sister Augustine received pain
ful injuries about the face and
head and was crushed about the
chest but is getting along nicely
and will soon be out of danger.
Sister Patricia was injured in
ternally and is still in a serious
condition, while Sister Anastasia
escaped unharmed.
Mr. Hordemann was taken to
Genesee Monday night and was
reported to have died the next
morning but this was an error
and he is now said to be doing
nicely and to stand a good chance
of recovering. «
The body of Sister Mary Rose
was brought to this place on
Tuesday evening's train and was
met at the station by a large
number of citizens and the re
mains were tenderly conveyed in
a beautifully decorated auto
hearse to the convent where they
rested in state until the funeral
Wednesday morning.
The funeral was held Wednes
day morning at 8:30 o'clock from
the convent chapel, Rev. Father
James reading a requiem high
mass in which he was assisted by
Rev. Fathers Philip, Boniface,
Willibrord and Jerome. A touch
ing tribute was paid the deceased
by Rt. Rev. Abbot Frowin Con
rad, who spoke at some length in
English, after which the funeral
cortege passed from the chapel
and proceeded to the little ceme
tery on the mount at the rear of
the convent where the remains
were laid lovingly to rest. A
large number of people, both
Catholic and Protestant, were
present to pay their respects to
the deceased, some of whom had
come many miles to be present
at the last rites.
Sister Rose, as she was fam
iliarly and lovingly known', was
a woman of beautiful character
and intellect and commanded the
deep esteem and respect of all
Thresher Lost By Smut
Explosion
The M. J. McMurray thresh
ing machine was destroyed by a
smut explosion and fire Monday
afternoon at the Anthony Wes
sels farm east of Greencreek,
the machine being practically re
duced to a scrap heap before the
•flames were subdued. The sep
arator was a new Minneapolis
and had been run only 33 days
last season. It started the sea
son's work this year on the Wes
sels farm and had only run three
hours until it was destroyed.
The explosion occurred just as the
clean-up was being made and in
an instant the machine was a
mass of flames. The crew made
a brave effort to put out the fire,
flooding the machine with water
and throwing dirt into it while
running the machine at füll
speed, but their efforts were in
vain and it was soon necessary to
pull the engine away from it,
after which the machine was
turned over on its side and the
flames finally extinguished. All
of the belts and other equipment
were saved and Mr. McMurray
came to town™ that same after
noon and placed an order for
another separator which will ar-w
rive here in a few days. His loss
is placed at about $1500.
No grain was destroyed by the
fire as it had been hauled to the
granary as fast as threshed.
This is the first smut explosion
in this vicinity this season but,
as the machines are just starting
up and there is said to be con
siderable smut in the fall wheat,
other accidents of the kind may
occur at any time.
$10,000 Wheat'Deal
The largest deal made thus far
this season in the grain business
at this point, was made the first
of the week when H?' M.
Williams bought forthe Vollmer
Clearwater company; 10,000
bushels of wheat from J. H."
("Montana") Mifethell and his
son-in-law, Will Huff. Tliis is
not all of thewheat that Messrs.
Mitchell And Huff will have to
sell as their crop will in all prob^_
bilif?T* aggregate around 13,00a
We understand that the amount
of the contract was well above
$10.000.—Stites Enterprise.
The Will Huflyibove mentioned
is a son of Mrs^Anthia Huff of
this place, and formerly resided
here for number of years.
Black-leg Appears on Prairie
Black-leg has made its appear
ance on the prairie and late last
week August VpnBargen lost six
h%d of calves and yearlings
from the dread disease. He im
mediately had the rest of his
young cattle, some 33 head in all,
vaccinated to prevent their takg
ing the disease and so. far has
not lost any more stock. . The
calves lost were all very fat,
which is generally the case
where disease appears. Dr.
Southworth, the local veterinari
an, diagnosed the disease and
vaccinated the rest of the herd.

whom she happened to meet
She taught the higher grades in
the local parochial school for sev
eral terms a few years ago and
endeared herself to both students
and parents, besides making
many friends in the community
at large. While her untimely
death came as a great shock, her
friends and associates are able to
console themselves in part with
the knowledge that she was
ready at all times to meet her
maker and has only been called
home by Him who doeth all
things well. May she rest in the
bosom of the Lord.
