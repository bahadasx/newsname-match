THE PROGRESS OP THE WAR.
Except (or the usual "assaults and
counter assaults" along the long lines of
eombat there is little on which to com
ment this week in actual lighting or pro
gress made by the opposing forces.
The news of the week however is sig
nificant Rou mania has at last entered
into the war on the side of the entente
allies.
Ever since the war began the attitude
of Roumania has been a question. Con
flicting statements placed her sometimes
*s favoring one side and the other. The
king of Roumania is a German and
would naturally favor tbe Teutons. His
.people were somewhat divided but the
majority favored the allies. Hatred of
the Bulgarians was also a factor, but
practically all critics agree that Rouma
nia has simply been waiting to see which
side would be successful before joining
in the strife, and that she now joins the
war simply to be able to add to her terri
torial possessions in the final settlement
when peace com/BS.
If Roumania has guessed right then
Bulgaria which went in some months
ago on the side of Germany, has guess
ed wrong and the results will be disas
trous to her.
In a military sense the action of Rou
mania at this time means considerable.
Up to this ttme Germany and Austria
have been receiving large amounts of
food stuffs from Roumania. Roumania
also has oil wells and has supplied Ger
many with large quantities of petrol.
Now Germany will have, only the oil
wells of Galicia to depend upon and tbe
Russians have already captured some of
these ancl are close to the others. The
fact that Roumania has practically .de
cided that the -allies will finally win
will have a large moral aspect that will
have considerable military influence.
As a military force Roumania will add
a half million of fresh troops to the
allies at a somewhat critical period and
will be a very welcome, addition to tbe
already long lines of offense.
Besides this, it opens up a large part
of the Auatrian boundary that hereto-jot these. These, however, form but
fore was seenre because of the neutrality eighteen per cent of the total of railway

1 that reach from Riga through Poland
and Galicia, The Russian and Rouma
nian armies are reported as having al
ready made junction.
Austria ia now defending her borders
from direct or threatened invasion from
the Italians on the-south, from the Rue
siana on tbe northwest, from Roumania
on the west, and incidentally from the
IPrench-Englisb45erbian armies who are
rallying out from Salonika.
It appears as if we shall look toward
Austria for the mere stirring events dur
,ing the next few tweaks, ihough possibly
this may be the -signal for a heavier
pressure on tbe other fronts to prevent
any large number of Teuton troops go*
dog to the rescue of Austria against the
Roumanians.
Wben Serbia declared war the kaiser
rushed his armies (there and crushed
that -small kingdom 'before the allies
had time to stop him. In the present
instanoe the question becomes'can he do
the«ame thing with Roumania?
THE STRIKE AND POLITICS
As we write this editorial the question
of the railway strike hangs in the bal
ance. .Next Monday morning may
see all the railways of the country stop
ped and with this thousands of other
industries which depend upon railroad
facilities.
Whether the railway difficulties are
settled or whether a calamitous strike
ensues is a question of hours, hut even
at this time the controversy has gone
far enough that its political effects will
certainly be far reaching in the two re
maining months of the campaign.
Whether Mr. Wilson has acted rightly
or wrongly in his attempt to settle the
difference whether he has acted ia good
faith without reference to his own politi
cal prospects need not be discussed here
the present point is that his acts will
have great political influence.
Whether the brotherhoods purposely
chose this time or whether the proposed
strike is merely coincident also cuts but
little figure in the actual result. The
railway strike will necessarily be a cam
paign issue.
At this time we are willing to go on
record as prophesying that if the strike
does occur that if will become the prin
cipal issue on election day in November,
and that even if it is settled or partially
settled that it will still be one of tbe
principal issues in determining the selec
tion of the next president.
As we write, it is proposed by the
president to bring the controversy be
fore congress. In brief the president
has told the employers that they must
give the employees an eight hour day.
The managers say thut it will coat the
roads 950,000,000 and that the roads will
go bankrupt. The president says raise
your freight rates. But the managers
say it will take congressional action to
do that and we want a guarantee from
congress that we bhall be allowed to
raise rates. Now the president is at
tempting to force the democratic major
ity to give such a guarantee.
That congress will not enjoy the medi
cine that Dr. Wilson has prepared for
them goes without saying. All the
representatives and half the senators
are up for re election this fall. That
they will have to declare themselves and
take sides does not appeal to them as a
pleasant prospect. If this question does
come into the congressional balls for
solution we prophesy about the hottest
debates that have been heard in those
halls for many a year. II may be that
the congressmen can fix up some tem
porary compromise that will let them
adjourn without putting each member
on record but it will be rather difficult.
As to the president himself we think
on the whole that he will lose votes
through the strike question. He will
undoubtedly gain some votes from tbe
brotherhoods. There are about 400,000
more lemployes, and but two per sent of the
to the already long lines I voting population of the United States.
VOLUME XXXVIII PEMBINA, PEMBINA COUNTY, NOBTJB DAKOTA, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 1st, 1916. NUMBER 11
The fact ia well known to the general
publio and oertainly to the employees
themselves, that while it may be a ques
tion whether the brotherhoods are well
paid, there ia no questioning the (act
that the'other eighty-two percent are
mostly paid amall wages. And theaa
low paid employes are today wondering
what show they will have to get an in
creaae in pay if the trainmen get so
large an increaae. The answer to a de
mand from these to the railway «nana
gets would be obviously "We pay the
trainmen so much that we cannot pay
ypu more." What proportion of theaa
railway laborers will vote for Mr. Wil
son?
The further ventilation of these mat*
ten will bring home to the general pub
lie the fact that President Wilson ha*
arbitrarily forced the managers to gtant'
ten houra wages in return tor eight
hours work and that he has, at least at
tempted, to force -congress aa the repre
sentatives of the people to say, take the
increased wages from the pockets of tfee
people—and this without asking the peo
ple, and without showing tbe people.'
Ttoe question at tbe polls in Novem
ber wilt not be, shall the trainmen re
ceive 950,000,000 increase in wages, but
rather shall any man have the power,
to order tbe people to pay such a sum
or any other amount without their know
ledge and consent?
It is tbe old question of the American
revolution. With arbitration the peo
ple .would have representation. Now it
is taxation without representation. So
far the people have had no representa
tion in this railway controversy. All,
they know is that President Wilson sayaj
they must pay over the 950,000,000.
At tbe November election the people!
will then have something to say in this
matter It will be a political question
then, whether the brotherhoods or the
president intend it or desire it.
CANADIAN STOCK SHIPMENT*
In sauntering around the station at
Noyes the other day, a train of cattle,
consisting of fifty three cars, in number
over twenty-five hundred head, came in.
Some were ready for the butcher whito
others would have to be fed before they'
would be fit for tbe block. On enquir
mg we learned that there are also from
two to three special trains a week carry*
ing fish from Prince Rupert and other
points for the American markets, over
the same road,
These shipments are regular occur-1
ances. It struck us forcibly, for w'e/
knew tbe government don't get a cent
in revenue from this kind of traffic.
Here was at least 9150,000 worth of Can
adian cattle coming in free which under
the Republican tariff would have netted
the government 925,000 to 930^000 in
duty. The duty on fish used to be a
half cent a pound, which amounted to
several hundred dollars per car. These
are also free under the present Demo
cratic regulations. Is it any wonder
that you have to lick a revenue stamp
every time you send a phone messagfe,
or a twenty-five cent parcel by express.
W« .would not say anything about it
if we were allowed the same privilege in
shipping into Canada". But the Canadi
ans believe in Republican doctrine, and
having the Canadian markets for Can
adians. It is a rule that has built up
United States industries and it will
build up tbe Canadian industries the
same. y-
These local ports that used to turn -in
over 930,000 monthly, into the govern
ment treasury under Republican ruling
are not taking in enough cash now to'
pay the expenses of the office,
We imagine that after the 4tb of
March next you will quit licking ^reve
nue stamps, and our neighbors to the
north will have to pay the same amount
of duty on exports that we-have to ply
to ship stuff into Canada.
FEDERAL GOVERN
MENT INVESTIGATING.
We received a visit from Mr. fienij' R.
Cgtes of the United States Department
of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. Fri
day. Mr. Cates was sent out 'by .the
federal government to look into -the
weed situation in tbis state and tolas'
certain the actual condition in diffeirent
localities and what weed were the diost
destructive t6 crops, and also 4hat
remedies were applied to eradicate tlfom.
The Pioneer Express learned the follow*
ing. ¥.
He has travelled over every section of
the state, and haa drawn a map showing
where tbe different noxious weeds thrive
themoBt. This map is interesting: It
shpwi this northeast corner of the^ftate
to be infested with the sow thistle jhore
than any other past. But it is exlaiid
ing to other localities fsst. His jnqip
showed that the French weed that' was

here twenty years ago
is#m
moetobnox-
KHM weed in the Motrte River country
MT.
This weed is diminished here and
is given Luf little attention*.
Around Mark* and LA teh ville, south
west of Fafgo, they have what is called
"Toad Flax" that is giviag the termers
lets of trouble and proaaises to eqnsl the
aow thistle in dsftMMtivensss to small
grain. It derives its name from its
aimilarity to flax.
His map showed that in the western
part of tbe state the "TumblingM—
tard" ia spreading over tbe country at a
rapid rate. This plaat is confined to
the dryer arena of the atate and when
the season is wet it does not do well.
It is through tbe appeal of Senator
McCumber snd other members from
North Dakota that the government is
taking this step.
On being asked what he would recom
mend to the department Mr. Cates said
bis report would only show conditions
out here, but one thing he thought es
cential would be to recommend that the
federal government take supervision of
publichigb ways to see that ail kinds of
weeds be destroyed at the proper time,
LOOKING BACKWARD.
The Democrata promised in their 1912
campaign to reduce the coat of living by
reducing tariff. Today, notwithstand
ing the fact that imports are the great*
ast in our history, the cost of living is
soaring.
They steer clear of that subject in the
platform of 1916. They promised eeon
omy, and their appropriations, even in
times of peace, exceeded all records in
our history by millions upon milions of
dollars. This is a matter of record.
In the early part of 1915, with the Eur
opean war raging and Mexico on the
rampage, they were against prepared
ness. They have changed their minds
on the degree of preparedness which
should be provided, They are now
making appropriations for ^pit-pareduL-ss
with a reckless and criminal disregard
of the wherewithal to foot the bills.
With the price of eveaything going up
ithiy have evidently decided that the
Jf^of taxation, the more they can buy
with the money, and these appropria
tions will provide contract for liberal
subscribers to the Democratic camp
aign fund. Isn't it about time to stop
this sort of thing and get on a sane busi'
ness basis? The Republican party can
put us there.
ROUMANIA.
Roumania has an area about as large
as the British Isles. It has about two
and a half millions of people. Scattered
about that country in adjoining locali
ties belonging to Russia and Austria are
about as many more Roumanians. It is
to join these outside Roumanians with
the kingdom that such adjoining terri
tory is so greatly desired by Roumania
and is probably the leading motive in
joining the war at this time.
The Roumanians are not Slavs though
there is a mixture of Slav blood. They
claim to be descendants of the ancient
Romans and by blood and language re
lated to the Italians. They are follow
ers of the Greek church and acknow
ledge the patriarach at Athens as their
spiritual head.
If the allies are successful, Roumania
will doubtless become the most power
ful of the Balkan states and allied with
Greeee, Serbia and Montenegro, leaving
Bulgaria as the odd and weakest one.
The President is 6till shouting for
''forward looking men" to stand by his
side. Men who look backward, espec
ially those who look backward over the
administration's record, are moet dis
tastful to him.
We understand that Wilson's latest
'great diplomatic victory", which is
over Carrauza, is just like all that have
preceded it the other follow is left per
fectly satsfied.
I have a call for a second-hand, twin
cylinder motorcycle. Indian or Harley
Davidson preferred. If you have one
let me know condition of machine and
price asked. G. G. THOMPSON
