ed by tonight.

The house adopted by a special rule
today permitting the passage of the
Adamson eight-hour bill at 4:30
o'clock this afternoon.
It was conceded today by Demo
cratic leaders that the bill finally
passed would provide only for an

ber 1 or January 1, with the present
10-hour rate of pay and pro rata

The Adamson BilL
This, with the date December 1, is
in substance the Adamson bill, revised
by Representative Adamson and
Democratic Leader Kitchin, after
conferring with President Wilson
and which A. B. Garretson, spokes
man for the brotherhoods, stated for
mally, would be considered a "satis
factory settlement" and would pre
vent the walkout. The interstate
commerce commission has agreed to
report out a similar, bill with the date
January l, and roads under 200 miles
in lengthe exempted.
Speaker Clark has remarked that
enactment of the strike legislation by
Saturday night would mean final ad
journment of congress next Wednes
day.
To Supreme Court.
Chicago, Sept. 1.Western rail
way executives state that they will
carry the congressional railway legis
lation pending to the supreme court.
They stated that such a bill might
postpone the strike but it would not
settle the trouble.
Hale Holden of the Burlington,
spokesman for the railway execu
tives, stated today that the supreme
court had recently ruled twice that
congress has absolutely no power to
fix wages.
"The railways won't agree to the
Adamson bill," he said. "The unions
might accept and continue their work
but we will continue to pay the same
wages. Then the government will
sue to compel increased wage pay
ments and then will come the court
action.
