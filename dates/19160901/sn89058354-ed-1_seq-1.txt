POLITICAL POT BOILS
Real Battle To Be Staged In
November Between Weldon
and Convention Choice
LITTLE INTEREST IS SHOWN
IN APPROACHING CONVENTION
McCall Announces and Will
Make Fight Before Gather
ing At McKenzie Soon
Interest in the approaching
political battle between William
E, Weldon and the nominee of
the McKenzie convention, who
is yet to be chosen, for the State
Senate continues to increase
daily, and by the time the Nov
ember polls have opened the
fight will i have developed into
one of the warmest contests ever
pulled off in Henry and Carroll
counties.
The first act was staged at
McKenzie some weeks ago when
the senatorial committee ordered
s delegated convention to be
held at that place on Saturday,
September 9, following mass
conventions at Paris and Hunt
ingdon on September 4. Mr.
Weldon, who has been an an
nounced candidate for several
months and who had contended
for a primary to select the nomi
nee, at once issued a statement,
backing up a former card to the
same effect, saying that) he
would not submit his claims to a
convention but would appeal to
the voters in the November
election. He also announced
that should he . be elected he
would repeal the present Henry
county road law. ,
Just previous to the committee
meeting. T. V. Burton, popular
Elkhorn business man, announced
his candidacy for the nomination.
Since that time Mr. Burton has
been seeing a good many of the
voters in both counties and has
met with much encouragement,
it is said. He will go into the
convention at McKenzie and his
friends are confident that he will
be nominated.
A few days ago Jo H. McCa'll,
present Senator, announced his
candidacy, subject to the con
vention, and it seems that the
fight between him and Mr. Bur
ton will be warm, although not
very much interest is being
hown in the convention. . Both
have many strong supporters in
the two counties, however, and
it seems that when the second
act Of the senatorial drama is
staged at McKenzie one week
from tomorrow that there may
be some interesting times.
There seems little doubt, how
ever, but that the Big Show,
which will be pulled off at the
polls in November, will draw
the most interest

REALTY MARKET GROWS
ACTIVE EARLY; SIGNS
TO
Local Real Estate Men Receive
tetters From Many Buyers
In Northern States
DEALS RECORDED HERESH0W
$6,000 WORTH PROPERTY SOLD
Early Opening Of Market Is
Indication Of Loosening
Money Matters
According to the local real es
tate agents and the records in
the office of County Register W.
L. Manning, the Henry county
real estate market is becoming
active this year earlier than be
fore in many years.
The local real estate firms,
Adams & Currier, H. L. Smith,
and Douthit & Currier, report
much Henry county property list
ed for sale and many letters re
ceived from prospective northern
buyers. Some large deals are
now on foot and it seems proba
ble that quite a number of others
will be negotiated within the
near future.
The opening up of the real
estate market in August is some
thing new for Henry county, and
points to general prosperity and
the loosening of the money mar
ket, it is believed.
Records in the office of Regis
ter Manning show that deals to
the total amount of more than
$6,000 have been made within
the past ten or twelve days.
Following are the transfers that
have been recorded:
H. C. Paschall and wife to N.
E. Paschall, 100 acres, $1,000.
J. F. Upchurch to T. L. Blake-
more, 6 1-2 acres, $175.
J P. Stubblefieldto W. H.
Hays, 55 acres. $110.
C. Court to J. W. Rogers, 70
acres, $176.
W. C. Johnson to E. H. Minor,
lot, $500.
R. L. Rickman, et al., to J no.
R. Diggs. lots, $300.

the closing of the canning club
girls' encampment at the fair
grounds with a rally, to which
all Henry countians are invited.
The girls went into camp at the
fair grounds Tuesday , with a
large number participating. The
encampment has been a success
in every way. The girls are
having a fine time and the ex
perimental and demonstration
work in the art of canning vege
tables and fruits has been inter
esting and instructive to them.
Miss Mabel Wheatley, Miss
Myrtle Harding and Mis3 Mar
tha Thomas, teachers in the dem
onstration work, have been on
the grounds since the beginning
of the encampment, giving the
girls the benefit of their exper
ience and training in this svork.

will be on display and a large
number of people throughout the
county are expected to be in at
tendance. Many prominent

de vision of extension, University
of Tennessee; H. S. Nichols, of
the West Tennessee demonstra
tion farm; Mr. Schoenfield, mar
ket specialist and Mrs. Warner,
health specialist, of the Univer
sity of Tennessee.
Local merchants and business
men contributed to the success
of the encampment by giving
money and many articles need
ed by the girls. The encamp
ment has been under the direc
tion of Miss Hessie Smith, coun
ty demonstration agent, and to
her should go much of the credit
for the success of the undertak
ing.

Officials Go In
On Monday the recently elect
ed county officials will appear
before County Court Clerk W. I.
Dale, make their bonds, prescribe
to the oath and take their
respective offices. It has long
been the custom in Henry caunty
to induct the new officials into
office on the first Monday in
September, rather than on the
first day of the month, and the
custom will be followed this
year
In the August election Sheriff
T. M. Hagler and Tax Assessor
J. Sam Culpepper were reelected
to their respective offices, and D.
T. Spaulding was chosen county
judge with D. L. Jackson as
county trustee.
Rev. Spaulding was formerly
county register for two terms,
but Mr. Jackson never held a
county office. Both are well
known throughout the county
and were nominated , in the
county Democratic primary last
fall.
Wallace Oliver, a well known
young man of the Buchanan
section, will be Mr. . Jackson's
assistant in the trustee's office,
it is understood, succeeding
Wade H. Whitlock, who has
served under the present trustee,
W. T. Young. '
For several days Mr. Oliver
has been in the office, getting in
touch with the duties of the posi
tion. Mr. Young and Mr Whitlock
have taken much pleasure in ex
plaining and assisting him in
every way possible. Mr. Oliver has
made many friends here and
there is no doubt but that he
will make an efficient assistant
to Mr. Jackson.
Sheriff Hagler will probably
retain all of his former deputies
through his new term of office,
which he enters Monday.
