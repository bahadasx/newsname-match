Practically every one in Charlevoix
County has an article which could be
entered in one of these, departments
and which would have a good chance
of being awarded a premium. If all
Departments are not flooded with en
tries it will be your fault and not that
of the Management. See to it that you
are one of those who helps out the
Fair by entering articles for Premiums
and thus making the competition keen.
The Fair is held early this year and
that means that many visitors from
other parts of the State and other
States will be in attendance. Enter
your articles and advertise the pro
ductiveness of this County to these
visitors.
All residents of the County know
what it can produce and each of you
who have articles of quality know that
they are good. Be Loyal. Enter these
for premiums. Demonstrate to each
outsider that this County is a very pro
ductive one. Do this and increase the
value of your farm.
The Free Attractions of this Fair

of admission.

$1.00 each. These make you a mem
ber of the Society for one year, give
you the right to vote for Directors of
the Society and admit you to the
grounds for three days of the Fair.

Who had so many children she didn't

Close Contests
In Primaries
Results Still Doubtful In Many
Offices.
Election returns, as a rule, are rather
slow and the returns for the August
Primaries this year seem exceptionally
so.
At " the present writing Albert E.
Sleeper is the choice of Michigan for
Governor, with ninety per cent of the
vote in. These latest figures give
Sleeper 52800; Leland 45,370; with
Diekema's vote being less than 25,000
and Gardner's less than 20,000.
In the senatorial contest the re-
nomination of Townsend is assured the
latest reports giving Townsend a lead
over Hill of approximately 20,000.
For Lieutenant Governor Dickinson
is nominated by a safe majority over
Hemenan.
In the State Senatorial fight, the
contest is rather close but the indica
tions are that Morford has been safely
renominated over Hinkley.
In the County, J. E. Chew will be the
Republican Candidate for Representa
tive, having won a decisive victory
over the four other candidates.
For Register of Deeds McDonald is
leading Emery by approximately one
hundred votes.
For Road Commissioner House won
the nomination over Lorch and E. C.
Chew.
The balance of the ticket will remain
the same as heretofore, Judge Correll
and Sheriff Novak having no opposi
tion. Clerk Richard Lewis and Pros.
Att'y Rollie L. Lewis both won out
over their contestants. Treasurer
Weaver had no opposition. For
Coroners, Drs. Wilkinson of Charle
voix and Dicken of East Jordan will be
the candidates. Surveyor Robinson
and Drain Com'r Smith had no opposi
tion. Learn a Little Every Day

STANDARDIZING
MICHIGAN
FARM MARKETING
East Lansing, Mich., Aug. 28. The
Michigan Standard Co-operative Ass'n,
as outlined by the Markets Department
of the Michigan Agricultural College,
has several distinctive features. First,
it has no capital stock; second, it is
composed only of those who make
their living by growing farm or horti
cultural products; third, there are no
profits, the savings obtained because
of the economies of collective activity
are distributed among the members in
accordance with the amount of busi
ness done by each member with the as
sociation; fourth, there is no proxy vot
ing. It is an association of men and
not a combination of capital. The as
sociation has capital, but there are no
shares, and the capital is only a means
to an end. This capital comes from
membership fees and loans made by
the members to the organization. The
operation of the Ass'n does not result
in profits but in savings to the mem
bers because of the economies of large-
scale transactions. Any surplus that
may accumulate because of exceptional
savings is distributed at the close of
the year among the members in accord
ance with the amount of business they
have done with the organization.
The standard association enjoys the
protection of the Clayton amendment
to the Sherman Anti-Trust law, because
it is constructed according to the sug-
gestionsontained in the amendment.
The standard. association is the first
step in Michigan toward a general pro
motion of efficiency in the distribution
of farm products. The second step
will be the establishment of uniform
grades for quality, and the third step
will be the classifying and harmonizing
of the accounting systems, so that the
operations of the different associations
will be comparable one with another.
The federal and state governments
have already done much toward stand
ardizing and accounting systems used
by the railroads, the banks and the in
surance companies and it is only rea
sonable that it extend a similar service
to the organizations marketing the
great food crops of the country.

Michigan Director of Markets.
When a mother tells a bachelor about
the cute thing her baby did, he never

Sometimes it is so hard for a father
to give his daughter in marriage that
he gets discouraged in trying.

WISE AND OTHERWISE
He (or she) is a queer voter who
cannot find a candidate to his (or her)
liking this year. '
Happiness is a perfume you cannot
pour on others without getting a few
drops on yourself.
Where are the weather prophets who
along in May, staked their reputation
that this would be a cool summer?
It is said the United States has
enough salt to supply the world, and
yet the United States is not so fresh as
it used to be.
Our idea of a true disciple of pre
paredness is the man who spends his
summer vacation in cleaning out the
furnace and splitting up kindlingwood.
When you see two white shoes dry
ing on a window-sill and a girl hanging
out of the window to dry her hair, you
can bet she is not going to eat onions
for supper.
Next to a bow-legged girl in a short
skirt, our idea of the funniest thing in
sartorial eccentricity is a man with the
pyramidal Adam's apple and a sport
shirt.
Things are getting serious for the
wets in Chicago. Since the mayor has
revoked 200 licenses there are only 5000
saloons left in the city, and it is said
there are districts where people must
walk two whole blocks to get a drink.
Hints for Housewives
If silver is to be stored away for some
time, pack it in dry flour, it will not be
tarnished.
If fruits are canned as soon as they
are picked, there will be less loss by
fermentation.
Under arm perspiration may be re
moved by muriatic acid. Other pers
piration by a strong soap solution and
hot sun.
To save both time and the cream in
whipping it, whip it in a pitcher instead
of a bowl. There is no chance of splat
tering. A common brass cup hook, such as is
used in China closets, can easily be
screwed into the end of the broom
handle, to hang it by.
If a tablespoonful of cold water is
added to the beaten white of an egg,
and then sufficient confectioners sugar
to thicken is put in. You will have a
frosting that will cut without breaking.
. It should be a matter of common
knowledge, since flour i3 always with
in convenient reach, that wheaten
flour is the best extinguisher to throw
over a fire caused by the spiling and
igniting of kerosene.

Many Free Attractions To Be

WHAT IS GOOD
FOR ONE SHOULD
x BE GOOD FOR ALL
Anybody can work for himself, be
selfish, friendless, accumulate money
and property, die, be buried and not
be missed. Not the selfish interests of
one or a few, but the welfare of all
must be the standard rule for every
transaction. In the building of roads,
all must work together for the common
good. If a man cannot have a good
road come to his farm, but can get it a
short distance away, is it not his duty
and to his advantage to have it come to
as near his own farm as is possible? It
would be better for him to either haul
a load over his poor road to the good
road, there unload it and go back and
get another load and when he reaches
the good road, reload the one he had
hauled there and so go on to town.
This, of itself, is proof that good roads
are profitable and a great economizer
of both time and wear and tear. There
are lots of ways to make money, but
none easier nor more positive than
this way. Concrete roads can now be
built nine feet wide, with shoulders on
either side of crushed hard heads, mak
ing a seventeen foot road, for approxi
mately two thousand dollars a mile
more than the nine foot gravel
road that we are now building.
Have you any idea what it would
mean if we had such a road on the
entire west end of our county to ac
commodate the tourists who come up
over the Dixie Highway and West
Michigan Pike and then tohave a con
crete road that would run from Charle
voix to Boyne City, from Boyne City to
Boyne Falls, from Boyne City to East
Jordan and from East Jordan to the
West end of the county to accommodate
that business, and then from East Jor
dan into Charlevoix. Well, I can tell
you something about it. Clubs and
associations would be formed, new golf
links laid out and just think for a
moment that the caddie boys in this
town received last year more than five
thousand dollars for their work and
this year will receive even more. In a
few years, there wouldn't be a fine
prominent building spot that would not
be occupied by a summer cottage and
prices for land throughout the whole
county and in fact, some of the adjoin
ing counties, also, would soar aloft just
as the resort property has in the city of
Charlevoix. It is estimated by those
who ought to know that more than half
a million dollars will be paid out in
Charlevoix by the tourists alone this
year and we would think we were a
wonderful city if we had manufactur
ing interests here th'at would pay out
the same amount. We would have
motor boats not by the dozen but by
the hundred on Pine Lake and Charle
voix County (I want the young people
to take particular pains to remember
what I am saying) would be the mecca
and would be known virtually the world
over as the greatest resort county in
the United States.
We now have the opportunity, if we
will embrace it, to use the State money
and get a double free reward for it on
the West Michigan Pike and Dixie
Highway and tome day the State may
conclude that they cannot continue to
keep this up and withdraw their offer.
So it seems to me that' it would be a
good business droposition to go to work
and build these roads right away, par
ticularly, the one just mentioned, and
so get our double reward.
Get together, friends, think it over
and talk it over, .because what is good
for you is good for me and what is cood
for me is also good for you.
