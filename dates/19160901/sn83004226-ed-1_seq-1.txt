over the door of the defendant's home.
A short time after the notice was post

olllcer and had the notice posted, and
livirned from this otllcer that Judge
Snmpnn was holding court In 'Whit

Not wanting tn take any chances,
Judge Kirk dclclrd the best thing to
do was to go to lA'hltley City and get

much surprised, according to Judge
Kirk, that he was on the train. Judge
Kirk gave his opponent potice, but the
liarbourville Judge refused to accept
sorvlfe, whereupon Judge Kirk decid
ed h would remain with him until he
left the train and an officer eohld be
seoujnd. At Somerset Judge Sampson
got Iff, followed by Kirk, the two reg

8HIPMENT8 OF LIVE
.""-.-' - : . ' 8TOCK. -
The railway strike ordered for next
Monday Is already seriously felt here.
An embargo was placed on cattle and
all perishable freight shipments on
Thursday of this week. Both the N. 4
W. and C. & O. railways are refusing
to handle cattle and our farmers and
dealers will be forced to carry their
stock. Several shipments were ready
to go out from here this week, but it is
all off. Thus are we brought face to
face with the seriousness of a, strike
even before it actually goes Into effect.
If the strike should continue for any
considerable time it will be worse for
the farmers than whan the foot and
mouth disease stopped the movement of
cattle two years ago. One fact that Is
favorable to the farmer of ..this., sec.
Uon la that grass is plentiful Just now.
and the crops of feed stuff are good.
Seven car loads of cattle were ship
ped from Fort Gay Thursday of this
week, the embargo on llvo stock going !
into effect at midnight of that duy.

He will leave on Monday for Charles
ton, W. Va, to attend the annual Con
ference. At the lust meeting of the quarterly
conference a resolution was unanimous
ly adopted asking fur the return of
Rev. McKldowney to this work. This
wlltrmfotiiwwtby or BXTOirgpetltlon;
We have not seen a more unanimous
demand for the return of pastor to
Louisa than exists in this Instance. He
Is an exceptionally strong preacher,
earnest, eloquent and forceful. He has
done an unusual amount of preaching
in both the town and the country and
has shown himself always' ready to
answer every call where there Booms
to be a chance to do good: He Is a man
of tremendous ehef-gy. The call for his
return to Louisa is not confined to the
membership of his' own church, but
comes from a considerable number of
outside persons who have been helped
by hla preaching.
Mr. McEldowney ' will preach next
Sunday at the court house, morning
and evening. We are requested by the
officials to say that everyBody Is in
vited to be present at those last ser
vices. There is never any certainty
about what an annual MethodlHt Con
ference will do, so thlinmay be the last
t'm .y." ,?iU haVO-(a.?rher-evening
Rev. McEldowney. He-would no doubt
appreciate having large congregations,

self to the people of Louisa. Sho is a
fine christian character and has ren

the children of the Junior League.
