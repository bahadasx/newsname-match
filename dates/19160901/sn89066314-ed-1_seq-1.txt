Ily United Press.
LONDON", Sept. 1. A revolution
which may signalize the entrance of
Greece into the European war has
broken out in Northern Greece and,
according to Saloniki reports, King
Constantinc has abdicated the throne.
Official dispatches from Saloniki
this afternoon announced that the
revolutionists arc in control of one
district in Macedonia and the gov
ernment force in the Macedonian
town of Vodena have joined the revo
lutionists. The Greek troops in Sa
loniki were disarmed and interned by
the Anglo-French forces after a com
pany of revolutionists had laid: siege
to the garrison and fighting had re
sulted. Athens apparently is cut off from
communication with the outside world.
No confirmation of the Saloniki re
port of King Constantino's abdication
has come from the Greek capital, but
it Is known that a revolutionary party
faoring the Allies was secretly ac
tive. The twenty-six year old Crown
Prince, George, according to Saloniki
dispatches, assumed the regency fol
lowing his father's abdication. An
idol of the Greek people and Pro-Ally
in sympathy, he is understood to have
had the backing of former premier
Vcnizelos, leader of the pro-war
party.
The Greek Crown Prince i3 very
popular and understood to be Pro-Ally,
despite the fact he received his
military education at a German acad
emy and holds a honorary commission
in the Prussian guard. He partici
pated in the last two Balkan wars as
an officer in the Greek army.
The general mobilization of the
Greek army has been ordered. It is
believed here that Greece, influenced
by the Bulgarian declaration of war
on Rumania today, will immediately
range her armies alongside those of
the Allic3 in an effort to crush the
Bulgars.

SAVE PM A YEAR
So Says McPherson at Con
vention of County Teach

BUDGET SYSTEM AIDS
R. H. Emberson and Dr.
Abner Jones Also Includ
ed in the Program.
The second day of the Boone Coun
ty Teachers' Association opened in the
High School Auditorium this morning
with an address by Elmer Mace of
Rocheport upon "Conditions and
Needs of Country Life." He declared
that the social life of the rural com
munities would have to be raised, if it
were to be expected that the farmers'
children arc to remain in the coun
try. J. E. McPherson, superintendent of
the Columbia schools, made an extra
talk upon the general subjects of the
relation between school boards and
teachers. He quoted instances where
schools are mismanaged and showed
how they could be put upon a business
basis.
Mr. McPherson declared that the
Columbia schools were saving $4,000
a year by buying supplies in a business-like
manner. He Showed how the
budget system was helping to put the
Columbia schools N upon a scientific
basis. If school boards will not take
the time to run the schools properly,
the boards should pay the teachers
enough salary for them to attend to
these matters.
"The trouble with the rural school
Is that it does not pay but 30 and 40
cents p. hundred assessed aluation,
while the Columbia school district
pays $1.30. I am safe in saying that
I could buy the school supplies for
Boone County, and sae one-third of
the present cost."
When Abner Jones asked Mr. Mc
Pherson if it would be advisable to
have a county supplies purchaser, Mr.
McPherson replied that his salary
could he more than saed, if there
were to be no politics.
R. II. Emberson, a state organizer
for the bojs' and girls' clubs, made
a talk urging the teachers to co-op-crate
with these clubs. About 80 per
sons agreed to organize the clubs in
their districts.
,Dr. Abner Jones outlined the plan
of the proposed rural school survey
for Boone County. This survey will
not be made until the school year is
nearly finished, in order that the
maximum results may be obtained.

T HERE
Lieutenant J. C. King Here
for a Few Days to Look
Over the University.
The new commandant of the Uni
versity Cadet Corps, Lieutenant Jo
seph C. King, reported for duty this
morning in Columbia, looked over the
ground, was favorably impressed and
left for St. Louis this afternoon to
bring Mrs. King back with him in a
few days if the strike doesn t take
place.
Lieutenant King has just returned
from Mexico where for the last five
months he was First Lieutenant of
the Seventh Cavalry in General Per
shing's Division. While her husband
was in Mexico, Mrs. King stayed with
her parents at Fort Mcintosh, La
redo, Tex.
Lieutenant Kings' home is at Mus
catine, la. He was a student in Ames
University in 1901. During the Spanish-American
War, he served as mu
sician in Company C of the 50th Iowa
Volunteer Infantry. He was graduat
ed from West Point in 1906. He has
since seen very little service in the
United States. From 1907 to 1909
and from 1913 to -1915 he was in serv
ice in the Philippines. He remained
in Mexico from March 16 to August
16.
The reason why the University of
Missouri was without a commandant
for a few months last year was ex
plained by Lieutenant King. He re
ceived an order March 7 at Hachita,
Mexico, to come to the University.
Just as he was about to get on the
train, he received word of the Co
lumbus raid and was recalled to duty.
He was then but twenty miles away
from Columbus. If the Columbus raid
had occurred one day later, the Mis
souri Military School would have had
a commandant.
This is Lieutenant King's first visit
to Columbia.
Lieutenant King would not discuss
the situation In Mexico and Philip
pines, saying only that the Philip
pines arc now very peaceful except
for a few raids which the natives are
taking care of. The soldiers from
the United States have no trouble at
all.
iE. II. Hughes Retain.
E. H. Hughes, assistant professor
of animal husbandry at the College of
Agriculture returned today from his

SENATE TO HOLD
A NIGHT SESSION
Adamson Eight-Hour Bill
Will Be Rushed Through
Tonight, Thus Averting
Immediate R. R. Trouble.
Ily United Tress.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 1-President
Wilson will receive notification that
Monday's threatened railway strike
has been called off siniullaneously
with the formal notification tomorrow
of his renomination for flic presi
dency. The Senate plans to rush the 8-hour
hill through before it adjourns to
night. All arrangements for a night session
were completed late this afternoon.
Senate leaders said they would re
main in session even after midnight
to get a vote. They said the bill which
the Senate will put through will be
about the same as the Adamson bill
in the House. When the latter meas
ure comes np in the Senate late to
day It may be substituted for the Sen
ate bill. In any event, leaders said
the completed bill should reach the
President before tomorrow afternoon.
The Senate bill, like that of the
House, sets January 1 for the pro
posed law to go into effect.
It sets the period of investigation
from six to eight months, instead of
six to nine months, and provides a
per diem compensation of $25 for
commission members.
The Senate bill also provides that
the Interstate Commerce Commission
shall have power to fix hours of la
bor and prescribe just and reasonable
wages for all railroad employes en
gaged in operation of trains in inter
state.
Decision as to wages by the com
mission shall be made within six to
twelve months, the commission under
the bill having the power from time
to time to change the hours and
wages.
General debate on the House bill
ended at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon.
In the Senate the interstate com
merce committee reported the Senate
bill favorably at 2:30 o'clock and un
animous consent to proceed was
given.
As soon as Senator Newlands com
pleted his explanation of the bill.
Senator Cummins asked:
"Does the section which imposes a
penalty on all who delay or obstruct
operation of trains apply to an em
ploye who refuses to moxe a train?"
"It is meant merely to keep the ar
teries of trade open and to prevent
anyone wilfully closing them," re
plied Newlands.
Reed of Missouri joined Cummings
in the attack on the penalty section.
He got Newlands to admit that that
section and the one which gives
the Interstate Commerce Commission
power to fix wage rates and hours
of labor were put in the bill by the
committee and not in any way sug
gested by the President.
The Missourian declared the pen
alty section virtually mcan3 abroga
tion of right to strike and Intolun
tary servitude for the employe, al
though Newlands insisted it was not
so meant.
Following adjournment of the Re
publican Senate conference, it was
announced Senator Smoot would in
troduce a substitute resolution to in
clude provision for compulsary atbl
tration. Some of the members who attended
said there would be no attempt to
filibuster against the committee bill,
but that strong effort would be made
to get the arbitration provision.
