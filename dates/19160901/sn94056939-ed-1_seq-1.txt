BURSUM'S SPEECH
I OF ACCEPTANCE
Saya Governor McDonald is a
Friend of Mr. McDonald
and Always Demanda Quick
Action in Land Matters
FORGOT HIS OLD SLOGAN OF
"LET THE PEOPLE BULE'
I am not unmindful of the high
compliment you have paid mo
and the expression of confidence
yhich you repose by selecting me
as your candidate lor governor,
I accent this trust, and shall cx
pond every energy to the utmost
of my ability toward assisting in
carrying the Republican banner
to victory. With a united warty.
ufrrcssivc and constant devotion
in behalf of our cause, we have
every reason to feel confident
that on the 7th day of November
next, at the close of the polls the
th Republican ticket from top
to bottom, as nominated in this
convention, will bo triumnhant
This is a Republican year. The
voters of the United States look
to the Republican party for
constructive policy, for sucti nc
tion as will promote the progress
and prosperity oc tne whole
people. This is but natural
After nearly four years of Demo
crutic administration the Demo
crats have been found wanting ,
in statesmanship, in stability and
in vision and American citizens
throughout this land feel humili
ated at the results caused by the
vascillating, unstable, changeable
peacc-at-r - price policy of
Woodrow vVilson. Never in the
history of the world has there
been so little respect in foreign
lands for the rights of American
citizens. The present chief ex
ecutive of the nation has been on
all sides of all questions, and
while the people might be in
formed as to his policy of today,
they would be perfectly safe to
assume that his lwlicy of to
morrow would bo the reverse.
Vacillation and uncertainty in the
puliclcs of government nre cal
culated to create distrust, and
distrust means industrial depres
sion. No Nation can prosper
without absolute confidence in
the stability of the administration
of the government. Here in this
state we have hud nearly five
years of Democratic rule. The
people arc tired and restless
of the do-nothing policy of Gover
nor McDonald. During these
five years not one sentence of
constructive legislation has been
proposed by your chief executive.
Under the constitution of this
state the legislature and the ex
ecutive are constituted as the
law making body of the state,
the accepted theory being that
there should be co-operation and
consultation between the execu
tive and the legislature. Yet
during these five years not one
ounce of the spirit of co-operation
has been exhibited by the chief
executive of this state. The
ixilicy of Governor McDonald has
been to shirk and shrink every
responsibility. He has been con
tent to draw his salary and sit
back on his dignity, finding
Éfiultfwith that which others have
done and to exercise his preroga
tive of the veto.
My friends, no progress can bo
made, no new development can
be expected, either in" govcrnv
mcnt or industry, except by and
thmuorh n constructive nolicv. It
is only through a constructive
policy, It is only through this
sort of a nolicv that mistakes are
ascertained. Mistakes we have
mode in the post and mistakes
can only be rectified through
experience.
The democratic administration
ios been scandalously negligent
in the supervision of our state
banking institutions and in some
cases thev have not failed to sec
tliat the law was observed but
have actually aided in an attempt
to bolster up unworthy institu
tions at the expense of the dc
positors. In Las Cruces the
citizens of Dona Ana county were
told by Democratic olhcials that
the First State bank was solvent
They were told this in the face of
the fact that the governor's
traveling auditor's force well
knew that the bank was hopeless
ly insolvent and the treasurer of
the Agricultural collego was
ounng in state money with one
and and drawing overdrafts
with the other. Up to the pros
cnt time there is still $78,000
firopcrtv of the Agricultural col
eare, which as yet has not been
recovered and wo await with
patience, and I hope, a pardon
able desrrcc of interest for some
defense of these methods pcrsued
by the Democratic administration
of this state.
The time for political banks
has long passed and even though
such banks may be substantial
contributors to the campaign
funds of a political imrtv no party
can continue to command the
confidence of its people who
will pay political debts with the
people's money.
CATTLE AND SHEEP
Under the Republican ndmlnls
.ration for the past 20 years the
administration of tho cattle and
sheep sanitary boards were ab
solutely non-partisan. They were
regarded as dealing with indust
ries vital to the prosperity of the
state, and offic'alson these boards ,
were selected only with reference
to their fitness, capacity and
knowdledgo of the industries af
fected. For years, under Repub
lican administration William C.
McDonald was at the hood of
the cattle sanitary board of this
state. He was placed there bo
cause he was considered to be a
practical man, well versed in tho
business of cattle raising. The
leading sheep raisers of the state
wore selected as members of the
sheen sanitary beard, to adminis
ter the affairs relating to the
sheep industry and the Hon.
Solomon Luna, who was the
leading sheep raiser of New
Mexico on account of his iect(liar
fitness and knowledge of that
industry was the chairman of the
sheep sanitary board. Under
the Democratic administration
Governor McDonald has seen fit
to retain for all practical purposes
for the supervisory authority of
the sheep industry of this state a
man wholly untrained in the
sheep industry. There can be no
defense of this notion except the
payment of a political debt at the
expense of the sheep raisers of
New Mexico, and one of the first
nets that Governor McDonald did,
after assuming the office of
governor, was to request the re
signation of Hon. Solomon Luna
as the head of that sheep sani
tary board. As to the cattle san
itary Iward we hnve no criticism
to make. We muy assume, how
ever, mat governor Mcuonnid
is a practical cattle raiser and
that in maintaining the Inch
standard of cfiicicncy with re
ference to the cattle sanitary
board, he did not forget lllá own
personal welfare.
A6AINST PENJ0NALI1IE
Wo are advised that Governor
McDonald is a great friend of
Mr. McDonald. That in the se
lection of public lands which
come to his office for his signa
ture and approval that Mr. Mc
Donald always commands imme
diate and -prompt action, while

sional work at the New Mexico
State Normal at Silver City.
For eight years she taught in
the graded schools of Kansas
City and since coming to Lincoln
County, in 1891, has been active
ly interested in the county
schools, teaching at first near

She has served four years us a

Since Mrs. Gumm has been
county school superintendent sho
has attended every imX)i-tnnt
educational meeting in the state
and is now honored with the
positions of vice president (net
ing chairman this year) of the
Educational Council, vice presi

dent's section of the New Mexico
Educational Association, and
president of the Women's Knife

Recognizing the power of
strong, well qualified teachers, it
has been Mrs. Gutnm's constant
aim to have excrienccd teachers
in each room especially with the
primary classes, that the children
might start correctly in their
studies, making sure of a strong
foundation.
In these years twenty new
buildings have been built some
in new districts and some to re

and patrons and familiarity with
school laws and customs, Mrs,
Gumm .fads she can give the
county , even better supervision
for the coming two years than
ever before and is asking for re
election solely on her record as
an official.
SENIT0RAL NOMINEE
James V. Tully's record was
fully commended by his unani
mous nomination for State Sen
ator from tho fifteenth senatorial
district, comprising the counties
of Otero, Lincoln, Socorro and
Torrance, when the republicans
considered his candidacy at their
convention in the Capital City
last week. It was fully under
stood that Lincoln County should
be honored with the nominee this
time, and the promise was made
good, and not only was this
county awarded an especial dls
Unction by this choice, but i
man was nominated who stands
pre-eminently fitted for this re
sponsibllc office one of the most
responsible in the gift of the
people. As was mentioned in
previous issue, upon the occasion
of Mr. Tully's announcement, he
has had previous experience In
tho New Mexico Legislature,
having served a term in the lower
house of that body. Further
more, ho is a successful man, nn
educated citizen, and one with
extreme popularity among all
classes of the people of the
County. He is a man of ability
and genuine statesmanship, nnd
if his election follows this strong
commendation afforded him by
the state convention, he will be
ever on the alert to champion the
cause of this section of the great
state in. particular nnd New Mexi
co in general, In Air. fully we
have a successful combination of
stockman, farmer, merchant and
statesman. Tho people recognize
his ability and will no doubt cast
an overwhelming vote in his be
half, which will most assuredly
be in their own behalf as well.
AG000 CHOICE
The nomination last week of
II. H. Hamilton to succeed him
self as district attorney of this
district was without doubt the
strongest ooost wnicn tho con
vention at Santa Fc could have
given the cause of republicanism
in this section of the state. The
convention by this nomination
has not only vindicated and tin
reservedly commended the record
of this efficient officer, but has
strengthened the party immeasur
ably since It has put before the
people for another term of office
a man who has a record which is
absolutely unimpeachable, having
served In the capacity of prose
cuting attorney without fear or
fnvor. Mr. Hamilton has known
no friends in tho honorable dis
charge of his duty, and his re
election will make for n great
blow to crime in all its forms.
Show us n district ithrnoy with
an unbroken chain of friendship
and we will show you one who
.has been lay in the discharge of
his sworn obligations to unmerci
fully pursue and prosecute nil
violations of the laws of the hind.
Hamilton canpot nut poll an en
ormous vote in these four counties
Otero, Dona Ann, Lincoln, and
Torrance, and the convention
knew mat ma nomination wus
the logical thing to do In the
perpetuation of its prestige in
this judicial district

Asks to be Sheriff Nominee
I AM IN THE RACE TO THE
FINISH" SAYS ILANCHARD
Phil. Blanchard, who makes
ofilcial announcement of his can
didacy for the office of shcrrifFin
this issue of the uutlook, needs
no recommendation to those who
know him, and nre thoroughly
acquainted with his principle of
life nnd his substantiality as a
citizen of this county. Mr. Blan
chard was born in the state of
Louisiana, but came to New Moxi
cofwith his parents when welve
years of uge, nnd has resided
hero in Lincoln County for thirty
three years. He has been engag
ed in the business of cattle and
sheep raising since 188C, at which
business he has made a pronounc
ed success. Mr. Rlanchard has
never asked for nn office before,
having preferred the prlvato life,
but his circle of friends knows
no limit, and he stands preemi
nently fitted to combat all viola
tors of the law of the common
wealth with a strong and un
flinching hand. He is a brother
of Hon. W. E. Blanchard who
served in the first New Mexico
legislature, has high ideals of
civic control and principles which
stand for order and Justice to nil
people. We commend Wm to
the voters without any reserva
tion. When interviewed by the
Outlook man nnd asked about
the re()orts circulated that he had
withdrawn from the race, Mr.
Blanchard said, "I am in the
race for sherilf of this county
und have had no intention of
making a withdrawal as has been
rumored. This rejwrt was no
doubt started by certain of m
enemies to create u fnlse impres
sion on the public. I will slay in
tho campaign to the end. 1 leav--tho
rest with my friends, th"
voters of Lincoln County."
DR. WATSON FOR TREASURER
Dr. T. W. Watson is announc
ing in this issue for re-election to
the office of treasurer which office
he has held with rare credit for
two terms As was shown in a
recent issue, through the publi
cation of the state record as to
percentage of laxos collected in
the various counties, he has ker t
Lincoln County at the head of
the list for a number of yean
past. Dr. Watson took up his
residence at Lincoln a number of
years ago where he was a practic
ing phsyician for about eight
years. Although a practicing
physician nnd registered druggist
he has devotcJ his entire tinv
to the duties of his office siiu-i'
his first election, and his careful
attention has produced a record
for efficiency of which the citizen.",
of this county may well be proud.
Moreover, Dr. Wntson is a pro
gressive booster of this count;,
and was rtmong thu first to esüiú
llsh a substantial residence in
Carrizozo. He stands for com
munity betterment In every form
nnd nlways accords generous suj -port
to ull means of progress,
lie stands solely upon his record
in office us a basis for investiga
tion by the voters who will award
the nomination for another terra
at the republican nominating
convention.
