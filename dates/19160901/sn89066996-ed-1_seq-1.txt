WHAT IS A PAGEANT?
Interesting Outline of What Our People
are Getting Ready to Pull Off on'
September 14, 15 and 16
There seems to bo latent in the I
minds of all men a love of adventure
and in the minds of ail women a love
of the picturesque. Both of these ele
ments are fused in the history of a
family, locality and nation, hence we
have poetry, drama, and in the last
years, pageants. The Farmington
Pageant aims to visualize the story of
the birth and growth of our State.
The first scene will be a presenta
tion of Indian life'on the peaceful and
domestic side ttte braves, wmcu and
children when a runner enters with
the news, "the pale face, the stranger,
is coming." In the dlstane music is
heard, and in a short time that prince
of adventurers, DeSoto, with his fol
lowers, carrying the Spanish flag and
the cross, enters upon the scene.
The spirit of manhood is always rec
ognized by those true men who pos
sess it, and at once the Red Chief and
the White Chief express themselves.
The white man, DeSoto, holds up gold
and silver, and asks if they are to be
found here. The Indians are greatly
interested, for they have never seen
these metals before, but hold up a
piece of gray lead to the surprise and
pleasure of the Spaniards. Some of
the other Spaniards see some salt
which the Indians had piled up, and
are greatly pleased, for they were in
need of it. This is one epoch of our
history.
The second scent has a poetic tinge,
gathered from our beloved poet Long
fellow: Evangeline and Basil, with an
Indian guide, pass this way in search
of Gabriel.
Scene third gives us our share of
the great Louisiana Purchase history,
and will be beautifully represented.
The fourth scene will be an inter
esting picture of the early settlers j
from 1799 to the torming ol tne Mur-1
phy Settlement, out of which grew
Farmington. The older people will
think of the past, the younger will
look with wonder at the earlier life
of that magnificent man and woman
the pioneer
Tha fifth scene will be more of a
tableau representing that veryjm-
portant event, the presenting by 'Da-,
vid Murphy of 62 acres of ground for j
,i seat of iustice. thus making Farm-;
ington the County Seat of St. Francois
County.
Tim sixth scene will be a tableau
oortravinc Farmington surrounded by
fT -'i i n.- n
ncr SISier LUWIIH ui (.lie cvuuijr, an
represented by young women and girls
who personify the beauty of an ideal
community. i
The seventh scene will be of a
mystical character, combining the
past and present, in which the future
Farmington is a veiled figure clothed
in the roseate color of hope, surround-
Clean-Up Day
Saturday, September 2, has been
designated by the State Superintend
ent of Schools as official clean-up day
for the schools of the State.
All patrons, school officers and
teachers should on this date join forc
es in making the school premises neat
and healthful for the boys and girls
of Missouri.
The school yard should be cleared
of all weeds and rubbish. The out
houses should be whitewashed or
painted and repaired and a supply of
lime placed at the disposal of the
teacher for disinfecting purposes. The
drinking water should be carefully ex-j
Hjnined and it it is not louna bdso-
lutely pure the well should be
thoroughly cleaned out and fresh wa-1
ter hauled. The well top should be
put in such condition that waste and
ed by joyous, happy children, symbol
'"ne the hope of our town for its pro
gress in honor, power, prosperity and
truth. Around these m a grand
march is grouped the past history,
making a Pageant picture of beauty
to stir the soul to effort and to joy.
The concert evening of the festivi
ties will be a delightful feature. Mr.
Barroll, director of the concert, re
ports that the artists throughout the
county asked to participate in the
concert have very generously and will
ingly promised their mjlp, so that at

the three nights will easily get the
worth of their money from this con

Excellent Prospects for Ban

The Ozark Business College of
Farmington will open for the twelfth
year, Tuesday, September 5th. The
management informs us that pros
pects for a banner year in attendance
and results are evident, and we pre
dict a very interesting session for this
enterprising institution.
In this age or excitement and movc

.and provides plenty of material for
inspiration and enthusiasm.
The young people of Southeast Mis-1
souri should feel justly proud of the
opportunity offered to secure a High-1
Grade Business or Shorthand Educa-1
tion, practically at home, and every
young man and young woman who is
ambitious and desirous to get the
most out of life should interest him-
self in work that is congenial that
puts them in touch with the big
things of business that identifies
them with managerial work.
In other words, does it pay to be !
able to side-step the hopeless search- j
ing for a job the endless waiting I
the humiliating interviews accorded
the untrained? Therefore we advise
that you let those who know who
have been through it all, advise you
and train you for a successful career.
You have the right to picture your
self a year from now a successful ap- j
plicant for a position in a bank, hs a
railroad office, manufacturing firm,
, , , . . ,
- reaL or one hundred other en
terprises, because you will have tre
ability to do things that ought to be
done in these places, and because you
have behind you the power and influ
ani'A of this valuable school.
Getting a start in business is half
the battle to success, and a very sim
ple action will jump you immediately
Into the successful class. That ac
tion is today to write a letter like
this: "You may register me as a stu
dent to begin next Tuesday, Septem
ber 5th."
That decision insures you the tech
nical skill in business, and a chance
to begin an association with a Busi
ness Firm where salary increased will
depend only upon your voluntary ef
fort. The institution has the moral sup
port and good wishes of every bus
iness man in Farmington, and it is
but natural that we all wish for the
Ozark its "banner year."
New Piano Store
For Farmington
W. A. Gillam, who has since the
first of this year established an envi
able reputation throughout the Lead
Belt as a dealer in pianos, as well as
being an expert piano tuner, was in
Farmington Monday to secure a bus
iness location in this city, where he
will open a piano store for the pur
pose of putting in a large stock of
high grade instruments, which he ex
pects to have open to the public about
September 1st. He now has a piano
house both in Flat River and Bonne
Terre, where he is doing a thriving
business.
Mr. Gillam knows the needs and de
mands of this community, and intends
to carry in his house at this place the
highest grade pianos that are manu
factured. As he buys direct from the
manufacturers, he will be able to save
to the purchaser several middlemen's
profit which the average dealer must
charge up to the final customer. Mr.
Gillam has had many years experi
ence in. the piano business, and will
therefore be in a position to absolutely
guarantee every instrument he sells.
Read his announcement in this issue
of The Times.
Steers at $80 a Head
W. B. Rariden last Saturday attend
ed the Joe Boyd sale, in Ste. Genevieve
county, where he purchased 25 head of
2-year-old steers, for which he paid j
$80 per head.
To one who is not familiar with the !
cattle market, such a price may ap-1
pear to be "impossible," but no one
knows or understands the live stock
market better than does Mr. Rariden,
who is in no wise discouraged with this
investment. These are Democratic

men now for what they lost ? That is
what I would do. every penny of it, or
allow them to take stock at par."
But whatever differences of opin
ion mfej exist among the stockholders
as to how the extra dividend from the
reserve for amortization should have
been applied, this fact sticks out large
ly that the company is in a very pros
perous c mdition and is making mon
ey on get-rich-quick schedule. Dem
ocratic limes are not such bad times
after all. Now waU-h some Republi

Chautauqua
Next Year
A very successful Chautauqua sea
son came to a close Saturday evening.
The scries of entertainments covered
a perin I of five days, including ten

greatly enjoyed by all present. While
these entertainments have been ren
dered, it is quite apparent that there
still remains in the hearts of the pa
trons much of good as a result of
them. A good Chautauqua has an ed
ucational, edifying, uplifting and en
nobling effect upon all who attend
them,

best commendation that can be offered
for this year's program. Farming
ton and ((immunity is unquestionably
benefited from having had presented
last week the commendable five days
Chautauqua program, which should
continue to bear fruit throughout the
lives (' all those who were privileged
to attend.
One of the numbers for Saturday
afternoon was a "dress up" program
by the children who had been enjoying
"funfests" during the week under
the Chautauqua play specialist, Miss
Myrtle Parkes. This performance
was to have been given on the Court
House sireen, but owing to threatened
rain, the hall in the Tetley block was
substituted. There was given sam
ples of how the children had been em
ploying an hour each day under the
direction of Miss Parkes, and most
satisfying were the "samples" to pa
rents and friends of the participants.
In fact, many pronounced it the most
enjoyable of the entire series of Chau
tauqu. entertainments. The hall was
so crowded by the parents and friends
of the participants, that the "play
ground" was too circumscribed to per
mit the girls and boys to do their
best work. But it was entirely satis
factory, and demonstrated the fact
that Miss Parke ranks high as a
"play specialist."
Badly Injured
Clell Riney, a lad of 13 or 14 years,
met with a frightful injury Friday af
ternoon at the home of Tim McCarthy,
while he was assisting his brother,
who drives the auto delivery for th
Klein Grocer Co. The lad had carried
an order into the McCarthy home, and
was running in order to save every
possible moment, as Saturday deliver
ies for this store necessitates speed.
There is a shoe scraper near the door,
and the walk being rather slick, the
lad fell as he was attempting to step
over the scraper, catching his left leg
on one of the sharp projecting prongs
of the scraper, and almost tearing the
entire calf of the leg loose.
The leg was frightfully torn, but
prompt attention from a surgeon soon
had it properly dressed, and the lad
is now getting along remarkably well,
and the prospects are good for his ear
ly recovery from his injury.
A Good Sale
The public sale held last Friday, by
Sheriff J. C. Williams, at his farm,
one-and-a-half miles north of Libcr
tyville, was one of the most success
ful in every respect, that has been held
in St. Francois county during this en
tire year. A big crowd was in at
tendance, among whom were many
bidders, which resulted in a very sat
isfactory sale.
Nothing but live stock was sold,
but practically all of this went from
this unusually well equipped farm.
"Joe's" health is such that he did not
feel like giving of his time that pro
per care that live stock demands, hence
his decision to make a complete clean
up, which included much of the fr.icst
stock to be found in the county. The
receipts from the sale were about
$8,200, in cash and notes- A good
dinner was served on the grounds, and
it was not only a profitable occasion
to all buyers, but an enjoyable time
for all.
$2,000 Fine for
"Bootlegging'
Last Tuesday Tony Borasky wns ar
raigned before Justice Ramsey at Flat
River on information of Prosecuting
Attorney Davis, charging him with
violation of the local option law. He
was found guilty on two charges, and
his punishment assessed at a fine of
$2,000 and two years in jail. Boras
ky appealed his case to the Circuit
Court.
SECURE CITY PARK
Though Farmington is a Charming
Little City We Should Not Neglect
to Add to Its Beauty
In this Hay of civic
improvement,
when there is unusually more or less
friendly rivalry between many towns
to outdistance others in the matter of
ndding to their attractiveness, an eye
should always be kept open for any
thing that will bring the "home town"
even one step nearer to the "City
Beautiful."
While allowing our thought to ram
ble along this line, the writer's atten
tion has been drawn to the fact that
notwithstanding the very apparent
beauty of Farmington its dustless

kept lawns this city is destitute of

Democratic Com
mittee Meeting
A meeting of the Democratic Coun
ty Central Committee was held in the
Circuit Court room last Saturday af
ternoon, with Chairman Parkhurst
Sleeth presiding, and Francis A. Ben
ham, as Secretary. No business of
general importance was transacted,
and nothing was given out. There will
be another meeting of the County
Committee, however, on next Mon
day, September 4th, when important
party matters will probably be acted
upon. There will also be a visiting
member of the State Committee in at
tendance at that meeting.
A number f mergers 0f the County
Comnuuee wce iu attendance at Sat
Hi-day's meeting, among whom were:
J. L. Cleveland of Doe Run, H. L. Gri

S. E. Sharrock of Libertyville, and J.
H. Malugen of Bonne Terre.
A Shooting Affray
A shooting affray, fortunately with
out fatalities, occurred at Flat River
about 5 o'clock last Sunday afternoon.
The scene of the trouble was opposite
the Miners Supply Co. store. W. H.
Whaley there met Irvin AuBuchon,
who was accompanied by his father-in-law,
Cleve Francis. Whalev ac
cused AuBuchon of ruining his sister,
Myrtle,
in years old. under promise
Of marriage, threatening to kill him
it he ret used.
AuBuchon did not appear to relish
the suggested trip, and Whaley drew
a revolver. Francis then got between
the two younger men, while Whaley
fired one shot withuot effect. In the
meantime Harold, a 16-year-old son
of Francis, who had witnessed the dif
ficulty from in front of his home, a
short distance away, thinking that
Whaley had shot at his father, ran in
to the house and secured a sot gun
and fired two shots at Whaley, who
responded with three shots at the boy,
none of which did any damage.
AuBuchon had Whaley arrested on
the charge of assault to kill. Whaley
also had young Francis arrested on a
similar charge. Myrtle Whaley, over
whom the trouble arose, had AuBu
chon arrested, charged with seduction
under promise of marriage. The
principals in all three cases were giv
en preliminary hearings on Monday
before 'Squire Ramsey, which result
ed in Whaley and AuBuchon being
bound over to the next term of Cir
cuit Court for trial, and their bonds
were fixed at $1,000 each.
The State dismissed the case of
Harold Francis, on the theory that he
.was warranted in his actions, through
appearances, in his desire to protect
his father.
It afterwards developed that before
the trouble, W. F. Lawrence had call
ed Whaley into his store and plead
with him not to cause any trouble, but
to permit the law to take its course in
redressing the alleged wrongs to his
sister. But Whaley seemed determin
ed to avenge the wrong he alleged had
been done his sister, going directly
from there to the scene of the trouble.
AuBuchon stoutly maintains his in
nocence of any wrong-doing. He had
but a few days prior to the trouble
married a daughter of Cleve Francis.

would be given a very moderate price
on this tract of land for the purpose
of converting it into a permanent

Hull and Ross
May Be Parolled
Judge Huck was here last Saturday
and he and Prosecuting Attorney Da
vis went over and considered the va
rious petitions, letters and appeals for
parole of Wm. Rosb and Oscar Hull,
who are serving terms in jail for
"bootlegging," as well as the protests
made against granting a parole.
The petitions arc for an immediate
parole and have been on file for more
than two months. Mr. Davis declined
to recommend and Judge Huck to
grant an immediate parole, but after
considering all the facts in connection
with the cases as well asevidence fur-
nishd that the health of the men was
ueieiwaung rapidly afio that one of
them (Hull) is predisposed to tuber
cular trouble, they determined that if
Hull and Ross would each pay the
court costs and comply with other
conditions that a parole would be
granted them on the 9th day of Sep
tember. The conditions of the parole are as
follows: (1) Payment of all court
costs standing against them. (2)
The signing of an agreement and
bond that they will not again violate
any of the criminal laws of the State,
and particularly the law relating to
the illegal sale of liquor; and (3)
That they will each remove from the
county and remain away for the peri
od of one year.
Both of the men pleaded guilty, but
Judge Huck and Mr. Davis each de
clared that the clemency to be ex-
tended them is not to be considered as
a precedent; that each case as it
comes up will be determined upon the
facts surrounding it.
Hull and Ross have been in jail
since the 10th day of May, and will,
on the 9th of September, have served
approximately three-fourths of a
six-months' jail sentence.
