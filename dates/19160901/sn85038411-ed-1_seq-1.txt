TIME TO STOP STRIKE
House to Vote on Adamson Bill, Which Is Considered
Satisfactory hy Brotherhood Heads, Late Today;
Legislation to Be Rushed to Completion by Satur

fore Monday at 7 a. m.
SENATE IS CONCENTRATING ON EIGHT
HOUR DAY BILL; POSTPONES OTHER LAWS
Interstate Commission May Be Empowered to Fix Schedule
of Wages on Railroads; Enlargement Bill Will Not Be
Attached to Special Legislation on Account of Oppo
sition; Congress May Adjourn Wednesday
Washington. Sept. I.—Bills to avert the railway strike actually
were put on their way to passage to-day in both houses of Congress.
Under a special ruling provided for a vote not later than 4.30
this afternoon the House took up the Adamson eight-hour bill ap
proved by President Wilson and accepted by brotherhood leaders
as a "satisfactory settlement."
The Senate Interstate Commerce Commission reported a similar
bill which, however, contains an important provision empowering
the Interstate Commerce Commission to fix schedules of wages on
inter-State railways. It provides that the eight-hour day shall
become effective January I. 1917, that the present pay for the ten
hour day shall apply to the shorter day, that overtime shall be paid
pro rata but adds that within not less than six and not more than
twelve months after its passage, the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion shall assume jurisdiction of the question of hours and wages
and that they shall be subject to petition for change from either the
employers, the employes and the public.
Text of Provision
The text of that provision is as fol
lows:
That the Interstate Commerce
C r.mmission shall have the power
to fix the hours of labor and pre
scribe just and reasonable wages
for all employes of the railroads.
* * * The rate of wages and the
hours of labor provided l'or in this
act shall remain fixed for service
and pay until changed by the de
cision of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, which, within a pe
riod of not less than six nor more
thai, twelve months from the
passage of this act. shall deter
mine what are just and reason-
Rble wages and what shall bo the
hours of labor for all employes of
the railroads above mentioned.
The Interstate Commerce Com
mission shall have the power from
time to time to change the hours
tf labor and the rate of wages for
>ll employes of the railroads
* * * either in whole or in part,
prescribed by it on its own
initiative, on the petition of the
employes, the managers of the
railroads or the public.
The possibility of a hitch seemed to
oe in this added provision, which is
being studied by the brotherhood
leaders.
Eliminate Freight Increase
The committee eliminated the pro
posal that on the report of the eight
hour day commission the Interstate
Commerce Commission shall consider
an increase of freight rates to meet
such additional expenditures by the
railroads affected as may have been
rendered necessary by the adoption of
the eight-hour day.
Neither of the two pending bill*
contains the Canadian commission
plan, which the labor leaders oppose,
and neither contains the government
operation provision. President Wilson
is willing to let those features wait
until after enough legislation to avert
the strike has been enacted.
Republicans Framing Bill
Senate Republicans decided to-day
to frame a bill of their own and offer
it as a substitute for the administra-

King Constantine of Greece Abdicates Throne in Favor of Crown Prince

to draft it. No serious opposition
to the administration plan was ex
pected. however.
Senator LaFollette, quitting the po
litical campaign, suddenly returned to
the Capitol to-day to take a hand in
the legislation. He said he could not
tell what his attitude toward the pend
ing hills would be until he had inves
tigated them.
The time for passage of the bills
is so short that a filibuster might ser
iously interfere with the program.
Democratic leaders, however, do not
expect one and were confident the pro
gram would go through in time.
President Wilson told members of
his Cabinet at to-day's meeting that
there was every prospect that the leg
islation would be passed by both
Houses of Congress before to-morrow
night.
General Debate Begins
Representatives Caldwell, of New
York; Borland, of Missouri, and Ra
ker. of California. Democrats, urged
a strong vote in favor of the bill.
Representative Lenroot, of Wis
consin, Republican, amid applause on
the Democratic side, announced he
expected to vote for the bill. Many
others spoke briefly on both sides.
The rule was adopted without a rec
ord vote and general debate on the
bill itself then began.

At 2 o'clock Senator Newlands in
troduced the revised Senate bill and
it was formally referred to the inter

Newlands said that the committee
would report finally within a short

the Senate in session until the whole
subject was disposed of even if it
should extend the session far into the

and members of Congress to carefully
consider pending legislation aimed at
prevention of the railroad strike, was
passed by the board of directors of the
Harrirfburg Chamber of Commerce
this morning.
Copies were wired President Wil
son. Senators Penrose and Oliver and
to Congressman Aaron S. Kreider.
The resolution reads:
"The Harriaburg Chamber of Com
merce deems it utterly inconsistent
with the principles of our government
j and against the best interests of our
I people that legislation in the pending
railroad crisis should be passed hur
; ritdly and. without time and oppor
tunity for proper consideration of the
many complex questions involved.
'We protest against any legislation
that does not safeguard the principle
of arnltration of all questions involv
ing wages and employment."

Is Prepared to Feed
Harrisburg For Three
Months, Says Hibier
"So far as the packinghouse end
of It is concerned we are prepared to
feed Harrisburg in the event of a rail
| road strike for three full months at
j least even if not another piece of
i goods or head of stock were shipped
| into our plant here," said C. A. Hib
| ler of Swift & Co., to-day.
! "Few people know it," he con
tinued, "but our normal stock on hand
| is from one to two million pounds con
j stantly. This is a shipping point for
| the whole coast and consequently if
! our shipments were cut off we would
have more than enough to care for
j any local wants. In addition we have
anticipated possibilities and have laid
: in an additional supply and our yards
{ are crowded with several hundred
i head of cattle beside the meat in
storage. There is absolutely no dan
| ser. Swift and Company are looking
after their Harrisburg trade and are
I prepared to meet any conditions."
! All Harrisburg Schools
Closed Until October 2
Pulilie schools of the city will not be
reopened until Monday, October 2 in
order to minimize the risk of a spread
of infantile paralysis.
The school board in regular session
this afternoon fixed that date by
adopting the recommendation of City
Superintendent F. E. Downes to that
effect. Dr. Downes' recommendations
were made in accordance with the re
cent order of State Health Commis
sioner Samuel Dixon.
In making his recommendations Dr.
Downes points out that only a small
proportion of the pupils in the ele
mentary schools are sixteen or over,
while in the high schools most of the
students are over sixteen.
; The school committee made no re
port on the new high school problem
as this matter will not be referred to
the directorate until several more
meetings with the citizens' commit
tee are held.
