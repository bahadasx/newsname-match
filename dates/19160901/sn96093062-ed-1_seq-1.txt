Congress expects to by Saturday have passed legislation to
meet the situation, keeping the men at work and trains moving un
til a definite sottlomcnt of the matter; also every effort is being
brought by administration officials on tho heads of the brother

$ EPITOME OP VIEWS OP
S BOTH SIDES ON THE
S"H WILSON PROPOSAL
Four hundred thousand
empolyos are involved In the
affair, and they have a big
strike fund available at onco
amounting to $15,000,000; to
pay each man $40 per month
as long as assistance is need
ed. Thoy anticipate that it
willnot need to "be touched.
Several of the largest rail
road systems in the United
States have for some time
been successfully In operation
under tho same conditions
now demanded by the rail
road employes In this strug
gle. fTt the eight-hour day.
fle efgfit-hour'day ls"are '
quest for a wage increase to
tho same extent that all simi
lar concessions on the part of
omployors has given.
Tho strike Is ordered for
Monday, September 4th (La
bor Day), though tho hour of
the day has not been publicly
specified.
Upon notification of the
order to strike, every road
employe will leave his train
at the nearest junction point
and leave everything in first
class condition, and will. Im
mediately leave the property
grounds of the company and
In no way trespass upon thd
same or interfere in any man
ner with the company's af
fairs. Heads of famllha are lay
ing In supplies in the way of
groceries, etc., anticipating a
shortage of provisions should
the strike affect merchants.
Businej s concerns in the
affected region are doing all
In their power to store, up the
necessary things which will
onable them to conduct their
affairs during a period of In
ability to get goods by rail.
Fifteen thousand National
guardsmen have been order
returned to several States. No
significance as regards strike
1 thought of apparently. The
troops, however, 1U have to
move hurriedly, and It may be
the government will have to
assume control pf roads.

Following Is an epitome of
views hold by railroad mana
ge'rsjind railroad brothorhood
chiefs on the six proposals
of President Wilson: ,
1. Brotherhoods are pas
slvo regarding any plan to
enlarge membership and wid
en scope of the Interstate
commerce commission. Rail
roads whole-heartedly ap
prove the suggestion.
2. Brotherhoods unani
mously want establishment
of an eight-hour day by law.
Some thing such action wotf'd
prevent tho strike. , Rall-

ing to the ship from shore leave ha
been drowned. Tho Unltod State'
cruiser Mempflis formerly was the
armored cruiser Tennessee. Hot
name was changed on the 20th oi
last May. Recently she has been
doing duty in San Domingo waters
in connection with tho revolution.
FEATURES AT THE COUNTY FAIR
Tho amusement feature at the
Bryan County Fair at Durant on Sep
tember 14, 15, and 16, aro going to
bo better than over this year, and
this, with tho-many exhibits, $3,000
in prizes, and overy person In the
county taking an interest, isgoinr
to mnko this the biggest county fair
in tho State.
A roping contest will bo held each
afternoon, and tho biggest purse
ovor hung up in thiB section will bo
given the winners. A carload of
wild Mexioan four-year-old steers
havo boon ordered for this event, nnd
ropers from many sections will bp
on hand to contost for first monev.
A big carnival company, with a
wild west show, a '49 show, a nogro
mlnstrol, an athletic show, a fat man,
a tall man, a human wawflsh, the
spider lady with a woman's head
and a spider's body, and many more
shows -will bo on hand. Also a fine
merry-go-round for the children of
all ages. (
These features, In addition to the
regular races, parade, and another
big free attraction, which the fair
association is on a deal for, promises
to mnko this tho moct interesting
ontortaining and educational event
over held in this section. Everyono
in the county should attend for it
least one day. Prepare to take your
family and have a good time.
'roads havo made thelf ' chief
fight against this proposition.
3. Brotherhoods not con
cerned greatly over the ap
pointment of a commission to
study effects of an eight-hour
day on operation costs. Rail
roads desire such a commis
sion if the eight-hour day
law law is Inevitable.
4. Brotherhoods oppose
In principle only suggestion
that Congress explicitly ap
prove interstate commerce
commission consideration of
Increased freight rates; be
lieve the roads are making
enough now to grant the de
mand. Railroads favor any
move to .give them Increased
freight rates, but are doubtful
of results of such considera
tion. 5. Brotherhoods actively
oppose as un-American, forc
ing men to work when thoy
don't want to," which, they
say, would result by the crea
tion of a commjsslon to in
vestigate labor disputes, with
the proviso that tho strike
would be unlawful during
any Investigation. Railroads
poecifically asked for such a
commission.
6. Brotherhoods do not
appose giving the President
power to operate trains in tho
event of military necessity;
provided only trains for mili
tary purposes aro thus oper
ated Railroads favor any
measure that will keep trains
running If the strike occurs.-
