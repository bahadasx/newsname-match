fOR VOTE ON MEASURE
LATE THIS AFTERNOON
Garretson Confers With
President Wilson, But
Makes no Comment.
REPUBLICANS TO
FORM NEW BILL
Want Measure of Their own
Designed to Avert Na
tion-wide Strike.
Washington. Sept. 1.—Both houses
•f congress had under consideration
today measures virtually Identical,
which are expected to result in re
scinding the orders for a railroad
strike Monday.
ADHIWSTRAHON OffKMS TODAY
EXPECT STRIKE TO Bf CAllfl) Off,
ADAMSON Btll FAVORABLY REPORTED
When the bodies met, it was be
lieved that bills will be passed within
24 hours, establishing an eight-hour
day for trainmen in interstate railway
commerce and providing for the cre
ation of a commission to study the
effect.
Wilson went to the e&pHol thiaj
morning to confer with senate and
house leaders. "He planned to urge
as
much speed as possible in both hous
es.
The bills provide for the payment
of pro-rata wages for time over eight
hours, and both would have an in
vestigating commission of three mem
bers, appointed by the president, to
report its recommendations in from
six to nine months after the law be
comes effective.
Garretson, spokesman for the rail
road brotherhoods, held a brief con
ference with Wilson today. When he
left the White House, he refused to
tell why he called.
White House officials said Garret
son gave Wilson "some information."
There is every indication that the
administration expected the strike to
be called off before Sunday morning.
With the provision authorizing the
Interstate Commerce Commission to
fix schedules of wages on the nil
roads, the senate Interstate Com
merce committee favorably reported
the eight-hour bill.
Republican senators in conference
decided to draft legislation of their
own to offer as a substitute for that
proposed by the democrats to avert
the strike.
House leaders expected a vote on
the Adamson bill late this afternoon.
Bin In Senate.
The senate interstate commerce
committee Reported a similar bill,
which, however, contains an impor
tant provision empowering the inter
state commerce commission to fix
schedules of wages on Interstate rail
ways. The bill provided that the
hour day shall* become effective Jan
uary 1. l»lt. and that the present
pay for a 10-hour day will he paid
pro rata, but adds that within not less
than six and not over twelve months
after its passage, the interstate com
merce commission shall assume jur
isdiction of the question of hours and
wages and that they shall be subject
to petition for a change from either
employers, employes and the public.
Canadian Feature Excluded.
Neither of the two pending bills
contali.s the Canadian commission
plan, which labor leaders oppose, and
neithor contains the government op
eration provision. Wilson is willing
to let those features wait until after
enough legislation to avert the strike
thas been enacted.
Bills to avert the railroad strike
actually were put on the way to pas
sage in both houses of congress to
day.
Under a special rule, providing a
vote not later than 4 30 today, the
house took up the Adamson eight
hour bill approved by President Wil
son and accepted by brotherhood
'leaders as "a satisfactory settlement."
Revised Bill.
Senator Newlands this afternoon in
troduced the revised senate bill,
which was formally referred to the
interstate oommerce committee.

London, Sept. 1.—Five successive
attacks were made by German troops
last night on British positions on the
Somme front.
The war office announced today that
the Germans penetrated the British
defenses on a small frontage at two
points between Ginchy and Highwood.
Washington, Sept. 1.—Representa
tives of the railroads, of the train
men's brotherhoods and of shippers'
organizations argued for nine hours
yesterday before the senate interstate
commerce committee on legislation
proposed to avert the threatened
strike, recompense the roads for any
added financial burden, and perfect
machinery to make Impossible In the
future another crisis like the present.
Last night the committee worked un
til late on a bill to be presented to the
senate today.
Out of the nine hours' argument
two facte stood clearly. In the esti
mation of all effected parties congress
alone can prevent a strike, and the
public eventually will foot the hill for
an eight-hour day with ten hours' pay
which the trainmen demand- The
railroad executives and the shippers
Insisted that the strike order should
at least be postponed and the four
brotherhood chiefs declared ..with.
equal vehemence it could not be:'
All sides apparently were more or
less satisfied with the hearing which
had given thefts an opportunity to lay
their cases before the public.
Pmunatlc Scene.
A dramatic scene, In which A. B.
Garretson, spokesman for the train
men and president of the Order of
Railway Conductors, was the central
figure, brought the nearing to a
climax last night shortly before the
taking of testimony closed.
Throughout the day members of the
committee at different times had ask
ed the four brotherhood heads if they
were powerless to stop the strike save
by repotting a satisfactory settlement
to the men. The question invariably
was evaded, the replies being that Mr.
Garretson would explain the situation
before the hearing closed.
For almost an hour Mr. Garretson
kept the crowd laughing with quaint
expressions and humorous stories.

KING CONSTANTINE OF GREECE ABDICATES—REVOLT UNDER WAY
Articles of Incorporation Filed—Result Long Period of Investigation—Elaborate
Plans Made for Carrying on the Work—Means Great Thing for the
Farmers bf the State.
Articles were filed yesterday with the secretary of state for the incorporation of
a co-operative business organization, winch when its plans work out will be of gTeat
benefit in the development of North Dakota. The name of the new organization is the
Northern Packing company, and its business, as set forth in its articles, is to deal in
livestock and farm products, to own and operate cold storage plants, to own and oper
ate a packing house for slaughter, dressing, curing and storage of meats and the manu
facture of packing house products and to Own and operate feeding and stock yards.
The Northern Packing company is capitalized at $500,000 and its organizers are
North Dakota men who hope to develop a home market for North Dakota hogs, cattle
and sheep. The directors named in the articles filed at Bismarck name the following men
as the first board of directors of the new organization:
company will expect to pay back tn
dividends to its stockholders, the
handsome profits which are now going
elsewhere.
The men who are behind the new
company have not proceeded hastily
in the worktqk 'out of their plans.
The packing plaint idea originated
with the farmers themselves. In the
beginning it w^s committees of farm
ers from the .'3ufctry districts, asking
the local Commercial club for mar
kets. that led' that organization to
take up activity the plans for such
plants. For more than eighteen
months constant investigation has
been conducted-ty the club with the
result above' notted. About a year ago
the' of directors of the
Commercial club visited plants in
Iowa and Minnesota In order to in
form themselves at first hand upon
the subject. It has been found that
there are more than 3,600 packing
plants in successful operation in this
country and that about 1,800 of these
have a capitalisation of $50,000 or
over. Further it has been found that
where the packing industry is care
fully managed and has expert han
dling that it is almost Invariably very
profitable. The Northern Packing
company has already arranged for a
thoroughly competent general man
ager of long experience in the packing
business and other needs of the busi
ness have been anticipated and ad
vance arrangement made to care for
them.
The new company starts out under
most encouraging conditions. Requests
BANK HEARING
IS HELD IN
FARGOTODAY
Grand Forks in Favor of
Linking North Dakota
With Eastern States.
(Herald Special Service.)
Fargo, N. D.. Sept. 1.—Pleading
advantages of their respective cities
for the location of a federal land
loan bank, representatives of Fargo,
Miriot, Bismarck and Grand Forks,
went before that board here today.
Three proposed groupings—one In
cluding Minnesota, North and South
Dakota and Montana, advocated by
Fargo, one consisting of North and
South Dakota, Montana and Wyo
ming, advanced by Bismarck and Ml
not. and another including North and
South Dakota with Minnesota and
Wisconsin, advocated by Grand Forks
—were laid before the board.
For Fargo, the plea was made that
this city is the center of the "spring
wheat" area, that the products in the.
four states proposed, are very simllaft
that the rural needs are almost li
tlcal, that land values run very nttju
the same, and that the opportunli
for handling business are the
here. Bismarck and Minot both
vanoed the cry that they are in
center of rapidly developing area*
where the demand for land loans will
be Increasing greatly. Grand Ftorks
representatives gave little attention
to the question of location of the
bank Itself, declaring, however^ In
favor of linking this state with the
states lying to the east The 'Grind
Forks representatives contended tjjat
the advantage to the land owners In
being linked with Minnesota, Wiscon
sin or Iowa were great. In that It
would put the farm properties in this
state on about the same basis, as in
these states, so far as the geenral Im
pression in the east Is concerned.

London, Sept. 1.—King
Constantine of Greece has
abdicated, according to the
British official press repre
sentatives at Saloniki. The
press representative says the
king abdicated in favor of
the crown prince with Veni
zelos as the power behind
the throne. The new policy,
he reports, will be to work
with the Entente Allies.

Constantine abdication dis

On Tuesday, Price sent from Salon

from Athens to LArissa. This dis
patch was discredited in London offi

be cast on its correctness by dis
patches filed from Athens Wednesday,,
one telling of the coming meetings
between the king and the Entente
ministers, and others having to do
with the illness of the king who re
cently underwent a slight operation.
It is possible, however, that the king
departed secretly from Athens as re

assistance of Greece.
There are various rumors here re
garding the situation in Greece. Salon
iki reports say there is fighting be
tween the Greek garrison at Saloniki
and the Greek volunteers recently
organised to assist the Greek regulars,
who are resisting the Bulgarians in
Macedonia.
French troops intervened to sup

ally surrendered and marched out of
Saloniki.

Fighting occurred in Saloniki. the
correspondent adds, but serious trou

of soldiers of the Entente Allies.
"The revolution olaimed Its first vic

Macedonian volunteers surrounded
the barracks of the Greek Infantry
