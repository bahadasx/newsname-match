"C. M. BABCOCK OF HIGHWAY
COMMISSION SATS MATTER
IS DEFINITELY SETTLED
No more worry need be felt as to
the route of the Jefferson Highway
through Minnesota, as C. M. Babcock
of the state highway commission, in
an interview with Dr. E. W. Kaliher
of this city while here for a short
lime yesterday noon, stated that the
route has been selected by the Jeffer
son Highway commission and the
state highway commission will have
nothing more to do with it.
Mr. Babcock came up here over
the Jefferson Highway in company
•with another gentleman from St.
Paul. In the course of his conversa
tion with Mr. Kaliher, who has known
Mr. Babcock since boyhood, he said
that the roads between the twin cit
ies and this city were in fine ishape
and he expressed himself as well sat
isfied that the central route was se
lected, and that he believed C. I. Mc
Nair of Cloquet, another member of
the highway comnr&sion, was also
satisfied with the outcome.
Upon being approached in regard to
the action of the commission in refus-l
ing to recognize the Jefferson High-j
way, Mr. Babcock said that they had
refused to recognize it and that they
do not intend to. The commission
has not recognized any other trail
that has come through this state, he
isaid, a« the commission felt that the
matter was purely one for the organ
ization behind it. Hereafter the com
mission will have nothing to do with,
the designation of routes for any sim
ilar highways in thi6 state.
In speaking of the value of the cen
tral route as compared with the loop
troute, Mr. Babcock agreed that this
route covers the most territory in
the shortest distance, that it is the
most economical route, from the
standpoint Of material and all-around
the-vear service and upkeep, and that
this route had the greatest mileage of
good roadway already constructed.
From here Mr. Babcock and his
companion left over the Jefferson
iHighway for Staples. They intended
to go to Brainerd.
^POTATOES SELLING AT RECORD
PRICE
Potatoes are the highest now that
they have been at this time of the
year in many years, owing to the scar
city. the potato crop being a failure,
according to local grocers. The re
tail price yesterday was $1.10 per
bushel and potato buyers, while not
Graying potatoes now because of the
fact that not many are being brought
to town, say that if they could get
•enough for a carload they ,uld very
well pay $1.00 per bushel for them. In
years when the potato crop lias been
.good the price has been as low is 20
cents per bushel at this time of the
year.

VOL. 28 NO. 26 I2TTLE FALLS, MORRISON COUNTY, MINNESOTA
IS YOUR PANTRY FILLED?
GROCERIES ENOUGH IN TOWN
FOR 3 TO 5 WEEKS—GASO
LINE SUPPLY IS GOOD
What will we do in Little Falls if
the threanted railroad strike goes
into effect Monday?" is A very com
mon query heard on the streets and
everywhere now. The heads of the
railroads have intimated that they
will be able to handle the situation
without seriously crippling the ser
vice, but the people nevertheless are
very anxious to know how the supply
of food, gasoline, etc., is going to
hold out.
An effort was made yesterday by a
Herald representative to get a line
on this, and this is what he learned:
That the local grocers are in a posi
tion to supply the local trade with
groceries from three to five weeks,
providing the demand is normal.
However, they anticipate a big rush
on the principal foodstuffs and in sueh
event the supply would be crippled
in a week to ten days. Perishable goods
would last only a day or two. From
now on the grocers will not accept
big orders. No more sugar is being
sold by the sack.
The gasoline supply is pretty good
here. Two local agents have in all
about 25,000 gallons and the garages
and hardware stores have from 2^0 to
1,000 gallons. This, it is estimated,
will last fifteen to twenty days. Af
ter that not a wheel would be moving,
it is thought.
In other lines the strike will not
make much difference. The meat mar
kets will be able to supply their pa
trons with meat except in the canned
goods, etc., which they do not pre
pare themselves.
The telegraph and telephone will
do a big business in event of the
strike, as tne mail service will be
crippled and a great deal oi business
correspondence will have to be done
in this way.
Geo. T. Slade, first vice-president of
the Northern Pacific, has sent out an
announcement stating that after Sept.
4 the company will not be responsible
for delays to travelers that non-per
ishable goods will be accepted for
shipment subject to delay that the
company will try to provide trans
portation necessary for the health and
subsistance of the communities serv
ed that the company will move at
least one train each way daily over
•its main lines for the transportation
of passengers, mail and express that
these activities will be gradually ex
tended so far as practicable.

ELKS TEAM TO TRY CONCLUSIONS
WITH SWANVILLE AT THE
FAIR GROUNDS
Sunday afternoon the baseball lovers
of this city will be given the opportun
ity of witnessing several old timers
play baseball. Among them are Al.
Dominick, former pitcher for the local
all- salaried team, Charles Sylvester,
who used to hold down the first sack
Alfred Stoll, our old second baseman,
Edw. Berg, the pinch hitter, and sev
eral others. It's going to be in the
game between the Elks team of this
city and the Swanville Regulars, at
the fair grounds, beginning at 3:30 p.
m.
Last Sunday the Elks trimmed
Swanville 4 to 2 and they believe
that it was their ability as baseball
players and not sheer luck that did it
and therefore they are confident of
next Sunday's game. They will line
up the same as last Sunday.
Swanville has an unusually fast
nine this summer and they have
been winning all season. Editor
Rhines of the Swanville News has been
managing the team, which accounts
largely for the fast team they have
there. A good game may be looked
for Sunday.
The following Sunday the" Elks may
play a pickup team from among local
players, to be mustered up—by Peter
Newman.
AN OLD MISSIONARY IS DEAD
Father Tomazin, Priest for 50 Years,
Demised—Not Suicide, Says Fr.
Trobec

ed, is the advice brought to this city
by Rev. John Trobec, who has just re
turned from Chicago. Father Trobec
says that it is the opinion of Chicago
people that Father Tomazin was at his
prayers near the window and perhaps
fell asleep and. tumbled from the win
dow.
Father Tomazin had not been at Chi
cago long before his end came. He was
until recently stationed at the St. An
thony parish, in this diocese. For more

N. P. PUTS EMBARGO ON PERISH
ABLE GOODS
F. G. Ruth, local agent for the
Northern Pacific, has received a no
tice from headquarters of an embargo
on all perishable shipments, owing to
the possibility of the threatened rail
road strike beginning next Monday.
The reason is that the company wishes
to avoid being held for claims for
losses by the shipments being held as
a result of the strike. JThe embargo
includes all livestock.
C. B. Kuhlmann of Minneapolis, for
.mer principal of the local high school,
is in the city lor a few days, to gath

and figures about Morrison county
has been compiled by Messrs. A. H.
Larson of the local high school and
Verne Steward of the Royalton high

APPROPRIATION FOR
MILLE LACS INDIANS
Sum of ,460 Included in the Gen
Deficiency Bill
Washington, Aug. 29.—Ah appro
priation of $689,460.54 is made in the
general deficiency bill reported to the
house today to pay the Mille Lacs In
dian claim, which has been pending
in the courts for about ten years. The
court of claims finally foifnd that this
amount was due the Indians for their
lands located around Mille Lacs lake,
and taken from them by the Federal
government without their consent.
The bill provides that $487,873.94
shall be placed in the United States
treasury to the credit of the Indians
to draw 5 per cent in accordance with
the terms of the Nelson act of 1889.
It was explained at the Indian office,
that the remainder represents the in
terest due the Indians and the amount
also will be retained in the Chippewa
fund. Acting Commiscsioner Merritt
said there would be no disbursement
of any part of the fund, to the Indians.
A special act of congress will be need

Wherever possible three posts on each
side of the turn are marked."

road
well worth
traveling on,'' said Mr. Brunning.
