The becoming modesty with which
Mrs. Parks received the gifts and the
unseltlsh expression of all the ladias
of Columbus, received much favorable
comment from the multitude of sot
dies and ei'-iaens assembled to enjoy
the exercise. Following the program
at tbe theater, the oncers and hon
nred guests werer taken in antoa to
the home of Hiss Burton, the tele
phone manager, where a most delight
ful reception was held in honor of
Mrs. Prince.
A more inspiring picture has not
been seen in New Mexico in many a
year, thsn was beheld in the little
city on tbe border, when Mrs. Prince
fulfilled tbe last act of her noble
crenerosity. Always a talented writ
er and speaker, she fairly excelled
h rself, her address being one of the
Itest ever IjHtened to in this rgion,
r in fact any other region.
At the reception given by Mix
Burton, there were present, the wid
ows of those who lost their lives on
that traffic day, and eaoh told her
own story.
ftoon after tbe . reception, Mrs.
Prince returned to Deming by auto,
where she remained over one day
as the guest of tbe Chamber of Com
merce, tbe whole community desiring
to do her honor.
Monday afternoon, Miss Mary Ma
honey took 'Urn, Prince, with a party
of ladies in her car," using the Graph
ic editor aa "cbaperone," to Camp
Deming, where she had the pleasure
meeting a large number of soldiers,
Saturday afternoon she was giv
on a similiar honor by Mrs. Williams
Rutherford. Tuesday morning, Mra.
Prince left for Fnywood Hot Springs
for a few days rest. Today she will
will go to Silver City, where she
Vill be accorded distinguished honor
nnd tomorrow, tbe ladies of Santa
Rita will give her a reception. On
Monday she will return to her home
in Rajita Fe. .
The address above referred to is
of such a patriotic and inspiring
character, that the Graphic takes
pleasure in publishing the same in
fuU.

What was expected by every sec
tion of the county, haa happen
ed, and in this issue of the Graphic
is Miss Goebel's announcement of her
candidacy to auoceed herself aa the
county superintendent of schools.
There ia not any politics in this
proposition it ia simply a question of
seeking to maintain tbe splendid sys
tem that she has inaugurated, and the
wonderful record of efficiency she
has established.
According to the State Board of
Education, the Luna County school
staisl at the head of the state in
certification, And who is there to say
that this in not due to the untiring
work and judicious management of
the present superintendent f
Miss Goebel is easily one of the
molest superintendents of the entire
state. Hot worth is recognised by
the . New Mexico Educational Asso
ciation and the National Educational
Education,
Evidence of what Miss Goebel has
done can be seen in every district
of Luna County and can be vouched
for by all school officers and pupils
as well. Those whose memories take
them back to the days when Miss
Goebel assumed the duties of this re
sponsible office da not need to be told
how much she haa accomplished and
how far along the road of advance
ment and progress, she has taken the
schools of this county.
