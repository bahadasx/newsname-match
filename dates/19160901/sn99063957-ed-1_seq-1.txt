London, Sept. 1. The Greek

repor.ed abdication. Legation

By Wilbur S. Forrest
(United 1'resa staff correspondent)
London, Sept. 1. A serious revolu
tion has broken out in northern Greece
end according to Salonika reports,
King Constantine has abdicated his
throne.
Official dispatches from Salonikn
this afternoon niinoiinced that the rev
olutionists are in control of one district
in Miacedonia. The government forces
in tiie Macedonian town of Vodena
have joined the revolutionists. The
Greek troops in Salonika were disarmed
and interned by the Anglo-Preuch forc
es after a crowd of revolutionists had
laid siege to the garrison and fighting
bail resulted, -
Athens apparently is cut off from
communication with the outside world
No confirmation of the Salonika re
ports of King ('oustantine's abdication
have come from the Greek capital, but
it is known that a revolutionary party
J'avoring the allies was secretly active.
The 2(1 vear old Crown Prince George
according to Salonika reports, assum
ed the regency following his father's
abdication. An idol of the Greek peo
ple and pro-ally in oympartiy, he is
tinderstood to have the backing of ex
- Premier Vanizelos, leader of the pro
war party.
Wants to Crush Bulgars
The general mobilization of the
Greek army has been ordered. It is
believed here that Greece, influenced
by Bulgaria 's declaration of war on
iRiuuania (today, will ' immediately
range her armies beside those of t'.ie
allies in a great Bnlkoo offensive to
crush the Bulgars.
The Salonikn dispatch predicated
that the revolts were organized by Ma
cedonians, who had vainly urged King
nnstantine to attack the invading Kill
gars. Greek soldiers who had been
sent to their homes when the army
was recently demobilized joined tite
revolutionists in attacking the govern
ment forces.
Bulgaria's declaration of war on Ru
niiniia today paved the way for the
iillipil offensive to crush the Hulgars
which is expected soon to begin. Large
bodies of Russian troops, transported
across Kiimarnia are now threatening
Bulgaria from the north while the nr
ni it s of six allied nations are preparing
to strike from the south.
In both Galicia and Transylvania,
the Russians and Rumnninns linve
scored important successes in tiie last

On Bonrd Hughes" fcueelnl Train
Snlinu, Kan., Sept. 1. Once again Gov
ernor Hughes was "back on wheels"
today, speeding eastward in his cam
paign trip after four rtavs of rest nt
Estes Park. Those four dnys left their
imprint in the governor's sunburned
face, a smoothing out of the wrinkles
of tiredness that had appeared .from
the exertions of the first three weeks of
his campaign, and were reflected in the
republican nominee 's splendid voice. Dr.
N. E. Dittman, who has accompanied
the governor since leaving New York,
examined him today and declared him in
perfect physical condition thereupon
the doctor decided the governor did not
need him any longer and left the party
Today Hughes had a fairly easv pro
grum rear end speeches at Hays, here.
Junction City and Lawrence, and set
speeches at Topeua and Kansas City.
At the last named place, the nominee
will deliver his biggest speech o'f the

Tho republican candidate fonnd
Kansas leaders unanimous in their as
sertions that the Sunflower state would
be overwhelmingly republican. What
was more to his satisfaction, after ex
periences with factional differences
among progressive and regulars in Cnli
fornia and Colorado, he found unity
among the two branches in Kansas.
"The progressives and regulars have
declared a truce, for the present cam
paign only, however," was the way
V illiam Allen bite of Emporia, form
er progressive leader, summed up the
situation, "The two Torees will join
for the present but when this election
is over there will be the same old
division as to state offices."

Will Continue Fight Against
Eight Hour Day
Chicago, Sept. 1. Conduc
tors of five western railroads
have voted not to join a strike
if it is called, it was announced
at the railroad general man
agers' offices thiB afternoon. A
delegation of five men, it was
Baid, nre already on their way
to Washington to notify the
brotherhoods. About 2,000 con
ductors will be represented.
The roads on which the men are
employed arc: Chicago & North
western, Chicngo, Milwaukee &
St. Paul, Chicago Alton,
Pennsylvania and the Burling
ton. The action was Baid by the
managers to have been taken at
a secret meeting last night.
Chicago, Sept. 1. While congress is
preparing to rush legislation which is
believed will avert a railroad strike,
central western railroad executives to
day indicated that they would carrv
the fight against an eight hour law to
tne supreme court of the United States
Officials said such a bill niiuht post
pone a strike, but would not settle the
trouble.
That congressional legislation would
be resisted in the courts was indicated
bv Hale Holileu, president of the Bur
ungton, cniet spokesman for the west
ern executives, and E. P. Ripley, pres
ident of the Santa Fe.
"It is my understanding that the
supreme court of the United States has
held recently in two cases that con
gress has absolutely no power to fix
wages and that is what the Adamson
bill amounts to, according to my under
standing, said iloluen.
hven if congress passes the bill
that doesnt mean the railroads will
agree to it. I don't think they will,'
sum i resiueur. Kipiey. "The unions
might accept the bill and postpone the
strike or call it off, but that will not
settle the matter.
"It would be up to the governmen
to sue the railroads to compel the pnv-
men of increase in wages, Then, of
course, it would lie a matter for the
courts.
i can I see where action by con
gress on this basis would settle th
controversy. On the contrary, 1 dou'
think it would," Ripley concluded.
Mollification of embargoes bv west
ern roads was looked for today. The
announcement by the Santa Fe that
perishable freight, excepting livestock,
would be accepted after Monday at
the owners risk, was taken to mean
that it looked for a postponement of
the strike.
Other trunk lines with headquarters
in Chicago have not yet issued similar
orders, but freight officials aro ex
pecting them.
' Barbed Wire at Terminals
San Francisco, Sept. 1. Preparations
for the threatened railroad strike con
tinued today despite the apparent
change for the better brought about
by the introducion of legislation to
avert trouble.
Today the employes of the Southern
Pacific and Santa Fe are receiving
final friendly warnings from the com
panies, reminding them that any man
striking forfeits his rights to pension
ami his seniority rights. In addition,
the company is posting notices in all
waiting rooms, ticket -offices audi
freight depots, warning passengers andj
shippers that tickets will be Bold, orj
shipments received only when the des
tination can be rcaciied by tomorrow
night. High board fences, with barbed
wire on top, have been built around the
terminal yards of the Southern Pacific,
Western Pacific, Santa Fe and North-
western Pacific.
Railroads report today that moreof
their employes have definitely decided
to remain with the company. With
these and a reserve force of pensioned
employes they expect to operate sev-
eral trains daily. Even the Southern
Pacific transbay ferry service will
probably continue in case of a strike,
for arrangements were made wiiereby
the Southern Pacific ferryboats, which
are not affected bv the strike, will op

Jike Hughes, He Attacked
Wilson for Weak Course
with Mexico
New York, Sept. 1. William R. Will-
cox, chairman of tne republican na
tional committee, believes that Colonel
Roosevelt's first speech in behalf of
Charles E. Hughes at Lewiston, Maine,
last night not only is of great value to
the republican enncidate. but is "note
worthy contribution to the history of
the nation."
Plunging into the Maine campaign.
the colonel assailed rue Wilson admin
istration for its Ivlexican. policV. flay
ed hyphens and held President Wilson
responsible for "an evil revival of
non-American and anti-American divis
ion along political-racial lines."
Tins is due primarily, the colonel
said, "to the fact that President Wil
son has lacked the courage and the vis
ion to lead this nation in the path of
man duty, and by this lack of attirm
ative leadership has loosened the moral
libre of our people, weakened our na
tional spirit and has encouraged the
upgrowth within our borders ot separa
tism along the lines of racial origin."
The colonel declared the citizen who
seeks to shape American policy in the
interest of the country from which be
or his ancestors came, has no moral
right to American citizenship.
In a statement left at republican
headquarters before his departure for
Indianapolis and given out today, bus
ed on the advance copy of Roosevelt's
speech, Chairman nHlcox commented
at length on the colonel's denunciation
of the administration's Mexican poll
cy.
Was Too Vacillating
"We have all known," he declnred,
" that President Wilson constantly
changed his mind on the subject of per
mitting the sending of arms and am
munition into Mexico, but no one be
fore has presented the evidence of his
vaccilatiou in ns concise und forceful
form as Colonel Roosevelt."
In recognizing Carrnnzn, Colonel
Roosevelt declured President Wilson
not only "kissed the hand that slap
ped whim in the face but kissed that
hand when it was red with the blood
of American men, women mid chil
dren." "Also to whom, other than Colonel
Roosevelt, would it have occurred to
remark that it was 'unjust to Pontius
Pilate' to liken the neutrality of Pres
ident Wilson to that of the Roman pro
curator," Willcox declared.
The national committeeman called
attention to Roosevelt's reference to
what he termed American intervention
in Haiti and the "bloody pence" in
Mexico.
"Mr. Roosevelt's speech was pure
and unadulterated Americanism," Will
cox declared "and in supporting Mr.
Hughes, every one must realize that
he is wholly unselfish, that he has
nothing to gain for himself and is ac
tuated solely by motives or patriot
ism. ' '
Will Not Affect Result.

Dondon, Sept. 1. Using the famous
Gcrinau "nut cracker" tactics, the Ru
manians nre pressing 'forward rapidly
on both wings, squeezing the Austrinns
out of all southeastern Transylvanin.
The Austrians, caught in the ceuter
and in danger of being crushed by the
jaws of tho "nut cracker," already
have abandoned more than 400 square
miles of Transylvaiiian territory to the
invaders. At least a dozen towns and
villages have been captured by the Ru
mnninns since war was declared Sun
day night. So rapidly are the AuBtrians
retreating on the center that there has
been little heavy fighting and but fewl
prisoners hnve been taken.
The Rumanian right wing, linked up
with the Russians near the Bukowina
frontier, is advancing on the famous
old Hungarian city of Bistritz, 30 miles
from the Rumanian frontier. A Central
News dispatch from The .Hague today
said that, the Austrians are preparing to
evneuate Bistritz. .
Heavy fighting continues alone the
mountain front lending southward from
Bukowina.
Along the southern bonier of Transyl
vania, the Austrians are attempting to
make a stand In the mountain passes.
The Berlin Tngeblatt's correspondent at
the .Austrian front, admitting the Bur
render of Kronzstadt and other towns
to the Rumanians, indicated that the
Austrians will fight stubbornly to hold
Hermannatadt, former cnpitul of Tran
sylvania, and the Red Tower pnss, the
mountain gatewav approaching Her
mannstndt. Should the Rumanians burst
through this pass In large force, they
might cut off and capture the Aus
trians retreating from southeastern
Trnnsylvania.
Forty-five miles further west, how
ever, the Rumnninns have pierced to
Vall-.an Pass, it is ndmitted at Vien
na, and hnve marched 10 miles north

town of Petrosenvi.

shortly after noon toiluy when the
house adopted a special rule under
which nt 4: -HI this afternoon it is pro
posed to pass the A dura sou eight hour
bill.
Tho rule was not adopted without
objection, but the democratic majority
held the debate to one hour. The house

gan almost simultaneously with intro
duction into the senate of the similar
sennte interstate commerce commit
tee's bill for an eight hour law. This
had been perfected during a recess
granted to permit a republican confer
ence. Republican Representatives Lenroot
and Cooper, Wisconsin, were heartily
cheered by the democrats when they
announced they would vote not only
for the special rule, but for the Adam
son bill.

by Representative Clark of
Florida, to include in the bill
the 1,000,000 employes not af

After a ' sharp fight the
house this afternoon decided to
exempt from the . Adamson
eight hour bill's provisions elec
tric interurban railways and
independent railroads of less
than 100 miles except terminal
companies.
Washington, Sept. 1. After feverish
haste in its efforts to thwart a Railroad
strike, the house late this afternoon
passed the Adamson eigth honr law for
train employes, by a vote or za ro ot.
This measure, acceptable to the broth
erbnods as a preventative of the threat
ened Btrike, proposes an eight hour day
for train employes with it) nours pay,
ncudinir a six to eight months investiga
tion by a commission, creuted under the
act.
Washington, Sept. 1. The house plan
was to limit debate by special rule to
about two hours and to vote on the
Adamson bill at 4 p. m.
Shortly after 10 oclock the senate
recessed until 1 o'clock. The action
was taken, it was said, in order to Bound
the extent of the republican opposi
tion that might develop on the strike
bill. With the house bill passed along
to the senate, leaders of the latter body
said they would make every effort to
make the two bills conform in the chief
terms so as to eliminate necessity for
more than formnl action, if any, by the
house and sennte committees.
Republican Scnato Leader Gallinger
said:
"There will be no obstructive tactics.
Tho bill probably will be passed by to
morrow night."
New-lands introduced the senate bill

brought this case here. There is no
more law abiding body of men in the
world than members of the four great
brotherhoods."
Lenroot joined Cooper in declaring
President Wilson is "responsible for
the present crisis."
''The president told us Tuesday Us
crisis had been threatening tne na
tlon's life for a year. Why did not
he, and did not you democrats do
something before this, if he 'and you
knew of the impending calamity t No
one believes this is really an eight
hour law. It is merely legislating the
employes an increase in pay."
''Shotgun procedure" is what Rep-
representative Uennett called the ac
tion of the brotherhood leaders in say
ing only an eight hour law cqn prevent
the strike Monday.
"1 don't believe this bill will pre
vent the strike. No one competent to

(United Press stuff correspondent.)
Washington, Sept. 1. If settlement
of the railroad controversy isn't one
of the things President Wilson will
have to talk about at his notification
party iu Long Branch tomorrow, it
won 't be because he didn 't- work hard
at it today.
The president went to the oftice ot
Chairman Newlnnds of the senate inter
state commerce committee and went
over with the latter the "strike preven
tion" bill which Newlands planned to
iutroduce today. After approving this,
he went to his rooms off the senata
chamber.
The president remained there less
than -half an hour and conferred with
Senator Kern. Apparently satisfied
with the outlook, he left at 10:10 for
the White House.
Departure for Long Branch at 3
o'clock loomed ahead all day aud them
was always the chance of a tangle that
would muke all his peace efforts use
less. The president hopes to find an eight
hour duy bill ready for hi signature
when he gets back to Washington Sun
day. He will have the signature ready.
Although the program agreed on by
house and senate leaden to the joint
sessions of . congress Tuesday, he indi
cated today a willingness to accept the
emergency legislation which the rail- .
road workers say will avert a strike and
which many of the railroad heads
though not all by any means say is not
objectionable to them.
There was some hope even that tho
bill might be passed by noon tomorrow
and delivered to the president by spe
cial messenger for his signature in
Long Branch tomorrow night, so that it
would actually be law before midnight
Saturday.
