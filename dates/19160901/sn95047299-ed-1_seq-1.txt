Explains Purchase of Prop
ertyWill Oust "Billy1'
Parker.
The Palatka News is in receipt of
the following communication from Mr.
George White of Hackensack, N. J.,
who holds deed to Edgewater Grove
from Mrs. Martha II. Rogers. The
communication will have an interest
to all readers owing to the fact that
"Billy" Parker, the leader of the
"Guardians of Liberty," claims that
he also has purchased the property
and has been in possession for some
time. This is Mr. White's letter:
551) Main St., Hackensack, N. J.
August 28, 1916.
Editor Palatka News,
Palatka, Fla.
Jriave received copy of News of Aug.
25, no doubt in response to my request
ior being put on list. Expect to be in
Palatka before long, and will call and
pay you.
An item in "City Happenings" in
terests me. It would appear that
some Jacksonville and other newspa
per mention has been given to the
presence at Edgewater Grove of peo
ple by the name of Parker, and to
some difficulty regarding their "pos
session" of that property. It may be
worth while, therefore, for me to give
some facts relating thereto. I have
not seen any newspaper mention any
where of the matter, and know noth
ig deiiite as to the kind of founda
tion which the Parker claim has or is
alleged to have.
The grove was sold to Martha H.
Rodgers, of Brooklyn, N. Y., by Dr.
Rix. A deed was given and recorded.
The grove was visited by Mr. Rodgers
and he left it in charge and possession
of Spencer Vreeland, who has lived
there as a tenant for some years. In
addition Calvin Boyd, a laborer, was
left there as tenant, pending an ar
rangement for him to be employed
regularly. I looked the place over in
May last, and saw both Vreeland and
Boyd there. I told Boyd to stay
right there, and if I arranged for the
property to be purchased and to live
there he could stay ngnc aiong wiui
me. The property was duly purchas
ed, and a deed given and recorded,
about the end of July. Thereupon
I immediately notified Boyd to com
mence to work until I could get there.
Evidently the grove has never been
out of the possession of either Mrs.
Rodgers or the new owner, and it is
,!,., if tr. cpp where it can be claim
ed that the Parkers have ever been I
put in possession. I
It coming to my knowledge that
the Parker's have been on the place i
I communicated with Mrs. Rodgers j
and was assured tnai sne kmcvv
ing of them and had never authorized
in anv wav their being there either
temporarily or otherwise. Later, sh?
said she had received a communica
tion from an attorney at Jacksonville
to the effect that the Parkers had
paid one Becks an installment on a
purchase price for the grove, and had
been sent to the grove by Becks. To
this Mrs. Rodgers claims she replied

Albert Muller an employe of the
Florida Woodenware company of this
city and whose home is in the Fran
cis precinct near Wigg's Lake, was
shot and killed while on his way home
from work Wednesday evening about
5:30.
As near as can be estimated, Mrs.
Muller was killed at her home between
two at d three o'clock the same after
noon. At present no eye witnesses
can testify to the killing of Mrs. Mul
ler by the son, but circumstancial ev
idence, together with the admissions
of her demented son, point conclu
sively to the same weapon in the
hands of this maniac.
J. M. Sanders of Francis saw John
Muller shoot his father. Mr. San
ders was on his way home from work
and passed the old man in the Heights
near to where the road branches off
to go to the Crill residence. Mr.
Sanders says the old man acted as if
he was looking for some one; that he
walked slowly and frequently turned
to look back. When Mr. Sanders had
gone some 300 yards he heard the
sound of a gun, but said he didn't
think much about it that someone
might be hunting but he turned and
looked back down the road to see Al
bert Muller on the ground with his
son standing over him shooting into
the prostrate form. He waited a mo
ment in alarm, then was joined by a
negro named Gold Vance, and they
both saw the murderer take hold of
the prostrate man's hand and drag
him some 50 or 60 yards to the north
of the road and dump him into a
hole; then the man took a spade and
shoveled the earth over him. When
the murderer had shoveled the earth
into the grave he left, going in a
northwest direction away from the
road.
Mr. Sanders and Gold Vance then
went to the home of R. C. Woolwine
and telephoned the sheriff's office. In
a short time Deputy Sheriff Minton
arrived and all went to the grave.
The hole was not filled up, only about
a foot of earth being over the dead
man. They lifted him out and car
ried the corpse to this city where it
was turned over to Undertakers
Mooney & Davis.
That John Muller had deliberately
planned this murder there can be no
doubt. He dug the grave the day be
fore the tragedy, and on Wednesday
night lay in wait for his father while
on his way home. The place in the
road where this tragedy occurred was
some 400 or 500 yards beyond the
Crill residence and on the clay road.
Later in the evening Deputy Sher
iff Minton went to the Muller home.
All was peaceful there. The place
was in order and the supper table
was laid. But Mrs. Muller or the son
were n ot about. They searched tha
crounds and about 300 feet from the
house Chief of Police Livingston
came upon what looked like a re
cently made grave. They dug into it
and found the body of Mrs. Muller.
She also had been shot several times,
mid had evidently been dead several
hours. Tracks showed where a wheel
barrow had been used to carry her
lifeless body from the house to the
grave.
Both graves were opened and the
bodies taken out in the presence of
, . , -r .i" Tl
nines empane'ea oy justice joim r,.
Marshall, and these juries of inquest
then adjourned to the following day.
On Thursday morning the inquest
into the death'of Albert Muller was
concluded and the jury held the son
for first degree murder. In the after
noon the inquest into the death of
Mrs. Muller was held and the same
verdict reached.
About ten o'clock that night while
coming down Lemon street Clarence
Morwin saw young Muller and pointed
him out to Deputy Minton. He was
carrying a gun. Minton got out of
the car and rushed him, catching him
bv the arms. The gun was cocked
ready for action. The murderer was
hastened to the iail. The rifle was a
:?J calibre Winchester repeater, and
had some eieht cartridges in it at the
time of capture.
Albert Muller and wife and their
son came to this country some eight
or nine years ago from Germany.
They first settled in Detroit, Michigan.
.Abont four or five years ago he came
to Florida attracted by the offers of
the old New South Farms & Homes
Co. Later he purchased a small
place at Wigg's Lake.
He was a ouiet. unassuming and
hard working man, and his wife was j
a peaceful, home-loving wife and :
mother. Their son. John, has been
erratic for some time. The mother
intended him for the ministry of the
Baptist faith, but after an effort at
theological study it was determined
that the hoy was not adapted to it.
lie failed to comprehend his studies.
But he was religious and studious.
He has been seen walking down the
middle of the streets of this city
reading a book.
Yesterday morning during the in
ouest he was brought from the jail
to the court house. He wore a heavy
chinchilla overcoat with velvet colar,
light trousers and heavy shoes. He
was batless. He was given a seat
facing the jury and soon after he be
gan to mumble. He wanted to talk,
but Judge Marshall asked him to
keep still and he obeyed. He had
prepared his statement as he called
it and this was given to Judge Mar
shall by Deputy Minton. The State
ment tollows:
"The Court of Universe.
"It is not permissible and custom
to arrest and emerge a general and
military commander who has charge
of the bloodiest war in the world. If
1 did not pass the penitentiary, but
would take another route to sit at the
court house and the benches of it,
you would respect my person, not for
the sake of history but for reasons
you evidence, you cannot excuse the
arrest and easing of my soul and
body. There is sufficient evidence
that navies neglect to fulfill their du
ty at this critical time or the redemp
tion can be paid to them before God,
except the price of blood that has
brought the price of national freedom.
On better carelessness about myself.
Let me arrive to my inherited prop
erty in this world, where I will ex
pect my pay and my doctor, for I say
this is not the only mortification. I
am directed to execute which some
how publicly happened to be execut
ed irritate my same ideas and imper
fect weapons. I cannot account for
the terrible disfigurment of my belov
ed parents, for it is partiallly due to
improper weapons and their influence.
You solemnly knew and expected.
Conforming to eye witnesses the
death of- my father the matter has
arrived to this same state of situa
tion, whether it is found in the city
or throughout the United States.
The first prize you will pay me as a
subject of your government and na
tion is my release and banished ex
istence at my residence in Florida, to
await more price upon the interna
tional law and return my funds, ex
cepting a $10 gun, for such reason
I had to life of my dear and faithful
parents, who are now resting in their
eternal silence until awakened in in
surmoutabb difficulties of distress,
etc., etc."
There is more of this same sort,
with frequent reference to his mili
tary standing in which he refers to
having added another murder to the
world war.
The young man is undoubtedly
crazy. He shows it in looks, in ac
tions and conversation. His hobby
in the world war. While seated fac
ing the jury he frequently spoke,
without regard to the proceedings.
At one time he said: "I did not thinK
of killing my parents until two days
before ." "You better not talk,"
cautioned Judge Marshall, and he
again subsided.
But the horror of it all lies in the
fact that he was the son of a doting
mother who excused him and who
believed he was destined for a useful
life..
This mother, together with the
lather, who was more or less skepti
cal concerning his son's future life of
usefulness, but who had nevertheless
to the best of his ability performed
a father's part in providing a home
and comforts and an education to
ivive the bov a start in the world
were only to be murdered by that
sniy son, a maniac.
After shooting and burying his
father, John wandered about the coun
try in the dark. At one time he ap
proached the home and little store
of Mr. Richardson where he bought
a can of beans and a pineapple, and
where he asked Mr. Richardson:
"Have you heard any talk around
here?" At that time Mr. Richard
son hadn't heard of the murder.
The murderer purchased the gun
used for the double tragedy during
the day at one of the down town
stores.
CATTS HOLDS GRAND
RALLY TUESDAY NfGHT
At Court House Standing
Room Only Usual
Diatribe.
At the Baptist Church.
Rev. Dr. R. L. Bonsteel, the new
pastor of the First Baptist church,
entered upon his pastorate today, and
next Sunday will officiate as pastor
for the first time. He will preach
at both the morning and evening
hours 11 a. m. and 7:30 p. m. and
the officials of the church extend a
most cordial invitation to the people
to come out and hear the new pastor.
Dr. and Mrs. I'onsteel have rented
the second story fiat in the residence
of Hon. A. Usina, at the corner of
North Third and Reid streets.
The News has no hesitancy in say
ing that it believes the people of Pa
latka are going to take kindly to the
new pastor and that he will prove a
live wire for the moral and spiritual
betterment of the city. When you
chance to meet the gentleman on the
street, make yourself known; you'll
meet a real human being whom you
are bound to like.
I have some inquiries for improved
farms; also for improved or unim
proved land on or near the St. Johns
River. If you have something of
the kind for sale, list it with me, it
may be just what the other fellow
wants, t. J. KNIGHT, N-4th St.
Th Way of Prices.
The news of pr. ?''vrnce In prices
travels much far;,- s r-'tV.-rtlon
which may fo'b ,., .
Rev. Sidney J. Catts, candidate tor
govrmor of oiida. spoke at the
.'juit house, in this city last Tuesday
nigiit to an iw c'jtnce which fill -a every
available seat. Others stood uitside
tne entrance c'oors peering throign.
There were nearly 300 people present,
many Demg laaies.
The meeting had been announced for
several days and was well known. Of
course many of those present were
avowed Catts men, while others were
prompted to attend through curiosity
and to see and hear the man who is
just now attracting public attention.
It would be hard to tell just the pro
portion, but The News will be liberal
and credit two-thirds of those present
to the former list.
Mr. Catts himself tried to find out
how the crowd stood, but failed; he
wanted those who were for him in the
primary and who intended to support
him in the general election to hold up
their hands. Very many hands went
up; then he wanted those who intend
ed to support Knott in the general
election to stand up. Of course but
few stood. People will not be able to
make up their minds whom they are
going to support in the general elec
tionat least DEMOCRATS are not
until the Supreme Court of the
State, after the evidence is all in, has
decided TO WHOM THE DEMO
CRATIC VOTERS GAVE THE NOM
INATION. If it is given to Catts,
they will support Catts; if to Knott,
then they (the democrats) will sup
por Knott.
But the meeting.
Rev. S. Grnrlv nf the Pnlnflrp Motli.
odist church acted as chairman of the
meeting. He first introduced Rev.
Mr. Blizzarde of Leesburg, who
vouched for Mr. Catts, and who testi
fied to the esteem in which he is held
by the people among whom he lived
in Alabama.
Then came the orator of the even
ing. The editor of The News was
not present and therefore cannot give
an outline of the address except
through second hand. Our repre
sentative was not a reporter, but he
vouches for the statement that Mr.
Catts' address abounded in charges of
fran.l that, fun nnf bp ciianinfl
was notably a harrangue made up of
recKiess political statements calculat
ed to plav UDOn the Dreiudiees of t.h?
people.
One quotation from the morning
Daner's renort of the address is o-i von
as an example.
"Touching upon the argument that
the courts were supreme, he denied
this, pointing out that the courts'
power was by the will of the people
ana tnat it is tney, tne sovereign peo
ple of Florida, who are the masters
Suppose we grant that this is in a
measure true; it does not mean that
the mob may be masters; it means
th.'lt. thp pennlo bv pnncf ilnHrtnnl
derly proceedure, speaking through an
election, may change the personnel of
the court; it does not mean that the
mob, styling itself the people, is to be
the master and defy the edict of the
courts, as Mr. Catts says he will do.
But what is the use; no one can re
view i."-. address he did not hear. The
News speaks of this one paragraph
taken from a contemporary publica
tion's report of the meeting, and of
the appeal for an expression as to
":he sentiment of the voters of the
meeting by a show of hands, because
they seem to be well authenticated
facts.
The Palatka News will support Sid
ney J. Catts only in the event he i9
declared by the Supreme Court of
Florida to be the democratic nominee.
It is willing to go on record now that
it believes in the integrity of the
-ourts; it has every reason for disbe
lieving in the integrity of Mr. Catts.
Mr. Cattr,' speech was generously
applauded at many points.
