The State of Thursday makes an
J appeal to partisanship and draws tiie
lines, or tries to do so, in the governor's
race. That will cut both ways.
! Some time back that sort of thing was
| frowned upon by The State and we
j i-re sorry to see the effort made to stir
up partisianship and draw factional
lines. It "will scarcely work at this
late hour.
i It would be very remarkable if
! I
i Blease should not win with the iarge

It has been difficult to get the re- }
turns for some reason. The official re- j

Manning 1272. The dai ly papers 05 j
rather The State and News and j

listing figures giving -Manning a lead
in Newberry county. This makes a
tofcil in tliis race of 3,242 of which
1,673 would be a majority So Bl^e
lacks only 46 votes of a majority of
all the candidates for governor in
