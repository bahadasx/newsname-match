THE GREAT MASONIC CON
CLAVE.
The Largest Gathering of Race Lead
ers.
Last week Chicago, 111., witnessed
one of the largest and most enthusi
astic Masonic meetings ever held by
the Negro race. It was conceded to
be the largest and most intelligent
body of secret society men and women
ever held in Chicago and the most rep
resentative ever held by the Negro
race in the world. It was a meeting
where all of the branches of Masonry
from the first to the 33rd degree met
and all the branches of the women's
department met. It was the first
time in the history that all branches
of this, the greatest fraternal society
in the world, met. There were fully
5,000 visitors in Chicago. Every state
in theunion was represented and sev
eral foreign countries present. In
that branch known as the Internation
al Conference of Grand Masters, P. G.
M.'s and Grand Secretaries, this was
the most important of all rae branch
es, as it was the foundation of the
other branches. This was the branch
that your humble servant presided at
here. ,We had twenty-one states rep
resented by either grand masters or
grand secretaries, a total of thirty
two members of this conference. The
most enthusiasm was aroused when
the grand master of Ohio, Cora
Adams, presented P. G. M. Wm. Boyd,
th'e riestor of the round "table and vet
eran Masonic law exponent, who had
served our beloved order for sixty-five
years, and then W. L. Harrison of
Pennsylvania presented their nestor,
Wm. Miller, who has served the order
fifty-one years, and he is the present
grand secretary. Then Grand Master
S. Joe Brown presented Iowa's oldest
member, Austin A. Bland, who for
fifty years last April has been in the
active work of the order. Much work
was done in regard to uniformity of
all Masonic work, especially the rit
ualistic work. The committee on uni
formity recommended the adoption of
the ritual just issued by Ohio. The
recommendation was passed unani
mously. In the International Su
preme Grand Chapter of O. E. S. there
were many states represented by both
present and past grand matrons and
patrons. They held a fine meeting
and so did the Daughters of Isis, also
the Court of Heroines of Jericho.
Then the Royal Arch Masons and the
commandery meetings were largely
attended and very instructive. The
Imperial Council A. E. A. O. Nobles
of Mystic Shrine held the largest at
tended and most enthusiastic meeting
in its history and much business was
done. Their parade Monday evening
was the finest and longest ever held.
Their contest drill at the Eighth retri
ntal armory was simply grand.
New York won first prize and at.
Louis second. The Knight Templars
parade Thursday afternoon was two
miles long. Several bands and fully
3,000 sir knights in line. The ath
letics were good at the White Sox ball
park. In the evening the conclave
closed with a drill and dance. The
Emmanual commandery of Kansas
City won first prize. Fully 1,000 were
dancing at the Seventh regimental
hall
EDITOR'S OBSERVATIONS.
On our visit to Chicago last week
we omitted to run the regular obser
vations, therefore we begin in Minne
apolis, Minn., which was the last reg
ular stop. Here we find one of the
most beautiful cities in the United
States, in fact the prettiest' city I

streets and well kept, beautiful homeg
and magnificent business buildings,
all bespeaking an air of prosperity.
This town has about "4,000 colored
people and many are doing well. The
Twin City Star is still being published
here by Mr. Charles Sumner Smith.
We hope the Star will continue to
shine. Mrs. J. L. Neal, one of the
oldest settlers of this town, still lives
in her beautiful home at 1823 South
Fifth street. She served dinner to
the editor on Sunday. We enjoyed
the hospitality She has two sons.
One is employed as a clerk'and the
other as a stenographer in an office
here. They are doing well. Mr. Jones
and Mr. Bell own a first class barber
shop and are having a large trade.
