CONSIDERABLE ACTIVITY
AT CONSOLIDATED NEV
ADA UTAH PROPERTIES
Work at the Consolidated Nevada
Utah properties has gone on success
fully during the past week. Instal
lation of additional capacity in the
flotation department of the mill has
proved to be very beneficial, higher
extraction being obtained at the pres
ent time than at any other time since
the mill begun to operate. The
grade of material being fed to the
mill is substantially higher than the
calculated heads assay, and the ton
nage has been 10 to 20. per cent
greater than specified when the mill
was designed. Almost no running
time has been lost.
In the mine the development on
the 1400 level south of the dike is
very interesting. A water course
and a quartz vein having been en
countered. The mine crew has been
substantially increased within the
.past ten days.
The Pioche Pacific railway has
been extremely busy keeping the
mill supplied with ore, and taking
the concentrates away from it. There
has also been a large coal business.
The Jack r Rabbit division has been
busy almost every day bringing in
the Urge tonnage from the Bristol
mine.
New concrete piers are being plac
ed under the ore transfer bins at the
depot.
GROOME MINE SHIPS 30
CARS ORE TO SMELTER
According to reports given out in
Salt Lake on the Groome district,
100 miles southwest from Pioche,
Utah people have picked up another
valuable property. The Groome has
shipped 30 cars under the new man
agement. The haul is 55 miles to
the Salt Lake Route. The richer ore
carries up to 60 per cent galena and
20 ounces silver. It is of such a
character that there are practically
no smelter charges. One car had a
smelter charge of only 1 cent a ton,
while others ranged from that on up
to 39 cents a ton. As an instance to
show how the rise in price of metals
affects the mines, the Groome ship
ped out a carload of average grade
when metals were low and It brought
$4 7 a ton. Recently another car of
precisely the same grade brought the
company $78 a ton, or nearly double.
The formation of the Groome dis
trict is principally limestone and
shale. Some of the veins are 40 feet
wide, with lead sprinkled all through
them. In places they are reported 70
. feet wide. Deseret News.
PIOCHE BRISTOL GETS
SETTLEMENT OX CAR
Officers of the Pioche Bristol prop
erty in the Bristol district, fourteen
miles from Pioche, yesterday receiv
ed settlement on the first car of ore
shipped from the property since it
was incorporated and taken over by
Suit Lake men. The car contained
about thirty-six tons, for which the
net settlement at the smelter .after
all costs except mining, was approxi
mately $315 or $12.87 a tou net. The
ar, it is declared, contained conbii'
erable low grade rock, which was
necessary in cleaning up to get out
the shipment. .
The second car is on the road and
will be settled for in the next few
days. In the meantime it is declared
that there are several cars, of ore
broken down in the mine which the
management will ship as soon as pos
sible. It is the intention to shortly
send out a car a week as the devel
opment has reached a point where
this can be done regularly.
The recent washout at Pioche has
delayed things considerably. It took
out about half a mile of the Jack
Rabbit road, which had to be repair
ed before supplies could be brought
into Bristol. Consequently there has
been considerable delay in the work
being carried on.
H. L. Parker, formerly at the Utah
Apex in Bingham, is superintendent
of the property and has five men
working. The chief work now being
carried on is the sinking of a shaft,
from the 70,-foot level to the 110
level this lias been in a low grade
ore, which If sorted would make a
shipping product. The ore carries
considerable iron and manganese,
which has good value as a flux at the
smelter. Besides, it carries consider-

Railways of United States
Prepare for
Railroads of the nation in view of
the threatened railroad strike, rush
ed preparations Wednesday to en
force an embargo on perishable
freight. Shipments of livestock and
perishables were refused by some
roads Wednesday; others issued
warnings that perishable freight,
which cannot reach its destination
by September 2, will not be accepted.
From Chicago, the railroad center
of the country, orders were given to
ticket agents to inform passengers
that unless they reach their destina
tion by Sunday night they would be
subjected to "perplexing delays."
Big manufacturers and business
houses swamped telegraph companies
with messages urging that their ship
ments be rushed at once. Many pf
them authorized sending their or
ders by express
Associated Press dispatches from
all parts of the country indicated
that within 4 8 hours, unless a delay
in the strike is ordered, embargo or
ders will be effective on practically
every railroad in the country.
Harris Weinstock, state market di
rector of California, said that a strike
of anv duration meant ruin to thous
ands of fruitgrowers. A Sacramento
dispatch stated that picking fruit in
that rich district had virtually ceas
ed.
Commercial and industrial organ
izations throughout the country were
reported "hoping for the best and
preparing for the worst."
Railroad men honed that man v
members of the brotherhoods would
not obey the strike order. In fact,
it was rumored that little if anv
pressure would be brought to bear
on the older generation of engineers
and conductors whose seniority has
placed them in well-paid positions,
many of them with pensioned leisure
not far away.
PLAN FOR WORK UNDER
.Secretary Houston has just an
nounced the plan to be pursued in
spending the ten million dollars ap-'
propriated by the Federal Aid Road
Act for the construction and main
tenance of roads and trails within or
partly within National Forests, and
has tentatively allotted among the
various National Forest states the
million dollars which is expendable
this fiscal year.
The tentative allotments to the
principal National Forest states are
as follows: Alaska, $46,280; Ari
zona $39,795; Arkansas $11,294;
California $140,763; Colorado $62,
335; Idaho $108,010; Montana $89,
901; Nevada $19,195; New Mexico
$12,622; Oregon $127,794; South
Dakota $S,115; Utah $40,982; Wash
ington $91,739; Wyoming '$40,566.
In addition, a total $9,552 has been
tentatively assigned to Florida,
Michigan, Minnnesota, Nebraska,
North Dakota, and Oklahoma, while
the eastern states Maine, New
Hampshire, Virginia, West Virginia,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Ten
nessee, and Georgia in which the
government is purchasing lands for
National Forsts, have been allotted
$21,057.
"In general," said Secretary Hous
ton, "the states and counties will be
required to furnish cooperation in an
amount at least equal to 50 per cent
of the estimated cost of the surveys
and construction. However, upon a
satisfactory showing by the applicant
state of county that such proportion
of cooperation is inequitable, it may
be altered and the ration of cooper
ation fixed upon a basis equitable to
both the state or county and the
United States."
The method followed in appor
tioning the money was explained by
Secretary Houston as follows: Ten
per cent of the amount available each
year will be withheld as a contingent
sfund. One-half of the remainder
will be allotted to the states in
amounts which will be based on the
area of the National Forest lands in
Complete Tieup
The Erie appealed directly to its
41,000 employees not to strike.
The Santa Fe made a similar ap
peal weeks ago wheu the strike vote
was being taken.
The Pennsylvania road took a poll
of its employees and reported that 90
per cent of them expressed willing
ness to take the places of strikers.
Other roads have made similar in
vestigations in most cases and it is
said that more than one high official,
arisen from, the ranks, is prepared to
enter the cab of an engine to move
necessary freight and passengers.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 The
senate interstate commerce commit
tee adopted a resolution today pro
viding for a hearing on proposed
railrcad legislation in the pending
crisis, beginning Thursday at 9 a. m.
Railroad officials, brotherhood offi
cers and representatives of shippers
were invited to appear.
Each side will be given three hours
in which to discuss its views of leg
islation proposed by President Wil
son to prevent the threatened strike
and to provide for operation of trains
in the event of a strike.
The committee has under consid
eration tentative drafts of three bills.
One covers the proposed eight-hour
day and creates a wage commission
of three members, two to be recom
mended respectively by the railroads
and the brotherhood which shall
observe the administrative and finan
cial effects of the institution of the
eight-hour day.
Another amends the Newlands act
to make ..arbitration; more, effective
along the line of Canadian principles.
The third provides for government
operation of railroads for military
nesessity.
"No power on earth except a sat
isfactory settlement now can prevent
a strike," said W. G. Lee, president
of the trainmen.

each state. The other half will be
apportioned .on a basis of estimated
value of timber and forage resources
which the forests contain. Amounts
apportioned but unexpended within
three years, and any balance of the
contingent fund which remains unap
portioned at the end of each year,
will be reapportioned on the same
basis as the priginal allotments.
The two groups of states to which
lump sums are allotted are, it was
explained, to be considered as single
units of apportionment. Apportion
ments now to be made are for the
current fiscal year only. Thereafter
new apportionments will be made,
giving consideration to the number
and character of applications made
by the state and county officials for
expenditures an specific projects.
These applications must be' filed with
th District Foresters in the seven
National Forest Districts on or before
January 1 of each year, for the fiscal
year beginning the following July 1.
The determination of the projects
upon which funds will be expended
during the current fiscal year will be
made on the basis of applications
which must be filed with the District
Foresters on or before October 1,
1916., Each application must con
tain a statement of the public needs
to be served by -the proposed road
land the manner and extent to which
it would aid in the development of
resources upon which communities
within or adjacent to the National
Forests are dependent, and must also
show the general location of the pro
posed road and its estimated cost
As already stated, in general states
and counties must be prepared to
furnish cooperation equal to at least
50 per cent of the estimated cost of
surveys and construction. This co
operation may be in the form of
money, labor and materials, or the
construction of roads. Where other
factors are equal, the approval of a
project may be determined upon the
relative amount of cooperation offer
ed. Many applications have, it is
stated, already been received for ex
penditures upon specific projects.

LARGEST POTATO CHOP IN
NEVADA'S HISTORY PREDICTED
As ti the effect of the weather on
crops, Mrs. Edward C. Paxton, field
agent of the lirc ui ;.f crop estimates
for Nevada, sa.n: "Although ex
tremely dry, the month of July
saw a very normal development
of crops in Nevada. The lower
ranges have suffered severely from
the continued drought and live stock
dependent on such ranges are report
ed thin. Where the first crop of al
falfa, injured by the frost, was cut
early, a second crop above normal
was harvested, and a third cut is
promised. Irrigation water for all
crops has been ample, and Nevada
bids fair to break all previous rec
ords for total production of small
grains. Preliminary estimates indi
cate a winter wheat yield of 45 bush
els per acre; somewhat less than last
year's yield, but well up to the av
erage of recent years. Wild hay in
Elko county is reported light, due to
the severely cold weather of late
spring. Present conditions indicate
the largest potato crop in Nevada
history. Fruit is almost a failure.

ket. The crop is large and excellent

There is no better index to a town

to go by, and is considered so by
sagacious men, than a photograph;
it is the enterprise of the inhabitants
and not the size of the buildings that
makes the town. You may pick up

FEDERAL FARM LOAN
BOARD MEETS IN RENO
The Federal Farm Loan Board is
planning to hold a hearing in Reno,
on September 12, and the members
of the board are anxious to have as
large a representation of Nevada
farmers and business men as can be
secured for this hearing. They will
discuss such matters as the need of
credit, and matters relating to the
location of the twelve banks. They
will also investigate such matters as
prevailing rates of interest, land val
ues, the merits of various cities
which are candidates for the location
of the banks, the need for service.
and other matters in connection with
placing this great beneficent legislat
ive provision of the Democratic ad
ministration on an operative basis.
The new farm loan act will do for
the farmer what the federal reserve
act is doing for the business man.
Under it the government provides
the machinery for assembling capi
tal to be loaned to farm owners or
Intended farm owners, on first mort
gage farm security. The loans can
not exceed 50 per cent of the value
of the land, nor 20 per cent of the
value of permanent improvements.
The loans will be made at a low rate
of interest, not yet determined, but
not over 6 per cent, and provision is
made for the borrower to pay off the
loan and interest in small or semi
annual payments through a period of
40 yars or at his option. Farmers,
to take advantage of the law, must
associate themselves in groups of 10
or more and form loan associations
and then make application to one of
the 12 federal banks. The land will
be appraised and, if it meets re
quirements, the loan will Lie made.
The new legislation is expected to
