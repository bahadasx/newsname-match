In all ywarters tonlshl that the fSl
railroad strike called for next Mon
day mornliiR would ho averted. At
the cloee of a day of conference and
hearings Congress apparently waa
prepared to paaa tomorrow or Satur
day the eight-hour day legislation
which head of the employes brother
hoods have declared officially will
cause them to telegraph the code mes
sage necessary to revoke the strike
order.
Although President Wilson still de
sires strongly to see his whole legis
lative program accepted and Demo
cratic leaders In the Senate have
ideaa of their own about what should
be done, administration spokesmen
virtually conceded tonight that the
bill finally passed would provide only
for:
An eight-hour day for trainmen in
Interstate commerce, effective Decem
ber 1 or January 1, with the present
ten hour rate of pay and pro rata
overtime; and
A small commission appointed by
the President to Investigate the work
Ing of the law from six to nine months
and report to Congress.
Vote This Afternoon
This with the date, December 1, la
In substance to Adamson bill, revised
by Representative Adamson and Dem
ocratic Leader Kitchin after confer
ring with President Wilson and which
A. B. Garretson, spokesman for the
brotherhood, stated formally late to
day would be considered a "satisfac
tory settlement" and prevent the walk
out. Tonight the Senate Interstate
Commerce Committee agreed to report
out a similar bill, with the date, Jan
uary 1, and roads under 100 miles In
length and electric street railways ain
lnterurban lines exempted.'
The House will meet at 11 o'clock
tomorrow morning to take up the
Adamson measure and the majority
leaders have agreed upon a special
rule providing for a vote at 4:30

Klgdon In the Ilayswond Hospital
Here Yesterday.
Ixickjaw, or tetanus, was the cause
ol the death of young Clarence Rig
don of Dover, in the Hays wood Hos
pital in thin city yesterday.
Several days ago the boy was play
ing his home in Dover when he ran a
splinter into his foot. His mother pull
ed it out but inflammations set in and
the foot swelled up unnaturally. He
was brought to HayBWood Hospital
yesterday where it was discovered
that he had tetanus. The boy died
about 5 o'clock. The body was re
moved to the undertaking parlorB of
Myall & Calvert.
Young Higdon was about eight years
of age and the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Sain Rigdon of Dover. He was a
bright young fellow and well liked
by his many friends and associates.
The funeral will be held this after
noon at 3 o'clock in the Shannon

Letter Bent Oat By
President Nteicnu
Yesterday Mr W. W. Wlkoff, the lo
cal agent of the C. & O. Ilallroad, was
notified that an embargo would be
placed on certain shipments yesterday
and certain others today. The C. ft O
lines were among the first to declare
bucIi an embargo only about ten roads
being In advance.
The embargo orders are as follows
First; Effective at the close of bual
ness, August 31, on all shipments of
explosives and Inflammable materials
of every kind and discrlptlon and on
all shipments of live stock and per
ishable freight.
Second; Effective at close of busi
ness, September 1, on all freight of all
kinds from all points for all destina
tions. All freight as above deschibed
which may be in transit will not be ac
cepted from connections at any junc
tion points after dates Issued, regard
less of date of billing or date accept
ed. A bill of lading Issued on and af
ter August 31 and until further notice
must bear notation as follows: "This
shipment accepted subject to delay,
loss of damage on account of threaten
ed strike."
The embargo orders are causing a
great deal of loss to the railroads in
the country and it is hoped that some
agreement will be reached whereby the
strike can be averted. A strike last
ing a week would paralyze the business
of the entire country.
The river Is now at such a low stage
that it will be almost impossible for
packets to run heavily ladened. A big
strike would bring a great many river
crafts into use for transportation and
Cincinnati and vicinity would probably
suffer less than any other locality in
the middle west.

President Stevens' Letter
The following letter from George W.
Stevens, President of the C. & O. Rail
road, waa received here yesterday by
local trainmen:
Richmond. Va., August 30, 1916
TO TUB EMPLOYES AND TO THE
PUBLIC:
A crisis having arisen in the rela
tions between tte employca engaged
in train and yard service and The
Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Com
pany, and It having been decided by the
men representing the employes to or
der a strike, effective Monday, Septem
ber 4th, to enforce their demands, it Is
due to those employes who are affected,
and vitally Interested In this move
ment, and whose positions are placed
in jeopardy if a strike Is undertaken,
to other employes whose work and
compensation will be temporarily sus
pended by reason of the stoppage of
trains, and to the public whose com
fort, welfare and business activities
will be seriously disarranged, that a
full and correct statement of the whole
issue Involved in this controversy
should bo presented.
The representatives of the train and
yard men have demanded that overtime
shall begin after eight hours service
either on the trains or in yards, in lieu,
of the existing agreements, which at
the time they were negotiated and
agreed to were considered extremely
liberal. The term, "An eight hour day"
is a misnomer when considered in con
nection with railway train service. Em
ployes in this service are paid on eith
er the basis of miles run or hours con
sumed, whichever will produce the
greatest wage. ley other words, the
computation is made on the basis of
eleveu miles per hour, and if that aver
age is uot maintained, overtime on a
pro rata or on a more liberal basis
is paid for all additional time con
sumed. Employes in yard service are
liberally compensated on the basis of
ten hours of service, and when over
time is made the remuneration is on a
pro rata or higher basis.
The railway companies have pro
posed to continue payiug the men who
are involved in this movement on the
same basis as heretofore, and set up
a new account with each man, based
on twelve and one-half miles per hour
in freight Bervice, and eight hours per
day In yard service, and pro rata over
time, effective September 1st, 1916: the
supervision of the accounting to be
under the direction of the Interstate
Commerce Commission, and the money
to be held in the treasuries of the rail
way companies pending a decision by
a commission to be appointed by the
President of the United States to de
termine whether the employe is en
titled to the full amount or to a per
centage of the same, or to decide if the
present compensation Is adequate. This
commission to be composed of men not
In any way Involved la the rontroversy.
i tie unesapeaae and unto manage
ment, whose relations with Ita em
ployes have heretofore been so entirely
satisfactory and whose aim Is now, as
before, to accord fair treatment to ev
ery one In the employ of the Compauy,
considers this proposition to be an
eminently fair oue, and one that should
be accented.
During the period of nearly twenty-
seven years In which I have been con
nected with this Company in various
capacities, all differences between the
employes and the management have
been successfully overcome without
strike conditions being Imposed, and I
sluosrety hope that s considerable
number of the employes affected will
continue to nve the same oonfldeooe
and reliance la lbs maaagt in, ut that
taay have had iu the past, and remain
at work pesvalng a satisfactory adjust-
MM of the progs rit crtuosl eonditlons
To those Whose action will lb s Wigs
UmV be influenced by the iasurancv
carried by them In the order with
which they are associated, the Rail
way Company offers to take over this
insurance and continue to carry the
same on as favorable If not better
terms than they now enjoy. Any em
ploye who desires to csntinue in the
service and who will make applica
tion stating the conditions under which
he Is now Insured will be afforded the
fullest protection.
It is to be hoped that the public,
which is so vitally interested in the
continuation of railway train service,
will exert themselves to the utmost to
persusde employes to continue at work,
and will appreciate the Justness of the
Kail way Company's attitude.

The la A N. officials have decided
to operate their lines If the strike
order goes on Monday morning. The
clerks in the offices In Lexington,

They hope however that the strike will
be called off.
