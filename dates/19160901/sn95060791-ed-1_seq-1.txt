A Memorable Day for Masons
Saturday, August 19th, was a
day long to be remembered by
the Masons residing in Holbrook
and vicinity, as it was then that
the cornerstone of the new
temple being erected was laid
with solemn and impressive
ceremony by the Grand Lodge of
Arizona Masons. Grand Master
F. W. Perkins, of Flagstaff, con
ducting the services, assisted by
other grand lodge officers from
other parts of the state, as well
as members of the local lodge.
The day was an ideal one, a
large crowd of citizens were pre
sent and the local lodge and visit
ors marched from their present
hall to the site of the new temple
about 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
After the ritualistic ceremony,
which consisted of depositing a
leaden casket containing various
papers and lowering and cemet-
ing the cornerstone in place, a
polished and forceful address
was delivered by Past Grand
Master R. N. Frederick of Pres
eott, The lodge then returned
to the hall. The cornerstone is
a fine piece of work and demon
strates what can be done with
natiye sandstone in the way of
cutting, the work thereon being
excellent and shows the emblem
of the order, the date of the lay
ing of the same, as well as the
date of the establishment of the
lodge and the trustees in charge
of the buiding.
In the evening the Grand Mas
ter paid an official visit to the
lodge, when the first degree was
conferred, followed by a banquet.
The local lodge is especially
appreciative of the fact that so
many visitors from other lodges
and parts of the state were
present, among whom were:
Fred W. Perkins, Grand Mas
ter, C. F. Leonard,' Phoenix; F.
G. Brown, E. S. Clark, J. H.

Woman's Party Conducting Stren
ous Campaign in Arizona
(Contributed)
With the whole of Arizona or
ganized by districts and counties
under Mrs. St. Clair Thompson,
a brisk campaign of precinct or
ganization that is taking in the
smallest villages and trading
posts in this state is now going
forward, with Miss Iris Calder
head of Kansas and Miss Vivian
Pierce of California working with
Mrs. Thompson. The outsider
has but to look at the map of
Arizona to realize the enormous
difficulties of this work. The
distances covered are tremend
ous, the settlements in northern
Arizona covered being far apart
and covering country of wonder
ful wildness and beauty.
Skirting the painted desert and
stopping at Indian trading poste
and scattered ranch houses these
organizers have found college
women, wives of cattlemen, in
remote hamlets who have Ibsen
and Strindberg on their book
shelves but who have not seen a
daily paper for weeks. In this
democratic state dozens of these
women are turning from their
party to vote for the women of
the east, putting suffrage first,
and helping, and helping them
selves in the campaign by under
taking to reach neighboring
hamlets and remoter ranches by
machine or horseback. There
could be nothing more democratic
than the campaign of the
woman's party in Arizona under
these unusual circumstances.
The following additional women
are now undertaking the precinct
organization of Winslow under
the town chairmanship of Mrs.
ames Claffey: Precinct No. 1,
Mrs. O. W. Schlueter and Mrs.
Beatrice Bly; Precinct No. 2,
Mrs. Olena Trimble and Miss
Josephine Romero; Precinct No.
3, Mrs. Edwin Matthews and
Mrs. R. L. Walcott; Mrs. J. H.
Chapman and Mrs. Nellie Samp
son were elected chairmen of
membership and hospitality at a
membership meeting. At a final
Winslow mass meeting at the
Electric theater 300 men and
women filled the moving picture
house. Fully one third of the
audience were men. The meet
ing was a dramatic event in the
big city of Navajo county. The
speakers were Mrs. St. Clair
Thompson, Miss Iris Calderhead,
M.-s. James Claffey and Mrs.
Anne Gillard. Six young society
girls acted as ushers including
Miss Louise Dady, who has just
been visiting in Holbrook. Mrs.
J. H. Keys and Mrs. W. A. Parr
have joined the local committee.
More than fifty women joined
the Woman's Party at this meet
ting. Miss Iris Calderhead spoke this
week at the court house in Hol
brook and conferences and meet
inga were held in the following
towns, with a permanent organi
zation effected: Taylor, with Mrs.
Wreathie Wakefield, precinct
chairman; Shumway, with Mrs.
Ida Rhoton, town chairman;
Snowflake, mass meeting, with
Mrs. J. W. Clayton, presiding;
Showlow, with Mrs. Mary Lee
Beck, chairman. The following
women are active chairmen in
remote northern Arizona towns:
Mrs. Louise Sponseller, White
River Indian Agency: Mrs. J. W.
Clayton, Pinedale and Pinetop;
Mrs. J no. Peters, Cibecue; Mrs.
M. P. Morgan, Lakeside; Mrs.
Ada Frost, Linden.
In northern Apache county the
scattered towns were all reached
this, week by organizers, and
every man and woman in these
spots sounded or pledged for the
Woman's Party. Miss Pierce
covered Adamana on the edge of
the desert, the most picturesque
of northern Arizona settlements,
and interested the wives of cat
tlemen who had already heard of
the Dresent political fight for
suffrage for women of the east.
Miss Calderhead visited Navajo,
an Indian trading post and dis
covered two college women who
thrilled to the message from the
east and subscribed o' '"Pifc
Suffragist" eagerly. Mrs. St.
Clair Thompson went to Chamb
ers, a settlement of scattered
ranches, where Mrs. Ola V.
Phelps, a college woman, under
took precinct work, and will
cover the remotest ranches before
September 15
Durinp. this week Miss Caldr-
head will continue to hold meet-1
ings in Apache county at St.
Johns, Springerville and Greer;
Miss Pierce will work in Coconino
and Moj ave counties, speaking
in Hagstaff and Kingman, while
Mrs. Thompson will leave for
Preseott to arrange for a large
mass meeting at which many
prominent Arizona women and
these organizers will present the
campaign plans of the Woman's
Party.
Strike May' be Averted
The threatened strike of train
men on 225 railroads of the coun
try, wnicn has oeen called to go
into effect next Monday'morning
at 7 o'clock, may be averted by
the enactment of an 8-hour law
by congress. Both the senate
and house are rushing an 8-hour
law to passage and the chances
are good that it will be enacted
by Saturday night. In such
event the labor organizations
will call off the strike and the
entire country will begin again
to breathe easier.
Since the strike was called
nearly a week ago the Santa Fe
railway has been busy in getting
ready for any trouble that might
occur. Stookades have been
built at Winslow and other ter
minals, and a request has been
made by officials of the company
for the appointment of deputy
sheriffs to protect corripany pro
perty. This reauest was grant
ed by Sheriff Newman of this
county, and a number of de
puties will be appointed today.
J. M. Lee, agent for the Santa
Fe in Holbrook, as also other
agents of the company, received
Thursday morning instructions
to operate at least one tram each
way daily for the transporation
of passengers, mail and express.
Intending travelers are to be
notified, however, that the com
pany will not be responsile for
any delays after the time set for
the strike, 7 o'clock Labor day
morning.
The Santa Fe will receive pro
perty, except perishable goods,
livestock and explosive, for ship
ment after 7 o'clock Monday
morning subject to indefinite de
lay. Mr. Lee yesterday notified
shippers on what condition per
ishable goods would be received
for shipment. After the time
set for the strike perishable
goods will not be accepted for
transporation.
Mr. Lee also received the no
tice to employes stating that em
ployes failing to respond to call
for duty will be considered dis
charged. While most of the railroads in
the country are prepared to
operate some of their trains,
a strike of the trainmen if al
lowed to proceed would demora
lize business of every kind in the
country, and the prabability that
it will be called off before it is
commenced is cause for rejoicing.
Fall Opening Tomorrow
The first annual fall opening
of the Holbrook Mercantile Com
pany will occur tomorrow, Satur
day, September 2. This hand
some store, just equipped with
beautiful oak fixtures, will open
tomorrow for the inspection of
the public a very complete line
of ladies', and- children's coats,
suits and dresses. The lines
have been especially purchased
for the fall and winter trade and
they should be inspected by every
lover of good clothes.
Visitors tomorrow will be
greeted with attractive floral
decorations and an effort will be
made by the owners to make
every visitor a future customer.
