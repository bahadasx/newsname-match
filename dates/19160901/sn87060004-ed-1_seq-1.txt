AND MAKESJOU SICK
Acts like dynanite on a slug-i
gish liver and you lose a
day's work
There's no reason why a person
should take sicking, salivating:
calomel when 60 cents bays a
lare bottle of Dodson's Liver
Tone a perfect substitute for
calomel.
It is a pleasant, vegetable
liquid which will .start your liver
just as surely as calomel, bnt it
does't make you sick aud can
not salivate,
Chidren and grown folks can
tako Dodpon's L'ver Tone, be
cause it is perfectly harmless.
Calomel is a dangerous drug.
It is mercury and attacks your
bones. Take a dose of nasty cal
omel today and you will feel
weak, sick and nauseated to
morrow. Don't lose a day's work.,
Take a spoonful of Dodsons' Liv-
er Tobo instead and you wake np.
feeling great.
No more bilousness, consti
pation, sluggishness, headache,
coated tongue or. sour stomach.
Your druggist say3 if you don't
find Dodson's Liver Tono acta
better than horrible calomel yonr
money is waiting for you.
