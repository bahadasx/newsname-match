situation.1
The senate committee determined
there was too much opposition to the
Interstate commerce commission en-'
targrmenf bill to risk attaching it to
the emergenry legislation.
As the bill stood this morning the
senate committee had agreed that the
new commission should "consider an
Increase in freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the railroads
affected as may have been rendered
necessary hy the adoption of the eight
hour day and which had not been off
set by administrative readjustment
nd economies should the (acts dis
closed justify the inrrease."
May Bring Opposition.
Some members were seriously In
clined to the brlicf that such definite
direction regarding the rate question
would provoke opposition In the sen
ate from progressive republicans, par
ticularly which would make rjiiick pas
sage of the bill impossible.
There were indications this after
noon that the lahor leaders will fight
the proposal to empower the interstate
commerce commission to govern wages

will accept it if they see congress is de
termined to include it in the bill.
