4lMoeUU4 Ynw by Tinl WlrtlMr)
PAKI8, September 1. The Bumani
an troop nadar tb peraoAal eom
mand of their ruler. King Ferdi
nand, have amaahed tke first Hne of
the Auttriaaa . north of the Eastern
Carpathian mountains, and have driven
the Teutoni back to their aeeond line.
The whole of the Dual Monarchy's
lower lines have baeg taken by tbe Ru
manians, and they have retired to their
seeond lines, which . it deeper still in
Hungary. ' . '
Northwest of Kronstadt the Kungari
ans are desperately fighting to hold
, their ground, bat Vienna reports that
they were powerfess in the face of the
onrush of their newest foes, and have
fallen back to positions along the Atlila
river. .'The .new Austrian base is at
Cslkszereda and .to the Srrst of that
city they are hastily forming new e
fense, positions. ' , ' . ,,
All along their border the troops of
King reronaad are attacking utterly
regardless of their live,' determined to
gala all ib ground they can before
they die. Berlin report that the fight
ing has beta ef tht1 most desperate
eharaeter, and claim tnt tbe Austrian
troops have been successful ia stem
ting the tido at certain places.
The German official aoeounts add that
"the Rumanians have penetrated well
into tbe interior of Hungary."
It is now practically certain tbat
Bulgaria and Bumaitia will clash before
long. Despatches to Amsterdam last
night asserted that the split had come
already, and that tha Bumanian min
ister at Holla had demanded his,, pass
ports and left for Bucharest. - This has
not been confirmed by official state
ments from any of th Balkan capitals.
It Is certain, however, that Bulgaria
believes the time of open rupture is
not far off, for report from Sofia tell
of alarm over the prospect, and insist
that Czar Ferdinand ia about to ab
dicate the throne in favor of his eldest
Sou, the Crown Prince Brois.
Ferdinand Unpopular
No . official confirmation of this re
port has been received, but it is gen
erally believrd.iu well informed circle
here, as it is known that Ferdinand
has 'been intensely unpopular ia his
own country, and tbat a score of plots
against him have been unearthed from
time to time during tha last quarter
of a century, during which he has been
on the throne of Bulgaria.
No one attempt to 3 raw any serious
deductions from this report, but it is
pointed out that there have betn re
peated rumors of lata tbat Bulgaria
would be too glad to find a reasonable
excuse for abandoning her present
allies, provided she ou:l secure a
pledge from tbe Entente Power that
she would suffer no loss of territory
for the irt she has taken in the war.
It i known that a large BussJan
fleet is maiming at Constantia, or Ku
tendii. a Kuronniaa Dort on tha Black
Hoa, and Bulgar report are th batis for
tbe belief that a great land and
attack against tbe Bu;gartan port of
Varnar is in contemplation. Sofia at
least believes this, aeeprding to des
patches from tbat city last nlgbt.
Bulgar Town Taken
Another report which seems to make
the clash between Wumanla ana out
gsria inevitable is that which tells of
the capture of Bustchuk, just serous
the Danube from Rumanian soil and an
important-railroad center ia northern
Bulgaria. This town was taken by
tbe Rumanians yesterday after a spir
ilfd attack, according to despatches te
this city.
The Russians ara known to be hurry
iug reinforcement to their lattutt
allies, the Rumanians, and yesterday
huge bodies or Russian cavalry, infan
try and artillery war reported to be
passing through th town of Dubrudja
on their way west. It is believed here
that this indicates a heavy attack
against the Bulgar. taking their
--nioM no- ""eratintv in Macedonia in
the rear, is planned by th Wvs.

- Over Interference
CAmi I. ate ms Vy Federal Wireless.)
WASHINGTON, Heptember 1. th
administration has definitely decided
upon retaliatory legislation, to support
th diplomatic protests which bav
been made by the United States against
interference with American shipping
and trad by the Entente Allies.
The shipping bill, which I now ia
th hand of President Wilson, await
ing hi signature, and the revenue bill
both eostain provisions which, aoevrd-
ing to aa official admission last night,
are the Jirsf steps in the program.
Ooiajnsrclal Retaliation
8ertary of Htate Lansing ha been
holding a number of conferences with
leading congressmen, and it ha been
decided to empower President Wilson
to employ commercial retaliation for
the British bad French blacklist meas
ure, a well as th seixur of vessels
carrying cargoes , of American good
for neutral countries. -Th
shipping measure, a has already
been pointed Out, contains provision
which empowers American officials to
refuse clearance papers to vessels be
longing to foreign owners, which d
dine to accept American merchandise
for any other reason than lack of
space.
Mar Detain Foreign Vessels
This measure is admittedly designed
to reach and offset the allied blacklist.
It puts into the hands of United Htate
officials the power to hold np in Amer
ican ports any vessel which rffuses
cargoes eoming from American firms
named oa that list; ,
The action of the allied countries i
promulgating th blacklist ha aroused
intense Indignation ia many ajuarter
throughout the jaouttry, and ; heavy

that is frankly aimed at the blacklist
ing of American good.
Import Are Under Control
It authorises tbe President tj pro.
bibit the importation of products.
which can not be Imported into, for
eign countries from the United tatates.
'iaia section of the bill was framed to
meet the situation that arose from tbe
British embargo upoa American to
bacco.
Embassies of the allied countries are
worried ever the outlook, and last
night did not hesitate to predict that
the shipping 'measure, if enforced by
the American authorities, is likely to
load to a trade war between Great
Britain and France and the L'mted
States.
severing that link with Turkey, and
cutting the stream of munitions or wu
that flowed from tbe northern eouu
tries to the southern, and the stream
of cotton and food stuffs that wen
from south to north.
May Out Railroad
The presence of the Russiaus in
Rumania ia. taken to mean that an
early attempt may be made to cut the
Belgrad-Constantinople railroad and no
isolate Turkey, and draw the iron ring
still tighter around the Central l'ow
era.
In the mean time General Brusilloff
and his lieutenants are apparently
marking time in Oalicla and Volhynia.
They oan afford to wait and spare their
men now. The pressure that Rumania
is bringing to bear upon Austria it is
declared, will force the Dual Mon
archy to weaken her lines in the north
to meet the new peril. Then the Rus
sian can strike there, with good pros
pects of breaking the Teutonic linen
and to forcing the German to the
north of the Ualietan line, to fall buck
from their position a far north us
th Baltic ea. ..
Veaterdajr the German lefendinfc
the Kovel salient launched a number
of heavy attack against th Russians,
.but they were all beaten back and the
assailants lost heavily, according to the
account of the fighting from Runnia.
Houth of the Romme river the French
attacked furiously ia an effort to
straighten out certain salients in their
line, and general Foch reports satis
factory progress. e
'Bnlgari Lose Heavily
The fighting in the Macedonian fieldn
continued intermittently yesterday,
with the Herbians aud Allies slowiy
gaining the upper hand. The offensive
of the Bulgarians south of Monastir
hus been checked by the Serbs. Tbe
Bulgarian losses during the last few
days is said to have totaled more tliun
15,000, killed and woundod and taken
prisoners.
The effect of the fighting so close to
home is being severely felt in Greece.
Developments in Athens yesterday in
dicated that Greece is about to aban
don her position of neutrality, and east
her lot with the Entente allies. Staff
officers have been recalled tto their
commanders, and th army is being
made ready for action.

FERDINAND RISES

Ferdinand is the youngest; son of the
late Prince Augustus of Hate Coburg
and Ootha aud Princbss Clementine of
Bourbon-Orleans, the daughter, of King

and was elected Prince of Bulgaria by

Alexander, who had abdicated. His
election was confirmed by tttej'ott, to
which Bulgaria is in some degree trib
utary, and by the great power.
Bulgaria was created a principality
by tbe troaty of Berlin, signed July 13,
1878. It was ordered by in, treaty
tbat Bulgaria should be constituted, an
uutonomous and tributary principality,
under the suserainty of the Sultan oi
Turkey, but with a Christian govern
ment. No member of any of the reign
ing houses of the great European pow

dence of Turkey, assumed the title of
Cinr and satisfied one of his dearest

States, where there arc big rail
road terminals and yards that
