Macon High School Lattaf
To our County Pttroni:
For many yr our friends who live
close to Macon have patronixed the city
chool and the lift ol hth achool jradu
atea will show that e larfe per cent o"
them live outside of the separate school
district. During the past few years our
couaty : patronage has rapidly inereased,
due to the building of good roads. Last
year almost one-fourth of the total en
rollment of our school came from the
county outside of the separate school
district. These pupils stood right in the
front in their elass work and conduct,
and the co-operation of our county
patrons was all that could be desired.
This year we have worked to the end
that we may take care of more of our
county pupils and we offer the following
inducements:
1. We offer you a graded school that
ranks with the best in the state. When
our pupils move to other towns and
cities they most invariably are advanoed
in grading, and in no case have we had
any who could not keep up with their
grades even in larger cities as Meridian
and Memphis.
2. We offer you high school with a
sufficient number of high sohool teachers
that we are affiliated with all the state
colleges. Our graduates are admitted to
the freshman class of all state institu
tions without examinations.
3. We offer you building, equipment
and grounds unsurpassed in the county,
and equal to the best in the state with
the addition of domestic science which
we are adding this year,
The bu;v rite
splendid brick structure, in good re
pair, practically fire proof; it is equipped
with sanitary water closets; sanitary bub
bling fountains; the floors are oiled and
the house kept clean by a paid janitor;
each room has a library of the best
books besides a high school library of
about six hundred volumes; and the play
grounds are large, well kept and modern.
4. We offer you a splennid faculty of
college and university trained teachers
with experience. During the past year
we have worked especially hard to
strengthen our faculty and we believe
that we have the best faculty in the
history of the sehoot. The high school
faculty remains the same as last year
with the exeeptioe of a domestic science
and science teacher who is to be eleeted
this week. Miss Janie Stennis witl have
the hell and history and Miss Marian
Huddleston will have mathematics and
latin. Both of these women rank high
as instructors and made "good" in other
places before coming to Macon. They
are trained teachers with several years
of successful experience and have spent
this summer at Tulane University, New
Orleans, in better preparing themselves.
The principal will have charge of the
higher English work.
Our Primary and Grammar school
teachers are also strong. For nine years
Miss Lottie Hooper has been primary
teacher and her work is unsurpassed by
any primary teacher in the state. This
year we lost her. She is to spend the
session studying in Chicago University.
Miss Mai McCracken has been elected to
take her place. She has the same repu
tation in her part of the state that Miss
Hooper has in this section. She has
taught for a number of years and is con
sidered so efficient by the state depart
ment of education that she is assigned to
normal work each summer. After sev
eral weeks' work in Tulane this summer
she had charge ol the primary work in
the tri-county normal held at Collins,
Miss.
Mrs. Bvans Dorroh, who has done
such good work for several years in the
second primary room wilt have charge of
this work again. Those who have had
children under her do not hesitate to ex
press themselves as being highly satisfied
with their progress and with her instruc
tion. She is energetic, studies her work
and measures up with the very best
teachers in her field.
Miss Virgiaia Campbell of Bond, Miss.,
has been selected to take the place held
by Miss Carlotta Stewart who resigned
to become Mrs. Ches. Featherston. Miss
Campbell has bad four years ot success
ful work on the coast. She has taken
several terms' work in the Mississippi
Normal College. Supt. Guy Dean, un
der whom Miss Campbell has been work-
ing,
is so enthusiastic over her work
that he recommend her unreservedly, re
gretting that his county had to give her
up. All who have seen her work speak
of her in the very highest terms. She
was re-elected to her former position
when approached about the place in
Macon. The "job" sought her instead
i h.r uwkintf the iob. This is the case
with every one of our new teachers.
One of the most difficult places ia any
chool is the sixth-seventh grade room
For two yean the school authorities
have had ia mind Miss Lillis Mize for
.t.. nn.itinn. but this is the first year we
.... r , .
been able to secure ner services.

years' experience in the sixth and
seventh grades. She is one of the best
teachers in Mississippi in the higher
grammar grades and we feel fortunate in
getting her. State Supervisor of Schools
J. T. Calhoun, under whom Miss Mize
and Miss McCracken taught, says that
two better teachers cannot be found in
the state.
S. We offer these advantages to you
without any cost on your part except
that you furnish the transportation for
your ehildren. With good roads and the
necessity for coming to town almost
every day there will be very little extra
cost for you to do this. Heretofore wc
have charged tuition for the months the
county schools were not running, but
this year we propose to charge no tui
tion provided you send your children the
whole session, starting them when school
starts.
In conclusion I wish to thank you for
your patronage and co-operation Of the
past. We wish you to feel that the Ma
cOn Graded and High School is your
school.
The greit movement in school work
today is consolidation and with the uni
ty of interests and the advantages
that we have in oar school we believe
that it will soon be seen to be to the
interest of town and the rural commu
nities close to Macon to join school
forces at Macon, bring; in five or six
nearby schools into one school here,
and have one of the largest and most
progressive schools and communities in
the country.
Please call on me for any informa-

Letter from Mr. Minor.
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE.
Weitern Headquarters, Karpen Building.
Chicago. Illinois.
Editor of the Beacon:
The western headquarters of the
democratic national campaign is now
organized and everybody hard at work,
Mr- Vance C. McCormick, the national
chairman, was here for two days. He
is a very attractive man personally,
and one can see from his daily state
ments that he is well fitted for his job.
Senator Walsh is equally well fitted
for his western work.
I have just mailed out my first
week's output. You may have it in
the Beacon. This went to 4696 weekly
papers, democratic and independent.
How many are going to use it we
don't know. By request copies were
sent to eastern headquarters at New
York, and the printers requested to
hold the forms as they might want
10,000 copies for their use.
Mr. Cochran, my chief, is an old
newspaper man. He has been on St.
Louis, Chicago and other papers and is
Washington correspondent of the St.
Louis Republic and other papers. He
is an able man and a hustler.
The other day I paid ten cents to see
some war relics. There were trench
75 shells, shrapnel, a German war
plane that had been wrecked in France,
gas masks, Zep bombs and caps and
helmets galore, including some of the
death-head hussars. There were
plenty of rifles, too. And there was a
little fag doll without a head, picked
up in a Belgian village, Who knows
where its little owner is now?
Chics go is certainly an orderly city.
I have not been off the main streets
any except a little excursion into
Chinatown, but I have not seen a
single very drunken man and very few
at all under the influence of liquor.
Nor do you ever see any women on
the street who by dress or conduct ap
pear disreputable.
It is really beautiful to see how
street and Bide walk traffic is handled
at crowded corners. A whistle blows
and all traffic north and south across
streets stops and everything going
east and west surges across, and as
soon 'as congestion is relieved, vice
versa. I have not seen any person even
get in danger, but Gen. Sterling of
Jackson, Miss., was run down and
dangerously hurt yesterday, Thursday.
But two or three people are killed in
autos every night-joy rides mostly
with some other man's wife or some
other woman's husband. And one or
two people are drowned in the lake
every day; sometimes an accident,
sometimes suicide.
It is curious, but in talking with
Chicagoans I hardly notice the burr in
their voices, but over the phone it Is
horrible. I can't understand them half
the time.
The best joke I have heard this
week was a nan bragging about his
brother. Said he waa the smartest
man in the world. Was making a for
tune right now selling pretzels in Lon
den. Two Japs sitting near me
laughed at this-tbe firs' Jap I ever

In one of the most enthusiastic
citizens' meetings ever held in Macon
the Macon Booster club was organized
last Monday morning and plans started
to make the Chautauqua one ol the
greatest events in the history of the
county. The three days' meeting will
mean the mobilization of the county s
industrial, educational and social forces
for the good of the town and county.
The Booster club haa secured the
Radcliffe attractions of Washington,
D. C, to furnish entertainment lor the
three daye. These entertainers are
noted for their work.
To insure the success of the under
taking the Booster club was thorough
ly organized and committeea appointed
to do the work. J. L. McMillin was
elected president of the club and J. E.
Boggess was elected secretary-treas
urer. The Executive committee
is composed of the officers of
the club and the following gentlemen:
E. V. Yates. W. P. Patty. W. M.
Lamberson, W. E. Stokes, Rev. E. N.
Broyles, A. C. Fant, R. E. V. Yates.

by Supt. J. G. Chandler, Major of the
Blues, and John R. Dinsmore, Major
of the Reds. All the committees are
at work and a successful event is as
sured. The whole county is invited to co
nnerate toward makinfir the gathering
of great worth.
say nothing of Greeks, Italians and
Hungarians.
Until yesterday (Sunday) I have not
had time to digest the political situa
tion. I have written you other things
in odd moments and if you publish at
all you will have to do lots of editing.
The thinrs I wrot1 about interested
me and I thought might interest others.
They were written a la Big Bud.
Of course the reports we get are all
favorable, but good grounds are given.
California is considered probably
VVil9on. To begin with good independ
ent authorities put 33 per cent of the
progressives of 1912 as democrats,
practically all of whom will re'turn to
the fold; this is the figure for the whole
country, In California there is a big
fight on between Johnson, the bull
moose governor, and the old guard re
publicans which will help Wilson. In
addition the Wilson administration is
relied on to get many independent
votes by its peace program and other
popular policies and legislation.
Then, all assertions in republioan
papers to the contrary notwithstind
ing, Hughes' speeches have neither
aroused enthusiasm or gained votes.
On the contrary, his bitterness has
aroused unfavorable criticism even
from republicans. The democrats Beem
the better campaigners; our chairman,
McCormick, just lays it over Wilcox
every day. But the republicans cer
tainly have the majority of the news
papers, especially the big ones up here
and over the west and middle west
generally. There are only four demo
cratic dailies in all Minnesota.
I went over on a boat to Michigan
City, yesterday. Talked with two
men on the boat and one, a democrat,
at Michigan City. All agreed that the
democrats had the better chance in Il
linois and Indiana. They were intelli
gent business .men and their opinions
worth so. -thing.
The whole question hinges on where
the Roosevelt votes of 1912 go. The
democrats start with one-third, and
this is conservative. A glance over
the bull moose leaders who were big
republican leaders five years ago, who
have come out for Wilson encourages
the belier that we have a fair show for
a third of the balance. Getting that
many and holding the democrats,
which we will certainly do, it looks
like Wilson will win.
The administration has done so much
for the farmer and so much for labor
that it is reasonable to expect and we
get good evidence that we will get a
much larger labor and farmer vote
than in 1912.
We also get reliable information
that the German-American vote is not
near so unanimous for HugheB as is
pretended, and a slump our way before
November is very likely. And how
ever close the Hungarians and Ger
mans may be in EuroDe, here, politi
cally at least, they are at logger
heads, and the other foreign vote tends
strongly towards the democrats.
In short, at this time, every demo
crat ought to feel happy over the pros
pect. H. M.

Who Is Judge Clayton D. Potter7
j Clayton D. Potter is a Missis-J
sippian.- He is a graduate of the
law department of Millsaps Col
lege. He served as State Senator
'from Hinds County for eight
lyears, making one of the most in
dustrious and substantial and ono
jof the best legislators that Missis
sippi has had in many years. Ho
was appointed as Supremo Judge
after the insertion of the consti
tutional amendments. This posi
tion ho now holds.
Judge Clayton D. Potter is a
gentleman of intelligence and ed
ucation; a Christian gentleman; a
'man of honesty and integrity, who
enjoys the confidence and esteem
of all the people who know him,
both as a private citizen and as u
public official.
You Should Vote For Judge Pot-
ter in the September Pri
mary, Because:
! 1st. Judge Potter is thorough
ly and particularly equipped and
qualified for the position of
Judge. He is industrious and dili
gent, and is a hard worker and
capable of attending to the busi
ness of the Supreme Court with
dispatch and thoroughness. This
has been clearly demonstrated by
his record as 6upreme Judge for
the past six months, during which
time the Supreme Court has de
cided over one thousand cases.
Some of these rases had been
pending several yean. The badly
congested docket of the Supreme
Court has been relieved, as ia well
known to the litigants, bar and
judges of the State.
2d. Judge Tottor's friends
have noticed with great gratifica
tion the endorsements of him as a
man and as a citizen, as a legis
lator and as a judge.
Three Ex-Chief Justices of the
Supreme Court of the State of Mis
sissippi have written tetters giving
their impartial and deliberate opin
ions at to the qualifications and
character of Judge Potter:
Judge J. A. P. Campbell.

Judge Albert H. Whitfield.
It gives me pleasure to certify
that Judge Clayton D. Potter pos
sesses all the qualificatuttis required
to constitute him a good Supreme
Court Judge. He is very diligent,
thoroughly independent and has
already made an enviable record.
His election would give the State a

Judge Potter has received a
very high tribute from the mem
bers of the Jackson Par with
whom he has practiced for many
years.

3d. Judge Potter is now hold-'
ing tho short term, and ha made
good as a judge.
Judge Edward Mayes, Dean of
the legal profession in Mississippi,
says of Judge Potter:
"I beg to state that I have ob
served the work of the Honorable
Clayton D. Potter on the Supreme
Pencil of this State, and that in
such work tho opinions delivered
by him have been well conceived
and well expressed, and are cred
itable to him in his labors as a
Judge of that Court.
"EDWARD MAYES."
It is good Democratic precedent
that whre. a man has been chosen
to fill a short term in any office,
and he is found to be, efficient and
has made a good officer, to concede
to him the election to the office for
at least one full trm. Judge Potter
gave up a lucrative law practice
to fill a short term as Supremo
Judge. He has made good; and
Judgo Potter is asking the people
of the Middle Supreme Court Dis
trict to endorse his administra
tion, if they are satisfied that he
has performed his duty well, and
none deny that he lias.
A vote for Judge I'otttr's oppo

necessarily condi mn Judge Potter.

5th. J.idge Potter's record as
a legislator shows hitn to have
beoo connected with some qf the
most important legislation of re
cent years; among the measures
which he was interested in are the
following: ,
(a) Judge Potter was the au
thor of the Depository law. In
stead of tho public monies being
kept hidden away in the publio
treasury, it is now deposited
throughout tho State in all of thej
banks. This has accomplished a
vnry great good. Ia addition to
this great amount of money being
deposited with the banks where it
can help general conditions, the
municipalities of the State, the
counties of tlie State, and the State!
itself are receiving Tery large
sums of monpy annually by way
of interest on these depoaita.
(b) Judge Potter was the au
thor of the bill abolishing the Fel
low Servant Rule. The Fellow
Servant Rule allowed no eompes
sation where any other employe'
negligence caussd the injury.
(c) Judge Potter wee the au
thor of the bill doing away with
contributory negligence as a de
fense, which rule allowed no com
pensation for injuries where the
party injured uyis guilty of slight
negligence, although the negli
geuct,' of the employer mainly
caused the injury.
That the friends of Judge Clay
ton I). Potter are advocating his
election on his own merits, with
no intention or desire of reflect
ing upon his opponent, General
Ethridgp, who is a good man, a
good Attorney General, and who
will, if allowed to do so, render
valuable assistance to the State of
Mississippi as Assistant Attorney
General for the balance of his
term of several years.
