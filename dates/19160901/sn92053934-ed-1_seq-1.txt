Sheldon, la., Sept. 1. Bodies of two
men, apparently murdered, were dis
covered in cornfields near here today.
Both were fairly well dressed, but
there was nothing to indicate their

Much Complaint of Discomfort Due to
Delays in Getting Men Off on
Journey.
Fort Sam Houston, Tex., Sept. 1.
The delays and discomfortures which
most of the Illinois troops experienced
in leaving Springfield for the concen
tration camps at the border last June
were repeated in the departure of the
First Illinois infantry for Springfield
early today.
Although the regiment was ready to
entrain at 6 o'clock last night, the
men were compelled to sleep on the
damp ground until nearly midnight
and the trains did not pull out until
one o'clock this morning.
The militia men are Inclined to
blame the railroads for the delay.
San Antonio, Tex... Sept. 1. On
battalion of the First Illinois infantry
left here early today for the north

the border. Entraining of the guards
men continued and t was though:

King Constantine Abdicates
in Favor of Young Prince
George.
ENTENTE MOVE SEEN
Garrisons in Greek Mace
donia Surrender to Ven
Lzelos Committee.
London, Sept. 1, (1:25 p. m.)
King Constantine of Greece has ab
dicated, according to the British
official press representative at Sa
lonika According to this Information,
Premier Zaimis will remain at the
head of the government.
The correspondent questions
whether the entente allies desire
the active assistance of Greece.
Various rumors are in circulation
here in regard to the situation in
Greece. Reuter dispatches from Sa
loniki say there has been fighting be
tween the Greek garrison at Saloniki
and Greek volunteers recently organ
ized to assist the Greek regulars who
are resisting the Bulgarians in Mace
donia. French Suppress Fighting.
French troops intervened to sup
press the fighting and the garrison fin
ally surrendered and marched out of
Saloniki.
The press representative says the
king has abdicated In favor of the
crown prince, with Ver.izelos as the
power behind the throne. The new pol
icy he reports will be to work with
the entente allies.
Ward Price, to whom the above dis
patch is credited, is the official British
press representative designated by the
government to act for all British pub
lications in that area. Nevertheless
his dispatches are subject not only to
the Greek censorship, but to the
French military censorship which con
trols all lines of communication from
Athens. The fact that both censor
ships, as well as the British censor
ship in London, have permitted this
dispatch to come through, is, signifi
cant. Early Story Was Correct.
On Tuesday Mr. Price sent from Sa
loniki a report that King Constantine
had fled from Athens to Larissa. This
dispatch was discredited in London of
ficial circles. Doubt also appeared to
be cast on its correctness by dispatches
filed from Athens Wednesday, one of
them telling of coming meetings be
tween the king and the entente minis
ters and the other having to do with
the illness of the king who recently
underwent a slight operation. It is
possible, however, that the king may
have departed secretly from Athens, as
'reported by Mr. Price, and that his
absence was concealed from the news
paper correspondents there.
Crown Prince George of Greece,
whose accession to the throne is re
ported, has been described as a man
of liberal mind, in true sympathy with
the aspirations of the Greek people. It
has been assumed that if King Con
stantine's policy of non-interference in
the war should lead to his disappear
ance from power, their own prince
would be the man to whom the pro
entente party would turn.
Prince George was born July 18,
1890. He is unmarried. His engage
ment to Princess Elizabeth of Rumania
was announced in 1914. but owing to
the war the wedding was postponed.
The crown prince has kept in the
background during the war. When
the entente troops landed at Saloniki
last year the king sent the crown
prince to take charge of the Greek
forces there. It was reported several
months ago that the prince had been
sent out on a mission to the German
and Austrian emperors.

dispatch filed yesterday at Saloniki.

STRIKE BILL IS
CALLED INVALID
Counsel for Roads Tells Magnates
Adamson Measure Will JVot Stand
Law Test.
Chicago, Sept. 1. Counsel for the
various railroads are said to have in
formed the presidents of the roads that
the Adamson bill is patently unconsti
tutional as being confiscatory and
class legislation.
Ion, Topeka & Santa Fe said today that
passage of the bill would merely post
pone the strife.
"It is illogical to assume," said Mr.
Ripley, "that the railroads will aban
don their principles merely because
they are attacked through congress in
stead of directly by the brotherhoods."
R. II. Aishton, president of the Chi
cago & Northwestern, said that the
railroads would obew the law.
"But," he added, "it seems certain to
us that the Adamson bill, if passed,
will not stand the test of the courts."
A statement was issued at publicitv
headquarters of the railroads that
preparations for a strike next Monday
were proceeding without regard to
prospects of congressional action.
VETERAN PROHIB

John r. St. John, One Candidate for
Presidency, Died at Kansas

Olathe, Kan., Sept. 1. John P. St.
John, a candidate for the presidency
on the prohibition ticket in 1S84, twice
governor of Kansas, and one of the
most widely known temperance advo
cates in the United States, died here
last night. He was S3 years old and
had been in failing health since a heat
prostration two months ago while on a
speaking tour.
St John was called a "traitor"
when he deserted the republican party
and became a candidate for president
on the prohibition ticket in 1884. Dur
ing his campaign he was burned or
hung in effigy more than 500 times. He
was twice shot at, but unhurt. Many
republicans attributed the defeat of
James G. Blaine for president to St.
John's entrance into the race.

FIUFNUS AT COURT.
(Special to The Argus.)
Washington, Sept. 1. It devel
oped today that for three days past
some very earnest and important
conferences have been going on
between representatives of the
trainmen and group of members
of the house of representatives
who always have had the interest
of the laboring classes at heart.
Commenting on these conferences
the Washington Star of yesterday
says: "Now that the railroad
brotherhoods know that their
friends in congress are earnestly
working to arrive at a solution
and have shown every effort to get
eight-hour day legislation on the
books at the shortest possible no

better in the strike situation.. As
a result of these deliberations O
tentative plana are under way O
for quick legislation to show the
railway employes that congress Is
not endeavoring to dodge, side

EIGHT HOURS
WILL EVADE
RAIL STRIKE
House and Senate at Work
On Measures Approved
By President.
BILLS BEING DEBATED
Adamson Eight-Hour Law is
Taken Up in the House at
Early Part of Session.
Chicago, Sept. 1, Members of
the four brotherhoods employed
on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa
Fe railroad, will meet tonight and
request their union chiefs to with
draw the oidr to strike, accord
Ing to a statement issued today
by W. J. Black, passenger traffic
manager of the road.
Washington, Sept. 1,-Bnis to
avert the railway strike actually
were put on their way to passage
today in both houses of congress.
Under a special rnlo providing
for a vote not later than 4:30 this
afternoon the house took np the
Adamson eight-hour day bill ap
proved by President Wilson and
accepted hy brotherhood leaders
as a "satisfactory settlement,
The senate Interstate commerce com
mlttee rPgrtefl a similar bill, which,
however,' contains an Important pro
vision empowering the Interstate com
merce commission to fix schedules of
wages on interstate railways. It pro
vides that the eight-hour day shall be
come effective Jan. 1. 1917, that the
present pay for the 10-hour day shall
apply to the shorter day; that over
time shall be paid pre rata; but adds
that within not less than six and not
more than 12 months after its passage
the Interstate commerce commission
shall assume Jurisdiction of the ques
tion of hours and wages and that they
shall be subject to petition for change
from either the employers, the em
ployes, and the public.
The possibility for a hitch seemed
to be in this added provlson which Is
being sfudled by the brotherhood lead
ers. The committee eliminated the pro
posal that on the report of the eight
hour day commission the interstate
commerce commission "shall c nsider
an increase of freight rates to meet
such additional expenditures Ly the
railroads affected as may have been
! rendered necessary by the adoption of
the eight-hour day."
Neither of the two pending bills con
tains the Canadian commission plan,
which the labor leaders opposed, and
neither contains the government oper
ation provision. President Wilson Is
willing to let those features wait un
til after enough legislation to avert the
strike has been enacted.
President Wilson told cabinet mem
bers at today's meeting there was ev
ery prospect that legislation would be
passed by both houses of congress be
fore tomorrow night.
There were indications this after
noon that the labor leaders would fight
the proposal to empower the Interstate
commerce commission to govern wages
as the senate bill proposes, but would
probably accept it if they saw con
gress was determined to include it in
the bill.
At 2 o'clock Senator Newlsnds Intro
duced the revised senate bill and it
v.-as formally referred to the Interstate
commerce committee. Senator New
lands said that the committee would
report finally within a short time and
that he would seek to hold the senata
in session until the whole subject was
disposed of, even If it should extend
the session far Into the night.
Senator Newlands called special at
tention to a provision of the bill add
ed after the original draft hail been
submitted, which would declare any
person who wilfully delays, obstructs
or hinders operation of trains fullty
of a misdemeanor, to be punished by a
tine not exceeding $.",000 and impri
sonment not exceeding one year or
both.
Senator Newlands made a favorable
report from the committee at 2:80
o'clock and unanimous consent was
granted by the senate for Immediate
consideration. Senator Newlands
opened the discussion.
Senator Reed declared if the provis
ion to give authority to the interstate
commerce commission to fix wages and
hours of services were not abandoned
the bill could not be passed in time
to avert the strike. To pans the pro
vision, he said, would. Instead of stop
ping the strike, absolutely force it.
Bills Same la Both Houses.
Measures which will result In re
scinding of orders for a railroad
strike next Monday may be passed by
the house and senate under special
rule today and within 24 hours may
