after four days of rest at Estes Park.
Those four days left their Imprint In
the Governor's sunburned face, a
smoothing out of the wrinkles of
tiredness that had appeared from the
exertions of the first three weeks of
his campaign, and were reflected In
the Republican nominee's splendid
voice.
Dr. N. E. Dlttman, who has accom
panied the Governor, examined him
todav and declared him In perfect
physical condition. Thereupon the
dootor decided the Governor didn't
need a doctor any Iontaer, and left
the party.
Today Hughes had another fairly
easy program rear-end of the train
speeches at Hays, here. Junction City
and Lawrence, and set speeches at
Topeka and Kansas City. At the last
named place the nominee wll speak

Frogs Produced By
Artificial Method
Dr. J. Loeb, of Boston, Shows Eggs
Dp Not Require Life to
Develop.
BOSTON, Sept. 1. Dr. Jacques Loeb,
whoso experiments many years ago In
artificial production of life attracted
much attention, has succeeded, It Is
now learned, In developing male frogs
artificially.
The doctor Is at Woods Hole, whore
much of his experimenting has been
done. He Iisb HUcceeded In developing
frogs' -legs by two methods without the
Influence of life one by the applica
tion of lymph and the other by Incision
In the ogg.
A small Incision In the egg, even a
pin prick, will cause tha development
of the young frog, Dr. Loeb finds, but
he does not report any success In de
veloping other organisms through In
cision of tho egg. All frogs artificially
produced, he believes, will be male.
In a sclentlfio Journal, Dr. Loeh says
his experiments were made with frogs
because it Is difficult to raise sea fauna,
such as sea urchins, starfish and moll
uscs, to maturity by any means,
Dr, Loeh has produced seven par-
thonogenetlc frogs, which have shown
abnormal tendencies. It takes two years
for the species with which ho has boen
experimenting to reach maturity. Some

RAILROADS PLAN TO FIGHT IT
Will Attack Constitutionality of
New Law If Loopholes Be
Found.
"I've been listening to these tales for
twenty years, and they don't worry me
any more," said Chairman Adatnson, of
the House Interstate Commerce Com
mittee, today when he read a statement
by President Hale Holden, of the Bur
lington, that the proposed eight-hour
law might be "illegal" because It at
tempts to fix wages.
"The railroads have cried 'wolf for so
long when anybody has tried to reg

a rise any more. They have Just learn
ed that they are the trustees of the
people and not only of their stockhold

legality of his bill.
Railroads Will Fight.
Individual railroads will fight the pro
posed eight-hour law as Illegal, upon
constitutional grounds, if mature de
liberation shows It to hav any loop

This sUtement from the railroad cams

admission that the general feeling Is

Legal
opinion,' among the railroads,
differs, It was stated, on whether or not
Conrress can n wages aloag with the
elghUhour day. as It does in tha nresent
Instance. Court decisions have established
that Congress may fix a minimum wage;
the present bills do not specify that the
ten-hour pay for an eight-hour day Is a
minimum.
Railroad attorneyi are Inclined to
think, however, that Congross will keep
within Its rights. The railroads do not
plan to oppose the measure. And if
later the lines feel that the measure Is
unconstitutional, an Individual road
will make a test case, the decision of
which will apply to all lines.
Former Senator's Views.
Former Senator Charles Towne, now
living In New Tork. an able constitu
tional lawyer, was asked for his opinion
today. Mr. Towno ssld:
"I believe an eight-hour Uw applied
to Interstate railroads Is clearly within
the power of Congress. It Is based on
tho power of Congress to regulate com

Trying to Save Threads.
From a source In touch with de
velopments among thci executives It
was admitted that the railroads,
reconciled to what they regard as
Inevitable, now are anxious to save
what threads they mar by avoiding
application of the eight-hour day to
all their employes.
On this point opinion varies. The
brotherhoods have taken no position
thus far on whether non-union men
miuuiu ituu me uenem or ineir ef
forts. The executives hope the law
will be so Interpreted as to avoid gen
eral application.
Leaders of the brotherhoods felt to.
day that the eight-hour law will
pass. They are making no assur
ances, however, on this score, and
thev are .firm In repeating that the
strike will go Into effect Monday
morning If the eight-hour bill does
not pass by midnight tomorrow.
During the forenoon, A. B. Garret
son conferred with President Wilson,
hue was sIent as to the subject of
their talk, Other leaders saw Con

The few remaining railroad heads
conferred Informally during the fore

there will be no strike Monday.

Minority House Members Speak
Against Measure, But Don't

HASTY ACTION OBJECTED TO

With Principle, and Action
After Investigation.
Adoption by the House today of
a special rule giving the eight-hour
day bill right of way in thatfbody
forecast the passage this afternoon
of the Administration's measure to
avert the railway strike.
Although a number of Repub
licans bespoke their opposition to
the rule and the bill, there was no
demand for a roll- call on the
adoption of the former.
Under the rule the House will
begin a vote at 4:30 today on the
eight-hour bill. That the Senate
will accept substantially the House
measure was believed by leaden
of the lower body today.
After the adoption of the; rula.ip

tendance dwindled pending the

SENATE WILL FOLLOW.
That the Senate will follow quickly the
action of tho House became a praotleal
certainty today when Republican Sena
tors held a conference at the Capitol, In
the room of Senator Galllnger, and the
consensus was that there should bo a
filibuster.
"No obstrucUro tactics win bo wC
said Senator Galllnger, RepubMoaa
leader.
He said the bm. tn his opinion. wmM

No Senate Substitute.
At a meeting of the commttteo nafnea
by the Senate Republican eonfereno to
consider the question of a substitute bfTl
for the eight-hour amendment. It was
decided that no substitute bill should be
offered.
It was th feeling of the committee
that each Senator should be free ta
present such amendments as he might
s nt.
"No obstructive tactics will be used."
said Senator Brandeire. chairman of
the committee. "The eight-hour bill wfTJ
M Permitted to come to n vote hv to
morrow night, so far as the Republicans
ar concerned."
The Senate did not at once take up
the committee's hill when It recon
vened nt 1 o'clock. There was delay
In members returning, and Senator
Jones was recognised to speak on the
revenue hill.
.Tust before he started. Senator Tj

the chamber, to receive unanlmon
nods of preetlnir from th Democratic
side. T.aFollette Is on of the strong

Talk of a Substitute.
Republican leaders In the TTouse
this morning consulted regarding the
offering of a substitute hill, and th's
Is Dlanned. although there Is no t
oectatlon that the substitute will nre

pared today bv Congressman .1.
Homnton Moore. Uenubllcnn, of Penn
sylvania. Republican members of the
Interstate Commerce Committee ore
understood to he drnfting n similar
measure, but It will be offored more
to show the Republican attitude
against hssty, one-sided legislation
than In the expectation that the
substitute will ho approved by the
House.
