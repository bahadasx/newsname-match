Measure is Favorably Reported in Senate and Although Op
position Will be Strong Republicans Promise Not
to Filibuster to Delay Action on
Legislation.
Internt tiotial News Service:
WASHINGTON, Sept. 1. Passim nf the di;ht-luair bill de
signed to prevent a strike on the nation's railroads was considered
certain this afternoon. The enate at 2:U) laid aside all other
business and Sen. Neulands, a chairman ut the interstate com
merce committee, called up the revised bill previously agreed
upon by his committee.
It was then the intention ot the senate io remain in continuous
session until the measure came to a vote. The republican mem
bers had frankly disavowed any intention of filibustering on the
measure, but because of the elästicitv of the rules of the senate,
no one cared to forecast when a vote would be reached. The
meas.ire, however, was certain to pass.
Roll Call at 4:30.
When the senate took up the bill the house ha J its measure
well advanced and was scheduled to begin a roll call n tinal
passage at 4 :H).
The revised democratic strike bill provides for an eiht-Iiour
day and a temporary wa'Nre commission and y;ives the interstate
commerce commission complete authority over hours of work and
pay.
(iocs to Capitol.
Pres't Wilson went to tlie capitol
at 1 : 1 ä to ronfer with the members
of tho senate interstate commerce
committee and the senate and house
leaders to expedite? the passage of
the ei;;ht-our law for r;iilroads which
will re sult in the liiotherhood lead
ers calling off the proposed strike.
The president ured the senate
ami hose bailors to t together
;ind set the bill through both houses
today, if possible. He u.us under
stood to be confident that the pro
posed measure will be a law by to
morrow ni;;ht.
When the president reached the
capitol he found that none of the
IcadeiH were there so he went di
rectly to the senate ollice building
where most of the democratic, sen
ators were. The president went to
the room of Chairman Xevvlands of
the interstate commerce committee;
and took up with him and other
members of that committee the
draft of the bill which already has
bee.ii introduced in the house and
which is to po through that body
under a special rule which calls for
a vote commencinir at 4:.'h p. m.
Two Measures Identical.
It is the desire of the president,
officials say, th.it the lanuuae of
the two meiLsures shall be identical
so that if one house ats ahead of
the otho the measure as parsed can
be substituted for that under consid
eration thus expediting matters.
The president was with Sen. New
lands an 1 the other committee inem
1 er.s for 0 minutes and then re
turned 1o his otliee in the capitol
proper to continue his. conferences
with :-en. Kern and the other lead
ers. The l.einty of the morning led the
president to dismiss his chauffeur
and to stroll across the front of the
eapitol erounds on lus way from the
seriate- olhco building to the senate
v in;; jf the rnrun structure.
Pn route he was stopped by Mr.
and Mrs J. I. Flamin;' ot Pouhbr.
Polo., who tedd him that they we re
distant "kin folk" of Mrs. Wilson.
This seemed t please the president
immensely and lie e hatted with them
for a few minutes, telling them that
Mrs. Wilson had just, ic.-ivt'd some
bead werk from Colorado Indian.-
which traces Pack to purahontas.

the shorter work day with pro rata
compvMi-ation for overtime. The .su
preme court, the railroads -av. hits
in three decisions reee-ntly held that
congress has no jtower to ti waives.
However, it is unlikely that the rui!
roads will uiia- tlieir objection at
this time preferrincr to wait until
fter t onm'ess comide tc. m-j program
to see what, tlie outcome v ill ho.
In any event, it i- pointed out that
the d ate' to make- effective the pro
posed change- will be either Dec em
ber or- J. nuarv hist next and by
tliat time .--oniire-ss will be back on
the job. the campaign will be over
ith. and it will have time to work
ru; a , c-ral plan to prevent strike;
or loekouts on public utilities.
It is admitted by both democratic
and republican congressional lea.l
ers that the experiences of t he l.usi
few day; have brought home direetly
to the American tieojd"k the elanpers
whie li a Re-ne rttl r-iilroail strike pre
sent and that some plan will have
to be evolved which will make Xi
renewal e.f the present crisis im
possible. It is expeoteei that event
ually legislation whi be drafted
which will prevent such a .situation
and it is likely that betwe-en now
and the opening the ne-xt s. s.-ion
of congress in December the inter
state e-ommerce e-oinmission will en
deavor to evolve a plan which can
be passed on to oonyresis.
