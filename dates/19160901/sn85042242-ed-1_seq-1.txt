Vigorously.
Lewiston, Me., Aug. 31.—Progres­
sives united with Republicans in
greeting Theodore Roosevelt, who de­
livered here tonight his first speech
in the campaign in behalf of Charles
E. Hughes, candidate for the presi­
dency. A large delegation met him
in Portland and escorted him here,
where he reviewed an old-fashioned,
court-like procession, in which many
former Progressive leaders marched.
From the time he landed in Bos­
ton today from the New York steam­
er until he retired to his room to­
night, the former president received
enthusiastic demonstrations. IHis ad­
dress was devoted largely to an at­
tack on the administration and a
criticism of hyphenism.
Thg speech delivered by Mr. Roose­
velt follows:
"I come here to Maine to advocate
the election of Charles E. Hughes as
president of the United States, and
the ejection of a senate and house of
representatives to support him, and to
give some of the reasons why in my
judgment it would be a grave mis­
fortune for the people of the United
States to re-elect Mr. Wilson.
"I jnake no merely partisan appeal.
I ask the support of all good citizens
for our cause. ask the- support of
all gqiod Americans. And I not mere­
ly ask, but demand as a matter of
right, that every citizen voting this
year shall consider the question at
issue.from the standpoint of America,
and loot from the standpoint of any
other'nation.
Root Idea.
"Th,e root idea of American citizen­
ship, the necessary prerequisite for
patriotic service at home, and for ser­
vice (P mankind at large, is that there
shall be in our citizenship no dual al­
legiance. There must be no divided
loyalty between this country and the
country from which any of our citi­
zens, or the ancestors of any of our
citizens, have come. The policy of
the United States must be shaped
with a view to two conditions only:
first, with a view to the honor and in­
terest of the United States, and sec­
ond, with a view to its interest of the
of the world as a whole. It is there­
fore our high and solemn duty, both
to prepare our own strength so as to
guarantee our own safey, and also to
treat every foreign nation, in any giv
en crisis, as its conduct in that crisis
demands. The citizen who does not
so act,, and who endeavors to shape
America's policy in the interest of the
country' from which he or his ances
tors have'sprung, is no true American,
and has not moral right to citizenship
in this, country. Any attempt to or­
ganize American citizens along politi
coracial lines is a foul and evil thing.
Any organization of American citi­
zens which, acts in the interest of a
foreign power is guilty of moral treas
on to the Republic. It is because of
such action that I condemn those pro­
fessional German-Americans who in
our politics act as servants and allies
of Germany, not as Americans inter­
ested solely in the honor and welfare
of America and I would condemn
just as quickly English-Americans or
French-Americans or Irish-Americans
who acted in such manner.
Matter of Spirit.
'Americanism is a matter of the
spirit, of the soul, of the mind not
of birthplace or creed. We care noth­
ing as to where any man was born,
or as to the land from which his fore­
fathers came, so long as he is whole­
heartedly and in good faith an Ameri­
can and nothing else. If the man is
a good American we care nothing as
to his creed, whether he be Protestant,
Catholic or Jew we care nothing
whether his ancestors came over in
the Mayflower, or whether he himself
was born in England or Ireland, in
France or Germany, in Scandinavia
or Russia. Some of the very best
Americans I have ever known were
men who were born abroad and in
every great period of American his­
tory, the Americans who deserved
best of their country have included
men of different creeds men whose
ancestors had for generations lived on
this soil and other men who them­
selves, or whose servants, had come
from some of the lands of the Old
World. But all these men alike acted
as Americans and nothing else, and
with an undivided loyalty to this na­
tion, and not with a half-loyalty to

MILITIA CALLED OUT
TO QUELL RIOTERS
Lima, O., Aug. 31.—Sheriff Sher­
man Ely, who was tortured last night
until he directed a mob to Ottawa,
where he had taken a negro, Charles
Daniels, accused of assaulting a
white woman, for safety, returned to
Lima from Ottawa late today, 'Where
he escaped the crowd, to learn, that
his little daughter had died from
shock, caused last night when the
mob forced the jail while looking for
the negro.
The negro tonight was in the Hen­
ry county jail at Napoleon, where he
was rushed late last night, while the
mob was enroute from Lima to Otta­
wa to get him.
Early this evening, a large crowd
gathered in front of the county jail,
but there were no demonstrations.
Mrs. Cecil Kephart, sister of Sher­
iff 'Ely's wife, was said to be in a
serious condition tonight after being
manhandled toy the mob last night,
when it broke into the jail.
Militia Called Out.
Prosecutor G. R. Barr has called on
Governor Frank B. Willis to send
itate militia to Lima at once to help
handle threatened race riots here to­
night as the outgrowth of the failure
of a mob to lynch Charles Daniels, a
negro, accused of attacking Mrs. John
Barber yesterday.
Saloons were ordered closed at 6
o'clock.
WHEAT YIELDING BETTEt
TBII WIS EMCIED
Williston, Aug. 31.—Wheat yields,
where the crop has been touched by
black rust, are turning out better than
expected in many cases, not only in
northwestern North Dakota where
the damage was lighter than in other
sections of the state, but in the more
seriously affected sections. Fields
which were not thought worth cutting
are in some cases yielding as much
as eight bushels to the acre, a yield
which with high prices in prospect
will be well worth attention.
Reports from various sections of
Williams county indicate that farm­
ers are taking second Iroks at their
fields and are finding the rust damage
less than anticipated, although tb re
is not attempt to minimize the seri­
ous losses which have been incurred.
Early wheat in Williams county is
affording very good yields, and close
observers are mainly of the opinion
that if the expected high prices ore
received during the selling season,
Williams county ill reap good re­
turns from its wheit crop.

however.
Along the whole line of the lower

Northeast of Kronstadt, the Austro
Hungarians have taken new positions

Passage of Compromise Eight-
Hour Paper Would Not Be
Acceptable to Railroads.
LOYALTY OF EMPLOYES
WILL HELP CONDITIONS
Chicago, Aug. 31.—Passage by con­
gress of the Adamson compromise
eight-hour bill probably would post­
pone a trainmen's strike, but it will
not settle the patter, presidents of
three western railroads declared to­
night. They declared such a law is
not satisfactory to the railroads.
"If the men accept the Adamson
compromise, its effect will probably
be that of postponing the strike," said
President E. P. Ripley, of the Atchi­
son, Topeka & Santa Fe railway. "But
it will not settle the matter. Such a
measure might well be satisfactory to
the men, inasmuch as it gives them
what they are seeking, an eight-hour
day with ten hours pay. It is not sat­
isfactory to the railroads. Congress
has no right to pass such a measure."
Mr. Ripley declared that in event
of passage of the Adamson hill, the
railroads' only recourse would prob­
ably be in the courts. He intimated
this resort would be sought.
Marvin Huhitt, Jr., vice president
of the Chicago and Northwestern,
said today that even in the event of
a strike, his road had received such
assurances of loyalty from trainmen
justify prediction that passenger
ervice would remain unipaired. Mr.

Representatives of unorganized
railway employes tonight telegraphed
CongreFsman W. C. Adamson, at
Washington, urging that he include
in his eight-hour law provision for
an eight-hour aw day for the unor­
ganized employes also.
The telegram stated the unorgan­

nine to eighteen hours daily and it
is only justice that they should

to all officers and agents:
"Intending travelers should be noti­

above mentioned.
2. All shippers should be notified
that non-perisha/ble freight only will
be received and that subject to de­

3. It will be the purpose of this

to do so, to provide the transporta­

subsistence of the communities it
serves.
4. It is the intention of the com­
pany to move at least one train each
way over its main lines for the trans­
portation of passengers, mail and ex­
press.
5. The company will gradually ex­
pand these activities so far as may
be practicable. Officers of all muni­
cipalities along our line should 'be
advised that our ability to carry out
this program will be largely depend­
ent upon the effectiveness of the pro­
tection to the company and its prop­
erty which they afford.

Washington, Aug. 31.—Belief grew in all quarters here tonight
that the great railroad strike, called for next Monday morning
would be averted. At the close of a day of hearings, congress was
was prepared to pass tomorrow or Saturday, the eight-hoUr day
legislation, which heads of the employes' brotherhoods have de­
clared officially will cause them to telegraph the code message
necessary to revoke the strike order.
Although President Wilson still desires strongly to see his
whole legislative program accepted and 'Democratic leaders In the
senate have ideas of their own as to what should be done, adminis­
tration spokesmen virtually conceded tonight that the bill finally
passed would provide only for:
An eight-hour day for trainmen in interstate commeroe, ef­
fective December 1, or January 1, with the present ten-hour rate of
pay pro rata overtime, and
A small commission appoirited by the president to investigate
the working of the law from six to nine months and report to con­
gress.

This, with the date December 1, is
in substance the Adamson bill, revis­
ed by Representative Adamson ^qd

ferring with President Wilson, aitd
which Mr. Garretson, spokesman ,fbr
the brotherhood, stated today would
inn l|| finn| nn be considered a "satisfactory setle
|\\11U Hnllr K\ ment and would prevent a walkout."
The house will meet at 11 o'clock
IVVV tomorrow morning to take the
Adamson measure, and the majority
leaders have agreed on a special rule
providing for a vote by 4:30. o'clock
in the afternoon. The senate meets
at 10 o'clock to consider its commit*
tee's bill.
T0JPL0¥ES
Prompt Action Expected.
Only long speeches in the senato
can prevent prompt action, and the
senate is confident the minority will
not carry their opposition so far as to
make it impossible to get the neces­
sary legislation through both houses
by Saturday midnight. President
Wilson will be in his room at the
capitol when the senate meets, and
has arranged to spend all the fore*
noon there, aiding to put the legisla^
tion through.
While the senate committee today
was holding a nine-hour hearing, at
which the representatives of the rail*
roads and of shippers gave their
views on the situation, the president
held frequent conferences with mem*
bers of congress and sent for broth*
erhood leaders and urgently request*
ed them to rescind the strike order.
When the trainmen left, the White
House authorized the statement that
they had given no assurances.
Go Into All Night Session.
Although the program for action in
the house was clearly outlined with
delay, It was not until late tonight
that a definite idea of what the sen*
ate would have before it tomorrow
was obtainable. When its hearings
closed, the interstate commerce com*
mittee went into what promised to be
an all night session to consider the
various legislative proposals before it,
including the president's whole pro*
gram, with its provision for prevent
ng strikes pending investigation, and
for the drafting of men to operate
trains in case of military necessity.
All day the house leaders had been
declaring that these provisions never
could be enacted and near midnight
it was learned that the senate com*
mittee had decided it would not be
advisable to submit them at this time.
The committee agreed to report ft
bill subsequently similar to the Adam*
son measure, with the effective date
of the eight-hour provision January 1,
instead of December 1, and with roads
under 100 miles long, electric street
railways and interurban lines exempt*
