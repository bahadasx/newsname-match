TELEGRAPH OFFICE
SHOULD BE MOVED
For several years past, there has
been movements started at different
times, attempting to have the West
ern Unions Telegraph Co., move it
office from the depot, up town where
it would and could be of better ser
vice to all. These attempts have
been a failure so far, all on account
of the indifference shown by the
public, when it comes to a show
down. Now the time has come when it
is put up to you more strongly than
ever before.
Commencing September first the
Western Union Telegraph Co., Paw
Paw office will not deliver free, any
messages addressed to persons out
side of the one-half mile limit as
prescribed by Western Union rule 34
which reads as follows :-
Mesages wil be delivered free with
in a radius of one-half mile from the
office in any city or town of less than
five thousand inhabitants, and within
a radius of one mile from the office
in any city or town of five thousand
or more inhabitants.
Beyond these limits only the actual
cost of the delivery service will be
collected; the manager, will, how
ever, see that such cost is as reason
able as possible.
Now get busy and get the West
m Union up town, and get it there
now.
At present the half mile limit is
north side of main street at the
Dvckman house.
Ed. Bullard was home the first of
the week.

bring the good things to Paw Paw.
Let everyone boost for the show to

HEAVY PRIMARY
VOTE IS POLLED
Probate Contest Brings
heaviest republican vote
in history of Van Buren
county.
One of the most strenuous primary
campaigns in the history of Van
Buren county came to a close when
the last vote was cast last Tuesday
afternoon. The principal contest was
for the Probate Judgeship, and the
other contests were lost sight of dur
ing the closing days of the campaign.
Judge Killefer was most bitterly
opposed for a renomination, but won
the fight by a majority of 530. Paw
Paw, the home town of both candid
ates gave Judge Killefer a majority
over his opponent of 211. This
splendid home endorsement is parti
cularly gratifying to the Judge, and
is a high tribute to him as an official.
One of the surprises of the day wa
the close vote for Prosecuting Attor
ney. The returns as compiled in this
office gave H. H. Adams a majority
over his opponent C. M. Van Riper of
34. Congressman Hamilton received
a majority in this county of nearly
1000 over his opponent John Ketcham.
Mr. Hamilton received a majority in
every county in his district except
Barry, which gave Ketcham a nice
endorsement.
The vote on Governor was exceed
ingly close in the county as the tabu
lated figures on this page will show.
Diekema carried the county by a very
small margin, but state dispatches at
this time indicate that Sleeper is nom
inated, with Leland of Detroit a
close second.
There was an exceedingly heavy
vote cast in every precinct ia the
county, brought out no doubt by the
Probate contest. Several precincts in
the county ran out of republican
ballots early in the afternoon, and a
hurry up call was sent in to the print
er. The ballot forms had again to be
made ready, ballots printed, perfor
ated and numbered. They were com
pleted however in time to reach the
voting places in time. No possible
censure can be made on the Board of
Election commissioners for this short
age. The law requires that the num
ber of ballots for each precinct shall
be at least 25 per cent more than
were cast for Secretary of State at
the last preceding election, and more
than this number were prepared for
each precinct. For illustration, there
were 216 republican votes cast for
Secretary of State in Hartford town
ship, at the last general election.
Under the statute 270 republican
ballots were required for this precinct.
fhe board of election commissioners
delivered 826 ballots, an excess of
-" per cent more than the law re
quires. This plan was followed in
every precinct in the printing of
ballots.
The election commissioners could
not of course anticipate the heavy
vote over that of two years ago, or to
anticipate the number of democrats
who would call for republican ballots.
There were very few votes cast for
any of the political parties except the
republican.
It will undoubtedly be many years,
before such a campaign is again
waged in Van Buren county.
The tabulation herewith gives the
vote complete on every contested
office. Candidates in each of the un
contested offices all received the nor
mal vote.
