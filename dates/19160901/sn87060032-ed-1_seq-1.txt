Big Speaking.
Last ; Monday being County J
Court, and there being a large!
crowd in town it was the oper-'
tune time for the Republicans to '
give the Democrats a "lambast
ing" that they seldom ever get.
Hon. Ben L. Bruner, of Louis
ville, was here and being called
upon to say something for the
Republicans there assembled,
arose ana let torth ana it a poor
deluded set of fellows ever got it
properly administered to them
the Democrats of Knox county
got it. Dr. Bruner is a man
that is always loaded with a good
speech, and on this occasion it
seemed that he was overloaded.
Hon. J. Wes Perkins, Sheriff of
Whitley, could not restrain him
self when called for and pro
ceeded to take the little skin that
Dr. Bruner had left off of the
Democrats, and told those
present that victory in November
was oursjwithout a doubt if we
would only do our duty.
Are You Looking Old?
Old age comes quick enough
without inviting it. Some look
old at forty. That is because
they neglect the liver andjbowels.
Keep your bowels regular and
your liver healthy and you will
not only feel younger but look
younger. When troubled with
constipation or biliousness take
Chamberlain's Tablets. They
are intended especially for these
ailments and are excellent. Easy
to take and most agreeable in ef
fect. Obtainable everywhere.
Forest Notes.
The annual value of the farm
woodlot products of the United
States is over $195,000,000.
More people are spending their
vacations on National Forests
this summer than have ever done
so before, many persons travel
ing long distances by automobile
in order to camp in these public
playgrounds.
The rabies epidemic which is
cairied by infected coyotes is
spreading eastward in Utah.
Rabid coyotes are common in the
entire western part of the State,
and one has been killed within
thirty miles of Salt Lake City.
How To Give Good Advice
The bes.t way to give goad ad
vice is to set a gcod example.
When others see how quickly you
get over your cold by taking
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy
they are likely to follow your ex
ample. This remedy has been
in use for many years and enjoys
an excellent reputation. Obtain
able everwhere.
