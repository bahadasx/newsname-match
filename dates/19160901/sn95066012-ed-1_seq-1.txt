ton, Dr. H. D. Holton of Brattleboro
and Dr. F. T. Kidder of Woodstock

fair otticials and Rutland business

meeting had been called because of
the appearance of six cases of infan
tile paralysiB within the borders of

a repetition of the epidemic exper
ienced in Vermont in L914.
The governor was a silent listener
to all the facts given by the lair and
city olficials and voluntered nothing
until near the end of the session.
Dr. Vaverly called on J. It. Kstes of
Hontpeller, president of the Vermont
State Fair association, to air his views
on the subject and to give a rough es
tlinate of the loss incurred in case of
the suppression of the Vermont state
fair.
Mr. Rates gave his opinion In a fair
minded way. He stated that the
Wr a . - . .
vermoni state lair commission was
appointed by the governor and should
therefore abide by his decision. How
ever, circumstances did not seem to
point to the cancellation of the fair
Frank M. Wilson, president of the
Rutland Fair association, was called
upon next. Mr. Wilson, in the inter
ests of Rutland, bitterly opposed any
attempt on the part of the state hoard
for health to stop the Rutland fair and
carnival. He showed how It would in
cur a loss of over $12.otiO und would
disappoint the people for miles
around.

Be Completed Some Time
Saturday Night.
Washington, Sept. l. The house
this morning adopted a rule to permit
vote on the Adamson bill at 4.30
o'clock this afternoon.
Leaders of both parties in congress
are exerting every effort today to
bring about the enactment of legisla
tion which the officials of the Brolher
hood of Railway trainmen say will re
suit in the calling off of the big
stiike scheduled to go into effect
Monday morning at 7 o'clock.
Prominent republicans were of the
opinion t nut llie enactment couui ue
completed by Saturday night.
Washington, Sept. 1.- Belief grew
in aii Quarters at wasningion huh
night that the great railroad strike
ailed tor Monday morning would he
averted. At the close of a day of
conferences and hearings. Congress
apparently was prepared to pass to
day or tomorrow the eight-hour legis
lation which heads of the employes'
brotherhoods have declared officially
will cause them to telegraph the code
message nee essary to revoke the
strike ordei.
Although President Wilson still de
sires strongly to see his whole legisla
tive program accepted, and demo
cratic leaders In the senate have
ideas of their own about what should
be done, administration spokesmen
virtually conceded last night that
the bill finally passed would provide
only for:
Au eight hour days for trainmen In
interstate commerce, effective Dcy
Oember 1 or January 1. with the pres
ent 10- hour rate of pay and pro rata
overtime; a small commission appoint
ed by the president to investigate the
working of the law from six to nine
months and report to Congress.
This, with the date December 1. is
In substance the Adamson bill, rovis
ed In Representative Adamson and
Democratic Leader Kitchin, after con
twrringl With President Wiison. and
which A. B. (iarretson. spokesman for
the brotherhoods, stated formally late
yesterday would considered a "satis
factory settlement" and prevent the
walkout. Last night the Senate in
terstate commerce committee agreed
to report nut a similar bill, with the
date January 1. and roads under 800
miles in length exempted.
While the Senate committee yes
terday was holding a nine-hour hear
ing at which representatives of the
ralltoads, the employes and the ship
pers gave their views on the situa
tion and the propo-cd legislation, the
president held freipient conferences
with members of Congress, and sent
for brotherhood leaders and earnest
ly urged them to rescind the stiike

When the trainmen left the White
House authorized Die statement that
they had given no assurance. It was In
dicated that the president still in-
ended, if It became necessary as a
ast resort, to address a public appeal
to the men of the brotherhoods, urg
ing them on patriotic grounds to have
the strike called off.
Mthough the program for action in
the House was clearly outlined with
out delay, it was not until late last
night that a definite idea of what th

THIRD PARALYSIS
CASE REPORTED
Infant in Family of George Squire
III of Dread Disease
FUNDS FOR QUARANTINE NEEDED
residents of Bennington Apparently
Not Alive to Seriousness of
Situatio'.i. ,
The third case of Infantile paralysis
is repoited in the town of Arlington
in the I&mily of George Squires who
lives about two miles south of Arling
ton village. The victim is a four-weeks-old
infant that became ill on
Monday. On Tuesday the condition
of the baby was reported to show
some improvement, hut on Wednesday
there were symptoms which aroused
the suspicions of the attending physi-
Ian, Dr. G.'A. AUSSeU, who put the
family in quarantine. He called to
his assistance Dr. S. K. Gray of Fast
Arlington and a Boston physician, Dr.
Brady, who happened to be in the vil
lage. In the opinion of the three phy
sicians the case was one of paralysis.
Dr. Ladd of the state board of health
is to be in Arlington today to make
in investigation.
The road to the house has been
losed and the other children in the
family have been removed to a tent
.'mi yards distant.
The two children at the home of
Representative II. A. Unlet are report
ed to he much more conilortable than
would be expected. They eat heart!-
y and the younger hoy especially Is
reported to be making a rapid recov
er. Bennington people are not respond
ing to the call for funds yrith which
to meet the expenses of the quaran
tine patrol. It would appear as
though the seriousness ol the situa
tion was not fully realized. Five
cases of the dread disease nave al
ready been reported from different
sections of the state. The state board
of health held a meeting at Rutland
