Greece is in the throes of a revolution. King Constantine has abdicated
mid Crown Prince George has been proclaimed Regent. Greek troops til Lcshi,
Knrn, Burnu and Vodcnu huve joined the .rebels. Gendarmes have joined the
insurrection and surrounded the Hellenic garrison ut Salonica. Tho garrison
was disarmed with the aid of Anglo-French troops, which took possession of
the barracks. The revolutionists are administering that part of Macedoniu
affected by the revolt. Ex-Premier Vcnizelos is supporting the Zaimis Ministry,
which is expected to declare war upon tho TeuTon-Bulgar allies at any moment.
This information is contained in sensational dispatches from Salonica today.
Bulgaria has declared war upon Rumania, according to an official announce

Rumania comes tho news that King Ferdinand of Bulgaria, who is now in
Vienna, may quit his throne us a result of serious disturbances ut Sofia und the

to bring the situation in that country to a climax. Bulgarian troops, it is said,
will refuse to fight against Russia, the emancipator of Bulgaria from Turkish
rule.
While fSolitical events arc shnping themselves in the Balkans, but ofTor no
clear indication of the ultimate outcome, Rumanian troops are advancing far
into Transylvania, driving the Austrians before them, and the Russians are
pushing their preparations for a combined land and scu attack against the
