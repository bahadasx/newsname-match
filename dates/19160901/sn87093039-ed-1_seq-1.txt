THE STEEL PIANT TO BE
DISMANTLED AND SOLD
A Ten Ton Hammer Was Shipt Out the
Past Week—Mr. Moore of Spokane
Here Last Week.
A Leavenworth business man familiar
with the Washington Steel & Iron Co.'s
venture in this town, past week met Mr.
O. C. Moore, of Spokane, secretary of
the company, who last week superin
tended the removal of some of the
machinery, and in conversation with
him learned that the entire plant would
be sold for what it -rould bring. He
recites very briefly in the folowling the
history of the affair:
"The best laid plans of mice and
men gang aft aglee." This was the
finding in the observations of the poet,
Robert Burns, in his day. The strength
of this saying fittingly applicable as it
was then, can today be applied to the
failure of many well planned projects
that are to be met with on every hand.
Some ten years ago Mr. E. H. Roth
ert drifted quietly into Leavenworth
and made known a discovery. He in
formed the people of Leavenworth that
the mountains around Blewett contained
an inexhaustible amount of magnetite
iron ore; which, however, could not be
smelted or put on the market in the
shape of a manufactured product, in-as
much as when brought to the melting
point a froth or scum was formed which
adhered to the sides of the crucibles to
such an extent that the vessel was
rendered useless for further smelting.
Mr. Rothert's discovery was a flux,
which when mixed with the crushed
ore and put into the smelter, did away
entirely with the frothing of the molten
metal. A meeting was called to dis
cuss the matter, and when it was hinted
that the plant might be erected in
Leavenworth, business men saw loom
ing up in the dim distance the name
and fame of their beloved town appear
ing on the map like a star of the first
magnitude, instead of an infiniteimal
fly speck, and then and there fortified
themselves with liberal blocks
of stock. A corporation was formed
headed by Mr. Rothert and a board of
directors, composed of business men
of good reputation.
As the years rolled on the plant as
sumed somthing of the appearance of a
factory. A track was built connecting
the plant with the Great Northern main
line. Tons of machinery, rock crush
ers, hammers weighing many tons, and
smelters were installed. Some steel
was made, the quality of which if turned
out on a commercial basis at a lower
cost than the imported article, would
have revolutionized the tool steel in
dustry of the world. Experiments had
to be made: all of which appeared to
be aboitive of the results aimed at.
The stockholders and directors got
uneasy and would not allow time for
further experiment, demanding the
secret process —the details of which
had been put in escrow, whereby Roth
ert claimed to be able to make the
steel. This Rothert refused. Litiga
tion followed with the result that Mr.
Rothert turned over all his holdings in
the company to.the directors are with
drew his secret process from escrow.
After allowing the plant to lie dor
mant for the past year, it is now stated
that the machinery is to be dimantled
and moved away, and the buildings
disposed of at what they will bring. A
ten ton hammer was moved away about
a week ago. Thus has one of Leaven
worth's dream of greatness been dissi
pated, a dream which cost the stock
holders seventy-seven thousand dollars.
Approximately thirteen thousand dollars
of this amount was subscribed in Leav
enworth and the greater part of the
balance in Spokane.
Mr. Rothert has formed another com
pany and is still confident of his ability
to make the metal by his process.

ered that we keep our cigars in the

G. N. RAILROAD TO BE
ELECTRIFIED TO COAST
Indications Pont to That Conclusion—
An Investigation Under Way With
That End in View.
No one about the offices of this ter
minal point will take the responsibility
of answering the interrogatory in the
in the affirmative, and yet there is a
rumor afloat that will not down, to the
effect that men are here making an
investigation to determine the feasibil
ity of such an undertaking, but they
will not talk for publication. It is a
well known fact that at the time the
electric power plant up the canyon that
furnishes the power for operating trains
thru the tunnel was built, four years
ago, there was a blue print plan of a
duplicate power plant on the Wenatehee
river just to the right where the rail
road enters the canyon, a half mile
west of the town limits. It is also
known that the Great Northern com
pany acquired by purchase and con
demnation the power rights to the
Chelan river near the foot of the lake
of that name, where the power that is
capable of being developed is enorm
ous. There is also the possibility of
developing between fifty and a
hundred thousand horse power at Rock
Island rapids, on the Columbia river,
east of Wenatehee.
With the Milwaukee road about ready
to operate some 400 miles of its line
by electricity in Idaho and Montana it
appears not improbable that the Great
Northern will soon embark on an en
terprise of the same character.
Bear Killed Within Half Mile of
Town.
Last Sunday Nick Kincherf and John
Brender were up on the hill side near
the forestry station north of town, and
to protect themselves against the mum
erous bear that infest the mountain
they each took one of those effective
rifles known as Kragg. Before they
had proceeded far on their Sunday
ramble they ran across a bear, or, the
bear ran across them, and after them,
and what could a lawabiding. God fear
ing and bear fearing man do," says
Nick, "but protect himself," and he
shot the bear just as it was in the act
of jumping on both of them at one and
the same time. "Bear hunting on
Sunday," says some one. "No, in
deed," says Nick, "the bear was hunt
ing us, else why should he come so
close to town."

The Higher Up the Valley You Go the Bigger and Better the Apples Grow
Leavenworth, Wash., Friday, September 1, 1916
THOMAS-CULROSS MINE
WILL EARN DIVIDEND
This Statement Made by the Manager—
A Limited Amount of Stock to Be
Sold for Operating Funds
The Thomas-Culrcss raining prop
erty, consisting of six claims, located
on Culross island, Port Wells district,
Prince William sound, southern Alaska,
70 miles southwest of Valdes, in the
most rapidly developing quanz mining
section of the land of gold. About 45
miles from the Elaraar gold and copper
mines, turning out $50,000 worth of
gold and copper every thirty days. The
Granite mine, producing $40,000 in
gold per menth is only 12 miles distant.
The Cliff property produced $1,600,000
in two years. See government report.
The Thomas-Culross property was
located by G. M. Thomas who made his
home in Leavenworth from 1998 to
1908, when he located the six claims
above referred to, since which he has
spent most of his time in Alaska in an
endeavor to so far develop his property
as to determine its value. This was
fully established in the six shipments
of ore treated by the Tacoma smelter
as shown below.

With the machinery on the ground
and paid for, consisting of a Lane roll
ing mill of fifty tons capacity, track
and ore cars, dock and storage bins,
a 100 horse power Pelton turbine water
wheel with an abundance of water for
power purposes, lumber for an office

and machinists and mechanics on the

of which will be ready for operation
Heigh-ho ! I Should Worry
"^ —" : -
Mr J. B. Adams, candidate lor Joint senator from Chelan and Kittitas
counties is without opposition in his own or the opposing party, and in con
trast with the race for congress in this district, with only eight or nine striving
for the nomination, he will have an uneventful race.
not later than Nov. Ist, the Thomas '
Culross property will soon be in the pro
ducing class. The end for which Mr. j
Thomas has worked so long and with
so much faith is about to be realized.
All the machinery and lumber has been
paid for and there is enough money on
hand to pay for the erection of the
buildings and machinery. To provide
the working capital necessary to get
out the ore and operate the machinery
a limited amount of stock will be sold.
With the purpose of givine the old
stockholders the first opportunity to
take ud the amount of stock to be sold
to provide a working capital this last
offer is made in this week's Echo.
The character of the Thomas family,
father and sons, is well known in this
community. Mr. Thomas and his son,
Don M., are on the way to Alaska in a
twenty ton power schooner, recently
purchased by the company, to comply
with the. laws of Alaska which require
that every company operating a mining
property must either have a resident
physician and surgeon at the plant or
have a fully equipped power boat ready
to call aid in the event of sickness or
accidents. They will arrive there the
last of this week and remain there while
the erection of the machinery and
buildings goes on. It 'is confidently
believed that everything will be in
readiness to begin operation by Nov. 1.
According to returns made by the
Tacoma smelter on six shipments of
ore, the average value per ton was
$56.25 per ton in gold and silver.
The capacity of the Lane mill is 40 to
50 tons for every 24 hour run. Take
the lower estimate of 40 tons, then cut
the average ore value from 856.25 per
ton to even 825 per ton and the daily
yield of precious metal per day would
be $1,000, or approximately $25,000
per month for the 26 working days.
The operating cost of the property is
probably the lowest of any mining
venture in the country. The mill and
camp is located immediately on tide
water. The ore is only a few hundred
feet from the mill and the water is con
veyed from the head to the power
wheel in 350 foot of pipe and will de
velop 100 horse power, enough to
operate the machinery and develop
electric light for the whole camp.
A number of practical mining men
have visited the property and pro
nounced it one of the most promising
mining ventures in the northwest pos
session of the United States.
For State Treasurer
Mr. Calvin J. Carr, of Tacoma, a
native sou of Washington, four years
treasurer of Pierce county, candidate
for State treasurer on the republican
primary ticket will be here the last of
this week, he advises this paper. Mr.
Can is a fine young man who has won
the confidence and respect of the peo
ple of his home county.
TRANSPORTATION LINES
PROPERTY Of PUBLIC
This is the Ground Taken by the Gover
nor of Oregon in a Telegram to
President Wilson
Gov. Withycombe sent the following
telegram to President Wilson on the
railroad strike situation, in which he
takes an entirely new position that the
service of the railroads belongs to the
people: "While the railroads are the
property of the stockholders, transpor
tation service is the property of the
public. Land grants and franchises
were given with that implied under
standing. The American people are
committed to and believe in the prin
ciple of arbitration and the public wel
fare demands that this principle be
preserved. Where differences between
the railroad employees and the mana
gers involve so serious an issue as trans
portation service to the public, and
cannot be mutually adjusted, the pub
lic will and does insist on both sides
submitting to arbitration."
Transportation service is the prop
erty of the public." Those are brave
words by the Governor of Oregon.
The sawmills and the mines, the
farm products and the fruit industry,
the milk trains and dairy supplies for
the millions in the cities, would all be
cut off, and millions would suffer and
children would die by thousands.
Industrial welfare, the use of force,
violence, threats and intimidation are
as much out of place in this day and
age of th; world as is domination of
the world with .'navies or intimidation
of weaker nations by armies.
Do you believe in arbitration, in set
ilement of differences by intelligence
and reason, according to law and order,
or do you in your headlines and in
your news columns encourage the idea
of the right to tie up the industries of
the nation.
HIRAM JOHNSON WINS IN
CALIFORNIA BY 20,000
Over the Old Standpat Candidate Booth
—Foreshadows Poindexter's Election
in this State
The standpat republicans received
a rude shock in California last Tuesday.
Returns from the primary election in
dicated a majority of over twenty thou
sand for that Veteran Progressive re
publican, Hiram Johnson.
The friends of Senator Poindexter
confidently believe the same spirit ol
opposition to party bosses prevails in
this state. Congressman Humphrey's
hope of election is based on the sup
port of the republican state central
committee which is composed of all
the old standpat bunch that has con
trolled, or rather attempted to control
state politics. Congressman Hum
phrey can point with pride to his vot
ing record. He voted for everything
with a republican label, good, bad and
indifferent and voted against everything
proposed by a democrat. Just shut
his eyes and voted "No." If you
have kept up with the voting record in
the Senate you must have noted that
such men as Lodge, of Massachusetts,
and others of the same mental caliber
frequently voted with the democrats
when they proposed a meritorious meas
ure. Humphrey is of the kind that
would rather vote for a bad measure
proposed by a republican than a good
measure proposed by a democrat.
Benighted following of party right or
wrong has lost much of its force.
W. F. Bickel Has a Birthday
Mrs. Bickel, with the aid of some of
Mr. Bickle's friends, gave her husband
quite a surprise last Sunday when she
prepared a dinnen and invited a num
ber of his unmarried friends to meet at
the Bickel home. Those present were
Harry Matson, Henry Saver, Dan and
A. P. Nicholson. After the dinner,
which lasted from two to four o'clock,
the young men administered a remindei
of hi» years in a vigorous manner.

$1.50 Per Year
Democrats Coming Round
Says a democrat editor, "If, as is
urged in the senate, a child-labor law
is unconstitutional, we would better
abolish the constitution." But the
only senators who were arguing that a
child labor law is unconstitutional were
democrats. For more than 60 years
democrats have been arguing that a
protective tariff is unconstitutional.
They have made a similar argument as
to a tariff commission. Yet they finally
came around to the support of a pro
tective tariff on dyestuffs, and on sugar,
and now favor a tariff commission.
Moreover, several who argued that a
child labor law is unconstitutional are
now supporting it, on the eve of elec
tion. All you need in order to educate
a democrat on the constitution is to
put him up against a popular election.
VERY GRATIFYING INCREASE
IN USE OE NATIONAL EORESTS
Fast Becoming Play Ground of the Peo
ple—The Grazing of Cattle Is
Taking Place of Sheep.
Figures just compiled in the office
of the District Forester, George H.
Cecil, Portland, Oregon, show that 157,
689 cattle and horses, and 996,771
sheep and goats, belonging to 3,454
permittees, were admitted to the Na
tional forest ranges of Oregon and
Washington during the period July 1,
1915, to June 30, 1916.
These figures give an increase of
20,834 cattle and horses, and a de
crease of 11,669 sheep and goats, com
pared with the number submitted dur
ing the preceding year. The decrease
n sheep is accounted for by the fact
that many sheep men have gone: into
the cattle business. The figures as a
whole show a big increase in the num
ber of stock on the forests of the dis
trict. Since four sheew are considered
equal to one cow on a range basis,
after deducting the 11,669 decrease in
sheep, the figures show an increase
equivalent to 71,667 sheep.
The returns also show that during
the 1915 season the stock grazed be
longed to 2,952 owners, but this year
3,454 owners are represented, indicat
me clearly that the forest service is
steadily carrying out its policy of mak
ing the widest distribution among the
small ranchers adjoining the forest.
Six years ago there were 1,683 grazing
permittees using the National forest
ranges of the two states.
Violette Wins in $3,000 Insur-
ance Suit
In a fire loss sustained by J. B.
Violette last December a year ago
when the Overland block burned, the
Insurance Company of Pennsylvania
refused to pay a three thousand dollar
policy on the ground that the policy
was written by C. E. Hamilton when
his wife, M. F. Hamilton was their
accredited rgent. In the Superior
court of Chelan county, Judge Grim
shaw presiding, verdict for the company
was rendered. The supreme court
reversed the rinding of the lower court.
Hughes, Sumner & Adams represented
Violette.
Leavenworth Tourists Coming In
Whether the impending railroad
strike or some other cause is respon
sible we do not undertake to say, but
the fact remains after all probable
causes have been subtracted, that for
the past few days Leaven'.vorth tourists
have been coming back at the rate of
from two to half a dozen every day.
The prospect of a tie up after Monday,
no doubl had to do with the return of
those who used the railroads. The
opening of school August the Bth was
a good excuse for those who had child
ren within the scholastic age, while
those who were away on an auto tour
had no excuse other than the possible
shortage of gasoline or the fact that
their outing had come to an end. Any
way, by the last of this week nearly
I everybody will be at home to all callers.
