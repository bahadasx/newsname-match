Phoenix Arizona Sepi 1
The liquor interests now fight-
1 ing to secure the adoption t of an
amendment to the State
tiition which wouldf kill prohibi
tion by enacting in its stead local
option are discouraged There
was a time prior to the handing
down of the personal use de
cision by the Supreme Court
when it seemed probable that
King Alcohol might succeed in
putting over the law they
wanted But the right to import
liquor for personal use has
parently pleased a sufficient num
ber of liquor users to such an ex
K tent that they are not now inter-
ested in voting to bring back the
saloon As a consequence the
best indications are that local
option will fail
But personal use has not been
the only blow dealt the liquor in
terests Strange to say their
greatest trouble has been caused
them by their best friends They
are now accused of playing parti
san politics and from the evi
dence which has been dug up it
looks as if the charge is correct
A charge has been made and
they are accused of furnishing
atleastapart of the money to
re nominate Hunt for a fourth
term It will be recalled that
some 10000 names dhmore were
secured for Ihe local ontion in
itiative petition Petition cirj
JJSSaMrj of the State-
worked zealously to get signers
In doing this work it now de
velops that the whiskey ring used
to a great extent those individ
uals throughout the State who
were managing Hunts interests
in his campaign that there yeas
aclose alliance is now not denied
If the facts disclosed by a
search of the records arecon
iclusiVe it seems that thecharge
against the liquor men is well
founded Most of what has been
ascertained came tolight through
a perusal of the initiative peti
tions on file at the Capitol Many
of the circulators of the wet peti
tions are now at the head of the
Hunt campaign committees in
the State
The most flagrant case of all
is that of L Gutierrez De Lara
and pictures have been made of
one of the several whisky peti
i tions he circulated With it is a
picture of the handbill announc
ing De Laras I meeting which
was held in the interests of the
local option petition as well as
Governor Hunt De Lara
j dently could see nothing wrong
in working jointly for Hunts re-
v election and against prohibition
But he was not the only man
high up in the organization that
the search of the past few days
- has shown was intimately and
prominently connected with the
4 whiskey rings move for local
i option Frank Brown- Influential
in Western Federation of Miners
circles managed the circulation
of the local option petitions thru-
out Southern Arizona and ap
pointed most of the wet petition
circulators Of course Brown
was for Hunt He was once nix
named by Hunt to be and served
as superintendent of the Boys
and Girls Reform School then
at Benson now at Fort Grant
It was evidently easy for Brown
to make a Hunt and whiskey
campaign for his heart was set
that both should win
fJut there are others implicated
the situation besides Brown
and Ie Lara the same De Lara
who was in the Clifon Morenci
Tigfrict during vthe recent strike
H9 chief agitator McLean a
prominent Miami Hunt Club
man circulated whiskey- peti
tions and Rogers of Jerome
Dietrick of Mohave county and
SilvaB of Tucson thoy are all
shown up in the disclosures Just
brought to light in -connection
with the Hunt apd whiskey ring
scandal
And evidently these troubles
are not enough to heap on the
heads of the whiskey group for
Mother Jones followed and in
aH of her speeches made since

eyites to explain They do not
deny that Mother Jones divided
her time hfllf for whiskey and
half for Hunt
The fact that all concerned in
aiding the fight againBt prohibi
tion are giving part of their time
in the fight for Hunt has made it
easy for the accusers of the
whiskey crowd to claim that the
whiskey trust Is backing Hunts
campaign and it has killed their
chances and makec them sad
It Is a funny combination of af
fairs and one causing many sides
to make explanations

S AFFORD GRAHAM COTJNY ARIZONA SEPTEMBER 11916
The aboye picture shows one of the anti prohibition petitions nowon file at the Capitol building
Phoenix which was circulated and sworn to by Lf Gutierrez De Lara On Sunday night June llUi De
Lara held a Hunt meeting in Mojaye County and also spoke in favor of the anti prohibition law The
following day he circulated the anti prohibition petition as the date beneath his signature indicated The
line on the handbill Endorsed by Governor Hunt is one of several reasons justifying the charge that
the liqupr people were concerned in his candidacy The acts of De Lara were duplicated it is said by
other Hunt and whiskeyworkers

WORKING FOR HUNT
Convicted Bank Robber
Is -Soliciting Votes in
County
About fourteen months ago
two men one of whom was named
Hale held up the Bank of Dun
can at Duncan Arizona in broad
daylight They locked the cashier
in the vault where he would
have suffocated if a friend had
not happened in after the rob
bers left and set him free
The robbers secured a large
sum of money and ed a gay life
in New Mexico where they were
arrested several months later and
brought back to Clifton and tried
on the charge of holding up the
Duncan Bank They were con
victed and sentenced to serve a
term in the penitentiary at Flor
ence
Several days ago one of the
convicts Hale appeared in Dun
can with Sheriff Cash Hale was
dressed in the latest fashion and
was looking fine as if he was
leadinc the easy life of a retired
capitalist and enjoying all of the
gooa tnings oi tne worm
Both men dined in the best
restaurant in town and after
dinner strolled around town
Convict Hale as he passed the
Bank of Duncan thought he
would call upon the cashier he
had robbed at the point of a pistol
and- locked up in a vault So he
walked into the bank and re
peated the words he used when
he held up the cashier
I have a little check here
which I wish you would cash
The cashier looked up but this
time it was not into the muzzle
ol a six shooter but into the
smiling countenance of the man
who had robbed him af ew months
ago a well dressed happy human
whom he supposed was serving
his ten years sentence at the
Florence penitentiary
The cashier was somewhat
surprised but was undoubtedly
glad his caller was evidently on
friendly visit arid not there JorJ
tne purpose oi anoiuer xiom up
The citizens of Duncan who
recognized Convict Hale were
nonplussed at the mans appear
anceand wondered what he was
doing in their town when they
supposed him to be in the peni
tentiary at Florence
tThejrvsoon learned however
that the well dressed convieiwas
making a tour of Greenlee county
