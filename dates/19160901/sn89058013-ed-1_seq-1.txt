MAKES GOOD FARMER.
Jackson, Tenn., August 28. A
renter's son, Auzie Martindale,
aged 13, living near here, has a
fine acre of corn and -five acres of
cotton that he has worked with
very great success. '
County Agent Judd Brooks re
cently visited young Martindale
cud found his crops in fine condi
tion. He was plowing under a
'large-crop of Japan clover on one
acre, planning to put that acre in
crimson clover foripig pasture and
then in the spring turn-under the
crimson clover for corn.
"Few boys," said Mr. Brooks,
''have taken as much interest in
clover as young Martindale, but
this year many of them are seeing
that it is to their advantage in our
boys' club work."
Martindale is planning to' make
farming a profession.
COWELL CHAPEL.
Some from this community are
attending the meeting at Morris
Chapel.
Sunday school was well attended
Sunday, but a hundred or more
could have been seated if they had
leen present.
Another good rain fell' here last
Sunday evening. It interfered
'with saving hay and fodder, but
ifine on turnips.
. The Alfalfa Club boys are pre
paring the soil for sowing this
eek. The club of five in this
section have been doing good work
on their plots and we hope to get
.lfalfa started tliis year. We have
a communication from J. C. Mc
Amie, who will be here this week
The writer-had the pleasure of
attending a few services at Camden
last week, and no occasion to regret
it. However, we ' failed to attend
the ball game at Wyly Park on
. -Friday afternoon. -We don't re
gret it, either; iu'"fact we have not
atteuded a ball game in ten years.
The school building is nearing
-'completion, and we hope to have it
' Teady by next Mouday. It occurs
to us that where 50 or CO pupils
are assembled together for teach
ing or training ther if urgent need
o two teachers. Qnr,.gi-eutet her
itage is to clothe our children with
the armor of education, the only
powefThat will can successfully
combat and overcome evil.
LAKE COWELL.
The passing of Lake -Cowell,
which is being drained by the
Nashville, Chattanooga and St.
Louis Railway Co., means the dis
appearance of another landmark
within the environment of Camden.
Time was when the writer often
enjoyed a plunge in the placid
waters of the lake and'( were it not
for the leeches) we would enjoy it
again. However, the opportunity
will soon have passed away.
We are told that the roadbed of
the new right of way will be several
feet below the bottom of the lake,
hence the necessity of drawing off
the water.
' Since the recent rains the water
of the lake has been lowered about
three feet, and soon only the fish
and leeches will be left to tell the
tale, for the snakes and turtles
abandoned the lake as soon as its
waters began to recede.
A TRUE PROGRESSIVE.
Judge Albert D. Nortoni, the
Missouri Progressive chieftain
heretofore intimately associated
with Roosevelt and other Progres
sive leaders and candidate for
Governor of Missouri on the Pro
gressive ticket in 1912, has an
nounced his support of 'President
Wilson and will take an .active part
tin his campaign. He has resigned
from the Missouri Appellate Court,
to which he was elected for a
twelve-year-term as a Republican,
so that he can consistently support
the Democratic candidate.
Judge Nortoni Bays that Wilson
has demonstrated real Progressive
ideals, while Hughes is a typical
New York lawyer wedded to the
ideas and ideals of Big 'Business.
He contrasts the 'Federal reserve
law, the rural credits law, the child
labor law, the proposed scientific
tariff commission and the shipping
bill, all Wilson measures, with
Hughes' opposition as Governor of
NewvYork to the income tax amend
ment and his veto of the two-cent
fare rate bill, and the total lack, as
evidenced by his speeches,- of any
real constructive program.,
Judge 'Nortoni asserts that a
great many true Progressives, re
senting the betrayal of the party
by former Bull Moose leaders, will
support Wilson.
HOLLADAY.
Annie 'Laura, little daughter 6f
John and Bettie Whitfield, died of
infantile paralysis, agedl year, 2
months and 14 days. Dear par
ents, grieve not as those who have
no hope; remember that the blessed
Savior said "Of such is the King
dom of Heaven.
'Let us so live that when the call
is made we will cross over the si
lent stream and meet little Annie
who has gone to live witlfGod and
the holy angels, where a new white
crown awaits her in a home pre
pared in-Heaven, where the Savior
has gone and where angels dwelli
where farewells are never spoken
where family circles are never
broken, where golden harps fill the
air with -soft, sweet music, where
angels bright "in robes of white
walk the streets Of endless light
and where ere long we we will join
their sou g in that fair land of the
angel band,
-Faithfully,
W. L. Neal.

A NARROW ESCAPE.
Some of the men working with
the dredger crew at thesand cuton
the railroad 3 miles west of Cam
den -feel like they had a narrow
escapeFriday tin order to draw
Off the water ahead of the steam
shovel they were engaged in open
ing a trench about nine feet deep.
A short time after the men knocked
off work Friday the walls of the
trench caved in.
Besides the sand the-soil at that
place contains a thick -stratta- of

menced the workmen constructing
trenches would frequently return
in the morning to find their work
of the previous day obliterated by
the sliding soil.

Luke xv .2. Reader, the above
declaration, while uttered in malice
and hatred by the pharasees aud
scribes because . Jesus -mixed and
mingled with, as we would say,
the down-and-outs, the publicans
and sinners, is the very glory of
the (Gospel. 'It is a. message we
would convey to the earth's utmost
bound. Ah, what a great, what-a
beautiful sermon those self-righteous
people unconsciously preached.
"'This Man receiveth sinners."
That He might find and rescue
wandering, perishing mankind,
Jesus left the realms of glory.

Him? Remember He waits to re

eternal woe and despair, for by
Him and Him only can we enter
into eternal life.

CONFIDENT OF
THE y ERDICT
It is clearly evident in the delib
erations which have been in prog
ress at AVashingtonover the threat
ened nation-wide strike that public
opinion is destinedto play a lead
ing part in IhejEnal adjustment of
the matters in controversy.
That the railroad heads havertr
plicit confidence in the verdict of
the people is shown, very forcefully
in the statenent of Elisha Len'cf
the Peuusylvauia. Railroad whei:
he says, fIf these wage demands
are just in whole or in part, then a
public tribunal, appointed by th
President as we have urged, would
speedily, so determine.
"The weight of public opinion,
must determine this issue, " he con
tinues. "We can not believe that
it is the calm judgment of the
country that we should sacrifice
the principle of arbitration in in
dustrial disputes under a threat to
tie up the commerce of the coun
try." It must be born in .mind that the
public the third f party in this
case will be called upon to bear
the burden of additional cost which
the demands of the brotherhoods
will carry, if granted. The de
mands are too heavy for the rail
roads to meet and pay a fair return
upon investment. ; To grant them
would mean that all improvements
in the way of extensions and bet
terments would have to cease.
And this in the face of the fact
that in 1915 fewer miles of new
railroad were constructed in the
United States than for- any one
year since the Civil War.
In the event of a nation-wide
strike and the -stopping of trains
the public-would suffer perhaps as
much as the railroads. Industries
dependent upon transportation
would have to close down aud
thousands upon thousands of em
ployees would be thrown out of
work.
And the public Bhould know that
this state of affairs is to be brought
about by one-seventh of the men
in railroad service. It would mean
that 100,000,000 citizens of the na
tion are to be inconvenienced be
cause 350,000 of the highefct paid
workmen in the couutry want-more
wages.
It is: hardly conceivable-that the
public will sit idly, by and submit
without . protest. Such protest
have already been registered in
Washington from thousands o
business men, commercial orgaui
zationand bankers over thecountry"
These are-some of the thinge
that are bound to influence public
opinion and these facts, known to
the heads of the railroads, have
caused them to speak out to con
tend for the principle of arbitration,
and to agree to submit their case
to the people. '
They feel confident of the ver
dict. They have an abiding faith
iu the-fiuding of the jury of "pub
lic opinion." For when the facts
are known there can be but one
' .
answer.
The New Mexico Baptist Con
vention was organized in 1900 with
1,000 members iu the territory.
The number is now 5,000, grouped
iu 138 churches. There are liter
ally hundreds of New Mexican vil
lages in which no evaugelical ser
vices are held.
