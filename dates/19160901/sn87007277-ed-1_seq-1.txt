HARRY LORD IS POOR LOSER
Sport Writer on Lawrence Telegram
Makes Reply to Ex-Manager's
Strictures on Reporters.
Commenting on Harry Turd's .fu
tures on baseball reporters, who are
blamed by the ex-Lowell manager for
his failure as a team leader, M. H.
Lynch, la the Lawrence Telegram,
writes :
"We cannot agree with Lord In his
statement about the Lowell writers,
as they have always, in our opinion,
been loyal to baseball and hip hnnsto

criticized, but probably Justly, and
with the sole purpose that such criti
cism might result In better (hint's for

Stuffy Mclnnis.
Athletics' first baseman has been a
paragon for consistent hitting. Season
in and season out he has batted above
the .300 mark, always around the same
figures. He batted .301 in 1910, .321 In
1011. .321 In 1912, .321 in 1913. .314 In
1914 and .314 in 1915 a remarkable
record for a player who will be onlv

This year Stuffy has been in a fearful

"SLIDING GLOVE" IS NOT NEW
Chick Gandll Causes Sensation In
Using Mitt to Protect Hand Roy
Thomas Also Wore One.
Chick Gandll created a sensation In
Cleveland recently by using a "slid
lng glove." Cleveland writers declare
that such a thing1 as a "sliding glove"
was never seen at a ball game In that
city before. Gandll has a badly
bruised hand, and he covered It with
a well-padded glove for protection in
case he was called upon to slide.
A "sliding glove" may be a novelty
nowadays, although It would not be a
new sight When Roy Thomas Dlaved
with the Phillies he wore a "sliding
clove which not only covered his
hand, but also covered his arm. even
beyond the elbow.

Fought Furiously.
A young officer, who was at Mnntn
Llsser only a few days ago, gave me
a graphic account of these Dosltions.
The retreating battle had been fought
furiously, almost night and day, for 40
days. The enemy was already gaining
glimpses over the mountain passes of
the smiling plains of Vicenza below.
The Italian soldiers were fiehtinc
with their backs to a lone line of nrec-
Iplces, over which the furious and in
cessant onslaught of the desperate en
emy, whose numbers seemed Inex
haustible, threatened to hurl them.
Suddenly there came a feeling of re
lief. Sledge-hammer blows were being
dealt to the Austrlans on the extreme
right and left wings. The enemy's
attack in the center Instantly became
less resolute, and the Itnllan troops,
who had hitherto been retreatine.
found to their joy that they were
backed by huge lines of Impregnable
defenses, prepared during those 40
days, and masses of troops and artil
lery were eager to come forward and
take the places of the brave men who
nau so long defended the danger-line.
Hours passed In eager expectation.
The last scene in the preparation was
the arrival of the guns. They were
towed up the mule paths; dragged up
by sheer work of hand' to seemingly
inaccessible summits. Ammunition
trains stood thickly behind, waiting to
unload.
Swarm Ud Mountain.
Thousands upon thousands of troops
were swarming up the mountain
Slopes. New roads sprung Into exist
ence where none had been before.
Batteries made their appearance where
only eagles had built their nests, and
the last desperate skirmish on Monte
Lemerle and Magnoboschl had scarcely
subsided when hundreds of Italian
guns opened fire with an Infernal
chorus.
Shells flew thick and heavy from the
lines between Monte Pau and Monte
Stremel, across the valley of Aslago,
and word came that the Austrlans
were yielding and falling back.
The ItaMan infantry immediately
took up the pursuit They rushed
down the mountain slopes, raising
their war cry of "Savoy," and occupied

case, however, and Cnpt. Hugh L.

he weighed a monster tunn flsh which
tipped the scales at 695 pounds.

The big fish was caueht In a fisher

of Black Island and had to be speared
before being prepared for shipment to
New York. Meanwhile the fisherman
is trying to figure out whether the
price of the monster will pay to repair
his nets,

WlUo.ughby, "I believe that there never
