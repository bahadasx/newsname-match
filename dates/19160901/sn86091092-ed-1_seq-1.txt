THE CALDW ELL TRIBUNE, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1916.
WEEKLY, $..'.00 FER YEAR
mue SCHOOLS Will
STAB! MONDAY.
SEITEÂ« II
The date for the opening of the
public schools of Caldwell has been
set for Monday, September 11th All
children who are 6 years of age at
that time, are eligible to enter the
beginning class. Others who will be
6 on or before November 1st will be
(accommodated, as far as possible.
For all others there will be a begin
ning class organized in January
Enrollment at the High School will
-begin promptly at 8:15 on Monday
morning the 11th, and will continue
throughout the day. Students not en
rolling on this date will be somewhat
retarded in their work in starting the
year, as the first meeting of classes
will occur on Tuesday morning. Those
who find it impossible to come on
Monday morning will be accom
modated on the Saturday morning
preceding.
The opening session of the grades
will commence promptly at 9 o'clock.
All pupils are requested to bring with
the in their report cards, which were
issued at the close of last year, which
should be presented to the teacher in
charge of the grade of which they ex
pect to become a member. Pupils
who are coming from the Ward build
ings to the High School should bring
with them their report cards, which
should be presented to the principal
of the High School upon enrollment.
Parents are urged to come with
students who are entering High
School for the first time, and to con
fer with the members of the faculty
Concerning the -work which would
seem most advisable. Many times
pupils take up work for which they
are entirely umsuited, and they are
often led by various influences to
enroll in classes which they find later
to be of little benefit to them. By
careful investigation of the work, on
the part of the parents, the students
may be guided into work which may
be beneficial to them, and which will
secure the results which are being
sought.
Teachers Arriving This Week.
The members of the teachers' corps
of the public schools are beginning
to arrive, and it is expected that they
will all be here by Monday, Septem
ber the 4th, in order that they may
be in attendance at the Institute at
Boise. The opening session of the
Institute occurs on Monday evening,
September 5th, when Dr. Stockton
Axson, of Princton University, who
took last year's Institute literally by
storm, will deliver one of his series
of lectures on English and Literature
appreciation. It witl be remembered
that Dr. Axson gave some very inter,
esting lectures on Shakespearian ap
preciation last year, and everyone who
heard him felt that to hear him alone
was well worth the attending of the
Institute.
All day Tuesday the offices of the
Institute will be kept open at the
fligh School building in Boise for
the purpose of giving visiting teachers
desired information. If they have not
secured room and board before ar
riving in the city, they should go to
the office in the High School build
ing where lists of places offering ac
commodation will be kept.
The first general teachers meeting
of the year will be held at the High
School building on Saturday after
noon, September 9th, at 3 o'clock. All
teachers are expected to attend this
meeting, as many important announce
ments governing the work of the
opening year will be made at this
time.
High School Students Seek Employ,
ment.
Inquiries have come from a number
of students Who expect to enter High
School this year for work, which will
be of assistance to them in paying
their expenses. A number of girls

assisting with household duties. Those
who arc interested in securing student
help may get in touch with the appli
cants by communicating with the Sup

SPLENDID PEACH CROP IN
SUNNY SLOPE DISTRICT
Potatoes Are Being Shipped Out at
Rate of 80 Cars a Week.
We have plenty of peaches on
Sunny Slope," was the statement
made by Mr. O, W. Collins Tuesday.
The crop is just as large as usual and
the yield is normal. My orchard will
produce between 15 and 20 tons and
there are a number of other orchards
bearing heavily this year," Mr. Col
lins continued.
Mr. Collins stated that 80 carloads
of potatoes were shipped from sta
tions along the line of the Caldwell
Traction company last week. The
yield has been heavy. Many instances
arc cited where farmers cleared from
$125.00 to $200.00 per acre on their
potatoes. Corn is also produced in
that section of Deer Flat. There are
scores of farms where the corn crop
will run from 65 to 75 bushels to the
acre.
Well Pleased With Country.
Mr. Collins came to Idaho a few
years ago from Missouri. He bought
his farm at Sunny Slope without
seeing it but is mighty well pleased
with the purchase. Mr. Collins is
convinced that this section of Idaho,
and particularly Sunny Slope, is the
greatest country in the world for any
and all kinds of farming.
HAWLEY RETAINED AS
COUNSEL FOR SETTLERS
Boise Farmers Will Fight Reclama
tion Service If Forced to Do So.
Saturday the committee of the board
of directors appointed to consult
counsel in regard to the rights of the
settlers under the Boise Reclamation
Project, recommended to the Board of
Directors of the Boise Water Users'
association that Mr. James H. Hawley
be retained as counsel. The Board of
Directors acted on the recommenda
tion of the committee and authorized
the retention of Mr. Hawley. A fee
of $750.00 was ordered paid Mr. Haw
ley as a retainer.
The committee which after inves
tigation decided that counsel should
be employed consisted of President
Keim and Directors L. J. McGee, W.
E. Wood and A. C. Johnson.
Prepared to Fight.
The action of the Board of Direc
tors in employing Mr. Hawley was
unanimous. All of the directors, and
especially President Keim and the
committee, are awake to the necessity
of safeguarding the interests cf the
settlers on the Boise Project. They
propose to see to it that nothing is
lost by default.
Mr. Hawley will immediately start
to look into the case of the settlers.
Every one who has looked into the
matter is convinced that a consider
able reduction from the book cost of
the Boise Project can be secured by
intelligent action.

Ladies to Compete Against Maxey
and Shaw in School Board Race.
At a meeting held at the Lincoln
building last Tuesday afternoon, the
ladies of the City Circle of the Parent
Teachers' association placed two of
their members in the running against
Messrs. E. L. Shaw and W. S. Maxey
for (lirectors of the Board of Educa
tion, Mrs. Robert Farrar and Mrs. J.
J. Allison being the nominees. The
election which is to be held next Tues

interesting one.
Rumors to the effect that Mr.
Maxey and Mr. Shaw were not going
to run for office again this year have
been emphatically denied by both can
didates.
The election of officers for the city
circle was also held at this meeting
of the association, Mrs. R. S. Madden
being chosen for president and Mrs.
F. A. Noble, secretary and treasurer.
It was decided to organize a city
executive committee, to be made up of
two members chosen from each cir

with the power to transact the husi
ness of the city circle.

AN EXPERT ON POTATOES
VISITS THE DEER
FLAT BELT
The Deer Flat potato belt is at
tracting the attention of the people of
the whole country. The quality and
quantity of potatoes raised is bring,
ing inquiries by letter and by person
from dealers in potatoes, investors
and home seekers. Every day local
people are receiving letters of inquiry
from friends and acquaintances in
other states.
The local people are also investing
in Deer Flat lands. During the past
seven days seven tracts of land, the
smallest being 40 acres, were sold to
local people. A considerable advance
in lands in the Deer Flat country is
sure to take place within the next few
months. The yields command a much
arger price than the lands are bring
ing.
Potato Experts Here.
Prof. E. P. Taylor, Field Horticul
turist of the Extension Department of
the University of Idaho, was in Cald
well Monday. Prof. Taylor severed
his connections with the University
September 1st. He goes from Idaho
to the Agricultural College of Utmh.
Monday Prof. Taylor, E. R. Bennett
the new P'ield Horticulturist, aind
Plant Pattelogist, Miss M. A. Willis,
all of the State University visited the
potato belt of Deer Flat. They were
highly pleased with the conditions as
they found them.
Prof. Taylor has given out the fol
lowing signed statement of conditions
as he found them and the impressions
he gained. Coming from such a man
they cannot be questioned. The state
ment follows:
Comparing Potato Notes.
I have just returned from a trip of
inspection of the potato sections out
of Caldwell including Deer Flat,
Wilder and Greenleaf and am enthus
iastic over the possibilities of this in
dustry for this section.
Of course I saw some record crops
of alfalfa, clover, corn and grain, but
those potato fields certainly looked
good to me.
Mr. Nichols and County Agricultur
al Agent McCall took a party of state
potato specialists and enthusiasts in.
eluding Field Horticulturist K. R.
Bennett and Plant Pathologist Miss
M. A. Willis of the University oi Ida
ho, out to the heart of the Deer Flat
potato district where 30 farmers amd
potato buyers met at the special seed
plot, where fancy potato seed is being
grown, to compare potato notes and
look over the fine crop. Almost an
equal number met at the Frosig field
at Wilder.
It was a sight to see the splendid
setting of perfect tubers upon the
Idaho Rurals, nothing unusual to find
from 15 to 20 Idaho Rurals of market
For most part the fields are yield
ing well and the prices are good.
Some of the old potato mem of the
section are buying more land to ex
tend their potato acreage and numer
ous new settlers are making land pur
chases.
The best thing about it is that the
land is changing hands at so low a
figure that when one considers the
soil, climate, abundance and cheapness
of water and the shipping facilities,
that it looks to me as though they
could not help making good.
Early Season Great Advantage.
They have a season which permits
the shipping of matured Idaho Rurals
at least two weeks ahead of the most
of the state which gives the growers
a chance at the high early prices.
I believe that the growers south of
Caldwell over along the Snake river
in the sandy sioSl should go into an
early potato variety like the Irish
Cobbler or Early Ohio, but the bulk
of planting in Deer Flat and Wilder
should be the "good old Idaho R irai"
with only a light acreageâperhaps
one-third of the crop tio Netted Gem
for late potatoes.
On account of getting onto the mar>
ket early the bulk of the crop will be
sold at digging time if prices are
good, but growers should have more
suitable cellars to hold them in when
it is desirable.
I fully believe that the natural ad
vantages surrounding the district
would justify the extension of the
potato acreage fully tan times what it
is at the present.

"dividends on watered stock." as j

than those received by Ambassador
Penfield at Vienna, who gave $10 000, |
but not so large as those of Ambassa- |

the element of luck entered very
largely.

THE PRIMARY ELECTION
WILL BE HELD
TUESDAY
j French
The^ primary election will be held
Tuesday next. At that time the two
political parties will elect their can
didates. It is clearly the duty of every
citizen to vote at the primary election.
The power to nominate the state and
county ticket has been placed in the
hands of the electorate and no mem
ber should neglect his duty. The
minor political parties will nominate
their tickets at conventions of the
party.
In addition to placing in nomina
tion the candidates of the political
party to which he belongs the voter
will also elect two candidates for jus
tice of the Supreme Court. The ju
diciary has been taken out of politics,
so we are told, and the political affil
iations for justice of the Supretm*
Court should not be considered.
Three Men in Field.
There are three candidates in the
field for the nomination of justice of
the Supreme Court. They are Judge
John C. Rice, of Caldwell; Judge Rob
ert N. Dunn, of Coeur d'Alene; and
Mr. Justice I. N. Sullivan who is a
candidate to succeed himself. Not
that it makes any difference but as an
item of interest we might say that Mr.
Rice is a Democrat and Judge Dunn
and Justice Sullivan are Republicans.
The court, as at present constituted,
consists of one Democrat, Mr. Justice
Morgan, and two Republicans, Mr.
Justice Budge and Mr. Justice Sulli
van. At the primary election the
voter votes for two of the three can
didates. The justice will be elected
at the general election in November.
Democratic Politics.
The Democrats are not greatly in
terested in the primary election. For
the state offices and for most of the
county offices there is only one can
didate for each office. The candi
datures were quietly burked as they
were born leaving the membership of
the party free and untrammeled at the
primary election.
In Canyon county Mr. H. A. Grif
fiths and Mr. M. H. Eustace are can
didates for the Democratic nomination
for prosecuting attorney. Not know
ing much of Democratic politics it
would be useless for The Tribune to
try to pick the winner. We are of the
opinion that Mr. Griffiths has a little
edge on Mr. Eustace.
Mr. G. T. Moore of Nampa is con
testing with Mr. C. Q. Adams for the
Democratic nomination for county
aommissioner in the first district. We
feel that Mr. Adams will be the nomi
nee of his party.
The Democrats have two candidates
for state senator. They are W. P.
O'Conner of Nampa and Representa
tive Ingard of Payette. It makes no
difference to The Tribune who is
led to the slaughter. We predict the
nomination of Mr. Ingard.
Republican Candidates.
Either there are more Republicans
who want office, or else the chances
of election is considered better in the
Republican party. There are two or
more candidates for nearly every state
and county office. When it comes to
picking winners on the Republican
ticket The Tribune is hopeless.
The candidates for the different
offices are a high class of men in
every respect as far as we know them.
We do not believe that a serious mis
take will be made whoever is nomi
nated. Undoubtedly some candidates
would make better officers than others
but we cannot pick them out.
The candidates in the field arc:
State Ticket.
GovernorâGeorge E. Crutn of
Lewiston; D. W. Davis of American
Falls; Captain E. G. Davis of Boise;
Herman H. Taylor of Sandpoint.
Secretary of StateâGeorge R. Bar
ker of Sandpoint; Erv Johnson of
Boise; Chancy Walace of Nez Perce.
State AuditorâGeorge W. Lewis of
Boise; W. S. Parkhurst of Richfield;
Melvin J. Barrows of Hazclton.
TreasurerâJohn W. Eagleson of
Boise; Fred E. Fisk of Parma.
Superintendent of Schoolsâ-Cather
ine T. Bryden of Moscow; Ethel Red
dield of Lewiston.
Attorney GenerelâCarlton Fox of
Wallace; M. J. Sweeley of Twin Falls;
Charles A. Sunderlin of Buhl.
Inspector of Mines-âRobert N. Bell
of the state of Idaho.
Congressional Timber.
It is easy to pick the winners for
the nomination for representative in
congress. There are four candidates
in the field. The winners will be
Congressman Addison T. Smith and
former Congressman Burton L.
Mr. E. Elliott has not made
! much headway in his campaign.

ALEXANDERSON RESIDENT
OF IDAHO 11 YEARS
Centerpoint Farmer Will Celebrate
By Becoming Candidate for
Commissioner.
A. P. Alexanderson, the well known
Centerpoint farmer, has been a resi
dent of Idaho 11 years. He came to
the Boise valley 11 years ago from
California. He purchased 40 acrcs on
Pleasant Ride for $50.00 per acre. He
held this tract two years and sold it
for $100.00 per acre, and at tile same
time purchased his Centerpoint farm.
Mr. Alexanderson has worked hard
and intelligently since locating in the
Boise valley and has prospered ac
cordingly. This year he is celebrating
the anniversary of his landing in Ida
ho by becoming a candidate for the
Republican nomination for county
commissioner. He will secure the
nation without fail.
WILDER NATIONAL BANK
ORGANIZED ON AUGUST 26
Strong Men Back of New Canyon
County Financial Institution.
( Nampa Leader-Herald.)
A banking institution to be known
as the First National Bank of Wilder,
was organized Saturday, August 26,
in which Nampa men are heavy stock
holders and have been named as the
executive officers. The institution is
capitalized at $25,000.00, fully paid up,
and the men back of it represent a fi
nancial responsibility of several times
that amount.
The officers named were John Pi
pher, president; James I. Meredith,
vice president, and R. W. Pipher,
treasurer.
Mr. John Pipher has been the mov
ing spirit in the organization of the
bank and is a man thoroughly versed
in the banking business. For more
than twenty years he was successfully
engaged in the banking business m
Iowa, and in this undertaking his as
sociates are old Iowa neighbors, who
knew his manner of doing business
there.
The Wilder section is one of the
very best in Idaho and is developing
rapidly. That it will be a very rich
country in a few years is a certainty
and the new bank is certain to be one
of the important factors in such de
velopment.
The board of directors are, John
Pipher, Nampa; James I. Meredith,
Rupert; Frank M. Brown, Wilder; E.
C. Bradley, Wilder, and G. B. Oben,
dorf of Wilder.

It is stated that some sportsmen feel

Congressman Addison T. Smith is

ment im'der the appropriation for
roads in the national forest in Idaho
We observe that Smith has been a
great champion for federal aid in the
onstruction of good rads. In his
speech befre cngress n this question
lie pointed out that the appropriation
of the federal government in public
lands to aid in the construction of
-Iilroads has been $1.000,000,000; for
ivers and harbors. $600.000,000; for
>nblic buildings $200.000.000, and for
the Panma Canal $400.000,000, and he
states that that "there is every reason
why the people of this country should
demand that the government proceed
with the construction of good roads
in every section of the Union for the
benefit of the peoole of all the states."
The above is taken from the Con

Addison Smith is certainly doing

PATCH CANNOT HOLD A
CIVIL AND MILITARY
COMMISSION TOO
Captain I,. V. Patch, who is a can
date for the Republican nomination
lor lieutenant governor, in a telegram
to Mr. Burt Venable of Payette, states
that iin case of his election he will get
a ,60 day leave of absence from the
militia and serve as lieutenant gov
ernor. Captain Patch is trying to give
the impression that he can retain his
position in the army and serve as
lieutenant governor too.
Captain Patch has given no intima
tion that he would resign as an officer
of the army. He must resign his com
mission in the army or refuse to serve
lieutenant governor. The law gov
erning this point is plain and explicit
and it is a matter of surprise that Cap
tain Patch has not looked into the law
more carefully.
In order that the reader may know
we quote the section of the law ap.
pertaining to this particular point;
Accepting or Holding Civil Office.
Section 1222, Vol. 7, Federal Stat
ues Annotated, page 1009, reads:
"No officer of the army on the
active list shall hold any civil office
whether by election or appointment,
and every suc-h officer who accepts
or exercises the functions of a civil
office shall thereby cease to be an
officer of the army and his commis
sion shall be thereby vacated."
IDAHO STATE FAIR
WILL BE HUMMER
Under the direction of Colonel
Amos J. Miller, general manager, the
1916 Idaho State fair to be held in
Caldwell the week beginning October
2 will be the most successful in the
history of the organization. From
present indications every department
will be crowded with choice exhibits
of Idaho's varied resources.
As in previous expositions the live
stock show will be one of the leading
ittractions and will demonstrate to
visitors the unlimited possibilities of
southern Idaho as a livestock section.
In the horticultural and agricultural
departments care will be taken to dis
play exhibits properly and the judging
will be done by recognized authori
ties.
The premiums offered by the asso
ciation this year total more than
$10,000, providing handsome awards
for all of the state's varied products.
The lists are being mailed from the
office of the general manager and
may be had by interested parties upon
application.
Realizing the importance of the an
nual show to the livestock industry of
the west, fair officials have co
operated with officers of the leading
national livestock associations in
maintaining, if .not eclipsing, the high
standard of previous years. In the
swine department the events of im
portance to growers will be the state
futurity shows of the National Duroc.
Tersey and Poland-China associations.
Cash prizes aggregating more than
$1,100 are offered by the national as
sociation to successful exhibitors in
the futurity shows. In addition to the
large cash prizes medals and ribbons
will be awarded. The shows will be
conducted under the direct supervis
ion of the national associations and
are held onljy at recognized stajje
'"airs. Judges of national repm vtion
will be selected to officiate a: the
Idaho futurities.
Other departments in the livestock
section will vie with the swine grow
ers for supremacy. George Murray,
general superintendent of the live
stock show is confident that the
showing of cattle, horses, mules anc!
sheep will be the most qomplete in the
history of the association. Entries
have been received from widely sep
arated sections and the animals shown
will be representative of the state.
With the bumper crops being har
vested by Idaho farmers the agricul
tural hall will prove a revelation to
visitors. The display of grains,
grasses, seeds and vegetables will tax
the capacity of the large building and
will include exhibits from a large
number of southern Idaho counties.
An innovation introduced by Man
ager Miller which will be of interest
to everyone attending the fair is the
automobile show. A large tent will be
raisÃ©d to house the exhibits which
will include all well known passenger
cars and tractors. Wednesday has
been designated "Automobile Day"
with an automobile parade and dem
onstrations featuring the program.
Under the direction of J. S. Har
rington and committee on amusment
proferame replete with novelty fea
tures and exciting speed events is
being arranged. Assurances hav" been
received that some of the fastest har.
.ness horses in the west will compete.
In addition to the racing card Chair
man Harrington is arranging for high
class open air vaudeville attractions
which will be presented daily at the
grounds.
The downtown amusements will b"
given under the direction of the
amusement committee of the Com
mercial Club, assuring a program of
merit for the entire week. The com
mittee met Wednesday afternoon an 1
adopted tentative plans for a w"ek of
jollification for Caldwell visitors
Chairman Zeh, will appoint the var
ious sub-committees within the next
few davs and active Work for .the
celebration will be in full swing.
