TRAINMEN ASK FOR
AN EIGHT-HOUR DAY
The trainmen contend that, in spite
of increases in railway pay, the labor
cost of the transportation companies
have constantly tended downward.
What they mean is that the rail
roads have been getting more and
more labor out of the trainmen. This
has been done by lengthening pas
senger trains without, at the same
time, putting on additional employes.
Heavier and heavier freight trains
have been sent over the divisions.
Some of these trains have been so
long that the locomotives were able
to pull them only at a slow speed.
Except where legislation has forced it,
the train crews have remained un
changed. Thus—the trainmen say—
the increased labor productivity has
played an important part in increas
ing railroad earnings. They insist
they should have a larger share of
the increment and so demand an eight
hour day without decrease in pay.
One of the arguments for scientific
management has been that it would
increase the benefits of labor, give it
bigber pay, lower the working day.

What the railroads have done in re
cent years has been to apply scien
tific management to their business so
tar as they could do so.
Aside from the merits of the rail
way dispute, it must be borne in mind
that the whole proposition of scien
tific management is bound to fail
unless increased profits derived from
the system are divided, in amounts
small or large, with labor. The in
creased production under the scheme
is greatly to be desired by the nation.
But it is also highly desirable that
the benefits so obtained shall not be
concentrated in a few hands, but dis
tributed widely throughout the coun
try.— Toledo( Ohio) Blade, April 3,
1916.

The Labor Journal
"LET'S SIT IN
THE SUN"
Weekly Letter From President
E. P. Marsh of the State
Federation
I was searching my mind the other j
day for a theme for this article that
Bro. Hughes asked me to contribute
to the Labor Day issue of the Labor j
Journal and 1 was stuck. My mind
was taking a vacation and I couldn't
"make the wheels in my head track."
I turned to one of the boys in the of-1
fice and I said to him: "Hughes j
wants me to write an article for his |
Labor Day issue and, to save my life,
I can't think of anything that I
haven't written over and over again
until it is a "chestnut." Do you know
what he said? "Write something about
the grouchy union man who makes you
think of a funeral every time he
opens his yap." Which set me to
thinking. I wonder if it wouldn't be
a good idea if we sat in the sun a
little more and talked about our vic
tories and our blessings. Surely, the
labor union movement isn't all somber
ness and tragedy and black despair.
Trades unionism has brought sun
shine and hope into many a home, re
newed ambition in the breast of many
a man who had become wearied of
the ceaseless struggle of life, left its
lasting imprint on every phase of
existence.
Think of the Good Things
When we get in the doldrums be
cause of some lost battle the best
antidote is to cast up accounts on the
other side of the book and think of
the splendid things labor has ac
complished. Think of the kiddies you
took out of the mines and factories
and put in school or turned them
loose on the playgrounds. If it be
true that we who are approaching the
meridian of life or are going down the
farther side of the slope toward the
shadows, live again in the hearts of
the young, we ought to be glad, glad
that trades unionism gave to America
her free school system and then set
its hand to the task of giving to every
American child an opportunity to ac
quire a free education.
And what a change has come over
public sentiment in the past few
years. Time was when organized
labor was just tolerated, it had no
standing in "good society." Its meet
ing place was over a saloon, the bar
room its club, itc committee room, its
public forum. Today it is a recog
nized moral force in every community.
Those chosen to act as its spokesman
find eager auditors in women's clubs,
churches, civic societies, wherever
people gather to discuss the affairs of
life.
The public is coming to recognize
that there is something really con
structive, something broad underly
ing the principles of trade unionism.
Not in fifty years has there been such
a liberal education afforded the public
as to the "why" of trade unionism as
was afforded by the national investiga
tion by the Federal Commission on
Industrial Relations. That report has
been aptly termed the "text book of
labor" and is destined to do a splendid
work in setting people to thinking
about fundamentals in our industrial
problem.
A Great Humanitarian Work
A short time ago I attended the
state convention of the State Anti-
Tuberculosis Society, a body of splen
did men and women who are fighting
unselfishly, without hope of monetary
award or public acclaim, the deadliest
enemy the worker has. I was privi
leged to address that gathering upon
"Tuberculosis and the Workingman."
I took the ground that the problem
was an economic and social problem
and told that gathering that they could
not hope to combat tuberculosis unless
they attacked the industrial system
that was responsible for slums, long
hours, low wages, weakened physical
j vitality, all the environments that in
vited disease. And the response I got
I from that gathering! One doctor got
up and in a voice vibrating with feel
ing, told of his quarter century ex
j perience with the tubercular poor. "It
is the tragedy of the century," said
, he, "that the poor must die like flies
from this awful disease, because they
have no chance for themselves. A

CHARGES ARE
SUSTAINED
Every Charge Against U. S.
Steel Corporation Is Upheld
by Court
I Washington, I). C. —Every charge
brought against the United states
Steel Corporation by the striking iron
miners of Northern Minnesota is sus
tained in a report just submitted to
Governor Burnquist by his own state
labor commissioner.
Miners have been exploited by the
contract system, cheated, oppressed,
forced to give bribes to their mine
captains arrested without warrants,
given unfair trials, and subjected to
"serious injustices" at the hands of
the mine guards and police. This is
the substance of the findings.
Mine guards employed by the com
pany, deputized by Sheriff Meining
without investigation, and supported
by Governor Burnfuist, are to blame
for .all disorder. The report says;
"We are not entirely in sympathy
with the belief that vigorous measures
were necessary to maintain peace and
safety in this strike. We are entirely
satisfied that the mine guards have
exceeded their legal rights and duties
and invaded the citizenship rights of
the strikers; that such violence as has
occurred has been more chargeable
to the mine guards and police than to
the strikers; and that the public po
lice departments have entirely ex
ceeded the needs of the situation, and
have perpetrated serious injustice
upon the strikers.
"Numerous cases of arrest without
warrant, and unfair trials in the jus
tices' courts were brought to our at
tention. We will not go into these
cases in detail, as the federal men
have promised a thorough investiga
tion but we are seriously impressed
that the mine guards should have
been compelled to remain on mine
property or disarm when they left it.
"Every shooting affray that has oc
curred on the range has occurred on
public property. In no case have the
so-called riots occurred on or even
near company property.
"The parades of the miners have
been peaceful, the public police have
had no trouble in maintaining order,
and if the private mine guards had
been compelled to remain on the com
pany property we do not believe that
there would ever have been any
bloodshed on the range."
Governor Hurnquist, whose tele
gram to Sheriff Meining was generally
accepted as an order to go the limit
In breaking the strike, is now on the
defensive. In the face of reports from
the Committee on Industrial Relations
and from his own state labor depart
ment, he can no longer escape a
reckoning for the part he has played
in aiding the Steel Corporation to
maintain industrial tyranny. After
reading the report of his own state
labor department he issued a state
ment, saying:
"As an official 1 am interested only
in the enforcement of the law. Per-
sonally I have had four men up there
to investigate conditions, and none of
the four has ever reported to me any
undue violence on the part of of
ficials."

were carefully selected.

REPUDIATES RAILROAD PUBLICITY ARTICLE
CHAIRMAN OF U. S. COMMITTEE ON INDUSTRIAL R
LATIONS BRANDS MAGAZINE WRITER AS ATTEMPTING
TO DECEIVE THE PUBLIC
An example of the railroad's bare
faced attempts to mislead the public
is an article signed by "Luke Grant,
Special Agent, United States Indus
trial Commission," which appeared in
Chamberlain's Magazine for February,
lJtlti, entitled "Wages and Hours of
Railroad Employes." This article has
been reprinted in circular form and is
now being circulated by the railroad
companies.
The following statement, signed by
Frank P, Walsh, chairman, Committee
on Industrial Relations, is a perfect
expose of the cheap and deceitful
methods deliberately being used in an
attempt to discredit the railroad em-
ployes in their fair and reasonable
demand for an eight-hour day:
Mr. Walsh's Statement to the Public
Washington D. C, Feb. 16, 1916.
Charging the conference committee
of managers of the railroads of the
United States with a deliberate at
tempt to deceive the public, Frank P,
Walsh today issued a statement re
pudiating and denouncing the use of
the name of the United States Com
mission on Industrial Relations in
connection with the distribution of a
pamphlet attacking the eight-hour
movement of the railroad brother
hoods.
The pamphlet is entitled "Wages
and Hours of Railroad Employes," and
is by Luke Grant, who is designated
on the cover, and again on the title
page as "Special Agent for the United
State Industrial Commission."
After characterizing Grant's discus
sion of the eight-hour movement of
the brotherhoods as a "skillful piece
of special pleading, in which facts are
distorted, for the evident purpose of
prejudicing the public against the
men," Mr. Walsh says:
"Grant is not an agent of the In
dustrial Commission and has not been
since last July. The commission, as
was well known to the railroad man
agers when they put out this pam
phlet expired by statutory limitation
in August, and their use of this desig
nation of Grant is a deliberate and
willful attempt to deceive the public
and give the prestige of this commis
sion to a document that was not en
titled to it and that without it would
carry no weight.
The commission made no investiga
tion whatever into conditions of em
ployment in the train service of the
railroads, and whatever information
Mr. Grant possessed on the subject
must have been handed to him by the
railroads or obtained from other
sources. His statement sounds sus- 1
piciously like an echo of that issued
by the railroads themselves.
Mr. Grant since he left the employ
of the commission, has been employed
by the Tariff Commission League, and
in that employmenf*he has attempted
to capitalize his standing with or
ganized labor, acquired in past years
as an active trade unionist. Grant's
attack on the railroad brotherhoods
shows him in his true character as a
hostile critic of the labor movement
and a champion of those interests
that are always ready to reward men
of his type.
This dishonest use of the name of
the commission is not the first evi
dence that the railroads are deter
mined to sacrifice the truth in their
campaign to turn the public against
the men who operate the trains, and
to defeat the movement to relieve
them from excessively long hours of
labor.
In their own names, the railroad
managers have issued a statement
whcih, for deliberate and shameless
misrepresentation of the facts, has
never been surpassed. This state
ment asserts flatly and without quali-
the G. O. P., met to discuss the ad
visability of putting up a complete
ticket and preserve their party
identity. \Mhether this was a wise
move or not doesn't concern me just
now. 1 am trying to show how modern
thought is moving. These people had
some of you conservative union fel
lows tied to the mast when it came to
declaring themselves upon what they

iication that the mm were demanding
large increases In pay. Not until two
thirds of a column has been occupied
by these statements did the author in
cidentally mention the fact that the
men are proposing, not higher wages,
but relief from ten, twelve, fourteen
and sixteen hour workdays, and this
in the freight service only."
"Not a cent of additional pay," Mr.
Walsh continues, "is demanded by the
men except for time in excess of eight
hours, and after eight hours the men
ask time-and-one-half for overtime
only when the speed of the train
averages less than 12% miles an
hour.
The successful mendacity of the
railroad managers is shown in the
headlines that were placed above this
statement in good faith by newspaper
editors who wished to convey the sub
stance of the statement. These head
lines conveyed the impression uni
versally that the men were demand
ing large increases in wages.
Further to prejudice the men's case
and prevent a fair public hearing, the
railroad managers, in their statement
to the public, confused the eight-hour
day demand with the suggestion of
higher freight rates, or a reduction in
interest and dividend payment.
The only question now at issue is
whether or not the eight-hour day,
universally recognized as the longest
period of labor that should be re
quired, should be enjoyed by the men
who are responsible for the safety of
lives and property on American rail
roads.
To raise the question of freight
rates or dividend payments in this
connection is as far beside the point
as it would be to raise the question of
whether or not the railroad presidents
and managers should be put in jail for
stealing billions of dollars of public
lands in the West; for wrecking rail
road after railroad by the issuing of
worthless stocks and bonds; for vot
ing huge commissions and secret
rake-offs to favored bankers and
brokers; for bribing public officials
and debauching legislatures; or for
conspiring with great industrial cor
porations to crush competition, and to
build up monopolies for the robbing of
the people.
Still further to confuse the issue.
the railroads have started a discussion
regarding the advisability of a govern
ment wage board to fix wages for
railroad employes It such a plan
were to be initiated by congress and
I the federal government, it would mean
that congress is attempting to check
an advance in pay for wage earners
when it attempts no such thing for
those classes of exploiters and profit
takers who take infinitely heavier toll
from the communit) for no useful
service whatsoever. The federal gov
ernment has not yet attempted to
regulate the issuing of railroad se
curities, and with government consent
lhe roads have been robbed of hun
dreds of millions through the issuing
of watered stocks and bonds.
Nor should the question of govern
ment ownership be raised in this con
nection. Government ownership of
railroads is as sure to come as there
f is sure to be a more equitable distribu
• tion of wealth and freedom and justice
- for wage earners. But these lines of
' progress must he kept separate and
.distinct. Government ownership is
1 1 sound and right, but it will not of
11 itself solve the question of justice to
t the wage earners. In Washington to
day the government is paying street
cleaners $1.25 a day, for which they
must buy uniforms and pay for their
cleaning. Kven under government
ownership, the employes must have
the right to organize and act together,
and even to strike."
