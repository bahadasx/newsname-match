Timms, Daring Bird Man, Wii. J '
form Death Defying Stunts Daily.
Exhibits Coming in East.
Next Thursday is the opening day
of the Valley County Fair and from
all indications there will be more ex- :
hibits of farm products on display this
year than was ever known before. The
fact that the harvest is well advanc-1
ed and that many of the farmers have
already threshed out their grains in- j
dicate that the grain exhibit will be j
most extensive and the quality will
be of the best.
The prizes offered this year exceed
those of previous years by many dol
lars and amount to nearly Two Thous
and dollars. This is one of the in
centives for bringing in a very large
variety of the products and many
farmers are going to compete in the
various departments more than they
have done heretofore. Wheat and
corn are the favorites in the special
prizes offered by the business men of,
Glasgow and they will serve to make |
it worth the time required to prepare
the exhibit and bring it to the fair.
The livestock exhibit will be great- j
ly increased this year. One of the
especially attractive exhibits this
year will be the herds of dairy
stock to be shown. This exhibit will
compete for a Fifty Dollar Prize di
vided into three premiums and already
there are four entries with the pos
sibility of several more entering be
fore the first day of the fair. The
exhibit of hogs promises to be one
1
:
!
;
of great interest as many farmers
. . .. -
have indicated their intentions ot.
, . , , . I, ,
showing their porkers and stalls have
been reserved for a large number.
In addition to the cattle and hogs
there are many entries of horses both
in the registered and grade classes.
There has been a great increase in
high grade live stock in the county
during the past year and this means
,. u il i wu !
that a bigger show will be seen at the,
fair than is usual at a county fair.!
Besides the agricultural and live
stock exhibits the free attractions at
the fair are such as to make it par
ticularly attractive. The big event of
the free attractions will be youn
Timms who will appear for the first
time in Montana in his 100 horse,
power Tiactoi biplane doing all the
latest and most daring stunts
air. He will fly up side down, loop
the loop, do the spiral dip and the
death drop, besides many other novel
Partial State Returns
Give Pray Heavy Lead
Partial returns from twenty-two !
.. . , , it , . „
counties, received at Helena up to
a late hour last night make
it certain that Charles N. Pray
will be the Republican candidate for
senator, Miss Rankin and either Farr
or Linderman for Congress, and F. J.
Edwards for governor. Partial re
turns from eight counties give Annin
a big lead for the lieutenant governor
ship. Boyle for railroad commissioner,
and Trumper for state superintendent;
Rhoades has a fair lead for the audit
orship, and Brown is leading for at
torney general, Hart for treasurer,
and Hazelbaker for secretary of state,
but additional returns may displace
Brown for Ford, Hedrick for Hart and
possibly Stewart for Hazelbaker. ■
Charles Pray got the biggest vote I
of any Republican candidate and is
leading J. E. Edwards for the senator
ship by nearly 5,000. Miss Rankin is
in second place and is leading Farr by
nearly 4,000 votes, with Linderman
third and a good chance to gain when
the northern Montana vote comes in.
Only two places are in doubt on
the Democratic ticket—whether Cutts
or Mitchell will win the second place
on the congressional ticket and whe
ther Superintendent Davee or Miss
O'Donnell will be nominated for state
superintendent.
Senator Myers has been renominated
for senator, Governor Stewart as a
candidate to succeed himself, Mc-i
and dangerous stunts. His recommen
dations are of the very best and his
daily flights are an assured fact. Then
there is Rollo the Limit. This attrac-1
tion has drawn big at all the state
fairs in the east for several years and
has been a winner everywhere. He
has played return dates wherever he
has appeared as his act is one that
will send a thrill through every one
who witnesses it. He slides down a
70-foot incline on roller skates, leaps
.nto the air while traveling at a hun
dred miles a minute, turns a complete
somersault and lands upon his feet
on a platform twenty-five feet away.
It is an act requiring the most per
feet skill as one inch variance from
the exact point of leaving the shoots
or landing place may cause his death.
The three men composing the Ramzo.
an( j Arno troupe will furnish most
amusing entertainment for the chil
dren. They are wonders in produc
ing the most comical situations and
effects. Their act of the trained ze-jl*p
bra has brought them wide publicity 1
everywhere and they will make you
laugh even though you try not to do
so . This act is one of the best ever
sen t out and will be worth the price

The racing program this year will

class than last year and this means
that every race will be run to win.
The novelty race, the Three-Em
race open to men, mules and motor
cycles will be particularly interesting
: as will be the bicycle race, the endur- j
! ante race and the stock car automobile j
; race. Altogether the fair this year
will be the biggest and best ever
and should attract a greater attend
T . !
one. It
ance than any previous
should be attended not only by every

one in Valley County but a large at
tendance is expected to be here from
Williston and other eastern cities.
