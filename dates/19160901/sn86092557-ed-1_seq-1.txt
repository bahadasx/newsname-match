vote finally on the Adamson bill introduced
yesteVday with the approval ot
the administration at 4:30 this afternoon.
The Senate convened at ten to
take up the bill on which the Interstate
Commerce committee worked
throughout the night after an all day
bearing.
Both House and Senate bill would
provide for payment of pro rata wages
for time over elgbt hours and both
would have to be investigated bv a
commission of three members appointed
bjr the President to report Its recommendations
in from six to nine
months after the law becomes effec- _
tive.
This date Is set for December 1 by <
the House bill and January 1 by the 1
Senate bill. The Senate measure also
would exempt railroads less than 100
miles long and the electric street and
lnterurban lines. The house would allow
125.000 for the commission and
Senate $50,000.
President Wilson arranged to leave
at 3 p. m. for his summer home at Long |
Branch, N. J., where he wtll be notified
tomorrow of his nomination. A spe- |
cial messenger will be dispatched to j
him with the bill when It Is passed.
Brotherhood leaders have reaffirmed
their intention of considering the 1
passage of an eight-hour bill as satis- I
factory settlement and have promised
to call off the strike If it is enacted before
totaorrow night.
Speaker Clark believes Congress
can adjourn by Wednesday if the strike
legislation Is disposed of tomorrow.
Majority leader Kern said after the
president's visit that the Democrats
would concentrate on the eight hour
bill and put over the rest of the railroad
legislation until next week. A
number of the Democrats felt that
there would be little disposition among
Republicans to filibuster against the
eight hour bill In view of the present
conditions.
The Senate committee has determined
that there was too much opposition
to the Inter state commerce commission's
enlargement bill to risk attacking
!t to the emergency legislation.
Senator Kewlands said the committee
a<so was considering Inrludlng a provision
to empower the inter stats Commerce
commission to fix the schedule
of wages upon railroads. "We will
have to do this sometime and mleht
as wall do It now," he said, lie also
was Inclined to urge the committee
to Include In the eight hour bill s.imo
features of the proposed amendment
to the arbitration act which would prevent
future strikes during investigation.
Tnere seemed to be Utile prospect
that the committee would agree to
that because of the certainty that It
would prcvoke opposition. ?
President Wilson, It was said, had
become convinced that the only thing
that could be done at once, was the
prompt passage of the eight hour bill
and had urged the Senate hill adhere
as elosolv as possible to fno Adamson
bill In the House.
The railroad heads having voiced a ]
protest against legislation did nothing
today, awaiting Its outcome.
Iiarrtng unforeseen complications
It seemed assured today that Congress '
would act finally before Saturday
right and In time for tbe brotherhood
heads to :aU off the strike for cesen
?, in. muiiuay muming.
Republican senators in conference
today decided to draft legislation of ,
their oan to offer as a substitute for ,
.tint vrotosod by Democrnts to avert ,
the threatened strike.

In case it should occur the committee

Pittsburgh within two or three days.
This with the present boat connections

? IN COUNTY
CAN TOMATOES
????
Are Also Preparing Exhibit
For the Agricultural
Show.
Members ot the Girls' Garden and
Canning clubs, of which Miss Cora V.
Price is the presiding genius, are busy
all over the county this week canning
tomatoes. The Marion county crop
ot tomatoes this year is not as good
as it might be because of late blight,
but In the gardens grown by the club
members themselves, where plenty
of spraying was done, the yield was
splendid and hundreds of cans, each
one of which contains 38 ounces ot
tomatoes, are being put up. The work
will continue for some time. Today
Miss Price is at the home of Evelyn
McAllister at Benton Ferry and all ot
next week she will he at Farmlngton.
During the fore part of the week she
will assist at the home of Miss Ola
Lough where 1.500 cans will be filled.
While this is going on the club
members are preparing their exhibits
for the agricultural show which will
soon be held in this city. It Is the
hope ot Miss Price that the show exhibit
will outsbine that made at the
fair, which was very highly praised
by all the experts. The expense of
the fair exhibit ot the girls who came
to Fairmont to attend the canning
school, conducted by instructors from
the state headquarters at Morgantown,
and for other activities of the
club members which cost money have
been defrayed from the treasury of ;
the Home Economics Central which
for efficiency and interest displayed
by the members had far exceeded the
expectations of the organizers. The
women who belong to the Central
have been raising the money which
they generously devote to the welfare
of the young members of Miss Price's
clubs by holding socials and festivals
throughout the county.
vThree girls won trips to Morgantown
by their entries in the garden
and canning cldb display at the fair,
Lena Huey, a first year girl, and Dencle

CLOSING SESSION
OMNSTITUTE
Marion County Teachers
Meeting Completed
Work Today.
The completion of the Marlon County
Teachers' Institute this morning
marks the close of the most successful
affair of the kind ever held in the county,
both In attendance and In the
amount of work completed. The session
today only occupied the morning
and adjournment for the year was
made sit noon today.
Superintendent Helter gave his reg
ular morulrg address, usli.g "The Educational
Value of the Story." for his
topic. This talk was of unusual interest
because of the many humorous
statements that were made by Mr. Helter
in illustrating his various points.
One of the main thoughts which he emphasized
very Btrongly was: "The purpose
or point that was In the mind of
the author when he wrote the story,
must be clearly in the mind of the
teacber before she tries to teach it to
the students."
Mr. Rynearson made his final address
on two different topics, the first
being "Vocational Guidance," and the
second "Government Aid for Manual
Training." After hearing a very in
terestlng talk on these two topics the
teachers were presented their attendance
certificates. A number of matters
of Importance were taken up and
discussed at the business session, after
which the Institute adjourned.
Arrest Men Who
Shot Officers
The two foreigners who shot and

Jail to await a hearing. Deputy
Marshal J. B. Moore, of Phillppl,
who arrived in Fairmont today, assisted
in the capture of the men and stated
