ASIIINGTON, Sept. ]?Meas
ures which will result In rescinding
orders for a railway strike next Mon
day may be passed by the House and
Senate nnder special rule today and
within twenty-four hours may be on
their way to receive President Wil
son's signature.
Both houses had under considera
tion virtually identical bills estab
lishing an eight-hour day for train
men in interstate railway commerce
and providing for a commission to
study the effect, and President Wil
son was on hand to press for their
Immediate passage.
He went to the capltol shortly
ifter !t o'clock to confer with Senate
and House leaders. He urged as
much speed as possible in the con
sideration of the legislation.
The House met at 11 o'clock to
rote finally on the Adamson bill, in
troduced yesterday with the approval
| Df the administration, at 4:30 this
^ ifternoon. The Senate convened at
10 o'clock to take up the hill on
Milch the interstate commerce com
mittee worked throughout the night
after an all day hearing.
Both House and Senate bills would
provide for payment of pro rala
wages from time over the eight hours
?nd both would have the investi
gating commission of three members
appointed by the president report Its
recommendation in from six to nine
months after the law becomes ef
fective.. This day Is set at Decem
ber 1 by the House bill and January
1 by the Senate bill. The Senate
measure also would exempt railroads
less than 100 miles long and electric
street and interurban lines. The
House would allow $25,000 for the!
commission and the Senate f50,000. ?
President Wilson arranged to leave
it 3 p. m. for his summer home at
Long Branch, N. J., where he will
be notified tomorrow of his nomina
tion and a special messenger will be j
despatched to him with the bill when
It is passed.
Brotherhood leaders have reaffirm
ed their intention of considering pro
fusions of the eight-hour bill a satis
factory settlement and have promised
to call off the strike if it is enacted
before tomorrow night.
Speaker Clark believes Congress
:an adjourn by Wodnesdav if the
strike legislntlon is disposed of to
morrow.
Majority Leader Kern said after
the president's visit that the Demo
crats would concentrate on the eight
hour bill and put over the rest of
the railroad legislation until next
week. Many of the Democrats felt
there would be little disposition
among the Republicans to filibuster
against the eight-hour bill, in view
of the present conditions.
The Senate committee determined
there was too much opposition to the
Interstate Commerce Commission en
largement bill to risk attaching It to
the emergency legislation.
Senator Newlands said the com
mittee also was considering includ-l
Ing a provision to empower the Inter
state Commerce Commission to tlxj
(he schedule of wages upon railroads.
"We will have to do this sometime j
?nd might as well do it now," he
?aid. He also was Inclined to urge
the committee to Include in the eight
aour bill some features of the pro
posed amendment to the arbitration
act, which would prevent future
strikes during investigation. There
seemed to be little prospect that the
committee would agree to that be
cause of the certainty that It would
provoke opposition. President Wil
son, It was said, had become con
vinced that the only thing that could
be dono at once was the passage of
the eight-hour bill and had urged
that the Senate bill adhere as close
ly as possible to the Adamson bill in
the House.
The railway heads having voiced
their protest against the legislation
did nothing today awaiting its out
:ome.
Barring unforseen circumstances It
teemed assured today that Congress
would act finally before Saturday
alght and In time for the brotherhood
heads to call off the strike set for 7
o'clock Monday morning.
Republican senators In a confer
ence today decided to draft legisla
tion of their own to offel* as a substi
tute for that proposed by the Demo
irats to avert the threatened strike.
A. B. Garretson, spokesman for the
ptflroad brotherhoods, held a brief

Campaign They Are Putting Up
in West Virginia is
Marvelous.
MORGANTOWX, " Sept. * 1.?It was
Bald at state suffrage bcadqparters
this morning that when the women
have achieved their victory at the polls
in .November they will actually have
earned it. The state-wide campaign
(or the adoption of the pending amend
ment is of the most vigorous and well
planned sort. It Is being conductcd
on the highest plane and is in charge
ot women of the highest class. Old
campaigners of the male persuasion
have expressed amazement at the re
sults already achieved. If they but
knew of the scant campaign fund with
which this great question Is being pre.
sented they would be even more as
tonished. Their spirit of fair play
would be aroused and they would see
to It that from now on adequate funds
are provided.
The equal suffrage league of Morgan
county Is one of the most active In the
state. It is doing a wonderful work
in its bailiwick. But it, too, feels the
hamper of the short treasure chest.
These excellent women have solved
their money troubles by opening an
exchange for the sal eof articles of
their own handicraft. In a circular
now being sent out they say that the
only way In which a woman can con
tribute to her cause is to earn what
she contributes. The only way in
which she can earn anything is in the
way the most rabid antl could not
cavil at?hy Belling articles she has
made In her own home.
Continuing the circular says: "With
this end In view we have opened an
exchange where we have for sale many
articles all of which have been made
by tho hands of our women. Hand
woven colonial ruga and baskets,
quilts, baby garments of all kinds ex
qulsietly embroidered, crocheted and
embroidered luncheon setB, cetncr
pieces, piano scarfs, table runners.
Orders will be taken for entire layettes
and trouseau embroidered. In fact
we will fill orders for anything that
can be bought in the shops."
The officers of this enterprising
branch of the state organization arc
Mrs. F. V. Campbell, president; Mrs.
E. Van Hansselaer, flrBt vice presi
dent; Mrs. Salllc Horn, second vice
president; Miss Kathryn Hunter, sec
retary; Mrs. H. W. Bayer, treasurer;
and Mrs. G. Mclntire Weaver, execu
tive secretary. All communications
should be addressed to Mrs. Mclntlre

CLOSING DAY OF
TEACHERS' MEET
In the City Marks the Observ
ance of One of the Best
Programs.
After the Hons service the first
period of the morning program of the
teachers' Institute was used by Pro
fessor L. J. Hanlfan dlBcusslng the
subject: "Outside School Activities."
In his talk he took up the following
points: This year has been set apart
as the year for the teachers to em
phasize thrift In their teaching. He
spoke especially of the pupils' sav
ings bank account movement, and
cited Franco as an example of a
thrifty nation, that country being one
among the first to adopt this plan.
The general plan Is for the teacher
to collect funds from the children and
take wre of this money until each
child has at least one dollar, then this
Is deposited at the bask In the child's
own name and he receives a bank
book. He said that thrift Is not be
ing taught In the homes as thorough
ly as It should and It Is the duty of
the teachers to supplement tho work
of the home along this line. He urged
the teachers to take up at least one
of the things he has mentioned here
this week and try to carry It out the
coming year In their work. He then
spoke a few words In regard to some
of the reading circle books for the
coming year. At the close of his talk
he said that he" sincerely appreciated
the kindness shown him by the teach
ers, expressed his willingness to help
them in any way he could, and said
his work hero this week had been a
pleasure to him.
Mrst Sylvia Saurborne, of the Gras
flolll schools, then gave a demonstra
tion recitation with primary class of
pupils nationalities. The work was
well done.
After the class was dismissed Dr.
Minnlch led a discussion of the man
ner in which the recitation was con
ducted.
Modern Spelling.
After Intermission Prof. Jackson
took up the subject, "Spelling?Yes
terday and Today."
It was brought out that the pupils
of today are not less efficient In spell
ing than those of former days. He
took up the history of spelling, show
ing that In early days it was thought
that the child muBt be able to spell
before It could read. Toward the
close of the nineteenth century tho
correlattonlBts appeared, and said
there was no need of a separte period
for teaching spelling, but that It
should he taught In connection with
other subjects. But today we have
come to realize that the only time we
need to spell a word is when wo
want to write It. To know what
words to eliminate and how to do it
Is a problem. The best way to classi
fy words Is according to their mean
ing or use.
The three essential factors in
teaching spelling are, first, to teach
the meaning of the word, second,
to write tho word with the letters
In their propor order. Ho npoko of
tho Importance of the toachcr em
phnRlzInc the correct way to Kpell a
word Instend of calling attention to
an Incorrect way.
Dr. MInnlch then spoke a short
time "How to Think."
He Bpoko of the necessity of veri
fying every observation ono makes;
after making a guess, verify It. In
our schools creative as well as re
flective thinking should be encour
aged. Teach the children to do con
structive work.
