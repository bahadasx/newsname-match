ASTORIA EDITOR HERE
J. S. Dolliuger, editor and pro
prietor of the Dally Astorian, pub
lished at Astoria, was a business
visitor to St. Helens Tuesday. He
waa accompanied by his wife, son
and mother-in-law, Mrs. N. J. Staliey
of Portland. The Dcllingers left As
toria last Friday and motored to
Portland via the new highway just
recently opened to Nehnlcm and
Tillamook. They report this portion
of the highway In very good condi
tion. From Tillamook they came to
Portland via Sheridan and McMlnn-
villo und this roud is also in fairly
;ood shnpo except in some spots it
is very duaty. They returned to As
toria via the Columbia highway. Mr.
Dellinger has some splendid views
taken on the lower Columbia high
way which he has promised to send
the Mist. Mr. Dellinger was much
surprised to learn that our county
had spent a million dollars in the
past four years on roads without
having more roads than we have, and
was of the opinion that our funds
must have been spent along the same
line cs in Clatsop, whero he claims
thousands of dollars have been ex
pended without much to show
ho taxpayers' money.

LOCAL AGENT
Mrs. Stella Miller has been ap
pointed as Columbia county repre
sentative of the Oregon Life Insur
ance Company. The Increasing busi
ness of this popular home institution

a local representative, and Mrs. Mil
ler was chosen to look after it. Her
extensive acquaintance in this com
munity nnd her well known ability
in business affairs means for the
company a good business and care
fill management. Any person desir
ing information on the question of
life Insurance should call on Mrs.
Miller. The Oregon Life has made
a record In Oregon that may be point
ed to with pride and issues some
of the- best contracts that can bs

are consistent with good business
und that will compare with any other
