His Request Flatly Denied, but Garretson
Says If Eight-Hour Bill Passes
It Will Satisfy Brotherhoods.
fFrcm a Staff Corresrondfnt of The Tribune. ]
Washington. Allf. 31.?The threatened railvvay strike will
be averted. That is the belief in Washington to-night.
Administration leaders made mprked progress to-day tow
ard enaeting the President's legislative programme to prevent
a walkout. By Saturday night, it is expected. the bill provid
ing an eight-hour basic day at the present ten-hour rate will
be law.
Heads of the railway brotherhoods announced officially to
night that the passage of the measure would be considered a
satisfactory settlement and would lead them to revoke the
strike order. N
The outlook for the passage of this legislation, aoceptable
to the four train service brotherhoods. appeared brighter to
night than ftt any time since the President sought the assistanco
of Congress to save the nation from the impending calamity.
Efforts Concentrated on One Bill.
Leaden of both Houses and the President himself are <<>n
centratir.g their efforts on this one bill. The four brotherhood
chiefs have v.aved the red flag before them effectively, it ?cetna,
by obdurately refusing to take any aetion to postpone (he strike
unless a settlement on the eight-hour basis Was forthcoming.
The House bill, shorn of the two provisions that would ex
cite the greatest opposition and probably hinder its passage in
time to avert the crisis, was agreed upon by President Wilson
and the House leaders at a conl'erence at the Capitol this morn
ing. The Interstate Commerce Committee of the Senate delib
erated upon it to-night, and it is expected to be introduced in
the upper body to-morrow morning. It has already been intro?
duced in the House by Chairman Adamson.

-The railroads would take r.o pre

Uill- Slightly Different.
There is but slight difference in tha
bill introduced in the House this af
ternoon and from that which wil! ba
brought into the Senate in the morn
ing. The House bill provides for an
eight-hour ba: ic pay day at the present
ten-hourly rate beginning December I.
ThaflaOOta hi'.l as agreed upon to-night,
substantially the aame as the ilousa
measure, sets the date for January 1,
but an agreement on this wil "be easy.
It was said that an attempt might ba
made to force the passaga of the Sen?
ate measure before to-morrow ni?ht,
too, bu* that is hardly probable.
