PRESIDENT TO 00
BEFORE CONGRESS
Both Houses to Be Called In
Special Session.
WILSON PREPARES MESSAGE
Executive Is Determined to Take Ac
tion Which Will Insure Operation
ot Carriers-Still Hopes Mediation
Will Point Way to Adjustment.
Washington, Aug. 29.-President
Wilson has decided definitely to go be
fore congress in person to recommend
legislation to avert the threatened na
tionwide railroad strike, Cr stop it if it
cormes before congress can act.
ide worked until late at night rn his
message, in which he will tell mem
bers of the senate and house the ne
gotiations to date and lay before them
a definite legislative program.
Long in Conference.
The president reached this decision
after conferences at the White House
with the committee of eight railroad
presidents and the four brotherhood
heads, on a new proposal for settle
muent of differences, suggested by the
executives, and after a prolonged dis
cussion of the situation at the capitol
with the members of the Democratic
steering committee of the senate.
The proposal of the railroad execu
tives was that an investigation of all
issues be conducted by a commission
to be named by the president, the in
vestigation to last for a period of
three or four months, no action to be
taken by either side in the meantime,
and, at the conclusion of the inquiry,
the situation to be what it is now, the
employes having the choice of either
arbitrating or striking.
Men Stand by Order.
The brotherhood heads promised a
reply and there was every indication
it would be unfavorable.
When the railroad brotherhood
heads went to the White House the
president not only laid before them
the plan of the executives, but strong
ly urged the withdrawal of a tentative
strike order sent out subject to release
calling for a walkout of the 400,000
brotherhood members at 7 a. m. Labor
day, Sept. 4.
This request was refused flatly, the
leaders saying only the committee of
640, which has left Washington, had
power to recall the order.
Copies of the strike order were
brought to the president's attention
after they had got into the possession
of the railroad executives.
Wilson Greatly Perturbed.
It had been known that the mem
bers of the committee of 640 carried
hone with them a tentative order. but
no one outside of the brotherhood
councils had suspected that a date
had been set, and the president is said
to have been greatly perturbed by the
infmnation. After the refusal to
withdraw the order. he communicated
with the railroad presidents, who held
a meeting that lasted until late In the
night.
In spite of the apparent final failure
of his efforts to bring the two sides to
gether. the president was represented
a.s being still hopeful of averting a
strike.
Raise in Rates Favored.
The legislative Grogram prepared
for congrees includes an eight-hour
day law for railroad employes so
framed ac to give the railrcads time
to prrrare for it. and a law, patterned
after the Canadian industrial disputes
act. providing for an investigation of
industrial disputes on railroads by a
cor mission and prohibiting strikes or
lockouts pending the outcome of the
investigation. In addition to these
measures, there are under considera
tion.a resolution to increase the reve
nue of the railroads in case the ex
penses are Increased, and a law cre
ating authority for the operation of
the railroads under the federal gov
ernment in event of a strike.
The plan was to have the first two
measures Introduced as amendments
to the bill, which already has passed
the house, increasing the Interstate
commerce commission from seven to
nine members.
President Is Determined.
Although on the surface a nation
wide railroad strike was nearer than
It ever has been, confidence was ex
pressed in official quarters that the
steps under contemplation would have
the effect of preventing the walkout.
The president, realizing the disaster
which will come to the country if the
railroads are tied up, is said to be de
termined to prevent a strike at any
cost.
In his conferences with the execu
tives he strongly urged that they
change their hitherto unyielding atti
tude, and when he saw the employes
he declared that all suggestions from
the executives should be given most
careful consideration.
Final arrangements for the appear
ance of the president before congress
were not completed but he discussed
the decision fully with the Democratic
steering committee of the senate and
they agree with him that he should
address a joint session.
The time of his appearance defends
largely upon further conferences with
the executives and the employes.
FIFTEENTH NATION
TO ENTER CONFLICT
Paris, Aug. 29.-Roumania has de
clared war on the central powers, fol
lowing a meeting of the Roumanian
crown council, according to dispatches
received here.
The crown council went into ses
sion immediately after .a meeting of
representatives of the leading Ilouma
nian political parties, former prime
ministers and cabinet members and
Roumanian financiers.
The purpose of this meeting was to
acquaint King Ferdinand with public
sentiment in Roumania.
It is reported in delayed press dis
patches that General Averescu, former
minister of war, will be named com
mander of the Roumanian army.
The immediate effect of the Rou
mainian declaration in all probability
will be to cause the early withdrawal
of the Bulgarian forces that invaded
Greece to protect the Bulgarian north
ern frontier against a Roumanian in
vasion. The Roumanians presumably
will form a junction with the Rus
sians operating in Bukowina and throw
an army across the Hungarian fron
Lier into Transylvania, long coveted
by the Roumanians.
Roumania's chief reason for enter
ing the war is the hope of annexing
to her present territory the two Aus
trian provinces of Transylvania and
Bukowina. They are inhabited largely
by Roumanians.
SLUMP IN WHEAT MARKET
Chicago, Aug. 29.--Rouniania's dec
laration of war smashed the wheat
market.
Opening prices showed a fall in
some cases amounting to 5% cents a
bushel. September delivery, which
closed at $1.51%, started at $1.46@
1.48%. Other options broke wildly.
General rushes to sell took place
and sales were enlarged by the in
Icreased chances of a general railway
strike in the United States.
Before the descent of price could
be checked losses that reach to 8%
cents a bushel were shown for the
principal trading month, December,
which sold as low as $1.4:1//.
Although the tremendous pressure
to unload holdings carried away tem
porarily all their considerations the
extraordinary break in value proved
too tempting fror buyers and the mar
ket rallied 3% cents from the lowest
level which had been touched.
The upturns, however, left prices
still 3% to 5 cents down.
Bear traders generally viewed the
action of Roumania as likely to prove
a big factor in forcing a more speedy
end of hostilities, or would at least
tend to hurry the opening of the Dar
danelles and so release huge Russian
shipments of wleat.
FREIGHT HANDLERS ANGRY
Chicago, Aug. 29.-A general strike
of 6,000 freight handlers in Chicago
will be called at once unless officials
of the Chicago, Burlington and Quin
cy railroad grant the union the right
to have its business agents enter
freight houses to collect dues, J. P.
Roche, secretary of the union, an
nounced.
The railroads will not agree to the
demands of the union, F. E. Forbes,
chief clerk of the freight department,
said.
WILL ASK HIGHER WAGES
New York, Aug. 29.-Employes of
the United States Steel corporation
and the big meat packing plants
throughout the United States are be
ing organized and are almost ready to
present demands for better wages and
working conditions, according to
Frank Morrison, secretary of the
American Federation of Labor.
Nurse Weds Soldier Patient.
London.-Miss Alice Davis, a pretty
Virginia girl, who has been nursing
wounded soldiers at the County hos
pital, Dorchester, was married to one
of her patients, Trooper Larkia of the
Australian imperial force, who was in
jured while fighting in the Gallipoli
campaign.
PRAY BEATS EDWARDS;
ED WARDSFOR GOVERNOR
Primary election results show
some surprises. On the repub
lican ticket former congressman
Charles N. Pray has undoubtedly
beaten State Senator John E.
Edwards for U. S. senator,
while Frank J. Edwards of Hel
ena, is in the lead for the nom
ination for governor, with Cooney
of Great Falls and Galen of Hel
ena next in order named. Farr
of Miles City, and Miss .Jean
ette Rankin of Missoula, are
in the lead for representatives in
congress, with Miss Rankin cer
tain of one of the nominations,
but Linderman is giving Farr a
close race for the other place.
Gov. Stewart is renominated,
but Miles Romney beat him in
Butte and other labor centers.
Evans is renominated and the
other democratic nominee for
congress will be either Cutts of
Butte, or Mitchell of Great Falls,
with the latter in the lead. From
the meagre returns received the
other places on both tickets are
not definitely settled.
In Missoula county Pray beats
Edwards for senator; Edwards
leads for governor; for county
officers the nominees for the leg
islature will be Bouck, Buell,
Lusk, McQuarrie and Higgins;
sheriff, Dave Graham; county
attorney, W. E. Moore; commis
sioner, C. H. Marsh; treasurer,
Mrs. Mabel K. Hall; auditor, L.
M. Beard; public administrator,
EASTERN PRESS
BOOSTS MONTANA
"Montana today is the fastest grow
ing state in the Union," Howard D.
Hadley tells the people of the east
through tha columns of the New York
Post. Mr. Hadley is one of the staff
correspondents that is making the
swing around the circle with Mr.
Hughes, and three-fourths of a column
and a half article sent from Spokane
is devoted to the Treasure State. He
writes:
"Montana's extraordinary growth in
population during the last five or six
years, and the figures which show the
well-nigh incredible crops of wheat,
rye, oats, potatoes, etc., which she
now produces, form one of the amaz
ing things to be seen in a tour across
the continent.
To show what a rush of settlers has
gone into Montana, it is a matter of
record that more than 30,000,000 acres
vaiuable land of the public domain-
an area equal to the state of Iowa
have been taken up and settled on dur
ing the last six years. These new set
tlers, so Louis W. Hill, president of
the Great Northern railway says, have
been drawn very largely from the
strongly Republican states of Ohio,
Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and the
Dakotas, and a good majority of them
are republicans. It is this change in
the electorate, together with the fact
that women will vote this fall in Mon
tana for the first time in a presidential
year which makes the Republicans feel
more than confident they will carry
Montana for Hughes and send a repub
lican to the United States senate in
place of Senator Myers, a demorat,
whose term expires next March.
"Montana today is the fastest grow
ing state in the Union. Most persons
back east think of Montana as a col
lection of pretty rough mining camps,
clustered around some of the richest
copper mines in the world, surrounded
by a wilderness of woods and rocks,
where its nine months winter and
three months late in the fall. Rich as
the mines are, the fact remains that
Montana's great wealth lies in her ag
ricultural possibilities. Look at the
figures showing the growth agricultural
Montana has had in ten years:
W. P. Hoopes; other places not
contested.
For county officers on the dem
ocratic ticket it appears that
Adams, Cooney, Buckhouse,
Heyfron and Mason are nomi
nated; Prescott for county com
missioner; Green for sheriff; An
gevine for attorney; Roberts for
auditor; Arnold for public ad
ministrator, other places uncon
tested.
For judge on the republican
ticket the nomination goes to
Lentz, Taylor and Burleigh, and
on the democratic ticket it will
be Duncan, Hall and McCulloch,
either one of whom should be
able to beat Burleigh at the gen
eral election.
Only about 50 per cent of the
vote was cast in Missoula county
as a whole, while on the reser
vation not to exceed 33 per cent
of the vote was out. This fact
accounts for the loss to the res
ervation of at least one place on
the ticket, and the people here
should not complain hereafter of
Missoula "hogging" everything.
If voters in the county will not
turn out and vote for local can
didates it comes with bad grace
to "holler" afterward. Dr. Res
ner should have gone off the res
ervation with 300 majority, but
he fell 200 short of that figure.
That would not have nominated
him, but it would have shown
that the people here wanted a
county commissioner.

"The gains in 1915 were even more
extraordinary, and the rush to take up
land in Montana is still in full swing.
'With this great crop yield and high
prices for it, the Montana farmers are
rolling in prosperity, while with the
extraordinary demand for copper and
zinc, also due to the war in Europe,
the laboring men in Butte are getting
high wages. Bricklayers, painters and
plumbers get $8 a day, carpenters $7 a
day and lathers $9 a day, with double
pay for overtime-an eight hour day,
of course. Even hod carriers get $5.50
a day, while dish-washers, who also
have a union of their own, get $23.50
a week and board.
"But all this prosperity from high
wages and high prices is believed to be
temporory. The people of Montana
listened with the most earnest atten
tion to what Hughes had to say on this
score.
"The hustling, attractive and rap
idly growing city of Billings, which
was not on the original schedule, raised
$1,500 in two hours and hired a special
train from Fargo, N. D., to Billings,
in order that it could see and hear the
republican candidate for president, and,
at the same time, give Mr. Hughes
and his party a chance to see Billings.
They may well be proud of their neat,
up-to-date city of some 17,000 people,
with several transcontinental railroads
leading out through a country rich in
agricultural resources."
Praises the Flathead
Prof, F. C. Hopkins, professor of
geology in the Syracuse university,
Syracuse, N. Y., who has been touring
the Northwest and Alaska. was very
favorably impressed with the Mission
valley and had the following to say:
"This summer I have traveled thru
the states of Montana, Idaho, Wash
ington and Oregon. I have been
greatly interested, not only in the geo
graphic features, but the industrial
features along the way. I can candidly
say that in my journeys, while I have
enjoyed it all, I have not found a lo
cality that interested me more than
this wonderful Flathead country. Its
rich soil covered with its great wheat
fields, bounded by the picturesque Mis
sion range on the east and the grass
covered hills on the west, its beautiful
lake and wsnderful river, all make the
area one of beauty as well as pros
perity. In no other place in the world
is there such a large area of rich farm
land so close to a living glacier. In no
other place can so many prosperous
farmers have a glacier in the front
door yard.
"Another thing that appealed to me
was the good feeling among the peo
ple. All appeared happy, prosperous
and contented and they enjoy some of
the many pleasures at hand. Sunday
we drove to the beautiful canyon and
falls of the Flathead river with our
neighbors, the Carsten's and Vance's,
all like one big family, a day of pleas
ure for the whole family, old and
young alike.
"The week spent with Uncle Jim
Farrow and his fine wife on their
"Home at Last" ranch has surely
been the pleasantest one of the sum
mer and we carry with us many pleas
ant memories of this great wheat
country and the people that are mak
ing it blossom like a rose."
GREECE MAYBE
NEXTTO JOIN WAR
London, Aug. 29.-Confidence that
Greece will follow the action of Rou
mania as the next nation to enter the
war and cast her lot with the allies,
pervades allied capitals and is reflect
ed in the editorial comment of the
leading newspapers.
Roumania's entrance will strengthen
the hands of Venizelos, former Greek
premier, and the pro-entente party.
The Morning Post says:
Greece Is Warned.
"For her indecision and weakness
Greece Is suffering heavily, but there
are signs that under the teachings of
bitter experience the Greek people are
coming to their senses. They will be
wise to look to it that their repentance
does not come too late."
The press lays great stress on the
economic importance of Roumania's
break with the Central powers. It is
pointed out Germany has received cat.
tie, wheat and petroleum In great
quantities from Roumania.
"The supply is cut off when the de
mand is most urgent," the Express
says.
"Can the masses in the enemy coun
try continue to believe in the legend
of victory when they see this verdict
passed by neutral statesmanship?"
the Daily Telegraph asks.
Paris Is Overjoyed.
Paris newspapers were permitted
to publish extra editions for the first
time in many months. announcing Hou
mania's decision. Great rejoicing is
reported in the French capital and
Roumanian colors decorated the city.
It is estimated the effective strength
of the Roumanian army is about 900,
000 men with artillery aggregating
480 seventy-five milimeter guns, 160
field guns and many heavy guns.
The Amsterdam Bourse, where there
is a large market for Roumania oil
stocks and which has long served as
a barometer for the Balkan situation,
had discounted Rou mania's participa
tion in the war and the quotations on
all oil stocks were only slightly lower
during the day.
Austrian exchange declined 20 cents
a hundred crowns and German ex
change 12% cents a hundred marks.
English exchange rose.
Seek Austrian Rear.
Already the troops of King Ferdi
nand are seeking entry into the plains
of Transylvania through the Eastern
Carpathians and in the direction of
Hermannstadt, evidently with a view
of attacking in the rear the Austrians
holding back the Russians from the
plains of Hungary. Vienna reports
several Roumanians captured in the
first clash.
Kronstadt and Hermannstadt are
two of the most inrportant cities in
Transylvania. Roumanians make up a
large part of the population of both.
Berlin, Aug. 29.-Discussing Rou
mania's action, the Lokal Anseiger
says: "We must expect Roumania's
entry in the war also will influence the
decision of the Greek government. The
Greek army was demobilized accord
ing to the wishes of the entente. For
eign troops are now standing on
Greek soil. It is not easy to call to
the colors under threatening guns, an
army just sent home."
Berlin took the declaration calmly.
Roumania's course was anticipated.
The news was without marked affect
on the bourse.
BIG WALKOUT IS
SET FOR SEPT. 4
Leaders Issue Order Effective
7 a. m. Labor Day.
LAW OBSERVANCE DEMANDED
Brotherhood Leaders Hold Secret
Conference With President - In.
structions Allow No Exemptions
for Troop or Milk Trains.
Washington, Aug. 29.-The follow
ing strike order effective at 7 a. in.
Sept. 4, becaige known here following
a secret conference between President
Wilson and leaders of the employes:
Sirs and Brothers: This is to ad
vise that the vote of the employes in
train and engine service on the eight
hour day and timei and one-half propo
sition was overwhelmingly in favor of
a strike.
Notwith Landing this, your repre
sentatives have been unable to effect
a satisfactory settlement, and a strike
under the laws of the respective or
ganizations becomes effective on Sept.
4, 19143, at 7 a. at.
Impart this infprmation so those In
terested will understand that they are
to promptly obey.
No man in road service involved in
the strike will perform any service
after the hour set to strike, unless he
has already begun a trip and has
actually left the terminal. If the train
has left the terminal he will complete
the trip and deliver the engine and
train at the end of the run, or tie-up
point if tied up under the law, after
which he will perform no further serv
ice until the close of the strike. Men
in other than road service will leave
the service at the appointed time.
No Exemptions for Mail Trains.
So far as your legal right to strike
is concerned, there is no difference be
tween a mail train and a freight train.
You have identically the same right to
refuse to perform service on a mail
train as you have to refuse to perform
service on a freight train.
All men on strike will keep away
from the company's property, exsept
such men as are designated certain
duties to be performed by the author
ity of the organization.
Every man should understand that
the laws of the land must be obeyed.
Acts of violence of any nature will not
be tolerated by the organizations.
Every effort was made to keep the
call at the White House secret. The
union heads returned to their hotels
singly and by separate routes. After
passing out the word that they would
meet the committee of twenty-four
again to discuss the proposal, they
went to their rooms.
News that copies of the strike order
were In the hands of the railway presi
dents occasioned no surprise among
the brotherhoods. More than five
thousand copies of the order, it was
learned, were mailed out of Washing
ton.
Labor day was agreed upon as the
time for the tentative strike order to
become operative, it developed, after
careful consideration of several dates.
It finally was chosen because of the
belief that a demonstration by the
2,000,000 or more union men who will
march in Labor day parades in behalf
of the brotherhoods would have the
effect of winning much public support
for the strikers.
Although the strike order is for 7
a. m. nest Monday, all lines affected
probably will not be tied up before
some time that night if the order is re
leased.
Every member of the brotherhood,
whether an employe on a passenger,
freight or mait train is subject to the
strike order. Brotherhood heads in
timated last week that supply trains
running to the Mexican border, some
passenger trains and possibly some
milk trains would be exempted. Now
they declare that all trains will be
tied up.
"We hope to tie up all freight and
passenger trains," one of the leaders
said.
