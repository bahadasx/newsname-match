Co-operation of County Commissioner
Ramey and Prosecuting Attorney
Rees, as well as the Governor of Ida
ho, large rewards were made avail
able for the capture of the fugitive
When the blood hounds were brought
In so quickly and held in leash to be
set upon the tracks of the murderer
the following morning, hi« nucceisful
hiding any longer or the possibility
of escape was hopeless for him, al
though I he region comprises the
wildest mountain gorges and canyons
in all America. Stonewall knew those
crags and peaks and valleys between
as they are known by no other man,
for he had made his home in that re
gion for the many years of his callng
as a trapper of wild anim ils.
It was all a part of the proper sort
of preparedness in having in office In
tlie emergency the right kind of sher
iff, ao officer of the priper mettle and
discretion, coolness and courage to
cow and dishearten any criminal.
Stonewall Billengee knew Stroud
would get him sooner or later. That
lH why he surrendered.
There Is a question as to where
will go the reward offered by the
Governor of Idaho and the County
Commissioners, $250 by the state and
$600 by the county. Commissioner
Ramey, though not advised by tin le
gal requirements that may be made,
says he is of the opinion that tlie re
ward cannot be demanded by any
body, for the reason that there was
practically no arrest at all but a vol
untary surrender on the part of ttie
fugitive. County Attorney Rees
holds similar views on the matter
The brother of the accused seems to
nave been In communication with
him and that wrould shut tlie brother
out of the getting tlie reward, in the
opinion of Mr. Rees.
It was early in the third night after
his flight that Stonewall Ballengee
determined to surrender and answer
to the law for kiiing Vivian Hovey.
It was then that iie met his brother,
Jimmie Ballengee. and Ed Allen,
both employed in the forest service
near lndianola, with whom lie re
turned to the Alien camp later and
awaited tlie appearance there of tlie
sheriff. The officer and his deputies
had been watching tlie openings for
Stonowall ever since h few hours after
tlie commission of the crime charged :
against Stonewall when lie went iutOj
hiding. Word was carried to the taan
in hiding that the officer was deter-1
mined to tout tiim and that blootl
hounds were to be put on his trail.
When he met tbe sheriff Stonewall
told him he had observed his move
ments tlie day liefore and would then
have surrendered if he had recognized
the officer at the time Tlie day aftei
