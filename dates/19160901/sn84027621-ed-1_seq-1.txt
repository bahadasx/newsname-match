No Passenger Elevator Provided for
Chimney at Water and Electric
- Plant
In constructing the : chimney for
the new light and water, plant the en
gineers have made a very serious
mistake. This was discovered this
morning by a representative of the
Star. The engineers should have pro
vided a passenger elevator in the tall
stack. The Star's representative
climbed' to the top of ' the chimney,
and for the first time got a birds-eye
view of the city. Hereafter, however,
the birds can have the lookout to
themselves if they want i unless
that elevator is installed. Climbing up
the inside of a chimney is like climb
ing the backside of a ladder.
Beyond the city limits there is not
much to be seen from the top of - the
stack. The 180-fbot stand pipe will
give a better view. But it is said
there will be Jno elevator for that
either.
HAMPSHIRE HOGS WILL BE
DISTRIBUTED TOMORROW
After arriving yesterday . the 28

boars were unloaded in ' the Coast

stables of Nichols & Cobb on Broad
way, where, at 10 o'clock tomorrow
morning the distribution to the pig
club boys will be made. The hogs
are fine ones and arrived in good con
dition. The shipment came in charge of
Mr. Lambert Ogle, of Sheridan, Ind.
He left Sheridan with the car last
Saturday, Mr. Ogle raised all but
two of the hogs himself, and came
with them personally to see that
they got here in ; good shape. He
thinks ; Marion county is ma King a
move in the right direction in adopt
ing one breed of hogs This is his
first visit to Florida. , Mr. Ogle said
this morning that, as an encourage
ment for the boys, he would pay $25
cash for the pig winning first prize
at the Marion County Fair this fall,
if the hoy wants to sell it. The fair
association-, offers $4 as a prize for
the best, pig raised by the pig club
boys, and if the winner wishes to sell
to ,Mr. Ogle he will be getting $29
for his pig, whether it be a boar or a
sow.
jPie 26 hogs raised by Mr. Ogle are
a part of a herd of 60 which, at pub
ic sale, sold for $2975.50 in Sheridan
on August 23. Mr. Ogle says that
Mr. E. C. Stone, secretary of the Na
tional Hampshire Association, paid
about $300 more for the hogs than
they are being, delivered here for.
All of the hogs are registered.
Eight of the sows are bred grandsons
of Messenger Boy, five times grand
champion over all breeds. Five are

Four sows are bred to sons of Mes

scendents of Pat Malloy, also grand

IN THE SHERIFF'S RACE
In his written decision in the con
test of the sheriff's race, Judge Bul
lock finds "that as a matter of fact
that the contestant, John P. Galloway,
received a total of 539 first choice
votes and 166 second choice votes,
making a total of 705 votes; and that
the contestee, V. F. Adams, received
495 first choice votes and 202 second
choice votec, making a total of 697
votes, in accordance with the commis
sioners' count, and the counting and
throwing out of certain ballots by the
ccurt on this hearing, and that, there
fore, the contestant received a major
ity of eight votes over the contestee,
and that in fact the voters of Marion
county Voted a majority in favor of
the said 'John P. Galloway, the con
testant, and that he, the said John P.
Galloway, is, therefore, entitled to the
nomination to the office of sheriff in
Marion "county, Florida, at the demo
cratic primary held on June 6th, 1916,
and that he, the said John P. Gallo
way, is the democratic nominee for
the office of sheriff of Marion county,
Florida."
The court decrees that the certifi
cate of nomination given Mr. Adams
is illegal and void, and Mr. Adams is
given five days in which to surrender
the certificate. The county canvass
ing board i3 required to reassemble
and re-canvass the returns of the
primary in so far as the sheriffs of
fice in concerned, and to issue a cer
tificate of nomination to Sheriff Gal
loway, and to place his name upon
the ticket for the general election in
November. Mr. Adams is ordered to
pay the cost of the proceeiings: $15
to each commissioner that made the
recount, $2.50 for taking of testi
mony, o for cost of court.
It is stated that the court decided
that of the contested ballots, thrown
out by the commissioners, those .
should be counted which showed the
apparent intention of the voter, and
that those not showing apparent in
tention shou!d not be counted. There
were thirty votes thrown out by the
commissioners. Of these the court
counted 11 for Sheriff Galloway and
seven for Mr. Adams.
The court adjudged that the Fort
McCoy precinct be counted as shown
by the ' inspectors , and clerk's report,
excepting that of three second choice
votes received off of John T. Lewis
only two should be counted for Sheriff
Galloway.
The contestee contended that there
was one first choice vote in precinct
No. 9, and one in precinct No. 22,
which should not have been counted
for Sheriff Galloway. The court held
that the first chaoice vote in No. 9 be
counted and the one in No. 22 be not
counted.
