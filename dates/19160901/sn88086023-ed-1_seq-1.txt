olation of the recent treaty signed
with canada and the federal bird law.
Tne recent treaty with Canada,
which follows the federal law. is sale:
to have been passed with an idea to
bolstering up the taw. The only
foundation, according to Mr. Steiwer
for the 'federal law and regulation of
the birds tests on the fact that birds
move from state to state and are
therefore of an interstate commerce

the law unconstitutional ami the su
preme court declared the law as such
The supreme tribunal has granted the

In connection with an observance
of the law. Deputy 7ame Warden
Tonkin warns hunters from shooting
doves from the public highway or the
