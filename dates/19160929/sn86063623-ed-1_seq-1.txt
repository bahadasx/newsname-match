VOL. XLVI
LEXINGTON, LAFAYETTE COUNTY, MISSOURI, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1916.
Number 39.
ALUMNI 18; CADETS 11.
Old Boys Had Too Much Beef
and Experience for Younger
Opponents.
The annual foot ball game be
tween the Alumni and Cadets of
Wentworth was played Saturday
as per schedule, and a right in
teresting contest was the result.
The old tops did a lot of puffing
and snorting before the game
was over, but then they got re
sults and that's what counts in
the end.
In the backfield was Ralph
Campbell at quarter, Vore at
right half, Suppes at left half
and "Pup" Gordon at full. And
whether you believe it or not,
that was some backfield. When
ever "Pup's" valves failed him,
M. Chambers took his place and
played in old time form. Little
old Vore was the same hard
proposition to hold. His
attempts around the ends were
spectacular and while he failed
to get free, he was a constant
worry to the opposite ends.
In the line were papas, bald
heads and a few of the present
generation. Parks was the pivot.
Moore, Butler and Aull played
the guards; Sellers and Cham
bers, A., the tackles ; and "Spec"
Gordon and Groves, R., the ends.
Subs: Milton Welsh, Grimm and
Barnett.
While the "comebacks" are al
ways interesting in the initial
game of the season, the work o:
the first team receives more con
sideration and the potential pos
sibilities of the players carefully
noted. Wentworth seems to
have plenty of good materia!
irom which to make a good
team. Most of it is inexper
lenced, but Coach Kacely, no
doubt, is equal to the task of
whipping them into one of the
best teams Wentworth has ever
had. They put up a plucky con
test Saturday. The work of the
ends wa3 especially noticeable.

Machpelah Cemetery.
For years, the general condi
tion of Machpelah Cemetery has
been a matter of regret and
shame to the people of Lexing
ton. Strangers hav come, look
ed and wondered. Many lots are
cared for, a few made beautiful ;
but with children making of it
a playground and chickens feed
ing undisturbed, graves have
been desecrated, rare flowers
ruined and the owners of lots
discouraged in their efforts to
improve. Moreover the great
number of lots uncared for give
the whole place a ragged and un-
kept appearance. Various plans
have been suggested for im
provement, but none have hith
erto materialized. A movement
is now on foot that will accom
plish what has long been desired
by those whose loved ones rest
in this great city of the dead. A
committee of ladies from the
Civic League Department of the
Woman's Club and the owners
of Machpelah have had several
meetings, and are effecting
permanent organization, to take
charge of, and beautify the
cemetery. One of the first
things planned is to appoint a
day, due notice of which will be
given, on wnicn every one in
terested will be expected to go
out and help clean up. Later
whether you happen to be pu
on a committee or not, you are
requested to keep this move
ment in mind, and to do all you
can to further it. Thus the
cemetery will soon be a place
where you can visit your dead
feeling the benediction of its
peaceful lovliness.

A Distinctive Reason
What is the chief reason for the superi
ority of Dr. Price's Cream Baking Powder?
There are several good reasons, but there
is one which distinguishes Dr. Price's from
other baking powders.
This reason, which every woman should
know, is that Dr. Price's Baking Powder is
made from cream cf tartar, which comes
from grapes. This means a healthful fruit
origin. It means natural food as distin
guished from mineral substitutes used in
other baking powders.
There is no alum nor phosphate in
