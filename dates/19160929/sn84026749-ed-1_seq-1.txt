GERRARD TO REPORT TJ
GERMAN ATTITUDE wJP
Ambassador Said to Be Bring
ing Demand for Renewal of
U-Boat Warfare.
Ambassador Gerard Is coming to
America to lay before President Wilson
the details of Germany's proposed re
sumption of ruthelss submarine war
fare, which threatens to cause another
crisis In diplomatic relations between
the countries In the next three months.
This Is the gist of a Copenhagen dis
patch from Herbert B. Swope, appear
ing In a copyrighted article In the
New York World this morning.
According to the Information received
In Copenhagen, "presumably from the
ambassador or from somo one tn close
touch with him, Germany has agreed
to a postponement of the resumption
of tho extensive submarine campaign
until tho return- of tho ambassador
Berlin, or until the United States hss
taken a definite stand on the matter.
Unusual efforts will be made during
his absence to prevent any action on the
part of German naval forces which
would tend to Jeonurdlio the friendly re
lations between tho countries.
Incidentally, It Is pointed out that in
spite of tho antl-Ainerlcan sentiment In
many circles in Germany, the American
representative Iibh been able to hold
the respect of thinking persons and gov
ernment officials, even though many ot
them disagree with his vlew on Impor
tant International subjects.
According to high officials, the per
innnl ronnrt nf Ambassador Gerard to
President Wilson takes on a special sg-S
nlllcance at this time, owing to me raci
that events of the next two or three
months may tell the tale of the future
relations of the two nntlons.
Sentiment In Germany lnsnearly all
quarters In favor of a resumption of the
strenuous U-bont warfare has become
unusually strong.
The German government, despite Its
desire to continue friendly relations
with the United States, will not be able
to withstand much longer the pressure
being brought to bear, according to
Swope. Members of tho Reichstag have
been fmnk enough to declare that un
less peace Is consummated soon, the re
sumption of ruthless U-boat warfare Is
Inevitable. .
On the return of Ambassador Gerard
tho State Department will take up with
the German government negotiations lor
the payment of Indemnity to families of
me Lusuama, Aramo u" .

Ii REJECTS
HUE
OF D. C. GUARD
Effect of Disapproval Will Be to
Discharge Private Wesley
From Shooting Sentence.
CENSURES MILITIA OFFICERS
Head of Department Arraigns
"Negligent and Indifferent"
Performance of Guard Duty.
Maj. Gen. Leonard Wood, com
manding the Department of the
East, has disapproved the finding
of the 'District National Guard
court-martial, which found Private
Harold B. Wesley guilty of the ac
cidental killing of Private James
J. Spaulding, at Camp Ordway Au
gust 13.
General Wood, in general court
martial order, No. 600, now on rile
at the War Department, said the
findings o( the court were not "au
thorized in law," because the court
changed the specification "did un
lawfully, willfully and feloniously
kill" to "accidentally" kill, "while
handing said rifle without due cau
t'on and circumspection."
WILL DISCHARGE WESLEY.
The effect of General Wood's disap
proval of the court-martial findings will
be to din charge Private Wesley from
the guard' house, where he was serving
a two months' sentence since neither
General Wood nor the War Department
hse authority to aVt-trtthfffe"rmncc Im
posed, and dUapproval In this cesc
amounts to nullifying the action of the
court.
The concluding paragraph of the
court-martial order Is a severe ar
raignment of the officers of the District
National Guard, for "the grossly negli
gent and Indifferent manner of per
formance of guard duty tolerated by
local responsible officials "
The charge against Private Wesley
was changed by the District court mar
tial when it was seen that the evidence
would not warrant conviction on the
more serious charge brought under or
ders of General Wood.
General Wood'a disapproval order
holds, however, that the charge on
which Wesley wos found guilty was not
a necessary constituent of the offense
originally charged.
History of Shooting.
Spaulding, who was a private of
Company D, Third Regiment. D. C N. O..
was the son of Mr., and Mrs. Patrick
