LARGEST PLANT OF KIND IN THE
WOULD TO BE OPERATED IN
OLYMPIA.
Five huge 250-ton hydraulic press
es, each of which uses nearly two
tons of apples each time it presses,
and a large amount of other machin
ery are now being installed in the
big plant at Tumwater where the
Northwest Fruit Products company,
in which the Schmidts of this city
are the principal stockholders, will
begin operations about November 1,
pressing a 12-car trainload of apples
every 24 hours in the manufacture of
its new beverage, "Applju."
Installation of this machinery
means a practical rebuilding of the
company's big plant, including the
doubling of its refrigerating capacity.
When the plant Is put into operation
the latter part of October or first of
November, from 160 to 200 persons
will be employed, and the plant will
be operated 24 hours a day. The to
tal output of "Applju" will be ap
proximately 1,000,000 gallons.
Office Now in Olympia.
The office and headquarters of the
company were moved to Olympia
this week from Salem, Ore., and will
be maintained in this city hereafter.
The company also owns a big plant
at Bellingham, and Olympia being the
most central of the three points and
the home of the chief stockholders,
was chosen as permanent headquar
ters.
The plant will bo operated at ca
pacity pressing apples for from 30 to
40 days, more than 400 carloads of
fruit from different sections of the
state being used. So far as is known,
It will be the largest plant In the
world devoted to the making of an
apple-Juice product. After the press
ing bas been completed, a force of
approximately 100 persons will be
employed at the bottle house for five
or alx months, aso on a 24-hour
schedule, bottling the season's out
put. It is estimated that more than
200 carloads of bottles will be used.
All of the machinery being install
ed, except the big hydraulic presses,
has been specially designed for this
plant by Qus Benners, the engineer
who recently designed the largest
cold storage plant in the world just
built by the New England Fisty com
pany at Boston, Mass. Each of the
big presses uses 100 boxes of apples
at each "squeeze" made at half-hour
intervals.
Middle West Principal Market.
The company plans to market its
local product principally In the Mid
dle West, as it did its Loju, made at
the Salem plant, and will cover all
of the states west of the Mississippi
river with the organization of 42
salesmen who placed Loju on the
market. Its plans are contingent up
on freight rates and the company for
mally protested Thursday night to
the Interstate commerce commission
to recently announced increases, ask
ing that the proposed rates be sus
pended.
Frank M. Kenney of Jhis city is
president of the company and J. A.
Wilson of Salem secretary. The di
rectors are Frank T., Paul L. and
Peter G. Schmidt, Frank M. Kenney,
J. A. Wilson, Kola Neis and F. G.
Deekabach of Salem, a former resi

WILSON TO DISCUSS ISSUES.
Will Handle Politics "Without
Gloves" in S|>eech Saturday.
Friends Say.
Issues raised by Charles E. Hughes,
Republican nominee for president,
will be discussed by President Wilson
at Long Branch, N. J., Saturday in
his first purely political speech since
his address accepting the re-nomina
tion. Administration officials say
that when he appears before the mem
bers of the Young Men's Democratic
clubs at Shadow Lawn the president
will handle the political situation
"without gloves."
It was declared that following Sat
urday's speech there will be more po
litical activity on the part of the pres
ident. He will more fully develop
his views on the Adamson law, it was
declared, and in addition is planning
either Saturday or soon afterward to
speak on sectionalism, Mexico and
the problems caused by the European
war.
Withdraw From Non-Partisan Ticket.
E. B. Conner notified the county
auditor Tuesday that he would not
accept the nomination as sheriff on
the Non-Partisan ticket. Conner was
defeated in the primaries for the Re
publication nomination, but his name
was written in on the Non-Partisan
ballots. Elvie B. Page also formally
withdrew as a candidate for repre
sentative for which she had regularly
filed and from which she had at
tempted to withdraw before the pri
maries. (
CANNERY'S OUTPUT
THIS YEAR LARGE
PACK WILL TOTAL 60,000 CASES
OF AVERAGE VALVE OF
«3 EACH.
Some 60,000 cases in all of rasp
berries, loganberries, pears, peaches,
huckeberries, prunes, apples and
plums, at an average value of $3 per
case, will compose the total output
this season of the local plant of the
National Canning company, which is
just now finishing up the largest
pack of pears it has ever made, ac
cording to Mark Ewald, manager.
Incidentally, the plant will be a
permanent feature of the city's in
dustrial life, the planß of the com
pany which prompted it to closo the
plant temporarily early last summer
having been entirely changed, Man
ager Ewald says. The plant will op
erate the present season until about
December 10th, and will resume
again next spring when the straw
berries come on the market. The
company's new plant at Seattle is
also being operated.
The plant has been operating at
capacity all summer, employing some
150 women daily at an average total
daily payroll of from $250 to S3OO.
Its pack this year will equal that of
1915, though it did not start opera
tions until considerably later in the
season, the raspberry and loganberry
pack being practically the same as
last year.
The cannery is just finishing up on
19 carloads of pears and three car
loads of peaches. Last year it han
dled 16 carloads of pears. Both fig
ures are in addition to the local crop
purchased. It is getting ready now
to can huckleberries, prunes and
plums, all of which will be pur
chased from the farmers of the terri
tory immediately surrounding Olym
pia and the nearby islands.
Three boats make regjlar trips to
the various points on the islands,
and the farmers of those districts,
realizing they have a steady market
for berries and fruits of all kinds at
the local cannery, are setting out
more. This traffic In berries brings
considerable other trade to the city,
as the money paid the growers for
their fruits is spent here for supplies.
Formerly this trade went to Tacoma.
Manager Mark Ewald of the local
cannery states that his firm has just
entered into a five-year contract with
C. H. Hawson, a farmer of the Pleas
ant Glade neighborhood, for the en
tire crop of five acres of Wilson and
Clark Seedling strawberries. Mana
ger Ewald reports that Mr. Hawson
netted $360 this year off one acre of
these berries, which led him to make
the five-year contract for the larger
i tract.

"HEW TO THE LINE; LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MA\."
OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY. SEPTEMBER 29, 191 C I-RIOI- i L CENTS
GOSSIP OF THE POLITICAL CLANS
NOW FOR THE BATTLE OF VOTES. the Republican county ticket, nor is
The clans are assemblfed now for
the fray. The state committeemen,
county chairmen and executive com
mittees have been elected, and the re
spective candidates have had several
sessions among themselves, laying
out the plan of campaign and other
wise getting ready for the five weeks'
contest that will be pretty well under
way next week.
Efforts of the Republicans to get
two opposition tickets into the county
field this fall, Democratic and Non
partisan, and to stir up bickerings,
factionalism and division in the ranks
of those who supported the Non
partisan ticket two years ago, have
failed miserably. What the Repub
licans wanted is plain, of course—a
divided opposition this fall would
have insured success for their county
ticket, where the wisest among them
are willing to admit even now that a
united opposition with all the ele
ments entering into it makes the out
look for several at least of their can
didates mighty dubious.
Their efforts to stir up strife in the
opposition failed, but they did suc
ceed in getting some strife going in
their own ranks, and the Republican
forces in this county are more badly
spit today than they have been for
years. All this inures to the benefit
of the Non-Partisan ticket, of course,
and adds greatly to its prospects for
success in November. Certainly the
outlook for it is much better than it
was two years ago, as the material
upon which to conduct the campaign
is much better. And herein lies the
reason for the enthusiasm of the
movement and the confidence of It,
for thofte championing it are confi
dent, far more confident, than they
were two years ago. when their cam
paign resulted in the election of three
candidates.
THE FIERCEST PART OF THE
SCRAP.
From all appearances now the cam
paign will center around two offices,
those of county auditor and of prose
cuting attorney. That is to say, the
fight will wage hardest in respect to
them, the one from the fact that two
women are vying for electioq, the
other from the significant situation
created by a prosecuting attorney
running for re-election against the
candidate whom he defeated two
years ago.
, At the last election Miss Annie Gas
ton led the entire field of successful
candidates in the number of votes
cast for her, but this same Annie
Gaston received less votes In the pri
mary the other day than either Clark
V. Savidge or Fred W. Stocking, who
like her had no opposition. Wherein
lies a story and likewise an indica
tion of what's going to happen In No
vember. For Annie Gaston is no
longer the most popular nominee on
VOTER'S INSTRUCTIONS
ARE ORDERED CHXNCEO
Attorney General Make* Alterations
Demanded by Dlrew-t Legislation
Supporters.
Whether Attorney General Tanner
got his metaphors mixed, or instruc
tions went wrong somewhere along
the line from the state's legal depart
ment and secretary of state's office to
the printer, has not been determined,
but changes have been made in the
secretary's instructions to voters on
the referendums that are satisfactory
to the direct legislation supporters,
represented by H. L. Hughes, and In
junction proceedings started in the
local courts the latter part of last
week have been dropped.
The following alterations were
agreed to at a conference between
Hughes and Attorney General Tan
ner:
For the line. "Proposed to the peo
ple by referendum petition," substi
tute, "Passed by the legislature and
ordered referred by petitions."
For the line, "To sustain the legis
lative act vote "for." is substituted,
"For referendum measure No. —."
The objectionable captions were In
cluded in the pamphlet of direct leg
islation measures issued by the sec
retary of state, from which Hughes
inferred that the ballot was to be ar
ranged in the same manner, and
speedy action for injunction followed.
she the popular official she gave
promise of being two years ago.
The reasons for this decline in her
popularity, the faults to be found
with her conduct of her office, will be
developed as the campaign progress
es. Being a woman and a likable one
personally, she is less open to attack
than if a man were running for re
election on the record she has made.
Certainly there are features of it open
to the severest criticism, and in the
natural course of events as they trans
pire in a political campaign, such crit
icism will be made.
INTRODUCING MISS MARGARET
SHAW.
Opposing her on the Non-Partisan
ticket is Miss Margaret Shaw, an
employe of a local abstract office for
the last six years, in which work she!
has gained an enviable reputation
for promptness, activity, reliability
and capability. Furthermore she
has had an ideal training for the
office she seeks, for the very nature'
of her work as an employe of the ab-!
stract company has given her a thor
ough knowledge of the deed and
mortgage records of the auditor's of
fice, one of the most important feat
ures of its work if not the most im
portant, while her constant presence
in the office in connection with her
work, has given her an insight into
its other phases.
Though the county campaign is
hardly under way, Miss Shaw has
friends in' all parts of the county who
have been working in her behalf ever
since she filed for the nomination on
the Non-Partisaij ticket. Two uncles
of hers, Isaac and Frank Smith, are
farmers in the Lacey district, while
a brother-in-law, Milo Drake, has
been a patternmaker at the Capital
City Iron Works for years. Her
uncles at one time rented the 800-
acre ranch near Yelm known as the
Frank Capen place, and she has a
wide acquaintance in that neighbor
hood, gained while visiting them.
If she is elected auditor, Miss
Shaw, basing her assertion on her
knowledge of the office gained during
j the past six years, proposes to chop
lat least one deputy off the payroll,
| meaning a saving of from SBOO to
S9OO a year. She proposes to expe
! dite the work of the office, to keep
the records up to date instead of let
ting them drag for from three to six
months or longer, and to conduct the
department in a systematic, business
like manner.
A full and detailed statement of
1 the reforms Miss Shaw proposes to
| make in the conduct of the auditor's
| office if she is elected, effecting an
important saving in the cost of its
operation, will be forthcoming short
ly. Suffice it for the present to say

JIM HAM LEWIS IN
SEATTLE TONIGHT
FORMER WASHINGTONIAN TO
OPEN DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN
IN THIS STATE.
Senator James Hamilton Lewis of
Illinois, a former resident of this
state and one of its congressmen 20
years ago, who is touring the state
this wek in the interests of the cam
paign to re-elect President Wilson,
will be the principal speaker at a big
rally to be held at the Arena in Se
attle Friday evening. Quite a num
ber of local Democrats plan to attend
the gathering.
Senator Lewis was tendered a
hearty reception of a non-partisan
character when he arrived in Seattle
Thursday, arranged by many per
sonal friends who recalled with
pleasure a friendship that began more
than 30 years ago, when Senator
Lewis made his debut in Seattle, then
a young lawyer. A feature of it waa
a lunch in his honor that noon ar
ranged by Judge Frederick Bausman
of the state supreme court.
To Senator Lewis belongs the dis
tinction of achieving renown in the
politics of Washington, including one
term as representative in congress
from this state, 1896 to 1898, and of
duplicating that success, only in a
larger measure, in another state, Il
linois. In the busy 14 years that have
elr.psed since he left Seattle to make
his home in Chicago he has been a
notable figure in the politics of the
Democratic party in state %nd nation,
serving first as corporation counsel of
Chicago, later being the standard
bearer of his party in a gubernatorial
fight, and, since 1912, representing
Illinois in the senate of the United
States.
The appearance of Senator Lewis
at the Arena on Friday evening,
coupled with the meeting of the
Democratic state central committee
for the purpose of organization on
Friday afternoon at the Hotel Butler,
will mark the official opening of the
Democratic campaign in the state of
Washington.

WHOLE NUMBER 2927
REPUBLICANS BOOST
STATE'S TAX LEVY
1M T THROUGH CAMPAIGN MEAS
URE AGAINST IjISTEK ADMIN
ISTRATION.
Slate hous:; rumors to the effect
that the Republicans proposed to in
crease the state tax levy as a cam
paign measure against Governor Lis
ter's administration were substanti
ated when the state board of equal
ization late Wednesday fixed the state
levy at 7.7 mills, seven-tenths of a
mill higher than for the current year.
Six-tenths of the increase Is in the
general fund from which the expens
es of all the departments are paid,
and one-tenth is for schools. An in
crease of about $700,000 in the ap
propriations to be asked of the next
legislature by the different state de
partments and institutions is the re
puted basis for the levy.
Democratic officials of the state
house, particularly those who were
members of the board of equalization
until the last legislature changed its
personnel and gave it over into the
control of Republican officials, con
tend that the increase of six-tenths of
a mill In the general fund levy la un
warranted. Supporting their state
ments by figures, they assert that the
same levy for next year as was made
this year would leave a balance of at
leaf $1,500,000 in the general fund
at th& end of the preseftt biennium,
April 1, 1917.
1.25 Levy Actually Lower..
For the current year the levy/fixed
by a Democratic board last y«»r, has
been 1.25 mills. The levy for next
year, as Just made by a Republican
board, is 1.U6 mills. Because of the
general reductions in property valu-.
ations throughout tlje state this year,
a 1.25 levy tor taext year would have
made the taxes paid actually lower
than this year, though the rate of
levy were the same.
First reports ,H|t o|t By the Re-
Sublican officials whose duty it .is to
t the ItVy Were to the effect that a
2.66 mill Itfvy would txT needed tor
the general fund. b ( ut the rate finally ,
fixed is 1.85; mllil. If £<e original
plan had gone through, the Republi
can hoard of equalisation would hafe
tacked mor6 than a 100 per cent in
crease to the state levy during the
closinf months of Governor Lister's
j the fact that
i on September 22 of this year the state
i general fund showed a balance of sl,-
j 495,494.
In the of 1912, when Hay
'was running f6r re-election-on the
Republican ticket, (ha state board of
fequalization, then likewis4 Republi
can, made a levy of 1% mills, al
though the certainty of an overdraft
on the general fund was assured, as
the fund then contained f balance of
but $149,266 45, according to statis
tics compiled by J. W. Brislawn of
the state tax commission, a member
of the state board of equalization un
. til the last legislature changed its
personnel and gave it into the con
trol of the Republicans. On Oetober
31, 1912, the overdraft developed,
and in January, 1913, when Governor
Lister was inaugurated, it had grown
to $450,000. By April 1, the expira
tion of the last biennial appropriation
made under Hay, the overdraft was
$566,039.
This legacy of overdraft, together
with the high appropriations of the
1913 legislature, imposed a state levy
of 3 mills upon the new administra
tion for 1913. But on April 17, 1914,
the general fund carried a balance of
$726,489, and the increase to the
state's credit has continued steadily,
until it has approximately reached
the $1,500,000 mark, at which point
the board of equalization fixes a levy
six-tenths of a mill more than the
levy fixed when a heavy overdraft
had to be met.
Fallacy of Action.
The fallacy of this action, accord
ing to Commissioner Brislawn's de
ductions, lies in basing the estimate
of what the new levy should be on
an estimate showing that the 1917
legislature vMI appropriate nearly
$1,000,000 more from the general
fund than Vd the legislature of 1915.
In this the fact >as beon overlooked
that the levy mrde Mils year is for
