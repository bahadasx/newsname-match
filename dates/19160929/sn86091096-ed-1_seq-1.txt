NUMBER 39
Conditions in The Potlatch
Rev. George Finke, former mem
ber of the Idaho legislature and a
resident of the Potlatch country for
many years, is a visitor in the city
from his home at Cameron. Mr.
Finke stated the grain threshing is
practically completed in the Pot
latch country and the farmers se
cured good crops. He said about
..one-third of the beans have been
threshed, about one-third of the
crop is in piles on the ground and
the remaining one-third is uncut.
The threshing of the beans has
been stopped by the heavy rain
Monday but threshing can be re
sumed in a few days unless more
rain is experienced. He said the
crop could stand considerable rain
without damage but because of tne
lateness of the season, the farmers
are considerably worried over the
threatening weather. The crop is
now being contracted at five cents
per pound, which means the grow
ers will receive handsome profits
from their bean crops.
"The growing of Alsike clover
for seed has been introduced with
wonderful success," said Mr. Finke,
"and it is quite probable a large
acreage of this clover will be seeded
next season. Clover is regarded as
one of the best crops for restoring
the fertility to the soil and the
claim is made that grain will not
smut on land upon which clover has
been grown.
"Edward Pompe, a resident of
the Cameron section, seeded 40
acres to Alsike clover last year and
this year he sold his crop of clover
seed for $2,400 or an average of
$60 per acre, Edward Gertje real
ized the same price per acre from
a 20-acre crop so it is evident the
results attained by Mr. Pompe are
possible in other sections of the
Potlatch country.
"The growing of clover for seed
represents much less labor and ex
John Imthurn of Juliaetta grew
12,000 pounds of string beans
which he sold to the cannery this
summer. He intends to plant a
much larger acreage next year as
he made good money on the crop
this» season. He brought in eight
different varieties of beans to the
Kendrick Fair.

Atter a waimumt campaign the Republicans made a clean sweep of practically every ointe on the ticket in Maine; Carl E.
Milliken won governorship and Colonel Frederick Hale a senatorship. Again the allies commenced activities on all fronts; Bul
gar trenches were rushed; Carpathian points stormed, while on the Somme front the French under General Foch made wide
sweep on four mile front. Chick Evans won national amateur golf championship and R. Norris Williams recaptured his title
of tennis champion. Motorboat "mosquito" fleet figured in naval preparedness maneuvers. New York for the second time in a month found itself harassed
by a traction strike; motormen on the subway, "L" and surface cars were protected by wire screens. Though driven fast on the rocks at Santo Domingo
City, the cruiser Memphis may yet be saved from total loss. Artist Ralpb A. Blakelock of New York, now world famous, gets six months to prove sanity.

A LI« COUR SE Of B CEPIIOHIL MERIT
Consists of Four Numbers And a School Entertainment
First Number October 24th.
felt
The Kendrick Lyceum Course,
given this year under the auspices
of the Commercial Club, will con
sist of four concerts and entertain
ments of exceptional merit and one
high class popular lecture. The
patronage given the course last
year has made it possible to- offer a
bigger and better course than ever !
before. In fact it is believed that
the people of Kendrick and vicinity
are offered this year a far better
course for the money than can be
had in any town of the same size
in this part of the country. The
course will be furnished by the
Ellison-White Lyceum Bureau of
Boise and is as follows:
1. Kekuku's Hawaiian Quintet,
Oct. 24th.
2. The Criterion Glee Club, Dec.
5th.
3. Lyndon-Gordon Co., Feb. 9th.
4. School Entertainment, (Date
undecided.)
5. Dr. Robert Sutcliffe, Mar. 9th.
The opening number will be
given bv Kekuku's Hawaiin Quin
tet, an organization of singers and
players which has scored a huge
success in all of the large cities.
The most beautiful and soothing
music is brought to us from the
Island of the Pacific and to many
the instrumental and vocal music
of the Hawaiins is by far the sweet
est. Hawaiian music by these
native singers and players has been
a great success in America because
it is different. The melodious
strains of the songs and the accom
paniment on native instruments,
with the peculiar sliding of the fin
gers on the strings, is plaintive and
fascinating. The guitar solos by
Mr. Kekuku are most wonderful
and Mr. July is said to possess the
most beautiful tenor voice in
Hawaii. Mr. Kekuku has appeared
in the one hundred and twenty-five
largest cities of America. Over
one million people have heard him
play. It is not uncommon for Mr.
Kekuku to play five encore numbers
for each regular selection presented

His audiences seem never to tire of
the beautiful music.
The Criterion Glee Club has made
an enviable reputation upon the
concert platform. It is composed
of four men, with beautiful solo
voices which blend perfectly. With
the aid of Mr. Grover's crayon
sketches and cartoons, and Mr.
Wood's çharacter songs, they pre
sent a program full of variety and
unusually attractive. Mr. Wood
is known as "The funny man."

crowds at the New Alcazor Theatre
last evening. Such a Quartette as
the Criterions has rarely been heard
Each member has a
voice of wonderful depth and clar

The Lyndon-Gordon Co. gives a
program of music, readings and in
personations. The following testi
monial of their work needs no fur

girls who looked like a thousand
others but they were alive. The

days. Miss Gordon ran the gamut
in dialect impersonations-She was'
the Melting Pot of the Nations in
one personality—and I apologized
to myself for not having heard of
this astonishing artist before.
Every time I think of that perfor
mance my ribs ache. With a prc
gram at once novel, delightful, in
teresting. diversified, I will stake
the reputation of the Lyceum Bu
reau in sajing that these talented
young women are destined to thrill
others just as they thrilled me."
Dr. Sutcliffe will deliver a popu
lar lecture which never fails to
please. Before entering the Ly
ceum, Dr. Sutcliffe was in charge
of one of the largest mission halls
in London where he lectured to the
largest audiences assembling in the
city at that time. The following
comment is clipped from the Idaho
Falls Register: "Dr. Sutcliffe has
made a deep impression on Idaho
Falls with his lectures and every
body will look forward to a return
visit. We have been indeed for
tunate in securing Dr. Sutcliffe to
lecture for us and it is the opinion
of everyone who has heard him that
he stands head and shoulders over
all others in his line of work."
The fifth number in the course
will be an entertainment given by
the Kendrick schools. Season
tickets are now on sale for the en
tire series at $2.00 for adults and
$1.00 for all pupils in the high
school and grades. This makes the
average price for the five numbers
unusually low. The Hawaiians

Good Price for Lambs
I. E. Foster of Linden brought
29 head of lambs to market Mon
day for which he received five and
a half cents a pound. Mr. Foster
figures that the wool clip paid all
the expense in connection with
keeping the lambs and the price
received was clear profit. He has
some waste land on his place which
makes first class sheep range and
brings him good returns.

The most abject apologies from

work outside the office in connec

possible for ye editor to spend
much time on the paper. Be leni

The lecture by Miss Hoover, of
the Economics Department of the
University of Idaho, given in the
pavilion Wednesday afternoon, was
intensely interesting. Her subject
was "The Balanced Meal" and the
information and illustrations she
gave her hearers showed she posses

subject.
Frank A. Clark, democratic can

Mrs. J. S. Vincent of Lewiston
