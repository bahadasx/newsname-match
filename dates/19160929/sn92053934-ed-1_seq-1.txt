Referring to Rumania, the hancel- j

King of Aces
Drops Three
Enemy Aer os
Taris, Sept. 29, (5:15 a. m.) Three
German aeroplanes brought down in
two minutes and thirty seconds by a
ptop watch 1s the latest exploit of
Second Lieutenant Georges Guynemer.
Incidentally Lieutenant Guynemer,
who is known as "king of .the aces,"
fell 10,000 feet hut escaped unhurt.
Guynemer went to the assistance of
a comrade who was hard pressed by
five German machines. He brought
down two of them within thirty sec
ands and then rising overtook a third
which he shot down two minutes lat
er. He was looking for the remain
ing two German machines when a
shell burst beneath him and stripped
the left wing of his aeroplane of every
stitch of its covering. He plunged gid
dily earthward.
"I pave mvsolf up for lost." he said.
"but after falling f,ft0O feet I thought
I would struggle all the same. The
wind blew me over our lines. I con
tinned t fall and the levers wouldn't
budge. Ami then I saw the field toward
which I was dashing down. Suddenly
something happened and my speed
diminished. Then there was a re
sounding crash and a violent, shock.
When I recovered my wits. I was in tho
midst of the fragments of my machine
and practically uninjured. How am I
I still alive, I asked myself. I believe
it was tho ptraps which held me to my
seat which saved me."
On Sept. If! Lieutenant Guynemer
was officially credited with his lfith
enemy aeroplane. A week Inter he
was reported to have brought down his
17th and lth. He was wounded in a
right in the air last March and in a
subsequent flight was forced to de-
! scend between the French and Ger
i man trenches but escaped.

named Cossart.
He wired for further details, and to

LIFE DECLARES FOR
PRESIDENT WILSON
New York, Sept. 29. Life, the fear
less, talented and clever oracle of so-!
ciety, once an unsympathetic critic of
! President Wilson, has seen the light.
In the current issue it ventures the
oninion that Mr. Wilson is the great-
j est American progressive since Thom
as Jefferson. It says: "He is perfectly
willing to use the rich to beat riches
and aristocracy."
"Jefferson fought the federalists, in
cluding most of the rich and respect
able people in the country; Jackson
fought the United States bank; Lin
coln fought the slave-holding aris
tocracy and its allies; Roosevelt
fought here and there the trusts, the
railroads, the bankers, off and on, but
1 Roosevelt is an aristocrat and has
compassionate bowels for his own
kind.
"But Mr. Wilson is not an aristo
crat. He has fought, according to his
lights, against the exploitation of the
bodies and energies of the common
people to defend the interests and in
vestment of the prosperous. At the
start he would not fight to defend
American investors; he would not take
sides with Rockefeller in the Colorado
strike; he helped reduce the tariff; he
alleviated the domination of the money
trust; he would not get us into the war
even after the Lusitania, though he
did risk doing so, and though all 'so
ciety' wanted to get in, and he would
not side with the railroads against the
brotherhoods.
' This man is for the mass of the
people. He really is a great demo
crat. He is a good hand to nip the
tariff cobra, the banking adder, the
railroad boa constrictor, when that is
necessary. It is his nature to fight
these creatures. It was not Roose
velt's nature to fight them. He could
slash around among them on occa
sions, hut he enjoyed their society.
His notion of government was always
government by aristocrats."

GARRANZA EDICT
HOLDSMIf
Puts Owners In Position to Consider
Them Only Renters With 3Iexico
the Jeal Proprietor.
El Paso, Sert. 29. "Private owner
ship of miner.vl property in Mexico is,
in fact, nothing more than a species of
rent of the subsoil, for which the
title holder has to pay the nation, the
true propri-.tor of the subsoil."
This extract from a public state
ment by Mexico's secretary of finance,
received here today by the Mexican
consulate, presents the official attitude
of the Carranza government toward
owners of Mexican mines whether
Mexicans or foreigners.
The statement is issued in defense
of Carranza's decree of May 1 of this
year which, under penalty of confis
cation, lays imposts and working con
ditions on the mines that have caused
foreign owners to make strong repre
sentations to their home governments.
These complaints have been carried to
New London where the joint commis-
j sion is sitting.
The statement makes clear tnat tne
Carranza government will not consid
er special pleas to escape the effects
of the decree and adds that the title
to mineral lands does not grant an ab
solute right, "but a limited prprietor
ship revertible to the state."
ThB theory of the law. according to
; the statement, is that title is condi-
i tional on the payment of imposts or
merely "grants ot privilege to exptoit
land which primarily belongs to the
nation."
Annullment of title is excused as the
only efficacious way of dealing with
owners who fail to comply with the
decree or to operate their holding.
CONTRIBUTIONS TO

mediately. During the last week there have

MORE DETAILS OF
IOWA PLOT GIVEN
JIanner In Which Scheme Was Operat
ed to Get $I5,(XK from Rich
Iowan Is Told.
Chicago, Sept. 29. Additional details
of a scheme whereby a wealthy Iowan,
referred to as "a leading citizen of his
community," was compelled to pay
$15,000 to a band of so-called Mann act
blackmailers became known here to
day when II. G. Clabaugh, investigator
for the department of Justice, prepared
to hold a conference with C. E. Whee
ler and W. N. Jay. attorneys for the
Iowa victim and one of the two girls
alleged to have been the "lures" in this
case.
The Iowan, it is said, was introduced
to one of tho "lures" by a client in his
home townwho said she was the girl'8
aunt. Later he came to Chicago alone
and visited the apartment at which the
girl he had met in Iowa lived with an
other girl. While the girls were show
ing him through the flat, the bell rang
and in going to answer it one of the
girls locked the Iowan and the other
girl in a bedroom.
The visitors, two men. proclaimed
themselves lawyer and detective, re
spectively and accused the Iowan of
violating the Mann act. Under the
combined pressure of the girls and the
two men the former pleading that he
save them from shame and threatening
publicity the Iowan paid the men $300
on tho spot. Followed to his home
town and again threatened with "ex
posure" the victim paid the gang $4,500
more in cash and $10,000 more in notes.
The "lures" and their accomplices
took a trip to California and upon their
return were betrayed to federal au
thorities by the abandoned wire of onj
of the men.
