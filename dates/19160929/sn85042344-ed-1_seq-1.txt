Hot urged Republican senators to
filibuster against the bill was made
the occasion of M Hughes' declara
tu.n. He mild:
"A distinguish'?!! Democrat, a
foimer secretary of state, Mr Olncy,
whom I have always adniired and
respetrd and whose record presents
a singular contrast to that of the
1 resent administration, springs to Its
defonje !n Its hour of tnul. With
Me ability I assume he done tho best
that can be done.
"Me says, referring to the recent
railroad situation, that I object not to
the averted strike, but to the mode of
Its ho oinpllshniont to wit: by the
threat of a strike within a time too
short for due consideration of neces
sary legislation. I am not prepared to
admit the necessity of wage Increases
by luw, but I do object 111 every fiber
of my being to legislation under du
ress. I object to the surrender of the
executive to force. That Is the path
of disaster. If tho distinguished for
mer secretary of state desires to take
tho nation aiong that path I will not
accompany mm.
AgninM Filibustering.
"He asks why I did not urge 28
republican senators to filibuster to
the last ditch. Well, I do not believe
In filibustering for one thing. If con
gress through Itminujnrtty was deter
mined to pass the bill there was no
reuson whatever why Its action should
be merely delayed by filibustering. Ar
guments along this line really come to
this: TliHt In somo way the admin
istration should have been saved from
Itself.
"Tho truth is that tho executive de
stroyed tho moral strength of the
situation when he threw up his hands,
yielded tho principle of arbitration
and went to congress demanding the
railway wage hill as the prlco of peace.
Congress so far as the moral of the
of the situation was concerned, rati
fied a surrender already made. The
administration chose its ground; It se
lected Its ground carefully and with
mnnlfest view to partisan expediency.
In the closing days It anted with
swifiness and It cannot now cry thut
a Republican candidate a thousand
miles away should have saved It from
carrying out Its fixed determination."

Mr. Hughes' citation from Presldem
Wilson's address to congress was a
brief one. The part quoted followed
the president'! declaration that "I
yield to no man In firm adherence
like of conviction and of purpose to
the principle of arbitration In Indus
trial disputes" and was a part of the
same sentence, which was as follows:
"But mutters have corns to a sudden
crisis In this particular dispute snd
the oountry has been caught unpro
vided with any practicable means of
enforcing that conviction in practice,
by whose fault we will not now stop
to Inquire."

Proceed to Line for
Active Service.
TCLHA'S second gift to the nution's
military sorvlce will leave for tho
.Mexican border tonight. The First
ambulance company, Tulsa, attached
to the troops under the command of
General Fred Funston, will be in
spected and sworn into tho service
today by Captain Machlson of the
inspector ge.nernl's hea.diuartere In
San Antonio, who will arrlvo In this
city at 8 o'clock this morning for that
purpose.
Captain H. O. IaReau, command
ing the unit, was Informed yesterday
urternoon that orders had been re
ceived to nropare for the final Inspec
tion and the mustering in ceremonies,
which are scheduled to occur in tho
hall of the Knights of Columbus, on
Boulder between Fourth and. Fifth.
"We expect to consume the greater
port of the day In having the men of
tho unit mustered In and lmpoctd,
was the captain's expression last night.
"We believe that all of the men on
the roster as It now stands will pass
the Inspection. This will give, us
margin of at least forty men above
the required war strength.
"We are of the opinion at this timo
that the unit will go at once to tho
border and as we have been Informtd
that such an organization as this it;
to render aid to a hmly of men approx
imately eirht thousand ecldlern, we
are also of the opinion that we will
be stationed somewhere nfar the
middle of the line which Is stretched
across the southern part of the coun
try." If the captain Is right in his de
ductions it in probablo that the train
bearing the Tulsa ambulance company
will go directly to Fort Worth or Dal
las over the M , K. T. through Mus
kogee, Mc.Alcster, and to some Texa.-
point from where they will be sent
to the border station designated In
the commands which will come with
transportation orders. At points
along the route delegations are ex
pected to entertain the members of
the unit.

After their arrival on tho bordoir
the quartermaster's department will
make the Issuance of motor anib'i
larnes, of which there oreto be 18,
together with the four automobile
trucks and 4 pack mules. The latter
are for the distribution of medical
supplies In tones In which transpor
tation Is Impossible with the uuto
mobllof. The Tulsa organisation also will
carry as a part of its equipment two
or three field hospitals. These will
be so arranged that by combining
them at a given point captain LaReau
will have all the necessary equipment
for a base hospital, providing quarters
are scoured. As the organization
moves It will carry only the tropical
hospital tents.
Ths men are eager to depart and
to secure clothing allowances, whloh
will be theirs as soon as they are en
listed into the federal service. For
the past ten days they hsve been go
ing through a hard routine of drill
work thut has been hard on their
shoes, and many of them are greatly
In need of clothing.
"we aon't mina that so much
though," said one of ths rookies yes
terday, "but we do mind leaving
Tulsa with a bunch of debts left un
paid. Our officers have paid out all
they felt like paying In keeping us

some bills for feed that have not been

Meanwhile a big battle Is In prog

between Lulsk and Vladimir Volyn

where the Russians are attempting to
advance, but the Teutons are imped
ing them by heavy counter ul tucks. I
The (ierman war office says these
counter utlacks in the region of
Koiynitza have resulted in the recap
ture of positions lost recently by the
Teutons and that tho allied forces
have now passed on beyond them.
Heavy casualties were inflicted on the
Russians, says Herlin, and in addition
41 officers and 2,800 men were taken
prisoner and one cannon and 1J ma

In Oullcia the Oermans west of

and men of tho Teutonic allies have
been made prisoner and six hundred
cannon and 2,600 machine guns and
