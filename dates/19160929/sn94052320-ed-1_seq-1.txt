Aa Argument Against the- UlliaXite
Bill to tatabliah A New Normal
School at Feadktoa, 1
(By S. D. Alien of Eugene, Ore.)
MiaaUtamanta rurardina' th Pen-
dlaton Normal Bill, made to members
of my family and my acquaintances.
oy the circuiaiora ci peruone rr pie
cing tho bill upon the ballot, led me
publicly oppose the bill. I am not
opposed to another Normal School fox
Oregon, I am not even opposed to pia
ang It at rendleton, provided the
jueation of ait ia fairly and honeatly
submitted to th voters, but I am op
posed to thla particular bill and the
methods employed to make it a law.
i am greatly Interested that wrongful
political methods In Oregon should
.mm, and thla Interest alone leada me
to make thl argument.
fh Sluatlon at th Tim the Pcndle
ton Bill Waa Framed.
At the time thla -bill waa framed
Lhara were three educational inatitu-
uona mainUined by the State of Ore
gon, tho University at Eugene, open
ad for Instruction in 1867 and In which
jistruction haa been continuoua for 4
ya&rs, th Agricultural College at
Oorvallia, maintained in continuous
uperation by the state tine 1835, and
iha State Normal at Monmouth, open
sd hi 18S2, and since, with the excep
tion of a few year when no appropri
ation waa made, In continuoua opera
tion. All these are In flourishing con
dition, hav extensive plants, and axe
liberally mipported by permanent,
continuing appropriation. These
three institutions ar named in u
Pndlton Bill and purport to be af
fectedbylt ; ' ' , 8 ; .
From a tlm prior to the establish
ment of the school there wat
clause In th ttata conttitution Mad
ing aa follow i ,
"All public instltutlone of th
atate hereafter provided for by
the leglilaUv assembly shall be
located at the eoat of govern-
AM 1
men. , ' , ,
Thla clause wat not understood at
referring to educational institution
and tha University, the Agricultural
i"..ita and four normal schools were
located away from the capital while
it waa In full force. The clause was
considered by the Stfpreme Court In
the case, ''
SUU ex rel. vs. Metschen, 82 Or. 872.
where that court referring to It says:
"In view of the practical con
struction of the Instrument by
the legislative and executive de
partments for at least if not quite
a quarter of a century, bb evi
denced by the location of educa
tional institution away from tha
teat of fovtrnmtnt U no doubt

cftaracUr, An a. ylum for the in
tune luiues dearly within thw
construction." ,
. Sine the Supreme Court so tpoke
ther hav been 21 year of added
practical construction, in which the
ttate has maintained these Institu
tions away from the aeat of govern
ment If the court in 1886 could say
there waa "no doubt" regarding the
proper construction of this clause,
what man or court should question it
now, even if there haa been no addi
tional legislation affecting the situa
tion T But there has been additional
legislation of the moat decisive character,.-
.. . " "'
At tho 1908 general election, the
people of the state changed thla very
clans to at to read:
"All public institutions of the
atate, not located elaewhere prior
to January, 1907, ahall be located
in the county whera the seat of
government la." .
, For what possible purpose could
th words "not located elsewhere pri
or to January, 1007," have been intro
duced Into thia clause but to effectu
ally silence the claim, sometimes
made, that the educational Institution
ware not legally located t What at
torney would hav th hardihood now
to contend before a court of record
that thla amendment did not accom
plish th purpose so evidently intend
ed? - :- '
But th constitutional change ef
fected tn 1008, ia not all that ha been
don. At th gnral election of 1910
the people, by an initiative bill, pro
vided for the "permanent support ano
mainUnanc" of tie Monmouth Nor-;
mat, by a permanent annual tax upon
all the property uf the state. The
Pendleton bill does not go near to far.
It purports only to validate what has
been done. Thia school was in actual
successful operation, the atate from
year to year enlarging the physical
plant and having, at w have aeen,
made effectual provision for it "per
manent tupporU" Yet it ia reserved
for ambitious rendleton from it po
sition across tha mountains to disco
ver that something wat still legally
wrong with the Monmouth school.
In 1012, by a referendum vote, the
people provided for the erection of
costly permanent buildings for the
University, and they have since been
erected. In 1913, the legislature also
provided for ha support a continuing
annual tax. II ratification of its lo
cation were noedod this supplied it.
Yet it was reserved for the Pendleton
boomors, from their vantage point
tgroM the. Cateadca, to disjsvw that
ker at ' v
! somathlng waa legally wrong with the
University, and generously to proceed
to corm-t the wrong.
la lik manner the legislature of
1913, provided for the support of the
Agricultural College by a permanent
continuing tax. 1 do not recall any
act of 'popular legjdatkm ratifying
the location of the Agricultural Col
lege, but there ar facta, obvious to
any thoughtful mind, that have made
tho location of tho Agricultural Col
lege permanent at Corvalli for be
yond what could be done through pop
ular or represanUUva legislation.
Here is a great atate farm, highly de
veloped, and a costly, well piauned
agricultural school, whoa reputation
extends for beyond the limits of the
state, lb location of such an Insti
tution must neceeaarily be rural. Am
bitious citiee may not bid for it loca
tion. No salt mun can Imagine a
popular frenzy that would bring about
ihe removal and consequent oca true
uon, of thia megniheent plant. The
framer of th fandleton bill did not
anticipate any such reault. They did
not anticipate; that support would be
denied the Agricultural College be
es u of any supposed invalidity In
1U location. O, no! They were too
smart for that They brought the
Agricultural College within their bill
lor a far different purpose. -

KetabUah a New Normal At Pea

of Their Measure Threa Ex-
. letiag Iastilutiooa Lang Es- ;
tabdahed and Permanent-
ly Provided Fort
The answer to this question it not
diflurult . of solution. The inclusion
bait I kcro. By it they
expected to win th t-nthinking aiu
uninformed friends of these existing
institutions and get votes that on the
traigbt proposition to establish a
new normal could not bo had On the
straight proposition th framer s bad
reason to expect defeat for their mea
sure. ..In J914-, initiativa nwasuret to
reestablkh normal work at the Asn
iand and Weston Normals had both
been defeated. Tiroes are now tard
er and tax burdens weigh more heav
Uy. The f ramera of the measure rea-
,ized that a straigat measure to es
tablish a new normal at Pendleton
would fail. They thought to throw a
scare into the friends of the three ex
isting institutions and so get their
votes. Tha intimation was to be made
general that these three institutions
were rot legally established, that their
maintenance waa imperiled, but that
thia new bill would give them a per
manent, legal status. I know perso
nally that thia claim waa extonsivo-
y made here in Eugen to get aigna-
and his thigh and leg mangled by the
lures to th initiative petitions, and I
know that signatures were obtained
on tho strength of it

longer 01. this delightful phas of the
subject What a pity it waa that
Ashland and Weston, when they
thought to re-establish work in their
normals, confined their billa to a single
issue, when, possibly, by combining
with several other interest they
might hav won!
III. '
Can The Frienda of The Three Exist
ing Institutions Safely Vote
For Thia Bill?
It was an alleged educational com
bine that several years ago led to the
defeat of all appropriations for the
four normals. I do not know that
there was really such a combination
but I do know that this bill taken in
connection with some of the people
who are championing it has a very
suSfelcioua look. The experience of
the four normals in 1909, ought not
to be forgotten.
Let ua see what this bill really does,
if it becomes a law. The state has a
normal school plant at Weston, 21
miles from Pendleton. Th sit has
ten acres. Ther is a three story and
basement main school building, a
boarding hall for young women, a
men's dormitory, a gymnasium, a pre
sident's house. Owing to a lack of
aDDronriation no instruction has been

At a meeting of citizens Monday

stat haa not in any way intimated
that it will not in due time resume
normal work there." The state could
not be supposed to maintain two nor
mals within twenty mile of each oth
er. This but meana t&e removal 01
the Eastern Oregon Normal from
Weston to Pendleton. Precisely the
sam arguments ar vsed in support
of this proposition that have been us
ed for the removal of the State Uni-
vorsitv to Portland, that were in fact
used in a nublie meeting in Portland
during the summer just passed when
resolutions wer passed looking to tn
present removal of portion or th
University to Portland. Western Re
serve University had a far larger
nlant than that at Monmouth, one that
perhaps might even be compared to
that of the Oregon University, wnen
Cleveland through gifta of land and
money secured its , removal to that
city. True, wat was not a stato in
stitution, but the same golden argu
ments that win boards of trustees may
win th general public. It seems to
ma that it ia imnrudent for t&e mends
of existing institutions to line up with
amhitioua cities in establishing a pre
cedent for school removals.1 ,
And finally, a miasur for the es
tablishment of a school should be free
from all taint of wrongful political
methods. ! "Log-rolling", "pork",
'fomhinatlon of interest", these are
hateful words when applied to any
subject of legislation, but they are
ahaolutalv abhorrent when used in
connection with th establishing of
public education. Tha finger OI scorn
amnid ritrhtlv colnt to a normal se
cured by methods that could be so
characterised. If it is right to estab
lish a new normal in Pendleton by
popular vote 1st that proposition be
niKmitted on its own merits and freed
from all subjects that would tend to
secure votes that are really again
