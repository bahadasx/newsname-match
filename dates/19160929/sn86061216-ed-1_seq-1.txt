ARM0REDTANK
NEAR CAPTURE
BRITISH WAR INVENTION START8
OUT FOR BERLIN BUT RUNS
SHORT ON FUEL.
British Front in France, Sept. 27—
(Via London, Sept 28)—In the lull
which has occurred after the great
two days' battle, In which five villages
and 5,000 prisoners were taken by the
allies, the correspondent of The Asso
ciated Press has had an opportunity
to glean many stories from partici
pants in the struggle.
The most wonderful of all the tales
told was perhaps that of one of the
tanks, or new armored motor cars,
which started for Berlin on its own ac
count. This monstrouB land ship, am
bling and rumbling along, did not wait
on the infantry after the taking of
Gueudecourt but plodded over shell
boles and across lots looking for Its
prey like some prehistoric lizard. It
found a German trench but as It en
gaged the occupants with Its machine
gun it ran out of gasoline.
When the Germans found this
strange creature, with its steel hide
Impenetrable to bullfetB, stalled, curi
osity and a desire for revenge was a
fillip to their courage. They went af
ter it T^ith avidity.
British officers say that while the
tank's machine gun blazed right and
left some of the Germans managed to
creep along the trenches under the
forelegs and hlndlegs of the crouching
beast. Then they swarmed over it
looking for an opening through which
over but to no avail. All the while the
tank's machine guns kept busy at the
human targets In reach while Its crew,
chosen daredevils, concluded to Btick
until they starved or the Germans got
them out
Finally the British infantry in the
rear, seeing the tank in distress, with
a cheer rushed the Germans and over
whelmed them.
The taking of Thiepval and the Zol
lern redoubt, which lies between It and
Courcelette, was a wonderful business.
Thiepval was held by the one hundred
and eightieth German regiment. Ac
cording to prisoners, the defenders
had fortified the commanding ridge
with an amazing series of ramified
tunnels and dugouts. The men of the
hundred and eightieth asked permis
sion to remain in Thiepval, giving tl)eir
word that it would never be taken
from them and the German army com
mander consented.
And, for the most part, it was taken
over their dead bodies.
