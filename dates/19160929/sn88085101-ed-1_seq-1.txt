DEATH OF MRS> JONH BOYD.
A number of the friends of the fam
ily received cards in Monday night’s
mail conveying the sad announcement
of the death of Mrs. Bella Boyd, wife
of John Bovd, which occured at New
York City, September 3. 1916. There
were no particulars beyond the brief
statement of facts. All of the old resi
dents of Loomis remember Mrs. Boyd
with most kindly feelings, as she spen
a number of years of her life in that
place, and the news of her death was
received with sincere expressions of
sorrow and regret. Mrs. Boyd moved

During her residence in Loomis Mrs.
Boyi made friends of all with whom

sympathetic neighbor. The sympathy

“micted husband and daughter at this
time of their grevlous loss.

OROVILLE, WASHIN 4TON. SEPTEMBER 29, 1916
PROIiIIiITIVE FREIGHT KATES.
Some weks ago the Gazette denied a
statement appearing in the Wenatchee
World to the effect that a prohibitive
freight rate bud been made by trans
portation companies on Epsom salts.
That denial was made on the authority
of a statment from the manager of the
local salts works, it seeming a mon
strous proposition that railroads would
combine to put out of business an in
stitution that was aiding to develop
one of the natural resources of the
country, it is now evident that the
World was better informed than the
local manager of the salts works, and
it can no longer be denied that the
railroads have raised the freight rates
on Epsom salts from Orovllle to the
eastern markets to a most exhorbitant
figure, a figure that is a death blow to
the local Industry. The rate has been
raised from 50 cents per hundred to
|1.20 per hundred, and as salts are
quoted at only $1.20 on the eastern
market the new rate, it enforced,
means the closing down of the local
plant. Indeed, Mr. Cronin, the local
manager, has on hand three cars of
salts to ship to the coast market, one
to Spokane, one to Seattle and one to
Portland, and If he does not receive in
structions to the contrary he will be '
compelled to discharge his force and ;
close down the works, thus throwing
a number of men out of steady employ
ment, and putting an end to an indus
try that has been Instrumental in plac
ing In circulation In this community a
large sum of money during the past
year.
Strong appeals have been made to
the railroad commission in an effort to
secure some relief by the restoration
of the old rate, or at least a rate that
would leave some margin of profit to
the western operator. The Orovllle
Commercial club and other oganiza
tlons of like kind have entered strong
protests against this killing off of an
infant yet promising industry, yet up
to the present time those appeals have
met with no favorable response. Sen
ators and congressmen have also been
solicited to use their influence In se
curing relief, and no doubt these gen
tlemen are doing all In their power to
find a remedy.
Unfortunate will it be for the town
and country if an arbitrary freight rate
should result in permanently suspend
ing production at the Oroville salts
works. Why this step was taken by the
railroads is not known, and the natural
inference to be drawn Is that eastern
producers with an inside pull hate
succeeded in Inducing a radical in
crease in freight rates on this particu
lar product In order to strangle a wes
tern competitor. The company operat
ing at Oroville has spent a large sum
of money putting up necessary build
ings, Installing machinery for evap
orating and handling the remarkable
natural deposit, paying royalties and
salaries, and it would seem that such
enterprise should be encouraged in ev
ery way by the transportation lines
over which the finished product seeks
a market. Suspension of operations at
the salis works will be sorely felt here
as it means the cutting off of a con
siderable pay roll.

A CHANGE OF RESIDENCE.
Tuesday morning Mrs. L. L. Work
accompanied by her daughter Miss
Carol, departed for Lincoln, Neb.,
where she will visit with relatives for
several weeks. This is the first stage of
a journey to the Atlantic seaboard,
where the Work family will take up
their residence and expect to make
their future home. Mrs. Work and
daughter will be joined by Mr. Work
and son Kenneth in November, when
they will all continue on to their final
destination. The departure of Mrs.
Work is the removal from the commu
nity ot a most estimable lady who is
held In the highest esteem and affec
tion by a large number of old and
warm friends, not only In Oroville, but
throughout the entire county. She liv
ed for years in Conconully and Oroville
and she breaks away from pleasant as
sociations that will cling to memoiy
throughout her life. Mrs. Work will be
sadly missed in social and church cir
cles, and all who khow her, while de
ploring her departure, trust she will
find her new home a happy and con
genial one.

LYCEUM ENTERTAINMENT.
A number of business and profes
sional men of Orovllle subscribed some
weeks ago for a series of entertain
ments to be given under the direction
of the Midland Lyceum Bureau of Des
Moines, lowa. There were to be five
numbers, made up of lectures, read
ings and musical renditions, presented
by men and women of nation wide rep
utation. The object of subscribing for
the course was to insure some first
class entertainment for the people of
the town and vicinity, and we feel safe
in promising that that is what the sub
scribers have coming. The first number
of the series is billed at the Orpheum
theatre for next Monday evening, and
the attraction is Arthur Kachel, a play
reader, who comes highly recommend
ed us an artist in his line, if be is one
half as good as his letters of commen
dation promise, then the people of Oro
ville have such a treat before them as
they have never before had an oppor
tunity to enjoy.

thern railroad arrived from Seattle

continuing down the branch to We
natchee. The travelers had only a short
time to spend in Oroville. They looked
over the business section and express

Robinson and Alexander Qaden. The
Orpheum has been putting on a high
c'ass line of pictures this summer, and
the one for Saturday and Sunday
evenings is equal to the best heretofore
exhibited. Besides this thrilling drama
there will be the regular Keystone
comedy, wh : ch In itself is wortc the

within the past few weeks.
A BIG LAND DEAL.
During the past week Dell Hart ne
gotiated one of the largest and moat
Important real estate deals that baa
ever taken place In the county, both
from the acreage Involved and the
amount of money required to awing the
transfer. The property that changed
hands with this sale and purchase are
the Vie Champneys ranch, owned by
T. L, Irwin, who bought It from V. W.
Champneys last winter, and the A 1
Riste ranch, an adjoining property, and
both located In the Slmiikameen valley,
a few miles west of Nigbthawk, and
some twenty miles from Orovllle. The
purchaser is C. F. Schrock, a wealthy
cattle raiser living at Okanogan, and a
pioneer of Douglas and Okanogan
counties. The amount of land taken
over Is 1070 acres, and the purchase
price was $115,000, $75,000 for the Ir
win ranch and $40,000 for that of Mr.
Riste. Included In the Irwin transfer
were 380 head of cattle, 47 bead of
hot sea and a large amount of machin
ery necessary for operating a large
ranch.
The two farina that Mr. Schrock baa
takea over are the oldest settled and
best knowu stock ranches on this side
of the international boundary line la
the Stmllkameen valley. V. W. Cham*
paeys and Al. Histe took up their orig
inal places as homesteads many years
ago, gradually increasing their hold
ings by the purchase of adjoining
lands, Mr. Rlste continued bis resi
dence upon his place all these years.
Mr. Champneys disposed of bla hold
ings, as hereinbefore stated, last win
ter. When these pioneers filed upon
their land there were few settlers In
the country, and no market except
what the local mining Industry In the
country furnished. Of late an easy
means of reaching markets has been
provided, as the Great Northern road
runs through both ranches. Messrs.
Champneys and Rlste turned their at
tention largely to raising cattle and
both met with financial success In that
line. When they took up this land,
most of which Is on the rich, aluvtal
bottoms of the Slmllkameen river,
much of It was covered with a dense
growth of underbrush. With Infinite
labor and patience this brush was
grubbed out, and the land thus clear
ed is considered to be the best hay
land in the northwest. An immense
tonnage of hay is raised every year,
sufficient to feed many bead of stock,
and with the vast National forest re
serve adjoining for grazing purposes in
summer the combined property makes
an ideal cattle ranch, and that Is what
Mr. Schrock will use it for.
T. L. Irwin, who was a resident of
Seattle at the time, purchased the
Champneys ranch last winter with tho
Intention of following the stock busi
ness, but he was offered such a tempt
ing advance on the original purchase
price that he decided to sell and pock
et the profit. What his future Inten
tions are is not known. Mr. Rlste has
lived so long on his valley ranch that It
will be difficult for him to adlust him
self to new surroundings. By years of
hard work be has earned a rest, and ho
may eleit to transfer his lesldence to
Croville aiid lake life easy for a time.
Mr. Schrock has arranged to put a
manager In charge of his new pur
chase. He Is already the owner of some
2,000 head of cattle, and the stock go
ing with the Champneys place greatly
increases his herd. He Is rated as one
of the most wealthy men In the county
and that wealth is not going to shrink
any with this additional means of ac
cumulation In his possession.
AT THE LYRIC.
The Lyric has two swell presenta
tions for the coming week, among the
best of the innumerable films before
the public. For Saturday and Sunday
evenings there will be presented
“Tennessee’s Partner,” a plcturlzation
of Bret Harte’s famous story of that ti
tle, and for Wednesday and Thursday
evenings a dramatization of Jas. Fox,
Jr.s., celebrated novel “The Trail of
the Lonesome Pine." No one who has
ever read these fascinating stories will
fail to take advantage of this oppor
tunity to see the stories repeated in
pictures.
AGRICULTURAL LECTURE.
A. P. Oliver, an agriculturalist of
national repute, will deliver a lecture
in the library building Saturday even
ing, October 7. under the auspices of
the Commercial Club on better seed
and soil culture. Mr. Ollnger has de
voted a life time to studying agricul
tural subjects and bow to get the best
out of farming, and his lecture will be
both Interesting and educational. Every
farmer In the surrounding country
should hear him.
WEED DAY.
It has been suggested that every res
ident of the town get out next Tuesday
and cut weeds. It seems impossible to
employ help to clear off the weed nuis
ance, and the growth has become such
an eye sore that a number of citizens
have suggested to this paper to desig
nate Tuesday as weed day, and every
able bodied man get busy and aid In
eliminating Jungles that are a blot
upon the town.
The Ladles Aid of the M. E. church
will serve a chicken pie dinner In the
library building on Tuesday, November
7, election day.
Frank Calvert, head of the salts
company wishes to express his thanks
to the Orovllle Commercial club for the
efforts made to secure a better freight
rate for the output of the works.
