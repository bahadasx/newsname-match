German Prime Minister Posi
tive Armies Will Hold Out
Finally on Somme Front.
ADMITS HEAVY LOSSES
Forces Will Surely Hold Their
Own Against Russians
Rumania Betrayed
Friends.
London, Sept 29, 6:05. a. m. The
nllies cannot break through the Ger
man lines on the Somme, Chancellor
von Bethmann-Hollweg told the reich
stag yesterday, acording to an account
of his speech cabled to Reuter's by
way of Amsterdam. The German
prime minister made a similar state
ment in regard to the eastern front
"The English and French, 31 is
true," he said, "have achieved ad
vantages. Our 'first lines have been
pressed back some kilometers and we
have also to deplore heavy losses In
men and material. That was inevita
ble in an offensive on such a mighty
scale. But what our enemies hoped
to accomplish, namely break through
on a grand scale and roll up our
positions, has not been attained. The.,
battle of the Somme will cost further
sacrifices. Still another and another
village may be lost, but they will not
get through."
Will Hold Against Prussians.
In regard to the eastern front
where, the' chancellor said, the Rus
sians had renewed their offensive with
heavy attacks, he predicted the same
result. "Here, too, the battle is pro
ceeding," he said, "but just as surely
shall wo hold our own."
Referring to Rumania, the chancel
lor said that the old friendship of
Rumania had died "as the result of
mental excitement caused by tho con
sciousness that Rumania had betrayed
her allies." The speaker said that
the entente confidently hoped thai
Rumania's entrance into tho war
would bring in Its trail tho secession
of Turkey and Bulgaria. But Turkey
and Bulgaria were not Rumania and
Italy, he concluded.

"but after falling 5,000 feet I thought!
I would struggle all the same. Tho'
wind blew me over our lines and like
a flash I had a picture of my funeral j

coffin. I continued to fall and the
levers wouldn't budge. In vain I
pushed and pulled to right and left
I made a last desperate effort all to
no purpose, and then I saw the field I

Suddenly something happened and my
speed diminished. Then there was a
resounding crash and a violent shock.
When I recovered my wits I was in
the midst of the fragments of my ma

fectlon to the revolutionists of tho
Greek warship Hydra, In the small ll
hours of this morning, has caused ,H
great excitement in this Greek port.
The Hydra, anchored under the guns
of the arsenal last night, was silently
boarded at 3 o'clock this morning by t
a party of men in civilian dress. Tho lfl
loyalist officer, second' in command,
was aroused from his bunk and with
pistols at his head was forced with
other loyalist officers to embark in a IH
row boat. The commander, being a
Venlzelist, readily surrendered to the
boarders. Two tugs were attached by
tow ropes to the ship and as noise
lessly as possible she slipped her an- IJ
chor chains and was drawn by the
tugs from the company of the other
Greek men-of-war. The tugs towed
her to Salami's bay, where the allied
warships are stationed.
The ministry of marine stated to- fl
day to the Associated Press represent
ative that he regretted the incident
as, while the perpetrators are un- , jf
known, owing to their atdrc, it was
impossible to believe all of them were
ureeKs. ,
"It is more to be regretted," added j
the minister, "as it tends to lessen I IH
the prestige of the government at a
moment when It needs all possible lH
credit and unity to accomplish the dif- IH
ficult task before it." IH

Railroads Propose Advance of
Seven and Eight Cents on
Iron and Steel.
Washington, Sept 29. Tariffs of
railroads in the middle-west and east ''IH
proposing Increases of seven and ibl
elgit cents per hundred pounds on
iron and steel articles from Chicago, i lfl
Pittsburg and other points to the At- ll
lantlc seaboard and to gulf ports for ''H
export, were suspended today by the ,H
Interstate Commerce Commission un- ' iM
til January 29 pending Investigation. ,
Tha suspended tariffs would affect
a largo -volume of the shipments to ,
European belligerents. i'I
The proposed increases have been iH
vigorously fought by shippers, who 'IH
contended they were without justlfica-
tion aud an attempt by the carriers to 1-H
take some of the profits of the iron
and steel business. One company esti
mated that its loss under outstanding
contracts, If the advances became ef-
fective, would be $100,000. jH
The railroads claimed that they had il
made a one-third reduction in the
past in the iron and steel rates to
enable manufacturers to reach out for tl
foreign business, and that the roads
are now proposing to restoro rates to i'l
where they stood when exceptional Hl
conditions caused reductions. Tho ll
Pennsylvania railroad claimed as one
of its reasons for the increase that JH
it has to enlarge its terminal facili-
ties at New York, Philadelphia and il
Boston to' handle export trado at an
outlay of $25,000,000 and that deliv-
ery to shipside is more expensive than ll
to domestic consignees. il
