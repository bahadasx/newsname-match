UNIVERSAL
1IEITARV
INDUSTRIAL
AND ECONOMIC PREPAREDNESS
MAKE OTHER MATTERS INCON
SEQUENTIAL, SAYS FRANK A.
VANDERLIP.
Kansas City, Mo., Sept. 29. "If ever
a people should pause; if ever they
should look abroad and comprehend
their national dangers In tho light of
the terrlhlo realities that nro being
enarted before their eyes in other
nations. It Is now and wo are that
people."
In these words Frank A. Vanderllp
of New York, nddresslng the annual
convention of the Anierlcnn Bankers
association, warned his hearers that
they should not tnko too easily tho
present great wealth of the country
that 'seems dangerously likely to sub
merge us In our own prosperity."
Rather, he said, with an opportunity
before us "such as no country ever
had to lay the sure foundations of a
great future," we must not bo "so
Intent upon dividing the proceeds of
present prosperity that we fall to
safeguard Its permanency.
Mr. Vanderllp, after speaking of tho
war's cost In Europe and outlining the
financial status of tills country, de
clared:
"In a word, I believe the greatest
need of the day and a need so funda
mental as to make other matters In
consequential in comparison, Is the
need of universal military, Industrial
and economic preparedness."
He asked for training In military
sorvlce for all men', greater savings
by all classes and greater efficiency
In Industrial pursuits.
"I once thought you could count uni
versal military service as an economic)
waste," ho said. "I feel confident,
In the light of events of the last two
years, that it la not only a military
necessity of superlative Importance
but that our national lifo would draw
a unity, our democracy would receive
a re-lnvigorntlon ana our youth would
obtain a physical training nnd compre
hension of tho value of obedience and
a patriotic devotion to the welfare of
tho nation, which could be obtained
In no other way."
Mr. Vanderllp's title was "The Need
for a United Nation." and this does
not embrace military unity alone.
"Back of physical training, there
must be moral training," he declared.
"There must bo the creation of a
public opinion that will think deeply
and clearly regarding tho great In
ternatlopal questions that we are fac
ing. We have need Tor developing a
"h nr rut, clear sighted public opinion
that will see things as they are and
that will have courage without audac
ity, firmness without impetuosity. We
need to have what we have not now
a public opinion tl,-vt would not per
mit a shuffling attitude In regard to
International issues, an opinion that
would make temporizing In the hand
dling of foreign relations Impossible
where fundamental prtnclples are In
volved." Efficiency In Indust-y must come so
no man will be Idle, but that all will
have continuous work, the speaker
said, and to make tosslbla the crea
tion of new factories, new railroads
and other labor producing elements,
all persons must practice economy and
save some part of their wages and In
comes. Mr. Vanderllp scarcely touched
upon the banking business except to
say that he believed the federal re
serve act "embodies sound fundament
al principles too valuable. Indeed, too
essential to be abandoned, the free
working of which, however, has been
entangled and hampered In Its incep
tion by political considerations and
administrative attlti'de to such an ex
tent as to endanger the success of
what should rightly be the most Im
portant step ever taxen in American
banking.
