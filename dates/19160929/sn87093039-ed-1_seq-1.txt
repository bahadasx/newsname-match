Apple Picking at Peshastin
Guy Stage, one of the pioneer appl p
growers of the Peshastin valley was
! here one day this week and said to a
reporter for this paper that apple pick
ing was well under way and that about
300 cars of apples wou'd probably be
shipped from that point. The apples
Ihe said, would not average as large
I this year as in former years, but that
I the yield would be larger on account
'of the increased acreage coming into
! bearing. Only a few cars had been
j shipped 10 far but that from now on
! they would move regularly. The as
sociation would control the larger por
tion, seme 175 cars. The opening
price, he said was fairly good, and if it
holds up thru the season will give the
growers satisfactory returns.
Damage to Apple Crop Not
Serious.
Mr. J. B. Adams, who was in We
natchee Monday when the wind storm
occurred, says, in the Lower valley the
damage to the apples was so slight as
not to amount to anything. In driving
up the valley in the afternoon he says
he made some investigation and found
that the damage is confined to that
portion of the valley between Peshastin
and Dryden, with some, tho not as
great, damage at Cashmere. The Guy
Stage orchard at the upper end of the
Peshastin district was not damaged at
all. From the Wenatchee river bridge
at Peshastin to Cashmere covers the
damaged area, with the most serious
damage in the vicinity of Dryden. The
orchards on the north side of the We
natchee river between Leavenwortb
and Peshastin escaped damage. His
own orchard, a mile east of town,
suffered no damage.
Peshastin
Robert A. Wright, who has been id
the state institution at Medical Lake
for the past two months, died Saturday
morning, Sept. 23, 1916, at 7 o'clock.
The cause of death was due to harden
ing of the arteries, and old age, the
deceased being past 78 years of age.
R. A. Wright was an old veteran hav
ing served four years and eight months
as a spy during the civil war. At the
close of the war he was honorably dis
charged. Beside his widow two child
ren are left to mourn his demise. The
daughter, Beatrice, resides in Seattle,
while Fred J. Wright resides on the
ranch near this place with his mother.
The body was cremated in Spokane
and has been sent to Seattle for burial.
Friends of the family extend their
sympathy in their hour ol sorrow.
The wind storm Tuesday was bad.
Over half of the apple crop was de
stroyed, trees that were eight years old
were blown out of the ground. The
growers are at a loss just what to do
with the windfall apples, as they are
bruised and not even colored up yet.
The wind Tuesday done more damage
than the hail did last year, as not an
orchard was missed. People who
figured having 5000 boxes have about
2000 ou the trees to pick. The exact
loss will be hard to figure, but it sure
hit everybody alike.
Frank Shell and family returned
home from Spokane Wednesday. Mr.
Shell made the trip in his new Over
land car.
Robt. Pagel and wile are here from
Roy, Was-h., and will spend the fall on

Peshastin has been in the dark since
the wind storm as the light wires were
put out of commission.
Jess Hauck and wife, of Nigger
creek, have moved to Cashmere for
the winter.
A large number of Peshastin people
attended the minstrel show in Leaven

The Higher Up the Valley You Go the Bigger and Better the Apples Grow
Leavenworth, Wash., Friday, September 29, 1916
HEAD OE THE SNOW SHED
CONTRACTING COMPANY HERE
Found Work Well Under Way With Pros
pect of Completing It Before
Winter Sets in.
Mr. Hoy, cf the St. Paul contracting
firm of W. J. Hoy & Co.. spent last
Sunday and Monday here inspecting
the progress cf the work going on up
the canyon where approximately a half
million dollars is being spent by the
Gieat Northern rai'.road company to pro
tect iis road bed against a recurrence
of !ast winter's interruption by snow
l slider.
He said he fouad the work well un
der way and hopes it will be completed
before the severe weather sets in. He
was accompanied by Chief Engineer A.
H. Hoagland, of the Great Northern.
Considering that the work began late
and the difficulties under which the
work had to be done he says he was
pleased with the progress made. The
work has been directly under charge of
Mr. W. L. Clement, a member of the
firm who has 6pent most of his time
here the past five months. The com
pany has a large contract in Spokane
where the G. N. tracks are being ele
vated so that all street traffic will pass
under the tracks. Approximately a
million dollars is involved in the Spo
kane contract.
The Hoy company has all the snow
shed work on the east side of the Cas
cades between Leavenworth and the
summit, and for the last few months,
or since the work began, has given
employment to from 200 to 350 men.
The office of the company has been
located here and is in charge of Mr.
Shultz. Speaking of the work which
has to be done under considerable
difficulty Mr. Clement said tho con
siderable blasting has been done, and
much of it heavy blasting, his com
pany had succeeded in keeping the
track clear and caused snly slight in
terruption in the movement of trains.
Judge Remembered Poindexter Case
During the argument on a demurrer
in the Naylor case in the North Yaki
ma superior court recently, says the
North Yakima Republic, counsel had
frequent occasion to cite the supreme
court's ruling in a case similar to the
Naylor action in which one of the par
ties to the suit was named Poindexter.
"This case applies exactly, your
honor," explained Attorney Frank Al
len, and I would like the court to ac
quaint itself with the facts before pass
ing on this demurrer."
"The Poindexter case," mused
Judge Kauffman, meditatively. "Oh,
yes, I remember the Poindexter case
perfectly. It was tried last Tuesday."
Whereupon attorneys and spectators
joined in the merriment occasioned by
the retort.
Mr. R. Murdoch, from Monroe,
Wash., is here this week visiting with
Ray Ross, of the Hotel Franklin. He
is a timber man and has been fol
lowing the woodsman's calling for nearly
fifty years, on the west side of the
mountains. So long, in fact, he says,
that he has moss on his back from
contact with the Sound climate and
came over on the east side to get dried
out. He says he has fallen in love
with the dry, cool climate of this local
ity. He says he worked with Mr.
Ross' father in the woods over thirty
years ago.
The President is desirous that poli
tics should stop at the water's edge —
which is his way of intimating that the
discussion of our foreign relations
should not be featured in the cam
paign. The republicans will hardly
comply with the suggestion. There
have been too many "great diplomatic
victories" heralded from the White
House in the past two years to admit
of tabooine a discussion of them.

Deer and Goat Hunting Oct. 1.
Already the deer and goat hunter is
planning to go after big game as soon
as the season opens. Getting his
hunting outfit ready. Cleaning up his
shooting irons and layiDg in his shells
and laying out his hunting outfit. The
first of October will find the hills full of
hunters. We are told the hills are full
of mountain goat but so far the num
ber of deer seen and reported is not
encouraging, indicating that the deer
hunter will have to go far and get few
of this much coveted game. The
deer and goat season opens Oct 1 and
closes Nov. IS.

my name appears on the democratic
ticket I have been solicited by neigh

TUESDAY'S STORM CAUSES
LOSS TO APPLE GROWERS
Greatest Damage in Vicinity of Peshas
tin and Dryden—Windfalls Prac
tically Worthless
An unusually severe wind storm
swept thru the Wensachee valley Tues
day. In some localities it almost de
veloped cyclonic proportions, uprooting
fruit trees and great pine trees.
Among the heaviest sufferers in the
Peshastin valley are W. M. Stark,
owner of a large and highly cultivated
orchard. Dr. Saunders is another heavy
loser. The G. S. Merriam orchard was
badly windswept, as was also the or
chard of J. L. Arbopast. From Pe
shastin to Dryden, a distance of about
four miles, all orchardists suffered more
or less. Near Dryden the storm showed
unusually severe effects. Near the
postoffice a number of orchards were
badly damaged, apple trees being up
rooted. At the Tom Henry ranch
near by, not only orchaid trees were
torn up by the roots but some great
pine trees were literally uprooted, The
financial loss cannot be estimated at
this time but will amount to a consid
erable sum.
According to more recent reports
coming in the storm of Monday was
quite general all over this section.
Parties coming down from Wenatchee
lake report that forest trees were blown
down all along the road. The first
party that came down from the lake
after the storm found the road obstruc
ted by fallen trees and spent fully six
hours in clearing the trees out of the
way from the lake to Leayenworth.
COUNCIL PROCEEDINGS
Council met in regular session Tues
day evening. Hale, Snyder, Miller,
Reynolds and Kugelrnan were present,
also Mayor Day and Attorney Nelson
Day Reynolds was given the ap
pointments on the various committees
formerly held by Mr. Woldenburg.
The request for a light on Cascade
and Birch streets was granted.
Street Commission Tolbert was in
structed to have the rubbish cleaned
ofl the sidewalk alongside the old
Brown residence in the lower end of
town.
A proposition to buy an adding ma
chine at an expense of 8200 was
turned down.
The following resolution of respect
to the memory of former councilman
S. C. Woldenburg was passed:
Whereas, S. C. Woldenberg. who
has for the past number of years been
a member of this council, having acted
in the capacity of mayor of the City of
Leavenworth, as well as councilman for
a number of terms, has been removed
from our midst to the great beyond, and
Whereas, be was a man who always
had the interests of our city at heart;
therefore out of respect for his memory
and in appreciation of his untiring ef
forts in the city's behalf during his life
time;
Be It Resolved, that we extend our
sincere sympathy to his family, and
that this resolution be made a matter
of record and that a copy of it be
spread upon the minutes of the coun
cil and that a copy be sent to his
family.
An ordinance was passed making it
necessary for a councilman to be a
resident of the ward he represents. It
also obliges all city officials and em
ployes to be residents of the city.
The resolution offering a reward in
bootlegging and gambling cases was
recinded and an ordinance is being
prepared to take its place.
There was some discussion in regard
to the proposed pumping plant and
the sentiment seems to be against the
propostiion.
Mrs. C. W. Seeley and son will re
turn from Vancouver, B. C tomorrow,
after an absence of three weeks. The
report that Mr. Seeley contemplated
removal from Leavenworth is untrue.
He says he is here to stay.

$1.50 Per Year
Are More Democrats Like This?
"Why I Quit the Demoratic Party"
is the subject of an address delivered
before the republican conven'.ion at
Chandler, Oklahoma, a few days ago,
by Judge R. J. Sheve, who was a war
a war horse in the democratic party for
more than twenty years He confines
his reasons chiefly to state issues, and
charges his former political associates
with extravagance, inefficiency, broken
pledges, needless increase in the num
ber of offices, running the state in
debt, wastefulness, etc., all of which is
true of national as well as local demo
cratic administration. And there are
thousands of other democrats who, for
the same reasons, have quit the party.
Some Railroads Want the fight
Hour Day
The recent railroad legislation is
bringing out some interesting facts and
deductions. One railroad man con
tends that the men have been given a
"Gold Brick." If the railroads are
forced to accept the recent bill as the
law they will go by the law and not the
rules that have heretofore formed the
basis of figuring time on railroads. The
companies will contend as the matter
of wages has been taken out of the
hands of the railroads and made a mat
ter of law, it will supersede all the old
rules and regulations between them and
their employes and will be the sole
guide by which future employment
will be regulated. It is generally un
derstood that the whole matter of wages
under the bill will wait on a supreme
court decision which may hold the
recently passed bill unconstitutional.
in which event no one knows "where
we will be at." But in the event the
bill is held sound by the court there
are some interesting questions to be
threshed out. Following is the way
one railroad man reasons the thing out:
For instance, there is nothing in the
law to prevent the railroads from work
ing tneir men ten, twelve, even six
teen hours a day, providing the pay is
reckoned upon the '"basic" eight-hour
scale; and in that case the runs of the
men will be redistributed with the
probable result that some trainmen will
find themselves without work for any
number of hours a day.
Moreover, if the eight-hour scale is
to be "basic", the railroads may con
tend with no little force that no man
shall be paid anything unless he works
eight hours, or that if he works less
than eight hours he shall be paid for
the time pro rata according to the
"'basic" scale.
There are many trainmen now run
ning on the mileage basis who complete
their day's work in less than eight
hours but who receive a full day's
wage. Upon the "basic" principle
the?e men could be required to run
the additional time to make up the
eight hours or to have their pay reduced
accordingly.
Legislation without investigation
often results in some very interesting
by-products and it may be that labor
has received a gold brick.
Thirty Days in Jail for Getting
