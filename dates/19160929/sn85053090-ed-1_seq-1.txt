Plevna Pleased With Fair
The Fallon county fair has
baen held and has gone into his
tory once more. It was attended
by a large number of people from
all over the county. To judge from
the appearance of the crowds, ev
erybody had agood time and en
joyed the sports and entertain
ment provided. The agricultural
exhibits and the school and fancy
work exhibits were drawing a
large number of visitors who
were very much pleased by the
many and good exhibits. While
of the agricultural exhibits there
were perhaps not as many as last
year, there was still enough var
iety to make them very interest
ing. This uart of Fallon County
vas well represented by many
exhibits which brought home sev
eral prizes, the list of which we
hope to publish next week. Eka
laka knows how to entertain her
visitors and there was one good
old time in old Pup Town again
this last Fair time and we were
glad of this opportunity to get
better acquaintod with the good
people in good old Ekalaka.
