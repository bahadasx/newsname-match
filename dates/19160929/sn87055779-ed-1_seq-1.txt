this little shortcoming in its tail it
would have been impossible to carry
out all of the details in connection
with the wascr of a cow made by
J. M. Studebaker, sr., and Leighton
Pine at the time the standpipe con-
tr"
was at its height many
i years ago.
J. M. Sludebaker and Mr. Tine
took opposite sides in the standpipe
question, the former favoring a ys
tem that is similar to the one in use
now. while the latter stood for a
ttindpipe. Mr. Studehaker offered to
put up a cow as the stakes if it were
possible to drive him off the roof of
his factory with a stream of water
under the standpipe, pressure. He
lest and the cow was sold at public
auction for charity.
The cow in question had only
about half as much of a tail as thes
animals usually have, hut somebody
tied a tail on with a ribbon. As the
cow was being led down the street a
butcher ran out of his store- and
pulled the false tail off the cow and
hung it in front of his store as an
advertisement.
Hence the necessity of a cow
without the full allotment of tail.

by the pageant committee, dated

CHICAGO. Sept 29. Japan is
bending her every c-dort to becoming
a great v--ld trade factor and ap

here today on his way back east
after a visit to the orient.
'"The Japanese are going along as
if there were no war," he said.
"They have taken up extensively tho
manufacturers that were stopped in
the belligerent counts ies of the war.
Japan is busy making clothing and
shoes and is becoming a great com

Japanese are faking sides in the

cupied by lifimany.
"Strange as it may seem. Japan is
really most interested in the out

Japan to indicate an unfriendly feel

to the contrary. Leading men seem
anxious to recognize the wealth and

NEW YORK. Sept. 29. A "novel

was penned. In it she reveals, ac
cording to her husband's atlidavit,
that her marriage to him was a plot
to get his money and that she had
been his wife only in name so she
might return to the young artist as
had left him.
When Asta was 18, shortly before
As'-he unbosomed to her his secret
love of eight years standing, he says
she secretly married a young man

HEART BURWED IN
BERLIN PLANS
TO RENEW HER
Government Has Been Won
Over by Advocates of Plan
to Starve Out England
by Use of Divers.
International News Service:
lilillLIN, (via Sayville wireless.)
Sept. 2'J. All (Jermany looks confi
dently for a renewal of ruthless
submarine warfare.
The bust remaining doubts that
the government has been won ovet
by the advocates of the plan to
"starve (tut England" by the means
of more than r.OO submarines were
dispelled by the imperial chancel
lor's speech in the Reichstag yester
day. "A flerman statesman," the chan
cellor said, "who would hesitate to
use against this enemy (Kngland)
every available instrument of bat
tle that would really shorten the
war such a statemon should be
hanged."
The only man who may avert, or
postpone, at least, the resumption
of ruthless submarine warfare is
James W. Cerard, the American
ambassador fto (Jermany.
Upon the result of his visit to
"Washington, it is declared here,
hinges the whole question. Though
officially explained as a "vacation,"
his trip to the United State is be
lieved to be in reality a mission
from the German government in a
o lasi euort to oreak tne untisn
blockade.
Will Await His Return.
Tt i believer! therefore that the
I proposed full-fledged U-boat cam
paign will not be initiated until he
returns until definite word has been
received that his mission has failed.
"Germany, according to an authen
tic authority, considers that the
time has arrived when she can and
must take advantage of the la-st
paragraph of her Sussex note, in
which it was made clear that her
stand in the submarine issue might
have to be reversed if Washington
failed to force Great Rritaln to
abandon the blockade as now car
ried out.
The galleries were crowded to
capacity as the Reichstag opened.
All foreign diplomats in Berlin
were present. Among the Reichstag
members were many in uniforms,
some in bandages. Pres't Kaempf
in his introductory speech said that
the military, economic and political
war had reached its climax. Uer
many's position, he said, was "sat
isfactory in every respect."- He
read telegrams exchanged with the
kaiser on the second anniversary' of
the war and with the president of
the Hungarian parliament at the
fall of Turtukai fortress. His speech
was fretted with applause.
After the transaction of routine
business the chancellor rose, amid
dtep silence to make his ardently
expected "confession of faith."
Iknicws History.
He reviewed at length the diplo
matic history preceding the Rou
manian intervention. Roumania'a
policy throughout was, he declared,
to "play safe" and wait to see which
side w;w sure of winning the war.
After the fall of Przemysl, he hjs-
Ferted, Premier IJratianu, was ready
to pay "with Juda.j-like treason"
for riches his country w ished to gain
for the smallest possible sacrifices.
Negotiations with Itussia struck a
snak, however, the chancellor did,
because both countries coveted the
lSukowina, while Roumania, in addi
tion, wanted to acquire the entire
Hungarian territory a-s far as the
Theisse.

International New s Service :
LOS AXGELKS, Calif., Sept. 29.
A tale of amazing1 ventures, begun
when the engine of his motorboat
went wrong and he and a companion
were compelled to drift for a week
at sea, was told today by Charles
Borden, a bookkeeper, who had
been mysteriously missing since
April 7, und who returned here as
cabin. boy on a tramp steamer.
Borden said that he and Fred
Meyer were in the motorboat on
what was intended to be a week's
fishing trip and that they saw no
land after their engine broke down
until they were lardti on a rocky
island, the location of which he did
not know. They were taken off by
an Italian vessel, which transferred
them to one bound to the South
seas and which was wrecked.
A French steamer picked them
up and landed them at Sydney, Aus
tralia, where Meyer died as a result
of his privations and Borden to keep
from starving joined the Australian
army. Later he effected his release
by magnifying: an old injury to his
arm, after his regiment had been
ordered to Egypt. Finally he ship
ped as cabin boy for the return trip
home.

TO JOIN STRIKE
Leaders Contend Failure is
Due to Shortness of Time
in Which to Act.
International News SeTvi-e:
NEW YORK. Sept. 29. Although
a stunning blow has been dealt to
the hopes of strike leaders by the
failure of the building traded work
men and teamsters to join a general
walkout in sympathy with the trac
tion employes. Hugh Frayne, chair
man of the new union board of
strategy, declared that that "the
tight is still on."
"We have not given up the idea
of a general tie-up," said Frayne.
"The apparent failure of various
unions to join us was due to tho
fact that they did not have time
to act."
The allied building trades and
the teamsters, comprising about
120,000 men, have deferred decisive
section for a. week and in the min-
time strike leaders are now work-
ing to bring about the general
sympathetic strike on next Monday

Police Commissioner Woods, who
has been following the situation,
said that the labor situation is less
menacing today than it has been at
any time sitice the elevated railway
and subway men quit work.
The danger of a complete tie-up
of elevated and subway lines through
action by the Brotherhood of Loco
motive Jngineers also is dwindling
rapidly.
Certain of the labor leaders are
bitterly disappointed over the show
ing made, while others continue to
claim that about 2"0,CcO men and
women have struck.
Even this figure is short of the
predictions made yesterday.
There has been a sharp decline in
