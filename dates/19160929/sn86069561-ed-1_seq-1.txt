Left Leggedness
It is a familiar fact that a person lost in
the woods wanders around iu circles to the
right. The reason is found In the demonstrated
fact that the human race is right-handed and
left-legged . That is the left leg is stronger
than the right one; and tbe constant tendency
because of the greater activity of the left leg
and the longer stride taken with it, is to bear
to the right. Locomotion is a continuous pe
destrian match between the right leg and the
left one, and the left is continually getting
ahead.
It's 311st the way in money matters. Our
existance is a constant battle between spend
ing and saving, and our ' sbend-Ieg " seems
the stoutest and is generally in the lead. To
overcome this the wise ones are handicapping
theii "spending member" with a Saving Ac
count and are steering a staight course out of
the forest of debt into tbe civilization of
peace and plenty.
