FROM THE PEOPLE
From Hinry A. Ulnar.
Some time ago I ate a real Chinese
dinner in a Chinese restaurant. The
main dish waa chow, which ia the real
national dish of China, chop seey or
suey being American Chinese. I will
(rive you the receipt for making chow.
Take two shredded wheat biscuits and
unshred them. Card them out nntil
each fibre is almost straight. Soak in
hot aalty ham gravy mixed with steak
gravy and a little celery and onions
until they are no longer brittle but
soft and pliable. Cover with hot cab
bage alaw also salted. Pour on a little
pepper sauce, vinegar, bay rum, horse
radish, witch hazel and tomato catsup.
Serve warm.
The Chicago Art institute is some
thing the city is proud of. It has
copies of most all the famous statuary
. and paintings and some really fine
pieces of modern sculpture. I spent an
hour or so there the other day. Looked
only at the statuary as too much sight
seeing of this sort leaves only a
blurred impression of anything. There
is some fine models of Egyptian and
Abyssinian sculpture, too. Notably
the image of Rameses I, who is sup
posed to be the Pharoh of Hoses' day.
He looks like Alice Connors' older
brother might look. There is certainly
a strong family resemblance.
Last Sunday a friend took me out in
one of those fine autos made in Detroit
by . I forget the name but Jim
Horton knows it. We rode about 56
miles, all over the boulevard system of
Chicago. The boulevards are fine
broad streets and avenues connecting
the parks and running around the cen
tral part of the city. No drainage or
hauling is allowed on them, and a rapid
speed allowed. They certainly consti
tute a magnificent series of driveways
and the parks are large one, at Uut,
is a mile square, and beautifully and
exquisitely kept.
The more I see of Chicago the better
I like it. The people are cordial, that
is the better clasw are, and I see no
particular difference between these
people and our people except that they
live in a big city and those don't.
I have found the pteasantest place in
Chicago. It is a French restaurant,
the De Jonge, where the newspaper
men generally dine in the evenings.
I have met a good many of them and
they are a pleasant lot, and some of
the finest are Tribune men. In those
I have met there is not the slightest
particle of the spirit or feeling that
animated the Tribune editorial against
the south last summer. It is quite
. the contrary with them. To me it is
quite a delightful way of spending an
hour or so in the evenings. Of course
the dinners are simple. You know
that or the newspaper fraternity would
not be able to eat there often. But
we sit and smoke ond talk for an hour
or so after the meal. I get to know
what so and so will have in the next
morning's paper, which makes the
next morning's paper more interesting.
I am working nights now about half
the week. Not working, either, much.
I come back to the office at nine and
wait until the New York telegraphic
news comes in we have an operator
in our office read them, correct them
and then 0. K. them. Then the oper
ator here gives the mainoffice the
signal and the stories are telegraphed
out to all the dailies we send to from
this division. It is now 10:20, the
story, there was only one tonight, has
come in and is being sent out, and the
New' York headquarters has tele
graphed "good night," which means
nothing more doing today.
Last night the manager of the Postal
Telegraph company took me over their
main office. Only about 80 operators
were on duty at the hour, 11, and enly
one of the three big rooms where they
work was being used. There were
nearly a thousand instruments in the
room. Some of the ordinary ones we
are accustomed to, some inatwouia
taie in a message from New York at
one end and send it out under a new
current to San Francisco from the
other end, some that did various other
stunts. I saw some machines like
typewriters where the operator waa
writing the message here and the re
ceiving machine was wiiting it in
Denver. Next to this a receiving
machine waa writing a message on the
typewrites attachment which an oper
ator in St Louis was writing there. I
saw the date appear at 11.03 p, m. 1
looked at the clock on the wall and it
waa 11:03. It did not take a second to
come from St. Louis to Chi 475 miles
awav.
'I k tka taa1r nnf fn tn!na pifa Mr
I Ralph Waldo Emerson, a kinsman of
th ppt American o ? tm m
He is a newspaper man and a crack
ing good one. Some of his stuff may
appear in the patent sheets of the
Beacon. I told him about the Beacon's
quoting his distinguished namesake in
writing up Sam Gavin's house in the
woods and he was much amused.
You ought to see bow busy this
whole headquarters is. You know
how busy a newspaper office gets just
before the paper cornea out-rlike it
was that night you set up a prominent
prairie farmer's wedding a few yeers
ago? Well, it ia that busy here practi
cally all the time.
Hawaiian music is all the rage here
now and to me it is peculiarly attract,
ive the throbbing melody. The Rag
Time Pipes of Pan is fine too, classic
rag time as its name denotes. I saw
Lew Fields, the most famous living
comedian two nights ago. The fun
niest thing he got off was He was
talking to his grown stepdaughter and
said "tomorrow your mother and I
celebrate our golden wedding annivers
ary." She says, "Why you have not
been married but a year." And he
says "Mv God; is that all?" Some old
bachelor readers of the Beacon may
think this funny.
We have had some cool weather
lately; cool enough to do much crop
damage. But it is clear and bracing
cold, not damp and chilling.
Mr. and Mrs. DeYampert Brame are
living here now. not so very far from
my rooming place. They are doing
light housekeeping in a flat.
We are looking for Senator Williams
here soon. He opens the campaign in
Michigan early In October. Is resting
right now at some springs. Senator
Stone of Missouri is here now; takes
charge of the senatorial campaign,
that is, lwks after the Democratic
candidates tor senator in the various
Btates. He ia aix feet four or five
inches tall and distinguished looking.
Also hi is a master politician as well as
statesmen.
They tell me that all this talk about
betting two to one in New York on
Hughes is bosh. That no Democrats
can get any money placed. It has al
ways just been taken or some such ex
cuse In other words it ia "wash bets"
like the "wash sales" they have or
used to have on stock exchanges, pure
make-believe.
To tht CMmm of Macon, Mho.
For many yeara past the Mayor and
Board of Aldarmen have been renting
quartets thst while small were suffi
cient to accommodate the city's busi
ness. However, since the increased
growth in the Water Works plant and
the necessity for the city to keep on
hand supplies for the electric light sys
tem, as well as for the water works
has necessitated, not only a larger
storeroom, but an entrance that is
easily accessible to the patrons.
The Fire Department now has a
truck and two hose reels, to extinguish
more promptly the fires that may oc
cur in the city, all of these conditions
have arisen and it makes it necessary
for the city to have larger quarters.
To rent several buildings would of
necessity compel the city to employ
labor that would be unnecessary if the
entire city business was under one
roof. The rent in the course of time
would more than exceed the amount
necessary to build or purchase a build
ing large enough for the city'a pur
pose. On the other hand, there ia no
place where our citizenship can go to
discuss anv public Question or to
meet for the benefit of the upbuilding
of the city, unless it be in the back of
some store house or in the Court house,
and it occurs to me that this ia a great
need at this time.
The citv is out of debt except as to
its bond issues. There would be at the
expiration of this tax collecting period
about $30,000.00 credited to the sinking
fund. There ia now something over
120,000.00 loaned bringing in 8 per
cent. These loans are made, of course,
for the purpose of liquidating the bond
indebtedness at the maturity of the
bonds, which are from 10 to 12 years
off.
In asking the taxpayers for their
support of this measure at this time
for the purpose of building or purchas
ing a municipal building, the Mayor
and Board of Aldermen recognize the
present financial conditions, and would
not do so if it raised the taxes one
cent It being the purpose of the city
to reduce the levy under the sinking
fund and adding same to general fund
so as to take care of the amount of
this obligation.
Hence, the rents in the course of
time will take care of and more than
pay for the building and improvements,
which it seems impossible for the city
to do without at present
The fact will be appreciated, to,
that there are no taxes, either state,

same. Enough said.
Glad to have you come, even if
you don't want to buy now.

The election will be next Tuesday,
October 3d, and it must be carried by
a two-third majority voting, and I beg
of the citizens of our town to come
out on that day, for it is important
they come and vote for the measure,
to the end that the city may have a
city hall that will not only be an orna
ment to the city, but will provide a
place for its officers, electric light and
fire departments, and a place for its
citizens to meet without any expense
to them should the occasion arise.

How to Form a National Farm
Loan Aooodation
Since bv uniting to form a na
tional farm loan association, farm
ers are enabled to borrow money
from Federal land Danka. it is es
sential that they understand the
formation and operation or such
associations. This is fully des
cribed in Circular No. 2, recently
issued by the reaerai arm jjoan
Bureau.
According to the provisions of
the Federal Farm Loan Act, at
least ten farmers must unite to
form a national farm loan associa
tion. If more than ten wish to
unite, so much the better; that
figure is set as the minimum, and
farmers only can become members.
These prospective members may
all be residents of the same com.
mnnity or they may live in wide
ly separated parts of the same
county. They must, however,
all be men who wish to borrow
money on farm mortgages at 4, 5
or 6 per cent interest, the mort
gages to run from 6 to 40 years.
To form an association these ten
borrowers call a meeting at some
convenient place and after dis
cussing the subject informally, ap
point a committee to draw up ar
ticle of association which should
set forth the object of the aagopja,

which it is to do business. All of
those who intend to join must
sign these articles, a copy of
which is sent to the Federal land
bank of that district.
A loan committee of three mem
bers must also be appointed to
pass on loans. It is their duty to
examine the farms and farm lands
of the members, justly appraise
their value, and include this in a
signed report sent to the Federal
land bank. This report and the
ai tides of association must be ac
companied by an affidavit signed
and acknowledged by the mem
bers and by the secretary treas
urer, whose address must be
given. It must set forth that
each subscriber is the owner of
farm land or is about to become
such. Thus a person may not
actually be in possession of a
farm, but if he expects in a short
time to become the owner, by pur
chase, of a particular farm des
cribed in his application, he is
eligible to become an association
member. The affidavit should
also state that the desired loans
total $20,000 or more. The low
est sum any one farmer may bor
row is 1100; the highest is f 10,
000. These associations are to be
organized by and for farmers, but
no farmer can join without buy
ing shares in the association pro
portionate to the sum he wishes
to borrow. The price of the
share is fixed at 15, and the value
of shares owned by any one mem
ber must equal 5 per cent of his
loan. Thus, if a man wishes to
borrow $100, he must take one
share of stock; if $500, five shares;
and if $10,000, 100 shares. These
shares may be paid for with cash
at the time the borrower applies
for his loan, or he can wait until
the loan is received and pay for
them from it. Or, he may, if he
desires, add the value of the
.4-
Ofr"
providing the total amount does
not exceed 50 per cent of the ap
praised value of the land and 20
per cent of the permanent im
provements. When the debt is
paid, the stock is canceled. Thus
a man holding two shares is paid
$10, the stock canceled and he is
no longer a member of the associa
tion. It should be stated here, that
the appraisal by the loan commit
tees is not the final one. An ap
praiser is sent out bv the Federal
land bank to check with their
work and his report is accepted
as final.
Every farmer by buying stock
becomes a shareholder in his as
sociation and when the money is
turned in to the land bnnk by
the association, it becomes a
shareholder in the bank. These
associations being co-operative
in character, each shared ilder is
liable for the debts of his asso
ciation. Such liability is fixed
by law at twice the value of the
stock owned by each member.
Thus, in case an association
fails, a member holding one
share of stock i3 liable for 5 in
addition to what he has already
paid for that stock. In thi3 way
members take but little risk and
can reap the benefits of co-operative
mortgage credits.
The profits of the land banks
go to the associations. While
the government is a stock holder
its stock draws no dividenes. It
is expected that the government
will gradually withdraw its hold
ings and the associations will in
this way ultimately become own
ers of the banks.
When an association apDlies to
the land bank for a charter the
application must state that a tem
porary organization has been
formed. This organization
elects a board of directors of five
or more members and a loan
committee of three member?,

The directors in turn elect a
president, vice-president, and
secretary - treasurer. The last
named officer need not be a mem
ber of the association, and be
cause he does practically all of
the work, receives a small salary.
At present land banks hare
not been located and organized.
This work may take several
months, but in the meantime
farmers can form their prelimin
ary organizations. Doing this
will enable them to get their
loans quicker than if they wait
until the land banks are located.

these associations and other de
