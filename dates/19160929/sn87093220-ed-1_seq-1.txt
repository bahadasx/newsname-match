HUGHES DODGES
EIGHT HOUR LAW
Attacks Wilson Plan, But
Won't Say What He Would
Hove Done in the Case
ONLY WAY TO AVERT STRIKE
Hughes Is Asked If He Would
Have Vetoed the Bill and
Invited Disaster.
NEW YORK, Sept. 27. —(Special)—
Republioan Nomina* la Aeked to Da
clara if Ha Would Hava Vetoed the
Bill With the Certain Auurance o*
Induatrial Diaaater to the Country.
So busy has been Charles E. Hughe*
criticising the deeds of the Wilson ad
ministration that he lils had little
time to tell, or has purposely evaded
telling the puNie what he would have
done had he been president under sini
11ar "ircumstiiui.es.
Lately Mr. Hughes has turned his
attacks upon President Wilson's suc
cessful settlement of the crisis in the
railroad world by causing to be passed
by congress the Adamson eight hour
bin. Mr. Hughes has characterize!
ttiis action as a "surrender to force;"
he is "opposed to being dictated to by
any power on eartli before the facts
gre known." and he would not act un
til he had had a "fair investigation and
candid treatment."
Taking Issue with the Republican
candidate's attitude, the New York
Times in an editorial asks: "What
would Mr. Hughea hava dona?"
"Well, what way would Mr. Hughes
have taken?" continues the Times.
"What would he hjive done? Here
■was Mr. Wilson's position; The broth
erhoods refused arbitration; the rail
road presidents would not accept the
settlement Mr. Wilson proposed, grant
ing the eight hour standard day, with
provision for an impartial inquiry into
its working. There was no law on
the statute books to enforce arbitra
tion.

Would Hughe* Have Dona It?
"Mr. Hughes would not surrender

would have eurrendered the country to

would Mr. Hughes have brought on a

Would Mr. Hughes have vetoed the

FIREPROOFING
WOOD SHINGLES
lowa Chemist Discovers Com
pound That Makes Shingles
Absolutely Fireproof.
BOON FOR SHINGLE TRADE
Shingle Industry Has Long
Been Experimenting With
Fireproofing Liquids.
SEATTLE, Sept. 28. —According to
information in the hands of the West
Coast Lumbermen's Association, an
lowa pharmacist, after seventeen
months experimenting, has turned the
chemical "trick" which makes woden
shingles absolutely fireproof.
The shingle industry of the Paci
fic Northwest which has gone back
rapidly in recent years, after making
possible the early agricultural devel
opment of Western Washington and
Western Oregon, may through this
new invention, regain lost markets
and re-establish itself as one of the
primary industrial factors of the West
Coast.
In a test of the new fireproofing
liquid, made at the University of lowa
by the inventor who was formerly a
student there but now is a pharmacist
of Badger, lowa, a block of wood one
halt inch thick was saturated with
the fireproofing and then placed in
running water for twenty-four hours.
After that it was thoroughly dried and
held for one hour over a Bunsen burn
er, which had a temperature of be
tween 700 and 1,000 degrees Fahren
heit, that being a much greater heat,
it is said, than is developed in a con
flagration.
The wood was not burned and only
charred very slightly at the point of
the flame.
The shingle industry has been ex
perimenting with fireproofing paints
and liquids ever since cities first be
gan legislating shingles out of fire
limits. It was found that certain
mercury and zinc salts, and zinc
chloride, for example, prevented com
bustion, but mercury salts are ex
pensive and zinc chloride, which ab
sorbs moisture from the air, ia easily
washed out.
The new compound, is said to have
none of these objections. It is re
ported to be sufficiently low in cost
to make it practical in connection
with shingle manufacture, and when a
shingle is saturated the moisture drys
out leaving an insoluable mineral fire
proofing substance in the fibre cells
of the wood. It cannot be washed
out with water and is said to abso
lutely prevent combustion.
At the University of lowa a rag was
saturated with the new solution, kept
under running water for eight days,
and then could not be made to burn.
A sheet of paper dipped in the pre
paration burned freely until it reach
ed the treated half and then died out.
The preparation is a little heavier
than water; its specific gravity being
1.15. It is said to smell slightly of
amonia. When made with pure chem
icals it is colorless, otherwise it has
a yellowish tinge.
Patent rights are still pending at
Washington, D. C., but just as soon
as the manufacturing rights are avail
able Western Washington Itite-Grade
shingle manufacturers will probably
give it a thorough and practical test.
Wooden shingles combine archi
tecture's basic principle of utility,
beauty and durability, but the use of
these shingles is decreasing because
they are being legislated out of cities
on the theory that they constitute a
fire menace. The invention may
I bring them back in the list of city
building materials and thereby res
tore the lost markets of West Coast
manufacturers. The restoration of
the shingle industry, with the pos
sibility of fireproofing enabling West
Coast manufacturers to exploit Euro
pean markets, would mean many mil
lions of dollars for the people of the
Pacific Northwest.

COMMITTEE
County Committee Meets at

GOV. LISTER NOT OPPOSED
Press Statements Regarding
Opposition to Governor Are
Pure Fabrications.
The Democratic County Central
Committee met in the court house at
Montesano last Saturday and organ
ized with William N. Leeson, of Ho
quiam, chairman, Dr. S. L. Moak, of
Montesano, secretary and J. J. Ander
son, of Elma, treasurer. Fred Straub,
of Hoquiam, who was a member of
the 1913 legislature, was elected state
committeeman. The exfecutive com
mittee is J. A. McGillicuddy, Jr.,
Watson Vernon and F. L. Morgan.
But 31 precincts were represented
at the meeting, there being eight
vacancies in Aberdeen, the Ailing of
which was left to the Aberdeen mem
bers. The vacancies exist in the se
cond precinct of the First ward;
first and second precincts of the se
cond ward; first precinct of the third
ward; second precinct of the fourth
ward; second precinct of the fifth
ward and the first, second and third
precincts of the sixth ward.
Following is the list of committee

John Landers.
The statement sent out to the Har
bor and Sound press from this meet
ing, that there was opposition to Gov
ernor Lister among the democrats, and
that such opposition was an issue at
the meeting was absolutely unfounded,
so far as could be discovered at the
meeting.
There was 110 discussion of candi
dates of any nature, nor any other
sentiment exhibited than the optimis
tic feeling that the state will go demo
cratic in November. There were but
two ballots taken at the meeting, in
which L. B. Bignold and W. N. Lee
son were contestants for the position
of chairman and F, L. Morgan and
Fred. Straub for state committeeman.
The statement referred to would indi
cate that the losing aspirants for those
places were opposed to Lister, which
if true was not in evidence at the
meeting.
The Herald tells It all.

SLIGHTLY COOLER, WITH SLOWLY RISING TEMPERATI "'E. #
FOR SHERIFF
JEFF KARTELL
Nominee on Democratic Tick
et Promises to be Popular
with Voters of All Parties.
DEPENDS ON HIS RECORD
Independent Voters Numerous
this Year. Nominations no
Longer Mean Election.
The old Republican slogan, "Vote
the Ticket Straight," will less
force at the coming elections than
ever before. The tremendous revolt
against the methods of that party's
leaders four years ago was not a hys
terical movement, but rather an ex
pression of an opinion that had been
growing for several years. The steam
rollerlng at Aberdeen and Chicago
were but the natural result of the
method of a set of self constituted
bosses intoxicated with power over a
great party.
This independence of voting can but
be beneficial to the cause of good gov
ernment and it will prove an undisguis
ed blessing if Grays Harbor county
receives a share of it. The absurdity
of electing county officials on party
tickets has at last dawned upon the
public, and on November 7, the names
of candidates under all party design
ations will be scrutinized in an effort
to secure the best regardless of their
views on national policies.
Among those who will receive at
tention is Jeff. Bartell, of Hoquiam,
Democratic nominee for sheriff. The
nomination of Quinn on the Republi
can ticket is said to be unsatisfactory
to many of those who supported him,
and it is said that Bartell will beat
him bad in the home city of both.
Hoquiam.
Bartell is highly recommended by
those who have known him for years,
and he is thoroughly equipped for the
possition. He is 37 years of age, a
native of Detroit, Mich., and served
with credit on the Hoquiam police
force seven years, from 1908 to 1915,
when he resigned to go upon his
farm, on Ford's prairie. Later he re
turned to Hoquiam. where he now re
sides. In the contest for the office
of sheriff. Mr. Bartell will rely upon
his record as a peace officer and as
a citizen of the county.
DUCK DINNER FOR SUNDAY.
Sunday, a fine day anyway, will be
celebrated by many October 1 who
usually give little or no heed to the

by journeying down the "bay" after
ducks and other water fowl —for the
law opens for the slaughter of these
Innocents just after sunrise on this
date. About a week ago. while it
was raining, the lower harbor was
covered with ducks, but the last few
pleasont days has scattered them.
Duck hunting must not begin before
the sun shows up, and must cease
when the sun goes down, but a good
shot, where ducks are plenty, can
usually fill his hag even under these
restrictions.
The old torpedo boat Fox, which
until recently was the training ship
of the Fourth Division Naval Militia
on the Harbor, is now for sale at the
Bremerton yards. Appraised value of
the vessel is placed at $500 by govern

sold for not less than this figure.

WHISKEY BILLED
CANNED SALMON
Over 60 Gallons Taken from
Cargo of Steamer Coronado
on Arrival from California
WORTH SMALL |FORTUNE
Consigned to Klalock Canning
Company, but is Not Claimed
Owners are Unknown.
Lacking judgement In the first place
in labeling cases "Canned Salmon" to
be shipped to Aberdeen —a commun
ity where salmon is canned and ship
ped out, some enterprising person or
persons at San Francisco attempted
to enter here with the cargo from the
Coronado when the vessel was un
loaded at the foot of H street Sun
day night, twenty-two boxes, presum
ably salmon cases, but which contain
ed 11 quarts of liquor, or a total of
more than €0 gallons.
Chief Schmidt, Mayor Phillips and
Captain Searles were present when
the Coronado was discharging her
cargo, and became suspicious of the
cases marked "Canned Salmon—Til
licum Company Brand," consigned to
the Klalock Canning company, this
city. One of the cases was opened,
and the liquor found.
Contrary to first reports, the firm
of Klalock Canning company does ex
ist here; two brothers who are oper
ating on a small scale, but they are
entirely innocent of any connection
with the big booze shipment. The
theory is advanced by the police that
the party who billed the goods from
San Francisco trusted that the con
signment would not excite suspicion
on arrival here and could be claimed
by the true consignee without risk.
If such had been the case, and the
liquor sold through the regular boot
legging channels at prevailing prices
charged for contrabrand liquor, the 60
gallons would have netted a small
fortune.
The booze is being held, and the
police are diligently looking for the
men who were supposed to receive the
stuff.
WILL STOP BAKING
ALL JITNEY LOAVES
Beginning Monday It Will Require a
Dime to Buy a Loaf of
Bread.
As a result of a recent decision of
the master bakers of lioquiam, Cos
mopolis and Aberdeen, there will be
110 more 5c loaves of bread baked
and sold on the Harbor All. the ma
terials that enter into the composition
of bread have been on a steady up
ward trend for some time, and it is
absolutely necessary in order to make
any profit whatever, to either reduce
the size of the 5c loaf, or eliminate
it entirely. The loaf purchased Mon
day, for a dime, will weigh exactly
twice as much as the present 5c
loaf. The saving to the bakers oc
curs in the less labor and time re
quired to bake the double size loaves
of bread. The bakers do not wish to
reduce the weight until it is neces
sary, and are offering the 10c loaf
as the only present solution.
The baker at Montesano still puts
out a 5c loaf, but he has reduced the
weight, offering a loaf, however, for
10c that is about equal to two of his
former 5c loaves.
LISTER STANDS
ON HIS RECORD
Both Candidates for Governor
Have Record of One
Term Served
MUST STAND ON THEM
Friends of Governor Lister
Advance 20 Reasons Why
He Should Win
In the present campaign, the state
of Washington has two candidates for
governor, each of whom have served
a term of four years, so that the vot
er has the record of each for a guide,
and those records are sure to con
front both. By them they must stand.
Governor Ernest Lister is perfectly
willing to rest his claim to a re
election upon the record he has made
during his present term, and his
friends give the following twenty
reasons for his re-election:
1. The state departments under
Governor Lister's control saved and
turned back into the treasury during
his first two years $714,739, or 13 per
cent of the appropriations asked by
the prior republican administration.
2. As a direct result of his vetoes
in 1913, over $4,500,000 was cut from
the appropriations of that legislature
in spite of the fact that appropriations
amounting to $500,000 were carried
over his veto.
3. The Industrial Welfare Commis
sion appointed by Governor Lister has
established the best apprentice sys
tem and the highest minimum wage
of any state in the Union and has far
outdistanced all other states by guar
anteeing a Hying wage to over 75 per
cent of the women of the state em
ployed in gainful occupations.
4. The State Labor Department,
under Governor Lister, has brought
about real co-operation between em
ployers and employees to prevent ac
cidents to workers.
5. Governor Lister has caused the
strict enforcement of the eight-hour,
minimum wage and child labor laws,
procuring in three years 211 convic
tions as against 29 convicltions in the
preceding 16 years.
6. He vetoed the bill to repeal the
eight-hour law on public works.
7. He has established the honor
camp system for prisoners, abolished
dungeons in prisons and correction
cells in the Boys' Training School and
instituted military training in penal
and corrective institutions.
8. Through his efforts there was
established the State School for Girls
and a State School for Adult Blind
(only one other In the Union). He
has caused professional examination
to be made of the blind children with
a view to the restoration of sight, the
first move of the kind ever made in
this state.
9. As the result of Governor Lis
ter's road building policy of "pay as
we go," the Highway Department has
constructed 603 miles of state roads
and gravelled 151 miles of old road
during the past three and onehalf
years without incurring a cent of
bonded indebtedness and the piling
up of interest charges. In the eight
preceding years only 193 miles of
state roads were built.
10. He has inaugurated a system
of state parks along our scenic high
ways.
11. Governor Lister vetoed the in
iquitous Whitney election bill which
attempts to take us back to the day
of boss-controlled conventions and
party-bound candidates, which meas
ure is now before the people on re
ferendum.
12. He vetoed the measures which
propose to nullify the initiative, refer
endum and recall. These measures
are also before the people on refer
endum.
13. He lias stopped petty bicker
ing within and between our state
institutions of higher education.
14. lie lias entirely removed the
National Guard from politics and
brought it to the highest efficiency in
its history, Washington sent the only
full recruited and equipped regiment
.to the border.
15. Upon Governor Lister's re
commendation, an agricultudal de
partment was created to take care of
the growing agricultural interests of
the state.
16. As the result of Governor Lis
ter's close, personal supervision, the
state institutions are in the finest con
dition in their history, and the cost
per inmate lias not been increased.
17. He was instrumental in bring
ing about the speedy survey and plac
ing on the tax rolls hundreds of
thousands of acres of railroad grant
ed and lieu lands, hitherto unsurvey
ed and untaxable.
18. In spite of the most villianous
attacks of the gray wolves of politics,
who sought to hamper him at every
turn, Governor Lister has cleaned up
the Industrial Insurance Department
and brought to justice those guilty of
looting its funds.
19. Notwithstanding the fact that
the fisheries department under Gov-

THE MEASURES
Initiative and Referendum
Measures to be on Ballot
by Numbers Only
OLYMPIA, Sept. 28. —Voters casting
ballots on the initiative and referen
dum measures at the election in Nov
ember will have to read the measures
in order to familiarize themselves with
the proposed laws on which they wish
to vote, according to the copy ballot
sent to the state printer by Secretary
of State I. M. Howell.
For instance, the "picketing meas
ure," as it is known by popular appela
tion, will be printed on the ballot as
Referendum Measure No. 6." It will
not read "for picketing measure," and
"against picketing measure," but will
simply be printed "for referendum
measure No. 6," and "against referen
dum measure No. 6."
Must Read Bill Carefully
It will be seen, then, that in order
for the voter to cast a ballot Intelli
gently he will have to read the pro
posed act.
Instructions as to what his vote "for"
and "against" will mean will not be on
the ballot. The line "To sustain th*
legislative act, vote 'for'," will not
appear above the ballot. Nevertheless
a vote cast for the proposed law, and
a vote against the referendum Is
against the new measure.
STREET TAKES EXAMINATION.
In the recent examination held here
for appointment as lumber expert,
successful applicants to be sent to
Europe to look into the lumber situa

was the only Grays Harbor man to
take the examination. If Mr. Street
passes the preliminary test, he must
report at Washington, and pass an
other, to receive consideration at the
hands of the commission in charge
of the appointments. The number to
be sent to Europe is limited to 10.
