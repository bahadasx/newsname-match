Last week it was our privilege and
pleasure to visit the Fenton school at
Fenton, La., and it gives us pleasure
to say that Jefferson Davis parish has
in that school two efficient, conscien

a successful and pleasant school year

The beautiful, new, modern school
building is pleasantly locaetd on a
large campus, thus affording ample t
room for playground, school garden
and other modern and necessary school
accessories.

wal schools of Jefferson Davis parish,
she well may be prouc' of her rural I

N. Y. WALKOUT IS
. NOT SO CONTAGIOUS
New York, Sept. 28.-Although la
bor leaders insisted last night that
the general strike of trade unionists I
in the greater city in aid of the car
men, eventually would involve At
Ileast a half a million workers, there It
were no surface indications of a tie-up t
of the city's industries as threatened I
after announcement was made that t
the strike had beugn.
While the union leaders claimed that r
125,000 workers in the various trades s
already had joined in the movement, c
with twice as many more ready to n
"walk out" tomorrow, the police said 3
they had received no reports to sub- I
stantiate any such estimates. The ac- d
tual situation, it was said, was con- t
fused because of Jewish holidays f
which are being celebrated here by fi
more than 100,000 union workers. b
POLISHES FOR b
FURNITURE AND AUTO
e
An excellent polish for furniture g
or automobile bodies can be made by g
thinning down boiled linseed oil with s
turpentine, writes the Ohio Extension c,
Service. This applied sparingly to the
clean surface with a cloth and rubbed
briskly with a soft dry cloth, has I
been found very effective in restoring I
the gloss to surfaces that have become
dull.
Another polish favored by some 4
is made from one gallon of turpentine, t
31 ounces citronella oil, 1 pint paraf
fine oil or light cylinder oil and 1½ e
ounces oil of cedar. If the finish on t
a car has become very dull the appear t
ance can be greatly improved by rub
bing with a mixture of cylinder oil I
and kerosene. t
