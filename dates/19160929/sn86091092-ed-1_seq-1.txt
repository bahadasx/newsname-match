THE CALDWELL TRIBUNE, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1916.
WEEKLV, $2.00 PER YEAR
NEXTWEEK IDAHO STATE
FAIR WILL BE GREAT
Next week is southern Idaho's big
week and Caldwell will be the center
of activity, for the Idaho State Fair,
the oldest and largest exhibition in the
state, will throw open its gates for
the 16th annual gathering.
From present indications the fair
this year will be the largest and most
comprehensive in the history of the
association. Reports to Colonel Amos
J. Miller, general manager, from the
superintendents of the different de
partments are optimistic in the ex
treme the various division heads de
claring that the quality and qauntity
of exhibits this year will excel all
previous showings.
To properly handle the large num
ber of entries it has been found neces
sary to enlarge and remodel the ex
hibition halls and to raise tents to
handle the overflow. Manager Miller
has been busily engaged for the last
ten days directing a large force of
workmen in making the necessary al
terations.
Livestock a Feature.
The livestock department in particu
lar promises to be a revelation to even
the most enthusiastic Idaho booster
and will as in former years be one pf
the features of the show. Entries
have been received from all sections
of the state and the showing of swine,
cattle and hors aristocracy will be
complete. In the cattle division nomi
nations have been for herds from
Union and La rande, Oregon, in ad
dition to a large number of Idaho
herds entered and the friendly compe
tition in this department is keen.
The national futurity shows of the
Poland-China and Duroc-Jersey record
associations are attracting wide spread
interest among swine growers and it
is confidently predicted that the swine
show will be the largest held in the
northwest. The two national asso
ciations distribute more than $1100
in cash to successful exhibitors
addition to numreous ribbons and
medals. Winners are also given na
tional publicity through the columns of
the associations official organs. The
futuritv shows are held only at recog
nized state fairs and arouse keen com
petition among breeders.
Youngsters Have Building.
An exhibit that will prove of unusual
interest to fair visitors will be the
school and boys' and girls' clu'b work
The size of the exhibit has made it
necessary to place the entire manufac
turers' building at the disposal of the
youngsters. The exhibit will include
specimens of the childrens work in art,
manual training, domestic science a/nd
general school work. The prizes of
fered aggregate more than $1100, prac
tically all of which will be distributed
to the children of Canyon county. The
display is under the direct supervision
of Miss Z. Fay Fowler, county school
superintendent and Professor W. T.
McCall, county farm supervisor.
Idaho's Productivity Shown.
The spacious agricultural hall will
be crowded with prize winning
samples of the many products for
which Idaho is noted, and to the
skeptical will demontsrate conclusive
ly the wonderful fertility of Idaho soil
Fruits, grains, grasses, vegetables, ber
ries and the countless things growin
in the temperate zone will be found in
abundance and in quality unsurpassed
Practically every producing section in
southern Idaho will have its choicest
products on display and those visiting
the agricultural hall will be amply
repaid and will leave the building with
an abiding faith in the future of Idaho.
Under the direction of Mrs. Mary
Amesbury, assisted by Mrs. M. A
Roberts, Mrs. W. S. Mexey, Miss
Mertis Riddle an others the women's
building is 1>cing tastefully decorated
and the exhibits installed. This year

women's work will be of unsual ex
cellence and variety.

Meek the floral department will be
filled with attractive exhibits.

S. J. JENNINGS WAS
AN IDAHO PIONEER
Life of Toil Devoted to Upbuilding of
State and Betterment of Man.
A great many of tho older residents
of Caldwell and vicinity were well ac
quainted with the late Rev. S. J. Jen
nings, an account of whose death at
Namipa appeared in the last issue of
The Tribune. Rev. Jennings was very
highly respected in this community.
He was a man of great force of char
acter and splendid ability.
The Nampa Leader-Herald in its
issue of September 26, pays a de
served tribute to Rev. Jennings as a
man. The Leatler-Herald says:
Death of S. J. Jennings.
One by one the pioneers who made
Idaho great are passing to their eter
nal reward. Few, very few, will be
missed as much as Rev. S. J. Jen
nings. In the early days his was a life
of activity and arduous toil devoted
to the upbuilding of the state and the
betterment of hi, fcllowmen.
To know him was to be his friend.
It could not be otherwise for he was
the friend of everybody. "As you
measure to your neighbor he will
measure back to you." He measured
bountifully *o all humanity in kind
w^rj. an-! loving dee's and hum.in
ity repaid him in kind. There was
nothing narrow or selfish in his
makeup. He could see some good in
every human being with whom he
came in contact and he loved to
dwell on thtat rather than the frail
ties apparent to those who prefer to
see the evil side of life. It is doubt
ful if in all his long life he ever
spoke an unkind word of any one. To
give joy and comfort was to him a
much pleasanter task than to bring
sorrow or shame. His sympathy was
as broad as the universe and his love
for his fellow men knew no boundär
ies—it was all pervading. He was a
quiet, unassuming man, whose tal
ents were hardly known in his own
community to those not intimately as
sociated with him. To such as were
numbered among his close friends, he
was a great man, endowed with
splendid mind, trained and cultivated
to a high degree.
His name and his blameless life
will long be remembered and revered
by the people, not only of Nampa,
but all southern Idaho, where he la
bored so many years faithfully and
well in the Master's vineyard.
Annual Church Meeting.
Members of the Christian church
met in annual conclave last Tuesday
evening at headquarters an the corner
of Cleveland and Kimball. Members
of the church and their households sat
down at 7:30 to a delicious _ dinner
spread in the bungalow adjoining,
more than a hundred being served.
Following the dinner, a general
exodus was made to the main audti
torium of the church where officers
were chosen for the ensuing year
committee reports were listened to
and other matters of business trans
acted. Mr. J. C. Rice, chairman of the
Board of Officers, presiding.
Rev. Cook, the new pastor,
sponded in happy fashion to a call for
a report of his work since becoming
a Caldwell resident. The report was
more in the nature of a prophesy as to
future accomplishments.
U. T. C.'s Entertained.
Members of the U. T. C. Club, six
teen strong, were entertained last
Tuesday afternoon at the Handy home
on Seventh by Mrs. Brooks.
This periodical sewing-bee was as
usual an unqualified success, the oc

JR. F. M. COLE HOME
AFTER TWO MONTHS
IN THE EAST
Dr. Cole returned Monday morning
from the east, having spent the greater
part of a month in study along surgi
cal lines in a post graduate school in
New York City. Incidentally, he has
been interested in the study of infan
tile paralysis, an absorbing topic in
America's metropolis during the past
summer. The Willard -Parker hospi
tal for contagious disease houses be
tween fourteen and fifteen hundred
cases.
Schools were to open the first Mon
day in September and picture shows
were again thrown open to children,
though the utmost vigilance is still
being exercised to hinder further
spread of the plague.
The theories in regard to the cause
and propagation of this mysterious
disease are paralleled by attempts to
find an effective and certain cure. Its
sysmptoms are so varied and it mani
fests itself in so many different forms.
Contrary toß belief very egenrally pre
valent, except in medical corcles, many
cases escape without a trace of paraly
sis, and unless properly diagnosed and
isolated, such patients became a men
ace to all with whom they come in
contact. It is now believed that the
germs find lodgment in the human
throat, and that adults are more often
carriers of the disease than children.
An examination of the spinal fluid is
an almost certain test, and practically
all suspected cases are now subjected
to it.
Many of the theories advanced in
the early stages of the epidemic have
been exploded, not being able to stand
the test of actual experiment. Milk is
no longer considered a transmitting
agency, and the serum treatment is
not panning out a curative measure.
The medical fraternity and lay mem
bers as well look to this Nineteenth
Century scourge as nothing short of a
calamity, and every effort is being
made to work out a definite treatment
to ipitigate its terrors.
Dr. Cole stopped off in Chicago
where he brushed up on some extras
in post graduate work, joining Mrs.
Cole in Iowa for the return trip.

LIFE INSURANCE.
"Life insurance is the independence,
the bread and clothing and shelter of
the widow and the orphan; the sur»
support of the aged. It is gospel of
material freedom and independence, as
worthy to be taught by the fireside
and proclaimed in public as the gospel
of spiritual salvation."

Monday morning from a month's visit

points, while the doctor took post
graduate work in New York and Chi
cago hosiptals.

knuckles on the washboard, and the

No Baby Show—Infants Ruled Out.
By a joint edict of the fair manage
ment and the local physicians, the
baby show will be eliminated from the
fair attractions next week in this
city. Caldwell assumes that no pre
cautionary measure is too great in an
effort to keep the community free
from the invasion of infantile paraly
sis. so it is in the interests of con
S ervation that the babies have been
, , c k * „ A ni „
«•«. ° f the b« show.
With the terrible malady so preval
ent in the east, the adoption of this
common-sense preventative measure is
most opportune. The congregating of
children in large numbers is not con
sidered a wise move, though the fair
loses in the elimination of the babies
one of its most enjoyable features.
The babies are not worrying o#er
their lost opportunity and will bob up
at the next fair a whole year bigger
and brighter.
Cooked Food Sale.
Teachers of the Washington school
will hold a cooked food sale all day
Saturday in Vanhyning's grocery on
Main street. The proceeds will be ap
plied on the new Victrola for the

DEMURRER OVERULED IN
CASE COUNTY VS.
6. H. MOORE
The demurrer was overruled in the
district court'Tuesday afternoon in tile
case of Canyon County vs. G. H.
Moore, former assessor and tax col
lector, and the United States Fidelity
& Guaranty Co. The defendants were
given 15 days in which to file their
answe r.
Prosecuting Attorney Griffiths
states that he is well satisfied with the
progress made as, so far as this court
is concerned, the county has won. The
case will be ap*" aled.
The suit now in tile courts is for the
1 nc sun now in trie c
recovery nf «t ti7 .,„,1 . . .i
recovery ol 3>J,.51/ and interest at the
rate of 7 per cent, making a total of
$5,076.25.
Judgment of Court.
The court, in the case of Canyon
County vs. Moore, has just handed
down a decision overruling portions
of the demurrer filed by defendant,
Mooretï and the bonding company.
In his decision the court holds that
the facts as pleaded in the complaint,
if prove.n by the defendant, would
avoid the statute of limitations. In his
decision the court also held that the
county was entitled, under the law, to
sue for the recovery o>f money be
longing to cities. It seems that in the
complaint of the County, Assessor
Moore and the bonding company,
verted part of the funds that belonged
to the cities to the county, and the
uiestion was argued in detail as to the
right of a county to sue for monies be
longing to cities. . The complaint of
the county does not show how much
money belonging to the city Assessor
Moore is alleged to^have retained, and
one of the points raised by the de
fendant was that he should b e notified
by the complaint of the county as to
what amount the county claimed lie
had retained from the city, in order
th.U he might properly defend the
same. Upon this point there was no
ruling of the court. The court, in its
decision, gave the defendant 15 days
to answer, and when the defendant's
answer is filed, it will then be de
termined as to what are the issues'in
the case. It is not known at this time
as to. whether a trial can be had and
completed at the fall term of this
court. It is expected in all prob
ability the defendant will require time
to check over the audit made by Ex
aminer Van Deusen, as a number of
years have passed since the alleged
facts complained of happened.
Chautauqua Circle Begins Study.
The Chautauqua Reading Circle for
