VERY SUCCESSFUL
WAS TEACHERS' INSTITUTE
WHICH ADJOURNS TODAY.
Supt. Gilbert, Prof. Rhoads and Miss
Buckner Make Interesting Ad
dresses to Pedagogues.
Addresses by fitate Superinten
dent of Public Instruction V. 0. Gil
bert and State Supervisor of High
Schools McHenry Rhoads were fea
tures of the Lincoln county teach
ers' Institute the latter part of the
week. The institute adjourned this
afternoon. It has been a decided
success in every way and all of the
teachers will return to their schools
benefitted and helped in the work of
instructing the young.
President T. J. Coates, of the
Eastern Normal, who spoke Monday,
remained over that night, and spoke
again.
He discussed some of the teacher's
duties, saying first that the teacher
should know his or her duty in school
both in and out of the class room;
second, that each teacher owes a du
ty to the community in which he or
she teaches and should work in co
operation. Prof. Coates, in a short
but well worded way, told what the
Eastern State Normal stands for,
namely, a good training for teach
ing, by working out the problems
which come up in class room, etc.
Prof. W. P. Robinette, of Kings
Mountain High School, gave an in
teresting talk on the best ways and
means of promoting the interest of
education.
Prof. U. G. Hatfield, of the Crab
Orchard graded school, discussed
means of improvement of teachers,
saying this can best be done by the
teachers attending summer schools,
or reading educational journals and
attending reading circles.
Prof. Cyrus Johnson, of the
Preachersville school, interestingly
the methods of teaching.
An open discussion on Discipline,
led by Prof. IV. G. Benge, of Way
nesburg, was next entered into and
many methods were brought out.
On Wednesday, devotional exer
cises were conducted by Rev. M. D.
Early, followed by a short talk on
the relation of the home, the school
and the church.
Miss Rubie Buckner, head of the
Sewing Department in State Univer
sity, gave a most interesting lecture
on Domestic Science, saying that do
mestic science is the preparation for
complete living. The house-wife
should be trained for her duties as
well as the professional or business
man; she should learn modern meth
ods so as to cut down long hours
and the drudgery of keeping house.
Domestic science also prepares the
g:rl for home living or self support;
al?o they become more economical
and can run .the house at a much
Jess cost. It makes the woman more
business-like. She said that domestic
science should be taught in the rural
schools.
At 11 o'clock, Prof. McHenry
Rhoads arrived and conducted the
institute for the lemainder of the
day. Speaking upon the transition
of 'the pupil from the grades to high
school, he said this is best done if
the teacher in the grades will intro
duce some of the principles of the
high school into the graded work and
for the teacher in the high school to
first familiarize the student with his
new work. Prof. Rhoads then took
up language work in the grades.
After the noon recess, a musical
program was rendered, consisting of
a piano solo, "Witches' Dream," ren
dered by Miss Annette Wearen, and
a violin solo, "Sing Me to Sleep," by
Clarence Singleton, accompanied on
the piano by Miss -Nancy Katherine
McKinney. Both were much enjoy
ed by the audience. The remainder
of the afternoon was given over to
Prof. Rhoads, who talked entertain
ingly on spelling and grammar and
the importance of a reading circle in
each district.
Thursday morning the devotional
exercises were conducted by Rev. D.
M. Walker. Supt. V. O. Gilbert, head
of the State's educational work, gave
a most interesting talk on Character,
saying that the teacher teaches what
he or she really is and not what they
pretend they are. He urged the
teachers to be consecrated in their
work; not to be jealous of another
teacher's success for jealousy is an
acknowledgement of superiority.
At the close of his address he ex
plained the Kentucky School laws
After noon, a musical program,
consisting of a piano solo, "0 Sanc
tissimo," by Miss Frances Embry, a
vocal solo, "Love, Here is My Heart,"
by Miss Katherine Gregory, was
much appreciated.
Supt. Gilbert then discussed the
Teachers' Reading Circle and deem
ed it very important that teachers
should form these reading circles
and keep posted on their profession
as do other provisional and busi
ness men. He urged that they strive
in every way to be a blessing to hu
manity. Rev. D. M. Walter and Rev. P. L.
Bruce gave very interesting talks on
the relation of the country church
to the rural schools.
Reading Circles Organize.
In each of the four rural divisions
in the county, a Reading Circle, has
been formed, for the purpose of the
teachers meeting together once each
month and discussing their work and
to become more efficient. The fol
lowing officers were elected in each
district:
1st. District Prof. W. C. Wilson,
President; Prof. W. R. Todd, Vice
President; Miss Annie McKinney,
Secretary.
2nd. District Prof. U. G. Hatfield
i-resiaenc, uraD urcnara; rroi. nen-jyou
ry Davis, Secretary, Stanford.
3rd. District Prof. W. P. Kobi-
nette, President, Kings Mountain;
. , - , - i
Prof. Smith, secretary.
4th District Prof. Walter Moser,
President, Moreland; Miss Mary Pea
vyhouse, secretary, Hustonville.
The institute closed Friday. It
has been one of the most successful
ever held in Lincoln county. Prof.
W. C. Wilson has made a very able
instructor and made the teachers in
attendance feel that this was their
institute.
The final devotional exercises to
day were by Rev. W. D. Welburn.
The musical program consisted of a
vocal solo, "Little Grey Home in the
West," by Miss Elizabeth Higgins,
who has had charge of the music dur
ing the week.
The remainder of the morning was
taken up in distributing and explain
ing the school laws and school con
tracts by Supt. Singleton.
The institute finally adjourned at
noon.
MORELAND.
The Educational Division No. 4
met at the Institute last week in or
der to arrange for the next Teachers
Association and to elect new officers.
Prof. Robinson presided over the
meeting. Prof. Walter Moser was
chosen Chairman, and Miss Mary
Peavyhouse, secretary. It was de
cided that the next meeting will be
held at the Bellview School at More
land on the first Saturday in Novem
ber, beginning at 2 p. m. The pro
gram committee which consisted of
Prof. Moser, Miss Peavyhouse, Miss
Kate Bogle and Miss Mamie Yancie
has tried to arrange one that will be
of vital importance to all teachers
and very interesting to all outsiders
who desire to attend. This is the
first time the association has ever
been hela at that place and Prof.
Moser cordially requests that all
teachers be present and make this a
record breaking meeting. Most
teachers do not realize how import
ant it is that they should have a self
confidential meeting like this in
which they could discuss the many
problems that confront them. They
should feel more interested in their
work and in that of their neighbor
ing fellow teachers. Refreshments
will be served and an enjoyable as
well as helpful time will be expect
ed. The program is as follows.

a delightful trip of a week thro' the
west, during which he traversed In
diana, Illinois and part of Iowa, go
ing as far west as the great dam on
the Mississippi at Keokuk. Mr.
Minks was accompanied by his wife,
her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Lafe Mor
gan, and Miss Irene Morgan. They
motored through in Mr. Minks' Max
well touring car. The whole tour
was about 2,000 miles and they made
it at a total cost of exactly $27, he
says; This included the cost of re
pairing one tire, which was punctur
ed, a broken spring, hotel bills and
every expense of the entire party.
On the Coast-to-Coast highway, Mr.
Minks says that he macle almost as
high as 40 miles to the gallon of gas
oline. Mr. Minks and party were
gone about a week during which
time Fred Hooper of Danville, op
erated the auto line between the two
cities.
BURGLARS AT BRADFORDSVILLE
Early Tuesday mornine: burglars
entered the store of W. B. Powell, at
Bradfordsville, in which is located the
postoffice. They blew open the safe
in the office with nitro-glycerin, se
cured about $50 in money and made
a clean getaway. Stamps and money
orders in the safe were not molested.
Several people heard the explosion
but thought it was a gunshot. Chief
of Police J. A. Thompson, who went
to the scene with his bloodhounds,
said he believed it was the work of
yeggmen. A trail was struck which
led to a spot not far from where the
robbery was committed and where
an automobile had evidently been
left standing during the night. It is
the general belief that the robbers
came-and left in a car.

here and we want all to know that
finer discourses have not been heard
in this church for years than he is
delivering. . He is an earnest, zeal
ous man, coming here for his health,
and seeing the condition of this
church, he felt that altho not phy
sically able to do the work, he could
not keep from it and he was invited
by the members to stay and preach
ind such refreshing, awakening ser
mons should be heard by every de
nomination and those who fail to
hear him have indeed lost something
that was worth while. The sermons
Sunday morning and evenintr were
I deeply appreciated and inspired all
wno listened wun greater errorts to
work for the Master. Rev. Clere of
Lancaster, is conducting the morning
service and everyone who ever heard
him knows what a feast awaits them

ueo. btephenson managed the affair
and the srellers enjoyed defeat as
much as success. Mrs. Maggie Fish
won the prize, a huge box of fine
candy. A most interesting addition
to the spelling match were speech
es by several little grown-ups. Mr.
Thomas Lyne rendered in his very
best style, "Counting Hiney's Geese"
which brought down the house. Mr.
Ed Gooch, our postmaster, spoke
"Simple Simon," leaning forward to
be prompted every line by Mr. Skiles
and the piece was snoken as Iia ron.
Idered at the age of five or six
years. He received many cheers
and the little folks simply squealed.
"Stage Fright," by Mr. Skiles; "The
Bramble Bush," by Mr. J. Thomas
Cherry and a fine poem entitled
"How Things Are Managed at Killi

greatly enjoyed. Little Willie Pet

speech and when his time came, he
flew through the door like a meteor,
while a lady ran to catch him by the
coat but could not stop his flight or
soothe his fright. Mr. T. J. Coburn,
a visitor at the Sanders Hotel, was
present, and entertained everyone
with his marvelous slight-of-hand
tricks. Altogether it was a most en

I OIL UNDER LINCOLN
LEASES BEING TAKEN IN ALL
SECTIONS OF COUNTY
Pennsylvania Oil Paper Says Indica
tions Are Estill Fields Extends
In This Direction.
Land is being leased all over Lin
coln county for oil and gas experi
mental drilling with the exception of
the northern part of the county. The
gradual tracing of the Estill county
oil field in this direction confirms
more strongly than ever the opinion
that old-timers have held for years
that there is a great pool of oil lo
cated somewhere under Lincoln
county soil. Almost every foot of
land around Crab Orchard has been
leased to oil concerns, and leases are
being taken in the South End and
also south of McKinney and Huston
ville. Oil indications are very pro
nounced south of Crab Orchard, and
the same is true south of Stanford.
The gas well on the farm of M. S.
Baughman still supplies his home
with light and fuel, and has done so
for years. A similar well supplied
Mrs. McCarty with light at Mt. Sa
lem until an effort to strengthen it
by blasting a larger opening, closed
up the original outlet entirely.
The underlying pool is thought
to extend southwest into Casey. The
story is told of a farmer near Dunn
ville, years ago, who started a flow
of oil so strong, while drilling a wa
ter well, that it ran into the creek
and being set on fire, caused a fear
ful conflagration up and down the
stream. This was before the value
of oil was anything like present day
figures and this well was plugged up
to prevent pollution of the stream.
It is said by old residents to have
been a real gusher.
The Oil City Derrick, published at
Oil City, Pa., and recognized as the
official oil paper of this section of the
country had the following about the
oil situation in Kentucky which will
be of interest to everyone in this sec
tion who hopes to see a big strike
made in Lincoln county:
The development of the fields of
Kentucky from an average of about
1,000 barrels daily to 6,000 barrels
per day, has been accomplished
within a few months. It is only one
of those surprises that make the oil
business a fascinating one. Kentuc
ky a year ago was one of the states
that oil men refused to consider se
riously. They argued that too much
money had been spent there to make
it possible for any hope to remain
of developing paying pools. Past
experience counted for little and
they had forgotten that just before
Sisterville brought West Virginia to
the fore that oil men believed that
State was worthless asset to the pe
troleum industry. In fact at that
time there had been tests made in
practically every one of the present
oil counties of West Virginia and the
development at Burning Springs and
Eureaka were the only ones that had
been discovered. West Virginia at
that time had been more thoroughly
tested than has Kentucky today, for
there are many counties in the latter
State that have never had a test.
The discovery of what is believed
to be a paying well in the Clinton
sand at Irvine, offers new possibili
ties for the oil development of the
State. It is not as yet certain that
the well will prove a paying produc
er, but the fact that oil has been
found in the formation is a pointer
for further operations. West of a
line from Ashland, thru Cannel City,
Jackson and to Barbourville, it would
not be wise for any test to stop be
fore penetrating the Clinton. Along
this line some of the Cow Run sands,
the salt, Keene, Big Injun and cor
niferous would be found. There is
not much hope for the Devonian
sands but there are too many sur
prises in oil developments to state
that they would not prove productive.
West of this line the formations shal
low rapidly and many of them come
out to the surface before Estill coun
ty is reached. Beyond that county
and south of Cincinnati is a large
area where the Niagara and Trenton
rocks reach the surface, and in this
scope of country there is no proba
bility of finding oil. All the upper
sands have "gone up in the air."
From Boyle, Washington, Lincoln
and Madison counties, the Trenton
and Niagara dip below the surface
again to the south, and here the up
per sands are found. A good well
is reported near Edmonton, Metcalf
county in this section; claiming a
production anywhere from 10 to 40
barrels. It is purely a wildcat and if
is proves a paying proposition, will
open a new pool. The curious feature
of the location is that a line drawn
from Irvine in Estill county, to the
Scottsville pool, passes to the well.
The pools are not regular. Dry
holes and small wells are found, but
the producing wells appear to have
good staying qualities. Reports have
been received by Derrick which state
that some of the wells show an in
crease since the owners have been
able to pump them steadily with the
advent of the pipe lines.
That Kentucky holds great future
possibilities for the oil men, has been
proven. This time it will be thorough
ly tested, and then the overtow will
work into Tennessee, a State which
at present is not looked upon with
any favor by the oil producers.
