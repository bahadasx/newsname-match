medical supplies. A hospital corps
detachment was accordingly rushed
to the scene by train.
It is stated that the garrison at
CusihuiricMc cooperated with the
forces of Ramos, but whether they

originator of the idea of cutting off
the ears of captured government sol

' SARATOGA SPRINGS, N. Y., Sept.
28. Charles E. Hughes tonight told
the Republican unofficial state con
vention here why he had not urged
Republican senators to filibuster to
the last against the passage of the
Adamson eight hour law passed to
evert the threatened railroad strike.
The nominee declared he did not be
lieve in filibustering, for 'one thing,
and that if the majority in congress
had determined to pass the bill there
was no reason whatever why its pas
sage should have been delayed by fili
bustering tactics.
"It (the administration) acted with
swiftness," said Mr. Hughes, "and it
frtno, pow crythat a Republican can
. iJate a thousand miles away should
have saved it from carrying out its
fixed determination."
A question asked by Richard Olney,
secretary of state under President
Cleveland, ps to why Mr. Hughes had '
pot urged Republican senators to fill- I
buster against the bill, was made the
, . , . , ..
occasion for Hughes declaration.
He said: )

The big guns are designed

Fourteen inch or sixteen-inch
guns can be carried in greater
