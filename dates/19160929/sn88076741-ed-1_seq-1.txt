THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
The event of the week is another ad
vance of the French and English on the
Somme. At* the time of the first great
advance the first week of July three
strongholds of the German lines were
left, Theipval, Colombes and Perrone.
The entente allias passed these and
went on. Later with further advance
these points were more or less encircled
and lust week Oolombes was nearly sur
rounded. On Saturday and Sunday the
.English took Thiepval by assault and
the English and French each entered
Colombes on opposite sides. They r»
'jport a large amount of food- and muni
tions found at Colombes.
In the Balkans reports are conflicting
except that there is considerable tight
ing, both sides claiming successes but
nothing decisive. There is very hard
battling going on along the Russian
lines in Galicia. So far the German
Austrian armies have forced the Rus
sians to a standstill as far as progress is
concerned and the results are still in
doubt though Berlin claims success,
while fetrograd says but little.
Greece is practically in a state of
»OB politically but the expectation is
-•Vv.
-V 6
*. fvl
that it will declare war against the
Teutonic alli'« »oon. Part of the coun
try is now in open rebellion.
A feature of the war news is the great
increase in aerial warfare. Great fleets
of scores engage each other as well as
drop bombs on enemy towns.
EDUCATION.
Just now after, vacation we begin our
yeaUy educational campaign.
The boys and girls from the primary
grades to the university, from "A" to
Algebra, are startin'g or continuing along
the eduoational roads. Some of these
are also going out as teachers, some as
teachers of country schools, some in
graded departments, some in the higher
seats of learning.
We are all proud of our. schools, we
are all proud that our schools are com
mon schools. That they are common,
where the rich and the poor meet on a
common level, where eaoh absorbs from
the others that community of interests
that makeB them tolerant of each other,
which is the true foundation of future
good citizenship.
But in our zeal for scholarship we
have to some extent forgotten facts for
theories. We have run by the printed
p&ge rather than by actualities. We
steer by compass when we should look
at the land in the clear sunlight. We
are running to fads and forgetting foun
dations.
All knowledge is of value. But mere
knowledge in itself is of little value. An
elevator filled with wheat is of value,
not because it is wheat in an elevator
but because it can be used, can be
ground into flour and made into bread.
The real aim of all education is use.
It isn't what one has learned at school
but what can he or she do when they
leave school. For instance, how many
high school graduates can read, write
and spell? How many can read with
the spirit and the understanding? How
many can write a brief, clear, business
letter? How many can write a legible
neat hand? How many can measure a
pile of cord wood, lay out an acre of
land, add up a short column of figures,
etc, or readily perform any number of
the thousand and one questions that
come every day to the business man or
farmer or clerk?
Why should it be necessary for the
high school graduate to go to a "busi
ness" college to complete hiB education?
If we were to say what we think is the
great trouble with preseftt day methods,
we should remark that the whole pro
gram from primary to high is made to
prepare the young idea for the univer
sity or the normal school. All educa
tional roads seem to run to Grand Forks,
Fargo, Mayville or some other educa
tional center.
Universities and normals are useful
and valuable, We are pleased to see
them well attended and. we wish more
pupils were able to go than now do.
But it is a fact that a very small propor
tion of common school pupils go to the
higher schools and this a fact that
should be thought of when the "doctors
of school laws" write the educational
programs.
Along the lines of new teachers we
have the same difficulties. Under the
educational program they have been
taught all sorts of syohological theories
about teaching in the normal courses,
and a normal course is practically obli
gatory before they can get certificates.
They go out to the country schools with
a big box of tools but when they get at
work, like the carpenter, they find that
the saw, hammer and square build
houses, while the other tools are only
used occasionally.
Normal schools nevei made one single
teacher.
A farmer was never made with books.
Teachers are born so.
Normals and books are a great heip
but they cannot create.
No matter how abundant the tools a
man without hands or arms cannot use
them.
This writer believes in the higher edu
cation where possible, but in Pembina
we have about 250 children at school
and there are perhaps a dozen graduates
now attending universities and normals.
That is a solid fact. Think it over you
educators.
The "profession" of teacher is con
fined to the few. The most of the teach
ers are merely teaching'as a temporary
makeshift. It is so. It always bas been
so.
That's another fact. Why try to the
orize these into professionals?
WHERE ARE WE AT?
Some weeks ago after the June prima
ries we asked «this 'question. After the
lapse of two months we are still groping
for an answer.
The results of the primary were out
inei at that time and have turned out
*1 ?. r,-r^»^£ -r^"^ *~v"
.*'•
as expeoted. The Nonpartisan people
took ohaige of the Republican organiza
tion by force of numbers and we have
the rather singular spectacle of the suc
cessful jnajority openly supporting many
democratic state and legislative candi
dates though perhaps we should qualify
by saying one Democratic state candi
date.
Personally the Nonpartisans selected
a good man for candidate for governor?
Mr. Frazer was brought up near the
boundary line between Pembina and
Walsh counties, is well eduoated, and is
a man of strong personality. While he
is committed tp some of the rather fad
dish theories of the Nonpartisan party
yet we believe that he is a man of good
hard sense and that when the responsi
bilities of the state fall upon his shoul
ders that he will be conservative and
that be will not be under the ponttol of
any man but himself. We think that
Mr. Frazer when elected will be govern
or—himself.
As to tlie other state officers oo the
Republican ticket, they are looking for
a job. That does not mean anything
wrong. Their offices do not mean much
politically, they are mostly of a purely
business and clerical nature. Few vot
ers will or can know as to the personal
fitness of these as they cast their bal
lots. Some of them are being re elected
and others are new. The records of the
former are known and the latter have
the recommendations of their friends.
The more curious political situation is
that of the candidates for the supreme
bench. Under the law this selection is
supposed to have been taken out of par
tisanship, but under the facts it has be
come the greater political issue of the
state campaign
There are two sets of candidates, the
old oues seeking re election while there
is anew set endorsed by the nonpartisan
party. On these candidates both the
Republican and Democratic parties will
vote indiscriminately in November.
Personally, we do not like the Nonpar
tisan candidates because they have prao
tically pledged themselves to make judg
ments favorable to the Nonpartisan
theories in advance. Certainly that is
not a proper thing for a prospective
judge to do. On the other hand, we
have but little regard for the former
judges as judges. But that is personal
to this writer only, who cannot forget
the county seat decisions. But by the
same token those former judges are en
titled to about 2,800 votes in this county.
Our friends, the Democrats, are in
perhaps the worst condition for many
years. Always badly divided in this
state, the accidental return to powe.r of
the Democrats, made things worse by
scattering political plums among their
partisans which has resulted in a gener
al row and asoumes the proportions of a
riot.
Our old time, Pembina county boy,
Fred McLean, has been elected as chair
man of the Democratic state committee
and he and McArthur, who was selected
at the June primaries as candidate for
governor, are admittedly and publicly at
swords points and the committee is divi
ded into two factions accordingly.
There has been talk of court proceed
ings to oust McLean, because while
chairman he is not a member of the
committee, while McArthur has announ
ced his candidacy independent of the
committee.
The national ticket including the sena
torial and congressional delegations will
doubtless be voted pretty straight wbic^i
means that North Dakota will go Re
publican by a large majority.
As to state candidates tbe state will
go Nonpartisan-republican, or Republi
can-nonpartisan as will appear later.
But for a truth state politics were
never so muddled as at present in both
of the leading political parties.
A TIME TO BE OPTIMISTIC.
(Prom The Search Light, Fargp, Aug. 19.)
The poor crops of Minnesota, North
Dakota and South Dakota is an unfor
tunate condition of course, but the pro
pie should not be pessimistic or blue.
While we will have to limit expenses
somewhat, we are at the beginning of a
sounder foundation for future operations
on the farm.
In the seventies, southern Minnesota
had three crop failures in succession,
the first one being well on a par with
the present condition of crops in the
three stales just mentioned. At that
time the farmers in that section of Min
nesota bad paid but little attention to
diversified farming. The crop failures
compelled a change and inside of five
years after the crop failures, the people
of that section were on the high road to
success through diversified farming, and
have been ever since.
North Dakota is now at the bottom
jung of tbe ladder that leads upward to
successful diversified farming. The
people will adopt diversified farming

now with enthusiasm, and subdivide the
farms so that they can handle them.
While the poor crops this year must
necessarily curtail expenses and to some
extent perhaps temporarily embarass
some of the people, yet they are opening
the door to assured successful farming
hereafter, and if consequence optimism
should prevail, instead of pessimism.
At no time has the Red river valley and
North Dakota generally seemed more
inviting to the writer, than now.
The annual convention of the Tri.
County Teacher's Association, made up
of Pembina. Walsh and Grand Forks
counties,1 will be held in the city of Graf
ton, October 12 and 13. The officers of
the association have met and made up a
tentative program. The sessions of the
association will be held at the auditor
ium of the high school and will be pre
sided over by F, W. Reinoehl, of Lari
more, president of the association. The
other officers are C. B. Curtis, vice-pres
ident, Pembina Miss Nellie B. Hanson,
secretary-treasurer, Grafton and Miss
Johnstone, Grand Forks, and Miss Jones
Cavalier and E. Erickson Grafton, exe
cutive committee. It is expected that
between two and three hundred people
will be present at the various sessions.—
