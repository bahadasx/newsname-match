LAND OFFICE NEWS
VISITS LAS CRUCES LAND OFFICE
The local United States commis
sioner was n visitor at tho Las Cruces
land office the last of the week looking
into the status of several entries,
making a few naps and getting ac
quainted with tho officiont and courte
ous "force" of the land office for this
district.
John L. Burnsidc, the receiver, who
is formerly of Silver City and widely
known throughout tho southwest, is
in charge of tho. registering of tho
transactions before tho land office, and
S. P. Ascarotc, a well known Doiin
Ana county resident, is receiver of tfio
moneys of the office. N. C. Cross, A.
T. Johnson nnd Mrs. L. K. Llewelyn
compose the efficient nnd well versed
clerical staiT of the land office. Mr.
Cross is in charge of the money re
ceipts, mineral applications, land sales,
etc. Mr. Johnson acts on contests,
final proofs, posting on tract nnd serial
register books. Mrs. Llewelyn nttends
to general correspondence nnd assists
in the sundry capacities, nil of which
require export attention and surely
receive it.
The work of tho office is carried on
in r most systematic yet simple mari
ner and no little pains is extended In
keeping up the multitudinous require
ments of the government, by the offi
cials of tho office.

etc., in tho average township is no little
work. There are no mnps to copy
from as one may believe, but tho com
piler uses the tract book, marking oh
the plot, section by section, tho land
entered, (each section a page on tho
tract book). Maps purchased at the
price set by the government are well
worth the money.

Fire Totally Destroys
Scott Garage
Blazo Sweeps RirTi Big Garage
Twclvo Cars Reduced To Ashos
Loss About $20,000
One of the most destructive fires in
tho history of Lordsburg swept
through the Scott garage at the cor
ner of Railroad Ave., nnd Main street, '
Tuesday night at 11 o'clock, reducing!
the building and contents to ashos
within an hour's time. Twelve auto
mobiles wore in the garage at the timo
of the fire and nil wcro totally,
destroyed. Reside the automobiles
there was a now shipment of tiros
and casings, a $3,000 stock of acces
sories and automobile parts, oxygen
welding plant, machine shop, ofllco
fixtures nnd books and the possessions
of several employees.
The blazo was discovered at 10M5
p. m. by an employee of the garage
who was returning from his lunch.
Flames were then devouring the renr
end or work-shop part of the building.
The man rushed into the building and
awakened Eugene Montague, one of
tho owners of tho garage, and Earlo
Lambert, an expert mechanic, both
sleeping in the front part of the build
ing. They scantily dressed nnd rushed
into the store room where the cars
were put up for the night. Mr. Mon
tague succeeded in getting one car
out of the building and Mr. Lambert
was burned while rescuing a $0,000
Spa racing car. Both men dashed
back into the garage in nn effort to
save more cars and at least the account
books but by this time the flames had
enveloped the full 200 feet length of
the building. Like blasts from a
furnace the blaze attacked the cars,
oil tanks on front to tho office anil to
the gasoline tanks. It was impossible
to get within ten feet of the building
and nil parts of the garage were in a
mass of flames. Iiy the time nn alarm
was sounded the place was beyond
control and burned to the ground
without so much as a drop of water be
ing played on the blaze.
S. M. Chnse, who was first to reach
the fire, saved the Ford truck of thu
Eaglo Drug .Mercantile Company,
which was outside the building. Other
willing workers were present to aid
whenever needed but nothing could bo
done to retard the fire or save any
thing within the building.
The cars in the garage which wcro
totally destroyed were:
New White touring car, Thomas
Lyons of Gila, N. M., owner. Value
$6,000.
Cndillac touring car, Earlo Lambert,
owner.
Ford touring car, Dr. Williams.
Ford touring car, "Spooks" Burke.
Grant "Six", owner, transient.
Overland touring car, owner, tran
sient. Overland touring cur. owner, Kunion
Campos.
Studebaker "4", owner, A. Kodcil
(Uez. The Scott garage hail three cars of
their own, which were being rebuilt,
in the machine shop. The.io wore also
burned to ashes.
The account books, cash register,
and all office supplies were reduced to
a crisp. Two full tanks of giiHolinc
which were outside the building wen
rescued. Late until Wednesday u
blaKc hovered over the oil tanks in tho
garage,
Tho prigin of the firo is still unac
counted for. It is certain that the
olaae began In the work-shop but from
what source, novor has bcun determin
ed. The Scott Garage has suffered a
loss of ovor $10,000, the property and
contents boing only partially insured
owing to tho extremo high rate on the
pl.ice. The building and supplies wore
all owned by N. J. Scott nnd Eugene
Montague.
Mr. Scott was in Los Angeles at the
time of tho firo. Ho was notified by
wire and arrived home Thursday
morning.
Messrs. Scott nnd Montague had i
just succeeded, by hard work, to feet
their business on a paying basis. For j
two years they had labored hard in
getting a modern work-shop and a1
full line of supplies and accessories 1
and were well on the road to success
when t)ic disastrous firo came. Tho
efforts of two years were reduced to
ashos in twenty minutes.
In November Mr. Scott suffered the
loss of his household goods when ifls
residence, north of the S. I'. tracks,
burned.
It is likely that Scott and Montague
will rebuild their garage at once.

All that Is needed is impetus to thp

Fire is Lordsburgs greatest menace.
Whnt will YOU do about it?
It is up to YOU. 1
MINES AND MINING
BONNEY MINE MAKES PROGRESS.
The unwntcring of the Bonnoy
mine has been completed and the com
pnny is now about to begin breaking
ore on the fourth level.
This work was started several weeks
ago and excellent progress has been
made. When operations wcro sus
pended some months ago the company
had just cut a ledge of some of the
highest grade ore ever encountered in
this camp but when tho station wns
cut a heavy flow of wntcr prevented
further progress. Adequate pump
ing machinery is now installed and the
water is being taken care of while
mining is done.
The Bonney mino is certain to be
come one of the highest grade and best
paying propositions in the camp.
