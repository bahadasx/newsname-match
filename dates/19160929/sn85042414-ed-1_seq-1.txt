F. O. Hellstrom Praises Uni

NOT SPLIT, SAYS

Maintains.
(Herald Special Service.)
Bismarck, N. D., Sept. 29.—A "love
feast" was held last night at the
auditorium in honor of former Gov
ernor John Burke, candidate for
United States senator.
F. O. Hellstrom, Burke's opponent
at the primaries and slated by rumor
makers to run independently against
him at this election, presided.
In an eloquent talk praising Burke,
he wished away all members of the
feud that has been one of the choice
bits of democratic conversation. When
first he referred to Burke, pausing
in the midst of his talk and swinging
.his arm back towards the United
(States treasurer seated on the plat
Iform, he declared that: "my friend
|will tell you more of that." The
audience that filled the large hall
lore than two-thirds broke out with
|oud applause. Governor Burke, in
lis tails, took exception to Hughes
loubting the word of Bryan, when he
^aid that he had not told the Austrian
embassador that the notes to Ger
many did not mean what they said.
'No matter what, they have said or
[thought of Bryan, no one before has
Joubted his true sincerity and his
Sterling honesty." Burke declared.
This was greeted with cheers for
Jryan.
"There is no truth," said Geo. E
Wallace, member of the state tax com
fission and a democratic leader, "in
pe rumors that the democratic party
split. It is solidly behind John
jjjurke for senator."

PAGEANT PICTURES
TO BE SHOWN SOON
Motion Picture Films Reach the City
Today—to Be Exhibited at
Local Theater.
The moving pictures of the original
tercentinary masque, "Shakespeare,
Playmaker" given at the Bankside
theater by the Sock and Buskin so
ciety of the University of North Da-'
kota last June, have arrived in the
city and will be presented at a local
play house within the next week or
ten days, according to an announce
ment mad*-today by Professor Fred
erick H. Kbieh, director of the masque.
The pictures *f the community
pageant were taken by E. F. Seavolt
of Minneapolis, photographer for the
Lochren Film company. Mr. Seavolt
has taken special feature pictures for
the Pathe Weekly and the Northwest
Weekly. He is recognized as one of
the leading photographers in the
country and has done an excellent
piece of work in portraying the uni
versity masque.
Scenes from the entire pageant will
be flashed upon the screen with ex
Dlanatlons sufficient to make clear tr
anyone not having seen the pageant
the different features of the masque
that characterized it as one of the
two great community pageants of the
y4ar.
While definite arrangements for the
presentation of the pictures have not
been completed by Professor Koch, he
expects to be able to announce the
date and place where the pictures will
be shown in the very near future.
Moving pictures of commencement
day at the University of North Dakota
will also be shown in connection with
the pageant pictures. The commence
ment pictures are reported to be ex
ceptionally fine and should prove a
great attraction in the city when they
are exhibited.
TAG DAY PROVED

Last year this city gave to this pur

not take part in a "war" cabinet.
"Could President Wilson have
made war on a European country?"
he asked. "The constitution has
taken the power to declare war out

Chinese officials have, apparently,
never conceded the absolute autonomy
of Outer Mongolia. The foreign office
is unwilling to admit that the mem
bers designated to represent Mongolia
when parliament was first convened in
1913 should not now take their seats
Furthermore the question is raised as
to the validity of the Russo-Japanese
treaty granting autonomy to Outer
Mongolia. Republican leaders say
the treaty is not valid,, as Yuan Shi
kal negotiated It without the ratifica
tion of parliament. Originally twelve
Outer Mongolian senators and fifteen
Mongolian representatives were desig
nated to sit in the two houses of par
liament. Ten were Chinese, five
Manchus and twelve Mongolians.
Russia's absolute control of Outer
Mongolia Is well known to all persons
in official life in the Far East. Trad
ing with the enemy regulations in
Outer Mongolia Is quite the same as
they are In Russia. The Hutuktu of
Urga, who is the real ruler of Outer
Mongolia, is under absolute Russian
domination.
So far Outer Mongolia has not offi
cially stated whether it desires to be
represented in the Chinese parlia
ment. However, in view of Russia's
control of Outer Mongolian affairs, it
Is believed that the Hutuktu will de
cline representation at Peking if he
be called upon by Russia to make a
decision in the matter.

ADAMSQN BILL NEVER
WILL BE REPEALED
So Declares Senator Thomas J. Walsh,
in ail Address to Iroquois Club
of Chicago,
Chicago, Sept. 29.—Senator Thomas
J. Walsh of Montana, western dem
ocratic campaign manager, asserted in
an address to members of the Iroquois
club last night that the Adamson
eight hour law never will be repealed.
"It is vain," proclaimed the speak
er, "to declaim about the iniquity
of legislation under coercion. The
man who might have arrested the
passage of the act, had he but raised
his voice, remained silent. He may
rail at it, but he must share respon
sibility for its passage. How much
more virtuous is he who might have
prevented passage of the act. but did
not, than he who voted for it. Had
Candidate Hughes sent and published
a telegraphic message to the republi
can members of the senate to stand
firm, to take advantage of the rules
of the senate to prevent the passage
of the Adamson bill, it would not now
lie the law. He shrunk from that
awful responsibility, as well he
might."
Senator Walsh said that congress
must now address itself to legislation
which will forever prevent the re
currence of a similar situation.
Hope to Organize
Country's Engineers
New York, Sept. 29.—The prelim

L. Saunders, second vice chairman of
the naval consulting board, called the

form a permanent body of the en
gineers now serving on the commit
tee on industrial preparedness of the
naval consulting board. The proposed
organization would not concern itself
with mechanical or scientific work but
with civic affairs exclusively, Mr.
Saunders declared-
Members of the naval consulting

and editors of engineering magazines
attended the meeting. A committee
on organization was appointed to com
