DYSPEPSIA MAN'S
GREATEST ENEMY
Distressing Malady Has Baffled
, the Medical Profession
for Many Years.
Explaining the record-breaking
demand for Taulac, G. F. Willie
Southern representative for L. T
Cooper, manufacturer, of the cele.
brated medicine, stated recently in
Atlanta that the thousands of ques
tions that were being asked all over
tlm South regarding it make it im
, perative that some explanation be
made to satisfy public interest.
Speaking of Tanlac, he said
'Thousands of the most prominen
people, in fact, in the leadiiig cities
oE the country, where this celebrat
ed medicine has been accomplish
ing such remarkable results, are
even more enthusiastic over Tanlac
than Mr. Cooper himself.
"In explanation of this, it shoulc
be stated that Tanlac is believed to
bo thejSrst actually direct specific
for catarrhal inflammation of . the
stomach, or what is more common
y known as dyspepsia, and the
complications which follow it."
At this point Mr. Willis quoted
from one of Mr, Cooper's recent
lectures, in which he said: "Of
all the distressing conditions that
afflict humanity, chronic dyspepsia
is probably the most prevalent.
This most universal maladv has
baffled the medical profession for
for years, and the most skilled spe
cials have been uuable to cope with
it successfully.
"Hours might be consumed in
describing the sufferings, mental
fuirl rhvsirAl. nf t.li anffflrern nf
chronic dyspepsia, and their failure
heretofore to get relief. A morbid
u ureal, whimsical and melancholy
condition of the mind, aside from
the nervousness and physical suf
fering, is the nsnal conditions nf
or
the average, dyspeptic, and life
seems scarcely worth the living.
Dyspepsia, or indigestion, as the
case may be, is caused by the tak
ing of too much food, or unsuitable
food, aud the mucous membrane
of the stomach becomes irritated,
and there is set an acute or sub
acute gastric catarrhal conditions,
which prevents the proper diges
tion of the food. This food is apt
to. ferment and decompose, and as
b result the familiar, distressing
fsyratoms of dyspepsia may arise.
In mild cases there is nothing
more than an uncomfortable feel
ing in the stomach, with a certain
amount of depression, headache,
loss of appetite, perhaps belching
of gas and occasional vomiting.
There may be also accompanying
atipation, paius in the back, colic,
etc. There may be only the fa
miliar heartburn due to inflamation
of the stomach from excessive
gaases of fermentation or putrefac
tion. In the most severe cases
those that last over a day or two
tlm symptoms enumerated may be
much more intense. The djstress
may be marked, and the general
constitutional symptoms more evi
dent. When this stage is reached
tl-'i loss of appetite, tlie menial de
jMvjssion and the general uncom
fortable feeling of the stomach ate
Much more pronounced. This is
particularly tru of gastritis.
Mlt frequently occurs from con
tinned errors iu diet. that this con
dition becomes chronic and the
symptoms persist for au indefinite

ed, there is a 'bad taste in the
mouth, and there are changes in
tue amount or the salivary secre-
tion. Constipation is also usuallv
present, although diarrhoea may
alternate,
Most cases of dyspepsia can be
cured, if the diet is properly looked
after and with the proper treat-
ment. Proper eating and . the
proper amount of food are the
most important features in the
treatment. Most people eat too
fast and eat too much.
,fOneof the most riernicioiia of
all practices in the treatment of
dyspepsia is the promiscuous tak-
ing of the so mapy so-called pro-
prfetary medicines which are so
blantly advertised in the daily
press, many of them being nothing

For consider him that endured
such contradiction of
aSHlnst himself, lest ye be wearied
and faint in your minds (Hebrews
xii 3. ) Reader, you who profess to
be Christians, will do well to "heed
the above admonition of the
Apostle Paul as he writes to those
Jewish Christians, trivine them

tian race
He reminds them that Judaism
had come to au end through the
fulfillment by Christ of the whole
purpose of the law. He points out
to them the fact that the life of
Christ is their example, the pattern
after which they should model
their lives.
"Consider him." The failing to
consider Jesus aud the life he lived
is the one great and main reason
why so many .who begin the Chris
tian warfare play false to and fall
out of the service of Christ.
They go where he would not go.
They talk as he would not talk.
They deal with their fellow men as
he, would not. They do not live
the prayerful life he lived. They
do not forgive their enemies as he
did. They do not go to church as
he did. They do not use the word
oiuouas ue uiu, tnereiore, mere
18 uo wonder that they fail.
We should, as Paul urges on the
Hebrew Christians, keep him be-
