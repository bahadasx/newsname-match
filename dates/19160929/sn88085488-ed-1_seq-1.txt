BREEZE ADDS TO
FARM HOLDINGS
S. ii. Breeze, the prosperous farm
er residing four miles south of Pull-!
man, ibis week added 320 acres of!
fine farm land to his holdings when!
he closed a deal with B. T. Coman
of the Exchange National bank, Spo
kane, for the balance of the old Ezra
Monlux farm, bringing his total
acreage to 740 acres, comprising the :
entire farm formerly owned by the
late Mr. Monlux and later sold to
Mr. Coman. The price paid was $75
per acre, or $24, I for the 320
acres. Mr. Breeze worked as a farm
hand for Mr. Monlux 18 years ago,
later purchasing the big [farm in ■
small parcels as he could handle it.
until he has become the owner of the
entire 740 acres.
SCRIMMAGE BEGINS
FORW.SXWARRIORS
Team's Hopes liaise With Return e.i
Zimmerman and Langdon Four*
teen Letter Men Now on Hand '
t
Battering, plunging and dashing
as though the championship of the j
world were at stake', Coach Lonestar!
Dietz's "first team," composed al
most entirely of old letter men. I
Wednesday night piled up a lopsided !
yardage against the new men on the J
squad, all of whom were given an
opportunity to stop a few of the pow
erful, well-timed plays drilled into
the veterans last year in a manner
that spelled the championship of the
Pacific coast. The neophytes put up
a valiant, stubborn fight, winning
the commendation of the side-line
fans by their gameness, but there
was no gainsaying the power of the j
veterans. It was the first actual:
scrimmage of the year and while
every man fought hard, not even a 1
minor injury resulted.
Coach Dietz's squad now numbers
65, 14 of whom won their letters last
year. The hopes for a second cham
pionship were greatly Increased this l
week by tha return of Langdon, last
year's all-Northwest center, and
Clarence Zimmerman, left end on the
champion team of last year. Lang
don secured his release from the na
tional guard troops at American lake j
and returned early in the week,
while Zimmerman, after much per-1
suasion, deserted his farm near Al
mira and arrived in Pullman Tues
day night, donning his moleskins
Wednesday. "Zim" has dropped 10 j
pounds of avoirdupois during the |
! summer, but is hard as nails and in
! every way fitted for the fray. Lang-
I don also returns in the best of con
! dition, having done some strenuous
' practice work on the Mexican border.
! before the troops came home to
j Washington.
! Coach Dietz picked his "varsity"
j squad this week and is putting the
27 men named through strenuous j
I practice, while the remainder of the ;
i big squad was turned over to Assist
ant Coach Carl Dietz for further
drilling in the fundamentals of the'
: game.
5 "Bull" Durham and V. Brown
i were the coach's selections for
quarterback on the varsity squad.
Captain Bangs, C. Boone, R. Boone,
D. Briley, B. Doane, Fred Glover, R.
Hanley. and Skadan were named for
the other backfield positions. Lang
i don and Roy Bohler will perform at
1 center for the varsity and the guard
! positions were assigned to L. M. F_a
! kin. C. E. Eldredge, Jack Finny, W.
F. Hanson and Si Stites. At the ;
! tackle positions on the varsity squad |
will be found B. Brooks, R. Fish-;
! back, T. Goodyear, F. Hamilton, W. I
j Hen-eld, F. E. Kellogg and J. M.
I McGregor, while Zimmerman. L. R.
Hanley, R. Loomls and L. Leldl will
play the end positions.
In Wednesday's scrimmage Curley
Skadan, the Spokane candidate for
a backfield job. probably showed to
best advantage among the new men.
' The 200-pound Schnebly twins from
; Ellensburg did good work in the line
land Brown shone at quarterback.
Fred Glover will give the old men a
run for their money in the back
field, while McGregor is strong at
I the tackle position.
j, a team composed of second and
third team men will be taken to
Rosalia today to meet a team com
posed of Rosalia high school and ;

ischool and the students and forbid
ding the continuance of the present
j organizations and the organization
i of new ones except under the super-
I vision and control of the superin

I The resolution means the death of
| the Silver Circle, secret organization
'of high schol boys, which has held
' forth in the Ankeny building, and
• the Muchacho club, another organi
j zation of boys occupying quarters on
West Main street. One organization
i of the high school girls, the Artemis
club, also must cease to exist under
! the new edict.
The resolution comes as the direct
| result of investigations that dis
i closed the fact that the secret organi
! zations are damaging to the members
{and to their schol work. The in
vestigation was conducted following
] numerous complaints against the
boys* clubs, and the resolutions
! are sweeping in their scope. includ
ing not only the two clubs under ob
e servation but the girls' club as well.
Another club of boys, which was to
have been organized this week, ls
nipped In the bud by the action of
I the school board.
The resolutions adopted by the
j board were as follows:
"Inasmuch as secret organizations
serve no useful purpose for high
school boys and girls and It can be
shown that their effects on pupils of
| the high school age are often damag
»lng to them and to their work, and

further
Resolved, That all student or
ganizations shall be subject to the
supervision and general control of
the high school principal or superin- !
tendent."
Denounced by Fraternities
The high school clubs were also
the subject of a discussion by repre- ;
sentatives of the various college fra
ternities at a meeting Tuesday even
ing, when the fraternity men de
nounced the clubs as not being ex
ponents of the true Ideals of rater
nalism, hence derogatory to the fra- j
ternity movement.

suitable place in which the high I
school boys and girls may spend
their idle time to profit a concerted
movement for the organization of a j
well supervised Y. M. C. A. and a :
Y. W. C. A., for high school students
