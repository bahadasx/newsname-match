Balsams ir Dixville Notch, N. II.,
set out from the hotel Wednesday
afternoon and had walked on'v nine
miles before they lost their way. i
Since then they had been walkhnr j
aimlessly, They had spent two1
nights in the open before renchimr a
deserted lumber camp on the Dart-j
mouth College Grant .on .Dead Di-i- i
mond river, where they were found j
late Saturday night by Karl Gould j
and Scott Copp, employes of the I

food tho.y had was berries picked 1
from the hus-hr-; in the woods. Mrs. ;
Dennison was sulfering from pain-'
fully swollen feet, caused by tramp-j
ing over b)'i;-'i and stubble, 'hi all !
they had trampl 31 miles. ;
That the Donnisons were not. j
found sooner was due to a neries of j
coincidences. During their stay at !
the resort they had occasionally j
gone away en trips that t' ok one or j
two days, and their absence Wednes
day night arouxed no comment. ;
Their chauffeur had been given a

the hotel property and scores of ;
woodsmen were enlisted in the hunt.
The country hereabouts is one of j
the wildest in New England and !
once off the trail the situation for '

Good Class and a Thorough
Course Will He Taught.
. The State. Board of Education has
granted a teachers' training school
at Island Pond. The term opened
with a class of ten and is taught by
Miss Ruby Smith.
The school board desires to impress
the fact that this is not only a
thorough course fitting for teaching
but is a cultural course taking up
the fundamentals, including English
literature.physicology ami pedagogy.
This course is one that it is desirable
to study by those' who do not wish to
take up teaching, for the cultural
feature will prove of great benefit'
in all vocations.
There is prospect of a larger class
and if three more enter there will
be another teacher added. The
school is held in the Pleasant street
schoolhouse.
Not for many years has there
been as many students from outside
erirolled in the high school as at the
opening this year. Island Pond has
more than a good high school-- it' is
among the best and oilers gradu
ates some features not obtained in
many so-called good high-, schools.
One of these features is that gradu
ates can enter New England colleges
on the certificate of graduation and
without further examination. Island
Pond is taking the initiative in ad
vanced education .and its high school
is a leader.
