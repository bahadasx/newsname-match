. - -Regarding the ' rate of pay, which
prevailed before the strike, I am in

In which to earn 2: I regard this rate
of pay as being absurdly almost wick
edly Inadequate for the character of
labor performed by the stevedores. ; -Favors
Wage Increase
An increase of 60 per cent tn this

an unreasonahle'figure. There is prob
ably no class of labor In these islands
so severe ' as that . of stevedores and,
they should bo liberally paid. ' ' ,
'As regards the effort of the union

There is no sanctity and 6hould be no

secretary 'and treasurer of the local

"Referring ,to our recent letter to
you requesting your; good offices ; as
mayor In ,seek!ngito secure for us a
conference ,7 with 7 certain fkms l In
Honolulu employing stevedores, ; we
note with regret that you were unable
to have any of the firms discuss exist
ing difficulties. We -appreciate, how-ever-
your efforts in this behalf ami
hereby tender our sincere? thanks
therefor. We believe our claims for
an advance In wages to be absolutely
just and likewise believe the public
generally will recognlie them as fair.
"To begin .with, the work of a steve
dore Is not contlnuous.7 He may earn
$10 this week and little' or-nothing
next 'week. One of the facta always
dwelt upoa by the plantations when
claim la made 'that plantation labor
ers are underpaid. Is that they are at
work all the year round, which la not
true of agricultural, laborers on .the
mainland. While we are supposed
be always subject to call, yet we are
paid for only the hours when our em
ployers need us. ' ' : V '..,t, i.
"Again relerrrng to plantation T?
borers, attention has always been di
rected to the fact that they receive
house rent fuel, medical attention and
other things free. , We receive none
of these. - r" v n " ' J. VorV
- "The work of a stevedore Is nara,
and at times dangerous. It is cer
tainly more atrenuous tban that or
field , laborers or laborers on county
roads. -" "'
"It seems to us that our Compensa
tion Is pitifully smalL We receive 20
cents per hour.'. For: all over eight
hours we are paid at the rate . of 40
cents per ' hour . Certilnly ; neither
rate is enough for the hard work done
.: it t 1ms -than half . of that
received for similar work on the main
land, and less than that paid ior.any
other labor of equal requirements in
HawalL' -7 , .. " : " 7-
! "If times were hard with our em
ployers: If dividends had to be passed,
and expenses curtailed, perhaps It
might be said that our claims were
unjust But the contrary Is true. The
firm of McCabe, .Hamilton & Renny
with a' capitalization of. $50,000, de-4
pends for its earnings solely on steve
doring, and whatever sums it is able
to - pay Its stockholders come solely
from the fruits of our labori Just
what-that firm Is paying now In the
way of dividends we cannot exactly
say, but believe that it aggregated
last year not less than 30 per cent
Surely It is not presumptuous, nor-ex-travagant
for us tc ask that part of
this sum be paid. us, who really earn
it - for the company.- We have, of
course, no way of telling what other
concerns save for their stockholders
by the meager wages paid .us, but
