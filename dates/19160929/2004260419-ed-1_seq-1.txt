QUARRY INSTALLS
NEW MACH1NH.K i
The St. Helens Quarry has In
stalled a now conveyor for the lond
lug of screenings. This convoyor
does away with the slow method for
merly used of loading tho barges by
hand work. The convoyor takes the
screenings to tho barge and with a
constant stream of tho rock pourod
on tho bnrgo by tho convoyor it
makes tho loading of tho barge much
more rapid than under the system
formerly used. Supt. Avory Is res
ponsible for tho Insinuation of this
dovlce nnd statos It Is giving ported
satlsfactlon and facilitates the work ,0rs prenont nnd also those who de
to a groat extont. Lire to join the Alliance.

was recently notified that she had
been awarded the state prize in the
hygienic essay contest, conducted by
tlio state W. C. T. U: In the schools
of Oregon.
Last April nearly all the high
schools of the state sent essays, dls
ussing some aspect of the prohibi
tion question, to the Portland office
of Mrs. G. L. Buland, superintendent
cf temperance instruction.
The honor conferred upon Miss
Hattan is no small one, since Mrs.
Bulnnd states in her congratulatory
tottor that the essays in 1916 were
of a higher order of excellonce, both
In scientific research and compost
lion, than those in former years.
Tho first prize of $25 and a loving
cup will be presented to Miss Hattan
at the state convention of the W. C,

GOES ON VACATION
TO BRITISH COLUMBIA
Judge John Philip left Sunday
morning for a two weeks visit with
his son Alex, at Alta Lake, British
Columbia, which Is about 80 mile
from Vancouver and is one of the
highest points on the famous old
"Caribou" trail. Wild game Is plenti
ful in this region, and the judgo
stated that ho expected to bag sev
Tiral bear and deer, and If the cus
tom authorities would permit It,
would remember his St. Helen
friends. Judge Philip's son Is
charge of a hotel there, so it Is quite
probable that he will have "all the
comforts of home" while rusticating
In the mountains of British Col urn
bla.
Tho county court has had the loose
racks removed from tho road at the
DeSpain hill. It Is an Improvement
which Is much appreciated by the
traveling public.

ROAD EXPENDITURES
FOR MONTH OF AUGUST
N FIGURES $38,217.19
Statement of tlie Outlay of Funds
and on What Account.
According to the published report
the county court's proceedings.
hlch were given In last week's MiBt,
Coll
umbia county opent a considerable
amount of money during the month
August. The road funds, of course.
came In for the heaviest draft on the
public funds, as the following will
show. The amount given included
both labor and supplies, but does not
include the cost of surveying, super
visor's salaries and many other Items
which are paid by the general fund.
According to the amount expended,
Columbia county must be making
good progress In road building.
Road DIst. No. 1 1 4.311.39
Road Dist. No. 2 6,650.46
Road Dist. No. 3 4,184.44
Road Dist. No. 4 K nio oi
Road Dist. No. 5 5!oi3!8
Road Dist. No. 6 3,639.33
Road Dist. No. 7 4.011.10
Total $32,828.91
Figuring 26 working days oer
month, we can see that we are spend
ing at the rate of $1,200 per day on
the roads. In addition to the above
amount, $703.75 was paid from the ,
general fund and $370.31 was spent
out of the special fund of District
No. 7, which brings the total road
expenditure for August to $34,000,
round figures. The amount charged
gainst the general fund aggregated
4,300. Of this amount $1,674.15
cherged to roads and highways
and .Included-surveying,' road super--"
visors' salaries, etc. It cost the coun
ty $890.09 to look after the care of
the poor. The amount shown as
expended in the general fund does
not Inctude the salaries of the coun
ty officials, which, exclusive of the
county judge, tho commissioners and
the school superintendent, amounted
to $1,128.99. The salary of a county
commissioner is $5 per day and his
expenses. Commissioner Weed drew
from the county coffers the tidy sum
of $71, and Harvey not to be out
done by his colleague, took $111.44
of the county's "kale." The amount
paid the road supervisors is as fol
lows:
D. McKay, Dist. 1 S 98.00
Elon Felton, Dist. 2 108.60
B. J. Keelan, Dist. 3 84.00
R. N. Lovelace, Dist. 4 91.00
F. A. Burnham, Dist. 5 89.25
E. T. Wallace, Dist. 6 43.76
B. Mills, Dist. 7 94.50
Total salaries ....$601.00
A few more interesting items can
be gleaned by a careful perusal of
tlie" county's statement. For instance,
under surveying, we find we have
spent $288.67, which bills are ap
proved by the county survoyor, and
in Mr. Farnsworth's department the
expense runs up to $371.15. The
total surveying expenso for August,
therefore, totals $659.72.
Another interesting Item is the
auto hlro and supplies, and by total
ing tho various amounts allowed by
the court, we see that the "Joy wa
gons" cost tho county $147.28 dur
ing the month. Totaling the entire
expense, it will look about like the
following:
Spent on roads $32,828.91
General fund exponses... . 4,259.29
salaries, etc. 1,128.99
Expensos for August . .$38,217.19
And to this If we wore to add the
depreciation on tools, crushers, etc.,
tho expenso for the month will come
very close to the $40,000 mark.
Later on tho Mist will make a com
parative statement for the past five
years, and see how much more we
are spending each month.
OPEN SEASON
. FOR PHEASANTS
The open season for Chinese
pheasants begins Sunday, and the
woods and Holds will be full of hunt
ers before sunup. Tho bag limit for
one day Is five, and as deputy war
dens will be quite numerous it will
be well for hunters to observe the
law. Birds loft at this office will be
duly acknowledged.
