ITER QUESTION
strike flowing wen at depth
ot 1 IU tect near pre
sent Water Works
Plant.
WILL DRIVE 10 INCH PIPE
Vein of water conies from strata of
gravel ten feet deep. Supplv is
unlimited.
The question of an adequate wati t
supply for Paw Paw has been a seri
ous problem, not only for the village
council but for the residents of the
village. It was early in the morning
during the extreme hot and dry
weather that the supply at the wells
began to diminish. It was impossible
to get enough to supply the requisite
amount for domestic and lawn use.
Drastic measures were taken and the
use of water for lawns ami gardens
absolutely prohibited. Since that
time the council have been wrestling
with the matter in an effort to solve
the problem.
The Riedel Springs were investi
gated; Mud Lake supply was taken
into consideration, and various wells
driven. Not until last week were any
definete results obtained, and now if
all signs do not fail as they do some
times "during a dry spell" the water
problem for Paw Paw is about solved.
Charles Morley of Lawton has been
driving "test" wells. One near the
basket factory brought no results.
Another near the present water works
driven to a depth of nearly two hun- j
dred and fifty feet was also a failure.
A second well at the plant, driven
within two feet of the first one and
to a depth of one hundred and ten feet
has produced a genuine "Flowing
Well". This well with an inch and a
quarter pipe, is now flowing about
twelve gallons per minute. The vein
is in a strata of course gravel about
fifteen feet in depth and ll apparently
unlimited. A ten inch pipe will be
put in, which is thought will furnish
in abundance. A sample of the water
has been sent to the State Board of :
Health for analysis, and if found to be'
I
pure, the water supply question for,
Paw Paw will undoubtedly have been
solved
LEG BROKEN
T
Frank Hodges meets with
aecident which wil! lay
him up for several
months.
ft V. HodgM met with a serious
accident last Monday night which will
probably confine him to the bed for
months. He Wai driving his motor
cycle near Niles. Clark McGrady
was with him, occuping the side seat
of the machine. It was after dark,
and probably about seven o'clock.
They were near the little station of
Summerville, when they noticed a car
coming toward them. They turned
out, but the driver of the car claims
that he did not see the light of the
motorcycle until he was upon them.
The result of course was a collision
In the mix up one of Frank's legs was
badly lacerated and both bones brok
en below the knee. He was carried
to a nearby farm house and a surgeon
summoned from Dowagiac, and later
one from Niles. The broken bones
were set, and the unfortunate man
made as comfortable as possible. He
was brought to his home here, Tues
day noon. Much sympathy is tXpfeei
ed fer 1 rank, who certainly has had
more than his share of hard luck and
misfortune during the past two or
three years.

This is the splendid ticket that was
nominated in the republican state
convention at Saginaw yesterday.
Never in the history of the state has
there been as large an attendance, or
more enthusiasm shown by any party
in convention-assembled than was
seen yesterday at Saginaw. The re
publican forces were present from
every nook and corner of the state,
and if any of the regular delegates
were unable to be there, some substi
tute was on hand to fill- the vacancy.
John Mangum of Marquette, chair
man of the State Central committee
called the convention to order, and
right here let it be said that Mr.
Mangum is a real live chairman. If
the republican party in Michigan this
year does not roll up the greatest
majority in its history, it will not be
John Mangum's fault. The veteran
Denny Alwanl read the call. Hon.
Albert E. Ivtermann of Houghton
county was called to the chair as tem
porary chairman. Mr. Petermann is
one of the really "big" men in Mich
igan, and never in the history of the
republican party has a better speech
been made by a Michigan man. He
hit straight from the shoulder, and
drove his points home with broadside
after broadside. He was frequently
interrupted with applause. Every
one in the immense building seemed
happy and it was indeed a memorable
gathering of representative republic
ans. Committees were appointed and ad
journment taken for the noon hour.
After the various reports had been
adopted the convention settled down
to the various contests which resulted
as indicated at the head of this story.
The secretary of state and treasurer
were both nominated by acclamation.
It was a second term for Mr. Vaughan
to which he was entitled without
opposition.
A bitter light had been anticipated
in the contest for treasurer, but De
puty Treasurer (iorman withdrew
from the race, leaving the field open
to Senator Samuel O'Dell from Shelbv
Time and space will not permit a
story of the balloting in detail, but
the result has been stated. It nil
a great convention, some of the con
gests were spirited, but all was har
, mony, and the splendid republican
j ticket now before the people of Mich
igan will without doubt be elected
from top to bottom with an over
whelming majority.
Governor Willis of Ohio addressed
the convention at; some length and
his talk was one of the most stirring,
logical and impressive ever listened
to in a state convention.
GRAPE HARVEST IS NOW ON
The harvest of Concord Grapes is
now nearly at its heigh ih. The sea-
i son will be short this year as the
crop is much smaller than had been
pi dieted before the harvest actually
began. There will probably be not
to exceed thirty per cent of a full crop
in the belt. The price will be good
and probably will not fall much below
eighteen cents per basket during the
season. Some shipments have brought
a little more than eighteen cents.
MRNEYS RESUME THEIR WORK
A letter from Charles K. Varney,
states that the family are now located
at 4011 Chestnut street, Philadelphia.
This will be their headquarters while
in the Fast. Mr. and Mrs. Varney
have renewed their "Lyceum and
Welfare" work after enjoying their
summer vacation here in Taw Paw.
Charles Jr. is continuing his college
work in the University of Pennsyl
vania. RELICS OF DAYS
THAT ARE GONE
Ballot that was voted on
the Field during Days of
the War. Another in
1880
The Hartford Day Spring of last
week gives an interesting account of
a Souvenir of the Garfield campaign,
now in the possesion of Attorney C.
M. Van Riper of that city. It is re
publican ballot of 1880 and is prized
by the Hartford attorney on account
of the fact that his father the late
Judge Jacob J. Van Riper was the
candidate on that ticket for attorney
General of Michigan. Justice 0. W.
Rowland of Paw Paw was a candidate
for Prosecuting Attorney on that tick
et, and in commenting on the notable
career of the veteran O. W., the Day
Spring offers the following
"It is noted that Justice O. W.
Rowland of Paw Paw, the veteran
attache of the court house who has
become a walking encyclopedia of
court house affairs and an authority
on county history, was then a candid
ate for prosecuting attorney. Mr.
Rowland's name has appeared on a
majority of the republican county
tickets from that time to the present,
for the past several years as one of
the candidates for circuit court com
missioner, and as the "grand old man"
of the county seat he bids fair to re
ceive the favors of his party as long
ai he will accept them."
The subject of the above paragraph
has presented to the writer a republic
an ballot that was actually voted in
the year 1864, It is a Lincoln and
Johnson ballot, and was voted by
Some member Of the Third Michigan
Cavalry on the Field at Brownsville,
Arkansas. Among the familiar
names on the ticket are the following:
For Representative, Jonathan J.
Woodman; For Sheriff, Noble D. Rich
ardson; Judge of Probate, Chandler
Richards on a split ticket, Theodore
W. Hendricks being the party nom
inee; County Clerk, Ashbel H. Her
ron; Register of Deeds, Stephen W.
Duncombe; County Treasurer, Samuel
H. Blackman; Prosecuting Attorney,
Hiram Cole; County Surveyor, Chas.
J. Monroe.
IDLE HOUR DRAWING
LARGE CROWDS NIGHTLY
At the Idle Hour theatre on Mon
day, Tuesday and Wednesday of this
week, the Bonehead Ministrel, con
sisting of LaMore and Rozelle, held a
lively session each night. They were
a good, clean team and their songs,
dances and combintion acts were far
above the average-in fact they were
exceedingly good and repetition of
this class of work would be gladly
welcomed by Paw Paw theatre goer.-.
Manager Decker is to be compli
mented and should be given much
credit for the class of pictures he now
has at the Idle Hour. Besides having
an excelent progran each night, on
Wednesday he shows the famous
Mutual Masterpietures and on Fri
day nrghts the very latest and highest
priced pictures obtainable-the Blue
bird features. These two films need
no comment-their names alone are
sivrnifieient of quality as all picture
fans well know.
The Idle Hour is greeted nightly by
crowds eager to see the latest pro
ductions of the film world which they
an- am to encounter at this popular
playhouse. Now that the paving is
noaring completion, the old time
crowds are in evidence nightly. Get
the habit now and attend the Idle
Hour every night.
PRESS ASSOCIATION 10 MEET
Plans are being made for the Fall
meeting of the Van Buren County
Press Association at Lawton on Fri
day October 13th. The time will be
devoted largely to business of the
association, with a possibility of a
short auto ride to some of the vine
yards in that vicinity. C. E. Lewis,
editor of the Lawton Leader is presi
dent of the county association.
Lyle Barnhart now a marks
man in the United States
Marine.
Lyle Barnhart of this county has
qualified as a marksman in the
United States Marine Corps, accord
ing to an official bulletin issued by
the Washington headquarters,
I. vie, who is a son of John Barn
hart of Lacota, enlisted in the United
States Marine Corps at its Toledo,
Ohio recruiting station on May 15th,
1916, is now serving at Haiti, with
the Marines who recently suppressed
the rebellion in that historical little
isle. Marines are Uncle Sam's guard
ians of the seas, and frequently land
in hostile countries to settle factional
disputes and restore the stability of
government. Recent reports from
Haiti show that the period of recon
struction is well on the way, and that
young Barnhart and his "comrades-in
arms" have bore their share in this
history-making epoch.
Although Barnhart has had but
little experience at target practice,
his marked ability with a rifle is con
sidered by Marine Corps official 1 as
very promising.
ED BETWEEN CARS
Jess Labadie has narrow
escape last Friday even
ing. Badly Bruised.
Jess Labadie had a mighty close
call and is still confined to the bed as
a result of an accident at Lawton last
Friday evening. Jess is conductor on
the Fruit Belt line. He was on the
last "run" for the day and was bring
ing in the train which arrives here at
seven o'clock in the evening from
Kalamazoo. This train handles
freight as well as passenger business,
and Jess was on the side of a freight
ear at Lawton, switching some empty
Can on the siding at that station.
The Michigan Central had also left
some empty freight cars on the siding
and quite close to the Fruit Belt line.
It was after dark and raining a little
so that Jess could not see the cars on
the M. C. track until he was close to
them, and too late to jump. The re
sult was he was caught between the
two cars and badly squeezed. He
was brought at once to his home here
and given prompt medical attention.
No bones were broken but he was
badly bruised about the chest and
shoulders and it will probably be sever
al days yet before he is able to leave
his bed.

VAN BUREN BOY
HAS QUALIFIED

INTERESTING ADDRESS THE
COUNTY BAR
Delivered by O. W. Rowland at a Recent Meeting of
the Van Buren County Bar Association
COUNTY CLERK '68-72
It was my good fortune at the
November election 1868, to be elect
ed by the voters of Van Buren county
t the responsible position of county
clerk, which office I continued to hold
for a period of four years, and I
have been deputy clerk for every one
of my successors, making a period of
nearly half a century in which I
have been connected in that and other
capacities with the business of the
circuit court of the county, and con
sequently, I have become somewhat
familiar with the legal business and
affair of the county.
I do not think that at the time of
my election I had been in our circuit
court half a dozen times in my life. I
was absolutely ignorant of all matters
relating to legal proceedings. I had,
it is true, a year or so previously,
been elected to the honorable office of
justice of the peace in the township
of Lawrence, where I then resided, but
I very soon realized that an election
to a judicial office conferred no legal
knowledge or ability upon the person
so chosen. People sometimes seem
to think that as soon as one is elected
I to the office of justice, he is fully
i m:il ified to irivp full and accurate ad
vice upon any matter of law in which
they may be interested or may desire
information.
Van Buren Count v Court House at Paw Paw.
JUSTICE OF Till PEACE.
As an illustration of how little I
knew, at that time of legal matt i s,
let me relate the following experience.
A suit was brought before me where
in a school district was plaintiff. On
the trial, it was claimed by the attor
ney for the defense, whose name I
will not mention, that the assessor
of the district, by whom the suit was
brought, was not legally elected and
that, therefore, the suit could not be
maintained.
The attorney wax a particular
friend of mine and 1 placed full con
fidence in what he said, feeling that
he would not lead me astray, and so
I usurped the function of the circuit
judge and virtually ousted the assess
or f rom the office in which he was act
ing. Of course the attorney knew
that the question of his election
could not be rightfully Involved in the
ease, but I did not know any better.
The case was appealed to the cir
cuit court and was then pending
when I was elected as clerk. I soon
began to learn some things in regard
to the authority of courts of inferior
jurisdiction and you, Gentlemen of the
Bar, can imagine something of my
1 f clings, when I found that appeal
Cast pending, fearing it would be call
jsd for trial and that my ignorance
would thereby be exposed. Fortunate
ly for me, the appellant did not pay
'the entry fee and the case was never
placed on the calendar for hearing.
Mr. Ashbel H. Herron, my imme
diate predecessor, who was a very
efficient official, soon taught DM the
rudiments of the intricate and import
ant duties pertaining to the office and
in the due course of time I became
fairly familiar with them.
JI DGK LITTLEJOHN.
Hon. Flavius J. Littlejohn of
Allegan was then on the bench and
was very patient with and kind to his
new clerk. Our judicial circuit, at
OF BYGONE DAYS
that time consisted of Allegan, Kala
mazoo and Van Buren counties.
Judge Littlejohn was a learned
'gentleman of the old school. In
J private life he was socqpble and
I genial, but when holding court he was
jthe very personification of dignity.
I I can imagine that I hear him, after
jthe the lapse of these many years,
saying to me, the first thing after the
,sheriff had announced that court was
jin session, "Mr. Clerk, read the jour
nal." Nothing could be done, no
business could be transacted until the
I
record of the previous day had been
read, corrected if necessary, and sign
ed by His Honor. It is with pleasure
j that I recall his unfailing kindness
i and courtesy. No more able, just and
upright judge ever presided over our
circuit court.
LAW EES OF '68 TO '72
During the four years that I officia
ted as clerk, the following named
gentlemen were members of the Van
Buren County Bar. Those marked
