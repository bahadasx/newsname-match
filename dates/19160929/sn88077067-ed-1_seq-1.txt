Arrangement were completed by
Chairman Carlin of the Democratic
Executive Committee, while at Co
luiiilniH this week, for the opening of
the local campaign on Monday, Octo
ber 9.
The first Democratic gun of the
Mercer county campaign will be fixed
by Ex-Governor Jim Cox, again demo
cratlc nominee for Governor this
year; Hon. A. "Put" Sandles, of Otta
wa; Hon. Benjamin Meyer, prominent
Cincinnati German; Hon n. F. Widty,
Democratic nominee for Congress in,
the Fourth district and several other
diHtrict Htumpers.
The opening will consist of an all
day tour of the county and Governor
Cox or Put Sandles will speak In ev
ery town In the county during the
day. Doth gentlemen will speak from
the same platform probably at Chick
asaw, Ft. Recovery, Chattanooga and
this city. The tour will begin at 10
a. m., and wind-up with a big rally in
this clty,and addresses In the opera
nouse in me evening.
The route of the proposed tour and
the hours at which the speakers will
be In the different parts of the coun
ty will be published in the county pa
pers next week. It Is probable that
the party will be accompanied by all
of the Democratic district and county
candidates.
Hon. Atlee Pomerene, United
States Senator from Ohio, and Demo
cratic nominee for re-election will be
in the county on Friday, Oct. 13, and
in all prabablllty will speak either at
Ft. Recovery .Coldwater or St. Hen
ry Definite announcement will also
be made of this next week.
Congressman John Hefel, of Geor
gia, one of the most noted humorists
in Congress will address the voters of
Minster and vicinity on Monday even
ing, October 5. Quite a number of
Democrats from Marion township will
likely attend the meeting.
State Auditor Vic Donahey, Demo
cratic nominee for re-election will be
In the county the week of October 16
and will probably speak In this city
and Coldwater. Several other prom
inent speakers are promised for
meetings at Rockford, Mendon and
Neptune, while a couple of good Ger
man speakers will tour the south end
of the county the week of October 23.
While the laboring people and em
ployers of the State are alive to the
imminent danger to their laws they
must give thought to the judicial
branch of State government. In Ohio,
Judges James G. Johnson and M. H.
Donahue, who are now rounding out
their first terms In the Supreme
Court, are candidates for re-election
on separate non-partisan Judicial tic
kets. They represent the forward
looking kind of Judges and during
their term of office Ohio has been giv
en a Supreme Court that is recognis
ed as Impartial, fair and honest.
They are opposed for re-election In
one instance by a man who was turn
ed out of the Supreme Court six years
ago because of his reactionary record,
and who since has been engaged In
propaganda against laws passed for
the benefit of the common people.
The other opponent is a man who
ranks low as a lawyer and who has
not a single personal attribute to
make him worthy of the place he
seeks. Those who want justice In
Ohio and an efficient administration
of the Courts must reelect James G.
Johnson and M. H. Donahue. To se
cure their re-election It Is necessary
to have these names fixed firmly In
mind so that ,the X mark can be
placed in front of them on the ballot
In which the order of names is chang
ed on each succeeding ballot.
Messrs Fullington and McGiffert in
control of the Willis State Tax Com
mission! The old Guilbert-McKinnon
crowd! "The good old days."
A communication published editor
ially in the Cincinnati Post takes this
view of the; Maine election: The
Democratic vote this year was an In
crease of 15,434 over the Democratic
vote four years ago for President
Wilson. The Republican vote in
Maine this year was only 5319 more
than that for Taft and Roosevelt four
years ago.
In a canned editorial for Myron T.
Herrick this introductory sentence
was used. "Myron T .Herrlck's splen
did records as Governor of Ohio." Let
us see.. Two years of that splendid
record "caused Warren G. Harding,
now Senator ,to refuse to run on the
same ticket with Mr. Herrick, and
turned a favorable Republican major
ity of 113,812 Into an adverse major
ity of 42,647. Perhaps it would be
well If the Herrick supporters did not
spend too much time talking about
his splendid gubernatorial record.
His wobbling, carrying-water on both
shoulders attitude then gained him
the name of "The great what is It."
He Is no different today but he has
more money to spend to get an office.
WHERE IS WILLIS ?
In November California, Montana,
Michigan, Nebraska, South Dakota,
Idaho and Missouri will vote on pro
hibition. If Willis was running for
Governor In all seven states ne would
want the wets to think he was with
them and the same with the drys.
Sunday booze in Cincinnati, prize
fights on Lake Erie, and saintly
speeches In dry territory Is the Willis
policy. Ottawa Sentinel.
Letters of citizenship were granted
Henry Senebogen, of this city, and

MCST JUSTIFY WILLIS
To justify the stand of Governor
Willis in his permission of the knock
out prize fight at Cedar Point on La
bor Day, his subservient picture
censor board has endorsed the exhib
ition of films of the fight in the pic
ture houses before the women and
children of Ohio. Notwithstanding
the contention of the Governor's
henchmen who say the venal show is
a boxing match" the fact remains
that it went to a knock-out for the
championship, and that the end was
an exhibition of absolute brutality.
The fight was staged over the protest
of hundreds of ministerial associa
tions and welfare workers of the
state.
This is the first time since the or
ganization of the Ohio Board of Cen
sorship that a prize fight film has
been permitted to be shown. It was
passed in the absence of Mrs. Maud
Murray Miller who has heretofore re
sisted the Governor's dictation in in
jecting politics into the work. Mrs.
Miller is too ill to attend to her du
ties, and had been In a Columbus
Hospital for more than a week.

THE WILLIS WAY
In his address before the State Bankers'
convention and at other places, the Gov

reductions in the cost of keeping up the
Bank Inspection department. The recent
smash of Cincinnati bank revealed thin
It had not been examined for eighteen
months which gave the wreckers an un
deserved opportunity of looting it. Now
comes the State Banking Superintendent,
Harry Hall, In his annual report, just Is
sued, to recommed the appointment of
more bank examinees. The department Is
tieing deliberately starved to make a
showing of economy because the Governor
In his address points to the surplus of
$50,000 "earned" by the department and
turned into the treasury. He's like the
man who put green goggles on his horse
and fed it with shavings. The horse died,
of course, but the man saved money while
It was starving.

SAVINGS ACCOUNTS
Ohio Btuto Journal
Kvery man who earna wages as well aa
every man who works for hlmielf or earna
prollts should have a savings account.
Many will hoot at thla idea, declaring
their Income hardly pays for their bread
and butter now. They don't seem to un
deist and it will pay more easily If they
save a little every day. It may not be ov
er a nickel, but It is something; and It la
not ao much the accumulation that counts
as It Is the aspiration.
We hear about the pauper labor in Eu
rope, but It la all In the imagination, if
we take the assertion of J. L. Davis, vice
president of the St. ixiuis Union Trust
Compajiy, as authority. lie auld In a
speech there last Wednesday as follows:
It is significant that In the United
States, where the wages are notoriously
high, only 99 people of each 1000 have sav
ings accounts, w liereus in Australia there
arc JU0; in Kngland, 302; III Germany,
:il7 :ln France, M6; In Belgium, 397, In
Swlt.erlitnd, 554.
If they can show such signs of thrift In
the countries of Europe, where Boinucn
pauper labor Is said to exist, the people
of this nation ought to do a great deal
better. Our savings accounts don't aver
age loo in 10IMI population, while In all the
foreign counties they evcrage over 300 to
the 1 1 ii II) people. There Is something the
matter with us. Thrift is a virtue that
all Intelligent and well-meaning people
should exemplify. The habit makes true
citizens of us, better fathers and mothers,
and better communities. Start today,
dear reader, with a savings account, even
if it is only a nickel a day that you can
put Into it. A savings account not only
does the depositor good, but everybody
else. There Is a sort of selfishness In not
having one.
CHARLES UNDERSTANDS THE
SITUATION
Here Is a statement by Charles Spang
ler, traveling out of Toledo, for the Ar-huckle-Ryitn
Company, selling farm ma
chinery and Implements, marie publicly In
Wapakoneta .that is indicative of the pub
lic mind:
"Gentlemen, do we want Wilson and
peace, or de we want Hughes and war?
I am a German and I am proud of it, and
prouder still of the fact that Capt. Koenig
of the Dc iitschlaud is now In Germany,
making speeches on the kindness he re
ceived at the hands of t'nele Sam. An
other thing 1 am proud of and that is the
fact that I am a esident of this glorious
country and that we now have a Presi
dent who has done things and, while I
think lots of Germany, liecause my par
ets came from that country, I do not want
to go back: neither do you. Then ano
ther thing I want to impress upon you
fellows Is the Workmen's Compensation
Act. You had to wait until Cox looken
after your interests before you ever got
anything, didn't you? Now. gentlemen. I
have traveled some in the last two
months and if popular sentiment Is a cri
terion us to the result of the election this
fall, Wilson and Cox will have an easy
walkaway. Those few Germans who have
tieen critizing Wilson should read the
German papers and get in right on the
finest ion before they do something they
will be sorry for."

Walnut Chapel C. E. Society spent
a very pleasant evening last Sunday
with Field-Secretary, Arch D. Cor
dier of Celina, who gave a very in
teresting talk which was greatly en
joyed by all present. He gave many
helpful suggestions pertaining to the
Christian Endeavor work which was
very much appreciated. Spring Val
ley C. E. Society also spent the even
ing with the Society. The Misses
Belle Piatt and Bessie Snider favor
ed the Society with a duet, and spe
cial music was furnished by the So
ciety's choir.
The U. B. Endeavorers of Montezu
ma held a very good meeting last
Sunday evening with Miss Lura
Frank, leader. About two-thirds of
those present took an active part In
the meeting. Miss Electra Balllnger
favored the Society with a very pleas
ing piano solo.
The Celina Endeavorers witnessed
a splendid meeting Sunday evening.
It being the regular monthly mission
ary meeting ,the leader Mrs. Frances
Rutherford, chairman of the mission
ary committee planned the meeting.
She chose China for the subject whicn
was very well discussed in three min
ute talks and papers. The hour was
too short for all to take part, conse
quently there were many interesting
subjects of China upon which nothing
was said. The Missionary committee
is doing good work, as it has planned
to take up the study of some country
at each missionary meeting. It Is al
so planning on a mission stuay class
In the near future.
TO AID IN RE-ELECTION OF PRES
DDENT WPLSON
The Wilson Business Men's League
of Ohio, a non-partisan organization
has been organized to aid the re-election
of President Wilson. W. A. Ju
lian, Shoe manufacturer of Cincinna
ti, is president. The other members
of the executive committee are F. E.
Myers, Pump manufacturer, Ashland;
Russ J. Christy, manufacturer, Fre
mont; Walter T .Johnson, manufac
turer, Kenton; O. N. Samsbarker, of
Hillsboro; V S. Thomas, farm mach
inery manufacturer, Springfield; F.
A. Stacey, banker and iron manufac
turer, Chillicothe; James Kilbourne,
manufacturer .Columbus ,and M. M.
Renick, paper bag manufacturer, of
Middletown.
In a statement President Julian
says:
"We are in the boat with such
forward looking men as Thomas A.
Edison and Henry Ford, and we do
not want to return to power the
mossbacks of this country. The
election of Hughea will hamstring
tha business of tu.' country. Wood
row Wilson has done as much for
emancipation of business as Lin
coln did to emancipate the slaves."
These business men see in the elec
tion 'of Ungues the certain destruct
ion of the Federal Reserve Act with
the passage of laws requiring compul
sory arbitration nnd compulsory mili
tary enlistment. The forecast Is that
Hughes would have Ellhu Root as
Secretary of State, and Theodore Roo
sevelt as Secretary of War, which
would deliver the country to the In
terests which would rule and would
mean a desti uction of peace and busi
ness prosperity.
