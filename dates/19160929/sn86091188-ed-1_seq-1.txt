COLLECT FOR CLUB WOMEN
"Keep us, O God, from pettiness; let
us be large in thought, in word, in
deed.
Let us be done with iaull-hnding.
and leave off self-seeking.
May we put away all pretence and
meet each other face to face without
self-pity and without prejudice.
May we never be hasty in judgment
and always generous.
Teach us to put into action our bet
ter impulses, straighttorward and un
afraid.
Let us take time for all things: make
us grow calm, serene, gentle.
Grant that we may realize it is the
little things that create differences;
that in the big things of life we are
as one.
And may we strive to touch and to
know the great common heart of us all,
and, O Lord God, let us not forget to
be kind

A CASE WHERE OFFICE
IS SEEKING THE MAN
-
Joint T Watkins candidacy for ti e
state senate from Lemhi county Is
surely an instance of the odice seek
lng the man. He tagged to tie spar
the business losses of au
mpaigu.
and tie dreaded the responsibility and
trying duties of the office which
means bo much to the county and tlie
st ate. When one friend was restrained
from advancing his candidacy lief re
the date of tiling for the prlrovry
election by hi« pleadings and pro
tests, another friend would coûte up
with stronger plea for just such s*-rv
ice us lie would give to the public at
this time of need for representation
in the Interest of the common people.
It was not difficult to And profes
Islonal men and rich men who desired
this position of great honor, small
pay and opportunities for class favor
Itism.hut it was a diffarent undertak
lng to Und a man of anility, moral
character and practical knowledge of
the needs of ttie commun people of
the county. Mr. Watkins has bad op
portunity and natural and acquired
ability to study the needs of every
community of Lemhi county for 16
years. His sympathies are with the
common people He has observed
ttie legislative outrages of : lie past
lb years a id lie has posit! e remedies
for many of the evils which have
crept into our statutes
EVERYBODY TALKING
OF BLACKBIRD COBALT
The sale of the great cobalt dépo -
rt of Blackbird to the association
which controls the world output of
this metal is the most important
transaction that has been con
sumated in Lemhi county in the hi«.
to* y the country Tills is said to he
the only known suoplv in the United
States tiiai can fie depended on to
meet the growing demand for this
important metal All the foreign
mines are being exhausted just as the
demind fur the metal is increasing <i
hundred fold every year
The Blackbird deposit is the great
est in extent and importance tint
was ever discovered. There are said
to be millions of tons of workable ore,
and the value of the metal has ad
vancedto a price that will justify
extensive operations even under
the disadvantages of transportation
which prevail. The present market
will permit the extensive operation
of these mines at great prohr und«
present conditions. The purchasing
capitalists, however, are strung
enough to build railroads to the
property and the magnitude of the
proposition will justify the ex pen 11
ture of mi'lllons of dollars. The co
balt, nickel, copper and g Id of the
Blackbird district assure the build
ing of a great mining city in some
part of that region over the hill from
Salmon.
J. w. Ctples first interested El
wood Haynes of autjmutnie fame m
the possibilities of Blackbird cobrll
and has finally induced him to take
wiiat amounts to an opti.jn in the
properties Mr. Caples is now ma*

BRADY MACHINE'S
POLITICAL HOLD
J
iioi.se, September 2b.—The iwio
campaign In Idaho may now lie «aid
to lie opened. The essential s ep of
the forma! opening of the campaign
was the selection of the elate chair
man by the two political organiza
tions which was effected In this city
last week In both parties there was
a contest on over the selection of tlie
head of the organization, but in the
republican ranks the contest, «s is |

Boise, C W. Suppinger of Moscow
and L. M Capps of Black foot vice
chair man to represent t,he various
sections ot the state. Fred Floed of
Boise » as «sleeted to head tlie pub
licity bureau.
The republican committee selected
Evan Evan» as chairman and select
ed VV. C. Gregory, caviller of tlie
First National bank at American
Falls, as secretary and C. E. Elmer
was selected to head the publicity
bureau.
The Brady machine fastened It«
complete control on ti e republican
party in.this state upon its »in-cete
lui demand for Gregory as secretary
of the committee. Gregory lia» t»ee»i
Senator Brady » confidential man hie
