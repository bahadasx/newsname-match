GOOD CROPS AT GLENTANA
There are some wonder crops in the
Northland this year, despite the hail
in some sections and the red rust in
others, says the Glentana Reporter,
East of here Bill Jarvis is threshing
his crop on his big ranch and it is
running far beyond his expectations. I
Reports yesterday were to the effect (
that his wheat is running better than j
thirty-five bushels to the acre, and thej
quality is splendid. He has 500 acres
of wheat, all macaroni. He expects
about fifteen thousand bushels
wheat this year, and his six hundred
acres of oats will make about twelve
bushels to the acre.
Jim McKinnon's wheat, as far as
he has gone is making a little better
than eighteen and a half bushels to
the acre. The quality is fine. He
has eighty acres of wheat yet to
thresh and a hundred acres of splen
Engineer Meets Horrible
Death in Engine Gears
John Kelly, engineer on the An
thony Bloom threshing rig, near Wil
liston, was killed Saturday afternoon
two miles south of McGregor, in one
of the most frightful accidents record
ed in many years.
Kelly was on top of the engine as
the crew was preparing to move and
his right foot slipped and was caught
between the cogs and main body of
the engine and the right leg was
drawn into the wheel nearly to the
hip.
The leg was crushed and mangled
and the muscles and ligaments torn
loose on the right side of thé body
clear to the shoulder. The abdomen
was torn open and the largest body
muscles were ripped asunder.
After the machine was stopped
Kelly was held in the machinery for
more than half an hour while the
did flax. His oats went thirty-eight
bushels to the acre.
Bill Neihoff has threshed part of
his large crop and the yield is very
gratifying, considering the setbacks.
It is running at twenty-two bushels
to the acre. His oats is also making
a satisfactory yield.
Owen W. Phelps got nineteen bush
els of wheat to the acre and fifty bush
els of- oats. The quality is good.
JEANNETTE RANKIN TEAS
Registration teas are the latest in
novation in campaign methods, used
by the supporters of Miss Jeannette
Rankin, republican candidate for
congress.
Pretinct leaders
al
; most every county are planning to
. ., , . .
take up the idea, and it is estimated
, ' , , „ ,
that several thousand of these en
Î tertainments will be held in the in- ;
terests of Miss Rankin's candidacy i
I within the month. !
The leaders in each precinct and J
in many cases ,the workers in each \
\ city block, are holding informal teas, j
and inviting the unregistered women '
in their distircts to attend. A no- j
ta'ry public is on hand with registra- |
tion blanks ,and each guest is regis
tered and becomes a bona fide voter
before she leaves the party.

EMPTY RIFLE CAUSES ACCIDENT
What might have proved a deplor- j
î able accident occurred at the H. O. I
! Lund home northwest of Hinsdale on ,
,, . . i , • i î
Monday morning, when his youngest i
. gQn Burdiek, pointed what was sup

at ]yi e l \ i n Hammerness and pulled the

chest inflicting a painful but not seri

The injured boy has been receiving j
j medical care by Dr. T. L. Cockrell in !
this city and the wound is healing j
rapidly. j

j HURT IN AUTO ACCIDENT
While returning home from Saco !
; Tuesday night during the heavy rain, '
Charles Hunter, a pioneer rancher of i
of^^p c ai . -, country had a very narrow I
escapH from death when the big tou>-- I
i r ,g C ar which he was driving skidded
off the grade and aimed over on top
0 f him. He was badly lacerated about
tne face and head, one ear being al- 1
most torn off. lie was brought down j
to the Deaconess hospital in this city
; the same evening pnJ is rapidly re- j
at this writing.
î r «.î 4-u u•
nine members of the threshing crew j
labored to liberate him, prying the
wheels loose with crow-bars.
In the meantime Williston doctors
were summoned to the scene. The ac
cident happened about <> o'clock, and
a doctor reached the Stafford farm
shortly after 9 o'clock, but saw at
once that it was impossible to do any
thing to save the unfortunate man's
life. Everything possible to ease the
intense suffering of the victim was
done, but after hours of the most
horrible agony he died at 11 o'clock
that night. Before death he pleaded
with those about him to shoot him
or to get him a revolver to end his
sufferings.
Kelly was a single man who had a !
homestead at Wolf Point. He is r -ur- j
vived by a sister, who lives in Minne- j
sota, where the body was sent for
burial.

GREAT PICTURE
COMING SOQN
t he Birth Or A Nation" World's
Greatest Picture Coming Here |
One of the most touching situations !
î The Birth Of A Nation is the '
j meeting of the southern brother and J
! sister at the old doorway after the
I war. ]
Four years before she had been a j
happy, carefree, little girl, petted and j
waited upon hand and foot by her
father's faithful slaves—and he had i
a fine, young southern gentle-j
man. j
Now they meet for the first time !
j since the grand old days—in rags '
and poverty—all but heartbroken—i
their slaves gone.
The fury of an age has possed over i
.1 ■ r , , , . j, I
ther youthful heads since just
; years ago, and ohl what a succession
of miseries has befallen the proud j
Cameron family since that eventful j
night.
Mora and Bon's two younger broth-j
| era had first been taken I y the car-j
nage of battle; their stately southern '
home had been again and again sack
ed, pillaged and set on fire by marau.l- i
fing bands of guerillas and this tend- j
erly rearc 1 family, which had never |
known else thi.n ease and luxury had !
gers, and now had foolish ideas in
their heads. Instead of the former
! faithful servants, they had .now be
j come like the rest of their kind, a
been brought down to poverty—evei
vaut.
Their once contented slaves had fol
; lowed 1'.ie smooth-talking carpet-bag
onslaughts of war—even
cheerful and prosperous
dangtrosu menace to the country.
The great plantation was deserted
1 —full of weeds and riddled from the
the once
Piedmont
j street, upon which their mansion
■ stands, is now tenantless, except x'or
the rioting negroes whom occasionally
j take possession of it to terrorize th^
: whites; a tattered, deserted relic of
the past.
And now the little sister waits to
j g ree t her brothpr for the first time
since the terrible changed conditions.
Never would either forget the night i
, .. , . , I
he proudly departed up that village
mond's historic ball in Brussells, on j
street., at the head of his regimen*, j
It was on the night after the Con
federate victory at Bull Run, and a
grand, old fashioned ball, in honor
of the Piedmont Guards was still in
progress.
Not unlike the
Duchess of Rich
the eve of the Battle of Waterloo, it
■ had held vouth anJ bpa far intQ
^ ^ ^ hours How the da „ c _
! ers j lad dwe jj ed U p on one particular
dance, in which they swayed to the
j strains of "Comin' Thro' The Rye"—
on that far-off night of memories.
Pathetic efforts have just been made
! in the household to prepare a fitting
reception for the returning brother—i
and to the sweet and softly sighing]
chords of My Old Kentucky Home,
< this shabby and battle-marked hero'
of the grand old family steps upon
scene—but, oh!
the dear familiar
What a change!
Brother and sister moet—both in
rags, both bravely trying to bridge
over with forced gayety the sweeping
[change since last thej met, there on
that same old stoop. .
He makes the discovery that the
majestic ermine his dear little lady
sister wears is only raw cotton,
smudged with soot and she taunts him
over the tatters in his hat.
In a moment the full flood of real
ization breaks over both, and, as mem
ory brings to their fancy a vision of
that last dance and a far-awav fancv
.
,of Comin Thro The Rye', they break
down and fall into each other's arms ;
—two, poor, sobbing victims of an
awful national mistake. !

W.s thought they would run over to
a nearby well and get a drink, but

started so they immediately began
box cars. The brakemen, with words
that would be deleted by censor, warn
