1 F THlE occupation of Ruauda, Getr
man East Africa, by Belgian troops
from the Congo. and their estab
Slishment of a provisional govern
ment in this territory prove to be per
manent Belgium will possess the most
densely populated as well as one of
Tme most fertile and salubrious terri
tories of central Africa, says a bulle
tin of the National Geographic society.
Ruanda lies to the east of Lake
Klvu, through which runs the bound
try line between the Upper Congo re
lion and the German possessions. To
the north lies British East Africa. The
Kagera river, also known as the Alex
andra Nile, flowing in irregular S
shape, east, north and west, and empty
ng into Lake Victoria Nyanza, is the
eastern boundary.
While there are two considerable
tracts of forest in Ruanda, the central
portion of the territory is bare of
trees, but on the mountain slopes there
is to be found wonderfully rich grass,
on which graze magnificent herds of
tattle that constitute the chief wealth
of the natives. The agricultural possi
bilities of the region are almost unlim
Ited.
One of the most striking advantages
of this territory is its high altitude, an
average of nearly a mile above sea
level, so that although it lies under
an equatorial sun, the temperature is
usually about the same as that of a
warm summer day in central Europe.
Malarial mosquitoes are not known
here, nor does the dread tsetse-fly hov
er over the land, bringing sleeping
sickness to human beings and quicker
death to cattle.
Contrasts In the Natives.
Two remarkable contr'asts are to be
found among the natives of this re
gion. The highly developed, intelli
gent Watussil are magnificent physical
specimens, lithe, well-proportioned and
athletic. It is not uncommon to meet
men from five feet eleven inches to
seven feet two inches tall. On the oth
er hand, on the island of Kwidschwel,
In Lake Kivu, and in the bamboo for
ests of Bugole the traveler finds the
pygmy Batwa tribe, whose spear-car
rying warriors are under five feet In
height, shy, timid and devoted almost

entirely to the chase. The aborigines
belong to neither of these tribes, how
ever, but are the Wahutu, a medium
sized, agricultural people. The black
sultan of the region, one of the world's
most powerful potentates ruling in ter
ritory held by white colonists, is a
Watussi. His word, subject to the cen
sorship of the European resident or
governor, is law to a million and a half
people.
There is abundant water in Ruanda,
the small mountain streams never run
ning dry. When the grass becomes
parched on the hillsides, the natives
burn it off and immediately there
springs up fresh, tender pasturage for
the cattle.
The perfunctory salutation among
friends is one of the interesting cus
toms of the country. Upon meeting
they either place their arms lightly
about the waist or else grasp each
other's elbows, holding them for a
while, then one declares "I wish you
cattle," while the other replies, "I wish
you women."
Pirst Explored by Von Gotzen.
This region was first explored in
1804 by Count von Gotsen, formerly
governor of German East Africa, who
came from the coast as far as Lake
Kivu, about which Arab traders had
frequently brought vague reports.
This beautiful, island-dotted body of
water, 5,000 feet above sea level, was
the last considerable lake to be dis
covered in central Africa. Its outlet
is the Rufa river, which flows south
Into the famous Lake Tanganyika.
One of the most noted parties of ex
ploration which has visited Ruanda
was that headed by Adolphus r-ed-
Ick, dake a h Yulebug, wvh
marcned through the territory with an
impressive retinue of carriers in 1907-8.
In his report he said of this region:
"Ruanda is eminently adapted for col
onization by white men. The country
possesses a fabulous amount of wealth
in its herds, to the breeding of which
its pastoral people are particularly de
voted. Also agriculture may be car
ried on in a remunerative way, for the
quality of the cattle itself is as ex
cellent as that of the milk they yield.
As to the quality of the soil, it simply
leaves nothing to be desired, so that
it is evident that there is a splendid
opening here for the establishment of
business on a vast scale."
Immense Territory Involved.
When the American public reads
that the troops of the Belgian Congo
have defeated the colonial troops of
German East Africa at Shangugu and
that the victors are proceeding south
ward from Lake Klvu in the direction
of Lake Tanganyika, it is hard to re
alize that the two colonial possessions
involved have a combined area four
fifths as large as all of continental Eu
rope, the Russian empire excepted.
Belgium's territory alone in this quar
ter of the globe is 80 times as large
as the mother country, while the pop
ulation of the Jungle wilds of the
Congo basin is variously estimated at
from 14,000,000 to 30,000,000. The Ger
man colony is nearly double the area
of the home country, while the popu
lation is estimated at 8,000,000. In
both possessions, however, the number
of Europeans, chiefly officers of the
home government, does not exceed a
few thousands.
Shangugu lies on the southern shore
of Lake Klvu, which has an area al
most as large as the state of Rhode
Island and is nearly a mile above sea
level, with gigantic volcanic peaks
looking down upon it from the north.
The most interesting settlement in
German East Africa is Ujiji, a town
of 14,000 inhabitants, chiefly Arabs.
This slave and ivory mart of the nine
teenth century was first visited by Eu
ropeans in 1858, when Richard Burton
and J. H. Speke discovered Lake
Tanganylki, on whose eastern shores
the town is situated. Of even more in
terest, however, Is the fact that it was
here that Henry M. Stanley's famous
undertaking to find the lost explorer,
,David Livingstone was accomplished
on October 28, 1871.
Experience Proves It
We see in one of these New York
papers that women have a "Heredi
tary Fear of Man," that this fear has
come prowling down the ages from
the time when woman was not safe
from the predatory male, and so on.
Yes, we can prove it. Some twenty
odd years ago or more we came face
to face with our teacher over a small
difference of opinion concerning a
matter of deportment. We looked her
right in the eye as lion tamers do now
In moving pictures, and we talked up
as United States senators have al
ways done. We remnember very clearly
the haste with which she grabbed into
her desk for her ruler. That hereditary
fear was working. Over what fol
lowed we draw a veil-no doubt she
did it in self-defense and the interests
of culture. We are still sorry we
scared her so badly and it is rather
nice to know that it was really her
fear of us that made us such a model
pupil for the next week or two. You
see they didn't have all the advantages
of sociology back in 1880-odd. but we
can all live and learn and read the
paperu--Collier's.

A MATTER OF MEDICINE.
For many years Doctor Eustachy
had been the leading physician of Per
tuls, a town in the south of France.
His professional reputation was so
high that he often was summoned to
distant places, and many people won
dered why he persisted in hiding his
light under a bushel, by dwelling in a
country village; but the doctor held
that it is better to be first in Per
tuis than second in Paris.
Personally he was not exactly popu
lar, because of his temper, over which
he had poor control. Small things ex
asperated him to an unseemly de
gree, and when he was warm under
the collar it took him a long time to
cool down. So it happened that when
Doctor Tournatoire arrived in Pertuls,
announcing that he had come to stay,
and was prepared to furnish pills in
any quantity, many of the leading citi
zens, who were tired of Doe Es
tachy's tantrums, gave the young man
the glad hand.
Tournatoire had been graduated
from the best of medical schools, he
was highly recommended, and he soon
demonstrated that his skill was great
His manners were most engaging, and
he had a comforting way with patients
that was quite as effective as his medi
cine. He became popular at once,

Trying to Put the Dog In thetow.b
and his practice grew in a manner
that must have been gratifying.
All this was gall and wormwood to
old Doc Eustachy, who found himself
almost abandoned by his townsmen.
The calls for his services became so
Infrequent that he spent most of his
time in his dingy office, calling down
maledictions upon his young rival. He
hadn't pride enough to keep quiet. He
talked of nothing but Tournatoire,
whom he denounced as a quack, an
impostor, and everything else unpleas
ant. He became such a bore that peo
ple avoided him, and when he went
for a walk he had the whole street
to himself. Meanwhile business was
humming with Doctor Tournatoire,
who frolicked over the countryside,
cutting off people's limbs and feeding
them with pills, in the merriest way
imaginable.
This went on for two or three years,
and in 1884 Tournatoire was urged to
ran for a local dffice, so he placed him
self in the hands of his friends, ex
plaining that he always was ready to
bleed and die for the flag at a moment's
notice. This public spirited conduct
was more than Eustachy could stand.
Ie determined to be a candidate him
self, and thus bring humiliation to his
rival. He had the idea that he had
enough friends and sympathizers to
elect him, but when the votes were
counted Eustachy was the most pro
nounced kind of an also ran. He didn't
have a look' in. And he was so mad
over it that he howled like a wolf.
A day or two after the election the
people of Pertuis woke to find the
town plastered with handbills in which
Tournatoire was held up to scorn as a
moral leper, and a professional shy
ster, and a few other things. All
the wire-edged words in the French
language were used in the effort to do
him Justice. The people were called
upon to rise as one man and ran the
faker out of the community. Doctor
Tournetoire stood by a deadwall and
read the hand bill, and his lips whit
ened, and a cold sweat stood on his
forehead.
"Parbleu !" said he, in the absence
of a good American cussword. "This
Is going too far "
So he had old Doe Wlstachy arrest
ed os a chartg t libel, and it was
eaq to preyv his rcspaeblBlty. It.
old doe was convicted and fined, and
returned to his oice madder than
ever.
Six weeks later Tournatoire invited
some of his friends to a little banquet
at his home, and on the afternoon of
the festive day a basket of game ar
rived at the house. Half a dosen beau
tiful thrushes were in the basket. The
thrushes were cooked, but there was
such an abundance of good things at
the feast that nobody ate them. The
guests dispersed at a late hour, well
fed and happy, and no doubt "One
Wo Was There" wrote a story of the
joyous occasion for the local paper.
On the following morning Doctor
Tournatoire returned from his oice
to his home on some errand, and, upon
entering, was astonished to And his
wife trying to stand on her head. As
sisting her to her feet, he asked her
what she was trying to do, and she
began explaining that all her relatives
were dead, her husband killed in a
duel, and she wanted to die herself.
The pupils of her eyes were extraor
dinary dilated, and she acted like a
woman both crazy and blind. The
doctor, alarmed, went into the kitchen
to question the cook, and found her
trying to put the dog in the stove.
The dog was a large one, and defended
itself heroically, but the cook seemed
to have superhuman strength, and she
considered the work of cremation
highly important, The doctor rescued
the dog, and tried to get some in
formation from the woman, but she
would talk of nothing but death. Ev
erybody was dead, she said, and she
had received a spirit message ordering
her to put the dog in the stove. Her
eyes also were dilated, and she seemed
half blind.
A layman in such a painful position
would have thought it a plain case of
insanity, but the dotor, after a mo
ment's consideratioi, decided what
was the trouble.
"They have been poisoned with sal
phate of atropine," said he, and gov
erned himself accordingly, to such
good purpose that the two women were
convalescent in a few days.
They explained that they had each
eaten a thrush that morning, and sick
ness followed, and they remembered
no more. The doctor examined the
remaining birds, and found them sat
urated with the poison. The news was
made public, and It was taken for
granted at once that Eustachy had
been playing another of his pranks.
The old doctor was arrested, and
strong evidence against him soon was
forthcoming. It was easily established
that he had bought atropine paste of
a druggist; also that he had won d
prize of game in a local lottery, and
his prize was six thrushes. When the
evidence thus. became formidable the
old doctor confessed, but said that he I
was merely trying to play a practical
joke on Tournatoire. The courts of
France, like those of the other coMn
tries, had not much appreciation of
humor, so Eustachy was convicted and
sentenced to eight yearspof toil with
out recompense in prison.
So- this eminent physician, wearing
fetters, left the town where he had
long been honored and respected, to
take his place among felons, and all
because he could not overcome his
jealous spirit. It is unnecessary to
tack a moral to the story.
The case is celebrated in criminal
annals because it Is the only one of
its kind. Doctors may, and doubtless
do. hate each other now and then, but
Eustachy was the only one on record
who tried to remove a rival by
poison.
Gretley's Profanity.
Early in my reporter days on the
New York Tribune I was detailed on
an election night to assist in tabulat
ing election returns in a room adjoin
ing Horace Greeley's "den" (on the
second floor of the ancient, drab-hued,
brick building). Raised, as I have
been, in the West, with reverence for
Greeley only second to that of my
maker, the shock to my nerves, when
I heard him swear continuously for a
quarter of an hour, is indescribable. He
was the most profane man, except John
A. Cockrell, I ever encountered and I
have been around somewhat.-Brook
