BAD WEEK FOB GERMANS.
Grccco Coming Into War and Anglo
Pronch Forces Winning Steadily on
Sommo Front.
Every week brings fresh evidence
that the tide of war Js setting strongly
against the OormnoBj-jiid"tIiol'r olllca
nnd that victory" will eventually crown
tho efforts of the entente powers. The
entrance of Rumania into' tho war
against the Teutons will be followed at
once by the active participation of
Orecco on the side of Great Britain,
Frnuce and other countries. Greece lias
sent an ultimatum to Bulgaria, demand
ing the immediate evacuation of all
Greek Macedonia. The Greek troops
are mobilized and it is reported from
Athens that somo of tho Greek war
ships have already joined those of the
entente.
Combles, the pivotal point in the
German line guarding tho approach to
Bapaume, on tho north, and 1'eronne, on
the south of the Somnie lront, has tallcn
before the attacks of the French and
British. ' French and British troops
swept in from three sides nftcr their
capture of Morvul and Fregicourt.
Both Thicpval. at the northwestern
end of tho British line, and the fortified
town of Gueudccourt, northwest ot Les
Boeufs, have also fallen into the hands
of the British. Around the former place
many hard battles have been fought
since tho beginning of the great entente
offensive on July 1. Gen. Sir Douglas
Ilaig's men, after capturing Thicpval,
drove on eastward and took the Zollern
ledoubt, a strongly fortified position
which lies between Thicpval and tho
bend in the British line at Courcelette.
Twelve Zeppelins which raided Lon
don nnd the southenst counties of Kng
land Saturday night killed .'10 persons
and injured 110 others. Of thu casual
tics, 8 men, women nnd children wero
killed, and 91) men, women and children
wero injured in tho metropolitan area
of London. Two of the Zeppolin air
ships, both of a new pattern, were shot
down in Essex. The crew of one was
killed, but the crow of the other, con
sisting of 1'2 men, wero captured. Out
side of the London district, two persons
wero killed and 11 injured in un east
midland town, nnd it is fenred that two
other bodies may be buried in the ruins.
The missiles dropped by the hostile air
craft caused numerous fires, and de

A PROUD RECORD.
We salute Col. Ira L. Beeves and his
officers and men of the First Vermont
regiment on their return to Vermont.
The soldiers will be mustered out, but
will not bo discharged. In other words
'they will return to their homes, but
they will be subject to call for mili
tary service if needed during tho period
for which they enlisted. Tho record
which the regiment made in Texas is
one in which nil loyal Vormontcrs will
feel pride. The regiment did not lose
a man from desertion. Two boys lost
their lives, one from bums nnd the
other from a tropical disensc. Xo other
man was even ill when the soMier3
stepped back on home soil. Col. Reeves
said at Fort Ethan Allen Wednesday:
"The men are in first class health,
hard as nails and bettor equipped for
civil life, or any other life, thnn when
they left Vermont three months ago,
The discipline was strict nnd the work
hard, but the men thrived under it
Their step today- is clastic, their eyes
bright, their skin clenr and their form
erect." This is a very striking showing.
We doubt whether it is equalled by tho
troops of any state in the Union on
duty in a Southern climnto three
months at any timo of the year. When
tho First Vermont regiment went to
Chicknmnugn in 1S08 over 30 solditrrs
paid for their service with their lives
and a largo percentage of those who
returned homo wero shattered in health
for months and years. The improve
ment in sanitation nnd tho knowledge
which has been gained in 18 years in
preventing the contraction of disenses
helped the boys to make such a notablo
showing, but having a trained army
officer like Col. Reeves in command
was a big fnctor, and Vormontcrs
should be quick to recognize and ap
prove of the helpful work of the provi
dent of Xorwich university.
It doesn't tnke much to start a strike
these days. In one eastern city there
are two strikes in progress, one being
ngninst a manufacturing concern be
cause it will not compel its non-union
help to join the union. The other is a
stiike of cignr makers who hnvo walked
out because they cannot havo nil the
cigars they want to smoke frco of cost.
Why should not all workers havo n frco
swing at the goods produced ! What
kind of a country are we living in, any
how? We know nothing ubout Andrew L.
Bowen, who died in South Dorset this
week, except that for a long term of
years he had written nlmost overy week
to the Londonderry Sifter nrticles
signed "Si Clone." Some of his work
was crude, but the writer had an origi
nal style and an effectivo touch in slam
ming shams nnd foibles nnd weaknesses
in public officials and matters of pub
lie policy. Personally wo shall miss
"Si Clone." He was nlways entertain
ing and frequently gave the reader
something to think about seriously.
America 's best in tho dairy lino will
bo at the Nationnl Dairy show in Spring
field, Mass. Tho Vermont Guernsey
Breeders' association has already mado
preparations to bo properly represent
ed in tho competition against tho finest
herds of tho country. As n plain busi
ness proposition Vermont dnirymen
and farmers cannot afford to stay away
from this show, while thousands not
actually in thu dairying business will
find the visit to Springfield interesting
nnd perhaps profitable. It is not alone
in the study of cuttle, but in tho ob
servation of new methods' which point
the way to new economies, Hint tho
show will be of value to the former.
Tho experiment of stocking West
river with stcelhcad trout will bo
watched with jntorest by nil anglers
in Windham county. West rivor is
in the main a shallow stream, but nt
Various points fine pools aro found.
Black bass nt present furnish tho main
sport in tho river, lint they tiro not
caught to any extent nbovo the Brook
lino bridge. Yearn ago West river, in
co:ninoii with other largo stromas
hereabouts, furnished salmon Ashing.
Tho water Is not polluted to any great
oxtcnt today, and many good sports
men In this part of the state believe
that fine fishing may bo provided in
the river within n few years if it is
properly stocked.
Tho embattled farmers of Southern
Vermont who ship their milk for dis
tribution in Boston have taken a firm
stand in favor of an increased price for
their product. T hcv want what
amount to about n cent n quart
more, nnd if the price is not forthcom
ing they will stop shipments. Hero's
hoping they get their price, and wo be
lieve they will. There is nothing that
compares with milk as nu all-around
food and it is nn absolutely essential
commodity. With the advance in all
other kinds of foodstuffs it is doubtful
whether the consumer gets more for his
money, even in the largo cities, than
when he buys milk. Certainly milk
prices are not commensurate with thoso
of other foods in every day use.
The beneficial effect of the Euro
pean war upon financial conditions
in tho United Stntoj was made impres
sive by the announcement n few days
ago that the government has now nt
its sub-trensury in Now York city
about $500,000,0(10 of gold the largest
amount of gold over brought together
in one place in the history of tho world.
Statisticians estimate that if tho war
continues one year more it will send
back to the United States every stock
and bond and evidence of indebtedness
held in any other country against tho
industries nnd finances of tho United
States. If that should occur, tho
United States would be for the first
time in its history n creditor nation.
These few facts serve to demolish com
pletely the claim of the Democrats that
it is not the war that has brought our
present prosperity.
There is a long story connected with
tho campaign in Xew Jersey, which
ended with the primaries Tuesday, in
which Senator Martino securod tho
Dpmocrntic nomination for nnothcr
term in Washington by about 20,000
votes. Senator Martino was ono of Pres
ident Wilson 's most loyal supporters.
He fought for Mr. Wilson's original
nomination for Xow Jersey six years
ago. His speeches for the "poor man's
friend" will not be forgotten. Senator
Martinc was a powerful asset in that
gubernatorial campaign nnd with Mr.
Wilson's nomination for the presiden
cy nt Baltimore, he was tho same friend.
Mnrtine was a support worth keeping.
But time chnuged conditions. When
Mr. Wilson got to the Whito House
and the matter of patronage enmo
along in Xew Jersey Senator Martino
very naturally wished to control his
generous share of it. But there was an
other big man higher up, ono closo to
Wilson, who wished tho say in this
matter and Martiue was thrown down.
Since then thero lias been only a color
less friendship between the men. This
year it camo Senator Martinc 's turn
to make the campaign for his own re
election. Here was where the Presidont
got in his work. Ho fnvored Judge
Wcscott, who hod presented his nnme
at two national conventions, and
throw all his strength for him. Presi
dent Wilson lost his man and his pres
tigo in his own stnte has gotten a bad
jolt.

CHEERS FOR GIBSON
Vermont Regiment Back at Fort
Ethan Allen
Company
Greets Commander Enthu-
slastlcally.
Wlth Rccruita Now Has
105 Men.
FORT ETHAX ALLEN, Sept. 28.
The 1st Vermont Infantry arrived at
Forth Ethan Allen at 8 o'clock Wednes
day morning and the men were im
mediately quartered in the barracks as
signed to them. Company I is occupying
the ambulance company barracks, together
with Company G and Company H, tho
bat racks having been vacated that morn
ing by the recruits. The recruits were as
signed to various companies, Company I
!: n- I . ,,
Kiumiig -i men, unnging us total sircngtii
to 0o enlisted men.
Every man of the company is in excel
lent health. Private Smith, who recently
undeiwcnt an operation for appendicitis,
was able to tcturn with the regiment and
stood the trip very well.
The members of the company greeted
Captain Gibson with cheers when lie first
appeared before them and for a 'few min
utes military discipline was put aBido as
each man shook hands with him.
C. A. Pellctt returns as acting first ser
geant. Lieut. Spauiding reported for
duty Monday ahd has been quartered witti
Captain unison. Lieut. Miner was trans
ferred back to the regiment from the 30th
Infantry and letumcd with the company.
A team to icpiescnt the regiment nt tho
national rille competition will be selected
in a few dnys, It is expected that Com
pany I will bo represented at thii meet,
which takes place in Jacksonville, Fla.,
Oct. 20. The team to represent Vermont
will leave immediately after the muster
out of the regiment.
It is understood that it was intended to
Uho part of the cars used on the trip from
lexas to transport the recruits to the bor
der. It is said that tho routing was com
plete and everything ready when the war
department changed its plans nnd ordered
muster out. Thus for the third time
the hopes of the recruits to see some real
hervico on outpost duty were dnshed to
the ground. It is a wonder to all familiar
with the real facts in connection with the
handling of the Vermont recruits tlmt
these men have been attentive to their
duties. Their conduct, in the face of dis
couragements, speaks well for them and
the regiment of which they are a part.
It is apparent that when the members
of Company I aro released froni.thq fed
eral scrvico some of them will have ttifn'ga"
of interest to eay in regard to their tour
of duty on the Rio Grande.
In an interview Col. Ira L. Reeves said:
"The coming of the National Guard to
the border instilled fear in the Mexicans
and in my opinion stopped a war Itetwewi
Mexico and the United States.
"The men aro naturally glad to get
home, but they weie perfectly willing to
stay longer and no complaint wns heard
to my knowledge of treatment or food.
"On Saturday before we broke camp tho
legimcnt with the 30th U. S. Infantry
went for a practice hike. The regulars
started out to clean up the Vcrmontcrs,
but at the end of the hike a number of
the 30th boys were riding in the nmbu
lanccs, while the remainder were strung
out along the road like a boys' catch of
fish. We did 12,2 miles in 3 hours nnd 15
minutes. Xot bad walking under heavy
equipment for that climate.
"Ve were actively engaged in outpost
duty for several weeks and off nnd on the
Vermont, boys were in complete charge of
the Ameiican side of the International
bridges nt Eagle Pass.
"Every man must pass a physical exam
ination lrefore he cm be released from the
government military service and this will
require possibly a week.
"We left Eagle Pass last Wednesday,
pulling out of the camp nt 12.42 p. in.
Our cars had to 1k thoroughly disinfected
because measles had broken out among tba
men of the Tennessee regiment that pre
viously occupied them. The trip was made
by wnv of Xew Orleans, St. Louis, Chi
cago, Buffalo, Rotterdam Junction, North
Bennington and Rutland to Burlington.
"We weie handled like cattle trains until
we struck the Rutland railroad. On this
fond we received tho best treatment, the
best service in the entire 2,700-milc journey.
At Syracuse, or a short distance from that
city, I tliieatcncd to take tho men from
the train nnd pitch camp unless we were
moved along. The stop there wns over
three hours' in duration and for no appar
ent reason whatsoever.
"The men are in first-class health, hard
as nails and better equipped for civil life,
or any other life, than when they left
Vermont three months ngo. The discipline
was sttict and tiie woik hard, but the men
thrived under it. Their step today is
clastic, their eyes bright, their skin clear
and their form erect.
"The Vermont regiment didn't have a
deserter in the ranks nnd there were few
court martinis. "
Colonel Reeves has yet no order to
muster out the regiment, but expects it
soon. Captain Diiler has been detailed
to do tho work.
The regiment brought back 14 horses.
They used 100 mules and 50 horses at
ICaclo Pass.
Tho Company C men, tho University
of Vermont company, wero promptly
given discharges from tho service after
their arrival. Tho other men of tho
regiment will bo mustered out of the
servien of tho United States, but not
discharged. They will therefore ho
subject to further coll at any time. In
nil probability Company O will bo re
organized nt somo other place. It Is
cortain that another company will not
be organized at tho Univorslty of Ver
mont. Tho muster out will proceed by bat
talions. Tho third battaliou will bo tho
first to bo mustered out. It will tako
