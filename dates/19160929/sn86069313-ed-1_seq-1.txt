Gov. A. "0. Stanloy, wlio promised
In hit) Inaugural address that ho
would make It his chief business to
sec that Kentucky geU a dollar's
worth of work for ever dollar paid
to ItH employes, Is quoted in a news
paper Interview as declaring that ho
will carry out this promlso even If It
destroys his political prospects.
"No man can Idle away his tlmo
nnd stay on the Stnte's payroll, If It
Is in my power to put him off of It."
the interviewer quotes Gov. Stanley
as declaring. This quotation Is tak
en from an extended Intcrvlow upon
the subject of efficiency In public of
fice. It Gov. Stanley Is In earnest In his
demand for efficient public servants,
one wonders why ho permits sonic of
tlio most highly-salaried members of
Ills olllclal family to devote their time
to the management of the present
Democratic campaign.
High Sularlc Paid.
Tho Democratic State Campaign
Executive Committee, which has full
cliargo and control of the fight In
Kentucky, Is composed almost en
tirely of appointees of Gov. Stanley,
who uro paid big salaries by the tax
payers of Kentucky. Gov. Stanloy Is
firmly in tho saddle In Democratic
organization -affairs, and this con
rnitteo was designated with his full
approval.
Tho Democratic Campaign Execu
tive Commttteo Is composed of Con
gressman J. Campbell Cnntrlll, chair
man; Thomas D. Pannell, Ell H.
Drown, Jr.; S. V. Hagor, Dr. Mil
ton Board and Forrest Dutts, all of
whom, except Mr. Butts, are public
servants.
Mr. Cantrlll Is Congressman from
tho Seventh District, drawing a sal
ary of $7,500 a year. Since Con
gress Is not In session, there is noth
ing improper, of course, in his de
voting his tlmo to tho campaign. A
different situation Is presented, how
ever, in tho case of the other mem
bers. Mr. Pannell Is State Fire Marshal
at a salary of $3,000 a year one
of tho "firo-putters-out" that Gov.
Stanley attacked' vigorously In his
recent campaign. In addition, ho Is
secretary of the Democratic Cam
paign Committee.
Brown Is Another.
Ell H. Brown, Jr., is attorney for
tho State Insurance Hating Board,
drawing a salary of $3,000 a year.
S. W. Hager Is a member of tho
Kentucky Workmen's Compensation
Board at a salary of $3,500 a year.
Dr. Milton Board is tho Medical
Director of tho Kentucky Workmen's
-Compensation Board at a salary of
$3,000 a year. In addition he Is tho
Kcgistrar -of Vital Statistics, entitled
to a fco of 25 cents for every certifi
cate of birth or death issued.
Mr. Butts Is a Cnrrollton business
nan.
Upon thU Executtvo Committee,
composed almost excluBlvoly of pub
lic servants drawing salaries from
the taxpayors, lies tho responsibili
ty of carrying Kentucky for Mar
shall and Wilson.
This committee was chosen with
Gov. Stanley's sanction and approv
ul. In view of his complete domi
nance in tho affairs of his party, it is
probable that ho selected them, hhn
.solf. At least, a word from him
would have kept thoso high-salaried
public servants off tho committee.
Is It u DolInr'H Worth?
Does Gpv. Stauloy bollovo that
these men, burdened with tho heavy
responsibility of conducting au im
.portunt State campaign, cau glvo
Kentucky's taxpayers a dollar's
worth of work for ovory dollar paid
them?
It he does, he Is almost alono In

"Jack" and "Homer" as allasos, is
said to he tho son of a wealthy St.

engaged In the haberdashery busi
ness. "The language nnd manners ot
this band would deceive anyone,"
West fcald. "Tho woman proposed
tho trip to me. On May 9 we reach
ed New York and went to the An

three men armed with Federal war
rants and badges forced their way
Into my room. Buda Godman be
camo hysterical. She Bald alio was
a convent-bred girl, and that her
parents would commit sulctdo over
tho disgrace. She asked tusm what
she would) do to save herself from
dlsgruce and then the question of
money was adroitly broached.
"Before I know It we wore in two
Btaterooms racing back to Chicago.
Wo wero kept prisoner three or four
days, and then becnuso tho woman
had been crying all the time and ap
pealed to my chivalry to save her, I
paid them $12,500 cash. Several
days after Irwin, who represented
himself as United States Commis
sioner Footo, released us after they
obtained $2,500 moro from me."

Whereas, marketing conditions in

ENGLAND WITHDRAWS
HER TOBACCO ORDER
STRIKES OUT REGULATIONS ON
CIGAR LEAP AND RESTORES
OLD ORDER.
Washlngton, Sept. 27. Great Brit
ain has withdrawn regulations for
the importation of cigar tobacco,
Which American growers have declar
ed would ruin their business, and au
thorized Imports on the basis of thoso
in 1913, 1914 and 1915.
Consul General Skinner at Lon
don cabled the State Department to
day of the change. The original reg
ulation governing Imports"- ot cigar;
tobacco between June 1, 1915, and
May 31, 1917, wero based on the
amount that the importer had bought
In 1915, a war year in which' .Imports
wero small. Tho new order, accord
ing to the Department ot Commerce
officials, gives authority for practic
ally normal Imports of American to
bacco Into Great Britain.
The tobacco affected comes large
ly from Florida, Connecticut, Wis-,
consin and Pennsylvania.

HARTFORD TO BE

WESTERN KENTUCKY ASSOCLV
TIONS MAY AGREE ON DATES
FOR NEXT YEAR.
1916 MEET A SUCCESS
jOvcr Slv Thousand People Attend
j? On Last Day Company Makes
, ' .Expenses.
A movement Is under way among
fair associations of Western Ken-"
tucky to organize a circuit such as
are had in other sections beforo next
season. Secretary Slmmerman of
the Ohio County Fair , Company, Is
authority for the statement and is
also very enthusiastic over the idea.
If tho plan goes through Owensboro,
Hartford, Morgantown, Adalrvlllo
and Bowling Green aro likely to ba
some of the towns composing the cir
cuit. Such a circuit would mean
more horses, better accommodations!
for privilege people and better fairs
In general. The long jumps neces
sary for those now maklrig the fairs
In this district would, thus bo avoid
ed for the chain would be so arrang
ed that It would be only a short dis
tance from one fair to the next.
The 1916 meet of the Ohio County
Fair was a success In every particu
lar and. practically all who attended
were high in their compliments for
the manner lnN which the fair was
conducted. The company made the
expenses of the meet and a little over
and members of the association say
they are satisfied to do that well tot
the first year. The same company
will give the fairs in the future. Tho
date for next year's meet has not
been decided and can not bo given
out until It is learned whether or not
the circuit will be organized.
Saturday, as usual, proved the bis
day of tho fair and over six thous
and people were within tho enclos
ure. The attendance was cut short
the other two days on account ot
threatening weather. Tho racing
was exceptionally good this year and
hair breadth finishes wero not tin-
common.
Many people from Owensboro and
Daviess county came over for the
fair Friday and Saturday and wero
welcomed with open arms by Ohio.
Tho distance between Owensboro and
Hartford has shortened with the in
crease In the number of automo
biles and when Ohio county builds
her end of the road it will, only bo
a short drive.
The one-man judge system was a
feature of the show ring end ot tho
fair this year that proved a great
success. Formerly tnreo juugea
made the decision.
Had tho crowd known just what
was taking place there would havo ,
been loud cheering when Miss Nina
Shultz and Mr. Jesse Burgess, both
of Prentiss, wero married In tho sec
retary's stand by Judge Wilson about
three o'clock Saturday a'fternoon.
When the entire audience learns of
the unique wedding tho young cou
plo will havo best wishes of over six
thousand people.
