The swindlers by means of substi

another the cost of which exceeds
$675.
, What is considered strange by the
police1 is the fact that the very man,

Jewelry store, was arrested in their
establishment in J 90 3 where he was
attempting to carry out the same
plans pursued by him a week ago
to defraud the company.

Skull Crushed
HUSBAND IS HELD v
PENDING INQUIRY
Mangled and Charred Body
Is Found In Cellar of
Cottage
Mountainvllle, N. H., Sept. 29. Mrs.
Fred L. Small, wife of a Boston real
estate broker, who was burned in a
fire which destroyed the Small sum
mer home at Lake Ossipee, last night,
waa first strangled by a rope tied
about her neck and beaten over the
head, it was discovered when hef
body was taken from the ruins to
day. It is believed by the police that the
fire was set to cover the crime. By a
mere chance, however, this ruse failed.
The body dropped with the burning
floor into the basement and the head
and neck lodged In a pool of water.
The rope which had been drawn tight
around the neck and secured In a
square knot In at the back, was pre
served. Mr. Small, who had left the cottage
at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon, six
hours before the fire was discovered,
made, a hurried return by automobile
this morning to assist the police in
their investigation. He stated that he
had left his summer home yesterday
for a business trip to Boston and that
his wife was alone in the cdttage when
he departed.
Frederic L. Small, the husband, re
tired from active business about three
years ago and purchased the, cottage
at Lake Ossipee which had been .the
home of the 'Small for most of the
year. The house stood on the shore
of( the lake two miles from this village-and
was the only occupied place
in the vicinity. The fire had gained
strong headway before anyone was at
tractedNto It and villagers arriving
from a distance were unable to put
it out, . ,
It was some hours later before the
ruins had cooled sufficiently to permit
a search for the missing woman. This
morning the, body was found in the
basement. It appeared that the skull
had been crushed in by a blow, or
blows and also that the body had
been partially burned while resting on
a bed.
High Sheriff Chandler," of. Carroll
County took charge of the investiga
tion when it seemed certain to the
police the case was one 6f murder
instead of suicide. Medical Referee
Home, of Conway, prepared to make
an autopsy and hold an inquest.
Later on his own authority, Sheriff
Chandler placed Small under arrest
and held him at a local hotel pend
ing instructions from the county soli
citor. The local agent of a life insurance
company today made known that in
January, last, he had written a Joint
policy on the lives of Small and his
wife, Mrs. Ariene Small, for $20,000.
He solicited the business, he said, and
both the husband' and wife participat
ed in negotiations that led to the Issu
ance of the policy. ' .
Before his arrest, Small had an
nounced that he would give $1,000 for
the discovery of the person who killed
his wife, adding that he knew of none
who might have had a reason for
wishing to harm her. Some time prior
to the discovery of the noose about
Mrs., Small's neck, her husband sug
gested the possibility that her cloth
ing had caught fire while she was
sitting before a fireplace as was her
custom. After his arrest he refused
to make any statements
The Smalls came to the lake, It is
understood here, from Southborough,
Mass. Mr. Small had told acquaint
ances here that he had retired from
active business but still trades occa
sionally in the stock market. Both
Small and his wife were about 50
years- of age. i
In 1909 . Small sued A. H. Soden,
widely known as one of the three own
ers of the Boston National League
baseball club, for $500,000 for aliena
tion of Mrs. Small's affections. Ho
was awarded) $10,000,

QUESTION RIGHT OF CITY TO
TAKE AWAY JITNEY LICENSES
FOR ORDINANCE INFRACTIONS
A court ruling which may affect the
decision 6f the local police department
to .revoke numerous Jitneurs' licenses
was made today by Judge Scott of the
common pleas court who held that a
city has no right to make an ordi
nance regarding motor vehicles which
would conflict with the state laws.
This decision was given in the case of
the state against Fred Scheidler

costs in the Norwalk city court for
driving a Jitney without a license.
His counsel filed a demurrer which
Judge Scott sustained!.
The Norwalk ordinance provided
that drivers of all Jitneys who charge
less than 20 cents fare must take out

Louis Edgar Browne, of 2351 '
Bunnell street, this city, was the i

With several hundred - sailor f
who came from Greece on u
transport, Browne ran the Kil-j
kis from Newport News, Va.,'to!
Grecian waters, as a lfeutenan-i
commander of the Hellrniai

Browne is now in the Balkans I

He is a graduate of Bridgeport
schools, whence he went 'to the Naval
Academy at Annapolis. Not complet
ing his course there, he entered pews
paper work, first in Bridgeport and
later in Washington, D. C. In the lat-V

Secretary Josephus Daniels of th
Navy Department. . 1
When the United States sold the-
Mississippi and the Idaho to Greece, I
the latter country asked to have,, at

how to manage the craft. This "wast '
impossible, but Secretary Daniels of-'f
fered the post to Browne, who accept-1

Lionaon, sept. z rne aeieciuon io
the revolutionists of the Greek war
ship Hydra in the small hours. of thla
morning has caused great excitement
in this Greek port. The Hydra, an-l
chored under the guns of the arsenal,
last night, was silently boarded at 8
o'clock this morning by a pari of
men in civilian dress.
The loyalist officer in command
was aroused from his bunk and with,
pistols at his head, was forced with
other loyalist officers to embark in v
rowboat. The commander, aeing at
Venizellst, readily surrendered tb
boarders. ,
Two tugs were attached by towj
ropes to the ship and as noiselessly
as possible she slipped her anchor
and was drawn by the tugs from the
company of the other Greek men-of-war.
The tugs towed her to Salamis
Bay where the allied warships are
stationed.
The minister of marine stated to-:
day to The) Associated Press represen- j
tatlve that he regretted the incident
as, while the perpetrators of it arar ,
unknown, owing to their attire, it was
impossible to still the suspicion that
they were not all of them Greeks.
"It is more to be regretted," added.
the minister, "as' it lends to lessen
the prestige the government at a mo-S
ment when it needs all possible j
credit and unity to accomplish the I '
difficult task before it."
