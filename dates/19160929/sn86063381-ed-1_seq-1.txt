RICHARD OLNEY
Saratoga Springs, N. Y., Sept. 29.
Richard Olney's criticism of Charles
E. Hughes and his campaign was an*
swered last night by Mr. Hughes in a
speech before the Republican unoffi
cial state convention which repeated
ly brought the delegates to their feet
to cheer and applauded.
"The distinguished-former, secre
tary of state said in substance that I
doffed my judicial ermine and appear
ed in the motley garb of a seeker for
office," Mr. Hughes said. "I did doff
the judicial ermine and I submit to
you that it fell from my shoulder un
sullied.
"No American need apologize for
being a candidate for office, least of
all I. I had no desire to return to
politics but there came a summons
no honorable man could refuse. I
did assume the garb, call it motley or
what you will. I am now before the
American people seeking the highest
office in its gift.
"For what purpose? Not that I
covet power, but I do covet* the op
portunity, if it is afforded, to main
tain American rights and American
honor."
The record of the administration
in connection with the Adamson law,
Mr. Hughes continued, "was a record
of humiliation." He read from docu
ments to uphold his contention that
instead of facing "a sudden crisis
with no opportunity for inquiry," the
administration was besought by "Am-
erican business, three hundred thou
sand firms and corporations" to make
inquiry a month before the crisis.
