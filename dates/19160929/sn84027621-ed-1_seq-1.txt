BATTLESHIPS OF BRITAIN
Will Have the Biggest Naval Guns in
the World
(Associated Press)
Washington, Sept. 29. Battleships
equipped with 18-inch guns are under
construction in England, according to
unofficial advices, which are given
credence by naval officials here. These
are three inches bigger than any
afloat and are two inches bigger than
those proposed by the United States.
Navy officers say that sixteen-inch
guns can shoot as far as a vessel can
be seen under the most favorable cir
cumstances, so they believe if Eng
land is really building larger ones
they expect to use them against land
fortifications.

LAW WAS NOT LUCID
Consequently Recorder Imposed the
Lightest Fine , Possible on
Visiting Milliners
Involved in the milliners' case be
fore the city recorder yesterday and
his mornings is the question as to
whether or-not the milliners that have
been coming to Ocala for several sea
sons for brief periods should pay the
icense of a merchant, or the license
of an itinerant vendor. The recorder
decided that the milliners coming here
to do business but for a brief period
were itinerant vendors, the license
tax for which is $50. The two millin
ers charged with doing business with
out this license were fined $2 and
costs. They had taken out a merch
ant's license, which amounts to $5 for
the first $1000 of stock, and $1.50 for
ach additional $1000 of stock. '
The question, in its larger sense, is
whether or not anyone conducting a
business here for a brief period, com
peting: with permanent merchants,
should pay a larger tax. It is a ques
tion as to whether the permanent
merchant should be favored.
The two milliners held to be itiner
ant vendors appear to have had diffi
culty in finding out just what license
they should pay. There seems to
lave been no way to determine wheth
er they were itinerant vendors except
by going to court. This done the mil-
iners in the case say that it is not
worth their while to stand the cost of
an appeal.
The question was brought to an is
sue by . the '( local milliners, who in
sisted on the officers taking action.
The local milliners say they do notn
think it is right that when they stay
here the year round, and help bear
the public burdens, that anyone
should come in from the out side,
pay. a nominal fee and then skim the
cream off the- business. They take
the same position, in fact, that the lo
cal merchants take toward peddlers.
It is regrettable, however, that the
visiting milliners could not have been
informed of the exact bearing of the
law before they were subjected to the
inconvenience and expense of legal
action. Both these ladies have many
friends here,-who greatly regret the
annoyance they have had.

We must first extinguish the fire."

ANTHONY
Anthony, Sept. 27. Last Thursday
morning early, white men and colored,
with hoes and rakes began gathering
at the cemetery to clean up and beau
tify the grounds. They worked faith
fully until the noon hour, when the
ladies selected a place under a spread
ing oak tree to have dinner, which
consisted of all the good things imag
inable. After that important event
was over, the men resumed their work,
while the ladies gathered in groups
and enjoyed a social time in a pleas
ant way. Late in the afternoon the
work was completed and all gathered
their tools together, leaving the cem
etery in good condition, with a neat
appearance, showing there had been
no idlers there.
Friday morning the sad news came
that Mrs. Tydings had passed away
and would be laid to rest here by the
side of her husband and son. Dr. J.
M. Gross of Ocala, conducted the ser
vice and made a very appropriate ad
dress. Twenty-eight years ago the writer
with a family landed here from the
far west, strangers in a strange land,
and distinctly remembers the kindness
in both word and deed extended to us
from Mrs. Tydings. Her association
was a benediction; I still remember
the helpful, valuable lessons learned
from her. I wonder if we always ap
preciate kind words and deeds as we
should. As a personal friend and ob
server, I think it can truly be said of
her she hath done what she could.
It seems, this has been a time for
accidents Friday morning little Al
ma Hamilton, the three year old
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Will Ham
ilton was seriously burned with boil
ing water. The accident was caused
by a pillar under the kitchen giving
way, which caused the kitchen stove
to tilt, the kettle of water, which was
on it, pouring on the child. She was
taken to the hospital Sunday morn
ing, but died at three o'clock in the
afternoon. She was brought' home
in a little white casket. The funeral
services were held Monday morning
at the Methodist church, and were
conducted by the pastor, Rev. Rape.
The family has the sympathy of their
friends in this, their sad bereavement,
Last Friday Granvil Priest, the on
ly child of Mr. and Mrs. John Priest,
who had only recently returned from
the hospital where he had been for
sometime suffering from a broken
thigh, had the misfortune to fall and
break the same thigh again. He was
carried back to the hospital to un
dergo another painful operation. The
friends of the family deeply sympa
thize with them.

who is also an inmate of the hospital,
having both arms broke, is getting
along nicely.

proached, the daughters and "in-laws"
arranged two tables in the large din

seated to a "turkey dinner" some of
which had been prepared the day be
fore. Among other nice things on the
table were two beautiful cakes, where

The Shady correspondent "was not
surprised at Mr. Brinson's letter last
week, having heard some of it before.
We will leave the book question for
future discussion though we have
nothing to take back pn the subject.
One thing did surprise us some, too,
and that was that anybody knowing
anything about the past conditions of
Shady school houses could think we
were unappreciative of our new school
building. For thirty years schools
were taught out here in old churches,
gin houses and anywhere except a,
school house. One of the citizens of
this neighborhood gave the county a
deed to one acre of land for a school
house to be built on and a few patrons
put up a small house at their own ex
pense, which was the first real school
house we ever had and this was too
small. A little over two years ago the
county granted us a new building
which is the first and only thing ever
given Shady school by the county.
We are proud of it, justly so, too, for
it is large and roomy' and fills a long
felt want. We wish to extend thanks
for the well in advance. Some of the
natrons have crladlv guaranteed the
$20 as agreed upon to help payfor
it. "A Wail from Shady" has been at
leng intervals heretofore, .and the
Belleview correspondent will please to
note that we have learned from ex
perience to help ourselves so far a3
possible.
