SIEGE OF COMBLES
WHS TERRIBLE
Described as Most Terrific in
History of World, Because
of Extensive Plans iWMe
by the Germans.
ALLIES BUILT NEW ROAD
Street Paved With "v Brick From
Wrecked Houses, Was Used
to Bring Supplies
Forward,
These are some of the dramatic
scenes that preceded the capture of
the strongly fortified village that had
blocked the allied advance, north of
the Somme.
The eventual capture of Combles
became certainty on Tuesday even
ing when French patrols advancing
northeastward and English cavalry
patrols, thrusting southeastward met
eastward of Combles. They thus
completely encircled the village, cut
ting off the last communications
with the German army in the rear.
On the same morning I approached
Combles from the west, starting from
Maricourt, the junction point from
which the French and English- offen
sive was launched Jnly 1 and travers
ing each successive Atep ia 4h» ad»
vance made la the intervening three
months toward the attainment of
this first great objective. When we
arrived within less than a mile and
a quarter of Combles, the town Itself
was then undergoing the final bom
bardment and assault.
Although Combles was a mere vil
lage of 1,500 inhabitants, the Ger
mans had so fortified every house,
especially the cellars where machine
guns were installed, that the allies
were forced to employ siege methods.
They completely enciroled the town
with their heavy artillery, which
gradually closed in with every ad
vance of the infantry lines.
From the viewpoint of the enor
mous quantity of artillery massed
against it and also from the incal
culable number of shells rained into
it, Combles can easily boast of hav
ing undergone the most terrific siege
In the history of the world.
It was only on reaching the most
advanced artillery lines before Com
bles that one could grasp mathematic
ally the methodical progress which
had rendered the allies' new tactics
of advancing by heavy artillery abso
lutely frresitlble, though the final
artillery lines before Combles con
sisted of comparatively light batter
ies. These had been rushed forward
during the night over ground render
ed impassable by shells to everything
but to foot soldiers.
But while troops were tugging guns
across this ground, a veritably army
of soldiers bad sunk a tortuous, wind
ing roadway several feet below the
surface of the ground, paving It with
bricks from nearby houses, wrecked
by artillery fire. Over this, when we
arrived early the next morning, muni
tion caissons, screened from the
enemy's observation by the depth of
the roadway, drawn by four, six and
even eight horses, were dashing
along every moment with an incred-

few minutes when the doorbell rang.
One of the girls answered it and in
going out closod the door, leaving the
man and girl alone in the room in
which there was a bed, it is said.
When the girl returned from
answering the door, she was accom
panied by two men, one of whom
said he was a lawyer. The Iowan
says he was charged with violating
the Mann act, but was advised he
could hush up the affair. He paid
$500, it is said.
Later the lawyer and the two girls
visited the Iowan's home town and
there extotted $4,500. They are sup
posed also to have taken two notes
for $5,000 each. These are said to
have been left with lawyers with the
understanding they would not be
negotiated if there was the slightest
hint at publicity.

BERLIN, Sept. 29.—Chancellor Von
Bethmann-Hollweg's relchstag address,
placing the blame for continuation of
the European slaughter at the door of
Germany's enemies, won enthusiastic
approval from the majority of the
relchstag members toaay.
The chancellor made no offers uf
peace and he Indicated that in view
of the utterances -of allied statesmen,
it would be folly to expect an early
ending of the war.
His speech lacked the hopeful tone
of his former addresses.
"The desire for territorial conquest
by our enemies is responsible for the
daily piling up of mountains of
corpses," said the chancellor. "The
British leave no doubt as to what
they wish to ,do to Germany. They
wish to crush out' our existence as a
nation. A Germany crushed econom
ically, defenseless from the military
standpoint, boycotted by the world
and condemned to eternal feebleness
—that is the Germany England wishes
to see at her feet.
"Then, when England no longer
fears German competition, when
France has been bled to death, when
all her allies are slaves of England,
when European neutrals must submit
to every British order, the dream of
British world-supremacy is to become
a reality.
"A German statesman who would
hesitate to use against this enemy
(England) every available instrument
that would really shorten the war
such a statesman deserves to be
hangett."
Bethmann-Hollweg declared the cen
tral powers have frustrated every plan
of the allies to break -ermany's con
nections with the Orient by crushing
Turkey, Bulgaria or Austria separate
ly. Aside from Isolated allied suc
cesses on the Somme, the senerai sit
uation is unchanged, he added.

Secondly, he will point to the great
prosperity of the country and define
how the administration has placed a
legislative bulwark under this to pre

He plans to offer a constructive
policy to meet the unprecedented eco

when Europe again is able to enter

this he will appeal particularly to the

THAT STATEMENT
RY LLOYD GEORGE
English Press Calls

[By Ed L. Keen, United Press Staff
Correspondent
LONDON, Sept. 29.—Lloyd George's
declaration that'the war must go on
to "a knockout" and his warning to
neutrals to make no peace overtures
at present, contained ln an interview
given the United Press, won the unan
imous support of the English press to
day.
The Lloyd George statement, de
scribed .by the Express as a "historic
manifesto," was printed ln every
morning newspaper ln Great Britain
and telegraphed by all the great news
agencies throughout neutral and allied
countries. The newspapers printed
lengthy editorial comment.
"This really historic manifesto,"
says the Express, "puts In direct and
equivocal words what every man and
woman ln the British empire feels.
Germany's growing conviction that if
the war continues, she must be broken
and beaten inevitably, leads to neutral
agitation for peace.
"American politicians, eager for the
hyphenated vote, undoubtedly would
suggest mediation, asking the belliger
ents to kiss and forget their quarrels.
To all would-be peacemakers,
er In America, Rome, Spain or other
neutral countries, the war secretary
bluntly says:
"Keep out of the ring.'
"It Is at once a declaration of Brit

who would thwort It, that Great Brit

Mail. "Many signs Indicate that Ger

George wisely took an American
journalist into confidence, using
straight from the sliou.der language,
which Americans appreciate.
"These words ought to go a long
way toward enlightening neutrals.
The British people recognize in his
words the proof and echo both of
their spirit and their policy. The
British army afield will be strength

their valor and sacrifices are not

politicians."
