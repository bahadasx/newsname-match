Col. Gardner's Speech.
Fellow Citizen:
A few weeks ago we concluded one
of the most spirited contests for the
nomination for Governor in the his
tory of the Democracy of Missouri.
From the expressions received from
the distinguished Democrats who con
tested the nomination with me and
from those who su ported them, I be
llere I am Justified In sayins that
there Isn't a 'Democrat in this great
commonwealth today who does not
consider that I am hla candidate. I
There shall be no Democratic fac
tions. I expect and know that I will
have all Democrats behind me and
after I am elected all will be taken
Into the party's council. A divided
party Is powerless to fulfill Its pledges
to the public.
From one end of the state to the
other Democracy Is united, confident
FREDERICK D. GARDNER,
Democratic Candidate for Governor.
and militant Victory for the whole
ticket is certain, t want to express
a deep sense of appreciation and obli
gation to the party for the honor con
ferred npon me. and I want you to
know that I am not unmindful of the
responsibility Involved with the com-
i pllment extended. The Governor of
Missouri should represent ths state In
a broad and patriotic way, with an
eye seeing solely the welfare of the
whole people. The present time pre
sents an opportunity for great serv
ice aad It Is my ambition to fulfill ths
noble purposes for which the oftlee
was created and to measure up to Its
highest traditions. I believe that the
destiny of this state can be best work
ed out through, the principles of the
Demooratic party and if elected I will
serve the people In a straightforward,
common sense, business-like way,
without fear or favor.
The Mission ef Democracy.
I am a Democrat because I believe
that the ultimate Ideals and best In
terests of the whole people In. our
state and national life can more com-
K- italy be accomplished through the
moc ratio party than In any other
way. It offers to the Individual the
largest measure of security, the great
est freedom ol conscience, and the
widest liberty of action consistent
with the common good and ths rights
Of others. k
The fundamentals of Democracy are
based upon equality of right and even
ness of opportunity to all as opposed
to special privilege to the few at the
expense of the whole people. Democ
racy does not teach that one man, or
elaei of men, should have advantage
ever the rest, but rather that "that
law Is a Just law which makes for
the tntereet of tne greatest number.'
This Is not a new doctrine It Is as !
eld as the Declaration of Independ-.
emee.
la my opinion these are the price!-1
pies npon which we ean aately stand
aad work oat the aew problems which
confront us by reason of the new con
ditions which are constantly arising
m the development and growth of this
great commonwealth. .
The Campaign far Governor ef lilt. .
So far as I am concerned the oon-,
test with my distinguished opponent
la this race- will not be conducted
along personal Unw. 4 Judge Lamm is
a distinguished lawyer, possessed of
great . learning. '' Interspersed with a
lire vela of wit and humor, and baa .
closed an enviable career on the so-
preme bench ef this state. I don't
know that his professional career baa
famished him any better training for '
the position of chief executive of Mia-,
court than my business experience has 1

turnisnea me.
Of the three departments of gov-!
eminent the Judicial Is necessarily
made up of lawyers; the legislative Is
largely composed of members of the
legal fraternity; and for some tune
past the chief executive of Missouri
has been selected from the bar; the
Attorney General ef Missouri Is neces
sarily a lawyer, so that It does not
seem to me that, facing as we are,
rapidly changing conditions la our
economic and Industrial affairs, It re
quires a lawyer to manage the busi
ness affairs of the state, and that la
after all the Governor's chief func
tion. Therefore 1 do not think that
under the circumstances the experi
ence of a man who has devoted hie
life to the problems of the law, quattf
him any better for the office of Got
ernor than the experience of a busl
ness man who has spent his whole lift
In working out problems of efficiency,
economy and development In the every
day affairs of a growing business be
set with 4)erce competition snd con
stantly changing business conditions.
What we want to apply to present day
questions In Missouri Is not logic and
theory, but rather reason and experi
ence. There Is another difference between
the Republican nominee for Governor
and myseir, and that Is that he stands
for the policy of Republicanism, and
I stand tor the doctrine of Democ
racy. He believes In the principle
enunciated by Alexander Hamilton. I
believe In the philoeophy of Thomas
Jefferson. He is committed to the
fault finding, criticising campaign of
Judge Hughes and I stand for the con
structive, statesmanlike administra
tion of Woodrow Wilson.
He stands for the stand pat, reac
tionary, special privilege, trust Incu
bating Payne-Aldrlch .iff aa the
best method of raising revenues for
ths national government I stand for
.the Underwood tariff, an Income tax.
an Inheritance tax, and a tax on war
aupoUea. The difference Is that his
method ef raising taxes would plaee
the burden on the consumer, ours oa
accumulated wealth, where It can be
more easily borne.
He must stand sponsor for the Re
publican financial legislation which
turned the nation's affairs over to a
half dosen men In Wall street, enabling
tbem to milk the nation at any time
they chose through the so-called
commercial panics. I stand for the
federal reserve act which has forever
done away with such an unbearable
and unjust condition. Just imagine
tbs opportunities the European war
would hare given Wall street to cre
ate financial panica had not the fed
eral reserve act stared them la the
face.
He must stand for the otter failure
of his party to enact during their long
tenure of office progressive laws to
help and arslst the farmer and the
laboring man. I endorse each and
every one of the splendid and numer
ous measures which have been recent
ly enacted to promote and assist agri
culture and to help and dignify labor.
His party proceeds upon the theory
that federal courts are Infallible and
for years, while in power, refused to
abolish government of employes by
Injunction, while my party, upon com
ing Into power, abolished government
by Injunction and provided that all
employes charged with being In con
tempt of a federal court In an equity
proceeding involving labor disputes
should be entitled to a trial by a jury
of his peers. His party regarded hu
man labor as a commodity, while my
party has decreed that the labor of a
human being Is neither a commodity
nor an article of commerce.
He must say why his party refused
to give the people the parcel post
system and always operated the post
office department at a loss, whereas
under dot administration millions of
dollars, of surplus have been turned
back roto the treasury. ' -'
Judge Lamm seems to mistrust the
people. Before and since the primary,
la his speeches throughout the state,
be has denounced the present state
primary law, claiming that It breaks
down the moral stamina of candidates
by giving them enormous temptations
to bid for votes by making all kinds
of promises.
Judge Lamm ought to know, and
probably does know, by this time; that
If there had been no state primary law
he could not have been nominated for
Governor.
But when Judge Lamm submitted
his cause to the voters of 8t Louis
he received 38.350 votes to 10,464 cast
for his principal opponent It waa this
vote that gave him the nomination
a vote that he nerer could have got
ten la a convention.
As for me, I stand for the present
state primary law. I have an abiding
faith in the judgment of the people.
They will not be misled by false prom
ises. They are quick to detect the!
lack of stamina in any candidate. The
people may occasionally make a mis
take, but I hope the day may never
come when the citlxena composing the
political parties In Missouri will be
denied the right to name their own
