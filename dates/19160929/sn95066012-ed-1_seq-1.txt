Publicity Rather Than Rallies.
Some papers have Made sugges

political rallies. We would suggest
that it would be better to collllne the
political speakiue largely to the can
didates for office, if candidate Qra
ham would outline a program and
with other candidates for state Office
go directly to the people with It. thev
could awaken a public sentiment that
would either accept or reject their
proposals. There is some question ill
our mind whether this could be ac
complished better by rallies or by
publicity In the press of the stale. A
rally to be really effective win cost
from $.ri(i to $im and a few hundred
people nt the most reached. Thai
same amount of money spent In the
public press would reach as many
thousands, and many people of the op
por.ltn political persuasion, as hun
dreds reached by a rally. After con
sidcrable experience at political ral
lies we nre convinced that they are
an expensive and rather Ineffective
way (o reach the voters. The stale
has Just seen a trial of publicity that

Work to do in China.
William F. Carey, a former Hoosick
Falls boy, who has ofteu visited
friends in Bennington, and who has
achieved nation-wide fame as one of
the foremost railroad construction
contractors, left lust month for China
to carry out canal and railway con
struction contracts involving in the
neighborhood of 1100,000,000. He will
build 1,500 miles of new railway for
the Chinese government and will also
undertake the reclamation of the
Brand Canal, ."inn miles in length, the
artificial waterway winch connects the
Yang tse river with the Hoang-Ho,
built more than 8,000. years ago.
The letting of these contracts to
Americans is hailed as a turning
point in the history of the. world's fi

were carried out In London, but the
world war has ' hanged things and
China has recently been financing in

have entered upon a work which will

Frankfurter Zeitung's Comment on
Allied Offensive.
Commenting on the Anglo-French
offensive ou the Somme front, the
Frankfurter Zeitung says, according
to a dispatch from Amsterdam, by way
ot London at 4:5;! p. m. yesterday:
"Th6 enemy achieved a tactical
gain. It vvas a terrible day. appalling
ly sanguinary for the assailants, and
it resulted in a most trying situation
for the defendeis. Streams of blood
BOWed and vast quantities of shells
fell upon the German positions north
of the Somme. Again the British and
French hurled a veritable army
against our line. A tactical gain was
the result. In strategy the entente
won nothing. Field Marshal von Hln
denburg has not swerved a hair's
breadth from the calm course he has
laid. The western front experienced
the most severe hour It has yet known
and in it we lost stubbornly-defended
villages and valuable positions, but
as a whole the front remained linn
and it was impossible to break
through."

shot gun nnd three empty shells were
nt his side. The top of the son's
head was blown oiT, and the two other
members of the family had been shot
through the head. The shooting la
supposed to have taken place early
yesterday morning.
The only explanation of the crime
current in Tolland last night was
that the son, Kdward, had shot his
mother and sister in a fit of insanity
and had then killed himself. Last
week, Kllas Gilmore, brother of tho
late RufUS Gilmore, husband of Mrs.
Helen Gilmore; and Miss Lydla Gil
more. about 80, a sister of Edward
Gilmore were taken to tho North
ampton hospital for the. insane. Kd
ward Gilmore was employed at the
factory of the William L Gilbert
clot k company at Wlnsted. Ct., and
went to Toolland a few days ago to
dispose of the stock on the farm and
to bring his mother and sister to live
with him.
The cattle and other stock on the
place were sold Inst Saturday to
Charles Soloes of Now Boston for
1425, In Kdward Gilmore's pocket
yesterda.v was found over $lno. The
Gilmore children were all born In
Tolland, Where Rufus Gilmore died
list spring. Dr. Ward Of New Boston
viewed the bodies. The authorities
of Westfleld were notified of the crime
last evening.
It Is thought that the motive for the
shooting may have been Kdward Gil
more's desire to have his mother and
later move to Wlnsted and their un
wtlllngleia to do so. The son hail re
cently paid a month's rent to Col.
Homo of WInStOd for nn apartment
for himself ami his mother and sister.
Medical Examiner K. s. smith of
West field viewed tho bodies late last
evening and turned them over to
Undertaker Gibbons of OranvUIe. The
mother hud a wound under her right
ear: the daughter was shot through
the left eye. and the entire left side
of tile sou's head vvas shot away.
