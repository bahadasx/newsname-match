Plans to Divide
Morton County
Mandan Now the County Seat
But Many Other Towns
Want It.
Mandan, N. D., Sept. 28.—Man
dan, county seat of Morton, big
gest county in North Dakota with
an area greater than that of the
state of Connecticutt, sits compla
cently by while county division
campaigns are being launched
with great ado, in several dist
ricts.
One scheme of division con
templates the creation of a Grant
county out of the southwest sec
tion of the county, leaving Mor
ton with a territory about the
same size as that which it is pro
posed to take from it.
Another scheme contemplates
the cutting of the county into
lliree new counties—leaving Mor
ton in the northwest.
Still another proposed division
creates the county of Washington
out of the western part of the
present county, leaving Morton
27 townships in the east end of
the county.
County scat aspirations of var
ious interested towns are respon
sible for the multitude of divi
sion schemes.
And if they all go on the bal
lot, chances are that Morton will
remain the same as it is today
wilh Mandan still the county
seat.

FORMER DICKINSON BALL
PLAYER IN BIG LEAGUE,
Dickinson Press: Pitcher
Northrop, who did such valiant
work with the Dickinson base
ball team the past season, is again
back with the Milwaukee team in
Ihe American association, in
which he played before coming
to Dickinson. Upon his return
Ire was immediately put on the
pitcher's slab in a game with To
ledo, which team he held to on
ly four hits. Milwaukee winning
by the score of 6 lo 2.
Northrop proved one of the
best pitchers that the local team
has ever had, and it is with in
terest that his friends in this lo
cality hear that he is back in real
last company again. At the con
clusion of the baseball season in
Dickinson he was engaged by the
Mandan team, Bismarck too' a
fall out of Mandan team, and of
course the pitcher was blamed.
.Northrop was released and jump
ed right back into big baseball.
Misses Margaret and Mary Mc
Carthy left Monday for Valley
City where they will attend the
Normal school. The 1916-191?
term opened Tuesday.
Beach Horses at
Glendive Fair
J. R. Waters returned Friday
from the tour of Montana racc
meetings, where he officiated as
starting judge at Miles City and
Glendive. The Miles City fair
was one of the best they ever
held. The exhibits of Farm Pro
ducts and Live Stock being ex
ceptionally good. The fair at
Glendive broke all previous re
cords for attendance, among the
visitors being a number of Beach
citizens.
The Beach horses showed re
markably well. Dr. MacNabs'
trolter Golvalco, was second in
several hotly contested races and
winning a heat over afield of pa
cers in time much faster than his
present record. Billy Madison's
pacer Jessie Mac and Sheriff
Smiths pacer. Higliwood Boy
were well inside the money in all
of their starts.
J. R. Waters trolter, Syanara,
was second in the free-for-all
rot at Miles City the third
heat of which Hokola won in
2-1031 which set a new record for
trotters in Montana over a half
mile track. In this heat Ilokola
and Syanara went to the half like
a double team in 1-061,-!.
At Glendive Syanara won the
special trotter pace the best
time was the 3rd heat in 2-24 Vj.
When one considers that all of
these horses have been in the
money in every start this year,
it shows that Beach has as good
harness horses as are owned in
the northwest.
BUYS FINE STALLION
Carl Jordan residing four
miles soutlj of town purchased
one of Ihe fine young two year
old Percheon stallions that arc
offered for sale at the livery barn
by the Shekleton Horse Co. of
Lawler, Iowa.
Mr. Jordon is an enterprising
young farmer, and believes that
litis community needs better live
slock. The horse he selected is
a beautiful two-year-old dark
grey regstered Percheon stallion.
Mr. Jordon has given the horse
raisers of this locality an oppor
tunity lo breed to one of the best
chairs, sanitary wash-sland rug,
and they should appreciate his
efforts and patronize him accor
dingly.
