CUT BANK, TETON COUNTY. MONTANA, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1916.
Two Dollars Per Yea
Harvest is Smaller
Than Last Year's
But High Price Will More
Than Make Up For
Smaller Yield
Enough threshing has been
done to date to convince the
grain raisers in this section that
the 1916 crop will not yield as
well as that of 1915, a year of
extraordinary grain yields
yields that in one or two in
stances topped known records.
The crop this year will be a
very good average. Wheat will
average about 25 bushels per
acre and flax about 15. The
recent frost did some damage,
effecting the grade consider
ably. The continually soaring
prices will easily offset the
smaller yield and the croo har
vested here this year will bring
more money, undoubtedly, than
last year's great harvest.
The Marias section is the ban
ner secion this season. Wilbur
Baird's wheat yielded about
40 bushels per acre and a 20 acre
field vielded about 50—of fine
No. 1 wheat. One Ethridge
farme.' realized $500.00 from a
9-acre wheat patch.

The prices today:
Spring Wheat .1.41

Lyon Brothers, west of Shel
dy, are harvestingan ex cellent
crop again this year. It was re
ported to this office that they
had one field of leO acres that

per acre. That is a good crop.

By these Election
"Slickers"
Numerous "slickers" are try
ing to take money from the
unsuspecting by offering to bet
that neither Woodrow Wilson
nor Charles Evans Hughes will
be the next president of the
United States.
Here's the explanation:
March 4, 1917, when President
Wilson's term expires, is a
Sunday. It is contrary to
precedent to have an inaug
uration on Sunday.
By an act of congress dated
Jan. 19, 1886, it is provided that
the secretary of state and other
cabinet officers in order shall
succeed to the presidency in
case both the president and the
vice president are eliminated.
Hence, barring his death or
resignation, Robert Lansing,
now secretary of state, will be
president for 24 hours, begin
ning at noon Sunday.
Mrs. Smith Appointed
At the meeting of the county
commissioners held on Monday
of this week, at which were
present Commissioners Rad
cliffe of Fairfield and Savory
of Dupuyer, the office of county
auditor was declared vacant
on account of the absence from
the state for more than 60 days
of Auditor C. James Smith,
first lieutenant of Co. M., Second
Montana Infantry, now station
ed at Douglas, Arizona. The
commissioners appointed Adel
ine Smith, wife of Lieut. Smith
as the auditor, and she at ose
qualified for the position by
taking the oath of office and
filing her bond. The bond is for
$15,000, and was signed by Thos.
O. Larson, Julius Hirshberg, C.
S. McDonald, G. M. Coffey, P.
H.Crossen and vVm. Hodgskiss
as sureties.—Montanan.
Figures on City Work
The city has just completed
the extension of 1250 feet of
water mains, under direction of
Jens Bakke. City Clerk Van
Demark has been doing a little
figuring since the completion of
this work and finds that it cost
the city 91c per foot, as against
$2.20 when the main system
was installed b y Contractor
Green. The job cost the city
$1037 and if it had been done
by Green it would have cost
$2750. And this saving has
been effected in the face of
higher prices for piping this
year. The city fire hall is now
completed, also, at a cost of
about $1800 and the fire appar
atus will be installed therein at
once.
The W. C. T. U. will hold a
cooked food sale on the afternoou
of Saturday, Sept. 30, and also on
Saturday. Oct. 7. Friends of the
orgauization who wish to help may
send cooked food to Halvorson's
S Lore on these days.
Provisions of The
Prohibition Act
No One Need be Muddled
as Provisions Are
Plain
We have received many
inquiries concerning the pro
hibition law to be voted on by
the people at the general elec
tion to be held November 7.
There seems to be some doubt
relating to the time when this
law will go into effect, but this
will be removed by noting
section 2, which provides that
the law will become effective
after the 31st dav of December,
1918. The law passed by the
legislature to be submitted to
the voters at the election to be
held on November 7, reads as
follows:
Section 1. Ardent spirits, or
any compound thereof capable
of use as a beverage, or ale, beer,
wine or intoxicating liquor or
liquors of any kind shall not. be
manufactured or introduced in
to Montana, except as herein
expressly provided.
Every person who sells, ex
changes, gives, barters or dis
poses of any ardent spirits, or
any compound thereof capable
of use as a beverage, or any ale,
beer, wine or intoxicating liq
uors of any kind, to any person,
persons or association or cor
poration in the state of Mon
tana, or who manufactures, or
introduces into, or attempts to
introduce into the state of Mon
tana, any ardent spirits, or any
compound thereof capable of
use as a beverage, or any ale,
beer, wine or intoxicating liq
uors of any kiud, shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor, and upon
conviction shall be imprisoned
not less than ten days nor more
than two years, and shall be
fined not less than $25 nor more
than $300 for each offense; pro
vided, that nothing in this act
shall apply to the manufacture
or sale of denatured alcohol,
nor to wine intended for sacra
mental purposes, nor to alcohol
intended for scientific or manu
facturing purposes.
Section 2. T h i s act shall
take effect and be in force on
and after the 31st day of Decem
ber, 1918, provided the same
shall be ratified by a majority
vote of the people of the state
of Montana.
Section 3. There shall be a
referendum upon this act and
the secretary of state is hereby
required and it is made his duty
to submit this measure, in ac
cordance with Article V, Sec
tion 1, of the Constitution, at
the biennial regular general
election to be held in Novem
ber, 1916.
Section 4. Separate ballots
shall be used at such general
election to be held in Novem
ber, 1916, which shall have print
ed thereon the words, the first
two of which, in each instance,
shall be printed in capital let
ters, as follows:
"FOR PROHIBITION of the
sale and manufacture of intoxi
cating liquors."
"AGAINST PROHIBITION
of the sale and manufacture of
intoxicating liquors."
Section 5. If a majority of
the votes at said election shall
be in favor of this act, Section
1 thereof shall not be in effect
until the 31st day of December,
1918.
Section 6, All acts and parts
of acts in conflict herewith, par
ticularly all laws of this state
and all ordinances of cities and
towns relating to the issnance
of liquor licenses, are hereby
repealed after the 31st day of
December, 1918, provided this
act is approved by the people.
Approved February 27,1915.
Revision of Rail
Schedule Next
Sunday
There will be a revision of
northern Montana train sched
ules on the Great Northern, be
ginning Sunday, Oct. 1st. The
Great Falls Tribune outlines
the changes that will affect Cut
Bank, as follows:
The local passenger on the
Shelby line will be operated un
der the present schedule to
Shelby, only, and return and no
service will be performed by it
on Sunday between Shelby and
Sweet Grass as is done on week
days for the Lethbridge con
nection.
By operating the main line
local passenger trains to Cut
Bank, instead of Havre, as at
present, connection will be
made at Shelby with the two
local trains on the Shelby line
in and out of Great Falls. It
will also relieve trains 43 and
44 ot' the local work between
Shelby and Cut Bank.
Poorly Advertised
The Choteau Montanaa
voices a complaint indulged in
bv many citizens all over Teton
county, concerning the adver
tising of the recent state land
sale. Few people in the county,
outside the Conrad zone, were
aware of the date of the sale or
the description of the lands or
lots to be sold. The advertising
of the sale appeared exclusively
in the Conrad Independent, of
ficial organ of the democracy
in this county, and as the state
land board is democratic through
and through, no other paper is
recognized. While Brother
Thomas Busey is not at all to be
blamed, rather to be compli
mented for his good fortune in
having all this "fat" handed to
him on a silver salver, it does
seem like pretty "peanutty"
politics on the part of the land
board. A number of lots and
tracts in Cut Bank were offered
for sale (in the Independent)
and scarcely a dozen citizens
were aware of the sale. As a
result there were but three or
four bidders for the Cut Bank
property.
NOTICE
The Cut Bank Democratic Cluh
will meet Wednesday at 8 P. M. in
the Commercial Club room.
The achievements of the Wilson
administration will he discussed by
S. J. Rigney, M. A. O'Neill aud
others. Every member of the club
is earnestly requested to come and
bring a friend. Visitors cordially
welcomed. We will try to interest
you. Marie Bowman , Secy.

it is doubtful if he could secure

Will Organize An
Athletic Assoc'n
Meeting to Be Held Mon
day Evening For
that Purpose
There will be a meeting at
the Pioneer Press office next
Monday evening, the purpose
of which will be the organiza
tion of an athletic club. The
idea was suggested by Principal
Fairbrother and it has met with
hearty rësponse. Prin. Fair
brother suggests the old school
building as thepermanent head
quarters of the club, further
more he suggests that it be in
no way connected with the
school athletics, but an organ
ization of all citizens interested
in sports and pastimes for the
winter season. The Pioneer
Press understands that the old
school building can be rented
for this purpose at a very rea
sonable figure and as it is
equipped with a good lighting
and heating system and is suf
ficiently spacious for all indoor
sports, it will doubtless be se
lected as the meeting place for
the proposed club. All who are
interested in the organization of
a club for physical development
and social diversion should
come to the meeting Monday
evening. Officers wili be chosen
and plans made for equipping
tne club room. It will prove of
incalculable benefit to the young
boys and old boys — and the
girls, young and old, also. So
come to the meeting.
To Subscribers:
The print paper famine con
stantly grows worse. It is now
very difficult for the small pur
chaser to procure material at
any price. There is a big loss
io be faced in the subscription
department. If collections are
not made promptly the loss will
be still greater. We must do
something to meet the situation
and have decided to remove all
delinquent subscribers from our
mailing list at an early date.
This week we removed the
names of a number who failed
to respond to statements. There
is nothing 'personal' in this ac
tion and no favors are to be
granted, the step is taken to
fortify ourselves against meet
ing a still greater loss. Print
paper is 300 per cent higher to
day than eight months ago and
our advices are that it will con
tinue to ascend until the close
of the war and possibly after
that time.
