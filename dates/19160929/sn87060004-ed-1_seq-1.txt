BIRDS RE-,
PORTEOPLENTIFUL
New Game Law Allows Only
Twelve Quail Ki'lcd in
a Day
There enmo nIowitiK reports
from every section no to the
qnull crop. In every neigliiior
hool tlio birds are reported to be
moro plentiful than for yearB
past and the huntors arc lookine
forward to extra pood shooting.
Bnt thov will find the laud
owners moro disposed to keep
indiscriminate hunter" off their
ground nnd permission had hotter
bo secured beforo entering any
field.
Another thing this year which
will have a direct influenco on
the auail shooting is the now law
which limits each hunter's kill to
twolvo birds per day. In times
past it bai often beon nothing
short of wanton slaughter: when
no limit was set huuters wero
allowed to kill all tho birds thoy
could. A ccnuino sportsman
will roligioml adhero to thin
law. for it was passed to safe
guard the quail and prevent them
-from being cleaued out entirely,
and for thoso who wll uot ob
serve tho bag limit it is proposed
tohavo wideawake pamo wardens
who will Ece that they are pros
ecuted if theyiio above tho limit.
Gamo wardens havo tho power to
Eton any hunter at any time and
make him show what ho has in

Well do I mind tlio story, said
Fluucgan. IJalaam was a blshbrow
that knowed less tban his Jackass. Ho
took on ofllco to curso tho people
Tlio Jackass saved them. 'TIs nil la
Numbers Twlnty-two. Ocb bono! 'Tls
i dlffcroat tbeso "times. Tbo Jackass
knew better till Dalaom tamed him.
"Laro mo rldo je," says Balaam, "an
I'll inako yo tbe biggest Ass in the
wurld,"
"drcat," says tbo Assj "what d'yo
feedr'
'Tork," says Balnnm.
"Mo savior," saya tbo Ass.
Bo Italaam mounts. Hut soon tbo
Jack balks.
Threat Is ltV says Balaam.
"Snakes," says tho Ass; "Ut looks
Uko tho Jawbone uv mo mother."
"O'wan," says Balaam, blttln' tbe
Ass a clip, "'tis mo furrcn policy,"
he says.
"Phwat's ut for?" nxes tho Asa.
"TJt dcflnds tbo nasbun," says Ba
laam. "now?" says tbe Ass.
"Foltb," says Balaam, "ut takes &
1 bigger Ass tban you to know that
I t-avo It to Brine," says Balaam to tbo
l Ass; an' tho Jack walks on mcdlta-
tin-.
Hoe, tiaw," says tbo Ass, balkln' an'
klckln'.
"What now?" says Balaam.
"Dlvll a Jackasa crer seen tho like,"
says tho Ass. "Ut could bo a frog,"
says bo, "for ut stands up In front,
an' sits down behind; an' 'tis mos'ly
mouth," says tbo Asa. "Ut has white
feathers," says tbo Jack, "wld yallcr
streaks, that changes," bo says, "to
Very Crooz Tied, or Nlagaray Bluo, an
now they're Carrysall Taller again,"
says bo. "Hlrlns, haro I been drink
In'?" screams tbo Ass to Balaam.
"Saints bo praised," says Balaam.
"Mo Watchful Waltlu' can still change
Its mind," ho says. "G'wan, wbero
glory waits," ho says. "G'wan, In tho
scrvlco ur Mankind." says Balaam to
tbo Ass, touching him up. An' tho
Ass shuffles ahead, wavln' his ears in
admiration.
"Hco-baw! Ilec-hawl" says tbo Jack,
rcarln' up wld his eyes bulgln.
"Phwat's grlppln' ye now?" says Ba.
loam, lnipashunt like.
"I donno," says tho Ass. "Ut looks
like tho Flyln" Dutchman with n So
cialist Crew," ho says.
"'TIs mo Ship Bill," says Balaam.
"Sido step to the right," ho says; "side
step to tbo left," says bo, weltln' him.
"Back up," says Balaam, near wrench,
in' on tbo Jack's Jaw. "Now forward
for tho Merchant Marino an' fifty
mlllyun pork," says Balaam wld a
shower uv blows; an' tbo Ass goes on
thrcmbiia'.
"Wah-beol Wah-bcol Wah-bcel" says
tbe Jack, shyln' so ho near threw bis
rider.
Til learn yo to shy at mo Naval

so ho cud scarce stand. -
"Yo -'"n't Pass ut wldout wcarln'

coarse whisper.
"Yo Ass," says Balaam. "Don't yo

tones uv thunder. So tho poor basto

feebly wagglln' bla cars.
"1 dlnno phwnt ut Is meself," says
Balaam, "but I know pbwat ut's got,"
Balaam says.
"Pbwat?" axes tho poor Ass.
"Flvo huiidthcr thousaud votes," says
Balaam, wld a pious air. "G'wan, yo
big Ass, an' doaut yo nrguo wld on
Idnyllst," says Balaam to tbo Ass.
"Wo can't pass ut In tbo dark," pleads
tbo Ass. "Lavo us wait for light,"
moans tbo Ass, wccpln.
"Nix," says Balaam, "Tbero's a hot

"or porsonal," chants Balaam to tbo
poor Avs tickltn' tho Jack's slats wld a

By this time, tho Ass was so woro
out wld his ardyous labors, that bo

So, wld ouo despalrln' cry, bo dropped
