down two of them within thirty seconds

which shot down two, minutes later.
He was looking ior the iwo-remaining

Von Bethmann-Hollweg Attacks Brit
ish in .Address—President of Reich
stag Less Optimistic and Says War
Is Now at Climax—Chancellor De
dares Allies Will Be Unable to Break
Thru German Lines.
Berlin, Sept. 29.—Germany will per
severe until victory is hers, the rejeh
stag was told yesterday by Chancellor
von Bethmann-Hollweg, according to
the text of his speech, which waa pub
lished today. The chancellor declared
that this year's harvest has made Ger
many's position, much more secure. He
declared Great Britain was breaking
one international law after another,
and declared that country to be Ger
many's most egotistical, flerces^ and
most obstinate enemy.
The chancellor declared his con
tempt for those circulating the reports
that all Germany's means of fighting
were not being employed to the fullest
possible exteht. He addec^that to dis
appoint the enemy, "who Is on watch
for every breach of our Inner determ
ination," he would not give details.
"Today, after two years of fighting,
struggling, suffering and dying," he
continued, "we know more than ever
before that there is only'one watch
word, namely, persevere and win. We
will win. Last winter there" was fear
as to whether our foodstuffs would suf
fice. This year's harvest makes us
much more secure than was the cafe
last year."
Admits War at Climax.
The following account of today's
session of the relchstag was given out
.by the Overseas News Agency:
"The relchstag opened, this after
noon. President Kaempf, in his intro
ductory speech, stated that the war,
in its economic and political as well
bM military aspects, had now reached
a climax. On all fronts there was now
a violent struggle .for supremacy.
"He mentioned the arrival of the
merchant submarines Deutschland -ano
Bremen Jn the United States. [A new*
dispatch .to Bettln tWJt a Uig had gone
out from New Londottj Conn., to meet
the Bremen, fed to an erroneous report
that the Bremen had reached Amer
ica-]
"The president read telegrams from
the emperors exchanged on the begin
ning of ihe second year of .the war and
with the president of the Hungarian
parliament at the time of the fall of
the Roumania fortress Tu'rtukal. The
:peech was applauded."
General von Wandel, deputy minister
for war, has been dismissed from the
war ministry, according £o\an official
statement given. out by th\ German
government today.
The chancellor began by outlining
the events yhich led up to the Italian
and Roumanian declarations of war.
He recalled that the German ambassa
dor had left home aft,er Italy's decla
ration of war against Austria-Hungary
and that Germany had announced that
the Italians would find German troops
fightings with their Austro-Hungarlan
comrades on the Italian frontier.
8tate of War Long Existed.
"Thus a state of war practically ex
isted," He continued, "but a formal dec
laration of war did not come till later.
Italy apparently was afraid of the fate
of the. usual consequences which It
would suffer after the war in regard to
her economics relations with us.
"On the other* hand, Rome preferred
to lay the blame for the declaration at
our door. But for us there was no rea
son to play Italy's game. Our tactics
were justified by the Interrupted ef
forts of the entente powers to cause
Italy to declare war.
"For more than a year the Italian
government resisted. Finally'the meas
ures which England employs with
equal ruthlessness against neutrals
ariS her a!!!e« were too strong. Italy*
warfare depends upon English coal
and English money. Finally she had
to give in.
Charges Britain Coerced Italy.
"The decision certainly was brought
about by British coercion, altho Ital
lan hopes.in regard to the Balkans
also exercised influence. Italy, as is
known, d«£"ires Balkan territories which
are within the natural sphere of Greek
Interests.
"In order not to be abandoned Italy
found it necessary to partake in the
expedition of General Sarrall (the al
lied commander at Salonlki) and this
caused an encounter between Italian
and German troops ^in Macedonia.'/.
Says Allies Can't Get. Thru.
London, Sept. 29.—The allies cyi not
break thru the German llpes on the
Somme, Chancellor von Bethmann
Hollweg told the relchstag, according
to reports of a speech yesterday.
"The English and French, it Is true,"
he said, "haVe achieved advantages.
Our first lines have been pressed back
and we have also to deplore heavy
losses in men and material. That was
Inevitable in an offensive on such, a
mighty scale. But what -our enemies
hoped to accomplish, that is, tb break
thru and roll up our line, has not been
attained. Still another trench and An
other village may be lost, but they
will not get thru." ,, -5

Binghomton, N. Y., Sept. 29.—
Charles E. Hughes motqred over muddy
streets, thru the first rain storm he
has fexperienced since he began his

the opera house here today.
It had been arranged to have h'.m
speak at railway stations but at the

local speakers so that Mr. Hughes
might conserve his voice.
In his speech here he said:
"It Is no time to be talking of a
tariff for revenue only. We need pro

is no man who can tell you where the
democratic party stands in regard to
protection of American interests.
"It takes all of us, too, to make the
United States and make it prosperous,
and we will never do it unless labor
and capital agree."
He declared he would like to see an

squarely for investigation before legis

to labor or capital on that principle."

"About the, extent and character of

"For foyr years as executive of a great

'In my state there are today more

HARDING WILL NOT WITHDRAW
of Ex-
Makes Answer to Demands
Speaker Stillman.
Des Moines, Sept. 29.—In reply to
the demand of Ex-Speaker Stillman
that he withdraw from the guberna
torial race Mr. Harding over the long
distan.ee telephone from Stanwood dic
tated this statement to The Capital:
"The only answer to that sort of an
editorial is that in a regular primary In
which all of the candidates presented
their cause to all of the republicans of
the state with four candidates In the
field, I received almost as many votes
as the other three candidates. The
three candidates were all good men. Wc
had a fair primary. The weaknesses
and strong points of the various can
didates were presented.
My answer to Mr. Stillman is that
I will win in November from 75,000 to
100,000 majority. I am a poor man. I
hn.vp. riot nhle to conduct n. per
sonal campaign. The republican state
central committee is just now begin
ning to campaign. That is due to the
fact that they believed in the'intelli
gence of the Iowa voter.
"The state candidates and congress
ional candidates on the republican
ticket will have their first meeting Sat
urday. Up to this time a campaign of
mudslinging and vllllflcation has been
carled on by my personal energies.
They have not made a single dent in
the republican line-up of the state.
What Mr. Stillman ought to do is to
join with the republican state central
committee and the whole republican
ticket for victory In November.
I' Will- not withdraw, and Mr. Still
man's opposition will cut very little
figure in the result in November."
