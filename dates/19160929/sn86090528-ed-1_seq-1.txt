Fashion and Show Week, Dollar Day and
Best of All Carnivals Will Be
Widely Advertised
TWELVE BIG TENTS;
TWO FREE SHOWS
A Whole Lot for the Round Dollar and
Fashion Display With Live
Models Among Items -
A discussion of unusual interest was
precipitated at the regular session of
the city council last night when B. F.
Morgan, on behalf of the Commercial
and Farm Bureau, asked the council
to remit the $50 daily license for a' big
carnival company which, under the au
spices of the bureau, wculd soon come
to Chickasha for a week's engagement.
He stated that under a contract al
ready entered into with the Great Pat
terson Shows the Commercial and
Farm, Bureau expected to receive be
tween (GOO and $700 as its share, i"--resenting
15 per cent of the gross
ceeds. The bureau, as all know, is a
great asset to the community, but in
endeavoring to advance the interests
of Chickasha and Grady county it had
acquired a balance of about $460 on
the debit side of the ledger. With the
pro. ;is expected to accuro from this
show and carnival week in Chickasha
as the result of bringing to the com
munity a good and clean attraction the
.bureau would be lifted out of debt and
would have funds with which to oper
ate. He therefore asked the city coun
cil to remit the raily license tax of
$50 in order that greater profits might
accrue to the bureau, which otherwise
would xmc to bear the burden of the
license which would reduce its profits
to about $200, '
In the beginning the council seemed
not disposed to consider the matter se
riously, but as Mr. Korj.n went mare
directly into the question the interest
of the members was aroused and with
a single exception no dissension was
expressed. The single opponent was
Councilman Linn, who expressed him
self as being opposed to offering any
concession whatever to carnivals, of
any kind, declaring that he should pre-
fer to tax the carnival and to then re
turn the $50 a day to the Commercial
and Farm Bureau. He cited instances
v'berein carnival managements have
oi kept faith with local beneficiaries,
had withheld from them commissions
on their most lucrative attractions.
The fireboys, for instance, had brought
carnival attractions to this city on two
occasions when they were firmly con
vinced that they would place several
hundred dollars in their treasury.
Smooth work on the part of the carni
val officers, however, showed the boys
that the profits in the show business
were really very small and he had lost
confidence in their promises.
Mr. Linn also stated that notwith
standing the contract which they had
entered into with the bureau and
which he had not seen, he was quite
sure that it contained a joker and that
the local organization would find that
certain parts of the proceeds would
stick to the bell rope by virtue of omis
sion of mention of some of their best
paying tents.
This aroused Mr. Morgan to the ex
tent that he offered to donate to Coun
cilman Linn a $30 suit of clothes If
the carnival people got away with a
single penny that shoJld justly come
to the bureau under the terms of the
contract. Every money making devise,
even to the baby dolls, came within
the province of the bureau's revenue
and if the bureau did not make money
out of the transaction it would be be
cause the people of this section did
not know and patronize a good show
when they saw one. Furthermore, he
said the management had guaranteed
the bureau a profit of $100 under all
conditions.
Mayor Coffman and others backed
Mr. Morgan in his contentions, and
proffered proof that the coming carni-l
val was In fact a big and a good show i
and it was unanimously voted that the
license for the we;k be remitted. '
The week beginning October
promises to be an active one in busi-j
ness circles in Chltkasha when onej
of the greatest carnival show s in thr ;
loiitury will spend a week here 1
the merchants will put on sales tha
will bring people in for many mile
around to take advantage of. Fash
ion Week, probably with living mod
els, Sales Week and a Dollar Day are
among the features which will be
inutru up tiuu uieso win u given spe-)
cial attention at the regular meetini;
of the Retail Merchants assoclat on
which will be held on October 3. Dol
lar Day has become a great institution
in many sections and once put on they
find such general favor that there is
usually a clamor among farmers and
economical housewives for repeat
dates. Fashion Week will attract men,
women and children not only from the
outside but from the city as well, a
concerted move to show all new styles
at a certRin time being of great con
venience to the public.
As for the Great Patterson Shows
there are none better in the country,
It is said by those who appear to
know. They have filled engagements
at the state fair in Oklahoma City and
other large places and the advance
agent assures the local business men
that it will be a show with no regrets.
Twelve big attractions, minor ones
"d two free shows will entertain the
from far and near.
'"carnival at-
which has c.
in Oklahoma City, has a
and corps of trained animals including
five elephants, from twelve to fifteen
lions. The big show employs 200 peo
ple only forty of whom are boarded by
the company, leaving 160 to spend
their money at boarding and rooming
houses.
The arrangements provide ot
Chickasha avenue -v kept c ear of
all obstructions. Tha tenta win be ac
commodated on the vacant lot In the
vicinity of Kansas avenue I tween
Fifth and Sixth streets.
The carnival ana Fashion Week will
be advertised in all small towns within
a radius of twenty miles of Chickasha
and the committee, which consists of
Mayor O. Coffman, B. F. Morgan and
J. W. Kayser, believe that between
3000 and 4000 people will be drawn to
Chickasha during the week.

Disposed io Cling to $20,000 in Paving
Tax Penslties Until Convinced of
Right Course
EFFORT TO FORCE
ACTION IS BLOCKED
Resolution Offered by Paving Taxpay
Attorney to Take Official Stand is
Filed for Future Reference
An unsuccessful effort was n:ade by
Adrian Melton, on behalf of a number
of paving taxpayers, to induce the city
council, at Its regular meetliiR last
night, to puss a resolution similar to
Uiat which was adopted by the city
council at El Reno, disposing officially
of the 7 per cent excess payments w ith
which delinquent taxpayers have been
penalized since the payments of the
grading and pa !;-.;; taxes became due.
This amount, about (20,000, is no'v be
ing held by the city treasurer again it
emergencies which might arise where
in. a Treasure Clark stated last night,
the city might be called upon to make
good any delinquencies.
Mr. Melton, bearing the diaft of a
resolution which was identical with
that upon which the EI Reno council
took notion, explained that the city of
Chickasha would bo taking no risk iu
its adoption, ' which would force the
bondholders to take definite action In
the matter, and thus bring a show dov n '
and the consequent disposition of tl.e
excess payments now held by the city.
Following the adoption of this resolu
tion, in Mr. Melton's opinion, the bond
holders would at once Institute Injunc
tion proceedings and the matter wrutd
be decided, as was the case at El Reno,
in favor (if the city and paving taxnay.
an. The taxpayers, he was assured,
would defend the cause and thus re
lieve the city of any expense in tln
premises.
Mr. Melton had aid he would like
to have the matter disposed of before
other matters were taken up by the
council, as he had, at that moment, a
case pending iu the night session of
the county court and was obliged to
hasten to that tribunal.
Mayor Suggest Caution.
Mayor Coffman was not disposed to
act with haste in the matter. He aid
the money was safely in the hands of
the city at present and he was willing
to let well enough alone. He was
quite certain that thvi bondholders
would, under present conditions in
stitute no legal ac tion to force the pay
ment to them of the $20,000 nov; in
the hands of the treasurer.
Chickasha't Responsibility.
An argument was then precipitated
between City Treasurer Clark and Mr.
Melton as to the responsibility of the
City of Chickasha in the matter. Treas
urer Clark, being under a (20,000 bond
to give proper account of all moneys
coming into his keeping, was asked to
give his opinion, whic h he did vUho.it
'lesitalion, declaring it to be hs inten
tion to hold the eight per cent excess,
which included the city's commis
sion or the collection of the funds, as
it was his opinion that In the end tho
ci'y would be held liable for all delin
quencies on the bonds. Mr. Melton
took issue with the city treasurer and
declared that iu no sense could this
municipality be held for such payment.
Like Sherlock, however. Mr. Clark re
iterated that it was so stated In the
bond and upon Mr. Melton doubting
that suc h could he the cases the city
treasurer asked to be excused untii In
could bring a copy of the bond from
his offic e. The motion of Councilman
Hjyes that the resolution be filed for
further consideration having been
passed, howevei. Mr. Melton, in re
sponse to a call from the county court,
did not wait for Mr. Claiks' return
with the bond and the matter was
dropped for the present, the city cle'-k
p'a'ing the resolution on file.
The resolution provides in part that,
whereas such penalties having attach
ed to such spec ial assessments, a mrcat
burden and hardships has fallen' .m Bm
the people by reason thereof, and such
penalties, not being necessary for the
use of said city, the law under which
the same were &sessed Hot providing
for any disposition of said IS per cent
