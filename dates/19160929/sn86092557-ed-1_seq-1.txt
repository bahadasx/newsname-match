Lieutenant Georges Guynermer. Incidentally
Lieut. Guynemer, who is
known as "King ot the AceB" fell 10,000

Guynemer went to the assistance of
a comrade who was* hard pressed by
five German machines. He brought
down two of them within 30 seconds
: and then, rising, overtook a third
; which he shot down two minutes later.
He was looking for the remaining
two German machines when a
shell burst beneath him and stripped
' the left wing of his aeroplane of ev|

giddily earthward.

MM HIB_
Some Facts Gleaned From t
the States Finance;
Cornwell's Prepc
i ????(Special
to The West Virginian.)
CHAR1ESTON. W. Va., Sept. 2J.?
John J. Cornwell, In his frantic attempts
to get 12,000 Republican
votes, has blundered into the same
old story that the people of West Virginia
are paying three times as much
in salaries for their state officers as
they did when Democrats controlled
the state. But he is careful to say
nothing about what went into the
pockets of certain Democrats in the
way of fees in those old days, which,
had he at t-.ny time attempted to explain
away, would have only Invited
disaster. Unfortunately for Cornwell,
the State of West Virginia publishes
now under Republican administration,
a complete audit of its
financial affairs every year.
The comparison between the distribution
of taxation for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1916, and that
iu 1897, the last year the Democrats
had control of the financial affairs of
the state, is possibly the strongest
recommendation for every nominee
on the Republican ticket this year,
trom Covernor down, because the flguies
show that corporations escaped
taxation almost entirely under Democratic
rule, while the plain people
bore the whole burden of tne state's
government, when the small property
holders paid not only their part of
the state taxes, but also paid most of
the taxes of those whom, Cornwell
are now paying many times the
sum they did under the Democratic
regime.
The total amount paid for salaries
of state officers in 1916, is $26,450,
and it is true that in 1897 this
amount was only marked up as
$8,700, or about one-third as much.
But the kernel In the nut whteh Mr.
Cornwell prefers not to pick out of
the shell is this: The Democrats had
a fee system which was enriching
them, while these fees did not Bhow
up In the reports, because they went
into the pockets of the happy individuals
the Democrats had fleeted.
