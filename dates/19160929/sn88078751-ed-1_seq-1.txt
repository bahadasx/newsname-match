ment Toward Loans'
Several Cities Present Ilieir Claifiis
For Location 01 Bank
Columbus, SopU. 28. The federal
farm loan board, with' Secrotary' (o?-,
Uio Treasury William O. McAdoo at
its head, left for Washington 'aftGr;
epondlng live hours hero, duying whlclr
tiioy heard the claims o(' Cincinnati
Columbus, Toledo' and,' Canton -'as'i a,
6ite for 01. e of Uio farm ,lo'ait ba'uk,-
together w.th the views of. a. number'
of agHcult-irists on the needs and
possibilities of such a bank.,
The board took with it voluminous
briefs sub. tuntlatlng all the clalnA,
made before It. One of the briefs was
from Canton, which had no speakers
here. Mr. McAdoo said before leaving
that all th f so will receive the most
careful attention by the board at its
meetings h; Washington.
While lhi members of the board
gave courteous attention to all the
claims put forth by rival cities, it be
came apparent that they wore more
concerned In finding the sentiment of
the rural constituency with reference
to loans than In learning of the merits
of the several cities that want a bank
located in their limits.
A number of farmers, theoretical
and practical, were called to the Hart
man stage. Their testimony estab
lished the fnft that a bank, such as is
proposed, would meet a need, under
certain conditions would be welcomed
nnd in general would conduce to the
rehabilitation of the rural districts,
put agriculture on a business basis
and keep young peoplo on the far'mB
or encourage those who had left them

tariff. To an audience of thousands
of workmen at tho Homestead steel
plant, ho declared that present condi
tions of prosperity would not endure
to the davs when Europe would he at
peace, unless the United States should
adopt a protective tariff. To au audi
ence that jammed the music hall he
repeated this statement. He also dwelt
at length upon his views on the Adam
son bill, the administration's policy
toward Mexico, the shipping bill, nnd
What he termed extravagant claims
made by the administration for hav
log aided business.

miloB over dusty roods through the
heart of tho steel making district.

PREPARED
FOR ACJNI
And Stormiest Session In
History Is Predicted
German Reichstag Reassembles
Today at Berlin.
CHANCELLOR TO BE ATTACKED
Advocates of Drastic Submarine and
Zeppelin Warfare and Critics of
Food and Cencorshlp Regulations
All Prepared For Action Socialist
Members Also Expected to Go After
the Government.
Berlin. Sept. 28. With advocates
Of drastic submarine and Zeppella
warfare, critics of the food and cen
sorship rofiiilatlons, and those who
Urge a coalition ministry, all prepared
(or action, the German relchstag re
ssemblel today for what will -probably
bo the stormiest session of its
history.
Backed by Field Marshal Von Hlu
denburp and the kaiser, the opinion
of a majority seerns to be that Im
perial Chancellor Von Bethmann-Holl
weg will weather the storm and con
tinue in power with, the government
almost unaltered.
Hard words for tho United States,
are expected from the submarine ad
vocates, the so-called Tirpitzites, who
scoff at American protests agaiust
British sea regulations as Insincere.
The Socialists, who have supported
t7ie chancellor In 'THY submarine dis
pute, are being asked by some of their
leaders to forget factional differences
and present a solid front in view of
the critical sta?e of affairs.
The case of Dr. Karl TJebknecht,.
the Socialist leader, whose punish
ment for attempted treason and re
sistance to the military authorities
and the police has been increased to
fotir years and one month in state
prison, will in all probability cause
much' trouble.
Dr. Coerting. an industrial leader
from Hanover, will move a vote ot no
confidence In Chancellor Von Beth-mann-Holhve?.
Coertfng represents
one of the party groups waging war
on the chancellor.
