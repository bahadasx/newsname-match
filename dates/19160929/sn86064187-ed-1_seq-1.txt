I states. Mrs. Tucker specializes in lec
lures to school children anil in visits
to lartn homes 111 localities in which
instruction in hygiene, and sanitation
is most needed.
Loss of One Billion.
"Do ou know that the economic littf
ociastuiied by malaria and typhoid
each year 111 the l'nited States amounts
to the staggering sum of $KKX)(KX)..
1100?" she asked her hearers. "And del
you know that Oklahoma eotitribatet
far more than its share of that amount
to tHs shameful waste? '
"Why, with a billion dollars thai
United States could eitiip the largest
amy and navy the world has even seen
and still have enough left to give every
ctiiid in .America a college education.
We howl about the extravagance o!
I die national and state governments; yet
j we, the people, who throisjli our own
sloth and slackness permit these Condi
Hons to exist are guilty of far greater
wastefulness than the - government ol
the most profligate nation the world
has ever known.
Causa of Conditions.
"Insanitary conditions which permit
die existenir of the mosquito and fly
aie the direct cause of both typhoid;
and malaiia. The people of the L'llitCti
Slates have risen 111 their wrath and
demanded the abolition of hog cholera,

iliseaes of animals. As a result, ths
department of agriculture spends hun
ilrrds of thousands uf, dollars annual

tempts to wipe out these diseases.
"We dip our cattle and rradicatt

man appeared before the California
legislatute with a demand for an ap

sixty dais he was given $25,0110.
Simultaneously, a disease broke out

sanitation Wry few have been
equipped with plumb, ng and on the

In many instances, she says, screens
