FRAME BUILDING SLASHED '
BY FALL OF BRICK WALL
Collapse of Brick Wall of New Calla
way Building Crushed Two Build
ings. Wm. Noble Caught in
Wreckage, Badly Injured
MARRIAGE OF TROY BECKETT i
AND MISS MILDRED HENBEST '.
The high wind in the storm of Wed
nesday afternoon caused the brick wall
on the east side of the new Callaway
building to collapse. The little frame
building, next to it was completely de
molished and Wm. Noble, who had his
tailor shop there, was buried in the
wreckage and badly injured.
The building next to it had the roof
caved in and J. E. Jenkins, the jew
eler, lhad a narrow escape .
As soon as the accident happened
men were busy tearing away the fall
en brick to rescue Mr. Noble. He was
completely covered and was found in
a crouching position and unconscious.
He was carried to Dr. West's hospital
there he soon regained consciousness
and told them that there was no one
in the wreckage, so the workers ceas
ed their frantic work. It was thought
at first that there were three other
men than Mr. Noble in the building.
In the next building Mr. Jenkins
had been seated at his work table in
the front. Becoming cold he. decided to
go to the rear of the building after his
coat. He first went to- the front door
to close it and as he turned to go back,
the wall fell and the brick came tum
bling down three steps from where he
stood . It was a narrow escape for
Mr. Jenkins.
Mr. Noble's injuries will probably
not result fatally. His chest was
caved in and his ribs were tore loose,
this was the worst of his injuries.
He has severe cuts on his head and
bad bruises all over his xbody. He
rested well Wednesday night and so
far is doing nicely.
The accident was caused by the high
wind which blew during the hard rain
of Wednesday afternoon. The wall had
just been built and the mortar was
soft. A portion of brick probably six
teen by six feet fell.
In - the rear of Mi". .NoWe'sf shop
Horace Jordan kept his stock of Stan
dard sewing machines .He owned the
machines himself and the loss will fall
on him. It is not known what he will
lose. Some of the machines will be a
total loss, while some may be repaired
so they can be used. Mr. Jordan was
in Neosho at the time of the accident.
J .E. Jenkins had a number of val
uable tools in his jewelry repair shop,
which will be somewhat damaged. His
regulator stopped at 5:03 o'clock,
Avhich was the time of the collapse of
the wall. In the rear of his building
the Singer Sewing Machine Company
Troy Beckett, of Miami, Ok., and
Miss Mildred Henbest, were married, ;
Sunday afternoon, September 24.
Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Henbest, who !
live southeast of Monett, gave a re
ception to the immediate relatives of i
the Beckett and Henbest families Sun
day noon, in celebration of the ap
proaching marriage of their daughter
Mildred to Troy Beckett. After serv
