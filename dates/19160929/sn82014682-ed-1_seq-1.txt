San Francisco Promises Support
" That the San Francisco local of the

port the Honolulu local, No. 3S-26, of
the International Longshoremen's
Association, is stated in f the reply
which Jack Edwardson, business agent
of the sailors' union and a member
of the longshoremen's union commit
tee, claims to liave received today
from the San Francisco organization.
At 12:45 this afternoon Edwardson
announced to the Star-Buletln ' that
luch news had been received,, but he
made it clear that while it means the
San Francisco union will declare
cargoes loaded ( on steamers here by
non-union tebor unfair on their ar
rival at that port If the Honolulu local
requests it, that the local here has not
yet made such a request
No Request Made eYt
' ."Whether we ask the San Francisco
union to declare such cargoes unfair
depends on the arbitration meeting
tomorrow morning," said Edwardson.
"Our side of the situation will be pre
tested from 9 to 10 o'clock,1 and the
employers will have their inning after
that hour. The reply we received to
day means the San Francisco Rig
f ers and Stevedores Union of the Pacific-Coast

are with us end will declare cargoes
loaded here by non-union labor unfalt
if we ask them, which we have not yet
done." ; , . ; .'":." v

Edwardson said that the union was
ready 12 days ago to submit the ques

"nothing to arbitrate." He added that

But Thinksr Strikers Should
iHave f.I ado" Their Demands.
;JB;fcrdAValkinoOut
'I regard : the ' action of the. steve
dores in baring struck for higher pay
without having made, any demand for
an Increase as being indefensible." de
clares Circuit Judge Clarence W. Ash-
lord, in - a statement given .the Star
Bulletin today relative to conditions
cn the waterfront ,-.
"They should return to work at the
old rates,', he continues, "and then
make their demands, thus giving the
shipping Interests a fair opportunity
to meet or to reject those demands.
"Regarding the rate of pay which
prevailed ' before the strike, I am in
formed it was only 29 cents an hour,
thus calling for a 10-hour working day
in which to earn $2. I regard this rate
of pay as being absurdly almost wick
edly inadequate for the character of
labor performed by the stevedores.
Favors Wage Increased
An increase of 50 per cent in this
rate would fall considerably short of
an unreasonable figure. There Is prob
ably no class of labor in these Islands
so severe as that of stevedores and
they should be liberally paid.
"As regards the effort of the union
to enforce the principle of the 'closed
shop,' It is as wrong as possible both
morally and economically. It is into!
erable that any class or number of
men having banded themselves to
gether In a "union should, merely by
virtue of that banding together, -. be
permitted to dictate by whom avail
able labor shall be performed or to
decree that none but union members
shall be employed. ; . , ;
- "We In Hawaii should stamp out
that heresy at the threshold. Any in
terference with so-called strike-breakers
in the performance of their work
or in going to or from their labor
should be promptly squelched and ade
quately punished.
"We Burely do not wish to Import
coast labor conditions into Hawaii
There is no sanctity and should be no
monopoly attaching to membership in
a labor union. Let the strikers re
frain from work if they see fit that
is their privilege. But let them also
refrain from . interference with men
who are willing to work." Such inter
ference Is a serious moral and legal
offense." ;

OF JAPAN ON NATION
Movement is Inaugurated on
August 29 and Has Grown
Steadily Since
In response to a plea made through
the Korean National Association in an
editorial printed in the Korean Na
tional Herald on August 29, represen
tatives of the race In Hawaii are sub
scribing daily to a cause : which the
editor today , stated as - "a fight for
the Independence of , Korea from Ja
pan." "Since the day the editorial ap
peared :n the local paper approximate
ly 15000 has been subscribed.
Money is still coming in, it was stat
ed today at headquarters of the Kore
an National Association by Young M.
Park, the man who wrote the editorial
plea, and so deeply has the subject of
their independence from Japan struck
home that practically every. Korean in
the territory, has Tgiven to the cause.
Even little children have: brought to
the headquarters or sent In by , mail
from other islands contributions from
10 cents to 25 cents. V
All Classes' Contribute vJv i r
Many of. the subscriptions are giv

that Japan, assumed . control olthe
country, laborers and businessmen
drawing from their entire earnings -on
August 29 of each year to subscribe to
the cause.-. ' . :-v ;:
August 29, 1910, was the. date of an
nexation, and Is chosen therefore as
the date to be set aside for swelling
the aubscriptioa fund. . c , ;
' Officials today at the Japanese con
sulate deAied ft rumor. that. Consul

statinghat- th consiir has" JuiU re
turned from Kauai and knows noth
ing about the. matter. Inquiries, made
at the ltorean headquarters by vari
ous Japanese probably gave founda
tion ti the report that the consulate is
looking Jhto the matter. '
pfedaes' Also Given r
Mr. : Park ; told the Star-Bulletin to-
day that every Korean laborer upon
Hawaii's plantations has not pnly sub-,
scribed to the cause but has pledged
himself to support the fund "until the
actual break shall come." Park says
this break means the revolt of Korea
against Japanese oppression.
Various Issues 'of ."the Korean ' Na
tional Herald alnce the printing of the
campaign call' Lave published the list
of names of subscribers, together with
the sums given and the residence of
the giver. The donation is still going
on.; ' ' '.';.: :..':'. V''"::';':;' '
Influential Koreans on the 'Ameri
can mainland, hearing of the call is
sued by the local paper, have likewise
sent in subscriptions in accordance
with their ; means, most of . them
amounting to $12 each $2 a year for
the six years since 1910. - - v
Young M. Park is a graduate of the
University, of Nebraska, , a1 member
of the class of 1912. He gave a state
ment today regarding the main points
of-his" editorial, as follows;
Works For Own People ' '
"Since we came here 13 years ago,"
it said, "we have worked for our own
people as much as was possible, but
chiefly along educational and religious
lines,-and the general welfare of our
race. ' - - - . ..' r ''-' ' ': " ;'
"But all the work we have done is
only in direct preparation ; ; to our
cause our independence from Japan.
We have spent about 125,600 in reli
gious and educational work but not
one cent have we ever saved directly
for the struggle for Independence,
Now we must do something for the
direct cause of preparation. -
"Let us subscribe the earnings of
one day each year August 29, ' the
day. our oppression began for this
just cause."
Appeal Termed Masterpiece
Park's appeal to his people was a
masterpiece, according to those who
translate the language, and had its
desired effect almost before the . ink
upon It was dry.
"Since the article appeared," he said
today, '.'every Korean in the territory
has been moved to follow the idea and
send In money inaccordance with his
earnings for that day. Most of the
people have paid back : for the six
veara while others have decided to
give 50c to $1 each month in the year.
We have 5000 Koreans in, the islands
and the sum thus far Is approximate
ly $5000. r:- -Japanese
Consulate Inquires?
"I have heard that the Japanese con
sulate Is making inquiry about the
work but I do not know, if this Is
true," Park said In reply to Inquiry on
this point. "I do know that several
Japanese have come to see our men
about It. I should like to deny ; the
report, however, that W. K. Ann,, one
of our leading . merchants, who sails
for the Orient today, Is going in this
cause. He is going only on his own
business .and the business of the Pan
Pacific exposition.

Stevedores Declare Their Com
pensation Too Small, at
Living Expense . ,
..V; ' &'-'
' The side of the strikmg stevedores
is fully set forth in a letter written
and delivered to Mayor Lace late yes
terday, signed iby MoseSr K. Kahue,
secretary- and treasurer il the local
union. ' The letter says:
f'Ref erring to our recent letter to
you requesting your good offices as
mayor in. seeking to secure for us a
conference with certain firms In
Honolulu employing stevedores, we
note with regret that you were unable
to hare any of the firms discuss exist
ing difficulties. We appreciate, how?
ever, your efforts In this behalf and
hereby tender ' our sincere thanks
therefor. We believe our claims for
an advance in wages to be absolutely
just and likewise believe the public
generally will recognise them as fair.
To begin with, the work of a steve
dore is not continuous. He; may earn
$10 this week and little or nothing
next week.V One of the facts always
dwelt upon - by the plantations when
claim is made that- plantation labor
ers are underpaid, Is that they are at
work all the year round, which Is not
true of agricultural ; laborers . on the
mainland. While we are supposed to
be always subject to" call, yet we are
paid for only the hours when our em
ployers need us. - 'K: '
UORH2 .;
"Again referring to plantation la
borers, attention has always been di
rected to the fact that they receive
house rent, fuel, medical attention and
other things free. We Teceive none
of these.
. ."The work of a stevedore is hard,
and at times dangerous.. It is cer
tainly more strenuous than that or
field laborers or laborers on county
roads. ' : .
"It seems to us that our compensa
tion Is pitifully smalL We receive 20
cents per hour. For all over eight
hours we are paid at the rate of 40
cents per hour. Certainly neither
rate Is enough for the hard work done
by us. It is less than half of that
received for similar work on the main
land, and less than that paid for any
other labor of equal requirements in
HawaiL ;; ' -' . ,
"If times were hard with pur em
ployers; if dividends had to be passed,
and etenses curtailed, perhaps it
might be said that our claims were
unjust. But the contrary is true. The
firm of McCabe, Hamilton & Renny,
with a capitalization of 950,000, de
pends for its earnings solely on steve
doring, and whatever sums it is able
to pay its stockholders come solely
from thef rults of our labor. ' Just
what that firm is paying now. In the
way of dividends we cannot exactly
say, but believe that it aggregated1
last year not less than 30 per cent.
Surely, It is "not presumptuous, nor ex
travagant for es tc ask that 'part of
this sum be paid us, who really earn
" 'Continued m pare two)
sul has Inquired, of one of our own sec
retaries in this regard," Park contin
ued, "and I have heard it is reported
in the consulate that Ann's trip is is
