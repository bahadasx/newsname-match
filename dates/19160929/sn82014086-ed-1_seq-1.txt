ARE TAKING A REST
But the British and French Artillery Are Hurling Tons
of Steel Against New German Positions
PREPARING ATTACK ON
A Big Battle is in Progress on the Eastern Front in the Region
Between Lutsk and Vladimimir Volynski, Where the
Teutons Are Impeding Progress of Russians by Heavy
Counter Attacks In Transylvania the Teutonic Allies
and the Rumanians Are Engaged in Bitter Fighting With
No Important Results On the Macedonian Front Paris
Reports the Repulse of Bulgarian Attacks on Both Sides
of Fiorina.
Except for a fresh attack by the j
British, which gave them the greater
part of a German redouot north ot
Thiepval and 600 prisoners, t'he troops
of the entente allies In the region bet-ween
the Somme and Ancre rivers in
France apparently are taking- a breath
ing: spell and consolidating ; positions
captured In the gTeut offensive which"
began last Monday and has already
netted them CoraWes, Thiepval and
other strong German positions at vari
ous points along the 20 -mile front.
During the work of consolidating,
however, the British and French artil
lery is hurling tons of steel against
the new positions the Germans have
taken up, doubtless preparatory to an
other freeh attack with Bapaume and
Feronne the ultimate objectives.
Meanwhile a big battle is in progress
en the eastern front in the region be
tween Lutsk and Vladimir Volynski,
around Sviriusky and Kcrynlta,
where the Russians are attempting to
advor.ee, but the Teutons are impeding
them by heavy counter-attacks. The
German war office says these counter
attacks in the region of Korynitza
have resulted in the recapture of po
sitions lost recently by the Teutons
and that the allied forces have now
passed on beyond tfcem. Heavy cas
ualties were inflicted on the Russians,
says Reriin, and in addition 41 officers
and 2,S00 men were made prisoner and
one cannon and 17 machine guns were
captured.
In Galicia the Germans west of
Krasnolesie also pushed forward their
lines, while in the Carpathians attacks
BATTLESHIPS EQUIPPED
WITH 18-INCH GUNS
Are Now Building in Great Britain
Three Inches Bigger Than Any Now
Afloat.
Washington, Sept. 28. Battleships
equipped with 18 -inch guns, three
inches bigger than any now afloat and
two inches greater than the largest
guns projected ofr the new battleships
and battle cruisers to be added to the
America nnavy ,are under construction
in Great Britain, according to unof
ficial advices which are given credence
by nava lofBcials here.
The big weapons are designed pri
marily, officials believe, for use against
land fortificvations. The 16-inch guns
ot be put on the four American bat
tleships for which bids will be opened
next month, they declare, have a range
sufficient to make them effective as
far as an enemy can be seen, even
under the most favorable circum
stances. For this reason they do not
believe employment of large and more
unwieldy types would be practicable
against tCe shifting targets of an open
sea engagement, however advantageous
they might be against land fortifica
tions. Fourteen-inch or 16-inch guns
can be carried in greater number and
fired with greater rapidity.
As a means of developing floating
forts, however, which could throw
great projecitles into land fortifica
tions out of sight over the horizon, the
reported British venture in battleship
construction is regarded by ordnance
experts here as having great possibil
ities. They estimate that shells weigh
ing nearly 3,000 pounds could be used
effectually and point out that an
18-inch gun would have a range equal
Is not greater than the average Eu
ropean coast defense ordance.
.What effect development of such en
gines of war might have on future
building plans of the American navy,
no officials would predict. It was said
plans for armament for the battleships
ot be bid next month and completed
three years hence would not be chang
ed. The largest guns carried now by any
naval vessel, so far as shown by re
cords here, are 15 -inch rifles mounted
on some of the latest British, German
and Italian battleships. The largest
on any American ship are those of
the 14-inch type carried by the Penn
sylvania and vessels of her class.
POSSES ARE SEARCHING
FOR TRAIN ROBBERS
Who Took Registered Mail Pouches
From Michigan Central Train.
Detroit, Mich., Sept. 28. The rob
bers who held up the New York-Chicago
express on the Michigan Central
Railroad ten miles west of here last
night were still at large late today.
Government detectives and Detroit of
ficers at the head of posses that have
been searching for the bandits, said no
clues had been obtained.
One of the two registered mail
pouches which were taken from the
mail car was found today about 100
wards from where the robbers stop
ped the train. The pouch was slit and
was empty.
It is believed that at least five men
figured In the robbery.
More than a dozen important rob
beries and several murders have been
committed by bandits in Michigan
during the last three months. Most of
these crimes, were perpetrated In and
febout XJeOroit. Nde of the criminals
have Been captured.
FRANC!
BAPAUME AND PERONNE
by the Russians were repulsed in
hand-to-hand fighting.
The Russian general staff announces
that since General Brussiloff began his
offensive 420,000 officers and men of
the - Teutonic allies have been made
prisoner and 600 cannon and 2,500 ma
chine guns and mine throwers have
been captured.
Around Petrozny and Hermannstadt,
in Transylvania, the Teutonic allies
and the Rumanians are engaged in bit
ter fichting, but with no important re
sult having bean attained by either
side. The situation in the Dobrudja
region is unchanged.
On the Macedonian front Paris re
ports the repulse of Bulgarian attacks
on both sides of Fiorina. There have
been bombardments by the British of
.positions of the allies of the central
powers by land batteries In the vicin
ity of Dorain and by warships in the
Aegean sea.
Aside from an infantry attack by
the Austrians in the upper Cordevol
valley, which Rome says was repulsed,
only artillery duels have taken place
in the Austro-Italian theatre.
Greece s entry into the war on the
side of the entente allies has not yet
been announced. An unofficial des
patch from Athens gives the text of
the proclamation of a provisional gov
ernment in Crete by former Premier
Venizelos and Admiral "Coundovriotrs
which declares that if the icing should
decide not to take the lead of the na
tional forces, "it is our duty to do the
needful thing to save the country from
the threatening ruin."

WILSON OPENS CAMPAIGN
OF LETTER WRITING
Thanks President of Women's Demo
cratic Club of Portland, Ore.
Long Branch, N. J., Sept. 28. In a
message opening his campaign of let
ter writing, President Wilson declar
ed that "the question is about to be
determined whether we shall keep the
nation upon its present terms of peace
and good will with, the world or turn.
to radical changes of polipy which
may alter the whole aspect of the na
tion's life."
The president wrote the letter to
Miss Leona Larrabee, president of the
Women's Democratic Club of Port
land, Oregon, thanking her for work
being done i nhis behalf by the org
anization.
"I cannot help having the feeling,
said the president's letter, "that the
intelligent women of Oregon need 'no
suggestion or intimation from me as
to what are the real issues of the
present campaign or the real concern
thaV-women must have with those is
sues. As a very sincere advocate or
the extnsion of suffrage to women, it
seens to me k very great disservice
to the cause that partisan use should
be made of it, principally at a time so
critical as this, when the question is
about to be determined whether we
shall keep the nation upon its present
terms of peace and good will -with the
world or turn to radical changes of
policy which may alter the whole as
pect of the nation's life."
INVESTIGATION OF LIVESTOCK
INDUSTRY IS REQUESTED
In a Resolution to be Presented to the
American Bankers Association.
Kansas City, Mo., Sept. 28. Con
gressional investigation of the live
stock industry, including the produc
tion, marketing, slaughter, distribu
tion and sale of all cattle was asked
here today in a resolution presented
to the American Bankers' Association.
Action on the resolution was deferred
until tomorrow.
"We face the alarming fact that for
two years the production of cattle has
not kept pace with the increase, of
population, but has decreased in num
ber, the resolution reads. It follows:
"With thousands of acres of virgin
land being brought annually- under the
plow, we have reduced our annual
average production per acre to about
ntty per cent or the production of our
virgin soils, producing today less than
half the average per acre of European
farm. Yet our nation is in its infan
cy." Despite the present prosperity,
characterized as the greatest the
country has ever known, bankers are
making less profit than at any time
within the last twenty years. State
ments to that effect were made to the
convention by Joseph Chapman, of
Minneapolis.

Hughes Hammers
the Adamson Law
TELLS WHY HE DID NOT URGE
REPUBLICANS TO FILIBUSTER
DOES NOT BELIEVE IN IT
Read Letters Proving His Contention
That 300,000 Firms Had Asked Pres
ident Wilson to Act Quick to Pre
vent Railroad Strike.
Saratoga Springs, N. Y., Sept. 28.
Charles E. Hughes tonight told the
republican unofficial state convention
here why he had not urged republican
senators to filibuster "to the last
ditch" against the passage of the
Adamson eight hour law passed to
avert the threatened railroad strike.
The nominee declared he did not be
lieve in filibustering, for one thing,
and that if the. majority in congress
had determined to pass the bill there
was no reason whatever why its pass
age should have been delayed by fili
bustering tactics.
Administration Acted With Swiftness
"It (the administration) acted with
swiftness," Mr. Hughes said, "and it
cannot now cry that a republican can
didate a thousand miles away should
have saved it from carrying out its
fixed determination."
Hughes Read Correspondence.
The nominee read to the convention
correspondence between Chairman
Newlands of the senate interstate
commerce committee, Harry A. Wheel
er, chairman of the committee on rail
road situation of the Chamber of
Commerce of the United States, and
President Wilson none of the letters
was from the president, but he was
addressed in the correspondence to
uphold his contention that 300,000
firms and corporations in country had
ahked the president to take action be
fore the threatened strike situation be
came acute. Mr. Hughes also rjuoted
an extract from the president's ad
dress to congress on the subject to
support his claim that the bill should
not have been passed.
A question asked by Richard Olney,
secretary of state under President
Cleveland, as to why Mr. Hughes had
not urged republican senators to fili
buster against this bill, was made the
occasion of Mr. Hughes' declaration.
NOMINEE HUGHES RESENTS
RICHARD OLNEY'S CRITICISM
About
Doffing Judicial Ermine
to
Don Garb of Seeker for Office.
Saje.to?a- Springs, N. Y, Sept. 28.
ft(auv 1 a .. uiuuys -. "lticism or Charles
E. Hughes and his campaign was an
swered tonight by Mr. Hughes in a
speech before the republican unofficial
state convention which repeatedly
brought the delegates to their feet to
cheer and applaud.
"The distinguished former secretary
of state said 'in substance that I dof
fed the judicial ermine and appeared
in the motley garb of a seeker of of
fice," Mr. Hughes said. "I did doff the
judicial ermine and I -submit to you
that it well from my shoulders unsul
lied. "No American need apologize for
being a candidate for office, least of
all I. I had no desire to return to
politics, but there came a summons
no honorable man could refuse. I did
assume the garb, call it motley or
what you wiil. I am now before the
American, people seeking the highest
office in its gift,
"For what purpose? Not that I covet
power, but I do covet the opportunity,
if it is afforded, to maintain Ameri
can rights and Ameriscan honor."
America had no occasion to get in
to war, the nominea continued, con
cerning its known rights, "with any
nation if we know how to convince
that nation that we are firm in main
taining them."
NEW YORK REPUBLICANS
TO WELCOME HUGHES
Recess Taken in Conference at Sara
toga Springs Pending His Arrival.
Saratoga Springs, N. Y., Sept. 28.
Generous support for every stand
Charles E. Hughes has taken in his
campaign for the presidency and
hearty endorsement of Governor
Whitman's administration mark the
platform which the republicans, in
state conference here, adopted early
tonight. A recess then was taken
pending the arrival of the presiden
tial candidate while the leaders con
tinued their plans for giving him one
of the warmest receptions he has re
ceived thus far during his campaign.
An eleventh hour change in the
plans of the leaders' induced by the
arguments of Chairman William R.
Wlllcox of the National republican
committee and United States Senator
James W. Wadsworth, eliminated from
the platform as adopted the tentative
plank intended to place the .party on
record as favoring a return to the
system 'of nominating state officers by
conventions. Although the general
sentiment was overwhelmingly in fa
vor of the reversion to the convention
system, the belief finally prevailed
that it was inadvisable to recommend
the change at this time.
Prior to the final business session
of the conference, the state commit
tee selected presidential electors. Con
trary to expectations, no progrsslves.
were, named. Vacancies were left in
six congressional districts, however,
and members of that party may be
selected to fill these.

VALUE OF ALCOHOL
Discussed by Chemists Attending Na
tional Exposition in New York.
New York, Sept. 28. Increased in
dustrial value of alcohol and the pos
sibility of its substitution for gaso
line in the near future were discussed
here today by chemists attending the
National Exposition of Chemical In
dustries. "The only fuel in sight which prom
ises to take the place, or hold down
the price of gasoline, is alcohol," said
Dr. Arthur D. Little of 'Boston, who
presided at the conference.
Dr. Little declared that alcohol is
the best fuel for internal combustion
engines, as benzol, which had been
suggested as a substitute for gasoline,
is not sufficiently plentiful to keep
three million automobiles in this coun
try going for two days. Kerosene, he
added, was out of the question.
