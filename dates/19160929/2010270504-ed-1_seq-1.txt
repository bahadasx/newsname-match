More Style More
Value More Quality
You get more for your money in COLLEGIAN
Clothes than ever before, with an individuality of style
and perfection of tailoring seldom found in garments
at the price.
The fabrics are unusually well chosen. Especially is
'this true of the Cassimeres, plain Grays, dark and light
Serges, Worsteds in browns and grays and Cheviots.
ADLER'S
Collegian Clothes
Nothing-but durable material and expert workman
ship are put into COLLEGIAN Clothes, insuring value
for which one usually has to pay a pretty good price.
A try'on will convince you and it takes only a few
minutes.
