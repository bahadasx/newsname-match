RICHLAND
!
If you want a real automobile
ride, one that will make you
proud that you live where we
are soon to have the real thing,
take a spin up Big Richland.
You can go on high speed from
the corporate limits to George
Jarvis's store without a jolt.
Not only that, but you can now
go over the route from Barbour
ville to the Christian church on
Middlefork, the DIXIE HIGH
WAY as is laid out by the Fiscal
Court, and where it will no doubt
be built when the matter is final
ly settled. They have not stop
ped there, but they have put the
road leading from Emanuel to
Gray in first-class condition, and
you can now make the trip over
that route into Corbin with all
kinds of ease.
The citizens of that neighbor
hood have waked up to the fact
that they are going to have the
eflicial route of the Dixie High
way through that community,
and they are making prepara
tions to have the tour of inspec
tors who will pass through here
next month come their way. It
is a matter of fact that they will
go over the route that is in the
best condition, and a committee
of these citizens will meet that
inspection committee somewhere
up the road and pilot them thru
that way and over that route.
They will have the road in a
splendid condition and will in
sist that they come tneir way.
There lias been much said as
to whoro the road should be
built, and the Fiscal Court has
given it much study, and the
matter has been up before the
State Road Commissioner, who
has gone over this route. They
have taken into consideration
where to build the road so that
it will cost the least money and
serve the most people and they
have finally settled down on this
route, it surely must be the right
way to go. There are eight Jus
tices of the countv, and we are
told that seven out of the eight
have agreed with the State Road
Commissioner that this is the
feasible way to go and it must
be so.

WINS FIRST PRIZE
Something like a year ago the First National Hank of Harbour-
villc organized a Hoys Pig Club in Knox County and turned oven
to ten boys, ten pure bred Duroc gilts, free of charge. The pigsj
from these gilts were turned over to otho hoys and the member-1
ship of the club enlarged. Some of these pigs were entered in the
Knox County Fair and took first prize. Two of these pigs were

eniereo in me uoya rig uiuu coniusi :u me oiaiu rair at l,ouis-
ville last week. A large number of pigs from all parts of the State
competed, but the first and fourth prizes were awarded to the
Knox County pigs. It is quite an honor to Knox Count. to win
first prize in such a contest at the State Fair. Mr. T. F. Faulkner's
sons won the first and fourth prizes. It was decided that the
First National Bank pig was the best bear pig m the State. These
two pigs weighed right at 1500 lbs. on the day they were six months
old. These pigs are now eligible to enter the American Stock
Show at Chicago, and they stand a good show to win there.
This Hank has also introduced a lot of pure bred chickens, and
is trying to interest the farmers of the county in spraying their
orchards, knox County can do things when she tries. Our
farmers ought to take an interest in these efforts of the Hank.
The First National Bank prospers and deserves to do so. because it
looks always to the interest of Knox County. Other business in
stitutions would do well to join in this work. Let us work together
and build up our county. Help the farmers and you will insure
the prosperity of your county.
A New Book Written
By a Barbourville Man
Rev. J. W. Ligon, pastor of
the Christian Church, is the
author of a book entitled "Paul
the Apostle." The book is from
the press of Fleming H. Kevell
Company, New York, and retails
at one dollar. After reading the
book. Lieutenant Governor Jas.
D. Black addressed the following
letter to the author:
"Barbourville, Ky.,
Sept. 21, 1910.
Rev. John W. Ligon.
Barbourville, Ky.
My dear Doctor:
I have read with fixed inteiv t
your book entitled Paul the
Apostle.
But before beginning its study,
I was somewhat improved with
the thought that something
of boldness (here using the word
in the sense of commendable
confidence) was obvious in the
undertaking at this day to con
tribute a new treatise to the
many already written about the
Apostle to the Gentiles. I had
the notion that the subject bad
been exhausted.
But the first chapter of your
book securely fixed my attention,
and I was carried on with in
creasing interest to the end of
the closing chapter. It is most
certainly a well written book.
It supplies a need many like my
self did not know of. The style
is attractive, the diction all that
one should desire, and in com
pass and treatment, your book is
just what the busy person and
the teacher need.
It will surely receive the favor
able consideration of those who
are interested in the study of the
life and character of the great
Apostle Paul, and should find a
place among the books of every
reader and lover of Christian
literature.
Very cordially yours,
James D. Black."
P. S. -The above mentioned
book can be obtained from the
author at the regular price of
$1.00. A large number have
been sold.

Judge Hammons
Issues Warrants.
Last Wednesday Thos. G.
Hammons, County Judge, issued
forty-three warrants for parents
and guardians who have failed
to send children of the right age
to the public schools, in this
county. He did this upon in
formation furnished him by the
teachers of the county, and it
has just begun: you had better
get busy, he is going to get ou
if you do not send your children
to school. The laws of the State
of Kentucky is ver plain, and
you will be made to pay the
penalty if you fail to get voiir
children into school. So get
busi -this is a gentle reminder.

ATHING OF BEAUTY
IS A JOY FORLVER"
NfW that flower bed in the
court house yard has. certainly
been "A Thing of Beauty, " and
likewise has been ery much en
joyed by all of our citizens, and
we will be sorry when Jack Frost
comes with his icy fingers and
lays it low.
Those beautiful King Humber
Cannas were donated b Miss
Nola Minton of our to. . the
bulbs were donated and they
were planted by her own hands,
Mr. Kenedy giving the rich loam
to enrich the bed. We wish
there were more Miss Mintons
in our town, for besides being a
young lady of an unusual amount
of energy we believe we judge
rightly when we say combined
with this energetic nature is a
-"aii i.u.Sunu
I love -for well, do we know that
her beautif'". :'. which
i she has an abundance, have found
their way into many a home of
sickness and bereavement, where
they have added rays of bright
ness to the sad ones. Besides
she and her mother have contri
buted their lovely blossoms to
' ' Mr friends on many festive oc
casions. We are proud of such people,
and of all like them people who
are possessed of such admirable
traits of charactei should be ap
preciated; and thrice welcomed
to our town.
Let us learn a lesson of Miss
Minton, and try to have more
Civic pride, planting flowers and
trees too, and otherwise improv
ing our already beautiful little
town, until strangers coming in
will say truthfully. Barbourville
is "The Queen City of the Moun
tains." We don't wish to forget Mrs.
Baker of our town who planted
the lovely Chrysanthemums
next the court house wall, we all
know that Mrs. Baker has lots
of Civic pride, for her own yard
and premises show that. What a
beautiful town we mignt have,
if flowers instead of uglv weeds
were growing in all the waste
places.
