THE NEGPO YEAR BOOK FOR
1916-1917.
The Negro Year Book for 1916-1917,
the fourth annual edition, has been
enlarged and improved. There are
60 more pages of matter than in the
1914-1915 edition, which contained 417
pages. This new edition has over 100
pages of new matter. The informa-
tion contained in previous volumes
has been revised and brought down to
date, 75 pages are devoted to a review
of the events of 1914-15 as they affect
the interests and indicate the progress
of the race.
The success of the previous editions
has encouraged the publishers to be
lieve that the Negro Year Book is
filling the need of a publication which
impartially gives areview of current
events as they relate to the Negro
and at the same time provides a com
pact but comprehensive statement of
historical and statistical facts ar
ranged for ready reference. In its
475 pages one finds in a succint form
not only the important facts of the
history of the Negro, but also a great
mass of detailed information concern
ing present conditions and the prog
ress of the race. It is now the stand
ard authority on matters pertaining
to the Negro. Price 35 cents postpaid.

REPUBLICANS MUST WIN.
It is our ardent hope and should be
the desire of at least every colored
voter that the republican party should
elect not only Judge Hughes and Fair
banks, but that both branches of the
American congress should be repub
lican.
There are many reasons why all of
our national republican ticket should
be elected.
First, because we are tired of demo
cratic hard times, starvation and stag
nation.
Second, because of democratic in
competency to successfully manage
this great government.
Third, because President Wilson
and his party, through the Underwood
free trade bill, took our protective
tariff law away and gave us a section
al free trade. What I mean by sec
tional free trade was that the Under
Wood free trade bill took the protec
tive duty off of twenty products of
the north, such as oats, wheat, wool,
meats, dairy products, hay, potatoes,
etc., and it left the tariff duties on
southern products, such as rice, cot
ton, tobacco, angora hair, etc.
Fourth, because Wilson has meddled
in the present European war and came
nearly plunging this country into war
against Germany.
Fifth, because of his weak, vcssil
ating policy with the so-called rulers
of Mexico.
Sixth, because of his shameful and
weak foreign policies and his coward
ly stand for manhood rights.
Sixth, becnuse he has .not ottered his
voice against lynching nor done any
thing to protect innocent American
citizens from being shot down, killed
and murdered.
Seventh, because he has lowered
the dignity of a president or even a
statesman to stoop so low as to segre
gate, discriminate and draw the color
line in public offices in Washington
against a* class of Americans on ac
count of color. Only his rebel in
stincts and southern blood will not al
low him to render justice. In fact we
think that he has disgraced, dishon
ored the high ideals that America
stood for, liberty, justice and equality.
That he ought to resign. At any rate
we 2,000,000 Negro voters ought to
snow rebelism and democracy so deep
next November that they will never
thaw out for fifty years more.
EDITOR'S OBSERVATIONS.
Across the "Father of Waters" in
to Rock Island, Illinois, we landed.
This state is one of the wealthiest,
one of the most intelligent and pro
gressive, as well as one of the best
commercial states in our great sister
hood of states in America. What we
have said of the state applies to her
great citizenship, which is composed
of all nationalities of the world. In
Rock Island. Upon the island is lo
cated the great U. S. arsenal, where
hundreds of people are employed. We
have a colored population of about
900, two colored churches, the McKin
ley Baptist and the A. M. E. church.
Rev. G. E. Saunders is the pastor of
,ao nnnir pab the Baptist church, formerly of Iowa.

there and is doing fairly well. Dr. S.
C. Davis is the only physician here
ite sick at his home. He is
.t0-date, progressive physician
Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Liggions are living
at the same place and are working
at the same place. Also is J. H.
Slaughter, one of the old and highly
respected citizens. J. L. King is still
at the Harms hotel. Mr. D. G. Patter
son, our old friend, who formerly
lived in our city, is in the grocery
business, and had located in Rock Isl
and, and has a nice grocery store. He
has the only colored grocery store

pleasure of taking dinner with him.
Rev. B. R. Penn is still in the employ

have several people at the nome.
.Passing down to Moline. Here we
found a city of about 15,000 people, of
rwhich 500 are colored. Many of them
are working in the large factories and
workshops in this town, and it is
known as the town of factories. Rev.
A. Boyd has charge of the A. M. E.
church and is doing nicely. Rev. Jas.
Whitfield has charge of the Baptist
church. He is a very bright man and
is succeeding nicely. S. P. Walker is
still janitor at the school house. Mr.
Colquitt still works at the department
store. He owns a nice piece of prop*
erty at 1029 Thirteenth avenue. Mr.
P. N. Tarver is still working for the
Moline Carriage company. H. W.
Harding, formerly o^jRock Island,has
moved to this city. He is still stenog
rapher at the arsenal, and is doing
nicely. There are no colored people
in business in this town to my knowl
edge, either professionally or commer
cial. It seems to me it would be a
good opportunity for business of vari
ous kinds here. We next moved to
Monmouth, HI., the county seat of
Warren county, and found colored
people doing as well as could be ex
pected under democratic hard times.
Those who are in business are holding
their own, and hoping for better
times. I told them they could assist
in bringing about better times by
changing the administration. Mr. S.
Cox is a contract carpenter and is
meeting with success. He has all the
work he can do. He owns a nice sev
en passenger car and a beautiful
home. J. T. Wallance is still in busi
ness, running a soft drink parlor. He
owns a small truck farm near the city
limits. Old man Richmond is still in
the grocery business, having a good
trade. He is reported to be one of the
wealthiest men in this county. Mrs.
L. B. Catlin still operates her hair
dressing parlors in the Searles build
ing. She has one of the most expensive
fitted and up-to-date parlors that I
have seen, and is enjoying a good
trade. Her husband also has a barber
shop in the same building, but on a
different floor. In this building the
elevator is run by a colored girl,
which is a very unusual thing in this
section of the country. In fact I do
not recall another instance where this
is found. She has been here several
years. Mr. G. W. Jones, with whom
I stopped, is still the house doctor for
this part of the state. He is doing
nicely, and is .well posted upon the dif
ferent literature of the day, perhaps
taking more colored papers and mag
azines than any ot^er man in this sec
tion of the state'. He informed me
that there was about fourteen fam
ilies who have automobiles in this
town, which breaks the record of any
town of this size in the northwest. Mr.
Jones is an independent man in poli
tics and in thought. D. D. Starr is
in the auto business, repairing and fix
ing autos. He has a good trade. Miss
Bernice Metlock will still chronicle
thenews for this town. Mr. and Mrs.
Peoples are working at the same
place. Mrs. Peoples is quite promi
nent in church and club work. They
recently gave a reception in honor of
the eighth grade and high school and
college graduates since 1891. Below
we run the names only of the high
school and college graduates. High
