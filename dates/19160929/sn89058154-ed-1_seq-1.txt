Road Working
0ing to disappointment in getting
a foreman to take charge of the prac
tical road w?rV, after two days work
it waa deemed advisable to suspend
further actual work until next Mon
day, hoping it may rain before that
time. The committee now know from
work Monday and Tuesday about what
teams are needed, and the divinion of
labor. The worst place on any of the
road, one mile south of Selmer, waa
almost finished Tuesday. The toois
needed are now at hand, and things
will be pushed when work begins
again. Everything is satisfactory,
and dirt will fly.

erected which will cost one' and one
half million' dollars; two lives have
been lost thus far in. the erection..
It is thought that East Nashville
will never be rebuilt. There are
only 3 houses erected ia that vast
vacant territory of about 8Q0 lots.
The people lost everything, and the
new buildings must be fireproof.
Nashville a few days ago appealed
to the supreme court and the L. & N.
lost their fee of $3 which they
charged other roads for transferring
freight cars. ' This is a great gain to
the city of Nashville.
- There are over 100 school in this
city, so you see wh.7 it is called the
Athens of the South. It is not the
greatest of cities, but every citizen of
the) state should be proud of it and
pay it at least one .visit in life.

On starting Tuesday evening of last
week, Iwas delayed at Finger on ac
count of a "freight wreck on the
switch caused by an I C. train break
ing in two; and this was some little
jam. After two and a half hours we
passed and got to Jackson, stopping
over at the Hefley boarding house,
whore I found beds good and nice.
Wednesday at 8:30, leaving' for
Nashvilltyon my way I saw the N. C.
& St. L. demonstration farm, which
was beautiful; and at Camden, Tenn.,
they are straightening the road. I
guess Mr. Horry Hodges is responsi
ble for this. We might have had our
road straightened if he had stayed in
Selmer.
"Riding; pure is the stream,
Fresh is the scene."
Passing, I arrived at Nashville 1:40
p m., caught a car to the fair, after
first being located.
' WHAT I SAW AT THE FAIR
Fine racing, extraordinary agricul
tural exhibits, truck garden and farm
products, fruits nicer than painted
pictures, which just make your mouth
water. ! saw the fine live stock
parade of all kinds and breeds from
100 pounds to 2.000 pounds; silos,
. farm implement, auto display of the
world, and a cpw milker which would
milk many thousand cows a day; two
disc plows pulled by traction engines
breaking 7 acres, fuel, 20 gallon coal
oil driver. Six diavelo girls held ten
thousand people spellbound while per
forming their feats.
Some of the places I visited: The
1 fair 3 days, my cousin Andrew Hipps;
my friend Master Estell McAlpin,
in the Tennessee Industrial School,
whero I saw wonderful campus
grounds, nice buildings, plenty of
games for passtirae. Estell is making
good and .Is studying telegraphy and
music and belongs to the T. I. S,
Band. Tha .superintendent of this
school has had charge 40 years; a
lady also 33 years; so tils shows they
are the best or they could not have
' itajed there so long. My idea: I be
lieve this is a great school, and is a
roanufacturine Dlant of men and
women. ,
' The average attendance at the fair
was about fifteen thousand per day.
I visited the State Capitol, city
market square, postoffice, high schoo
building, churches,, the Stalhman
building, seeing over the city, and
saw the Arcade, where 50,000 people
pass through every day of tho year
a 4th national bank building being
