and Thiepval showed the Allied su

Ha.g's artillery has caused great trrati
lieation in the Britiah command.
Another encouraging feature of the
last British OaTeaeive is Haig'* report
that the capture of the German strong
holda uas made at a singularly low
cost. The total casualties did not ex
ceed twice the number af prisoners.
It is no secret that the early British
galns were made at a heavy cost This
was indicated clearly by the daily cas- i
ualty lists, which averaged nearly five,
thousand daily for several weeks, al- j
thougb in the last few days they have
been running- much lower.

Much heavy t'ghting remains. how?
ever, before Bapaume and Peronne can

attempt its capture.
Be tnt as is practicable, the policy
of damaging tawaa that nre larger
