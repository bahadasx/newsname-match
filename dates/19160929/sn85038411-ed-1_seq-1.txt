Two Interned German
Cruisers Escorted to
Phila. by U. S. Warships
Norfolk, Va., Sept. 29. —The in
terned German auxiliary cruisers
Kronprinz Wilhelm and Prinz Eitel
Friedrich left the Norfolk navy yard
early to-day for Philadelphia where
they are to be laid up for the re
mainder of the war. A squadron of
American battleships waited off the
Virginia Capes to escort the cruisers
up the coast and serve the double
purpose of preventing their escape
and guarding interference by allied
warships.
The Prinz Eitel Friedrich went out
under her own steam while five tugs
towed the Kronprinz Wilhelm.
Newport News, Va., Sept. 29.—The
German cruisers passed Old Point at
10:15 o'clock this morning and headed
for the capes. Twelve American bat
tleships headed by the flagship
Wyoming had moved out to sea an
hour earlier and were waiting off the
capes to convoy the interned vessels
up the coast. Only two of the battle
ships were assigned by the Navy De
partment to the convoying squadron,
but as, the Philadelphia navy yard is
the hdme station of them all, the
twelve will go up the coast together.
Mrs. Le Due Is Improved;

Stand on Her Behalf
Philadelphia. Sept. 29 —Mrs. Joseph
..r. Le Due, of Chicago, who was ser
iously injured in the triple shooting at
a hotel here early Wednesday morn

soon be able to perform an operation
to extract the steel—jacketed bullet
that is lodged between ribs on her left
side.
Joseph C. Lc Due, the injured wom
an's husband, said to-day that he had
received many telegrams commending
hini for the stand he had taken in
upholding the honor of his wife. He
visited her and remained as long as
her condition permitted.
Relatives of Mrs. Harry Belzer, of
New York, who shot Mrs. Le Due,
killed J. C. Graveur, also of New York,

making efforts to prove that Mrs. Bel
zer was a woman of honor.

Congressman Aaron S. Kreider de

evening.
"The Mexican situation is of our

"Except for the attitude of Wood

Woman Alone in Cottage,
Beaten and Strangled; Fire
Started to Cover Crime
Mountainview, N. H., Sept. 29.
Mrs. Frederick L. Small, wife of a
Boston real estate broker, who was
burned in a fire which destroyed the
Small summer home at Lake Ossipee
last night, was murdered, It was dis
covered to-day when her body was
taken from the ruins. She had been
beaten over the head and strangled
by a rope tied around her neck.
The police believe the fire was
started to cover the crime. By a
mere chance, however, this failed. The
body dropped into the basement and
the head and neck lodged in a pool
of water. The rope which had been
drawn twice around the neck was
preserved.
Small had left his cottage for Bos
ton six hours before the fire was dis
covered. He said his wife was alone
in the cottage when he departed.
Later on his own authoritv. Sheriff
Chandler placed Small under arrest
pending instructions from the countv
solicitor.
The agent of a life insurance com
pany to-day made known that in
January last he had written a joint
policy on the lives of Small and his
wife, Mrs. Arlene Small, for $20,000.
He solicited the business, he said, and
both the husband and wife partici
pated in the negotiations that led to
the issuance of the policv.
Before his arrest, Small had an
nounced that he would give SI,OOO
for the discovery of the person who
killed his wife. After his arrest he
refused to make any statement.
Tn 1909 Small sued A. H. Soden,
widely known as one of the three
owners of the Boston National League
baseball club for $500,000 for aliena
tion of Mrs. Small's affections. He
was awarded SIO,OOO.

challenged an Arapahoe to combat
during a clash over a resolution pro

Dr. Charles L. Montasuma, an
Apache, in the course of a speech
attacking the Indian Bureau directed
his remarks at Dr. Sherman Coolldge,

"I am an Apache," he shouted, "and
you are an Arapahoe. I can lick you.
My tribe has licked your tribe before."
"I'm from Missouri," shouted Dr.
Coolidge, and the laughter that fol
lowed broke the tension.

11,000 CHILDREN
BACK IN SCHOOL;
100 ARE BARRED
Boys and Girls in Paralysis
District Will Get Two Weeks'
More Vacation
All but 100 youngsters of the 11.-
000 public school children in the city
returned to the buildings to-day, re
ceived their books and were assigned
to classes to begin the Pall term of
school, alter almost a month's delay
because of the State quarantine.
The 100 boys and girls in the dis
trict from Thirteenth to Crescent, and
from Mulberry to Kittatinny streets,
will not be permitted to enter school
for at least two weeks, because of the
case of infantile paralysis which de
veloped in that district several days
ago.
All enrollment records at the High
Schools were broken to-day when
more than 1,600 pupils were entered
in the four classes in the Central and
Technical schools.
In the Allison Hill district every
available room was filled and in the
West End district eight rooms of the
new W. S. Steele building were opened
to provide for the increasing number
of school children.
Although much of the time this
morning was devoted to giving out
supplies, many of the teachers began
work this afternoon. Nothing has
been decided upon by the school
board, to make up for the eighteen
days' lost time because of the State
quarantine.
Parochial schols will open on Mon
day morning with an enrollment of
more than 800 pupils, it was an
nounced to-day, and the Harrlsburg
Academy sessions will begin also on
Monday. At the Riverside school, 175
students are enrolled in the various
courses. Private schools will open
next week also. Beginners may start
during the next two weeks provided
their parents present the proper vac
cination certificate when they take
them to the buildings.
Approximately 13,000 students in
the city will be hard at work within
a few days. Owing to the big increase
in the number enrolled in the domes
tic science course at Central High
School, Miss Eleanor Leonard, of the
sewing department, will assist Miss
Frances Hamilton in instructing the
classes.
TOBACCO FOR TROOPS
The third shipment of supplies for
the 3 4 Pennsylvania railroad shop em

next week. One large box con
t> nirg, cigars, cigarets, smoking and
chewing tobacco went to the bovs in
the Eighth regiment, and the other to
members of the Governor's Troop.
These supplies were paid for from a.
fund raised by the employes of the
local shops under the direction of Mas
ter Mechanic J. L. L. Cunningham.

Chihuahua City, Mexico., Sept. 29.
More than 100 Villa followers were

Cribe was taken prisoner and heavy
casualties were suffered by Carranza

rlachlc, an Important mining center
about fifty miles southwest of Chihua

ceived last evening by General Trevino
from General Matlas Ramos, who was
himself slightly wounded.
Details of the fight were few and
were appended to the request of Gen
eral Ramos for surgeons and medical
supplies. A hospital corps detach
ment was rushed to the scene by train.
It is stated the garrison at Cuslhuir
iachic co-operated with the forces of
Ramos, but whether they were at
tacked or had been the aggressors does
not appear.
Baudello Uribe, leader of the band
and Villa's chief lieutenant, was the
originator of the practice of cutting
off the ears of captured Government
soldiers. Many others of his com
mand are reported to have been made
prisoners.

HUGHES MOTORS
THROUGH RAIN
TO MAKE SPEECH
Speaks on Tariff at Bingham
ton; Need Protection as Well
as Revenue
Binghamtoru X. Y.. Sept. 29.—Charles
E. Hughes motored through the first
rainstorm he has experienced since
commencing his campaign, August 5,
to address an audience in the Opera
House here to-day. It was his first
speech of the day.
The strenuous program laid before
him by the national chairman was
vetoed by the nominee himself, who
merely appeared on the rear platform
of his car so that the crowds might see
him at stations between Saratoga and
Binghamton. It had been arranged
to have him speak at these stations,
but at the last moment it was decided
to have local speakers take his place
so that he might conserve his voice.
Mr. Hughes spoke of the protective
tariff. "I tell you, fellow citizens," he
said, "we are facia* a critical period.
It is no time to be talking of a tariff
for revenue only. We need protection
to our industries, and there is no man
in the country to-day who can tell you
where the Democratic party stands
with respect to protection of American
interests.
United States and to make our country
prosperous, and we'll never do it un
less labor and capital work together
amicably."
The nominee renewed his attack on
tithe administration for the Adamson
bill. He declared that he "would like
to see an eight-hour workday," but
that he stood squarely for Investigation
before legislation and would "not yield
an inch either to labor or capital" in
: that principle.
Cheered by Ten Thousand
Ten thousand persons, packing the
paddock in front of the grandstand at
the Interstate Fair, at Trenton, yes
terday, heard Mr. Hughes advocate a
protected American market and. in
President Wilson's home state, in the
oapitol where Mr. Wilson long was
Governor, also heard him criticise the
policies of the President and of the
Democratic party.
The great crowd applauded heartily
as the Republican candidate for Presi
dent condemned the Underwood tariff
bill, ridiculed the claim that Mr. Wil
son has kept the United States out of
war and pleaded for a Republican vic
tory to the end that a "permanent
prosperity" may be restored to sup

HOSPITAL NEEDED
Emergency Beds Must Be Pro

An emergency hospital to care for
typhoid epidemics was recommended
to-day by Health Officer Dr. J. M. J.
Raunlck. Ho will present his plans
to City Commissioner Harry P. Bow
man, some time to-day or to-morrow,
and urge Immediate action by the City
Commissioners. Dr, Raunick said:
"Further daily increases in the
number of typhoid fever cases in
Harrisburg will mean that the local
hospitals will not be able to take care
of all the cases. Something must be
done, and now Is the time to do It.
There are places available in Harrls
burg where an emergency hospital
may be established.
"I understand one or more churches
can be leased, and several halls are
available, and would be suitable for
a hospital. I am looking over build
ings in the city and will be able to
tell later the plans I shall recom
mend. I understand the Pennsylvania
railroad has on hand a number of

west of Le Sars on the Pozieres-
Bapaume road, northeast of Courcel
ette. Le Sars is about three and one
half miles from Bapaume toward

HOI.I) FOR OPEN" SHOP
Honolulu. Sept. 29.—The Honolulu
Chamber of Commerce declared for
the open shop yesterday at a largely
attended meeting. A resolution was
adopted by a 10 to 1 vote declaring
that it would be the fixed and perma
nent policy of the chamber to support
the free right of every employe and
every individual to enter into contracts
of employment without interference
or dictation from outside parties or
organizations and to insist that Hono
lulu be maintained as an open port.
Union longshoremen went on strike
here September 18 when their de

Workers Are Idle in Sym

New York, Sept. 29.—Labor union
officials who attempted to organize a
general strike here and in West Ches
ter county in sympathy with the strik
ing street car men refused to-day to
admit defeat and still claimed that
nearly 200,000 workers had quit. They
announced, however, that efforts to
call out others would be postponed un-
Ui Monday next when a meeting of
the local federated unions would be
held to consider what action shall be
taken.
Hugh Frayne, chairman of the joint
labor conference committee which has
directed the attempt to call out all
trade unions, explained the postpone
ment of further action by saying many
of the unions had not had time to con
sider the strike call.
The most serious disappointment
suffered by the labor chiefs was the
action yesterday of the allied building
trades with a membership of 100 000
and the teamsters' union of 20 000
members if. postponing a decision' on
the strike issue.
The strikers in trades outside the
street car men include about 10 000
brewery workers and machinists. '

"The message we took to the

better highways and to secure for
them the educational advantages

it will meet the demands. and

they are going to do their share.
I asked them to elect legislators
who would look after the inter

be in sympathy with them and
who would do the right thing.
Pennsylvania is too big a State
