and his government in line with the
wishes of the mapority of Greek peo
ple who do not want any declaration
of the dethronement of the monarch.

RECORD EREAKING CROWD
Al OPENING OF OPERA HOUSE
With four hundred and fifty com
fortable opera chairs in place in the
new Ronan opera house, still standing
room was at a premium last Saturday
night when the new play house was
dedicated by the Missoula Elk's Min
strels. The finishing touches were
placed on the new building only a few
minutes before the performance begun,
and without time to give it a trial test
the show commenced. Everything
worked like a charm, the lights being
perfect and the curtains and stage pro
perty shifting with ease and perfection.
About forty people comprised the min
strel troupe and the commodious stage
provided ample room at all times.
The show itself was up to all expec
tations, the jokes cracked by the end
men being new and up to the standard,
the nigger songs good, while the solos
and the singing of the male quartet and
the specialties in dancing and song re
ceived meritorious and hearty applause.
The staging of the minstrel show for
the first performance in the new house
demonstrated fully that Ronan now has
an opera house in which any of the
better plays can be properly presented
and one that is beyond doubt equal to
any in Montana outside the largest
cities. This fact will undoubtedly draw
many of the better troups this way in
the future. Mr. Gehlert, the proprie
tor, is entitled to the praise of the
community for the enterprise he has
shown in giving us such'a building.

ONE OF THE LARGEST
EVER HELD IN DILLON
The Dillon correspondent for the
Butte Miner, writing under date of
September 24, says;
"The funeral of the late Don Q.
Rathbone, the dentist who accidentally
shot himself at Lewistown last Monday,
was held this afternoon at 2:30 o'clock
from the Masonic temple at Dillon.
"The funeral was one of the largest
which ever occurred in Dillon, the de
ceased being highly esteemed in all
harts of the county.
'-Dr. Horace Tilden of the Baptist
church delivered an impressive sermon
and a choir of Dillon's best voices ren.
dered special music, for the occasion."
The deceased was a double cousin of
C. F. and E. H. Rathbone of Ronan.
He came to Dillon from Red Oak, Iowa
nine years .go and with his brother,
Dr. R. R. Rathbone, has practiced
dentistry in Dillon until about two
months ago when he opened an office
in Lewistown. Mr. Rathbone was 38
years of age, served in the Phillipines
with the 51st Iowa and was a promi
nent Mason. Besides a wife and son
two years old he leaves a mother, three
brothers, five sisters and a large num
ber of more distant relatives and
friends.
C. F. Rathbone of Ronan attended
the funeral in Dillon last Sunday, re
turning Thursday.
Greatest in the Union
One of America's financial kings
praises Montana. P. A. Rockefeller
says:
"I have been coming to Montana for
a number of years, and more and more
I find its possibilities astounding. Mon
tana isdestined to be, in my opinion, the
greatest state in the Union. She has
resources unparalleled, diversified re
sources not given to any other of her
sister states. I can easily believe any
thing I hear of the wonderful resour
ces of your state, for I know in all in
vestigations I have made, not one-half
has been told me. And I want to say
that you have in Montana just as great
a resource in your men, for you have
that kind of sturdy Anglo-Saxon man
hood that builds empires."
Mr. Hughes is criticised' for his fre'
quent use of the word, "now." Evi
dently his Immediateness is worrying
the watchful waiters, who put things
off until tomorrow.

AND THE WORST
IS YET TO COME
The cost of living this winter will
reach an unprecedented scale, and will
affect every person, no matter what
item may be purchased, according to a
table of comparative prices compiled by
Chicago dealers. Merchants and pro
ducers are virtually unanimous in a
forecast of further increases in prices,
which have already advanced alarming
ly within the last year.
Food prices, it is said, vary accord
ing to quality and quantity, but it is
the small purchaser at retail who must
pay most. Wholesalers say canneries
throughout the country have informed
them that fall and winter deliveries
will be only one-third normal, while the
last vegetable crop is said to be only
half the quantity expected.
Canned fruits will be 30 per cent.
higher and canned vegetables are ex
pected by wholesalers to increase 20
per cent, in price.
Paper bags, in which the housewife
carries home her market purchases,
have increased in cost from 95 cents in
wholesale lots to $1.55. This advance
is typical of all paper products.
Cotton goods have advanced between
25 and 35 per cent. Woolens have kept
pace with cottons.
The best lines of women's shoes for
fall and winter will cost twice as much
as the same article last year, dealers
say.
Even collars, that two-for-a-quarfer
staple which men have known for gen
erations, will be a thing of the past.
Collars now have been advanced to 15
cents each and the laundries which
have for years laundered collars for
J. cents have announced that 3 cents
each will be the future cost.
Cigar jobbers raised their prices this
week to between $4 and $5 a thousand
to the dealer.

BUSINESS CORNER
CVAROES BANDS
One of the best business corners ir
Ronan, the one southeast of the Ronar
State Bank formerly owned by Mr.
Powers of Tacoma, was sold last week
to A. J. Brower. Since securing the
property Mr. Brower has cut it up into
25-foot lots facing the north and is
selling it out to parties who desire to
build.
This corner, while always recognized
as one of the best in town, has been
vacant, the owner holding it as an in
vestment. That it has finally been
sold and placed on the market in small
er lots will help materially in the build
ing up of the business district.
Work on the foundation for the first
building on this corner was commenced
Wednesday. Messrs Pronovost and
Bailey have let the contract for a
structure 25x70 feet which when com
pleted will be occupied by them with a
pool hall. It is rumored that another
good building will be erected there in
the near future for a meat market,
while it is whispered that a two-story
brick 50x100 will occupy the corner
next summer.

ANOTHER OLD TIMER
CROSSES THE DIVIDE
Last Friday while reading his paper,
Robert James Watson, one of the ear
liest residents of this locality, passed
away., Thirty years ago in the prime
of life he came to Montana to make his
home and for the past eighteen years
has lived upon what was formerly
known as the Flathead Indian Reserva
tion. For a number of years he was in
charge of the government flour mill at
Ronan and was known by the people
of this vicinity as an upright and
honest citizen.
Mr. Watson was born at Seaforth,
Ontario Canada, October 26, 1850, and
died September 22, 1916. He leaves
surviving him two daughters, Mrs.
William 1ngle and Mrs. James Dupuis,
both residing at Ronan, Montana, who,
with many others who have known Mr.
Watson for many years mourn his
death,
One by one the old timers are passing
away and in a few years the familiar
features and form of those who know
this country best will have gone to
their last resting place. The services
were held in the M. E. church at Ro
nan, and burial took place at St.
Ignatius on September 23, Rev. Swish
er officiating.
BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAIN LAKES
WILL BECOME RESERVOIRS
Economic necessity, the force which
has brought us from savagery to civili
zation, is about to despoil tne scenic
beauty of Lakes Angus McDonald and
St. Mary, in whose crystal waters are
reflected the noble peaks and shining
glaciers of the Mission mountains.
These two bodies of water, which rival
in natural beauty the storied lakes of
Switzerland, are to become a part of
the Flathead reclamation project, and
will be used as auxillery reservoirs for
storage of water for irrigation.
At each of the lakes the U. S. re
clamation service now hrs a large force
of men at work erecting camps and
clearing away timber preparatory to
laying concrete for dams and flumes.
Lake McDonald will be raised 37 feet,
then tapped 20 feet below the present
water level, with a storage capacity of
about 13,000 acre feet.
Lake St. Mary will not be raised,
but will be tapped by a tunnel 70 feet
below the present water level, giving a
storage capacity almost as great as
that of Lake McDonald.
The engineers and crews now at
work at the two lakes recently arrived
here from the Jackson lake enlarge
ment project, a similiar undertaking,
though on a much larger scale.
Engineer Leigh Cairns is in charge
at Lake McDonald and Engineer F. F.
Smith at Lake St. Mary. It is esti
mated that two years will be required
to finish the two jobs, provided suffi
cient money is appropriated by con
gress to press the work to conclusion
without delays. -St. Ignatius Post.
ZEPPELIN SQUADRON
MAKES ANOTHER RAID
London, Sept. 26.-Forty-eight hours
after a monster fleet of Zeppeline had
raided London, with the loss of two
airships, the undaunted Germans made
another attack over the east coast and
northeast coast of England.
Official statements issued by the
war oflice tell of the raid, but do not
give any details of the newest air
attack or the n unber of victims. The
latest statement said: "Several hos
tile airships, probably six, visited the
northeastern and southern counties.
"Bombs were dropped in the north
ern counties and some casualties and
damage are reported.
"Full reports have not yet been re
ceived."
LOSE HOPE IN MAN HUNT
Sheriff Doubts Assailant of Girl Will
Be Captured.
Bemidji, Minn., Sept. 26.-After ha,
ing covered mile upon mile of forest,
fought their way through swamps and
combed every spot which might hide
the unidentified assailant of Olga i)ahl,
Round Lake school teacher, Sheriff
Charles Gunderson' of Itasca county
believes there is little hope the fugi
tive will be captured.
Although Gunderson has not given
up all hope of finding the man, he
feels only a luck chance will bring the
fugitive into his hands.
Searol& for the unidentified man pur
porting to be a minister, who was
driven out of Tenstrike ten days ago,
is Still' being followed.
FLANK COMBLES
IN GREAT CHARGE
London, Sept. 26.-Attacking simul
taneously on an are of fifteen miles,
running from Martinpuich to the
Somme, the British and French forces
delivered another smashing blow on
the German lines and pushed forward
their positions for notable gains.
From Martinpuich to Combles, a dis
tance of six miles, the British drove
in their wedge to a depth of more than
a mile and captured in the attack the
important strategic towns of Les
boeufs and Moravel, the latter a scant
mile north of Combles.
*To the French fell the town of Ran
court, two mila;s east, and the out
skirts of Rregicourt, one mile north
east of Combles. In addition trenches
near Fregicourt, in the vicinity of
Bouchavesnes and to the south from
the vicinity of the Canal Du Nord to
the Somme were taken.
The capture of Moravel by the Brit
ish and part of Fregicourt by the
French apparently seals the fate of
Combles, which the Germans have de
terminedly held for weeks despite the
violent attacks thrown against it.
Defenders Are Trapped.
The defenders of the virtually sur
rounded town have left to them for es
cape only the valley, a mile in width,
running north-northeast, and in the
traversing of which they must come
under the guns of the British and
French, respectively, from Moravel
and the vicinity of Fregicourt.
Another notable step in their ap
proach upon Peronne is marked in the
capture by the French of trenches in
the Canal Du Nord region.
Except in France there have been
no important engagements on,. any of
the various fronts. Berlin reports the
repulse of Russian attacks in Volhy
nia, Calicia and the Carpathian moun
tains.
Petrograd still is silent as to the op
erations on the Eastern front, but un
ofiicial advices say the Russians have
begun a new offensive on a large scale
in the hope of putting down the coun
ter-attacks of the Teutons and pierc
ing their front before winter sets in.
Battle on in Alps.
The Roumanians are still struggling
for supremacy over the Teutonic allies
in the Szurduk and Vulkan passes of
the Transylvania Alps, but, accord
ing to Berlin, all their attacks have
been repulsed.
In the Macedonlan campaign con
tinued reports of successes for the en
tente allies come from their various
war chancellories. West of Florina
the Russians have captured a hill
from the lulgars; the Serbians have
crossed the frontier into their own
country and reached a position north
of K rusograd, while the French north
east of l'lorina have penetrated the
ouiskirts of Petorak.
The British to the north of Lake Ta
hins, on the eatstern end of the bat
tie line, also report an advance, but
Berlin says that all their attacks were
repulsed.
