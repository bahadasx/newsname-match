PRIMUS COMMUNITY
AGAINREPRESENTED
WRITES ON MANY TOPICS
Says Heath Springs Is to Build
Flour Mill?Community
Crops Very Short.
Mr. Editor: I again take the
privilege of dotting a few lines for
The News. The farmers of this community
are busy gathering their
crops and making preparations to
sow wheat and oats. The cotton
crop is very short, not even half of
e crop will be made. The weed is
dying with the bolls unmatured. The
farmers are preparing to sow a largo
acreage of wheat this fall. There is
not a farmer in this community but
who is going to sow wheat, having
realized that the only salvation for
the farmer is to make his hog and
hominy at home, and raise cotton as
n surplus. Too many have their corn
cribs and smoke house away out in
the West. Next year promises to be
a hard year for the "clod-hopper,"
but *dth pluck and energy and
economy he can pull through and be
benefited from the lesson he has
learned this year.
While in town last Saturday I met
Uncle John S. Blackmon, who has
just returned from Texas, where he
has been visiting during the summer.
He said the crops are short in Texas,
not over a half. 1 asked Uncle John
how he liked Texas. He answered
very well, but?I asked him what
kind of people were the Texans. He
replied they are a good, clever people
but?but what Uncle John I asked?he
replied they are a lazy people,
and I saw some of them reaping
oats on Sunday. He further stated.
Texas will uo for a young man but
I am too old and it doesn't suit me.
I have a home here. "Home Sweet
Home." I asked him?do you eve'expect
to go back to Texas. He replied
I never expect to see Texas
again, however, if 1 werp in i?r? i?npir
I would have to leave Nancy here.
It Is quite Interesting to hear him
tell about the different things he saw
while in Texas.
Well, Mr. Editor, just a word
about our flour mill: As everybody
knows, I have been advocating it for
two years. While in Heath Springs
the other day I was informed that
we were going to have one in Heath
Springs without a doubt, and Heath
Springs people don't do things by
halves. What they propose they
perform. Now if Heath Springs gives
us a roller mill why not Lancaster
get busy and build a hospital for
Lancaster county. It. seems to m?
that such an institution would be a
paying proposition for any capitalist
to invest in, and I think if some
people get any worse than they have
fjT the last month, it would be a
'gobd idea for some man to advocate
a hospital for the insane at some
point in the county. At our last primary
election some peoples ideas
went wrong and they said some very
hard things about those who voted
for Governor Manning; saying they
voted the Republican ticket and that
they used money and bought votes.
Some very hard things have been
said about the writer of this article
but to these I give the following
advice: Before retiring take a large
dose of Dodson's Llvertone or Lax
Fos with which to cleanse the liver.
Can be found at any of the drug
stores and in the morning I think
they will feel better. As for buying
votes, I would regret to know
that I was on the cheap side that
could be bought or was on the market
for sale. B. F. ADAMS.

NEUTRALITY LAW
NOW DISCUSSED
TALK OF REVISION
Sutfuested Americans Should Re
Prevented From Participating
in Factional Conflicts.
New London, Conn., Sept. 26.?
Revision of American neutrality laws
with a view to discouraging Americans
from participating in Mexican,
factional conflicts was suggested at
the conference of the Mexican-American
joint commission here today. It
was indicated that Mexico could deal
more effectively with rebels and outlaws
if the neutrality laws were
amended so as to make it an offense
for an American citizen to participate
in a movement against a government
with which the United States
IB tii peace.
Discussion of neutrality laws was
incident to consideration of suggested
plans for the co-operation of the
two nations in maintaining peace
along the border. The Mexicans
charged that the inadequacy of the
American laws made possible the
propagation of conspiracies on American
soil against Mexico. The consideration
of the operation yf neutrality
laws was not confined to those
of the United States, however. The
American representatives have contended
that Mexico should so govern
her frontier as to make unnecessary
the presence of an American army.
The American commissioners submitted
a list of border raids compiled
by the war department. The
Mexican commissioners "presented another
list specifying instances where
American soldiers or civilians had
crossed the boundary into Mexico
and where Mexicans were said to
have lost their lives and property on
American soil.
More rapid progress towards an
agreement on some plan of border
control is expected to he made now.
Announcement was made today that
reservations have been made at a
hotel in Atlantic City where the conferences
will he continued Monday.
Two more sessions will he held here
hut without I.uis Cabrera, head of
the Mexican commission, who left for
floston today on urgent private business.
The American commissioners studied
today a memorandum submitted
by mining men relative to conditions
in Mexico that they claim make hazardous
the resumption of mining
operations.

INDORSED BY WOMEN
Clemson College. Sept. 2fi.?A
very interesting meeting of the Woman's
club of Clemson College was
held yesterday afternoon in the ladies'
room of the Y. M. C. A. at
which Mrs. Annie I. liemhert of Columbia.
field secretary of State tuberculosis
work, explained in an able
address what was being done to overcome
the ravages of tuberculosis at
the State sanitarium near Columbia.
Owing to the limited accommodations
for men and women, only patients
in the first stages of the disease
are admitted to the sanitarium
and these are kept for a short time
or until they are taught how to care
for themselves.
Mrs. Rembert stated that there
were 2,000 deaths front tuberculosis
in South Carolina last year, and emphasized
the need of a large well
equipped sanitarium to care for the
men, women and children who apply
for aid. The speaker explained that
it W i* U noi * J *
..... ?cLc^iin iur ine tubercular
patients to travel West to obtain
a cure?in fact, by being treated here
the patient can live in South Carolina
afterward.
It is understood that there is a
movement to obtain increased appropriations
for the construction and
maintenance of this greatly needed
larger sanitarium and the support of
every one interested in the tuberculosis
work is requested.
At the close of Mrs. Remhert's address
a motion was made by Mrs. J.
N. Harper that the Woman's club of
('lemson College go on record as indorsing
Ine anti-tuberculosis work as
conducted by the State board of
health and that this work be aided
in every possible way. This is the
first Woman's club in South Carolina
to indorse the State tuberculosln
work.
