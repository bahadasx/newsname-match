Von Bethmann Holhveg, Ger
man Chancellor, Says Fight
Now Is for Defense.
GIVES UP ALL HOPE
Believes Desire for Expand
ing Territory Will Keep
the Struggle Going.
Bj tnltwl Tres.
BERLIN, Sept. 29. Chancellor Von
Bethmann Hollweg's Reichstag's ad
dress placing the blame for the con
tinuance ot the European slaughter
at the doors of Germany's enemies
won enthusiastic approval from the
majority of Reichstag members this
afternoon-
The chancellor made no offers of
peace, and he Indicated that in view
of the recent Allied statements It
would be folly to expect an early end
of the war. His speech lacked the
hopeful tone of his former address.
"The desire for territorial expansion
by cur enemies is responsible for the
daily piling up of the mountains of
corpses," said the chancellor. "The
British leave no doubt as to what
they wish to do. . They wish to crush
out German existence as a nation. A
Germany crushed "economically, de
fenceless from the miliary standpoint,
bojeotted and conjemned to eternal
feebleness that is the Germany Eng
land wishes to see.
"A German statesman who would
hesitate to use against this enemy
(England) every available instrument
that would really shorten the war,"
he said, "such a statesman deserves
to be hanged.
"From the beginning this war has
been for Germany nothing but the
defense of of our rights of life and
liberty," continued the chancellor.
"Therefore Germany decalrei her
readiness for peace terms on Decem
ber 9, 1915, and later on several other
occasions.
"We did our duty, nor does anybody
dare to ask that we make proposals
today, when Mr. Briand a short while
ago said that peace now would be con
sidered as humiliation and the thought
cf peace as a provacation and a dis
grace to the memory of the dead. Our
enemies continue the war because they
hope to reach their Utopian aim."
Hollneg Already Answered.

LONDON', Sept. 29. The War Sec
retary Llod-George's declaration that
the war must be fought to a knock
out, made yesterday through an cx
clushe interview with the United
Press, is Britain's answer to the
speech made by the German Chan
cellor before the Reichstag jestcrday,
London evening papers asserted to
night. "By a single chance DaWd Lloyd
George answered von Hollwcg's
Bpeech before it was made," said the
Etening Standard. "Germany made
this war determined in its character
and now there can be no compromis
ing in the end."
"The German Chancellor has been
ansuered in anticipation by the Lloyd
George interview," said the Westmin
ster Gazette. "The War Secretary
neer spoke with more cxplicitness
nor more nearly in accord with the
mind of the country than in this in
terview "
"If any more proof were needed
that the tables are turned it is afford
ed by a contrast of the two momen
tous statements made by.von Hollweg
and Lloyd-George," says the Globe.

The decision of the administration
not to intervene while It was certain
peace overtures would be acceptable

REPORTS SAY BANDIT
LATEST BATTLE
Carranzista Defeat West of
Chihuahua City Seen in
Meager Accounts.
DEATH LIST IS LARGE
General Ramos, De Facto
Leader, Wounded, Asks
Aid and Tells Losses.
By United Press.
EL PASO, Tex., Sept. 29. In one
cf the bloodiest battles since the
Mexican revolutlons'began, a large
force of Villista bandits engaged de
facto troops on Wednesday at CusI
hlurachlc, fifty miles west of Chihua
hau City. Meager details of the
battle began to seep across the border
tills afternoon. Carranzista officials
at Juarez admit that losses on both
sides ran Into the thousands.
From representatives in that region,
mining men today received messages
indicating that Villa had cantured
the town after part of the garrison
had revolted and Joined the bandit's
forces. It Is reported that Villa, In
person, led his army.
From Carranzista authorities at
Juarez few details are available. It
was said that the only news received
was the message to Chihuahua City
from General Ramos, commanding the
de facto troops engaged, asking that
a hospital train and surgeons be rush
ed to his assistance. Ramos himself
was wounded. Ramos' report added
that 100 Villlstas were killed and that
the dc facto, forces suffered heavy
casualties.
It was pointed out here that Ramos'
laconic report of the battle portended
another victory for the bandits, since
had Carranza's forces been successful
the victory would have been an
nounced immediately.
Later dispatches further indicated
a Villa success. A Mexican manager
of an American-owned mine in the
region telegraphed Chihuahua, saying
he had fled and was coming to Juarez.
It is believed here If the government
forces had been victorious the man
ager would have returned to his mine.

21 PLAN TRADE WEEK
s
Columbia Merchants to Co
Operate in National "Dress
Up" Week.
National Dress Up Week starts the
first of October.
This fact adds emphasis to the Co
cperatlvo Fare-Refund Trade Week
that the merchants of Columbia are
planning for the second week of Oc
tober. Columbia merchants who are
planning special displays for Dress Up
Week will keep them up for the Trade
Week that immediately follows. For
this reason, Trade Week In many ways
will be In the nature of a style show
for Columbia.
More than twenty of Columbia's
leading stores have now signed the
co-cperatlve trade week agreement
to refund railroad transportation and
mileage to every Columbia visitor dur
ing the fare-refund event
Some idea of the business possibili
ties for Columbia of the co-operative
trade week may be gained from ex
periences in other cities . During the
fare rebate week In Sedalia the mer
chants who co-operated in the idea
did a total business of $23,000 with
out of town customers. In Danville,
III., the trade amounted $28,000.
Champaigne, (III., a college town simi
lar to Columbia did $28,000 worth of
business. , Joplin did a gross business
of $30,000, and Springfield last spring
did a business of $28,000 during Trade
Week. These 'figures are accurate and
were compiled from the fare-rebate
slips turned In by the out-of-town
customers at the newspaper offices.
The fact that Trade Week will also
be a home coming week is gaining
emphasis as to the plans for the fes
tival proceed. The suggestion that
persons in Columbia write their
friends to visit them the second week
in October has brought results.
One young man from Paris, Mo.,
yesterday, visited the "Missourian of
fice and asked that his town be In
cluded In the fare-rebate territory,
because he wanted his aprents to visit
him. "And I need some new clothes
too," he remarked as he left the of
fice. "This will -enable my folks to
visit me and get their railroad fare
back at the same time."
Really the most Important thing
about the co-operative trade week, is
the fact that It will do much to
clinch Columbia's position as the
metropolis of a large part ot Central
Missouri. This cannot be done unless
the business men here make definite
plans and offer special inducements
in the matter of fare-refunds and first
class values to show the people in the
trade territory the advantage of mak
ing their purchases here. This ex
plains the reason why so many of Co
lumbia's merchants have united on the
Trade Week idea.
The firms that have Joined .the
Trade Week plans to date are:
Fredendall Depirtment Store.
Victor Barth Clothing Company.
C. B. Sillier Shoe Company.
Will E. Smith Vrv Roods Compinj

Mr. Rymel, who gives his age at 60,
was a resident of Cooper County until -1900,
when he moved to Montana. He ''

a boarding house for nearly all of the
Tiger athletes, when asked her age
merely smiled and said, "I am over

be as easily arranged in the present
stands it was decided to construct
the box for the newspaper men at

telegraph wires, will be run from
the Katy tracks.
The press box will accommodate
twenty correspondents and six tele
graph operators. It will be covered
