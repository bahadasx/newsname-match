(INTERESTING LETTER
FROM SOLDIER BOY
Mr. C. M. Dennis, member cf
Machine Gun company, 1st S. C. infantry,
dated at Camp Stewart, Fort
Bliss, Texas, September 22, 1016,
writes a letter to bis mother, Mrs. P.
JM. Dennis, which is interesting mough
K|j|l to print here in full, as follows:
V We have just arrived in carui from
W the largest parade since 1865. There
WS were 36,000 troops present, including
cavairy, artillery, machine gun comW
pany, infantry land supply trucks?300
suonlv trucks?which made a train of
r ? *
} about three miles. The parade was
20 miles long.
The troops were loaded in trucks
and transported to El Paso and fell
into line beginning at Texas sir et.
We marched down Texas street and I
then up Montanna street. We met the j
last of the column at Ft. Bliss just1
leaving Fort Bliss 10 miles from the.
-n.i+TT tvio tTw%ns were reviewed at;
the FOrt. l\Me arrived at the fort atj
1:30 p. m., and were halted on the'
?
plains. The parade was completed at
6 o'clock and as far as you could see
there were soldiers. Such a thing
has never happened neither in Fort
t>i;^ -r^r. tt*i PnsA in all of their mili
UVi JUf* * v-?v ?
tary career. I
We went in our macl gun trucks
of course and met with much approvement
by the reviewing officers. The
trucks are an experiment, the other
r\n -nor?lr milles.
^'UUO CW VU Jk/?kv?k ?. _
The ladies of the city treated us
fine. They gave us water as we passed,
they had bowls full of ice water
and gave it to us poor thirsty soldiers.
They must appreciate our being
here, I believe.
This 20 mile hike was awful tire- j
some but it was worth it to be in such
a parade.
I have taken Kodak pictures of our j
machine guns in action and of the,
Rio Grande at the International
bridge and some ruins of the bandits
t.hfi border.
This crossing the border is verydangerous.
ou have to get rid of
everything that belongs to United
States and put on civilians clothes,
and rough, ones lat that, and have
nothing that looks like it will shoot.
I haven't the slightest idea -when
we will get back home but I hope to '
se you soon. Write me as soon as
possible.

MtLAlKIN AGREES TO RETAIN

j Columbia. iSept. 26.?State Warehouse
Commissioner McLaurin tonight
stated to the executive committee of
the State Warehouse Association,
when requested to come to their sesi
sion after they had taken action upon
% ' * - J. - J* 5 4--U ~ 4- UA
fns contemplated resignation, cua.i u*
would comply with their request and
remi in i:i the position which he holds.
The committee adopted the follow ins
resolutions:
'That it is our candid judgment that
the real producers of cotton, the pations
of the warehouse svstem, and
the friends of scientific marketing,
ccmmend the administration of this
office by Mr. McLaurin, and. that they
desire that he continue to discharge
the duties of warehouse commissioner
and devote himself to the development
of the same."
President Banks was not able to attend
and was represented by Mr. G. A.
Guignard. He wrote a letter in which
he said that he felt to lose Senator
AIcLaurin to this cause at this time
on account of mere political considerations
would be nothing short of calamity
and. therefore, he earnestlytrusted
that the committee might use
all its power to prevail on him to reconsider
his contemplated action.
"It was the fire of his genius whnh
kindled its light," he said. "His talent
for organization and his enthusias+ic
devotion which has thus far brought
i' on its way." The sentiments expressed
by President Banks were endorsed
by the committee.

faction -to be held in Columbia on
Tuesday, October IS:
"To the Public:
"1 hereby call for a convention of
* hp reform faction of the Democratic
party, to be held on Tuesday, October
3S, in Columbia. During the campaign
just passed, appeals were made 10
'save civilization,' as was done in 1873
when negro domination was the issue.
Men have been heard to justify questionable
methods at the ballot box upon
the same grounds as when dealing
with negroes in 1876, and now it is
up to us, and is our duty, to hold a
great convention and demonstrate thint
we are as good white men as are
those who contemptuously, stigmatize
the bone and sinew of this state a
'Bleaseites,' and for the further purpose
of increasing our fiiith in and
consecrating our enoris to uie wu- j
tinuance of the struggle for the prin- i
cfples upon which we stand. I
"I suggest that each Democratic
club send one true and tried reformer
as delegate to this convention.
