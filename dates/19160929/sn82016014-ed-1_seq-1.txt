PUT UP ORSHUT UP
County Takes o More Chances
in Wife Desertion Cases.
Women Who Complain Against
Husbands Must Give Bond.
SHAWNEE HAS LOST ENOUGH
Reconciliations Ate Into Treas
ury for a Large Amount.
First Trial of Plan 3Iade by
Attorney Lee Today.
In an effort to decrease county ex
penses amounting to hundreds of dol
lars yearly, for wife desertion cases,
wherein, after the husband is arrested,
and many times brought from neigh
boring states at the county's expense,
the wife refuses to prosecute, the coun
ty commissioners inaugurated new
tactics today. They compelled a wom
an i.t. wanted to prosecute her bus
band who is in Nebraska for desertion
to put up bond for "good faith."
The woman, Mrs. Bessie O. Harsh
berger, appeared in the county attor
ney's office today and asked for a war
rant for her husband. Rad Lee, as
sistant, took the matter up with the
county commissioners who decided
that Mrs. Harshberger should put up
a t!0 bond to be forfeited if she re
fused to testify against the .husband
after the state goes to the expense of
catching him mil bringing him back.
Since the wife desertion law was en
acted it has been prolific in piling up
court costs against the state withou.
getting many husbards convicted. The
usual course of a wife desertion case
is that the wife comes to the county
attorney and obtains a warrant. Us
ually the husband is out of town and
many times out of the state. The state
spends a lot of money to bring him
back for trial. Too often, the countv
attorney's office has decided, the wife
visits the husband before the trial.
They make up. He offers to stay at
home and support her if she will not
send him to jail.
I he wife appears before the countv
attorney and asserts she will drop the
case. A wife can not be compelled to
testify against her husband. The
county attorney can do nothing but
dismiss the case and the county must
pay costs.
Harry O. Harshberger, against
whom the warrant was issued toHav
is somewhere in Nebraska, according
to ine wue.

COCOANUT ISLE
Chicago, Sept. 29. John T. Mc

island in the South Atlantic near the
Bahama group. The Island is three
and a half miles long and a little more
than a mile wide, and is down on the

To mariners it is known as Treasure
Island because of th.3 many legends
of buried gold which pirate chieftains
pla ed there in the days when the
rovers of the sea plied their calling.
McCutcheon says he places more
faith in ,the cocoanut trees of which
there are 30.000. than he does in the
tales of buried treasure. And he ex

products of the soil instead of buried

Berlin. Sept. 29. Chancellor Von
Bethmann-Hollwog's reichstag address
placing the blame for the continua
tion of the European slaughter at the
door of Germany's enemies, won en
thusiastic approval from the majority
of the reichstag members today. The
chancellor made no offers of peace,
and he indicated that in view of the
utterances of allied statesmen it would
be folly to expect an early ending cf ,
the war
His speech lacked the hopeful tone ;
of his former addresses.
"The desire for territorial conquest '
by our enemies is responsible for the ,
daily piling up of mountains of i
corpses." said tho chancellor. "The j
Hritish leave no doubt as to wnat tney
wish to do to Germany. They wish to

longer fears German competition,
when France has been bled to death.
when all her allies are slaves of Eng- i
land, when European neutrals must
submit to every British order, the
dream of British supremacy is to be
come a reality.
Teserves To Be Hanged.
"A German statesman ' ho would
hesitate to use against this enemy
(England) every available instrument
that would really shorten the war
such ac statesman deserves to be
hanged."
Ttethmann-Hollweg declared the
central powers have frustrated every
plan of the allies to break Germany's
connections witn. me unw
lng Turkey.
Aside from Isolated allied rfueeesses
on the Somme. the general situation
is unchanged he added.
The war aims of our enemies are
announced without concealment, and
cannot be misinterpeted. Their object
is territorial aggrandizement and our
destruction. They intend to give Con
stantinople to the Russians. Alsace
Lioraine to the French. Trentino to
the Italians and Transylvania to the
Rumanians. But Germany will per
severe until the war ends victoriously."
Denies Humors of laxity.
The chancellor declared his con
temnt for those circulating reports
that all Germany's means of fighting !
were not being employed to the fullest
possible extent. He added that in order j
to disappoint the enemy, "who is on
watch for every breach of our inner I
determination," he would not give de- I
tails. I
"In 1914."' he went on, "we had to'
draw the sword. We knew we had to (
nrntect our hearths and homes against
a mighty and almost overwhelming
coalition. Ardent and until then un
known and often ignored patriotism
flamed up in all hearts defying death
and certain of victory. Today after
two years of fighting, struggling, suf
fering and dying, we know more than
ever before that there is one watch
word, namely persevere and win. We
will win. '
Last winter there was pusillanimous
anxiety as to whether our foodstuffs
would suffice. They have sufficed.
This year's harvest makes us much
more secure than was the case last
year."
The chancellor said that he realized
the troubles of the people coincident
with the war and that he shared the
deep sorrow for the fallen and muti

'"I bow my head," he went on, "be- j

more sublime and still greater is the
defiance of death with which our sons
and brothers in the fields withstand
the violent assaults of the enemy who,
superior in numbers, are fighting with
the utmost bravery. World history

The chancellor declared that the j
German people again had an oppor- i
tunity to show their appreciation of
the tieroism of the army by subscribe
ing to the new war loan. He asserted
that the nation firmly believed in the i
assurance of victory and was ready i
for any sacrifice.
"I also know we can rely on the I
fighters behind the front, he said, "to '
give all their available money to sup- ,

Oscar Dudley of Hutchinson won cit

Several years ago Dudley went to

He had been convicted on two forgery

complications, Dudley told Judge C.
W. Smith, executive clerk, and the

to marry and the woman of his
dreams declared she was willing to
help steer Dudley along a straight and
narrow path.
Dudley walked Into the governor's
office today with his bride to-be. He
walked right into Governor Capper's
private office.
"I want citizenship papers, gover
nor," explained Dudley. "I want to
get married. I have only twice more
to report and I have been a good citi
zen. You can ask any of the people
in Hutchinson who know me."
Introduces the Woman.
The governor thought Dudley ought
to talk the matter over with Judge
Smith, executive and pardon clerk.- So
Dudley walked to Judge Smith's of
fice. There he told his story all over
again.
"Where is the woman you are going
to marry?" asked Smith.
"I'll get her," said Dudley. "She's
right out here. I want you to see her,
anyway."
So Dudley walked back to the long
room where visitors to the governor's
office await their turn to see the state
executive. Mrs. Brown soon to be
Mrs. Dudley walked into the 'parole
office. She blushed and smiled and
gave -Dudley a shy sidelong glance
when Judge Smith asked if the couple
expected to- be married.
"You know all about this man's
past?" asked Judge Smith.
"Oh,, yes. indeed," replied Mrs.
Brown. "We've lived next door neigh
bors for a long time. I know all about
his trouble."
"And you are willing to marry him
and live with him and be happy?"
queried the executive clerk.
She Wan W illing.
"I certainly am," was the em
phatic reply of tha rather attractively
dressed w-oman who was soon to be
come a bride.
"You see. there were extenuating
circumstances about the case." ex
plained Dudley. "I was only part
guilty at most."
"Evei in trouble before?" asked
Judge Smith.
"No, sir. That's the first and last
time."
Dudley looked right in the eyes of
the executive clerk as he talked. Sud
denly he seemed to remember that his
name might be associated with the man
who was the victim of the recent
Johnson county lynching.
"I'm not related to that scoundrel
who was lynched by the mob down at
Olathe, ' explained Dudley. "I've
lived in Hutchinson sixteen years and
anyone down there can tell you all
about me."
Then Dudley explained that he is
employed in a straw board factory.
He is 45 years old and & bachelor.
Judge Smith could see no reason why
the state ehould stand between Dud
ley anJ a realization of his dream of
bliss. So the man received citizen
ship papers.
."We're going right to the court
house and get married," said the
near-bridegroom. "We'll be on our
way to Texas on a honeymoon before
night. Thank you. Good-bye."
Dudley and his love were out the
dor and headed straight for the pro
bate judge's office.
