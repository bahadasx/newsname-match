Early in the evening the convention
assembled for a Gold Medal contest.
Seven contestants acquitted themselves
very honorably. There were six ladies
and one young man, Mr. Percy Ed
../ards of Oelwein who in every respect
worthily won the medal.
Sunday was really a feast of good
things. First the church service and
a delightfully ^inspiring sermon by the
pastor of the church, Rev. D. C. Perry,
set the key note for the day.
The convention held a platform meet
ing in the afternoon, presided over by
the President, Mrs. Flower. Excellent
addresses were given by Mr. Foster
Hughes, a young man of Lime Springs
and Mr. R. H. Waters of Waukon.
Both these gentlemen discussed the
liquor problem from the economic and
moral standpoint and the necessity for
National Prohibition. Mr. Hughes
suggested the necessity of memoraliz
ing congress to protect Iowa from the
shipment of liquor into our state from
Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois. A
resolution was passed by the conven
tion for the presentation of such me
morial through the State W. C. T. U.
Sunday evening Rev. Caldwell con
ducted the devotions after a happy ser
vice of song led by Rev. Perry.
Mrs. L. D. Carhart, State Cor. Secy.,
gave a helpful address. This was fol
lowed by the presentation by Mrs.
Flower of a handsomely framed pic
ture of Frances E. Willard to the High
School of Lime Springs which was re
ceived by the superintendent of schools.

The following resolution was pre
sented and unanimously endorsed by
the delegates and a large audience,
which filled the entire church.
"Resolved, by-the 23rd Dist. of the
W. C. T. U. of Iowa in convention as
sembled at Lime Springs, that we here
in voice our protest against the election
of W. L. Harding to the responsible
position of Governor of the State of
Iowa, because of the stand he hts
taken in the Senate against all temper
ance legislation and in opposition to all
questions involving the moral welfare
of the Commonwealth."
Signed by the Committee.
Rural School Notes.
The schools of Vernon Springs^ Town
ship are very much pleased this £all
with the large wall pictures receded
as the premium for the best exhibit at
the Farmers' Institritp last winter.
Sixteen dollars was turned over by the
Institute for a premium to be given to
each school in the township. As it was
difficult to get the teachers together to
make a choice of the premium, the
decision was not made in time to put
the pictures into the schools in the
spring. Districts four and five had
some money earned by sociables which
they offered to use with their share of
the premium money for oil stoves for
the work in domestic science. The
other districts preferred the pictures,
and picture study leaflets for eac£
school. Following is the account:
District 4—Stove $ 1.75
District 5—Stove 1.75
C. M. Parker—Study Leaflets 2.00

The Conference adopted the follow
ing resolutions concerning the candi
dacy of W. L. Harding^ the republican
candidate for governor.'' p:
"Whereas, It seems clear to the
members of this Conference that the
record of W. L. Har.ding in public life
shows him to be out of harmony with
the attitude of the state on the whole
en the temperance question, as ex
pressed in the platforms of both par
ties.
And because it seems incredible that
any man will as governor support and
further a cause to enforce laws that he
has fought and opposed with all his
power as a legislator.
And because to elect any man gov
ernor who has opposed moral reform is
to reward a treacherous policy with
public approval and honor.

HIGHLY IMPORTANT—" The Birth of a Nation" will never be presented at any but High Clafs Theaters and at Prices Customarily in such Piayhouscs.—D. W, GRIFFITH.
•ivi V-. MitfUn
Be it resolved, that the record of the
D. W. GRIFFITH'S EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD
present candidate for governor of the
republican party has been so consistent,
persistent and continuous in its hos
tility to temperance that there is not
and never has been any question where
he stood on the prohibition question.
Because his record is well known and
undisputed we are convinced that his
election would be accepted everywhere
as a victory for the liquor interests.
Therefore, be it resolved, That we as
ministers of the truth, members of the
Upper Iowa Conference, would be trait
ors to our trust if we kept silence, and
unworthy successors to the prophets of
old, if we did not frankly and openly
condemn the candidacy of this nominee.
We believe that this nominee is en
titled to and will receive the votes of
all supporters of the liquor traffic re
gardless of party lines. So we believe
that all who are opposed to the liquor
traffic, regardless of party lines, should
vote for the opposing candidate, a man
whose legislative record and well known
public attitude is uniformly opposed to
the liquor interests.
We do this with no desire to change
the party allegiance of any man but to
call on all lovers of righteousness to
place principles above party and public
record above vagu* promises.
To Our Advertisers.
Every week during the past few
weeks we have been compelled on ac
count of lack of space to refuse adver
tising handed us on publication day or
the day previous. The extraordinary
high price of print paper makes the
printing of supplements rather un
profitable, and while we would do it to
accommodate our advertisers, we need
some time to arrange for and print the
supplements—it can't be done the day
we go to press. If you want an adver
tisement in the Plain Dealer, make
sure of it by arranging early for the
space.

Horrors of the Reconstraction in dw
Birth of a Nation.
The period of the reconstruction so
vividly brought back to the memory
of thoss who may have gone through
it and reproduced afresh for those new.
er generations who now view it for the
first time, in Griffith's Birth of a Na
tion, shows the time of Johnson's ad
ministration-and he, as the nation's, ex
ecutive, in the hands of ring of poli
ticians and power seekers, who are
manipulating the affairs of the south to
suit their own ends. It turns to the
ruins of the flower decked* South Caro-.
lina village of ante bellum days, the
place where the blacks were light heart
ed and care free, even under the bonds
of slavery, turns back to the town that
by war has been left half in ruins, the
streets grass grown, the stately man
sions of the old days tottering and
crumbling, to a town where those once
wealthy now are in direst poverty
where the "black is a good as a white
man," as was the slogan of the north
ern men of the Lynch and Stoneman
tpye. Women are menaced by the
black minions of the northern whites,
or are attacked, whites are driven from
the streets, menaced by the colored
troops, or assaulted. Homes are in
vaded. Justice is a forgotten thing.
The land knows no law but that con
ceived by the race then in control. Then
the chivalry of the whites is given new
life. TheKuKlux Klan is formed. These
riders of the. night, in ghostly white,
rally by dozens, by scores and hund~
reds and thousands. They ride like
the wind. They strike without even
the warning the rattlesnake gives, but
are far more deadly. This, all won
derful, soul stirring, breath-taking a»
it is, is but another of the innumerable
"dramas within dramas" of which The
Birth of a Nation consists.
This glorious spectacle is to be given
here in its entirety, with its accom
panying symphonyjorchestra, its effects
paraphernalia and its trained mechanic
ians tor that purpose and is to be pat
on here in the same fashion down to
the smallest detail that amazed New
York and the other cities.
