Make Happiness a Business
be blue Its silly
Dont bo sad its wrong
Take life willy nilly
With laughter and with song
The nerves break down from worry
TJie heart grows weak with care
Away the troubles scurry
When the light and love are there
Make happiness a business
That other business then
Will rise from out Its shadows
And win success again
Let skies be blue above you
Not you be blue below
And all the world will love you
As off the troubles go
Baltimore Sun
SOWING 8EEDS THAT GROW
Sowing- seeds sowing seeds
They may bo words they mtCy be deeds
They may be wheat they may lie corn
They may be blpssoms which adorn
The brier or the fruitful tree
The cllmblnsr vine the fragrant pea
The fields of timothy or clover
Inspiring every nature lover
With thoughts of beauty love and truth
The Blory of old ace or youth v
That beautifies the mind and home
rpr generations yet to come
To live and love the Urines that are
In spirit and in seed and lower
In everything that doth aitse
To Natures blessed paradise
