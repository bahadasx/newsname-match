G. 0. P. NOMINATES
COUNTY CANDIDATES
AT A CONVENTION
HELD IN DEMING
Nominate a Ticket far all Coun
ty Offices With Exception of
County Clerk Pennington to
Oppose Stump fbr Ascssor.
At the republican county con
vention held In Doming Satur
day a ticket was nominated
to oppose the democratic can
lidates for the county offices.
No one seemed to care to muke
the race for clerk nirainst C. II.
Hughes for County Clerk. The
delegates from Columbus suc
ceeded in Retting two men on
the ticket from this end of the
county. S. C. Pierce of Sunnysidc
stands at the head of the county
ticket, having been unanimously
nominated for the office of. rep
resentative to the legislature.
E. Engendorf was also unani
mously nominated for the office
of commissioner from the second
district. Bbth these men are
well known in this section and
will no doubt greatly strengthen
the republican ticket in the fall
election.
The delegates from Columbus
who attended the convention in
Deming were J, R. Blair, E. En
gendorf, Henry Burton and P.
K. Lemon, Jr. The republicans
seemed to be divided at first,
but the differences were finally
adjusted nnd all became very en
thusiastic. The large numoer
of voters in Columbus who have
never voted in the county before
will cause the candidates some
worry at lenst, and it is possible
that the Columbus vote will af
fect a change in the final result
in November.,
The Republlcnnticket as nom
inated is as follows:
REPRESENTATIVE
S. C. Pierce
TREASURER
Wm. W .Barracks
ASSESSOR
Edward W. Pennington
SHERIFF
Harry V. Whitehill
SUPERINTENDENT

WARS THAT CREATED WORDS
Mrs. R. P. Johnson returned
to Columbus last Saturday af
ter an absence of several weeks.
She spent a part of her time vis
iting with her daughter at Ar
tesia, New Mexico.
Forlorn Hope" li a Military Phratc
That Wat Borrowed From
the Dutch.
"Kultur" is n word which hits
found its way into the English Ian
gunge. Everybody seems' -to -know''
that thcro ia a difference between
"culture" and "kultur" and a dif
ference not merely of spelling.
Utir siiteenth-opnturv war with
Spain was responsible for mjveral
new word being added to (lie lan
guage. "Embargo and "contra
band are two of them, while to onr
campaigns in the low countries we
or! indebted for such words a "free
booter," "furlough," 'cashier,"
"leagues," "drill." "onslaught,"
"sconce" and "domineer."
'Forlorn hope" is a military
phrase borrowed from the Dutch
"verloren hoop," hoop meaning
troop; and although "comrade"
o Spanish word, it came to
through the soldiers who fought in
the low countries.
The word "khaki" was not iikI
in the way it i today until the Hoer
war. The term "die-hards" came
from the battle of Alburn in 1811
when Colonel lnglis, addressing his
men, cried, "Die hard, my lads ; die
hard!"
The term "free lance," now mean
ing a literary man who is in no one's
cinulov. i a relic of the Crusudfi
when companies of knights roved
from place to place, offering their
service to anyone who would pay 101
them. Answers, lxmdon.

Tuesday night. October 3rd, at

one of the best, cleanest and
fastest bouts that was ever seen"
in Columbus a few weeks ago
and the return match promises
to be one with fight all the way

men giving them from fifteen to
forty pounds in weight and has
won five by knockout route in
less thnn three rounds each.'vith
a credit of two good draws in
the other bouts.

best men in tho east. His home
is in Chicago, but he is now a
member of Troon I.lZth Lav
nlry and is now stationed at Hn-
chitn, N. M. The second oout

called upon his fellows to join
him m giving the driver and
team a lift, but when the load
was started there was not a
word of thankB from the driver;
he did nat even look toward his
