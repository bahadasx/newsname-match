NOT FORCED BY
SUDDEN crisis
Hughes Refutes Wilson Argu
ment by Quoting Corre
spondence on Measure.
SARATOGA. N. Y.. Sept. 23?Ab
solutely contrndictlng the president-*
assertion that "a sudden crisis" had
come about In the Adamson wage
fixing bill situation, and that the:
crisis had to bo met in the only wayi
possible, Mr. Hughes brought into'
the case a yiass of correspondencej
from the Chnmbers of Commerce of j
thr United States to the president
and tn the chairman of the senate j
committee, going back to /s far as
July 29, and appealing for an Investi
gation of the facts before forcing leg
islation.
Mr. Hughes laid emphasis upon
two points: That this correspond
ence alone was enough to that there
was no "sudden crisis." and also to
prove that there was a widespread
and earnest demand that the Inter
state Commerce Commission go
thoroughly Into the controversy be
tween the railroads and the broth
erhoodfc before any legislation was
had.
invades Wilson's Stnto.
Mr. Hughes came into New Jersey
and got right down to business by ap
pearing before a big crowd at the In
terstate fair In Trenton. As else
where Republicans and Progressives
composing the Grand Old Party sat
on the platform at the fair grounds
side by side and smiling amiably.
The Jerseymen wore quite obvious
ly showing Mr. Hughes that the re
cent primaries had left bo hard feel
ings. Joseph Frellnghuysen, the
successful candidate for ITnlted
States senator, was careful to shake
hands a lot of times with Franklin
Murphy whome he defeated, and
Walter K. Hdge, who beat AuBten
Colgate tor the gubernatorial nomi
nation. paid a lot or attention to Mr.
Colgate.
The affair was successful, although'
the management Foemod to do Its
best to make the morning disagree
able to Mr. Hughes. The locnl com
mitteemen.'apparently unable to!
stand up under the honors they werei
carrying, lost their heads and issued I
n lot of silly orders to tho polcle.
The police got excited and started to
shove. Suddenly the ticket olltcoi
boosted the price of admission, fig
uring that Charles K. Hughes was a
rattling good attraction and could be I
had only onco.
\ lews Forcibly Presented.
The air resounded with the plaints!
of Jorecymen. However, these vexa- j
Hons could not divert Mr. Hughes
from the business that brought him'
to the big fair. He got his views be-1
fore tho big crowd rapldlv and force.?
fully. He went strong on the tari.fi
argument, and strong, too, upon his'
Americanism declaration, saying: I
"We are desirous of maintaining1
our rights; the malntcnace of Ameri
can rights with respect to life, prop-1
erty and commerce will not endanger
our peace and security. We want to,
d-serve the nspect of all nations in
stead of inviting resentment and serl-'
ous difficulties."
He bore down pretty hard on the
Adamson bill, which lie has been
making an effective weapon. He;
branded it as a misrepresentation
from first to last. He said:
"I am not oppored to the principle
of nn eight-hour day. but I am op
posed to calling a bill an eight-hour
oay hill 'when It Is not an eight-hour1
day bill at all. but a wage bill. 1 am
not opposed to increased wages that
are Justified by the facts. I am op
posed to any legislation in the ab-!
sence of knowledge of the facts. I]
am opposed to a surrender to a show
of rorce. Stand for principle and the
whole American nation will back the
man that does It."
At New York Convention.
Mr. Hughes left Trenton about
12:JO p. ni. and airived In- Jersey
City In the early afternoon. His spe
cial train was Bwltched from the
track of the Pennsylvania railroad to
the West Shore and went on its way
to up-state, passing through Albanv
at a few minutes after 7 o'clock anil I
arriving here one hour later
This morning Mr. Hughes began a
two days' speech-making tour In
northern New York. He Is sched-|
uleil to mako twenty-seven speeches
? but the importunl-!
ties of important persons will get tho
schedule Increased somewhat and
Mr. Hughes may be expected to de
liver about thirty speeches. His night
meetings and long addresses will bo
int Ilomell tonight and at Buffalo
Saturday night.

Four Big Organizations in
Huntington and Another
Fine One in Fairmont.
Campaign clubs have boon organ-'
lied or aro being organized In even
county in tho state. This work was
started by Charles G. CoHman, ??o-!
retary of the Republican state com-1
mlttee, and is being done In each
county under the direct supervision;
of the county chairman. This plan j
of organization has bet with groat
success. It has met with popular fa
vor overywhore.
"There will be more active, enthu
siastic Republican campaign clubs
this year than ever before In the his
tory of politics In tho state," said
Secretary Coffman today. "This plan
or organization haB "caught on' ev
erywhere, and there will not be a
county In the stato which will not
have at leaBt ono big, determined,
enthusiastic club composed of active
party hustlers.
"I am just In receipt of a letter
from Raleigh county which reports
fine success In carrying out a plan to
organize thirty-one Republican clubs,
ono In each precinct. There aro four
big clubB In Huntington, one of them
a Rbblnson-Lllly club, another of,
over 1,000 members in Marion coun
ty. A new club has been launched I
at Salem, and a fine one at Grafton j
with a boyB* drum corpB. Fairmont
Republicans to the number of over
1,000 have joined the bandwagon |
chorus. These are just a few sam
ples of the club organization, whlcn i
has been taken up with such fine en-1
thUBlasm by our voters everywhere.
Tho list of clubs already Is a lengthy
and growing one. The work Is being
carried forward In all parts of tho
state with an earnestness and activ
ity which Is decidedly encouraging to
the officials at state headquarters. It
Is Indicative of the fact that the Re
publicans of West Virginia are arous
ed and determined to win a great
victory at the polls this year."
