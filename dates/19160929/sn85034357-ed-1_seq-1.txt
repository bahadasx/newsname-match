STATEMEETING
OF W. C. T. ?.
Annual State Meeting in Session
Here This Week?36 Coun?
ties Have Representatives
Here?Adjourn Tonight.
The State Convention of the Wo
m&n's Christian Temperance Union,
met in the New Theatre Tuesday ev?
ening, according to appointment, at
8 o'clock. The auditorium and the
gallery was filled by delegates and
visitor* and presented a --leasing and
inspiring appearance.
Tho sU.ge was beautifully draped
with new curtains and potted plants
and flowers, and tho beauty of the
scene was the subject of unanimous
remarks.
Pronrptiy at 8:15, Mrs. Howard M.
H?ge, President of the Association,
opened the proceedings by announc?
ing the song, "The Fight is On,''
which was sung by the audience, led
by a lai'tce choir, accompanied by in?
strumental music, with Miss Ellie
Bowen at the -iano.
The Tazewell quartette, composed
of M. J. Hnnkins, H. S. Surface, C.
W. St;clc and Bane C. Peerv and Mrs.
A. S. liijrjjinbtoham rendered fineJ
selections.
Rov. lt. B. Plait read the eleventh
chapter of Hebrew; and offered pray?
er.
The program of this "Welcome
Service" was carried out. Senator
Royall spOKO for the . Southwest:
Mayor Hawthorne for the town; Rev.
Mr. Bullsrd for the churches; Prof.
J. B. Mcrtin for the schools; Rev. Mr.
Brown for the Anti-Saloon League:
Mrs. Sn!;ie Harrissoh for the local
W. C. T. U. All these addresses of
welcome were in the very best of
taste, and wero heartily apnlauded.!
The response was made by Mrs, W.
?. Maybee, of Richmond, in a forceful
address, gracefully delivered.
The speakers of the evening were
all at their best. Some of the speak?
ers were quite naturally seized with
more or less "stage fright," but this
soon "wore off," and th' warmed i'i
as they "proceeded with their re?
marks." j
Everybody felt proud of everybody, j
tit the brilliant opening of the great
convention. A high key was struck
and a high standard set for all future
meetings.
The convention adjourned at 10
o'clock, to meet Wednesday morning
at 10 o'clock in the Presbvtorian
church.
THE DECORATIONS.
No report of the convention uro- '?
feedings would be complete which
omitted the splendid decorations of,
the buildings where the convention
held its meetings. A glance at this
ornamental work shows exquisite
taste, as well as a great amount of
work on the part of the decoration
committee.
The Presbyterian church, where
the day meetings were held, was elab?
orately ornamented. The letters "W.
C. T. U." in white chrysanthemums,
on a green buck ground, stretched
across and above the organ alcove.
Janonicas, dahlias, and other fall
flowers, ornamented other parts of
the sacred edifice.
The word, "Welcome," also wrought
in white flowers, was the first obiect
Been on entering the vestibule. The
decorations were beautiful all the way
ihrough. The New Theater, with its
new curtain., potted plants, and Sep?
tember flow?rs, presented a pleasing
sight, while the varied colored elec?
tric globes flung a softened glow
of mellow light, like the glow of a
golden sunset upon the faces of the
distinguished men and comely women
upon the stage.
More beautiful and inspiring was
the delegates and members of the
W. C. T. U. themselves?women
whose consecrated and heroic efforts
in and devotion to, a great cause ex?
tends as far as the sun doth shine,
nnd whose influence is destined to be
felt in "Every Land."
The business houses in town, in
eluding the school building, were, as a
rule, decorated with flags and bunt?
ing, all giving the town a gala ap?
pearance, in honor of our distinguish?
ed guests.

rived on the 3 p. m. train Tuesday

A special feature of this session
was the address of Mrs. O'Keeffe,
who spoke for the United Daughters
of the Confederacy. She always
speaks well, and on this occasion was
at her best, and "brought down the
house," with her enthusiasm, cmpha
sized with a Confederate flag, which |
she wave:! aloft.
An unique feature of this meeting
was "The March of the Local Presi?
dents," and also the introduction of j
distinguished delegates end faternal
delegates. "The March of the Preai-1
dents," was an interesting feature
of this session. The lady Presidents |
passed in review before the conven?
tion, made their little Bcpcoches, tell?
ing of what had been done, und bow?
ed gracefully and passed on.
WEDNESDAY EVENING.
The evening session was scheduled
as "Jubilee Night." The meeting
was held in the New Theater and
standing room was at a premium.
Rev. J. N. Harmon conducted the
opening exericcs.
The President's address was the
chief feature. Mrs. H?ge read from
manuscript, giving an interesting re?
port of the fight of the W. C. T. U. for
statewiile prohibition, inaugurated in
1008, showing what had been accom?
plished in the State, and taking a
wider sweep, recounted the progress
of the work in the United States, and
forecasting a "saloonlesa nation"
sooner or later?not later than 1?20,
and urging upon the convention untir?
ing work.
Mrs. Hoge's address wae a com?
prehensive review of t'.ie W. C. T. U.
and Anti-Saloon League work in the

that Will vote this fall and winter
on statewide prohibition. The speak?
er, who was the legislative agent of
the W. C. T. U., and who was present
during the session of the legislature
of the past winter, reviewed the work
accomplished in that body for temper?
ance, and paid a tribute to Senator
Rovall of Tazewell., whom she said
had stood by the W. C. T. U. during
his entire term of office, both in the
lower and upper branch of the legis?
lature.
Mrs. Hoge's address will be -rinted
by the organization and distributed
nmong its members throughout the
SUite.
MRS. AMY C. WEECH.
A striking feature of the evening
was the address of Mrs. Weech, who
took the offering. She dilTorcd from
Mr. Ilarman, who told the conven?
tion that their "work was about done"
by snying that their work had only
fairly begun. The enforcement of the
prohibition laws was more important
and porhnps more difficult, she said,
than the securing of their passage in
the beginning.
Mrs. Weech injected the only polit?
ical hint heard up to this time, in the
convention. "I wonder," she said,
"how many of the men in this com?
munity, in this prohibition county,
will cast their votes for the prohi?
bition candidnte for President?" or
words to that effect. Hor nddress was
one of the chief "hits" of the even?
ing. There were songs by tho choir
and the quartette, and two solos by
Mrs. Judge Frank Maynard, of Blue
field.
At 10 p. m. the convention ndjourn

AFTERNOON SESSION
The program for the afternoon em?
braced an address by Mrs. T. II. Lyon,
litt; conduct of the regular meeting,
Mrs. E. P. Allgood, on Collection of
Dues; Special Funds and Winning
Members, by Mrs. Clement, and Mrs.
Newton, respectively. Other ad?
dresses on how to successfully man?
age and prosecute the work of the
local unions, were made: The ad?
dress of Mrs. Weech, on Looking
ahead, was thrilling and inspiring.
She spoke her full time and then some
?was "rung down, but not run down,"
she said.
One speaker said, "it is claimed that
a certain favorite prescription cures
weak women, but National prohibition
will cure weak men."
CONVENTION ECHOES.
Strange to say, there was less con?
versation heard on the street this
week than usual.
The Sergeant says, "nothing doin' "
this week. 'Believe I'll go fishin'."
Every delegate had the best, home
and every home the best delegate.
They were from the mountains of
Scott and Lee, to the Tennessee and
North Carolina lines, to the sea
bathed shores and peanut districts of
the East, with Richmond, Peters?
burg, Lynchburg, Charlottcsvillc, and
Roanoko, and all the rest included,
and a line looking, well dressed, bus?
iness like "bunch" they were ami
they will be missed after today.
There were about thirty-six coun?
ties represented ? each delegation
seated together, their space marked
off by a placard on which the name
of the county was printed.
The convention was much more or?
derly, quiet und decorous than a sim?
ilar convention run by men. Rut, nat?
urally, there is less freedom anil flex?
ibility.
The ladies were tired and worn out
?some of them?when thoy reached
Tazewell, having travelled all night
before. At least one of the sisters
took a good., long nap in the meeting
on Tuesday night. When .something
aroused he she looked all around and
smiled, as much as to say "I don't, be?
lieve anybody saw me."
Some one remarked that, ninety
per cent of the women of the conven?
tion have gray hair, or hair streaked
with grey., and not. a freakish-dress?
ed one in the crowd?nor a baldhead
ed one.
Sergeant Thompson has kept the
streets of Tazewell "shining" this
week in honor of our distinguished
guests, lie greatly assisted the bi?
llies in decorating the church and the
picture show; in fact, the ladies said
if it had not been for the services of
the Sergeant and J. F. Alexander,
the work of decoratini? could not
have been accomplished.
Sixty-two counties of the 100 in
the State, have unions, !l(i only of
which were represented in the con?
vention. There are 251) local unions
in the State.
The convention was easily enter?
tained and no home way crowded, and
there were a number of vacancies on
the list of the entertainment com?
mittees. Tnzewell "measured up" all
right.
Falls Mills was well represented in
the convention by Mr and Mrs. I.
II. Harry, Mrs. J. IL Shumate, Mrs.
Server, Mrs. Bryant, Mrs. Tabor, and
Mrs. Crutchfield.
It was noticed with some surprise
and regret that Bntctourt was not
represented along with other coun?
ties of the State. Pity this, one of
the finest of them all should come
up missing.
GOOD-BYE.
In bidding the ladies of t'.'.c W. C.
U -oodbye, this paper is sure that
it speaks for the entire community
in saying that we are more than glad
to have had the W. C. T. U. here,
and hang the latch strip on the out?
side should the convention desire to
come our way again.
It has been a great pleasure, in?
deed, an honor also, to entertain so
large a body of Virginia's uplendid
women, first for their own snkes ant*
then for the sake, of the great cause
to which they arc devoting their
lives. Our whole people will feel a
greater interest henceforth in the.
work of the W. C. T. U.
If there was a fear on the part of
some that the entertainment of so
large a body of women could not be
easily and satisfactorily accomplished
in so small a town as Tazewell, we
know now that that fear was ground?
less. The convention has been easily
and pleasantly entertained, and many
moro could nave found a welcome
and good homes. Sensible, Christian
people, are always easily entertained.
These mothers and daughter.: of Vir?
ginia have been a blessing and a ben?
ediction in the homes in which they
have sojourned amongst us. We re?
call a little couplet of our boyhood
days, sometimes made to do good,
work, which may be applicable to
Tazcwcll's feelings towanls the con?
vention, "If you love me like I love
you, no knife can cut our knife in
too."
Good speed and happy and safe re?
turn to your homes! So say we all!
Just a word of congratulation. Be?
yond all question the program of the
convention was one of the most com?
prehensive and complete programs
which we recall after years of expe?
rience and observation, and carried
through in the most admirable and
pleasant manner, due to the tact,
wisdom and ability of the distin?
guished presiding officer, Mrs Howard
IM. H?ge.
I Once more, not Farewell, but Good
bve!

[ Bishop Atkins Will Preside at
Ninety-Third Annual Sess?
ion in Bluefield?Tazewell

?lames Atkins of Waynesville, N. C.,
will preside. Bishop Atkins was born
in 1850 and was ordnincd in 1900. He
is an original Ilolston preacher and
is, therefore, well and favorably
known In this conference, though his
firsl visit among us as presiding!
Bishop.
Tins is expected to be n most
intcnettting conference. Some -100
preachers, delegates anil visitors are
likely to attend and all are. looking
forward dp a lllOSl pleasant stay in
Bluofiuld. Following the usual order
Bishop thins will open the confer?
ence VV.t.acsday morning promptly ill
nine o'clock with dcvolionnl exercises.
Without the organ the historic song
by Charles WesTov beginning,
"And are we yet alive
And buc ench other's face?
Glory and praise to Jesus give
For bis redeeming grace."
and ending
"Let us take up the cross
Till we the crown obtain,
And gladly reckon all things loss
So we may Jesus gain,"
will be sung to the tune, "Blest Be
the Tie That Binds." The Bishop
will read and expound u selected pas?
sage of Scripturc and plead in pray?
er. Then the former secretary, Rov.
James A. Burrow, presiding elder of
the Chattanooga district, will call the
roll. The majority of the preachers
will answer present, since the most of
them will leach Bluefield Tuesday
night. Dr. Burrow Is likol ? to be re
elected Secretory with Rov. E. A.
Sliugnrt, presidint* elder of the Cleve?
land district, assistant. Three othel
members of the conference will be
elected statistical secretaries, One
item after another concerning organ?
ization will be "uickly disnosed of in
its order and the conference will lake
up the various questions und matters
of importance at every successive
meeting throughout the week. Thus
the mornings will bo spent. The af?
ternoons will be devoted to the meet?
ings of the cabinet, conviwsed of the
Bishop and the ten presiding eldci'SJof
standing committees, various confer?
ence boards and examining commit?
tees. At. a chosen hour some one of
the visiting nronchcra will preach
at Grace church every afternoon. The
evening services will be interesting
and profitable since at. these meet?
ings vital interests of the church
will he discussed by the; ablest speak?
ers obtainable.
Sunday, October -Ith, will be an
eventful day. At nine o'clock a Love
Feast will be conducted at Grace
church bv one of the veteran preach?
ers, probably by Rev. J. S. W. Neal.
Everybody is invited. The church
will lie filled and at. the ilpuoilltcd
hour the doors will be locked and no
one admitted until after the service.
This is according to custom of many
years standing. At eleven o'clock
ftishop Atkins will preach at Grace
Church and preachers who have pass?
ed their examinations and have been
traveling preachers two years will
be ordained deacons. The Bishop is one
of the most forceful and eloquent
Hi shops of the church and (hose who
hear him will be highly edified. Prac?
tically all the Other pulpits of the
city will be occupied by leading
preachers of the Methodist church
at both morning and evening service.
Either at Bland Street church or
Grace church the preachers who have
been ordained elders, have passed
their examinations and have been,
traveling preachers for two years
will b ordained elders after a sermon
preached by some one appointed by
the conference committee on public
worship.
The appointments of nroachors for
the ensuing year are generally read
by the Bishop tin; following Monday,
but it is suggested that they will
be read either Sunday night or early
Monthly morning this year, because
Bishon Atkins has another confer?
ence to hohl the following Wednesday
in n distant Slate. There are likely
lo be many changes. Five presid?
ing elders and seventeen pastors will
have served the regular four years
und must be given another field of ac?
tion. Among those nffected by "the
four voar limit" are Rev. I). I*. Hur?
ley, presiding eltler of the Tazewell
district; Rev. H. B. Brown pastor of
I he Elk Garden choree; Rov. J. B,
Ward, presiding ehler of the Bluefield
district; Rev. J. M. Carter, astor of
Grace church and host of the confer?
ence; Rev. W. M. Patty, naslor of the
Abingdon circuit; formerly of Taze?
well circuit; Dr. J. P. Martin, presid?
ing elder of the Big Stone Gun dis?
trict and at one time pastor of the
Tazewell station; Rev. T. S, Hamil?
ton, pastor of the Trinity Church, of
Chattanooga' Dr. George R. Stuart,
pastor of Church Street church, of
Knoxvillo, and Rev. J. A. Burrow, pre?
siding eitler of the Chattanooga dis?
trict anil editor of the Midland Meth?
odist.
Speculation is rife ns to the suc?
cessor of Rev. D. P. Hurley, who has
lived in Tazewell for four years. This
is' Brother Hurley's first quardenium
in the office he now has anil he has
made a splendid record. He has]
shown constant interest in all depart?
ments of church activity and his milli?
ner of dealing with nil questions has
shown marked ability. He is known
and spoken of by all his preachers
and church members and b" the gen?
eral public us a man of courage
fine spirit anil character without hy?
pocrisy. His able sermons and the
Christian spirit he has exhibited in
nil relations have endeared him to
lie hearts of all ami a feeling of re
grct grips one as the hour approach?
es which will remove him to another
(?eld of tluty and opportunity. His
fife, Mrs. Hurley, has exercised
abiding influence for good in the Sun?
day School, the church, the Missionary
, Society, among the young people and
j in the community, since she has been
!a willing, efficient ami tireless par
ticipnnt in all good movements. Each
of tho six children have their indi?
vidual nooks ami corners in the hearts
nf all the people and they will carry
with them the best of wishes for full
success in tho sphere for which their
inestimable qualities of character
and abundant energies lit them.
Where Brother Hurley will go or
who will be his successor are mat?
ters of speculation, but it is conli
idonnly felt that he will be transferred
Ito a place commensurate with his
abilities, most probably to one of
the districts made vacant by the four
year limit.
The people of Tazewell and vicinity
are expected to attend the conference
as much as possible und since the dis?
tance is short and automobiles are
plentiful the trip will be easy and de?
lightful. One may leave Tazewell by
"i :?".() in the moraine; and be proyonl
at. tin1 opening session, mid, staying
the entire day, nach home that night
by 10:30 or 11 o'clock. The general
public is cordially invited tu attend
.ill open sessions of the conference.

BODY OF COL.
TRIMBLE MOVED
Remains of Confederate Officer,
Almost Forgotten, Now liest
lleside Comrade in the New
Cemetery.
On Saturday, the 10th inst., th?
friends of Colonel Edwin Trimble ex?
humed his remains und bore them to
the Mnple Shade cemetery of our
town, wnirh is a beautiful and com?
paratively new one. His remains were
re-interred close to those of Colonel
William Brown, who was ulso disin?
terred and ro-buriod there several
years ago. While there was no mark
whatever placed on the grave of Col?
onel Trimble, who was buried in the
graveyard of his ancestors, about)
four miles west, of town, yet hia faith?
ful companions and kinsmen had care?
fully kept the identity of the spot.
When his remains were exhumed,
it was found that the coffin had been
entirely absorbed and was gono, but
the skeleton wivs in a remarkable
state of preservation. The clay and
gravel had settled down on it. The
skull was in tact. The bullet holu
through it was plain on both sides?
that is, where it had entered and had
come out. A number of people re?
member some still living; other
from tradition- the character of the
shot which caused his sudden death
at the battle of Saltville, Virginia.
All the bones of his arms and nil thu
bones of his legs were in perfect
slate of preservation. The buttons
of his uniform were nlso perfectly
preserved, mi were other motnlio in?
signia. So, there is not. the slight?
est doubt but what his skeleton re?
mains were in a condition to hu per?
fectly identified.
The battle of Saltville, iit which
Colonel Trimble was killed, was prob?
ably one of the most remarkably
fought in the war between the states;
the salt works buing u place of ne?
cessity to the confederates as well
us one of peculiar strategic forma?
tion for protection, from (he olllcin!
report of General Ilurbridge, he had
about 5,000 men on the raid of the
salt works. The confederate defense
had not more than 11,000 men, com?
posed of various marshalled forces
from Virginia and Kentucky, belong?
ing to isolated commands. In this
battle wer? a number of reserves on
the confederate side, composed of old
men over .|fi years of age and young
men between HI and IH. In Dibrell's
brigade of reserves was a battalion
commanded bv Col. Robert Smith, of
Tnzowoll, which battalion, together
with the IOI.ll Kentucky regiment, tin?
der Col. Trimble, was in the expos?
ed defen? at Bllffulo Kord of the Hoi?
st on river at the mouth of Cedar
Branch und on the south side of the
Holsten, Trimble's regiment, and theso
reserves bore the brunt of the hat
He. The historical statement, is made
Hint in this battle the Federal loss in
killed and wounded was about H50
mid the number of prisoners captured
is variously estimated at from 300
to I'.'(Ml; and reinrakable as it may be
thought, the reported confederate loss
was eight, killed and 51 wounded;
among those kcilled being Col. Edwin
Trimble.
Colonel Trimble was a native of
eastern Kentucky, where his ances?
tors went from Tar.owell county.
Speaking of the preservation of the
remains of Ibis gnllnnt soldier, it
seems uncanny that thov shouM have
been so nerfeel after n lapse of more
than half a centurv. Some ono re?
marked at his exhuming, that, the
Strange and perfect, preservation of
his hones demonstrated the stuff of
which this bravo man way made. It
may bo true that the frame of u he?
ro such as Edwin Trimble, is mndo of
material destined to resist decay.
Well, while the remains of this
gallant, and chivalrous man were al?
most forgotten for more than a gen?
eration, they are now placed where,
they will be remembered for mnnv
days to come. I have thought it
pathetic that, he could not rosf in the
mountains of Kentucky, where he was
horn and from which he came to give
up his youthful life in the heroic
struggle between sections of the snmo
blood, who are now friends.
I wish to say that Mr. John W. St.
Clnir is duo the credit, of keening for
identification the grave of this gal?
lant soldier and for the removnl of
his remains to the public cemetery.
Mr. St. Clair belongs to that clasa
of young men in the south, to whom
'he fame and prestige of the Confed?
erate soldier mav forever hereafter
he entrusted.
A suitable monument will he erect?
ed over Colonel Trimble's new grave.
