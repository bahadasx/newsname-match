Battle For Possession of the
City, Taken From German
Forces by Allies, is Mark-
- ed By Ferocious Fighting
i
By Henry Wood.
With the French Armies near
Comblea, France, Sept. 29. Horses,
lashed Into a furious gallop by mad
riders, dashing forward over a sunk
en road with huge quantities of am
munition; aeroplanes, soaring above
vulture-like, awaiting the fall ot
Combles; men, sweating, fighting
their way forward over shell-pocketed
roads In terrible shell fire
These were some of the dramatic
scenes that preceded the capture of
the strongly fortified village that had
'blocked the allied advance north of
the Bom me.
The eventual capture of Combles
j became a certainty on Tueaday morn
jlng when French cavalry patrols ad
vancing northeastward and English
cavalry patrols, thrusting south
eastward, met eastward ot Combles.
shl a t . . ....
fjnry jnut ewropieieiy noircied tne
I village, cutting off the last communi
cations with the German army In the
rear. .
On the same morning I approached
Combles from the west, starting from
Marlcourt, the Junction point from
which the French and English offen
sive was launched July 1, and tra
versing each successive step In the
advance made Id the Intervening
three months toward the attainment
of this first great objective. When
we arrived within less than a mile
and a quarter of Combles the town
Itself was then undergoing the final
bombardment and assault.
Although Combles was a mere vil
lage of 1,500 people, the Germans
had so fortified every house, espe
cially the cellars, where machine runs
were Installed, thai the allies were
forced to employ siege methods. They
completely encircled the town with
their heavy artillery, which generally
closed In with every advance of the
Infantry lines.
From the viewpoint of the enorm
ous quantity of artillery massed
against It. and also from the Incal
culable number of shells rained Into
It, Combles can easily boast ot having
undergone the most terrific siege In
the history of the world.
It was only on reaching the most
advanced artillery lines before
Combles that one could grasp mathe
matically the methodical progress
which had rendered the allies' new
tactics of advancing by heavy artil
lery absolutely Irresistible, though
the final artillery lines before
Combles consisted of comparatively
llKht batteries. These hove been
rushed forward during the night over
ground rendered almost Impassable
by shell shots to everything but foot
soldiers. But while troops were tug
ging guns across the ground, a veri
table army 'of soldiers had sunk a
tortuous winding roadway several
feet below the surface ot the ground,
paving It with bricks from nearby
houses, wrecked by artillery fire. Over
this, when we arrived early the next
morning, munition caissons, screened
from the enemy's observation by the
depth of the roadway, drawn by four,
six and even eight horses, were dash
ing along every moment with an In
credible number of shells necessary
to feed this advanced artillery which
could be reached In no other way.
Back from these advanced linos of
galloping, careening caissons were
thousonds more soldiers, methodical

Failure of New York Trades
Unions to Quit Work in
Sympathy With the Strik
ing Carmen Upsets Plans
New York, Sept. 29. A new date
for a general strike call to all trades
unions In New York city may be set
today, following the failure of the
nnlcn workers to walk out on Wed
nesday. Monday next Is the date on
which laoor leaders now predict tttat
the long-threatened tie-up will he
toted.
There is a possibility, however, that
the meeting on that date, which will
be held In Beethoven hall, wlll be
marked, not by the long exoected
"general suspension of work." but by
the Central Federated union formally
calling off the plan.
"Tne ngbt is still on." labor lead
ers declared today, while admitting
that the unions have stood by their
contracts and tailed to walk out as
expected.
Police Commissioner Woods de-
clwred: - .
"As far as we can ascertain. It's
all over. Of course we shall continue
the same vigilance."

JAPAN TO COMPETE
WITH U.S. AFTER WAR
Chicago, Sept. 29. Japan, at the
present time, is friendly to the United
States, but In the days that follow the
end of the world war will be her
leading commercial competitor, ac
cording to E. H. Gary, chairman ot
the TJ, S. Steel eorporaUon-.who.ar.
rived here today en route east from
his trip to Japan and the Philippines.
Upon arrival, Gary went to a hotel
and expects to stay here two days and
then resume his eastern trip.
In response to a question aa to the
probable duration of the war, Gary
replied:
"As far as I am personally Inform
ed there is less reason to expect an
early termination of the war than
there was twelve months ago. I, ot
course, like everyone else, hope It
will soon end.'
Gary was asked in regard to the
attitude ot the Japanese toward the
United States.
"During my travels In Japan I did
not observe any manifestation ot anti-
American feeling on the Dart of the
Japanese.. There may be a different
feeling among the members of the so
called war party, but I saw.no out-,
ward Indications. I met manv of the
Reading men . and they made every
effort to convince me of the friendly
feeling ot the Japanese toward us.
"Outwardly, Japan bears no indi
cation of the nation being at war. The
Japanese are going along aa If there
waa no war. They have taken ud ex
tensively the manufactures that were
stopped In the belligerent countries
before the beginning of the war.
"Did you know Japan Is the second
largest copper producing country in
the world? In Nagasaki I saw them
building warships, but of course I
do not know for whom they were
building them.
"Japan is busy making clothing
and shoes. She is becoming a great
commercial factor."

Washington, Sept. 29. While the
statement of David Lloyd-George, :
British war minister, through the
United Press, aroused great interest
on the part of Secretary 'Lansing and ,
other officials of the state department.
It was today regarded by these offi
cials more in the light of confirming
this government's attitude than
sounding a warning against steps
England believed were under way.
The decision of the administration
not to intervene until it was certain
peace overtures would be acceptable
to both sides was reached aome time
ago. ,
It Is regarded as significant that the
Lloyd-George statement should have
followed closely on the heels of re
ports from England that Germany
might be expected to "set another
peace kite flying" In October.
American officials are therefore in
clined to feel that the statement ot
the war minister was prompted more'
to forestall any possible move that
might result from the expected Ger
man peace feeler than by actual be
lief that, the United States was about
to intervene.
