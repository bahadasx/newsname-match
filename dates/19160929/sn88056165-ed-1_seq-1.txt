PREPARING FOR
THE RIG FAIR
Committees Busily At Work
Fixing For Big Show—Out
look Good for Many Fine
Exhibits.
Everybody is busy this week
getting ready for the big fair
and stock show the coming week
and if the weather man will only
grant us a continuation of the
present good weather Cotton
wood will put up a fair next
week that will be a credit to a
town several times the size of
this little burg.
From reports received from the
surrounding country the exhibits
of livestock, grain, fruits and
vegetables will be quite large in
spite of the fact that many farm
ers are still engaged in harvest
work and are unable to give
much attention to the preparing
of exhibits. Very satisfactory
reports have been received from
the superintendents of the live
stock department and they assure
us of some very nice exhibits in
this line, some of the best known
breeders of the county having
promised to be here with their
herds.
Quarters for the livestock are
being prepared this week and
will be so arranged that the
stock and sightseers can be kept
in the dry, no matter what the
weather may be.
The well known Kamiah In
dian band of 25 pieces has been
secured for all three days of the
fair and will supply plenty of
music, while there will be no end
of other amusements. The
sports committee has something
up its sleeve for each afternoon
at the ball park and some comi
cal "stunts" may be looked for.
The parade on the morning of
the opening day will also be a
feature wort!) going miles to see,
while the stock judging and lec
tures by men from the state uni
versity on the second day will be
of particular interest to the
farmers and stockmen.
Another feature of no small
importance will be the sale of
purebred and grade stock on the
afternoon of the last day by auc
tioneer Harry C. Cranke, of Spo
kane. Besides the stock offered
for sale by the exhibitors, it is
the desire of the fair manage
ment that other livestock be
brought in from the surrounding
country and offered for sale that
day. All stock sold will be auc
tioned off to the highest bidder
the same as at the larger stock
shows.
Oh, yes! We almost forgot the
most attractive feature of the en
tire program: That is the big
free barbecue dinner on the open
ing day, when a fine, fat steer
will be roasted whole and dished
out, with the usual trimmings,
to the hungry. This feature, it
is believed, will prove especially
attractive to visitors from a dis
tance and we hope there will be
plenty here from Lewiston and
intermediate points to "take
care" of this part of the pro
gram successfully.
Yes, it is going to be a real
fair, even if it is the first one,
and you will be sorry later if you
let anything keep you at home.
Ivan Brockman was in town
Monday from Grangeville.
L. L. Peregrine, a prominent
business man of Asotin, was in
the city Tuesday.
Deputy Sheriff Will Eller was
in town Monday from the county
seat.
Theodore Wasem returned to
Lapwai Wednesday after a visit
with relatives in this vicinity.
Bitten By Mad Dog
While heidirg his flock of
sheep near Soda Springs Aug
ust 7, Pablo Etturife was bitten
by a dog which latter developed
rabies. No serious results de
veloped until September 7, just
thirty days from the day he was
bitten. He was brought to the
Soda Springs hospital last Thurs
day suffering intense agony and
died in convulsions.
This is the first case of the
kind in this part of Idaho. An
unsuccessful attempt was made
to interest the state sanitary dé
partirent. The head of the in
fected dog was sent to Boise.
Two other sheep men who be
came infected are now taking
treatment at the Kackley hos
pital under the personal super
vision of Dr. Kackley.
Death Claims Hockersmith
Jesse Hockersmith, the un
fortunate young man who was
so seriously injured here last
week by being thrown from a
horse, died Friday night from his
injuries and the remains were
taken to Grangeville Sunday and
laid to rest in the cemetery at
that place that afternoon. The
funeral was held from the
Christian church, Rev. Callison
preaching the sermon. The fun
eral was quite largely attended
and many beautiful offerings
graced the casket. Many from
this place attended the last rites.
Got Fine Price For Big Crop
M. F. Rogers and son, W. R.
Rogers, were in town Wednesday
from east of Greencreek and re
ported having just finished
threshing their crops and selling
the same. They threshed about
8,000 bushels this year and mar
keted it at $1.75 per hundred for
white barley and $1.25 per bushel
for Marquis wheat. The younger
man had almost dedided to sell
his holdings and quit farming
last spring but later changed his
mind and is now quite glad he
did so. Lee Johnson, a step-son
of Mr. Rogers, is also harvesting
a big crop in that same locality.
He had over 500 acres in crop
this year, part of which was In
dian land, and we are told his
crop will total more than 21,000
bushels. At present prices he
will realize a small fortune from
his year's labor and will be able
to retire if he so desires.
Herman VonBargen and wife
were in the city Wednesday ev
ening from near Fenn.
George Sheldon and Arthur
Mundt were in the city Wednes
day from the Winona section.
Vern Randall arrived here
Thursday evening for a visit with
his sister, Mrs. Fet Rhoades,
aster which he will go to Nez
perce where he has accepted a
position as Unitype operator on
the Herald force.
Joseph Schaeffer, of the Ferdi
nand section, reports a yield of
74 bushels of white winter bar
ley to the acre from an 80-acre
field and Joe Brockman, of the
same locality, secured a yield of
70 bushels per acre from a 98
acre field. The latter sold his
crop for $1.77 per hundred, re
ceiving over $5,800 for it. No
need of talking about the "poor,
down-trodden farmer" when
considering such yields and
prices.
To The Auto Owners
All auto owners who desire to
take part in the parade at the
coming fair are requested to line
up their cars for the parade on
the morning of October 4th on
I Main street near the flour mill,

Hog Prices Go Soaring
Nine and a quarter cents a
pound was the price offered here
Monday for fat hogs for ship
ment to Spokane and coast points
but at even these attractive
prices the sales were by no
means heavy. In fact, the big
price being paid for grain is
causing many farmers to dispose
of their hogs as feeders even at
a couple of cents below fat hog
prices and the hog shipments
will not be nearly as heavy this
fall as usual. The low prices
quoted for hogs last fall and win
ter caused many of them to go
out of the business entirely and
others cut down their herds ma
terially, so the hog crop was
quite a lot below normal. In the
course of the next six weeks the
hogs now fattening in the stub
ble fields will be ready for mar
ket but after these are disposed
of the sales will be light for the
rest of the year and it is believed
the present high price of grain
will result in very few hogs being
held over by the farmers even
for breeding purposes. This will
result in a great scarcity of hogs
for the next year at least and
prices can be expected to main
tain even a higher level than the
present quotations.
Manager Meyer, of the local
flour mill, states that he is being
offered all kihds of feeder hogs at
almost any price he is willing to
pay and could buy several times
the number he now has if he
could see his way clear to handle
them.
FREE!
With every Monarch Range,
bought during the stock fair, will
be given free one $10.00 set of
aluminum ware consisting of 12
pieces, drop in and see them.
