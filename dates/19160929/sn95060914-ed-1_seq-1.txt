a study of the beautiful ballads
and classics in Irish music A
number of original songs have
been written As a result we
have a program which is dis
tinctively artistic of beautiful
music and with such a strong
sympathetic appeal that we feel
a greater esteem and love for the
Irish people with their happy
sunny ways their sentiment
their romance their cheerfulness
and courage
There is an abundance of good
music in the program Every
one of the six Killarney Girls
is a splendid singer It is not
too much to say that this is by
far the strongest ensemble lady
singing organized on the Lyceum
platform The instrumental part
is well sustained and brilliantly
