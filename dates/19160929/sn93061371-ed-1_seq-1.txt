It's time to pack the tools with which
I'm to hew out my own little des

route up attiira by way of tha back,
stairway.
When she came down all ready for"
the train, a maid handed her Perry"
Morton's card, with this measagw
Written on it: "Good-by, Nell. Luck
t6' you. If I bob up now and then
lease try to regard me as a good

When she arrived that nfglit nt her
Uny one-room-nnd-kitchenette? apart

and white fWea". A fev moment
later, a telegram iVa delivered to her.
It contained this message: "Omen
number one. May the r0roloi-edl
days outnumber the colorless on two
to ono. Perry." '
Nell worked hard. During her first
months she had occasional notes from1
Perry Morton, but since he had goner
out tO a western ranch he had sent
her but one ilot and It contafnect lit
tle more than his address. One day,
jfo after she had taken a contract
for fiirfu'Shihg some apartments sbe
was exploring aotft In a furniture
shop when she was effusively greeted
by a young bride from her home city.
"Oh, Nell! What a lovely surprise!"
exclaimed the bride. "No 'one" would
suspect you were Involved in, a mys
tery." "Mystery? Why, Adelaide, what
an you moan?" asked Ne' "

teaoi'iijf fimiU, "everybody at home

"I see nothfii'g mysterious It
sounds just plain silly iO ne," laughed
fY'l!. Rha noticed on her table it
magazine addressed to her. . It was
mailed at the publishers' in Ner
York, and, looking through it, she
found a blue pencil mark in the index
at this item: "Subsequent Changes ot
Program, A Story, by P. M. Ortcn."
It was the story of a young man's"
awakening to hit own unimportance
by hearing the gfrl he loved speak
lightly of him. While It told of no
remarkable achievements attained by
the mart, It showed how his mental
attitude toward life had undergone
such a change that life must hence
forth mean something deep to' him.
All the next day Nell had that,
story in her mind, and a hundred!
times she wondered whether the name!
"P. M. Orton" was a contraction of
Perry Morton's name, or merely a co-
Incidence, but as often she put thei
thought from her and tried to be ir-l
different about It. When she reached
homo that evening she found a tele
gram from Perry with only this sen
tence: "The last omen but one, and
it will follow shortly.".
Half an hour later, Perry appeared
at her door.
"Nell, dear," he began recklessly, as
soon as their first greeting was over,
"have I bungled things? But I want
ed to know, and I couldn't tell you
that day I overheard you tell your
sister I was an easy-going, line-cf-least-reslstance
product of my environment,
whose life program had all beeu
printed in advance, and so on."
"Oh, Perry, please don't," began
Nell.
"Oh, yes, Nell, that was the making
of me. Right that minute 1 saw my
self In a new light that fairly hurt
my eyes with its clearness, and I set
about face to mend my ways and
change my program. Of course, I
didn't write that Btory, but I told Mrs.
Mapes about it you know she makes
her living writing stories and 1 had
her rewrite it five times before it car
ried the message I wanted it to. And,
Nell," he continued, with less sure
ness of tone, "the plans for my re
modeled country house are In my
pocket. Is there any message In your
heart that corresponds to the one I
tried to get to you through tht con
founded magazine story?"
She did not speak, but he read "sur
render" in her telltale face.
