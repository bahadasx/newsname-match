Asserts Germany Will Fight
Until War Brings Her
the Victory
By Carl W. Ackerman.
(United Tress stuff correspondent.)
Berlin, Kent. 29. Chancellor Von
Hcihinnnn-Hollweg'g reichstng address,
glueing the blame for continuation of
the European slaughter at the door of
(ermany's enemies, won enthusiastic
approval from the majority of the reieh
ttnfj members today.
The chancellor made no offers of
peace nnd he indicated that in view of
1lio utterances of allied statesmen it
Mould be folly to expect an early ending
of the war.
His speech lacked the hopeful tone of
Jus former nddrosses,
"The desire for territorial conquest
by our enemies is responsible for the
daily piling up ot mountains of corps
en," aaid the chancellor.
"The British leave no doubt as to
what they wish to do to Germany. Thev
wish to crush-out our existence as a na
tion. A Germany crushed economical
Iv. defenseless from the militarv stand
point, boycotted by the world and con
demned to eternal feebleness that is
the Germany England wishes to see at
her feet.
Wants World Supremacy.
"Then, when England no longer 'fears
German competition, when France has
been bled to death, when all her allies
are slaves of Knglnnd, when European
neutrals must submit to every British
order, the dream of British world-supremacy
is to become a reality.
"From the very beginning, this war
lias been for Germany nothing but the
defense of our rights of life nnd liber
ty," said the chancellor. "Therefore,
Germany, first and only of all the bel
ligerents declared her readiness for ne
gotiations on December 9, 1!1, and lat
er on several occasions.
'.'We. did our duty, nor does anybody
dare to ask that we nmke proposals to
dnv when our enemies, as Mr. Brrand
did a short while ago, said that peace
now would be considered a humilia
tion and the thought of pence a provoca
tion and disgrace to the memory of the
dead. Our enemies continue the war
because they hope to reach their Utop
ian aim.
Germany Wants Lasting Peace.
"The French premier said in one of
his latest speeches that France fights
t'r a firm lasting penco in which the
freedom of nationalities is protected
ugaiiiNt all attacks by international
jigreeinont. This we wunt, too, to pro
tect Germany forever against every at -
tack. But does Mr. Briiind, who united
our enemies before the war into an nl -

dan lust of coiKiuest and English policy

for the sake of humanity and progress?

El Faso, Texas, Sept. 29. In one of

When Standard Oil of New

yesterday, it brought the coun
ter value of the stock of Stand
ard Oil as it existed before the
government dissolved it as a
naughty trust up to $2,014 a

the added values of each frac

John D. owns. 247,092 shares,

Tiie value of these holdings at

PRESIDENT WILL
ASK HUGHES SOI
APT QUESTIONS
One Is: "Would You Now, If
In Power, Repeal Adam
son Law?"
WILL STAND SOLIDLY
FOR EIGHT HOUR LAW
This Peace, Prosperity and
Business Preparedness
Taken Up
By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Asburv Park, N. J., Sept. 29. Four
issues pence, prosperity, business lire
paredness nnd the eight hour 'law will
be enunciated by President Wilson
when he goes into the country to wind
up his campaign for re-election, it wns
learned today. These issues he regurds
as the ones upon which tho voters will
vindicate or denounce his ndminiHtra
tion.
The president is feeling fit, appears a
tritle heavier and says he's in good trim
for the coming trips west. He is enthus
iastic about going ns is Mrs. Wilson,
who will accompany him everywhere. It
will be Mrs. AVilson's first taste of a
real campaign and she is entering into
it with zest.
Tho man on the street, the president
believes, is thankful, first of nil that his
country is at pence. For that reason
his foremost issue will be mi nppenl to
the voters not to accept what the presi
dent term "radical changes of policy
which may alter the whole aspect of the
nation's life," and "endanger the pros
cut terms of pence nnd good will with
the world."
To Meet the New Era. :
Secondly he will point to the great
prosperity of the country nnu define
how the administration tins placed a leg
islative bulwark tinder this to preclude
the possibllty of finnncinl depression
at tho conclusion of the European war.
He plans to offer a constructive pol
icy to meet the unprecedented ccon
omic conditions which will urine wheu
Europe again is able to enter the com
petitive markets of trnde. In this he
will appeal particularly to the young
men as those upon whom "the future
development of the country depends in
an unusual and peculiar degree." He
will urge the "cultivation of imagina
tion, vigor, vision and enterprise" to
meet tho new era.
Finally the president will chnllenge
his political critics to meet squarely the
eight hour day issue and state what
they would have done in n situation sim
ilar to that confronting him recently
when a grout railroad strike was threat
ened. "Would you now, if in power, repeal
the Adnmsoit law?" is n question which
may be expected by Hughes in the near
future.
The president planned late this aft
ernoon to hold n conference with news
papermen for the 'first time in two
Veurs. This will be a regular program
hereafter.
Abandonment of these conferences re
sulted from embarrassing questions ask
ed when relations with Germany were

For the first time in the history of a

the board of fair directors decided to
yield to the requests of tho various or
ganizations of the ta;e that had peti
tioned for an additional fair day and
all ot the pavilions will be open to
the public next Suuday.. . There will bo
no race program in the afternoon but
a sacred concert will be held in tho
horse show tent which will seat 10.000
people when seats are placed in the show
ring.
Efforts are being made by the secre
tary of tho fair, A. H. Lea, to secure tho
services of Madam Schuman-Heinke as
a speciul . attraction at the concert.
Mud urn Schumnn-llciuke is now at Mt.
Angel nnd the wires are being burned
to induce the renowned singer to ap
pear at the Suuday concert. All of tho
side show concessions terminate their
contracts Saturday night and none will
be allowed to open up on Sunday with
tlie exception of a few rofreshmotit
stands and possibly some of the Ferris
whcols anil tho merry-go-round. At any
rate there is no possibility that tho
blatant tones of the ballyhoo man will
blend with tho voices of the artists who
will be secured for the concert. '

able to attend the fair during the week
on account of the increased patronago
during the fair week and that those who
were obliged to work all during fair
week should bo given a chance to visit
the fair on Sunday when all of tho
exhibits and other attractions were in
placo. Tho price of admission will bo
25 cents.
Today was Governor's day at tho
