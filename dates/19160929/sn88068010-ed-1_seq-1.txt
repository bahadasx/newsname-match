THE EUROPEAN WAR
Germans Losing Ground in France

It appears from recent gains
that the Allies will force the i
German Army out of part of
France. In Flanders and Bel

Bulgarians have been success

being forced into the war and
may fall in with the Germans,
being incensed at the arbitrary
demands of England.

Big Tent Meeting
The State Democratic Commit
tee has selected Brunswick as
the place and October 18th the
day for the big county tent meet
ing.
The Executive Committee of
of the County Democratic Comt
met yesterday to ratify and ar
range for this and other cam
paign matters.
The Bridge club was enter
tained Wednesday afternoon by
Mrs. C F. Lamkin.
Col. Gardner Opens Campaign
The opening speech of his cam
paign was made by Col. Fred D.
Gardner at Chillicothe Saturday
afternoon, and to say that he
had not only met the popular de
mand for state government but
was entitled to be classed among
the best speakers in the state,
is conservative.
Col. Gardner more than fully
iret thrt arguments against a
State Land Bank. He effectu
ally put out of further consider
ation by any of the campaign
slogan of Judge Lamm. He told
the great gathering what he
would do, if elected, in connec
tion with the business manage
ment of the affairs of the seper
ate departments of the state so
far as the governor had anything
to say in such matters, and de
claring that he would not again
be a candidate for any other of
fice, he convinced all who heard
him that politics would cut no
figure whatever in his selection
of those it will be his preroga
tive to appoint.
Hon. Jas. A. Reed also made a
speech which it would be worth
the while of every man and wo
man in the state to hear as well
a3 the voters. Senator Keed
shows the effect of the strain
which has been on Congress for
months, but there is the same
old fire and logic in his speeches.
Senator Reed's specification of
the accomplishments of the Wil
son administration and his analy
sis of the campaign of Judge
Hughes are superb and conclu
sive. He will effectually destroy
the criticisms of Judge Hughes
wherever he is heard.
Judge Albert D. Nortoni who
so resented the action of Col.
Roosevelt in dumping or rather,
undertaking to pitch the entire
Progressive-Party 'into the lap-
of reactionary republicans that
he resigned his position on the
Court of Appeals bench and
went out to campaign for Wil
son and the Democratic platform,
also spoke and if there is a Pro
gressive who will not admit the
correctness of the position taken
by Judge Nortoni, that man was
not a Progressive. Together
with Col. Gardner and Senator
Reed, Judge Nortoni spoke at
Brookfield Saturday night and
to such an immense audience as
indicated that the people of his
old county of Linn were more
than proud of their distinguished
former fellow citizen. The ap
plause accorded Col. Gardner,
Senator Reed and Judge Nortoni
indicated that Linn county was
in thorough accord with the
administration, the purposes of"
Col. Gardner and the sentiments
held by Judge Nortoni respect
ing the republican party.
Such a crowd as gathered at
Chillieothe Saturday afternoon
could only be exceeded by the
one which collected at Brook
field Saturday night to hear the
distinguished speakers. At Brook
field automobiles were parked
from the lower end of the south
side to the park on the north and
every side street was made al
most impassable by the autos
and vehicles of all other descrip
tions which were strung thru
them. Not one fifth of the
crowd which came to hear the
speakers could get in the big
opera house. It was certainly a
most encouraging day at both.
cities for the democrats, and if
Col. Gardner and Senator Reed
do not win by the largest majori
ties ever given to candidates for
any offices in the state, then ail
early signs fail.
Chautauqua enthusiasts have
contracted with the White-Meier
system of Kansas City for
next year and believe they have
secured something worth while
this time.
