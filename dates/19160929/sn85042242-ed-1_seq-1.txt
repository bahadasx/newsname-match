(The first of two article* on the
amazing growth of Detroit, Mich.,
which practically has doubled its pop­
ulation in the past six years.—Ed­
itor.)
By LEON STARMONT.
Detroit, Mich., Sept. 28.—This won­
der city of the western hemisphere,
now claiming rank as fifth in the
United States, already talks of rival­
ing Chicago as metropolis of the
American midlands!
Detroit doesn't even know now how
big it is growth is so rapid the hous­
ing facilities never catch up with
the population but there are close to
a million people on the American side
of the river, within ten miles of the
city hall! There were 465,000 in 1910.
Pittsburg, Baltimore, Cleveland,
Boston—Detroit insists she has pass­
ed them all, and is close on the heels
of St. Louis, with Philadelphia plod­
ding along but a doubtful distance
ahead!
In 1900.
And this is the town that in 1900
was thirteenth in population, ranking
with such places as Milwaukee and
New Orleans—the town that went by
local time and fought construction of
the Detroit river tunnel for fear it
would make the place a way-station
between Chicago and Buffalo!
Detroit's building permits have
passed Chicago's, and this month the
record so. far in 1916 eclipsed tho
mark for the whole tanner year of
1915, which was $32,235,550.
Bank clearings on September 16
reached'and left behind the total for
the high-water year of 1915, which
was $1,484,972,640.28. That puts De­
troit in tenth place in bank clearings,
just ahead of Cleveland. At the same
rate for the rest of the year Detroit
banks will clear more than $2,000,000,
000.
Bank deposits now total $297,000,
000, an increase over the same time
last year of $51,000,000. There are
only 17 banks, but there are 95
oranches—more in proportion than
ha any other city.
As to population, Detroit's figure
based on the number of names in her
city directory as compared to the
number in 1910, when the United
States census was taken, gives her
820,00-0 people within the city limita.
Slopped All Over.
But Detroit has slopped all over the
city limits—pour a gallon of gasoline
into a pint cup and you'll get an idea
of what'£:h'as happened. Good-sized
cities like Hanitramck (30,000) and
Highland Park, (40^000), which adjoin
Detroit, have: hot been taken in but
an annexation' project to come up in
the sprittg provides for the gobbling
of territory lying all around them,
which will make these two places,
embracing 70,000 inhabitants, isolat­
ed islands within the city.
Detroit estimates the population
just at her gates, including the two
ciies menioned, as la per cent of her
own total soithe immediate metro­
politan district is estimaed at 820,
000 plus 1 per cent of that number,
or 943,000.
This does not include the down­
river industrial center of Wyandotte,
which is connected with Detroit by
the continuous community of Ecorse
and River Rouge it does, not include
the lakeside suburb of Grosse Pointe
Farms, where many Detroit million
aires have elaborate mansions it
does not include the three Canadian
cities just across the river—Wind­
sor, Sandwich and Walkerville. With
these included, Detroit would run
well over a million.
At one time last summer there
were 25,000 people living in tents in
Detroit and Highland Park, because
they couldn't get houses to live in.
Tent Dwellers.
There are fewer tent-dwellers now,
but families are living two and three
to a house or flat. Detroit has a
standing offer of work for 20,000 me­
chanics but there is no place for
them to live if they come.
Thousands of families have moved
to Flint, Pontiac, and other automo­
bile centers but more thousands
keep coming.
The street cars can't carry the
crowds. People hang on the ends like
flies on a drop of syrup."
Woodward avenue at 6:00 p. m. is
the most congested street in America.
Detroit plans a five-mile subway to
deliver north end residents some­
where north of "the boulevard."
"The auto business, of course, is
responsible," many will say.
There are 27 automobile factories
and more than 100 plants making
parts and accessories Detroit turns

day, told her husband today that her
part in the tragedy was an innocent
one, and he accepted her word for it,

doubt as to his wife's loyalty to him.
"I knew it," he exclaimed, after a
talk with his wounded wife. "She
has given me the straight account
of this distressing affair. She's true
to me. She hasn't been in the wrong,
and I'll take her back to Chicago as
soon as she can travel."
Comes From Chicago.
Mr. LeDuc came here today from
his home in Chicago and went im­

Margaret Gorey Arrested in Cin
cinnati for Attempt to Bleed
Physician
Cincinnati, O., Sept. 28.—Margaret
Gorey, a trained nurse, was arrested
here today in the oflices of Dr. A. C.
L. Reed, a prominent physician and
surgeon, charged in an indictment re­
turned earlier in the day by the Ham­
ilton county grand jury, with black­
mail. The arrest brought to light a
series of attempts by the police, one
of which they claim, finally resulted
in success, to obtain a confession
from Miss Gorey through the means
of a telephonic device.
In a statement directly following
the arrest. Dr. Reed said .Miss Gorey
had sought employment from him,
that she had been refused and, follow­
ing repeated attempts on her part to
induce him to employ her, she had
threatened to bring suit against him
based on a charge of immoral con­
duct. Dr. Reed stated that Miss Go­
rey had confessed, while the police
were on the other end of the tele­
phonic device, listening ito the entire
conversation, that she knew the
charge to be false, but she likewise
knew he could not prove that it was
false, and she would settle the mat­
ter for $20,000.

No Indication of General Walk­

Police Officials
CAR SERVICE IS
GREATLY IMPROVED
Union Leaders Say Affiliated
Unions Have Quit Their
Posts
New York, Sept. 2S.—The widely
exploited sympathetic "walkout" of
trades unionists in Greater New York
in aid of the striking carmen, which
was supposed to have started yester­
day, had not materialized tonight, ac­
cording to the police.
The labor leaders claimed, how­
ever, that upward of 140,000 workers
actually had quit their places, but
refused to give the public the names
of any unions answering the call.
The police declared they were unable
1o linil any evidence of a general
strike.
A meeting late today of represent­
atives of 26 unions of the United
Building Trades, comprising a mem­
bership of more than 100,000, refus­
ed to take any action in the sympa­
thetic strike movement, it was an­
nounced. They simply votedt accord­
ing to their spokesmen, to refer the
question back to the unions them­
selves cind adjourned ufitit next Wed­
nesday.
For the first, time since the car
strike began, September 0, many sur­
face cars were operated today with­
out police guards. Numerous cars
without wire to protect motorinen
and conductors were put into commis­
sion. The service, it was announced,
was improved.
The possibility of a strike of mo
tormen on subway and elevated lines
being ordered by the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers was said, by
union men themselves, to be remote,
inasmuch as the motormen now are
earning from $8 to $10 a day. Inter
borough Aapid Transit officials assert­
ed they did not anticipate any trou­
ble from the brotherhood.

GREEK EX-PREMIER
MAY LEAD REBELS
ELEUTHERIOS VENIZEL05
The reported trip of Venizelos,
former premier to Salonika, capital
of Greece, is taken by military au­
thorities to mean his decision to lead
Greek revolutionists.
The Greek ex-premier resigned his
office at the beginning of the war

not agree on the question of inter­

Stupefying Changes Have Taken
Place in English Govern­
ment
BRITONS LIBERTIES
HAVE DISAPPEARED
BY A STAFF CORRESPONDENT
Paris, 'France, Sept-'*8 —-How^,after

can take much stock in "national
traits" or "nal:o:ial characteristics"
is beyond me.
The war haB not only upset all our
old fixed beliefs oil this subject, hut
has reversed them. What do you
know about that?
Coming over from New York we
had on board an English major that
obliged those present with scenic ef
fects in khaki and decorations while
he enlivened the conversation with
peculiar gifts. He had also a mus
I tache that he treated with wax or
pomade or something, to make the
ends sharp-pointed like an awl, and
he greatly cheered drooping spirits
by diligently cultivating this work
of art in public.
One day the talk fell upon the
French defense of Verdun, and the
major said, without intermitting liis
[labors on the awl-points:
"Ah yes—the little Frenchmen!
They've done quite well, really, you
.know, considering what little beggars
'they are but, of course, we shall
'have to go in and finish the job."
That's the idea—little beggars. Tie
believed it implicity, and so do nine-|
teen in twenty of his countrymen,
For a century and a half tlje English
have believed the French to be a na-1
tion of little folk and meager, and
have succeded in making most of the
rest of us believe it, too. "One Eng­
lishman can lick three Frenchmen,"
was the serenely beautiful English
creed after the accident at Waterloo.

And yet, in this war the true "little

English themselves, and not the
French. The most asstonishing thing

CATTLE PRODUCTION
IS ALARMINGLY LOW
Despite Present Prosperity Profits
Are Lowest for Past 20
Years
Kansas City, Mo., Sept. 28.—Con­
gressional investigation of the live­
stock industry, including the produc­
tion, marketing, slaughter, distribu­
tion and sale of all cattle, was asked
here today in a resolution presented
to the American Bankers association.
Action on the resolution, presented by
George E. Webb, of San Angelo, Tex.,
was deferred until tomorrow.
Cattle Production Low.
"We face the alarming fact that
for twenty years the production of
cattle has not kept pace with the
increase of population, but has de­
creased in number," it, reads. "With
thousands of acres of virgin land be­
ing brought annually under the plow,
we have reduced our annual average
production per acre to about fifty per
cent of the production of our virgin
soil, producing today less than half
the average per acre of European
farms. This, while yet oilr nation Js
in its infancy."
Bankers' Profit* At Minimum.
Despite the present prosperity char
ac.tenzed as the greatest the country
has ever known, hankers are making
less profits than at any lime within
the last twenty years. Statements
to that effect were made to the con­
vention by Joseph Chapman, of Min­
neapolis. Minimum rates of interest
are being paid, Mr. Chapman declared,
although the bankers, themselves, are
being charged with maximum for the
money being loaned.
Recommends Change.
A service charge on small deposit­
ors' accounts was among the things
recommended by him to increase the
profit account. Mr. Chapman also
recommended consolidation of the of­
fice of Comptroller of Currency and
the Federal Reserve Board.
"The Reserve act has demonstrated
that .t is workable and in the main,
the principles upon which it is found­
ed are sound and will endure," he
said. "Being founded largely on the
expeiiences of the large banks in Eu­
rope, it will make money cheap and
plentiful."

against the collection and clearance
of checks without charge, recently
promulgated hy the Federal Reserve
system, was won by them by the

Big Battle Progressing on East­

GERMANS ADVANCE IN
REGION OF GALICIA
Bulgarians Repulsed on MSace-
donia Front Attitude of
Greece Still Doubtful
London, Sept. 28.—Except for a
fresh attack on the part of the Brit­
ish, which gave them the greater part
of a German redoubt, north of Thiep
val and COO prisoners, the troops of
the Entente in the region between
the Soniuie and Ancre rivers in
France, apparently are taking a
breathing spell and consolidating posi­
tions captured in the great offensive,
which began last Monday and has al­
ready netted them Combles, Thiep
val, and other strong German posi­
tions at various points along the 20
mile front.
During the work of consolidation,
however, the big guns of the British
and French are hurling tons of steel
against the new positions the Ger­
mans have taken up, doubtless pre­
paratory to another fresh attack with
Bapaume and Peronne the ultimate
objectives.
Big Battle on Eastern Front.
Meanwhile a big battle is in prog­
ress on the eastern front, in the reg­
ion between Ltusk and Vladimir, Vol
ynski, around Svinrucky, and Korynl
tza, where the Russians are attempt­
ing to advance, but the Teutons are
impeding them by heavy counter at­
tacks. The German war office says
these counter attacks In the region
of ICocynitza, have resulted in the
recapture of positions lost recently by
the Teutons and that the Allied forces
have now passed on beyond them.
Heavy casualties were inflicted on the
Russians, says Berlin, and in .addition
41 officers and 2,800 men were taken
prisoners, and one cannon and seven­
teen machine guns were captured.
Germans Push Lines Forward.
In Galicia, the Germans, west of
Krasnolesie, also pushed forward
their lines, while in the Carpathians
attacks by the Russians were repuled
in hand to hand fighting.
The Russian general staff announc­
es that since General Brusslioff be­
gan his offensive, 420,000 officers and
men of the Teutonic Allies have been
made prisoners, and 600 cannon and
2,500 machine guns and mine throw­
ers have been captured.
Around Petroseny and Hermanstadt,
in Transylvania, the Teutonic Allies
and the Roumanians are engaged in
bitter fighting, but with no import­
ant results having been attained by
either side. The situation in the Do
brudja region is unchanged.
Bulgarians Repulsed.
On the Macedonian front, Paris re­
ports the repulse of Bulgarian at­
tacks oil both sides of Fiorina. There
have been bombardments by the Brit­
ish of positions of the Allies of the
Central Powers by land batteries, in

Brother and Sister Re- United
At St. Alexius Hospital After
Separation of Twenty Years
Man on Sick Bed Advertises in
Illinois Papers and Locates
Relative
Seriously ill and desiring to see
his sister before he died, L. A. Pars­
ley, a patient at St. Alexius hospital,
located her last week, after a separa­
tion of more than 20 years. She ar­
rived in Bismarck Tuesday and will
comfort him in his last days.
An advertisement inserted in sev­
eral Illinois papers brought the sis­
ter and brother together. Several
years ago he came west and settled
In McKenzie. He got out of touch
with the home folks after his moth­
er's death. Sickness revived a long­
ing to see his youngest sister, Mrs.
J. Wright. All he knew of her where­
abouts was that when last heard
from she was living in Illinois. He
decided to place an advertisement in
Illinois papers and last week he re­
ceived a letter saying .that his sister
was on her way to Bismarck. She ar­
rived the first of the week from her
home in Shipman, 111.
The reunion was made possible
when Sister Boniface communicated
with Mrs. Wrieht, telling her of herj
brother's desire to see her.
