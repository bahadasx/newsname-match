FEEDING AND PREPARING MARKET GEESE
EMDEN GANDER SHOWN
The following were among the re
plies received by the United States
Department of Agriculture to the
question, "What Is your method of
feeding and preparing geese for mar
ket: Vincent M. Couch, Moravia, N. Y.:
To fatten goslings, confine, and after
five to six weeks make cornmeal the
principal feed ; add some beef scraps,
and allow them to have some grass.
Of the large breeds, they should weigh
from 10 to 20 pounds at ten weeks old ;
and market nt this age. Reserve the
smaller breeds until holidays.
F. D. Fowler, Carllnville, 111.:
Market geese are kept closely confined
and fed three times a day by measure:
Bran 2 parts, shorts 1 part, ollmeal
and lieef scraps 1 part, cornmeal
1 part, dampened with water so it
will crumble. Whole corn is some
times given. Green food, grit, and wa
ter are always before them.
B. P. Hlslop, Milford, 111.: To pre
pare for market, as soon as weather
becomes cool, confine in small lots.
Commence to feed gradually mash
composed largely of cornmeal, mixed
with milk if convenient, otherwise wa
ter, giving enough forage or vegetables

to keep In health. Increasing grain un
til they have all they will eat, twice
a day, never forgetting plenty of wn
ter and a box of grit. By the time the
goose market is on, say from Thanks
giving to New Yenr's, the birds will be
In prime condition and bring top mar
ket price. To dress them, kill same as
other poultry. Commence to pick the
coarser feathers and most of the down
off as soon as the fatal stab to brain
is given and bleeding commences.
Then sprinkle and rub well with pow
dered rosin, scald and rub down off
quickly, plunge body In hot water then
cold, wipe, and hang up or lay on tublo
to cool before packing.
Mrs. M. Swartsley, Columbus, Neb.:
To give size and flesh, I feed half corn
meal, one-fourth ground oats, the bal
ance barley meal and wheat middlings,
all mixed together with scalding water
or milk, and feed as much as they
will eat four or five times daily, ut
all times providing plenty of water.
51. B. Caldwell, Brougbton, Kan.:
As soon as our goslings are grown up
we turn them in the hog pasture ten
acres of alfalfa and they feed on al
falfa and ent after the hogs, and get
very fat and heavy.
and n little core in the construction
of the nest even though It Is made from
an old soap or shoe box, will accom
plish much.
Jn addition to having our nests as
free from cracks and crevices as pos
sible, we also want the boxes of the
right size for our particular breed of
fowls. Small nests will cramp the
hen and may drive her to drop her eggs
on the floor or In the yards; on the
other hand, If the nests are too large,
the eggs will roll around and get
broken, or too many hens will try to
crowd In the same nest
Have one side of the nest box com
paratively low, so that the hens may
enter from that side by merely step
ping in.
CALLED AN IDEAL KITCHEN
Snowy White, and Not a Single Dark
Cupboard In Apartment Marks Up-To-Date
Household "Workshop."
The following description of the
kitchen In the home of a woman famed
for her Interest In household efficiency
Is given to show whut Intelligence,
combined with a reasonable amount
of money and a determination to have
one's workshop as up-to-date a place
as possible, can do.
The kitchen is white from celling
to tiles and contains no dark cup
boards, but In their pface shelves and
cabinets. On the shelves at one Side
are 50 glass jars of graduated sizes,
each one labeled with the name of a
comestible or condiment. Opposite
these are rows of fireproof glass bak
ing dishes for baking bread, cakes,
pies, custards; the old-fashioned tin
affairs have been discarded ns un
sightly and Insanitary. Instead of
granite ware there are files of bright
aluminum sauce-pans, reflecting points
of sunlight which streams In through
four large windows curtained with
dimity. Under these shelves Is a por
celain sink 40 Inch high. No tired,
round shoulders In this kltcHen, you
see.
Near this stands a gas range with
on automatic electric pilot light and
glass doored ovens with thermometers.
Four feet above the door and near the
range rests a modern steamer, which
will cook an entire dinner over one
gas Jet. In the middle of the 'room
Is a glass-topped table, and. sitting
there, the person who Is doing the
ordering can see at a glance what Is
lacking In the glass Jars. The maid
supplies the list of groceries which
need replenishing at the beginning of
ench month and these are purchased
in quantities at the most economi
cal prices.
RECIPE FOR EXCELLENT HASH
Mixture of Ingredients Has Been
Called by. Its Admirers the
"Best Ever Made."
First of all, fry an onion, finely
Chopped, In one ounce of margarine or
dripping, till it is a golden brown, then
qrld one ounce of flour, and after stir
ring well together for five minutes add
half a pint of stock, well flavored with
vegetables, two or three cloves, salt If
necessary, nnd four tablespooufuls of
catchup. Stir for a few minutes over
the lire, then flavor further with a tea
spoonful orjnore of brown sauce or
meat extract. Let the sauce boll fast
over the fire, so as to reduce It a little,
then add some browning. Strain the
sauce into a small shallow stewpan
and put It on one side to get cold. In
the menntlrne cut some ment, and not
too small slices from your meat, let
ting them be all us much as possihlo
of the same size, nnd remove every
particle of skin, fat, gristle or burnt
portion, as it Is the latter which gives
the "warmed-up" taste that Is so un
pleasant. When the sauce is cold lay
In it the pieces of meat, cover up the
saucepan nnd In about an hour's time
put It at the corner of the stove, worm
Ing by very gradual degrees. If nl
lowed to boll, the meat Is sure to be
tough. As soon as It Is thoroughly hot
It Is ready to be dished up, with the
sauce poured over it, and It should be
surrounded with fingers of bread, fried
a golden color. The addition of a little
finely chopped parsley greatly lin
proves the look of the dish.
Excellent Clam Soup.
One quart of milk, four small pota
toes ait Into small dice and boiled In
water until soft then drain, add milk
and when It comes to a boll add 25
clams chopped fine. Stir occasionally
as It burns quickly. In the meantime
cream one tablespoonful of butter and
one of flour together nnd stir In soup
until all Is dissolved. Add chopped
parsley, pepper and salt to taste. This
Is delicious and can be made quickly
Deviled Filet of Chicken.
Cut the raw meat Into long, thin
strips, or use the legs of cooked tur
key. Dip In melted butter and boll un
til cooked or heated through. Place
on a hot serving dish and spread with
hot mixture. Stir in two tablespoon
fuls of Worcestershire sauce or mush
room catchup, and a dash of salt These
hot seasonings are a matter of taste
largely, and may be added separately
if preferred. The meat may be gashed
nnd laid In the deviled mixture befon
broiling.
French Dressing.
Put one saltspoonfui of salt and one
half saltspoonful of white pepper In
a bowl and stir In three tableapoonfula
of olive oil, then add one-fourth tea-
spoonful of onion Juice nnd one table
spoonful of vinegar. Mix welL
Fly-Paper.
To make fly-papers boll linseed oil
with a little resin till it forms a stringy
paste when cold. Spread this on pa
per, using a large brush. This Is In
expensive, nnd makes one of the best
traps for Pics.
TRIED A DOUBLE-CROSS
One Play Manager Stallings
Couldn't Dope Out.
Two On, Two Out, Hap Myers Bunted,
but Couldn't Get Away With It
Easily Thrown Out and
Braves Lost Game.
The score was 3 to 2 against the
Braves.
This was In a came nlnved In Bos
ton In the summer of 1013. It was
the ninth inning. Two men were out
nnd the Braves had n man on first and
second.
"Hap" Myers, the lonltv Boston first
sncker, walked to the plate. A long
nit would either tie the score or win
the game. "Hap" let the first one
pass and hunted the second. He was
thrown out by nt least ten feet, and
the game was over. The Braves had
lost.
Myers In Terror.
"Hap," In terror over a possible re
buke from Manager George Stallings,
sneaked Into the clubhouse. Stallings
was there, enshrouded In deepest
gloom. IJaselmll never knew a harder
loser than Stallings. But Stnlllngs
never said a word to Myers then, nnd
Myers ducked out of the clubhouse
and went home thinking Stallings had
overlooked the bunt-out
But Stallings hadn't
The next morning found Stnlllngs
ut Myers' home. Myers had Just got
ten up.
" 'Hap,' " said Stallings, "I want to
know why you bunted with two out
and two on bases."
"Well, you see, boss," explained
"Hop," "I thought I'd double-cross the
other fellows."
"Double-cross 'em?" asked Stallings,
puzzled.
Looking for a Hit
"Yes. You see they were looking
for mo to hit It out, and I thought I'd
cntch Vm asleep with a bunt
"Oh, that's It eh?" said Stallings.
"Thought you'd double-cross 'em, hey?
Well, , you didn't double-cross them,
but you did double-cross me. I've
spent the whole night trying to figure
out why you bunted. That's the rea
son, eh wanted to double-cross the
other fellows?"
"Yes; that's It."
"Well, Icmme tell you this, 'Hap'
Myers," nnd Stallings poked a men
acing finger at his big first baseman,
"if you ever again try any of that
double-crossing stuff there'll be a fu
neral in this particular neighborhood.
Good day, double-crosser." And Stall
ings walked nwuy.
HEAT WORRIES LEW M'CARTY
Hot Weather Got Best of Dodgers'
Catcher on Trip Through West
Brief Respite in Bath.
"I used to think I could stand the
heat, but It certnlnly had me all In on
n recent trip we
made through the
West," said Lew
M c C a r t y, back
stop of the Brook
lyn Dodgers.
"When you went
to bed you Just
lay there tossing
around and sweat
ing. Plunging In
to the bathtub af
forded only mo
mentary relief, for
Lew McCarty.
Just as soon as
you got out and dried off the heat got
you agnln.
"I thought Jeff PfefTer would fade
to n grease spot But the boys stood
It and we're all In good condition now
and will go right ahead proving that
any team which cuts Into the world
series will have to beat us to the
goal."
BUG BIT -INDIAN BOSS EARLY
President Dunn of Cleveland Always
Cherished Ambition to Become
Big League Owner.
The new owner of the Cleveland
Indians, James C. Dunn, halls from
n town made famous by that immortal
pioneer of the nntlonnl pastime, A C.
("Pop") Anson of Marshalltown, la.
It was In the Iowa town that Dunn,
who now weighs 240 and wears a No.
17 collar, got his start as a contractor.
The son of a fanner, he began con
tracting on a shoestring when nine
teen, and has amassed sufficient wam
pum to buy the Indians or any other
old ball club be wants without, mist
ing the change.
Jim Is forty-eight and married. He
lives In Chlcngo. The baseball bug bit
him when he was quite young.
"I was quite a fan as a kid," Dunn
says, "but not much of a player. When
a lull) club was formed In Marshall
town 1 was made Its president Ever
since I've been able to muster the cash
I've had hopes of becondng a big
league owner."
PHILLIES THREE MOST
PAT MORAN'S 8TAR PITCHING TRIO.
The Phillies have long been In need of a good left-hander. Eppn RlxeJ
appears to be filling the bill this year. Kppn started out Impressively In 1912,
but later fell off greatly In his work. This season Ittxey started out as if he
was going to equal or beat his record of 1912. He has pitched consistently
good bail all year, and has gained the poise and confidence to make a steady
wlnuer. Illxey is a wiry athlete and physically competent to do powerful
work. As he Is doing better than any other pitcher on the staff excepting
Alexander and Deraaree, Pat Moran has about decided to use the portslder la
every series. A winning southpaw who can stand lots of work will mean much
to the Phils.
