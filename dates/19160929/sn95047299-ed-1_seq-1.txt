I "In all the nine hundred thousand

of the country 1 have not seen any
i piuee. una has tlie possibilities you
nue note tor a great agricultural
cuuiuiy anu denghuul homes. Cal

mere tout were not worth $o an acre
, i.ie now worth from one to two
j thousand, dollars an acre. You do
! not ncuu anything here but some sure
; fc.iougii folks."
i tins is the tribute that C. S. Bar
1 reu, the national president of the
; runners Educational anu Co-opera-;
live union of America paid to 1'lori
ua arier riding through the country
ii om ralatka to Orange Springs to
audress the business men and larm
iers and a great many ladies of Put
nam and Aiurion counties who had
feainereil there Wednesday in the in
let est of the Colonists' Fair of the
r ionua f arms & ltomes, Inc.,
which will be held the third week in
.November.
.Mr. liarrett disabused the minds of
any one who thought that there was
anything antagonistic m the Union's
principles to any other industry con
uucteu on right lines. "If some
larnief in the enthusiasm of the mo
ment happens to blow about what we
fanners are going to do to put the
merchants out of business, don't wor
ry, we ain't going to do any such
thing."
"Vve are not going to tear up any
political party, we are not going to
organize any new party, but we are
going to get the farmer the laws he
must rightfully have to better his
condition. Vou would not have a
general parcels post today if the
r aimers Union had not jammed it
through congress. The little good
that there is in the farm loan act is
uue to the tanners Union. The bill
as originally urawn provided thai the
fanners might get together if ihey
wanted to, get some money if they
could and Joan it out of they would.
"The man wnn tells the farmer tj
;tay out of politics is not hi? friend.
They .'uy ve are the mainstay the
world and ether very fine things
i.bout us, Lut at the same ti'na we
must r. i take part in government af
fairs. What is the government';
The folks in this country are the gov
ernment and the fanners are a mighty
large part of the government. You
don't hear any body advising the
manufacturer or the merchant to stay
out of politics. We advise only this:
Tell the fellow who is in what you
want done."
Mr. Barrett told of the twelve
thousand business enterprises in this
country operated by the members of
the Farmers' Union, principally on
cooperative lines though some were
joint stock companies. Their expe
rience, he said, was that the coop
erative association was much better
for them than the joint stock compa
ny. These twelve thousand enter
prises do a total volumne of business
annually of more than seven hundred
million dollars.
"There are two things the farmers
Union must do," Mr. Barrett said,
"they have got to market the prod
ucts'of the farm to the profit of the
American farmer and they have got
to help him to get cheap money. I
am not blaming anybody but the
farmer for not having solved these
problems before.
Mr. Barrett is accompanied by the
state president, Mr. J. L. Shepard.
These gentlemen will be the guests of
the business men and farmers of Pa
latka and Putnam county at a ban
quet tonight at the Putnam house, at
nine o ciocK. aturaay aiternoon at
two o'clock Mr. Barrett will address
a mass meeting from the steps of
the court house on the subject of the
educational and cooperative move
ment among the farmers.
Wednesday night Mr. Barrett spoke
at Peniel and yesterday afternoon at
Federal Point. Last night he ad
dressed a mass meeting at Hastings.
The Grand Lodge of Florida, Fret
and Accepted Masons, contemplate
the erection and maintenance of a Ma
sonic Home and Orphanage somn
where in the state. The grand lodga
has something like $00,000 in a fund
already to devote to this purpose.
At the last meeting of the grand
lodge oy resolution of the order the
jjiaad master was authorized to ap
point a committee of three to receive
propositions from municipalities look
ing to the location of this home.
W hen the home is built if will be a
home for aged and infirm Masons who
would otherwise be homeless, and for
me orphaned children of Masons.
Palatka should have this Masonic
home. This city tills all the recuiin
iiients all ths specifications which tha
oider had in mind are ours.
We have transportation facilities,
heallnlulness, educational facilities,
-iiitl we have moral tone.
Such an institution, beside being a
credit to the great fraternal order
which is to stand sponsor for it, will
be a credit to the city lucky enough
to succeed in securing it.
W. II. U'Aeal of Orlando, Staf
ford Caldwell of Live Oak and Chas.
Hi. Kowton of this city constitute
the grand lodge committee to whom
proffers of a site must be made. At
the annual convention of the grand
lodge in January these gentlemen wi 1
report the oilers and the grand lodge
will make the selection. The Palat
ka Mews has received the following
letter signed by this committee:
"To Cities, Towns, Chambers of Com
merce, Boards of Trade, and all
Others Interested;
"The undersigned are a committee
appointed by the Grand Master of the
Grand Lodge Free and Accepted Ma
sons of Florida to receive all offers
of donations of land and other in
ducements for the selection and loca
tion of the Masonic Home and Or
phanage to be established by the
Grand Lodge Free and Acepted Ma
sons of Florida. It is expected that
the location will be determined by the
next Grand Communication of tha
Grand Lodge in January, 1917, The
selection of the location will depend
upon transportation facilities, health
fulness, educational facilities, and
moral tone of the community.
"The undersigned will be glad Lo
leceive and investigate all offers of
land and other inducements for the
location of this Masonic Home and
Orphanage. Full details as to the
land offered, the location thereof, as
sessibility, general character of soil,
heilthfulness, water supply, gas or
electric facilities, should be given; al
so full information as to transporta
tion facilities, healthfulness, educa
tional opportunities and moral tone
of the community making the offer.
"The proposed institution is to be
a Masonic Home and Orphanage for
the care of aged and infirm Masons
and helpless orphans of deceased Ma
sons. The Grand Lodge has reached
the point where it wishes to consider

i committee was appointed to receive
offers, compile the data and make fud
ri port to the next Grand Communi
st ion of the Grand Lodge. Address
all offers and inquiries to Stafford
Caldwell, Secretary of Committee,

The board of trade might get busy
on this immediately. Palatka shout!

10 OPEN BUSINESS
In Palatka Men of Experi
ence and Abundant
Capital.
Of course you have noticed the
pretty store which Leo Jacobson has
just erected on Lemon street a few
doors west of the New Hotel James.
You have noticed also that it is a
big, ground floor with a most attrac
tive front, and that it not only is well
lighted but that is is being finished off
in excellent taste. This store is 31
x 80 feet, which is some size.
As has been known for some time
Mr. Jacobson built this store for
Messrs. Morris and Dave Fruchtman,
two hustling young men who have
long made a specialty of Ladies' and
Children's ready-to-wear apparel, men
who are experts in these lines.
These gentlemen are in the citv to
day making arrangements for their
opening.
It is really a compliment to Palatka
that such hustling young business
men have picked out this place for a
business location. They see the pos
sibilities of the city and have been
governed in their selection by a study
of the demands of the people now
here. They saw that Palatka ladies
would appreciate a home store that
made a business of catering to their
demands for stylish apparel. They
know the demand is here and they al
so knew that they could meet that
demand, hence their lease of this
store even before the first brick was
laid.
The News has met the Messrs.
Fruchtman, and from assurances giv
en it is certain that when their new
store is open one week from Saturday
(Oct. 7th) that they will be able to
show the people of Palatka and Put
nam county some new wrinkles in
modish garments for women and chil
dren. "We shall not deal altogether in
what is known as exclusive apparel,"
said Mr. Fruchtman, "but will carry
a line of medium priced garments as
well, in fact we shall aim to meet the
demands of all people and at prices
we know they will appreciate."

The New York Herald of the 18th
inst. contains a view of the new pow
er houseboat Vagabondia, built for W.
L. Mellon of Pittsburg, and designed
for Florida waters. In its descrip
tion the Herald says:
Of all the unusual internal com
bustion motored yachts built this year
the Vagabondia, for W. L. Mellon, of
Pittsburg, Pa., is one of the most re
markable. The Vagabondia is a
houseboat 130 feet long, with a beam
of 23 feet 6 inches and a draught of
three feet. Her motive power con
sists of two 200 horse power Win
ton engines, and she is intended for
use in Florida waters. She was de
signed by Cox & Stevens and built at
the yards of the Gas Engine and Pow
er Company, where she was launched
last week.
She is of the river steamer type,
with tunnel stern, which makes her
light draught possible, and in design
arrangement and equipment differ
largely from anything undertaken
heretofore. Her hull is built suf
ficiently strong to permit of ground
ing without injury, and her equipment
includes electric lights, hot water
heating, electric and hand capstans
and large, airy rooms.
The acommodation:7 are so out of
the ordinary as to attract special at
tention. In the hull, forward, is a
large fish well, followed by accom
modations for the negro crew, then a
large water tank, store room and the
machinery compartment.
The main, or working, deck has
the crew's mess and galley in the for
ward house, with the officers' quar
ters, rooms for pilot, fishing guides
and servants, as well as fishing tack
le, lockers, &c, in the after house, and
the small boats are carried on this
deck, thus giving the owner and his
guests the entire upper deck to them
selves. The forward house on the upper
deck includes the pilot house and j
smoking room, and then in the long ;
after house comes the dining and liv- j
ing room, above the galley, and sev
en staterooms and three bathrooms,
with a hall running fore and aft be
tween them.
This arrangement insures privacy
for the owner and his guests, and
the lofty airy and liberal accommo
dations provided make the Vagabon
dia an ideal vessel for the purpose
for which she was built. She will be
put in commission nt once.
And Calls MeetiLg of State
Democratic' Committee
October ?th.
Tampa, Sept. 28th Chairman
George P. Raney of the State Demo
cratic Committee last evening ap
pointed the State Campaign Commit
tee as follows:
W. A. Russell of Putnam county, E.
W. Davis of Orange county, R. W.
McLendon of Dade county, Robert E.
Davis of Alachua county, Carlton
Blackwell of Suwannee county, H. H.
Wells of Washington county, and J.
C. Sale of Levy county as secretary,
and Geo. P. Raney of Hillsborough
county as chairman.
Following the meeting of the State
Executive Committee at the Seminole
Hotel in Jacksonville on Saturday,
October 7th, the Campaign Committee
is to meet and make plans for con
certed action in behalf of all demo
cratic nominees. In a statement to
day Mr. Raney speaks of the effort
being made by the republican party
to take advantage of the factional
fight in the democratic party and of
the avowed intention of Rev. S. J.
Catts to run for governor without the
democratic nomination if W. V. Knott
goes on the ballot as the democratic
nominee.
The call sent out to the commit
teemen follows:
"Tampa, Fla., Sept. 27, 1916.
"Notice of call for meeting of State
Democratic Executive committee of
Florida:
"A meeting of the state democratic
executive committee of Florida is
hereby called to be held at Jackson
ville, Fla., Seminole hotel, Saturday,
October 7, at 10 o'clock in the fore
noon, for the purpose of adopting such
measures as may be proper and nec
essary to aid in the election of all
nominees of the democratic party.
"A meeting of the campaign com
mittee will Lc held at the same place
immediately on adjournment of the
state coniiniilee.
"Very truly yours,
"Geo. P. Raney.
"Chairman state demoratic execu
tive committee of Florida."
Mr.Raney's statement follows:
"It is undoubtedly the duty of the
state democratic executive commit
tee to give every assistance in its
powe" to the election of tho regular
nominees of the democratic party,
national, state and county, in the en
suing general election.
"Tho republican party encouraged
by the factional fight within the dem
ocratic party in this state is, for the
first time in many years, making a
genuine effort to become a factor in
Horiua politics.
"One contestant for the democratic
nomination has undoubtedly declared
his intention of running for governor
n the general election whether he
obtains the democratic nomination or
not; notwithstanding the fact that his
leading counsel has sated substan
tially over his own signature that ev
ery ruling made by the supreme court
of this state with respect to such
contest has been absolutely fair and
impartial, and that such counsel has
perfect confidence that future rulings
of the supreme court will be equally
fair and impartial, and the same lead
ing counsel is quoted in the press dis
patches as having voluntarily apolo
gvzed to the supreme court for the
unwarranted aspersions cast upon the
liuheiary of this state by his client.
"With the democratic party con
fronted with these conditions I deem
it mv dtitv to issue the above call for
another meeting of the committee."
