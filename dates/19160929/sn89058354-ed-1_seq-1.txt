Tennessee Christian Endeavor
ers Held Meet Here Last
Saturday
The McKenzie District of the
Tennessee Christian Endeavorers
met in their first District Con
vention here last Saturday at the
First Christian Church, About
25 delegates from the six socie
ties in the district, were present,
not including the society of the
local church.
Carl Lehmann, the All-South
C. E. Secretary, was present and
spoke twice during the day. A
program of work for the coming
year was planned for the district,
and all representatives were en
thusiastic over the bright prospects.
The McKenzie District was th
first in the state to hold a con
vention.
One year ago a five-year pro
gram was planned by the En
deavorers, which among other
things to be accomplished, in
cluded the organization of 1,000
new societies and the addition of
50,000 new members, and 30,000
new members have been en
rolled. Forty societies were or
ganized last month.
Tennessee has 164 Senior, 2$
Intermediate and 97 Junior En
deavor Societies.
noiaer in tne company, rie has
for many years been associated
with the business interests of
Henry county, starting his career
in Paris in the business house of
Quince Whittington, who a num
ber of years ago was in business
on the east side. Later he went
with the Crawford-Gatlin-Com-pany
at Puryear and was
associated with this firm for
several years, then going to
Jones' Mill where he conducted
the B. W. Potts Company's store
until it was destroyed by fire,
after which the business was
moved to Hardin and reorganized
under the name of Crawford-
Jones-Gatlin Co., with Mr. Potts
as generar manager. Under his
management the business has
grown to be one of the leading
general merchandise concerns in
this section of the country. '
The remains were carried to
his mother's home at Puryear on
Tuesday, and after funeral ser
vices conducted at the Baptist
church at that place by Rev. W.
E. Morgan, were interred at the
family burying ground at Con
yersville. The beautiful floral
offerings from numerous friends
attested the high esteem in
which he was held.

opinion on
the subject of how a wife should
be reared. '
Last Saturday night about 11
''clock, Ed M. Russell was
afcoused by the ringing of his
dojor bell, and upon investiga
tion found the Page negro on his
P0irch, and inquired what he
wknted at that time of nicrht.
The negro informed Mr. Russell
that he had been hit by Roy VaM
efltine, and fell to the floor un
conscious. Medical aid was sum
moned, and the injured negro
carried to the office of Dr. A. H.
filler, where he died about two
hours later, never regaining con
sciousness. .
It seems that Page, who is a
cousin and also brother-in-law of
Valentine, was living in the
house with the latter, and that
Valentine and his wife were in
an altercation. Page was occu
pying an adjoining room to the
negro and wife, and hearing the
row, went in and tried to effect
a settlement of the differences,
whereupon Valentine, doubtless
feeling that he could humble his
wife to his wishes without assist
ance, resented Page s offers of
arbitration, and highly ornament
al epithets were used in regard
to the latter. He resented the
insults, whereupon Valentine
dealt him his death blow with a
chair, it is said. Page, appar
ently only slightly stunned by
the blow, according to Valentine,
left the house. Doubtless real
izing that he was badly hurt, he
went to the home of Mr. Russell,
by whom he was employed, pre
sumably to enlist his services in
getting medical attention.
Valentine was taken into cus
tody Saturday night, and was
apparently much surprised to
learn. that Page was dead, hav
ing stated to the officers who ar
rested him that "he had had a
little trouble with Len, and
would fi x it up Monday morning. "

The contestants in The Pari
sian's big campaign have been
busy for .the past week, and so
much interest has been manifes
ted by some that it will be a diffi
cult matter to guess who the
winners will be.
Some of those who did not en
ter the race until a short time
ago will now be found among the
leaders, and they have surprised
us with the results they have
produced.
The race in the first district is
going to be a hot one. These
ladies are keeping right along
with one another and whoever
wins will not do so with a big
majority, The second district
contestants are also hustling and
there are a number who are run

come to a close Saturday night
It has been previously announced
that subscriptions must be turn

Kentucky Horse
Thief Arrested
Here Wednesday
W. P. Patterson was arrested
at the Fair Grounds Wednesday
by Deputy Sheriff H. E. Butler
on a fugitives warrant charged
with Horse-stealing. He was
brought to Paris and after pre
liminary hearing before Esq. W.
T. Snow was lodged in jail.
It seems that Patterson stole a
horse and buggy at some place
in Kentucky and carried it to
Hopkinsville, where he disposed
of it. The theft was not discov
ered until he had made his geta
way from the Kentucky town.
Wednesday morning Deputy
Sheriff W. N. . Porter was
"tipped" that Patterson was at
the Fair Grounds, and his arrest
by Butler followed.
He acknowledged the theft at
his preliminary hearing and
agreed to return without requi
tion papers. The Hopkinsville
chief of police arrived in Paris
Thursday and took him into cus
tody, returning to that city
Thursday evening.
A $75.00 reward was posted
for Patterson's apprehension.
and he proved a good catch for
the Paris officials.
