El Paso, Tex., Sept 84.-Clvll war la
scheduled to break out In the Kentucky
Brigade at El Paso on Monday morn
ing. Being Kentuckians, the soldiers of
that brigade are eagerly looking for
ward to the fray. Enviously, they have
been watching the Pennsylvanians
fighting among themselves, and the
members of the three Kentucky regi
ments, which are encamped northeast
of Fort Bliss, are anxious to be pitted
against each other. In other words,
Monday will be the first day of a week
of tests In the Kentucky camp. This
means that they will maneuver under
the observance of regular army offic
ers. One-half of the brigade will attack
the other half under war conditions. ;
Possibly the boys will discharge
some blank ammunition at each other
to make the tests more realistic. The
Pennsylvanians have burned up sev
eral million rounds and, theoretically,
several regiments of Pennsylvania sol
diers have been annihilated. Theo
retically, thousands of the Keystone
men were killed and burled last week,
but the beauty of this kind of warfare
is that there Is no one absent when
mess call is sounded. .
