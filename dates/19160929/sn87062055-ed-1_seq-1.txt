MORE WORDS-NO BACON
Senator Henry F. Ashurst spoke to
a good sized audience at the court
house last Monday evening, the regu
lar meeting of the Flagstaff Demo
cratic Club having been given over
for the occasion.
The senator denied that this was a
free trade country but his vote an the
present tariff for revenue bill showed
that ho favored free wool and the rest
of the long list of goods that are now
upon it; and the high cost of living
that the democrats were going to
remedy so quickly by the present law,
was not mentioned.
There were several thing he did not
mention that the people would like
to have heard about, especially as to
whether he now agrees with the sen
ate on conference reports, notwith
standing the' objections of the secre
tary of the interior, and whether the
Congressional Record of May 5th,
1916, correctly quotes the running
fire of sarcasm directed at him from
both republicans and democrats, who
wanted to know who gave him the
right to change the will or the senate
on a conference report.
Senator Ashurst Mid not mention
his now famous "cascaret" speech
made before the high school students
of Lexington, Ohio, November 24th,
1915, which was printed in the Con
gressional Record by special leave,
which read in part: "Teach me that
all success and every livable condition
of life come only from constant en
deavor and long sustained effort;
teach me that to succeed I must sub
ject myself to the fierce fires of in
tellectual and physical endeavor; that
I must walk while others 4ride; and
like "Cascarets," I must work while
others sleep."
He" did, however, advise the people
that they had not agitated the new
postofflce long enough, consequently
the people now realize that they
should have agitated the question for
itho' past, five years or more, that the
bill introduced in congress hid been
introduced merely for the purpose of
quieting the "agitation." The merits
of the case does not seem to enter in
to the question at all.
If the solid vote of Flagstaff was
registered against Ashurst and Hay
den this fall, it might bring to their
attention that the agitation they were
up against, was some of the real ag
grivated sort and the kind that counts
in securing the things the people bad
ly need. '
One senator can not do it all, but if
we are to believe all things Senator
Ashurst has claimed that he did dur
ing the past session of congress, the
mere pittance of a postoffice would
have been as nothing to him, with his
great power as a "national leader."
Senator Ashurst's address was a
pleasant one, but not one that will at
all hoodwink the people of Flagstaff
'as to what he has actually accomplish
ed for them. The people have come
to believe in the man who brings in
'the "bacon" when it is most needed,
not a mouthful of words.
HERMAN BUILDING
WILL BE TWO STORIES
The plans of the new Herman
Company building on San Francisco
street have been changed from a one
story building to a two story build
ing. The lower floor will be used by the
company on one side and the other
side leased. The upper story will be
used for office rooms in front with a
big lodge room and dance floor in the
rear. Office rooms are at a premium
as are all business buildings in Flag
staff. Many business concerns who
would establish a business here are
unable to do so owing to the lack of
locations.
Just which way the business section
of the town will break out in the
next year or so is a question, but
there is an undercurrent of feeling
that it will break somewhere soon and
' the town will move along in that
'direction. The present business dis
trict is overcrowded; things are mov
ing and the break is liable to come
where least expected, as it usually
does.
Eat Less and Pay More
The cost of living this winter will
reach an unprecedented scale, accord
ing to merchants and producers.
Canned fruits will show a 30 per cent
increase, canned vegetables 20 per
cent, cotton goods 25 to 35 cent,
women's shoes will double in cost and
collars will bo 15 cents straight.
Laundries today announced an in
crease in the collar price of from 2
to 3 cents, and cigar Jobers have
raised prices to between $4 and $5
per 1,000 to dealers.
JEALOUS MEXICAN WOMAN
ATTEMPTS
Clavcra Lopez, a young und good
looking Mexican woman attempted to
kill a couple other Mexican girls yes
terday forenoon by shooting them.
She was desperately in earnest in her
attempt and may have succeeded had
sho not been caught by City Marshal
Murray as she started to shoot the
second time.
She met the girls as they came
across the street on Railroad avenue
and snapped a 38 calibre revolver at
them a couple times. She stopped to
see what the matter was with the
gun and accidently discharged it,
then started again to do mu.dcr
when caught by Officer Murray and
disarmed.
Just what caused the insane act of
Jealousy no one seemed to know.
The woman has been living in Flag
staff for the past four years.
She was first lodged in the city Jail
and afterwards taken to the county
Jail.

bad gash that would heal up in a rea
sonable time.

the Prcscott National Forest, in com
pany with Mr. F. S. Veile, and R. S.
Masson of the Arizona Power Com

visit to Flagstaff and he was well
pleased with what little he saw of It
during his short stay.

twenty-four hours the same chunk of
land had been transfered to Samsky

selves a plumbing shop on the land
acquired. The footage in question is
up tho alley from Aspen avenue, on
ground that the old building used as

street from the Babbitt Bros, store on San Francisco street, if reasonable
arrangements can be made with the postoffice department.
COMES NEAR DEATH
FROM NERETE MIXER
J. B. Hancock, an employee of the
California-Arizona Construction Com
pany, was dangerously cut about the
head yesterday afternoon by the big
elevator on the concrete mixing ma
chine, which was being moved to the
Santa Fe freight house for shipment.
The big iron coop-like affair had
been moved around on Railroad ave-,
nue in front of Jones' pool nail, wfien
the elevator fell, striking Hancock on
the head, cutting a deep gasTTand ex
tending from the back of the head, to
over his eye and face.
With a stream of blood running
from his head, he was taken to Dr.
Mannings' office, where it was found
that he had been partially scalped,
with an ugly gash running down over
his eye, his nose flattened across his
face and several of the smaller arte
ries were cut.
The elevator probably had Jarred
loose from its holdings while being
moved over the rough bit of street,
causing the accident.
STREET PAVING COMPLETED
FOR THE PRESENT SEASON
Jack Morton, chief prophet of the
California-Arizona Construction Com
pany, came in Saturday from L03
Vegas, N. M., where he has been look
ing after more street paving con
tracts. The paving equipment will be
moved from Flagstaff this week to
Los Vegas where he secured a con
tract for paving. This means that
Frew-thc-red-Morton, who supervises
the smearing of the earth with the
goo called "bitulithic;" Sid-the-J-Gass-man,
paper pilot, including
Johnson, the boss muckraker, will hie
themselves to a more saluberious
clime along with the rest of the
machinery.
While they have ripped up the
streets and discommoded traffic all
summer, the bunch will go away with
a whole lot of friends, and but few,
if any complaints as to the quality of
the work they have done for the
property owners of the city. That they
are heartless, it is true, for they left
them here.
Ideal Hotel Changes Hands
The Ideal hotel, one of the best
equipped of the smaller hotels of the
city, was leased this week by Mrs.
Eric Denver to Mr. C. H. Webb, an
old hotel man of Santa Fc, N. M., who
will take charge of the place the first
of the month and endeavor to make
it one of the popular houses of the
city.
Mr. Webb's family will arrive in
Flagstaff from Santa Fe Monday.
Mr. Wehb has only been in Flagstaff
a short time but in that time has been
convinced that there are many oppor
tunities here that have been overlook
ed by the people, and, in throwing
in his lot with Flagstaff, expects to
help make it grow.
Died at County Hospital
W. M. McBaker died at the county
hospital Sunday night from natural

PROCHASKA WILL WIN
BIG IN GILA
Globe, Ariz., Sept. 27. "We are
sending Joe V. Prochaska, Gila coun
ty's candidate for secretary of state,
away on his. state-wide campaign with
a majority of 2,000 -votes in his own
county," declared R. E. Merritt, secre
tary of the Gila County Republican
Central Committee this afternoon.
j And the declaration of MrMerritt
appears to be the tirevailing opinion
among the big majority of voters in
Gila county. In fact, so strong is the
Prochask'a sentiment here that it
seems as though partisanship has
been placed in the discard.
Miners, bankers, cattlemen, and
men in every other walk of life are
pledging themselves to support him.
They are all intensely interested in
his election, maintaining that this im
portant state office needs a "business
administration" and that Joe V. Pro
chaska, with a highly successful busi
ness career of 16 years in this state,
is the man who is best qualified to
render this service to the state.
Politicians who arc familiar with
county conditions declare that the
name of Joe V. Prochaska on the
November ballot will- carry through
Tom Campbell, Judge Kibbey and the
balance of the republicans with hand
some majority in Gila county.

CHAIRMAN HADDOCK SURE
CAMPBELL IS THE WINNER
Thomas Maddock, chairman of tho
republican state central committee,
was in Flagstaff from Phoenix last
Friday on political business and to
interview the leading republicans in
this end of the state.
Mr. Maddock is enthusiastic in his
belief that it is more of a republican
year than the people generally think,
and that there is going to be a real
surprise party in store for the dem
ocracy when the votes are counted
this fall.
"Tom Campbell is a sure winder for
governor. He has been receiving en
couragement on all sides since the
close of the primaries, from dem
ocrats and republicans alike, from all
parts of the state. Kibbey has start
ed out on a whirl-wind tour and is
handing out facts straight from the
shoulder and is convincing the voters
of the righteousness of his cause
wherever he goes," said Maddock.
TADDY TIN MURDER TRIAL
STILL ON AT PRESCDTT
Returning witnesses from the fa
mous Taddy Tin murder trial which
has taken up the greater part of the
week in the federal court at Prescott,
say that it may reach a conclusion to
day. The last Indian witness was on
the stand yesterday, afternoon.
A sensation was created by the
Judge in fining two of the govern
ment witnesses $500 for contempt of
court and assessing a like fine on At
torney E. S. Clark, for the defense.
Just how the contempt was commit
ted was not clearly stated.
The case will probably go to the
jury today. No further information
concerning the case could be secured
late last night by wire.
WINSLOW POSTMASTER
MAKES NEW OFFICE RULES
William "Bill" Daze Jr., who does
the postmastering for the people of
Winslow, the city located east of the
Santa Fe roundhouse, was in Flag
staff Sunday, the guest of his brother
Joe Daze, the young man who takes
in the round dollars for the Santa Fe
here. Postmaster Daze has estab
lished new rules at his office and now
refuses to lick any stamp for patrons
of his office under the,, ten cent deno
mination; post cards containing over
100 words will not be read at his office.
Stamps, he says, may be purchased
dluring office hours without making
an appointment a day ahead; dead
letters are promptly burried; every
thing but a voter is registered at the
registry window. The office has
grown so since he took hold that it
was necessary to discard the old
rooster with ink on his feet to do the
cancelling of stamps.
Another novation he made, was in
having on hand a select package of
love letters for the ladies who are ex
pecting a letter "that he said he
would write as soon as he got home,
and ain't here yet.". This has been a
grave fault with many postoffices. He
had a nice new door mat with "wel
come" on it, which lasted quite a
while, but eventually the school chil
dren kicked the 'well"out of it, and
he pointed the "come" toward the
door.
Examining Crater Lake
For Eastern Capitalists
Mr. Frank J. Irving, representing
Chicago capitalists, is in Flagstaff
this week looking over the Coconino
Water Co. project with a view of re
porting conditions to interested par
ties east. The project, or'rather the

known as Spencer's Crater Lake en
terprise, which has surprised all old
timers with results produced at such
little cost.
An engineer is expected out from
Chicago within a few days to make
an investigation of the works for the
company and upon his report depends
whether or not they will take over the
project.
SELLS BUSINE3S PROPERTY

New York store on Railroad avenue,
sold his property on San Francisco
street last week to the Miguel Broth
ers, who havp been conducting a pool
room in the .place for the past year.
It is the building formerly owned by
Frank Payne. The building was sold
for $6,500.
Mr. Nackard had intended to re
model the place and add a story to it,
but owing to his accident this spring
in which his ankle was badly fract

-OLD YELLOW HATS ARE
SPYING ON AUTO DRIVERS
Police Judge Layton had a
number of interesting cases be-
fore him yesterday morning, in
which automobile owners played
the star roles. Some were ar-5-
lested on charge of leaving muf-
flers open on their cars, others
others for going a leedle bit too
fast along the street and some
5- for being earless of the "old
5 yellow hats" in the intersections
J- of tho streets, where they were
supposed to go around to the
right, but did not have time.
5 It is some annoying to be corn
's pelled to kow-tow to an old yel--S
low hat, but somehow the old hat
5 seems to find out when the auto
5 driver is"not playing the game
on the square. It would be no
more than fair to have four
eyes painted on the yellow
5 boys in order that drivers may
5- be warned that the durned things
8- are looking all the time.
