TO BE MADE BY COUNTY IN PRY
TAX REFUNDMENT
CASE
At the coining" term of the Minneso
ta State Supreme court, which begins
I lie first of October, County Attorney
•C. Ivosenmeier will make an appeal
1'roin t'he decision of Judge J. A. Roes
er of the district court of this dis
trict, in the case of J. J. Fry vs. The
County of Morrison, ©t al.
This case involves the refunding of
payments on ditch taxes made by Mr.
Try after the ditch had been knocked
out. Mr. Fry bought a tax certificate
:i number of years ago and after he
purchased it lie paid the taxes on it
for eight or ten years, including a
part of the assessments for a ditch
known as Ditch No. 12. Six or seven
years ago this ditch was knocked out
Aliy
The sum i* not large, only about.
but the principle involved is of
considerable importance and the coun
ty is anxious to get a ruling from the
-state supreme court on it as a decision
lias never been rendered by that body
on a question of this kind. If the
nnaii were owner of the land there
ji -would be no question about the mat
ter, as the state supreme court has
held that money so paid by a land
owner cannot be recovered. In the
is case of a person holding a tax certifi
cate there may be some difference,
liowever and a ruling will be worth
having.
:j One reason why the county does not
feel that it is fair to refund money in
I this manner is that tax certificates
could be purchased in the same anan
Ik nor as by Mr. Fry and could be held
•3r tor years and a high rate of interest
•collected on them.

ED BY LATE JOSIAH PAGE,
NOW IN OPERATION
Josirtb Page, one of the early set
tlers of Morrison county and who for
several years prior to his death made
his home in Little Falls, in making
out his last will and testament, de
creed that a part of his estate should
revert to charity, especially for the
relief of the poor of Little Falls, and
that a specified sum be set aside for
the purpose of installing a clock in
the county court house. When thel
estate was probated and all specific
claims nettled there remained approxi
mately $700, which was turned over to
the city of Little Falls and which was
bv the fitv council created into a per
manent Page memorial fund.
The tequest to the county for the
clock was $2,000 ami with interest
amouii'iis to $2,015. For this amount
the county commissioners purchased a
clock for the court house from the E.

the tcp-most part of the tower and
there is a dial on each side of the
tower. The dials are of metal and
are six and one-lialf feet in diameter.

on the farm, experiencing many hard

bequ'esT-s will stand out as a lasting
memorito him.
Most of those who have seen the
clock in the tower are of the opinion
that it should be higher up and some
local business men have intimated
that if necessary they will be willing
to contribute toward a fund to have
the tower made higher and to get a
different set of dials, which can be il
luminated at night, and which wil also
"•be larger. It is possible that some of
thiei business men will appear before
the county commissioners at their
meeting Tuesday in an effort to have
the change made.
WILL VOTE ON BONDS AGAIN
Holdingford Advertiser: The inde
if pendent school district at Lpsala de
ll feated the proposition for $20,000
bonds last week by 14 votes. Some of
/he voters wanted* to raise the amount
'at once and save the interest. They
evidently were not well informed as to
what can be done in the way of rais
ing public funds. The school board
lias called another election for October
2. It is not likely that the people of
that place, who were intelligent enough
to organize for the purpose of securing
better schools, will vote against the
bonds twice.

EXPECT VICTORY FOR DOME
SIXTH DISTRICT DEMOCRATIC
CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE
CONFIDENT OF SUCCESS
Basing their belief on the unques
tioned ability and the exceptional pop
ularity of their nominee and on the
fact that there is a great increase in
the number of thinking, independent
voters, Sixth district democrats are
confidently prophesying victory in the
coming congressional election. Believ
ing that the goal is within reach, dem
ocratic leaders are beginning the most
active campaign of recent years. The
committee in charge of the campaign
has issued the following statement as
its opening gun:
"In presenting to the voters of the
Sixth congressional district, Hon. Wil
liam F. Donohue of Melrose, the dem
ocratic congressional and general ad
visory committee do so with pride in
their candidate and confidence in the
outcome of the November election.
"Mr. Donohue was moved to file for
the office of congressman by an insist
ent united demand from his party and
many men of other political organiza
tions. Recognizing his solid worth as
a citizen and his eminent fitness to
represent the people of the district, no
other democrat offered himself for the
nomination and Mr. Donohue was giv
en the unanimous, enthusiastic support
of all the voters of his party at the
primary.
"He has now set for himself the
pleasant task of meeting the voters
of the district and declaring his atti
tude on all public questions. Tljat he
is meeting with a cordial reception is
matter of genuine satisfaction to Mr.
Donohue and cause for congratulation
to his committee.
"William F. Donohue combines,
practically every element desired in
the making of an ideal congressman.
He has had a long and honorable pub
lic career while still in years a com
paratively young man. He has been a
members of the Minnesota legislature,
1899-1901 county attorney of Stearns
county for two terms, 1901-1905 can
didate of his party for attorney gen
eral of Minnesota, 1912, and delegate
to the national convention of the dem
ocratic party, 1916.
"He has long enjoyed a splendid
legal practice in his own and neighbor
ing counties and is rightfully considered
one of the leading members of the bar
in Minnesota. In his home city his
standing is unquestioned. He has been
president of the Melrose board of edu
cation for many years and there are
no better public schools in any country
than at Melrose. The head' of a fine
family, his home life is ideal.
"His attitude on public questions is
that of a progressive democrat. He
stands for a square deal between the
governors and the governed he be
lieves that representatives are sent to
congress to guard the interest of their
constituents. Donohue has no entangl
ing corporation alliances. If elected,
he will be responsible to no one but
the plain people of the Sixth district
their will and theirs alone will be his
guide in his public actions.
William F. Donohue's fitness for
the high office to which he aspires is
conceded. That he will prove a fitting
successor to any of the able men who
have preceded him in congress his com
mittee believes, and, believing, invites
to his candidacy the support of the
voters of the Sixth congressional dis
trict of Minnesota."

FIVE NT BOIGLASS W»
FOUR UNDER 12 YEARS AND ONE
16 CONFESS TO BURGLARIES
AT PIERZ
As' a result of a dealer at Pierz sus
pecting that a young boy who came to
his store to purchase a gun, had se
cured the money by means otherwise
than honest, knowing his circumstan
ces, a gang of five young boys, four of
whom were 12 years of age and under,
and the fifth 16, confessed to thefts
at the P. A. Hartmann store at Pierz
in which they had secured sums of
money amounting to several hundred
dollars. All of the money that was
stolen has been or will be recovered
and some checks that were taken and
were destroyed can be replaced by new
checks.
The burglaries were committed on
three occasions covering a period of
several weeks. The last one, and which
resulted in the boys' arrest, was per
petrated at the Hartmann store, on
Suniday morning, while Mr. Hartmann
was at- church. They secured $96 and
some merchandise. On the 10th of
this month the four youngest boys
stile $22 at the same place. On an
other occasion one of the boys stole
some money from his father's store
and gave it to the oldest boy of the
gang, as hush money.
The boys were brought before Judge
Lyon in municipal court for their hear
ing Monday afternoon. Although
these were reformatory offenses, be
cause of their age and in view of the
fact that this was their first offense,
the boys were let off with a fine. Each
one was assessed $15 and costs, total
ing $40, in addition to returning the
stolen money and goods. Four of the
boys were charged with robbery and
the fifth with accepting stolen money.

PRISON LAUDED BY VASALY
BOARD OF CONTROL MEMBER
CITES WHAT MINNESOTA IS
DOING TO HELP CONVICTS
Stillwater, Sept. 25.—"The prison
should be a place of social change. The
offender must feel not that the mighty
structure of society is against him,
but its forces are directed toward
helping anl\restoring him."
This was the declaration of Charles
E. Vasaly of St. Paul, member of the
state board of control, in an address
late today before the state conference
of charities and corrections, in session
here.
Outlines Minnesota Work
He outlined some of the tihings Min
nesota is doing for its prisoners as
follows:
Factories which have produced 250,
000,000 pounds of grain binding twine
since their establishment in 1801, at
a saving to farmers of $7,500,000 and
earnings to prisoners varying from 15
cents a day to $1.50.
Machinery plants which last year
manufactured 16,000 machines, includ
ing 3,700 binders and 5,000 mowers,
and which provide means of learning
the trades of molder, blacksmith,
painter, machinist and woodworker.
A school with tri-weekly sessions.
A library of 7,000 volumes, with a
Chautauqua circle of entertainment.
Reformers Cloud Results
"We do not need in Minnesota to
be told there are tremendous possibili
ties in prison work," Mr. Vasaly said.
"So-ealled reformers who seek the
lipielight before the result of their ex
periments is known and who have pro
claimed anew gospel of prison reform
with the same unction as though they
had rediscovered the commandments,
have obscured with the public the
work done for years in this and other
prisons by the real pioneers of prison
reform.''

COMMISSION CUTS VALUATION
STATE BOARD REDUCES ACREAGE
VALUATION OF COUNTY
NEARLY $74,000
Morrison county's assessed! valuation
took quite a slump when the Minneso
ta State Tax commission, the last
board to examine the assessments,
sliced off 10 per cent or nearly $74,000
from the real estate acreage. Audi
tor McNairy has just received notice
of the commission's action.
The total valuation in this county,
outside of the cities and villages, is
about $7,400,000. The valuation in
this county on acreage was far above
that of other counties in its class, the
commission said, and t!he reduction
brings it about equal with the others.
The reduction is only on acreage and
does not affect the cities and villages
of the county.
MOTLEY MAN IS "DLACK DIA
MOND TRAIL" TRUSTEE
Sherman W. Jacobs of Motley waa
selected trustee from Morrison county
for the new Black Diamond Trail from

Wadena. In Morrison, Cass and Crow
Wing counties the route will be select

a northern and a southern, having
been advocated.
Local motorists are heartily in fav

this county another good stretch of
road in the northern part and it will
also furnish a fine triangle route from
this city to Staples and Brainerd and
back.
