GILSON GARDNER IN
TACOMA SAYS COAST
IS ALL FOR WILSON
By Mabel Abbott
An interesting person was in The Times of
fice today.
Do you remember, about seven years ngo,
when President Taft had been In office about
a year and his strenuous predecessor in
Africa for about the same length of time, the
condition of mental strain and nervous ten
sion the whole country had got Into, wonder
ing what the mighty hunter would say when
he came hack and took a look at things?
00 you remember how the excitement grew
until It became unbearable and we simply
11AO to know —and yet we couldn't find out?
And do you remember how, Into the midst
of this agony of suspense there burst forth
a PERSONAL, INTERVIEW with Col. Roose
velt?
A newspaper man had gone to Africa to
get that interview.
He had gone by the regular routes until
the regular routes gave out, nnd then he
chartered a steamer and pushed on up the
Nile on the trail of the mighty hunter, until
at last he found him, in Central Africa, told
him the situation, got his statement and sent
it out by a naked, coal-black Soudanese sav
age.
Memorable Feat
The operator who cabled It could not under
stand English, <md the newspaperman printed
the message laboriously by hand, so the oper
ator could send It letter by letter without un
derstanding what the words meant.
The achievement was and still remains one
of the greatest feats In newspaper history.
Also it changed the whole political situa
tion — hut that's another story.
The man who got the interview was Gilson
Gardner, of the Newspaper Enterprise Associ
ation.
And it was Gilson Gardner who was in The
Times office today.
For the Newspaper Enterprise Association
is the agency that keeps The Times and Its
sister papers supplied with big features from
all over the world; and Gardner is the man
whose stories are just now keeping Times'
readers up to date In the presidential cam
paign.
He stuck his head ln at the door of the ed
itorial room—a small, quiet, unobtrusive man
—and asked if the editor w-as In.
1 thought he was somebody with a favor to
ask; he seemed so anxious not to Interrupt.
He Is swinging around the circle, sizing up
state after state with his trained observation,
and when he got this far, he dropped ln to
say "Hello." He said it modestly, as if not
certain that anybody would want to waste
any time on him.
Acrobatic Matter
I watched him from my comer, wondering
what it felt like to he as big a newspaper
man as Gilson Gardner, and whether- he
writes his big, forceful stories the least bit
the same way that other reporters write their
dally stints, and whether he ever has troable
thinking of Ihe right word.
And next thing I knew, the editor was ask
ing him to write a story specially for The
'limes, and he was saying "Yes," and there
was a call for a stenographer. And in about
a minute 1 saw Gilson Gardner at work.
He twisted and untwisted his legs and
squirmed. Sometimes he gripped the seat of
his chair with both hands and held on tight,
as If It were bucking.
Sometimes he hugged himself and swayed
backward and forward ag if ln great pain.
Sometimes he paused and thought for a
moment, and made faces. He dictated about
as fast as a business man would dictate a let
ter. He never changed a word or a sen
.tence.
You will find his story, ln the form of an
interview, right alongside this sketch, it ifl
plain and unostentatious as the little man
who stuck his head Into the door of tbe editor
ial room of The Times today; and as straight
forward and authoritative as the correspond
ent who followed Roosevelt to the middle of
the African continent to get the story the
world wanted.

By Gilson Gardner.
' I think Wilson lias a very gtxxl chance
to carry the Pacific Coast states of Cali
fornia, Oregon and Washington.
Predictions hased on 'politics! form'
seem likely to give way to predictions
based on what the independent voter may
be expected to do,
The ifldepindent voter seems to be in
clining very strongly to Wilson. 'J he
psychology of this appears to be the con
viction that Wilson is the more independ
ent and more radical of the two presidentl
ial candidates. Hughes may be conceded
to be a fine man. with a fine judicial tem
perament, but the ex-progressives and in
dependent volers do not think Hughes
would give the country things like the
Braudeis appointment to the supreme
court, the child-labor bill, the rural credits
law, tlie eight-hour law for railway em
ployes, and a score of others.
Another thing which is figuring very
largely in this election is the peace senti
ment. The woman vote is notably in
favor of Wilson's peace policy, rerson
ally, 1 think the men's vote can be includ
ed quite considerable in this.
The situation in California is interest
ing. The progressives under Hiram
Johnson cleaned up the old standpat
Southern Pacific crowd, and Johnson will
carry his state by tbe biggest majority
seen there in the history of the state. The
Johnson following, however, is not doing
much for Hughes.
Similar Here
In Washington, Ihe situation is sonic
thing similar, with the difference that
Pnindexter does not control the situation
as does Johnsi>n. It appears to he conced
ed that Pnindexter will win, and his. vic
tory will help Hughes; hut whether it will
influence enough votes to pull Hughes
through is very doubtful.
Much de|>ends on the labor vote, and
in other parts of the country I find this is
almost solid for Wilson.
Much depends also on the city of Se
attle. The election in Washington state,
it seems, will lie won or lost in Seattle. If
there is a vigorous campaign, that city
ought to give Wilson a winning margin.
Personally. I am very much pleased at
the victory of Poindexter in the primar
ies. I have watched his career in Wash
ington for six years, and can say with the
greatest sincerity that he is one of the
most useful men from the people's point
of view in either branch of congress. 'Ihe
kind of senator who will serve the public
and not special privilege is sufficiently
scarce to warrant the return of a man with
the kind of record Poindexter has.
' The situation in Oregon is more fa
vorable to Wilson, possibly, than in
Washington. There is no Poindexter
there to help Hughes, and standing on his
own legs, he will have trouble beating
Wilson.
I have talked with managers at both
republican ami democratic headquarters,
(and the democrats seem to be the more
confident. This would not indicate any
thing if they had not polls and other
things to go on. There have been very
few accurate jkills taken anywhere, but
such as there are indicate a close race,
with Wilson rather in the lead.

The police did not leave a

Everything was placed in

At 8 o'clock Friday morning
Rosellini was caught hy two of

Investigation showed the whis
ky to he oj' exactly the same
brand as that contained in the big
carload of "grapes" seized by
county officers at Wllkeson Mon
day.
Following a raid on the Mar
coni place, Roselllnl was arrest
ed earlier in the week, but was
discharged In police court two
days ago when the witness who
claimed to have bought booze
there failed to identify him posi
tively as the man who sold It.
Arrested For Speeding.
Since then Police Detective Os

Howard have been watching the
Roselllnl home night and day.
Friday morning they saw hltn
drive up in a machine aud take
the three gunny sacks Into the
house. Then he drove off.
So as not to arouse suspicion,
Howard followed him and arrest
ed him for speeding. After he
had been taken to the police sta
tion the officers went back to tha
house. A search showed that
the sacks were full of 66 pint
bottles of the bonded goods.
The police claim to have evi
dence that Roselllnl Is a member
of the booze syndicate. They as
sert that he has repeatedly
brought auto loads of booze from
a cache In the West End, and be
lieve that he has a carload of the
stuff hidden somewhere.

Rosell.nl is said to be a whole
saler, peddling to "bootleggers,"
who in turn sell the pint bottles
for a high figure.
Rosellinl's automobile, a new
Ford, was confiscated by the po
lice on the grounds that It was
used for Illegal transportation of
liquor.
The prisoner was released at
noon on $525 cash ball.
Attorney J. F. O'Brien, repre

would defend the saloon man by
claiming that Roselllnl had the
liquor in his possession before
Jan. 1.
In a recent Seattle case, the
supreme court upheld a man
whose home was raided for hav
ing an illegal amount of boo/.e.
"We will show that Roselllnl
is making a business of handling
liquor on a big scale," said Chief
Harry Smith. "He has the stuff
hidden, and the very fact that he
is transporting It secretively la
evidence that he la doing some
thing illegal."

DRAKE SUIT
IS ON TODAY
That the city lias full jurisdic
tion to impeach Commissioner
Drake and that the recall law in
no way invalidates the right of re
moval from office given In the
city charter was the argument of
City Attorney Harmon ln Superior
Judge Clifford's court Friday.
The hearing wus on tbe at
tempt ol Drake aud hie attorneys
to get an order from the court
permanently restraining the city
council from voting on the im-
I peacliinent.
Drake's contention is that the
recall law took away the charter
rights of impeachment.
In answer to this. Attorney
Harmon cited part of the recall
law which states specifically that
Its purpose was primarily to
place additional power of removal
in the hands of the people.
His argument was that the re
call merely gives the people the
power to remove a public officer
when the city council refuses to
act.
When It was learned that the
council intended to vote on
Drake's impeachment, Drake ob
tained a writ of prohibition
from tlie court
The city Friday also made a
motion to i|na:.h this writ. The
only thing a layman could un
derstand about the argument on
this motion was the word "pro
hibition." It was dry stuff.
