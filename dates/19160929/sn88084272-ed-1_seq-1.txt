Presidential Electors Chos

the Progressives.
Saratoga Springs, 5t. T Sept. 29.
Republicans in state conference here
adopted Thursday night a platform en
dorsing and supporting every stand
Charles E. Hugbes has taken In his
campaign and endorsing Gov. "Whit
man's administration.
Prior to the final business session of
the conference, the state committee se
lected presidential electors. Contrary
to expectations, no Progressive were
nominated. Vacancies were left in six
congressional districts, however ami
members or that party may be selected
to fill these.
Coalition Ticket Favored.
It had been expected that at least six
Progressives would be named and that
the Progressive state committee would
endorse the coalition ticket and fail to
place a ticket of their own in the field.
However, word reached Republican
state chairman Tanner, late in the day.
that the Progressives then requested
eight places on the ticket. He declined
to grant this and the committee ad
journed to meet again in New York Oc

Condemn Adamson Law.
Besides praising the presidential and
gubernatorial candidates for the party
the platform declared for a resubmis
sion of the woman suffrage plank in
1917, condemned the national defence

seiuuors
to filabuster "to the last
oitcn against tne passage of the ad
amson eight hour law, passed to avert
the threatened railroad strike. The
nominee declared he did not believe in
filibustering, for one thing; and that if
the majority in congress had deter
mined to pass the bill there was no rea
son whatever why its passage should
have been delated by filibustering tac
tics. "It the administration) acted with
swiftness." Mr. Hughes said, "and it
cannot now plead that a Republican
candidate 1000 miles away should have
saved It from carrying out its fixed de
termination." Rends Prevlonn Correspondence.
The nominee read to the convention
correspondence between chairman New

merce committee. Harry A. Wheeler,
chairman of the committee on railroad
situation of the chamber of commerce
of the United States and president Wil

president, but he was addressed in the
correspondence, to uphold his conten
tion that 3000 firms and corporations
in the country had asked the president
to take action before the threatened
strike situation became acute. Mr.
Hughes also quoted an extract from the
president's address to congress on the
subject to support his claim that the
bill should not have been passed.

Prohibition Candidate Says
Liquor Destines Children
To Ruination.
Rawlins. "Wye Sept. 19 Wrong that
liquor has done children is the prime
reason for X Frank Hanly making a
fight for the presidency this year on
the Prohibition ticket, he told Wyom
ing crowds today, on his way to Den
ver where he speaks tonight.
"About the extent and character of
that wrong I do not guess." he said.
"For four years, as the executive of a
great commonwealth, I made it by busi
ness to know. For four years I walked
the corridors and tarried iu the wards
or hospitals, reformatories and pris
ons and became familiar with tne
tragic story tbelr records told.
"In my state today there are little
more than 1000 children less than 1R
years of age under the correctional
care of the commonwealth.
They 'Neier Had a Chance.
"They never had a chance- they never
knew a square deal, for the records
show that 640 of them have, or have
had. drunken fathers or mothers, or
both. Their destiny was fixed from the
beginning a state institution, hos
pital, reformatory, prison, the electric
chair or the gallows. I never left the
presence of these children that the soul
of me did not cry out that a great,
free, powerful people out not to license
and legalize a thing that so wrongs a
childhood they began."
Wyoming is wet and no dry propo
sal Is before the people. Some of the
drys hope, however, that with the aid
of the suffrage vote, they win make it

EASY TO KEEP OUT OF
WAR, SAYS FAIRBANKS
Pueblo. Colo Sept. 39. "It's an easy
matter to keep out of war when there
is no one who wants to fight us and
when we do not want to fight anyone,
was the answer of Charles W. Fair
banks, as to why president Wilson has
kept the United States out of war.
"There is not a nation In the world
that has wanted to engage In war with
us," he said. "We have been at war
with Mexico and if president Wilson
had recognized Huerta he would have
restored peace in that republic and it
would not have been necessary for the
expenditure of millions to protect our
border or to have shed human blood.
Wilson invaded Mexico at Veracruz and
the reason the war has not been greater
is because Mexico was not greater.
