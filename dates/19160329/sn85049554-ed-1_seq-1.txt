American Survivors Improving.
Washington, MarcAi 29.—The British
horseship Englishman was A rat shelled
and then torpedoed by a German sub
marine, according to affidavits made
to American representatives at Liver
pool by three American survivors.
Officials said it seemed clear that the
Englishman tried to escape as Inferred
by officials here from the dispatch.
The German government has been
asked whether any of Its submarines
were concerned in the sinking of the
Englishman or the damaging of the
British channel ship Sussex.
While It Is Indicated that the case
of the Englishman may not lead to
difficulties between the United States
and Germany if it is proved she was
escaping, over-night dispatches from
Dover seem to bear out the previous
assertion that the Sussex was tor
pedoed.
Affldsvits Secured.
American consular representatives,
it was said in the dispatches, had
secured affidavits from survivors at
Dover. The state department expects
to receive from Ambassador Gerard at
Berlin some time today or tonight the
result of his Inquiry at the German
foreign office Into the circumstances
surrounding the damaging of the Sus
sex and the sinking of the English
man.
Dispatches from Dover today said
Wilder Penfleld and Joshua D. Arml
tage, American survivors of the Sus
sex, were Improving.
George H. Crocker, another Ameri
can, is seriously injured and his rela
tives in the United States and Eng
land have been notified of his condi
tion.
Information Indefinite.
Information received by the state
department does not disclose whether
the Englishman was torpedoed before
or after she had stopped. Reports, in
dicate Bhe had attempted to escape but
had abandoned the attempt. Officials
here say that if the vessel had indi
cated her Intention of stopping she
was entitled to Immunity from attack
even tho she had at first attempted to
escape.
President Wilson discussed the sub
marine situation at length today with
