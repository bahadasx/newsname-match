What do you know about them—the big

are, in a series beginning today, on page 5.
"The stranger it desperately ill and in his delirium touet a number of $20 gold pieces about. Th-y are spurious." So reads a line in "A Siren of the Snows," the new book-length novel, by Stan>
ley Shaw, to appear complete in six installments, beginning in Monday's Star. This is the best story, we think, that The Star has off?red thus far. It tells how a secret service man is put on the trail of a
gang of counterfeiters. A clew lead* Him into the wilds of Canada. There he meets the s«ren. What happened after that -and things did happen thick and fast—you will read in the story beginning
Monday. It ia one of the greatest tales of love, intrigue and mystery ever written. Read the first installment. You'll hardly be able to wait for the next five.

(Prison Ufa—the gray, drab, aomber existence of human beinga
within tha walla of the penitentiary—waa the experience sought by E.
A. Patera, a reporter on the Taeoma Ttiriee. Pretending to be a
forgar who waa permitted to traval to the prison without a guard, he
entered tha Walla Walla Inatt-vtion. to learn "from the inside" what
ever an obaarvlng young man could. Ha stayed three daya befora
Warden Drum discovered ha waa not a real convict. Today The Star
publlahea Peters' first article on his atrange adventure. Tha Star 1a

By E. A. Peters
A newly arrived prisoner at the Walla Walla penitentiary
many year* ago had just been stripped, bathed, attired in
convict clothing and placed in a cell to await further exam
ination.
A trusty slipped silently to the cell door.
"What're you in for. bo?" he whispered, between lips
♦hst moved so imperceptibly no guard could have dctectrq .
the motion.
"Highway robbery—and didn't have seixe enough to get
away," was the dejected answer.
"Well, you Mire were a sucker to get caught."
"I was a fi«ih--a poor fKh." came from the cell.
• • • • •
For three days I have been a "fish."
Not because I was a "sucker to get caught," but because
II have been a prisoner in a penitentiary.
Kver »ince that day. when the new prisoner called him
self a "fish," Walla Walla prison ha* adopted and nurtured
the phrase.
Kvery new convict is a fish. The special cells in which
new prisoners are confined are called "fish cclls." The clothes
worn by a new inmate arc "fish clothes." A convict remain*
a fi*h until he ha< passed medical examination and been ac
cepted as a "regular prisoner."
Reporter Tells How He "Broke Into"
State Penitentiary as a Prisoner
The "fish" is an established feature of the penitentiary.
I "broke into" prison Inst Thursday morning. I remained
in*ide Walla Walla until Sunday night
And during all that time not a single prisoner or prison
official suspected that I was anything but an ordinary fish
who had been punished for one of the many misdeeds which
society considers punishable by imprisonment in steel and
stone.
It is said that I am the fir*t reporter who ever obtained
a real "story" of the "inside" at Walla Walla.
1 have seen life from the inside in such a manner that I
may be able to give the public a new insight into the minds
of the so-called criminal class.
If some of the judges in criminal courts of the state of
Washington could go thru a single day's experience as a
fish. I know that they would put a great deal more thought
into the individual cases of men whom they are called upon
to punish fur the crimes that the law calls felonies.
Punishment of crime is necessary. Penitentiaries are
necessary. Hut imprisonment is a terrible punishment.
The mere deprivation of a man's liberty, regardless of
anv other indiginties which he may suffer in prison, is the
bitterest penalty that any man can pay for his wrongs
Gives Name as "Peter Wilson"; Talks
as Prisoner With Murderers and Burglars
Reformers of men will never succeed so long as judges
continue to give long sentences for comparatively trivial
offense*.
In Walla Walla my name was "Peter Wilson." I was
officially photographed and registered by the Rertillon opera
tor. 1 was given a number, but as the record has since
been scratched from the books, and my number will go to
the next "fish" who enters the prison. 1 have changed the f< ft*
figure of my prison classification to read No. 0047, for H
purpose of these articles. H
In the role of Peter Wilson I talked with murdei H
burglars, *.ife crackers, bank robbers and men of every ci H
tnal distinction. 1 ate with them, worked beside them tH
the jute mill, smoked their tobacco. And those three days
will always stand out as the most interesting period in my
entire life. "
For 111" benefit of the convicts
who may rend this. I wish to say
that th«« confident which they re
posed In me and the prison secrets
which they told me, thinking I was
* fellow prisoner, are wrapped In
my own breast
Nothing which tlie.v said to me
of a nature which might In.jnrc
themselves or any other In
mate will ever l>«> repeated.
