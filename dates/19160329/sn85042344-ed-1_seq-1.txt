WASHINGTON', Mureh 28. Dip
lomatic and domestic aspects
of tlio Mexican problem overshad
owed its military Hide hero tonight.
Official reports from Ocnernl Funston
disclosed no change in tho situation
on the border or in Mexico.
Congress rushed through an emer
gency appropriation of $8,611,002 to
pay for the pursuit of the bandits and
the state department prepared to
press General Carranza for permis
sion to uso Mexican railways to solve
the troop supply problem.
Fears expressed In press reports
from tho border that failure to obtain
. use of the railroads might seriously
hamper tho pursuit of Villa were not
reflected at either the state or war
depart ments.
" Senator Gulllnger, Republican lead
er in the senate, presented to Secre
tary liaker a. telegram from Senator
Fall at Kl Puso dealing with the rail
way and border questions. It declared
shipments of gasoline Intended for
the American forcos in Mexico were
beiiii,' held up by Carranza officials.
"Jcxfciiiis Co-opcriiti1.
"The department s dispatches of
last night and today, while meager
and dealing with technical matters,
indicato continued and growing good
will toward our expedition in Mexico,"
Secretary Uuker said later in a state
ment. "Its object appears to be
thoroughly understood by tho people
of Mexico. We have no dispatcnes
Indicating any cause for apprehen
sion." The communication to General
Carranza will be made, through Spe
cial Representative Kngers at Quere
taio. to whom instructions went for

ficials said it seemed necessary to
Impress upon the de facto govern
ment the need for special considera
tion of the request to use the lines
south from the border without await
ing the perfecting of the protocol un
der negotiation. While there was no
question but that the expedition after
Villa would press on, it was stated,
and thai a sufficient amount of sup
plies could be furnished to the troops
by motor truck trains, general use of
the lines would greatly simplify mat
ters. I'slng Railroads.
-"News dispatches from the border
tonight indicating that the American
troops already were using the rail
road line in some sections, were read
with surpriso at I lie war department,
officials declaring there had been no
official advices to that effect. It was
thought that if the American com
manders had used the lines in some
cases on their own initiative It proo
alily was done in co-operation with
the local Carranza authorities. Offi
cials do not think any extensive use
of railroads has been made.
There are indications that the
check in the protocol negotiations re
sulting from General Carranza's
counter proposals may extend that
discussion a week or more.
General Carranza's suggestions as
.to the details of the protocol appar
ently are causing serious study at the
state department. While officials are
reticent It Is understood the most Im
portant suggestion deals with the ter
ritory to bo embraced within tilt
scope of the agreement. It is thought
possible General Carranza desires to
set narrower limits than 'had been
agreed upon by the Mexican ambassador-designate
and the state de
partment In the original draft. Some
officials think the first chief might

how fur tho American forces have
penetrated or may penetrate Into his
country to carry out their mission.
It was Indicated that General Car
ranza's proposals showed no desire to
exclude the expedition from uso of
tho Mexican railways. On the con
trary tho protocol would establish a
definite agreement for Just that pur
j'ose. " Plenty of Money,
Becretary liaker was emphatic to
day in saying no objection to the uso
of motor truck trains to supply the

officials. With tho $8,000,000 emer

From Headquarters.
SAN ANTONIO, March L'S. Con
flrination that General l'ershliig
already has beu using a portion of
the Northwestern railroad for the
transportation of troops was secured
by General l''unston today from what
was said to be an unofficial source.
This Information included a report of
the overturning of two cars and the
Injuring of ton troopers of the Tenth
cavalry and several horses. Three of
the men were reported seriously In
jured. The uccldent occurred while the
rars were being taken over a shoofly
that had been liullt uround the Cum
bra tunnel south of Casus Gramles.
One of the rails Pave way and tho
cars rolled down an embankment.
It was not believed at headquart
ers that General Pershing's use of the
railroad prior to receipt of permission
from the Carranza government would
endanger the negotiations now being
conducted by tho state department
I'ccuuso it was assumed be hud gained
permission of those In charge of op
eration of that section of the line.
Itotx'ive No Reports.
No repoliH from Ocnernl l'aisliing
were received today but his silence
caused no uneasiness ut houdiiinrtcrs
whero the chief concern coutinuml to
ho the problem ot getting Fiipplics
into Mexico without a railroad.
Advices from Washington that the
state department had prepared n
memorandum urging Carranzu to de
cide tho question of using the rail
road without waiting for tho ratifica
tion of Oie protocol revived tho hope
that perhaps by Thursday the stores
held at 151 l'aso may bo forwarder to
some field depot more accessible to
tho troops now operating almost
three hundred miles from the boun
dary line.
Exactly where Colonel Dodd's env
alry is now or Into how many detach
ments It hns been divided was un
known lit General Kunston's head
quarters today. The exact where
abouts of General l'erslnng also re
niuined unreported, but this lack of
inlormatlon created no uneasiness for
General Pershing still has orders to
work out his own problems. Full
realization of thn danger Into which
somo of the advanced deiai bments
must bo moving was acknowledged.
Villa's known ability as u director of
ambuscades has aroused frank ex
pressions of four among army ol fleers
that ho may catch some of tho Ainer
lcun troops in a mountain trap.
Capture is Far Off.
Openly expressed pessimism ns to
an early capture of Villa now is fre
quently heard. I'nless checked by
the forces of the de facto government,
or unless he himself decides to turn
and fight, there appeared no re-ison
today why the chifse should cease
until Villa had led tho Americans
through twisting mountain trails and
over waterless wastes lor another
three hundred miles and more.
More auto trucks have been asked
for by General Funston und when
they are placed In service there will
be a few more than three hundred
along tho different lines of communi
cation. This Increased number of
auto trucks will not solve tho prob
lem of distributing supplies to the ad
vanced troops, however, slnco a lurge
part of the troops are operating far
away from trails over which tho cars
can be run.
Want More Mncs.
The shifting lines of the chase Villa
Is leading the pursuing Americans
has made more apparent tno desira
bility of getting permission to uso the
Juarez-Chihuahua line of tho National
as well as tho Northwestern railway,
but General Funston has refrained
from making any representations on
the subject, preferring not to Inter
ject a possible embarrassing feature
In tho negotiations already under way
for the other line.
It was pointed out that supplies
routed through Chlhuanua count oe
delivered to the advanced troops now
with less loss of time und that a line
of commonlcatlon established along
that route could be guurded with
fower troops than one along the more
circuitous mountainous route of the
Northwestern.
Troops Move East.
If either railroad la used It is prob
able that all the troops now extend
ing from Columbus through Casas
Grandee to the positions of the ad
vanced cavalry will be moved east
ward along the new route and that
those who then would be necessary to
guard the main line of communica
tion will be moved forward to Join in
the operations against Villa, It Is an

a vehement protest will be made by
Americans residing In the vicinity of
