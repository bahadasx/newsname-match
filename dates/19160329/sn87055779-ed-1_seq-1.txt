LIE
PLEA FOR I
Powerful Violet Rays Said to
Have Affected His
Brain Tissues.
International News Service:
XKW YORK, March 29. That in
sanity will be the defense plea of
Dr. .Arthur Warren Walte, who is
charged with the murder of his mil
llona' re father-in-law, John tZ. Peck,
of Grand Kapids. Mich., was strong
ly indicated today.
Following the admission by Waite
that he killed Mrs. Peck as well as
her husband, being impelled to the
double crime by a "man from
Kgypt." friends of the accused said
that Waite's mind had become dis
torted through the us; of powerful
violet rays.
Dr. Waite bought a S 1.200 ap
paratus for the administering of vio
let rays and installed it in his homo
for treatment. The action of this
powerful electrical agency being
poorly and tinscientilically adminis
tered, had serious effect upon the
brain tissues.
Friends of the accused man said
that Waite had decided upon violet
rays treatment to overcome obesity
and to build up his nervous system.
Waite's plot to secure the Peck
fortune, his friends say, was first
conceived when his mind became
unbalanced through the use of the
violet rays.
The strange mental conceptions of
Waite set forth in his latest confes-
j si0n wln probably furnish the
