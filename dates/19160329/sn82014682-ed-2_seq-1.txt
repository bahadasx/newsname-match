" What Kauai think. ' , V
What Kauai people think - of the

The" Garden Island declares .emphati

needless and has. hurt homesteading.
The editorial 'says: -: -' '"'' '
"The governor Is coming to Kauai

It has been subjected; and the 'gov

find his (or their) hands full In any
effort that may now be made toward
a settlement satisfactory to all in
terests Involved. As we understand
the facts, the Llhue Plantation Com
pany, which advanced the original
proposition . to supply railroad facili

the region In question, has been prac

affected favorably by such proposals
as the governor may have to put for

"Public Interest to this whole mat

This threat of eventual free sugar,
declare a number of those interested
in sugar, on' well as several brokers
who keep their ears close to the

When the judiciary plum-tree was

all of the fruit seemed to fall with a
slant iri the direction of Hawaii. Six
big ones rolled that way, two of them,
however, not helng entirely of this
year's rrop. These two wero the re
appointments of , Chief .Justice Robert

of whom had rccclrcd recess reap;

home of former Secretary of Agricul
ture James Wilson, was, the only nom
inee ot the unusual batch sent In by
the president who Is unknown to Ha
waii folk.j He is described only as a
good lawyer and active in local poli
tics. Just why a United States attor
ney was selected from a rockribbed
Republican state like Iowa . has
not been explained. The only sugges
tion advanced - s that the Democrats
may be planning to reform that com
monwealth. In any event Mr. Huber had the Job
nailed down many weeks ago. When
he came here for a consultation with
the attorney general on the subject
there was no longer any doubt as to
the future occupant of Jeff McCarn's
shoes. He went back home with the
position In his vest pockef
. During his visit here James L. Coke,
who was supposed to be in the run
ning for the" district attorneyship,
made a regiment of good friends. All
of these now express regret that he
lost out ;
The appointment of Judges Vaugh
ari and Thompson occasioned no sur
prise. Both had been ; prominently
mentioned for the places assigned. In
fact no other ncme ever was serious
ly considered for the third circuit
judgesalp but tbat of Mr. Thompson.
When Mr. Vaughan was sent to the
islands it was generally understood
that he was placed "in training" for
the bench.
The recent, distribution of federal
pie. leaves but little coming to Ha
waii. There appears to be an opening
for an assistant United States attor
ney. The plugging-up of that opening
would about, clear the slate.
If- Postmaster Young carries out what
is understood here to be his intention
and resigns along in April there will
be another good berth for a "deserv
ing Democrat" The creating of a va
cancy depends entirely on Mr. Young.
His service has been exceptionally sat
isfactory to the officials here and he
will oe persuaded to remain, if possible.
