ODOM DEFENDS
INSURANCE Li
CHESTERFIELD MAN SAYS COMOAxirc-c
APP TRYING TO
FRIGHTEN THE PEOPLE.
Chesterfield, March 20.?W. P.
Odom, representative from Chesterfield
county, and co-author with Senator
Laney of the anti-compact bill,
is proud of his work in connection
with the insurance legislation. Mr.
Odom succeeded in transferring the
bill irom another legislative committee
to the committee on agriculture,
of which he is chairman. "I am
proud of my work in this matter and
indeed grateful to the members of
the house who stood so firmly by the
bill. It is one of the biggest things
which could have been done," he
said. Discussing the bill, he said:
"The insurance companies are trying
to_frighten the people throughout
the" State on account of the
passage of the anti-compact law.
A great many of them have withf*"\n1
thfl fi+oto / laiminc thnt.
it is imposible to do business under
the terms of the aqt. It will be noticed,
however,- that they are not
complaining about the feature of the
bill that forbids a combination of insurance
companies to name rates,
but they are very violently opposed
to that feature that gives the insurance
commissioner the authority to
review rates as to whether they are
discriminatory or unjust, and also
they claimed to be opposed to the
malting of an path that they have
not during the previous year violated
the terms of the act.
What of Charles Bill?
"It would take a very credulous
person indeed to believe that these
constitute the real objections to the
act. If these are the real objections,
why did not the insurance compan*
ies fight the Charles bill, which
passed the house without discussion.
This Charles bill provided for the
same review of rates by the insurance
commissioner as does the anti
compact law. Why is it that this
feature was unopposed in the one
bill and now so objectionable in the
other? Explanations are in order.
Of course, it would not be good policy
to come out in their true colors
and state their real objection to the
law, to wit, the forbidding of a
combination of companies to make
rates on fire risks.
"No thinking man who has kept
up with the insurance news since
the passage of the anti-compact law
could swallow without a pinch of
salt the statement that the insurance
companies are not acting in
concert in withdrawing from the
State. This must have been arranged
at that New York conference of
insurance companies which took
place at the time Gov. Manning was
bearing the opponents of the bill.
"This is a contest between the
people of the State of South Carolina
and the big insurance companies,
and it is up to the people to stand
to it or forever hereafter crawl like
snakes. I fully believe the statement
of Mr. Seibles when he says
the insurance companies are not
withdrawing through revenge. I do
believe, however, the withdrawals
J* _ I _1i1 a.
are in pursuance 01 a aeiiueruie uesign
concocted in New York to coerce
and intimidate the people of
the State. They hope to create a
state of demoralization so that there
will be such a demand for the repudiation
of the anti-compact law
that the next legislature will repeal
it. Should this happen. Lord have
mercy upon us. In this case the
Southeastern Underwriters' association
would secure a much stronger
strangle hold upon us, and their arrogance
in the past would be as
nothing to what we would have to
endure in the future. Shall we sit
idly around and allow these foreign
insurance companies to dictate to a
sovereign people? God forbid.
State Must Be Unafraid.
"It is the duty of the people of
this State to elect men to the next
legislature who can not be frightened
by threats and who can not be
influenced by fear, favor or gain.
This battle must be won regardless
of the cost. We must not bend the
hinges of the knee that thrift may
follow fawning, but we must stand
together and defeat the designs of
this insurance monopoly. As long
as I am a member of the legislature
3 will vote against the repeal of the
anti-compact law should every company
in South Carolina withdraw to
the north side of the north pole. I
do not fear that we shall be without
insurance, although I fully believe
all the large foreign companies will
withdraw. We will just sit steady
in the boat and paddle in the middle
of the stream while the different
chambers of commerce and insur
Iance agents associations are meeting
in Columbia to concoct plants to deliver
the State over to the big insurance
companies. Wherever and
whenever there is business that can
"be done at a profit, some one will do
the business.
"During the argument on the floor
of the house the opponents of the
bill argued very strenuously the
* absolute necessity of having a common
rating bureau, and if each company
were forced to maintain a separate
organization the expenses
"would necessarily be increased,
would be reflected in the rate. Now,

PRESIDENT WILSON
mill
I TO PEOPLE OF UNITED STATES
AGAINST MACHINATIONS OF
UNSCRUPULOUS COTERIE
Washington, March 25.?President
Wilson tonight issued warning that
"sinister and unscrupulous influences'
are spreading alarmist reports about
the Mexican situation with the object i
of forcing intervention by the United \
States '"in the interest of certain I
American owners of Mexican properties."
In a formal statement the president
told the people to be on their guard j
and not to creidt such stories. He!
called attention again to the govern-1
ment's announcement that the sole !
object of the punitive expedition was
to punish Villa and his followers.
The news services had been asked,
the persident said, to assist in keeping
this view constantly before the'
Mexican and American people. The !
warning was issued after careful!
consideration of many official reports
from throughout the United States '
anH Mexico savine that alarmists' j
stories of the intentions of^the Wash-!
ington government were having an!
undesirable effect upon the Mexican1
people and the American residents.
in Mexico.
The possibility that Gen. Carranza's
hand might be weakened to a perilous
extent should the Mexican public misunderstand
the American expedition
has been a prevailing factor in the
entire operations against Villa. .
Drastic steps may be taken if the
warning is not heeded. I
The president's statement follows:
Only One Purpos*. i
"As has already been announced,!
the expedition into Mexico was ordered
under an agreement with the
de facto government of Mexico for
the single purpose of taking the bandit
Villa, whose forces had actually
invaded the territory of the United
States, and is in no sense intended as
an invasion of that republic or as an
infringement of its sovereignty. I
have therefore asked the several news
services to be good enough to assist
the administration in keeping this
view of the expedition constantly before
both the people of this country
and the distressed and sensitive people
of Mexico, who are very susceotible
indeed to impressions received
from the American press not only but
also very ready to believe that those
impressions proceed from the views
and objects of our government itself.
Such conclusions, it must be said, are
not unnatural because the main if
not the only source of information
for the people on both sides of the
border is the public press of the United
States.
"In order to avoid the creation of
erroneous and dangerous impressions
in this way, I have called upon the
several news agencies to use the utmost
care not to give news stories regarding
this expedition the color of (
war, to withhold stories of troop 1
movements and military preparations
which might be given that interpre-'
tatioiyand to refrain from publishing
unverified rumors of unrest in Mexico.
Should Show Clean Hands.
"I feel that it; is most desirable to
impress upon both our own people
and the people of Mexico the fact
that the expedition is simply a neces
sary puniuve measure, aiineu suieiy
at the elimination of the marauders
who raided Columbus and who infest
an unprotected district near the border
wnich they use as a base in making
attacks upon the lives and property
of our citizens within our own
territory. It is the purpose of our
commanders to cooperate in every
possible way with the force of Gen.1
Garranza in removing this cause of
irritation to both governments and
to retire from Mexican territory as
soon as that object is accomplished, i
"It is my duty to warn the people
ox me uiuteu otitLCb tiiat uicic aic
persons all along the border who are
actively engaged in originating and
giving as wide currency as they can
to rumors of the most sensational and
disturbing sort which are wholly unjustified
by the facts. - The object of
this traffic in falsehood is obvious.
It is to create intolerable friction between
the government of the United
States and the de facto government
, of Mexico for the purpose of bringing
about intervention in the interest of
certain American owners of Mexican
properties. This object can not be
attained so long as sane and honorable
men are in conrtol of this government,
but very serious conditions
may be created, unnecessary bloodshed
may result and the relations between
the two republics may be very
much embarrassed.

VILLA ELODES
PURSUING ARMIES
FOUGHT HIS WAY THROUGH
CARRANZA'S LINES, SEEKS
HIS OLD-TIME HAUNTS.
San Antonio, March 26.?Francisco
Villa has escaped from the Mexican
troops which checked him near
Namiquipa, and three columns of
American cavalry are pursuing him.
Already they are almost 250 miles
south of the border and unless the
elusive bandit is brought to another
stand this distance will be greatly
increased by the close of the week.
Villa's success in extricating himself
from the dangerous position into
which he had been driven by the
American punitive force was related
in a detailed report of Gen. Pershing
that reached Gen Funston to-day.
Gen. Funston forwarded the report
to Washington without making public
any but the essential features.
Col. Dodd is commanding the advance
columns that are riding hard
after Villa and his men, and Gen.
Pershing has divided his forces so as
to provide supporting columns along
the thinly stretched lines of communication
from his most advanced
base at El Valle. From El Valle another
line is being maintained back
to Casas Grandes from where communication
with the border is maintained.
Gen Pershing himself is somewhere
south of Casas Grandes directing
the work of holding together his
forces and directing, so far as possible.
the rmerflt.inns nf P.ol DorM f!nu.
airy is being used along the lines of
communication with El Valle, where
a detachment of infantry is stationed.
Work for Aeronaut*.
Three aeroplanes are at El Valle
and will be used in scouting as soon
as the high winds that have been
sweeping that part of Mexico for almost
a week subside and which, according
to Gen. Pershing, have made
effective assistance by them impossible.
Of the eight machines that went
into Mexico, two still are out of commission.
They were damaged in the
flights from Columbus to Casas
Grandes.
Details of the operations about
Namiquipa, which concluded with the
escape of Villa, were not revealed,
but there is little reason to believe
he was badly whipped or even weakened
by the fighting directed against
him by the de facto Government
troops.
Reports last week from Mexican
sources indicate that he had been severely
defeated by the loyal forces
of Carranza and a few reports state
that American troops had participated
in the action. It now appears that
no Americans'were actually engaged
and the fact that Villa made his way
through what was described as an
encircling line of Mexican troops,
was taken here to indicate that he
was the victor.
Headed for Mountains.
Villa now appears to be heading for
the mountains of the Guerrero district.
Once there, it is conceded, his
capture will be difficult and should
he choose to pass through the district
on into the south, there are trails
over which he might move his little
army until a junction is made with
one or more of his roving organizations
in Southern Chihuahua, or
Northern Durango.
If Villa moves into the districts
further south, military men realize
that the problem of capturing him
will become many times more complex.
More troops will become necessary
and their provisioning by way
of country roads will become practically
an impossibility.
Fifty-four more auto trucks were
put into service to-day along the line
L^i. - ? n.i 1 XT T\f J
uetween i/uiumuus, i?i., anu uasoa
Grandes, and twenty-seven more
were reported to be on their way
from the factory, but even with this
increase in the motive power of the
transportation division, bad weather
and heavy roads make that method
of getting supplies to the front uncertain,
in the opinion of officers
connected with the quartermaster's
department. The escape of Villa and
his renewed movement toward the
south, they say, make the use of at
least one of the railroads, and possibly
both, from Juarez to Chihuahua
almost essential to the success of the
chase.
THREE AMERICANS KILLED.
Douglas, Ariz., March 24.?Three
Americans, two women and one man,
were killed near Gibson's line ranch
on the New Mexico-Mexico boundary,
eight miles west of Columbus, N. M.,
between 4 and 5 o'clock Wednesday
afternoon, presumably by Mexicans,
according to the story brought here
by a party of five Douglas people,
who said they arrived on the scene
shortly after the bodies had been removed
by soldiers.
A command of United States soldiers
stationed at the Gibson ranch
was said to have crossed the line
in pursuit of the slayers.
Samuel Collins, automobile dealer;
Mr. and Mrs. Russell T. Childers,
Miss Lottie Milinowski and Edward
Freeman, all of Douglas, were the
automobilists who told of the alleged
killing.
Col. I. H. Hunt, of Newberry, was
here Wednesday on professional
business and seeing his many friends.

thousands of bales of cotton were ii
stored, and leaped into the residential
section last night, hardly had o

J fight early today before a citizens' 1;
committee met and^raised a $7,425 E

was announced that $50,000 would ti
I be raised. Mayor J. B. Littleton de- t!
clared a moratorium today to aid fire s;
sufferers, and it may extend through
several days. v
Estimates of the fire loss remained tl
at $5,000,000 tonight, but citizens d
who discussed the disaster expressed s:
the view that the loss of 130 business
houses was not felt more than was e
the destruction of many historic tl
buildings. St Paul's Episcopal u
church, erected 135 years ago, fell tl
before the flames. Dozens of homes to
of colonial style that had withstood a
the ravages of the war between the si
states were consumed. a
Work was begun today to restore a
conditions to normal. Telephone and q
lighting service was badly damaged,
and this was being restored tonight.
It was announced that convict gangs
would be brought in from the roads
of Richmond county tomorrow to
clean up the city streets. .
Thousands of visitors from nearby ?
Georgia towns and from South Caro- "
lina points just across the Savannah
river, came to Augusta today, some
as idle onlookers and many as active ?
helpers. Police and three companies P
of local militia did guard duty.
No lives were lost. A dozen persons
were slightly hurt. Four fire- D
men remained in hospitals tonight
but none was seriously injured. e
Both newspapers here, the Chronicle,
established in 1785, and the Heraid,
lost their plants. The Chroni- T
cle, driven from its new ten story
building, published a miniature edition
this morning in a local job plant. 3
The Herald published a small sized
issue and arranged to get out its usu- S1
al editions tomorrow at Thomason, 8]

how as many as 102 persons missing,

The Sussex had 436 persons aboard,

NEW STATE BONDS
ARE NOW SIGNED
MANNING SIGNED 4,800 REFUNDING
BONDS?WILL NOW TAKE
UP REMAINING ACTS.
Columbia, March 26.?(Special.)
?Governor Manning has completed
the task of signing the 4,800 new
State refunding bonds. This has
taken the larger part of the govern*
or's time for the past several days
and he has kept constantly at it. Beginning
Monday the governor'plans
to take up the acts of the general assembly
remaining in his office and
dispose of them. This will consume,
the first few days of next week and '
the governor will then turn to the
many duties connected with the office.
The new State bonds will place approximately
$1,500,000 on the tax
books as investments by banks of
their capital and surplus in these
bonds are not exempt from taxation
as was the case with the brown
consol bonds. The new bonds also
bear 4 per cent interest instead of
the 4 1-2 per cent carried by the old
bonds and this will affect a further
saving of $25,000 yearly to the taxpayers
of the State in interest.
New Industrie*.
The secretary of State this morning
issued a commission to the Harvey
Corporation of Charleston with a
capital of $5,000 the petitioners being
J. N. Nathans and- Wilson G.
Barvey. The company will do a general
real estate business.
A certificate of dissolution of charter
was filed by the Black River Mercantile
company of Georgetown.
State Birth Rat*.
South Carolina in 1915 had a birth
rate of 28 against a death rate of
15.2 according to figures made public
this morning by the bureau of vital
statistics. The total births were
44,950, of which 21,142 were white
and 23,622 colored. The whites
had a birth rate of 29.1 against 26.7
for the colored. The total deaths
during the year were 24,501 of which
9,141 were whites and 15,350 colored,
a death rate 12.2 for whites
against 17.4 for negroes.
There were 2,874 still births in the
State during the year.
MAY ABOLISH CHARGING
OF EXCHANGE ON CHECKS
_
Washington, March 24.?Governors
of the 12 federal reserve banks
will meet here April 12, it was announced
today to discuss with the reserve
board a proposal to adopt a
standard clearing house system which
could be put into effect throughout
the United States. Out of the conference
it is believed there will develop
a system under which cheeks
may be cashed at par in any section
of the United States.
Another innovation proposed is abolition,
so far as members of the reserve
system are concerned, of the
time -honored custom > of country
banks of making collection charges*
irarying from 10 cents to a ?1 generally,
for cashing checks on out of
town banks. The custom has existed
for more than a hundred years and
inasmuch as a considerable portion of
the country banks' revenue is derived
from these charges, attempts to
abolish it have been stoutly opposed
in the past
