Washington, March 29. Consul Frost at Queenstown
cabled the state department today that the British steamship
Eagle Point with one or more Americans on board, had been
torpedoed by a submarine.
Washington, March 29 Gener
Carranza has agreed to permit the
movement of supplies to the punitive
expedition In Mexico over the Mexi
can Northwestern railroad. The sup
plies will go as commercial freight to
concerns In Mexico with which the
h army has contracts.
The permission for use of the rail
road Is not granted In a military sense
and does not cover the movement of
troops for which the Amen'can army
has not asked. It will, however, en
able General Pershing's force to get
supplies In abundance In a country
where motor truck trains cannot carry
them and will thus aid Immeasurably
In the pursuit of the Villa bandits.
Funston Well Prepared.
San Antonio, Texas, March 29.
General Funston and his staff had
been so confident that Carranza
would give unequalified consent to
the use of Mexican railways for send
, Ing supplies to the American expedi
tion, If he gave a favorable decision
at all, that all arrangements were
"made for the use of the American
crews in the operation of trains and
tentative arrangements had been com
pleted for the Immediate use of roll
ing stock of ther railroads.

Impose no condition but even with
1 the stipulation that the supplies must

at army headquarters.
3 The line of motor trucks In opera

along the line of communication until
A the new arrangement Is well under

Should there be 'no hitch In arrange

. that Columbus will soon be aban-
doned as a base.
1 Supplies to Go Forward.
j El Paso, Texas, March 29. Supplies
j will begin to go forward on the Mexl-
: co Northwestern railroad within a few
hours after General Bell has received
official notification of the consent of
' General Carranza to the use of the
3 road. General Bell said everything
" Was In readiness and he was prepared

i from General Funston. He expressed
if the greatest gratification and relief
I over the news that General Carranza
had granted the request of the Ameri
can government.
For over a week the quartermaster's
department here has been working
day and night preparing for the possi
bility that Carranza -would consent
to the use of the railroad. A big sup
Ply depot has been established down
town within a fow blocks of the In
ternational railroad bridge. In addi
tion, train crews have been enlisted
from among the engineers, firemen
, and conductors who wore formerly
employed on the Mexican roads.
Train EauiDment Thoroughly
J Arranged.
The question of train equipment has
y also been thoroughly arranged. Every
,v engine and car which the American
v i roadB passing through here could sup-
j Ply in an emergency has been listed
ci and can go into service when called
' I for.
' According to the plans of the mill-
4 tary authorities, the supplies will be
ent to Casas Grandea on trains
' manned exclusively by Americans and
I Probably driven by American en-
t 4, tfnes. The roadbed of the Mexico
; Northwestern is said to be In excel-1
I i5.ttt cndltion except at spots where
z the bridges have been burned by
; bands of VllHstao. TheBe bridges
J Jave been repaired and all trains
t have to make their way across the
Roches on temporary rails.
I General Gaylra, the Carranza com'
X Zander at Juarez, when informed un-
officially that permission to use tho
road had been granted, said he would
. make no comment until he heard from
Queretaro but that he held himself
JU readiness to obey any orders of

Pos'tion of Troops Not Revealed.
General Pershing was known to" be
with one of the advance columns to
day, but at his own request the posi

All detachments operating south and
east of Namiquipa were reported to
be pushing forward at high speed and

As to the details of the actual chase
of Villa, however, General Funston

It was expected that Special Reprc-.

of the request for the use. of the rail

protocol now under negotiation.
While It was admitted at tho war
department that the use of the rail
ways would simplify the troop, supply
problem, it was said that the $8,000.

available, will enable tho department
to establish a complete independent
motor truck supply system regardless
of the railroads. Two more motor
truck companies have been requested
by General Funston and will be for

companies General Funston will have
216 trucks with which to maintain

Monterey, Mexico, March 29.
Troops are being sent from here by
the Carranza authorities to quell the
roving bands of brigands infesting
the region about Torreon. Everything
is quiet here.
Grim Chase Continues.
Elx Paso, Texas, March 29. The
chase of the brigand Villa by the fly
ing columns of American cavalry goes
relentlessly on but from the meager
ness of the official dispatches from
General Pershing's advanced base it
was impossible to learn to day the
position of the American troops and
how far they were in the rear of the
fleeing band. Villa was last heard of
heading southward toward the Tara
hamare mountain country, his com
mand, driving their Mexican ponies
at full speed and being closely press
ed by the American troops.
Carranza troops now in the Chi
huahua region apparently have lost
trace of Villa and his men for no re
port has been received by Mexican
officials here for some time concern
ing Villa's whereabouts.
Armed Bands Reported.
Armed bands ofVillistas are reported
In various parts of Chihuahua and So
nora and in some numbers around Tor
reon, but they are operating Inde
pendently of the main Villa band. Of
ficials iri Juarez express their belief
that Villa will tryto establish a main
base at some point after he has
thrown the American cavalry off his
trail and then recruit his command to
one of large proportions, many Villls
las are now roving about the southern
Sonora district
Maraudlrg Campaign Expected.
The Carranza officials think Villa
will then engage In a marauding cam
paign that will give the Carranza and
American officials no end of trouble.
Officials here do not believe that
Villa will ever make a stand and fight
but will continue In flight until he
escapes or is cornered
Somewhere amid the grim and for
bidding extinct volcanoes of the great
continental -divide, Pancho Villa Is
fleeing southward today Hard on his
trail, the cavalrymen of the United
States army are straining every nerve
I to catch up with him before ho can
reach the wastes, almost unknown to
any but Mexicans and Indians, In
which he began his career as a bandit
years ago
In the absence of any official news
of the chase, the border has settled
down to speculation, based on such
slim information as Is brought back to
the United States by American mining
men and ranchers who straggle in
here by ones and twoB.
Long Chase Forecast.
The little optimism that is express
ed here regarding a speedy termina
tion of the task before General Per
Bhlng's columns, is based on the fact
that Villa Is contending for the first
time against American soldiers, equip
ped with every device that science
has contributed to modern warfare.
Americans familiar with Mexico are
unanimous In their opinion that the
troopers of the north, operating In an
unfamiliar country and riding the
corn fed horses of the plains, are tre
mendously handicapped against the
Mexican bandits on their mountain
bred ponieB. It is not a question of
nerve or courage. It Is a problem of
climatic, topographic and other natur
al conditions against which the stout
est heart and strongest muscle are
helnless.
Rancher Knows Villa.
An American ranchor who Is one
of the few foreigners who is familiar
with the country through which Villa
is retreating expressed the following
view of the situation today:
"I have known Francisco Villa for
twenty years," he said. "For many
years T was the only white man In
the country in which he llvetf. I know
his habits, his processes of mind and
the Tarahumare Indians aralng Avhom
he Ib at present. I have very little
hope that the American cavalry can
ever catch him now that he has, pre
sumably, fifty or more miles start of
them. Villa and his men, mounted on
their Mexican ponies cap travel forty
miles a day with ease and fifty miles
if pressed.
"All his men need is a little dried
beef and some corn meal. With this
and a blanket strapped bohind their
saddles they can travel indefinitely.
Indians Will Not Aid Americans.
"Tho Tarahumare Indians will not
give tho slightest assistance to the
Americans but they will dig up their
last grain of corn or wheat for Villa.
More than that, they will give him
speedier Information about his pur
suers than tho fastest horseman could
give. There is no horse that could
keep paco with these Indians in that
country. I have often sent one of
them from my ranch to Minaca, a dis
tance of eighty two miles. He could
start In the evening and reach Min
aca the next morning. It is almoat
Impossible to tiro them and all they
need for subsistence Is a little ball of
dried meat that they carry with them.
"Another difficulty Is that there is
practically no water In that country
now and what little there Ib, will be
dried up Boon. Thero may be a few

There are no dead among the pas
sengers on the Twentieth Century
limited, though a number of passen
gers v were- badly hurt on this train
Two coaches of the Twentieth Cen
tury were overturned. The low casu
alties on the Twentieth Century are
attributed to the fact that the palace
train was proceeding slowly because
of the heavy fog. '
Second Running at High Speed.
The second section of the flier was
going at a high rate of speed when It
struck the first section.
Many of the dead probably will go
to their graves unidentified.
Most of those were asleep in the
rear coach of the first section of No.
86 at the time of the crash.
Bodies Horribly Mangled.
The bodies of many of these scant
ily clad are so horribly mangled that
identification without the guidance of
their clothing will be Impossible.
Some of the victims were decapaci
tated. Arms, legs and portions of
human bodies were scattered thickly
through the wreckage.
Relief parties collected the remains
of three bodies those of a woman
and two men and piled them, indis
criminately, in one basket
Tho body of one fireman badly
crushed was found on top of the boiler
of one of tho englneB.
Somo of tho members of the crews
of the three trains Involved in the
wreck escaped with scratches and
bruises.
(J. U. Robinson, Toledo, engineer of
tho Twentieth Century, crawled unin
jured from under his engine after it
had plunged four hundred feet along
the ties. His fireman, Walter Mann,
Toledo, and the conductor, M. V.
Burke, Buffalo, also were unhurt.

Sees Horrible Sights.
A. Coraenisky, Pittsburg, coming
from Chicago, said he saw a woman
die in the wreckage before he could
extricate her. He also saw a man
whose arms were torn from their
sockets. When the last three named
leit, only tnirteen or tno ioriy occu
pants of tho day coach were account
ed for. They placed the number of
dead at between 25 and 30.
According to Fritzele and De Ray,
the first section stopped five minutes
after it left Amherst and was just
picking up speed again when the first
crash came. Two minutes later, they
said, the second occurred.
General Manager's Story.
D. C. Moon, genora4 manager of the
New York Central lines at Cleveland,
gives this story on the wreck as it
was given him from his subordinates
at 9 o'clock:
"The engineer of the first section
of train No. 86 was stopped at Am
herst by a signal I don't know just
how. The second section should have
stopped because of the automatic sig
nal or by the signal of a flagman on
the first section.
"Tn second section ran Into the
end coach of the first section. The
wreckage from both sections went
over on the westbound high speed
track. It had forty passengers. The
next car ahead of the coach was a
club Pullman car. The cars ahead
of the coach and club car were sleep
ers. No body in them was hurt"
Tower Man Blamed.
A slip on the part of a dozing tow
er man was to blame 'for the wreck,
according to A. S, Ingall8, general
superintendent of the Now York Cen
tral. Ingalls with L. A, Robinson,
general passenger agent of the New
York Central, and Daniel McBan, sup
orlntendont of motlvo power of the
road, conducted an inquiry into the
tragedy on tho part of tho road offi
cials. The towerman's wife had been
111, it was learned, and he had been
without sleep, or on duty practically
since Sunday night.
