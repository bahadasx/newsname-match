JOUlt.YU.ISM WEEK FOR ILLINOIS
Uniu'rit) of Miouri Idea Taken Up
by Neighboriuir State.
The Journalism Week idea, which
originated with the School of Journal
ism of tile University of Missouri, has
been adopted by the University of Illi
nois. April C, V and S have been select
ed as the date for the "first annual
conference of editors and business
managers of Illinois newspapers."
As at the University of Missouri, the
program for the first Illinois confer
ence will consist of addresses by lead
ing newspaper men. James Kecley,
editor of the Chicago Herald, and
James Scherniprhorn of the Detroit
Times are included among the speakers.
SIX LAW STUDENTS MARRIED
Higher Education o Itar to Matri
mony in Tin' School.
The popular belief that higher edu
cation postpones the age of marriage
and threatens the perpetuation of the
race is not supported by a census of
the University of Missouri School of
Law, which reveals thg fact that about
C per cent of the students are married
and that of these two-thirds have
children.
Those, enviousl- pointed out by the
other ttudents as the benedicts, im
press the stranger as being compli
ments to the good taste of their wives;
they seem to be among the best kept.
According to Dean Eldon R. Janier
their work is on a par with that of the
other students. They might be ex
pected to know more about domestic
relations and the rights of women.
The proveriably lean years of the
law have no trrors for Missouri law-
students in the light of these examples.
who find it possible to support families
before completing their courses and
being admitted to the bar.
Maidens, don't waste your leap year
favors on these men: J. C. McDowell,
John S. Jones, Rush H. Limbaugh,
William F. Strangways, Willie M.
Stringer and B. M. Fish.
Grant School Ulan For Arbor Day.
Plans are being made for an Arbor
Day celebration at the Grant School.
Trees will be planted and the school-
grounds beautified. The playground ap
paratus will probably be installed at
that time. The Mothers' Club meet

week, will be held at " o'clock to
morrow afternoon at the school.
BY HEKSCHEI. M. COLBERT.
CHICAGO, March 29. .Miss Mabel
Sturtevant, formerly of Brookfield,
.Mo., and a graduate of the University
of Missouri in 1S0S, yesterday faced
some of Chicago's most prominent so
ciety women, who appeared before
Judge J. Otis Humphrey, in the Unit
ed States District Court here as wit
nesses against her in the trial in which
the Government accuses her of using
the mails to defraud.
A federal indictment was returned
against Miss Sturtevant three years
ago, in which she is alleged to have so
licited money from many wealthy per
sons for the supposed purpose of rais
ing funds to aid poor and needy girls
through college. The organization
through which she worked was the As
"relation of College Women Workers,
and .Miss Sturtevant was its president.
U. S. Attorney Makes Charge.
In the opening statement of Assist
ant United States District Attorney
James R. Glass to the jury, he said
he would show that Miss Sturtevant's
organization was nothing more than
an agency for the sale of cook books,
and that she as its president used the
money collected for her own use and
did not even pay the girls she had
working for her in her office.
The reply of her attorney was that
Miss Sturtevant never diverted a dol
lar of the funds collected and that he
would show she was acting for others
who employed her to conduct the work
of the association.
Miss Sturtevant was a student in the
X niversity from lPO.'i until 190S. She
worked her way through the Univer
sity, was a student of exceptional
ability and went to Europe on a schol
arship, according to the statement of
her attorney. After her return to this
country she entered magazine work,
leaving it to join the Association of
College Women Workers. At present
she is a nurse, and broke quarantine
in a diphtheria case at Flagg Center,
111., to come to Chicago for the trial.
Women Tell of Giving Money.
Mrs. John D. Murphy, wife of the
surgeon, Mrs. William Mcllvaine. Mrs.
John R. Montgomery and Mrs. Em
mons Bainc were the members of Chi
cago society who took the stand yes
terday against the defendant. They
testified to being solicited for various
amounts by telephone call, letter and
personal visit, for the aid of different
girls. Mrs. Baine said she gave $210
to the cause, while the others gave
?23 and $50. In each case a note was
given by Miss Sturtevant to covar the
amount, but the notes never were paid.
they testified.
Cross-examination by her attorney
brought out the fact that none of the
witnesses knew whether the girls re
ceived the money. Carrie Worrell, a
student who Miss Sturteant said was
being helped through Wheaton College,
told Mrs. Montgomery, the latter testi
fied, that she has not been given any
money by Miss Sturtevant, but no other
proof could be given.
Mrs. John Cudahy and Mrs. II. C.
Chatfield-Taylor are among the others
who say they gave money to Miss
Sturtevant and who were expect?d to
take the witness stand when the case
was resumed today. The trial is not
expected to end for a day or two.
"Free From Preservative"
Says C. H. Eckles Streets
to Be Cleaned Soon.
A Democratic Candidate
Street cleaning, Columbia's milk
supply and laundries were discussed
at the meeting 0f the Women's Civic
League at the Y. M. C. A. Building yes
terday, Mrs. .Mary P. Thomson, as
leader of the street cleaning discus
sion, suggested that the Boy Scouts
of Columbia be asked to assist with
the street cleaning. She urged that
since the Parent-Teachers' Associa
tion would send 200 delegates here in
April, the cleaning be done before that
time.
Prof. C. II. Eckles said that in gen
eral Columbia's milk supply was good.
"I have tested milk here twelve
years," declared Professor Eckles,
"and I have never found a preserva
tive in It."
He warned the patrons that they
should insist upon having sterilized
bottles. He said the bottles were not
always sterilized in the small dairies.
Takes up Laundry Question.
Mrs. L. U Bernard talked about
laundry. She pointed out the relation
between health and laundry, and said
that no clothes should be sent to a
private home to be washed unless the
sanitary conditions there were known
to be good. Since this is almost im
possible, Mrs. Bernard suggested two
other plans. The first was that clothes
be sent to a pricate laundry, of the
kind Columbia has. She pointed out
that even here one should know that
the employes of the laundry were in
good health. Mrs. Bernard told about
one laundry in town that would will
ingly submit its employes to a medical
examination if the women of Columbia
o desired. Mrs. Bernard's second
plan was to establish a co-operative
laundry in Columbia. These laundries.
which are popular in some rural dis
tricts, are owned by stock companies.
They are usually established In con
nection with creameries, so that the
motor power that runs the creamery
may be used to run the laundry. Mrs.
Bernard told of some of these co
operative laundries that have paid 10
per cent dividends.
'Present System Probably Host."
Mrs. Bernard concluded that since
Columbia had several private laun
dries, Columbia women should join
with these to secure efficient service
rather than attempt to establish a co
operative laundry.
Mrs. J. E. Wrnech, who had charge
of the program, told about the insani
tary condition of a house on Seventh
street It was suggested that the own
er of the house be first requested to
repair the building. The health ordi
nances, which the women of the league
have been working for, will not be
presented to the City Council until the
new councilmen are elected.

Pennant Wnies Today From Dome of
Academic Hall.
Students on their way to S o'clock
classes this morning craned their
necks to see a huge green flag wav
ing from the top-most point of the
dome of Academic Hall. All day the
mystery of the emerald-hued pennant
has been the topic or discussion on
the ground. Who put up the Hag?
There is apparently small doubt re
garding what the flag represents and
the department whose students are re
sponsible for the Teat. Engineers smile
and shake their heads when question
ed. Mechanicians at the heat and light
plant, whose duty it will be to re
move the pennant, are plainly worried,
for the pole appears to be fast
ened to one of the projecting wings
on the dome by strong iron bolts.
So far no official order has been
issued for the removal of the emblem,
but it is expected tomorrow. It is be
lieved that a ladder, block and tackle
were used in putting up the flag and
that several men were required for the
task.
NOW FIREMEN ATTEND DANCES
That IIra.I(u(toned ."Han at Columbia
Hall I for Your Safety.
The man in a brass-buttoned uni

man stationed there to look to the
safety of the hall and its occupants.
A. O. Long, manager of the Dorn-
Cloney laundry Company, which owns
the Columbia Hail, recently made an
agreement with Fire Chief Kurtz to
station a fireman at the hall when
dances are given.
Chief Kurtz said that lie suggested
the plan to Mr. Long, who readily ac
cepted it. The inflammable materials
used for decorating purpo: 's by or
ganizations make sucli steps for fire
prevention necessary.
