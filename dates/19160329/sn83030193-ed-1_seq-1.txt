ing He Won't Provide for
Daughter by First Wife.
It takes Ili.OOii ft year to rear a
.girl fioni .nf.mey to womanhood and
' lit her for the proror station In life.
This figure was set to-day by Mrs.
Mary A. Doyle in a suit brought In
the Supreme Court against her broth
er. Kdwln Fitzgerald, known better
a.s 1-Mille poy. the comedian.
Por several yeais Poy and Ids elev
en ehildreii have luen making .i tour
of the blir vaudeville clt cults. Mrs.
Doyle, in her huit, says there Is a
i twelfth Poy, Catherine Stanley Fitz
gerald, now twenty. w honi Mrs. Doyle,
has been caring for slnco the death
of the llrst Mrs. Fitzgerald in 1S90.
Poy mltr.lt that Catherine was his
daughter but a; the age of nine
month the child was adopted by Mrs.
Doyle, liu alleges. Ho claims Mrs.
Doyle did not ask pay for the child's
maluten live, but the sister dlspu'es
this, asserting she. nuver adopted
Catherine ami has always believed she
would bo rtpald the funds spent on
the child.
Mrs. Do, -In says she gave the girl
the best education possible, sending
her first to Scammon's and St. Pat
rick's Con cuts In Chicago and then
to Trinity and Castle Schools in New
Hochelle, St. Rlizabeth'M tVmwnt,
New Jersey, and the Pines of Ch.it
ham, a finishing sdiool for oung la
dles In Ontario. Canada.
This education alone cost $10,000,
.Mrs. Dojle rays, and she asks for an
additional J"i,un for her own time
spent In caring for Catherine. As the
girl Is frail and probably novcr will bo
able to earn her own living, Mrs.
Dovl" alleges It will cost her a great
deal more to care for Catherine In the
future.
Poy. the sister alleges, gave br
about M.000 during Catherines child
hood. The only money given direct to
Catherine. Mrs. Doyle says, by Poy
was $1 for tar fui o and $20 one Christ

Two Sections of Eastbound Limited
in Rear-End Collision Twen

Plunges Into Wreckage Thrown
on Its Track.
DEAD ON WESTERN TRAINS;
WRECK RAILROAD'S WORST.
Cl.li LLANU, March 29. At least thirty perjoib uvrc kiileJ-lli:
exact total may not be known until nightfall and more than forty in
jured in the wreck at 3.15 o'clock this morning of three of the New v
Central's crack passenger trains a mile west of Amherst, O., forty miles
from this city. Twenty-five bodies have already been taken out and fbv
more were known to be in the debris.
W hen the total of dead and injured is finally ascertained the wreck
will surpass in its cost of life even the wreck of the Twentieth Century
Limited at Mentor in i9ol, when the famous train piled into a freight on
its second trip on the New York-Chicago twenty hour run.
The Twentieth Century Limited, which left New York at
j o'clock yesterday afternoon, plunged into the wreckage of a rear-end
collision of two sections of an eastbound limited, mangling- the bodies of
, lhoe who had been killed and killing many who had not been dragged
out ot (lie smashed day coach at the end of the first section of the east-
Nuud train.
Four of the seven cars of the Twentieth Cenlurv were derailed, but
all remained upright. Several of the passengers were severely shaken, cut
and bruised, but none was seriously injured.
One engine of the eastbound section, which composed train No. 86,
known as the Pittsburgh-Baltimore-Utiffalo Limited, was effective after
the wreck, and took a car with the badly hurt to lilyria. The dead were
taken to Amherst. A special train was sent out from Elyria about ten
minutes after the accident with surgeons and a relief train with sleepers
i bnni; nle ie5S seriously injured to Cleveland started from this city at
5 o'clock.
Engineer Herbert Kose of the second section of No. SO stated this
alternoon that his train was travelling fifty miles an hour when it struck
the fitt section. He said the two Mock signals which he passed prior to
the wreck were "clear."
A sleepy towerman is to blame lor the wreck, according to A. S.
Ingalls, General Superintendent of the New York Central. Supt. Ingalls
said the towerman's wife gave birth to a child Sunday night and that the
ti'werman had been without -.Jeep most of the time' since.
The Twentieth Century Limited was replaced on the rails and
went on its way a little after o o'clock, the hours late.
COLLISIONS OCCURRED l THICK FOG.
The last report from tho sections of No St! was at Vermilion, O. They
iuwHcd that station six minutes apart, running at a high rate of speed,
though there wai a dense fog KroTii what can be learned, the engineer of
tho first eoctlon, which carried passengers moving between Chicago and
Buffalo, slowed down to verify a ls'nai a mile went of Amherst.
While ho was looking at the slunal It was thrown against hlta and ha
ttopped. The rear end Hagman was sent M to warn the second' section,
carrying passengers between Detroit and Pittsburgh.
In addition to the fog a heavy exhaust of steam from his locomotive
hampered tho vision of tho engineer of the locomotive of tho second aoctlou.
Ho ran by tho flagman, who had not ImJ time to go hack his full distance,
