A bale of cotton with pine straw
bagging on it was sold on f
this market last Friday. Pine i
straw bagging was plentiful in I
1889 and 1890 when the jute bag <
ging trust was successfully
fought. None of the pine straw f
bagging has been seen on cot- i
ion nere in years until ttie bale *
wrapped in it was marketed last c
Friday. There was a pine straw ?
bagging factory near Wilmington,
but none of that kind of t
covering for cotton bales has t
been made since 1890.
Considerable quantity of liquor f
is being sold here. No, we have r
not seen any of it sold and r
would be a very poor witness for t
the State if anyone was indicted
lor selling booze, but anybody t
knows that it is not artesian c
water that is having such effect e
on 'em. The "corn likker" that is
being sold here may be made of t
concentrated lye, soap, mill feed r
and molasses, but a man told us r
that the stopper is always pure <1
corn cob. n
There was anything but a bull t
time in police circles here last *
Saturday and Saturday night. >
Fourteen arrests were made and
Saturday afternoon there were ^
three scraps in rapid succession i
on the streets. Boozing, gam- t
bling and scrapping kept the f
cops on the go. No, we are t
not bragging about it?just tell- ?
ing about it. It is a mighty bad 1
state of affairs when policemen 1
are busier than other citizens
and it is the raw and unvarnish- ?
ed truth that such was the case I
here last Saturday. While busi- i
ness was fairly good that day, i
nobody did a big business. i
It is not generally known that ?
Helena, Ark., is named for a
lady whose father went from <
this county and that Phillips ?
county, of which Helena is the t
seat, was named for a former t
citizen of Union county. These i
are the facts. Some time prior ?
to 1800 Svlvanus Phillips went i
from Jackson townshib to the i
Arkansas territory. He located ?
in Arkansas county, a very large
county, and in 1818 he was rep- t
resentative from his county in >
the legislature of the territory. ?
That legislature made a new <
cuuui} irum a pan 01 Arkansas I
county and as Representative
Phillips lived in the portion of
his county which was laid off a
for a new county they named f
the county for him. Mr. Phil- r
lips had the honor of naming the s
county seat and he named it for t
his daughter, Helena. c
Col. H. G. Hotchkiss died at
his home in Buford township
last Tuesday morning about 4 t
o'clock. Col. Hotchkiss came
to Buford township, this county,
about 30 years ago. He was a
uuuve 01 i\ew York State and s
first came South as a prospector
for gold and located at the Fun(Jerburk
mine in Lancaster coun- c
ty where he lived four or five t
years. He operated a gold mine 1
at Altan for several years and ?
then went to the Dixie gold n
mine in South Carolina where n
he lived for two or three years, n
and then he returned to Altan, ^
in Buford township, where he
engaged in farming and lived there
until his death. s
Col.,Hotchkiss was a-Federal (
soldier during the Civil war and h
his title was not a mere honor- t
arv one, for he was colonel of a ti
New York regiment. Col. it
Hotchkiss was a progressive v

Villa Slips Away Unhurt
San Antonio, Tex., March 26.
?Francisco Villa has escaped

and three columns of American
cavalry are pursuing him.
Already they are almost 250
niles south of the border and
mless Mexican forces bring ilie

Start Now to Have a Good
Permanent Pasture
We've said it before and we ^
repeat it here, that no man can j
really do the best of farming
without a good permanent pasture.
Some livestock are a ne
cessity on every farm, and no
livestock can be kept most economically
unless there is plenty
of pasturage.
Spring is the season for planning
and making good permanent
pastures, and the wise farm
er will see to it that this problem
gets his immediate attention.
The correct location oi the pasture
is of importance, and as a
rule this should be adjoining the
barnyard, in easy access of all
the farm animals. Its area, of
course, must be (determined by
the number and kind of livestock
kept.
In 90 per cent of all the Cotton
Belt we believe the basis of
the permanent pasture should
be Bermuda grass. It is adopted
to a verv wide range of soil and
climatic conditions, loves hot
weather, and is nutritious. The
turf may be planted at nearly
any time, though for best results
we would plant from April to
June. Seed may be used for (
planting: where the turf is not j
easily obtainable, As a summer- ,
i growing complement to Bermu- i
da, lespedeza should have a *
place in every Southern pasture. (
1 Though an annual, it reseeds it- )
self each fall and thus is perma^ 1
! nent. {
Then to furnish winter and 5
? early spring grazing bur and <
white clover should be sowed 1
1 on the Bermuda. White clover y
1 is a perennial and bur clover, 1
1 though an annual, reseeds itself 1
when once started. A combina- (
tion of these four grazing plants Is
? will, we believe, be found suited (
' to a wider range of conditions j
and have a greater adaptation to 1
our needs than any other. *
; In establishing a pasture let us (
1 not ever forget, either, that the
better treatment we give it the
! greater returns it will give us.
A gullied hillside is not a pas
lure, nor is a woods with a fence 1
around it. The pasture, rightly '
1 handled, is a place for growing s
crops of grasses and clovers, and
the better our methods in pas ^
ture-making the greater the re s
turns will be. Dressings of ^
ground limestone, one or two a
tons per acre, will be found prof- c
itable on most of our pastures, ^
as will 500 to 1000 pounds per
acre of ground phosphate rock
once every three or four years.
Even more nrofitnhlf will it
be to see to it that our pastures i
are growing grasses and clovers
instead of weeds and bushes, c
The successful cotton farmer 1
does not let weeds over-run his 1
crop; why should he let weeds, [
briers and bushes take his pas c
lure? For the larger grubs and t
bushes a grubbing hoe or mat- t
tock, persistently used, will be el- s
fective; for the smaller obnoxi- a
ous weeds, the mowing machine 1
is an excellent remedy. Don't a
i - -1
uver ici me weeds go to seed, /
and the pasture will soon be free e
of them. tl
Why not start now to have a It
good pasture, and start right by tl
having it properly located, seed- p
ed to the proper grasses and d
clovers, and then give it good a
! treatment once it is made? A t
j reallv good pasture will pay
handsome dividends, and no p

successmi ^outnern larm can'Ii

News of Disaster to English
Vessels Being Gathered.
Washington, March 26.?Official
information upon which
President Wilson will decide
whether the sinking of the steamship
Englishman and the damaging
by an explosion of the-channel
steamer Sussex were the result
of acts in violation of international
law is being gathered
from every available source by
consular representatives of the
United States in England and
France. Tangible evidence of
some kind was momentarily ex
pected tonight by the state department.
Dispatches already received
indicate that several Americans
were injured or killed in the
Sussex disaster. Four American
citizens who were aboard the
Englishman and who were said
dispatches yesterday not to be
among the rescued, still are unaccounted
for.
Only one dispatch of importance
concerning the explosion
which damaged the Sussex was
received by the state department
during the day. This contained
an affidavit made in London at
the American embassy by two
American survivors, Edward S.
Huxley and Francis E. Drake of
New York. Both swore that the
explosion occurred "without the
slightest warning," and they
credited the commander of the
Sussex as saying that he saw the
wake of a torpedo before it
struck his vessel.

It seems that some time ago
Charles Pegues and J. Streater
were doing time on the chaingang
and Streater claimed that
Pegues caused him to get a
whipping.
Streater threatened to get even
at the first opportunity. This
opportunity was offered when
both negroes were working the
road recently in the same vicinity.
On last Tuesday without warning,
Streater is said to have
struck Pegues a terrific blow on
the head with a scoop shovel

Pegues was hurried to the

At last report Streater was

Has No Hope For A
Short Campaign
Columbus, N. M., March 26.?
A speedy termination of the
Ameiican expedition into Mexico
is not looked for by General
Pershing, commander of the
forces in the field, according to
advices received here tonight.
It is asserted that following "a
staff conference General Pershing
announced that the people
of the United States should
not place too much confidence
in reports that Francisco Villa,
the factional leader, whose command
attacked this town several
weeks ago, had been bottled
up either by American forces or
by Mexican troons. The nature
of the country it was pointed out
renders it difficult for any force
to surround effectually a small
band in the mountain passes
with almost impassable trails offering
a means of escape.
While it was understood that
i n 1-: * -
vjcuc-iiu i uimiiii^ noes noi attempt
to predict the length of
time American troops may be
in Mexican territory, it was intimated
that the period may extend
into months.
