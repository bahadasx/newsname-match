RUSSI NS SUFFER HEAVY LOSSE
Berlin Reports 80,000 Slavs Have Been
Killed In Recent Attacks on von
Hindenburg's Forces.
London, March 28. German Infantry
in successive wave formation attacked
French positions northwest of Verdun
this afternoon, after a preparatory
bombardment of great slaughter. The
French artillery and rifle fire was re
sponsible for the checking of this as
sault, which extended from Avocourt
to Bethincourt.' The French second
lines of defense east of the Mouse were
bombarded by the Germans, and the
French shelled German positions in the
Woevre.
South of Ypres the British troops
maintained their gains of yesterday in
the face of German counterattacks.
Today's official report from Berlin
as follows:
Lively fighting at close quarters de
veloped south of St. Elol, around mine
craters formed the explosions of Brit
ish mines. The action has extended to
adjacent lines.
On both sides of the Meuse, where
fighting is taking place, there is noth
tng new to report.
Berlin, March 29. Russian casualt
les in the present offensive against
Field Marshal von Hindenburg's array
are estimated in an Overseas news
agency statement yesterday to have
:: been not less than 80,000 along the 75
mile front where engagements have
been in progress. The statement
' says:
"The fruitless attacks of the Rus
sians in which 60 of their divisions
have participated against Field Mar
shal von Hindenburg's front is still
continuing. The Russian casualties are
so far estimated to have been not lees
than 80,000 on a front of 120 kilo
meters. -
"On March 19 seven Russian regi
ments attacked a - German cavalry
brigade. In this fighting the. Russians
lost 3000, while the Germans lost two
killed and six wounded. Later on one
cavalry detachment counter-attacked
and captured 160 Russians.
"The German positions are so excel
lently fortified and provided with such
a number of machine guns and cannon
that it is considered the Russian at
tacks are doomed to failure. The Ger
man lines have not been shaken."
To the Patrons of the Harte Theatre
Essanay is presenting Henry B. Wal
thai in what we consider the most pre
tentious and artistic photodrama ever
offered to the public.
Director Charles J. Brobin, with the
assistance of the author, George C.
Hazelton, has spent many months in
the production of this masterpiece.
"The Raven" is known the world over
as the greatest work of Edgar Allan
Poe. Mr. Walthal has portrayed the
character of Poe with that consumate
skill for which he is noted throughout
the world of photoplays. It remains
only for you to pass Judgment.

GERMANY'S WAR PINCH
More Severe in the Villages Than In
Cities.
The pinch of the great war is felt
daily among the lowly of the powers
in both big and little things, accord
ing to the story of Dr. Wirt H. Bar-
nitz, a war correspondent, who spent
almost a year wandering through the
smaller cities and towns of Germany
and Austria. Dr. Baruitz is an Amer
lean who left for the front early in
1915 to study village conditions, and
returned last January to give lectures
of thrilling air flights over the war
zone and also of how the people fee',
and how they are living during the
greatest war of history. What the
people eat and what they do during
these days of sacrifice interested him
most of all. - -
Koast meat is enjoyed by most of
the population in Germany only once
a week. Twice a week or so a pot
roast finds its way to the table. In
most of the places he visited vege
tables are fairly abundant. Soon the
Inhabitants will have only boiled
meats, for lard and other frying ma
terials are giving out. The chemists
are responding to the situation, how
ever, and are devising some new
faugled method of frying meat. Ever
the rich beer, for which Germany 1:
famous, is losing its rich quality be
cause of the scarcity of barley. Chem
icals are taking the place of some
of the old-established ingredients o'
the national drink until the beer is ex
tremely thin, only a distant relative of
what was imbibed before the war.
'Imagine a paper printing an ar
ticle like that," a member of the Ger
man foreign office complained to Dr.
Barnitz as he pointed to a paragraph
of an American newspaper which said
that bread in Germany was being
made from sawdust. Dr. Barnitz dip
lomatically answered that Americans
were ready to believe almost anything
of the German chemists, and did not
doubt that they could make tread
from sawdust.
"How long can Germany hold out?"
Many say five years. Dr. Barnitz,
however, is of the opinion that Ger
many, can hold out with men, money,
food and munitions for only about
three years. Nor will the people be
content with a draw, they expect vic
tory. No resentment against the
kaiser appears, he said, only the
greatest loyalty is apparent. "But if
you lose, how will you feel toward the
Hohenzollerns? "Lose? its impos
sible." The German mind cannot ad
mit a defeat. So, Dr. Barnitz could
not learn what effect a defeat would
have on the fortunes of the Ilohenzol
lerns. The villages are hushed now. The
sound of musical instruments among
that musical nation Is a rarity. VVher
a child begins to play the organ or
zither, he is reminded that the other
side of the house are mourning the
death of a son or brother or father at
the front. Boys wait at home daily
for the call to the front. Some go re
joicing-others reluctantly because of
family reasons.' Despite the confidence
in ultimate victory and conquest of
German arms, the people are suffer
ing now.
England is the object of Germany's
hate. Their old rival. France, is a
good-natured chum with whom they
have had a difference, in comparison
with the feeling toward England. Re
gret for the death of many innocents
on the Lusltania was very general.
But the Germans cannot understand
why Americans will travel on and
protect British ships. "Why don't they
use a neutral boat?" is the question
they all ask. But England! "Gott
straffe England."

WOULD ROB CATHOLICS
Carranza Scheme To Float More Mexl
can Bonds.
Mexico City, March 27. The pub
lished announcement that the Mexican
government was considering the ad
visability of taking over all the per-
jonal and realty holdings of the Ca
tholic clergy throughout the republic
created somewhat of a sensation here
this morning. In a special dispatch
from Quaretaro, El Democrats, the
official government organ, quotes both
Secretary of the Treasury Cabrera
jnd Dr. Siurob, governor of the state
of Guana Juato, as saying that the
neasure would be made effective un
der the old law dating back more than
iialf a century w hen church edifices
.vera seized during the administration
of Benito Juarez. -
The clergy in the states of Mlchoa
an, Pebla, Quaretaro and Jalisco ure
eyuted to be immensely wealthy in
ewels, lands and works of art which
are held in trust for the church. It is
said that the appropriation of these
by the government for their conver
sion into gold with which to swell the
eserve to be accumulated for the re
Jemption of the paper money issue,
mado necessary by the revolution,
would solve Mexico's present economic
lifficulties. Government official de
larations place the present paper is
sue at 500,000,000 pesos with an in-
jignlficant metallic reserve for its re
demption.
The government is making every ef
fort possible at this time to accumu
late as rapidly as possible the neces
sary reserve in order that the new is
sue of 250,000.000 pesos which it pur
poses to put forth some time in April
may be sufficiently guaranteed tc
stabilize exchange without the neces
sity of resorting to a foreign loan.

Dear Mr. Graham:
As you are being frequently men
tioned for the office of governor, 1 am

Dear Mr. Gilpin: . . i,
I have youd letter of MarcU 18tU in
quiring if I am to be a candidate for
governor at tpe primaries in Septem
ber. I shall be aj candidate for the nomin
ation to the office of governor at the
September primaries. Inasmuch as
under the primary law the platform of
Uie party is to bo made by a conven
tion composed of the nominees for
state senators and town representa
tives and the six elective officers, I
will only say at this time that from my
fourteen years' experience s auditor
of accounts have come -to certain de
finite conclusions as to what will tend
to advance the interests of our state
and make the'government more effi
cient and less expensive.
Later on I will be glad to go into
these matters in detail but for the
present let me say that I feel that we
-houid first adequately care for the
state institutions we have and the
state endeavors we ara engaged upon,
before we take- up new enterprises,
and that certain of our boards and
ommissions enn bo consolidated or
dispensed with without injury to the
public service.
Yours very truly.

WILLARD STANDS ALONE
No One in Sight Now Who Could Give
Him a Battle.
Those who make a close study of the
pugilistic situation asserted yesterday
that there is no heavyweight In sight
who would have a chance of beating
Jess Willard. If the champion does
not decide to quit the ring, it is not
likely that any one could be developed,
within the next few years who could
defeat him. Willard found It a diffi
cult task to get down to 259 pounds
after training for five weeks, and those
Close to him say that it would , bo diffi
cult for him to make this weight agniiL
It is likely that Willard will have to
retire undefeated. If he does, he can
present his title to any one whom he
considers qualified to take it. In
1895 Jim Jeffries did this, when he de
cided to retire. He refereed a bout
between Marvin Hart and Jack Root
at Heno and presented his heavy
weight title to Hart, the winner of the
bout. "Philadelphia Jack" O'Brien al
so claimed it. but his claim was ig
nored, and the championship went to
Hart, who was later defeated by Tom
my Burns. Jack Johnson got the title
when he defeated Burns. Jack Mc
Auliffe also retired undefeated as
lightweight champion, his title going
to Kid Lavigne, who he thought was
best qualified to take it.
NEW PRIMARY LAW
To Be Discussed by Y. M. C. A. Forum
Thursday Evening. t
Tomorrow night the new direct pri
mary law conies up for discussion at
the Y. M. C. A. Forum and Robert E.
Healy will open the meeting with a
presentation of the letter of the law,
Its operation, and its difference from
the convention system.
This meeting is of unusual import
ance, because it will be of educational
valuo to those who are not fully ac
quainted with the operation of the
new law, as well as give those pres
ent an opportunity to be heard.
At the last Forum meeting practical
ly everybody present had something to
say, and all men are cordially invited
to be present tomorrow night and par
ticipate. The attendance is not re
stricted to members.
A difference of opinion as to the util
ity of the new law Is expected, and
while ita adoption cannot be forestall
ed at this late date, an interesting de
bate as to its practical value is likely.
The meeting begins at 8:15.

SEVERU SOLDIERS ARE INJU.1ED
Not by the Enemy But Through a
Railroad Accident Villa Again
Eludes His Pursuers.
San Antonio, Tex., March 30. Couflr
matidtt of reports that Gen Pershing al
ready has been using a portion of the
Mexican Northwestern railroad for
transportation of troops was secured
by Gen Funston yesterday from what
was said to be an unofficial , source.
This information Included a report of
the overturning of two cars and the
injuring of 10 troopers of the 10th cav
airy and Beveral horses. Three of
the men were reported seriously in
Jured. The accident occurred while
the cars were being taken over a tem
porary track that had been built
around the Cumbre tunnel south of
Casas Grandes. One of the rails gave
way and the cars rolled down an em
bankment. Exactly where Col, Dodd's cavalry is
now, or Into how many detachments
It has been divided, was unknown at
Gen. Funston's headquarters yester
day. The exact whereabouts of Gen
Pershing also remained unreported,
but this lack of information created no
uneasiness, for Gen. Pershing still has
orders to work out his own problems.
Full realization f the danger into
which some of the advanced detach
ments must bo moving was acknow
ledged. Villa's known ability as a di
rector of ambuscades has aroused
frank expressions of fear among army
officers that he may catch some of tha
American troops in a mountain trap.
More automobile trucks have been
asked for by Gen. Funston and wh"n
they are placed in service there will
be a lew more than 300 on the lines of
communication. This increased num
ber of automobile trucks will not solve
the problem of distributing supplies to
the advanced troops, however, since a
large part of the troops are operating
far away, from trails over which the
cars can be run. ..
TINKER BUTMAN'S HENS
Difference Between Vermont and Con
necticut Yankees
A letter from a Vermont contributor
to the New York Sun Indicates that the
writer has a working knowledge of the
Yankee character. The letter is as fol
lows: To the Editor ot Tho Sun Sir: We
were waiting in the Town . Hall In
Wiudsor, Vt., for the selectmen and
others of the board of civil authority
to count the ballots on Town Meeting
day, when Hoswell Conant civil war
veteran and just elected to the office
of lister, told this story:
"Remember 01' Man Draper? Waal,
he lived down to the South End on
Bridge street, next door to Tinker But
man's. One day Tinker Butman was
workin' in his gardin an' he see 01'
Man Draper jest comin' outer the house
an' says to him, Mr. Draper, ef I ketch
any o' your hens In my gardin I'll kill
'em an', throw 'em over the fence.'
' "Waal. 01' Man Draper, he speaks
up 'kiinler, gentle like an' Bays: 'Mr.
Butman, ef you ketch any o' my hens
In your gardin you can kill 'em; but I
hev jest one suggestion to make: I ain't
boarding' to home; I board at the wid
der ledtiy's jest the other side o' your
place, an' ef you'll jest throw them
hens over Into the widder leddy's yard
1,11 tell her to pick 'em up an' dress
'em.'
"Waal, Tinker Butman said that was
all agreeable to him. Waal, next day
there was a couple o' dead hens in the
widder leddy's yard, an' she come out
an' fetched 'em Into the house an'
dressed 'cm. Next day there was an
other, an' the widder leddy she fetched
that one Into the house an' dressed it.
"Waal, tho next day Tinker Butman
he see 01' Man Draper again an' up an'
says, 'Mr. Draper, I've killed .three o'
your hens, an' throwed 'em over Into
the widder leddy's yard, an' I give you
to know that ef I ketch any more o'
your hens in my gardin I'll do the same
by 'em.' .....
"Waal, OP Man Draper, he speaks up
kinder gentle like, an' says, 'Mr. But
man, that's all right; but in a friendly
sperrit I hev jest tew suggestions to
make: fust, I don't keep hens, an', sec
ondly, ef you'll take the trouble to
count yourn you'll find 'em three
short.' " .
My friend Gordon S. Oriswold of
Xew London, to whom I repeated this
story, says it would not ring true in
Connecticut, because no Connecticut
Yankee in Draper's place w:ould have
"let on" before all of Butman's hens
were dead. On the other hand, Ethan
A. Chittenden of Brattleboro assures
me that It fits the Vermont Yankee per
fectly, because the latter would have
yielded to the earliest opportunity to
rub It Into his neighbor.

Improvement Association
Begin the fight against the apple
tree Unt caierpi'lar.
What U that boy doing out In
. Hi u .
"I don't know."
"Well go and find out and Ul! him
to stop."
One of the Bennington ladles dis
covered the other day that several
boys were picking something from the
tips of the branches of her apple trees,
She hurried to the yard in order to
catch them red-handed, and was not a
little surprised when they made no -f-
fort to escape. The boys, however,
were sent away with the injunction,
"Do not pick any more."
It is the season to collect all of the
egg masses of the apple tree tent cat
erpillar. It is the last chance this sea
son also as the foliage will soon ap
pear and then the worms. Boys and
girls ia Bennington are ' collecting
them under the inspiration of several
prizes which have been offered and
are Incidentally saving hundreds of
dollars worth of damage to apple
trees In the town.
E. S. Buss has raised money and
is conducting the contest. Many of
the boys and girls are already busy,
particularly lu the village. The coun
try boys have the better chance to col
lect the egg masses but they will need
to look out or the village boys will
get ahead of them.
In a few weeks more these eggs will
hatch and nests will be formed, it will
then be much more difficult to get rid
of the pests. Gather and burn these
egg masses now.
And why not have similar contests
in every other town in the county?
The county association assisted Mr.
Buss In raising the money for prizes
and will assist those in other towns
who will do the same. Make a list of
prizes and secure the money, place a
notice in a store window, with many
samples of egg masses.
In the meantime expect to see boys
and girls breaking and gathering twigs
with peculiar swollen rings on. them,
from your trees.
