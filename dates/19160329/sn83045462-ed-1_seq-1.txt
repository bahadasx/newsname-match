In support of the proposition to place j
ontrol o f ll??* entire system in the'

? HtKUftl that 111 division of jurisdic-j
ion may create friction and he objec- '
ionahle. while the combination of the j

e more economical.
Friction Not Anticipated.
Col. < \ A. F. Flagler. the District en- |
ineet officer in charge of he aqueduct. '
eported that "it is not seen how any j
riction could occur in the dual admin-.
<t ration tir/iess the l.'nited Stat?s failed

which has not occur ed to the

to the aqueduct." H<- also stated
hat if the entire system is placed in
he hands of the District Commissionrs
"there is doubt as to the possibility]
f increasing" economy without deereas- j
rig efficiency."
<Jen. Black concurred in tiiese views.;
The division between jurisdictions is!
homiv Hofinorl ynd clcarh understood. !
'her* appears to be no evidence that
he present arrangement creates fricion
or diffic ulties. Neither does it ap- |
ear that economy will result from j
urning the entire system over to the)
'ornmissioners." lie added that th?- j
ost of the construction and rnainte-I
ante of 11?present system is about j
13.500,ObO. and that the estimated cost!
f th? enlargement of the supply, cou- i
led with the Great Falls power plant, \
i about $15,000,000.

GASOLINE EMM!1

40-Cent Rate to U. S.
in Two Months.

months. Representative Schley!
Howard of (icorgia todav intro-1
luced a resolution authorizing I
the President to declare an em-!
Ijargo on gasoline, so as to pre- i
vent the shipment of American!
supplies of the fluid abroad. The j
resolution was written after ai
talk between Secretary of Commerce
Redtield. who presented
some startling facts.
At the same time Representative
Steenerson of Minnesota introduced
a bill to give the federal
trade commission the power to fix
prices on gasoline and allied
products.

Representative \ an Dyke of j

dailv stacks of letters dc- j
manding that action be taken be-!
fore the price rises to untold
heightProducers
W?nt Forty Cents.
"F was told by Secretary Red field*"
said Representative Howard today,
"that the contract price for gasoline
for government consumption last year
was 11 cents. Now the producers are
coming here for contracts and will not
listen to any suggestions less than 40
cents."
Forty cents a gallon would he less
than the retail price.
' What we ought to have." continued j
Representative Howard, "is action of i
the sort President Roosevelt took at
the time the. coal strike was threatening.
?'oal was scarce, prices were rising
and people in dire distress because
of the situation. Theodore Roosevelt
railed President Baer of the Erie down
to see him. and told him that if the j
strike was not settled in forty-eight i
hours he would send troops into the'
mining regions and that the Cnited '
States would take over the mines. The j
strike was settled in forty-eight I
hours.
"Crude petroleum is one ? f the great ;
natural products of our nation. One of |
its by-products, gasoline, is universally j
used, and science has not yet discovered
an economical substitute for it. A j
restriction of its use by the exaction ;
of exorbitant prices will affect hun- j
dreds of thousands of our people in
every walk of life. The gas engine is f
a great dynamic force in our agricultural.
industrial, commercial and social'
activities.
Continual Rise a Scandal.
"No one in Congress in either branch '
iesires t?> interfere with or impede the!'
trreat prosperity with which this nation |j
is blessed, so long as thai prosperity
is derived from legitimate profits: but :
[he continual rise in the price of gaso
line, arbitrarily fixed bv the refineries.!
aas not only reached the limit of en-j
lurance. but is becoming it national;
scandal.
"The refineries defend their action in ;
fixing the existing and contemplated]
exorbitant prices by savin*; that there
s an increased demand occasioned by '
:he Kuropean war and a decreased pro- |
iuction in crude oil. Neither of the
statements are true if the various governmental
departments, including the
department of t'onunerce, the Interior '
department, the interstate commerce j
;ommission tpipe line hearings! or fed- .
-ral trade commission, are to be cred-i
ted.
"The war in h3urope has not increased

Increased. ; :
"The report of another governmental |
nvestigation. shortly to be made pubic.
will show that the 'on hand' sup- , I
dy is greater than at any time in the ;
listory of the country. <
"The legislation I have asked for to
neet this situation has been enacted
ourteen times by Congress, and ap
iroved by four of the great Presidents
f the I'nited States.
"The discretion my bill gives to the
'resident to lift the embargo when the !
nice of gasoline is fairly fixed has been ! *
leclared constitutional by the Supreme !
.'ourt in a long line of decisions."

VILLA IS SEEKING
A REFUGE AMONG
FRIENDLY INDIANS
Fleeing Toward Tarahumare
Mountain Country Pursued
by U. S. Cavalry.
CARRANZA TROOPS SEEM
TO HAVE NO TRACE OF HIM
De Facto Government Officials at
Juarez Have Ceased to Receive
Reports About Brigand.
MAY GATHER LARGE FORCE
Outlaw Expected to Concentrate ladependent

hL PASO. Tex.. March jq.?
I lie hunt for Francisco Villa by
the flying columns of American
cavalry continued relentlessly today.
but from the meagerness ot
the official dispatches from iien.
Pershing's advanced base it was
impossible to learn the position of
the American troops and how far
they were in the rear of the fleeing
bandits. Villa was last heard
of heading southward toward the
Tarahumare mountain country,
his command driving their Mexican
ponies at full speed and being
closelv pressed by tlie American
troopers.
Commanders of tlic Carranza
troops now in the Chihuahua region
apparently have lost trace
of Villa and bis men. for no report
lias been received by Mexican
officials bere for some time
concerning tbe bandit s whereabouts.
Operating" Around Torreon.
Armed bands of Villa forces are reported
in various parts of Chihuahua
and in Fom<? numbers around Torreon,
l?ut thev are operating: independently
of the main Villa command.
rarranza officials in Juarez expreas
their belief that \"illa will try to establish
a main base at some point after
he has thrown the American cavalry
off his trail, and then recruit his command
to one of larger proportions from
the hands now roving about the southern
Chihuahua district. Villa, the Carrattza
officers think, will then engage
iti a marauding campaign that would
give the American and Carranza forces
no end of trouble.
Army officers here do not believe
Villa will ever make a stand ami fight
the American cavalry, but will continue
in flight until lie escapes or Is
cornered.
Speculation Along the Border.
In the absence of an: official news of
ttie chase, the border has settled down
to speculation, based on such slim facts
as are brought back to the Cnited States
by American mining men and ranchers
who straggle in here.
Americans familiar with Mexico are
almost unanimous in their opinion that
the troops of the north, operating in an
unfamiliar country ami riding the cornfed
horses of the plains, are tremendousl;.
handicapped against the Mexican bandits
on their mountain bred ponies. It is not
a question of nerve or courage. It is a
problem of climatic, topographic and other
natural conditions against which the
stou'est heart and strongest muscles are
practically helpless.
Says Americans Are Handicapped.
An American rancher who is familiar
with the country through which Villa
is retreating; expressed the following
view of th?- situation today:
"I have known Francisco Villa for
twenty years." he said. "For many
years I was the only white man in the
country in which he lived. 1 know his
habits, his processes of mind and the
Tara hu nut ra Indians, among whom he
is at present I have very little hope
that the American cavalry can ever
catch him. now that he has. presumably.
flft\ or more miles start,of it.
Vilia ami his men. mounted on their
Mexican ponies, can travel fort> miles
i da> with ease and fifty miles If
pressed.
"All his men need is a little dried
beef and some rornvneal. With this and
h blanket strapped behind their saddles
thev can travel indefinitely. Compare
this with the equipment of an
American trooper, who makes thirtyfive
miles a day at best.
Tarahumares Will Help Villa.
"The Tarahumare Indians will not
;ive the slightest assistance to the
Americans, but they dig up their last
rrain of corn or wheat for Villa. Mote
han that, the} will give him speedier
nformation about pursuers than the
astest horseman could give. There is
10 horse that could keep pace with
hese Indians in that country. I have
ften sent one of them from mv ranch
0 Minaca. a distance of eighty-two
niles. He could start in the evening
nd reach Minaca the next morning.
1 is almost impossible to tire them,
nd all they need for subsistence is a
tile ball of dried meat that they carry

Difficulties of the Aviators.
The rancher was asked what difference
he thought the introduction of
eroplanes in the chase was going to
