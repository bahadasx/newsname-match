Regarding Sinister Re
ports From Mexico.
PRESIDENT JVILSON ANXIOUS
Will Take Legal Steps If Neces
sary To Quell Inflam
' matory Reports.
.VICIOUS INFLUENCES WORKING
Washington, March 26. While
the administration officials describe
the military situation In Mexico as
serene, yesterday's developments in
Washington forecast a political
struggle here this week with the ad
ministration's Mexican policy the
center.
President Wilson Issued a warn
ing to the people not to he Influenc
ed by alarmist reports regarding the
situation, which he said are being
disseminated by "sinister and un
scrupulous influences" and in the
interest of "certain owners of Mex
ican properties." He reiterated that
every effort should be made to pre
vent the punitive operations from
assuming in public discussion the
color of war.
As he wrote President Wilson had
before him the most reassuring ad
vices from the border since the
American columns began the pursuit
of Villa. They wereysent by Gen.
Funston and satisfied the army of
ficials that the Carranza government
Is doing all in Its power to aid In
the pursuit.
At the Capitol the Senate Repub
licans were called In'ljo conference
by their leader, Senator Galllnger,
to discuss the border situation:
They will moeTagaln Monday, but It
was admitted by those present, that
the sense of tho meeting was that
steps should be taken to compel the
sending of additional troops to
guard tho border States, in effect
meaning the calling out of the na
tional guard.
Officials welcomed the report from
Queretaro, the present seat of gov
ernment of Mexico, that a favorable
fcclsion on the proposed protocol
had been handed by Gen. Carranza
to the American Special Representa
tive Rodgers.
w President Wilson Is said to bo de
trained to stop the circulation of
the Inflammatory rumors and to
take legal steps' if necessary. The
use of the law against the publica
tion of reports tending to Incite "ar
son and riot," tightening of the cen
sorship on Mexican news and warn
ing army officers on the border
against giving out unconfirmed re
ports, are all under consideration by
administration officials.
With the report of the Herrera
Tevolt positively denied by American
Consul Letjcher at Chihuahua City
'and with rumors of impending border-disturbances
received from unof
.flcial sources by members of Con
gress, discounted by reassuring of
ficial advices from points just be
yond the Mexican border, appre
hension aroused In official circles by
the disquieting reports had com
pletely subsided.
President Wilson himself probab
ly will Issue the expected official
statement on alarmist reports from
the Mexican border Instead of hav
ing Secretary Lansing do it, as was
at 'first planned. The President and
the Cabinet are so convinced that
certain reporta aro part of a propa
ganda to force a general interven
tion in Mexico that it was decided
the subject was of sufficient Import
ance to deal with personally.

A WORD TO THE rOUITRV
POOLERS OF OHIO COUNTV
No one can doubt or dispute but
that we have, advanced the price on
poultry In several different countlc3
this year by pooling or collectively
selling and wo find that we have the
same thing to contend with 'when we
try to combine tho other counties
with Ohio, tfiat we had when we
were trying to fight the battle alone.
We find that men who would not bid
strong and other who would not
bind themselves to the contract at
all, are now offering more on the
delivery days than the pool sold for.
I would like to ask why any man
can not see through their motive. I
urge all farmers and poolers to
stand firm by the man that bid the
highest and not sell your honor,
your birthright, for the small sum
of 20c to the hundred pounds of
hens. You remember what a hard
light We had when.we begun in this
county? Can't you see what we
gained by sticking to the pool then?
So let us stand firm and deliver the
goods to the pool car, regardless of
what the other people offer. Now
let us be men of honor who will
stand for our rights and principles
men who will not sell their neigh
bors and friends at any price.
To those who have never signed
a pledge will say that' you can pool
tflll the day you deliver, and that
there will not be a cent collected
from you. The per cent. Is paid by
the purchaser and this price Is net
to you. HENRY M. PIRTLE,
County Sec'y.
WILLAItD THE VICTOR
ON POINTS OVER MORAN
Madison Square Garden, New
York, March 25. Jesa Willard out
pointed Frank Moran in their ten
round slugging match which was
staged here to-night before 12,000
spectators, which made up the larg
est crowd that ever saw an Indoor
pugilistic contest in New York State.
The champion's best fighting was
done from the third round on, de
spite the fact that he broke his right
hand during that period. A small
bone on the back part of the hand
was fractured when ho shot a right
smash to Moran's jaw. No one In
the vast audience knew of Willard's
mishap until the battle was over.
The bout was a surprise. Inasmuch
as both men battled as hard as they
could from gong to gong. Moran
was the aggressor In all but two
rounds, and he frequently rushed
the champion to the ropes. However,
his timing -was poor and he exhibited
but little boxing skill.
CIGARETTES CUT MARKS
OF HOYS IN HIGH SCHOOL
Lexington, Ky March 25. At
least fifty students In the Lexington
High School will probably fall to
graduate this year on account of tho
effects of cigarette smoking, was the
declaration made in a communica
tion from tho city School Board
sent to George Land, Commissioner
of Public Safety, urging tho latter
to use his utmost efforts to enforce
tho laws prohibiting the sale of cig
arettes to minors. It Is stated in the
communication that the grand jury
found that cigarettes could be easily
purchased in Lexington W minors,
but it Is suggested that as there Is
little profit in selling cigarettes the
dealers might bo Induced to volun
tarily bo moro careful in observing
the law. in many cases, tho com
rauslcatlon recites, the cigarettes
are bought by older persons for
boyB, but as the law, prohibits tho
possession of cigarettes by boys un

who had furnished the cigarettes by
promising Immunity to the boys for

SEARCH IS YET IN PROGRESS
Iiexington.
Ky., March 25. A
gold watch charm belonging to and
bearing the name of Samuel W. Bed
ford, the Insurance man, who disap
peared February 18, wns found near
High Bridge, over the Kentucky
river, late yesterday, and the fear
that he was murdered by tramps as
he went down the rough pathway to
spend the night with a kinsman, is
Increased.
The ornament wns about fifty feet
from the Cincinnati Southern rail
road at the Mercer county end of
the bridge. W. M. Winkle, a farm
er, while passing along the secluded
winding footpath leading down the
precipitous bluff on the south side
of tho track toward the Shakertown
ferry, found the charm burled under
a mass of leaves and rubbish, near
a large stone. It was brought to
Lexington and turned over to J. W.
Carter, grand secretary of the
Knights of Pythias, and other
friends of the missing man.
Mr. Bedfoid never reached the
home of the relative on the Shaker
town road and it Is now believed
that after leaving the station ho
crossed tho river and took the path
which runs down the steep cliff, a
known re.idexvous of tramps. It Is
now feared he wa3 killed and robbed
In this lonely spot and his body
thrown into the river, long since
drifting away.
After finding the gold emblem
Mr. Winkle notified Charles Dor
man, at High Bridge, and they call
ed up J. W. Carter in this city on
the telephone. Arrangements were
mado for Mr. Winkle to come to
Lexington.
Mr. Bedford's family have left
this city since his disappearance and
upon Mr. Winkle's arrival ho wat
mot by Mr. Carter and other mem
bers of a committee. Tho commit
tee identified the ornament as hav
ing been worn by Mr. Bedford, and
Mr. AVJnklo told how he discovered
It.
While at the High Bridge station
Mr. Bedford had occasion to open
his pocketbook, in which were sev
eral bills. It is now suspected that
a tramp saw tho money and follow
ed him across tho bridge.
James Stewart, of tho Lexington
Detective Department, went to High
Bridge and spent the day in tho vi
cinity, but was unablo to get any
further clew. A dragnet will bo
thrown out around the locality and
the country on both aides searched.
Tho river was dragged several
weeks ago by a United States
dredgeboat. A friend of Bedford
was confident he saw him In Louis

Meeting
WHICH WILL HI ON APRIL 4
Statement From the Operators
Sets Forth Their Views of
the Situation.
A SETTLEMENT IS EXPECTED
Tho Louisville Evening Post of
Saturday says:
Nearly all of the Western Ken
tucky miners and most of the opera
tors who came to Louisville several
day? ago to make an effort to agree
on a wage scale for a term of three
years, have returned to their homes,
and nothing more will be done until
the Joint Scale Committee lesumes
Its session here April 4.
Despite the fact that the negotia
tions up to the adjournment Friday
proved the operators and miners to
be far apart, the representatives of
both sides went home still hopeful
that some way will be found to
reach an agreement.
As far as terms are concerned no
change has developed from the posi
tion taken by either side. The mi
ners ask an increase of 5 per cent.
In time work and a flat increase of
3 cents a ton in mine run work. The
operators say that not only Is an in
crease of any kind Impossible, but
that the mines cannot be operated
unless the wage scale Is reduced and
a reduction of 20 por cent. Is pro
posed. The operators contend that if
wages are decreased it will be possi
ble 'to provide much more constant
employment for the miners and that
the Income of the miners will be
larger, taking In a whole year. At
present the miners work only thirty
weeks In a year and a number of
mines have been closed since the In
crease of wages In 1912.
The miners admit that something
must be donp to encourage the re
opening of closed mines and to In
sure more steady work In the other
mines but do not believe a reduc
tion of wages will help.
An encouraging sign Friday was
that both operators and miners left
the conference in good humor. No
bad feeling has developed and this
fact causes general optimism of a
final nsreement.
Operator.' Statement.
The following official statement
w-as given out by the Western Ken
tucky Coal Operators' Association:
At this morning's session of the
Joint Scalo Commltteo an adjourn
ment was asked by the miners until
April 4, at which time we have
agreed to meet them and discuss
further a wago question for tho
next year. The miners have asked
an Increase of 3 cents per ton fiat,
with 5 per cent, on day labor and
dead work. Tho operators, on the
other hand, have asked for a 20 por
cent, straight reduction on all labor
In tho production of coal.
Tho arguments used by the mi
ners, that advances havo been made
in fields north of tho Ohio river, can
havo no bearing in our case, duo to
tjie fact that wo Jiro not Jn any
sense competitors with that field.
Our markets aro entirely In the.
South, and aro covered by our non
union competitors on tho samo or
moro favorable frolght rate basis as
our field, therefore wo can only be
compared with competitors with
whom wo come In .contact in tho
markets that wo both reach.
Tho hiffi cost of living Is urged
by tho miners as another reason for
an Increase In wages, which wo
might justly admit under normal
conditions, but plnccd as we are un
der such competj'lva restrictions,
this question must be considered
from every viewpoint, thoso touch
ing tho employer as well as employe
Tho material entering into equip
ment, gonornj repair work, necessa
ry supplies about tho mlnc3 havo
advanced within tho last twelve
months from 25 to 300 per cent. Wn
contend that the problem of the high
cost of living can bo moro substan
tially met for the minor by, accept
ing a dccreaBo In wages with its con
sequent Increase in tonnage than by
the miners demanding an Increase
In wages with Its consequent reduc
tion In tonnnge.
We believe that our proposition,
rather than being harmful to our
employes, will In tho end be helpful.
This can be substantiated by refer
ence to public records, briefly sum
marized as follows: From 1912,
the year in which wo made our last
advance In wages, to 1915 Inclusive,
organized labor In our employ lost
to competitive non-union fields, by
whom wo are surrounded, an aggre
gate tonnage amounting to 2,858,
400. This loss Is directly traceable,
ns we see It, to competitive labor
conditions. This loss In tonnage has
grown, In the four years referred to,
from 445,000 tons In 1912 to 1,
133,000 tons In 1915, which, rough
ly estimated, represents a loss to
the miners of our operators of ap
proximately one and three-quarter
million dollars, which, under a com
petitive wage scale, together with
Its revenue, would have held In our
territory.
This moraine's papers credit to
the miners' organization a statement
to the effect that the proposed re
duction would show a loss to labor
of $432,000, and the Increase pro
posed by the miners would only
show them a gain of $50,000. Even
undor the reduction asked by the
operators, the increased tonnage
brought to the field, by being placed
on a competitive basis, would show
a large Increase of earnings to the
miners in the aggregate.
For Instance, recovery of the ton
nage lost in 1915 would show an in
creased revenue of $550,000 to tho
miners; whereas, another year un
der present conditions, would show
a loss to our miners In a constantly
increasing ratio, which, at a conser
vative estimate, would be In t'.e"
neighborhood of $900,000.
Since the 1912 advance in wages
ten mines in our district have been
closed down and are not now being
operated.

San Antonio, Tex., March 26.
Francisco Villa has escaped from
the Mexican troops that had check
ed him near Nainiqulpa, and three
columns of American cavnlrj are
pursuing him.
Already they are almost 250 miles
south of the border, and unless Mex
ican forces bring the elusive bandit
to a stand, this distance will be
greatly Increased by the close of the
week.
Villa's success In extricating him
self from the dangerous position
Into which he had been driven by
the American punitive force was re
lated in a detailed report by Gen.
Pershing that reached Gen. Funston
here to-day.
Gen. Funston forwarded the re
port to Washington without making
public any but the essential fea
ture. Col. Dodd Is commanding the ad
vanced columns that are riding hard
after Villa and his men, and Gen.
Pershing has divided his forces so
as to provide supporting columns
along tho thinly stretched lines of
communication from his most ad
vanced base at El Valle. From El
Valle another line Is being maintain
