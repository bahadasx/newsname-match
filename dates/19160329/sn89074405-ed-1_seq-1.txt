INDICATE USE OF ROAD.
Washington, March 29.—While
no word has come from Special
Representative Rodgcrs at Querre
taro concerning the request for the
using of the Mexican railways to
transport supplies to General Per
shing's troops, there were indica
tions in official dispatches from
General Perahlng through Funs
ton
that troops are using the railways
in the Cosas Grandes district, prob
ably upon permission from local
Carranza officials.
The dispatch that Saddler George
A. Hudnelt of the Tenth cavalry
had died from Injuries received in
a railroad wreck is taken to mean
that the troops are being transfer
red by railroad southward from
Cases Grande*.
El Paso, Tex., March 29.—The
chase for Villa by Hying columns of
American cavalry goes relentlessly on.
but from the meagerness of official
dispatches from general Pershing's
advanced base,
}t'
learn the
is impossible to
position' of the American,
now.far they are iriC'fMf
bkndit. Villa,
when last heard of, was heading
southward toward the Tarahumare
mountain country, and his command,
driving their Mexican ponies at full
speed, were being closely pressed by
the American troops.
Lose Trace of Villa.
Commanders of the Carranza
troops now in the Chihuahua region
apparently, have lost trace of Villa
and his men, for no report has been
received by Mexican officials here for
some time concerning Villa's where
abouts.
Armed bands of Villa forces are
reported in various parts of Chihua
hua and in some numbers in To.rreon,
but' they are operating Independently
of the main Villa command.
May Establish Base.
Carranza officials in Juarez express
their belief that Villa will try to es
tablish a main base at some point
after he has thrown the American
cavalry off his trail, and then recruit
his command to one of large propor
tions from Villa bands in southern
Chihuahua-
Villa, Carranza officers think, will
then engage in. a marauding cam
paign that would give American and
Carranza forces no end of trouble.
Army officers here do not believe Villa
will ever make a stand and fight the
American cavalry.

Supreme Court so Decides in
Regard to Power Com

Herald Special Service)
Bismarck, N. D., March 29.—The
supreme court today handed down an
opinion In the case of State, ex rel
Andrew Miller vs. Addison Leach, au
ditor of Cass co.unty, wherein subdi
vision 14, section 2088 of the 1918 ses
sion laws, providing for the assess
ment of heat, light and power compa
nles by the tax commission, is held
to be unconstitutional.
In 1914 Leach refused to place upon
-the assessment rolls the assessment of
heat, light and power companies, and
by a tax commission mandamus, pro
ceedings were brought against him. It
was upheld in district court,'and on
appeal .the supreme court declared
this proposition unconstitutional for
the want of due process of law. The
tax commission law provides for the
assessment of this property by the
commission, but does not provide for
the time of hearing.
The eourt held that the failure to
provide for a time of hearing was
In contravention of constitutional pro
visions providing for due process.
The court did not pass upon any
other constitutional questions raised.
Th* tax oomtpiseion still retains gen­
eral

and taxation laws. The local assessor

causing serious washouts to the
Northern Pacific main, line, rose sev

inches of extremely heavy wet snow

WARCONKRENCE
ENDED TUESDAY
Momentous Question Han
dled Quietly and Ex
peditiously.
Paris, March 29.—The conference
of the military and civil chiefs of the
governments of the entente allies, at
which momentous questions regarding
the war were taken up for considera
tion and decision, ended late yester
day.
Never, perhaps, have deliberations
so important had so little written
about them. Thirty-seven persons
took part, yet the proceedings are un
derstood to have gone forward with
out the least confusion because the
subjects to be considered had been
worked out In advance by each of
those whose Judgment on any military,
political or economic question was to
be submitted.
The conference separated into
groups acoordlng to the questions to
be determined, this process facilitat
ing the reaching of common under
standings.
The decisions of the conference
have the force of the decisions of the
respective governments, because each,
with the exception of Russia, was rep
resented by Its principal ministers and
generals.'
The delegates left last night and to
day in the same salient and unobstru
slve way that they assembled. Pre
mier Asquith and Field Marshal Earl
Kitchener will visit Italy before re

Congressman Steenerson In
troduced Bill Today—
He Explains It.
(Herald,Special Service.)
Washington, March 29.'—Congress
man Steenerson today introduced a
bill to regulate the price of gasoline.
^interview, Mr. Steenerson said
his bill is in the form of an amend
ment to the federal trade commission
law. It defines petroleum, gasoline.
Kerosene and fuel oil and classified
dealers in said commodities in larger
quantities than 3,000 gallons as
wholesale dealers In petroleum" and
requires the posting of prices in their
places of business and the filing of a
list of such prices with the commis
sion. All prices are required to be
Just and reasonable, and upon com
plaint that such prices are unjust and
unreasonable the commission is given
power to prescribe Just and reasonable
maximum prices to be maintained in
the future and to order dealers to
cease and desist from charging higher
prices than prescribed by the com
mission.
The United States courts are given
Jurisdiction upon application of the
attorney general at the request of the
commission, to issue writs of manda
mus commanding the dealer not to
charge in- excess of the prices pre
scribed under penalty of $1,000.
The theory of this bill, its author
said, is that the power of congress to
regulate inter-state and foreign com
merce is not limited to prescribing
conditions and prices of transporta
tion as in the commerce act, and reg
ulating' competition as in the Clayton
anti-trust law, but is plenary and ex
tends to -the regulation of commerce
itself, being the sale and exchange of
goods. The fact that confess has not
exercised the power heretofore It no
argument against its existence, Mr.
Steenerson declared.

ED ARE NOT EXPECTED TO LIVE
Some of the Victims Are Decapitated,
While Arms And Legs And Portions

Harrowing Scenes Follow
Cleveland, Ohio, March 29.—At least 30 persons
were killed and close to 30 seriously injured in a double
wreck of three of the New York Central's fastest and
finest trains at Amhurst, 37 miles west of Cleveland at
4 o'clock this morning.
MANY OF INJURED ARE DYING.
A number of the injured, taken to the hospital at
Elyria, Ohio, are reported dying.
Three trains were in the wreck—two sections of
the Chicago-Buffalo Flyer, eastbound, and the Twen
eieth Century Limited, the pride of the New York
Central, westbound. The engineer of the first section
of the flyer was stopped at Amhurst by signal. In the
fog, the second section of the flyer crashed into the first
section, throwing wreckage from both sections over on
the westbound high speed track. Into this pile of
wreckage, the Twentieth Century train crashed, re
sulting in its derailment. Most of the dead were in
the rear coach of the first section of the flyer. There
were 40 passengers in this car. When the second sec
tion came up from behind, it tore into the standing
train.
TWENTIETH CENTURY PLOWS INTO WRECKAGE.
of tlie dead were found In the rear coaches of the second wr
«T the flyer, which" buckled over onto the Twentieth"" Centnty*
.. tofway.and composed a mass of wreckage through which" the
Twentieth Oeaitury n&tttfy plowed Ita way berore being thrown from
the rails. There were- no dead among the passengers on the Twen
tieth Century, though a number of the passengers were badly hurt on
this train. Two coaches of tlie Twentieth Century were overturned.
The low casualties on the Twentieth Century are attributed to the fact
that the palace train was proceeding comparatively slowly becau9c of
the dense fog. Tlie second section of the flyer, however, was going at
a high rate of speed, when it struck the first section, which was tak
ing water.
MANY OF THE VICTIMS UNIDENTIFIED.
Many of the dead probably will go to their graves unidentified.
These were asleep in the rear day coach or tlie first section of the
flyer. Many of these scantily clad victims were horribly mangled,
and Identification without the guidance of their outer clothing will be
impossible. Some of the victims were decapitated. Anna, legs Mid
portions of human bodies were scattered thickly through the splintered
and twisted piles of wreckage.
Relief parties collected the remains of a number of bodies of wom
en and men piled there, indiscriminately in baskets. The body of one
fireman, badly crushed, was found 011 top of the boiler of one of the
engines. Some members of the crews of the three trains involved In
the wreck escaped with scratches and bruises.
C. C. Robinson of Toledo, engineer of tlie Twentieth Century limit
ed, crawled uninjured from under his engine, after the engine bad
plunged 100 feet along tics. His fireman and the conductor also were
unhurt.
RELIEF TRAIN SENT OUT.
Several wrecking and relief trains were sent from various points of
the division, and the work of clearing the debris proceeded rapidly.
Seldom has such a mass of twisted, broken and jammed passenger
rolling stock been witnessed along the lake Shore lines.
At least thirty were killed—tlie exact total may ltot lie known until
night—and more than forty were injured in the wreck. Twenty-five
bodies bad been recovered from the wreckage at noon, and five
were known to be in the debris.
SURPASSES FAMOUS 190-1 WRECK.
When the total dead and injured finally Is ascertained, the wreck
will surpass, in the cost of life and injured, the week of the Twenti
eth Century limited at Mentor, Ohio, in 190-1. when the famous train
piled into the freight on its second trip on the New York-Chicago
24-hour run.
PORTION'S OF HUMAN BODIES HURLEl) ABOUT.
The stories of numerous survivors are harrowing in the extreme.
Aaron De Ray of Pittsburg, said lie was cat pulled from Ills berth into
one occupied by a woman across the. aisle, when the crash came, and
thus escaped injury. A. Comensky of Pittsburg, coming from Chica
go. f*id he saw a woman die in the wreckage before he could extri
cate her. He also saw a man whose arms had been torn from their
sockets.
The wreckage of the fated day coach presented a grewsome pic
ture, and rescuers were appalled by the heartrending scenes.
Day light, had not yet appeared when the three trains plied up to
gether. Farmers and villagers rushed to the assistance of the strick
en passengers.
RESCUE WORK IS HAMPERED.
The work of rescuing those pinioned under the wreckage was ham
pered by tlie darkness and fog. Ambulances, automobiles and all
kinds of vehicles were rushed from Elyria and other points to the
wreck.
Despite the fact that it had left the track and that considerable
damage was done to the front portions, the Twentieth Century limit
ed. with a new engine, proceeds on its way to Chicago a «ompaHatlv®
ly short time after the •wreck occurred.
Its all-steel construction uudoubtedly saved its passengers from seri
ous injury and possible death.
