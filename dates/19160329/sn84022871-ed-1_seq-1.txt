Special Town Meeting Does Business.
The special town meeting called for
yesterday at Seaver's hall was in
session about an hour. F. W. Baldwin
was elected to preside over its deliber
ations and the first item of business,
the election of a road commissioner to
take the place of E. C. Drown, re
signed, was taken up. Mr. Drown
explained why he had resigned, giving
as chief cause that he could not afford
to do the work for the price allowed.
He said he had consulted the selectmen
and they bad given him no encourage
ment about getting additional pay for
his team. The selectmen said there
was a misunderstanding and that they
did not suppose they had any authority
to establish pay or allowances for a
road commissioner. In proceeding to
nominations the name of Mr. Drown
was presented, as was also the name
of Fred Ingalls. On the first ballot
only 30 votes were cast. Mr. Drown
had 15, Mr. Ingalls 14, and there was
one scattering. On the next ballot Mr.
Ingalls had 19 of the 36 votes and was
declared elected.
Mr. Baldwin was made town grand
juror in place of F. W. Cutting, re
signed, and the matter of a second
constable for the north end of the town
was passed over. It was voted to
leave the question of a school play
ground for the South Barton school
and all questions pertaining to that
building and its location to the school
directors. The vote was preceded by
considerable discussion and many sug
gestions. The article regarding the
erection of a schoolhouse in the Ora
White district, so-called, was passed
over.

GRAHAM A CANDIDATE
State Auditor of Accounts, an Orleans
County Man, to Run for Governor.
Well Qualified.
The following letters are self
explanatory. Barton, Vermont,
March 18, 1916.
Horace F. Graham, Esq ,
Craftsbury, Vermont.
Dear Mr. Graham :
As you are being frequently men
tioned for the office of governor, I am
taking the liberty of writing you and
inquiring if you will be a candidate for
the office at the primaries in Septem
ber. Hoping to hear from you, I am,
Sincerely,
Wallace H. Gilpin.
Craftsbury. Vt.,

Wallace H. Gilpin, Esq ,
Barton, Vt..
Dear Mr. Gilpin :
I have your letter of March 18th
inquiring if I am to be a candidate for
governor at the primaries in Septem
ber. I shall be a candidate for the nomi
nation to the offite'of governor at the
September primaries, inasmuch as
under the primary law the platform of
the party is to be made by a convention
composed of the nominees for state
senators and town representatives and
the six elective officers, I will only say
at this time that frfm my fourteen
years" experience as auditor of ac
counts I have come to certain definite
conclusions as to what will tend to
advance the interests of our state and
make the government more efficient
and less expensive.
Later on I will be glad to
these matters in detail but
present let me say that I feel
should first adequately csre
go into
for the
that we
for the
state institutions we have and the state
endeavors we are engaged upon, before
we take up new enterprises, and that
certain of our boards and commissions
can be consolidated or dispensed with
without injury to the public service.
Yours very truly,
Horace F. Graham.
Horace F. Graham was born in New
York on February 7, 1862, and is
therefore 54 years old. He was edu
cated in the common schools and
Craftsbury academy. He graduated
from Columbia college school of polit
ical science and law in 1888 and set
tled in Craftsbury the same year. In
October of that year he was admitted
to the Vermont bar and began the
practice of law which profession he
has followed with success. On his
father's side, Mr. Graham's ancestry
traces back to 1645, when they emi
grated from Dorsetshire, England to
Greenwich, Conn., and is a descendant
on his mother's side from the Stuart,
Brock and Hovey families, who came
from Scotland and settled in Barnet
and Peacham.
Mr. Graham has held all the usual
town offices within the gift of the
people of Craftsbury and was state's
attorney for Orleans county from 1898
to 1902 He was a member of the
Vermont house from Craftsbury in
1892 and again in 1900. In both ses
sionvhe held important committee posi
tions and was a leading member of the
house.
In 1902 Mr. Graham was elected
auditor of accounts and has been re
elected each biennial term since, thus
having served the state in this capac
ity 14 years. His administration has
been a marked success. In 1900 he
was a presidential elector and during
his term as auditor has held several
important appointive positions. He
was made a member of the educational
commission by Governor Fletcher, which
investigated the public school system
of the state and made a report with
recommendations. He was a member
of the commission appointed by Govern
or Gates to make recommendations
for a uniform town accounting system.
He is also a member of the commission
having in charge the building of the
new .state building at Montpelier and
its secretary, and a member of the
state board of public accountants.
Mr. Graham has been in the lumber
business quite extensively and has
always been active in town county and
state affairs. While studying law with

school there for a time.
The Cornell Reading course published
by the agricultural department of
Cornell university has been received at

Methodist Episcopal Church Notes.
Subject of the morning sermon was
"A Backward Look." Text in Genesis
4, 10, "What has thou done?" Only
a few of the many important thoughts
can be given. God still puts this ques
tion which he put to Cain long years
ago, and sooner or later it must be
faced for eternity. What have been
the great outstanding facts and motives
of your life in the psst 12 months?
Has God's work been foremost in your
thought or has it been poshed into the
background? As a professing Christian
and member of the church what have
you done to build it up? Have you been
honest with God? Have you given
him the first place in your heart; the
best of your talents, time and money?
What sort of a record have you been
making? Many of us have been keep
ing the recording angel pretty busy.
How does your account actually stand
before God now? If every member of
the church had acted the part you have
acted the past year, what kind of a
year would it have been? A year of
real progress or of stagnation and
death. God expects of us service in
proportion to our ability. To whom
he has given much, he will require
much. The eves of someone are on
you, have been on you for a long time.
Your example and influence are
potent factors in shaping the lives of
those around you If someone has
been following in your footsteps, where
have they been going? What hast
thou done?
The evening talk was on a problem
in Bible arithmetic, "What shall it
profit a man if he gain the whole world
and lose his own soul?" The question
which sways the world at the present
time is one of profit and Joss. Men
make any sacrifice necessary to acquire
money. Watching the things people
do to acquire it, one might think that
the possession of gold was the greatest
thing in life. The world's indeed a
wonderful place but the first thing we
should naturally consider is a title to
it. If you give up everything to it
can you get a clear title to it? You
may die in an hour and then where is
your popsession? The world according
to scientists may burn up some day,
and where is your title to be then? To
those men who have sought only the
world havea come trouble and misery
Note Byron, Napoleon and many
others in their testimony to this effect.
How shall we estimate the value of
a soul? It is the most exquisite organ
ization in the world. It works so
quietly.- Judgment, memory, con
science, understanding and will, doing
their work noiselessly. The most pre
cious of blood was shed for the soul.
What a price was paid for it! By
this fact and the wonderful home pre
pared for it, we should gain a small
idea of the value God places upon the
soul. Surely, when placed in the
balance against the elusive world and
all its pleasures, the soul far out
weighs it all.
There will be no more services in the
church until prayer meeting Thursday,
April 6th, as the pastor will be at
Montpelier attending the annual con
ference. All present at the morning service
very much enjoyed the beautiful roses
sent in by Mrs. C. P. Jenness.
Mrs. Elizabeth Hopkins, wife of the
late John B. Hopkins of Peterboro, N.
H., died March 22 at the hospital in
Marlboro, Mass., where she went
March 12 for an operation. She would
have been 75 years old May 15. She is
survived by a daughter, Mrs. M. J.
Elliott, South Rehoboth, Mass., a son,
George Hopkins of Providence, R. I.,
and Charles E. Hopkins of Hudson,
Mass., with whom she was living prior
to her illness, also four grandchildren
and one great-grandchild. She went
to Peterboro from Barton in 1898. Her
illness extended over a period of three
months.

LETTER FROM TEXAS
In response to letters written by
members of the commercial geography
class, of Barton academy and graded
schools to persons in other states, the
following letter has been received.
Cisco, Texas,
March 10, 1916.
Mr. Leslie Elliott,
Barton, Vt.,
Dear Friend.
It has fallen to my lot to answer
your letter and I take pleasure in
doing so.
Cisco has a population of about 3,000.
It lies in the northwest corner of
Eastland county, on the ninty-ninth
meridian west longitude, and thirty
two and one-half, nor;h latitude.
Cisco has a number of business firms,
such as all cities have, but unlike the
northern towns it is located in the
cotton region. It has two gins, a
cotton compress and an oil mill. To
supply these, the country communities
plant cotton. They begin planting it
in April or May and thin it by hoeing
it after it is out of the ground. Two
or three weeks after it is thinned, it is
gone over with a cultivator which
throws the dirt to the roots. While it
is growing it puts on squares, then
blooms. The blossoms are of many
colors, some being white, pink and
cream, all in the same stalk. They
are white the first day and turn red as
they grow older. The blossom forms a
boll, this the sun opens into a burr
filled with cotton. The cotton is picked
by hand by men, women and children
some picking four or five hundred
pounds a day. When it is picked it is
brought to the nearby towns where it
is ginned. The bale usually weighs
five hundred pounds fifteen hundred
before ginning. By this you see the
lint weighs only one-third as much as
the seed cotton. After it is ginned
the seed goes to the oil mill ; then the
cotton is hauled across town to the
compress where it is pressed into small
er bales for shipping. The seeds are
hauled to the oil mill where they are
put in a large building called seed
house. Here men shovel them into
conveyers that carry them to room No.
1, where the small amount of lint i3
taken off. Then they are run through
a conveyor into room No. 2, where
the seeds are ground ; they are then run
through large steel shifters where the
hulls of seed from the meal, a yellow
substance inside the seed. The hulls
are run through a conveyer into the
hull house where they are sold as feed
for cattle. The meal is then run into
room No. 3, where it is cooked, then
pressed into cakes.
The oil is manufactured into cotto
lene, which is used for cooking. The
cakes are carried into room No. 4,
where they are crushed into small
pieces. Some of this is sacked and
shipped to the plains to feed the cattle.
"The crushed cake that is not shipped
is run through machinery where it is
ground into a powder. This is called
cotton seed meal. It is put up in hun
dred pound sacks, then taken to another
room, where it is sold as feed for
cattle. Many carloads of meal and
hulls are shipped westward from Cisco
every year. The cotton and its by
product are very valuable. Texas
leads all other states in the Union in
the production of cotton. It brings
many millions of dollars each year.
Hoping this communication will be of
interest to you, I remain,
Yours truly,
John Nichols.
