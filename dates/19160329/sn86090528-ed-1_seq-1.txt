His first active service was 'in sup
pressing the Cheyenne uprising un
der Little Wolfe in Nebraska in the
70s. ,
For 27 years Dodd was attached to

HAMRICK IS
OF CHARGE
C. L. Hamrick, editor of the Tuttle
Times, was tried by a jury in Judge
Hosey's court at Tuttle yesterday and
acquitted of charges of having upon
his person a revolver, on the 19th day
of March. A great deal of interest
was manifested in the case and the'
attorneys experienced considerable
trouble in securing a jury. The first
venire of 32 men was exhausted in
short trder with only two of tho
reeded six jurors selected. The most
of the first venire, disqualified them
selves and were excused for cause
through tatin? that they had formed
ana ex,.")ssea opinions as 10 me ue-
fcndant's guilt. Additional talesmen
vere called in and the jury was final
ly complete after 43 men had been
i-n'led and examined.
The trial of the case began at 2
o'clock in the afternoon and was hnr
iled through as rapidly as possible
and given to. the jury before supper
time. Howwer, it was almost eight
o'clock before the jury arrived at an
nereement and brought in a verdict
of "not guilty."
Tha defendant acknowledged that he
was armed on the day and date as set
forth in the complaint, but alleged
that ho was a regularly appointed
posseman, under Deputy Sheriff Dan
Sneil and alleged further that on the
date .named in the information the
regular deputy, Snell, had called upon
hira to aid in searching another man
In Tuttle for a gun and that for these
reasons It was not a violation of the
statutes or Oklahoma for him to have
upon his person a gun at the time as
charged in the complaint.
The state .was represented in the
matter by Allan K. Swan, assistant
county attorney, while tho defense
was represented by Judge Eugene
Hamilton and Ben Goff, both of the
Chickasha bar.

Adjustment of Lusitania Case and Armed
Merchantman Controversy Sou?,Lt by
President in Connection with
Sussex Disaster
3y United Press.
Washington .March 29. It is un
derstood that a complete settlement
cf the whcle submarine question, in
hiding the Lusitania case and the
armed merchantman decree, is in the
president's mind in the steps that are
being taken at the present time to de
termine the responsibility for the
Sussex disaster.
According to the best information
attainable, if a German U-boat 'wai
responsible, ft will be held that the
Gorman 'government must disavow
the act, punish the submarine com
mander, make reparation and agree
to abido by the principles of interna
tional law, which is said to mean the
abrogation of the armed merchant
man decree.
To obtain full satisfaction, it is be
lieved that the admfnistratlonu is pre
pared to fro its full length even to the
print of breaking oft diplomatic rela
tions with Germany.

GEN. PERSHING
IS INTERVIEWED
By United Press.
El Paso, Texas., March 29.
It General Tershing and his
flying column should capture Fran.
Cisco Vlila today and Villa should ask
the general what he vas goUi to do
with hra, Pershing probably would
counter with; j
"Well, Villa, what do you think
about itf"
For Pershing, as newspaper men
had ample opportunity to learn when
he was here. Is not a communicative
man. "
Before you coul l see General Persh
ing, you had to warm an already over
heated chair in an outer office.
Major Hines, post adjutant, who
had a desk in the same voora, would
get a ons? distpnee call over the
phone. He'd bawl to an orderly, nod
signili'-autly at you, and the orderly
po'ilely ould shove you back into
the hall. You felt like the frog in the
viell, that jumpel one foot and fell
hack two.
Filially you were ushered into the
presence of the man who is leading
the American expedition into Mexico.
Pershing has a very good memory to.
faces and names and correctly tails
you when you greet him.
"Well, general, when you going
in?" -
"Haven't the. least idea; what's the
latest from Washington?"
"War department isn't giving out
much. San Antonio, says you're to
have char?e, though."
"Your information pretty reliable?"
"Sure. How long is it going to take
you to catch Villa?"
"What do you think about it?"
"I'll svp opinions with you. Six
months."
"Ahem."
"Where was that bunch of the Six
teenth hound for?"
"West."
"Whereabouts?"
The general evidently Is a close
student of the European war.
"'Somewhere in New Mexico,'" he
grins.
The phone lings. The general nods
toward tho door. You've gothat mo
tion down pat now, so you beat it.
On the way out you tackle Major
Hines, Captain Godson and everybody
else wearies leather leggings (the in
fallible insignia of an officer). They're
about as full of news as a recipe book.
After doing the rounds of the gov
ernment officers and other sources
of information you go back to Fort
Bliss and start all over again. About
tho third time you become so profi
cient in "question and answers" that
you can beat tho "interviewee" to it
every time.
An American correspondent on the
I order now has about the same status
as a Villlsta spy.

Battle Planned for April.
(By William Thilip Sims, Uuited
Press Staft Correspondent.)
Paris, March 12. (By mail.)
A close study of the Battle of Ver
dun proves it to. have been a freak ot
r.ature, like January strawberries, or
peach-blossoms in December.
Tha Battle of Verdun was planned
for April or May, but in the German
n ilitary plans there was an "unless,"
which, when followed by tho remain
der of the sentence, read: ''Unless
by some strange atmospheric phenom
enon we get a long spell of fine, dry
weather b-ifore that time."
True to Teutonic traditions of pre
paredness, as ef.rly as December tho
Germans began bringing up material
for use iu the attack. Every availa
ble big howitzer, including the 303s
and the 423s, was hauled to the Ver
dun sector through which the Crown
Prince hoped to make a breach an
commence a march on Paris down
the historic poplar lined roads fol
lowing the banks ot the Marne.
Trenches were dug, ammunition in
vast quantities was stored at strate
gic points and everything put In hip
t-hape for springing the big offensive.
Then tho January sun came out.
Rarest of all rarities in France, a
mid-winter dry spell came accompa
nied by lots of spring like days and
sunshine. From January 15 until
past the middle of February one
would have thought May at hand. Tha
"strange atmospheric phenomenon"
had comrt to pass, and the decision to
let fly was the result. According to
German prisoners they had been told
on the eve of the battle:
"Tho artillery Is going to blaze the
way for you. It will do its work so
completely that all you will have to
do will be to march at parade step in
to Verdun."
They were told, they said, that the
fighting would not amount to much
and would all be over in no time.
Judging from what the German sol
diers admit, the Crown Prince's plana
must havo included a swift punch an!
a quick victory, withVerdn and out
lying forts as a mlnlmum,m German
po? session. Otherwise, experts are
agreed, probably he never would hav
