Another determined atack by the

in failure and with heavy losses to the
Germans.
. After days of intense artillery prep
aration for another effort to lessen the
6bc miles intervening between them
and the Paris-Verdun railway and the
nine miles still between them and
Verdun, the Germans launched a great
infantry attack on the Haucourt-Beth-incourt
sector.- In successive waves
the Germans were thrown into the fray
but all of their attempts were put
down by the curtain of fire of the
JjTench guns and volleys of the French
Infantry.
There is still an intermittent bom

SatUTday on its I report.
The attorneys who signed the brief,
which purports to summarize the 1,300
pages of testimony heard by the com
mittee, were Austen Fox and Kenneth
M. Spence of New York.
The standard of professional ethics
which they charge Mr. Brandeis with
having violated is one which fcrbid3

reposed by a client thereafter accept
ing employment from others in matters
adversely affecting any interest of the

FEAR OF BEING FORCED
' INTO WHITE SLAVERY
Caused Bessie Reimers of Cleveland
to' Set Fire to Apartments.
Cleveland, Ohio, March 2S. As a re
sult of the confession of Bessie Rei
mers, 19, waitress, that driven by fear
she would be forced into white Slav
ery, she set fire to the Foster Apart
ments this morning, causing the death
of two .persons and injury to eighteen,
the girl was arrested today on the
charge of manslaughter and arson.
George Hanson, waiter, 25, and
G'eorge Bauman, 26. were also arrested
on the charge of being suspicious per
sons, pending further investigation by
the police.
In her signed confession to Chief of
Detectives. Rabshaw, the girl said she
was driven to desperation by Hanson
snd his associates who, she said, want
ed her to become a white slave. As a
result of a police raid c.n the Foster
Apartments last week, in which she
was innocently involved, she lost her
position as waitress and in her con
fession declared she sought death as a
means of evading Hanson and his
temptation.
The girl admitted, it is said, that
this morning she turned on two gas
jets without lighting them, bound her
ankles anw gagged herself so she
could not make an alarm and then
waited for death. A small stove which
was lighted ignited the gas and start
ed the fatal fire, she said. She was
badly burned about the shoulders be
fore she was rescued.

ENGLISH BOY SCOUTS
ACTING AS PARLOR MAIDS
To Circumvent the Servant Problem
Brought About by the War.
London. March 23. Bov S
been introduced in many Enehsh
homes to take the place of nn rlrvr
maids. This . is one of the aft emnta
made here to circumvent the servant
problem brought about by the war.
Butlers and footmen have discarded
their liveries and donned khaki, while
thousands of young women who used
to earn their living as servants have
gone to serve tne country (and, inci
dentally, to earn better wages) as mu
nition workers. In searching about for
a solution of the problem some ingen
ious housewives hit upon the idea of
employing Boy Scouts, with the result
mat tne practice is becoming popular.
The Boy Scout waits at table, cleans
the silver, and answers the door. He
iooks very smart in his uniform and
his scout training makes him nti effi

M EM BET! OF TENTH CAVALRY

George A.
Hudnell, a Negro Soldier,
the Victim.
Columpus, N. M., March 28. A rail
road wreck in the district south of
uasas uranaes caused the death of the
first soldier in the American punitive
expeditionary command, according to
official despatches received at military
headquarters tonight. A message from
General J. J. Pershing's headquarters
said that George A. Hudnell, a negro
soiaier in xroop ts. Tenth Cavalry,
had been killed in a wreck, but gave
no details. Hudnell left a widow at
Fodt Huachuca, Arizona. The trooper
was given a military Durial March 2H

Troopers of Tenth
Cavalry Injured
ACCIDENT ON MEXICAN
NORTHWESTERN RAILROAD
TEN HURT, THREE" BADLY
Two Cars Rolled Down Embankment
When One of the Raila of a Tempo
rary Track Gave Way.
San Antonio,. Tex., March 28. Con
firmation of reports that General Per
shing already has been using a por
tion of the Mexican .Northwestern
railroad for transportation of troops
was secured by General Funston today
from what was said to be an unofficial
source. This information included a
report of the overturning of two cars
and the injuring of ten troopers of the
.he Tenth cavalry and several horses.
Three of the men were reported serf
ously injured.
Cars Rolled Down Embankment.
The accident occurred while the
cars were being taken over a tem
porary track that had been built
around the Cumbre tunnel south of
Casas Grandes. One of the rails gave
way and the cars rolled down an em
bankn.ent.
It was not believed at headquarters
that General Pershing's use of the
railroad prior to receipt of permission
from the Carranza government would
endanger the negotiations now being
conducted by the state department.
because it was assumed he had gained
permission of those in charge of op
erations of that section of the line.
Pershing's Silence Causes No Uneasi
ness.
No reports from General Pershing
were received today, but his silence
caused no uneasiness at headquarters,
where the chief concern continued to
be the problem of getting supplies into
Mexico without a railroad.
Advices from Washington that the
state department had prepared a
memorandum urging Carranza to de
cide the question of using the railroad
without waiting for the ratification of
the protocol revived the hope that per
haps by Thursday the stores held at
El Paso may be forwarded to , some
field depot more accessible to the
roops now operating almost 300 miles
from the boundary line.
Exactly where Colonel Dodd's cav
alry is now, or into how many detach
ments it has been divided, was un
known at General Funston's headquar
ters today.
Pershing Working Out Problem.
The whereabouts of General Pershing
a so remained unreported, but thl lack
of information created no uneasiness
for General Pershing still has orders
to work -out- M a own problems'. Full
realization of the danger into which
some of the advanced detachments
must be moving was acknowledged.
Vil'a's known ability as a director of
ambuscades has aroused frank expres
sions of fear among army officer? thai
he may catch some of the American
troops in a mountain trap.
Pessimistic About Capture of Villa.
Openly expressed pessimism as to an
early capture of Villa now is frequent
ly heard. Unless checked by the forces
of the de facto government or unless
he himself decides to turn and fight,
there appeared no reason today why
the chase should cease until Villa had
led the Americans through twisting
mountain trails and over waterlers
wastes for another 300 miles and more.
More Automobile Trucks Asked For.
More automobile trucks hr.ve been
asked for by General Funston and
when they are placed in service there
will be a few more than 100 along the
different lines of communicat'on. This
increased number will not solve the
problem of distributing supplies to the
advanced troops, however, since a large
part of the troops -are operating far
away from trails over which the cars
can -be run.
Use of Railroads Desirable.
The shifting lines of the chase Villa
is leading the pursuing Americans has
made more apparent the desirability
of getting permission to use the
-Tuarez-Chihuah.ua line of the National
as well as the Northwestern railway.
but General Funston has refrained
from making any representations on
the subject, preferring not to interject
a possible embarrassing feature in the
negotiations already under way for
the other line.
It was pointed out that supplies
routed through Chihuahua could be
delivered to the advance troops now
wTUi less loss of time and that a line
of communication established along
the National lines could be guarded
with fewer troops than one along the
more circuitous, mountainous route of
"he Northwestern.
If either railroad is used. It Is prob
able that all the troops now extending
from Columbus through Casas Grandes
to the positions' of the advnnced caval
ry will be moved eastward along the
route and that those who then would
be necessary to guard the main line of
communication wili be moved forward
to join in the operations against Villa.

U. S. USING RAILROADS
Official Reports to Washington Dis
close No Change in tha Situation on
the Border or in Mexico.
Washington. March 28. Diplomatic
and domestic aspects of the Mexican
situation overshadowed its military
side here tonight, official reports from
General Funston dislosing no change
in the situation on the border or in
Mexico. Congress rusiod through an
emergency appropriation of $8,611,502,
to pay for the pursuit of the bandits
and the state department prepared to
press General Carranza for permm
sion to use Mexican railways to solve
the troop supply problem.
No Fear Reflected.
Fears expressed In prss reports
from the border that failure to obtain
use of the railroads rnisht heriously
hamper the nuruit ' v;u.i were not
reflected at either the state or war de
partments.
Senator Gallinger. republican leader
in the senate, presented to Secretary
Baker a telegram from Senator Fall
at El Paso dealing with tne railway
and border qestions. It Is declared
shipments of gasoline intended for the
American forces in Mexico were being
held up by Carranza officials.
Growing Good Will in Mexico.
"The department's despatches of last
night and today, while meagre and
dealing with technical maters, indi
cate continued and growing good will
toward our expedition in Mexico
Secretary Baker said later in a state
ment. "Its object arprars to be
thoroughly understood by the people of
Mexico. We have no uespateiies in
dicating any cause for apprehension.'
The communication to General Car
ranza will be made through rpeelal
Representative Kodgcrs at Quorataro.
to whom instructions went forward
tonight. State department ofilc'als
said that it seemed necessary to im
press upon the de facto covernmen
the need for special consideration of
the request for the use of the lines
south from the border without waiting
the perfectins of the protocol under
negotiation. hile there was no ques
tion but that the expedition after VII
la would press on. it was stated, and
that a sufficient amount of supplies
cou'.d be furnished to the troops by
motor trucks, general use of the lines
ould greatly simplify maimers.
American Troops Using Railroads

troops already were using the rail
road lines in some sections were rea

meials declaring there had been no
fflrial advices to that effect. It was
thoucht that If the American com
manders had used the lines in Mtr.
cases on their own initiative it rrob
bly was done in co-opention wit! the
local Carranza authorities. onlrt.-tl
do not think any extensive usa of tail
roads has been made.
No Check in Protocol Negatiations.
There are Indications that the rheek
in the protocol negotiations resulting
f-eni General Carrannn's eou-iter pro-
It.-als may extend that discussion a
week or more.
General Carrenza's swrTestions as to
the details of the protocol aprarentlv
ire causing serious study at the state
department.
What Carranza Wants.
While officials are reti-nt. it Is
understood the most important Hug
gestion deals with the territory to be
embraced within the scope of the
agreement. It Is thought possible
General Carranza desires to set nar
rower limits than had been agreed up
on by the Mexican ambassador desig
nate and the state department in the
original draft. Some officials think the
first chief might be unwilling to have
it disclosed Just how far the Ameri
can forces have penetrated or may
penetrate Into his country to carry out
their mission.
It was indicated that General Car-
ranza's proposals showed no dc-ilro to
exclude the expedition from use of the
Mexican railways. On the contrary,
the protocol would establish a definite
agreement fir Just that purpose. As
this may take some time to reac.i its
final form. Washington omeriis de
termined to press for the mn"h more
limited permission asked for by Gen
eral Funs'on.
Supply Situation Not Serious.
Secretary Baker was emphatic to
day in saying no objection to the use
of motor truck trains to supply the
troops had been raised by Mexican of
ficials. With the $3,000,000 emergency
appropriation available, the depart -

he wanted to make anv statement,
passed one hand over his eves and an.

Oh. It"a all over. He did It. Thl.

VILLA
IS HEADED -'
FOR SAN ANDRES
According to New Brought by Ameri
cans Returning From Mexico.
El Paso. Texas. March 28. Des
patches from the front Interpreted In
connection with news brought by
Americans returning from different
points in the Interior of Chihuahua
caused a belief hero tonight that
Frarrisco Villa was headed for San
Andres, about 23 miles southwest of
Chihuahua City, a favorite head
quarter of the bandit. He is thought
to he already not less than fifty mile
ahead of hl pursuers and possioly
lending the chase a much grea'or dis
ta nre.
There are several Americans In El
P..o who rr not only thoroughly fa
miliar wl h the country through which
Villa Is flawing, but who ware aln
well acquainted with the bandit chief
In former da' s. They are asTeed that
Villa's objective Is the district around
Parral and south from there to Tor
raon. In which territory numerous
Villa bands, under the leadership ot
Canuto Reyes, are operating with con-
iderable success.
If Villa is pble to effect a Junction
with Reyes the problem of his ex
termination will have become a serious
on as ha then will be able to con
trol several thousand soldiers, who.
snllt Into guerilla bands, might be
able to keen up a desultory mountain
warf.-ire for an unlimited period, they
point out.
Tha one hope at present Is that the
American cavalrymen may be able to
catch up with Villa before ha gents
much further south. It Is admitted
here that the hope is a slended one
and will be much more attenuated if
the American troops are not given the
use of the Mexican railroads for
bringing up supplies. The supplier
question overshadows everything else
now. Army officers here say that
upon Its solution depends every chance
of a fntrressful termination to the pur,
suit of the bandit.
