In every part of the, Slope country
the Hoods have wrecked bridges and
in many localities entirely put a stop
to railroad travel. West of this point
on the main line of the Northern Pa
cific, the Knife river has cut through
the banks and tied up traffic. The
Heart river is out of its banks and
the Curlew, Sims and Sweet Briar

toll of bridges.
Mandan Endangered.
The lower part of Mandan Is in
danger of floods and reports from
the Syndicate state that water is
rising and covering certain of the riv­
erside streets.
,Gorges Still Hold.
The gorges of the Missouri still
hold and it is likely when the addi­
tional waters of last Tuesday and
last night's storms are added to the
river, the low lands will be inundat­
ed. The river during the last 24
hours had fallen slightly at Wash­
burn, but huge gorges of ice above
that place, Sanish and Williston are
backing the waters up to an unpre­
cedented extent and when they go out
this section of the Missouri will un­
doubtedly be given such a flood as
only the oldest old-timers in this
section remember.
Stanton Reports.
Tuesday evening, messages from
Stanton stated that the Knife had
risen ten feet and was still rising.
The recent snows having melted, have
so swelled the creeks and other
streams draining into the Knife that
nearly every bridge is expected to go
out.
Streets Filled With Slush.
The past few days have been the
worst known in Bismarck for many
years. The snows which fell last
Tuesday and Friday Have turned to
pulpy mud and slush and make the
work of getting about town extremely
difficult.
MICHIGAN HAS SERIOUS FLOOD.
Detroit, Mich., March 28.—Reassur­
ing reports that cities and towns in
1he flood region of Lower Michigan
were no longer seriously threatened
by high waters, continued to reach
Detroit late today. These reports,
however, increased the toll of damage.
Telegraph, telephone and railroad
companies sustained heavy losses.
Bridges in the Saginaw-Bay and City
Flint districts were swept away.
Saginaw and Flint 'fere the only
important cities which reported ris­
ing rivers. The former cities' low
lying quarters were fftmdateri.
Flint's principal bridge over the
river in the heart of the city was said
to be in danger, as the result of an
ice jam.
Alpena was almost isolated.

to investigate the cracking of jack­

guns on the battleships, Louisiana
and 'Michigan, during target practice
at Guantanamo. When the vessels
return to their home yards next
month, the defective guns will be re­
placed. They had been relined re­

Emigration Bill Seeks to Prevent
Dumping of Unemployed Into
Large Cities.
Washington, March 28.—Any re­
striction imposed by a foreign coun­
try on emigration from the United
States would automatically operate
as a reciprocal restriction upon emi­
gration from that country into the
United States under a provision writ­
ten into the Burnett immigration bill
today by the house. The amendment
was submitted by Representative
Humphreys, who cited specifically a
Canadian order in council, barring
unskilled and skilled laborers from
entering Canada through British Co­
lumbia.
The house failed fo complete de­
bate on the bill as leaders had ex­
pected and discussion will be con­
tinued Thursday. Calendar Wednes­
day will prevent consideration of it
tomorrow, but the house a creed to
meet earlier than usual on Thursday
and a vote will be taken on that day.
In advocating his amendments,
representative Humphreys declared
63 per cent of the applicants for char­
ity in Seattle last winter were for­
eigners, and that the United States
"ought not to permit British Columbia
to make this countrv
a
ground 'for her laborers.''

London, March .28.—Another deter­

through the French lines northwest
of Verdun has resulted in failure and
losses to the Germans. After (Jays
of intense artillery preparation for
another effort to lessen the miles in­

the Germans launched a great artil­

tor. In successive waves the Ger­
mans were thrown into the fray, but
all attempts of the Germans were put
down by the certain fire of the French
infantry. There is still an intermit­

of Verdun and in the Woevre dis­

State Department I? Confronted
With Difficult Situation Over
Sussed Attack.
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE

President Wilson Probably Will
Place Naval Issues Before
Congress.
Washington, March 28.—Secretary
Lansing, with the approval of Presi­
dent Wilson, has instructed Ambassa­
dor Gerard to inquire of Germany
whether any of itsj submarines tor-:
pedoed the British steamer, Sussex,
on which 25 Americans were travel­
ing, or the British horse ship, English­
man, which werit down with the loss
of one American life. As the situa­
tion now stands, the United States
has no conclusive proof that a sub­
marine attacked the ships, but the evi­
dence indicates Hint they were tor­
pedoed without warning. On the re­
sponse of the Berlin foreign office to
Mr. Gerard's inquiry may depend the
next step of the American govern­
ment. At this time, ir is made clear
no action has been taken which in any
sense might be construed as a demand
or a protest.
Make Inquiry.
President Wilson laid all the state
department reports on the subject be­
fore his cabinet today. It was after
the mooting that Secretary Lansing
allowed it to become known that it
had been determined to make an in­
quiry of the German government. Lat­
er it was learned that instructions had
already been forwarded to Ambassa­
dor Gerard. They probably were in
his possession this afternoon.

PROCEEDING AGAINST HIM
UNDER THE MANN ACT
Chicago, March 28.—Ada .V. Cox,
complaining witness in the Mann Act
case against William Rul'us Edwards,
wealthy, lumberman of St. Paul, was
under severe attack today as to her
character up to and including the
time she met Edwards in June, lit 10.
Miss Cox in her testimony yester­
day declared Edwards was her lirst
lover. Today men who said they had
known her at' Rockl'ord, 111., Boston,
Now York, 'Rochester, Madison, Mil­
waukee. and Indianapolis, were called
upon lo refute this testimony.

Chief among them were Wi'.lard S.

tided that she had accompanied hliii

The defendant himself took the
stand and denied many important
statements made by Miss Cox. In ef­
fect, he denied that he practiced any
seduction.
Edwards stated that he deliberately
sought the acquaintance of Miss Cox
to get business secrets of her employ­
er. Her employer was W. E. Mogg of
Chicago. Mogg, Edwards said, took
Miss Cox, and he look a Miss Hallway

Diplomatic and Domestic Aspects
of the Mexican Affair Upper*
most.
WASHINGTON PRESSES FOR
IMMEDIATE AGREEMENT
#asfiington, March 28.—Diplomatic
and domestic aspects of the Mexican
problem overshadoAved the military
situation here tonight. General Funs
ton reported no changes in the situa
tion on the border or in Mexico. Con­
gress rushed through an emergency
appropriation of $8,611,502 to pay for
the pursuit of the bandits, and the
state department prepared to press
General Carranza for permission to
use Mexican railways to solve the
troop supply problem.
Border Rumors.
Border rumors contained in press
reports that failure to obtain use of
the railroads might seriously hamper
the pursuit of Villa were not reflected
at either the state or war depart
ments.
Senator Gallinger, republican lead­
er in the senate, presented to Secre
tary Baker a telegram from Senator
Fall of El Paso, dealing with the rail­
way and border questions. He de­
clared shipments of gasoline intended
for the American forces in Mexico
were being held up by Carranza offi­
cials.
Dispatches Meagre.
"The department's dispatches of
last night and tonight while meagre,
and dealing with technical matters,
indicate continued and growing good
will toward our expedition in Mexico,"
the secretary said later in a state­
ment. "Its object appears to be thor­
oughly understood by the people ol
Mexico. We have no dispatches indi­
cating any cause for apprehension."
The communication to General Car­
ranza will be made through Special
Representative Rogers, at Aqueratero,
to whom instructions went forward
tonight. ~iate department officials
said that it seemed necessary to im­
press upon the de facto government
the need for special consideration of
the request to use the lines south
from the border without' awaiting the
perfecting of the protocol under ne­
gotiation.
Need Railroads.
While there was no question but.
lhat the expedition after Villa would
press on, it was stated that while a
sufficient amount of supplies could be
supplied to the troops by motor truck
trains, general use of the lines would
greatly simplify matters.
News dispatches from the border
tonight indicating that the American
troops already were using the rafl
road lines in some sections were read
with surprise at the war department,
officials declaring there had been no
official advices to that effect. It was
thought that if the American com­
manders had used the lines in some
cases on their own initiative, it was
done with the permission of local Car­
ranza officials.
Press for Understanding.
There are indications that the
check in the protocol negotiations re­
sulting from General Carranza's coun­
ter proposal, may extend that discus­
sion a week or more.
It was indicated that General Car­
ranza's proposals showed no desire to
exclude the expedition from the use of
Mexican railroads. On the contrary,
the protocol would establish a defi­
nite agreement for just that purpose.
As this may take some time to reach
its final form, Washington officials

army officers that he may attack
some of the American troops in a
mountain trap.

•More auto trucks have been asked
by General Funston, and when placed
in service there will be something
like 3(10 in service on the expedition.
The shifting lines of the chase
Villa is leading the pursuing Ameri­
cans has made more apparent the de­
sirability of getting permission to use
the Juarez-Chihuahua line of the Na­

frained from making any representa­
tions on the subject, preferring not
to interject a possible embarrassing
feature in the negotiations already,
under way for the other line.
It was pointd out that supplies
routed through Chihuahua would be
delivered to the advance troops now
