Cleveland, March 29. A
slip on the part of a dozing
tower man was to blame for
the wreck according to A. S.
Ingalls, general superintend
ent of the New York Central.
Ingalls, with L. A. Robinson,
general passenger agent of
the New York Central, and
Daniel McBane, superintend
ent of motive power of the
road, conducted an inquiry
into the tragedy on the part
of the road officials. The
towerman's wife had been ill,
it was learned, and he had
been without sleep and on
duty practically since Sun
day night.
Cleveland. March 29. At least
thirty persons were killed the
exact total may not he known un
til nightfall and more than forty
Injured in the wreck early today
of three of the w York Central's
crack pasciiirer trains a mile
vest of Amherst.
Twentv-five hodies had heen
taken out at noon and rive more
nere known to be in the debris.
When the total of dead and In
jured is tiually ascertained, the
wreck will surpass, in its cost of
life and limb, even the wreck of
the Twentieth Century limited at
Mentor in 15114. when the famous
train piled into a freight on its
second trip on the 'ew York
I'hicairo 20 hour run.
Cleveland, March 29. With 30 man
gled bodies in morgues at Amherst,
37 miles west of Cleveland, and 40
persons seriously injured, some dying,
in a hospital at Elyria, rescue parties
today were working frantically to re
cover more dead and injured from the
wreckage of three of the New York
Central's fastest and finest trains,
which were damaged in a double
wreck at Amherst at 4 o'clock this
morning. Relief trains have been sent
to the scene from Cleveland, Elyria
and other nearby places.
The three trains in the wreck were
two sections of train No. 86, east-
bound Chicago to Buffalo, flier, and
the Twentieth Century Limited, pride
of the New York Central.
The first body taken from the wreck
age to bo identified was that of Rev.
Gustav Walyi, pastor of the First Hun
garian Evangelical Lutheran church,
Detroit. Rev. Walyi lived at No. 53
Thaddeus street, Detroit.
The second section of the Chicago
Buffalo flier crashed into the first sec
tion in a heavy fog when the first sec
tion stopped to take water.
Most of Dead Foreigners.
Most of the dead are said to be for
eigners, who were traveling in the
rear coach of the first section of the
Chicago-Buffalo flier.
There are no dead among the pas
sengers on the Twentieth Century
Limited, though a number of passen
gers were badly hurt on this train.
Two coaches of the Twentieth Cen
tury were overturned. The low cas
ualties on the Twentieth Century are
attributed to the fact that the palace
train was proceeding slowly because
of the heavy fog.
The second section of the flier was
going at a high rate of speed when it
"ruck the first section.
Many of the dead probably will go
to their graves unidentified.
Most of those killed were asleep In
the rear day coach of first train No.
at the time of the crash and they
had removed wraps and coats and
"ther articles of identifying clothing.
The bodies of many of these scant
ily clad victims are so horribly man
gled that identification, without the
guidance of the clothing they wore,
H1 be impossible.
Bodies Badly Mutilated.
Some of the victims were decapi

Police Seek
Etnbalmer in
Dual Murder
Xew York, March 29. Detectives
from the district attorney's office went
to Orient Point, L. I., early today in
search of Eugene O. Kane, an embalm
er, who for the time being is the
most important witness in the Peck
murder case. Dr. Arthur Warren
Waite, in the latest chapter of his ser
ial confession, told the district attor
ney that he had given Kane $9,000 to
swear, if necessary, that he had used
arsenic in embalming the body of John
E. Peck for burial. The use of arsen
ic In embalming fluid is against the
law in New York state and Kane, sev
eral days ago was accused of saying
no arsenic was used in embalming
Mr. Peck's body. The young dentist's
confession hate convinced the district
attorney that he is getting ready to de
fend himself on a plea of insanity.
Medical experts have informed the
district attorney that there is nothing
surprising about Waite's failure to ob
tain results from feeding deadly
germs to Mr. and Mrs. Peck. It often
happens, they say, that persons have
such a strong natural immunity
against disease that the bacilli attack
them in vain. In any event, it is said,
the effect of germs administered in
this way would be slow.

Washington, March 29. Plans for
continuing the fight for national wom

TROOPERS IN
VILLA CHASE
HOT ON TRAIL
American Cavalry, Under
Difficulties, Pressing on
After Bandit.
MEXICANS LOSE OUT
Carranza Forces Said to
Have Lost All Trace of
Quarry in Hunt.
Washington, March 29.
General Carranza has agreed
to permit the movement of
supplies to the punitive ex
pedition in Mexico over the
Mexican-Northwestern rail
road. The supplies will go
as commercial freight to con
cerns in Mexico with which
the army has contracts.
The permission for use of
the railroad is not granted in
a military sense and does not
cover the movement of
troops for which the Ameri
can army has not asked. It
will, however, enable Gen
eral Pershing's force to get
supplies in abundance in a
country where motor truck
trains cannot carry them and
will thus aid immeasurably
in the pursuit of the Villa
bandits.
El Paso, March 29 The chase of
the brigand Villa by the flying col
umns of American cavalry goes re
lentlessly on but from the meager
ness of the official dispatches from
General Pershing's advanced base it
was impossible to learn today the po
sition of the American troops and
how far they were in the rear of the
fleeing band. Villa was last heard of
heading southward toward the Tara
humare mountain country, his com
mand driving their Mexican ponies at
full speed and being closely pressed
by the American troopers.
Commanders of the Carranza troops
now in the Chihuahua region appar
ently have lost trace of Villa and his
men for no report has been received
by Mexican officials here for some
time concerning Villa's whereabouts.
Armed bands of Villa forces are re
ported in various parts of Chihuahua
and in some numbers around Torreon,
but they are operating independently
of the main Villa command.
Try to Establish Base.
Carranza officials in Juarez express
their belief that Villa will try to es
tablish a main base at some point
after he has thrown the American
cavalry off his trail and then recruit
his command.
Villa, the Carranza officers think,
will then engage in a marauding cam
paign that would give the American
and Carranza forces no end of
trouble.
Army officers here do not believe
Villa will ever make a stand and
fight the American cavalry but will
continue in flight until he escapes or
is cornered.
Somewhere among the grim and ex
tinct volcanoes of the great conti
nental divide, Pancho Villa is fleeing
southward today. Hard on his trail,
the cavalrymen of the United States
army are straining every nerve to
catch up with him before he can reach
the wastes, almost unknown to any
but Mexicans and Indians, in which
be began his career as a bandit years
ago.
Tilla (hase Fnfflel
An American rancher, one of the
few foreigners familiar with the coun
try through which Villa is retreating
said:
"Villa and his men, mounted on
their Mexican ponies, can travel 40
miles a day with ease and 50 miles if
pressed. All his men need is a little
dried beef and some cornmeal," said
this American. "With this and a
blanket strapped behind their saddles
they can travel indefinitely. Compare
this with the equipment of an Ameri
can trooper who makes 35 miles a
day at best."
The rancher was asked what dif
ference he thought the introduction
of aeroplanes in the chase was going
to make.
;l hardly think they will prove of
any great assistance," he 6aid. "In
the first place the aviators will be
starting from an altitude of 8,000 to

Paris Tells of Aerial Attack
by Enemy on City at

Paris, March 29, (2:25 p. m.)
Twenty persons were killed and be
tween thirty and forty were wounded
and two German aeroplanes were de
stroyed in the aerial raid over Salonlki
on Monday, says an official statement
issued here this afternoon.
The statement follows:
"A squadron of seven German aero
planes attempted to make a raid on
Saloniki Monday. Their purpose was
to reach the warships anchored in the
harbor but they , were obliged to give
this up by the fire of the French artil
lery. "Pursued by French aviators two of
the German aeroplanes were destroyed.
"Bombs thrown down by the Ger
man aviators caused the death of 20
persons and brought wounds to 30 or
40 others."
CHINA CIVIL WAR
SEEMS PROBABLE
San Francisco, March 29. Two
. more districts in Kwanirtiing prov
ince have joined the revolution
against Yuan Shi Kai, two mili
tary stations have been occupied
by the revolutionists and a third
station, all in Kwangtunfr prov
ince, has declared its independ
ence of Yuan Shi Kai, according
to a cablegram received today by
the Chinese association from
Shanghai.
Washington, March 29. Should
President Yuan Shi Kai and the reb
el Chinese governors who have de
manded his immediate retirement fall
to come to terms, officials here be
lieve the result would be a long and
destructive civil war in China. It is
known that Yuan is surrounded with
large military forces and the stand
ards would probably be loyal to him
so long as he was willing to draw up
on his large sources of revenue for
their pay. So far, neither the state
department nor the Chinese legation
has received any official advices con
cerning the events in Peking since
Yuan's mandate renouncing the
throne. Press reports from Shanghai
that Tang Shao Yi, the first premier
of the republic had urged the presi
dent to relinquish his office to Vice
President Li Yuen Heng, have been
read with interest, however, and some
officials think Yuan will be inclined
to heed advice from Buch a source.

FRENCH TAKE
GROUND LOST
TO GERMANS
Claim Night Attack on Avo
court Wood West of the
Meuse Is Success.
Paris, March 29, (12:15 p. m.)
French troops made an attack last
night on Avocourt wood, west of the
Meuse, where the German assault was
made yesterday. The official statement
today says the French carried part of
the works which the Germans had
constructed. The Germans made a
fierce counter attack but were driven
back with heavy losses. They made
no other effort to recover the lost
ground.
The ' recent German attack upon
Malancourt was made with a fresh di
vision, which was thrown back with
large loss.
The communication follows:
"In the Argonne district our bat
teries have bombarded the positions
of the Germans north of Haute-Che-vauchee
and on the southern boundary
of the wood of Cheppee. A fight with
hand grenades, made in conjunction
with activity in the next sector, made
it possible for us to make progress,
particularly in the connecting trenches
of the enemy to the north of Avocourt.
"This morning after an intense prep
aratory artillery fire, our troops deliv
ered a spirited attack against the Ger
man positions in the wood of Avo
court. We occupied the southeastern
corner of this wood for a depth of
more than three hundred yards, as
well as an important work called the
redoubt of Avocourt which the Ger
mans had strongly fortified. A violent
and sudden counter attack delivered
by the enemy with a fresh brigade
which had arrived on the scene but a
few days ago, was completely repulsed
by us. The enemy suffered heavy losses
and left 50 prisoners in our hands.
"To the east of the river Meuse
there has been great activity on the
part of the opposing artillery forces
in the region of Vaux and Douaumont
and in the Woevre, in the sector of
Moulainville."
Berlin, March 29, (via London, 3:48
p. m.) French positions north of Ma
lancourt sever lines deep along a
front of 2,000 metres have been storm
ed by German troops, the German
headquarters staff announced today.
The statement follows:
"Eastern front: The Russians con
tinued during the day and night their
fruitless efforts south of N'arocz lake.
On seven occasions our troops repuls
ed the enemy, sometimes at the point
of bayonets.
"On the left bank of the Meuse our
troops, with little loss to themselves,
stormed French positions north of
Malancourt over a front of about 2.000
metres. They also penetrated the
northwestern portion of Malancourt
The French left in our hands 12 offi
cers and 4S6 un wounded men, one
gun and four machine guns."

BRITISH SHIP
WAS WARNED
SAYS REPORT
Affidavits of American Sur
vivors State Vessel
Tried to EscaDa.
ASK ABOUT SUSSEX
Germany Questioned as to
Whether Craft Caused
That Disaster.
Washington, March 29. The British
horseship Englishman was first shelled
and then torpedoed by a German sub
marine, according to affidavits made to
representatives of the state depart
ment at Liverpool by three American
survivors.
Following the receipt of this Infor
mation today officials said it seemed
clear that the Englishman had tried to
escape. The submarine was operat
ing within the law in shelling and tor
pedoing the Englishman if the vessel
was fleeing to escape capture as is in
ferred by officials here from the dis
patch. Inunire at Berlin.
The German government has been
asked whether any of Its submarines
were concerned In the sinking of the
Englishman or the damaging of the
British channel steamer Sussex while
that ship was carrying twenty-five
American passengers.
While it is indicated that the case of
the Englishman may not lead to dif
ficulties between the United States and
Germany if it Is proved she was escap
ing, overnight dispatches to the state
department from Dover seem, officials
said, to bear out previous allegations
that the Sussex was torpedoed. Amer
ican consul representatives. It was
said in the dispatches, ' had secured
from various survivors at Dover affi
davits confirming those by survivors
in France.
Expect German Reply.
The state department expected to re
ceive from Ambassador Gerard some
time today or tonight the result of his
inquiry to the German foreign office,
upon the damaging of the Sussex and
the sinking of the Englishman. Upon
the information contained in the am
bassador's reply, probably will depend
the next step to be taken by the United
States.
A dispatch from Dover today said
George II. Crocker, an American, Is
seriously injured. Information re
ceived by the state department does
not disclose whether the Englishman
was torpedoed before or after she had
stopped. The reports Indicate that she
had made an attempt to escape but
apparently had abandoned the attempt
and was coming to a standstill when
torpedoed.
President Wilson discussed the sub
marine issue at length with Colonel E.
M. House. Councellor Polk of the
state department also saw Colonel
House.
