Death of aRIftffroman.
Mrs. Dellie Bryant, who was the be
loved wife of T. J. Bryant, 'who is a
merchant, doing business near Ozark,
died last Wednesday morning at 2
o'clock. She was sixty-five years old,
and had been an invalid for eleven
years, being a victim of pulmonary
trouble. She was tenderly cared, for
during her Jong affliction by her de
voted husband and loving children.
Neighbors were also constantly at her
bedside, and the best medical at.ten
tion was employed.
The deceased was a very religious
woman, having been a devout member
of the Christian Church for many
years.
The funeral services were conducted
by Revs. Nathan Murrell and P. M.
Bryant, a large circle of relatives and
friends being present to pay their last
respects to the departed, who will be
greatly missed, not only by the surviv

May the blessings of God rest upon
those who have been so sorely bereft,
and give them fortitude to sustain
their great loss, a devoted wife and a
loving mother.
She cannot come back, but they can
go to her if they walk in the straight
and narrow path that leads to eternal
life. To meet wife and mother at the

to accomplish.

Motion Pic-
This picture will be given at the
Parlor Circle Wednesday night, April
5th.
Under directions of Head Consul, A.
R. Talbot, of Lincoln, Neb., the Mod
ern Woodmen of America, Is now book
ing a reel of 1,040 feet of motion pic
tures, entitled "The Man Who Came
Back," featuring Robert Wilson, of
Missouri, in a true and realistic film
story of his part in the present war
not of bloodshed but in the fight
against and conquest of that me
nacing monster of the human flesh
tuberculosis. Wilson is one of the
million members 'of the Modern Wood
men of America. Discovering that
he is afflicted with this disease, he
takes advantage of the comforts, care,
an,d cure of the Sanatorium owned,
maintained, and operated by that So
ciety, free of charge to its members.
For several years that fraternal insti
tution has thus actively and effective
ly co-operated in the world-wide move
ment advocated by the Red Cross and
medical authorities, to stamp out the
dread "white plague" and Wilson is
the beneticiary of this Wo5dmen life
saving station. It is an intensely in
teresting and heart-gripping, story of
the leave-taking of wife and children
Weak in body and hopeless in mind he
journeys to the beautiful Rocky Moun
tain region near Colorado Springs,
Colo , where, in the rarified climate
and constant sunshine, at an altitude
of 7,000 feet, he is destined to spend
nine months at the foot of Mount
Cedar, in the care of the most modern
Sanatorium in the world. -His exper
iences in "chasing the cure," his ab
solute rest from all cares and labor,
his gradual return to health and
strength, his "hikes" among the fra
grant pines and over the rocky trails
of the U. S. forest rgserve, leased by
and adjoining the Sanatorium, result
in his final return to family and -friends
victorious over his- foe. "The Man
Who Came Back" is a thrilling and
dramatic story and absolutely true
as well; indeed, his experiences has
been duplicated by nearly 2,000 of his
fellow Neighbors, who have already
enjoyed the benefits of this justly cele
brated institution. This film is pro
nounced by competent authorities to
be one of the very best in. tbis highly
developed age of motion pictures, and
is in such great demand that it can be
booked for only one day and night in
each town or dty. it is a rare op
portunity one can not afford to miss.
State Deputy, for the Modern Wood
men, J W. DeHart, of Louisville, will
be present and give a lecture while the
