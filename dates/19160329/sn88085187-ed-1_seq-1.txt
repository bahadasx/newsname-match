PETERS DISCLOSES HOW
HE BROKE INTO TEN"
AND BECAME A "FISH"
Reporter Peters, as a convict, after be had been admitted i o Walla Walla prison m.l was on
his way to the prison hospital for medical examination. Peters is shown in the "fish clothes" or
preliminary prison garb, which h«' worn the first day in Wnllii W alia. The picture was specially
|n>scd on ' Monday, by permission of Warden llriim, alter il bad been discovered that "Peter \\ ll
sini, former," was a reporter studying prison conditions.
By E. A. Peters
It was more than HO years ago.
A newly arrived prisoner at
the vyulla Walla penitentiary had
just '>een stripped, bathed, at
tired in convict clothing and
placed in a little cell to await
further examination.
A trusty convict slipped si
lently to his cell door.
"What're you In for. bo?' he
whispered, between lips that
moved so imperceptibly no (Hard
could have detected the motion.
"Oh, I robbed a man and didn'i
have sense enough to get p.way,"
replied the dejected newcomer.
"Well, you sure were a sucker
to get caught," was the convict's
pessimistic reply.
"Yep, i was a fish—a poor
"fiah" came from the dark cell.
For three days I w«s a "fish."
Xot because I wa» a "sucker to
get caught." But simply liecause
I was a prisoner in a penitentiary.
MMt slnee thai day when the
uiri-ii prisoner railed himself a
"fish," Wnlla Walla prison has
adopted and matured the phrase.
Kvery new convict is a fish.
The special cells In which new
prisoners me confined are called
"fish cells."
The clothe* worn by « new in
mate are "fish clothes."
.1 convict remains a fish until
lie has pn-M-d medical exainlni*
tlon and then accepted as a "reff
ul»tr prisoner."
Thn prisoners think no more
of culling one of their trilie n
filth, in all deeu seriousness, than
a MfMa on the outside iliiitk* of
i :flint an uiitu-biis a "jit."
The "fish" is an established
lent tire of the |icnitentiary.

been punished for one of the
many misdeeds which wocipty
considers to warrant imprison

It is Hiiid that 1 am the first
reporter who ever obtained a real
"story" of the "inside" at Walla
Walla.
But aside from that feat, im
portant or not, 1 have seen life
from tile Inside in such a manner
that I may be able to give the
public a new insight into the
minds of the so-called criminal
class.

meant lo give the prisoner a onc
year term, com in it ted as great an
injustice, not only to the man,
I but to society, as the prisoner had
committed.
Punishment of crimp no doubt
Is necessary. Penitentiaries per
haps are necessary.
But imprisonment is a terrible
punishment. The mere depriva
tion of a man's liberty, regardless
of any other indignities which he
may suffer in prison, is the bit
terest penalty t lint any man can
pay for hig wrongs.
Reformers of men will never
succeed so long as judges con
tinue to give long sentences for
comparatively trivial offenses.

ceiiainly an enviable record.
McGregor tells me that without any question he can save $20,000 a year in
the conduct of the department if he is elected.
Furthermore he would VOTE RIGHT. We have called attention repeated
ly to the fact that Owen Woods practically always votes wrong, especially on
franchise matters and moral questions. Well, here in McGregor is a candi
date who would run his department better than Woods is doing, and who
would be a good legislator as well.
Clark is of nnnewlial lesser calibre, His business ability is not Ihe equal
of McGregor's. Furthermore, he is a pronounced standpatter and the .Jimmy.

The moral is plain. Vote for McGregor. Gronen is 1 good man; Clark is
a good nuui; there are other good men in the race, liiut don't divide up the vot

A small bale of letters on the subject came in.
One or two writers defended Owen Woods. A eon
siderahle number of letters showing a marked simi
larity of authorship eluded us for not including tin;
name of li. V. Stayton in the lisl of eligibles. Clark
and (ironcii rniiie in [<>)■ praise. And then there was
the stack from MrUregor'a friends.
We have read them all. From the information
and suggestions they contained and from additional
research the men who make The Times have been
conducting, we have reached a definite conclusion -
THAT H. J. McGREGOR IS THE MAN TO VOTE
