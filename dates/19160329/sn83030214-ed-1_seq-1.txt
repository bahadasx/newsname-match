Grand Kapids, Mich., March 28.?That her husband never told her
of an evil personality nor so much as hinted at a "man from Egypt,"
was the declaration of Mrs. Clara Louise Peck Waite to night.
?f "He said no word to m<* about such a condition." she said. "This
evil personality has been conjured up since his arrest, and the man
from Egypt is a rank myth."
Mrs. Waite made her statement through the Rev. Alfred W.
Wishart, who caused Waite's arrest.
"This is Arthur's attempt to free himself, but I will neve*- help
him in it He murdered my mother. I know he did it intentionally.
He had planned it all and he made his plans when he was in posses?
