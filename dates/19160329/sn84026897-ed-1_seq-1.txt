It will be the policy of the leagu
to conserve the prohibition senti
ment throughout the state and fr
aid in building up sentiment fo
law enforcement. .
The executive officer of th?
league is Mr. J. K. Breedin,. th?
superintendent, and all correspond
?anee will be handled by him fron
his office in Columbia. Mr. Breedii
will be available for work in con
nection with the league in all parti
of the state and will be glad to hole
meetings where sentiment for la*
enforcement needs to be improved
and in organizing communities foi
the enforcement of law. .
There is no political inotivt
prompting the Anti-Saloon . League
in its activities, the league regard
ing prohibition as a settled policy
of s'ocial and economic betterment
of the state rather than as a mattel
of politics.
The league invites the co-opera
tion of all patriotic cioizens in its
efforts to promot* the eau9e 'of t?nv
perance and solicits the. aotiv.e and
liberal support of all citizens in all
phases Of 'its work.
Problems of the Rural Church.
. Neither p'overty nor prosperity
should seriously interfere with the
influence and power of the country
church. But it seems that both pros
perity and Ure lack of it do in some
instances prevent rural . churches
from becoming greater factors for
the uplift of humanity. Great pros
perity should not cause many farm
ers to move to town and leave the
rural church, the public school,
roads and neighborhood leadership
to less able and less interested, men,
but it does in many instances. Short
crops and p:>or markets should liol
cause the church to be neglected and
its influence.circumscribed, but such
seems to be the fact.
The rural ?hn-roh is dependent
very largely upon the faithful, self
sacrificing members that love their
neighborhood and are willing to do
their part in helping spread the
gospel among men. Wealth is not a
standard by which to test the coun
try church, as little cash except the
small salary of the pastor is re
quired. The most useful church is
the church that meets its opportuni
ty at home among the young peo
ple of the neighborhood rather, than
to divide "its time and opportunity
"in the foreign field." Few country
churches have advanced far beyond
the *'begin-at-Jerusalem" command
for evangelizing the world. In fact,
.the greatest need of the country
church and Christian people in ru
ral communities is to enlist young
people, train them for service as ru
ral leaders and help them become
more efficient producers as well as
Christian citizens. . This can best be
accomplished by resident pastors
who understand agriculture and ru
ral life, supported and assisted by
the church members,-Farm and
Randi. . . ? . ; ; . ; .

Mrs. J. C. Whitlock
111.
The citizens of our community
will see the close of this day with
feelings of great relief and satisfac
tion, for then will be finished the
last work needed to complete the
claying of the Augusta Highway
to the Aiken county line. This is
indeed a great work, and much
cr?ditas due to those who have so
faithfully united to bring it about.
Nor is4Jie appreciation of this im
provement confined to this neigh
borhood The greater amount of
travel over this road now as com
pared with that before the work was
done is truly surprising. The whole
upper pirt of South Carolina must
be coming through here now going
to Augusta, for automobiles are
passing-not only every hour or so,
but often every few minutes. On
yesterday (Sunday) a young man
sitting on a porch counted fifty that
passed'in Jess than an hour. An
other family counted three hundred
that pas?B0 during the day. So it
does not seem nearly so lonely down
in this country. The world seems
to be coming to us, or , at least is
passing very near by us.
This one change may bring new
life into this country, and for one
thing it has started a new pulse
beat of hope and progress in old
Mt. Zion "church. For some time
time members have been talking
about bringing the old church out
on the "road.'' Yesterday 3t our
regular neting the matter was
laid formally before the church, and
is now under consideration. One
of the members . has. offered a beau
tiful site fyr- .thc church, right on
the new highway. This land bears
some majesjic oaks,, and .is near-a
large and^it?ioiously cold Bpring. .
So now?jpp^noer9 think pf 'ac-'
cepting t?Ur^rift, and'bringing.the
old'-'eburcb, remodeled rind rebuilt
o'ut from' its seclusion. As.it is,
its .light has .long been hidden, if
hot under'a bushel, at least in a
lonely black-jack wood. v ,
Weare sorry to report the s?f?
rious illness of Mrs. J.. C. Whit
lock, .who tor two w.e?iki . has been'
suffering greatly from * large ab
cess on the side ot' hep throat... . A
week' ago "her condition became
critical since wh?n'her son, Dr. Al
bert Whitlock, froril Kit'ehing Mill,
with a'-trailed nurse, .having been
constantly at her bed-side. Another,
physician son, Dr. Giraud Whit
lock, has also., been 'with her, and
lasjkweelt they called in Dr. Harry
.Wyman, fro tn Ai ken,-for surgical
aid.Ou-yerterdayMrs Whitlock seem
ed to be belter, and our commupi
ty'is hoping'that the danger is now
over, aud that this -beloved lady
will soon be free from her suffering,
aud restored to her usual health.

Rock school,"taught by Misses Geor

Our shcool, is on the average in
equipments, but not in structure.
Our Building .is no credit to the

that pur buildings give us a very
poor rating. - . ,
The farmers are actively at work
gotting ready to plant corn. They
are using very little guano in our
settlement.
The'past warm days the gardens
have,been given much'attention. A
garden isa very essential ?bing with
country people.'? trust.that the.fruit
has not been.injured by. the co^d,
although the thermometer, has drop
ped below thirty several times this

Our young people seem to be en
joying the game of rook although it
it is not* new.

thousands of visitors who will be

was held in order to perfect plans
for the Southern's part in efficient
ly moving this large body of peo
ple into and out of Birmingham
within the short space of three days.
Special temporary faciIitips and am
ple police protection will be provid
ed, and a larne number of expert
passenger men will be on hand to
assist the veterans and their friends
in making arrangements for return
trip, while special operating and
mechanical forces will be detailed
to assure the prompt movement of
trains.
Meetings of this character are al
ways held by the Southern in ad
vance of large occasions 'so that*no
feature can be overlooked in mov
ing the extra traffic it is called up
on'to handle, and for the Birming
ham re:union of the veterans there
will be brought to the. service of
the visitors the lull benefit of the
experience gained in- handling the
crowds on.other similar occasions..

JOHN LAKE WRITES
Edgefield's Missionary in China
Writes Interesting Letter
to Dr. E. Pendleton
Jones.
My Dear Pastor:- Your letter,
sent to Seattle, and forwarded to
me in Canton was finally received
and appreciated, thought was sorry
not to have received il while in
Seattle, where I greatly enjoyed a
renewal of fellowship with that dear
brother of yours. He and his great
church showed infinite kindness and
thoughtfulness to my wile and roe,
letting us hide out and rest before
calling on us for mission talks.
After that strenuous year's work
for the Judson Centennial, my
throat and nerves were about worn
out, but when we sailed for our field
of labor again we felt well and
strong and so we a re to-day, after a
busy, busy fall or winter, thus far,
during which time we have spent
much time itinerating. This being
Chinese new year time, we have a
brief respite from that, and wife
and I are catohing up with long
neglected correspondence, and dar
ing the past week, I have written
several long promised letters to the
home papers. I have also began
translating into Chinese your broth
er's sermon before the convention at
Los Angeles..
As dear old Edgefield has so re
cently, passed through the ordeal of
i church tire,. you , and the good
people will , be glad to know how
jne of our. churches and one of
their ohufcbes. peculiarly Edgefield's
3wn, has-been preserved from that
iwful calamity.'"'I'know that you
ind* the mernb?rs of the dear old
home church will rejoice' with ns,

thousand people. On a little Island
called Shaaxeen, a little above Ho
nan, about>?half a mile, long, but
not .nearly?so*j?!ide,-live most of the
Euuopwarw'irt Cantori.' On that little

strange to say, on Honan no
church ur preaching hall, no school
for boys and only one school for
girls. For years Miss Wbilden look
ed, after this school, but* as there
waa no organized work to which to
relate it, we can trace comparative
ly little from it in the way of defi
nite results in the work, of church
planting or church development.
Strange to say, also, our friends of
other denominations bad to a large
