Worth Careful Thought
Do you read the label to know whether
your baking powder is made from cream
of tartar or, on the other hand, from alum
or phosphate ?
Royal Baking Powder is made from
cream of tartar, derived from grapes, and
adds to the food only wholesome qualities.
Other baking powders contain alum or
phosphate, both of mineral origin, and
used as substitutes for cream of tartar
because of their cheapness.
Never sacrifice quality and healthful,
ness for low price.
