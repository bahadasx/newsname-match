STATE MAY NOT GET ISLES.
Interior Secretary Proposes to Make
Sinvey and Sell Some Islands
for Resorts.
Minnesota bids fair to be cheated
out of a donation bv the Federal
government of all unsurveyed is
lands. Some years ago such islands
in Wisconsin were given to the state
by the government. In the attempt
to obtain similar action for Minne
sota the forest service had Senator
Knute Nelson introduce .a bill pro
viding for the giving of the islands
to Minnesota.
Information received today by C.
C. Andrews, secretary of the fores
try board from Senator Nelson is
that Franklin K. Lane, Secretary of
the Interior, proposes an amendment
to the bill which would provide that
all the islands for summer resorts be
sold to individuals and the remainder
sold to the state for $1.25 an acre.
PEACE CLAIMED
TO BE IN SIGHT.
Wellington, D. C, March 28.A
Washington dispatch says:
"Verdun will not fall. The day bemorning.
fore it is to fall, th first steps to
ward peace will be taken. Peace,
when it comes, will come as sudden
ly as the Avar started. This is the
meaning of the gathering of officials
of highest degree at Paris, from
Fi^prlund Ryssi-" Tfol',
France No student of European af
fairs and of this war can place any
othei interpretation on the great
meeting."
Th"s succinct statement came as
the result of an attempt to ascprtain
from the best authorities available
here the German view of the meeting
of the political and military leaders
of th^ allies, which began at Paris
Monday. The speaker was not the
German ambassador, but one who
has access to practically equal
formation as far as Germany
her point of view is concerned.
Stocks Take Drop.
"When Ribot, French minister of
finance 10 days ago stated in ap
proximate terms that the hour for
peace draws near, the stocks of the
'war babies' on the exchange in New
York took a sudden and decided
drop. That was the first intimation
the world had received of the possi
ble sudden end of hostilities. This
meeting called at Paris is the next.
The reason for it is to us plain, for
we know that unlesa peace comes,
Verdun must fall. And if permitted
to fall, the gateway into the level
plains beyond is opened and where,
then, is France? where, then, will
be the millions of British piled up in
100 parallel trenches on a 40-mile
front from Calais as far back as
Boulogne and subject to flank at
tack?
Saturday pi esident of Northwestern College,
Warren, i Feigu Falls, Minn., has kindly con
a large i sented to deliver the commencement
and quite a few hogs were disposed monson is a fine speaker and we re

LIGHT SOWING BEST
IN COOL CLIMATE.
Light seedings have given good re
sults at the Northwest Demonstra
tion Farm and Station at Duluth. M.
J. Thompson, superintendent of the
station, suggests two bushels of oats
to an acre, six pecks of barley, and
six pecks of rye. These, he says,
should be sown with drills. In this
cool climate the plants stool freely,
making it possible to use a minimum
amount of seed.

With Large Deficit.
When the next legislature meets
the members will be confronted with
claims totaling nearly $75,00fr fro

WARREN, MARSHALL COUNTY, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, MARSH 29, 1916
CORN OF 100 PER CENT
GERMINATION RAISED HERE.'
The Spaulding farm has just made
a geimination test of some seed corn
of the Northwestern Dent variety,
raised on the farm last year, and thecousin
resulf
showed a germination of 100
per cent. The field of corn that this
was gathered from got ripe and
made over 50 bushels to the acre.
It is a well known fact that Northern
Minnesota is becoming a corn coun
tiy, and we believe that it will not
be many years until each farm will
have its corn crib, the same as the
states farther south.
We have seen a great deal in the
farm papers this winter about the
scaicity of seed corn all over the
country and the low germination test
of what was offered for sale. In
fact most of the corn in the great
corn growing states was nipped by
the early frost last fall. The fact
that here in Marshall county fully
matured corn was grown, and in ad
dition to that, corn shows 100 per
cent germination by actual soil
tests the nearest approach to natural
conditions will be a revelation to
many who have not considered this
a corn country. At a not distant
day corn is bound to become one of
the staple crops of the Red River
Valley farmer.
