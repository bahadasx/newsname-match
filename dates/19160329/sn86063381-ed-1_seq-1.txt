WOLFBOUNTYCLAIMS
AMOUNT TO $75,000
Next Legislature Will Be
fronted With a Large
Deficit.
Con-
When the next legislature meets
the members will be confronted with
claims totaling nearly $75,000 for
unpaid wolf bounties now being pre
pared by the various counties of the
state. There is already on file in the
office of the state auditor claims
amounting to more than $35,000.
Bounties of $7.50 are paid for grown
wolves and $3 for cubs.
The last legisatlure appropriated
only $10,000 for 1915 and this
amount was in a short time exhaust
ed. When the money became avail
able claims entailing over $21,000
had piled up, but Attorney General
Smith, in a ruling, held that the
money could not be used to clean up
a deficiency. Since then no money
has been paid out.
In Beltrami county alone the wolf
claims amount to $4,858 today.
These are being held by the county
auditor pending the meeting of the
legislature and the appropriation of
sufficient money to meet the de
mand.
For Final Settlement.
Washington, March 29.It was
conceded here that the present Sussex
and Englishman negotiations are to
force a final settlement of the entire
submarine question, including the
Lusitania and all other cases.

HOLDING UP SUPPLIES
Senator Says Gasoline Shipments are
Stopped Order Not
Understood.
Washington, March 28.The dip
lomatic and domestic aspect of the
Mexican problem overshadowed the
military side here yesterday. Official
reports from General Funston in
cluded no change in the situation on
the border or in Mexico. Congress
went through an emergency appro
priation of $8,611,502 to pay for the
pursuit of the bandits and the state
department prepared to press General
Carranza for permission to use the
Mexican railroads to solve the troop
supply problem.
Border rumors contained in such
reports that failure to obtain use of
the railroad might seriously hamper
the pursuit of Villa, were not re
flected at either the state or war de
partment.
Gasoline Held Up.
Senator Gallinger, the republican
leader in the senate, presented to
Secretary Baker a telegram from
Senator Fall of El Paso, dealing with
the railway and border question. He
declared shipments of gasoline in
tended for the American forces in
Mexico were being held up by Car
ranza officials.
Communication Sent.
The communication to General Car
ranza will be made through Special
Representative Rogers at Aquera
tero,*to whom instruction went for
ward today. State department offi
cials said that it was deemed neces
sary to impress upon the de facto
government the need for special con
sideration of the request to use the
line south from the border without
awaiting the perfecting of the pro
tocol under negotiation.
While there was no question but
that the expedition after Villa would
press on, and it was stated that a
sufficient amount of supplies could be
supplied to the troops by motor truck
trains, general use of the lines would
greatly simplify matters.

KINDERGARTEN TO
OPEN IN BEMIDJI
Board of Education Authorizes Super
intendent Dyer to Secure
Instructor.
At a meeting of the board of edu
cation last evening it was decided
to open a kindergartern in Bemidji
and Superintendent Dyer was auth
orized to secure an instructor.
The kindergarten will open the
week after the school vacation and
will remain open for three months,
running during the month of June.
Prof. B. M. Gile submitted a re
port at the meeting, showing that
$38.03 profit had been made at the
school farm in chicken raising.
The board discussed the plan of
having an instructor next year who
is competent in both drawing and
music. The schools have no drawing
teacher this year but have-a music
teacher. Two years ago the schools
had both a drawing and music teach
er. It is believed by the board that
one instructor can handle both sub
jects.

a meeting yesterday decided to drop
the matter of a banquet for the
e'erks and instead give a picnic.
The picnic will be held in July or
August and committees have been
named to arrange plans.
At the meeting yesterday the fol
lowing committee was named to have

GREAT BRITAIN HAS

blizzard in the recollection of the

communication is too disorganized

GENERAL PERSHING
USING RAILROADS,
SAYS FUNSTON
United States Expedition Leader
Takes Over Northwestern
Railway.
CARRANZA HAS NOT
GIVEN PERMISSION
Note is Sent to De Facto Government
Explaining Need of
Roads.
San Antonio, March 29.General
Funston today confirmed the United
Press exclusive dispatches of a week
ago stating that General Pershing is
using a portion of the Mexico North
western line.
It was not believed at headquarters
that General Pershing's use of the
railroad prior to receipt of permis
sion from the Carranza government
would endanger the negotiations now
being conducted by the state depart
ment, because it was assumed he had
gained permission of those in charge
of operations of that section of the
line.
Advices from Washington that the
state department had prepared a
memorandum urging Carranza to de
cide the question of using the rail
road without waiting for the ratifi
cation of the protocol, revived the
hope that perhaps by Thursday the
store held at El Paso may be forward
ed to some field depot accessible to
the troops now operating almost 300
miles from the boundary line.
Cavalry Position Unknown.
Exactly where Colonel Dodd's cav
alry is now, or into how many de
partments it has been divided, was
unknown at General Funston's head
quarters today.
The exact whereabouts of General
Pershing also remained unreported,
but this lack of information created
no uneasiness, for General Pershing
still has orders,to work out his own
problems. Full realization of the
danger into which some of the ad
vance departments must be moving,
was acknowledged. Villa's known
ability as' a director of ambuscade
has aroused a frank expression of fear
among army officers that he may trap
some of the American troops in a
mountain trap.
Holding Up.
The shifting line of the trail Villa
is leading the pursuing Americans
has made more apparent the ability
of getting permission to use the
Juarez-Chihuahua line of the Nation
al, as well as the Northwestern rail
way, but General Funston has re
frained from making any represen
tation on the subject, preferring not
to present a possible embarrassing
feature in the negotiations already
under way for the other line.
It was pointed out that supplies
routed through Chihuahua would be
delivered to the advance troops now
with less loss of time and that a line
of communication established along
that would be guarded with fewer
troops than one along the more cir
cuitous route of the Northwestern.
FUNERAL OF JOHN
ROE HELD TODAY
The funeral of John Roe, who died
Sunday, was held this afternoon from
the Episcopal church. The services
were in charge of the Odd Fellows
lodge of which he was a member.
Delegations of the Bemidji Fire
men's association and the Maccabees,
of which he was a member, also at

The pallbearers were E. R. Jahr,
L. Given, Dr. A. V. Garlock, George
W. Rhea, Dr. C. J. Larson and M.
E. Ibertson. Interment was made in
Greenwood cemetery.

Bemidji police took five children
home last evening after eight o'clock
charged with violating the curfew
law. The next time these same chil
dren are seen by the police after
eight o'clock in the evening unac
companied,, their parents will be no
