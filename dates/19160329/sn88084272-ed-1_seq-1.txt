Artillery Flares Up and In

in Attack, but Fails.
. i
Paris, France, March 29. After a six j
days lull, the Germans resigned the of
fensive at Verdun yestcrdav with re
dpubled .violence. The hotter to hide
their plans, for a week the Germans
had been shelling the Verdun front lib
erally, but the French expected the
attack would come on the west of the
river and made all due preparations.
The German effort was confined to a
section half a mile in width, between
Avocourt and Malancourt The artillery
ponred a hail of shells on this short
line all afternoon in preparation for the
infantry attack, which was launched
at 3 oclock in the afternoon. The at
tacking; masses, about a division strong,
dashed forward over the ground which
had been ploughed up .by the shells of
their heavy suns, apparently expecting
an easy victory.
French Hold Their Ground.
They reckoned, however, without the
French infantry and the French light
artillery, which had been skilfully shel
tered from the bombardment. The
French infantry held off the Germans
with rifle and machine gun fire, while
the 75's threw a curtain of shells which
prevented reserves from approaching.
Again the gray coated waves surged
forward, only to be broken against the
etout resistance of the defenders.
The object of the Germane was to
force the French to evacuate the vil
lage of Malancourt, the heights sur
rounding which the Germans already
hold. They failed completely, it is af
firmed, and the French bold Malan
court salient as firmly as ever.

VICTORIES OF FRENCH DUE
TO RAILROAD ASSISTANCE
Paris, Franc , March 29. "The bat
tles of the Yser and Ypres were, in the
first Instance, won bv the French rail
roads, and though the - German lines
possessed certain initial advantages
over them, they have held their own
throughout the war," says an officer
closely concerned in the mobilization,
concentration and displacement of the
French troops.
It appears that Gen. Joffre foresaw
the German flanking movement toward
Calais during the last days of the bat
tle of the Marne, and began sending
troops to parry it as early an Septem
ber S. Between that date and the be
ginning of October 800 trains carried 17
army corps and three divisions of cav
alry northwards.
A review of the military operations
beginning with the mobilization shows
that the railroads of France have ac
complished everything that was expect
ed of them, contrary to the experience
of 1870.
The railroads became a maneuvering
instrument when the concentration
period was finished and played a cap
ital role In the battle of the Marne.
liven during the battle of Charlerol,
the allies' left was reinforced by three
divisions brought from the region of
Nancy in 200 trains in three days' time.

Says Embalmer Was Paid
$9000 to Testify He Used
Arsenic in Embalming.
New Y'ork, l.arcn 29. Detectives
from the district attorney's office went
to Orient Point, I I., today in search
of Eugene O'Kane, nn embalmer, who
now is the most important witness In
the Peck murder caBe.
Dr. Arthur Warren Waite, m the lat
est chapter of his serial confession, told
the district attorney that he had riven
Kane $9000 to swear if necessary thatl
ne nao usea arsenic in embalming the
body of John E. Peck for burial.
The use of arsenic in embalming
fluid is against the law in Netv York
state and Kane several days ago was
quoted as saying that no 'arsenic was
used in embalming Mr. Peck's body.
From Waite's revelations tho autho
rities have concluded that he was pre
paring for a pica of not suilty in tho
event of his arrest for the murder. TJi
rest of the dentist's confession, how
ever, has eonvfneed the district attor
ney that he is getting ready to defend
himself on a plea of Insanity.
Dr. Watte last night told representa
atives of the district attorneys office
that he had administered several va
rieties of disease germs to both Mr.
Peck and his wife, Mrs. Anna Maria
Peck. When the germs showed no re
sults, Waite said, he followed them in
both rases with poisonous drugs. In
committing these acts. Waite declared
that he was under the evil Influence
of a force which he personified as "the
man from Egypt."
