Santa Maria Valley, four days
aero, according to a report to
General Funston this morning.
General Pershing said that
the residents of the valley ap
peared to be friendly to Villa,
which is giving the American

Villa's movements.

FILLED AND A BIG MODERN
HOTEL WILL BE BUILT AT THE
CORNER OR MAIN AND C.
The Sharp proposition ,was formally
accepted by the hotel committee in a
meeting yesterday afternoon and the
subscription of stock of the amount
demanded by Mr. Sharp It nearly all
raised.
iMr. Sharp asks that the citizens
take stock to the amount of fifty
thousand dollars, stating that he will
add seventy-five thousand more. Of
this amount there was subscribed yes
terday afternoon approximately forty
thousand dollars, with several weal
thy men yet to hear from.
It has not been ascertained just
when work will begin on the building,
but it is presumed that it will be
started at once, as there is a grow
ing demand for a hotel here every
day.
Other sites were considered by th
hotel committee, but nothing satisfac
tory could be secured. The committea
desires that every citizen get behind
this proposition and assist in build
ing a hotel second to none in the
state, regardless of personal prefer
ment.

FOR DELEGATE
THE CONGRESSMAN HAS REA
SONS WHY HE WANTS TO GO TO
NATIONAL CONVENTION AT ST.
LOUIS.
Washington, D. ('., March 29. Con
gressman Wm. H. Murray of the
fourth district of Oklahoma has given
oul the following statement:
"Yes, 1 am a candidate for delegate-at-large
to the national convention, be
cause I think it is necessary in the
interest of our platform Unit will be
adopted at. St, Louis agreeable to the
wishes of the president and his friends.
Oklahoma ought to have at least one
delegates who lias the knowledge at
first hand here in Washington of the
intrigues of the opposition, both to the
President and his policies, particular
ly as it relutes to preparedness. The
Interviews appearing in the newspa
pers some days ago from Oklahoma
City to the effect that the St. Iouis
convention would bo a "raiilicutlon
meeting" is erroneous. Why is it that
some states not having primaries have
announced that they will send unin-
struc.ted delegations to St. Ixniis? Why
is it that the opposition to the presi
dent all at once has apparently sub
sided, and yet many prominent men
who opposed his policies are now can-
.dilates for delgate? It is clear to
my mind that they hope to adopt a
-platform to embarrass him and force j
him to decline the nomination. Mem-i
burs of the party should either firht !
the nresidenfa nomination nonlv r 1
else support a platform agreeable to
his record. If we are going to nomi-
nate Wilson, we should do it with the
tiiis record.
"I am pleased to note that my let
ter sent out to Oklahoma has had the
effect of breaking one slate which
would liave proved hostile to the presi
dent and liia platform."
ELEVEN DEATHS IN STORM
London, March 29. Eleven deaths

BE SEIZED
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT IS CON
SIDERING THIS AS SOLUTION TO
ECONOMIC PROBLEM TO BE
USED AS RESERVE.
.Mexico City, March 23. The pub-li.-lier'
'Minreiuent that the govern
ment lering the advisability of
ta kin 1 the personal and real
ty ' of the Catholic clergy
tlir .ne republic, created a svn-
sti. - e this morning, in a special
lisnitch from Qtieretaro, Li Domocra-
ta, the official organ, quotes both Sec
retary of the Treasury Cabrera and Dr.
Siurob, governor of the state of Guana
juato, as saying that the measure
would be made effective tinder the old
law dating back more than half a
century, when church edifices were
seized during the administration of
Benito Juarez.
Tiie clergy in the states of .Michoa
can, i'liabla, Qtieretaro and Jalisco,
are reputed to le immensely wealtUy
in jewels, lands and works of art,
which are held in 'trust for the church.
It is said that the appropriation of
these by the .government for their
conversion into gold, with which to
swell the reserve to be accumulated
for the redemption of the paper money
issue made necessary t by the revolu
tion, would s.Mve Mexico's present eco-
n,3inic difficu ties. Government offi
cial declaratioi ilace the present pa
per issue at 500,l)i,u. 100 pesos, with an
insignificant metallic reserve for its
redemotion.
The government is making every
effort possible at this time to accumu-
rate as rapidly as possible the neoes-
sufficiently guaranteed to stabilize ex
change without the necessity of re
sorting to a foreign loan. The methods
already employed In this direction,
including the collection of part of the
customs duties and internal revenue
taxes in gold, toegther with the na
tional appeal for patriotic subscrip
tions to meet the issues have pro
duced excellent results. Government
officials say that the application of
the reform laws of th late '60s would
speedily solve the problem.

OPERA HOUSE
CONDEMNED
UNSAFE FOR CROWD SAYS BUILD
ING INSPECTOR, ALL SHOWS
CANCELLED. PHILHARMONIC
ORCHESTRA AT HIGH SCHOOL.
The Hobison opera house is a thing
of the past.
Yesterday the building Inspectors,
after looking over the premises, in
formed owner Von Weise that he
would Ibe taking long chances in al
lowing a gathering ithere. Mr. Von
Weise who recently purclmsed the
propvty ithoreupon Immediately in
formed Prank Robison who has been
acting as manager for the house, that
all othor shows would be canceled and
there would be no more opera house
in Ardnure so far as he was con
cerned. Mr. Von Weise urchased the
property with the idea of converting
it into an office building, but was in
tending to finish out the season, had
not .the building been condemned. He
will therefore begin remodeling the
building sooner than anticipated and
in the meantime It will be up to some
enterprising business man to erect u
modern theatre where the "legit" will
compete with the -movies.
The next great attraction that was
to have been shown in the house was
the New York Philharmonic orchestra
but arrangements have been made for
the high school auditorium instead.

thirty and the exact number
may not be known before night.
Twenty-five bodies had been
taken out at noon and live more
are known to be in the wreckage.
Cleveland, Ohio, March 29.
Twenty-one are known to be
dead and twenty-five seriously
injured, some of them fatally,
in the wreck of three fast New
York Central trains, including
the Twentieth Century Limit
ed, at Amherst, near here at
four o'clock this morning.
Rescuers are working fran
tically to recover more of the
dead and injured from the mass
of wreckage. Most of the killed
were in the rear day coach of
one train, which was crashed
into by another.- The bodies of
the scantily clad were mutilat
ed beyond identification. None
of the Limited's passengers
were killed.
One section of the east
bound train had stopped to
take water and owing to the
fog, the second section crashed
into the first from the rear.
Then the Twentieth Century
Limited, west-bound, came
tearing through, crashing into
the wreckage of both the east
bound trains.
Two coaches of the Twentieth Cen
tury Limited were overturned, injur
ing a number of passengers. Th4
low number of casualties is attributed
to the Limited's going slow on ac
count of the fog. The second section
on tho Buffalo Filer was going fast
when It struck the first section. Tho
three trains in tho wreck wero two
sections of the Buffalo Flier and tho
Limited, which is the New York Cen- .
tral's pride.
