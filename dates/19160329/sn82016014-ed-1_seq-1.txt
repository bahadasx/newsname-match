$9,000 FOR A LIE
Dr. Waite. Poisoner, Says He
Bribed Undertaker.
Wa to Testify He Used Arsenic
in Embalming Fluid.
Xew York. March 20. Detectives
from the district attorney's office
went to Orient Point. Long Island, to
day In search of Eugene O. Kane, an
embalmer, wanted as a witness in the
Peck murder case. Dr. Arthur War
ren Waite in the latest chapter of hin
serial confession told the district at
torney that he had given Kane $9,000
to swear if necessary that he had used
arsenic in embalming the body of
John R. Peck for burial.
The young dentist in his confession
has convinced the district attorney
that he is getting ready to defend him
self on a plea of insanity.
Dr. Waite, in conversation with rep-
1 resentative of the district attorney's
office last night, said he had admin
istered several varieties of disease
germs to both Mr. Peck and his wife.
Mrs. Anna Maria Peck. When the
germs showed no results Waite said
h followed them in both cases with
doses of poisonous drugs.
In committing these acts. Waite de
clared that he was under evil influence
of a force which he personified as
"The man from Egypt." Dr. Waite
rambled on about the way in which
the evil genius had compelled him to
put the disease germs in food served
to Mr. and Mrs. Peck and when these
failed to take effect to accomplish the
death of Mr. Peck by putting arsenic
in his soup, in tea and in eggnog.
Kane fed Oct S25.OO0.
District Attorney Swann this after-
i noon ordered the immediate arrest of
Kugej.e Olive Kane, on the basis of a
further confession from Waite. He
Indicated Kane would be held as a
conspirator to cheat justice, if Waite's
; story is borne out. Waite, he said, had
: stated that Kane was to receive $25.

trail.
Delving into the history of Kane,
the undertaker to whom Waite claims
he paid $9,000 to srear. if occasion
demanded, that he used arsenic in
embalming Peck's body, the district
attorney's office found that he was
formerly connected with the under
taking establishment which prepared
for burial Mrs. Catherine Adams, the
victim of the famous Molyneaux poi
son case.

PRICES WILL SOAR
Topeka Merchants Admit That
Increase Is Coming.
Wholesale Costs Necessitate an
Equal Retail Raise.
FROM 20 TO 2000 PER CENT
When Present Stocks Are Ex
hausted, Trouble Must Begin,
Interviews With Men in Differ
ent Lines in Topeka.
Merchants in all lines interviewed
today admitted that increases- in
wholesale prices had caused or would
cause an increase in the price of their
goods sold to the public. Many are
fortified themporarily. against the high
prices, in vogue all over the country,
by stocks purchased before advances
became so marked. In every instance
the merchant admitted the situation
serious and an increase for protection
either adopted now or absolutely
necessary unless the situation clarifies
within the next few months.
Increases noted vary from 20 per
cent to 2,000 per cent. The market
right now on several staple lines is
closed and when the present stock on
these products is exhausted by local
merchants there appears no possibility
of obtaining more of it unless Ameri
can manufacturing plants are estab
lished or increased in capacity to sup
ply a demand formerly furnished by
European concerns,
Like increases to consumers for pro
tections against operating loss is the
only salvation, merchants declared to
day. No attempt is being made to
make money out of the war situation
but the merchants all feel that they
cannot afford to keep their prices sta
tionary with the prices on wholesale
goods doubling and trebling them
selves. Printers Face Problem.
"All printers will be forced to raise
their prices where any quantity of
paper, leather, ink or metal is used."
Such was a statement made today
by C. L. Mitchell, secretary of Crane
& Company.
"Printers." said Mr. Mitchell, "al
ways have been and probably always
will be among the last to raise prices.
In this section of the country the mar
gin of profit on printing has been
much less than in most sections of the
country for two reasons.
"One is that not until the last few
years have printers gone to the ex
pense of keeping a careful analysis of
their actual cost. The second is that
there are so many of the smaller shops
without practically any overhead ex
pense, who have figured that working
wages were sufficient, and no allow
ance made for depreciation or other
overhead expense.
"As an instance a quotation this
morning on a job of printing shows an
increase of $18.30 in the actual cost
of the paper required, and that much
had to be added to the original quota
tion. All printers employing union

Writers have burst into song, as the
above will indicate, for it's a refrain
i from a song received by Dr. S. J.
Crumbine, secretary of the state board
5 of health, treating fly swatting from
major to minor key.
Both state and city officials are
united in an effort to make Topeka a
fly less city this summer, and if the
citizens will lend their aid flies will
be scarce this season. In fact, an edict
hat gone forth making this the open
I season on flies of all variety and kind
! and it will require no license to wage
j war on the pest.
That flies are a rapid means of
transmission of various diseases has
I been proven and it behooves every cit
izen to get busy with his or her little
swatter and swat on the slightest
j provocation.
Tf the advice given by the various

To Be a Flyless Town.
"We are going to make a big ef
fort to make Topeka fly-proof this
summer, or as nearly so aa possible."
said Dr. H. L. Clark, city health offi
cer. "Mr. Porter has added another
sanitary inspector for the summer,
and a close watch will be kept on al
leys, back yards and vacant lots to
force the cleaning up of refuse that
affords breeding places for the flies.
"People maintaining the antiquated
sanitary, or insanitary, institution
known as the outdoor toilet, will be
required to make their toliets fly
proof, which should further cut down
the number of breeding places for the
fly. A big effort is being made to se
cure sewer connections with all out

property owners are being ordered,
every week to make connections with'
the sewers where we find they are not

FOR NEWLOCATiGN
Conmiereial Clnlt Negotiating:
for Elks Building.
Indications Arrangement Be
Satisfactory Both Clubs.
Negotiations are under way looking
to the purchase by the Topeka Com
mercial club of the Elks building at
the corner of Seventh and Jackson
streets, provided arrangements mu
tually satisfactory to both organiza
tions can be effected.
To this end a committee has been
named by the Commercial club con
sisting of Carroll B. Merriam. E. L.
Copeland. Horace L. Hall, J. Sl Dean
and W. H. Davis. A meeting has
; been held with the trustees of the
Elks, and at a meeting at the Com
; mercial club today it was decided ti
make the Elks a tentative offer, con
tingent upon agreeable financial and
practical arrangements.
It has been point td out that there
1 are various good reasons why the a-c-
complishment of this nurpose would
i be a satis fact ory result for both or
i ganizations.
By a fortunate circumstance the
i Elks baye a good building, too larg
'and too exper give to maintain for
. their organization. The Commercial
club on the other hand needs larger
and permanent quarters. Another fa
vorable situation exists because about
two-thirds of the membership of the
. Elks belong to the Commercial club.
It is also declared that it will he en
tirely practical for both the Commer
cial club and the Elks to use the Elks
; building temporarily until the latter
' could make arrangements suitable and
satisfactory for Elks permanent head
I quarters. The space allotted for a cafe
'in the Elks block is sufficiently large
j to accommodate the average number
i of each organization taking their
noon-day luncheons at their respective
rooms. The billiard room also is of
ample size so that there is room for
the four billiard tables of the Com
j mercial club to be moved therein.
!The Elks in the event of such a tem
porary arrangement would, of course,
retain the use of their lodge room
each week for the two nights of their
regular meetings and retain probably
other rooms they would need for the
time being and whu h the Commercial
club could give up until the Elks se
cured their future and permanent lo
cation. GRAIN VIA PANAMA

Berlin. March 29. German
troops have broken the French
front for more than 2.0O0 yards,
capturing several lines of trenches
in the fighting north of Malen
court, 10 miles northwest of Ver
dun, the war office announced
this afternoon. The Germans
captured 198 prisoners and five
guns. The new drive carried the
Germans into the northwest por
tion of the village of Malencourt
itself.
Paris, March 29. French troops
made an attack last night on Avocourt
wood west of the Meuse, where the
German assault was made yesterday.
The official statement today says the
French carried part of the works
which the Germans had constructed.
The Germans made a fierce counter
attack but were driven back with
heavy losses.
They made no effort to recover the
lost ground.
The Day Attack.
After a six days lull the Germans
resumed the offensive at Verdun yes
terday with redoubled violence. To
hide their plans they had for a week
been shelling the whole Verdun front
impartially but the French staff ex
pected that the attack would come on
the west of the river and made all due
preparations. Their surmise was jus
tified by the event.
The German effort was confined to
a small section hardly more than half
a mile in width between Avocourt and
Malan court. The artillery poured a
hail of shells on this short line all
morning in preparation for the infan
try attack, which was launched at 3
o'clock in the afternoon. The attack
ing masses, about a division strong,
dashed forward over the ground
which had been ploughed up by the
shells of their heavy guns, apparently
expecting an easy victory.
Infantry on the Job.
They reckoned, however, without
French infantry and the French light
artillery which has been sheltered
from the bombardment. Fsing every
advantage which the ground afforded,
the French infantry held the Germans
off with rifle and machine gun fire
while the 7 5s threw a curtain of shells
which prevented reserves from ap
proaching. Again the gray coated waves surged
forward only to he broken against the
stout resistance of the defenders. The
objeoi of the Germans was to force
the French to evacuate the village of
Malancourt. the heights surrounding
which the Germans already hold.
They failed completely, it is affirmed,
and the French hold the Malancourt
salient as firmly as ever.

GREEK SOUNDERS KILLED.
utial Nation Near Uprising Over
German Saloniki Raid.
Athens. Greece. March 2fl. The
aerial bombardment or Saloniki in
volving the death of Greek soldiers
and civilians, has aroused deep feeling
here which finds expression in bitter
editorials in the liberal press against
the continued neutrality of Greece.
The question of declaration of martial
law was again raised in an exciting
session of the chamber of deputies
which lasted until late last night.
The government discouraged all
hostile comment on actions of Ger
mans and Premier Skouloudis de
clined to continue a debate involving
discussion of foreign relations, be
cause the highest interests impose
silence. Notwithstanding the attitude
of government the Saloniki raid was
characterized in the chamber as "Sim
ply assassination" and as "German
frightfulness," designed to intimidate
the Greeks. Plans were on foot to
hold mass meetings at Saloniki but the
government has forbidden them

El I'aso. March 29.- A peaceful -o-
, lotion of the relations between the
' United States and Mexico seemed
; nearer today than a any time since
the Villa raid on Column us, N. M.,
! March 9. which was followed within
!a week by the American punitive e
j pedition.
The peaceful nature of the Amerl
i can expedition, army officials here in
dicated, was shown bv the fact that
j not an American soldier has b"en in-
jured by a hostile bullet since the bor
1 der was crossed two weeks ago.
Failure of an organized attempt on
jboth sides of th'" border to transfcrm
: the campaign against bandits into in
j tervention, pleased both American and
ICarranzista officials here. They llt-
tie doubted that a "rumor factory"
' maintained in El l'aso and other bor-
i der points, spread re.oorts of Mexican
uprisings and racial aniagonism to in
flame both sides and compel interven-
! tion.
! Negro Troop-. Kat Children.
i United States army officers pointed
to the friendly rec-ption given the ex-
': peditionary fore in Mexico. Villa haa
t so far failed to raise the peons against
i the Gringoes, despite his speeches that
: American troops were coming to ma-
i sacve and burn. H told the Mexicans
: that the United States negro troops ate
: ehildr'-n. Some Mexicans first fled In
iierrtor at the approach of the expedi
tion vanguard but r -fumed when they
found the soldiers friendly and willing
to pay a good price ror supplies. Mex
ican papers in border cities also failed
to inflame the peons. Probably the
only increase in ViUa's forces have
been secured at the rifle point.
