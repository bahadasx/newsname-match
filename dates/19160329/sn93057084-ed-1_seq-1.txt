completed, in the quickest time on
record, this owing to the addition
to the service of the two new

The several improvements which
have been made on the boat since
last season already show up to
good advantage. Among these are
heavier rudders, removal of the
second story cabin, change of the
stairs to the front end of the boat,
new and heavier sprocket chains
and wheel etc. and to finish up
with, everything is to get. a regu
lation coat of paint this summer,so
