very little aid from us
There have been various Committees
from tiriio to timo, for the purpose of
raising funds for our depleted Treasury,
which went down to a balance of .01 at

The growing of these plains awakened
quite a little interest, und we hope an?

Corresponding Secretary has communicat?
ed lit various times on the subject ?fl'?b

Council, School Hoard, Hoard of Health,
and State Hoard of Pbulic Health.

a called meeting of the League with Ors.
Williati? and llroomflcld of the State
Hoard of Health, and on both occasloua
got up signed petitions of citizens for

Supervisors, urging the creation of this
Public Health Officer for the County.
We have been honored in having our
Mayor ami two Drs. of our local Hoard of
Health attend our meetings, furthering
the Spirit of co-operation and fellowship
for working for the good of our tow n.
The spirit of our work is still spreading.

of tlir people The same is true
of any work whoso object is tin
improvement of the people's
health. The hi st trained ex
port in health matters, the van
oils hoards of health, the medi?
cal societies, und the physi
eiuns, either singly or combin?
ed, cannot bring good health to
the people; nor will the mere
asking lor it on the people's
part give it. Dollars alone will
not liny it. Any health move?
ment I care not if it have a
hand of trained experts at its
bond and receive the support of
tho vurioUs health organizations |
and physicians of tin- country,
will in the end he u miserable j
failure unless the people give

cess will he measured by tlio |
amount of co-oporrilion it re- j
ceives. It is true that Public
Health is ptirchnscablc ami
much disease can be prevented
by spending a few paltry del
tars, hut tlm expenditure of
money must he accompanied by
good common sense and the
willingness of all the people to
assist in tie- woik, if much
benefit is to be received.
The splendid work accoin
plisbcd by the Community
Health Work during the past
n\o months in this county has j
been made possible only by llicj
c.i operation of tin- people in the
communities in which the work
was undertaken. Up to the
present time a large number of
sanitary privies have been con?
structed, making it possible to
gel rid of many of the tilth

ed ami over seventy per cent ol
them found infected with one
or more intestinal parasites,
rh'o work is progressing well in
communities of Urtib < 'rchard
and W. st Norton and has til
most been completed at Kasl

the people will render the same
assistance in the future as in
the past, ho that the work will
accomplish the greatest good
possible.
