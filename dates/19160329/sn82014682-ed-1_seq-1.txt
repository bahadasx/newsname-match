Does that answer your question?"

ton, t '
J. W. Waldron; president of the
Sugar Factors Company, Ltd., is one
of the optimists. .-
"My Idea may not be in accord with
the majority of sugar men here." says
.Mr. Waldron. "but 1 would just as
soon have it this way (meaning free
sugar in 1920) because by that time
the United States will be just as
much in want of revenue as the coun
try is today, and in the meantime the
beet-sugar industry on the mainland
will aot go ahead as much as if the
duty on sugar were repealed altogeth
er. Capitalists are not going to put
up million-dollar beet sugar refineries
"on uncertainties."
Repeal Still Possible.
That the old Kitchln bill, providing
for" absolute repeal of the free sugar
clause of the. present tariff law, may
still have a chance in the opinion of
Georg Rodiek, vice-president of the
Sugar Factors. "The probabilities are
that the old Kitchin bill still has a
chance to pass," he says, "when it is
brought before the conference com
mittee." v When asked for his views on the
situation, E. F. Bishop was not so
optimistic. "It depends on the con
ference committee's action," he states,
'as to whether the old bill has any
show. I can't tell what's going to be
done. It's simply a case of wait and
see."
F. M. Swanzy, managing director of
Theo. H. Davies & Company, would
not venture to make a prediction, say
ing that the cables and news despatch
es received here have not been defi
alte enough fqr him to form a decided
opinion on the situation.
"I don't know anything about the
sugar situation other than what I've
read in the papers is the only com
ment Arthur W. T. Bottomley, former
president of the Sugar Factors," has
to make.
