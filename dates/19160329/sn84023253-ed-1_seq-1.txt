Will Be Candidate For Republican
Nomination For Governorship
of Vermont
Barton, Vt., Mar. 18, 1916.
Horace F. Graham. Esq.,
Craftsbury, Vermont.
Dear Mr. Graham:
As you are being frequently men
tioned for the office of Governor I
have taken the liberty of writing you
and inquiring if you will be a candi
date for that office at the primaries in
September. r
Hoping I may hear from you, I am
Yours very truly,
WALLACE H. GILPIN.
Horace F. Graham, Vermont's Next
Governor.
Mr. Graham's Reply.
Craftsbury, Vt., Mar. 25, 1916.
Wallace H. Gilpin, Esq.,
Barton, Vt, .
Dear Mr. Gilpin: "
I have your letter of March 18th in
quiring If I am be e candidate for
Governor at the primaries in Septem
ber. I shall be a candidate for the nomin
ation to the office of Governor at the
September primaries. Inasmuch as
under the primary law the platform of
the party is to be made by a conven
tion composed of the nominees for
state senators and town representa
tives and the six elective officers, I
will only say at this time that from my
fourteen years' experience as Auditor
of Accounts I have come to certain
definite conclusions as to what will
tend to advance the interests of our
state and make her government more
efflcent and less expensive.
Later on I will be glad to go into
these matters in detail but for the
present let me say that I feel that we
should first adequately care for the
state institutions we have, and the state
endeavors we are engaged upon be
fore we take up new enterprises, and
that certain of our Boards and Com
missions can be consolidated or dis
pensed with without injury to the pub
lic service.
Yours very truly,
HORACE F. GRAHAM.
Horace F. Graham was born in New
York, February 7, 1862,- and was edu
cated in the common schools and at
Craftsbury academy. He graduated
from the schools of political science
and law at Columbia college in 1838
and was admitted to the Vermont bar
in October of that year and located at
Craftsbury. He has held several town
offices in that town, was states attor
ney for the county of Orleans from
1898 to 1902. He was elected presi
dential elector in 1900. He was a
member of the house of representa
tives In 1892 and again in 1900. He
was elected state auditor in 1902 and
re-elected in 1904, 1906, 1908, 1910,
1912 and 1914. He also served as
member of the educational commission
of the state of Vermont from 1912 to
1914.
COUNTY POLITICS
Some of The Farly Sprouts Appearing
In the Biennial Crop.
Candidates for county offices are be
ginning to appear although the full
crop lacks much of appearing above
the ground. Like the robins there are
always some ahead of the main flock
to get their names in the paper as the
first on the ground. There will be
some contests and some of the candi
dates may not be obliged to meet a
contestant in the primaries. We sim
ply mention some of the earliest
sprouts in the political field.
For county senator, W. P. Russell
of Kirby is mentioned qufte favorably
and it is reported that M. G. Morse of
Hardwick would like to add the title
of senator to his list. Who St. Johns
bury will ask to be a candidate for
senator Is not clear. The name of W.
A. Rlcker has been mentioned but he
does not say he will be a candidate.
For sheriff. Wilbert H. Worthen Is
a candidate for re-election and so far
no one has appeared in the lists against
him.
For assistant judges, it is supposed
the primary law will not change the
custom of giving a man two terms In
this office. If that is the case Nelson
A. Dole will be the candidate for first

FRAUD ALLEGED
Officers of American News Vend
ing: Company On Trial at Bur-lington-G.
B. Arnold Plaintiff.
Harry W. Witters is in Burlington
representing the defendants in the
case of Gardner B. Arnold of Burling
ton vs. E. X. Somers, et al., an action
in which the plaintiff seeks to recover
$10,000 from the above-named de
fendant and six others, ' including the
American News Vending company of
St. Johnsbury, the Eureka News Vend
ing company of Plattsburgh, N. Y
and F. M. Abbott. Charles Weeks, J.
E. Alexander, A. P. Ladd and Dr. W.
J. Aldrich, former officers and direct
ors of the American News Vending
company of St. Johnsbury, for the al
leged fradulent sale of the patent
rights territory of the state of New
York, in which the plaintiff was to
sell the vending machines of the
American News " Vending company,
which was begun at last Wednesday
afternoon's session of Chittenden ;
county court. The plaintiff is repre-
sented by V. A. Bullard and S. R.
Moulton, and the defendants by C. H.
Darling, R. E. Brown. Levi P. Smith
and H. W. Witters of the firm of Por
ter, Witters & Harvey of St. Johns
bury, and Judge-Zed S. Stanton is the
presiding judge. It is expected the
case will be finished today.
E. X. Somers' Testimony
E. X. Somers of Danville, formerly
of St. Johnsbury, where he was presi
dent of the American News Vending
company, was the first witness called
by the plaintiff's counsel. ' He testified
to a contract between the American
News Vending company and G. B.
Arnold and J. E. Alexander. The
terms of the contract called for the
payment of $12,000 from Arnold and
Alexander to the American News
Vending company, in sums of $3,000,
$5,000 and four of $1,000 each, for the
patent rights to the manufacture and
sale in the state of New York of the
company's machines. The witness
identified seven checks of Mr. Arnold's
in payment of his half of this money,
or $6,000, and also identified the re
ceipts given for each check, each re
ceipt being given for the total amount
of the sum due, of which Mr. Arnold
paid one-half, although the witness
admitted that Mr. Alexander had never
paid a single cent of his share. The
witness admitted that he had never
revealed to Arnold the fact that Alex

assistant judge and O. C. Woodruff of
West Burke a candidate for second as
sistant judge.
For state's attorney, it is supposed
N. A. Norton of Lyndonville will be a
candidate for re-election but he has
made no announcement as yet. Wheth
er or not there will be other candidates
is not known.
Caledonia county republicans may
be well represented at the national
convention in Chicago. The name of
T. N. Vail has been very generally ap
proved in the state press as a member
of the state delegation. Mr. Vail has
made no announcement as to his atti
tude on the matter but it is under
stood that in case there is no contest
Mr. Vail might be pleased to represent
Vermont in that gathering. In case
Mr. Vail should decline to allow the
use of his name Hon. Alexander Dun
nett has been favorably mentioned for
that honor. He has many friends who
would like to show him some honor
for the clean but unsuccessful fight
he made for congressman two years
ago. In case Mr. Vail desires to go to
Chicago Mr. Dunnett may be chosen
as a district delegate.
Probably there will be additional
aspirants for county offices to be con
sidered later.

ROAD MEN MEET
State Commissioner Bates Urges
Early Construction For State
Highways And Good Patrol.
Every road commissioner in Cale
donia county, all but three or four
selectmen and others from outside
the county met at Pythian hall last
Wednesday afternoon with Stoddard
B. Bates, state highway commissioner
for instructions relating to highway
work the coming season. The total at
tendance was about 115 and much in
terest was manifested. County Road
Commissioner M. M. Stocker of Dan
ville arrived that morning from a win
ter spent in California, in time to at
tend the county meeting and spoke
briefly, outlining his plans for this
season.
Commissioner Bates at the forenoon
session - spoke on construction work,
urging that state roads be built as
early in the season as possible so they
can be used before frost sets in. He
said this county had appropriated
$400 more this year than last to be
matched dollar for dollar by the state
so there would be a large amount of
construction work to be done. He
will demand the construction of uni
form railings painted white on all of
the state work where railings are
needed.
He said that the resurfacing of the
older improved roads should be done
more generally than in the past and
that the state would match dollar for
dollar up to $500 per town for re
surfacing. The resurfacing should
all be done in May or June or left un
til October a.s this kind of work done
in dry season does not endure.

work last season was $74 a mile and
the state paid from $20 to $50 a mile
of this expense. The state is ready to
aid in the same way this season.
There was quite a little discussion
by some of the ofiioials in attendance.
