Six persons were burned to death
and a number of others narrowly es
caped a similar faite in a tire which

Jas. B. Waltball, former Attorney
General of Texas, and his wife; Ho
mer Jones, of San Antonio; Mrs.
Maco Stewart, of G<a Iveston, and
Helen Cock rill, a maid employed at
tho club. Their charred bodies were
found In the ruin? lato to-day.
The lire originated in some paint
stored in the basement of the build
ing and is believed to have been due
to Bi'ontancous combustion.
Jones and Mrs. Stewart lost their
lives in an attempt to rescue Judge
Webb. They had escaped from the
building, but fearing that the attor
ney had not heard the alarm because
of defective hearing, returned to
awaken him. They wero making
their way to nu exit with Judge
Webb when the party was overe?me
by smoke and fell Into the Hames.

What tho Movement Means.
Teachers, Trustees and Patrons of
Oconeo county.
The Torces of the civilized world
are being marshalled In battle array.
The cry in our awn country is pre
paredness. The order has come from
our government for each State to be
able at a moment's notice to send
forward lier quota. We ?re re
viewing our resources that we may
be prepared to resist attack from
any quarter. Just as dreadful as the
scourge of militarism and imperial
ism and despotism is the scourge of
ignorance ami indifference. Against
this scourge the public school ls our
strongest bulwark. It behooves us,
then, to take ever as our motto
"Preparedness," or its synonym,
"Power." One of the most effective
ways of securing preparedness ls to
organize our forces into one compact
educational unit. Each school in the
county, from the smallest one-teacher
school to the high school, needs to
feel itself a vital 'part of the great
educational system of Oc.onee coun
ty. Let each child in the county
march on Field Day in the grand pa
rade behind his school banner, and
participate in Hie honors his school
may win, and he will no longer feel
his isolation. He becomes a part of
the whole. He feels the energy and
dignity and spirit of the whole. At
the sanie time his loyalty to his own
school will be quickened.
Ignorance and indifference are bro
ken down by friendly and social in
tercourse. The school is not only
tho educational center, but the so
cial and moral center ns well. On
Field Day an occasion is provided
for the social intercourse necessary
to give stimulation and zest and en
joyment to life. Few things in life
are more important than a good time.
Another element of preparedness
is the struggle within the group. Let
one school compete with another In
friendly and wholesome rivalry, and
development must follow. New ideas
are gained., new ambitions aroused,
new powers discovered, old powers
developed. Field Day gives oppor
tunity for just such friendly compe
tition.
Let every citizen, -whether patron
of a cehool or not, see to lt that he
himself and every teacher and every
school child aro present at Walhalla
on March 31st to unite in this effort
to develop the public schools to their
utmost efficiency.
Walhalla Invites every one of you
to he present. Certainly her heart
ls big enough to hold the whole
county. Thoa. A. Smith,
County Supt, ot Education.

At Age of 76 Years Vene

Preacher and Pastor E
Hov. John Gordon Law, D. D., I
Ca 1 th f tv] m i Histor of tho Gospel, scho
lar, patriot and noble citizen, has
passed to his reward. The end came,
peacefully at his home in .Midway at
7 o'clock this morning, after a brief
illness from pneumonia. His illness
was of less than a week's duration.
The news of his death, ?though not
unexpected, came as a shock to the
community. The venerable minister
was loved wherever ho was known,
and he was known throughout Oco
nee as probably no other man in the
ministry was known. Oconee was
his immediate parish, though it could
truthfnny have been said of him
that "tho world was his parish." Ile
was broad of mind, and his tender
sympathy and great dove embraced
tile human race. Few men have
Ulled a place in religious, social and
civic spheres so well, so fait.1ifully
and for such a period of time, as he.
The emptiness of the oft-used ex
pression, "His place can never be
filled," is totally lacking, and lt will
conic to hundreds 'with full force as
the realization comes fully that Dr.
Law is no more.
The venerable minister passed as
wes his desire-os an active laborer
'n the Master's vineyard, .lust as a
period of service as supply to the
Wal hail la Presbyterian elm rel? was
drawing to a close, the summons
came to him, and he was ready. How
joyful to him to answer, with char
acteristic zeal and promptness,
"Lord, here am I." He loved tho
church at large, but the Walhalla
church was his first love, and he
longed to bo of service to this church
and its members and to tho Commu
nity. How well he fulfilled this de
sire not only the members of the
Presbyterian church and other de
nominations, but the entire commu
nity, can witness.
Dr. Law was 7 G yews of oge
last September, having been; born
September 14, 1839, at Columbia.
Tenn. He was a son of .lohn S.
La>w, M. H., and Sarai* Chapman
Gordon Law. His mother was a sis
ter of Gen. John B. Gordon, of Geor
gia. Me began his education in the
schools of Tennessee, and as he en
tered young 'manhood his aspirations
were, for wider knowledge. He was
a student of Jackson College (Tenn.)
1853-54; of the Medical College,
Memphis, 1860-61; and in later
years he studied at the University of
Edinburgh, Scotland, 1870-71, and
a't the Assembly College, Belfast,
Ireland, 1872-7H. He was licensed to
preach on June 10, 1809, In the Pres
bytery of Memphis, and was ordained
a's pastor of the Walhalla Presbyte

this being "his first pastorate. Be
