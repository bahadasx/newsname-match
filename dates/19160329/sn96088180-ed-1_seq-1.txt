27 KILLED IN CRASH OF
3 PASSENGER TRAINS
Early Morning Wreck in Ohio Sees Two Sections o! Lake
Shore train and the Twentieth Century limited of the
New York Central Railroad Piled Up With Many Dead
and Injured in the Morgue and Hospitals
Cleveland. 0., Mar. 2?, With a
craah audlblo two miles away, three
trains plied up near Amherst. Ohio,
before dawn today, killing at least
27 persons and injuring more than
40. " '"
Most of the caaualttea occurred In
the flrat section of eaatbound Lake
Shore train No. 86, which waa pro
ceeding slowly through a dense fo?
when the second section dashed Into
It. The shock threw both trains
from their own rails to the wentboun 1
track, and a moment later the Twen
tieth Century limited ploughed into
the wreckage.
People fully two miles distant from
the scene say they could distinctly
hear the terrible noises of the horror.
the shrieks of dying and mangleS vic
tims,' the roar of escaping steam and
the shouts of trainmen. In the atill-
neaa of early morning the sounds car
rled far through the mist
It waa so dark that the engineer
of the second section did not see the
red lantern which a brakeman, sent
back to warn him, awung frantical
ly before his eyes as the locomotive
(lashed by and rushed on toward the
doomed train and Ita sleeping passen
gers. Ambulances from Loralne, Am
herst and Elyrla attempted to apeed
through the dense fog and bring suc
cor to the injured, but all stuck In
the mud. The Injured lay on the
ground more than two hours, Most
of them were taken to Elyrla at 6:30
a. m. on a special train.
G. B. Gillette, of the Amherst fire
department, said:
"Masses of wreckage, piled In ev
ery direction, met my eyes when we
arrived. Coaches had been overturn
ed like toys. The firemen pulled 20
victims, Including a number of wo
men, from the windows. We prob
ably aaved them from cremation."
It. D. Turner, fireman of the loco
mottve on the flrat section, declares
the fog was almost Impenetrable.
"There waa such a fog , that we
could not aee 60 feet," he aald. "I
do not see how' Hess, the engineer
of the second section, could have seen
the algnal to stop." '
A vivid description of the collision
was given by Frank PrevoBt, of New
York, who was In a sleeper of the
first section. ,
"I was asleep," he said. "The
shock hurled me out of the window.
Washington, Mar. 29. Not only a
complete disavowal and punishment

kaiser's decree against armed enemy
merchant ships will be demnndod by
the United States It Germany admits
that a Teuton submarine torpodoed
tho nrltlsh channel steamer Sussex
without warning. The alternative
will be severance ot diplomatic rela

refuses to admit It, tho sumo action
will be taken. This will be the Amor

FOR ATTACKS Oil MERCHANTMEN
Before I realized what had happened,
!the Twentieth Century Umlted struck
the wreckage. Men and women in
their night' clothes wore scrambling
about. I heard cries, screams and
groans. . One man waa praying."
"It was a most ghastly eight," de
clared O. W. Hershaw, passenger In
the second coach, which was smashed
to kindling. "As I left the car, I
saw a man pick up a severed, leg. An
other man was carrying a bundle
wrapped in sheets and asked train
man. 'What shall I do with tnlsT'
The trainman asked, "What's in it?'
Whereupon the man replied, 'Anns
and legs.'
Legs and arms .were picked up
among the debris, lying mingled with
torn wearing apparel. It was impos
sible to piece together some bodies.
The remnants of a man and a woman
were found driven Into the steel bars
of the second locomotive's pilot
Conservative estimates said the
total killed would be 28 to SO. More
than 40 were injured. Fifteen of
the dead hare been identified and
there are nine unidentified. Several
more bodies' may be -pieced togetheHfested when the contents tf ihe gov-

A. S. Ingalls, general superintend
ent of the New York Central, ea,ld to
day that a sleepy towerman probably
was responsible for the horror.
One towerman's wife gs-ve birth to
a child Sunday, and the man, assert
ed Ingalls. had gone without sleep
for several nights. He was on duty,
It is said, when the second section of
a Lake Shore train, with Engineer
Hess at the throttle, boring through
the dense fog at CO miles an hour.
flashed past two light signals show
ing "all clear" and crashed Into the
first section, which waa moving slow
ly. , , ... .
Many were killed as they slept.
The terrific impact made the locomo
tive spear its way through the mist.
Then both trains jumped the rails
and tumbled on to the westbound
track, where the Twentieth Century
limited plunged Into the debris.
The dead were torn limb from
limb and many of the Injured were
mangled beyond description. Their
cries were audible at a distance of
two miles.

It Is known that the administration
Is prepared to go to the length of
breaking oft relations, not angrily,
but for the purpose of. obtaining posi

"Germany must pay handsomely If
