The German government has been
Risked whether any of its submarines
was concerned in the sinking of the
Englishman or the damaging of the
British channel steamer Sussex, which

While It Is indicated that the case
of itee Englishman may not lead to
difficulties between the United States
and Germany, if it is proved she was

state department from Dover, officials
said, seem- to bear out previous allega

American1 consular representatives, it
was said in the despatches, had se

affidavits confirming those by surviv

despatches were not disclosed here,
but it was said that the affidavits were
being forwarded by the officials who
had gathered them. ; -
The state department expects to re

El Paso, March 29 The hunt fop Francisco Villa by the
'flying columns of American cavalry continued today but from
the meagrene'ss of the official despatches from. General Persh
ling's advanced base it was impossible to learn the position of
ithe American troops and how
fleeing bandits. 1 5
Villa, was last heard of heading
.southward . toward the 'Tarahumare
'Mountain country, closely pursued by
' ' ; the American troopers. " . V

I now in the Chihuahua region appar
ently have iosttrace of -Villa and his
jmen, for no report has been received
i by Mexican officials here for some
jtime concerning the bandit's where
labouts. . ! 1
Armed bands of Villa forces are re
ported in various parts of Chihuahua
! and in some numbers around Torreon
but they are operating independently
of the main Villa command.
Carranza officials in Juarez express
.their belief that Villa will try to estab
lish' a main' base at some point after
he has thrown the' American cavalry
off his trail and then recruit his com
. mand to one of large proportions from
the bands now roving about the south
ern Chihuahua district. Villa, the
Carranza officers think, will then en
gage in a marauding campaign that
would give . the. American and Car
ranza forces no end of trouble. Army
officers here do not believe Villa Will
ever make a stand-, and fight the
American cavalry, but will continue
in flight until he escapes or is corn

Officials here say if the vessel had in-

Forty Thousand and Fifty
Thousand Dollar Bonds
Required In Action
As a result of trouble at the Long
Hill Quarries, two injunctions issued
under bonds of $90,000, have been
served on Melville E. Grey, who has
been in charge of mining property as
representative of the American
Electric Equipment Co. of New York.
One injunction was granted by Judge
Curtis of superior court and calls for
a bond of $40,000. The second was
issued by Judge Scott of the common
pleas court under bonds of $50,000.
It is alleged that Gray was agent
for the Equipment Co. and had charge
of machinery valued at $20,000. On
March 23 Gray was discharged. Since
then, it is claimed, he broke the tele
phone at the plant, took seven tung'
sten concentrates valued at $700 and
threatened to interfere with employes
in the performance of J:heir duties.
The injunction, granted by Judge Cur
tis restrains hintf from interfeiiug with
employes. i i

(Equipment Co., took over contracts' to
work on certain property belonging to
the Long Hill Quarries Co. Since he
was discharged Grey is alleged to have

from making a transfer and orders
Grey to render an accounting of all
profits from the property. The suits
are brought through Attorneys Marsh,

Dense Fog
Dense fog obscured the signal set by the first section of
the eastbound Pittsburgh-Baltimore-Buffalo Limited, causing
the second section of that train to- crash into it. A short time
later, before signalmen could flag it, the fast Twentieth Century;
Limited, westbound, crashed into the wreckage which had piled
up on the westbound track.
, Daylight had not yet appeared when the three trains piled,'
up together. Farmers and villagers hurried to the assistance of j
the passengers. The work of rescuing those pinioned under tliej
wreckage, was hampered by the darkness, which was accentu-i
ated by the fog. Ambulances, automobiles and all kinds of ve-j
hides were sent from Elyria and other points to the scene of j
the wreck. The little morgue at Amherst was soon filled with!
bodies of the dead.. Most of the injured were conveyed to hos-j
pitals at Elyria.
.The first "identified body taken from
the. wreckage was that of Rev. Gust

badly hurt on this train. Two coaches

The body of one , fireman. Daaiy

Some of the-- members of ( the crews
of the three trains involvfed in the
wreck escaped with scratches and
bruises. Search was being made for
the bodies of two express messengers
expected to be found among express
car wreckage piled twenty feet high.
Many of the dead probably will
go to their graves unidentified. Most
of those killed were -asleep in the rear
day coach of the first train of 86
at the time of the crash and had re
moved wraps and coats and other ar
ticles of identifying clothing. The
bodies of many of these scantily clad
victims are so horribly mangled that
identification will be impossible.
Some of the victims were . dismem
bered. Relief parties collected the frag
ments of three bodies those of a wo
man and two men and piled them in
discriminately in one basket. They
probably will be buried together.
The Twentieth Century proceeded
on its way to Chicago. None of the
passengers on this train was injur
ed. All of the dead and injured were on
train No. 8 6.
In a statement given out this fore
noon, I. C. Moon, general manager of
the New York Central lines at Cleve

"The rear car of the first section
was a coach from Chicago to Pitts
burgh. It had forty passengers, four
of whom were killed. I don't know
how many were injured.

CHAMBERLAIN'S
BIG AO BILL
BEFORE SENAT
Washington, March 2 9 The Cham- i
berlain army re-organization bill, a
substitute for the House army meas- i
lire, was before the Senate today as
the unfinished business. Administra- t
tion leaders will press for prompt dls- ;
position of the bill.
The bill . provides for a standing ;
army of approximately 175,000 men,
an increase of about 40,000 over the !
total proposed in the House measure.
It also provides for at Federal volun
teer force with a maximum strength '
of 260,000 and a federalized National
Guard of 280,000 men.
Senator Chamberlain was prepared
to explain the bill and open the &
bate when the Senate convaned.
