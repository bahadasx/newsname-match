has used the guard as a means to
play politics and advice certain
schemes calculated to benefit, both
himself and Governor Hunt., In fact.
Jhc direct charge of incompetence was
flung at him. -
It hah been known for some tim?j
thr.t the war department has been 1
urging the removal of Harris. Last
December Assistant Secretary of War
Breckenridge, n a letter to Governor
Hunt, stated emphatically that the re
tention of Harris was not for the bene
fit of the guard, and that Harris' atti
tude towards the war department was
one' of "poorly veiled hostility." He
alro yaid that Harris had opposed
every rule and regulation of the de
partment designed to make the guard
efficient for national service.. tn case
of need, instead of state-service. Sec
retary of War Garrison wrote GovT
ernor Hunt that "Harris is inefficient
from a federal viewpoint." '
When Trouble Started
The trouble In the Arizona National
Guard, it is charged, started when
Governor Hunt appointed Harris to
head the guard. At that time, he-was
a sergeant in C Company of Tempe.
Since hen, it is said, harmony or
efficiency has never been known in the
N. G. A. The culmination came when,
last Friday, the adjutant, general is
sued orders that all officers of Com

thus eliminated are Captain Gulley,

WASHINGTON. March 28. Assist
ant 'Secretary Roosevelt recommended
to the house naval committee today
that the United States navy be restor
ed as soon as possible to second place
among the world powers on the sea.
Answering hypothetical questions by
committee members who were inter
ested in comparing the German and
American navies, he said" the United
States could outstrip Germany in a
race for naval Supremacy. Personally
he favoredi building program this year
larger than that "recommended in the
administration's five-year proposals.
Mr. Roosevelt will complete his tes
timony tomorrow morning, and as the
final witness of its preparedness in
quiry, the committee plans to call Sec
retary Daniels tomorrow afternoon.
While the assistant secretary declin
ed to discuss naval policies, which he
said were within Secretary Daniels'
province, he gave his personal views
in advocacy of large and immediate
naval upbuilding. In case of war he
said the United States would need 223,-
000 men for its navy, judging from Eng
land's experience in her naval forces
since the war began. The administra
tion's five-year program alone, he
stated, would entail doubling the pres
ent number of men and officers.
The navy at present, Mr. Roosevelt
asserted, was (iot sufficient to cope
With a first class power, or a combin
ation of lesser powers, if the govern
ment's policy was to protect both
coasts, the Panama Canal, its outlying
possessions and maintain its national
policy with respect to Latin America.
Cheaper labor and material, he said,
enabled Germany to build and main
tain her navy at less cost than this
nation.
By delaying planning new ships to
learn lessons from the European war,
Mr. Roosevelt declared the navy had
evolved plans which would make the
new battleships as near torpedo-proof
as it is possible to make them. He
recommended the establishment of a
naval base on San Francisco bay, de
veloping the Bremerton, Wash, yard
and establishment of a marine corps
base in Southern California. He also
said a drydock and repair shops, but
not a complete navy yard, should be

Another Determined Effort
By Germans to Break
Through French Lines is
Repulsed With Heavy
Losses to the Teutons
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
Another determined effort by the Ger
mans to break through Uie French
lines northwest of Verdun has result
ed in failure and with heavy losses to
the Germans.
After days of intense artillery prep
aration for another effort to lessen
the six miles intervening between
them and the Paris-Verdun railway
and the nine miles still between them
and Verdun, the Germans launched a
great infantry attack on the Haucourt
Bethincourt sector. In successive waves
the Germans were thrown into the
fray, but all of their attempts' were
put down by the fire of the French
guns and fire of the French infantry.
There still is an intermittent bom
bardment going on northeast of Ver
dun and in the Woevre region. In the
Argonne the French are giving the
German lines no rest while in the Vos
ges the artillery action has been mark
ed on both sides.
On the British" front in tire St. Eloi
sector, the Germans opened a heavy
artillery fire on the British forces holcP
ing the German ground gained by them
Monday. The British artillery replied
effectively and according to the Brit
ish official statement, these positions
still are jn the hands of the British.
In the Pertavy region of the Rus
sian front Berlin reports that the on
slaughts of the Russians against the
German lines have been withstood and
that the attacking forces have suffered
heavy casualties.
A semi-official dispatch from Berlin
says that the Russians have attacked
in their new offensive with sixty di
visions on a front of 120 kilometers
and that their losses have been not
less than 80,000 men."
Heavy Italian bombardments of Aus
trian positions on the Doberdo Heights
and along the Isonzo continue.
A German aid squadron has dropped
bombs on the harbor works at Saloniki
and the entete allies encampment
north of Saloniki.
A German torepdo boat destroyer was
rammed and sunk by the British light
cruiser Cleopatra in 'the recent en
gagement off the German coast. There
were no German survivors.
Two more steamers have been sent to
the bottom, the Eagle Point, a British
vessel, presumably by a torpedo, and
the Harriet, a Danish vessel, by a mine.
The crews of both vessels were saved.
The unity and solidarity of the en
tente allies and the decision "to con
tinue the struggle to victory for the
common cause" were reaffirmed in res
olutions adopted by the conference of
the allies in Paris.
French Repulse Attacks
PARIS, March 28. A bombardment
of great violenie against the French
positions from Avoeourt to Llethin
court, west of the Meuse, was fol
lowed this afternoon by a German at
tack which was launched against the
Haucourt Malancourt front in sue
cessive waves. x It was repulsed with
very heavy losses, according to the
official statement issued by the
French war office.
The conference of the entente allies
which ended tonight adopted the fol
lowing resolutions:
"The representatives of the allied
governments, in conference at Paris
March 27 and 28. 1916, affirm the

General Situation Is Coin

Been Torpedoed
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, March 28. Secre
tary Lansing with the approval of
President Wilson, has instructed Am
bassador Gerard at Berlin to inquire
of Germany whether any of its sub
marines torpedoed the British Chan
nel steamer Sussex, upon which 25
American citizens were traveling, or
the British horseship Englishman,
which went down with a loss of one
American life.
As the situation now stands, the
United States has no conclusive proof
that a submarine atacked either ship,
but all evidence' at hand indicates
that both were torpedoed without
warning. Upon the response of the
Berlin foreign office to Mr. Gerard's
inquiry may depend the next step of
the American government.
A this time it is made clear that
no action lias been taken which in
any sense may be construed as a de
mand or a protest. 1
President Wilson laid all the sfJte
departments reports on the subfect
before bis cabinet today. It was after
the meeting that Secretary Lansing
allowel it to become, known that it
had been determined to make an in
qjjiry of the German government.
Later it wa learned that instructions
already had been forwarded to Am
bassador Gerard. They probably
were in his possession this' afternoon.
-The general situation was compli
catd still fuither tonight with the
receipt, of a dispatch from Consul j
Frost at Queenstown. announcing that
the British steamer Manchester En
gineer had been torpedoed without
warning. Two American negro citi
zens who were aboard were rescued.
Further information which the con
sul said he was forwarding will be
awaited before the department under
takes to. consider this case.
If a German submarine attacked
either the Sussex or the Englishman
it is admitted that the resultant sit
uation will be most serious. An un
official but authoritative statement
has been made that Germany, if it
was found that one of her submarines
torpedoed the Sussex, immediately
would offer reparation, punish the
subnvirine commander and take steps
to satisfy the United States that the
act was a violation of instructions.
While official expression of opinion
was withheld, it was intimated that
should such a development occur, the
position rf the United States would
not be defined until it was known
that the men responsible for violating
the rights of humanity, the principles
of international law and the solemn
asrurances given by Germany actually
had teen 'punished.
If further developments should
cause the president to determine that
the breaking off of diplomatic rela
tions with Germany was necessary,
he would go before congress, announce
his decision, and explain the acts
leading up to it.
While the president has full author
ity to break off relations, he realizes
that such nn act almost inevitably
would lead to war, and therefore
would feel himself obligated fully to
inform congress, the war making body
of the government, before taking such
a step.
Among high officials of the admin
istration there appears to he a differ
ence of opinion regarding the course
the United States should pursue
should Germany, deny responsibility
for the attacks and the American gov
ernment find convincing evidence that
they were the work of German sub
marines. . Some officials believe that
in such circumstances the accumu
lation of. offences, against the United
States would' justify the severence of
diplomatic relations. Others do not
feel that such an action would be
justified

FULL INVESTIGATION OF

Republican A. P. Leased Wire ,
WASHINGTON, March 28. A full1
investigation of the circumstances of
the raid on Columbus, N. M. by Villa
and his bandits has been ordered by
the war department. General Funston
has been directed to take the matter
up as soon as Colonel Slocum, com
manding the Thirteenth cavalry and
such of his men as took-part in re
pulsing the bandit, return from
Mexico.
So far the department has no offi
cial report of what took place except
for brief telegraphic dispatches. The
officers and men of the Thirteenth
cavalry have been too busy with the
pursuit of Villa for appearance be-
Lfore a court of inquiry. The orders
to General Funston became known to
night when abstracts of Secretary
Baker's report were before the house
appropriations committee in connec
tion with the emergency $8,000,000 ap
propriation bill became available.
The appropriation bill provides for
24 additional aeroplanes among other
things. In this connection Mr. Baker
said : .
"Therev is no present intention of
buying 24 machines. The first thing
will be to buy eight machines and
experiment with " them to get the
best type we can of those that have
been developed for Kuropean service.
General- Funston thinks that he
should have eight machines in addi
tion to these the has now. They will
be used on scout duties.

period.
The one hoite at present is that the
American cavalry men may be able
to catch up with Villa before he gets
much further south. It is admitted
here tl.at the hope is very slender
and will be much more attenuated if
the American troops are not given
the use of the Mexican railroads for
the bringing of supplies. The sup
plies question overshadows everything
else now. Army officers here say
that upon its solution depends every
chance of a successful termination to
the Mexican invasion.
MILLIONS FOR
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, March 28. Diplo
matic and domestic aspects of the
Mexican problem overshadowed its
military side here tonight, official re
ports from General Funston disclosing
no change in the situation on the
border or in Mexico. Congress rushed
through an -emergency appropriation
of $8.Cn.r)fl2 to pay for the pursuit of
the bandits, and the state department
prepared to press General Carranza
for permission to use Mexican rail
roads to solve the troops supply
problem.
Fears expressed in press reports
from the border that failure to oh
tain use of the railroad might ser
iously hamper the pursuit of Villa
were not expressed at the state or
war departments.
The communication to General Car
ranza will he made through special
Representative Rodgers, at Quareta

ward tonight. State department offi
cials said it seemed necessary to press
upon the de facto government the
need for special consideration of the
request to use the lines south from
the border without awaiting the per
fecting of the protocol under negoti
ation. While it was stated there was
no question that the expedition after
Villa would press on and that a suf
ficient amount of supplies could be
furnished to the troops by motor
the general use of the lines would
greatly simplify matters.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas.. March 28.
Confirmation that General Persh
ing already has been using a portion
of the Northwestern railroad for trans
portation of troops was secured by
General Funston today from what
was said to 'be an -of fietar -swtirce.
This information included a report
of the overturning of two cars and
the injuring of ten troopers of tha
Tenth cavalry and several horses. ;
Three of the men were reported seri
ously injured.
The accident occurred while the
cars were being taken over a "shoo
fly" that had been built around the
Cumber tunnel south of Casas. Gran
des. One of the rails gave way and
the cars rolled down an embankment.
No reports from General Pershing
were received today, but his silence
caused no unexginess at headquarters
where the chief concern continued to
be. the problem of getting supplies
into Mexico without a railroad.
Exactly where Colonel Dodd's cav-
altry is now, or into how- many de
tachments it has been divided, was
unknown at General Funston's head
quarters.
The exact whereabouts of General
Pershing also remained unreported
but this lack of information created
no uneasiness, for General Pershing
still has orders to work out his own
problems.
Full realization of the danger into
which some of the advanced detach
ments must be moving was acknowl
edged. 'illa's known ability ,as a di
rector of ambuscades has aroused
frank expressions of fear among arm
officers that he may catch some of
the American troops in a mountain
trap.
Openly expressed pessimism as to
an early capture of Villa now is fre
quently heard. Unless checked by the
forces of the de facto government, or
unless he himself decides to turn and
fight, there appeared no reason today
vhy the chase should cease until Villa
had led the Americans through twist
ing mountain trails and over water
less wastes for another 300 miies and
more.
More auto trucks have been asked
for by General Funston and when
they are placed in service there will
be a few more than 300 along the
different lines of communication.
