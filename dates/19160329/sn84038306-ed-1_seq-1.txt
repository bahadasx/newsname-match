the Cuban man thinks this a mark of
beauty. The ladies wear beautiful
gowns and the number of diamonds
thev wear far exceed those of the
states, going to the opera many ladies
will wear as high as $60,000 worth of
diamonds leaving as many at home.
It is said there are more millionaires
here in the city of Havana than any
city in the world twice its size.
About the first thing a visitor does
is to walk down the Prado which is
a wide asphalt boulevard with- a
"beautiful wide parklet through its
center where people stroll. It is some
times spoken of as a series of small
parks with a boulevard on both sides.
The Prado extends a distance of two
miles and is shaded on both sides by
the deep green laurel trees and the
graceful palms. All along the Prado
among the tree, shrubs and flowers are
seats and benches. On both sides of
the boulevards are some of the beauti
ful homes and clubs. During the day
it is filled with carriages and automo
biles and people but in the evening
after the lights are on it is a moving
mass of pleasure seekers. There isn't
a noisier, more lively place in the
