You Need a Car
Henderson About It
Here Is a new automobile atory
showing the I'endleton spirit. It was
told lost night at a Knights of Pythias
meeting? in Milton by J. H. Gwlnn In
explaining how a local party of 10
mad a fraternal visit to the Milton
lodge.
"We were so enthusiastic over the
prospect of visiting Milton that we did
not have enough cars for the crowd.
Dr. T. M. Henderaon arrived on the
scene Just then and wua told of the
predicament. 'I will go buy one,' he
la auid to have replied. Whereupon
he disappeared fur a few minutes and
then returned driving a big six cylin
der Frankln purchased during the
Interim."
The visit by the local Pythluna last
evening was one of a series of Jaunts
to neighboring towns being made this
year In lieu of holding a district con
vention here. I. E. Young, district
deputy, was with the party making
n offtrial visit to the Milton lodge. A
banquet was served by the Milton

Wheat Crop Will
be Light in All
the Middle States
That the middle states will have a
light wheat crop this year Is the view
of Dr. C. J. Smith, who has Just re
turned from an extended trip east
and visited In Ohio, Illinois, Minneso
ta and Nebraska en route home. The
doctor says that the seed this year
was poor because of having been
damaged by ruins last summer. Con
sequently much of the grain has not
germinated. On some places he visit
ed the owners do not expect to get
half n crop and are considering seed
ing the ground to some other crop.
He says the acreage Is also less than
last year.

Sinnott Induces
to Increase the
Given Oregon School Fund
Through the efforts of Congress
man S nnott the house public land
committee was induced yesterday to
raise the percentage of land grant
money to go to the school fund from
10 per cent to 20 per cent, the am.
ount going to western Oregon coun
ties for road purposes being reduced
from 10 to 30 per cent.
The following report from Wash
ington tella of the action in the house
committee yesterday.
The house public lands committee
in executive session this afternoon
fixed the proportions of the proceeds
of the Oregon and California grant
lands at 20 per cent to the state for
schools. 30 for land grant counties
for roads, 4(1 for the general recla
mation fund arid 10 for the federal
government.
This division was made after Con
gressman Sinnott of Oregon, made re
peated efforts to enlarge benefits fof
the state.
Amendment Voted Down.
The committee first voted down an
amendment giving 40-10 to state and
counties; then 30-30. then 25-25.
Mr. Sinnott then offered an amend
ment requiring the reclamation share
to he used on Oregon projecta.
This was defeated, and a like fate
met an amendment requiring that
balf the reclamation share be spent
in the Btate.
Oregon's Claims Set Forth.
Mr. Sinnott spoke for an hour, set
ting forth the claims of Oregon schools
to a large share of the funds. He de.
clared the state had suffered Incalcu
lable damage, that the government
long ago decided this land for the
benefit of the people of Oregon and
should not take away benefits merely
because the railroad has defeated th
original terms.
Mr. McArlhur also secured a hear
ing before final action and spoke for
n larger school fund, backing up Mr.
S'nnott's position.
Half of Proceeds to State.
The committee was strongly set on
allowing no more than half the pro
ceeds to Oregon and Insisted on n 20
30 division over Oregon's protest.
Mr. Lenroot declared that the coun
ties are entitled to the greatest share
because they are directly affected by
the delayd settlement.
Mr. Sinnott trid unsuccessfully to
Increase the timber allowance on
land classed as agricultural from 300,
000 feet to 500,000 on each forty acre
tract.
The full committee made no chang
es of importance In the sub'-commit-tee's
draft, aside from the division of
the proceeds to the state and striking
out all reference to executory con
tracts.
Committee

John lind Contract Feared.
The last action was by a vote of
nine to seven and was based on a fear
that the John Lind contract would

Ritner Files For
Reelection; to Run
Upon His Record
RITNER AUTHOR OF MEASURE
MAKINGG EASTERN ORE
GON A PUBLIC SERIVCE
DISTRICT.
Roy W. Ritner. who represented
Umatilla county In the last legisla
ture, today filed with the county clerk
the declaration of his candidacy for
e-election as representative.
Mr. Ritner states that he will de
pend on the record he made at the
last session for the support of the
voters of the county. He introduced
only three bills at the last session,
all of which were enacted into laws.
The most Important or these was the
bill making eastern Oregon a separ
ate public utility district, thereby giv
ing this section of the state represen
tation on the commission. He also
introduced the bill extending the
county library system to all the coun
ties of the state and making it pos
sible to build branch county libraries.
The bill which reorganized the state
fish and game commission was also
drawn by him.
Mr. Ritner states that if elected
again he will favor such economy as
is consistent with the proper admin
istration of the affairs of the state
and the maintenance of the state In
stitutions. The only measure he has
in view is the revision of the state
road laws so that they can be inter
preted and executed. The present
laws are very conflicting.
The annual convention of tho
county judges and commissioners at
their last session appointed a commit
tee to revise the road laws and they
are now hard at work on the revision.
He is also in favor or Incorporating
In the road laws a provision allowing
the county court to reduce the width
of established roads from 60 to 40
feet. There are many roads which
are now much too wide and by mak
ing them 40 feet wide the extra ten
feet on each side could be placed un
der cultivation This would not apply
to the main trunk roads or roads used
by the stockmen in driving cattle or
sheep to and from summer range
Mr. Ritner is a strong supporter of
R. N. Stanfield tor speaker and is at
present handling his campaign for
that position.

EL PASO, March 2. Dodd's ca
ratry was reported at Madera today
developing a new phase of the hunt.
It is understood he shifted his head
quarters from Elvalle. Cooperating
with the Carranxistas he will throw
cut detachments and form a ring
around the territory where Villa Is
supposedly hiding The ring gradu
ally will become smaller til the ban
dit is forced to fight. Cloaked with
full authority, Pershing is believed
acting without consulting- with head
quarters at San Antonio.
A peaceful solution of our relations
with Mexico seemed nearer today
than s nee the Columbus raid. The
failure of attempts on both sides of
the border to make the expedition ap
pear like intervention has pleased of
ficials. They do not doubt the rumor
that factories had started stories
about threatened uprisings and racial
antagonisms Villa's inflammatory
speeches and articles published in
Mexican newspapers near the border
alike were unsuccessful
Villa told the peons that the Am.
ericans intended to massacre and
burn and that the negro troopers ate
children. After fleeing, some of the
Peons returned, reassured when the
troops .offered to pay liberally for
their food. Practically the only con
verts to Villa's cause has been made
at the muzzle of rifles.
Carranxa.' cooperation is becoming
more pronounced. Bavlra and Gar
cia both declared emphatically today
that the pursuit of Villa will be prose
cuted vigorously. Garcia said: "I can
say officially that Carranxa Is anxious
for Villa's capture and destruction.
He regards Villa as a menace to Mex
ican liberty."
