"THE IIRTH OF A HATIOH"
COMING HERE IN APRIL
Messrs. Judy St Gay, Lessees of
Tho Tabb Theatre, have secured at
very great expense tho greatest of
all shows, "Tho Birth of a Nation."
This production has been taking the
entire country by storm and. is con
sidered the greatest thing ever at
tempted in the amusement line. Mt.
Sterling should feel proud to show
a production of this kind ns many
towns twice the. size of it have bees
turned down. It sh6uld prove to be
the greatest advertisement that our
little city could get. The spectacle
will be hero for two days, April
17th and 18thi, with n matinee each
day nH 3:15. This istho same com
pany that placed fLoufsvillo and
Lexington and will have the same
p50 piece orchestra.

genuine regret.

MAGISTRATES
FINISH TERMS
Says Court of Appeals In Knocking
Out Act of 1914 on a Technicality.
In 1913 tho people of Montgom
ery county by a majdrjty of over
one thousand, adopted tho commis
sion form of( government under the
Act of 1892.. Under it the chnnge
did not. become effective until Jan
uary 1918, and with a view of car
rying into effect tho will of tho poo
plo sooner, our then Representa
tive, Hon. John A. Judy introduced
and had unanimously adopted by
tho Legislature of1914. an Art
authorizing the selection of Com
missioners in 1915 to take office in
1910 and under this act Messrs. A.
L. Tipton, 0. W. McCormick and
C. L. Dean were chosen. That this
system is a vast improvement over
the old is evidenced by tho fact that
in less than sixty days the Commis
sioners saved tho pcoplo over $500
by rigid economy and improved bus
iness methods. Doubt, however,
was expressed as to tho constitu
tionality of tho Act of 1914, al
though there were a largo number
of able lawyers in both the House
and Senate when it was adopted.
Judge A. A. Hazelrigg, as a taxpay
er, brought an agreed suit against
C. T. Hazelrigg, County Treasurer,
seeking to enjoin him from paying
any claim allowed by the Commis
sioners, This was granted by
Judge Young on the ground that the
act did not comply with tho consti
tutional provision' "which requires
that the section to be amended by
nn net must bo set out in full. This
ruling was last Friday upheld by
tho Court of Appeals. A question
was also raised as to whether the
' old 'law of 1892 violates tho consti
tution by requiring that tho Com
missioners be elected from three
districts by tho voters of tho whole
county, instead of being- selected
.from tho county at large. Judge
Young was of tho opinion it did, but
the Court of Appenls said that
while tho language of tho constitu
tion would indicnto an intention
that the county should not bo dis
tricted for election to tho Fiscal
Court, the General Assembly in
1892, immediately after its adop
tion, ennctcd a law providing for
election of members of the Fiscal
Court from districts, and it never
had been questioned, nor is thero
anything in tho debates on tho con
stitution to throw light on tho in
tent. Tho construction placed upon
it by tho act of tho General Apsem
bly does no violence to a reasonable
interpretation of tho constitutional
provision; so tho court decided that
tho county may bo divided into dis
tricts, ns was done here.
Under this ruling Commissioners
cannot legally bo elected until next
yonr (to take ofllco in January,
1918) and tho court will bo com
posed until then of tho County
Judge and tho Magistrates. At the
samo timo tho counties of Jefferson,
MeCrackcn and Bell will nlso elect
Commissioncis.

MORE BRICK STREETS
Owing to tho financial condition
of the city it is impossible for tho
streets to be put in first class re
pair and it is rumored that several
streets will be improved this sum
mer by ordering snmc bricked or
improved by similar methods. When
the first streets of the abovo char
acter were built in' this city thero
was considerable opposition to them.
However, since, that time a number
of those who opposed brick streets
are now warm advocates of this
method of improvement.
