CLEVELAND, Ohio, March 29.—
Three crack New York Central trains,
one of them the Twentieth Century
Limited, crashed together in a thick
fog one mile west of Amherst. Ohio,
today. At least fifteen persons were
killed outright and thirty persons In
jured, some of them fatally.
AJl of the dead and Injured were
passengers of the first section of the
east bound train number 86, New
York Central official stated. If the
coaches had not been steel, C. S.
Goodwin, of the New Tork Central
stated, the loss of life would have
been much greater.
Eight identified dead bodies have
been removed from the wreckage. A.
W. Baetz, an Amherst undertaker at
the scene of the disaster, said he saw
sixteen dead persons carried from the.
smashed coaches. Goodwin admitted
that ten or twelve passengers were
killed and that thirty were Injured so
badly they b»d to be taken to hos
pitals.
According to stories told by pas
sengers, the first section of number
86, east bound, had just slowed up
ready to stop, when a block signal
was thrown against it, one mile west
of Amherst. The second section of
number 86, bound from Detroit to
Pittsburgh, crashed into the rear of
the first section less than two min
utes later. A brakeman had been
sent back with a lantern and fuses
to warn the second section.' Passen
gers stated it was so dark the engi
neer of the trailer did not see the
warning light
It was also reported the first sec
tion of train number 86 had slowed
up or stopped awaiting orders be
cause of the heavy fog, so dense that
the headlights were dimmed.
The second section crashed clear
through a bufTet car and a day coach
on the first section, throwing the
wreckage upon the next track. In
lees than a minute the Twentieth Cen
tury limited was derailed, the engine
ploughing through three hundred
rards of tracks, but no passengers
on the Century were hurt.
Most of the dead and injured were
rushed to Memorial hospital at Elyria,
five miles from the wreck at 6:30 a.
m. Ambulances, rushed from Lorain,
Amherst and Elyria, stuck in the
mud.
The sound of the crash and the
cries of the injured and dying were
heard two miles away.
Twenty-aeven Killed.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, March 29.—
Twenty-seven lives were snuffed out,
and forty-three persons were Injured,
some fatally, when three crack New
York Central trains smashed up in
pitch darkness near Amherst, thirty
two mlleq west of Cleveland, at 3:15
a. m. today. Twenty-three bodies
were In the morgue at Amherst, two

coaches were overturned like chil
dren's toy trains. I helped the rest
of our bo
ye pull twenty women and
men from car windows."
This speedy work by firemen saved
many passengers from cremation.
R. D. Turner, fireman on the first
section of No. 86, said:
"There was such a fog that we
couldn't see sixty feet in front of us.
I don't know whether Hess (the en
gineer of the second section) saw his
signals or not. I don't see how he
could. There was a crash and the
whole train seemed to buckle up."
Frank Provost, New York salesman,
who was in a sleeper on the first
section, told this story:
'U was asleep when it happened. 1
was hurled partly through the car
window. Before I $ould realize what
had'happened, the second crash came
when the Twentieth Century, running
a few feet from us hit our wreckage.
"Men and women in night clothes,
were scrambling about, dazed. I heard
cries, groans and screams. One man
prayed aloud. I yelled wildly for
everybody to 'get up,' but they were
already up—they had been tossed up
bodily."
There are six tracks and two
switches at the point where the wreck
occurred. Traffic was blocked over
two hours.
The day coach on the first section
of train No. 86, the second last car of
the train, was the "death car." The
steel Pullman crumpled up under the
impact of the great engine pulling the
second section.
Legs and arms of victims were
picked up In the debris. Shoes, hats,
women's apparel of aU sorts were
strewn all about.
Undertakers said the bodies of
some of the dead could never be put
together.
G. W. Kershaw, of Summltville, N.
J., told this story:
"I was in the second coach from the
one that was sfnashed so badly. It
was the most ghastly sight I ever
saw. As I left the car I saw a man
pick up a leg. Another man approach
ed me, carrying a bundle done up in
a sheet. 'What shall I do with this
bundle?' he aslted a train man. "What's
in It?' the train man asked. 'Arms
and legs,' was the reply. Another
survivor came In. He said the crash
hurled him through a window and as
he landed, something hit him. It was
hie suit case."
Other survivors who told thrilling
stories were T. M. Weber, of Atlanta,
Ga. A. ©omensky, Pittsburgh
Charles Harris, Chicago, and W. G.
Manley, Washington, D. C.
Remnants of the bodies of a man
and woman 'were found on the pilot of
the second section of No. 86.
All of the dead and Injured were
passengers of east bound train No. 86,
which was running in two sections.
The second section, running at thirty
miles an hour, plunged into the rear
of the first section, ploughing through
two eteel coaches.
One minute later, the Twentieth
Century limited, the fastest train in

York, running sixty miles an hour,

coaches of the three trains were of

into junk. Only three of the eight
cars of the Twentieth Century limited
remained on the track. 'Both sections
of No. 86 were bound from Chicago
to Pittsburgh.
The crumpled day coach of the first
section of No. 86 was the death car.
The engine of the second division of
No. 86 ploughed through a buffet car,

The exact cauefe of the wreck is un
known. The first section of No. 86
slowed up or stopped a quarter of a

a blinding fog, awaiting orders. The
second section of No. 86, shot forward
at undiminished speed, although It
was running only a couple of miles

Three Trains In Smash.
CLEJVEJLAiND, Ohio, March 29.—The
Twentieth Century Limited west
bound and two Lake Shore trains,
east bound, collided early today at
Amherst, Ohio, thirty-seven miles
west of Cleveland.
According to a statement Issued by
the New York Central at 8 o'clock,
four persons are known to be dead
and two persons, a mall clerk and
porter, are Injured. Unofficial re
ports said sixteen bodies had been
taken from the wreckage and that the
injured numbered two score.
The wreok occurred in a thick fog.
The rear section of train number 86,
east bound, ran Into the first section.
A few minutes later the Twentieth
Century limited, going west, ploughed
through the two wrecked trains.
Three cars were totally demolished,
and all the cars thrown from the track.
One engine which stayed on the
track managed to clear with one car,

EL PASO, Texas, March 29.—A
peaceful solution of the relations be
tween the United States and Mexico
seemed nearer today than at any time
since the Villista raid on Columbus,
N. M., Maroh 9, which was followed
within a week by the American puni
tive expedition.
Failure of an organized attempt on
both sides of the border to transform
the campaign against bandits into in
tervention, pleased both American
and Carranza officials here. They lit
tle doubted that a "rumor factory"
maintained in El Paso and other bor
der points started reports of threat
ened Mexican uprisings and racial
antagonisms to Inflame both sides and
compel Intervention.
United States army officers pointed
to the 'Very friendly reception given
the expeditionary forces In Mexico.
Villa has so far failed to rouse the
peons against the gringoes, despite
his speeches that the American troops
were coming to massacre and burn.
He told the Mexicans that the United
'States negro troops ate children.
Some Mexicans first fled In terror
at the approach of the expedition's
vanguard, but returned when thaj
found the soldiers friendly and will
ing to pay good prices for supplies.
Mexican papers In border cities also
failed to Inflame the peons. Practical
ly the only accessions to Villa's forces
have been secured at the rifle point.
Carranza co-operation to date has
been pronounced. While .some vexing
problems remain to be"~settled be
tween the two governments, principal
ly the free use of the Mexican rail
ways by the American expedition,
both sides here today were confident
of a speedy adjustment.
The pursuit of villa was being car
ried on today behind an official sil
ence on the part of the authorities
here regarding his exact whereabouts.
It seemed certain that Villa reached
the mountains in southern Chihuahua
while the American troops were
forced to advance slowly on aiccount
of danger to their line of communica
tions. The vanguard is now moving
over dreary mountains which offer
even greater obstacles to rapid prog
ress than the desert between Colum
