After some more discussion of the
Insurance situation, Mr. Strauss spoke
of the grain and live stock situation,
saying that a means of disposing of
the livestock had been provided by
the promise of ths establishmsnt of
a packing house at Orangeburg,
which would consume all of the hogs
that the farmere could raise for
market.
Hs also advised other forms of di?
versification and that the farmere in
a community organise into coopera?
tive organisations fpr ths selling of
their surplus products, assuring; them
of the advantages of such an arrange?
ment.

SHACKLETON'S EXPEDITION.
Wireless From Explorer Says Vessel
is Damaged.
Melbourne, March 24.?The auxil?
iary ship Aurora, of the Shackleton
Antarctic expedition, has been dam?
aged and to proceeding to New Zea?
land for repairs, according to a wire?
less dispatch from the vessel receiv?
ed by the navy department there yes?
terday.
Four members of the Aurora's party
were left behind at the Ross Sea base
of the expedition.
It is evident from the Aurora's wire?
less dispatch that the fate of Lieut.
Sir Ernest Shackleton and the rest of
the party, which is attempting to
cross tho Antarctic region is yet un
know. Probably nothing will be
heard from them until next Novem?
ber, when the lee breaks.
The wireless dispatch says the
Aurora was released from the ice In
Ross Sea on March 14, In latitude
64.30 south, and longitude 161 east
The Aurora reported it had sent wire
lees messages for a relief ship dur?
ing the winter, but its calls had not
been answered. This is believed to
have been due to the abandonment
by the Australian government of
I Macquarle Island as a wireless sta?
tion.
I J. A. Jensen, minister of the navy,
has received the following wireless
from the Aurora:
"Hull severely strained. Ship re?
leasing from Ice March 14. latitude
64.30 south, longitude 161 east. Drift
five hundred miles.
"Gase, commissariat officer, Rich?
ards, physicist; Hay ward, secretary,
and Jack, biologist, ashore.
Wireless appeals for relief ship
sent during winter. No acknowledg?
ment.
"Ship proceeding to port Chalmers,
New Zealand, with Jury rudder. No
anchor and short of fuel. Expect to
arrive early in April.

ENTENTE OPPOSES CHAISE.
REFUSE AGREEMENT TO DISARM
MERCHANTMEN.
Formal Response to American Pro?
posal for Modus Vivendi as Already
Indicated.
Washington. March 24.?All the en?
tente powers through their embassies
here have landed to Secretary; Lan?
sing formal responses rejecting ths
State department's proposal that they
enter into a modus vivendi and dis?
arm merchant ships with the under?
standing that the United States would
endeavor to get from the central1
powers a pledge not to attack any
such unarmed ships without warn?
ing and without providing for the
safety of the passengers and crew.
Soon after the proposition was
broached officials of the entente
powers indicated their decided oppoi
tion. It was generally believed here
that this unanimous expreeSlon of
disapproval inspired the German gov?
ernment to promulgate the new ord
which is now in force, fur attacks
without warning by submarine com?
manders on any armed belligerent
merchantman.
While Secretary Lansing said today
he had not had an opportunity to
consider the replies, It is known that,
though based upon different lines of
reasoning, each of the entente powers
hue declined the proposal. The na?
ture of the objections' was. indicated
in the unofficial statements of various
officials when the American memo?
randum was submitted.
It was contended in the unofficial
discussions that Germany's alleged
contempt for treaties had made it un?
safe to rely upon any German pledge
or undertaking not to attack a mer?
chant ship without warning. The
fundamental objection urged, how?
ever, was that' there should be no
change in the principles of interna?
tional law during the progress Of hos?
tilities such as would be involved in
the acceptance of the modus vivendi
at this time, .
Some officials, of the allies hays
hsld that any attempt by the United
States to change the limitations upon
the extent of the defensive armament
which a merchant ship may carry
would be violative of the spirit, of
neutrality and might Justify the allies
In removing their shipping complete?
ly from American waters, trusting to
nearby Canadian ports for the facili?
ties necessary to loading the muni?
tions of war, and the raw material'of
American origin required by the al?
lies. It is not known whether any
suggestion, of this kind is contained
ment may consider carrying out the
idea advanced in the circular or
memorandum of limiting access to
American ports to vessels which* In
the Judgment of the United States
government, msy not be used offen?
sively against an enemy.
GOVERNOR AND STAFF INVITED.
Their Presence Is Desired at Mecklen?
burg Celebration In Charlotte on
May 20.
Columbia, March 26.?Gov. Man?
ning and his staff have been invited
by W. U Kirkpatrick, mayor of Char?
lotte, to attend the 141st anniversary
of the Mecklenburg declaration of in?
dependence In that city May 20. Pres?
ident Wilson will probably be the
guest of honor. Military features will
be stressed.
INCREASE TAXABLE PROPERTY.
Refunding of Brown Consols Brings
Large Gain.
Columbia, March 25.?The signing
of the $4,731,720 bonds and certifi?
cates of stock issued by the sinking
fund commission for the retirement of
previous State bonds will be com*
pleted today. There are 4,008 cou?
pon bonds of $1,000 each and two
stock certificates, one for $723,595.67
and the other for $124.32. At a lato
hour yesterday there remained only
about 600 bonds to be Blgned.
By tho Issuing of these bonds $5,
022,745.97 of previous bonds will be
retired. The difference represents the
assets of the sinking fund commis?
sion, which has retired an aggregate
of about $891,000 In bonds.
The new bonds, which will bo dis?
posed of in Charleston, Columbia.
New York and Richmond, are exempt
from State, county and municipal
taxation. They are not allowed, how?
ever, to be deducted from capital
stock of corporations holding them;
In this way approximately $1,500,000
will be added to the taxable property
of the State, as the other bonds al?
lowed this exemption.
RAISING FUND FOR NEEDY.
City Ldkely to Take Care of Situation
Without Asking Aid.
Augusta, Ga., March 24.?Augusta
is rapidly returning to normal after
the big fire of Wednesday night. The
relief work through a public welfare
committee has been thoroughly sys?
tematized, and over $20,000 has been
raised to care for those in distress.
Last night forty tents were placed
In May Park with over 200 cots and
not a single one was occupied, the
relatives and friends of homeless peo?
ple having taken them in temporar?
ily.
Augusta had decided that if $50,000
will be sufficient for relief work that
the city will take care of the situation
herself and not ask for outside aid.
The relief fund is growing rapidly.
Congressman Vinsons* offer to at?
tempt to secure federal assistance
was declined. Mayor Littleton ex?
pressing the appreciation of the city,
but stating that he did not think the
money would be necessary.
