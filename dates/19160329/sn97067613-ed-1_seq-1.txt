BASKET BALL
Six
Peoples Academy 25; Stowe High 20.
Hundred People Witness Game.
Imagine over six hundred excited fans
crowded into the local gymnasium, be
tween two and three hundred of whom
were visitors, and two of the fastest
teams in the state, one of which was
contending for the state championship,
playing inside of ropes, improvised to ae
commodate the overflow, and you have
the setting for the most exciting, the
fastest and also the cleanest basket ball
game ever witnessed in Morrisville. Such
was the game between Stowe High and
Peoples Academy last Friday night, to
have won which might have given Stowe
the championship.
While P. A. would have liked to have
seen the championship come to La
moille County, they were bound to win
from' their old rivals and the game was
contested stubbornly inch by ineh, with
the locals having just a shade the best of
it most of the time. Stowe got the first
blood, when Heath threw a foul and fol
lowed it closely with a clean basket from
the floor. Next the locals secured five
points and Stowe two more, tying the
score, Silloway being the star performer
for P. A. in this halt, playing a whirl
wind game. The score did not vary
more than five points throughout the
game and a tie score seemed probable.
Each team scored 10 points in the last
period, P. A.'s five to the good at the
close of the first period, saving the day.
Their grand finish in the last five min
utes of play,however, was characteristic,
their team work at this point being a
fine exhibition. Very little individual
work was noticable in the P. A. line-up,
the quintet again proving itself a team
of fast, clean players, who have that
reputation among the other teams in the
league.
Heath, a saenior, ana the stowe squads
only veteran, did Stellar work for the vis
tors and was ably supported by a bunch
of players, who have earned well second
position in the league. They sure are
husky bunch, fully as heavy as the P. A
five and every man was same until the
ast minute.

Notes
The game was friendly throughout
and was followed by a reception to the
visitors at Academy hall, which was
much enjoyed by a large number,
Seventy-six were present from Hard-
wick, coming down in a special. As
body they were"supposedtobe neutral,"
but of course, personally, many had their
preference and their sentiments could not
be entirely suppressed.
Nearly 150 loyal and enthusiastic
rooters were present from Stowe. There
would haye been more but for the fact
that the traction engine was out of com
mission, ihe last team did not arrive
until nine o'clock and the game was held
until their arrival.
Also Johnson and Hyde Park were well
represented.

Red
Sox Defeated by Alpha
Sigma Phi, 26 to 14
Last Monday night the locals lost their
first game at home in a hard fought bat
tle. Those Middlebury huskies out
classed the Sox, but were forced to fight
every minute.
The first period was close throughout.
The guards of both teams played clever
ball and forced a majority of the baskets
to be made from long shots. U. Parker
was the first to cage the ball after nine
minutes of play. This was followed by
one from A. Parker and then the locals
awoke and secured tbeir share during
the remainder of the period. The period
ended 13 to 12 in favor of ihe Sox.
The visitors played their game in the
last period, securing 14 points to the ,
Red's 1. The line-up:
