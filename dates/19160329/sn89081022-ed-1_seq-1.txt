O Estrem, and Attorney Charles John
son was elected chairman The nomi
nation for Mayor found the present en
cumbent renominated without opposi
tion A stiff fight for the nomination

a great extent Hans Gunderson, the
piesent holdei of the office and James
Sandeison weie nominated The result
of the ballots cast found Gunderson in
the lead, the vote being 121 to 97.
Hon W Odell was the unanimous
choice for the office of treasurer. John
Feig was tenominated for assessor, a
place he filled in such splendid fashion
last ear, but after a %ote was taken,
and he declared unanimously elected, he
stated that for other reasons he would
be unable to accept the place again this
veai James Sanderson, A O Sather
and A Erickson were then put up
for the office A lesult of the balloting
showed the former leading the field with
119 votes out of 207 cast For the of
fice of constable, Alfied Gilbertson and
O estgard, piesent holders of the
offices, weie lenominated
This concluded the work of the city
caucus, and the chairman appointed the
same committee, composed of Messrs
O Estrem W Blomquist,
\V ler and John A Johnson.
The First Ward had a quiet time, no
contests being on for either alderman
or justice, Olson and J£ Rykken
beiner chosen for the respective offices.
In the Second Ward, W Kent, John
Dale, Millard and A Hedin were
nominated for alderman On the first
ballot, Kent had 34, Dale 9, Millard 39
and Hedin 11 votes On the second bal
lot, Millard was elected by a vote of
44 to Kent 23 The second ward will
boast without a doubt of the youngest
Justice of the Peace, in the person of
Homer Chase, who was nominated
for the place by acclamation.
The Third Ward also had a contest
foi the aldermanic nomination Sam
Rasmusson, Simons and A.
Ber^eson were nominated, and the form
ei was nominated on the first ballot, the
vote being 21, 8 for Simons and 7 for
Ber^eson O A Grangard had no op
position for the office of justice.
Moie competition enlivened the ac
tivities of the Fourth Ward meeting.
Andrew Bjorsell and A. Erickson
were the nominees, and the result of the
balloting found the former leading by
a vote of 29 to 22. Oscar A. Fridlund
was chosen Justice of the Peace.
Voteis in the Third and Fourth Wards
will, however, have a chance to vote for
others than the caucus nominees.
Simons has filed for alderman from
the Third Ward and A. Erickson
trom the Fourth, and thus it is made
an incentive for voters from each of
these wards to turn out at the polls
next Tuesday It is practically certain
that a larger number of votes will be
cast this year than at any recent prev
ious election of city officials.
In the First Ward I. T. Cramer wan*
on the ballot by petition for Justice, Mr.
Rykken not caring for the position.

O I A
MRS ERICK PAULSON.
Mrs. Johanna Lundborg Paulson, pio
neer woman of county, and a Burvivor
of West Lake Massacre of 1862, died at
the home of her daughter, Mrs. Martin
Quamme, in township of Kerkhoven, on
Monday, March 20, after being ill for
about four weeks She has, however,
been failing in health for several years.
She was born December 21, 1848, at
Skofde socken, Algustorp Pastorat, Vas
tergbtland, Sweden. With her parents,
Andreas and Lena Lundborg, and her
brothers Johannes, Andreas, Gustaf,
Lars and little Samuel, she came to this
country in 1861, where the family set
tled near West Lake, Kandiyohi county,
Minnesota.
In the Indian outbreak on the 20th of
August, 1862, her brothers Anders, Gus
taf and Lars were killed and Samuel
was wounded. The nearly heartbroken
parents then left, with their two re
maining children, for St Paul where
they resided about a year. In 1863, the
family came to Carver where they stay
ed until Johanna was confirmed In the
fall of 1865, the Lundborg family came
to Nest Lake and the following spring
settled again on their old homestead
near West Lake. Later Johanna went
to St. Cloud to attend school, making
her home with a family by the name cf
Bennett. Here she stayed until her
mother's illness necessitated her return
home.
In 1869 she was married to Erick
Paulson, who had served in the army
during the Civil War. The ceremony
was performed by Rev. Lundblad at the
old log church near New London. The
young couple bought the Lundborg farm
in Section 6, town of Arctander, settled
there and with hard work and skillful
management, made this farm one of the
finest in the county. Eight children were
born to Mr. and Mrs. Paulson of which
five are now living and all married, the
children are Samuel of Ortonville, Peter
of Willow City, N Lewis on the old
homestead, Emma, now Mrs. Martin
Quamme of Kerkhoven township and
Selma, now Mrs A G. Spiess of Garvin,
Minn. There are nine grandchildren
The eldest daughter, Lena, with whom
Mrs. Paulson lived for six years died
about a year ago. She was married to
Mr. Bernt Thompson and lived at Swift
Falls.
The funeral, which took place at the
Quamme home and West Norway Lake
church, Saturday, March 25, was, in
spite of the very bad roads, well at
tended. The floral contributions were
the most beautiful seen in the church.
Miss Cora Syse played some beautiful
selections at the piano, and Rev. Soten
dahl conducted the funeral sermon at
the church and the solemn rites at the
grave where the remains rest in the
West Norway Lake cemetery.
The pall bearers were Jacob Ram
stad, Andrew Johnson, John Eliason,
Thosten Quamme, P. A. Gandrud and
Ole Ellingboe.
All the children of the deceased were
present, her husband and her aged bro
ther, Samuel of Cologne, Minn. Mr.
Lundborg, who has all his life felt the
painful effect of the wound received
when a boy of nine, is now a lonely
man, his wife having died a few weeks
before his sister.
Mrs. Paulson was a kind warm heart
ed Christian woman, and she will be
missed not only by her near relatives
but also the many friends and neigh
bors in this community.
KAREN HJELLE.
The Angel of Death has again called
away one of our old residents, when
Miss Karen Hjelle was relieved from
her earthly pains on the evening of
March 18, 1916 after failing health aH
winter.
Miss Hjelle was born November 12,
1850, at Fodvang, an annex to Ringboe
parish, Gulbrandsdalen, Norway, where
she grew up and lived until in the
spring of 1875 when the family came
to this county and settled down in town
of Arctander. This has been her home
until her death. Since the death of her
parents, she has made her home with
her brother Ole, and family.
Karen was a good Christian and if
a quiet disposition. She leaves to mourn
her death, two sisters and one brother,
together with other relatives. The fu
neral was held on the tweny-second,
with services at the home and church
Rev. M. A. Sotendahl was the officiat
ing clergyman. Interment was made in

President Hodgman,
S Paul, Minn.
Dear Pres. Hodgman:
The Macalester Glee Club rendered a
splendid evening of song here last night.
They had a fine audience, and I believe
it will prove quite an ad for the college.
Every one speaks in the highest of
praise. I am,
Yours very truly,
L. W. GADE.
With every number encored at least
twice and some for triple offerings the
program rendered last evening by the
Macalester College Glee Club proved
most attractive. The Club is well bal
anced and the numbers selected were cf
sufficient variety to afford proper inter
est. The singing of Mr. Guthrie, the
director of the Club, and the piano solo
of Mr. Llndgren were especially deserv
ing of mention. The closing number in
which a number of songs were given by
the Club was effectively staged.—St.
