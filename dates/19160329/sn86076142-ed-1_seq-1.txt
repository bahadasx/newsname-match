Lecturer
Peter W. Collins, the distinguished
orator from Massachusetts, wan greet
ed last night at the Airdome by a mul
titude that wan only restricted by the
size of thn house. Over 800 people,
listened with close attention during
tlie course of a discourse and the en
suing catachiBm until evelen o'clock
without Knowing the least sign of tin
rest,
The audience was by far the must
representative that lias ever been ga
thered in Tonopah and at the conclu
sion the speaker expressed his thanks
for the general desire for enlighten
ment and information manifested
during the question and answer
period. Hon. Hugh H. Brown was
chairman of the meeting.
The lecture was not what Mr. Col
lins rails his anti-Socialist lecture, but
dealt mora directly with the unsettled
industrial conditions of the United
States. Socialism was merely an in
cldent to the general discussion. The
only rudeness displayed during the
evening was by some drunken man at
the door, who shouted a warning to
the speaker. Instantly Mr. Collins
stopped and quickly remarked that if
the Socialists wished to be judged
by that kind of interference he was
perfectly willing to let their case rest
I with the jury of the audience. "I have
j fought for free speech," explained the
lecturer," and I Insist in having the
j right to speak without further inter
j ruption. Such an unseemly attack

Worst Wreck in the History of

CLEVELAND, Mar. 29. At least
thirty people were killed and more
than forty were injured in a wreck of
three of the New York Central's crack
passenger trains near Amherst, thirty-
seven miles west of Cleveland. The
wreck was one of the worst on the
Central's system. Fog obscured a sig
nal set by the first section of the east
bound Pittsburg, Baltimore and Buffa
lo limited, resulting in another section
of that train crashing Into it. Before
the signal men could flag the twen-
tieth century limited westbound, it
crashed into the wreckage on the
wesl bound track just before dawn,
Farmers and villagers rushed to the
assistance of the stricken passengers,
but work was hampered by darkness
and fog. None of the passengers on
the twentieth century limited was in
jured. Most of those killed were for
eigners In the rear coaches of the flrst
section. The, dead include several
women. Many of those killed have
not been identifield.

ATHENS, Mar. 29. The bombard-j
ment ot Salonikl. involving the death j
of Creek soldiers and civilians, has j
aroused deep feeling. Bitter editorials
appear in the liberal press against the j
continued neutrality of Oreece. The!
question of declaration of matial law!
was raised in an excited session of the,
chamber of deputies. The government j
has discouraged hostile comment on
the actions of the Germans. Premier
Skouloudis refused to continue a de
hale involving foreign relations, "Be
cause our higher interests impose
silence." In the chamber the raid is
characterized as, "Simply assassina
tion" and designed to intimidate the
Creeks.

forty Peet of Ledge With Only
Twenty Per Cent Waste
in Crosscut
Apparently the wonders of the To-
nopah Extension mine will never cease
and its developments are only in their
beginnings. Such ft broad assertion
seems justified In the light of a re
cent occurrence In that property. At
a point 100 feet weBt of the Victor
crosscut the Murray vein has been
again crosscut and here it is forty
feet between walls. Of this vast body
of quartz eighty per cent has been
found to be of excellent commercial
grade.
The ledge at this point Is 1540 feet
below the collar ot the shaft. The
values are almost identical to those
on the level above and the ore body
g much wider, indicative of the truth
if the theory of the management that
in the 1260 and 1350 west drifts, only
he top of the ledge was penetrated
What the east and west drifts on the
1540 will determine is lift to the im
agination, but in the opinion of the
writer they will prove that the Exten
sion Is the biggest silver mine in the
world, an opinion that is beginning to
be voiced by others.
A very interesting development will
take place tomorrow or Thursday la
the property. It will be the hollug
through from the upraise from the
1540 into the winze from the 1350,
both of which workings are In contin
uous ore.
The company is employing all the,
carpenters it can secure in Tonopah
getting the enlarged reduction plant
in readiness. The additional stamps
were planned to begin dropping on
July 1, but the work is being hurried
so that it may be a few days before
that time. Within another week the
electric railroad from ttie Victor mine
to the Extension mill will probably
be In operation. It Is a third rail sys
tem, an extension of the one built
from the mill to the No. 2 shaft.
There are already 2,000 tons of ore
at the Victor awaiting transportation,
all of which was removed In develop
ment operations.
