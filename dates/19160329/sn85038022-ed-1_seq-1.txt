FLOODSTAGE
In I lie Ohio Mny lie Looked For At
This Polnt-Mslng At All
Points Abnic.
Tho Ohio rlvor nt this point was ris
ing Wednesday morning nbout ono nnd
a half Inches an hour, tho gaugo nt 8
o'clock standing nt 44 feet.
At Pittsburg nt midnight tho stngo
at tho point was 21.3 feet nnd tho river
wns rising nt tho rnto of .3 feet on
hour. The tracks of tho Pittsburg &
Western railroad nnd tho former Fed
eral League baseball park woro under
water nnd many cellars of residences
on tlio lower north sldo were flooded,
lltvcrmcn expected a stngo of 24 feet
to bo reached by C o'clock Wednesday
morning.
MAHIIIAdE MI'LNNi:.
Parkorsburg, W. Va. The Ohio
river will reach n Btngo of 40 feet, four
feot above tho danger lino at this point
by Thursday, according to n predic
tion made by tho local United States
Weather llureau. Tho stage was nt .12
feet nnd tho water wns rising nt tho
rate of .4 feet an hour. Tho rnln
which has been falling hero almost
continuously for thirty hours, stopped
lato yesterday.
Huntington, W. Vn. River rising 4
Inches per hour Wednesday morning.
Gnugc 3!).B feet. Kxpect 48 feet.
Reports Tuesday night showed that
the Kanawha nt 5 o'clock had passed
tho nineteen-foot stage nnd was ris
ing ten Inches nn hour. Flood Btngc
at Charleston Is thirty feet.
The Muskingum wns running out
fast at JCanesvlllo where tho wntcr

ing, 27 feet 4 Inches, rising four inches
an hour.
Tho Scioto river nt Portsmouth,
which drniuu centrnl Ohio, was re
ported fnlling Tuesday night, this be
ing n favorable Indication.
Just before tho big 1913 rise start
ed there wns fifteen feet less wntcr In
the river than at tho start of tho pres
ent rise. However, conditions in the
lower valley nro more favorable, there
being slightly less water at Cincin
nati and considerably less nt I-otils-vlllc,
thus permitting the flood to run
out. Whereas there was no snow In
the mountains nt the beginning of tho
1913 rise, the federal reports showed
thirteen Inches In the mountains nt the
Bt(rt of the present rains.
The gaugo nt this point In 1907
showed C9.2 nnd in 1913 It was CC.4.

BISHOP MJERSON
Addresses Large Audience At Third
Street M. I!. Church, (ihliig As
Ills Subject, "America's
Primary In tho Sister
lined of 'nlIoni."
It war. under great difficulties that
Illshop William F. Anderson managed
to get to Maysvlllo In order to nd
d't'SH n Maysvlllo nudlenco on Tuesday
right. Tho bishop should havo ar
rived In Mnysvllle on C. & O. trnln
No. 2, duo hero nt 1:40 p. in., but owing
to tho wreck at Stony Point, ho got
only ns far ns Augusta by rail. From
there, after several moro delays, ho
had to come to Maysvlllo by automo
bile, arriving In this city at 7:45 p. m.
Arriving nt tho church ho found a
largo nudlenco nwnltlng him, nnd aft
er n short song service he was Intro
duced and for tho next hour and n
half ho held the closest attention of
his. audience, giving ns his address,
"America's Primacy In tho Sisterhood
of Nations." Bishop Anderson has only
recently returned from a tour of Eu
rope and Africa and Is therefore thor
oughly acquainted with conditions In
the war stricken countries of tho Old
World.' Ho spoke plainly yet graphic
ally of tho things ho had seen, speak
ing of them as only ono can after hav
ing seen for himself. He compared tho
unenlightened Africa with the "en
lightened" Kurope and showed clearly
that the lack of Christianity wns the
cause of tho great world Btrugglo. He
bitterly denounced those who were re
sponsible for the war nnd said that
after visiting In Kurope he could
truthfulb say that ho was certainly
proml to live In America, a Christian
nation. In closing he mailo a pica for
universal peace by enthroning the
Lord Jesus Christ ns the Savior of tho
world. He ndvocated preparedness
through this means.
His theme was largo but ho handled
it In a masterly way and thoso who
heard the lecture pronounced it ns ono
of tho best ever heurd In Maysville.
After the lecture all adjourned to
the Sunday school room where the Kp
worth class had refreshments pre
pared and every ono wns given a
chance to become acquainted with the
bishop and enjoy n social half hour.
The people of Maysvlllo are hoping
that they will again have the chance of
hearing Bishop Anderson again some
tlmo In the near future.
SOME BUSINESS
Tim ('. & O. In Handling tlio Lnrgcst
Tonnage Through This City That
Kicr Went Oicr That Line.
Tho movement of freight over the
C &. O. rnllroad Is certainly tnxlng tho
cnpnclty of tho forces that aro en
trusted with that branch of this great
system.
For several weeks past people havo
been noticing tho numerous heavy
trains passing both cast nnd west
through this city, but of course, hnd no
Idea of tho real number of trains that
woro put through hero, ns they uro go
ing botli day nnd night.
During the flrst twenty-two days of
March thcro passed through Mnysvllle
over the C. & O., 917 trains of nt least
sixty cars to tho train, making an nv
crago of ono train every thlrty-flvo
minutes, and over 55,000 enrs loaded
with coal and mcrchndlsc.
Tills shows whnt nn up-to-tho-niluuto
force of men nnd equipment
can accomplish when systematically
worked together.
Another busy place along tho line
of the C. & O. is tho "hump" at Rus
sell. At this "hump" where cars arc
automatically weighed and consigned
to different tracks, Friday night was n
record breaker for tho night shift.
Tho day shift has more men at work
than tho night shift, consequently they
handle moro enrs, but that night some
enrs woro surely handled. About 600
Is tho average but that night 743 cars
were put over tho "hump."
