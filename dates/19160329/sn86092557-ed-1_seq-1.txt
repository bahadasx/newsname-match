Warren Walte., shortly after, legal

the psychological phases of tho ac
cused dontist's case, confessed that an
abnormal monster within, himself
whom the dentist for years has known

man .from Egypt,' put a "mixture ot
various deadly disease germs into food

Waite's being when Mrs. Waite's
father, JohnE. Peck, came .to visit
