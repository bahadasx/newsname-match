Entire Submarine Situation Is
Viewed Here With Gravest
Alarm.
NEW EVIDENCE IS STARTLING
Officials Convinced Kaiser Has
Entered on Course More
Terrible Than Heretofore.
Only by a complete abandon
ment of her new submarine cam
paign against enemy merchant
men can Germany avoid a diplo
matic break with the United
States.
This view was expressed today
in official quarters following the
receipt at the State Department
of the most startling evidence tha:
has come here concerning the
most recent attacks on ships car
rying Americans.
The evidence included affidavits
from three of the American sur
vivors of the torpedoed British
horseship, Englishman.
Peter McDonald, M. A. Burke
and George MacDonald have
taken oath before the American
consul at Liverpool that the Eng
lishman was not only torpedoed
by a German submarine, but was
first shelled.
FOURTH AMERICAN KILLED.

ber of tho Englishman's crcsv, was
The' affidavits shov that the attack
on the Kngllshman was utmost an ex
act counUrpurt of the attack last De
cember ty on Austrian submarine1 on
tho Italian liner Ancoun, on which a
score of Americans lost their live.
While It Is Indicated that the litis
llshman wah piobably trying to escape
when sho was shelled, It is positively
asserted that at tho time that tho tor
pedo was tired tho Englishman's en
gines had stotped and she was In the
attitude of tutuiilsslon.
In addition to the affidavits from the
three Americans rescued from tho Eng
lishman, tho State Department received
from tho American einrussy at London
statements, to be backed liter by af
fidavits, from Joshua Armltage, and
Wilder PtntUld uiid George Crocker,
two American mmlvuri from tho cnr.n
nel steam Sussex, which statemonth, of
ficials of the Stato Depaitment declared,

Gravest Alarm Felt.
Tho cntlro situation Is viewed hiro
with gravest alarm. Tho rapid succes
sion In which tho attacks havo oc
curred indicates plainly to American
otricials that Germany has launcneil
upon a submarine campaign more ter
rible. In Its purposes than any hereto
fore employed.
Armed or unarmed, enemy or neutral,
alt merchant ships plying In North
tiea waters and about tho Urltlsh Isles
ale apparently tho targets aimed at.
For the United States, somo officials
observe to scttlo up each case on the
b&slc of "expressions of regret, "dls
avoways," and promises to punish com
manders, would bo to udopt a ridicu
lous method of barter.
In the opinion oi most officials some
thing bigger must como from Germany,
and tho least that most officials would
demand would bo ft completo abandon
ment of tha submarlno campaign a
campaign whoso only purposo has been
a cutting off of commerco between
Great Britain and the rest of tho world,
and whoso chief result has been a stag
gering toll of Innocent men, womon, and
bodies who havo been slain.
House in Conference.
Col. B. M. House, tho President's con
fidential agent, who has recently re
turned from the belligerent capitals of
Europe, and who conferred with tho
war lords in Berlin, has been In almost
constant conference since yesterday
with tho President and officials ot tho
State Department.
Today he conferred for more than an
hour with Counselor Polk ond Secretary
of State Lansing.
Ambassador Gerard, at Berlin, has
been Instructed to obtain whatever facts
the German government has seen able
to set on tho new outrages.
But he has been cautioned not to placo
himself In the position of discussing the
affairs with tho German government.
The United States Government Is In
bo mood to debate the situation with
Germany.
BANDONIK
Congress Holds Back
On U-Boat Debate
With the submarine situation as
between this country and Ger
many at a most acute stage
and the danger of a break of
relations grave in the extreme,
Congress is restraining its de
sire to break out into discus
sion of international problems.
It is, exercising this restraint
with difficulty. In the cloak
rootois and corridors today
there was no end of talk and
gossip about conditions.
Uncertainty and apprehension
over the jeopardizing pf Amer
ican lives arc deepened. While
the President has told leaders
he will lay the matter before
Congress before there is a
break it is not certain jyst how
he will do so.
It is assumed at the Capitol he
will not ask the advice of Con
gress, but will simply state the
facts and tell it what he pur
poses to do.
RUSSIANS ATTACK

Berlin Reports Czar's Losses at
80,000 Men French. Beat
Back Assault.
LONDON, March 39. In a now drive
on the eastern front the Russians
have attacked tho Germans on n line
more than seventy-live miles long,
and are pushing their offensive with
great determination.
Berlin reports that tho Czar's losses
have been not less than SO.OOO men, and
that the German positions have been
held at all points. Petrograd dis
patches, on the other hand, say the
Russians aro making steady progrevd.
The Germans yesterday on the
Western front made another desper
ate attempt to break through tho
French lines northwest of Verdun, and
wero beaten back with heavy losses.
A bombardment of great violence
against the French positions, from
Avocourt to Bcthlncourt, west of the
Moure, was followed by an Infantry
onslaught. In which great bodies of
troops were hurled forward in suc
cessive waves only to be forced to
retreat by bayonet charges, supported
by a great curtain of machine gun
and shell fire.
Several days of Intense artillery
preparation preceded tho renewed ef
fort of the Germans to lessen the
six miles intervening between them
and the Parlr.-Verdun railway, and

RISE IN GASOLENE
NATIONAL SCANDAL,
CONGRESSMANSAYS
4
Two Bills Introduced in House
to Check Upwpjd Trend of
Price in Country.
OIL MAGNATES DENOUNCED
One Measure Puts Control of
Business in Hands of Fed
eral Trade Board.
Oil magnates and refiners of gasolene
were denounced today by members of
Congress, one of whom decfared the
sensational rise In the price of gasolene
has become a national scandal.
Two bills designed to check tha up
ward trend of tho price of automobile
fuel were Introduced In the House. One
was proposed by Congressman Halvor
Stcenerson, a Mlnnetota Republican,
who would have the Federal Trade
Commission authorized to regulato the
prlco of petroleum products.
The other measuro was Introduced by
Congressman William Schley Howard
Georgia Democrat, who proposed the
placing of an embargo on the shipment
of all petroleum products from this
country.
Another Big RUo Due.
in conrcUon with the Howard hill It
became known that the United States
Government, as well as the private
consumer, faces tho prospect of another
big rUo In price of gasolene. Govern
ment contracts with the refineries are
about to expire, and It Is understood the
refineries have declined to renew these
contracts at lesa than 40 cent for gaso
lene purchased after .Tune 1.
The Steenerson bill proposes an
amendment t the trade commission act
that would give the commission plenary
power to step In and check the ex
orbitant price now being asked for
gasolene.
Both hilly are drawn under the Inter
state commerce clause, and their au
thors say there Is no doubt of the Juris
diction of Congress.
"The continual rise In the price of
gasolene," ald Congressman Howard,
"which Is arbitrarily fixed by the re
fineries, has pot only reached the limit
of Its use, but Is becoming a national
scandal."
Congressman Steenerson says that
"covcrnrucnt Investigators report the
lilch prlco or gasolene is aue to aru
ttVtrrT'Talhcr than economic causes and
yet the Department or justice says u
cannot find sufficient evidence to war
rant prosecution under the anti-trust
law."
SayB System Has Failed.
"This therefore, contllnued Mr. Hteen-
erson," I an instance where the com
petitive system has tailed to secure to
the people reasonable (prices of one
of the prime necessities of life, and we
must cither sunmit to exploitation ay
monoDolv r.rlces. or have prices fixed
by authority of Congress, That Con
gress ha the power cannot be ques
tioned.
Comrressman Howard showed that
whllo the refineries claim the demand
for gasolene abroad has boosted tne
rrlce. the exnortatlons In reality are
failing off. He Intimates broadly that

'UTILE BAD MAN' IN
District Attorney Believes
Walte's "Spirit" Aide Will Be
Found If He Exists.
PROSECUTOR NOT CONVINCED
Mrs. Horton, Accused Man's
Friend, Declares She Never
Heard of Such Person.
NEW YORK, March 2 A hunt for tha
mysterious and sinister figure from
Shadowland, described by Dr. Arthur
Warren Walte as "the little bad man
from Egypt" and also as the "real"
murderer of Mr. and Mrs. John E. Peck,
of Grand Rapids, through tho agency
of Walte, Is on today.
Mrs. Margaret Horton. Walte's
"ftudlo" componlon at the Plaza, wm
not acquainted with tho "man from
llgypt." she said today. The petite
woman of mystery In the case waited
nearly nil morning' at tho office of
her attorney, presumably for permis
sion to see Walte at the hospital.
"I had to laugh when I read the
paiers about this 'man from
Kcypt.' " lhe said.
"Dr. Walte never mentioned such a
ticrson or such a thine during our
acquaintance. He was a irnod. sensi
ble boy and talked rationally al
ways I'm very anxloi's to see him."
Prompted by "Spirit."
In his confession Dr. Walte said all
of the evil things he did were prompted
by the spirit element In his life, and
that the dominating spirit was an In
fluence with distinct personality who
could best be described to those who
did not know his terrific power for evil
as the "man from Egypt."
"This creature came Into my life and
made really two men of me," said Walte
to Detective Schlndler.
If Dr. Walto 1 sincere In his belief In
tho "man from Egypt," the district at
torney believes that traces of the shade
will be found in Dr. Walte's life prior
to yesterday. Ho thinks Dr. Walte

Nesbit Says Washington Leads
All States in Per Capita
Amounts.
That the District of Columbia will
continue to lead In 1916 every Stnto
and Territory In tho amount of life
Insurance cnrrled per capita Is the
opinion of Charles P. Nesbit, super
intendent of Insurance, based upon
nn abstract nf tho returns of the life
Insurance companies prepared In ad
vance of his annual report.
"The total premiums paid for life
Insurance, ordinary and Industrial,
exclusive of fraternal and weekly
death benefit premiums. Is $4,726,
247.46," says Mr. Nestyt In a state
ment Issued today.
"Tho total number of policies, or
dinary and Industrial, carried by Dis
trict of Columbia residents was
361, 525, nlmost equal to the number
of residents. Tho total amount for
which District residents are InsuredN
IS Ma,4J,9Z5.3Z.
"This undoubtedly means that the
District will still lead every Stato
and Territory in the Union in the
amount of llfo Insurnnce cnrrled per

"The per capita Insurance carried
here exceeds $380. Home States are
as low as $50 per capita,
"There arc forty-one life companies

USE OF ilLROAD
His Official Report Comes to
War Department Trooper
Killed by Train.
First official confirmation of the re
ports that General I'ershlng has been
using the Mexican Northwestern rail
road south of Casaa Qrandcs came to
the War Department today.
The dispatch, brief and giving no de
tails, told of the death on March 24', of
George A. Hudnelt. a saddler of Troop
JJ, Tenth Cavalry, who was Injured In
a railroad wreck1 south ot Casas
Qrandcs.
Incidentally, the death of Hudnelt Is
the first casualty reported by Pershing
since his expedition crossed the Mexi
can border in pursuit of Villa.
J General Funston, speaking for General
I'ershlng. asked that the news of the
death be communicated to Hudnelt's
widow, who lives at Fort Huachuca,
Arir.
Reports From Consuls.
Whether Pershing seized the rail
road line or insisted upon using It
regardless of Carrnnza's refusal to
permit such usc or whether ho had
obtained permission from the local
Carranza commander Is not known.
It Is suggested as possible that
Hudnelt and a few other American
stragglers may have simply been
riding on the wrecked train In an
effort to catch up with tho main ex
pedition. An extension of one month has been
granted by the Carranza government
to the period within which mine
owners In Mexico must pay taxes
amounting to between $1,000,000 and
$2,000,000. Most of the mine owners
are Americans.
The Stato Department gave out the
following summary of reports re
ceived from consuls In Mexico:
"The department is In receipt of ad
vices from Nogales stating: that the
Nogales district continues quiet.
"A similar roport has also been re
ceived from Matamoros,
