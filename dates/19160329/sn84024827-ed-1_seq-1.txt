Conference of Entente Allies

COUNTRIES UNITED IN
ENDS TO BE SOUGHT
Submarine Warfare is Still

plomacy Between Washing

'By Review Leased Wire)
PARIS. March 28. The conference
today, adopted the following resolu
tions juit prior to adjournment:
"The representatives of the allied
governments in conference at Taris,
March 28. 1916. affirm the complete
community- of views and solidity of
the allies. They confirm all the mia
sures taken to realize this end.
"The allied governments decided to
put into practice in the economic
domain their solidaty of iews and in
terests. They charge the economic
conference, which is to be held short
ly at Paris, to propose for them ap
propriate measures for the realization
of the solidarity.
'With a vie v.to strengthen, co
ordinate, and unify tha diplomatic ac
tion of the exercised to prevent the
dancer from the commercial activities
of the enemy the conference has de
cided to establish at Paris a perman
ent committee, in which all the allies
will be represented.
"The conference has decided: First
to continue the organization, already
made, at London, of anything interna
tional centra! bureau of freights, sec
ond, to proceed in common, and with
the shortest delay to seek practical
needs to a portion euuatably between
the allied nations freight rates."
WA5HINGTON, March 28 Secret
ary Lansing, vith the approval of
President Wilson, has instructed Am
bassador Gerard to inquire of Ger
many whether' any of its sulamrines
torpedoed the British channel steam
ship Sussex, upon which 25 American
citizens were traveling, or the British
horse ship Englishman, which went
down with a loss of one American
life.
As the situation stands nincouclu
sive proof that submarines sunk either
ship, all evidence at hand indicates
that both were torpedoed without
warning. Vpon the response from
P.crlin to Mr. Gerard's injury may de
pend the next step of the American
government.
At this time it is made clear that
no action has been taken which in
any sense may be construed to mean
a protest. President Wilson laid all
the State Department's reports on the
subject before the cabinet today.
It wan after the meeting that Sec
retary Lansing allowed it to become
known that it had been determined to
make inquiries of Germany.
They probably were in Gerard's
hands tonight.
The general situation is still fraught
with tension. Two negro American
citizens who weie aboard the Man
chester Engineer, escaped. If a Ger
man submarine attacked either the
Sussex of the Englishman il is admit
ted that the resultant situation will
be most serious. An unofficial state
ment has been made that a German
submarine sunk the Englishman.
While otr.cials' expression ol opinion
was withheld it was intimated thai
should sucli a development occur the
position of the Cn.ted States would
be denned until it was known that
tiie men responsible for violating the
rights of humanity, the principles of
international law, the solemn assur
ances given by the German j-nvi rn
ment, actually had been puuisiitd.
I'ntil now the administration lias
not decided just what action will be
taken if Germany flatly denies that
any of its submarines was concerned
in either case, e.en though the cir
cumstantial evidence received indi
cates the contrary.
Such a state of affairs, officials say.
will be met when it arises. If further
developments fhould cause the Presi
dent to determine that the breaking
off of diplomatic relations with Gtr
many would be necessary he would
go before t'oitgrcs, announce his de
cision and explain the acts leading up
to it.
While the Piet.idcnt has full author
ity to break off relations, he realizes
that such an act almost inevitably
would lead to war. and would feel
himself obligated fully lo inform Con
gress before taking such a step.
Among high officials of the admin
istration there appears to be a differ
ence of opinion regarding the course
il should pursue, should Germany de
ny responsibility for the attacks and
the American government find con
vincing evidence that they were the
work of German submarines. Some
officials believe that in cureumtaPees
the accumulation of offense against
the I'nited State would justify the
severence of diplomatic relations.
Other3 do cot feel that such action
would be justified.

Pershing also remained unreported. 'on Piactirally impossible, accord-
but this lack of information created
no uneasiness, for General Pershing
still has orders to work out his own
problem.
Full realization of the dangers nio
which some of the detachments must
be moving was acknowledged. Villa's
known ability as a director of am
buscades has aroused frank expres
sions of fear among army officials
that he may catch some of the Ameri
can troops in a mountain trap. '
Openly expressed pessimism as to
an early capture of Villa now is fre
quently heard. I'nless checked by lhe
forces of the de facto government, or
unless he himself decides to turn and
fight, there appears no reason Unlay
why the chase should cease until
Villa has led the Americans through
twisting mountain trails and over
waterless wastes for another "P0 miles
and more.
More auto trucks hav been asked
for by General Funston and when they
are In service, there will be a few
more than "00 along the different
lines of communication.
This increased number of ' auto
trucks, will not sohe the problem of
distributing supplies to the advanced
troops, however, since a large part of
the troops ore operating for away
from trails over which the cars can
be run.
The shifting lines of the chase
Villa is leading the Americans, has
made more apparent the desirability
of getting permission to use the Juarez-Chihuahua
line of the National
Railway as well as the Northwestern
Railroad but General Funston has re
frained from making any representa
tions on the subject preferring not to
project a possible embarrassing fea
ture in negotiations for the- lines.
It was pointed out that supplies
routed through Chihuahua
dellvered to the advanced troops nn
with less loss of time and that a line
of communication along that route
could he guarded with fewer troops
than one along the more circuitions
mountainous route of the Northwest
ern. If either railroad is used it Is prob
able that the troop now extending
from Columbus through Casas Grand
es to the positions of the advanced
cavalry would be moved a'on

KL PASO. March 2S. Disuatches

(cans from different points in Chihua
liua caused a belief here tonight that
Pancho Villa was beaded for San An-
ures. annut twtjniy-live miles south
west of Chihuahua City, headquarters
of the bandits. He is thought already
not less than fifty miles ahead of his
pursuers and possibly leading a chase
at a much grepter distance. There
are several Americans in Kl Paso who
are not only thoroughly familiar with
the country through which Villa in
fleeing bill who were also well ac
ouainted w ith the b?ndit chief in for
mer davs. They are agree.! that Vil
li's objective it the district around
Parral and south from there to Torre
on in which the numerous Villista
bands, under the leadership of Canuto
Reyes, are operating with considera
ble success.
If Villa is able to effect a junction
with Reyes the problem of his exter
mination will have become a very se
rious one as he will then be able to
control several thousands of soldiers,
who. split into guerilla bands, might'
le able to keep up a desultory moun
tain warfare for an unlimited period.
The one hope at present is ihat the
American cavalrymen may be able to
catch up with Villa before Be gen

Nothing but pack mules and horses
an be used and even these must be
loaded litlitly. The establishment of
a great base of supplies and muni
tions to the nearest ioini to these
tortuous mountains is understood to
be Pershing's plan but the niain:en
alice of this base is considered an im
possibility without railroad facilities
on the backward trail to the I'nited
States border.
As far as the border is concerned
conditions seem to have settled down
to a condition of absolute stagnation.
Considerable excitement was caused
early today bv a report that Mexican
had crossed the Rio Grande at a point
thiny-!wo mi!es east of here and at
tempted a raid on the ranch of C. K.
Keltey. former mayor of El rs.
Troops were rushed to the seen of
the supposed raid but after some
hours of fruitless search they return
ed w ith the report thai no trace of any
raiders had been found and thai they
believed the whole story was due to
the overwrought nerves of a woman.
The excitement of lhe incident
quickly died down and the day passed
with a eivnplete absence of wild rum
