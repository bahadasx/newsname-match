For Treasurer
Election day was quiet in Denison
and very little work was done by eith
er ticket. Some of the candidates
were out getting the voters to tiie polls
but no effort wa*i made to bring out
the full vote. The result of the elec
tion was much the same as the citi
zens caucus held a few weeks ago, both
tickets polling about the same vote
as they received at the caucus.

The return of the present adminis
tration goes to show that the voters of
Denison. are well satisfied with the
present incumbents and endorse their
administration.
The Result in Dow City.
The city election passed off peace
fully Monday. Although the caucuses
were called too late for the candidates'
names to be printed on the ballots, the
voters were given a cue as to whose
names to fill in. Some little skirmish
ing was done by various candidates,
although others hardly made an effort
to capture the office. When the votes
were counted the following returns
were given out:

The city election held Monday re
sulted in the present officers being re
elected with the exception of Dr. Hal
C. Simpson, who withdrew from the
citizens caucus and whose place will
be taken on the council by Mr. Ben
Pautsch. It had beer supposed that
the supporters of the candidates whose
names were placed on the ballot by
petition would make a great showing
at the election, but it is evident that,
the voters did not favor putting new
men into the city offices when they
had so much important work to carry
out.
The program submitted hids fair to
be the strongest ever given by the
Redpath-Vawter people. They are
especially anxious that it should be
their best as it is their tenth anniver
sary program.
The seven musical'offerings will be:
Bohumir Kryl and his band larger
than the one he had last summer.

THE BOYS' SP8ING OPENING.
One of the Most Pleasino Affairs of
Its Kind Held Last Saturday
Store Most Attractive.
The spring opening held by the Boys
Department Store Saturday was one
of the most pleasing affairs of its kind
ever held in the Jbity. The propriet
ors, together with the heads of the
different departments spent consider
able time making preparations for the
event and their efforts were appreciat
ed' by a record freaking attendance
tiie store being packed all day. not
withstanding the ?old, rainy weather.
The store was most attractively de
coratc'|d for the occasion, potted flow
ers together with- vases of beautiful
cut flowers being used profusely. The
spring goods were displayed in the sev
eral departments and the clerks were
kept busy showing visitors the very
latest in spring apparel.
A feature of the opening was the
music furnished'* by the Denison or
chestra which played during both the
afternoon and evening. Each lady at
tending the opening was presented
with a carnation.
Spring opening at the Boys' stoer
is an event always looked forward to
by the women, not ftftly of Denison,
but of the surrounding territory and
the event this year surpassed any
thing previously held by this popu
lar store.

STYLE REVIEW
MOST PLEASING
Geo. Menagh & Co. Gain New Laurels
in Holding Style Review Mon
day and Tuesday Evenings
PLEASING PROGRAM RENDERED
David Menagh, Who His Charge
the "House of Menagh" at Oma
Jia, Makos Introductory.
Sincere and enthusiastic are tiie ex
clamation on every hand when men
tion is made of the style review staged
by the George Menagh company de
partment store of Denison on Monday
and Tuesday evenings of this week at
the Germania opera house. Never be
fore in this city has such a beautiful
display of charming suits, practical
gowns and dainty frocks been viewed
in so delightful a manner. A fashion
review is a new method of presenting
tiie latest in women's wearing apparel
and is used by the large department
stores and exclusive shops in the big
ger cities to present to the buying
public the season's fashions. Only a
few weeks ago tiie Menaghs presented
a fashion shew at the Brandeis theater
in Omaha and this was attended by
over three thousand women during the
two afternoons it was put on. It was
such a great success and created such
favorable comment that the Menaghs
said what was good Enough for Omaha
was none too good for Denison and so
the show was put on here.
The fashion review was an enter
tairtment in itself, the program con
sisting of selections by the J. V. Bar
borka orchestra and several beautiful
solos by Lena Ellsworth Dale, of Oma
ha, accompanied by Mrs. Mae Lovely
Goss, of this city. The selections ren
dered by the solist were in. keeping
with the occasion, conveying to the
audience in a charming manner the
pwcct. delights of the spring time and
furnishing a pleasing prelude to the
entrance of the girlish models' who dis
played the gowns. .Mr. David Menagh,
who is in charge of the House of
Menagh in Omaha, in presenting the
seven models, briefly told the purpose
nf the fashion review. He stated that
the gowns, suits and frocks are first
designed by French artists, and dress
makers make them up in a number of
different styles. but that they do not
hdfforne the fashion until worn by the
ladies in the communities in which
they are sold. He impressed upon the
minds of those present that it is the
ladies of Denison who make the fash
ions in Denison, and who govern the
styles carried-in stock by the several
stores who handle ready to wear gar
ments. He thanked the people of Den­
$9.85
m&Mi awfrirttliirrtaa
ison lor having made it possible for
the George Menagh company to put on
a fashion review, stating that the
ladies of Denison and surrounding ter
ritory had purchased a class of gar
ments which were so fashionable that
when the store was opened in Omaha
the same lines were handled and they
proved popular in that city.
Seven young ladies of Omaha, who
have had experience in the correct and
pleasing manner of wearing and pre
senting the styles, were employed
George Menagh and company to come
to Denison in order that the display
migh be most effective. Each model
tripped onto the sfage to tiie soft
strains of tiie orchestra and as the
many exquisite details of the garments
were suggested by Mr. David Menagh,
the garments were displayed to the
best possible advantage. The garments
exhibited the utmost taste in their se
lection, combining style without ex
travagance, and were good looking
without being extreme. All of the
garments were taken from the ready
to-wear department of their store.
Tiie shoes were matched from the shoe
department and the hats worn were se
lected from their choiie millinery de
partment. From time to time the mod1
els passed through the audience to per
mit the closer inspection of the mate
rials and trimmings and deep interest
and enthusiasm was found on every
hand in the viewing of the styles. The
prices of tiie garments shown were not
exorbitant and in nearly every in
stance were within the reach of all.
Some of the higher priced garments
selling as high as seventy-five dollars
were exact reproductions from famous
designers such as Worth, Armand,
Jenny, Brandt, Caillot, Lambin, etc.
The originals from which these repro
ductions were made sell for as high as
five hundred dollars a garment, while
they are reproduced in this country,
using the same materials and measure
ments in carrying out every detail for
a much less amount. Several Wooltex
styles were shown and these caused
much favorable comment. The sport
ing outfits were particularly attract
ive and the exclamation of the speak
er, "Isn't it exquisite?" but voiced the
question in the minds of the audience
when the party gowns and afternoon
frocks were presented.
of
The stage setting was most attract
ive and carried out the suggestion of
spring. A Buick roadster and a seven
passenger touring car, loaned by the
J. B. Romans Company, the local deal
ers. were used on the stage, the first
•time that automobiles have appeared
in the opera house in Denison. The
evening program ended when the pret
ty models drove onto the stage in the
touring- car. laden with huge bouquets
of pink and white carnations and.
passing down through the aisles, they
distributed them among the ladies
present.

BASE -BALL FANS
HOLD MEETING
Meeting of Baseball Enthusiasts Last
VVeek Well Attended and An
Organization Effected
LEON POWERS IS PRESIDENT
Matter of Sunday Games Discussed,
but Nothing Definite Arranged
Along This Liita, However
A number of base ball enthusiast**
held a meeting at the court house one
evening last week for the purpose of
discussing the feasibility of organizing
a base ball team this year. The meet
ing was well attended and an organi
zation perfected.
There is considerable material avail
able this year for a winning ball team,
but the players are not anxious to
play .games unless they are support
ed by the people- of Denison. Last
year Denison had no ball teaqi as the
team the year previous had to be dis
banded on account of the poor atten
dance at the games, there not being
enough paid admissions to meet the
expenses. The boys expressed them
selves willing to go ahead and organ
ize a team if they were assured the
support of the people of the commun
ity.
The following were elected officers
of the association:
Leon Powers, liresid&nt,
Spencer Heiden, secretary,'
W. A. Cramer, treasurer,
James Mill, manager,
James Mill, A. E. Lyman, Otto Voa
gerau and P. J. Eggers. directors.
Some of those present brought up
the matter of playing ball on Sunday:
but as yet the organization has not de
cided whether or not to venture this.
There is strong opposition to Sunday
ball in Denison and matfy believe that
if tiie club undertakes to play ball
on that day, they will not receive the
support for their week day games*.
In order to insure good attendance at
the week day games, some business
men have suggested that the stores
and places of business close in the
afternoon once a week to permit ev
eryone to attend the games. We be
lieve that if this plan can be worked
out there will be no question but what
the team would not only pay expenses,
but make money besides.
Mrs. Adolph Eckert underwent' a"
serious operation at the Denison hos
pital last week. Her case was so seri
ous that she was on the operating
table for two hours before the sur
geons completed the work. We are
glad to report that she is doing nicely
and everything points to a speedy re
covery.
