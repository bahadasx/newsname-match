west of here, just before daybreak. So
badly mangled were some of the dead
that fragments were gathered up in a
basket and taken to the improvised
morgue at Amherst. All tbe dead
were passengers on the flyer.
Thu first section of the flyer had
stopped at a watering tank and a flagman
was sent back to warn the second
. section following a short distance behind.
The engineer, became of a
heavy fog, did not see the signal and
continued on-his way until his engine
crashed into the rear of the first section.
Several coaches were buckled
across tbe westbound track, on which
the Twentieth Century, on its way
from Cleveland to Chicago, was speed^
Ing through the mist and before it
B couia be. stopped it had plougbed-irito
^ the wreck, reducing the care to
kindling wood.
The rear coaches of the flyer's second
section were filled with foreigner?

They were ground under the wheelB
of the heavy engines drawing fbe
flyer, or crushed beneath the, steel
coaches as they toppled over. Before
the first crash they had been asleep,
numbers of them having removed their
coats containing such identification
papers as they happened to have. As
mese were uttered 07 tne wreck all
hope of Identification in many instances
was -lost
Crews of the train quickly sum.
moned help-and physicians hurried
from adjoining towns while Elyrfa
sent such supplies as could be hastily
gathered together. Belief trains were
ordered from Cleveland and other
places. The bodies of the dead were
taken to Amherst and the Injured to
Elyrla, where they were given medical
attention in the hospital. Such
of the passengers as escaped unhurt
were brought to Cleveland.
No one was killed on the Twentieth
Century, although a number in the
forward coaches were hurt.
Alfred Frltzelle, Cleveland salesman
for a flre extinguisher company,
was in the Toledo sleeper of the flrst
section and escaped injury, lie helped
in the rescue and then came on
to Cleveland.
,Aaron DeRay, of Pittsburg, who
' came through with Fritzelle, said he
was catapulted from his, berth Into
one occupied by a woman acrods the
aisle .when the crash came. DeRay
was uninjured.
A. Comcnsky. Pittsburg, coming
from Chicago, said he saw a woman
die in the wreck before he cotild extricate
her. Another woman he saw
was badly Injured and a man had his
arms torn from their sockets.
When the last named three left only
thirteen of the forty occupants of
the 'day coach were accounted for.
. They placed the number of dead at betnrAAn
as ftnri 30.
According to Fritzelle and DeRay,
the first section stopped fire minutes
after It left Amherst and was just
picking up speed again when the first
crash came. Two minutes later, they
said, the second occurred.

Season io-Bkdom.

and dancing in elaborate costumes fc

which brought down the house, while J*
Miss Nina Davis in a singing and h<
talking act brought forth encore after
encore, and the Stlllings in their M
banjo act were applauded time and Y
again. re
The exalted ruler, Wilbur C. Mor- w
rlson, acted as toastmaster and Tatrick
H.-Shields delivered afn eloquent jh
and touching eleven o'clock toast. *?
The brilliant success of the occa- cc
slon was largely due to Clifford It.
Hill, chairman of the social session fc
committee, and his assistants. The h<
feast wis fit for epecurians and the fa
service was ideal. ; h<
The Cadenza orchestra of several to
pieces furnished its.usual high class 8C
program of music.
