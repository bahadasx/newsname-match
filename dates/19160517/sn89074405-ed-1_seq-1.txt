BERLIN EMBASSY
OFFICER RETURNING
Suggested that American
Secretary Majr Have Mes
sage from Kaiser.
Washington, May 17.—President
Wilson has replied to the message
sent him recently by Pope Benedict,
in which the pope expressed the ear
nest hope that war between the Unit
ed States and Germany would not be
precipitated by the submarine issue
and conveyed the Impression that he
hoped the United States might be of
assistance ultimately in restoring
peace to Europe.
The reply of the president was con
veyed through Monslgnor Bonzano,
apostolic delegate here, who delivered
the pope's message to the white
house.
White house officials refused to dls
etjjsH the pope's message or the reply
of the, president, but in other quar
ters it-was indicated indefinitely that
t.he exchange of messages, had only
remotely to do with the question of
peace in Burope..
The president is understood to have
Informed the pope that he Is very
eager to keep the United States out
of the war, and would do everything
consistent with maintaining the honor
and rights of the United States.
Neither message will be made public.
At the white house It was said that
nothing is known of the mission to
this country of Secretary Grew, of
the American embassy in Berlin, who
now is on his way to the United
States. It has been suggested that
possibly he might be bringing a mes
sage from Emperor William to Presi
dent Wilson.

Washington, May 17.—For the sec
ond time since becoming president,
Woodrow Wilson last night made a
public and frank "confession" to the
members of the National Press club.
Speaking confidentially to the Wash
ington correspondents, he gave an
intimate review of his three years'
presidency and of-his impressions of
the domestic and foreign .problems.
Following Is the text of the presi
dent's speech:
"I am both glad and sorry, to be
here glad because I am always happy
to meet you, and know and like many
of you, and sorry because I have to
make a speech. One of the leading
faults of you gentlemen of the press
is your inordinate desire,to hear other
men talk, to draw them out upon all
occasions, whether they wish to be
drawn out or not. I remember being
In this press club once before, making
many unpremeditated disclosures of
myself, and then having you with
your singular instinct for publicity in
sist that I should give it way to ev
erybody else.
"I was thinking as I was looking
forward to coming here this evening
of that other occasion when -1 stood
very nearly at the threshold of the
duties that I have since been called1
upon to perform and I was going over
in the mind the impressions that I
then had by way of forecast of the
duties of president and comparing
them with the experiences that have
followed. I must say that the forecast
has been very largely verified, and
that the impressions I had then have
been deepened rather than weakened.
"You may recall that I said' then
that I felt constantly a personal de
tachment from the presidency that
one thing that I resented when I was
not performing the- duties'of .the of
fice was being reminded -that I was

the president of the United States. I
felt toward it as a man feels toward
a great function which, in working
hours, he is obliged to perform, but
which, out of working hours, he Is
glad -to get away from and almost
forget and resume the quiet course of
nls own thoughts. I am constantly
reminded as I go about, as I do some
times at the week-end, of the person
al inconvenience of being president of
the United States. If I want to know
how many people live in a email town
all-1 have to do is to go there and
they at once linie up to be counted.
I might, in a census-taking year, save
the census takers a great deal of
trouble by asking them to accompany
me and oount the people on the spot.
Sometimes, when I am most beset, I
seriously think of renting a pair of
whiskers or of doing something else
that will furnish me with an adequate
disguise, because I am sorry to find
that the cut of my jib is unmistakable
and I must sail under false colors if
I am going to sail Incognito.
"Yet, as I have matched my ex
periences with my anticipations, I,
of course, have been aware that
was taken by surprise because of the
prominence of many things to which
I had not looked' forward. When we
are dealing with democratic affairs,
gentlemen, we are dealing with things
that to us as Americans are more or
less calculable. There is a singular
variety among our citisenship, it is
true, a greater variety even than I
had anticipated but, after all, we are
all steeped in the same atmosphere,
we are all surrounded by the same
environment, we are all more or less
affected by the same traditions and.
moreover, we are- working out some

Petrograd. May 17.—(Via London)
—With the advance of Russian forces

line of attack has greatly enhanced
the chances of success of the Russian
campaign in Mesopotamia which
holds forth the hope now enteraln
ed in Petrograd of bringing not only
Bagdad, the Holy City of the Caliphs,
but the entire historic country lying
between the Tigris and the Euphrates
under Russian dominion.
Of the two groups of Russian ar
mies whioh are now threatening Mes
opotamia overland, the one already
mentioned has crossed the Mesopota
mia border and is marching rapidly
toward Mosul. The only serious ob
stacle between It and this goal 'is the
ancient fortified city of Jesireh-Ibn
Omar, on ah island in the Tigris 130
miles southsast of Diarbekr. It Is
believed that the city with its anti
quated defenses will not be able long
to delay the Russian advance. The
progress of these forces already has
broken the backbone of the Turkish
communications between Diarbekr
and Mosul and the Turkish armies
covering these two points are now
separated except, for a circuitous road
too far in the rear to be of much
service.
