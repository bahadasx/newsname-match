JOSHIA KEMPTHORNE
ANSWERSSUMMONS
DEATH OCCUR8 AT HOME OF
DAUGHTER, MRS. HUDSON,
8ATURDAY, MAY 13TH.
FUNERAL SERVICES HELD TUESDAY
Remains Taken to Mt. Vernon for
Interment Today. Wat Promin
ent in Church Circles.
Josiah Kempthorne, eon of Mr.
i*nd Mrs. Joseph Kempthome, was
bom 74 years ago in Cornwell, Eng
land, and died at the home of his
daughter, Mrs. C. K. Hudson, of
Manchester, Iowa, May 13, 1916.
He came to America "with his par
ents as a child of 8 year®, where
they settled first in Illinois and then
in Wisconsin. After hip marriage to
Miss Rebecca Harris he came to Io-
wa, which has been his heme ever
since. For a number of years his
home Jiaa been In Des Moines.
He ia survived by hi# wife and
ft\ four daughters, Mrs. C. K. Hudson
at Manchester, Iowa
ThroujgV a" long, life he labow^jj jpot
for htoosieilf but tor those whom he
loved. With all he had a high sense
of honor in Ms dealings with his fel
low men. He did Justly, loved kind
ness, and walked humbly with his
Gcd and he was not because God
vtspk Wo. He was a liberal contrib
utor to ©very good cause and that
^'-wMch he has given and that which
he has done will be a living mon
mnant for him down the ages for
"their works follow with them". By
that which he has given he has
shown his thankfulness for that
which he has received as woU as his
acknowledgment of Him from whom
all blessings flow.
For many years he hap been a
faithful member of the Methodist
Episcopal church which he dearly
loved as' one branch of Christ's found
ing in the earth. He was interested
in all the activities of the Church
and helped thej» with willing heart
and hand. To him the Christ of the
church was a living experience with
in, sweet and abiding. He has passed
from "chiurch militant to the
church triumphant, which is without
fault before tfce throne of God".
The friends of Trinity church, Dea
Moines, will miss a loved and famil
lar tece, but the influence and the
memory of his life will linger with
them.
When he realized that the end
was near he said that he was not
/'v afraid to die. Why should he have
been afraid? Long ago he had found
the Savior as his own and had
1
trusted him down the years. While
he was not afraid to die as yet he
wished to live, not for himself, but
for his family whom he cherished
with an undying devotion. His was
a father's interest in them all, and
he lived to be a blessing as he was
ap unfiling comfort to them.
Now that he is gone, a thousand
sweet memories crowd for utterance.
His life was like the Path of the
just "that phineth more and more
unto the perfect day". For him the
sting of death has been taken away
through Christ and he has entered
into rest and into life.
While the family is bereaved yet
they are each and all sustained by a
UtU&
Mahoustbb,
example of. an unfaltering
trust. The sadness of parting is
comforted by the glad hope of a
meeting where friends never part and
low.

The big oil-pull tractor and the

this road machinery, one on the en

roads as well as the most efficient
The* engine is also used to haul a

FATHER AND BABY
MEET TRAGIC DEATH
FAMILY HOME DESTROYED BY FLAME
One of the most tragic accidents
took place at Murdo, South Dakota,
last Wednesday, when the home of 'P™"1
on the flames, and that a terrific ex
plosion occurred. The oil was thrown
over Mr. Eaton and before assistance
could reach him his clothing was
ablaze, and his body burned to a
crisp. The flames spread rapidly,
and in their frantic effort to rescue
their little one year old baby Mrs.
Eaton, as well as her husband, re
ceived terrible burns. Firemen fin
ally succeeded in locating the body
of the baby, but not until the little
life had been snuffed out by the
flames.
At last reports it was believed that
Mrs. Eaton would recover.
Charles L. Eaton was born in Dela
ware county, Iowa, March 1, 1882 and
moved to Lyman county in the fall of
1907, locating on a farm south, of
Murdo, where he resided until a cou
ple of years ago when he moved to
town. On March 1, 1911, he was
united in marriage to Miss Lillian
Weigandt and to this union three
children were born, Edna, age four,
Ralph age three and Arthur age 16
months. Mr. Eaton was a successful
farmer and since coming to town,
has been employed on the Eaton
Bros.' dray line, until about six
weeks agu when he went to work for
the White and Parker Hardware Co.,
by which firm he was employed at
thet ^ji$e of Ids death.
The4 depeqped was a quiet, indus
trious young ism ,^r w^ ,#W
one had the utmost* respect. Hon
orable ip. »lL.4ealiDgs,^a. .jn*n bf ex
emplary habits, a' good nefg&bor, Tm«
band and father, his.iggft^ui^ler any
circumstances at Wch an
beetle cause of deep regret and sor
row, in the community and happen
ing as it did it is almost beyond com
prehension.
Besides the wife and two children
the deceased leaves an aged mother
who resides at Rapid City, four sis
ters,, Mrs. Mary Hollister, of We®
slngton, Mrs. Jane Sayler who re
sides about twenty-five miles north
east of Rapid City, Mrs. Rose Pa
trick of Hot Springs, and Miss Annie,
who lives at home with her mother,
in Rapid City three brothers, E. M-,
of Venice, California, T. A. and A.
T., of Murdo. To these bereaved ones
words cannot express the sympathy
that goes out from th« entire com
munity.
MARRIAGE OF GLEN TABER.
Glen E. Taber, son of Mr. and
Mrs. J. W. Taber, of this city, and
Miss Frieda Meyer of Genesee, Ida
ho, were united in marriage at Gene
see, on May 10th, 1916. Mr. Taber
has been making his home at Genesee
for two years, he being a cashier
in one of the leading banks of that
city. Mrs. Taber has been associat
ed with c«e of the newspaper es
tablishnaents of her home city for
seme time. At the present time Mr.
and Mrs. Taber are on a wedding
trip, which takes them to Seattle, T.v
coma, and back to Iowa by one of
the southern routes. They arte ex
pected to arrive in Manchester the.
latter part of the week for a vls
it with Mr. Taber's parents. They,
wtill mako their home at Genesee,
and as they do so the best wishes
of Manchester friends accompany
them.
SUPT. WALKER FAVORS GOOD
SCHOOLS.
The question of a bond issue for
enlarging the public school plant is
before the city of Manchester. It
seems to me that, unlike most vital
issues, this proposition has but one
side. A little investigation will con
vince even the most perverse that
Manchester faces a clear case of
"something must be done". An ef
fort to relieve conditions has been
made by the school board. This ef
fort, splendid as it is, has only serv
ed to convince us that such a method
is intolerable. I feel confident that,
as the issue comes home to the peo
ple of Manchester, it will be met in
the only solvable way that of en
larging the public school plant.
