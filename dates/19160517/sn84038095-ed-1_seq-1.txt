The formal opening and demonstra

last Saturday, was attended by fifteen
hundred people, notwithstanding the
fact that the weather was anything but
desirable. People not only from Deni

ali kinds of soft drinks manufactured.

throughout the building where repre
sentatives from factories demonstrated
Koods which are handled by the Deni

A special invitation was extended
to the children to attend the opening

forenoon, and it is estimated that over
5:50 little folks availed themselves of

was explained and all showed keen in
terest in the machines which are used
ICvery child was given an ice cream
cone, the ice cream being manufac
tured by the Nicholson Ice & Produce
company, and they were allowed to
sample the different flavored soda wa
ters. A whistle was presented to nil
as a souvenir of the occasion.
The entire afternoon and evening
was devoted to the grownups who vis
ited the plant in a steady stream from
1:30 o'clock until after o'clock in
the evening. Many of those present
had never before visited a bottling
works anil were surprised at the mag
nitude of the Denison plant. Compe
tent guides were on hand to escort
them through the fine new building
and explain in detail every department
of the business.
Tin show room on the ground floor
was artistically decorated for the oc
casion and the beautiful soda fountain

ferent extracts used in its manufac

booth where samples of tame and wild
cherry ade were dispensed. The Cher
ry Blossom booth, in charge of Earl
Baum, proved one of the main attrac
tions at the opening.
Hot biscuits, served in a booth lo
cated on the second floor, proved to be
the main attraction for the ladies
present and over 1500 were given out
during the day. The biscuits were
made from Fidelity flour, manufac
tured by the Doud Milling company
here in Denison. S. & M. maple syrup
was served with the biscuits and the

the bottling works, invitations were ex
tended by the Nicholson Ice Ai Pro
duce company and the Doiul Milling

scores of people availed themselves of
this privilege.
At the Nicholson plant special guides
were on hand and guests were taken
through-the immense plant. They
were shown how the artificial ice is
manufactured from distilled water in
a room that was actually so war that
it would seem an impossibility. The
butter making department, cold stor
age rooms, egg packing department,
etc., were thrown open to the public.

SUDDEN DEATH OF
MRS. A1 MEYERS
Entire Community Greatly Shocked at
Sudden Death Which Came on
Tuesday Afternoon.
REMAINS TAKEN TO OSKALOOSA
Healthy Baby Boy Born to Mrs
Meyers Shortly Before He Death.
—Particularly Sad Affair.
The sudden death of Mrs. A. K.
Meyers, which occurred at the family
residence on East Broadway on Tues
day afternoon, lias cast a £ioom over
the entire community. Mrs. Me vers,
who lias been in a delicate condition
for the past few months, was taken ill
Sunday and the premature birtli of a
fine little baby boy caused her death.
Last week she was able to be up town
and only last Saturday assisted her
husband at the bakery, where she
chatted with the customers and seem
ingly was in the best of health. Sun
day morning she attended to the minor
household duties as usual and was in
the best of spirits, laughing and jok
ing with her husband while they were
preparing the noonday meal. She step
ped out of the room and it was only
a few minutes later when Mr. Meyers
heard her fall and found her lying
on the floor unconscious. Supposing
that she had fainted lie tenderly car
ried her to a bed. where he endeav
ored to revive lier, but failing in this
he summoned a physician, but s-hc
never regained consciousness. A doc
tor and two trained nurses were in
constant attendance and everytlr'ng
possible was done to save her, but all
to no avail, and she passed peace
fully away yesterday forenoon. The
death of Mrs. Meyers is particularly
sad, inasmuch as she leaves a bright
healthy baby boy.

Petrograd, .May 1*—Developing a
swift offensive movement in the ex

of Kowanduz, several miles inside the

westward toward the ruins of ancient
Nineveh and the Mesopotamian city

by the Turks they will be threatening
to cut oft the Turkish forces holding
back the British at Kut-el-Amara with
