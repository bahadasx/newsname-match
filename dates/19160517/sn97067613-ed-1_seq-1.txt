The Masonic Temple
Mt. Vernon Lodge, No. 8, F. & A. M.,
held an interesting as well as memorable
meeting last week Wednesday evening.
The occasion was listening to the report
of the soliciting committee and the ap
pointment of a building committee for
the proposed Masonic Temple. The so
liciting committee has been an indefati
gable one, especially so have been Messrs.
G. A. -Wilkins and J, M. Kelley, who
have been the "wheel horses." They have
reason to be proud of the results of their
labors which show the splendid sum of
$8,758 pledged "and the end is not yet"
as there are "more to follow." So en
couraging is this that the lodge has se
lected a building committee, which has
been empowered to procure the site, con
sult architects and in fact proceed with
the erection of the Temple. This com
mittee is given carte blane power to pro
ceed as in their discretion appears fit.
This committee is composed of C. H
Slocum, C. II. A. Stafford, A. H. Slayton,
W. I. LeBaron and C. A. Spiller.
Much enthusiasm was manifested at
the meeting and indications are that it
will not be many days before the plans
are secured and the work started.
After the disposal of the above business
a social hour followed, at which one of
Sulham's famous buffet lunches was
served.

For Village Improvement
.The Village .Improvement Committee
ot the Woman s (Jlub did a little looking
around a few days ago and this inspec
tion suggested to them some practical
ways in which they and the citizens of

fit of all. Look for these suggestions
next week, please, and in the meantime
do some thinking of your own on the
subject and see later how our ideas com
pare. Morrisville as the leading town
in the county should look out for her
laurels in village improvement and see
that other places do not get ahead of her
in this general campaign for betterment.

Death of F. B. Livingston
Word has been received in Morrisville
of the death last week of Fred B. Living
ston, a former resident, in Uakland, Cal.,
of valular heart trouble. The Living
stons moved to California from Morris
ville about 23 years ago. For 21 years
Mr.' Livingston has been engaged in min
ing for gold, silver and copper in Ne
vada'. Mr. Livingston has been ill since
March 1 with valvular heart trouble.

Thomas, daughter of the late Almon D.
Thomas of Morrisville, he leaves two
daughters, Misses Florence and Gertrude
Livingston 'of Oakland, Cal., and one
sister, Miss Agnes Livingston, of Cam
bridge, N. Y.
Mr. Livingston represented Morris
town in the Legislature from 1890-92,
was made chairman of the important
committee on agriculture, became one of
the rnost prominent men in the House
because of bis leadership in the fight to
separate the Agricultural College from
the Ur-V. M, He succeeded in getting
this bill through the House by a very
large majority, it being finally killed in
the Senate after a very bitter contest by
only 2 or 3 votes.
From 1887 to 1891 Mr. Livingston
was manager of the famous "No Name"
base ball club which during that period
was the arknowledgedchampions of this
part of Vermont. In this position Mr.
Livingston madeahost of friends among
the young people of this community.
When the members of this old Club held
its 25th reunion some three years ago,
all the members being then living and
present, a group picture was taken,
which was sent by Thos. C. Cheney to
Mr. Livingston, who in a letter to Mr.
Cheney expressed his great pleasure at
receiving the picture of his "boys." Mr.
LiAingston and "Fud" Gauthier, the 2nd
baseman, are the only members of the
organization who have died.
Fred Livingston was an indefatigable
worker, a splendid organizer, a good
neighbor and citizen and a loyal, true
friend, whose passing will be sincerely
regretted by his many friends in this
community.

Maurice prosecuted. The witnesses for
the state testified that Chase and his
wife went to the school after four o'clock
to get the little daughter of Mrs. Chase,
who was kept after school to get some
lessons. The testimony for the state
tended to show that Chase used abusive
language to Miss Bowen, which was
denied by witnesses lor the defendant.
The jury, composed of VV. F. Sherman,
M. B. White, W. S. Daniels, Allen Phil
lips, VV. II. Towne and F. O. Lunt, re
