The message I would like to
leave with the young inen and
women of America is a menage
I have been trying humbly to
deliver from lecture platform

You can work it into what you'

you from murching straight

you are guided by a linn, driv
iug determination, ami have
normal health and intelligence.
Determination i:i the battery
that commands every road of
life. It is the armor aguiusl
which the missiles of adversity
rattle harmlessly. If there is
one thing I have tried peculiar,
ly to do through these years it
is to indent in the minds of tin*
youth of America the living
fact that when they give 117'/
the reins ami say "Drive!" they
are headed toward the heights, j

properties of a powerful acid;

Conversely, lack of will pow?

arsenal of failure. The most
hopeless proposition in tin'
World is the fellow who thinks
that success is a doorway
through which he will soino
time stumble if he roams around
long enough. Some men seem
to expect ravens to feed them,
the cruse of oil to remain inex?
haustible, the(ish to come right
up over tho nidi? of the boat at
mealtime. They believe that
life is ji series of miracles. They
loaf about and trust in their
lucky star, and boldly declare
that the world owes them a liv?
ing.
As a matter of fact the world
owes a man nothing that he
does not earn. In this life a
man gets about what lie is
worth, and ho must render an
equivalent fur what is given
bun. There is no such thing as
inactive, success.
1 uriiing Points In Young Men's Lives
My mind is running buck
ovei the stories of thousands of
hoys and girls I have known
ami known about, who have
faced every sort of a handicap
and hiivu won out solely by
will nud perseverance i.i work?
ing with all tho power that God
had given them. It is now near?
ly thirty years since a young
Knglish boy came into my of?
fice. Ho wanted to attend the
evening classes at our univer?
sity ami learn oratory.
"Why don't you go into the
law!-" I linked him.
"I'm too poof! I hiivn't a
chance!" he replied, shaking
his head sadly.
1 turned on him sharply.
"Of course you haven't a
chance,'' I exclaimed; "if you
don't make up your mind to
it!"
The next night he knocked at
my door again. Iii? face was
radical ami there was liejit of
determination in his eyes.
"I have decided to I.Dine a
lawyer," ho said- and, I knew
from tho ring of his voice that

for any other reason than ill

Practical Advice to Ambitious Voting
People.
Whenever a yohhg man tells
mo that if lib "had Ins way" lie
would be a lawyer, or an engin?
eer, Or what not, I always re
ply:
"i on can be what you will,
provided that it is something
ttie world will be demanding
ten years hence."
This brings to my mind a cer?
tain stipulation which the am?
bition of youth must, recognize.
You must invest yourself or
your Irionoy in n kiwioi tlYnmii'/,
You must select an occupation
that is titled to your own
special genius ami to some ac?
tual want of the people. Choose
as emiy as possible what your
life work will be. Then you
lain be continually equipping
yourself by reading ami Observ?
ing to a purpose. There arc

There are some people who
think that to he pious they
must be very poor and very
dirty. They are wrong. Not
money, but the /<<>> of money, is
the root of all evil. .Money in
itself is a dynamic force for
helping humanity.
In my lectures 1 have borne

walking over acres of diamonds
and mines of gold. There un?
people who think that their for?

It is much more likely to lie

or on their front doorsteps, bid?

Most of our millionaires dis?

Recently I have been investi?

them have contributed largely
to their communities. But alas!

At :! o'clock the volley ball
game took place between Nor?
ton ami Hig Stone (lap, which
was no doubt the closest and

ly defended their title as cham?
pions of Wise County by do
fcating the home team in an ex?
citing contest by a score of 7 to

strikeout record by punching a
total of 112 batsmen, Kelly get
ling 18 of them to bis credit.
At several stages of tho game
Kelly retired the side by strik?
ing out three men in order. ?>n
account of Lane's sore band,
which was injured in a game
previous to this, Appaiachia
stole bases at will, which count?
ed heavily in the scoring. Kor

Parent-Teachers' Association
Organized at Bij< Stone
Gap.
A praiseworthy movement
deserving of the heartiest sup?
port and co operation of every
tax-payer m Big Stono (lap is
that of the I'arent-Teachers'
Association which was organiz?
ed Friday afternoon, May 13th,
at the school building, (hi ait.
count of the change in the date
after the nbtit.f the meeting
was published in the Post,
I here was not as large attend?
ance as was desired, still it was
fairly representative of the pro?
gressive element of the town.
Prof. A. .1. Wolfe opened the
meeting with a few appropriate
vein irks in support of tho
desirability and need of such
an organi/.at ii in.
Mrs John W. Chalkloy was
elected Chairman, pro tern.
Tilt! Association was original
ly Mrs. Chalk ley's idea und was
iul vacated .by her in a talk at
the patrons' open meeting in
September, seconded by Mrs. D.
1'?. Savers, hut nothing came of
it at the time. Recently, how.
ever, the matter has again been
agitated and it lias seemed that,
some such organization was
imperative, in view of the
growth of the school which now
has an enrollment of seven
hundred pupils.
Mrs. Chulkiey made d short
talk and then called upon Mrs.
Savers to explain more fully
what the Association hoped to
accomplish, and to tell of what
she knew of the work of similar
organi/.at ions in her home state
of Ohio. Mrs. Sayers was fol?
lowed by Miss Nell VanQorder,
of tin- High School Department,
who spokeof the crying need of
a (let 'together movement
among patrons and teachers
and of the isolated way in
which teachers are compelled
to work as regards their
patrons.
" Teachers need co-operation
more than any other class of
workers," Miss VauQ order Stat?
ed, and she went on to say that
one object which she hoped
would be accomplished was the
appointing of Visiting Com?
mittees, changed every month,
and composed of mothers rep.
resenting till of the dllferent
rooms who would really visit
the school regularly and also
visit the homes of tho pupils.
Tho election of officers follow
i ll, each in turn, being made
unanimous. Mrs. ?. B. Sav?
ers, President, Mrs. John \V.
Chalkley, Vice President, Mrs.
Malcolm Smith, Secretary.
A wiser choico of officers
could not have been made. Mrs.
Savers, besides being well in?
formed relative to this move?
ment, has groat oxecutivo abili?
ty, abundant tact, is an en?
thusiastic and progressive
patron of the school and is in?
terested heart and soul in tho
betterment of school and homo
conditions in Hig Stono Gap.
She will tie ably seconded by
Mrs. Uhalkley, who has made a
study of the liest and most ap?
proved methods for the botter
mont of school conditions dur?
ing her frequent visits to Hich
inond, Virginia, and who, as
the wife of a member of the
Hoard of Trustees, with a small
BOO in the primary, is vitally
interested in the school.
Mrs. Smith is also vitally in
torcsted in the school and is al
ready Secretary of Hovornl im?
portant organizations iu town,
which she serves ably and well.
A wise suggestion, which
ne t with general approval, was
that of electing an Advisory
Board ol twelve representative
patrons from different sections
of thi' town to serve during the
fiscal year. As the selection of
! lo se ladies was felt lo bo n
matter requiring grave con?
sideration, a Committee wasap
pointed to proparo a list of
names to present to tho Assoia
tion for consideration at its
next meeting. Mrs. J. L. Mc
Corniiek, who is President of
tho Womans' Civic League,
was appointed Chairman of; this
Column lee, with M iss Nell Van
i lorder and Mrs. A. J. Wolfe.
Mrs. Sayers asked for more
tune before appointing tho
Standing Committees for tho
year, 'fliese Committees are as
follows: Interor Decoration,
S nutation and Health, Press
{Publicity), Truancy ami Tardi?
ness, .Membership, Visitiug
< Home und School).
Al least one teacher will be
appointed on each of these
i loinmittnea, Mrs. Sayers stated.
I'be rogular monthly meeting
of the Association will bo held
on the last Wednesday in each
month, as this seemed to ho tho
most convenient date for both
teachers and patrous. Tho
meetings will continue to bo
hold in the school auditorium.
As it was urgent that another
meeting beheld before tho close
of school to complete the or?
ganization, it was decided to
call l bis meeting on Wednesday
afternoon, May 17th, at half
past three, when it is hoped
that there will be a largo and
enthusiastic attendance of
pat rous from all parts of tho
town, whether they have chil?
dren in school or not, since, iu
any event, they are tax-payers,
ami therefore interested in any
movement'for the good of tho
community at large. Get To?
gether is the sh gan of tho Par?
ent. Teachers' Association, since
'it is solely by co-operation that
all we hope for can be accom
I plished.
