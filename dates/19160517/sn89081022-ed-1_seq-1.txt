May 17—Norway
(From "Our Country," by Bjornson).
A Land there is, lying near far-northern snow,
Where only the fissures life's springtime may know.
But surging, the sea tells of great deeds done,
And loved is the land as a mother by son.
What time we were little and sat on her knee,
She gave us her saga with pictures to see.
We read till our eyes opened wide and moist,
While nodding and smiling she mute rejoiced.
We went to the fjord and in wonder beheld
The ashen-gray bauta, that record of eld
Still older she stood and her silence kept,
While stone-studded hows all around us slept.
Our hands' she then took and away o'er the hill
She led to the church ever lowly and stfll,
Where humbly our forefathers knelt to pray,
And mildly she taught us: "Do ye as they!"
She scattered her snow on the .mountain's steep side,
Then bade on swift skis her young manhood to glide
The North Sea she maddened with scourge of gales,
Then bade her young manhood to hoist the sails.
Of beautiful maidens she gathered a throng,
To follow our daring with smiles and with song,
While she sat enthroned with her saga's scroll
In mantle of moonlight beneath the Pole.
Then "Forward, go forward!" was borne on the wind,
"With forefathers' aim and with forefathers' mind,
For freedom, for Norsehood, for Norway, hurrah!"
While echoing mountains voiced their hurrah.
Then life-giving fountains burst forth on our sight,
Then we were baptized with her spirit of might,
Then gleamed o'er the mountains a vision high,
That summons us onward until we die.

MILITIA COMPANY
AND ARMORY
Commercial Club Takes liilia
the—Col. Lice Talks—A
Sietessful Meeting.
That Willmar should encourage the
organization of a volunteer militia
company at once as the best means
of speedily securing an armory and
the benefits to young' men of our city
which physical training will bring,
was the consensus of opinion at th%
meeting of the Commercial Club last
night, and the committee consisting
of Rev. W. A. Rice, J. H. Nelson and
M. R. Simons was instructed to pro
ceed with the work at once.
Col. Erie D. Luce, of Minneapolis,
Colonel of First Regiment, Minnesota
National Guard, arrived on the evening
train at nine o'clock and gave a talk
on the military situation, the organi
zation of the militia in detail and what
will be necessary to do to secure a
company and armory. He said that
at present there is no vacancy in ex
isting regiments, but there soon may
be. Indeed, the new military law
agreed upon by the conference com
mittees of Congress which quadruples
the number of the trained militia will,
when it becomes law, require that
Minnesota will provide two brigades,
instead of three regiments of infantry,
one of artillery and divisions of naval
militia as at present. When this law
takes effect it is likely that a city the
size of Willmar would be called upon
to raise a company. He thought we
might get two companies if desired.
This law provides that enlisted men
receive a pay of one dollar for each
drill, with slight increases for non-com
missioned officers. The drills are us
ually given certain nights of the week,
from eight to ten o'clock. Officers are
required to spend one evening a week
to study tactics, etc. The armory, es
pecially if centrally located, will be
found a very useful building in a city
to house gatherings of all kinds. The
fact that a large number of applica-
