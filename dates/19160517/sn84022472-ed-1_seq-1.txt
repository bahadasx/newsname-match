Miss McCoy's' long journey may

augural 'trip, , For many years Tier

Inspired with a spirit of social up

' and she loves with patriotic ardor,
, she plans to bring to them the knowl

; eight ; years in America. ' t. - Sh has
bought a piano, which she has al
ready shipped on the first leg of its
long Journey to the island, and-she
plans to give the islanders their first
enjoyment of music upon modern in
struments, upon her return.
' With her- departure, Bridgeport
will lose a hand that has ministered
long and faithfully to the ill; a de
vout and JeYdlng member of the Sev
enth Day Advenidst church-, and per
haps, a potential queen, for though the
principle of popular election is firm
ly, established, the custom of succes
sion also is observed, and Miss Mc
Coy may be her father's successor as
head of her people., - This possibility
J has impelled her to study and effort
J among the American people.
! Though ' Miss McCoy's many ac
quaintances and "patients who have
known hex for a period of eight years
.jin Brdigeport may be surprised as well
as grieved at her , parting, her own
people: will greatly profit by the re
turn. , It will insure for the first time
in 129 years when the island was first
Battled through mutiny, lust, and mur
der, of medical aid. to those Impris
oned in the fastnesses of rock, bound
by thousands of miles of water. In
aQ probability Miss McCoy will never j
.again see western civilization in which
she has studied nursing, medicine and
'dentistry for the last 15 years without
opportunity to return to the land of
Jeer birth.
Her mission here will have been
.completed . and indirectly the , death i
i of her mother win have been a -blessing
to Pitcalrn Island posterity even
at the cost of 5 years of self-abnegation"
and an enforced - expatriation
from her own people by reason of the
.fact that only one. vessel annually
touches on the shores of Pitcaira.
That vessel is a British warship, the
rigid regulations of which preclude
carrying women as passengers, which
tradition is said never to have been
-broken. - . -

London, May 17 Sir Roa-er

Bailey attempted unsuccessfully to
give information to the police - In revl
gara to the projected uprising.
Carter was asked whether he had
heard Bailey say, aer his, arrestthat
yhe had a statement for the'authorities
and that an officer should be sent for.
The constable responded that he Jid
not hear this but that at another ' time
he did hear Bailey sayj f, -
"I have . important ; information
which will give y6u police eomething

produfced ih court yesterday, which
was taken by a diver from- they wreck
of he German steamship Aud, as one
made In the. JlBussian Poula works in
1915. ' The cartridges, -however, - were
not of Russsian make. The inference
drawn by those in court was that part
of the war materials shipped from
Germany consisted of captured Rus
sian rifles, ammunition for which was
made in Germany.
The prosecution then ' called I Lieu
tenant Colonel Gordon, who testified
that the. map which Casement and his
companions brought from Germany
and buried in. the sand was similar to
those made by the German war staff.
It evidently had been reproduced, the
witness said, from the British survey
maps. There ' were certain . spots of
color about the garrisons in Ireland
which were ' not shown on English
maDS. The colonel 'did not know

NEW PUILDING OF
Y. W. G. A. TO BE
ON GOLDEN HILL
That the T. W. C: A. buildfag, for
which a fmnd of more than, $225,000
was raised in this city recently,
through contributions from the pub
lic, will be reared at Golden Hill street
nd Broad street extension park, now
appears a certainty. .
The building committee of the as
sociation virtually has closed nego
tiations with Henry A. and Nathaniel
W. Bishop, owners of the property,
which is now occupied by the Univers
ity club, for the purchase of the land
and buildings at the southwest Junc
tion of the streets. x .
The purchase is contingent upon a
few minor details, the arrangement
of which was said today to be only
matter Of a short time. One of
these is the securing of new quar
ters for the University club, the pres
ont owners wishing not to discom
mode the tenants tnrougn tne pro
posed sale. " The University club has
entered into negotiations for the Dun
ham residence, at Golden Hill and
Harrison street, as a suitable home
following the sale of the present club
house, i . :
The Ps for the new building j
have not yet been drawn,, because the :
purchase of the site has not been
completed, and the style of building
will depend,' largely, upon the sur
roundings. The members of the site
committee look with favor on the
University club . location as suitable,
because it is" central, near the rail
Toad' station,, and business 'activities,
and at the same time Is in a residen
tial neighborhood.
.The plan, originally, of rearing a
structure that would house a large
cafeteria, dormitory and administra
tion buildings, has been somewhat
amended. - y
There was a question as to the pro
vision for the East Side, unti the
purchase of the Burritt property in
Barnum avenue provided a suitable
place for a cafeteria and East Side
donmitories.
Jvow it is planned to have the ad
ministration offices and large dormi
tories and cafeteria in the new build
ing in the center, leaving" the East
Side branch with a cafeteria and dor
mitories as well. In this way both
parts of the city wil be served.

The property is rich in associations
with the early history of Bridgeport.

San Antonio, May 17 The rescue by
the American soldiers of Jesse Deemer
and the negro cook, Monroe Payne,
carried off as. prisoners by the bandits
that raided Glenn Springs and Bo
qulllas, was reported to Major General
Funston today.
Washington.' Mav 17. Genuine relief
over the 'Mexican situation was-, evi
dent in administration circles today.
The principal cause was the assurance
conveyed to President Wilson and his
cabinet yesterday through Secretary
Baker that the Carranza government
now is convinced . the United States
has no, intention of intervening in
Mexican policies and that consequent
ly resentment against tne punitive
expedition is rapidly decreasing.
General Scott, chief or stair or tne
army, brought this word to Secretary
Baker from his conference at EH Paso
with General Obrefeon, war minister
for the tarranza government. Among
the promises made by. Obregon with
the approval of Carranza at the -conclusion
of the conference were these:
"Ten thousand selected Mexican
troops were to patrol the territory
about Parral, the southermost locality
from which American troops are be
ing drawn, and to search diligently for
Villa or his bandits.
"A strong Mexican force was to try
to capture the Glenn Springs and Bo
quillas raiders in the Big Bend dis
trict and ,to liberate Deemer, the
American storekeeper carried off by
the bandits. '
"No Mexican troops were to be
rioved from Sonora state through Pul
pit Pass to the rear of General Per
shing's column."
General Scott's . part of the informal
pact did not include any promises of
American troop withdrawal at a defi
nite time. General Scott expressed
the opinion that Carranza and his war
minister have ordered speedy troop
movents In an attempt to carry out
their pledges. 1

$312.75 by Judge Walsh in the com
mon pleas court this morning after
her, suit against Assistant Manager
Herbert A. Budlong of the American
Graphophone Co. had been heard.
She asked for $400 damages. ,
The plaintiff, - who was the- first
wife of the factory official, said that
on Sept. 1, 1915, $300 alimony was
due and unpaid. She declared Bud
long had signed an agreement ' to pay
her $75 a month during her lifetime
so long as she remained unmarried.
Attorney I. J. Cohn, representing
Budlong, declared this morning that
his client had heard Mrs. pudlong
was married to a man named Bruel
in Belmont, Va. ' Attorney Robert G.
DeForest, counsel for Mrs. Bu.dlong,
denied this. He said Mrs., Budlong
had been annoyed by agents of her
former husband continually spying on
her. Mrs. Budlong stated in her com
plaint that she is still single.
Budlong declared that at-the time
his wife got her divorce she was
awarded $2,000 alimony. He agreed
to pay her $75 a month instead of
giving her the lump sum but he Bays
she promised to have the $2,000 Judg
