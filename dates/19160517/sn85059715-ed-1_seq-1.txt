SHETTER STRONG
FOR LEGISLATURE
PRESIDENT REPLIES
TO POPE'S MESSAGE
Fred E. Slicttor.
Fred E. Slietler, whose plcturo Is given horewlth, In a Republican candl
duto for the House of Delegates, llo Is not as well known throughout tlioj
county as some of the other candidates but his Bupportora are among the
most Influential men of the Bcvoral districts.
Mr. Shetter Is a resident of Union district. Is married and has a family.
He 1b connected with tbe oil business as a ganger and was, until the death
of his partner, Clark Gaston, a merchant at Mineral.
Mr. Shetter is a man of wide general education; a keen student of state
and county affairs; Interested warmly In educational matters; favors careful
legislation that will promote the widest possible economical development of
our nvilral resources; improvement of stock raising through better breeding;
continued and greater help to the splendid efforts that aro being made for
the wider agricultural development of our state, and good roads of a kind,
and financed in a way, that Is satisfactory to the people who pay the bills.
At the time of his birth, which occurred 42 years ago, his parents resided
in Hancock county in the northern panhandle where his paternal grand
father had established a manufacturing plant and foundry shortly aftor the
Mexican war. Prom this Banie county, also, Mr. Shetter'B father, Egbert P.
Shetter, enlisted at the beginning of the Civil war In the First regiment
of West Virginia volunteers. Old soldiers will recall that remnants of the
First and Fourth regiments were joined together to form a new Second regi
ment. Of this latter regiment tbe father was an officer at the muster out In 1865.
?Mr. Shetter's friends seem to think that he would make a most satisfactory
representative even though he has the old-fashioned notion that a hired
man Is still a hired-man whether his Job is helping to make laws or helping
to dig potatoes.
Exchange of Notes is Said to
Bear Only Remotely on the
Subject of Peace.
?BY ASSOCIATED PMCOH)
WASHINGTON, May 17.?Presi
dent Wilson has replied to the mes
sage sent him recently by Pope Ben
edict in which the pope expressed
the earnest hope that war between
the United States and Germany
would not be precipitated by the sub
marine issue and conveyed the im-,
prossion that he hoped tho United
States might be of assistance ulti
mately in restoring peace to Europe.
The reply of the president was con
veyed through Monsignor Bonzano, i
the apostolic delegate here, who do-;
livered the pope's message at the
White House.
White House officials refused to
day to discuss the pope's message or
the reply of the president, but in oth
er quarters It was indicated that the!
exchange of messages had only ie-i
motely to do with the question of
peace in Europe.
The president is understood to have
informed the pope that ho was very
glad to keep tho United States out of
war and would do everything possi
ble, consistent with mainlining the
honor and rights of tho United States.
Neither message will be made pub
lic.
At the White House it was said
that nothing was known of the mis
sion to this country of Secretary
Grew, of the American embassy In
Berlin, who is now on hia way to the
United States. It has been suggested
that possibly he might be bringing a
message from Emperor William to
President Wilson*
