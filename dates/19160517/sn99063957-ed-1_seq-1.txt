Suspected
Portland, Ore., May 17. An ex-convict
was sought by police and deputy
Uieriffs throughout Oregon today on the
belief tli at he was the fiend who swung
ft 11-pound sledge hammer and crushed
the skull of Mrs. Helen Jennings while
(lie slegt Monday night.
Mrs. Jennings' body was discovered
in her home between Tualatin ami Sher
wood, 15 miles from Portland, lute yes
terday. Outside tho house stood "the
automobile of Fred Eistmnn, a jitney
driver. The machine was blood soaked
ind Ristman was missing. Detectives
Relieve the murderer killed Ristmnn and
bid his bodv on the theory that "dead
lien tell no tales."
This ex-convict is known to have
tried to force his attention on Mrs. Jen-
i.ings.. She frequently expressed fear
of him.
"I would not have him angry at me
for anything in the world," she told a
neighbor recently.

if.iin George A. (lore. Mrs. J. H. Wilson
of Salem, and Mrs. E. II. Bobiiuon o'f

Oi'o convinced. The murder apparently;
was carefully planned. At S p. ni4iloii

Inside the bed. A single blow, nnd a
terrific, one, hud crushed her head flat.
The murderer evidently gained ent
rance to the house through a window.
Officers believe Ristmnn was murder
ed before arriving ut Mrs. Jennings'
home, nnd that tho murderer disposed
of. his body along tho road. The blood
on the automobile was in the back of
