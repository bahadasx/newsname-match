Washington, May 16. An optimis
tic view of the Mexican border situa
tion wax laid before President Wilson
ami his cabinet today by Secretary
Maker, (liter n long conference with
Major Scott, chief nf staff, (leneral
CaiTanza. and his advisors now under
stand the motives of the Washington
government more fully than ever be
fore, as (i rctiult of the conference at
Kl Paso of (Jeneral Scott, (leneral
Funston and (Jeneral Obregon, Mr.
Haker was able, to tell the cabinet and
tension along the international line
has greatly relaxed.
(leneral Scott believes that the
whole situation Is less acute than it
has been at any time since the raid on
Columbus, N. M.
Mexico's Fears Allayed.
General Obregon, it is learned, en
tered the conference with much ap
prehension as to the real purpose ot
General Pershing's swift march deep
into Mexico In pursuit of Villa and
his raiders. In Mexico, he said, it
seemed as though a great force armed
with cannon and all the impedimenta
war could not lie moving merely in
pursuit of one bandit chieftain and hi-,
handful of followers. Undoubtedly
Obregon reflected fears felt In .Mex
ico City that the expedition was in
reality a step toward intervention by
the United States.
The American conferees were able
to convince the Mexican war minister,
an( through him, (Jeneral Carranza,
that President Wilson's announcement
of the purpose of the expedition told
the whole story; that its mission was
only as described to pursue or cap
ture the hkndlU) and return across
the line. The striking accomplish
ment of (lenerals Scott and Funston
lay in tho fact that they succeeded in
doing this without making- any pledges
a to when American troops would bo
recalled.
Pledges Carried Out.
The change In General obregon's
views was clearly Indicated by prom
ises he made at the conclusion of the
conferences, promises approved by
General Carranza and which lie is
now carrying out with promptitude
and vigor, according to official re
Ports from army officers and consu
lar officials in Mexico. It is these
pledges which are interpreted as
forming an unwritten agreement.
The include the following:
That 1(1,000 picked troops tinder
General Trevino, thp ablest of Car
ranza field commanders, occupy and
police the territory around Parral, the
southern limit of (Jeneral Pershing's
"ive, and in other districts where
there are no American troops.
Patrol on Mexican Side.
That an effective putrol be thrown
about the Mexican side of the Rig
Hend region of the Texas border to
head off the Glenn Springs and Bo
uuillos raiders; that every effort be
niade to liberate JJeemer, the Ameri
can storekeeper captured and carried
away by the bandits; and that no
troops be moved from the forces in
Konora state through Pulpit pass to
operate in tho rear of General Per
sing's force.
While General Scott, for his part,
made no promises as to withdrawal
and very clearly stated to General
Obregon that United States troops
would stay in Mexico until Carranza
forces had fully demonstrated their
"bility to handle tho bandit situation,
Assurances were given that American
troops would not operate in parts
where Carranza forces were active.
This will be done to avoid tho pos
sibility of clashes, and for the same
reason no attempt to co-operate troop
movements will be made unless it be
ly arrangement. of the local comman
ders, American and Mexican.
Kt-ott Is Convinced.
General Scott said today that re
cent reports of Carranz;i tr.oop move
ments in tho region south of General
I'ershing, in his opinion, showed that
General Obregon's orders were being
carried out promptly. While the
movements had been given sinister
significance in border dispathces, the
chief of staff indicated that he had
reason to believe they were in fact
nly the disposition of General Tre
vino's men in accordance with Gen
eral Obregon's promisee.
General Obregon was in constant
communication by telegraph during
the conference, General Scott report

wa announced that there was no
change in the situation. Administra
tion officials already had a brief tele
graphic outline of the results of the
military conference. A full apprecia
tion of the reassuring character of
the discussions, however, was not felt
until General Scott's verbal report
was transmitted to the cabinet by
Secretary linker. It was stated posi
tively that the question of possible In
tervention was not discussed by the
president and his advisers, and that,
on the contrary, official reports indi
cated that slow but steady progress
was Wing made by the de facto gov
ernment in readjusting the revolution
shaken republic.
( an aiiii Still Silent.
General Scott does not contemplate
preparing a written report on his
mission to Kl Paso. He has no en
gagement to confer with Secretary
Lansing, hut it is considered certain
state department officials will ac
quaint themselves fully with his views
and information before proceeding
with diplomatic negotiations with
Mexico City. That discussion may be
delayed some time. Klisco Arredon
do, Mexican ambassador-designate,
sought instructions from General
Carranza immediately after the Kl
Paso conference ended. He has re
ceived no reply- This Is taken hern
to mean that (Jeneral Carranza may
intend to await tho fulfillment of
General Obregon's promises before re
newing his suggestion that American
troops be withdrawn.
The question of the use of the
Mexican railways by American troops
is outside the general discussion.
Army officials believe it of vital im
portance that the full use. of the lines
be secured before the rainy season
sets in, but as yet tho state depart
ment has made no move toward re
newing Its request nor has the war
department ur",ed that such steps W
taken.

JUDGE RETIRES FROM
WESTERN PACIFIC CASE
( HOMINC JOURNAL (PROAi LtAMO WIRll
San Francisco, May 16. Important
developments, preliminary to the
forthcoming contest over the forth
coming foreclosure sale of the West
ern Pacific railway took place in the
United States district court. First was
the announcement by Judge William
C. Van Fleet of his voluntary retire
ment from the case following his vin
dication yesterday by the United
States circuit court of appeals on
charges of bias and prejudice against
the. interests of majority bondhold
ers. Refore retiring from the case Judge
Van Fleet granted the application of
the Savings Union Hank & Trust com
pany of San Francisco to intervene in
the foreclosure suit. This company
represents the minority bondholders
who own $3,500,000 of the railroad s
first mortgage bonds, and its inter
vention means that the minority In
terests will have a say in the deter
mination of the "upset" price of the
road. The minority, it has been s at
ed will seek the fixing of us high a
price as possible probably upwards
of $40,000.000 and will be opposed
by tho majority bondholders, repre
sented bv the Equitable Trust com
pany of New York, and the reorgani
zation committee.
The claims of the intervenors will
be given further consideration on Fri
day when Judge Maurice T. Pooling
assumes the adjudication of the case
in place of Judge Van Fleet.

In the White house, ,nd his lmpro
slons of foreign and domestic prob

night before Washington correspond
ent gathered at the. National Pr?ss
club. He spoke of the difficulties of
the presidency and particularly of
the motives wghlch have ifuldod hli
handling of tho European situation.
"America," the president said, "la
for pence because she love peace, and
believes the present war has carried
the nations engaged so far that they
cannot lm held to ordinary standards
, of responsibility."
I Rut, he added, the fnlted States has
'grown to he one of tht great national

Unit Is the only basis on which he
will respect me, then for the sake of
his soul I have, got to occasionally
knock him down."
The president declared he had been
kept awako nights . considering the
, European situation because there
I might como a time when the United
I Slates would have to do what I Old
riot desire to do, and "the great bur

'has been up to me to choose when
that time came.'' He added that he
did not conceive ' thijt he had been
elected president to do as he pleased

have to make a speech. One of the
leading faults of you gentlemen or ine

other men talk, to draw them out
upon all occasions, whether they wish
to bo drawn out or not. I remember

have followed. I must say that the
forecast has been very largely veri

then have been deepened rather than
