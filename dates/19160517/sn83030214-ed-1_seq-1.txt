j to tho members of the National Presa

President's seeond appearance at tho
club, of whieh he is a member, and
to whieh President Taft was a frequent
viaitor, and, as on the firat occasion,
three years ago, he spoke rather
freely. and then, being pressed, con
sented to the publicatron of hia re
marks.
From ths reason.. why Amerca
should keep out of the war. and how,
to his 'nrofound intellectual con?
tempt" for reactionary pol'ticians, the
address was an intimata revelation o?
the human side of the Chiof r'xecutive.
The Preaident told of the difficulty of
estimating popular sentiment. of know?
ing what the people want done.
"I am not here to do what I plea?e,"
he said. "If I were. it would have
, been much more interesting tiian it
' has been."
Some Must Be Sat On.
Referring to international questions,
he evplained that it was often neces

l.as an imperfect mora! understanding,

Diacouragements of dealing with

Had Fourteenth Century Maps.
But Sir Roger's plans, aceordtaf
to evidence intr. .y, weret
not quite as moden as (iermany'a
latest undersea tighting c-aft. The
General Staff of tba Iriah "R?pub
lican army" was not as well equipped
as its (ierman prototype fof its cam
paipn. The maps 011 whuh Sir
Rojjer Casement planned his ria?injj
were those nf the fourteenth cen?
tury.
After ihe hearing had been in prog
ress for some time, Casement turned
his attention from the testimony to
the writing of a long sta'rment. It
was while thus engaged that he showed
marked emotion, for the Bral time
since thr hearing began. Whatevor
was the nature of his thoughts, they
were such that they moved him to
t.-ars. Hr wept quietiy as he worked
away with his pencil. I* was a strik
ing change from the smiling and self
confident man of a short time before.
The most interesting testimony of
the day was the story ot the fate of
the (ierman ghip Aud, sent out from
Kiel with arms and ammunition tn
fulftl in part German promtses of as
gistanee.
The Aud was heid up on suspicion oft
the west coast of Ireland not far from
Tralee by the British naval patrol ship
Bluebell, and was being taken to
Queenstown when ghe wj sunk by her
own crew. Details of tka eapture and
? nkir.g were given by Sidney Wag
horn, a signalman OB the Bluebell, who
said:
"Karly Good Fnday morning tho
Bluebell w?_ on patrol duty off tho
southwest -*??? of Irela-d whea wo
sighted a ship fiying the NorwofUr,
colors. We signailed her and asked
who ghe wag and where she w?i bound.
She replted that she was the Aud,
bound from Bergen for Genoa. At that
time we were about IM miles weit of
yueenstovsn.
The Aud Slips It.i ( aptore.
"We ordered the Aud to follow us.
but she d'd not do so until we tired a
shell. Then she proceeded with us.
"When we got near Daeat'l Rock tha
Aud stopped her engines. The Blue?
bell was then a cable's length away
from her, and we gaw whito amok.
conung from her afterhold. Two Ger?
man ensigns wero run un on her mast
head. The Aud lewered two boats,
which were rowed toward the Bluebell.
Wa ' r<*d around these boats. They flew
laga of truce and the occupanta put
up their hands. They were mada pris
oners. They proved to be nineteen or
twenty German blucjackets. with threo
officers. Ten minutes Iater the Aud
sank. about a mile and a quarter from
the lightsbip."
Waghom was followed on the atand
by a diver, who inspected the wreck
of the Aud tO confirm the statement
that she had arms ard ammunition
aboard. It waa elaimed that she car
' jrn rifoa for the rehels, bendes
other war material
?The Aud lay in about etghteen fath
oms 'of water." tho dr. er said. "She
ha.l the Norwegian flag painted on her
hall. I found a hole in her side, 12
or II feet in diameter. <>n the bed
of the aea I saw a lot of rifles and
ammunition."
