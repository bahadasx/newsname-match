IMtf
tints of Neighboring Towns.
While on a visit to Campbellsville
and Greensburg, last week, a News
man was impressed that these two
good railroad towns were experiencing
a dull season, as well as Columbia.
The farmers are all busy, putting in
their crops, Beuce they can not spare
the time that it would require to visit
the metropolis of their respective
counties. The merchants were tak
ing the situation philosophically,
knowing that if the farmer failed, all
would come up lacking. In a few
weeks trade will open with the local
merchants, and wltji pleasure they
look forward to that time. The Bap
tist and Christian denominations of
Campbellsville are looking forward to
two big days in religious circles the
dedication of their new church build
ings, which will take place this sum
mer. Campbellsville is spreading and
it is only a question of short duration
when many fertile meadows, in the
suburbs of the town, will have to be
turned into building lots. While in
the latter place we heard two very
able sermons, one by Rev. J S. Chand
ler, of the Methodist Church, the oth
er by Rev. Link, pastor of the Presby
terian Church. In making inquiry we
found that Eld. W. G. Montgomery,
whcis the pastor of the Christian
- Church is very much liked by his peo
ple and the citizenship generally.
Rev L C. Kelly, who is the pastor, of
the Baptist Church, is an energetic,
religious worker, and is doing much
good for the cause he represents
For. courtesies extended, a deligniful
auto ride to the water works and
points In the city, the writer is in
debted to Mr. R J Lyon, who from
youth up, has been his steadfast friend.
John E. Gowdy was in his usual jovial
spirit, and we enjoyed the short time
spent in his company. A long time
ago, before John, J. O. Russell, W. I.
Header were married, the writer ac
companied them "to the Ohio river
We stopped at the Fif th Avenue Ho
tel, Louisville, and were assigned a
large room containing beds for all
John had a lady friend in the city, I
think" she was formerly of Taylor coun
ty, and he had notified her that he
would be in Louisville the evening of
our arrival and would call at her
home. But we all went to a theater,
and John forgot his engagement.
Early next morning there was a knock
at our door, and it was opened by the
writer who received a note directed to
Mr. Gowdy. I informed John that I
had an epistle for him, and he said,
"read it." It was from the young la
dy, and she scored him for breaking
his engagement, keeping her up until
a late hour. There was never a more
sorrowful looking man. He dropped
his head, and seemed in deep medita
tion. Gently placing my hand upon
his shoulder, he needed consolation, I
quoted:
"Be still sad heart and cease repini ng.
Beyond the clouds the sun is still shining;
Thy fate is the common fate of all
Into each life some rain must fall
Some days must be dark and dreary."
He raised his face, a bright express
f -ixm having appeared, and thinking the
one who brought the note was stand
ing in the hall, waiting for an
answer, he said, in a very command
ing voice, "Tell that boy to bring
me some Blue Lick water."
The smallpox scare at Campbellsville is
over, and in a very short time every
boJy will be down to business. We
Tound the News-Journal on rising
ground. Mr. Rhoades, an experienced
newspaper man, wno was recently em
ployed in Ohio, has taken a position
on the paper and will use his best"
endeavors in making for Campbells
Tille and Taylor county a live publica
tion At Greensburg Wood Lewis was
the busiest man about town. He is an
extensive advertiser, and knows the
value of printer's Ink. While in con
versation with him he said, "Isold
X$t buggies last week, and I attribute
vthe sales direct to the Adair County
News I get more than value for ev
ry dollar I spend with your paper
Passing around the square at Greens
burg we met and had a few pleasant
moments with Dr. B. M. Taylor, who

physicians. He is also the State Sen

jHwifiter- Dr. J J Booker was leok
iagvmtll and. informed us that he was
doing a very good practice, ind
that he frequently had calls
from his old beat, the Miami section.
Post Master Montgomery was looking
in fine spirits. He said that he was
using" no Wood now, that the farmers
were Rowing for corn and that Wilson
was grinding in the bottom,, but every
body would be for Woodrow Wilson in
November, that is, a suffloient num
ber for his election. John A. 'Hobson
and Fount Pendleton were buying cat
tle and hogs, John and Clarence
Taughan were employing their usual
politeness at their old stand. Lapsley
Wilson was handing out drugs, and the
Green River House furnishing apetiz
ing food to the traveling public
Speaking of houses of entertainment,
a few words in praise of the New Mer
chant Hotel, Campbellsville, and the
Campbellsville Hotel is clue the genial
proprietors Walter Hoskins runs the
first-named, and he is a born hotel

iness and serves very delightful meals,
and is exceedingly accommodating.
Bram Beard runs the latter hotel, is
doing a good business, and has quite a
number of regular boarders, and gets a
fair share of the traveling public.
Mr. J. T. Barbee, Jr., Dead.
News was received by relatiyes here,
last Thursday, that Mr. J. T. Barbee,
Jr., who lived in Louisville, was dead,
the end coming about the noon hour
that day. He was a victim of a can
cer, and was about forty-seven years
old. He was a member of the Baptist
Cljurch here until he removed to
Louisville, when his membership was
transferred to oneof the city churches.
His funeral was largely attended, and
the interment was in Cave Hill Cem
etery Friday. He leaves a wifeand an
aged father and a number of relatives
in Columbia and several in Taylor
county. The deceased had a number
of friends in this place, all of whom
were sorry to hear of his demise,
though they knew he could not live.
Those who were near and dear to him
should not mourn, as his affliction
baffled the skill of physicians, and he
was an intense sufferer. "
Notice to Traveling Opticians.
As it is a violation of the law to

Mr. R. W. Shirley came very near
losing his left eye last Wednesday
morning. He was at home and was
passing through a gate with some
stock. He struck a mule colt that
was lagging behind, with a switch, the
animal kicking him in the eye, and it
is a miracle that the sight was not de
stroyed. Mr. Shirley came to Colum

Columbia High School Closes.
This year ended by far the best sess
ion of the Columbia Graded and High
School since Its organization.
Seven years ago the school began
with 127 students on the first day, and
5 students in the high school depart
ment During the first year of the
school there were about 200 enrolled.
The school has had a steady growth
since its organization. Last year
there were 271 enrolled ingrades and
high school and 39 enrolled. In high
school. There have been .enrolled this
year 328 in grades and high school and
59 in high school.
The closing events began with two
plays given by piipils of the grades.
These were well renderedand reflected
credit on all who took part They
have beenmentioned previously in the
paper. Field Day was a great success,
a large crowd being present to witness
the various contests.

.Christian
exercises
were held. The two orations deliver
ed by Mr. Paul Hamilton and Miss
Nannie Faulkner were as good as have
been heard in Columbia from high
school pupils. Dr. Mitchell, vice pres
sdent Georgetown College, who deliv
ered the commencement address, paid
the class a very high compliment, in
saying the orations were as good as he
had heard in Kentucky from high
school pupils. Dr. Mitchell's
address throughout was splendid.
He made many splendid points in
showing the value of an education.
He inspired all who heard him and he
was often interrupted by applause.
It would not. be proper to close this
article without paying "a compljment
to those of our town who assisted at
all the commencement exercises in
rendering the beautiful music. Co
lumbia's best musical talent made all
the events in which they took part
much more enjoyable than they could
otherwise have been;
With the closing of this year ends
the services of Prof. W. M. Wilson as
superintendents, Mr Wilson was the
organizer of the school and has been
its superintendent since its organi
zation, except for the two years he
was In Monticello, Ky. He will go to
his new field of work as Superintends
ent City Schools, Portales, N. M. Mr.
Abuer, a man of wide experience, will
succeed him as superintendent here
and we believe he will be able to keep
the good work moving forward which
Mr. Wilson has so 'well done while
with us.
Fourth Generation
The Mothers' Day services at the
Presbyterian church last Sabbath was
unique, but was unique in that four
generations of one family were repre
sented. Mrs. Easter Dohoney, two
children, three grand children, and one!
great grand daughter, Mary Walker
Flowers. The last named received
the right of baptism.
Prof Jas. R. Abner, who recently

cessful term since the school started,
seven years ago.

All the services at the Methodist
church last Sunday forenoon, were
beautiful. The occasion was a bacca
laureate discourse by Dr. A. P. Lyon,
of Louisville, tc the graduating class
of the Lindsey-Wilson Training School,
andhls theme was "Following Christ."
He pictured the life of oui Savior
while upon earth, in tender and touch
ing language, and his advice to the
class, now that they were better pre
pared than ever before, to accomplish
something in life, was splendid. No
fault said he could be found to the
manner of livingof the lowly Nazarine,
for when the bright light was turned
on His life, the more you turned
the brighter it appeared, a star, and
he advised the class to follow it.
He gave seltishuess a rap, saying
that he who lived for himself accom
plished but little in this world, and he
might have added but little hope
after death.
Taking it altogether it was oneof
the best discourses delivered in Co
lumbia for many a day, and to one of
the largest audiences. He also preach
ed an able sermon Sunday night.
