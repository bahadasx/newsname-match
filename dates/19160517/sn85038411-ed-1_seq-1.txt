LATE RETURNS
POINT TO VICTORY
FOR PENROSE MEN
Rut Governor Brumbaugh's
Managers Claim Forty-one
Delegates For Him
COUNT IS VERY SLOW
Kephart and Snyder Win; Gov
ernor and Penrose Poll
Big Vote
Primary returns from less than half!
of the fi.S? 1 election districts in the
State of Pennsylvania were available
late this afternoon. Consequently
speculation was rife from one end of
the State to the other about how Gov- j
ernor Brumbaugh and Senator Pen
rose were going to fare in the election
of the twelve Republican delegates at
large. The two men were taken as the
leaders in the vote and the interest in
this fight dwarfed everything else.
Associated Press dispatches at a late
hour this afternoon indicated victory
for the Penrose forces in their cam
paign for national delegates and party
organization control.
Penrose claims were largely based
on the fact that in Philadelphia the
faitions shared alike in the twelve
high men for delegate at large, the
Penrose people saying that the rest of
the State would overwhelm their op
ponents. Partisans of the senator
claimed that his whole slate had gone
through with Snyder and Kephart for
the two State offices and frago. Gar
land. Scbe! and McLaughlin for con
gressmen at large.
From Penrose headquarters in
Philadelphia it was unofficially -stated
this afternoon that if t)ie Brumbaugh
forces elected fifteen of the seventy
six delegates in the state they would
be fortunate. It was also said that in
all likelihood Governor Brumbaugh
wii; be one of the delegates at large.
On the other hand. Paul X. Furman,
who had been directing the Governor's
campaign, said this afternoon that he
is compiling data for a statement
which will contain figures to show
that Brumbaugh delegates to the num
ber of forty-one out of seventy-six
have been elected. He backed up 'his
assertion by declaring that the Gov
ernor had won eight delegates in
Philadelphia and five in Allegheny. He
also said that the Governor had won
a delegate in Luzerne county, whsre
he had no expectations, and from the
Governor's office it was said that a
telfgram received from Congressman
Griest. the Lancaster leader, was to
the effect that the Governor, for dele
gate at large, had polled 7,000 out of
8,500 votes cast. From other sources
it was teamed that Senator Penrose
had polled about an equal number.
The Palmer Democrats won all over
the State over the Old Guard.
The I-atest Figures

ceived at 3 p. m. show returns from
2,72S districts out of 6.591 in the State

Veteran Ferryboat
Grounded on Sands
' In the middle of the river, just oppo
i site Kelker street, rests quietly un
| moving the familiar bulk of the vet
i eran ferryboat that is accustomed to
, ply its way between the eastern and
western shores of the Susquehanna,
connecting Harrisburg by water with
West Fail-view and Enola.
All day long it has rested there, the
only sign of life on board being the
smoke that occasionally curls upward
j from its smokestack. Like a shipwreck
cast upon the shores of an island tiiat
has suddenly sprung up treacherously
in the middle of the sea, the old stand
by is sticking fast in the sand and coal
bank that but recently, when the Spring
freshets receded, rose from the basin
of the rlyer and took possession of
about 200 yards or more of the ferry
boat's watery route. The brisk winds
!of thin morning were probably re
sponsible for driving the ferryboat on
to the bank, where it still rests.

Here's Your Chance to
Learn About Preparedness
The I larrisburg Chamber of Com
merce to-night will conduct a public
meeting at the Technical high school
auditorium when both sides of "Pre- j
paredness" question will be discussed i
by authorities of eminent reputation, i
Henry A. Wise Wood of New York,
one of the most noted inventors, man- ]
ufacturers and engineers in the coun
try will explain the very comprehen
sive plan of preparedness both civil '
and military that is being put under;
way by different associations in the 1
country organized for that purpose.!
Prof. Isaac Sharpless, of Haverford j
College will explain the attitude of the
pacificists towards "Preparedness,"
which, of course, is somewhat opposed
to those of men of Mr. Wood's type.
In a large display advertisement in
to-day's newspapers the officers and
committee of the I'hamber Invite the'
public to attend this meeting free* of!
< harge anil also ask the public to show !
its general interest in "Preparedness"!
by attending the meeting in large
numbers. The Chamber points out '
whereas 150,000 people marched all I
day Saturday in New York to evidence j
their personal interest in "Prepared- i
ness," the Chamber only requests 1,000 |
Harrisburgers to spend a couple of 1
hours in comfortable chairs hearing!
two noted men bring both sides of
