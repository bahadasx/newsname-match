SUIT PROVES TO

Wife Alleges in Complaint That Dur

Help Him la Bis illegal Baaaness;
Hosbaad, In AfflrUrtt, Says -rife
Actuated by Wis for Moar.
Echoes of Pendleton's previous
dry regime are to be found in the In
creasingly sensational divorce ease of
Rose Bogert va. W. O. Bogaxt which
has been started In the circuit court
and which promises to be bitterly
contested.
Mrs. Bogert In her complaint
charged that, during the previous dry
years in Pendleton, her husband was
in
the bootlegging busineaa and
1 made 110,000 during one year
She
imving made jiu.ouo in one year.
However, he declares his wife
I oowever, ne declares his wife was a
Party to the transaction of her own
will and desire to make money.
In an affidavit which she filed yes-
j terdav Mr mplm ner pre
; vlous accusations.
She avers that her
husband built a large cellar at their
house during the other dry term and
received liquor in barrels by the four
horse load. He required her. she
says, to draw it from the barrels,
mix a half gallon of water to every
two gallons of whiskey and add some
coloring matter and brown sugar.
This mixture, she says, he required
her to bottle and send down town to
him. She alleges she performed this
operation at his dictation hundreds of
times.
In his affidavit Mr. Bogert answers
nearly all of the charges his wife
makes in her complaint. He denies
he was domineering, unkind and ab
usive. He admits having had a con
versation with her recently ln which
he offered to buy her and her oldest
daughter tickets to California and
give them $100. but states that on the
following morning for the sake of their
young children he offered to live In
a separate part of the house and give
her $50 a month for the support of
herself and daughter.
He charges In the affidavit that she
has been too intimate with other men.

J. R. Childreth and Ed Brunks tell of
having seen Mrs. Bogert drive up to
the Alta House and pick up another
man. One from F. E Ring, another
reighbor. is to the effect that Mr. Bo
gert always conducted himself about
home in a quiet and kind manner.
In her affidavits Mrs. Bogert admits
having ridden in her auto with Clar
ence Potter on several occasions but.
j always she says, with her daughter or
otners present and she denies ever
having had intimate relations with
him or other men. Relative to her
visits to the room over her cellar she
states that the room Is occupied by
James Riley, an employe of her hus
band, and that such visits as ens
made were at the request of her hus
band and in connection with his ills,
sal operations
Moreover, she states that her hus
band now has much liquor In his cel
lar and has ,.n several occasions sine
the first of the year had some of It
moved to his place of busineaa. Her
daughter. Zua. makes affidavits that
he tried to have her small hroth..r
