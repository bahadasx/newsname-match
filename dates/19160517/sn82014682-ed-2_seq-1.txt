WILL INVESTIGATE
HAWAII RESOURCES
Itl EVENT OF WAR
Local Members of American
Society of Civil Engineers
Asked to Act
PART OF NATION-WIDE
"INDUSTRIAL INVENTORY"
Information to Be Confidential
and Turned Over to War
and Navy Departments
Hawaii's industrial resources as :
f they would be available In war-time
are to be investigated and 'mobilized
on paper" within the next few months
by local business and professional
' men. " -
Members here of the American -So-.
clety of Civil Engineers have receiv
ed from the New York headquarters
of the society a letter sent through-
out the United States informing them
of an early industrial inventory" of
Uncle Sam'a manufacturing and pro
ducing resources. As one Important
aection of the United 8tates, Hawaii
la Included in this natjon-wlde inves-
.' tlgatlon.
The Information to be collected will
be confidential and will be turned
over to the war and navy departments
for their use, aa the letter says, "in
formulating plans through which ev
ery resource of this nation may, in
time of emergency, be enlisted quick
ly in government service.
The letter received by local mem
bers of this big engineering society
is signed by Elmer L. Corthell, presi
dent, and Charles Warren Hunt, secre
tary. It saya that within the next 30
days the society is to begin this indus
trial Inventory "at the direct request
of the president of the United States."
Besides the American Society of Civil
- Engineers, there are cooperating the
' American Institute of Mining Engi
neers, the American Society of Mech
anical Engineers, the American Insti
tute of Electrical Engineers and the
American Chemical Society. "
inntmctlons and inventory " forms
Mil reach the local investigators
through the malls. '--
European War's Lessons,
' The letter says in part: .
"Nearly two years of the European
struggle has taught us that we must
revise our entire previous conception
' of war. A failure on the part of for
elgn countries to perfect plana calmly
and efficiently in time of peace has
led to such economic confusion and to
auch fatal delay in industrial mobiliza
tion that the costs both in. lives and
money may be counted only by the
millions. We have learned that or
ganized industry is the bed-rock upon
which we must build our defensive
, structure."
In Hawaii, it Is pointed out by
those familiar with the situation, some
of the iines of investigation might be
about as follows:
Possibilities for utilizing local iron
works, machine-shops and ship-buHd-lng
plants In time of war. ...
Plans for turning motor-cars and
trucks over to military authorities in
emergencies. . '
Use of fertilizer plants for manu
facture of chemicals used in muni
tions and possibilities for securing
services of skilled plantation and ex
periment station chemists. .
Problem of food supplies here.'what
can be stored and what raised, both
for human population and for - ani
'. mals. . " ' '
These are only .a few of the many
factors under the head of "manufac
' turing and producing resources' which
the engineers are asked to investi
gate. ' .
How the investigation will be under
taken is still a question. It is expect
ed that the written instructions will
come ver 'shortly. One conjecture
was made this morning that the Ha
waiian Engineering Association might
be asked to cooperate. '
