BRITONS WHO REFUSE
WAR SERVICE IMPRISONED j
London, Eng., May 17. A score of '
"conscientious objectors" to military
service, whose objections had been over
ruled by the military tribunals, were
sent Tuesday to various prisons to un
dergo punishment after courtmartitl
for refusal to obey orders.
Several were sentenced to two years
at hard labor. Some of them had re
fused to put on khaki or shave and all
refused to drill.
Several speakers in parliament, in
the course of the discussion of the
military bill, expressed the opinion
that scruples of genuine conscientious
objectors often fall to receive proper
consideration by those empowered to
pass upon these cases. But thus far.
the only concessions which they have
been able to obtain from the govern
ment is that none of them will have
the deatli penalty imposed by the court
martial for refusing to obey military
orders.
GERMAN GRENAbTATTACK

at Hauclremont wood and Vaux pond.
French airplanes made several raids
during the night. Bombs were thrown
on the German camp at Damvillers and
on the railway stations at Metz, Fres

Effort to Keep Texas Gov
ernor Out of the Na
tional Convention.
San Antonio, Tex.. May 17. Itobert
Harper Kirby, president of the Anti
Saloon league of Texas, lias issued the
following statement:
"The coming state Democratic con
vention in San Antpnio will be con
troled, more than two-thirds, by the
prohibitionists. Tabulation of retur.is
from the county conventions, to date,
give the prohibitionists SSO of he
SSO votes of delegates to the conven
tion. The prohibition vote is gaining
and we expect to have more than 600
otes In the convention."
Fro Fight Ferguson.
An analysis by W. D. Harnady, a well
known Texas political writer, of the
proceedings of the different county
conventions held for the purpose of
selecting delegates to the state con
vention to elect delegates to the na
tional convention and to make the
choice for national committeeman leads
him to the conclusion that there will
be a warm contest, largely along pro
hibition and anti-prohibition lines. In
San Antonio. The convention will meet
on May 21 and will probably hold for
two days.
In reviewing the action of the pre
cinct and county conventions it is also
pretty well appaient that the prohibi
tion organisation, through its superin
tendent. Dr. A. J. Barton, of Waco,
made a strong fight with the view of
obtaining control of the state conven
! tion. It would seem that there are two
I purposes in seeking to do this. Ona Is

It is conceded In well informed Demo

and his aides may succeed in making

made anv fight to obtain the Instruc
tions of the county delegations. Mr

tional committeeman. Cato Sells. United
States commissioner of Indian affairs,
the prohibi-
ftorts to con
st San An
tonio, the proceedings of that body
would perhaps have been marked by
more harmony than has characterized
a state Democratic gathering for many
years. It was the original purpose of
the leading Democrats of the state. Ir
respective of their attitude on the pro
hibition question, to get together on
that occasion and elect a Wilson dele
gation to the national convention with
out regard to the views of its member;
to state wide prohibition. It Is of
course assured that the delegation will
be In instructed for Wilson and that the
national administration will receive the
hearty endorsement of the convention,
but it is equallv as certain, if recent de
velopments are to be relied upon, that
the state convention will not be that
harmonious affair that was promised
a few weeks aso.
Dr. Barton has intimated that he is
strongly opposed to Gov. Ferguson be
ing sent to the national convention as
a delegate at large, and If he is voicing:
the sentiment of the prohibition fac
tion in the matter, there will be a con
test when his name is proposed. It 's
known, however, that many of the mor
liberal minded men of that element are
in favor of the governor being honored.
For this reason, it is more than a good
guess that he will head the delegation.
WORK ON NEW P0ST0FFICE
TO BEGIN IN 60 DAYS
Work on the new posloffice at the
corner of Mills and Stanton streets, will
lie started in about 60 days, according
to assistant postmaster M. L. Burleson,
Wednesday. The structure will cover
a block, and will have two entrances,
the main entrance facing on. Mills
street, with the "side entrance on Stan
ton street.
Three hundred thousand dollars will
be spent on the building, but the ma
terial to be used or the height has not
yet been specified. The postoffice de
partment, after receiving the post
master's estimate of the space he would
need, turned over the specifications to
the architects who are now drawing up
the plans. i
The department has let the contract I
to II. C. Semple for test pits to dete'-
mine what material will be used In the I
foundation.
The increase in business of the post-
iifflce. has necessitated much larger
office space than in the present build- j
tng. Assistant postmaster Burleson es- I
timated the monthly increase at over J
$30,000, comparing last year with this. I
He says the increase yearly has been I
over la percent. '

PENROSE WINS
PEIiLECTl
Defeats Gov. Brumbaugh
for Republican Leadership
After a Bitter Fight.
Philadelphia. Pa., May 17. Interest
in the first presidential preferential
primary election in Pennsylvania Tues
day was overshadowed by the contest
for the leadership of the Republican
party in the state, in which United
States senator Boles Penrose apparent
ly was victorious over Gov. Brumbaugh
after one of the bitterest fights In the
history of the organization. The fight
centered on the office of auditor-general
and the returns today indicated
the nomination of state senator Chas.
A. Snyder, representative of the Pen
rose element, over Charles A. Amb
ler, standard bearer of the Brumbaugh
forces, by a comfortable margin.
In the fight for the election of 12
delegates at large to the Republican
national convention the Penrose fac
tion apparently elected the majority of
its candidates. The Brumbaugh ele
ment, however, claimed the election
of the governor and mayor Smith of
Philadelphia. The Brumbaugh candi
dates are pledged to support the pop
ular choice of the party in the state
while the Penrose delegates are unin
structed. There were only two candidates on
the presidential preferential ballots,
president Wilson on the Democratic
and Gov. Brumbaugh on the Republi
can, but Henry Ford received a large
number of votes bv use of stickers, a
million of which haa been distributed
bv his business agents. Former presi

SAN ANTONIO. Texas, May 17. The
rescue by American soldiers of
Jesse Deemer and the negro cook,
Monroe Payne, carried off as prisoner.,
by the bandits that raided Glen Springs
and Boquillas. Texas, was reported
to MaJ. Gen. Funston today.
The rescue alive was due. It Is said,
to the refusal of the residents of the
village where they had been left, to
carry out the orders of the bandits to
kill the'eaptives if the American troops
attempted their rescue.
The report came from Col. Frederick
Sibley who received his information
from Maj. Langhorne. now about 100
miles south of the border. A detach
ment of MaJ. Langhorne's force found
the Americans at El Pino, 90 mile,
south of Boquillas, Tuesday morning.
The Americans had been left there by
their captors in charge of the resi
dents. None by the unarmed inhabi
tants of the town was there when the
American soldiers arrived and no re
sistance was made
Maj. Langhorne reported to Col. Sib
ley that he was pushing forward and
hoped to overtake the bandits during
the day. He added that no federal
troops had been encountered and that
the attitude of the residents in the ter
ritory through which he had passed ap
peared friendly.
A scarcity of forage was reported
and Col. Sibley said he was preparing
To send forward as rapidly as possible
hay and grain for the horses and mules.
