MEXICO'S SUSPICIONS

nr 1 ' . ! f A :
misunaersianaing or Ameri
ca's Mission Is Turned Into
Active Cooperation by the
' Frank Friendliness of Scott.
(By Review Leased Wire.) ,
WASHINGTON, May 16. An .
optimistic view of the Mexican
situation was laid before Presi
dent Wilson and hfs cabinet today
by Secretary Eaker, after a long
conference with Major General
Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff. Gen
eral Carranza and his advisers
now understand the motives of
the Washington government more
fully than ever before, as a result
of the conference at El Paso be
tween Generals Scott and Funs
ton and General Obregon, Mr.
Halter was able to tell the cabinet
and tension along the internation
al line has been greatly relieved.
General Scott believes that the
whole situation is less acute than
it ha?, been at any time since the
raid on Columbus, N. M.
General Obregon, it is learned, en
tered the conference with much ap
prehension as to the real purpose of
General Pershing's swift march deep
into Mexico in pursuit of Villa and his
rn-ders. In Mexico, he said it seemed
. . . r . j . ; . t
vst could not be moving merely in
pursuit of the bandit chieftain and his
handf'.fl of followers. Undoubtedly
Obregon reflected rears relt in Mexico'
. . i
City that the expeflition was in reaiuy
p steo toward intervention by tne
United States.
The American conferees were able
to convince the Mexican war minister
rrd throntrh him. General Carranza,
that President .Wilson's announce
ment of the purpose of the expedition
told the whole storv; that its mission
was onlv as described to pursue or
capture the bandits and return across
the line. The striking accomplish
ment of Generals Scott and Funston
lay in the fact that they succeeded in
doing this without making any pledg
. ,
as to when American troops woum
recalled.
Carranza Promises
The chnnee in General Obregon's
views was clearly indicated by prom
ises he made at the conclusion of the
conference, promises approved by
General C?rran7.a and which he is
now carrying out with promptitude
nrd vigor, according to official reports
f'om army officers and consular offi
cials in Mexico. It is these pledges
... l,;nli ara InlAFT.MtilJ OC f n fTTl j Tl fr an !
unwritten agreement. They include
the following:
Here Are Pledget
That 10.000 picked troops under
General Trevino. the ablest of the
Carranza field commanders, occupy
and police the territory around Par
ral. the southern limit of General
Pershing's drive and in other districts
where there are no American troops.
Thpt an effective patrol be thrown
about (he Mexican side of the Big
fiend region of the Texas border to
hepd off the Glenn Springs and Bo
quil'as raiders: that every effort be
n.ade to liberate Deemer. the Ameri
can storekeeper captured and carried
away by the bandits, and:
Keep Sonora Troops Away
That no troops will be moved from
the forces in Sonora slate through
Pulpit Pass to operate in the rear of
General Pershing's forces.
Avoid Clashes
While General Scott, for his part,
made no promises as to withdrawal
and very clearly stated to General
Ohregon that I'nited States troops
would stay in Mexico until Carranza
forces had fully demonstrated their
ability to handle the bandit situation,
assurances were given that American
troops would not operate in parts
where the Carranza forces were act
ive. This will be done to avoid the
possibility of clashes, and for the
same reason no attemnt to cooperate
in troop movements will be made un
less it be by arrangement of the local
commanders, American and Mexican.
Orders Carried Out
General Scott said today that recent
reports of Carranza troop movements
in the region south of General Persh
ing in his opinion showed that Gener
al Obreenn's orders were being car
ried out proupMy. While the move
ments had been given sinister signi

MARATHON, Tex., May 1G.
Colonel Sibley and troops of
the Fourteenth Cavalry bring
ing up the rear of the second
punitive expedition have taught
up with Major Langhorne,
whose two troop of the Eight
cavalry were leading the way
into Mexico, and have halted,
according to information sent
here last night.
The expeditionary column
has traveled eighty miles Into
the interior in its object of res
cuing from Mexican bandits
the American ranchmen Jesse
Deemer, John Woodson, F.
Ballsworth and Monroe Payne.
Nothing has been heard from
these men since the bandits
took them into Mexico.
A rumor was current yester
day that Major Langhorne's
troops engaged in a brush with
bandits and that one American
trooper was wounded, but the
report lacks confirmation.
