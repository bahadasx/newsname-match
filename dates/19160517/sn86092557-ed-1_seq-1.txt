County Road Engineer Wil
fong and His Men Have
Been Busy.
SOME PLACES WERE BAD
Prisoners Have Finished
Work on the District
Roads.
Practically all of the dirt roads In
the county are now open aud passable
for all manner of vehicles, according
to the report of County Road Engineer
ong. With picks and shovels and
road scrappers and wagon loads of
rock, a force of men has been busy
for the past few weeks leveling and
smoothing off the surface and open
ing the ditches of the various main
turnpikes leading to and from Fair
mont. Most of the worst mudholea
have been filled with stone and dirt,
and with the ditches opened it will
now take considerable rain to agaiu
make the roads too muddy for auto
mobiles.
The stot? wall at the slip near the
Bell farm on the Pine Grove paved
road has been completed and this
road is in fair .shape as is also the
West Fork river road on the hill be
low the farm of Will McCray. This
place was dangerous because of the
dirt slipping out from beneath the
pavement Although the pavement
had not cracked as it did on the Pine
Grove road, yet it was dangerous to
pass this place as a fall was feared
at any time. The completion of a
wall at this place by the county en*
gineer will probably be all that is
neede to prevent any further occur
rence of this kind.
The prisoners from the county Jail
that have been at work on the dirt
roads are no longer necessary on these
and are now again at work repairing
the blrm along the pavements in the
improved road districts. This blrm
will be graveled and made solid so
that vehicles in passing may drive
out upon it without danger of fall
ing into a soft hole or becoming mfr
ed in -the eoft mud.
The work of macadamizing the un
finished section of the Ice's Run and
Pine Grove road specified in the Fair
mond district bond issue is being rap
idly completed by the contractor as
is also the portion that is to be pav
ed from the top of the hill near the
McBee residence into Eighth street
and Locust avenue.
The old dirt roadB leading from this
city to Morgantown and those toward
Fairview and Clarksburg are reported
to be In fair shape with the excep
tion of a few chuck holes that are
rapidly being repaired.
STOPS DIVORCE
Many Matters Passrd Upon
By Judge Vincent
Today.
Max Boar who was sued by Sam
Cornoll "lor rent of a storeroom at Mo
nongah will have to pay the $35 as the
jury that heard the appealed case in
Intermediate court returned a verdict
of this sum for the plaintiff. The ap
peal of the second case of Sam Cornell
against Max Bear was begun this after
noon before Judge Vincent and another
Jury.
No jury was used during the morn
ing session but a number of chancery
and law cases were heard and several
orders issued. Chief of these was the
judgment entered for the plaintiff in
the case of Monongahela Valley Trac
tion Company againBt the Fairmont
Packing Company. ThlB action was
brought to recover an unpaid gas bill
amounting to $1,435.5. Attorneys Mor
ris and* Alexander represented the
plaintiff and the defendant failing to
appear judgment was ordered for the
full amount.
The divorce proceedings in chancery
of Nellie Bell against Frank Bell, were
ordered dismissed from the docket, At
torney M. L. Sturm who represented
the plaintiff saying that the parties had
become reconciled, and no longer de
sired a divorce.
An injunction restraining further
proceedings at law was granted the
defendant in the case of John Samarco
against Umberto Scalise. Application
for this injunction was filed several
days ago by Scalise.
An order dismissing the appeal waB
entered in the case of Wilfong against
Linn.
Judge Vincent announced this morn
ing that the docket requiring jury
trials would likely be finished in an
other day or so although the present
session of court would continue for
some time.
The case of Wilson against Wilson'
which Is a will contest with several
heirs on either side will probably be
the most important of cases yet to be
heard before a jury. Attorneys Shaw
and McCray represent the defendants
with M. L. Sturm and J. A. Meredith

their annual convention at Wheeling
this week, a cordial invitation to hold
the next annual meeting in this city.

present limited hotel capacities that
this icty has been unable to obtain

from an artistic and financial stand
point. The society was launched early
in January with some trepidation upon
the part of the promoters. While being I
fully convinced that Fairmont needed
a Choral society, yet they were not i
sure that Fairmont knew that she j
needed such an organization. Howev

the first concert of the society put all

Plans for future entertainments are
under discussion and its is an assured
fact that the society will bring an ar

Milk Supply.
"The funeral expenses ot two babies
would easilv nay for the (ull enforce'1
ment of Fairmont's model Milk Ordin
ance." This Is it statement made by'
a prominent physician ot Fairmont!!!
when asked as 10 his views on the'
milk problem.
Opinions on the subject were salted]
from a large number ot local pbjtffc
lans anil each stated that he was "em- L;
phatically in favor of a strict and poil- j
live prutical Inspection ot tie m^S
supply of the city, especially durlnc":
the summer months when so many dis
eases of children are caused by Impure
sources of milk supply.
"Practically all dangerous intg&tlnal'
and stomach disorders such is chol
era, infantum, colic, diarrhoea, dyiaut
ery and kindred dlsordera art direct
ly caused by the use or milk (Sat con-'
tains too great a numberofMlo vari
ous bacteria that are responsible for
these Infections," said one pliyilelan,
"and by a rigid Inspection otfth* milk
sold In the city, as provided undo '?
our milk ordinance, the prevalence ol
these diseases could be reduced to the
minimum. If the people ot Fairmont
thoroughly understood what a valu
able instrument this Milk Ordinance
would be If enforced, thw would de
mand the city officiate to begin the
"The present Board ot Health OHM
city could easily do the additional '
work of enforcing the milk ordinance
and make all tests and Inspection! ?;
with the additional expense ot about
$25 per month." This 1b the conserra-J
live estimate of the Board and would .
be the only expense connected .with i
work after the original outlay for,addi
tional apparatus and equipment'VrikS
made. For a practical and thorough ,
milk Inspection, as provided In the
ordinance, the apparatus needed tar
the bacteriological work that U nec
essary la comparatively Inexpensive, "
the city physician at presedt. iftvlng
most of the needed material already '
in his office.
The Milk Ordinance thatjlfflH
ered one of the beat In Westjjp
was passed nearly seven years ago by j
the council of Fairmont and fofvl*
in effect since May 1, 1909. Al(t
this law has been on tbe city ordli
book 6 yearB, yet no proyisgg
enforcement has ever been n
that time. The matter hasHjjmHhl
tated from time- to time but because
of the apposition of a few milk meti
who feared that the ordlnahc?33g2ii|
work a hardship on them, thB Board
of Affairs lias feared to enforced the
act.
Because of tho length of t%(p Ordin
ance and the full provisions of all de
tails of the Inspection and the regu
lation of the milk supply by/the Board
of Health, many of the milk men have
become confused after reading it and
fail to perceive the advantages and
benefits whjcli every honest Und care
ful dairyman will derive *trom Its en
forcement.
The plan of the Ordinance Is aim.
pie and practical and cannot
work any hardship on the milk men.
Instead it protects each honest milk1
man from the unscrupulou^and dan-!
erous practices of his less careful i
and unsanitary competltor.fjJThe Or
dinance simply provides thi
milk man shall make application and"
