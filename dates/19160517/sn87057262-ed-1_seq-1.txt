Asked today to estimate the length

Mexico, according to scouts returning

name of the one-armed general is on
the lips of every Mexican he is re
garded as the staunch supporter of
Mexican national integrity and his
popularity far exceeds that of General
Carranza among the rank and file of
natives.
.Obregon's attitude in the El Paso
conferences, regarded as entirely un
compromising, has served to heighten
his popularity.

MEXICO CITY, May 71.—War Wa

El Paso, declared his absolute confi

so reported to General Carranza.
Obregon said his conferences with
Generals Scott and Funston had been
highly satisfactory. He is satisfied,
he said, that both army officers favor
the withdrawal of the American troops
as soon as they are convinced the
danger of border raids has been elim
inated. For that reason he is send

co-operate with the American forces

Obregon was to have further con

His negotiations at the border were

Hardly had the American troops

The Chinese were shot and their

LONDON, May .17.—Twenty thou

Kut-EI-Amara, presumably to meet
the Russian advance on Bagdad, ac

today.
The Turks are recruiting all native

Prolongation of the Tigris flood has
made it possible for the Turks to
strip their lines around Kut-EI-Amara
without fear of an immediate British

In diplomatic circles here it is be

that the fight to prove his innocent

E. O. Orpet, senior, chief gardener
of the McCormick estate, told the
United Press today that he fears
he has already impoverished himself
to pay for counsel to defend the
youth, but that he will toil from
morning until night to earn money to
carry the case to the highest courts
if Orpet is found guilty.
"The trial has cost us a lot of
money already," the elder Orpet said.
"And it will cost a lot more. Why we
haven't even started to compute the
cost of hiring attorneys. It will take
our last cent, I'm afraid."
With Mrs. Orpet, the father talked
over prospects of gaining freedom
for their son. They are confident of
his acquittal, but are taking every
precaution to pave the way for an
appeal.
The first two panels of talesmen
summoned for service in the Orpet

day with only four tentative jurors

TESTIMONY WHS ALL ONE SIDED
As Member of the Nobility, Casement May
Choose His Own Rope in Case He is
Sentenced to Hang.
[By Wilbur S. Forrest, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
LONDON, May 17.—Maps found In
th© possession of Sir Roger Casement
support the contention that the plans
for the Irish rebellion originated In
the German war office, Lieutenant
Colonel Gordon, of the British war
office Intelligence department testi
fied today.
A large crowd surrounded Bow
street police court when the prelim'
nary hearing of Sir Roger and Daniel
Bailey, on charges of high treason,
was resumed today, though the crown
planned to call but few witnesses.
Oasement, more calm than on the pre
ceding days of the trial, listened in
tently while the British Intelligence
officer testified.
Gordon said he had examined maps
!of Ireland carried by Casement when
[lie landed from a German submarine
and that none of them was printed In
Great Britain. They gave certain de
tails to landscape that showed they
had been made under the direction of
the German war office, and thus sup
ported the belief that the German gov"
ernment played an important part in
the scheme for the rebellion.
Second Lieutenant Brierly of the
war office, testified to the previous
good record of Bailey, Casement's
confederate, while serving in an Irish
regiment.
Constable Carter, cross-examined
by counsel for Daniel Bailey, said
that when Bailey was arrested he de
clared he had important Information
to give the police. The purpose of
his testimony was to show that Bailey
knew nothing of Casement's plans to
lead a rebellion until he reached the
Irish coast and was willing to aid the
government as soon as he had an op
portunity.
Sergeant Bustwick, of the Irish
constabulary, testified that Bailey,
after his arrest, informed the officers
at the barracks of the plans to land
an expedition from the German aux
iliary Aud.
Bustwick said that Bailey, before
giving him news of the expedition,

Britten followed Bustwick in the

Committed for Trial.
[By Wilbur S. Forrest, United Press
Staff Correspondent]
LONDON, May 17.—Sir Roger Case
ment and Daniel Bailey Were commit
ted for trial on charges of high trea
son by Sir John Dickinson, presiding
magistrate, at the conclusion of the
preliminary hearing this afternoon.
Both Sir Roger and his soldier con
federate will now go on trial for their
lives in the high court of justice. If
convicted, they probably will be sen
tenced to death, Casement being given
the privilege accorded his rank of
being hanged with a silken cord.
The magistrate's decision was an
nounced after the crown, at a brief
session today, had completed the
frame work of its case against the
two accused men. Counsel for Case
ment and Bailey, during the three
days of the preliminary hearing, con
tented themselves chiefly with cross
examining witnesses for the crown,
reserving their actual defense for the
trial later.
'I he nature of Casement's defense
is still a mystery. Counsel for Bailey
will attempt to show that the former
Irish soldier knew nothing of the
character of the undertaking upon
which he embarked on a German
boat and speedily informed British
authorities of the plan to foment a
rebellion when he landed on the Irish
coast.
Keynote of Address.
CEDAR RiAPrDS, Iowa, May 17.—
Howard J. Clark, temporary chair
man, of the republican state conven
tion, here today took "Americanism"
as the keynote of his address and
boosted Senator A. B. Cummins as
the most available, best fitted and
typical candidate for the republican
nomination for the presidency. Thous
ands of visitors and delegates are
here today, part of them to give the
•Cummins boom an official send-off,
the rest to attend the circus.
•Clark spoke of Cummins' seven,
year fight for the presidential pref
erence primary in Iowa and said it
was fitting that he should 'be the
man to lead the movement for popu
lar self government at this time.
Clark said the great central west has
taken an active part in developing
the principles of republicanism in the
past and will continue to uphold the
ideals of the people.
The foreign policy of the Wilson
administration was severely criticiz
ed. especially in regard to Mexico.
Clark said:
"One of the fundamental principles
of government and especially of a
democracy, is that it should not in
terfere with the internal affairs of
another nation. With this in mind,
what answer can the present admin
istration give to its conduct in Mex
ican affairs? If it be conceded that
Mexieo has a government at all, then
the policy of the administration is
the worst violation of the principles
announced known in history. On the
o£her hand, if no government existed
at all in Mexico, our conduct is
shameful and should have no defense
for we have permitted our own peo-
