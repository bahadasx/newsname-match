Hearing Ends After
Brief Hearing Today
NATURE OF DEFENCE UNKNOWN
Counsel May Attempt to Prove Ser
geant Bailey Was Ignorant of Real
Nature of Expedition.
London, May 17. The Arises of Sir
Roger Casement and of Daniel J.
Bailey, the Irish sergeant,' charged
with treason, will now go to the high
court. If convicted they will probab
ly be executed. The presiding magis
trate at the Bow-street court, where
the preliminary hearings have been
held, made this announcement after a
brief session this forenoon.
What the nature of the defence to be
presented by Casement's attorneys
"will be continues a mystery. Counsel
for Bailey will probably endeavor to
show that the sergeant had little
knowledge of the alleged plotes of
Casement and they will endeavor to
prove that the soldier disclosed the
presence of the expedition on the Irish
coast to the British authorities as soon
as he became aware of its purpose.
London, May 17. Sir Roger Case
ment and Daniel J. Bailey, who for two
days past have been undergoing a pre
liminary examination in the Bow
street police court in London oh the
charge of high treason iu connection
with the recent Irish revolt, will proba
bly know today whether they will be
placed on trial for their lives in a high
er court. The attorneys for the crown
virtually concluded the introduction of
evidence yesterday and unless the de
fense has some surprise in store it is
believed the hearing will be concluded
and the magistrate'? -ieclsion whether
the prisoners shall.be held for trial
will be given today.
Legal experts who are following the
case expressed last night the opinion
that there was small doubt that Sir
Roger and Bailey would reserve their
defense for the higher court.
After the hearing had been in
progress for somo time, Casement
turned his attention, from the testi
mony to the writing of a long state
ment. It was while thus engaged
that he showed marked emotion for
the first time since the hearing began
Whatever was the nature of his
thoughts they were such that they
moved to tears. He wept quietly as
he worked away with his pencil. It
was a striking change from the smil
ing and self-confident man of a short
time before.

THE TICHENOR PLACE
Famous Old Place Passes

Into New
Thf fjj Governor Isaac Tichenor
honiestt.. Mount Anthony road in
Old Benniiib s been sold. The
purchasers are . Mrs. Philip 15.
Jennings who own u- - ee further
along on the same high., and wished
to control the property adjacent to
their own grounds. Kdward H.
Houghton of Kaston, N. Y., administra
tor of the Catherine Lyman estate
since the death of Mrs. Phoebe Ann
Lyman about ten years ago, sold the
property and the papers were passed
Monday through the office of William
J. Meagher.
Probably no house in Bennington
village or Old Beunington had quite
the history of this old estate which
dates back to the Revolution. Isaac
Tiehenor, its builder, came to Ben
nington on August 14th, 1777, from
NTew Jersey. At that time he was
deputy commissioner of purchases for
the northern department of the Col
onial army. He was a Princeton man
and after the successful outcome of
the revolution, determined to stay
here. He built a small house on the
same site as the present structure and
in 17i7 was elected governor of the
state.
This office he held 11 years succes
sively, after which he was elected
United States senator from Vermont
and also became a chief justice. He
was one of the most cultivated and
polished men of his day and a gentle
man of the old school. Up to the time
of his death he still wore the wig,
queue, cocked-hat and great cloak of
the revolutionary period. He died in
18-10.
It appears that his home as it stands
today was built by the governor about
years after he settled . here, the
original structure being moved back on
the lot w here it may still be seen. The
present house was built early in the
19th century and was under the direct
supervision of the owner, there being
no such things as professional con
tractors in those days. It was con
structed throughout of seasoned lum
ber, solidly put together and the nails
which were used are said to have been
cut from the hoops of old wine kegs.
In its day It was one of the most
stately furnished places on the hill
and during the governor's life many
famous people were entertained within
Its spacious rooms. For many years
after its builder's death his portrait
hung in the house. The hall of the
second floor was papered with wall
paper struck off at the time- of Well
ington's death in commemoration of
the same. In the same hall was kept
handsome silk and silver banner
decorated on both sides and ornament
ed with silk fringe and tassels, pre
sented to Gov. Tichenor by the Wash
ington society of which he was a
member, in recognition of his services
to the state and nation. Another In
teresting relic that the old bouse con
tained in its day was a Washington
pitcher, manufactured In France and
containing the medallion of the great
commander-in-chief on Its sides: Most
of these heirlooms were distributed
among the heirs when the place was
dismantled a few years ago.
Upon the governor's death the house
went to his neice, Miss Catherine Tich
enor who afterward married George
Lyman, a highly esteemed resident of
Old Hennington and for years a deacon
in the Old First church. Although
Gov. Isnac Tichenor married, he had
no children.
Deacon Lyman married twice, his
second wife being Miss Phoebe Ann
Beach, a native of New Jersey and an
aunt of Rev. David N. Heach, D. D.
president of the Bangor Theological
Seminary, who is now living. She
was also the aunt of Rev. Harlan
Beach who Is at present professor of
Chinese languages iu Yale
A daughter of Deacon Lyman's first
marriage, Miss Mary Lyman, married
Col. George D. Harrington, at ono time
of the firm of Grovcr &. Harrington,
many years Iron merchants on North
street where the Putnam factory now
stands. Another daughter. Miss Cath
erine Lyman married Ezra W. nought-
en, for many years a leading whole
sale hatter und furrier of Troy. A
third daughter, Elizabeth, married Col.
Theodore Lyman, prominent years ago
in the Jewelry business in Montreal.
One son, Jones Lyman, a graduate of
Williams College, became n physician,
and went to Ios Angeles
The house was last occupied by E,
Palmer noughton, a grandson of dea
con Lyman. Mrs. Phoebe Ann Lyman
lived in the place previous to her
death several years ago. The bouse
was last opened at the time of the Ben
nlngton Pageant.
For many years thero was connect
ed with part of the Tichenor property
the farmland lying north of the high
way going to the Colgate place; ex
tending from what was known as the
Pcwev-Iluhbcll farm and known ns the
Cross-road. This laud Is now owned
by .Mr. and Mrs. Philip H. Jennings.

CLOTHES AND A SWIMMER.
A Word About Going Overboard at Sea
While Fully Dressed.
Professor J. July sent to the London
Times a letter on experiments he and
Professor II. If. Dixon have conducted
on tne advantages and disadvantages
of swimming in clothes n subject
which may be of importance to any
one who travels iy sea.
The popular notion is that clothes
drag a swimmer down, but the maxi
mum downward drag of an ordinary
sailor's clothes In sea water was shown
to be only four ounces. This was after
all air had been expelled' from the
clothes. In practice the drag for a
considerable time would be less. At
first there would even be a -istalnlng
force from the clothes. Of course, for
n short and sharp burst of swimming
clothes would obviously be a great Im
pediment.
The most Important result of the ex
periments, however, was to show that
a clothed person In the sen loses
warmth very much less rapidly than
nn unclothed person. The explanation
Is that fabrics placed nunlnst the skin
stop the circulation and prevent tne
body warmth from being carried off
by the water. With a great amount of
clothing it. might be jwisslble to keep
fairly warm even -In very cold water.
The moral Is: Keep on your clothes.
and if yon have a life belt or life snv
Ing waistcoat keep on plenty of them.
PLAYING AT DEATH.
A Story of the Mother of Turgonev, the
Rutiian Novelist.
The mother of Ivan Turgenov, the
Russian novelist, was a trying person
to live with, Irritable, capricious and
unreasonable. On the anniversary of

of festivities, Mine. Turgenev pretend
ed to be dying.
"She sent for her confessor and, plac
ing before her the portrait of her son
Ivan, exclaimed: 'Adieu, Ivan! Adieu
Nicolas! Adieu, my children'.' Then
she ordered her forty servants and nil
the men employed about the house to
say Koodbv to her. When they had
filed out of the room Mme. '1 urgency
declared that she felt better and nsluv
for ten. The next day the followln
'order appeared:
" 'I give orders that tomorrow morn
Ing; the disobedient servants, Nicolas
Jneovlef. Ivan Petrof and I'gor Kon
drntatlef, shall sweep the court In front
of my windows.'
"Those f unics were those of servant
who had not appeared at her bedside
possibly because (hey were a little
drunk that evening, 'Good for not li
Ings! Drunkands!' exclaimed Mme
TurRencv. 'They rejoice nt the death
of their mistress!' "

Success in All Lines of Church

delivered this afternoon before the
Vermont Congregational conference
which is holding Its 121st annual meet
ing with the local church, by Hon.
Horace F. Graham of Craftsbury, the
present state auditor.
The morning session was largely
given up to tho itSth annual meeting
of the Vermont Domestic Missionary
society, the directors report being read
by Rev. C. H. Merrill, the secretary of
the society. The secretary reported
receipts for the year of $10,308.39, with
expenses of $8,023.70. Legacies and
incomes from friends invested amount
ed to J7.771.34.
This society employs students and
laymen as missionaries in weaker
churches and last year 40 missionaries
were at work under its direction in 42
fields in rural Vermont. The addit
ions to these mission churches dining
the year were 110 by confession and 43
by letter, a total of 153. The net gain
to these churches was 82 which Is the
largest gain in 10 years. The society
voted to appoint a committee to confer
with a similar committee from the
Raptlst and Methodist churches look
ing toward the 'employment of an
evengelist to labor among rural
churches in the state, the financial
part of the work to be distributed
among the three denominations.
Interesting addresses were made
during the session upon various prob
lems of the rural field throughout the
state, by women workers, by those
laboring among foreigners and by pas
tors of weak country churches.
The meeting is a notable gathering
in many ways, the most important of
which being the historical fact that the
first Congregational church in Ver
mont was organized in Old Benning
ton in 1702, and this is the fourth
time of the gathering of the organiza
ion here. The first session was held
in Hennington in 1857 and of its mem
bers cnly one person survives, Rev. G.
VV. ltoardman of New Jersey. Of the
next session in 1875 only five men are
known to be living, one of whom Rev.
C. H Merrill of St. Johnsbury being
present today. The session last previ
ous to the present was held iu the 1st
church in 1895.
The central theme of the present
session is: "l he I linstlan Uliurcn
and People and the New Day." Hon
John E.1 Weeks of Middlebury Is the
iresidlng ollicer and Rev. W. C. Clark
of Darnel, seeietary and among other

First Primary Shows Decided Pre
ference of Republicans
LITTLE OPPOSITION TO WILSON
Available Returns Indicate Little Dif
ference of Sentiment Throughout
State.
Based upon returns from the more,
important towns of the stale and upon
coniplete figures from three counties,
the first presidential preference pri
mary In Vermont ba3 resulted in an
expression for diaries E. Hughes as
republican candidate for president.
That Roosevelt is by no means elim
inated as a factor in state politics is
shown by the substantial vote he re
ceived in the various towns.
Undoubtedly the supply of Hughes
stickers provided for a number of
towns had a great deal to do -with tho
strength which Hughes showed.
Weeks and Root received scatter
ing votes throughout the slate, most
owns listing their strength under
scattering," except in Rutland coun
ty where a vote of 55 was counted for
Root.
In many towns the Roosevelt vote
was divided, one-half being registered
on the icpublicau and one-half on the
progressive ballot.
Among the towns which showed
more Roosevelt votes than Hughes
otes were St. Albans, Springfield,
Swanton, Morrist&wn, Barton, Ludlow,
Newport, Windsor. Wallingford,
hrewsbury. Mount Holly and Middle-
town Springs.
So far as delegates to the state con
dition are reported, they are largely
for Hughes, although none of them, so
far as reported, were instructed to
support any special candidate. The
so-called "old guard" largely predom
inates in delegations so fat reported.
Springfield sent three Roosevelt dele-.
gates, one Root and one Weeks dele-'
gate. ' i -
Windsor delegates were instructed
to present the name of George O.
Gridley as delegate to the Chicago
onventlon. St. Johnsbury to support
Theodore N. Vail, Montpelicr to sup
port Hugh J. M. Jonc3 and Springfield
to support I-. 11. Babbitt. Few other
instructions were reported except sev
eral delegations in Rutland county be
ing instructed for Col E. R. Morse.
