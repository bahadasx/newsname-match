Convention.
BERLIN, May 17. by wireless
to Tuckerton.?According to the
Austro-Hnngarian note sent to
neutral powers regarding the
sinking of the Austrian steamer
Dubrovnik and other Austrian
vessels, including the hospital
ship Electra. by hostile submarines,
the Dubrovnik had nineteen
passengers on board, including
several women and children,
when she was torpedoed.
Three bodies of women were
recovered, and four members of
the crew and four passengers are
missing.
Sank Without Warning.
The Overseas News Agency today, in
a summary of the Austrian note, sets
forth the details regarding the sink
in* of-the Dubrovnik as follows:
"A dispatch from Vienna states .that
the Austro-Hungarian government has
delivered a note to the representatives
of neutral powers stating that on May
t. at 10:30 a.m. the Austro-Hungarian
passenger steamer Dubrovnik, was destroyed
in the Adriatic by two torpedoes
fired without warning by an enemy
submarine. The first torpedo hit
the starboard side, and the ship immediately
began sinking.

"All the person* oi > uoi.?u
the lifeboats. Then a second torpedo
truck the ship, crushing the starboard
lifeboat with those in it. It was possible
to rescue sixteen passengers in a
second boat. Two additional persons !
were picked up from the water and
some were rescued by boats from the
shore
** >n hoard the ship were nineteen passengers.
among whom were two clergyi
o.i and several women and children.
to this time three bodies of women
have been recovered. Four sailors and
four passengers are missing.
Denies It Was Transport.
"Steffani Agency on May 10 stated
that a French submarine torpedoed the
ljubrovnik. which was a transport and
carried ammunition. This statement is
a flat invention.
"The capacity of the Dubrovnik was 4S0
tone and she therefore was not able to
carry troops nor ammunition. Besides
this, the distance of the submerged submarine
from her was so great that it was
impossible for it to discern the class of
persons carried by the steamer.
"The Austro-Hungarian government
states that the firing of the second torpedo
against the sinking steamer and the
lifeboats which were afloat must be qualified
as 'intentional murder.' The AustroHungarian
government holds the Italian
government equally responsible with the
French government, since the French
submarine was operating with the Italian
forces."
Vienna Protests to Neutrals.
VIENNA. May 16. via Berlin to London,
May 17.?The foreign ministry
has delivered the following note to the
representatives of all the allied and
neutral states at the Austrian court:
"The foreign ministry was able on
March 22 to lodge with the representatives
of the allies and neutral powers
accredited to the Vienna court an enegetic
protest against the torpedoing j
of the hospital ship Electra by an !
enemy submarine. This, however, was '
In no wise the first case where an I
enemy submarine attacked peaceable
ships in Austrian waters.
"As early as February \2 a submarine !
fired a torpedo near Punta Planka,
without advance warning, at the :
steamer Daniel-Erno of the Hungar- I
Croatic line, which escaped destruction j
only by a clever maneuver. The steamer's
captain, according to his sworn !
statement, which is confirmed by nu- j
weroua witnesses, saw plainly the submarine's
periscope and the torpedo's j
w?k?r.
Saw Wake of Torpedo.
"On February 28 a submarine, whose
periscope was not even seen, fired. also
in the vicinity of Punta Planka, a torpedo
at the steamer Zagreb of thf?
aa*ne company The ship was able
only by a quick turn to dodge the torpedo.
whose wake was seen by numerous
persons aboard.
"April 5 a torpedo was fired by a submarine
again at the Daniel-Erno/ this I
time also without "warning. It exploded
on the nearby rocky coast.
"The Austro-Hurigarian government
has not hitherto published these events, j
which fortunately were attended with
no damage. It limited itself to giving
notice of the attempts of February 12 j
and February 28 on local steamships to j
the United States, which has repeatedly
made questions arising out of the submarine
warfare the subject of representations
to the central powers.
Termed "Lust for Destruction."
t "Xn.'view of this accumulation of at- ,
. v
1 tacks by enemy submarines on harm- i
less vessels, which are especially pro- I
| tected by The Hague convention, and I
in view of the circumstances that the
j enemy states are not?like the central
powers ? forced to defend themselves
against a nefarious plan to starve out
j whole nations, the destruction of a
peaceable ship, which cannot serve in
the war with our opponents in any
manner, can only be ascribed to blind
lust for destruction. This interprets- |
tion is now fully confirmed by the most ^
recent barbaric attempt on the Austrian
steamer Dubrovnik. This ship,
belonging to Xavigazione A Vapore Ragusea,
was destroyed May 9 in the Narenta
canal, between San Giorgone, Island
of Lesina, and (.'ape Gomena. on
the peninsula of Sabioncello (Adriatic
sea)."

Wholesome Respect for Americans. 5
NAMIQCIPA. f'hihuahua. May 17. via
wireless to Columbus. N. M.?American a,
residents of this section of Mexico have j
assured Oen. Pershing, commander of j e;
the punitive expedition, that the Ameri- c,
ran troops have restored respect on the ,
part of the natives for United States
soldiers to a degree not existing for
five years.
For some time Mexicans had sneered
at the fighting ability of the Americans,
some of them believing that the United
States soldiers were afraid to engage
any Mexican command. After the Ojo T
Azules fight, however, signs of the
growing respect on the part of the na- **
tives became more manifest. American r<
non-combatants living in the vicinity ^
were treated with a courtesy which astonished
them and the like of which Ci
they had not experienced for years.
These same Americans, however, have ?
openly expressed their intention of .
leaving Mexico if the expeditionary
command is withdrawn. They believe ^
that a native uprising will result inimediately
after the protection of the b:
American guns is removed. Numerous K
threats on the part of Villa and his 8'
lieutenants to punish persons dealing ?
with the Americans also have caused
some Mexicans and Chinese merchants a
to announce that they, too, will follow sl
the American command should it be
withdrawn.

ustice Siddons Takes a Hand in the
Examination of Witness at
Session Today.
Counsel for the Riggs National Bank
fficials on trial in Criminal Court No.
on a charge of perjury, seemed to score
?veral points when the case was resumed
:>day. Justice Siddons refused to al>w
the government to include as evlence
an unsigned order slip written
n Riggs Bank stationery, which purorted
to show, counsel for the governlent
said, that the bank dealt in
Locks, the claim of the bank officials
eing that the bank did not do so, as
tated in the affidavit to that exect
hich caused the perjury indictment of
ie officials.
After the luncheon recess, however,
jstice Siddons reversed his decision.
Edwin D. Flather, one of the employes
r the bank, was on the witness stand
t the time, and testified that the slip
as in his* handwriting. He was not
jestioned as to details, the slip not havig^reached
the point as evidence. Coun>1
for the bank objected strenuously to
s introduction, pointing out that the slip
>uld not be introduced because it was
M mentioned in the government's bill of
irticulars, and that it was nothing but a
lemorandum. without signature, which
id no more significance by reason of its
;ing on Riggs* stationery than it would
ave had it been on the stationery of a
Mel. The government contended in the
-gument that the slip furnished circumantial
evidence that the bank did deal
i stocks, but Justice Siddons upheld the
ink's counsel.
Judge Grants Permission.
After the luncheon recess attorneys
>r the government made another at;mpt
to get into the case as evidence
le unsigned memorandum in the handriting
of Edwin Flather. and Justice
iddons at the conclusion of the second
rgument gave permission for the in oduction
of the document.
One striking feature of this afternoon's
ission of the trial was the testimony of
dwin D. Flather to the effect that all
ders for the purchase and sale of stock
id bonds passed through his hands on
inted order slips addressed to "Charles
. Glover or William J. Flather." The tesmony
of Edwin D. Flather brought on
OSS examination. d??tailiner hnw <>9fh!
jrchase or sale of stock was made for a
jstomer of the bank, was looked upon
i the courtroom as having offset all the
yvernment's evidence offered with the
Dpe of proving that the bank dealt in
ocks and bonds for itself.
A dramatic moment occurred during
le trial this afternoon, when Attorney
iogan of counsel for the defense and
ttorney Fitts of counsel for the govrnmcnt
approached close to the verge
f a personal encounter. Mr. Hogan
lade the remark when he lost a ruling
y Justice Siddon8, "That will please
[r. Fitts." Mr. Fitts thereupon jumped
p and cried out, "You have got to
;ave my name out of this."
Mr. Hogan answered to the effect
lat he would please himself as to what
e might have to say. and Mr. Fitts
illed to him, "You will leave my name
Lit of Wiis case, I will make you do it."
There was a threatening attitude beveen
the two men for a moment,
hich might have resulted in contempt
f court, but they regained their comosure
just in time.
Of Benefit to Customers.
On a cross-examination of Edwin
lather. Mr. Hogan, of counsel for the
ank. brought out, for the benefit of
le jury, that various stoek transacons
with Lewis Johnson & Co. had
een for the personal and individual
eneflt of various customers of the
ank. This was in response to a long
irect examination of Mr. Flather by
ie government's counsel, during which
ie government proved the stock transctions.
Justice Siddons took a hand in the
xamination of the witness, to have him
mplify his statements as to the cirumstances
under which he placed orers
for the purchase and sale^of stock
t the request of the bank's customers,
nd at the request of Mr. Glover and
tie Messrs. Flather.
S. Taylor Burke Testifies.
The first witness this morning was S.
aylor Burke, for whom an officer of
ie bank bought some Pennsylvania
illroad stock, the bank loaning him
ie money and taking the stock as
bilateral. He testified to that fact.
Mr. Burke was followed by Edwin
>. Flather, exchange teller of the
ank, and the latter was asked to
lentify various entries in sheets from
idividual loose-leaf ledgers of the
ank, which were subpoenaed by the
overnment. Stock transactions were
tiown with Dr. B. L. Hardin, A. C.
labcock, Col. C. D. Baker, U. S. A.;
Irs. Mamie R. Harrison, G. B. Duncan
nd others. Justice Siddons had the
heets handed up to him and examined
tiem minutely.
Much of the morning session was
aken up with these routine identiflcaions
and the case dragged its weary
/ay along, to the apparent boredom of
he jury. Thue-appearance of the courtoom
was enlivened today by the preS,.^0
O ?
..? es*^^i' laoiiiuiiaoiy ciresseri
fomen, but not many visitors remained
uring the identification of the ledger
heets. Lawyers and bankers make up
lost of the audience at the trial.
Work After Court Hours.
Much work on the case is" being done
efore and after-court hours. The atorneys
for both sides were occupied
ist night in the courtroom until 7
'clock in arranging the great mass of
apers and books being placed in evience.
The jury went for a walk last
ight and they are to have other outage
and exercise.
Some speculation was indulged in toay
in the courtroom as to the probate
length of the trial, and, contrary
o first predictions that it would be a
ong-drawn-out affair of six weeks
r more, the prediction was made by a
member of counsel that the whole case
rould be in the hands of the jury by
he end of next Week.

U.S. CRUISER GRBDT
EIGHT MEN ARE MISSING
San Francisco Loses Whaleboat
Crew When She Hits Shoal in
Nantucket Sound.
BOSTON, May 17.?The United States
cruiser San Francisco, now serving as a
mine laying ship, was aground on a
shoal in Nantucket sound for several
hours early today in a gale, during
which it was reported she lost a whaleboat,
containing eight members of her .
crew. The San Francisco floated later I
without assistance and was not greatly ,
damaged. Observation from the uruisci- j
was imnossible because of the rain and
the fate of the eight men reported
missing could not be learned.
Advices regarding the whaleboat and
its crew were uncertain. Messages saying
they were lost were received at
two stations, while officers of the
Charlestown navy yard, which was in
touch with the cruiser most of the
time she was aground, said they had no
word that any men were missing.
Cruiser Was Fighting Gale.
The Ran Francisco, bound from this
port for Newport', R. I., was in command
of Commander Reginald R. Belknap.
She ran aground this morning
and brought up so hard on tf?e shoal
that her commander sent out a wireless
call for immediate assistance. The wind 1
was blowing a gale, he reported. <
The call was quickly answered. The
battleship New Hampshire replied she
would proceed "at the earliest moment
and at the highest practicable speed"
when conditions made it possible. The
coast guard cutters Acushnet and
Gresham proceeded at once and were on
their way to the stranded cruiser when
the message announcing she had been
floated reached shore.
In announcing that his vessel had been 1
freed Commander Belknap stated she was
in no danger.
The exact place where the San Francisco
stranded was in doubt. Commander
Belknap gave her position as latitude
41.22 north, longitude 69.46. This would
place the cruiser off the Old South Shoal,
while another message from the cruiser
said she had grounded on Great Round
Shoal, at the entrance of Nantucket
Sound.

LLOYD GEORGE AT WORK <
ON GOVERNMENT PROGRAM
Sir Edward Carson and John Red- ^
mond Co-Operating in Search
for Solution.
LONDON. May 17. 2:25 p.m.?The
Dublin correspondent of the Exchange
Telegraph Company says he understands
on good authority that Premier
Asquith is to be sworn in as a member
of the Irish privy council, becoming by
this act a.member of the Irish executive.
This is possibly the first step, the
correspondent adds, toward re-establishment
of civil administration in Ireland.
While Premier Asquith remains in a
Ireland seeking a solution of the Irish
problem, efforts are being made on this
side of the Irish sea to bring together
Sir Edward Carson, the Ulster leader,
and John Redmond, leader of the nationalists,
in the hope that a reconciliation
of the opposing factions may
be effected.
Working- for a Compromise.
As far as can be learned there have
been no negotiations thus far, but it is
considered a favorable sign that unionists
and home rule supporters are
working together and making suggestions
for a compromise.
The Manchester Guardian says that
David Lloyd George is about to take an
active part in the effort for a settle
ment. It is said he already has met Sir 1
Edward Carson and Joseph Devlin, Irish 1
nationalist member for Belfast, and <
that he has an engagement to meet Mr. i
Redmond. The Guardian adds that Mr. i
Lloyd George's scheme for a complete
settlement on home rule lines would
have powerful support in the unionist
press, and that this section of the
unionist press would not support any 1
bitter irreconcilability on the part of }
the Ulster unionists.
The unionist press of London, with
the exception of the Morning Post, <
which is strongly pro-Ulster, is urg- }
ing a settlement.
Premier Silent on Plans.
DUBLIN, May 17.?Premier Asqulth *

war was held at the Vice Regal Lodge t
last evening. t
The government's scheme of compen- 2
sation for property damage during the 1
recent outbreak is outlined in a state- I
ment by Sir Robert Chalmers, under- *
secretary for Ireland. 1
On Basis of Insurance. s
"In connection with the destruction
both in Dublin and elsewhere of buildings
and their contents," he said, "the k
state will* assume as a maximum the t
same liability as would have fallen on 1
insurance companies if the risk had a
been covered by ordinary fire insurance *
policies in force at the time of the r
recent disturbances.
"The lord lieutenant will appoint a f
committee to ascertain what sums are h
covered by the insurance policies in t
force and to advise what part of such c
sums would have been paid by the com- fc
parties if the destruction had been a
caused by accidental fire, and to advise
further how the claims of unin- c
sured persons can fairly be dealt with, e
Looting will be deemed similar to other f
acts of destruction. c
"In no case will any grant be made I
to persons in complicity with the out- i
break." t

Counsel in Trial /
for His Life.
STORY OF AUD'S SINKING 1
IS TOLD BY A WITNESS
Diver Who Examined Wreck Says
Rifles and Ammunition Covered
Bottom of Sea.
LONDON. Slay 17, 4:32 p.m.?Sir
toger Casement and Daniel J. Bailey
vere committed for trial today for
tigh treason.
This decision was reached at the conclusion
of the preliminary hearing of
hese men on the charge of participft*
ion in the Irish rebellion which has
>een in progress since Monday. The
late of the trial and the court before
vhich it will be held have not yet been
mnounced.
May Have American Counsel.
In response to a request from Casenent's
sister, made through the Ameri:an
embassy, the foreign office said tolay
the government would be glad to
consent to the appearance of Michael
Francis Doyle of Philadelphia as one
>f the attorneys for Casement.
An interesting feature of the testimony
vas the story of the fate of the German
(hip And, which' was sent out from Kiel
vith arms and ammunition to fulfill in
>art promises of assistance said to have
seen made by the Germans. The Aud
was held up on suspicion off the west
;oast of Ireland, not far from Tralee,
jy the British naval patrol ship BlueDell,
and was being taken to Queens:own,
when she was sunk by her own
:rew. Details of the capture and sinking
were given by Sidney Waghorn, ft
signal man on the Bluebell, who said:
AllH Plow Wnriraoion Plo?
? ? ? -O"*"
"Early Good Friday morning the
Bluebell was on patrol duty off the
southwest coast of Ireland when w*
sighted a ship flying the Norwegian
:olors. We signaled her and-asked who
ihe was and where she was bound. She
replied that she was the Aud, bound
from Bergen for Genoa. At that time
we were about 130 miles west of
Queenstown.
"We ordered the Aud to follow us.
but she did not do so until we fired a
shell. Then she proceeded with us.
"When we got near Daunt's Kock the
Vud stopped her engines. The Bluebell
was then a cable's length away from
aer and we saw white smoke coming
'rom her hold. Two German ensigns
vere run up on her masthead. The Aud
owered two boats which were rowed
oward the Bluebell. We fired around
hese boats. They flew flags of truce
tnd the occupants put up their hands,
rhey were made prisoners. They
moved to be nineteen or twenty Gernan
bluejackets with three officers.
Ten minutes later the Aud sank, about
i mile and a quarter from the lightihip."
Rifles Found by Diver.
Waghorn was followed on the stand
?y a diver who inspected the wreck of
he Aud for the purpose of confirming
he statement that she had arms and
ammunition aboard, it being claimed
hat she carried 20,000 rifles for the
ebels, besides other war material.
"The Aud lay in about eighteen
athoms of water," the diver said. "She
lad the Norwegian flag painted on her
lull. 1 found a hole in her side twelve I
>r fourteen feet in diameter. On/ the
>ed of the sea i saw a lot of rifles and
mmunition."
Constable Carter of the royal Irish
onstabulary was recalled for crossxamination
at the request of the de- n
ense. The trend of the questions indiated
that at the -time of his arrest *
Uailey attempted unsuccessfully to give
nformation to the police iti regard to
he projected uprising.
Carter was askedv whether he had
teard Bailey say, after his arrest, that
ie had a statement for the authorities
.nd that an officer should be sent for.
'he constable responded that he did not
lear this, but that at another time he
lid hear Bailey say: "I have important
nformation which will give you police
omething to do."
