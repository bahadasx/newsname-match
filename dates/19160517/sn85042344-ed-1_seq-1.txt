BORDER CRISIS

"Wilson and Cabinet Told
That Mexicans Are Cog

WASHINGTON. May 16. An op
timistic view of the Mexlcun
border Kitnation ivnn laid before Pres
ident Wilson and his cabinet today
by Secretary lluker iifler a Iuiik con
ference with Major General Scott,
chief of Htaff. General Carranzu and
his advisers now understand the mo
tives of the Washington government
more fully than ever before as a re
mit of the eonfereiire at Kl Puso be
tween Generals Scott, Fuuston and
Obrcgoii, Mr. linker was able to tell
the cabinet, and tension along the in
ternational line has greatly- relaxed.
General Scott believes that the
whole situation Is less anile than It
has been at any time since the raid
on Columbus, N. M.
Generil Obregoii, It Is learned, en
tered the conference with much ap
prehension as to the real purpose of
General Pershing's swift march deep
Into Mexico In pursuit of Villa and
his raiders.,' In Mexican eyes, he said,
it seemed ns though a great force
could not be moving merely in pirr
suil of ono bandit chieftain and his
handful of followers. Undoubtedly
ohrcgon reflected fears felt In Mexico
Citv that the expedition was in reali
ty a step toward Intervention by the
'Jiiited Sititcs.
Mission Friendly.
The American conferees were able
to convince the Mexican war minis
ter, and through him General Car
ranza, that President Wilson's an
nouncement of the purpose of the ex
pedition told the whole story; that Its
mission was only ns described, to dis
perse or capture the bandits and f0.
turn across the line. The striklns
accomplishment of Generals Scott and
Funston lay In the fact that thev
succeeded In doing this without
making any pledges as to when Amer
ican troops would be recalled.
The change in General ohrcgon'H
views wns clearly Indicated by prom
ises he made at the conclusion of the
conference, promises approved by
General Oarrunza and which he is
now carrying out with promptitude
and vigor, according to official re
ports from army officers unci consul
officials in Mexico.

It is Ihese pledge3 which are Inter

Speaking before a thousand or
more natural gas men who are here
to attend the annual convention of
the- Natural Gas association of the
United States. Dr. Van II. Manning,
director of the federal bureau of
mines at Washington, declared that
within a short time persons who al
lowed the fuel to go to waste would
be penalized. lie said that at the
present rate of consumption the sup
ply could lust no longer than 25
years.
"No natural resource hus been and
Is being so recklessly wasted as nat
ural gas," said Doctor Manning.
"Large quantities have been wasted
by being used Individually, but the
loss through such use has been unim
portant as compared to the large ab
solute waste that has occurred In
connection with Its production. This
culminated In the waste Incident to
the development of the Cashing field
In Oklahoma, which was probably the
most flagrant In the history of the
industry. It is estimated that from
80 to 80 per cent of the natural gas
In this field is irretrievably lost, Ex
perts estimate that It extended to al
most a billion feet a day, a total
since it began that would have sup
plied the domestic needs of a mil
lion persons for eight yeurs.
