SOUTH BEND,IND,,
SUNDAY SCHOOL
Finds Forest City "on the Map."—
Interesting Correspondence
"What Will ihe Harvest Be?"
The following letter is kind of
si "conundrum'' to the Editor of
the Press, which other people in
Forest City will doubtless share
with us, for the reason that the
(railroad) '"kears" are a minus
quantity, as well as the Sunday
School. But the "overturning"
process, begun when the original
townsite companies (capitalists)
iirst chose this spot of the old
Muddy to fight out their jealousies
and rivalries, 30 years ago, is still
in evidence, and it is to be hoped
that the bad seed then sowu will
soon be a thing of the past, eyen
as the Russian thistle is now being
supplanted on our grassy slopes
by sweet clover. While we have
not got the more expensive rail
road cars at our door, for the
South Bend Sunday School to
come to see us, we HAVE PASS
ED the stage-coach and the "cow
path", by which we are enabled to
visit the Railroad Station —either
C&NVV or CM&StP— in auto
mobiles to pay our respects to a
real delegation of the South Bend
S. S. wheneyer they will notify us
of their arrival, and give them a
joy-ride on our splendid "Red and
Yellow Trail" which we are sure
they will appreciate.
"South Bend, Indiana,
May 8, 1916.
"Dear Sunday School Superin
tendent
"I am writing you this letter in
the interest of The (irace Evan
gelical Sunday School. We are
located at the corner of Lincoln
Way West and Walnut Street in
the northwest part of the city.
"Our Sunday School is to start
on an imaginary trip beginning
the first Sunday in May. We are
going to visit one city each Sun
day, and Council Bluffs, Iowa,
was the first one on our map we
were there yesterday. We have
divided our school in two sides,
which is divided class against class,
the Mens Bible Class against the
Women's Bible Class, the Young
Men's Class against the Young
Ladies' Class, and so on down,
which we think will make the con
test all the more personal. The
points will be counted as miles and
are given for teachers present
with lesson so prepared as to be
able to teach it from the Bible
without any helps at hand. Bibles
will count so many points in the
hands of teachers or scholars, the
presence of each scholar will count
in points, the largest offering of
t,he different classes the same.
New scholars will count in points
and new members secured for
Cradle Roll and Home Department
are to be rewarded likewise."
"So next Sunday we are off for
Forest City, South Dakota, and
we want you (Superintendent) to
meet us at the train about 9:00 A.
M., and take us up to your Sunday
School and this is the way we are
expecting tobe in Forest City. Will
you kindly write us a letter telling
«s all about your Sunday School
and how to get there, also a few
points of interest in your city,
thereby making us feel that we
aye really in your city. We are
expecting to read your letter next
Sunday in our Sunday School.
Can you imagine how anxious we
are to hear from you. Don't for
get next Sunday, May 14th, is
when we want your letter. Ad
dress the letter to the winning
side of the Grace Evangelical Sun
day School and send it to George
W Devine, N. Allen Street.
South Bend, Indiana.
"We thank you for your inter
est in this matter and same will be
gladly appreciated by us all.""
LET THE PEOPLE RUE
R. O. Richards is certainly right
in his primary election law idea,
in making principles! instead of
persons the issue, in providing for
abolition of the official spoils sys
tem. in providing for public joint
debates, so that the people can
hear both sides before they vote,
in providing for minority aud ma
jority representation to foster a
line-up on the ballot under a prin
ciple so the people can see what
they vote for, as well as to estab
lish majority rule. The primary
elect ion law in government is like
the first corn rovv in a corn field.
"(Jet, it straight first before we
can straighten what has to follow."
Richards is right—vote "yes"
for the Richards Primary law at
next November election, and vote
for Richards for Governor at the
Primaries, May 23rd. —(Adv.)
SOAKING RA.INK
Cover Potter and Adjoining Counties,
Creeks Overflowing
Plenty of moisture to do now
till—the 4th of July! A drizzling
rain commenced here last Friday
lasting four days. It was the kind
of a rain where everybody agrees
it all went into the ground instead
of tbreefourths of it going into
the Missouri river. In such cases
there is but little, if any, erosion
of the land—which makes ns smile
again
"Lake Oliver" was full again,
but if now rapidh7 drying up.
The Little Cheyenne was raised
bank full, but now has gone down
to its normal level again.
Forest City streets as usual,
have already dried up so that there
is not a single uiudhole left iu the
business part of the city.
The river has been rising during
the past week and the indications
are that the "June Rise" has com
menc-ed, as driftwood made its ap
pearance Tues,evening, Will Mer
rill pulling to shore a 30-ft log.
Reports from Gettysburg and
surrounding: country are to the
effect that the snow there amount
ed to several inches. In Forest
City snow fell for a couple hours,
but melted as fast as jt touched
the ground
.T
Swiftbird creek was raised so
high that the flood took out a wag
on bridge. Reports were also in
circulation at the Agency that a
Milwaukee railroad bridge had
been washed out, but we have been
unable to get any particulars
"Lake Eidam" has been full all
spring, so that the present rain
has not noticeably affected it.
However, a little bog near
overflowing and sending the water
into the highway leading to Pierre,
The bog is supposed
its water from ati underground
flow from "Lake Eidam".

Sam Mound was over from the
Agency the other day to get our
village chnfl'. to take him to Get

had the pleasure of riding with
him. That, beats the old-time
stage coach—going over and back
in five hours and attending to*n
whole lot of business. This proves
that the "Beayer Gulch" is getting
well along toward a first class
highway.
