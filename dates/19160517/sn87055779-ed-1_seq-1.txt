In the high O'irt of justice mi the
harge of high treason. The com
mitment waj made by Magistrate
f-dr John Dickinson.
Just before the preliminary hear
ing at How st. police court came
to a close testimony was given to
the effect that Bailey claimed to
have come from America. loiter, it
was declared, he offered to turn
state's evidence if guaranteed his
freedom.
There were three more witnesses
to he called for the prosecution
wneii the hearing was resumed to
day in l'.ow si. police court.
Artemus Jones of counsel for
Casement and B.üley. planned to
iaie a few points for the defend
ants without calling any witnesses,
thus reserving his big tiht for the
higher court.
When Casement arrived in court
this morning Iiis hair was rumpled
and altogether he luoked as he had
f-ecured very little rest during the
night. As he took his seat Case
ment nodded to friends and rela
tives among the spectators.
Among the exhibits on the conn
sei table were ritles of the pattern
used by the Hussian army which
had been secured in the wreck of
the sunken filibuster Aude l v a
diver. These were evidently some
weapons captured from the Ru
sians by the Germnn army of Field
Marshal on Hindenhurg Their
presence on the filbuster evidenced
the part which the Gorman kov em

to foment rebellion in Ireland.

heard Bailey exclaim, when arrett
ed: "I hae some information which
will give voii fellows something to
do."
I.alley sat in the dock apparently
unconcerned. His planner showed
much less pert uro.it Ion than that of
Iiis fellow prisoner.

III-: 11 LIN (ia ayville wireless),
May 17. German newspapers in
commenting upon recent utterances
of Sir Fdward (Irey, the Hritish for
eign secretary, relative to the origin
and cause of the war, declare hat
they are "hardly apt to foster the
raus" of peace, although the Uritish
statesman does not use such high
sounding and hollow phrases as "Ger
many ought to be crushed.' which,
up until the present, was usually
given as F-pgland's object in the
war."
It is agreed by the press that s'ir
Edward repeats what the German
chancellor has already refuted in
his speech of Aug. 10. 191.", w hen he
d'srussed the declarations of Premier
Asquith unon a similar subject.
Premier Asquith then asserted that
Germany had made an impossible
pr.der--tanding with F.ngland by ask
ing Fngland's absolute neutrality
"in the event of Germany's being
engaged in war."
The chancellor has already stated,
it is pointed out. that Germany had
asked Hngland's neutrality "shouhi
var be forced upon Germany."
which is quite a different thing since
it excludes the possibility of aggres
sive intentions on Germany's part.
The newspapers also discuss 'Sir
Fdward Grey's assertions that Kiu-
1 ind had no aggressive intentions to
ward Germany. Hut they prove that
the contrary was true by quoting
secret reports of Heluian diplomats
RUSSIANS CAPTURE

PKTIK KIK AI. May 17. More
than ;57,0,i, Turkish troops have
teen capture J by the advancing
forces of Grand Duke Nicholas in
Asia Minor during the last three
weeks. Tlie Russians have also cap
tured vast quantities of munitions
which had been sent from (Jerman
factories and conveyed to the Otto
man front by prodigious effort.
The war office announcements of
continued progress indicate that the
attempts of the combined Turco
Gertnan forces In Asia Minor to
stem the Hussians march have
completely failed. The statement
that Mosul is being approached
shows that an enormous stride has
been taken by the grand duke
since he surmounted the mountains

lomacy had worked for years in
order to isolate Germany and expose
her to an attack by the coalition.
In this connection the newspapers
point out that the Felgian ambassa
dor to Germany on Dee. 6, 1M4. re
ported that "the entente cordiale"'
was not founded upon the positive
base of defense of common instincts,
but upon the negative base of hatred
toward Germany; "and also re
port the Belgian ambassador to
France as saying on Jan. 16. 1 1 1 4 .
that Messrs. I'pincare. Delcasse, Mil
It rand and Friend invented a na

Furthermore the press reports
Ihe Belgian ambassador to Germany
on Feb. ?, l:07, to the effect that
"it is impossible to doubt the sin
cerity of the German emperor's
paeitistic intentions since he has
furnished proof of them for IS
years."
A protest is raised by tlie press
acainst a discussion of the Belgian
problem by Sir Fdward Grey. The
chancellor stated, the newspapers
iccall. that Germany of course can
not admit of the reconstruction of
Belgium as she was before the war;
that is to say of Belgium as a bul
wark directed against Germany. But
the chancellor in his last speech in
dicates that (lernmiy wants a really
reu'r.il and independent Belgium.

as with any other country.

PARADE IS PUI
OP ROTARY CLUB
Demonstration and Coliseum
Building Are Taken Up
at Weekly Luncheon.
South Bend may have a prepar
edness parade similar to the one
held in New York last Saturday and
the one that is to march through
the streets of Chicago on June 1-.
The question was taken up at the
weekly luncheon and meeting of
the Rotarj club at the Oliver hotel
Wednesday noon. A. W. McKeand
of Indianapolis, talked on what
coliseums have done for other
cities and how those places had se
cured buildings of this kind.
Should South Bend stage a pre
paredness parade, it will be the
tirst city cutside of New York and
Chicago that has ever held any
thing of this kind. Other than ap
pointing a committee to take the
matter up with the Chamber of
Commerce nothing definite was done
by the Rotary ciub. The commit
tee is the regular civic committee,
the members of which are Itev. C.
A. Lippincott, John It. Haughton
and Miles V. O'Brien.
Mr. McKeand said that South
Bend's transportation facilities made
a coliseum an advisable proposition.
He said that a building of this kind
could be used 'for local meetings,
entertainments, various kinds of
shows. conventions and that a
market could be held in the build
ing. The speaker gave Wheeling's
coliseum as an example of a
market place in connetion with
the convention hall.
Tells of Psevs.
He told of the uses to which the
Atlanta coliseum was put. Mr. Mc
Keand said that the revenues from
the building permitted the city io
pay an organist $",U0U a year to
give Sunday afternoon concerts and
secure the best speakers and sing
ers in the country to give lectures
and concerts free of charge to the
people. Coliseums in Des Moines,
Denver, Kansas City and Baleigh,
N. C, were discussed. Mr. Mc
Keand told of the raising of $2."0.
0f,0 for the Louisville coliseum in
20 days.
Mr. McKeand was brought to tlx-l
city by the Chamber of Commerce
three weeks ago to talk on coliseums
before the board of directors. His
present trip to the city is to invest
igate the possibility of raising money
for a coliseum here. He will be
here until Thursday evening.
Members of the board of direc
tors were instructed to attend the
meeting of all organizations in the
county at the high school on May
to discuss the St. Joseph county
paceant. The board of directors is
made up of the following: Samuel
