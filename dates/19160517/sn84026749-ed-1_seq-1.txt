PRESIDENT
TO PEACE
FROM THE
Diplomatic Circles Here Agog
Over Answer to Communica-
' tion Mgr. Bonzano Delivered.
NO DEFINITE SUGGESTIONS
Wilson Falls to Bring Forward
Any Actual Plan to End War,
But Interest Is High.
President WMson has, sent a formal
reply to Pope Benedicts so called
''poc message."
Although It la denied In official circles
that either the communication from the
Vatican or the reply of the President
makes any.deflnlte suggestion looking to
a move by the United States to bring
about an end of the war In Europe, an'
nouncement that the reply had gone
created widespread Interest In dlplo
tnatlc circles here.
For more than a week tho Diplomatic
Corps has been agog with gossip con
cerning the prospects of an early peace,
and reports have been coming from tho
capitals of the warring powers Indlcat
tng that the subject Is oclng discussed
with moro or less serlousuqts among tho
nw luruis
Delegate Delivered Message.
The message from tho Popo was de
llvered to the President by Monslgnor
Bonzano, tho apostolic dclegato in
Washington, on the day following the
receipt of Germany's answer to the
near-ulttmatum of tho United States
' on the submarine question.
According In nfflrlala If HM nnt HUt.
ly suggest any step by the United States
by way of renewing Its offer of media
tion to the belligerent powers, but ex
pressed the hope that the President
would be able to keep the United States
put of tho war, In order that this coun
try might fulfill Us destiny of being the
power that might bring about peace.
Germany's answer, as pointed out by
The Times on the day It was received,
appeared to have been purposely dic
tated In parts with a view of conveying
.veiled, hint to th United States that
uormany wouj welcome a renewal. oi
President Wilson' efforts to- restore
peace.
Willing To End War.,
Deploring the possibility that the sub
marine controversy might Involve the
two countries and thus spread the
flames of the devastating war, tho Ger
man, note went on to remind tho Presi
dent that Germany has twice within
the last few months signified Its willing
ness to end the war on the basis of a
iuii recognition of tne territorial In
tegrlty of the countries at war.
In his reply to the Pope which was
delivered to Monslanor Bonzano bv
special messenger last Monday night,
the President for his part expresses the
hope that the United States will not be
drawn Into the war and thus have Im
paired Its prospects of being in posi
tion at the proper time to lead In the
movement fbr peace. It Is declared that
tho President did not directly Inform
the Pope that ho was willing to act at
this time.
The White House Itself refuses to
make any comment on the correspon
dence, regarding It as confidential and
not available for puollcatlon.
Vatican Has Acted.
In diplomatic circles It was learned
that within the last few days neutral
diplomats here have received from
their respective foreign offlcos Informa
tion to the effect that the Vutlcan has
been sounding tneso governments with
a view to having them muKe pt-aco
overtures to tho belligerents. The In
formation goes so Jar as to say that
It has been suggested that some of the
Peace Commissioners should be Loon
Bourgeois for Krance, Lord Hardlnge
for' Great Britain, and Prince von Bulow
tor Germany.
'ihe President Is known to have before
him at this time copies or a speech on
Peace delivered recently by President
oincare of France, and an Interview
'ill the same subject given to the news
paper by Sir Edward Grey, the British
minister for foreign affairs, it Is de
clared In Administration circles, how
ever, that while tre President Is follow
ing the question very closely, there have
been no definite developments which
would justify him In renewing the medi
ation overtures made by him at the out
set of the war.
It Is declared that the President would
not consider a direct appeal to the war
ring powers at this time unless both
rlds in the titanic struggle evinced a
willingness to be approached on the
ut:ect.

SCORES IN BARRING SLIP
In a grilling cross-examination of
Edwin D, Flather, summoned as a wit
ness by the prosecution in the perjury
trial of his brothers, William J. and
Honry H. Flather, and Charles C.
Glover, officers of tho Kings National
Bank, Attorney Frank J. Hogan, coun
sel for tho defense, today made a vig
orous attempt to emphasUo to the jury
that the bank Itself never bought nor
sold stocks.
Much evidence was adduced by the
prosecution through the examination of
the witness showing that stocks had
been bought and sold through officers
of the bank for patrons trading with
Lewis Johnson & Co.
From the beginning of his cross-examination,
Attorney Hogan directed his
questions with the evident purpose of
drawing from the witness declarations
that In each of the documents Intro
duced by the prosecution, the stock
was either bought or sold for patrons
of the bank by officials of the Institu
tion acting In their Individual capacity.
Teller Flather Recalled.
Edwin D. Flather, exchange teller In
tho Biggs Bank, and a brother of two
of the defendants, was asked to Identify
certain ledger sheets from tho bank's

to accounts, known In the trial ot the
case an the K. C. Babcock, C. b. Taylor

Intermittent exchanges over the In

30,000 Turks Withdrawn
To Meet Russ Advance
LONDON". May 17, Thirty thousand
Turkish troops have been withdrawn
from tho British front a8t ot Kut-Ill-Amara,
presumably to meet the
Russian advance on Bagdad, according
to dispatches received here today.
The Turks are recruiting all native
tribesmen capable of bearing arms
and moving them northward to tho
defense of Mosul, Prolongation of
the Tigris floods has made It possible
for the Turks to strip their lines
around Kut-Kl-Amara without fear
of an Immediate British advance.
In diplomatic circles here. It Is be
lieved that the Russians, after mass
ing formidable forces, are striking
swiftly against the Turks, acting on
tho theory that the war will come
to an end within a few months.
With Turkish territory more than
twice as large as all European Tur
key In their possession. It Is pointed
out here, the Slavs will be In a posi

theft of $30 ln cash from the apartment
ot Mrs. Anna Coulter, 143S Meridian
street northwest. A duplicate key was
used to gain entrance some time yester
