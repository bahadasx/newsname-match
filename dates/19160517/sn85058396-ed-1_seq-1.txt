DEBATE DELAYS
NEW ARMY BILL
Lodge Denounces Reduction in
Senate Provision for Size
of Regular Army.
wasuingion, may ii. aiuicks on
the provision for a government nitrate
plant Incorporated In the army bill
delayed adoption of the conferees re
port today In the senate. Senator
Hard wick of Georgia led in the attack
characterizing the provision as dan
gerous, socialistic and paternal.
The debate was broadened out by
Senator Lodge denouncing the reduc
tion in the senate provision for the
size of the regular army.
"With not a soldier left on tho At
lantic coast from Maine to Fortress
Monroe today they are taking the
coast artillery and the Pacific coast
is In the same condition all to take
care of the little trouble In Mexico,"
said Senator Lodge, "it seems to me
practically Incredible that either
branch of congress should be willing
to put $20,000,000 Into a nitrate plant
at Muscle Shoals or some other place
and not be willing to give the country
soldiers enough for Its immediate de
fense against troubles so trivial as
confront us on the border I do not
believe our conferees could have got
ten more. I am thankful for what
they did get, but I don't want senators
here to be under the delusion that
they have gotten what they should
have for their country."
Senator Newlands' suggested the ad
visability of refusing to accept the
conference report.
"I am not willing to run the risk of
losing what little wo have gained in
this bill," responded Senator Lodge.
"I think It was the original plan of
those In the house to do absolutely
nothing."
Senator Smith of Michigan declared
a current report that the war depart
ment had advance information of the
raid at Columbus, N. M., and had not
taken proper steps to prevent It,
should be Investigated. Senator Fall
agreed that the war department
should be Interrogated and said he
intended to address the senate soon

BAILEY'S STORY
TOLDJN COURT
Asks for Protection If He Tells
Truth About Sir Roger
Casement's Expedition.
London,'May 17,' 2:30 p. m. When
the court was reopened after lunch
eon tockiy it was disclosed that Bai
ley had made a statement to the po
lice under a guarantee that he would
receive "protection." Sergeant Brest
wick of the Royal Irish constabulary
who was in charge of the Ardney
barracks when Bailey was brought In
after his arrest, said he asked the
prisoner for the address of some per
son to whom he should communicate
the newB of Bailey's arrest. The pris
oner declined to give this informa
tion but later said he would tell the
sergeant "part of the truth."
The witness continued:
"Bailey then said: 'I came over
from America under false colors. I
Joined a society there but do not
want anyone to know who I am.'
When told he would be detained
until after the war, Bailey asked
whether he could go free if he told
the truth. The sergeant said he could
not promise him that but would guar
antee him protection,
Subsequently Bailey asked that dis
trict inspector, Brlcker. be sent for
Immediately insisting that tho next
day would bo too late.
This was on April 23 after receiv
ing a guarantee of protection Bailey
told the Inspector about the boat
which he said was to land arms tho
next dny.
Brlcker who was then called, testi
fied Bailey had asked that he be guar
anteed against punishment but was in
formed the only guarantee which
could be given was of protection. Bai
ley then told him, he testified, that
a Wilson liner captured by tho Ger
mans atjthe beginning of the war was
to put into Tralee the next morning
or perhaps that night to land 20,000
rifles, more than one million rounds
of ammunition, ten machine guns
ready for action nnd a supply of
bombs. He added that there would
be a general rising in Ireland simul
taneously Bailey described the lights
which the pilot borf for the steam
ship would carry.
"I knew at tho time," said Brlcker,
"that the vessel had been sunk, and
remarked 'supposing I told you that
the boat had been sunk?' He said
that could not be, as the boat was
not coming until Monday. lie then
told mo who he was and said he had
landed with Casement and Monteith
and that thoy had come from Ger
many In a German submarine."

PASSENGERS LOST
Austrian Ship Sunk by Subma
rines Had Women and
Children Aboard.
AUSTRIANS SEND NOTE
Two Torpedoes Fired Without
Warning by Enemy French
Are Accused of Telling
Untruths.
Berlin, May 17, by wireless to Tuck
erton. According to the Austro-Hun-garian
note sent to neutral powers re
garding the sinking of the Austrian
steamer Dubrovnik and other Austri
an vessels, the Dubronik had nine
teen passengers on board, including
several women and children. Threo
bodies of women were recovered and
four members of the crew and four
passengers are missing.
Tho Overseas News Agency in its
summary of the Austrian note says:
"A dispatch from Vienna states
that the Austro-Hungarlan govern
ment has delivered a note to the rep
resentatives of neutral powers stating
that on May 9 the Austro-Hungariau
passenger steamer Dubrovnik was
destroyed in the Adriatic by two tor
pedoes fired without warning by an
enemy submarine. The first torpedo
hit the starboard side and the ship
immediately began sinking.
"Ail on board rushed to the life
boats. Then a second torpedo struck
the ship, crushing the starboard life
boat with thoBe in it. It was possible
to rescue sixteen passengers In a
second boat. Two additional persons
were picked up from the water and
some were rescued by boats from the
shore.
Women and Children Aboard.
"On board the ship were nineteen
passengers, among whom were two
clergymen and several women and
children. Up to this time three
bodies of women have been recovered.
Four sailors and four passengers are
missing.
The Steffani agency on May 10
stated that a French submarine tor
pedoed the Dubrovnik, which was a
transport and carried ammunition.
This statement is a flat Invention.
The capacity of the Dubrovnik was
2S0 tons and she therefore was not
able to carry troops nor ammunition.
Besides this the distance of the sub
merged submarine from her was so
great that it was impossible for it to
discern the class of persons carried
by the steamer
"Tho Austro-IIungarian government
states that the firing of the second
torpedo against the sinking steamer
and the lifeboats which were afloat
must be qualified as 'intentional mur
der.' The Austro Hungarian govern
ment holds the Italian government
equally responsible with -the French
government since the French subma
rine was operating with the Italian
forces."
Tho News agency summary, after
to tho torpedoing of the hospital ship
Electra and attacks on tho steamer
Daniel Erno and Zagreb, concludes:
"The Austro-Hungarlan government
most emphatically protests against
the criminal acts mentioned "

Marathon, Tex., May 17. A truck
driver arriving here today from Bo
qulllas said that it was reported on
the border that Major Langhorne and
two troops of cavalry had surround
ed tho Big Bend bandit raiders about
125 miles -from the border, killing six
and capturing seventy-five.
Army officers here have made no
announcement regarding such an en
gagement According to the truck drivers re
port, the bandits were surrounded
and did not put up a tighL Tho Ameri
cans ceaBed firing at once.
The cavalry horses and equipment
captured by the bandits in their raid
on Glenn Springs two weeks ago were
recovered, it is reported.
The seventy-five captured, it was'
said, were to be brought here for trial.
In view of the previous reports from
Major Langhorne that he expected to
soon catch up with the bandits, the
authorities were inclined to place cred
ence in the report
Previous to overtaking the Mexi
cans, Major Langhorne's detachment
had rescued J. Deemer, the kidnaped
storekeeper, a negro, Monroe Payne,
and a Mexican employed by Mr. Deem-
A Mexican guide took the American
troops to the spot where the bandits
were encountered, the truck driver
said.

rescue by the American soldiers of
J. Deemer 'and the negro cook, Mon
roe Payne, carried off as prisoners
hv the bandits that raided Glenn
Springs and Boqulllas was reported
to General Funston today.
Their rescue alive was due, It is
said, to the refusal of the residents of
the village whero they had been left
to carry out the orders of the bandits
to kill them if the American troops
attempted their rescue.
Relief Felt In Washington.
Washington. May 17. Genuine re
lief over the Mexican situation was
evident in administration circles to
day. Tho principal cause was the as
surance convoyed to President Wilson
and his cabinet yesterday through
Secretary Baker that the Carranza
government now is convinced the
United States has no intention of In
tervening In Mexican politics, and that
consequently resentment against the
punitive expedition is rapidly decreas
ing. General Scott, chief of staff of the
army, brought this word to Secretary
Baker from his conference at El Paso
with General Obregon, war minister
for the Carranza government.

American residents of this section of H
Mexico have assured General J. J. H
Pershing, commander of the punitive M

have restored respect on the part of M
the natives for United States soldiers H
to a degree not existing for five H

For some time Mexicans had sneer- M

however, signs of the growing respect H
