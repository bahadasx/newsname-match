AGE ON ARMY
OE 260,000 MEN
At Conference Of Two
Houses Of Congress.
FEDERALIZED NATIONAL GUARD
To Be 425,000 Men Plans For
Government War Plants
Are O.'K'd.
A NATIONAL DEFENSE VICTORY
Washington, May 13. A standing
army of 260.000 men, capable of be
lag expanded in emergency to 251,
000 and backed by a Federalized
.National Guard of 425,000 as a re
serve, finally was agreed on to-day
by House and Senate conferees on
the army bill.
The agreement will be reported to
Congress early next week, and the
measure, the first of the Adminis
tration preparedness bills, is ex
pected to be before President Wil
son for his v signature soon after
"ward. Advocates of adequate national
defense regard the conference agree
ment as a triumph. The compro
mise between the House and Senate
measures was effected after weeks of
struggle against an insistent demand
from House conferees for a stand
ing army of only 140,000 men, and
vuntll to-day It had appeared that the
Senate might be forced to yield. The
Senate bill provided for 250,000.
The minimum enlisted strength
would be attained under the confer
ence agreement within the next five
years, and it is stipulated that at no
time shall the total be less than
160,000.
The conference report also pro
vides' for -GovernmentaJiItrate manu
facturing plants to cost not exceed
ing $20,000,000, for vocational ed
ucation in the regular army, arid for
establishment of military training
camps for volunteer citizens whose
transportation, clothing and subsist
ence expenses while in training
would be paid by the Federal Gov
ernment. The training camp feature a3 fi
nally reported is regarded as com
pensation in a measure, for the Fed
eral volunteer reserve of 261,000
men, which Senate conferees were
forced to abandon on insistence
Cfym the House.
Other salient features of the
measure provide for a board to in
vestigate the advisability of estab
lishing Government munltloiu
plants, and a board to recommend
mobilization of industries. Author
ity is given to the Government to
seize and operate private munition
plants In time of war.
In the agreement on the regulor
army the Senate bill system of or
ganization was retained as a substi
tute for the House system, which
would have recruited a maximum
nridy cf 140.000.
The regular line of the army, the
bill now provides, can never go be
low 160,000 and Its maximum
strength In times of peace would be
175,000 officers and men. In this
calculation, however, there are 'ex
cluded 5,723 Philippine scouts, 6,
409 In the quartermasters' corps,
7,290 In the medical department,
3,387 in the signal corps, and 8,750
unasslgned recruits, a total of 31,
650. These, added to the regular
line of 175,000 men, give a total
regular army peace strength of
206,659. The President is authoriz
ed to increase the regular army di
visions to maximum strength with
out Congressional action.

IS QUESTION OF EXPEDIENCY
German Feelings Deeply Wound
ed By the Aggressive Word
ing Of American Note.
WOULD LIKE TO Hli IMPUDENT
London, May 13. What purports
to be a summary of the speech of
Dr. von nethmann-HolIweg, the
German Imperial Chancellor, at the
secret sitting of the General Com
mittee of tho Reichstag on May 5
concerning Germany's reply to
America, Is published by the Wire
less Press under a Heme date. The
Wireless Press states that the fol
lowing remarks by the Chancellor
may be accepted aa unquestionably
authentic:
"I have said before that we must
drop all sentimentality. I repeat
that. With regard to cur dlsputn
with America, our self-respect was
wounded by the aggressive wording
of the American note to Germany,
Our feelings urge us to repel this in
terference with our legitimate meth
ods of warfare, and tell America to
mind her own business, but consid
erations of policy compel us to sub
ordinate patriotic zeal to patriotic
reason. We must be guided, how
ever, not by our feelings, but by the
coolest Judgment.
"We have one aim and one duty,
namely, to win the war; therefore,
any policy which endangers our vic
tory must be avoided. .The over
whelming majority of.Mexpert opin
ion regards a rupture of relations
with America as a grave peril.
"A grave mistake has been com
mitted in overstating tlic value of
the submarine (.campaign against
England. Our naval experts no lon
ger believe in the probability of re
ducing England to starvation and
ruin by submarines even if the war
lasts another two years. It Is truo
that these Instruments can Inflict a
frightful amount of damage, but
this damage would be Insufficient to
outweigh the danger tb ourselves of
America's hostilities.
"It Is follw to underestimate the
consequences of a conflict with
America, nor should we risk only
America's enmity. Our information
leads us to believe that other neu
trals might follow America's lead.
"The Imperial Government has
weighed every factor and Is convinc
ed of the necessity of avoiding a
breach with America.
"These are the hard facts of the
present situation. Wo have worded
a reply such as may reserve future
liberty of action. If tho situation
changes, we may cancel our 'conces
sion to America and resume unre
stricted submarine operations, but
for the present wo must overcome
our feeling and pursue tho policy
most conducive to final victory over
all, our enemies."

OF
' COL ROOSEVELT
Snown In His Attitude
Regarding Mexico.
CLAIMS HE ST000 STEADFAST
For American Honor, But Rec
ords Show Insults Under
His Administration.
AFFRONT; T" FLAG NUMEROUS
The New i'ork Evening Post
punctures the claims of Colonel
Roosevelt that during all the time
ho was President no American was
killed b ya foreign nation, and shows
on the other hand that Insults to the
flag were. numerous. The Evening
Post says:
In Col. Roosevelt's address to the
Methodists the other evening his
latest concio ad clerum he appar
ently followed the model of Lacor
dalre. For it was of him that Gul
zot wrote: "His history and the
ology were full of originality. In
deed, they were absolutely original,
for he Invented them as he went on.
This gave to his sermons the charm
of perpetual novelty."
To the credulous Methodists Mr.
Roosevelt made this statement:
"I wa3 President seven and a half
years. This nation during all that
time never for one moment permit
ted any Power to wrong this coun
try or to wrong Americans either In
th,elr persons or property or to make
us recreant to our duty to others;
and yet during those seven and a
half years not one shot was fired by
anK man In American soldier's
uniform against any foreign foe, and
not one American man, woman or
child was slain by representatives of
any foreign nation."
His reference was to Mexico.
Very well; turn to the Tribune In
dex for 1904, under "Mexico." We
And the entry, July 22, "Two Amer
icans Shot." In the year 1905, the
record for January IS is "I. A. San
ger Murdered," and for January 22,
"Yaquls Kill Four Americans.'' But
the tell-tale years Is 190C. Tho
"Insults" to our flag were piled
thick. Here are some of the en
tries: "American Fishing Boats
Seized;" 'American Fishermen Jail
ed;" "American Sailors Charge Tor
tures." It was In June of 190G that
occurred the crowning "Infamy"
as Roosevelt would have called it If
it (had taken pladi under Wilson.
Read this: "How Americans Died
at Cananea." And then, oh, shame
faced Americans, read this: "Root
Denies American Troops to Cana-
npri!"
There had been a murderous oat
break at the Cananea mines. Sev
eral Americans were killed. What
did the' Imperiled American survi
vors do? They sent to Washington,
through the American Consul at
Cananea, a telegram urgently call
ing for help. Even the Mexican
Governor of Sonora was reported as
asking that the United States Gov
ernment send In a military force.
But what happened? Why, Secie
tary Root consulted the Chief of
Staff, and "the law officer of tho
War Department" think of the dis
grace of actually looking up tho
law! and decided that American
troops "must not cross fche line."
Imagine it! Uncle Sam putting on a
pigtail like that, when Roosevelt
was President!
That this was a cowardly nnd ab
ject policy, we know on the highest
authority. For It was Mr. Roose
velt himself who laid down the eter
nally righteous prlnclplo In that
same. speech of his to the Method
ists. Referring to the fact that
Americans had been killed In Mex
ico while Wilson was President, he
eald:
"If the very first time such nn In
cident occurred, we had acted with
Instant decision and crossed the bor
der, not within two or threp days,
but tMrty minutes afterward, had
Inflicted Iniinedlata punishment on
tho offenders, punishment of a kind
which- 'would have shown the ex
treme unwlsd6m of repenting the
offense, there would never huvo beon
a repetition of tho offense. Certain
foolish pacifists' nt home would un
doubtedly have teeu lackadaisical
DECEPTION
over the action, but It would have
saved hundreds of lives."
Alas, my brethren, the very first
time was when Roosevelt was Pres
ident, and Instead of acting with in
stant decision and crossing tho bor
der in thirty minutes, he paltered
with the affair like a lackadaisical
pacifist, and would not send the
troops at all though they were de
manded by tho beleaguered Ameri
cans at Cananea. The great doc
trine of 1916 was trampled upon In
1906 by the very man who now pro
pounds It.
What are we to say about such
displays of inconsistency by Col.
Roosevelt? Do they prove that he
Is an unblushing liar? That would
be far too simple an explanation of
his complex psychology. He be
lieves only what he wishes heartily
to believe. His memory Is so excel
lent that It retains nothing that it
would be unpleasant for him to re
member. And when the records are
brought out which seem to prove
that he has stultified himself, no one
'is more surprised than he.

STATE CONVENTION OF
THE PROHIBITION PARTY
Mrs. Frances E. Beauchamp,
State Chairman of the Prohibition
party In Kentucky, has called a
State convention of thej jiarty to
meet at the Watterson hotel in
Louisville, May 24 and 25.
In the official call Mrs. Beau
champ states that every method of
dealing with the liquor traffic has
been tried, and has failed, and that
it has been clearly demonstrated
that the only proper remedy is pro
hibition. All persons interested in
and sympathizing with the prohibi
tion movement are urged to attend
the convention In Louisville.
Mrs. Beauchamn compares the
prohibition movement to tho nation
al preparedness movement, and ar
gues that the country can do noth
ing more calculated to increase na
tional efficiency than to bring to an
end tho manufacture and sale of Hi
quor.

UNLOADED GUN CLAIMS
A VICTIM IN CHRISTIAN
Hopklusvllle, Ky., May 13. The
unloaded gun claimed another vic
tim this afternoon about 4 o'clock
when Gus Woosley, a highly re
spected young farmer of the Ceru
lean Springs neighborhood, was kill
ed by a shot from a rifle In the
hands of his little nephew. The
bullet passed entirely through Mr.
Woosley's chest and he lived only
half an hour. He and the boy had
been handling the rifle for some
time, thinking It was unloaded but a
cartridge had beon left In the cham
ber and when the child pulled the
trigger it exploded. The accident
occurred at Mr. Woosley's home.
His father Is John R. Woosley, a
merchant of Trenton, Ky., and ho Is
also survived by his bride of two
months, four brothers and one sis
ter. Wheat Promises LlRlit Yield.
Franklin, Ky., May 15. The
growing wheat In Simpson county Is
said by tho farmers to promise the
lightest yield In a dozen years. A
few late crops will average well, but
In other cases total failure will re
sult on account of tho ravages of the
Hessian fly.
LIGHTNING HITS TWICE
BOTH OASES CORN CRIB
Henderson, Ky., May 13. Col.
R. K. Soaper lost a crib filled with
corn when the building was struck
by lightning and destroyed. The crib
contained 12,000 bushels of fine
corn. The loss was partially cov
ered by lusurance.
Five yenr3 ago a similar crib half
filled with corn was struck by llsht
nlng and destroyed. Both buildings
stood on tho same spot. The second
stroko of lightning explodes the old
saying that lightning never strikes
twice In the samo place.
Col. Soaper now Iiub about 30,000
bushel3 of corn in other cribs, and
he says ho Is going to hold It until
the price roaches $1 a bushel.
TACIT AGREEMENT
FOR COOPERATION
Between American and
Mexican Troops.
Is Said To Have Been Reached
Troops Will Stay While
Outrages Occur.
NO INTERVENTION INTENDED
El Paso, Tex., May 13. Juan N.
Amador, Sub-secretary of Foreign
Affairs of the do facto government,
who participated In the conference
with Gen. Obregon, Minister of War,
called on Gen. Scott here and assur
ed him that such troop dispositions
?s were necessary to restore and
maintain order along the frontier
already had been ordered.
Gen. Obregon, who will remain
for a few days at Chihuahua City,
lias directed Gen. Trovino to senu
10,000 men into the States of Chi
huahua nnd Coahulla. These forces
will be taken from Torreon San Pe
dro and other points in the southern
part A Coahulla. Trevino's head
quarters will be in Chihuahua City.
Immediate occupation of the dis
trict about Parral has been ordered,
and what the Muxlcrhs regard as
an adequate force will be dispatched
to tho Big Bend country to capture
the bandits and secure James Dee
trur, who was captured in the Glenn
Springs and Boquillas raid.
Gen. Scott previously had assured
Gen. Obregon and Mr. Amador that
the withdrawal of the American
troops from the district below Na
mlquipa already had begun, and Mr.
Amador asserted that this district
would be controlled without loss of
time by Mexican forces. .
Secretary Amador explained that
the questions involved In the proto
col governing the mutual agreement
for the crossing of troops into one
and the other countries must be tho
basis of these negotiations, although
the withdrawal of the American
troops stipulated In Carranza's note
of April 12 must also be considered.
Mr. Amador made it clear that
Gens. Scott and Funston had reiter
ated the assertions of the Adminis
tration that it was not the intention
of the United Sate3 Government to
keep the troops in Mexico Indefinite
ly, and that, therefore, he did not
attach so much importance to this
as had been given to It In some
quarters.
"And you may be certain," said
Mr. Amador, "that the danger of a
conflict between Mexican troops and
American soldiers pending these ne
gotiations does not exist."
Gen. Obregon's army In Sonora
will remain there for the present,
according to Mr. Amador, although
ho said a request probably would be
made later for the passage of a por
tion of the troops from Sonora east
ward, either through American ter
ritory or through the American Una
of communications.
Secretary of War Baker sent to
Gens. Scott and Funston congratu
latory telegrams on the maimer In
which they had conducted the nego
tiations with the Mexican conferees.
Trow Will Stay.
Washington, May 13. Secretary
Baker anuouueed here after a Cab
inet meeting that no change In the
Mexican policy had been decided
upon. No new orders for mllltla or
ganizations to go to the border were
in contemplation, he said, and Indi
cated that no genernl intervention In
Mexico was being thought of at pres
ent. Renewed indications wero given
that the Administration has no In
tention of withdrawing American
troop until it is definitely establish
ed that tho danger of further border
raids lms been removed. In tho
meantime American troops will be
so arranged that they will be ready
to meet any eventuality and protect
the American border.
