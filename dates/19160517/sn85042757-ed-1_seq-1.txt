The Booster Period ot two weeks
proved so successful and was such an
encouragement to the contestants that
we have decided to give one more
Booster Period. This is done mainly
to encourage a few persons who have
manifested an interest in the contest
since the other Booster Period was
started. In this instance we shall
make the otter more liberal than be
fore because there is little likelihood
of another Booster Period being put on
during the contest.
this time we shall give 5,000 votes
for twelve cash subscriptions, or $18.00.
The Booster Period will close Wed
nesday, May 31. That gives you two
weeks in which to interest your friends
at a distance; write them and let them
know what you are working for and
just why you need their help to get
that 5,000 extra votes. Those who
worked in earnest in the othr Booster

best and most useful citizenship.
For several years the institution has
been conducting extensiw farming ac
tivities particularly along those lines
that provide the most food for the
school, h'ach year the conditions have
grown better and now the prospects
are splendid. Under the efficient man
agement of Herbert Smith, manager
and director of the farm work, they
are not only growing food crops and
raising live stock but are practicing
such rotation of crops and the growing
ot legumes as is building up the farm
after the most approved methods ot
scientific agriculture. This is a splen
did object lesson and a direct encour
agement to the youths who attend the
institution and who come from the
farm or whose bent is in that direction.
Last year the farm produced 800
bushels of Irish and sweet potatoes,
the most of which were used by the in
stitution, while the surplus was sold.
They have sold ten head of young stock
that brought $225; in the tall these
will be replaced to consume the teed
grown on the farm and provide beef tor
the boarding hall.
For this year the potatoes and corn
are all planted and the general appear
ance ot the farm is most gratifying.
Owing to the business depression the
institution has been somewhat hamper
ed for lack of funds but the year is ex
pected to close without a deficit.
All in all Pleasant Hill Academy has
been doing a aplenciiu work in prepar
ing young people for the duties of life.
The moral tone of the ir.stitution has
always been very high and the spirit
of manly and womanly conduct has
been very strong. I 'rot'. IV. E. Wheel
er is a man oi spie din generalship, of
unsweiving loyalty to duty and a tire
less worker. It is ti i .re due lo his wise
direction and spic'vi.ii ovtrsignt than
any other one thi r t h'.t the institution
stands as so splei. jio .Monument for our
OKuLit or r-jAhiiCleihc!.
Not by any means I it stands 4 feet
high, has double doors to the body and
six shelves tor holding records. It is a
beautifully mahogany finished case
that would prove an ornament to any
home, it has a very strong and clear
tone and is one of the best talking ma
chines made. The picture here shown
gives you a fair idea of what it is to
look at but you cannot knew what ex
excellent tone it has and how loud it
plays unless you come in and hear it.
When you remember it is a regular
$150 machine, you will understand that
it is no toy but is a piece of practical
and useful furniture for the most re
fined home. Come in and hear it play
and see what a beauty it is and how
splendidly it plays.
Miss Winifred Patton, Crab Orchard,
and Miss Sarah Bristow, Grassy Cove,
won the Buster Brown Kodaks in our
last offer. -
It will be seen that the public is get
ting interested in the contest as sever
al votes have been received to the
credit of some who are considerably
behind. This i a sure evidence that
your friends at a distance will help you
if you write them urging them to help
you win he 5,000 free votes. Try it
and see.

PLEASANT HILL ACADEMY
Closes Thirty-Second Year of Work
Soon; Exercises Commence Friday,
Baccalaureate Sermon Sunday
and Closes Next Wednesday.
Co amencement exercises of Pleasant
Hill Academy for the thirty-second
year, wil! open Friday night witn a
reception for the senior class of twen
ty, probably one of the largest ever
turned out by the school in any one
year. Two of the number complete
the three-year high school course and
eighteen the regular two year course.
In the class there are students from
ten counties and two are from Kansu
Province, China.
The en roll m en t tins year has not
been so large as in some former years
but has reached about 300. The board
ing students have numbered about 130.
The Baccalaureate sermon will be
preached Sunday by Rev. W. W. Simp
son, for twenty years a missionary in
China, and a former graduate of Pleas
ant Hill Academy, of the class of 1890.
CANTATA, TUESDAY NIGHT.
Tuesday night of next week a Can
tata, entitled "Josephs Bondage,"
will be rendered by the Handel Society
of the Academy. Much time and ener
gy has been spent on it and it will
doubtless prove a very interesting tea
tare of the closing exercises of the
school. The director, Mrs. Whitlow,
is deserving of much credit and com
mendation for the splendid service ren
dered in the musical department of the
inatitution, both instrumental and vo
cal. She entered the Academy when a
little girl, completed the literary course
and has now advanced to the important
position of directing the musical de
partment of the institution.
It is very gratifying to look over the
program and note how the subjects
chosen for orations and essays deal
with farming and bome-maRing. Prof.
Wheeler informs us that those subjects
were chosen by the graduates without
being influenced in that direction.
That very fact speaks most highly for
the instiution for it shows beyond ques
tion that the trend of the training the
students receive is such as leads their
minds to the most practical things of
life: That of providing food and build
ing good homes. There is no higher or
more noble calling and the young peo
ple whose minds lean in that direction
are certainly taking that wise and
practical view of life that leads to the
Friday May 1H.
