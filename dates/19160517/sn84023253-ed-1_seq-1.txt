APPARENTLY LED ALL CONTESTAN TS IN YER
MOHTS FIRST PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY
ROOSEVELT IS SECOND
Exceedingly Light Vote Cast McCall Ran Strong In Caledonia County
But Did Not Figure Elsewhere Democratic Vote Solid For Wilson
Roosevelt Led Hughes In Newport and St. Albans Vote In
Caledonia, Chittenden and Rutlann Counties.
Vermont republicans declared them
selves strongly in favor of Charles E.
Hughes, associate justice of the
United States Supreme court, at the
first preferential primary in the his
tory of the state held yesterday. The
combined votes of republicans and
progressives for Theodore Roosevelt
made him a por second in the repub
lican contest, while Woodrow Wilson
received more votes than Roosevelt in
the returns secured last evening.
With two small towns missing in
Rutland and Caledonia counties and
Chittendon county complete the vote
for the different candidates was:
For Hughes- 1,790
For Wilson 1,147
For Roosevelt ...1,031
For McCall 151
For Root 55
Scattering 45
Caledonia county gave McCall his
151 votes and the 55 votes given as
scattering in Rutland county are for
Mr. Root. John W. Weeks of Mas
sachusetts did not have enough to
classify.
Only about 10 per centof the total
registration of voters went to the bal
lot box and the first trial of Ver
ment's primary law certainly cannot
be called very decisive.
The morning papers of the state
collected the returns In each of their
counties and exchanged summaries.
The full returns will not be known
until collected and published by the
secretary of state. The summaries for
the three counties follow:

BIG SALE OF HEREFORDS
Thirty-Two Head of Pure Bred Cat
tle Sold at Public Auction for
$8,000 Highest Price $000.
The first auction sale of pure bred
Hereford cattle in Vermont was held
at the Caledonia County Fair grounds
Thursday and was a very successful
sale, 32 head of cattle selling at an
average price of $250 a head or a total
of $8,000. About 300 men from all
sections of New England and the
Middle West were in attendance and
the bidding was quite spirited. Sev
eral bids were sent by mail from west
ern parties but their offers were not
high enough to get the cattle.
The highest price paid for an ani
mal was $600 for the three-year-old
bull. Beau Blanchard. 3d. He wan
consigned by II. E. Morrison & Son
of Orford, N. H., and was sold for
$600 to H. L. Phillips of Alexander,
N. H. He also bought the cow Evelyn
Fairfax, paying $500 for her. Anoth
er low, Isabel Fairfax, also brought
$500. The lowest price paid for any
animal was $100 for the yearling bull.
Perfection's Last.
One of the animals sold goes to
Kentucky and the remainder were
taken by New England buyers. A
part of the cattle consigned for the
sale were previously sold at private
sale to go to South America.
FARMERS NOT CONTRIBUTING.
Caledonia County Farmers Association
Must Have More Money or Quit.
At a meeting of the executive com
mittee of the Caledonia County Farm
ers association, held at the office of
County Agent Wood Saturday evening
the finances of the association were
discussed.
It was stated that unless thr farm
ers were ready to contribute their
dollar each the association would
have to close business, as it Is short
of money. The $200 necessary to raise
In order to get the appropriation from

year In addition to the town appro
priations to finance its operations for
a year.

HOLDING JOE OUELETTE.
He Will Be Sentenced for Forgery in
Canada Before Coming Here.
Sheriff Worthen has telegraphed the
chief of police at Lambton Village,
Que., asking that if Joe Ouelette who
is wanted here for forgery appeared
at that place to hold him for the
Vermont authorities. He has receiv
ed a reply from A. McCarthy, chief
of police of Quebec city, that a man
answering Oulette's description was
being held there and had partly ad
mitted his guilt. He was being held
for sentence there on a plea of gull
ty on the charge of forgery. So it
will probably be some time before
the Vermont authorities can deal with
him.
Presented With Loving Cup.

England Conference, held at Worces
ter, Mass., Bishop John W. Hamilton,
D. D.. L.L.D., who will lecture in
