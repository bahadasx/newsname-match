Suggests "Big Stick" Appropri

New York, May 17. The New York
Times, a Democratic paper often
frank in its criticism of Theodore
Roosevelt, has published a remarkable
editorial acknowledgment of T. R.'s
vital relation to the new and overpow
ering issues of the nation. It sees a
now and greater opportunity and de
mand than ever before was presented
for the exercise of Colonel Roose
velt's power to arouse the people to a
Fens1 of national danger.
The political sensation that was cre
ated recently when the New York Tri
bune, a stand-pat Republican news
paper, came out recently with its edi
torial pronouncement that the Repub
lican national convention should come
to the nation's rescue with Colonel
Roosevelt for the presidency was
rather mild compared with the one
that was set in motion by an editorial
that has just appeared in the New
York Times. Its words of praise for
the man of Oyster Hay almost passeth
the understanding of those active and
on the side lines of the great political
game. For years, the Times has been
one of Colonel Roosevelt's severest
critics- Most folk would have thought
that the Times would choke to death
before it could speak of Mr. Roose
velt's "brilliant and marvellous ca
reer," or confess that he is the man of
the hour, and the pnly American that
can arouse his fellow citizens to the
needs of their nation. But the New
York Times actually says these very
things and most gracefully and hand
somely in the editorial in question,
which It presents as follows under the
caption "Air. Roosevelt's Opportu-'
nity."
"Mr. Roosevelt's hat is always in
the riner. and his ln.teKt notice of his
readiness for the shindy is super- !
liuous tor public comprehension or
his political intentions. It is timely,
however, as a reminder to the officers
of the Old Guard that they must not
presume too much upon his yielding
to 'harmony. Just at the moment when
the reactionaries, conservatives, and
straitest sect of Republican partisans
were trying to persuade themselves
that he was going to be reasonably do
c;Ie, and that they had him 'benton to
a tuazzle,' he stands up and proclaims
afcyin the conditions precedent -"f Re

fortunes of his own candidacy need

"The national Republican party, by

its representatives in congress, has
given to the Democrats the merit ot

serters of American rights. The
country will hear a good deal next

Clever Ruse of Police in Hunt
ing Down the Suspect. v
Warrants were issued in. the court
of Topeka this morning for Earl
Franklin Sims, William Butler and F.
M. Nelson, charging them with enter
ing the Fritton grocery at 1000 and
1002 East Fourth street and blowing
the safe with nitro-glycerine.
There are two complaints in each
case, one charging burglary and the
other charging larceny.
Sims is an adopted son of Frank
Sims, former county commissioner.
Butler was also an adopted son and
his foster parents are now dead. Nel
son is a drifter.
The issuance of the warrants fol
lowed a complete confession made by
young Sims to the police last night in
which he told in detail of the bur
glary committed during the night of
April 8.
Two Arrests Yesterday.
Butler and Nelson were arrested af
ter & o'clock Tuesday afternoon. fcims
has not yet been arrested but he will
be, according to Harvey Parsons, chief
of police. Butler is held in the county
jail and Nelson in the city jail, in or
der to keep them from getting togeth
er on a story.
The night of April 7 the powder
house of the W. A. L. Thompson
Hardware company west of town was
broken into and a large quantity of
dynamite was carried, away. This, ac
cording to Sims's story, was taken to
the cellar of the Butler house on Ad
ams street and cooked until the nitro
glycerine was secured in liquid form.
And it was this "soup' that was used
on the Fritton safe. Sixty-two dollars
was secured fro Tnthe safe,
if "AH three, men disappeared .inaxna
Wiately following the burglary, aims
returned some time ago but was not
arrested by the police for fear that
would keep Butler -and Nelson from
returning-' to Topeka. It was a wom
an who finally tipped the officers off
to the fact that Butler was back in
town Butler's sweetheart and she
did it unintentionally. They knew she
had left town with him and when she
was seen in Topeka they suspected he
was also" in town. Her name is Hazel
Kfctes and she is a sister of Charles
Kstes, ex-convict and now a fugitive
from justice.
ITsed Fireman Uniform.
The Butler home is located at 127
Adams street and was inherited by
Butler. IjAto yesterday afternoon,
after Hazel Estes had been seen on
the street, the police department
"borrowed" a fireman and a fireman's
uniform. They clothed Bob Miler, city
detective, in the uniform,- and he and
the fireman went down on Adams
street inspecting houses. They in
spected all the houses in the block
where Butler lives. They tapped
chimneys and walls and looked at
stoves. They went through tbe But
ler house and found no one until they
reached the last room and came near
finding no one there. The mattress
on the bed had a peculiar appearance
and Miler made a closer inspection of
it. He found "Bill Butler between
the mattress and the springs making
himself as thin as possible.
Nelson has been driving a jitney in
Topeka and has been keeping it at
night not fifty feet from the police
station. Tom Morgan, plain clothes
man, picked him up on the street
about 8 o'clock last night. After se
curing both Butler and Nelson, Chief
Parsons called Sims to the police sta
tion and Bob Miler secured the confes
sion from him, signed in the presence
of A. C. Bartel, justiceof the peace.

' London, May 17. Sir Roger Case
ment and Daniel J. Bailey were com
mitted for trial today for nigh treason.
This decision was reached at the
conclusion of the preliminary hearing
of these men on the charge of partiei- ,
pation in the Irish rebellion, which !
has been in progress since Monday. ;
The date of the trial and the court
before which it will be held have not
yet been announced.
When the case was reopened today
Constable Carter of the Royal Irish
constabulary was recalled lor cross ex
amination at the request of the; de
fense. The trend of the questions in
dicated that at the time of his arrest
Bailey attempted unsuccessfully to
gi v e in f orm atio n to th e po li ce in re
gard to the projected uprising.
Bailey Tips Off Sensation.
Carter said he had not heard Bailey
say . after his arrest that he had a
statement for the authorities but that
at another time he did hear Bailey
say:
"I have important information
which will give you police something
to do."
A Russian colonial, Nicholas Be-
laiew, identified the rifle produced in
court yesterday which was taken by
a diver from the wreck of the Ger
man steamship Aud. as one made la
the Russian Poula works in 1915. The
cartridges, however, were not of Rus
sia! make. The inference drawn by
those in court was that part of the
war material shipped from Germany
corsisted of captured Russian rifles,
ammunition for which was made in
Germany.

attending the annual convention of

today by Bishop Kdwin D. Lines to
preserve absolute neutrality, in their
pulpit utterances.
"It may be idle to tell men gener
ally to be neutral," he said, "but every
clergyman should feel his responsibil
ity, knowing that public utterances
are largely responsible for the shaping
of public opinion and causing racial
animosities.
"We should be particularly careful
to refrain from criticism of the ad
ministration's foreign policy. Ameri

and we should give the administration
