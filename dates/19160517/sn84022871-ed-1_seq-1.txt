Listers' Abstract Completed
The listers completed their abstract
Monday and the Monitor is pleased to
give a summary of the figures as fol
lows:
Total appraised valuation of
real estate for taxation $1,460,565
Total appraised
valuation of per
sonal est. for
taxation $648,740
Total deducton for
debts owing 53,130
Personal val. for taxation
595,610
Total appraised val. of real
and personal for taxation $2,056,175
1 per cent of total val. of.
real and personal $20,561.75
Total appraised valuation of
taxable polls 2,022.00
Total grand list $22,583.75
Town outside of villages 5,709.30
Barton incorporated village 8,263.75
Orleans incorporated village 8,610.70
Town school district 4,439.75
B. A and graded school dist. 9,040.55
Orleans graded school dist. 9,103.45
This is a shrinkage in the grand list
of only $318, which is considered re
markable since there is an offset law
this year. It will be noted that there are
1011 polls, a slight gain over the num
ber last year. The listers found $162,
328.30 worth of five per cent paper,
which is exempt from taxation under
the law.
It is to be noted that the Orleans
list, both village and school district
exceeds that of Barton this year for
the first time.
Grade Children in Entertainment.
Nearly 200 children from the public
school will take part in the annual en
tertainment given by the grades, in
Seaver'shall Wednesday evening, next,
at 8 o'clock. There will be chorus
singing, dialogues, drills, dramatics
and other exercises by the boys and
girls. A general admission of ten cents
will be charged and the children will
sell tickets. The event has always
drawn a crowd and is bound to be a
big ten cents' worth.

FIRE DESTROYS TUB SHOP
Complete Destruction of Barton's Lead
ing Industry. Fifty Men out of
Work. Loss $25,000.
Fire broke out about 5 o'clock Wed
neday afternoon in the boiler room of
the Vermont Butter Tub company's
plant during the momentary absence
of the engineer, destroying the main
buildings, machinery and dry kiln,
which contained a large stock of dry
staves and thousands of feet of box
lumber.
The fire is supposed to have origi
nated in the waste in the boiler room
and the flames spread from the waste
to the carrier and then to the main
shop all so rapidly the workmen were
barely able to escape, leaving all extra
clothing and tools. The fire companies
responded promptly, but had only two
effective streams of water with which
to fight the flames, which made rapid
progress. The Cary Maple Sugar com
pany's warehouse took fire and the
storehouse of the E. W. Barron com-
tany was threatened, out Dotn were
saved by the good work of the firemen
although the Cary building was some
what burned and its contents removed.
The firemen deserve credit for keeping
the fire from the storehouse of the fac
tory in which between $10,000 and
$15,000 worth of tubs were stored
But for a favorable wind this building
might have been a total loss. The loss
of the tub shop takes one of. Barton'3
leading industries and it is not probable
that the factory will be rebuilt as the
company hud contemplated moving the
machinery to Maine, where it has
standing timber.
" The loss is estimated between
$25,000 and $30,000 and the company
carried about $20,000 insurance. L. 1.
Hall of Montgomery Center, president
of Nelson Hall company and the Ver
mont Products company and secretary
and treasurer of the Vermont Butter
Tub company, was in town Saturday to
meet the employees of the factory,
offering them positions in Greensville,
Me. Five men left Monday night and
others will go later. The office of the
company is at present located in the
office of J. F. Batchelder in the Jtiatcn
elder block. Local Manager Cook says
he expects to go to Maine within a few
weeks. Fifty men were employed here
and are now out of employment. The
loss means much to Barton as the com
pany was the largest employer of male
help in town.

PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY
Vermont Republicans Two to One for
Hughes over Roosevelt for Presi-
dent. First Primary Vote Light.
The voters of Vermont had their
first experience with a primary yester
day. It was not a full-fledged primary
bceause no nominations were made,
but it afforded an opportunity for those
who desired to register their preference
for a presidential nominee. Because
of the late hour at which the polls clos
ed (eight o clock m the evening) it is
an impossibility to give complete re
turns in the state. From returns at
hand it appears that Justice Hughes
leads former President Roosevelt two
to one, and that Presdient Wilson had
practically no opposition in his own
party.

Methodist Episcopal Church Notes.
Rev. I. A. Banney, Pastor
You are cordially invited to attend
all services.
Morning worship, 10.45.
Sunday school, 12 o'clock.
Epworth League, 6 o'clock.
Evening service at 7 o'clock.
Sunday being generally observed as
Mother's day, the pastor preached an
appropriate sermon the subject being,
"Mothers in Israel." No iniluence is
so potent, no inspiration so soul-stirring
as a mother's. Mothers give chil
dren their ideals, through these comes
character and upon character hangs the
weal and woe of a nation. By mothers
I mean those who have been true to
the responsibilities thrust upon them.
A mother's influence is next to God's
for a true mother never ceases lovinor
her child. Every boy and girl needs a
grip that will hold and every mother
should see that they have such a grip
upon Jesus Christ. No greater work
can be done than that which the
Christian mother is doing in training
her children for usefulness.
The Epworth League had charge of
the evening service, using a special
program for mother's day. This con
sisted of special music and readings
and a short talk by the pastor on
"Famous Mothers and Their Influ
ence." The program closed with the
installation of the officers of the
League for the ensuing year, followed
y the League benediction.

Persistent Advertising Pays.
One great, flashy advertisement may
attract attention and also lang some
orders, but it is the steady, persistent
advertiser whose results are eminently
satisfactory- It does not do to adver
tise spasmodically. Your results will
be far better, if you use small space
continually than to "plunge" and then
stop. Western Monthly.
