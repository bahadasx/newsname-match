A WACO, TEXAS, iioiuum.
Negro, ( on vic ted und Sentenced,
Taken by Mob and Humed.
Waco, Texas, May 15.-With 15,
000 persons as witnesses, including
women and children. Jesse Washing
ton, a negro boy, who confessed to
the assault and murder of Mrs. Lucy
Pryar, seven miles south of hore last
Monday, was taken from the Kif th
District court room shortly before
noon and burned on the public
square.
The burning came Immediately af
ter the negro's trial had ended and
the jury had returned a verdict of
guilty, giving him thc death penalty.
(Jet Mle Negro.
Some one not far from the negro
started the cry of "get the negro."
lt was taken up by all of those from
the part of the county where Mrs.
Fryar was killed, and Washington
was then seized and removed from
the court room. The crowd at first
seemed willing to hang the negro
from the suspension bridge, but a
suggestion that he ho burned on the
plaza met with Instant response and
he wits dragged to the city hall yard,
where the chain, already around his
neck, was thrown over the limb of a
tree, wood hastily secured and the
lire started.
After the verdict bad been return
ed Washington said in a half audi
ble whisper, "I'm sorry 1 done it."
The rush to secure the negro came
with such suddenness that o?leers,
lawyers and newspaper men were
3wept off their feet and the victim
was in the hands of the mob before
any one could stop the proceedings.
Dragged Through Street?.
While tho crowd that took Wash
ington from the court room is said
to have been composed of people
from the country, they were joined
by many citizens of Waco, and in
some instances, it is said, they left
their places of business to view the
burning of the negro. After the fire
had burned itself out, the body,
burned to a crisp, was viewed by a
coroner's jury.
Later in the day members of the
mob returned to the scene of the
burning, placed tho charred body in
a sack and dragged lt through the
principal streets 'behind an automo
bile, to Robinson, where Mrs. Pryar
was killed, and what remained of it
was suspended from a telephone pole
there.

On Wednesday of last week Reve
nue Ollleers King and Samuels, Spe
cial Officer A. T. Reid and Rural
Policemen Littleton and Thomas
raided up in the .locassee section,
but were totally unsuccessful so far
as wet goods were concerned. How
ever, they located, hidden behind a
large slump some ?100 yards from tho
road, a copper still, which was
promptly destroyed by being cut up
into shreds. Nothing doing in the
way of arrests.
The officers, however, ran into a
"live" plant on Thursday in the
Whitewater section, near the B. V.
Coward place. The still was located
on a small branch, and so far as thc
implements for mnking whiskey
were concerned, the plant had been
dismantled. There was on hand
ahout 200 gallons of mash and beer,
and this was destroyed. After a
long search through the woods the
officers finally found, hidden hore
and there in the forest, tho still, cap
and worm, each piece being bidden
in a different locality from the other.
In the matter of arrests the officers l
here, too, drew a blank.
Things picked up a bit in Seneca,
however, when Town Marshal Cor
bett, of Seneca. Rural Policeman
Thomas and Bud Hand, the latter
deputized to assist them, took tho
trail of an automobile that promised
something interesting. lt was 3.30
o'clock Sunday morning when the
whir of an automobile was heard by
the officers and the rattle of a wagon
a short distance in front of it was
heard by the automobile party. The
officers, realizing that they could not
catch the booze buggy, buzz wagon,
joy carl or whatever one chooses to
call lt, borrowed a one-horse wagon
from a blacksmith shop, and as the
auto neared the narrow section of
Hie street at the post office this
wagon was run out in front of the
speeding car, and tho driver thereof
found that he had to stop or smash
something. He preferred to stop.
There were ten occupants of the car,
as follows: B. Stephens, Claude
White, Pete White, -. -. Brown,
Bub QilStmp, - . -. Vinson, O. G.
Bugjuice. O. C. Lotgut, O. C. Tangle
foot and O. C. Bighead. The latter
four parties, you will note, possess
the same initials, and in each in
stance they stand for "One Gallon."
Bub Gilstrap, said to be the owner
of thc four O. C's, made his escape
in the general rounding up.
In tho hearing before the Mayor
of Seneca Monday B. Stephens, own
er and driver of the car, was fined
$2."), with a 30-day alternative, for
transporting liquor in tho night time.
Later he was taken bet?re Magistrate
J. N. Hopkins, where preliminary
hearing was waived. Magistrate
Hopkins, however, required a $400
1 bond from Stephens for the appear
ance at tho Sessions Court of himself
and his automobile-$200 per each.
The automobile was on its way
through the town of Seneca, on its
? way presumably to Newry. Stephens
! lives near Newry, and all of the other
. parties, we are informed, have been
in the Newry section for some time
! back.
So far as whiskey is concerned in
1 these parts, it seems that "sentiment
1 is ag'in it." And when sentiment is
that way, half the battle against li
quor is won. Violators can evade
' the law, they can evade the officers
' themselves, but they can't get around
"sentiment." Those nine letters
spell doom for the liquor seller.
Better quit, boys, "while the quit
tin's good."
When a man does anything he is
the least blt ashamed of, he attributes
lt to the human nature of his mnke
! up.

Columbia, May 13.-Tito Blens?
lologatcs in the State Convention will
meet in caucus in Columbia ou Tues
day night, preceding the Stnto Con
vention Tor (he purpose of selecting,
nominations tor tho various ofllcos to
be lilied by tho convontlon mid to
pass on the platform of their eandl
late for Governor. The name of Gen.
Wilie Jones, of Columbia, will bo
proposed for State chairman, and
candidates will also be presontod for
president and other positions which
will he Ulled.
This information was obtained hero
to-day front authoritative sources..
The caucus will be called at a desig
nated place and this faction will con
sider plans for the approaching cam
paign.
Among other nominations to bo
presented hy thia caucus lo tho con
vention will be the Democratic na
tional committeeman from this State
for the place now bold by United
States Senator B. It. Tillman, but.
they want HUIDO one whom they do
not consider partisan. Por the saino
reason they will present Gen. Wilie
Jones for Stnto chairman, as they do
not want John Gary Evans.
It is not likely that the Bleaso
men will make any nominations for
delegates to tho National Convention.
Seventy or Eighty.
Tito best information obtainable (a
that there aro between 70 and 80
Blouse delegates among tho member
ship of the State Convention. It ls
thought that Solicitor Cooper will
have about tho samo number, and if
this is the case the Manningites will
fall short of a Majority. However?
unothcr estimate gi vos Governor Man
ning ovor 200 of thc 338 delegates,
which would insure his control of
tho convention. If tho Cooper and
Bleaso delegations combined control
lhere mny bo some surprises in the
positions to be filled.
State Chairman John Gary Evans
will be nominated for re-election, and
so will Senator Tillman. When Gen.
Wilie Jones IB nominated against
Governor Evans and so m o man ia
placed in nomination then tho stand
of tho convention on the issues will
1)0 made known. Of course, if the
light is straight between Bleaso and
anti-Bloase, Hie latter will control.
Tho light on Senator Tillman and
State Chairman Evans will mnkc the
proceedings of tho convention inter
esting. Undoubtedly thc Bleaso fol
lowers will also oppose Representa
tive T. P. Cotbran and W. P. Pollock
for president of the convention. If
Manning does not have a majority
then tho Cooper contingent will de
cido the issue by whichever way they
vote.
Mcl/auiin'g Plan.
lt looks as if tho request of the
warehousemen for an hour to be al
lowed to Senator John L, McLaurin at
each of the campaign meetings is
doomed. Former Governor Cole Ii.
Mease stated to-day, In response to a
direct question, that he was opposed
to allowing any man to spenk who
was not a candidate, and he favored
this rule hoing followed strictly. He
did not call Senator McLaurin by
name, but stated emphatically that he
was opposod to any stich request, and
said his influence would 'be against lt.
If the BleaBO caucus goes against this
request from tho warehousemen
and that they will do so ls quito
likely-it is not thought there will
.be very much fighting over this
proposition in tho convention, which,
would mean that Senator McLaurin
would be forced to run for Lieuten
ant Governor if he wants to speak,
and would have only thc same timo
allowed the other Lieutenant Guber
natorial candidates. Former Gover
nor Blease said ir others than regu
lar candidates want to speak at tho
campaign meetings he didn't see why
tliey wouldn't do so before or after
the meetings were ovor.
Another interesting blt of infor
mation leaked out hore to-day re
garding thc recent caucus of the
warehousemen In the. State system,
which, lt will bo remembered, wn&
held behind closed doors. This waa
that the caucus stood: Manning, 50;
Blease, 13; Cooper, 4; neutral, 4.
It was stated that as between Man
ning and Blease the four neutral and
tho four Cooper would go to Bloase,
making .tho warehousemen stand,
for Manning 50, Blease 51-a ma
jority of ono for tho former Gover
nor. Thia poll was made by ono who
attended Hie conference.
