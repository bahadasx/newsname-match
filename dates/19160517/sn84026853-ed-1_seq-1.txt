PRELIMINARY HEARING FOL- f

LOWED BY TRIAL IN HIGH P
JUSTICE COURT. o

s
?
London, May 15.?Sir Roger CJase- i*
ment, the supposed head and prime
instigator of the Sinn Fein rebellion
in Ireland, was arraigned today in V
the Bow street police court and
charged with high treason.
The few spectators who were per-L
mited to enter the famous old police L
court were considerably surprised!
when a second prisoner was placed
beside Casement in the dock. This
man was Daniel Julian Bailey*, a private
soldier, whose home is at Womb- ?
ley, a village near London. Bailey
was arrested near Tralee, Ireland,
April 21. He was jointly charged,
with Casement, with high treason, but u
his exact connection with the Sinn |
* 1? ?* Koon made .
reiners nu? uv*. w ?
pUbliC. ig
In the formal charge, Casement is j
described as of no ocupation and no ^
s fixed abode. The charge against both a
, defendants reads: ?
The Charge. !j
"For that they did between the 1st s
day of November, 1914, and on divers ^
other occasions between that day and ^
the 21st day of April, 1916, unlawful
ly. maliciously and traitorously com-i
mit high treason within and without v
the realm of England in contempt of .
our sovereign lord, the king, and his
laws, to the evil example of other in n
like case and contrary to the duty I
and allegiance of the said defendants."
\
Casement is reported to have made
a long statement to the authorities,
and it is believed that this statement A
will considerably shorten the hearing
before the magistrate. The police
court hearing is merely a preliminary
to the real trial, which will take place
later before a panel of the judge of c
the high court of justice. |j

Washington, May 10.?Cotton is if

Soup Kitchens.
Berlin, May 12.? The portabl
ield kitchens which the soldiers cal
goulish cannon" are being introduc
d into the streets of the poorer sec
ions of Berlin, selling warm dinner
o all comers for 35 pfennings pe
ortion. The twon council of Litch
enberg, a big suburb to the north o
Berlin, was the first to adopt th
iea. Many of the working peopl
ave no time to cook for them
elves, and they can be far mor
heaply fed by cooking en mass
,t central points and distributing th'
ood through the field kitchens.
The basements of some big schoo
ouses have been fitted up as kitch
ins wherein huge boilers, each hold
ng over a hundred gallons, meat am
egetables by the wholesale are con
erted into palatable stew. The "gou
ash cannon" which haul the produc
hrough the streets for sale are eacl
irovided with a boiler under whic]
, low fire is kept burning.
The idea has become so popula
hat it is predicted that the "gou
ash cannon" will long survive th
far which popularized it.

BY GERMANY
Washington, May 12.?America's
ext step in the negotiations with
le Entente Allies regarding treatlent
of neutral commerce will be
elayed on acount of the implied
ireat contained in the German note
f May 5, in which the imperial govrnment
exprsesed confidence that in
iew of the new orders issued for
lbmarine warfare the United States
ould insist upon Great Britain ob;rving
the rules of international law
i dealing with trade ana reserving
oitself "complete liberty of decis>n"
unless this end was accomplishi.
It was stated authoritatively today
lat Germany's note had complicatdthe
situation, making it impossible
>r the United States to press its delands
upon the Allies at once with t
appearing to do so at the bidding

jquently it was uncertain when a

MEMORIAL DAY i
WAS FITTINGLY 1
OBSERVED HERE
Last Wednesday, May the 10th,
J AL1 Ml ir
wua uuaerveu 111 Aooeviue as memorial
Day and was one of the most pleasant
affairs of the kind held here in, ]
many years. The exercises of the '
day were held at eleven thirty in ,
the opera house and all the seats
were taken. The young people of
the high school were marched down
in a body and occupied the front
rows of seats. The boys of the high
school were in their uniforms and
made a very imposing appearance. .
All the survivors were on the 1
stage and the members of the local
chapter of the U. D. C.'s. The stage
was decorated in pot plants and
ferns and in Confederate flags as
drapery.
Gen. Bonham made an excellent
speech and pleased every one who
heard him. He emphasized the need f
of the preservation, of the history of 8
the war and the urgent need of the t
collection of historical data while *
there is yet some veteran to verify I
the truth of such history. He spoke J
of Abbeville's place in the picture, I
the flrst meeting of Secession being 8
held/here and -the last meeting: of t
the Confederate Cabinet being held t
here also. ; ;Gen. Bonham said that
Abbeville District had furnished g
about three thousand two hundred t
men to the conflict, which is: - more t
than the total voting strength of Ab- 1
beville county now.
General Bonham's speech was en- 1
joyed by all - and it was a pleasure I
to have him come back to nis . old s
home and among his many friends c
again. I
| . After the speaking the monument,?
was decorated by the children of the K
graded school, who sang several pat- ?
riotic songs, after which the veter- \v
ans were taken in charge, by the high *
school boys and escorted to thej
home of Dr. and Mrs. C. C. Gambrell I
where they were served with an ex-j?
cellent dinner. :
In the afternoon different commit- '1
tees from the local chapter went to t
the cemeteries and Crosses of Honor
were put up to the graves of the veterans.
At the Episcopal cemetery
twenty crosses were placed, at Long 1
Cane, ninety two, were placed and i
at Melrose three crosses were placed, jc
These crosses make a distinctive t
mark and present an imposing ap- 1
pearance. The chapter will put f
them at every veterans grave before
they give up the work. 1
The Second Primary, May 16.
Next Tuesday is the day for the
second primary, the candidates being c
W. H. Parks and L. S. Bradley for i
treasurer and P. J. Robinsin and C. (
W. Pennal for auditor, they being the i
four who rei jived the highest num-ji
ber of vdtea for the two offices. The i
six defeated candidates will with- ji
draw, and by next Tuesday night 1
their number will be increased bv
two more.
There were ten candidates for the
two places, and it was inevitable that
there must be some disappointments.
But there were as good men defeated
as those v/lio were elected, and at
some other time they may be the I
ones to head the ticket and forget I j
| their disappointment.?The McCor- .

Military Service For Women. ]
Munich, Germany, May a2.? The s
various problems of war, particular- I (
Hy as they affect women, has revived ^
| to an unprecendented degree in Ba- (
varia discussion as to the advisabil- j
jity and feasibility of the plant, first (
broacnea in tne nineties, 10 compel
women to undergo a sort of military j
serviec just as men do. Their service,
however, wolud consist mainly ^
of economic, household and nursing
duties.
There is unquestionably a large
number of people who have become
convinced that such a plan is highly
desirable, for they feel that this war
I has brought out the fact clearly that
jmuch good effort has gone to waste
through a lack of knowledge on the
part of women who nave willingly ;
tried to do something for their country,
and who could have been able
to render great services if they only
had known how.
