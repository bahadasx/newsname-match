JOHNSTON LETTER.
Memorial Day Observed. Cot
ton Burned. U. D.t C. ?Met.
Gov." Manning Visited ?
High School.
Throughout the south on last
Wednesday, May 10, flowers smiled
and flags fluttered afresh on the
graves of the men who fought and
died for principle, a principle which
they know they won, so there can
be no Lost Cause, as some maintain.
There is no day so dedicated to
'sentiment as this one,and sentiment,
is a great power, the spirit of the
day is a force which stimulates us
to discharge the duties we owe to
civilization. Each- year anew, Me
morial Day bids us consecrate our
selves to the fulfillment of the
charge our fathers laid upon us; it
bids us remember and resolve to
keep the faith which our fathers
died to prove. And so on this dav
the Mary Ann Buie chapter, Daugh
..ters of the Confederacy, met and
observed the day fittingly, and ap
propriate exercises were held in the
high school auditorium. The pupils
of the high school assembled at the
Confederate monument and gather
ing up the garlands marched to the
auditorium. The stage was attract
ive in many Confederate flags and
red and white flowers. After in
spiring songs and prayer Prof. W.
F. Scott introduced the speaker of
t the day, Dr. Pendleton Jones of
Edgefield, doiug this in a very hap
py manner. He said that when at
college he well recalled a Memorial
day exercise and the speaker, whose
words had so impressed him, and
this man was the father of the
speaker whom he knew would thrill
and interest the "audience also. Dr.
Jones' address was considered the
finest ever given on any such pre
vious occasion and he was listened
to with rapt attention. There were
points of history as told by him,
s^thAt_were exceedingly interesting.
When he concluded he was present
ed with a large basket of red and
white sweet peas, by Miss Jessie
Edwards, president of children's
chapter. After ?the roll call of the
departed veterans the garlands were
gathered up by the children and all
marched to Mt. of Olives cemetery
where the veterans graves were
decorated.
What might have resulted in a
most disastrous fire began here at
10:30 o'clock Wednesday morning,
caused from sparks of a shifting
freight. The freight depot and ware
house house occupy a central loca
tion on Main street and between the
two.was a large wooden platform
containing 150 bales of cotton. The
sparks ignited the cotton and owing
to the long drought it burned quick
ly. The town has no water works,
hence there was no other way to
extinguish the fire than to work by
hand and the men fought the fire
heroically, but soon used up the
emergency barrels of water, so a
water brigade was formed. The
hi^h school was dismissed for a
period and the boys all rushed to
the aid and assisted greatly. Thc
wooden freight depot was miracu
lously saved, but the brick ware
house was not in so much danger.
This contained hundred of bales of
cotton.
The last meeting of the W. C. T.
TT., was held with Mrs. M. A. Huiet
and during the business conducted
by the president, Mrs. T. R. Den
ny, several matters were discussed
and arranged for. The union will,
as in the past, co-operate with the
other unions of this vicinity in ob
serving Jennie Cassedy's birthday.
The annual visit will be made to
the County home with a picnic din
ner and a little play by eight girls
concerning flowers will be given for
"the benefit of tho inmates of the
home, this to be had in their chap
el. A committee was appointed for
the study manual on alcohol, this to
be taken up September 1st. The Y.
P. B. was discussed a?>;. it was
hoped that the organization would
Jbe revived and steps were to be tak
en to this effect. The subject for
the neeting waa "The mother's
meeting," and a special prayer was
made by Mrs. Olin Eidson for the
mothers, and blessings on the chil
dren, Mrs. M. A. Huiet read a
splendid paper, "A mother's oppor
tunity," and Miss Zena Payne also
read a paper, "When you open your
purse remember." Mrs. James White

Memorial Day Observed in
Ec?gefieM.
Through the efforts of the mem
bers of the Edgefield chapter, TJ.
D. C., Memorial day has been fit
tingly observed Wednesday, May
10. All of the Confederate veter
ans of the county were invited to
be guests of the chapter and din
ner was served in their honor in the
dining room of the Baptist church.
There were about 30 veterans pres
ent and they enjoyed the hospitality
of the patriotic women.
Immediately after the dinner was
served all | gathered about a plat
form that had been erected in the
cemetery near the monument to
the unknown Confederate dead.
A programme which had been
carefully arranged under the di
rection of Mrs. R. A. Marsh, the
president of the chapter, was car
ried oui.
After the singing of several pa
triotic selections the master of cere
monies, B. E. Nicholson, presented
Haddon Johnson, a young attorney
of the Aiken bar, as the orator of
the occasion. Mr. Johnson selec
ted as his subject "Jefferson Davis,
America's Man of Destiny." Mr.
Johnson reviewed the career of Mr.
Davis pointing out the fact that
historians had failed to give him
his rightful place in history. He
alone bore bravely and well the
responsibly of the government of
the new nation and that while he
was not as conspicuous as the Con
federate military leaders yet he is
entitled to more honor than he has
been accorded. Mr. Johnson is a
finished orator and his superb elo
quence held the close attention of
his hearers for nearly one hour.
A collection was taken for the
Shiloh monument fund. The chap
ter handed Mr. Johnson the amount
of expenses he insured in coming
to Edgefield and he very huriedly
donated the money to the Shiloh
monument fund.
At the close of the exercises the
gsaves'of the Confederate soldiers
in the cemetery and the monument
on the public square were deco
rated._
Death of Mrs. E. W. Samuel.
Mrs. E. W. Samuel died at her
home Wednesday morning. For
many months she has been in de
clining health. Some time ago she
was taken to a hospital in Augusta
for special treatment but failed to
be permanently relieved. About
a week ago she became much worse,
failing to respond to medical treat
ment. Mrs. Samuel was reared in
Key s ville, Ga., but came to Edge-]
field about 19 years ago to make j
her home, endearing herself to her
new friends. She was a member of
the Methodist church and a devouf
Christian woman. The funeral was
conducted from the Methodist
church Wednesday afternoon at 5
o'clock, the Rev. A. L. Gunter of
ficiating. The intermenttook place
in the village cemetery. Besides
her husband, Mrs. Samuel leaves a
son about 12 years of age and a
daughter eight years old.
Edgefield School Letter.

HARDY'S HAPPENINGS.
Unique Signs Over Door. Trip
to Augusta. Memorial Ser
vice at Sweetwater
Sunday.
Some one asked where Hardy's
was? Hardy's church is in the same
place it has been for nearly a hun
dred years, but this Hard v's moves
about all day and almost all night.
I often remind myself of the story
told of a card on a Dago's store.
"We never sleep." Next door on a
Chinaman's door another card ap
peared. "Me wakie too." So I am
wakie so much I feel as though I
never sleep.
Well as I said thi3 Hardy's moves
about. Went to Augusta last Wed
nesday to see the parade, but as it
was not to start until half past six
in the afternoon, I had to miss it
as that would have put me in the
night with three children all asleep,
and that would never do. Mr. Geo.
Wright and Mrs. McCartie carried
their children down and Btaid over
to see the parade and pronounced :
it fine. Thought ?ure I would see
the one on Friday but the hour ap- 1
pointed was too late. Really it 1
seems as though they want to bar '
the country people out by waiting 1
until so late in the afternoon to (
start. While on Broad street we 1
saw that gracious gentleman, Mr. K
Tom Rainsford and were sorry to ?
learn of his lovely lady's recent ill- 1
ness from grippe. Hope she may s
soon be over the effects of it. 1
It is useless for me to undertake
to say anything about the memorial j
services at Sweetwater. Mr. J. L.
Miras was there and can give a a
much better account of it than I ?
could. But then we each one have
our own view point of everything. ;^
MY, how we all enjoyed that day! ?
Meeting so many dear friends and Jj
remembering those who have gone
and been laid to rest out at the 1
Sweetwater cemetery. There were 8
people there from far and near. The c
governor from Columbia, Mr. Jim 1
Horn and wife from Ridge Spring, 1
Misses Mundy came with them from r
a visit to Mr. and Mrs. Horn. They
were going home with Mr. and
Mrs. John Mundy. Miss Sallie v
Hammond from Augusta, whom we ?
ali love to have with us for she is 1
a dear, sweet jolly soul. Miss May
Roper of North Augusta, these two 1
sweet girls came with their cousins 6
Mr. Willie and Miss Lucile Burk- \
halter. Several from Augusta, Ga., '
and North Augusta. Trenton was c
represented by Mrs. Dorian Swear- j
ingen and family, Mrs. Roper Day, ,
Mrs. Claud Wertz from Columbia, 1
Messrs. J. L. Miras, Orlando Shep- 1
parcl and B. E. Nicholson and many (
otheis from Edgefield. Mr. and Mrs.
Sam Adams, Mrs. Laura Bunoh and '
Mrs. Lona Bunch came down from (
Clark's Hill. All of tthese dear peo- '
pie we were so glad to see and have j
with us. And speaking of Clark's '
Hill brings back the delightful time
we enjoyed with those hospitable '
people last August at the W. M. 1
U. which also brings to mind our 1
beloved treasurer, ?Mrs. Fannie ,
Tompkins. We were so shock- 1
ed and grieved to learn of her sad 1
death, last Wednesday. She was 1
such a such a sweet, retiring lady.
Her timidity impressed me very '
much. Sorry to learn of Mrs. '
Samuel's death also.
Returning to the subject of
Sweetwater memorial day. It was
quite touching when Mr. John
Mathis was presented with three
chairs as the oldest deacon and for
his helpfulness in every way, with
things pertaining to church. He is
a noble old gentleman, who is far
down the hill of life, yet always
cheerful.
We were sorry to hear of Mrs.
Theresa Adams' indisposition. Hope
she may soon be stronger, also Mrs.
Sallie Bxinsh being too feeble to
attend the services. ShealwayB loved
to be at such places and she was
very much disappointed to have to
give it up when the day came. Hope
when it rains she may feel better.

Cloded a Satisfactory Session
With Picnic. Governor
^Manning and Others
Delivered Addresses.
m --:
Friday last was a Red Letter Day
for Eed Hill. The picnic given at
fhe $ose of the close of the school
enabled a great throng to come to
gether for a day of unusual pleasure
under the best possible influences
Theroodern and commodious, two
story.'school building which has
beerierected at Red Hill is a credit
to the community. All honor to a
people who have accomplished what
the good people of Red Hill have.
In many respects it is an ideal com
munity. They have a large well
equipped lodge hall in which the
ivJasona and Woodmen hold their
regular meetings. The church is
one of the largest in the county.
The pastor occupies "Rose Cottage"
over on the bill, but little more
than a stone's throw from the
jhurch. Not far away is the store
of Mr. Ernest Quarles which ena
bles the people to supply their
leeds practically at home.
The attendance was very large,
ihere being probably 1,500 people
ireeent. The announcement that
JO vernor Richard I. Manning
ivould be present and deliver an ad
Iress had much to do with the large
ittendance. . The people first as
lembled in the school auditorium
>ut as this could not accommodate
nore than one-third of the people
di repaired to the large church
lear by.
The first speaker was County Su
>erindent of Education W. W. Pal
er who has rendered great assist
ance to the Red Hill peonle in all
hey have undertaken for the up
milding of their school. In pre-1 ]
en ting him to the audience, Rev.
r. T. Littlejohn thanked him for
lia un-^jing efforts in behalf of the j 1
^d'?iir-bChocl. : Mr. .-fuller cornel 1
nended the people of this progres
ivo community upon the erection
>f the modern school building, sta
ing that it is a wise investment i
hat will bring large returns for i
nany years to come.
The second speaker was County
Demonstration Agent P. N. Lott I j
vho spoke briefly of the importance 11
?f soil building through the legum
nous crops. He stated that nature
las provided 1,000 plants that ex-1 <
ract nitrogen, the most expensive | <
dement of plant food, from the
ttmosphere and store it in the soil.
>lr. Lott said a heavy sod of burr j ^
dover or vetch turned under was
?qual to GOO pounds of nitrogen.
Dwing to the limited time allotted
Vir. Lott, he could only '"'touch the
ligh places" of his work in the
jounty.
The noxt and eclipsing address cf
;he occasion was delivered by Gov
ernor Richard I. Manning, who ap
peared at his best Friday. Gover
nor Manning selected education as
ms theme for this occasion, and
svhile it was an old subject he treat
?d it in such a practical way as to
make every statement of intense in
terest to the large audience.
Governor Manning stressed the
importance of educating our entire
citizenship because each man is a
sovereign. His vote determines
who shall fill public office and each
one has a part in fixing the policy
of the government. The hope of
the State depends upon the wiping
out of illiterary. He spoke of the
success of the night schools in Green
ville county in whieh 1,000 pupils,
practically all adults, are enrolled.
He referred to the increasing
wealth of the people of the State,
citing government figures to show
that within the past decade farm
product? have so increased in value
as to raise South Carolina from the
24th to the 13th State in the value
of farm produce. "
Governor Manning paid a beauti
ful tribute to the school teachers of
South Carolina and referred to the
act introduced at the last session of
the legislature looking to a higher
standard among teachers, stating
that counties which complied with
the provisions of the act could ar
range for a special course for teach
ers of the high school. He also re
ferred to the act which provi les for
the consolidation of schools and
thc employment of a teacher of ag
riculture. The Torrens system,
Governor Manning said, is the first
step to rural credit which will pre

Lott School Closed Profitable
Session.
Located on an eminence overlook
ing the old homestead of the la
mented Dr. W. H. Timmerman,
which yet remains in the family,
stands the Lott school building. It
is in the centre of a well-nigh ideal
rural community. Probably no
where in the county will one find a
more densely populated section. We
mean one that is composed of a
greater number of small, thrifty
farmers. Standing upon the porch
of the school building, one can
count nearly a dozen farm houses
that are well-p?inted and attractive
ly environed. And then advanc
ing to the limit of your circle of
vision you can count probably near
ly another dozen of these attractive
homes that lie beyond.
From these homes during the past
session 75 bright and very promis
ing children gathered in the Lott
school every morning. They possess
normal minds and robust bodies,
bodies made strong by outdoor ex
ercise and the wholesome, home
grown food, the kind that requires
no pure-food-law guarantee. (Of
this fact we had tangible evidence 1
at the dinner hour.)
These bright sweet children have j
been taught for several years by two
is good teachers as can be found in
wy rural school in the state. We j
refer to Prof. Wise and Miss Daisy ^
Lyon, both Edgefisld county prod- j
nets, no other hall-mark than
"Edgefield" being needed to estab
lish their sterling worth. These two j
educators have pleased pupils, pa- (
irons and people so weil that they
ire being urged to accept the school j
mother term. Their decisions have
sot yet been announced.
The picnic which was given by j
ihe patrons jf the school Saturday j
proved to be an oasis for the chil- ?
Iren, an opportunity for the politi- f
nans, an outing for the newspaper \
"oik and a day of all-round.pleasure t
:or the ??eighborhood. Soon after -\
me people arrived Mr. P. N. Lott, B
leting as master of ceremonies, in- \
;roduced some of the candidates \
Tom the porch of the school build- r
ng. The following made brief j
speeches: J. W. Cox, a candidate ?
"or solicitor, B. E. Nicholson and ^
M. P. Wells, candidates for the
lenate, and Mr. J. L. Walker, a 6
?andidate for re-election to the ^
aouse. Capt. N. G. Evans was pres- t
mt and also responded to the re- j
luest to speak. ,
These orations were followed by 1
kvhat was easily the most pleasing <
feature of the day-the feast that !
was spread down under the oaks, i
The good women of this communi- |
ty, with the aid of the men. who l
are evidently good providers, served <
a dinner fit for kings. We have not |
seen such a dinner before in a long
while. After every appetite was ?
satisfied more was restored to the ?
baskets, uncarved and untouched, I
than was consumed.
After dinner the people gathered I
in small gioups under the trees and
engaged in pleasant conversation.
Surely it is wholesome and helpful
for a community to come together
annually in this manner. It renews
old ties of friendship and forms new
ones as well. We raise our hat very
high to the patrons of the Lott
school and to the good people of
the community.

MEMORIAL SERVICE.
Second Annual Memorial Ser
vice Held at Sweetwater
Church. Governor Man
ning Spoke.
Encouraged by the success of the
beautiful memorial service of a year
ago and the good results atttibuta
ble to that occasion, Rev. E. W.
Reynolds, the zealous pastor, and
his loyal co-workers of Sweetwater
church arranged for a second me
morial service, which was held last
Sunday. As positive pioof that the
memorial of 1915 met with the
hearty approval of the people of the
Sweetwater and adjacent commu
nities, the attendance was almost
double that of last year.
On Saturday^he members of the
cemetery association and others
who have loved ones buried in thia
hallowed enclosure came together
and placed flowers upon the graves
and otherwise improved the appear
ance of God's acre. As we walked
through the cemetery, reading the
well-deserved epitaphs of choice
spirits who in the past were dyna
mic forces in vitalizing and ener
gizing the Sweetwater and adjoin
ing communities we observed that
many marble slabs and granite
shafts bore names that deserve to
oe written high on the pages of the
.eligious and secular history of
Edgefield county.
Early in the forenoon the people
gathered from far and near, appar
ently vying with each other in their
?agemess to meet and greet Gov
ernor Manning, who accepted an
nvitation from the pastor to be
cresent and deliver an address.
rVbout ll o'clock all assembled in
;he church which was by this time
practically filled. Mr. Reynolds
mnounced that, owing to the en
orced departure of Gov. Manning
>y noon, the order of exercise had
o be reversed. Departing from the_
?8ual~?rderor"c?Btom,"that of re-"
lerving the best for the last, the
>est, the governor's address, had to
>e given first place. He thereupon
equested Hon. B. E. Nicholson to
ntroduce the governor, which he
lid with characteristic ease and
rrace.
Governor Manning gave expres
lion to his appreciation of the in
vitation to meet with the people of
his historic old church, stating that
t carried him back to the time
ivhen, as a boy reared in the coun
try, he rode seven miles to cnurch
jvery Sunday. He spoke at some
length of the fundamental law
which defines our duty to God and
to our neighbor. He referred to
ihe remarkable change of public
sentiment in every State, and
particularly with reference to liquor.
Within the past few months he has
ittended banquets in Greenville
and Charleston and no intoxicating
liquors of any kind were served.
He stated that there are many man
ifestations that our people are im
proving. He commended the ef
forts of those who are behind the
movement to erect a woman's build
ing in Columbia which is to be a
home for youug women who fill
various positions and would with
out such a home be forced to live
in boarding houses subject to many
temptations.
Gov. Manning said the problem
of education is the problem of the
betterment of the race. He advo
cated vocational training in order to
make our citizens more efficient.
He deplored the fact that there is
prevalent a tendency to break up
home-life. His admirable address
was altogether suited to a church
assemblage and was well received.
Immeiiately after closing his ad
dress Governor Manning motored
to Warrenville to catch the "Au
gusta Special" for Columbia in or
der to fill another engagement late
in the afternoon.
Following the custom established
last year, a collection was taken for
the memorial fund, which amounted
to ?20.00.
A very beautiful feature of the
morning was the presentation of
three massive mahogany chairs to
Deacon John Mathews as an expres
sion of appreciation of the faithful
service which he has rendered the
church and community throughout
hib long life. He is now 82 years
of age, and has been a deacon of
the church for 50 years. The chairs
are to remain in the church as a
