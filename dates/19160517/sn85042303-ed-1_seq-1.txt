TELEPHONE
QUESTION IS
DP Ml
NEW PROPOSITION WHICH THE
COMPANY 13 ASKING FOR WAS
DISCUSSED BY THE BUSINESS
MEN THIS MORNING.
The mayor and members of the
Business Men's association met at the
rooms of the Chamber of Commerce
this morning for, the purpose of dis
cussing the local telephone situation
and to take some action for the bet
terment of the service.
The Pioneer Telephone company
has recently made repairs on the
lines in this city, but there is con
stant complaint against the service
rendered the patrons. The officers
of the company state that the present
building is inadequate for the com
pany's needs, and that the switch
board is not large enough to handle
the business. The company agrees,
howevere, to erect a building and
install equipment costing approxi
mately $100,000, under certain condi
tions, which follow:
The company agrees to erect this
building and enlarge the plant if the
present patrons will sign an agree
ment allowing the company to elimi
nate the ten per cent discount now
allowed customers when bills are
paid before the tenth of each month.
For the purpose of getting the senti
ment of the people, a subscription
list was started by two members of
the Pioneer Telephone company this
morning, and it is reported that they
succeeded in securing some signers
before the meeting of the business
men was called to check this.
Mayor Mullen stated that if the
equipment of the telephone company
is inadequate to the needs of the city,
the corporation commission could
and would compel it to install same
without any such sacrifice as the
company asks in its petition. The
mayor recited several facts In con
nection with his visit to the cor
poration commission on this matter,
and stated that if the business men
of the city will stand behind him he
will compel the Pioneer Telephone
company to give the city adequate
service. A committee, consisting of
J. W". Krueger, Malone Lykins, and
Mr. Levy was selected to meet with
the mayor and board of commission
ers this afternoon at three o'clock and
to invite the representatives of the
company to be present, that the mat
ter may be thoroughly discussed.
At the meeting this morning, the
question of service was freely dis
cussed, and the concensus of opinion
was that the coming is now getting
all that is coming to it. The action
taken at the meeting this afternoon
will probably determine the action
of the mayor and board of city com
missioners with reference to the tele
phone question in the future.
Farmers from this section are com
plaining over the cool weather which
has prevailed here for some time. The
crops are seriously retarded cn this
account.

ILL NOT COME
TO JURE
LACK OF HOTEL FACILITIES COST
THE CITY THREE CONVENTIONS
DURING PAST TEN DAYS
OTHERS MAY REFUSE.
Within the past few days Ardmore
has lost the chance of getting three
different conventions on account of
the present hotel facilities. The la
test that refused to come here, but
went to Knid instead, was the state
convention of the Christian church,
which recently dosed a convention
at riaremore. When invited by dele
gales from this city to convene in
Ardmore next year, they were in
formed that the convention could not
consider such u proposition until Ard
more had hotels enough to house the
delegates when they surived.
The grand lodge Knights of Pythias
will also convene at Knid next year.
Practically the same reply was given
the local delegates when they in
vited the grand ledge to come here
as was given the Christian church
delegation, Ardmore, in Myrtle lodge
Knights cf Pythias, has the largest
lodge in the state in point of num
bers, and is adequately able to enter
tain the. grand lodge, but the hotel
question loomed up again and the
Io;lge will convene at Enid in 1917.
The Bill Posters' association of Ok
lahoma recently closed a convention
at Tulsa. W. U. llurnitt of this city
was instructed by the business men's
association and the 'Chamber of Com
merce to invite them to come here
another year. The invitation was de
clined for the same reasons set forth
above, and the next annual meeting
will be held at Oklahoma City.
The druggists of the state are now
in session at Sulphur, and an invita
tion will be extended them to meet
here next year, but the secretary
of the Chamber of Commerce and the
secretary of the Business Men's asso
elation have little hope that the in
vitation will bo accepted, on account
of the lack of hotel facilities.
"The greatest need of Ardmore at
the present time," said a prominent
business man this morning, "is a good
hotel, modern and up-to-date, large
enough to take care of any state con
vention which desires to come here,
and until that is accomplished Ard
more need not look for very much in
the way of conventions."
The above is the sentiment of ev
ery citizen who hopes to see Ar.d
morc have a modern hotel within
the next year.
DOCTOR WILLIAMS' SERMON ON
TUESDAY NIGHT WAS BASED ON
CHRIST'S MIRACLE OF HEALING
THE GADARENE DEMONIAC.
Dr. Williams preached on booze last
night. His address was based on
Christ's miracle of healing the Gada
rene demoniac. The announced theme
of his address was: "Devils, Men, and
Hogs." Hie said the scripture from
which his text was taken, was one of
the strangest in all the Bible, that it
contained something (of nearly u
erything. No other explanation can
be given of the strange, unnatural,
wicked, inhuman conduct of people
than that they were taken possession
of by the devil. He sometimes owns
people, and uses all the powers God
has given them. Mary Magdalene had
seven devils of seven different varie
ties That is bad enough to be sure.
But the Bible tells us of a man who
had a legion of them. Christ has
power to cast out all kinds of devils.
In the text the devils used the man's

NO MORE FREE PAPERS
A great many people do not
consider that they are asking
anything unreasonable when
they call at the Ardmorelte of
fice and request the gift of a
paper. It would not be if we
were only required to give the
one paper, but that is not the
case. There is not a day that
passes but we are asked for
extra papers for one reason or
another and every day from
five to twenty-five papers are
passed out for which there is
no return. The price of paper
on which the Ardmorelte i3
printed costs now double what
it has cost heretofore, and we
are compelled to cut off every
item of waste that exists. Here
after every paper that goes out
of the Ardmoreite office will be
charged for. Do not feel hurt
if you are asked for the price of
the paper, should you neglect to
tender the price.

BEGINS TO LOOK AS IF LOCAL
CAPITALISTS WILL BUILD HO
TEL SEVERAL ARE AMPLY
ABLE.
According to reports from the sec
retary of the Business Men's associa
tion and the Chamber of Commerce,
the answer of Mr. Sharp in response
to a telegram sent him several days
ago, relative to his intention in re
gard to building a hotel, was not very
favorable, inasmuch as he practically
states that he is out of the deal alto
gether. Mr. Sharp indulged in some very
plain remarks about the manner in
which affairs have been conducted
relative to his proposition, but the
business men, on the other hand,
think that he "has no kick coming,"
since he was assured that he would
he given every consideration possible.
Some time ago Mr. Sharp sent has
representative before the Hoard tf
County Commission! rs asking that
certain tax penalties be set aside.
These penalties were against the pro
posed hotel site, but the Board of
County Commissioners refused to do
this, stating that Mr. Sharp was as
able to pay as well as some who are
not as well fixed, anil for the further
fact that the board did not wish to
establish a precedent of remitting
paling tax penalties every time it
was asked..
It has been reported, however, that
several property owners In the imme
diate vicinity of the proposed site of
fered to pay the delinquent tax if he
would go on with the hotel. The
matter has been allowed to languish,
f.owever, and there is little chance
that, the Sharp proposition will ma
terialize. Ardmore is going to have a hotel
within the coming year, according to
the statement of both business organ
izations, and the chances are that it
will be built with local capital. Every
encouragement, is being given local
capitalists to invest here, and there
Is a growing feeling that Ardmore
has enough capital to build anything
necessary, without asking outsiders
lo come, and then raise a heavy bo
nus for them.
At the booster meeting soon to be
held in this city it is expected that
some interesting developments will
be revealed to the general public
for the best interests of the city.

AFTER BUSINESS TRIP TO TEXAS
POINTS, MAYOR IS BACK AT HIS
DESK IN CITY HALL ISSUES

After a business trip of several
days to Texas cities. Mayor Mullen is
back at his desk in the city hall,
and was engrossed In public busi
ness this morning when asked what
steps he was going to take to revive
Interest in baseball in this city. The
mayor stated that he was going to
issue a call for a meeting to be held
at the Chamber of Commerce rooms
tomorrow night at eight o'clock, at
which time it will be determined
whether Ardmore will continue la the
league or drop out. Marietta, Madill
and Ringling are the only ones re
maining at present, but if Ardmore
drops out another town will be sup-!
plied to complete the four-team cir
cuit. In that event, Mannsvllle, Tish
onungo, and possibly Milburn have
been suggested to supply the fourth
place. Mayor Mullen is confident
that the fans will be in favor of re
maining in the league after the mat
ter is thoroughly talked over tomor

TRACTION COMPANY GETS PER
MISSION TO USE CITY WATER
IN ERECTING AND SUPPLYING
BUILDINGS.
At the meeting of the city commis
sioners last night, permission was
granted I. M. Putnam, who repre
sented the newly organized traction
company to connect water mains
with the city stand pipe north of the
city limits. The company is prepar
ing to build large car barns and
shops just north of where the old one
stood, and they will require a large
amount of water, both for doing the
work and to supply tho buildings af
ter they have been complete.
The traction company in Us peti
tion to the city commissioners, stated
that it would Install all of the equip
ment and pay for the water at regu
lar rates.
The newly organized company evi
dently intends to put the line Into
operation as speedily as possible, and
during the course of his remarks
Monday night at the business men's
meeting, Mr. Putnam stated that the
lines would be extended as soon as
the business warranted it. This was
interpreted to mean that the com
pany would eventually extend the
line to the fourth ward, past the
Whittington park and on to the ceme
tery. This has been talked of many
times in the past and at one time
the citizens of the fourth ward of
fered a substantial bonus for the
line to be so extended.-
The new company Is composed of
men who are financially able to put
over any deal they deem necessary,
and the citizens are anxiously await
ing the time when the lines will ba
in operation all over the city.
