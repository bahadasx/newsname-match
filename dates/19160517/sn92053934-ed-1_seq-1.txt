Note of Pope
Is Answered
hy President
Washington, May 17. President
Wilson has replied to the message
sent him recently by Tope Benedict in
which the pope expressed the earnest
hope that war between the United
States and Germany would not be pre
cipitated by the submarine issue and
conveyed the impression that he hoped
the United States might be of assist
ance ultimately in restoring peace io
Europe. The reply of the president
was conwyed through Monsignor
Borizano, the apostolic delegate here,
who delivered the pope's message to
the White house.
White house officials refused today
to discuss the pope's message or the
reply of the president, but in other
quarters it was indicated definitely
that the exchange of messages had
only remotely to do with the question
of peace in Europe.
The president is understood to have
informed the pope that he was very
eager to keep the United States out of
the war and would do everything
possible consistent with maintaining
the honor and rights of the United
States. Neither message will be made
public
At the White house today it was
said that nothing was known of the
mission to this country of Secretary
Grew of the American embassy in Ber
lin, who is now on his way to the
United States. It has been suggested
that possibly he might be bringing a
message from Emperor William to
President Wilson.

AMERICAN IS
TAKEN FROM
BANDITGANG
Storekeeper Captured by
Mexicans in Raid Is Re
claimed by Troopers.
OUTLAWS ARE ROUTED
J. Deemer and Negro Cook
Being Brought, Back to
U. S., Says Report.
Marathon, Texas May 17.
Cnited States soldiers haTe res
cued J. Deemer, American store
keeper captured by Mexican raid
ers on Glenn Springs and Boquil
las Texas, according to a man
named Terry who arrived this
morning.
He said tbe soldiers entered a
village 12." miles in .Mexico and
the bandits rushed ont, leaving
Deemer and a captive negro nam
ed Monroe Payne. Payne and
Deemer are being brought back
to the United States, Terry said.
A track driver arriving here today
from Boquillas said that it was re
ported on the border that Major
Langhorne and two troops of eaT
airy had surronnded the Big Bend
bandit raiders about 125 miles
from the border, killing six and
capturing .". Army officers here
have made no announcement re
garding such an engagement.
According to the truck driver's re
port the bandits were surrounded
and did not put up a tight. The
Americans ceased tiring at once.
The I't captured, it was said, wore
to be brought here for trial.
San Antonio, Texas, May 17. The
rescue by the American soldiers of J.
Deemer and the negro cook, Monroe
Payne, carried off as prisoners by the
bandits that raided Glenn Springs and
Boouillas, was reported to General
Funston today.
Their rescue alive was due to the
refusal of the residents of the build
ing where they had been left to carry
out the orders of the bandits to kill
them if the American troops attempted
their rescue.
Langhornes Men Heroes
The report came from Colonel Fred
erick Sibley who received his informa
tion from Major Langhorne, now
about one hundred miles south of the
border. A detachment of Major Lang-
horne's force found the Americans at I
El Pino, 90 miles south of Boquillas,
early yesterday morning. The Amer
icans had been left there by their cap
tors in charge of the residents. None
but the unarmed inhabitants of the
town was there when the soldiers ar
rived and no resistance was made.
Major Langhorne reported to Col
onel Sibley that he was pushing for
ward and hoped io overtake the
bandits during the day. He added that
no federal troops had been encount
ered and that the attitude of the resi
dents through which he had passed
appeared friendly.
Washington, May 17. Genuine re
lief over the Mexican situation was
evident in administration circles to
day. The principal cause was the as
surance conveyed to President Wilson
and his cabinet yesterday through Sec
retary Baker that the Carranza gov
ernment now is convinced the United
States has no intention of interven
ing in Mexican politics and that con-
fsequently resentment against the
punitive expedition is rapidly de
creasing. Promises Are .Hade
General Scott, chief of staff of the
army, brought this word to Secretary
Baker from bis conference at El Paso
with General Obregon, war minister
for the Carranza government Among
the promises made by General Obre
gon with the approval of General Car
ranza, at the conclusion of the con
ference were these: Ten thousand
selected Mexican troops were to pa
trol the territory about Parral, the
southernmost locality from which the
American troops are being withdrawn,
and to search diligently for Villa or
his bandits.
A strong Mexican force m to try to
capture the Glenn Springs and Boquil
las raiders in the Big Bend district and
to liberate Deemer, the American
storekeeper, carried off by the bandits.
No Mexican troops were to be moved
from Sonora state through Pulpit Pass
to the rear of General Pershing's
column.
General Scott's part of the informal
pact did not include any promises of
American troop withdrawal at a defin
ite time.
General Soott expressed the opinion
that General Carranza and his war
minister have ordered speedy troop
movements in an attempt to carry out
their pledges.
The briefest report of the fight was
that brought back to the advanced
base by Sergeant Chicken, the oldest
of the 20 Apache Indian scouts. No
one with this expedition seems to
know Sergeant Chicken's age, which
is estimated variously at from 70 to
90. lie was in the van during the
pistol battle, where his experiences
were said to be thrilling enough to

CASEMENT IS
DUE TO FACE
HIGHER TRIAL
Sir Roger and Bailey Sub
mitted Today at Hearing
for High Treason.
London, May lTV-Sfi Roger
Casement and DaniePSRailey were
committed for trial today for high
treason.
When the case was reopened to
day Constable Carter of the Koyal
Irish constabulary was recalled
for cross examination.
Carter said he had not heard Bailey
say after his arrest he had a statement
for the authorities but at another time
he did hear Bailey say: "I have im
portant information which will give
you police something to do."
A Russian colonel, Nicholas Belaiew,
who is in this country on special work
for his government, identified the rifle
produced in court yesterday, which
was taken by a diver from the wreck
of the German steamship Aud, as one
made in the Russian Poula works in
1915.
The prosecution then called Lieuten
ant Colonel Gordon, who testified that
the map which Casement and his com
panions brought from Germany and
buried in the sand was similar to those
made by the German war staff.
This decision was reached at the
conclusion of the preliminary hearing
of these men on the charge of partici
pation in the Irish rebellion, which has
been in progress since Monday. The
date of the trial and the court before
which it will be held have not yet been
announced.
BERLIN TALKS OF
BRITISH SPEECH
Tenton 5evrspapers Declare Sir Ed
ward Grey Merely Repeated Words
of the German Chancellor.
Berlin, May 17 (by wireless to Say
ville.) "German newspapers discuss
at length the statements attributed to
the British foreign secretary, Sir Ed
ward Grey, in the recent interview in
which he took up the origin and ob
ject of the war," says the Overseas
News Agency.
The newspapers agree that Sir
Edward merely repeated statements
already refuted by Chancellor Yon
Bethmann-Hollweg, who in his speech
of Aug. 19, 1915, discussed Premier
Asourtli's utterances on the same
topics. The premier then stated that
Germany had made impossible an un
derstanding with Great Britain in the
negotiations before the war by ask
ing Great Britain to pledge her abso
lute neutrality in the event Germany
became engaged in war.
The chancellor pointed out how
ever, that Germany had asked assur
ances of Great Britain's neutrality in
case war should be forced upon Ger
many, which is quite a different thing
inasmuch as it excluded the possibil
ity that Great Britain would be forced
to remain neutral if Germany should
entertain intentions of aggressive ac
tion. Red Men Adjourn Meeting.
Springfield, 111., May 17. The great
council, Improved Order of Red Men
of Illinois, and Daughters of Poca
hontas, will adjourn their 39th annual

GIVE PRESIDENT
SOLID SUPPORT
Democrats of Michigan Staunchly Back
Benomination of Wilson
Lauded by Speaker.
Lansing, Mich., May 17. Democrats
of Michigan, solidly supporting the re
nomination of President Wrilson, met
in state convention here today. Each
of the 13 state districts will elect two
delegates and two alternates to the
national convention. Four delegates
at large and four alternates also will
be named.
Lauding President Wilson as the
man "who with infinite patience, quiet
courage and masterly ability, and with
out the sacrifice of national honor, has
successfully guided his country
through storm and danger," Congress
man Frank E. Doremus of Detroit as
temporary chairman, addressed the
convention.
Referring to President Wilson's ef
forts to preserve peace, the speaker
said:
"He who insists upon a strict adher
ence to the principles of international
law seeks to avoid the causes of war
and becomes the true friend of peace.
Such a friend of peace is Woodrow
Wilson, who for nearly two years,
through the shifting winds of circum
stances and the cross currents of vitu
perative criticism has sought to keep
our ship of state with its 100,000,000
passengers off the cruel rocks of war.
"True there has been more or less
mutiny on board, but much of this has
come from a few passengers, who,
through political misfortune, were not
captains themselves or members of the
crew.
TAKE PRECAUTIONS
TO HALT VIOLENCE
Chicago, May 17. Special precau
tions have been taken by the police in
anticipation of further violence in con
nection with the strike of the 700 ex
press wagon drivers who stopped work
yesterday. One man was probably fa
tally injured and several arrests were
made on the first day of the strike,
when the drivers who had walked out
picketed the streets surrounding the
depots and express stations and at
tempted to stop all deliveries of ex
press. Bricks were hurled at two wag
ons as they were leaving an express
station and a number of other wagons
were turned back and not allowed to
deliver their loads. No wagons oper
ated in the residence section of the
city and but little business was moved
in the downtown section.
The principal demand of the strikers
is that their union be recognized and
this demand has met with refusal on
the part of the managers of at least
two of the largest concerns affected,
who said they would till the positions
of the strikers today with non-union
men. The men are also asking shorter
hours and the hearing of grievances,
although no formal demand has yet

ARMY BILL IS
AGAIN UNDER
SENATE FIRE
Discussion of Nitrate Plant
Leads to a Fight for
Force Reduction.
Washington, May 17. Attacks
on the provision for a government
nitrate plant incorporated in the
army bill delayed adoption of the
conferees report today in the sen
ate. Senator Hardwick of Georgia
led in the attack characterizing
the provision as dangerous social
istic and paternal.
The debate was broadened out by
Senator Lodge denouncing the reduc
tion in the senate provision for the
size of the regular army in order to
put $20,000,000 into a nitrate plant at
Muscle Shoals or some other place.
Senator Newlands suggested the ad
visability of refusing to accept the
conference report
Senator Smith of Michigan declared
a current report that the war depart
ment had advance information of the
raid at Columbus, N. M., and had not
taken proper steps to prevent it should
be investigated. Senator Fall endorsed
this.

another veniremen summoned in the
trial of Will H. Orpet, the college boy
accused of murdering Marian Lam
bert, the girl who loved him, today de

fairly.
Orpet sat beside his parents as he
did the first and second day of the
trial and paid close attention to the
answers of the prospective jurors.
"Iv'e got an opinion. I can't be a
fair juror," replied venireman after
venireman.
Judge C. H. Donnelly of the adjoin
ing county of Mcllcnry, who is presid
ing the the trial, pointed out to the
men in the jury box that to seek re
lief from jury service by giving a
trivial opinion as an excuse was dis
honest. Former Iowa Congressman Dead.
Clarion, Iowa, May 17. Heart dis

Boston, May 17. The probable loss
of eight men from the United States
cruiser San Francisco, after the
cruiser ran aground on Great Round
Shoal in Vineyard Sound early today,
was reported by wireless here. A gale
was blowing, the advices said. The
battleship New Hampshire, the coast
guard cutters Acushnet and the Gres
ham and the submarine tender Mel
ville were ordered to her assistance
from various points on the coast

that the San Francisco had worked
herself free of the shoals. Naval offi
cials here however state they had no
word to this effect The San Francisco
was officially reported afloat and only
slightly damaged in a message received
at the Charlestown navy yard at 10:40

ship, was aground on a shoal in Nan
tucket Sound for several hours early
today in a gale, during which it was
reported she lost a whale boat contain
ing eight members of ner crew. The
fate of the men has not' yet been
learned. The San Francisco floated
later without assistance and was not
greatly damaged. Observation from
the cruiser was impossible because of
the rain.
Messages saying eight men were lost
were received at two stations but of
ficers of the Charlestown navy yard
which was in touch with the cruiser
most of the time she was aground said
they had no word that any men were
missing.
The exact place where the San
Francisco stranded is in doubt Com
mander Belknap gave her position as
latitude 41.22 north, longitude 69.48.
This would place the cruiser off thb
Old South Shoal. Another meesag
from the cruiser said she had ground
