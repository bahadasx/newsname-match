Tells of Driving Captive.
The star witness from the standpoint
of human Interest was Martin Collins, a
farmer's lad of 12 years, who Was
called to identify Casement as one of
the men arr^ste^ nefcr Tralee. Martin
told with evident!'pride how he liad
driven Cas^nent and- a constable for
several. miles when the prisoner was
being taken to, headquarters. Much or
the time he was testifying the boy kept
his eyes on Casement, and there Was
no hesitation on his part as he de
clared the man in the dock was the
one -he had driven in his cart.
After the hearing had been in" pro
gress Tor 'some time Casement turned
his attention from the testimony to the'
writing of a lon£ statement. While thus
fngaged, he showed marked'.emotion
for the first tyme since tlie hearing' be
saf. Whatever was the nature of his
tiy/ughts, the^were such that. they
moved him to tears. He wept quietly
as he worked away with ifls pencil. It
was a striking change from the smil
ing and self confident man'of a short
time before.
How the Aud Went OoWn.
The most. Jhteresttng testimony of the
day was the story of the fate of the
German ship Aud, which was sent out
from Kiel with arms and ammunition
to fulfill In part promises-6f assistance
said to have been made by the Ger
mans.
N N
The Aud was held up "xn suspicion'
off the west coast of Ireland not far
from Bluebell, and was' being taken
to Queenstown when it was sunk by its
own crew.
Deta.ils of the capture and sinklw
were given by Sidney Waghorn, a sig
nal, man on the Bluebell, who Said:'
"Early Good Friday morning the
Bluebell was on patrol duty Off the
southwest coast «f Ireland when we
sighted a ship flying the Norwegian:

it was and where It was bpund. It' re

but it did not do so until we fired fa

away from It and we saw white snjoke
coming from its afterhold. Two. Ger

"Til

were rowed toward the Bluebelf. We
fired around these boats.. They' flew
flags of truce and the odcup^nts put
up their ,Mlands. They were made

N'EW U-BOAT WARNING.
Note by Germany Held to Be Modifica
tion of Assurances.
Washington, May 17,—Germany has
served notice on neutral nations, in
cluding the United 'States, that mer
chantmen which turn their prows to
ward her submarines may be sunk on
sight.
Whether this notice lessens the
scope of the assurances which the
Berlin government gave to the United
States some days ago "will be deter
mined after careful consideration by
the president and Secretary Lansing.
The Instructions to German com
manders which gave effect to the as
surances provided that in .accordance
with t^ie general' principles of visit
and.search and the destruction of mer
chant vessels recognized by Interna
tional law, such vessels should not be
siink without warning and without
saving human lives unless they at
tempted to escape or offer resistance.
There was no suggestion in those
instructions that the position of the
ship at the time of being overhauled
would limit the obligation Of the sub
marine commander.
The German ambassador last Friday
sent a note to the secretary of state in
regard to the Dutch steamer Bandoeng.
The ambassador asserted that when the
vessel was ordered to stop, "permissible
tinder International law," it turned
upon the submarine, 'The submarine
opened fire, which caused the ship to
•toe brought to, and its mastej explained
that he made the maneuver in order to
approach closer to the submarine and
thus expedite the examination.
^The ambassador .said his government
desired to suggest to neutral govern
ments that the masters of their mer
chant ships be given to understand
that in the event of their being stopped
by German warships the provision of
International law must -be observed.
In allied diplomatic circles It Is as
serted that this notice on the part of
Germany is designed to limit the as
surances given to the United' States.
%n administration circles it is
pointed out that is the. duty of a
submarine commander to protect his
own ship and crew, that the frailty
Of-his vessel makes it particularly vul
nerable 14 ramming by a merchantman,
And that" the natural disposition of a
Warship officer undw such circum
stances would be to lire first and place
the responsibility upon the 'merchant
skipper.
