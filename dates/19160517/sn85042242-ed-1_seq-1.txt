"AMERICA FOR PEACE BE.
CAUSE SHE LOVES PEACE"
Speaks of Difficulties of the Past
Three Years and Also the Eu­
ropean Situation.
Washington, May-. 16i—President
Wilson tonight made a frank and in
tiroate review of hjs th.^ee years in
the White House and his impression
of foreign and dpmestiq| problems,
delivered last night befj|e Washing­
ton's correspondents, gathered at the
National Prws club. I®
He- spokfi^l $ffi$lties of the
presidency and particularly of the
motives which have guided his han­
dling of the European situation.
"America," the president said, "is
for peace because she loves peace,
and believes the present war has car­
ried the nations engaged so far that
they cannot be held to ordinary stand
aids of responsibility."
•But he added the United States
has grown to be one of the greatest
nations of the world and therefore
must act. "more or less from the point
of view of the rest of the world."
"If I cannot retain my moral influ­
ence over a man except, by occasion­
ally knocking him down," lie said, "if
that is the only basis on which be
will respect me, then for the sake ot
his soul, have occasionally got. to
knfick him down."
Kept Awake Nights.
The president declared he had been
kept awake nights considering the
European situation, because there
might, come a time when the United
StateB would have to do what it lid
not desire to do, and the "great bur­
den oi} my spirit has been that it has
beeh^lfjv '-fo'ilftHlr «W6ose wlieh that
time came." He added that he did
hot conceive that, he hitd been elect­
ed president to do as he pleased. "If
were, it would have been very much
more interest ing," he said. •$
..DisciiMes the Newspapers.
Impressions of public man, as a
clapi, .were, given frankly by the pres­
ident with the comment that some
gre.w-: and some swelled. He also dis­
cussed the relations of the newspa­
pers" to the affairs of the nation and
sounded a warning that false infor­
mation about foreign affairs was more
than likely to lead to trouble.
The president's remarks, as orig­
inally delivered were read by him
carefully before it was made public,
but no important portions were elim­
inated and the wording was not
changed substantially.

Little Activity Reported From
Troops Mustering in of
Guards Continues.
IMarathon, Texas, May 16.—Col. Sib­
ley and troops of the 14th Cavalry
bringing up tli*1 rear of the second
punitive expedition, have caught up
with Major Langhorne, whose two
troops of the 8th Cavalry were lead­
ing the way into Mexico and have
halted, according to information here
last night. The expeditionary col­
umn has traveled 80 miles into the in­
terior in its object, of rescuing from
Mexican bandits the American ranch­
men, Jesse Demeer, John Woodson, P.
Baltsworth and Monroe Payne. No
ing has been heard from these men
since the bandits took them into Mex­
ico. A rumor was current yesterday
that Major Langhorne's troops engag
ed in a brush with bandits and thai
one American trooper was wounded,
but the report lacks confirmation.
'El Paso, Texas, May 16.—General
Jose Ynez Salazar, a former Orozco
chief, who fled from .El Paso across
the American line some weeks ago,
with the avowed purpose of starting
a revolution of bis own, last Sunday
night attacked the -Santo Domingo
ranch, 30 miles east of Ojo Caliente,
Chihuahua, with a force of three
men, and stole several bags of flour,
according to a report brought to El
Paso today tby an American working
at Santo Domingo. The ranchman,
who told the news to a member of
General Bell's staff, s#iid that the ar
my. of General Salazar, small as it
was, was far from being classed
able-bodied. One of the soldiers pos­
sessed only one eye, another was a
cripple, and the third was deaf and
dumb. After seizing the flour in a
ranch house the revolutionists took
to flight. It was reported through
Mexican sources last week that Gen.
Salazar had notified Ceneral Gutier­
rez, commander of the constitutional
forces in Chihuahua, that he was will­
ing to consider terms of surrender.
San Antonio, Tex—Numerous minor
alterations in the personnel of list of
officers just made by State authorities

SOME MORE PRICES
ARE GOING UP
Chicago, May 16.—That the war in
Europe may materially increase the
price of newspapers, magazines, and
periodicals, was the belief expressed
here today at the meeting of the exe­
cutive committee of the Inlands Daily
Associated Press. The meeting was
called to devise ways and means of
meeting the shortage in paper stock,
and a resolution was adopted urging
the strictest economy in the use of
paper. It was said that in two cities
of 40,000 population, and in smaller
cities, several daily newspapers had
not' issued because of the shortage. It
was reported many newspapers were
on the verge of shutting down com­
pletely or issuing smaller editions.
