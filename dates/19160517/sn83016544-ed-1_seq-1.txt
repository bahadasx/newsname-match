TEUTONS MAKE GAINS
IN FIERCE ATTACKS
Paris, May 8.—In fierce attacks on
both banks of the Meuse the German
forces gained ground from the French.
They entered the French communicat­
ing trenches east of Hill 304 and
gained a footing in the first French
line between Haudremont wood and
Fort Douaumont over an extent of
nearly a third of a mile.
The northern slope of Hill "304,
around which has raged the fiercest
fighting in the Verdun region, has
become a sort of neutral zone, accord­
ing to a statement given out. The
Germans are installed at the foot of
the hill, while the French maintain
their grip on the summit.
The trenches held by the French in
the intervening territory were made
untenable, by the artillery and suffo­
cating gaa! used by the Germans, jbut
their occupation by the troops of the
crown prince has been prevented by
French artillery fire.

FORTY-TWO BANDITS
SLAIN BY AMERICANS
Headquarters, near Namiquipa, Mex.,
(by wireless to Columbus, N. M.,) May
7.—A full squadron of 238 men of the
Eleventh cavalry surprised and rout­
ed a much smaller force of Villa ban­
dits at Ojo-Azules, seventeen miles
south of Cusihuirachic.
Forty-two Mexicans were killed and
a number wounded. There were no
American casualties.
The American command, under Ma­
jor Robert L. Howze, had been pursu­
ing the Villistas under Generals Cruz
Dominguez and Julio Acosta for sev­
eral days when they encountered them
encamped in the huddled adobe huts
of Ojo-Azules.
The Mexicans were utterly surpris­
ed and sprang from their pallets half
clothed.
After firing a few wild shots they
began a flight, each man shifting for
his own safety.
Some of them were able to seize
their horses, already jaded from a
hard day's ride previously, but others
made their way into the hills afoot.

Miss Edith Simpson, a bride of
the ijear future, was pleasantly sur­

were present.

Hill Sunday morning.

Hill Sunday at 10:30 a. m. by Rev.

received a nice present.

Reservation Notes in Rhyme
Business on the Reservation
Is very, very rushing.
It is principally due
To our efforts at brushing.
The poor batchelor boys.
Who live in the burning,
Says their armor plate
Is out of date
Ixcept for clearing.
The price of soap is going up
For no apparent reason,
And just as we are dreaming of
Our spring's cleaning season.
Our styles this week, we observe,
Are riotously tagged—
We farmer boys,
Who milk the cows,
Are very, very ragged.
A bumper crop of April brides
Was Cupid's fond prediction.
The literary workers now prepare
Their season's fiction.
The ladies are said to be
The community's glory.
The mothers of spring
Are on the wiDg,
And Duham told his Btory.
Our patriotic statesmen
Would gladly save our station,
But all their time is occupied
In social communication.
Dr. Hoit, who relieves the suffering,
Will shortly move to his claim.
TheBuckavich boys
Make a lot of noise.
And we are having rain.
Our sages say that the colonel's plat­
form
Is the strongest yet constructed.
'Twill hold a real Mmerican
With politics deducted.
The fowls of early spring
Are laughing in gleeful laughter,
Savior fell down.
Broke his crown,
And Parsons came tumbliug after.
Albert Enerson's pony bolk and brays,
And greatly pains its rider.
The school-mistress looks askance
At those who sit beside her.
Writing poetry, Green says,
Has come to be a lucrative profession.
It sells around
Ten cents a pound,
But rhyme is our obsession.
Our pioneer parades
Are deep in mud and glory,
While the Fanners' Club giiard the
rear
With thund'rous oratory.
For each person five years ago
We now have twenty.
The price of food
Is well nigh rude,
And we have said a plenty.
Dental Notice.
Those having broken plates to be
repaired, mail them to me at Coffey
ville, Kan., in a strong package. My
dental office in the cabin will be open
in the summer as usual.
