Aeroplane Crosses South Carolina,
but is Wrecked
The following account is given
bv the Columbia State of an
attempt by Howard M. Rinehart
to tly from Auguta, Ga. to
New York Saturday:
Howard M. Rinehart, a Wright
aviator, left Augusta early yesterday
morningjfor New York,
and though his machine was
smashed, and he was forced to
abandon it, he has the distinction
of being the first person to
fly from border to border across
the State of South Carolina. A
I sprocket chain of the propeller
broke when Mr. Rinehart was
about four miles from Rowland,
N. C., traveling about 3,000 feel
in the air. He glided and landed
in a newly plowed field. Mr.
Rinehart did not jump, but was
riding on a wing when the machine
landed. He was thrown
off and his head buried in the
sand. He was not injured and
after shipping the remnants of
the biplane tc Dayton, Ohio,
came to Columbia.
"I was just going to New York
ill r/\t?nrVt 4 V* .*~v ? ^ .? 1 ?
iuiv/u?u iiic an iui me pleasure
and to save a little railroads fare,"
said Mr. Rinehart in his room at
a hotel here last night, "and
now," he added, "I will pay both
railroad fare and railroad
freight."
Heavy clouds, the most beautiful
Mr. Rinehart says he has
seen, hung over South Carolina
early yesterday" morning, and
these clouds caused Mr. Rinehart
to deviate from his propos
ed route. He left Augusta at
5; 10 o'clock and had perfect sailing
and ideal weather conditions
until he reached Aiken, where
he ran into the clouds or fog
and did not see land again until
after he had passed Columbia.
"The first glimpse I had of
earth after leaving Aiken," said
Mr. Rinehart, "was caught a
short while before I reached a
plttr ttfUirtK T 1--.^.? ?
V1IJ, VVUIV.11 X 1VL1UVV uow was
Sumter, but which I did not recognize
at the time. I looked
down and saw the trees and water
and more trees and more
water and then more trees I
wondered if I had strayed into
Sout American jungle. I thought
it no nearer to turn around than
it was to go forward, so I continued,
and I was glad when I
left it behind." Mr. Rinehart
was passing over the Congaree
swamp.
The aviator guided the machine
into a small enclosure and
crawled out upon one of the
wings when within 30 feet of the
ground. The heavy engine
plowed its way through the flimsy
aluminum seat.
Falling from such a great
height the aircraft buried its
nose in the soft sand and turned
almost a complete somersault.
Its wings and rudder were a
mass of twisted wire and splintered
wood while the fuel tank
was rent from stem to stern and
the ground was saturated with
gasoline for a radius of several
feet.
The aircraft swooping down
so suddenly upon the quiet community
created consternation
among the inhabitants and it
was several hours after the ac
cident before any of the colored
population could be induced to
approach the scene.

Monroe Has Flowing Well and
Busy Roller Mill

The Henderson Roller Mills ^
Company is putting up flour in
sanitary paper lined bags. The ,
\ d
bags are dust and vermin proof t
and is a great improvement over t
the cotton bag which lets in dust s
and bugs. The Henderson Roll- c
er Mill Company makes good *
flour and it is wholesome. And s
that same Henderson Roller (
1 Mills Company is one of the *
busiest concerns in this town J
and keeps the wheels turning all
1 the time. 1
June 30th is the date each year j
wnen automobilists have to j
come across with $5, $7.50 or j
even $10, according: to the size
of the car, for State license here
in North Carolina. Along about
this time of the year it is rather
remarkable to see the number of
new cars spinning about with
"D No." attached, denoting
dealer, and also many with cards
bearing the legend, "License applied
for." But one new automobile
owner passed through
Monroe a few days ago whose
license bracket brought a smile
to all who observed it. "License
wrote for" in good bold letters
made him immune from all traf
fic cops.
Do you know there is a flow
ing artesian well in the town of
Monroe? It is a fact. Such a
well mav be seen at the Monroe
?- ?

Henderson roller mill. The well s
is a bored one, a little over one 1
hundred feet deep and it is run s
ning now, despite the long dry i
spell, V lively little stream of i
good pure water. Mr. T. C. Lee 1
says when the manufacturing
piant was running water was I
pumped almost constantly and :
apparently had no effect o.i the i
flow of water. The Monroe 1
Manufacturing Co.'s plant is ad
vertised for sale The water 1
supply on the lot should appeal <
mightily to prospective purchas

The citv of Monroe is preparing
to pave the street from the
Gloucester Hotel to the passen
ger station. This hill was '
macadamized three or four years 1
ago with slate rock. It was a
good job when put down and 1
there is no reflection on the
board of aldermen who had the !
work done. But it has been
learned by expensive experience
that slate rock makes a road that 1
the wind blows away and rains 1
wash away in a remarkably
short time. Mayor John Griffith
and Mr. J. E. Henderson, chairman
of the township road commissionprc
Vioxrp 1
u, v U1IV1 UIUIUU^ll' J
lv investigating the subject, j
come to the conclusion that ce- \
meijt streets and roads are the i
most satisfactory and durable <
among the several so called per- !
manent highway materials.
Then, too, Monroe's streets have 1
the advantage of having a hard
macadam surface as a founda- ]
tion for cement. The board i
of alderman have recently 1
purchased a cement mixer ma- i
chine. The township road com <
missioners will let the city use t
the chain gang for the purpose i
of putting down the concrete i
and it is the intention of the city f
fathers to try this new street i
paving on the hill leading to the ^
passenger station at an early

League for World Peace After

t New York, May 12.?Theo- n
; dore Marbur of Baltimore, form- b
i erly United States Minister to tl
r Belgium, at a dinner given by
f him here tonight to members of v
. the league to enforce peace, told o
; of an interview he had with Sir 8
r Edward Grey in which the Brit- s
ish Foreign Minister said he was J3
wholly in favor of the plan of v
t the league to enforce peace, p
. This proposal is that a league of t!
i the great Powers be formed at r
' the close of the war in Europe
to guarantee a lasting peace by *

"Sir Edward Grey," said Mr.
Marburg, |who recently returned r
* from Europe, "expressed the s
j opinion that if some such plan ?
had been in operation when the

i Rid the Coops of Lice and Mites o
"If the young chicks are
drooping around and looking
sick, examine them for lice and
mites," is the suggestion now &
i being given poultrymen by E. P. o
Clayton, head of the Mississippi g
i A. and M. College Poultry De c
, partment. Both the young chicks a
i and the sitting hens are likely to s
; he attacked by these pests at this \\
. time of the year. u
t If lice are found, pull them off o
with the fingers and kill them, s
t then rub a little grease on top of a
the head and under the throat. Q
i Be careful not to get too much, q
[ as much grease is dangerous for b

How to Grow Soy Beans.
In a general way, soy beans
lay be planted and cultivated
y the same general methods
lat are used with cowpeas. It
? very essential that the land be
yell prepared for th's crop, tor,
ne of the chief difficulties in
TAurinnr -

tand. If the land is not well
repared, or if the seed are sown
do deep or too early and the
veather is unfavorable after
Wanting, the chances are that
he seed will not germinate, but
ot.
The planting in the lower
'iedment section and the eastirn
part of the State qiay take
lace anywhere from May 15 to
une lb; while in the upper
^edmont and mountain secion,
the best time for reeding
vill usually be about June 1st.
Ordinary good preparation
;iven the land for corn or coton
will be the kind that should
>e accorded land for this crop.
In planting soy beans, it will
equire about one-half bushel
eed when planted in rows. The
xact amount, of course, will
lepend upon the size of the seed.
Where the beans are sowed
or hay or pasturages purposes,

If the land is well prepared,
nd the season is at all favorable,
he crop can be produced under
iverage conditions by one chop

ivations with one horse cultivaor.

It has not generally been our
xpenence, especially in the
Medmont sections of the State,
hat soy beans did as well as
owpeas when sown broadcast.
Under conditions required for

I Germany Admits Wrong in Attack
Upon Sussex
Washington, May 10.?Gcr
many in a note received by tinstate
department today by cabb
from Ambassador Gerard, ad
mits that a German submarine
torpedoed the channel steamer
Sussex in violation of assurance.'
given the United States, express
es regret for the incident, an
nounces that the submarine com
mander has been "appropriately
punisiied" and declares readiness
to pay an adequate indemnity tc
Americans injured on the vessel.
It was indicated at the state
department that the Germar
statement that the offending
commander had been punished
would be accepted and the Sussex
case considered closed except
for arranging for the payment
of indemnity to the several
citizens of the United States who
were hurt. There probably will
be no attempt to negotiate for
these indemnities or for final
settlement of the Lusitania and
other cases pending, however,
until sufficient time has elapsed
iu uiuicaie now tne last American
note was received in Berlin
and whether die new submarine
policy is being lived up to.
Officials of the state department
noted particularly the passage of
the note which said ' in view of
these circumstances the German
government frankly admits that
the assurance given the American
government in accordance
with which passenger vessels
were not to be attacked without
warning has not been adhered to
in the present case."
Are You Planning to Put Peas
- .Qr Beans After the Oats?? ?
Progressive Farmer.
All oat or wheat land left idle
from June until next year will
I be returning not more than onehalf
what it should. In fact, a
nrrnn ^ f 1 " 1 *
Kivai ucui ui wuuiii mm oili land
in the South would return little
or no net profit were it not for
the legume hay crop following.
Both cowpeas and soy beans
may be planted as late as the
first of July, and every foot of
the stubble land should be planted
to one of them. Either will
make a ton of hay per acre,
worth $15 or $20, and a ton of
such hay in these times of highpriced
feed is not in lv?
at. Or, in case you are one of
the minority that has plenty of
feed, then an acre of good peas
or beans, turned under, will add
nitrogen equivalent to a halfdozen
tons of good stable manure.
Surely it is not possible
that your land is aire idy as rich
and productive as \ u'd like for
it to be.
Land leli bare from now tin
til next spring is wasting. The
hot summer sun will bake it,
burn out the vegetable matter,
and kill the beneficial bacteria
in it. Then when the winter
rains come it will be stripped oi
much of its remaining plant
food. Guard against these evils
by putting ii in peas or beans.
If you haven't the seed, buy
them. The investment will one
| of*the best you ever made.
