'
LONDON, May 17. Sir Roger Casement and Daniel Bailey were
committed for formal trial on charges of high treason in connection with
the Irish revolt, by Sir John Dickinson, presiding Magistrate, at the con
elusion of the preliminary hearing this afternoon.
Both Sir Roger and his soldier confederate will now go on trial for
their lives in the High Court of Justice. If convicted, they probably will
be sentenced to death. In this event Casement wilHiave the privilege
accorded his rank of being hanged
Tho magistrate's decision was an
nounccd alter the Crown, at a brier
session to-day. completed tho frame
work of Its case against tlie two ac
cused men. Counsel for Casement
nnd Bailey, during tho three days of
the preliminary hearing, contented
themselves chiefly with cross-examining
witnesses for the Crown, reserv
ing their actual defenso for the trial
later.
The nature of Casetnent's defenso If
still a mystery. Counsel for U.illcy
will attempt to show that tho former
Irish soldier knew nothing of tho
character of the undertaking upon
which he embarked In a German U
boat. and speedily Informed Uritls.li
authorities of tho plans to foment a
rehc"-on when he landed on the 1-
coast.
According to Bailey's story the plan
of e Sinn Feiners was to seize Dub
lin Castle and hold It until supplies of
mmunltlon camo from the ship Ger
many sent to Ireland with Casement.
MAPS CASEMENT HAD WERE
MADE BY GERMANS.
Maps found In tho possession of
Casement support the contention that
the plans for tho rebellion originated
In the Gorman War Office. Lieut. Col.
Gordon ot tho British War Office In
telllgcncc department testified.
Lieut. Col. Gordon said he had ex
amined maps of Ireland carried by
Casement when he landed from a
German submarine and that none of
them was printed , in Great Britain.
They gave certain details as to land
scape, showing they wore inado un
der the direction of the German War
Office, and thus supported the bcliof
that tho German Government played
an Important part in the scheme for
tho rebellion.
.Second Lieut. Hrlorley of tho War
Office testified to tho previous good
record of Daniel 1. Hulley, Casement s
confederate, while serving In an Irish
regiment.
Col. Nicolas Iiclalew. representing
the KussUn War Office In London,
wis asked to cxumlno u rlflo of Hus
man manufacture taken from the
hold of tho Gorman auxiliary Aud,
which accompanied Sir Roger on hla
expedition to Ireland and was sunk
off the coast.
Col. BeUlew said the rifle was of
tho typo of tKOJ.
A. scabbard and bullet handed to
the witness were not of Kusslan
make, ho said,
Constable Carter, cross-examined
by counsel for Bailey, said that when
Bailey was arrested ho declared he
had Important information to give
tho police. Tho purpose of this tes

NKWrOKT, May 17. Tho United
States mine layer Han Francisco, ono
of tho navy's crack cruisers a quar
ter of a century ago, ran on a shoal
last night thirty miles off Wood's
Holo nnd 100 miles from Boston.
Wireless messages received hero
and at Boston sent to tho assistance
of the San Francisco the battleship
New Hampshire, the coast guard cut
ters Gresham nnd Acushnet and tho
naval tender Melville.
When tho llrst of the ressuo ships
arrived the San Francisco had been
worked off the shoal by her own en
gines, but the fog was so thick and
a southeast galo so violent that It was
deemed advisable to drop anchor and
wait for clear weather. She was
floated at 8.35 o'clock. An ottlclal re
port states tho ship was only Slightly
damaged.
A report that eight of the crew of
the Han Francisco wero drowned
while trying to make shore from the
ship In a whaleboat lacks confirma
tion. This report came by wireless
front a shore stntloii remoto from the
sceno of the grounding and not in di
rect communication with tho Run
Francisco.
The S.A' Francisco, under command
of Commander Arthur MncArthur,
with a crew of 260 men, left Ports
mouth Navy i'ard yesterday, bound
for Brooklyn Navy Yard to Join Ad
miral Fletcher's fleet. Off Capo Cod

WASHINGTON, May 17. President

It Is understood the Pope, In his
mcssago to the President, empha
sized the necessity of this country
not going to war with Germany If an

a review of any steps this Govern
ment may have taken toward accom
plishment of peace recently.
Secrecy has been thrown around
the communications to and from
Pope Benedict. Tho President did
not discuss tho contents of either of
tho communications with members of
his Cabinet other than Mr. Lansing.
