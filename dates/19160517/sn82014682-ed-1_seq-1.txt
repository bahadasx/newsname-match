Asked to Act
PART OF NATION-WIDE
"INDUSTRIAUNVENTORY"
Information to Be Confidential
and Turned Over to War
and Navy Departments
Hawaii's Industrial resources aa
they would be available In war time
are to be inrestlgated and "mobilized
on paper" within the next few montha
by local . business and professional
men. . ,: :
Members here of the American So
ciety of Civil Engineers hare receiv
ed from the New York headquarters
of the society a letter sent through
out the United State informing them
of an early "industrial Inventory" of
Uncle Sam's" manufacturing and pro
ducing reaourcea. Aa one important
section of the United States. Hawaii
la included In this nation-wide inves
tigation. The Information to be collected will
be confidential .and will be turned
over to the war and navy departments
for their use, as the letter say a, "in
formulating plana through which evt
ery resource of this nation may, In
time of emergency, be enlisted quick
ly in 'government service."
The letter received: by local mem
bera of this big engineering society
Is signed by Elmer U Cor th ell, presi
dent, and Charles Warren Hunt, secre
tary. It saya that within the next 30
daya the society is to begin this indus
trial inventory "at the direct request
of the president of the United States."
Besides the American Society of Civil
Engineers, there axe cooperating the
American Institute of Wining Engl-
neers, the American Society, at Mech
anical Engineera, the American Insti
tute of Uectrici.Enlarnd -.the
American Chemical Society.
- Instructions and inventory forms
will teach- the 4 ? ocat - Investigators
through the malls. ' '
European War's Lessons. ' .
- The letter says in part:
. "Nearly two years of the European
struggle has taught us that we must
revise our entire previous conception
of war. A failure on the par.t'of for
eign countries to perfect plans calmly
and efficiently. In time of pece has
led to such econdmlp confusion and to
such fatal delay in industrial mobfllza
tion that the costs both in lives and
money may be counted only by the
millions. We have learned that or
ganized industry is the bed-rock upon
which we must build our .defensive
structure."
In Hawaii, it la pointed out by
those familiar with the situation, some
of the lines of investigation jmlght be
about aa follows: ...'
Pntmihiiitlea for utilizing local iron
works, machine-shops and shlp-bulld-
ing plants in time of war.
Plans for.' turning motor-cars and
trucks over to military authorities In
emerrenclea. -. ' t ,. I
Use. of fertilizer plants for manu
facture of chemfcala used In muni
tions and 'possibilities for securing
services of skilled plantation and ex
periment station chemists.
Problem of food supplies here, what
can be stored nd what raised, both
tor human population and for ani
mals..;, .- ', - ' ,
These are only a fey of the nany
tantnrm under th hAd nf "manufac
turing and producing resources' which
the engineers are asked to invesii
' gate.
How the investigation will be under
taken Is still a question. It Is expect
ed that the written Instructions will
come very shortly. One conjecture
was made this morning that the Ha
waiian Engineering Association might
be asked to cooperate.
