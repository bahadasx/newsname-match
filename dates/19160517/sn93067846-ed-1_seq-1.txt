Ssnlth Will Try to Get One
Nitrate Plant m South Carolina.
Washington, May 13.?The agree?
ment reached here today by the con?
ferees In the military Increase bill is
In reality a victory for Senator E. D.
Smith. For the past week the con?
ferees have been holding dally ses?
sions, and one of the main fights has
waged around the provision fought
through the senate by Senator Smith
of South Carolina for the establish?
ment and control by the. federal gov?
ernment of nitrate plants for the
manufacture - of nitric acid for ex?
plosives and nitrogen In time of peace
to be used in the mixing of agricultu?
ral fertilisers. Various amendments
have bean offered in the conferences
which would practically nullify the
purposes of the Smith bill, but the
conferees felt that inasmuch as this
question had been so thoroughly
thrashed out in the senate and house
and the wishes of both houses so
expressly stated, that their reports
should carry ths Smith nitrate plant
proposition in its original intent and
purpose. This action upon the part
of tbe confereea assures the enact?
ment into law of the meaaure pro?
posed snd championed by tho junior
senator from South Carolina. Senator
Smith will now concentrate his ener?
gies in securing one of these for South
Carolina. But whether South Caro?
lina gets this plant or not Senator
Smith has already done something
which could gain him national recog?
nition from the agricultural Interests
of the country.

next step in the negotiations with the
entente allies regarding treatment of
neutral commerce will be delayed en
account of tha implied threat con?
tained in the German note of May S,
In which the imperial govenment ex?
presses confidence that in view of the
new orders Issued for submarine war?
fare, the United States would insist
upon Great Britain observing the'
rules cf International law In dealing
with trade and reserving to itself
'complete liberty of decision" unless
this end was accomplished.
It wis stated authoritatively today
that Germany's note had complicated
the situation, making It impoaaifee

PAY OP RAILROAD IfE*
l!
I tcmcnt of Railroad
Showing tha Present Wages and
What Increaa Is Asked for by^fc*
gmotrs.
Wellington, May 1?.?"The extent
I to which the wages of men ematoyed
in freight service on railways fit
Southeast would be increased, should
the demands for tha eight-how basic
day and for time and a-half for over?
time ha granted, Is bast shown by il?
lustrations from actual service condi?
tions," says a statement issued by the
executive committee of the Southeast?
ern Railways. . '<
?About pne-half of tha Soutl
roads are, In through freight
of t hours and about one-halt pay
the minimum day at ths end of 9
hours. Tha overtime rate In through
freight service on most of these lines
Is SO cents per hour. In the Eastern
and Western territories 10 hoars as
a rule constitute a minimum day . for
100 miles or less.
"Taking for example an engineer on
a Southeastern line who takes 10
hours to complete a run of 100 miles
or less, using an engine for which his
minimum day's pay is $5.40 and'his
overtime rate 60 cents per hour. On
a line where the eight-hour basis pre?
vails he Is now paid $6.60 If on duty
10 hours. On a line where the nine
hour basis prevails he Is paid $6.00.
"Under the conditions which the
men are demanding, the overtime rate
on a $5.40 engine would be lifted from
60 cents per hour to $1.01 per hour
and for running the same 190 miles or
less In 10 hours as at present the
engineer would receive $7.42.
"In local freight service the stand?
ard day in the Southeast, as In other
territories, Is now 10 hours and the
prevailing rate for the engineer Is
$5.75 with overtime at 60 cents per
hour.
"Should the demands for the eight
hour basic day with time and a-half
for overtime be granted, the overtime
rate would be lifted from 60 cents to
$1.08 per hour, and the engineer run?
ning the same 100 miles or less In 10s
hours would be paid $7.01 per day in?
stead of $5.76 as at present.
"The same ratio of increase would
be shown by comparisons for con*
ductors, brakemen and firemen."

HEARING IN BRANDEIS' CASE.
Subcommittee to Make Supplementary
Report
Washington, May 12.?Reopened
hearings before the senate judiciary
subcommittee investigating the fitness
of Louis D. Brandeis for the supreme
bench began and ended today with
the Introduction of testimony regard?
ing Mr. Brandeis' connection as coun?
sel with the merger last January of
the United Drug company and the
Riker-Hegeman Drug Store company
and a statement by Commissioner
Harlan that Mr. Brandeis' services to
the interstate commerce commission
in the 5 per cent advance rate case
were eminently satisfactory.
The subcommittee, which already
has recommended by a vote of 3 to 2
confirmation of the Brandels nomina?
tion, will draft a supplementary re?
port when today's evidence has been
printed. There was no indication to?
night as to when a vote in the full
committee might be expected.
Commissioner Harlan stated that
Mr. Brandels was employed by the
commission, not to represent the
shippers, but the public in seeing that
all the facts In the rate case were
presented. He said he would have
regarded him as failing in his duty if
he had withheld any important con?
clusions he reached in regard to the
case. Both statements were drawn
out in answer to criticisms of Mr.
Brandels because in his closing argu?
ment of the case he said the net op?
erating revenues of the carriers were
too small.

Put Info Commission With Main
Fleet.
Washington, May 12.?Reorganiza?

within 48 hours. These vessels will be
included in the nine battleships to be
used this summer for naval militia
and citizen volunteer training cruises.
About 4.200 men made available by
the change will be divided between
six destroyers and the new dread?
noughts. There will be 16 big battle?
ships in the new first line of the fleet
including the Pennsylvania, to be de?
livered by the contractors on June 1.
The others are the Minnesota, Ver?
mont, Michigan, South Carolina, Dela?
ware, Oklahoma, New York, Texas,
Florida, Utah, Arkansas, New Hamp?
shire, Nevada, Kansas and Wyoming.
With the addition of 15,000 men in
the navy, proposed in the pending bill
before congress, navy officials said to?
night that it would be possible to take
several ships from the reserve and re?
turn them to actual service. The de?
partment is working out a plan by
Which naval militia can be instantly
assigned, in case of war, to duty in
manning ships in reserve.
While at their home yards the Con?
necticut and Louisiana will have their
boilers and shaft hearings repaired.
New betlere, will be Installed la the

APPAM OWNERS SCORE.
Win Point In Preliminary Sparring.
Norfolk, Va., May 12.?The former
British owners of the steamship Ap
pam, brought to Hampton roads Feb?
ruary 1 by a German prize crew, were
successful in preliminary^ sparring
when the hearing of the libel case for
possession of the vessel and cargo
opened in federal court here today.
They succeeded, over protests of coun?
sel for the German government, in
having admitted into evidence a com?
munication from Secretary Lansing to
Ambassador von Bernstorff, dated
March 2, in which the secretary ex?
pressed the opinion that the liner did
not fall within the protection clause of
the Prussian-American treaty of 1799,
as contended by Germany, because she
came into port alone.
The state department contrary to
what has heretofore been generally
understood, expressed the view that
the treaty grunted asylum for vessels
of war accompanying prizes, but does
not cover the spoils of war deposited
in an American port. It was ponited
out, however, that this was a legal
point, that should bo passed upon by
the courts.

BOY DROWNED AT CONW?Y.

Loses life la Waomiasw River, iff
Cpnway. May 11.?One of the sad-*
dost deaths that has occurred in Cas?
ed in the Waceamsw river,* about
mile from Conway. About one hour
after school had adjourned this af?
ternoon the lad in company with
eight companions went for a swim
up the river. Immediately upon their
arrival the best swimmers swam
across to the opposite bank of tha
stream. m While they were at this
point the Burroughs boy and two of
his companions who had remained at
the initial land in gplaoe waded into
the river which was not very deep.
They were on this shallow bluff and
he must have overstepped into the
main channel which meets the steep
headland abruptly and was drowned
before he could be rescued by his
comrades. Brantley Burroughs was
one of the most popular and brilliant
pupils of the Burroughs sagh school
of this city. The whole town is oast
in deep gloom over the untimely fak?
ing of this young life and in respect
for his memory the school will sus?
pend exercises tomorrow. His body
was recovered a few feet from when
he sank, but it was too late for
resuscitation.
