LET US HAVE [
110,000 IN LINE
"Not less than 10,000 in line!"
The Times suggests this as the slogan for the big preparedness parade proposed for Tacoma j
by the Northwest Business Men's Preparedness league.
Tacoma's heart and soul should be in this demonstration for adequate defense.
This is a critical time in the history of the nation. There arc good, kindly souls imong us
who, wishing for no war and hoping it will be forever abolished —as <lv all of vs —foolishly «>[>-
I pose all preparations against possible enemies.
They would have the world as they wish it were, not as it really is.
Strange to say, there are some who think thus, even on this coast —a coast that is virtually
defenseless and an easy prey for any foe.
In the halls of congress even, there is Sen. Jones, "representatives*' of this state, who has j
taken his stand with the extreme pacificists.
II It is highly necessary, especially on this Pacific coast, to demonstrate to the nation the peo** 1
pie's belief in preparedness as the only guarantee of peace.
The motive power behind the great parade which Tacoms is lo stage is, indeed, peace.
The citizen bolts his door to keep the burglar away. 11
THE NATION MUST DO LIKEWISE, AND TELE NATION'S BOLT IS PREPARED- H
NESS! [I
Don't be slackers!
Get in line!
With the American flag at your head, with patriotic selections from many bands by which to
measure your step, fall in line and show your American patriotism!

PLACE TO TEACH
BIBLE IS HOMES
-SAYS EXPERT
Disagreeing with the theories
of Bible teaching in the city
schools as advanced yesterday by
Dr. Craft at the Sunday school
convention, Dr. Henry F. Cope
said today that the home and the
church were the only logical
places to train young minds In re
ligious subjects
He was against public school
Bible instructions because of the
inability to eliminate creed bias.
lt is impossisble, he believes, to
get a number of teacher.*! who be
lieve along the same Unci. The
result . would be a mix up of
tin.lights and the pupil would
lave no definite ttnderstnndinr of
the Bible when his instruction
was finished, Dr. Cope argued.

In the course of his wanderings
he pleked up a wonderful bun
and on returning home threaten

such a backing for the nomina

The third district is largely re
