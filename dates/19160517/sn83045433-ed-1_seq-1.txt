A PARADE OF PROTEST!
ROADS WIN
MAIL FIGHT
Senate Rejects Postoffice
Proposal to Cut Millions
From Pay.
SPACE PAYMENT PLAN
IS REFERRED TO I. C. C.
Postmaster General Burleson fared
badly at the hands of the Senate
Committee on Postofflocs yesterday. Hl
recommendations for changes in the law
governing raJilway mail pay that would
have reduced the compensation to the
carriers by millions of dollars a year.
were reje-ted and the railway proposal
was adopted.
I'nder this the question of weighing
the mails is to be referred to the Inter
state Commerce Commission and the
commission is directed to report to Con
gress what it regards as a fair adjust
ment of compensation for carrying the I
mails.
The action of the committee, which is
ontrolled by the Democrats. in spurn
ing the Postmaster General's plan of
railway mall pay. came as a surprise to
the administration.
The plan of railway mail pay devised
by the Postmaster General was based
upon the space occupied by the mail in
majil cars. It contemplated a departure
from the present weight system, and, ac
carding to railway ma.1agers, would have
restlted in a big loss to the carriers. At
the outset of the fi ;ht they suggested
that the whole question be referred to
the Interstate Commerce Commission.
The Postmaster General made & protest
to the House against reference of the
question to the commission, and the
House followed his advice.
