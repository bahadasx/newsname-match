Grandma Hickman Has Passed Away.
Grandma Hickmam, one of the hon
re
Marshall county, died at the home of
her daughter in Grafton, N. on
Monday morning. She had reached
more than the allotted time of four
score years, and as her health has
been poorly of late, her death was
not unexpected. The remains will be
brought to Warren for interment in
Greenwood cemetery by the side of
her husband, who died some years
ago
The funeral will be held on Thurs
day afternoon, at one o'clock, from
the old Hickman homestead in town
of Warrenton, which was the ho'ne
of deceased for many years, and at
three o'clock, from the German Lu
theran church in this city. Many
friends and old settlers will no doubt
wish to honor the memory of the de
parted by attending the funeral.
An obituary will be published next
week.
Married:
Arthur Olson and Olga Gustafson,
of Newfolden, were united in mar
riage at the Swedish Lutheran par
sonage in this city on May 13, by
Rev. F. N. Anderson. The witnesses
to the ceremony were Carl Gustafson
and Dorothy Olson
Judge A. Grindeland left for Min
neapolis yesterday to attend a great
church meeting at which the ques
tion of unioni between the Synod and
United Lutheran church bodies will
be finally considered and disposed of.
Many important questions, some of
them of a legal nature, will have to
he solved before the union can be
established. The meeting will last
about a week. If the two organiza
tions combine, the move will be of
far reaching consequences to the
whole Norwegian Lutheran church
of America. Sentiment in favor of
union is strong, and is very likely to
prevail.
Albin Young returned last Satur
day from Jackson, Miss,, where he
has spent the winter looking after
business interests in connection with
the colony of northern people which
he has established. Quite a few from
Minnesota have already bought land
