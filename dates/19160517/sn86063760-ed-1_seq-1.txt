Columbi
Opinion by John L. McLaurin, state
warehouse commissioner, is that man
damus proceedings will be brough
against Fitz Hugh McMaster, state in
surance commissioner, to prohibi
compliance with an interpretation re
cently given by Attorney Genera
Peeples, that non-resident insurance
brokers may not be licensed under the
existing insurance regulations in thi:
state. The question has been brough
Into prominence by the application 0:
Philip LaTourette of New York, rep
resentative of Samuel, Cornwall 4
Stevens. Mr. McMaster realizes tha
Mr. LaTourette might be the means 0
relieving considerably the stringen
situation relative to the insuranc
muddle, but emphasizes that the is
suance of licenses to non-residen
brokers is in violation of the act. Rel
ative to the application of Mr. La
Tourette and the company he rep
resents, Mr. McLaurin said:
have the promise of Samuel
Cornwall & Stevens that if this license
is granted they will take care of sue
business as can not be handled throug
regular channels on account of thi
withdrawal of the. companies. We
are not trying to put local agents on
of business, only to take care of wha
they are unable to do. I don't wan
to injure any man doing a legitimate
business, but I do not propose t
allow our people to suffer by reasot

The letter of Insurrece Commis

"Replying to your recent letter ox

Instructions of the attorney genera
that I should follow the directions o

instreance Loans Are Procurable.
Statistics compiled from the reports
of the insurance companies for year
ending December 31, 1915, show that
the total investments in South Caro
lina state, county and municipal bonds,
first mortgage bonds on real estate in
the state and bank deposits in the
state equal $15,900,000.
The life insurance companies alone
hold a total of $15,017,000 invest
ments. Of these $3,400,000 are in
state, county and municipal bonds,
$11,500,000 in mortgages of real estate,
$81,000 in bank deposits and $7,200 in
property owned in the state.
The fire insurance companies show
a total of $600,000 in state, county and
municipal bonds, $131,000 in real es
tate mortgages and $4,800 in bank de
posits.
The miscellaneous companies show
a total of $148,000, principally in
state, county and municipal bonds.
This $15,900,000 invested in the
South Carolina securities indicated is
highly pleasing to F. H. McMaster, in
surance commissioner. It shows a
wonderful increase m investments
during the time he has been in office.
When he became insurance commis
sioner, the best obtainable records
show, the total investments by all
companies in the class of securities
named equaled about $325,000.
The commissioner states that the
investments are yet on the increase
and that since the reports were made
December 31 he happens to know that
the Penn Mutual Life of Philadelphia
has invested in $250.000 of South Caro
lina state bonds, in two instahces in
real estate mortgages, one being for
$35,000 and one for $8,000 and that a
New York company has in the last few
days agreed to make two loans in Col
umbia, one for $12,000 and another for
about the same amount.
The commissioner states that his
advices from the Carolina Bond and
Mortgage Company, of which H. C.
Barron is president, are to the effect
that the company can handle any
amount of farm loans and city loans
for the larger towns to considerable
amounts. These loans are placed gen
erally with the insurance companies
licensed in the state or other connec
tions of the Carolina Bond and Mort
gage Company.
Another leading agency, that of
August Kohn of Columbia, also ad
vises the commissioner that it is find
ing no difficulty in placing loans for
insurance companies on real estate:
mortgages where the collateral is sat
isfactory.
Manning Drops Two Compnles.
Gov. Manning signed an executive
order mustering out of service Com
panies E and K. Second infantry, lo
cated at Columbia and Elloree. The
action of the governor was upon the
recommendation of the military coun
cil which met in Columbia several
days ago.
Said Gov. Manning: "It is a matter
of extreme regret that it becomes ne
cessary for me to issue the executive
order mustering out these two com
panies. I am deeply interested in the
National Guard of South Carolina, and
am anxious that it be maintained- at
the highest state of efficiency at all
times.
"It seems that the two companies
referred to have not been able to
meet the requirements of the war de
partment. and the federal government
has withdrawn its support.
"In addition to this, the military
council of South Carolina, after go
ing over the recommendations of the
war department, in their report to
me, recommended that these com.
panics be mustered out of service
It then became my duty to approve
this recommendation.
"I deem it of imnportance that the
National Guard of South Carolina be
maintained at all times at the very
highest state of efticiency, and this
action is in the interest only of ef
ficiency in the National Guard."~
Reports Progress In Miii Schools.
George D. Brown, state suipervisor
of mill schools, returned to Columbia
from the Piedmont. where he had gone
to complete his survey of the mill
school conditions in South Carolina.
Mr. B'-own assumed the duties of this
office July 1. 1915, and since that time
has visited each of the 174 mill
-schools in the state.
Many of them have voted special
tax levies for additional teaching force
-and maintenance, and a considerable
pumber have voted bond issues for
modernly equipped buildings. In addi
tion to this, scores of night schools
have been conducted in mill villages,
which have been a powerful factor in
-creating sentiment for better day
school attendanlce by the children,
and equally influential In encouraging
patrons to invoke the compulsory fea
-ture of the state public school law.
Work for special tax levies and bond
issues for buildings and maintenance
will be continued until the close of the
school year. July 31. Much of the
teritory is covere:1 in an automobile.

OLD GUARANTEE
BOlDER PROTECTION
MAJOR GENERAL FUNSTON IS
PLANNING REORGANIZATION
OF BORDER PATROL.
5,000 MEN ALONG BORDER
Funston's Almost Compact Column
on Border Would Guarantee
Against Further Raids.
San Antonio, Texas.-Major General
Funston began the consideration of a
plan for the reorganization of the bor
der ptro. Having under his direct.
control almost 50,000 men he outlined
to his staff a re-distribution of forces
that he believed would guarantee the
protection of American residents from
Mexican raiders.
Already forces at border stations
have been strengthened and, it was
indicated that before the end of the
week the greater part of the regular
troops and militia that have been sent
into the three border states would be
prepared and in position for quick
service along the international line.
It is improbable that more troops
will b^ sent to Colonel Sibley In
charge of the little expedition that
crossed into Mexico near Boquillas as
a result of the raid at Glenn Springs
and Boquillas a week ago. Four de
tachments are now operating close to
the lines, scouting through a limited
territory south of the border; but there
never has been any intention of send
ing forward at that point a punitive
expedition that would compare in size
to that of General Pershing in the
State of Chihouhua.
Army officers here are deeply inter
ested in the efforts of the Mexican
troops were reported to be making to
run down the bandits who raided the
Big Bend district and who yet hold
as a prisoner Jesse Deemer, an
American storekeeper. It is regarded
here as not impossible that the Mexi
can troops may cut off the retreat to
wards the interior of the bandits and
force them back within reach of Col
onel Sibley's cavalry.
DECIDE UPON ARMY OF
250,000 MEN FOR U. S.
Backed By a Federalized National
Guard of 425,000 Men as Reserve.
Warhington.-A standing army of
206,000 fighting men capable of being
expanded in emergency to 254,000 and
backed by a federalized National
Guard of 425,000 as a reserve, finally
was agreed on by House and Senate
conferees on the army bill. The agree
ment will be reported to Congress at
onse and the measure, the first of the
Administration preparedness bills. is
expected to be before President Wil
son for his signature soon afterward.
Advocates of adequate National de
fense regard the conference agree
ment as a triumph. The compromise
between the House and Senate meas
ures was effected after weeks of
struggle against an insistant demand
from House conferees for a standing
army of only 140.000 men.
The minimum enlisted strength
would be attained under the confer
ence agreement within the next five
years and it is stipulated that at no
time shall the total be less than
160,000.
LIMBERK AND MECHANIC
KILLED IN BIG AUTO RAC.E
New York.-Carl Limberg, an auto
mobile racer, and R. Pallotti, his
mechanician, leading the field in the
fifteenth lap of the 150-mile race for
the Metropolitan trophy, were killed
when their machine crashed into a
guard rail on the Sheepshead Bay
track.
Limberg, who had been taking the
turns near the very top of the high
saucer track, apparently lost control
of his car, while rounding the bend at
a speed of more than 100 miles an
cur. Both men were catapulted 100
feet over the rail and crashed to the
ground about 30 feet below. The drir
*er was impaled on an upright piece
of timber and waws killed instantly
Palotti died on the way to the Coney
Island hospital.
The machine, one of three French
cars imported for the race by Harry~
S. Harkness, crumpled under the im
pact and burst into flames. The blaz
ing car clung to the rail as other driv
ers flashed past without slackening,
speed. ignorant of the fate of their
fellow racer. A flash of flame and a
cloud of black smoke told the specta
tors that an accident had happened.
but as it occurred at the far turn of
the two-mile sauc-er few realized that
it marked a traredv.

Near Future At a Cost of $150,
000.-Mass Meeting.
Orangeburg.---Orangeburg will erect
a packing house in the near future to
cost $150,000. The packing house
meeting held recently at the court
house was a big success. Men from
all sections of Orangeburg county and
other counties were present. The
meeting was a representative one and
the purpose was accomplished. At
,this meeting $80,000 was subscribed
and the balance of the $150,000 will be
easily raised by canvass in Orange
burg and other counties.
Among the goverment officials in
Orangeburg to attend this meeting
were: Dr. W. W. Long, state demon
stration agent; C. A. McFadden, dis
trict farm demonstration agent; L*'L.
Baker, superintendent of pig clubs;
L. W. Summers, district demonstration
agent; Dr. L. S. Wolfe, Orangeburg
county farm demonstration agent. Dr.
,Long delivered a highly interesting
and instructive address. Dr. Long
showed that Orangeburg was the log
ical place for the packing plant, be
cause as a result of his census of the
hogs raised in South Carolina more
hogs are raised in a radius of 75
miles of Orangeburg than any other
city in the state. Dr. Long told of
how the United States government
would assist in the work and in gen
eral imparted potential information to
the Orangeburg business men and
others interested. Dr. Long stated that
he was highly pleased with the meet
ing and the prospects for the plant.
Dr. Long was cognizant of the push
of the Orangeburg business men, who
now are possessed of the spirit to do
things.
Among others who addressed the
meeting were Robert Lide, James M.I
Albergotti and M. 0. Dantaler of the
committee that visited the Moultrie
plant. Robert Lide read the report
and recommendation of the commit
tee. Others delivered addresses, and
of especial note was the address de
livered by John W. Grier of Moultrie,
Ga. He told of the working of the
plant at Moultrie and the great suc
cess attained. Mr. Grier was enthUsi
astically applauded.
When the matter of subscriptions
I was entered into several pledged de
. nominations of thousands between
41,000 and $5,000. With about 300
present at this meeting $80,000 was
I ubscribed. The matter of rasiing
the rest will be easy. The plan.Is to
endeavor to scatter this stock over
Orangeburg and other counties of the
state.
Other than the money subscribed,
other business transacted was as fol
lows: That a packing plant be es-.
tablished at Orangeburg and a cor
poration formed for such purpose
I known as the Orangeburg Packing
company; that the capital stock. be
.ixed at $150,000, to be divided into
3,000 shares of the par value of $50
each.
Profitable Asparagus Season.
Edgefield.-The asparagus growers
of the Trenton section of Edgefield
county have closed most profitable
season they have ever had. They
have received this spring an average
price of $3 per dozen bunches for their
asparagus. After the asparagus is cut
from the field It Is carefully sorted
into four grades, the price ranging
from $2.75 per dozen for the lowest to
$6 per dozen for .the best grade, which
Is about double the price received sev
eral years ago. The higher price is
the result chiefly of their system of
co-operative marketing.

The earliest streaks of dawn were
lightening the eastern sky when the
creaking of the windlass and the rattle
of chains announced that the men
were drawing the stop logs from the
dam.
With a grand flourish the last log
was laid on the platform and the great
torrent of green-and-white water went
foaming down the slide. Then the
boom that held back the logs was
drawn aside, and down they came like
a flock of sheep heading for the fold.
By sixes and sevens they plunged into
the pool below, rising again in the
swift torrent at various angles; then
circling madly round until at last they
made their way through the narrows
and on down the river.
Dave Mordaunt, the foreman, whis
tied gayly as he watched the logs pass.
But suddenly he saw with uneasiness
that the men stationed at the narrows
could not keep the logs moving fast
enough. A Jam was beginning to
form.
"Shut her off," he called, "and hus
tle down here! The narrows are
choked!"
The men swiftly swung out the light
boom and checked the flow of logs.
Then, shouldering their poles, the ten
of them marched after their boss down
the narrow path that led to the lower
end of the bay.
The path was merely a shelf in the
face of the cliff, which rose above it
for nearly a hundred feet. Ten feet
below was another shelf, the lower
path. It was even narrower and more
slippery.
The men loosened the jam, and the
logs once bore hurried down the
stream. Then they shouldered the long
poles again and started -back up the
path toward the dam.
"Hark!" shouted the foreman, hold
ing up his hand for silence. From their
left, above the roar of the water, came
yelping of a pack of wolves.
"They are after a deer!" cried Ben
Ford.
Even as he spoke the deer came in
sight. It was hard pressed; clouds of
steam rose from its panting sides, and
its drooping head and protruding
tongue showed that it was completely
exhausted.
The men cheered as it passed, but
it paid no attention to them. Round
the narrow lower path it stumbled,
and.oZL reaching the narrows, which
were now free of logs, it plunged in.
The rushing current carried it down
the river, but it gained the other shore
at last and lay down, panting.
"Now, boys," cried Mordaunt, "the
wolves will follow the path the deer
took! Gather a lot of rocks and spread
yourselves along the path. When the
wolves are past me I will give the sig
nal. Then let go the stones. After
that you can go to them with the pike.
Don't let one get through."
The men made every preparation to
ive the wolves a warm reception. In
a few minutes the animals appeared.
six of them, running close together.
As they reached the narrow path they
fell into single file without ,lessening
their speed. As they ran they gave
occasional short yelps.
Their tongues were hanging out and
there was foam about their mouths
and gleaming teeth. Without an up
ward glance they ran in between the
wall and the rushing, foaming water.
"Now for them!" shouted Dave.
With a yell the men sent down a :how
er of stones'on the unsuspecting pack.
With howls of pain and surprise the
wolves looked up and saw their foes.
Down went their tails and they tried
to retreat; but they were in a trap.
One by one they were pushed off into
the hurrying water.
Only the leader of the pack was left
alive. Ho had been knocked Into the
water by a stone, but had managed to
gain a footing on two logs that were
floating close together. As the logs
drifted apart, he mounted the larger,
on which he crouched, a picture of ab
ject fear. The log began to move slow
!y- toward the narrows. Nearer and
neaer It came to the mighty mass of
water pouring out through the gorge.
The wolf backed to the far end of the
log and crouched there, shivering.
"I hate a wolf worse than poison,"
said Job Nelson, "but I can't see that
brute scared plumb to death before
being drowned."
"Neither can I, Job," said the fore
man, "and he sure put up a good fight
The circling current brought the log
to a point just below where the men

lower path. He stretched out his pole

ccupant to the shore. Then he quick
ly rejoined his comrades.
"Now, boys,'' he said, "that beggar
must pass you all. Anyone who wants
h'm can have him.''
Realizing that he was free, the wolf
leaped ashore and slouched along the
path with one eye on the men above.
Not a hand was raised against him.
On reaching the divide he struck off
at a swift lope and disappeared from

Pate, "the statement of the antipre

Carlyle was a pacifist. Indeed, he
was! At one time a worshiping Amer
