HEW TO THE UNE; LET THE CHIPS T?ATT, WHERE THEY MAY
Vol. XXI.
GHIGAGO, JUNE 3, 1916
Na. 37 .
Echoes on the Failure of The Rfev.Hon. Archibald James Carey,
Ph.D. D.D., to be Elected One of the New Bishops of
the A. M. E. Church at the General Conference at
Philadelphia, and at the One Hundredth
Anniversary of that Church.
THE APPEAL OP ST. PAUL, MINN"., AND THE GREATEST WEEKLY
NEWSPAPER IN THE WORLD PUBLISHED IN THIS CITY WITH
THEIR STRONG BACKING, BOTH LOUDLY PREDICTED THAT WITH
OUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION THAT AS THE "GIANT OF THE
WEST" THAT HE WOULD BE ELECTED ONE OF THE NEW BISHOPS.
HON. EDWARD HEZEKIAH BROWN MORRIS HEAD OF THE GRAND
UNITED ORDER OF ODD FELLOWS WHO AT ONE TIME WAS THE
EMINENT ATTORNEY FOR THE "GAMBLER'S" TRUST AND MANY
OTHER COLORED LAWYERS HIGHLY END'OESED HIS CANDIDACY.
DR. DANIEL H. WILLIAMS, THE FAR FAMED ADVANCED SURGEON
AND PHYSICIAN AND THE MAJORITY OF THE OTHER pOLORED
M. D.'S IN THIS CITY, ALL JOINED IN THE MOVEMENT TO ELE
VATE HIM TO THE BENCH OF BISHOPS.
FOUR YEARS AGO OR AT THE GENERAL CONFERENCE AT KANSAS
CITY, MO., IN 1912, THE REV. GENTLEMAN CAME WITHIN TWELVE
VOTES OF BEING ELECTED' GENERAL FINANCIAL SECRETARY OF
THE CHURCH AND WITH ALL OF HIS ENDORSEMENTS FOR BISHOP
IT IS CLEARLY EVIDENT THAT HE IS SLIPPING BACKWARD
INSTEAD OF-MOVING FORWARD IN HIS CHURCH.
ALL THE PRESENT CHURCH OFFICERS WERE RE-ELECTED AND THE
BISHOPS ASSIGNED TO 'JL'HHIK VARIOUS DISTRICTS FOR THE NEXT
FOUR YEARS.
It "was utterly impossible to eovertspeeial trunf- Pullman- van wbieh
all the ground in the last issne"ofJHlSTfan oxer the Wabash Railroad and the
paper on the utter failure of the BeT.
Hon. Archibald James Carey, Ph. D.'lX
D. to be elected one of tho' new-3lsh-ops
at the A. M. E. General Confer
ence at Philadelphia? Pa., and tiis fail
ure to land is still the talk, of the en
tire country and something must be
radically wrong with him when we
take into consideration the fact that
he had a most wonderful drag and
that he was the most highly endorsed
political preacher of all the candidates
seeking that time honored position.
The Appeal of St. Paul, Minn., which
was his official organ in the northwest
declared in its last issue just before
they began to ballot for Bishop at
Philadelphia, that "information from
all parts of the country is to the effect
that Rev. A. J. Carey, A. M., D. D.,
Ph. D., minister and warden of the
Institutional Church, Chicago, will be
one of the strongest candidates to
come before the General Conference
of the A. M. E. Church, which meets
in Philadelphia in May. That his elec
tion is practically assured is the con
sensus of opinion among the well in
formed delegates, leading preachers
and prominent laymen.
Dr. Carey has the indorsement of
practically every person of prominence
in Illinois. The A. M. E. ministers
are for him to a man and have issued
a circular letter in his behalf; the lead
ing members of the bar, headed by
Edward II. Morris, the foremost law
yer of the country have issued a
printed endorsement; the leading phy
sicians and surgeons, headed by Dr.
Daniel II. Williams, the most famous
physician and surgeon, have united in
an endorsement, and men of every pro
fession and calling, not only in Illinois
but in every state in the union, have
endorsed tho militant pastor and, what
is better, we have it on good authority
that Dr. Carey's friends have secured
pledges from enough delegates to make
his election sure."
The very fact that the Hon. Edward
Hezeknoah Brown Morris who was for
many years attorney for the "Gamb
ler's Trust" and who is the grand
high priest of the Grand United Order
of Odd Fellows, highly endorsed him
in tho end proved to be tho greatest
loadstone which was hung around his
tricky political neck.
In speaking of the chances of the
Bev. Hon. Archibald James Carey, Ph.
D- D. D. to become one of the new
Bishops the greatest weekly newspaper
in tho world which is published in this
eity lauded him to the high heavens
w one of its issues just as he started
off for the General Conference in a
would-be new Bishop marched or stood
at the head of the Illinois delegation
all the time.
" Among the andidatei for Bishop
ric honors whose candidacy seems to
havo a considerable lead is Illinois'
favorite son, Dr. A. J. Carey. The dep
utation represented by fifty delegates
and visitors, all full of enthusiasm for
Dr. Carey, who has been dubbed "The
Giant of the West." They hare estab
lished headquarters near the ehurch
where the sessions of the conference
will be held, and are planning a system
atic, dignified campaign in the interest
of their candidate. Expressions on
every hand and among the southern
delegates indicate that recognition will
be given the west in the election and
that Dr. Carey has the first call on
their consideration for the honor.
From present indications this General
Conference will surely confer upon Chi
cago and Dr. Carey, the intrepid elo
quent and fearless candidate of our
throbbing metropolis, the signal and
high honor of electing him to the
Bench of Bishops of the great A. M.
E. Church."
The great majority of the Colored
M. Ds., in this city under the leader
ship of Dr. Daniel Hale Williams who
is one of the most eminent and far
famed surgeons and physicians in this
country, highly endorsed him but even
they and the Colored lawyers who also
highly recommended him for Bishop
wore unablo to hold him and prevent
him from plunging headlong down to
a disgraceful defeat; there is an old
saying that the "mills of the gods
grind slowly and exceedingly fine,"
and they finally succeeded in grinding
the Rev. Hon. Archibald James Carey,
Ph. D. D. D., up into very thin corn,
meal or light powder.
Four years ago or at the General
Conference which was held at Kansas
City, Mo., in May, 1912, this paper did
not put up a fight against him, for at
that time the writer was sick unto
death, and he came within twelve votes
of being elected general finanacial
secretary of the church and for some
cause or other with all of his endorse
ments for Bishop he seems to be mov
ing backward every day instead of
marching or advancing forward and
that he ia permitting the bright red
banner of his Lord to trail in the dust.

were re-elected and they are as xoi

term. Strongly endorsed by the Chicago Bar Association who received

ites; to be voted for at tho Judicial election, Monday, June 5th.
xrv.'K'Jnin'o- "F.iMnnel. tho vounrest son
of Prof, and Mrs. William Emanuel,
ssa Rhodes avenue, returned home
the first of the week for the summeri
from attending school at the Moor
house College, Atlanta, Ga.
Hoa. Tbbert E. Turney, Republican
candidate for re-eleetion as Judge of
the Superior Court, was born in this
city forty,-three years ago; he received
his early education in the common and
high schools of his native city, after
whieh he entered the office of David
x'ales, where ho began the study of law
in 1892, later on graduating from the
Kent College of Law with high honors,
being admitted to the bar in 1896, he
was engaged in the active practice of
his profession until 1902, at that time
ho was appointed assistant city attor
ney by John F. Smulski, while serving
the city in that capacity ho was one
of the hardest workers in that office.
He was tull of ambition so he con
tinued to climb higher and higher and
three years from that time or in 1905
he severed his connection with the city
attorney's office to aeeept an appoint
ment as assistant state's attorney, be
ing appointed to that position by Hon.
John J. Healy, later on he was appoint
ed assistant County Judge by Judge
Lewis Rinaker, in all of those honored
positions, Judge Turney, mors than
proved himself to bo a straightforward
painstaking public official.
In 1915, he was elected Judge of the
Superior Court, short term, and for the
past year he has spent most of his time
in presiding in the Criminal Court and
so far he has a splendid Judicial rec
ord to his credit; he is evenly tem
pered and he understands just how to
separate or untangle tho wrangling
lawyers whenever they become tied up
in knots whilo arguing in favor or
against the various points in law in
connection with their cases.
Judge Turney belongs to the great
army of married men and he and his
charming wife Mrs. Turney, reside at
1353 Wilson Ave., in the S5th Ward.
He is an honored member of the Chi
cago Bar Association, the Chicago Law
Institute, the Hamilton Club, the Com
mandery, Shrine, Elks, Masons, Knights
of Pythias and other fraternal organ
izations. Attorney F. L. Barnott, Dan. M.
Jackson, Lawyer B. F. Moseley, Ed
ward H. Wright, Samuel A. McGowan,
Russell White and many of the other
Colored friends of Judge Turney, are
sounding his praises for ho is fair and
square on the "Race Problem," and on
Monday, June 5, their votes will assist
to re-elect him one of the judges of the
Superior Court.
JUDGE WENDELL PHILLIPS STAF
FORD OF WASHINGTON, D. C,
WHO IS ONE OF THE HEAD
LEADERS IN THE NATIONAL AS
SOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCE
MENT OF COLORED PEOPLE IN
HIS RECENT OPINION DE
CLARED THAT HE COULD NOT
PREVENT THE BIRTH OF A NA
TION FROM SHOWING IN THAT
CITY.
Capt Louis B. Anderson, Assistant Cor
poxmtioxL Counsel of Chicago was Fif
toesr Days Too Late in Filing his
Btif8 In the Appellate Court In the
Birtti Of A Nation Case in This City.
Tier High City Officials Winking At
Ikr Dismissal.
SeatethiBg over one year age Judge
William Fenimore Cooper decided in
his opinion that under the Laws of this
state that ho was absolutely power
less to prevent the "Birth of a Na
tion" from showing in this city and af
ter he -ksk refused to. issue an injunc
tion forever restraining it from show
ing in this city, the city through its
law department appealed from his opin
ion and went on to the Appellate
Court. It seems that Capt. Louis B.
Anderson had charge of the city's end
of the case but for some cause or
other he failed to file the briefs until
fifteen days after the time had expired
for filing the same permitting it to die
of its own weight.
Last week Judge Wendell Phillips
Stafford who is a member of the Na
tional Association for the Advancement
of the Colored People handed down an
opinion to the effect that he was un
able to stop tho Birth of a Nation from
showing in Washington, D. C, which
amply proves that Judge Cooper was
not far from the truth when he decided
or ruled as he did in the "Birth of a
Nation4 that some of the politicians
endeavored to make political capital
out of his finding for the benefit of
Mayor William Hale Thompson.
