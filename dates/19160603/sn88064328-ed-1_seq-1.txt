"MARTHA'S VINDICATION"
In this story there is a strong undercurrent of protest
against religious bigotry, particularly that of organizations
which arrogate to themselves the privilege of making a sup
erficial examination of the lives of members and of bringing
about social destruction where social helpfulness would be
more in accord with the spirit of Christianity.

CALLS LOUISIANA'S LANDS CHEAP
EST IN GULF SECTION.
Kansas Grain Dealer Says That Adver
ting Would Bring Settlers.
"If Louisiana lands were advertised—
that is properly advertised, and the world
informed of the magnificent opportunities
awaiting the agriculturist in the gulf
section, there would be an influx of popu
lation to the state that would be truly
amazing."
E. J. Smiley, secretary of the Kansas
Grain Dealers' Association of Kansas
before his departure for Topeka, Friday,
sat in his room at the St. Charles Hotel
and expressed his opinion of conditions
as he found them in Louisiana. And Mr.
Smiley became enthusiastic when speak
ing of the state's splendid farm lands.
Mr. Smiley was here for several days
attending a conference of grain interests
of the Middle West, which conference
decided that Galveston must adopt the
New Orleans grain inspection system or
lose the bulk of the grain business now
handled at the port. During his visit
he was a guest at the St. Charles.
"I went through Louisiana on the
Southern Pacific," said Mr. Smiley; "I
made the daylight trip just so that
could see the land and judge of its qual
ity. I expected to find after we left the
Texas border, cypress swamps with
raised tracks running through the dreary
wilderness, but instead I saw a highly
cultivated stretch of country failing away
in well kept acres on either side the rail
road to the distant sky-line. The coun
try astonished me; I could see
glance that it was rich land and best of
all it was cleared land, ready for the
farmer to plant his seed.
Now, it's my judgment, that if Louisi
ana would advertise to the world what
it has in productive land, to half the ex
tent Florida advertises its land, there'd
be no computing the results in big and
early profitable sales.
^Louisiana has a soil that is unequaled
in fertility; a soil that can be found no
place else in the country. Ea3t Florida
coast lands are being sold to Kansas and
Missouri investors at from $75 to $i00
an acre and the purchased has to clear
the land of stumps and timber. As I
understand it, Louisiana lands can be pur
chased for from $75 to $125 an acre, and
the land i« already cleared, ploughed and
in cultivation. The cost of clearing the
Florida land costs from $25 to $75 an
acre, and as a general proposition Louisi
ana land is not only better but cheaper.
"There is a disposition on the part of
farmers in Kansas, Missouri and Iowa
to seek warmer climate, and why does
not Louisiana tell these farmers what
they can buy for their money in this, the
richest agricultnral section in the South?
ANOTHER CONFERENCE.
"First Chief" Carranza's note demand
ing an explanation of the continued stay
of American troops in Mexico was de
livered in Washington yesterday. About
the same time General Gavira left
J uarez for Casas Grandes for a confer
ence with General Pershing respecting
the co-operation of American and Mex
ican forces. Although the reinforce
ments ordered to North Mexico after
Obregon's Conference with Gen. Scott
have reached the posts assigned to them,
it appears that they have not yet begun
their "drive" against the outlayed Vil
lista bands. According to the plans an
nounced, they were to encircle the in
fested districts and catch the bandits or
force them against the American troops,
who may be depended upon to deil
promptly with such as come their way.
But General Pershing, according to
dispatches from Chihauhau City, finds the
Mexicans apparently unwilling to co
operate. Accordingly the conference with
General Gaviro has been arranged. He
will try to persuade that officer to co
operate, as Scott persuaded Obregon that
co-operation was necessary. Much more
is to be hoped from the conference from
the correspondence between Washington
and Mexico City. Unhappily, Gen. Gav
ira, no matter how thoroughly convinced
of the wisdom of co-operation, may be
blocked by the first chief, whose present
note testifies anew to his marvelous ca
pacity for misunderstanding. Obsessed
by the idea that his official dignity is
impaired, General Carranza seems unable
to take thought of anything else. His
new note demands an "eexplanation"
that has been in his hands for weeks.
Only the first chief's thinking makes
the present situation difficult, or deli
cate. Claiming both the ability and will
to police North Mexico, round up the
Mexican outlaws and murderers who are
foes to both governments, and prevent
further invasion of American soil, he has
demonstrated neither the ability nor the
will to do any of these things. The
same claims were of record when Colum
bus was raided. They were repeated
dering the interval between that outrage
art* the Glenn Springs raid. Both in
vasions testified their past emptiness. To
his new demand for "explanations" the
answer might be returned that the with
drawal of American troops only awaits
the demonstration that he is at last able,
and willing, to make good his claims—
Times-Picayune.
A Laxative Blood Cleanser.
Don't put off taking a treat
ment of Po-Do-Lax. Your system
cleanser and tonic—nothing like
Po-Do-Lax to purify the blood,
gently move the bowels and stim
ulate the liver to healthy action.
The first dose releases the accum
ulated poisons. It is a laxative
tonic for young, adult and aged.
Its mild non-griping action com
mends it to delieate women.

DR. DAVID STARR JORDAN.
Lafayette, La., May 31, 1916.
President E. L. Stephens, of
the Southwestern Louisiana In
dustrial Institute announces that
he has secured a positive engage
ment from Dr. David Starr Jor
dan. President of Stanford Uni
versity, California, to deliver an
address before the Institute Sum
mer School on Tuesday evening,
June 13th. President Jordan is
one among the half-doen most dis
tinguished • of American citizens,
and it is expected that many will
cotne to Lafayette from neighbor
ing towns and parishes to hear
hint speak.
All arrangements are complete
for'the 9 wet*ks Summer Normal
terfca of the Institute, next Mon

primary reading. Students and
teachers attending the Summer
School wiii be given credit to
wards a regular diploma in the
Institute. This diploma is now
fully recognized by the iState as

Certificate without examination.
WHY IT SUCCEEDS.
Because It's for One Thing Only,
and New Iberia People Ap
preciate This.
Nothing can be 'good for every
thing.
Doing one thing well brings
success.
Doan's Kidney Pills are for one
thing only.
For weak or disordered kid
neys.
Here is reliable evidence of

William Elmer, 122 Oranere
St., Lafayette, La., says: "My
back was so lame and stiff, I could
hardly raise my foot off the
ground without awful pains in
the small of my back. I was laid
up half of the time, unable to get
about. My kidneys were very ir
regular in action. The first box
of Doan's Kidney Pills brought
me relief and after finishing two
boxes, I was a'ble to get around,
as well as ever. I haven't had
the least sign of kidney trouble
-since."

ICE TEA BAD FOR KD NEYS.
Many authorities aaree that tea
is bad for the kidneys, but it is
a recognized fact that the Indians
tirewed teas from roots and herbs,
which when drunk hot were very
beneficial. A tea of this kind
which is a wonderful medicine is
Ge-Rar-Dy Tea, which eliminates
the poisons from the blood, liver
and kidneys. It is so inexpensive
—only 10 cents a package at Jno.
R. Taylor & Bro. and all other
druggists—that most every home
has it. The Phil P. Cresap Co.,
Ltd. of New Orleans, La., will
send a free Sample.
