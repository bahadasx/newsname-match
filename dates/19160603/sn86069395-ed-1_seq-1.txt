TALKS HADE
BYflZENS
At a Hearing By the Ken
tucky Tax Commis
sion. MAYOR YOST PRESIDED
Opening Address Was Made
By Geo. E. Gary Other
Speakers.
The Kentucky Tax Commission,
composed of Senators Huffakcr, Pick
ett, Glenn and Brock and Represen
tatives Hutchcraft, Gardner and Oliv
er held a session here Thursday after
noon to confer with business men.
The meeting was at the IL.B. M.
A. and Mayor Frank Yost presided
and introduced Geo. E. Gary as the
principal speaker.
After expressing his gratification at
the presence of the Commission and
the plan for forming a tax law, Mr.
Gary got down to bases at once and
spoke in part as follows:
Our present tax rate would, if all
property was fully reported, suffice
for five times tho requirements of the
state. The tax should be lowered in
stead of raised, so that when listing
his property the taxpayer would not
feel that it was practical confiscation.
As the rate now is, it puts a penalty
on honesty and a premium on per
jury.
Massachusetts taxes savings de
posits 25c on the $100.00. Kentucky
$2.5p on the $100.00. Their capital is
growing by leaps and bounds. Ours
is dwindling constantly.
Pennsylvania's revenue from taxa-
tion tor luu was 3z millions, ours
only 7 millions.
Rink statements that year showed
130 millions on deposits and only 13
millions were reported by the tax
payers, Kentuckians are not less
honest than those of other states,
They are up against a foolish law, un
der which they think they could not
thrive upon an honest report of their
property. Lower the rate and they
will respond. Capital is being driven
out of the state. Farmers are the bag
holders. Their lands are visible, and
are taxed twice. Once on land and
again on loans on the land. Get away
from the old uniform rate idea. Tax
some things high and some low, and
in forming a law have always in view
the idea of increasing new capital.
I hat s what we need, more money
in this state.
At the rate of its being considered
beside the mark and beyond the pole
of the Commission, he said that our
greatest trouble in Kentucky was
fundamental. We would never be a
wealthy state without more manufac
tures; and tho years of observation
and experience as a manufacturer led
him invitably to the conclusion that
no factory could flourish in any stato
whero the incoming and outgoing
rates were over double what they
are in the states just across the Ohio
river.
t
Kentucky, Tennesseo, tho Virginias
and Carolinas, and all the Southern
' states all groan under this burden of
, rate discrimination and havo done so
' since the war, notwithstanding the
j fact that nine-tenths of the navigable
! streams of the U. S. are South of tho
Ohio river. The roads will not for
ward river freight.
With a Southern President, and
, with Southern mon as leaders in tho
Senate and House, it would seem that
some relief in this direction should be
counted upon. More factories means
more capital and smaller tax rates.
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts have
low tax rates and unlimited capita).
Kentucky with great coal and timbo'r
wealth has practically no manufac
tures. Tho railroad rates are tho un
derlying, prohibitory feature."
j Other speakers were W. T; Tandy,
John H. Bell, Frank Rives, M. C.
Forbes and J. 0. Cook.
Miss Marietta Merritt has returned
from Anniston, Ate., where she taught
school.
HOLD CARRANZA
NOTE OFFENSIVE
Washington May Adminster
Sharp Rebuke for Ques
tioning U. S. Faith.
GEN. PERSHING TO REMAIN
Implied Threats in Communi
cation Do Not Cause Rip
ple Among Officials.
Washington, June 2. Gen. Car-
ranza's note demanding withdrawal
of American troops from Mexico has
brought no change in the determina
tion of President Wilson to maintain
the present troop disposition until the
ability of the dc facto government to
police its side of the border has been
demonstrated. It was stated authori
tatively that Gen. Pershing's force
would remain where it is until that
time arrived.
While official confirmation is with
held it is understood that the tone of
the document is regarded as off en
sivc and certain portions of it such as
the thinly veiled accusation that the
president is playing domestic politics
in retaining the troops in Mexico may
draw a sharp rebuke.
It is doubtful, according to authori
ties on the correspondence of the
United States, if the government ever
has received a communication couch
ed in as offensive terms and contain
ing as many apparent violations of
the ordinary uses of diplomatic court
esy as this 12,000 word arraignment
of its good faith and honesty of pur
pose.
President Wilson himself will de
cide what course shall.be pursued.
MRS. fMROLL'S WILL.
The will of the late Mrs. Cornelia
McCarroll was probated Thursday.
One half of her estate she bequeathed
to her daughter, Mrs. P. T. Roberts,
of near Gracey, with whom she had
resided for several years, and the
other half of her property is to be di
vided between her two grandchildren,
Harry L. Byers and Mary C. Byers,
of Washington City, this money to be
held in trust for them until they are
twenty-five years old, the Plapters
Bank & Trust Company being named
as trustee. The Planters Bank &
Trust Company is also named as 'ex
ecutor of the will. The instrument
bears date of Sept. 12, 1912.

Binns Bros., A. M. Henry
and R. H. McGaughey
the Hosts.
About 75 farmers, 15 or 20business
men and tho members of the Ken
tucky Tax Commission made up the
party that spent the day Thursday at
Binns' Mill and inspected the fine
farms of the Messrs. Binns, Col. A.
M. Henry and R. H. McGaughey.
The party left in 18 or 20 automo
biles about 10:30 and after a leisurely
drive arrived at the Mill before noon,
Joe Moseley had taken several of
the Tax Commission ahead early and
they were found fishing in the river,
but with poor success.
At noon all repaired to the lawn of
W. C. Binns, where a long table was
spread with everything good to eat.
After dinner speeches were made
by Dr. W. W. Durham, Chas. M,
Meacham, Walter Knight, Dr. S. H,

ry, A. M. Casey and W. C. Binns.

pleasure at having the visitors
guests.

The party then left in the autos to
inspect the clover fields of Mr. Binns,
where they found a magnificent
growth of clover, in some places
three to four feet high, grown on land
that was almost worthless a few years
ago.
The next stop was at Col. - A. M.
Henry's, where the Colonel and his
daughter, Miss Julia and son Arthur,
Jr., served cold drinks to the visitors
in the beautiful lawn. Col. Henry's
lemonade, grape juice, punch and
other iced concoctions added to his
state reputation as a Southern planter
of the school of hospitalitv. His en
tertainment was a duplicate of that
given the Bluegrass visitors last year.
Passing through his farm into that
of R. H. McGaughey, the Iatter's fine
herd of Polled Durhams were looked
over and his splendid farm lands
spected.

GERMANS SHIFT
VERDUN ATTACK
Drive Northwest of Town on
Front of Two Miles Makes
Small Gain.
ITALIANS HOLDING FIRM
Turks Are Making a Better
Showing Against the
Russians.
London, June 2. The Germans
have switched their offensive from
the region of Le Mort Homme north
west of Verdun to the sector between
the Thiamont farm and Vaux north
east of the fortress and have succeed
ed here in entering French first lino
trenches between Fort Douaumont
and the Vaux pond.
The activity of the artillerv on tha
remainder of the front in France also
has lessened in violence. In the Vos
ges mountains near Altkirch the Ger
mans report the occupation of French
positions 350 meters long and about
350 meters deep and the canfure of
prisoners and booty.
The Italians, according to Rome,
continue to hold back attacks by tho
Austrians at various points along tho
Tyrol front.
The Turks, taking the offensive at
three points'in Asia Minor against tho
Russians have temporarily at least
brought the Russian advance toward
Mesopotamia to a standstill.
That the Serbs recently reported as
having landed at Saloniki now are on
the entente allied front on the Greek-
Serbia border is indicated by the lat
est German official communication.
The communication says a weak at
tack made by the entente all the, south
ern'fend of Lake Doiran was repulsed,
and that northeast of the lake, Ser
bians, wearing British uniforms, wero
taken prisoners.
