'inantities of oil on the surfnce ap-1

was full of battle wreckage, showing

of uniforms.
Naval Position Not AfTocted i
The newspapers, while admitting
thai the navy suffered serious losses
In the fight off the Danish coast, de
clare that the engagement has no wise
affected thw naval position of the!
country. In some quarters the belief,
war expressed that the German navy
ntiKht be embolded by the Rritish I
losses to try more raids on a bigger
?cale, but If this result follows it
would unquestionably prove a dis
astrous policy.
The Times suggests that the Hritish
were over confident in their naval
strength.
Heavy Metal Against I-iglit
The naval correspondent of the I
Post explains the outcome of the hat
, tie ir. this fashion:
"German heavy metal got British
light metal at close range and gave it
st-vere punishment. The fight must
have been at close range and the Ger
man battleships, well protected by
tbeir heavy Krupp armor outdistanced
0111 cruisers in a fight for which they
were not suited.
"<iur advance guard, in fact, en
gaged the German guard and the re
sul could not have been otherwise
than serious for the lighter vessels.
But when our main forces came Into J
position for the engagement the Ger- ]
mans had to flee and were driven into!
port.
' There is one thing, however, I
which we have the right to defend in 1
the face of our losses. There must
be no more trifling with the powers 1
of our fleet."
(■crmaiis Badly Scattered
Tha' the German fleet was badly
scattered in its flight is indicated by
the news coming from i'openhag ti. It
was stated In the dispatches that the
German fleet was compelled to sepa
rat< when the more powerful units
of the British fleet got within range
and some of them are still believed to;
he at sea. The possibility was sug- i
gested that elements of the British!
fleet had cut off the escape of some'
of the Herman ships.
Pnofficlal dispatches state that the
engagement lasted from twelve to!
twmty hours and was a running tight.
Haiti Shells on l'iigill\c>
One of the eye witnesses of the bat
tle. Captain Hunt, of the steam
trawler, described how the fleeing Ger
man ships rolled southward at top
speed while the British ships, guided
liy their searchlights, rained shells
aiound the fugitives.
"There were seven big German men
of war In the part of the fleet I saw,"
said Captain Hunt. "It was about
10 46 o'clock on Wednesday night and
the ships were traveling at what I
ret koned to be nearly 30 miles an
hour. The British ships were fol
lowing about :iOO yards behind the
fugitives. The searchlights were
tinned full upon the German ships and !
shells were being poured from every j
gufi. The noise was deafening and the
nun of war were completely enveloped i
by dense clouds of smoke which
rolled from the funnels and from the
busy guns.
So dense was the coal and guu

Not Room Enough For
All Marchers in Chicago
Preparedness Parade
By Associated Press
Chicago, June 3. The great Chi
cago preparedness parade, to which
the entire city devoted itself to-day
started at 9 o'clock.
Marching sixteen abreast, according
lo tabulations by clerks organized for
the purpose, 2,032 paraders passed the
reviewing stand in the first 12 minutes.
It was said that at this rate it was evi
dent that all of the 200,000 persons
who enrolled on the parade books,
could not march, even If the pace set
by the vanguard could he maintained,
unless the demonstrations were con
tinued far into the night.
Throughout the city, homes, business
offices and factories were vivid with
patriotic colors.
All branches of the city's life were
represented. Many women were in
line and heads of Chicago's greatest in
dustries who were not content to ar
range for the appearance of their em
ployes, but insisted on enrolling them
selves. The weather was perfect.
Grant Park, the big downtown play
ground, was black with spectators
when the great line began to stir along
the 3Va miles of Its length.
No accurate estimate of the crowd
was possible. In any event, whatever
their numbers, every bit of space was
taken and nearly everybody carried
fluKB. J
