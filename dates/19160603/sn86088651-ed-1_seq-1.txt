land Wednasdsy, the Gsrmsn losses
included two battleships, one bsttls
cruiser, one light cruiser and aix de
stroyers sunk, two battls cruisers were
dsmaged and three battleships were
hrt. This shows much larger German
losses than were first reported. This
servea as a comfort to the people of
Great Britain somewhat, although ths
British loss apparently remains un
changed. A tug boat arrived at Hook
of, Holland, this morning with eight
of the crew of the Frsuenlob, which
ssnk ten minutes after being struck.'
Nothing of the fate of the remaining!
three hundred members of the crew!
has been learned. Captain William
Hall, chief of the Intelligence dlvls-j
ion of the admiralty, authorized the
Aaaoclated Press to say that the Ger
man report of the loss of the Marl
borough and Warsprlta wss untrue,
and that both ships are safe in har
bor. The "British still control ths
North Sea."
According to catamites made here,
which, In the absence of official fig
ures esn only be conjectural, ths
British losses In men must be some
where In the neighborhood of 5000. A
similar estimste of the German losses
are at Isast between 2000 and 3000
men.
