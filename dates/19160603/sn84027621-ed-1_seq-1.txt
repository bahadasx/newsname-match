SWOPE WILL PREPARE
PLANS FOR THE PARK
Commission Awarded to Landscape
Architect Yesterday by the
'Woman's Club Committee
Harold B. Swope, landscape archi
tect, was yesterday afternoon given
the commission for preparing r plans
for the municipal park on the Taylor
pond property, following the confer
ence with the committee from the
Woman's Club.
Mr. .Swope will make a perspective
drawing, on a large scale, giving a
good idea of how the park will look
when completed. He is very much in
terested in the project, and is anxious
to do all he can to further the good
work. The Woman's Club committee
hopes that the drawing of the plans
will do much to overcome the several
objections, made to the park.
Mr. Swope will leave for Birming
ham, Ala., about June 10, and ex
pects to be in that city on govern
ment work for about two months. Be
fore leaving he will gather what data
he needs, and will prepare the outlay
of the park when he reaches Birming
ham, and as soon as he completes the
drawing he will send it to the wom
an's committee.

CITY COUIICIL DECIDES THAT
ADD MACHINERY ARE
Work on the new light and water 1
plant will proceed. The contract will
be carried out under the supervision
of Twombly & Henney, engineers.
Council in session last nizht gave
further hearing to those who have
been finding fault with the specifica
tions for the plant, and heard the re
plies of" the engineers to the criti
cisms. Mr. David Henney asked the
council for a definite understanding
as to the status, of his firm in the
matter, and he was informed that his
firm would remain in charge.
Criticisms of the De La Vefgne en
gine and other machinery called for
in the specifications, and bitter at
tacks against Twombly ' & Henney,
were made by Mr. H. W. Tucker, who
stated that his only object was to
save the city money. He had no de
sire to persecute anyone, he said. He
opened his attack on Twcmbly &
Henney byhaving the city clerk read
a letter from Thomas' B. Whitted,
who represents one of the engines
turned down by the city, and who
was recently before council making
complaint. The letter stated that the
specifications prepared by Twombly
& Henney had been laughed at by;
reputable engineers. It attacked tha
ability of the city's engineers, saying
that they had never carried to suc
cessful completion any piece of work.
"The city is stuck," the letter said. It
said that if the present plans were
carried out the Camps could afford to
raise their rates for current, - mean
ing that the cost of producing cur
rent in the new plant, as designed,
would . be so much higher. I, It stat
ed that Twombly & Henney had fail
ed on a sewer contract in Brooklyn,
N. Y.
Mr. Tucker told council that he be
lieved that' he could save the city
$21,000. He contended that with the
De La Vergne engine it would cost
the city three and a quarter cents per
K. W. hour to produce current, and
proposed a conference of engineers to
see if this was, or was not true. Mr.
Tucker contended that the bond mon
ey is being used illegally in the erec
tion of the new plant. He said that
the , specifications contained errors,
and that, among other things, a gen
erator and a cooling tower were not
covered in the specifications.
Mr. Henney in reply to the charges
made by Mr. Tucker, stated that his
firm had never had a sewerage con
tract in Brooklyn, and he character
ized the statement in the letter of
Mr. Whitted as a plain lie. The en
gineer then gave council some evi
dence of the ability of Mr. Twombly
and himself. He said that it was but
fair that he do so, in view of the at
tacks. Mr. Alex. Twombly, he said,
was a good electrical engineer and a
good civil ; engineer, . who .for years
was chief engineer for S. D. Warren
& Co., large paper manufacturers.
Mentioning some of the work done by
himself, Mr. Henney told council that
he had prepared the specifications for
the central lighting plant in Wash
ington, which provides current for the
capitol building and grounds, the
congressional library, the House and
Senate oflice buildings, and the su
preme court building. . This, Mr.
Henney said, was a $1,250,000 con-

tract, and his specifications were said
by engineers to be the clearest they
had ever seen. He said that he rep
resented the Westinghouse interests
at the time, and secured for them the
contract for the plant ,after the bids
had been rigidly gone over by a com
mittee of reputable engineers includ
ing Prof. Woodbridge of the Massa
chusetts School of Technology. Mr.
Henney said that he had entire charge
of constructing the terminal and pow
er plant of the Grand Trunk railway,
Ottawa, Canada. He said that he had
handled hundreds of contracts, large
and small, and among them he spoke
of work on the Pennsylvania railroad
terminal in New York, Carnegie Hall
and Roosevelt hospital in that city,
Cornell University buildings, and big
office buildings in Pittsburg. Ocala's
new plant, he said, could be put in one
corner of the coal bunker of the
Washington lighting plant. '
Mr. Henney said that if his firm1
could not get the confidence of coun
cil, it was ready to step out. Nothing
had been left out of the specifications,
he said. The specifications and plans
went together, he said, and should be
so considered.
"The city is absolutely protected in
the whole proposition," said the en
gineer. President Nash asked Mr. Henney

London, June 3. Fulfer . details of
the naval battle emphasize the Ger
man advantage in losses inflicted on
the British while escaping with con
siderable smaller losses themselves.
! The Germans estimate the British
I tonnage destroyed during the battle
at 133,000 tons, with a German loss
! of 23,000 tons. This is probably based
! on the assumption that the British
I warship Warspite, of 27,500 tons, was
! sunk. The British admiralty denies
that this warship was' lost.
MANY BRAVE MEN LOST ON
I BOTH SIDES
j Among the additions to the. vessels
lost is the new German cruiser El-
bing, of between four and five thou
sand tons, and the British destroyer
Shark. The Elbing carried 450 men.1
London dispatches say it is esti
mated that the British lost around
5000 men, the Germans between 2000
and 3000. The "admiralty has been
advised that the entire crew of offi
cers and men of the Queen Mary
were lost.
BRITISH HAD ONLY FOUR BAT
TLESIIIPS None of the accounts show that the
main British fleet was engaged. Four
battleships were supporting a battle
cruiser squadron. These speedy war
ships, it is supposed, attempted to
block the German retreat. This cost
the British the heaviest loss.
AIRSHIPS GAVE GERMANS THE
ADVANTAGE
Zeppelins, acting as scouts, ac

advantage in disposing their forces.

The Germans are continuing their

London, June 3. A Berlin wireless
received here says the German ad
miralty admits the sinking of the
dreadnaught Westfalen, 18,600 tons.
The latest British statement says the
British fleet went out looking for a

does not view the outcome as unfav

are true the German losses in men
nearly matched thr British losses:
ANOTHER BATTLE IMPENDING
An unconfirmed report was circu

warships took refuge in Danish wat

twenty-four hours in which to leave,
and it is reported that a British fleet
is waiting outside for the Germans to
appear.

. ISNT HIS ACT
Senator Bryan is Not the Daddy of
the . Corrupt Practices Law
Lakeland, June 2. Senator Nathan
P. Bryan, who was in this city yes
terday, took occasion to call atten
tion to what he considered an unfair
statement in an editorial in a Tampa
paper deploring the fact that A. J.
Angle's name had been left off the
ballot and laying this fact to the
"primary law."
Senator Bryan is generally known
as the author of the primary law but
it is one of , the requirements of the
Trammell "corrupt practices" act that
caused Angle's name to be left off the
ticket. With that law Senator Bryan
had no connection and he takes excep
tion to the charge that Angle's name
was not put on the ballot through the
workings of the primary law.
"It was due to the corrupt practices
act that Mr. Angle's name did not get
on the ballot," said he. "Not to any
cause of the primary law. Any effort
to shift responsibility on me for the
details of the corrupt practices act is
unfair and unjust."
