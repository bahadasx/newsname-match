out tir lati i bank scheme on

Gardner are circulating a good

THE KICKER TAKES A REST.
While I haven't said anything about it. yet I have been in a pretty had
shape for several months. Along about Christmas I was just about 'all in."
The four years tight against a pack of office-holders ami lawyers, backed by
landlords, bankers and the "Holy Fathers1 in a court where I KNEW I had
DO chance, proved too much for my strength although 1 thought 1 could
stand anything. But age will tell.
In a battle of brains I would have welcomed them singly or collectively.
But they wanted none (f that. It suited them belt to apply their ''Law. "
In December I went to a doctor, and his verdict was that 1 must have com
plete rest. That was impossible without suspending the paper. However, 1
followed his advise as near as I could, and am slowly improving.
For the purpose of giving myself a complete rest for a month. 1 have de
cided to suspend publication of the Kicker during June, and my readers will
receive instead the Cape (rirardeau Weekly Tribune one of the heT edited
papers in Southeast Missouri.
The next issue of the Kicker will appear the first week in July. !oi res
pondents will please make a note of this anil also take a vacation.

IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.
There is a wh i i it of differ
ence between strutting ii:oui
home in an army uniform and be
ing on the firing line. There i
also u dlff rence between tic
pictures ,oi see i" the postoffl-
s and actual service, When a
(.'IBS? strike. a colllinui'it.v t"
'organise a company" many s ick
era are caught by the glitter of
brass buttons. But when the call
comes Tor action, then it Isdlffer-
cut.
a few years ago Ilkeston hud a
lot of tin soldiers, Some juke,
sent a telegram there ror them
to get ready tor service on the
Mexican border, The patriots
toi.k tu tic tall timber -hard to
catch,
It always gives nn- the --irig-iries"
wheu the yaps who follow
their old party lenders get bump
ed In Texas all of the substan
tial citizens are Democrats, And
th" Babes take their Ideas from
the better class. Hence they felt
it their duty to be particularly
patriotic while Wilson is presi
dent and many Joined the Nation
al Guards thinking there would
be nothing to do b it parade and
show off,
Recently the governor of Texas
called on these patriots to do
patrol duty along the Mexican
border, That was different. The
yaps hadn't thouirlit of anything
like that and nruiv refused togo,
Now they are to ie court mar

Some fa teen years ago a lnv
was slipped tnroiigh rumrress
was slipped through congress,
known as the Dick military law.
that makes ever.i able-bodied
mate citizen Dei ween tic aires :
is and .5, subject to the call of
the president for military duty
We are to',.i that this is a gov
ernment of and by the people
et even today not one person In
flft.t knows anything about this
Dick law, Il there Ls any differ
ence between it and what Is
known as conscription, 1 can't
discover it
But the patriots of Tois are
soon to learn something about it
it seems that the Texas call was
by the president through the gov
ernor. These patriots thought
they were only In the State ser
vice, and did not know that the
were subject to the call of tl'
president If the newspapers had
told u of this UicK law instead of
so much about the tariff and
other bunk, the people might
have become aroused and forced
its repeal
What happened in Texas also
happened In other states along
the border New Mexico and Ari
zona. Concerning the Texas af
fair Secretary of war Baiter gave
out the following statement:
"The Dick bill, not being repeal
ed, expressly, remains in force
The llfl nieu In question, having
taken an oath to preserve the
constitution of the United States
and obey the lawful orders of the
governor ol Texas, ami not hav
ing vet taken an oath to obey tic
president us commander In chief,
must still present themselves for
muster. They are capable, there
fore, of committing the offense In
the Dick bill and are, therefore,
liable to punishment
"I have decided to have the
court martial assembled by ooin
maud of the president, and have
asked den, Funs ton to recommend
the members thereof.
while I shall not prescribe, i
shall bt Inclined to recommend
that the proceedings be abated in
cases where the men arc willing
to take the oath."
As 1 understand this. the
Guardsmen have sworn to pre
serve the constitution and obey
their governor, but not the pres
ident. They can now take their
choice swear to obey the presi
dent or take the consequences.
It js quite a flop from the
"anti-imperialist" campaign of
the Democrats 12 years ago aud
their militaristic campaign of to
day. Do you remember those
cartoons the Donk paper! carried,
picturing Roosevelt with cannons
sticking out of his eyes ears and
mouth'.'
The earth belongs to all the
people. Why should 00 per cent
of us pay rent to live upon it?
