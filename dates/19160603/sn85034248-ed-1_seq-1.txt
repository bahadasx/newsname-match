Colonel Hargraves, a well known
SPortsmran is found dead in the rear
iCradelbaugh's, a notorious gam
ling house. Murgatroyd, the dis
tiict attorney, learns from Pemmican
manager of the gambling house, that
J. Lawrence Challoner, a well-known
society man, did the shooting. Chal
loner flees and takes a room in a
cheap lodging house. His wife pleads
with him to give himself up. She is
wealthy in her own right, and has
lavished money on her husband,
Challoner is finally arrested and
in ought- to trial.
A maid testifies that the murdered
man and Challoner were both in love
with Letty Love, and had quarrelled
over her. Pemmican's story clinches
the accusation and proof. Challonei's
wife has given the district attorney
half a million dollars--all the money
she has-as a bribe to free her hus
band. Instead Murgatroyd prosecutes
Challoner and gets a confession from
him. Mr.s. Challoner denounces Mur
gatroyd and tells of the bribe. He
stands on his record as securing the
prosecution and her story is discred
ited. Mrs. Challoner calls on DMur
gatroyd after the conviction and
scores him for not keeping his word.
\lurgatroyd says he promised to save
Challoner, but did not say when.
She gains new hope.
Later PerNmican gets shot in a row
with two crooks, .Before he dies he
makes a confession to Murgatroyd
that he killed Hargraves, He says
Letty Love was his wife, and that he
hated both Hargraves and Challoner.
They were both in the gambling
louse where they quarrelled, and later
Challoner became so intoxicated that
he lost his senses. Pemmican said he
then decided to kill Hargraves, blame
it upon Challoner, and in this way get
rid of both men. Besides, Hargraves
lad ten thousand dollars in cash on
nis person, which Pemmican took.
Murgatroyd sees Challoner and tells
'mim he has obtained a fake confes

snd tells him to drop out of sight.
irs. Challoner is happy and thinks
ter money has bought her husband's

that he is to be a father and it makes

Challoner bought her husband's

;penny of the fortune, but took the
money because he knew it was the
only way to make a man of Challoner

Pauline Frederick in Emotional Role.
Pauline Frederick, the distinguish
ed emotional actress who has won in
ternational fame by her admirable
screen interpretations of "Zaza" and
"Bella Donna," adds another remark
able characterization to her list of
successes in the thrilling picturization
iof Henry Arthur Jones' powerful
drama. "'Lydia Gilmore," which comes
to the Grand Monday. In this famous
emotional role, Miss Frederick sug
.gests with infinite strength and pathos
the faithful wife and devoted mother
who suffers indescribable mental
agony to shield her husband's name
and save his life after he has been
proven to be faithless to her and the
murderer of the man whose home he
had violated.
The intense struggle she exerts
in her great mother-love to save her
son from going through life with the
brand of Cain. is one of the most vital
Iand tender dramatic episodes ever
witnessed on the screen. "Lydia Gil
more" strengthens the position Miss
Frederick has already established as
the foremost emotional artiste of the
stage and screen.
Notable Cast in "A Parisian
Romance."
A cast of exceptional merit is seen
in the William Fox production of the
Richard Mansfield version of "A
Parisian Romance," starring H.
Cooper Clilffe and Dorothy Green,
which will be shown at the Grand
Tuesday. Mr. Cliffe is the well-known
English a~tor, and Miess Green is a
photoplay favorite of national re
nown.
the original manuscript of the fa
lmoos stage success was unearthed,
and this and Mr. Mansfield's personal
notations in connection with the play
were followed as much as possible.
While there has necessarily been
some deviation from the stage ver
sion of the production, the sumptu
ousness that marked the presentation
or the legitimate sutage has been faith
fully adhe:red to in the photoplay.
Geraldine Farrar in "Temptation."
The appearance qf Gertaldine Farrat
in another photoplay production by
the Lasky Company, following her
great success in the screen version of
"Carmen," is an announcement that
will create intense interest among lo
cal motion picture patrons. Miss
Far'ar's next production is entitled
"Temptation." and it will be the at
traction at the Grand next Wednes
day.
"Temptation" will reveal Geraldine
Farratr for one of the few times in her
artistic carier in a moidern role
with a present-day dramatic theme.
hi'ie story of the play concerns the
triils and hardiships endured by a
young Americian girl to obtain a hear
ing before grand opera audiences.
On this account it will not he easy to
entirely disassociate the star and in
cidents of "Temptation" from some of
the prima donna's own personal ap
pearances in her climb to the top of
the operatic professiun. A glimpse
is had of life back of the scenes in a
big opera company.
Among those who appear ill sup
port of the stiar are Theodore Roberts,
Pedro de Cordloa, Raymond Halton
and Elsie Jane Wilson.
Pearl White as "Hazel Kirke."
"Hnasel Kitrke'_." a Pathe G;ol
Rooster feature adapted from the im
mortal American classic of the same
name which has delighted theatre
goers for more than thirty years, is
booked for presentation at the Grand
next Thursday. Pearl White in the
title role finds an opportunity for seri
ous expression denied her in the past.
As "Hazel" she is always convincing
and does perhaps the best work of her
career. Bruce McRae, whose art has
been ri5pened by years of starring on
the legitimate stage, is an ideal
"'Squire Rodney." William Riley
Hatch as "Dunstan Kirke" ably por
trays the stern, yet loving, old miller.
Allen Murnane, a most excellent
actor, is worthy of mention, as are al
so Creighton Hale and Florence Ed
ney. This Gold Rooster play is de
serving of being ranked as one of the
best features of the vear,
"Undine" in Beautiful Photoplay.
Among the most attractive plhoo
plays relenaed I ecently is "Uldine,'
a spectacular H]ue Bitrd production
inspired by the famous fairy tale of
the same title, which will be the
attraction at the Grand Friday of
next week, the 9th inst.
Berthelda, daughter of a fisher
man, is stolen, and left to roam in
the enchanted forest where she is dis
covered by the duke and duchess, who
adopt her as their own child.
Because her mother had committed
the sin of falling in love with a mor
tal, Undine, the child of the sinful
communication, is sent to earth by
Queen Unda to atone for her moth
er's errors. Undine is found on the
beach by the fisherman's wife, who
quickly accepts her as a gift from
heaven to replace their own child who
had been stolen.
Fifteen years pass. Huldbrand,
a brave knight, in love with Lady
Berthelda, is sent to the enchanted
forest to explore its mysteries and re
turn to the castle to receive his re
ward--Lady ierthelda's hand. liHe
comes to the fisherman's cottage,
meets Undine, falls quickly in love
with bet and is married by a ship
wrecked priest, whom Undine has
rescued from the sea.
Rejoicing in his new happiness,
Huldbrand takes Undine to the castle.
Amidst the ceremonies of rejoicitig a
messenger from Queen Unda appears,
tells Undine that her mission on earth
is complete, and Undine returns to
fairyland. Then Huldbrand and Lady
Berthelda renew their tiroth and the
story ends.

SNATURAL RICHES OF LOUISIANA
Splendid Exposition of Resources in
Conservation Commission Report.
A record of progress and achieve
ment, and a thorough exposition of
the natural assets of one of the rich
est states in the American Union, is
the biennial report of the Conserva
tion Commission of Louisiana, a copy
of which has just been received by
the editor of this paper.
The report is excellently arranged
and printed, and would prove invalu
able as a supplementary reader in the
public schools of the state. Every
man and woman interested in the ad
vancement of Louisiana should have
a copy. It is splendidly illustrated,
a feature of especial interest being
many exceptional photographs of
wild bird and animal life taken in
their haunts.
Each of the various departments
of the commission is represented by
a report written by its respective
head. The articles show that the
commission has lived up to its duties
by not only guarding the natural re
sources of the state, but by upbuild
ing them for the profit of the people.
The conservation of game biruds,
song birds, and insectivorous birds is
reviewed by Stanley Clisby Arthur,
ornithologist of the commission; the
report of the activities on the state
game farm is written by E. A. Mc
lihenny; the work being accomplish
ed on the Urania forest preserve is
described by Henry E. Hardtner;
what is being done in the great oil
and gas fields of Louisiana is report
ed by J. W. Smith; a review of the
oyster industry is from the pen of
Frank T. P:ayne; the work of the
fisheries department is outlined by E.
A. Tulian. superintendent; Dr. Robert
N. Coker reviews the fresh water
mussel resources of Lousiana; while
other parts of the report deal with
the fur-bearing animal industry, the
introduction of elk into the state, the
educational work pursued by the com
mission, its financial report, and
other matters.
President Alexander is not only to
be congratulated for the energy he
has expended in bringing Louisiana
to the front in the matter of conser
vation, but he is to be commended for
not making his report of the work
accomplished a mass of dry figures,
the fault of so many reports of this
nature. The document makes enter
taining and instructive reading.
Copies of the report may be chb
tained free of charge upon applica
tion to the conservation commission,
as long as the limited supply lasts.

POVERTY AND TUBERCULOSIS.
Economic Conditions a Factor in;
Spread of Great White Plague,
Poverty and tuberculosis---tucbe_
culosis and poverty! These are the
essential facts which force themselves
to the attention of every investigator
who faces the problem of that disease.
The tenement house district of Cin
cinnati yields a tuberculosis morbid.
ity just three times as great as the.
areas where better housing prevails.
In 197 families in which tuberculosis
existed the average monthly income
for a family of four was approximat
ly $57. After paying the pro. rata
share for food and kent, a balance of
$5.13 'remained fo; each indiiduiual to
meet all other expenses. Such a lotw
subsistence level works like black
magic in the spread of tuberculosis.
Moreoverx, and this is a point whichi
the public should 'ponder, the home
of the average wage earner was found
to be far less sanitary than the aver.
age factory and wworkshop. In re
gard to all the factors whwch make for
healthful living, ventilation, suficient
ligJt, proper temperature, a'rd free
dorm from overcrowding, the score
xwas in favor of the factory in nearly
every in:tance.
The city of Cincinnati realized tiat
her tuberculosis death rate wasx iv,
per cent above the average and that
it had failed to manifest a tendency
to decline. She felt no qualms in
making this admission. Rather, she ,
determined that she would learn why,
with an efficient health department
and favor-able climatic influences, she I
was suffering from twice the mortal
ity from that disease as her neighbor,
Pittsburg. Accordhingly the United
States Public Health Service was re
quested to make a thorough study of
the situation and submit a report. To 1
show that something more than mere I
academic interest obtained, 19,939
workers in 154 fagtories of the city
'oluntarily submitted to a physical 1
examination.
The conclusions 'reached point di
rectly to the close connection between
poverty and tuberculosis. The great
factor underlying the entire problem
was Seemingly that of economic con
ditions. One-sixth Of all tuberculosis
cases came from cheap lodging houses.
Alcoholism was a prominent cause,
and often accelerate the course of
the disease. Occupational hazards
and bad working c9itions were ap
parently responsibl' r about 20 per
cent of the cases, b. In the majority
of instances these haards were not
necessarily inherent in the occupa
tion. Previous tub.t ulosis in the
family occurred in eictically a third
of all the cases ifeatigated. Dis
sipation, overcro ) ousing,
and ina 1'i; y ponsi
bility, were also lit s caus.es
An interesting feature of the re
port, and one which-has not previous
ly been dwelt upon i. studies of this
:ha~acter, relates, to the effect of im
migration and the rite of growth of
the population of a city upanr the tu
beeculosis death rate. It is shown
that cities with a population com
po: ed largely of racial stock haying a
.mitaed resistance to tuberculosis are
subject to a high mortality rate from
that disease, while centers having a
siow rate of population increase are
likewise subject to a high tuberculosis
late. The evidence is submitted in
a comparative table covering sixteen
American cities. Almost without ex
ception those with a high percentage
of Irish, Scandinavian and German
stock, and those in which the negro
population is relatively large, have a
correspondingly high mortality, while
those where the tlalian and Jewish ele
ment is proportionately great have a
low tuberculosis death rate. Similar
ly, such cities as Detroit and Cleve
land, with high rates of population
increase, show a low tubereulosis
mortality, while Cincinnati and Balti
more, with a relatively small popula
tion increase, have a high tuberculosis
rate. Doubtless the true explanation
of this discrepancy is that advanced
by the authors, namely, that where
he population increase is rapid new
buildings are erected to take the place
,f old insanitary structures and bet
ter housing conditions prevail.

At Philadelphia ii 1872 this resolu

"The Republitan party, mindful ofL
Iits obligations to the loyal women.of
Snimerica, expresses gratification that
wider avenues of enmployment have
been opened to woman, and it turther
declares that her demand for addi

Again in 187i; the ationld con

the following: "The Republicean

At the St. Louis convoatition in 1896
the following plank was inserted:
