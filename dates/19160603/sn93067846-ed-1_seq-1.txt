Thla Is the first time In the hlatory

FREIGHT RATES UKGHAMfiEO.
RAILROAD COMMISSION DISMISS?
ES PETITION. ,
At Hearing Yesterday Transportation
Companies Sought Elimination of
Exception Sheet for Southern Class,
location. .
Columbia, May 51.?Following a
hearing yesterday the South Carolina
railroad commission refused to elim?
inate the exception sheet frfm this
State, as petitioned by six transporta?
tion companies in the State,jfor the
purpose of substituting the Southern
j classification. An effort ,to get the
representatives of transporting and
shipping interests to agree on cer?
tain items on the sheet was fstile. ?
The hearing was opened ifrtth a
statement that the elimination, of the
entire exception sheet wouid?not be
I discussed. - Subsequently resolutions
were offered by the South Carolina
I Freight Rate association to have a
I committee appointed to confer on the
elimination of certain items, holh
jsides to abide by the findings and
I recommendations of this committee
upon their conllrmation by this com ?
mission.
The fight by the transoertaUon
companies was headed by L. 1& Chal
oner of Norfolk, feright traffic man?
ager of the Seaboard Air tiim\ rail?
way, who said that the ^f?road3
wot Id notify the commission Iper if
they decided to take further stftpa.
The main point that the sappers
{and carriers were unable fco;:fet to
I getter on, It seemed, was t,he time In
whioh the items of the exception sheet
was to be considered. The transpor
tatlc n officials wanted to give consul -
erat on to the matter Immediately,
while the shipping interests c wanted
further time for consideraUo#; also
they wanted the carriers to, fubmlt
to them In writing the Itejj^r" they
wanted to eliminate, and thejjjfj^riers
would not agree to this. fj
The transportation officiaU,?<?igh
their spokesman, Mr. Chalotj^Vemld
that the railroads ?*d not
South Carolina, their only idea In re?
questing the elimination of the excep?
tion aheet was to secure a greater
uniformity of rates and a simplifica?
tion of tariff in the various States.
Charles Klmmick, commissioner of
I the Charleston Chamber of Com?
merce, said that on the face of Mr.
Chalo tier's plea the theory of uni?
formity of rates was all right but is
its practical application it was not
so attractive. He claimed that Indi?
vidual States, acting independently,
could not effect this uniformity, that
there would be differences, and for
the proposition of Mr. Chaloner to be
accepted would mean that South
Carolina would start a movement at
its own expense.

THE WATERWAYS BUI PASSED
MEASURE APPROPRIATING $43,
000,000 ADOPTED BY VOTE OF
35 TO 32.
Determined Filibuster by Kenyon and
Sherman Brought to an End?Till
man Unable to Vote.
Washington, May 29.?After a pe
sistont fight, lasting for three weeks,
the senate today passed the rivers and
harbors appropriation bill carrying
approximately $43,000,000, by a vote
of 35 to 32.
The bill, which has been under con?
stant debate in the senate for three
weeks, will now go to a conference of
the two houses. The fight against it,
begun by Senator Kenyon of Iowa and
Senator Sherman of Illinois, gained
strength until the final effort to dis?
place it with a bill appropriating a
I lump of 130,000,000 was defeated to
| day by only one vote.
Senators Till man of South Carolina
and Thomas of Colorado (Democrats)
sought to vote against it, but could not
transfer their pairs, and thus were
prevented from voting.
Just before the final vote was taken
Senator Kenyon predicted it would be
the last of its kind to pass an Ameri?
can congress.
"You are voting at least $20,000,000
into this bill that is absolutely unjus?
tifiable," said Senator Kenyon.
'You had an opportunity to correct
some of this abuses, but you would
not. Your motto is, 'Let the people
squeal.' Some day a congress will be
here which will not consider that the
greatest statesman is the man who
can get the greatest amount of money
out of the federal treasury.
"It is a pity that the whole blame
for this extravagance must rest on the
Democratic party because the bill
never could be passed without Repub?
lican votes. There are patriotic
statesmen on the Democratic side of
the chamber, too, who fought hard
for economy in this legislation."
Shortly before the bill was placed
I upon its passage, the NewlanXhV
mteno^eht lto cfeate 'a naHajm1*w**
fter; commission was stricken from the
bill on the renewed point of order
made by Senator Gallinger.
The bill as it pased the house car?
ried approximately $40,000,000. Chief
among the senate additions was
$1,800,000 for a diverting dam In the
harbors at Los Angeles and Long
Beach, Cal.; $220,000 for the harbor
at San Diego, Cal., and $360,000 for a
turning basin in the harbors of Dulutb
and Superior on Lake Superior.
An appropriation for $200,000 for
deepening East river, New York, the
only new project inserted in the bill
by the house, and stricken out by the
senate committee, later was restored
in the senate. It was urged by the
president and the secretary of the
navy as an imperative preparedness
measure in order to provide a chan?
nel for battleships to the navy yard at
Brooklyn.
Senator Newlands' amendment to
create a rivers and harbors commis?
sion, which was adopted but later
stricken out on a point of order, pro?
posed a commission of the secretaries
of war, interior, agriculture and com?
merce and the chairmen of the house
and senate committees interested in
the framing of waterways improve?
ment legislation to cooperate with
the board of army engineers in in?
vestigating the whole subject of wa?
terways. It was adopted without a
roll call, and with the approval of
Chairman Clarke of the commerce
committee. The amendment, which
proposed an appropriation of $500,
000, was made the subject of a point
of order after Senator Stone had
made a similar objection to an
amendment by Senator Kenyon pro?
posing a permanent commission to
deal with the waterways problem.
Senator Stone refused to withdraw his
point of order at the request of Sena?
tor Gallinger and the latter then in?
sisted on his point against the New
lands' amendment.

al Is considered certain.

/
MA . ITY LEADER THINKS IT
S LESSER EVIL.
6 -
I w a Begins Consideration of Mens
? e Under Five Minute Rule, to
3 lose This Week.
Washington, May 29.?Majority
eader Kitchin made his promised
speech in behalf of the naval appro?
priation bill in the house today, ex?
plaining that while he believed the
measure provided for greater prepar?
edness on sea than the country really
needed he was supporting it because
it eliminated the navy department's
five year building programme. He de?
voted himself most vigorously to at?
tacking the socalled big navy men,
asserting that the present clamor for
preparedness was due in the main to
hysteria and jingoism.
In opposing the five year programme
Mr. Kitchin said it woutd be foolish
to contract for ships at present high
prices when it was probable that the
cost of materials would be much lower
after the war.
General debate closed with Mr.
Kitchin's speech and the house then
began consideration of the bill under
the rule permitting five minute
speeches on amendments. This
probably will be continued until' 4
o'clock Friday afternoon, the hour
set for the final vote. The house re?
mained in session until late tonight
and the leaders agreed to meet to?
morrow at the usual hour instead of
recessing over Memorial day
Representatives Farr of Pennsyl?
vania, Britten of Illinois and Roberta
of Massachusetts spoke during the day
for the minority with Its larger build?
ing programme, including two dread?
noughts and six battlecruisers instead
of the five battlecruisers provided for
in the bill Mr. Farr drew applause
from the galleries in declaring In fa?
vor of building 25 capital ships, 260
submarines and many all
Representative Britten
the bill as Munsctentlnc. unl
A score of amendments.
I the close of general debate were
promptly voted down.
