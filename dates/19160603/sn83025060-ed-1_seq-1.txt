REGISTRATION LAW UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
Oklahoma City .Judge, so Holds in
Granting Injunction Against
State.
REPUBLICANS WIN
Restrains Commissioner From Paying
Claims for Registration f
' Printing
Oklahoma City, May 27. Holding
that the new Oklahoma registration
law is unconstitutional District J.udge
Oldflcld this evening granted an 'in
junction asked byAj'thur H. Geidsler,
chairman of the republican state cen
tral committee. Attorneys represent
ing the state served notice that they
would take an appeal to the supreme
court. Everything will be done to
get a decision from the supreme court
at the earliest possible time.
'.. Restrains Officials.
' The injunction sought by Mr. Geiss
Jer would restrain the county commis
sioners from paying claims for print
ing blanks that were used in the reg-
"tration of voters under the new law.
The state contended that the proper
method for testing the validity of the
law was for some voter who had been
i jnicd registration to bring the pro-
codings: that the injunction to prc-
ont payment of any claim under the
1 iv was not the proper way.
The above is only a starter. Wo
must now get in the U. S. Court with
:.n injunction and put a stop to the
rascals for all time.
It will take some money to do this.
We must work as well as pray. Let
every loyal Negro get busy and raise
his share. Do it now. It will and must
1 e filed before July. Every man,
whether he can read or not, is entitled
to vote.
We understand our old friend, Bert
Chandler, of Vinita, will be a candi
date for Congress in the 1st district.
He is an old-timer and we wish him
well.
We are for Theodore Roosevelt as
the Republican party nominee for the
presidency. Wo have been at all times
heretofore classed with that body ,of
Republicans known as "standpatters."
We have been content to be so classed
because wo aro rigidly in favor of
party regularity, and because we are
of that old orthodox type of Repub
lican who subscribed to the party faith
on the principal that "the Republican
party is the ship, all else is the sea."
we could not lollow Mr. Roosevelt
outside of, and away from, the Repub
lican party 'in 1912, his previous in-'
valuable service to the party and to
the country and his famous Armaged
don speech notwithstanding. How
ever, we see no good sense in refusing
to stand with him now for the nomin
ation at Chicago. He has wisely le
turned to the fold and we welcome
him with a fervor no less ardent than
the reception given the "prodigal son."
Whether he was or was not right
in his action of 1912 is obviously be
side the question. The fact is that
ho has returned; and he has brought
with him personality, honesty of pur
pose and the width and depth of the
safe and profound statesman, all of
which he offers to contribute to tho
party just as unstintingly as ho has
contributed it in the past. No party
would turn its back to a man possess
ed of such enviable virtues. Indeed,
any party or any nation imbued with
clean, lofty, true and un-wavpring
governmental ideals, would delight in
pointing to him as an outgrowth and
a product of those very ideals in evi
dence of tho seeds it had sown in" tho
hearts and souls of it3 citizenship.
We arc for Roosevelt because we be
lieve that his nomination will solidify
the party as nothing else can do; we
arc for him because his country is
calling to him to become its chief ex
ecutive; we are for him because he is
closer to the hearts of the people of
this nation and represents more near
ly their tiaditions, their hopes and
their ambitions, than any other man in
the public eye. In a word, he is the
personified idea of the masses as to
what should bo the political, econom
ical, international and industrial aims
and activities of our commonwealth.
He stands for preparedness not mere
ly as a matter of national defense, but
as well for the preservation of our
sacred right of neutrality. His nom
ination and election would assure to
is a preparedness to combat any in
'lucncc that might take from us our
opportunity to realize upon our ho.i-
3st toil, capital and skill, a prepaiel
ness
that will turn the deficit in our
national trsasury into a balance. anJ
that will nuturc, develop and quicken
an industrial scheme that will once
more start all classes in this country
upon the high road of prospciity.
He stands lor the right of our mer
chant marine and our nationals to
travel upon the high seas without vio
lation of property or person. He
stands ior each and every right due
us in our relationship and dealings
with foreign powers, and his com
prehensive insight and broad perspec
tive on international precedents, gain
ed from a wealth of experience, to
gether with his undoubted courage,
evenly poised and balanced at all times
by hard common sense, will reclaim us
from tho labyrynth of ridicule, jest
and cmbamissment, into which tho
voluble and gullible diplomacy of the
present administration has carried us.
As to7Justice Hughes, he i3 but a
student of Mr. Roosevelt. Why should
we not demand the instructor in the
first instance? And too, Justice
Hughes can no doubt best serve his
country in his present position. In
that position he has been tried and in
it has shown his ability. It may be
that his judicial temperament and
training would be a liability to him
rather than an asset, as the chief ex
ecutive of the nation. With him as
the standard bearer we must hazard
all this, and more. It is the misfor
tune of the Hughes enthusiasts that
Mr. Roosevelt has been tried as Pres
ident. Let Justice Hughes remain
where he is. In this day of reckless
and rampant "judicial legislation"
the risk is entirely too great for the
Republican party to make it possible
for President Wilson, surrounded as
ne is oy piace-nunting and weak ad
visers, to make an appointment to the
bench of the United States Supreme
Court.
Just as the nation as in travail,
groaned under consciousness of the
horrors and inhumanity of tho insti
tution of chattle slavery, and brought
forth Abraham Lincoln to abolish it
forever here, it is now, writhing in the
pains of lowered national dignity, silly
legislation, lessened opportunities,
ccopomlcal and industrial depredations
brings forth Theodore Roosevelt to
stamp from our national life these
drawbacks and impediments. Give us
Roosevelt in this our dark hour that
light may take the place of this dark
ness and that we may rejoice once
more in the prosperity, stability and
progressiveness of our beloved land.
Rev. S. C. Doyle of Clarksville, Okla.

Colonel Roosevelt and no "pussy
footing "
The Tribune likes this candidate and
this issue.
It regards Senator Root, its favorite
so long as he had a chance of nomina
tion, as now practically eliminate!. It
cannot interpret any more hopefully
the failure of the "oxygen treatment"
which his candidacy received, in the
ihapc of the manifesto with scventy
Ive signers. The party thinks that
Air. Root would not be so likely to win
is either Colonel Roosevelt or Justice
Hughes, and it wants him as Secre
tary of State in the next Republican
idministration, since it cannot have
him as President.
We are for Colonel Roosevelt bo
cause we believe the country needs
him. No one else will quicken the
pulse of the nation as he will quicken
it. No one else will stir the conscience
of the people as he will stir it. No one
else will inspire patriotism as he will
inspire it.
No one else personifies the issue
which the Republican party must make
as he personifies it. No one else pre
sents so effective an antithesis to Wil-
Json as he. If we are Americans, real
Americans, tne uoionei is our man.
While timid politicians were consult
ing the census books and counting the
German vote he spoke and the country
hearkened. He is the leader in tho
fight for Americanism, and wo don't
believe in changing leaders when we
are going to the front.
We are for Colonel Roosevelt in
spite of the'fact that we were against
him- four years ago, No one fought
him harder than we. No one will fight
harder for him. It has not been easy
to put. aside our pride, our sense of
resentment at what occurred in 1912,
and tho hundred other things that tend
to keep alive divisions. But we have
put them asido and arc putting them
aside because we fool that they have
no place in a crisis like this. We come
ouf for Colonel Roosevelt as a Re
publican newspaper, intending to re
main Republican, and we feel that in
doing so wo are doing the best thing
not only for the nation but' for the
Republican party.
We might have preferred another
leader, but there is no other leader.

ho had been free to speak. Indeed, wo
feel suro he would havo spoken, and
for Americanism, had silence not been
imposed upon him, and then we should
have preferred him. But the plain
fact is that he did not speak, that ho
could not speak.
If the Justice should be chosen lead
er in the fight for a worthier national
ism, he would havo to take the torch
that Colonel Roosevelt has thus far
issue that meant its most only in an
bore. Ho would have to accept an
othre man's hands. Surely in the
transfer wo should lose our stride. As
a people we should feel that wo had
hung back, that wo hadn't "gone tho
limit" in the true American way. Tho
governments of Europe would feel
this, too. They would conclude that
wo meant to temporize. Something
would be lost of the moral effect of
movqing straight on under the leader
ship of the man who represents tljo
does or can.
Tho Colonel stands for the things
The Tribune stands for. These things
will bo advanced more by his nomina
tion than by any other nomination that
can be made. The Tribune must sup
port him.
We arc doing more this year than
choosing a new President. Wc aro
I choosing which way the country shall
go in mo era mat is now opening,
just ns our fathers chose the na
tion's path in the days of 18G0. N.
Y. Tribune.
The cowards at Waco, Texas, havo
had their picnic with the lynching of
a poor innocent dcfensless colored boy.
What thoy havo sown they will reap
and in the near future; the High
Sheriff in hell will hold a soiree with
tho infernal cowards from Waco,
Texas, as chwf actors in the drama.
Wo can't understand where tho loyal
race loving patriots were when this
outrage was being porpotratcd. If
three brave men had stood for law
and order the outrage would havo
never been committed as the cowardly
mob could havo been dispersed when
hot lead was thrown into their ranks.
The only way to fight tho devil is with
fire and wo mako this suggestion to
our brothers in Texas. (Hell.)
