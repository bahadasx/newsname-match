According to Information collected
from various sources, the greatest loss
of life was in the day coach, which
toppled on its side under ten feet of
water. Wreckers now are attempting
to raise the car and it is feared many
more 'dead will be found inside. A
list of missing has not been compiled
but the conductor of the train esti
mated that there were fifteen persons
on the train at the time of the accident
who have not been heard from.
According to railroad officials the
bridge supports were weakened by
the high water and they collapsed un
der the weight of the train.
All the dead and injured were pas
sengers. The train crew escaped in
Jury.
The wreck was due to high water
which had so undermined the bridge
supports that when the train struck
the bridge the entire structure col
lapsed. The engine plunged Into the
creek carrying with it the baggage car,
smoker and day coach. The bodies
were recovered from the day coach,
and the missing were riding in the
6moker, and, it is feared, were drown
ed. Members of the train crew
escaped with minor bruises. They
cooperated with citizens of this town
in rescuing dazed and frantic sur
vivors.
When the train turned over, many of
Mbe
passengers succeeded in breaking
"the windows of the coaches and crawl
ing onto the sides of the cars, where
they remained until taken off by
rescuers in boats. Several are under
doctors' care, due to exposure.

IS REAL DISASTER
THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR8 WORTH
OF 8TOCK DROWNED AND
MUCH DAMAGE DONE.
McGregor, June 2.—More than $10,
000 worth of stock was lost in a storm
that reached the proportions of a
cloudburst here last evening. The
water flooded stock pens in the rail
road yards, drowning hundreds of cat
tle. Great damage was done in the
business section of the city. Ground
floors and basements of buildings were
flooded. Few business houses escap
ed damage. The loss to James F. Lee,
a Dubuque contractor, who has been
working on a $46,000 paving contract
here, amounts to about $10,000. Al
together, the storm did about $60,000
damage here. Water was up to the
tops of the tables in the dining room
of the McGregor hotel.
PROPERTY L088 HEAVY.
Deborah, June 2.—About $25,000
damage was done by a severe rain and
wind storm here last night. Two
bridges over the upper Iowa river in
this city, two bridges near here on the
Milwaukee railroad and another on the
Rock Island, about two miles out of
town, were washed away. Traffic over
these lines, it is believed, will not be
resumed for more than a week. No
lives were lost.
The home of Louis Stokops was in
the path of a torrent of water that
rushed through the city. It was car
ried a distance of three blocks, with
the terrified members of the family
remaining in the building as it was
carried along. The house remained
upright and no one was hurt.
Hundreds of hogs and chickens were
drowned. The carcasses were strewn
about today.
PENSION MIS (BUSED
Army Officers Take 8teps to Guard
Against Frauds Such as Have Been
Practiced In the Past.
Washington, D. C., June 2.—Steps
were taken by army officers today to
guard against penBion claims for dis
abilities not incident to military serv
ice. Army medical officers were in
structed through a bulletin issued /by
the chief of staff to examine recruits
with special care, even though they
are enlisted from Btate militia organ
izations whose medical standards are
equal to those of the United States
army.
The circular cites the fact that thou
sands of claims for pensions based on
physical defects possessed at the time
of enlistment have been filed in pa6t
years, because careful physiclal re
ports on recruits were not kept.
TRAIIING COSTS
BORNE BY FRUIT CO.
New York, June 2.—The United
Fruit Co., its employes learned today,
has offered to grant any man in its
service who wishes to attend a mili
tary training camp this summer not
only four weeks' vacation with full
pay but an expense allowance of $76.
More than 800 corporations have
granted their employes four weeks'
leave on full pay if they wish to at
tend the training camp but the United
Fruit Co., so far as known, is the first
that has promised to pay expenses as
well. The expenses of the recruits
are estimated at about $60.
The Military Training Camps asso
ciation made public today a telegram
sent to President Wilson asking his
assistance in urging the passage of
that section of the new army bill
authorizing the appropriation of funds
to meet the expenses of training camp
recruits who will accept government
assistance. The association said it
feared congress may delay passage of
the necessary appropriation for an
other six weeks. The total enroll
ment for the Plattsburg camp today
reached 10,727.
WAGE QUESTION TO
BE THRESHED OUT
New York, June 2.—Preliminaries
occupied the attention of the railroad
managers and the representatives of
their conductors, engineers, firemen
and trainmen at today's meeting. For
the first time in the history of their
labor controversies, the railroad lead
ers and their men are trying to settle
their disputes in public. Both sides
have agreed that an open conference
will give the public a chance to form
its own opinion of the merits of the
questions under consideration.

London, June 2.—Earl Kitchener had
today what was for him the unique ex

Army Officers Awaiting a
Report From Pershing
of Recent Meeting
Washington, D. C., June 2.—A week
or more will be taken by administrar
tlon officials to. frame a reply to Gen.
Carranza's last note threatening war
if American troops are retained in
Mexico, it was said today. President
Wilson was out of the city and no
active preparations were being made
to draw an answer. The usual cabinet
meeting was cancelled, since the presi
dent was not to return until late to
day from Annapolis, where he went
to attend commencement exercises at
the naval academy.
Army offloers today looked for a re
port from Gen. Pershing on his con
ference yesterday at Colonla Dublan
with Gen. Gavins Carranxa military
commander in northern Chihuahua.
The meeting was brief and it is as
sumed only questions of cooperation
in troops movements were discussed.
Gen. Pershing described the confer
ence as "very satisfactory," according
to unofficial reports.
The war department's plans for
maintaining Gen. Pershing's column
in Mexico were unchanged.
8HOP8 ON WHEELS.

quartermaster's department here un
loaded today two four wheel driven
motor truck? of special design for
field work. Each truck is a complete
machine shop on wheels, possessing
all the necesary appliances of a mod
ern machine shop and garage. Some
of th'i noteworthy features of these
vehicles are lathes, drills, forges, an
vils and an acetylene welding outfit.
These especially constructed trucks
will ply between Palomas and Gen.
Pershing's advance base, thus obviat
ing the necessity for broken down
trucks to be dragged to Columbus for
repairs.
Efforts are being made to dispatch a
great quantity of reserve sustenance
supplies and forage to the expedition
ary column before the rainy season
sets in. Big motor supply tractors with
caterpillar wheels are now being test
ed out here at the base to decide their
availability for use during the rainy
season. Reports are current here that
a mutiny of Carranza troops at Villa
Ahumada, 100 miles south of Juarez,
took place last evening, during which

EASY FOB CROOKS
Chicago, June 2.—Police today are
looking for a man known as H. Davis
and are holding in custody Henry E.
Smith, an insurance agent, who was
arrested yesterday for attempting to
aid Davis in cashing a draft for $10,
000 drawn by W. H. Matteson of Mor
ris, 111.
According to the story, Matteson
told the police he met Davis in Florida
last winter, where Davis was said to
have posed as a real estate broker.
Matteson said that he was allowed to
bet on a horse race without putting up
any money and was told that he had
won $40,000. Davis then undertook to
get the money for him, he said, but he
was required to advance $10,000 to
show evidence of good faith. Davis
was given a check for that amount by
Matteson and they came to Chicago
and cashed It. Later, Davis wanted
some more of Metteson's money and
went to Morris to get it. He told Mat
teson that it was necessary to put up
$10,000 more to get his winnings and
Matteson gave him a draft for the
amount. It was while Davis and Smith
were trying to cash this draft yester
day that the police were called in and
Smith was arrested. Davis escaped.

SIXTEEN OUCHES
DELEGATES LOSE
FICBT FOR SEATS
COMMITTEE VOTE8 TO 8EAT CON
TESTING DELEGATIONS FROM
BTATE OF GEORGIA.
Chicago, June 2.—Consideration of
claims of contesting delegations to the
republican national convention was re
sumed this morning by the republican
national committee, which opened its
deliberations here yesterday in a con
tinuous session lasting more than nine
hours.
The Louisiana contest involving
twelve delegates was the first taken
up at today's session. It will be fol
lowed by the contests in Mississippi,
Missouri and North Carolina. In the
order named.
The fight in the Louisiana delegation
today will again be between the so*
called "lily whites" and the "black
and tans" as has been the case at for
mer committee meetings preceding
national conventions. The contesting
delegations were chosen at separate
meetings In Louisiana, the "lily
whites" holding their meeting at a
hotel in New Orleans where colored
people were not allowed entrance.
The delegation was consequently com
posed exclusively of whites, the col
ored population being given no repre
sentation. The other delegation is
composed of an equal number of
whites and colored people. Neither
side is committed to any delegate and
the fight for convention seats is in
reality a fight for control of local poli
tics in Louisiana.
As the result of the committee's
deliberations yesterday, sixteen votes
which were considered as certain to
be past for Justice Charles E. Hughes
were loBt to that candidate "When the
committee voted to seat the Henry S.
Jackson delegation from Georgia. The
delegates who were awarded tne seats
are said to be favorable to the candi
dacy of Senator Root, with John W.
Weeks as a second choice. The seven
protests in Alabama were settled by
the seating of six regular delegates
at large and a protesting delegate
from the ninth congressional district
A recommendation by Chairman
Hilles that a small committee be ap
pointed to hear the evidence in sev
eral of the contests and report the
gist of it to the full committee was
defeated. The committee also voted
to place the delegates from Porto Rico,
Hawaii and the Philippines on the
temporary roll call with the recom
mendation that they be given votes.
