A decision rendered by the su
preme court of the United States
with respect to exaggeration in
advertising, is of very reat im
portance to the many new pro
motions of mining investments,
says the Arizona State Bureau
of Mines. The court held that
exaggeration of statement was
as much misrepresentation in
kind if not in degree, as deliber
ate falsehood.
The only drawback to the un
exampled prosperity of Arizona
has been removed and the for
ward speed of development of
the state during the next few
months will be as never before
in its history, says a report of
the Arizona State Bureau of
Mines. The low price of silver
no longer hangs over the market
affording an excuse for the delay
in the restoration of the high
state of prosperity.

federal building here for post

is great need of the erection of
such building in Kingman, as

County Recorder Owen E.
Murphy has written to Attorney
Wiley E. Jones for an opinion
on the non-partisan registration
question. A number of those
who have already registered
have written in to have their re
gistrations changed so as to now
insert a party where they re
fused or neglected to name their
party affiliations at the time they
registered. The general impres
sion here is that blanks as they
have subscribed and sworn to
before a notary public. If the
changes were to be allowed there
would be opened a chance to de
feat the very purpose of the new
law that requires a voter to ex
press his party qualification at
the time he registers. Prospector.
Progressive Republicans in
Pima county will probably have
three candidates in the race for
Republican nominations this fall
if the parties amalgamate at
Chicago. They will be Peter E.
Howell for county recorder, Geo.
Gray for treasurer, and B. F.
Daniels for sheriff. There has
been some talk to the effect that
Mr. Daniels would not seek the
nomination if Colonel Roosevelt
is nominated at Chicago, but
these statements are not author
itative and it is believed that the
former United States marshal
who ran as a Progressive two
years ago will be in the Repub
lican race for the nomination
this year.
As. predicted in last week's

presenting Los Angeles capital,
was in town Wednesday on his
way to the property. While here
he made arrangements to put on
a small crew of men as the pre
liminary to starting up the prop

companied by Nick Touroff, who
will be in charge of the work.

CALLES ASKS RECIPROCITY.
A recent dispatch dated Doug
las, Arizona, says:
General P. Elias Calles, mili
tary commander of Sonora, be
lieves in strict reciprocity in all
things, even to the extent of in
flicting hardship upon American
cattlemen in Sonora, if this gov
ernment does not force owners
to return cattle smuggled across
the international boundaries, or
collect for Mexico the duties on
such cattle.
Gen. Calles issued the follow
ing statement today through Ives
G. Lalevier, de facto consul here:
''General Calles believes he is
entitled to reciprocity in the cat
tle business.
In the past where Americans
have smuggled cattle into So
nora, he has ordered them sent
back. He thinks the United
States should act in the same
spirit. If the authorities and
the American cattlemen are not
reasonaoie lwcne matter, 10 win
be the American cattlemen who
will lose. If the American gov
ernment does not see its way
clear to send back the 800 cattle
recently smuggled across here
and at Lang's ranch, General
Calles thinks that the govern
ment should at least see that the
duty is paid in full.
"If something like this is not
done, General Calles will insist
that all cattle be kept 15 or 20
miles below the border. In such
a case, it would be the American
owners of large cattle ranges on
the Mexican side along the bor
der who would suffer."
