The annual meeting of the Nevada
State Automobile association was
held In the city hall in Ely on Tues
day last and was attended by repre
sentatives from the different parts of
Nevada and California associated
with the association.
President C. G. Patrick was au
thorized to appoint a committee to
encourage all automobile clubs
throughout the state to become affil
iated with the state association A
committee will be appointed to ap
pear before the next legislature in
Carson City with a view of having
uniform legislation adopted for the
benefit of roads througout the state.
Covernor Boyle was present and
addressed the club. The governor
suggested that the committee ap
pointed be impressed with the advis
ability of getting together on impor
tant questions .and thereby be in a
position to submit to the lawmakers
certain matters which would , not
meet with opposition from the differ
entent sections. He referred to the
Shacklcford bill now pending in con
gress and under the terms of which
some eighty-five millions of dollars
would be expended throughout the
United States, but called attention to
Tungsten Camps
Astir
; White Pine county Is having a big
tungsten Worn and the following It
ems from the Ely Record are of in
terest. .
; On Tuesday last the first unit of
the Consolidated Tungsten company
mill, which company 1- operating
properties about two miles south of
the U. S. Tungsten, went into com
mission, and has been running stead
ily since that time. The first unit has
a capacity of about 20 tons a day, but
it Is the intent of the management to
add two more units to the plant in
the near future, after which It will
be prepared to handle about' 60 tons
of ore daily.
The last piece of machinery for the
new plant of the Independent Tung
sten company of Sheelite left Ely
Monday morning, and Is now probab
ly In place, hence it is a question of
but a few days until this new and
modern concentrating plant, with a
capacity of 30 tons dally, will be in
operation. The management has met
with a number of unavoidable delays
in the erection of the plant, caused
by the failure of the machinery hous
es to comply with their contract, but
in the meantime development work
was continued on the mines, which
are now In splendid shape for pro
duction. It has been announced that
this new plant will treat custom ores,
o which there is a large tonnage in
the Sheelite district.
Grover Tllford arrived in Ely Wed
nesday laBt from the Tilford Bros,
camp at Sheelite, and reporta that
the heavy snow which fell there dur
ing the week filled up the open ditch
through which the water supply was
secured for the milling plant, which
afforded a good excuse for him to
close down for a few days and come
in ' for needed supplies. Since the
mill was started it has been averag
ing about 100 pounds of concentrates
per day, which are still carried in
fstock, as no sales have as yet been
made. During the last week a small
miling test was made from the mines
of Baird Bros., which proved most
satisfactory.

Campbell Properties
Down At Goodsprings
Early in the spring of 1884 Allen
0. Campbell, then operating the Horn
Silver mine at Frisco, Utah, being at
tracted by reports of rich lead finds
at Goodsprings, made a short visit to
this district, and after a survey of the
possibilities of the country returned
to Utah and outfitted an expedition
which returned to Goodsprings and
thoroughly prospected the country
for lead and silver. Many claims
were located, the. location work done
and recorded, and in succeeding years
Mr. Campbell sent crews of men from
Utah to do the required assessment
work on these claims. About 189 he
had the greater part of these claims
surveyed for patent, 22 of them even
tually being granted the final papers
by the government. Some shipments
of ore have been made from these
claims, but as the owner could fore
see that a railroad was necessary for.
the profitable transportation of the
ores, they were allowed to lie dor
mant until a railroad was built into
the country.
In 1902 Mr. Campbell died." The
railroad he required was not built un
til three years after his death, but
subsequent events have demonstrated
that his contention that the property
would be valuable with the coming of
the railroad has been proved to be
correct.
