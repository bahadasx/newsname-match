d time since 1891, a change will be
r- tffected in these pieces. The an

Disease Described In Ne,
Circular.
Every citrus-fruit grower ir
Louisiana should have a copy of
c- ircular No. 15, entitled Citruw
Canker, which has just been is
ed sdhd by the Extension Division of
oo the Louisiana State University.
st This circular discusses the ori
gin and distribution of the citrus
c;mnkr, the appearance of the
disease, the varie ties affected,
Ze the cause of the disease how it is
II spreýtd, etc. It also discusses the
is eradication of this disease and
ig shows this can be done only by
o, burning the infected trees.
ý The growers of citrus fruits
should do all in their power to
help the canker eradication work
S[hey are the ones who will pro
'S I fit by the work, and, on the other
w nhand, it will oe their loss if the
•. ranker is not eradicated. Sortime
,f the things the growers and
u. those interested in the orange
industry should do may be brief
ly enumerated, as follows:
1. Keep out of the groves, stay
e away from all citrus trees and do
d not allow animals to run in the
g orchards. Do not allow visitors
. in your orchards. Individuals
with canker cures should be in
vited to stay away. The only
e persons who should be permitted
n to go near the trees are the in-1
g spectors who have charge of the
g eradication work.
g 2. It is very dangerous to set
out citrus stock of any kind until
the canker is under complete
e control. To plant citrus stock at
V the present time will only help to
o complicate a serious situatirn and
is liable to spread the disease.
3. Be careful in picking fruit
Srhe disease can be spread very
s easily by fruit pickers. If there
is canker present in the neighbor
I hood inspectors should be consul
J ted in regard to pickingthe fruit.
i 4. Help the inspectors as much
as possible in their work. This
can be done by giving them in
I formation regarding citrus plant
t ings in the locality and by ren
a dering them any desired assie
tance while they are inspecting.
Remember at all times that the
citrus industry depends upon
the eradication of the canker. If
the canker is eradicated Louis
iana can become an important
citrus-grownmg state; otherwise,
there it little hope for the mdus
-Itry.

INTOXICATED.
"I'm afraid, Robert, you're
just a little intoxicated."
The doctor's tone was so serious
chat the boy looked up quickly,
an indignant flush mounting to
check and temple.
That mustn't go on."
"I thougat you knew me better
han that, sir!" the boy blui-ted
,lt; then his lips relaxed under
-ne doctor's quizzical smile. I see
1ow you dian't mean-exactly
what you said."
"Yes, I did, exactly," replied
Sthe doctor quietly.
"I feared it when Iheard that
the legacy had been left to you
and Eleanor. It takes a stronger
head and a braver heart to cope
with prosperity than it does to
stand the hard knocks of adver
sity,"
"But we don't intend to be fool
ish," the boy protested. "You
know how I've scrubbed along at
.:ollege these two years, waiting
ýn table and janitor work to help
gay my bills. I tell you it's a plea
Sant feeling to know that's done
with. And it came so unexpected
ly, too. I never even dreamed of
such a thin'."
"That's the peril of it," doctor
said thoughtfully. "Last week I
=aw a woman intoxicated with

son was killed instantly in an ac
cident, and the shock upset her
as completely as wine ever could
She didn't care what she said or
did. The machinery was running
wild, with no one at the engi.e.
The next day she was herself,,
only sadder. The intoxication had
passed, and her reason had got
back toits seat.
"I knew a sadder case once; it
was a promising young mechanic,
a sober, hard-working fellow.
