With the formation of a $3,500,000
Connecticut corporation the stock of
which is said to have been totally sub
scribed and which is reported to hold
'contracts with foreign governments to

ledv.. . .
The Argonaut Salvage corporation
of Milford, yesterday filed with the
, secretary of state a certificate of in
corporation. The capital stock Is
$3,500,000, divided into 10,000 shares
of common and $23,000 pf preferred
the latter to yield dividends of not
- less than 7 per cent. .
The incorporators, as shown in the
, certificate, are John O. Hoffman of
jlew York, Carl P. Ford of Milford,
and R.' J- Oliver of Woodmont, Conn.
'. These. Incorporators are admitted, to
.be representatives of large financial
(interests.
It is stated on the authority of both
;j Simon Lake land Attorney Carl Kos
" Iter, who drew the papers, that the
I Incorporation is not of the stock-job-tblng:
character, as the stock already
Ihas been fully subscribed anij prepa
rations for immediate work have be
ignn. The corporation fee, paid to the
state yesterday, was $1,750.
The purposes of the corporation, as
ioutlined in the incorporation certin
jeate, are extremely broad, giving the
new company right to salvage boats,
steamships, vessels and cargoes, to
search for and locate sunken or
stranded wrecks, to reconstruct wrecKS
of any kind, to build, make, repair.
operate and maintain, buy. sell and
deal in boats, submarines, wrecks and
cargoes and to operate patents or any
Interest therein granted by any gov
ernment, as well as to own, lease, op-
erate, etc., lands, docks, lighthouses,
fete.
Simori Lake, when reached by tel
ienhone at his Milford home today, ad-
-rimitted knowledge of the company
iwhich has already secured rights to
the use of his submarine enginering
"The new company is to build and
.nnorato submarine salvage boats
n-ntber than the offensive submarine,"
said Mr. Lake. "While I am not in
.a position to disclose the plans fully
I mav say that the present incorpora
tors merely acted as representatives
.ri- much larger interests whose
financial stability is unquestioned.'
Mr. Lake refused to deny or affirm
that his Interests in the company in
cluded more than such patent rights
e.s he' has granted the new concern.
When asked if his recent purchases
along the Housatonic river in Strat
ford would be used as the base for a
. .submarine plant, he also refused to
deny or affirm. that such was the case,
(though tacitly admitting that the site
had been considered.
A. significant fact in connection with
'the incorporation is that Attorney
rCarl Foster, who has always repre
sented Mr. Lake in his legal and
financial transactions, as well as ap
pearing as attorney for incorporators
jfor other large concerns of which the
Bridgeport Projectile Co. is among
ithe latest local enterprise, drew the
papers of incorporation which give
such wide scope to operations.
Mr. Foster when questioned at his
office refused to admit the identity of
ithe interests behind the company
other than to confirm the statement
made by Mr. Lake that the real in
terests were not revealed in thel 1st
of incorporators.
Persons in this city well acquainted
with submarine engineering feats as
sert that the number of vessels sunk
abroad in comparatively shallow
water has astounded all nations, and
particularly those involved as bellig
erents. Agents of foreign govern
ments, covetous of the ships and car
goes of opponents, are known to have
offered fabulous sums to salvage con
cerns for the recovery of wrecks or
cargoes. Likewise large marine In

will hold out, they say. They issued
the following statement today:
"The company has been trying to
install a bonus system In which the
girls would have to do 12 hours work
in nine -hours, which meant a cut of
three cents - per hundred.- The girls
refused, as they thought the work
was hard enough and asked more
wages. The superintendent admitted
it is the hardest and dirtiest work and
yet is the poorest paid job In the fac

MIGHT LEGAL
BATTLE STAGED
IN CITYSTREETS
Dr. Schwartz, Estranged
from Mother Because of
Marriage, In New Tangle.
Scratched windows, torn curtains,
signs upside down and furniture
topsy-turvy are the remains today of
the once immaculate dental offices of
Dr. Jacob Schwartz in . the United
building at Fairfield avenueand Main
street.
Following close upon the heels of
romance and litigation, one of the
most unique legal battles that has had
its place in the street was precipitated
at midnight when Dr. Schwartz at
tempted to move his equipment from
the building.
As a result of the attempted furni
ture removal, suit for $400 for dam
ages and back rentals was instituted
by Mrs. Emma Schwartz, of Yonkers,
N. Y., the dentist's mother and In the
absence of regularly appointed deputy
sheriffs the statutory provision for
deputy sheriff substitution of an in
different person was invoked for the
first time in many years by Attorney
Theodore Steiner, attorney for Mrs,
Schwartz.
In this connection Howard K. Mc
Lean, a ' wine clerk in the Seaside
Hotel, owned by his father, Charles
H. McLean, was taken from the street
where he had been a spectator of the
unusual sight, and was made a dep
uty ' sheriff under oath of office for
only two hours after which . he was
replaced by Deputy Sheriff Robert F.
Nichols, who was delayed in arriving
at the scene.
Under the impressed service of Mc
Lean the removal was stopped and
the fulnlture reconveyed to the office
under attachment. Discovery that
the lettering on the windows had been
scratched, that, curtains had been
torn and that plumbing fixtures had
been ripped from the walls brought
threats of criminal prosecution
against Dr. Schwartz today.
It is known that the summary pro
cess suit for eviction of Dr. Schwartz
from the building was settled Friday
when Judge Wilder, signed an order
of judgment by consent of counsel in
which Dr. Schwartz acquiesced to re
moval. The incidents of last night are said
to have developed as the result of his
marriage to Miss Lillian Graves,
daughter of the Fairfield avenue jew
eler. Dr. Schwartz, in a statement,
asserted that his mother was angered
because no dowry had been received
through the alliance. The matter has
been in the courts for nearly a month.

ILL BERLIi
Berlin, June 3. (By wireless from
a staff correspondent of the Associat
ed Press, via Sayville.) The first na
val battle on a grand scale during the
present war has been attended by re
sults which, according to information
received here, are highly satisfactory
to the Germans, not only in respect of
the comparative losses of the two fleets
but in the fact that the Germans
maintained the field after the battle.
This is shown, German commentators
assert, by the rescue of British survi
vors. '
The full German high sea fleet was
engaged, under personal command fo
Vice-Admiral Scheer, the energetic
German commander who succeeded
Admiral Von Pohl. The British fleet
is now estimated at approximately
twice as strong in guns and ships as
that under Admiral Scheer.
Detailed reports have not yet been
received but the main engagement ap
parently' occurred about 125 miles
south-southwest of the southern ex
tremity of Norway and 150 miles off
the Danish coast. The battle was
divided into two sections. The day
engagement began at 4 o'clock in the
afternoon and continued until dark
ness, or about 9 o'clock. This was
followed by a series of separate en
gagements through the night.
The exact ranges and courses of the
day fight have not been ascertained. It
is; assumed the ranges of the day. en
gagement were not extreme, possibly
at a distance of about eight miles, as
the weather was hazy.
The German torpedo boats and de
stroyers were more effective' than the

SURVIVORS A
BIG BATTL
London, , June 3 Wounded men
from . the North Sea battle reached
London this morning. They were
quickly removed to hospitals or their
homes. The public was prohibited
from talking to the men, but crowds
assembled outside the barriers at the
railway station, cheering them.
There is no estimate of the number
of wounded, but it is feared that the
loss Will exceed 5,000 officers and
men, including the whole crew' of the
Queen Mary.
-There is no news of the crews of
other ships lost but the Germans re
port that they picked up some and a
few have arrived at neutral ports.
CLOSE RANGE IN
BATTLE BECAUSE
OF HEAVY HAZE
London, June 3 Official accounts
of the North Sea battle aref ramed in
terms so generol that no accurate idea
of the tactics employed can be gath
ered. Naval experts comment in re
strained manner on the probabilities
of this greatest naval battle since the
war began. The main outline of oper
ations seems to be as follows:
The action took place off the coast
of Jutland, between Skagerak and
Horn's Riff, some 20 miles due west
of Esbjorg, Denmark. Therefore, it
would appear that the German bat
tle fleet came out from Wilhelmsha
ven and not from Kiel.
The strength of the Germans is not
stated but it is assumed that the main
high sea fleet was 60, including bat
tleships, battle cruisers, light cruisers
and destroyers. The strength of the
British force has not been made
known, although it is ascertained
there were present the battle cruiser
squadron, four battleships,- some arm
ed cruisers, several light cruisers and
a force of destroyers. It was this
fleet that first engaged the German
high sea fleet.
The weather was thick and the
range of vision was perhaps not more
than six miles. Therefore, the action
was fought at short range, in which
both the main and secondary arma
ments were brought to bear. The
German battleships mount very pow
erful secondary armament so that the
British battle cruisers were exposed
at short range to a tremendous fire,
three of them being destroyed.
Only Few Are Saved
London, June 3 An official state
ment given out today shows that, with
a few exceptions all the officers on
the Invincible, Queen Mary, Indefati
gable, Defense and Black Prince were
lost. All the officers o4 the Warrior
nept one were saved.

British, accounting to a considerable
extent for the successes of the Ger
mans against an overwhelmingly su
perior force. It is understood the
Queen Mary and the Indefatigable
were 'both sunk in the day battle. It
has not been learned when the War
spite and the other British warships
went down. (The loss of the War
spite is denied officially by the Brit
ish.) All the German warships except
those mentioned in the official report
reached Wilhelmshaven safely. Thus
far nothing has been reported re
garding the extent to which any of
these vessels were damaged. A full
er report from Admiral Scheer is ex
pected soon.
It is stated at the Admiralty that
at least 34 British capital shps were
engaged and that the Brtlsh torpedo
flotillas were severely handled. The
battleship Westfalen alone sank six
torpedo boats during the night' en
counters. German personnel and material
alike stood . the test brilliantly and
the damage sustained by the German
fleet is small in comparison with the
British losses. The battleship Pom
mern, which was sunk, was command
ed by Captain Boelken.
Berlin is decked with flags and the
achievement of the German fleet has
aroused the greatest enthusiasm.
There was a remarkable demonstra
tion in the Reichstag when Rear Ad
miral Hebbinghaus, former naval at
tache to. the German embassy . at
Washington, announced the result of
the battle. '
WOUNDED
RIVING FROM
El NORTH SEA
The German loss of life must have
been almost as great as that of the
British if the British estimate of the
destruction of two battleships and a
naval cruiser and other smaller ships
is correct. .
The scenes at the Admiralty this
morning were most distressing, the
building being surrounded by relatives
and .friends of the crews in the en
gagement. As for the fight and Its result, there
was an inclination this morning after
the receipt of the later official ac
count not to consider the outcome of
the engagement so disastrous as it was
at first thought, although no attempt
I was made to minimize it.
AERIAL FLEETS
GREATLY AIDED
GERMAN ATTACK
Berlin, June 3 "Supplementing
the official report of the admiralty,"
says the Overseas News Agency, "if
is stated by a competent authority
that in the North Sea battle the Ger
mans had in action the high sea fleet,
with dreadnaughts and' older battle
ships, battle cruisers and " also light
sea forces, including torpedo boat and
submarine flotillas. The Germans
faced the greater part of the modern
British navy.
"The German reconnoitering forces
first entered into combat with the
enemy's battle cruisers and light
cruisers at about 5 p. m. Later the
main forces on both sides took part
in the fight. During the day battle,
German torpedoboats several times
entered into action successfully, one
of them three times. The fight kept
on until 9 o'clock in the evening.
"During the night both sides made
violent attacks with torpedoboats and
cruisers in which there were further
British losses. The leading German
ship annihilated six modern British
destroyers. All German reports em
phasize ' the bravery shown by the
British during the fight, which lasted
almost without interruption for 2
hours.
"H. M. S. Fjrauenlob must be defi
nitely considered lost. Apparently
she sank during the night in one of
the smaller engagements. Five Ger
man torpedoboats have not returned
but a large part of the men have been
rescued. Although the weather was
unfavorable for aerial reconnoitering
during all the time of the engage
ment,, naval airships and aeroplanes
contributed considerably to the suc
cess of the German sea forces."
New stock issues, without permis
sion of the Minister of Finance, have
been prohibited by the French Senate.
