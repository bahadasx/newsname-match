Monster Demonstration For

Iiit'-rtintioiial News Servier
FIIIFAGO. June ::. The voice of
the great middle west lifted today
and with a detonating roar refuted
the accusation that it harbors a
1 tic Hist and anti-preparedness spirit.
Promptly at ! o'clock the word
word was given in Chicago that sent
more than i'UO.t'üü flag-bedecked
men and women into a parade,
stretching miles upon miles, that
v ill last until almost midnight to
night. Pvery marcher carried a
Hag. Three hundred bands made
the streets reverberate with The
Star Spangled Panner and America.
At the head of the monster pageant
strode three figures with life and
drum, costumed to represent the
characters portrayed in the famous
painting "The Spirit of '73.M
Chicago consecrated herself on
the shrine of preparedness today.
Practically even' business house in
Chicago was closed. In the loop dis
trict not a wheel was turned. Street
cars were not allowed to enter the
mile square after IPÖO, nor were
ether vehicles.
More than a million persons
rowded their way into the thronged
down town district to view the pro
cession. More than 2,00 0 policemen
and dozens of Ped Cross stations
were scattered about prepared to al
eeviate a crush unprecedented in
the annals of any. city.
Pa ratio in Tluve Scxtions
The parade itself was so gigantic
that it had to be formed ir.to three
sections, the first starting at !::..!
the second at l-::'.. and the last will
i-et away at t".::; this evening. It was
U constant panorama of red. white

Starting at Van Puren st., the

engaged in seeking a lOlG standard
' I ! ( arcr. Politicians momenta rily for-
i-d their plans and schemes and
.adned in the emotional frenzy which
had all Chicago in its grasp.
At Randolph st. the parade turned
west and thereafter zigzagged and
criss-crossed through the principal
loop streets. n ither side of the
marchers strode two other parades
of spectators keeping up with them.
Millionaire marched next to his
gardener or hautfeiir. There was no
taste or class line drawn.
At the Art institute on Michigan
