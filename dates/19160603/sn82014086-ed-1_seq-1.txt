RESULTED IN A VICTORY
England Loses Three Battle Cruisers, Three - .Cruisers,'. Eijjit
DestroyersGermany is
1 Cruiser Other Craft Are
London. June 2 Picking its way from
its base in the Kiel canal, the German
high sea fleet on Wednesday after
noon emerged into the North Sea, and
off the coast of Jutland engaged a
British fleet throughout the afternoon
and night in what probably was the
greatest naval battle in the world's
history, so far as tonnage engaged and
tonnage destroyed was concerned.
Britain's Losses Heavy. .
"Wfhen the battle ended Great Britain
had lost the cruisers Queen Mary. In
defatigable and InvincJ . the cruis
ers Defence, Black Frlnj,.-.iid Warrior,
and eight torpedo boat destroyers;
while the German-battleship Fommern
had been. sent to the bottom by a tor
pedo and the cruiser Wiesbaden sunk
by the British gun fire. In addition
several German torpedo craft were
missing and the small cruiser Frauen-
lob had last been seen badly listed and
was believed-to have gone to the bot
tom. These losses have all been ad
mitted! by Great Britain and Germany,
. Other Scores Are Claimed.
' Aside from Great Britain's conceded
lossee, Germany claims that the Brit
ish flagship, Warsplle, sister ship- of
the Queen .Elizabeth, and one of the
largest and most powerful ships -afloat,
had been sunk; that the battleship
Marlborough, a vessel of 25,000 . tons
had been hit by a torpedo and a sub
marine had been destroyed. Great
Britain also added to Germany's ac
knowledged losaes with the claim- that
one dreadnought of the German
Kaiser class vessels of 24,700 tons and
carrying a corapletraent of 1,088 -men,
had .been attacked and destroyed by
British torpedo craft, that ' another
battleship of the same class was - be
lieved to have been snnk by gunfire,
"that one battur cruiser had been blown
up and two others damaged, and that
a submarine also had beed sent to the
bottom.
' Many Lives Lost. - .
Great Britain's admitted loss ill ton
nage was 114,810 for the si battle
cruisers and cruisers. That of Ger
many, excluding the tonnage of the
Wiesbaden, of which vessel there is
no record, was IS.lVt. " The tonnage of
the capital snips sunk by the Japanese
in their fieht with the Russians in the
battle of Tsushima, in May, 105. aggre
gated 43,000. Twenty-one Russian
craft were destroyed in this fight, in
cluding six battleships and four cruis
ers. The remainder of the sunken
craft comprised coast defence and spe
cial service vessels and torpedo boats.
That the casualties in the fighting oft
-.utiana were neavy is indicated oy the
-fact that of the crew of some 900 on
board the Indefatigable, only two men
are known to have been Baved. Pull
details of the fight in which Zeppelins
are declared to have taken part are be
ing gathered by the British admiralty,
and pending their receipt the censor is
withholding permission to corres
pondents to send put stories from Lon
don. Trawlers Bringing in Viotima of Battle
. The Hague, via London, June X 11.05
p. m. A Dutch trawler has arrived at
the Hook of Holland with one dead
and seven live Germans who were
saved from the naval battle. "Another
trawler has taken into Muiden three
German officers and twelve sailors and
one Brltietv sailor who was wounded.
BRITISH ADMIRALTY
ADMITS HEAVY LOSS.
Three Battle Cruisers,' Three Cruisers
and Several Destroyers Sunk - Six
Destroyer Unaccoupted For.
London, June S, 7.45 p. m. After
rumors had been flying about all day
that a naval battle had occurred in
the North sea, the British, public was
given news -by the admiralty tnis even
ing that will send a painful shock
inrougnout the country.
Loss of British Ships.
According to the admiralty an
. nouncement, in an engagement off Jut
land on Wednesday afternoon the
J-irltltri battle cruiser fleet met a Ger
man fleet, with the result that three
British battle cruisers were sunk, to
gether with three cruisers and several
destroyers, while six destroyers were
arm unaccounted ror.
Battle Lasted Afternoon and - Night.
The battle seems to have lasted
through the afternoon and the follow
ing night. The German fleet's losses
are stated to have been serious, but no
very definite Information of these loss
es la afforded by tine admiralty an
nouncement. One (battle cruiser is de
clared o have ibeen -destroyed and an
other severely .damaged, while the be
lief is expressed that a large number
of German destroyers were disposed of.
Nawa Flashed Out In London.
The news was flashed out In special
editions of the evening- newspapers
and caused greater consternation In
the West End of London than had
been witnessed- on any previous occa
sion wince, the. declaration of. war. - The
frankness of .the admiralty-announce
ment concerning the serious nature of
the ' British losses and -the apparently
mall losses of the .Germans in com
parison led to tine assumption in most
minds that the British vessels must
nave Deen-ied Into a mine field.
Following, quickly upon the admiralty
announcement came the German offi
cial version of the flghit, which,, in
general, eonnrmefl the .Brttlsh account,
t-ti carries the. claim that the-babtle-
Wiiji Warspite also waseunk. and other
tsri lush Dattiesiip-damaged.
