STRENGTH OF DEMOCRATS IS
SHOWN BJJR1ARIES i
Santa Fo; The recent Democrat-1
is primaries in Chaves and F.ddy ;
counties resulted in a showing of j
(.-reatly increased I e ni or r a t í r j
strength, and served to emphasize
the opportunity that this- year con- j
fronts the Democracy of New Mexico
In .Chaves county more than -'ínhi
Democratic votes were cast, or ap
proximately loot) more than ihehigh
est number cast in the first state
election, and in Kddy county the total
was close to 21(H), or more than (loo in
excess of the heaviest vote in t'.MI.
At the presidential election in lull',
and the congressional election in li'li
the vote in hoh counties was less
than that cast for the lies! state
ticket. It is a mutter of record that
many new voters have settled in oili
er sections nf the shite during tin'
last few years, anil that incrcasi'd
I lemocratic strength likewise exists
in several other counties, among
them (Juay, lloosevelt. Curry. I'liion.
Colfax and KGuadahipe. In Santa
Fe, a few days ago. Dr. .1. .1. Shuler.
mayor of Hilton, who so decisively
shipped tin: Ilepuhlicau "gang" of
Colfax county in the recent munici
pal election there, estimated the ad
ditional Democratic votes in Colfax
at from .IM) to 7(10. and declared that
they would enahle that, county to
register heavily on the Democratic
side at the November election, lie
said: "The Democracy of Colfax
county will he united this year, and
it will make its inlliience felt in the
.November results."
To take advantage of tin' oppor
tunity presented by the increased
voting strength this year, effective
work on be part of Democratic coun
ty and precinct organizations, and
individual co-operation on tin part
of the voters, will be nescssary. Ob
viously the aditioual Democratic
votes will be valueless to the parly
unless they are deposited at the polls
in November. In Democratic coun
ties, where primary nominations are
equivalent to election, and where
local interest ends when these nomi
nations are made, every voter must
realize that Democratic principles
and policies, national and state, will
tie at stake in November: that the
future of New Mexico and its peo
ple depends upon Democratic con
trol of state a Hairs, and that both
party loyalty and personal welfare
demand that any effort necessary be
made to aid in a Democratic victory.
In every county of the state aggres
sive, determined and united action
by the Democratic voters is called
for, to the end that lite Ilepuhlicau
machine shall not gain power, and
that the llcpublican history of uu
progressiveness and unscrupulous
ness, of incompetency and gross mis
management in public affairs, and of
llagrant violations of the rights of
the people, shall Hot be repeated ill
New Mexico.
Friends Anxious About Thorpe
The many friends of John Thorpe,
both ' in Clayton and in Kenton,
where lie is well known, are decid
edly anxious concerning the out
come of the operation which he un
derwent some' ten days ago. He was
operated on for-a tumor of the
stomach at the .Mercy Hospital the
first of last week, and Friday his
sister, Mrs. Willis Means, of Keiilon,
received word that his life was a
matter of but a few hours. She
left Friday night for Denver and
nothing lias been heard from her.
Those interested, however, believe
that Mr. Thorpe must be recovering
or somo word would have come be
fore this time.
. Walton Snyder Buys Studebaker
Walton Snyder lias purchased a
three passenger Studebaker road
ster, which was delivered to him
thru the Clayton Garage and Auto
Company. The car was given a
good tryout on the Dalharl trip and
Snyder is well pleased with it.
SHORTAGE OF SEEU BEANS
l.ocul Seed Houses Forced to Send
to Four Corners of Nation for
Legumes
iere is a decided shortage in the
supply of seed beans in the local
market and th.- local dealers arc
tilling mail sacks and burning up
ti'li graph wires in reaching to ev
ery available market for seed beans
to supply the demand.
Hean- sold last, year at about four
dollars and fifty cent per hundred j .
and are now bringing eight scvenly
liv,' and hard to obtain.
Tin-re was an excellent crop of
beans harvested la.-t laM but the
demand for seeding purposes was not
ant icipateil by the local dealers and
Üiey are running short :
The price for good clean .Mexican
I'inlo beans may reach ten dollars,
the highest price in the history of
the seed business here, before the
season for seeding closes.
There is almost three times the
acreage nf beans being planted this
year ns last. This partly accounts
for the shortage, but the shipment nf
beans to other part- of the country
la-l tall and winter depleted the
supply to a great extent.
If you IVve beans hold them:
or better yet. plant them and name

YEAKLE IS PROBABLY SAFF.LÍ
OUT OF COUNTRY
That Alex Yeakle, horsethief and
jail breaker, has made good his es
cape is the belief of local officers
who have been on his trail ever
since he broke jail Wednesday night,
nad who have returned to the city
after a fulil search for the man near
the Colorado line-
Humors of all sorts are afloat on
the streets Some have seen the es
caping jail breaker in the south,
some in the west and some lo the
north. At the present writing' his
whereabouts seem to be as little
known us those of Villa, the artful.
Friday night it was rumored that
he liad hern seen to enter the Col
bert. Canon, near the Colorado line,
ami a posse started for that place
this morning but to the time of go
ing to press, have not reported.
Thursday night a horse was stolen
from Paul Hunter, about two miles
south of town, and reports reached
the cily yesterday to the efTect that
Yeakle had taken the horse, ridden
all Thursday night and was in hid
ing some sixty miles south of town.
This is hardly likely, according in
the niiicers, as it is more probable
that Veakh will head for the breaks
of the CiiijuTou or endeavor to
reach friends in the country known
as the Pickelvv ire canon country,
should be reach this ruffged section
of southern Colorado, where Black
Jack so successfully eluded pursuit
for so many yealis, he is probably
safe for some time as it is practical
ly impossible to find a man hidden
there unless he is betrayed by a
friend, and friends of Yeakle, the of
ficers believe, are not ttiat kind.
The jail break Wednesday night
was a daring one, and apparently
successful for Yeakle. It was not
premeditated hut tin jumping at an
unusual opportunity.
Deputy Klesio Martinez, having
fetl the prisoners in the jail, placed
the three, Yeakle among them, oc
cupying the lower tier in their cells.
threw the Ixilt.s, a-s is customary
ami went to the upper tier to lock
the four cells there. For some reas
on the bolt disking the three lower
cells failed to work and the three
prisoners confined in those cells dis
covered it immediately.
Carefully slipping from their cells
they made for tho door. Reaching
the door they were discovered by
Martine. who jumped from the up
per corridor to tho ground floor and
opened lire on the closest running
figure, Yeakle. At the second shot
Yeakle. dropped to the ground' Mar
line, supposing him dead or injured
turned his attention to the other run
ner making rapidly for the darkness
near the Akin store. Martinez order
ed him to halt, which he did.
Iteturuing the prisoner to the jail
Martine went to look for the man
lie Hint injured or dead, but Yeakle
was not there, nor has he been seen
nor heard of to this hour.
While Martinez was after tho es
caping pair the third prisoner at
tempted to leave the jail but was
forced hack by Mrs. Crumley, whti
having heard the shots rushed to
the scene with a ritlo. She found
tins third prisoner just emerging
from the door and told him to get
back. He complied with the request
after sizing up the situation and is
still comfortably quartered in the
jail.
Officers all over the country have
been notified of the escape of Yeakle
and local officers have not riven up
the chase by any means, so it 18 pro
bably only a matter of a few days
until ho is re-taken.
Popular Land .Man Takes Bride
Ira L. Penninston, one of the most
popular and best known men in
Union county and Mrs. Mildred Ev
ans, were married in Amarillo Wed
nesday. The trip to Amarillo was
made in the groom's new Ford and
without accident. The newly weds
returned to Clayton Thursday and
win make this their home.
