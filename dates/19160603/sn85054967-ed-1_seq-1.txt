The Military Band
Was Re-organized
John C. Watson Resumes His
Duties As Director of the
Organization.
\
During the winter months the
Indiana Military band has been
hibernating like "Br'er Ground
hog" but with the advent of the
spring and summer it has ceas
ed licking its paws and is under'
going a state of rejuvenation
which is wholly due to director
John Watson, who, after having
resigned from the position last
fall, has been prevailed upon to
again résumé charge of the
band . The boys are ali anxious
to get the band back where it
was last fall and it has been a
long time since so much interest
has been displayed by the mem
bers.
Some of the old musicians
who have dropped out have sig
nifìed their intention of coming
back, and altogether the outlook
is very bright for a fine musi
cal organization such as Indiana
might be well proud of. Rehear
sals start Tuesday next and pro
bably two or three will be held
each week. Centennial week
will no doubt see the Indiana
band again in the front rank.
MUSICAL NOTES
Those who did not hear Prof.
,Di Prospero playing the clarin
et at the Strand theater last
Tuesday night certainly missed
a rare treat. Prof Di Prospero
is one of our townsmen and di
rector of one of the best bands
in this county, the Italian band
of Iselin.
/
The clarinet is a difficult in
strument and seldom used as
solo in the orchestra; tut in the
hands of Prof. Di Prospero that
instrument sings like a bird.
"It's a melody divine."

JUNE
How good it is to be alive,
When June is drawing near;
How good it is to hope, to dare,
to strive,
To fling a taunt at fear,
The world is never quite so fair,
And victory never thrills,
As when, withroses in ber liair,
June trips across the hills.
How fair a world, this world
can be,
"When June is just aliead,
"When blcssoms grace the appiè
tree,
And summer rugs are spread
Across the meadows. soft and
green,
And on the graceful slopes,
And on men's faees there's seen,
The glow of splendid hopes.
