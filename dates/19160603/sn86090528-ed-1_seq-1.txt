TAKE STEPS
TO PREVENT
OUTBREAK
Young Race War Staged at Carnival Last
Night and Repetition is Threatened;
Blacks Retreat Following
Furious Clash
A young-race war was started last
night about 10 o'clock at Cue street
carnival, which threatens to produce
results with serious endings tonight.
According to statements issued by the
police, the setting aside of a part of
the swing, and of a number of seats
in the Ferris wheel, for the use of ne
groes, may possibly have been respon
sible for the fight which occurred last
night and which threatens to be fol
lowed tonight by a regular race war.
Last night the trouble is alleged to
have started when a negro seated him
self beside a white boy in the carousal
swing. The white boy shoved the ne
gro off of the swing and the negro re
taliated by knocking the white boy
down. Then it was that the white hid
and the negro each rallied his support
ers about him and the fun began. For
a number of minutes the air was filled
with shouts and cries' anil sections of
bricks. Outnumbered the negroes re
treated and vanished in the direction
of "Two" street, leaving behind a se
ries of threats to return tonight and
clean up on the whites. Negroes are
alleged to have made threats to the ef
fect that they would go home and get
their guns and that several white fu
nerals would follow, to-night's enter
tainment. Mayor Coffman stated this morning
that he would instruct Chief Phillips
to swear in a number of extra police
men and have them on the grounds.
The mavor stated that Chief Phillips
did not have enough available! men to
handlo the situation properly; that the
officers were on the grounds last night
when the disturbance started, but
were on another part of the ground ! ;
that they got to the scene of the trou
ble in time to prevent serious results;
that Chief Phillips and Officers Buird
and Tuck were on hands; that he
would authorize the chief employing
additional policemen to serve tonight
and instruct them to arrest tho'first
man, white or black, citizen or show
man, who attempted to start anything.
Chief Phillips authorized the state
ment that notice would be served up
on the management of the show to
keep all negroes off the swings and
Ferris wheels. "If they want to ca! i
to the? negro trade." said the chief,
"they will have to move their attrac
tion to the negro settlements of Chick
asha." A while driver of a grocery delivery
wagon is alleged to have stated this
morning that feeling seemed to run
o high in the negro settlements oi
the city that white drivers were afraid
to deliver groceries in those portions
of the city, saying that it has become
the custom oi the younger negroes
whenever any trouble arises between
the races, to hang ca the drivers of
delivery wagons and stone them as
they pass through negro town.
The police state that possibly the
starter of last night's trouble came
with the invasion of "Two" street, a
night or so ago. by some whites who
went to that part of the city and start
ed a rough house with some negroes.
At that time the negroes are said to
have gotten the best, of a short, and
furious battle.' '
Following the trouble at the show
last night, serious trouble In another
part of .tbo city waif avWted by a. war
row margin when the porter of ono of
the Chickasha hotels chased .a,.. white
man dowit Cliickashn avenue to , the
Rock Island depot. The' whitii 'buiiiiis
alleged to have gone to hi home af
ter the "chase," armed himself with a
Winchester and started out on a still
hunt, for the porter. The porter had
evidently deemed discretion the better
part of vaior and gone to cover.

"The summer instruction camp idea
is favored by many persons who can

cently offering to pay the expenses ol
eight young inon at Plattsburg.
"I have received many letters ask

booster and says that the man with
tho flowing whiskers ill probably
walk away from the shambles with th
carcasses of Roosevelt and ull the bal
ance of them hung upon the hooVs,
slaughtered, drawn, and quartered.'1 .
When asked to express himself pos
itively as to his belief 'of upon whom'
the n;antle of Republican leadership .
would fall, Mr. Kayser Bald that in bis
opinion Hughes was the only logical
candidate; that he thought be wouli

When asked what he thought that
chances were of "Tteddy" the Bold"
walking into the staiudpat Republican,

rather not express himself.
"Do you decline to be interviewed
upon this point?" asked the reporter.
"Well, no ; but I'd rather not ex
press, myself. However, It does seem
to me that the contest really' lies be
tween Hughes and Roottevelt. No, I
will not say that Roosevelt sold hi
party in 114. He made a soriou
blunder, though, but a blunder which
the majority of the rank and file of
the Republican party will be found
willing and anxious to forgive."
Mr, Ka"ser has beea so fortunate as
to secure a seat in the press section

Mr. Dwyer said that he did not thinlc
