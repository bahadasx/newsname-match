Crude Thoughts from the Editorial Pen
TIhe Newspapers are Preach
ing Better Than Preachers.
Newspapers received an unIuual
and marked tribute the other day
when the Revx. Charles A. .Eaton.
i ,pastor ofe ne of t lie larget chliirches
in New York City and one of the
fiot clergylmen in the cOtn try,
r. jsenlI his charge in otder to,
Ce V 1ntl his choslen work. not inl
, ,ti h,r pIllpit, but through the
pre,,.
It i- 'r. LEaton's belief, shared
Iv manry othIer., that pulic• opinionf
in this countºlr\ must Ife awakened
to its resiouiiliiities in the read
justment which is bound to follow
the great war. I)r. Eaton will
preach this subjecet, but not from
the pulpit. The newspaper will
carry his me.sage to the world in
iifut ire. In reli muihing his post
the eminent clergyman said:
At present the newspapers are
pi caching better than the preachers
and it is through the press that I
hope to work. In common with
the rest of the world, America is
entering upon a new age, and I
feel it my duty to help in forming
public opinion and interpreting
the vast and complicated problems
which confront us."
The foregoing is but another
proof of the growing influence and
power for the community exerted
by the newspaper today. It is not
so many years ago that any close
connection between the clergy and
the press was sufficient cause for a
considerable raising of eyebrows
among the reverend gentlemen and
their followers. Time and expe
rience and, it must be admitted, a
higher standard among newspapers
have changed this attitude.
The press and clergy are today v
working hand in hand, as they li
should work, and preaching reli- re
gious as well as civic righteousness ti
through the newspapers is an ac. li
cepted fact. for, while the pulpit n
addresses itself to hundreds, the n
newspaper speaks to thousands. is

Thelre is no surer safeguard i
against the teimptations that cotlme

love for home. It has brought

a safe place. It is something not
only to love home but to know
that you love it-and to know that
you are happier at home than in
any other spot on earth.
The idea seems to exist among
us that to be polite to each other
in the family circle is foolish and
like putting on airs. We must rid
ourselves of this notion and act on0
the principle that whatever helps
to make our intercourse pleasanter I
outside the family circle should be 1
brouRht into use there. We should I
avail ourselves of any and every- t
thing that can be used to advantage
in our daily inteocourse. It is no
exhibition of airiness to say "thank
you," or "If you please." These a
little courtesies are indications of e
refinement, and costing nothing, li
they help to make the wheels of
life move more smoothly. It is
not in elaborate attempts at polite
ness that true gentility consists. It t1

Home is the greatest school of
life. Few can receive the honors
of a college education, but all are
graduates of home. The learning t
of the university may fade, its
knowledge may moulder in the
halls of memory, but the simple c
lessons of home impressed, upon
the hearts of childhood, defy the
rust of years and outline the vivid
picture of life. "Mid pleasures s
and palaces we may roam. Be it E
ever so humble, there's no place a
like home."
