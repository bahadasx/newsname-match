For the first 10 months of the
fiscal year, internal revenue col
lections on distilled spirits in
creased at the rate of $1,000,000
a month over the corresponding
period a year ago, or $10,000,000
in 10 mouths, while the revenue
on beer decreased.
In 20 months of the new demo
cratic tariff, ending March 31,
1916, the balance of trade in fa
vor of the United States in its
world commerce exceeds $2,936,
--000,000, as compared with leas
than half that, or $1,403,000,000,
during the last 20 months of the
republican tariff. Who wants to
abolish this career of prosperity
by a return to old conditions T
Total exports of manufactures,
not including foodstuffs, during
20 months of war reach $2, 850,
--000,000, of which only one-eighth
consisted of explosives and fire
arms.
Larger postal savings deposits
will now be accepted at the post
office. This is made possible by
an important amendment to the
postal savings act just approved
by President Wilson. A postal
savings depositor may now have
an account amounting to $1,000
upon which interest will be paid.
Formerly $500 was the maximum
amount he pould have to his
credit.
The American Protective Tariff
League, which is an organization
of eastern manufacturers and
capitalists for the purpose of se
curing and maintaining a high
tariff in favor of "big business and
special interests, has issued let
ters of invitation to prominent re
publican politicians over the
country inviting them to attend
the republican national conven
tion at Chicago and to call at the
league headquarters. Big busi
ness which desires special favors
evidently knows which national
convention to attend in order to
get the results desired.
The general conference of the
M. E. church last week voted 434
to 360 to retain in the church dis
cipline the ban against cards,
dancing and theaters. This ques
tion has been up at several ses
sions of the general conference,
and the vote keeps increasing in
favor of lifting the ban on these
amusements, until some of the
church leaders predict that the
ban will be lifted at the next con
ference. Some people have ques
tioned whether the church is grad
ually sliding into worldliness and
sin, or whether it is discovering
that some of the things are not
wrong which it said were wrong,
but in a hundred years from now
all such problems will undoubted
ly be solved and will cease to wor
ry those of us who are then alive.
Everything moves in cycles.
The atom has its orbit as well as
the sun. The seasons come and
go. War and peace come along
in rotation; so do good times and
hard timjes. Ultimately every
thing gets back to its source.
The late Elbert Hubbard said
the only way to have love was to
give it away; which was another
way of saying "Give and ye shall
receive.''
If we buy from others, others
will buy from us. When you pay
a bill you start that money out on
its cyclic journey. It will go first
to Brown, then Smith, then Jones,
then Peters, and finally back it
comes to you, with interest.
Many business men let their
bills run because they think they
will be better off later. But did
you ever notice that every single
instance of bankruptcy began by
letting bills runt
So long iiK a man pays his bills
regularly, when they fall due, so
long will his credit be good; and
■ as long as his credit is safe he can
'do business.
There are men of another duns
who don't owe anything because
they buy nothing. When they
spend a dollar it is like pulling
teeth. But they also never have
anything.
.Money is of no use except for
what it will buy. If it is hidden
under a mattress it doesn't buy
anything; is of no more good to
the owner than a brass monkey,
and will never be of any use to
him until he spends it.
If you desire to prosper, obey
the cyclic law of return. Buy,
and pay the bill promptly. It is
better to sacrifice a little in the
beginning to pay one's bills than
to sacrifice all in the end to pay
them. —Seattle Composing Stick.
AT THE CAPITAL.
(By Congressman C. C. Dill.)
That agricultural credit is just
as important to the farmers of the
nation as commercial and indus
trial credit are to the business
men of the nation, is the theory
upon which both the house and
senate acted in passing the rural
credit bill recently. Owing to
slight differences in the bills, they
are now in conference, but that
we shall have a rural credit law
before congress adjourns is al
linisl a certainty.
The new law does not give the
I'mrnicr.s all they desire, but it
marks a beginning in rural credit
legislation, Once the plan is in
operation we can amend it to suit
the needs of the farmers as they
are more definitely determined.
Under the new law not more than
6 per cent interest can be charged
and those who framed the bill
believe money will be available
at ") per cent for periods of from
5 to #6 years. Farmers will be
able to borrow up to 60 per cent
of the value of their land and to
2*> per cent of the value of im
provements on the hrrrd:
I consider one of the most seri
ous weaknesses of the bill, the
failure to provide a plan whereby
the tenant farmer can borrow
money. There are 2.000,000 ten
ant farmers in the United States
and 37 per cent of the farmers of
the state of Washington are ten
ants. To provide some system
for furnishing capital for the ten
ant farmers is one of the coming
problems to be solved by congress.
We shall no doubt learn much of
value in the operation of the new
law and thus be belter able to
frame some new plan as a result.
Another bill of great interest to
the farmers, recently passed by
the house, was the shipping bill
by which the government now
proposes to assist in placing more
American ships on tho high seas
to carry American produce to
other countries. Today when the
people of European countries are
paying enormous prices for food
grown in America, the shipping
trust reaps most of the profit by
exorbitant charges. The new
bill gives the shipping board pow
er to regulate those rates. I
think that is the best part of the
bill. The bill is now before the
senate and should be passed.
Congress has settled down to
work in earnest for the purpose
of completing the program laid
out by President Wilson and ad
journing by August 1, is possible.
AFTER 23 YEARS.
A copy of the Colville Republi
can, bearing date of March 2;>,
1893, is in possession of I'at I'aru
dis. The Republican was the of
ficial city and county paper, a
7-column 4-pag<; weekly, in its
fifth year, and was owned by J. H
Young. The first column ou the
front page is devoted to the story
of the tragic death of .\fiss Olivia
Anderson, who kept a boarding
house near BOMBWg, and whose
body wan found in shallow water
on the east shore of the Colombia,
less than half a mile south of
Bossburg. The verdict of the
coroner's jury was death by
drowning, with suicidal intent, but
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
the Colville Republican very
graciously ehampiona the dead
girl's tide of the story, and tells
the talc of her brothers' unbroth<
erly relation toward their sister
I ause they did not approve of
her companionship with a son of
the Emerald isle who lavished
his attentions upon her. It was
the consensus of public opinion
that Miss Anderson met her death
by means of some powerful opiate
in the hands of an assassin, who
then gave her a grave in the surg
ing waters of the Columbia.
From the columns of the Re
publican it is noted that the farm
ers hnd commenced the fight on
squirrels 23 years ago, inaugurat
ed by Jacob Stitzel, and in an
item on Mr. Stitzel's squirrel cam
paign, said: "He will buy a
ton of unilaokod lime and pul
verize it. A small quantity
dl' this lime will be thrown in
to the burrows of the little crea
tures and the mouth of the hole
securely tamped with earth. The
moist rarth will slack the lime,
which will generate a poisonous
condition of the atmosphere, in
the diminutive dungeon, which
will prove fatal to the numerous
little quadrupeds,"
It was also chronicled that some
one living near the Dominion
mountain had butchered 27 head
of (leer in the neighborhood of
White .Mud lake, and notice was
given that a repetition of the
slaughter would provoke action
on the part of the game warden.
The question of draining the
Colville valley was then held in
balance of public opinion. Some
claimed that to drain the valley
would not be conducive to a bet
ter system of cultivation, as it
would injure the adjacent lands,
while others maintained that a
drainage system would be of incal
curable benefit to n great portion
of the worthless valley lands.
Mut the differences of opinion
could not be simmered down to
a practical conclusion.
According to the ad columns,
the City Meat Market was op
erated by Pete Hessel. G. B. Ide
was manager of Hotel Colville.
Frank Habein was proprietor of
the Columbia stables. J. M. Ste
vens was proprietor of the Col
ville Truck and Dray Line. R.
B. Lee carried an ad on hardware
and groceries, P, Barman two ads
on hardware and general merchan
dise, and Perraa & Lemery an ad

J, 11. Young had just purchased
the Colville Republican, and that
week printed v clipping from the
Snohomish Democrat, as follows:
•'The Colville Republican, hereto
fore a standard republican paper,
has been purchased by J. H.
Young, who will swing it into
line with the democrats, and train
