Newspaper Man Tells Story
of Greatest Naval Battle
By Ed L. Eeene.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
London, Juno 3. Developments to
day clearly showed that the entire Bri
tish nnd German high seas fleets were
engaged on Wednesday in the greatest
naval battle in tho history of the
world. '
Sir John Jcllicoe, in supremo com
mand of the British naval forces, di
rected the English fight with Vice Ad
miral Scheer, Germany's supreme power
on the seas, heading the kaiser's ar
mada. Against more thain IS British ships
which were sent to the bottom, German
losses were hardly half as large, but j
. ftritons found satisfaction today when
it was learned that Jcllicoe aud his
dreaduaughts had faced the enemy, that
j not a ship of the first powerful line
was lost and that the German dread
1 naughts were forced to return to their
bllIA
it ; nw estimated that more than
1 5,0u0 British officers and nien went
jdowti with their ships. Rear-Admirals
i Hood and Arbuthnot were lost.
Rear-Admiral Beatty, hero of the
fight which resulted in the sinkiug of
the Bluecher, was the first British
commander in action, and was till but I
trapped by the Germans. His cruiser

Beatty could only retreat, out not he-j

to do deadly execution. j
His cruisers nnd destroyer were shut-1

began to fall the main battle raged. At
9:20 in the evening the finish of the
encounter of big shiirs came. All during
the fight torpedo boats and submarines
had been used 'for small sallies, but
with the fall of darkness ciune tho real
struggle for the smaller craft.
Like infantrymen in land fighting,
these small boats made desperate
charges against the lines of their en
emy. Light British destroyers were
lost. The Germans lost six.
It was declared at the admiralty to
day tkat in the German torpedo boat
charges, not one torpedo scored a hit.
After Jellicoe arrived and the torpedo
attacks were completed, the Germans
withdrew.
Jellicoe remained on the scene of bat
tle during the icmaindcr of the night.
On Thursday morning when there re
mained nothing to fire at, he returned
to the British coast.
Most of the fighting was at a range
of from five to six miles. .
It was established this afternoon that
despite his encounter with the full
strength of the German fleet and his
narrow escape, Admiral Beatty has re
turned safely to port.
At the admiralty it is considered the
British fleet fully showed its superior
ity to the Germans. Fmphasis is laid
on the fact that Jellicoe waited on the
scene, for ma,ny hours for further pos
sible action, but that the Germans did
uot ngain offer battle when the Eng
lish offered their full strength.
The sum totul of the English cluims
at the admiralty is that a portion of the
British fleet met a portion of the Ger
man fleet and forced it to retire, also
that the Germans were in their own wa
ters while the British were nearly GOO
miles from home.
If the engagement had been fought
in British waters, not. a single German
would hnve reached home, was one un
official statement of the admiralty.
A story iu circulation that Prince Al
bert, King George's sailor son was in
the engagement was denied today.
With the first announcement of casu
alty lists at Portsmouth agonizing
scenes were to be witnessed there and
at other port towns On some streets

By Perry Arnold.
(United Press stuff correspondent.)
Chicago, June 3. Sudden realization
of tho fact today that Theodore Roose
velt has now garnered tho support of a
goodly portion of Big Business that
portion from whicli a sizeable sharo of
the sinews of war ure usually collected,
injeetod a new problem in thu pre
convention logrolling along Caudi
dates' Row today.'
The old guard contingent has hereto
fore felt seeuro in its stand that the
candidate they proffered would bo able
to command a goodly bank roll. But the
appearance iu the open of Herbert L.
Mnttcrlee, brother-in-law of J. P. Mor
gnn, as nn active Roosevelt worker;
word from New York that Frank A.
Vanderlip, credited with considerable
influence in the oil group of Wall street
had announced 'for T, R. and knowledge
that J. Ogdeu Armour, of packing house
fame, was a Roosevelt adherent, had the
effoct of weakening tho most potent
argument of the stand patters their
ability to back a candidate with money.
Big Business Against Hughes.
If the gossip along the row is nn in
dex. Bin Business is dead set against
Hughes. Before the old guard came to Perkins declared that only Informal
a full realization that ' Roosevelt . was . conferences had been held with the re
graduolly accumulating business sup- publican leaders so far. lie Intimated
port,, leaders started a back fire move- hia belief in tho rumor that some of
ment against tho justice, holding that the moro radical progressive would in
entirn lack of knowledge as to his posi- sil,t 'i nominating Roosevelt at thw
tion on the tariff, industrial welfare, ! vory s,ttrt of tho convention. This,
preparedness und other big problems of however, probably will be bnlked and
tho day tnado it problematical whether
he could command Big Business support.
ine pmn to Kill otf Hughes with Roose
velt and then to kill off Roosevelt with
a combination of nllies the favorite
sons was in tho making last night. To
day, however, the pussy-footers weren't
go sure that it would hold water.
Meanwhile a small wedge of dissen
sion showed today in the progressive
ranks. The radical progressives, of the
typo of Governor Johnson of California,
want tho progressives to meet on Wed
nesday and name their candidate
which of course would be T. R. within
an hour or so. Then they would sit
back and wait. The conciliatory group
of progressives in Ohio are willing to
wait until tho republicans nominate
even if this takes until Friday or Sat
urday before having the conclave in
the auditorium to choose a standard
benrer. They hold tho third ticket bog
ey would be moat effectually held be
fore tlie republicans if the progressives
sat tight.
Nothing Doing Before Friday.
In nil the pre-convention pussy-footing,
the one definite plan evolved so
far by the old guard ns the Inst line of
defense against stampede for Roosevelt,
is a sudden adjournment after one or
two ballots. It looks now as though the
nominating oratory will be spilled on
Friday. The first roll call on a presi
dential nominee will come afterward. If
T. B. nnd Hughes show big at first and
if either grew perceptibly in two or
threo ballots, Murrny Crane is expect
ed to suggest an ad journment. Then in
the watches of the night, the final ef
fort will be made to agree on the vote
the next day.
Knowledge today that the progres
aixCB had served a virtual ultimatum
that they would not accept Hughes,
since Roosevelt had mnde the isftues nnd
et the icc, served to accelerate per
ceptibly the Weeks boom. His support
ers, who orieinnly cluimed 125 votes on
the first ballot, were asserting 175 to
day and morn on the way.
Boomers for the other favorite sons
were struck with the same optimism.
Five professional glad handers on duty
at the Root headquarters positively ra
diated enthusiasm today.

"IIOIHIII"
LWilHng to Accept Anyone, But
t That One Will Have ta
Be Roosevelt
REPUBLICANS HAVE NOT-
PRODUCED SUCH A MAN
"The Repahlcans Want To
, Win" Said Rowel, They
Must Come To Us" .
By H. L. Rcnniclt.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Chicago, June 3. The progressiva
party is ready nt any time to accept a
republican candidate who "can fill the
place of Theodore Roosevelt." .
Cp to this time, however, the repub
licans have shown no iinnninity on any
candidate, nor havo they provided a
man who can fill Roosevelt's place. -
This stand was outlined today br
George W Perkins, bull moose chieftain.
Ho emphasized the progressives' will
ingness to accept a republican candi
date, but emphasized even nioro tba
belief that Roosevelt, is the only man.
"Wo stand on our Jnnuary state
ment," Perkins said, "that does not
necessarily i.ieau Roosevelt. But tho
word 'necessarily' of necessity implies
thntoHome other man must be produced
who can Till Roosevelt's place. But
there has been no ununmity of opinion
on any republican candidate other than
Roosevelt."
Will H. Childs, of Brooklyn, progres
sive lender, interrupted Perkins to stata
that during the past three months the
sentiment for Roosevelt had grown to
', practical unanimity on the. colonel.
, efforts made to prevent any one from
"going off half cocked."
"We have taken no definite steps
because only about 10 per cent of ths
delegates arc now here," Perkins snid.
" Something definite toward a confer
once with tho republicans may bo ac
complished early next week."
Chester A. Rowell, progressive nation
al committeeman from California, took
practically the same stand as Perkins.
He said ho was not speaking for Gov
ernor Johnson, but that hn personally
believed the republicans had, so far,
brought out no acceptable substitute
for Roosevelt.
"The republicans wnnt to win," said
Rowell. "They must como to us."
