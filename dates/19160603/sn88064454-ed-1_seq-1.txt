COLUIBIAN
WOODIEN
The Columbian Woodmen had a
big day here Monday, the occa
sion being a visit of Mr. W. A.
Mair, a fraternalist of national
note, from Memphis, Tennessee.
Mr. Mair attended the lodge
meeting where he delivered a lec
ture and with the members dis
cussed some matters pertaining to
the affairs of the order.
After the meeting the members,
headed by the fine band of Brous- I
sard, marched to the School Audi-!
torium, where Mr. Nair delivered I
a masterly address, having for his I
subject, fraternalism, and he hand
led his subject in such eloquent
manner, that the large audience
listened to him with a great deal
of interest.
After the lecture, the members
went to the College Hall where
they enjoyed a splendid supper.

Had Road Graded.
Last Saturday some of our peo
ple who went to New Iberia rea
lized how rough this road was,
Mr. Sidney J. (onsoulin and Mr.
P. A. Bienvenu being victims of
the bad road, thought that some
thing could be done to remedy
this evil. Mr. Gonsoulin in a few
minutes raised the money neces
sary from some of the automobile
owners and Mr. P. A. Bienvenu
made arrangement to have the
road dragged, which was done in
one day, for $8.25 the road from St.
Martinville to the parish line on
the Iberia road, and the road to
the Lake Bridge were made good
and smoth and a pleasure to ride
upon. We believe automobile
owners saved in one day in tire,
the amount that was expended on
this road. This shows if we had
here, as elsewhere, an automo
bile club, when each member
would contribute an equal share,
lots of good could be accomplished
in promoting good roads, which
are so much neglected in this pa
rish.

pine tar balsam heals the raw spots,

tion of the bronchial tubes. Just get a
bottles of Dr. Bell's Pine-Tar-Honey to
day. Its guaranteed to help you. At
druggists.
Thibodau Church Burned
-The fine Catholic Church of
Thibodaux was bestroyed by fire
last week. This church was one
of the finest in the state and was
valued at from $50.000 to $75.000,
with only $6.000 insurance. A
large amount of the valuable fur
nishing of the church was saved.
The cause of the fire is unknown.
The church being outside of the
town, the Waterworks did not ex.
tend that far, and this was perhaps
the reason of the total destruction
of this valuable building. The
church will be rebuilt.
A Laxative Blood Cleanser
Don't put off taklng a treatment of
Po-Do-Lax. Your system needs a clean
ser and toonic-nothing like Po-Do-Lax
to purify the blood, gently move the
bowels and stimulate the liver to heal
thy atlion. The first doese releases the
accumulated poisons. It is a laxative
tonic for young. adult and aged. Its
mild non-gripingl action commends it
to delicate women. Guaranteed-a trial
will convince yea. Get a bottle to-day.
Street and Road Dragged.
Last week the town authorities
after thoroughly and effectively
drag the town, dragged the
Terrace road up to the hills, and
transformed this rough road into a
fine smooth one, which show how
effective is the drag. Three miles
of rough road made smooth for $4
we believe is cheap enough.
