A man came in to my
said:
"What! a 340i) r.p.m. Chalmers at $1090. I
never knew Chalmers built a car under $2,000."
So many ask the same question. We never
feature price in h"g type. We don't sell price.
We sell a car first; then tell how much it costs
afterwards.
I suppose we lose some sales that way. But,
of course, we hero a car of such decided quality,
of such extraordinary ability, of such terrifier
power from an engine that you wonder where it
all comes from— well, we just don't know how to
talk price when so many other things bob up in
our minds.
Now take power. Here it is rated at 25.3
H. P. when you buy your license. You get her
out in mud, or sand, or on a hill—and bing, you
can just double that figure.
You have got just about 100 per cent more
power than we give her credit for.
Of course, lots cf cars have great big power.
But with most of them you've got to pay the
piper every time you use it. Those big power
cars have great big engines mostly, and great big
engines have a terrific appetite for gas. You
know, I don't need to tell you.
This 3400 r. p. m. Chalmers has an engine in
her that's got the kick.
You step on the accelerator button, and zip!
You never saw such spunk.
And not only power, but she gets away like a
scared horse. 1 have to watch my foot when it
is on the little button,
going 00 fast.
First thing I know I am
That's what the boys back at the Chalmers
plant call "acceleiation." I call it "pep."

simply stating the price.
Now it is ail different.
People are buying cars more intelligently.
They want what they call ability. There are too
many cars that look alike and have the same
price tag on them. The only thing that separates
them is ability. There's all the difference in the
wide world between cars when wm look at them
this way.

is sluggish like a ploughing horse.
Another has got a light foot and gets under way
without taking a quarter mile to get into high.
Why, with this 3400 r. p. m. Chalmers I forget
once in a while and actually start her on high.
There aren't many cars that ever do that.
Then she runs so everlastingly quiet I am
always a little bit suspicious of lier — like a fellow
who doesn't talk much, but usually delivers.
She's got anything in this town beat. So far I
have yet to meet her equal in "pep." She's got
everything from get-away to a twister on a hill.
Then when you come right down to look at
her, you will have to admit she's got blue eyes.
She's beautiful.
The big-town people have all fallen for her this
year. I got a letter from the factory the other
day telling me they had shipped 18,000 since
December 1.
And there are thousand of orders unfilled
Take a friendly tip and get your order on file
now. I don't want to see you disappointed by
delayed delivery right in the best part of the driv
ing season.
You folks who have driven a lot will see the
difference in a jiffy. Come on down and t r y her
out. She's there.
