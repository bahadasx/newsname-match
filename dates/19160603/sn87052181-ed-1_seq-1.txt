LOSE ALIMONY ATTHF ALTAR !
Judge Lucas of Kansas City Rulili on
Important Point of State
Divorce Law.
A divorcee cannot expect to collect
alimony or have tho support of two
men, Judgo O. A. Lucas ruled recent
ly at Kansas City. And inndPiitnlly
he decided that when a dlvorceo re
marries, tho alimony allowance of her
first husband automatically ceases
to bo operative.
Tho ruling, tho first of Its kind mado
In Missouri, was mado In tho motion of
Mrs. Ollvo M. NeUon to revlvo and
collect alimony granted her fourteen
years ago when sho was divorced
from JnnioB A. Nelson, of Kansas City.
Mrs. Nelson secured a divorce from
Nelson January 19, Ijl.M. Sho was
granted $35 a month "trhmony. About
eighteen month3 later sho remarried.
Tho plaintiff and her second hus
band lived together about six years.
Then they were divorced. A year
ago James Nelson Inherited the estate
of the late John Nelson, a wealthy
hide dealer. He had remarried.
Ills former wife attempted to col
lect alimony extending over tho four
teen years, with Interest nt G per
cent, amounting in all to $8,700. Judge
Lucas held Mrs. Nelson could collect
alimony for tho time from tho date of
the divorce decrco until her remar
riage. Heretofore a remarriage has been
considered a good reason for a court
order stopping the payment of ali
mony. Judgo Lucas' decision would
make any court action uneccasary.

A bit of history about
Shane O'Neill, the great
Irish Chief who lived and
died fighting "Redshanks"
6&
HEN Elizabeth, queen and
virgin, ruled In England
and Shano O'Neill, hered
itary chieftain, ruled In Ul
ster, the Irish historical
arena presented tho as
pects of a Homeric con
flict. On the ono sido tho
Vw V riol3 wltl1 tllBlr "Bl'tlng
' V ranks illtorsnnrnpil with
bards nnd brelions, strug
gling to save the landmarks of the na
tive civilization. On tho other hand
were tho nstuto Tudor diplomatists
with their deputies and sheriffs, striv
ing to cast til" Imperial net about tho
fair hill and wooded morasses of Ul
ster. Eor both bides tho times wero
critical and each foucht for Its verv
existence In Ireland. Ono defeat in
battle was always llablo to throw tho
native or tho cnrtlo cause out of reck
oning for a generation.
The appearance of Shano O'Neill In
history was in opposition to Mnthew,
tho son of tho carl of Tyrone, whom
tho government had nominated to rule
Ulster. In Jioso days thero wero
castio chiefs Just as in latter days
thero were castio bishops. There was
"the queen's O'Reilly" and tho royal
candidate for tho O'Neillshlp tho su
premo of all Irish titles. Shano
claimed it on his merits as a free
man of tho ruling house and tho clan
rallied round him. Upon the sacred
stono of his raco at Tullyogo in tho
County Tyrono (It is now an Orango
hamlet and tho stono of inaugura
tion has been hammered into frag
ments) Shane was solemnly declared
to be tho O'Neill par excellence. The
O'llagan, his brehon, read out his
claim and title, while the O'Kano, his
Inaugurator, placed a whlto wand In
his band as the scepter of O'Neill
land. So firmly was Shano settled In pop
ular support nnd military strength that
Sidney the deputy was unwilling to ad
venture an attack. For tho time Shano
was left to fortify his castles at Dun
gannon and Ardglass and to recruit his
clansmen. In the following year Sus
sex was mado, deputy with directions
to restore Mathow O'Neill and to com
pel obedience from Shano "either by
fair means or foul." Sussex had not
tho troops to venture on an Ulster
campaign, which In thoso days was a
combination of forest and guerrilla
warfare. Uls'or was England's Mex
ico. There was a rivalry of chiefs
and English policy was to recognlzo
one against tho other. Sussex endeav
ored to rouse tho O'Reilly and tho
O'Donuell against O'Neill. Shano was
not unprepared Ho crushed O'Reilly
with tho help of Scotch mercenaries
or "Redshanks," as they wero called
(doubtless they wore kilts and showed
raw, wind-bitten knees). O'Donncll
ho carried off with his wifo Into cap
tivity. The deputy had no courso left
but to essay a military adventure him
self. The effect was disastrous. His
dispatch from tho field is still extant
in the state papers and has a quality
of the frank and personal note not dis
coverable in tho'nmblguous dispatches
of modern warfare.
"Never before," wroto Sussox,
"durst Scot or Irish look an English
man in tho face In plain or wood, and
now Shano hath with 120 horses, nnd
a few Scots and gallowglass charged
one whole array the fnnfo of tho Eng
lish army, so hardly gotten is now
vanished and I wrecked and dishon
ored by other men's deeds."
Tho deputy's next stop was to dis
honor himself oven moro signally by
his own deed. Ho bribed Shuno's mes
senger to slay lib lord, but tho plan
miscarried. Tho fidelity of tho clan
stood like a burnished cuirass between
tho O'Neill end tho enemies of O'Neill,
foreign or native. By this time, tho
"Annals of tho Four Masters" tell us,
Shane hnd "assumed tho sovereign
command of all Ulster from Droghoda
to the Erno, so that he might bo called
the provisional king of Ulster." Eliz
abeth was bouud to treat htm ns an
equul and when ho suggested n parley
In London, a safe-conduct was for
warded under tho royal sign-manual.
Shano set forth with his rctlnuo of
bard, brehon, and gallowglass and en
tered tho English capital In semi
regal stato, much to tho wonder of
Clan London. Ho was perfectly will
ing to recognlzo Elizabeth as sov
ereign of Ireland, but ho would not bo
pestered by her deputies and ho in
sisted on bolng recognized himself as
tho O'Neill In all privileges and trib
utes thereto appertaining. Tho cour
tlors made great play of his preten
sions and dubbed him "O'Neill tho
Education Not Worth While.
"You can't make mo bellovo a col
logo education gits you anything,"
said tho young man who had won two
medals for fox trotting. "Still I al.
ways thought college fellows was aw
ful swell," repllod tho girl. "Nothln1
doln'l Wo got ono of them in our of
Uco that always says 'whom' and
'notwlthsta,ndln owl say, I hoard the
boss callln' him down today tho worst
t over seen. What's tho uso knowln'
them kind of words It you cun't talk
back ?" Judgo.
1 ILVVL
Great, cousin to St. Patrick, friend to
the queen of England, enemy to all
tho world beside."
Shano was excessively busy In
London. Ho plotted cheerfully with
tho Spanish ambassador, which throw
tho foreign ministry into alarm, and
ho so Impressed the queen that sho
was willing he should remain
"O'Neill," though sho continued to
retain her own candidate up her
sleeve.
On his return to Ireland Shano set
about Invading Tlrconnoll as tributary
to tho O'Neill As a matter of fact
the O'Donnoll had been declared ex
empt from his levies, but Shano could
not keep his bauds out of tho heredi
tary feud between CInel-Connal and
Clnel Owen. It was a feud so per
manent and intenso in Irish history
that the Scnachles declared Owen and
Connal had been born at grips with
ono another. It ' as a feud that was
to lose Shano the O'Nelllship and to
lose Ireland Ulster. For tho time In
deed Sussox was glad to keep the
peaco and bide his time. Tho nnmo
of "O'Neill" was confirmed to Shano
"until the queen should decorate him
by another more honorable name."
To consolidate tho peaco and to
colobrato tho agreement, Sussex sent
a cask of wine to Dungannon, from
which Shano most unwisely essayed to
drink tho queen's health. As a result
ho and his chief gentlemen found
themselves temporarily poisoned;
Shane remonstrated with some Indig
nation, but it was tho carrier of the
wino nnd not Sussox who was impris
oned for tho offense. Meanwhile,
Shane continued to rulo Ulster, but
not by any means as a successful ban
dit rules tho valleys from his throne
upon tho mountains. Poets and men
of literature wero supported under his
patronage.
Shane's undoing proceeded not
from the castle, but from himself. In
on evil hour ho remembored ho had
onco promised to treat tho mercenary
Scots as though they wero his own en
emies. His promise to tho queen,
coupled witli some unnoyanco at tho
position of the MccDonnells had ac
quired In Antrim, brought him Into ac
tion. At Glenflcsk ho routed tho Red
shanks nnd slow Angas and Sucmus
MacDonnell. Carried away by IiIb
own success, ho proceeded to Bweep
Ulster as with a broom. The earl of
Klldarn ho thrust out of Dundrum nnd
Bagenal out of Newry. Sidney, who
was once more deputy, mado some ef
fort to parley, but Shano's pride spoke
out in historic utterance. Nover was
a saner or moro honorable or proud
er speech made by an nssortcr of Irish
freedom. It well befitted ono whom
tho annalists '-lied 'Shane an Dlomas,
tho proud."

mine. With the sword I won them,
with tho sword I will keep them."
But Shane's last hour was on the
scales of destiny. His overbearing
ways had won him more serious foes
In Ulster itself than in England. Ger
aldincs, Magulres, and O'Donnells
hemmed him in on every side. Ho
was compelled to retreat to his last
fortress on tho banks of Lough Ncagh
the sacred lake of the O'Neills. This
fortress ho genially christened Fuath
na Gall (hato of tho foreigners)! In
his extremity he was compelled to
make alliance with his old enemies
tho Redshanks. Beforo they could
como to his assistance ho bad been
routed by tho nvenglng O'Donnells.
Tho Four Masters' record the last
battlo of Shane O'Neill called the
Proud:
"However, tho Clnel-Owon (O'Neills)
wero at length defeated by dint o
fighting and forced to abandon tho
field, atid retreat by the way they
had come. It was not easy, for tho
tldo had flowed Into tho Fearsad, but
tho fierceness of tho people who wero
in pursuit of them compelled them to
face It. Eagerly they plunged into
tho swollen sea nnd a countless num
ber were drowned In tho deep full
tldo. O'Donnelly, O'Neill's own foster
brother, and the person most faithful
and dear to htm, was slain, and Brian
O'Neill and his brother and MacDon
nell, O'Neill's constable."
It was a disastrous day for Ireland,
for O'Donnell's victory was England's.
O'Neill fled across Ulster to Cushen.
dun, whero he met the MacDonnell,
who had como at his summons out of
Scotland. Tho MacDonnolls prepared
him a banquet. But high words aroso
between his followers nnd tho Scots,
and Shano was cut down by claymores
as ho left tho table. Tho greatest dan
ger to England's rulo in Ireland had
been obviated by an accidental brawl.
Tho body of Shano, covered only by a
kern's shirt, wna flung into tho old
church hard by.
A frenzy of Joy swept across tho
Channel at the news of his death. An.
act of parliament was passed .pro
claiming tho blood of O'NolU to bo
"corrupt and disabled forovor." All
tho rights and tributos and jurisdic
tions of tho O'Neill wero swept aside.
O'Neill land passed Into tho queen's
gift nnd was conferred on Turlough,
O'Neill -as tho nominee of tho crown.
Such had been tho terror of Shane's
nemo nnd Buch tho power of his red
hand that the old geographers solemn
ly marked on tho ordnance, survey o'f
tho tlm'o In tho northeast corner or
Ireland:
"Hero Shano O'Nlal was slayno,"
S. U
Murderous.
Mrs. Nowmarrlo (sorrowfullyt after
departure of her husband's rich uncle)
"It's too bad tho djnner was 'a. fail
ure, dear." Mr. Newmarre "But It
wasn't a failure, darling. It took at
least a year from unclo's 11 to."
Superlative Goodness. '
To Ioyo tho public, to study univer
sal good, and to, promote tho interests
of tho whole world, as far as lies with

nos, nnd makes that temper which,
we call divine. Shaftesbury.
