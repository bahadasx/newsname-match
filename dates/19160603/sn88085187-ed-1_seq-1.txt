MISS LILLIAN BFXFFI.DT THOMPSON.
Are you a grouch. Do you take pride in the fact that you
never smile? If you arc and do, did you ever stop to iln.il>
of the effect your mental attitude has upon your friends, your
health ami business?
Stop your scowling a minute ami listen to Ibis. The Times
believes that right now when half tl.e world is at war. human
ity h»s learned more Ihan ever lo ai.i.reclau- the simple com
fort of a smile. For that reason we are going to give our
readers a series of four stories on "The Psychology of tl.e
• Smile."
Miss Lillian ltenfel.lt Thompson, a San Francisco girl,
whose smile und beauty have made her famous, is the author.
She is fully qualified to write on smiling. After a three
months' contest in which thousands of girls were entered, .Miss
Thompson was chosen by a committee of itrlists and beauty
fudges as the "Typical California Girl," and as such she rcigne.l
as (Jueen of the Prosperity Ball during tl.e celebration of
Prosperity Week.
At the exposition last yenr she.wns picked out of a group
of San Francisco's prettiest girls as lhe most beautiful In the

expert of the movies.
Harrison Fisher, artist, wanted her to 0000 for his works,
but her parents would not pet nut her to grace tl.e pages of the
iiiaga/.ines.
And with all this and much more to her credit, she is not
spoiled. That means, of course, that she has brains as well
as beauty.
Bead her stories on why she believes in tbe smile as a
panacea for human ills, and we believe your day and the days

Minority IU-|Hirt Coining.
Under the proposed naval pro
gram the oil-burning vessels of
the navy would consume marly
two million barrels of fuel oil &

Tlie worst feature of the grab*
is that the courts have already
declared that these claimant!
have no shadow of title and
nothing except the power of tho
oil Interests and the support they
have received from Secretary
i.ane and Senator I'helan gives
the legislation any standing.
This is sufficient, however, lo
make very probable its passage
unless Influence! can be brought
to bear to head It off. The plan
flt present is to bring it up Im
mediately in tlie senate and to
jam it through at any cost..

The I'helan bill seeks to set
