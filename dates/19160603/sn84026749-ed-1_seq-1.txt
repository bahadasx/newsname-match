Great Battle, Plus Chicago Preparedness Pa
rade, Seized Upon
' Colonel's Stock ;
His Enemies.
l " By JUDSON C.
CHICAGO, June 3. The naval battle in the North
Sea, plus the great Chicago preparedness parade, today
hoisted Roosevelt stock.
London is described as "stunned" by the realization
that the British navy had sustained a great disaster in a crash
of the capital fleets.
It can just as candidly be said that Chicago was stunned,
too. Standpatism was stunned. The Old Guard was horri
fied. The irreconcilable anti-Roosevelt people were shocked.
"Roosevelt luck" more than eminent irreconcilable
denominated it. There was no blinking at the siutation. If
fates could have possibly conspired to make German effi
ciency serve the Roosevelt fortunes at this juncture, they
did in that naval battle.

CHICAGO, June 3. That the nation

WELL1VER.
STILL APPRECIATED.-
It Is yet too early fpr, tho full sig
nificance of the naval engagement to bo
fully appreciated. It may be more or
less Important than It now appears.
But this la accepted as certain:
That Germany has como off beat In a
tlrst class fight, and that from this time
forward the naval status must be re
garded as moro nearly equal than ever
before.
Suppose Germany should win? Thero
Is no gainsaying that the danger of
American Involvement would be vastly
Increased. Germany has long been re
garded as determined, If she should bo
strong enough to carry out her real
purpose, to punish America for selling
war necessaries to tho allies.
There is good reason for tho state
ment that If Gcmany wins she will as
sess penalties against tho United States
for every piece of war material that has
been sent to the allies, and will insist
that a huge Indemnity be paid: an
Indemnity probably of billions. That
sccmod a pretty Improbable prospect,
so long as the British navy controlled
tho sea, but It Is different now.
Just In the measure that there Is real
danger of this country being dragged
Into tho war, to that extent tho need for
uooBeveirs leadership is moro im
pressed. Min who would not accept under any
othor conditions aro admitting that In
such a condition the country would have
to draft him because he Is the one
man best equipped to handle such a
situation.
Tho next twenty-four hours will de
termine how much tho effect of this
naval development Is going to effect
politics. '
Indications here at this moment are
that the new turn In tho war will be
profoundly Impressive. Tho demand for
Koosevelt Is demanded more confidently
than ever before by tho people who
iimxe Americanism and preparedness.

Dr. Sun Yat Sen, China's Man of Destiny, is ready today to strike again for
the Republic of China. His troops are ready for mobilization.
Yuan Shi Kai's power is waning. But until a little jade idol is returned to
him, Dr. Sun will not strike.
How the idol was stolen, how the search for it radiated from Washington,

REICHSTAG GETS REPORT
Admiral Soheer Claims Great
Triumph Over British in
First General Engagement.
BERLIN, June 3. England's claim
to the mastery of the sea Is broken.
This Is the German view resulting
from the victory of the fleet of "Vice
Admiral Scheer, which has given the
Kaiser's name as brilliant a tradition
as Is written on the pages of any
naval power.
Flags were displayed everywhere
today In celebration of the long-expected
clash with the British high
seas fleet and the German success.
Schools were dismissed, special serv
ices of celebration and thanksgiving
were called, and German enthusiasm
was aroused as ut no time since the
Kaiser's army was drawing near Paris
early In the war.
Thirty-four Battleships Engaged.
At least thirty-four groat British
battleships were engaged in the fight
with the German squadron off Skag
erak. '
This was announced today In a com
munication frum Vice. -Admiral Heb
blnghaua. The roport of Admiral Hebblngaua,
read In tho Reichstag, declared:
"On the afternoon of May 31 part
of our fleot engaged In combat with
a very superior British fleet of at
least thirty-four modern great bat
tleships. "Tho battle went on until 9 p. m.,
when It became dark, nnd during the
night a series of single cruiser and
torpedo boat attacks took place.
"The result of these connected en
gagements Is a very satisfactory sue
cons of our fleet against a much
stronger adversary.
"It was ascertained that the losses
of tho British, T.n:ch were partly
confirmed by rescued British sailors,
are the Warsplte, Indefatigable, and
Queen Mary, two armored cruisers of
the Achilles type; one small cruiser,
and destroyers: flagships Turbulent,
Nestor, and Alcaiter; and, further,
nine or ten destroyers' of whom our
battleship Wcstfollen alone sank six
during tho night attacks."
Reports German Losses.
The report continued that the Ger
man losses Included the Pommern and
Wiesbaden, and several torpedo boats.
Admiral Hebblnghaus mentions that
the cruiser Frauenlob was seen by a
torpedo boat to be heeling during the
night, so that she must be considered
lost.
The crews and materlels of tho fleet
proved excellent.
The navy Is In brilliant spirits, the
admiral reported.
Although no official expression was
obtainable It was evident that the
sea victory is regarded here as an
other step toward a possible early
peace.
Defeat of the British fleet the first
time It felt Germany's naval power;
the fact that German territory Is clear
of the enemy; that Belgium and north
ern France aro successfully held, while
the French and British line have re
mained stationary for the last year,
and that the Crown Prince Is hammer

SENATOR TILLMAN.
10 BE AUTHORIZED
Two dreadnaughts, one battle cruiser,
and a llotllla of dirigibles the equiva
lent of Zeppelins will be added by the
Senate to the naval program Indorsed
by tho House an a result of lessons
from the North Sea naval battle. Chair
man Tillman, of the Senate Naval Com
mittee, said today.
He spent all the forenoon at the Navy
Department, discussing the battle with
naval experts.
When ho returned to tho CApltol he
gave the United Press an outline of
what changes he plans to make In the
Houso bill.
"The first lesson," he said, "Is that
battle cruisers can't fight drcadnaughts.
They aren't Intended to. At long ranga
on the open ocean, where their speed
would mako them hard to hit and
whero they could maneuver as they
pleased, they might bo successful.
"The second lesson Is that the fleet
which attacks with powerful ships on
tho ocean, submarines under tho ocean,
nnd Zeppelins, or some powerful, speedy
dlrlglblo baloon. can beat the fleet
which consists mostly of surface boats.
"So I shall recommend to my com
mittee two dreadnaughts to bo built at
once, where the House provided none.
I bcllevo wo should add another battle
cruiser, and oven then we won't hare
as many as other first-class naval pow
ers. Wo must have dirigibles as good
as the German Zeppelins a flotilla of
them, and we must have moro aircraft
of all kinds.
"Another lesson unless a ship is
as good as the best, It Isn't any good
at all. It's bound to be flunk, with
nil Its bravo men, Its valuable ma
chinery, and Its fine guns. The ships
my committee will authorize will be
as good as any In the world."
