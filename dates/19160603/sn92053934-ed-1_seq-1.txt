Germans Drive Way Into
French Stronghold on
Verdun Front,
PARIS ADMITS LOSS
Statement Confesses Victory
of Teutons Still Hold
the Interior?
Tans. June ". (12:30 p. m.) In the
course of repeated and violent attacks
last night on Fort Vaux, on. the Ver
dun front east of the Meuse, the Ger
mans penetrated a deep ditch north of
the main French position. The In
terior of the works, the war office an
nouncement of today says, is still held
by the French.
Except for this pain, the statement
Bays, the Germans were repulsed with
heavy losses.
Spirited fighting continued in the
Argonne, west of the Verdun sector.
Two German attacks west of La Fille
Morte were beaten hack.
French War Report.
The text of the communication fol
lows: "In the Champagne district to the
west of Mont Petu, certain detach
ments of the enemy who, following an
intense bombardment had penetrated
some of our minor defense posts were
dislodged by counter attacks in which
hand grenades were used.
"In the Argonne district yesterday
evening a German attack on a salient
of our line to the west of La Mile
Morte was repulsed after a fairly spir
ited encounter. A second attack at
about 8 p. m. also was completely
checked.
"On the left bank of the river Meuse
our positions from Hill No. 3"4 to our
second line have been subjected to a
violent bombardment.
"On the right bank of the river, the
fighting is going on in the sector of
Fort Vaux with the same ferocity as
before. All the onslaughts of the en
emy upon our trenches to the west
and to the east of the fort have been
repulsed.
"Again the fort itself the Germans
multiplied their furious assaults and
this in spite of the heavy losses
caused in their ranks by the fire of
our artillery and of our machine guns
which each time forced our adversar
ies back. Nevertheless during the
night certain detachments of the en
emy were successful in penetrating a
deep ditch north of the fort. In the
interior of the position we are main
taining ourselves with energy."
Battle at Its Highest ritch.
The battle of Verdun reached a
point of unprecedented Tiolence in the
last 4S hours. The Germans made a
formidable effort to mass reinforce
ments on the right bank of the Mouse,
supported by a great number of heavy
pieces drawn from other fronts.
The concentration of the German
forces is taken here to indicate a su
preme attempt to bring the long drawn
out attack on the fortress to a suc
cessful issue and to prevent a general
offensive by the allies. Despite the in
tensity of the attack involving enorm
ous losses, the French official accounts
say that the main lines are not essen
tially changed. The furtberest point
reached by the Germans was houses
on the outskirts of Damloup. The
main portion of the town is strongly
held by the French.
German War Report.
Berlin, June S, (via London, 5:55 p.
m.) The ridges of the heights south
east of Zillebeke, southeast of Ypres,
Belgium and the British position be
yond have been captured by storm by
German troops, the war ofliee an
nounced today. During the early hour(
this morning a strong attack against
the recently won position of the Ger
mans southwest of Caillette wood was
repulsed, says the statement French
attempts to storm trenches southwest
of Vaux failed with sanguinary losses
for the French. The statement also
said that in the Champagne south of
Hipont, a German reconnoitering de
tachment brought in more than 200
French prisoners as the result of a
small hostile incursion.
West of the Meuse the enemy's bat
teries and fortified positions were
shelled with visible success and east
of the Meuse the French suffered a
further reverse, said the statement.

THE WAR TODAY
Fuller details of the gTeat naval
battle off Horns reef in the North
sea emphasizes the advantage
gained by the Germans in indict
ing heavy tosses on the liritish
tleet while escaping with consid
erably smaller damage them
selves. German estimates of the tonnage
destroyed plaee it at 133.000 tons
on the British and 23.000 on the
German side. The German fig
ures, however, prohahly are bas
ed on the assumption that the
Itritih battleship Warspite was
among the vessels sunk. The
British admiralty, however, has
officially denied that this 27,500
ton vessel was lost.
It has not appeared from any
of the accounts that the British
main battleship tleet was actually
engaged. Four battleships, how
ever, were Jn the tleet that sup
ported the battle eruiser squad
ron. This speedy collection of
warships is supposed to have at
tempted to cut off the retreat of
the German tleet.
The naval hattle in the North
sea last Wednesday afternoon and
Germany resulted in a victory for
the German tleet, according to de
tails made known. The British
lost at least 1 1 warships, inclnd
intr three battle cruisers, three
cruisers and eight torpedo boats,
while the German loss was at
least one batteship, two small
cruisers and a number of torpedo
boats.
The Germans claim in addition
to the admitted loss of Great Brit
ain that the warship Wanspite, of
the largest type in the liritish
navy was sunk, that the battle
ship Marlborough was hit by a
torpedo and that two cruisers of
the Achilles type and one subma
rine were sent to the bottom.
The British admiralty adds to
the co needed losses by Germany
two dreadnonghts of the kaiser
class vessels of 21,700 tons de
stroyed, the blowing up of one
battle cruiser, the damaging of
two other vessels of this class and
the sinking of a German subma-
rinP- ,.
The fightine near ton Vanx.
northeast of Verdun is described
by 1'aris as being of unprecedent
ed tiolence. The French tore
great holes in the German ranks
and forced them back.
The Germans, however, cap
fared a portion of the village of
Fort Vaux.
(In the Kussian front the Ger
mans are again bombarding the
Ikskull bridgehead.
Desperate fighting is still in
progress between the Italians and
Austrian between the Adigo and
Kreiila rivers. Along the Posina
and southeast of Arsiero, Austrian
attacks were repulsed with heavy
casualties.
The Turks claim the Russian
center in the Caucasus region has
been forced (o retire 20 kilometres

FOREIGN COMMENT
ON NAVAL DISASTER
IN THE NORTH SEA
Amsterdam, via London, June 3.
The Berlin newspapers, commenting
on the naval battle off Jutland declare
that the German navy longed fervently
for this sea battle for 22 months. Ad
miral von Hofe describes the battle in
the following manner:
"The German high . sea fleet was
steaming northward with its scouts
pushed forward in all directions when
the British high sea fleet appeared
from the direction of Scotland in full
strength and confident that it was
about to gain the mastery of the North
sea. Great Britain's allies had clearly
pointed out the inadequacy of her
blockade and demanded stronger pres
sure. "Great Britain's first step was to
send out the fleet but as in the action
of January, 1915, German skill and ac
curate tiring stood the test in squad
ron action against the heavy calibre
guns of the British dreadnoughts.
"The German torpedo flotillas first
successfuly attacked the British ships
of line. Several engagements took
place and the British used their su
periority in. an attempt to cut off the
retreat of the Germans to the south
with their fastest and strongest armed
units.
"They also attacked continuously
during the night by sudden dashes of
their torpedo flotillas. That the Ger
man torpedo defenses worked splen
didly is shown by the heavy losses in
curred by the British flotillas."
Captain von Kuhl Jetter, writing in
the Lokal Anzeiger estimates the total
German losses at 23,000 tons and the
British losses at 133,000 tons, with the
loss in big ships at 13,000 tons for the
Germans and 103,000 for the British.
The Tages Zeitung says regarding
the naval battle in the North sea:
"Taking into consideration the tre
mendous resources of modern naval
warfare and the fact that other blue
jackets had the main force of the Eng
lish battle fleets before them, our fleet
behaved brilliantly. To the loss of
three of the strongest English
dreadnoughts, no adequate German
loss is opposed. Moreover, the suc
cess was obtained against a consider
able numerical superiority. Our young
navy showed a tremendous intrinsic
superiority over the first and largest
fleet in the world."
London. June 3 The morning news
papers, while admitting the serious
nature of the British loss in the naval
battle off Jutland, uniformly suggest
that the battle cannot possibly have
any adverse effect oo the naval situa
tion. Most editorials moreover, de
clare that in its ultimate effect that
battle must rank as a British victory
because the Germans were finally com
pelled to flee owing to the arrival of
the British main fleet on the scene of
action.
Dunne Urges
AllMarchers
to Join Army
Springfield, 111., June 3. Men fit for
military service who march in pre
paredness parades today but do not
enlist in the national guard are flying
false colors in the opinion of Govern
or Edward F. Dunne. The governor
issued a statement here today calling
on the young men, of the state to en
list. "In Chicago and" in Springfield im
pressive demonstrations are being
made today by patriotic citizens to ex
press their conviction that our coun
ty out to prepare adequately for na
tional defense," said the governor in
his statement.
"Thousands will march in proces
sions to place themselves publicly on
record as ready for the sacrifices nec
essary to maintain an adequate
trained fighting force.
"To every marcher I have a mes
sage. The time for your sacrifice has
come. You have announced yourself
as ready for it, and the nation i-nd
state expect you to make it. The pres
ent membership of the Illinois nation
al guard is about 7,000. The new law
will increase this to 21,000. It is well
known that the old strength has been
difficult to maintain. To treble it, as
Illinois is in honor bound to do, will
require the cooperation of all classes
of citizens. Young men of military
physique must enlist; their parents
and employers in every way possible
must encourage them.
"When the parade is over do not
think you have done your part toward
preparedness. You have only ex
pressed your willingness to do it.
"Illinois patriotism will be reckoned
not by the number of marchers in pre
paredness parades, but by the strength
and efficiency of its national guard and
the number of recruits furnished to
the enlarged regular army. So 1
would urge upon all preparedness
marchers, go when you break ranks to
the headquarters of a national guard
regiment and enroll your name for
enlistment
"I wish to express my confidence
that Illinois business men mean what
they say and that our quota of the na
tional defense force will be enlisted
without delay and even exceeded. But
I wish to emphasize that the marcher
in a preparedness parade who, is of
military age does not enlist, or. in any
employer beyond that age, does not
persuade others to enlist, is flying
false colors and pretending to a pat
riotism he does not possess."

CHICAGO HAVING
PREPARE PARADE
Estimated It Will Take 19 Honrs For
All of Marchers to Tass a
Given Point.
Chicago, June 3. The great
Chicago preparedness parade start
ed at 9 o'clock this morning.
Marching 16 abreast, according to tab
ulations by a corps of clerks organ
ized for the purpose, 2,032 paraders
passed the reviewing stand in the first
12 minutes. It is said that at this
rate all of the 200000 persons who
enrolled on the parade books could
not march, even if the pace set by the
vanguard could be maintained, unless
the demonstration were continued far
into the night.
Roughly estimated on the base of
the first 12 minutes, it would require
19 hours for the parade to pass a
given point. If they marched with
out stopping for any purpose it would
be 4 o'clock tomorrow morning be
fore the demonstration was over. The
weather was perfect
Grant park, the big downtown play
ground, was black with spectators
when the great line began to stir along
the 3 miles of its length. Trains
from the suburbs and neighboring
states poured their loads through the
citys' gateways to mingle with the j
holiday throng gathered from every
nook and cranny of the city. No ac
curate estimate of the crowd was pos
sible. It has been placed at a mil
lion. Every bit of space was taken
and nearly everybody carried flags or
at least coat lapel emblems.
Throughout the city homes, busi
ness offices and factories were vivid
with patriotic colors. Two thousand
five hundred policemen, practically
the entire day force of the police de
partment, were engaged in keeping
clear the line of march and handling
the crowds. The parade itself was
managed from a central telephone of
fice in direct connection with 126 sub
stations. Thus General E. C. Young,
I. N. G., grand marshal, through Cap
tain Sheldon, his aide, was able at all
times to maneuver the various great
divisions.
All branches of the city's lifeTere
represented and all nationalities from
straight Yankee. English, French, Ger
man, Austrian, Russian, Italian, Greek
all of Europe and parts of Asia.
Many women were in line and there
were millionaires, too, heads of Chi
cago's greatest industries, who were
not content to arrange for the appear
ance of their employes, but insisted
on enrolling themselves. Samuel In
sull, president of the Commonwealth
Edison company, which supplies most
of the city's electricity, was one of
these.
Pes .Moines Having Parade.
Des Moines, la., June 3. More than
5,000 persons, it was announced today,
have signed their names to the parade
petition and will take part in the pre
paredness demonstration to be held
here this afternoon. H. H. Polk, grand
marshal of the parade, said he expected
that at least double the number of
signed would take part in the parade.
More than 1,000 women have signified
their intention to march.

Revision of
NeutralLaw
Is Proposed
Washington, Jane 3. General re
vision of American neutrality laws
was proposed to congress today in a
memorandum submitted by Attorney
General Gregory and concurred it by
the state ,4eBartment.as a result of the
government's experience with prob
lems arising out of the war and of
relations with Mexico.
Enactment of 18 new laws is recom
mended to correct defects in, existing
statutes, to cover present omissions of
law "for the observance of obligations
imperatively imposed by international
law upon the United States," and to
make crimes against American neu
trality punishable under federal laws.
At present many such acts do not
violate federal criminal law.
Almost every phase of activity in the
United States on behalf of foreign gov
ernments, which has resulted in fed
eral prosecution under the broad
charge of conspiracy would be made
specifically criminal by the proposed
legislation. In addition, the powers of
the president would be broadened
with respect to withholding clearances
to suspected vessels, further employ
ment of the land and naval forces to
preserve neutrality, imposing a more
rigid censorship upon wireless anl
cable messages to belligerent coun
tries and seizing arms and ammuni
tion about to be exported in violation
of an embargo.
One of the proposed laws would
authorize collectors of customs or oth
er persons, duly empowered by the
president, to inspect foreign private
vessels in American ports for the pur
pose of "investigating and detecting
any use or attempted use," of the ves
sels in violation of neutrality laws.
The use of such vessels as a place of
resort for conspirators against Amer
ican neutrality would also be made a
crime. Another law would make crim
inal, certain activities here, of for
eign spies.

NAVAL CLASH
BIG FEATHER
FOR GERMANS
Teuton Officials Highly Sat
isfied With Victory in
the North Sea.
WARSPITE NOT SUNK?
London Admiralty Denies
Loss of Giant Craft
England in Gloom. t
London, June 3, (11:10 a.
m.) The admiralty received
a report today to the effect
that Captain Prowse, com
mander of the Queen Mary
and the entire personnel of
that battle cruiser were lost.
According to estimates here, .
which in the absence of official
figures can only be conjectured,
the British losses in men most be
somewhere in the neighborhood of
.',000. It is similarly estimated
that the German losses were at
least between 2,000 and 3,000 men.
No attempt is made here to min
imize the seriousness of the Brit
ish losses in ships and men and
that according to present infor
mation the German fleet had the
best of the action. Strong hopes .
are entertained, , however, that
later reports may minimize the
seriousness of this British naval
setback.
The greatest regret Is felt here
over the loss of the battlecruiser
Queen Mary, which was one of the
show ships of the British navy.
She was only completed at Jar
row in 1913. Her crew numbered
abont 1,000 men. The other
cruisers were older ressels.
The British admiralty stated
today that the battleship .Marl
borough was hit by a torpedo, but
was towed safely to port.
The dreadnought Warspile was
damaged by gunfire, the admir
alty added, but escaped torpedoes.
The German dreadnought West
falen of 18,600 tons has been add
ed to the steadily growing list of
vessels snnk in the great naval
engagement off the Jutland coast,
according to a wireless dispatch
from Berlin which says the Ger
man admiralty admits the loss of
this warship.
Additions earlier in the day
were the German cruiser Elbing,
displacing between 4.000 and 5,000
tons, and the British destroyer
Shark. Nearly all the men who
manned the destroyer were lost.
Berlin, June 3, (by wireless front
a staff correspondent of the Associated
Press, via Sayville, N. Y.) The first
naval battle on a grand scale during
the present war has been attended by
results which, according to the infor
mation received here, are highly sat
isfactory to the Germans, not only in
respect of the comparative losses of
the two fleets but in the fact that the
Germans maintained the field after the
battle. This is shown, German com
mentators assert, by the rescue of Brit
ish survivors.
The full German high seas fleet was
engaged under personal command of
Vice Admiral Schecr, the energetio
German commander who succeeded Ad
miral von Pohl. The British fleet is
now estimated at approximately twice
as strong in guns and ships as that
under Admiral Scheer.
Battle Near Norway.
Detailed reports have not yet been
received but the main engagement ap
parently occurred about 125 miles
southwest of the southern extremity of
Norway and 150 miles off the Danish
coast. The battle was divided into two
sections. The day engagement began
at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon and
continued until darkness, or about 9
o'clock. This was followed by a serie3
of separate engagements through the
night.
The exact ranges and course of the
day fight have not been ascertained.
It is assumed the ranges of the day en
gagement were not extreme, possibly
at a distance of about eight miles as
the weather was hazy.
The German torpedo boats and de
stroyers were more effective than the
British, accounting to a considerable
extent for the successes for the Ger
mans against an overwhelmingly su
perior force. It is understood the
Queen Mary and the Indefatigable were
both sunk in the day battle. It has
not been learned when the Warspite
and the other British warships went
