SENATOR TILLMAN POINTS OFT
LESSONS LEARNED FROM
EIGHT; DREADNACGHTB
NEEDED.
WASHINGTON, June 3 Two
dreadnaughta. a battle cruiser and
t'otilla of dirigibles equivalent to Zep
pelins, will be added to the senate na
val program as a result of the lessons
Horn the Skaerak oattle, Chairman
Tfllman has announced.
Tillman cnant (Iik fnrenoon in the'
BOVy department discussing the battle
with naval experts. He said the first
lesson of the fight was that battle
cruisers can not fignt aTeadnaughts.
Second, that a fleet which attacks
with powerful ships on the ocean, sub
marines beneath and dirigibles over
head, can beat a fleet consisting of
surface boats.
Tillman said: "We shall recom
mend two dreadnaughts where the
house provided none. We should add
anotner Dattie cruiser, we must nave
dirigibles as good as the Zeppelins, a
Elotilla or mem
We must have more
aircraft of all kinds. Another lesson
is that unless a ship is aa good as the
best it isn't any good at all. It is
bound to be sunk with all her men,
valuable machinery and fine guns."
Tillman's committee will study the
battle with navy officially informally.
Daniels indicated today it may be
necessary for the government to man
ufacture airships. American manufac
turers practically refus navy orders
because of big profits obtained from
the allies.

British warships turned and steamed

whether they were British or German.
