NAVAL GUNS SERVE
IMPORTANT PURPOSE
Paris. .Tune 2.—rThe use of naval
guns ashore in the present war. it is
pointed out by a naval expert, is not
a mere expedient, resulting from acci
dental or incidental circumstances,
but ss a well defined reason in the
greater initial speed of the projectile
of a naval gun and the consequently
longer range than that of field artil
lery. The new services they render
are due to the aeroplane, which gives
the gunner on lond longer ranges of
fire than he used to get.
The 15-inch naval guns with which
the Germans occasionally bombard
Dunkirk and Nancy are believed to be
from ships lying idle In the Kiel car
nal. They are utilized because they
carry farther than the big mortars.
The type of. the naval guns would
have been more commqnly used on
land for field work had it not been so
much heavier and more difficult to
manipulate than the shorter range
field and siege guns Seven inch to
eight inch naval pieces may be
mounted on railroad trucks, but the
recoil of the larger calibres Is so
violent as to require a solid concrete
foundation.

Items of expense amounting to
about $3,000 have been lopped off the

Comparison of Tonnage is Most Significant—Many Ships
Were Sunk, and Practically Entire Crews Lost
on Both Sides in the Naval Fight.
London. June 3.—Fuller details of the great naval battle off
Horns' reef In the North Sea emphasise the advantage gained by the
Germans In Inflicting heavy losses upon the British fleet while escap
ing with considerably smaller damage themselves.
GermanH' estimates of tonnage destroyed plaoe it at 1X3,000 tons
on the British side, and 22,000 on the German. German figures, how
ever, arc probably based on the assumption that the British battle
ship Warspltc was among the vessels sunk. Hie British admiralty,
however, lias officially denied that this 27,500 ton vessel was lost.
It. has not appeared from any aooounts that the British main
battleship fleet was actually engaged. Four battleships, however,
were in the fleet that supported the battle cruiser squadron. This
meedy collection of warships Is supposed to have attempted to cut off
the retreat of the German fleet.
Tn this it lost three of its units—the main damage suffered by the
British. Among additions to the list of vessels lost in engagement is
the German cruiser EHMng, and the British destroyer Shark, accord
ing to reports.
The admiralty received a report today to the effect that Oaptaln
Prowse, command or of the Queen Mary and the entire personnel of
that cruiser were lost.
EIGHT SURVIVORS.
The Hook (Via London), June S.—Tlin tug boat Thames, arrived
here today with eight of the crew of the German cruiser FVauenlob,
which was sunk in the naval battle off Jutland. They said the war
ship went to the bottom 10 minutes after she was struck. Nothing
was known of the fate of the remainder of the crow or 350 men.
DREADNAUGHTS SAFE.
I*»ndon, June 3.—Captain William Hall, chief of the intelligence
division of the admiralty, requests the Associated Press to say:
"The German report, of the loss of the Marlborough and War
spite is absolutely untrue. Both these dreadnaughts arc safe in the
harbor."
"The German report that the entire British battle fleet was em
gaged Is equally untrue. A portion of the Rritlsh fleet, much Inferior
to the total battle fleet of the Germans, engaged that, fleet, driving it
back into the harbor. The British control the North Sea."
ADMIRAL HOOD IiOST.
Rear Admiral Horace Hood, who was naval secretary to the first
lord of the admiralty at the outbraak of the war. probably lost hie
life when the battle cruiser Invincible was sunk in the Jutland bat
tle, according to the Times. Admiral Hood was flying his flag on the
Invincible as second in command of the battle cruiser squadron.
SCHER.GR IN COMMAND.
Amsterdam,. June 3.—(Via Iflndon)—Advices from Berlin say
that Vice Admiral Scherer, commander of the German battle fleet,
personally commanded the German forces In the battle o*T Jutland,
while the scout division was under the direction of Vice Admiral
Hipper. The German forces art- considered as the German high seas
fleet, with dreadnaughts, older ships of the Une. Battle cruisers, all
light sea forces at present In the North Sea, torpedo destroyers and
the submarine flotilla.
Tjondon. June 3.—An Exchange Telegraph dispatch from Copen
hagen says the German torpedo boat V-28 was sunk during the naval
engagement. Three survivors who were rescued from a raft br a
Swedish steamship reported all the rest of 102 as lost. According to
this dispatch tlie survivors of V-28 said they believed 20 German tor
pedo boats were destroyed and that the German losses as a whole were
colossal.
SEEJ£ DANISH HARBOR.
london. June S—There was a iwport in circulation, wfckrh lacked'
confirmation, that eight German warships took refuge in .Danish wa
ten* after the North, lien tatM. It was said they were notified to leave
within 24 hours and that the British fleet is waiting for them.
OFFICER LOST.
An official statement given out today shows with few exceptions
all officers on the Invincible, Queen .Mary. Indefatigable. Defense.
Black Prince, lost. All officers of the Warrier except one were saved.
The British admiralty made the following statement to the Asso
ciated Press: "We went out within the enemy waters seeking a light.
Our Inferior fleet engaged, the entire German battle fleet and forced
them to return to harbor and give up any plan of action they may
have contemplated."
The British admiralty announces' the battleship Marlborough was
hit by a torpedo during the North Sea battle, bnt was safely towed In
to port. The drcadnaught Warspito was damaged by gun fire, but es
caped torpedoes. A wireless from Berlin says the German admiralty
admits the loss of the dreadnaught Westfalen.
