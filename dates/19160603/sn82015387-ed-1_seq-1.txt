SUDDEN DEATH GREAT
SHOCK TO THE PEOPLE
Death Caused by Acute In
digestion and Weak Heart.
Worried, Overworked
Last Monday, May 29, 1916, Judge
Joseph B. Lancaster went to Frank
linton, La., to hold the May session
e. the 26th Judicial District Court.
His friends were cohgratulating him
that he was looking much improved,
and the thought of death was far
from the minds of his friends. A
ow months ago he had undergone an
operation for intestinal trouble, that
his surgeons said had been caused
Siby a blow at some time which he did
not remember. The operation was
,entirely successful and the jaudge had
rt esumed his duties on the bench, al
though he had been repeatedly urg
., a to rest until he was fully recov
. fred. Besides his judicial labors he
. .ad actively participated in political
.ampaigns, but the most severe
otrain he had been called upon to
bear was the recent serious illness of
his wife. He was extremely fond
Of his family, and his home life was
the greatest source of happiness to
Tuesday the Judge left the supper
table at the hotel in 'Franklinton
about 7:30 p. m. He jokingly re
' marked, as he arose to leave, "I
haven't eaten it all. I leave the
-rest for you." He went up stairs
to his room and then came doWn
to the writing room. A gentleman
present noticed that he seemed to
be looking for something, and he of
bered him some paper. 'the judge
took up a pen and leaned over to
write the date, "May 30," on a
Voucher. The pen trembled nt his'
Sand and traced a line down the
lpaper as he sank to the floor in an
uneonscious condition, from which
he never recovered. His death was
d to be due to acute indigestion,
4 heart failure. His body was
rought to Covington on the Wednes
day morning train, where it was re
eelved by a delegation of the Knights
of Columbus and the Woodmen of
the World, and taken to his resi
dence, the funeral taking place at
3:30 p. m. Wednesday, services be
i-g conducted by Rev. Jos. Koegerl
at the residence and at St. Peter's
Church. The pallbearers were T. E.
Brewster, Lewis L. Morgan, E. J.
erick, F. J. Heints, Chas. T.
ley and George Reine. Mem
lbers of the bar of St. Tammany and
sWashington parishes were honorary
pallbearers. Theanilghts of Colnam

participated in the funeral cere
monies.
There were innumerable offerings
S+of flowers the Bar Association send
l.t a beautiful white wreath and 4

Judge Lancaster was born ir .

'of age on April 10.' His father, 4

It was with deep sorrow that it
was learned that Judge Lancaster
had been stricken with death. The
fortitude with which he carried the
burden of hisc illness and the sad
misfortune of his wife, had won the
sympathy of all, yet while he answer
ed questions as to his health with
cheerful condldence, there ote are circum
stances that lead some to believe that
he had misgivings as to his ultimate
recovery. He attended every service
of the recent missionary meetings at
St. Peter's Chua, h, and he paid closat
attention to the remarks of Father
Moyer when he told how i at every

by Captain Young.
DR. MAYLIE MAKES
PRESENTATION TALK
I Feeling Reply by Captain
Young, With Assistance
of Mr. Neuhauser.
To the accompaniment of boom
ing cannon, shriking whistles and
patriotic music le Wednesday after
noon, from the main flg-pole of the
boat, the beautiful hBuse flag pro
sented to the Steamer Mandeville by
citizens of Mandeville slowly unfold
ed itself until firmly caught in the
embraces of the welcoming lake
breezes it straightened out and wav
ed as if answering the noisy saluta
tions showered upon it.
As the Steamer Mandeville made
fast to the wharf on her return trip
to New Orleans at 4:45 -p. m., an
immense delegation of Aiandevillians
headed byTown Marshal Smith and
the committee boarded #he boat, cap
tured Capt. Young and his gallant
crew, marched them to the quarter
deck and then Dr. A. 0. Maylle, a
spokesman for the delegation, pre
sented the flag throuah. Capt. Young
to the boat with a few appropriate
remarks and expressions of senti
ment and appreciation of naming the
boat after our cozy little town on
the lake. The Captain received the
flag and in an attempt to reply be
gan by saying: "My friends-'"
then he bogged and could navigate
no further. His heart seemed to fill
his bosom, his eyes glistened and the
tears slowly trickled down his face
and looking at Mr .M. R. Neuhauser
appealed for assistance, whereupon
"Mack," in true Blackstonian style,
uncorked a stream of flowery lan
guage eminently befitting the occa
sion and pledging the Captain' and
his men to tenderly care and, if re
quired, fight for that flag.
Then the skipper woke up. chang
ing his quid and giving his breeches
an extra hitch, he invited everybody
to be his guests for a ride to New Or
leans, then selecting one of the gen
tler sex, and there were many, he led
off in a horn-pipe, after which the
sterner sex answering an S. o. S:
sign, followed the Captain to the
restaurant to eat-not much. Suf
fice it : ? t that thl, no'.es emanat
ing from that quarter were correct
tho miniature imitation of those pro
duced by the cannon but a moment
before. What with music, dancing,
refreshments and the crew from the
master to the porter working over
time as hosts, in which capacity they
proved themselves adepts, 'tis need
less to state that the trip was most
enjoyable.
Landing at Mandeville- at 9 p. m.
the crowd gathered on the wharf
and with cannon and huzzahs bid
godspeed to- the boat, the crew and
the flag.
The ensign is 20 feet long, 8 feet
wide at the pole, tapering to 4 feet,
and of swallow-tail cut. The center
is white with the name"Mandeville"
in two-foot blue l~etters, the border
is blue, and at the pole end are two
two-foot red stars, thus presenting
the national colors.
The pier head was profusely dee
orated with tri-color bunting, Am
erican flags, palmetto and pines.
The committee in charge of the
arrangements ~gere Messrs. A. Hart
man, chairman; Jasper Lemieux, C.
B. Wills, James Berber and Dr. A. G.

of this Association that we request
the Governor to retain the said Dr.

BOTTOM FOR BODY
. Windmiller From St. Louis,
Resided in Abita Springs
Past Eight Months.
The Abita River is ordinarily a
placid, quiet stream, whose depth is
hidden by the shadow of overhanging
trees, and treacherous holes give no
indication of their presence.. The
boys who are familiar with the bath
ing holes know where these hollows
are and run little risk of stepping
into them, but strangers who bathe
alone run a risk, and there have been
several drowned in assuming this
risk unguided.
The body of David. Windmiller, of
St. Louis, but for the past eight or
nine months a resident of Abita
Springs, was found in the Abita
River Wednesday, about 3:15 p. m.
Windmiller had left home ,shortly
after dinner. He was 25 years o
age. Chas. Hamilton, his brother
ia-law, was notified and came for the
body.
The body was- recovered by Johr.
Peters, who dove into the water and
brought it to the surface. He was
brought to the scene by Russell Ca
lPtgne and Louis Grelle, who were
on their way to a bathing place, when
they discovered Windmiller's clothes.
They thought he might be hiding
from them, but their search for him
disclosed the body at the bottom of
the shallow river.
urday night. was a success in every
way. The program, which was as
varied as it was lengthy, was excel
lently carried out. The receipts
were more than satisfacto y, and the
Church of Our Lady of the Lake. the
beneficiary, is now out of debt. "The
Rev. Father Otillio, O. S. B., desires
to express his grateful thanks to all
those who in any way contributed
to the success of the entertainment.
"The Hip" opens tonight in all its
splendor, with music, fireworks, a
five-reel picture, several vaudeville
turns and - dancing. Today Lew
Rose, with his band, toured the prin
cipal towns of the-parish announcing
the above program.
This community was shocked when
on Tuesday evening it learned of the
sadden and untimely death of Judge
Jos. B. Lancaster. Mandevililans
mourn to a man and extend their
hartfelt sympathy to the aereaved
family whose lamentable loss is also
theirs. Many beautiful floral, offer

Ing and quite a number of town of
cials and other citizens attended
the funeral in attestation of their es

witnessed a good game of baseball
,and had the pleasure of seeing the
home team win over the fast Colum
bla nine of New Orleans this after
noon, in a slow and practidally fea
tureless contest, 3 to 2. Yogel's
pitching alone stood out to make the
game out of the ordinary. He struck
out eleven of the opposing batsmen,
yielded but four hits, two of which
came in the last inning, and allowed
but two rans.
Tht Columbia players continually 1
protested against the decisions of l
Umpire Henley claiming that he gave .1
the Slidell bunch the better of all I
the close plays, on which accounat
they were at a disadvantage. The
climax of adverses came in the eighth I
inn, when the ampire ordered "Bud"
Reza out of the gamb, thereby
weakenting the Columbias at the hat 1
iM that inning Rezas would have had i
an opportunity to tie? the score,' at 4
least, but Delcorploe was sent in after
his forced retirement' and could not l
