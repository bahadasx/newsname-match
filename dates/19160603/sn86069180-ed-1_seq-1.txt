Information has been received
from a man who has just arrived In
this country and who actually par
ticipated in the fighting in Dublin
that Major John McBride and
.Thomas McDonagh, who were ex
ecuted by tho British military
authorities, had been the victims of
official bad faith. He says that
..jMcBrideajd McDowgh.who, were
Mnwconimand'"oftbdrebels''lri'"lJacob,s
biscuit factory during tho Dublin
revolt, were visited by priests from
Aungler street, who urged them to
surrender and told them that if they
did so their lives would be spared.
"Send a military officer to us who
has authority to make that offer and
Ave will consider it," the -rebel lead
ers are reported to have said. Tho
priests left and in a short time a
military officer drove up In an
armored automobile and gave an
assurance that the rebels' lives
would be spared if they sur
rendered. McBride and McDonagh
agreed to the terms and the sur
render was arranged. Both were
subsequently court-martialed and
shot. Part of tho story Is corrobor
ated by at least one Dublin news
paper, tho Independent, which says:
"Tho Aungler street priests, it
should be remembered, made great
efforts to bring about peaco, and
during their numerous visits to
Jacob's factory urged on tho men
entrenched thero tho utter useless
ness of holding out, as the military
authorities had threatened to shell
the building at a certain hour on
Sunday last. However, before tho
hour mentioned some priests entered
the place, and It Is supposed that as
a result of their persuasion tho men
finally surrendered."

SINGS FIRST HIGH MASS.
The Sacred Heart church, Seven
teenth and Bi cartway, where nu
merous brilliant religious celebra
tions have been witnessed,-was. last
Sunday the scene of a young
priestts first high mass, that for
beauty and impresslveness was un
surpassed upon any similar occasion
in this city or diocese. The young
man who had given up tho world
to labor In the Lord's vineyard was
Rev. James J. Maloney, son of Mr.
and Mrs. Garrett Maloney, West
Broadway, and a boy of tho Sacred
Heart parish. Long before the thour
for the mass to begin the church
was filled with relatives, friends
and members of the congregation
eager to receive Father Maloney's
blessing. As tho cross-bearer ap
peared at the church entrance the
organ pealed forth and little boys
.in white, wreath-crowned girls,
sanctuary boys, priests and the
celebrant and his. assistants moved
in stately procession to the sanc
tuary, which was illuminated with
myriad lights and decked with
beautiful plants and flowers. Father
Maloney was assisted by Fathers
Joseph McAleer, Albert Wlcko and
John Fallon, and sang his mass in
a clear and strong voice that rovor
brated throughout tho sacred edi
fice. After the gospel tho Rev. Pat
rick Walsh, the pastor, ascended
the pulpit and preached a most
forceful and eloquent sermon on the
priesthood and fully explained the
ordination ceremony. They were
present, he said, to thank God for
the great dignity and grace the
priesthood conferred and to con
gratulate and pray with tho parents
who had given a son to tho altar.
Father Walsh declared he would
give all the world could offer for
the privilege of efferlng one mass.
The' priest has been tho heart and
soul of civilization, and nothing can
compare with God'a church, which
upholds tho secular power. In con
clusion he urged his hearers to
unite with the young priest in
thanksgiving to God for all his
gifts. After the mass the clergy,
ot whom thero were many, were

a great statesman or genius he is
surely blessed with good fortune,
as to date ho has gotten all of tho
best of breaks in politics.
With both of the leading parties
polling their natural strength this
year and normal conditions prevail
ing, the Republican nominee would
defeat Wilson In nearly every State
In the Union, with the exception of
tho rock-ribbed Southorn Demo
cratic States. Wilson Is not strong
with the people because of his weak
Mexican policy and his evident In
tent, backed by his Cabinet, to givo
England tho best of It in every con
troversy arising over the war. Again
prosperity has not been so rampant
as somo would havo us believe, tho
good times and high wages being
confined to tho districts where war
munitions aro being furnished. With
all of this against his chance tho
Goddess of Fortune and Luck has
begun to smllo on him and tho
Democratic party, by stirring up un
heard of strife in the Republican
party, and before adjournment of
the G. O. P. convention thero will
be more bitterness between tho
Roosevelt and antl-Roosovelt men
than there was in 1912, and that's
saying a great deal.
To begin with, tho Rough Rider
Is making a whirlwind finish in his
campaign for tho Republican nom
ination, leaving no stone unturned
to accomplish his purpose. All of
the side-show tricks In his category
are being used and magnified, the
latest being the knife throwing in
cident at Kansas City. Press agents
galore aro on tho job, magnifying
the demonstrations in his honor, his
personal organs telling daily In pat-ent-mediclno
fashion how tho people
are crying for him to lead them
out of the wilderness. All of thru
is dono to frighten tho Hughes
backers and the men in control of
the convention who do not want
Hughes. Bluff and bluster will bo
the watchword of tho Roosevelt fol
lowers at Chicago and if tho Repub
lican leaders do not accede ,to his
high-handed demands, but Instead
nominate Hughes, then the old
adago of "Hell hath no fury like a
woman scorned" will havo to be
altered, as that comparison will bo
too mild -in comparing the attitude
ot Roosevelt in case he Is thrown
down by tho Republican conven
tion. It is hardly necessary to. add
that he will never rest day or night
until he accomplishes tho defeat of
tho man who wrests the nomination
from him. All ot this makes tho
averago Democrat smile, but somo
doubtful ones say "What will hap
pen in the event that Roosevelt
captures tho nomination?"
Tho get-together Republicans had
hoped that the German and German-American
vote would bo found
supporting the Republican nominee,
but the following, taken from
Roosevelt's speech at St. Louis
Wednesday, alionates that voto In
the event he is nominated: "I do
nounco the German-American Alli
ance with all my soul; the acts of
Its leaders constlttue moral treason
to our Government and its people."
Incidentally in connection with this
It must be remembered that 80 per
cent, of the German and German
American vote in this country Is
allied with tho Republican party.
Now. for another view. The Irish
World, a leading publication of its
kind a'ad a staunch supporter of
Roosevelt in 1912, now says that it'

tho fact that tho Now Yor Tribune,
the most rabid pro-British feaper in
America and a former bitter isnemy
of Teddy, now rallies to his BilP
port becauso ho promises to nluntfe
this country Into war If elected, just
to help England and her allies. All
of this convinces tho average politi
cal student that ,if not a great
leader, Wilson is surely a creature
of good fortune. Roosevelt's win
or defeat will bo In his favor.
Local conditions aro but typical
of these throughout tho country. A
mass meeting has been arranged by
tno Louisville Roosovelt men to
coerce the delegates Into supporting
him in tho convention. Tho dele
gates refuso to be bluffed and say
they are against him at any stage

"Benediction of the Blessed Sacra
ment" conveys no meaning, or at
best a very hazy and imperfect one.
For the information of such wo give
a description of the ceremony and
Its significance, written by no less
an authority than Cardinal New
man, as follows:
"I need hardly observe to you,
my brothers, that tho Benediction
of the Blessed Sacrament is ono of
tho simplest rites of tho church.
Tho priests enter and kneel down,
ono of them unlocks the tabernacle,
takes out tho Blessed Sacrament,
inserts it upright in a monstrance
of precious metal and sets it in a
conspicuous placo abovo tho altar
In tho midst of lights for all to see.
Tho people then begin to sing;
meanwhile tho priest twlco offers
incense to tho King of Heaven, bo-
fore whom ho Is kneeling. Then
he takes tho monstrarico in his
hands and turning to tho people
blesses them with tho Most Holy
In the form of a cross, whilo tho
bell Is sounded to call attention to
tho ceremony. It is our Lord's
solemn benediction of his people
as when Ho lifted up his hands over
the children, or when He blessed
his chosen ones when Ho ascended
from Mount Olivet."
As sons might como before a
parent before going to bed at night,
so once or twice a week tho great
Catholic family comes before tho
Eternal Father, after tho bustle and
toll of tho day, and Ho smiles upon
them and sheds upon them the light
of his countenance. It is a full ac
complishment of what the priest
Invoked upon the Israelites, "The
Lord bless thee and keep thee, tho
Lord show his face to the and
have mercy on thee, the Lord turn
his countenance to theo and give
thee peace." Can there be a moro
touching. rite, even In tho judgment
of those who do not believe It? How
many a man, not a Catholic, is
moved on seeing It to say, "O, that
I did but believe It!" when he seeB
the Driest tako tho Fount of Mercy
and the people bend low In adora
tion. It Is ono of tho most beauti
ful, natural and soothing actions of
tho church. ,
June 19 will be tho beautiful
feast of tho Sacred Heart of Jesus,
a day of special devotion among
Catholics all over tho world, in al
most every ago wo find devotion to
tho Sacred Heart practiced by somo
at least of tho children of the
Catholic church. Tho great doctors,
St. Ambrose and St. Augustln, point
to CalVary as Its birthplace, for
there from his wounded side our
Lord revealed his heart to men. St.
Gregory tho Great, later on, com
pares tho faithful soul hidden
therein to the dove In the cleft of
the rock. St. Peter Damlan in tho
eleventh century, St. Anselm and" St.
Bernard In the twelfth century were
all apostles of the devotion. St.
Lutgarfle, a nun of tho" thirteenth
century, won for herself tho title
of Lutgarde of tho Sacred Heart.
Blessed Ida of Louvaln, another
nun in the following century, as
well as St, Frances of Rome, St,
Margaret of Cortona, Blessed An
gela of Foligno, tho great Benedic
tine Abbots Clsneros and BIoslus,
and St. Francis de Sales, are all dis
tinguished by their deep love of tho
Sacred Heart.
But it was St. Gertrude and St
Mechtilde, in the seclusion of their
Benedictine home in the thirteenth
rJ;
century, who received tho revela
tions of Our Lord upon this sub
jct more fully and more clearly
than any saint before or since. To
these chosen ones Ho entrusted the
secrets of his love. That a great
devotion to tho Sacred Heart existed
In English countries before tho
Reformation is shown by the many
representations of it still to, bo seen
In painting and sculpture in the Ab
beys of Westminster, Bath, Whitby
and elsewhere.
In choosing the liturgy for this
I feast tho church has kept to the
gioriiicatlon or our Redeemer's love,
of which tho Sacred Heart is a sym
bol. Tho Introit speaks of God's
mercy: "For He hath not will
ingly afflicted nor cast off the chil
dren ot men; the Lord is good to
them that hope in Him," etc. The
Collect asks for grace to appreciate
tho benefits brought to us by the
Sacred Heart. The lesson from
Isaias celebrates again the mercy of
God to man. "Ye shall drain waters
with joy," It says, from the Sav
iour's fountains, Tho Gradual re
fers to our Lord's sufferings for
us, "O, all yo that pass by tho way,
attend to see if thero be any sor
rpw unto my sorrows," and then
passes to St. John's testimony of
Him, "Having loved his own, who
wero In tho world, Ho loved them
unto tho end." Tho Alleluia verso
calls upon us to learn of Him who
was meek and humble of heart It wo
would find rest. The Gospel re
counts the piercing of the Sacred
Heart. The Offertory again ascribes
praise to God, "Bless tho Lord, O
my soul, and never forget all that
Ho hath dono for thee; who satls
fieth thy desire with good things.
Alleulia."

THE DRIVING POWER FOR GOOD
A few weeks from now Is school-
closing time. The parochial schools
of tho country, along- with tho other
educational Institutions, will com
plete their courses for the present
year. Tho great benefit of these
places of religious as well as secular
education is not recognized as it
should be. Much is said in pralso
of the public school systems of our
Commonwealths. Their modern
buildings, their social activities, ever
widening as they are, their cur.
rlcula, aro lauded to tho skies. Gov
ernment bureaus not alono commend
them but use them, without any
justification, as tho exclusive agen
cies for their educational work. Tho
Importance of religious training for
tho welfare of tho community Is
unfortunately neglected or Ignored.
A man who has lived through all
tho experiences of a thrilling and
adventurous life has written some
thing on this subject which it would
bo well for the champions of our
"modern educational Ideas" to take
to heart. It shows vividly and
strongly the beneficial Influence of
religious training. Sir Henry Mor
ton Stanley, tho great explorer of
tno Dark Continent, who headed tho
expedition in search of Livingstone,
in more than one place in his "Auto
biography" testified to this fact. In
the 'very first chapter, in writing ot
his early life in the workhouse of
St. Asaph, ho tells us of this.

"That same Inward monitor," ho
says a little later on, "bos re

creatures with false promises, and
from hastily condemning them with
out sufficient evidence, from listen
