E sixteenth national convention
of the Republican party, which
in the Coliseum in Chica
go on June 7, will be one of the
.most interesting and exciting gather
ings ever held by that party. Excite
ment will be intensified because of the
uncertainty of the nominee. When the
first ballot is taken there will be a
dozen men voted for, any one of whom
may subsequently be the fortunate one.
It is conceded that all of these have a
chance, some better than others.
Another thing that tends to add In
terest is the attitude of the Progressive
party. The split of 1912 is vividly re
called. Will the two factions get to
gether this year, or will there again be
a third ticket?
The history of this split is well
known. Theodore Roosevelt, who had
served one term of his own and three
and a half years of McKinley's second
term after the latter's assassination,
unqualifiedly indorsed William H.
Taft, then secretary of state, for presi
dent in 1908. Mr. Taft was overwhelm
ingly elected.
Break Four Years Ago.
The convention of 1912 approached.
Roosevelt was then an avowed candi
date. While he had not served two
complete terms, the third term argu
ment against naming him was raised.
A bitter fight over seating the contest
ed delegations was raised. Finally a
majority of delegates with Taft pro
clivities were seated and the voting
started. On the firs*- ballot Taft re
ceived 561 votes and Roosevelt 107. A
few others were scattered between
Hughes of New York, La Follette of
Wisconsin and Cummins of Iowa.
However, there were 344 delegates
who, vexed at the manner the contests
had been settled, refused to vote for
any candidate.
Colonel Roosevelt then organized the
Progressive party, was declared the
nominee for president and in the elec
tion the following November received
a larger popular vote than did Taft,
the nominee of the regular Republican
party. The vote then was as follows:
Woodrow Wilson, Democrat, 6,293,019
Theodore Roosevelt, Progressive, 4,119,-
507 William H. Taft, Republican,
3,484,956. Wilson received 435 votes
In the electoral college, Roosevelt 88
and Taft only 8.
This was the birth of the Progressive
party, which may be amalgamated with
the Republicans again at the approach
ing Chicago convention or which may
continue to exist and again name a
third candidate. It will hold a con
vention In Chicago, also opening on
June 7.
The Republican convention of 1860
was one of the most exciting and sur
prising ever held. Long before the
convention met it was seen that the
contest very likely lay between Lin
coln and Seward. All the free and
border states, with the addition of
Texas, were represented. The first
two days were taken up with seating
the delegates and adopting a platform
on the third the candidates were for
mally presented without speeches.
Seward was popular, and his cause was
superbly managed by Thurlow Weed,
one of the shrewdest politicians the
country has produced. But there was
a growing feeling that, much as he de
served of the party, Seward could not
carry such doubtful states as Pennsyl
vania and Indiana. On the morning
of the third day Weed, in attempting
a Seward demonstration, was outwit
ted. He planned a monster parade in
Seward's behalf. While his adherents
were parading the streets the Lincoln
managers packed the enormous Wig
wam, where the convention was held,
with their sympathizers. It was a
bold stroke, and it gave the Lincoln
cause the powerful aid that an enthu
siastic audience alone can give. As
the balloting proceeded every vote for
Lincoln was cheered to the. echo.

The Republican Hational
Seward led on the first two ballots,
but on the second his gain was but 10,
while Lincoln, largely through Penn
sylvania's support, gained 75. While
the third ballot was being counted a
hush fell on the convention. It was
known that Lincoln was either nom
inated or very close to It. The count
showed him to be but two and a half
votes short of a majority, with 231%
votes, 180 for Seward and 50 scatter
ing.
At this juncture Chairman Carter of
the Ohio delegation mounted a chair
and called out, "I rise to announce the
change of four votes from Ohio from
Mr. Chase to Abraham Lincoln." As
soon as it was realized that this gave
Lincoln the nomination an uproar
broke forth. An immense charcoal
likeness of Lincoln was unrolled from
the rear gallery, and the entire audi
ence and convention, with the excep
tion of the New York delegation, in
dulged in the wildest enthusiasm for
some minutes. When* order was tfc
stored there were other changes that
gave Lincoln a total of 354.
Ingersoll on Blaine.
When the Republican convention con
vened at Cincinnati In 1876 Blaine was
thought to have a safe majority of the
delegates surely for him. As a matter
of fact, he did receive the votes of a
majority of the delegates, but not on
any one ballot. Many delegates were
held by instructions or other complica
tions from registering their real wishes,
and there was probably not a mo
ment when, had they all been free to
act as they chose, he could not have
received a large majority.
The speech of Robert G. Ingersoll
placing Blaine in nomination will go
down in history as a most eloquent ex
ample of convention/oratory. When
the speakerfinishedthe stirring tribute
to the "plumed knight" even the oppo
nents of the Maine statesman were
stirred to enthusiasm In spite of them
selves. The audience and delegates
rose as one man, those who bore in
structions for other candidates vielng
with Blaine's most steadfast support
ers In paying him the compliment of
unrestrained applause. If a ballot had
been reached that day It is doubtful if
any power could have prevented
Blaine's nomination. It was at this
critical juncture that some of the cool
er headed of the antl-Blalne leaders re
sorted to extreme tactics to save the
day. They had the gas clandestinely
cut off from the convention hall, so
that when night came on adjournment
was forced by the darkness.
Overnight the opposing forces re
gained their equilibrium and struggled
desperately for delay. The key to the
situation was held by the Pennsylva
nia delegation, which, under the head
of Simon Cameron, one of Blaine's bit
terest opponents, was instructed to
vote for Governor Hartranft. At the
end of the second day of balloting
Cameron realized that he could not
hold the delegates In line much longer.
He therefore proposed that the delega
tion should continue to support Hart
ranft only so long as his vote increased.
When it fell off they were to be free to
vote as they chose. The Blaine mem
bers of the delegation eagerly accepted
this apparently favorable proposal.
Cameron, however, who knew argu
ments that would go with the southern
carpet bag and negro politicians, ar
ranged to have Hartranft's vote in
crease slightly on each ballot. By this
method Hartranft's vote was main
tained until the break to Hayes as a
compromise candidate came on the
seventh ballot.
Grant and Third Term.
When the Republican national con
vention met at Chicago on June 2,
1880, more than three-quarters of the
delegates were found to be almost
equally divided into two political
camps. The two leaders whom they
supported were General Grant, who
?^^^^^^^^^"Wf^i^
THE
was a candidate for a third term, and
James G. Blaine, who had been a lead
ing candidate In 1876. The two forces
were completely organized and ably
led, Roscoe Conkling being In charge
I of the Grant forces, while Senator
Hale marshaled the Blaine cohort*
Grant's opponents were fully realiz
lng that In view of the remarkable
manifestation of popularity which had
been accorded him since his return In
the previous fall from a tour of the
world, their best ground of attack was
the opposition, to a third term. All at
tempts to get him to commit himself
early in 1880 had been answered by
jthe terse declaration, "I will neither
accept nor decline an Imaginary thing."
His supporters took heart, however,
and when the convention met it was
evident that his followers were confi
dent of winning.
Conkling adopted a truculent and ar
rogant attitude in the convention pro
ceedings from the very start that stung
the Blaine leaders to anger and de
stroyed all possibility of compromise.
His first act in the convention was a
play to the galleries and at the same
time a studied Insult of the Blaine fac
tion. He moved a resolution binding
the delegates to support the nominee of
the convention, whoever he might be,
thus showing a pretended distrust of
the Blaine following. The resolution
was adopted, but the debate upon it
made him so unpopular with the sup
porters of all the other candidates that
it really made the. hope of obtaining re
cruits for Grant in other directions im
possible.
Garfield Picked Out.
Conkling's next move was to attempt
to force the unit rule on the convention
by which he would have been able to
cast New York's entire vote for Grant.
As it then stood the delegation was di
vided 51 for Grant, 17 for Blaine and 2
for Sherman. James A. Garfield, chair
man of the committee on rules, report
ed adversely on this proposal and de
fended his position so ably and elo
quently as not only to defeat Conk
ling's move, but to make Garfield him
self a marked man, to whom the con
vention could enthusiastically and
gratefully turn when tired out with the
hopeless struggle. Garfield's closing
words in defining his position in oppo
sition to the unit rule, that he stood his
ground because he believed it "to be
everlastingly right," not only carried
the convention with him in the ensuing
vote, but recurred to them with new
force when his name came before them
as a candidate later on.
Conkling's nominating speech was a
masterly example of convention ora
tory, ranking almost on a plane with
Ingersoll's speech of four years earlier.
Its opening phrase, "When asked
whence comes our candidate, our sole
responfe will be, he hails from Appo
mattox and its' famous apple tree,"
caught the fancy of the galleries and
aroused enthusiasm, but it was very
near doggerel. At one of the evening
sessions a demonstration in Grant's
behalf was started that precipitated a
full half hour of ear breaking enthusi
asm, during which the audience broke
Into song, bands played, and Conkling,
standing on a chair In the center of the
New York delegation, slowly waved
the state banner back and forth.
Scarcely had this tumult died" down
when a handsomely dressed woman
leaped to the pedestal of a statue of
Liberty on the platform and waved a
red parasol wildly. Then she caught up
the flag and, winding it about her,
called for cheers for Blaine. They
were given with a spirit and vim that
matched that for Grant a few minutes
earlier. When the watches recorded
the fact that the Blaine demonstration
had lasted five minutes longer than
that for Grant it subsided suddenly.
Grant led on the first ballot with 304
votes to 284 for Blaine, 93 for Sher
man, 81 for Washburne and 30 for Ed
munds.. After, thirty-five ballots had

been taken with little or no change the
convention became weary. When,
therefore, the Wisconsin delegation
after a caucus decided by a few votes
to throw their support to Garfield it
was a signal for the stampede which
made Garfield the nominee and ended
the most dramatic convention struggle
In American history.
Harrison's Shouters.
"I am a Republican. I belong to the
grandest political body ever organized
by the human race"
This was as far as he was allowed to
proceed In the last speech Colonel Rob
ert Ingersoll ever made in a national
convention. The Republicans had gath
ered in Chicago In 1888 either to nom
inate James G. Blaine or Benjamin
Harrison. Blaine was coaching in
Scotland with Andrew Carnegie. The
convention decided to offer him the
nomination by cable and take a recess
until a reply was received. This was
about noon. There were fully 12,000
people In the big auditorium, and they
made It plain that they wanted to hear
from some of the leading Republican
orators. It was decided to gratify their
wishes. Frederick Douglass,,the negro
orator, was the first speaker,.'and what
he said was highly pleasing to the
crowd. He spoke for nearly thirty
minutes. i
While he was speaking the Harrison
managers observed Colonel' Ingersoll
seated on the platform. He was there
In the interests of Walter Q. Gresham
of Indiana, Harrison's most formidable
opponent. Only the preceding day
there had been a very Impressive "full
dinner pail" parade for Gresham by
Chicago workingmen. Here was a di
lemma. Every man in the convention
hall knew of Ingersoll's skill as an ora
tor. Probably every one of them had
read his famous "plumed, knight"
speech In which he placed Blaine In
nomination at Cincinnati In 1876. To
permit him to speak now, even though
he should mention Greshaih's name
only Incidentally, would be fo imperil
Harrison's chances. The Harrison
leaders held a hurried consultation and
dispatched runners to all pans of the
building with Instructions to! stop In
gersoll at all hazards. 1
When Douglass concluded there were
cries of "Ingersoll!" "Ingersbll!" De
liberately the colonel took hl| place in
front of the rostrum. He ws$ given a
wildly enthusiastic gre*ftngr%htte the
cheering was In progress he stood calm
ly wiping his big bald head awaiting
the restoration of order. The crowd
seemed to feel that something unusual
was about to happen. It was an anx
ious moment'for the Harrison cohorts.
Ingersoll surveyed his great audience
Blowly and then In a strong, rich voice,
each word carefully measured, spoke
the two sentences quoted above.
The effect was electric. Seventeen
words had literally swept the audience
off its feet Every man and. every wo
man stood up and cheered. There were
three minutes perhaps of genuine ap
plause. Then when it began to subside
the Harrison claquers would renew the
cheering. These tactics were continued
for five minutes. Ingersoll attempted
to resume his speech. Immediately his
voice was drowned by the noise, which
proceeded mainly from the floor of the
convention hall. Each time the colo
nel tried to speak the uproar was re
newed. At last, after at least half a
dozen fruitless attempts to proceed, he
retired In disgust.
A motion to adjourn until 4 o'clock in
the afternoon was declared carried by
the chairman. When the convention
reconvened a cablegram from Blaine
declining the nomination was read, and
Harrison was named.
New Method of Making Bread.
A new method of making bread has
been adopted in Italy. It Is found that
660 pounds of grain produce 880
pounds of what is termed "natural
bread." In the process the grain is
sifted and washed. It is then left for
from forty-eight to sixty hours in a
warm bath, where it germinates and
begins to sprout. When the germinat
ing process has gone far enough the
grain is crushed In a machine and
made Into dough, which is passed into
the oven.
Eleven Cents Grew to $3.78.
In 1864 Charles J. Davis, then living
in Baltimore, had an account with a
savings bank, but, intending to move
to Cecil county, drew most of his
money, leaving a balance of 11 cents.
He thought no more about it until a
few days ago, when he found the bank
book. Out of curiosity he wrote to the
bank and received a check for $3.78.
The Price ofLiberty
[Elihu Root in Leslie's.]
We have enjoyed liberty and order
so long that we have forgotten how
they came. Our people assume that
they came as the air comes. They
have assumed that they will of their
nature and by their own force con
tinue forever without effort. Ah, no!
Liberty has always been born of
struggle. It has not come save
through sacrifice and the blood of
martyrs and the devotion of mankind.
And it is not to be preserved except
by jealous watchfulness and stern .de-
termination always to be free. That
eternal vigilance is the price of
liberty is so much a truism that it has
lost its meaning, but it is an eternal
truth.

HON. CHARLES D. HILLES,
Chairman of the Republican National Committee, One of the Mighty Men of
the G. O. P. Now in Chicago Ready for Meeting
of Committee June 1.
Louisiana white and colored Repub
licans will send contesting delega
tions to Chicago conventions. The
lily-whites met and elected twelve
delegates. The colored men appeared
at the Gruenewald Hotel and de
manded admission, but were refused
by the hoter management saying that
colored men could not participate in
conventions in that hostelry. The
colored men charge that this was the
ruse by which the lily-whites barred
them. They, will send a full delega
tion.
Colored men were eliminated as
voting factors in the Texas Republi
can convention at Fort Worth, Tex.,
Monday.
Contests over seating of delegates,
in which the race question was pre
dominant, occupied the convention
throughout the day and made a night
session necessary for the election of
delegates to the national convention.
Contests over^the six delegates at
large from Alabama and one from
the ninth congressional district of the
same state were filed with Secretary
Reynolds, of the Republican national
committee, today. This brings the
total number of contested delegates
up to 54. The national committee
will begin hearing the contests June
1st.
The stock fight over "restriction
of the South" is being staged for the
Republican national convention. The
Southern States, led by Texas, are
reported to be preparing for a battle
to have their voting strength restored
to the basis in vogue in 1912.
Some of the western states are
making ready for an. effort to have
the delegate strength of the south
pruned down still further.
By a rule of the Republican na
tional committee adopted since the
convention of 1912, the southern
states have lost a total of 91 votes.
For district delegates they are al
lowed one delegate for each congres
sional district and two delegates for
each district that polls at least 7,500
Republican votes.
On this basis the convention June
7 will have 985 votes. In 1912 the
convention voting strength was 1,079.
Thus there has been a decrease of
94 votes, three of which were lost

biggest ball ever given in the United
States." It is proposed to hold it in
the ballrooms of the downtown halls.
John C. Eversman, secretary of the
Republican national congressional
committee, has opened headquarters
at the Congress.
Headquarters for residential can
didates for the Republican National
Convention have been opened at the
Congress Hotel, according to an an
nouncement by the management, as
follows:
John W. Weeks of Massachusetts,
in the Presidential suite, room 1,102,
parlor floor.
Theodore E. Burton, Ohio, Eliza
bethan room, south end of Peacock
alley.
Elihu Root, the palm garden, par
lor floor, and J-22-24-26-28.
Charles Warren Fairbanks, Indi
ana, English room, near the gold ball
room, and rooms A-6 and 8, adjoin
ing.
Senator Lawrence Y. Sherman's
headquarters in the gold ball room
and the Illinois state delegation in
the green room, will be opened Mon
day morning. The headquarters of
Senator Cummins of Iowa, in the oak
room, mezzanine floor, will be opened
the first of next week.
Arrangements for the republican na
tional convention are all being di
rected toward preparation for a pro
convention will open on Wednesday,
longed deadlock that may carry the
sessions through the week-end. The
June 7, and every step in the prepara
tions was taken with a view to a long
grind of roll calls.
The lease, on the Coliseum holds
the building for convention purposes
"until the convention adjourns," and
the preparedness for a long session
isHieing made so complete that even
the seats to be occupied by the dele
gates are being upholstered to make
the tedium of a deadlock more easy to
endure.
Senator Boies Penrose's victory in
the Pennsylvania primary, although
unofficial returns indicate that he may
not have a solid delegation behind
him, strengthened materially the hand
of the old guard and assures them
control of the republican national con
vention.
Some see in the Penrose victory at
the same time a strong possibility that
Philander C. Knox, former secretary
of state, attorney general and United
States senator, will have to be reck
oned with in the selection of a re
publican candidate for president.
