On -;TbUTsday evening.; May 25th,
the Senior Class of the High ; School
held its graduation exercises- at the
High j School A liditnrium: -od ; were
presented with diploma t'Professor
J. H .. Jf iesley" which neerUned that
they had completed" .witA-wn0r .the
course"1 study prescribe byo"thH
Board of Education. There were six
teen in the class and a large n winner
of them were our boys and .girls from
the country who bse attended High
School from different localities It
was a gratifying, moment for' their
parents; their teachers and friends.
Each class that graduates annually
from High School have many mem
ories to carry with them of struggle
a:ii disappointment of times, " and
many pleasures and this class is
no exception to the rule and . all ad
mire the young man or woman who
puts up a good fight and surmounts
the difficulties and stays with the
task as the members of this class did.
Wa-Keeney can .only feel proud of
her excellent schools and their pro
ducts'. J. H. Eiiie- of : Abilene gave
the address of , the evening "Lifes
Trinities." Mr. Engle "gave an ex
cellent address. Many speakers on
occasions of this kind very often miss
an opportunity to sfive some good
safe, sane and practical advise, but
this is not true of- Mr. Engle. His
discourse abounded with some of the
best thoughts that have been
put before a class for a long time.
One of his strong remarks was "no
person is educated until lie knows
himself, until he knows the world
and until he knows God." Mr. Engle
was an inspiration to the class and
his address v. ill long be remembered
by all who heard him. The class
motto in red and white, the class
colors, was ''Not'at the top butclimb-
ing" arid worked in splendidly with
the : speakers remarks. .The ..High
School chorus and the Alumni quar
tette and the quartette composed of
Misses Braddy and Ywe" and
Messrs. Reason and Niesley furnished
the music for the evening and all
the selections were beautifuHy ren
dered. At the close of the exercises
the .tenthannual alumni banquet
was givenJUvthe'-EIifflr" School - Gym-
nasium, ' wh're neafty one" hundred:
members partook of ;a -three 'ooirse
supper served by the Good Witt Soc
iety which brought the 'happy even
ing to a close!. - ' . - '
Decoration Day was observed with
appropriate exercises in which many
people participated. In the morning
the usual march to the cemetery by
the members of the G. A. K. and
others was' made to "decorate the
graves. Nearly ' ail of the business
houses and a number of private res
idences" were decorated with Sags
and bunting. . In the afternoon a
very large crowd gathered at the
C6urt House for the further exercises
of the day. Splendid music was fur
nished by . the band throughout the
day. The music by the quartette
was also excellent. Jake Heckman
read an appropriate Decoration Day
poem entitled '"Fifty Years After.."
Miss lone Kraus read the Gettysburg
address in her usual splendid man
ner. Cheif Justice Burch, of Salina,
was the speaker of the day and made
an excellent address. Everyone was
well pleased with what he said and
the way in which he said it. . He is
a scholarly and impressive speaker and
the town felt honored in having the
privilege of hearing him. His speach
was full of splendid live issues of the
day as well touching memories of the
soldiers who laid down their lives for
their country. We nope J adge Burch
will Tisit our city in the capacity of
a speaker at some future time.
