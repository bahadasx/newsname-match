Berlin, June 3. England's
claim to the mastery of the sea is
broken. This is the German
view resulting from the victory
of the fleet of Vice Admiral
Scheer. which has given the
kaiser's name as brilliant a tra
dition as is written on the pages
of any naval power.
Flags were displayed everywhere
today in celebration of the long ex
pected clash with the British high
seas fleet and the German success.
Schcols were dismissed, special serv
ices of celebration and thanksgiving
were called and German enthusiasm
was aroused as at no time since the
Kaiser's army was drawing near Paris
early in the war.
Step Towards Peace.
Although no official statement was
obtainable, it was evident that the sea
victory is regarded here as another
step toward a possible early peace.
Dvfeat of the British fleet the first
time it felt Germany's naval power;
the fact that German territory is ciear
of the enemy; that Belgium and
northern France are successfully held
while the French and British lines
have remained stationary for the past
year, and the crown prince is ham
mering at the gates of Verdun these
points were cited as answers to the
allied demands that Germany be
crushed.
To Decorate Victors.
The kaiser is expected to hurry di
rect to Wilheimshaven, where he- will
inspect the returning victorious fleet,
personally congratulate and decorate
Admiral Scherer and his men.

Loss Includes Two Battleships
and Two Cruisers.
o Banger Losing Superiority
of Sea, Say Britons.
London. June 3. The British public
who retired last night cast down by
the first news of the North sea battle,
as contained in the earlier British and
German reports, took some comfort
from the later British reports publish
ed in the morning papers.
This report, while it did not de
crease the British losses except in de
stroyers, which were reduced from 11
to 8, shows the losses of the Germans
were much greater than was at first
estimated.
According to this latest account of
the great naval engagement the Ger
man losses include two battleships,
one battle cruiser, one light cruiser
and six destroyers sunk; two battle
cruisers damaged and three battle
ships hit.
Naval writers also point out that the
German fleet retired as soon as the
main British fleet appeared on the
scene so that there is no question
about the superiority of sea power re
maining in British hands. The loss of
British ships is of course admitted as
serious while the loss in officers and
men has cast a gloom over the whoie
country.

Three Steamers Down Without Warn

3erlin. June 3. Swedish newspa
pers reported that three German
steamers have been torpedoed by a
submarine without warning, probably
in Swedish waters. Of the crews, six
men perished. Since the ships were
sunk, an English torpedo has been
found near Skeldervikin. The Swedish
press thinks it certain that the tor
pedoing was committed by an English
Twentieth Will Go to ew
Yorker, Is Belief.
THE FEELING AGAINST COLONEL
'ot Loye for Hughes That
Has Influenced Tote.
Dare Mulvane of Topeka Sits
on Lid at Chicago. .
Chicago, June 3. For the first time
since the Republican state convention,
inside dope as to the alignment of
Kansas delegates became known here
today. An authoritative poll of the
twenty delegates from Kansas will
probably give Hughes nine votes on
the first ballot. Six of the remaining
votes are regarded as certain for Root
with four for Weeks. The twentieth
delegate is uncertain as to Root or
Weeks, but is expected to support the
New Yorker on the first ballot.
Claims of Hughes supporters in
Kansas to the effect that they would
bo able to deliver two-thirds of the
Katisas delegation to Justice Hughes
on the first ballot were shattered in
the dope sheet which today became
the official document in the record
of uninstructed delegates. While Just
ice Hughes will lead the field in the
fight for control of the delegation, he
will fall one vote short of an even
break on the delegation and two votes
short of a majority. Except in event
of a swing to the supreme court just
ice after the early balloting, it is not
believed that Hughes will at any time
receive more than ten of the twenty
votes.
Drive 'Em to Hughes.
An alignment which would drive
the aKnsas delegates to Hughes is ex
pected to be perfected only in event
party leaders in the convention feel
that all anti-Roosevelt forces must
be centered early in the battle li. an
effort to block Roosevelt's nomina
tion. In that event all anti-Roosevelt
delegates would be herded together
in an effort to beat the colonel. The
standpat crowd which claims abso
lute control of the convention through
uninstructed delegates, assert their
willingness to accept Hughes in pref
erence to Roosevelt. It is not love for
Hughes. It is political feeling against
the colonel. They over-looked Gov
ernor Capper's action as progressive
and forgave him, but it's harder to
forget Roosevelt.
Spurn Compromise.
Leaders in the Progressive camp as
sert they will spurn all offers of a
compromise. It is the same spirit
which marked the Progressives state
convention in Topeka ten days ago.
The Mulvane party leaders merely
smile at any suggestion that Roosevelt
might at any stage of the fight receive
help from Kansas. The delegation is
stampede-proof, they assert. It may
divide as to Weeks or Root and refuse
to unite on Hughes. But Roosevelt,
Nay, Gertrude.
Nine for Hughes.
Nine men in the delegation from
Kansas who are expected to support
Hughes on the first ballot are: W. T.
Morgan, lieutenant governor, Hutch
inson; Charles Tucker, Lawrence;
John O. Morse, Mound City; J. J.
Rhodes, Council Grove; E. F. Fulton,
Marysville; Emmett George, Mankato;
I. E. Purcell, Wakeeney: L. J. Petty
john, Dodge City, and Ezra Branine,
Newton.
Six and probably seven votes are re
garded as certain for Root when the
delegates cast their first ballot late
next week. The Kansans regarded as
most certainly in the Root column are:
Al F. Williams, Columbus; S. F. Fitz
patrick. Independence; A. H. Denton,
Arkansas City; Fred Sturgis, Con
cordia; J. N. Tincher, Medicine Lodge,
and J. B. Adams, ElDorado. Charles
E. Moore of Eureka, is listed as un
certain as to Root or Weeks, but is
expected to vote for Root on the first
ballot. With Moore in the ranks. Root
would be insured seven votes- in the
delegation. Otherwise, Root would
check in with six delegates and Weeks
of Massachusetts would have five votes
to his credit.
Charles F. Scott. Iola: T. D. Smith
Hiawatha; W. D. Casey, Atchison; and
Ira K. Wells. Seneca, are placed in the
Weeks column under the dope sheet.
The Weeks delegates are expected to
go to Root if the former Massachusetts
senator is out of it after the early bat
loting.
Two for Weeks.
Two members of the Big Four-
Scott and Smith are in the Weeks
column, with Morgan for Hughes and
Williams for Weeks. Both members
of the First district delegation are for
Weeks, while delegates from the Sec
ond and Sixth districts are expected to
vote sonmy lor Hughes. Both dele
gates from the Third district are listed
for Root, while delegates from other
districts are divided.
D. W. Mulvane of Topeka, former
national committeeman for Kansas, is
sitting on the lid at the Congress hotel.
Mulvane is one of the really big men
in the councils of the old guard. He
served on the committee which four
years ago voted to unseat the Roose
velt delegates. In spite of the fight
w,hich was made on Mulvane in the
congressional district conventions last
spring, the Topeka man's strength
with the Kansas delegation is some
thing for leaders to conjure with.

Standpatters Are Willing to
Concede Vice President.
Chicago, June 3. Progressive party
leaders after conferring today de
clared their intention of using every
influence to induce the Republican
national convention to nominate
Roosevelt for president.
If they fail to make him the Repub
lican nominee, they say they are will
ing to consider the qualifications of
other candidates but they will decline
to discuss other names until it Is cer
tain that Roosevelt cannot win the
endorsement.
Numerous informal conferences be
tween Progressives and Republicans
have been held and others are sched
uled during the next few days. Re
publican organization leaders appar
ently are doing nothing to offend the
friends of Roosevelt In the prelim
inary maneuvers. They are willing,
it is said to let the Progressives dic
tate the party platform and name the
candidate for vice president, but they
are vigorously opposed to nominating
Roosevelt for president
They hope to select a man whom
Roosevelt and his friends will support
on a platform of Americanism and
preparedness. They profess to believe
that Roosevelt will not run as a third
party candidate.
. Insist on T. R.
George W. Perkins, chairman of the
executive 'committee of the .Progres
sive party, said:
'There have been a number of con
ferences between the Progressive ana
Republican leaders but nothing defi
nite has been accomplished. We are
for Roosevelt to the end and insist he
should be nominated. We are willing
to meet the Republicans half way In
the interest of harmony and we re
peat that harmony is not necessarily
predicated on the nomination of
Roosevelt."
Chauncey M. Depew of New York,
said to be th.3 veteran of the conven
tion, arrived today. He is a delegate
to the convention and will vote for
Elihu Root.
"If this convention wants to nomi
nate the man who is the most able and
best equipped to perform the duties of
president, they will name Root," said
Mr. Depew.

Chicago, June 3. A preparedness
demonstration equal to New York's
gripped Chicago today. It was the
prelude to a series of big events which
throw this city in the world's spotlight
of news, for the next ten days.
Nearly a quarter of a million Chi
cago men, women and children, it is
estimated, marched today in a parade
to arouse the nation to preparedness.
Sober minded men and women bank
ers, politicians, society women, clerks,
shop girls from all walks of life who
want peace but not "at any price"
marched. There were 50,000 marcherB
from the United Young Men's clubs
alone.
One feature of the parade was the
suffragist section. Another was the
motorcycle section, in which several
thousand motorcyclists rode their ma
chines. One hundred and eighty union
chauffeurs offered their cars without
charge to anyone desiring to take part
in the parade. The steel mills in
South Chicago and Gary, Ind.. sent
five thousand men.
Major-Gen. E. C Young headed the
parade. His chjef aid was Col. Milton
J. Foreman of the. First Illinois Cav
alry regiment, one o the best equipped
cavalry bodiej in the National Guard.
H. L. Van Wuck, who organized the
huge preparedness parade held in New
York City recently, co-operated with
August Hibbard of Chicago in organ
izing today's demonstration.
It was estimated there were more
than a million spectators.
Through Tonight.
At noon after three hours of march
ing, 65,009 persona in the great pre
paredness parade had passed the re
viewing stand. This was at a much
faster rate than at the beginning ow

At this speed It would be possible
to conclude the parade by 9 or 10
o'clock tonight.

set for Memorial Day, as a reception
for Colonel Roosevelt, but it was post
poned following a cry of "politics."
SWEET JS GUILTY
Convicted of Murder of Nellie
Byers, Teacher.
His Own Story Brought Verdict
Notice of Appeal.
Syracuse, Kan., June S. Archie
Sweet, a farm hand, today was found
guilty of first decree murder for the
killing of Miss Nellie J. Byers, a Grant
county school teacher.
Archie Sweet's own story convicted
him of the murder.
A notice of an appeal was made by
Sweet's attorneys.
Sweet received the verdict calmly.
When the decision was announced he
arose and followed Sheriff McCarter
back to the jail without speaking
Later he said:
"I am innocent, but I'm going to
take my medicine like a man. When
I'm sentenced all they will have to
do will be to give me my ticket to the
penitentiary and I will report to the
warden."
The jury was given the case for con
sideration last night. A verdict was
reached on the second ballot taken.
Under the verdict Sweet will be
sentenced to the penitentiary for life.
The court will hear a motion for a
new trial within two weeks. No defi
nite date was set. . Only a few per
sons were in the court room when the
verdict was returned. There was no
demonstration.
Most Brutal Murder.
The murder was one of the most
brutal ever committed in Kansas. Miss
Byers. who was 23 years old. was a
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Byers.
Her father was once a member of the
Kansas legislature.
The body of the school teacher was
found concealed in weeds near a lonely
road on October 23, 1915, near here.
Her clothes had been torn from her
body. A sweater she wore had been
wound tightly about her neck. Teeth
marks upon her body gave the au
thorities hope of finding the guilty
man.
Bloodhounds brought from Dodge
City followed a. Trail to the house
where Sweet lived. He surrendered
but maintained his innocence. He
declared he was being made a scape
goat for the persons who really com
mitted the crime.
The trial began May 22.

A long distance telephone to the

so that it was possible for the colonel

If the colonel received any reports
from Chicago he did not disclose them.
Ke absolutely refused to discuss the

that conditions are much more favor

The colonel read the Hughes state

made the same -emark with regard to

GREATEST FIGHT IN HISTORY
Fifteen British Warships Sent
to Bottom.
English Admiralty Points Out
Signs of Victory. ; '
BULLETIN.
London, June 3. The German
dreadnaught Westfalin, of 18.300 tons,
has been added to the steadily grow
ing list of -vessels sunk In the great
naval engagement off Wie Jutland
coast, according to a wireless dispatch
from Berlin, which says the German
admiralty admits the loss of this war
ship. London, June S. Developments to
day clearly showed that the entire
British and German high seas fleets
were engaged on "Wednesday in tne
greatest naval battle In the history of
the world.
Sir John Jelllcoe, In supreme com
mand of the British naval forces, di
rected the English fight, with Vice
Admiral Scheer, Germany supreme
power on the seas, heading the kais
er's armada.
Against more than fifteen British
ships which were sent to the bottom,
German losses were uamiy no..
large, but Britons found satisfaction
today when it was learned that Jelli
coe and his dreadnaughts had faced
the enemy, that not a ship of the
first powerful lin- was lost.- and
that the German dreadnaughts were
forced to return to their base.
Two Rear Admirals Lost.
It Is now estimated that fully 6,000
British officers and men went down
with their ships. Rear Admirals Hood
and Arbuthnot were lost.
As the port commander admitted
there was no hope for further sur
vivors being picked up. He said the
British losses will undoubtedly total
about 5,000 men.
Known losses announced did not In
clude mention of about ten destroyers,
each carrying a crew of 100 men.
which were lost. . This would increase
the death toll by 1,000, although it
was stated "a few survivors" of the
Tipperary have been picked up, mak
ing a probable total of 6.000. Ger
many's loss probably exceeded half
that number.
The highest ranking officers who
went down with their ships were Rear
Admiral Horace Hood and Rear Ad
miral Arbuthnot. Hood went down
with the Invincible and Arbuthnot
with the Defense.
Britten Undaunted.
British spirit is undaunted and de
spite the loss of such ships as the
Queen Mary and Invincible, of which
all England was proud, together with
a dozen other warcraft, the disaster
of the North sea battle is viewed phil
osophically today.
Chief regret centers In the loss of
officers and men. - The lost ships oan
be replaced and at all events Britain's
sea superiority is still two to one over
the Germans, Englishmen grimly de
clared. One of the chief reasons for the
heavy British losses is found in the
fact pointed out by experts nere that
German dreadnaughts first line ves
sels of the kaiser's navy were op
posed by nothing heavier than Brit
ish cruisers until the English dread
naughts appeared.
Didn't Fert FuU Force.
In response to wireless calls and
hurried signals from torpedo boats

aid to the assailed cruiser squadron.
tne great nrst line snips or .Britain
swung forward to the scene of battle.
When they appeared, however, the
Germans tied and the British still
maintain -.oday that Germany has yet
to feel the full force of English sea
power.
Efficient Zeppelin scouting enabled
the Germans at all times to locate
passing warship. Hovering above 'the
German high sea fleet as It pounded
tne ritisn cruisers and destroyers to
pieces, the Zeppelins were able to give
warning of the approach of the dread
naughts, hastening to the aid of the
outnumbered squadron. Then came
withdrawal, successful retreat to the
German naval base, and the super
fighting machines of Great Britain
could only return to their home wa
ters. Zeppelins Gave Timely Aid.
As a result of the assistance ren
dered by the Zeppelins, a general de
mand is being voiced today that tho
British navy be equipped with scout
ing air forces.
In some quarters the suggestion la
being made that Sir John Fisher be
returned to active control of the navy.
