Great Britain and Ger
many again have met in bat
tle at sea, and Germany, ap
parently, so far as the de
tails have been made known,
was the victor. At the bot
tom of the North Sea, off the
west coast of northern Den
mark, lie at least three Brit
ish battle cruisers, three
cruisers and eight torpedo
boats, and the German bat
tleship Pommern and two
small German cruisers and a
number of German torpedo
craft.
Great Britain admits the
loss of battle cruisers and
cruisers with a tonnage of
114,810, represented by the
battle cruisers Queen Mary,
Indefatigable and Invinci
ble and the cruisers Defi
ance, Black Prince and War
rior.
Germany's losses, in ad
dition to the Pommern, were
the Wiesbaden and Frauen
lobb, both the latter small
cruisers, and several torpedo
boats.
The Germans claim, in ad
dition to the admitted losses
of Great Britain, that the
British Warspite, of the
largest type in the British
navy, was sunk; that the bat
tleship Marlborough was hit
by a torpedo, and that two
cruisers of the Achilles type
and one submarine were sent
to the bottom.
The British admiralty
adds to the conceded losses
by the Germans, two dread
naughts of the Kaiser class,
vessels of 24,700 tons, de
stroyed; the blowing up of
one battle cruiser, the dam
aging of two other vessels of
this class and the ramming
and sinking of a German
submarine.

GREATEST NAVAL BATTLE
HI TWO SUCH
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
From the advices thus far received
It would appear that the greatest
naval battle of history has taken
place. Never before have two naval
forces of such magnitude as the Brit
ish and German hiRh sea fleets en
gaged in combat. But aparently the
battle was not fought out to a point
to determine mastery of the seas, for
thi" losses, serious as they are report
ed to have been, will not impair the
strength of either fleet to a vital ex
tent. The scene of the battle was in the
eastern waters of the North Sea. It
is probable that the fleet was on one
of the excursions into the North Sea
which it has taken from time to time
during the war and met, whether or
not by design, with the British fleet.
Skngerak is an arm of the North
Sea between Norway and Denmark.

German statement as Horn Riff prob

" BERLIN, June
Sayville) The German admiralty an-
nounced today that the German high
sea fleet on May 31 had encountered
a British fighting fleet. The en
gagement which developed, the ad
miralty says, was favorable to the
Germans. The battle continued all
night.
The German admiralty announces
that the large British battleship
Warspite, the battle cruisers Queen
Mary and Indefatigable, and two ar
mored cruis?rs were destroyed.
It is also reported that a small
British cruiser a number of torpedo
boat destroyers and torpedo boats
were sunk.
The German admiralty statement
adds that by observation it was
established that a large number ot
British battleships suffered damage
from the fire of the big German
ships and the attacks of the torpedo
boat fleet.
The admiralty statement also de
clares that the British battleship
Marborough was hit by a torpedo,
this being confirmed by the prisoner
rescued. Several of the German ships j
rescued parts of the crews of the i
LiiUsh which were sunk this included
It is said two men from the Indefa
tigable, the only survivors from that
ship.
On the German side the small crui
ser Wiesbadan was sunk by gun
and the Pommern was sent to
fjr(,
the
bottom by a torpedo. The fate of the I
Frauenlob is not known and some
torpedo boats did not return. The
German high sea fleet, the state
ment adds, returned to port, June 1.
The text of the German admiralty
report, which is dated June 1, says:

News of the engagement was held
back by the British authorities, pos
sibly pending the return home of the
fleet and the first word received of
the battle came by wireless from Ber
lin; by which means the Germans are
able to escape the censorship over
cable lines. '
The loss in the engagement must
have been extremely heavy. The bat
tle cruiser Indefatigable, for instance,
from which the German admiralty re
torts only two men were saved, prob
ably had more than 9U0 men on board
and others of the vessels sunk car
ried complements of men equally or
nearly as large.
The Dreadnaught Warspite was a
sister ship of the Quern Elizabeth,
both of which played a prominent I
part in the attempt f the British
Mediterranean fleet to force the Dar
danelles. The Warspite was 650 feet
long and dislaced 27,560 tons. She
was built in 1914 ata cost of $15,
r.OO.Of'O. The Warspite is reported to
have carried eight IS inch guns in
Place of the 15 inch guns carried by
the Queen Elizabeth. She also was
equipped with twelve or sixteen six
inch gun?, twelve four inch guns, four
three pounders and was fitted with
four 21 inch torpedo tubes. Her com

DRASTIC ORDER
TD THREE GENTS
In compliance with an order issued
yesterday by the corporation commis
sion, the four largest railroads in the
state will on August 1. 1916 reduce
their passenger rates, in all but one
case to three cents per mile. The one
road exempted is the Arizona Eastern,
and they will be allowed to charge
three and one-half cents per mile on
the T hrienix division, and on the Globe
C.'chise division, a rate of four cents
per mile per passenger will be allowed.
The former rates on these divisions
were three and one-hall cents per mile,
and four cents per mile The three
roads which will be forced to reduce
heir rates so drastically are the
Southern Pacific. The Ray and Gila
Valley and the Santa Fe.
The o-der handed down by the com
mission is one or the most important
ever 'ssued by that body. The hearing
at which the railroads were allowed to
state their side of the question was
held about two months ago and was
fought from start to finish by the cor
ooration attorneys.
The printed order, as prepared for
'lie use of the roads, is one mass of fig
ores and statistics, prepared In the
main by Rate Expert A. A. Betts of the
commission, who was one of the star
witnesses for the state.
The railroads which are exemptel
from the three' cent order, are The El

WASHINGTON, June 2. Despite the
threatening tone of General Carranza's
last note, his military forces in Chi
huahua state are being dispersed in
general accord with the plan disclosed
by General Obregon during his confer
ence at El Paso with Generals Scott
and Kunston. This was shown today
when General Funston sent word that
the 20,000 Carranza soldiers mobilized
within the last few days at Chihuahua
City had been spread over the region
not controlled by General Pershing's
column, In a way to carry out an active
pursuit of bandits.
Secretary Baker said that General
Obregon had promised to send a large
number of men in pursuit of the ban
dits and all war department advices
j indicated that this plan was being car
I ried out. He added that he now knew
nothing to prevent the sending of new
i expeditions into Mexico after raidersi
provided a hot trail was followed.
Otherwise, he declined to discuss state
ments in the Carranza note, particu
larly those portions that contend that
General Scott promised that no more
troops would be sent into Mexico. Mr.
Baker holds that any discussion of the
note is a state department matter.
He has placed in the hands of Secre
tary Lansing a complete written report
of the conference, prepared by General
Scott.
rmy officers who studied the Mexi
can troop dispositions as reported oy
General Funston, said they appeared
to be in accord with a plan to police
the country and did not indicate the
preparation of an unfriendly demon
stration toward General Pershing's
force. The Mexicans have been, for
the most part, distributed in small
commands to police definite sections.
No large force is being held in one
place, and the reports added that no
entrenchments or entanglements had
been constructed. So far, there has
been nothing to show that military
preparations for an attempt to drive
out the Americans have been- set in
motion. On the other hand, reliable
information has been received in of
ficial quarters that all of Carranza's
advisers stand solidly behind him in
the expressions of his note. Nothing
has come to indicate the temper of the
people, either in Mexico City or else
where in the country, following its
publication.
News of renewed activity by the
followers of Zapata in Southern Mexi
co, officially reported today to the
state department, may change the
military dispositions of the Mexican
forces in Chihuahua. If the situation
is as serious as indicated General Ob
regon may be compelled to recall some
of his forces in the north. It has been
stated, but without specific authority,
that 50,000 men were being concen
trated in the north. Official reports
have placed the number at 20,000. At
any rate, officers here think a large
enough portion of Carranza's available
forces have been moved north to weak
en his control in the southern parts.
There were iot indications today
that the state department was prepar
ing to make an early reply to the de
mand for withdrawal or for a definite
statement of the intentions of the
United States toward" Mexico. Coun
sellor Polk conferred several times with
Secretary Baker but it was not dis
closed what aspects of the situation
were under discussion.
It is knowji that the officials feel
that the purposes of the United States
have beep stated over and over again
In language that would bear no mis
understanding. President Wilson him
self has stated his views fully and
clearly, both in public addresses and in
official statements to the American
people. They feel also that the good
faith of these statements has been

CHICAGO, June 2 There were num
erous conferences between party lead
ers today but so far It is believed
no agreement on candidates was
reached and there was no development
that accurately indicated which candi
date is likely to be nominated for pres
ident by the republican national con
vention. While on the surface the fight ap
pears to be between Roosevelt and
Hughes or Roosevelt against the field
there was a marked disiosition to con
cede more strength to the favorite
sons candidates.
Managers of the Root, Weeks, Bur
ton, Fairbanks, Cummins and Sher
man booms insisted that their candi
dates would remain in the fight until
the end. They declared after tabu
lating the vote claimed for Roosevelt
that the successful candidate will he
dither one of the favorite sons or a
dark horse. The plan of the old organ
izational leaders is said to be to try
and win first with Root and if the?
fail in this effort to give Burton,
Weeks, Fairbanks and Sherman a try
out in the convention in the order
named. In the event of failing to pu;
over any of these the plan is to try
and win with a dark horse, according
to reports in circulation. Senator
Warren G. Harding of Ohio, and Gov
ernor McCall, of Massachusetts were
mentioned as possibilities.
Frienfls of Roosevelt claim he will
win after the formality of giving the
favorite son candidates a complimen

the proceedings.
