writer in a power
ful eastern newspaper
discusses the chances
and capabilities o f
many presidential can
didates. He discusses
them, damns most of
them with faint praise
and finally turns theni
all dowi, then asks:
"Why not elect a real
president next Novem
ber? Why not elect
Roosevelt?"
To oblige him, we do
not mind giving a few
reasons why we should
be sorry to see him the
Republican candidate.
(1) He is not a Re
I publican as he demon
: i strated four years ago,
I when, for the sake of
I revenge, he did what
! he knew would elect a
gentleman whom he
also knew would ruin
much of the good that
had been wrought by
the Republicans while ,
in power.
(2) He is not politic
ally honest as was dem-
Ionstrated by his
speeches four years
' ago, in which he pic
tured the perils that
threatened the country,
l though during the
seven years of his pres-
k idency those p e r i 1 b
1 were just as apparent
and imminent as they
i were then, and they
K had never disturbed
I him a moment or called
jfl' out a protest from him
t ' against them.
Kb (3) Though seven
,years president h e
If never learned that con-
L gress and the supreme
yC court were co ordinate
r branches of the govern-
II ment, with him they
L were both in the way
flf the president was
K "the hull thing."

" ON. FRANKLIN S. RICHARDS was born in Salt Lake City on the 20th of June, 1849, the
son of Franklin Dewey Richards and J ane Snyder Richards, pioneers of the previous year.
I I At that time Salt Lake City was but a pitiable hamlet clinging to the fringe of the desert
as might an eagle's aerie to a barren mountain's crest. He early learned that the lives of
men primarily depended on food and faith and that the way to keep an equilibrium was when the
former was not so very plenty the later must be more and more drawn upon.
For the rudiments of an education he attended the public schools and this was supplemented
by a private school. But he progressed so rapidly that he became principal of the foremost public
school in Salt Lake City in 18G6 and held the place until 18G9, when he removed to Ogden.
In 1870 he bemme county clerk and recorder of Weber county and held that position for seven
years. He was admitted to the bar in 1872. He became prosecuting attorney and retained that
office until his removal to Salt Lake City in 1884. He was city attorney of Salt Lake City from
1884 to 1890 and since then has been special counsel for the city in many important cases. He has
been general counsel for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since 1880 and has often
represented his church and its members before the supreme court of the United States, wherein ques
tions of constitutional law were involved.

pretence that personal- jjfl
ly he would fain prefer rfl
the quiet of his home, l
but was willing at any p,l
personal sacrifice to Il
serve his country and 1 I
his countrymen, when 1 1
in truth, he was as he I I
is today, consumed by ill
an insatiable desire to HI
be ever in the lime- 111
light, or, in ruder lang- III
uage, to be the chief jl
trick pony in the ring. I
(G) Because by his I
acts and often by his H
plagiarized words he H
has given ample proof H
that his promptings H
are precisely the same H
as have been those of H
every despot that has H
ever robbed from a H
trusting people their IH
liberties. H
(7) Because he fully H
demonstrates that he is IH
as crazy for power and H
place as he is utterly fl
destitute of gratitude El
or appreciative of the H
honors and e m o 1 u - 1MH
ments that have been
bestowed upon him and !H
is so inherently vain H
and egotistical that he jjjl
would scruple at noth- M
ing to realize his ambi- M
(8) Because he- has M
repeatedly shown that M
had he been in Caesar's J
place no Antony could M
have "thrice presented M
him a kingly crown," M
he would have grabbed M
it at the first presenta- M
tion and then made a M
speech declaring that it M
would be a mighty sac- M
rifice on his part to M
wear the diadem, that M
only his desire to serve $
the people prompted M
him to accept the sacri- M
flee; even as every H
petty chief in Mexico M
to hear him tell it, al- M
ways starts his revolu- M
tion to give full free- M
dom to his countrymen. M
(9) Because when M
president, he was never M
a "great" president. M
While denouncing mon- M
opolies he always, after M
Hay's death, followed M
the advice of Senator M
Piatt, and finally gave H
his sanction to the Ten- H
