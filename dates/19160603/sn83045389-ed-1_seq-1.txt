under a single roof in fii* hie-.orv of

the State convent ion, 1ip was Roundinp
the keynote speech. It was a plea to !
delegates who loss than a week before
were busy in preparation for what ;
promises to be the bitterest factional
struggle in a generation.
The plea bore fruit. Through the
long hours that followed before mid
night hardly an utterance came from
the floor or platform that did not echo j
the sentiment. The major elections fpl
lowed without deviation the peace pro- j
gram that was promulgated last week I
in Washington

Rorer A. James, of Danville, and
Carter Glass, of Lynchburg, mounted
the platform a few minutes apart.
Each in his own words paid his tribute
to the united Democracy that had hon
ored them so signally.
Strictly in accordance with the terms
of the peace of Washington, the con
vention elected Mr. Glass as the Vir
ginia member of the National Demo
cratic Committee and Mr. James as
chairman of the State committee. 1
Both offices had been held by Dieute^-j
ant-Governor J. Taylor 1011yson for :
more than twenty years. Likewise, in !
accordance with the peace terms. Rep-J
resentatlve Hal D. Flood, of the Tenth
District, was elected one of the four j
delegates at large to the St. Louis con
vention. The other three delegates at
large, chosen in accordance with estab
lished precedent, are Govrnor Henry C.
Stuart and Senators Thomas S. Martin
and Claude A. Swanson.
Late at night, when the. 1,200 dele
gates and 3,000 spectators had cheered
themselves hoarse at every recurring
mention of President Wilson's name,
and had greeted with patriotic demon
stration a long succession of favorite
sons, the convention with one voice
adopted the report of Its committee on
resolutions, indorsing unreservedly the
policy of the present national admin
istration, and directing the twenty
four. delegates from Virginia to vote
as a unit for the renominntion of
Staunton's son?Woodrow Wilson.
To the "preparedness" Issue the con- I
vention adverted twice. One section of i
its formal resolution notes the fact
that "no navy In English or American
history ever endangered the liberties
of-the people," and approves "any rea
sonable expenditure which may be
necessary to equip and maintain the
efficiency of the American navy." An
other .section, reviewing the construc
tive acts of the administration, regis
ters the- convention's approval of the
party's action in enacting measures
"looking to the national defense, one
of which assures a basis for such ex
pansion of the army and militia of the
States' as to provide adequate protec
tion against any Immediate or future
foreign aggression."

"On the right hank of the Meuse the

Platform on Which Virginia
Democracy Takes Its Stand
[Special From a Staff Correspondent.]
CONVENTION HALL. ROANOKE,
VA., June 2.?The State Democratic
Convention, by a unanimous vote,
to-night adopted as its own the fol
lowing report of its committee on
resolutions;
The committee on resolutions begs
leave to report that several resolu
tions and proposed planks for the
platform were presented to the com
mittee dealing with the Stat* issues,
but the committee, after lengthy
discussion, determined not to deal
with anything save national issues,
and in lieu of action on the afore
said resolutions and planks adopts
the following resolution:
"Resolved. That this convention
requests the State Democratic Com
mittee to call a State convention
prior to the first day of June. 1917,
for the purpose of adopting a plat
form covering State issues."
The Democratic party of Virginia,
in convention assembled, heartily
indorses the policies of the national
administration and gives its unquali
fied approval of the masterly conduct
of the public affairs of the nation
unrler Woodrow Wilson, a great
Democratic President, and It but
expresses the unanimous demand of
our people in asking for his renomi
natlon at St. Louis and instructing
the delegates from this State to vote
as a unit to make him a^aiti our
standard bearer.
It likewise indorses the sturdy
zeal and fidelity to his chief of
Thomas R. Marshall, the Vice-Presi
dent, and earnestly commends him
for renomination at the hands of
his party.
ELEVATES AMERICAN XAMK
IX FAMILY OF NATIONS
Since the first administration of
Washington, no executive has been
called upon to deal with foreign
relations more complicated than
those which have fallen to the lot
of President Wilson, nnd yet he has
so conducted the duties of his high
office as to raise the standard of
diplomacy and elevate the American
name in the family of nations.
Though all Europe has been turned
into an armed camp and the tread
of its armies has been heart! around
the world, though our country has
been threatened with danger from
without and tried with countless
difficulties within, yet the President
has preserved the peace of his coun
try without the. sacrifice of its
honor or of a sinprlc right of the
American people.
His firm and patriotic champion
ship of American and neutral rights
upon the high seas against the
encroachment of all belligerents gives
strong promise of victory which
must redound in benefit to our com
merce and to the lasting glory of
peaceful diplomacy.
Neither the financial slake hejd
by Americans In Mexico nor the
desire for conquest, so strong with
men of our race, has tempted the
President to permanently intervene
with force in the affairs of a sister
republic. But when this country
was invaded and Its people attacked
immediate action was taken to pun
ish the perpetrators of the outrage
and the country given assurance
that American life and property will
always be promptly protected.
His maintenance of the Monroe
Doctrine and the. calling to Its
defense our sister republics to the
south have produced n feellnp of con
fidence and trust between pur gov
ernment and all Pan-American coun
tries and resulted in agreements
which assure, not only their friend
ship. but the rapid extension of
trade in Central and South America.
STAND WITH PRESIDENT
FOR A51 ERICA FIRST
We stand as one with the Presi
dent in holding the Interests of his
own country to be first In reference
to all questions arising out of the
world war, and with him we place
citizenship above partisanship in
every matter involving either the
duty of Americans at home or their
honor and security abroad.
The Democratic party, in control
of t.l.e government for the first time
in a generation, has placed more
legislation beneficial to the people,
upon the statute books in the brief
space of three years than can be
claimed for any single administra
tion in the history of the govern
ment.
It has for the first time since
1S!"? 4 given the people a tariff gen
uinely enacted for the people sup
porting the government, and not to
protect those prown rich upon un
equal tax laws: it has passed the
income-tax law. thus shifting a larce
part of the burden of taxation from
the pour and those best able to pay;
in the Federal reserve act It has
emancipated 'he commercial and In
dustrial enterprises of the land from
the thralldom of ?reat banking cen
ters. has decentralized the banking
capital of the country, lias localized
credit and provided a safe and
soutul banking system which oupht
to protect the people against the
evils of the heretofore ever-recur
ring financial panics; it has strength
ened and defined the antitrust laws
so that legitimate business can know
its legal rights, but combinations of
capital no longer oppress without
answering at the liar of justice; and,
finally, while steadfastly advocating
peace so long as peace could come
with honor, but realizing that we
lived in no ordinary times and
were heset with danger, the. party
has wisely and patriotically enacted
measures looking to the national
defense, one of which assures a
basis for such expression of the
army and militia of the States as to
provide adequate protection against
any immediate or futur? foreign
aggression.
MEAN I IIES NOW I'EN 1)1 NO
ARK CIVEN A l'l'ltllVA I.
The measures supporter! by the
party and now pending hi Congress
to provide for national aid for good
roads and vocational education; to
purchase, own and operate merchant
ships for a limited period; to
sive independence to the Philippine
Islands, and to establish a farmers'
land-bank system, whereby the agri
cultural community can obtain capi
tal upon terms of long time and at
low rates of interest, are entitled to
cordial approval and support.
No navy in English or American
history overendangered the liberties
of the people, and as our first line
of defense in time of possible war
we approve any reasonable" expendi
ture which may be necessary to
equip and maintain the efficiency of
the American navy.
We are gratified to know that the
delegation from this State cordially
and faithfully co-operated in sus
taining every important measure of
the national administration, and we.
therefore, approve the record of the
Honorables Thomas S. Martin and
Claude A. Swanson, Senators, and of
the Representatives from Virginia in
the Congress of the United States
We heartily indorse and approve
the wise, businesslike and patriotic
administration of Henry C. Stuart.
Governor of Virginia, together with
the record of the last General

branches by the Democratic party.
(t is upon its record of promises

most of mankind are In want we
have plenty. Peace and prosperity

LONDON, June 2.?Picking its way
from Its base In the Kiel Canal, the
German High Sea Fleet on Wednesday
afternoon emerged into the North Sea
and off the coast of Jutland engaged a
British fleet through the. afternoon and
night in what probably was the great- i
est naval battle In the world's history,
so far as tonnage engaged and tonnage
destroyed was concerned.
When the battle ended Great Britain
had lost the battle cruisers Queen
Mary, Indefatigable and Invincible, the
cruisers Defense, lilavh Prince and War
rior, and eight torpedo-boat destroyers,
while the German battleship Pommern
had been sent to the bottom by a tor
pedo. and tne cruiser Wiesbaden sunk
by the llrltish guntlre. In addition sev
eral German torpedo craft were miss
ing, and the small cruiser Frauenloeb
had last been seen badly listed and was
believed to have gone to the bottom.
These losses ha.ve all been admitted by
Great Britain and Germany.
Aside from Great Britain's conceded
losses. Germany claims that the Brit
ish battleship Warsplte, sister ship of
the Queen Klisaheth, and one of the
largest ana most powerful ships afloat,
had been sunk, that the battleship
.Marlborough, a vessel of 25,000 tons,
had been hit hv a torpedo, and a sub
marine had been destroyed.
UitlJAT Hit MAIN ADD*
TO GKK.MA.Y ADMISSION'S
Great Britain also added to Ger
many's acknowledged losses with the
claim that one Dreadnought of the
G<-r:nan Kaiser class?vessels of 21,700
tons and carrying a complement of
1.08S men?had been destroyed by Brit
ish torpedo craft, that another battle
ship of the same rlass was believed to
have been sunk by gunflre, that one
battle cruiser had been blown up. and
two others damaged, and that a sub
marine also had been sent to t.he
bottom.
Great Britain's admitted loss in ton
i nage was 111,810 for the six battle
| cruisers anil cruisers. That of Ger
many, excluding the tonnage of the
; Wiesbaden, of which v?ssel there is no
i record, wan 1,1,712.
That the casulties in the fighting oft
Jutland were heavy is indicated by
the fact that of the crew of some 1,000
on board the Indefatigable, only two
men are known to have been saved.
Full details of the light, in which Zep
pelins are declared to have taken part,
tare beiiiR gathered by the British ad
miralty ami pending their receipt, the
censor is withholding permission to
| correspondents to send out stories from
; London.
Great Britain and Germany again
have met at sea. and Germany appar
ently. so far as the details have been
made known, was the victor. At the
bottom of the Nortfi Sea, off the west
coast of Northern Denmark, lie at least
three British battle cruisers, three
cruisers and eight torpedo-boats, and
! the German battleship Pommern and
two small German cruisers and a num
ber of German torpedo craft.
Great Britain admits the loss of bat
tie cruisers and cruisers with a ton
nap.- of ill.sift?represented by the
battle cruisers Queen Mary, Indefatig
able and Invincible, and the cruisers
Defence, Black Prince and Warrior.
Germany's losses-, in addition to the
Pommern. were the Wiesbaden and
Frauenloeb. both the latter small cruis
ers. and several torpedo-boats. The
Germans claim In addition to the ad
| mitted losses of Great Britain, that the
British battleship Warspite, of th*
largest type in the British navy, WJMj
sunk, that the battleship Marlborough
was hit by a torpedo, and that twt
cruisers of the Achilles type <the War<
