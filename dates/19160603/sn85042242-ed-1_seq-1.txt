BY A STAFF CORRESPONDENT.
Stanton, N. D., June 2.—Perfect
weather, congenial company and rous­
ing receptions greeted the Commercial
club trade extension trip which left
Bismarck shortly after 7 A. M. this
morning. Accompanied by the band
in a special train consisting of three
coaches and baggage car,100 Bismarck
boosters are extending a glad hand to
this prosperous and enterprising dist
rict.
Crop conditions along the Bismarck
Killdeer branch are ideal. Seeding
is well along and there has been a
material increase in the average.
Bankers and merchants are looking
forward, to a banner year and are lay­
ing in large stocks in anticipation of
a bumper crop.
The feeling toward Bismarck is cor­
dial in the extreme. Everywhere the
special stopped, a reception committee
greeted the trade extensionists.
Leaving Bismarck, the route ex­
tends *lon& the picturesque Missouri
river valley through an ^specially
fertile country stretching back for
miles tin ach si&e.
Every facility lias been afforded by
the Northern Pacific for the Cbmfort
of the' Loosters. City Agent Mcdon­
ald and,, W:ii am T. Kraft, traveling
p.issengtfr ppei.i of the Nouhe-ii Paci­
fic with the party'and tbey left
nothing: undone to add to the comfort
and success of the trip.
Secretry Price did the honors for
the Commercial club, under whose
auspices this trip is being held. An
atractive folder, entitled 'Bismarck,"
tilled with concise information of the
Capital City, was distributed. It con­
tained an editorial, "When Good Fel­
lows Get Together." As the senti­
ments expressed well the spirit of
the trip, we quote:
"Bismarck, the Capital City of
North Dakota—the Queen City of the
Missouri Slope— a number of years
ago adopted the wise policy of spend­
ing a day now and then in traveling
about, Beting better acquainted with
lit" neighbors.
"The first of these 'Get-Acquainted'
tours this year—and probably the
most elaborate whicli will be made
by the Capital City—brings us to your
jjood town. We come with a, high
appreciation of your community and
of the men who have made it what it
is today. We will depart, we know,
wilh an even better estimate of your
lown and its possibilities. And, if we
can leave, in turn, some idea of that
new spirit which prevails today in Bis­
marck, we will feel that we have ac­
complished a great deal in the all-too
fahort time we have to spend with you.
Bismarck believes in you and your
town. Bismarck has watched your
progress during the last few years
has grasped the efforts which you are
putting forth, and has gloried in your
success. Bismarck believes in all of
iliat country, sometimes referred to as
"West of the River." We believe in
your bis men in your big ideas in
the bie spirit which is making your
influence felt not only in the Missouri
Slope region, but throughout North
Dakota and the great Northwest.
Bismarck comes to you today in the
name of good fellowship—in the in­
terest of better acquaintance. We
hope that you may like us as well as
we like you. We trust that we may
succeed' in making you understand
that the latchstring always hangs out
for you and yours in the Capital City.
We pray that we may make you ap­
preciate the fact that Bismarck, tile
Capita] City of all North Dakota, is
especially your city, with a real inter­
est in you, and your town, and in ev­
erything that helps you and your
town."
Considerable opportunity was given
to boost for Bismarck's big Fourth of
July celebration. Elegant posters set.
ting forth star events billed were dis­
tributed at the various towns and the
prospects are that a large crowd will
attend from this section.
It was about 7:30 when the special
with diner attached, palled out of Bis­
marck. After a good breakfast, with
the ideal June day, the party was in
every way fit when the train pulled
into Man'lan.
The Elks band swung oft and under
the leadership of Prof. Irysh, Mandan
was given an early morning greeting.

SETS GOOD
Executive Issues Proclamation
Calling All to Donate Day's
Labor to Cause
NELSON COUNTY
ASKS FOR SURVEY
Governor L. B. Hanna yesterday is­
sued a proclamation setting aside
June 19-24 as Good Roads Week.
Nelson county has already be^in
to make preparations to observe the
week. It has requested State Engi­
neer J. W. Bliss to prepare compre­
hensive surveys for road improve­
ments.
The proclamation follows:
One of the paramount needs of
North Dakota Is "B'etter Roads." Bet­
ter roads cannot be secured except
through the co-operation of all the
citizens of the state, and it appears
to me that we may increase interest
in better road building and mainten­
ance, as well as secure a material im­
provement of rt)ad conditions by des­
ignating a given ti^ie in which we
may Ui oul resp^t-iva^^
actiVlly~Tiartt:(pate in the Better
Roads Movement by donating one
day's labor or more upon the roads*
Inasmuch as it is probable that
everyone interested cannot meet on
any given day for the purpose of do­
ing such work, and desiring to pro­
mote a greater interest in roads, as
well as to improve their efficiency
Now, Therefore, I, L. B. Hanna, do
hereby proclaim the week of June
19th to 24th, inclusive, as Good Roads
Week in the State of N6rth Dakota
for the year 19-16, and during that
week I would earnestly recommend
that everyone lend his assistance by
donating at least one day's work upon
the roads.
I further earnestly recommend that,
county and township road officials,
farmers' unions, comm^cial clubs,
automobile associations and all other
organizations having for their object
the promotion of the welfare of their
communities, take leading part in
carrying out. the purpose of this proc­
lamation in their respective localT
ties, in order that the results may
not be impaired by lack of effective
organizatiftn and leadership.
(Signed) L. B. HANNA,
Dunn Center gave us one of the
most enthusiastic receptions of the
entire trip. A. O. Nelson, attorney,
in an address of welcome, laid great
stress upon the good feeling that ex­
isted between this enterprising town
and the Capital City.
Stops were made at Hazen, Halli
day, Beulah, Zap, Golden Valley, Dunn
Center and Killdeer.
En route a straw vote was taken.
It was as follows: President, Roose­

Chairman, Says Report
Chicago, June 2.—There were nu­
merous conferences between party
leaders today, but so far as could be
learned, no agreement, on the candi­
dates was reached and no develop­
ment which accurately indicated
whcli candidate is likely lo be nom­
inated for president, by the republi­
can national convention. While on
the surface, the fight appears to be
between Roosevelt, and 'Hughes, or
Roosevelt against the field, there was
a marlvod increase of activity at the
headquarters of the various "favorite
son" candidates. Managers of the
Root, Weeks, Burton, Fairbanks and
Sherman booms insisted that their
candidates would remain in the fight
until the end.
After tabulating the vote claimed
for Roosevel they expressed the opin­
ion that the successful candidate
would, either be one of the "favorite
sons"
a darlc horse. The plan of
the old party leaders is said to be to
try to win first witth Root and if they
fail in this effort, to give Burton.

GREATEST SEA BATTLE
Germans Fail
To Break Line
Near Verdun
Again the Germans have tried, but
ineffectually, to breach the Fren^i
lines near Fort Vaux, northeast of
Verdun. In fighting characterized by
Paris as having been of unprecedent­
ed violence, the Germans threw at­
tack after attack against he French
lines, but French guns tore great
holes in their ranks and threw them
back.
in addition, reinforcing battalions
were caught by the French guns and
were forced to retreat in disorder,
northeastward upon Dieppe.
At one point., however, in the sector
of Damloup, east of Fort Vaux, Ger­
mans captured a portion of Ihe vil­
lage, the other parts of which are oc­
cupied by the French. West, of the
Meuse, around Ilill 304, and Le Mort.
Homme, both sides arc engaged in
heavy artillery duels.
On the Russian fronts, Ihe Ger­
mans have again brought, the Ikskul
bridgehead under bombardment, and
at several points along the lines are
using their big guns against the Rus­
sians. An infantry atack near Zel
bourg was put down by the Russians.
Rome reports desperate fighting be­
tween tJie Austrians ind l?/fflans be­
tween the Adige and Brenta rivers.
Along the Posina and southeast of
Arsiero, Austrian attacks were re­
pulsed with heavy casualties. Bom­
bardment predominates along the re­
mainder of the fronts.
Constantinople says the Russian
center in the Caucasus region has
been forced to retire 20 kilometers,
and that the Turks repulsed a sur­
prise attack on the Turks' left. wing.
Great Britain and Germany again have met in battle at tea, and
Germany, apparently, as far as details have been made known, was
the victor. At the bottom of the North Sea, off the coast of Denmark,?,
lies at least three battle cruisers, three cruisers and eight torpedo.:
boats, and the German Pommern and two small trawlers and a num­
ber of German torpedo craft.
Great Britain admits the loss of battle cruisers and cririsera with a
tonnage of 114,810—represented by the battle cruisers, Queen Mary,
Indefatigable and Invincible, and the cruisers, Defense, Black Prince'
and Warrior. Germany's losses, in addition to the Pommern, were
the Wiesbaden and Frauenlob, both the latter small cruisers, and sev­
eral torpedo boats.
The Germans claim, in addition to the admitted losses of Great
Britain, that the British warship Warspite, of the largest type in
the British navy, was sunk, that the battleship, Marlborough was hit
by a torpedo, and that two cruisers of the Achilles type (the Warrior
is of this class) and one submarine were sent to the bottom.
The British Admiralty adds to the conceded losses by Germany,
two dreadnaughts of the Kaiser class—vessel# of 24,700 ton*—de­
stroyed, the blowing up of one battle cruiser,/ the damaging of two
other vessels of this class, and the ramming and sinking of a Ger­
man submarine.
London, June 2.—The British admiralty announced today that a bat­
tle had occurred in the North Sea between the British and German fleets,
during which a number of German warships were sunk.
The British battle cruisers, Queen Mary and Indefatigable, and the
battleship, Invincible, were sunk.
The cruisers, Defense and Black Prince, also were sunk, and thQ
cruiser, Warrior, was disabled.

DIES AT
Fargo, 'JC. D., June 2.—James Holes,
resident here since 1871, and who is
given credit universally of being the
first man to prove that farming could
be conducted profitably in North Da­
kota, died late this afternoon. An
operation which seemed of minor
consequence preceded his death. *Mr.
Holes was rallying from the effects
of the operation and seemingly in
splendid shape, when he suffered a
relapse and passed away within a
very short time.
He owned the Pioneer farm, which
lies adjacent to the city of Pargo.
He homesteaded this property, now
estimated to be worth $100,000, be­
cause of its proximity to the city.
The engagement which developed, the admiralty said, was farorabta
the Germans. The battle continued all night.
The German admiralty asserts that

Indefatigable, and two armorftd cruis­
ers were destroyed.
The statement adds that by obser­
vation it was established that a large
number of British battleships suffer­
ed damage from the fire of the Ger­
man big ships and the attack of the
torpedo fleet.
The British battleship, Marlbor­
ough, was hit by a torpedo. This was
confirmed by prisoners rescued.
Several of the German ships res­
cued part of the crews of the Brit­
ish ships, which were sunk, they in­
cluding, they said, two men from the
Indefatigable, the only survivors froru
the ship.
Admiral Reports.
Rear Admiral iHebbinghaus, direct­
or of the German admiralty, in mak­
ing the announcement, of the sea bat­
tle to the reichstag, gave no new de­
tails of the fight other than what had
been officially announced by the ad­
miralty, according to a telegram from
Uerlin, forwarded by Reutcr's Am­
sterdam correspondent.
"No complete statement of our
damages or losses yet have been re­
ceived," he said, in conclusion. "Of
course, some of our ships were w?
verely damaged. The main portion
of our fleet returned to harbor will
the men in splendid spirits. Out men,
ships and guns stood the test ot hat
