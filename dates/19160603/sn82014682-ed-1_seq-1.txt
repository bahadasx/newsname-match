' WASHINGTON, XX C June i-
President Wilson today signed the
' army reorganization bilk Senator E.

Among the features of particular
interest to Hawaii in this bill is that
It provides for the appointment f the

by the President, the adjutant-general
to be m resident of the-Territory.
' News that the "President bad signed
I be army bill caused rejoicing In army
headquarters this rooming when trans
mit tod there by the Star-Bulletin. Be
cause the President fcad delayed for
so many days tn signing the measure,
it was coming to be the feeling with
more tlian one officer that it might
be rejected altogether, v .
Officers Vbo nae been studying on
the, "examinations for promotion will
ta-ke new lease on their work, it w as
pointed out today, and mill bend every
effort to their books for a ehance.at
the promotions fhich are to take

Clerks, st bead quarters. Are still
doubtful as to what their portion is
to be among the schemes for Increas
ing the armsV but It Is generally felt
that some sort of an Increase In pay
or privileges mill be accorded them.
The rews that the bill bad passed
the President also caused a sigh of re
lief from officials of the- National
Guard, who ill be affected materially
bv the appointment. Details of mhai
the bill mill do for, the Guard are
given on the army page in today's is-,
