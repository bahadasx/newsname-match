JUNE 14 HOLIDAY UPTOJUITW
House Said to Be Eagerh
Awaiting Chance to Pass
Resolution.
MAJORITY LEADER STAVES
OFF ACTION, IT IS SAIC
1 T? T "LI,
jjismci commissioners riuuauij
Will Lead D. C. Building
Division in Parade.
Whether Flag day, June 14, will be i
legal holiday in the District of Columbia
depends upon Representative Claude
Kitchin. democratic leader in the
House. If he throws his support to the
joint resolution declaring June 14. 1916
a legal holiday in the District, whicl
was adopted by the Senate yesterday
it is declared the measure will pass the
House.
The joint resolution was forwarded tc
the House this morning and member!
of the preparedness parade committee
immediately got busy with members
of the lower body and urged them tc
work for its passage.
Representative Kitchin said the resolution
would not be taken up by th<
House today. He was not sure whethei
he would present it to the House Monday.
The joint resolution will receive the
support of the minority if Representative
Mann, the republican leader, has
his way. Representative Mann is heartily
in accord with the plan for a preparedness
parade and thinks it is a
hue idea.
Surprised at Mr. Kitchin.
Considerable surprise was expressed
today that Representative Kitchin was
not inclined to present the resolutior
to the House. It could have come ui
under unanimous consent, the same
course having been pursued in the Sen
ate yesterday. Both democratic anc
republican members of the House were
eagerly awaiting an opportunity toda>
to vote on the resolution.
Secretary Columuus 01 the preparedness
parade committee was assured b>
a number of members that the mattei
would be brought up Monday and thai
there was no question in their mindi
that the resolution would pass with
the same alacrity with which it was
carried through the Senate.
Senator Chamberlain of Oregon, chairman
of the Senate military affairs committee,
today arose in his place on the
floor of the Seriate and on behalf of the
citizens' committee in charge of the
parade, invited the members of the
Senate to participate. Senator Chamberlain
himself "has already indicated
his willingness and desire to march.
May Lead D. C. Employes.
The District Commissioners probably
will head the District building division
in the preparedness parade.
The suggestion is under consideration
and theie is a strong probability
that at least two of the municipal government
heads. Commissioner Newman
and Maj. Kutz, will march in the procession.
Commissioner Brownlow probably
will be in St. .Louis at that time
attending the democratic national convention.
The Commissioners have sent a communication
to every branch of the District
government, cabling attention tc
the plans for the para.de and inquiring
to what extent municipal employes are
tics.roas of participating in it. As
soon as replies are received definite
arrangements will be made for the organization
of a division of municipal
government marchers. The District
ouuding representation is expected tc
be a large one.
U. S. Supreme Court Interested.
Members of the Supreme Court of th<
United States are planning to take
part in the parade, according to Col
Henry May, who is engaged in organizing
the membership of the various
clubs into marching units. Col. Maj
told the preparedness parade committee
today that Justice Pitney is planning
u> march with the Metropolitar
Club representation and that the othei
justices probably would march wit!
their fellow club members.
Members of the various suffrage organizations
of the District and others
favorable to suffrage who contemplate
participation in the preparedness
parade have been asked to registei
their names as soon as possible wit!
Mrs. Alice Lee Moque, 1641 Harvarc
street northwest.
Children of the Church of the Epiphany
are to be in the parade, according
to word received by the committee today
from Rev. Percy Foster Hall, as
sistant rector. Members of the con
gregation are to acfompany them. Dr
Hall believes there will be at least 10"
persons from the church in line.

impelling influence upon the outcome.
1 Briefly, since this is a short day and
there is much else to demand attention

First, that a reaction has set in against s

nacted into law the National Capit
ill be made the most beautiful in t!
orld.
When Senator Works offered his b

lanation of the plan, saying:
Explanation of the Plan.
'"It may be remembered that I ha^
eretofore urged upon the Senate tl
risdom and propriety of acquiring tl
roperty along Pennsylvania aveni
pon which to construct all goven
lent buildings. I believe that soon>
r later this will be done. The bill th;
am now offering is intended to ai
lorize the acquisition of certa
roperty in the city of Washington
e used by the states in the constru*
on of state buildings to be used j
^position buildings, in which to e:
ibit their products and resources, ar
> be made the headquarters of ea<
id all of the states in the Nation
apital.
"The property to be acquired as pr<
ded by the bill commences on Ne
ork avenue at 15th street and e:

"In addition to this the bill pr
ides for the acquisition of addition;
round near the *frater front to 1
sed for the construction of goven

ween B and E streets, on both sidi
f the United States naval museum <
ygiene, from 18th street to 271
treet, consisting of twenty-six squan
nd fractions of squar?rs.
"I submit, to accompany "the bill, tw
laps on which are delineated in r<
le several squares intended to he a>
uired. For the most part the pro]
rty proposed to be taken is compar;
vely inexpensive and cheaply in
roved.
"I am riot offering the bill with ar

Fred B. Lynch, national committee- i
nan from Minnesota and chairman of
he executive committee of the demoratic

lecretary Tumulty about plans for the \

he matter of a permanent chairman is
till unsettled. Speaker Clark was 5

lined on the ground that he ought to
tay in Washington and stick to his r
ob as Speaker of the House. c
President Wilson already has begun
vork on a draft of the platform for the ^
onvention, and it will be taken west (
>y Senator Stone. The President is t
aying particular attention to a plank
lealing witH foreign affairs. While a
hanges may be made by the re,solu- ?
ions committee, and new planks may
?e added, the framework will be made
t the White House. The President's
idvlsers take the position that inasmuch
as the chief fight in the camlaign

he should take a leading part
