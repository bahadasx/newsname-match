As a result of the assistance ren

Editorial Comment.
LONDON, June 3—Editorials in the
leading English papers agree that
Great Britain has suffered her heavi
est sea blow of the war. They are
practically unanimous in the opinion,
however, that the destruction of the
ships will not lessen the effectiveness
of the British blockade. Some of the
editorials in part are:
The Times: It is clear that we have
suffered the heaviest blow at sea we
have met with during the war. We
engaged, perhaps with over confi
dence, in a long running fight with
ships which were more numerous,
stronger, more heavily armed than
our cruiser fleet and we suffered heav
ily. But the event will not impair
the effectiveness of our blockade or
our ability to uphold the freedom of
the sea.

LONDON, June 3.—British spirit is
undaunted and despite the loss of
such ships aa the Queen Mary and
Invincible, of which all England was
proud, together with a dozen other
war craft, the disaster of the North
sea battle is viewed philosophically
today.
Chief regret centers in the loss of
officers and men. The lost ships can
be replaced and at all events Briton's
sea superiority is still two to one

One of the chief reasons for the
heavy British losses iB found in the
fact pointed out by experts here that
German dreadnoughts—first line ves
sels of the kaiser's navy—were op-
cruisers until the English dread
noughts appeared.
In response to wireless calls and
hurried signals from torpedo boats
sent back to bring up aid to the as
sailed cruiser squadron, the great
first line ships of Britain swung for
ward to the scene of battle. When
they appeared, however, the Germans
fled and the British still maintain to
day that Germany ha® yet to feel the
full force of English sea power.
(Efficient Zeppelin scouting enabled
the Germans at all times to locate
approaching warships. Hovering
above the German high sea fleet as it
pounded the British cruisers and de

Beatty In Command.
JXXNDON, June 3.—Adapted Beatty
was in command of the first British,
squadron to clash with the Germans
in Wednesday's great battle.
It was learned at the admiralty
this afternoon that it was Beatty
who cut off the German battle cruis
ers from their ibase. According to
admiralty accounts, the battl^ had
four distinct phases. Tne first phase
was at 3:15 o'clock Wednesday aft
ernoon, when the German and Brit
ish battle cruisers first met. Admiral
Beatty was in command and immed
iately started his maneuver to cut
off the German fleet's line of retreat.
"Thus the four phases were com
prised of Admiral Safety's attempt to
cut off the Germans: second, his
forced retirement to the open sea by
the appearance of the German bat
tleships when the British were out
numbered for a time third, the ar
rival of the main British fleet under
Admiral Jelllcoe, when it became a
dreadnought against dreadnought,
and fourth, a retirement of the Gor
man forces in the face of the Brit
ish attack."
