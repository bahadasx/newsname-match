SERVICE IN LIFE
BRINGS THE BEST
RETURNSSAYSVANCE
Dean of University Law School Gives
Able Address to Graduating
Class.
HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF
27 AWARDED DIPLOMAS
Excellent Commencement Program is
Given Attorney Brown Explains
High School Work.
"The man or woman who serves as
best he can in the manner that is
open to him, and with the powers
that are given to him, is the man who
gets the best return that life af
fords."
The above statement was made in
the commencement address by Dean
William Reynolds Vance at the grad
uation exercises of the Bemidji high
school last evening.
Twenty-seven seniors yesterday
completed their high school course
and last evening at the Grand thea
ter were awarded diplomas.
Theater Decorated.
The theater was especially decor
ated for the occasion. The gradu
ates, members of the board of educa
tion and members of the high school
glee club were seated on an elevated
platform which had been erected on
the stage of the theater.
Attorney Montreville J. Brown,
president of the board of education,
in presenting the diplomas to the
graduates told of the purposes of a
high school education. He outlined
the practical advantages of a high
school education.
A music program was given under
the direction of Miss Francis Kenney,
music instructor.
Dean Vance in an able and impres
sive manner delivered the commence
ment address on "Investing a Life."
He told of the different investments
that could be made with a life and
told of the different values of life.
His address is as follows:
Important Incident.
To the man of insight, the man who
is capable of appreciating the great
forces and powerful influences that
are shaping the destinies of this
country, a school commencement is
one of the most significant incidents
of our school life. We are keenly in
terested in the work that proceeds in
legislative halls but it is of little
importance compared with the work
that proceeds in the schools of the
commonwealth. We take much in
terest in the elections that determine
who shall be the legislative and ex
ecutive officers of the commonwealth
but such an election is of trifling sig
nificance as compared with the com
mencement ceremonies which send
out into the work of the world young
men and women that have been right
ly trained for that work.
Like Conferring Knighthood.
I never see a company of youth
ful graduatesthe real soldiers of
civilization's armygoing forth to
do their part in the great battle of
life, but that I think of the beautiful
ceremonial that accompanied the con
ferring of knighthood in the days of
chivalry. The young squire who had
proved his virtue and his valor was
called before the high altar and there
took a solemn vow that he would
reverence God hold all women in
honor succor the weak and the op
pressed and ever bear himself as
befitted a true knight. Then the
king or other great lord who was
conferring knighthood, would give
youth a gleaming sword and burnish
ed shield. These new and untried
weapons the youth laid before the
altar, and then, on his knees, through
a whole night he watched his newly
acquired weapons and prayed God
to give him strength to acquit him
self like a true knight.
Must Succor Weak.
We do not have quite the same
ceremonial, and the weapons that
knights use in these days are not
sword and buckler, but not less truly
this ceremonial this evening means
that these young people who have
been trained in this high school, go
out into the long warfare that each
must wage, devoted to the great
cause of human sacrifice. They too
must hold God in reverence must
hold all women and men and little
children in honor. They must suc
cor the weak and oppressed, and bear
themselves as true men and women,
worthy of the teaching that they
have had.
This season is well called "com
mencement," for each one of these
young people here before us is now
ready to commence his independent
life. Whether they go on to the
untmrity in search of higher and
*^ant*!ng, or go immediately

out into the industries of life, they
henceforth must guide their own
steps and fashion their own destin
ies. Heretofore tlieir every stey has
been led and supported by the guid
ing hand of parent or teacher. But
now in every truth they must be the
architects of their own fortunes.
Each one has his own life. What is
he going to do with it? The reply
is easy and certain. He is going to
invest it in something.
Pity the Rich.
I don't know how many of you are
the children of millionaires. I dare
say each of you wishes that in his
home the lack of money was never
felt. But my first privilege is to con
gratulate you that such is not the
case that most of you, possibly all
of you, are now face to face with the
stimulating necessity of making a
living. I congratulate you that this
is indeed the commencement of your
responsible life, even though that re
sponsibility may weigh heavily upon
the minds of some of you. Andrew
Carnegie, on an occasion similar to
this, once said that the greatest good
fortune that had befallen him was to
escape the handicap of a rich father.
And canny Andy was right. In this
wonderful land of freedom and oppor
tunity, the sons of the rich are the
ones to be pitied. In the great
struggle for the real values of life,
they have scarcely a chance in com
petition with the sons of the poor.
Whatever be your financial condi
tion, at this hour marking the com
mencement of your responsible lives,
you are immensely rich in the real
values of life.
Values of Life.
Now what are these real values of
life? Perhaps you will answer, fine
clothes, automobiles, great houses
and country places. Perhaps others
of you may say, lands, stocks and
bonds, business success and money.
But there you are wrongquite
wrong. Those are but the incidents
of life, not its real values. Then
what are these real values? Fortu
nately we have the answer written
clearly in a wonderful document, one
that is sometimes sneered at by the
ignorant and the shallow-brained,
but which embodies more than any
other single human document, the ac
cumulated social wisdom of the ages
the Constitution of the United
States. That document was drawn
partly for the purpose of guarantee
ing to citizens of the republic, against
aggression by president, congress or
court, the possession of those funda
mental rights without which a free-

man could not live content. This
guaranty of the real values of life
was that no person should be de
prived of "life, liberty or property,"
without due process of law. These
are the real values of life, standing
out in the history of civilization in
words that gleam like an electric
light sign against the sky. "Life,"
the God-given principle without
which naught else is possible "lib-
erty," without which the possibili
ties of life cannot be realized
"property," without which the home,
the dearest of all human institutions,
is impossible, and without which lib
erty must sooner or later yield to the!
tyranny of hunger. i
Life is First.
Mark the order in which these I
great values are named first is the'
greatest of all, life itself next is
liberty and last and least is prop-!
erty. Of these three great values ofi
life every one of you has the two first
and most important. Everyone of i
you has life and liberty. What are
you going to do with them? That
is the great question, too great to an
swer in a brief half hour. Let us!
abbreviate it and ask, What are you
going to do with your life? You!
have got to invest it, but how?
Have you come yet to realize how
hard it is to invest money wisely?
The inexperienced investor is beset
on every side with perils of loss, i
Wherever he turns he is urged to
invest his funds in bonds that have
no security in stock that has no value,
in unseen town lots in distant cities,
in orange groves in Florida and apple I
orchards in Washington. If' un
usually foolish he may be tempted to
invest his money on the throw of!
dice or the turn of a card. On every
hand stand those who are ready to
rob him of his money without real
return and innocence and helpless
ness afford no protection against such
loss. Only to the wise and prudent,
is there safety and a sure dividend.
Like an Investment.
In many respects the investment
of a life is like the investment of a
savings fund. But it differs in some
respects first, that the tragedy con
sequent upon an unwise investment
of life is infinitely greater than thai
which follows a bad investment of
money secondly, every one must
make an investment of his life ir
something, while many people are
never called upon to invest funds:
and lastly and most solemn of r.ll,
no one has more than one life to in
vest. He may learn wisdom froivi a

FOURTEENSHIPSSUNK
BY GERMAN FLEET
INBIGVAVALFIGHT
London, June 3.When the battle
ended Thursday between the English
and German fleets, Great Britain had
lost the battle cruisers Queen Mary,
Indefatigeable and Invincible, the
cruisers Defense, Black Prince and
Warrior and eight torpedo boat de
stroyers, while the German battle
ship Pommern had been sent to the
bottom by a torpedo, and the cruiser
Weisbaden sunk by British gunfire.
In additlcm several German torpedo
craft were missing, and the small
cruiser Frauenlob had last been seen
badly listed and was believed to hare
gone to the bottom.
One Zeppelin Hit.
Amsterdam, June 3.Of the six
Zeppelins participating in the naval
fight, one is reported damaged.
New York, June 3.The latest
German version of the naval fight
claims that the battleship Warsprite
was not damaged. One of the most
striking features of the battle was
that the German battleship West
Fallen alone sank six British tor
pedo boats. It is also claimed that
only a part of the German fleet was
in the actual fight.
German Boats Take Refuge.
London, June 3.Reports state
that eight German warships took
refuge in Danish waters, which were
ordered to leave by noon today or in
tern. The superdreadnaught Hinden
berg is reported sunk. It was the
latest word in German naval con
struction and completed since the
war.
Although it was England's heavi
est naval loss, the effectiveness of
its fleet will not be felt. The chief?
regret is the loss of officers and men.
It still maintains that its sea super-,
iority* is two to one over Germany,
because only its light dreadnaugfctsE
opposed the big German ships until*
the big dreadnaughts of the English?
fleet appeared. Vice Admiral Scheer
commanded the German fleet.
