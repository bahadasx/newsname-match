FIRE BOYS TO PRESS
SUTO TRUCK CLAIM
Appropriation for Improvement to
Company Expected to Be M}ilde
CITY COUNCIL THOUGHC TO
BE FAVORING TRUCK
Modern FireFighting Apparatus
Will Be Asked Administration on
Next Tuesday. Night
The automobile fire truck ques
fi tion will probably be re-opened at
the Tuesday meeting of the city
council. A delegation of firemen
will storm the city hall to besiege
the adminisration to make the nec
essary appropriation for the pur
chasing of the much-needed auto
truck.
Several months ago the question
was broached at a meeting of the
old council; but it was the opinion
of the members to defer action un
til the new administration would
take charge of the city's affairs.
It is understood that three mem
k bers of the council have already
· expressed themselves as favoring
'the appropriation and if these three
: should decide to vote in favor of
the measure the Opelousas Volun
' teer Company would secure the
'modern fighting machine that it has
i long wanted.
The movement was promised sup
port by Mayor Loeb, who sometime
ago, stated that he would favor the
appropriation at the first meeting
in June.
With assurances of Aldermen
Danel, Stelly and Hollier the fire
boys feel confident of carrying the
..day at the approaching regular
meeting of the council. It is very
pfobable that the other two mem
bers, Messsrs. Field and Gosselin,
:,who have not expressed themselves
on the proposition either one way or
Sthe other, will favor the appropria
tion, when the subject comes up for
disposal.
Opelousas is in need of the auto
fire truck; disastrous fires may vis-'

At any rate Opelousas should

PRIMARY BILL WILL
FORCE PARTY PLEDGES
ADMINISTRATION MEASURE COM PELS ALL PARTIES TO HOLD
PRIMARIES ON THE SAME DAY
DEFINES PARTY
The administration bill has been
drawn up and a fight for its passage
in both houses will be started in
earnest. The bill deals rather se
verely with t'Sose who bolted the
democratic party during the recent
gubernatorial campaign; it would
make party bolting a misdemeanor.
The bill provides for compulsory
primaries and a pledge to support
the nominees of the primary. Sep
arate commissioners and ballot
boxes are provided for. All pri
maries must be held on the same
day.
A party is defined as a political
organization having received. ten
per cent of the votes in the last
general election.
Party nominees who turn to the
support of another party will be
ejected from nomination. Trial
shall be on petition of twenty-five
electors and shall be by the party
committee whose decision shall be
final.
Party committees likewise may
purge their roll of any member who
gave aid, comfort, assistance or sup
port all the nominees in the ensu
ing election."
Nominees removed are to be re
placed by the party committee.
Committeemei are to be likewise
replaced.
The following is the pledge to be
printed on the ballot:
"By casting this ballot, I pledge
myself to abide by the result of
this primary election and to air and
support all the nominees thereof in
the ensuing general election."

COTTON MEN PREDICTING
LARGE CROP FOR PARISH
ProsTieets for Bumper Crops- Have
Never BH~in Better in the
History of St, Landry
The outlook of the cotton crop is
so bright at present, that cotton
men are predicting that St. Lan
dry will produce a bumper crop
this Fall.
Throughout the parish the stand
is reported as being good; working
condition is ideal and the stock
that brings forth the fancy price
and valuable staple is improving
daily.
Weather condition permitting St.
Landry will produce the largest
cotton crop, since the division of
the parish, and in fact since the ar
rival of the boll weevils nine years
ago.
The cane crop is by no means
second to any other, cane growers
reporting that a bumper yield will
be realized. As this crop is expect
ed to bring a fancy price this win
ter the cane growers are compli
menting themselves on having in
creased their acreage.
The corn and rice crops are as
good as during the best years; as a
matter of fact some of the oldest
corn growers in this parish claim
that St. Landry will double its usu
al corn output. As several large
rice planters have installed pump
ing outfits and have drilled deep
wells the rice crop, it is believed,
will be larger than any previous
year.
Taken as a whole the.crop condi
tions*in St. Landry are ideal; pros
pects for bumper crops have never
been better and if the farmers do
not get any severe setback during
the coming summer months it is
very probable that they will place
on the markets the largest crops
ever produced in the history of this
parish.

GARLAND DUPRE
Under a Washington, D. C. news
note head the following account of
an entertainment tendered friends
by Hon. H. Garland Dupre is found:
Representative Garland Dupre en

honor of Mrs. Thomas E. Mount, of

Mrs. Laurent Dupre, his sister, Miss
Edith Dupre, both of Opelousas;

Representative and Mrs. L. Morgan,
of Covington; Representative and
Mrs. Riley Joseph Wilson, of Har

considered a spoiled ballot. The
measure proposes to punish as a
misdemeanor the following:
"That any voter who participates
in the primary election of the po
litical party is prohibited from, di
rectly or indirectly, aiding or as
sisting in the election of any person
in opposition to any candidate nom
inated in the primary in which he
took part; that he is prohibited
from serving on any committee, al
lowing the use of his name, pub
licly or privately advocating the
election of any one in opposition to
any candidate nominated in the
primary in which he took part; that
any voter in the primary is pro
hibited from contributing money
toward the election of any one in
opposition to the candidates nomi
nated in any primary in which he
took part; that any persons violat
ing the provisions of this section
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,
and, upon conviction thereof, shall
be punished as provided for in the
act; and that, in the event of any
prosecution under the act the poll
list showing the vote of the pri
mary shalt be prima facie evidence
that he voted in the same."
It is made the .duty of all the
clerks of court to preserve all poll
lists delivered to them for four
years after each election. It is de
fined that any one convicted of mis
demeanor under the act would be
fined not less than $50 nor more
than $500, and be imprisoned for
not less than two monhs or more
than, one year, and not be eligible
to hold office for four years.
LOUISIANA BANKERS WILL
ENCOURAGE CATTLE RAISERS
Capitalists Will Assist Stock Men
If State Tick Bill Is Adopted
and Tick Eradicated
The bankers of Louisiana, says
the New Orleans Times-Picayune,
will encourage and back the cat
tle industry if the tick is eradicated.
So says Dr. R. O. Young, chair
man of the agricultural committee
of Louisiana bankers, which has de
voted much effort to awakening
both the farmers and the bankers to
their opportunity and their duty
and has aided mightily in co-oper
ation and advance. He has been
discussing and favoring the state
tick measure now before the state
legislature.
"I saw interviews from a num
ber of sheriffs in our state in The
Times-Picayune commenting upon
the bill now before the legislature
for the eradication of the tick in
Louisiana. Some of these inter
views would lead one to believe that
there is considerable opposition to
such legislation," commented Dr.
Young.
"If Louisiana ever expects to
rank as one of the cattle producing
states of our Union, thereby making
it one of our greatest agricultural
states, some drastic means must be
taken to rid ourselves of that great
hindrance to profitable stock rais
ing, the cattle tick.
"The tick reduces the price of
cattle, prevents shipments of stock
to good markets and prevents
bringing in good stock for breed
ing purposes, thereby eliminating
the possibilities of building up the
dairying and beef business in
Louisiana and costing this state
hundreds of thousands of dollars
in money spent in other states for
dairy products, besides the great
financial loss incurred in the death
of cattle-a menace which hangs
over the heads of stockmen, pre
venting the importation of high
priced graded cattle.
"To be prosperous Louisiana
must have live stock, and to raise
live stock the tick must be eradi
cated. The eradication of the tick
in Louisiana must be carried out
with great care and with this done
Louisiana cattle can then be placed
on the markets at profitable prices.
Deprive any commodity, growing or
manufacturing, from the best mar
kets of the world and the result
will be failure. This is why Louis
iana is yet in the unproven field of
profitable cattle raising, for its in
fected conditions restricts its
markets.

this office, however, will not become
vacant until the first of the year.
Sheriff Swords, Co ner Littell and
Clerk Lastrapes will be found filling
their, same offices.
The new police jury, which is
composed of eight new and eight
old members, will take hold of the
parochial reins on next Monday
when they will permanently organ

The report has been most excel

tone photographs of the oil and
gas wells of the state, the salt mines,
the fisheries and oyster industries,
the fur-bearing animal industry,
and many exceptional photographs
of the wild and animal life taken
in their hattits.
President Alexander has so ar
ranged his report that each of the
various departments of the com
mission are represented by re

heads; each report showing that
the commission has lived up to its
duties by not only guarding the
natural resources of the state but
by upbuilding them for the profit
of the people of Louisiana.

JENKINS DUPLICATES HIS
WONDERFUL PERFORMANCES
St. Landry Boy Has No Difficulty in
Carrying Off Honors in Dashes
at New Orleans Track Meet
Dana Jenkins, the idol of South
ern track fans, reputed to be the
most wonderful and at the same
ime the best track athlete ever
produced in Dixieland, had no dif
iculty in defeating other South
ern champions in the 100, 200 and
440 yard dashes, at the S. A. A. U.
meet held in New Orleans last Sat..
urday.
Jenkins not only broke the South
ern records for he 220 and 440 yard
dashes, but came within one-fifth
of a second of equaling the world's
record. He made splendid tirue in
the 100 yard run, but on ao'tunt of
time-keepers disagreeing he was
not allowed the record that be
really made.
Track experts clawir that Jen
kins will easily break the world's
record for the 220 yard das'., when
ever he meets with a runner that
will keep right behind nimn. In the
New Orleans meet he cro<cd the
tape so far ahead of the next fellow
that he could stop awhile and saile
behind at his opponents. Had he
been pushed it is believed that
Jenkins would have lower ed the
world's record by at least a cup!c
of seconds.
Jenkins will lead the Southern
Athletic team, which will repre
sent Dixie colleges and universi
ties at the national A. A. U. meet in
Newark, N. J., in September. The
St. Landry boy will then have the
opportunity of his life of showing
exactly what he can accomplish on
the track. Southern track experts
are confident that Jenkins will be
the winner in the 220 and 440 yard
dashes, while he has a splendid
chance of kopping the 100 yard
run. Should Jenkins win out in
these three events he will come
very close to winning the title of
the greatest athlete in the world.
Tad Gormley, the South's great
est track director, is leaving noth
ing undone to make Jenkins the
greatest track man in the world; he
believes he will succeed, because
the St. Landry boy is always will
ing to do anything that his direc
tors tell him to. Between now and
September it is expected that Jen
kins will improve wonderfully and
it would not be surprising to see
him lower at least two world's
record at the Newark meet.

from This State to Convention
Political rumors -have it tha
John W. Lewis,- of Opelousas, re
cently chosen by the. state demo
cratic convention, as on of the dele
gates from the seventh congression
al district, will be chairman of the.
Louisiana delegation to the St.
Louis national democratic conven
tion, which will begin on June the
14th.
Friends of Mr. Lewis have
launched a pussy-foot ' campaign
with an endeavor to secure him this
honorary position. It would indeed
be an honor to be head of the Lou

for a young man like 4r, Lewis, as
the delegates chosen to represent
this state at the national conven
tion are numbered among the lead
ing and most influential citizens of

It is understood that the Opelou
sas man will be tendered the honor,
by the delegates by acclamation.
St. Landry has been honored
many times by democracy; two
weeks ago two of ,her most prom
inent young attorneys were chosen
by the state convention, one as del

Should Mr. Lewis be tendered the
