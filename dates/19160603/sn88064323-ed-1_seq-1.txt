WHY PRIGES MUST
GO HIGHER.
England, in time« of pouce, ex
porte ooal to Sweden and balances
the account by importing Swedish
palp. But with the outbreak of
the great war the British Empire
needed all her fuel supply to oper.
ate her inanition plants and war
ships.
Sweden, in retaliation, has re
fused to ship palp to Great Brit
aln, and, owing to her shortage of
o >al and the dangers and diffiottl
tie« of ocean tiattic, she is now
«hipping very little pulp to the
United States.
South America, Central Ameri
ca, Australia, India, Africa and
many of the European conntries,
fiudiug their usual sources of sup
pljr closed to them, clamor to the
United States for relief and find
that oar stock of raw materials is
so nearly exhausted that we can
scarcely produce enough paper to
meet the requirements of oar own
people.
The god of war has not only ap
propriated the wood pulp and cot
ton essential to the manufacture
of paper but he has also claimed
for bis destructive purposes the
bulk of available chemicals of
scarcely less importance.
Bleached sulphite (wood fibre)
that formerly sold for #2 65 per
cwt., now commands as high as
$5 00 per cwt. Bleaching pow
dera that commonly sell for little
more than a cent a pound are ob
tainable even at 13 cents. Soda
Ash, Rosin, Satin White, Casein
and Atom have doubled and treb
led in price. Auiline Colors that
the paper manufacturer common
ly buys for forty cents per pound
are now difficult to obtain even at
$20.00 per pound.
Every article that enters Into
the production of paper has ad
vaooed in pries and is still bound
to advance to even higher prices
Labor, now feeling the stimulas of
war orders, commands more than
the same grade of labor could
oommand before the war.
There is no immediate possibili
ty of a speedy retard to normal
priées. With the curtailment of
production of raw materials and
the artificial demand for cellulose
for the production of high explo
sivea, paper must oontione to ad
vanee in cost. Even the oonttnn
atioo of hostilities could not re
store normal conditions until Biifll
oient time had elapsed to permit
Industry to return to healthy con
ditions and to allow for the manu
facture of enormoas atocks.
To the printer thia all means
the argent necessity of advancing
his prices in proportion to the
general advances in the market.
Paper already purchased and held
in «took should be valued at to
day's prices because it esnnot be
replaced for less.—Paragraphs.
Take HERBINE for all disturban
ce« in the bowels. It purifies the
bowel channels, promotes regular
movements ana makes you feel
bright, vigorous and cheerful.

HOWTO CHOOSE A WIFE.
If your income le limited, don't
ohoooe e wife who le elways want
ing to bo taken about to expensive
pleoes of emusement, or one who
isooustantly demending presents
end finding excuses for you to
spend more money then you can
afford, is the advise Irene Watson
gives young men Such e woman
«rill never be oontent with what
you provide her with. Merry her
and you will live to find that
shortness of money will not be
your share in life, but It will lead
te more trouble than anything
else, for muudane «• it may seem,
there are more marriages brought
to turn through fioeuoiel troubles
than any other.
Don't marry a women who af
feota to deapiae domesticity and
who boasts of having e mind that
is superior to the affaire of the
kitchen and the nnreery. She
May be smart, bat she is pretty
oertein not to ran well in double
bernese. Ear better leave such a
woman to enjoy her intellectual
pursuits, and ebooee instead a
girl who is not ashamed to con
!sm that ehe made a dreae you ad
nire, that she cooks her father's
dinner end manages the house
keeping aliowanoe.
Bat on the other bend, don't
ran away with the silly Idee that
beoeuee a girUhas to work to
keep hereelT that she will make e
bad wife.
It is by no mean« the girl who
has been sheltered at home, ear
rounded by comforts, that make«
the beat wife. Yon will find that
it is very often the one who has
fought life's herd battles end bad
•ome experience of the bneineas
ktmoepbere that enrronnda her
knsband who is beet able to un
deretand and helps him.—Time*
