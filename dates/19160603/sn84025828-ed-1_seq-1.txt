PREPARE FOR WAR
Oifford Pinchot Writes to The Eagle on
the Subject of Preparedness and
Tells of Conditions.
Opposed to Extremists but Believes in a Common

Attract the Attention of the Voters of Illinois.
The following article sent to the
Editor of tho Chicago Eagle by Glf
ford Pinchot, the well-known publicist,
Is timely and Interesting:
QIFFORD PINCHOT:
Mllford, Pike Co., Pa.
Muy 28, 1010.
Henry F. Donovan
Editor, The Eagle,
Chicago, 111.
My dear Mr. Donovan:
Recently I had occasion to "write
you about the conservation of water
power. Now I have In mind another
matter of the first Importance. It Is
the question of national defense.
There has been so much loose talk
on both sides of this question that I
have been Impelled to set down some
of the essential considerations, as I
understand them. The resulting
abort article Is enclosed with the re
quest that you will do me the favor
to read it, and after that use It or
throw It away, as you think best.
Very sincerely yours,
QIFFORD PINCHOT.
PREPAREDNESS AND COMMON
SENSE.
y Qlfford Pinchot.
Along with thousands of our citi
zens, I am deeply Interested In the
question of national defense. Like
them, I am anxious to know the facts
und to use whatever common sense I
have In reaching a wise conclusion as
to what we ought to do for our own
protection. I am not stampeded, arid
I do not propose to be, but I.do want
the United States to take what pre
cautions are reasonable In view of the
facts. The situation looks to me like
this:
Certain pacifists assure us that pre
paredness is useles because there is
no danger of war. Do they know, or
are they merely asking us to accept
their guess in a matter which vitally
concerns the safety and welfare of
the nation, T Millions of pacifists In
tho past have given the same assur
ance, and have been mistaken, Wars
havo come in spite of them. England
was full of people who affirmed that
the present war was Impossible up
to the very moment of its breaking
out, and who opposed with all their
might any Increase in armament until
war actually began.
The United States has already had
five wa'rs, each one of which was un
desired and unexpected by great num
bers of our people. For a year past
our state department has been occu
pied with questions which might lead
to war, What It our present pacifists
should in their turn prove to be
wrong, and wars should come and And
us unprepared? It is, a serious chance
for any nation, this gamble on their
opinion, which the pacifists are ask
ing us to take, , ,
Preparedness is Insurance against
war, It is not militarism, And must
not bo j confused with )t. Militarism
is making ready for aggressive war.
Any one, ."who believes that the people
of tho United States can ,be driven or

dragged into aggressive militarism
must have forgotten the whole trend
of our history, and In particular our
recent voluntary retirement from
Cuba.
""Tr'WntJnsoiiBe to saVlhat'our peo-
pie will plunge into militarism because
they prepare themselves in order to
dlscourago aggression. On that the
ory, no citizen should be allowed to
own a gun, becauso guns can be used
to kill peoplo, or to Insure his house,
lest Insurance should bring on a fire.
Here and there an extremist will
make excessive and ridiculous propo
sals for preparednes or against It.
Such proposals should not be permit
ted to upset our judgmont. They lead
nowhere. We waste our time discuss
ing them. For us the extremes of
militarism and of non-reslstanco are
equally out of the question. In sober
fact, our final cholco will He not be
tween any fantastic extremes, but be
tween resonablo national defense and
an imitation of it that will fall In
the day of trial between moderate
genuine preparedness and a sham.
Wo may prepare too little, but there
1b no danger whatever that this coun
try will rush to tho other extreme.
(The pacifists assure us that such
military training as the Swiss people
are giving themselves endangers de
mocracy, and that our young men will
be hurt by learning to obey. But
neither democracy nor personal in
dependence have been Injured in
Switzerland, which Is the most demo
cratic country of Europe. Universal
military service in New Zealand and
Australia goes hand-In hand with the
most thorough-going labor-controlled
democracy on earth, "t
France, .whose military training 'Is
far more thorough ttianloufa 'will ever
be, Is the llylpgprppf that'an,.antiy
can be a groat den'rocratUf institution,
and that citizens tralnod to arms may
possess tho highest personal Initiative
and intelligence. Germany cannot be
offered as an example of what mili
tary training does to democracy, be
cause Germany nevor has boen demo
cratic. ,
But even if all this were not triie,
It would still bo ldlo to make a bogey
of universal military Vorvlce, because
even those who believe In It most
heartily understand that It has not
the slightest chance of being adopted.
No national leader In any political
party Is asking for Its adoption. It
Is not an Issuo, und nothing less than
tho pressure of actual invasion could
make it an issuo In the United States.
The American people havo a way of
reaching common sense decisions
after long and often bitter discussion.
There Is hope that this Is about to
happon In the present case, The rea
sonable advocates of natlonnl-dofenso
and the reasonable .pacifists, seem to
be on the vergo of a reasonable agree
ment of vlows. For example, the pa
pers of April 23 ' report that Henry
Ford said, In an Interview given In
New York: "I believe In reasonablo
preparedness," and "I wouldn't object
to an army of say 250,000 men." Less
than a week boforo this statement of
Ford's, I asked Colonel Roosevolt
what he would consider reasonable
preparedness. He replied: "The sec
ond navy if tho world and an ttrmy
of25fl,ttl0'men." '
In this case, pacifist and advocato
of prepa'rednoss uro In agreement as
to the size of a reasonable army. An
army of 250,000 men means one sol
dlor to about 430 people. Thero Is
one policeman for every 416 people In
Philadelphia, and one to every 429
people In New York. To ra at least
an army of that proportionate size
carries with it no threat that militar
ism Is about to overwhelm democracy.
As to tho navy, from 1905 to 1909
our navy was the second in the world.
Having it second did not endanger
democracy then. I see no reason why
It should endanger democracy now.
So far as I am aware no one famil
iar with naval affairs believes that

In tho editorial the Tribune says:
"Six Superior court Judges aro to uo

tho candidates havo been selected by
the Republican and Democratic county
committees, sitting as conventions as

"The Democrats havo renominated

Devor. The only retiring Judgo Is Rob

inated. "Public policy will suggest to tho
voters that thoy re-elect tho sitting
judges. When a judgo has proved his
right intent upon tho bench and has
expressed his Intent In cood service,
his experience Is not to bo thrown
away merely becauso another man
asks for his place. Good judicial serv
ice is not obtained In that fashion.
Continuous service obtained by tho

Thero aro over 55,000 lawyers In

The colleges and law schools of tho
stato turn out between 4,000 and 5,000
new lawyers every year so that tho
number of barristers is constantly in

That thero are several good lawyers

Why 1,400 mon should decide upon
Judicial timber for 600,000 voters Is
something too hard to guess.
Tho lawyers who patronize tho free
