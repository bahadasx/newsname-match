GERMAN FLEET DEFEATS ENGLISH FLEET
IN GREATEST NAVAL BATTLE IN HISTORY
' British Lose Three Battleships, Three
Cruisers and Several Destroyers
GERMANS REPORT LOSS OF TWO CRUISERS
Engagement Occurs in North Sea Off
Jutland Coast. Accounts Meager
LONDON, June 2. (7:45 p. m.) A'tiT rumors had been flying
about all day that a naval battlo had occurred in t ho North
ca, the British public was given news by the admiralty this evening
that will send a painful shock throughout the country.
According to the admiralty announcement, in an engagement
ff Jutland on Wednesday afternoon the Hritish battle cruiser fleet
met a German fleet with the result that three British battle cruisers
were sunk, together with three cruisers and several destroyers while
six destroyers were still unaccounted for.
The battle seems to have lasted through the afternoon and the
following night. The German fleet's losses are stated to have been
.ierious, but no very definite information of these losses is afforded
by the admiralty announcement. One battle cruiser is declared to
have been destroyed and another severely damaged while the belief
is expressed that a large number of German destroyers were dis
posed of. The news was flashed out in special editions of the
evening newspapers and caused greater consternation in the west
end of London than had been witnessed on any previous occasion
since the declaration of war. The frankness of the admiralty an
nouncement concerning the serious nature of the British losses and
the apparently small losses of the Germans in comparison led to
tin; assumption in most minds that the British vessels must have
been led into a mine field.
Following quickly upon the admiralty announcement came the
German official version of the fight which in general confirms the
British account, but carries the claim that the British battleship
Warspite also was sunk and other British battleships damaged.
The German losses, according to the German version of the bat
tle, were the small cruiser Wiesbaden, sunk by gun fire, and the
warship Poinmern, sunk by a torpedo while the cruiser Frauenlob
and a number of torpedo boats are missing.
Germans Claim Victory.
RF.RLIN, Juno 2. ( lly wireless to'
Sayvllle) The German admiralty an
nounced today that the German high
sea fleet on May 31 had encountered a
Hritish fighting fleet. The encase
ment which developed, the admiralty
says, was favorable to the (iermuns.
The battle continued all night.
The German admiralty tnnounces
that the lame Hritish battleship War
.iprito, the battle cruisers tjueen .Mary
and Indefatigablo and two armored
cruisers weie destroyed.
It is nlso reported that a small
Hritish cruiser, a number of torpedo
destroyers and torpedo boats were
iunk.
Tho German admiralty statement
adds that, by observation, it was
established that a large number of
Hritish battleships suffered damage
from the fire of the German big ships
and the attacks of the torpedo bout
fleet.
Rescue Cre.
The admiralty statement also de
clares that tho Hritish battleship
Marlborough was hit by a torpedo,
this being confirmed by the prisoners
rescued. Several of tho German ships
rescued imrts of the crews of the
Hritish ships which were sunk, they
including, it is said, (wo men from
the Indefatigable, the only survivors
of that ship.
On the German side, the small
cruiser Wiesbaden was sunk by sun-
fire and the Pnmmorn was sent to
iho bottom bv A tornodo. l'he late of
tho Frauenlob is not known and some
torpedo boats did not return. i ne
,-inrmnn biir sea fleet, the statement
adds, returned to port June 1.
Fought Knlire Night.
Tho German admiralty report.
which Is dated June 1, says: "During
tho enterprise directed to the north
ward, our high sea fleet on May 31
encountered the main part of the
English fighting fleet, which was con
siderably superior to our forces.
"During the afternoon, between
Skagerak and Horn Kiff. a heavy en
gagement developed which was suc
cessful for us and which continued
durin the whole night.
"In this engagement, so far as
known up to the present, there were
destroved hy us the large nauiesnip
Warsprite, the battle cruisers Queen
Mary and Indefatigable, two armored
cruisers, apparently of the Achilles
type, one small cruiser, a new flag
ship of destroyers, the Tuhanant,
Nestore and Alcaster, a large number
of torpedo boat destroyers and one
submarine.
Other Ships Damaged.
"Fty observation which was free
and clear of objects, it was stated that
a large number of English battleships
suffered damage from our ships and
the attacks of our torpedo boat flo
tilla during the day engagement and
throughout the night.
"Among others tho largo battleship
Marlhorough was hit by a torpedo.
This wasconfirnmed by prisoners.
"Several of our ships rescued parts
of the crews of the sunken English
ships, anong them being two and the
only survivors of the Indefatigable.
"On our side the small cruiser
Wiesbaden, by hostile gun fire during
the day engagement and his majesty's
ship l'omiuern, during the night, as
the result of a torpedo, wercunk.
"The fate of his majesty's ship
Frauenlob, which Is missing and of
some torpedo boats, which have not
returned yet, is unknown.
"The high sea fleet reutrned today
(Thursday) Into our port."
tiTOSC Anflll.
The losses in the engagement must
have ben extremely heavy. The battle
cruiser Indefatigable, for instanoe,
from which the German admiralty
reports only two men were saved,
probably had more than nine hundred
men on board and others of the ves
sels sunk carried complements of men
equally or nearly as large.
I'rior to this battle Great Britain
had lost during the course of the
war ten battleships, 11 cruisers and
various smaller craft. Germany had
lost 18 cruisers, 19 auxiliary cruisers,
chiefly converted passenger liners,
and numerous smaller vessels.
Hat tie i:.Mctcd.
Slnco the beginning of the war,
Hritish cruisers and destroyers have
putroled day and night the ap
proaches to the Germnn fleet's base
in the bay formel by the mouths oi
the Kibe and the Weser. protected by
the mighty fortifications of Wllhelm
shaven on the south, on the north by
tho supposedly impregnable defenses
of the Kiel canal and guarded bv the
outlying Island of Helgoland. Until
tho engagement that has just oc
curred, however, no German fleet nas
put forth In force to necessitate the
giving of the alarm to the Hritish
main fleet that its foe was coming
out to give battlo.
DisfYHi-rril Rondcvous.
Tho rendezvous of the Hritish bat
tle fleet has been a secret, but is gen
erally believed to have been in thv
Orkney islands, north of Scotland.
The long months of watchful wait
ing by the Hritish, however, were
broken Into by two naval engage
ments in which comparatively small
squadrons of German warships were
involved, and in both of which the
Hritish were victorious. One was on
August 2X, 1H14, and the other on
January 24, K'lfi.
The Invincible was laid down In
1907. She displaced 17,250 tons and
her normal complement was 731. She
carried a main battery of eight 12
inch guns.
The Defence was built in 1 y 07, dis
placed 14.1100 tons and ordinarily 13
5-inch guns
The Indefatigable was 578 feet long
and was equpped with eight li-inch
guns. Itoth carried complements of
between 900 and 950. The Queen
Mary cost about $10,000,000, while
the Indetutigable cost nearly $1,000,
000. Illlilt III ID) I.
The British dreadnaught Marlbor
ough was buill at Devonport in 114,
displaced 25,000 tons, was 620 feet
long and carried ten 13 B-tnch guns,
12 6-inch guns snd a number ot
smaller guns.
German losses.
The German battle cruisers Derf
flinger and Lutzow, one of which the
Hritish officials announced tonight
was blown up. are vessels of the
same class. Kach ship displaces 20,
600 tons, is 689 feet long. 95 feet
beam with a draught of 2 7 1-2 feet.
The Derfflinger was completed In
July, 1914, and the Lutzow a year
later. The ships carried eight 12
lnch guns, 12 6-Inch guns and 12 24
pounders. They were also equipped
with four torpedo tubes each.
The Dcrff linger once before was re
ported by the Hritish to have been
sunk when she participated in an
engagement in the North se. on Jan.
2 4. 1915. Aa year later report said
that she had been badly damaged
in the fight and was drydocked at
Hamburg for repairs.
The German cruiser Wiesbaden,

nouncement as having been sunk, is

WASHINGTON. June 2. Despite
the threatening tone of General
Carranza's last note, his military
forces In Chihuahua state are being
disposed in general accord with the
plan disclosed bv General obregon
during his conference at Kl I'aso with
t!i nert'ls Scott and Funstoii. This
was shown today when General Fun
ston sent word that the twenty thou
sand Carranza soldiers mobilized
within the last few days at Chihuahua
City had been spread over the region
not controlled by General I'crshing's
column in a way to carry out an ao
tie pursuit of bandits.
Secretary Haker said that General
Obregon had promised to send a large
number of men in pursuit of the ban
dits and all war department advices
Indicated that this plan was being
carried out. He added that he now
knew of nothing (o prevent the send
ing of new expeditions into Mexico
after raiders, provided a hot trail was
followed. Otherwise he declined to
discuss statements In the Carranza
note particularly those portions that
contend that General Scott promised
that no more troops would be sent
Into Mexico. Mr. Haker holds that
nny discussion of the note is not n
war department matter. He has al
ready placed in the hands of Secre
tary Lansing a complete written re
port of the conference, prepared by
General Hcott.

Army officers who studied the
Mexican troop dispositions us report
ed by General Kunston said they ap

to police the country and did not In
dicate the preparation of an unfriend
ly demonstration toward General
I'crshing's force. The Mexicans have
been for the most part distributed
In small commands to police definite
sections. No large force is being held
in ono place and the reports added
that no entrenchment or entangle
ments had been constructed. So far
there has been nothing to show that
military preparations for an attempt
to drive out the Americans have been
set In motion. On the other hand, re
liable information has been received
in official quarters that all of Car
ranza's advisers stand solidly behind
him In the expressions of his note.
Nothing has come to indicate the tem
per of the people, either In Mexico

There were no Indications today
that the state department was pre

demand for withdrawal or fi r a defi

United States toward Mexico.

CHICAGO, June 2. There wero
numerous conferences between
party leaders tod;u but so far as
could bo learned no agreement on
candidates was reached and there
was no development that accurately
indicates which candldale is likely to
be nominated for president by the He.
publican national convention. To

ton I t as over.
While on tho surface tho fight ap

In activity at the headquarters of the
various "favorite son" candidates.
Managers of the Root, Weeks, Hur

insisted that their candidates would
remain In tho fight until tho end.
After tabulating tho vole claimed for
Roosevelt they expressed the opinion
that the successful candidate either
would be one of the "favorite sons"
or a dark horse. The plan of the old
organization leaders is said to be to
try ami will, fiist with Root, and
if they fall In this effort, to give Hur
ton. Weeks, Fairbanks and Sherman
a tryout In the convention in the
order named. In the event of falling
to put over any of theso the plan Is
to propose a dark horse, uccordmg to
reports in circulation. Senator War
