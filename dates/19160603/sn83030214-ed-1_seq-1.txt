Waahington. Juna 2. Reports of the

aroused the greatest interest here, not

tha German fleet ha.l demonstrated a

"The Germans, flghting near home,
were able to us. their Zeppelin. to
great advantage as .eouta and to direet
the movementa of the warships. Then,
too, fear of mme fields may have em
harrassed the British. It seems certain,
that BBiOSa the British battle-cruiaers
were sunk by mmes, the (iermar..-4 must
have had a supenor dreadnought force
in the engagement. lt is almost incon
ceivable that the great Bri'.^h battle
cruisers were sunk by any other craft
than dreadnoughts.
"In thet ca.ae, the apparent fact tha*
the British dreadnough'.a escaped must
h> nterpreted aa mdaa'ing that the
tierman fleet fled the ba'tle, perhaps in
the fear that they were ,n the presenca
of the main British fleet. If the Brit?
ish pursued, the battle cruisers may'
have been sunk by mines or by the,

Ijondon. June 2.?Picking its way from Ita haee'in ti e Kicl
C'anal. the German high sea fleet on Wednesday ftftrTttOOal
emerged into the Xorth Sea and off the coast of Jutlan.l en
gaged a British fleet throughout the afternoon and night in
what probably was the greatest naval battle in the world'* his?
tory so far as tonnage engaged and tonnage destroyed was riJt>
rerned.
When the battle ended:
Great Britain had lost the battle-cruisers Queen Marv, ln
defatigable and Invincible, the cruisers Defence, Black Prince
and Warrior and eight torpedo boat destroyers. while ihe Ge
man battleahip Pommern had been sent to the bottom by a to?
pedo and the cruiser Wiesbaden sunk by the British gunftrt.
ln addition several German torpedo craft were mifl&ing and
? he small cruiser F'rauenlob had last been seen badlv li.-ted and
was believed to have gone to the bottom. These losses have
all been admitted by Great Britain and Germany.
llaim German Dreadnought Sunk.
Aside from Great Britain's conceded losses German) claima
that the British battleship Warspite, sister ship of th?- Queefl
Klizabeth and one of the largest and most powerful ships afloat,
had been sunk; that the battleship Marlborough. a vessel of
26,000 tons, had been hit by a torpedo and a submrnne had
been destroyed.
Great Britain also added to Germany's aVCkoowfedged keMfl
with the claim that one dreadnought of the German Kaiser rla .
?vessels of 24.700 tons and carryinga complement of 1,088 mui
?had been attacked and destroyed by British torpedo craft,
that another battleship of the same class was believed to have
been sunk by gunfire; that one battle-cruisor had been baOWV
up and two others damaged, and that a submarine alao had heen
sent to the bottom.
One Zeppelin Badly Oamaged.
Six Zeppelins participated in the naval engagement off the
coast of Jutland Wednesday, according to a di>pateh from ( o
penhagen to "The Daily Mail." One of the dirigibles, the L-24,
was hit several times and badly damaged, the report aaya, but
she wai able to reach the Schleswig coast after a narrow escape.
Several of her men were wounded and all of her supplios had lo
be thrown overboard.
A dispateh from the same source declares it is grnerally
stated in Berlin that the activity of the German Heef was due
to the energetic demands of Kmperor Williain to hia brotber,
Admiral Prince Ifenry of Pru.ssia. commander-in-ehiei ot* tli
navy, and Admiral von Capelle. Minister of the Navy, on the
Kmperor's visit last week to Wilhelmshaven.
Great Britain's admitted Ioss in tonnage wafl 11 1,810 for
the six battle-eruisers and cruisers. That of Germany, excIlK
ing the tonnage of the Wiesbaden. of svhich veatel then* ia no
record, was 15.712. The tonnage of the capital ships sunk bj
the Japanese in their fight with the Russians in the battle of
Tsushima in May. 1906) aggregated 93,000. Twenty-one
sian craft were destroyed in this tight. inclllding - battleehipfl
and four cruisers. The remainder of the Blinken craft com*
prieed coast defence and special service veaaela and torpedo
boats.
Ships Suffer Heavy ( asualtie
That the casuaities in the fighting ort' J itland were heavy
is indicated by the fact that of the crew of ion e 900 on board
the Indefatigable only two men are known to have i" en aved.
