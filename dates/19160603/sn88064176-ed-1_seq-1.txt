State Democratic Platform.
Baton Rouge, May 23.-The
convention adopted the following
resolution:
"Be it resolved by the demo
cratic party of the state of Lou
isiana in convention assembled,
"1. That we affirm our alle
giance to the national democratic
party and commend the adminis
tration of President Wilson to
the people of our state and the
nation.
"2. That we endorse the many
and varied achievements of the
national democratic administra
tion looking to the welfare and
relief of the masses of our
country.
"3. That we endorse the
course of President Wilson and
congratulate him upon his suc
cess in having preserved to us
the blessings of peace, amidst
the world at war, without in
volving the loss of national pres
tige, and commend his course in
the earnest effort that he has
shown in preserving peace with
honor.
"4. That we endorse the pro
gram of preparedness that is
now being enacted into law by
the democratic congress ulon the
recommendation of the demo
cratic president, believing as we
do, that thorough preparedness
is the only guarantee of public
safety and peace.
"That we call to the attention
of the national democratic ad
ministration that we have the
-~ot., extensive and vulnerable
sea boaZr ,' 'le all possible ene
mies are separa zi~"r1 us by
the seas. and that the horrors of
war can never be brought to our
shores until after the American
navy is destroyed; that. as a pow
erful navy is the first line of de
fense, and if made sufficiently
strong, guarantees us peace, we
therefore urge that our navy be
increased and enlarged until it is
demonstrably stronger than any
possible enemy or any two of
them combined.
"6. That we affirm our belief
in the time-honored principle of
the doctrine of tariff for reve
nue, and congratulate this demo
cratic administration in its rec
ognition of this doctrine by the
*re-imposition of the revenue tar
iff on sugar.
"7. We endorse and approve
the efforts of our democratic
president and the democratic
congress in securing federal aid
toward the improvement of the
Mississippi river and the con
struction along its banks of ade
quate levees guaranteeing immu
nity from overflow from the wa
ters poured down upon 42 states
of the Union.
"8. That we extend our con
gratulations to the democratic
party of this state on the over
whelming victory of April last
against the first serious opposi
'tion in 20 years, and we com
mend the course of those mem
bers of the party holding demo
cratic commissions who, by voice
and vote, contributed materially
to this result.
"9. That we endorse and ap
prove and reaffirm the democrat
ic platform adopted by the state
central committee of the demo
cratic party in New Orleans on
February 9, 1916, and recom
mend to the general assembly,
now in session, the writing into
the statute books of all of the
fundamental reforms advocated
thereby.
"10. The experience of the
Southern states, and more espe
cially the experience of Louisi
an, has shown that the effective
exercise of the negro franchise
is incompatible with Caucasian
civilisation.
"The 15th amendment of the
constitution of the United States
was intended by its framers to
confer the electoral franchise up
on negroes, and the recent de
cisions of the federal supreme
court, in the cases coming up
from Maryland and Oklahoma,
have demonstrated that no law
can be devised by human inge
nuity which will successfully
evade or nullify its provisions.
But experience has shown that
when the white people of the
Southern states have held to
gether, settled their differences
in white primaries, and used the
general election only to record
the will of the majority, the ne
gro vote is eliminated and the
state is as effectually governed
and controlled by its white pop
ulation as it was previous to the
adoption of the 15th amendment.
"From 1898 to 1916 the white
primary has been, in Louisiana,
an effective and impregnable
bulwark against negro suffrage.
But in the recent campaign the
doctrine was advanced, and is
still being preached, that no
voter who has participated in a
primary election, is bound by the
result thereof and that he is le
gally and morally free to repudi
ate the result of the primary
election and to join with and as
sist the enemies of his party.
"If the doctrine prevails (and
the number who acted therein in
the recent election shows the
alarming spread of the heresy),
its inevitable result will be to
destroy the white primary, and
restore the negro electorate, as it
existed from 1868 to 1898, with
the result that the negroes, hold
ing the ballance of power, will
control the destinies of the state.
"11. Whereas, certain self
styled democrats have not only
frequently and repeatedly failed
to respond to democracy's call,
but have, in the recent guberna
torial and congressional contests,
given aid and comfort to the en
emy.
"12. We therefore call on the
democratic members of the gen
eral assembly to organize a dem
ocratic caucus and to formulate
and pass primary election, gen
eral election and registration
laws which will preserve the pu
rity and binding force of the
white primary; which will brand
party perfidy as a crime: and
which will stamp out and des
troy the abominable and shame
ful doctrine of party treachery
which was preached and prac
ticed during the last campaign."
A Twice-Told Tale
One of Interest to Our Readers.
Good news bours repeating, and when
it is congrmeid after a long lapse of
aime, even if we hesitate to believe it
at firs hearing, we feel secure in ac
cepting its truth now. The following
experience of an Alexandria man is
confirmed after five years:
J. B. Gibson, 422 Lee St., Alexan
dria. La., says: "I had weak kidneys
since a boy and my back often gave
out. As the years went by, the trou
ble became worse and my back was
most troublesome. The kidney secre
tions were two frequent and painful in
passage and I often had to arise at
night Three boxes of Doan's Kidney
Pills benefitted me in every way. My
back became stronger and my kidneys
became regular in actien." (State
ment given May 18, 1306.)
STILL USES DOAN'S.
Over five years later, Mr. Gigson
said: "Whenever my kidneys get out
of order. Doan's Kidney Pills give me
relief."

ACardt Owners
of Rural Telephone Lines;
We are anxious to see that ill lias owaed' ,
other parties and connected with us are kept 1a hps M
condition as to furnish effitcient service. Where the
owners of rural lines are repoible for their upkeep,
we want to co-operate with them.
AU lines require a thorough ov eresulg oa
slonally if the best service is to be obtained. We
recommend that every line connected wlth us b
overhauled at least once a year, and that at least ow'
experienced telephone ma eassist in this work. 'he
cost of this work when divided among all thelpetos
of the line, makes the amount paid by each i:is
small, and this cost will be more than allfet by tie
improved service.
If the owners of rural telephone lines in thois eeo
don are experiencing trouble with their service,
will appreciate their talking the matter over with our
Manager or writing us fualy. We will gsldl do
what we can tohward hplag you improve the rcon.
