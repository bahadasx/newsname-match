"This gossip besmirched -and
scourged the name of the firm by re
marks evidently emanating from her,"
he declared. Mr. Uenehan then in
sisted thnt the relation of attorney
and client had not been established,
and that tho suit to collect fees was
clearly for preliminary services ren
dered, and. was brought in lieu of a
suit for .s'ander, as it was difficult to
prow the source of the slander.
"Admitting," he said, "for argu
ment's sake, Indiscretion and Impru
dence of advertising1 for a client, this
is not so great an offense as to merit
tho severe penalty of disbarment,
which to the profession Is worse than
a penitentiary sentence, nor does a
dingle Instance constitute tho offense
of barr itry, the gist of which Is a con
tinuance of such a practice. It was
imprudence and indiscretion, meas
ured by 'hindsight' rather than fore
sight," Mr. Uenehan declared, "and
the matter was surrounded by entang
ling and confusing circumstances
which might easily have warped judg
ment. F.ven attorneys arc. not Infalli
ble in thoir judgment.-'
Mr. Uenehan then maintained that
it was for I'etra Garcia nnd her coun
sel to object to the appearance against
the estate of the firm of Marron &
Wood in the original trial of tho case.
Judge K. It. Wright, taking up the
argument at this point on behalf of
the respondents, said that the failure
to object was equivalent to a waiver.
He then argued that Juan Antonio

Washington, June 2. Despite the
threatening tone of General (Curran
a's last note, his military forcen in
Chihuuhua state are being disposed
in general accord with the plan dis
closed by General Obregon during his
conference at El Paso with Generals
Scott and Funston. ' This was shown
today when General Kimston sent
word that the 20,ut0 Carranza soldiers
mobilized within the last few days at
Chihuahua City had been spread over
the region not controlled by General
Pershing's column in a way to carry
out an active pursuit of bandits.
Secretary Maker said that General
Obregon had promised to send a large
number of men in pursuit of the ban
dits and all war department advices
Indicated that Oils plan wus being
carried out. He added that he now
knew of nothing to prevent the send
ing of new expeditions Into Mexico
after raiders, provided a hot trail was
followed. Otherwfc. he declined to
discuss statement In the Carranza
note, particularly tltosn portions that
contend that General Scott promised
that no more troops would be sent
Into Mexico. Mr. linker holds that
any discussion of the note Is a state
I department matter. He has already

conference prepared , by General

AGAINST SUCGGMNG
Douglas, Ariz., June 2. Venustlano
Carranza, head of the de facto, gov
ernment In Mexico, has ordered civil
and military 'authorities in Sonora to
take extreme measures, if necessary,
to prevent the smuggling of cattle
from Mexico into the l'nited States.
This followed an official report from
General Calles, commander-in-chief of
the Sonora army, that foreign cor
porations holding land in northern
Mexico were using their proximity to
the border to smuggle cull In in large
numbers.
As Interpreted by lves (). I.elevicr,
de facto Mexican consul here, the new
order means thnt the Mexican mili
tary or civil authorities ate to shout
to kill if they cannot stop smuggling
of cattle in any other way.
Following; recent smuggling, Gen
eral Calles established a. zone of fif
teen miles south of the border In
which no cattle could be driven with
out special permission and only then
under supervision of u military escort.
Whether anyone not authorized to
do so found driving cattle in this zone
would be held guilty of smuggling and
punished under the "extreme meas
ures" order, Is a mooted question
here. .v

found guilty by the court of special

ho was convicted today was the deso-
oration of the American flag In cir

found White guilty without leaving

hloMli,"- tip or one hat tie cruiser, the damaging of two other vessels of
this i'Iiism and the ramming and sinking ol' a German submarine.
London, June 2. Picking its way
from its base in the Kiel canal the
German high seas fleet on Wednesday
afternoon entered the North sea and
off the const of Jutland engaged u
Hritlsh fleet throughout the afternoon
an, night in what probably was the
greatest naval battle in the worlds
history so far as tonnage engaged and
tonnage destroyed was concerned.
' When the battle ended Great liri
taln had lost the battle cruisers
queen Mary, Indefatigable and Invin
cible, the cruisers Defence, Hlack
Prince and Warrior and eight torpedo
boat destroyers, while the German
battleship Poinmern had been sent to
the bottom by a torpedo and the
cruiser Wiesbaden sunk by Mritisli
gunfire. In addition several (ieiinaii
torpedo craft were missing and Die
small cruiser Fraueiiloh had last been
seen badly listing and was I elii veil to
have gone to the bottom. These loss
es have all been admitted by Great
Mrltain and Germany.
Hritlsh Mattle.-hip Sunk..
Aside from Great Hi'itaiu's conced
ed losses Germany claims that the
Hritlsh battleship Warspite, sister
ship of the queen Elizabeth, and one
of the largest anil most powerful ships
afloat, hud been sunk; that t lie battle
ship Marlborough, a vessel of 2,000
tons, had been hit by a torpedo and
a eubiuai'lnc had been destroyed.
Great Mrita.n also added to Germany's
acknowledged losses with the claim
that one ilieadnaurhl of the Kaiser
class vessels of l'4,"al tons and car
rying a complement of l.u.sx imn
had been attacked and destroyed by
Mritisli torpedo craft, that another
battleship of the s.iine class was be
lieved to have I ceo sunk by gunfire,
that one buttle erul:;, r lias been blown
up and two oiheis ilumagcd and tiiat
a submarine also had been sent to
the bottom.
Mritisli los Meaty.
Great Mrilain's admitted losses in
tonnage was 114.S10 for ."lx battle
cruisers nnd cruisers. That of Ger
many, excluding the tonnage of the
Wiesbaden, of which vessel there Is no
record, was la, 172. The tonnage of
the capital ships sunk by the Jap
anese In their fight with the Russians
in the battle of Tsushima In May,
190!i, aggregated 9:i.0il0. Twenty-one
Russian craft were destroyed In this
fight, Including six battleships and
four cruisers. The remainder of the
sunken craft comprised const defense
and special service vessels and tor
pedo boats. '
That the casualties In the fighting1
off Jutland were heavy is Indicated
by the fact that of the crew of the
some 900 on board the Indefatigable,
only two men are known to have been
saved. Full detulls of tho fight, in
which Zeppelins are declared to have
taken part, are being gathered by the
Hritlsh admiralty and pending; thulr
receipt the censor Is withholding per
mission to correspondents to send out
stories from London.
After rumors had been fly
ing about all day that a naval
buttle had occurred In the North sea,
tho Hritlsh public was given, news by
the admiralty this evening that will
send a painful shock throughout tho
country.
According to the admiralty an
nouncement, in an engagement off
Jutland on Wednesday aftttrnoon tha
Hritlsh battle cruiser fleet met a Ger
man flei t, with the result that three
Hritlsh battle cruisers were sunk, to
gether with three cruisers und several
destroyers, while six destroyers were
still unaccounted for.
German lmsc I'uknnwn.
The battle seems to have lasted
through the afternoon and the follow
ing night. The German fleet' losses
are stated to have been serious, but
no very definite information of thesn
losses is afforded by the admiralty
announcement. One battle cruiser is
declared to have been destroyed and
another severely damaged, while tho
belief Is expressed that a large num
ber of German destroyers were dis
posed of.
The news was flashed out 111 spcclnl
editions of the evening newspapers
and caused greater consternation in
the west end of I'Hdon than had been
witnessed, "n any previous occasion
since the declaration of war. Tho
frankness of the admiralty nnnounfe
mi nt eoneernlnv the serious nature of
the Mritisli losses and the apparently
small losses of the Germans in com
parison, led to the assumption In most
minds that the Hritlsh vessels must
have been led into a r.itiie field.
Merlin McKits Mutlleshii. LonL
Following quickly upon the admir
alty announcement, came the German
official version of the fight which in
general confirms the British account,
but curries the claim that the battle
ship Warspite also was sunk and other
Mrllish battleships damaged.
The German losses, according to th
