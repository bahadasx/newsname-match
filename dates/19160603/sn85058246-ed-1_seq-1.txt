KING 8 IN

The Motor 'Sales Corporation, local

VEIL LIFTED;
WHAT IS A
CHAUTAUQUA?
Just uow every ono in Logan Is
wondering what the word Chaulau
qua means. Wo see Chautauqua but
tons on overy breast, Chautauqua
cards In every, shop window, and
Chautauqua banners all along Main
s reel. Wo have heard peoplo specu
u ate as to whether Chautauqua 1, a
cheese, a big chief or a false prophet.
By far tho best definition of tho
v.'qrd is that given by our g-nlal fel
low citizen, Mr. Low Edwards. Ho
says that n Chautauqua s a mixture
of a circus and n housekeepers' con
ference. Logan loves both, and will
bo glad to tasto tho mixture.
Like a housekeepers' or fanners'
confersneo a Chautauqua is open to
all, it has priceless uplift features,
and it hag social features that draw
tho community together from far and
wldo. But like a circus It is vastly
entertaining as well as instructive
and has a different ring for overy
day in the week. You get lectures on
travel, civic Improvement, and ull ot
the problems of Ilfo, and you also get
band and grand opera music, sister
acts, a Kafllr side show, readcrn, and
singers.
Llko nil good things tho Chautau
qua came to us from out tlm church!
About forty years ago tho Methodist
Church conceived tho idea of n sura
tner school for Biblo study on the
shores of Lake Chautauqua In Now
York stato. The Idea took llko wild
flro, especially when they began to
study something elso besides the Bl
blc, and now tho mother school teach
es not only Bible, but everything tin
der the sun to thousands of students
each summer, and all over tho Uni
ted States lecturo courses with mu
slca features have spruug np In im
Itatlon of tho Chautauqua Idea.. At
last It has reached Logan and, tho
list of musicians and lccturern that
nro coming to Logan during tho week
of Juno 12 Is well, worthy of Logan's
attention.
Tho business men of Logan to tho
number of thirty-flvo ar6 giving the
movement its financial backing. Thoy
bellevo that Logan as a collcgo city
and county seat should offor lis citi
zens and neighbors a week of excel
lent entertainment. They also know
that tho Chautauqua lecturers go
all over tho United States and will
be glad to speak n good word every
where for our Httlo city.
Logan Is getting Into line on all
of tho big city movements. Wo have
long had all the necessary city equip
ment except a public library and a
high school, and now like big Salt
Lake, Ogden, Provo, and tiny Tooele,
no nro going to havo our Chautauqua

WEDNESDAY IS
GOOD ROADS DAY
IN THE COUNTY
1
Noxt Wednesday, Juno 7, has been
designated as Good Ronds Day, and
it Is expected that every team whl6h
was promised for May 24, will be on
hand. The sub commltteo on teams
will niako a rccanvass In order to
mako suro of the necessary number.
Tho committee on pits and distrib
ution of material have been appoint
ed to visit the merchants and as
certain how many men can bo per
mitted to work on tho road next Wed
nesday. To keep tho largo number
of teams busy It will bo very neces
sary that tho various firms lot all
the men go that they possibly can
spare. A special effort will ue made
to sccuro Blngle handed men outside
of the business section. The plan Is
to get tho material on tho road nn,d
If necessary most of tho men will bo
placed In tho pits and the material
placed later by other means.
TJ10 U. A. C. Faculty and college
hands havo agreed to work on tho ,
road extending around the college
hill. This will be n big help as tiie
read Is very rough mid uneven.
Citizens from River Heights havo
also agreed to work on the road leau
Ing from River Heights to Logan.
The Roads committee will cooperate
as fnr as possible with the peoplo
as this road Is much traveled nnd
netds repair.
The refreshment commltteo ,wlll be
out In tho forenoon nnd afternoon
with n good supply of meat and
cheeso sandwiches, etc., for nil tho
workmen.
As the 'schools are closed It Is ex
pected that a largo number of boy
scouts, local students and professors
will usstst. The Brlgham Young Col
lego faculty will be called upon for
nEslstance.
Some people refuso to iwork, on tho
roads not passing their places or in
terests. This is absolutely the
wrong stand to tako ns the efforts
must bo confined, otherwise no ro
Biilts can be obtained. Furthermore
tho main highways must receive at
tention first, so tho traveling public
can get In and out of tho city with
easo. Tourists will not enter and
leavo the city on side streets, there
fore If tho main highways are not
In good condition, ono city gets un
favorable advertising and drives the
business away.
Tho Logan, canyon road Is a most
Important one as it Is a branch of
tho Ycllowstono Highway nnd a stato
highway. Asldo from Main It Is per
haps used mora In tho summer than
any other road. It is traveled much
by tho tourists who go away and ad,
vcrtlso our beautiful canyon.
For these and other reasons the
work next Wednesday will bo con
fined to tho Logan canyon road. Ev
ery loyal citizen who can possibly get
awny should bo at tho Commercial
Club Wednesday, Juno 7, at 8 a.m.
to do a full day's work.
