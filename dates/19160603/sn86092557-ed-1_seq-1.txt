FOR HER INFANT

COURT HOUSE NURSERY
Totan Had Set Limit Upon
Yasco's Life Neighbors
Say.
With Jaw aet and defiant eye, Mrs. |
Andrew Yasco, widow and confessed
' Blayer of her husband Andrew Yasco,
miner employed at Hutchinson, paces
f her cell today, little worried over her
predicament and only asking for her
ftmr-months'-old baby. Pleading with
all earnestness with Prosecuting At
torney "Walter Haggerty and other
county officials, tho Humane society
asks that the baby which is in need
of a mother's care, be taken into the
jail cell to the mother.
This tho county refuses as tho rule3
are plain that no children not charged
with crime of any sort be taken Into
the cells.
The child's godmother has taken the
Infant together with the other three
email children belonging to Mrs. Yas
! co, and Is caring for them in the lobby
! of the Court House while about 15
or 18 neighbor women frionds of the'
j Yasco family assist in comforting the
young oneB.
The oldest child a boy who Is per
haps eight years of age, 1b terribly af
I fllcted, being sub-normal mentally. The
| neighbors who have known Mrs. Yas
co for some time claim that this de
i flclency in the boy is a direct inheri
ts tance from the mother.
MrB. Yasco told Prosecuting Attor
ney Walter Haggerty last evening
through on Intorpretor that she had
j killed her husband with a revolver fur
nished by John Totan, who she claims
j Insisted that she kill her husband,
| set his insurance and fly with Totan.
! Twice before has Totan given her the
revolver she says and by his superior
ity of will almost forced her to murder
| her husband but she failed to do go.
i John Yokimlchuc, boardor In the
I Yasco home, says that he saw Totan
and Mrs. Yasco cleaning and loading
j the gun the evening previously to the
| murder. Neighboring Italians (Yas
co and family are Austrtens) told
I Sheriff Conaway that they had often
heard Totan toll Yasco that "You'll
' be dead before Green Sunday." They
I Informed the sheriff that Green Sun*
i day will be tomorrow. Whon asked
, how he knew that Yasco would b?
; dead before tomorrow Totan dropped
V his head and after thinking said ho
knew nothing about it.
An attempt was made against the
life of Yasco last Sunday when Totan
took the four Yasco children for a
| walk. Before loaving the house he
j and Mrs. Yasco had prepared a poison
! potion consisting chiefly of lye which
I it was intended that Yasco should
1 drink. In what manner it was prepar
ed or how the poison was to be dis
!;? qulsed could not be learned, Mrs. Yas
co simply saying that she tried to
kill him for he "didn't want to drink."
She also says that Totan, should she
| fall In her attempts on her husband's
j life. Intended to have a fall of slate |
; kill him in tho mine in which both
! were working. How this was to bo
i done she does not know, only saying
that Totan knew that it could be done
and that it would "before Green Sun
i day."
Yasco is described by tho people
knowing him as a homo-loving, hard
working man who always treated his
wife with the greatest kindness, and
who never susplcioned that all was not
well In the relations of Totan and Mrs.
Yasco.
John Totan and Mrs. Elizabeth Yas
co both were Indicted on true bills
this afternoon by the Grand Jury,
j Yokimlchuc is still held as a witness.
The Yasco case will come before the
I present term of court, being placed
on the Criminal docket for this term.

HANGING HIGH
Considerable Inter-Class
Rivalry in Two Local
Schools.
Rip Saw Rip Saw! Rip Saw, Bang!
the students of the Fairmont State
Normal and High school are'at it
again. The seniors of the Normal have
at last placed a pennant In such a po
sition thut It is next to impossible for
the Juniors to tear down. But what
of the juniors?
Last night the Normal seniors plac
ed a pennant on the tower of the Nor
mal school building with the Inscrip
tion "Seniors, '16." This followed a
battle botween a Junior boy and sen
ior girl at school yesterday afternoon
when the junior attempted to take a
baner from a window of the dormitory
without success.
The Juniors would not let the sen
ior get a head of them and one of their
dare-dovils, climbed the eight flights
of stairs In the Watson building this
afternoon between the hours of twelve
and one o'clock and placed a large
bannor of the flag staff of the build
ing with "Juniors F. N. S. N. '17" in
large black letters on it.
But this does not limit the exploits
of the two classes as the Seniors
thought that they had a few dare-dev*
lis of their own and to prove it a "Sen
iors F. S. N. S. '16" appeared in large
red letters on the cliff bolow tbe Cof
fey house.
The High school is not back in class
spirit as is shown by the appearance
of an A. B. Fleming Junior class pen
nant on the flag staff of the Watson
building this morning which was
quickly removed by E. A." Marshall,
superintendent of the building. This
is the second banner placed by the
High school juniors, the flrst was on
a telephone polo at the corner of Firth
and Benoni avenue, which was quickly
removed by the seniors.
The seniors of the High school have
still another original stunt in a sign
on the Deveny building facing Mon
roe Btreet. This occupies leased space
and was paid for just as Is any pat
ent medicine sign.

Jury in circuit court. All of these were
felony charges and includo the indict- j
ments against John Totan and Eliza-1
both Yasco, charged with the murder

The indictments against Linn, Show
alter and Strador are practically the
same as those found at the former ses
sions of the Grand Jury and were evi
dently prepared by the prosecution as
a precaution In case flaws are found
In the former indictments when they
come to trial.
All of these true bills were returned
shortly after noon and the Jury hav
ing completed its work was dismiss
ed by Judgo Haymond. Although the
jurors did not begin tho hearing of
evidence ths morning until ten o'clock
yet a large number of witnesses wero

last evening, President Daniel Willard
of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad,

President Willard had been to St.

Mr. Willard was questioned by re

the matter was being very well ham\?

Dutch Saliors Tell
How Elbing Sank
(By Associated Press)
YMUIDEN, Netherlands, June 3.?
These details of the sinking of the
German cruiser Elbing were learned
here today from Dutch crews, German
sailors and the Dutch militaty com
mander of tYmuiden, who spoke to
three of the German cruisor'a officers.
The Elbing was a new and fast cruis
er of about 4,000 or 5,000 tons and car
ried a crew of 450.
The British gun Are caused such
destruction on the s*tip t\at Captain
Madling who was among the three of
ficers saved, decided to have the
valves opened and to allow the ves
sel to sink. Before the Elbing went
down the bulk of the crew was taken
over by a German torpor boat but
doubts may be expressed as to wheth
er the sailors arrived safely at Wll
helm shaven.
Twenty-one men remained on board
till the vessel foundered when they
left in a life boat. Later they were
picked up by a Dutch trawler. Mem
bers of the Dutch crew said when
.the Elbing sank the sea was covered
with drift-wood and bodies were float
ing around. Some of the sailors saw
a German war ship In a sinking con
dition while others noticed ships blaz
ing.

Fleet's Great Victory Has
Aroused Enthusiasm
in Germany,
BERLIN IS FLAG DECKED
?Full German High Seas Fleet
Was Engaged in the
Battle.
(Wireless from staff correspondent of
The Associated Press via Sayville, N.
Y.)
BERLIN, June 3?The first naval
battle on a grand scale during the pres
ent war has been attended by results,
which, according to the infomatlon
received here, are highly satisfactory
to the Germans not only in respect of
the comparative losses of the two
fleets but in the fact that the Germans
maintained the field after the battle.
This is shown, German commentators
assert, by the rescue of British surviv
ors.
The full German h!gh seas fleet en
gaged under the personal command
of Vico Admiral Scheer, the energet
ic German commander who succeed
ed Admiral Von Pohl. Tho British
fleet is now estimated at approximate
ly twice as strong in guns and ships
as that under Admiral Scheer.
Detailed reports have not yet been
received but the main engagement
apparently occurred about 125 miles
southwest of the southern extremity
?>* Nroway and 150 miles off the Dan
ish coaBt. The battle .was divided in
two sections. The day engagement
began about 4 oclock in the afternoon
and continued until darkness or about
nine o'clock.
This was followed by a series of
separate engagements through tho
night. The exact ranges and course
of the day fight have not been ascer
tained... ILia_aaaumed the ranges of
the day engagements were not ex
treme. possibly at distance of eight
miles as the weather was hazy. That
the German torpedo boats and destroy
ors were more effective than the Brit
ish accounts to a considerable extent
for the successes of the Germans
against nn overwhelmingly superior
force. It is understood the Queen
Mary and the Indefatigable were both
sunk In the day battle. All the Ger
man warships except those mentioned
In the ofTlcial renort reached Wilhelm
haven safely. Thus far nothing has
been reported regarding tho extent to
which any of tho vessels wore damag
ed.
A fuller report from Admiral Scheer
Is expected soon. It is stated at the
Admiralty that at least 34 British cap
ital ships were engaged and that the
British torpedo flotilla were severely
handled. The battleship Wostfalon
alone sank 6 torpedo boats during the
nipht encounters. Gorman personnel
and material alike stood the test bril
liantly and the damage sustained bv
the Gorman fleet is small 'in compari
son with tho British looses. The bat
tleshln Pom mem whirh was sunk was
commanded bv Cnntafn Boolken.
Berlin Is'"decked with flags and the
achievment of the German fleet has
aroused the greatest enthusiasm.

Greatest Naval
Engagement In
Modern History
Although neither side has bbon
entirely frank in the official ac
counts of the great naval battle in
the North sfea, off the coast of Nor
way it is apparent that it was the
greatest naval action of the war
and perhaps the greatest since the
discovery of gun powder.
One estimate made by an Eng
lish naval authority places the num
ber of ships engaged at 150. And
for the first time in all history
ships of the air and undersea**
ships took part with regular wor
ships in actual combat. There is
roason to believe that Zeppelins
and U-boats were more resonslblo
for the German victory than wcro
the capital ships.
British admiralty admits loss of
the battle cruisers: Queen Mary.
Invincible, Indefatigable. Armored
cruisers: Warrior. Black Prince,
Defence. Destroyers: Fortune,
Sparrowhawk, Tlpperary Turbul
ent. Six other destroyers unreport
ed.
German Admiralty admits Iobs
of the battleship Pomhicrn, thlra
class cruiser; Welsbaden; several
torpedo boats. The protected cru
iser Fraunenlob missing.
German admiralty claims de
struction of the Warspite, Queen
Mary. Indefatigable, two armored
cruisers, one small cruiser and
many destroyers, and serious dam
<? age to the battleship Marlborough.
The total number of men on the
BrltJsh ships sunk, if they wqro
carrying normal complement, was
6.258, excluding the crews of two
destroyers, with unrecorded com
plements.
The total loss of British tonnage
claimed by the Germans Is 125,*
850.
The loss in German tonnago admit
ted by- the German admiralty is 5,
915.
CRIER SQUADRON
AGAINST BIG FLEET
LONDON, June 3.?Careful com
parison of British and German reports
of the sea fight off the Danish coasa
seem to indicate that "Vice Admiral
Sir David Beatty's cruiser squadron
came lr. contact with the Gorman main
fleet or possibly, in the first instance
a portion of that corps.
Although aware that he was oppos
ing a stronger force than his own the
official statement make It appear, na
val observers say, that Vice Admiral
Beatty courageously engaged the Ger
mans.
Later, presumably, the whole Ger
man fleet appeared. Vico Admiral
Beatty was then completely outnum
bered and before Admiral Jelllcoo's
main fleet was able to get into action
the Germans made off.
According to ostimates made here,
which in the absence of official figures
can only be conjectural, the British
losses in men must be some where in
the neighborhood of 500.
It is similarly estimated that Ger
man losses were at least between 2000
and 3000 men.
