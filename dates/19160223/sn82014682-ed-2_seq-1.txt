dividends for the year, amounting
to $120,000, there remained a balance
of $98,581.34 to be carried forward to
the credit of profit and loss.
Mr. Blake's report commented on
the fact that although the maximum
lighting rate had been reduced on Jan
uary 1, 1915, from 12H cents -to 10
cents, and the maximum power rate
from 12 cents to 10 cents per kilo
vatt. the company'a business showed
an increase which took up to a con
siderable extent the loss In revenue
vhlch might have been expected from
the reduction In rates.
Gain Made Last Year. ,
The total number of consumers
terved by the company at December
31, 1915, waa 7u31;.the total number,
of lights connected to the company's
service1 at that time being 95,028; the
total -connected horsepower motor
loa4 was 4627 horsepower, both depart
menta showing a, considerable gain for
1915.; , -j .
In 1915 the company manufactured
&511 tons more Ice than In 1914, while
its cold storage and merchandise de
partments also show healthy in
. creases. . - .'"
-. During the year the company en
tered Into agreements with the army
and navy officials to extend Its lines
to supply electric light and power to
the naval station and Fort Kame
hameha at Pearl Harbor and to Scho
lield Barracks at Castner. From the
present condition of this work Mr.
Blake (estimated that extensions
should be completed by August 1.
This line will carry the company's ser
vice Into the country for a distance of
24 miles and should be a very Im
portant factor in the future growth
of the business. - r

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. .23.
There Is little likelihood of the senate
rassing Senator Gorgus resolution, un
der the terms of which the United
States government would warn Ameri
cans not to travel on merchant ships
of the belligerents.
At today's session of Congress, mem
bers had a good deal to say in discus
sion of the resolution, and most of the
comment was sharply adverse. Unless
the administration should desire the
passage of the measure, it stands lit
tle chance. President Wilson la op
