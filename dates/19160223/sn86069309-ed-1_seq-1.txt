tombs were dropped.
A feature of tho official account Is
tho frank admission that British air
craft, one naval plane and two aero
planes, which ascended to attack the
raiders, failed to reach tiiem. It ap
pears tho German planes are ca)abIo
of ascending to an extraordinary
height.
Tho war ofllco states that two bi
planes, after circling over tho town
of Lowestoft, in Kent, "rose to a
great height and seemingly vanished."
Fifteen minutes later they reappeared
over the town and then flew to tho
' east.
I At Lowestoft It develops only three
bombs hit buildings. Others fell on
waste ground. Into gardens, on the
heach and Into the sea, none of them

tho capture near Bazar-SJak, a short

bania, the belief having provailcd that
their activities had been confined to
tho locality adjacent to Avlona.
That progress Is being mado by tho
Teutonic allies In tho direction of
Avlona seemingly Is shown by the re
port that tho Albanians who aro fight

of Herat, situated about thlrty-ono
miles northeast of Avlona.
