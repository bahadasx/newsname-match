WILSON READY FOR BREAK
IF DM TRIES TO DELAY
DEFINITE U-BOAT REPLY
President Ready to Submit the
Whole Incident to Congress
Within a Hew Days.
OLD DEMANDS STAND.
And Germany Must Withdraw
Her Decree Against Armed
Merchantmen.
WASHINGTON, Feb. S3.--The rela
tions between tho t'nlted States and
Germany this nfter,oon depended
entirely upon Instructions believed to
bo on routo from the. Kaiser's Govern
ment lo bis Ambassador tn..J5jltth
Ingtnn. It became known thnt President
Wilson has determined to, permit no
more parleying n the submarine con
troversy. If termitn, 1 Adminis
tration officials now believe likely,
endeavors to bring about further
complications, the President Is pre.
pared to cut matters short by placing
the whole Incident In the hands of
Congress,
The Prerident, nfllrlals said to-d.iy,
Is dono with parleying. Already, thev
say, as tho result of vigorous activi
ties on his part in the past few days
tho agitation among Democrats In
Congress for a resolution warning
Americans to keep off armed mer
chantmen has collapsed.
Investigation this afternoon dis
closed that Democrats favoring such
a resolution havn not changed their
mind, but the Idea that tho White
Houso would support tho action hav
lug been blasted, the deslro to press
a resolution has disappeared.
To-dny It was declared, on trust
worthy nuthorlt, that th" President
intends to makn his refusal to tem
porlro so emphatic that thorn would
bo no doubt left of his purpose to re
quire a closing of tho l.usltania nego
tlatlons In kenplng with the original
demandssof this Government. Since
Germany Is not ox-peeted to withdraw
thn armed merchantman decree, It
was pointed out, ono thing only will
bo loft for the President to do and
that Is to cut off diplomatic relations.
This would meun the handing of his
passportB to Ambassador von Unrn
storff. Tho President, It Is drlared, Is
committed to the move, but does not
deslio lo act without llrst laying the
matter bnforo Congress.
II was evidently on tho suggestion
of the White House that Senator
Stone announced this faturnoon that
he might abandon his plan to answer
Kllhu Hoot's criticism of the admin
istration's foreign polio. While ho
gave no reason for his determination,
It was apparent that he saw the
possibility of opening up the whole
subject.
Hcpubllcan Senators who lux o
hesitated ubout attacking the Presl
dent nt this particularly critical 11111"
would hlivo felt the restriction ie.
moved had Stone taken the floor of
thi Senate tj make win! they would
regard as a partisan defense against
a i aitlran attack.
While Administration iirolcs look
! glooin outlook of tint situation
this afluruoon, U was suggested that
as n the enso of the Unislng-Hern-htnrff
trouble, publicity of the facts
inlklil serve lo piexent a break. It
v,u pointed out that even in event
of the President going befoie Con
gress an opportunity would be pre.
Dented, between thn reading of any
incssinre jy Wlli-on anil action by
; Cnngrees which Germany might "see
;a light."

BORN CITIZENS
Recognizes They Are Just as
Much American as Any
Native of the Country.
WA8UINGTON, Feb., IJ. Speaking
toa-Jare delegation of Ilungurlan
born cltUtns of Now York, President
Wilson to-day expressed "unqualified
confidence" In the representatives of
that country now In America.
"I have never myself doubted for a
moment," tho President said, "tho
feeling that gentlemen, such as your
s1Vch, have toward America. 1
recognize you uro Just as much
Americans ns anybody burn In this
country.
"I have deplored, nnd 1 am sure
you hftn united ulth m In deploring
tho spirit which has been manifested
by eomo who hiiNe misrepresented
I host' for whom they profess to sponk,
and my public protest has been
against what they said and against
their misrepresentations: of what I
felt sum was tlm sentiment of the
rank and (Ho of those Americans
born on the other side of (he water,
who have come and enriched America
by giving us their talent and their
work and their alleglnnce.
"So that I welcome tills occasion
as an opportunity of expressing my
unqiiaiiucu conlldeneo In those
thoughtful citizens llko yourselves,
who have Identified themselves In
heart, as well as In fortunn, with this
great country which is so dear to all
of us. which Is compounded of all of
us and which does not belong to uny
one section or portion of us. I bine
tried to show on various occasions
my passion for that quality which
ought to obtain amongst all those
who profess alleglanco to the l.'nlttd
States."
The decb-utou. headed by Ale.
Koula of Now York, called at the
White House, fo present resolutions
passed at a mass meeting In Nun
York on Jan. :).
Fur the delegation. Konta said:
"Your l'!eeoncy's reception of us
Is the proof we want of your faith In
our fidelity to the I'nlted States."
"We represent our fellow cltUens in
all parto of the country, Who author
ized us to speak for them and to make
renewed professions of our allegiance,
if tho country belluven that Is neces
sary." ,
"We have been misrepiesentml in
a period of historj which Is full of
mlsn presentations, Insinuations and
downright slander. It wns Important
to our record hh on clement in (in
making of the fill inn of Ami rlca thai
