What is That Boy Doing.
"That boy Johnnie," remarked
farmer Brown, "would be a
treat bov if he was not all the

a be a working."
"Projecting?" we asked.
What do you mean?"
"Oh, he is always studying up
omething and making all sorts

knew he tiad one cow dry and
nother one nearly bursting

Get This Parcel Post Bulletin.
The farmer who wishes to sell
his products by parcel post, and
the housewife who wishes to use
this method of securing country
produce for her table, will find
many useful points tn Farmers*
Bulletin 703, "Suggestions for
Parcel Post Marketing.** This
bulletin, in addition to explaining
the postal rates and measurement
limits for parcel post mat
ter, discusses in some detail the
types of containers which are
most successful and the methods
of grading and packing produce,
so that it will reach the consumer
in good condition, and be
attractive in quality and appearance.
In treating standards for
parcel post shipments, the bulletin
tells iiow to select, handle
and pack poultry, and how to
grade and pack the various fruits
and vegetabls which the average
farmer is likely to market
through the post office.
The bulletin points out that
one of the common obstacles to
establishing parcel post communication
between farmer and
consumer is that the farmer may
be unwilling to offer goods at a
price which attracts the customer,
or that the consumer may
offer a price lower than the
farmer can obtain at a local mar
ket. To Quote the bulletin!
"Not only must the farmer
have something additional to the
usual price to compensate tifa|
foi the extra work, container,
and postage required, but the
consumer must also have some-,
thing to attract him to marketing
bv parcel post. In determipitffl
whzi the price sbail he, bcWWWi
farm price and the retail Pi$2
paid by the consumer when ib
markets in the. ordinary
should be taken into considera
lion. The consumer must receive
either a better article at
the usual retail price or an article
of the grade usually purchased
at some concession in price.
"It is probable that the point
which will make the strongest
appeal to the average consumer
is that he can secure by parcel
post a fresher, brighter, more attractive,
and thus possibly a bet
ter product than he can obtain
otherwise.
"The average producer, as a
rule, does not realize the importance
of appearance as a factor
in selling goods and frequently
is careless and indifferent in pre
paring produce for market. The
consumer, on the .other hand relies
very largely upon appearance
in selecting food supplies.
and unattractive articles are
passed by promptly,
"A personal acquaintance
should be established between
producer and consumer, when
they come into business contact.
This will help a great deal in
furthering parcel post marketing,
and also will eliminate many of
the misunderstandings which
may occur from time to time.
A definite understanding should
exist as to the duties of each in
ick<iiu iu remittances, claims tor
damaged*or spoiled produce, and
the preservation and return of
containers."

As the front truck of the baggage

it left the tracks arid ran on the

brakes which derailed the Pull

This was the third accidenl
which has befallen the Florida

weeks. On Tuesday of last

trainmen were seriously injured.

Operation a Success, Though
Patient Died.
Waxhaw Enterprise.
Dr. Frank Niven being some
what of a noted surgeon, undertook
a very serious operation on
his bull dog some days ago.
The operation consisted in the
removal of the major part of the
dog's ears and tail. Drs. Bob
Howard and John Collins were
PqIIpH In occict In Ilin nnn.n?!/\n
UUU1UI AU liiv upciauuii.
Dr. Howard administcrd the
anaesthetic while Collins held
the patient.
\s all good surgeons see that
their patient is well anaesthtized
before operating. Dr. Niven
stood with scissors in hand and
chizzle ready when the patient
was well under ether. By the
time one ear had been removed
it was plain that the bull had
passed to the great beyond. Dr.
Niven was so absorbed in the
operation that he failed to real
ize the serious condition of his
patient, and continued the operation
till complete, which was
an entire success, though the pa
tient died. It is thought the dog
was suffering from an acute attack
of cdocarditis, which ren
dered him unable to bear either,
and died from nnaesthetizaiion.

Mr. E. B. Funderburk's store
at Tradesville was broken into
and robbed on Sunday night, i
February 6th instant, and about <
$100.00 worth of goods stolen. .
Mr. Funderburk went to work 1
at . once to find the thief and
goods. He came to Lancaster <
last Saturday evening and was i
soon rewarded with success. He
swore out a warrant for Jim
White, colored, and had him arrested
and jailed, and then he i
immediately hired an automobile i
and, together with Constable i
Caskey, went to Jim White's
i home, a few miles above Lani
caster and found a great many
of his goods which Mr. Funder- :
burk identified as his property. !
Jim White now does not hesitate
to say that he is guilty. He said
at first that Barnes Cauthen, another
negro, who lives near
Tradesville, was also guilty, but
now savs that hp w?? alnnp whon <
he went into the store and that

with it. 1

Monroe Feels Sure Body is McNeely's
Monroe, Feb. 16.?This community,
the home for the past
several years of Consul RoF>ert
Ney McNeely who was drowned
when the British steamer
Persian was torpedoed, has been
naturally greatly interested in
the press reports of the finding
of a body washed ashore near
Alexandria, Egypt, which is
thought to have been that of the
voung government official who
was going to his first post of
duty. There is little doubt here
that the body is that of McNeely.
Carl Griffin, manager of a local
men's store, from which Mr.
McNeely bought furnishing,
says that he sold to Mr. McNeely
the goods mentioned in the press
dispatch with the exception of
the trousers.
Clayton Laney, one of Mr.
McNeely's most intimate friends
and a former room-mate here,
says that the watch reported as
found on the body is undoubtedly
the one his friend wore when
he left Monroe and entered the
employ of the Government.
Rufe McLellan states that he
traded to Mr. McNeelv the watch
described several weeks before
ine muer leit mis city. He also
says that Mr. McNeely placed a
photograph of his mother in the
back of the watch

A novelist recently found himself
in a train with two talkative
women says The New York
Sun. Having recognized him
from his published portraits,
thev opened fire upon him in
regard to his novels, praising
them in a manner which was
unendurable to the sensitive
author.
Presently the train entered a
tunnel and in the darkness the
novelist raised tho back of his
hand to his lips and kissed it
soundly. When light returned,
he found the two women regarding
each other in icy silence.
Addressing them with great
sauvity, he said:
"Ah, ladies, the one regret of
my life will be that I shall never
know which of you it was that
kissed me!"
