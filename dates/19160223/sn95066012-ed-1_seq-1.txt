Enemy Making Little Attempt
Defence But Straining Every

at
Petrograd, Feb. 22. According
to
the latest dispatches reaching Petro
grad from the Caucasian front, the
Turkish losses at Erzerum are esti
mated at 40,000 killed, wounded and
prisoners.
Both on the center in the Erzerum
district and on the widely extended
northern and southern flanks the
Russians are everywhere continuing
with energy pursuit of the routed
Turkish armies. The Russian ad
vance is having the effect not only of
severing all connections between the
now Isolated Turkish army groups,
but of constantly strengthening com
munications of their own forces from
the Black Sea district to the recently
occupied town of Mush on' the south
ern Russian wing.
Thus the operations of the Rus
sians are assuming the character of
a solid and unbroken advance along
tvt n nianv 5a ,
coast the Russians have now driven !
the Turks twenty miles west of Vltz-
eeu, and the occupation of Trebizond
is believed to be imminent
The Turks, evidently impressed
'with the headway the Russian forces
are making, appear to be inspired
with the sole aim of extricating them
selves from their difficult position be
fore they are Burrounded, and are
making no effort to hold endangered
points now in their possession.

Bennington County Road Construction
During 1915
Peru: The road from the Bromley
House east was improved for 27 rods,
the work consisting of widening,
straightening and grading. One mllo
to the east the Cosmus Hill was im
proved, length, 16 1-2 rods. One milo
west of Peru Village work done in 1914
was extended 70 rods toward Manches
ter and grading done several rods fur
ther. Grade was reduced and a large
stone culvert extended. A large stone
culvert 3-4 mile west of Peru Village,
built in 1914, was paved with concrete
as the stone paving originally put In
showed settlement due to a severe
freshet in July.
Rupert: On the road from East Ru
pert to Granville three-fourths mile
from Pawlet line, a gap between pieces
built in 1913 and 1915 was filled in and
an extension added to the 1913 work.
Length 32 1-2 rods, width 18 feet. A
stone foundation was used and a re
taining wall and guard rail were built.
On the west side of the town at Mr.
SmIui Sheldon's farm, 1 1-4 miles from
wlet lln' ? 8hrp .CUr? ,a?d 8teef!
i iiui were iruuteu. a retaining wall
and guard were built. By this work
a specially dangerous spot has been
corrected. Length 80 rods with part
ial grading and ditching extending 13
rods further.
Readsboro: In the village of Heart -wellvllle
a length of 114 rods was
built' With the exception of about
40 rods there is now a continuously
improved road extending from the four
corners at the east end of the village
to Stamford line"; adistancer of two
milea.. '' t .''' "
One mile below Rekdsboro Falls 'a
gapi between two pieces of old state
road was filled. Letigth," 25 Tods, wid-,
th, 18 feet. A mile 'and a quarter
above Readsboro Falls a length of 75
rods was ' uilt' f Surfacing material
was taken from an obstructing bank
at the roadside located north' of the Im'.
provement. ' For the 'greater part o'f
the distance the location was one side
hill and many , boulders and points of
ledge had to be removed by blasting.
The work extends to the north a
piece of State Work put in six year
ago. Grading and widening was also
done near the gravel bank for a dis
tance of 25 rods.
Sandgate: A mile north of Sandgate
village and near the intersection of the
Hamilton Hollow road a gap between
work done in 1914 and an older piece
of state rood was filled. Length, 25
rods. Stone foundation was used. In
the Gallipo woods a mile and a half
south of Sandgat. village a piece' of
state work built about; ten years' ago
was widened 4t having been originally
built to a width of only. 12 feet Its
side hill location made it a very dan
gerous piece of road because of the in
creasing number of automobiles com
ing to Sandgate and owned there.
Length, 38 rods, of which 14 rods was
in elate rock excavation on one side.
Sandgate roads arq 18 feet wide.: -".rt
".. Seareburg: . For several years the
road up the mountain from the Deer
Jleld River has been extended consec
utively.. This year's extension was
91 rods in length. A second piece of
work was done near the old Eames
place, a swampy spot being rebuilt
with stone base. Length 24 rods.
These roads are 20 feet wide. The
lptter work was done entirely at the
State's expense.
Shaftsbury: At the Lake Shaftsbury
turn one mile north of Shaftsbury Stat
ion an especially dangerous curve was
, reduced by heavy ledge excavation on
one side and bank cutting on the oth
er. ' Nearby hollows were filled and
grades "improved.1-Length, 88 rpds.
!, Three-fourths mile north of Shafts
bury Centre three large boulders pro
jecting from the wheeltrack and road
bank were removed making it possi
ble to widen and straighten the road;
a minor improvement but one that had
been, conspicuously needed for many
years. . ..'"
On the White Creek road within
about three-fourths mile of New York
line three metal culverts were reset to
give better 'drainage.
Stamford: North of Stamford vil
lage the road was extended for 91 rods
UBlng crushed stone for s surfacing.
This makes a continuously improved
road from Massachusetts line north
ward for nearly two miles.

THEATRE MANAGER
MAY BAR CRITIC
WHOOISPLEASES
New York Court of Appeals so De
cides Regarding admission
RIGHT CAN NOT 8E QUESTIONED
Civil Rights Act Does Not Apply Be
cause Questions of Color or Race
Are Not Raised.
Albany, Feb. 22. The court of ap
peals today decided that criticism dla-
i pleasing to the controller of a theatre
is legal ground on which - the- critic
may be barred from playhouses un
der D,B control. The question was
involved in the decision handed down
in the case of Alexander Woollcott,
dramatic critic against the Shubcrts.
Th Shuberts establiaheii -". a ban
against admitting Mr. .Woollcott to
any of their playhouses on the ground
that his reviews displeased them.
The decision of the court of ap
peals is written by Judge Frederick
Collin with all the other Judges con
currlng. In it, Judge Collin declared
that under the common law, the right
of a theatrical manager to exclude a
person was unquestioned. The court
also held that the civil rights act did i
not apply in the case because it mere
ly prohibited discrimination against
any person on account of creed, color,
and race, questions that were not in
volved in the Woollcott case.
which was badly washed out by the
July freshet was shifted slightly in
location to bring lf upon higher ground
and regarding. . Surfacing was not
done. Length, 57 rods.
7 .Near Mr. Geo. T. Canedy's farm, two
miles north of Stamford village the re
building of 78 rods was nearly com
pleted but stopped on account of
ground freezing. One third mile from
Readsboro line 5&'rod were built us
ing stone base. This' stretch had been
frequently washed out These' two lat
ter pieces of work were made possible
through generous donations i toward
their cost by Mr. W. B PJunkett: i!
, Sunderland r On the main Toad near
the' Bentley corner extensions were
made-both north and south from the
1914 work. A length! of 65 rods' was
built' h On the. old -thru pike lending to
Stratton four, pieces oC retaining wall
were built to protect the road from the
river, replacing former walla of log
cribbing which had washed or rotted
out. '
Windhall: Work done in previous
seasons in rebuilding the road from
Bondville toward Manchester was ex
tended 100 rods. The improved road
now extends to the Slado school, near
ly two-thirds of the distances from
Bondville to the Peru Turnpike.
The road leading from Windhall Hol
low towards Peru was added to the
list of state roads .late in 1914. State
aid improvement was begun this year.
The-work extends both ways from the
road Intersection near the Hall place
and ia.84 rods in length.' Width; 18
fee!. ' M
T;he road extending from Manchest
er; line to the Peru turnpike near the
tollrgate was widened and crowned
but-i not . surfaced. Length 165 ' roils,
width, 18 feet. v i ,n:!','
c Woodford: In connection with the
rebuilding of the lower bridge; near
Dunneville Hollow by the selectmen
15 rods of road was rebuilt.
At "The Rocks" near Bennington
lino a satisfactory removal of the
nearly stralghWaced ledge at the road
side, which formed such a serious
menace to traffic, was nearly complet
ed. A retaining wall was built to pre
vent the road from being gradually
undermined by the river. The old log
cribbing had been gone several years
and the road had been undercut by
the river so that the road shoulder had
begun to give way. The state paid
the entire cost. . '
In addition to the use of metal and
stone culverts, 17: concrete culverts
reinforced with steel and two of plain
concrete have been built in various
towns. The use of concrete is not nov
el in many of the towns but these
structures are of stronger construct
ion and more modern in type than
those generally built during the last
few years and are examples of what Is
now necessary in building to meet the
requirements of Increased loads and
permanency. ,
A law passed by the last Legisla
ture provides a small fund for assist
ing towns in building bridges of 4 to
30 feet span. Assistance has been
given in building three reinforced con
crete bridges, two in Stamford and
lone in Dorset.

her many friends, was the daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Morris Pal

born and brought up in Brooklyn.
She was married to Lester H,
Nichols of this place July 10, 1907
iney resided in Bennington one
year and went from here to Roches
ter, N. Y., living there for nearly
four years.
1 joined the 3rd Presbyterian church
or mat place, and sne was still
member there at the time of her
death. She was active in all branches
of church work and lead a large Sun
day school class of girls among whom
she did a splendid work for Christ
Mr. and Mrs. Nichols returned to
Bennington about three years ago.
Mrs. Nichols took an active part in
all the interests of the town and will
be a great loss to the community,
She was active in the Civic League

her strength to help the needy one.
For some time, she had suffered
from asthma and she had been con
fined to the house for a week with an
attack of the trouble which was not
thought to be serious until midnight
Monday evening. Then, she had a
sudden attack of heart failure and
paused away at 4:45 Tuesday mora-
in,

tack of asthma about a year previous
and seemed never to have fully re

WRECK AT MILFORD STATION Cf
Local Smashes Into Special and Both
Trains Are Then Sideswlped
By a Freight
New Haven, Conn., Feb. 22. Nine
persons were lulled and at fewest
sixty-five injured thU morning in a
wreck of three New Haven trains at
Indian River, two miles east of Mil-
ford Station, Conn., and eiht miles
west of New Haven, A west-bound
local passenger train crashed, into the
rear of a w est 'bound express stalled
ahead of it, and the two trains jump
ing from the rails were sideswlped by
a long freight train moving westward
on the adjacent track.
The exploding of the boiler of the
engine on the local train caused the
death of several. Of those Injured
eight are expected to die.
All three of the men who would bo
able to fully explain the wreck were
killed. They were the flagman of the
stalled express train, who had started
back to Btop the oncoming local and
the engineer and fireman of the local
train.
Some hours after the accident the
block signals were found set to stop
any train that might be approaching
behind the express, but if they were
so set, as they should have been
when the local ran toward the ex
press, the engineer of the local must
have failed to obey them.
The express train wrecked was

Bp'stori, which left New., liaveea t,en
minutes behind the express, and was
due in New York at 1.13 p. m. It was
crowded with pleasure seekers going
to Bridgeport and New York for
Washington's Blrthady.
Slightly more than 600 feet behind
the express train was a slight curve
in the track, and as Tourtelotte was
about to enter this curve, running
from the west, the local j train shot
around it from the east. ( According
to the position in which his body was
found and its condition, t)ie authori
ties agreed that he was struck by
locomotive of . the local train and In
stantly killed, . ,. ,. , , , ...
The .flagman dead, the local train
rushed on, driven by W. . R. ! Curtis,
Its engineer, and Edward! McGuIn-
pess, fireman. By the time the train
had." rounded the curve so that Curtis
could see the express train it was
too late for him to avoid the collision.
The . speed of the local, at the same
time has been . estimated - at forty
miles an hour. , Its momentum must
have been great, for when the engine
crashed Into a Pullman car of the ex
press both bodies rose from the
tracks and then bulged outward
against the freight train passim? at
the moment.
The freight was wrecked, but be
fore it was stopped the cars of tho
passenger trains were dragged,. over
turned and telescoped until moat of
them were crushed Into a mighty
mass c.f splintered wood and twisted
iron. The force of the collision
caused the boiler of the locomotive
on the local train to explode. 4 and
Bcaldlng water and steam were scat
tered in every direction. The boiler
was torn from the base of the engine
and hurled fifty feet into the air.
Most of those killed and injured were
in the local train.' The passengers
were In their seats when, without
warning, the cars suddenly stopped,
and every one pitched forward
violently. Almost every one . taken
to any. of the hospitals from this
train was suffering from severe cuts
and bruises about the mouth, and
many of them had lost all of their
front teeth In striking the seats in
front of them.
