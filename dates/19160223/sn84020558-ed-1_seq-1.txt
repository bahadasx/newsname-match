-The presence of Kmpcror Nicholas
at the opening of tlic ilnnia today is
iiaili'il liy the press anil public as one
of the most important events in the
whole piditieal history of Russia. It
is pointed out that thy appearance ot"
'he emperor in the house has empha
sized in the most striking manner the
increasing disposition of the goveru
incut and people to lay aside internal
polities and devote a'l their energy
to concerted effort, to bring the war
to a successful issue.
The event is referred to hy prom
iueiit members of the iluina as "the
beginning of a new era" and likened,
ir. its far reaching significance, to the
1 mancipation of the serfs ami the'
m-.eit'e1o of IMltT, 1

sian emperor h.nl ever visited the
legislative body or, in this formal way,
had recognized it as one of the parts
of the government. 't hears upon
;lie importance of the political crisis
through which Russia, has been pass
ing. Critics of the government have
protested that since the last adjourn
ment 1 if -the dtima the government has
not shown any increased tendency to
reflect the desires of the populace or
yield to the demands for internal re
lorin, and that a successful prosecu
tion of the war was impossible with
out some real understanding: bvtweeu
the government and the iluraa.
The emperor's presence today is
i,iln as a token of a n"W union of
the government and the popular re-j
views, toward which the Liberal and
Progressive elements in the duma
nave been s'riving, and will, it is
thought, relieve the tension and sus
pense that has existed since the ad
iournment of the house.
The session of the duma was opened
as usual with a half hour's prayer. 1
The emperor entered the chambe'.'j
promptly at 2 o'clock am
id
during
tn
relighnis ceremony stood
holy picture of Xicholas,
under the
the "won-
der worker."
About noon news that the duma was
to receive a visit from the emperor
was flashed through the chamber, but
the only preparation which indicated
that an eent unprecedented in the
annals of the duma was to take place
was a bright strip of carpet which
had hern laid in the hall, and the ap
pearance ot the Oolden Hook, which
is only brought out to record the
names of distinguished visitors. Many
of the deputies who returned from the
front to resume' their legislative, du
ties, still wore field uniforms. The
new premier, P.oris V. Stunner, who
succeeded M. (ioremykin in that office,
made hiH first address. He declined
that although Itussia did not minimize
the seriousness of the situation in the
duma and the sacrifices she was com
pelled to make, both the government
and the duma were resolved that
peace would not be made until Russia
had gained, in conjunction with her
allies, a decisive victory over the
tncmy.
"Russia had harrt'y begun the work
of internal organization," said M.
Kturmer, "when the war ir.terferreri. ;
Tint even ir. war time, this work musi i
go on. Russia's better future is com - j
ing; nothing can disturb our faith in:
lint. In the name of this future we
will not close our eves to our mis
takes and shortcomings, and we must
unite our forces. A new page in Pus
sian history is opened."
Th premier then spoke of the ne
cessity of reform to meet the new
economic conditions and of giving th
icople a greater hand in the govern- 1
ment. He said that the food problem
and the itiestion of freeing the coun
n y from German influence ought to
command special attention.

WASIlIXGTi . Feb. 22. James

vana, has been selected to act as
special agent of the state department
representing the Fnited States for
the Carranza defacto government
pending confirmation by the senate
of Henry 1'rather Fletcher as ambas

leave Havana immediately for Wash

It is understood that Consul .luhn

the overthrow of lluerta, will be

The decision to s'-nd the consul gen-

there- would be considerable delay in '

to a suggestion that the object of the
old policy, abandoned this year by the
bourd for the first time, was to keep
the American navy in second place.
While that was the effect it had, he
said, the real object was lo keep ahead
of Germany.
This year the board fixed as its pol
icy the creation by l:'2Ti of a fleet cu:it
lo the most powerful afloat at that
time. The committee did not go into
the board's .reasons for changing its
ideas beyond drawing out the explana
tion that the board believed a fleet ten
per cent superior to any fighting force
that might he brought against it would
be necessary to insure against the in-
vasion of American soil by an enemy.

A freight train, passing on another

j Washington was held, or if the Amer-
jicnn people were getting the Holiday
habit, as the Mexicans have it. Ib

Mayor Young, was as isual in a
jovial humor. He first called at

asked the audience how they liked
it. Several people in the rear of the
audience, replied in an enthusiastic,
affirmative, and the mayor expressed
his thanks. In speaking of" Washing
ton, the mayor leaned more towards
the unsuccessful side of the steal
patriot. He told of the gibes, insults,
jeers and calumny, which had been
