GOOD STRIKE MADE

LEASERS BRING IN ORE THAT IS
PEPPERED WITH PARTICLES
OF FREE GOLD
Uus Anderson and Tom Grimes, who
have a lease on a portion of the Wing
field and nrougher property at Gold
Mountain, five miles south of this city,
are In town today with samples of
quartz from their latest discovery.
Pieces of the brown quartz show tiny
speck of gold In profusion. An assay
across the bottom of the workings,
that was intended to be cold blooded,
gave $140 in gold.)
This discovery was made In a winze
that was sunk years ago. The people
who made the discovery asked for a
continuance of their lease, but were
refused and they kept their discovery
a secret. Later another leaser, not
knowing 'of the discovery, used the
winze as a dump and filled It with
waste. The latest lesser mucked out
the winze to extend It deeper and
found the rich quartz.

the Panama canal ana contracts have
been let for the clearing of 4,000 acres
of land In the vicinity of New Culebnt

excellent grazing for cattle.
The ranch will be used for fattening
cattle that have been purchased In
