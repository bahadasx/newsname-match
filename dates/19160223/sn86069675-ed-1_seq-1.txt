sive improvements in 'the shoo de

havo enrried for years thoy have
added the famous Nettleton shoo for

will central fairs be

i A meeting has been called by W.
Hoffman Wood, Secretary of tho
Montgomery County Fair Associa
tion to bo held in Winchester nt
tho Brown-Procloria Hotel on
Thursday, March 0th, nt 12 o'clock
noon, for tho purpose of effecting
an organization to hold a ten
weeks' circuit of fairs and trotting
meetings in Central Kentucky.
Much interest is being manifested
in the movement and, a good atten
dance is looked for. It is hoped to
have tho following cities in tho
circuit: Mt. Sterling, Winchester,
Berea, Danville, Lexington, George
town, Eminence, Snndors, Falmouth,
Grayson and Ashland, and the State
Fair at Louisville. An invitation
is extended to all of those who aro
interested in saddle and harness
horses, mules, jncks ponies, jen
nets, or any kind of show stock,
and trotters, pacers and running
horses to attend the meeting. It is
believed that tho circuit can be or
ganized with little effort and thnt
it will be worth thousands of dol
lars to the horse interests in Ken
tucky. Years ago this section of
the state was in tho old Blue Grass
Fair circuit and had some of tho

SEASON IS
. NEARLY OVER
Not a Great Deal of Tobacco
Left but All Houses are to
Remain Open.
Is
Although tho market is nearly
over, all the threo loose leaf houses
in this city will remain open and
continue to havo sales as long as
thcro is any tobacco coming in.
Something over seven million pounds
have been sold and it is thought
that Mt. Sterling will ugnin rank
third among the loose leaf markets
of tho state. Last year there was,
something over eleven million
pounds sold but tobacco did not
' weigh nnything like ns heavy this
year and all things considered the
market was satisfactory.
Wo heard no complaint as t
tho treatment received at uny of
the houses, everything being con
ducted in a high class, business like
manner. From tho last report ob
tained Mondny morning the three
houses have sold a total amount of
7,077,078 pounds for a total of
$74G,G02.78, a straight average for
the entire season of $10.54. The
snles aro divided as follows: Farm
ers' house, 3,278,838 pounds, aver
age $10.04; Whitehall, 2,G74,70a
pounds, average $10.50; Robertson,
1,124,140 pounds, average $10.8G.
SHOE STYLES
The stylo of your footwear thi
spring season is very important.
Every woman should pay marked
