??????
Senate Committee Decides
Favorably on Henry Prather
Fletcher's Nomination.
CHAIRMAN STONE TO SEEK
VOTE AT TODAY'S SESSION
. Messrs. Borah and Smith Against
Report Because of Opposition to
Recognizing Carranza.
Henry Prather Fletcher's nomination
as ambassador to Mexico
was ordered reported to the Sen^
ate today bv the foreign relations
committee with the recommendation
that it be confirmed as soon
as possible. Senator Borah and
Senator Smith of Michigan, republicans,
voted against the
recommendation.
t Chairman Stone will submit
the report in executive session
late today, and an effort will be
made to get an immediate vote
on confirmation. It mav be forced
over for a day under the rules, but
confirmation, in the opinion of
administration senators, is assured.
Senators Borah and Smith Opposed.
Senators Borah atid Smith opposed
the recommendation vigorously- on the
ground that the United States Senate
should not participate in recognition
of Gen. Carranza by confirming an ambassador.
None of the committee had any objection
to Mr. Fletcher, who now is
ambassador to Chile. Some of the senators
who were at first Inclined to
vote against confirmation changed
their view because they believed the
UJMted States should have a diplomatic
representative at the present stage of
affairs in Mexico.
Would Come to IT. S. First.
Pending Mr. Fletcher's confirmation.
James Linn Rodgers, consul general at
Havana, will act as a special agent of
the State Department, representing the
United States before the Carranza government.
His selection was decided
upon because of the delay in establishing
an ambassador to Mexico. Several
months will elapse before Mr. Fletcher,
now minister to Chile, can take up his
new duties, even if he is confirmed at
once, as he probably will come here for
conferences with President Wilson and
State Department officials and take a
short vacation.
Before assuming: his new duties Mr.
Rodgers will confer with the President
and Secretary Lansing. He is said to
be peculiarly fitted for the new post.
He is a native of Columbus. Ohio, and
has been in the consular service for
more than ten years.
Official State Department advices received
today, Secretary Lansing said,
clearly disproved reports that Gen.
Carranza practically had imprisoned
Gen. Obregon or that friendly relations
between them had been broken. Gen.
Obregon was reported to have left
Manzanillo for Mazatlan, en route to
Hermosillo to be married. Gen. Carranza
was said to be returning to the
interior from his visit to the west
coast.

TAMMANY FORESEES
A UNITED GIF.
V .
Political Writer Thinks Its
Leaders Also Expect Union
Among Democrats.
NEW YORK POST OFFICE
BIG FACTOR IN HARMONY
Patronage Problem Still Increases
Difficulties for Sweeping Indorsement
of President in New York.
Special Dispatch to The Star.
NEW YORK, February 23.?Post office
patronage would seem to have little
bearing on national issues and foreign
policies. But in order to get at the
democratic situation it is necessary iu
take the local viewpoint. And in the
local viewpoint the postmaster of New
York looms up big:. His selection may
not determine whether Tammany will
be merely regular or will be heartily
for President Wilson's re-election, yet
it enters into the calculation. The Manhattan
horizon is not a broad one.
I do not mean from this that the
Tarrynany leaders are entirely indifferent
as to the issues of the coming
campaign. They sum it up possibly
as acutely as people in Washington.
Their idea seems to be that peace and
prosperity or war and loyalty will
be the campaign catchwords, and that
either one should help their party
throughout the country.
Nor should it be supposed that the
local democratic leaders, outside of
Tammany, are indifferent to the force
of the issues as presented by Mr. Root.
Will J "D?
VY 111 i/CXCUU <E iCStUCUV 9 A Uiivivo.
A busy world may not tiave paused
to note that Dudley Field Malone, collector
of the port, was announced for
a reverberating trip through the west
to "answer Root." Moreover. It is
given out that when the democratic
state convention meets a week hence
ex-Gov. Martin H. Glynn will come to
the defense of the administration's
foreign policy and "answer Root."
Democratic senators, who have felt
that a pretty heavy burden was on
themselves in answering Root may.
therefore, feel some relief to know
that their task is lightened.
During a stay of several days I have
been at some pains to find out what
Tammany really thinks about the prospects.
The reply, in the first place, is
that Tammany thinks the democrats
will have to confront the united republicans.
Tammany politicians are very good
judges of popular movements. They
seem to be pretty well agreed in the
belief that the get-together impulse of
the republicans is so strong that no
self-seeking republican bosses and no
would-be leaders among the progressives
will be able to prevent it.
Tammany judges the popular impulse
as something that moves in a mass
and that will not be balked by individuals.
Tammany also believes that there is
a good prospect for a united democracy,
and, as an earnest of its own feeing,
is ready to give the President a sweeping
indorsement at the state convention next
week. But the prospect is not yet merging
into certainty. And there is where
the post office comes in and pushes foreign
policy into the background.
Tammany Calmness Disquieting.
The situation is a simple one. Postmaster
General Burleson, as the best
politican in the cabinet, decided that a
young man named Johnson, who came
out of the south and who was acceptable
to the organizaton. was the man
for postmaster Mr. Johnson had held
other political offices, having been graduated
into them from a newspaper. His
prospective selection, however, brought
out many protests from what calls itself
the better element.
Ths meant not simply the better element
emong regular democrats, but also
among independent voters who have been
supporting the Wilson administration. At
times his nomination has been reported
as on the way to the Senate, and at
other times as definitely eliminated. It
does not need much experience to realize
that the Poslmaser General, in one sense*
at least, was riht. Delay in making a
nomination has only increased the President's
difficulties.
Wary waiting is th#? attitude of Tammany.
U makes no threats, and sc. far
as I have been ahle to discover, shows
no irritation But its calmness is disquieting
to the democrats who are always
anxious to know whether Tammany
is going to be simply regular, or
whether it will show a real interest in
the election of a democratic President.
In the past there have been Tammany
leaders who have maintained that if they
could not ney recognition fro a democratic
national administration they were
better off under a republican administration.
This feeling receives some sup;
port at present when Tammany is comj
ing back- into its own. Its candidates for i
( local ornces were elected last November.
Moreover, there are unmistakable signs
that New York city is dropping back into
its old way. and after one term of a.
reform administration is likely to revert
to Tammany. This is no reflection on
Mayor Mitchel. it merely represents a
Manhattan habit.
Postmaster Perplexing Issue.
Whether Tammany will take deep offense
if the organization is not allowed
to have the postmaster cannot
yet be stated definitely. It is already
shown, however, that the better element
will feel hurt if Tammany is recognized.
What to do is perplexing.
The selection of a postmaster in itself
may not be vital, but the underlying
Question is.
This is whether an independent democracy.
free of Hammany, can be built
up. The aspiration is for what might
be called a high-brow democracy. It
is pointed out how such an organization
may he developed, since there is a
large element which is naturally democratic
and by tradition and inheritance
wants to he the democratic party
,.t Vnrlf
Many of the leaders among the highbrows
are from the south, and they
owe a good deal to Secretary McAdoo's
aggressiveness in securing them recognition.
But there are also many native.
New Yorkers and folks from other
states whose environment was democratic
and who want to continue democrats.
President Wilson in first grappling
with this patronage problem made
numerous compromises which satisfied
the high-brow element better than it
satisfied Tarn many. Now the question
is raised why the high-brows, for the
good of the party, cannot accept the
recognition of Tammany as the mugwumps
did under President Cleveland.
There is, however, a difference.
The mugwumps, because of their hatred
of Blaine, were willing to swallow
some bitter doses at the hands of
President Cleveland. But the high(Coo^nued

President Urged to Act in Case
of Men at Fort Leavenworth.
Serenaded by Boy Scouts.
)
Senators Kern, Lewis, Ransdell. Clapp
and HuRtin^a took up with President
Wilson today the cases of the Indianapolis
dynamiters who are serving sentence
at Fort Leavenworth and who
are said to be eligible to parole under
the federal parole law for good conduct
in prison. The parole board of the Department
of Justice has declined to
act upon the cases, it is said, and the '
friends of the prisoners think that an
injustice is being done those entitled
to parole.
The visiting senators told the President
that they thought the parole law
ought to be made effective in this
case, and the President said he would
obtain a statement of the matter from
the Attorney General. It is claimed
that fourteen of the twenty men still
serving sentence in Fort Leavenworth
have served beyond the period that
would entitle them to parole, and that
the prison officials ard favorable to I
paroles being granted.

With Secretary of State

COLUMBUS, Ohio. February 23.
Former United States Senator Theodore

Secretary of State Hildebrant his
formal announcement that he will be
a candidate for the republican nomination
for President, in connection with
la declaration of candidacy of William
Cooper Procter, Cincinnati manufacturer,
for delegate-at-large to the republican
convention.
The declaration of Mr. Procter was
accompanied by a statement of Senator
Burton giving permission for use of
his name. Mr. Procter, in accordance
with the Ohio primary law, declared
his first choice for the presidential
nomination is Senator Burton, but did
not indicate a second choice. This was
made impossible at this time, because
no other candidate for President on the
republican ticket has notified Secretary
of State Hildebrant of his candidacy.
This is the first statement of candidacy
for delegate at large on either
the democratic or republican tickets to
be filled with the secretary of state.
secretary Hildebrant directed that ,
the statement be accepted and placed
on file. According to his recent ruling'
it will not be necessary for Mr. Burton
to make any formal statement to permit
other delegates at large or by dis- 1
tricts to declare their first choice for
him. /

An unfavorable report on the

be opposed to the confirmation of Gen.
Smith's nomination, and with Senator
Martin one of the democrats, voting
with them, it will be impossible to obtain
a favorable report from the full
committee, for even if all the other
democrats voted in favor of Gen. Smith
the vote would be a tie. 7 to 7. It is I
believed, however, that at least one j
other democratic member of the com- i
mittee in addition to Senator Martin
will vote against Gen. Smith and that
the full committee will report unfavorably
upon the nomination.
All Ready to Vote.
The meeting of the subcommittee today
was very brief, the senators announcing
that they were ready to vote
almost immediately. After Senator
Phelan's motion to make a favorable j
rejfrort on the nomination had been
voted down. 3 to 2. Senator Jones then
moved to report adversely on the nomination,
and,this was. adopted, 3 to 2.
The subcommittee held extensive
hearings on the nomination of Gen.
Smith, which were, printed and before,
the subcommittee at the time of the
meeting today.
The fact that a Senate committee at
the last session of Congress investigated
the administration of the excise
laws in the District by the excise board
had reported adversely to hte Senate is !
expected to play an important part in i
the final vote on Gen. Smith, who was
chairman of the board at the time of j
the investigation and is chairman now. !
"DRY" BILL TO GIVE WAY
TO WATER POWER ITEMS
Senate Will Consider Myers and
Shields Measures Ahead of D. C.
Prohibition.
The Sheppard prohibition hill for the
District of Columbia will not he called
up for action in the Senate until after
the Myers water power bill has been
disposed of. it was said today by Sena
tor Sheppard. lhe .Myers bill has been
reported to the Senate an<l is expected
to come up for action after the Shields
dam site biiT"has been disposed of. The
Shields bill is the present unfinished
business of the Senate.
It has been understood generally
that Senator Sheppard expected to try
to get the prohibiaion bill up as soon
as the Shields bill was out of the way.
But Senator Sheppard explained today
that in making his announcement
he had said that he would call up the
prohibition bill after the water power
legislation had been disposed of. He
said that the Myers bill was included!
in this general term. It is believed
that the Myers bill will be under con-I
sideration for a long tin\e.
.Senator Sheppard said today:
"Of course, if the discussion of the!
water power bill drags along too long, j
an attempt may be made to get up the
District- prohibition bill before the
water power bill is finally acted upon."
GERMANY'S BUDGET GROWING, j
Privy Councilor Estimates Next j
One Will Reach 5.500.000,000 Marks i
BBRL1N. February 22, via London,
February 23.?Germany's next ordinary
budget, including 2,000,000,000 marks
interest on waulfans, will reach at
least 5.500,000.000 marks, according to
the estimate of Privy Councilor Behrnauer,
writing in the Hamburger Nachrichten.
The previous highest budget
?that of 1913-14?reached only slightly
above 3,500,000,000 marks.
As the receipts from customs and
other sources will show a sharp reduction,
Herr behrnauer reckons that the
fiscal year beginning in April will require
at least 3,000,000,000 marks of
new revenue for current expenditures
outside of the war. This is without
taking itito account new pensions and j
the increased cost of old age pension
system through the reduction of the |
age limit from seventy to sixty-five j
years, recently voted by the reichstag.

received you and ? privilege to have
seen so many of you upon such ati errand.
I want to say that so far as my
own feelings and opinion ?*are concerned,
this errand was unnecessary. I
have never myself doubted for a momerit
the "feeling that gentlemen such
as yourselves have toward America,
1 recognize you as just as much Americans
as anybody born in this1 country.

for whom they professed to speak, and
my public protests have been against
what they said and against their misrepresentations
of what I felt sure whi
the sentiment of the rank and tile of
those Americans born on the other side
of the water who have come and en-*
riched America by' giving her their*
talent and thei.r work and their al-\
legiance.
"So that I welcome this occasion as
an opportunity of expressing my unqualified
confidence in those thoughtful
citizens. like yourselves. who have
identified themselves in heart as well
i as in fortune with this great country
j which is sb dear to all of us. which is
! compounded of all of us aniV which
! does not belong to any one section or
portion of us. 1
I "1 have tried to show on various occasions
my passion for that equality
j which ought to obtain ajnongst all
those who profess allegiance to the
! United States.
"I feel highly complimented by this
visit, and--I will not say reassured because
T did not need the reassurance?
but very much cheered by the message
you have brought me. 1 thank you sincerely."
