H Wielder of Gun Attempts to Escape, Meets Officer Brown
H and Opens Fire, But Misses His Aim Policeman Shoots
H Twice, Each Time Hitting His Mark.
MM
James Bartholomew bartender at
the Western Bar, 166 Twenty-fifth
H street, and L. Martina,, a transient.
H are in the Dee hospital suffering of
B gunshot wounds of a serious nature
H as the result of a shooting affray
I which occurred shortly before 1
o'clock this afternoon. Bartholomeo
was shot by Martina and the latter
iecelved his wounds from a gun in
the hands of Patrolman William
Brown of the local police department,
with whom he engaged in a pistol
duel in attempting to escape.
A number of eye-witnesse of the
h duel between Martina anu -.e uffl-
H I cer, entirely exonerate the latter
H J from blame, in corroborative stories.
I I Saw the Quarrol.
H I Peter Vincent!, who was in the sa-
loon when the row started, heard an
Ir exchange of angry words between
Martina and a countryman drinking
at the bar, when Martina struck his
companion a blow in the face and re
; ceived In return a beer glass which
missed its mark and flew to pieced
on the floor The bartender rushed
to the two men and forced them out
the front door on to the sidewalk As
Bartholomeo started back in to the
saloon, Martina, standing near the
curb, pulled a gun and fired three
shots, two of which took effect and
. c one went wide of the mark and enter-
ed the woodwork at the side of the
' " door. Martina was not drunk, though
he had enough liquor to be mean and
resentful.
Crowd Shouted "Get Him!"
C. A. Marian! who was talking with
M. Lombardi in the Western Import
ing house next door, heard the shots
: and, rushing out, saw Martina act as
though uncertain which way to go and
finally made a dash west on the side
walk. Quite a crowd had gathered
and, seeing an officer coming from the
direction of the depot, the men shout
ed, "Get him!" At this Martina rais
his weapon which. he still carried In
his hand, and hastily fired at the po
liceman, the shot going wild. Officer
Brown pulled his gun and, at a dis
tance of about 20 feet nred twice, botL
j bullets taking effect.
Officer Was Quick.
(I E. J. .Nelson, an employe of the
V SIner Second Hand store, said he saw
I& the shooting of Bartholomeo and the
;( duel between Martina and Patrolman
Brown.
"I was across the street," he said,
"and saw Martina put out of the
Western Bar. He recovered his foot
ing and, as Bartholomeo was going
back Into the saloon, pulled a gun
from his pocket and fired three shots
at the bartender. He then turned.
' hesitated a little, and then started
i to run west on Twenty-fifth street.
Another Italian hollered, 'Hold him'
and just then Officer Brown came up
the street. Ab the officer came near,
Martina pulled the gun from his left
hand coat pocket and fired, the bul
let going high. Officer Brown, almost
; in the same second, fired twice and
the Italian fell to' the sidewalk,"

S59 "Twenty-fourth street; Charles
Adams, residing at the Lincoln house,
and M. B. Mizell, a local painter, wit
' nessed the duel between Martina and
I Patrolman Brown and their stories
I were similar to that told by Nelson,
i All were emphatic in their statements
j that Martina fired first at the offi-
I cer and that the latter's act of retalia-
tlon was in self defense.
I H Officer's Story.
Patrolman Brown in speaking of
I the shooting said:
j& "I was coming up Twenty-fifth
( street from the depot when I heard
shots fired. I increased my pace,
shifting my gun from my belt to the
outside pocket of my overcoat. Near
lng the Western Bar, I saw a man
coming toward me on a run. When
he was about 20 feet from me, I
shouted, Throw up your hands.' The
next, thing I saw, he had pulled his
gun on me and I fired. I don't know
whether he fired or not. I didn't have
j time to think.",
Detective Robert Chambers was the
f first officer on the scene from the.
police station, answering a telephone
call. He immediately called for the
I ambulance and the auto-patrol. Upon
. Ithe arrival of tho two machinos,
Bartholomeo was placed in the ambu-
lance and rushed to the Dee Memo

to police headquarters in the patrol,

Washington, Feb. 23 "The mili

times a large body or young men well

ting to the house today a favorable
report on his bill to establish and
maintain military training schools In
various states
The report said.
"Educate and train 4.S00 boys a

ing 100 a year in each stato. and in a
few years such would be the military
spirit created In all parts of thecoun
trv that a call for volunteers In times
of trouble would easily bring forth
one million men.
"Within a seven year period there
would be created a reserve of some
33,600 of the best trained men in this
county, or any other country, between
the ages of 20 and 32, who could be
law-fully required to respond, and in
stantly" to a call to arms"
Former Secretary Garrison had ap
proved the bill.
Battle Fleets For Canal.
Rear Admiral Badger of the navy
general board, told the house general
naval committee today that the Pana
ma canal had failed to solve the prob
lem of defending both the Atlantic
and Pacific coasts with one battle
fleet and that the defense of the Pa
cific coast would require a fleet there
able to dominate that ocean. At its
present strength, he said, the battle
fleet should be kept In the Atlantic as
a unit, and he added that the navy
general board never had suggested
that It be divided between the two
oceans.
Renresentativo Stephens of Califor
nia brought up the subject asking if
the admiral considered tho Pacific
coast adequately protected with one
obsolete battleship, a dozen cruisers,
most of them of the third class, nine
destroyers and three submarines In
fighting trim stationed there. Admir
al Badger said the assignment of
ships was a matter of departmental
policy, upon which he did not care to
pass judgment.
As to the Panama canal he said he
understood the present difficulty with
slides was expected to be overcome
soon, but he thought it questionable
whether the fighting fleet could cross
Into the Pacific within a year.
Mr. Stephenson asked If the policy
that the fleet should equal the strong
est afloat by 1925 had not been
evolved viewing the possibility that
It might ibe necessary to face two
enemies simultaneously, one In the
Pacific and one In Atlantic.
"I can answer that question," Ad
miral Badger baid, "but do not think
I should do so In open court."
Badger Against New Academy
Admiral Badger disapproved the
suggestion for a new naval academy
on the Pacific coast. Annapolis, he
Baid, could be Increased to supply all
necessary officers. He urged, how
ever, that at least fifty percent crews
be maintained on reserve ships.
Representative Britten asked If the
navy had not materially decreaso in
efficiency last year "because of our
Mexican policy." Admiral Badger
said not.
While it was a bad thing to have
the fleet withdrawn from the routine
of drills and maneuvers to stay at
Vera Cruz, the admiral said, it was
not serious and the ill effect was
quickly overcome.
Representative Hensley contended
that the training of military officers
might lead them to look with less
dread on the possibility of war.
"Of all the points, in the United
States, "Admiral Badger said, "one
is more opposed to war or anything
that would lead to war than the
officers of tho. army and navy."
