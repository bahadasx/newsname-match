OF SPRING
Week's Warm Weather Having Its
Effect on the River
Reports of Break-Up in Montana
and North Dakota
Signs of the river breaking up
were noticeable here Monday,
followed by the water overflowing
all the sandbars. There is now
rowing along both shores, while at
one point—almost under the tele
phone wire—the distance across
the ice is not. more than two to
three rods.
The river took a rise of a foot
or more the first of the week, and
now seems to be statianar}'
The Watertown Public Opinion
reports that the Yellowstone gorge
at Glendive went out Sunday, also
that the breakup of the Missouri
and Heart rivers is causing serious
gorges in the yiciuity of Mandan.
"First Mate" Forest Gates went
over to the Agency this (Wed.)a. m.
to resume his position on the fer
ryboat White Swan, which was
left in the water last fall. From
the way the river is raising, with
the warm weather we are having,
an early break-up is looked for.
Ilayre, Montana, a town on the
upper Missouri, is reported at the
Agency to be tinder water, caused
by the rapidly melting and deep
snow. The town is not a great
distance from Sup't Campbell's
home ranch
Among the first passengers
crossing the river by boat for the
season of 1916 was GeorgeComeau,
on Monday, by Earl Mosher's new
"packet" line. Others going over
at the same time were J.W. Walk
er, R03' Gates and Will Merrill
Earl Mosher is now carrying
U. S. mail across the river, com
mencing Monday, when the shore
water got over his rubber boot
tops.
Elfred Otto, one of the pupils
going to school in district No. 23
south of Forest City the other day
chased a coyote for about two
miles thru the deep snow and
finally ran it up to the school
house while school was still in ses
sion. With the assistance of a few
other pupils, the coyote was soon
numbered with the dead by the
use of an ax and a hayfork.

INDIANS WIN SUIT I
In an opiuion just tiled at Sioux
Falls. Judge Elliott, of the United
States district court, holds that
trust property of Indians is not
subject to taxation by the counties
or states in which it is located.
His decision is another victory
for the United States district at
torney's office and followed the ac-
.. ,,
TT
tion in the case of the .S.against
John Pearson, as treasurer, and
Calvin M. Smith as sheriff of
Devvev co, this state, on an injunc
tion and order to show cause in a
petition for a temporary restrain
ing order to restrain the collection
of taxes against trust property of
Indians on the Cheyenne River
reservation. The court determines
that all of the property assessed
against the Indians named in the
bill of complaint was issue proper
ty. or increase of issue property,
belonging to one of the classifica
tions endorsed in the opinion, and,
as such, an instrumentality used
bj- the government of the U.S. for
the benefit, of these Indian wards,
and not taxable for county or state
wards.
Judge Elliott's decision it is be
lieved will have far-reaehing
effect thruout the counties in
which Indian reservations are lo
cated and will become of import
ance as a precedent in other west
ern states. Sioux Falls Argus

CHA SCE OF A L/FJSTIME.
No ronnt.v in tb» west offers better
flacementa to-day to tbe farmer desiring
to build a home or to the capitalist look*
tag for a profitable investment for his
money than is offered in the fertile lands
of Potter county, South Dakota, which
can purchased av price* which art
pierely nominal when compared with leas
oroductive lands but a short diHtaoot
east. Here can be found railroads, school
houses, towns and villages ready built,
society organized and equal to that oi
the east on tbe one hand, and cheap fer
tilo lands on the other—a combination
impossible to find in a country either
older or newer than this. That this con*
dition cannot long remain is attested by
the fact that some of theshrewdest inres«
tors of the wast, conversant with tlM
value of su(b lands, art rapidly bqyii|
