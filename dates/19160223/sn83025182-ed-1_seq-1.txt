WASHINGTON. Feb. 23.—Brand
Whitlock for secretary of war to suc
ceed Lindley M. Garrison. This re
port was in circulation today. With
the white house mum, cpngress mani

ity. The gossip was that Colonel
House has been sounding out the
minister to Belgium regarding the
cabinet vacancy, it was said Presi
dent Wilson favored Whitlock for
many reasons. Whitlock's diplomatic
record, his personal popularity, un
questioned ability and "progressive"
democracy were elements cited In
his favor.
The appointment would be consid
ered in the nature of a reward for
Whitlock's service. In. Belgium. His
Influence upon congiess regarding the
preparedness program. It ,was also
conceded, would be considerable, be
cause of his actual experience in the
war zone.
Democratic leaders also declared
Whitlock would bring political, as
well as personal strength to the Wil

as mayor of Toledo, Ohio, along mod

Fletcher to Mexico.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.—Henry P.
Fletcher was today recommended for
confirmation as ambassador to Mexico
by 12 to 2 vote of the senate foreign
relations committee. Borah and Smith
were the opposing senators.
The action follows the president's
partial answer to Senator Fall's reso
lution asking for full information as
to the recognition of the Carranza gov
ernment anj its ability to restore
order. Borah and Smith based their
opposition on the contention that the
president in bis answer, withheld Im
portant Information from the senate.
The two senators will fight the con

Opposition to Brandeis.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.—Massing
their final attack on Louis D. Brand
eis, fifty-five Boston lawyers, through
their counsel, Austin G. Fox, today
preferred three new charges of
"double dealing" against the presi
dent's nominee for the supreme
bench:
These charges are: That in 1906
©rondels acted for a protective com
mittee of stockholders against of
ficers of the Equitable Life Insurance
Co., and that within nine months he
appeared for the company as opposed
to Geo! C. Peters, stockholder.
That he acted for attorney for &
Mr. Stewart against the officers of the
Gillette Safety Razor Co., alleging
mismanagement and that within a few
months he deserted these clients and
aided Gillette against them.
That he aided E. H. Harrlman to
gain control of the Illinois Central
from Stuyvesant. Fish in a deal which
caused Roosevelt to call Harriman an
undesirable citizen, rt was at this
time Brandeis was alleged to have
been attacking officers of the Boston
and Miaine railroad for the same prac

aided Harriman to p-«£orm with the

O. A. Weller. who has been west in

to enter his candidate in any primary
fights in the middle west. He found,
he said, that MJissouri had elected
two Week's delegates in convention
already and that it seemed decidedly

He returned through the southern
states and reports encouragement.,

Barnes report.
Many observers believe Barnes" ef

candidate.
Gossip among both progressive and
conservative republicans, is that for

Massachusetts
or former Senator Bur

LONDON. Feb. 23.—An Internation
al agreement for at least partial dis
armament may be possible If Prussian
"militarism" is destroyed by this war,
the Russian foreign minister, M. Sa
zonoff, declared In an Interview with
the Daily Ohronlcle's Petrograd cor
respondent.
"If Prussian militarism, that evil
thing which has darkened all our lives
for so many years, Is finally destroyed
as I most firmly believe It will be,"
said M. Sazonoff, "then I think some
measure of disarmament may be pos
sible. It should be quite possible, for
with England and Russia friends, the
rest of the world is safe.
"England, Franco and Russia are
responsible now for the future of
Europe, which is the future of civiliza
tion, the fate of the world. We can
and we shall destroy Prusslanism. It
may take a long time. We are pre
pared for that there will be no in
conclusive peace no peace with a
risk attached to It. Prussianism, which
Is a deadly poison, must be flung
clean out of the human .body. We
dare not leave It there to work onco
more for the destruction of nations."
The Chronicle's correspondent
pointed out that Scandinavians fear
and dislike Russia, believing that the
Slavs may some time invade their ter
ritory to obtain a warm water port.
This fear, he suggested, would be
greatly relieved, if it were known for

NEW YORK, Feb. 23.—The Prin

the folly of marrying the dapper
young Prince Miskinoff, many years
her junior, almost before their gay
honeymoon was ended, the prince tes
tified in his surt for separation today.
In Paris, he said, the princess re.
peatedly accused him of being in love
with her nfteen year foster daugh

Switzerland, she told him, he swore
today: "Oh why did I ever marry you
when I was so much older how much
better it wonld have been had you
married Yvonne."
On redirect examination, the prince
declared time and again that his love
for Yvonne was that of a father for
his daughter.
"I only kissed her hands," he said
emphatically, "but that was nothing.
I always kiss the hands of all the
ladies in the room."

PARIS, Feb. 23—The Germans
have launched a heavy offensive
around Verdun, from the right bank
of the Meu6e to the Herbe woods, the
war office announced this afternoon.
They are attacking with many Infan
try regiments on a fifteen mile front.
Entire German battalions have been
annihilated In the fierce struggle, ac
cording to German prisoners. The
French have evacuated Haumont for
est, but have reoccupied Caures wood,
which was evacuated yesterday.
Violent fighting also continues In
the Givenchy wood near Souchez. The
French have recaptured several of the
trenches occupied by the Germans in
their sudden offensive of Monday
night.
The violent onslaught of the crown
prince's army was preceded by a roll
ing fire of artillery that began Sunday
morning and continued throughout
Monday and Monday night. The
French replied vigorously to this bom
bardment and brought up reserves to
meet the expected attack.
Heavy German infantry attacks
were launched yesterday. The war
office admitted last night that by
practically vicious onslaughts the teu
tons had occupied the Haumont
woods and had broken the French
salient north of Beaumont, and about

said, was extremely jealous. There
was a long squabble over the intro

to admit them, but they were not
read at once.
"Leave it to me," he quoted her as
saying. "I know lots about getting
divorces -more than lawyers—be
cause I have been divorced twice."
The
prince is her fourth husband.
The prince said he does not know
the whereabouts of the baby he be

"Apparently this bill leases power

"but really the clause by which tho

Is not of the slightest value. So many
conditions and restrictions are placed
on the recapture of these sites that
people would tire of the effort. It is
specifically provided too, that the gov

of intangible values, including good

HAS ENGLAND BROKEN FAITH
WITH THE UNITED STATES?
New Question Raised in the
Submarine Warfare Dis
pute With Germany.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.—Whether
England has broken faith with the
United States in questions affecting
arming of merchantmen, was a novv
question raised today in the subma
rine warfare dispute with Germany.
Examination of state department
archives discosed a British pledge di
rectly on the Teutonic-American con
troversy. If officials believe this
pledge has been broken, protest to
England is probable. The British
promise was that England would not
permit merchantmen to take the of
fensive against submarines. Against
this, Germany is mailing copies of al
leged secret orders of the British ad
miralty to English merchant vessels
to sink submarines of the central
powers whenever possible and under
any conditions. August 25, 1914, Brit
ish Ambassador Spring-Rice wrote
Mr. Bryan, then secretary of state,
that he had been instructed by his
foreign office to give the United
States "the fullest assurances" that
British merchantmen would never be
used for purposes of attack and that
they would never fire unless Irst
fired upon.
ate warning Americans to keep off
armed merchantmen. The president
desires to avoid senate discussion.
Members of congress laid before
President Wilson today evidence that
a strong propaganda is under way
in congress to bring about legislation
desired by the German government.
i'he propaganda is seeking tho ac
complishment. of two tilings:
First—The stopping of shipment of
munitions and supplies from this gov
ernment lo the allies.
Second--Warning to Americans t.o
slay off any armed merchantmen or
liners.
Lobbying for these two measures Is
taking the form of a regular bom
bardment of letters, cards, pamphlets
and papi rs through the mail and
some work even on the floor of con
gress. Senators and congressmen who
called at. the white house today re
ported that during tho la»st week they
have received a vast amount of such
literature.
Tho latest propaganda circular, re
ceived at the c&pitol today, bore the
signature of Count Von Ferri, who
gave his residence 828 Twelfth street,
N. W. In addition to the circular out
lining tie claims of those opposed (c
munitions shipments, there were two
cards dealing with the same subject.
On one of these the statement was
made ihat while America complains
that 115 of her citizens were killed
by a single torpedo, hundreds
of Germans have been killed or maim
ed by a single shell shipped from this
country to the allies.

pearance of President Wilson hefor«

matic relations with Germany, was
forecast this afternoon by high admin
