PROVING PUZZLE
TO AUTHORITIES

signed "Jean Crones" which vas mail
ed at Portland, Ore., on Feb. 18, but
although the signature is similar to
that on other missives purporting to
come from Crones, the chief said he

written by Crones, as the misspelled
words did not resemble the words
and the meaning was not so clear as in

First Deputy SuperintendenS'of Police
Schuettler today, Crones, who attempt
ed the poisoning of the guests at the
recent banquet, had prepared soup
stock with five times the amount of
poison in it necessary to kill all the
guests. The appearance of the stock
after Crones left caused another em
ploye to throw away most of the stock,
leaving but one-fifth the amount
Crones had intended to give the
guests.

of the bureau of investigation depart
ment of Justice, today received a letter

Russ in War
IsDumaTalk
Petrograd, Feb. 22 (via London, Feb.
23, noon.) Addressing the duma to
day, Foreign Minister Sazonoff re
viewed the war situation optimistical
ly, although he declared it more diffi
cult now than ever to forsee the end
of the world struggle.
"The imperial government is un
shaken in its determination to con
tinue the struggle to conquer the en
emy," he said. "This war is the great
est crime of high treason against hu
manity. Those who provoked it bear
a heavy responsibility and today stand
entirely unmasked.
"We know who it was that let loose
the misfortunes without number with
which Europe is oppressed. Even Ger
man public opinion is beginning to re
alize that the German people ; have
been the dupes of those who thought
the hour had come to realize the
dreams of plunder and rapine they
had cherished so long."
M. Sazonoff, discussing Russian
American relations, said:
"The interest which American in
dustry has in our markets," he said,
"permit us to hope that in addition to
the friendly political relations now
existing between the two countries,
an economic rapproachement may be
brought about which would be of the
greatest benefit to both nations. In
any case, the Russian government will
put forth all its efforts to this end."
The foreign minister also referred
to "maladroit and importune propa
ganda of German agents in America,"
which he said "not only failed in its
object but provoked a certain irrita
tion and appreciably chilled American
sympathies for Germany."
In regard to Russia's relations with
Sweden, the foreign minister said:
"Our only sentiment toward the
Swedes is one of sincere friendship.
Any pretext of conflicting interests
could only be artificial. Russia's his
tory does not impel her towards the
coast of Scandinavia. She must ob
tain an outlet in a free sea in quite an
other direction."
M. Sazonoff then turned to Ruma
nia, saying:
"Rumania will not betray her own
interests and when the hour strikes
she will know how to realize her na
tional unity at the cost of her own
blood. She may be certain that in de
fending herself against the attempts of
a common enemy to interfere with the
independence of her decisions she will
find real support."
The Bpeech of Emperor Nicholas be
fore the duma was devoted principally
to the victory of the Russians at Er
zerum. "I rejoice that I am able to Join you
In thanksgiving for the brilliant vic
tory of our army of the Caucasus,"
the emperor said. "I pray for God's
blessing on your labors in this time
of trial and am convinced you will use
all your experience and knowledge and
be guided by love of your country in
the work for which you are responsi
ble to the country and to me."
Berlin, Feb. 23 (via wireless to Say
ville.) "At the meeting of
the duma," says the Overseas News
Agency, "members of the progressive
bloc (the coalition majority) rescinded
its former resolution insisting on all
the reforms proposed by it, and decid
ed to ask only for a cabinet composed
of men who enjoy the confidence of
the country.
"The progressive party, comprising
the right wing of the progressive bloc,
suggested that the platform of the
bloc ought to include a demand for a
parliamentary government with re

CALLS STATE TAX
SYSTEM SCHOOL
FOR DISHONESTY
Decatur, 111., Feb. 23. "The Illinois
tax system is a school for dishonesty,
with the state for a teacher and every
taxpayer a possible pupil," declared
George C. Gale of Galesburg in an ad
dress before the Illinois Farmers' In
stitute here today. "There is nothing
uniform or equal about the present
system. We are years behind the
times. The system is dishonest as well
"What incentive iflwman to keep
the soil at Its best if his tenure of the
land is likely to end at any time? And
what is there about the present system
of double taxation and undue burden
on real property to encourage a man
to set about buying land? The re
wards are still ample for the strong
and industrious, but the price of ad
vancement is higher than in many
other lines and it is small wonder that
some of the best boys on the farms
go to seek the wage of the cities."
Over 5,000 farmers are in attendance
at the institute. Professor H. W.
Mumford of the University of Illinois
told of the live stock situation in this
state. Other speakers of the day were
J. P. Gilbert of Carbondale, 111.; N. K.
Wilson of Philadelphia, Pa.; B. W.
Lovins of Windsor, Ont., and O. H.
Benson, representative of the United
