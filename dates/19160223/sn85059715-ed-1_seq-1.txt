i Police Search for Mabel Barnes
of Northview, Missing Since
Tuesday Night.
At every turn police wore today
baffled In their search for Miss Mabel
Rarnti nIra 21. who mvsterlOUBly dls
appeared from her home In Nortiivlew
Tuesday night. Members of the family
are unable to advance any reason
for the young woman's disappearance,
and police have been unable to And
a singlo clue as to her- whereabouts.
That the young woman la still In
' this vicinity was about the only tan,
glble clue that the officers had to
] work on. This conclusion Is drawn
from the statoment of members of
the Barnes ramlly thnt the mining
girl had no money with her when sho
left her home. Neither did she carry
-any clothing other than what she
wore, according to the police.
According to the story told police
by members of the Barnes family.
Vie young woman left her home at
A. OA fimoilnv Tlfffht without
JV.OV V uwvn * UVUUH^
saying anything to anyone about going
away. When It was discovered
that she was missing, members of the
family made a frantic effort to locate
her in Northvlew, but without avail.
The police of this city were asked to
aid in the search this morning and a
description of the missing girl was
given to every member of the force.
Chief H. L. Brooks and City Detective
L. U White were paying special
attention to the case.
Temporary Insanity was thought by
some to have cause the girl to leave
home under such mysterious circumstances,
and police officials seemed Inclined
to take this theory.
M. L. Barnes, father of the girl, was
In Clarksburg today, making an effort
to locate his daughter here. While
here he explained the case to the local
.police, and was promised that they
would aid him In every manner possible.
Mr. Barnes Is an employee of
the Clarksburg Light and Heat Company.
The missing girl waB described as
being 21 years of age, five feet, six

PARKER8B1IRO, Fob. 23.?That
tho Democratic stato niacltlno will I
not be satlatlcd to dlctato the nomlneoB
for their own party In llio Juno
primaries, but Is also attempting to
name the candidate# on tlio Itepiihll
fun tlckol has becorao known ronuwIng
tho meeting of the Democratic
Ute committee hero lust week.
For sevoral weeks n part of the
Democratic press has Riven more attention
to Republican candidates than
to those who are asplranlB on the
Democratic ticket anil Home of the
leaders of tho "Oolil DubI' combine
have been tho principal boosters for a
few of the nspirInK Itepnbllcnns. In
Borne of the side conferences held here
In connection with tho meeting of til#
Democratic commltteo the word was'
passod along to Domorrats throughout
tho Btate to use their influence
from now until the primaries for such
Republican candidates as the Democrats
bollove will be onslest defeated j
In the November election.
After Robinson. j
According to prominent Democrats
who wore In tho conference and who
havo received the tip, this organised j
fight Is to be waged principally
against Judge Ira Eh Kobinson, can-1
dldate for the Republican nomlnatlonl
for governor.
As a result Democrats can be heard
In dttferont parts of the stato rreoiy
predicting that Judge Hobinson cannot
win the nomination, but thnt Attorney
General Lilly has a big load
in the Republican rnco. In this matter,
the with is father to the thought.
It la not that the Democrats expect
to give any Ropubllcan candidate nsslstance
niter the primaries, but this
noiae Js being made In the hope of
creating an apparent band-wagon sentiment
tor Lilly, whom they want to
be nominated. They fear Judge Robinson's
candidacy knowing that his
nomination means a sweeping victory
for the Republicans In the general
election.
Press Active.
The Democratic press throughout
the state has taken up this light and
nearly every Democratic newspaper
Is boosting Lilly and opposing Robinson.
In these attempts to injure the
Robinson candidacy tho Democratic
press will stoop to any kind of misrepresentation.
The lifmocratlc editors
havo agreed to give freely ol
h.i. tnr thn tirade against tho
Taylor county candidate. For tlia
present they will push a campaign of
misrepresentation, as Is evidenced by
the false statements published this
week concerning meetings of Republicans
in McDowell and Kanawha
counties, wherein It la claimed thnt
Robinson will lose both counties In
the primaries, when as a matter ol
fact Judge Robinson on a visit here
Monday declared he is not worried In
the slightest about the returns from
those counties and thnt he will carry
each by a large mnjorlly.
Hlander and Abuse.
As soon as the Democratic leaders
see that a campaign of. misrepresentation
is of no effect and that the
Robinson candidacy continues to gatn
momentum, this campaign based on
false statements as to strength will
h? changed to one of slander and
