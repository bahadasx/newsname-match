USURY LAW
Bankers and Borrowers Alike in Danger of
Being Bitten, is Verdict Voiced Con
cerning Measure Enacted by
Special Session
COMPLY WITH IT TO
LETTER IS ADVICE
Harrison Declares Money Lenders Partly
to Blame; Interest Too High; Revul
sion of Sentiment and Repeal
of Act Predicted
Following the noonday recets the
members of Croup No. I of the Okla
homa Bankers' association reassembled
ut the Sticg theater yesterday after
noon to complete the business of tho
meeting,
Reports of committees were accept
vn and the committees discharged.
Tho "t'hury Law'' came in tor a
fcharo for the general discussion which
featured the afternoon session. Many
bankers present spoke upon the mat
ter, including the. newly elected offi
cers. The gist of the remarks of all
vho addressed the meeting, and the
lotise'isuH of opinion of all assembled
seem"d to be to ''take the medicine."
Different speaker?, while claiming
Giat the recently adopted measure had
"teeth" at the sharpest kind, were free
to admit that some, members of the
banking profeisl( n had been, to a great
ixtent, responsible for the measures
adopted.
Speaking along this line the former
secretary of the association, V. B.
Harrison, now of St, Louis, said, ' It
miit be admitted th.it some bankers
of Oklahoma lave had their sights
a little high -n the matter tf intere:it
thprgos on small loans. It Is up t
every banker of Ok'ahoma to take his
medicine.
If the nieafure proves, as we think j
It will prove, detrimental to the inter
ests' of the s.iiall borrower, the man
who needs $23, $.-., $73 or $100 for
'Ml nr.d CO days, then the demands of
the public will require the abolition
vt the measure by the next general
assembly of Oklahoma.
Harry Bagby of Oklahoma City, the
new secretary, spoke along the same
lines. The speaker Btated, briefly, that
there could be 'no question but there
vere two sides to the proposition. The
t mall banks had, he feared in too manv
im-taiices, rn.lHeil the sights fur long
distance Rams in making short time
nnd small amount loans The hank
ers as a whole were not tad fellows,
llry believed that in loaning money
for a i-.asonable compensation they
were aiding; in the development of the
community in which they transacted
business, jiiFt the same ai any rne els
might aid, in any other kind of busi
ness or vocation. In which dovolp
nient. The speaker urged the bank
ers not of the first division alone, but
of the entire state of Oklahoma, to
fee to it that the new law, when sign
ed by the governor and in full force
nnd effect, should be respected an
Complied with literally.
An Oklahoma City banker stated
that in his opinion the preeent measure
had been primarily Introduced as a
"simd bag" measure; that borne one
had "his hnd out" and thought the
bankers of the state might possibly get
together and ra'se a "means of de
fense" against' the measure; that he
had been "approached" by at least onj
member of the "late lamented" special
legislature.
Judge H. A. Walker of Oklahoma
City, Btated that It was his candid
nnd honest opinion that many mem
bers' of the recent extraordinary as
sembly did not know or realize the na
ture of the measure adopted.
C. H. Roardnun of Oklahoma City
urged all to observe the provisions of
the law. He stated that while the
measure had teeth by which the bank
er might be bitten, at tho same time
the same teeth wculd unfortunately
ibite the small borrower.
C. W. Howard of Frederick stated
that he had talked with bankers from
all sections of the state, particularly
the bankers who belong to group one
of the Oklahoma Thinkers' association,
and that ho found the consensus of
opinion to be to abide by tho meas
ures of the usury law to live up to
the letter ot the lavt .".We used to
have to take castor oil, we were told
to take it and like it. The directions
on this bottle says 'take it." "
Other members present at the after
noon session voiced similar senti
ments. All stated that they did not
believe the courts Bhould thresh on
the matter and teist the validity of
the law, but that the people who turn
ed to the banks of the country when
needing a few dollars for a few days
would and should be the court wmci
tried the case; that these would b)
the people who would be stricken the
hardest by the measure and that tho
clamor of public opinion would de
mand, when the next general assembly
of Oklahoma should assemble that the
measure adopted by the "recent ca
lamity" would be r?pealed.
The meeting proved a magnificent
t-uewss, both from a business and a
focial standpoint. Over 250 bankers
from the counties comprising "Group
One" were in attendanco, many of
them accompanied by their wives,
Bweethearts, their friends. Fully 20)
of those present registered.
Many of the bankers devoted a part
of the afternoon to taking in the city
of ChickasJia, attending the theater,
riding about the streets, over the miles
of paved roadways; taking short spins
to the country; driving out to tho
Country club and chasing tho festive
golf ball.
A vote of 'hsnki was tendered the
bankers of Chickasiia, and the general
public of the city, for tho most hos
pitable manner in which entertain
ment had been given. .
Mangum, the home of tho new chair,
man of group one, was unanimously
selected as the place where the next
meeting will be held.
Following the return to the citv
fiom the Oklahoma College for Wo
men many of the visitors, together
with their wives, assembled at the
Hol'.ingsworth hall and danced until
a late hour.
P. A. Jnneway of Mangum was
chosen chairman of group one, to servo

High Officials Predict President Will Ap

Teutonic Propaganda
By United Press.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 23. The
appearance cf President Wilson before
-ongrtE within the next few days to
announce his desire to break of.' dipl
matio relations with Germany was
forecast today by high administration
officials.
One of the officials paid this action
was certain tf intimations to the effeti;
that Germany is planning to further de
lav the settlement of the Lusitania
controverys are correct.
These intimations say the German
foreign offico is sending Ambassador
Bernstcrff instructions that wilt post
pone the termination of the Lusitania
negotiations.
Members of congress havu placed be
fore the president evidence of a strong
propaganda under way vo bring about
national legislation that is desired by
the Gorman government. This propa
ganda is seeking to stop the shipment
or munitions to the allies and to cause
warning to be issued to Americans
not to travel on armed merchant
men. It is declared that the lobbying for
these measures is taking the form of a
bombardment through the mail and
some work is even being done on the
floor cf congress.
A new question in tho submarine dis
pute has been raised as to whether
England has broken faith with the
United St.'.tes on questions affecting
armed merchantmen. Examination of
state department records discloses a
British pledge not to permit merchant
men to take the offensivi against the

College Girls Prepare and Serve Fine Feed
for Visitors, Giving "Correct Imita

BOOSTS INSTITUTION
Wykoff Declares 0. C. W. is Fulfdling
High Mission and Deserves Generous
Support at Hands of State;
Operetta Phases Crowd
Proceeding on the profound principle
that the "proof of the pudding is in tho
eating," President Austin of the Okla
homa College for Women, last night
demonstrated to a iarge company of
men and women from many sections
of the state that the institution over
which he presides is bearing down
strongly on the practical part of the
program entrusted to it.
The evidence that was presented to
the visitors was both ocular and gusta
tory, being in the sht.pe of a banquet
which gave a "correct imitation" of
the workings of the domestic scienca
department of the institution. ' In
keeping with the requirements ot
Washington Day, the dining hall of the
dormitory was gorgeously arrayed
in patriotic colors and the guests gazed
on a beautiful scene as they entered
and took their places at peifectly ap
pointed tables.
Be it known that the splendid six
course feed, to which fragrant cigars
were added as a finishing touch, was
prepared and served entirely by th3
studeits, according to announcement
made to the guests by Col. T. H. Dwy
er, the toastmaster. That it was a
success was evidenced by the rising
vote of thanks and chorua of applause
that was given to the girls and to Presi
dent Austin. ,
Owing to the limitations ot the time,
the speech-making program was short.,
President Austin gave the guests a few'
cordial words ot greeting, and Col
Dwyer paid a fine tribute to the college
and the man who is at the head of it.
Frank J. Wykoff of Oklahoma City,
who wa3 president of the first! bofd
of normal school regents in Oklahoma
territory, member of the A. & M. col
lege board for many years later and for
a time a member of the state board of
education, wa3 called upon by the
toastmaster and made a fine impromp
tu talk dealing with educational af
fairs in the state
Among other things. Mr. Wykoff
said, "If there are any institutions In
the state that are not needed, most
assuredly the college for women is not
one of them. If any of these institu
tions are fulfilling their mission, tho
woman's college is one of them. This
institution is to be cherished by the
people of this state and it deserves
to be supported by the legislature as
generously as any school in the state.
I have had opportunity to watch tho
work that is being done here and ac
cording to my thinking it is second in
importance to none that is being done
by any of our state schools. It is
teaching the young women of Okla
homa the art of home:making and do
mestic economy and thereby contribut
ing largely to solving some of the basic
problems in our national life."
Seated at the banquet were 1S3
guests, including the visiting bankers,
many of whom were accompanied by
ladies, and local bankers with mem
bers of their families. After the feast
vaf concluded the crowd proceeded
immediately to the auditorium of th
administration building, where the In
dian operetta, "The Feast ot the tteti
Corn," was presented under the direc
tion ot Miss Porter, head of the voice
department. Many town people were
present and the students received gen
erous applause throughout the enter
tainment. DEATH CF MRS. E. A. TAYLOR. '
