WINS CONFIDENCEOF THE SCHOOL BOYS
Meetings Each Evening at 7:30
Closing Friday Night of This
Week.
Large crowds attended the meet
ings being conducted by Dr. George
Ellingwood Joy in the Methodist Epis
copa1 church during this week. The
meetings began with a union service
on Sunday evening. The large audi
torium of the church was crowded to
its fullest capacity, and again on Mon
day night every available foot of
space was occupied. The interest
manifested by these two large audi
ences was very keen. On Sunday
evening Dr. Joy spoke on "The Call
of a Better Day." During his discus
sion he made an eloquent plea for
clean manhood among the boys of
today. The speaker is a young man,
full of life, and forceful. He holds
the attention of hds audience in a
most remarkable manner. On Mon
day evening Dr. Joy spoke on "The
Human Plant in the Home." Like on
the previous evening he held t'
closest attention of the vast audi
ence, while he presented many vital
truths and drove tliem home to his
hearers.
This evening Dr. Joy will speak on
"The Boy Problem as We Face It."
This address will undoubtedly prove
as interesting and instructive as the
addresses on Sunday and Monday
evenings. On Thursday evening he
wiLi talk on "The Art of Training by
Suggestion," and on Friday evening,
the closing of the series of lectures,
he will speak on "Success—The
Quest of the Human."
Dr. Joy comes here independent of
any bureau. The motive which
prompts him in this great wcrk is
that of inculcating into the minds of
the boys high ideals, and to aid par
ents and teachers into a better un
derstanding of the young mind. In
these respects he liis proven himself
a master of the situation. During
the week he works with the boys of
the seventh and eighth grades and
the High School, visiting the rooms'
and having heart to heart talks with
them.
While addressing the boys and
ijrouiig men of the school .,. be dis
cussed ^sufehimportant questions as
these: "The Master Mind
"Manhood's Power "The Adolescent
Boy "The Boy and His Ideals
"Formation of Friendships "Social
Ethics of the Young Man "Neces

"Knights of the Twentieth Cen

After operating for nearly fifteen
years, the Manchester & Oneida
Railway company had its first wreck
last Thursday morning. The drive
rod on the fireman's side of the en
gine broke, and proceeded to reduce
the engine cab into kindling wood.
William Acord, who was firing on the
morning run, was seated on that side
of the cab, and when things began
to look serious Mr. Acord decided
that his chances were more favor
able in the ditch along the rightof
way and he jumped from the engine.
In alighting on the frozen ground he
sustained a fractured ankle, and a
few minor injuries to his head. Mr.
Acord was taken to his home south
east of this city, where he is recov
ering from the injuries.

Alice Elizabeth Orvis was born in
DeKalb, Illinois, December 6th, 1861,
and when she was only six months
of age her parents moved to Dela

Here she grew to young womanhood.
On November 18th, 1880, she was
united in marriage with Mr. Allen
Barr, who at that time was also a
resident of Prairie township. For
many years after her marriage she
resided in Prairie township, she and
her husband coming to Manchester in
1903.
Mr. and Itfrs. Barr adopted one
son, Jay Barr. To this child by adop

There remain to mourn his depart
ure and to cherish his memory his
wife and seven children, fifteen
grandchildren, fourteen great grand
children, one sister, Mrs. Margaret
Cassidy ot Cleveland, Ohio, besides
other relatives and many friends.
Mr. McCormick was industrious and
honorable in business and gained a
competency. He had a firm trust in
God and faced the end without fear.
Those who knew him best are sure
that 't may be truly said of him
that "He looked for a city which
hath foundations, whose builder and
maker is God."
The memory of Mr. McCormick is
most precious to those who mourn
his loss. He was thoroughly unself
ish, kind hearted, and open handed.
He was beautifully free from all
worldly policy, a man sincere in his
convictions and whose convictions
could be read like an open book. He
had a profound faith in Jesus as the
only and all sufficient mediator be
tween God and man and a trusting
confident faith that beautifully un
folded and strengthened with the
years.
He often spoke of death and al
ways voiced the .thought that all was
we'l with him' in. his relationship with
God through Christ his Savior.
On the day of his death he again
spoke of his advanced age saying
that he had lived a long time on bor
rowed time and that he was ready to
go at any time- Many remarks that
he made during the day made one
feel that he realized that he was
about to "take that journey" to
which he so often referred and with
out a murmur or complaint he re
signed himself into the hands of his
Creator.

I want to tell you of a day spent iclosed
in London, to describe to you what
one sees as they walk the streets,
to present to you if possible, some
thing of the atmosphere of this cos

all the interests of the allies axe to

allies, in other words.
I cannot forbear inserting one par-
agraph in this article, pertaining to
our particular labors.
We have had to take a larger rooni
at our hotel, and have made it gay
with potted plants, and flags, and a
hired piano, for our room has become
liomp to scores oF. Belgian boys, as
well as many English Tommies, and
we keep open house. We have now
close to sixty Belgian soldiers
who are representing us at the front
in the distribution of Scriptures and
who report to us regularly. When
they come here on short leave, by
the kindness of the British Govern
ment, (but with no money in their
pockets, for their army pay is only
five cents a day), they come to us.
Some we keep at the hotel, others
we send out to another place kept
