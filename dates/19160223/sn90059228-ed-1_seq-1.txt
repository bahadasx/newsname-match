A LIVE TOPIC.
The Value of the Work of Our Farm
Boys Shown by G. N.
Morkassel.
/Patriotism, oratory and epicurean
j&ijoyment weie happily blended at
the tenth annual banquet of the War
ren Commercial Club, held at the
Masonic-K. Hall, on Washington's
Birthday. Like all former banquets,
this one also raised a little higher
the banner of co-operation, civic
pride and public spirit in our city and
some good is bound to result, not
only to Warren, but to all the coun
try tributary thereto.
The banquet was daintily served by
the ladies of the Eastern Star and
was of a kind that was sure to please
the most fastidious appetite. Too
much credit cannot be given to these
ladies for having prepared such a
royal feast, and they have the thanks
and appreciation of every member of
the club. The menu -was as follows*
Menu
Fruit Cocktail Veromques
Turkey Mashed Potatoes
Dressing Gravy
Jellied Ci'anberries
Creamed Carrots
Celery Pickles Olives
Rolls Rye Bread
Tunafish Salad Wafers
Ice Cream Assorted Cakes
Coffee
Candy Salted Nuts
In keeping with the patriotic spirit
of the day, the dining room was
tastily decorated with United States
flags, and small flags also waved
proudly over each dish of ice cream.
^\Each waiter also wore a unique head
in patriotic colors. Music Wo.t
-sw.irished between courses by the
Wan en orchestra, and Miss Nora
Bakke also favored the banqueters
by two songs.
After the feasting Judge A.
Grindeland took charge as toastmas
ter and made a few happy introduc
tory remarks before calling on the
speakers.
Mr G. N Morkassel was the first
speakei on the program His sub
ject was "What Our Boys Have
D-3e," and he handled it in a man
rf that made every member of the
Jr ub proud of the achievements of
""''the boys of Marshall county. Mr.
Morkassel said this was his maiden
speech, yet few speeches ever heard
in the club have been more interest
ing and encouraging, or contained
more food for thought, than his ad
dress on this occasion He spoke
eloquently of the great change that
has taken place in methods of farm
ing during the past 25 years and
alluded in a humorous vein to his own
experience in the early days when
ten "greenhorns" were gathered in a
bunk-house, as farm laborers, not
one of whom knew anything about
the intelligent cultivation of the soil,
and hardly knew how to harness a
horse. Plowing, seeding and in fact
all farm work was done in a careless,
shiftless manner, the main object
seeming to be to get a lot done and
finish as soon as possible. But the
old system of farming is gone for
N^jver. The schools, the press and thecontrast
^yvernment thru its agricultural de
partonent and various activities, have
I wrought a great change in farming
methods. The successful farmer of
today applies intelligence and scien
tific methods to his work. As an
object lesson showing what the
schools are doing to promote better
farming, Mr. Morkassel introduced
the two boys, Leroy Peterson and
Oscar Larson, who had won great
honors for themselves and the county,
the former in raising pigs and corn
and the latter in raising potatoes. In
another article this week is told about
what these boys have done in the
way of farming. Mr. Morkassel
**"rft"in4$stly omitted to mention his ownat
eon, Andy, who has done great things
as a boy farmer. Mr. Morkassel
closed by an eloquent appeal for re
cognition and encouragement of the
work of the boys, upon whom finally
the whole burden of feeding the naharvesting
tion will rest.
The next speaker was 0. H. Taral
seth, the president of the club. He
had been assigned to speak on Street
ImprovementHow, Where and Why,
a subject to which he has given a
gres" deal of thought and study. The
tin^i has arrived when Warren must
^something for the permanent im
'provements of its streets. Figures
were presented by Mr. Taralseth that

WARREN
O. H. Taralseth, President of Warren
Commercial Club.
proved conclusively the wastefulness
of present methods of caring for dirt
streets. He had written to different
cities and obtained figures of the
comparative cost of asphaltic con
crete pavement construction, oiled
streets, and gravelled streets. The
cost of asphaltic concrete construc
tion is from $1.60 to $1.90 per sq. yd.,
exclusive of cuibmg and cost of ex
cavation and is too expensive for us
to consider. Oiled streets are cheap
and in some localities are very satis
factory, depending on soil, drainage,
etc. The cost of oiled streets is
about $50 per block Oakes, N. D.,
has found oiled streets satisfactory.*
A number of towns in the vallev
among them Ada have gravelled
streets, and thev have pi oven both
durable and satisfactory. It requires
about 250 yds. of gravel per block
for a six inch road bed. making the
cost about 45 cents per front foot for
material exclusive of cost of excava
tion and spreading. A four inch road
bed lequiies about 165 yds. of gravpl
per block the cost of mateiial being
about 28 cents per front foot. Rough
ly estimated, about $300 will gravel
a block. He believed gravelled
streets were the most practical for
Warren. Mr. Taralseth had a lptter
fiom the Soo railray offering to haul
gravel from the gravel pits out east
at a low rate. Pride in our city as
well as the desire to eliminate present
wasteful methods should spiir us to
make these permanent improvements.
The matter will no doubt be taken
un by the citv council and steps
taken bv that bodv to imnrove the
streets along the lines suggested by
Mr Taralseth duung the coming
summer. Eveiv member of the club
was intensely interested in Mr. Tai*
alseth's practical and elucidating dis
cussion of the subject.
In the absence of E. Lundquist,
the former president of the club, who
was down on the program for a
the toastmaster called on Julius
J. Olson, who has just return
ed from a trip to Florida and,
Cuba, to relate some of his ex
periences on said trip. Mr. Olson
gave a very vivid and interesting
account of what he had seen in his
travels. In order to show the un
progressive character of the people
in the south he mentioned the fact
that during a short stay at Columbia,
the capital of South Carolina, he
had heard the legislature discuss the
question whether or not it should ap
propriate the small sum of $5,000 for
the teaching of agriculture in the
public schools of the state. When
one considers the agricultural pro
gress made by Minnesota, and the
generous appropriations of this state
for the teaching of agriculture, the
is most marked. He told of
his visit to St. Augustine, Florida,
the oldest town in the United States,
where may be seen old fortifications
and many relics from the Spanish oc
cupation. The old town with its nar
row streets and sidewalks is of great
historic interest Many relics from
the Seminole Indians, an aggressive
tribe that once dwelt in the state
may be seen, and in the cemeteries
may be seen the graves of many
S. soldiers who fell in the wars with
these Indians. He told about the
Flagler East Coast Railway system
and its magnificent hotels, where
prices range from $10 to $120 per
day. He always managed to put tip
more modest hotels. Titusville,
Okeechobee, Port Pierce, Miami
were in turn visited and interesting
facts told about each place. Miami
is a big shipping point for grape
fruit and oranges. Mr. Deering, the
machinery manufacturer,
owns a five million dollar winter
home here and W. J. Bryan also owns
a costly mansion, though only a Ford
car is found in his garage. Key
West smells fishy. The town has
many fish canning plants and cigar
factories. The trip on the railroad
built from island to island and ex
tending for 200 miles into the ocean
is very interesting. Havana is one
of the oldest cities in America. What
impressed him greatly was the beau
tiful water front, lined with a great
sea wall, buildings of handsome archi
tecture, boulevards, parks and artis
tic fountains. In Cuba, whites, blacks
and mixed bloods mingle and asso
ciate on terms of equality in marked
contrast to what exists in the south
ern states, where the blacks are held
of respect to the departed, a very
pretty custom. Mr| Olson thought.
He had visited Matanzas about 60
miles from Havana, and told about
the wonderful caves with their
strange crystal formations. When lit
up a cave presents a scene of great
beauty. The churches and cathedrals
in Havana are beautiful and full of
art treasures. The Cuban people are
hospitable and polite. Time and space
forbid a more extended mention of
Mr Olson's excellent travelogue. He
said the south is all right to visit in
the winter time by people needing
rest and recreation, but he could
never think of making his permanent
home there.
