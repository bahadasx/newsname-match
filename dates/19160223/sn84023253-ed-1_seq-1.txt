NOTED PITCHER COMING
Jean Debuc of The Detroit Americans
To Be Guest of F C. A. Thurs
day Evening.
Jean Debuc of Montreal, pitcher on
the Detroit American base ball team
has accepted an invitation to be the
guest of the F. C. A. at a banquet in
their hall tomorrow evening. The
club members are sparing no efforts
to make this event the most pleasant
in the history of the organization and
Mr Debuc's welcome is sure to be a
hearty one. Other guests of the eve
ning will be Rev. E. C. Drouhin, Rev.
J. A. Dame of Sheldon Springs, for
mer director of the club. Rev. C. A.
Pontbriand of Lyndonville, besides
several prominent St. Johnsbury men.
A short literary and musical program
will precede the banquet and the post
prandial will be in charge, of Dr. J.
A. Drouin, president of F. C. A.
Among those who "are expected to
speak are Father Drouhin. Father
Dame, Louis N. Smythe, Dr. W. B.
Fitch and Mr. Debuc
Jean Debuc, the guest of honor, was
born in St. Johnsbury in 1888 and
lived here four years when the family
moved to Burlington. His first base
ball experience was gained with the
St. Michael's college team and he also
played college base ball with Notre
Dame He broke into big company
with Cincinnati and before his ser
vices were secured by Detroit was a
member of the Buffalo, N. Y., and
Montreal teams. Debuc is known as
the -"slow ball wizard," having per
fected this system of delivery until he
is one of the most difficult in the big
game for batsmen to solve. His big
season with Detroit was In 1912 when
out of 20 games pitched in succession
he dropped the tenth. His batting
was also of a high order and he prov
ed the mainstay of the team that year.
At the conclusion of the season Presi
dent Navin refused an offer of $18,
000 for Debuc's release. That he is
still retained by the Tigers is proof
that he has not gone back.

BANKERS FOR FARMERS
State Association at Annual Meeting
Votes to Assist In Developement
of Agriculture
. That the bankers of Vermont are
fully alive to the ; importance of de
veloping the agriculture of the state
to a higher degree of efficiency was
clearly manifested at the annual meet
ing of the Vermont State Bankers as
sociation held here yesterday. In his
annual address Pres. H. M. McFar-
land urged it and by vote the associa
tion appropriated the sum of $100 to
be used by the newly appointed com
mittee on agriculture to expend in
starting an improvement movement
among the farmers of Vermont.
About 75 bank representatives were
present for the annual meeting and
spent the first part of the afternoon
visiting the scale works and other
ints of interest. At 4:30 the meet
ing was called to order in the Museum
and invocation offered by Rev. Alfred
Poole Grint. A cordial address of wel
come was given by Judge W. P. Smith
of St. Johnsbury and a response by H.
L. Ward of Burlington. This was fol
lowed by the president's address.
Pres. McFarland's Address.
In his annual address Pres. H. M.
McFarland of Hyde Park came out
strongly for investments by banks in
farm mortgages. He said that on
December 31 last 64 of the total
assets of Vermont savings institutions
"were invested in real estate mort
gages, very largely of the farm type.
He said in part:
In banking upon the farm mortgage
we are standing upon the greatest re
source of the country, the basis of all
prosperity, a resource in the hands of
the farmer that Is feeding and cloth
ing the people and producing billions
of new wealth every year. No security
for the people's money, which Saving
Bank deposits are, can be more logical
than the country's broad acres, none
safer.
This being true and In view of pres
ent agitation for some form of rum
credit enactment, it is especially fit
ting that we should briefly consider
the relations existing between the
banker and the farmer and his farm.
They are close, mutual and should te
reciprocal in other thanthe usual
way, the paying and the receiving in
terest. The slogan of the new religion is
co-operation. It is in the air. Co
operation not only between men do
ing the same business as between
banker and banker, farmer and farm
er, but between banker and farmer
and between man of all kinds of busi
ness. As another has said, not co
operation but inter-co-operation, ne
group of men acting for and with an
other group of men, having in view
not alone financial betterment but bet
ter and more sanitary homes, better
schools, better roads, improved social
conditions and that general uplift
which means a better civilization.
The farmer needs help and co-operation
such as this more than other
and greater facilities for borrowing
money. It is the unsuccessful man
who is complaining about his credit.
not the farmer grown successful un
der the touch of help that is helpful
not only to the raising of more and
better crops and better marketing. fa
cilities, but to better living for him
self and family and best of all to a
knowledge gained from experience
that his banker and his merchant are
his friends, ready and willing to help
him make of his farm the gold mine
it rightfully is, and of his home the
equal in comfort, sanitation and con
venience of his hitherto envied neigh
bor living in the city or village. He
has credit and to spare. He Is not
asking for federal aid. He is not
complaining. Rather he is rejoicing
that he and his family have come into
their own financially, socially and in
the enjoyment of the amenities of life.
This is the help that We Vermont
bankers are privileged to give to our
farmer friends, and we can do our
state no greater service than this.
Vermont is essentially an agricultural
state. Her prosperity is inseparably
connected with the prosperity of her
farmers. If they prosper, all prosper.
If they suffer or fail for any reason to
receive the maximum return for their
labors, it is a common loss. The weal
or woe of one is the weal or woe of
all. If we act from selfish motives
we will not withhold this help for it
will be the bread cast on the waters
to return after not many days, in
creased not one but four fold for ad
ded income for the farmer means ad
ded deposits for the banker and what
has been and is being done in Hamp
den county, Massachusetts, can be and
will be done in Vermont.
While we cannot expect immediate
results like those achieved in Hamp
den county, a beginning can be made
working independently, as many
banks throughout the country are do
ing, in the way of giving prizes to
boys and girls for meritorious effort,'
raising corn, growing pigs, cooking,
canning fruit and vegetables, or in
some other similar line of work or by
connecting ourselves with the county
or government agent working in our
vicinity. The important thing isthe
beginning. The beginning made, re
sults will surely follow for the work
is its own guaranty of continuance.
This work is at once our obligation
and our opportunity. What the farm
er needs, as I have already said, is
not more credit but help to greater
efficiency, to a better understanding
of the capabilities of himself and his

missioner. It is stated by Mr. Nel
son's triends that he is widely known
for character, ability, has a child in

candidate for publlc'office.
Papers were also filed Monday . eve
ning for T. J. Tierney for overseer of
the poor. Mr. Tierney was defeated
in the caucus but evidently proposes
to keep up the fight. This makes two
contests for town officers to be carried
into the town meeting and these with
the issues of the Perry Bill, license
and the primary doubtless will bring
out a large attendance of voters.

been issued and as can be seen in the
advertisement it contains 20 articles
to be acted upon by the voters.

approved of the idea and Is urging all
clubs to work toward making the week
stand for a spreading of helpful ideas
regarding the betterment of conditions
surrounding infants and children. In
town the clergymen have been asked
to speak at some time from their pul
pits on some phase of child welfare.
On March 9 Dr. Charles F. Dalton,
secretary of the state board of health,
of Burlington, will be in town to give
a public lecture on "Baby Hygiene."
Other notices-will appear next week at
to further plans for the week.

ELOQIIEHI SPEAKERS
Dr. Swadener and Ex-Gov. Patter
son Advocated State Wide
Prohibition at Rally
The largest audience yet out to hear
the state wide prohibition issue discus
sed gathered in the Colonial last Wed
nesday evening and heard two elo
quent and convincing addresses, one
by Dr. Madison Swadener of Indiana,
national lecturer of the Anti-Saloon
League of America, the other by Ex
Gov. Malcolm R. Patterson of Tennes
see. The audience was very enthus
iastic and evidenced its approval by
liberal .applause. One member in the
audience was the Hon. Olin Merrill of
Enosburg Falls who was in town on
business and was so pleased with the
speakers when they appeared in hip
village that he went to hear them
again.
F. H. Brooks presided at the meet
ing and spoke enthusiastically in favor
of the Perry Bill.
The first speaker of the evening,
Dr. Swadener, whose subject was
"How to Win National Prohibition,"
characterized the liquor traffic as un
desirable,' a liability- and a drain, and
said that for every dollar received by
the state or nation as revenue, two
dollars had been expended to pay for
the wreckage caused by such traffic.
He told in no unmistakable words the
ruining of his own boyhood's home by
liquor and of his determination to
fight, it until the last ditch was con
quored. The speaker then explained
the practical side of the situation in
the country at the present time with
regard to the fight against the liquor
traffic. Dr. Swadener then explained
how the national amendment was
necessary to make effective state leg
islation and how with the pfoper sup
port the fight could be concluded In
five years. The pledge cards for the
five-year campaign were then dis
tributed. Former Governor Malcolm R. Pat
terson then delivered an interesting
and eloquent address, explaining in
the beginning, his change of attitude
with regard to prohibition and de
nouncing the liquor traffic and the
American saloon as the most degrad
ed and most degrading influence in
American life today. The speaker
stated that he was not a reformed
drunkard, that he had drank, as had
most of the men with whom he had
been associated, but that with the en
tering Into his life of religion, his
drinking had ceased and his attitude
had so changed that he would rather
be a humble instrument to destroy
the liquor traffic than to hold the
highest office in the gift of the Amer
ican people. He told how the time
had passed when a man was respon
sible only for his own actions and of
the passing of the feeling that every
man could do as he pleased. A tell
ing point was made by the speaker

in his contrast of the states of Kansas
and Missouri, which lie side by side,
and in the . former of which prohibi
tion has been in force for many years
while high license laws have been in
effect in the latter. Kansas does not
owe a dollar of public debt, has one
hundred dollarp on deposit for every,
person within its borders, and one
farmer out of every five ownnn auto
mobile. In closing. Governor Patterson im
pressed on his hearers the fact that
the eyes of the nation would be on
Vermont at the coming election and
urged them to disregard the worn out
arguments of the liquor interests, to
vote for prohibition in Vermont and
thus forge a link in the chain of
states which would some day ratify
a national amendment for prohibition.
