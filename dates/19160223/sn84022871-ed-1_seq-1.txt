Methodist Episcopal Church Notes.
The subject of the morning sermon
was "Repairing Broken Walls." Text
found in Nehemiah 2, 17. The church
needs to be repaired along many lines
today. Some of the walls which hare
been broken down and are sadly jn
need of repairs at the present time are.
Respect for the Bible. The church
will never regain its former power
until there is a coming back to the
word of God. Respect for Sunday is
on a decline even among professed
Christiana Reverence for the sanctu
ary and divine worship needs attention.
Man has a n ture that needs God and
it is his duty to search after him
The atmosphere of the church should
be such that the spirit will flourish
in it. Where can you find a church
that you can truly call a praving
church? The church was born in a
prayer meeting but we have gotten a
long way from it "Another law which
has been tr ken town is faith. These
walls and others must be rebuilt if the
church is to measure up to its respon
sibilities and possibilities These can
be rebuilt, however, as each individual
builds them up in his own life, and
thus for the church as well.
The subject for the evening sermon
was "The Well at the Gate." We
were glad to welcome the Campfire
Girls who attended in a body.
Prayer meeting Thursday evening at
7.30.
Public Examinations.
Examinations for teachers will be
held in the graded school building in

THE TRAINING CLASS RECEPTION
On Monday evening, Feb. 14, the
training class of Barton academy rave
a reception to the high school in school
hall. A larger number of persons were
present than at any preceding reception
this year. The guests were received
by the president of the training class,
Miss Ernestine WiJlson, and by Mr.
and Mrs. Erwin. It was St. Valen
tine's day and the decorations of the
hall and the programs were of such a
nature as to suit the occasion. The
evening began with an excellent musi
cal program which consisted of the fol
lowing: A selection by the orchestra,
piano dut by Miss Eveleth and Miss
Willson, violin solo by Mildred Curtis,
song by a quartet from the training
class and a piano solo by Miss Ruggles.
The remainder of the evening was
spent in dancing and promenading.
Partners were secured for the grand
march by matching dissected hearts
and for each following march unique
favors were given. Much thought and
work must have been spent by the
members of the class in arranging such
an appropriate and pleasing program.
During the evening refreshments of
coffee and sandwiches were served to
the guests. At the close of tbe even
ing'the boys of the school showed their
appreciation of the good time they
had enjoyed by giving a rousing cheer
for the training class and Miss Patrick.
I think it would be safe to say that
everyone heartily endorsed their senti

DEATH THE
LEVELEFL
The glories of
our birth and
state
Are shadows, not substantial
things;
There is no armor against fate
Death lays his icy hand on
kings
Scepter and crown
Must tumble down,
And in the dust be equal made
With the poor crooked scythe
and spade.
. -
The garlands wither on your
brow;
Then boast no more your
mighty deeds.
Upon death's purple altar, now
See where the victor victim
bleeds!
All heads must come
To the cold tomb.
Only the actions of the just
Smell sweet and blossom in the
dust.
James Shirley.
