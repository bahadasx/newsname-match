MCKIE MERIWETHER.
Monument Erected in North
Augusta to Memory of He
ro Who Lost Life in
Hamburg Riot.
In the town of North Augusta,
in the centre of Calhoun square,
stands a massive granite shaft that
will be a silent tribute for many
generations to come to the brave
and patriotic young man, McKie
Meriwether, whose life was immo
lated on his country's altar in July
1876. He was 1 killed near the abut
ment of the bridge across the Sa
vannah by a bullet from a rifle in
the hands of a negro.
McKie Meriwether
That the memory of this brave
young son of Edgefield is thus to
be suitably perpetuated is due to ?
the lamented J. P. DeLaughter ]
whose very earnest and impassion- ,
ed appeal to the general assemblv ]
overcame partisan strife and secured j
an appropriation by the state which, (
supplemented by subscriptions from ,
individuals, made possible the erec
tion of the handsome monument, j
The time fixed for the unveiling .
exercises was Wednesday afternoon.
February 16, an appropriate pro- >
gram beiug arranged. The exercises
were held in the large auditorium
of the North Augusta high school '
whii'h is obliquely across the street
from the monument. The profound
interest which the people took in
the occasion was evidenced by the
large number of persons who as
sembled before the appointed hour,
representing Edgefield and Aiken
counties, also a large number from
Augusta being in attendance.
It was altogether fitting that Ex
Gov. John C. Sheppard, one of the
survivors of Wallace House and
one who in other ways rendered
valuable service in the trying days
of Reconstruction, should be made
chairman of the meeline:.
Upon rising to present the orator
of the occasion, Ex-Gov. Sheppard
spoke interestingly and at some
length of conditions as he saw
them in 1876. He said the legisla
ture was composed of 93 negroes,
18 carpet-baggers and 12 or 15 of
our own people. Members of the
body admitted publicly that they
had been bought. Prior to 1868 the
judges of South Carolina were
above suspicion, but between 1868
and 1876 justice was bought and
sold in South Carolina. The gov- .
ernor'8 home was at that period the
center of vulgarity and vice, and
the people of South Carolina were .
required to bear it at the point of
the sword drawn by the national
government. In 1872 and again iu \
1874 a white man ran for governor
and a negro for lieutenant govern- [
or. Mr. Sheppard stated that the ;
white people of South Carolinare- \
solved in 1876 that they would re- !
gain the government or there should
be no government in South Caroli
na. He said it was what took place ,
in Hamburg in July a?d in Edge
field in August 1876 that made
possible the election of Gen. Wade
Hampton governor. Recognizing
what the bravery of young McKie
Meriwether meant to South Caroli
na, the legislature took suitable
steps to perpetuate his memory.
Mr. Sheppard said it was peculiarly
fitting that one who was present
and took part in trouble at Ham
burg in July 1876 should have been
chosen to deliver the address on
this occasion, thereupon presenting
Hon. D. S. Henderson, to the large
audience.
Mr. Henderson said, ''McKie
Meriwether perished for the cause
of liberty ano! we are here to-r?ay t
perpetuate his memory and th
canse which he represented. His
family have always been public
spirited and patriotic. They 'fought
in the Revolution and down through
1876. As his flame of life was
quenched, he lit the flame of victo
ry for th?? white people of South
Carolina." Mr. Henderson next
paid a beautiful tribute to the
mented J. P. DeLaughter, who or
ganized the movement that resulted
in the monument and, said he, "bis
spirit is hovering over us this sa
cred afternoon " The speaker said
"The battle of Hamburg wan not
a massacre. It was a rebellion
against wrong, a Mow for the
right, an armed rebuke." He then
referred briefly to some of his pro
fessional experiences in 1876, when
one member of the supreme court
was a negro and that at least half
the juries of all the courts were ne
groes.
The speaker next read several
extracts taken from a book entitled,
"The Prostrate State," which was
written by (Ten. James S. Pike,
whom President Grant sent to
South Carolina to officially observe
conditions.
Gen. Pike sai i, in part, of con
dition in South Carolina under ne
gro and radical rule:
"It is the dregs of the population
habilitated in the robes of their in
telligent predecessors, and asset t
ing over them the rule of ignoiance
and corruption through the inexor
able machinery of a majority of
numbers. It is the barbarian over
whelming civilization by physical
force. It is the slave rioting in the
halls of his master, and putting
that master under his feet."
"The rule of South Carolina
should not be dignified with the
nam* of government. It is the in
.tallation of a buge system of
brigandage. The men who have had
it in control,and who now have it in
jontrol, are the picked villain* of
:he community. They are the high
waymen of the state. They are pro
fessional legislative robbers. They
?re men who have studied and
r>raeticed the art of legalized theft.
They are in no sense differrnt from,
>r better than, the men who fill the
ansons and penitentiaries of the
ivorld. They are, in fact, of pre
J. P. DeLaughter
jisely that class, only more daring
ind audacious. They pick your
pockets by law. Tliey rob the poor
md the rich alike, by law. They
3ontiscate your estate by law. They
io none of these things evtm under
the tyrant's plea of the public good
or the public necessity. They do all
?mply to enrich themselves per
sonally. The sole, base object is, to
gorge the individual wi'.h public
plunder. Having done it, they turn
around and buy immunity for their
acts by sharing their gain? with the
ignorant, pauperized, besotted
crowd who have chosen them to the
stations they fill, and which enable
them thus to rob and plunder."
Mr. Henderson made some refer
ence td the Ellenton riot and to the
valuable assistance that was ren
dered by the gallant John B. Gor
don and others from Georgia. The
latter part of this splendid address
referred principally to the New
South and the New South Carolina,
which is herewith reproduced in
pan:
'"The forty years which have
elapsed since then, politically speak
ing, have been exceedingly and
spasmodically interesting, if not
enlightening.
"South Carolina was the last of
the seceding states that emerged
i
I ;
'rom the war between the states,
ind the consequent attempts at re
jonstruction. and represented by her
*eal sons, took her place in the
New Nation, which was born from
he throes of that gigantic struggle,
md other similar troubles in other
southern states.
"The New Nation with the new
louth as a component part of it,
itands to-day in the front of the
lations of the world, for the pres
ervation of the world's civilization
ind enlightenment, and we should
?oneratulate ourselves that we have
-eached a period of real reconcilia
ron between the north and the
with, and that the partisan politics
?vhieh embittered the days of Re
sonstruction, and the decades there
ifter, have been assimilated in the
turmoil of national politics, where
'eal issues take the place of section
il hatred and passion.
"We have lived to see the day
when the negro, ceasing to be in
position to act as a tool for politi
cal charlatans, is satisfied cvith his
normal condition, as an equal of the
white man in the eye of the law,
but not his equal politically or so
cially.
"Wo have lived to see the day
when a southerner can stand up in
congress and claim the rights of
his section," on grounds common to
the entire nation; when a southern
er can even be president, or occu
py a place on the supreme court,
and be acceptable to all sections, if
he be a man of ability and charac
ter.
"We have arrived at the time
when in the Diplomatic affairs.of
the oountry our sons are called to
show their ability and -materia];
but we must remember in all of
this, that we too must put aside all
sectional ideas, and bring 'up our
sons to a full realization of their
responsibilities.
"However, all of this may be,
and however much we stand able,
and on the .same footing with all
Americans, we are all at the part
ing of the ways in many things.
No longer are we to be kept down
by the effete ideas bf the past in
niatters of government and control.
Education, in its livening influenc
es, touches the poor and the rich
alike, and the man who by proper
application and exertion, equips
himself, leads in the combat of ljfe.
"This Federal government ol
ours, because of its very immensity
in all departments, stands on a vol
cano all the time, because of the
unrest and uneasiness of its con
flicting interests, as represented by
its many peoples, but that same
public sentiment and love of coun
try which briners ns here to-day, is
the leaven which will leaven the en
tire governments
"Our obligations as a nation to
the other nations of the world are
growing more and more complex,
because of our ambition to spread
out, and take a part in the advance
ment of other people, and it is go
ing to take all of the Diplomacy
and statesmanship of which we are
capable, to keep us from the en
tanglements with foreign nations,
of which the great Washington
warned us.
"The multiform progress of
science in all of its promotions. The
new necessities and luxuries of liv
ing, which come from the new
phases of tho developments of our
vast resources, bring demands from
our people on the activities of our
government, state and federal,
which are alarming.
"The unrest and barbarous ten
dency of the curious people who live
in Mexico, have happily brought
about a -Pan-American feeling
among onr South American cousins,
which has inoculated the old Mon
roe doctrine with new phases, which
may require greater duties in guard
ing this hemisphere.
"The end of the European con
flict is not yet. No Sage can predict
the outcome, but whatevar it may
be, whether one side predominates
to the destruction of the other, or
they get weary of destruction of
life and property, and, revert to
their normal condition, we must be
ready as a people to act with dig
nity and importance.
"But out of it all, and through it
all, if we can keep alive the old pa
triotism and public spirit and en
thusiasm, which has marked us dis
tinctly as a people we can assimi
late the evils of progress and pro
mote the good that comes to us
from the increasing activities of
life, so that we-oan all rejoice in the
belief that there is "life in the old
land yet."
"Such occasions as this, such
reminiscences that come oat of the I
sentiments of snch hours of com
memoration and intercourse-such
inspirations of love of countrv and
of race, which we celebrate to-day,
are examples to the young: for the
future, and solace to the old for
nobler detds of the past.
The troublous days of the past
of which we have been speaking are
only in evidence now-a-days, that
we may be able to remedy our past
mistakes, and that we can with
more power and success enforce the
principles we acted upon in OUT
days of stress and turmoil. Enter
prise and developments are over
coming the nightmare and sudden
scare which came upon us in the
early days of the European struggle,
and we are b arning more and more
to trust ourselves, and go forward
in all developments with optimism.
"McKie Meriwether died, but his
spirit survives, to be applied to the
needs of oar busy life, \and our in
creasing responsibilities.
"The white man's Revolution of
1870 is numbered among the past
epochs of history, but its lessons
and experiences remain to be ap
plied to the perplexities and hopes
of American life and American am
bition in 1916."
The committee from the legisla
ture to present the monument on
behalf of South Carolina were
Senators Nicholson, William? and
Nickles, and Representatives Wil
liams, Toole and Brigham. Senator
B. E. Nicholson acted as spokes
man for the legislative committee
and presented the monument to the
city of North Augusta. He, too,
referred to the commendable efforts
of Mr. J. P. DeLaughter who took
the initiative in honoring the hero
of the Hamburg riot. Mr. Nichol
son spoke briefly but eloquently,
appealing to the city ofticials and
citizens of North Augusta to ac
cept this tribute in stone as a sa
cred trust and guard it with jeal
ous care.
Mr. James U. Jackson accepted
tho monument, ir behalf *f_..tbe
mayor and city council of North
Augusta.
This closed the exercises in the
school auditorium, which were ren
dered the more inspiring by pa
triotic choruses by the girls of the
high school and by music by the
orchestra engaged fori the occasion.
The audience repaired to Calhoun
square near by, where the monu
ment was unveiled in the presence
of a large thrung who stood with
uncovered heads. The unveiling
committee consisted of Mrs. W.
H. McCracken, Mrs. S. M. War
mek, Mrs. Jessie Crafton and Miss
Anna K. Butler, near relatives of
McKie Meriwether.
