A Small-Town Mayor on a Big-Town Job!
Seattle's big* opportunity right now is to elect Austin E. Grif
fiths its next mayor. Seattle has outgrown Hi Gill. Griffiths as
an executive, Griffiths as a leader, Griffiths AS A MAN, towers
head and shoulders over Hi Gill. * .
CfTwo years ago The Star supported Hi Gill for mayor as the lesser of two evils. Two years ago the election of Gill
meant the harmonizing of various warring factions in Seattle. Now the election of Gill means just the opposite. Gill,
as mayor again, means two years of do-nothing, of waste, of lost motion in council.
qGill offers the city nothing of a constructive nature. He depends solely on a corn-cob pipe
popularity. He offers only his quaint bald head. He has been in and out of city office 18 years.
He has never yet brought the city any lasting benefit. Gill is Gill—a 2 2-caliber man.
((The Star harbors no ill-feeling against Hi Gill. When he asked for a chance to redeem himself, It was The Star that -
helped him get It. But that is over now, and Seattle is a big, metropolitan city. It is not of corn-cob size. IT DOES
NOT NEED A SMALL-TOWN COMEDIAN IN THE MAYOR'S CHAIR.
<fThe Star is for Griffiths for mayor because The Star believes Griffiths' election will be for
the best interests of Seattle—for the best interests of all the interests of Seattle. The Star is
for Griffiths because HE IS A MAN. His election will mean progress. His election will mean
the ending of the city hall wrangling. His election will mean we will have a real executive
in the mayor's chair. HIS ELECTION WILL MEAN A SQUARE DEAL FOR SEATTLE.

CAMERA MAN
BEING SOUGHT
After an unsuccessful all night vigil, deputy sheriffs re
doubled their effort* Wednesday to take into custody the al
leged leader of blackmailers who, with headquarters here, are
said to have "badgered" the most prominent and wealthy men
of the Pacific coast out of thousands of dollars during the
past two years.

who is saiil to have worked in collusion with a firm of attor
neys and a score of attractive young women in getting photo
graphs of victims in compromising situations.
All Tuesday night Deputy Sheriffs Brewer, Madden and
McCiillivray lay concealed near Ins home, watching every en
trance. but without success.
According to Deputy M. K. Hally, whose investigations
led to exposure of the alleged "badger" game, the financial
agent i- the man who operated the camera in almost every
instance, and who developed the negatives which were sold
for fabulous sums to the victims.
Word was received by Sheriff Hodge from Los Angeles
today that Miss Isabel Clayburg, arrested in that city by
Sheriff ("line yesterday as an alleged member of the syndicate,
