Petrograd, Feb. 2$. Addressing the
Soma today, ;Foterlttn Minister Sazon
ott reviewed the war situation In wu
no itIinTstl6 way, although he de
clared it was more difficult now than
ever before to foresee the end of the
world struggle. - - - .
""The Imperial government remains
unshaken in its determination to con
tinue the struggle to conquer -the ene
my,'' he said. "This war is the great
est crime, of high treason against hu
manity. " -Those who- provoke it bear
a heavy responsibility and today stand
entirely unmasked. We known ;whb
it was that; let loose - the- misfortunes
without number witli which Europe is
oppressed." .Even German public opin
ion is. beginning. to. realize that, the
German people hits -been the "dupe of
those who thought the hour had come
to realize' th dreams of plunder and
rapine theyihad cherished so long.
"When dealing with: an enemy like
Germany we - must take thought in
good time how best" to prevent the
repetition of the events which occurred
eo,' rapidly , 18 months ago. The "in
stinct of self -preservation' n demands
putting an end to the ruthless egoism
and passion for plunder jwhich are the
distinctive characteristics of Prussian
ism and must be crushed, once for alL
Otherwise, sacrifices of the allies will
be vain. . . . . , -
"The allies have brought s about a
complete union without the sacrifice
by anyone of them of a particle of in
dependence or personality. With the
enemy it isl different. Germany's .1
lies have become vassals. It is hard
to speak -any longer o Austria-Hungary,
Turkey and Bulgaria as inde
pendent states. The clutching grasp
of Germany has seized the power in
her armies and all branches of admin
istration. "
The speech of Emperor Nicholas be
fore the Duma was devoted princi
pality to the victory of the Russians
at Erzerum. i
. "I rejoice ' that I am able to join
you in thanksgiving for the brilliant
victory of our army of the Caeausus,"
the Emperor said. "I am happy to be
among the representatives . of my
"faithful people. I . pray for God's
blessing on your labors in this time of
trial, and am convinced you will use
all your,experlenee and knowledge and
be' guided by love of your country In
the work for which you are responsi
ble to the country and to me. I wish
you a fruitful labor and complete success.

Ansonia, Feb. 23 The striking la
borers of the American Brass Co. to
day refused to accept the compromise
offer of the company for a settlement
of the strike which began here ,a
week ago, involving more than 3,000
men in . the brass, wire and copper
mills of the. company and decided to
stand out for. their, original demands
of an increase of five cents an hour.
' This decision, reached after a pro-'
longed session tiday In which the
company's latest offer amounting ap
proximately to a 10 per cent, advance,
was discussed, came-as a surprise as
the belief had been- freely expressed
throughout the city;and by company
officials that the close of ' the day
would see an end of the trouble.
The strikers take the position that
the company's compromise off er shows
they have the battle three-quarters
won,, their chances -Jfor complete vic
tory are good, - ; M . . '
After this action ; h&d . been voted
the strikers formed ' a complete po
licing organization . of their own with
a commissioner, chief, captains, lieu-,
tenants, sergeaiits and privates for the
purpose,- it was' announced, of picket

It was -not '.Joseph M Grohol, the

It' is not understood, however, ' that
he . had been replaced in authority.
The men will be paid off tonigh't at
the main, offices of the company so
as to keep them out of the shops. As
soon as each man receives his enyelL
ope, it ' is -said, . he will by order of
those in- charge of the strike, take it
unopened to hi pommitteeman ' who
will . examine f? to see that no. addi

an inducement o . the. striker to DreaK

$300; which shQ claimed had not been
paid in September, 1915, as agreed.
Budlong said he had already paid her
over $5,000 in ' alimony whereas it was
stipulated when she obtained a divorce
in 1906 that she was to receive only
$2,000. .Instead" of paying a lump" sum
Budlong agreed to pay her $75 a. month

Budlong alleged in his counter-claim
that she promised to release him
from the $2,000 judgment when the
monthly : alimony agreement was
signed and it was upon this ground
that he asked the court to order his
former wife to return all alimony in
excess of $2,000. In the demurrer coun

Elm street, Stamford, formerly .em
ployed in - the Yale & Towns fac
tory, 1 but until yesterday," morning
working as an electrician at the
Stamf ordt roundhouse was made at
the Nettleton morgue, Milford by
Mrs." Sweeney this morning.
.In the identification made by a
ring bearing' .the initials "H. S." the
mystery of f the third man in the
engine cab of train No. 5 was cleared
up and the t fact that the body first
believed by 'railroad men to be that
of- McGninnees, fireman on Nov. 5,
was. really that of Sweeney was es-tablishjed.-.
- , v
Sweeney", died instantly from a
compound fracture on the crown of
his head. He was "dead-heading"
on the engine of Curtis who has been
a companion and bosom, friend of
Sweeney for a number of years. It
was through,. the.eff orts of Curtis
that Sweeney h-bee employed .by.
the Railroad omny.junilyeaterday
luuriuuis, .
A most unusual series of circum
stances and a prophesy of fatality
yesterday was disclosed by. . Mrs.
Sweeney, a pretty, woman or 21
years; who survives with a one
month' old baby, haying been married
April 29, 1815.
In- detailing : the -incidents' of the
day before Mrs. Sweeney , .told a
Farmer reporter after her identifica
tion of the body:
.--"My ' husband "was born ' in Dan
bury, 21 years, ago. His father was
Thomas Sweeney who(. now - lives with
us in Stamford. . For a while my. hus
band worked in the Yale & Towne
shops earning $2.50 a' day. , He
wanked to be a moving picture operator-and
a - short while ago went to
Hartford to. get a - license. He was
always a great friend of Engineer
Curtis and it was through his persua
sion that "my husband consented to
work in the Stamford roundhouses in
order that' he mifeht be promoted to
be a -fireman on -one of the engines.
"He went to work at the Stamford
roundhouse -yesterday morning. He
came back to .the house at 6:15. a. ni.
' 'Throwing up both hands as he
came into the " room with- me, -he
said r.i 'I've chucked up the . Job in
the round house. . ' .
-; "I pleaded with him to keep it and
he said: '.'.";'' .
. " 'Don't" worry, I'm going- to- get a
good Job. today,', and our r baby Ruth
Evelyn, -is . only . one month old yes
terday. An odd coincidence is that
his mother was only, buried a year ago
yesterday. : '.We were planning to dec
orate her grave on Sunday. . .
s "At midnight last night his father
cwme home. I thought that it was
Ha.rry coming in. "Is Harry Home?
his father , said. - I answered. 'No.
; VHis . father . said, 'Well, - you will
.probably - never; see. him- again . as ,1
have, been told he was in the wreck.
"Harry , was vei'y nervous .yesterday
morning, i He seemed, to fear some
thing indefinable. - As if something
was -going to happen. ,
"My brother, Frederick . Radcliffe,
wanted Harry to work for him as a
painter. Harry could not see that
for .'he wanted to -be in the moving
picture business.
"Yesterday was also the 22nd an
niversary of his parents' marriage and
the 4 3rd anniversary of the marriage
of his grandmother. We were talk
ing about that in the morning. My
young brother, Alfred, was - killed on
the railroad Just . east of the South
NorwaBc.- railroad station when he
w.as struck by a train, December 4,
1911. He was going to the store for
his mother. Anothes-''coincidence is
that the day was the tenth annivers
ary of his sister Anna's birthday. His
uncle Benjamin Parson is also author -
ity for the statement that one of his
sisters died Just a . year ago yester
day. - "It. is peculiar, that ali day yester
day I had a fear .that a vision of hi3
dead mother -. would appear before
me.v This thing haunted me all day.
We had made all arrangements to
decorate her grave in Danbury .next
Sunday."
Mrs. Sweeney, who came here from
Rowayton, Conn., is a pretty girl. She
was. dressed in a blue serge suit with
fur collar.- . , ". ;
They were married at Rowayton af
ter they had met a year ago, July 4, In
Stamford, although they had known
each other from infancy. Sweeney's
life was insured.
Mrs. George L. Ulley, Mr. and Mrs
Richard Forester , and son of Water

L. T. Rockwell at the Algonquin club

CURTIS HERtTDF
FREIGHT ShIASH
FIVE YEARS AGO
In commenting upon the past per
formances of Engineer Curtis, railroad
men today state that his record has
been good, and that this was shown
In 1911 when four freight trains were
in collision at Fairfield. . .At this time
Curtis is said to ' have had charge
of a freight that w6uld have done
unlimited damage to property had it
not been for his . presence- of mind
In applying the emergency brakes.
Everyone who knows him in Bridge
port speak highly of his character
and reputation on the railroad.
. A report that he was in charge of
a train Which nearly went . into tne
Housatonic river last March through
failure to observe signals, was disr
proved, today when the records show
another engineer was in ; charge.

New Haven, Feb. 23 Determined to sift to the bottom the j
question of responsibility for the wreck at Indian River, Mil
ford, the Interstate Commerce Commission prepared today for
an investigation in the Yellow Building of the New Haven road's,
headquarters.
While the inquiry was begun in executive session, it was
an open secret about the corridors of the big building that one
of the vital questions which the commission will seek to deter- I
mine 'definitely is whether or not the New Haven road engineers I
have been accustomed, of late, to run past signals,, with official !
sanction. ' ;
" That engineers have been doing this, acting under the au
Ihority conferrpd by a "close-in" order, since the recent con
gestion of freight made conditions on the New Haven lines
highly unsettled, was one of the numerous steri'es that unoffi
cially , reached the investigators of the Interstate Cpmmerce
Commission. r
To sift 'to the bottom this vital matter is one of the chief'
aims of the inquisitors. . . !
That Engineer Curtis, if he were authorized to run past
signals by special order, could notave seen at a distance the
llagman Because ol the presence ot the ireight train in the
curved section of tracks was ah important factor in the inves
tigation.
Railroad officials hd members of
the Connecticut public utilities com
mission ; conducted separate informal
inquiries today while ' Coroner Eli Mix
held' his behind closed doors, as is his
custom, declining to give out any in
formation at this time. Mr. Mix had
before him Engineer John J. Kennedy.
and Fireman Charles Courtz, of Train
79, who were on the ground under the
first coach of their train trying to lo
cate trouble in the air hose from the
electric motor to the coach. Neither
was seriously .hurt. Several Milford
men who were among the first on the
scene of the crash were also witnesses.
The Say's dev.'ppments ns to the
cansei,f the-' collision were few. The
railroad company, through Vice-President
, Whaley, issued a statement to
the effectV that : the . signals in the Mil
ford iblock were properly set against
Train' No. . 5, -and that the brakes on
this train were in perfect shape. No
reference; Is made to the "condition of
the brakes on the engine of this train.
A statement on the' wreck issued
today by A. R. .Whaley, vice-president
in charge of operations, said the sig
