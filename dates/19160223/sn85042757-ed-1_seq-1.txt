COMMENDATION AND COMMENT
A Chronicle Reader Agrees With Miss
Barnes and Gives a Thought
or Two.
The following letter is self explana
tory and we feel sure will be read with
much interest by Chronicle readers
over this county especially, because the
writer is well known to many here,
and for the further reason that he
speaks in sympathy with our people.
Day ton, Tenn., Feb. 18, 1916.
Mr. S. C. Bishop,
Crossville, Tenn.
Dear Sir:
You are right in saying the article
by Miss Barnes on the "Question of
Preparedess, ' which appeared in the
Chronicle this week, is worth reading
and will meet with the hearty approval
Of home loving and patriotic people
everywhere. I candidly believe the
article exprccoes the opinion and senti
ments of nine-tenths of our best citi
zens toaay, who have given the ques
tion any careful consideration.
Why are we m such a great hurry to
get ready for war now? Are we in any
more danger of being attacked by any
of the European powers now than we
were before the beginning of the pres
ent war? We heard very little in gen
eral about "preparedness" then. 1 am
of the opinion that Europe has about
all she can attend to now at home in
the way of "scrapping.' And when
the war is ended, she will have learned
the folly and costliness ot "scrapping"
and it will be several years before sne
is able or even wants to tight again.
War vessei- that we build now, by
that time would be ready lor the junk
pile.
Why complain about the militarism
of Germany, and talk about the dan
gerous naval strength of England,
while our enthusiasts are running up
and down the country planning to have
our Nation surpass either one of tnem
in this respect.
As a Nation I wonder why we are so
hypocritical. . If we are anxious for
the war to close, why do we furnish
ttae belligerents with munitions to
carry it on indefinitely? Does it not
appear to the average thinking man
that we are more interested in furnish
ing war supplies at high figures, than
we are in peace? I am made to won
der how high our Sunday prayers for
peace ascend on an average.
1 note what you say relative to the
fight being waged against Newell San
ders for National Committeeman. You
are right again. Sanders and Hooper
are the ablest and cleanest leaders the
Republican party ever had in the state.
They must not be thrown overboard
now, if they are, the party will suffer
for it. J am jglad you take the posi
tion you do in the matter, as well as
the position you have taken all along
in regard to this European war.
If you pardon me for this letter 1
promise not to do so again. With best
wishes for you and the Chronicle, I
beg to remain
Yours truly,
John Rose.
(Mr. Rose need offer no apology for
his letter for what he says, especially
relative to Newell Sanders, meets with
the hearty approval cf fully ninety per
cent of the republican voters in this
county.
Mr. Rose was born and raised in this
county and has all his life lived with
and labored as one of the ' common
people" of whom Abraham Lincoln
used to speak of so often; hence his
utterances must be taken as coming
from the intelligent masses and tor
that reason if no other, are worthy ot
a careful and respectful hearing, which
they certainly will receive in this coun
ty. Editor Chronicle.)
STATE COMMITTEE CALLED.
Chairman L. D. Hill has called the
democratic state executive committee
to meet at the Maxweil House, Nash
ville, February 26, next Saturday, to
determine the time and manner of se
lecting delegates to the national con
vention that convenes in St. Louis,
June 14, and to determine the date for
the gubernatorial convention.
TREATY RAT1FED.
Last week the United States senate
ratified the t.eaty with Nicaragua
whereby this government gets a
ninety-nine year lease on the canal
route across Nicaragua and a naval
base in the Gulf of Fonseca for three
millions of dollars.
That means this country has control
of all possible routes tor a canal con
necting the Atlantic and Pacific in
Central America.
MURDER
SECOND
DEGREE IN RUSH CASE
Lightness of Punishment Great Surprise
to the Public; Was Due to Failure
to Understand Meaning of
Word 'Premeditated."
WILL BE TRIED FOR MURDER
OF MRS. MABEL RUSH
Also May Have to Answer for Burning
Rush Home, But Will Not Come
Up This Term. Plea tor New
Trial Heard Today.
The jury in the Rush murder case ar
rived at a verdict Saturday night about
nine o'clock. Judge Snodgrass bad
them brought into the court room,
where he had gone promptly on being
notified that the jury was ready to re
port, and asked the foreman, J. A.
Tulley, if they were ready to report.
Mr. Tulley replied in the affirmative
and stated that a verdict of murder in
the second d. Tee had been reached.
The verdi( I proved to be a surprise
to Judge Sr.ii grass as it was to the
general pubi; . The jury was dismiss
ed anH allow, d to go home. The ac
cused, Victc Hu h, was present when
the verdict wa imported and seemed
to take the teiUii very lightly. After
returning to li.c cell in jail he laugh-
ingly told one ot the other prisoners
that the jury had given him a sentence
ot ninety-nine years.
The argument tor a new trial will be
heard by Judge Snodgrass today. In
the event a new trial is denied the case
will likely be appealed to the supreme
court.
CANNOT BE HANGED.
At the sitting of the last legislature
a law was passed abolishing capital
punishment, which precludes the possi
bility of hanging had the verdict been
for murder in the first degree.
The legislature of 1913 did away with
the old custom of allowing the jury to
fix the term of imprisonment and pass
ed an indeterminate sentence law.
which will give Rush a sentence in the
penitentiary ot from ten to twenty
years. The law acts automatically and
does not require that the judge or jury
either shall fix the length of time. It
will only be necessary for Judge Snod
grass to sentence Rush to the peniten
tiary for the indeterminate term fixed
by law for second degree murder,
which is from ten to twenty years.
Should Kush be sent up for that time
and should he prove to be quiet and
well behaved he would be allowed what
is known as "good time," which would
reduce his term by such number of
months each year as the state board of
pardons may direct.
HOW VERDICT WAS REACHED.
There has been much speculation as
to how the jury could reach a verdict
of second degree murder undert he evi
dence, which was generally regarded
as being very strong.
It seems that some of tne jurors
could not agree as to just what the
word "premeditated" meant as touch
ing the case. After considerable dis
cussion a dictionary was sent for and
the meaning sought there. Taking the
dictionary meaning and the charge ot
the judge, as some of the jury urged
its meaning to be, the feeling seemed
to become almost general that second
degree murder was the proper verdict.
There was no doubt expressed oy any
of the jurors as to the guilt of Rush,
but as to the magnitude of the crime.
The defense labored under very ad
verse conditions from the start because
the evidence seemed very strong
against Rush and they could find no
really logical grounds on which to base
a theory that would justify acquittal.
The attorneys for the defense are ac
credited with agruing the case as well,
perhaps as conditions would
I finujji' no vvuuikiviia nuuiu 1'L I HI 1 I,
J he attorneys tor Kush were: E.G.
Tollett, S. N. Smith and F. B. Mc
Elwee, Rockwood.
The attorneys, tor the state had the
whiohand from the start and argued
their case with splendid effect. It has
bf en repeatedly stated to the writer
that no stronger or more able argument
was ever presented at this bar than
was made by the prosecution. J. R.
Mitchell opened the argument ot the
state and made a speech full of elo
quence, logic and invective that must
have carried great weutht with the
jury, if the way it effected the public
may be taken as a parallel. II will
long be remembered by those who
heard it as being one of the most pow
erful and convincing arguments ever
presented at this bar.
C. E. Reyes was the second speaker
for the state. While Mr. Keyes is not
regarded as an orator he does bear the
reputation ot being able to apply the
law to a case with great force and
clearness. On this occasion he is said
to have surpassed everv previous effort
in that way.
Judge G. P. Burnett closed the argu
ment for the state. He went deeply
into the human side of ttie case while
applying the evidence with eloquent
firce and stinging sarcasm. He pre
sented the cruelty and viciousness of
the crime with telling effect while
touching strongly on the pathetic. All
n all his argument was a most telling
one.
Victor Rush will bi tried for the
murder of Mabel Rush, the wife of
Will Rush. The indictment has been
found but the case will not be tried
before next term of court. While no
indictment has been found for burning
the house there Is no probability that
such an indictment could not be found
and that may be done later if the state
should not decide that previous ver
dicts are sufficiently severe. As to
that, however, time alone w ill tell.
Constab Ad Hyder hal the jury in
charge and vr-both tSHhafrJind at
tentive and nothing was done or al
lowed by him that would make possible
an opening for setting aside the ver
dict so far as his part was concerned.

WORLD'S LARGEST TELESCOPE.
Los Angeles. Calif. -Preparations
were made recently to freight up the
steep trail of Mount Wilson, a huge
sectional telescope tube which, with
the largest lens in the world, will be
installed at the Carnegia Solar obser
vatory. The tube arrived here from
New York. Its sections, which with
their cases, weigh 47,250 pounds, were
refused by railroads for shipment be
cause they were too wide for flat cars
and too high to go through some trans
continental tunnels, so they came bv
steamer around the Horn.
Work on the lens, which weighs four
and a half tons, has been in progress
several years. It will be completed
next year.

SWEET CLOVER.
Great Humus and Nitrogen Gatherer and
Next to Alfalfa as a Feed
The growing of Sweet Clover in this
county is interesting several of our
most wide-awake farmers. In order to
give those who know nothing about it
some definite information we here re
produce some facts as set out in a lit
tle book published by the International
Harvester company. The title of the
book is "Sweet Clover no Longer a
Despised Weed a Valuable Crop."
The books can be had by sending five
cents to the International Harvester
Company, Chicago. Following are
some interesting points taken from the
book mentioned :
"It is an excellent crop to prepare
the land for alfalfa in heavy, hard and
poor soils.
"Its roots being softer than alfalfa,
sweet clover becomes inoculated more
readily than alfalfa.
"It does not stool as much as alfalfa.
The shoots start, from the main stem
and on this account the mowing ma
chine should be set as high as possible,
so as to leave plenty of small shoots to
start the next crop.
"It will not bloat cattle or sheep.
This is one of its chief advantages over
the other clovers. It is a great milk
producer.
"Ground intended for alfalfa will be
greatly benehted by previously seeding
one and preferably two years to sweet
clover, as it inoculates the soil for al
falfa. "It is avalunble cepp in rotation be
cause its roots decay very raDidly, ad
ding much humus to the soil and fur
nishing much plant food.
"It is customary to turn stock on the
sweet clover in the early spring, when
it is young. There being no other
green feed they will soon become ac
customed to it and like it.
"It is a great soil enriching crop. A
great many of the experiments con
ducted to ascertain its beneficial effects
prove that it is one of the greatest
crops we have for the soil.
"It is rich in feeding value. It con
tains more protein than red clover and
equally as muc has alfalfa.
"It will grow on land too wet or on
land loo dry for alfalfa or red clover.
"It grows more rapidly than alfalfa
when young, produces a good crop the
hrst year, and provid6s early green
pasture.
"It will stand more alkali or more
acid in the soil than alfalfa or red clo
ver and produce a crop.
"It thrives where rainfall is heaviest
and where rainfall is too light to pro
duce many other crops.
"It needs a firm solid seed bed. The
ground should not be loose, many of
its failures on cultivated land have
been due to a loose mellow seed bed.
"It seeds freely in humid as well as
in dry sections.
"It will grow in many of the Sout-h
ern States where red clover tails.
"it makes an excellent green ma
nure. It grows best on soil containing
plenty of lime.
"Perhaps one of the greatest advan
tages of sweet clover is its ability to
thrive on almost any type of soil and
under almost any climatic conditions.
"It should not be allowed to stand
too long, as it becomes woody and loses
its leaves, it should be cut when 18 to
20 inches high and before it blossoms,
if it is to be used for hay.
"It is a weed in waste places only.
It never damages cultivated crops.
"It is almost impossible to kill out
by over-pasturing, but very easy to
eradicate by proper cutlivation.
"As a soil builder it is excellent, for
every two years the old plants die,
leaving holes 8 to 20 inches deep and
1-4 to 1-2 inch in diameter, filled with
fibrous roots which permit the water to
enter the subsoil.
"It is a biennial, completing its
growth the second year and then dy
ing. Under favorable conditions it
may reach a growth ot from five to
twelve feet the second year.
A FEW DON TS.
"Don't plow deep.
"Don't sow deep.
"Don't cat low in mowing at least
6 inches high.
"Don t have subsoil loose.
"Don't be afraid to sow sweet clo
ver. "Don't plant the yellow annual
sweet clover, lhe white is better. '
We know ot no person in this county
who has attempteo to grow sweet
clover, except J. B. Johnson and he
seemed to fall into the common error
of thinking it would do no good because
it grew so slowly at the start and he
plowed it up. A few of the plants es
caped being destroyed and some oi
them had grown to oe seven feet high
when seen by editor of the Chronicle.
Sweet clover grows very slowly at
hrst but is making root while showing
such slow t vidence of growth. As the
plants become a little older and after
sufficient root has been formed the top
then grows very rapidly.
From the very large amount ot hu
mus sweet clover puts into the soil our
people shou'd give it a very careful
test, for it is without doubt a great
soil builder as well as nitrogen gath
erer.
A few people have decided to give
sweet clover a test this year and Reed
& Burnett have ordered seed and will
be prepared to supply those who wish
to give it a test.
WEDOING ANNIVERSARY.
Observed by Mr. and Mrs. And) Elmore
Last Thursday.
One of the most brilliant social
ail an s of the season was the reception
at the beautiful home ot Mr. and Mrs.
Andy ElmoreThursday afternoon from
three to six, celebrating their thirtieth
wedding anniversary.
About 150 friends called .luring the
afternoon to extend congratulation.
They were welcomed at the door by
rs. Pearle F. Keyes, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Elmore, and received in the
library by the bride and groom and
others of the receiving line. Mrs. J.
T. Horn then escorted them to the din
ing room, where a delicious buffet
luncheon was served. The serving
table was beautiful with its center
piece of pink roses, and was presided
over by Mrs. J. B. Johnson and Miss
Fannie DeGoIia, assisted by Misses
Bessie Potter, Daisy Molen and Eula
Bishop. The menu consisted of chick
en salad, wafers, cheeBe straws,
pickles, Spanish cream, cakes, coffee
and mints. The coffee was served by ,
Misses Vivian Dunbar and Antoinette
Jackson. Punch was served through
out the afternoon by Misses Mildred
Burnett and Gladys Comstock.
In the living room the many beauti
ful gifts of silver, cut glass, pearl and
china were displayed. The rooms were
beautifully decorated with palms, ferns
and cut flowers, pink carnations and
roses being used.
Several friends were invited for the
evening which was spent in a .is,
dancmg and music.
The generous hospitality and broad
neighborly kindness of Mr. and Mrs.
Elmore have won for them a very
warm place in the hearts ot our peo
ple, which rendered the anniversary an
occasion of unusual interest and pleas
ure. The numerous gifts bore with
them more than the usual feelings of
esteem and good will.
All in all the event was one of unus
ual pleasure to those so fortunate as to
be present and will long be remem
bered as one of the bright spots in the
social life of our town.
HANS SCHMIDT ELECTROCUTED.
Hans Schmidt, the priest who mur
dered Anna Amuller Sept. 2, 1913, was
electrocuted in Sing Sing prison, New
York, Friday last.
Schmidt murdered the girl and then

them into the Hudson river from a
ferry boat.
WAR SITUATION.
The Russians have taken a Turk
stronghold in which 80,000 Turk bo)
diers were fighting, but neatly all the
troops escaped before the place was
surrendered. Many guns and much
ammunition were a part of the booty.
The Russians are still pressing the
Turks hard and may yet capture many
more.
Fighting on the western front ha."
been lively for some days and on the
whole the Germans have gained more
ground than they bave lost. Tbere
have been numerous battles in tbe air
in which all parties have suffered some
loss, bit the Germans seem to have
gotten the worst ot it
