goveriimeni Jhrongli the Marquis
of I.alisdow tie, ii ll ll oil need lu the
bouse of lords tonight Hull it had de
cided lo turn over all mutters, con
nected with Ihe blockade of Oermuny
to one man who would rank ns a full
Hedged cabinet minister. R is un
derstood that the new post will go
to Lord Robert Cecil, who since tlm
lormalloii of the coalition govern
ment has been undor-seerelary for
foreign affairs. Ho will retnln thin
post. Joining Ihe cabinet a hlockado
minister.
The now minister will ho charged
with the. administration of the orders
in council regulating the blockade,
jus well as responsibility for tlm gon

(Veil a Yoinm Mull,
i I.oid Robert Cecil Is a lawyer of

members of the llrltlsh cabinet go. In
I the foreign office he hiis born Inli

, In i il.iih lo the complicated , mutter
j touching bclllgeretil and neutral
rights. His elevation tu the cabinet

lining, Baron .Sydenham and Huron
! Beresford making the principal np
I penis for n stricter blockude, whllo
jthe Marquis of I.aiisilowne and Huron
Buckmastcr defended tho govern
ment. '
It was Huron Uerosford's maiden
speech in thu house of lords and his
plea was spirited and epigrammatic,
contrasting- notably with the usual
sombre ullra-dlgnifled debates of tha
upper house,
"There Is smne doubt," he begun,
"whet her Hlo government Is gnlbg'
about lis task In the rlttht way. The
war was never won by orders in coun
cil or proclamations, but by hard
hilling. If we want to brinjc Oer

the blockade power thoroughly and
'completely under the principles of n
I teruallonul law.
Strong; Policy N'mkUhI.
To do that It is necessary to havo
a policy and to turn It over to th
navy and let Ihe navy enforce It.
"These ordciii ln eoiiliL'll may bo

ami they are mt likely to win the
war. 1 would allow nothing what
ever to go into (leriiuiny, not even
luxuries. I would abolish tlu' dls
linctinn between iibMolllte and cojidl

tlie doelrine of continuous voyage to
all contra band. The Avar should bo
run by five cabinet ministers without
departmental duties. The longer Wo
have civilian control of the operations
of Hie War the more disasters we
shall suffer.'
The Marquis of I.aiiHilowne replied
lo Lord Boresiord, point by point.
"The conduct of the wuf," Ii mild.
' Is already in the bunds of n small
committee and thai ( qiiinll,lee so far
as the conduct of the war Is con
