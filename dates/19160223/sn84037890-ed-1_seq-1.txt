HE- MAKES PUBLIC STATEMENT
Frankfort, Ky., Feb. 10. Darks
dale Hamlett, former State Superin
tendent, anil Secretary of State
James P. Lewis to-night entered
into an agreement by which Ham
lett's suit in the Franklin Circuit
Court, contesting tho election of
Lewis, Is to bo-dismissed on Hnra
lett's motion. "Secretary of Stato
Lewis Is to pay all costs and th0 at
torney's fees. The agreement was
signed by the two principals and
James Andrew Scott, Elwood Ham
ilton and L. W. Morris, attorneys for
Hamlett, and Thomas B. McGregor,
attorney for Lewis.
The settlement of thb suit seems
to have been suddenly suggested and
consummated. One of the Impelling
factors apparently was a dawning
realization of tho cost, as the plead
ings on both sides furnished a basis
for opening ballot boxes in hundreds
of precincts in fully a third of the
counties in Kentucky.
Attorneys have been engaged in
taking depositions for several weeks
and have not been developing the
frauds and errors they alleged in
their petition and answer.
Incidental to the proceedings, in
one of the precincts in Elliott coun
ty, which Hamlett's petition sought
to throw out fdr fraud, two. of the
Republican officers were indicted,
but after a hearing they were dis
missed. Professor Hamlett said to-night
he is lit and will go to some springs
to recuperate, after which ho intends
to practice law.
i He gave out a brief statement,
paying:
"On account of unfortunate do
mestic affairs and lack of finances,
caused by the hard fight I had to
nako In the primary and my expen
ses during tho election, and since, I
llnd it impossible to continue tho
contest without imposing on my
friends. I bellovo I was fairly and
lionestly elected; but under tho cir
cumstances, with hostile conditions
both Insldo and outside the party, I
Seem it advisable to gjvo up tho con
test through a sense of loyalty to my
family first, and to the Democratic
party for the Bake of harmony."

THE SLAUGHTER OF 159.
In theLast Few Years Is Reveal,
ed By Report Condi
tions Improving.-
Washington, Feb. 19. The Sen
ate has received from Secretary of
Stato Lansing a bulky report on the.
relations between this Government
and Mexico, as requested In n'resolu
tlon recently Introduced by Senator
Fall, of New Mexico, Republican,
but tho thousands of words of text
added little to what has been made
known to tho public through news
paper accounts.
Tho confidential and vital Infor
matlon sought by the Senate was re
fused on tho ground that its publi
cation Is "incompatible with tho
public Interest."
The data disclosed that 7G Ameri
cans wero killed in Mexico In the
years 1913, 1914 and 1915, as com
pared with 17 In three years preced
ing, and that 20 civilian Americans
and 1C soldiers were killed on Amer
ican soil in the last three years as a
result of Mexican troubles.
Secretary Lansing's narration of
tho seven-power Pan-American con-
rorence, wnicu inviieu tno warring
factions In Mexico to a peace con
vention, Indicates that Vlctorlana
Carranza won tho support of tho
conforenco by refusing to comply
with its request. The Villa Generals
individually Indicated their compll
ance with tho request for a peaco
conference; the Carranza leaders de
clined Individually to make replies,
referring tho whole subject to Car
ranza. According to Mr. Lansing, tho In
dependence or obduracy of the Car
ranzlstas convinced the members of
tho Pan-American conference that
Carranza was the only man with any
'semblance of control over a large
number of leaders and territory.
v As to tho ability of Carranza to
fulfill his promises to protect foreign
lives and property, Lansing said that
under all the circumstances the do
facto Government, which at tho time
of recognition controlled more than
75 per cent 'of Mexican territory,
was affording "reasonably adequate
protection to the lives and property
of American citizens."

In
RECENT DECISION OF COURT
Of Appeals Majority Enough To
Decide the Question In
This .Matter.
ROAD CONSTRUCTION ROOMING
Frankfort, Ky Feb. 21. By dic
tum In tho opinion of Judge Hurt,
upholding tho validity of tho Fay
ette county road bond Issue of $300,
000, road bond Issues In thirteen,
counties, Involving Issues amount
ing to $2, S 10,000, which carried by
a majority but not a two-third3 vote,
probably will be validated.
Referring to Section l.'Ta of tho
Consttitutlon, permitting counties to
oto road bond issues not In excea3
of 5 per cent of the total property
assessment, anil Section 4307, Ken
tucky Statutes, Judge Hurt said:
"Neither tho Constitutional provis
ion nor tho statute adopted to carry
Into effect Its provisions, requires
'more than a majority of those vot
ing at tho election to give their as
sent In order to authorize the In-,
debtedness to be Incurred. '
Section 157 of the Constitution,
amended in 1909, required two
thirds of those voting to carry tho
proposition, but tho road bond
amendment Eays nothing about the
majority necessary. This question
was not raised in tho Fayette case,
as Ue bonds had more than two
thirds of the votes cast, but tho
contention was made that twb
thlrds of all tho voters of the county
did not vote for it. After passing
upon this point. Judge Hurt went
further and said a mere majority is
sufficient.
None of the counties in which
bond Issues carried but failed of a
two-thirds vote, have brought tho
question squarely before the court,
and in some of them officials, be
lieving tho election lost, have done
nothing for several months toward
issuing the bonds, while Pulaski has
voted $300,000 bond Issues three
times, but the C per cent limit, or
course, will provent the county issu
ing $900,000 in road bonds.
AH theso counties have held elec
tions within a year: Boyd voted
$300,000; Mason, Pulaski and Hop.
kins, $300,000; Daviess, $000,000;
Kenton, $250,000; Campbell, $200,
000; Oldham and Meade, $100,000;
Menifee, Trigg and Lincoln, $50,
000, and Bracken, $40,000.
Besides theso BaHard and Fayetto
have voted $300,000 by two-thirds
vote, Lewis and Breathitt, $150,000;
Greenup and Knox, $200,000; Bell,
Whitley, and .Harlan, $250,000;
Rockcastle, Scott and Laurel, $100,-
000; Nicholas, $125,000; Clinton,
$40,000, and Russell and Carroll,
$500,000.
Christian, Union, Powell, Hen

Owensboro, Ky., Feb. 19. Work
on 'tho construction of $000,000
worth of new roads in Daviess coun
ty will begin in n few months, ac
cording to statements made by coun
ty officials after receiving notifica
tion of the decision by the Court ot

Is sufficient to authorize a county to
Incur Indebtedness.
Last June the $G00,000 bond Is

voted on here. It lacked a two
tliir'd's majority vote, but carried by
several hundred votes. The Fiscal
dourt has already authorized tho is

up on account of an injunction suit
still pending.
However, It la certain that tho re

of the Fiscal Court said that the

CONSTITUTIONALITY DOUBTED
(By Will S. Kaltcnbacher.)
Frankfort, Ky., Feb. 18. If a bill
that Passed the upper branch of tho
Legislature to-day becomes a law,
tho consumers of ardent spirits in
"dry" tenltory will have to accom
modate their thirst to two quarts of
whiskey or brandy and five gallons
of beer a month tho limit of allow
ance pioposed In the Taylor bill, S.
II. 74.
The Senate parsed the bill by a
voto of 2.", to S, after it had been
amended to cut out any reference
to advertising which might bo con
strued as prohibiting the circulation
In "drj " territory of newspapers car
rying liquor advertisements.
The dissenting Senatois were: T.
A. Combs, of Fayette; lllte Huffak
er. C. H. Knight and S. L. Robert
son, of LouisWlle; T. J. Moore, of
Brcckenridge; L. N. Rayhurn, of
Lewis; A. E. Stricklett, of Coving
ton, ami J. M. Thompson, of Union.
An amendment proposing t't lim
it the shipments to a Case of a dozea
quarts of .vliiskcy and ten dozen'
pints of beer, offered by Senator
I Combs, was Ueil down.
The fight foi tho passngo of the
Taylor bill was led by Senator W. A..
Frost, of Graves, the recognized pro
hibition leaJ"', who uiged Its enact
ment as tho only means ot restrict
ing "bootlegging."
Senator T. J. Moore, or Brccken
ridge, In opposing the bill, went af
ter the, "dry" clement for what ho
called Its intemperate and Intolerant
attitude. Ho scored the prohibition
ists for emasculating in committee
his bill prohibiting the sale of
"coca-cola" in any place except
where liquors were legally sold.
Senator J. B, Zimmerman, of Bul
lit, urged tho passage of tho bill on
! tllfl nnniln,! tltni If ...nol.l ....! t am
I force the local option laws In "dry'
-"- h "uuu umi it duuiu leiui lu uil-
territory, which ho Insisted was tho
only barrier between State-wide pro
hibition. He was Interrupted by
replied ho had not. and that ho had
never drank intoxicants.
A big laugh was caused when
Senator Moore retorted:
"Well, I have, and every tlmo I
had to hunt tho 'bootlegger' Instead
of him looking mo up to sell me."
Urging that final action bo post
poned on the measure, tho constitu
tionality of which he declared was
very doubtful, to say the least, Sen
ator Hlto Huffnker deplorMl tho tac
tics of the "drys" in Impugning the
motives of all who did not agreo
with them. Ho ridiculed the pre
sumption of Senators not lawyers,
who so glibly assured that the pro
visions of the bill wero constitution
al. Senator Huffakor resented the Im
putation that those who favored
postponement wero dominated by
tho liquor Interests, as ho claimed
had been charged on tho floor. Ho
maintained that every court that
had passed on tho Webb-Kenyon Na
tional Liquor Shipment Bill had de
clared It unconstitutional and the
prevailing legal opinion was that It
would not ljold water. In that ovont,
ho declared, the Taylor bill would
go with It, If enacted. Ho declared
himself strongly In favor of the prin
ciple or local option and the strict
enforcement of the law.
Senator R. M. Salmon, of Hop
kins, took the position that the Tay
lor bill was fair enough even to
tho)o who wanted Intoxicating 11"
quors in "dry" territory, as tho
quantity permitted to be shipped
monthly was "enough to kill them
if 'they kept it up long enough."
