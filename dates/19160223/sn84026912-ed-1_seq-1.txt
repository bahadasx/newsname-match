? Distinctive Reason
What is the chief reason for the superi
ority of Royal Baking Powder?
There are several good reasons, but there
is one which distinguishes Royal from other
baking powders.
This reason, which every woman should
know, is that Royal Baking Powder is made
from cream of tartar, which comes from
grapes. This means a healthful fruit origin.
It means natural food as distinguished from
mineral substitutes used in other baking
powders.
There is no alum nor phosphate in Royal
Baking Powder.

Highly Esteemed lAi?y of Fair Play

Fair Play, Feb. 22.-Special: At
t'ho home of her son-in-law, Floyd 6.
Watson, on last Sunday afternoon,
February 20th, just 20 minutes be
fore 2 o'clock, our Heavenly Father
suddenly 'took a loving mother and
grandmother, Mrs. Sarah Ellen Bar
ton, to Himself. It seemed as
though He just said, '"lt is enough,"
and took bor where there is no sor
row and where t'he heaviest-laden
wayfarer may ajt last lay down his
weary load.
Mrs. Barton was one of the oldest
members of Hea vordem Baptist
church-a woman of strong Chris
tian character, possessing many qual
ities of mind and heart that made
her friendship worth while. Hers
was a life of positive influence. She
was known and admired for her en
ergy and industry, making tho homes
in Which she lived unusually attract
ive, and many who read these lines
will remember tho bountiful hospi
tality there dispensed.
This unexpected death is doubly,
sad because of the fact that ?ne had
been devotedly caring for her little
motherless grandchildren, whose
mother, Mrs. Floyd B. Watson, was
taken from Hiern several years ago.
Mrs. Barton waa a daughter of the
late Levi Burriss, of Anderson coun
ty, and was boni there September 13,
1838. She united with Mountain
Creek Baptist church at the early age
of ll years, anti had ever since been
a faithful member of the church. On
November 22, 1855, she was married
to James Robt. Glenn, and to this un
ion one child was born-William
Simpson Glenn. Her husband was
killed in the battle of Gaines's Mill.
She afterwards married Rev. H. M.
Barton, a faithful pastor for many
years in this county. Three children
survive her-William Simpson Glenn,
of Ellisville, Miss.; Mrs. William D.
Dobbs, of Monroe, Ga., and Prof.
Morris C. Barton, of Piedmont, S. C.
Five brothers and four sisters also
survive her-J. L., W. M. and N. C.
Burriss, of Anderson county; C. G.
Burriss, of Piedmont, and Rev. R. H.
Burriss, of Newberry; Mesdames
Doyt Richardson and W. E. Meredith,
of Hartwell, Ga.; Mrs. R. F. Stone,
Donalds; Mrs. A. F. McCreary, An

TH KV SHOT INTO TRAIN NO. 40,
Two Negroes Arrested nt Westinin
?ter on Minor und Serious Charge.
Sloan Hawkins niul Son Oglesby,
colored, were arrested In Westmin
ster lust Sunday evening and on Mon
day morning Hawkins was tried be
fore the mayor of Westminster on
the charges of carrying concealed
wean o ns, drunk and disorderly and
resisting arrest. He was given a *.o
tal sentence for all cases in which
there was. runvietion amounting to
$45 or 70 days on the imbllo works.
Hawkins is now a valient (though
not particularly enthusiastic) road
building laborer, he having been sent
up to the county chain gang for 30
days in default of $25 which was as
sessed' asalm.t him by Magistrate S.
H. Marett, of Westminster, who had
Hawkins before htm on tho charge of
carrying concealed weapon?.
Son Oglesby was more fortunate
than Hawkins. He was charged with
the shooting into Southern passenger
train No. 4 0 near Harbin's Sunday
afternoon. Five shots were fired, and
it is said that at least three of the
live bullets fired entered parts of the
train. Passengers on tho train,
wihioh is a local, recognized the two
negroes and left complaint at West-1
minster when the train reached that
town and the officers were on tho
lookout for them when they came
Into town later in the evening. Og
lesby, lt ls said, did the shooting,
but Hawkins had the pistol. Ogles
by asked Hawkins for the pistol and
told Mm to "watch me sfhoot Into
uhat train," which he proceeded to
do. On the hearing1 before Magis
trate Marett Oglesby was released
until tho March term of Criminal
Court on a bont? of $700. Just what
degree of guilt attaches to Hewkin?
on this charge will be threshed out
In Court. He will be brought In
from the gang to attend Court and
doubtless will face a charge of be
ing accessory before the fact In the
case against Oglesby for shooting
Into the train, ho having given over
the pistol, it 1s said, on request for
lt for the purpose of shooting into
tho moving train.
Hawkins was brought over Ito
Walhalla by Sheriff John W. Davis,
and was soon thereafter turned over
to Supervisor Foster, who gave him
work to do out in tho country. He
has considerable company out there,
and will be carefully guarded. The
penalty attached to firing Into a
train is quite severe, and both Haw
kins and Oglesby have rather bright
prospects of drawing tickets good
for extensive work for the benefit of
the county and not a few meals at
the county's expen?e.
