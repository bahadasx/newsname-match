NWITH PARLEYING
OVER SUBMARINESON 15 MILE FRONT
Offioials Believe Showdown
With Germany May Come in
Day or Two.
DEPENDS ON GERMAN ENVOY
Further Attempts at Evasion
Expeoted to Bring Sharp
Note to Berlin.
A showdown between the United
States and Germany on the question of
submarine warfare may develop within
the next day or two.
Everything depends on the kind of In
structions which Count von Bernstorff
receives from Berlin. x
If, as Is expected, he will be told by
his government to seek to temporise
with the United States and endeavor to
obtain acquiescence In Germany's new
policy of sea terrorism, there is strong
likelihood that tho next communication
from the United States to Berlin will bo
the sharpest and most abrupt ever sent
Through With Parleying.
President Wilson is described by of
ficials as being done with parleying.
For nine months, his friends point out,
tho President has displayed remarkable
patience while the German government
has tried by every means possible to
avoid giving the satisfaction demanded
for the slaughter of the 116 American
men, women, and children who went
down with the Lusltanla.
Already, owing t." the vigorous stand
which tho President has taken, thero
has been a sudden collapse of the agita
tion among Democrats tn Congress In
favor of legislation prohibiting Ameri
cans from traveling on armed merchant
vessels.
Uppermost among the demands made
by the United States was the stipula
tion that Germany should give absolute
assurances that In tho future hr sub
marines would live up to the rule of
International law requiring warships to
warn, visit ind search enemy, merchant
craft thoy attack, and to care for the
safety of noncombatants on board if
circumstances require them to sink
such merchant craft.
Attempt At Evasion.
The President and his advisers, it Is
declared, regard the new German sub
marine declaration na mmnl.t.lv htitlu
fylng the assurance which. Gaumy -
naa Hgroea to give.
Attempt on tha part of Germany to
Insist on her tigt to sink armed enemy
merchantmen without warning, the Ad
ministration regards aa a deliberate at
tempt to evade tho law.
Contrary to reports which have
emanated from German sources that
ino American disarmament proposals to
the allies gave Germany reason to be
lieve that the new declaration would
partment declare that Count von Bern
storff knew perfectly well that such
was not the case.
"Don't Rock the Boat,"
Wilson Advises Congress
President Wilson has told Senator
Stone, Senator Kern, Chairman Flood
and other Democratic leaders in effect
that this Is no time to "rock the boat"
in Congress.
He has advised strongly that It will be
much better for Congress to leave the
international situation to the executive
end of the Government
Furthermore, he has given the leaders
to understand that it would be greatly
to his advantage to have speech-making
relative to the foreign situation choked
off as far as possible.
Even replies to the Root speech. It Is
declared In responsible quarters, are re
garded as of doubtful value and of du
bious expediency,
Senator Stone, chairman of the For
eign Relations Committee, who said yes
terday that he would make his speech
In reply to Root as contemplated, has
determined, It Is learned, to defer mak
ing his speech to a more propitious time.
Senator Stone's decision Is taken as
highly significant.
Tho word went along the lino today
that the President felt this was no time
for Congress to be adding verbal fuel
to the flames of the International dis
pute. Coupled with the disclosure that the
President Is opposed to having a reso
lution adopted warning Americans to
keep off armed ships, this has tended
to enhance the feeling that the German
controversy Is becoming critical.
Under the surface tn Congress, both
In Senate and House, there Is a fer
ment of discussion over the submarine
developments.
Many members are known to be ap
prehensive. Shields Power Bill
Attacked in Senate
Norr.'s Asserts Measure Gives Mil
lions Away Forever With
out Compensation.
The Shields water power bill grants
forever rights worth millions of dol
lars without one cent of compensation
to the Government, Senator Norrls of
Nebraska charged In an attack on the
bill In the Benate this afternoon.
"Apparently this bill leases power
sites for a fifty-year period," he said,
"but reslly the cause by which the Gov
ernment hopes to regain the sites Is not
of the slightest value. Bo many con
ditions and restrictions are placed on
tne recapture of tho sites that people
and officials would tire of tho effort.
"It Is specifically provided, too, that
the Government must pay for a great
number of Intangible values, including
f;ooo win ana prospective profits wnen
t seeks to take back thiaa sites. These
values are created solely by the people
and by the franchlso granted by the
Government.
"Monopoly Is incurred by permitting a
man to take a alto capable of develop

100 horsepower, and hold the alto against
