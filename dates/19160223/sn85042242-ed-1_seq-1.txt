Recent Action of Board of Re*
gents Characterized as
"Spanish Diplomacy."
Fargo, Feb. 22.—President John H.
Worst of the North Dakota Agricul­
tural college today made the open
charge that he was being ousted from
the position of act've head of the col­
lege as the result of a plan that was
evolved in Minneapolis in 1911. by
several "big business" men who or­
ganized the Better Farming associa­
tion.
Yesterday President Worst was not­
ified that the board of regents had
"decided to elect" him president
emeritus, of the college.
"1 was informed that 1 had been
ejected" said President Worst today.
Mr. Crawford and Mr. White, at a con­
ference with me yesterday afternoon,
informed me that the board bad "de­
cided to elect" me to that position.
"They say they are offering me the
honor of Being president emeritus. I
maintain -that this is not an honor.
Rather it is Spanish diplomacy. It is
simply an attempt to oust me from
active head of the institution, under
the guise^'br^tittlelrifTnlvarf Mhor ity

by
.spreading sen-
sati9a*lr reports, through the newspa­
pers -regarding 'diseased conditions-of
North soil. This man said that as a
result of Professor Bolley's articles,
eastern money lenders were becom­
ing alarmed and that Bolley's articles
were hurting the mortgage business
and the state.
Bolley's Letters.
"Professor Bolley was not here at
the time, so I wrote him the follow
ins letter*
July 20, 1911. Professor H. L. Bol­
ley, Audubon, Minn. Dear Sir:
There is considerable complaint
ffotn rather influential sources against
some of your utterances, relative to
the diseased condition of the soil of
the state. The impression gets out
that the trouble is a permanent one
ahd I am informed that a number of
persons are seriously handicapped for
the reason that men of means will not
loan or invest money in the state for
fear that there is something perma­
nently wrong with the soil.
I do not think it was your inten­
tion to create any such impression
and as a matter of fact, we must
handle all matters that offset the fi­
nancial interests of the state some­
what delicately. This is especially
true on account of the sad condition
that many of our farmers are in at
the present time.
I think it would be well to remove
any such impressions, from the fact
that with proper farm management
these diseases need not and doubtless
will not seriously affect the prosper­
ity of the Btate.
I am going away tomorrow night
and am dropping you these lines to
put you on your guard. We must pay
some attention to sentiment, especial­
ly when it does not materially inter­
fere with our work.
J. H. Worst, president.
Invited to Meeting.
"Sometime during the year 1911, (I
do not remember the exact date,
which is immaterial') I was invited to
attend a conference in Minneapolis
for the purpose of considering the
feasibility of effecting an organiza­
tion to enable the farmers of North
Dakota to enjoy greater prosperity.
"A meeting was held in the office
Of Mr. Rogers, the lumberman, and
there were present Mr. Howe, the ele
viator man, Mr. Weiser of the First
National bank of Fargo, Alex Stern,
I, et. al. Mr. Rogers acted as chair
Aan. He stated that the North Da­
kota farmers were in bad shape that
the twin city institutions looked upon
North Dakota as their customer, and
they were willing to go down into
their pockets for the necessary funds
to render assistance to the North Da­
kota farmers.
?I was asked to submit a plan. I
Outlined a plan somewhat similar to
the present county agency plan, which
corresponds very closely with the pro

Unearth Plot
To Destroy
Cathedral
Minneapolis, Minn., Feb. 22.—Min­
neapolis police tonight were search­
ing for a man suspected of trying to
damage the pro-cathedral of SI. Mary
here and who fired twice at the chief
engineer of the cathedral when the
latter and an assistant discovered him
prowling about the basement of the
edifice late last night. Neither bul­
let took effect.
The shooting incident was reported
to the police today, together with in­
formation of recent small robberies
in this building and the parochial
school, which are connected by a tun­
nel, and of alleged tampering with the
machinery of the heating system.
Peter Callahan, cliief engineer, said
that someone had 'drawn the water
from one of the big boilers last night,
but it was discovered in time to avert
a boiler explosion.
The authorities believe the man be?
ing sought has lived several months
in an obscure portion of the pro- Ca­
thedral basement.

DYNAMITE GORGES IN
THE HEART RIVER
Mandan, N. D., Feb. 22.—Although
the city was threatened yesterday,
Sunday and today by extremely high
water, the untiring efforts of the rail­
road officials, who have joined hand3
with the city officers, have resulted ill
the prevention of what might have
proved serious floods.
The N. 'P. officers, Assistant Train­
master John Wynn of the Yellow­
stone division, Tloadmaster Nelson of
the Yellowstone division, and Train­
master J. B. Glasgow and Roadmas
ter F. G. Cook of the branch lines
have practically taken charge of the
work of loosening the gorges. The
•Northern Pacific has purchased a
large supply of dynamite and, work­
ing a big force of men this morning
cleared the gorge below Dogtown.
Just before noon they took up the
work of blowing up. the gorges be­
tween the mill and the round house
property. As a fesult the Heart is
rapidly clearing. It was expected
that an effort might be made late
this afternoon to dislodge the ice
which has jammed near the main
line railroad bridges at the west end
of the city.
Was Over Tracks.
The gorges which formed last night
above the reform school forced the
water up the extreme west end of
Main street along the railroad tracks
past the (Michael Rafferty brickyard
and the David Carey home. In about
an hour the water rose over a foot
above the previous high mark and
was runing over the main line rail­
road tracks. A good sized stream
was pouring under near the viaduct
at the north side of the tracks. How­
ever, this was stopped.
For Conference.
Supt. T. H. Lantry of the Yellow­
stone division arrived this afternoon
from Glendive for a conference with
the local officials, who are working
to prevent any further high water.
It is the concensus of opinion thht
unless the .Missouri begins to break
up there need be little fear of the
Heart river causing any further dam­
age.

Milford, Conn., Feb. 22.—Disregard
of a cautioning trignal was probably
responsible for the rear end collision
on the New York, New Haven and
Hartford railroad near here today, in
which eight persons lost their lives
and upwards of 50 persons were in­
jured, according to Charles Elwell of
the Connecticut Utility commission.
The state investigation!'Already is
well underway, but in much as
four of ffie railroad employees the
most important witnesses, were kill­
ed, it will be difficult to fix respon­
sibility, Mr. Elwell said.
Two passengers, a man and a wo­
man, were killed instantly when a
local running 40 miles an hour crash­
ed into the rear end of the Greenfield
Express, which had been stalled be­
cause of a broken air hose. Two
other passengers died in hospitals to
which they were taken.
The official theory of the accident
here is that the engineer disregarded
or failed to see the cautioning signal
and could not make his brakes hold
when he came in sight of the signal
One of the heroes of the accident was
George Tourtellette, flagman who was
sent back from the stalled train and
who stood in the path of the ap
proaching train and frantically waved
the red flag. He stayed at his post,
and when it was impossible to escape,
was run over and kiued.
Many of the passengers were Yale
graduates who were returning to New
York after attending an alumni m§^t
ihgat-We'# Haven.
A freight train passing on another
track complicated the wreck. The
freight crashed into the wreckage.
Passengers were buried beneath
splintered wood and twisted steel.
The boiler of the locomotive explod
td.
The bodies of the engineman and
fireman were found beneath the
wreckage.
IEET III FARGO

in it, the officers of the association
have extended an invitation to mem­
bers of the Town Criers' club, the
merchants and all others interested
in the subject, to be present and hear
Dr. Krebs.
!H. .T. Alsop, secretary of the asso­

The county officials accompanied the
prisoner to IMott, where he pleaded
guilty to the charge of gambling and
was sentenced by Judge Crawford.
In passing sentence on the confess­

ed him with a fine of ISO and costs,
amounting in all to about $150.

Make Thorough Investigation
of Graft Allegation.
Chicago, Feb. 22.—Charging that
'Mrs. Walter Page Eaton had paid
over part of her semi-monthly salary
as superintendent of the bureau of
social surveys to her official superior,
Mrs. Louise Osborne Rowe, head of
the city public welfare bureau, stir­
red political circles today.
The allegation that the money thus
paid was to go to the relief of Mrs.
(Margaret E. Mivelas, widowed sister
of the wile of (Mayor Thompson cen­
tered the attention of the mayor's
official and private family. In addi­
tion, Mrs. Eaton asserted that she
bad been subject, to the dictation of
Fred Lundin, former congressman
and political adviser of Mayor Thomp­
son, and that lier refusal to seek cer­
tain aldermen not in favor of the city
administration she had been told by
Mrs. Rowe displeased Mr. Lundin.
iMrs. Eaton has long been a prom­
inent member of various women's or­
ganizations and Mrs. Rowe, though
less active, holds one of the most im­
portant positions of any woman in the
state.
Investigation of the charges will be­

ilVE MEN, INTEBESTjiD.,
IN NEW PROPOSITION
The question of quarters is all that
stands in the way of opening a real
business college in the capital city,
according to a statement made last
night by G. M. Langum, head of the
Bismarck Business College company,
tentative plans for the incorporation
of which are now being made.
Five men are back of the plan to
incorporate and enlarge the 'business
college, making it second to none in
the Northwest, but unless they can
find suitable quarters in the capital
city, they will be forced to locate
elsewhere or drop their plans. The
quarters must be large enough to pro­
vide school room and also dormitory
quarters for the students.
Five men are back of the scheme:
G. M. Langum, Prof. C. L. Vigness,
county superintendent Prof. R. H.
Boyd and Prof. James F. Pearcy.
The fifth man in the organization
does not wish his name made public.
The company will be capitalized for
$20,01M), of which amount $15,000 has
already been subscribed. They will
take over the present Bismarck Busi­
ness college, operated by Mr. Lang­
um, and will enlarge the scope of its
work.
Normal Department.
A music and normal department
will be added to the curriculum of
the school, in addition to courses in
shorthand, commercial courses of all
kinds, elementary English and teleg­
raphy.
The organizers state that within a
year, if quarters can be secured here,
they will have between 400 and SO0
students enrolled. Mr. Langum at
present has 95 enrolled in the Fis
marck (Business college, and he open­
ed the school late in the season, and
has been handicapped by lack of room
since he started. His quarters are
more than overcrowded at the pres­
ent time.
