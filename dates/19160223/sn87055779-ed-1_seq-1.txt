International News Service:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 3. Demo
cratic leaders sought this afternoon
to arrange a secret conference to bo
held tonight to discuss the adminis
tration's stand on the submarine
question.
Sen. Stone, chairman of the sen
ate foreign relations committee,
after several telephone conferences
with Chairman Flood of the house
foreign affairs committee, agreed to
make an effort to get influential
democratic senators and representa
tives together.
Internathtinl Ne?s Service:
WA.SH INGTON. Feb. 2 3. Ger
many will ask the United States to
define defensive armament on mer
chant vessels. Meanwhile this gov
ernment will again be assured that
all promises that liners will be warn
ed, previously made, will be lived
up to. Ry this action the German
foreign ottlce, 1 is understood here,
hopes to prevent any sum man' ac
tion on the part of the United States
pending tho development of the new
German campaign against armed
merchantmen.
Just how far this will prove ef
fective 1a not yet known. Pres't
Wilson ha very frankly told the
congressional leaders that he intends
getting complete assurances from
the Teutonic powers that will abso
lutely safeguard American interests.
The (rerman ambassador ha been in
formed that this government stands
squarely on its original declaration
made- at the time the submarine
blockade originally wa declared by
Germany, that American citizens
have the right to travel at will on
the high seas.
And to this has been added the
statement that the proposed attacks
on armed merchantmen Is illegal.
Having assumed this position, there
fore, officials say they don't believe
that the president will permit any
long drawn out negotiations with
Germany at this time.
Meanwhile officials predict that
the complete record of the German
foreign office dealing with the al
leged secret orders to all Hritish
merchant skippers to attack ami sink
ubmarines and to resist at all times
will reach Scc'y Irnsing tomorrow or
Friday. After it has been read by
t lie secretary he is expected to con
fer with Fount von Bernstorff on the
subect.
A reply also is looked for before
the end of this week from Great
r.ritaln on the protest against inter
ference with American mails. An in
timation from Ami asad'r Page lias
leached the state department that
L'ngland wiil defend the mail
nelzures on the ground that British
law and not international regulations
apply in this case. The United
States will refuse to accept this doc
trine and it is expected that another
and much sharper protect will fol
low. REAK SURE T

ORTMADETO
PREVENT MEETIN
Friends of Board Members
Object to Use of Chamber
of Commerce Room.
Pspite opposition to a meeting of
Its kind being held at the Chamber
of Commerce, prominent citizens
and a number of school people will
get together at that place at 8:30
o'clock tonight to take some action
In regard to the outslng of Supt. I
J. Montgomery by E. 15. Rupel and
William Clem, the majority members
of the board of education. For a
time the opposition was so strong:
that the red room of the Oliver ho
tel was being considered as the
place of the meeting.
Ever since the meeting was an
nounced on Monday, the anti-Montgomery
people have been criticizing
the Chamber of Commerce for mix
ing In the affair. One who Is sup
posed to be very close to Mayor
Keller and his two appointees on
the school board it thought to have
made the first objection.
This man, who is Ixdleved to know
the inner workings of the present
city administration well enough to
be used as a mouthpiece, has been
approaching men who were In fa
vor of Mr. Montgomery to get them
to hold the meeting at some other
place. It is thought by those who
have taken up Mr. Montgomery's
side of the affair that his. Mayor
Keller's and the appointees pur
pose was to have the meeting called
off entirely.
He advanced the proposition that
an affair of this kind was something
in which that organization should
take part. It was explained to him
that the Chamber of Commerce was
not holding the meeting, but that it
was merely being held at the build
ing a numerous other sessions are.
Following tonight's meeting, ac
tion of some kind is expected
Thursday or Friday from the school
principals and teachers who favor
Mr. Montgomery. Karly last week
when the board refused to renew
his contract for another year the
teachers considered holding an In
dignation meeting, but it was de
cided tr. wait until the citizens did
something.
Nothing definite has been outlined
for tonight's metting. Citizens who
have been interested in the matter
will give their views anil it is ex
pected that some of them will ad
vance plans of action. The best of
these probably will be adopted ns
the method of attempting to secure
Mr. Montgomery's reappointment.

Crones' Plot Failed Because
Steward Prepared New
Filling For Soup,
International News Scrviro:
CHICAGO. Feb. 23. That one
slip in the plans of Jean Crones, an
archist, presented the death of every'
guest at the Archbishop Mundelein
banquet was the statement today of
Herman Schuettler, first deputy su
perintendent of police who has be-en
working on the roicon plot while the
police of every city in the country
has teen searching for Crones.
When Jean Crones walked out of
the University club for the last time
he was confident, the first deputy
declared, that every one of the 296
prominent men attending the ban
quet would he dead within a short
time after eating the banquet soup,
that they would be served with five
times the amount of arsenic that
chemical analysis have shown each
portion of the soup contained.
According to the tracing of Crones'
movements, the poisoner prepared
five time as much poisoned soup
stock as was used. A superior of
Crones, inspecting the kitchen Just
prior to the banquet, noted that
some of the soup stock was changed
in appearance, and thinking some of
it had spoiled, ordered four-fifths
of it thrown away.
"Not one of the poisoned guests
know how near all of them were to
death," said Deputy Supt. Schuettler,
"and they never would have known,
had not the steward who feared
that he would be blamed for allow
ing the soup stock to spoil, con
fessed that he sneaked 36 chiekens
out of the ice box and made new
stock for the soup, using only one
fifth of that which Cremen had pre
pared." WAR AND MORE WAR,

The war ottice communique Mates

News-Tlme Special Service:
PARIS, Fei. 23. The triple of
fensive being carried out by the
Germans in West I "anders, in Ar
tois and to the north of Verdun is
believed by French military experts
to be the lat Kreat effort to ! reak
the allies' lines in the v est.
If the Germans are unsuccessful
in their attempts to cut through to
the channel coa.st in West Flanders
und to roll back the Irench at Ver
dun, the kaiser will probably bi
forced to assume the defensive 011
every front until the end of th- war.
Assaults were launched by thft
Germans with picked troops after a
furious bombardment cf the Anglo
French positions around Ypr-s,
north of Arras and north of Ver
dun. At numerous points the Teu
tons were n-ble to penetrate the ad
vanced lines of the allies over a vlde
frr.nt and at some places the sup
porting trenches were taken, but the
war ofüce claims that in nearly every'
instance the attacking forces wer
hurled from the second line trenches
by means of counter-attacks.
Isxcs Are GriMt.
In Artois the attack was carried
out by an entire division of !0.X)0
men. Fnormo-us losses were suffer
ed a-s the French and British,
brought into play all their artillry
and rained a hurricane of shell
upon the attacking troops.
At many places the artillery fir
of the Germans had destroyed th
trenches which they afterward at
tacked nd captured with infantry.
The battered redoubts offered no
protection to their captors. tinS
smashed to ruins by the hi shell.
North .f Verdun along the Meusi
river, the German army f the
crown prince concentrated its at
tack against the French ixisitlonH
south and east ef Brabant. At that
point the Germans hav; been dl
reeting a terrinc fire from their big
guns upon Forts De Belleville, I
Douaumount, De, Souville, Chiosol,
