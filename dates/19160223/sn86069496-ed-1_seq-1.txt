The Spirit of Good Roads.
As we build good roads, farm lands
and farm products will go up in price,
farm products because of the cheap
ness of marketing, and because they
can be pub there while prices are good
In the South two bales of cottoh
make a good load for a good team in
mud roads. 12 bales can be hauled by
the same team oua good road. Every
body work and talk for better roads
If all the road overseers in the county
will use early in the summer the road
grades, grade well the roads where
they work, leaving it smooth and keep
the water out of the road bed, the
disc roads will be greatly improved.
Russell county took one step forward
when they voted $40,000 bond Issue,
and it may have been costly to get
machinery and get started under un
favorable weather conditions, but we
hope and believe the court will con
tract the balance of the road to some
one so that the people will know just
how much road they will get for the
money. Finding fault and chronic
kicking never has built up a commu
nity or county, but honest co-operation
and help is what makes it easy
to perform seemingly impossible
things. Other counties are getting
good pikes for 82,500 to $3,000, .per mile,
why not Russell county? Every body
with shoulders to the wheel, then
when "Ready bovs" come, go to it.

Gone to Her Reward.
Last Wednesday night, the 16th
insb., Mrs. Lucy Coffey, who was the
beloved wife of T. J. Coffey, died at
her late home in Adair .county, one
mile from Bridgeport. She was a
victim of pneumonia and was sick bub
a few days. The deceased was a de
voted member of the Methodist
Church and was about sevenby-five
years old. In her young womanhood
she was well acquainted about Colum
bia and often visited here, being a sis
ter of the late W. T. and T. R Price,
making Mr. W. Titus Price and Mr.
R. H. Price her nephews
She was a lady highly respected f or
her many Christian virtues, and wiH
be greatly "missed, nob only by her
aged husband and children, but by the
entire neighborhood in which she
lived.
Mr. J. P. Dohoney, Sr., who has
been afflicted for several years, in
company with his nephew, Dr. W. J.
Flowers, went to Louisville last Fri;
day. He will be examined by Dr.
"Wathen, and if that surgeon deems it
necessary an operation will be per
formed. His affliction is of a serious
nature, and Mr. Dohoney 's numerous
friends trust that if he goes under the
knife he will stand the ordeal heroic
ally,, and will be permitted to return
home in two or three weeks.
A large barn containing 10,000
pounds of tobacco, a lot of corn and
hay farming Implements, etc., which

Bussell Springs will likely put in an
electric light plant The proposition
is now being considered, and many of
the business men favor it. It would
be a great enterprise, and the conven

that it is wide awake, something is
going to be doing.

REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS OF
ADAIR.
(by h. c. baker)
William Hurt was 75 years old when
ho filed his declaration. When he en
listed he resided in Bedford county,
Virginia, and entered the service in
1778 with Capt. Alexander Cummins
in the 14th Regiment of the Virginia
line Cols. Davis and Bluford were
commanders of his regiment They
marched from headquarters at Valley
Forge to Monmouth, and he was in
that battle under Gen. Lee. Gen. Lee
retreated, and on his retreat was met
by General Washington, "and some
words of considerable warmth ensued,
after which General Washington ad
vanced, and made a seconcTattack on
the British."
He says he then marched about
sometime in New Jersey and Pennsyl
vania, and then marched to the White
Plains in the State of Now York and
encamped for some time from there
he marched to Bonbrook, New Jersey,
and took quarters for the winter. In
the spring of 1779 he was discharged
at that place. During a part of his'
service he was sergeant. The inci
dent of the meeting of Washington
and Lee referred to above is mention
ed by the historians of the United
States, but, it is not certain that any
account of it is more suggestive than
that of this old soldier when he says,
"And some words of considerable
warmth ensued." Ridpath, in his
history of tht United States, says of
it:
"Lee, who had opposed the battle,
and was not anxious for victory, or
dered his line to fall back to a strong
er position, bub the troops mistook his
order, and began a retreat, the British
charging after them. Washington
met the fugitives, rallied them, ad
ministered a severe rebuke to Lee, and
ordered him to the rear,"
We do not think we read it in any
history if not, it has come tq us as a
tradition, possibly through this sol
dier, or some of the others who were
present on the occasion, for several of
the old pioneers of Adair were in the
battle, that the father of our country
at the time in the righteoutness of
his wrath indulged in expletives very
suggestive of fire and brimstone, and
a place described in Milton.s Paradise
Lost.
Our soldier, however, puts it mildly
as "words of considerable warmth"
not cuss words. He could, "not say his
old' General would do a thing of that
J kind! W,e may add-here that William
Hurt was., verj, -intimately .connected
with-the early affairs ob the county, as
his descendants have been since.
One of hls'sons, Young E.Burt, was
sheriff.of the county, during the un
settled timesof nur civil war. Two
of the sons of Young E. Hurt, viz , R.
M. and J. W. Hurt, have held the
same position in the county. An
other of his sous,- L. B. Hurt, has
served a term as Master Commissioner
of the circuit court, and a term as
county clerk. His youngest son,
Judge Rollin Hurt, of the Kentucky
court of Appeals, also served two
terms as County Attorney.
James Irvine, another Revolution
ary soldier, has many descendants heie
and elsewhere, men of high standing
and influence. He gives his age as 76
years.
He entered the service from Halli
fax county, Virginia, in May, 1776, in
the 69th regiment Virginia line un
der Capt Rogers, the regiment com
manded bj Col. Haynes Morgan.
His first services were against Lord
Dunnmore, and in this service marched
to a place called Cherry Point at the
mouth of the Potomac. He then
marched against the Cherokees to
Long; Island of Holston, where, they
built a fort. . After returniDghome-he
remained for some time as a minute
man, ready to be called out at any time.
The next spring he was called out for
a tour against the Tories, and marched,
to a river in North Carolina, called
Tear river. They took several Tories
and broke up some of their little
stands where they were collected. Af-
ter his return from Tear river, he took
a tour in South Carolina under the
command of Col. Mason, marched bo a
place called Stonaw in South Carolina,
where he was engaged in a battla with
the British. Theregiaseob there was
commanded by Col. Williamson, of
South Carolina. He called a retreat
and the whole regiment retreated.
He was then discharged on-the banks
of the Santee River
The next spring he was called oub
with his wagon andjieam by the Quar
ter Master, and hauled from different
parts of Halhfax and Pittsylvania
counties, provisions to a place called
Peytonsburg. He also went from
these counties to Goochland and Am
herst counties and hauled provisions
of the army to Irvine's old-store just
below the mouth of Eockfish and
James river. The provisions were re
ceived there by Richard. Yarbour,
Quarter Master. He then went with
his wagon and team to Prince Edward
Court House, and took a load of pro
vision and clothing for the army.
He never received one cent for the
use of his wagon or team.
In September, 1781, he joined Gen
Lawson's brigade, and was marched to
York, and there remained in camp
until the siege commenced, and was
in the siege from beginning to end.
He then went to Maryland, and as
sisted to guard the prisoners taken in
that State. Hejiad his wagon and
team in the service during the whole
of this tour, covering about three
months.
He was placed by CoL Boyed in
charge of the magazine at Boyed's
landing in Hallifax county, at which
point he was eugaged aboub four
months.
This old soldier was bora in Hallifax
county, Virginia, in bhe year 1754.
When he came to Kentucky, he settled
on' Russell, s creek, Adair county,
where he was living wheti he made
his declaration.
John Hamilton aged 73 years, made
application under the acts of 1818 and
1820 He enlisted in 1777 in the coun
ty of Baltimore, Maryland, under
Capt. John Smith, in the Third Mary
land regiment
During said service he was in many
battles, to-wlt, ab the taking of Stony
Point, ab Gates Defeat, the battles of
Guilford, Eutaw, Camden, Cowpens
and several other battles and skir
mishes against the common enemy.
He was appointed orderly sergeant
and held this position until he was
honorably discharged ab Annapolis,
Maryland. . lap-
John Ross aged 71, applied'for pen
sion under bhe same acts. He served
tours in the militia against the Cher
okee Indians and British. He then in
1776 enlisted from the county of Bed
ford, Virginia, in the company com
manded by Capt George Lambert, in
the 14th Virginia regiment command
ed by Col. Charles Lewis, Gen. Wead
en's Brigade, and continued in the
service for the full term. He was in
the battles of Germantown, Stony
Point, Brandywine, and many other
smaller engagements-
