to Vice Admiral Sir David Beatty,
made public last night.
•'I have been greatly interested in
the detail* of the pslendid work done
by the officers and men of the battle
cruiser fleet in making munitions,"
the minister writes. "The output
which already has been reached is
very striking, but more important
even than the material results Is the
magnificent spirit which prompted, the
men of the fleet to. devote their leisure
to give the men in. the trenches such
loyal and effective support..
"The fact also that the work is be

Lieutenant Berg Has Extra
Territorial Rights That
Protect Him.
Washington, Feb. 23.—Formal rep
resentations were made to the state
department by the German embassy
against proceedings brought in the
federal courts at Norfolk to return the
captured British liner Appam, to her
owners.
In a note presented by Count von
Bernstorff, it is contended that many
precedents, as well as the terms of
the Prussian-American treaty, provide
that no legal action can lie against
the Appam, held by a German crew
as a war prise, nor against Lieuten
ant Berg, her commander. It is also
contended that Inasmuch as Berg has
extra territorial rights, ho legal action
can lie against him.
The note suggests that when the
case comes up in court March 2, that
the state department will inform the
court of the terms of the treaty.

Fargo, N. D., Feb. 23.—The achieve
ments of democracy were vividly por
trayed in a series of eloquent address
es before an audience of fully 400 men
and women who had gathered from
all parts of the state to attend the
democratic "achievement banquet" S,t
the auditorium in this city.
If there were any republicans pres
ent among the large gathering their
ears must have fairly tingled as they
listened to the many shameful mis
deeds that were saddled upon their or.
ganlsation by the ardent champions
of the democratic cause.
Attorney Lovell Presides.
Attorney V. R. Lovell of this city,
presided and before calling on the
speakers, read a number of telegrams
and letters from prominent democrats
who were unable to be present. Among
these were messages from President
Wilson, John Burke, W. G. McAdoo,
Thos. R. Marshall, Osoar W. Under
wood, Postmaster General Burleson
and Wm. C. Bloodfield. All expressed
their deep regrets at not being able to
attend and wishing the democrats of
this state much suoceos.
Mr. Lovell stated that the democrats
of North Dakota need offer no apolo
gy for holding a banquet to celebrate
their achievements on Washington's
birthday. He touched briefly on the
splendid work of President Wilson
during the present crisis and stated
that the democratic party was solidly
behind him. With a few Introductory
remarks he then presented Senator W.
E. Purcell of Wahpeton, as the first
speaker of the evening.
Senator PuroeU.
Former Senator Purcell compli
mented the ladies for .being present at
the banquet and stated that he was
glad that they too were taking an ac
tive interest in politics.
"It la fitting that the democrats of
North Dakota should get together,"
continued the senator, "and talk
things over in this manner, for at no
time in the history of the country has
the party taken so great a part in
politics as In the present administra
tion. The platform that President Wil
son was elected on has been carried
out to the letter.
'Tlrst the tariff was reduced and
we can well remember the bitter op
position that was met. But it stands
today on the statute books—a law that
was desired by the people. The reason
that this law has failed Is not through
any fault of the democratic party but
because the Imports have failed to
come into the country."
The speaker told of the income tax
and said that the republicans claimed
to have fathered this bill. He strongly
denied this claim and defied anyone to
aay that any republican organisation
supported such a measure.
Defends Mexican Policy.
"We have heard much criticism of
Mr. Wilson's Mexican' policy," contin
ued Senator Purcell, "but the same
conditions existed in Mexico before
Wilson^ took office. Why did Mr. Taft
not remedy these conditions? If It was
wrong for Wilson not to intervene,
why was it not wrong for Taft?
*rI think that we have no rlght to
Interfere .In the affair .of other nations
and chat Mf. Wilson was right. He, did
Just what any other president would
do .wivo desired to fcsap hia country,

situation.

Theodore Roosevelt and his following
in no uncertain terms. In speaking of
the.navy she said: "We do not want
any more of the rotten old republican
boats—we want the all wool and a
yard wide boats that will be built by
the democratic administration."
In closing Mrs. Keough stated that
Wilson would be the next president of
the United Btatee and urged the dem

next election.
Man Who Nominated Bryan.
The last speaker of the evening was
I. J. Dunn, the man who nominated
Wm. J. Bryan at the Denver conven

his address that we were at the
threshhold of a presidential campaign
of great Importance—a campaign that
would decide whether or not the dem
ocratic party would guide the des
tinies of the nation for another four
years.
The speaker stated that he had not
always voted for every individual the
democratic party had nominated. He
felt that was every man's right to
reject any oandidate for office whom
be did not believe was lit to serve the
best interests of the people.
Mr.

Boast That Enough Votes
Will be Made to Carry
Movement.
Washington ,Feb. 23.—-The peren

old features and some new ones that
may complicate the international sit
uation, is Imminent in the house.
Friends of the literacy test measure,
which probably will be brought on the
floor late this week, boasted yesterday
that they had enough votes to pass it
over another veto by the president,
which is confidently expected if the
bill reaches him. Supporters of the
Asiatic exclusion bills are making a
detemined effort to have one of them
reported, despite the.purpose of the
state department to prevent consider
ation of any such legislation this sea
son. Chairman Burnett of the Immi
gration committee said yesterday he
expected one of these measures would
be reported next week. He hopes
that either his bill or that of Repre
sentative Baker of California can be
amended so as to cause the state de
partment to withdraw opposition.
As it probably will be reported, the
Asiatic exclusion measure would be
without many of the features to
whicfo the state department objects,
but would require both Chinese and
Japanese to register upon entering the
United States. The present "gentle
men's agreement" with Japan regard
ing the entrance of laborers, would
not be disturbed.
Such legislation, Mr. Burnett de
clares, would eliminate among other
things the Japanese "picture bride"
practice which he says is a growing
evil.<p></p>CORR

Petrograd, Feb. 23.—Addressing
the Duma with Emperor Nicholas,
Foreign Minister Sazonoff reviewed
the war sitvation in the most opti
mistic way, although he declared that
it Is more difficult now than ever be
fore to forsee the end of the world
struggle.
"The imperial government remains
unshaken in its determination to con
tinue the struggle to conquer the
enemy," Sazonoff said. "This war is
the greatest crime of high treason
against humanity.
Bear Heavy Responsibility.
"Those who provoked it bear a
heavy responsibility, and today stand
entirely unmasked. We know who it
was who let loose the misfortunes
without, number with which Europe is
oppressed. Even German public
opinion is beginning to realize that
the German people have been the
dupe of those who thought the hour
had come to realise the dreams of
plunder and rapine they had cherish
ed so long."
The speech of Emperor Nicholas
.was devoted principally to thanksgiv
ing and congratulation upon the Rus
sian vtctory at Erzerum.
Sasonoff. during his long address,
spoke of various International prob
lems. Taking up the Polish problem
he said:
"From the beginning of the war,
Russia has had inscribed on her ban
ner, the reunion of dismembered Po
land, and never has this ceased to be
our aim.
"Germany has granted a few minor
concessions to Poland, and in return
It is said she contemplates raising
hundreds of thousands of Polish
troops, to be used in the attempt to
bring about the triumph of German
ism."
Relations With Sweden.
In regard to Russian relations to
Sweden, Sazonoff said:
"Our only sentiment toward the
Swedes is one of sincere friendship
any pretext of conflicting interests
could only be artificial. Russia's his
tory does not impel her towards the
coast of Scandinavia. She must ob
tain an outlet in a free sea in quite
another direction."
On the subject of Russian-Ameri
can relations, he said:
American Industry.
"The interest which American in
dustry has in our markets permits of
the hope that in addition to the
friendly political relations now exist
ing between the two countries, an
economic re-approachment may be
brought about which would be of the
greatest benefit to both nations.
"In any case, the Russian govern
ment will put forth all its efforts to
this end."
He then referred to "the maladroit
and importunate propaganda of Ger
man agents in America." which he
said, "not only failed In its object,
but provoked a certain Irritation and
appreciable chilled American sym
pathies for Germany."
