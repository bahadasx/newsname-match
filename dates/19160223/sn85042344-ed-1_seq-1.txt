Representing Himself as

Said He Was Tulsa Editor
arid Had the Money "to
Close the Deal."
SOME one represent lug himself to
be Eugene Lorton culled up Fred
Livingston ut his homo near Buyer
over tho long distance telephone from
Okluhomu City about 9 o'clock Mon
day night and wnnted to know how
the delegation from Beckham county
to tho Seventh congressional district
Republican convention, which meets
Suturduy at Hobart, stood between
Harris and McGraw for nutionul com
, mltlceman. Mr. Livingston, never
having met Mr. Lorton, took an
evasive position and the party repre
senting himself to lie Mr. Lorton then
si u ted that he hud tho cash und stood
ready to buy tho delegation for Mc
Qraw and wunted to know how much
It would take. A number of people
were listening over tho It. F. D. lino
- ami It is said can verify the conversa
tion. Mr. Lorton wus not in Okla
homa City after 2 o'clock Monday aft
ernoon und at the time of the alleged
conversation was at tho Grand theater
in Tulsa In plain viow ot a crowded
house of Tulsa people who are all
more or less 'acquainted with him and
his presence here can be established
beyond the question of a doubt. Ho
had no long distance communication
with Mr. Livingston or anyone else
either from Oklahoma City or Tulsa ut
liny time Monduy or Monduy night or
any other time. The whole trans
lation ts a contemptible framcup and
shows the lengths to which the sup
porters of Jim Harris ure going In
order to put him over for nutionul
committeeman.
May Discover Parly.
The manager of the Oklahoma City
telephone exchange stated to George
F. Bell, tho locul manager of tho ex
change In Tulsa, at 7 o'clock lust
Vlght, that the records for the long
distance culls ut Oklahoma City for
Monday and Monduy night had been
locked up but thut ho would go over
them early this morning and ascertain
if possible from what phone number
the long distance call for Mr. Liv
ingston was put in. Unless a public
fay station was usedJ it wlil be eisy
to trace tho record und locuto the
-guilty purty.
Mr. Lorton was In Oklahoma City
f'-unduy night and until the de
parture, of the Frisco trail' at 2:45
o'clock Monday afternoon and oc
cupied a seat tho entire distance, to
Tulsa with Willium lllggins of Bait
lcsville. Alva McDonald, who is managing

bills in the lobby of the Sklrvln hotel
about noon Monday and was offering
to bet $100 that Harris had a ma
jority of the delegates to the Seventh
congressional district convention.
Make Dirty Fight.
As a mutter of fact more than a ira
Jority of the delegates were known to
have been opposed to Harris when
they were selected, but during Sundiiy
vicious and malicious stories about
MeQraw's religious beliefs wero cir
culated over the district together with
""promises of political patronage and It
wus doubtful just what would be the
outcome of tho convention. The ef
fort to prejudice delegates ugainst
MoUrnw by fuke telephone communi
cuik.ns such as the one framed up In
the name of Mr. Lorlon indicates the
desperate situation the Hutrls forces
nre facing and the dispicuble methods
to which they ure resorting In order
to retain control of a small section of
the ktute which they have been boast
ing wus absolutely dominated by thoni.
Alva McDonald was directly re
sponsible for the defeat of John
Fields for governor In the last elec

would have prevented tho passage of

KILLED IX
DEMOCRATS LOSE MORE VOTES
That the recent action of the legislature In passing a hill
that Imposes a three per cent tax on crude oil was approved by
the administration and the Democratic party as a whole, waa
shown yesterdny when a resolution introduced- by Pat .M alloy and
asking for fair play for the oil men, was voted down by thu
State League of Young Men's Democratic clubs In convention
assembled.
. Malloy and the Tulsa crowd were Jeered and hissed when
they attempted to speak on the resolution. In spite of this they
fell into line and marched behind their hand up one aisle and
down the other, cheering tho while.
The resolution that met with the disapproval of the young
Democrats of Oklahoma was as follows:
Whereas, tho production of oil and gas Is one of the sub
stantial Industries of the state of Oklahoma und constitutes the
chief substance of the citizenship of the northeastern part of the
tate,
And, whereas, It Is a doctrine of democracy nnd a prlnciplo
of the American government that all persons and their property
shall before the law be equal,
And, whereas, the recent legislature unwisely and without a
true understanding of the unjusthess of their act, has, by a house
bill No. 1, approved the 14th day of February, 1916, laid an un
just, unequal and burdensome tux upon the gross production of
oil, to-wit, three per cent thereof, whereas, said bill has reposed
in the state board of equalization the power to reduce In a given
case the rate of three per cent upon such gross production.
Now, therefore, be it resolved, by the Young Men's Demo
cratic League of Oklahoma, In convention assembled, that we
regret as Democrats and citizens the enactment of a measure
that so plainly discriminates against the oil -Interests of this
state and places upon that industry and its people an unequal
part of the burden of government. We pledge this convention to
exert every honest endeavor to secure the repeal of the present
gross production bill so as to bring the tax to at least two per
cent of the gross production and we respectfully recommend to
the state board of equalization the urgent necessity of making,
upon their own Initiative a true Investigation, believing as we do
that when such an investigation la made, said board must ascer
tain the fact to be that the present rate of taxation la too great
and should be reduced.

CLARENCE MARKHAM of pryor
Creek, a dark horse, was elected
president of tne Young Men's League
of Dcmocrutlc clubs of Oklahoma at
8:::0 o'clock last night, following the
most turbulent convention in the
history of the organization.
The fight thut precipitated riotous
scenes und all but sounded the death
kr.ell of the league was eaused by
tho rival candidacy of Fred (Mink)
Capshaw of Claremore and Henry
Wood of Muskogee for president. All
afternoon the delegates wrangled. At
S:t0 o'clock a perfect bedlam broke
loose. President Allen Street gave
up all hope of trying to preserve or
der, and until after dark Convention
hall was tho scene of eur-splltting
disorder.
Although Cii pshaw received more
votes than Wood on roll call, so
many of the unit votes were chal
lenged by both sides that it was im
possible to elect either man. After
muny conferences both candidates
withdrew In fnvor of Markham, whose
name hud not previously been men

in the league.
Melton the Savior.
The tact and diplomuc yof Alger
Melton, chuirmun of the Democratic
stato central committee, wus all that
saved the league from going on the
rocks. Melton succeeded In bringing
Capshaw and Wood together and get
ting them to agree on u compromise
candidate.
All during the convention the
Muskogee delegation displayed bitter
animosity towurd Tulsa. They opposed
bitterly the attempt iff Tulsa county
to seut 22 delegates, but were
whipped. When they found that
Wood had received less votes than
Capshaw for president their Indigna
tion knew no bounds and they pro
ceeded to hurl vile epithets toward
the Tulsa delegation, with resultant
confusion that caused President Street
to cry out above the turmoil:
"You are making fifteen thousand
Republican votes in 15 minutes. My
heart Is breaking as I gaze upon this
disgraceful scene and I uin afraid our
organization is disrupted and per
manently destroyed."

The old structure is well known to .Spiritualists all over the United Slates. In December, 1817, John D. Fox
and family, who lived In the dwelling, begun to hear mysterious rupplngs. Tho rapplngs continued until the
end of the following March, when one of tho children discovered that tho knocks would reply to finger rap
pings. Questions wero asked and the answers were rapped out. When tho discovery was noised abroad
a belief that Intercourse could be obtained with tho spirit world became epidemic and numerous "spirit circles"
were formed In various purls of the I'nited Stales. Tho manifestations thus said to be received were rupplngs,
tuble turnings, musical sounds, writings, the unseen raising of heavy bodies and tho like. Tho belief spread to
several parts of tho world, and In 1KM a spiritualistic ulllunco wus founded In London. It wus incorporated
in 18U6.
