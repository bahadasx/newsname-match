Trains Involved.
The trains involved were No. 79. the
Greenfield express, which is scheduled
as the Connecticut River special, and
No. 5, a local train for way points be
tween New Haven and New York, as
the former runs through to the latter
city without station stops.
Broken Air Hose the Cause.
A broken air hose on the express
between the electric motor which was
hauling it and the leading car stalled
the train on the westerly end of a
curve and rock cut near the Woodmont
station, and while there the local
which was following rounded the curve
and crashed into it at forty miles an
hour.
Claimed Engineman Ran Past Signal.
It is claimed that W. R. Curtis. tlo
engineman of No. 5, ran past a cau
tionary signal 2,000 feet in the rear of
the express, and when he saw the
home signal 300 feet in the rear of the
express he could not hold his train and
in an instant had rounded the curve
and not only were two passenger trains
in confusion but a freight train which
was passing west on the next track
Just at that moment was buckled up
by wreckage through upon it.
Flagman Ground to Death.
Of many examples of fortitude and
commendable deeds done during the
trying moments which accompanied
the wreck, it is said that the death of
George I. Tourtellote,, flagman on
the stalled train, stood out prominent
ly. According to the story told. Tour
tellotte went back with his red flag
and saw the local approaching. He
6tood in the track waving the flag un
til it was too late to escape and he was
ground to death a moment before the
awful crash came to the stalled ex
press. Other Wrecks of Like Nature.
The peculiarity of the wreck in that
it involved a freight train was not
without a parallel on the system. The
first disaster in the long series which
befell the company was on the Fair
field viaduct a few miles west on June
8, 1911, when a freight ran into another
stalled train, both bound west. Just
when two freight trains were passing
the point bound east. The impact
caused the stalled freight train to
buckle, and cars were thrown over
involving the other trains. Then fol
lowed a few days later the Federal ex
press wreck, with twelve persons kill
ed, including the engineman, A. M.
Curtis, who is not thought to have
been related to Engineman Curtis who
died at the throttle today. The wrecks
on the road followed with distressing
frequency until the series was ended
on Sept. 2, 1913, at North Haven, when
the Bar Harbor express was run into
by the White Mountain express and
twenty persons died. That was the
day that Howard Elliott became presi
dent of the system, and no accident
with loss of life to passengers had
come until this wreck today. Four of
the greater wrecks on the road in
which many lives were snuffed out
were of the rear-end kind.
Trains Were Both Off Schedule.
The two trains involved in today's
wreck were both oft schedule upon ar
rival here from the east. No. 5, the
local, was eleven minutes late, and
The express left at 11.09 and the
local at 11.10, the latter having station
stops to make. At Woodmont the ex
press was three minutes in the lead
and had crossed over to the outside
westbound track so a freight could
proceed west on the inner track.
It was this freight which
was Involved in the wreck. The official
time shows that the express passed
Woodmont at 11.19 and the local went
by at 11.22. Beyond Woodmont is the
curve on which at the westerly end
the express became stalled.
Makeup of the Express.
The makeup of the express was a
heavy engine, three steel coaches, three
Pullmans, and then another steel coach
added at New Haven. The crew were
jonn j. K.ennedy, engineer; Charles
Courts, fireman; George L. Tourtel
lotte, flagman, and E. T. Bray, con
ductor. The local had a smaller en
gine and five wooden coaches, three
having been added at New Haven to
accommodate the large number of per
sons bound for way points. The crew
were W. R, Curtis, engineman: Ed
ward McGinnis, fireman, and W. B.
Brandt, conductor.
Express Stalled on a Curve
The express had been stalled on the
curve out of sight of the straight
away track from the Woodmont sta
tion. Three hundred feet behind It
was a signal ' which served as the
"home" signafor No. S and 3,000 feet
further back was another protecting
signal for No. 79 which was the cau
tionary signal to No. 6. Trainmen
