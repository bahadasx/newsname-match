officer could not see the airships but
heard the noise of the engines, and tel
ephoned to the battery base whence
the news was forwarded to the army
corps headquarters. All the batteries
were on the alert and shortly search
lights were sweeping the heavens,
"The Zeppelins were first sighted by
an officer commanding a battery of 75
mlllimetre guns. The nearest then was
about two miles oft flying at an alti
tude of about 5,000 feet and rising
rapidly. The second Zeppelin was some
three miles behind the first. The offi
cer was unable to get the elevation
necessary to hit the airships but he
managed to give the exact position to
the searchlight operators. From that
moment the first dirigible was never
lost to view. As it was moving against
the wind its progress

Little Probability of Adoption of Gore's
Resolution to Warn Amerieana Off

Lodge* Formal Protest Against Seiz
ure of Steamahip Appam by United
States Deputy Marshala.
Washington, Feb. 23.—President Wil
son Is unchanged In his opposition to
having congress passing any resolution
warning Americans to keep off armed
merchantmen of the European bellig
erents, and congress leaders have been
so advised. It was stated authorita
tively today that discussion of such a
move did not come up at the confer
ence of the president Monday night
with Chairmen Stone and Flood, of the
congress committees of foreign affairs,
and Democratic Leader Kern, but was
revived in quite another way.
The official account is that Senator
Smith, of Georgia, recently went to
Senator Stone to discuss the form In
which- such a resolution might be intro
duced. It was said Senator Stone op
posed such a resolution.
Congressmen who were at the White
House today said there was consider
able discussion of Senator Gore's res
olution to warn Americans off bellig
erent merchantmen but that there was
very little prospect of passing' It un
less desired by the administration.
Formal Protest by Germany.
Formal representations were made to
the state department today by the Ger.
man embassy against the proceedings
brought In the federal courts at Nor
folk to return the captured British
liner Appam to hor owners.
In a note presented by Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador, it
Is contended that many precedents as
well as the terms of the Prussian
Anterieitr treaty provide that no legal
acf^jtQ can lle jftgalnat\tHe Appant^held
by a German crew as a prize of war,
nor agajnst Lieutenant Berg, her com
mander. It is also contended th»t inas
much as Lieutenant Berg has extra
territorial rights no legal action can lie
against him.
The note suggests that when tho
case comes up in court, March 2, that
the state department inform the court
of the terms of the treaty.
Want Trained Young Men.
"The military affairs Committee is
of the opinion that we do not need a

schools in the various states.
