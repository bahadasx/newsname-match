PLAN TO EVADE
TEUTON DISPUTE
President Opposes Legislation
Prohibiting Americans from
Boarding Armed Ships.
HOTLY REJECTS SCHEME
Turns Down Proposal of Par
ty Leaders to Relieve Ad
minstration of Risk.
WOULD FORCE GERMANY'S HAND
Chief Executive Determined That Ber
lin Acknowledge Right of U. S.
Citizens to Travel in Safety.
President Wilson has emphatically re
jected proposals from members of his
party in Congress which would relieve
him of the responsibility of forcing an
issue with Germany over the new Berlin
submarine declaration. Such proposals
took the form of suggested legislation
prohibiting American citizens from trav
eling on armed merchantmen.
The suggestions were laid before the
President by Chairmen Stone and Flood.
of the Senate and House Foreign Affairs
committees, respectively, and by Majority
Leader Kern. of the Senate, at a con
ference held at the White House on Mon
day night.
The President rejected the proposals
uithout qualification. and the conferees
came away from the White House with
the. understanding that it was Mr. Wil
son' irm intention to insist upon a clean
c t settlement of the submarine contro
S-rsy on the basis of the present law and
farts in the case.
Members of Congress who yesterday
heard some of the details of the con
ference declared that the President
1: prepared to insist upon the with
l awal by Germany of her declaration
rf intention to torpedo without warn
in all armed enemy merchant ships
Cfter March 1.
The President was desertibed as de
t.-rmined that Germany must acknowl
era the right of American citizens
t, travel in safety on the high seas,
r. hethl the ships they use be un
ariml or armed for defense, bellig
trerst or neutral.
ie I resident is said to have shown
g e,: impatience over the delay that
aready has occurred in the subma
r n i ne gotiations and to have inti
i.ated to the members of Congress
that the lives of American citizens
hase already been too long in
jeopardy.
Hetly Spuas Suggesteon.
I emocrats in the Senate were under
the distinct Impression that the Presi
dent had just about made up his
riur.i that the time for parleying was
over ard that there must be a definite
understanding between Germany and
the United States In the near future
If friendly diplcmatic relations be
tween th. two countries are to con
tinue.
The conference at the White House
Monday night. it was learned. was
Initiated by Chairman William J.
Stone. of the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee. When the President
was informed of the Senator's request
for an appoietanent and learned that
the Senator wished to discuss with him
the German situation, he at once de
cided to call in Senator John W. Kern.
of Indiana, the Senate majority leader,
and Chairman Flood, of the House
Committee on Foreign Affairs.
The three Democrats called in a body.
They had with them a copy of a joint
resolution introduced in the Senate about
the first of the year by Senator Gore, of
Oklahoma. prohibiting American citizen
from traveling on belligerent liners. II
was learned that the visitors laid the
resolution before the President with the
suggestion that its passage would relieve
the administration of the embarrassment
of taking the position that merchant ves
eels have the right to arm and of insist
tag on this right In face of the new Ger
man declaration and in face of the argu
ments to the contrary which Secretar
Lansing laid before the entente powers
The President. it is stated, hotly spurn
ed the suggestion, declaring that the pas
sage of such a resolution would not onl3
be contrary to the intentions of the ad
ministration, but would be regarded b:
him as Insulting. The confer.. are said
to have been somewhat taken aback by
the heat displayed by the President.

Baltimore, Feb. 22.-Cardinal
Gibbons in an interview today
said:
"1 am strongly opposed to any
State-wide prohibition bill, be
cause I believe such a law can
not be enforced in a city like
Baltimore.
"A law of this kind interferes
with the personal liberty and
rights and creates hypocrisy in
the people. The history of the
world demonstrates that man al
ways will use intoxicating liquors.
"However, I am heartily in
favor of temperance. I am also
a firm believer in local option."

BE PROLONGED
Berlin Likely to Ask U. S. to
Argue Over "Offensive and
Defensive Armament."
STATE DEPARTMENT WILLING

Compromise Suggested.
Preliminary advice, from Berlin yes
terday forecasted one probable concee
slon in the forthcoming communication
on the submarine question that may
lead to further diplomatic negotiation.
The German government's reply to the
recent memorandum setting forth this
governments position on the armed
merchantmen question, according to these
advices, will include a suggestion that
the United States enter into a discus
sion of what constitutes ofeadve and
defensive armament.
Whether the United States will ac
cept this suggestion. State Department
officials were not prepared to say. At
present the only concession which the
State Department ses- wiAjg s ahe
is to consider that a wased witha
mounted forward is armed for ofense
and Is properly an auxiliary cruiser.
There is a disposition in official circles,
however, to believe that a compromise
between the two governments may be
worked out oi the following general
lines:
Germany to admit the principle that
armed merchantmen may not be as
sumed to be armed for offensive pur
poses.
With this admitted, the United States
would be willing to make a question of
any particular case in which Germany
should sink a merchantman.
Count von Bernstorif, the German Am
bassador, returned to Washington from
New York yesterday. He said he had
no appointment to see Secretary of State
Lansing. He expects to make an ap
pointment, however, as soon as the com
munication from Berlin arrives. There
was reason to believe that it will be
received today or at least by tomorrow.

London. Feb. 22.-For the eccond suc

the French lines.
On Monday they captured !0 yards of
first line French positions In Artois. To
day they occupied the Haumont Woods
and a French salient north of Beau
mont, in the Verdun region. Official ad
mission of both losses was made in
the reports of the French war office
issued during the day.
The intense activity of the Germans
north of Verdun is the subject of dis
cussion by the military critics of all
Paris newspapers. The consensus of
ojinion Is that the German are bent
on another desperats effort to capture
Verdun.
The fall of this fortress would force
open the road from Mets to Rheims and
remove the menace from the southern
lines of communication of the Germans
in France. Thus compelling a retirement
of the French front.

FEDERALIZED MILITIA PLAN
RIDICULED AS INADEQUATE
Massachusetts Congressman Introduces
Bill Calling for Standing
Army of 281.000.
A bitter fight against the federalised
militia plan evolved by Chairman Hay
and agreed to in general terms by the
members of the House military affairs
committee was foreshadowed yesterday
In a statement issued by Representative
Gardner. of Massachusetts.
Mr. Gardner, who may be taken to rep
resent iS some measure the movement
for adequate national defense, displayed
his otoosition to the program of the
House committee in two ways. He is
sued a statement ridiculing the proposal
to make national security dependent upon
an army composed of militiamen. and
indicated what, tramn his point of stew,
should be dene by introducing the Mil
drawn by the Army War Colnege. which
provides for a regular army of 31.000
men.
The Hay plan. Mr. Gardner said. which
will be more satisfactory to William J
Bryan than to Gen. Leonard Wood. pro
vides for an increase of S.' men in
the regular army. This force. h" adds.
would be sufficient to man a trench seven
miles long or half the length of Man
hattan Island.
With as much emphasis he declared the
scheme for a federalised militia to be
equally inadequate. He asserts that it
will he a long time before the 425.04
militiamen proposed by the Hay measure
can be enlisted inasmuch as there have
never been more than 130.000 men in the
militia forces of all the States.
In this he is supported to some extent
bv militia offcers themselves who testi
fied before the Military Affairs Commit
tee of both the Senate and House that it
will probably be impossible to recruit
more than 30.000 men.
Mr. Gardner reiterates the charge that
the militia forces will be in effect forty
eight separate little armies under the
State government. and inat any attempt
to draft them in time of war will be met
with a lawsuit or an alibi.
