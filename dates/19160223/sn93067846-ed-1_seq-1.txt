GREAT BRITAIN S SEA FORCE
FOUR TIMES THAT OF UNITED
STATES.
Twice as Strong as Combined Fleet?
of Germany and Austria?France
A!m> Has Added Greatly to Naval
Strength?Japan's Fleet Growing.
Washington, Feb. 18.?The British
navy today is approximately twice as
strong as the combined lleets of Ger?
many and Austria, while the Teutonic
combination iias Just about double the
sea fighting force of the United
States/ according to information in
the posseslon of the navy depart?
ment. The facts were disclosed to the
houae naval committee today by
Capt Josleh McKean of tho stafT of
the chfef of operations.
Capt. McKean also said the French
navy wan from 15 to 20 per cent,
stronger than tho American, accord?
ing to. latest information. He ex?
plained that these were rough es?
timates and that charts showing that
specific relations of the various navies
would be submitted later by Rear
Admiral Benson, the chief of opera?
tions.
Sn far as Is definitely known, the
captain told the committee, the Jap?
anese building programme adopted
several years ago and which will not
bo completed for several years to
come, provides for a modern fleet of
eight dreadnoughts and eight battle
cruisers. It was possible, ho added,
that additional building was in
progress as all nations but the United
States had building policies.
On the strength of the known pro?
gramme, however, Capt. McKean
said, Japan would have but 14 cap?
ital ships when the 17 American
dreadnoughts built, building or au?
thorised were commissioned.
The witness disagreed with Hear
Admiral Grant, chief of submarines,
as to tie advisability of abandoning
the pre* ent smaller submarine types
in favor of the 800 ton boats. He be?
lieved 80 of the large boats should be
I built an I attached to the fleets, but
that sma ller ones should operate from
^mmmmmtv m.
ten als a long the coasts. '

William Crosier, chief of army ord?
nance, giving his views on the Tin?

Crosier said, the act was too sweep?

made today before the senate
tary committee by Senator Robim
or Arkansas. He declared that,
service was "contemptibly inefftclei
i.nd that its head, Lieut. Col. Samuel
Reber, not only was making no effort
to improve it but deliberately JrOs
preventing the facts from reaching
his superiors.
The senator appeared before she,
committee with a mass of datalin
cludlng photographic copies of letters
which, he said, had been exchanged
between Col. Reber and Capt. Artjiur
S. Cowan, commanding the aviafton
station at San Diego. At least part
of this evidence was produced be|pre
the courtmartlai at San Francisco
which recently tried Lieut. Col. Lewis
E. Qoodier, judge advocate general
of tho Western department, accused
of improperly altering certain charges
tiled by other officers against Capt.
Cowan. j *
The committee will act Monday on
Senator Robinson's resolution for an
investigation. Senator Chamberlain,

CONTROVERSY OVER THE WHITE

A -
tTllmJngton Star.
Speaking for the general adjustment
jjeommittee of the Order of Railway
pC?nductors on the Atlantic Coast Line, i
Mr. W. M. Clark, third vice-president
of the National organization, in a
lengthy statement, made public in
Wilmington yesterday morning, replies
to a statement made last week to the
conductors of the road by President
J. It. Kenly regarding the White
Audit system.
Denial is made that the trainmen
are seeking to dictate the method un?
der which the Atlantic Coast Line
J Railroad Company shall conduct its
business and it is pointed out that
the general adjustment committee has
gone on record as recognizing the
right of the management of the A. C.
L. to inaugurate and maintain a sys?
tem of auditing trains, and It Is de?
clared that the conductors have giv?
en assurance of their hearty co-opera?
tion In having a "fair and proper aud?
it."
The text of circular 33, giving the
details of the new audit system and
the manner in which it shall be con?
ducted is included In the statement. It
Is pointed out that the Southern Rail?
way put in effect in July of last year
an audit system for checking their
conductors, conducted by bona fide
iconductors, but that this was not made
affective until after the matter was
fully discussed with representatives
e"f the conductors, which it is stated
was not done by the Coast Line. Ob?
jection is made to the White Audit
system on the ground that it carries
with it the opportunity for espionage
t-and ostentation.
*In conclusion we wish to say,"*
the statement concludes, "it 1b the
cy of the Order of Railway Con
a>man?,
Practically all of the higher offi?
ciate of the Atlantic Coast Line were
out of tho city yesterday, but it is not
thought that they will have any reply
to make to the statement of the con?
ductors now, as Judge William A.
Chambers, of tre Board Of Mediation
and Conciliation, \vi!! be in Wilming
ItOn tomorrow to use hi? good office?
\ in bringing about a settlement of the
'controversy.
"We are simply marking time now

tomorrow," said Mr. Clark last night.
"We have presented our side of the
question and shall have nothing more
to say until there are further develop

j Washington, Feb. 18.?Germany's
; response to the latest request of the
'united States for assurance that sub?
marine warfare will be conduc/ ,t
'accordance with principles of if m i
! tional law is expected to b* 5 rat
[statement that assurances p M jsly
(given in the l.usitania an< * abia

merchantmen and that th ? srnian
government must feel ceV O .hat its
submarine which warns/ ? >rchant
man will not be attac/??* /'urthcr
! more, the Berlip ford ** /ice prob
jably will ask the Unit/' #cs for its
definition of defensive /ment.
Indications of what the German re?
ply may be are understood to have
been given |fn informal conversation
i between state department officials
and Teutonic diplomats since Ger?
many end Austria announced their in?
tention of sinking armed enemy mer
Chantment after February 29.
The United States today made its
first formal declaration that it does
not accept as legal the announced In*
itention of the Teutonic powers when
[the State department sent to dip?
lomatic and consular representatives
j abroad, for their information, notifl
cations that this government con?
siders that merchant ships have a
right to carry defensive armament.
In this connection it became known
that the Swedish government had in?
structed Us consular officers to ad?
vise all Swedish subjects preparing to
embark on vessels of the entente al
i lies of the warning given by Germany
and Austria.
It is considered certain that the
question of defining, defensive arma?
ment will be the basis of lengthy
negotiations with the central powers;
beginning when the reply Is received
\M> Xha.m^age outlining the views at
the United States which Count vort
Bernstorff, the German ambassador,
has sent his government. The re?
sponse is not expected before the last ,
:>f next week.
It was admitted at the state depart
I Rtent today that the question of writ?
ing a formal note on the subject of the
contact of submarine warfare, after
the complete German declaration and
its appendix have been received, was
under consideration. It is certain
that Austria also will be supplied with
the views of the United States.
Eleven days remain before German
and Austrian submarine commanders
begin to put into Cifeet their new in
1 structions unless the date for the
opening of the new campaign is post?
poned. While the United States is
said not to have asked for a postpone?
ment the German ambassador is be?
lieved to have called the attention of
his government to the fact that, the
?complete appendix forming the basis
ef the German declaration has not yet
had time to reach the stare depart?
ment and for this reason a postpone?
ment would not be surprising.
Officials also are awaiting copies
of the confidential instructions to at?
tack submarines which the German
government alleges have been given
to the commanders of British mer-.
chant ships.
In this connection it was stated in
German circles tonight that evidence
in their possession led to the con?
clusion that all British merchant
ships, with the possible exception of
those in trans-Atlantic trade, had in
' structions, to resist capture.
It was pointed out that the Clan
MacTavish, sunk by the raider Moewe,
the raptor of the Appam, had fought
With her guns until she went down. It
also was declared that aboard tho
Appam was found a document con?
taining instruction, "To all British
horn sea captains" and setting forth
"that any submarine approaching a
merchant vessel may be treated as
hostile."
Secretary Lansing made it clear to?
day that the arangement under
which defensively armed Italian ships
had been permitted to leave American
ports did not in any way require the
United States to sacrifice any prin?
ciple or tend to establish precedent.
He said thai the ships had been al?
lowed to Mill under a temporary ar?
rangement.
