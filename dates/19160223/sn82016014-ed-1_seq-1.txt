Six ' Years of Plundering Has
Stripped the Country.
Washington. Feb. 23. Reports re
ceived in Washington during the past
few days point strongly to the collapse
of the the Carranzista government in
Mexico in the near future. The re
ports not only come from responsible
individuals along the border, but from
American consular officials in Mexico
itself.
According to this information, con
ditions throughout northern Mexico in
Sonora, Chihuahua and Coahuila, as
well as in more southern states, are
rapidly approaching a climax in which
the local authorities appointed by Car
ransa will find themselves helpless.
The principal difficulty in which the
de facto government is said to find
itself is a lack of sufficient money to
meet the pay roll of the constantly de
creasing Carranza army. Only the fact
that Villa and all the other bandii
revolutionists are themselves nearly
penniless, accounts for the continuance
of Carranza's nominal power, the re
ports say.
Country Picked Clean.
After six years of plundering, the
Mexican looters have picked the coun
try clean, it is said. Willing enlisters
in any cause and under any leadership
that promise fresh spoils find them
selves forced to remain quiescent un
der Carranza's chieftainship merely
because there is no other leader in
sight who is in better financial shape.
Desertions from Carranza's army
are becoming more and more frequent,
however, according to these reports,

small detachments which were placed

numbers o new recruits are rapidly
assuming unbearable proportions.

exceeded $200,000,000 in 1915; but the allied powers do not intend to spend
that much here this year, as their own munitions factories are growing.

'WILL GET SOME BISHOP HERE'
He Writes From Portland, Ore.
Looks Genuine.
Would Like to Glye Police Chief
"Some Soup."
Chicago, Feb. 23. A postcard bear
ing the apparently authentic signature
of Jean Crones, avowed principal in
the anarchist soup plot, received by
Police Chief Healey today, threatened
death for some bishop "at Portland,
Oregon," from where the card was
dated. The postmark was Portland,
Feb. 18.
Healey, though not convinced the
card was signed by Crones, said the
signature apparently was genuine.
The postcard read:
"Portland 2-19-16. To Chief Polis,
Chicago.
'I see you are still after me. Why
don't you come out after me. Mabey
I can give you some soup. Look out
for sometink to happen heer soon. I
wish I had got the old bishop and
judge with the soup, but mabey I get
him yet. I will get some bishop here,
I guess. You look. My true print. I
always go bom on me. Whoever ar
ests me will blow up with me. Jean
Crones."
Tates Card Ahead.
The fact that Crones dated his card
Feb. 19, though the Portland, Ore.,
postcard was dated Feb. 18, was deem
ed by the police evidence that Crones
was dating his taunting messages a
day ahead of their date of mailing in
an effort to deceive the police.
"It may be the work of a joker.'
Chief Healey said, "but you never can
tell."

she replied.
" I prefer to wear my stripes up
and down, and not around the body
when I do wear them,' I told her."
Mrs. Rowe denied the charges of a
padded pay roll.
"After my talk with Mrs. Rowe I
went over to the office of Seymour
Stedman, my lawyer. I told him about
Mrs. Rowe's proposal," said Mrs.
Katon.
" 'Steddie, I said, 'did you ever hear
of such an insult? What does she
take me for? Can you beat it?'
" 'Why didn't you biff her one on

i ment.

Miss Ai.itiel Vernon, organizer for the

in a few day9 for Wyoming to lieKin a
crusade similar to the one launched
I in this flate. The withdrawal of Mis

Shortly before the me-tin? in Rep
resentative hall this afternoon. Miw
Vernon announced her plan to leave
Kansas. She may not return to the
state. The fiftht which she has started,
however, will not stop. Miss Vernon
was quite sure of that. Miss Doris
Stevens, who came from New York
to assist in the organization work to-
day, was also certain the fight in Kan-
fus would be a battle to the finish.
Work ;oes Hiht On.
"1 expect to leave Kansas in a few
days." Miss Vernon announced. "But
'Jio work n Kansas will go right on.
Make sine of that. We will never vtop
.- nrt until we have won."
Then Miss- Vernon outlined a plan
which means that the congresMonal
union will attack both the Democratic
convention and to not n stale convt-n-x
ions. Kven county convention will
be visited. These trips will be for but
fine purpose? to force an adoption of
the Vernon resolution calling on con
grow to adopt the Susan IS. Anthony
rest.-tut ion and to urge a member of
i the Kansas delegation in Washington
! to read nt" lV ronKTMonal u"cur,i-
! a copy of the document.
To Visit Kvery Convention;
"We will send workers to every con
gressional convention "ven to the
county conventions in many invian'j."
declared Miss Vernon. "Both ptate
conventions will be aked to adopt our
icsolution. We are sure they will see
the wiwlrm of such action."
Both Miss Vernon and Miss Stvfn
today expressed surprise that th
Democratic state committee had fal
lowed the suggestion of Ir. Kva Hard
ing of Topeka and had refused to
adopt the national suffrage resolution.
But if the Democrats really meant it
if they really did well, they w ill yet
hear from the union. Make no niiiy
tnke tat.cut it. ,
"Surely those men will think better
1 ' of the matter and some of the coolt-r
heads of the party will see that tha
state committee acted hastily." anx-
i inusly suggested Miss Vernon today in
discussing the vot which H-nt her
resolution to the scrap heap. "Why. t
was surprised. I could hardly believe
that the committee would entirely re
fuse to act.
"What do the leaders think of th
matter? Surely they do nt approve?'
Those wre some of the xpreHiona
rrom Miss Vernon and Miss Stevens ua
they talked today of thir defe-it.
Murphy Was Nice.
Miss Vernon, though, expressed p
preciation for the courteous treatment
extended by E. K. Murphy, chairman
of the state committee. She address!

not attend the meeting.
"Oh, he was just the most courtntui

TAX B00ZEj1,000 GAL
Kx-Govenmr Sulzer of X. Y. l--lares
Loral Option Is a Fraud.
Pittsburg, Pa., Feb. 23. A tax of
$1,000 a gallon on all alcoholic liquora
was advocated by former Governor
William Sulzer of New York in an ad
dress here tonight before the Penn
sylvania state Prohibition convention.
He assailed the principle of local op
tion and condemned the Hobson pro
hibition amendment.
"Local option is a fraud, sai'l Mr.
Sulzer. "It is like a dog chasing it
tail. It is like squatter sovereignty.
The quickest way to abolish this liquor
traffic iniquity is to pass a lw through
congress taxing until you kill it."
