NICARALIAN TREAT
RATIFIED BY SENATE
FIVE DEMOCRATS OPPOSE AND 15 S
REPUBLICANS VOTE FOR
RATIFICATION.
OPTION ON CANAL ROUTE N
Also Naval Base in Gulf of Fonseca S
and Pays Nicarauga Government
$3,000000.
Washington.-The senate by a vote
of 55 to 18 ratified the long-pending
and persistently opposed Nicaraguan si
treaty, whereby the United States
would acquire a 99-year option on the a
Nicaraguan Canal route and a naval
base in the Gulf of Fonseca for $3,- m
000,000. h
Included in the ratification resolu- h
tion was a provision 'declaring that
the United States in obtaining the f
naval base does not intend to vio- a
late any existing rights in the Fon
seca Gulf of Costa Rico, Honduras M
and Salvador, which had protested t
against the groysed acquirement. -
Five Democratic senators voted b
against the treaty. They were Cham
berlain. Martine. Clarke of Arkansas,
Thomas and Vard-aman. Fifteen Re- 5'
publican senators joined the adminis
tration forces in support of the treaty.
Immediately after the senate ~ had
acted, Senator Chammorro, the Nic
araguan Minister, said he would at
once communicate with his govern
ment and that he expected ratifica
tion of the convention by his gov- ti
ernment would soon follow and ex- in
changes made to put the treaty in sy
force. of
Senator Clarke of Arkansas led the pi
Democratic opposition to the treaty, in
while the Republican opposition was to
headed by Senator Borah and Smith cc
of Michigan. of
During the long debate declarations cc
were made in the senate that Ger- p,
many had offered Nicaragua more than t2
had the United States for the canal o
route option, and this is said to have c<
been used as an argument for ratifica- tl
tion. bs
Senator Stone, chairman of the pi
Foreign Relations Committee, will tl
call up the Haitien financial portec- p
torate treaty next, this to be followed h<
by the amended Colombian treaty. se
Regarding the Colombian treaty there o0
is grave doubt whether it can receive ac
the necessary two-thirds vote for rati- pI
fication. re

it that the commissioner had an ac

tan $6,000 at the Union Nationa'
mk of Columbia. Senator Banks ex
ained that this money belonged to

The pursuit of the Turkish forces who
retreated from Erzerum is being con

prisoner what remained of the thirty
fourth Turkish division, with a large
quantity of war supplies.
An air raid by a squadron of Ital
lian machines against Laibach, Capi
tal of Carniola, Austria-Hungary, is
officially reported from Rome. Bombs
were dropped on the town, and they
are .tliouht to have done consider

DANIELS ASKS FOR MONEY.
Emergency Appropriation of $2,757,000
For Needed Repairs.
Washington.-A$2757,000 emergen
cy appropriation for repairs of macbin
ery in battleships, torpedo destroyers
and submari'*es, to increase the sup
ply of mines and, for the first time. to
equip battleships with anti-aircraft
guns was asked of Congress by Secre'
tary Daniels.
"Many of our destroyers have
reached an age where renewals of ex
tensive portions of their machinery
equipment Is necessary," Secretary
Daniels said. "The same is true of
submarines, both classes of vessels
making a big drain on this year's ap
propriation."
The boilers of the battleships Geor
gia and Virginia, both of which have
been in almost constant service for
ten years. have shown such weakness,
Mr. Daniels said, as to require that
these vessels be withdrawn from ac
tive service to h -e their boilers re
placed. In addi -on,7 the Virginia has
recently broken an important part of
her machinery, which must be re
newed, and the long stay of the fleet
in Mexican waters last year also caus

SCORES VOLUNTEER SYSTEM
Nothing More Than Mere Chance
Says C-en. Wood In Charleston.
Mien Must Be Trained.
Charleston.-The volunteer system
was severely scored and characterized
as nothing more than dependence on
mere chance by Maj. Gen. Leonard
Wood, U. S. A., commanding the De
partment of the East in. an address
to a big mass meeting at the Hi'oern
ian ill. The volunteer spirit is fine,
he said. but undependable. It has al
ways failed this nation, although not
many know it, because the histories
do not teach us the unpleasant facts,
he continued. Soldiers of the War Be
tween the States knew it, and know
that both the North and the South
fell back on the draft system be
fore many months of war.
Reviewing the wars of this nation
to prove the unreliability of the volun
teer system, Gen. Wood declared that
the United States had never engaged
in war with a first class military pow
er unassisted and that United States
armies had met defeat in engage
ments with a force numbering little
more than half their own.
In advocating federal control of the
National Guard, Gen. Wood declared
that the movement to put this force
under the federal government was no
reflection on the members or the of
ficers of the institution and that the
defects of the National Guard were
not the fault of officers or men, -but
were the simple results of too many
commanding officers. He declared
that the government wanted every of
ficer and every man of the National
Guard, rank for rank, in its plans for
military preparedness.
Citizens training camps ~and their
work were told of in the latter part
of the general's address. ,He urged
the people of this- section to respond
to the call for volunteers in the camp
-as they had always .responded when
the country called -upon them.
Meriweather Honored by State.
North Augusta.--With impressive
ceremonies the monument to the mem
ory of McKie Meriweather, erected by

The oratory of tbe day was Col. D.
S. Henderson of Aiken. The speaker
1s' the sole surviving member of coun
sel for the men charged with riot and
murder following the famous clash of
races at Hamburg in which McKie
Meriweather lost his life.
Col. Henderson's subject- was "The
White Man's Revolution in South
Carolina." He told of the events
leading to the uprising of the white
people at Hambui-g in July 18 and how
McKie Meriweather was the first man
to lose his life in the uprising which
drove t'ie carpetbagger and bummer
i of South Carolina and established
white rule.

IL 14th--FII
ELP CELEB
Appropriation Is $2,423,877.24
The aggregate of the appropriation
bill, as recommended by the senate
'finance committee, will be $2,423,
over the aggregate of the appropria
tions as adopted by the house.
The finance committee provides for
increases in more than 40 Items and
for decreases in five items, not includ
ing the large change of $50,000 in
crease made in the appropriation for
the State Hospital for the Insane.
The greatest alteration is made in
the sections for pensions, where in
addition to decreasing the amount of
pensions there is a $1,000 decrease in
the item of salaries; an increase of
$1,000 in maintenance and $1,100 is
repairs is provided for.
The finance committee also recom
mends two changes is the section on
public schools by decreasing the con
tingent fund for needy schools from
$50,000 to -$40,000 and by increasing
the appropriation for graded and con
solidated schools from $110,000 to
$125,000. This change conforms in
part with recommendations from the
state superintendent of education.
The committee leaves in the pro
vision creating emergency funds of
$50,000 for the enforcement of the
prohibition laws and $25,000 for the
payment of the shortage in militia
equipment.
An increase of $14,000 is recom
mended 4n the section providing for
the maintenance and- the erection of
buildings at the State reformatory in
Florence, over which until recently
there has been some misunderstanding
as to the necessity of state aid.
Having passed the Padgett substi
tute, requiring the fiscal agent of the
state board of charities and correc
tions to investigate the financial con
dition of the parents of boys and girls
attending state colleges, the finance
committee has recommended an in
crease of $2,945 for that institution
A similar increase of $3,000 is pro
vided for the state tax commission.
Throughout the bill the finance com
mittee in its proposed amendments
shows a tendency to increase salaries
and to provide for a 'number of inci
dental items; appropriations for re
pairs have also been increased over
the figures the house set.
Supports Two-Quart Measure.
The house refused on a yea and nay
vote of 55 to 44 to recommit the bill
by Senator Carlisle limiting the
amount of liquor to two quarts and of
beer to 60 pints a month. Opposition
to the stringency of the measure gain
ed strength over night and many
staunch supporters of prohibition voted
in favor of having the bill amended
so as to strike out some of the pro
visions that escaped amendment on
second. reading.
The bill provides among other sim
ilar stiplations that a person carry
ing whiskey in his satchel must have
it so stated on the satchel.
Mr. Searson moved to recommit the
"two-quarts-a-month" bill on the
ground that the bill carries a provision
that in case a person carries liquor in
his suitcase he must so state on the
suitcase. He argued that women fre
quently carry a flask while traveling.
He sa . that the electorate did not
want such restrictions placed on the
prohibition it voted for.
The senate placed its approval up
on the McCullough bill by a far great
er majority than had been anticipated
by its most ardent supporters. The
vote, whereby the senate refuse te
strike out the enacting words, was 31
to 11. The bill passed to third read
ing with notice of certain amendmients
whereby children whose labor may be
necessary for the support of indigeni
families or widows, may be excepted
The main fight, however, has already
been made, and the bill is certain
of passage in slightly modified forni
from that in which it came from the
house. The bill raises the age limit
from 12 to 14 years.
On a yea and nay vote of 53 to 24
the house tabled a motion to direci
the sergeant-at-arms to remove the
piano in the rotunda of the state
house.
A bill has been Introduced provid
ing for a capitationl tax of $1 upon all
dogs in Kershaw county.
Hammond Bill Killed.
The house reversed Its action by re
fusing to give a third reading to the
bill by Mr. Mammond providing foi
a election on the question of issuing
bonds for the improvement of roadi
in Richland county. Again the debate
was filled with "quasl-charges and In
nuendos," all of which were categori
cally denied. Two or three members
arose to points of personal privilege
The house refused passage of the bil
on a yea and nay vote of 65 to 3:
and the "clincher" was put on. The
Hammond bill had been substituted
on second reading for the majority
bill on a year and nay vote of 42 to 41
The committee on state house and
grounds has introduced a resolutlor
to authorize the clerk of the house t<
pay to Poindexter Page Carter, artist
$200 for the portraits of Robert E
Lee and "Stonedall" Jackson, whi
were exhibited in the vestibule of the
hall of the house.
New CIrcult.
A new judicial circuit was created
by action of the senate with the pas
sage of the house bill which propose'
the formation of the new circuit ou
of Hampton. Beaufort, Colleton an<
Jasper counties. Motion to strik<
out the enacting words by Senato:
Wightman of Saluda county was re
