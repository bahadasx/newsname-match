CHID LABOR BILL I
' BECOMES LAW
MEASURE TO BECOME EFFEC- s
TIVE JANUARY 1, 1917.?BY
LARGE MAJORITY.
Columbia, Feb. 18.?The McCullough
child labor bill, proposing to T
raise the age limit for employment of II
children in factory, mine or textile ir
plants from 12 to 14 years, passed ti
through the senate last night by an oi
overwhelming majority. As the bill
leaves the senate, the law is to be- f(
com? effective January 1, 1917, and
its provisions of general application ti
in both compulsory and non-compul- m
sory school districts.
In the original draft, the effective- pj
ness was accumulative. A proviso it
gave a six months' extension period w
from July 1, 1916 to January 1, 1917 n?
when children of 13 years might be
employed. Another provision of the ei
bill as it came from the house was n
that during the six months' lapse no u]
child under 14 years was to be em- in
ployed in school districts where the w
compulsory attendance feature of the ti
public school had been invoked. The d<
amendment to make the bill of gen- r<
eral application January 1, 1917, was th
offered by Senator Padgett of Colle- e<
ton county, and was accepted by a w
vote of 30 to 1. th
Throughout the coursc of debate, B
numerous amendments were propos- G
ed, these looking to indigent families, J<
?/v+* +V?a oViilrl urge A
or wnere me muui ui u>? u w
necessary for self support. In each
instance these were rejected by large
majorities. ti
Senator Johnson's amendment to bi
exclude children who had to labor c
for self support was rejected by a E
vote of 22 to 16. ni
An amendment by Senator Stacy ^
of Cherokee would have admitted the ]e
employment of children above 12 \\
years when the schools of the district
were not in session. Another proviso i
was that the children of widows be
excluded when their.,labor was necessary
for the support of the family. ja
This was voted down by a vote of 20 n)
to 16. ai
The most radical of all amendments aj
was that proposed by Senator Stuck^ m
ey of Lee county, who would have p<
the wages which indigent children 0j
might earn paid out of the public

vote of 26 to 7. The bill was order- 0j
ed to the house for concurrence in
the amendments, making the date of p,
effectiveness January 1, 1917, and rf
changing the bill tc general applica- er
tion at that time, without the six
months' adjustment period.
The senate accepted the free conference
report on the Carlisle two
quart a month liquor bill by striking
out section 10, which would require p
the labelling of a grip containing one
pint of whiskey. J
Action by the senate in postponing .
debate until tomorrow practically p
killed the two cent rate bill. o1
The bill providing fifteen cents re- ^
muneration for national guard drills, .
the individual not to receive pay for
more than two each month was passed
and sent to the house. j
The bill providing for a board of
conciliation passed the senate tonight yj
and was sent to the house for amend- -yr
. ment adjustment... The bill provides
I for a board of three, one from the
f labor unions, one from the employers ^
and a third to be appointed by tne
governor, upon recommendation by ^
the other two.
WARRING NATIONS SWELL
THEIR NAVAL STRENGTH
V
Washington, Feb. 18.?The British ^
navy today is approximately twice as *
strong as the combined fleets of Ger- ^
many and Austria, while the Teutonic ^
combination has just about double a|
the sea fighting force of the United st
States, acording to information in ^
the possession of the navy depart- ^
ment. The facts were disclosed to the w
house naval committee today by st
Capt. Josiah McKean of the staff of
the chief of operations.
Capt. McKean also said the French
navy was from 15 to 20 per cent,
stronger than the American, according
to latest information. He explained
that these were rough es- bi
timates and that charts showing the n<
specific relations of the various navies E
would be submitted later by Rear is
Admiral JBenson, tne cmei 01 opera- >
tions. a]
So far as is definitely known, the ai
captain told the committee, the Jap- A
anese building programme adopted
several years ago and which will not ?(
be completed for several years to in
come, provides for a modern fleet of
eight dreadnoughts and eight battle
cruisers. It was possible, he added,
that additional building was in ,
progress as all nations but the United
States had building policies.

PREME COURT.
Washington, Feb. 21?The right of
the South Carolina to require the dis- tr
pensary to pay to it any money in tl
their possession due the Carolina G
Glass Company was upheld by the V
supreme court. The court also up- n
held the judgment of the dispensary es
commission against the Glass com- al
pany for $28,419.04. a
When the Glass company made a w
claim for the balance due under it's ri
contract wi:h the directors of the ir
state dispensary to furnish bottles
for the dispensary, the commission ir
named to wind up the dispensary af- is
fairs held that the state owed the it
company $513,013.75, and that by a pi
conspiracy between the company and fi
some of the dispensary board mem- m
bers, the company had charged the se
state at least ten percent too much d:
for bottles. 01

the kompany owed the state $51,- r<

ance due the state of $28,419.24. Af- h
ter this decision on February 23,
1910, the legislature passed a bill
giving the dispensary commission
power to make decisions as to debts ei
due the state. It was directed, where 6
any corporation owed the state,' the B
auditor of any county dispensary in- n
debted to the corporation should pay b
the amount due the corporation to lc

THREE FULLY EQUIPPED DO
MESTIC SCIENCE KITCHENS
IN COUNTY SCHOOLS.
Work carried on now among bot
women and girls.
The Girls Canning Club, which di
so much for the girls of Abbevill
County last year, has grown to sue
an extent that it has taken in th
women also and now all the wor
is known as "Home Demonstratio
Work." This is indeed the nam
that suits the work, for the ain
whether the work be with girls c
women is the study of home making
There are now three organize
Women's Home Demonstration Clubs
one at Sharon, one at Antreville, an
one at Cold Springs. Our Count
Agent hopes to have six of thes
clubs. She meets with them once
month, and they study lessons o
homo decoration, home nursing, car
ning, serving of meals, balanced r*
tions, home sanitation, and man
other subjects of interest to hous
keepers.
There are also three fully equij
ped domestic science kitchens i
tnree 01 our country scnoois, as
result of this work which has bee
begun in the county. These kite!
ens are in the Sharon, Antreville an
Cold Springs schools. The Count
Agent meets with these clubs once
week, and gives lessons in cooking.
Most of the girls who were in th
Canning Club last year are plannin
to work even harder this year as
result of their past success, and ther
will be a number of new clubs oi
ganized. One with six members hs
been organized at Bethia, one s.
Warrenton, and one at Monterey.

ATTENTION TEACHERS
RURAL SCHOOL
A3 county urgamzer 01 tne itun
School Improvement Association,
wish to inform the Teachers of thes
[Schools that I have on hand a limite
[number of splendid school maps c
the United States of America. Thes
maps are well mounted, ready t
hang on the wall and are 8 by 5 fee
in dimension.
Our efficient and wide awake Cor
gressman Wyatt Aiken, has secure
these maps from the Governmen
When I wrote Mr. Aiken requestin
maps for Abbeville Rural School;
his official quota was exhausted; bv
being a resourceful man he borrov
ed these on hand from Senator E. I
Smith.
As soon as the new issue is read:
Mr. Aiken will send our County's pr
rata share.
It is necessary in making my r<
port to Miss Elizabeth Dickson, Pre:
ident of the State School Improv<
menl Association, to know th
amounts raised by each school fc
i n *mi tinnnn T fU lirtva o
I LIIIS puipuoc# X tucicxviv U15^ a
teachers, who by Box parties, play
lectures or entertainments hav
raised money for School Improv*
ments, to report same to me. Th
maps will be awarded in the order i
which these reports come to me an
will be delivered to the successfi
contestants at the monthly meeting
of the County Teachers' Associatio
at the Court House.
If the School Trustees and Patron
have furnished teams and labor i
beautifying grounds, include this i
estimate of money raised and expenc
ed upon school property. Give you
public spirited men credit for everj
thing they do.
I have been deeply pleased an
encouraged to note in our Count
papers the efforts our earnest teacV
ers are making to improve the equip
ment and libraries of our rurs
schools. I have also noticed wit
pleasure and admiration the hel
given our teachers upon these occa
sions by the mothers of the pupils i:
1 1 J--~ nwf p i fli/si
nuiuillg Llieae ciaci lauimtuw lit bilVi
homes, thus accomplishing two nobl
ends?that is entertaining the child
ren and young people of their neigh
borhood, and at the same time im
proving the equipment of thei
schools! These mothers are "build
ing better than they know." Le
the good work continue and let ou
young people enjoy themselves.
In conclusion I feel that I mus
stress the idea of adding constantl;
to our school libraries. The librar;
has been called the "peoples college.1
As a matter of fact, a college coursi
consists of a few of the best book
on certain subjects studied with spe
cial care. Children should get th
habit of reading so that they cai
carry on their education after the;
leave school or college. The adult
in a community need the library a
well as the school children. Ou
State has a library fund from whicl
is given an amount equal to tha
raised by the local school. Thus i
a school raises ten dollars for a libra
ry or addition thereto the Stat
will give ten* dollars also. The sup
plementary readers thus bought ar
a great help to the school childrei
and to the teachers.

. Representative Aiken has made the
following statement on preparedness;
j "Ever since I have been in congress

k I did not so vote was during the last
session of congress, and at that time
I believed it wise to wait and profit
j by the experiences of the European
' war. The late George S. Legare and
I voted always for material increases
"j in the naval strength of the country
and were severely criticised by some
'J of our colleagues who are now for a
big navy.regardless of cost.

a "I want to see the United States
