good corn, to which tho feed man re
plied thnt he did, quoting tho market
price, and tho farmer told him It wns

In about an hour Mr. Farmer drove
up with the corn, which surprised
Mr. Fccdstorcman at tho quick time
made In getting to Maysvlllo with a
big two-horso wngonload of corn over
twelve miles of rough roads In nn

Managers Itiisscll, Dyo nnd Wntklns
of the Washington Opcrn House, have
booked the famous "Mutt & Jeff"
show. The company will appear at
tho opera house on noxt Monday night
in n laughing, rollicking pleco en
titled "Mutt & Jeff In College."
This particular piece, although us
ing for Its locnlo a collogo, does not
ridicule or exaggerate our private edu
cational Institutions. In fact It ex
tolls Its virtues, biit nt tho same time
demonstrates that while thero Is time
for study there is also time for diver
sion and amusement of tho wholesome
nnd Ingratiating kind. "Mutt & Jeff"
are too well known for further com
ment. Their exploits have beon aired
in tho columns of our dallies for years
and thus far they have not ceased to
find favor with tho multitudes. Man
ager Gus Hill has given the present!
production his particular care and at
tention, besides n company of thirty
capable people, including pretty girls,
comedians nnd artists who eau bo ex
pected to entertain nnd who do so to
tho queen's taste. A number of jiov-
eltlea. features and other orlglnnl;
bits will bo introduced. Tho muslo1
has been specially composed for tho!
offering nnd contains fifteen song lilts '
sure to bo whistled before tho on-'
gngement Is half over. Heads of col
leges and those connected with their
various departments, desirous of see
ing tlio play should write to the man-
ngoment. Monday night has been set
aside for tho occasion and a gnla tnn
Is expected.
