WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 Whether
or not England has broken faith is
the newest question brought out by
the dispute over the German decree.
In August, 1914, British Ambassa
dor Spring-Rice wrote Secretary .of
State Bryan that the British foreign
minister, Sir Edward Grey, "gave full
assurances" that British merchant
men would not fire upon German sub
marines unless attacked.
If this pledge has been broken,
there may be a new protest.

The organisation of farmera at Lor
ella and at Bonanza now have over
100 members and much effective work1
is expected. An effort will be started,
soon to have a similar club organ

be spread throughout the couatra
