ON BLACKMAIL LEADER'S TRAIL
SEE WHAT IS
COMING NEXT
Now that "The Rose Garden Husband" is
well on its way, we want to tell you about next
week's novel that will appear in The Times.
It is "The Red Emerald," by John Reed Scott.
It is a delightful compound of mystery .and
romance. %
It deals with dukes, duchesses, love, hidden
treasure, diplomacy and beautiful women, but,
in the beginning at least, chiefly with Orme Ven
dome and Mrs. Tremaine.
The latter is a divorcee, charming and sought
after. Even her former husband dii»es with her
and enjoys the adventure.
She meets the new Spanish ambassador.
The story discloses royal blood, a haffling rec
ollection of a former meeting—and a mysterious
emerald.
Wouldn't it be peculiar to find that this wom
an, whose ancestry seems to be more less ob
scure, should turn out to be the princess, or
something?
Bead it and see.
Tt starts Monday in Tho Times and will be
finished in just SIX big installments.

FINE FOR
FLOURING
MILLS, EH?
Producing Ifgures which he
had obtained in the light de
partment, Mayor Fawcett today
showed that under the new com
mercial light rate ordinance,
passed last month, the Tacoma
Grain Co. had been given a re
duction in its light bill from
$71.50 In December to $9.55 In
January.
The new ordinance pro
vdles that all factories in Tacoma
using 25 horsepower or more of
power may have the privilege of
receiving city light at the same
rate that It pays for power. The
grain company buys power from
the T. R. A P. Co. at 6-lOths
cent a kilowatt, and under the
ordinance wag privileged to de
mand the aame rate from the
city.
Electric Supt. Collins, called
to the council chamber, admitted
that the reduction had been
made.
"But light bills have been re
duced ln only three factories," he
declared. "They are the Taco
ma Grain Co., Sperry Mills and
Tacoma Flouring Mills Co. No
other concerns have been affect
ed.
"On the other hand, by means
ef this new rate, we are getting
a large amount of new business,
and encouraging new manufac
turing plants to come to Tacoma.
"Although I admit that It has
caused a peculiar reduction In
three instances, I can show al
ready that we have gained
enough new business to more
than balance tbia loss, and we
will continue to get more every
month."
