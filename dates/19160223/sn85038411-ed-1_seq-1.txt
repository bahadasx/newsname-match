PAINTED GIRL "FLIRTS"
Session Resumed This After
noon —Savoy Testimony
Is All In
With the re-convening at 1 o'clock j
this afternoon of Dauphin county li
' cense sessions, the court heard further
illuminating tales of the midnight
supper parties in the Columbus Hotel, j
The hearing on the remonstrance
against the Columbus, the fourth in
the series of a twenty or more sched
uled against as many applicants for re
license, was begun lute yesterday aft
ernoon after the close of the hearing j
on the Hotel Sa\"oy application.
K. H. Dodge, the first witness in j
the campaign inaugurated by llie
churches of the city and the Dauphin
County Law and Order and No-License
Leagues was the first witness. He re
sumed the stand again this afternoon, i
John P. Guyer, the field secretary of 1
the Law and Order League, followed.
If the tales of the pink-glowing
cabaret of the Savoy made a crowded
courtroom sit and take notice, the
"doings" as one witness put it, at the
Columbus were hardly less startling.
The Barristers Uneasy?
The witnesses told of the gather
ings of painted girls at the tables, of
the open flirting from table to table,
of the drinking of persons far past
the intoxication stage, while one tale
of a member of the Dauphin county
bar who joyously flirted with a pretty
girl at a nearby table caused some
audible sniekerirtg and neck-craning
about the bar enclosure.
President Judge Kunkel and Addi
tional Law Judge AlcCarrell agreed to
a continuance of the hearing until l
o'clock this afternoon at the sugges
tion of At tornov D. 8. Heitz, counsel
for Maurice K. Russ, the proprietor
of the Columbus. Mr. Seitz said he
could expedite matters considerably
by corraling some witnesses although

Philadelphia. Keb. U". Following
tlie lead of Chief Davis, of the water
bureau, who on Monday ordered the
1.500 employes of that bureau to lib
strain from intoxicants during work
ing hours, under pain of instant dis
missal fo>- violating the rule, James P.
McLaughlin, chief of the electrical
bureau, to-day issued a similar orjler
to the 1.000 tnen in his department.
Director Wilson, of the Department of
Public Safety, also announced that ,
policemen, firemen and other em- j
ployes of his department to the num
ber of 10.000 will receive notice of the
"temperance during working hours"
decree.
The principal factor in the new at
titude of hostility to'the use of alco
holic liquors is the workmen's com
pensation law. which recently became
effective in Pennsylvania.
Attack by Wister Replied
to by Towne in Verse
Special lo I lie Telegraph
I Washington. Feb. 23. Charles A.
Towne. former Senator from Minnesota
and former Congressman from New
York, wrote th* following rejoinder
yesterday to the verses assailing the
President given out in Philadelphia by
Owen Wister, the author:
To Owen Wister—A Riposte
Alas! that one skilled In words that
blister
Should find himself In mood so fierce
and ireful
As he should yearn to be ,i verbal
twister.
In such a cause to seek the phrase
most direful.
Now, certe, this cannot be that Owen
Wister
Who lately in a book that ruled the
hour.
Did portray how Get-mania's fate had
missed
Through base abuse of Hohenzollern
oower!
That he should now rail at our Presi
dent.
Bewailing lack of stronger words the
• while.
Suggests a foretime Wister precedent.
And makes lis, when he blusters
smile.

Turks Evaeuatc Another City
Ahead of Pursuing Russ;
Lose Many Prisoners
j The Germans in a great offensive
are driving for tlie French fortress oT
I Verdun and already have succeeded in
i penetrating two miles into the French
lines in the Woevre region,
j The drive resulting in this advance
■ was along a ten-mile front. It had |
its impulse almost directly to the north
|of Verdun, where the Germans suc
cessively occupied the Haumont wood
'and then the village itself bringing
jthein within eight miles of the Fort
ress. Fighting of great violence is
( continuing.
' The present German offensive has
been in progress more than three
weeks. It has resulted in important
net sains, for while at some points tlio
allies were able to regain parts of the
ground lost the Germans have clung
tenaciously to many positions despite
| all efforts to dislodge them.
Petrograd announces the continued
pursuit of the remnants of the Turkish
I army which fled from Erzerum with
the taking of the Turkish stronghold
by the Russians. Newspaper dis
patches report the Turks evacuating
Trebizond, on the Black Sea coast, to
wards which city, however, another
body of Turks from Erzerutn is said
to be retreating. The Russians are;
making an effort to cut off this force. I
The German offensive on the west- j
em front is again Commanding atten-!
tion, its renewed outbreak having re
sulted in what looks to be important
breaches in the French lines in the
Artois, while efforts to push hack the
French lines near Verdun also had
some measure of success.
There is increasing activity along
the front in Russia,- but the opera
tions for the most part are confined
to artillery battles and outpost en
gagements.
