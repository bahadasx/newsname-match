German Troops, Under the
Leadership of the Crown
Prince, Gain Important Vic
lory Over Allies in West
(By United Press Leased Wire.)
London, Feb. 23. The German
orown prince, dealing the greatest
smash on the western front alnce
breaking the English Ypres Unes laat
May, baa taken nearly six and one
half miles of French trenches near
Verdun, the Berlin war office claim
ed today.
Thla extensive offensive was aimed
agalnat the outer defenses of the im
portant fortifications of the town of
Verdun in the neighborhood of Con-
xenroye and Azannee, about 10 miles
to the .north.
There the Germans not only claim-,
ed their enormous gain of ground,
but they announced they had taken
3,000 prisoners and much booty.
Following up thia reputed victory,
they claimed that In another often'
aire move they had captured 700
yards of French trenches east of
Reldelwelle rln Alsace and 80 pris
oners. '
How terrible was the German drive
was evidenced from the Paris ad
mission that there had been a great
offensive around Verdun, and that
the Germans had been killed off by
'battalions. Paris claimed that while
the Haumont wood had been evacu
ated, the French had regained the
Caures wood, from which they had
been evicted yesterday. Breaking of
the French salient north of Beau
mont and 10 miles northeast of Ver
dun was admitted. Recapture of
some trenches around Souchex was
claimed by Paris.
No attack of similar strength has;
been delivered on either elde in the
western combat for months, except
ing the French offensive in the
Champagne In September.
The battle Is still raglug about 10
miles from Verdun on the east bank
of the Mouse, with the crown prince
nlmlnir in fnrm hta irmv annthwnrri
in the hope of conquering all the
outer defenses of Verdun and then
bringing up his 42 centimeter guns
to level the forts.
Such a move would. give the Ger -
mans a great advantage in the south,
as the French have threatened their
communications by retaining the
Verdun stronghold.

Washington, Feb. 23. The help-
lcssnoss of the Pacific coast, due to
Inability of a fleot to pass through
the slide-blocked Panama canal, was
disclosed to the house naval com-
: mltteo today by Congressman Ste
phens.
He charged that the navy discrim
inated against the west coast, leav
ing only an obsolete battleship, a
dozen cruisers of the third class and
a few submarines to guard it against
possible danger.
Creation of a second fleet, suffi
ciently strong to control the Pacific,
was counselled by Admiral Badger
of the general navy board.
"I favor another fleet large enough
to dominate the Pacific, and superior
to the fleet of any possible oppon
ent," he said. "We must have two
fleets to adequately defend both
coasts. It has been the policy of the
general board to keep the fleet In the

As for the Panama canal situation,

Congressman Brltton Interposed
with the question, "Was the general
board advised a year ago of strained
relations with Japan so It could
properly place the fleet?" .
"I do not know, as I was not a

If another fleet were to be con

In this connection, he declared
that the Mare Island yard could not

swings only about three feet above
the surface of the stream, and is
anchored by cables to keep it from
being washed away in higher water.
