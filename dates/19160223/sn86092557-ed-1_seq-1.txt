INTERCHANGE OF
FREIGHT IN CITY
Representatives of Three
Railroads Have Thrash
ed It Out.
SEC.C.W.EVANS I0TIFIEB
Will Not Be Necessary To
Do Any New Track
Laying.
In a letter received this morning
from Third Vice President A. W.
Thompson of the Baltimore and Ohio
railroad to Secretary of the Fairmont
Chamber of Commerce Charles W.
Evans, explanations concerning the
proposed Interchange of freight at
Fairmont were made.
The letter stated that Mr. Thomp
son and First Vice President G. W.
Kandolpli of tile Baltimore and Ohio
railroad and. Colonel J. M. Schoon
niaker of the Monongahela railway,
after a series of conferences had de
cided to settle the matter of making
a freight Interchange of Fairmont
without having the matter come beore
the West Virginia Public Service com.
mission.
Several shippers along the Monon
gahela railroad have made complaints
to the Public Servlco commission that
freight which Is destined for Fairmont
and shipped by the Monongaihela, has
to go to Leclirono, Pa., before it can
be transferred to the Baltimore and
Ohio lines and also that freight ship
ped on the B. & O. destined for Monon
gahela railway delivery at Fairmont
must first go to the same point.
Leckrorie 1b the interchange point
on -the old tariff and a .change in this
tariff has beon" requested- by tho bus
iness men of West VlrgfiilL, The mat
ter was to hare been 'taken/before the
Public Service commission February
15 but was postponed.
In the meantime tho officials ot
the roads entering Fairmont got to
gether and have been since working
on details after which Fairmont will
likely be added to the IlBt of connect
ing points botween the'Pennsylvania
and Baltimoro and Ohio railroads and
between the New York Central and
the Baltimore and Ohio. It will not
be absolutely necessary for either
road to do any track building in or
der that they transfer carload ship
ments to each other. Both roads are
connected at Morgan mine near Rives
ville.
The Baltimore and Ohio railroad
when the Monongahela was being
built, tore up it's connection with that
line at OwanB1 Bottling workB. It
was the opinion In railroad circles
that this connection will be rebuilt in
order to facilitate the movement of
freight in and out of the yards. The
connection at Morgan mine will very
likely be retained but the question
of making another at Owens' Bottling
works is still before the companies.
It is the railroad companies' in
structions to their agents that freight
which Is to be transferred to another
railroad must go to the nearest con
necting point, a list of these points
being printed and kept in the Ble of
the agent. The list at present In the
offices of the agents of the Mononga
hela and the Baltimore and Ohio rail
road has been unchanged since the
Inauguration of service on the Monon
gahela to Fairmont. The tariff at
present shows that all freight for Fair
mont which is shipped from the sta
tions along the Monongahela must go
to Leckrone, Pa., where It Is transfer
red to the Baltimore and Ohio. Freight
shipments which originate In Morgan
town and are shipped on the Monon
gahela railroad with instructions to
deliver It at the Baltimore and Ohio
freight unloading platform have to be
sent to Leckrone to be transferred to
the B. & O. there and back hauled to
Fairmont thereby causing the shipper
two days' delay to the shipment The
same la also true of shipments from
the B. & O. points along the river.
