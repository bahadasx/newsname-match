O I A
MRS. INGER JACOBSON.
Mrs. Inger Jacobson, aged-widow
and pioneer woman of Green Lake
township, passed away from the
scenes of this life at the home of her
son, Iver Jacobson, last Saturday, Feb.
19. The cause of death was apoplexy.
She suffered a stroke two years ago,
but seemed to have fully recovered,
when this1 sudden and fatal attack
came.
The deceased was born on the island
Mostero, Stavanger, Norway, Dec. 3,
1833, and hence attained the age of 82
years, two months, and fifteen days.
She came with her family to this
country in 1871, and located on a
homestead in Green Lake township,
where she experienced all the trials
and hardships of the early pioneers
Her husband, Knut Jacobson, died
twenty-seven years ago, Feb. 10, and
she has since made her home with
her son, Iver. She has five surviving
children who with their respective
families mourn her death: Iver Jacob
son, Spicer, Minn. Mrs. John. Sogge,
Trail City, S. Rev. T. K. Jacobs,
Tuttle, N. D. Mrs. Lena Hanson, Spic
er, Minn and Dr. Jno. C. Jacobs of
Willmar. She is also mourned by a
brother, John Hodenfield in Iowa and
one sister, Mrs. J. O. Kloster, of Spic
er besides many other relatives and
friends.
The funeral occurs tomorrow
(Thursday), and interment takes place
in the Green Lake church cemetery
by the grave of her husband.
IDA E. GREENFIELD.
Ida Elvine Greenfield, foster daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. B. J. Greenfield,
died at her home at 516 Fifth street
at ten o'clock Sunday morning, Feb.
20th.
She has been in poor health for
about four years. Three weeks ago,
she had an attack of influenza and fail
ed gradually. She sat up until a few
moments before her death, which
came peacefully and quiet. She asked
her dear Redeemer for help and aid
until her voice faltered. And we
heard her whisper "Dea-r Je-sus he-lp
me." She was conscious until the last
moment.
She was born in St. Johns, August
10, 1900, and attended school in the
Central group of buildings. She was
at her death, 15 years, 6 months and
10 days of age.
The funeral takes place this after
noon from the Lutheran Free church,
Rev Michaelson officiating.
In the vineyard, a tender rose was
blooming
It was planted there by God's own
hand
The ground was cold and dreary, hut
God replanted it in Paradise,
And now she is blooming to his honor.

$35 For Two Wyandottes.
Gilbert Ericson sold two White
Wyandottes, a cockerel and pullet,
which he has raised to J. A. Adams at
Minneapolis at a price of $35. The
cockerel took second prize at the Will
mar show. Mr. Ericson will ship the
birds tomorrow. He paid this amount
for a cock and six hens two years ago,
and the sale noted shows that he made
no mistake in buying the best strain
he could get. There is a big demand
for eggs and birds, he says. The
above sale was a result of the show
ing made at the Willmar show.
A Big Toll of Babies.
The child welfare subject has been
given investigation by the Public
Health Association of the State. It
has figured out that last year 75 in
fants up to the age of five years died
for each 1,000 born or 24 per cent of
all deaths reported.
The record for Kandiyohi was a
trifle above the state average, or 79
per 1,000, and 25 per cent of all
deaths.
Pastor Receives Call.
Rev. M. B. Michaelson of the Luth
eran Free church has received a call
to Marinette, Wis. Rev. Nordberg,
formerly of New London, but late of
Marinette, has accepted a call to the
Pillsburg church at Minneapolis. Rev.
Michaelson has served the local
church during the past ten years and
has made a large circle of friends who
are hoping that he will see his way
clear to remain.
Entertain at Dinner.
Last Monday evening the salesmen
at the Willmar Co-operative store were
entertained at a seven o'clock dinner
at the J. G. Monson home, three miles
east of the city. Following the din
ner, the remainder of the evening was
spent in music and cards.

Progressive Leap Year Party.
The Misses Winzie Dahleen, Vera
Boom and Florence Erickson enter
tained about thirty friends last Mon
day evening at a progressive leap year
party. The guests met at the Dahleen
home, where each were given three
sheets of colored paper, and told to
make chains. Oscar Person and Min
nie Peterson won the honors. The
salad course was served, after which
the Boom residence was visited. Here
several musical numbers and guessing
contests furnished the amusement.
Miss Vera Swenson won first honors.
Coffee and cake were served before
the guests took their departure for the
Erickson home. A "modeling con
test," with each one endeavoring to
model a pig out of chewing gum, fur
nished a g^eat deal of fun, J. F. .Ny
quist winning first prize, and Sig Nel
son the consolation prize. Ice cream,
wafers and cake were served. Fol
lowing the refreshments games were
played for a short time.
Too Long Delayed.
A strong anti-democratic influence
was eliminated from President Wil
son's cabinet when Secretary of War
Lindley M. Garrison resigned. A a
militarist and imperialist his proper
affiliation is with ex-President Roose
velt. It is unfortunate that his resig
nation was so long delayed, and still
more so that he was appointed at all.
Though he failed to lead the adminis
tration as far from democratic prin
ciples as he wished, he did succeed in
leading it much further than it should
have gone, and to his influence 's
largely attributable the recent reac
tionary trend which has marred Presi
dent Wilson's fine record. Now, that
this malign influence has gone, there
is cause to hope that the Administra
tion may again turn toward democ
racy.—The Public.
