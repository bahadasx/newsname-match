So read a telegram from St. Louis
that was handed to a Missourian re
porter by the editor this morning
"Find this girl," said the editor. "Be
careful; it looks like priss agent
stuff."
The reporter took the telegram and
began his search. First he made the
round of the hotels, but the registers
had jio Elsie Pierpont. One hotel clerk
said that an Elsie Pierpont stajed at
the hotel last week. Was the reporter
to miss a good news story, even if It
was press agent publicity?
He went to the Walnut Street Thea
ter, where the girl was though,t to be
pla) ing. The owner did not know the
names of the chorus, but directed him
to 1100 Walnut street, where the chor
us girls were sta)ing.
"Yes, Miss Pierpont is staying here,"
.said the landlady. "But she is sleep
ing, for the girls work late at night."
The reporter read the telegram to
her.
Bang she hit the door of the room
in which Elsie Pierpont slept.
"Get up, .Miss Pierpont! Get up, Miss
Pierpont! a reporter has good news
for jou," cried the landlady.
Soon there emerged from the room
a dark-haired, sparkling-ejed joung
person, wearing a varicolored kimono.
She did not look like a chorus girl.
She had more the appearance of a
school girl.
The reporter read the telegram to
her.
"Oh,! What a surprise! Yea, 1
have an uncle fighting in France. Oh!
This is sure news to me. Where is
the manager? Call him quick!"
This is the story she told:
"My home is in Xew York. I alwajs
loved the stage. When I had spare
time, I posed for my uncle. Gene Di
manche, to whom the telegram refers.
He was quite a sketcher from life. He
liked me for this, and always said that
he would pay me back In full some
