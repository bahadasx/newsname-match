CANADIAN HORSE
BUYER IN CITY
FOR GOVERNMENT
Dr. R. E. Fisher of Bull Moose Bat
talion at Fort Francis
Here.
TO SHIP TWENTY-TWO WRATi
OF HORSES TO THE BORDER
Does Not Buy From Corporations But
Buys Direct From
Owners.
Dr. R. E. Fisher, sergeant of the
Bull Moose battalion of Fort Francis,
Ont., Canada, is in the city buying
horses for the Canadian army. His
contract calls for 22 head of horses
to be shipped on the M. & I. rail
way to International Falls and across
the border.
"We have specific orders from the
Canadian government not to 'buy
from corporations nor to purchase
horses from anyone except from the
owners," said Dr. Fisher to a rep
resentative of the Pioneer today.
"This order," added Dr. Fisher, "has
been given to prevent the United
States from regarding us as inter
fering with the United States neut
rality.
"As to the claim that the Cana
dian government is trying to recruit
men from the United States, there
can be no truth in at all,' said
Dr. Fisher. "I have known two men
in the recruiting business who re
ceived a prompt dishonorable dis
charge for even attempting to do a
thing like that. The fact of the mat
ter is that we do not need to."
Dr. Fisher explained that the
horses he has been ordered to buy
must weigh between },100 and 1,300
pounds. No grey or white horses
will be accepted on account of mak
ing easy targets. Although only 22
are now needed, preparations are be
ing made to buy 80 Ihorses in the
spring.
Dr. Fisher stated this morning that
he believed that none of the horses
that he is now buying will ever see
the war front.
Men in Canada are at present en
listed for only one year," said Dr.
Fisher, "which goes tj^shaw that the
war will not, if the Canadian view
point is right, continue over twelve
months more."

INDIAN TREATY TEST
IS ATTACKED DY U. S.
That the government will not per
mit an attack of the Indian liquor
treaty without a fight was indicated
in the United States district court at
Minneapolis several days ago when
the court gave permission to the gov
ernment to intervene in a suit
brought to test the validity of the
treaties.
The suit was brought by the John
Gund Brewing company of La Crosse,
Wis., and was directed against the
Great Northern Railway company,
which has refused liquor shipments
into Indian treaty territories. F. W.
Zollman, representing the John Gund
Brewing company, explained that the
suit was brought principally for the
purpose of establishing the rights of
residents to order beer for their own
personal use and have it shipped to
them. He admitted that he was
questioning the right of the treaty
to deprive residents of their personal
rights.
