SECOND DAY OF
THE MOTOR SHOW
IS BIG SUCCESS
Banken and Kiddies Are Both Hon
ored on the Same Day at the
Eleventh Annual Omaha
Motor Exposition.
OUT-OF-TOWN DEALERS ATTEND
Already Oyer 1,000 Territory Deal-en-Have
Arrived and Total for
Week Expected to Be 3,000.
TODAY 13 THE FARMERS' DAY
The second day of the eleventh
annual Omaha motor exposition
found the big municipal Auditorium
crowded from morning until night
wUh an attendance that considera
bly exceeded that of the opening
aay.- Washington day permitted a
holiday or a shorter working day for
many Omahans and they topk ad
vantage of this to attend the show.
It wag Bankers' and Kiddies' day
In one yesterday. Admission to the
little folk was reduced to 15 cents
yesterday afternoon and they took
advantage of the offer in great num
bers. The boys and girls seemed to
take just as much interest in the ex
hibits as did the grown-ups and many
of them could talk much more intel
ligently of the specifications and de
signs of the cars than their elders.
Th salesmen In the various booths en
tered Into the spirit of the occasion and
answered the questions of the curious
lads and lassies with the same courtesy
they would a man or woman In the mar
ket for a car.
Oat-of-Toirn Dealer Arrive.
One of the most gratifying features of
the show to the agents la the large num
ber of out-of-town dealers who are com
ing In. Last year 1,800 out-of-town deal
ers visited the show, but this week bids
well to shnttef that record asunder. Al
ready over 1.000 dcalera have come In
from tut-of-town. Every train brings
many more In, and before the week Is
over it la confidently expected that the
total number will exceed S.OOO.
And these out-of-town men are buying
cars. Every single one of them has
prosperity for his motto and believes
that 1914 Is going to be a banner year
In this territory. Aa a result they are
putting In large advance orders. Many
are buying whole tralnloads of machines
for Immediate delivery. Trade territory
tributary to Omaha Is not going to sutler
any hard times this year, and the auto
- men know this. They know business U
,-hoIhk to-bo-aotter than ever -veforr-and
they are preparing for It.
But dealers are not the .only owt-of-
town 'men who are visiting the show -in
largo "numbVrs. Farmers and chaps from
the mailer towns near by are coming In
by the score. The fame of the Omaha
show haa spread far and wide and the
men who are figuring on the purchase of
a machine are taking this opportunity to
see all the cars at one time In the same
place so they can make their comparl
sons. .
Today Farmers Day.
. Today is Farmers' day at the show and
it Is anticipated that hundreds will bo on

has been honored with a day at an auto-

AMERICA PLANS A
BIGGER NAYY THAN
THAT OFOERHANY
Object of Building Policy of United
States Formulated in 1903 to
Surpass Teuton Power
on Sea.
THIS NOT SUFFICIENT NOW
Present Program is to Hate Fleet
Equal to Greatest Within
Ten Years.
ADMIRAL BADGER IS WITNESS
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22. The
object of the building policy for
mulated in 1903 by the navy gen
eial board, it was disclosed today
before the house naval committee,
v as to keep the United States ahead
cf Germany In the race for naval
supremacy. The statement was
made by Hear Admiral Charles J.
Badger, a member of the general
board, who explained that the policy
bad contemplated a fleet of forty
eight first line battleships by 1919
t" accomplish its purpose.
The statement did not go into the
record of the hearing and Admiral
Badger did not amplify it to show
why the board had thought such a
course necessary. The admiral was
replying to a suggestion that the
object of the old policy, abandoned
this year by the board for the first
time, was to keep the American navy
In second place. While that was
the effect It had, he said, the real
object was to keep ahead of Ger-
nmny.
Cbaove of Poller.
This year the board fixed as Its poller
the creation by 1925 of a fleet eaual to
the most powerful afloat at that time.
The committee did not go Into the board a
reasons for changing: Its Ideas hevnn
drawing out the explsnatlon that the
board believed that a Poet 1 per cent
superior to any fighting force that mlaht
be brought against It would be necessary
to insure against the invasion of Ameri
can soil by an enemy.
Under oiestlonlng by Representative
Kelley. Admirsl Badger said the con
struction of three additional riread-
naughta and eight battle, cruisers would
Piace me navy on a par with the capital
snips or the German fleet today. Ger
many now has twenty-two dreadnaughts
and eight battle cruisers, he said, ac
cording to the best available Information.
while the United States has all told nine
teen ships ft the dreadnauht alss.'
oeMri-Oreat Brltalrrsprobable TTeet
within two years. Admiral Badger said
the United States would be obliged to
have a total force of forty, dreadnaughts,
rirteen battle cruisers, twenty-flve ewlft
scouting craft, 500 submarines and de
stroyers. . He was' not favoring such a
program, but merely answering questions
by Representative Butler. Such a fleet
could not be built In two years, he added,
though it might be constructed In four.
Jast Wot HI Enoagh.
In urging a great increase In the fleet
Admiral Badger said he did not wish to
be understood as saying the present force
fwas not a thoroughly efficient one.
T" did not want to ' give the Impres
sion," he added, "that our fleet is no
good. The only trouble with It Is that
It Is not big enough for possibilities. It's
a good fleet, well drilled, well equipped
and well organised. Wo are now pre
pared Just as far as our power will per
mit us to be. More power means more
ships."
Regarding the present piece o: the
United States fleet among the navlos of
the world Admiral Badger said he classed
It as third in fighting power, w!th France
a close fourth.
"I think we are No. i," he aaid. "Japan
Is coming along, but has a good deal to
do to equal Our fleet In military power
fighting efficiency I think we are a
pretty good third, with Franc not far
behind."
