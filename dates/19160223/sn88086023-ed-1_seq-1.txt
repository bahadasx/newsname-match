COMES TO Tl
High Administration Authority For
casts That Wilson Will Appear Be
fore Congress Within a Week to
Announce a Desire to Break
Diplomatic Relations Because of
Apparent Unwillingness of Ger
man Government to Settle the
Lusitania Controversy.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23. A high
administration authority forecast I
Wilson's appearance before congrem
within a week to announce a desire t
break diplomatic relations with Ger
many This action is certain to re
sult if German intimations are correct
that Von Jagow has instructed Bern
storff to play for further delay In a
settlement of the Lusltanta case, for
a long discussion of technicalities ovtr
the German proclamation of warfarn
Relations between Germany and
America depend entirely upon Bern
torff's instructii.ns. due here in two
days. Wilson is determined not to
permit parleying. If Germany en
deavors to cause another compllca
t on. the president is prepared to
place the whole affair in the hand
of congress.
Administration officials took a
gloomy view of the situation It was
suggested that publicity of the gov
ernment's views might prevent
break. Should Wilson decide to take
the question of a rupture before con
gress there is still time for Germany
to correct her pol'cy.
Officials declared the president is
I done with parleying. The alreadv
i vigorous activities have caused a col
, lapse of the agitation for an issuance,
of a warning for Americans to keep
off armed merchantmen. Those fos
i tering the plan have not changed
; their idea but de not desire to press
ithe resolution s nee they understand
i the White House would not support
: them.
Gore announced today he wili bV
