OYSTKR HA V. May .'7. Hundreds
of persons came here today in three
special trains from New York and
inarched from the railroad station to
Sagamore Mill in columns four
abreast to pay their respects to I'olo
nel Theodore RooRevelt and assure
him of their support in the event of
his nomination for .the 'presidency.
The marchers, headed by the Seventh
Regiment hand song "The Army and
Nnvy Forever" and other popular airs.
Itichard H. Hurd. who was spokes
man for the visitors, in addressing
'olonel Roosevelt, said:
"Lincoln said this nation could not
endure half jdave and half free. It is
equally true, as you have pointed out.
I hat this nation cannot now endure
half hyphenated and half American."
t'olonel Roosevelt, addressing the
isitors from the porch of his home,
said in part:
"We have a right to demand of
even' man who comes here and be
comes a citizen, that he becomes an
American and nothing else. We re
gard the hyphen as a bar sinister
drawn across our national mat of
arms and we don't Intend to permit it
to remain there. To you. Isith native
of this country and those born abroad,
and above till, to you ohj- natives.
Americans of old stock, you cannot
expect to get loyalty from the immi
grant or the immigrant's children un
less you make this a country to which
a proud man can be loyal. And to do
that you have gut to demand that the
country stand for courage and for
strength. No man ever yet was loyal
to a coward. No man ever yet was
loyal to a weakling whose weakness
was due to the fact that he would not
take the pains and undertake the

"Just today I was very glad to see
published in the papers a letter of
Admiral Dewey describing an Incident
that took place while I was president.
Wh'-n we were menaced with trouble.
I acted upon the theory that the
proper way of handling international
relations was by speaking softly and
carrying a big stick. And in that
particular case Dewey mi the Amer
ican navy represented the big stick.
I asked on behalf of the nation for
nothing to which we were not justly
entitled. I was as courteous as pos
sible; 1 not only acted with justice,
but with courtesy toward them. I
put every battleship and every torpedo
boat on the sea under the American
flag and Dewey, with instructions to
hold himself ready and in entire pre
liaredness to sail at a moment's no

war. Dewey was the greatest possible
provocation of peace.
"We will do well to remember one
of Lowell's lines: '
