President's Utterances at Ban
quet Considered "Feeler"
to Warring Powers.
NO CONCERN IN TERMS
Prime Interest of U. S. to End
Hostilities and Avoid Repe
tition of Conflict.
"FREEDON OF SEAS" AN ISSUE
Would Want Association Created to
"Prevent Any War Begun Con
trary to Treaty Covenants."
President Wilson, in a speech last
night before the League to Enforce
Peace, outlined in general terms the
basis upon which the United States
would undertake to suggest or initi
ate a movement for peace In Europe.
Coming from the man to whom the
entire world has begun to turn to for
the first definite step in the interest
of peace, the President's address made
a profound impression on his audi
ence.
Although the Chief Executive did
not express a willingness at this time
to renew his offers of mediation to
the powers at war. his address was
generally believed to have been pre
pared with a view to its effect in
European capitals. In many quarters
here it was regarded as an open
"feeler."
lays Down V. S. Policy.
The most important part of the ad
dress appeared in the closing paral
graphs. Amid an intense interest of
the part of his hearers, the President
laid down the course which. he de
clared, he believed the people of the
United States would want their gov
ernment to follow.
In the frst place. he declared, the
United States would have no concern
in the terms which the belligerents
might agree upon for a settlement of
their immediate interests. Having no
part itself in the war, the President
stated. the United States had no ma
terial alms to satisfy. The pritr- in
terest of the United States, he met
forth, was merely in peace and its
guarantees for the future.
"Flreedom of Seas" V;en,
In the second place. the Preident said.
with what was regarded by his a "ence
as a direct reference to the eontroArsies
which have developed bet~ween this coun
try and the belli-erents in connection
with the submarine and blockade issues,
the Ur ited States would want to soe
created a unversal association among
the nations of the wor:d to keep inviolate

Furthermore. he declared. the United
States would want to see such an asso
