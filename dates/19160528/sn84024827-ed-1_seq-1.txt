CHIHUAHUA CITY. Mex.. May 27.
Strong constitutionalist columns
have been despatched by General Ja
cinto Trevino, military commander
of northern Mexico to surround Haci
enda Miembra about 125 miles from
Jiminez. where General Ignacio Ra
mos recently reported Villa, with, a
tew followers, to be hiding. The troop
movement today announced was said'
to be in response to additional and .
confirmatory reports. Military au
thorities here seem confindent that
the bandit chieftain would be cap
tured either dead or alive, within a
few days.
Flying columns are also being- pre
pared to pursue the Villista bandits
between the American field bases and
on the flanks of the American expe
ditionary column. It is 'hoped that
the flying comands will prove so ef
fective that there will be no work for
the American troops to do and that
in the light of their resultant inac
tivity pronip retirement will be re
cognized as the logical necessity.

WASHINGTON, May 27. Pre
' ident Wilson said tonight before
the League to Enforce Peace, that
the United States was ready to
j6in in any feasible association of '
nations to preserve the peace of
the world apainst "political ambi
tion and Selfish hostility" and in
behalf of a "common justice and
common peace." He expressed
the hope that the terms of peace
which end the present war would
include such an arrangement.
Outlining suggestions for peace
.which the President said he hoped
the United States would ma We it -
posible, he included provision
for absolute freedom of the seas,
a contention which has been the
keystone of all the diplomatic dis
sussion with Germany and Great
Britain and virtually guarantees
of territorial integrity and political
Independence. Officials interpret
ed the address a a preliminary
feeler for peace in Europe. He
outlined the conditions on which
the United States would move if
it made a formal mediatory offer
with the idea, it was understood
of learning how his suggestion
would be received abroad.
