lie expressed the hope that the
terms of peace, which will end the
present war would include such an
arrangement.
Outlining suggestions for peace,
which the President said he hoped the
United States would make if it has
the opportunity to do so, he included
provisions for the absolute, freedom
of the seas," a contention which has
been the keystone of all the diplomatic
discussion with Germany and Great
Britain and virtual guarantees of ter­
ritorial integrity and political inde­
pendence.
"I am sure," said the President,
"that the people of the United States
would wish their government to move
along these lines:
Nothing for ourselves.
"First, such a seetlement with regard
to their 'own immediate interest ap'
the belligerents may agree upon. We
have nothins material of any kind tc
ask. for ourselves, and are quite, aware
that we are in no sense or degrees
parties to the present quarrel. Our
interest Is only in peace and its fu­

"First, that every people has aright
to choose the sovereignty under -which
they shall live. Like other nations,"
the President said, "we have, our­
selves no doubt, once and again of­
fended asainrt that principle when for
a little while controlled by selfish pas­
sion, as our franker historians have
been honorable enough to admit, but
It has become mpre and more our rule
of life and action.
"Second, that the small states of
the world have a right tp enjoy the
same respect for their sovereignty and
for their territorial integrity that
great and powerful naions expect and
insist upon.
"And thlra, (that the world has a
right to be free from every disturb­
ance of its peace that has as it origin
an aggression a$d disregard of the
rights of the peoples and nations."
Wholesome Diplomacy.
The outstanding lesson of the war,
the President said, has been that the
peace of the w$hd must henceforth
depend upon a,new, aqd more whole­
some diplomacy.® "If this war has ac
complished nothing for the benefit o!
the world," saidAe, "it has at least
disclosed a great knoral necessity, and
set forward the thinkidg of the states
men of the world by a whole age. Re­
peated uterances of the leading state­
ments of the most of the great nations,
now engaged in war, have made
plain thai their thought has come to
this, that the principle of public right
must henceforth take precedence over
the individual interests of particular
nations, and that the nations of the
World must in some way band them
Helves together and see that that right
prevailf against any sort of selfish
aggression that henceforth alliance
must not be set up against alliance,
but that there must be common agree­
ment for a common object, and that
at the heart of that common object
mutft lie the inviolable right of peo­
ples and of mankind.

"So sincerely do we believe in these

ion, "that I am sure that 1 speak the

ica when I say that the United States
is willing to become a partner in any
feasible association of nations formed
in order to realise these objects and
make them secure against violations."
The President told his hearers
not come to discuss a program,
but only to avow a creed and give
expressions to the confidence that the
world was appnwehing a day when
some common force wOuld( be created
for "the service of a common order,

Another violation of the Mann
White Slave law..has been brought tc

yesterday by wire that wto Norjjli Da­
kota people have been arrested ite one
of the principle cities in the state of
Florida on a charge of violation of
this law.
In an interview with a representa­
tive of The Tribune last evening At­

case will develop ipto one of interest

vulge any unnecessary information in

The man implicated in the case is

LIKLIHOOD THAT
OIL IS PRESENT
Dr. A. G. Leonard Makes Special
Investigation of Situation
for State.
Many reports 'have been received
recently at Governor' Hanna's oflice
relative to both oil and gas which
hav6 been located at and in the vicin­
ity ot Marmarth, in the southwestern
corner of the state.
Governor Hanna has already taken
the matter up with Dean K. J. '.Bab
cock, head of the School ot Mines at
the State University, and also with
Dr. A. (,. Leonard, head of the Geo­
logical Survey of the State. The gov­
ernor requested these officials to in­
vestigate the matter and aB a result,
of the investigation Dr. Leonard has
.made the following report:
"Since I was already quite familiar
with the geology of tliat section of
thi» state, having located the anti­
cline, or fold, near Marmarth in 150!,
it was not necessary to spend as
much time as otherwise would have
been required for investigation. The
presence of this well marked anti­
cline near town furnishes one of thf
necessary conditions for the accuuiu*
lalion of oil and gas. In searching
for the best place to prospect for oil
and gas, the geologist always looks
for these anticlines, since it is in
these that the oil and gas will accu­
mulate when present in the rocks.
The anticline near Marmarth is,
therefore, a very favorable indication
and makes .it, seem quite likely that
gas, and possibly oil, will be struck
by putting down a well. The finding
of gas at Baker, only 12 miles distant,

DR. WAITE FOUND
GUILTY AND WILL
DIE IN THE CHAIR
manded to his cell in the Tombs this
afternoon.
District Attorney Swann said to­
night that if an appeal were taken,
his office would be ready in ten days
to argue the case in the higher court.
Waite ueclined to make any state
ment from his cell, but said lie might
issue "some impression" later.
That he was inclined to accept the
verdict as final and was resigned to
his fate seemed to be indicated by
his' remark, "This is a great relief,"
as he was led from the court room.
The dentist, who admitted not Only
the murder of Mr. Peck, but also the
murder of Mrs. Peck, his mother-in
law, and who admitted eh attempted
to kill his wife's aunt," Miss Kather
ine Peck, apparently had no doubt
the Jury would convict him.
(Here are the eyes of the men who h^ve made the insanity plea iq
the two most famous American murder-trials where such a defense'has
bpen entered. Can you see any similarity?
Above the eyes of Dr. Arthur Warren Waite, whose attorneys are try
ing to save him from the chair by the claim that he was insane when he
poisoned his father-in-law, the millionaire A.John Peck.
E'elow are the .eyes, of Harry Thaw, who shot Standford White to
death and was sent to Matteawan after jury found him .criminally in­
sane.
Alienists generally agree that ih. insane persons more of the whites
of the eyes are visible than in thoSe of- normal mind. Thaw's large,
peculiar eyes attracted much attention his trial. Waite's eyes are
smaller than those or Thaw." ,* j/f .j

General Obregon and many other
officials are satisfied that Villa is
dead," said Mr. Douglas. "I, too, am
of that opinion. He has not been
seen either by Mexicans or Amenean
soldiers for over two months. It is
not his nature to stay in seclusion so
long."

not to consider the proposal for im­

the question of withdrawal would not

Against Juror
Minneapolis, Minn., May 27.—After
Judge Daniel Fish dismissed con­
tempt charges against Albert Bastyr,
foreman of the L'ragdon jury,1 and
asked the county attorney to make a
more searching inquiry into the
charges of perjury and bribery in
connection with Bastyr's conduct,
Bastyr filed an affidavit explaining his
vote in favor of acquitting Bragdon,
and asked that the record be purged
of accusation against him.
"I would rather be right than be a
popular idol, so long as my own con­
science assures me I have done
right," Bastyr said.
Allen Martinsen, a' witness at the
Bragdon trial, who gave information
to the jury, which she repudiated at

with the murder of his former sweet­
heart, Marion Lambert, will have
music to wile away Sundays and the
long evenings during the trial. Judge
Charles H. Donnelly, before he ad­

quest of James O'Shea, one of the
eight jurors sworn in, to have his
phonograph brought in, so that he
might entertain his fellow jurors. The
court said however, that the records
must be of various kinds, such as a
few hymns, ballaas, ragtime songs,
band and orchestra selections, and
the like, as among the- jurors there
are a Zionite," an Irishman, a German,
and others of various religious denomi­

Although a special afternoon ses­
