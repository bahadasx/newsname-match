SPEED CRAZE
MAYOR COMMENDS ARTICLE IN
FRIDAY'S PAPER AND ISSUES A
STATEMENT WARNING SPEED
ERS FOR LAST TIME.
Mayor Mullen yesterday commend
ed very highly the article in Friday's
paper relative to speeding automobiles
and added that he was going to warn
people in this city about fast driving
and letting children drive for the
last time, and after this there will be
some drastic action taken, if the law
is violated. In speaking of this mat
ter, Mayor Mullen said:
"I wish that the first father or
mother you meet who has a ;hild
that drives a car you ask him about
how his child drives, and he will tell
you 'All right,' but ask him about
the way Jones' or Smith's child drives
their car and he will say 'They
should be arrested.' Most all people
are blind to their faults. I further
wish all people would look at the
speedometer on their car, and see
how fast they travel these streets.
The speed limit in the business dis
trict is twelve miles; in the resi
dence district fifteen miles. Take a
person coming from the country
clubs: They will spend an extra hour
talking gossip and as soon as they
start home they think that the slow
est time should be twenty mile3.
"We are all becoming speed crazy.
Now, this is about the last time I am
going to warn people. If I get you,
your child or your wife up here in
court for speeding, do not come up
and say 'It is my first time,' or
'Jones was going faster than I,' but
come on up prepared to pay a fine,
that Is, if you are guilty. There Is
absolutely no use of killing two or
three people before we stop this
speed craze. Another matter all of
you who have little children will have
to stop them from driving cars. The
ordinance provides that no one under
sixteen shall have a license."
Several accidents have been nar
rowly averted within the past few-
days, and the mayor says he is de
termined to put a stop to the practice.
Esperson's Good Fortune
The friends of Neils Esperson of
Houston will rejoice to learn that he
has recently brought in a big well
in the Humble field in Texas. The
production Is reported here at 20,(100
barrels a day. In this one lease Mr.
Esperson has 500 acres. It Is the
largest lease in that field and the
prospects are that every foot of it is
in the producing area. Some six years
ago Mr. Esperson had reverses in the
business, but he has come again and
has properties worth several million
dollars. He was a purchaser at Heald
ton in the early days and has a light
production here now, but has disposed
of much of his local holdings. He
thought well of the northwest portion
of Healdton and made purchases of
lands in fee In that district.
S. W. Terry of Olenn was an Ard
more visitor yesterday. He reports
that all kinds of crops out his way
are growing nicely.

THREE OFFICIALS OF WASHING
TON BANK WERE ON TRIAL ON
CHARGE OF PERJURY FOUND
NOT GUILTY.
Washington, May 27. The three
Riggs bank officials on trial for per
jury were found not guilty today after
the jury, had been out nine minutes.
Charles C. Glouer, president. V. J.
Flather, Vice-president and H. II.
Flather, former cashier, were the de
fendants. The government contended
that when in the celebrated case of
the bank against Secretary McAdoo
and Comptroller Williams, the three
officials signed an affidavit that the
hank had never engaged in stock mar
ket transactions, they had perjured
themselves.
The defense was that the signing of
the affidavit meant that the bank it
self had not dealt In stocks, but not
to deny that the bank's officers had
executed transactions for depositors
and customers in their personal ca
pacities. It's On to Dixie.
The word is "on Into Dixie." The
northwest extension keeps climbing
to the north and to the northwest.
Acreage is selling at good prices and
plans are being made to drill wells
far up that way and the different
arms of the Healdton field promise
to be many miles in length. Only
the surface of oil production in south
ern Oklahoma has been touched.
There are Just as good investments
now as there was when Healdton
was discovered, and when many for
tunes were made. It's only a question
of taking a chance In all the active
territory.

Fortune in Carter County.
Since the days when C. H. Shafer of
Chicago made a ten million dollar
fortune out of Oklahoma oil has there
been such an individual fortune made
as J. L. Hamon has accumulated in
the Ardmore fields. He has substan-
: tial holdings in sections 4, 10, 3, 15,
i 22, 33, and up in section 30, and In
i the northwest extension he has 260
! acres. There is not any way to es
timate how much wealth these hold
ings will give up but a well Informed
oil man said Mr. Hamon's northwest
nrnnnrtv fllnne was Worth UD Into
t- .
the millions. Mr. Hamon will leave
here on the second day or June to at
tend the Chicago convention. He Is
the friend of P.ig Jim Harris in his

THE EPISCOPAL
HAS CLOSED
MAKE PROVISION FOR CARE OF
THE AGED CLERGY WOMAN'S
AUXILIARY SHOWS PROGRESS
OKLAHOMA CITY NEXT MEET.
The annual convocation of
the Kpiscopal church of that part
of the state lying on the west of the
main line of the Santa Fe railroad
has just, closed. The people oT St.
Philip's church and other good peo
ple of Ardmore united in entertaining
it very efficiently and hospitably.
The opening service was at eight
o'clock Tuesday evening, when a
strong sermon was preached by llish
op Thurston of eastern Oklahoma.
Wednesday morning at 9 o'clock, af
ter the communion service, Bishop
llrooke delivered his annual address,
as is customary, summarizing the
results of the work for the past year
and suggesting plans for that to,
come ,and also giving a review of
the work of the church at large In
some of its more important features.
The convocation was then organized
and proceeded with its business, elect
ing J. M. Pettit of El Reno as sec
retary, C. J. Shepard of Pawnee being
reflected treasurer, and the dele
gates to the general convocation cho
sen were Hev. John Coughry of Paw
nee and C. O. Hunn of Ardmore; al
ternates, Hev. V. C. Griffith, Norman
and J. P. White of Oklahoma City.
Each day the members of the con
vocation and the families of their
hostesses were entertained at lunch
in the parish house adjoining the
church. This was a most pleasant
feature. Each afternoon from 2 to 4
was given to the business of the
Woman's Auxiliary .Missionary So
ciety, presided over by Mrs. T. H.
Dwyer of Chickasha. Their reports
and discussions showed encouraging
progress.
Rev. E. H. Eckel, the secretary of
the tenth province was with us and
preached on Wednesday evening, and
the preacher on Thursday night was
Rev. F. J. Hate of Oklahoma City,
who preached a sermon of unusual
Interest. Thursday was occupied
chiefly in the routine business, re
ports of important committees, among
which was one reviewing the division
paper, the Oklahoma Churchman, and
providing a plan for its management.
One most important matter was the
appointment of a commission to co
operate with the proposed plan for a
pension fund for the aged or dis
abled clergy of the church. Ilishop
Thurston, who presented the matter
before the convocation, carefully ex
plained the methods proposed, and
what was asked of this district and
! how the reserve fund was to be raised.
No part of the business of the con
vocation was felt to be more import
ant than this.
The convocation adjourned to meet
next year in Oklahoma City, not. as
for some years past, in May, which
has proved to be an Inconvenient
time, but in September.
As delegates to the general con
vention, which meets in St. Louis,
Mrs. T. H. Dwyer of Chickasha and
Mrs. H. II. Sayre of Ardmore were
chosen.
ATI
Washington, 1). C, May 27.
The military conferences be
tween (lencral 1'ershing and
Gavira will not discuss the
withdrawal question.
General Funston's orders to
Pershing explicitly prohibit tho
discussion of this subject.
'Co-operation between the
Americans and Mexicans in
chasing the bandits was the
basis on which the Mexican of
ficers sought the meeting. The
conferences probably will be
held at Pershing's headquar
ters at Namiqtiipa.
Gavira Wants Withdrawal
El Paso, Tex., May 27. General Ga
vira telegraphed to General' Pershing
today suggesting that in view of tho

could confer tiy telegraph and said
that since many Mexican soldiers
were being sent into that territory,
that ho could see no reason for the
Americans remaining.

In today's Ardmorelte the school
board is carrying an advertisement
calling for bids for the erection ol

creased attendance of the schools dur
ing the past two years made thla

called a special election some time ago
to vote bonds for thla purpose. Forty
thousand dollars was voted which
means that ten thousand dollars will
be expended in each ward. Superin
tendent Richards stated yesterday
that he was going to remain on tho
job while the work was in progress
and within a short time contractors
will begin the additions.
