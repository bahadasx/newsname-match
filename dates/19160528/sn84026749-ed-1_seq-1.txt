Newspaper Editors Decide to
Protest Against Their Nomi

AIM ESPECIALLY AT COLONEL
CHICAGO, May 28. On the
eve of the nomination of Colonel
Roosevelt by the Bull Moose, Ger
man newspaper editors have serv
ed notice upon the Republican
chiefs that they will not stand for
Roosevelt or Root.
At the meeting of the executive
committee of the German News
paper Publishers' Association, in
which Bernard Ridder was active,
U was decided to submit their pro
test formally to the Republican
convention.
' A resolution will be lent to the
Republican managers telling of the
opposition "of the' German editors
to Roosevelt and,Root, and stating
that aside from these two, the Gcr
' mans have no favorite candidate.
ANXIOUS" TO BEAT T. R.
The request will be made that the
resolution be read to the convention
The Germans are particularly anxious
to defeat Roosevelt.
The G.0. P. managers are to be told
they can expect nothing from the Oer
man-Americans If they permit his noml
nation.
Campaign headquarters for Theodore
Roosevelt, as a candidate for the Re
publican nomination for President, will
be opened In Chicago this week.

for the convention.

The East is going to take care that
the convention Is not stampeded.
Hllles, as a delegate from New York,
will vote for Root on the first ballot.
Not to Block Nomination.
The rumor that the "Old uuard"
would attempt to embarrass tne
presentation of the name of Colonel
Roosevelt in the Republican conven

about that Colonel Roosevelt would be
asked to declare that he would be a
candidate only In the Republican con
vention. "There Is nothing to such talk and
any individual delegate Ib privileged
to put before the convention the name
of Colonel Roosevelt," said one of the
men who will sit in and help to make

THIRD GREAT CRISIS,
ROOSEVELT WRITES
Structure of Government Lags Generation
Behind Economic Development, Former
President Declares in Article on "Na
tionalizing the United States"---Work
Begun by Lincoln Remains Unfinished.
By THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
"After the war Europe will be the new land and America the old
land," was the remark with which a statesman, returning from a year's
travel in the belligerent countries, foretold the future. In European
countries the development of a whole generation has been crowded
by the stress of the war into two short years. Great waves of popular
emotion have unified and solidified
tries. The fellowship of common danger and the .struggle shoulder to
shoulder in the common work has carried them to new forms of nation
al organization. Some of the governments abroad have already learned
and the others are rapidly learning to mobilize the energies of their en
tire population to a single task.
The financial power of the banking structure in each country
has worked hand in hand with the government, exactly as the
government has; worked with the bankers. Big business has been
organized and encouragedMy the government so. that . it has be
come 'a new source of national 'power;.' abbrf and the public
have learned to work in closer co-operation with their business
men, and the business men of each country, in proportion as that coun
try has been successful, have conditioned their work on a spirit of frank
accommodation to the needs of the public and of labor. In short, ne
cessity has taught the nations to discover latent sources of power.
Must Watch Against Other Nations.
The progress that has been made will carry over into peace and
will tell in the organization for the work of peace. The people the
business men, the farmers, the wage workers of the United States
must be able to match themselves against the nations abroad, when
they shall have been strengthened and solidified by their adherence to
various national ideals. More than ever it is true today that a really great
national life is possible to us only if
men, but using our collective strength as citizens of a mighty nation,
building and transmitting to our children a social structure wherein we
have used and profited by the accumulated forces of the' past. The big
things of the modern world can be accomplished only if we clasp the
hands of our fellow-men and work
ends. Our patriotism unconditioned by the hyphen must be real.

Clash Feared Between De Faoto

EI, PASO, Tex., May 28. With thirty
thousand Carranza soldiers In the state
of Chihuahua, where the United States
Is operating; a scant 13,000, military men
are becoming fearful of a serious clash
between the soldiers of the de facto
Mexican government and the United
States.
There is little fear of the outcome of
such a clash, but the effect that It might
have on the future peace of the United
States Is what Americana fear.
Gradually, for several days past, the
Carranza officials have been moving
their men In such a manner as to com
pletely surround the American forces.
It Is claimed In official quarters that

CHARTER ISSUENEXT
RIEGS UK FIGHT
Financial Circles Eagerly Await
Comptroller's Decision on
Regrant of Franchise.
MANY EXPECT RENEWAL
Whether the Itlggs National Bank will
recelvo Its charter from Comptroller of
the Currency John Skclton Williams on
June 27, or will be forced to relinquish
its privileges as a memDer or me na
tional banking system. Is a question
concerning which speculation is rife, in
political and financial circles today.
No one knows what decision, If any,
has ben reached concerning the charter.
except comptroller Williams, ana ne re
fuses to comment as to which way the
pendulum will swing in the next chap
ter of the great controversy of politics
and flnanc.
Charged with perjury, and tried there
on, three officials of the bank, Charles
C Glover, president; William J.
Flathcr. vice president, and Henry H.
Flathcr, former cashier, have emerged
from the ordeal with rcDUtatlons un-
smirched. Had they been convicted tho
right of tho Comptroller to deny a re
newal or cnarter to tnio institution
whose affairs they conduct could not be
questioned.
Bank Expects Charter.
Friends of the bankers and of the
Comptroller In many Instances lean to
ward the Impression that the latter will
bring the noted controversy Itlggs
National Dank versus Treasury Depart
ment omciais to an aDrupt climax at
tne eievenui nour tY rearantlnr the
charter nf lh luink-
urnciais of mi nan letU he Known
today that, whether or no this action
Is taken by the Comptroller, tho bank
will not be halted in the transaction or
Its affairs along lines similar to those
It has pursued as a national Institution.
The denial of the charter means that
the institution will be compelled
to withdraw from the Federal
reserve system, but this, in the
'opinion of tho itlggs orncers, need
not cause them any worry. They reel
that their Institution, so their friends
say, is ns much of an asset to the
federal reserve system as tne system
is to tho lllggs National liank.
Equity Suit Not Vital.
When Justlco McCoy, who heard tho
equity suit of the bank against Secre
tary McAdoo, Comptroller Williams,
and Treasurer Burke, will hand down
his decision, and what the court's ruling
win be In the matter is a question ot
minor Import to the bank officials. This
decision carries no weight one way or
tno other now, one ot tne DnnK-s oi
fleers, acting as spokesman for his
confreres, declared today.
The one question In mind Is the char
ter Issue, and this hangs In doubt so
long as the Comptroller of Currency

Crown Prince Still Hammering
Away Despite Staggering
Losses Without Real Gains.
TAKES TROOPS FROM EAST
LONDON, May M. Bringing fresh
divisions Into action, tho crown
prince is hammering1 away at the
"key fortress to the road to Paris,"
apparently undauntod by his stag
gering losses.
The unparalleled attacks on Verdun
continue with varying fortunes, tho
new week starting with the French
having regained most of the ground
won by the Oermans at such bloody
cost.
Latest reports show that on Thurs
day alone the crown prince lost 16,000
men in hfa terrific attacks, and the
total losses reaching half a million,
three-fourths of whom were Gcr-,
mans. j
With heavy re-enforcements, the re-1
newed assaults are expected to be'
markod with even heavier casualties..
Military experts here say thatQen

allies.

plea for peace.
The last official statement from the
French war office reported a French
advance southwest o? Dead Man's
Hill. Lively artillery fighting con
tinued on tho whoto Verdun front to
day. The Germans attacked French lines
In the Champagno last night, and
reached points In the French advance
lines west of the Navarln road. They
were promptly ejected by a counter
attack. All Staked on Verdun.
The withdrawal of troops from the
eastern front, where Von Hlndenburg
was soon to start another drive against
the Dvlnsk line, tends to indicate that
the Kaiser Is staking everything on the
taking of Verdun.
In detail, tho French have captured
several sections of trenches to the
southwest of Dead Man's hill, and part
of tho vlllago of Cumleres, also they
havo repulsed efforts to gain ground In
th vlclnltv of Fort Douaumont. In the
Thlaumont wood sector, nearby, tho
Crown Prince's troops havo gained to
the southward.
Italian and Austrian accounts vary
regarding the campaign In the Trentlno,
but Roma admits a retirement from an
advanced position on the Astlco river.
The Italians say a sanguinary de
feat was Inflicted upon the Austrlans In
the Lagarlna valley and that the foe
has been held In check along all other
sectors, thus blocking the attempt to
win the road to the Venetian provinces.
Vienna Claims Gains.
Vienna, qn the other hand, announces
a sweeping success 1n the capture of
the entire mountain ridge from Corno
clcamno Verde to Maata. and pro
nounced successes over the Itnllans
north of Arslero, where tho crest of
Monte Clgono has been captured.
In the Balkans, artillery engagements
are prevalent on the Macedonian front,
where the Franco-British forces and the
armies of the Teutonla allies aro facing
each other.

BERLIN. May K (via. London, May
ro.-V'Nothlng can shake my confldenco
that peace is on its way," Upltcd
States Ambassador James Gerard is
quoted as saying in an interview pub
lished in a Munich newspaper from its
Berlin correspondent,
vjn the interview the ambassador
refera to tho settlement or tho differ
ences between the United Stntea and
Germany oa nn event paving the way
to take up the question of peace.
"President Wilson has much greater
freedom of action now to deal with tho
Immenso world problem which will de
termine the future attitude of nearly
all countries of the globe," tho am
bassador said.
Says Facts Must Speak.
"It Is useless to discuss at this mo
ment teh question as to whether
Prosldent Wilson's intermediation Is
deslrablo or probable," he continued.
"In this nnstanco facta alone must
speak, and one of the most Important
facts is that the neutrals are probably
as much Interested In bringing about
an enrly peace as the belligerents.
"America urgently needs peace, and
for this reason alone the American
Government is under an obligation to
Its citizens to do and support every
thing that serves the cause of peace
A fact of chief Importance is that my
government is really willing to tako
action ror tno promotion oi peace.
"I am very optimistic regarding the
progress already made of tlio Idea
that the war should bo ended, even
among belligerent nations. The wise
and moderato words, of te)i German
chancellor regarding Germany's
readiness to make peace had prob
ably their strongest echo In Amerlpa
and strengthen the impression that
Germany will take all further steps
calmly and with confidence.
Will Leave Nothing Undone.
"When another step will be taken and
what shape the further development of

"I hardly know from what quarter the

ACCEPTED AS
BIG STEP TO
END OF WAR
Officials and Diplomats See
Great Significance ki Execu
tive's Announced Doctrine.
EXPECT BERLIN TO ACCEPT IT
First Suggestion That United
States Might "Initiate" Move
to Stop Hostilities.
President Wilson's speech be
fore the League to Enforce Peace
was accepted by officials and dip
lomats today as the most significant
utterance in furtherance of peace
since the -world war began.
The greatest signficance was
placed in the President's state
merit that he felt the "world it
even now upon the eve of a great
consummation.''
German circles particularly were
tremendously interested in Presi
dent Wilson's "peace creed.''
Washington correspondents ol
German papers construed the
President's overtures for peace as
a response to the statements ol
the German chancellor and othei
German statesmen that Berlin i:
ready to discuss peace on terms it
has outlined.
OUTLINE OF U. S. COURSE.
Another deeply significant part of thi
President's speech was hla outline ol
tho course the Unltod States woul
tako "If It should ever bo our prlvlleg
to suggest or Initiate a movement foi
reace among the nations now at war."
This was the first time the Presldcn'
ever had suggested that ho might lnl
tlate a move for peace. Always here,
tofore he has taken the position that h
should not act until requested to do at
by a belligerent.
It waa noticeable todav that Gerroal
comment on the speech was almost unan
lmous that it would bo received favor
ably In Berlin. German commentator!
were not sure that the speech wnul(
meet as favorable a reception in Grca:
Britain nnd tho allied countries.
The President's passage referring t
"security of tho highways of the seat
for the common and unhindered use
all the nations nf the world" was ac
cepted in German quarters aa a re
snonso to Germany's demand for free
dom of the seas and lellcf from thi
British blockade. ,
Open to Two Constructions.
This passage was open to two con
structions, however, as It also was heli
to convey protest against Oerman sub
marlno warfare.
President "Wilson specifically dls
claimed any Idea of discussing a pro

only was avowing a cxeed.
