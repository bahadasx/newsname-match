ANQ...ER WAVEAWAITS OPINIONS
a
OF
L
STATE
REPORT THAT RAILROADS WILL
RECEIVE SHIPMENTS FOR
PERSONA! USE
ATTORNEY GENERAL JONES IS
UNAWARE OF THE
MATTER
PHOENIX. Mav 27 Liquor ship
ments will be accepted by railroads
running into Arizona, under the per
sonal use decision of the state su
preme court This wil be the sub
stance of an announcement by the
railroads within three days, it was
learned yesterday on substantial au
thority That he could take no stand on a
matter which he said was news to him
was the statement of Attorney Gen
eral Wiles Jones when apprised of the
situation yesterday.
Believing that no test case would
settle the matter of personal use and
that each attempt to Import llpuor
under the supreme court s interpre
tation of the law would necessitate
a separate trial the common carriers
have shied wide of accepting ship
ments A good deal of attention has
been paid to the matter by railroad
attoraevs and by a traffic assccia
tion, representing all the carriers.
When the personal use decision was
announced and a furore of expecta
tion not to say glee, swept the state,
the railroads hurried around with a
let of wet blankets and cooled tons
and tons of ardor by being lnter
. lowed on the subject of not ac
cepting shipments Since then, the
matter has simmered the phrase
"personal use" has become firmly
flxed In the Arizona vocabulary as a
svnonym for booze, and the attitude
of expectancy has been gradually but
surely relaxed. Now. probably bj
this screed, it will be mere or less
tautened, until either the next cold
douche is applied or else the matter
Is settled to the certain Joy of the
lover of his tipple.
Statements that the railroads had
decided to announce a willingness to
carry liquor for personal use were
definite enough. But as to details
well, there simply were none. Ques
tioned as to the facts concerning
"shipping" and "bringing" In the eyes
of the law, th" attorney general was
non-committal, though he believed
the supreme court had held that if
it is legal to bring in a mite of
liquor, it Is also legal to have It sent
In.
A week ago the state was flooded
with circular letters from an eastern
brewery promising nay, guarantee
ing to ship barreled beer Into the
state at a figure that made bootleg
prices look like the list of munitions
stocks. With the hopes, this an
nouncement campaign also raised a
perfect fever of thirst.

WATCHFU
WATNG
OF
REGISTRATIONS
oumv Iticorder Owen E Murphy
has written to Attorney Wiley E.
Jnncs fcr an cjiniuu uu the non parti
san registration question. A number
of those who have already registered
have written in to have their regis
trations changed so as to now Insert
a party where they refused or neglect
ed ts name their party affiliations at
the time they registered.
The general impression here Is that
blanks as -they have subscribed and
sworn to before a notary public. If
the changes w ere to be allowed there
would be opened a chance to defeat
the very purpose of the new law that
requires a voter to express his party
qualification at thetime he registers.
For Instance what would prevent a
party of Democrats or Republicans
getting together about a week before
the primary and put up a Job to go
In and nominate a certain party on
either ticket by several hundred of
them changing their blanks at that
time Everyotie would have a right
to change his party affiliation as
often as he changed his mind and th
books would be one mess of changes
Mr. Murphy has also asked for an
opinion on the same question from
Countj Attoreny J. F. Ross. As
soon as the opinions are received
they will be made public. In the
meantime it behooves those who have
not registered to see that they ex
press their parts affiliation when they
do register
FROM TOUR OF
GOUNTY
The boird of supervisors returned
from their tour of the northern part
of the county. They report the coun
ts' In that section as being prosperous.
There will be several thousand head
of cattle shipped from the WIllcox
country and that In the vicinity of
Bowie there is considerable mining
excitement At San Simon the town
is improving, there Is considerable
ore being hauled in there from the
Chiricahua mountains and the Para
dise country and shipped to the El
Paso smelters. Thf new bridge ma
terial to be built by the county over
the wash east of there has been re
ceived and the work will be started
within a short time. At Johnson and
Dragoon the party found that there
are over lSOO men at work In that
district and more ore being shipped
than ever from that locality!
