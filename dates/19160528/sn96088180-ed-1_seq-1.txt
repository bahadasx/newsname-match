I'otrograd. May 27.The United
States faces tremendous difficulties in
any attempt to negotiate a new com
mercial treaty with Russia to replace
the one abrogated during the Taft
administration because of the Jewish
question. ' ,
This was learned by the United
Press today on the highest authority.
"Negotiations were begun alx
months too late," It waa atated. "The
allies are now perfecting a trade
agreement among themselves. Until
it Is oonoluded, Ruaala will make no
outside! arrangements. '. France Is
bound io enoounted difficult!, at
least momentarily. . '
"If the treaty Is accomplished at
all, It must confine Itself to economics
and not enter iuto discussion of Rus
sia's Internal affair."
Count Kokokvtsoff, former premier
end former minister of finance, In an
exclusive Interview granted , the
United Press, made It plain that Rus
sia would consider no treaty In which
Its treatment of Jews was made an
Issue. .,
"I am not an antl-Jew,'r be said;
"my record la proof of this."
"I admire America." aald tha
count. "I welcome American coopera
tion In building Industrie and rail
roads and opening vast' resources of
raw material of every sort. Before
the war Germany had made no special
demand on Russia. It waa too keen.
Having ulterior motives, It scattered
the wildcat etorica against Russia,
making trouble and meanwhile vir
tually monopolixlng trade. ' 1 "t
"American ought to reallxe that
Russia cannot entertain outside sug
gestions regarding Internal affairs.

others, leaving, Russia to settle Its

Following the opening numbers of
the program, Superintendent Hull In

Pass high school, then known as tha
Grants Pas academy, v
Mr. Pollock spoke interestingly of
the esrly days of the school which
hsd now gained a position among the
leading institutions of the kind in
the state He told of the first class
grsduated In 1888, the four mem
ber of which now lived In as many
atates. But the deeper interest of
the remark of Mr. Pollock was 1
around hi reference to the success
that had attended the man who was
principal of the school when Its first !
graduates received their diplomas.
That .first principal was Prof, Henryl
L. Benson, now a member of the
supreme bench of the state of Ore
gon, and he was Introduced by Mr.
Pollock to the Grants Pass public af
ter an absence of a quarter of a cen
tury as the principal speaker of the
evening. ;

pioneering In the local educational
field, and said that he much prefer
MEMORIAL DAY.
Where once where Southern battlefields,
The meadows lie now fresh and green;
Fair valley, mountains, hill and plains,
Make up a far-spread peaceful scene.
The Southland blossoms, many years,
Have blossomed with warmer, brighter hue
And purer white, because they grow ,
In soli made rich by grey and blue.
Brave blood, it was, enriched this sotl,
Where now earth's fairest flowers send
Their fragrance outward, to pervade '
The air where peace and beauty blend.
Time' healing hand has kindly brought
Forgiveness for wound and scar;
Forgetfulness of what once seemed '
Were cruel wrongs and cause for war. v

Forgotten now the bitterness; .
Each side concedes the other fought

Revenge alone was what they sought.

red to have a friendly talk with bis
old neighbors than to attempt to as
cend to height of oratory in address
ing the people of Grants Pass and the
graduating class.' His address, how
ever, was a most able effort, and held
the closest attention of all a the
words of advice and good cheer fell
from his Up. h . . . '
Th central thought of the address
wa that no profession or calling was
over-crowded for the man or "woman
who was willing to pay tha price of
success determined and Intelligent
effort : 'n ? '
"If there was a Spurgeon or a
Beecher for every town, the problem
of the Sunday night movie would
setUe itself," said tha speaker. That
there were too many mediocre law

Judge admitted, but no profession
or calling was closed to the young
man or young woman who went into

will to arise above the Jostling crowd
at the bottom. As an Incentive to
individual "endeavor along original
lines, tho speaker quoted Elbert Hub

wear a path to the center of a wil
derness if therein dwelt the man who
could write a better book or make a
better r mouse-trap than could, his
