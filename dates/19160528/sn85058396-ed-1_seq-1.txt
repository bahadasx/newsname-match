is at your disposal "

James H. Wllkerson, attorney for Will

Its plans to the defense.
Hartman is said to have visited
Mr. Wllkerson last Monday and to
have told the lawyer a story concern
ing Marion Lambert. He said that
Clara Cramer, his cousin, a domestic
employed at Lake Forest, told Miss
Lambert that Hartman had a drug
which would relieve her condition.
Hartman said he gave Miss Lambert
the drug.

to be in Toledo and Mr. Wilkerson
sent one of his partners to tho Ohio
city to investigate. Hartman reported
that Miss Cramer had come to Chi
cago and promised to produce her for
confirmation of the story last Satur

and today Mr. Wllkerson demanded to
know If tho state was detaining Hart
man. Mr. Dady admitted today that he

Rome, Sunday, May 28, via Paris,

In the absence of satisfactory evi

Pope is unable to pass judgement on

C. L. McKnight, chief clerk to Gen
eral Agent W. H. Chovers of the
Union Pacific, has returned homo
from Dubuque, Iowa, where he en
joyed a two-weeks' vacation visit with
relatives.
Aside from fishing, at which he is
an expert, and other recreation, Mr.
McKnight lound much to interest him
in the way of taking note of busi
ness conditions. The outlook for big
crops in Iowa this season, he said,
is unusually good as no killing frosts
seemed to have visited the immense
farming districts tributary to the
Union Pacific railroad in that state.
The hay and grain fields are green
and the manufacturing plants in the
larger cities are being operated to full
capacity.
In the city of Dubuque, however,
the Ogden man noted poor business
conditions, due to the enforcement of

PEACE TALK IS .
GIVENJITIIS ;:
Irresponsible Rumors and
American Comments Are '
Reviewed in English
Papers.
London, May 29.-11:30 a. m. "Ir-
responsible peace talk received its '
quietus from Sir Edward Grey last ,
week, but no doubt President Wilson's
speech before the League to Enforce
Peace will revive the discussion in
certain quarters," says the Liverpool
Post. "Its definiteness in certain par
ticulars is arresting, but perhaps to
many of his own countrymen tho air
of definiteness which the president (
gives to some of his phrases may seem j
elusive.
"One can imagine many being spec
ially disappointed when he says that !
with the causes and objects of the J
To us, who believe we are opposing
an attempt at world nominating, it is
hard to believe that tho cause for
which we stand is not of some con- J
cern to the great republic of the
west."
Allies Fighting for World Peace.
The Post argues that the entente al
lies are fighting for virtually the same
object for which President Wilson pro
poses a league of nations.
The Manchester Guardian says this j
plan of the president is almost as old
as the first formulation of the ideal
of organized, peace, but that it never
before in any part of the world has I
commanded the support accorded it j
in America today.
This newspaper says further:
"Tho president inevitably has com j
terms, but it is Impossible to miss
the significance of his declaration that
the United States would be ready to
become a party to any feasible league
of nations. Twenty-one months of
war has done much to undermine even
the rooted American aversion from
alliances and leagues."
What Wilson Is Driving At.
Tho Westminster Gazette sayB that,
if ono Is to understand what President
Wilson In rlrlvinir at. his sieech must
bo considered from two points of view
tho immediate point of view of the
war and the more remote one of re
construction after the war .
It continues: J
"This proviso is necessary for the
president's neutrality 'in mind and
thought' is an ice cold abstraction for
a belligerent, who believes he Is fight- i
Ing in the sacred cause of law and
right. Wo do not understand how ft
neutral can expect to influence these
events if ho begins by declaring him
self not to bo concerned with their 1
causes and objects. We do not see ,
how he Is to control this 'stupendous
flood if he is not 'interested to search i
for or explore tho obsoure fountains
from which they burst forth'." ,
Presenting the argument that the
entente allies cannot bo expected to
welcome tho implied Judgment that
they really are responsible with their
enemies for starting tho war, tho
Gazette continues:
"Wo must guard ourselves in ad
vance against being thought unreason
able or aggressive If we are unable
to accept peaco overtures based on
the assumption of equal guilt."
