?h* belief that thfc interests of the j
whole party would be served by effect- |
tng an adjustme.-.t that would avert the
onruthing conf.it t at l'.oanoke. There
followed swiftly two ?onferences of

with the result that Mr. .Tames agreed,

his ambition.
JAMES \\ 11.L HEAD
STATE COMMITTEE
For his signal service in this hour
of need, Mr James will be rewarded
by being elected chairman of the State
Democratic Committee?a position now !
held by Lieutenant-Governor Eliyson. J
Mr. Eliyson made way for stKh an
adjustment by voluntarily announcing
that he will not I"1 a candidate for
re-elcction.
According to the apportionment inadt'
by the peace conference in Washing
ton. the honors will be distributed like
this-:
Carter Glass to be elected national
committeeman.
Rorer A. James, to be elected chair
man of the. State Democratic Commit
ter
Hal D Flood to be elected one of
the four delegates at large to the St.
Louis convention.
As far as could be learned last night,
hardly a voice will be raised in Roa
noke in opposition to this adjustment
of the controversy. Antiorganlza tion
men will have gained their main point?
the election of Mr. Glass as national
committeeman?and would, therefore,
find It embarrassing to oppose for elec
' Hon as delegate at large the single
organization leader who. throughout
the stormy campaign, has faithfully
stood by the Representative from tho
Sixth District. Likewise, no opposi
tion is expected to the election of Mr.
James as Mr. Ellvson's successor.
EM.YSON IS PLEASED
WITH COMPROMISE
Organization men united in hailing
the peace, terms ns admirably adapted
to heal the wounds that have been
dealt by the recent unpleasantness.
Happiest of all was the statement of
Lieutenant-Governor Eliyson, who. at
this day, still holds the two oflices
which, under the peace terms, will be
given by the Roanoke convention to Mr.
Glass and Mr. James.
"I ain more than satisfied,'" said Mr.
Eliyson. "I do not believe anything
more pleasing could have been sug
gested. Mr. Glass has rendered con
spicuous service to bis country, and his
flection as national committeeman will
be a gracious recognition of what ho
has done. Mr. James has been a most
active and eftlclent member of the State
committee, and Jie has the experience
and training that make him in every
way thoroughly qualified for the. duties
of State chairman.
"Mr. Flood has won the right to be
recognized as one of our foremost party
leaders, and his selection as one of the
delegates at large will meet with gen
eral approval. We go to Roanoke with
the assurance of a harmonious and
united convention, and we will set an
example to the country of how to lay
aside personal differences for tho good
of the State, and nation."
NO ISSUES EXPECTED
TO MA It CONVENTION
For the reasons hereinbefore stated,
as lawyers say, peace deep and tranquil
is expected to be the keynote of tho
convention which will meet In Roanoke
, on Friday. Where before lurked the
r monster of Internecine strife perches
now the snow-white dove.

WASHINGTON*. May 27.?S e n a t o r
Martin, Senator Swan son and Represen- !
taiives Flood. Watson and Saunders,
upon receipt of news herp that Colonel
Korer A .Tames had withdrawn from
the contest for national committeeman,
(.?earing the field for the unanimous;
election of Representative Carter Glass, 1
announced that they intended to sup-j
port Mr. Janus for the position of State ?
chairman of the Democratic Central
Committee, a position Lieutenant-Gov
ernor Eilyson wiii vacate at the Roa
noke convention.
Members of the Virginia delegation
were pleased at the prospect of party
harmony at Roanoke, and believe the
action of Mr. James will help the har
monious feeling.
Representative Flood, who has been
mentioned as the next State chairman,
said he would be glad to support Mr.
James for that position. Representa
tive Glass expressed gratification at the
outlook for harmony on the eve of a
national election.
The withdrawal of Mr. James, it is
believed, disarms a movement to bring I
out opposition to Senator Swanson for
renominatlon. as it is understood that
the friends of Representative Glass, had
the -itier been defeated at the Roa
noke convention, intended to move
heaven and earth to draw him into the
senatorial race. Failing to Induce Mr.
Glass to enter, their plan was to bring
out Harry St. George "Tucker, of Lex
ington.
til.ASS GREATLY I'LKASKD
AT IMtOSPUCT OK PKACE
When Representative Glass was in
formed this evening of Mr. James'
withdrawal and asked for a statement,
he said:
Assuming that your information is
definite as to there being no opposition
to me at the Democratic State Conven
tion for the position of national com
mitteeman. I may say that 1 am greatly
pleased at the prospect of peace at Roa- '
nuke and the subsidence of a bitter
intra party controversy. I have not seen
the announcement of which you speak
and know nothing of its terms or tenor.
Indeed, the whole denouement is an
utter surprise to me, as I had no inti
mation of anything of tho sort.
"You will oblige me by again saying
that my solo purpose in permitting the
use of my name for the place of na
tional committeeman was to respond
suitably to an overture for harmony
in \ irginla politics. I am deeply
grajified that the Democrats of the
State, regardless of factional division,
so quickly apprehended this fact and
so generously responded to the spirit
of the occasion. Far above the distinc
tion of being Virginia's national com
mitteeman. I value and shall always

I'nder the leadership of some of thoj

I
plans have beon formulated t<? raise j
a fund of for the enlargement
and endowment of Memorial Hospital. j
If the necessary funds are provided,)
it is proposed to erect, on land already ?
belonging to the institution, a six-;
story, fireproof hospital entirely for'
treatment of negroes, a specially de
signed hospital for the treatment of i
contagious diseases and a well- .
arranged and equipped nurses" home, j
Development of this institution along
liberal lines, it Is believed, will go i
far toward the upbuilding of Flich
mond as a medical center, strength
ening, as it will, the teaching and j
clinical facilities of the Medical <'ol-!
lege of Virginia, already ranked as j
one of the two first-grade schools of
medicine south of Raltim<>i ??. The cam
paign for funds, to close on .Itine 24, j
is to be conducted under personal
supervision of 1,. 'A. Morris, chairman
of the. board of the institution. Al
ready substantial assurances ot" sup
port have?been received, and, while no
announcement has been made by the
committees In charge, it is bclived that
by the time actual canvassing for con
tributions Is begun, there will be in
hand a nucleus assuring to those who
contribute fhe carrying out of the plan
as proposed.
FIRST STEP TAKEN TO
HHALI7.H A DIIEAM
Making a dream come true?-this la
what Memorial Hospital is now doing,
lit is a dream of service and efficiency,
of attaining the proud place of the
[leader amonc nil the hospitals of the
South, a peer of .lohns Hopkins, in Bal
timore, a ceirter of clinical research,
the pride of Richmond.
In its campaign for funds with which
to erect new buildings, the Memorial
is taking the rirst step in the realiza
tion of its dream. It may require a
decade or possibly more to realize the
whole of the vision, but before the
end of the present year the actual
verities in brick and stone and con
crete will arise, which will indicate
the first group of new buildings in
this larger and greater Memorial Hos
pital?the new building for negro pa
tients, the contagious hospital and the
home for nurses.
These three buildings are those, most
urgently needed. Memorial Hospital,"
as it stands to-day, is splendidly quali
fied to care for the general surgical
and medical cases which are brought
to its doors. But It has had no proper
place for the treatment of self-respect
ing negroes; no department which is
open to tho reception of patients af
tlictcd with contagious diseases.
In fact, ? 'i .-ill Richmond at the pres
ent time, there, is not a place, save!
the few charity beds in the rear of
tiie City Home, where a person with a
contagious or infectious disease may
be sent. The only course to bo fol
( lowed in the past has been to treat tho]
| patient at home, and for all the house-]
! hold to suffer tho embarrassment of.
I quarantine, and the danger of pos- j
j sible infection, or elae to be barred
, out of tho home, while it is turned
i Into a temporary hospital. Memorial
j plans to change all this.

UNITED STATES READY TO ACT
President. Makes Significant. AddrtitB
, Before League to Enforce
Peace. ?
: . *
WASHINGTON, May 27.?President
Wilson declared here to-night before
the League to Enforce Peace that the
United States was ready to join in any
feasible association of nations to pre
serve the peace of the world agaln?t
"political ambition and selfish hos
tility," and in service of "a common
order, a common justice and a com
mon peace." He expressed the hope
that the terms of peace which end the
war would include such an arrange
ment.
Outlining suggestions for peace,
which the President said he hoped the
United States would make if It had op
portunity to do so, he Included pro
vision for absolute freedom of the seas,
a contention which has been the key
stone of nil the diplomatic discussions
with Germany and Great Britain, and
virtual guarantees of territorial in'7
tegrlty and political independence.
"I am ?ure." said the President, "that
the people of the United States would
wish their government to move alon'tf
these. lines:
"First, such a settlement with re
gard to their own immediate interests
as the belligerents may agree upon. We
have nothing material of any kind to
nsk for ourselves, and are quite aware
I that we are In no sense or degree par
j ties to the present quarrel. Our in
terest is only in peace, and its future
guarantees.
"Second, a universal association of
the nations to maintain the inviolate
security of the highway of the seas
for the common and unhindered use
of all the nations of the world, and to
prevent any war, begun cither contrary
to treaty covenants or without warning
and full submission of the causes to
the opinion of the world?a virtual
guarantee of territorial integrity and
political independence."
OUTLINES FUNDAMENTALS
OF A LASTING PEACPi
The fundamentals of a lasting peace.
President Wilson said, he believed were:
"First, that every people has a right
to choose the sovereignty under which
they shall live. Like other nations,"
the President said, "we have ourselves
no doubt once and again offended
against that principle when for a little
while controlled by selfish passion, as
our franker historians have been hon
orable enough to admit; but it has be
, come more and more, our rule of life
and action.
"Second, that the small states of
the world have a right to enjoy the
same respect for their sovereignty and
for their territorial integrity that great
and powerful nations expect and In
sist upon.
"And third, that the world has a
right to be free from every disturb
ance of its peace that has Its origin In
aggression and disregard of the rights
of peoples and nations."
The outstanding lesson of the world
war. the President said, had been that
I the peace of the world must henceforth
| depend upon "a new and more whole
some diplomacy." '
"If this war has accomplished noth
ing else for the benefit of the world,"
he said, "it has at least disclosed a
great moral necessity and set forward
the thinking of the. statesmen of the
world bv a whole age. Repeated utter
ances of the leading statesmen of most
of the great nations now engaged in
war have made It plain that their
thought has come to this: that the
principle of public right must hence
forth take precedence over the indi
| vidual interests of particular nations,
and that the nations of the world must
in some way hand themselves together
to see that that right prevails as
against any sort of selfish aggression;
that henceforth alliance must not bo
set up against alliance, understanding
j against understanding, but that there
must be a common agreement for a
common object, and that at the heart
of that common object must lie tho
inviolable rights of peoples and of
ma nklnd."
WILLING TO II ECO ME PARTNER.
IN ANV FEASIBLE ASSOCLiTION
"So sincerely do we believe in these
things." said the President, in con
clusion, "that I am sure that I speak
the mind and wish of the people of
America when I say that the United
States is willing to become a partner
in any feasible association of nations
formed in order to realize these ob
jects and make them secure against
violation."
The President told his hearer* he h*4
not come to discuss a program, but
only to avow a creed and give expres
