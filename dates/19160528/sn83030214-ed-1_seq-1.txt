FREEDOM OF SEAS, WORLD ARBITRATION,
PRESIDENTS BASIS FOR MEDIATION
If it should ever he our privilege to suggest or initiate ?> move
ment for peace among the nationi now at war, I am sure that the
people of the United States would wish their government to move
along these lines:
First. such a settlement with regard to their own immediate in?
terests as the helligerents may agree upon. We have nothing ma?
terial of any kind to ask for ourselves, and are quite ?ware that we
are in no sense or degree parties to thc present quarrel. Our intcrcst
is only in peace and its future puaranlccs.
Second, a universal association of the nations to maintain the
inviolate security of the highway of the seas for the common and
unhindered use of all the nations of the world, and to prevent any
war begun either contrary to treaty covenants or without warning
and fu'l submission of the causes to thc opinion of the world?a vir
tual guarantee of territorial integrity and politieal independencc.

that in tho future may grow *nto tho greatest significanee in the).

defined the position of America as the greatest of the neutrala.
Afl to the immediate issues of the present struggle. Presi-*
dent Wilson declared that they must he settled among tho bel

States must be consulted in the drafting of the term? of peace.'
There were certain principles. ho declared, which this countn*M
wished to see establishod.
These were:
That every people ha** a right to choose the sov
ereignty under which they shall livej
That the small states of the world have a right tc
enjoy the same respect for their povereignty and for
their territorial integrity that great and powerful na?
tions expect and insist upon.
That the world has a right to be free from everv
disturbance of its peace that has its origin in aggreaB
?-ion and disregard of the rights of peoples and nationji.
A universal association of the nations to maintaln the

That th? I nited States i<- willing to become a part?
