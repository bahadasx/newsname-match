Mr. Hurleson's authority in urging
postmasters of many cities to bring

fTHVO candidates for the Republican
J. nomination for congress from the
First district were definitely an
nounced yesterday. They were Vernon
Whiting, editor of the Pawhuska
Capital, and Bert Chandler of Vinita.
Mr Whiting was in Tulsa yesterday
and mailed his filing to the secretary
of stato from here. Former Postmas
ter S E. Walling of Vlnlta, who is in
active charge of Bert Chandler's cam
paign, was also in Tulsa and an
nounced that Mr. Chandler's filing had
been mailed rrom vinnaa.
With the withdrawal of Eugene S.
Lawson and K. K. Sams, both of No
wata who have been mentioned as
possible candidates from this district,
the only other candidate until Mr.
Whiting got in the race, was .vi .
Chandler, but with two candidates al
ready out it is rumorea inai in num

liable to conclude to try for the nom

ever witnessed in the state is pre

Among local Republicans who have
been oiscusscd as probable candidates
for congress on the Republican ticket,
are P. J. Hurley, .lodge W. J. firegg.
Harry Rogers, A. A. Small and Bird
McOuire. Judge firegg declares that
he has no intention of being a can
didate and a recent letter received
from Mr. Hurley states thnt he also
will not make the race. He. however,
will return shortly from wnsnmgioo
and will make a formal statement of
his position as soon as he gets home.
Bird McOuire declares that he will
not be a candidate but there is a per
sistent report that he will change his

It is known that several big oil com
panies have been sounded out as to
how they feel toward Mr. McOuire by
a number of his admirers. A. A.
Small admits having a real desire to

condition as to candidates arises feels
committed to the candidacy ot lien

Officials interpreted the president's
address us a preliminary feeler for
peace in Europe. He outlined the
conditions on which the Pulled States
would move if it made a formal
niciliatoiy offer with the idea, it was
understood, ot learning now :
suggestions would be received abroad.
"I am sure," said the president,
"that tho people of the Cnited States
would wish their government to move
along these lines:
First Such a settlement with re
gard to their own immediate interests
as the belligerents may agree uyo...

sion of the causes to the opin
ion of the world a virtual
guarantee of territorial integrity and
political Independence."
Outline I'limlaiiienlal-,.
The fundamentals of a lasting
peace. President Wilson said he be
lieved were:
"First That every pjeople has a
right to choose the sovereignty under
winch they shall live. Like other na
tions we have ourselves no doubt once
and again offended against that prin
ciple when for a little wniie conironeu
by selfish passion as our iraimur His
torians have been honorable enough
to admit; but it has become more and
more our rule of life and action.
Second That the small slates oi
thn world have a right to enjoy tne
sunn, respect for their sovereignty and
for their territorial integrity inai
great and powerful nations expect and
insist upon.
And third That the world nas a
right to be free from every dlsiiirn
iince of its peace that has its origi'i
In Hiriiression and disregard ol tne
rights of people and nations."
Must Jluvo More Order.
The outstanding lesson of the world
war. the presldant said, had been that
thp peace of tne worm musi neuen
forth depend upon a "new and more
wholesome diplomacy
"if this war has accomplished noth
ing else for the benefit of the world,"
said he. "It has at least disclosed a
great moral necessity and set forward
the thinking of the statesmen of the
world by a whole age. Repeated ut
terance of the leading statesmen of
most of the great nations now en
gaged in war have made it plain that
their thought has come to this, that
the principal public right must
henceforth take precedence over the
Individual interests of particular na
tions and that the nations of the
world must in some way band them
selves together to see thut right pre
vails against any sort oi seitisii ag
gression:, that henceforth alliance
must not be set up against alliance
but that there must he a common
agreement for a common object and
that at the heart of that common ob
ject must lie the Inviolable rights of
peoples and of mankind."
Will Take Hand.
"So sincerely do we believe these
things," said the president in conclu
sion, "that I am sure that I spe;ik the
nnnd and wish of the people of Amer

What will Tulsa do with the hun
dreds of confirmed "dope heads" who
are responsible for at least 50 per
cent of the police calls and arrests?
Municipal Judge I avlt believes that
the city should provide a sanitarium
for these derelicts and he, as judge of
the police court, will sentence the
fiends to this institution until they
are cured of the drug habit.
"A city showing the growth and
prosperity of Tulsa should have a
place to which it could send tho users
of drill's win re they n Ight be cured,
he said yesterday at the polrt"e sta
tion as several men and women ad
dieted to the drug habit were being
searched by ofticers for concealed
quantities of morphine or cocaine.
"They are responsible for a great
part of the work in this department.
A larce pcrci iit:ig of the arrests are
the result of the use of some drug.
We find these fiends guilty; they are
sentenced to pay a fine and spend a
term in jail; they are unable to pay
the fine, spend several weeks in a
cell and the city Is at the expense of
feeding and caring for them and re
ceives nothing in return. It is Im
possible to place these men on the
streets to work, to do so might re
sult In their death because they are
not able to do hard work, their bod
ies being weakened by the long use
of the drug.
"I am convinced that could the city
provide a means of curing those ad
dicted to drugs it would render a far
greater service than sentencing them
to jail w here they are a drain on the
taxpayers. But there Is no other pro
vision made for them and as a result
the city spends hundreds of dollars
innuali in caring fur them, only to
turn thein back on the public, un
cured and in no better condition than
when arrested."
