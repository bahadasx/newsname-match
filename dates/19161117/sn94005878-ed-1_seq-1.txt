Chiraro. Nov. 1" -Presiilent Wil
sun han won 27(i votes In the electoral
ollegp, on the face of unofficial re
turns which now ure nearly complot e.
l'nless this result shoul.l be upnet by
recounts, a remote possilillity. Mr
Wilson will havn a majority of twon
tyono lectoral votea over lr.
HuKhes, who now la credited with l':tri
votes on thu basis of the unofficial returns.
The President's total was swelled
1o 276 Friday by the addition to Iiíb
column of New Hampshire and New
Mexico.
North Dokota had been conceded to
Mr. Wilson by the Itepuhllcan state
i nalrman, thus raising the President"
M'orn lo 2C9.
Then the news came that the count
had been completed in New Hamp
shire, showing a plurality of seventy
votes for Wilson. Heptibliians are in
sisting upon a recount In New Hamp
shire in the hone that mistakes will
he discovered sufficient to cliunge at
L ast thirty five. ,
Inasmuch as a change of only thirty-five
ballots would tie the vote in
New Hampshire, the Republicans now
are demanding a recount In the hope
oí restoring 'the state lo liuRlies' list.
New Mexico went Into the Wilson
column with the probability that it
will stay there. Wilsons lead over
Hughes in this state increased giadu
idly as tho returns came In until it
was 2,319 votes with only :'.i precincts
missing.
The returns from California reduced
the President's nuugiti in that state
hut not sufficiently to endanger his
hold on its electoral votes.
The latest figures received show
Wilson 2.28ti ahead of Hughes with
only IS precincts yet to be reported
Remiblican State Chairman Howell
has demanded a recount of the ballots
in California, and while this Is in
progress the attention of the nation
will be centered upon the outcome.
Chester H. Itowell, chairman of the
Republican Btate central committee.
nnd O. E. Cushing. chairman of the
Democratic state central committee,
were in accord In that both agreed
the outlying precincts still to be
