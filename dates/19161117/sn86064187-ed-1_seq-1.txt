The feeling between the present and

When Guthrie was selected as seat
of the territorial government, the gap
between the two towns widened, and
when finally the capital was removed
to Oklahoma City the enmity grew still
greater. In the past year or so, how
ever, citizens of hoth places have be
gun asking themselves why they should
carry on the fight which began before
many of them were horn. The result
is next Monday's meeting.

An eddy caused the accident, accord

The Scott carried the usual lights,
