passed a resolution appropria

tion and Mr Olmsted who has
been assisted by Engineer C H
Southworth of Los Angeles is
making a thorough investigation
of the San Simon and Gila river
watersheds
Mr Olmsted and Mr South
worth went over into New Mexi
co and examined conditions at
the head of all streams empyting
into the Gila river While on
this trip they were helped ma
terially by the last big flood of
several weeks ago After leav

He has gathered considerable
data which he will prepare for

session of congress sometime In
January
From what has been learned
so far in his investigations Mr
Olmsted is of the opinion that a
very simple and not costly rem
edy may be applied which would
make the Gila river during flood
times a very tame proposition
His plan is to go to the head of
all small streams or dry canyons
through which the great flow of
water copies down to the river
from the mouptajns and build
what he ternis check dains
These dams are built from ma
terial found on the ground- rock
bruBh burned timber- to be con
structed Into a dam circular in
shape the center to be lower
than the sides The water coming
down carrying a large amount
of silt would be checked in its
flow the silt would build up be
hind the dam and in
time check dam system was used sue 1
tation would grow
A series of these dams would
break the rush of water and by
the time it reached the river it
Would not be in large quantities
arid- the river would not be rf

One of the most delightful
events planned for next month
will be the fair of the Daughters
of Rebekah which will be given
at the Armory December 14th
15th and 16th
The Armory will be beautifully
decorated and booths will be ar
ranged on the sides and stage of
the hall During each evening
of the fair there will be danc
ing
A fair is a new kind of enter
tainment here and is one of the
most enjoyable events that can
be given The booths will be
presided over by pretty girls
with a winsome smile for every
one especially the boys tho the
omer gent is just as popular in
the eyes of the presiding belle of
the booth
Undoubtedly the Rebekahs
fair will be a grand success soc
ially and financially and in this
respect we might say that the
proceeds will be devoted to the
entertainment fund for the next
annual session of the Grand
Lodge of Arizona I 0 0 F
and the annual session of the
Rebekah Assembly which will
be held here next April
Safford was selected by the
Grand Lodge of Odd Fellows for
its 1917 session thus placing our
town on the map for the first
time as a convention town and
every citizen should help in the
entertainment of the guests of
the town who will number about
400 people from all parts of the

The frame dwelling of Mrs

rear of The Guardian office was
discovered on fire Monday after
noon about 120 oclock The
alarm was sent in from The
j Guardian office and the fire lad-
dies arrived in a few nioments
land were playing a stream on
the burning building by 130
oclock By 200 oclock the fire
was out but the flames had
gained such headway before the
arrival of the firemen that the
building was completely de
stroyed with all of the house
hold goods and furpiture of Mrs
Albarez
The good work of the firemen
undoubtedly saved the homes of

The Guardian office and the
Chesser House as a high wind
was blowing and the flames from
the burning building had com
municated with the surrounding
fences
Mrs Albarez lost everything
in the fire and was left practi
cally destitute The people here
immediately got out a subscrip
tion list and a nice sum was
raised in a short time which will
help Mrs Albarez to furnish a
new home

Fire Laws Must
Be Observed
TO THE ClTIZENS OF SAFFORD
It became my duty as fire po
lice Monday afternoon to arrest
several parties for blocking the
streets with autos and there
fore interferring with the work
of the firemen also for running
autos over a line of hose laid to
fight the flames
As the firemen are compelled
to go first to the fire and then to
the fire plug or ditch for water
hust the reverse of ordinary fire
fighters as it mav be found that
the water pressure is too light
and then the engine pump can be
connected and the right water
pressure secured I would advise
all who go to fires in the future
to await the action of the fire
men and not block them from
the fire
The law provides penalties for
any car or vehicle to be stopped
within 200 feet of a fire also
provides for a fine for any one
running over the hose when it is
laid at a fire
I ask all citizens to comply
with the law in the future

THE ADAMSOM LAW
Will Be Attacked in the
Courts on Constitu
tional Grounds
Washington Nov 17 Suits
by the railroads attacking the
constitutionality of the Adamson
eight hour law have begun in
many parts of the countrv
No offer has been made bv the
railroads to settle the question
by a test case the Department
oi Justice is preparing to contest
each suit as it comes up
It is claimed that the railroads
will base their suits on the fact
that the law is incapable of en
forcement but the government
expects to assert that congress
has ample power to enact such
legislation
The railroad situation particu
larly the Adamson law will be
discussed from the standpoint of
the countrys business interests
at a special meeting beginning
toaay or tne National Jouncil of
the Chamber of Commerce of the
United States
The question of strike preven
tion and wage fixing for common
carrier employes by the Inter
state Commerce Commission will
be considered
The Department of Justice
yesterday continued preparing
the government defense to the
railroad suits attacking the con
stitutionality of the law and a
probable effort will be made to
take one of the suits to the Su
preme Court quickly to obtain a
final ruling which would be bind
ing upon the lower federal tri
bunals when the law unless en
joined becomes operative on
January 1st
The joint congressional com
mittee appointed to investigate
the railroad institutions will hold

WILL ENFORCE
THE MENT
New Prohibition Law Will
Probably Go Into Effect
December 1st
THE LAW IS VERY DRASTIC
Personal Use Knocked Oat and
Arizona Will Be a Real
Dry State
The new prohibition amend
ment will go into effect as soon
as Governor Hunt issue his pro
clamation of the result of the
recent election which may be
announced before December 1st
Attorney General Wiley E
Jones has sent the following no
tice to all county attorneys
In order to have uniformity
of official action this letter goes
to every county attorney in the
State of Arizona
You are doubtless aware that
the prohibition amendment sub
mitted to the people of Arizona
was overwhelmingly adopted at
the election held on the 7th in
stant and only awaits the pro
clamation of the governor de
claring the result to make it ef
fective
The prohibition amendment
adopted two years ago did not
become effective until January
1st following for the reason that
Section 3 of that amendment
read This amendment shall
take effect on and be in force on
and after the first day of Janu
ary 1915
lhere is no such nrovision in
the new amendment adopted on
the 7th instant and in the ab
sence of such a provision it is a
wen estaonsned rule of law that
the new amendment will take
effect upon the declaratiou of the
result by proclamation- of the
governor
Therefore I suggest that you
give publicity to that fact so far
as possible throughout your
county in order that the public
may be fully informed of the im
mediate operation of the amend
ment and of your duty and mine
to enforce it thereafter
