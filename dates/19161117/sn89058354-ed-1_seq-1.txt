Only 97
John C. Tharpe, Democratic
nominee for representative, led
the ticket in this county in the
election of Tuesday, November
7, receiving a total of 3,186
votes. He was unopposed except
by the Socialist candidate, G. T.
Baldwin. .
uovernor lom u. Kye was
second on the ticket with a total
vote in the county of 3,072, while
wnson ana Aiciieiiar ran very
close together, receiving totals
of 2,988 and 2,938 respectively.
Reynolds, Democratic nominee
for floterial representative, was
not very far behind, receiving a
total of 2,869, and Enloe,' candi
date for Railroad Commissioner,
was close on his heels with a
total of 2,831. Next came Thetus
W. Sims, nominee for Congress,
who totaled 2,719, and last on
the ticket was Tom V. Burton,
the nominee for State Senator.
with a total of 1,874.
The race for the state senator-
ship was one of the closest in this
county for j many years, Burton
receiving only 97 majority oyer
his opponent, W. E. Weldon, who
was running independent. Bur
ton, however, received a sub
stantial majority in Carroll
county. - . "
The Republicans did not poll
the strength that they had hoped
to do in some of the races; in the
congressional race, for instance,
they fell far short of their an
ticipations. Farmers Union votes
for Rhodes and against Sims had
been counted on to defeat the
latter, but it seems that party
loyalty came first with the Henry
county voters. The Farmers
Union strength was far short of
what the Republicans had count
ed on. - ' ' ''

WITH OPENING OF QUAIL
SEASON LAST WEDNESDAYS
At the break of day last Wed
nesday morning Henry county
was "shot up" by numbers of
nimrods who saw the sun rise
for 1 the first time in many
monthsr They were out . bright
and early in order to take ad
vantage of the opening day of
the hunting season in this state.
Quail was the object uppermost
in the minds of the hunters, but
rabbits and squirrels that crossed
the path of the gunmen met
with a sad fate.
It is said that there is more
game this season than there has
been for many, years, and the
season promises to be good for
the hunters.
A number of hunters from the
city reported excellent luck for
days hunt.

GOOD WILL
DEMOCRATS OF COUNTy
IN BIG CELEBRATION
OF ViCTORliOF TICKET
Parade and Speaking Attended
By An Enormous
Crowd -
PROMINENT TENNESSEANS
DELIVER GOOD ADDRESSES
Unfavorable Weather Does Not
Interfere With Making It
A Success
There was a hot time in the old
town Monday night.
With the streets jammed with
an immense throng and a great
parade, the Democracy of Henry
county celebrated the victory of
the ticket in county, state and
nation. The celebration held
here two years ago when Tom C.
Rye was elected governor is the
only jubilee ever held that ap
proached in magnitude the rally
of Monday night.. . .
The finishing touch was added
to the rally when the crowd
packed and jammed the Dixie
Theatre to hear the addresses of
Gov. Rye. Senator J. J. Murray,
Judge Thos. E. Harwood, Gen.
Hillsman Taylor and others.
George L. Fryer, who was 1b
active charge of the Henry coun
ty campaign, acted as master of
ceremonies.
The "noise" for the occasion
was furnished by firecrackers,
whistles, tin pans and Wesley
Guthrie. The celebration besran
just before the arrival of the six
thirty train, which bore some of
the participants in the rally, and
from that time until the hour of
the speaking at the theatre there
was a perfect bedlam of jollifica
tion by the great throng.
The automobile parade formed
at 7 o'clock at the Caldwell hotel
and, headed by a large dray coo
taining a number of citizens and
a Democratic donkey draped in
the national colors, traversed the
principal streets of the city. The
concert band, playing "Comin
Thru the Rye," occupied the
next car, and following were
any number of cars containing
prominent Tennesseans. The
wind, which was almost a gale,
forced the participants in the
parade to abandon the torchlight
procession that had been in
tended.
The outstanding feature of the
parade was a float, on the bow
of which was a game cock, and
occupied by the children of
Cooper Miller. The rooster aa
well as the donkey attended the
speaking at the theatre. ; -
