Confessed to Officer Varney
to Robbing at Least
Two Stores
County Judge liushey yesterday com
mitted Tommy Hickman nud Alton

a result of confesious secured by Offi
cer Vimiey while investigating the
robbery of Shedeek and Brown's store,
which took place Wednesday night and
which Was reported to the police Thurs

Tommy Hickman and Alton. Ilmnnon

robbery when they were seen giving
small gifts to their friends, and when
it was remembered the two boys had
been in the store lute Wednesday night.
They had broken into Farmer's Hard
ware store and had taken two flash
lights. The police believe the appre
hension of Tommy Hickman clears up
numerous robberies that have taken
place the past few weeks, lie is said
to .ie as clever in tins game as a regu
lar professional crook.
Officer Varnev, when assigned to the
case, went out to the Richmond school,
where the boys were attending classes
and called Tommy out. When confront
ed with the nccusntWn of guilt ho de
uied it with a composure that would
have done credit to a hardened crim
inal, so the officer said. Officer var
ney believed the boys were the ones
wanted and called out Brnnnon, aged
13, and asked him where he put the
stuff he, took from Shedock and Hrowns
store. Brnnnon confessed to hiding his
stuff in a barn. After this admission
Hickman confessed and. on proceeding
to tho barn, they found the stuff, in
cluding two flashlights and pocket
knives taken from Farmer's hardware
store.
Officer Varney then took the boys to
the police, station where Chief Welsh
continued the' investigation and de
cided to turn them over to Judge
Ituslioy.

I. os Angeles, Cal., Nov. 17. A differ
ence of three votes in I.os Angeles
county precinct Ho. 338 may hold up
the ortiiial count in this county -in
definitely. Tf the presidential election
must depend on the Culifornia vote,
supremo court action may be necessary.
This was the opinion expressed by-re
publican and democratic leaders watch
ing the count.
Tally sheets in' precinct No- 338 show
ed that i7.'I votes had been cast for
presidential electors while only 270
votes had been registered. Election of
ficials of that precinct are at a loss to
explain. County Counsel Hill was expect
ed to render an opinion today, but he
admitted he could 'find no precedent. Un
til this difficulty is settied the official
count cannot proceed, supervisors have
ruled.
The board of supervisors, which is
making the official count of f.os Ange
les county returns apparently fears to
make any announcement regarding the
standing' of the count since tho official
tally began, until the precinct No. 338
matter is disposed of. Members of the
board pointed out that any definite ac
tion taken by tlim ivay result in ?ong
drawn out court aotion.to determine the
status -of the county vote, thug delay
ing the result of the national election
indefinitely.
The democratic party, through Attor
neys Milton K. Young and George Denis
agreed to surrender as many vi llson
votes in the precinct as supervisors
deemed necessary to correct tho error,
They stated they were willing to sur
render the entire 15 majority for Wil
son in the precinct, rather than have
the precinct thrown out and the- 270
voters disfranchised. A. M. Dunn, rep
resenting the republican party was not
willing to accept this proposition hold
ing that the procinct should either be
thrown out or steps taken toward a re
count.
W1U Not Act Until Monday.
I.os Angeles, Cat, Nov. 17. The na
tion will not know how California voted
in the presidential election until Mon
day at least and possibly not until some
time later than that. This delay was
caused over the I.os Angeles county
board of supervisors failurs to reach a
solution of the "precinct No. 338 diffi
culty" in which three votes are involv

The board voted to take the matter
under advisement until Monday morning
at 10 o'clock. No figures on the of
ficial count of I.os Angeles county, up
on which politicians say a big Hughes

stated.
Many here believe the strange
craft .wa.i the war submarine
which had been expected as a

was argued here that inasmuch

London, Nov. 17. Fall of Monastir
within three duvs was confidently pre
dicted hero today with receipt of fresh
news of tho victorious progress toward
tho Macedonian citv of French, Italian,
Russian nnd Serbian forces. Fighting
through snow, sleet and mud Nie four
allies have impetuously swung twice in
flanking movements of gigantic magni
tude and haye a vise-like grip on the
Monastir neighborhood.
General Serratl refused to be drawn
into attacking the Bulgarian defenses to
the south of Monastir defenses which
Sofia some time ago pronounced im
pregnable and according to all reports
which reach here has forced retirement
of the Bulgarian-Teuton defenders from
these positions without their hardly
striking a blow, by threat of strong en
veloping movement.
Fall of Monastir will be a distinct
blow at Bulgarian pride and experts
here predicted another appeal from
Sofia for German assistance in retakine
the city. Its natural importance is not
great, but Bulgaria apparently attaches
sentimental value to holding of the city.
J3no immediate effect of the allied ad-
vanrV it was expected Jiere, would be
relief from General Von. Fhlkenhayn 'b
forward fovemcnt into Rumania. Mili
tary observers believe somo of his
forces will be diverted to render assist
ance to tho retreating Bulgarians north
of Monastir. Just now Rumania is feel
ing the effect of this strong movement
southward of the Teutonic forces, Von
Falkenhayn having crossed the Carpa
thoans and advanced a score or more of
miles across -the frontier, occupying a
oosition where he now threatens a
flanking movement of the Rumanian
line on the Danube.
Considerable activity, coincident with
the Monastir advance, is also reported
from tho British force operating to the
east of tho Struma river, this army
has also made distinct advances.
Serbians Still Advance.

TO RJIS ANO SAMOA
Cannibals Will Bite Off a
Mouthful If They Tackle
the Colonel
By J. P. Toder.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
New York, Nov. 17. Although the
Fijis and fhe Polynesians of Samoa
don't know it yot, their respective is
lands are due for a tilt, and the South
Pacific for somewhat of a splash, so
to speak, next February. Because T.
K- is going to visit 'em.
It is understood this trip is to con
stitute Colonel Roosevelt 'a vucation aft
er tho campaign labors he undertook I
in tho interests of Charles I.. Hughes.
Mrs. Roosovelt will accompany the col
onel.
Roosevelt' chose Samoa and the Fiji
islands because they aro both highly
spoken of by physicians as above the
averago in climate and, too, because
Roosevelt believes they will afford bint
a good playground for the rather ard
uous vacation he generally takes. -
Although Wesloyan missionaries have
driven sin and cannibalistic traits from
the erstwhile savage, Fijis and the en
ergy they -onco speul .in--, thinking up
untquo tortures lor nntortunate vic
tim has been turned to more civilized
channels, thero remain many distract-
tions on the islands. Mr. Lippincott's
gabettcr mentions innumerable worn-
out volcanoes to crawl about in And
many health-springs with such modern
conveniences as hot and cold water de
vices. Thero aro several five-thousand foot
hills in (-Samoa and a lot of wild ter
ritory in which any number of heretofore-
undiscovered wild things aro said
to abound, unnamed.
The colonel plans to start about Feb
ruary 1. He hasn't decided yet wheth
er to go through tho Panama canal or
across the continent to San Francisco
for his boat. He will be gone probnbly
two months.
It is most unlikely that Roosevelt will
mnko any political announcements or
speeches until nfter his return.
Hughes' Lead Is Cut
Steadily by Count
in Eastern Oregon
Portland, Ore.,. Nov. 17 The plurality
by which Hughes carried Oregon has
been reduced steadily as complete re
turns have come in from tho counties
east of the mountains. Malheur is now
the only county iu tho stnto which has
not sent in complete figures and the to
tals are now es follows: Hughes, 125,
381; Wilson, 118,827; Hughes' plural
if, fi,557. These totals include about
three-fourths of the vote cast in Mal
heur. Tho complete returns from Mal
heur will probably make a farther slight
reduction in Hughes' lead.
Tho returns now' at hand show that
eastern Oregon gave Wilson a plurality
of 0,023. Hood River and Morrow were
the only counties east of the mountains
that gave pluralities for Hughes.

law controversy was given today by
President Charles R. VanHiso of Wis
consin university to thu national coun
cil of the United .States chamber ef
commerce.
Hbould the courts grant tho appeal of
railroads to enjoin enforcement f the
Adamson eight-hour law, tho work of
the commission appointed to investigate
its application to railroad operations
will be held up temporarily, General
Uoethals, chairman ot the investigating
commission, snid today. Ooothuls left
here this afternoon for New York,
where ho will meet with the other mem
bers of the commission next Thursday.
The work of the investigators up to
January 1, when the law is designed
to go into effect, will be Informal. Fvl
lowing that date its action will be gov
erned by the decision of the courts iu

A new angle in the fight of the rail
roads was presented to department ef
justico officials today when it was
learned that iu suits filed at Milwaukee,
plea is made to enjoin railroad employes
irom cuiLecimg wages uiiuer lav imw.
The pending litigation was made the
object of discussion today at a special
meeting of the I'nitcd Htates chamber
of commerce. The executive eouneii or
the chamber urged "an immediate in-,
vestigation by the interstate commerce
commission ot all facts relevant to the
present railroad controversy."
No Holdup Permissible.

"Tho railroad brotherhoods must not
bo permitted to hold up the people ef
th United Htates and at the point of a
pistol demand ' we must receive wkat
we want, or one hundred million people
will be subjected to enormous losses and
suffering."
Vanllise snid regulutiou of wages by
the government is inevitable. The first
thing that must come is an amendment

"The commerce clause of the consti

Adamson said. "Congress passed first
