A complete and happy surprise 1

after which the ladies took posession
of the kitchen and dining room, and
soon a bounteous supply of delicious

event was enjoyed until a late hou",
When the good nights were said. It

COUNTY CI TEST-
b
Organized in the Office of
County Agent Last
Wednesday.
Organization and System is the
success of business. All branches of
farm enterprise, which formerly was
j lun in an' 0,(1 "Hit aml Miss" manner
is a11 fast becoming an organized
I science. County Farm Agent, T. A.
Parrand, is largely reponsible for this
improved condition in Van Buren
county.
The latest organization for the bene
tit of the farmer, is what is known as
the Van Buren county Cow Testing
association, which was organized in
the office of Mr. Farrand last Wed
nesday. Following are the officers of
the new organization:
President, L L Lawrence, Decatur;
Vice President, Ralph Sherman, South

HIGH HONOR GOMES
TO PAW PAW WOMAN
Mrs. Olivia J. C. Woodman of Paw
I paw is the recipient of an honor that
I comes to but few. She has been call
ed to Washington. I). C. to make the
response n oenau ol the .National
Grange to the address of welcome
given by Woodrow W ilson, president
of the United States. She left for
the Capitol city on Tuesday. Mrs.
Woodman is one of the countries most
gifted women. Her selection to make j
such an address in this great National
Organization is a high tribute to her
ability and standing, and one which1
she richly merits. The honor is not
only pleasing to Mrs. Woodman, but
, is mighty gratifying to her friends in
j her county ami state. We join in

BILLU BURKE IS POPULAR.
The idle Hour Theatre was crowded
to capacity last Tuesday night for the
first of the Billie Burke feature. This

6 ASSOCIATION
HUNTERS ARE NOW
CAMPED IN NORTH
Last Party Left Paw Paw on
Tuesday of This Week
For Northern Camp
NINETY LICENSES IN COUNTY
Twelve More than Last Year
Call of the North
is Strong.
The last of the deer hunters are
probably now in camp in the northern
woods. Germain Prater, Delos Mitch
elson, Alphonso Cross and son, and
Fred Cornell were the last to go from
Paw Paw, leaving Tuesday morning.
The snow storm early in the week
helped to hasten the stragglers, for if
there is anything that a deer hunter
likes to see, it is a nice fall of snow.
There have been a total of ninety
deer hunters license issued from the
clerk's office this season. This is
twelve more than were issued last
year, when there was a great falling
off owing no doubt to the fact that
the law was changed permitting only
one deer to each hunter instead of two
was quite a common thing to issue in
a formerly. Several years ago it
the neighborhood of one hundred and
SOVenty-ftvs licenses. In former
years several licenses have been is
sued to ladies, but this year the fair
sex will remain at home by the fire
side. The cost of a deer hunters
license is $1.50. One dollar of this
amount goes to the state, 25 cents to
the county and J5 cents to the clerk.
In addition to the deer hunters
license, there have been approximate
ly fifteen hundred resident gun
licenses issued in the county, and one
non-resident license. The cost of a
resident gun license is $1.00. Ninety
cents of this amount goes to the state
and ten cents to the county. The fee
for a non-resident license is $10.00.
Several county licenses have been is
sued to ladies.
To one who has ever been deer
hunting, the call of the north is strong
and the hunter no sooner gets home
from one trip, before he commences
to plan for the next season's outing.
Besides the anticipation of the next
year's sport, the tales of the chase,
and the big one that w;is wounded
and got away, furnishes enjoyment
around the fireside during the long
j winter evenings.
VAN BUREN NOT HIT
BY THE LAND SLIDE
The vote in Van Buren county was
, most satisfactory from B republican
, standpoint, when compared with some
Of our neighboring counties. Hughes
and Sleeper carried the county by well
over a thousand, while the county
ticket was elected by majorities
aroundfltysen hundred. George Dill
enbeck for road commissioner had the
closest call, winning by the small mar
gin of two hundred. Mr. Waber his
opponent, made a vigorous campaign
and this with his personality, and the
fact that he is one of the best road
men in the country, came very near
electing him.
SENTENCED TO JACKSON.
Undersheriff Andrew Lang went to
