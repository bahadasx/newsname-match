ESTABLISHED 1845.
4 MORE YEARS
OF PROSPERITY
Wilson's Majority in Electoral
College Safe, and Republicans
Will Be Kept Away From
Pie Counter For At Least
Four Years Longer.
Unofficial returns compiled by the
Democratic National Committee indi?
cate that President Wilson will have
when the official count is in, 272- elec?
toral votes sure, and that his elec?
tion, therefore, is an assured fact.
Judge Hughes, however, has not con?
ceded Mr. Wilson's election, but is
only waiting for the returns to be
completed in California. Republican
National chairman Willcox is holding
on like grim death to the faint hope
that irregularities will be discovered
in California, but the Democrats as?
sert that the re-count now in progress
in that State will give Wilson a furth?
er advantage.
There is little hope, in fnct, none,
for our Republican friends in Taze
well, who have money on the election
of Hughes, or who have their eyes
on any of the post office jobs in the
county. There's nothing elso left but I
to stand it for four more years. j
PRESIDENT WILL TAKE OATH OF I
OFFICE SUNDAY.
Washington, Nov. 15.?There will
be no lapsj in the service of Presi?
dent Wilson because of the fact that
March 4, next, inauguration day,
s on Sunda". according to an
opinion reached at the State depart?
ment. While it is not expected that
the formal inauguration of Mr.
Wilson will be held until Monday
March 5, he will be advised by Sec?
retary Lansing to take the oath of
office Sunday.
If Charles E. Hughes concedes
the re-election of President Wilson
by next Friday, Vance C. McCor
mick, chairman of the Democratic
national committee, probably will
discuss plans for the president's in?
auguration with local Democratic
leaders when he comes to Washing?
ton that day.
EUROPE CONGRATULATES WIL?
SON; HUGHES SILENT.
Washington, Nov. 14.?Congratula?
tions on his re-election have been re?
ceived by President Wilson from rul?
ers of several foreign nations, but
their names will not be given out un?
til after Mr. Hughes' concedes Mr.
Wilson's re-election.
Five hundred voices, backed by the
music of ten brass bands, will sere?
nade the President from the grounds
in front of tho White House Thurs?
day evening. Loath to take any ac?
tive part in the demonstration, for the
reasons that the occasion might be
misconstrued as a political one and
that Mr. Hughes has not yet con?
ceded his defeat, the President prob?
ably will not review the parade
which will precede the singing at the
White House.
CALIFORNIA RETURNS.
San Francisco, Cal., Nov. 14.?
Whether the highets vote for a Re?
publican elector in California was
greater than tho lowest vote for n
Democratic elector wns about the only
question of interest to California pol?
iticians tonight. If this should prove
to be the case the State's delega?
tion in the electoral college may be
split. The Republicans admittedly
unearthed nothing in the course of the
day to indicate for or against such
a prospect.
Sidney M. Van Wyck, Jr., Demo?
cratic chairman, worked all day
bringin in reports from little coun?
ties in the mountains where the
county clerks had finished their count
and also succeeded in getting one or
two fair sized counties. His total for
twenty counties showed that the tot?
als for the lowest Democratic elector
in each county added 6,466 votes more
than the totals for the highest Re?
publican elector in the same coun?
ties. If the lowest Democratic totals
are finally ahead of tho highest Re?
publican totals a solid delegation in
the electoral college is assured. If
the highest Republican totals exceed
the lowest Democratic totals this will
Republican elector wins, because the
lowest Democrat and the highest Re?
publican aro not the same in all the
counties.
Republicans and Democrats alike
manifest surprise at rumors, trace?
able in all -cases to the East that a
considerable error had been found
bi hte votes.
"This mistake ns reported would
have to be in San Francisco. Alame
da or Los Angeles county," said Mr.
Van Wyck, "It is none of them, and
so far as we have been able to learn
it does not exist. The final count will
show no material change."
Reports from Republican head?
quarters were similar.
REPUBLICANS SHOW WILSON'S
BIG VOTE.
A study of the unofficial figures of
the election from various States, be?
gun Wednesday nt the Republican
National headquarters in New York,
and brought out impressively the ex?
tent of the vote which President Wil?
son received. The unofficial figures
for President have been completed
from all the States, and they show
that, compared with the vote for Wil?
son, Toft and Roosevelt in 1912, there
was an increase for Wilson and
Hughes this year of 2,830,000 over
the total Democratic, Republican and
Progressive vote four years ago. Of
this President Wilson is shown to
have received 2,266,000 and Mr.
Hughes, 564,000.
In nearly every big state it is shown
that Mr. Wilson made a great gain
over his vote of four years ago, while
in several Stetes the total of Mr.
Hughes falls below tho combined
vote of Roosevelt and Taft in 1912.
Stutos in which both Mr. Wilson
and Hughes gained in the total vote,
(the Hughes vote being compared
with the combined Roosevelt-Taft
vote in 1912), with the gain of each
candidate at the recent election are
here given:
States W. gain H. gain
New York, .101,000 18,000
New Jersey. 31,000 30,000
Arizona. 10,000 10,000
California, .188,000 106,000
Connecticut, . 25,000 4,000
Illinois, .465,000 404,000
Indiana.171,000 82,000
In Colorado Wilson gained 44,000
and Hughes lost 34,000; In Idaho Wil?
son gained 34,000 and Hughes lost
4,000; in Iowa Wilson went ahead
30,000 and Hughes fell off 2,000; in
Maine Wilson's gain was 13,000 and
Ilughes's loss 6,000; in Massachu
settcs Wilson gained 73 000 and Mr.
Hughes fell 83.000 below, the Tnft
Roosevclt total; in Pennsylvania, Wil?
son went ahead 115,000 and Hughes
fell 25,000 behind; in Ohio Wilson
gained 155.000 and Hughos lost 10,
000; in Minnesota Wilson trained 70,
000 and Hughes lost 13,000.
The total vote this year, accord?
ing to the unofficial returns, was
16,724,114.
MAKE THE POSTMASTERS "COME
ACROSS."
Mr. W. W. Marsh, Treasurer of the
Democratic National Committee, is?
sues a statement that there is a de?
ficit in the campaign fund of "over
three hundred thousand dollars," and
urges a general public collection to
raise this amount and "wipe out the
deficit."
There are about 800,000 postmas?
ters in Uncle Sam's employe. One
dollar from each one of these would
turn the trick and nobody feel hurt.
The Republicans would raise this
amount and more if necessary, fron?
this one source. If each postmaster
were asked to come across with his
dollar, he'd come. Why not?

THE TRAGIC DEATH OF TOUNG
McGINNIS.
The visit to this office lost week of
Misses McGinnis, of Burke's Garden,
recalled the tragic death of their
brother, a boy about 16 years old,
the only boy in the family, which
occurred about five years ago, caused
by a fall from an apple tree.
With his Bister, he had gone to an
orchard to gather apples. The boy
climbed on apple tree, and the limb
on which he stood, broke under his
weight, precipitating him to the
ground, a distance of about 16 feet.
He fell on his head, breaking his
neck. He lived only a short time, and
was taken home a corpse. The sad
event cast a gloom over the com?
munity at the time. The wounds
made in the hearts of the family have
never been healed.
RAILROAD TERMINUS AT NORTH
TAZEWELL.
Mr. Staples, the engineer in charge
of the Clear Fork railroad survey,
was here on Wednesday, and stated
to a representative of this paper, that
the survey had been about complet?
ed, and that tho terminus of this
first survey would be at North Taze?
well, about 1000 feet oust of the pr?s?
ent station.
While the surveys mads are only
preliminary, and may be therefore,
I changed in some particulars, there
seems to be litle doubt, in any event,
that the terminus of the road will be
at North Tazewell, and not at Burke's
Garden siding, as was at ono time
thought probable by many people.
This will cause the little bumptuous
city of North Tazewell to put on
another air or two.
Hurrah for North Tazewell!

HOW THE RURAL CREDITS LAW
HELPS TENANTS.
IL has been frequently said that the
now rural credits law does nothing to
help the renter become n home-owner
but a little reflection will show that
it does a great deal. If a renter
has one-half the money he needs to
buy nny piece of land, any national
farm loan association will lend him
the other half at a low rate of inter?
est and give him from five to forty
years' time to pay it back.
This will certainly be n help to
those renters who hnve heretofore
been offered land only on condition
that they pay the whole amount in
three, five or ten years.
Renters who wish to become land?
owners will do well to keep this op?
portunity in mind, as it will be in
real operation in a few months now.

THE SPIDER AND ITS WEB.
Somo weeks before tho election wo
published an account of the discovery
of a snider web by a young lady of
North Tazewell, which spider web
contained the wordn Wilson plainly
woven in the center. At the same
time it was stated that the young
lady who discovered the web was u
Republican. Her friends of that po?
litical persuasion made much fun of
the alleged discovery, among them
being Dr. Wnlter Witten, who said
that even if the discovery wns made,
it did not mean anything, but on
Wednesday morning after election
when the West was heard from Dr.
Witten changed his mind, and has be?
come a firm beliover in cob webs, not?
withstanding tho fact that if you hap?
pen to get one fastened in your throat
it will have to stay there unless wa?
ter will wnsh it out. The spider that
wcaved that web on Stony Ridge
knew who kept us out of wnr. No
doubt that same old spider remem?
bers as fur back as 1907 when n heavy
coal train passing North Tazewell was
a curiosity.
R. M. LAWSON ON THE PURE?
BRED STOCK ASSOCIATION.
Mr. R. M. Lawson, of Burke's Gnr
?den, one of the lending breeders of
Shorthorns in tho county, speaks well
, of the efforts of Mr. Wall to organize
;i pure-bred shorthorn association in
the county.
"Mr. Wall is trying to organize a
"good stock" association in Tazewell
with the particular object of extend?
ing the use of pure-bred "Shorthorn
Sires" as nearly as possible to ev?
ery community in tho county.
Tho importance of widening the
usefulness of pure-bred sires to tho
borders of the grazing country of
Virginin has long been recognized
The pure-bred sire is the vital, fun?
damental, indispcnsible fnct.
"No doubt we should find greater
pleasure and more profit in fewor,
better bred and better fed miimnls
than in grent numbers of an inferior
kind. The margin in market sales
is something in excess of 6c per
pound between the commonest nnd
prime beef cattle, is tho argument
unanswerable for quality product.
"I beg to suggest a canvas of tho
county to see where bulls will bo
kept at suitable centers for com?
munity service. It is not my opinion
thnt either tho distribution of the
people or tho topography of our ter?
ritory amount to an insuperable bar
to tno plnn already in use in Leo,
Washington, Rusaell counties. If the
cows be halter broken to load then
three miles would covor a circum
ferance of eighteen miles around nnd
this is easily within the power ol
,nny who is sure he will be paid for
the use of his time.
"It's a step in the right direction;
others should follow. Try it out, ii
you are behind it success is assured.'

A HISTORIC SPOT.

Editor tho Clinch Valley News:
I have promised you to write some?
thing about this magnificent country.
I am now on the historic spot, where
the first development was made, and
where it stands today a monument,
lo man's genius and enterprise. 1
am at Pocahontas, in a magnificent
hotel kept by the daughter of my old
friend, Grat Crockelt, the friend of
tny earlier days. You cannot stop
into n hotel in New York nnd beat it.
But I am on historic ground. It
stands like The Boncon of tho Ages,
Lighting the Pathway to Better
Things.
It stands here conscious of its su?
periority, conscious of the fnct that
it pointed the genius of man to this
developmont nnd that there is grca
er things to come. With its magnifi?
cent people nothing is impossible.
They left out of their dictionary the
word "fail." With a cou-age born
of disaster, they rise liko tho Phoe?
nix from tho ashes of defeat and
ook to a brighter morn. ,
They ore unconquerable, with a
hope tnnt they may see better things.
They strive ever onward and up?
ward, other towns mny Boring up,
but like Tennyson's brook they go on
forever.
They shine liko enrols rrravo by grave
And even strength they borrow,
And where the vanguard rests today,
The rear shall camp tomorrow.

REV. R. K. SUTHERLAND DEAD.
Well Known Minister Succombs to
Bright'* Disease.
A message received hero yostbrday
morning brought tlie allocking intelli?
gence that Row R. K. Sutherland
was dead. The sad event occurred at
his home at Emory early yesterday
morning, and was due, as was learn?
ed here, to Uright's Disease. Ho was
about -16 years of ago and leaves a
widow and four children. At the
lime of his death he was treasurer of
Emory and Henry College, and taught
a class also in the school. Kor u
number of years he was financial
agent of the college, in which capaci?
ty he raised and expended a large
aim of money for the erection of new
buildings, etc., at Emory ami Hen?
ry. For four years he was on the
West Tazewell circuit, during which
time he met and married Miss Aman?
da Burns, daughter of the late Oscar
Barns of the Cove, one of Tuzcwel's
best nnd most prominent young wo
nen. For a while Mr. Sutherland re
sided nt Liberty, while (ho circuit
pnrsonngo in this town was being
erected, which was done through his
?ffuiis. After its completion ho mov
d into the new building, where he re
tided until being rtnnsferred.
Mr. Sutherland was recognized as
? no of the prominent ministers of the
lolslon conference, and his talents
.ml accomplishments gave promise of
till groator usefulness. His widow
i ml her children have the sympathy
? f the large famllv connection in this
utility, and n still wider circle of
friends here and elsewhere.
TRAGIC DEATH OF MISS ELLETT
Mrs. Marlin, wife of Prof. J, II.
Martin, spent Inst Saturday and Sun?
day with her friend, Mrs. E. J. Ellett,
in Pocahontas, who hits recently pass?
ed through a irront nflliction in tho
tragic death of a young daughter, mi
account of which nppeured in the las)
tsBua of ibis paper. Tho mystery
surrounding I he death of this beauti?
ful young girl bus boon partially
at least cleared away. Mr. Frnr.lor,
partner of E. .1. Ellett, father of the
dead girl, went to Kenbridgo, the
.scene ami place whoro the death oc?
curred and made n I borough exami?
nation und obtained nil the facts poa
siblo. It was u clear cane of suicide,
superinduced, as is BU""oaod by sud?
den liberation of mi lid. Kenbridge
is tin isolated village, fur from the
railroad. The young duly WHS leach?
ing there, and not. very comfortably
surrounded. She has never been sep?
arated from her twin sister n day in
her life before this, and brooded over
the situation. On the fnlul morninp,
she secured a nislol belonging to tin
oily of old people with whom she
boarded, nnd lifter breakfast wen!
into Ihe back yard where her body
was found n few momonlH later. Life
was extinct. She wun only about 17
years old. There were no (roubles Oi
nny kind, whatsoever, sn<'s Mr. Frn
v.ier. Something snapped under ten?
sion in the young girl's brain und so
it ended, one of the saddest of trage?
dies.
BUY A CA it FOR THE CIRCUIT.
The writer of these lines suggest?
ed sometime ago that Rev. W. (',.
Thompson, the ubiquitous and ener?
getic "Circuit Rider," should have a
car in which to make bin wide field,
lie has a laborious work, and here?
tofore has had lo go horseback. Last
year Mr. Henry I'eery donated a sad?
dle horse, free of charge. The proncll
or's Hillary is not sufficiently remun?
erative to permit buying and feeding
a horse, or buying a car. The BUg
geslion made to purchase a car for
the circuit, to bo kept for lb" use of
the circuit has met with favor gen?
erally. Many of Mr. Thompson's ad?
mirers ami well-wishers are rich men,
any one of whom could give a car
themselves and "not feel it" day ?f?
ter tomorrow. But, belter (ban this,
give everybody an opportunity (o do a
good deed. A small amount from
Ihe many is preferable to the large
amounts from (he few. Whut say you,
boys? Let's chip in. It is under?
stood that the suggestion hau the ap?
proval of Mr. Thompson's official
members. If this suggestion meets
your approval drop this office n card
saying ho. Better still, send your
check, which will be promptly ac?
knowledged through tho paper, and
turned over to the proper authori?
ties. "Come across" if you approve.

sion here on November 20 for the
purpose of amending certain laws bo
as to affect the tenure of elective and
appointive officers, to curtail the ap?
pointive powers of the governor and
to make the public service commis?
sion and the State board of control
non-partisan, or bi-parlisan, if the
cgislaluru so sees lit.

THE FREE-FOR-ALL FIGHT.
Squiro E. P. Moore, presided at
the trial of the Hoops' Puckott,
Phillips case at the Courthouso on
last btlluday, involving a free-for-all
light on Fail's Branch the week be?
fore, in which suven or eight persons
?vero hiidl- bruised or wounded.
It Boome two of the Puckett boys
ircosptlftscd on the lands of Frank
Phillips by hunting and by attempt?
ing to cut. down a tree on
the Phillips land in order to get a
coon, when Phillips appeared and
ordered I hem away. Phillips had a
oKspnHa warrant issued against the
Pucketl boys and on trial on Oct
lober lilh tlie case was compromised,
und while the case was being settled
II dispute arose between Henry Phil?
lips and William Hoops us to an al?
leged trespass bv William Hoops on
tho Phillips lan.I on u previous oc?
casion during which dispute over tho
old trespass the Iii1 was passed and
Henry Phillips and Will Hoops be?
came engaged in nn altercation, Ru
laliven of each were there in force
ind when the first lick was struck,
here was a rush from both aides and
a free fur all light was on with at.
least liftoon participating with an
nuny more WO)lld-hc ponce makers.
The battle line eventually extended up
and down the Creek for a distance of
at. lonsl one hundred yards. When
it would he slopped at one point It
would break out. afresh at another
point. When the final bout was end?
ed several were lying on tho
ground, one wilh his skull cracked
in three places, one with a
broken jaw, several with cuts and
wounds mid bruises.
For a few days ufter the light there
was considerable feeling in the hos?
tile camps, and when the case eamo
an for trial before Squire E, P. Mooro
he had two sheriffs nl the front door
nf the Courthouse who searched every
person entering, in order to take no
chances of the old trouble re-cur
ring. The court examined all of the
disinterested witnesses, about, ten or
twelve in number, and found their evi?
dence more or less conflicting. Some
said Hciirv Phillips culled Will Hoops
a liar and struck the first lick, while
others said that Will Hoops called
Phillips a liar and struck the first
lick; while others said Hoops never
struck Phillips at all. Aftor hearing
the evidence the court reached the,
conclusion that tho fight was not
premeditated, but arose unexpectedly
and it was cliffcult to traeo what
part each took in the fight, and se?
parate what was self defence from
what was aggression. Under nil of
the circumstances the court reached
(he conclusion that neither siilo was
free from fault and assessed each
aide with a lino of forty dollars and
costs, on the theory that tho rela?
tives should have acted as peace mnk
ors instead of adding fuel to the
flame.
Both sides wero represented by
an array of counsel, while the At?
torney for the Commonwealth ropro
scntud tho Commonwealth's inter?
