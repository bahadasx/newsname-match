HARVARD BIG MARGIN
', As we recall tho figures, in

! score 112 points to Yale's 5
i the scores being 20 lo 0, 15 to B.
36 to 0, unci 41 to 0. In the
siime four years Harvard 1ms
scored less than 00 against
Princeton, yet Yale has had all
the better of Princeton in the
four Tiger-Bulldog contests.
Yale has played her poorest
games against Harvard, und
Princeton has done her worst
playing against Yale. Part of
tills has undoubtedly been due
to the fact that Princeton had
to meet Yale immediately after
the Harvard game, while Yale
had to meet Harvard immediate
ly after tho Princeton game.
That one Saturday rest for Har

but not enough to lake anything

Average Spectator Has No Idea of
Equipment Necessary for Big
Squad of Varsity Men.
The average football spectator has
little idea of the equipment necessary
for a big varsity football squad of 40
men. Manager Lovett of the Penn
eleven has figured out that It costs
approximately $52.55 per player before
the kickoff occurs In the first game of
the season.
Football Is more expensive thnn a
private yacht or a polo string, and it
would stagger the average man to
lenrn that 700 pairs of shoes and
stockings of the most expensive sort,
sweaters, Jerseys, moleskins, to say
nothing of several hundred footballs,
are required in equipping a big team.
Add to that the fact that several men
have been busy all summer rolling the
gridiron, raking It for small stones,
rebeddlng It with fresh sod, and get
ting the field In general Into first-class
condition for the opening.
The upkeep continues throughout
the entire football season, and if foot
ball players drew the salaries that the
diamond stars In the big leagues re
ceive, there would be no football.

With Men Has Helped Game
Sousa Expresses Opinion.
John Philip Sousa, the band lender,
i H ri enthusiastic trap shooter. When
Ids opinion on women taklpg up
ttie sport, he said:
Women are finding trap shooting
. n oore enjoyable than golf, tennis
iiiui the other games they now play.
In the shotgun gome she is sot classi
fied a woman. She is not segre
gated from the men. She meets men
sh . . s on an equul footing, and there
is o'liidng that pleases her more thnn
to i her lord and master at his own
Mine. Indeed, women hnve so far ad
vance I In trap shooting that they will
)K permitted to enter the Grand Amer
ican bundlcap this year.
"Shooting makes a woman agile and
nlert. I have shot nt the traps with
many womeu, and never have 1 seen
an ungraceful one who used a shotgun
well."
INDIANA GETS HANNY
Athlete Was Sought by Many
Leading Universities.
Aurora Youth Has Played High-School
Football for Three Years Future
Ail-American End, Says
New York Papers.
Then' is perhaps no young man in
the United States of greater promise
as an athlete than Frank II. Unnny of
Aurora, 111., who has entered Indiana
university. Many of the lending uni
versities of the country sought Hanny,
and for n long time ho was undecid
ed as to where he would attend, but
finally decided to go lo Indiana.
Hanny has played high-school foot
ball for three years, the first year at
fullback and tho last two at end, whero
he was a wonder. He Is very fast on
his feet, a splendid kicker nnd a wiz
ard at diagnosing and breaking up
plays.
The Aurora high school played the
Hamilton Institute of Brooklyn, X. Y.,
nt Brooklyn, and Hnnny's wonderful
playing brought forth great praise
from the sporting writers of all tho
Now York city newspapers. Many
of the sport critics- predict tliat ho
would make the All-American team,
should he go u college, while all of
thorn stated that his playing was the
feature of the game.
The New York Times said: "One of
the features of the game was the kick
ing of Hanny, Aurora right end. whose
punts average more than DO yards.

The New York Tribune nnd this to
say : "Hanny, the Aurora end, Is a pos
sible All-American man of the fu
ture. He can tackle, Is clever nt di
agnosing plays and one of the great
est players ever seen on on eastern
gridiron."
Hnnny Is only eighteen years old.
weighs 190 pounds and is six feet tall.
He graduated from the Aurora high
school last June and is an excellent
student.
FOOTBALL IS ACADEMIC GAME
Schools and Colleges Relied on to
Maintain High Standards of Sports
manship in It Play.
According to the football rules hook,
football, both In piny and by tradition,
is distinctively an academic game the
game of schools and colleges. The
friends of the game must accordingly
rely on the schools and colleges for
the preservation of Its past traditions
and the maintenance of the high stand
ards of sportsmanship In its play which
are to be expected in a dlstiactlvely
academic game.
In some sports, it is possible to at
tain reasonable high standards simply
by the adoption nnd enforcement of
rules, but this Is not true in football.
There are so many players engaged
In action, and the action is so rapid
and constantly shifting that It is im
possible for any official to discover ev
ery possible Infraction of the rules. Be
cuuse of this fact and with the inten
tion of upholding the standards of the
game, the committee on rules has
adopted the following :
"The football pluyer who lutentlon
ally violates a rule is guilty of unfair
play and unsportsmanlike tactics, and
whether or not he escapes being pen
alized, he brings discredit to the good
name of the game which it Is his duty
to uphold,"
Basketball Rules to Hold.
There will be no radical changes In
tho basketball rules for the present
season, as a result of the Joint com
mittee meeting of the Amateur Ath
letic union. Young Men's Christian as
sociation, and Nntlonnl Collegiate Ath
letic association, which decided that
the regulations need nu Important
changes.
BUILD A SUBWAY
TO VERDUN FRONT
Tunnel, 45 Feet Underground,
Leads to Within 300 Yards
of Germans.
AMERICANS MAKE THE TRIP
New York Lawyer Narrowly Escapes
Shots as He Views Trenches
Tunnel Cook Was Formerly
Chef to an Ambassador.
Verdun. Just west of here, in the
forest of Argonne, there is a remark
able military tunnel, 45 feet under
ground, running right up to within
300 yards of the Uermun trenches.
It is one of tho most hard-pressed
points around Verdun, but through this
tunnel re-enforcements move forward
without danger, relieving every two
hours the men on the firing line.
There was a very American atmos
phere about this tunnel when the writ
er visited it, for the curious fact de
veloped tlmthe two officers in coin
aiund were American residents, one a
Stock raiser in Alberta, Canada, and
the other a bank otliciul of the Franco
American bank at Los Angeles, Cal.
Both were born in France, and when
the war broke out left their American
businesses to come home and fight. And
now they are in full charge of tills un
derground highway, leading up to one
of the most desperate positions along
the front. They are so American that
they speak English instead of French,
and the commandant's headquarters
a little nest In the clay has a big
picture of Uncle Sam hanging on the
wall.
Creeping tli rough this tunnel to
ward the front line, tho members of
the visiting party knocked their steel
casques ou the roof, and plunged
through water ankle deep. Paul D.
Cravnth, the New York lawyer, a man
of large build, 0 feet 6 inches tall,
was beat double In the struggle through
tiie tunnel. Along the way they passed
an electric plant, throbbing with en
ergy, nnd pumping the fresh air which
keeps the tunnel habitable. Farther
on, In n large clay hole, a kitchen
was In full operation, with soldiers eat
ing bowls of noodles.
Chef to an Ambassador.
"Let me introduce you to our chef,"
said the commandant, as a young sol
dier cook came forwurd. "He Is now
the cook for this tunuel and he ought
to be a good cook, for before the war
he was chef to the French ambassador
at Kome."
Emerging from the tunnel into the
front line, the German trenches were
plainly visible on the crest only 300
yards away. The intervening space
was swept clear us though by a cy
clone. Instead of the beautiful green
of the forest, thut wus left at the other
end of the tuunel, here the whole out
look was gruy nnd desolate; the
ground Jagged and torn as by eccentric
plows, not a vestige of grass or
verdure, and the few gaunt trunks of
trees stripped of their last leaf und
looking like so many scarecrows.
'This has been a rather quiet day
only two mine explosions," said the
commandant, "two men injured, one in
the shoulder, the other In the leg. That
Is little, for often we have forty to
sixty men killed or injured la these
mine explosions, which go on continu
ally as the Germans try to mine under
our trenches and we try to mine un
der theirs."
Even beyond the front line Frencb
trenches the French soldiers had
pushed their observation posts into the
flre-swept dividing line, 300 yards wide.
Some of these daring men could be
seen almost up to the crest, where the
German line ran. They were crouched
behind heaps of bowlders, rifles reudy.
British big guns nre hammering
breastwork beinfe thrown up In front
verdure to make It harmonize with
-WaavU'
"Those men- are only tea ycrds front
tho Germans," sold the commandant.
As he spoke, Mr. Cravath of New
Sork, said: "I see a German; there
be Is on the crest ; you can see his uni
form with the round cap."
"And he sees you too," said the com
mandant. "You have been under Are,"
he added as he led Mr. Cravath and, the
others to a more secure position.
"It's good that German didn't Are,"
remarked Cravath. "It might have
been an international Incident Think
of It killing an American visitor to
the French trenches."
Coming back from the front-line
trenches one had' a view of the many
ceaseless activities in carrying on this
great battle. At one point soldiers in
shirt sleeves were digging graves in an
Improvised cemetery along the-forest
path. The cemetery was very large
and had been given a name, "Muison
Forrestlere," or Forest Home. Every
grave had a wooden cross above it with
the name and regiment of the dead sol
dier. The shells kept whizzing and burst
ing as the party moved along, and' It
got lo be n pleasant pastime to note
the long s-z-z-z as the shells flew over
head. One of them struck a few hun
dred feet away, throwing up trees,
earth and clouds of smoke.
To those who wanted souvenirs there
were big fragments of shrapnel lying
at every turn. It was pleasant at first
to pick them up, but after three or four
of these heavy chunks of steel were
carried half a mile the task was aban
doned. The Ingenuity of some of the trench
quarters along the way is shown In
the use of empty glass bottles for win
dows. One ollieer pointed with pride
to the very artistic effec; he hud se
cured with these empty wine bottles.
A triple row extended all across the
front of his log shack, giving light
within nnd having rather a cathedral
window effect without. The bottles
are of white glass, used for bottling
the white wine of Bordeaux.
Lives Outside City.
The headquarters of General Nl
velle, In commuod of the operations at
Verdun, are quite n way outside the
city, at a little crossroad hamlet,
which cannot bo named for military
reasons. The general's offices are In
the town courthouse, n two-story stone
structure. It was in this same build
ing that General Petaln, who preceded
Nlvelle, and General de Castelnau
quickly made the plans at the first on
rush of the Germans, which held them
until re-enforcements could be brought
up.
General Nlvelle goes to Verdun nnd
along the trench front frequently. But
most of his time is at headquarters,
in telegraph nnd telephone communi
cation with the whole circle of de
fenses, and In touch, too, with the
other army corps and masses of sup
plies ready to be moved forward to All
any gap the Germans may make.
As we were at General Nlvelle's
headquarters a party of Germnn pris
oners came by. They marched two
nnd two, their gruy uniforms and round
caps contrasting, with the French blue
and casque. Already they were be
ing set to work, and instead of n gun
each German carried a spade over Ills
shoulder. At Verdun there is no ci
vilian life whatever, but around Gen
eral Nlvelle's headquarters there were
peasant women' and girls mingling with
the pollus. Indicating civilian life still
existed thus near to the bombarded
town.
The roads back of Verdun present
the most vnrled scenes of activity. On
one side is a vast aeroplane camp, with
some twenty enormous hangars of bas
ket steel construction covered with
canvas. Across the rood is a riding
course running for miles, where officers
can exercise their mounts ami' cavalry
can push forward in emergency with
out blocking the highroad. Every now
and then one sees a big vehicle shoot
by bearing the sign "American Am
bulance Corps."
Mules in Good Shape.
The thousands of horses and mules

but after a month's feeding they;

: the mules one of the officers said :
"The demobilization of the Greek

which the Greeks had been' using, audi

While the fields bock of Verdtro are
rich with yellow grain, yet there 1st
one melancholy evidence of the war lnt
the burning of manure, usually the
very life blood of tho soil. Tfoe graltt
can be gathered by the soldiers and the
women who remain, but there Is no
time to distribute the manure over tha
land, and so it Is burned.

SHOULD HELP HER HUSBAND;
Court Decides Crime Is No Cause for
Divorce Defines Habitual
Drunkard:
Des Moines, la. The Iowa supreme
court, lu session here, has handed down
several Solomonic decisions.
In one ruling, the court held that
confession of a crime on tho part of a
husband does not constitute grounds
for divorce proceedings.
"It ill becomes a wife," said the
court, "to- prefer criminal charges
against her husband. She took him for
better or for worse, and she should try
to redeem him."
In the same decision the court de
fined a habitual drunkard as "one who
becomes even moderately Intoxicated
whenever the opportunity is pre
sented."
