Submarine Is Not Seriously Damaged; Only One Is Saved
From Tug; He Said Boilers Exploded After Little
Ship Was Lifted High in Air and Nose Shoved Under
Sea by U-Boat
New London, Conn., Nov. 17.—Five lives were lost when the
German submarine Deutschland, which left port early to-day for
Bremen, rammed and sent to the bottom with its crew of five the
tug T. A. Scott, Jr., one of its two convoying tugs*. After the acci
dent the Deutschland returned to port.
The Dead
Captain John Gurney.
William A. Caton, engineer.
Kdward Stone, fireman.
Clarence B. Davison, Cook.
Eugene Duzant, deck hand.
I toilers Exploded
The collision occurred about a mile
inside the Race and according to a
member of the Deutschland's crew,
came "all in a minute." The tug. he
said, got unexpectedly in front of the
Deutschland, the distance being so
slight between them the submersible
had no chance of. avoiding the acci
dent. Her nose struck the tug near the
stern, lifting it well out of the water
and sending the Scott's nose under.
Almost immediately afterward the
boilers on the. tug exploded and the
vessel sank with all on board.
Deutschland Slightly Hurt
Captain Fred Hinsch, of the intern
ed German steamer Neckar, who was
on the tug grasped a guy rope and was
drawn down with the tug. When he
rose to the surface he managed to
grasp a life preserver which had been
thrown out by the Deutschland and
was taken on board the vessel, by
which he was brought back to New
London.
The Deutschland was not seriously
damaged. It was stated, and would
probably be ready to sail in a few days
when repairs had been made. Several
of the bow plates were bent and the
rivets loosened, but the interior of
the submarine was not damaged. The
repairs will be made by members of
the crew.
Eddy Caused Accident
An "eddy" caused the accident, ac
' cording to Captain Harry Baker, of
the tug Cassie, the other convoyer of
the submarine. The Cassie was trav
eling about half a mile astern of the
Deutschland while the Scott and the
submarine were moving about abreast.
The sea was calm, Captain Baker said,
and conditions were normal. The
Scott carried the usual lights but the
Deutschland had only her headlight
and two side lights. The tide was
running .almost full and when about
seven miles west of Race Rock they
struck an "eddy" which twisted them
about and out of control. Shortly af
terward they canie together. He
heard the crash. The night was clear,
he said, and there were no boats other
than the two tugs and the submarine
Deutschland in the vicinity, lie gave
no credence to reports that a hostile
motorboat was approaching the sub
marine at the time of the accident.
Captain Baker said that when the
collision occurred he at once headed
for the spot. On arriving there he
saw Captain Hinsch in the water and
took him on board the Cassie. Earl
ier reports had it that Hlnch had
been rescued by the Deutschland.
Hole Being Repaired
Henry G. Hilken of Baltimore, pres
ident of the Eastern Forwarding Com
pany, said that so far as he knew the
only damage the Deutschland suf
fered was a twisted stem. It was

the midst of our peace and happiness,
out thoughts dwell with painful dis
quiet upon the struggles and sufferings

I son. President of the United States of
America, do appoint Thursday, the
f 30th of November, as a day of national
thanksgiving and prayer and urge and
advise the people to resort to their
several places of worship on that day
ot render thanks to Almighty God for
the blessings of peace and unbroken
| prosperity which He has bestowed
| upon our beloved country in such un
, stinted measure.
"And I also urge and suggest our
I duty in this our day of peace and
i abundance to think in deep sympathy
{ of the stricken peoples of the world on
i whom the curse and terror of war has
j so pitilessly fallen and to contribute
I out of our abundant means to the re
lief of their sufferings.
"Our people could in no better way
; show their real attitude towards the
present struggle of the nations than
|by contributing out of their abun
j dance to the relief of the suffering
! which war has brought in its train.
"In witness whereof. I have here
unto set my hand and caused the seal
I of the United States to be affixed.
"Done at the city of Washington

unanimous vote to-day declared
against that provision of President
Wilson's legislative program "making
illegal any railroad strike or lockout
prior to the investigation of the merits
of the case."
The committee report, which was
adopted, recommended that the con

againft compulsory institutions and in
favor of the maintenance of Insti
tutions and opportunities for free

The convention had before it that
section of the executive council's re
port dealing with the railroad brother
hoods' threatened strike. Referring to
the bill Introduced in Congress for
the purpose of preventing strikes and
interruptions of transportation mod
eled after the Canadian compulsory
Investigations act, the report says:
"This effort to again subject wage
earners to involuntary servitude has
aroused the determined resistance of
wage-earners generally. To their dec

the proponents of the legislation have
replied that although a strike would
be made illegal under the proposed
law and strikers criminals, yet indi

tion of Spring styles and fabrics for
women is the plan up for discussion
before the National Cloak, Suit and
Skirt Manufacturers' Association
which opened its annual convention

shades will be the most flower-like and
delicate imaginable."

M COU.MICK OKNIKS RUMOR
Chairman Intimates 'Ho Will Not Re
in Wilson's Cabinet
New York, Nov. 17. Vance C.
! McCormick, Democratic national chair-
I man, arrived in the city yesterdav on
his way to New Haven to see the Yale
football team. Mr. McCormick is
chairman of the football committee
of Yale and is exhibiting almost as
m tic si interest in the. condition of his
college team as lie did in the recent
campaign.
He said all the details of the Demo
cratic campaign had been cleaned up
with the exception of raising the
#300,000 deficit in the treasury. He
expressed confidence that this amount
would be contributed quickly.
His attention was called to the many
reports that he would become a mem
ber of President Wilson's Cabinet after
March 4. He denied these reports with
a good-natured smile.
"My address for the next four years
will be Harrtsburg. Pa.," he laughed.
"I am going back to the simple life."
Just the same, the opinion prevails
j in political circles that Mr. McCormick
can have a Cabinet place if he desires.
