EDGE PACT
TRAFFIC ORDINANCE
TO BE ENFORCED
Five Extra Policemen Will Co on Duty
Tomorrow to Direct People Cor
rect Way to Drive.
Realizing fully the demand for the
enforcement of tho traffic ordinances
that aro on the statute hooks of the
city of Ilryan, the council has taken
the mutter up and as a result on to
morrow morning five extra policemen
will do sworn In and go on duty for
the purposo of directing tho public In
the correct way to drive on tho city's
streets.
Hlcns have been erected at each
street Intersecting Main street from
22nd to 2Hth and at each of these
places a policeman will bo stationed.
The pavement on Main street has been
drawn off with red lines painted down
same and the new officers have In
structions from Mayor Harris to en
force tho traffic ordinance to tho let
ter. Tho traffic ordinance In Rryan Is
very simple. While long In detail. It
simply has one real meaning and that
Is, you must drive on tho right side of
the street at all times and In turning
corners you must make a circle
around tho center of the street or
around the guide posts. It Is no trou
ble to do this and will bo the means
of avoiding many accidents. In turn
ing around on Main street tho ordi
nance provides that you must go to
tho next comer above where you are
located when you aro ready to turn.
Tho policemen have been told that for
tho first few days not to make any ar
rests for violations, but at toon as
the people have had the proper train
ing all violators can expect to pay a
fine for violations. The speed limit
on Mnln street Is IS miles per hour
sod If you do not have a speedometer
on ynur car It might be well to Invest
In one.
This action Is very commendable on
the city's part and the rltlrens should
by all means cooperate with tho new
officers, and It will only take a short
time to get everything to ninnlnt
smooth, and the possibility Is that It
will le one of your own dear loved
ones whose life was saved by the traf
fic ordinance being observed very
losely.
If you aro hailed by one of the new
policemen, stop and listen to what he
has to tell you: he Is the law and what
he tolls jou will bo right. Heed him.
