President in Thanksgiving
Proclamation Calls Atten

A
Thariks'iv iiiK proclamation issued
by Brest Wilson this afternoon,
charges the people of the United
States with responsibility to con
tribute largely toward relief In
Kurope. "out of our abundant
means."
The proclamation said America
should he doubly thankful because
of "the blessings of peace and un
broken prosperity:
The. proclamation follows:
By the president of the United
States of America:
A IToclanLatton.
"It has long been the custom of
our people to turn in the fruitful
autumn of the year in praise and
thanksgiving to Alminhty do. I for
His many blessings and mercies to
us as a nation. The year that ha?-elap-ed
since we last observed our
day of thanks-giving h;.. been rich
in blessings to us as a people, but
the whole face of the world has
been darkened by war. In the midst
of our pence and happiness, our
thoughts dwell with painful disquiet
i.pon the struggles and sufferings of
the nations at war and the peoples
upon whom war has brought disaster
without choice or possibility of es
cape on their part. We cannot
think of our own happiness without
thinking also of their pitiful distress.
"Now, therefore. I, Woodrow Wil
fcn. president of the United States
of America, do appoint Thursday,
the :;oth of November, as a day of
national thanksgiving ami prayer,
and urge and advise the people to
resort to their several places of
worship on that day to render
thanks to Almighty God for the
blessings .jf peace and unbroken
prosperity which He has bestowed
upon our beloved country u such
u11stint.1l measure. Ami I also urge
and suggest our duty in this, ok: day
of pea e and abundance to think in
deep sympathy of the stricken
peoples .of the world upon whom the
curst' ami terror of war has so
pitilessly fallen, and to contribute
out of our abundant means to the
lelief of their sufferings. Our "eopK
could in no better way show- their
leal attitude toward the present
struggle of the nations than b con
tributing out of their abundance to
the relief of suffering which war
Las brought in its train.

Gen. Trevino Has Less Than

paring to Evacr.ate.
Intr rnat'.onal News Service:
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17. Luis
Cabrera's continued opposition to
the plan of Mexican border control
agreed to by his colleagues of the
Mexican-American commission at
Atlantic t'ity may brin about an
impasse at once serious enough to
force adjournment of the confer
ence without definite results.
Strict secrecy is maintained at the
state department as to the terms of
the agreement in which the three
American commissioners and two
of the .Mexicans are in accord. It
is understood, however, that while it
provides for the withdrawal of the
American troops now iu Mexico, it
also gives the American government
authority to send armed forces into
Mexico at any time in pursuit of
organized bandits who may com
mit depredations on American bor
der towns similar to Villa's sack of
nlu mhos, N. M. This arrangement,
however, would not be reciprocal.
Uabrera he stoutly maintained that
any arrangement as to the pursuit of
the raiders should apply to the
United Staes and Mexico alike.
It is thought probable that Cah
rera. in opposing the border agree
ment, represents the views of First
Chief Carranza. Officials here, es
pecially those of the war depart
ment, do not believe Carranza will
agree to any stipulation which does
not set forth that Mexico and the
United States are equal powers.
