throws. The Dentin;; forwards did
not mako any field goals but scored
twice on the 15 free throws Out of

THE KNOWN WINNERS.
Wilson has carried New Mexico by
a plurality in excess of 2000.
Jones has been elected United
states senator. Conservative Demo
crats claim his plurality will bo np
proximatck 3300. Conservative Re
-ed 2700.
SVolton has been elected repre
sentative in congress. Democrats
jtimnte his plurality nt from 1200
;o 1500. Republicans claim that il
.vill bo held down to less than 500.
De Haca has been dieted governor.
Democrats placo his plurality at
about, the same figuros. as Walton's,
Republicans admit that he will have
'rom 800 to 1000 votes to spare.
Field, Swinncy, and Davisson, on
tho Democratic ticket, have bcon
defeated, Lucord, Hall and Montoya
on tho same ticket, have been elected
Democratic Stuto Chairman Selig
man, however, declines to concede the
lefeat of any of the Democratic can
lidatoH save George A. Davisson for
mJs8ioner of public lands. The
Republicans, on the other hand, claim
ho election of Frank W. Clancy, their
candidato for attorney general, by 80
votos. It is believed it will require
tho official count to dotormine the re
suit between W. E. Lindscy or Gov
ernor McDonald, candidates for lieu
tenant governor. Oaring to tho frail
health of Govornor-eiect Do baca, the
office of lieutenant lusumes unusual
inipoitance.
CAMPBELL LEADS IN ARIZONA
Except for an apparent increase of
17 votos in favor of Campbell, Re
publican candidato for governor, giv
ing him an estimated lead of 187
over Hunt, incumbont, thoro was no
development today in the guhcrmv
torial situation. In Republican quar
tors tho election of Campbell is being
claimed by 210 majority, whilo 'the
Hunt faction declares .s candidate is
safe. On tho face of tho present re
turns with but orto or 'two. precincts
not jo.fflc.iaHy reportad, i is ijcncrally
boJíoycuV that tho Campbell - majority
will stand.

REDROCK.

The one quart of election goods con
tributed! to this district v.as soon con
sumed, and as it could n it bo ascer
tained which party passed the hat
for the liberal supply, no one knew to
whom to apply for another quart, so
there was nothing drunk or disorderly
bout this election.
