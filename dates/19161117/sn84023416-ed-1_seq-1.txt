HEAVY SNOW FALL
Conies Early and Makes Good
Sleighing 8 to 12 Inches Falls
in First Storm of the Season.
Snow began falling Sunday even
ing and continued all day Monday
and into Tuesday forenoon. The fall
varies in different localities from
eight to 12 inches. This is a remark
able early storm, of the depth to
make good sleighing, and coming as
it did November 13th, it is a force
ful reminder of the long,cold winter
to follow. It does not seem possible
that this fall of snow will remain
long. However, the roads were in
fine condition for this to make ex
cellent sleighing, and lumbermen
will not object if it remains until
spring, but six months of winter
weather makes the summer season
in these northern latitudes extremely
short.
This storm is surely a record
breaker and will be handed down in
the weather records as one of the
heaviest falls of snow to come the
first weeks in November. There is
good sleighing all through northern
Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine,
and down to the city of Portland.

"It means more to us railroad
men to have this Association here
than anyone can realize. We come
in here dirty, cold.hungry and tired.
We get warm, have a good bath,
cook our supper, smoke and talk,
perhaps read a paper or magazine,
play a game and go to bed. It is
certainly Christian work the Associa
tion is doing in so helping us." So
said an engineer to the State Secre
tary only a few days before his life
was crushed out in a railroad ac
cident. He was speaking of .the Railroad
Association at Island Pond, Vt.,
which was organized October 20,
1903. Through the liberality of the
Grand Trunk Railway and the towns
people the building was opened in
December 1903 free of debt. The
people of the town contributed
$2,500, and the railroad gave $4,500,
as well as the site and ever since
then has given a liberal monthly con
tribution to its work.
The building is an attractive and
convenient one, and was erected to
serve the men of the railroad, so it
is placed near the tracks and they
have only a short distance to walk
to it after their run is ended and it
takes the place of home to them
when they are away from home.
The Association has never been
closed for an hour since it was first
opened and the General Secretary
Wells F. Morong has never seen the
door key.
The dormitories contain thirty-four
beds and they are in constant use
day and night and often during the
busy season men are obliged to wait
until someone goes out on his run
and the bed is made up again. The
bath rooms contain tub and shower
baths. The lunch room, which is
fitted up with oil ran,n;e, dishes,
Vote for County Officers in Essex County
Senntor Asst. Judges Judge
table, hot and cold water, is for the
free use of all the men and in it they
can cook any time. The social life
centers in the three large rooms on
the first floor where there are a good
pool table, games of chess, checkers,
dominoes, a large number ot papers
and magazines, a well fitted book
case, a letter-writing table, a piano,
and the secretaiy's office. In the
basement is located the gymnastic
apparatus, shuffle board, bowlirg al
leys, as well us the tub and shower
baths and toilet. The large room
for meetings, sociables and similar
affairs is located on the -second floor
and there is also a well supplied
kitchen.
Island Pond is the division point
of the Grand Trunk between Mont
real and Portland, with freight
yards, roundhouse and repair shops.
So the building is extensively used
by office men, operators, train mas-
; - .uJ J

ters, dispatchers, conductors, en
gineers, firemen, brakemen, switch
men, shopmen, as well as the boys
and men of the town. Being but 15
miles from the Canadian boundary
line, Island Pond is an important
port of the United States customs.
The work of the association is car
ried on along the usual four lines
religious, social, physical and educa
tional. While in the true sense all
the work of the association is religi
ous the activities which are distinct
ively so are carried on. They include
the Sunday afternoon meeting for
men, the correspondence Bible study
course, "The Doctor's Story," and
the persiwial work. The Week of
Prayer is always observed and this
year the ' attendance was especially
good. Daily meetings are held at
eight o'clock in the evening. Occas
ionally an evangelistic campaign is
carried on and a number of men
have been led into the Christian
life and church membership, and
many have been helped and strength
ened in their Christian work
The social life in the association is
good and there is a fine spirit of fel
lowship apparent. Many are the
talks which the men have together
while watching the games and there
is a homelike atmosphere about the
building. The pool table is in use
most of the time and there are
many games of checkers, chess and
dominoes played. There is an or
ganized chess and checker club.
During the year a good number of
special and social events are held.
While there are no organized
classes in the physical work yet the
chest weights, dumb bells and Indian
clubs are used by the members for
individual work. Bowling is a popu
lar exercise and a good number of
