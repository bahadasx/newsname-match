DEATH CLAIMS
JOHNROTHLISBERG
Prominerft Young Stock Man
Stricken and Dies Within
24 Hours—Operation Fails
to Save Life.
"In the midst of life we are in
death."
The uncertainty of life and the
certainty of death, as expressed
in the above quotation, was per
haps never more fully brought
home to us than through the sud
den death of Johnnie Rothlisberg
in our city Wednesday afternoon.
Going about his business affairs
one day as full of life as one
could wish to be, he lay cold in
death's embrace scarcely twenty
four hours later, and his family
and friends could hardly realize
he had been called .from their
midst.
John Rothlisberg has been en
gaged in buying stock for Car
steen & Co. of Tacoma, for the
past two or three years and has
been in the habitj'of coming to
Cottonwood almost every week to
receive and ship stock from this
station. He came over as usual
on Monday and received several
cars of cattle from Platt & Jones,
of the Joseph country, and
shipped the cattle out on Tuesday
morning's train. He completed
the morning's work by settling
up for the stock purchased and
seemed to be in the best of
health and spirits. In the after
noon he was sitting in the hotel
lobby figuring over his accounts
when he was suddenly stricken
with severe cramps in the stom
ach and bowels. Physicians wei e
at once summoned but all were
out of town at the time. Dr.
Turner was the first to return
and did all in his power to check
the attack. The cramps returned
however, during the night, and
it was realized that an operation
was the only chance for saving
the patient's life and even this
was slight. Dr. Slusser was sum
moned from Grangeville and the
operation was performed shortly
before noon, when it was found
that the stomach was ruptured
and all hopes were at an end.
Death came at 1:05 o'clock in the
afternoon.
John Rothlisberg was born in
Texas and was 33 years of age
at the time of his death. He
came to Idaho county with his
parents when a child and has
spent most of his life here. After
finishing school he followed farm
ing for several years, then en
gaged in the meat business at the
county seat, and in recent years
has been buying stock. He leaves
a wife and two children, a
mother, several brothers and
many friends to mourn his un
timely loss. He was a quiet, un
assuming young man of fine char
acter and excellent business char
acteristics, and will be deeply
mourned by his large circle of
friends over the county.
The remains were prepared for
burial at the Nau undertaking
parlors and were shipped to
Grangeville Wednesday evening
where they are being held until
the mother and a brother can ar
rive from Salt Lake City. The
funeral will probably be held Sun
day afternoon.
The Chronicle joins with friends
of the bereaved family in extend
ing to them sincere sympathy in
their great loss.
Contractor Lasker is making
fine progress on the Peterson
building and now has the walls
well up above the first story. He
will complete the brick work
next week and will have the
building ready for occupancy in
the near future.
Securing Satisfactory Grade
State Engineer Booth passed
through Cottonwood Wednesday
morning enroute from Grange
ville to Lewiston. In speaking
about the location of the north
and south road he said it was the
policy of the State Highway Com
mission when planning and sur
veying state roads to secure the
most practical and direct route
between the points sought to be
connected or territory tobe
served. In as much as the state
helps to build these roads and
once built, maintains them, the
state's' interest is equivalent if
not greater than that of the local
district that it serves because the
maintainance cost is a consider
able item.
When his attention was called
to the present survey north of
town cutting up property as it
does, he said that no matter
what route would have been
taken this same condition might
and would have pertained. How
ever that this part of the sarvey
will likely be changed if found
chat a more practicable, route
can be secured or one that does
not cut up property so badly;
that it may be necessary to re
locate certain sections because it
is impossible to determine with
one survey which is the best
route. Mr. Booth said that the
man in charge of this survey
work, Mr. Burns, had reported
to him that in general a most
satisfactory route had been se
cured.

ELECTION ROW
IN SOOTH IDAHO
Republicans Claim Irregulari
ties Enough in Southeast to
Elect Davis—Case Will Be
Taken Into Court.
All kinds of election stories are
coming out of Boise these days
and if most of them are to be be
lieved there is liable to be a lively
contest down in the south end of
the state before a number of the
state and county candidates are
seated. Most of the reports have
to do with alleged election irreg
ularities in southern aad south
eastern counties, and it is claimed
by the republicans that when
matters are finally Bifted in one
or two counties Davis \?ill have
been elected over Alexander and
at least one entire republican
county ticket will have been
elected.
The first report came from
Bonneville county, in the south
east, where it is said the county
commissioners threw out 921
votes in two precincts when the
canvass of the returns was made.
The commissioners tried to get
the judges of election to recount
the ballots in another precinct
but the judges refused. It is
claimed that the voters in many
instances marked a cross in the
large circle at the top of the re
publican ticket, thereby voting a
straight ticket, and then pro
ceeded to maks a cross after the
name of Alexander and other
candidates on the democratic
ticket but failing to mark out the
names of the republican candi
dates they did not care to vote
for. The election judges appar
ently held that the intent of the
voter was plain and counted the
ballots for such democratic can
didates as were voted for. The
county commissioners undoubted
ly held an opposite view and
caused a recount in a couple of
precincts, with the above result.
Tne news from Bonneville
county brought up claims of ir
regularities in other counties
and it was reported that investi
gations would also be held in
Ada, Power, Canyon and other
counties.
Be this as it may, the news
stories point more toward a few
irregularities than to any intent
at fraudulent voting and it is
quite probable that when matters
quiet down the irregularities will
prove much less than at first re
ported.
In any event the case presents
a nice legal complication and if
carried into court the matter
may take months to decide.
Another story coming from
Boise is to the effect that J ames
E. Pinnock, one of the democra
tic presidential electors, is not
qualified to act by reason of hav
ing also been a candidate for the
state legislature from Custer
county and having been elected,
and this would give his vote to
the nearest republican elector,
thereby giving three of Idaho's
electoral votes to Wilson and one
to Hughes.
Ed. Rathbone sold his stage
line and barn property at this
place this week to Albert Rogers
and intends leaving later for Cali
fornia to spend the winter. Mr.
Rogers took charge of the stage
line Wednesday and will operate
the same in future.
The first card party of the win
ter season to be given by the K. C.
lodge was held at the hail Wed
nesday evening and was quite
well attended. Progressive five
hundred was enjoyed until after
eleven o'clock and all present
had a very i leasant time.
Election Makes Many Changes
As a result of last week's elec
tion Idaho went into the demo
cratic column by a handsome
majority, giving Wilson a plural
ity of 15,000 votes, and carrying
almost the entire democratic
state ticket into office. All can
didates on the democratic ticket
except treasurer, superintendent
of-public instruction and mine in
spector were elected and the
democrats will control both
houses of the next legislature.
A Boise dispatch has the fol
lowing to say regarding the elec
tion:
For the first time in a number
of years an Idaho legislature will
probably be democratic in both
branches when the legislature
elect convenes in Boise in Janu
ary, 1917. Returns from 33 of
the 37 counties in the state give
the democrats 20 senators out of
a possible 37, while in the house
the democrats have 36 members
and the republicans 25, if the
most reliable information obtain
able at this time is correct. Such
well-known candidates for sena
tor as John Hart of Jefferson
county, Nathan Ricks of Madison
county, James E. Steele of
Bonneville county, E. S. Sweet
of Idaho county, Guy H. Martin
of Bonner county and I. I. Pur
cell of Washington county were
defeated. A. H. Conner, speaker
of the last house; W. L. Shad
duck of Bonneville county; H. A.
Lawson, a member of the twelfth
legislature and author of the
mothers' pensien bill, Ada coun
ty republican nominee for state
senator; D. J. Elrod of Bannock
county, and others went down to
defeat before the slide.
First reports indicated the de
feat of Peter G. Johnson of Bing
ham county, for a number of
sessions leader of the house, but
returns from a precinct reporting
late saved him. In Custer coun
ty Senator Ravenal MacBeth was
defeated. For many years until
the present he has been reelected
from that county and news of
his defeat came as a genuine
surprise.
For the first time in years a
democrat will preside over the
senate. Ernest L. Parker of
Cottonwood, a democrat, was
elected lieutenant governor over
B. M. Holt, republican, and will
drop the gravel when the upper
house is called to order.
Makes Them Like Idaho
Mrs. E. L. Martin and little
daughter were in the city Wed
nesday afternoon from near Win
ona and left yesterday for Tur
ner, Ore., to spend a few weeks
with relatives. While here Mrs.
Martin gave us some interesting
figures about their grain crop
this year. They threshed 6,975
sacks of wheat and barley and
sold the grain last week at Kam
iah. The wheat which was of
the Marquis variety, brought
$1 56è per bushel and the barley
$1.87à per hundred pounds. The
wheat grown on a hundred acres
of rented ground sold for an
average of $62.70 per acre, while
the barley averaged $47.69 an
acre. Mrs. Martin said they are
not inclined to leave Idaho now
and are more than pleased with
results since they came to Camas
prairie.
