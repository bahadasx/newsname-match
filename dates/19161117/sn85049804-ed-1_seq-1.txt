In the United 8tates.
The presidents of universities, col

D& JAMBS SBXFABD.
It possible for such a conference ito be

tion's efforts to provide adequate equip
ment for the training of spccial groups
•of students for speolal lines of work
has been admirably shown. And again
tiie financial assistance of other white
friends of the nice at the south and in
the north through' "the Influence of
members of the board and the sound
constructive, work of Dr, Shepard
made it possible for the school to enter
upon the present year's work clear of
•debt These are encouraging signs as
to the extent white people are inter

tions for our people under the right
kind of leadership.
Just in proportion as these groups of
white people in different sections of
4 he country become informed as to tne
struggles* needs, aspirations and
achievements.of the colored people will
our handicap be romoved and a more
friendly relation between the white
and colored people'be increased. The
above statement is borne oat from the
fact that not only the leaders of ofor

MEMORIES OFWASHINGTON.
While I sat thinking and dreaming
today,
My thoughts strayed from me, and
wandered away
Like seed sub-planted by tain and
sun,
And roamed on memories of Wash
ington.
Back in my memory, there reigned
supreme,
A picture of one, though spotless it
seemed
Yet, faded with sorrow and pitiful
need,
But radiant with love, that knows no
creed.
His deeds and words are pictures rare
Still hung on wills of time,, most bare
Of men that climbed the wall of fame,
On stones of courage, minus praise
of name. 'V
They'll 'dorn the memories of Jives to
come,
To dee the work of a man, well done
With pride they'll view their niaster
piece, .':
Arid tongues will proclaim, "He's not
the least."
Away from, all dtfst and d4cay of tjme.
I'll hide his memories with secluslve
sign, v.:.,.
Which reads, "A rare trophy, won-f
Through vast achievements of Boofker

HAMPTON DEFEATS UNION,'
Team From University-at
Va, Outelaseed In Featball Q»aa
By LAWRINCB A. UB.
And there la another victory hang
ing to the Hampton football machlofl
On Friday, Nor. 8, the Hampton ami
Union football squads met on the
taqnpton Institute gridiron with ttw
following remits:
The game started by Union MpUBf
off to Hampton. The kick was re
ceived by J. H. Harvey, the slick quar
terback, and brought up the Held for
thirty yards. Both teams lined tip fast
utd charged Ilka fiends. Captain Dor
ley swept around right ei^for fifteen
yards on the second down.
Union tightened up, holding Ham]
ton for tiie fourth down. Dotaey
,ed from the center of the field over
Union's goal line. The ball was then
brought out to the twenty yard Una
and'put Into play. Both teams fought
desperately,' for the ball was at this
time in Hampton's territory. Uulon
fumbled twice before the fourth dow*.
bat luck was with the state capital
boys, and one of their men -covered
the pigskin each time.
Hucles "breezed around" Hamptoril
end, making a good gain, but a piece
of the blue and white machinery
struck him, causing him to be lame
the rest of the game. Despite his
game leg, Hucles attempted to punt
bat Charlie Dick, lightning tackle, was
always on the Job to block the ban.
The second quarter opened with Union
over thp bait During the greater part
of this quarter the teams played from
one end of the gridiron to the other.
Hampton's center, Bed Dabney, be
came ferocious and began to go ever
Union's line, picking off the quarter
back before he could pass the ball.
The greatest feature of this quarter
was the twenty yard forward pass by
Hampton from Harvey to Dofsey,
which caused the first touchdown,
The university boys then lined up un
der the goal with grim faces, but Dor
sey failed to kick the goal, so their
faces became' covered with smilas
again. The touchdown by Happton
didn't take any of the courage out of
tie Union aggregation. The Union
team came back and fought ntMair
than they ha^ previously fought
Hampton kicked off to Union. The
catch was made by Gregory, vriio sub
stituted in Hucles' position. Tne most
exciting time of -the game was at hand,
for Gregory came, through Hampton's
ILue like lightning for sixty yards. Un
ion began to gain through Hampton's
line and reached within five yards yf
their goal after several plays, but on
the fourth down thire ciune a fumble
which caused Union to fjffl bafck near
ly"ten yards. The end of the first half
was at hand, with Hampton ahead.
The second half began by Union
kicking to Hampton. This third quar
ter brought great Joy to the visitors,
for it was in this quarter that they
ontplayed the seaside machine, mak
ing their first touchdown. They failed,
however, to kick goal. The rest of the
quarter was spent in playing up and
down the field.
The fourth quarter opened with the
ball in Hampton's pasture. After sev
eral line plays Harvey tried one of his
famous passes to Mundy, who. sub
stituted for Meadows. Mundy made
a sensational catch, gaining fifteen
yards. Hampton again plunged Un
ion's Ilnd until they were were within
three yards of the goal. Union was
off side and was penalized, causing
Hampton to get another touchdown.
Dorsey failed to kick goal.
Toward the last of the quarter Hamp.
ton was within thirty yards of their
goal when Harvey drop kicked oner
over the bar. The quirter ended giv.
Ing Hampton's great machine a vic
tory over the visitors to the tune of
13 tod.
A great deal of credit is due to Crfp
tain Dorsey, Red Rttbney, Rlgney and
Dixon of Hampton also to Gregory,
Captain Puryear, Thompson and Watts
of Union. Hucles Is always to be re
membered when a kicking argument
arises.

Mr. John L. Thompson, Editor By

Dear Sir: By reading your paper
I find some very important news. I
am a married woman, but with no one
in the family but I and my husband,
which makes it very lonesome for me.
I wish I could have written you at
an early date some very interesting
items. I see you are soon to have a
home for orphan children. Could you
kindly let me know if I wuld get a
nice little adopted child. *They seem
to be so scarce out here. It would
have a nice Christian home I go to
church regularly and would like a
child for company. Would treat it
like one of my own. A nice little
brown haired child 4 'years old up to
*13. I am very anxious. Would you
let me know at once. If one could be
sent out this far I would let you Know
every week about it. My husband is
a good Working man. Please answer.
Sincerely yours,
Mrs. N. Howard,

FORT DODGE, IOWA.
Your last publication of November
11th contained in Fort Dodge items
news concerning W. L. Perkins going
crazy, written by an unknown .report
er of this city. While there are three
families of Perkins in this city, I can't
see why the reporter did not get an
interview with some, d£ them and
write the story correctly. Lewis Per
kins did not go crazy, as stated by
the egile reporter. Mr. Perkins is
perfectly sane.' What might have
been a temporary case was prevented
by doctors of that city. I trust your
publication of this communication
will be read by the sane subscribers
and friends who read the issue of No
vember 11th, and get the truth con
cerning Lewis Perkins. The article
also stated that Mother R. A. Perkins
•and Willa Coleman, sister, departed
also for California. Not so. Only*
Frank Perkins departed for Los An
geles. Geo. E. Perkins.
