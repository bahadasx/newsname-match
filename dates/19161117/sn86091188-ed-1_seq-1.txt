UNDERPAID EMPLOYES
WANT THEIR SHARE
Thousands of workers on the rail
roads of the northwest are joining
the movement of the committee of
employes known as the "Eigthy Per
Ceni" now securing petitions to con
gress for an investigation of the
wages and working cond.uons of all
railway employes before pay in
creases are put into effect as pro
vided by ttie Adamson law. Repre
sentatives of employes, other than
the twenty per cent how included
in the provisions of the Adamson act,
making a tour in the interest of the
eighty per cent not coming under the
provisions of the act, declare that
the future welfare of all railway
workers is at stake.
I'nder the Adamson law an in
crease would go to train service em
ployes that w'ould preclude for years
to come wage increases for those
workers to which there is no refer
ence made in tne act, and for that
reason the measure as it now reads
is opposed by about 1,600,000 em
ployes. Even on the present basis
°f pay, trainmen and enginemen,
many of whom do not require the
years of specialized training, nor
work daily the long hours that fall
to the lot of mechanics, trackmen,
clerks, etc., draw greater compensa
tion. To grant the advances that
would accrue under the act recently

COUNCILMEN NOT
MATHEMATICIANS
SAID ONE MILL LEVY FOR LI
BRARY WOULD YIELD ONLY $80
ON $800,000 BASI8
A delegation from the Woman's
club of Salmon appeared before the
IS
tnl results
city council on Monday night to ask
financial aid for the public library
which the women propose to turn
over to the city at an early day. The
council had been advised of the re
quest in advance and upon the ad
vice of the city attorney, L. E. Glen
non, could find no way to meet it. Mr.
Glennon being present was called up
on to explain the limitations under
which such appropriations could be
made. They must come along, he
said, at the time of making the an
nual appropriations m the month of
May, when one mill on the dollar
may be levied for bubllc library pur
poses. Mr Glennon said there was
no fund from which any such approp
riation could be drawn at this time to
meet the requirements
His explanation was full and ex
plicit on this point and it had an ef
fect of dampening the ardor of the
piomotors of the library enterprise,
especially when the ladies were furth
ermore told by members that the
levy of one mill on the taxable basis
of $800,000 as allowed by law would
yield the insignificant sum of $80
a year only. The women asked what
the total property values were after
they had uttered a sigh or two as If
to say,"What's the use?"
They departed in a body of very
much dissatisfied if not disheartened
souls as they commented upon what
they had been told by the mayor and
councilmen. "Eigh.y dollars," was
one comment heard, "why that would
n't pay room rent."
There were other comments and
then halt a block away the ladles
began to think how under the rules
of mathematics a levy of one mill on
$800.000 would yield only the paltry
eighty dollars. Forthwith they went
back to ask about this Meanwhile
Councilman Haug, who had been do
ing some figuring himself declared
the answer should be $800 Instead
of $80 And the councilmen said the
taugh was on them, subsequently
the members of the delegation who
included Mrs. Stewart Mrs. Pres
ton, Mrs. Herndon, Mrs Wright and
Mrs. Melvin, said the recommenda
tion to the club would be to make a
i campaign toi a free library all the
I same and look to the next council
They were sufficiently assured that
the present council would help If It

It is declared by a Boston au
ihority that 80 per cent of the Unit
ed States copper production for the
first six months of 1917 has been
sold This would indicate that ord
ers for approximately 900,000,000
pounds of copper have been placed
on the producer's books for delivery
from January 1 to June 30 next, as
suming a monthly refinery' between
185.000.0uo and 190.uu0.000 pounds for
the period The value of this cop
per, based on a 26-cent average price
would approximate $235,000,000.
An important producing ana selling

HOW STATE AND NATION VOTE
certainty the result, was furnished by
The Recorder last Friday evening.
This statement refers, of course, to
the publication of news in Salmon.
The great number of conjectures
that came before that time in tele
graphic bulletins were wearisome.
Many of them hit wide of the truth
in declaring Hughes elected. They
were only guesses.
As soon as this paper ascertained
the result it was posted In its wndow.
Here Is the dispatch that came to
us last Friday:
Boise, Idaho, Nov. 11.—Idaho Re
corder: When California swung to
the Wilson column early today the
re-election of the president was assur
with a total electoral vote of at least
269. The only states remaining In
doubt are Minnesota, New Mexico and
New Hampshire and should Wilson
lose all these he would have the ma
jority in the electoral college. Wttj
son is leudingin New Mexico.
This is the first time in the his
tory of the country that a president
has been elected with the solid east
against him. Wilson carried but one
northern state east of the Mississippi,
Ohio, unless New Hampshire swings
tc him On the other hand Hughes
carried only Oregon west of the
Rocky mountains. Both branches of
cougressreniain democratic.
Moses Alexander re-elected Gover
nor by plurality of sivx to eight bun
died . Democratic landslide in Ida
ho; carried into ofTice Wallers for at
torney general, Dougherty for secre
'ary of state. Van Deusen for state
auditor, giving democrats control of
all boards. Republicans elected two
congressmen, the slate legislature

iusiruction. Both branches of th
legislature democratic. Senate 24
democrats anil i3 republicans. House
36 democrats, 28 republicans. On

the defeat of John Hart, republican
dean of tbe senate and Havenal Muc
