ul:º ý. l<< hs been Inaile in these states.
The situation is extraordiiniry and
has resulted in days of narve-rickitig
ýtr:in for the pIieople of tlihe country.
If th icctiion ollici;ils oif a few remte
pirciicts ini a few states know how tlihe
nation hias bee01n waiting hireatllless to
hear from thema, t hey avtst he swolled
up enormlously with a sense( of their
import-ance. For on those few pre
einets has depended the nation's choice
of its chief executive.
That Mr. Wilson's victory over Dir.
ilughes will not be conceded without ait
recount in the close states, such as Cal
ifornia, New Hampshire, New Mexico
and North Dakota, was determined at
conferences of the Republican leaders
here. Chairman Wilcox isserted a re
count would be demanded wherever
the margin of Democratic victory was
so small that comparatively few votes
would turn the scales. Hie and his as
rociates say they take the position
that there should be no cloud upon Mr.
Wilson's title to the presidency. The
Democrats, for their part deeared
that there must be a iecoi1t'Ot1t 'e
Hampshire, even though the returns
gave the state to Mr. Wilson.
That the returns are still incomplete
is due to the presence on the border of
the National Guard of a number of
states. The soldiers are permitted to
vote by mall, their ballots being for
warded to the auditors of their home
counties, and in Minnesota especially
the vote of the guardsmen is likely to
cut a figure in determining whether the
state goes into the Wilson or the
Uughes column.
Mlinnesota was as bad as California
in the matter of shifts, and as its dele
gation is nearly as large, It, too, was
watched with the intensest interest.
Through days and nights of counting,
the race was a see-saw, with but a
thousand or so of votes separating the
candidates. Neither sidle would ad
mit defeat, and even now, both are
awaiting the soldier vote and the offi
cial count.
New Hampshire a Surprise.
Perlhaps the most surprising of all
the states was New Htampshire. It
alone of all New Engl:and failed to give
the itepublican cnndidate a sulbstantial
plurality, and for dlays no one knew
in whiich column it wouldl land. The
:istonisingi closeness of the vote was
-hown by the rival claims, three days
after the election, of 100 plurality for
Hughes and S-1 for Wilson. In the cir
cunistances it Is no wonder that the
managers ot both parties slioull de
mand it recount.
New Mlexico, with three electoral
votes, attracted national uttentionI by
placing itself early in the list of dtoubt
ful states, and as it soon appeared that
almost every electoral vote would be
vital, the returns from down on the
border were grabbed hot off the wires.
After veering back and forth for days
New Mexico was definitely placed in
the Wilson column, though there, too.
the president's margin was so scant
that a basis was afforded for the call
for a recount. A few mistakes dis
covered in the figures of the Ireccinct
officials might well swing the state
over to Hughes.
Willcox Demands Recount.
On Friday National Chairman WIll
<ox of the Republican party handed
out the following statement:
"The result still depends upon the
vote in a few close states. It must be
borne In mind that the returns thus
fjir announced are, In most states, un
official, and may be clainged by the
official count required by the Ilws of
those states.
"Twice during these unotficlal com
putatIons yesterday In Californint ais
takes in additions were unnoun'ceti
from that state, substantitll3- chauiginig
igur'es previously given.
"'It is a common elpe'rience that the
result of the official count ullmnost al
ways varies from the returns first an
counced.
"Where the vote is as close as that
reported in several states, it amy well
be that material changes will result
trom the ofit ,aL count.

How Congress Stands.
With returns missing from only one
congresslonal district in the United
States, the Republicans and Deimo
crauts each had elected 215 representa
tives.
The vote in New' Mexico, which is
still in doubt, probably will determine
which party is to have a plurality of
one over tlhe other. The present liem
ber from New Mexico is a tRepulll
can.
The balance of power in the next
houise will be held by four men, one
a Progressive 'Protectionist fronm
Louisana. one an indeplenldent from
Malssaclhusetts, one a P'rogressive froml
Minnesota andl the other a Socialist
from New York.
The action of these llemlblers up
pairently will determiine the choliice of
a speaker. Ias well as the fate of legis
lation which is suppllollrtedl or ollpposedI
on purely party lies.
The senate retiniis unchlianged. 54
Demnocrats to 42 Iltmpullieins; a DIemno
cratic majority of 1'.
In addition to the iihope of electing
a congresslman at large from Ni\\
Mexico, the Demlocrat't had tone grami
of comfort. It was that tn offticial
count may disclose that Thomas .1.
Scully has been re-elected from the
third New Jersey district.
An unusaul feature of the result is
the election of the first woman to con
gress, Miss Jeanette Itunkin, Repub

in Montana.

Several parishes are not included in I
these figures because no returns have
been received.
The total vote is far lighter in the I
country than in New Orleans, and in 1
some of the parishes a majority ofº
the voters failed to mark the ballots
for some reason or other. The parishes
voted with the city on only four
amendments, No. 1, abolishing the fee
system for salaries; No. 2, increased
Spensions for Confederate veterans, and
No. 12, the New Orleans bridge.
The largest vote cast was on
Amendment No. 2. The returns from
the parishes, scattering and full, Indi
cate that about two-thirds of them
Went against this system and one
third for it. It is possible that all the
conrressional districts, except the
Pirst and Second (the city districts)
I have returned adverse majorities. al
their h .some of them will he small.
''nents of the Third Louisiana
district have filed a protest with the
secretary of state against promulga
tion of the election for Congress in
I the Third district, where Wade O.
· Martin, Democrat, opposed Represen
s tive Whit P. Martin, Progressive.
' The protest alleges irregularities in
La.Fourche parish, that in several pre
cincts there were not the required
number of commissioners at the
booths and that eight precincts failed
to send official returns to the Board
of Election Supervisor5.
Secretary of State Dailey said he is
without authority to decide the contro
Tersy and that the contest probably
will go before Congress. On the face
of unofficial returns Martin had a ma
I jority of 91 votes in the district.
