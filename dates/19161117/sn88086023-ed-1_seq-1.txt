WATER LOST FROM
LEAKS WILL NOW
BE CHARGED FOR,
After January 1 the water commis
sion will charge full price for all wa
ter lost through leakage, A resolution
to this effect was passed at the reg
ular meeting of the commission this
week.
Heretofore, when consumers have
had large b'lls caused by unknown
leaks In their pipes, the commission
has perm'lted Superintendent Hayes
to rebnte half of the Mil over the min
imum. The practice worked very well
for a time but It Is said that some
consumers took advantage of the
practice. As a matter of protection
to the city the comlsslon decided to
bandon the practice. Exceptions
may be made in extreme cases where
the leakage is properly verified by a
plumber.
Don't place too much confidence In

BEST WISDOM IS
KIND THAT TAKES
HOME 'THEBACON'
SAN FRANCISCO. Cal Nov 17.--"The
only wisdom that counts is the
wisdom that 'brings home the bacon,"
said Samuel O. Blythe, well known
political writer, In a telegram to a
friend congratulating him on Califor
nia's vote In the recent election.
Gavin MvNab had wired Blythe:
"The wise men who came out of
the east settled In the west Wherein
consists their wisdom. Which la prov.
ed by the election returns."
Blythe answered:
"Admitting there is substance in
what you say, I hold you the wisest
of all wise men of the west. I congrat.
ulate you, not on your wisdom, for
nature endowed you with that, but on
the exempllflcat'on of It. The only
wisdom that counts Is the wisdom thai
brings home the bacon."
