1917 State
Legislature
RECORD TASKS WILL HAVE
TO BE FACED
Railroad Fares, Wet and Dry
Legislation, Tonnage Tax, Anti-.
Injunction Act All Looming Up
Lansing, Nov. 13. The 1917 legis
lature, chosen at the polls last week
Tuesday, will face more difficult legis
lative problems than any of its pre
decessors, and unless all signs fail, the
next session of the solons will be the
most important the state has ever seen.
Wet and dry legislation, which is just
now engaging the public mind, ap
parently, will be among the least of the
legislature's troubles, which include
another effort by the railroads to boost
passenger rates, efforts by the Grange,
real estate dealers and the Michigan
Federation of Labor to put through
laws started by initiatory petitions, and
last.but by no means leat will come
the wrestle with the rising total of ap-
' -ropriations.
- .M
I UK lUMSAUh I A A LAW.
Vhe Grange is getting initiative sig-
' natures to a tonnage tax law, the old
bone of contention in Michigan legis
lative politics, which has aopeared alt
most every session as a "bogey man"
but which has never faced the music of
an open vote on the floor. Officers of
the Grange insist that election day they
collected what they think are plenty
signatures and wiil have their petitions
ready to file with the secretary of state
about the middle of December, a
prescribed by the constitution.
TORRENS HILL PROPOSED.
I The real estate men, in conjunction
with the Gra-ige, have petitions out to
initiate the Torrens system of land
transfers, another law which has been
kicked about from pillar" to post ever
since the advent of what can be termed
"progressive" legislation, it got into
the legislature last year for a time, but
was pulled out again. This time its
sponsors insist it will go through and
they say they will hae the votes to
back it up. This bill will receive the
condemnation of every title and abstract
man in the state, for it practically
abolishes their business.
LABOR UNIONS AT WORK.
The Michigan Federation of Labor is
at work initiating an anti-injunction bill
similar to that passed by the democratic
congress at Washington. This promises
a real fight between the labor unions
and their opponents in the house and.
the senate. There have been rumors
that the required number of signatures
were not being sec red by this law,
but the union officials say otherwise.
'esday's election, in bringing about
the defeat of Marshall Oakley, member
of the house from Hay county, deprived
the unions of one of their hardest fight
ers and the man who in all probability
would haye led the fight for the bill on
the floor of the house.
RAILROAD RATE RAISE.
Cut beyond the promised initiated
measures there will be several others
which will cause splits, most notable of
which is the bill to raise the minimum
railroad fare from two - cents a mile,
either to two and one-half cents or to
three cents. This proposition was de
feated in 1015 by the bare margin of
half a dozen votes, and now that their
avowed and arch e'nemy, Grant Fellows
has been placed on the supreme bench,
where he cannot direct a legislative
fight, the railroads apparently think
that they can win. Merlin Wiley, mem
ber from Chippewa county, who led
the fight in the house against the raise
in pnluc i Q t'otnrnnrl o n H ic av rwfictA tr
appear in his former role.
RAILROADS "LOOKED 'EM OVER."
On this proposed bill, although there
has been no definite statement from the
railroads that they were going to make
. the attempt again, nearly everybody at
the capitol is aware that another move
;u to be made. A sort of co-operative
scheme has been in operation since the
legislature adjourned, and the candi
dates before the polls Tuesday were
given a good "look over" by the rail
roads, just as the Michigan anti-saloon
league did on the wet and dry question.
LIQUOR LEGISLATION.
On the liquor legislation, there is no
apparent plan by either side yet in
, , sight, nor can anyone begin to tell what
th.complexion of the senate is. The
house is known to be dry, but the
standing of several of the members of
the senate is unknown here, 'chiefly
because pf democratic upsets in several
districts. While it is thought that the
entire legislature will vote to place the
state-wide amendment in operation,
and provide the proper laws for so do
ing, the proposition of making the state
dry by a statutory provision before the
amendment becomes operative, as has
been snggested as a possibility, is an
other matter. The people at the capitol
figure that such a law would throw a
legislator's individual opinion into the
case too much, and that he would not
be bound to follow the votes of his
district on the dry side of th"e fence.
FRATERNAL INSURANCE.
Fraternal insurance, which was one
of the features of the 1915 session, is
sure to bob up' again, while some at
tempts are going to be made to repeal
the anti-discrimination insurance bill
passed in 1915. This, from all indica
tions, will be a bitter fight. While the
last session passed the bill by . a big
margin most of the opposition to it has
sprung up since its passage. Its consti
tutional standing is now in review by
the courts and by the time the legis
lature meets it may either have been
sustained or killed. t
The automobile tax law, toe, is going
to be the center of many attacks.
All in all, the session of the legis
lature for 1917 promises to be one of
the busiest sessions that ever heppened.
The fact that there will be almost fifty
per cent of new faces in both houses
makes for an uncertainty which may
not be cleared up until after the solons
have been on the job for some time.
MICHIGAN WILL
BE "DRY" IN REALITY
With the adoption of the amendment j
calling for statewide prohibition this 1
state, in eighteen months will enter up
on a long period of "dryness" insofar
as liquor tor beverage purposes is con
cerned. The Webb-Kenyon law relative to the
importation of liquor into dry states,
which attempted to give the dry states
authority to shut off the mail-order
business through state legislation, is up
before the supreme court for decision
as to its constitutionality. Should the
decision favor the law, as it is predict
ed it will, Michigan can indeed be made
"dry."
To add to the strength of those desir
ing the driest of dry states, the more
rabid liquor interests now assert that
they will do all in their power to make
the state absolutely dry. This they
propose to vent their spite and also
through the false belief that a f illy
dry state will react against prohibition.

'BUSINESS
By Berton Braley
"Business is business," but men are men,
Loving and working, dreaming,
Toiling with pencil or spade or pen,
Roistering, planning, scheming.
"Business is business," but he's a fool
Whose business has'grown to smother
His faith in men'and the golden rule,
His lovefor a.friend and brother.
"Business is business," but life is life;
Though we're all in the game to win it
Let's rest sometimes from the heat and strife
And try to be friends a minute.
Left seek to be comrades nowand then,
And slip from our golden tether;
"Business is business," but men are men,
And we're all gdod palstogcther!

SHERIFF NABS MEN
GUILTY OF ILLEGAL
FISHING IN PINE LAKE
Charlevoix Courier Rumors of ille
gal fishing on Pine Lake have stirred
the hearts of true lovers of clean sport
and fair play for several years, but it
remained for these rumors to be sub
stantiated last Thursday evening, when
the depredators were caught, almost
red handed.
Two members of tha.ChaTlevoix Rod
and Gun club received a quiet tip Sun
day that certain persons had been net
ting on Pine Lake for several nights
past and that on the evening in ques
tion they were about to again lift their
nets. The two promptly went to look
up the skipper of the game warden's
boat then lying in this port and found
the boat tied to the warf and the cap
tain, Charles Smith, absent at his home
near Wajloon Lake. Positive from the
accuracy of their information that the
offenders might be rounded up then
and there if quick action were taken,
they got Sheriff Charles Novak to take
the case and Charley promptly started
for the scene of action with Sam Hamil
ton and George Swailes, Hamilton and
Swailes running the game boat and
Charley towing behind in a rowboat.
After lying in the channel near the
Pere Marquette bridge for some time a
boat came to view on Pine Lake, and
Novak and his party watched Its opera
tions for some little time. Finally the
poachers headed for shore, upon which
Novak slipped his tow line and crept
quietly upon them with the row boat,
taking care to keep in the shadows as
much as possible. When they docked
their boat, Charley flashed his pocket
light and discovered William Duba and
a companion. When asked they vigor
ously denied having any fish, but by
this time the others had come up with
the warden's boat and boarding the
poachers' craft discovered about 200
lbs of fish many undersizer whitefish
with a liberal sprinkling of rainbow
and steelhead trout.
So completely had the two been
taken by surprise that they had no
time to dump their catch overboard as
the sheriff feared they might. The
boat and its crew were taken into cus
tody to be turned over to Deputy
Warden Smith on his return. Duba,
when questioned, told conflicting
stories, saying that he had brought the
fish with him from East Jordan, then
resersing himself to say that he was
taking the ,fish to that place. Young
Potter, a fisherman who had accom
panied Duba on a previous expedition
in Lake Michigan the preceding Satur
day, claimed that their entire catch on
that occasion had been turned over to
him as wages.

J
Sleeper Tells
Of His Plans
TO ENFORCE PROHIBITION
REGULATIONS
Self-Supporting Prisoners, More
Orphanages, Goods Roads
And Farm Schools
Mr. Sleeper is discussing his guber
natorial policies declared that he would
iend every energy to assist the law
makers and law enforcers of Michigan
to enforce the provisions of the prohi
bition amendment.
He dwelt upon his policies which he
hopes to carry out while at Lansing.
These policies summarized, are:
Not more laws but more law enforce
ment is needed.
A budget system and energetic en
forcement of its provisions.
Self-supporting prisons.
Reformatories for youths between
sixteen and twenty-one and careful
classification of prisoners in all penal
institutions.
More orphanages for children be
tween eight and twelve years old. .
Good roads, to be repaired by the
state which would charge the upkeep
to the townships.
District schools for farmers to study
scientific farming.
Discussing his campaign Mr. Sleeper
declared that he did not make a single
set political -speech and that most of his
efforts were talks which lasted only a
few minutes.
VAN PELT'S TOURING DIARY
Rutland, Vermont,
Saturday, Sept. 30, 1916.
The week's touring has come to an
end where we are in one of the places
where I sold flour as a travelling sales
man over fifty years ago. It's the same
high license town it used to be. I guess
it has always been so. A drunken man
was going out the door as I was going
in. This beats our town, because he
could go to a place where it was public
ly sold. Although this is one of the
original ."Maine Liquor Law" states, I
think there is more rum drunk here
than any I know of, unless it is Maine.
This a. m. we rested, wrote postal cards
and saw a little of Burlington. It's one
of the prettiest towns in the state. After
dinner, we took a short drive of seventy
miles to Rutland. It seemed to me that
the clouds were never more beautiful,
a sort of a dark lavender, the sky in
the east showing the cold, gray steely
autumn cast which enveloped the
mountains on the east, contrasting with
the bright clouds in the west with the
edges cut clear and distinct, permitting
the sun to cast rts rays here and there
on the mountains in the west. I cannot
imagine why anyone should leave this
part of the country for another Fred
Meech, for instance. I passed his old
home this p. m. and all along the road
tho views were beautiful. Whole
Steine cattle 1 mean not stein of beer
were grazing peacefully in the fields
and gave us a quiet feeling for. our
selves, and a wish for the same for
fellow man.
It's Saturday night, and that means
tub night. We have had a very pleas
ant day. The expense of a trip of this
kind staggers me. Hotels on the Ameri
can plan and frpm $4.00 to $5.00 per
day. Gasoline, 25c. We average fif
teen miles per gallon of gas. We use
the Goodyear tires firsts only, when
we can get them. With these, we have
already reeled off G195 miles and one
has the original air that we started with
still in it. So far, in Vermont, we have
had only gravel roads and we of Char
levoix County know that when new
they are good. They use a scraper a
good deal and keep the sides of the
road smooth and the ruts filled. This
can be done by frequent use and one
man and a team can keep a long strelch
in order going from his home up one
side and returning on the opposite side.
In this country, efficiency is the order
of the day.
Trusting you are all as well and as
happy as I am, I still remain a true and
loyal member of the Charlevoix County
Booster Club.

HEARD AT THE '
NATIONAL CAPITAL
Washington, Nov. 15. (Special Cor
respondence) Whatever explanations
may be made by those interested, the
fact is indisputable that the army pre
paredness act of the Wilson administra
tion has been a miserable failure. Un
der the old law the maximum authoriz
ed strength of the army was 113,504,
and there was then an actual strength
of 80,607. The new law authorized an
emergency increase of 20,000 and made
changes in the law which were design
ed to increase enlistments. In the last
thirteen months only 12,050 men have
enlisted and the strength is now placed
at 99,257, or 14,307 below the authorized
strength of the old law and more than
34,000 below the maximum of the. new
law. The fact probably is that in spite
of the strenuous efforts made by the
administration to persuade men to en
list, there has been such general lack
of confidence .in the Wilson manage
ment of military affairs that compara
tively few men cared to enlist, even
when they had the inducement of ac
tive service.
In his last speech of the campaign,
President Wilson made one admission
which received no public attention but
which is of vast importance, in view
of the tendency toward government
ownership. Discussing the enlarge
ment of the service of the Department
of Agriculture, he said that "the whole
process has illustrated a very note
worthy and interesting fact, the stimu
lation and development come from out
side the government rather than from
inside the departments." This is one
of the most serious objections to govern
ment ownership. .In the government
service there is no encouragement' for
individual effort. This has been es
pecially true under the Wilson admin
istration. Men in the ranks in the
different departments see no incentive
to extra effort and no reward for spe
cially valuable service, for the higher
positions are frequently filled by men
of no experience and with no claim to
recognition except the political service
they have rendered in the past.
Because there is little prospect of re
ward for real merit in government ser
vice, under the policies pursued by an
administration such as this, men who
are really ambitious to serve the coun
try effectively, soon lose their interest
and fall into ruts. As President Wil
son admits, the development and the
stimulation come from outside the de
partments. And so it will be under
government ownership of telephone,
telegraph, and railroad systems, if the
government ever commits itself to the
ownership and operation of these utili
ties. '
Southern Democrats are not at all
pleased with the manner in which
Attorney General Gregory issued state
ments regarding intimidation of voters,
just before election. This was design
ed, of course, to create the impression
that the intimidation existed in Repub
lican circles, and in Northern States.
Mr. Gregory declared his intention to
vigorously prosecute infractions of the
law against intimidation. He overlook
ed the fact that the only part of the
country where there is open and whole
sale intimidation is in the South where
practically half the voting population
does not dare go near the polls on elec
tion day. It is quite evident that when
Mr. Gregory begins his prosecutions,
he will be impressively reminded of
conditions in the section of the.couhtry
from which he hails, and he will be re
minded of his official obligation to en
force the law impartially.
It is reported in army circles that
strong recommendations will be made
in the forthcoming annual reports for
the abandonment of the army horse
and mule and the substitution of the
motor tractor for the hauling of heavy
artillery. It is claimed that the cost of
maintenance will be much less, as the
motor requires little expense when not
in use, vyhile the horse must be fed and
stabled at all times. Moreover, it is as
serted that a tractor will turn a heavy
gun in a shorter space than the teams
necessary in handling heavy guns.
A quiet wedding may be but the calm
before the storm.
It isn't at all likely that a woman will
ever discover that she's beautiful if she
waits for another woman to tell her.
Men may be as deceitful as women in
some things, but no man ever pretend
ed to be having a good time when he
wasn't.
"Contentment abides with the truth"
says the old adage, but very few men
are in a position to vouch for the truth
of it.
School Commissioner's
Notes
May L. Stewart, Commissioner
M. S. T. A. in Grand Rapids the best
yet!
Just think we have been blaming it
all to the teachers because 50 per cent
of the eighth graders fail to pass the
eighth grade examination and the as
sistant state superintendent says part
of this is due to the poorly lighted
school rooms from which the students
come.
' Study the school plant, teachers, work
it wisely and well. ' If the system is
new you may need advice but keep the
right track.
One of the state supervisors asks,
Are you following a system found in
the course of study or one original with
yourself? Are you following a system
with ways and means or just ways and
means?"
And the big plea was for proper and
hygienic seating, for adequate ventila- ,
tion, and for workable interiors.
A fine compliment was paid to one
of our county teachers by the assistant
state superintendent in his address to
the county normal principals, when he
stated that we had here a man who
preferred to teach but one year in a
place but to leave that school much
better than he found it. He condemned
all who took things as they found them
and let well enough alone but found a
notable exception to this in the teacher
who is worth while.
Mr. Munson, deputy superintendent,
called for specimens ,of penmanship
from every county normal class last
spring. I wonder if this would be a
good plan to follow out in the rural
schools.
Miss Kerry sends word that the
Pleasant Valley School has received its
prize money from the Fair Association
and will buy a drinking fountain. .
Miss Johnson sends word that the
Deer Lake School is sure going to have
some fine new seats.
Miss Benson writes that the Miles
School raised $12 in a social and will get
a new desk and chair for teacher. Sure
ly needed for there was neither in
existence. I wonder, do little children
ever get tired when their feet dangle
five inches from the floor?
A little black cat brought an invita
tion to this office to a Hallowe'en Social
at the Mountain School, admission one
cent. Sorry that the institute interfered.
If you had a basement furnace in
your school house and it sent the same'
air up to the children reheated and re
hashed fifty times each day, say, what
would you do?
The Hume Work idea will be studied
by the commissioners of the state this
winter and reported on at a later meet
ing for possible state wide adoption. A
"University professor gave a splendid
paper on this subject which met with
universal favor among the educators.
