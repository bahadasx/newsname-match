NEW LONDON, Conn., Nov. 17. Five lives were lost when the I
German submersible merchantman Deutschland, which left port at
an early hour this morning for Bremen, rammed and sent to the
bottom with her crew of five the tng Tascott Jr., one of the two
convoying tugs. After the accident the Deutschland returned to
port.
The collision occurred alout one mile inside the race, and,
according to members of the Deutschland 's crew, came "in a
minute."
The tug, it is said, got in front of the Deutschland, the distance
being so slight between them that the submersible had no chance
to avoid an accident. The nose of the Deutschland struck the tug
near the stern and lifted it well out of water, sending the tug's
nose under. Almost immediately afterwards the boilers of the tug
exploded, the vessel sinking with all aboard.
The Deutschland, apparently, was not seriously damaged, and it
is said she probably will be ready to sail in a few days, when
repairs have been made. Several bow plates were bent and rivets
loosened, but the interior was not damaged. The crew will make
the repairs.
The submarine and tug came together on a comparatively smooth
sea, and when it was apparent that the tug was fatally rammed
the crew jumped. Captain Hindi of the Eastern Forwarding com
pany KHuin to a life preserver thrown out from the Deutschland.
The Deutschland drew out of her pocket 'at the pier at 1 :30
o'clock this morning, accompanied by two tugs, the Tascott and
the Cassic. She carried for the homeward dash a cargo valued at
zWSiiTBSoiir

$2,000,000, consisting of nickel, rubber and silver bars. The trip
dewn the harbor was without incident, and, when last seen from
the newspaper launch, the submersible was plowing through a
sn.ooth sea at a speed of twelve knots. ,
Captain Koenig of the Deutschland appeared pale and shaken
when he stepped ashore from the vessel on its return after the
accident. lie refused to talk about the collision.
(By Aaaoclatcd lrr, )
NEW LONDON, Conu., Nov. 17. An "eddy" caused the acci
dent, according to Captain Harty Baker of the tug Cassie, the other
convoy for the submersible. The Deutschland is expected to be
ready to sail in two or three days. -
The sea was calm, Baker said, and conditions normal. The tide
was running almost full, and when seven miles west of Race rock
they struck an eddy which twisted the tug and submarine about and
out of control. Shortly afterward they came together. The night
wns clear, he said, and there were no other boats about beside the
two tugs and the submarine. He gave no credence to the reports of
a hostile motorboat approaching the submarine at the time of the
accident.

WW '
Before leaving for his home In San
Francisco yesterday, Herman Zadig,
the mine maker and broker, talked
optimistically wllth a Bonanza repre
sentative. He said:
"I visited the Rescue yesterday
morning and was very much pleased
with the showing on the 950 level.
This wss at one time called the foot
wall crosscut. It la now the eaBt
drift. It shows a face of ore that
U seven feet In width and runs $21
to the ton, according to car sam
ples. As the walls are not In sight.
there la no telling how wide the ore
la. This ore la of a different char
acter from what wo have had before.
It Is how oxidized and la higher in
ol4 than what waa previously ex
posed. It la perhapa too early to
prophesy what the ore body will de
velop into, but any mining man who
will go down and view the working
will see the making of a big ore
body. We have 1200 feet to go to
reach our lineal boundary. I can
only say that the present price of
this security is ridiculously low and
am advising all my friends to take
advantage of the present low price. -"There
Is an excellent showing not
alone on the 950, but on the 1050
winze, where sweeting II being ob
, tained, and particularly on the
eleventh level, whfch la a crosscut
Into the Maggie May claim. This is
looking exceedingly well and I expect
that any blast now will show the
downward continuation of the ore
that we have on the 950 level. The
formation Is decidedly better on the
1100 than we have on the 950, being
a highly silicifled trachyte. Other
places In the mine are looking well
and the usual tonnage la being pro
duced, and with the continued rise In
silver I see great profits.
"I also visited the North Star and
I don't believe that ever since I have
been connected with the company
have I seen ' It look more promising
for the development of a big body of
ore, for the reason that the work we
are doing on the 1050 shows a fine
body of trachyte and Is on the far
side ot the Mlzpah fault, the ore
Producing fracture In the district. It
U in a large acreage of ground that
hitherto has been unexplored. We
are taking out some ore between the
900 and the 850 levels and occasion
ally get some very high grade. Thia
helps to sweeten up the low grade.
"I am also watching with a great
deal of Interest the developments in
of value to the North Star .because
our drift on the 1200 Is, if I remem
ber right, within 100 feet of the
Gypsy .line.
'Tonopah certainly has a great
future. Much new work haa been
started and heavy development Is In
progress. With the prospect for the
advance in silver I look for lively
times ahead for this camp. I be
lieve silver will be selling for 80
cents by the end ot the year and that
it will be $1 or more when the war
ends.
"I think Silver Pick Is the property
that will put a new Ooldfleld on the
map. The work that we have done
there proves that ore bodies can
exUt west of the Columbia mountain
fault. We have passed through
values exceeding $200. I am willing
to put myself on record to this fact,
We had not only ore In the shaft, but
In the drill hole 450 feet to the west.
When we commence to drift and
crosscut we expect to develop one ot
the big mines of Ooldfleld. I leave
hoping to be called back shortly by
news of a big strike either in Tono
pah or Ooldfleld, and I do not feel
privileged to say where I expect the
lightning to strike."

$5,000,000 10;
GO TO GH WR
(By Aaaoclated Prm.) i
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17. A loan
of $5,000,000 gold has been made by
the Continental and Commercial Na
tional bank of Chicago to the Chinese
government through its minister here,
Dr. y. K. Wellington Koo.
Loans to China, particularly through
New York bankers, not only have
been repeatedly negotiated for during
the past year, but have been re
garded as essential to China's con
tinued freedom from revolution. Offi
cials at Peking have conceded the
fact that there has been a pressing
need for money to meet the heavy
expenses of the government and ot
a very large standing army. Euro
pean bankers have been unable to
raise funds for China and American
bankers heretofore have refused
either because of the better rates of
interest in Europe, lack of security
offered by China or the withdrawal
of the American government's sup
port from the original six power
group.
Last spring the American Interna
tional corporation tentatively offered
$5,000,000 advance on the reconstruc
tion of the Grand canal and later con
sidered seriously the suggestion for a
loan of $30,000,000, with an advance
of $4,000,000 to be mad through the
state department. This deal never
was consummated. China then turned
to Japan, completing a loan of
$5,000,000.
This loan caused great bitterness
in China and nearly precipitated a
ministerial crisis. Another Japanese
loan of $16,000,000 was Just about to
be concluded when Japan's demand
because ot the clash of troops at
Cheng Chiatung broke oft the nego
tiations. ;
On September 21, Finance Minister
Chen Chin Tao announced China's
desire to arrange a $50,000,000 loan
through the qulntiple group ot Ameri
can, English, French, . Russian and
Japanese bankers, but nothing came
of it. Two weeks later cams the
announcement that the Slema-Cary
company of St Paul had secured a
concession from China to build about
1500 miles ot railroad and reconstruct
part of the Grand canal at a cost of
about $60,000,000. '
Mr. Reynolds said that his 'bank
had the present loan under considera
tion during several months of ex
haustive investigation ot the re
sources and credit ot China.
