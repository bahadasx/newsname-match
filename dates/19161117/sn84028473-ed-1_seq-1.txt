MOTHER LOVE
So long as 90 women beg for tho

love that finds Its highest level In the

arms to any chjld that needs It when
deprived of Its natural maternal
guardianship The rush of 90 women
in a Western city to become the foster-mother
to one baby argues and
pioves its own case children depriv
ed of their duo by misfortune will be
protected while there are any women
alive
Instincts that havo been growing

The struggle of SO women Jot one
