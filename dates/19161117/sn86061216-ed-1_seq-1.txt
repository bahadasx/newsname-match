PUZZLING POLICE
PONTIAC, ILL., AUTHORITIES PER
8IST IN BELIEF THAT GIRL
WAS SLAIN.
Pontiac, 111., Nov. 16.—The estab
lishment of a motive for the death of
Miss Christine Diemer, in connection

and former county supervisor, her
mother, and her sister are.being held,
occupied the attention of the authori
ties here today.
State'e Attorney F. A. Ortman con
tinued his investigation 6f evidence
upon which one or all members of the
family may be,held to the grand jury
on the charge of murder.
It was admitted that the baffling
point about the case was almost com
plete lack of a plausible motive for the
alleged murder of the girl, whose body
was found in the Vermillion river a
week ago.
Diemer, his wife and daughter, Mag
dalena, continued thleir denials that
Christine had been fnurdered and the
theory of suicide was emphasized.. A
development was a statement attribut
ed to Magdalena that Christine's will,
disposing of about $2,000 in cash and
personal property, had been drawn in
her favor, but at the same time she
declared that she had not wanted the
money.
A pair of muddy, water soaked shoes
figure in an investigation being made
by County Treasurer W. M. Patterson,
'former sheriff. Mr. Patterson came
upon the shoes on the back porch. Mag
dalena Diemer, Christine's sister, ac
cording to Patterson, said she wasn't
sure, but thought that the shoes were
several days before
placed in the river.
Consideration will be given to re
commending further cooperation by
business Interests with the movement

GERMANS RESENT
CHARGE OF BRITISH
SUBMARINE COMMANDER DENIES
HAVING FIRED ON ROWAN
MORE'S LIFE BOATS.
Berlin, Nov. 15.—(By wireless to
the Associated Press, via Sayville,
Nov. 16.)—Assertions that the German
submarine which sank the British ship
Rowanmore, on which there were sev
eral Americans, fired upon life boats
containing members of the crew are
dismissed as utterly false in the report
of the commander of the submarine,
further details of which became known
todjiy.
In fact, it Is said, the men on the
Rowanmore owe their lives to the pre
cautions taken by the Germans and
the skiil with which their operations
were carried out.
During the twenty minute pursuit
of the steamship the submarine's shots
were aimed accurately astern to limit
the danger to the crew, which was con
gregated at the bow.
.The master of the Rowanmore at
tempted to justify his attempt to es
cape, the submarine commander re
ports, by saying he desired to gain
time to launch boats but this pretext
was not accepted. Later the Rowan
more's captain was made a prisoner of
war for attempting to escape and for
summoning assistance by wireless,
which speedily brought up a British
destroyer. Thereupon the Rowan
more was sunk by a torpedo.
There were two white Americans
and five Filipinos in the crew of the
Rowanmore, all of whom were saved.
Last month the American government
made an informal request to the Ger
man government for information in re
gard to the Rowanmore case.

BELIEVE LITTLE
Court Officials Think That
Jeruchemsohn Boy Merely
Rode With Young Brady
Further investigation into the alleg
ed stealing of horses by Everett Brady,
10-year-old lad, will not be made until
Monday morning, November 27.
This was decided by District Judge
D. M. Anderson today after young
Brady had been brought before him for
questioning. With the Brady young
ster today was Solomon Jeruchem
sohn, aged 7 years, who Brady at first
said was implicated in the crimes but
who has now been exonerated from
any connection except that he went for
a ride with Brady in one of the rigs
supposed to have been stolen by the
10-year-old.
While still being held answerable to
the court's call the officers do not con
sider that there is any evidence
against young Jeruchemsohn which
will connect him directly with the
crime.
Stories told by the Brady boy, which
vary almost every time he tells them,
would indicate that he has knowledge
of the tbeft of six head of horses from
different parts of the city during the
past fifteen days.
Frank Darner, from whose barn one
of the alleged thefts is said to have
occurred, denies that horse or harness
were taken from his barn.
The Brady boy's mother has arrived
from Davenport and he has been al
lowed to leave the county jail and re
main in her custody until time for his
hearing.
