"Wilson Construes Re-election
as Indorsement by People
of Previous Course.
Washington, Nov. 13.?President
Wilson, back in the Whate House for
the first time since the campaign began
two months ago, plunged into
work today in an effort to clear his
desk of accumulated business. Taking
for granted that he had been reelected,
he asked no questions about
electoral votes but did display anxiety
over the political complexion of
ihe next house of representatives.
Through an interview with Secretary
Lansing the president got in
touch with pressing foreign problems,
including the submarine, Mexican
and British blockade issues; and
In a talk with Henry Morganthau.
chairman of the finance committee of
the Democratic national committee,
he became acquainted with the latest
developments in the political situation.
State department officials make no
secret of their belief that dangerous
possibilities are presented by recent
developments in both the Mexican
and submarine questions. . Secretary
Lansing reviewed details with Mr.
Wilson today but said no. immediate
action was In prospect. Some development
is expected soon, however,
at the American-Mexican conference
sitting at Atlantic City.
No Radical Changes.
It was stated definitely by officials
in the conference of the president today
that his re-election will mean no
ft radical changes in any of his policies.
^He is said to feel that in general his
course has been Indorsed by the nation
at the polls. Consequently the
administration's policy, both in domestic
and foreign affairs, it is predicted,
will remain practically un.
, changed although as soon as the war
*' is over the president will recommend
a revision of the tariff if he feels it
is Justified by the fncts to be gathered
by the new tariff commission,
With regard to foreign affairs, it
was said today that the government'"
attitude toward submarine warfare
inid down in the note -following the
sinking of the Sussex and in previous
communications will be followed
strictly and the state department will
continue to press for American rights
in connection with the allied blockade
and mail censorship.
If a satisfactory agreement can be
reached for the protection of the
American border and American lives
* and property in Mexico, it is believed
that the United States troops in Mexico
will be withdrawn soon, although
a strong force will be kept
along Ihe border.
A Disturbing Situation.
The confused situation in the State
of Chihuahua and the uncompromising
attitude of Gen. Carranza on
some points, however, are understood
to cause the president to view the
Mexican situation with anything but
composure.
On domestic questions 1>tr. Wilson
has told his friends that as soon as
congress convenes he will press \>i
the remainder of the legislative programme
already out!tned. He has begun
the preparation of his message
to congress. Because of the probability
that the next house will be llc.publlcan
be will seek to get through
as much general legislation as possible
(Juring the short session ending
Mareh 4.
The president is said to desire no
general changes ip, the personnel of
his administration.'. It was stated
definitely today that no cabinet officers
will be asked to resign either
now or next March, although it i-q
possible that one or more may wish
to retire for personal or business
reasons'. Among those Who have
been reported as considering resignation
have been Attorney General
Gregory, Secretary Rtdfleld, Secretary
Baker, Secretary Daniels and
Secretary McAdoo. '
Big Men in Sight.
Venice C. Mccormick, chairman of
"the Democratic national committee,
k and Senator Walah of .Montana, who
had charge of the Western Democratic
headquarters at Chicago, are
understood to have impressed the
president particularly, / and it was
said to be more than likely that in
case tflere should he vacancies In the
cabinet, or in other Important posts.

MR. WYLIE
MAKESJ
Confirms His Statement T
Is To Pay More Than I
by City Council for la
Mr. Editor: Mayor Chas. D. Jones,
n your issue of the 14th instant,
nakes rejoinder to my communlcaion
in the issue of the 11th instant.
\.s he brings out no new matter, anyhing
further on mv nait michf
"egarded as superfluous, yet I will
ouch upon some matters in his last
irticle in order to keep the record
itraight.
He charges me with not denying
:hat I have been animated in this
liscussion by "hostility to certain
members of the city council and to
Pol. Leroy Springs." He says fur:her
that "Mr. Wylie, while not delying
the hostility alleged, now proclaims
that his sole purpose was to
icrve the public interests."
It is evident that Mr. Jones is perlistently
determined to try to place
ne in a false position. In my last
;ommunication will be found the
ilain, terse sentence, in reply to this
rery charge, as follows:
"I DISCLAIM ANY SUCH PURPOSE."
Mayor Jones asks, "Will Mr. Wylie
leny that the article he first intended
to publish contained hurtful inilnuations
against members of the
dty council and that such insinuatto
inuations against members of the city
council and that such insinuations
vere only left out because a friend
>f his advised him that it would not
lo to publish it?" Yes, I deny this
ind will say that the article pubished
by me was the only one I ever
ntended to publish and nothing was
imitted from same on the advice of
iny one whomsoever.
The mayor insists that the "nninous
of Mr. Wylie still shtJws iHfplf.'".
iVehre ij,Tit familiar with this kind or
"critter" styled "anlmdhs," whether
tiped, quadruped, or centipede, he,
ihe, or it. not being defined in the
lictionary.
The mayor says- that tno cgrj.tra'j,
jrpposad by the city council is "To,
supply tire Cotton Mflls, :rs'a single
ustomer, one million gallons of city
water at seventy ?(.$70..ft0) dollar*
l>cr month in accortlance with the
ate ndo'pted in 1908." Tltis is, th<?
rery thing I .am objecting to. This
ate was nfiule to manufacturing
r>lftntsA,\vi1hln the city limits, all of
uhich .pay city taxes, both license"
incl property.: The mayors-will per-haps
remember that both he and 1
1QI* our voices and votes, on two
lieffnct occasions, to bring this same
Cotton Mills within the city limits,
tvhen it would have come under the
rate of 1908, applying to manufacturing
plants within the city limits,
Out the same mill which has twice declined
to share, the burdens of city
lax?$. is not entitled to the same
privileges that the city.tnxpaying e\
tsprprises are entitled to.
mayor says: "He states no
mcts as a basis for bis mere opinion
fliathhe water supply, may be jeopar
Uzerf. by the proposed eontraet." '1

charges the Wylie Cotton Milto, put
he citizens in danger of a -water
famine, or at the mercy of Are, and
ill forsooth because the city owes
Vfr. keroy Springs so much, or for
'ear that his mill might involve the
dty in litigation?
The mayor says I have "not re rained
from stating misleading
'acts" and for instance says I quoted
he domestic rate of Chester, but did
not tell you Chester's manufacturng
rate, which runs as low, on a

graduated scale, as 7 1-2 cents on
80,000 gallons and over. But he
does not state that this manufacturing
rate applies only to manufacturing
plants within the city limits,
just as in Lancaster, and that those
without the city limits, like thej
Wylie Mills, have to pay 15 cents for
all over 10,000 gallonb just as the
Lancaster Cotton Mills should be
made to do If the water is to be furnished.
But what has become of the
VVylie Mill? Dropped from the
mayor's argument like a hot potato.
He Btated that he was "reliably informed"
that it was furnished water
by the city of Chester for 7 1-2 cents
per thousand gallons, which statement
we proved to be incorrect by
inforpiation received from the city
englm^er of Chester, who stated that
the Wylie Mill was to pay the Chester
domestic rate, which is 15 cents
per thousand gallons, for all in excess
of 10,000 gaiions. Again, we
emphasize the fact that the rate
made by Chester to the Wylie Mill Is
more than twice the^tate at which
the Lancaster City Council proposes
to (furnish water to the Lancaster
Cotton Mills.
I
The mayor says I have "not re
fralned from stating misleading
facts which are not instructive to
the public in the discussion of this
issue. For instance he quotes Cherter's
domestic rate up to 10.000 gallons
and over and figures that a
million gallons would cost |152.10,
but does not tell you what Chester's
manufacturing rate is." The mayor
then'-jjroceods"" to give (he manufacturing
rate prevailing in Chester.
? r M
Who first referred to Cheater's
rate to the Wylie Mill? Mayor
Jones. And for what purpose? Kvitlently
to make it appear that thproposed
coptrac^of his council with
the ^Lancaster Cotton Mills was about
the same as Chester's with th<
Wylie Mill.
Tfie mayor says in (lie following
\angifjige. "The Kditor of The News.
Mr fy'ylio, and other critics have
either through ignorance or prejudice
not taken the trouble to thoroughly;
inform .themselves as to the
attitffde of other cities in furnishing

plants." Now note carefully what
follows: I am still quoting the
mayor: "For instance I am reliabl>
informed that the ciiv of Chester is
furnishing to the Wylie Cotton Mills,
which is two miles outside the cor
porate limits, at the rate of 7 1-2.

He says: "Th'' wntUr to J^e used h>

It is never hurtful to take the

of this principle stands Woodrow
Wilson, who counts it-a privilege

I HOPE AGREEMENT
MAY BE REACHED

TO WITHDRAW TROOPS
Settlement Probably Will Include
Removal of American Soldiers
in Three Months.
Atlantic City, N. J., INov. 13.?Afiter
the conference today of the Mexican-American
joint commission, it
, was intimated that an agreement
' nrnviflincr for thn - * 11?
ir- r> luo HHUUIUBIII Ul me
American punitivo expedition might
be reached before the close of the
week.
LuiB Cabrera, chairman of the
Mexican commission, said he believed
a settlement would be reached within
a few days. He went to Philadelphia
again late today, where it is
understood he will confer with Rafaelo
Nieto, sub-secretary of the department
of finance of Mexico, of
which Mr. Cabrera is the head.
Mr. Cabrera announced to the
American commissioners that Gen.
Carranza had extended to January
14 the time given mine owners for
reopening their properties.
In t he event of an agreement being
formed for the withdrawal of the
American troops it probably will not
be stipulated that they be brought
out of Mexico immediately, but that
they be recalled within a reasonable
time, perhaps within 60 or 90 days.
It is believed that the withdrawal at
any time will be made subject to conditions
at that time.
That Gen. Carranza is sincere in
his'efforts to drive Villa and his followers
from the field is not doubted
by the American commissioners, although
they have been keenly interested
in what apparently was the inability
of t he present Mexican army
to accomplish that purpose. News

to succeed Gen. Jacinto Trevino

' LOTS OF ADVANTAGES
President Points to Good Things
in Connection With Training
for Servicfe.
Washington, Nov. 13.?President
W. M. Riggs of Clemson college,
who is in Washington, believes the
students of Clemson have an excellent
opportunity of becoming members
of the reserve officers' training
corps now being considered by
federal authorities here.
"Clemson college would have
everything to gain and nothing tn
lose by entering the senior division
of the resrve officers' training
corps," President Riggs said. "Already
every student is required to
take three hours of military work
per week during his entire course in
college.
"Under the rules governing the
reserve officers' training corps freshmen
and sophomores would still
take, as now, three hours of military
instruction but it would be of a
more varied and interesting character.
Without assuming any additional
obligation whatever, they
iwould receive from the government
one olive drab uniform, to be used
at drill, thus reducing the expense
of gray and blue uniform outfits, and
although not required, would have
the privilege of attending during
their vacations at the expense of the
war department the four weekB*

held last summer at Plattsburg, N.
|y., and elsewhere,

any cadet regarded as fit for further
training by the college president and
the army officer at the college could
'decide for himself whether or not to

to take it he would have to put.
'in two hours of military study in

hours of work he would assume
