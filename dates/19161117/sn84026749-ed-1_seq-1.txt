our day of thanksgiving has been
rich in blessings to us as a people,
but the whole face of the world

In the midst of our peace and
happiness, our thoughts dwell
with painful disquiet upon the
struggles and sufferings of the
nations at war, and of the peoples
upon whom war has brought dis
aster without choice or possibility
of escape on. their part.
We cannot think of our own
happiness without thinking also
of their pitiful distress.

thanksgiving and prayer, and

Fuel Situation Better Than It
Has Been for Weeks,-Say
Officials.
CLIMAX CAME YESTERDAY
One Apartment House Unabe
to Furnish Heat Until 10
. o'clock in Morning.
The coal situation In Washington to
day was brighter than It has been In
several weeks.
Tills Improvement was Indicated by
the arrival of six car loads of soft coal
for delivery to Government departments,
and by Uvo more cor loads for 'the
District building nnd tho schools,
that the situation would be butt?: from
apartments nnd office buildings were
further encouraged by the Weather
Bureau's prediction of warmer weather
tonight and tomorrow.
The coal shortage In Washington, It
became known today, renched Its climax
yesterday. One opartmenf house was
unable to furnish any heat until coal
urrlvcd nt 10 o'clock yesterday morning.
Dwellers Shivered.
Meanwhile tho apartment dwellers
shivered In the coldest morning of the
season, nnd led the rental agent a merry
chnse hy telephones and personal calls.
With tho delivery to the Federal and
District government offices of enough
coal to tide thorn over the rest af this
week, the rontructors gave assurance
Government officials nd manage! of
now on,
Those contractors said they had In
formation from the mines that more
con I would he shipped, and from thtt
rullroHd comjmnk'H Unit shipments would
be expedited.
M. C. Iluigrove, purchasing officer
of the District, said today he had
been told that it Is probnble that
from six to eight curs dally for use
of the schools might be coming In
shortly.
Jiiincs I Wllmeth. chief clerk of the
Treasury, said that he had been In
formed that more coal might be ex
pected from now on.
More Cars in Transit.
Severn1 more cars are In transit
with coal, which will be. delivered to
the schools as soon ns It arrives.
Some dealers report that thev have
cars on the way. but that thev liavo
been delaved In shipment.
Coal dealers rcmulned reticent to
day In the face of t- better condi
tions. Thev have, decided, by com
mon agreement, not to talk about
the shortage of coal, and they pre
served this attitude, even with more
conl arriving.
Mr. Hargrove Iiodcs to receive by
this evening reports on an Inventory
now being taken of the amount of
coal at each school building. Enough
coal la on hand now so that no more
transfers .need be made for a time.
Despite the promise of more cool
from the contractors, bids will be re
ceived by Mr. Hargrove tn Monday.
Thn number of these bids, and the
prices asked, ar exnerted to shed
considerable light on the dealers'
opinion regarding the coal prospects
for the next month,
The six cars of coal for the Gov
ernment, about 300 tons, will be dis
tributed among tho Bureuu of En
graving and Printing, the Agricul
tural Department, tho Treasury, nid

Following the hearings on the valua
tion of tho Capital Traction Company
and Washington Hallway and Kloctrlc
Company properties, a public hearing
will he held by tho Public 'Utilities
Commission on the universal transfer
question.
The conclusion reached by tho com
mission following tho hearing on uni
versal trnnsfers on October f, 1913. was
that It Is a rate question. Tho public
utilities luw provides that upon Its own
Initiative or upon "reasonablo com
plaint" mado agaius a public utility
that any of Its rates aro unreasonable
or unlutftly discriminatory, the com
mission may Investigate, but that no
order affecting rates shall bo entered
without u formal hearing.
Conrad II. Syme. general counsel for
tho commission Is understood to agree
with the opinion of his preccdcssor..the
lato K. H. Thomas, that the act of 1S!M
providing for reciprocal transfers bo
tween tho Metropolitan Railway, now
a port of tho Washington Railway and
Electric Company, and connecting lines
cannot bo construed as requiring uni
versal transfers, ,
It is upon this act thr Federation of

Continues to Grow.
The United States l shipping more
eggs than ever before to Europe.
There are nearly n fourth less eggs In
cold storage now than there were a
year ago.
The price of eggs Is unusually high
for this season. Sixty cents was the
retail price today for fresh eggs.
In tho face of these conditions the
demand for eggs continues unabated,
This combination of circumstances,
many denlcrs freely predict, will bring
"75-cent eggs" by Thanksgiving.
Tho nerslstent demand for eggs, n

This same prosperity works in a "vi
cious circle," for It Is regarded as a
contributory factor In the lessened sup
ply and the consequent high price.
Because higher wages have resulted
in a greater consumption of egita than
usual in this country. In 'addition to the
greater shipments abroad.
Shipment of eggs for tho first elrht
months of this year were worth
13,450.000, while the egg exports for
a similar period In 1914 amounted to
but II, 177,000.

Story of Mysterious Craft's Attempt to Ram

NEW LONDON, Nov. 17. An attempted dash to
sea by the German merchant submarine Deutschland
ended early today In a collision between the super-submersible
and an escorting tug, in which Captain Gunfcy
.and four members of the tug's crew were drowned.
The Deutschland, bound for Bremen, put back to
port immediately after the collision, and by 5 o'clock this
morning was again warped into her pier. She was once
more shielded by the liner Willehad, her "mother ship, '
and the big steel net was swung into place to further guard
her.
Late this morning a report was circulated that a mys
terious motorboat tried to ram the Deutschland, and that,
in attempting to protect the submarine, the tug swung di
rectly in the path of the uridersea freighter.

through snow, sleet, and mud, the four

General Sarrall refused to be drawn

The foil of Monastir will be a dis

Running on Surface.
Tho Deutschland was running on the
surface ot tho tlmo of the accident
While thero was no heavy sea, the cur
rent, according to tho Cassle's crew,
was unusually strong. Because of this
and the Inky darkness, the Deutschland 3
lookout did not sco the Scott quick
enough to sound iin alarm.
All lights that had not been extin
guished were Blinded In order to raake
