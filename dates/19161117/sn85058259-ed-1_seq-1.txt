aAlf T,ake Route Abandons Uin
tah Basin Project in Favor
of This Branch Line.
WILL EXTEND FROM
LUND TO KAIBAB FOREST
An Important and Much Neglected
Section at Last is Promised
Transportation Facilities.
(Salt Lake Herald-Republican.)
Abandonment of the plans of the
Salt Lake Route to extend a branch
line into the Uintah basin was re
ported in railroad circles yesterday to
, be the result of a decision on the part
of the official board of the railroad to
mak" preparations to extend a branch
line down through southern Utah
from Lund as far as the Ktiibab na
j tional forest, touching all important
7 points en route. A survey for the line
H it is reported will be started within
m a few weeks.
l Attorney C. B. Stewart said that the
4,i project of reclaiming more than 40,-
yf 000 acres of semitropical arid land
Si west of Hurricane, Washington coun
sel ty, by establishing a sorie; of storage
ak dams on the Rio Virgin, has been Riv-
3 en new life as the result of indications
X that the Salt Lake Route intends build-
H, ing a southern Utah line. As soon as
Si the railroad starts buildine this line,
Mm it is said, capitalists will be ready to
H invest more than $1,000,000 in the
M Rio Virgen Project.
MM. In addition, numerous timbering
H companies, including the Eccles Lum-
H ber company, and other concerns in
I U., the northwest, are reported to hae
Httjf dispatched their timber rruigors
' make a special inv-'stiuratlon "f the
Oi Kaibab national forest. This, it is
I ' said, is entirely the result of reliable
li assurance that the Salt Lake Route
wf 1. intends building a branch railroad
1 1 down into the Dixi country.
II The forest service departnv tit nn-
1 nounced more than two years ago that
1 the timber in the Kaibab national for-
l est had matured, was ready for rut-
T ting and would be sold to the highest
F bidder.
1 Immediately after the announce-
B ment speculation became rife of the
l building of a railroad branch line to
1 that section. It is said that predic-
' tions that the road would be built by
1 the Salt Lake Route are now about to
41 materialize.
f Saya It Will Pav.
1 "The building of a railroad down
ILo through southern Utah from Lund will
If " result In the establishment of one of
V the best pavinir branch lines in the
-4 west," said Dr. Ernest Green of Cedar
-' M City, during a visit in Salt Lake. "The
Mr buildine of a steam railroad will meun
, g the extension of electric lines.
J While a branch line extended south
1 from Lund would penetrate the most
Jf extensive iron fields of Iron county it
would also touch the new coal fields

1' ened by R. A. Kirker of Parowan, a

j erty is the new coal discovery made
1 by Dr. Green of Cedar City, and it is
reported that new beds of anthracite
I coal have been discovered alonp the
proposed route twentw miles north of
Hurricane.
It is reported in railroad circles that
officials of the Denver & Rio Grande
have under consideration the early ex
tension of a railroad into the Uintah
basin by way of Helper and Indian
canyon. This railroad recently filed
rights of way from Duchesne to Ver
nla in the United States land office.

W. IL LEIGH, Local President.
Bedlandi ! tlifornia, Nov. 7, 1910.
Mr. Harry Leigh) President Arrow
head Trails Association. Cedar City,
Utah. Dear Sir Since the return of
the Arrowh ad Trails paity we have
been very busy on levers! matters for
the betterment of the road and in
many way? for tl a betterment of the
organisation.
With rejrard to road mafters, you
have no doubt li sard of the St. George
road building day and the moving of
the road from Santa Clara Creek to
higher ground. Wo also have positive
assurance that the work on the reser
vation will begin December first. In
Mojave county we have succeeded In
Retting an additional amount of $1800
making a total of $3,000, to be expend
ed on the road in that count v from
Utah to the Nevada line. This ia am
ple to place that stretch in splendid
condition.
We are anxious to know the condi
tion alonir the entire Arrowhead
Trails and for that reason we ask you
to send us such information as you
can get on road matters along that
portion of the Trail between your city
and the cities on each side of you hav
ing chapters.
We also want to know just what
scenic or historical features you have
or contemplate making accessible to
tourists. Road conditions and scenic
attractions are ery important as we
are already receiving numerous in
quiries in regard to both.
On our trip we photographed a
great many features and out of these
we have culled the best for the making
of newspaper cuts, prints and enlarge
ments. Zion Canyon and the Valley
of Fire, (sand-stone dikes in Nevada)
are particularly attractive.
As we are very much in need of
additional func's to carry forward the
contemplated work, w ask that you
kindly inform us at your earliest con
veniences just how many paid up
members you have in your local or
ganization; also semi whatever money
you have collected together with the
signed applications to. H. H. Ford,
treasurer of the Redhulda National
Bank, Redlands. California. We will,
on receipt of same, mail direct to
each applicant a membership card.
We are perfecting a set of by-laws
which will be suitable for your local
organization. We will have a report
covering the entire Arrowhead Trails
district within a short time which we
will forward to tlv various chapters.
If there are any questions you would
like to ask do not hesitate as we will
bo more than glad to help you in any
way possible. Wishing you the great
est of success and trusting that you
will co-operate with us in every way
possible, we are,
Vei v truly yours,
