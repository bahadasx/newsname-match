His Service
BY MRS. F.
Dear Friend at Home: t . :
Guayama, P. R., No- 5, 1916.
In a letter written before leaving
the steamship 1 spoke of meeting on
board several people who live in Forto
Rico. "We learned from them many
interesting and valuable things for us
to know but to many queries the un
Dsual answer seemed to be "It all de
pends on where you are located."
About 8:30 Wednesday November
1st, the island of Porto Rico could be
seen from the steamship "Carolina."
stood on the upper forward deck
from that time on- At a distance of
eight miles the towers of the wireless
station could be distinctly seen. The
-cay was perfect, the atmosphere so
clear that the deep of the ocean look
ing toward the east, seemed as blue
at the horizon line as it did near the
boat
nr i a . . . .
were moj lorxunate, lor as
we approached the Island three of our
steamship friends. Mr Scherr. an
American who had been" at the table
With us, Mr. Barlow, a School Super
visor and Mrs. Domeneck, wife of the
Cemmissioner of the Interior, all came
te lis and pointed out the places of
interest, l here is a splendid Cathloic
church built by funds contributed by
Catholic churches in the States. The
Palace, the House of Poncee de leon
and the historic Morro Castle at the
extreme point on the left as we en
ter he Bay. Leper Island is at the
right, a very pleasant looking place
Whrtre the lepers are well cared for
'Words xanont describe the beauti
ful view across the bay, first there is
the Trihga of palms on a stretch of
lowlands from which rises the sharp
ly outlined foot hills, and in the dls
' tan!e the mountains.
We met the steamship "Brajos"
starting on her return trip to New
York and mail going back to the
States was transfered to her from our
boaf I wished that my friends might
be there too, as I watched the won
dwful sunset.
The old walls of the City of San
Juari are mostly in good preservation
and partly vine covered. The gardens
f palm and flowers are beautiful, the
old buildings quaint and interesting
and the government buildings are fine
structures.
Mr. Miller, Commissioner of Edu
cation came on board and we were in
troduced to him by Mrs- Domeneck.
We had arranged to stay on board the
boat rather than go to a hotel, thru
the advice of Mrs. Domeneck-
After dinner we went with two
ladies from New York, who occupied
a neighboring stateroom, up into the
; City aa far the Plaza around which
are grouped government buildings.
The sidewalks are very narrow,
madd of cement with a stone border;
the streets are paved and also nar
rowjust wide enough for two auto
mobiles to pass. Automobiles seem
as common here as in the States
The shops are very attractive. The
.telephone building is six stories high,
the older buildings are not high, pos
sibly1 on account of the occasional
hurricanes sweeping over the island
, After" breakfast Thursday morning
we were to report to the Commission
er's office. After a short conference
In 'regard to vacancies in several
places, Mr Miller concluded a teacher
was needed in Guayama, a city of 8,
000 on the southern coast of the Is
land lust three miles from the sea.
Mr. Miller arranged for a governnjent
car, a seven passenger Studebaker, to
take us for the sixty mile drive over
the mountains We started at one
o'clock in company with Mr. and Mrs
Miller over this road of wonderful
engineering and long time building,
the King's Highway.. Let me say
here, this ride was the most thrilling
experience of my whole life.
We whirled along past , fine resi
dences with wonderful tropical gar
: dens, modern schools and other build
: lngs on into the foot hills where we

saw banana groves, pineapple and
sugar cane fields and beautiful views
at every turn of mountains and val
ley's and streams. In this place,
"every turn", means much, for a large
part of the way, we continued to go
in a straight line scarcely the length
of the automobile.
And then we began to" climb around
me siae oi tne mountains, the "ser
pentine trail" it is called in some de
scriptions There are toward the top
of the range sharp turns around peaks
and curves where one looks into great
depths across which may be seen the
road on the mountain beyond-
We decended into a valley, after
having passed many tobacco fields
covered with cheese cloth to protect
the plants from the hot sun, and came
to a town with tobacco manufacturing
plants. The odor of the place was
delicious. After this perhaps a quar
ter of a mile of straight road, and
then another climW, mcMre -crooked,
more wildly beautiful and scene than
before We passed coffee trees and
beautiful flowers all along the way.
From the Governor's summer resi
dence on the mountain side one can
see miles and miles away to the south
the Carribean
We met several showers on the
way; and after one, we saw a rain
bow seeming to la.y up against the
side of a mountain The marvelous
beauty of this against the green can
not be described- The mountains are
only about 4000 feet above sea level
and are covered to the very tops with
green grass, foliaga and trees.
At several places we saw the clouds
floating below us above the valleys.
Six miles above Guayama the car
was stopped to give us a chance to
lookupon our future home on a table
land; and beyond the sugar cane fields
and beyond these the sea. To the east
we saw, from this point, one of the
irrigation systems of this section.
This is a dry section of the Island.
Tor a number of weeks there have
been heavy rains, these are nearly
over and then wilr come several
months of dry weather
These rains resemble Ohio rains in
only -one particular they are wet
They come, perhaps when , the sun is
shining, seemingly out of a clear sky,
with a great and sudden down pour.
In a little while it is all over. Just in
the beginning of one of these down
pours as we came down the side of a
mountain and rounded a sharp turn
we had a-blow out. The chauffeur
calmly climbed out in the rain and
put on a new tire.
Presently on coming around a bend
in the road we found ourselves almost
in the City of Guayama
We were hungry people and enjoy
ed an excellent dinner at Hotel
"Paris" .-
At the hotel, in the evening, we met
thesupervisor of this district and the
President of the School Board, both
Porto Ricean gentlemen, educated in
the States; also the American teach
ers, there are six here.
Before I leave the subject of schools
I wish to say something of Mr. Miller.
He is a Wisconsin man, holds a chair
in the State University and at present
is on leave of absence. He is keen and
alert, has a wonderful grasp of the
educational problems of the Island,
is devoted to its best interests and is
evidently beloved by the people with
whom he works He has recently ap
pointed a Porto Ricean gentleman
educated in the States as assistant
Commissioner of Education, not as
he says simply because he is a Porto
Ricean, but because according to the
judgment of Mr. Miller he is the best
man available to fill the position
There are many problems here, and
a man who can do the work so suc
cessfully and so conscientiously as
Mr. Miller is doing, deserves the sup
port and the honor of the folks back
home. -

AFTER ELECTION
The Result in Nation, State and Cpun-
ty A Republican Point of View
Items From The Daily Press That
Indicate the Trend of Affairs.
In face of the uncertainty of the
result of the Presidential Election in
many States it still seems probable
that Woodrow Wilson will succeed
himself as President of the United
States and that Charles E- Hughes
has been defeated as a candidate for
tnat office.
In the State of Ohio, in spite of the
fact that he ran 80,000 votes behind
the head ot his ticket and that his op
ponent, Governor Willis, ran 80,000
votes ahead ot his ticket, James M.
Cox was elected governor and with
him the entire Democratic ticket of
State officers.
The Republican county ticket was
elected in this county with one excep
tion, that of surveyor; C. P. Weber
tne Democratic nominee was elected
by the narrow margin of 47 votes over
C O- Castle the Republican candidate.
Another surprise lor the Republicans
was that in Fulton county the major
ity for the Repulbican candidate for
President .was surprisingly . small
while the vote for Mr Willis for Gov
ernor was very large.
From a Republican point of view.
the main issue in the campaign was
the tariff though the attitude of the
administration in foreign allairs, the
manipulation of the Mexican situa
tion, "pork barrel" methods in the
passage of River and Harbor arid
other Appropriation bills, increase of
expenses of government, direct tax
ation and other items of the Demo
cratic administration furnished ample
ground for Republican criticism. The
ijemocratic answer on the tariff issue
was weak, in fact from a Republican
point of view not an answer but an
evasion; they simply called attention
to the creation of a Tariff Commis
sion Fortunately for the Democratic
party the extraordinary trade condi
tions growing out of the European
war cuvereo. up and transformed the
conditions which followed the applica
tion of the tree trade policy of the
Underwood Law and the unprecedent
ed industrial prosperity growing out
ot War Orders seems to have so
dazzled a majority of the American
citizens that they failed to perceive
that this prosperity is but tempor
ary and that with its cessation the
country must inevitably be plunged
into trade and industrial conditoins
that will bring panic hunger and pri
vation to the masses of the people.
The - Democratic party emphasized
the present prosperous conditions,
which they are in no wise responsible
for, and adopted as their campaign
slogans "He kept us out of war" and
"he gave us an eight hour day," both
of which were discredited and proven
fallacious by - Republican campaign
speakers-
Mr. Hughes, if defeated is not dis-
creditedand the Republican principles
for which he stood are not repudiat
ed Four years more of Democratic
administration. are-Jikely to make
those Republican principles look very
desirable to the American public.
News items in the daily press seem
to indicate that the . reaction has set
in even before absolutely certainty
regarding the election results are
known. Representatives of 50,000 mine
workers in the Mining district of Ohio
have asked both President Wilson and
Governor Willis ; to make official
investigation to determine . the cause
of the high cost of living and take
steps to so reduce prices as to place
the necessities of life within financial
reach of wage earners; they declare
that the earnings of men who are
working steadily are not sufficient to
purchase necessities "of life for even
small families and that actual distress
and hunger prevail in families where
men are steadily employed
This may be taken either as a com
mentary on the present prosperity or
an indication of what is to come- ,
The railroads of- the country, have
begun their fight to test the consti
tutionality of the Adamson Bill in
dead earnest. The Atchison Topeka
and Santa Fe Railway led the way and
thus far the Chicago Rock Island and
Pacific, Chicago Great Western, Mil
waukee and St Paul,, and the Union

JEWELRY and POPULAR Novelties,
many are already purchasing tor gifts, taking
advantage of our low prices, big assortments
and the early buying idea which surely
means big savings.
Pacific have followed suit. On the
other hand according to press reports
government officials have been
informally notified by repre
sentatives of ' the four brotmerhoods
involved that no matter what legal ac
tion is taken, unless the Adamson law
goes into effect January 1st, 1917 the
general strike narrowly averted two
months ago will be called. So much
for the "eight hour law." Mexican
matters are really presenting more of
a problem than ever the reports from
Mexico now indicate that Villa is
gaining control in Mexico U- S. citi
zens are under sentence of death
from Carranza authorities two accus
ed of being cattle thieves and one ac
cused as a Villa spy.
Mr Wilson will have four years of
strenuous work for which the reward
will be the ingratitude1 of many and
the biting criticism of many more.
STORY HOUR.
There wMl be two public library
story hours Saturday afternoon
At 2:15 o'clock Mrs- W. C. Schafer
will tell to children from' kindergar
ten to third grade age, 'inclusive the
fables and myths she was to have
told last week. .
At .three o'clock Miss Marie Dren
nan will tell of Moses and the He
brews to pupils from fourth to eighth
grades, inclusive It is the plan at
every meeting of this older section to
have, the story of some great, nation
told as exemplified by its leading man
or woman and several men and wom
en all good story tellers are to present
these characters.
That story hours are popular is
shown by an attendance of sixty
eight children last Saturday at the
single session for little children.
Men Feel Tired, Too.
While much is said about tired
women it must be remembered that
men also pay the penalty of over
work. When the kidneys are weak,
inactive or sluggish, when one feels
tired out and miserable, has the
"blues", lacks energy and ambition,
Foley Kidney Pills are tonic and
strengthening. They act quickly.

land, September 24, 18C2. She came
to tnis country about 1890, and about
two years later became a member ot
the Buxton family. From that time
she was the ever ready helper in the
home and neighborhood. J. hen, on
February 12, lt05, occurred the death
of "mama" Buxton, as she always
called Mrs. Buxton, with whom sne
had been the closest companion during
those many years.
Because of her long relation with
the family, it was no surprise that she
was united in marriage with Mr
Leander Buxton, which occurred Jan
uary 7, 1907.'
Early in life she became a Chris

fession could never be questioned. At
the time- of her coming into the Bux
ton family she was the superintendent
of the German Reform Sunday School
sometime after entering her new
home she united with the Ambrose
Baptist church. Its interests were
ever after her interests and no service
was too great for her to give.
' On their removal to Wauseonthey
united with the Baptist church, she
being a tried and faithful member till
her death.
For a long time she has 'been more
of a physieal' sufferer than any one
can tell- After a brief acute illness
finally, Saturday morning, November
11, as the sun was rising, she passed
to that brighi eternal day where the
sun never sets and the lamb is the
light thereof, and there shall be no
more night.
Not only do all the immediate fami
ly mourn her departure, but a very
large circle of nieghbors and acquain
tances grieve because they have all
lost a dear friend
