BRYAN WILL FIGHT
FOR A DRY NATION
WANTS DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO
DECLARE FOR PROHIBITION
IN 1020.
William Jennings Bryan will devote
the next four years of his life to mak
ing Democracy dry.
In an interview published in a New-
York newspaper Wednesday the one
time secretary of state declared his
party cannot afford to take the "im
moral side of a moral issue," that
prohibition is a big issue now and
that members of the Democracy will
not allow the party to be "buried in
a drunkard's grave."
Bryan's drive against the demon
rum will start immediately, for he
speaks Sunday at Indianapolis and
Monday at Chicago. Conservatism,
He says, will support the Wilson econ
omic and legislative program by 1920,
hence the party will be free to look
to new, important issues, such as pro
hibition and woman suffrage.
Says Election Psvra Way.
"The election returns," Bryan said.
' make it easy for the. Democratic
party to take the lead in both these
reforms. It does not owe anything
to the political bosses who control the
v et cities, and besides, a considerable
majority of President Wilson's elec
toral votes came from dry territory.
"If the Democratic party takes the
liquor side of the prohibition ques
tion. it will risk a loss without cer
ti.inty of gain even if it could be sup
posed that it was willing to make an
even trade of dry votes for wet ones."'
Mr. Bryan suggested that the Re
publican party, too, may be in the dry |
fight in the hope of winning the dry j
vote of Western states that went i
azcinst it this year.
Announcement Expected
Bryan's announcement that he was
going to force the Democratic party
to declare for national prohibition
was not unexpected at the national
capital, says a dispatch from that
city, but his campaign along that line
will meet with serious opposition
within ,hls party which will be liable
to spilt the Democrats even worse
than did the silver-gold issue of years
apo.
White House officials declined to
discuss tho announcement. It was
pointed out, however, that President
Wilson's stand on the subject has al
ready been fully outlined. On na
tional prohibition as on equal suf
frage, the President takes the posi
tion that it is a question that should
be decided by the states.
Democratic leaders at the national
capital admitted that the former sec
retary of state would obtain a large
following among Democrats for a flat
declaration national prohibition.
Especially will this be true in the
rtates already having prohibition laws
i nd In some other states of the West.
Mr. Bryan's firm belief that nation
al prohibition Is becoming a para
mount political issue has been known
to his Intimate friends for months.
He made a positive stand on the
question at the St. Louis Democratic
convention last summer, but consent
ed to the question being sidetracked
because he wished party harmony to
continue. He told his friends then,
however, that he would leave nothing
undone to force the Democratic party
1o decide for or against prohibition
by 1920.
The state tax commission has col
lected an inheritance tax of $726.36
on the estate of the late Mary Ann
Hartley.

OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1916.
CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT.
President to Ask Congress to Stop
HUK<* Campaign K\|>emlitures.
WASHINGTON, 1). Nov. 17.
A corrupt practices act, with teeth,
will be one of the first pieces of leg
islation which President Wilson will
ask of congress. Just what form it
" ill take is not yet decided on. but it
is certain that it will limit expendi
tures of money by national commit
tees in presidential and congression
al elections.
It will also be so drawn that a stop
will be put to enormous expenditures
by individuals on their own respon
sibility. According to information
r< aching here, much of the latter was
done in the recent campaigns and
both parties had the benefit.
Mrs. Engleliart Asks Divorce.

house in Old Tacoma. was Saturday
sued for divorce and alimony of $250
a month asked by his wife, Loa A.

Another Suit Against McCorkle.

SENATE TO PROBE
BIG BOODLE FUND
DEMOCRATS CHARGE REPI'K
LICANS SPENT $7,000,000 IN
HUGHES' CAMPAIGN.
Plans were completed this week by
administration leaders for a senate
investigation into charges that the
Republican national committee spent
hundreds of thousands of dollars ille
gally in the national campaign.
The matter has been discussed by
President Wilson and senate leader-i,
resulting in a decision to begin the
investigation shortly after congress
convenes in December, it was learned
from official quarters.
A general assemblage of Democrat
it senators in Washington the fore
part of this week caused reports
which were denied by all officials, that
a special session of congress would be
called.
From administration officials cloße
to President Wilson It was learned
that Democratic National Chairman
McCormick has received what he
claims to be positive evidence that the
Republican national committee col
lected more than $3,000,000 in W&U
street just prior to the election and
spent a large part of this in Indiana
and West Virginia. The total ex
penditures of the Republicans were
said to be more than $7,000,000.
It was learned that the department
of justice has been conducting a se
cret investigation into the amount of
money spent during the campaigns
as well as of illegal voting. Although
this Investigation touched the Demo
crats as well as the Republican ex
penditures It was ordered by Attorney
General Gregory after a conference
with Vance McCormick in New York
when they discussed reports that the
Republicans had accumulated a large
secret fund.
RAILROADS LOOKED TO HUGHES.
Expected Him to Change Adamson
Law, Brotherhood Leaders Declare
That the railroads hoped for some
way out of making the Adamson law
Ineffective in event of Hughes' elec
tion is the belief of high railroad
brotherhood men.
Some of them declared secretly that
Monday's conference with the railroad
managers over operation of-the law
was called solely because President
Wilson was re-elected. On the other
hand, they charged that the railroads
hoped for a change in the law if
Hughes were successful.
The conference failed of any agree
ment on operation of the law and a
deadlock exists between the men and
the railroads, which are lighting the
constitutionality of the measure.
Scores of crooks, swindlers and
confidence men, some of them inter
nationally notorious, have come to
the United States as the only rich
country open to them since the out
break of the European war, accord
ing to the United States secret ser
vice and the bureau of investigation
of the department of justice.

LOCAL OEMOGHATS
CELEBRATE VICTORY
| STAGE PARADE AND JOLLIFICA-
I
• TION—GOVERNOR "PANS"
PERKINS PRESS.
With a band, red lire, torches and
; banners galore, several hundred ad
mirers of President Wilson and Gov
ernor Lister jubilated last Monday
night by parading the streets and then
winding up at the Central hall, where
500 people parked the hail to capac
ity and cheered Maurice Langhorne
and Governor Lister to the echo.
The parade, headed by the band,
covered the downtown streets and the
marchers were cheered by large
crowds on evvjry corner. Many of the
banners carried by the marchers
brought forth much applause and
many exchanges of repartee. "Oh,
you Wilson," "The Women Did It,"
"Sammy Perkins Helped," "We Kept
'Em Out of Washington," "Ain't It
Awful?" "Oh, You Lister," and
"Teddy Won't Be Secretary of War,"
were some of the legends carried on
the banners.
Blind Partisanship Is Past.
The meeting at Central Hall was
presided over by P. M. Troy, and the
irusic for the evening was furnished
by Mr. Carl Nommensen and Mrs.
Maurice Langhorne. Attorney Lang
home, of Tacoma, paid eloquent trib
ute to President Wilson and Governor
Lister, pointing out the fact that the
day of blind partisanship Is past and
men are elected on their merits. Mr.
Langhorne also complimented the wo
men of the West on their knowledge
of politics and their intelligent use
of the ballot.
Governor Lister assured his audi
ence of his appreciation of its expres
sion of good will and promised his
best efforts toward the upbuilding of
the state and the welfare of its people.
He assailed in no uncertain terms the
Perkins Press of Olympia and Tacoma
for its political activity in attempting
to control men in office for its own
selfish ends.
"I want to tell you people of Olym
pia," he said, "that the biggest lia
bility that you have is the foreign
owned newspapers that subordinate
the welfare of the city to their own
interests in an endeavor to control the
patronage of the state.
Lister, Not Perkins, Governor.
"I want to tell you here and now,"
be added, "that I, and not Sammy
Ferkins, will be Governor of the state
for the next four years."
The Governor's references to the
Perkins Press brought forth great ap
plause from the audience.
The Democrats and independent
Wilson and Lister supporters were in
the highest spirltß and the jollifica
tion was one of the most enthusiastic
gatherings the city has recently seen.
The Democratic ladies served cider
and doughnuts and a general hand
shaking closed the meeting.
On motion of Prosectuing Attorney
Ysntis, after consultations with va
rious witnesses. Justice of the Peace
Walter Crosby Saturday dismissed
the charge against J. Emmett Brown,
teacher at the South Bay school, of
having illegally punished Gordon
Madden, the 7-year-old son of S. T,
Madden of South Bay. It developed
that the bruises suffered by the lad
were sustained in a game of "lap
jack" with another youngster.
