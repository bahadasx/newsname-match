"After a long period of comparative

activity, the British have launched
a major attack In an entirely new
section of the Somme line," says the
military expert of the New York
Times.
"This section Is in part the line
that received the first shock of the
British offense in July. At that time
the British advanced beyond the vil
lage of Serre, but the Germans, pivot

British have again struck, and this

time have made serious Inroads In
the German lines.
"When the British are able to gain
good gun positions north of the An
cre (and It may be that this last at
tack has brought them this advan
tage) the German line which stretch
es north from Beaumont-Hamel will
be doubled up on short sections at a
time. The situation about Combles
will then be duplicated. A continua
tion of this process and the line will
then be straightened out from Arras
south.
"The situation now is that with
every advance north of the river not
one, but two sections of the German
line will be affected. If the Germans
south of the Ancre can be dislodged
by a flanking operation In the north,
then will come a situation very much
to the British liking. The salient of
which Beaucourt has been the apex
is almost a right angle. The sides of
this angle are too far apart for the
guns on one side to reach to the oth
er. Unless this can be done there is
nothing necessarily weak In this form
of battle line. At present there is
nothing weak in the German position
and will not be until the salient
can be sharpened Into an acute
angle. As this angle Is produced,
the length of the German lines
which can be reached by the British
artillery Increases, so that with each
blow a greater front is affected.
This is the principal danger to the
Germans in this last attack."
