ORGANIZED A MISSION CIRCLE
- Tuesday evening Mrs.. H. Robbie
and Mrs. S. E. Arnold invited a Bum
tier of young ladles of the Christian
church to the Hobble home tor the
-purpose of organising a Mission Cir
cle. The new society begins with a
membership of thirteen.- The officers
elected were: Maurlone Farrell,
president; Louise Wilson, vice presi
dent; Margaret Reasoner, secretary;
Elane Black, treasurer; Helen Mat
Trin, pianist, and Mrs. Arnold, circle
-director. The next meeting of the
circle will e held at the borne of
their president on the first Wednes
day in December. After the business
was completed, Mrs. Hobble, assist
ed by Mrs. J. S. Jones and Mrs. C. F.
Hoffman, served a delicious lunch.
"The young ladles decided to call their
society the Mary Beecher Hall Circle,
In honor of Miss Mary Beecher, who,
"before her marriage to Mr. Hall, was
-a teacher In the Liberal schools, an
-active worker In the Christian church
and is now a missionary In China.
"The same price the nation over.
The old saying: "You can tell t man by the clothes he wears", takes on a new mean
ing now that Styleplus Clothes are made. True, style in clothes as well as in men, is the
result of true quality. The man who wears Styleplus Suits and Overcoats not oDly com
pels respect for his appearance, but he also shows the 6ne American trait of common sense
economy. He pays just $17.00 for his clothes because he knows that Styleplus have made
it unnecessary to pay either one cent more or one cent less to get the smart style, the lively
fabrics, and the splendid guaranteed wear that he requires. -
This is the day of high prices. But thn price of Styleplny remains the same. Their
value is more remarkable now than ever. Their .volume output and scientific methods
enable them to give such unique guaranteed values clothes which have astounded and de
lighted a whole nation of men.

PUT UP THOSE MAIL BOXES
The tre mail ddtWy.eiee; tor
Liberal, which Is due to go into effect
December 1, will be indefinitely post
poned by the department unless every
residence and business house in town
Is provided with a mail box located In
a conspicuous place, before that time.
No residence or business house will
be served by the carrier that hasn't
complied with this requirement, and
failure on the part of the patrons to
attend to it before the time for the
service to start will mean either a
postponement or complete withdraw
al of the service. Business houses
that to desire may arrange to have
their mall delivered through a slot In
the front doors of their places ot
business, but they must have some
place to receive it. This means
a good deal to the people 01
Liberal and they can't afford
to let this opportunity of free deliv
ery go by on account of a little laxity
in complying with the departmental
requirements. Get busy and put up
your mail boxes.

fc OPPORTUNITY
By Walter Malone
They do. me wrong who say I come no more
When once I knock and fall to And you In;
For every day I stand outside your door,
And bid yoa wake and rise to fight and win.
Wall not for precious chances passed away,
Weep not tor golden ages on the wane;
Each night I burn the records ot the day,
At sunrise every soul is born again.
Laugh like a boy at splendors that have sped, 1
To vanished Joys be blind and deaf and dumb;
My Judgments seal the dead past with its dead,
But never bind a moment yet to come.
Though deep in mire, wring not your hands and weep,
I lend my arm to all who say: "I can."
No shamefaced outcast ever sank so deep
But he might rise again and be a man.

TWO SMALL FIRES
The fire department was called out
Saturday morning to put out a small
blaze that had started in a refrig
erator car in the railroad yards. The
railroad fire department beat them
to it, however, and the fire was out
by the time the city department got
there. Monday night about 9 o'clock
the roof on the home of Mrs. C. A. B.
Cross caught lire from a defective
flue and the fire wagon was called
to put out the blaze. It was extin
guished without much trouble or
damage.
RECEIPT FOR CONCRETE WALK
OR DRIVE
A satisfactory concrete walk or
drive may be laid on the ground
without filling or excavating if the
ground lies so there will be good
drainage, so water will not collect
under the walk or drive. , The drain
age requisite, however, almost al
ways demands a base of three or four
Inches of cinders, well tamped, says
Professor C. C. Williams of the en
gineering department of the Univer
sity of Kansas. On this base of cin
ders there should be placed three
inches, or better, four Inches of con
crete consisting of one part best Kan
sas Portland cement, two parts clean
sand and four parts rock, well mixed
and then wet until It "quakes like
silver" but Is not sloppy. Immedi
ately after this course Is put down
put on the finishing coat of one part
cement and two parts sand. Do not
delay to put on the finishing at once.
says Mr. Williams. Do not trowel (
the finishing coat That makes a
smooth surface that Is dangerous to
alk:on in. sloppy weather. . Brush
the finishing coat with a wire brush
or by floating, that Is, drawing a
board over It so the surface will be
slightly rough and give a safe foot
hold, t
HELD A BIO RATIFICATION
The Democrats ot Liberal, feeling
highly exuberant over the results
ot tbe election last week, rigged up
an old fashioned "ratification" Fri
day night. H. O. Vessels, the black
smith, brought out his anvils and
several pounds of powder and for an
hour or two tbe Inundations sound
ed like Villa was camping Just out
side the city limits. The Liberal
band came marching down the street
playing a patriotic air, and leading
the band were Judge Hubbard and
Joe Rudolph carrying a large flag on
one side ot which was the picture of
President Wilson and on the other
Congressman Shouse. About halt
the population had fallen in behind
the band and formed a parade line
before the musicians came to a halt
in front of the Summers store. Hera
several more selections were played
by the band after which speeches
were made by A. A. Farmer, representative-elect;
Judge Hubbard, Sec
retary Broadwell of the Chamber of
Commerce, and Auctioneer Dicker
son. After the performance had last
ed about an hour the band rendered
"the funeral march ot the O. O. P.,"
and the crowd went home. Chief of
Police Eden turned the town over
to the boys for the evening and mere
ly stuck around on the edge of the
crowd to see that everyone behaved,
which everyone did. It was a Joy
ous occasion and everyone felt re
paid for coming to town that night
and watching the fun.
