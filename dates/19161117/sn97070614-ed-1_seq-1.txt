The contest over the estate of the late

the probate court last Thursday, when

agreed that the widow, Emma Smith,
should have the home in Owosso and a
land contract worth $0,500. ; The step-;
son later made objection, claiming the

intended she should have, but the at

; Badly Injured By Auto,
Burns Breaugh 19, right shprtstop
on 1 the American Malleables indoor
base ball team, is in Miller hospital
bady -hurt and John Smith, an Ann
Arbor fireman, is locked up in the
county jail as a result of a Ford car,
driven by Smith, striking Breaugh,
knocking him to the pavement and
dragging him some distance Wednes
day. The accident occurred on Main
street just cast of the bridge.
Breaugh, on the way home from his
work, was crossing the Rtreet at an
angle, just cast of the bridge, when
Smith's car driven by himself, ap
proached from the west. Witnesses
estimate that the car was gaing be
tween 25 and 30 miles an hour. They
declare that the car, instead of re
maining on the right side of the street
cut across to the left. Breaugh was
on the street car track when he was
struck, but the car dragged him sev
eral feet and ho was lying only a
sliort distance from the north curb
when picked up.
Owosso New Lothrop Flint.
There is now more than an even
chance that the Lansing Owosso electric
line will be extended from this Jetty to
New Lothrop and Flint In the early
future. The Michigan Railway Co. has
for more than a year past been consid
ering the question of an extension
either to Saginaw or Flint, several sur
veys having been made over different
routes to Saginaw to determine the ap
proximate cost but all were found to be
very expensive and impractical. The
probabilitp now is that the line will go
to New Lothrop and Flint providing
the right of way can be secured at a
reasonable cost. The negotiatiops have
gone so far that the road is almost an
assured fact if the people in the town
ships in which it will run can practi
cally provide the right of way. .
The Owosso Improvement Association
has appointed as a committee to have
charge of this matter, E. O. Dewey, W.
F. Gallagher and J. Y. Martin, the
first of whom will at once take up the
right of way proposition with the prop
erty owners.
Owosso citizens have for years wished
for rail connection with New Lothrop.
and have frequently signified their will
ingness to do. anything within their
power to secure the same, and without
doubt an opportunity will be - afforded
for them to show their interest In a
real way. The citizens of Hazelton!
township and New Lothrop are also
greatly interested and will pull hard for:
connection with the rest of the world'
by rail. Without question the citizens!
of Caledonia and Venice townships will
be found widi awake to this chance to
secure an electric line which will give
them an opportunity to easily reach
Corunna jwoseo.

GOLDEN WEDDING
Mr. and Mrs. John Brooks Celebrated
Their Golden Wedding at a Party
at Their Home on Adams Street in
the City Wednesday.
The comfortable home built by Mr.
and Mrs. Brooks more than 30 years
ago, during the first summer of their
residence in Owosso, had been made
more than usually inviting with flow
ers, and the deft feminine touch had
created an effect imparting a sugges
tion of an event of more than usual
significance. At noon the gay party
was seated around tables there that
were laden with an abundance of sea
sonable good things to eat.' Discus
sion of the repast was followed by the
taking of group pictures that will bo
cherished mementoes of the occasion.
In 1912 Mr. Brooks celebrated the
fiftieth anniversary of a church at
Exeter, Ont., for which he had hewed
the timber in his sturdier days. In
March of this- year he observed the
anniversary of his initiation a half
century ago into the mysteries of Odd
Fellowship at Chagrin Falls, Ohio.
Since he became affiliated with that
order he has lnissed only lodge meet
ings that illness prevented him from
attending. Twice he has been honor
ed by election to the office of Noble
Grand. Mr. Brooks has gone through
all of the chairs of the lodge and is
thoroughly conversant with the ritual.
He is a staunch champion of fratern
alism. A native of Devonshire, England,
Mr. Brooks left there with his parents
five years after his birth, April 10,
1844, and went to Canada, residing
for a time at Osseo, Ont. In 1864 the
famijy moved to Chagrin Falls, Ohio,
and it was there that John met Miss
Elizabeth A. Davis. They were mar
ried on November 12, 18GG. Mrs.
Brooks' two brothers, both attendants
at tho wedding, are still living.
Mrs. Brooks was born in Plymouth,
England, and came to America at the
age of five years with ' her parents,
Mr. and Mrs. James Davis. The fam
ily resided in Cleveland, Ohio, but a
few weeks before removing to Chag
rin Falls.
Mr. and Mrs. Brooks came to Owos
so in 1886 and built the home where
they now reside. They have been
ljiembers of the First M. E. church
for several decades and have rarely
missed services there. They also are
afliliated respectively with the Owos
so lodge No. 88, I. 6. O. F., and Star
of Hope Rebekahs. Mr. Brooks is
still vigorous and is in the employ of
John Detwiler successor of C. C.
Duff. He was associated with Mr.
Duff for nearly 30 years.
Mrs. Brooks also enjoys compara
tively good health.
Mr. and Mrs. Brooks have the
hearty congratulations of a host of
friends in Owosso who hope that they
will retain their faculties to enjoy
many more happy anniversaries.
The bride and groom of 50 years
ago have five children, all of whom
were with them Wednesday. They
are: Wilson Brooks and Mrs. S.
L. Henderson, of Owosso; Mrs.
Fred Hurry, of Lansing; F. I).
