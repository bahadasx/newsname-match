Pinned between the raidiator of a

of the . best known physicians of this

Edward W. Dupee and F. jl". Day, in
attendance declare- that his, condition
today, 'after ' his passing- a qIet night,
are favorable for his recovery.
Dr. Hair; who isl
an ardent sports
enthusiast, . arose
eany yesteraay
morning with the intention of going
hunting. Darkness had hardly been
dissipated when he - unlocked tthe
garage adjoining his house and after"
securing the (Iog In the tonneau of
the car started to crank the machine
that, has hot. been, in use for some
time! - Under the mistaken belief that
the levers were "neutral" he turned
the engine over by means of a crank
handle in the frontl' ' With sudden
impetus Dr. , Hair was dragged across
the floor and pinioned tightly against
the brick wall. The front :of the ma
chine tightly pressed against his stom
ach and lips, while in some manner
both hands were pinioned.
.Though he cried lustily for aid, the
noise of his voice was drowned in the
whir of the rapidly revolving motor
and the escaping smoke and gas
which ' threatened to overcome , him.
The dog realizing something serious
had happened began to give that, long
"piercing yowl. which characterizes an
aninial in pain. '
Though neighbors raised their win
dows and ' declaimed against the un
seemly noise . emenatlng from the in
side of the garage none ' seemed to
realize . that an accident, had happen
ed and they again retired to their
beds ' grumbling at 'the ' apparent
thoughtlessness of the motorist they
could not see. . , . , v
'An unidentified man, who- later ad-
itted that he heard cries he 'thought
human feared to open the door lest
the dog attack him. ' j . ; " '
About 7 oclock,'- John . Porter, a
groceryman at 740 State street, was
on the way towards his place of, busi
ness. He was attracted by 'the dog's
barking and finally made Investiga
tion. He found Dr. Hair in a semi
conscious state -but still able to direct
the manner of shutting off the power
and backing the machine. - .
As soon as this" had been accom
plished Dr. Hair ' collapsed. ' He was
carried into his house and medical
assistance was summoned.
Physicians declare that had not. aid
arrived at the opportune time it did,
the spark of 4ife would have been ex
tinguished as a result of the constant
pressure' and the extreme pain suffer
ed by the victim. '
The regret displayed today over the
unfortunate accident is 'not alone
shared by Bridgeport residents where
for years Dr! Hair has been known aa
a pharmacist, emergency surgeon and
highly sueessful medical practitioner,,
but will evoke sympathy, throughout
the United States and, Canada' where

"
VOTE INQUIRY
4 f
It is likely the investigation. Into
Fairfield county election returns will
extend to the registration. Informa
tion is abroad which seems to show
that among the large, number of new
comers registered were some who were
not entitled to become voters in
Bridgport.- '
Another feature which , is said to be
receiving the attention of the investi
gators is the employment of workers.
The polling places, it is - said,' were
populated with these workers, men
with nothing to do,, except vote and
induce others to vote. One - result
from this part of the inquiry, unless
those conducting it are mistaken, will
be a clarification of : the corrupt prac
tices act. ' :
The act seems to forbid the employ
ment of persons except those neces
sarily employed about the polls. The
hiring of a' Jarge number of men
merely to talk and persuade, under
the above interpretation of the statute,
is merely a method of buying votes.
Is this a legal method, or illegal?
This will be threshed oit, perhaps by
criminal proceedings brought directly
to the claim of violation of the
statute. The statute also forbids em
ploying any person for a valuable con
sideration, to induce or procure other
persons to vote. Whether the method
used In hiring workers is a violation
of this statute is another problem that
will be solved.

'EDDY' CAUSED;
U-BOAT CRASH,
SAYS CUPTAIN
Skipper of Second Convoy
Gives Details of Marine
Tragedy."
.New London, , Nov. 17 According
to a statement made here this after
noon by. Captain Baker, commanding
the tug Cassie, the other conveyer of
the peutschland, an "eddy" caused
the submarine to .crash into the tug
Scott in The Race this morning. Capt.
Baker was the first to giv a detailed
story of the tragedy in which five of
the crew of the Scott , lost their
lives. . -
The Cassie was traveling about half
a mile astern of the Deutschland and
the Sc'ott and submarine Were moving
about abreast. The sea was calm,
Captain Baker said, and conditions
were, normal.- The Scott carried the
usual lights but the Deutschland had
only her headlight and two side
lights. . .
The tide was running almost full
and when about seven miles west of
Race Rock they ' struck an "eddy"
which twisted them . about and out of
control. Shortly afterwards they came
togetner. xie neara me crasu ui mo ,
impact. He . said! he had not 1 observed
the closeness of the lights before hear
ing 'the. crash. The . night was-clear,
he said, and there were nq boats other
than the two tugs and the submarine
Deutschland in the vicinity. He gave
no credence to a report that- a hostile
motorbpat was approaching the submarine-
at the time of the accident, -r
Captain Baker said that when the
collision occurred he at once headed
for the spot. . On arriving there he
saw Captain Hinsch in the water and
took him -on' board the Cassie. Earlier
reports had it that. Hinsch had been
rescued by the Deutschland.
None : of the members of the tug's
crew were in sight and he considered
it probable that the tug-went down
with the men at their various sta
tions, th'e aptafn in the pilothouse
and the engineer in his engine room,
giving them practically no chance for
their lives. .
The i Deutschland, tied up in her
protecting "crib" at the state pier,
is undergoing repairs today. Henry
G. Hilken, of Baltimore, president of
the Eastern Forwarding Co., said to
day that so far as he knew the only
damage the submarine suffered was a
twisted stem. It was learned later,
however, that the undersea boat has
In her bow at least one. hole about 20
Inches square. A portable forge was
taken down to the pier and the hole
Is being patched up. It was learned
that the Deutschland carries duplicate
parts of her machinery but it was said
none of these would have to be used
as t he interior escaped injury. J

New London, Conn., Nov. 17 Five lives were lost when the
German submarine Deutschland, which left port early today for
Bremen, rammed and sent to the bottom with its crew, the T. A.
Scott, Jr., one of its two convoying tugs. After the accident, the
Deutschland returned to port. The dead: y "
Captain John Gurney; William A. Caton', engineer; Edward
Stone, fireman; Clarence B. Davison, cook; Eugene Duzant, deck

.
The collision occurred abo ut a mile inside The Race, and,
according' to a member of the Deutschland's crew, came "all in a
minute." ' , .'
The tug, he said, got unexpectedly in front of the Deutsch
land, the distance being so. sligh t between them that the sub
mersible had no chance of avoiding the collision. The Deutsch
land struck the tug near the stern, lifting it well out of the water
and sending the Scott's bow under. 1 . . .
Almost immediately afterwards, the boilers on the tug ex-'
ploded and-the vessel sank. V .
CAPTAIN HINSCH IS RESCtJED
Captain Fred Hinsch, of the interned German steamer Nec
kar, who was on the tug, grasped a guy rope and was drawn,
down with it. When he rose & the surface he managed to. seize'
a life preserver which had been thrown out by the DeutschlLncl
and was taken on board that vessel, by which he was brought
back to New London. The Deutschland was not seriously hurt,
it was stated, anad would probably be ready to sail in a few
days after repairs had been made.
' Several of the bow plaes were bent and the rivets loosened,
but tne interior of the submarine was not damaged.
Captaift Koenig, of the Deutschland,
appeared pale and shaken as he
stepped ashore from his vessel A on its
returri. He refused to talk about the
collision and immediately sent word to
Vice President Paul G. Hilken, of the
Eastern Forwarding company, who ar
rived' at the company's offices shortly
afterwards and went into consultation
with him. -
V "Captain Hinsch is recuperating
from the shock of the accident at his
home and I beg that neither you nor
any other, newspapermen wiU attempt
to disturb him," said Vice 'President
Paul Li. G. Hilken to a reporter at the
offices of the Eastern Forwarding Co
early this morning. "He is sleeping
Just now' and so far as we are able
tol earn from the physician in attend
ance he is not likely to suffer per
manently from the trying experience
through which he passed.
"Insofar as the accident itself is
concerned," continued Mr. Hilken, "I
know as yet little more about it than
you. When tne company is in pos
, nf ii atatAT,t

w be issued Lto Jhe newspapers t All
will be treated alike in the matter.
One announcement will , answer for
all. This statement will not be given
out before 'late this evening, if at all
today.
"The drowning of the crew of the
tug T. :A. Scott, Jr., Is a most regretta
ble occurrence and none feels it more
keenly than the officials Jbf the for
warding company and the officers and
men of the Deutschland. That is was
unavoidable goes without saying. Cap
tain Koehig is as well as could be ex
pected under the circumstances but
he will grant no interviews to any
one.
Although Mf. Hilken declined to
. discuss the details of the tragedy, it
was- said, -this morning, that the
Deutschland ' struck the tug on the
starboard side amidships and that the
towboat sank in three minutes. The
Deutschland was carrying but. few
lights and a heavy ground swell was
rolling. Captain Hinsch is under
stood to have been standing op. the
deck of, the tug with a megaphone
when the collision occurred. He
leaped into the sea and was flounder
ing in the current when a life pre
server thrown from the Deutschland
reached him.
The Deutschland drew out of her
pocket - at the pier of the Eastern
Forwarding Co. at 1:30 o'clock this
morning accompanied by v the. tugs T.
A. Scott and the Alert, of the T. A.
Scott Wrecking Co., sub-agents of the
Eastern Forwarding Co. She car
ried on her homeward dash a cargo
valued at $2,000,000 and consisting
of nickel, rubber and silver bars.
The trip down the f harbor was
without incident and when last seen
by a newspaper launch the submersi
ble was ploughing through a smooth
sea at the rate of 12 knots an hour,
headed for Montauk Point. . The
newspaper launch returned here af
ter following the submarine several
miles. At that time the sea was
smooth and the moon in its last quar
ter cast its rays over the water. The
members of the Deutschland's crew
In their oilskins were on deck. Greet
ings shouted at them by passing craft
were not returned.
Failure of the tugs to return at an
early hour led ' to much speculation
but it was believed that they would
accompany the submersible weH be
yond the three mile limit,
ly had been ready for her dash for
some days' her departure was rather
unexpected Her skipper, Paul Koe-.
nlg, .spent the evening in his usual
leisurely manner about the city. He
called at two hotels and shook hands
with friends. When asked about his
sailing, the captain mere smiled and
said he did not know.
After leaving a theatre, the captain
strolled down to the state pier, stop-
? ping to converse with persons on the
way. The machinery of the boat had
been " tested days before and the craft
was provisioned. , " '
. First of all, the lights at the pier
v. ere extinguished! and the launch
Ef co, of the North German Lloyd liner
Willehad, scurried down the river to
see that the course was clear. Then
the steel net that had protected the
entrance to the pocket was hauled up.

SAY DAMAGE IS SLIGHT.
Baltimore, Nov. 17 The damage to
the Deutschland apparently was ,
slight, according' to officials of the,
North German Lloyd line here, who
got into long distance telephonic com
munication with the offices of the
Eastern Forwarding Co. at New Lon
don, when they learned of the col
lision between the submarine and. her "
tug this morning. A thorough exami--hatiqn,
however, would be made at ;
once, they said. . to determine the exact
damage. -
NO HOSTILE CRAFT NEAR
Washington, Nov. . 1 7 -Official , re
ports from Collector McGovern' at
New London, Conn:, add nothing to
the unofficial reports of the Deutsch
land's mishap and contain nothing
whatever to substantiate a published
report that a hostile motor launch at
tempted to ram the submersible. Sec
retary Daniels has called' for a navy
report from Rear Admiral Grant, in
charge of the American submarine
flotm.
The German embassy regarded the
accident as being especially deplora
ble because the Deutschland is Urgent
ly needed in Germany and the mall
on board is an accumulation of threo
months. Some of . the mall matter
the embassy desires to reach Berlin
at tne earliest possible moment.
"Count Von Bernstorff. the German
ambassador, made -inquiries regarding
the identity of:the victims of the
disaster. He . expressed ,the hope
that the Deutschland was not damag
ed to such an , extent as to cause her
sailing to be much postponed.
