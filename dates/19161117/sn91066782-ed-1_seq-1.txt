New London, Conn., Nov. 17 The Ger
man submarine Deutschland, which left
New London early to-day, collided with
one of her own tugs off the Race and
the tug was sunk, five men being
drowned. The Deutschland returned to
New London. The only passenger on
the tug, the T. A. Scott, jr., was Cap
tain Fred Ilinsch of the German liner
Xeckar. Captain John Gurney and all of
the crew went down with the tug, which
sank almost immediately.
The Deutschland left port for the re
turn trip to Brevrajen at about 1:30
o'clock, two tugs and a newspaper
launch accompanying her. The trip down
the harbor was without incident and
when last seen bv the newspaper men
the submersible was ploughing through !
a smooth sea at the rate ot about twelve
knots an hour, being headed for Mon
tank point. Not until the Deutschland
returned to port shortly after 5 o'clock
was anything known of 'the accident
which happened about twelve miles from
port.
Captain Koenig of the Deutschland ap
peared pale and shaken as he stepped
ashore and he refused to talk ot the ao
cklent. "It all happened in a minute,'
aecordins: to a member of the Deutsch,-
land crew who talked briefly of the af
fair. The tug,, he said, got in front of
the submersible and the Deutschland
struck it in the stern, lifting it far
out of the water and the tug's nose went
under. A boiler explosion followed im
mediately.
Captain Ilinsch of the steamer Nackar
caught a guy rope and was carried down
with the tug. When he re-appeared on
the surface lie managed to seize a life
preserver from the Deutschland and was
hauled aboard the submarine.
The Deutschland was not seriously
damaged, it was stated, and probably
would be able to sail in a few days when
repairs have been made. Several bow
plates were bent and rivets loosened, but
the interior was not damaged. Repairs
will be made by the crew.
The dead are: John Gurney, captains
William A. Caton, engineer; Edward
Stone, fireman; Clarence B. Davison,
took; Eugene Duzant, deck hand.
The cargo carried bv the Deutschland
was estimated to be worth over $2,000,
000. It consists largely of crude rub
ber. nickel, zinc and silver bars. She also
has several sacks of mail from the Ger
man embassy at Washington. Some of
the mail was said to be for the German
emperor.
The Deutschland arrived in New Lon
don on November 1 for her second trip
to this country. Her first record making
voyage was to Baltimore last summer.
On her trip here the craft brought a
rargo estimated at ten million dollars
The freight was composed of dyestuffs,
chemicals and medicines, besides securi
ties and bonds.
The Rumanians have suffered
further reverses at the hands of
General Von Falkenhayn's invad
ing forces, according to to-day's
official announcement by the Ger
man war office. Taking more than
2,000 prisoners and a dozen ma
chine guns, the Teutonic forces in
yesterday's operations carried the
mountain peak on the Moldavian
frontier of Rumania, penetrated
the Rumanian position in the Fre
deal region and scored advances
, south of Rothenthurm pass, the
statement asserts.
London reports further success
by the British north of the Ancre
brook and east of Beaucourt. Ber
lin also records the repulse of an
assault on the Somme front west
of LeSars and announces the Brit
ish were forced back westward
along the Flers-Thilloy road and
lost five machine guns.
The entente drive at Monastir,
which has forced the German-Bulgarian
defenders back upon their
inner lines of defense, apparently
has halted. Berlin reports the re
pulse of renewed strong attacks of
entente troops in the Cerna region
and on the Monastir plain. '

REPORT OF RAMMING

Official Statement Received in Washing
ton Says Nothing About Attempt
to Sink the Deutschland.
Washington, D. C, Nov. 71. Official
reports from the collector at New Lon
don contained nothing whatever to sub
stantiate the published report that a hos
tile motor launch attempt to ram the
Mibmersible Deutschland. The German
embassy regarded the accident as espe
cially deplorable because the material

THE DEPARTURE
Germans Attempt to Dislodge British
Who Take Many Prisoners.
London, Nov. 17. The British official
statement last night reads:
"This afternoon the enemy bombard
ed our new front north of the Ancre.
especially in the vicinity of Beaiwourt.
During the past 24 hours we have taken
six officers and 297 men of other ranks
prisoners." r '
EXPECTS MORE GAINS
TtBe Made By Anglo-French on the
. i "v Western Front.
London, Nov. 17. Maj. Gen. F. B.
Maurice, chief director of military opera
tion at the war office, in an interview
with the Associated Press, predicted that
the British gains in the Ancre valley
were only the forerunner of further
equally important advances which will be
made on the western front during the
winter months.
"Our successes on the Ancre," said
Gen. Maurice, "means that we are not
going to give the enemy much rest this
winter. It means that, whenever weather
conditions permit we are going to attack
and subject the enemy to unceasing pres
sure during the coming months so as to
prevent as far as possible the Germans
from establishing themselves in new po
sitions.'
"All the attempts of the enemy to min
imize our success will not explain away
the fact that in three davs the British
troops by the capture of Beaumont and
St. Pierre Divion and the semi-circular
ridge which they dominated have gained
an important strategical advantage.
"This ridge formed a salient jutting
into our lines from the northern bank
of the Ancre. Thus the enemy was able
to direct the fire of his artillery massed
behind it."
American Force on Mexican Border to
Be Reduced to About 100,000
No Change in Government's
Policy.
Washington, D. C, Nov. 17.Five Na
ional Guard regiments were ordered
home from the Mexican border yester
day. They are the First regiment of
South Carolina, Seventh New York,
Third Indiana, Third Wisconsin and
Third Minnesota.
In a statement announcing the order,
the war department said it was in con
tinuation of the policy "announced some
time ago to gradually withdraw National
Guard regiments from the border as con
ditions permit, and, in accordance with
the recommendations of General Funs
ton, these regiments have been ordered
home.
War department officials said the or
der did not. indicate any change of pol
icy or general withdrawal of guardsmen
from the border and had no relation to
the proceedings of the joint conference
at Atlantic City.
Thev said that as rapidly as condi
tions on any portion of the border are
considered by General Fttnston to jus
tify the withdrawal of the troops, the
department intends to bring home addi
tional regiments and release them from
federal service.
Approximatel 100,000 National Guards
men will remain on the border when
these five regiments, with a total
strength of about 6,000, have been withdrawn.

Mr. Garvin, a Republican, was defeat
ed for representative at the recent elec

to Mr. Garvin's room a few minutes be
fore the shooting and asked if there was
anything lie wanted. He replied that be
did not need medicine, and putting his

get for them
The report presented by Secretary
Cummings was as follows:
"The best report Ifan give this year
is to say that the great New England
Fruit show has been l.rld in Vermont
for the first time. We h;ive needed for
many years the encouragement and in
spiration which this event brings. To
most Vermonters the New England Fruit
show has meant but little, for only a
few have seen a great exhibition of
this kind. Every state in New England
has entertained the show, and all have
profited thereby. We take our turn this
vear.
"It has been r.o small task to bring
this great event to pass. It would have
been impossible without the help of
many people. I would mention in par
ticular the Montpelier board of trade,
our state vice-president, George I). Aiken
of Putney, and manv men who gave
money directly or who gave in advertise
ments in the premium list, to make out
the budget for this exhibition and meet
ing. We are also indebted to the va
rious papers 111 the state, and the rural
press outside of Vermont, for the gen
erous space allowed, to acqtiajnt the pub
lic with this extensive enterprise. Our
society and the work that it is trying
to carry t has received more general
publicity t ti is year than in any other pe
riod in its history.
"This great show and the excellent ad
dresses that go with it, are not ends in
themselves. They should serve rather as
a means of encouragement and inspira
tion. We are just grasping the fact that
the needs and opportunities are indeed
very great here in Vermont. We real
ize now what can be done."
Vermont apple growers captured 41
first prizes at the New England fruit
show, which is being held in Montpelier
this week, and leads all New England
states in number of premium's won. Ver
mont growers also won 35 second prizes,
31 third. 10 fourth and three fifth prizes,
which is a most remarkable record.
Maine growers are second with 12 first,
12 second, five third, three fourth and
one fifth prizes.
Massachusetts is third as a winner
with 13 first, 11 second, nine third and
two lourtn prizes. Jthode Island won
three first ami one third prizes, while
Connecticut is a winner of one first, two
second, one third and one fourth prizes.
The sweepstakes prizes were divided

Apple Disease.
On this, the fourth dav of the show,
addresses were given br Prof. B. F. I.ut-
man of the University of Vermont, whose
subject was ''Some Important Apple Dis
eases and How to Control Them," by K.
8. Brigham, state commissioner of agri
culture, who spoke on "rvefoTms in Ver
mont Apple Marketing," and by F. H.
Abbott of Barre, county agent of Wash
ington county, whose subject was "Fruit
Growing in Washington County."
l'rof. Lutz said in part ae follows:
"Weather is. to a large extent, the de
termining factor in the spread of plant
diseases, ine last tnree or lour years
have been rnlher dry during the period
in which fruit was forming and pithy or
gnarly apples seem to be the consequence.
The season of l!)lfi, on the other hand,
was very cold and wet during May and
June and the very serious trouble apple
scab, has reappeared to prevent the pro
duction of perfect fruit.
"Manv growers depending on the ex
perience of the seasons immediately pre
ceding, neglected to give proper attention
to spraying. Kainy weather makes spray
ing a very difficult operation, but since
it is jn such times that the fungus caus
ing scab gets its start, the apples must
be covered and kept covered by the spray
mixtures if they are to escape injury.
I,ime-sulphur mixture (1-101 is still the
standard foliage sprav for scab, but it is
questionable whether an application of
weak Bordeaux (2-2-o0) mixture would
not be preferable under such conditions.
Other diseases that have been unusually
abundant this summer are the twig
blight, eured only by the complete re
moval of the affected portion of the tree;
and the frog's spot on the foliage, con
trolled bv the same sprav as the apple
scab."

BY A RAIL
Edward Nutbrown Struck'
by a Weight Dropping
from Grout Track
TAKEN TO HOSPITAL
IN LOW CONDITION
Accident to Websterville
Man Occurred on Con
solidated Quarry
With a bad fracture near the base of
the skull, Kdward Xutbrown of upper
(iraniteville was brought to the City hos
pital this forenoon after he had sustained
the injury when a rail fell from a grout
road as he was making repairs to a grout
trap in the quarry yard. Xutbrown is on
he dangerous list and his condition this
afternoon was described as precarious.
The man lost, consciousness immediately
after the accident and suffered a hem
orrhage before he was brought to the
lospital. J)r. E. H. Bailev was. called to
the quarry from his home in Graniteville
and after the physician had examined
lie man,' hitcomb s motor ambulance
was summoned from hast Barre and ho
was hurried to the hospital. The acci
dent occurred around 10:30 o'clock.
According to the statement given out
at the company's office near the quarry
this afternoon, Nutbrown and three other
quarrymen were making repairs to a
grout trap in the quarry yard when,
without any warning, a heavy steel rail
rom the inclined grout track overhead
ame toppling down. Nutbrown was
tooping over the grout trap and tho
rail striking him in the back of the head,
rushed it against a block of granite.
The man lost consciousness at once and
nows nothing of the steps taken by hi
ellow employes in an effort to save his
ife. Dr. Hailev, on his arrival at the
uarry, instantly diagnosed the case as a
serious one. Nutbrown lost a consider-
ble quantitv of blood bv hemorrhages
through the ear and nose. At the hos
pital a consultation of doctors was held
nd a decision not to operate was
reached. Owing to the location of the
fracture at the base of the skull, an op
eration sometimes performed to bring
relief to a patient could not be resorted
to, it was said, as the condition of the
skull revealed too manv obstruction.
The injured quarrvman is around 30
ears old and is well known in Barre
Town. He is married and other near
relative besides his wife are his mother,
Mrs. Dennis McCarthy of Graniteville,
nd two brothers, Leonard and William
Xutbrown;

Reforming Apple Marketing in Vermont.
Commissioner Brigham's address on
"Reforms in the Apple Marketing" w
in part as follows:
"It is a well known fact that Vermont
lias great potential possibilities as an ap
ple growing state. The lands and the
climate of our Oiamplain valley have
been pronounced by one of the leading
experts of the country as being ideally
suited to the production of apples. Here
and there in other parts of the state
good growers have demonstrated that our
apple lands.are not confined to th ( ham
plain valley alone but include a good
portion of our territory.
"The results obtained bv our best pro.
ducers demonstrate the possibilities of
securinsr an average crop of satisfactory
size. The price received, by some of our
best growers, r: ,lt ?20 per barrel for
Spys reported by an Addison county
grower, seems to demonstrate the popu
larity of good Vermont apples in the
market.
''What is the trouble? Why are apple
lands within ,100 miles of the market
selling for .1h1 per m-ro. while apple
land on the l'aiilie eoa-t .I.OoO miles
distant sell for more thsn 10 times this
amount? Why do the fruit "tores in our
larger Vermont town sell western fruit
through a greater portion of the apple
reason, and why do our ermont consum

Success in a measure wholly unexpect
ed by its promoters attended the first
night of the Barre A. C. fair in Howland
hall. Also, some hundreds of folks at
tended, folks who are satisfied that tho
B. A. C. bazaar this year is running true
to form and will provide a lot of whole
some amusement for its patrons before
the wind-up comes Saturday. It is the
third annual fair of the club and if "first
night" returns may be used as an indica
tion, it will be the most profitable event
of its kind since the club was organized.
An entertaining program included a vo
cal solo bv Miss Leona Lamb and an un
usually fine exhibition of Highland danc
ing bv Leslie Mercer. The youngster
won his spurs at the Caledonian games
in Boston last summer and added to Ins
laurels at the Clan Gordon fair later in
the season. His performance last even
ing was eminently satisfactory and ho
may be seen again in action before tne
fair is over.
An attractive array of booths at the
north end of the hall furnishes a thriving
feature of this year's bazaar. All the
colors of the prism are enlisted in the
decorative scheme and with pleasing ef
fect, too. There the buyer could pur
chase almost anything that his fancy
prompted him to desire. A bountifully
laden candy counter was in charge of
Mrs. Henrv Tetrie, Mrs. Alfred Morgan
and Mrs. Bert Bartlett. who were assist
ed by Miss Margaret Rhind, Miss Mar
garet Maberinl, Mrs. Silvio Giudici and
Mrs. John Davidson. Knsign James
Barker, late of His Majesty's royal navy.
dictated the movements of those who
competed at the shooting gallery and the
spinning wheel, around which the crowd
was always gathering, was presided over
by ltobert McKiught and Milton Wil
liams. Miss Emma Gerbetti and Miss
Belle Johnson had their hands full at the
confectionery counter and the destinies
of the baseball game were guided for the
most part by David MrKinght.
Much was made of the tcrpisehorean
features of the affair and at the height
of the evening's merrymaking more than
100 couples were on the floor. A com
mittee ron.sisting of Kdward Milne. Fran
cis ( leary and Charles lmlah acted s
floor managers and the musie was by
Carroll's orchestra. F.ach evening there
is to lie a carefully arranged program of
dancing after the entertainment. This
evening the Norwich cadets will make
their third anual bow liefore a B. A. C.
audience and if their achievement a en

they are bound to make a hit regardless
of who attend. In vears past they have
