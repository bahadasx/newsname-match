HOW 10 ACiiUIRE
STATE LANDS
Valuable Information on the
Subject of Purchase of
Lands Held by Stale
of New Mexico
NO
ACREAGE LIMIT SET
FORTH BY DEPARTMENT
Among thu numerous inquines
reaching the Suite Land OIHce,
thoro is none more insistent
than that which pertains to the
prolimhutry proceedings neces
sary to the acquiring of state
lands hy purchase, and for this
wagon the explanation? horoin
given uro very explicit in order
that those unfamiliar with such
matters may ho fully inlormed
on the subject.
In the first place it must ho
understood thai thu 12 million
acres originally granted to the
state of New Mo ;ico, to which
reference is hereinbefore made
under the caption "Finances and
Taxation," were nut set Hside in
any particular sostion of tho
sítate, but have been selected
from unoccupied lands of the U.
S. Government, located in the
various eouiitioa of the stato.
'fne state umii uillco lias no
complete list of those lands for
distribution as it is awaiting fi
nal action hy tho U. S. Govern
ment on approximately three
nulnw a. res whuh have no' y i
boon clear Hp ted, which is
onuivalont to a patent to tho
statu.
Therefore, tho first stop noc
ussary for anyone dosirlng to ac
quire suite lands in New Mexico,
is to make a personal investiga
tion of oithor tho onliro state,
gome county or particularly lo
uality, al the case may tie, and
(locidi upon certain lands ns de
iflfáule for investment. Having
inndo thin personal investigation,
It is necessary, if one is not ac
quainted with land descriptions,
lb have a good surveyor, or some
Other competent person, give
tho exact description of the laud
as to section, township and
range.
Having completad those nec
ossury details, tho next course is
to come to, or communicate with
tlie State Land OfHce, in the
Capital building at Santa Fe, and
Secure regular blanks, furnished
free of charge by thisoltíce, upon
which to make application to
punshMO tho land, and in such
application a description of the
land must U given in accord
tnce with that made by the sur
veyor employed to run the lines;
tÉe application must be properly
signed by the applicant and
Worn to by him before a notary
public. It must be accompanied
by an apBrttisement of the land,
made by a disinterested party;
and ateo At Uio time of making
appUeauoii Ule applicant must
tlgpaglt a sutn sufficient to pay
m goat of advertising mid ox
ping of holding salo. Tiie am-
Oglltof coat varies, depending
ynon uiu qnargua mauo
floaiMi)(ifs, and the
by local
distance
i ruin tho State Capital to the
county seat of the county in
which the lands are located,
which makes n variation in trav-
c..ii' expenses incident to such
sale; Again if a number of sales
are made, tho total oxponso of
advertising and holding sale is
divided among all tho purchas
ers. Individuals sales cost about
seventy-five dollars, but where
a number of snlos are effected at
tho same time the expenso is of
ten reduced to five or ton dollars
each.
After tho application is receiv
ed by the Stato Land Office, an
examination of the land is made
for the purpose of determining
the accuracy of tho appraisement
and also for the further purpose
of ascertaining whether the sale
of tho land so selected will inter
fore with tho sale of the balance
of the tract, providing there is
any such balance. If everything
h satisfactory, notice is then iris
en by publication that this land
will be sold at public auction, as
required hy law.
This notice must ho published
for ten successive weeks in one
newspaper nearest to tho lard
and in another one at tho state
capital for the same length of
time, and must contain a ful' de
suription of tho land, as given
in the application to purchase,
together with thu day, hour and
place of such public auction. Of
course, it is understood that oLh
ers besides tho applicant muy
bid on this land at the time of
sale, and in all casus it will be
sold to the highest bidder. The
purchase-)- of the land is required,
on the day of such purchase, to
pay 4 percent per annum inter
est, one year in advance, on all
deferred payments on the' land,
and one-tenth of the purchase
price, if another titan the orig
inal applicant for the land should
he the purchaser, then the mon
ey deposited with thu State Lund
OiHce to cover expenses of sale,
will be returned to thu original
applicant for the land and the
actual purchaser will be required
to pay such expenses of sale, in
cluding publication o f notice,
ate.
If he prefers to do so the pur
chaser may pay all cash for thu
land at tho time he buys it, or at
any later date and thus secure
his deed without further delay;
or he may take possession of the
land under u contract of sale on
tened into between himsolf and
the Commissioner o f Public
Lends, the terms of which re
quirt an annual payment of 1-30
of the balance duo on the pur
chase prico of the land, and one
year's interest in advance, on all
deferred payments, at the rate
of '1 percent per annum, payable
on the first dav of October of
ouch and every year until the
whole sum is paid, thus giving
the purchaser thirty years in
which to complete his payments,
by simply paying yearly install
ments of equal amounts and thu
intorust o n all unpaid sums.
When lie has completed theso
payments in full ho will receive
a deed from tito stato convoying
an absolutely clear title to the
land.
