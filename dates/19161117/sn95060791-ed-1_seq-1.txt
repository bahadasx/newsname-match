All
State Bankers' Meeting
Judge D. J, Thomas, cashier
of the Merchants & Stockgrowers
bank, returned last Sunday from
Phoenix, where he attended the
thirteenth annual session of the
Arizona State Bankers' Associa
tion which was in session in that
city Friday and Saturday of last
week. He was accompanied
from Phoenix by H. E. Christie,
of the El Paso National bank,
who was Judge Thomas' prede
cessor in the Merchants & Stock
growers bank, resigning his posi
tion about three years aero to ac
cept a place with the El Paso
bank. Mr. Christie remained
here for a day to visit old friends
and then returned to El Paso.
To The News Judge Thomas
stated that the State Bankers'
association was attended by a
large number of representative
bankers of Arizona, New Mexico
and Texas, and the meeting was
a very interesting one, R. E.
Moore, president of the Valley
Bank of Phoenix, was elected
president of the association.
Other officers elected were as
follows:
P. P. Greer, president of the
First National bank of Globe,
vice president; J. H. Todd,
cashier of the Gila Valley Bank
and Trust company of Miami and
J. 1 4-J Z
vjriuue, treasurer, re-eieuueu, auu
Morris Goldwater, president of
the Commercial Trust and Sav
ings bank of Prescott, re-elected
secretary.
A smoker was held at the Ari
zona club at 8:30 o'clock Saturday
night for the visitors. This was
the final event on the entertain
ment program and brought to a
successful close the most interest
ing and educational yearly meet
ever held by the Arizona . State
Bankers' association.
Finish of Motorcycle Race
Roy Artley won his first mo
torcycle road race on an Indian
powerplus last Friday, when he
wheeled into the final checking
station of theSpringerville-Phoe-nix
contest at 2:24 Friday after
noon covering the 441 miles in
13:01. A. T. Bedell, on an In
dian was second in 14:03. Ac
cording to unofficial figures, Joe
Wolters, Excelsior, was third in
17:08 and Jack Dodds, Indian
fourth in 17:19J. It is under
stood thnt that Indian people
will ask a re-check of the times,
in order to be sure that Dodds is
not third, for the times are so
close that an error will change
the disposition of third money,
amounting to over a hundred
dollars.
Not in many years has there
been so tough a road race as this.
But four out of the nine starters
finished, and the time of the
winner was only 34 miles an
hour. This is due to execrable
road conditions.
Erwin G. Baker, who spilled
rather than injure Harry Cran
dall. Thursday, rode as far as
Canyon station on the Black
Canyon road, and then the game
old racer had to give up. He
went to the hotel at the station
and lav down for a rest, with his
right knee-cap so swollen as to
indicate a fracture.
No other rider was hurt in
this, the hardest raee on both
machine and rider that has been
run to the Phoenix fair since
motorcycle road racing became
popular in the state. Artley,
who has set a number of road
records, not in competition, rode
a splendid race. He competed
unsucessfully in the San Diego
Phoenix races of two and three
years ago.
Artley was in the lead when
the racers passed Holbrook
Thursday morning, and evid√©nt
ly maintained his lead into Phoe
nix. My house in Holbrook for sale

prices. Jesse Hulet, Navajo,

Aftermath of the Election
Accurate totals on the vote in
the general election November 7
wiil not be available for several
weeks. In some states where
the vote for presidential electors
was close, the losers state that
contests will be instituted. The
contests are not likely to effect
the result, excepting they may
change the number of electors
secured by President Wilson.
It has been certain since Cali
fornia gave the president a ma
jority that he was re-elected.
Contests might change the re-' appointed a new undersheriff,
suit somewhat, but only in minor land Mr. demons has launched

nearly a half million majority of i to a number of his friends in
the popular vote, The election
demonstrated that a president
can be elected without getting
the vote of New York, a thing
that political dopesters had con
sidered practically impossible.
The senate of the United States
will remain democratic, but the
lower house of congress is still
in doubt, with both democrats
and republicans claiming a ma
jority. The official count in the
states can alone decide.
In Arizona the apparent ma
jority secured by Campbell, the
republican candidate, over Hunt,
democrat, is so small that both
are claiming election. Only the
the official count can decide, and
this will not be started in many
of the counties until next Mon
day. In Navajo county the official
count will not change the result
other than it was changed last
Saturday by the discovery that
O. D. Flake, democrat, had been
elected instead of J, E. Richards,
republican, who had been re
ported with a majority. The
mistake was made in getting the
vote over tne wire from one of
the Winslow precinfc.
In this county it is not likely1
that sufficient evidence of irre
gularity in the voting will be
found upon which to base any
contests. Should contests be
instituted they will probably be
started by Governor Hunt, or
some other state candidate. The
county candidates are satisfied
to abide by the result as shown
on the face of the first returns.
What The West Can Do
Doubtless it is difficult for the
big centers of the east to realize
that they no longer have the
power to elect a president. It is
good for the whole country to
know that New York, New Jer
sey, Indiana, Illinois, Micnigan,
Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and all
of the New England states,
along with Iowa, Minnesota,
South Dakota and Oregon, could
go republican, and fail to elect
their candidate. But more signi
ficant is the fact that if every
state north of the Ohio river and
east of the Mississippi were to
go republican, the south and the
states west of the Mississippi i
can defeat that vote, without
taking Minnesota, which is most
ly west into consideration. Iowa,
South Dakota and Oregon have
twenty-three electoral votes, or
within one vote of Ohio. With
out counting any state -east of
the Mississippi and north of the
Ohio, except Ohio and without
counting Minnesota, Wilson had
a majority of four yotes in the
electoral college, with the states
of Iowa, South Dakota and
gon against him. With
south and the west, not includ
ing Minnesota, a candidate may
be elected with two votes to
spare. Counting Minnesota, he
can have fifteen yotes tornare.
these tacts are going to put a
lot of politicians to figuring, and
in the future there will be less
concentration of effort in New
York, Indiana, and Ohio and
more effort in the states of the
west.
Oregon went for Hughes by a
very small vote, as did South
Dakota, and Iowa is an uncer
tain as Kansas. Whether Minne
sota is for Hughes or Wilson is
not known at this writing.

Dr. Lowell Passes Away
Dr. Percival Lowell, founder
and director of the Lowell ob
servatory at Flagstaff and an
astronomer of international re
putation, died in Flagstaff Sun
day night from a stroke of
apoplexy suffered yesterday
morning.
Dr. Lowell apparently was in
good health when he arrived in
Flagstaff recently from a lecture.
trip.
Dr. Lowell's home was in Bos
ton, where he was born, March
13, 1855, but he came to Flag
staff at certain season for his
studies at the observatory, es
tablished there in 1894, because
of the clearness of the atmos

Dr. Percival Lowell, whose
death at his private observatory
at Flagstaff, Ariz., was reported
Monday was best known as the
principal exponent of the theory
that Mars was inhabited.
Astronomers generally, while
expressing regard for his ability
and enthusiasm, regarded many
of his theories as radical and all
of them were not accepted. Dr.
Lowell was a brother of A. Law
rence Lowell, president of Har
vard university.
It was from the observatory at
Flagstaff that he announced his
discovery of vegetation on Mars,
with the inference that the
planet was inhabited, and his ob
servation of the canals as being
so regular in form as to indicate
they were artificial.

Bank Announces Changes
The officers of the McKinley
County Bank announce that Mr.
T. M, Quebedeaux has sold his
principal interest in the bank to
present stockholders, and while
Mr. Quebedeaux will identify
himself with the First National
Bank of El Paso, he will remain
a director in the McKinley Coun
ty Bank, lending his advice and
assistance, Mr. T- F. Smalling,
who has long been identified
with the bank in various offices,
will now be President; and Mr.
T. E. Purdy will remain as First
Vice-President. Mr. Sam Bush
man, who has been counsel for
the bank for a number of years,
will be more directly associated
Ore-i with Mr. Smalling in the mana
the gement of its affairs as active
Vice-President. Mr. J. A. Purdy
will be cashier, and Mr. H, R.
Mead will be assistant cashier.
The bank will continue its re
lations with the First National
Bank of Albuquerque, and will
continue to pursue its former
policy of doing a banking busi
ness exclusively, with fair,
courteous and equal treatment
of all, and with a view to the
continued development of the
community. Gallup Herald.

New Undersheriff
Sheriff R. L. Newman has ap
pointed C. W. Harp, of Winslow,
undersheriff, in place of W. G.
Clemons who had held the place
for nearly two years. Mr.
Clemons resigned several weeks
ago, having in view starting a
transfer business in Holbrook.
This he has already started.
Mr. Harp arrived in Holbrook
Tuesday evening with his wife
and household goods and is now
established in the undersheriff's
appartments in the court house.
The selection of Mr. Harp as
undersheriff by Mr. Newman is,
in the opinion of the News, a
good one. He has held the posi
tion of night marshal in Winslow
for two years, and part of the
time has held a commission as
deputy sheriff. In both of these
places he has made good, and he
j will no doubt perform the duties
i of his new position in a manner
j acceptable to his superior and to
the public generally.

Cabinet Changes Likely
It is believed that several mem
bers of President Wilson's cabi
net believe that they should re
tire to private life. Mr. Daniels
has enjoyed the honor of his posi
tion for four years, and his paper
in Raleigh needs his attention.
Mr. Baker came reluctantly from
Cleveland to the war depart
ment. He is a young man with
a future to make, and he feels
that his law business needs his
undivided attention. Secretary
Redfield enjoys the lecture plat
form, and he has been consider
ably hampered of late in the
freedom of his expression.

Grazing Fees to be Doubled
District Forester Redington
announced today that on a de
cision of the Forester it is pro
posed to make a one third in
crease in grazing fees effective
March 1, 1917, on all the National
Forests of Arizona and New
Mexico. Further yearly increases
are to be made until 1919, on and
after which double the present
rates are to be charged. The
proposed increases will apply all
over the United States, and have
the approval of the Secretary of
Agricultural, who has set Feb
ruary 1. 1917. as the final date
for public hearings on the new
rates.
Commenting on the proposed
changes, which will affect about
3.900 stockmen in the southwest,
the District Forester made the
following statement: "One of
the leading criticisms the of
National Forests is that they are
not self-supporting. This change
will make them so. It is also
asserted that while timber is
sold at competitive market prices,
the grazing privileges of the
Forests are disposed of at manaly
nominal rates.
It is argued that due to these
low rates Forest stockmen have
an undue financial advantage
over those who must buy or
lease outside lands for their
stock. This advantage is re
flected in the fact that in sales
of Forest stock, where the own
er waives his privilege, the buy
er often freely pays a bonus or
premium over and above the
market value.- Such premiums
have often been as high as $1.50
per head for sheep and $10.00
for cattle."
The present Forest rates, bas
ed on a 48c rate per head per
year for cattle, average, accord
ing to Mr. Re
per cent of the rates
The proposed increase will bring
them to about 66 per cent of
the rates paid on such lands.
It is pointed out that the in
crease in Forest receipts which
will result from higher grazing
fees will rebound to the benefit
of the State roads and schools.
Arizona and New Mexico re
ceive yearly by congressional
enactment 42 per cent of the re
ceipts from the National Forests
for roads and schools. Hereto
fore this fund has amounted to
about $170.000. With the higer
grazing fees, it is expected that
the annual percentage accruing
to the State will be increased by
at least $100,000.
Sufferer From Indigestion Relieved
Before taking Chamberlains's
tablets my husband suffered for

causing him to have pains in the
stomach and distress after eating.

him of these spells right away."
