That the establlsnment of a trans

was done by the Hill interests not to
take trade away from other companies,
but by exploitation to build up trade
for both themselves and others, was

dent of the Great Northern Pacific
Steamship Company at a luncheon
held at' the Commercial Club.
-My company is a pioneer," he said,
"but In pioneering It never wishes to
injure the business of others. The
exploitation which we have done will
bring thousands of people here, and
right now every agent on our 30,000
miles of railroads is talking 'Hawaii.'
