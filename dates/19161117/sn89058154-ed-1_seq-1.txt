Rev. J. W. Carnell
The farewell s irmon of Rev. J. W.
Carnell was preached Sunday night to
a very large and sympathetic audience
He has served the Selmer and Bethel
Springs churches four years, the fall
term that any preacher in the M. E.
church can serve continuously one
congregation.
After a short sermon," time was
givep to anyone who had a word to
say. J. W, Prather read the endorse
ment of the official board and the lay
preachers, giving their retiring
preacher the strongest endorsement
as to character, work and labors in
this field. Rev. J. W. Wallace made
& few remarks fully endorsing the
board's report.
J. W. Purviance, on the part of the
Presbyterian church, next presented,
in his usual earnest manner, the high
regard and Christian love with
which the church as well as himself
individually esteemed Bro. Carnell,
and at the close presented a freewill
oifering to him by the individual mem
bers of the church as personal to
him,- The sum was a nice little
amount, and was highly appreciated
by the recipient.
Rev. J. A. Houston was asked to
come forward and did so, showing
that the most cordial relations had
always existed between him and Bro.
Carnell in the line of each of their
ministerial duties. ,
Rarely does a pastor sever his re
lations with his flock where stronger
ties bind than in this instance.
The church has grown during the
four years from about 65 members
to 160. Owing to the frail health of
Bro. Cornell and that of his devoted
wife, be has been handicapped, and
has borne his afflictions with Chris
tian fortitude. His expenses for med
ical aid tor himself and family have
been heavy. But withal, he leaves the
work with a consciousness of the best
he could do, and has the universal
affection of all of our people, regard
less of church relations.
' Sad Accident
While Dew ucas, aged about 17
years, and Cooksey, about the
same age, were hunting near their
homes about 2 miles south of Adams
ville Tuesday afternoon, Lucas was
shot accidentally by Coofoey. who
was behind him, when his gun caught
, a vine and was discharged, shooting
Lucas in the leg, severing the artery.
The blood was not checked until he
died, about two hours afterwards.
Doctors did not reach him until it
was too late.
- The deplorable accident cast a
horror in that neighborhood, as both
the boys belong to good families and
were worthy young men.
Selmer, Tenn., Nov. 10. 1916.
Editor Independent: -
Under the influence of glorious
Tennessee November weather, the
greeting of kindred and old-time
friends, and the generous spread for
me upon their tables, I am beginning
to feel that .the great world
outside ought to know more about
this section. Before the clouds of
forgetfulness cover the old memories
and the names of those that are not,
Uia wellto recall the early settlers
of this nalurally favored county, and
to keep alive the associations of othes
days. " May their graves long remain
green and undisturbed by the Jugger
naut of progress, and. may their
moral and physical worth still temper
the ambition of their descendants
who still, fortunately, hold character
as something more important than
wealth, and honesty and piety as of
more worth- than great riches.
But to-day, while we still honor the
early settlers of McNairy, and our
tncestors whose blood flows in our
veins, we must set our faces to the
future, and help lay the foundations
of a solid prosperity fo our people of
to-day and our descendants that are
to take our place. The county of
McNairy has always since its organ
ization supported a good population,
but many of them have gone, and are
ptill going, to other places in search
of wealth and position. The great
question now is: How are we going
to keep our people here, and add to
the present population by inducing
other to come? What are we going
to do with these broad acres in order
to make the best use of the land and
the climate with which this section
has abundantly been blessed? Shall
more cotton, corn, or other farm pro
ducts be planted? Or shall new re
sources be developed?
I know what some of my old frienda
will say: "Oh, yea, the boy means
well, and thinks he knows it ail, but
he can't come down here every five or
ten years from the great city and tell
us how to run our farms. We don't
want any book farming here; we
know how to run our farms by prac
tical experience, and, don't want to
hear any theories." Well, it may be
natural for them to think that way,
but lots of them feel', nevertheless,
that they are cot exactly on the right
track, and would like to know how
to better their output from the farm,
and make more and surer money with
less labor, and, above all, to keep
their best boys and girls from going
away to seek their luck elsewhere.
Some of the wisest and most prac
tice McNairians with whom I have
been talking agree that the raising
of first-class live stock is the best and
most promising field for the McNairy
farmer at the present time. They re
alize that the cotton bell weevil is a
very VeSent menace to the favorite
money crop of McNairy, and ; that
twenty cent cotton will not do to de
pend on. A great strike or a monop
oly for war purposes of the transpor
tation systems would knock the bot
tom out of the best cotton market;
the white staple would pile up under
the sheds, and it could not be eaten.
Corn, meat and eggs they are the
great staples to tie to, and let things
come as they may, these things are
safe to raise. ,
No naturally good stock-growing
country like that of McNairy has
such,, cheap lands; farms that are
well watered, near to market, and
that can bring all the feed nncessary
to raise the finest cattle hogs and
poultry in the South. I have walked
to-day over miles of grand farm lands
near Selmer, through which never-
failing spring-fed streamlets wend
their crystal course, and on which,
without manuring, the Jail stalks of
corn hang heavy with big ears. . I
can see, in my minds eye, big herds
of fat polled Angus cows and steers,
droves of big Berkshire pigs, and
thousands of snow-white Leghorn
pullets decorating these hillsides and
rich bottoms, and car-loads of choice
products of the biggest etock farm in
Tennessee moving from Selmer to the
great markets in the North and West.
I can see lots of well-dressed pros
pectors alighting from the trains and
enquiring the way to that stock farm,
and to the real estate office where
some more of that stock-raising land
can be bought. I can imagine the
swelling bank deposits, the increasing
number of handsome dwellings and
stores, and the improved roads and
schools of the county; the long en
thusiastic articles in the big stock
journals about what McNairy is doing
for the live stock market, and the
steady increase in value of all farm
ing lands in the county.
How to go about it: Now it would
not become me to go too much int?
details. That should b.e left to those
who know about local conditions and
the minds of the. The best I can do
is to set them to thinking, remind
them of their splendid resources, and
bid them get busy. But a few words
as to how and when I would begin

The tablet form of this old
reliable remedy makes it possi
ble for you to check any illness
at the very onset It is a safe
guard against coughs, colds and
other catarrhal conditions, no
matter what symptoms "are
manifest"1 ' Catarrh is an inflamma
tion of the mucous membrano that
lines the breathing apparatus and
the digestive apparatus. PERUNA
relieves catarrh. In tablet form it is
EVER-READY-TO-TAKE
Its prompt action makes it in
valuable for men and women ex
posed to sudden changes in the
weather or compelled to be out in
slush and rain. ,
It will also be found most satis
factory as a tonic following an at
tack of illness.

wltereveryougo. Travelers and others eom
pelled to toka long drives in the cold and
anyone whose occupation subjects him to
the danger of sudden colds may use it as a
preventive with the assurance that the
tablet? made are from the same formulary
88 1 lip liquid medicine with its 44 years of
success before the American Public

may do no harm. . ' '
"There are several large land owners
in Selmer. Some of them might get
together, form a stock company of
say $50,000 capital, 500 shares of
$100 apiece. They can put in their
land at so many shares, and let the
others put up the money, all of which
does not have to be paid at once If
necessary, let the company borrow
money through the new rural credit
system which allows repayment on
easy terms and at low interest.
You have your land, say 2.000
acres. Get some first-class breeding
stock, and start first with scrub sows
and cows. Get an up:to-date man
ager, who ought to be able to take
some stock himself. Raise all the
feed possible, put the manure back
on the land, and see how beautifully
live etock and farm fertility will
work together. Call on the federal
8nd state departments of agriculture,
the bureaus of plant and animal in
dustry at Washiogton, and other
available sources for all possible in
formation, and upon the bureau of
markets at Washington to learn
where best to sell the products.
These are the ontlines work out the
details for yourpelves. -'
Now (don't laugh!) one McNairy
boy wants to raise scrub goats, which
will live on the undergrowth and clear
it up, without feeding, and bring two
crops of young annually. The kid
hides, flesh, etc., are worth money,
and even the fragrant billies, if you
can endure them, have a steady mar
ket value. You would want at least
500 acres to keep the billies on, un
less you: wanted to depopulate the
neighborhood, but they will thrive on
the cheapest land, and cost nearly
nothing to feed. ' .
Hard times have been predicted, to
follow the close of xhe great war
in Europe. But no matter how hard
the times, meat and bread will have
to be supplied, and this county can
do it as few can in this state. I hope
to see my old county become famous
for its beef, pork, eggs and chickens,
to say nothing of milk, butter, and
breadstuff's. The question is: Can
you people get together and utilize
what you have right now in your,
hands? Can you stick together, bury
little personal differences, and work
for your own good and that "of the
county, keep up .with the latest ad
vances in stock v farming, dynamite
the old gullies, keep others from
making, and make he Departmen' of
Agriculture itself sit up arid take
notice? . Or shall the gullies deepen
and multiply with the indifference of
the people, and the younger genera
tion seek ' fields green and pastures
new" where the farmers are up ,to
date, until McNairy sinks to the level
of other forgotten and depopulated
places? There are fifty men in this
town that couM solve this problem
in six months. Will they do it?
