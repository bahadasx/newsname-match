William H. Stubblefield Jr.,
bank
president, finance chairman of the one
urn Forsythe evangelist tabernacle
and leader of the dry-wing of the Cape
County Democratic party, last night
j i resided as toast master at a campaign
dinner at the St. Charles Hotel.
The dinner or rather banquet was
given by E. F. Loveh, general sales
nud of the Worrell Mfg. Co., of St.
Louis, in honor of the Missouri County
Clerics who are holding a three-day
convention in the Cape.
Mr. Stubblefield's eyes twinkled as,
over in one corner of the large dining
. . I
room,
corks began popping and there
was the delicate tinkle of glasses as
the process of "filling up" started in
his direction.
The waiter approached with the
quart bottle of champaign, immacu
lately enveloped within a towel so
that just the gurgling mouth was ex
posed, stopping at each guests's elbow
to let the clear fluid sparkle and foam
into the high-stemmed glasses.
The banker's jaw sagged and his
tyes were austere when the towel-clad
bottle neaied his place. Nearby George
E. Hackmann, State Auditor-elect and
secretary of the County Clerks' Asso
ciation, allowed a smile to begin be-
ileum nis diuck inuMn.c
.ioples clear out to his ears, as the
fmni Vin tie-ni lis of the i
Wlllt ULOUIl UjJ iiui" i"1- i
champaign glass in front of him.
Mr. Stubblelield filled up with grape
juice and went ahead with his job as
tuastmaster.
Nearly two score guests attended
the affair, when Mr. Hackmann deliv
ered one of the principal talks. He
declared that the clerks' association
and annual conventions make for effi
ciency und said he is convinced that
he obtained much benefit from his con
nection with the county clerks' organ
ization. He likewise toasted the hospitality
of the Cape in his address. Others
who nia'do short talks were
.1. W. Harrington, president, of
Flatte County; Charles B. Johnson,
DeKalb County, first vice president;
Forrest Smith. Ray County, second
vice president; John L. Likins, Greene
County, third vice president; D. B.
Kunkel, Holt County, assistant secre
tly, and John A. Miller, Andrew Coun
ty, treasurer.
The clerks will finish their conven
tion this afternoon with the election of
officers and selection of the next meet
ing place, as well as the adoption of
resolutions. St. Louis has been urged
as the next meeting place.
TO BOWL IN ST. LOUIS NOV. 22
Cape Team Will Make tl.e Trip to
Compete Against Chicago Men.
V. F. Oberheide, treasurer of the
Cape Howling League, yesterday aft
ernoon received a schedule of the Mid
West Bowling tournament that will
be held in St. Louis which shows that
the team from the Cape has been
scheduled to roll next Wednesday
evening.
Oberheide and a team of five or six
men will make the trip to St. Louis
to enter the tournament. At the same
time that the Cape aggregation is
scheduled to bowl, three Chicago teams
will be on the alleys and a couple
teams from other places.
It has not been definitely determin
ed who will make the trip from the
Cape, but the personnel of the team
will be made known in a few days, as
soon as Oberheide can find out from
the men whether 6r not they can go.
Several thousands of dollar will be
awarded in prizes at the'eiose of the
tournament. The date for the Cape's
bowling falls upon Oberheide's birth-day.

been made up, but the could not
from that whether it had been occu

because it wah Christine's practue
not to make up her bed until just be

house dress and a nightgown.
The blue dress and a hat to which
Christine also had an aversion had dis
appeared. The parents and sister con
cluded, they say, that she had taken
a tram for Florida, to lorestaii nei
father's plan of having Magdalene ac
company her, as she resented the im
plication that she needed care.
Her father wanted to make in-
quiries, but Magdalene reminded him
that Christine already felt herself dis
graced by her stay at the sanitarium
and would never forgive them if they
caused a commotion over her depar

letter they thought would soon come.
Christine had gone away twice before
without disclosing her plans, and, as
she had spent last winter in Florida,

would find her way there.
But, while they waited for a letter,
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Haines, rowing
across the Vermillion, which flows
sluggishly a block from the Diemer
