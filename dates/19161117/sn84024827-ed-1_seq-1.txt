NEW LONDON. Nov. 16. Shortly
tefore midnight the. great steel net
that guarded the entrance to the poc

dozen sailors from the Willehad join
ed the force of guards and all persons
were warned to keep away from the

Rumor of Dynamite
Some excitement was caused early
In the evening when the report was
circulated that a man with a stick of
dynamite had eluded the guards and
entered the stockade which guards
the Deutschland. The police said the
incident had not been reported to

The Deutschland passed the U. S.

,By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 16. An ap
peal for active intervention by the
United States to stop the deportation
of Belgian workmen into Germany
was presented to the state department
today by E. Havenitz, the Belgian
minister. The Belgians, Mr. Haven
itz says, are being compelled to fight
against their own country, contrary
to the laws of nations and humanity.
The American government already
has interested itself In this situation
and Charge Grew of the embassy at
Berlin has been instructed to discuss
it personally with Chancellor rnn
Bethmann-Hollweg.
Mr. Havenitz submitted the follow
ing communication to the slate department:

ATLANTIC CITY, Nov. 16. All ef
forts of the American representatives
j on the American-Mexican joint com
mission to persuade Luis Cabrera,
' chairman of the Mexican represents- j
tion to abandon his opposition to the
' plan of bord'.T control approved in
, general by his colleagues failed today,
j The other menbers of the coramiss-
ion had not lost hope tonight and the
; conference will be continued, but
there was absent the note of optimism
which characterized the close of the
sessions yesterday.
Cabrera Is Silent
Mr. Cabrera met with the commis
sion today for the first time since
Tuesday. The fact that he had bit
terly opposed the agreement sanc
tioned Tuesday by Ignacio Bonillas
and Alberto J. Pani, the other Mexi
can representatives and that while he ,
was out of the city yesterday Mr.
Bonnillas and Mr. Panl again offered
their support to the plan, resulted in
peculiar interest being attached to his
reappearance on the commission to
day. '
It was believed possible he might
yield to the importunities of his col
leagues and bring the discussion to
an amicable close. Bfore they 'left
their room tonight after a long ses
sion, the commission agreed that they
. ould say nothing regarding th day's
' talk. Mr. Cabrera met the newspap
er men and told them he had agreed
"not to say one word" to the press.
A few minutes later Secretary Lane,
chairman of the American commis
sion, supported Mr. Cabrera with a
similar statement.
Plans Are Thwarted E
It became known however, that the
entire day was spent in argument to
convince Mr. Cabrera of the advisa
bility of endorsing the plan and to
make clear to him the danger In
which the continued opposition might
place his government. Mr. Cabrera
was ready with counter-suggestions
which, it is understood, are regarded
by the Americans as impossible for
them to accept. All as ready for the
formal preparation of an agreement.
There had been forwarded from Wash
