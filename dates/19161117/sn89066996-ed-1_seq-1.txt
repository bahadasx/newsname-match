Some Strong
i . .
Recommendations
The Times management has recent
ly read copies of the Marshall, Mo..
'Scmocrat-News and tho Macon, Mo.
Times-Democrat, both of which pa
pers have most complimentary men
ion of the management of State Hos
tiital No. 4, located in this city, under
he management of Superintendent G.
E. Scrutchfield. We were exceedingly
trteased to read the strong endorse
ments presented by these representa
tive Democratic newspapers, for while
we know that such endorsements are
lot overdrawn, the fact that the unus
ual record that has been mado in that
institution, is what makes those en
dorsements so full of interest to us.
We would like to publish in full
these strong recommendations of the
jresent management ol .state Hospital
No. 4. hut their length precludes this.
We will, therefore, have to be content
cvtrncts from those arti
cles. The Democrat-News says:
"The Doctor's visit, just at )
.ime, after having gotten 14 blue rib
nons on garden and farm products at
Sedalin and St. Louis, in competition
with the best gardeners and farmers
of St. Louis county and the entire
State, recalls to our mind the many
ood things we have heard about No.
i during the past three or four years,
mder Dr. Scrutchfield's administra
tion." The following brief extract is from
the Times-Democrat, which devotes
more than a column on the front page
to the subject: "Dr. Scrutchfield is
exceedingly anxious that a bill, which
will be presented before the next Leg
islHfaire. takincr the eleemosynay in
stitutions out of pelitics should be
come a law.
He hopes that with the
elecetion of Col. Gardner as Governor i
'hat tho greatest emciency win mi-
:iere in those institutions. Col. Gard- J
ler is a believer in efficiency, and has ,
stated that the same system which is
n vogue in a carefully managed and i
successful business snail ne useu
the affairs of State."

G. F. Schliesser .
Loses Hand
Last Friday morning about 9 o'clock
G. F. Schliesser, miller at the Farm
ington Milling Co.'s mills, had the
misfortune of getting his left hand
raiio-Vit het.ween the rollers of a corn
roer and so badlv crushed that it had
to be amputated just above the wrist.
jje was attempting to adjust a piece
0f lcather in the roller box, when his
f00j slipped, throwing him forward
an j hjs fingers slipped in between the
rollers and his whole hand was drawn
in and crushed almost to a pulp. His
j hand probably locked the rollers
causing the driving belt to slip and
i thus stop the machinery. As soon
as he could be released from his pain-
! ful position a physician was called and
wncre i)r- Watkins, assisted by Drs.
,unc ...Lull tn 1 hi. MAVIS Kl.S I .I .
Rohinson and Graves, amputated t ;e
injured hand.
Mr. Schliesser, who is about 41 years
of age, has been working for the
Farmington Milling Company about
2G years, five or six years as mill boy
and for the last 20 as millor, except
about one year which he spent in Ill
inois. His many friends sympathize
with him in his severe loss, and hope
for his speedy recovery. Though
maimed he will probably not be in
capacitated from following his oc
cupation of milling.
Charged With
Embezzlement
Deputy Sheriff Sam Matthews, of
Sapulpa, Okln., arrived in Farming
ton last Fridav morning with a war
rant for the arrest of Chas. Lewis,
on a charge of embezzlement. The
offense charged is alleged to have been
committed in that citv within tne
past few months. The Oklahoma of
ficer located Lewis at the home of his
parents, near Farmingtcn. Matthews
had come by way of Jefferson City,
where he had secured a requisition
from Gov. Major for the return of
Lewis to that State to answer to the
charge against him.
Lewis was found at the home of
his parents, and the Sapulpa officer
started back with" him the same af
ternoon. Before leaving here, how
ever, Peter Lewis, father of Charles,
and one of our good and respected
citizens, made arrangements with the
Farmers Bank here to fix the matter
up with the parties concerned at Sa
pulpa. The Times knows nothing of
the status of the case against young
Lewis, or how guilty he may have
been of wrong-doing, but he will
doubtless return home soon with add
ed experience and a keener discern
ment between right and wrong.
Auto Accident
As Wm. Fingers of Doe Run was
motoring to Bonne Tere last Friday,
accompanied by Mrs. Fingers and her
sister, Miss Laura Richeson, the car
was overturned, and Miss Richeson
sustained n broken leg, and Mrs. Fin

end that the public may be infinitely
benefited
The following petition, which was
numerously and unfailingly signed by
every citizen to whom it was present
ed, was dispatched on Monday to the
State Public Utilities Board at Jef
ferson City, asking for relief and re
dress from wrongs that have been
forced upon this community. It is
the duty of the Board to give heed to
this petition, and there is no reason to
doubt that they will do so:
"Farmington, Mo., Nov. 13, 1916.
"To the Honorable Board of Public
Utilities, Jefferson City, Missouri:
"Gentlemen: The St. Francois Coun
ty Railway, organized under the laws
of Missouri as an Electric Line, is be
ing operated and controlled by the M.
R. & B. T. Railway, and as such is
not giving the citizens of Farmington
the service due them under its char
ter as a Street Railway in this, to-wit:
"It does not run its cars through the
entire city to connect with the three
daily trains going north on the M. R.
& B. T. R. R., but it does run them
from its depot in the city of Farm
ington to connect with said trains
until a few months ago it ran cars
on the Electric Railway on its entire
line in the city to make connections
with trains on the M. R. & B. T. R. R.
going north.
"In changing its mode of doing bus
iness, citizens living on or near its
line between tho depot in Farming
ton and the city limits near the State
Hospital are put to great hardship in
being compelled to go to tho depot in
order to make trains going north on
tho M. R. & B. T. R. R.
"If the M. R. & B.T. R. R. by its
control of the Electric Line can com
pel patrons of the Electric Line to go
to a depot in order to make connec
tions with the M. R. & B. T. R. R.r
then we contend that the Electric Line
becomes an ordinary railroad and a
part of the M. R. & B. T. R. R. sys
tem, which can charge but two cents
per mile for passenger service, where
ns now they charge thirty cents be
tween Farmington and Flat River, a
distance of not over nine miles.
"If it is a street car line, let all the
cars run through the entire city.
"We therefore respectfully ask your
honorable bodv to investigate the
.viiumuiv. nv.uj ....v.b.. -.
tanner cars are being operated in the
in
citv
ity of Farmington on said Electric
, . ,!!, x 1 1
line and grant us such relief as the
facts and law warrant."
But while the Public Utilities Board
is on the grounds making an investi
gation into the merits of the above
complaint (they doubtless will be
compelled to make a personal investi
gation in order to arrive at a com
plete understanding of the conditions
complained of) The Times believes it
will be of almost equal importance,
to the people of Farmington and vic
inity, that they also investigate the
service of the Lead Belt and Farming
,ton Telephone Company, especially as
to its service in Farmington, where
the equipment is old and superanu
ated', being absolutely inadequate of
rendering good service. pie will not omy expect, out win umum
By such an inspection the Board of them for, a just relief from this ex
Public Utilities can "kill two birds ccssive and unjust burden.
FATHER, FORGIVE THEM"
Editor Farmington Times:
. Now that the election is over, I de
sire space in your valuable paper to
reply to some of the statements and
slanders that have, within the past
few weeks, appeared against me in
The Farmington News. I also wish to
offer a few suggestions to the editor
of that paper, which, if conscientious
ly followed, will enable him to live
mu'-h closer to the Savior, whom he
professes to be so desirous of serving.
It has long been knwn that The
Farmington News would rather villify
a man they thought, or even hoped
was, down and out, than to grant him
an honest hearing. It would rather
kick than help what it considered the
"underdog" Furthermore, while it
pretends to be an ultra "dry" advo
cate, I hereby make the positive state
ment that a Republican candidate,
for any office, was never "wet" enough
. to fail to get its earnest support. This
1 was true even oi Congressman Meei-,
er, who abused and villified the best
people of this county mist unmerci-
1 f ullv when he was trying to chent our ,
pcnle out of a fair expression of their
' opittion on the "wet" and "dry" fifht. i
R it- true that in my younger days
I foll' ved to a considerable extent I
the " 1 rf 'he flesh." Yes, I wasj
ccr.viftei orce. But I have confessed
mv s:r.a. Cnn the News editor say as

, n'ofessed to have confessed h's sins? j
While ' do not yet profess to be a;

with one stone." Neither will a sat
isfactory investigation into the tele
phone service that is being rendered
in this city require any more of their
time than they care to give it. They
can get practically all the information
tnev mav desire on this subject from
an of the manv who are reuuired to
:rk";;
writer has never heard a rc-
" ".". i-o..,
into anvinintr even approacmnir
comp liment of any feature of the nr
vice that is generally supposed to be
rendered by telephone companies; but
wejiavo heard hundreds of criticisms
of the "service" for which this com
pany is collecting good money from
the people none of which was par
ticularly gentle.
Perhaps one of the worst things in
regard to the inefficiency that sticks
out bo glaringly in regard to this tel
ephone company is 'that, not being
satisfied with an abnormally high
rent, even if the service was good,
this company insists in collecting at
least one extra toll for every call to
the Lead Belt. And we say "one" ad
visedly. This reminds us that we have
heard of the strife that arose some
years ago in regard to the charging
r rttru tnll hptween Karmincton
and the Lead Uelt. inc upshot pi
. . .. .
that little disagreement resulted in
the formation of another telephone
company, which gave free service be
tween this city and the Lead Belt, un
til the "monopoly" bug got into the
system of the new company, which
resulted in their absorbing the el
der concern and then the Lend Belt
toll was again tacked on and has
been on ever since.
We believe the telephone user-i of
this community arc becoming rs
greatly aroused over the abuses to
which they have long been subjected
by the inefficiency of such service as
they were when the competing tele
phone system was installed, and aic
ready to go to as great lengths in oii
der to secure relief from what many
are free to call a "hold-up." But. their
indignation need not lead tham in the
same direction. The State Public
Utilities Board's duty is to afford just
this relief. All that should be neces
sary in order to get prompt and
thorough action from this Board is in
formation that things are not alto
gether right with some public utility,
and the Board will doubtless insert its
investigation noint forthwith.
We know and thoroughly under
stand that this . telephone company
has been offering, as a sort of an off
set to all complaints, that they were
on the eve of making extensive im
nrovements in their service. Such ex
cuses have been offered ever since the
writer has lived in Farmington

regulating this old, old trouble, The
Times believes it would be absolutely
just, right and fair to compel the tel
ephone company to refund to its pa
trons, either in cash or in added ser
vice, a fair rebate for the big over
charge they have long been extorting
from their patrons. Surely if a large
portion of the money that has been
collected for "telephone rents" has
been excessive, then the one way to
make amends is to see that the ex
tortionate amount is returned to its
rightfuL owner. The Times believes
lh,. Public Utilities Board has it in
their power to see that such an order
, is complied with, and our good pco-
saint, I defy anyone to prove that I
have ever violated my oath of office
during the past twelve years that 1
have been serving the people of St.

Drops Dead
Adam McDermont, an old man,
aged 81 years, 6 months and 15 days,
dropped dead on the 8th inst., while
carrying in an armful of stovewood
at the home of his son, Lawrence
McDermott, at Doe Run. Mr. McDer
mott, who lived in West Virginia,
came here several months ago to make
his home with his son. An inquest
was held over the body and the ver
dict was that he died of neuralgia of
the heart.

I hereby desire to express my
thanks for the liberal support given
me in my race for re-election for
Circuit Judge.

The Tabulates
Official Returns
On the sixth page of this issue of
The Times appears the complete tab
ulated official returns of the late elec
tion in St. Francois county. While
this table may appear, to the casual
observer, to ,bc the same as the one
published last week in this paper,
there are, in fact, many canges re
quired by the official count. While
none of the changes are material, in
sofar as they affect the election of the
various candidates, there is this dif
ference: These figures correctly give
the official count, while those given
last week were the most correct that
it was possiblo to give until the offi
cial count was completed Saturday af
ternoon. A perusal and comparison of this
able, with that published last week,
wilW show many corrections in the
figures. This table will prove to be
invaluable for future reference, and
should be carefully preserved. T'.ie
numerous corrections, cuused princi
pally by the "absent" vote, made it
necessary to re-set the entire table,
which was no small job. We believe
Times readers will appreciate the ex
tra work done in order to supply them
with the correct county vote.

Public School Notes
The Farmington Public Schools
closed on Tuesday evening, the 14th,
until Monday morning, the 20th, on
account of the State Teachers' meet
ing that convenes in St. Louis this
week. All Farmington teachers are
t ,.,.1 i,... : W i l i 1 1 l 1 1 1 i '
visiting in the St. Louis schools. The
St. Louis schools are ranked among
the hiehest in America today, and our
teachers tili doubtless receive much
benefit from observing work therein.
The North Ward Teachers raised
the indebtedness on their playground
apparafcs by arranging to receive
clectifjf returns at the Monarch Thea
tre on the night of election day, and
selling refreshmenK therewith. Cour
tesies extended to them by Messrs.
Willaid Rariden and J. J. Croke made
the undertaking possible and a finan
cial success, for which the teachers,
patrons and pupils are sincerely
thankful.

Several boys of the Farmington
High School foot ball team, assisted
by four foot ball enthusiasts, journey
ed to Cape Girardeau on last Friday
night and played the Cape Normal
team on the Cape Normal grounds on
Saturday. The team was accompa
nied by Mr. J. S. Dearmont, coach of
the H. S. team. He reports that
though the Farmington athletes were
defeated by the score of 40 to 0, the
game was much more evenly contested

gains through or around the line of

means of the forward pass, advanced

four well-earned touch-downs. The

suited in an even break for the teams
and ended with the score tied, 18 to I
18. At that time it was a toss-up who
should win, but it seems that during
the first half Farmington had solved
the style of play used by Festus, and
when the second half began Festus
was surprised by Farmington scoring
three field goals in rapid succession,
and putting them on the defensive on
every part of the court. It was Farm
ington's game from that time to the
end of the game. Mr. Fleming's care

Noteworthy
Ratification
Saturday night witnessed a splen
did and most gratifying ratification
of the recent sweeping Democratic
victory through-put the Nation, State
and St. Francois county. The jollifi
cation, however, was more particu
larly to celebrate the overwhelming
victory of St. Francois county, where
a substantial Republican victory of
two years ago was converted into the
election of a full Democratic county
ticket by average majorities of about
700.
The triumphal march through the
county started from Desloge, with but
slight notice. From there a long line
of automobiles, all heavily loaded,
speeded to' Bonne Terre, where they
wore enthusiastically received, and
where scores of other automobiles
joined in the procession. On the
return to Desloge, St. Francois and
Flat River, the procession had stretch
ed out into miles of length. The en
tire route was fringed With people
who had been acquainted with what
was coming by the blowing of thou
sands of horns, which drowned the
chugging of the autos.
At Flat River particularly was the
enthusiastic reception at fever heat.
Here thousands of people turned out
to receive and welcome the paraders,
and the spectacle was Ji most inspir
ing one. But they could not linger
there long, as the parade was sched
uled to reach Farmington at 8:30
o'clock. But the intervening ten
miles slipped quickly by, and the ad
vance guard of the long procession
rolled into the public square to the
minute as per schedule. In a few min
utes all the streets around the square
were clogged with automobiles, and
the court house lawn was crowded
with thousands of rejoicing citizens,
bent on giving expression to their de
light in the splendid victory that had
been accomplished.
The paraders brought with them a
band, which was installed in the band
stand and added splendid music to
the din of rejoicing. After the re
joicing had somewhat quieted to a
semblance of order, Benj. H. Marbury,
who had been repeatedly called for,
mounted the stand and made a few
brief remarks, in which he thanked the
voters and citizens of the Lead Belt
for their somewhat unexpected visit
and demonstration, which was an ex
ceedingly creditable exhibition of the
sweeping Democratic victory in the
County, State and .Nation, tie was
only sorry that the Democrats of this
community had not sufficient notice
of their coming to make adequate ar
rangements for their iiore suitable
reception. ,
The procession then continued their
line of march, returning to the start
ing point at Desloge, where the cel
ebration was completed in fitting man
ner. It was a jollification in every
way fitting of the splendid Democrat
ic victory, and it is a safe prophecy
that nowhere in the entire State has
there, been a greater outpouring of
real heartfelt enthusiasm and re
joicing. Shoots Herself
Mrs. Lydia Hall, wife of Charles
Hall, committed suicide at her home
at Golftown last Thursday by shoot
ing herself through the head with a
pistol. Mr. Hall had left home for
his work at 7 o'clock that morning,
and she was alone in the house. On
his return home about 4 o'clock in the
afternoon, he found his wife sitting
on the floor dead with her head rest
ing on a chair. She had evidently
been dead several hours. It is sup
posed that she sat down on the floor,
leaned her head against the chair, and
placing the muzzle of the pistol
against her right temple fired the fa
tal shot. The ball passed diagonally
through her head, lodging in the
brain just back of the left ear. No
cause is known for her act except
that she had been in poor health for
a couple of years and was very de
spondent. She was in hefi 52d year,
and leaves, besides her husband, three
children, the youngest 18 years of
age, to mourn her tragic death.

wanted to die, and as a confirmation
of her desire she resi-ted the treat-

that her mind has undergone a change
that she will think better of it here
after.
