-O HIGH SCHOOL NEWS
A star of another color was
placed upri the Attendance-Pun-'
culitft Banner this week. It was
awarded to Miss Barton's room,
the 5th A and 6th grades as they
had the highest average. This
is the highest average yet obtain
ed. All the teachers and students
are to be praised for their at
temp . to raise the.'r average in
order to obtain the banner. The
punctuality was remarkable, for,
although there might have been
twice lfloO tardies during the en
tire week, morning and noon,
there only 18 and these were
made by only 7 students. Below
are the general averages for the
week:
Miss Barton
Miss Pelly

Miss Parker
Miss Prater
-99.00
-98.43
-97.48
97.20
-96.00
-96.07
-92.58
This makes four different color
ed stars on the banner: Prof.
Faulkner, gold; Prof. Oldfield,
silver; Miss Pelly, red and Miss
Barton, yellow. It is hard
to guess who will have it next
week, they are all keeping so
close togather.

Bessie Holt Dead.
Mrs. Bessie Holt, who was
shot Thursday night, the 9th
inst, died Monday morning from
the gunshot wounds received
from Charles Randalls, who is
now in jail awaiting trial.
This in our judgment is the
worst piece of murder that has
been committed in the County.
The case of Mrs. Robt. Broughton
was bad indeed, but she was
killed for money. This woman
a stranger who had only been
here for a little while, possibly
less than a month, was cruelly
murdered for nothing, and that
too while she was alone in the
world, her husband having gone
to their former home at Moiris
town, Tenn., to bring the little
earnings they had saved up to
their little home where they
had come to live.
We have tried to uphold the
good name of Knox County and
her citizens, and have refrained
from publishing the few bad
deeds that have been done, but
when it comes to a case like this
we believe that the world should
kn"w it, and we believe that the
officers and citizens as well,
should wake up, and at once put
down such foul murders as this
by giving the guilty the full
benefit of the law. Not until
this is done will we be any better
off than we are now. We hope
that those who have the control
of these matters will leave no
stone unturned.
Some Things New
And Entertaining.
The Ladies Aid of the Christian
Church will hold a Ladies' Ex
change for one day only, Dec. 12,
in Miss Sallie Hoskins' Millinery

Here you will find all the at

Hon. Jesse D. Tuggle.
Mr. Tuggle is being urged to
enter the race for the ollice of
County Juuge of Knox County.
He is well known to all citizens
of Knox County. He has served
the County twice as County At
torney and has made success at
the practice of law. He would
not accept the office for the
money there is in it .but for the
love of the people and to get the
County out of debt. He would
sacrifice four years of his valu
able time from the practice at
bar, to serve the people whom
he loves.
Democrats Losing
Grounds In Louisville
According to the returns of the
last election the Democrats of
Louisville lost considerably in the
recent election, their majority
being only 454. The City of
Louisville is now, and has been
for a long time Republican, and
we predict that at the next fall's
election it will go overwhelmingly
Republican.
Water Company
Makes Improvements.
Barbourville Water Company
is now installing a 150.000 gallon
concrete reservoir at the pump
station where they will store the
deep well water that will be taken
from there by the big pumps to
the reservoir on top of the moun
tain. The new franchise has
been bought for a period of twen
ty years and they are now mak
ing such improvements as will
keep them in the front rank of
other towns in this section of the
state.
They are also making a 400
feet extension oh the line down
Allison Avenue and 400 feet on
SchoolStreet. Theyarepiessing
the work and will have all the
additional extensions ready in
two weeks and then Barbourville
will have water that is pure and
there will be no question as to
one getting typhoid using water
in Barbourville. This would
have been done long ago had it
not been that it was necessary to
have a new franchise and the
company did not feel that it
should go to the additional ex
pense until a franchise and con
tract could be agreeed upon be
tween the city and company.
The last franchise is a much
better one than the first, as the
city council secured some reduc
tions that make it getter for the
consumers and at the same time
made it agreeable to the wishes
of the company.

The Civic Club met Oct. Uth,
at the home of Mrs. A. W. Hop
per with a large number in at
tendance. At the meeting it was decided
to sell Red Cross Seals for aid
ing the fight against tuberculosis.
Everyone should be ready to pur
chase some of these Seals when
the ladies call which will be at
Once.
After the business was dispos
ed of a delightful salid course,
also cake and ices were served.
Through the active efforts of
the Civic Club about seventy
heads of families have been sum
moned before the Court to ex
plain why they are not sending
their children to school. All of
these parties made excuses and
promised to send their children
if excused this time and they
were released upon the posetive
pledge that they would send
their children to school. If any
fail or refuse to do so the charge
is still aginst them and they will
again be brought into Court and
tried.
The officials are determined to
inforce this law and see that the
children of this county have an
education.

New Building Al
most Complete.
In the place where the old
wooden building stood on the
corner of River Street and the
Public Square, that was destroy
ed by fire some time ago, there
will soon be a modern two story
brick with a large store room be
low and office rooms above,
which is being erected by Mr. L.
C. Miller.
This is a historic old corner,
where John A. Black first went
into the dry goods business and
where Mr. L. C. Miller sold goods
for many years, amassing a large
fortune while there. It has been
occupied, since Mr. Miller left it,
by several other firms who have
done well. It will be for rent
when completed, as we are in
formed, and the man who gets
it will, noboubt, make no mistake
that we shall always hold in
highest esteem his manly quali
ties, his desire for justice be
tween litigants of all kind, for
fairness and impartiality between
all persons for whom he was to
be the arbiter in any contest.
We commend him most kindly
to those with whom he is soon to
be associated as worthy of their
esteem as a neighbor, an able,
discreet, and upright Judge, and
one who will bring honor and
respect to any people, community
or State who are so fortunate as
to have him with them.
