HUGHES HOLDS
MINNESOTA LEAD
St. Paul, Nov.. 13.-Additions, sub
tractions and corrections left no sub
stantial change in the relative stand
ing of Chatles E. Hughes and Presi
dent Wilson insofar as their Minne
sota vote is concerned. The revised
totals for the state gave Hughes 178,
819 and Wilson 17&,569, a Hughes plu
rality of 250.
That this lead at least will be main
twined in. the uncounted guardsmen
votes and those from the few scatter
ed districts not yet heard from, is the
opinion of leading Republicans.
Hughes Victory Imminent.
*8nless a revision of the entire state
vote discloses serious errors, Alinne
sota's electoral vote will be cast for
Roghes, his supporters believe.
Fairmount county soldiers voted 21
for Wilson and 11 for Hughes, accord
ing to returns received here. The
guardsmen are members of E com
pany, Second regiment.
Cass county's revised returns gave
Wilson 1,260 and Hughes 982. Fari
bault county soldiers favored Wilson
14 to 12. Soldiers from Goodhue
county, D and L companies, .gave
Eifghes 34, Wilson 35.
Quinn Vote Grows.
The Cass county returns show a
gain for Judge W. J. Quinn in the
aupreme court justice race. The total
'clte now stands Quinn 102,589 and
Anderson 95,902. This county's re
turns also show increased pluralities
foi Buruquist, Kellogg and Mills.
There are a few districts to. be
heard from, and virtually all of the
Second and Third regiments.
governor Burnquist's plurality is
growing steadily as the returns come
in. Indicating a probable lead of 130,
{O0 over T. P. Dwyer, his Democratic
opponent.
HOUSE FACES FIERCE
ORGANIZATION FIGHT
Washington, Nov. 13.-Members of
she House of Representatives in the
-newly elected Sixty-fifth congress face
ore of the most uncertain organiza
tic n situations in the history of the
kcvernment.
With a few districts still in doubt,
thr Republicans appear to have a plu
rality of four or five members and a
possible majority of two or three when
it is figured that an independent elect
ed in Massachusetts and a Progressive
eleeted In Minnesota probably will
vote with them for organization pur
poses.
The Republicans will have at least
217 votes, according to the latest re
ti:rns available. This is an increase
o: one in the total Republican mem
heyship previously reported, but is one
vote less than a working majority.
andependence of action has charac
tirized a number of the re-elected
ntembers on the Republican side, how -
ei Fr, and their attitude toward Demo
cratic legislation in the last few years
has given Democratic leaders cause
for hope that some or them might car
ry their independence into the organi
zation of the next house.

NoÂ« York, Nov. 13.-charles P.
r bhc- and William .t, Wilicox. chair
m of the Republican national cnmt
r ittee, plan to remain in New Yori
for a week or more to await the re
sult of the official count of the vote in
California, it was announced here.
Once the official count is finished they
expect to take a vacation, .11r. Will
cox said.
Count Will Begin Today.
San Francisco, Nov, 13.-The offi
cial count of California's vote in the
presidential election will begin today.
Steps have been taken not only to ex
pedite the enumeration but to insure
its accuracy. Both the Democratic
and Republican state central commit
tees have engaged checkers and attor
neys to scrutinize the count of each
tally sheet.
Two Guardsmen Killed.
Laredo, Tex., Nov. 13.-Corporal W.
J. Smith shot and killed Privates
Jones and McKnight and wounded
Private Conners while the four, all
members of K troop, Fourteenth ca'
S:-y, were answering stable call.
Walsh for Cabinet
A Billings dispatch dated Nov. 12,
says: Senator T. J. Walsh of Mon
tana, may be given a position in the
cabinet of President Wilson, after
March 4, next, as a consequence of his
exceptionally able management of the
western democratic headquarters in
Chicago, although the Helena man, in
passing through here today, declined to
comment on the subject. Senator
Walsh has been referred to also as the
possible successor of Senator Kerns as
floor leader, now that the Indiana man
has been defeated for re-election.
Sioux Falls Girl Killed.
Fresno, Cal., Nov. 13.-Miss Helen
Webster of Sioux Falls, S. D., a stu
dent at the Fresno normal school, was
killed near Clovis, eighteen miles from
Fresno, when the machine in which
she was riding went off the road and
down a forty-foot grade.
EXPERIMENTAL STATION
FOR MISSION VALLEY
A new agricultural substation,
seven miles southwest of Ronan in
the Flathead valley, close to the pro
jected line of the Northern Pacific
railway, is among the plans of the
Montana Experimental station for the
coming year. The legislature will be
asked to appropriate money for pur
pose of equipping and maintaining an
experimental farm, and in anticipation
of their favorable action, the state
authorities have set aside a suitable
tract of 280 acres of state land. The
land was set aside last year and has
lbeen cultivated this year in part, in
anticipation of its use next year. Prof
Alfred Atkinson of the agronomy de
partment has just been at Ronan to in
spect the work done this year and con
sider plans for the opening of the ex
perimental work next spring.
The reason for the request for the
new experimental substation is that
the problems of the Flathead are
rather different from those of other
parts of the state, and some special
experimental work in that region
seems quite justified. Chancellor E.
C. Elliott of the University of Montana
has approved the plan.
G. o. P. PLURALITY
IN NEXT CONGRESS
The probable complexion of the
Sixty-fifth congress was further
complicated by late returns from one
close district and a reclassification of
the politics of three members of the
California delegation. The count in
the one doubtful district, that in New
Mexico, is not yet complete, but the
election of Walton, democrat, is pro
lable, according to latest returns.
A reversal in the Tenth North Caro
lina district, where complete retnrnr
indicate the election of Congressman
J. Britt republican, by a plurality of
13 votes, broke the tie which existed
on the face of returns for congress
last night.
A reclassification of the politics of
three members of the elected Cali
fornia delegation, John J. Nolan in the
Fifth district; Everis A. Hayes in the
Eighth and Charles H. Randall in the
Ninth, in acordance with their politi
cal design iQ Congressional Record ap
parently was favorable to the republi
<an side.
The names of the three members ap
peared on the republican and demo
cratic tickets and Randall in addition
was also on the progressive ticket. In
the returns as previously announced
two had been credited as democrats
and one as republican. The Congres
sional Record, however, classes Nolan
as a progressive, Hayes as a republi
can and Randall as a prohibitionist.
As a result of these changes the re
publicans . from present indications
will have a small plurality in the
house, the latest figures giving them
216 members, the democrats 213 and
other parties six.
There are a number of close districts
where, on the face of complete returns
members are appasentuy elected by
very small pluralties. The Third
New Jersey district, where Robert
Carson, republican, is apparently elec
ted by 11 votes over Thomas J. Scully,
democrat and present member of con
gress, is a case. in point. The official
count next week may change some of
these close districts,
WILSON TICTORYK\
PLEASES LONDON
Feeling in England is favorable to
the re-election of President Wilson
and that feeling is expressed by the
news papers and public men. An
Associated Press dispatch from Lon
don says: The re-election of Presi
dent Wilson is welcomed by the
Weekly Nation as an event favorable
both for peace and to the cause of
state liberty and the paper thinks that
his election offers hopes of an early
end to t-e war agony than any nation
enduring it can yet foresee. William
Henry Massingham, the editor, in a
special note referring to President
Wilson says:
"The resources of the European
statesmanship are not so rich, nor
are its personalities so inspiring that
it can readily dispense with an acute,
powerful and in some degree pro
phetic intellect at the head of the
greatest power that the war has left
standing and the most sympathetic
to ourselves. I think that most men
and women here who take more than
casual interest in American politics,
read the news of Mr. 1Hughes' earlier
success with sinking hearts.'
The New Statesman regards it as
better for the entente allies to have to i
do with a president, whose mind they 1
know and who is unlikely to raise i
serious difficulties concerning the
British blockade.
"Moreover," it adds,( "Wilson is the
more likely to be interested personally
in the promotion of an anglo-Ameri
can entente, on the creation of which
after the war so many important
things will depend."
ALLIES GAIN IN
DOBRUDJA FIGHT
London, Nov. 13.-The Russians and
Roumanians on both the Dobrudja
and Transylvanian fronts of the Rou
manian theater are vigorously on the
offensive against the troops of the
Teutonic allies.
Keeping up their operations to the
north of the Constanza-Tehernavoda
railway begun last week, the Russo
Roumanian forces have been enabled
to push back Field Marshal von Mack
ensen's men to a front running
through the towns of 'Topal, Inancesne
and Karanasuf.
In the Transylvania zone the Rus
sians gradually have re-inforced the
Roumanians on the Northern section
of the line, until they now are fighting
side by side with them over a front
of about fifty miles south of the Buk
owina border.
The latest official communications
from both Bucharest and Petrograd
report the capture of Austro-German
positions in the Trotus and Alt Val
leys and the repulse of attacks at va
rious points. Near the Oituz pass the
Austro-Germans have made advances.
according to Berlin.
Saillisel is Captured.
After days of sanguinary fighting
the village of Saillisel, lying to the
east of the Peronne-Baupaume road in
the Somme region of France, has at
last fallen entirely into the hands of
the troops of General Foch.
In the capture of the town thy;
French inflicted heavy casualties on
the Germans and, in addition, cap
tured seven officers and 220 men and
eight machine guns. On the remain
der of the front in France artillery
duels are in progress.
Little fighting of moment is goinn
on in the Russian, Macedonian and
Austro-Italian theaters.
Along the Narayuvka river in Gall
clan attacks by the Russians ha' e
been put down by the Austro-Germans.
The town of Polog and Culse hill have
been captured by the Serbians from
the Bulgarians, according to Paris.
Berlin admits an advance by the Ser
bias in this region.
No infantry engagements on the
Austro-Italian front have been re
ported.

NEW MARRIAGE LAW
AT CLOSE OF WAR
A corespondent of the Associated
Press 'writing from Vienna,, says
Whether or not Emuope will be obliged
to change its marriage laws as. the re
sult of the war, is a qpestion which
has recently occupied: sociologists in
the central states. Most of them are
of the opinion that material modifi
cations must ensue; a few think that
legalized polygamy aseast be establish
ed in order to provide for the surplus
of women which two years of warfare
has made one of the problems of all
Europe.
The total population of the states at
war, the non-Arian elements of Rus
sia excepted, is; roughly 373,000,000,
of which, according to best sources,
188,000,000 are women and 185,000,000
men. For the countries of Europe
where exact statislics are available,
the proportion is 105 males to 107
females. For Europe this leaves in
normal times an excess of 3,000,000
females, of which number a third
would be marriageable.
To this milion of women who at
present can find no husband for the
reason that nature, while ensuring an
excess in the birth of males permits
more of them to die in infancy, will
be added at least 8,000,000 whom
death on the battlefield and incapaci
teating wounds has also deprived of
mates. Europe, therefore, is face to
face with the question of how these
9,000,000 women are to be cared for.
Economically the problem has be. ,n
solved by the women thenmeli es, by
showing that in many departments
of industry they are able to fill a
place. But sociologists point out that
except the state makes provisions
tending to avert this, a certain natural
law would increase the rate of illeg
.itimacy of. children, which even now is
* riolH matter.
At the conclusion of 'the 'Thirty
Years' war, similar conditions pre
vailed. It was met in many of the
central European states by making
polygamy legal. When the propor
tion of males and females had been
readjusted by the coming of later gen
erations these laws were repealed.
For the time being the European
parliaments are too occupied with
matters affecting the continuation of
the war, but expressions on the sub
ject agree that sonie sort of legisla
tion will be necessary.
Several writers point out that it
will take two generations before the
old social equilibrium is re-establish
ed. The tendency of men to marry
women younger then they themselves
are is held responsible for this.
Usually the men marries a woman
from three to five years his junior,
and some authorities fear that great
er choice, which the excess of women
will give, will decidely foster this in
clination, so that only the girl who
today is from 12 to 13 years od can
hope to be the subject of competition
among men, which her mother was.
This would be a matter of only
seven to eight years for most of
Europe; provided the end of the war
comes soon. Should the war con
tinue another year or two and so cause
the loss of many young men who are
ow from 15 to 16 years old the pro
blem would be much harder to meet.
In that case the excess of women over
men would be no less than 11,000,000,
so that for every male of marriage
able age, during the next ten years,
there would be almost two single
women.
It is impossible to say just how Eu
ropean legislatures will meet the sit
uation. Legal polygamy is so unwel
come to Europe's social system and
religion that opposition to it will be
great. The belief is neld, for this rea
son, that legally at least illegitimacy
will be abolished and that laws will be
passed giving the child born out of
wedlock every right upon the care and
property of its father. It is argued
that this measure of expediency would
meet the situation easily, and that it
would violate no social arrangement
now in force, giving in its most ex
treme application nothing but an ex
pression to a tendency which has
manifested itself in Europe for sev
(ral years past.

The attack occurred November 7.
The passenger train, convoyed by a

COLD BLINDS DRIVER;
NINE HURLED TO DEATH
Vancouver, B. C., Nov. 13.--Plunging
through the gates protecting a draw
opened to allow a tug to pass, a Van

George Smith, carried nine people to
death with the possibility that two
more may be added to the list.
Smith was driving to Vancouver at
high speed and the supposition is that
in the frosty air the windshield be

warning lights.
The heavy machine broke through

BANK CLERK TAKES $44,000
Young New Yorker Confesses Specu.
lations in Wall Street.
New York, Nov. 13.-James Miller.
a young clerk in the Liberty National
bank, confessed to President Thomas
Cochran and other officials of that
Institution that he had, within a per
iod of a few months, embezzled $44,
919.74 and had used the money in
speculation.
The lure of the "easy money" to be
made in Wall stredt led the young
man to speculate, he confessed. But
while others were winning hundreds
of thousands, he was losing.
According to a formal statement by
President Cochran, the liberty Na

Miller was honded in excess of the
amount taken.
