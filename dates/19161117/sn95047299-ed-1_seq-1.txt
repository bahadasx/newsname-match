The Second Regiment Band.
A recent issue of the Ocala Star
""It is conceded at Laredo, Texas,
that the band of the Second Florida
regiment is the best in tnai camp.
This is no news to those who visited
Black Point and heard the splendid
music rendered by this excellent or
ganization." In another item in the same col
umn, the Star says that "the Clear
water Sun is congratulating its town
on the fact that the city council has
made provision for weekly band con
certs The Star hopes the Ocala
council will be able to make provis
ion next year for weekly band con
certs during the summer."
A letter to the editor of The News
from Prof. J. W. Chattaway, director
of the Second Regiment band sta
tioned at Laredo, Texas, says: I
hope when we get home there will be
a nice band stand there as a surprise
for the bovs. Things are very quiet
here; the First and Second batalions
are now on outpost duty along the Rio
Grand. The boys are all well and
having a good time, but will be glad
to get home. And I, myself, hope
to soon be the and give our town
some more muse."
Palatkr.ns will reioice to know that
our band has made such a splendid
reputation. We always did feel more
or less pride in the band, but we were
also more or less, especially less,
,low about making ample provision
for the weekly band concerts. The
News trusts that when this fine band
returns to Talatka from the border,
tint the city will be a little more lib
eral in its appropriations for its main
tenance. First Baptist Church.

PROCLAMATION
BY THE MAYOR
To the Citizens of Palatka:
Palatka has been greatly honored by the farmers of the na
tion in being selected by the Farmers Educational and Cooperative
Union of America as the place of meeting for their national conven
tion beginning, Tuesday, November 21st. The delegates who will at
tend this convention represent more than three million farmers who
conduct cooperative enterprises doing an annual business of hundreds
of millions of dpllars.
Palatka is fortunate to have the leaders in the great progres
sive movement among the farmers of America as her guests. They
are the men and the women who are giving their best thought to solv
ing the problems of the farmer. Their presence among us is sure
to result in great good for the agricultura' interests of Florida, and
particularly for Putnam County and Central Florida. Cooperative
enterprises such as creameries, dairies, grain elevators, marketing
bureaus, farm schools and farm libraries are certain to follow in thi
near future to the substantial benefit of the great farming and live
stock section of which Palatka is the natural center because of the
advantages she gives to the farmer through exceptional rail and wa
ter transportation facilities for receiving his supplies and marketing
his products.
Our City Government, our business men and our progressive
farmers have responded liberally to defray the expenses for the en
tertainment of our visitors, but the spirit of hospitality for which
Palatka is famous, can best manifest itself by meeting our guests in
person, and by extending the little courtesies that make life so pleas
ant, assure them of the heartiness of our welcome.
I therefore proclaim Tuesday morning November 21st from
the hour of ten to 12 o'clock as a half holiday to permit all of our
citizens to take part in the welcome of our guests at the Grand. I
especially request that the school trustees arrange to have the school
chililien present as they will see and hear much that will be an in
spiration to them in their studies, and in the discharge of their duties
in the future as patriotic citizens.
W. P. MERRIAM,
Mayor, City of Palatka.

FENNELL OE GTANDIN
TO BE CHIEF DEPUTY
Under Sheriff Hagan-Others
to be Appointed on Peti
tion of People.
Sheriff-elect P. M. Hagan in an in
terview with The News this week
said:
"1 have decided to appoint Mr. I. J.
Fennell of Grandin my chief deputy
to reside in Palatka. There will be
no other deputy in this city. I am
going to be a working sheriff and will
be on the job at all times myself.
Mr. Fennell will be with me at the
court house.
"Other deputies in the various
towns and precincts will be appointed
only on petition of the citizens of
these towns or precincts; I mean a
majority of the citizens. Of course
where I believe a man is unfitted for
the work I shall exercise my pre
rogative of refusing the appointment.
I hope the people will use good
judgment in signing these petitions.
"There are a number of reforms I
intend to make in the conduct of the
sheriff's office. In the first place I
intend to enforce the law against
gambling. And by gambling I not
only mean games of chance among
the sporting element, but these punch
boards and other gambling devices
now being operated in violation of
law and which are ruining many of
our boys.
"These bootleggers and gamblers
and lewd negro women who go about
from camp to camp and manage to ar
rive on pay days they too, are go
ing to be put out of business in this
county. And the blind tigers all
over Putnam county may as well
take notice that they, too, will be re
garded as enemies of society whom I
propose to get."
Mr. I. J. Fennell of Grandin, who is
to be Mr. Hagan's chief deputy is a
son of the late James Fennell, one of
the best known men in the county in
his day and a democratic wheel
horse at a time when men were need
ed in the democratic party. He is
a gentleman of clean habits and one
who has native and acquired intelli
gence in abundance; a gentleman who
enjoys the respect of his neighbors.
NO WAR VESSELS TO
ENTERTAINJSITORS.
Efforts on the part of Senator D.
U. Fletcher to secure one of the ves
sels of the navy for Palatka during
the meetings of the National Farmers
Union here next week, have been un
availing, as will be seen from the
following letter, a copy of which Sen
ator Fletcher has furnished The
News:
Navy Department,
Washington Nov. 10th, 1916.
My Dear Senator:
Referring to our previous corre
spondence in reference to the assign
ment of Naval vessels to Palatka,
Florida, to participate in the Farmer's
Union National Convention during the
third week in November, I regret ex
ceedingly that there will be no Naval
vessels in the vicinity of Palatka
available for assignment at that time,
as the service of all vessels of the
Cruiser Force are urgently required
in Mexico and San Domingo.
Very sincerely yours,
(Signed) JOSEPHUS DANIELS.

to
Every day developes greater inter
est in the Colonists Fair of The Flor
ida Farms and Homes, Inc., at Orange
Springs November 24-25. . Col. Mur
phy is taking a deep personal interest
in the fair and is determined that it
shall rank with the best of the county
fairs in all essentials.
There has arrived in Palatka by the
Clyde Line boat a great tent 50x90
feet that will be the main exhibit hall
at the fair. This tent has been ship
ped to Orange Springs and will be
erected there on its arrival.
Palatka merchants are awakening
to the value of the opportunity that
the Orange Springs fair affords for
advertising their wares and several
of them have aranged for displays.
Among these are Messrs. C. E. Row-
ton, J. D. Points, Palatka Auto &
Supply Co., Mann & Hodge, Tilghman
Hardware Co., and others.
Ocala merchants also are taking a
great interest in the fair. The Or
ange Springs territory is a competi
tive field and Ocala and Palatka have
equal opportunity to get the trade of
the merchants and farmers along the
lino of the Ocalawaha Valley rail
road. For this reason it is important
that the business men of Palatka be
well represented at the fair.
Special low rates have been grant
ed by the railroad from Palatka and
intermediate points to Orange
Springs and return as follows:
Palatka, adults 50 cents and chil
dren under 12 years 25 cents; Stok
ley, 50 and 25c; Rodman, 40 and 25c;
Kenwood, 25 and 15 cents.
Mrs. E. E. Haskell of this city,
grand matron of the Order of Eas
tern Star in Florida, who attended
last week the general assembly of
grand chapters in Louisville, Ky., is
now making a round of official visits
to chapters of her jurisdetion in wes
tern Florida.
While in Pensacola cn Tuesday
Mrs. Haskell was quite surprised to
meet Judge Haskell, who was called
to that city on business. Judge
Haskell, who is a past grand master
of the Masonic Grand Lodge of Flor
ida, is , like his wife, prominent in
the Eastern Star. He is a past
grand patron of that order.
While at the San Carlos Hotel in
Pensacola, Mrs. Haskell was inter
viewed by a representative of the
Pensacola Journal. After the inter
view, this representative gives im
pressions of this charming Palatka
lady which The News is sure will find
a ready acquiesance on the part of
all her friends in this city. He says:
"Mrs. Haskell is not only a very
charming woman to look at but. a
most delightful woman to talk with.
Her alert mind and sympathetic un
derstanding admirably fit her for the
important ofhee she holds, and to
which she was elected at the annual
session of the grand chapter O. E. S.,
which met in Jacksonville last April.
"Mrs. Haskell has just returned
from the general assembly of grand
chapters which recently met in Louis
ville. The assembly convenes oncp
every three years, and Mrs. Haskell
spoke very proudly of the fact that
Sister Cora R. Franz, grand treasur
er of the grand chapter, and past
grand matron of Florida, was elected
at the general assembly in Louis
ville to the important office of Right
Worthy Grand Conductress of the
genpral grand chanter of the O. E. S.
"The membership of the Order in
Florida is about four thousand, with
ninety-six chapters. There are about
840,000 members in the United
States.
"Mrs. Haskell is not a native Flor
idian, but has lived in this state so
long she feels that Florida is her
home, and certainly thirty-one years
should give one the right to consider
any state one's own.
"It is the custom of the Worthy
Grand Matron to pay each chapter of
the organization an annual visit, and
Mrs. Haskell is now making a tour
of West Florida. She has already
visited Melborne, Greenville, Carra-
belle, River Junction. Blountstown,
Compass Lake, Bluff Springs, reach
ing Pensacola last night. She will
address the local chapter this even
ing at their chapter house in the
Masonic Temple.
"She will leave Pensacola Wednes
day morning for Lynn Haven, and
will lr.ter go to Cottondale, Green
wood and Quincy.
"On November 18, at Grand Ridge,
Fla., she will conduct a school of in
struction, which will be attended by
delegates from all over West Florida."
Thinks Catts All Right
Editor Palatka News:
I predict that our Hon. Sidney J.
Catts will make the people of Florida
a good governor. Not because I
supported him and you abused him,
but because he now sees and knows
that the people of our fair State have
bv an overwhelming majority endors
ed him. I believe that he will en
dorse every good and fair measure
that comes before the legislature.
Yours truly,
E. PINNER.

NEW DEPARTMENTS
ADDED TO FEARNSIDE'S
Goods for the two new departments
which have been added to the Fearn
side Clothing Company's big store are
nearly all in and on display, though
the display is nothing to compare with
what will be before Christmas.
These new departments are Boys
and Children's clothing, and Ladies
fine footwear.
Beautiful racks and show places for
these goods are to be made immedi
ately, along with a general remodel
ing of the big store, one change be
ing a steel ceiling with electrical
lighting apparatus.
The assortment of Boy's clothing
is magnificent. Nothing like it was
ever seen in Palatka. These goods
are now nearly all in and ready for
shoppers.
But the Ladies' Shoes. This de
partment is indeed something differ
ent. Only high grade shoes will be
handled. They will range in price
from $t to $15 a pair. But they are
heauties and of the finest makes.
The News representative was shown
a dozen varieties the other day and
he knows a pretty shoe when he sees
it whether in stock or on the foot.
Another thing never known in Palatka
before these shoes run from double
A widths to the wider varieties.
There is n full assortment of sizes.
Ladies with an A foot will no longer
be obliged to wear an E shoe.
Surelv this venture of The Fearn
"ide Clothing Company the "Big
Store": will meet with a hearty wel
come on the part of Palatka and Put
nam county ladies.
Clean Up For Convention.
His Honor Mayor W. P. Merriam,
a stickler for clean streets and well
trimmed and flower-bedecked lawns
and yards, issues the following to the
citizens of Palatka:
"In view of the approaching Na
tional Convention of the Farmers' Ed
ucational and Co-operative Union of
America, which undoubtedly will draw
the greatest number of visitors ever
attracted within the welcoming gates
of our fair city by a like event, it is
especially desirous that we make an
impression upon these strangers from
all parts of the compass the North,
the West, the East and the South
that will be most attractive, pleasing
and lasting. In no other way can
we better do this than by cleanli
ness. "The splendid work of keeping
clean our streets and yards and lawns
has always attracted attention and
caused favorable comment of tourist
and visitors, and this work is fully
endorsed and most heartily appreci
ated by the mayor and the Board of
Aldermen; and also by the Woman's
Club, that splendid organization to
which Palatkans are deeply indebted
for many beautiful civic improve
ments. "Therefore, I am asked to request
that special effort be made to inves
tigate conditions relative to the
streets, yards and lawns between now
and convention days, which really
will be all of next week, and that
where found all uncleanliness and un
sightliness be removed.
"It scarcely seems necessary to re
mind you of this, in view of your
past splendid efforts, but lest some
forget, I have been requested to call
your attention to the necessity of
your taking every precaution.
Very truly yours,
W. P. MERRIAM,'
Mayor.
