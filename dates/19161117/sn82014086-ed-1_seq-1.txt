SAYS RAILROAD STRIKE IS
A REMOTE POSSIBILITY.
George H. Sines, Vice President of the
Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen.
New York, Nov. 16. George H.
Bines, vice president of the Brother
hood ot Railroad Trainmen, in a state
ment made here today, said a railroad
strike la a remote possibility, no mat
ter what happens to the Adamson
eight hour law. The brotherhood lead
ers, he declared, have not even con
sidered calling a strike as an answer
to the Injunction proceedings by the
railroad.
"I don't think there Is anything In
the constitution of any of the brother
hoods allowing a strike during Injunc
tion proceedings,'' said Mr. Sines. "If
the supreme court decides the Adam
. son law ia unconstitutional, the broth
erhoods' will be right back where they
were before the law was passed.
"I doubt if the court decision would
revivify the strike vote taken by the
brotherhoods, in an probability, al
though I cannot say for a certainty
that it Is so, the unions would have to
take a new vote on a strike."

Backer was once rated as possessing
$25,000,000. Prospects were apparent

of $1,000,000, because of suits brought
successfully in federal courts in Flor

New London, Conn., Nov. 17. The
Deutschland, the German submarine
which arrived here on Nov. 1, slipped
out of the harbor at an early hour to
day, bound for Bremen. She left her
pocket at the state pier at 1.30 o'clock
and was towed down the harbor by
two tugs.
Launch With Newspaper Men.
Captain F. Hlnsch and other officials
of the Eastern Forwarding Company
were on one of the tugs. A launch
filled with newspaper men followed the
submersible down the Thames River
to the mouth of the harbor.
Saluted by Steamers.
The Deutschland passed the United
States cruiser in the lower harbor at
1:45 o'clock. Several steamers and
the Columbia turned their searchlights
on the boat and blew their whistles.
Cargo Valued at $2,000,00.
While the manifest of the Peutsch
land's cargo has not yet been made

at the entrance of the harbor. One
tug was leading the way and the orher
following at a close distance.
Lost Sight of by Shore Observers.
Shore observers lost sight of the
Deutschland half an hour later. It
was impossible to determine her exact
course. She had the choice of going
through Pushers Island sound, which
would eventually bring her off Block
Island, or she could sail through the
islands in the Race, where United
States forts are located. If she chose
the latter route she could pass be
tween Block Island and Monta.uk
Point.
Rumors of British Warship.
There have been rumors from time
to time of the presence of British war
ships outside the three-mile limit, but
these have not been verified. Captain
Koenier also said, soon after his ar
rival,, that the German war submarine
U-57 - would convoy the underwater
boat, back to Germany. There, has

off the coast.

the Deutschland would submerge at
ter she passed the three-mile limit.
. Unusual Activity.
Unusual activity fet the state pier
tonight indicated that the time was j
near at hand for the departure of the j
German submarine Deutschland. At 10
o'clock lights at the pier were dark
ened, there was signalling by means
of red lights, and a launch from the
North German Llo d liner Willehad
went down the harbor. To further ob
struct a possible view of the submer
sible in her pocket, large sheets of
canvas were placed over warehouse
windows- Guards kept would-be spec
tators moving.
It was believed these arrangements
were preliminary to turning the
Deutschland around at her pier. Ever
since her arrival here on Nov. 1 her
bow has pointed towird shore. During
the night.it was thought she would go
down the Thames a short distance and
back into trie pocket, so that she
would be pointed toward the sea.
It was reported that a shipment of
gold, expected by express from New
York, was the only thing now hinder
ing the voyage. The gold was said to
be valued at $990,000.

steel net that had guarded the en
trance to the pocket was pulled upon
the pier. A dozen r-ailors from the
Willehad joined the force of guards
and all persons were warned to keep
away from the wharf. A plank was
hurled at a newspaperman who ven
tured too close to the warehouses. A
hose was squirted upon other venture

ordered. The actions of the United
States cruiser Columbia, which an
chored off Eastern Point late today.

BEFORE THE AMERICAN ACADEMY
OF ARTS AND LETTERS
HITS CUBIST PATRIOTISM
Makea a Plea for Real Expression of
the American National Spirit in the
Writing and Art of This Country
Places Strength, Courage and Justice
Ahead of Grace Ease and Beauty.
New York, Nov. 16. The "Cubist
School in Patriotism," the "servflle
copying" of foreign masterpieces In
art and literature, the failure of Latin
literature to express the "soul of the
Latin race" and the ignobility of a
nation that is not "proudly willing and
able to fight for a just cause" were
a. few of the many subjects touched
upon by Theodore Roosevelt on "Na
tionalism in Literature and Art. The
keynote of the colonel's speech was a
plea for real expression of the Ameri
can national spirit in the writing and
art of this country, as he declared
that the "greatest literature, tne
greatest art must spring from the soul
of the people themselves.
Serious Art and Literature.
"It behooves us in the United
States." said he. "not to be content
with repeating on a larger scale the
history of commercial materialism of
the great Phoenician commonwealth
This means that here in America, if
we do not develop a serious art and
literature of our own. we shall have
a warped national life. Most certain'
ly I do not mean that art and litera-
ture are worth developing unless they
are built on a national life which Is
strong and great in other ways, un
less they are expression for that valor
of soul which must also come before
beauty.
Must Fight for Just Cause.
"If a nation is not proudly willing
and able to fight for a just cause, for
the lives of its own citizens, for the
honor of its flag, even for the rescue
of some oppressed foreign nationality,
then such a nation will also be an ig
noble nation, and this whether or not
it achieve the sordid prosperity of
those who are merely successful huck
sters or whether it kills its virility by
an exclusive appreciation of grace,
ease and beauty. Strength, courage
and justice must come first."

system preferred by the navy will be
installed in the battleships had not
been finally settled tonight. This as

leaving it to the government to pur
chase and supply the electrical drive

DOMESTIC ECONOMY BEING
PRACTICED IN MILWAUKEE
Less Vegetable Waste Received at the
Garbage Crematory.
Milwaukee, Wis., Nov. 16. The fact
that far less vegetable waste Is being
received at the Milwaukee municipal
garbage crematory now than at any
time since the plant was opened was
attributed today in a statement by C.
O. Davis, superintendent of the cre
matory, to the high price of food
stuffs. "The waste in the American kitchen
has been appalling and the present
situation shows what can be done
when economy is the first considera
tion," Mr. Davis said. "Judging from
thin potato peelings observed at the
crematory I suspect that the tubers
are being peeled with safety razors
these days."

ations was submitted today to the

will indicate the policy of the war de
partment regarding troops In Mexi
co. If It is the intention to keep them
there indefinitely the . requested Im
provements will be authorized, it was

fices and Factories.
New York, Nov. 16. Unnecessary
hiring and "firing" of employes causes
grea teconomic waste in stores, offices

met here today to consider the short--age
of help. They met as members
of the executive committee of the
welfare department of the National
Civic Federation. Louis A. Cooildge,

pecially since the munitions factories)
have been paying high wages and em
playing large forces, is becoming a
serious problem for employers con

$831,030.
