given up to the stringed Instrument

1 land from which many of our greatest
musicians come. He has, however,
spent the greater part of his life In
America. Ten years ago Mr. Cimera
played with Innes' Hand in concerts In
Orchestra Hall. Chicago. He has also
I played solos with Sousa's Band and
later with Bohumir ICryt's Band. For
three winter seasons hewas trombon
ist in the Kryl Concert Company. Last
I siimmer'he directed the Cimera Band
over the entire Redpath Chautauqua
five-day circuit.
The program for thr evening will be
