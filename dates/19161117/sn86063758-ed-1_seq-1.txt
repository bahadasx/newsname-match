Newberry, S. C., Nov. 14. 1916.
In pursuance of a call issued by
Jno. M. Kinard, a number of citizens
of Newberry county met in the courthouse
at 11 o'clock today to take steps
looking to the establishment of a
creamery,. !W. C. Brown was called
to the thair and W. H. Wallace was
made secretary of the meeting.. The
chair called upon Mr. Kinard to state
the object of the meeting. Mr. Kinard
stated that the object of the meet
ing was to take steps to estabiisn a
creamery, in Newberry county. He
^aid that at the recent state fair W.
Long, of Clemson college, told him
tfcat the government would establish
two more creameries in South Carolina
under government supervision,
and he desired that one of these
should be in Newberry, and that was
why he had called the meeting. Mr.
Kinard added that the sum of $4,000
would be necessary for the establishment
of a creamery?for the plant
Y itself and other expenses, lUblUUUtQ
the services of an expert for a year;
that 400 cows would "be necessary to
provided the cream for the plant, the
cream to be gathered from different
points somewhat as the mail is gathered
and distributed on the rural
routes, and in addition shipping points
alojig the railroads could use that'
means of conveyance. The expense of
.getting the cream to the creamery
will be met by the owners of the cows;
but that expense can be made very
light by combinations of shippers.
Mr Long assured Mr. Klnard that a
-creamery would pay the stockholders
nor ppnt Drofit: that no stock
holder would be permitted to receive
more than eight per cent, whatever
-surplus made over that figure would
go to the owners of the cows for the
-cream furnished. The enterprise,
while based on business principles,
is not intended so much as a bo?tness
enterprise in the usual sense, but more
for the purpose of developing the country
along the lines of diversification,
cooperation and marketing.
A number of persons spoke on the
subject of a creamery. It was shown
~that, accord
during me
ing to Mr. Long, the industry had
proved a great success wherever it
is being tried. T. M. Mills, county;
-demonstration agent, read a letter
from Mr. Patrick of Clemson college,
an expert, in which he said that farmers
make from $5 to $10 a month per ,
cow by sending thf milk to the cream- f
ery; that it is being done now in a
great many instances. providing
farmers in this way with ready cash |
to help them start their farming op- j
erations on a cash basis, for thp checks
are sent out monthlv. Mr. Mills said
3i creamery ought to have six hun- j
dred contributing cows, but that four (
hundred would be sufficient to start
Su . than that number would
Willi?IWo V
not do. He felt sure that milk would j
be shipped from several noints along
the railroad, for instance Chappells,
and Chapin. taking in adjacent por-}
tions of Saluda and Lexington coun- {
ties. Spartanburg has a creamery,
that is making S.000 pounds of butter j
p month. There is a creamery at j
tp<vrs<>n rolle^e that is making 12,-j
000 pounds of butter a month, andj
the men m^keting it sav they oouM i
di>ro^e of five timps as much if they 1

and replied $65; his is a large one, 1
candling five hundred pou-nds an koux\
Smailer separators could -be bought
for $14 or $15?even cheaper than
*- ?
^at by cooperation.
Senator Johnstone, president of the
board of trustees of Clemson college,
spoke of the creamery at Clemson and
of his reci-nt trip with tlie South
Carolina commission to Alabama.
Louisiana, Mississippi and otner
weevil infested districts, and urged
preparation for the coming of the
weevil in this section which he thought
would be within a year. Mr. Johnstone
declared that there is no feature
of competition or rivalry in the
"LJ n aaiA tho f?T*st
Cr6311itJi y uuoi|^coo? ouiu m* payroll
made up of farmers contributing
cream to the Clemson creamery
was $100; now the creamery is sending
cheeks aggregating $1,200 every
month to farmers for cream. The
butter made at the creamery brought
a good price, because it is made the
best way, and every farmer contributing
cream gets the same >rice.
"There is no competition or rivalry
among them, but cooperation." Mr.
Johnstone said that the scientific
' "? J?~~~~j fVia octohliflh

of a creamery has been extended
to other farm products, such as
eggs and pounltry.
In the course of his talk Mr. Johnstone
told of Several incidents in his
trip to the West. The commission,
he said, visited the small farms and
the large ones, and got all (he information
they could regarding the boll
weevil. At Mound, Mississippi, they
found a large planter who gave them

ing of the weevil found him In a con-1
dition of unbelief; he did not believe)
so insignificant a thing as this littlo
insect could keep him from making
cotton; he had made lots of cotton
and got rich at it. He Tiad $600,000,
and lost $500,000 of it by the boll
weevil. Then he began to diversify;
to consult experts and follow the
teachings of agricultural colleges;
planted large fields of potatoes and
other things; established a cannery

year, he says, he will come out even, j
and next year expects to make money I
? more perhaps than he ever made
with cotton.
Mr. Johnstone was very earnest in
urging diversification and in expressing
the fact that the boll weevil is
coming, and coming soon. He pledged
himself to do whatever he was able
to do to establish and help a cream

Mr. Kinard said, "We must have the j
sinews of war! we must have $4,0001
?not $3,000?not a cent less than
$4,000;' and he felt sure it could be
obtained. He then moved that the
chair appoint a committee of two
from the city and two from each township
to make a canvass in their several
townships and raise the four
thousand dollars in stock for establishing
the creamery. The motion was
adopted, and the chair appointed the

the supper. Now, if that meant that
there was no room near by to which
the members went to refresh themselves,
it is well. But somehow I
never could believe much in this
thing of doing things in an indirect
way. Don t pretend to be what you
are not, has always been my rule.
I have reached the conclusion that
it does not always pay, as the world
goes, but I believe it is right, and I

way, and that it will surely come out
right at some time or other. I mention
this not to criticise, but simply
to say that I have been thfhking some
little of late on some things and I
have about reached the conclusion it
would be well for this country if there
never was again a .gill of intoxicating
liquors manufactured. I doubt if it.
ever did anybody any good, ^jid yet
the farce of the thing as we have it
is not, to say the least, very encouraging.
If we are going to have prohibition
let us have it straight. I read
in some paper the other day where
the shipment of whiskey from Jack
OA AAA rvn O'OC
sonvme itUUUL OU,UUU
gallons, a day. Think of that much
whiskey being shipped every day from
one little town like Jacksonville, and
all of it going into prohibition communities.
And then just go around
to any express office and see the
Jnrge number of packages that are
coming in all the time. I believe in
beer and light wines as the solution
of this whiskey question. I believe
that if Mr. Manning had signed that
bill that the last legislature passed
allowing something like 60 pints ot
beer a month, or only two quarts of
whiskey, it would have been a long
step in the direction of prohibition.
They tell me that the kind of whiskey;
they get now is?well, it is not the
forest. Brt then I don't know much
a^out the whiskey proposition and I j
reckon I better tMk about something
else.
I
It is a certain fact that the people
are going to have some sort of bev- i
erage. If you don't believe It you
just stand around and watch these j
scft drink fountains and see how
much coca cola is being used, and
somehow I never did believe that it
was the most neaitniui inmg iu
but you sure can get the habit
just like you can get the whiskey
habit or any other habit. In fact, the |
human animal is very much a bundle
of habits any way. And it seems to,
be much easier, or rather the animal j
is prone to form those habits that J
the people say are not beneficial. 11
reckon it is because we are all more
or less going in the wrong direction.
While there is bo much regulation
and the removal of germs and

have wondered why they did lot get
up some plan that would ca people
to form good habits and i?e good
by nature and just natural like. But
we get mad and we want to fight and
take advantage of one another, auu
it all comes from the formacion of
bad habits.
Tliis reminds me of a statement b>
Smithy, Buster Brown's partner. He
is a great character, but somehow he
always shows up the diamond in the
" * ~ Vim 11 T\
rougn. .tni?5ier umu tu uww uim ut>
with a keg of powder the other day,
and he turned around and kept Buster
from burning up from the explosion
of the powder. But the statement
I have reference to is on forgiveness.
And the turning of the other cheek
when you are smote on the one
cheek. It runs like this: -s.
"My ma says she believes in forgiveness
and mercy all right but she
thinks if some one smites you on the
right cheek you should turn the other
cheek and then kick the very stuffing
out oi mm?itiiu u-ieu uiwi
She thinks there's too many people!
who just do wrong because they know I
they can be forgave. And she believes
it's good for us if we forgive them,
but it's bad for them. Ma thinks it's
good to forgive the prodigal son but
not. to feed him. Get him a job on the
stone pile. Ma forgave me but she
soaked me first.''
This is human nature and expresses
it very forcibly. That is the way
most people turn the other cheek.

little hit abruptly, and yet it is in
a sense germane to what I have been
