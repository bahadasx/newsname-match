Short Course Here
Next Month
County Agriculturist John M
Davis has written to H. A
Maltby to inform him that a
Farmers' Short Course will be
held in Cut Bank on Dec. 14. 15
and 16. Mr. Davis expresses
the hope that the farmers of
this section of the county may
take keen interest in this meet
ing. It will b e a t a season
when it will be possible for ev
ery farmer to attend. The short,
course idea has become a popu
lar one in all the leading agri
cultural regions and it is to be
hoped that Cut Bank's first
gathering will prove successful.
Vital problems for the Mon
tana farmer, such as marketing,
grain grading and the many
other questions pertaining to
the permanent welfare of the
producers will undoubtedly be
discussed. The Pioneer Press
hopes to be in position to give
more details concerning the pro
gram in a later issue,
Walt's Philosophy
on Getting Old
I realize, with bitter grief, I'm
in the sere and yellow leaf. The
thing that once excited me. and
made me throw two fits or three,
no longer makes the o.d appeal
and quite indifferent I feel.
When presidential fights were
on, in happy times forever gone,
for days together I saw red; I
hardly ever went t o bed. I
really thought if A should win,
a golden era would begin; I real
ly thought if A should lose, we'd
have to suak our shirts and
shoes to buy our hungry chil
dren bread, and life would be a
thing of dread. But now I hear
the statesman roar the same
old thunder as of yore, and not
a tremor do I feel and not a
warning makes appeal. I know
that when the fuss is done, and
A has lost and B has won, we'll
all plod on in the same old way,
and saw our wood and bale our
hay, and love and laugh, and
sing and sigh, and woo and wed
and workand die.—Walt Mason.

California Decides
The Issue
Ten days since the national
election and no polite notes of
congratulation have passed be
tween Charles and Woodrow.
It all centered on California
and Wilson is quite safely in
the lead in that state, unless ir
regularities on a large scale are
found. The official count is
now being conducted in that
state and to date no important
changes are resulting.
In Minnesota it was nip and
tuck tor days, with Wilson
leading one day and Hughes
the next. But Minnesota now
appears to have landed safely
in the Hughes column.
In Montana Miss Rankin has
won for Congress and several
republican state officials nosed
their democratic rivals out of
the race in later returns. The
prohibition amendment carried
by several thousand.

HARD TO PLEASE EVERYBODY
Constant Round of Gaiety Got on
Nerves of Convict Who Wanted to
Meditate Over His Sins.
"We are now approaching our state
penitentiary, where the honor system
Is In force. Those men in dark blue
suits who are playing golf are con
victs."
"Prison life isn't hard for them, 1
dare say."
"Oh, no. I also hear cheering and pre
sume a baseball game is going od
somewhere in the vicinity. Every eve
ning there is a moving picture show tc
entertain the prisoners."
"I don't suppose any complaints are
ever heard?"
"'Not many. However, an honor man
walked away only last week."
"Surprising!"
"He left a note to the warden, say
ing he had to go to a place where he
could meditate over his sins, as the
constant round of gaiety in prison was
getting on his nerves."—Birmingham

The Pioneer Press now has the best printing plant in
Northern Montana.
Ninety five persons in every one hundred in this sec
tion read the Pioneer Press.
Everybody has cash and everybody is trying to com
bat the high cost of living.
The point is this—
The alert merchant will want to keep the cash of the
people at home. He will be ambitious to reach outside
of this town's logical territory for trade at this season.
That's what makes a big town out of a small town.
And there's only one way to accomplish this—by buying
space in the Pioneer Press,the Big Paper of North Teton.
Present Close Contest on President
is Likened to Memorable Tilden
Hayes Contest that Stirred Nation
Washington, Nov. 9. —The
Tilden-Hayes election contro
versy of 1876 was reviewed to
day by persons who fear a dead
lock in the contest between
Hughes and Wilson.
In the election of 1876, Sam
uel J. Tilden (dem.) carried
Connecticut, New York, New
Jersey, Delaware. Maryland,In
diana and Missouri, as well as
ten southern states, whose
votes were not in dispute; 184
electoral votes were obtained
for him and 185 constituted a
majority. One additional elec
toral vote would have brought
him into the presidency, and it
seemed possible that one could
be had from Oregon, where
three republican electors had
undoubtedly been chosen, but
one was considered ineligible
under the law and the demo
cratic governor had appointed
in his stead the next candidate
on the poll, a democrat, and
given him his certificate.
I n t h e south, 19 electoral
votes were in dispute. In Lou
isiana, a republican board had
given ceitificates to the repub
lican electors. In Florida, the
vote had been close. In South
Carolina federal troops had
guarded the polls. There were
double returns from Florida,
Louisiana and South Carolina.
One vote out of the 200 dis
puted—the one from Oregon
would have given the presi
dency to the democrats. The
control of the government de
pended upon the action of con
gress when it met in joint sts
sion to count the votes. The
house was democratic, the sen
ate republican. Congress lis
tened willingly to proposals of
compromise and it was agreed
that an electoral commission
should be constituted consisting
of five members of the house,
three democrats and two repub
licans; five members of the sen
ate, three republicans and two
democrats, two democrats and
two republicans from the su
preme bench o f t h e United
States and an additional justice
from the same court, selected
by the four justices named.
Rutherford B. Hayes was
chosen and Tilden turned down.
In his story of this contro
versy in his "History of the
American People." Woodrow
Wilson said:
"Such a commission was un
doubtedly an extra constitu
tional body and its decisions
disappointed the country of any
display of judicial partiality it
may have hoped of from it.
Mr. Justice Bradley, who was
chosen by his fellow justices of
the commission to be the 15th
member of the tribunal, voted
in every instance in favor of
the republican claim, as did ev
ery other member of the com
mission, whether judge, senator
or representative, whose affilia
tions were with the republican
party. Every democrat on the
commission voted in favor of
the democratic claim."
The High School Athletic

Effort Is Made To
Relieve Shortage
Railroads Rushing Coal to
Places Worst Hit
By Famine
Energetic efforts are being
made by the Great Northern to
relieve the coal situation up
north, according to a telegram
the Montana commission has
received from Superintendent
F. D, Kelsey. Coal shipments
have been given preference over
all other classes of freight. The
following wire was received
from him:
"Nineteen cars of commercial
coal at Belt being moved this
morning. Delay was d u e to
bad condition o f t h e round
house when the cold snap came
on. Putting in new turntables
and new cinder pit and am
caught up with all engines out
side addition. This Leigh coal,
which is washed, froze up solid
in coal chute and in cars. Get
ting things going good this
morning. Moving coal to all
points in preference t o other
freight; also loading about 35
cars of coal in the Sand Coulee
district to divide even between
Glasgow, Dobson, Malta and
Havre, where the most serious
shortage is."
Piatt Murder Case
On Trial
Choteau, Nov. 15.—The Nov
ember term of the district court
was opened here at 10 o'clock to
day, with Judge Leslie presiding.
A great influx of jurors have
crowded ev^ry hotel and rooming
house, and at present rooms are at
a premium.
The most important case for
trial is the Piatt murder case,
which is being given first place.
All day was used up in trying to
get a jury, and it is expected most
of tomorrow will be required to
get twelve men satisfactory to
both sides. In all probability the
rest of the week will be used up
with this murder case. Mr. Piatt
is a quiet rancher living 15 miles
from Choteau near what is called Lit
tle London school house. Last
winter he was given a contract to
build a school house at Bole, and
before the building was finished he
got iii a quarrel with AJr. Bundy, a
member of the board of trustees,
and as a result Mr. ßundy was shot
to death. Two of Mr. Bundy's
brothers are here to act as witnesses
in the trial.
A girl was born to Mr. and
Mrs. George Cleland Tuesday,
