The State Uepartmcnt has recog
nir.'d that submarines are many times
mo**e effective when ihd illegally than
whin they attempt to obey the rules
of ciuiser warfare. Whll... thev can
fii'ark without warning with safety to
themselves and with almost certain
j rospects of suceess. they are exposed
to tltack if they appear on the surfaci
to hail their prey, and they risk los
ing it through escape by flight.
Prttideat U Ison and Secretary Lan
sir.g have discussed the new submarine
menace that is believed to be devel
rping, but what steps they have taken
or will take to avert it have not been
divulged. Many advisers of the Pres?
ident believe he can dissuade (iermany
only by instituting peace negotiations,
a, ?? :~ h.'l.eved a hope of early peace
through American pressure on the Al?
lies would be even more attractive to
(iermany than a successful submarine
rainpwgn against Hntain.
U-Boat Captain Denies
Shelling "Rowanmore Boat
Berlin, N'ov. |g, Assertions that th>:
German submarine which sank the Brit?
ish ehip Rowanmore. on which wero
.several Americans, fired upon the life
boat> me dismissed as utterly false in
the report of the commander of the
submarine, further details of which b<s
came known to-day. In fact, it is said
the men on the Rowanmore owe their
lives to the precautions taken by tho
(iermans and the skill with which their
operations were carried out.
During the twenty-minute pursuit o'
the steamship the submarine's shots
were aimed aecurately astern to limif
the danger to the crew, which was con
gregated at the bow, it is declared. Tho
Rowanmore was hit ten times, the last
- heII disabling the propeller.
The submarine ceased tiririg, the re?
port .ontinues. as soon as it was ob
MfTfld that the Rowanmore had de
erttlfld her speed aml abandoned the
effort to escape. No shots were fired
at the men in the boats. Just before
she stopped the Rowanmore hoisted a
signal, but it was impossible to read it
from the submarine. at that time about
i-'.OOO yards away. Later it was shown
that the signal was "1 surrender"
The master of thi Rowanmore at
ttmpted to justify his attempt to es?
cape, the submarine commander re?
ports, by the assertion that he desired
to gain time to launch boats. but this
pretext was not accepted. I^ter the
Rowanmore's captain was made a pris
oner of war for attempting to escape
and for -ummoning ass.stance by wire
ii as, whirh speed.ly brought up a Brit
i-h dtttrtptC fhtltapta the Rowan?
more was sunk hy a torpedo.
The live. AgeatJ points
out that the cargo tf the Rowanmore

l.oiiu tons of oil. to?
gether with BCidl, .-\plo?ives and
tad in addition '.i.tXhi tons of wheat,
the whole valued Bt approximately 13.
The ihif was sunk by thfl
submarine after an examination of her

Withdrawal of 6.000 Men
from Border Causes
Surprise

Washington, Nov. 1?;. Five regimenta
of militia, totalhng about ti.OOO men,
were ordered home from the Mexican
border to-day. They are the 7th New
Vork, the lat South Carolina, the _d
Indiana, the _d Wisconsin and the M
Minneiota. All aro infantry.
The order came as a aurpriie, be?
cause Secretary Baker announeed a
month ago thal regiments would go
home only as others were sent to re
place them. The "reserves" for relief
duty were exhausted some time ago.
To-day, however, it was annotinced
that the new order was "in pursuance
of a policy already announeed to with?
draw the militia gradually in accord
BBCe with the rccommendations of Gen?
eral Fnnston."
Whether to-day's movement will be
followed by further withdrawal. was
not indicated. but the understanding is
that all the militia will go home as soon
as the Mexican commi-sion agrces to
the withdrawal of Pershing's expedition
from Mexico. It was predicted to-day
that such ar. agreement would bo
reached within ten days.
Approximately 100,000 National i
Guardsmen will remain on the border
wlun these five rugiments have been
withdrawn. The regiments will start
home as soon as transportation facili
ties will permit, and all probably will
be at their state muster points by
Thanksgiving Day.
San Antonio, Tex., Nov lti. The tive
infantry regiments ordered home from
the border to-day by the War Depart?
ment were selected by Ceneral Funstoa
from the troopa on patrol duty at the
re4*uest of the department to designate
that number of organizations for re
lease.
It was admitted in military circles
that there are no state troops to take
the place of those relieved unless regi?
ments that have already seen border
-ervice are sent back. All troopa re
maining in state mobili.ation camps
wire exhausted under the last call,
when 2..000 Guardsmen were sent to'
telieve some of the organizations that
had been on the border for a period of
months.

ports of the success of anti-government
faction* ir, various seetions of Mexico
to-day tended to divert the Mexican
American commission from further con

recent ly reached by the conferrees. The
Americans were adviaad of a Constitu

the line of the Mexican National Bail
iiny ^lightly more than one hundred
mil-s from the L'nited States border.
The Mexicans were without advice con
t.rntng this reported action.
The commission has completed a
arritteB draft of the verbal agreement
tecently reached. Besides providing
for the withdrawal of Pershing's col-;
uir.r.. the understanding ia authonta
tively declai'd to be that the de facto
government will dispatch a numerically

Until the ridg? to the east had

would subject the Allied .rjMM to
an enfilading fire t'rom the heights

the village of Jaratok, on the eilge of

Drive Along the Plain
Thus the menace from the ea?' was
removed. Taking immediate advantage
of this, the French and Russiaas. aided
by Serbian detachments, moved up tha
plain. They advanced on both sniei
of the Monastir-Flonna railway
The column operating to the east of
the railway is now in poiition to jor,
forces with the Serbs advancing from
the east. The western column pro '
gressed as far as the Vira Kiver. four
miles south of Monastir, clearing tha
mountain positions on their left.
In this way Monastir is threatened
by a double track from the east and
the south.
With the new interest in the Mace?
donian campaign, ther. ia fresh specu?
lation as to when Sarrail will launch
his drive up the Vardar and Struma'
valleys. The Britiah to-day gave a hint
of larger activity when they captured
the villaire of Karaslaska, On the east

It is noteworthy that since (ieneral

increased activity on the Macedonian
