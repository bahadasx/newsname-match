HIGH QUINT TO GET BUST MON
DAY—FAST TEAM ASSURED
—NEW SUITS
Next Monday Petrus Liljedahl,
athletic coach at the high scnool, will
get the boys out for basketball jirac
tice. Football season is now over
and a meeting will be held tomorrow
to talk over the year's work and- to
elect a captain for the ensuing year,*
whereupon the team will disband.
Prospects are good for a winning
basketball team this year, Mr. Lilje
dahl says. Three of the regulars
and two of the regular subs from last
year's team will be back and Lloyd
Tanner, who was the star performer
for Bemidji high last year, is with
Little Falls this year. There is also
some very likely material among the
other boys. Five teams will bo out
for practice from the start.
It is not likely that any games will
be played with ontside teams until
after the holidays, as it would inter
fere with other entertainments that
are planned for the near futnre.
The team will get new suits thifl
year. The jerseys will probably be
orange with a blue stripe.
Among the likely candidates for
the team are Captain Levin, Dob
byn, Lloyd Tanner, Sims, Grimes,
Holmes, N. Elvig, Tonrtillott, Hinck
le, Bastien, Charles Fortier and sev
eral others.
