Governments. Announcement that

known tho other Mexicans wero In
telephonic communication with him
to-day. It Is not holloved, howovor,
that tho unexpected dovelopmont late
to-day was duo to his counsel.
Cabrera Opposed to Plan.
Mr, Cabrera, It now is known, has
been opposed, apparently unalterably,
to tho plan as It has been discuss

llevo that he has suggested a. counter
plan., but that his associates choso to

Mr. Bonlllass denied to-night that
Mr. Cabrera had lntorferrod with tho
adoption of any plan and sought to

Mexican delegates.
Minor points aro yet to ho consluV

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO1

ING ADAMSOX LAW.
APPEAL TO PRERIDENT
Brotherhoods Will Ask Chief ExCcp
utivo to Give Them Promised
8-Hour Day 'Jan. 1.
Washington, Nov. 15. Attorney
General Gregory has decided that
suits by railroads against enforce
ment of the Adamson eight-hour law
will bo defended by tho Department
of Justice.
Tho defense to be presented In tacb,
uaso will be worked out between SV
licitor General Davis and other de
partment officials with United State
Attorneys in various Jurisdictions'.
The department today was unaBIe
to determine whether it would Bo
content to mako a test case of one
suit. No word has reached the" At
tornoy General from the railroad
suggesting such a course, and if sues,
a proposal is not made each suit will
be defended. (
Reports that railroads and broth'
erhood officials had considered a sug
gestion that Mr. Gregory bo asked
to suspend operation of the Adameon
law for thirty days were met with
the. statement that the Attornoy Gen
eral lias' no such authority, aud that
his only course is to defend tho
suits or let them go by default. ,
Two developments stood out prom
inently to-day In the situation ails-'
lng from tho forthcoming application
of the law: v
First The anouncement that tno
managers of the rouds would- prob
ably apply for Injunctions against the
law in every Federal Court district
in tho United States, with a separate
suit In behair of every one- of the
200 railroads in every district which
they enter, making approximately"
about 5,000 suits. Should this step
be taken and tho litigation involved
run tho ordinary course of legal pro
cedure, tho eight-hour law will Be
from six months, to two years be-
hlud tlmo lu going Into effect, even
If found constitutional, It 'was de
clared. Second The brotherhoods of
trainmen announced that thoy will
make an appeal to President Wllsoa
to give them on January 1 next tho
eight-hour day, which they say was
promised them at Washington last
summer when tho strike order was
recalled.
The brotherhoods, it was announc
ed, will not contest tho suits to bo
Instituted by tho roads and will noC
appear by counsel In court to arguo
for the constitutionality of tho eight
hour law. They contend that that
duty logically devolves upon tho At
torney General, aud will look to tho
Judicial branch of tho government to
fight their battlo.
Prior to his departure for his homc
in Cleveland, Warren S. Stone, chief
ot tho Brotherhood of Locomotivo
Engineers, declared that should tho
law bo stricken from tho books on
tho ground ot unconstitutionality
tho brotherhoods would depend on
President Wilson to havo framed an
other net which will withstand the
attacks of hostile couusel.
