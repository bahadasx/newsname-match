seemed to be popular with the

At the end of the tenth round
the boxers signed articles for

bouts.
Both boys had plenty of time

Jack Thomas jumped into the

The pink boll worm is a com

spreading from India to Egypt
about 8 years ago. It has al
ready spread to practically all
cotton-producing countries in the
world except the United States.
Recognizing the possibility of
ntrouueing the pest into this
country in cotton seed, seed cot
ton, and cottonseed hulls, the
United States has prohibited for
several years the importation of
these products from all cotton
producing territory except 0
States of northern Mexico. For
the same reason cotton lint from
inch countrii a h is been admit

at certain northern ports and
after fumigation. The new
amendments to quarantine reg

'xtond the prohibition against
'inporting seeds, seed cotton, and
hulls to the previously excepted
Mexican territory, with the ex
ception of the Imperial Valley
south of the Mexico-California
line. This area is continuous
with the Imperial Valley of Cal
ifornia, is devoted to the culture
of the same kind of cotton, and
ii largely settled by Americano
In view of the unity of cotton

however, involving the five
states of Nuevo Leon. Coahuila.

'nuHpas, the discovery of the pink
, boll worm in the Laguna district
makes it absolutely imperative
that furthur movement of cotton
seed and hulls be stopped. This
has been effected by the order
issued by the Secretary of Agri

Miture, revoking the amond
. itnts to tho cotton seed quaran-
.ne wh.eli permitted such mo.vo
u.ent of seed from these States.
i he control of the movement of
jmt cotton fr.om these States of
hoi them Mexico has been euoc
td by a revision of quarantine
Angulations which will necessi
tate the transportion by water
route of Mexican cotton inten
ded 'or the United Statos to
ape. ..v- north' ni ports of ontry
where ciisinfi ition and compli
ance with the other features of
the regulation can be l.iade.
The establishment of the pink
iioll worm in Mexico presents
ne of the greatest menaces
which has come to Amorican
cotton culture in its history.
This insect in India, Egypt.
iiawai:, and other loreign cotton
producing countries, has shown
a capacity for damage exceeding
that of tho boll weevil. This
possibility of damage has war
ranted tho Department of Agri
ulture, under authority of the
Plant Quarantine Act, to make
he most strenuous efforts to
elude this insect from the
United States. This has invol
ved, as already nuted, the regu
lation of the entire cotton im
porting business, representing
i value of imports of from thirty
to fifty million dollars annually,
nd tho control of the utilization
if foreign cottons in all of our
spinning, weaving and waste
mills, and other factories utiliz
ng such cottons in any raw
state.
The Laguna district, where
'.he insect has been discovered,
epresents one of the most im
lortant cotton producing area?
n Mexico. It is an elevated
lateav region near San Pedro
n central northern Mexico
"otton culture is there more in
tensively prosecuted than any
where else in Mexico, and it is
wssible that this very interest
n cotton Vulture has led to the
ntroduction of the pink boll
vorm in the effort to get impro
ed cotton varieties from Egvpf
v other foi-'ign sources. The.
M-wuei-.' that the worm exist?
n Me.drj H.rdU'd from the sen
ding by a planter of the Lagunr
ustrict to the Federal Hor
ticultural Board for deter- j
mination some cotton bolls j
rrom his plantation which he
supposed to be infested with
the common boll weevil. An
examination of this material
mowed that the infesting inset"
s the dreaded pink boll worm o1'
"Sgvpt and India.
The pink boll worm hibernates
in the larval state in the seed,
ind in this way is readily carried
'o any quarter of the world by
seed exportation. The adult in
icct is a small moth. The worm
ittacks the immature cotton
bolls, anil, in severe cases, re
duces the yield 50 per cent. In
addition to this, the amount of
oil obtained from the seed of in
fested cotton is lessened from
15 to 20 per cent.
In announcing the discovery
of the pink boll worm near
American cotton-producing are
as, tho Department of Agricul
ture urges that all cotton inter
ests give assistance to the Fed
eral authorities in preventing
any movement in violation of
the new amendments of cotton
seed, cottonseed hulls, seed cot
ton or cotton lint from Mexico
into the United States.
