RICE ASSOCIATION
INRWEcS MUi IMUM
I The Board of Directors of the
Southern Rice Cr owers' ass,.ciation
has again advanced :i:e mrnnnm be
- low which [as ,oci1m1 .' :Ai1 i'll rot be
- so l. T'his is the s.'c.c d tme since
the season opened tthat th h:o'rdl has
taken action of this kii1,l. The first
e minimums fixed were $3.50 for lion.
Y duras No. 1, and $3.25 for Bl,e Rose
No. 1. These were advanced to $3.G1
and $3.35 respectivel i: OctoLer. Trhe
s following minniums ~vc:'ui xd ,:i during
- the November meeting of the directors
and are now in effect:
: e 'e F'ancy
'No. 1 -.-.--8.. $
1 No. 2 --------- 3.40 3.60
e No. 3 . . 5 3.4U
- No. 4 $,.,) 3.20
The advances refie, cd in the fore
Sgoing are warranted by existing mar
ket conditions. In October 1.204,915
pockets of clean rice were distributed
by the mills, which was the largest
distribution ever recorded for that
month. The mo.eraent of :o.h rough
and clean rice has !ben freer this year
- than at any time in tie ;,ast. Lhuriin
t,.e 'hree mont.; e :i ' N:oven,!,cr 1st
there was re.L . '1 y nuli 286,455
bags of rough rice as compared with
'2,124,440 sacks during the correspond
ing months of 1915. For the same
s period the distribution of clean rice
amounted to 2,493,512 pockets as comr
pared with 1,357,1:;; pockets for the
'orresponding period in 1915. July,
August and Septe:nbe:" imports show
ed a decrease of 100lt):) i ocket , ;wh!e
exports showed an increase of 18,000
pockets.
Efforts to "bear" the market have
been made by certain New Orleans
brokers and their western allies dur
ing the past few weeks in the hope of
acquiring quantities of rice to be sold
at a big profit later on. The parties
responsible for this attempting raid
upon the producers wrote a number of
letters to jobbers, telling them that
there was a big carry-over, that the
1916 crop was abnorma!!y large and
that the demand would not increase
because northern labor was fu!!y em
ployed at high wages and was not
looking for something to take tihe
place of the high-priced foodstuffs, it
had been accustomed to eating.
These etters have had no effect,
however. The crop is undoubtedly
larger and of better quality than that
of 1915, but not to such an extent
that prices must drop in consequence.
Furthermore, the demand is growing
at a rate to belie the prediction that
the comparative cheapness of rice has
not attracted the attention of north
ern consumers. With everything that
goes to supply the table of the average
Sfamily selling at prices that in many
cases are from 75 to 100 per cent
higher than twelve months ago, rice
is steadily gaining in popularity and
owing to its superior value as food,
will beable to hold its place in the es
timation of the public.
The Southern Rice Growers' asso
ciation feels that it was never in bet
ter position to demand and obtain *a
fair price for the cereal, and if all
of the rice farmers will stand pat
and respect the dead line it has drawn
with a view of giving the market
legitimate and effective support, the
New Orleans and other "bear dope
sters" will reap nothing but a large
crop of bad luck.
NAT'L FARM AND LIVE STOCK
SHOW OPENED BRILLIANTLY
New Orleans, Nov. 13.-The Na
tional Farm and Live Stock Show, the
first really creditable country fair
ever held in New Orleans, opened on
the 11th under the most brilliant and
favorable auspices. Governor Pleas
ant and 'Mayor Behrman were the
chief orators the opening day and on
Shreveport Day Mayor John McWil
liams Ford of the north Louisiana
metropolis came down at the head of
a big aggregation of Shreveport boost
ers and spent the day as the guests of
the management. Mayor Ford was
much gratified over the passage of
amendment number seven allowing
Shreveport to refund her debt and an
ticipate a big increase in 'municipal
improvements on that account. Next
to the State Fair at Shrevep''., the
New Orleans show is the most sue
cessful and elaborate to be held in the
state in many years. Prizes amount
ing to $25,000 will be distributed
among exhibitors of live stock and
farm products.
61LSON PLAYERS HAVE
WELL PLEASED AUDIENCE
The Gilson Players presented "Bar
riers Burned Away" to a big crowd
last night. Space does not permit a
detailed account of their engagement
here, but this is one of the best conm
panies ever seen here. Everyone is
praising them, saying the show isas
good as many charging one dollar.
Tonight (Friday) the play is "The
Broken Rosary", and Saturday night
the side splitting comedy "A HaGbelor's
Honeymoon. Prices the same, 10, 20

e Friends of John M. Parker, recent
progressive candidate for vice presi

i- a member of the Wilson cabinet, sug
a Besting him for secretary of agri
culture in place of Scretary Houston,
e
foi merly of Texas, on the supposition
-s that if McAdoo retires from the treas
ury portfolio, that Houston will be
elevated to that position, thereby leav
i in the agricultural post open.
0 United States Senator R. F. Brou
0 !sod was in New Orleans and had a
0 conference with Mr. Parker. "It can
2not be denied that Parker did Wilson
5 a world of good," said Mr. Broussard.

S1Mr. Martin.
e John Marks, campaign manager for

Sinkling that there might be a change
of seasons this yiear as heretofore, and
t Wednesday morning found the ther
Smometer down to 80 degrees, with a
o thick crust of ice. Those who had not
already done so were hurriedly making
their peace with thecoal man. Isn't
it terrible-after wia are held for eight
'months in the cold grasp of the "ice

SNovember to fnd the demon has cast
