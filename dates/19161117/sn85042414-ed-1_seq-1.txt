Birds Build Nests
]r Very Midst of
The Great Battles
Philadelphia, Nov. 17.—-Birds build
nests in European forests while the
trees are being shelled during artil
lery battles, according to Dr. Arthur
A. Allen, he&d of the department de
voted to bird study at Cornell uni
versity, at the thirty-fourth meeting
of the American ornithologists' union
here.
Dr. Allen said a doctor with an am
bulance corps in France counted
thirty-five species of birds that had
built nests in ruins of buildings and
trenches abandoned by Inhabitants
and soldiers. Artillery Are that sweeps
away entire sections of woods fail to
disturb the birds which happen to be
building there, he added. "The ob
server was able to see a number of
these birds building nests under Are.
The tree in which one of the birds
was making a nt was entirely swept
away by a shell, but a bird on a
neighboring tree kept right on build
ing."
Dr. Allen said he thought the fear
lessness of the birds is due to the
higher temperature of their bodies.
"Courage," he declared Is simply a
matter of temperature. The conven
tion closed tonight after selecting
Cambridge, Mass., as next year*s
meeting place.

Washington, Nov. 17.—An appeal
Jp£ active intsrventien by the United
State* to stop the deportation of Bel
gian workmen into Germany was pre
sented to the state department today
by E. Havenith, the Belgian minister.
The Belgians, Mr. Havenith said,
practically are being compelled to
fight against their own country, con
trary to the laws of nations and hu
manity.
The American government already
has interested itself in this situation
and Charge Grew of the embassy- at
Berlin has been instructed to discuss
it personally with Chancellor von
Bethmann-Hollweg. No formal rep
resentations are authorized but the
charge is directed to point out to the
chancellor that Germany's course
cannot but have an unfortunate effect
upon neutral opinion, particularly in
the United States, where great interest
is felt In the Belgians.
All Business Paralysed.
In making public the communica
tion, the minister issued the follow
ing statement:
"The Belgian minister calls atten
tion to the fact that the unemploy
ment of Belgian workmen is due en
tirely to the action of the German
government which has requisitioned
all the supplies of raw materials and
destroyed the industrial plants by re
moving the machinery. The German
government has absolutely paralyzed
all business in Belgium furthermore,
the German government which claims
to try to encourage Belgian industry,
has imposed a war tax of forty mil
lion francs a month (about twenty
times the normal amount of Belgian
taxation) for the past two years upon
a country which is without business
qnd which Germany herself has im
poverished by war and devastation."
Paris Press Praises JJ. 8.
Paris, Nov. 17.—Secretary of State
Lansing's instructions to Joseph C.
Grew, the American charge at Berlin,
sent on behalf of the Belgian govern
ment to discuss with Dr. von Beth
mann-Hollweg, the German Imperial
chancellor, the question of the de
portation by Germany of Belgians
from their native land, Is regarded
here as of great Importance. The
newspapers discuss it appreciatively
The Temps alluding to the incident
says President Wilson is resolutely
determined to hold to his principles,
undeterred by Mexican complications,
adding that he "intervenes without
fear of contingencies."
The Paris Midi sees in the Instruc
tions of Secretary Lansing the be
ginning of a revolt of neutral nations
against what It callB "the barbarous
and Illegal measures of the central
Po^ra.': "Mr. Wilson," says the
Midi "conscious that he is the head
of the largest neutral nation, which
is renowned in the world for its wide
humanitarian feelings, has taken an
initiative which may possibly awaken
all the sleeping consciences of other
peoples still Indifferent"

Chicago, Nov. 17.—Max W. Ball, of
the United States bureau of mines,
discussed oil production and the need
of conservation of petroleum pro
ducts before the American Mining
congress. With 8.000,000 automobiles
in use In the United States by Janu
ary 1, 1917, the waste of gasoline was
appalling, he said. "Within the last
few weeks," he continued, "I have
seen millions of feet of natural gas
wasting into the air, gas so rich in
gasoline that it dropped from the
trees like an April shower. I have
seen wells capable of yielding 40,
000.000 cubic feet of gas each being
deliberately drowned out by pump
ing water Into the gas Bands.
"Twenty-five to 85 percent is left
underground, 20 to 26 per cent of
the value of oil produced is lost thru
evaporation on storage, 6 per cent
of stored oil is lost through fire.
These losses are staggering and not
exceptional. What a small percentage
of this wonderful natural resource is
saved to run your machine or to de
liver goods at your door or plow the
fields from which your goods must
come."

OF NEW LONDON EAR1Y IN MORNING
Under-sea Craft Struck Tug Terrific Blow—Crew Jumped
Overboard—Captain Fred Hinch Only Man
Saved—Swam to Life Belt.
1 New London, Conn., Nov. 17.—Five members of the
crew of the '*T. A. Scott, Jr.," one of the two tugs accom
I panying the German submarine Deutschland from New
London early today on her return trip to Bremen, were
drowned when the submarine and tug collided in the Race,
about twelve miles from this port.
The only person on the tug saved was Captain Fred
Hinch, of the German interned liner Neckar. The tug
went to the bottom.
The Deutschland returned to her dock here. Officials
declined to discuss the accident. The dead include: Cap
tain John Gurney, Engineer William A. Caton. Fireman
Edward Stone, Cook Clarence Davison and Deckhand Eu
gene Duzant.
The tug and the submarine came together in a rela
tively smooth sea.
When it was apparent that the t«g was fatally rammed, the crew
jumped overboard. Captain Hlnscb swam to a life preserver, thrown
out by the Deutscliland's crew.
The Deutschland drew out of her noolcet at the pier of the Eastern
Forwarding company at 1:30 o'clock this morning, accompanied by two
J*®9, ®"e carried on her homeward dash a cargo valued at $2,000.
... 000 and consisting of nickel, rubber and silver bars.
MADE RAPID PROGRESS.
The trip down harbor was without incident. When last seen by the
newspaper launch, the submarine was plowing through a smooth sea at
the rate of twelve knots, headed for Montauk Point. The moon, in Its
last quarter, touched into color the smooth surface of the sett.
The failure of the tugs to return at an early hour led to much
speculation, but it was believed they would accompany the submersi
ble well beyond the three-mile limit.
Although the Deutechland apparently had boon ready for her dash
for some days, her departure was rattier unexpected. Her skipper. Paul
Koenig. spent the evening in his usual leisurely manner about the city.
He called at two hotels, shaking hands with friends. When asked about
nailing, he smiled, saying he did not know. After the theater, he stroll
ed carelessly down to Hie pier, where the submersible was In readi
ness, with her machinery sinking.
KOEV1G. PALE AVD SHAKEN.
The lights of the pier were extinguished, and the Deutschland
slipped silently down the Thames. Koenig appeared pale and shaken,
as he stepped ashore from his vessel on its return. He refused to talk
about the collision, immediately sending word to Vice President Hilken
of the Eastern Forwarding com pan v. who arrived
:lt
fices shortly afterward. The two held a conference.
In the absence of authoritative information, considerable specula
tion as to the cause of the accident was current. Among shipping men
the opinion is expressed that the steering gear of the submersible mav
be at fault, causing her to run squarely into tlie convoying tug. Hie
blow was a powerful one.
TUG GOT IV WAY.
According to a member of the Deutsehland's crew, the collision
came "all in a minute." He said the tug cot unexpectedly in front of
'lie Deutschland. the distance beina so slight between them that the
submersible luui no chance of avoiding the accident. Her nose struck
the tug near the stern, lifting it well out of the witter, and «wnHrw.
the Scott's nose under, immediately the boilers exploded. The vessel
sank with all aboard.

probably will sail in a few days.

ently is slight, according to officers of the North German Lloyd line
here, who got into long distance telephone communication with offi
