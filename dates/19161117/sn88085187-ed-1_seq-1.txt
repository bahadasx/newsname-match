. NKW LONDON, t'onii..
Nov. 17.—An attempted ilunli
to nea by the Ocnuan uicr
cliaiil submarine I. Ilt.sell

collision betwe«'n tho siiper-
Kiiliiiiorsililo and an pscort
il1v. I'm in which ("apt. Ouer
ncy and lour members of
tho tug's crew MM drowned.
The Deutschland, bound for
Hrenien, put back to port imme
diately after the collision, and
by 5 o'clock this morning wus
imatn warped Into her pier.
Later this morning a report
was circulated that a mysterious
motorboat tried to rain tho
Deutschland and that ln attempt
ing to protect the submarine the
tug swung directly in Ihe path of
the undersea freighter.
Inquiry at the pier of the
Eastern Forwarding Co. brought
no confirmation of this rumor.
The collision occurred ln the
treacherous stretch of water be
tween Fishers and Little Gull Is
lands, known as The Kaco. The
water there is IM feet deep. A
strong current sucked landward
and seaward through tbe narrow
stretch at the mouth of Long Is
land sound, makes it one of the
danger points in that vicinity.
Captain Crushed to Death.
The tug T. A. Scott, Jr., at
tempted to cross the Deutsch
land's bows while the Scott and
the tug Cassis, acting as rear
guard for the submarine, wore
st earning along, at 12 knots.
There was a splitting crash
and a great hole was torn In tbe
Scott Jr.'s side. She broke in
two and sank within three min
utes.
The cre-v had no chance to
reach the l'fe boats. Capt. Guer
ney, in the wheel house. Is be
lieved to have been crushed to
death.
The four sailors who went
down with Guerney were all be
low decks, trapped like rats.
They are Engineer Wm. A. Caton;
Edward Stone, fireman; Eugene
Dusant, deckhand, and Clarence
Davison, cook.
Capt. Hindi Aboard.
Captain Hinch of the Eastern
Forwarding Co., which owns the
Deutschland, was aboard the
Scott Jr., and was thrown into
the water. Sailors from the
Deutschland leaped overboard
and dragged him on the submers
ible. He was nearly dead from
shock «nd cold.
Since the Deutschland came
back here under her own steam,
It is not believed she sustained
any serious damage.
The collision is the second the
vessel has sustained this trip, as
she was rammed in Bremen at
tho time of her start and detained
for 10 days.
As the big boat put out rumors
again were revived regarding a
possible fighting submarine escort
for her.
OH Loaded In Hurry.
The fact that the boat's depar
ture appeared to have been sud
denly decided upon led to belief
that Capt. Koenig had received
word that the submarine cruiser
had appeared off the coast.
Several thousand gallons of oil
were put aboard early last night.
It had been brought in a hurry
by special train.
Eastern Forwarding Co. offi
cials refused to treat seriously ap
prehensions of a man, drossed as
fioers and to put the skids under
party machines which have stood
in the way of popular legislation.
Many signatures were obtained
for the non-partisan and modified
home rule Initiative petitions.
Secretary Taylor presided at the
celebration.
James Bradford, former corpor
ation counsel of Seattle and re
cent candidate for governor on Ihe
progressive ticket, was one of the
chief speakers.
After the addresses, the orches
tra struck up some lively tunes
and the merrymaking started with

only a crank.
Ilelleved Accidental.
Reports of the "mysterious mo
tor boat" being Involved in the ac
cident were scouted early this aft
ernoon.
Tbe collision was generally said
to have been due to the Deutsch
land drawing up too close to the
tug In an effort to hear orders
that were being called through a
megaphone by Capt. Hlnsch.
All lights being out, It was dif
ficult for the Deutschland crew
to judge distance and with the
heavy sea running the 'joats wore
thrown violently together.
Capt. Koenig and members of
his crew were sleeping soundly
aboard the Wlllehad at noon, aft
er their work throughout the
night in preparation for depar

It was expected Koenig and the
officials of the T. A. Scott Co.
would file their official accounts
of the accident at the customs of

COLUSION
MANY WOMEN
SAY THEY WILL
DO OWN BAKING
Mayor I aiw.n has hail an accountant at nor. , too.
This c\|K<rt Kiiilav produced a typewritten sheet of fiK
uii's In which ho not only set forth that the increase In
bread Is not justified, but that the housewife can sate $17.40
on a barrel of flour hy la I. inn her own bread ralher than
paling for the bakery product.
"The man who produced these statistics for me knows tha Inside
of the bakery business. 1 guess that this report will sort of make tha
bakers sit up mid take notice," said (be mayor.
Kawcett's bread figures ure a comparison of prices charged by
local bakers on Aug. 1 of Ibis year nnd on Nov. l. r >.
One barrel of flour will make 2HU loaves of bread, according to
the mayor's expert report. A barrel is equal to lour 4 9-pound sacks.
On Aug. 1, the report shows, bread sold at .OKI a pound, or a
trifle over six cents, and a barrel of flour brought $17.38. On Nor.
11, bread sold at 10 rents a pound, niukitig a barrel of flour bring ir •
$28.50.
The cost of other ingredients lv bread Is compared as follows:
Aug. I. N0v.15.
1 hbl. flour $6.00 $8.75
4 lbs. salt 072 .074
1 lbs. .iikiii 11l .417
4 lbs. lard 64 .68
2 % lbs. yeast 75 .76
$7,161 (10.671
This shows that all ingredients have risen $2.82, for a quantity
Of duugh equivalent to .'Si. pounds of bread.
The difference between $1 1.1. , which the mayor says la the ad
vance in the price of bread, mid |2.82, which be Bays is the advano*
ln the cost of making bread, is $8.30, which Fawcett declare* is tha
needless advance for the bakery trust. Me asserts that the bakers ar*
making $.30 more profits out of 28S pounds of bread than they ar*
entitled to.
Fuwcett shows that the housewife can buy a barrel of flour tor
$0.20, and the Ingredients to go with it total tlie cost of 285 pounds
of bread at $11.10. While the bakers charge $2H...0 for thla quan
tity of bread, the housewife can make the same amount of bread
for $11.10, or save $17.40. This difference does not Include fual
or time.
