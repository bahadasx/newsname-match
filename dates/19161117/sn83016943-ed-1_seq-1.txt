sion has been so amended as to fix the
percentage of increase in the assess
ment of horses at ten per cent and in

Kditor of the Foicon:
It was a hard fight and a close finish,
entir ly too close for comfort until the
result was certain. I staid on dutv
Tuesday night and was right at the bat.
or rather telegraph instrument when
the news from the West ain't the
West fine begin to tell a different tale
from the news that had rome from the
East t'ell with the East in the ear
lier hours. At seven o'clock Wednes
day morning I felt' sure enough of the
result to telegraph to Macon Tatum
Dent that Wilson was elected.
Everything was going fine when at 6
o'clock Tuesday I went out to get some
dinner when I got back about 7' things
were looking blue. Then the Reps, be
gan to celebrate. There were a mil
lion or so automobiles'on Michigan ave
nue and nearly every one gave a deri
sive hoot as it passed our headquarters.
But as I walked home next morning
it was different. The Tribune and
American had big headlines "Hughes
Elected" but the Herald told a differ
ent tale acd somehow the few people
on the street seemed to be Dems. and
had learned the truth.
Saturday night they had a big parade.
1 1 marched with them awhile. Every
body had a fllag and a horn. 1 was
marching just ten feet behind a big
band of forty-pieces and most of the
time I could hear nothing but the bass
drum and now and then a high note
from a cornet. They made as much
ncit e as ten thousand Emmet Roys with
ten thousand horns.
And happy thev were the happiest
crowd I ever saw. The first fancied de
feat seemed to have the effect of doub
ling the joy of victory, and they rubbed
it in on the Reps, with tremendous vigor.
One learns a good many inside facts
up here. What learned at headquarters
need not be mentioned, but outside in
formation h not. confidential. I was
told on excellent authority that Wall
street tried its best to have the Reps,
nominate Roosevelt, but the Old Guard
swore by all that was holy, and unholy
too. that they would nt stanp it." So
Hughes was nominated. Then Roose
velt held off until certain assurances
were given him that is he was prom
ised practically everything he demand
ed, whereupon he refused the Prog,
nomination and came out for Hughes,
He sold out the Progs, absolutely and
thoroughly.
Another thing. Hughes was no re
luctant candidate. A month before the
Rep. convention he could not discuss
the nomination without his voice tremb
ling and his hand shaking, so eager he
was.
Chicago surprised me. I saw the
Wilson reception where a hundred
thousand and more enthusiastically ap
plauded him. I saw the Hughes pa
rade Saturday before election, which
was applauded not at all except by the
paraders themselves. I saw Roosevelt
speak and not half of the audience took
part in the demonstration. And then
Chicago goes for Hughes by 50,000.
They say the high cost of living and the
fear of post-bellum dumping scared the
people at the last.
borne or the cartoons gotten out were
fine. We got out a big posters 10 feet
long 4 feet high with a picture of Wil
son and a workman and his family with
European war scene in the back
ground, the legend being "He protected
me and mine. Ihe Keps. got out a
big poster 10 feet long.,4 feet high with
a picture of Wilson and a workman and
his family with a European war scene
in the back-ground, the legend being
He protected me and mine. The
Reps got out a similar one except that
the family was an American family and
the backgronnd was Mexicans killing
Americans, the legend being "He neg
lected me and mine. " Then we got out
out one with Wilson and some Wall
street bankers and the old "Trust" with
dollar mark clothes, He was crying
and saying "He neglected me and
mine."
Bryan is reported to have said thst
the issue in 1920 will be national prohi
bition. The impression up here, judg
ing by the newspapers, is thtt the
whole country will be dry in ten years.
Even the Tribune admits it. They are
getting off prohibition jokes already
one is of the man who said he was a
teetotaller, but not entirely so. An
other that he favored the prohibition
law but not its strictenforcement.
Some friends I have made here who
have automobiles have been very kind.
Every Sunday for the last month or so
I have been out on all day trips and
have seen all Illinois and Indiana
around Chicago. Much of the country
is very like our prairie country. The
land is a little blacker but apparently
no more fertile. The corn does not
grow near so high but is full of ears.
Alfalfa is grown, that I have seen, on
ly in small patches. Fruit is plentiful
and the wheat fields are large.
The Tribune is still bitterly attacking
the South and also jumped on Califor
nia. The Herald is censuring it and
taking up the cudgels for both. I sug
gest you print enclosed Heraid edi
torial. They do cheer Dixie up here
every time it is played.

The South' "Place In the San"
The South this year will pro
duce 11,000,000 bales of cotton,
worth, with the seed, at least
$100 a bale, or a total of one bil.
lion, one hundred million dollars.
Texas, with 4,000,000 bales, will
cash in to the tune of four hun
dred millions for cotton alone;
Georgia's crop will bring two hun
dred millions; the crops of South
Carolina, Oklahoma and Arkansas
will bring around a hundred mil-
lions to each of these states. All
the South, except the storm and
boll weevil-ridden areas of Miss
issippi and Alabama, are sharing
in the golden flood.
Can we stand such unprece
dented prosperity! Or will it
turn our heads and lead us back
into our old-time follies when cot
ton was king and shared his
throne with none othert
In making our plans for 1917
let ws never forget that while cot
ton is high, everything else is also
high. "With flour at 10 to $12 a
barrel and still going up, with
corn next spring at $1,50 3 bushel,
with fertilizer prices soaring,
wbnt will it avail us if we raise a
big crop of cotton and it all goes
to pay debts for things we should
have grown at hornet
Let us repeat, with all the em
phasis we can, that for the ave
rage Southern farmer there is only
one road to independence and
here it is: plenty of corn for
bread and feed lor livestock; a
field of oats to supplement the
com crop in case or shortage; a
good pasture to furnish grazing
for cattle, hogs and horses; milk
cows enougn to lurnish plenty 0;
milk and butter the year round;
L.14 flock of hens to supply the
table and help pay grocery bills;
