New London, Nov. 17. Five lives
were lost when the German subma
rine Deutschland, which left port early
today for Bremen, rammed and sent
to the bottom with its crew of five
the tug T. A. Scott, jr.. one of its two
convoying tugs. After the accident
the Deutschland returned to port. The
dead:
CAPTAIN' JOHN' Gl'RXET.
WILLIAM A. ('ATOM, engineer.
EDWARD STONE, fireman.
CLARENCE R. DAVIDSON, cook.
El'GENE Dl'ZAXT, deck hand.
The collision occurred about a mile
inside the race and. according to a
member of the Deutschland's crew,
came "all in a minute." . The tug, he
."Hid. got unexpectedly in front of the
Deutschland, the distance being so
slight between them that the submer
sible had no chance of avoiding the
accident. Her nose struck the tug
near the stern, lifting it well out of
the water and sending the Scott's nose
under. Almost immediately afterward
the boiler of the tug exploded and the
vessel sank with all on board.
apt. Fred Hinsch, of the interned
German steamer Neckar, who was on
the tug. grasped a guy rope and was
drawn down with the tug. WThen he
rose to the surface he managed to
grasp a life preserver which had been
thrown out by the Deutschland and
was taken on board the vessel, by
which he was brought back to New
London.
The Deutschland was not seriously
damaged, it was stated, and probably
would be ready to sail in a few days
when repairs ha 1 been made. Sev
eral of the bowplates were bent and
the rivet.s loosened, but the interior
of the submarine was not damaged.
Thp repairs will be made by members
of the crew.
Struck Dangerous Eddy.
An eddy caused the accident, ac
cording to Capt. Harry Baker of the
tug Cassie, a convoyer of the subma
rine. The Cassie was traveling about
half a mile astern of the Deutschland
while the Scott and the submarine
were moving about abreast. The sea
was calm, Captain Baker said, and
conditions were normal. The Scott
carried the usual lights but the
Deutschland had only her headlight
and two side lights.
The tide was running almost full
rind when about seven miles west of
Itace Rock they struck an eddy which
twisted them about and out of con
trol. Shortly afterward thiy came to
gether. He heard the crash. The
night ..us clear, he said, and there
were no boats othr than the two tugs
anil the submarine Deutschland in the
vicinity He pave no credence tw re
ports that a hostile motor boat was
approaching the submarine at the time
of the accident. Captain Baker said
that when the collision occurred he
at once headed for the spot. On ar
riving there he saw ' I. plain Hinsch in
the water and took him on hoard the
Cassie. Earlier reports had it :hut
Hinsch had been rescued by the
Deutschland.
Hole in Deutsc-hlaml.
Henry a. Hilken of Baltimore,
president of the Eastern Forwarding
company said that so far as he knew
the only damage the Deutchland suf
fered was a twisted stem. It was
learned later, however, that the un
dersea boat has in her bow at least
one hole about 20 inches square. A
portable forge was taken down to the
pier and the hole is being patched.
t.apt. v . a. rones, snore superintend
ent of the Scott company, in charge
of the repairs, said he expected that
the Deutschland would be ready to
leave within two or three days.
Reports that U-boat with gun
mounted, was waitin- outside the
three mile limit supposedly to convoy
the Deutschland, failed of confirma

Left New London at 1:30 a. m.
New London. Nov. 17. Five mem
be -s of the crew of one of the tugs
which accompa tied the German sub
marine Deutschland from New Lon
don early today on her return trip to
Bremen were drowned when the sub
mersible and the tug collided in the
race about twelve miies from this port.
The only person on the t g saved was
Captain Fred Hinsch of the German
interned liner Neckar. The tug was
the T. A. Scott, jr., which 1 elonged to
the T. A. Scott Wrecking company
It went to the bottom.
The Deutschland returned to her
dock here at 5:15 a. m. Officials de
clined to discuss the accident or to telt
f extent of the damage inflicted on
the submarine.
Hit In a Smooth sea.
The tug and the submarine came to
gether in a relatively smooth sea.
When it was apparent that the tug
was fatally rammed, the crew jumped
overboard. Captain Hinsch swam to a
life preserver thrown out by the
Deutschland's rew.
The Deutschland drew out of her
pocket at the pier of the Eastern For

Frank D. Ayres, assistant corporation
counsel, who is aiding in supervising

Commission Is Idea
and
Radical Changes Suggested by
1917 Legislators.
John Ostlind, jr., representative
from Mcpherson county, wants all
state institutions placed under one
board of managers. He will intro
duce a bill for a consolidation of all
state boards when the legislature con
venes in Topeka, in January. Under
the plan as outlined by the McPher
son legislator, the governor will be
made ex-officio member of the board.
Nearly twenty members of the state
legislature have written to Topeka an
nouncing that they will fight for the
abolition of all useless boards and
commissions. It is a big, broad state
ment and probably sounds ferocious
to the voters, in the rural districts.
But the useless board and commission
theory appears to be a debatable issue.
To date none of the members of the
1917 .legislature has indicated the use
less board and commissions which are
to be legislated out of business. Ost
lind, however, takes a free swing at all
boards and commissions and proposes
to cut down the state payroll inf a
manner that will mean something.
"I am a radical on economy and
will insist on abolishing all useless
boards and commissions writes Ost
lind, in a manner indicating that he
has taken someone's campaign speech
seriously. So the Mcpherson man who
is returning to the legislature for his
third term, proposes to make state
departments weep if it becomes real
ity. He proposes to place "To Let"
signs on the floors of various state
offices and commissions. Ju&t to
show that he holds no grudge, Ost
lind suggests that all state boards and
commissions be wiped out.

man. Neither Washburn nor Fairmount
was able to score in the first period
of today's game on the Washburn
field. Neither team was able to
gain any apparent advantage, the
Ichabods holding tight against the
heavier Fairmount eleven.
Owing to the fact that the Wash
burn commissary was shy on adhesive
tape, the Washburn players were late
in suiting up. However, they appeared
on the field at 2:31 o'clock.
Despite the fact that it was an ideal
football day. the crowd was small.
Coach Hoover, who stated that his
team would average 175 pounds to the
man, switched his lineup at the last
minute, stating that for the first time
in several weeks he had all his stars
.'n action, and was confident that the
score would be close.
The Wheatshockers arrived in To
peka at an early hour this morning
and went immediately to the Y. M.
C. A. where they made headquarters
while In Topeka. This morning they
appeared to think tnat tney naa an
excellent chance of winning and were
ready. Coach Hoover said, to put up
one of their best fights of the season.

The placing of Captain Stewart at
quarterback by the Washburn mentor
indicated that he intends to use Ste
wart at this position during the re

ly stated that he wanted today's team
to remain intact if possible.
Few changes were made from last

where Shaw was placed instead of

to all Russian representatives in allied
countries declaring Russia's firm de
termination not to make a separate
peace under any circumstances, ac
cording to the semi-official news
agency. The text of the telegram la
as follows:
"Reports spread abroad recently by
the press of certain countries of pre

which binds her to her valiant allies

"It has long been the custom of our

to Almighty God for his many bless
ings and mercies to us and the nation.
"The year that has elapsed since we
last observed our day of thanksgiving
has been rich in blessings to us as a
people, but the whole face of the world
has been darkened by war. In the
midst of peace and haooiness our
thoughts dwell with painful disquiet
upon me struggles and sufferings of
the nations at war and of the .'people
upon whom war has brought disaster
without choice or possibility of escape
mcir pan. we can not think of
our own happiness without thinking
of their pitiful distress.
"Now, therefore. I. Woortrnw wit-
"soit, president wf the United States of
America,, do appoint Thursday, the
30th of November, as a day of nation
al thanksgiving and prayer, and urge
and advise the people to resort to their

the blessings of peace and unbroken
prosperity which he has bestowed
upon our beloved country in such un
stinted measure.
Show Thanks by Giving.
"And I also urge and suggest our
duty tn this our day of peace and
abundance, to think in deep sympathy
of the stricken people of the world
upon whom the curse and terror of
war has so pitilessly fallen and to con
tribute out of our abundant means to
the relief of their sufferings.
"Our people could in no better
show their real attitude towards the
present struggle of the nations than
by contributing out of their abundance
to the relief of the suffering which
war has brought in its train.
"In witness whereof, I have here
unto set my hand and caused the seal
of the United States to be affixei.
"Done in the city of Washington

London, Nov. 17. Fall of Monastir

toward the Macedonian city of
French, Italian, Russian and Serbian
forces. Fighting thru snow, sleet and
mud the four allies have impetuously

General Serrail refused to be
drawn into attacking the Bulgarian
defenses to the south of Monastir
defenses which Sofia' some time ago
pronounced impregnable. But, ac
cording to all reports which reached
here he has forced retirement of the
Bulgarian-Teuton defenders from
these positions without their hardly

Fall of Monastir will be a distinct
blow at Bulgarian pride, and experts
