Practical Economy.
Baking powders made from alum" or
phosphate may bo bought for a trifle less
than Royal Baking Powder, which is made
from cream of tartar, derived from gropes.
Alum powders are not only cheap, but
they differ, greatly in leavening power.
If a cheap baking powder is used for a
fine cake and the cake turns out a failure ,
there is a waste of costly materials worth
more than 'a whole can of the cheap bak-,
ing powder.
Royal Baking Powder produces the
finest food, and its use therefore, results in
an actual saving.

-Thanksgiving
Vrom the time of the landing of
the Hlgrim Fathers, Americans
have been accustomed to set
aside one day in the year wherein
to review the past year and take stock
of the dealings of Providence with us
as a people.
What was a first the spontaneous
expression of grateful hearts soon be
came fixed, a custom,' and as the
years sped this custom .became fixed,
untilioday it-assumes the sacredness
ofa permanent institution. .,
This season is again with us. The
fruits of the broad acres of our fair
domain have been garnered in. The
warehouse's and graneries are fairly
bursting with their contents and pros
perity sets a guest at almost every! fire -
side.
Our President and the governors of
the various states have designated the
dav on which the people shall express
to a bountiful Creator their gratitude
for these blessings.
And to the many positive and mat
erial blessings which have been ours,
there is added on this occasion the es
pecial blessing that we as people have
escaped the madness that has fallen
as a blight upon our neighbors and
kinsmen across the waters. The mag
nitude of that blessing we cannot at
this time begin to estimate.
But while we have these palpable
blessings for which to be thankful,
we have other things for which tp ex
press our gratitude, and these antedate
and underlie our present happiness
and prosperity our peace and safety.
We have to be thankful that back in
the days when our nation was being
born, a land of heroes, than whom
the, world has never produced greater
had impression upon their hearts to
lay the f.oundationsof that
nation upon the only possible
true and lasting base the Father
hood of an omnipotent God and the
brotherhood of man.
And over and aboye all else, we
have to be thankful that a meociful
God has" so moulbed the hearts and
lives of tee people of this nation;; that
we are enabled to look above and be
yond self and' see for ourselves the
great principles of eternal truth and
justice that must ultimately rule the
whole earth ; that we are enabled to
grasp the truth that an injury to our
selves, and that a kindness to our
follows calls down a benediction up
on our own heads.
So that the one supreme blessjng
for which we should at this season
return thanks, is the tact that our
God lias enabled us as a people to
to know and to do the Right.
And let our prayer be, that it may
ever be thus with this people.

Needs Drastic Action
The holding ot freight cars idle
while speculators await a rise in coal
or wheat, paying 1 dollar a day the
while, must seem an intolerablejprac
tice to any one who remembers the
congestion caused by he car shortage
in this city some months ago. The
proposal of the Panns'ylvania Railroad
to raise the demurrage charges ou a
sliding scale as a curb upon speculat
ion can hardly meet with reasonable
opposition.-Philadelphia Ledger.
