REVIEW DOLL AND TOY FUND
The Banks of Morgan City Lend Aid In Collecting Coo
(filiations. All Donations to be Distributed
by the King's Daughters
The Bank of Morgan City, the
First National Bank of Morgan City
and the Peoples State and Saving
Bank of Morgan City have lent their
valued services as recipients of do
nations for the Review Doll and Toy
Fund which is to be distributed in
the shape of dolls and toys among
the little poor children of Morgan
City at Christmas time. Every
man, woman and child who under
stands the nature of this movement
will be glad to contribute towards
making the Doll and Toy Fund for
this year the biggest that has ever
blessed those little old victims of
somebody else's hard luck *or mis
management.
Whether the impoverished con
dition of a number of those little old
chaps is due to aforesaid hard luck
or mismanagement, the fact remains
that those who suffer the most are
not in any manner to blame and it
is to brighten their lives and help
them to a few of the happinesses that
are so common to you and yours
that Doll and Toy Funds are found
to be necessary.

'ROMEO AND JULIET"
Beverly Bayne, the charming and
gifted young artist, who is starred
with Francis X. Bushman in the
elaborate eight-part screen produc
tion of "Romeo and Juliet," was
born in Minneapolis, Minn. She has
been in motion pictures for five
years and during that time has ap
peared in more than five hundred.
She is now twenty-two years old.
Miss Bayne's advent into pictùres
was most nnusnal. Together with a
party of girl friends, she went to the
Essanay studio in Chicago one day
to see how motion pictures were
made. The director was immediately
struck by her remarkable beauty and
grace. He asked Miss Bayne' if she
would care to take a position in the
studio. The idea struck her as being
preposterous, and she declined the
proffer. The next day the director
called her up at her home and re
peated the offer. Miss Bayne con
sulted her aunt about it, and the
aunt advised her to make one trial,
just for the experience. Miss Bayne
has the distinction of being starred
in her very first picture. She has
been a star, and an exceedingly
populär one, ever since.
Miss Bayne attended the public
schools in Minneapolis, and then her
parents removed to Chicago, where
I feel the pangs of poverty. Yet, they
| are here and if you will go out and
look for them you will perhaps find
more of them than you expected to
find. And when you stop to think
just what Christmas and old Sandy
Claws mean to you and your
friends and your tiny tots, and that
just a little contribution from you
will scatter sunshine over the lives
of some little unfortunate who is
out of reach 'of the good things you
and yours enjoy then you will dig
into your resources and make your
self known as one of the bunch of
"Goodfellows" who feel that they
are in some measure their "brother's
keeper."
Dont delay adding your name to
the list of contributors to the Doll
and Toy Fund. The fund is fairly
started now and the list is open to
you with the invitation to give just
as much or as little as you feel able
to give.

she was graduated from the Hyde
Park High School. She had just
started a course in a finishing sehool
in Philadelphia, and was home on her
vacation when she went into pic
tures. Miss Bayne has dark brown
hair and large attractive brown
eyes. That she is but a. trifle more
than five feet in height'will be a
surprise to her many admirers, as
she often appears in roles where she
appears much taller. Her remarkable
versatility is attested by the fact
that she has played everything from
an ingenue to an elderly woman.
Since becomming a motion pic
ture star Miss Bayne has found her
athletic training during her high
school days a valuable asset. In ad
dition she has learned to ride, fence,
drive racing cars and motor-boats,
to sail, and other valuable accom
plishments in a motion picture star's
life. Miss Bayne is talented in many
other respects and among other
things is a writer of rare ability.
She possesses a beautiful soprano
voice and plays the piano and violin.
Since she has been with Metro, Miss
Bayne has appeared in many notable
productions, including "Penningtons
Choice," "A Million a Minute," "The
Wall Between" and "Man and His
Soul."
This picture will be shown at the
Evangeline soon.
