Weather cold but participants
warm with enthusiasm. Long line
of cavalry, torch bearers, floats.
Women contribute most.
Weather conditions were such
Sunday and Monday that those
of the arrangement Committee
had serious ideas of postponing
the event in celebration of the
election f Mr. Wilson, Col.
Gardner -nd Judge Rucker, set
for Tuesday afternoon and night.
However, Tuesday dawned clear
and cold and it was decided to
go on with the jubilant affair.
Advertising had been suppressed
to a considerable extent and pre
parations halted on account of
the cold, but a few energetic
women and men kept busy with
the result that a magnificent dis
play of floats and decorations for
floaters were prepared. Jinyny
J.'aylor flourished a marking pot
brash as he never did before on
banners. J. J Moore worked
harder than if his railroad track
had slipped off the ties; Mrs. B.
Hughes, Mrs. Ed Williams and
several other enthusiastic rebel
democratic women "worked for
three consecutive days like Bel
gians and the result, the grand
est equipment for a Democratic
celebration (minus the liquids)
ever. The Roanoke band arriv
ed early in the afternoon and de
lightfully entertained the crowd
as it gathered. Many who came
were bluffed by the increasing
cold enjoyed the music for a
while and put out for home. By
six o'clock the streets were filled
with girls and bovs on horses
Hon. Paul Prosser, the only
speaker for the event, Judge
Rucker having been called away,
was on hand. At 7 o'clock Grand
Marshal, Warner Ford and his
assistants began to form the
long line of torch bearers, on
horses and on foot and air to the
booming of the big Canon which
was in the line, the parade start
ed with Grand Marshal Ford at
its head and Miss Helen Zillman
and AI Wilks next at the head
of the Cavalry.

Marching as nearly all over
tnwn as such a long time could,
to the military music of the band
the booming of the cannon and
the shouts for Wilson, Gardner,
and Rucker and a few bunched
applauders for prohibition, the
line broke at the point it started.
The city lights were bad, inade-
quat ebut the throng which brav-
red the cold to see and hear wit
nessed a grand sight.
The court house jammed to
hear Mr. Prosser and those who
heard him declare no better
speech has been made in the
county excepting that of Mr.
Atwood. The 'committees in
charge of the celebration are to
be congratulated on the success
attending their efforts and the
women deserve especial praise.
The young women and men
from the county who formed so
important part of the parade
have the grateful acknowledge
ment of all.
