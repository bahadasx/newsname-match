GIGANTIC DRIVE OF
OZARK TRAIL GANG
GETTING UNDER WAY
Volunteers are Called For; Must Report

Tomorrow Night; Regiment
Will Meet Warriors From
West Monday
The command for all motorists to
mobilize in preparation for the inva
sion of Oklahoma City where the
Ozark Trail convention will be held
on Tuesday and Wednesday next
week, preceded by a huj:e demonstra
' tiou on Monday, has gone forth from
the generalissimo of the Chickasha
army and his staff and woe be unto
him who is so lacking in patriotism
that he fails to heed the call to arms.
E. C. Burton, chairman of the com
mittee in charge of arrangements for
the expedition, has held a conference
with his associates and all plans have
been agreed upon. The, official
"dope," straight) from headauarters,
Is as follows:
All car owners who have not al
ready volunteered to make the trip to
r.lnonia City Monday are requested
to come to the rescue by signing one
of the lists at the following places:
Owl drug store, Brownson's, Barton
Bros, garage, Wolvertou's Ford agen
cy, Boone &Rickerts garage. This
must be done before Saturday noon
as the complete list will be published
tomorrow aft",-'.ioon.
On Saturday night there will be a
grand rally of all good roads enthu
siasts at the corner of Fourth and
Chickasha avenue and everybody is
commanded to be there.. While not
officially decreed, the probabilities
are that another block or two of as
phalt will be burned and a few picked
orators will "make the welkin ring"
and perhaps some sixteen inch guns
will be fired.
The band is already employed to
accompany the Chickasha boosters to
Oklahoma City Monday.
Over two hundred cars from the
western and southwestern part of the
state will be in Chickasha at noon I
Mottday, according to information re
ceived by Mr. Burton, bringing several
bands with them, and the Chickasha
delegation will join them in the trip
to Oklahoma City. The Chickasha
contingent mill meet the western forc
es at the railroad crossing on the Po
casset road northwest of town and

It was just like taking candy from

shortly before 8 o'clock last night and
mako good their escape before offi

This was for two reasons. It was not

to them was unavailing. Hardeman,
