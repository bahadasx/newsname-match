German Submarine is Not Ser

Turns Back into Port.
FRENCH ' HINSCH ESCAPES
Tug Gets Unexpectedly in Front J
of Submarine and Collision
is Unavoidable.
(MT I'SSCCUTft) /
NEW LONDON. Ct.. Nov. 17.?
11 ?.-? *??i ? <* ? 1
jr n ca lives were rusi wneii me uerman
submarine Deutschland. which
left port early today for Bremen. *
rammed and sent to the bottom with ?
its crew of five the tug T. A. Scott,
Jr., ohe of its two convoying tugs, i
After the accident the . Deutschlgnd 1
returned to port. The dead are Cap- <
tain John Gurney, William A. Caton. i
engineer; Edward Stone, fireman;
Clarence B. Davisson, cook; Eugene
Duzant, deck hand.
The collision occurred about a mile 1
inside the race and according to a 1
member of the Deutschland's crew <
came "all In a minute." The tug, i
he said, got unexpectedly in front 1
of the Deutschland, the distance be- i
ing so slight between them that the
suDmersiDie naa no cnance or avoid- {
ing the accident. Its nose struck ,
the tug near the stern, sending the ,
Scott's nose under. Almost Iminedi- (
ately afterward the boilers on the (
tug exploded and the vessel sank ,
vsrlth all on board. 4
Captain French Hinsch of the in- <
terned German steamer Neckar, who j
was on the tug, grasped a guy rope j
and was drawn down with the tug. \
"When he rose to the surface he man- j
aged to grasp a life preserver which
had been thrown out by the Deutsch- 4
land and was taken on board the
vessel, by which he was brought back i
to New London.
The Deutschland was not serious- ,
ly damaged and probably will be
ready to sail in a few days. Several j
f the bow plates were bent and the j
rivets loosened, but the interior of (
the submarine was not damaged. ^
The repairs will be made by mem- j
bers of the crew.
Vice President Paul G. Hilken of E
.the Eastern Forwarding Company, ,
American agents for the undersea, i
line, said Friday that ' a statement ;
would be issued by the company <
probably Friday night, as soon as it ,
was in possession of full information, j
He added: ?
(<mi j ? ? ^ f At _ r> j.i_ _
jue urowmng ui me crew 01 tne
tug T. A. Scott,-Jr., is a much regret- i
table occurrence and none feels it i
more keenly than the officials of the r
forwarding company and the officers 1
and,men on the Deutschland. That '<
it was unavoidable goes without say- ?
ing." 1

report from the customs collector at t

sustain a public report that a hostile

Secretary Daniels has called for a <

The German embassy regarded the :
accident as being especially deplora- 1

LISION IN
FOUNDER OF
FARMS l
4
At the First Session of State
Conferences of Charities
and Corrections Here.
Dr. H. H. Cooley, founder of tho
Cooley farms, Cleveland, will be one i
>f the speakers at the first session of
he state Conference of Charities and
Correction to be opened in the Masonic
temple Monday at/2 p. m.
How Is Harrison county caring for
ts poor, especially at the county inirmary?
How are other counties
jaring for theirs? Does a county
leed a 100 acre farm and an expensive
building for the care of a few
iged persons, mostly women? Is
such an institution the best place In
which to house tramps comfortably
in winter. Indeed is that the best way
3f meeting the problems? These are
some of the questions that will be
Drought up for discussion at the first
session of this conference.
The institution better known as
he Warrensville farm colony, of
which Dr. Cooley is j.t the head, is a
wonderful institution, owned by the
:ity of Cleveland and widely known
for its great work of charity and
:orrection. The property represents
in investment or over $0UU,UUU, ana
Cleveland's unfortunate, delinquent
people as -well as the sick and the
poor are here protected and cared for
for their own sake as well as for the
protection of the community.
The farm consists of about 2,000
icres, located at Warrensville, O.,
md Is commonly known as the
Cooley farm or the place of residence
pf the Infirmary or almshouse gToup
pf people; the Overlook farm, on
which is erected the new sanatorium
'or tuberculosis patients; the Correction
farm, on which is the workhouse
pr house of correction group; and
he Highland Park farm, on which
las been laid out a magnificent municipal
cemetery. JSah one of these
separate farmw consist approximately
pf 500 acres of land. Together they
torm n. great tract in one body of over
2,000 acres, or more than three
square miles, which furnishes a favorable
environment and varied opportunities
for work to the residents
ind inmates of the different villages.
The tuberculosis sanatorium was
nade possible by the $250,000 bond
ssue voted for by the city in 1910.
The building stands 600 feet above
he citv and is nrotected on the north
md northwest by a forest of seventy
teres, while from the other sides it
ooks out over miles of surrounding
country. Before erecting these peril
an ent buildings, for seven years,
;he city maintained a temporary sanitorium
with accommodation for
ibout eighty patients, in which, in
ill, 1,248 cases were treated, and
,he success of the treatment justified i
he expenditure of the larger amount'
:or permanent buildings.
The boys' farm consists of about j
159 acres wtlh buildings costing |
512,300 and was opened in July,
1903. The boys are all sent from
juvenile courts and housed in eight
;ottages with a master and matron.
There are from sixteen to twenty
Doys in a cottage.
The tract of thirty-seven acres adjoining
the Cooley farm and thei
'arm house has been taken over for
he .care of girls.
Such other notable speakers as Dr.
Sooley will' be heard at other seslions
of the conference and It would
je well for our city and county au:horities
who have to dealxwith our
lelinquents to attend this^series of
ectures.

WILL SPEAK
BUSINESS MEN
HOLD MEETING
At Fairmont and Discuss Legislation
Which They Hope
to Have Passed.
At a sectional "meeting of tlie West
Virginia Business Men's Association
held in Fairmont Thursday future
legislation was discussed. One of
the matters taken up and argued
npon was that there should be a law
passed curbing peddlers and auctioneers.
If this law is passed
hawkers on the streets will be a
thing of the past.
The business men also want to
protect themselves against the bad
check business. While there Is a law
in reference to this the merchants
claim that they do not have the full
protection In as much as there is no
penalty attached when a worthless
check is given in paying off an old
account. The business men want the
passers of bad checks punished under
any condition in which they vio?'l
-?.i? ji *
iato me law.
Another thing1 the conference considered
was the repealing of the personal
property exemption law. The
present statute, acording to business
men, is unsatisfactory.
Those present at the . meeting
were L. P. Souders, president,
Clarksburg; Robert Pollard, vice
president, Clarksburg; Robert Poland,
vice president, Martinsburg;
