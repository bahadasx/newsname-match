THE GRAND CANYON MADE NATIONAL PARK
By tho failure of Congress to pass
a law making a national park of tho
Grand Canyon that world's wonder
will lose a $1,000,000 appropriation by
tho Santa Fo Railroad. "The manage
ment has expended more than $1,000,
000 on a branch lino to the canyon,
and in providing hotel facilities, roads,
trails and otherwise developing the
region," W. J. Black, passenger traffic
manager of the Santa Fe, 'said. "Wo
" don't expect to get this money back,
and are in luck if wo make expenses.
The Santa Fo has felt that it owed a
duty to i(s transcontinental patrons
to make their stay at the canyon as
pleasant as possible. There's a limit,
though, beyond which we would not
bo justified in going, even with that
laudable end in view.Thnt limit seems
to have been reached.
"The Grand Canyon is acknowledg
ed to be more than a local wonder, its
famous world wide. As such the least
that Uncle Sam can do is to give it
the same consideration as national
parks. It is hard to understand why
there should be any opposition to this
program. The marvel is that tho
people of Arizona do not demand that
. the canyon bo put where it rightly
belongs. The Santa Fo stands ready
to go ahead and co-operate with the
government whenever the latter will
take an interest"
Tho above article is from the St.
Louis Globe-Democrat and many peo
ple ara wondering why the govern
ment of the United States does not
make that great wonder, a National
Park.
Most people locally would greatly
favor the proposed park, but for the
fact that a great area of country will
, be mapped out to go into it, country
that will not be valuable for a park,
vast areas of a country that could and
should be used for grazing and for
t ' tho homes of the pioneer who is will
ing to take tho chances of making his
homo there.
A recent map of tho area proposed
to bo put into tho park jogs along the
rim of tho canyon back to a one, two
' and three mile limit. This limit along
tho east lines seems reasonable and
would take up the country along the
rim of tho canyon that could be rea
sonably used as a National Park. To
tho west, however, the limits extend
out into townships of country that are
absolutely worthless for any such
4jr purpose. If thi3 scope of country,
which is usefull to the state as a
grazing grounds and for homestead
ers, where they are able to develop
water, was eliminated, there would
bo no objection to the National Park
idea, for the people realize that in the
Grand Canyon they have one of tha
greatest assets of the Southwest, if
not the whole nation, and arc willing
to see it made a National Park. It
undoubtedly would attract more peo
ple and money to the state than any
other one thing.
But why should a great area of
1 country be included? Why is it not
i possible to settle upon reasonable
J lines and give the state tho area that
$ belong to it which area i not in any-
way necessary for the park?
The trouble heretofore has been
that the young men of the different
departments sent out in the west to
look over such projects Indian reser
vations, national forests and national
parks, had the idea that they were
putting a feather in their cap by ad
ding as many millions acres as they
possibly-ould to their pet scheme.
The people of Arizona want a Na
tional Park made of the Grand Can
yon, but they arc honest in their con-
tcntion that there is no need of taking
in a vast area of country which is an
asset to the state and the people, just
to make a big showing as to area.
The Nation as well as the State are
losers when such ill-advised schemes
are put over; the nation loses in pay
ing for that which" it does not get and
k ' the state in losing that which the
people should have had.

MORE STREET PAVING IN
PROSPECT NEXT SPRING
J. D. Morton, general manager of
the California-Arizona Construction
company for the state of Arizona, and
Sidney J. Gassman, his chief clerk,
were in Flagstaff this week fnftn Las
Vegas, N. M., whore the compa jy has
been paving streets ifor that city.
There 1b a movement on foot among
property owners to pave a number of
more blocks next spring, including
blocks in the residence part of tho
city. The good advertising that Flag
staff has received from all parts of
tho state because of tho great im
provement made in our street condi
tions, could not bo bought for twice
the valuo of the paving, and tho pro
perty has been increased in value
many times the cost
If a town is to be built up, it is
absolutely necessary that a start is
made along that line somewhere, and
tho paving of the streets gave the
city of Flagstaff that strong start on
its waf to prosperity and to a bigger
and better city.
TWO MEXICAN WQRKiNGMEN
KILLED MONDAY MORNING
Jose Ibarra and Jaun Salcido, two
Mexican workingmen, were struck by
the east bound passenger train No. 8
Wednesday morning near the stock
yards and instantly killed.
The two men have been working
with County Engineer W. H. Power's
road gang on the county read between
here and Cliffs. They lived in Flag
staff and were walking on the west
bound track until a freight train
loomed up ahead of them. Despite
the motioning and signals to them by
the engineer and fireman of the on
coming freight train, endeavoring to
call their attention to the cast bound
passenger train they stepped over in
front of it and were instantly killed.
One man was thrown .Jully seventy
five feet ahead and between the two
tracks, but out of the way of -the
wheels, of tho train. The other was
thrown clear of the tracks and down
the embankment made by the grade.
Their bodies were crushed and
broken causing death the instant they
were struck.
The crew of the freight train
brought in the report of the accident
and the bodies were immediately
brought to Flagsatff.
Ibarra was a married man with
three children, Salcido had no family
here and it was not known whether he
was a man of family or not
Coroner Harrington held an inquest
over the dead men and the jury re-
! turned a verdict of accidental death.
Death of J. C. Tchan
The sad news reached here Monday
of the death of James C. Tehan, at
the hospital in Prescott where he has
been all summer. Mr. Tehan wa3 a
newspaper man in Milwaukee, but his
health failing him he came to Wins
low five years ago hoping the Arizona
cHmatc would prove beneficial. He
gradually kept failing in strength,
and last fall he went to Needles to
spend the winter, but realizing the
end was near he went to the Prescott
hospital. With him at the time of his
death was his wife and his brother-in-law
Mr. Ryan of Milwaukee. The
body was taken east for burial at his
old home.
Mr. Tchan made hosts of warm
friends during his residence here, and
notwithstanding his physical affliction
he was always pleasant and happy,
entering heartily into all civic mat
ters, serving for a time as secretary
of the local commercial club. His
spirit has flown, but the memory of
his patient life will linger. Winslow

Mr. Tehan was well known here
whero he lived a year or so before
going to Winsl6w.
Cold Waver Pretty General East
The cold wave and raw wind which
swept Flagstaff and northern Arizona
Monday and Tuesday, appears to have
been an overflow meeting of elements
in New Mexico, Colorado and cast. A
record drop of the termometer was
recorded in many of these states. In
Wyoming it was 26 below zero, and
two "below in Denver, consequently
we have nothing much to complain of
as it was six abovo here the coldest

DR. L
. ASTRONOMER DIES SUDDENLY
Man of World Wide Fame Passes Away Sunday
Stricken with Paralysis Dies- Sunday Night
Flagstaff Mourns the Los's'of 'One Who
Carried Flagstaffs Name to Four
Corners of the Earth
The people of Flagstaff were deeply
grieved to learn of the sudden death
of Dr. Percival Lowell Monday morn
ing, for he had seemed to be in the
best of health Saturday when he had
been down town from the observatory.
He was taken suddenly Sunday morn
ing with an attack of apoplexy, but
few knew of his illness. Sunday ho
failed to rally from the attack, though
every effort was made to save his life,
and he finally passed into that great
realm wherein he had searched for tho
hidden mysteries of the othor worlds.
He had a mind of wonderful scope
and, he has made the nations of the
world think.
Mortal men can do no more than
add to human knowledge; Dr. Lowell.
did. The accumulated knowledge of
the years to come, will but add to his
fame as a pioneer scientist with the
courage of his convictions. It is only
a MAN at this particular stage of the
world's development, who' is willing
to declare his findings; regardless of
the popular clamor or sentiment of
the thoughtless talkers.
Percival Lowell was born in Boston
March 13, 1855, son of Augustus and
Katherine Lawrence Lowell; graduat
ed from Harvard 1876; received hon
orary L. L. D. from Amherst 1907,
ana Ularlc lUO'J; eminent as a scicn-t
tist and author on mathematics,
Orientalism and astronomy.
One of the founders of the Mathe
matical and Physical Club of Boston.
Traveled extensively in Japan and
Korea. In 1883 ho was appointed-!
Foreign Secretary and Councillor off
tho Korean Embassy to the United
States and was one of the- first fore
igners in Korea. For a number of
years he lived in Japan, and has writ
ten several books on Japan.
" He became interested in astronomy
in 1870, and in 1894 founded Lowell
Observatory, Flagstaff, Arizona, for
the purpose of scientific research,
especially for the study of the planet
Mars. For his discoveries concerning
Mars, he received world-wide fame,
and was conceded.to be the authority
on this subject. He has made many
important contributions to our knowl
edge of the other members of the
Solar System, and to Mathematical
and Physical Astronomy.
Dr. Lowell was Me'mbcr of Corpo
ration and Non-resident Professor of
Astronomy of Massachusetts Instituto
of Technology. He received the Jans
sen Medal Societc Astronomiquc dc
France, 1904, and the Medal Socicdad
Astronomica de Mexico for his stud
ies on Mars, 1908. He was a Fellow
of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences, Fellow American Asso
tion for the Advancement of Science, I
member of the American Philosophic
al Society, American Astronomical,
and .Astrophysical Society, Astrono
mische Gcscllschaft; Societe Astrono-i
miquo cfe France, Honorary Member.
Socicdad Antonio Alzalte Mexico;
Honorary Member of Sociedad Astro-1

Beige d' Astronomique, American
Geographical and National Geogra
phic Societies. Also a member of
Royal Asiatic Society of Great Brit
ain and Ireland and Asiatic So
ciety of Japan, and Royal Astronom
ical Society of Canada.
Some of his published books arc:
"Occult Japan," "Choson; the Land
of the Morning Calm," "Mars," "Solar
System," "Mars and its Canals,"
"Mars as the Abode of Life," "Evolu
tion of Worlds," and many contribu
tions to scientific magazines.
Recently Dr. Lowell made a lecture
tour in the west speaking at the Uni
versities and Colleges in Idaho,
Washington, Oregon and California.
Dr. Lowell has spent much of his
time at the Lowell Observatory and
has taken great interest in Flagstaff
and its progress.
He was married June 11, 1908, to
Constance Savage Keith of Boston.
Dr. Lowell returned to Flagstaff
Oct 19th apparently in his usual
health. On the mornnig of Nov. 12
he was seized with apoplexy and
passed away without regaining con
sciousness at 9:55 that evening.
The funeral services will be held in
Flagstaff at the Episcopal church

NEW CANALS ON MARS
(New York Herald.)
.Boston Following a course of lec
tures in Washington, Oregon and Cal
ifornia, in which he described the lat
est discoveries at the Lowell observa
tory, in Flagstaff, Arizona, Professor
Percival Lowell returned today to
take up his lecture work at Harvard
university.
Professor Lowell spoke of a fact
that has been little mentioned, that
the southern winter of Mars is much
longer and colder than the northern
winter on that planet, being fully six
months in duration.
Another interesting point brought
out was the discovery by the observ
ers at Plagstaff several years ago of
two new canals on Mars. These ca
nals were found on ono of the best
known parts of. the planet, near the
eastern limb, and had not been in ex
istence six weeks before.
That did not mean, according to
Professor Lowell, that the gigantic
canals were contsructed in that time,
since it is not the canals themselves
that we see, but the vegetation which
comes from them. It probably means,
hosfassertcd, that the canals were in
course of construction or had been in
use for many years, and water had
been turned into them, causing vege
tation to spring up a thing which
would have been possible in six
weeks.
In his address on the "Far Horizon
of Science." Professor Lowell gave his
hearers the history and peculiarities
of tho various plants. He described
Neptune as a planet still in its baby
hood, and said: "He is, in fact, such
a chaos that w ere we to set a foot on
himwc should sink at once thousand
of miles out of sight."
Uranus, the next planet in the evo
lutionary scale, has a day. Tho
knowledge of that fact was character
ized by Professor LowclJ as(the most
important recent discovery on the
planet. As an astronomer said, tho
fact that Uranus has a day docs not
make a great deal of difference to the
planet, as it is covered by such a thick
canopy of cloud that very little sun
light could pass through.
About Saturn a great deal has been
discovered recently, according to Pro
fessor Lowell. Of the facts the most
important is the fact that the whole
face of the planet, more than 75,000
thousand miles in diameter, has been
notably altered in the last year. That
has been done Jby volcanic eruptions
whereby some of tho interior layers
have boiled up and spread over the
outer layers. Another important dis
covery about Saturn is that it does
not spin as a unit, but in several
pieces, the inner layers traveling fast
er than the outer layers.
In treating of the earth Professor
Lowell said: "From a cosmic point of
view the earth has by no means pass
ed its zenith of development, let alone
the full attainment of its powers."
Invents a Dry Ground Boat
Guy Sykes has invented a sail boat
on wheels which he is demonstrating
on the paved streets these windy days.
While we are not much on nautical
terms, the .new creation looks like a
cross between an airship and a catboat,
with some few leanings toward an ice
clipper. The Sykes family are noted
for their mechanical genious and when
they are not inventing something
they are thinking of something to in
vent DeKoven Number Pleases
The DeKoven male quartette, the
third number of the Normal school
lecture course, was greeted by a large
audience last night at the Orpheum
theatre. Their entertainment was one
of the best quartette numbers ever
offered in Flagstaff and all who at
tended are hoping for their return at
some future date.
CAMPBELL STILL LEADS
IS
SUPERIOR COURT JURY
CONVENES MONDAY
The November jury term of court
was convened Monday with Judge
Perkins presiding. There was a long
list of summoned jury men who pled
their tale of woe before Judge Per
kins, showing why they should not be
compelled to serve their country at
this particular time because of other
business.
The trial of WUliam Fey, George
Mognettc an,d Arthur Blower, charged
with having killed an unbranded calf
on the range last April, was the first
trial up, and probably the only jury
trial that will be called. A jury com
posed of William Borum, Wilmer
Gum, Price Brinkerhoff, Ernest Lang,
A. S. Ruth, W. W. Hudgings, H. Van
derventcr, Robert Coffee and Emmit
Ennis was empaneled to hear the case.
Robert Morrison of Prescott, appear
ed for the, defendants and Judge Bar
num of the state live stock board and
County Attorney Wilson for the state.
After deliberating for about 18
hours, tho" jury acquitted Arthur
Blower and disagreed on Pey and
Mpgnette. The case was continued.
DEVELOPMENT WORK FOR
WHITE RESUMES MOVING
Robt Mitchell, general manager of
the Navajo Copper Co., operating the
White Mesa copper mines, reports
that he will soon have a three and a
half ton truck and two seventy-five
horse power "paterpiller" tractors
here to commence the hauling of ore
from their "quary."
Experts reporting on the property
say that th'crc is in the neighborhood
of a million ton of the copper ore run
ning fully tfn per cent in value lay
ing on tho top of the ground, making
it practically a quarrying proposi
tion. Copper nuggets can be found
in the sand and gravel scattered all
over the properties. What lies be
neath the great showing on top of
the ground has not been tested out as
yet, but there is every evidence that
there is a vast body of it that will
run richer as it goes down.
The tractors and trucks will not ar
rive for a week or ten days, having
been shipped last week by freight.
The tractors will carry a load of forty
ton over the sand at a speed of four
or five miles an hour; the other trucks
will make speed -after the ore is taken
across the burning sands.
There are only two or three owners
of the option, men who have the
means of handling and proving up the
property, and they have organized a
company for $200,000, with no stock
for sale. There is evidence in this
that it is purely a minipg proposition
and that the men behind it believe
that it. is going to be one of the big
producers of the country as soon as
they get things going.
RAPE CHARGE DISMISSED
FOR WANT OF EVIDENCE
The cases of the State of Arizona
against George Marshall, Tom Pres
ton, and Frank Rubean were dis
missed in the Superior Court Monday.
The defendants were arraingned,
plead not guilty, and demanded im
mediate trial. These cases were dis
missed by reason of the fact that
there was practically no evidence of
the guilt of the defendants without the
testimony of the principal witness,
Vieva Walker. She having been in
sane at the time the offense was com
mitted, and subsequently declared in
sane byx the order of the Superior
Court, it was impossible to use her
as a witness. And Dr. Kingsley,
Superintendent of the Insane Asylum
at Phoenix, advised that her condition
was permanent, and that he could not
make the necessary affidavit for a
continance until the next session of
tho court. Inasmuch as the statute
provides that the Uefendants be tried
at the first session of court after in
formation was filed, unless good cause
is shown for a continuance, it became
necessary, in view of the permanent
incapacity of Vieva Walker, to dis
miss the case of record.
Should the prosecuting witness be
come sane and be released from the
asylum before the statute of limita
tions runs (that is, five years), they
can be, rearrested and tried for this
offense.
UNDOUBTEDLY NEXT GOVERNOR
( Latest reports show that Campbell
has been elected governor of Arizona
by about 175 votes. The vote is so
close that it will be necessary for the
, official count next Monday to definite
ly determine his election.
The 'official count merely means a
checking of the tally lists as turned
in by the election boards of the dif
ferent precincts; there may be a few
errors here and there over the state
but not enough to change the results
as it has been tabulated by the repub
lican state central committee.
If a contest is filled, it will then be
necessary to open the sealed packages
containing the ballots as voted, and
recount them.
Campbell claims the election and
word has been sent out by the repub
lican state central committee to re
publican county central committeemen
to watch for any evidence of mani
pulation, believing there will be an
attempt to tamper with the returns
in-some precincts.

FLAGSTAFF REAiTeSTATE
MOVING AT GOOD PRICES
J. N. Bozeman purchased the thirty
five feet of ground on tho corner of
Agassiz and Aspen avenue of A. W.
Bikkcr at a good substantial price. It
is understood that Mr. Bozeman, will
commence the construction of a two
story rooming house with all modern
conveniences and a good sized lobby
on the first floor.
Fred Garing, the Flagstaff Dairy
man, has purchased the Colcord pro-
perty on Milton Road, and expects to
maintain his bottling plant there,
bringing his milk into Flagstaff in
large cans from his dairy at Dry
Lake. This will obviate many of
his troubles especially during the win
ter months and save a lot of breakage
over rough roads.
John Henncssy has purchased the -John
Clark residence property on Le-
roux street, which included the Alme-'
da hotel. The price paid was not
given.
MANY STATE FAIR VISITORS
Flagstaff certainly furnished her
quota of state fair visitors this week,
among them were: Dr. R. Hi H. -Biome,
