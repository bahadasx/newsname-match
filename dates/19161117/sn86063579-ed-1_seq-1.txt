Santa Fe, Nov. IS. The resolution
to submit the question of state-wido
prohibition to the voter next year
will be the first to be introduced at
the legislative session, if present
pluns are successful.
Prohibitionists feel that the pledge
of both parties to submit the question
will be kept, especially since E. C. de
Buca, oloctod governor, is a pro
nounced prohibitionist, us is also W.
E. Lindsey, who as lieutenant gov
ernor will preside over the state sen
ate and will' act as governor when
ever E. C. de Baoa is out of the state.
In fact prohibitionists declare that
they threw sever Ithousand Votes to
both men and elected them because
of their unequivocal stand for pro
hibition. They assert further that
it was this factor which re-elected
Chief Justice Clarence J. Roberts
and J.' II. Wagner, superintendent of
publio instruction. The fact that
Antonio Lucero ran so far ahead of
his tieket is ascribed to the same in
fluence as is the race that Attorney
Patton, practically, unknown, young
and inexperienced, gave such a pop
ular veteran as Frank W. Clancy for
the attorney-generalship.
Whenever a pronounceu prohibi
tionist ran against a non-prohibi
tionist on the same ticket, the form
i-r won. At the same time the prohibi
tion met ion is submitted to the vot
era, the women's suffrage amend
ment to the constitution will also be
submitted but because of the diffi
culty of amending the franchise sec
tion of the state constitution will
hardly succeed at the polls.
Election Bet Paid by Banquet
During the heat of the campaign,
Herman Rosch, Clyde Meyer, David
Hoffman and J. E. Ooodwyn, Repub-
icans, made a wager with Gordon
jiniflinm, Earl Cicotto, Hugh Burr
and II. C. Carter, Democrats, that in
nse of the election of Hughes or
Wilson one party should give a six
corn se banquet at the Harvey Hpiit-
n the other. The night of election,
the Denis thought they were stuck, but
as the returns came in things were
different, the Repubs owning defeat
and inviting the Hems to feed tonight
with Mrs. Harvey, good honest Re
publican cash paying the bill.
A wagon ride about the town was in
the first plans, but the Dems. craw
fished. Henry Raithel will be cbaperone.
Physical Training tii School
Doming is very fortunate this year
in having Mix White, our musio and
drawing instructor, one who ia pro

something in which we have hereto

The splendid work she is doing for
the young ladies is of great benefit
to all who avail themselves of the

FARKZRf KUCH INTERESTED
Kilobits Valley Can Have a Factory
as Soon as a Sufficient Acreage
Is Assured by the Farmers
Sugar beets are sure mortgage
lifter, if the opinion of those who
came from all beet-growing states to
the recent irigation congress at El
Paso is of any value. There was not
one man in tho bunch who didn't have
a good word to say tiliout sugar
beets, and the benefit they luul been
to each particular region.
If the Mimbres A alley is ever to
come into its own, we have got to
rnixc crop that will bring ynnU right
off the rei-l, and bring it every year.
The labor problt m ix also one of
great iniHrtiince, mid which is ab
solutely settled when it comes to
raising sugar heet.-i.
The factory always fiirniHlies lab
or and plenty of it nt low ctrnt to the
farmer, and tho only machines hoc
ornery in the cultivation of beets
would only cost a few dollars. One
man can take care of ten to twenty
acres, except thinning and weeding
and when it comes to soil liettermeut
there is no cultivation more liciicflciiil.
In speaking of the hencflN of sug
ar beets to a country, W. B. Mnndc-
ville, who secured the million dollar
factory for Las f races, ways: .
"Now to show you .jiwt a little bit
what a sugar tart industry does for
a country. In the year 1000 the first
siignr beet factory was loented at
Rockv Ford, 4'oloi'ddo. At Hint time
4500 acres were signed up. Today in
the Arkansas valley there are 45,000
acres of sugar beets and there arc
five factories there to extract that
sugar. Now if that had not been a
paying process to the farmer .. you
know they would not rnie sugar
liecl. At that lime I lie compnliy
contrncts rend fop five yearn, and to
day, the sugar heel company has only
asked for a emit met of one year. In
the state of Colorado there has been
in the years of 11)13 and 1010, six
million tons of sugar beets used,
which is nn average of two million
tons a year, and those sugar factor
ies have paid out for beets and for
Inboi a little belter Hum il 7,000,0110
ler year. Xow if you enn establish
nil ii'diiHlry in a community that
pay like that, you know llmt it enn
not but help, and I say without fear
of contradiction that the beet industry
for this valley is second in import-'
mice onlv to tho Flephiint Butte dam
that stands at Hie head of he valley.
There is no one thing that we could
bringMiito the valley thot would be as
good for all the people concerned n
the beet sugnr industry." There is no
one thing you enn put your land into
and be as absolutely sure of getting
profit from raising as from sngai
beets. In the Arkansas valley in
Colorado, you can ride nnioinr the
fanners and ask them out of what
crop they figure they get the best
profits, year in and year out, nad ev-
eryi farmer will tell yon it the sug
ar liccts.'" There is nothing, eentle-
men. that we can do that will bring
us beneflt--ihere is nothing yon can
do for yourselves that will produce
as much for you there is nothing
that you can put yonr land into that
will produce as much for yon."
Mrs. J. W. Weseott, who lives four
miles east of Deminir, brought he
Graphic two common table lieets, the
combined weight of which was 33i
lbs. The total circumference of the
two was R5 inches, and they were
grown without especial care or culti
vation. If common beeU will do that,
what will sugar beets do T Think of
it.

Demlng Will Be There
The federal farm loan board wants
to talk to the farmers of Kew Mex
ico when it holds its hearing in the
Albuquerque federal building next
Monday, November 20, according to
Frank R. Wilson, advance man for
the bourd, who arrived yesterday to
'omplctc nrnngements for the bear
ing, says the Albuquerque Morning
Journal.
"The farm loan act was adopted
for the licuctit of the farmer," said
Mr. Wilson, "mid the board ia anx
ions to apply this legislation so as
best to serve the farmers. For that
reason it wants the farmers of New
Mexico to attend this hearing and tell
the board first hand, their farm loan
needs, mill to listen to the explana
tion of the act by the members of
the board which will administer it."
Mr. Wilson announced positively
that Secretary McAdoo will attend
the Albuquerque meeting, as will the
oi her members of the board includ
ing George W. Xorris, Herbert Quick,
t'npt. W. S. A. Smith and Charles
K. Lobdell.
The lx.nril will arrive in Albuquer
que on the morning of November 20,
ns it is on its last lap of its 25,000
mile tour of investigation about the
f ii nn needs of various sections. Dur
ing December it will digest this great
mum of testimony and outline the
twelve "imnk districts. The hanks
will Ih established in January and it
is Iiiimi1 that they will be ready to
lend money for agricultural purpose
in February.
Mr. Wilson met with the Albnquer-
niie Chamber of Commerce commit-
Ii ml approved its arrangements
for ui'llinv this section of the state
properly represented at the Albnqner-
iie hearing.
"The farm loan act has met with
i wonderful response all over the
country, said Mr. Wilson, "ine
Kiiiuli n nil west have been particularly
impressive in organizing to take ad-
viiiilnue of it.' Nntnrally the sections
which suffered from a curtailed cred-
it will lie the first to grasp new op
portunities provided under this net."
"Tlii- ifovernment will estiiblish TJ.
federal land banks, each with a capi
tal of 1750,000,'' explained the visit
or, "and the government itself will
.ulivribe the original capital of
hese banks. Farmers, to borrow K
from these banks, are required to
roup themselves into national farm
lonn associations, probably one for
each community. These associations
must have ten or more members,
made up of formers or prospective
fnrmers who want to borrow. These
urmips borrow in bulk from the
Imnks.
"The organization of these groups
is required iu oredr to provide the
ninchinery for governing the banks,
for the valuation of lands, for the
crcntion of local responsibility add
for the elimination of worthless ac
counts. "The local asociations of borrow
ers are the foundation stones of the
whole system and through them the
system is made purely co-operative,
and through them its ownership and
control are kept in the hands of the
fercicrs themselves.
"Farmers are permitted to borrow
up to 50 per cent of the value of the
load and, 20 per cent of the value of
the improvements, and if a tenant de
sires to purchase land, he may get
the f0 per rent possible under this act
and then he may give a second mort
gage to the original owner for the
difference. So it is expected that
this act will enable many tenant to
become land owners.
"After the original capital of these
banks is loaned, the banks will get
additional money for lending though
the sale of their bonds, thus will
it ba seen that this farm loan bank
ing system is a big cooperative ma
chine, which collects the savings of

The election of Tom Campbell, re

Fiffures compiled by the Gazette from
the official returns of nine counties,
unofficial returns from three and with
final returns from Mojnve and Gila
counties estimated, give Campbell n
plurality of 162 over Hunt.
Editorially the Gazette concedes
