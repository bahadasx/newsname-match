AN UNUSUAL SUIT
ATTRACTING MUCH ATTENTION
IN CIRCUIT COURT
Jones Anderson Asking $15,000
Damages From Mrs. Fisher Her
ing, For Alleged Slander
One of the most unusual cases
which has been tried in the Lincoln
circuit court in years was in progress
Friday at the time the I. J. closed its
report for today's paper. It is the
$15,000 damage suit of Jones L. An
derson, a Preachersville farmer and
storekeeper against his first cousin,
Mrs. Fisher Herring, for alleged
slander. Mr. Anderson charges that
Mrs. Herring called him a "Gd--thief"
and used other epithets to him
when he happened to meet her at
the stores at Preachersville on Aug
ust 28th last. A great deal of inter
est is being aroused in the case, and
everyone from that section of this
and Garrard counties who can be
present, is on hand listening to the
proceedings. The jury which is try
ing the case is composed of Messrs.
W.M. Myers, Gus Geiszl, J. A. Wal-

Ray Sprinkles, aged 10, said he
heard Mrs. Herring call Mr. Ander
son a "thief" and a "s o b ."'
Neither of these children was cross
examined. This closed the case in
chief for the plaintiff.
Mrs. Herring On The Stand
Mrs. Herring took the stand. She
said her father and Mr. Anderson's
father were brothers; and that she
had known him from infancy. She
owns a farm about 220 acres in the
Preachersville section; her father
left it to her. Jones Anderson lived
on the farm for 10 years, renting it
from her. In 1908 he gave the place
up. She said she was looking over the
place soon afterwards and noticed
that a large amount of dressed rock,
which had been part of a foundation
and a chimney was missing. She had j
given no one permission to take it. i
Anderson was then living at .Preach
ersville. She was informed that he
had taken the rock. Considerable ob
jection was made by attorneys for
the plaintiff over the rock matter;
and much testimony concerning it
was not allowed to go to the jury.
She said that at that time Anderson
was threatening her with a law suit;
that he had left her place in an un
friendly spirit and had quit speaking
to her. She said that he conducted
himself toward her in a most insult
Col. Elkin To Speak
Is Maccabees' State Commander And
Former Stanford Resident
Maccabees and their friends are in
terested in the open meeting to be
held at the courthouse tonight, when
the principal address of the evening
will be delivered by Col. M. F. Elkin,
State Commander of the Maccabees
and a former citizen of Stanford. Col.
Elkin is one of the most eloquent pub
lic speakers in the state and undoubt
edly a large number of his friends
will turn out to hear him. The corn-
son, W. M. Murphy, C. Mobley, Ben
Lewis and J. W. Cocking. Attorneys
P. M. McRoberts, of Stanford and L.
L. Walker, of Lancaster, are repres
enting Mr. Anderson, with Attorneys
K. S. Alcorn, of Stanford and J. E.
Robinson, of Lancaster, for Mrs. Her
ring. In his statement to the jury At
torney Robinson plead mitigating
circumstances and justification for
the epithets Mrs. Herring used to
ward Mr. Anderson, which she ad
mits to using; and he also said that
they would show that his character
had not been damaged in the slight
est. Mr. Robinson characterized An
derson as a "Suer from Suersville'
in his remarks.
Mr. Anderson was the first wit
ness placed on the stand. He said
that he and Fado Parks were prepar
ing to go to Lancaster court when he
saw Mrs. Herring and her husband
drive up, but he paid little or no at
tention to them, until he heard Mrs.
Herring addressing him, using these
words: " i&
"Jones Anderson: I'm talking to
- r TV J-l t C n M A
you. iou are a ta u unci, uu
I can prove it by everybody in the
county. You have stolen enough
from me to send you to the peniten
tiary and I can prove it by Uncle
John Anderson." Mr. Anderson said
he went into his store, and when he
came out again she continued to ad
dress him, saying: ."All you have
got you stole from me. You are a
d coward. Why don't you talk?
NoV k and sue me". vou haven,t R?'
money enough to bring a suit." Lit
tle 12-year-old William Elmore com
ing up and Mr. Anderson said some
thing to him, he says Mrs. Herring
continued: "Now talk to these lit
tle scoundrels and the white trash of
Preachersville. Now go in there, you
in the eye and then turn his face away
with a smirk or snarl; it he should
happen to be in a group of men when
she came near he would look at her
and laugh and conduct himself in such
a way that the men would all look at
her, and this made her feel ridicu
lous and humiliated her greatly.
Judge Hardin sustained objectionto
introduction of evidence regarding
Anderson's threats to sue her over
a lawn mower about two years be
fore. Coming down to the offense com
plained of, she said that she drove
to Preachersville -rith her husband,
to buv some things for lunch; that
her husband then took the buggy and
went on to Lancaster, while she start
ed walking back home. When she was
in front of Cummins' store she saw
from Mr. Anderson's manner that he
was trying to annoy her, she testifi
ed. She said his manner of looking at
her was an insult: she turned her
huggy around so that she could not
see him; and when she started home
she forgot some things she came for,
because of her annoyance at Ander
son's action. She said-:
"He looked at me in a contemptu
ous way, turned on his heel; with his
head up in the air with a kind of
strut, and went up the pike humming
and singing."
Mrs. Herring said that she said
"There's entirely too much music
here to suit me." She said that she
had meant when she spoke to Parks
about Mr. Thornton that all winter
when Mr. Thornton was there she
could "go to the store and attend to

my business without being disturbed ! ed to the stand. She stated that she
by Jones Anderson." She said that
Mr. Anderson testified that he did
not sav a word to Mrs. Herring dur
ing her talk to him, and did not once
reply to her. He said that his back
wastfird her when he first heard
her t!il!;iiig. He said that such talk
hod a bad effect on his feelings, and
-flint wVifii he irot to Lancaster people
began talking to him about it and J
asking him about it, ana saying to
him that they didn't know before
that he was a "G d thief," all of
which humiliated him, and as he said,
"Of course, made a fellow feel pret
ty bad." He said the children at
school would ask his little daughtei
about it, too. -
Upop cross examination, he said
that he and Mrs. Herring had not
sooken for years. He admitted that
when Mrs. "Herring was talking to
him. he asked little William Elmore
if he had heard her. He said he then
-went into his store and wrote down
what she had said. He denied that
he had told the boy to "watch me
get $10.00 from her." He said that,
when he went to Lancaster a little
later, he went to Judge Walker's of
fice and talked to him about the mat
ter of a suit, but nothing was decid
ed at that time.
Fado Parks, who was present, and
preparing to go to Lancaster with
Mr. Anderson, said when she first
came to where they were, Mrs. Her
ring said to him: "Fado, I'm sorry
Mr. Thornton went out of the store.'
Mr. Parks said he asked her why and
iVv " she said "To keep things from danc-
' ing and singing across the street in
front of me." Mr. Parks then said
that Mrs. Herring then addressed
Mr. Anderson as follows:
"Jones Anderson, I'm talking to
vou, you dirtv little coward. I wan
you to stay off the road when I'm on
it." Parks said that Anderson then
went into his store, and she said:
"You G D thief; you stole
enough from me to put you in the
penitentiary for life and I can prove
it bv Uncle John Anderson.'
Mr. Parks said that he didn't see
Anderson doing any singing or danc
ing; that he never said anything to
her; nor did anything to her. Parks
said that while Mrs. Herring was
talking she was "jumping up and
down and slapping her fists" part
of the time. He said on cross ex
amination, that he and Anderson
went to Judge Walker's office on
some other business when they went
lf to Lancaster: that he had heard a
good deal of talk about it on the
streets of Lancaster. Asked if he re
membered about a lawn mower about
which Anderson was alleged by the
defense to have threatened to sue
Mrs. Herring a year or so ago. Parks
said he could recall nothing about it.
He said that he was friendly toward
both sides of this controversy.
Verna Sprinkles, aged 14, testified
she heard Mrs. Herring call Mr. An
derson a "thief and a rascal;" and
that "if he didn't know it everybody
else did." She said Mr. Anderson
did not reply to Mrs. Herring.
she told Anderson as he went into the
store that "I expected him to let me
attend to my business in peace." She
said that the language she used to
ward Anderson was "You are a con
temptible coward and a scoundrel"
and she said "I told him to go in his
store and not annoy me; to think I
have to take the insults of a rascal
like you." She said that he would
snap his fingers at Pai'ks; she swore
that she did not call him a G D
thief; not using such nor did she call
him a "s-ob." She denied most em
phatically that she had used any such
language. She said that it had been
hard to take insults from Anderson
as long as she had; that he had gotten
everything he had off her place. She
admitted to calling him a "thief" and
explained that in doing so she had re
ferred to the fact that she believed
he had taken the rock off her place
to which he had no right. Mrs. Her
ring said that before she had rented
the place to some one else, Anderson
had told her that she had injured
his little daughter $10,000. She said
that he had lost a race for school
trustee in that district and that
seemed to be hurting him consider
ably. She said she did not jump up
and down and slap her hands to
eether while she was talking to him
at Preachersville, for she had a loaf
of bread and other articles in her
arms.
On cross examination, she said that
she supposed she was there talking
to Anderson about 10 minutes. At
torney McRoberts then pulled out his
watch and told her to go ahead and
repeat over to him and the court just
what she had told Anderson. Mrs.
Herring did so, but it occupied only
four minutes, Mr. McRoberts said.
Quite a number of watches were out
timing her recital also, and this caus
ed some merriment in 'the courtroom.
Mrs. Herring admitted to have been
"very angry" and said she probably
repeated some of the things she said.
She said she did not call Anderson a
"darn coward," but used the expres
sion "durn coward," and at no time,
put the name of "God" before it or
any of her remarks. She said she did
not mind Anderson being on the roau
if he could act as a gentleman. She
said she couldn't tell Mr. McRoberts
what song he was singing or hum
ming; but that "his manner express
ed more insult than words could
have; his back was offensive; I hated
his manner; not him; no, indeed, I
didn't hate him; only his manner at
times; in the way he'd try to insult
me." Asked just what lorm nis "in
sults" took, she said: "The fact that
he'd walk up the pike in a manner
very offensive to any woman; he
would look at me and turn up his nose
with a sort of smirk, which was more
offensive than words ."
Mrs. Herring answered all ques
tions in a quiet and well modulated
voice; did not become excited and
seemed poised and self possessed at
all times. Court adjourned for the
day after her testimony was concluded.
Friday's Session.
was in her husband's store and heard
Mrs. Herring telling Mr. Anderson
what he should and shouldn't do, and
for him to stay out of her way. She
also stated that Mrs. Herring called
Anderson a "darn coward, and i-as-cal,
and a thiei" but used no curse
words.
Wm. Dvehouse was next called.
and stated that he heard very little
of the conversation between the two
parties. He said that Mrs. Herrinc
called Anderson a "dirtv coward."
The witness heard Mrs. Herring tell
Anderson he "got his start on her
farm: dared him to sue her. Witness
stated Anderson v&s doing and say
ing nothing unusual.
Bland Ballard stated that Ander
son's reputation is more bad than
good.
Leslie Anderson, colored, said he
worked for Jones Anderson in 1906
and hauled rock for him from an old
cabin on Mrs. Herring's farm. He
used two teams for four or five days.
George Brown said he saw teams
hauling rock from old chimney, but
did not know whose team thev were.
Said that the visible part of founda
tion of Jones Anderson's house is
brick.
W. C. Cummins stated that he
worked on Anderson's house and
said he used rock in under founda
tions, and small stone pillars and
dressed stone. Said that the rock
was hauled by Jones' team and Les
Anderson; said that the rock was
worth $2 a load. On being ques
tioned Mr. Cummins stated that An
derson's reputation was bad, and
stated that he could not get along
with Jones, due to some family trou
ble. Witness said that Jones put
his note out for collection and mis
treated his wife, Cummins' sistei.
John Morgan, colored, when call
ed, stated that he lived on the Her
ring farm in 1906; said some rock
were hauled from old chimney to
Jones Anderson's house and some of
it was hauled to Anderson's barn on
the Herring farm.
Jim Anderson, colored, said he saw
teams hauling rock, and Anderson
told him he wanted to "build a town
out of them."
John Cress said Jones Anderson
rerutation for truth and veracity is
bad. Jim Thompson, Sam Ramsey,
and Tom Ballard made same state
ment. Riley Dishon said that Anderson's
reputation for truth and veracity
is bad and that Anderson is dishon

The Interior Journal is authorized
today to announce M. S. Baughman,
as a candidate for the Democratic
nomination for sheriff of Lincoln
county subject to the primary in
August, 1917. This announcement
will be received with pleasure by Mr.
Baughman's friends in all sections of.
the county, and it is expected that
they will at once get busy in his be
half, and see that their friends and
neighbors understand the importance
of electing a man of Baughman's
type to the office of sheriff for the
next four years.
It was only upon the earnest solic
itation of many of his friends that
Mr. Baughman decided to again be
come a candidate. Petitions have been
presented to him, signed by over 400
prominent democrats and citizens of
all sections of the county urging him
to make the race, and pledging him
the strongest support that any candi
date for an office ever had in Lincoln
county before. Friends of Mr. Baugh
man do not hestitate to say that when
he was in charge of the office, eight
years ago, which he is now asking to
be entrusted with again, he made the
best sheriff that Lincoln county ever
had. He was a terror of evil doers;
saw that the laws were enforced
without fear or favor, and was al
ways prompt and faithful in the per
formance of all duties connected with
the office.
Those who know Smith Baughman
" and there are few men in this
county who do not know him by his
fiist name know that if he is nomi
nated as the Democratic candidate,
he will be elected, and will perform
the duties of the office in the same
way that he did before, to the com
plete satisfaction of every law-abiding
citizen. Mr. Baughman will not
issue a formal card to the voters in
making his announcement, but he is
willing to stand upon his record as
sheriff before, upon his unswerving
demociacy and upon the loyalty of
his friends all over the county who
have insisted that he make this race.
