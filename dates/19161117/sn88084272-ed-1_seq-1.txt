E-vY LONDON. Comx. Nov. 17.
Capt. Koenlg, commander of the
German commerce submarine
Deutschland, expected today his craft
would be driving through the -waves
out into the Atlantic on the homeward
trip to Bremen. Instead, the jubma-
1 rine was laid up in dock, with mem-
bers of the crew laboring over a forge.

(result, to the Deutschland, of a.collls
I Ion between the submarine and one
of her two tugs early today. T2 miles
from port, in which thetug- T. A. Scott.
Jr., was sunk, and five of. her crew
! drowned. The only nfah rescued-fronT
, the tug was Capt. Fred Hinscb, of the
interned uerman liner Neckar.
Tne submarine had len port not long
after midnight for her dash into the
open sea. The tugs convoyed the sub-
I 'marine.

An eddy caused the accident, acconi
' Ing to Capt Harry Baker, of the tug
I Cassie. the other conToyer of the sub-
marine. The Cassie was traveling
) about half a mile astern of the
j Deutschland. while the Scott and the
I submarine were moving about abreast.
' The sea was calm. Capt. Baker said,
and conditions were normal. The Scott
carried her usual lights, but the
Deutschland "had only her headlight
and two sidelights.
The tide was running almost full and
when about seven miles west of Race
Rock they struck an eddy which twist

After the collision the submarine re

The dead:
Captain John Gurney.
William A. Caton, engineer
Edward tone, fireman.
' Clarence B. Davison, cook.
i Eugene Duzant. deckhand.
The collision, according to a member
of the Deutschland's crew, came "all in
a minute." The tug. he said, got in front
of the Deutschland. the distance being
i so slight between them that the sub
j mersible had no chance of averting the
j accident. Her nose struck the tug
near the stern, lifting it well out of
j the water and sending the Scott's nose
' under Almost immetlately afterward
the boiler of the tug exploded and
the vessel sank with all on board.
Only One Man Saved.
Capt. Fred Hlnsch. of the Neckar, who
was on the tug, grasped a guy rope and
was drawn down with the tug. When he
rose to the surface he managed to
grasp a life preserver which had been
thrown out by the Deutschland and
was taken on board the vessel, by
which he was brought back to New
London.
Company Expresses Regret,
Vice president Paul G. Hilken, of the
Eastern Forwarding company. Ameri
can agents for the undersea line, said
today that a statement would be Is
sued by the company, probably tonight,
as soon as it was in possession of full
information. He added:
'The drowning of the crew of the

it more keenly than the officials of
