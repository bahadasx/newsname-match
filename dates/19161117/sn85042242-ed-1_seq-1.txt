PREDICT BEST MEETING ,U~.
IN ASSOCIATION ANNALS
Probable Attendance Will Be 600
Greater than that of 1914
Sessions
Fargo, N. D., Nov. 16—"Bisinarck in
1917, 2,000 sttong," was the slogan
adopted this afternoon by the 'North
Dakota Education association in unan­
imously accepting the invitation of the
Capital City, tendered through its Com­
mercial club and presented by a solid
Capital City delegation.
While it had been generally taken
or granted that Bismarck would get
the big convention in 1917, Grand
Forks turned up at the eleventh hour
as a strong contender for the honor,
and the Capital City prevailed only
through the excellent work of its re­
presentatives, with the splendid assist­
ance of Supt.'C. L. Love of Mandan
aqd Supt. P. S. Berg of Dickinson.
Loyalty to the Slope was evidenced in
the voting, central and western North
Dakota standing solidly by the Capi­
tal City. Jamestown and Valley City
gave excellent. Support, and in the final
vote it was decidedly Bismarck.
The Folks Who Old It
The people really responsible for
bringing the convention to Bismarck
in 1917 are, in addlton to Supt a. Berg
and Love. W. E. Parsons, newlyelect
ed county superintendent of schools
for Burleigh oennty, now serving de­
puty state superintendent of public in
•traction, and re-elected tblsweefc NsfeJ
retary of the North' Dakota Education
association J. M. Ifaftin, superintend­
ent of the Bismarck public schools,
who attended a convention of the N. D.
B. A. for the first time, and proved
himself a power C. L. Vigness, county
superintendent of schools for Burleigh,
who presented the invitation from the
Bismarck Commercial club and backed
it up with a strong argument State
Superintendent of Public Instruction
E. J. Taylor, for the Capital City first,
last and always, and Miss Laura San­
derson, assistant state superintendent
of public instruction, who proved one
of the, most effective campaigners
among the ladies.
Much Advance Work Done.
Even though Bismarck anticipated
no competition, a large amount of ad­
vance work had been done by the Bis­
marck Commercial club, by individual
members of the association in the Cap­
ital City and through' the Slope coun­
try generally, and when the delegates
assembled here Wednesday it at once'
became apparent that Bupnjarcfc would
get the next meeting.
The 1914 convention held in Bis-.
marck, was the biggqsiC- meeting of the
association up to that time, and the
1917 convention is expected to ffnd
fully 2,000 delegates in attendance, 600
more than were present at the banner
session^ in the Capital City three years
ago.
Only Three\Can Handle It.
The North Dakota Educational asso­
ciation has become such a great organ­
ization that only North Dakota's three
foremost cities—Fargo, Grand Forks
and Bismarck—can now accommodate
its annual conventions. Grand Fork's
turn in 1918, unless in the meantime
Minot should so improve its hotel facil­
ities as to place the Magic City line
to succeed Bismarck.

|f|jChicago, Nov 16.—The life of the
United Stated navy is at stake in the

sistant Secretary of the Navy Roose­
velt asserted in a paper read tonight
•before the annual meeting here of
the American (Mining congress.
"it may be set down as a definite
conclusion," said, the speaker, "that
:the navy cannot reveil to coal burn­
ing vessels without enormous loss of

navy will not so revert."
The article Ts the navy depart­
ment's opening attack in the renewal
of the fight in congrelss' over the Phe

bill, designed to protect the claims of
California operators. Navy officials
have insisted that the policy of build­
ing oil burning: ships could not he car­
ried out if the amendment prevails,
and Secretary Daniels appealed di­
rectly to President Wilson when ac­
tion seemed imminent during the last,
session of congress.
Mr. RooseveltV paper declared that
oil fuel for the niivy meant increased
speed and cruising radiiis, control of
smoke for smoke screens, reduced
fire-room forces by 55 per cent, re­

sitting in the county court on charge
advanced by the state of attempting to
aid in rescuing Frank Gallagher of

the first probation system of the kind
in the country, is gi.ving workhouse
lirisoners a new deaf and saving the
wives and children of prisoners from
poverty and public charity while they
are serving sentences.
Sending a family man to the work­
house, under the old system, usually
meant his dependents suffered from
lack of food and shelter. They were
punished, though innocent, along with
the man.
Dr. Frank D. Garland, former minis­
ter, now head of the welfare depart­
ment, originated this new plan and is
establishing a correctional farm where
prisoners may work and live in the
open air and sunshine instead of be­
ing cooped up in unwholesome quar­
ters.
Under the new plan a man under
sentence to the workhouse may spend
only the nights there. During the day
he works in some shop or factory mak­
ing a living for his family.
He comes and goes like the other

Amerioan Foreign Representatives
Expected to Quit When Wil
son Starts New Term
IDEA WAS INAUGURATED
BY THEODORE ROOSEVELT
Washington, Nov. ijp.—In accord­
ance with custom- in the diplomatic,
service, all American ambassadors
and ministers abroad are expected to
resign as a sequence to President Wil*
son's re-election and succession to a
new term of office.
Many of them were appointed orig­
inally without special knowledge on
their part of the peculiar requirement
of their posts. Some had no intention
of remaining abroad longer than one
term of four years. In other cases,
some who had expected to make even
shorter stays abroad, have been, from
force of circumstances, especially the
exigencies of the present war, to con­
tinue at their post only to meet the
wishes of the state department.
Foreign policies will engross a large
part of President Wilson's intention in
the. immediate future to an extent nev­
er contemplated when he first assum­
ed office.
Fortunately, the practice, which fyis
become general in the American' ser­
vice since Theodore Roosevelt frank­
ly requested the resignations of all
the ambassadors and ministers, will
afford President Wilson the necessary
opportunity to carry out plans he has
projected involving it very consider­
able reorganization for the diplomatic
service, so far as the heads are con
cerned.
