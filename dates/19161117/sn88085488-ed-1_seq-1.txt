Next May
i
Members of the order of Knights of
Pythias from different parts of Whit- ]
man county assembled in Pullman
Holiday evening for the annual con
vention of District No. 13, which com
prises 14 lodges. The meeting, while
to a large extent different from the
conventions of past years, was a suc
cess, | the round table discussion,
which supplanted the customary rank
work exemplification, bringing out in
a forceful way many points of vital
interest to the order and its mem
bers. The convention went on record
as favoring thtralodge team competi
tion as a means of boosting the at
tendance figures and .interest of each
subordinate lodge when it unani
mously adopted a resolution offered
by Supreme Representative R. C. Mc-
Croskey of Garfield. A copy of the
resolution will be forwarded to each
lodge in the district, with the re
quest of the convention that the plan j
be Inaugurated at once in an effort
to create a greater interest In the
work of the subordinate lodges by
their members.
The visitors were welcomed to
Pullman by D. C. Dow, a member of
the local lodge, whose remarks were
timely and forceful.
The round table discussion on
the question "What Can We Do to
Best Promote the Good of the Order
in This District," after being opened
by A. R. Metz of Colfax, grand vice
chancellor, and Judge Thos. Neill,
member of the judiciary committee,
was a lively one, and resulted in a
great amount of good. A large per
centage of the delegates took part in
the discussion and both sides of each
question proposed were fully con
sidered.
Interesting talks were given by-
Grand Vice Chancellor Met/; 11. M.
Love, grand K. of R. & S., and Judge
Thos. Neill. of Colfax; R. C. McCros
key, and Dr. C. 11. Bentley of Gar
field, and numerous others
The big "mulligan" made a decid
ed hit with the visitors and the recipe
by which the somewhat mysterious
but highly satisfying dish was con
cocted was eagerly sought.
During the banquet hour most ex
cellent music was furnished by the
"A. T. O." orchestra of the State
College.
The convention accepted the in
vitation of Colfax lodge, No. 4, to
meet at that place next May. the date
to be set by the officers. Grand Vice
Chancellor A. R. Metz was elected
President. Thos. Neill vice president
and Ellis Laird secretary and treas

WAGNER RESIGNS: *
CASH SAVED TO CITY
City Dads Decide One Marshal
Enough for Peaceable Pullman—
More Lights Promised
Business reversals are ordinarily
conditions to be deplored, but in the
case of the business of Pullman's po
lice force, which lias come to be al
most a negligible quantity, the condi
tion will result in a net saving to
the city of something near $100 per
month, representing the salary of
the day marshal. Chief of Police
George Wagner Tuesday evening pre
sented his resignation to the city
council, the efficient police officer
having gone to Montana to engage
In the live stock business. The res
ignation was accepted, but no suc
cessor was appointed, the city dads
having come to the conclusion that
the demoralized business of the po
lice department would warrant but
one peace officer. Consequently the
city attorney has been instructed to
prepare an ordinance combining the
office and duties of the water super
intendent, street commissioner and
day marshal. Following the adop
tion of the ordinance C. M. Hooper,
who has served the city efficiently in
the two former capacities, will have
placed upon his shoulders the ad.l.-d
responsibility of maintaining peace
and quiet during the daytime and
Night Marshal Harry Douglass will
be adorned with the insignia of chief
of police, serving, as at present,
nights.
A much better system of street
lighting in the residence districts
will result from the adoption by the
council of the report of the light,
committee, which recommended the
placing of tungstens in the center of
each block in the paved sections as
well as the present lights at the
street Intersections. The report al
so included recommendations for
placing three lights on the newly,
completed paving east from the con- 1
crete bridge on Spring street and
one additional light on East Main
street.
The assessment rolls for Improve
ment Districts. 27 and 32 were filed
and December 19 set as the date for
hearings on the two rolls.

Additional Units for Reserve
officers' Training Corps
Added honors came to the State
College corps of cadets when the war
department yesterday included the
local institution in a list of nine col
leges where units of the reserve of
ficers' training corps are to be estab
lished. Advice of Uncle Sam's ac
tion, which came last night, was re
ceived with delight, as it means free
uniforms and full equipment for
each of 700 cadets at the state school
as well as free transportation to and
from the four-weeks summer camps,
with all expenses while at the camp,
and $75 in cash per year to the ca
dets who drill during their Junior
and Senior years. The local institu
tion made application for the estab
lishment of the reserve corps here
some time ago, and when, four
months ago, the institution was in
cluded In the "distinguished" lis!
| following thorough inspection or the
batalllon, the ultimate selection of
the college for the establishment of
a training corps was anticipated.
The training corps are provided for
i under the national defense act, which
provides that junior divisions may be
established at all Institutions having
100 or more cadets, with senior
divisions at the larger universities.
One of the requirements is that the
cadets be given two years of drill,
! which makes all of the XV. S. C. ca
dets eligible for the free equipment

Saturday's count showed a total of
282 of the high priced table necessi
ties. Saturday's lay sold on the local
market for $ 11.98; the cost of toed I
was $6.10, leaving a net profit of
$5.88 from the 1118 pullets. Since
the first of November the lowest
day's egg sales were 18.60, and the
total sales, from October IS to No
vember 13 were $233.58,
Mrs. Whitaker presented figures to
Prove that under ordinary conditions
the average man or woman can real-'
ize a salary of $100 per month or
over, depending entirely upon the
skill of the taker, 10 per cent in
tores) on the investment and as much
'"", for incidental expenses, with
1200 pullets. Walter Hogan, the ex
pert lay predictor, estimated the ay- .
erage la) Of th.' pullets in the all
Northwest contest at. 163 for the year.
Reducing this estimate to 150 for fig
ure convenience and applying It to a
flock of 1200 pullets, costing a maxi
mum of $1 each, the annual egg sales
of the flock would aggregate $4500.
At the close of the year the birds
would 1 ring a minimum of 30 cents
each ii sold for table purposes, add
ing a minimum of $360 more- to the'
Income totals, or an aggregate of
$4860 in receipts.
At $1 each at ihe beginning of the
) i i.i the 1200 birds would represent
an outlay -of $1200. A salary of $100
per month would make' $.1200 more
and the feed, figuring at $1.80 for
each bird for the year, would cost
$2160. Alts. Whitaker estimated
the ...si of housing for the birds at
$2 each, or an investment of 100
for houses, Charging each bird 10
per cent lor "house -rent." the- total
expense for this purpose would reach
210, making a grand total of ex
penses of $4 800, and leaving $60 over
and above the stated salary for inci
dents Is or added salary.
Mrs. Whitaker was very conserva
tive in selecting her figures, and the

er and Olson also had cows making
records worthy of mention and which
place them in the honor roll for the
month.
The leading cow for the month is
a new one for the honor roll. Star,
a grade Hoistein, four years old,
take- the place with a production of
86.6 pounds of butter fat.
Only one of the cows In the roll
freshened In the spring, therefore it
will be interesting to note how many
of the fall cows will remain in the
list until next spring, but if last
year's performance is repeated there
should be a larger proportion, as the
| fall cows last year produced 26
pounds more butter fat than did the
cows freshening in the spring and
made an average profit of $8 more
per head. This indicates that fall
freshening is the more profitable and
that the cows In the association are
properly managed during the winter
months.— Meal C. Jamieson, Dairy
