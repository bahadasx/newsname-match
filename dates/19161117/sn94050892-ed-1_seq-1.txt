NUMBER 26.
HE
LATE STRIKE
HAS
BEEN AMICABLY
' , SETTLED
It looked for a time during the past
week as though this district would ex
perience a repetition of the troubles
of two years ago; but, fortunately
better council prevailed, and the mat
ter has been amicably settled by a
return of the miners and smelternen
to work on last Saturday morning.
The cause of the walk-out was the
discharge of a timbennan from one ot
the company's mines in Morencl.
Without eousultine officers of the
lncal union. 1 number of Mexican,
miners waited or the Superintendent '
and demanded the timberman s restor
ation to his job, with full pay for
loss of i.ime. during the lay-off.
This the company refused to comply
with, and the Mexican miners quit
In a body.
On Saturday at midnight five men
purporting to be a committee of the
union went to the smelter and by
ils representation of their authority
and without giving the management
a moments notice, caused all the
crafts to quit work.
On Monday last union officials Mc
Kinnon and Davenport arrived here
from Globe to get at the bottom of
the cause of the trouble and use their
good 01'iices in adjusting matters be
tween the company and the strikers.
Two m.'iFs meetings were held in
front of the postoffice one on Mon
day and one on Tuesday at which
speeches were made by McKinnon and
Davenport, followed by Mexican speak
-era.
In his address Mr. Davenport as
sured his audience that, the matter
would be amicably settled In a few
days,, or as soon as those In authority
In trie local union could, get at the
f'tcts, as up to that time the local
union officials claimed ignorance as
to who called the men out.
Aa soon as the Globe men got the
true suite of facts, they advised the
: strikers to return to work.
No disorder prevailed nor was there
at any time a semblance of desire by
any one to disturb the quiet of the
community.
Joseph Meyers, investigator of la
'bor for the Federal government, came
here to secure a 'permanent settle
ment Ul Llle SLi lne. XI met. wuu tuc;
officials of the local unions, and after
a thorough investigation, and consid
eration of the evidence adduced, it
was found that there was no real
grievance, that the strike was un
authorized, that the so-called griev
ance was not brought before the Com
imittee, at any time prior to the
strike.
Mr. Meyers states further that this
is the second time has visited
the district on behalf of the govern
ment, and he is tired of doing so at
government expense; when such mat
ters could be regulated by men in iu-
"thority in the local unions, by keeping
faith in their agreements . with the
-companies and by suppressing the few
agitators who keep the miners in - 'a
estate of turmoil.
It has been currently reported that
the companies In conjunction with Mr.
Myers, has made god the amount
claimed for loss of time of the timber
man who caused the trouble. This
"has been positively refuted by the
management and also by Mr. Meyers.
NEW MEXICO GIVES WILSON
A MAJORITY OF 3000.
With officially certified returns, the
result of the canvass in the coun
ties yesterday, beginning to come in
slowly, there is nothing to indicate
important modification of previous
estimates on the result of the New
Mexico election. The state has given
Wilson a majority of close to 3000
and elected a democratic senator,
governor, congressman and majority
of the state ticket by pluralities
ranging from 500 to 2000. The Re
publicans have certainly elected the
land commissioner, lieutenant gover
nor and supreme court justice and
state auditor. They have not con
ceded the attorney generalship to
the Democrats. The Democrats have
made gains of 11 in the- legislature
and will have 23 out of 49 members
of the house and 9 out of 24 sen
ators .
THE SANTA FE R .R.
- ATTACKS THE 8 HOUR LAW
A petition enjotninsr the "federal
district attorney and labor leaders'
from piittiner the Adamson eight-hour
bill into effect was filed in the federal
district court of Kansas City this
week in the name of the A. T. and
S. F. railway.
' The hill calls attention to agree
ments with train employees, none of
which, it says, contemplate that an
employee shall work a fixed number
of hours, but that owing to the na
ture of train service, the trip in num-
, ber of hours or mileage, as preferred
by the men, is the basis of compen
sation. The bill recites the circumstances
surrounding the Adamson law and
claims that it is a mere arbitrary in
crease in wages. The law, says the
bill. is unconstitutional and void be
cause it is not a regulation of inter
state commerce, that it is a mere ex
periment, that it deprives the com
pany of its liberty of contract and
right of property without due process
of law and that it is unworkable and
uncertain. '

John Erickson is a fugitive from
I justice and Mrs. Erickson is being
held by the local officers for examina
tion for insanity, as a result of fur-
ther investigation into the death of
P Alma Erickson, the stepdaughter of
John Erickson, who passed- away at
the Copper Queen Hospital some days
j ago .
It will be remembered that Dr. E.
I B . Walker was arrested by local au
thorities on the strength of a state
i ment made by the dying girl at the
hospital. It would appear that evi-
j dence has been secured which may
j clear the doctor and which' throws
jte entire blame on Erickson. The
i warrant against Erickson, now in the
1 hands of the officers, charges rape.
' The defendant has not been seen
j in the district since last Tuesday
1 morning at 5 (tj'clock . The sheriffs
' officers have s earched the entire
. community and have sent descrip
, tions of the man all over the South-;
west. So far no trace of him has
been found. . J
Dr. Walker, In the meantime, has
been released on $2500 bond, on the
charge of an illegal operation.
Though technically, the other two
charges, rape and murder, may stand
against him, his release was easily
obtained by his attorney when the
additional evidence was developed.
Sensational charges and counter
charges have been made in the case
and the sudden disappearance of
Erickson leads many to the belief
that there Is much in the case which
has not been told and which may
never be told.

CAMPBELL MEET
The old adage: "You can't make
a gold purse out of a pi-2'3 Leg," never
-.'.'as stronger exemplified than the in-o-rioit
of the refusal of Governor
li;:?! to repiy to a courteous remark
from Tom CanipbHl, when they met
for the first lime since the Open'ng
tit' fie r:nr-aizn. The meeting took
is! front of the Elk's Theatre
in Phoenix on last Saturday night.
The incident is described by the
Phoenix Republican as follows:
"Governor Hunt and Tom Campbell
met for the first time since the open
ing of the campaign last night, when
their paths crossed in front of the
Elks theatre, where each was enter
tained at a box party.
The governor stood. between Ho
mer Wood and Charles Robeits as
the Campbell party, including the
candidate's wife, and two sons arriv
ed in the lobby. Mr. Campbell
strode over and shook hands with
Mr. Wood. "Hello Homer," he
said. Turning to Mr. Roberts, he
said, "How do you do, senator?"
Then, as the governor remained si
lent, unmoving, Mr. Campbell grasped
his hand. "Good evening, Governor.
How are you standing the strain?"
As the governor did-jiot reply, Mr.
Campbell turned, bowed to the party
and escorted his wife into tfte'tt!fia
ter, where an ovation awaited him

ARIZONA DRY LAW
EFFECTIVE SOOH
New Amendment Receive Heavy j
Plurality; Prohibits Transportation
Phoenix, Ariz., Nov. 13. The Ari-;
zona Temperance Federation is advis- i
ed that the new prohibition amend-1
ment has been carried overwhelming-
ly and that the suggested local oj ;
tion measure has received a negative
vote. Many communities have given
a four-to-one vote for prohibition.
Phoenix, in which the amendment i
seems to have missed the attention of '
a majority of the voters, gave over j
two to one in favor of the new order. !
This act prohibits the transporta-;
tion of intoxicating liquors for any
purpose save for surgery and sacra
mental uses, and makes illegal the
possession of liquor that has been in
troduced unlawfully into the state.
This permits the possession of alcohol
that has been introduced before Jan
uary 1st next, but it is assumed that
the burden of proof will be laid upon
the defendant in any action under the
law. Only about six weeks remain
in which to introduce liquor lawfully,
and these six weeks are expected to
be a harvest time for dealers in El
Paso and Los Angeles, who already
are profiting largely by the shipment
of "personal use" into this state.
Several county attorneys have op
posed the new law as something that
will bring back a plague of bootleg
gers and aver that conditions in their
counties have not been so very bad
since the introduction of "personal
i use" was permitted.

MONTANA ELECTS A
WOMAN TO CONGRESS
For the first time in the history of
the United States a woman will oc
cupy a seat in the national legisla

the Montana Woman Suffrage Associ
ation, has been elected Representative
at large for Montana on the Republi
can ticket by at least 2000 majority.
Prominent suffrage leaders in the
country sent messages of congratu
lation to Miss Rankin, who said to
day: "I knew the women would stand by
me. I will not only have. to repre
sent the women of Montana but also
the women of the country, and I
have plenty of work cut out for me."
Miss Rankin defeated seven men in
the primaries by a plurality of 7000
votes more than her nearest male
contestant.
Miss Rankin's platform has just five
planks, which are: National woman
suffrage, child welfare, tariff revis
ion for the protection ot the worker,
prohibition for State and nation and
greater publicity in Congressional
committies.

LOCAL DEMOCRATS
CELEBRATE
VICTOR!
Republicans and Democrats of Cllt
ton, in unison, pulled off a stunt last
Saturday night that was unique in its
originality.
About 8 o'clock in the evening sv
eral hundred people assembled at the
hrlrifro with a voHfnla Alnhnratfilv Vt
decked with bunting; and after se
curing the persons of Mr. John C.
Gatti, and Mr. Peter Riley, placed
them in the decoratde car
riage with long lines- of rope attach
ed, with Roman candles shooting sky
ward, and proceeded by the Clifton
brass band, marched through the
streets to the tune of martial music
jand vociferous cheers for "Wilson,
! Campbell and Slaughter."
I After the parade through the town,
i the procession proceeded to the ten- -
nis court, and forming a circle around
, Champ Gatti and Riley, with red,
i white and blue fireworks illuminating
the court; danced and yelled with the
'enthusiasm of Apache Indians at a
war festival. j
I wnen some degree of order and
snence was restored speecnes were
demanded by the crowd. Mr. Gatti
made a brief address, the substance
of which was, that he and Ms party,
'made a good fight for the success of
the ticket, national, state and coun
ty, and like true Americans, were satis
fied with the result; yet he would not
concede the election of Wilson until
the final official count decided it in
favor of the democratic nominee. He
further said that he fought the demo
crats to the last ditch, and he would
be in the rhig four years hence to re
new the conflict. The "Old Champ"
dies hard, but he is no welcher, he's
a dead game looser. He called for
three cheers for Tom Campbell, they
were given with a vim, and the band
played "Hail to the Chief," and "Di-
