resentatives, to abandon hiH opposj

failed toduy. The other members of
the commission had not lost hope to
night and the. conference will be con
tinued, hut ther wan absent the note
of optimism which characterized the
close of the sessions yesterday,
lie Meets That's All.
Mr. Cabrera met with the commis
sion today for the first time since
Tuesday. The fact that ho had bit
terly opposed the agreement sanc
tioned Tuesday by Ignaclo Monlllas
and Alberto .1. I'niii. the other Mexican
representatives, and that while he
was out of the city yesterday Mr.
Bonillas and Mr. Tnni again offered
their support to the plan oau'ed pe
culiar Interest to be attached to his
reappearance In the eominisloti room
today. It was believed possible he
might yield to the importunities of his
colleagues and bring the discussion to
an amicable" close.
Before they left their room tonight
after a long session the commissioners
agreed that they would say nothing
regarding the day's tnlk.
It hecame known, however, that
virtually the entire day was spent In
argument calculated to convince Mr.
Cabrera of the advisability of endors
ing the plan and to make clear to
him the danger in which continued op
position might place his government.
Mr. Cabrera was ready with counter
suggestions which It is understood are
regarded by tho Americans as Impos
sible for them to accept.
All was ready for the formal agree
ment. There had been forwarded
from Washington a supply of the
sepclnl paper on which tieuties are
written and even the green, white and
red ribbon, the colors of Mexico, were
purchased today for binding the
sheets, but there appeared little pros
pect tonight of their early use.

Is the Opening Cuu in lov
erninent's Fight on the
I'hclan Amendment.
CHICAGO. Nov. 16. The life of
the I'nited States navy is at slake
in the fight to retain government con
trol of the California petroleum re
serves. Franklin Mooscvell, assistant
secretary ol the navy, asserted In a
paper read tonight betore the annual
meeting here of the American Mining
congress.
"It may be set down as a definite
conclusion." said the paper, "that the
navy cannot revert to coal burning
vi'sscls without enormous loss of ef
ficiency and furthermore that the
navy will not so revert."
The article is the navy department's
opening attack ill the renewal of the
right ill congress over the l'belau
anicnilment to the general oil laud
bill designed to protect the claims of
California opciators. Navy officials
have Insisted that the policy of build
ing oil burning ships could not be
carried out 11' the amendment pre
vailed and Secretary Daniels appealed
directly to President Wilson when
action seemed Imminent during (ho
last session of congress.
Would Oil Spi'i'd.
Mr. Moosevtit's paper declared that
oil fuel for the navy meant Increased
speed and e-ruislng radius, control of
smoke for smoke screens, reduced fire
room forces by fii per cent, Increased
the efficiency or refueling at aea 2f
per cent, meant ability to sustain
maximum speed tor long periods of
time without clogging furnaces, flex
ibility in speed and finally, greater
safety from submarines as in modern
Amerirun ships tho fuel oil Is disposed
along the button to cushion the blow
of exploding torpedoes.
The 35-knot battle cruisers, scouts
and destroyers authorized by congress
could not be built, the paper asserted,
if coal fuel was to be employed.
"It is estimated," the paper con
tinued, "that the navy should have
on hand in time of peace storage tanks
capable of holding a full two years'
supply for the fleet in war time. For
our present needs we should have
probably two million barrels so stored.
Ten years hence we ought to have
twenty million barrels.
Is Dig Demand.
"Oil men are much Inclined to
ridicule the idea that there can ever
be a shortage of oil for naval I Is.
They base this, perhaps, on lack of
knowledge of what our future needs
are to be. The navy burns today in
time of peace about Mii.oiM) barrels a
year. i in- e'onst ruet inn of ships al
ready ant liorized by congress will call
for all annual consumption of A.7JI,
(iiih barn-Is In 1H23."
If battleships me to be replaced
as planned after twenty yeais service
the paper stated the annual consump
tion would rise to lli,:',17 .000 barrels
in ten years.
Mr. Moosevelt said the navy was
content that every justifiable claim
against the reserved lands should be
compensated "but they must cease to
remove oil from these' lands."
There was no iiieslion, be said, that
a fair method of adjustment could be
found.
