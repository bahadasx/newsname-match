IMPROVEMENT FOR.
WARREN ROAD
To lie KeIrcssel ami Kollel for Win
lc Traffic
According to Judge Hattan, the
Wurren road, from near McNulty
creek brldgo through Warren and as
far as ScappooEO creek, will he given
temporary improvements at once.
Tho crusher is now being set up
and will turn out inch rock and
screenings which will be used for
filling the many small holes and re
dressing tho road, and it will alsc
bo rolled.
At present tho road is in bad
shape, and on account of its having
had no attention for scmo time is
if.pidly going to pieces. Tho county
ourt thinks that the temporary im
provement to he mado will keep it
in fairly good condition until next
jummer, when somo permanent work
will probably ho dono.
Tl.o roller which has hosn in use
in the Deer Island road has been
nought back to St. Helens, work on
hut stretch of ro:d being completed
for the timo being. A small gang of
men Is still employed doing miscel
laneous necessary work.
NO LONGER MAY
STOCK RUN AT LARGE
Sixty days from November 17 it
will be unlawful for stock to run at
largo In Columbia county. I!y tlu
;cant majority of 36 votes, the peo
ple of Columbia county have willed
that stock must bo kept in some in-
clcsure. Tho penalty for tho first
offense is $10, and $20 will l:e the '
flno for each subsequent offenso. In
the election returns the Mist gave
tho ma.'crity as two votes, but when
tho county clerk car.vassad the votes
ho found tho stock law had passed
by 36 majority. The difference in
-ho f.gu.es is on account of errors
made by several election hoard

-.tlerks. Remember, from now on i
keep your cattle tied up or in a
fenced pasture, else you will bo sub

':een attending a conference of offl
ials of Clatsop, Columbia and Mult

llko fund. Judge Hattan states that
during the next three year $800,000
will be contributed by the govern
ment with the idea of making per
manent roads. Senator Houston, of
Multnomah county, advocated the
doubling of the tnx on autoniobllo.3

bound for San Pedro and other Cali
fornin ports.
Capt. 11. T. Groves, who for the
past 18 years has been connected
with the port of Portland, will leave
thai service in the near future. In
tho interest of economy the commis
sion has abolished that office and the
manager will attend to the duties
formerly looked after by Captain
Groves. The captain is well known
'nd has many friends in St. Helens,
who wish him success on any enter
prise ho undertakes.
The steamer Coaster arrived in
Wednesday evening and Immediately

150,000 feet of lumber far California
delivery. She left down river early
Thursday morning.

LEGISLATURE ACTS
Attorney General Makes Killing to
This Kffet t.
Tho "hone dry" constitutional
amendment will not go into effect in
Oregon until the legislature acts, ac
cording to a ruling of Attorney Gen
eral Brown. Until the legislature
provides laws to go with the amend
ment, tho present law which permits
the importation of two quarts of
whisky or 24 quarts of beer every
four weeks will bo in effect. Mr.
Brown said tho issuing of a proclam
Jtion by the governor early in De
jember, declaring the result of the
election, would not affect the sltua-
l,on- The legislature will meet Janu-
ary 8, and it will probably take sev
eral days to enact a law providing
regulations and penalties to carry out
the amendment adopted.
WILL INVESTIGATE
COST OF PAPER
CJovernmeiit Trade Commission Will
IVobo Matter.
Investigation of the advance In
price of news print paper has been
started by tho government trade com
mission and a report will be rendered
?oon. The advance in news print
paper began early in 1916 end has,
continued to climb. The contract
price beforo tho beginning of the
raiso was about $2 per 100 pounds
at the factory, and now it Is hover
ing around tho $7 mark. The com
mission has found that tho average
cost of manufacture of news print
to bo less than $33 per ton, or $1.65
per cwt. Market pricas on somo of
tha materials used have been ad
vanced to quito nn extent, but not
so much so that the manufacturer
can demand $7 for what he formerly
sold for $2. The question applies
not only to the newspapers, but to
the whole public, since the cost of
wrapping paper, bags, paper nap
kins, etc., have gone up by leaps and
hounds. Everyono is willing to pay
ADJOURNED CITY
COUNCIL MEETING
PRUNING OF EXPENSES
Majority of Council Favor 12 Mills
to Cover F..Venso.s.
The city council, pursuant to an
adjournment Monday night, met
Tuesday afternoon. Several permi's
for repairing and constructing of
bulldingr, were granted.
An ordinance vacating certain
streets in Rose Hill addition was
lead tho first and second times.
A delegation from the Woman j
Club requested the council to mal.i
some appropriation towards the e:
penee of the city library. On motion
of Councilman Ballagh the council
voted to contribute $75 per year and
also furnish lights and wood for the
library room.
Claims against the city for lights,
labor, etc., were taken up and after
investigation were allowed.
As to the rate of assessment to
cover city expenses for the coming
year, a majority of the council
thought 12 mills would cover the
expenses, and voted in favor of this
amount. On the assessed valuations,
12 mills will raise approximately
$8,000, which is about the same as
was raised last year.
The budget of expenses as submit
ted was not adopted, but laid over
until next meeting, when the council
will see what can be done towards
a retrenchment in city expenditures.
Tho matter of buying an inexpens
ive fire truck was taken up and dis
cussed, but no definite action was
taken.
The ordinance calling for a special
election for the adoption or rejection
cf """endments to the charter was
j lald ovor untu next meeting,
Tlle recorder was instructed to
again write Frank L. Smith relative
to the claim the city had against him
for services of the firemen and dam
age to fire apparatus at the time his
barn at Scappoose was on fire, and
demand payment of tho bill.
It was the sentiment of the whole
council that in order to keep city
expenses within the amounts pro
posed to be raised by taxation, that
much pruning of expenses would be
necessary.
The council adjourned to meet
Monday night, November 20.
