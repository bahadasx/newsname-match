A Story of Wrong, Injustice and
Inhumanity
(From Committee on Industrial Re-
lations)
By DANTE BARTON
"Wherever there is a big Rockefeller
interest, there you find brutal slave
driving methods in the treatment, of
underpaid workers," declared Frank P.
Walsh, chairman of the Committee on
Industrial Relations, in New York, at
the height of the Bayonne, New Jer
sey, strike.
"The most dangerous as well as
brutal feature of the Rockefeller
treatment of labor is the close control
that the Rockefeller concerns gain over
the police and other public authorities.
With the Mayor of Bayonne confessing
thai he is a hired attorney for the
Rockefeller Interests, and with the
police department using its full force
and hundreds of special deputies to
beat and kill the revolting strikers,
tlie American public has its demon
stration of what Rockefellerisf means.
"Lei me call attention here to the
fact that just a few days ago on the
very side of the Ludlow massacre, 500
and more unafraid coal miners for the
Colorado Fuel & Iron Company (a
Rockefeller corporation) joined in a
union affiliated with the United Mine
Workers of America. That splendid
fact proves that Rockefeller cannot
break down the spirit of his workers,
however much he may be able to beat
them back into sullen subjection, as
he has done, and is doing now in
Bayonne.
"The breaking of the strike of un
organized and helpless Polish men and
women was brought about by such
complete brutality that every news
paper in New York was constrained
to publish articles in protest. Many
of these newspapers, in fact, most
willingly condemned the methods of
the police. Just what these methods
were can be partly surmised from the
following statement of the chief in
spector of police, who worked for the
Rockefellers precisely as if he was
their hired man. Inspector Cady was
quoted in the New York levelling Post
in these words:
"How the blank can you expect
to deal with these blankety-blank
blanks, unless you can go after
'em right? The only way is to
shoot on sight whenever they try
to make trouble. They're just a
'lot of Hunks, and they think a
strike is a war. and they don't
understand anything but bullets.
Shoot 'cm —that's the only way."
In a letter to the New York news
papers after the strike had been in
progress three or four days, Dante
Barton, representing the Committee
on Industrial Relations, wrote:
"Permit me to say in your paper,
alter personal investigation in
Hayonne, that the conditions there are
the usual ones where a great number
of unorganized and underpaid workers
break forth in revolt. The conditions
there are that the great crowd of the
strikers are like a crowd of sheep, in
furiated, even as sheep can become,
and opposed to them is a disciplined
number of policemen, special deputies
and private gunmen. The control of
the situation at every moment, as far
as tin re was control, lay with the
police ami gunmen. The only unsafe
portion of Constable Hook for me to
visit was that portion in the actual
possession of the police. Three min
utes before 1 reached a street intersec
tion a woman had been killed in a
second story window, near that cross-
Ing, and from half a dozen to a dozen
pi rsons wounded, some seriously, by
shots fired by the police and guards."
Mr. Amos Pinchot, representing the
National Labor Defense Counsel, has
joined me in sending to the Depart
ment of Labor the following telegram:
"We respectfully urge the De
part nielli of Labor to send con
ciliators or mediators immediately
to Bayonne, Something should he
done soon to stop the killing and
wounding of strikers by police
men, deputies and gunmen In the
employ of Hie Standard Oil. Per
sonal investigation warrants this
statement. Relieve you can do
much good to avert a reign of
terror among thousands of work
er who are being both terrorized
ami InfuriatdS by such legalized
injustice."
"| believe it Will not forbid your
publication of this statement, that
those ot "s who form the Committee
on Industrial Relations and the Na
tional Labor Defense Counsel ap
preach nil industrial disputes from the
Standpoint of sympathy with the
workers who have the ambition to
try for better conditions in life.
•It is, of course, inevitable that
I when a great crowd of undisciplined
workers break out in an ambitious re
volt against conditions that have
stunted and often times brutalized
'them, that then there should be on
their part acts of violence and resent
ment, but I give personal testimony
jthat. the brutality of repression, the
absolute cruelty and wantonness of
the police and gunmen in this second
recent big Bayonno strike was enough
jto goad any set of men into acts of
violence. It. is both pitiful and ter
rible, that men and women who are
| forbidden the right to organize to get
better wages and better living in an
orderly way, are immediately clubbed,
shot and terrorized when they try,
through the only way which is per
mitted to them, to better their condi
ion in life.
"Such Polish and allied workers as
are on strike now in Bayonne are
normally industrious, patient and
kindly. Their disposition is to get
"American standards" of work and
wages, peacefully, and as a matter of
organized right. If some of the
younger persons among them, mostly
hoys, do things to "incite to riot,"
what is their blame compared to that
merited by officers of the law and by
privately employed detectives and
guards and gunmen? These latter are
the incitors to riot and rebellion.
"Is it not a terrible indictment of
Standard Oil and irresponsible big
business of that type that after all its
dealings with labor it still has nothing
better lo offer than the old cave man
idea of getting the better of weaker,
less cunning men and women and then
beating them over the head and shoot
ing them when they rebel against the
superior force and cunning? As an
American, too, I'believe you will voice
a protest against the disposition to
use the term "foreigner" as a term of
reproach, and to indicate that every
man and woman worker who is not
content with brutalizing conditions of
poverty is un-American. Is it. true that
the only safe man to oppress and to
kick is an American? Let those
"foreigners" realize that "American"
sentiment upholds (heir rightful ambi
tion to put common labor on the plane
Of comfortable living, and they will
not need to express their demands in
a disorderly and possibly riotous way.
"Such industrial disputes, when
they reach such a stage, always begin
with the hopeful enthusiasm of the
mass of workers, and always end with
the triumph over them of the dis
ciplined hired private armies. There
is not only fearful pathos and tragedy
in this, but fearful danger in It. And
it happens that this is the only coun
try in the world where armed guards
and machine guns and the other
weapons that go with them may be
privately employed to do the police
business of society. The Standard Oil
in Bayonne has proceeded to put down
the strike of its underpaid common
labor with a ruhleas use of machine
guns, armored motor boats and other
engines and agents of actual warfare,
as If its very purpose was to goad the
patient strikers into violence and thus
to destroy them.
"To blame only the inarticulate
sheep who have been goaded into i
temporary fury by acts of cruelty and
incompetence sanctioned by law is
merely to accentuate the danger. If
the public could know all the imme
diate facts and the economic back
ground out ot which these facts
spring, the active sympathy of the
public would necessarily he with the
unhappy workers for the Standard Oil
in Hayonne."
lit response to the telegram of this
committe, and of the National Labor
Defense Counsel, the Labor Depart
ment at Washington sent John A. Mof
fitt as investigator. Mr. Moffitt has
urged complete federal investigation
into the causes of the strike and its.
events.
The situation is one which calls not
only for thorough federal investigation
under the Department of Labor, but it
is one which ought to enlist the con
slant attenion of the public. Nothing
that the government can recommend
or do could he nearly as effective as
popular demonstrations in resentment
in the use of the police and special
deputies.
The most brutal methods of repres
sion have been used in the name of
the public, without any regard to the
right or wrong of the dispute and with
out any attempt to give the strikers a
chance to get a fair deal by fair nego
tiations. It has been said, and prob
ably accurately, that in this strike no
gunmen or guards have been employed
privately, but the same thing has been
accomplished by simply using the
police department precisely as If it
were a private possession of the oil
plant.

MISSON OF THE
CENTRAL BODY
There are many men in every com
munlty who question the value of a
local trades council if (hey do not only
floul it as a wasteful expenditure of
their local money. These may he
roughly divided in two classes those
who are not familiar with the duties
of the council and those who are not
satisfied, for various reasons, with the
actions of the existing central body.
lioth of these classes have one point
in sympathy—that they refuse to serve
as delegates to the council.
The trades council, or local city, or
country control body, by whatever
mime it may he called, is an essential
feature of our trade union movement
and to decry or attempt to belittle its
Influence is a serious mistake. When
the dignity and importance of its mis
sion are appreciated and delegates are
sent to represent the various locals
that are intelligent and sincere work
ers in the union movement, it. quickly
assumes its place as the bulwark of
the labor movement in its community.
The purposes of a local central body
are to weld into closer relationship
the local unions in its jurisdiction;
first, that they may have the greater
influence in the settlement of any dis
putes that may exist between em-
ployers and the members of any af
filiated local of the council; second, to
make possible to co-operate in the ex
tension of organization; third, to give
the opportunity for harmonious co
operation in the selection of men and
measures in a political sense.
When the unions in any locality ap
proach their local trades council with
a clear understanding of these func
tions in their mind and make their
attainment possible by the selection of
their most capable men, there is no
dissatisfaction with the work of their
central organization. We are but re
peating a truism when we write that
90 per cent of the dissatisfaction with
trades councils can be directly traced
to a neglect or an ignorance of the
part it plays in the scheme of trade
unionism.
The too common method of leaving
the responsibility of the work of a
trades council to a few willing workers
lis sure to promote dissatisfaction and
discord. I is a work that singularly
demands the untiring efforts of the
best men in the unions in order that
the best results may be achieved. This
is not written as a defense of local
central bodies, but as an explanation
to the many wokers who are inclined
to underestimate their importance.
Let each union affiliated with the
trades councils send their best talent
to these organizations, and if the dele
gales will enter the work with an ap
peciatlon of its importance and a real
desire to see the cause of organized
labor advance, they will quickly
realize the impetus that such a body
can give to their movement.—Labor

ROBERT H. MILLS
IS NOT GUILTY
So declared a jury in Judge Bell's
icourt last Tuesday night, .Mr. .Mills
was tried for inciting riot on Aug. 28.
The judge's charge to the jury was
fair. Tlie jury was fair and nothing
unfair is left to be charged to any
body but the Commercial Club.
The Journal has said before and it
now reiterates that no riot has been
incited in this town by any one, or any
organization excepl the Everett Com
tin rcial Cltih and the mill owners who
control it.
There were policemen present when
that row took place on August 28th,
they wore in the thick of it, but no
arrests were made. What sort of a
riot do you call that ?
Xo, arrests wore not made until the
Commercial Club, thirsting tor the
gore of union men, demanded those
arrests. Their open shop hearts were
breaking because no Shingle Weavers
were deprived of their liberties.
The Tribune, the organ of the Com
mercial Club, is not satisfied with the
verdict. Nobody expected it to be,
But a very large majority of the peo
ple of this town are satisfied with it.
JAPANESE-AMERICAN
RELATIONS
We reprint the following editorial
from the Coast Seamen's Journal of
October 11 to show the trend of
thought among trades unionists in
California on the Japanese labor ques
tion:
"While the Hearsts and their ilk are
crying for more big guns and still
'bigger' battleships to protect our
shores against a Japanese invasion
which they say is hound to come,
sooner or later, the workers of both
countries are beginning to take things
in their hands and are commencing to
solve their own problems in their own
way.
"Last year's convention of the Cali
fornia State Federation of Labor, for
the first time in history seated two
fraternal delegates representing a
small group of organized workers in
.Lilian. In admitting these Japenese
|to the councils of labor no change in
; policy was necessary. Nowhere, ex
cept in tlie minds of professional poli-
Iticians and journalistic jingoes, was
lit suggested that the seating of these
[delegates affected the attitude or
! modified the demand of organized
| American labor for the exclusion of
jail Asiatic laborers from our shores.
(These delegates from Japan were wel
comed because it is in accordance with
the tenets of international unionism
and certainly to the direct advantage
]of American unionism to aid and en
courage the working people in Japan
to organize and better their conditions.
"A year has passed and one of the
two Japanese delegates who was in
attedance at last year's convention
lias again crossed the Pacific and was
again accorded the privilege of the
floor at the State Federation of Labor
! convention.
j "Delegate Suzuki reported splendid
progress in organizing the workers of,
this nave land. He said the toilers of
Japan had been inspired by the mes
sage Of good will from America and
had resolved to follow the example of
American workers and improve their
own standard by organized self-help.
Bui the delegate from Japan brought
another message, It was in the nature
lOf a request to send a trade unionist
fraternal delegae from California to
I the fifth anniversary of the Laborers'
iFrledlj Society in Japan. 10 be held
in Tokio next spring.
"Tlie reason for the unanimous ac
ceptance of Ihis invitation and the
general attitude of the organized
workers in California toward their
fellow workers in Japan are concisely
set forth in the resolution upon this
subject, as adopted by the convention:
"Whereas. The organized labor
movement of California and of Amer
ica standi ever ready to assist the
workers of every country, color and
creed, to emancipate themselves from
exploitation; and
"YVheeas, It has been necessary at
times lor the working class of this
eour.it> to protect their standard of
living by favoring the exclusion of
foreign competition, in the spirit alone
of imperative necessity anil self-pro
tection; and
'Whereas. We have learned, with
interest and gratification, that the
workers of Japan tire organizing into
Industrial unions for their own welfare
a movement we Can endorse; there
fore be it
"Resolved, By the Seventeenth An
nual Convention of the California
State federation of Labor, that we
give to Mr. Suzuki, the fraternal dele
gate front the Laborers' Friendly So-
Iciety of Japan, our expression of good
iwill and a message of hope and en
couragement for a brighter future to
the working class of his country: and
he it further
"Resolved, That, in assuming this
position of a greater friendship be
tween the workers of the Bast and the
Wesi, we must continue our unswerv
ing stand upon exclusion until such j
time as immigration will not prove a'
menace to our own unions, our work
ing people ami our standard of living;
I and be it furt her
"Resolved, That the question of send
ing ;i fraternal delegate from this body
to the labor convention in Japan be
referred to the executive committee
of this federation, with the hope that
a delegate can he selected to carry a
message of good will and encourage
ment to the laboring class of Japan.
"Additional comment upon Ameri
can-Japanese working class relations
seems wholly unnecessary. However,
if the action of the California State
Federation of Labor furnishes any
points to strengthen the arguments of
bloodthirsty jingoes in either country
we should he very glad indeed to hear
from them."
LAUNDRY GIRLS
WIN THEIR FIGHT
The Seattle Times of the 12th says:
"The first civil actions brought in
King County to recover from a former
employer the difference between the
amounts received and the legal mini
mum wage of $9 a week for women
more than 18 years old resulted yester-j
day in Justice of the Peace Otis W. I
Brlnker's court in victories for Julia!
Welch, Rose Bishop and Birdie McCoy,
i formerly employed by the Model Laun
dry Company.
] "The services were performed in
j1914 and 1915 and were brought under
[the statute which provides that 'if any

legal minimum wage said employe
shall be entitled to recover in a civil
action the full amount of the legal
minimum wage, together with costs
land atorney's fees to be fixed by the
court, notwithstanding any agreement
[to work for such lesser wage."
"Julia Welch alleged that between
August. 24, 1914. and November 27,
1915, she worked sixty-six full weeks,
that there was due her under the law
j $594, but that she received' only!

she was legally entitled to $504. Her
judgment was for $95.15 and interest.
Birdie McCoy alleged that between
October 11 and November 27. 1915. she
was paid $54.25, when under the law
she was entitled to $6S. Judge Brinker
gave her judgment for $8.75 with in

"Tlie laundry company defended the
actions on the grounds that tile
women were worked by the hour and
paid at the legal rate, that they had
accepted their wages without com
plaint and had not asked for more at
the time the services were rendered."
FIRED FOR TALKING
On the day of the battle between
the I. W. W.s and the Commercial
Club deputies at the city dock I met
John Hanson on Colby avenue, when
he asked me if I heard of the shooting
on the dock and said the I. W. W. had
shot a whole lot of our good citizens.
I answered that it was good enough
for them, as they ought to have stayed
away.
Later my employer, Mr Kelly, the
contractor, discharged me for making
that remark, It was only an idle re
mark that 1 made, but its after-effect
was enough for me to warn all persons
to be careful what they say in the
pi e-.nee of John Hanson, the furniture
dealer on Hoyt avenue

Now that the smoke of battle has

sults may not be out of place.
The legislature which is soon to

the United State-, and while branding
itself with infamy, has taught the peo
ple some lessons ivhich should never
be forgotten. That body attempted to
force backward every forward step the
people have taken in a quarter of a
century.
j It passed seven bills which for cun
ning and deceit have not been equaled
in the legislative annals of this
I country.
; By herculean efforts those measures
• were uexeated at the polls and we
hope have passed into oblivion. An
other legislature will not dare to do
jas much dirty work in one session.
j The lesson taught the people is that
they pay too little attention to the
Iselecion of the men to make their
laws. They care too much for the ex
ecutive branch ol government, the
I duty of which Is to execute the laws
j enacted by the legislative branch.
