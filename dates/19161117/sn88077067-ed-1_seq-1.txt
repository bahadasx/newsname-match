That he has a roving disposition,
neithered cared for a home nor to
make a home and declared upon fre
quent occasions that he had no love
and affection for his wife, was the
claim set up in a petition for divorce
filed in court by Mrs. Juanita M
Grapner against her husband, Harry
J. Grapner of 1178 Forest avenue.
They were married in Celina on Sep
lumber 12, 1907, and have three
children, Thoral, 7 years old; George
.., and Darrelle, 18 months of age.
On account of his mistreatment a
week ago, she says, she was compell
ed to seek shelter of relatives and
friends. That he would work hard
for a time and then give up his posi
tion, spend his money for drink and
abuse her, she claimed. She asked
and was granted a restraining injunc.

lKKTIXG OF CITY DADS
At the regular meeting of Council
last Tuesday evening the Board of
Public Affairs solicited the dads to
furnish them with $15,000 to change
the water-works plant from the pre
sent deep water wells, producing un
usable hard water, to a soft and plen.
titul water supply to be obtained
from the reservoir. The plans provide
for a complete change of the plant
and also for the pun hase of a new
steam engine and electric generator.
The matter will be taken up at
an adjourned meeting of Council on
next Monday night.
Dr. Miller will operate this after
noon at his bffiee upon a patient from
Ansonia, for the removal of cancer.
The operation is confined to one side
of the face and will be a very tedious
bit of surgery.

Mercer County's Fourth Annual
Christian Endeavor Convention held
in the Presbyterian Church at Rock
ford last Friday and Saturday was a
huge success tlthough the number in
attendance was not quite what sev
eral of the County Officers anticipat
ed. It was beyond the expectations
of the rank and file of the Endeav-
orers. At 2:30 Friday afternoon 24
delegates had registerd and the last
one to register on Saturday morning
making a total of 85. The sessions
were arranged somewhat as follows:
The forenoon session on Friday was
taken up by naming of special com
mittees, reading of minutes, other
small business affairB and an address
given by the State Supt. of Quiet
Hour Dep't. and Evangelism, . Rev.
Frank L. Freet of Cincinnati. Few
speakers whether of national fame
or not can so bold an audience intent
to the last word. Rev. Freet has in
his .personality a very large measure
of optimism and together with rapid
ness of thought and clear-headed
thinking faculty, he makes an orator
that any one. Christian Endeavor or
not, cannot help but enjoy. The se
cret of it all hasn't been stated yet-
here it Is: he Is so filled with the
love of the work he Is doing that
his wcrds constitute one constant
flow of good wholesome food for any
one to partake of. He is the best in
dex to energetic living, intense
Christian activity to be found any
where In the state. Needless to say
that his presence in a conveition out.
side of his stated addresses Is an in
spiration to anyone. He is always
ready to help, whether it be his own
choosen line of work or not. His ad

l.r.SSON FOR WAIJi STUKKT
Boston, Mass., November 9. Edi
torial comments on Wilson's election:
The PostThe outstanding lesson
is that a President can be elected In
the face of the tremenduous Influence
and hostility of Wall street. This
clique of financiers, bound by claims
of gold to the "Interests," moved
heaven and earth to encompass the
defeat of Woodrow Wilson. It Is un
disputed that it spent millions to
down him. That It failed Is one of
the splendid slgnB of the times and
the forerunner of a new American
political freedom.
The Journal The reelection
of
Wilson is far from sending the
country to the eternal bow-wows. We
have all along credited the President
with motives of the highest altruism
and paradoxical as that may seem
that has been his most grevious
fault. With his head in the clouds
of brotherhood-of-man Ideas, he has
failed to know that his feet were go
Ing roughshod through the valley of
American dignity and pride; he must
pull In his altruistic horns think in
more selfish terms of his own coun
try first.
The Herald We may as well ad
mil now, that we have to depend on
our hindsight, that there were many
Influences that worked not for the
Democratic party, but for Wilson
alone, which no effort on the part of
the Jlepuhlicans could counteract,
"He kept us out of the war" was the
most potent, beyond a doubt It at
tracted a host of men and women
to his standard.
New Orleans, La., November 10,
The Tlmes-Plcuyane In an editor
ial this morning, says Jt was Wil
son s policy toward labor and his
firmness in keeping the country out
of war that won for him.
"Whilte It looks a bit dubious"
says the Times-Picayune "the vote
cast for Mr. WjHson In the West is
flattering. It humbles the so-called
East, I t vindicates the Democratic
doctrine.
The Times-Picuyane conservative
ly goes on to say that perhaps Mr.
Wilson might not be re-elected if the
counts demanded by Republican
managers through probes go through
but treats this phrase lightly.
The Daily States, organ of Nation
al Committeeman Robert Ewlng,
who is now In New York, says that
Wilson has been elected by 273 votes
in Electorial College. The item has
no expression, being closed tight all
night.
GEK.M.W PAPERS SAY WILSOX
YICTOKY MEAX9 PEACE
Amsterdam, Nov. 11 Great sur
prise is expressed in German news
papers received here over the reelec
tion of President Wilson.
Where there was doubt expressed
in previous editions that the presi
dent again had been chosen, all now
accept his re-election as a matter of
fact.
The Cologne Gazette editorially
said: "The only fundamental desire
of the American people Is peace.
They procured a victory. With Wil
son remaining our relations with
America will continue unchanged."
The' Cologne Volkszeitung said:
H s( rem-thens our conlidence that the
United States will remain neutral."
Ceil Leonhard, west of town was
painfully Injured Monday when the
barrel of a shotgun bursted. The
gun wat, of the breech loading type
and it seems was loaded too heavilv.
One piece of the barrel went throii::!:
the muscles of his left forearm and
another piece lodged in the flesh.
Another piece of the gun struck his
lower lip, breaking off one tooth and
damaging several more. Mr. Leon
hard is getting along nicely but the
injuries are very painful. Ft. Re

They were a uniform lot and Barney
