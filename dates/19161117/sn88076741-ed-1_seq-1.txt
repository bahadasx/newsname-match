While the republicans have apparently
lost ^he presidency they are now claim
lag*,small majority in tike Bouse
tufas as yet are hot complete, iut it is
oertatn that about the best left for the
dcMpocrats is a tie.
With a republican majority or even
W*t^a small democratic majority, Pres
ident Wilson will find himself in the.
power of the House. Witha large worl
ing majority in both thet &ienate aad {til

Jforth Dakota, which for some hours
occupied a pivotal position, white the
c«untry was awaiting returns from other
doubtful states, made the rather absurd
«b»»ce of
republican ticket by an over­
a
whelming majority and by delfeatinK.it's
foismer popular demo :ratic idol, John
BttrJi^for the Senate, and going for tbe
democratic presidential candidate about
1600majority. It seems to us that it
muat be a queer conglomeration of -be
iiefs and principles within the brains of
the voter who can consistently support
Wilson, -McCumber, Frazier and dem
ocxate as members of ibe state legisla
ture -8ucb. voters and in North Dakota
-these^are in a majority were emphati
cally "nonpartisans." The varying sorts
and eizeB^of candidates thus collected
and elected by these cross-over voters
make us think of the "Happy Family
ooliections displayed in the manajgeries.
Well, it is over and it is well that it is
over. The people have expressed opin
ions wiiich will be heeded by the elected.
The majority will bold tbe helm but the
minority will do much in giving the
course that must be steered. Tbe nar
row margin will make prdsedent and tbe
majority sit qp and take notice.
This is a government by party and it is
the best sort of government in the world.
