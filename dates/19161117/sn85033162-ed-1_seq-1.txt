NEWPORT
Mr. and Mrs. J. N. R. Bell of
Corvallls are spending a few
"weeks at the beach.. ,Dr. Bell
Itaa spent his outings and vaca
tion for mora than fortv veara
at Newport. Of all the beaches
n the Oregon coast this Is his
favorite for health and pleasure.
Abe King of Corvallis spun),
icveral days In Newport, looking
Iter and paying taxes on lots
and blocks that belong to the es
tate of his father the late Sol
King.
Dr. C E. Linton was in town
daring the week. The Doctor
says, had Mrs. Hanley canvassed
In California and Washington as
she did in Oregon both states
would have gone for Hughes.
This little woman is a wonder.
Sho, in the commencement of
the campaign, sold two pigs that
she might get clothes and an
outfit to enable her to canvass
tho state in the interest of the
Republican candidate. These
pigs will no doubt go into the
pork barrel to swell the salary of
Siome Democratic ofnc? holder.
Villa and his bandits, under
Zapata, massacred one hundred
innocent and defenceless women
and children in Mexico a few
lays ago. The conditions in
that unfortunate country is get
ting worse every day. No quar
ter is given now by these cruel
outlaws. Neither sex, age or
condition are spared, in that dis
tracted country. All are mur
dered. Villa in his desperation
may cross the border line and
into New Mexico and Texas
in his raids. He and his bandits
don't seem to fear Uncle Sam or
Carranza either.
The Women of Woodcraft
;ave Dr. Wallace Hylander and
hia new bride, nee Emma War
nock, a kitchen shower and Mrs.
Ed Stocker a birthday party at
their hall, Thursday evening. . A
large number of their friends
"were present. A nice luncheon
wa3 served and a good time was
had by all prenset Dr. and Mrs.
Hylander will continue to reside
In Newport where he will con
tinue to practice his profession
as a dentist.
Saturday morning at about
ight o'clock, the residence of
Airs. M. M. Ellis on Second and
Case Street took fire from a de
fective stove pipe. The house
-was occupied by Mrs. Metzenger
and Mrs. Bryon. The Are alarm
'was turned in and the fire de
partnient responded as soon as
tjssible. In a very short time
two hose were playing upon the
building but the fire had got un
dar such headway that it was
impossible to save the building
although the firemen worked
tok trogens. The most of the
household furniture and goods
-were saved. The upper part of
the building was almost entirely
destroyed. The fire started in
the kitchen and the building be
tas very dry the file spread
rapidly. The loss is about $1,
OOO, mostly covered by insur
ance. About 35 years ago this
house was built by Blllie Stltts
at a cost of $3000. It was a fine
building In those days but It is
Tld fashioned and badly decayed.
Mrs. Ellis had put Beveral hun
dred dollars In fixing up and re
pairing the building. The dry,
fold weuther and the east wind
blowing is a good time for a
houne to take fire. The people
Jihould examine their flues and
see that they are all right, "A
stitch in time saves nine."
The state has gone bone dry
and no one can handle booze
but preachers and doctors.
Preachers can have It for sa
cramental purposes an the doc
tors for medicine.
The next things to go will he
tobacco and coffee and this will
be followed by other supposed
evils and the Lord only knows
-when It will stop. The world Is
becoming effeminate and spine
less and temptations must be re
moved. The old rule as practiced by
'Saint Paul, the humble Nazarln,
and others, to overcome evil
must be abandoned and life
made easy by removing all
temptations, Instead of over
coming them. When the Roman
'Rmplre fell the people had be
come so grossly 'wicked and li
centious' that the elty could 'ndt
stand any longer. The trend of
the times seem to be in that di
rection now. The strong man
is the one that resists and over
comes temptation.

PORT DIVISION MADE
A joint meeting of committees
of the Newport and Toledo
Ports was held at Toledo last
Saturday for the purpose of
reaching an agreement as to the
' enlargement of these port dis-
tricts. It has been decided that
it will be better for those ports
to maintain their individuality
as at present, rather than to con-
BOlidate the two into one.
It was
agreed that the Umber lands of
Siletz be divided equally by the " , action
two. The work on the bar will thls Pfr- Game called at the
be paid for equally by the two jusual tlme
ports, and all local Improve-j 0 ;
ments be paid for by the port j LOCAL TEACHERS' MEETING
making the improvement. Ed I
Stocker, R. F. Baker and B. F. There will be a local institute
Jones represented the Newport
Port and Lee Wade, A. T. Peter-
son and W. E. Ball lepresented
the local Port. While the agree-
ment reached was not iust what
the local committee wanted, still
t is thought that It is better to
have the matter settled in an
amicable manner than to have
continual bickering.
Now let us all pull for a bigger
and better Yaqulna harbor.

NEWPORT 3; TOLEDO 0
The Toledo High School foot
ball boys went to Newport last
Saturday and played the high
school team of that place, the
game resulting as above. The
game was a good clean game
from start to finish, and no pen
alties were given either side. The
Newport team was considerably
heavier than the local bunch,
and we consider that the boys
did fine to Jteep the heavy New
port backs from making several
touchdowns. In the early part
iu me game iuc ncwpurieiB
I rushed the ball down to within
the shadow of our goal posts.
Then our boys stiffened up and
held them like a stone wall, and
secured the ball on downs, punt
ing out of danger.
The Newport boys made their
score on a well executed kick
from the twenty yard line.
Toledo had one chance to win
when McMillan intercepted a

!a clear Held, but unfortunately
tor j oiedo s hopes of victory, he
stepped in a hole and fell bciore
crossing the enemy's goal line.
In. the last quarter was when
the superior weight of the New
porters began to tell, and they
ploughed through the line for
long gains, but Toledo always
managed to get the ball In the
nick of time and would punt
out of danger. The stars for
Newport were Ralph Culver,
Mark Jarmiu and Simon Lond
ten. For Toledo, Earling Brauti,
Basil Lutey, Tcrrence Galther
and Jack llaskett and the punt:
ing of McMillan furnished the
thrills.
Officials were: Referee, John
Miller; umpire, C. O. Hawkins.
