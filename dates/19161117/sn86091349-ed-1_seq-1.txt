BREAKAGE OF CASTING
STOPS AMALGAMATED MILL
The milling plant of the Amalga
mated Pioche company has been shut
down for about ten days on account
of the breaking ot an important
casting in one of the grinding mills
and the necessity of waiting for re
pairs to arrive. Meanwhile, a num
ber of minor changes have been made
in the plant as well as the installa
tion of a steam heating system in
the building. It is expected that the
mill will be in operation again to
morrow morning. During the shut
down the exposed pipes in and about
the company's works have been
plated under cover and otherwise
put in shape to stand the cold win
ter. There has been no let-up in the
work in the mine, pending the mak
ing of repairs in the mill. As a re
