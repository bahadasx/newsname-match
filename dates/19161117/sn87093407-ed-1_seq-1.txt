•AFTER MISHAP
NEW LONDON, Conn., Nov. 17.—An at
tempted dash to sea by the German sub
mar.*l?e Deutschland ended early today in a
collision between the supersubmersible and
an escorting tug in which Captain Guerney
and four members of the tug's crew were
drowned.
The Deutschland, bound for Bremen, put
back to port after the collision and by 5 a. m.
was again warped into her pier. She was
once more shielded by the liner Willehad,
her "mother ship," and the big steel nets
swung in place to further guard her.
Work was immediately begun by a small
army of workmen to learn the extent of the
submarine's damages as a result of her sec
■M%d collision during the present trip. She
smashed into a pier when she made her
start from Bremen and was held up 10 days
for repairs.

PHONE EXTORTION
HERE IS EXPOSED

'Fair Decisions by Public Service Commis
sion or City-Owned Phones" Is His Rem
edy for Discrimination
(The second article on regulation of public utilities by C.
A Reynold*, former chairman «f the state public service com
mission. deals with what he terms "telephone extortion with ap
proval of the state." and is printed herewith.— EDITOR
On the Sth day of August, 1916, an order estab
lishing rates and practices of the telephone company in
the state of Washington, and eliminating what the tele
phone company is pleased to call "obsolete rates," wa
signed by Public Service Qmimissioners K. F. Blaine,
A. V. Lewis and Frank R. Spinning.
The elimination of the so-called "obsolete rates"
was based upon Section 11 of the public service com
mission statute, which reads as follows:
"No telegraph or telephone company shall,
directly or indirectly, or by any special rate, re
bat?, drawback or other other device or method,
charge, demand, collect or receive from any per
son or corporation a greater or less compensation
for any service rendered or to be rendered with
respect to communication by telegraph or tele
phone or in connection therewith, except as
authorized in this act, than it charges, demands,
collects or receives from any other person or cor
poration for doing a like and contemporaneous
service with respect to communication by telegraph
or telephone under the same or substantially the
same circumstances and conditions."
In plain IsagMfe, this section ,
/a j g; "T'.ie telephone oontpsoy I

Friday morning she was able to talk to secret

"I went to sleep on the bed," she said*
"and the next thing I knew was that I was

JUDGE READS
Trial of Margaret Strand'*
$50,000 breach of promise suit
against Peter Malone, wealthy
Fairbanks miner, was halted
Friday when Judge Gilliam
took ISO pages of typewritten
depositions with him to his
chambers to cull out the Im
proper testimony.
Attorneys for both sides ar
gued for nearly two houra Fri
day morning in relation to what
portions of the depositions
should be read to the jury.
Much of the evidence Is unf»>
vorable to Miss Strand, it is said,
as It deals with her character and
relations with men in the district
where she was employed a* cook
for Malonr
It was held that all testimony re
lating to Miss Strand rs a truthful
witness was permissible, but that
any evidence which would tend to
smirch her character could not b«
submitted to the jury.
"It would be a different proposi
tion," Attorney Thompson said. "If
Malone had admitted that he was
engaged to Mlrs Strand, for him tu
bring out evidence that she had
been unfaithful to her engagement
and that she was nn improper
woman, but he didn't. He never
admitted that he had engaged him
self to her. and now they can't in
troduce any evidence of that kind."
Malotie will attempt to prove that
his relations with Miss Strand were
entirely projier and that ho treat
ed her simply as an employe. Ho
denies that there ever was an un
derstanding between Miss strand
and himself.
