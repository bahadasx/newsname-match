LETTERS FROM
BUSINESS MEN
Read at Methodist Church
Last Sunday Night.
The following letters were writ
ten by business men of Kendrick
and read at the Methodist church
last Sundav night. Sorae of them
are too severe and exaggerate con
ditions, but there is more or less
truth in all of them. While they
may apply in some degree to Kend
rick, they would no doubt apply in
a like measure to most any other
town of the same size. They are
at least interesting. The subject
of the letters is "What's the matter
With Kendrick."
The most serious defect is that
we have some people that pretend
to be something that they really
are not. This applies to spiritual,
business and social affairs. But on
the whole Kendrick is all right.
A little better all round than the
average small town, and the man
that refuses to recognize the many
good things about Kendrick ought
to have the scaley allegations of
remorse gallop up and down with
in the internal principles of his
animal viscera until the spinal
column of his anitomical constitu
tion becomes the railroad for the
grim and gory goblins of despair.
Presuming that you wish a crit
icism of some conditions in Kend
rick, I will state only one. It is
the lack of opportunities for the
young man to advance in a busi
ness or financial way. There seems
to be lacking the necessary incen
tive for advancement in education,
business or in the professions. In
the last ten years, I cannot recall
the name of a young man from
Kendrick who has graduated from
a college.
There have been few, young men
from Kendrick who have become
lawyers, doctors, professors, preach
ers, civil, electrical or mining en
gineers or statesmen. You will
find few young men in the business
houses, offices or learning a trade
There are always some young
men who can lift themselves above
their environments, but the great
majority cannot.
This condition of Kendrick boys
is not because of their lack of am
bition or ability. I will place the
blame on the older people of the
community. We do not encourage
them as to the ways and means of
becoming useful citizens.
We have no libraries, gymnas
iums nor place of recreation for
them.
The boy's education cannot be
left entirely to the schools and
£ v '^'(urches.
I am inclined to believe that
this condition is due, to a great ex
tent, by the strife for the almighty
dollar, and the selfishness inherent
in human nature.
1st—With the Business Men.
Lack of confidence in and lack of
cooperation with each other. Each
merchant seems to be afraid that
his competitors or fellow merchant
will get a little business that might
come his way.
Lack of business ethics, which
should confine each merchant to
his particular line of merchandise
without carrying side lines which
properly l>elong to some other
merchant.
2nd—With the Women.
A realization of the equality of
women socially so long as she is
morally equal. A splitting into
cliques and squads which bars from
association those who are not (sup
posedly equal socially) either be
cause of their .church affiliations,

TFLOATING POLICE STATION
In the most unusual election the United States has experienced in many years, when even up to the last minute the un
certainty of the situation was apparent to the closest political observers, each party claimed gains. However, despite the
uncertainty of the outcome, 15,000,000 went to the polls, each feeling certain his man would win. The war in Europe was
hottest in Roumania, where the Cernavoda bridge over the Danube was destroyed; the sinking of the British steamer Marina
without warning with Americans in crew troubled our state department, while the undersea merchantman Deutschland returned to our shores. An armored
railway car built in twenty days was delivered to the United States government. New York's harbor police have been fitted out with a floating station
house. The Salvation army offered up a twenty-four hour Drayer for the recovery of their chief in America, Eva Booth.

How's This?
The Langdon brothers of Cedar
Creek ridge sold 200 sacks of beans
this week, receiving for them $7.60
a hundred. The 200 sacks were
grown on 28 acres of ground and
weighed 29,800 pounds, less 200
pounds for the weight of the sacks.
The total amount received for the
beans was $2249.60 or an average
of over $80. an acre. First class
land can be bought on Cedar Creek
for less than $80. per acre.
a
in
financial conditions or education.
3rd—With the Churches.
Lack of broad minded liberality
of creed or lack of creed. The
main idea of each church seems to
be to draw to its church alone all
desirable persons, without the
least deference to the rights or feel
ings of the other churches.
A more liberal application of the
rule "Do unto others as you would
that they should do unto you"
would not only upbuild all the
churches but \yould uplift the in
dividual outside the church.
4th—The Young People.
Either from improper training or
neglect at home, or from the wrong
example of the more influential
people of the town, fail to exhibit
the real difference and true polite
ness which must be the mainstay
and basis of a successful Kendrick
of the future generation.
WE, the people of Kendrick and
vicinity, are quick and sure to
"take sides" on any subject or in
any controversy regardless of the
fact that it does not concern or af
fect us in the least. Frankly,
speaking, the causes we champion
are not pertinent to our respective
business occupations. After flying
to the colors which we have
blindly chosen, we immediately,
and never openly, begin to critcize
our supposed antagonistic fellow
citizens and do our best to make
life miserable for them and theirs.
We carry this factional fight into
every walk of our lives, including
the churches, our business houses
and our homes.
W 7 e are divided against ourselves.
Governorship Still Unsettled
Boise, Nov. 15.—The legislature
elect of this state may finally be
called upon to settle the election
controversy rapidly reaching a cli
max over the governorship. Both
sides are making claims. W. C.
Gregory, secretary of the republi
can state central committee, issued
a statement declaring Governor
Alexander's plurality had been cut
down to 159 and that when the re
count is completed in Franklin,
Bear Lake, Oneida and Cassia coun
ties it will disappear altogether and
in its place will grow a plurality
for D. W. Davis, the republican
gubernatorial candidate. C. O.
Broxon. secretary to Governor
Alexander, makes a counter claim
that Governor Alexander's plurality
has only been cut to 513. The re
count in Bonneville county precincts
cut Governor Alexander's plurality
from 75 to 3 so that he lost 72 votes.
Both sides are watching the re
count carefully.
at
Party leaders ad
mit that contests in the courts may
finally be sent to the legislature
which has alone authority to re
count the entire vote cast in the n
state. Both branches of the legis- j
lature are democratic. A ruling
will probably be secured from the
courts to determine how scratched
ballots should be counted. Attorney
General Peterson has issued instruc
tions to all county attorneys to make
an investigation of the swearing in
of votes on election day. He says
his office is in receipt of reports to
the effect there was widespread a
buse of this privilege together with
fraudulent registration and viola
tion of the election laws.
"We are not claiming fraud of
any kind," said Secretary Gregory,
"we are standing on the broad
ground that Mr. Davis was counted
out and that on a fair count he will
be counted in by 2,000 plurality."
"There is no material change in
the gubernatorial situation," said
Secretary Broxon. "Governor
'Alexander is elected by a plurality
of something over 500. Pluralities
by counties give the governor 4,782
and Davis 4,269."
Discovery of 35 irregularly sworn
in votes was the first fruit of the
investigation ordered by Attorney
General Peterson into suspected
frauds. *
The prosecuting attorney of
Washington county declared these
35 votes to have been irregularly
sworn in on election dav and added
that 35 additional votes probably
had been irregular. These 70 votes
were among the 769 sworn in votes
on which the commissioners passed
on their first day of canvassing in
that county.
The attorney-general expects that
it may be several days before the
prosecuting attorneys of the several
counties wiil begin generally to
send in reports of their investiga
tions.
Indicted for Selling Liquor
The W. T. Raleigh 'company of
Freeport, 111., was indicted by the
federal grand jury at Moscow,
charged with shipping intoxicating
liquors to agents in the neighbor
hood of the Nez Perce Indian reser
vation in the guise of lemon ex
tract and household remedies. One
consignment of 85 quart bottles
was seized. This liquor is said to
have contained as high as 90 per
cent alcohol. The case against this
company will be prosecuted in Illi
nois. The Murphew-Hardy com
pany of Ogden, Utah, was prosecu
ted at the recent term of the United
States court for a similar offense,
and paid $1800 as a result.
The Measuring Social
About seventy-five young people
and a sprinkle of older ones, met
at the home of Mrs. G. G. Oldfield,
last Friday evening. A program
was rendered during the evening.

Camp Fire Girls Entertain
The Camp Fire Girls entertained
the Queen Esther Girls last Friday
evening at the high school auditor
ium. There were about eighteen
Camp Fire Girls present, most of
whom wore their costumes. Six
teen of the Queen Esther Girls re
sponded to the invitation.
The auditorium was prettily dec
orated with shrubbery and house
plants.
Games of all kinds furnished
much pleasure for the evening. At
10:30 * light refreshments were
served by Misses Long, Florance
and Guy after which the girls left
for their homes, having passed a
jolly evening.
Why You Should Subscribe
There is every reason why every
resident of any community which
'
i
which
has a local newspaper should be a
subscriber. The newspaper is the
printed link that binds their inter
ests into a whole. It is the get-ac
quainted, get-together medium.
Thru it you communicate with vour
neighbors in every direction. It
not only purports to give the news
considered of general interest in
the community but it contains ad
voisements that are of direct value.
Mr. A. has a cow for sale; Mr. B.

town is looking for such a cow. The
paper locates the buyer. The mer
chant tells his trading community
about his wares in the same paper. !
the reader profits, if he needs that
artfcle. The newspaper is the need-i
ed publicity organ of the neighbor
hood. It is one of the most valued
and by many the most prized insti
tutions in the community. Why
shouldn't all be subscribers?
LETTER
FROM THE EAST
The Last Word From Our
Eastern Correspondent
Editor Gazette :
In my last letter the City of
Washington was reluctantly left be
hind. The next stop was Mt. Ver
non, a place of great historic inter
est. How many interesting things
surround this venerable place!
One feels that he is treading on
hallowed ground as he thoughtfully
moves about the place made famous
by the presence of George Washing
ton. Everything about this won
derful spot has upon it the mark of
age. Trees and shrubbery 150
years old are common and every
thing dates back to the days when
Washington called the place home.
Alexandria, Virginia is closely
associated with Mt. Vernon as it
was here in Christ Church that
Washington worshipped. His pew
remains unchanged. The well-pre
served carriage or coach in which
he was accustomed to ride to church
is in marked contrast to the more
modern mode of travel,
^ visit to Arlington Cemetery
was m0 st impressive. In this time
0 f war f are 0 ne takes into account
more clearly the awfullness of war.
H ere j s a monument under which
| ie t h e bones of more than two
thousand unidentified soldiers of the
Civil War . Headstones mark the
grave s of 21,763 soldiers. Many
0 f these stones contain nothing but
1 a num ber, but what matters it to
him whose body lies beneath—he
died for his country.
"On Fame's eternal camping ground
Their silent tents are spread,
And glory guards with silent sound
The bivouac of the dead." .
Again we are all aboard a fast
train for Cumberland, Maryland.
Here we leave the well equipped
cars of the B. & O. and resort to
the oldest method of travel known
to man. Four miles brings us to a
deserted village known as Welters
burg, Pennsylvania. We had once
before visited a flourishing village
here but that was sixty years ago.
This place was interesting from its
loneliness so far as human beings
are ooncerned, but the autumn fol
iage has probably been equalled but
never surpassed. It would pay the
professional tourist to travel thou
sands of miles to witness the au
tumnal beauties of this quaint old
village.
From here we crossed the Alle
ghanies in a real automobile and it
was worth the price. Berlin, the
headquarters of the Pennsylvania
Dutch, was our next objective. The
town is noted for its age; the sur
rounding country for its big houses
and mammoth barns. It is here
that the son builds on the founda
tion ) aid by his father. Homes
hav e been in the same families for
f ound our old school master
many generations and the people
seem therewith content. Here we
still
hale and hearty, living in luxury.
He seemed to feel a just pride in
the inclination he had given to this
particular twig.
Now we approach the hallowed
spot where first we saw the light of
day. The circuit is now complete.
These many years of wandering
. have brought us back to the place
QUr beginning and why say more,
!
Our feelings are too deep for tears,
too sacred to be unveiled to the
casual reader. We have taken
f rom the Gem State Fair in Idaho
to Buffalo Hill, Pennsylvania. The
words we h aV e used so many times
to friends on this brief journey we
now pass on to our readers—"Good
Bye."
