Why Torture Them?
, The democrats are to have some
kind of a meeting in Brookfield
and the Argus says "Colonel Aber
has composed and will sing a

democrats should be punished for
their political sins, but why torture
them in this manner. Here is
plainly a case where the humane
society should step in. ; " -

St. Joseph Stock Market
The following article appeared in
the St. Joseph Stock Yards
Journal, under date of November
15. The B. F. Johnson referred
to is Mr. Frank Johnson, who has
sold his farm east of Purdin, and
is now living in Linneus.
'B. F. Johnson, one of Linn
county's oldest and most highly
respected stock raiser and farmer
had a three car consignment of
stock cattle here today, which were
fed on his big farm, close to
Purdin. This is the first shipment
or stock Mr. Johnson nas ever
made to. the St. Joseph market,
aud while our market was con
siderably lower, Mr. Johnson said
that the price he had received was
highly satisfactory, and fully as
much as he had expected for them
when he loaded them on the cars
at Purdin, Missouri."
The cattle referred to above were
sold on the St. Joseph market by
the Cooper & Vindle Commission
Co., who seem to be getting many
shipments from Linn county. We
might also say that Verne Brown,
