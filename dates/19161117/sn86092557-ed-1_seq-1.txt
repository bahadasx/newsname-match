CORNWELL'S STATEMENT.
CHARLESTON. W. Va? Nov. 17.?
John J. Cornwell, governor-elect, made
a statement lo the public of West Virginia
last night in regard lo the calling
of the extra session of the legislature
by Governor Hatfield, which, In
part, is as follow-B:
"We are to have the turmoil and expense
of a special session to save the
jobs of some men who have devoted
tneir time to politics instead of to their
public business. 1 made my primary,
us well us the general campaign, upon
I he contention that we have been having
too much polities in our state government,
announcing often that men
connected with the state government
and public institutions who gave their
time to the public business and were
decent lu their political activities
would have nothing to fear from me.
"The pretense that there is any danger
of the defeated Democratic candidates
for stato offices ousting their
successful Republican opponents is too
absurd to discuss. 1 believe that the
only way to preserve popular government
is to accept the results of an J
election, lawfully held and where the I
ballots have been properly counted and !
certified, and no one can get any aid
or comfort from me in any other
course.
"But I do want the public to know '
further that I have direct and positive j
evidence that Judge Robinson, who
has never admitted my election, has,
claimed to his family and friends all!
the time that ho will eventually be
seated; that plans have been worked
out at Republican state headquarters
at Clarksburg looking to that end; that
Governor Hatfield, the legislature and
tho place holders are actually expected
to use strong-arm tactics.
"I am a law-abiding citizen and not
a revolutlonost. but I have been elected
governor of this state and I feel
that 1 owe it to the people who mado
this a fight for and with me to use
every lawful effort to sco that a dictatorshiD
Is not set UD hero In Wnst Vir. I
glnla. I would prove myself unwor-|
thy of the confidence the people Imposed
In me at the late election were !
I not willing to continue to lead theni ;
and make any sacrifice to prevent the 1
high-handed plans being consummated j
to overthrow popular government in
this state."

FALCONER CHILD
SHOE BY PLAYMATE
Hutchinson Boy Was Showing
Little Girl How Rifle
Worked.
Jeanette Etowlo Falconer, aged S,
oiliest daughter of Dr. and Mrs. H. S.
Falconer, was accidentally shot and
killed last night by her playmate Melville
Hutchinson, jr., aged 11, son of
Mr. and Mrs. M. L. Hutchinson. The
accident occurred at live o'clock last
evening when the children were playing
at the Hutchinson home.
The lad had been shooting a rifle
and was explaining the mechanism to
his playmate. Ho threw the "safety"
catch, explaining that the rifle could
not then be fired and to demonstrate
his statement, pulled the trigger. For
some reason the "safety" device failed
to work and the rifle was discharged,
a bullet entering the child's heart
causing Instant death. The rifle was
of 22 calibre.
The cries of the lad brought immediate
assistance. Mrs. Falconer, mothor
of the dead child, who lives but a
few doors from the Hutchinson homo,
summoned a physician, heing unable
to locate Ilr. Falconer, and proceeded
at once to the scene of the tragedy
not knowing until she arr!"ed there
that the victim of the accident was
her own child. It was almost an hour
before Dr. Falconer could be located.
i uu IICWD ui uic iiascuy n^icau ia|iIdly
through the city. Both chll'rfen
were well known and the sympathy
of the community for the stricken lad
who innocently took the lifo of his
playmate was nearly as much an that
expressed for the bereaved parents
at the loss of their daughter.
Jeanette Bowie Falconer was a child
of unusually attractive persoivality.
She was bright in her studies, a regular
attendant at Sunday school and
greatly beloved in her home circle.
An older brother. Horace, and a little
sister, Betty survive beside her parents.
Relatives wore notified Ia:p. night
of tile tragedy and will arrive ill the
rlt.v tnTrmyrrrr in rnmniti fnr fho opr.
vices which have not been fully ar- j
ranged. Charles Jenkins, of Morgantown,
brother of Mrs. Falconer, was
hero last night and Mrs, John Jenkins,
mother of Mrs. Falconer, and
her two daughters, Mrs. George Chadwick
and Mrs. Harry Fitch, of Indianapolis.
lnd . have loft there and will
arrive hero tomorrow morning. Mr.
Jenkins will be unable to come on
account of ill health.
Relatives of Dr. Falconer will also
