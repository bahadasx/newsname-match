CALDWELL TRIBUNE, NOVEMBER 17, 1916.
WEEKLY, $2.00 PER YEAR
PETERSON INVESTIGATES
FRAUD ALLEGATIONS
AT ELECTION
Attorney General Jos. H. Peterson
las become convinced that the
harges of fraudulent voting in Idaho
ihould be thoroughly investigated.
General Peterson has issued a letter
lo each of the prosecuting attorneys
n the counties of the state requesting
;hem to make investigations in their
respective counties and report to him.
The fraud suspected is in the
»wearing in of illegal voters on elect
ion day. General Peterson rather
trongly intimates that investigations
y grand juries may be desirable.
The letter addressed to the county
ttorneys by General Peterson is as
lows :
legal Voting Must Be Uncovered.
November 14, 1916.
the Prosecuting Attorneys of the
Several Counties of the State of
Idaho:
Gentlemen:
Evidence of the strongest kind has
■eached this office, from various parts
)f the state, that fraudulent evasion
ind violation of the election laws of
the state was practiced at the election
keld on the 7th.
From the information at hand it
would seem that a widespread abuse
D>f the privilege of swearing in quali
ied electors, as permitted by the reg
stration law of 1913, was indulged in.
There is nothing more important
inder our form of government than
:hat elections shall be free from
raud and corruption, and that the true
will of the people shall be expressed
ihereat.
I therefore request you, as county
ittorney, to institute an investigation
In your county and report to this
office :
First—The number of voters in
pour county that were registered on
lection day under the provisions of
ection 4, chapter 92, session laws of
913.
Second—Whether these persons so
egistered on election day were au
horized to be registered and to vote
nder the laws of the state.
It is not desired under this second
requirement that all cases shall be in
vestigated, but it is thought that a suf
ficient examination could be expedit
iously made which would furnish a
safe grounds for such criminal or civil
action as might be deemed advisable.
It is not intended that this requisi
tion shall prevent in any way investi
gations by grand jury or otherwise
hat you or any of you might feel
>bliged to make in your county or
ounties. It is only intended to as
ertain from these reports the extent
>f the fraud, if any, whether sporadic
general, as only in this manner it
leems can the real seriousness of the
lituation be adequately determined.
Please give this matter your im
mediate attention.
With personal regards, I am,
Yours sincerely,
; J. H. PETERSON,
Attorney General.
CALDWELL WINS IN
LOOSELY PLAYED GAME
In what proved to be the most
loosely played game of the season,
Caldwell defeated Nampa on their
wn gridiron last Saturday afternoon
with a score of 32 to 0. The Caldwell
earn was very badly crippled on ac
:ount of having some of the best men
>ut of the game due to injuries and
ineligibility. Cook, who has been
itarring for Caldwell this season, )yas
tnable to play on account of being
Jack in his work, due to absences the
tarly part of the week.
The Nampa eleven showed up very
much stronger in their defensive play
ing than in their offensive, and at
times they held the Caldwell eleven
to a standstill. The Caldwell back
field was very slow in getting off and
Dnly occasionally did they show the
old driving power of the intact team.
Ted Turner was in the back field for
he first time since the opening game
f the season, and his enthusiasm lent
nsiderably to the support of the
earn.
All of the scoring took place dur
ing the first half of the game. During
he last half Nampa took a decided
irace and while they were unable to
dvance the ball many times with suc
ess when they secured it, yet they
revented Caldwell from making any
ecisivc gains. During the last few
inutes of play Nampa secured the
ill and marched straight down the
eld within striking distance of the
aldwell goal, and it seemed that only
e calling of time prevented them
om scoring. During the last half
[early all of the Caldwell team con
sted of substitute players, giving as
any of the substitutes as possible
opportunity to get into the game,
hile the team was materially weak
ed by doing this, yet several of the
experienced players showed up ex
llently in their first attempt in a
al game. During the last quarter
ed Madden received quite a serious
ury to his ankle and has been forced
use crutches all this week. It is
ped, however, that he may have an
rly recovery and be back into the
me again, as his loss would mean a
cided hole in the Caldwell team.
Emmett Plays Here Saturday,
he Emmett high school team will
et the Caldwell eleven at Recrea
Park an Saturday afternoon at
-'clock. While this not a league
ie n yet there is considerable in
est »connected with it, as Emmett
ires to be able to score decisively
to
on the Caldwell eleven.

Miss Anna Matson, tne head of the
Latn Department of the high school,

MARY
PICKFORD
GIRL
A DUTCH
Starred by Famous Players in "Hulda
From Holland."
Mary Pickford in wooden shoes!
Clumping and bumping about the Fa
mous Players studio, the celebrated
little star was a delightful and amus
ing sight, but not so uproariously
funny as she will be on the screen
of the Huree Theatre when she ap
pears in the Famous Players produc
tion "Hulda From Holland," by Edith
Barnard Delano, which is to be the
Paramount feature next Monday—one
day only.
Fot the scenes in this fascinating
combination of comedy and pathos
which transpire in Holland, the pro
ducers erected a complete Dutch^vil
lage and transported hundreds of "vil
lagers" to the spot where several days
were consumed in photographing the
action. When Hulda and her three
little brothers leave Holland and come
to America the action is transferred
to Pannsylvania where Hulda's uncle
resides. Of course he is a typical
Pennsylvania Dutchman and there is
only one place where they are to be
found. So John B. O'Brien, who di
rected the production for the Famous
Players, took his company to the
heart of the Pennsylvania Dutch
country in order to get just the proper
flavor.
a
is
a
at
Those who are accustomed to con
nect the name of Mary Pickford with
delicate comedy and real pathos will
not be disappointed when the popular
favorite appears in "Hulda From Hol
land," for this delightful romantic
comedy-drama embodies all the heart
appeal for which Miss Pickford is cele
brated. But it is all dressed up in a
new form of presentation and in a new
guise that is so original in treatment
that even those who have seen the
star in every one of her great success
es will find much that is new and
more that is irresistible in this pro
duction.
Little Hulda is left in sole charge of
lier three little brothers by the death
of her parents, and she finds it hard
work to keep their little Holland home
together. Finally word comes from
her wealthy uncle in Pennsylvania
that he will be glad to have them
make their home with him.
Hulda and the children are met in
New York bv the uncle but he'is in
jured and taken to a hospital, where
he remains unidentified and Hulda
finds herself alone in New York. But
a kindly landlady comes to her assist
ance until cha.nee and a broken^ sky
light 'bring her in contact with ;
young artist. Uncle Peter-s accident
is as big a blow to a wealthy railroad
president as it is to Hulda, for the
man has been trying to force Uncle
Peter to sell him a right of way
through his property and the disap
pearance of the old man makes the
consummation of the deal impcissoble.
But the young artist comes into the
story again and has a remarkable ef
fect on the ultimate outcome of the
story.
Mrs. W. H. Davis of Deer Flat left
last evening for San Gabriel, Calif.,
where she will spend the winter with
her daughter, Mrs. Edna Chaney. Mr
Davis will follow in a few weeks.

At the present time the board of
directors and tne settlers are con
vinced mat a chenge in tne organiza
tion is not wise.
Judge King's Plea.
Judge Will R. Iving, chief counsel
of tne Reclamation öervice, was in
Caldwell recently as stated in the last
issue ot lhe tribune and more fully
discussed elsewhere in this issue. The
water users understand irom the re
niarKS oi Judge King in this city that
formal announcement of the cost of
water rignts on this project will be
withheld until after the annual mat
ing oi the stockholders, it is be
lieved that the Keclamation Service
may announce two costs—one of the
project as it stands today, and the
other of the project as it will stand if
an irrigation district is organized.
In his talk in Caldwell last week
Judge King said the cost of water
rights now stood between $78 and $80.
He explained that with more lands
taken in under the district plan the
cost per acre should be reduced from
$10 to $12. Whether or not any more
definite figures on either of the alter
native plans will be made known be
fore the annual meeting remains to
be seen.
Kesl Claim Refused.
The request of S. F. Kesl for relief
because of the submerging of the only
roadway by which he can travel from
his ranch at the head of Arrowrock
reservoir to the outside world was,
after keen discussion, "pigeon-holed."
Kesl's claim has been before the di
rectors many times in the past, lo
the committee which recently made
an investigation of the matter he had
evinced a willingness to accept $2500
as recompense for the blocking of the
roadway, but indicated that he would
sue for at least $5000 more to cover
outlays he claims to have made and
the lowering of the value of his lands
by the isolation brought about. It is
expected that Mr. Kesl will, take his
claim into court.
To adjudicate claims for rebates
which may be made by owners of por
ous lands, who must use an unusual
amount of water in irrigating, mem
bership of what is to be known as the
"sandy land" committee was arranged.
The members selected are Chairman
G. H. Keim, V. V. Sparks and C. F.
Oellien. With this committee will
also serve a representative of the re
clamation office in Boise. Under the
rulings of the service, a settler who
uses more than $2 worth of water per
acre in a season is entitled to a re
bate.
The Forward Club.
The Forward Club held its regular
meeting at the club rooms on Tues
day, November 14th. The names of
two new members were reported, Mrs.
Fritz Miller and Mj*s. Fields. The
library committee invited the ladies
of the club and any guests they might
wish to take, to a Christmas Kensing
ton to be given at the club rooms on
November 23rd, at 2:30 o'clock. A
delightful program has been arranged
and refreshments will be served. A
charge of 25 cents will be made and
everyone is cordially invited to come
After the regular business meeting
came one of the most instructive and
interesting talks in the history of the
club. Qr. Gue and Dr. Cole gave a
lecture and démonstration of First
Aids, assisted by two small boys, who
were variously afflicted with severe
cuts and broken legs, were drowned,
etc. The doctors exhibted an emer
gency kit which every household
should contain, and by its use showed
the first needful things to do for cuts,
burns and scalds, fainting, fractures
and dislocations, punctured wounds
drowning and snake-bite, and in ad
dition answered many questions.
The next meeting is President's
Day and a most interesting program
has been prepared.

weaves into one the lives of three
persons, deals with mining conditions
in the great west.
A relentless fate seems to pursue
Bruce Burt, the part played by Wil

tranged for many years. Not until
then does he realize the ha
happiness that j
he has deserved trom the tirst. I
Bruce Burt (.William Farnum) and I
"Slim" Naurian (.Charles W hittakcr), |
partners oil a prospecting trip, agree
to work the small sand bars along the
river in the Bitter Roots, and share
alike in profits. Bruce works con
scientiously, but "Slim" shirks and
spends his time hunting big game in
tne mountains. As the pile of gold
dust grows, "Slim" deliberately picks
a quarrel with Bruce, with the object
of killing him and obtaining posses
sion of the gold
Bruce kills "Slim'
in self defense
When he looks through "Slim's"
effects, Bruce finds a letter written
twelve years before, by "Slim's"
sister. Bruce decides to find her and
give her half his own gold dust,
making her bleive it is "Slim's."
Before he has a chance to go in
search of her, Victor Spudell (H. A.
Sparrows), of Indiana, on a shooting
trip with a guide, stumbles into his
cabin, in the midst of a terrible bliz
zard. Sprudell tells Bruce that he
has left his Chinese cook, ill, in a
cabin. Fearing that he may become a
victim of the storm, Bruce tells Spru
dell .about "Slim's" sister and asks
him to find her and give her the gold
dust if he doesn't come back.
Bruce does not reutrn. Sprudell
goes home to Indiana, prepared to
float the Bitter Root Mining Co. with
himself as president. The "Dis
path" sends Helen Dunbar (Betty
Schade), a woman reporter to inter
view him. When he tells his story,
distorted as it is, Helen discovers that
"Slim" is her half brother from whom
she has not heard for years.
Sprudell gives her five hundred
dollars, telling her that is what her
brother left. In the midst of a large
...ceting of backers who are to float
his company, Sprudell is astounded
to have Bruce's card brought in to
him. Knowing that Bruce has not
recorded his claim Sprudell double
crosses him and denies his prior
rights.
Bruce, without sufficient money to
fight him in court, obtains water
rights and controls the situation. He
tries to raise money, but is unsuccess
ful. Finally, in return for whipping
a man who has bested Winfield Har
rah (Willard Louis), a sport-loving
financier, in an encounter, Bruce ob
tains the money. He and Helen meet
just after Sprudell has proposed to
her. Bruce tells her the truth about
"Slim." He and she go into partner
ship and fight Sprudell.
Bruce builds his plant. Just as it
is completed, it starts to burn. Bruce
phones to order Schmaltz, who is in
charge of the plant, to shut down the
power. No answer. Bruce starts
across the river to try to save
Schmaltz from certain death. He
finds him with his hands in his
pockets, watching the place burn.
Schmaltz confesses that he has been
id by Sprudell to destroy the plant
The plant is destroyed. The backers
refuse to put up more money. Dis
couraged and heartsick Bruce writes
his failure to Helen, his little
partner.
As a great sacrifice, Helen goes to
Bruce's father, a wealthy ranchman,
from whom he has been estranged.
Through her father and son become
reconciled. The three find happiness
and good fortune in the Bitter Roots.

White declared Ulis his company was
endeavoring to give a uniform con
tract to ail the cities on the circuit
and stated that in line with this policy
it would be impossible to give Cald
well the concessions granted by their
representative last summer. A mo
tion to enter into a contract with Mr.
White under the terms outlined by
him was tabled until the next regular
meeting. 1 he company was, however,
granted the privilege of contracting

The annual grist of tax notices will
be sent out by the county treasurer in
a week or ten days, as work on the
rolls is progressing nicely. Mrs.
Handy reports rather more than the
usual number of taxpayers who have
sidestepped the notices and cheedfully
volunteered payment of the govern
ment's exaction, handing over the tax
in full in nearly every instance. Demo
crats are hailing this as a proof of the
success of the prevailing administra
tion, while Republicans claim it as the
result of the near-Republican victory.
The property owner who happens to
