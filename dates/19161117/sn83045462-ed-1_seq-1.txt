LONDON, November 17.?The Rumanians
have suffered further reverses at
the hands of Gen. von Falkenhayn's in- 1
vading forces, according: to today's official
announcement by the German war office, j
Taking a total of more than 2.100 pris- |
oners and a dozen machine guns, the {
Teutonic forces in yesterday's operations
carried with the bayonet the summit
of Rungul mountain, on the Moldavian
frontier of Rumania east of Kedzivasarhely;
penetrated a Rumanian position in
the Pretleal region and scored advances
south of Rothenthuru pass, the statement
asserts. j
Apparently the Russians are holding
their own well along the northern part
of the Moldavian boundary line. Berlin j
reports them withstanding the Austro- !
German attacks.
The capture by the Austro-Hungarian '
forces, which are invading Rumania of ;
the village of Liresht, in the Campulung j

in Washington, I'resident Wilson
did not tiir;e up with his advisers
at the cabinet meeting; today the proposal
to grant a year-round half holiday,
about which he had asked each of
them to write him their recommendation.
Cabinet members, after leaving the
meeting, said that they have no idea
when the President will get to the
Saturday half-holiday proposition.
It is known that the cabinet is
practically a unit in favor of granting
this extension of the half holidnv
throughout the entire year.

) NEW TX'NDOX, Conn.. November 1".
j ?Five lives were lost when the German .
j submarine Deutschland, which left port 1
| parly today for Bremen, rammed and sent 1
; to the bottom, with its crew of live, the ]
tug T. A. Scott, jr., one of its two con- ;
voying tugs. After the accident the j
Peutschland returned to port. The dead: <
Capt. John (lurncy, William A. Caton,
engineer; Edward Stone, fireman; Ciar- ,
ence ?3. Davidson, cook, and Eugene I)u- ,
zant, deckhand. ;
The collision occurred about a miie in- j
side the Race, and, according- to a mem- ^
ber of the Deutschland's crew, "came all
in a minute." The tug, he said, got unexpectedly
in front of the Deutschland. the
distance being so slight between them that j J
the submersible had no chance of avoidI
ing the accident. Her nose struck the *
tug near the stern, lifting it well out of ]
the water and sending the Scott's nose
under. Almost immediately afterward the
boilers of the tug exploded and the vessel 1
sank with all on board. Capt. Fred ]
Hinsch of the interned German steamer
Neckar. who was on the tug. grasped a
guy rope and was drawn down with the . *
tug. When he rose to the surface he I :
managed to grasp a life preserver which ,
nan been thrown out by the Deutschland
and was taken on board the vessel, by
which he was brought back to New London.
The Deutschland was not seriously
damaged, it was stated, and would
probably be ready to sail in a fewdays,
when repairs had been made.
Several of the bow plates w ere bent !
and the rivets loosened, but the in-,
terior of the submarine was not dam- '
aged. The repairs will be made by
members of the crew.
Officials declined to discuss the accident.
Vice president Paul G. Jlilken of the
Eastern Forwarding Company. American
agents for the undersea line, said
today That a statement would be issued
by the company, probably tonight,
as soon as it was in possession of full
information. He added:
"The drowning of the crew of the
tug T. A. Scott, jr.. is a much regrettable
occurrence, and none feels it more
keenly than the officials of the Forwarding
Company and the officers and
men of the Deutschland. That it was
unavoidable goes without saying."
Eddy Caused the Accident.
An "eddj" c%u?e<l the accident, ac- J
cording to Cipt. harry Baker of the
tnc Cassie. the other convover of the
submarine. Tift Cassie was traveling:
about half a mile astern of the
Deutechland. .while the ?cott and the
submarine were moving about abreast.
The sea was calm, Ca.pt. Baker said,
and conditions were normal.
The Scott Carried the usual lights,
but the Deutschland had only her headlight
and tv. o side lights. The tide was
running almost full, and when about
seveu miles west of Race rock they
struck an "eddy" which twisted them
about and out of control. Shortly afterward
they came together. He heard
the crash. The night was clear, he
said, and there were no boats other
than the two tugs and the submarine
Deutuchland In the vicinity. He gave
no credence to reports that a hostile
motor boat was approaching the submarine
at the time of the accident.
Capt. Baker said that when the collision
occurred he at or.ee headed for j
the spot. On arriving there ho saw !
Oapt. Hir.fcch in the water and took j
him on board the Cassie. Earlier re- j
ports had it that Hinsch had been res- i
cued by the Oeutschland.
May Be Ready to Leave ia Few Day= |
Henry *. Ililken of Baltimore, president
of the Eastern Forwarding: Company,
paid that so far as he knew the
only damage the Deutsciiland suffered
i was a twisted stem. It was learned i
later, however, that the undersea boat
has in her bow at least one hole about
twepty inches 'square. A portable
forge was taken down to the pier and
the hole is being patched up.
Capt. W. A. Fones, shore superintendent
of the Scott Company in charge of
the repairs, said he expected that the i
Deutschland would be ready to leave (
within two or three days. Reports that
a C boat with gun mounted was wait- 1
ing outside the three-mile limit, sup- ]
posed ly t?> convoy the Deutschland, ,
failed of confirmation here.
i
Capt. Koenig Pale and Shaken.
apt. Koenig of the Deutschland appeared
pale and shaken ns he stepped
ashore from his vessel on its return. '
He refused to talk about the collision
end immediately sent word to Vice '
President Paul ?1. Hilken of the Fast- '
t ern Forwarding Company, who arrived 1
at the company's offices shortly afterward
a d went into consultation !
with him.
In the absence of authoritative information
considerable speculation as
to the cnus?? of the accident was current.
Among shipping men the opinion
j was expressed that, the steering gear
[of the submersible may have been at
j fault, causing her to run squarely into
i the convoying tug. The fact that the
i tug sank almost immediately after
being struck was taken to indicate that
the blow must have been a powerful
one and must have corne with unexpected
suddenness.
Left Her Pier at 1 :30 A.M.
The Deutschland drew out of her pocket
at the pier of the Kastern Forwarding
Company at 1:30 o'clock this morning,
accompanied by the tugs T. A. Scott and
i the Caasie 01 uic x ncwu recaing
company, sub-agents of the Kastern Forwarding
Company. She carried on her
homeward dash a cargo valued at 12,000.U00,
and consisting of nickel, rubber and
silver bars.
The trip down the harbor whs without
incident and when last seen by a newspaper
launch the submersible was plowing
through a smooth sea at the rate of
twelve knots an hour, headed for Montauk
point. The newspaper launch returned
here after following the submarine
several miles. At that time the sea
was smooth, and the moon in its last
quarter cast its rays over the water.
Failure of the tugs to return at an
early hour led to much speculation, but
It was believed that they would accompany
the submersible well beyond Jfhc
three-mile limit.
Her Departure Unexpected.
Although the Deutschland apparentlyhad
been ready for her dash for some
days her departure was rather unexpected.

HOLDS RIGHT TO QUIT WORK
By tLe Associated Press.
BALTIMORE. Md.f November 17.?The
American Federation of Labor by a
unanimous vote today declared against
Lhat provision of President Wilson's
legislative program "making illegal ,
my railroad strike or lockout prior to j
Li.- ? r.c v, Oia !

The committee report, which was ,

rention take an unequivocal position
igainst compulsory institutions and in |
favor of the maintenance of institu- j
;ioiis and opportunities for freedom. )
The convention had before it that
section of the executive council's report
dealing- with the railroad brotherhood's
threatened strike. It referred
:o the biil introduced in Congress for
he purpose of preventing strikes and
nterruptions of transportation, modeled
after the Canadian compulsory investigations

'To their declarations against
nvoluntary servitude the proponents of
he legislation have replied that, alIiough
a strike would be made illegal
mder the proposed law and strikers i
sriminals, yet individual workers were'
lot deprived of the right to quit work.
"It is pure sophistry that only aug- j
nents the sense of injustice that wage '
earners may feel for industrial wrongs !
o allow them by law the right of in- '
livlduals to quit work and to declare;
hat they cannot agree with fellow j
vorkers that conditions are so bad that j
heir only hope of justice and fair deal- j
rig lies in agreeing together to quit '

NOEARLY RESTPEID
FOR PRESIDENT WILSON:
Executive Not to Leave Washington I
for Protracted Stay Owing to
Public Business.
President Wilson will not leave j
Washington for a rest, an urged by his j
friends. He may take some week end
trips on the Mayflower, but he lias no
intention of taking a prolonged rest.
He has too much to do, thinks, to
waste time; that way. He has begun j
work upon his annual address to Con- j
grese. which must be completed by the j
time that body convenes for the short I
session. He has three important commissions
to name and is giving considerable
thonght to them. He hopes
to be able to announce the tariff board
v. ithin a short time and shortly nfler
that the shipping commission. The
board to put into effect the new com- !
pensation law will be made known in I
the course of tir^e, but probably v. ill j
be the last of the three bodies to be selected.
Both Carefully Considered.
The President has j^iven much
thought to the tariff and shipping
boards for weeks, and is very anxious
to have the personnel of each made
up of the highest class of men possible
to get for the salaries that will be
paid.
The President, met with his cabinet,
today for the first time In nearly two
months. A number of departmental
matters were taken up. The meeting
was a short one, owing to an appointment
the President had with Chairman
McCormick and Vice Chairman Cummins
of the democratic national committee.
at which a number of matters
were taken up. j

PETROGRAD, November 17.?The
minister of foreign affairs has sent a
telegram to all Russian representatives
in allied countries declaring Russia's
iirm determination not to make a separate
peace under any circumstances,
according to the semi-official news
agency. The text of the telegram is as
follows: ?
"Petro&rad, November 1C, 191t?.?Reports
spread abroad recently by the 1]
press of certain countries of pretended
secret pourparlers being carried on between
Russia and Germany with the ^
object of signing a separate peace are
futile and make no impression on the
Russian government. The imperial government
desires to declare in the most ?
categorical manner that these abgurd f,
rumors can only find force in 4/liemy c,
countries. i<
"Russia will maintain intact the in- tl
timate union which binds her to her u
valiant allies, and. far from thinking 0
of the conclusion of a separate peace, n
will flght by their side the common en- j;
emy without the slightest faltering un- 0
til the hour of final victory. Nothing 0
that our enemies can do will shake in
any degree the irrevocable decision of '
Russia.

Republicans face
MEM IN HOUSE
Ability to Elect Speaker and
Organize Body May Depend
on Policy Pledges.
OLD SYSTEM IS OPPOSED
In democratic congressional circle?
here it is said that even should the
republicans have a nominal majority
in the House of Representatives
their ability to elect a Speaker
and organize the House will depend
upon a contingent, namely, their
policy toward the appointment of committees
and the character of the rules
they propose to adopt. It is believed by
the democrats that assurances upon these
points will be demanded in advance by republicans
sufficient in ^number to dictate
the election of a republican Speaker, or, as
a last resort, to give the ofganization of
the House to the democrats.
In the republican membership there
are a number of men who fought the
old Cannon regime, and who are assumed
to be as bitterly opposed to
methods criticised as dictatorial as
they were then. It also is assumed
that among the new members from th?
west will be found republicans who are
in sympathy with this element. Assuming
that they would be. loath to organize
the House for the democrats. It
is thought to be certain that they will
not permit the new House to b** organized
by the extremists of the old guard.
Point Still Is in Doubt.
; The natural assumption amung pvn]
ticlans is that the leading spirits
! among- the republicans will favor rc!
storing- to the Speaker the power to
| appoint committees, as was the custom
j before the overturn which resulted in
l the adoption of the method now in
| vogue, the naming of committees by a
j committee on committees. No one can
i speak definitely as yet. upon this point.
since there have been no conference of
j sinee there have been no conferences of
| guiding councils of the republican parj
ty in the House.
j The prospective attitude of the opposj
ing faction has not been voiced, either,
I but its record in the past is known.
| and there is no reason to suppose that
| it has changed its position. There
is almost a year in which to thresh out
this subject before the question comes
to issue, and it will be the main consideration
un the republican councils
from now on.
The democrats are counting heavily
upon this prospective feud in the republican
party, and while they scarcely
dare hope that it will in the end give
them control of the House, they feel
sure it will cause the republicans a lot
of trouble and at least result in a more
liberal policy, which will give the minority
more scope.
T, M. OSBORNE TO STUDY
NAVY PRISON CONDITIONS
Will Undertake Investigation to
Recommend Reforms. Secretary
Daniels Announces.
Secretary Daniels announced today!
that Thomas Mott Osborne, former
warden of Sing Sing prison. New York,
had undertaken to study prison conditions
in the navy, with a view of rec- j
ommending a reformed system of
prison administration. Mr. Osborne
agreed to make the study by request
of the Secretary, who Is desirous of
applying reform methods in the handling
and treatment of prisoners at the
navy stations.
"There has been a gradual lessening
of the more severe punishments of
navy prisoners going on for some
time." the Secretary said. "Penalties
for over-stay of leave and like violations
of regulations have been reduced
and the men given the opportunity to
make reparation for misdeameanors

Maj. Gen. F. C. Maurice, chief director
of military operations at the war oflice.
in an interview with the Associated
Press, predicted that the British
gains in the Ancre valley were only
the forerunner of further equally Important
advances which will be made
on the western front during the winter
months. .
"Our success on the Ancre," said Gen. '
Maurice, "means that we're not going
to give the enemy much rest this
winter. Jt means that whenever
weather conditions permit we are going
to attack and subject the enemy
to unceasing pressure during the coming
months, so as to prevent as far
as possible the Germans from establishing
themselves in new positions.
Important Advantage Gained.
| "All the attempts of the enemy to
minimize our tucuehs Will IIOL
away the fact that in three days the
British troops, by the capture of Beau- |
moat and St. Pierre Pivion and the
semi-circular ridge they dominated,
have gained an important strategical
! advantage. This ridge formed a salient

ern bank of the Anere. Thus, the enei

"Our troops advanced front below
through sticky white chalk, and a network
of defenses. They gained the
ridge and forced the enemy back across
the valley to the next hill. As a result
we dominate tho situation in this territory
and are consolidating the positions
for further activities."
