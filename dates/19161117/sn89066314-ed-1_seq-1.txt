''The recent experience of the In
diana Centennial Committee," said
Colonel R. M. White, "which had only
eighteen months to finish its labors In
1916, will not be repeated in Missouri.
The story of Missouri is a valuable
and fascinating tale in the annals of
America. Her Influence on the na
tion Is pictured by Benton, Barton,
Doniphan, Blair and Schurz; her place
In literature is made secure y a Mark
Twain and a Eugene Field; her pio
neers so largely settled the West that
she may be called the 'Mother of the
West:; her struggle for statehood was
most Important in the history of the
country.
Celebrations to Be Planned.
"Statewide celebrations, county cele
brations historical pageants, litera
ture appropriate to the occasion all
these must .be planned by the. Cen
tennial Committee."
In "An Address to the People of
Missouri Concerning the Celebration
of the Centennial ot the State," just
published by the State Historical So
ciety, W. B. Stevens of St. Louis calls
attention to the events from 1817 to
1821 in Missouri's struggle for state
hood, upon which will be based Mis
souri's Centennial Celebration.
"As early as the fall ot 1817 popular
petitions for statehood were circulated
and signed by Missourians," says Mr.
Stevens. "These petitions were pre
sented to Congress on January 8, 1818.
After a long discussion and a deadlock
Enabling Act was passed March 6,
between the two houses, the Missouri
1820. Conforming to the provisions of
this act, a convention was held and a
constitution adopted, taking full effect
on July 19, 1820. vt-
"State Was First de Facto."
"To begin, Missouri was a de facto
state, it elected state officers, had a
legislature, chose representatives In
"Congress, created a code, organized
counties all of which performed their
proper functions. Congress, however,
delayed recognition, while statesman
quibbled over the compromise on the
slavery question. President Monroe's
Proclamation was Issued August 21,
1821, when Missouri had been a state
tor more than a year. The proclama
tion did not question the condition of
statehood which had been In existence.
It merely announced with the brief
est formality, 'the admission of the
Mid state of Missouri Into the Union
to be complete."
"Commenting upon this condition,
the first governor of the state, Mc
Nalr said in his message to the leg
islature, 'since the organization of
this government we have exhibited to
the American people a spectacle novel

Commercial Club Trustees
Will Turn Property Over
to Shoe Company.
The board of directors of the Com
mercial Club and the trustees, having
charge of the Hamilton-Brown shoe
factory building will meet in joint
session tonight to make final disposi
tion of the contract now existing be
tween the Commercial Club and the
Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company.
The building now occupied by the
shoe company was built 'ten year ago.
A contract was made between the
company and the Commercial Club
which stipulated, that if the company
maintained a factory there for ten
years, it would be given a trustee's
deed to the property. The ten-year
period was up October 15. The deed
will be transferred to the company
soon. Victor Jones, secretary of the
Commercial Club, said today there
was no evident reason why the deed
shouldn't be given to the company.
He said it had fulfilled its part of the
contract.
The board of trustees in charge of
the matter are: E. W. Stephens, chair
man; R. B. Price, Sr., C. B. Bowling,
S. C. Hunt and H. H. Banks.
"The cost of the building was about
$60,000," said Mr. Jones tocfay. "The
shoe company has had no rent to pay
since It has occupied the building. Its
only expense has been the paymrnr ot
taxes and repairs."
"For the first time in three jears
the factory is now on a paying basis,"
said " C. 13. Ross, generar super
intendent of the Hamilton-Brown
Shoe Company. The building has re
cently been thoroughly renovated. W.
H. Brase'.ton Is the superintendent.
"COURTESY NEEDED IJf TW

J. H. Harkless,1 "President ' of the
Missouri JBar .Association, in his lec
ture to" the student's in the School of
Law this afternoon, urged them to be
respectful and courteous to lawyers,
courts and witnesses. He advised them
to get out and meet, people, and to get

"I have no use' he said, "for the
persons and newspapers who are
continually' speaking disrespectfully
of our courts arid lawyers.
"The purpose;of the bar iocia
tions all oyer the country," he ex
plained, "is to simplify the law, to
wipe out the cumbersome parts of the
procedure during a trial, to educate
the lawyer to high ideals of justice, to
get the state and lawyers together to

EXPECTS MONASTIR'S
FALL WITHIN 3
London Announces the Allies
Continue Advance in Snow,

2 TOWNS CAPTURED
Teutonic Defenders Forced

Enveloping Moves."
By United Tress
LONDON. Nov. 17. The fall of Mon
astir uithin three days was confident
ly predicted here this afternoon with
reports of the victorious French pro
gress toward the Macedonian city.
The Allied forces are fighting through
snow, sleet and mud. French, Rus
sian and Serbian forces have swung
forward in a flanking movement of
gigantic magnitude and have made a
vise-like grip of the Monastir neigh
borhood. Dispatches from Salonlki said the
Serbians had occupied the towns of
Kenali and Mesozioll in their advanc
es toward Monastir. Both cities are
several miles below the line of ad
vance. It may be that the Allies ad
vanced around the towns and left for
mal occupation until a later time.
General Serrail refused to be drawn
into an attack of the Bulgarian de
fenses south of Monastir and, accord
ing to all reports, has forced the re
tirement of the .Bulgarian-Teutonic
defenders from these positions with
hardly a blow. This was accomplished
by threats of strong enveloping move
ments. WIS ABOUT 1TH MO,

C. II. S. DEFEATS IT. H. S, 19 TO 0
Two Touchdowns Scored on Forward
Passes Rutledge Stars.
Columbia High defeated University
High in football today 19 to 0, scoring
in the first, third and fourth quarters.
The last two touchdowns came on for
ward passes, Sapp and Tucker, a sub
stitute, being on the receiving end.
Columbia High School put over
one .touchdown in the first' quarter
this afternoon when Rutledge, half
back, placed the ball on the 3-yard
line by a 30-yard run and a moment
later carried it over. The goal was
not kicked. 'The Kewpies could not
score in the second quarter and the
half ended with them leading, 6 to 0.
The game decides the high school
championship of Columbia. Both elev
ens were In good condition and the in
tense rivalry existing between the
schools 'forecast a fast contest The
Kewpies outweighed the Preps fifteen
pounds to the man, but the light Uni
versity High backfleld was fast and
shifty. Coach Selbie of the Preps
pinned his hope of victory to an aerial
attack, while the Kewpies depended
chiefly upon straight football to win
for them. Charles Woody refereed,

An
attempted dash to sea by the, Ger

collision between tbe submersible and
an escorting tug in which the captain
and four members of the tug's .-'crew
lost their lives. The Deutschland was
bound for Bremen, but returned to
port immediately after the collision.
tVork was begun at once by a small
army of workmen to learn the extent
of damage as a result of this the sec

and cold, by sailors from the Deutsch
land, who leaped overboard and drag

Accident Caused by Darkness.
It is said by sailors that the current
was unusually strong. Because of this
and the darkness, the Deutschland's
lookout did not see the Scott soon
enough to sound an alarm. All lights
that had not been extinguished were
shaded in order to make escape for
the Deutschland easier. This added to
the difficulty in keeping the distance
between the boats. The accident hap
pened about 2 o'clock.
In a query at the pier of (the
Eastern Forwarding Company, the
Deutschland's owner, brought no con
firmation of the rumor that a motor
boat had tried to ram the Deutschland
and that In attempting to protect the
submarine the Scott swung in front of
the undersea freighter.
Since the Deutschland came back
here under her own power. It Is not
belieed she sustained serious dam
age. A hurried examination led the
officers to believe that she will be
ready again in a few days. Her cargo
included .$2,000,000 worth of rubber,
nickel, zinc, and sliver, as well as sev
eral sacks 'of mail from the German
embassy at Washington.

The bicycle incident was included In
the concessions that Ora Lewis gave
the police after he was brought to, St
Louis from Kansas City, it Is" charged:
It was apparent today in the line of
cross-questioning that the defense
would base much hope on the attempt
to show that the witness had been
cautioned and coached through the
circuit attorney's office. When Fish
was cross-questioned, he was asked
how he remembered the date. He said
his father reminded him of It
Ned Holt of Mexico also took the
stand and said he saw two automo
biles, one large and one small, as he
drove along a road parallel to unused
street railway tracks, where Lewis is
accused of stealing wire. He said
there was a man in each machine,
and that they had moved about fifty
feet when he passed 'there later on a
return trip.
"My wagon was loaded when I pass
ed the first time," Holt said on cross
examination. "Did you say you were loaded?" At
torney Weiss asked sarcastically.
"I took occasion to reprimand you
Thursday for heckling your witness
es," said Judge Grimm. "You shall
respect the court and refrain from
such conduct If you want to know if
he was drunk, ask bim!"
The courtroom was swept by gales
of laughter when Weiss asked Holt
this question, "Have you drunVany?"
He received the reply. "Yes, water."

ON SATURDAY'S GAME
Tigers Suffer by Comparison
on Basis of Scores Made
Against Washington.
BULLDOG PICKING UP
Injuries to Missouri Eleven
Make Difference No Io
wa Victory Since 1903.
Those who think the Drake game
here tomorrow Is going to-prove easy
picking for the Tigers should take an
other glance at the fieures. which, al
though somewhat unreliable at the
best, still furnish a basls.for compari
son and must never be overlooked.
The only direct line ot comparison
between the teams which will meet on
Rollins Field Saturday favors the Iowa
team. Drake beat Washington by the
same score in St. Louis as the Tigers
won by on Rollins Field. Starting
with this advantage, the Des Moines
team has steadily improved, while It
is now known that Missouri was in
top form for the early game with
Washington and has improved little
Since that contest.
LFive hard games in a row have also
ndicapped the Tigers, both in regard
to injuries and in general play, for
Bchulte's men had been counting on a
let-down after the Kansas Aggie game,
and now it appears that they must be
at top speed for both the Drake and
Kansas games.
Drake Has Veteran Backfleld.
Drake came to Columbia today with
four of the men who appeared against
Missouri last year. They are Sprang,
all-valley center; Warnock, tackle;
Thomas, halfback, and Blackburn, full
back. In addition, Jernegan, a back
fleld man, and Smith, captain and half-
hack, both of whom were out of the
game last season because ot Injuries,
will appear Saturday. This gives
Drake a veteran backfleld and two
tried men In the line.
".Brake's football squad, eighteen
men In all, were on Rollins Field this
afternoon, forward passing and kick
ing goals, preparing for tomorrow's
clash. Coach Ralph Glaze, when ask
ed what he thought the outcome of the
Bulldogs to be able to hold the Tig
game would be, said he expected his
ers to a small score. This seems to
be the favorite expression of coaches
before the game.
He said also that although the
Drake band would reach here tomor
row, he did not expect many rooters
as Columbia was too far away from
Des Moines for many to make the
trip.
Missouri Won Last Six Games.
These two schools have met on the
gridiron nine times previous to this
season. For the1 first three games,
Drake 'had a clean record ot not hav
ing been scored on, but'since 1903 the
Bulldogs have never vanquished a Mis
souri eleven. The Tigers have blanked
the Iowa team only once in these six
games,1 however. The scores followr
