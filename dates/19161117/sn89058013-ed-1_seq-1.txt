LINCOLN-LEE '
LEGION EVENT
The World's Temperance San
day was observed, at the M. E.
Church, South, Sunday eveuiug.
The splendid program followed
that arranged by the Liucoln
Xiee Legion, with special reference
to the Sunday school's part in the
great campaign, for nation-wide
prohibition".
.In a short talk Superintendent
TJ, A. Potts set forth the duty of
every citizen in his relation to the
movement to make the United
States a saloonless nation.
- Two charts, contrasting the wet
and dry maps of the United States
in 1893 and 1910, afforded the
speaker a splendid basis for an
exhortation, showing that jnbt as
eoon as nil Christians take suffi
cient interest in the public welfare
and vote as Christians should
especially for .Congressmen and
.Assemblymen our map will then
"become white. About 75 per cent
is of the land area is already white.
The Loyal Temperance Legion
of the local union of the Woman's
Ohristian Temperance iUnion took
part in the program, which waB
"well rendered end was made very
impressive with appropriate songs
nd readings. Nearly all pledge
vcards passed through the audience
"were signed, and the offering was
liberal one.
PROHIBITION STATES.
Six States eliminated the saloon
.- an1 the election of last Tuesday,
J?our of them put whisky .out on a
straight appeal to the voters.
' IThese are Michigan, Nebraska,
South Dakota and New Mexico.
, TTwo Florida and Utah elected
' 'Governors and General Assemblies
pledged to prohibition laws.
The addition of these six States
snakes a total of twenty-six 'dry"
States. Numerically, that ismore
than half of the 'United States.
Territorially it is more than two
thirds of the' United States, for
nany of the "dry" States are terri
' - ttorially large. So far as represen
tation in Congress goes, the twenty-six
dry States do not constitute
majority, but they approach it
"very-closely and victory is neces
cary in only a few more States to
xnake the nation preponderantly
dry.'t-:r-,. : 9zf
The States that haid already
-eliminated whisky are: Maine,
Sansas, West Virginia, Virginia,
3Sforth Carolina, South Carolina,
Oeorgia, Mississippi, Tennessee,
Alabama, Arkansas, North Dakota,
Oklahoma, Montana, Idaho, Colo
xado, Arizona, Oregon aud Wash-
i ' 'ington. . '
, Bather queerly, the "dry" terri
tory coincides pretty closely with
Hhe Democratic territory as made
jp in the election of Tuesday.
tXhe solid WeBt joined the solid
Qouth, not only in the Democratic
column but in the prohibition col
umn. There are, to be sure,' a few
Western States that went Demo-
' ratio in which the saloon still
Nourishes, and there are ; a few
"Western States already "dry" that
eut RputylieW. Throughout the
rest of the country there are a few
"'dry" .Republican "States and a few
"wet" Democratic States.' .But,
roughly, Democratic territory and
rrohjbitiou territory coincide. In
C;oth alignments it is the South
cud West on one sideband the
dlorth on the other nide.
' That may lw r vry significant
'izL "-ii'rohibitiou will become- a
more urgent issue duriug the next
four years than it has everbeen
been before, It will demand at
tention in Congress. It will loud
ly demand attention wheu plat
forms are made in 1920. The
Democratic party is the dominant
party. Democratic territory is
prohibition territory, For the
first time in its history, the domi
nant paity owes nothing to the
"wet" north. tFor the first time in
its history the dominant party
owes vastly more to the. "dry" terri
tory than it does to the "wet" terri
tory. ) Even if (he Democratic par
ty should seek itthe way of escape
from advocating probi bition would
not be easy to find. -
Even in" 1920 prohibition as-a
national issue may not find its way
into the Democratic platform. To
make it a national party issue
might not be wise.. But, almost
inevitably the Democratic party
the dominant and still the growing
party will ' become the party of
prohibition.
A liquorless America is on its
way, and it will be no great while
in arriving. It may come in 1920,
Conceivably, it may come even be
fore that. But, it any event, it
will arrive while -many of those
who have so faithfully. pioneered
for it are still alive to see its bless
ings in operation. Tennessean.

CHIEF JUSTICE
ilATM.NKIL
Judge M. M. Neil of Trenton
who has been Chief Justice of the
Supreme Bench of Tennessee for
several, years, so impresses a Mid
dle Tennessee editor - with his de
cisions as to -bring forth a fine
tribute to the West Tennessee
jurist. ... ';,.- .. t '";'. ' "
Judge Neil is well known for his
studious habits. He had rather
work all day and night in getting
at the tap root of the facts and law
in a complicated case than to en
gage himself in any other manner,
and when the opinion is handed
down in the case it is regarded as
final indeed. : v
The Lebanon Banner pays him
the following compliment, which
is appreciated here in West Ten
nessee: -,
One of. the most -painstaking,
most accurate and most thoroughly
painstaking honest officers of the
State of Tennessee today is the
Hon. M. M. Neil, Chief Justice of
the Supreme - Court. A profound
lawyer, a conscientious- Christian
gentleman, a great big man who
fills well a great big place, While
presiding over the Impeachment
Court, Judge "Neil so favorably
impressed the members of the
General Assembly, they are ex
travagant with their compliments
of him. In the opinion of Judge
Neil in the Morgan case from this
county, wherein the Supreme Court
reversed the Court of Civil Ap
peals, the honest accuracy of a
great judicial mind is made mani
fest. This opinion bugs to the
truth of the facts in detail from
beginning to eud,-just like one of
the railroad company's trains sticks
to the track from Nashville to Har
riman. So do his other decisions.
The people of the State: of Ten
nessee are interested in men like
Judge Mat Neili V
The above clipping is from the
daily Jackson Sun. West Ten nes
seans feel a keen interest in the
splendid record of .Judge Nell as
Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, abd they appreciate the
many compliments paseed upon
him since assuming office.

DR. J. T, EDWAIIDS
RECOMMENDS IT
Prominent Georgia Physician
Now Qives flaster Medicine
Mis .-Unqualified Endorsement.
Dr. J. I Edwards of Fay ett.
villerGa., one of; the heet-kuowji
members of the medical profession '
in the State of Georgia, makes a
statement that will undoubtedly
produce a profound impression
throughout the South- ;
"In my thirty years, of active
practice as a licensed physician in
the State of :Georgia," says Dr.
Edwards, ?r'I have never seen any
thing to .equal Tanlac as a medi
cine to produce. results, I hear .
people on all sides telling of the
benefits they have derived from its
use. ' ' ; '-; y;r
"Tanlac is simply the talk of my
town. . I have no hesitaucy in re
commending the medicine; and, as .
a matter of fact. I am prescribing
i for .jny. patients almost every
day. ' mv:-., ; ' '.
'Only a few days ago a well
known woman of Fayetteville came
to me and told .me about the re
markable relief her daughter had
gained from the use of this medi
cine. She said lier daughter had
been confined to her bed for three
years with what had been pro
nounced pellagra, aud 'that after
using Tanlac for a short time she
was able to be about and was On "
the road to recovery.
"But this -is only one instance.
People in all walks of life in and
around our little city are giving
similar indorsements to the medi
cine. Seldom a day passes that
someone does not come to me and
say something about the good, re
sults they are getting from the nse .
of Tanlac. ? -
"Several unusual gains in weight
have been .'reported by some of our ;
most prominent people, and I have
treated some stubborn cases of in
digestion, catarrhal conditions and :
results with Tanlac."
Commenting . upon this state
ment, G.-F. .'Willis, Southern dia-
tributor of Taulac, saidr -
"Coming from the high source
it does and especially from a mem
ber of the medical profession, this
straightforward utterance of Dr,
Edwards is more than a recom
meudation. It is a triumph!
Tanlac, Nature's . great vegetable
tonic, corrective and system-build
er, is truly one of the greatest dis
coveries of the decade,' and the best "
evidence of 'this is the confidence
and high esteem in which it -is
held not only by the great masses
of the people, but by leaders and
public men everywhere. Nq other ,
medicine has ever established the
reputation Tanlac, nor has any
other received the high indorse
ment of medical men and laity."

Tanlac is the people's mi ell icine

made it what 'it is. People who
hae been helped by Tanlac are
always anxious and willing to tell
others about it.
