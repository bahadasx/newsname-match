THE PURPOSE OF THE
NONPARTISAN LEAGUE
The Nonpartisan league has
been completely victorious in
this election with one possible ex
ception. The vote
on
Casey, the
league's Democratic candidate
lor treasurer is still in doubt.
It also appears that the league
will have control of the next leg
islature. Now that the league has
won, what may the people ot
North Dakota expect to do That
is the interesting political ques
tion in this state today.
Discussing the program of the
league. The Nonpartisan Leader
of this week, after summarizing
the results of the election says:
"The league must stick togeth
er. The league can not stop.
When it stops it is dead. It must
not die. If it does your year of
effort is wasted and gone.
"We have learned how to fight.
We have learned how to pull to
gether. We have a fine army.
Don't let it be ruined by a partial
victory. Let us not be drunk
with success or we shall end in
disaster and uselessness.
"Now let us talk about some,
thing we ail know—something we
nil have felt but have scarcely
dared to put into words. The
league's legislative program is not
its real purpose. Let the league'sJ
enemies take these words and
i": .' the most of ii Pin. The
Jt'tiyue's pr i-nr.s 5. ot its real
purpose rather it is merely the
expression or certain immediate
desires.
.The league's real purpose can
hardly be expressed. It is an as
Miration for justice. It is aspira
tion for better living and a belter
chance to live. It is a demand
for an amendment of the rules
of the game of living so as to
give every man a fair show."
This is surely a high aspira
lion. The Nonpartisan league
has it in its power to make good.
It has won complete power in
this state in all three branches of
government, legislative, execu
tive and judicial.
If it will not abuse this power.
If it will really put into effect
the program of reform that it has
planned, it has the opportunity
to place North Dakota in the
front rank as the best governed
state in the nation.—Fargo For

AN INCREASING DEFICIT.
The deficit in the United States
Treasury was $78,000,000 on
November 4, the Saturday before
election, as compared with a de
ficit of half that amount on the
same date a year previous. Yet
there were some millions of peo
ple who voted confidence in the
administration that has been the
most extravagant in American
history
That all chicken thieves are not
black in color, although they are
at heart, is the belief of John
Brackin of Iiankinson. Recently
fifty of his flock of pullets and
young roosters were stolen dur
ing the night and the rig was
easily tracked to the outskirts of
Iiankinson.
Mrs. T. N. Roble has accepted
a position as teacher in the
Timm's district school in Slope
jf county. She is spending the
week-end at her home in Rocky
Butte and, 'will return to her
school next Monday.
Mrs. W. A. Orgain
Passed Away
One of The Pioneer Women of
Eastern Montana Died
At Dickinson Hospital
Last Saturday.
The many friends residing in
this vicinity as well as those in
Eastern Montana of Mrs. W. A.
Orgain of Wibaux \vill mourn
because of her death, which oc
cured at a hospital in Dickinson
on Saturday, Noeinber 4th. The
remains were taken to Wibauy
for burial.
The following eulogy by Frank
Cannon, secretary of the Twenty
Year Banquet Club of Wibaux,
expresses the high esteem in
which the deceased was held by
all who knew her:
"A cloud of sorrow is spread
over the entire community nad
more especially the members of
the Twenty Year Banquet Club,
by the loss of another member.
"Mrs. Cetious Orgain, who
passed away last Sunday morning
and who was buried in the Wi
baux cemetery on Monday, Nov.
Glh, came to Montana in 1 84
with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. S.
M. Wills and has lived here ever
since. The writer has known her
since 1886, and I can hardly re
alize that the reaper of death lias
come into our midst and cut
down a life so pure and in its
prime. Many are the times we
have seen her mount her horse
and sail forth floating in the
Iresh of early morn with eyes ex
ceeded in brightness only by the
"tars of heaven, and a smile on
her lips that made every soul
happy who looked upon her. She
loved |he hills and valleys of
Montana and all the people.
When she had arrived at the age
of womanhood, she was married
to our old friend and companion
W. A. Orgain, where she filled
the place of a good wife and a
ioving mother. "Mother", the
greatest word ever spelled by let
ters, is alone enough to make all
of us wipe a tear of sympathy
for that lonely husband and two
motherless boys"

OFFICIAL RETURNS SHOW
T. L. SMITH ELECTED
This week Wednesday the
Board of County Commissioners
met as a canvassing board and
with the assistance of County
Auditor McCarthy checked up
the returns of the general elec
tion held last week Tuesday.
Although various changes in
the returns were brought about
through their canvass the only
one of importance was the mis
take of five votes for county
judge found in the returns from
Divide precinct which decided
the race for county judge in fa-
vor of the present incumbent, T.
L. Smith. The unofficial returns
showed a lie between the two as
pirants, Frank J. Fitzgerald and
T. L. Smith but in the Divide re.
turns it was found that the clerk
had written Frank's name in the
wrong column, probably because
of the name being so long, and
that thus Mr. Fitzgerald had been
credited with five votes more
than he received.
It was an exceptionally closc
race, at that, and will long he
remembered in the county as one
in which both candidates were
fully aware of the fact that they
had competition.
KENISTON MADE GOOD AS
NORMAL PUBLICITY MAN.
Dickinson Press: George N.
Keniston, the man who put the
pep'' into the Dickinson normal
school campaign, has completed
his work, as far as the campaign
'or votes is concerned, and has
returned to his home at Beach.In
this, like in the Little Missouri
bridge matter, Keniston has made
good—remarkably so. Almost
without prparation he engineer
ed a publicity campaign such, as
has never been equalled in this
stale. In six short weeks lie
managed to lay before almost
every voter in North Dakota the
normal school issue at a cost that
did not exceed a two-cent stamp
for each one. And what is more
Hie publicity work was the most
effective ever pulled off in this
section of the country. Our next
big work is to get a sufficiently
large appropriation at next whit,
ers legislative session. Why not
let Keniston help?

If a lassie wants the ballot
To help to run the town
if a lassie gels the ballot,
Need a laddie froun?
Many a laddie has the ballot
,Not so bright as I
Many a laddie votes his ballot
Oercome with rye.
If a lassie works for wages,
Toiling all the day,
When her work the laddie's equal
Give her equal pay.
If a body pays the taxes.
Surely you'll agree
That a body earns the franchise
Whether he or she.
Refreshments were served at
the close of the afternoon.
Thanks is due the committee for
arranging so successful a meet
ing. This one is the first series
ol four similar meetings to be
held during the year. The re
