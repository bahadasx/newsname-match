With the advent of the metro

y thought Hughes was elected
The New York Herald, which
had unenthusiastically support
ed Hughes, said the issues were
upon principles arid not upon
men. Then it gave Mr. Hughe
along lecture oil bow the coun

four years.
The New York Sun, whicl

NeVV York, Nov. it-Oil tlie tnt 8 '

elected president of the United Stntes
with n nmjorlty of ut lenst eleven in

llcnns tire decllnlns to pay men- elec
tion liels.
The sltuulloii Is extruordlnury and
bus resulted In days of neive-racklntf
stxtiln for the people of the country.
If the election oillclala of u few remote
precincts in a few states know how the
nation lias been wultlhK breathless to
hear from thelu, they hlUst be swelled
up enormously with a sense of their
Importance. For on those few pre
cincts bus depended the nation's choice
of Its chief executive.
That Mr. Wilson's victory over Mr.
Uushes will not be conceded without a
recount In t lie close stutes, such its Cal
ifornia, New Hampshire, New Mexico
ami North Dakota, was determined at
conferences of the Republican leaders
here. Chairman Wlllcox nsserted u re
t'olint would he demanded wherever
ihe nini'Kln of Democratic victory wns
so small Unit comparatively few votes
would turn the scales. He nnd his as
sociates say they take the position
that there should bo no cloud upon Mr.
Wilson's title to the presidency. The
Democrats, for their part, declared
that there must be u recount iu New
Hampshire, even though the returns
krave the state to Mr. Wilson.
That the returns are still Incomplete
Is due to the presence oil tlie border of
Ihe National Cuard of a uui,uber. Of
states. The soldiers are .permitted to
vote by mail, Uieii- ballots belntf for
warded to ,t,le, auditors of their home
counties, nmj iu Minnesota especially
the vote of the Guardsmen la likely to
cut u llgiire in determining whether the
state goes Itittt the Wilson or Ihe
HiiKhes column.
Minnesota was as bad as California
In the matter of shifts, und ns Its dele
gation Is nearly as lurije, It, too, war
watched with the Intensest Interest,.
Through days and nights of counting,
the race was a see-saw, with but n
thousand of sd of votes separating the
nindldates. Nellller f?lde tvoOld ad
nilt defeat, and even now htitlt are
awaiting the soldier vote nnd the ofti'
dal count.
New Hampshire a Surprise.
rerhaps the most surprising of al
Ihe stutes wii" Vew Hampshire. It
alohe of all Ni Inghilid failed to give
the Kepuhlican ..ndidate tt substantia
plurality, and tor days no one knew
in which column It would land. The
astonishing closeness of the vote wsa
shown by the rival claims, three days
after tlie election, of 100 plurality for
Hughes and 84 for Wilson. In tlie clr
cumstiinces it Is no wonder that the
malingers of both parties should de
maud a recount.
New Mexico, with three electoral
votes, attracted national attention by
placing llsi lf curly In tlie list of doubt
ful Mates, and as it soon appeared thn
Almost every electoral ote would be
vital, the returns from down on ihe
border were grabbed hot off ihe wires.
After veering baeli and forth for days
New Mexico was definitely placed iu
the Wilson column, though there, too,
the president's margin was so scant
that a basis was afforded for the call
for a recount. A few mistakes dls
covered hi (lie figures of the precluct
olUciui m;lit well swing the state
over to Hughes.

Wlllcox Demands Recount.
Ou Friday National Cbalrniun Will
cos of the Kcpuhliciii , party hauded
out tlie following statement :
"The result still depends apoa the
vote in a few close states, it must be
home )n mind that the returns thus
flir litlliotfliced nre, in most states, un
oflk'lilf, mill may be changed by the
ofliclal count required by the laws of
those states.
Twice during these unofficial com
putations yesterday In California mis
takes in additions tvere announced
from that Mute, substantially cffflfltflna
figures previously given.
"It is n common experience that the
result of the official count almost ul
tvnys tarlos from thn returns first an
nounced1. "Where the vote fs tilt tlrme ns thai
reported Id several states, It hint tteM
be that material changes will result
from the ofliclal count.
"We o'w6 (i to the country to take
all necessafy tt to s'ee that an ex
act nnd honest count Of (je vo'te' IS
made. When the current seemed to he'
running ngalnst Mr. Wilson on Wednes
day tne Democratic managers an-
nouiicd their Intention to deinnnd a
recount In every close state.
"All we desire Is to make sure that
he vote Is counted ns cast."
Roth sides conceded that no mntter
what action might be taken tti fpgnid
to a recount there wns little likelihood
of n contest being carried to the house
f representatives as It was after the
ltii.Ves-Tllileti campaign In 1870. Legis-
ation enacted III J8.S7, It wns said.

nc Judgment In n recount of the pres-
Idenlfill vote.
How CoitSre.a Stand.
With returns missing froirl oitly one
ongressloniil district In the United
Ktntcs. the Republicans nnd Dcnio-
Tftfs ench had elected 213 representu
Ives. The vote In Ne'K- Mexico, which Is
still In doubt, probnbly wil'i telerinlne
which piirty Is to have n plurality of
one over the other. The present mem
ber from New Mexico Is a Republican.
The balance of power In the next
house will be held by foltr men, one
Progressive1 rrolet'tlofilst from
Louisiana, one an JndetM'fldeHt.. from
Massachusetts, one n Progressive from
iUiitlP'uitn and the other a Suclirllst
from New fork,
The action of these iiiWHWrn nn-
pnrently will determine the choice of
a fienkcr. as well ns the fate of legis

Six States Go Dry.
Prohibitionists are jubilant over the
results of Ihe election where promni-
loli wus nil Issue. From Washington
ho ltirlliitli'p committee of the Antl-
Snloon league issued a statement, say-
"Profllbltlon has taken another
great leap forward. Michigan l'S
voted for state-wide prohibition by
7.-),(XiO majority, Nebraska by 8r,(MKl,
Montnnn by 20,001) and South Dakota
v 2,-i.lKK). Idaho has udopted u pro
lilbltinn eon stltutloniil onieiKhuent by
n inni.irltv of S to 1. I'toh has proU
ubly elected n legislature pledgeti 10
nnct state-wide prohibition, wusn
Ington, lown, Colorado, Arizona find
Arkansas have defeated attempts oi
the liquor people to secure the adop
tion of proposals which would nullify
lualr iii'iililliiliirv laws.
"Thus "t states out of 4S one-half
of ihe states of the Union have now
declared for statewide prohibition,
id over 00 ner cent of the population
and 8.1 ner cent of Ihe area of the
country is now under prohibitory law."
Women Vote as Do Men.
From the ireneral result It Is clear
that as the men voted In the suffrage
states, no did the women.
In Illinois men nnd women seemed
Hlxmt piiiinllv divided as to prefer
ence. The stute went for Hughes by
s hi? plurality.
In Kansas. Colorado. Montana,
Washington, Oregon and California,
where women also vote, Wilson was
successful, but his pluralities were not
sufficiently lurge to indicate that the
wbhuin voters supported him as h unit
Farm Vote the Factor.
There are several great outstanding
r.ioiu r.,.,,n,M-i,(i," tiiiJ vKftfl of the elec
tion, one of which Is thfil biff, In all
the big Industrial states eV',.pi UUlv
declined to give Its undivided ttffor
to President Wilson despite bis cMJW
to It on the score of having persnadel
rrniress to pass the Adainot "eight
hour" lilll. New York, refrnsylfarrfav
Illinois. Massacfftfsvtts, Michigan. In
diana, all gave the l(i1fMWiv (until-,
date pluralities, and Ohio's tte In. ta
vor of vVIW.n Is not certainly to l ut
triliuted to the lubr vote.
Another Interesting development was
Ihe independence of the West, which I
asserting that It elected a presldeivf
without the aid of New York and 1'eiirr-
syitnnln and other big western ufJ
ceiitfil states. When It wns foundV
early in lff evening of election da.vr
that the empire Mute haT gone fr
Hughes, tlie newspapers of tf? Metrop
olis, evert those that had ippwel
Wilson, cniiceded the victory if the
Republicans, without fttlftg t hmr
from Ihe middle West. When the re
turns came In from these regions. It
was found that the farmer nnd etocic
raiser had decided the election.
Yet another fact that calls for eonv
ment Is that Governor Johnson of Cal
ifornia, running on .the Republican and
Progressive tickets, has been elected to
the United States senate by somethlnff
like 300,000 plurality, nnd yet the state
went Democratic on the presidency.
