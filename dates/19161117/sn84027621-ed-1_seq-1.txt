are dismissed as utterly false by the

In fact, it is said, the men on the

cautions taken by the Germans and
he skill with which their operations
were carried out. During the 20-

REMINISCENCE
xvi. ryy ; y y;'y.
Editor Star: In 'my last number I
told that during . the night following
the reconnoisance at Swift Creek un
der Col. Gautt, that Gen. Butler, for
some mysterious and unaccountable
reason, withdrew all of his forces
from Swift Creek and settled back
down at his base at Bermuda Hun
dreds. The Confederates finding the
way open at once took up the march
to Drewry's Bluff by way of the turn
pike, bivouacking for the' night about
half, way between Petersburg and
Richmond, in close proximity to But
ler's army; why he did not attack us
that night is another thing that I
have never been able to reason, out
under any of the rules of war. He
did not do' it , however, and the next
morning at daybreak our troops mov
ed, forward, and on reaching Drewry's
Bluff occupied the outer lines of for
tifications, which had already been
built for the defense of Fort Darling
and Richmond. -
Finding that our force was too
small to properly man the outer lines
of fortifications we moved back to the
inner and shorter lines. Gen. Butler
soon came up and occupied the outer
lines which we had abandoned, and at
once went to work to alter and
strengthen them so as to better fit
them for an investing force. You
know they were built to face the op
posite way "from that which Butler
wanted them and when he got there
they were, kinder "hind part before,"
so to' speak, and so they went to work
with great energy to change them.
Meantime the Confederates had been
re-inforced by a considerable number
of troops, from Richmond, and Gen
Beauregard having arrived to take
full command of all Confederate
forces in that department, he deter
mined to recover the outer lines which
the Federals were then., occupying.
Gen. Beauregard, on the 15th of May,
issued the following order to Maj.
Gen. Whiting, commanding our forces
at Petersburg, only twelve miles away
from Drewry's Bluff.
"General: I shall attack the enemy
in my front tomorrow at adylight by
the river road to cut him off from his
Bermuda base. You will take up your
position tonight on Swift Creek with
Wise's, Martin's and Dearing's bri
gades and two of Colquitt's regiments,
and about twenty pieces under Col.
Jones. At daylight you will march to
Walthall Junction, and when you hear
an engagement in your front, you will
advance boldly and rapidly by shortest
road, in direction of heaviest firing, to
attack enemy in rear or flank. You
will protect your flanks with Dearing's
cavalry, taking necessary precautions
to distinguish friends from foes. Thi3
revokes all former orders ., for move
ments. Respectfully your obedient
servant, "G. T. Beauregard,
"General Commanding."
Early on the morning of the 16th
our forces on the lines at Drewry's
Bluff opened the attack on the Fed
erals who were occupying the outer
lines of entrenchments as I have stat
ed above, and were driven headlong
from them, our forces recovering all
I of the fortifications occupied by .the
enemy and sent them flying .precip
itately back towards --. their base at
) Bermuda Hundreds. The fight was hot,

(Associated Press)
New London, Nov. 17. The Ger
man submarine Ueutschland whicn
sailed for Bremen early today, col
lided with the tug T. A. Scott Jr.,
twelve miles but. ' The tug sank, five
of her crew being drowned. The
Deutschland returned to her dock
here. Officials refused to say how
badly the Deutschland was damaged.
TUG GOT IN THE WAY
The Deutschland sailed unexpected
ly at 1:30 this morning. The tug was
convoying her out of the harbor Cap
tain Fred Hinsch of the German in
terned liner Heckar was the only per
son on board the tug saved.
Captain Koenig appeared pale and
shaken as he came ashore here. He
refused to discuss the accident.
A member of the submarine's . crew
said the tug got in front of the
Deutschland , and was struck in the
stern. The blow lifted the tug so far
out of the water that her. nose went
under. . A boiler in the engine room
then exploded, y
DEUTSCHLAND WAS NOT MUCH
TCwirDAMAGED ::" : ' -;
The. Deutschland was not seriously
damaged and will probably be ready
to sail within a few days, it was said.
Several of the bow plates were bent
and rivets loosened, but the interior
was ' notf damaged. .The crew , will
make the necessary repairs.
BOATS WERE CAUGHT IN AN

The submarine and tug were caught
in an "eddy," which twisted them out
of control, according to Captain Barry
Baker of the tug Cassie, which also
was convoying the Deutschland.
RUMOR WAS ERRONEOUS
Washington, Nov. 17 Official re
ports from the New Londoa collector
contained nothing to substantiate the
published report that a hostile motor
boat attempted to ram the Deutsch
land. Secretary Daniels has called
upon naval officers for a report.
sharp and severe, but resulted in the
complete rout of Butler's army. But
sad to relate, Whiting failed utterly
to carry out his part of the plan as
set out in the order I have quoted. His
troops were as eager to go forward
and crush or capture the demoralized
and badly beaten enemy that was
passing headlong right in hearing of
them, as any veteran patriots could be,
but for some unknown and unexplain-
aUe reason Whiting failed to give the
orders.
The plan of battle was faultless, and
had General Beauregard's orders been
carried out Gen. Butler and his army
would have inevitably' been captured
as was the intention of Gen. eBaure-
gard. The part of, the program he
took upon himself, which was by far
the most important, was a complete
success in every particular. Unfortunately-Butler's
beaten and demoral
ized army was permitted to reach its
base at Bermuda Hundreds thru the
failure of Whiting to execute the or
ders he had received, and thereby this
brilliant conception of a rare military
genius was thwarted, and the f ruit3
of a great victory lost. Gen. Grant
said a few days after this fight, that
Beauregard had Butler and his army
That about described the situation,
but if Whiting had carried out his
part of the plan of battle, instead of
being bottled up at Bermuda Hun
dreds, Butler and his army, or as much
as would have been left of it, would
have been "bottled up" in military
prisons But looking back at it all
through the back 'corridors of time
after fifty odd years, I find myself
asking this question, "Well, .what of
it? Would it have' made any difference
in the final result which" came about a
little less . than, a year afterwards ? "

CUT TO THE BONE "
Hughes Lead in Minnesota Reduced to
, 94 Votes
(Associated Press)
St Paul,' Nov. 17. Hughes' lead in
Minnesota was cut to 94 by additional
official returns today from eighteen
counties and Hennepin county com
plete. and we had the best of reasons for be
ing so.
Now, let us gather up some of the
incidents of the battle in so far a
they , touch our company, the Edisto
Rifles. In some respects it was a
proud day for us, and in others very
sad. It so happened that when the
line of battle .was formed for the at
tack just before day on the 16th of
May, the Edisto Rifles stretched right
across the turnpike, and just before
the order to move forward was given,
Gen. Hagood came up on the turnpike
to where our company was and asked
what troops we were, and being told,
"Edisto Rifles," he replied, "That is
good I could not ask for better."
Then turning to Captain Izlar he told
him that the enemy had a battery of
five pieces of artillery in the turnpike
at the line which they occupied and
that we were about to assault. The
general paused a moment and then
said, "Captain, I want you and the
Edisto Rifles to capture that battery."
The captain replied, "General, your
orders shall be obeyed." The captain
ordered the company to fix bayonets
and not fire until .we could make our
shots tell, and to shoot first to kill the
artillery horses, so that the enemy
could not get the. pieces away so
handily. Then the whole line . was on
the move to the assault and the fight
was soon hot, vigorous and deadly.
The five pieces of artillery and a
number of prisoners were captured.
Most of, the artillery horses were kill
ed. Of course the Edisto Rifles did
not, and do not claim the sole honor
of capturing this battery, for the com
panies on the right and' left did good
work in the business, but our company
being on the turnpike facing the
pieces had the hardest work to do.
Now let me tell you something. Those
guns were beautiful, brand new, and
all the equipments were new. The ar
tillerymen all had spick, span new un
iforms glittering with gilt buttons.
The company was commanded by Cap
tain Belcher, and when he was cap-,
tured his uniform was wet and muddy,
and he thought some explanation was
necessary and said that when he saw
his battery would be taken he laid
down in the ditch on the side of the
