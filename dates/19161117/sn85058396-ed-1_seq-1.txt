ports spread abroad recently by the

Deutstiiland Hit by a I
Tug Which Goes Down; i I
Submarine Returns I
New London, Conn., Nov. 17. Five
lives were lost when the German sub
marine Detschland, which left port
early today for Bremen, rammed and
sent to the bottom with its crew of
five the tug T. A. Scott, Jr., one of
its two convoying tugs. After the ac
cident the Deutschland returned to
port.
The collision occurred about a mile
inside the Race and, according to a
member of the Deutschland's crew,
came "all in a minute."
The tug, he said, got in front of
the Deutschland, the distance being so
slight between them that the submer
sible had no chance of avoiding the
accident. Her nose struck the tug
near the stern, lifting it well out of
the water and sending the Scott's
nose under. Almost immediately after
ward the boilers of the tug exploded
and tho vessel sank with all on boarC.
Captain Fred Hinsch, of tho intern
ed steamer Neckar, who was on the
tug, grasped a guy rope and was
urawn aown wun uie lug. wnen ne
rose to the surface he managed to
grasp a life preserver which had been
thrown out by the Deutschland and
was taken, on board the vessel, by
which he was brought back to New
London.
The Deutschland was not seriously
damaged, It was stated, and probably
would be ready to sail in a few days
when repairs had been made. Several
of the bow plates were bent and the
rivets loosened but the interior of the
submarine was not damaged. The re
pairs will be made by members of the
crew.
The Deutschland drew out of her
pocket at the pier of the Eastern
Forwarding company at 1:30 o'clock
this morning, accompanied by the
tuga-T;-A-- Scott, Jr., and theAIert
of the T. A. Scott Wrecking company,
sub-agents of the Eastern Forward
ing company. She carried on her
homeward dash a cargo valued at
$2,000,000 and consisting of nickel,
rubber and silver bars.
Was Moonlight.
Tho trip down the harbor was with
out incident and when last seen by
a newspaper launch, the submersible
was ploughing through a smooth sea
at the rate of twelve knots an Lour,
headed for Montauk point. The news
paper launch returned here after fol
lowing the submarine several miles.
At that time the sea was smooth and
the moon In its last quarter cast its
rays over the water.
Failure of the tugs to return at an
early hour led to much speculation,
but it was believed they would accom
pany the submersible beyond the
throe-mile limit.
The list "of dead includes:
Captain John Guerney, Engineer
William A. Caton, Fireman Edward
Stone, Cook Clarence B. Davison,
Deckhand Edward Uuezant.
Although the Deutschland apparent
ly had made ready for her dash for
some days,, her departure was rather
unexpected. Her commander, Paul
Koenig, spent the evening in his usual
manner about the city. He called at
two hotels and shook aands with
friends. When asked about his sail
ing tho captain merely smiled and
said he did not know.
Departure of Ship.
After leaving a theatre the captain
strolled down to the state pier, stop
ping to converse with persons on the
way. In the meantime thorough
preparations had been made for leav
(nr Tho mfiphliierv of the boat had
been tested days before nnd the craft
was provisioned. First the lights at
the pier were extinguished and the
launch Efo of the North German
Lloyd liner Wlllchad scurried down
the river to see that the course was
clear. Then the steel net that had
protected the entrance to the pocket
was hauled up.
At 1 o'clock the tugs Cassia and T.
A. Scott, Jr., of the T. A. Scott Wreck
ing company steamed up to the pier.
The pontoon, bearing a high fence
which stood between the Willehad and
tho dock was pulled to one side and
at 1:30 o'clock the Deutschland
slipped 'silently down the Thames.
Eddy Causes Accident.
An "eddy" caused the accident, ac
cording to Captain Harry Baker of the
tug Cassie, the other convoyor of the
submarine. The Cassie was travel
ing about half a milo astern of the
Deutschland while tho Scott and the
submarine were moving about abreast.
The sea was calm, Captain Baker said,
and conditions were normal. The
Scott carried the usual lights, but the
Deutschland had only her headlight
and two side lights
Tide Running High.
Tho tide was running almost lull and
when about seven miles weBt of Race
rock, thoy struck an "eddy" which
twisted them about and out of con
trol. Shortly afterward they came
together. Ho heard the crash. Tho
night was clear, he said, and there
were no boats other than the two
boats and tho submarine Deutschland
in the vicipity. Ho gave no credenco
to reports that a hostile motorboat
was approaching the submarine at the
time of the accident.
Henry G. Hilken of New York, prosi
dent of tho Eastern Forwarding com
pany, said that as far as ho know
the only damage the Deutschland suf
fered was a twisted stem. It waa
learned later, that the undersea boat
has in her bow at least one hole about
twenty inches square. A portable ;
forge was taken down to the pier and . !
the hole is being patched up. j
Captain W. A. Fones, shore super- !
intendent of the Scott company, in
charge of the repairs, said he 'expected j
that the Deutschland would be ready ! jH
to leave within two or three days.
Reports that a U-boat with a gun p j jH
mounted was waiting outside the three fl !
mile limit supposedly to convoy the j
Deutschland failed of confirmation n:
here. ,
