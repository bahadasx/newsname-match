British have again struck, and this
on July 1. when the offensive started, time they have made serious inroads
in the Herman lines." says the mili
tary expert of thn New York Times.
"When the British aro able to gain
good gun positions north of the Ancre
(and It may be that this last attack
lias brought them this advantage) the
German line, which stretches north
from Bi'aumont llamel will be doubled
up on short sections at a time. The
situation about Comhles will then be
duplicated. A continuation of this
process and the line will then be
straightened out from Arms south.
"The situation now is that with
every advance north of the river not
one, but two sections of the German
line will be affected. If the Uermans
south of the Ancre can be dislodged
by a flanking operation in the north,
then will come a situation very much
to the British liking. The salient of
which Beaucourt has been the apex is
almost a right angle. The sides of
tills angle are too far apart for the
guns on one side to reach the other.
Unless this can be done there is noth
ing necessarily weak In this form of
battle line. At present there is noth
ing weak in the German position and
will not be until the salient can be
sharpened into an acute angle. As
this angle is produced the length of
the German lines which can be reach
ed by the British artillery Increases,
so that with each blow a greater front
is affected. This Is the principal dan
ger to the Germans hi tills last attack."
