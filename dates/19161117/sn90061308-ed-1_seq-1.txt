KINGS PRAIRIE
We have had quite a bit of winter,
the wild geese are gocd weather
prophets. Gangs were seen a few
days ago going to a warmer clime.
Well, the campaign is over and ev
erything has settled down to normal
condition. You couldn't get a beker's
dozen out to hear a political speech.
All thosev who have been passing
over the new made roads, including
automobiles, have noticed the gooa
roadbed constructed by Frank Jack
son, the commissioner. For years the
plan was to draw rocks and other ob
stacles to the center and leave them
! to be bumped over, breaking half our
eggs. He had all these removed.
One of the most important issue3 , egraph lines were cut yesterday, they
before the people of Missouri was the j said..". The refugees also reported the
defeated prohibition amendment. But looting of a large German-owned fao
it is coming in the sweet by and bye tory in Santa Rosalia by the Villa
as sure as the sun rises and sets on j bandits when that town was captured
time. Every issue- is an educator. The
people are learning that a sober man
is more useful than a drunk man. All
now plants to make booze should be
built on wheels.
We understand Ernest Dummit has
returned. He didn't stay long.
There's no place like home. '

ers the absolute1 control of the politi
cal policy of the paper for two years
for the loan of $50)0.00. Have nor
heard- whether the liberal offer was
accepted or not.
