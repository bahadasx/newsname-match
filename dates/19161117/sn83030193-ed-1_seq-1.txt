FOR COLLISION
thn eastern forwarding Company,
owners of tho XJciltschlnnd, mado
brief denials of this atory, but bad
hardly uttered them when observers
on Plum Island reported to thle city
by telephone that a craft which
seemed to be u submarine wtth a
gun mnuntctl on deck, was lying off
.Midwa), Coiiii., near llartlett's reef,
not far from thn spot wlivro the Scott
was sunk.
MIX-UP CAME ON SIQNAL OF
DANGER AHEAD.
According to the story In circulation
the Hcott which was bucking the awitt
tide of The Itaco ahead ot the
neiltschland as a scout, signalled to
thn submarine Indicating danger
nliciid. Capt. Htnsch ot tho Interned
Herman steamship Nccknr, who has
been acting as port captain for tho
Kaatcrn Purwardlng Company had the
Sfott veer oer toward tho Deutsch
land so that ho could give orders by
megaphone. Tho tug was thus
brought so dangerously near the sub
mit! Ine that the tide swerved her Into
collision with tho under-Bea boat's
bow.
('apt, Hinsch, the only man saved
from the scott, was unconscious for
two bonis after he was dragged fiom
the water by tho Dcutschiaud'n ciow
and could not be questioned before
lie was taken to his homo here for
medical care.
It Is regarded as likely by shipping
men that he. was alarmed by the
craft sighted to-day from Plum lslv
an. I which may be a United States
submarine fiom Newport station or
possibly a Ilntish submarlno sent
down the cast from Halifax to In
tercept the Heiitschland.
MAYBE THE VESSEL SEEN NEAR
BY WAS GERMAN U BOAT.
Thero have been reports also of a,
Herman ntaal submarine supposed to
be lying nit the entrance of tho Sound
tu protect the lleiltsc hltutd.
Still anuther explanation of the col
lision was given by Capt. Harry Ilaker
of the C issle. He said that tho Scott
was abreast and slightly ahead of tho
submnrtuo when an eddy caught both
vessels In a whirlpool grasp and,
tunned them together.
Tho Scott was gunk about eleven
miles trom New London, whore the
sea tears past Hace Rock and tlit
water Is forty fathoms deep. Thsj
