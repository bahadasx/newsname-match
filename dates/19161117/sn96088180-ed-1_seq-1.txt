ended early today In a collision be
tween the auper-eubmeralble and an
escorting tug, In which Captain
Ouerney and four members of the
tug's crew were drowned.
The DeuUtAland, bound for Bre
men, put back for port Immediately
after the collision and by S a. m. was
'again warped into her pier. She was
once more shielded by the liner Wllle
bad, her "mother ship," and the big
steel nets swung In place to further
guard her. Work waa at once be
gun by a small army of workmen to
learn the extent of the submersible'
damagee a a result of her leeond
collision during the present trip. She
mashed Into a pier when she made
her start from Bremen and waa held
up 10 day for repairs.
The eolllalon thla morning occurred

points In that vicinity. The tug T,

Deutschland'i bow while the Scott
and the tug Caaale, acting a rear
guard for the aubmarlne; were steam

waa a apllttlng crash and a great hole

minute. The crew had no chance to
reach the lifeboat. Captain Ouerney.

Since the Deutachland came back
here under her own ateam, It la not
believed ahe sustained any serious
damage. Hurried examination led
Eastern Forwarding company offlclala
to believe she wonld be ready for aea
again la a few daya at moat.
As the big boat put out today,
rumors were revived again concern
ing a possible armed aubmarlne es
cort. The fact that the Deutschland'a
departure seemed to have been sud
denly decided on led some to believe
that the mooted aubmarlne cruiser'
had appeared off the coast and waa
waiting the merchantman.
Several thousand gallons of oil
were put aboard early laat night. It
had been brought la a hurry from !
Palmer, Mass., by apodal train.
. Eastern Forwarding company ofo -
ctals refused to treat serlonslv anore -
hemlon of a man, dressed aa a labor
er, who attempted to board the
Deutachland yesterday. The ' man
carried a small package of black
powder In bulk. Captain Koenlg In
sisted the msn be released, saying
he was probably only a crank
Later this morning a report was
circulated that a mysterious motor -
boat tried to ram the Deutschlahd,
and that In attempting to protect the
aubmarlne the tug swung directly In
the path of the undersea freighter.
Inquiry at the pier of the Eastern
Forwarding company,' where the
Deutachland again rests, brought no
confirmation of , this rumor. The
Deutachland wss running on the sur
face at the time., of the accident.
While there was no heavy aea, the
current, according to Caasle's crew,
waa unusually atrong. Because of
this and the inky darkness, , the
Deutschland'a lookout did not aee the
Scott Jr. quickly enough to sound an
alarm. All llghta that had not been
extinguished bad been shaded In or-
