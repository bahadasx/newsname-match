SAYS SUNDAY
Filled Tabernacle Hears Evange
list's Famous Sermon
PARENTS SEVERELY ARRAIGNED
Fathers and Mothers Blamed Because
Children Fail to - Lead Honest
and Useful Lives.
Boston, Nov. 16. "Billy" Sunday
was heard at his best tonight when he
spoke on "Home, sweet home," be
fore an audience that Oiled the great
new tabernacle to the doors. It is one
of the athletic baseball evangelist's
finest sermons, and he delivered ft in
masterly style. At times thousands la
the vast congregation shed tears, and
at other times he moved them to
smiles as he told of the importance
ot the home and how peace and hap
piness should surround it, together
with all that is moral and religious.
Pacing back and forth on his
rostrum and thundering out his
words as he gesticulated with great
rapidly, the evangelist severely ar
raigned parents whoi allow their chil
dren to be brought up In idleness
with unrestrained expenditure of
money and who are only remembered
when they go to an early grave for
the dissolute lives they lived.
Fully 10,000 people attended the aft
ernoon meeting when the exangelist
in his agressive style tore into the
churchgoers who are not sincere. Ac
cording to Mr. Sunday, the churches
cannot accomplish the work of God
until the leaders have the right idea
of their mission, and practice it fear
lessly. Mr. Sunday was greeted by the larg
est crowd that has yet turned out to
hear him when he reached the taber
nacle this evening. The great, build
ing was completely filled.
Reservations have been made- for
1500 Harvard Btudents and about 1000
Wellesley students for tomorrow eve
ning, which will be "students night."
In his sermon on the home tonight
Mr. Sunday said in part.
"I would like to throw myself tol
mgnt upon your prayrui sympamy,
that I may arrest the attention of
this audience and grip the hearts to
go with me to the most sacred spot
on this, globe the spot around which
cluster more sweet associations and
precious memories than any other
place in all the world the home.
"The longer I live and the more
I visit up and down this land and see
the Joys and sorrows, the successes
and failures of men and women, the
more thoroughly do I become im
pressed with the fact that the great
est institution of the American peo
ple today is the home, and every
home should be the center of all that
is elevating, Inspiring and ' uplifting,
and every home should be dead to any
thing that disgraces and pollutes.
"I think the proper or improper
settlement of the home question,
whether it is a house of joy or sor
row, weal or woe, is more with the
man or woman than any other prob
lem. "You can build your palaces, you

FUN5TON PICKS TROOPS
Reducing Border Guard is Puzzle to
Officers In Texas.
San Antonio, Tex., Nov. 16. The
infantry regiments ordered home
: uie lkjiuui luimy uy luo wai uc-
o?4 zlment were selected by General
VgvXmston from the troops on patrol
eiuiy at tne request or tne uepaninem
to designate that number of organiza
tions for release.
. Staff officers tonight professed ig
norance of the reason for the return
movement at this time. They were al
so at a loss to know whether the or
der is the beginning of a general re
turn movement of state troops engag
ed in border patrol work. It was ad
mitted in military circles that there
are state troops to take the place of
those relieved unless regiments that
have already seen border service are
sent back. All troops remaining in
state mobilization camps were ex
hausted under the last call when
25,000 guardsmen were sent to re
lieve some of the organizations that
had been on the border for several
months.
General Funston has asked the war
department to authorize the expendi
ture of $12,000 for floor tents and make
other improvements in the camp of
the expeditionary force in Mexico.
General Pershing's command has been
living in the field since last March
and is without many of the comforts
that are usually provided for a semi
permanent camp.
Aside from the question of need ,ac
tion on the request, officials believe,
w ill indicate the policy of the war de
partment regarding troops in Mexico.
If it is the Intention to keep them
there indefinitely the requested im
provements will be authorized, it was
said.
GRADUATE "DOWN AND OUT"
Dr. Harry Baldwin, Class of 1899, At
tempts to Kilt Himself.
Dr. Harry Baldwin, thirty years
old, who said he lived at the Cumber
land Hotel, Pittsburgh, was taken
from the waiting room of the Grand
Central Terminal in New York to Bel
levue Hospital Tuesday night, charged
with having tried to commit suicide.
According to the police he drained
the contents of a pint bottle of pare
goric. He will recover. Baldwin
said he was graduated from the Uni
versity of Vermont in 1899, and al
though prosperous for years, lately
had been "down and out."
can amass your fortunes, you can
spread Persian rugs on your floors,
you can sit beneath the Hash of the
candelabra, you can push a button
and have a retinue of servants doing
a marathon to see which will be hon
ored by waiting on you, you can loll
upon silken cushions, you can roll
down the street In the most magnlfl
cent and fautless equipages, but I
say to you, nothing can make happy
the father and mother of a godless,
drunkon loafer ot a boy, or a frivo
lous, coquettish, flirty, good-for-nothing
.empty-headed sort ot a girl that
gads the street with every Tom, Dick
and Harry, and makes you hang your
head in shame and disgrace that you
ever gave her birth. Not only peace
and happines . center about the home,
but that is moral and religious as
well.
"I believe the downfall of most men
and women can be traced to some de
fect In the home. Every blackleg gam
bler, every drunkard rolling and stag
gering and vomiting and spluttering
and spewing, every woman of the red
light district, was once pure as the
morning dew. No drunkard ever in
tended to he a drunkard.
"Broken homes and broken lives
seem to go hand in hand; they are
inseparably connected. Many times
sons and daughters are brought up in
idleness and unrestrained In the ex
penditure of their money, rapidly ac
quiring extravagant habits; they
figure In escapades that scandalize
society, in dulse in fast horses, gam
bling men and. women, and the diver
sions of the idle, racing, lust and
passions; and at last they go to a
premature grave, and are remembered
only for the dissolute lives they led.
"The women are silly, frivolous, ex
travagant; they have thrown to the
winds all modesty, prudence, religion,
and the virtues that are so attractive
in women, and have allowed them
selves to be fluttered, cajoled and bam
boozled by a lot of jilted Jays with
cracked characters aud they turn
their homes into a third rate gambling
den and booze Joint.
"The way to get rid of drungards
is to stop the reason. A drunkard
makes me sick. It makes mo sick to
see in a community like this dirty
hell-holes of corruption vomiting out
damnation. There goes a man sta
goring down the street drunk see the
cop got up and pinch him.
"Why not pinch the hell-hole that
made him a drunkard? So the normal
way f gft rid of criminals is to ctop
raising them. Stop raising prostitutes
Don't talk of the segregation of vice.
Get rid of what produces vice. You
spend a lot of time and hot nlr sit
ting around talking instead of going
to the fountain head and following the
thing through.
"In the home authority is needed
today more than at any time in the
history of this nation. I have met
upon the arena of the conflict every
form of mah and beast Imaginable to
meet, and I am convinced tonight
that neither law nor gospel can make
a nation without homo authority and
heme example. Those two things are
needed."

Recent Operations in Transylvania
( Appear to Favor Cause of Teu
tons and Their Allies.
London, Nov. iti. in tne mace-1
donlan theatre the entente troops i
continue to press the Teutonic allies
in the Cerna river region, and, accord
ing to the Serbian war olllce, have ser
iously broken their line both east and
west of the Cerna, southeast of Mon
astir, capturing four additional vil
lages east of the river aud on the
western side driving them back from
several points toward Monastlr. Ber
lin admits that in the Cerna region
the Bulgar-German forces have left
old and occupied newly prepared posi
tions. To the east the British have
taken the town of Karakaska, on the
east side ot Lake Tahlnos.
The Austro-German armies in the
Transylvania theatre, in the Alt and
JIul valleys, have forced a further re
tirement of the Rumanians and also
have made progress In the Rothen
thurm and Szurduk pass regions, tak
ing 1.200 men prisoner. On the west
Moldavia front Russian attacks cast
of the Putna valley were put down by
the Teutonic allies, as also was an
ofleusive in the vicinity of the Oituz
pass.
While Berlin asserts that there
have been only minor engagements in
Dobrudja, I'etrograd reports that the
Russians have made further progress
southward and that the Teutonic al
lies contlnuo to retreat, burning vil
lages behind them. Denial is made by
Berlin of the assertions that the Ru
manians have captured the town of
Ronasolo on the Danube.
Bombardments aro . taking nlaee
along the entire eastern front in RuB-f
sla and Galicia, according to the Pet-'
rograd war office. Berlin reports '
repulse of a Russian attack southeast
of Riga.
The situation east of Gorizla is
made obscure by the variant claims
of the Vienna and Rome war offices,
both of which record successes for
their respective armies. Vienna as
serts that the Austrlans have captured
another Italian trench in this district,
trlct. together with sixty prisoners
and two machine guns, while Rome
records the reoccupation of trenches
evacuated by the Italians Tuesday.
In the Ancre region of Prance,
where, since Monday, the British have
made notable gains over the Germans
the fighting apparently has lessened
greatly In violence, the latest British
official communication reporting only
bomburdments by the Germans of
their newly won front to the north of
the Btream. An additional six officers
and 297 men have been made prison
er by the British in this region In the
last twenty-four hours.
To the southeast, at Salllisel, where
the Germans had occupied a group of
houees northeast of the village, the
French have driven them out in a
counter-attack. according to the
French official communication. On the
rest of the front in France, especially
In the regions of Ablaincourt and be
tween Lesars and Gueddecourt, there
were violent bombardments of British
and French positions by the Germans.

G. 0. P. HAS MARGIN OF FIVE
Possible That Complete Canvass in
Three States May Reverse Situa
tion In Favor of Democrats
Washington. Nov. 17. No change
in the apparent political alignment of
the 65 the Congress has occurred thus
far as a result of uncompleted can
vasses of the votes In close districts.
Democratic leaders who had hoped to
gain one member in the 3d Louisiana
district were disappointed last night
when announcement was made of com
pltte Official returns showing that
Whit P. Martin, progressive, had
been elected over Wade Martin by 99

predicting that canvass of the returns
in P.uncombe county will show Repre

have been defeated by Zebulon Weav
er, democrat, the result still Is iu
doubt and court proceedings have
been instituted by the republican can
didate which will delay the canvass
until next week.
Hopes of the democrats for a gain
of one vote in Michigan and possibly
two In Pennsylvania have not been
abandoned. Representative lieakes of
the 2d Michigan district, who appar
ently was defeated on tho unofficial
returns, telegraphed yesterday that
an error had teen found in Jackson
county which if corrected would give
hlra the election by a majority , of 14
votes over Mark R. Bacon, republican
In the 30th Pennsylvania district yes
terday the canvass showed M. Clyde
Kelly, progressive, gaining on William
II. Coleman, republican, and the demo
crats still have tome hope of over
turning the result in the 21st Pen
nsylvania district where C H. Row
land, republican, now has a slight ma
jority over William E. Tobias, demo
crat. Last night the new House still
seemed .to stand. Republicans 217,
democrats 212. others 6. If the demo

JUNIOR DRAMATICS
Welfare Association Takes Up New
Activity.

Dramatic Club has recently been
formed and officers for the first
three months have been elected- This
club will be allied with the Education
al Dramatic association of America,
and will receive help and advice from
the New York headquarters.

ment, and as many boys as girls aro
hoped for. The officers are as fol
lows: President, Doris Harbour; vice
president, Agnes Jackson; boys'
monitor, Marshall Russell; girls'
monitor, Ceclle Jackson.
There are no dues at present, but
a system of fines for absence at re
hearsals, tardiness and disturbances
at meetings has been voted upon.
The next meeting of the club, and
the third reading of the play, "Master
Skylark," will be tomorrow, Saturday
morning at 10.30 o'clock at Library
hall. Every boy or girl between the
ages of 7 and 13 interested in drama
tics is eligible to the club, and is

Mayor Mitchel Refuses to Permit
Sunday Liquor Selling.
New York, Nov. 17. Additional
light was thrown yesterday by Mayor
Mitchel upon the moot question of
how far New Yorkers may go publicly
in celebrating the advent of the new
year. He made It clear that since

tension ot time can be granted for the

be dispensed If tho celebration is

suggested.

NEW WAY TO CUT LIVING COST
Peel Potatoes With Safety Razors, ac
Milwaukee Women Do.
Milwaukee, Wis., Nov. 1G. The fact
that far less vegetable waste is being;
received at the Milwaukee municipal
garbage crematory now than at any
time since the plant was opened was
attributed today in a statement by C.
O. Davis, superintendent of the crora
atory, to the high price of foodstuffs.
"The waste in the American kitchen
has been appalling and the present
situation shows what can be done
when economy is the first considera
tion," Mr. Davis said. "Judging from
thin potato peelings observed at the
crematory I suspect that the tubers
are being peeled with safety razors
these days.''
