WASHBURN COMES FRIDAY
Last Game of Season on Home
Grounds. A Good Game
Assured.
The Washburn Freshmen and
Wentworth will stage a football
contest on Friday, beginnig at 3
o'clock. This game will be the
last on the home grounds this
season, and, no doubt one of the
best. Wentworth is fast mould
ing into a pretty nifty machine.
While Capt. Racely has not had
the best of material to work
with, he has shown what consist
ent and intelligent effort may do
when the spirit is there. Went
worth has never lacked in spirit
and when the boys have been
properly instructed, they are
about as dangerous an aggrega
tion as could be imagined. Wash
burn will probably outweigh the
cadets and may defeat them,
but before the game is over,
they'll imagine that they have
somehow gotten into a hornet's
nest.
Death of Mrs. Clarice II. Bar
. nett.
Mrs. Clarice Barnett, widow
of the late Joseph R. Barnett,
died Sunday evening at 4
o'clock at her home, 401 Wash
ington Avenue, after a two
weeks' illness of pneumonia.
Mrs. Barnett was born in Laf
ayette county near the Prairie
church, October 7, 1847, and
was 69 years of age. She was

March 7, 1871. Mr. Barnett
died December 27, 1902.
Mrs. Barnett is survived by
one brother, M. N. Grant of
Laramie, Wyo.
The funeral was held from
the Presbyterian church Tues
day morning at 10 o'clock. Rev.
N. II. McCain of Lees Summit,
conducted the services.
Officers Raid Crap Game.
Sunday morning about 1
o'clock City Policeman Mavel and
Nightwatchman Seitz made a
raid on a crap game which was
in full blast at the home of Wal
ter Mason, colored, on North
Tenth street. There were fifteen
shooters arrested both white
and black, many others made
their escape by going through
windows taking the sashes with
them. The fifteen . arrested,
plead guilty and each fined $1
and cost.

and speaking of mending,
wouldn't it he a pood idea to mend your ways a bit and
quit putting off those repairs so urgently needed about the
place ?
how about it? think it over.
then pet busy.
, longer you put it off, worse shape things will pet into,
and the more it will cost you to "fix up."
of course you'll need some lumber you'll want the most

Barnett-Eygleston.
An event of unusual interest
to a very large number of friends
and relatives was the marriage
of Mr. Thomas Layton Barnett
and Miss Annie Wood Eggleston,
both of this city, which occurred
Wednesday afternoon at four
o'clock in the Presbyterian
church. The church was beau
tifully decorated with pink crys
anthemums, palms and ferns,
and the affair, while simple in
detail, showed the characteristic
good taste of the bride and those
assisting her.
Promptly at four o'clock Miss
Winifred Winn played the first
number of a short musieal pro
gram, which included a trio by
Mesdames Moorehead and Allen
and Miss Lucille Reagan, and a
solo by Miss Reagan ; the Lohen
grin Bridal Chorus was played
by Miss Winn as the bridal
party entered.
Mesdames Patterson, Rogers
and Sherman, Misses Bates,
Field and Gordon who assisted
as ushers preceded the bride and
groom, but took seats with the
guests. Miss Eggleston and Mr.
Barnett were met at the altar
by Dr. E. C. Gordon, of St. Louis,
who pronounced the marriage
ceremony.
The bride wore a gown of
white satin, a short veil and car
ried the conventional bouquet of
brides roses, but an interesting
and unconventional touch was
the trimming of the bride's gown
with a handsome lace bertha
which had decorated the wed
ding dress of her grandmother
sixty years ago. ""She also wore
her grandmother's pearls and
the gift of the groom, a beauti
fully designed platinum bar pin
set with diamonds and pearls.
Mr. and Mrs. Eggleston re
ceived a large number of their
friends at their home on South
street immediately after the
ceremony where sincerest good
wishes and congratulations were
tendered Mr. and Mrs. Barnett.
After the bride cut the wedding
cake a plate luncheon was seryed
and then the guests were given
opportunity to see the wedding
presents these were exception
ally handsome and numerous.
Mr. and Mrs. Barnett kept
their honeymoon trip a profound
secret. They, however, left at 7
o'clock in an auto destination
unknown.

INDIANS 13
Indians Come Strong in Second
Half But Fail to Win.
The game Saturday was any
body's game until the final
whistle blew. The cadets went
to work .with a will right at the
beginning and scored seven
points before the Indians' be
came aware that they were up
against a team just as strong
as they were. The first half
ended with the cadets 7 to the
good.
The second half told a differ
ent story. The Indians scored
two touchdowns, but failed to
kick one goal. The cadets in this
half negotiated a second touch
down and kicked goal. Final
score: Wentworth 14; Indians
13.
Mercy Hospital.
Kansas City, Mo.
November 11, 1916.
Dear Mr. Editor:
I think that everybody who
reads the Kansas City papers
knows something of Mercy Hos
pital and its efforts to make self
supporting citizens out of little
crippled people, and knows, too,
that Mercy is devoted only to
"Those who can not pay," and
that it has no line of creed or
location. But some of Mercy's
best friends do not understand
that the Hospital of the Little
People is not endowed that
last year it cared for nearly
three thousand sick and crippled
children and that it depends
for its support upon the volun
tary contributions of its friends.
This winter promises to be a
hard, one for Mercy hospital, for,
the "Two dollar a day man" can
not now meet the expenses of a
long sickness, and so Mercy's
wards will be crowded by those
who perhaps never before asked
for help. Potatoes and coal and
flour and eggs are very pressing
necessities, and we all know
what is happening to the prices
of all these things.
Mercy begs the Editor to give
room in his columns for this let
ter from its Corresponding Sec
retary, for, there are thousands
of people everywhere who would
help Mercy Hospital take care of
its family of sick and crippled
children if they only knew that
this call for help is very earnest
and very, very real.
Sincerely,
Mercy's .Secretary.
Hunter's Licenses in Demand.
Several days ago Game Ward
en Baker was scouting around
Odessa and arrested several par
ties who were hunting without
a license. Yesterday George
W, Bates, county clerk, received
from Odessa 32 applications for
hunters' licenses, 31 for county
license and one State license.
Mrs. Robert Wilson went to
Kansas City Sunday evening to
attend the funeral of her neph
ew, Lieut. Luther Welsh, United
States Navy. Lieut. Welsh was
killed last Wednesday at Indian
Head, Mil., by the premature ex
plosion of an aerial , bomb. He
with another officer were testing
a new bomb 1,000 feet in the air
above the Totomac river.
Mrs. Samuel P. Goodwin who
has been in Bethany hospital,
Kansas City, for about eight
weeks and undergone three op
erations, has returned home
much improved in health. The
friends of Mr. and Mrs. Good
win are hopeful that a complete
restoration of health will result
from her most recent operation.

Interest Increasing.
There was another fine au
dience at the revival service at
the Christian Church last night,
and Dr. Frank preached a very
interesting sermon on the sub
ject: "Two Fundamental Facts
About Sin." The two facts he
dwelt upon were those suggest
ed by the texts: "Be sure your
sin will find you out" and "lie
hath not dealt with us after our
sins, nor rewarded us according
to our iniquities." The singing
was excellent.. Members of
other churches are- very gra
ciously assisting in the work of
the chorus. The subject an
nounced for this evening is:
"The Forgiveness of Sin."

Which Do You Prefer?
It is important for reasons of health and
practical economy for every housekeeper
to ask herself this question:
" Do I prefer a pure baking powder like
Dr. Price's, made of cream of tartar derived
from grapes, or am I willing to use a baking
powder made of alum or phosphate, both
derived frcm mineral sources ? "
The names of the ingredients printed
on the label show whether the kind you
r.re now using or any brandy new or old,
that may be offered is a genuine cream
cf tartar powder, or merely a phosphate
or alum compound.
There is no alum nor phosphate in

HOTEL RATES ADVANCE.
Must Follow the Trend or
Go
Broke, Hotel Men Say.
Perhaps no business under the
sun is as quickly effected by
the high cost" of labor, produce
and other commodities as the
hotel business. Yet the hotel
men are among the last to raise
their prices to offset the ad
vance in materials used in their
business. At a recent meeting
in Moberly of the hotel men of
Missouri, it was agreed that the
prices must and would be ad
vanced on November 15th, from
$2.00 to $2.50 and $3.00 per day.
Representatives from all the
principal towns in Missouri, in
cluding our own genial hotel
proprietor, D. C. Morris, wore
present and concurred in the ad
vance. Next Monday and Tuesday the
Missouri-Kansas-Oklahoma Ho
telmen's Association meets in
Kansas City ' at the Hotel

Captain Alexander A. Lesueur,
who owns a ranch abc it three
miles west of Burbank, accom
panied by two of his daughters,
made the Review an appreciated
call on Monday. Captain Lesueur
formerly was one of the most in
fluential citizens of Missouri,
and served that commonwealth
for two terms as secretary of
state, discharging the duties of
the office in a highly creditable
manner. Trior to that time he
was editor of the Intelligencer,
at Lexington, Mo., and it was
generally conceded that he was
the most able editorial writer in
the state. Captain Lesueur, who
is a veteran of the civil war, is
now approaching the three-score
and ten mark, yet he is still act
ive in body , and his mind is
keen and alert. He is veuy much
interested in the presidential
tamPa" being very anxious to
i see the cuntry retain President
lison 111 lll? " hate House. The
Captain thinks Woodrow Wilson
is the equal of Washington, Jef
ferson and Lincoln. Burbank
