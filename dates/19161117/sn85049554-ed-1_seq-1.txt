Special to Times-iRepubllcan.
Red Oak, Nov. 17.—The story of a
Kansas City newspaper reporter nam-,
ed Daly going to Senator Jones and
offering to sell' him evidence acquired
by the Burns, detective Agency in their
investigation of the Villlsca ax murder
was told this morning to the jury
which is bearing the $60,000 damage
suit of Senator F. F. Jones, of Villisca,
against Detective J. N. Wilkerson.:.
Elmer Hyde said that Wllkerson told
the crowd the story at the iMontgom
ery farm meeting that Ddly had gone
to Senator Jones thru an arrangement
with himself and Sheriff Jackson, of
Montgomery county. According to the
story, Senator Jones refused to buy the
evidence and showed the reporter a
copy of a letter from George Cosson
declaring that the investigation of the
murder would be dropped. This letter,
according to the witness, Wllkerson
said the reporter re-produced for hlmi
Harry Minnick, of Des Moines, was
on the stand to tell of a conversation
he had with Wllkerson about- six weeks
ago, when the detective told him that
the reason the grand Jury failed to In-'
diet Bill Mansfield for, the murder was
because of three, men on witness stand
was because they did not accttse Sen
ator Jones, of committing the murder
but only of having it done. Jim Keyte,
of Red -Oak, Bert. Porter, John Smart
and- Joe Kenworthy. all ®f Grant,, were
put on the stand to tell o# a meeting at
which Wllkerson connected*-the• name
oi Senator Jones with'.the 'Moore mur
der. In examination ot.witnesses plain
tiff is placing emphasis upon speeches
made at Wllkerson's meetings by men
who were personal enemies of Senator
Jones and whose remarks were of a
character to show personal hatred of
Jones.
Wllkerson's wife came today to at
tend -the trial.. It ls thought, t^e
tiff faay rest' His case lite today.
Wllkerson Well to Do.
Two witnesses were called by- the"
prosecution and gave their testimony
They were Charles CallShaiy of Red
Oak, a, horse buyer, and-Jack Seefeldt,
of Ited Oak, proprietor of a granite
business. Both had- been present at
onei of 'Wllkerson's meetings held at
Grant, Iowa, over a garage there.
Seefeldt, said that at this meeting
Wllkerson said:
"Senator,Jones furnished the1 money
for the murder of Joe Moore. We got
the man who wielded the ax (meaning
Mansfield) and the grand juiy turned
him loose."
"I have been called a vagabond and
a tramp and Irresponsible," SeefeTdt
testified that Wllkerson said. At the
same time Wllkerson produced and ex
hibited a deed to 200 acres of land,
worth $10,000.'* "He said that the
3urns agency, for which he worked,
took in more money in a month than
tbe Villlsca tyank/ said Seefeldt.
Make wj of CrsAd Jury.
Seefeldt said that at tlve Grant
meeting, following a statement on
Wllkerson's part that anyone familiar
with the makeup of the grand Jury,
could easily understand why Mans
field was not indicted^ Clarence
Knenedy, a member of the grand Jury,1
present at the meeting, Interrupted
and spoke. Knenedy said that the oath'
of the grand jury prevented him fro:
verifying Wllkerson's charges. He
gave the impression, howeverf that the
charges were true, according to wit
ness Seefeldt.
Both Seefeldt and Callahan, who fol
lowed him on the witness stand, testi
fied that Wllkerson began his talk as
follows:
"I don't want to injure any one, but
I want to tfell you what evidence we
have uncovered. You men can do as
you please as to further Investigation."
Cross-examination of 'witnesses ap
pears to be for the purpose of showing
keen business rivalry between Jones
and the slain Joe Moore, once business
associates. It is also for the purpose
of making it Appear. Jones is popular in
the county.
NO NEW FEATURES.

Made by Wilksrson.
Special to Times-Republican.
Red Oak Nov. 17.—-Not many new
features were disclosed hy evidence of-*
fered yesterday in the WO^OOj damage

Villisca against J. N. WIlkerson, the
Burns detective, tor alleged connec
tion of ills name with the Villisca aJt
murders of 1912, *o\y being heard in
district court here before Judge Rock
afellow. In all,' nine witnesses -were put
on thfe stand yesterday by the plain
tiff, some of them to corroborate testi
mony Introduced at Wednesday's hear
Ing of meetings held jn Montgomery
and Page counties for the purpose, as
claimed by Wllkerson, of placing ^be
fore the people of Montgomery county
the cjiain of evidence, which he had
linked together in his investigation of
the Villisca tragedy and finding out
whether they wanted the search for the
perpetrator- of the crime continued,
A. W. Hill, who is a. farmer living
near Villisca,. said he went to the meet
ing at -the Montgomery 'farm* which

several automobiles. Hill testified that
Wllkerson on this occasion said
he had evidence that F. F.
Jones had furnished the miney to
pay for the murder of Joe Moore." The
composition of the grand Jury which
failed to Indict William Mansfield for
the V.illlsca murder waH tjlso attacked
Hill said. According to the witness
Wllkerson claimed that the reason the
grand Jury rctwwd to return an in
dictment was be|$)ise there-were warm
personal friend*, of Senator Jones on
that body. Referring to the county at
torney, whom the detective is said to
have charged with neflect of his duty.
Hill said WllkeAmn spoke of him as
"so lnsigniflcantvhe didn't know what
to call him."
Jones' Picture "Identified."
On cross examination Hill admitted
that Wllkerson told the crowd at the
Montgomery meeting that Vina Tomp
kins had Identified for him a picture of
Senator Jones and said that he was the
man who wore the "whiskers" in the
alleged "murder plot" which she Is
said to have revealed to the detective
sho overhead on the banks of the Nod
away. Hill also said that Rev. W. J.
Ewlng had opened the meeting on the
Montgomery farm with a prayer, pref
acing it with the statement that he had
been praying to the Almighty to throw
light on the perpetrator of the murder
of Joe .Moore.
l^ester Scott, who followed Hill Irl the
witness chair, repeated much that had
already been told by former witnesses
regarding the meeting in the Pryor
pasture south of Villisca. Sctftt de
clared that at this meting Wllkerson
said "F. F. Jones furnished the money
to pay for the murder of Joe Moore."'
'©Idn't he preface his remarks with
the statement that fye had the evidence
to show tnat Jones furnished
the money to jtay for the murder of
Joe Moore?" Wilkerson's attorney
asked Scott on aross-examlnatlon.
"He came out clearly and said that
F. F. Jones furnished the money to
pay for the muhler of Joe Moore," the
witness responded.'
J. W. Noel, ai, Villisca'photographer,
who t^aid Wilksrson sought to pur
chase pictures .fr0m him of Albert
Jones and wife, said that the detec
tiVe in a conversation had told him
that he believed ne had evidence to
connect Jones with the murder. On
motion of Wilkerson's counsel the tes
timony regarding- the pictures was
stricken from the" records.
More corroborative evidence of the
meeting in Prior's pasture was given
by C. M. Orr, a-Villisica produce man,
who was called upon to give his ver
sion of that gathering.
Seefeldt Good Witness.
Jack Seefeldt, a Red Oak granite
dealer and one of the crowd at th«
Grant meeting, made one of the best
witnesses heard yesterday. His an
swers were respphsive and to the point.
Seefeldt said that at Grant. Wilker
fon had declared that they had pro
duced the man£who wielded the axe to
this county, arid, they had turned him
looie.
"Did you understand from that lan
gauge t&fct he meant to charge ^Senator
Jones .wltiffifkaving hired tht.vperson or
persons- to murder Joe Moore?" asked
Attorney Beeson.
"I did,". rpjfMJS'd Seefeldt.
Cfcor^e Winters, an earjier. witness
in tlie present trial, tftok part in the
Grant meeting,vSeefeldt told. Winters
apparently had taken exception bo
Wllkerson's reflections on the com
plexion of the grAnd Jury and replied
that "if you can find "any better men
than W. flX Finlayson, H. Dirrim and
W. Rusk, I wish you'd name them."
These men were on the grand jury.
Hints at tamiperih^r. with witnesses
who ^appeared .before the grand Jury
also were made by "Wllkerson, accord
inf to Seefeldt's testimony.
O. R. Osborn, who attended both
:he meeting on the Montgomery farm
and the one at Grant, said that at the
Grant meeting when it was asked of
the crowd if the investigation of the
Moore murder should be continued by
Wllkerson there was not a dissenting
vote.
Enters Politics.
Elmer Hyde, a farmer northwest of
V'llisca, was on the stand lato in the
afternoon when adjournment was
yken. Mr. Hyde had also attended
both the Grant and Montgomery farm
meetings and is being questioned at
length. From Hyde, Jones' oounsel
brought out the circulation of'post
cards alleged to have been mailed at
Kansas City attacking Jones by In
nuendo at the time he was making a
campaign for re-election to the state
senate. These cards are declared to
ave borne this staterfient: "The man
who paid the money for this dirty deed
is now asking for your support In the
senate."
Interest Increasing.
As the trial progresses, interest In its
proceedings among people in this
vicinity is increasing and today the
largest crowd yet packed itself into
the courtroom. There were many

New London, Conn., Nov. 17.—Five
lives were lost when the German sub
marine Deutschland, which left port
early today for Bremen, rammed and
sent to the bottom with its crew of five
the tug T. A. Scott, Jr., one of its two
convoying tugs. After the accident
the Deutschland returned to port. The
dead:
Capt. John Gurney.
William A. C&ton,. engiiiei'i.
.Edward Stone, fireman.
Clarence
B.
Davison, cook.
Eugene Duzunt, deck hand.
Tug U*ts in Way.
The coiiis'ioii occurred aouut a nilio
inside the race and, according to a
member of the Dvuiscniand's crew,
came "all in a minute."
The tug," he said, "got in front of
the Deuibcmand, the distunce being so
slight between them thai the suoiner
iilbie had no chance of avoiaing the ac
cident. Her nose struck the tug near
the stern, lifting it well out of the. wa
ter and senaing the "Scott's nose uncier.
Aimost immediately afterward the
boilers of the tug exploded and the ves
sel sank with all on board."
Capt. Fred Hlnsch, of the interned
German steamer Neckar, who was on
the tug, grasped a guy rope and wan
drawn down with tne tug. When he
rose to the surface he managed to
grasp a life preserver which had beea
thrown out by the Deutsohland and
was taken aboard the vessel.
Deutschiard Not Dsmavsd.
The Deutschland was not damaged,
it. w'aa-'&wtflted, and probably will be
ready to sail in few days. Several of
^e br» piate^-»foi^ 51Ml^- '«^.hs^ th^D^taWWa*d^--sJls4!^al
rivets loosened.' The r«pairi» will be
made by members of the crew.
The Deutschland drew out' of her
pocket at the pier of tnfe Eastern For
warding Company at 1.-30 this morn
ing, accompanied by the tugs T. A.
Scott, Jr., and the Cassie, of the T. A.
Scott Wrecking Company, sub-agents
of the Easterrt Forwarding Co.nijahy.
She carried a cargo valued at $2,000,
000, consisting of nickel rubber and
silver bars.
The trip down the harbor was with
out Incident and when last seen by a
newspaper launch the submersible was
plowing thru a smooth sea at the rate
of twelve miles an hour, headed for
Montauk Point. The newspaper launcn
returned here after following the sub
marine several miles. At that time the
sea was smooth and the moon, in Its
last quarter, cast Its rays over the
water.
Departure Unexpected.
Altho the Jeutschland had been
ready for her darts for several days he/
departure was rather unexpected. Cap
tain Koenig spent the evening in his
usual manner about the city. He called
at two hotels g,nd i»hook hands with
friends/ When asked about his sailing
the captain smiled and said de did not
know.
After leaving a theater the captain
iitrolled down to the pier. In the mean
time thorough preparations had been
made for leaving. The machinery of
the boat had been tested days before
tbe craft was provisioned.
First the lights at the pier were ex
tinguished, and the launch Efcoof. of
the North German Lloyd liner Wille
had, scurried 4own the river to see that
the coast was clear. Then the steal
net that protected the entrance to the
pocket waB hauled up.
At 1 o'clock the tugs Cassie and T. A.
Scott, Jr., steamed up to the pier. The
pontoon, bearing a high fence which
stood between the' Wlllehad and the
dock wan pulled away, and at 1:30 the
Deutschland slid silently away.
Vice President Paul G. Hllken, of the
Eastern Forwarding Company, said to
day that a statement would be Issued
by the company, probably tonight, as
aoon as it wms In possession of full in
formation. He added:
*'The drowning of the crew of the
tug T. A. Scott, Jr« Is a most regret
table occurrence and none feels it more
keenly than the officials of th'e for
warding company and the officers and
rtien of the Defitschlan-1' That 't was
unavoidable goes.without saying."
Accident Caused by "Eddy."
An "eddy" cftiwe'd the accident ac
cording to Capt. Harry "Baker, of the
tug Cassie ,the other convoyer of the
submarine. The Cassie was traveling
aboi^t a mlle asteim of the Deutsch
land, While the Scott and the sub
marine were moving about abreast.
The sea. was calrii. Captain Baker said,
and conditions- were normal. The
Srott carried the usual lights but the
submarine had only her headlight and
sidelights.
When about seven miles west of
frace Rock the vessels struck an
"eddy." which twisted them about and
cut of control.
Shortly afterward they cariie to

and there were ho boats other than
