RETAIN NATIONAL
4 GUARD ON BORDER
.
SOLDIERS WILL CONTINUE TO DO
DUTY ON MEXICAN BOUNDARY
LINE.
CREATING TRAINED RESERVE
Secretary Baker Answers Numerous
Inquiries. Declaring That the Militia
on thr Border is "Winning Bloodless
Victories Daily."
Washington.?The National Guard
will be retained on the Mexican border
until It can be withdrawn without
again endangering American lives and
property. Secretary Baker so declared
the administration's policy in answering
a score of letters from many
parts of the country explaining that
the state troops were being held in
service after the emergency for which
they were called out apparently had
passd.
In general the complainants alleged
financially on militiamen and hardships
on their families.
By its presence on the border, he j
wrote to one, the guard is "winning
bloodless victories daily." He declared
thnt Americans resident along the
international line were enjoying a
peace and security they could not
know without the protection of military
forces. He added the presence
of the militia on the Mexican border
has restored order and given a higher
degree of safety and security to the
lives of our people in that troubled
country than they have hail for a long
time.
Referring to the elaborate and extensive
training the militiamen are
receiving under supervision of regular
army officers, the secretary expressed
the opinion that it would fit
them to act in time of war or other
emergency as a supporting arm. or
second line for the regular army, furnishing
an asset to National preparedness
that could not have been obtained
otherwise.
"Clearly so soon as a restored state
of order on the border Justifies It, the
troops will be returned . to their
A- homes," he wrote. "In the meantime,
it Is 'not possible for the department
to say how soon such a situation will
arise, although the Mexican situation
Is one of Increasing hopefulness."
JAPAN BELIEVED TO BE AFTER
FOOTHOLD AT CANAL MOUTH.
Secretary Lansing Orders Investigation
of Reports of 60.000 Acre Land
Concession Being Sought.
Washington.?Investigation of reports
from Panama that a GO.OOft-acre
land concession at the Atlantic end of
the canal is being sought by a Spanlard
named Fernandez, presumably
for Japanese interests, was ordered
by Secretary Lansing. Mr*. Lansing
refused to discuss the report in detail
but the action was considered significant.

been common ever since the canal
was well under way. Several months
ago it was commonly believed in diplomatic
circles that private Japanese
shipping interests were seeking land
through Spanish intermediaries to establish
a base for storing coal at lower
rates than could he had from the
American Government monopoly base.
So far as known noth? lg definite came
of that plan.
The present roports are that Fernandez
is seeking or has already se
cured a 60,000-aere land concession
through the activity of Raymon Valdez,
whose recent election to the presidency
of Panama may possibly be
disputed by the United States because
of alleged frauds and coercion.

known to the White House in recent

"If a strike comes, the public

Washington.?Plans for a more vigorous
campaign to prevent further
spread of infantile paralysis were
made here nt a conference of health
authorities of most of the states with
officials of the Federal Public Health
Service.
Resolutions were ndopted by the
conference in which eminent plague
experts, scientists and bacteriologists
are participating outlined different
proposals for checking dissemination
of the disease.
Uniformity of regulations for travel
on railroad trains, steamships and
other carriers, was urged by Secretary
McAdfo of the Treasury Department
in opening the conference
and while several speakers held that
general quarantine again passengers
from the Eastern infected areas was
unnecessary, the conference probably
will recommend a system of uniform
inspection, issuance of health certificates
and co-operation between Fedreals
and State health and railroad
authorities toward safeguarding travel.
Medical representatives of a dozen
large trunk lines urged the conference
to assist in securing uniform
traffic rules.

Yards.?Allies Are Now Near the

London.?The French and British
striking with terrific force in three directions
on the Somrne front, have
stormed nearly three miles of Gertyan
trences, driving forward at points to ,
a depth of 300 to 500 yads.
The most Important gains were
made by the British and French
troops striking north from the point
where the Allied lines meet. Muure-,
pas and C.lery, two of tho most important
points held by the Germans in
this sector, have been flanked on both
| sides.
The road has also been reached be ;
I tween Maurei>as and Guillemont, the |
latter town being the immediate obj
Jective of the British. This advance,
if maintained, brings the Allies directly
in front of the large railroad town |
of Sombles.
South of the Somme, the French !
stormed German trenches over a
length of about three-quarters of a i
mile, driving forward in a southerly
direction from Belloy-on Santerre.
Pans rejHirts that u considerable number
of prisoners wore taken in these
operations.
For the first time in many (lays no
important action is rej>orted from the
Russian front and the same dearth of
news prevails in regard to the Italian
operations. The most important item
of news regarding the Italian advance
against Triest is contained in a news
dispatch from Milan, which says that
German troops are to be employed in
the defense of the big Austrian port.
If corroborated, this means that Italy
and Germany will at. last enter into an
active state of war.

SENATE PASSES ]
NEW SHIPPING BILL
WILSON ADMINISTRATION SUCCEEDS
AFTER HARD LEGISLATIVE
STRUGGLE.
SENATE VOTE WAS 38 TO 21
Several Important Amendments Are
Agreed to.?Bill Has Already Passed
House and Will Very Likely Find no
Opposition in House to Amendments.
Washington.?The government shipping
bill passed the Senate by a vote
of 38 to 21. ending one of the most
bitterly contested legislative struggles
of the Wilson administration. In
the last Congress the measure precipitated
a Democratic revolt and a filibuster
which forced postponement of :
many important bills, but revised so
as to minimize the government operation
feature, received unanimous Democratic
support and solid Republican
opposition. It already had passed the
House.
The shipping bill provides for ere
ation of a government shipping board
to acquire and operate ships for rehabilitation
of the American merchant
marine and appropriates $50,000,000
for the purpose to be raised by the sale
of Panama Canal l>onds.
Several important amendments
were agreed to just before the final
vote, among them one which would
reduce the salary of the shipping
board members from $10,000 to $7,500
a year. Other amendments passed include
one which would authorize the
president to seek adjustment of foreign
discrimination against American ship- 1
ping through diplomatic negotiations
and to take retaliatory action if such
negotiations fail. Another would
authorize the treasury to withhold
clearance from masters of vessels who
deliberately refuse to accept freight
from American citizens without satisfactory
reasons.

much hanl fighting during the last
few weeks, and the British gain was
in tho direction of Ginchy and Guillemont,
near the Southern end of their
section of the Somme front. The
Anglo-French attack London says,
took place alory? tlie whoic line from |
Pozieres to the Somme.
The gains reported by Paris and
London were in the center of the German
positions on the Somme front
and mark another step in the AngloFrench
advance toward Combles.
French troops gained more ground in
the village of Maurepas. after the
stopping of German counter-attacks
near the village. Calvary hill, southeast
of the village, was carried by assault
and the French positions on the
Maurepas-Clery road was also ex
tended.

bill was unexpectedly vetoed by

officers "at outs" with the army.
