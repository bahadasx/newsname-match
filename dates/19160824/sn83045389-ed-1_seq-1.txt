It became evident to-nizht that most
of the railroad executives have come
to believe that there can tie onlv one
way of preventing a strike, and thnt
i= bv areept?nc t|he elght-hour-day
plan. The chief effort in their own
conferences t -day was to find some
srhe:ne bv which in eight-hour day
may be put in operation on all tlte
roads at the least added expense.
Many suggestions along this line have
been made by the presidents, but no
one of them has proved feasible when
submitted to the acid test of operating
officials.
m <;f;r.sTio\* itTi:i>
as 1 MPit trric \i,
As the conferences continued to-day
it hccatne more evident that the prin
cipal dlflliHilty of the situation is to
work out a plan of action acceptable
to all the railroads. Many suggestions
have come from the sixt> or mote
presidents here, am! have hern laid
heforr the managers. In every instance
they havo heen rejected as impractical,
and the executives take i|(<> position
thai no plan which the managers do
not declare sound can he taken to the
White House as the basis for settle,
merit.
It is well understood that most of
the executives now are convinced that
the eight-hour day in some form must
be conceded, and that they cannot ex
pect President Wilson to recede from
t he position he has publicly taken.
Their efforts were directed to-day to
discovery of a solution 01" the compli
cated questions of operation under an
eight-hour day, and it was said to
?1 rtrlit on the authority of many of them
that no practical plan had heen de
veloped.
I luring the day the representatives of
the railroad brotherhoods gathered in
Washington at the invitation of Presi
dent Wilson showed further evidence
of discontent and a desire to get away.
At their session to-day many speakers
declared that Hie presidents were play
ing Tor delay, and that no good to the
men could come from such a policy.
Itrotherhood officials were plainly con
cerned over this development, and some
of the leaders felt there might be a
general exodus by Friday night If there
were no Indications by them that a
.settlement was in sight.

Discussing the British embargo and
the great loss to !>e expected by Vir
ginia. Kentucky. North Carolina and
South Carolina producers, T M. C.ir
rlngton, president of the Tobacco As
sociation of the Cnited States, said last
night that the association would tnakc ,
every effort to have the embargo lifted,
and that he was rendv to appoint a
comm.Utec to appenr before the proper
authorities ns soon an ho was advised
b\ Senator Martin that such a course
was advisable
Mr. Carrington received a telegram
from Senator Martin yesterday, inform
ing linn thai an embargo on shipments
of tobacco to Germany and Austria
through neutral countries will be laid
after August XI. and replied by letter
lo ask what ha'I best be done under
the circumstances The Tobacco Asso- '
ciaiion of th<- Cnited States comprises
membership in all the tobacco-growing
States.
"We tobacco people." said Mr. Car- j
rington. "do not understand the situa
tion. Tobacco doesn't take the place of;
food, and we can see no reason why an
embargo should be placed against i;
The Ktiropean countries generally carry
a stock sufficient for two years, but. in
view of she fact that the tobacco-rais
ing countries of Kuropo are probably
bending all their energies in raising
food supplies, it is proba 1x1 e that their
stock supply is limited The embargo
may mean that we ml! have to hold
our stock ,\ little longer, but in any
event it won't stop tobacco growing.
"Since the great war the commor ;
grades of tobacco have doubled In;
value, aitd the freight rates have lv?on I
increased fivefold. In Eastern North
Carolina the late average valuation per
pound was from S to 1ft cents. Now
it is running from IS to 20 cents a
pound. Since the war has. it seems,
interrupted tobacco growing in Ku
ropo. it lias stimulated the sale of our !
common grades Belgium, Northern'
France, parts of Germany. Turk#y and
the rest of Kuropo raise as much
tobacco as the Cnited States, but it j
seems probable thai half the Rurooeant
supply has been out off by other '
exigencies of war. and. of course, now
that we have our chance to sell, we will
suffer by the embargo. Virginia alone
produces l.'o.non.oon pounds of tobacco
yearly, the average price being $in oi
$12 a hundredweight."
Mr. Carrington sajd that ho would
take further action to proteci the In
dustry as soon as he hears from Sen
ator Martin.

\V A SHI X C! T O N. August ?The
Navy Department was taxing its ri>
sources to-night to till iii? the first hypo
thetical gap in tlir country's defense
which has developed in the naval war
same in progress off the Atlantic coast.
Theoretically, a mob of ununiformod
men to-day overpowered the naval
guard at the piers at Scw?-lls Point,
on I lam'pton Roads. destroyed great
slorns of coal and supplies colectod ,
ther'1 for possible use of the "blue"
defending fleet and htirncd tlie piers.
To add i?> the realism of the game.
Rear-Admiral Llenson, chief of opera
tions. formally communicated the sup
posed disaster at Sewells Point to
Paymaster-'Jeitera 1 McOownn, whose
duty it would he in war to cope with
the situation there The paymauter
fieneral immediately set his fortes to
work to locate new stores of coal and
supplies and to find means for sending
ihem to some point on the roads at the
earliest possible moment. The problem
requires that actual supplies be found
and the possibility of getting them for
ward promptly be figured out, in order
to test the machinery of the drpart
ment.

While naval forces ashore were deal
ing with this angle of the game. Pear
Admiral Helm still was sweeping the
seas with his scouts in a southeasterly
direction from Nari aganset t. the base
from which he yesterday morn
ing in an effort to repel Admiral Mayo*
"red" ilcet. Presumably, the "blue"
scouts were within SOO miles of the
enemy's last-knosvn position at day
light. but tio report that "red battle
craft had been sighted reached the de
partment tip to a iate hour.
Officers here say Admiral Mayo prob
ably has changed his course and is
endeavoring to slip around the end of
the 600-mile line of scouts with his
fifteen battleships and thirty transports.
If he can reach a point between Cape
Hattcras and Kastport. Me., without
having been sighted, he will be able
to employ his tleet to hold off the
"blue" squadrons while a landing is
eff ect ed.
The Sewells Point base was only one
of a number so scattered along the
coast that tin- defending fleet would
have quick access i<> any stores it ,
might need. Should the department
fall to repair damages before Admiral
Helm calls upon it for aid from that
particular base, his ships will have to'
go far out of their way to coal and take I
on ammunition and supplies.

country with nothing hut Held equip- |
ment." declared General .1. .1. Pershing,
commander of the punitive expedition, ;
when shown the department's figures. ,
"It probably is as low a record as any !
similar expedition ever has set, and ;
shows the wonderful strides made j
atonfc sanitary lines within the last few 1
years and the high efficiency of the j
sanitary department.
? "It also flums the high appreciation
of sanitary r<y: illation by line oflieers,
who have l.erri held to a striet necount

r.ONDON*. August 23.?On the western
front the French are apparently mark
ing time while the British push against
Thiepval and Guillemont. The War
Office reports a fresh tightening of the
ring around Thiepval tn the capture.'of
20ft yards of Herman trenches south of
tho town. Hitter fighting is going on
tn this section. The Germans succeeded
in entering some British trenrhes, but.
according to the British statement, were
Immediately evicted.
yThe fierce struggle around Fleury. In
the Verdun .sector, continues. Thn
| French claim "an appreciable advance"
between Fleury and Thiaumont and the
capture of 2"?0 prisoners.
Conflicting claims arc made by Berlin
and I'etrograd on the fighting on the
eastern front. Both report the capture
of positions near Jablonltr.a Pass, where
a violent struggle has been in progress
several days on the crest of the Car
pathians. Berlin also claims the san
guinary repulse of Russian attempts to
? ross the Stokhod, *n<1 apparently
desperate fighting is going on.
CI.AIMS ix iiegari> to recknt
FIGHTING IN NORTH SEA
Both sides continue to make claims
j and counterclaims in regard to the
recent fighting in the North Sea. Bcr
I tin admits that the battleship West
falen was struck by a torpedo from an
Knglish submarine, but maintains that
the damage was slight. The German
Admiralty reiterates that a British bat
tleship was heavily damaged by a Ger
man submarine. This is denied by the
British Admiralty.
With no important changes in th?
main war theaters, interest remains
centered on the new allied offensive on
the Saloniki front. The latest dis
patches, however, throw little light on
j the situation, and the allies' plans are
somewhat obscure.
The War Office reports that the Bul
garians have advanced along the Struma
Valley and have intrenched themselves
at various points. Berlin also reports
further advances for them on the right
wing, where they face the Serbians.
Apparently, howevor. no action of first
importance has yet developed.
Interest in the attitude of the Greeks
lias been heightened by dispatches tell
ing of the determination of the Greek
commander at Seres to resist the Bul
garians and of volunteers being organ
ized for his assistance by the Venizeloa
leaders at Saloniki. There has been no
further development In the Roumanian
situation. The last report from Berlin
maintains that Roumania hns not
reached a decision.

The statement eays:
?'South of Thiepval (in the Somme

of a German trench. which has
strengthened our line and improved our
position.
"The enemy's artillery, which had
been showing much activity, was si
lenced in three different area/t by the
counterbattery work of our heavy guns,
which appeared to be very effective.
"When the weather cleared yester
dn\ evening enemy aircraft, which had
displayed tin wonted enterprise, were
engaged in large numbers with most
satisfactory results. The fighting was
continuous until dusk. At least four
hostile machines were destroyed and
many others were driven down, dam
aged and apparently out of control.
Others were pursued to th??lr aero?
drome We suffered no casualties.
"Despite the continual fighting, s,
reconnolssatice was completed success
fully, and bombing raids were carried
out against sundry points of import
ance."
