Resent Statements Attribut

ranted Reflections.
New Tork, Aug. 24 The German
Roman Catholic Central Verein, in its
closing session here Wednesday night,
adopted a resolution sharply criticis
ing president Wilson for having "pre
ferred charges" in his message to
congress "against part of our citizen
ship who theretofore enjoyed the proud
distinction of unquestioned loyalty
and patriotism."
The resolution, presented by a com
mittee headed by Joseph Matt of St.
Taul. Minn, was as follows:
"Without precedent in the history of
our country vv e find the president of
the United States publicly in his
official message preferring charges
against a part of our citizenship who
theretofore enjoyed the proud distinc
tion of unquestioned loyalty and
patriotism.
"We regret this utterance and de
plore its effects, especially in view of
its general character without substan
tiating facts, as such utterances com
ing from such high sources are calcu
lated to foster unfounded suspicion
and mistrust of a large element of our
American people and imperil the con
summation of a program of social
efficiency In our country."
Alphonse G. Koelble, president of
the United German Societies of
America in a speceh urging the passage
of the resolution, declared:
"We have been accused of being
false to the flag, the flag for w hich "ve
bled and died Although I play as safe
ju: am- one. I am in favor of turning
against this infamous attack on our
