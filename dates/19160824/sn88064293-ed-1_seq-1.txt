applause in his ragtime diver
sion entit!ed"Pray for the Light
to Go Ou t". Mr. L. J. Adams
was appreciated in a late and
catchy song, "Don't Bite the
Hand That's Feeding You". Miss
Bessie Wise sang one of the
sweetest of Irish Melodies "Just
a Little Bit of Heaven, and They
Garden of My Heart". Miss Olli i
j Hebert added to her already
j heaped-up laurels as a soloist by
Called It Ireland". Miss Wise j
has an exceedingly musical voice i
and delighted her hearers with
her song. "The Hesitating Blues"
by Mr. Charles Delas, was one of
the best numbers on the program
and he was enthusiastically en
cored. Mr. V. W. Nunez sang a
beautiful ballad called "In the
her charming little French "Un
Peu d'Amour". Miss Hebert is
a singer of rare talent and per
sonal charm and is one of the
Morgan City's favorite daugh
ters. Mr. Eugene Delas captured
the crowd with his "You Missed
a Good Woman When You Piek
ed All Over Me." His song was I
one of the decided winners on the j
program. Immediately following j
the number by Mr. Eugene De-MT
las the entire circle sang down !
the curtain on the first part with
a musical medley that fittingly
ended an hour of continuous
umphs.

the program. A number omitt

program but put in the perform

number brought volleys of laugh

The
j cast included Mr. Robert Gillen
i in the decrepit character of Abi
of
a
jah Pippins, the defendant in the
exciting breach of promise suit
before the court*; Mr. Linus Ter
rebonne, judge of the court was
splendid in his judicial interpre
tation of the part ; Mr. Jack Cho
ron ister as the court officer was
a typical Irish cop and did his
best to preserve order with a
disorderly jury; Mr. Frank
{Vaughn as Snapcash, attorney
is
jfor the plaintiff, surprised his
friends with his knowledge of
the case in hand and his insidu
ous attempt to pry the defend
ant loose from $5000 as balm for
the wounded heart of his client ;
Mr. P. H. Kinney, lawyer for the
I maligned unfortunate. Abijah
j Pippins, sprung numerous legal
j phrases and outbursts ot orato-,
De-MT * n behalt ot his client—it was
! probably due to his masterly ap
ipeal to the jury that the divid
couple were once more
tri-jbrought into harmony; Miss
Irma Ditch as Mrs. Lenora

Miss Grevenberg contributed to
! the fun of the sketch bv her |* s
jlaughable impersonation of Aun-imunity
jty Simpson and appeared to bejyour
■equally talented in character
!work as in music. As a musi- J
!cian. Miss Grevenberg is posses- !
[sed of remarkable talent and she
effectively, and it was probably
strange to the spectators that
her charms, which so obviously
affected the jury, did not win
for her the balm she asked. On
[second thought, however, the
audience will recall that the
(jury was completely dominated
i by a vigorous suffragette who
[announced her intention of run
jning things and who carried
|out her intentions. This part
j of Mrs. Doctor Pullem was ably
! acted by Miss Edna Gillen. Miss
; Ruth Moncrief as Miss Amelia
j Bedelia Arrowroot was the beau
jtiful corroborative witness for
(plaintiff. Her full and complete
answers of "yes" anti "no" to
j the intricate legal conundrums
! propounded by the cross-exam
liner showed that she was really
I familiar with the details lead
ing up to the suit. The jury
! was composed of a cosmopolitan
I group who represented many
j nations and many freaks. In
I addition to the forelady already
! named the jury included: Mr.
jCass Jolley as Levi Hochheimer,
j Mr. J. C. Harrell as One Lung
; Gong, Mr. Eigene Delas as Van
derbilt Persimmons, Mr. Raoul
Delas.as Jamison James. Mr. J.
L. Adams as Goblieb Wurst

Measles. Mr. W. J. Bouterie as
Holligan. Mr. Charles Delas as
(has generously put her ability
jat the service of many of the
; benefits held in the city in the
past few years.
Tonight the minstrels go t «>

ence won from their perform
ance of last night, a great suc
cess is predicted.
