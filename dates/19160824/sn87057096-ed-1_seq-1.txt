Chautauqua Closed Friday niklit.
The Leon Chautauqua closed Fri
day night with everybody pretty well
satisfied with all the attractions for
the eight days. Of course every pro
gram did not exactly suit everybody,
but taking it all the way through it
was a splendid program, the best we
have ever had in Leon, and a suffici
ent guarantee was made to secure the
return of the Midland Chauauqua to
Leon next year.
On Wednesday the speaker was ex
Senator Elmer J. Burkett, of Neb
raska, who spoke on "The Protest of
Americanism Against the Govern
ment Ownership of Railroads," and
this lecture was the poorest on the
entire program, the speaker getting in
oad with his audience when he roast
ed any one who had to leave during
Ins address. The music was by the
Sibyl Sammis-McDermid Company,
consisting of Mrs. McDermid, a fine
singer, assisted by Abe Sopkin, a
young Russian violinist, and Seneca
Pierce, pianist. It was high class, the
only objection being that much of it
was a little too classical to be appreci
ated by the majority of the audience.
They gave the entire program in the
evening.
Thursday afternoon Ned Wood
man, humorist and cartoonist ably
entertained the big audience, and he
was fine. The-Katchel Metropolitan
Singers did not arrivel until late but
gave-several fine elections. This com
pany provided the concert on Thurs
day evening and many pronounced it
gram, and a full concert in the even
ing. This band is an exceptionally
large and fine one, and their music
pleased everybody.

having hard the varied splendid en
tertainment, and instructive lectures.
ed on the Leon Chautauqua program,
with whom many found a great deal
of fault, and he is a man who should
not be permitted to appear on any
Chatauqua platform. We refer to
ex-Senator Burkett, who spoke last
Wednesday afternoon. Burkett was
elected to congress by an accident,
but one term was enough, and his
constituents retired him by a big
vote at the end of his first term. He
is one of those bigotted fools, who
imagines that he is a big "it," and
that very few of his hearers have any
brains. At various times in his lec
ture he stopped to roast people who
had to leave or did not care to hear
him. This is something which no
speaker haias a right to do, bawl out
any person who sees fit to leave.
They had paid for the privilege of go
ing, and have a perfect right to leave
the tent at any time, and without sub
jecting themselves to ridicule by the
speaker, who takes advantage of his
position on the platform. He does
not know why people have to leave.
They may have to catch a train, have
another engagement, or other similar
good reasons for leaving, or if they
do not like the speaker, they are not
lacking every element of a gentle-
man, and is a low down cad. He
knows they have no chance to make
any explanation, and in Burkett's
case we Rnow of a number who want

Some Postal Rulings.
We recently had inquiries from,
patrons of the Leon post office in re
gard to whether any person is re
quired to rent a box in order to re
ceive their mail, and also as to
whether a patron residing on a rural
route had the right to call at the
postoffice and receive any mail which
was in the office for them which had
arrived after the carrier had left on
his trip over the route. We did not
want to decide the matter without
authority, so we sent inquiries to the
Postmaster General's office at Wash
ington asking for a ruling in eacli
case. The replies say that no post
master has the right to require any
one to rent a box, and that any per
son residing on a rural route, calling
lor their mail shall have it delivered
to them by-the postmaster.
"In regard to, being required to
rent a box the Postmaster General's
reply is as follows:
"I beg to inform you that under
the postal Laws and Regulations, no
postmaster is permitted to require
iiny patron of his post office or other
pei son to rent a delivery box, for the
reason that all have the right to re
ceive their mail at the general deliv
ery window free of expense."
In regard to delivering mail to rur
al patrons the Postmaster General
writes, saying: "I enclose a copy of
sections 773-774, Postal Laws and
Regulations, which prescribe the con
ditions under which rural route pat
rons may receive their mail at the
post office. This Bureau will give
careful consideration to any specific-,
complaint you may desire to submit."
The following are the sections re
ferred to:
Sec. 773. Postmasters shall de
liver mail of all classes to patrons of
rural-delivery routes who call there
for at the post offices when they are
open for business on Sundays and
holidays, and also at other times
when such delivery will not interfere
with the business of the office or de
lay the rural carriers in departing for
service of their routes.
Sec. 774. Postmasters may, if con
ditions justify, require rural carriers
to report for duty for one hour on
holidays on which service is not ren
dered on rural routes to assist in de
livering mail to patrons of rural
routes who call for it. Postmasters
shall not call upon rural carriers to
perform duty on Sunday except when
their services are urgently necessary
for the purpose above set forth.

tions of 1913.
Auto Turned Turtle. X*?
While F. A. Garber .and family, of
Center township, were on their way to
Davis City last Thursday to attend
the reunion, they met with ah acci
dent a short distance ea~dt of Davis
City, when their auto turned turtle,
but fortunately no one was injured
&Bide from a few slight scratches, and.
no damage was done to the car ex
cept to crack three spokes in a rear
wheel. Mr. Garber was following
another car, which sloVed up on ac
count of a narrow culvert, and as
he
was pretty close to it, he turned
the
car quickly to avoid running into It^
when like a flash it turned turtle.
The top was not up, and how
they
all escaped Injury is a miracle. Frank
is a pretty husky fellow^and he
turn
ed the car right side up and was on
his way again before the next car
came along.
