STRIKE SITUATION AT
A CRITICAL STAGE
RAIL MANAGERS WITHOLD AN
SWER—MEN BECOMING UN
EASY—SOME ACTION SOON
Washington, Aug. 23.—The rail
road employes, committee showed
such marked signs of unrest today
at the delay in the negotiations be
tween President Wilson and the rail
way executives, that the leadsrs of
the men became alarmed and_ openly
expressed fears of their ability to
hold the men much longer. The em
ployes' meeting was thrown into an
uproar by speeches of the minority
demanding immediate action unless
the roads accept Wilson's plan, but
the leaders succeeded in adjourning
the meetftig before any vote was
taken on the various proposals. Some
of the men urged that most of them
go home, leaving the brotherhood
heads with authority to call the strike
if the railroads do not accept Wilson's
plan.
The meeting adjourned until to
morrow morning. Frequently shouts
and applause were heard a block from
the hall.
"It is our belief," said one com
mitteeman, 'that the railroads an
plaving for time with Wilson just
as they have done with us for months.
There is no reason why they should
not give Wilson an answer immedi
ately.
"Discontent among the men is
spreading rapidly."
Washington, Aug. 23.—President
Wilson summoned Senator Newlands
and Representative Adamson, chair
men of the senate and house com
merce commissions, to the Whire
House today. It is understood that
he planhed to discuss with them legis
lation on the railroad strike situation.
The president plans for a settlement
of the dispute, which would create a
commission to inves igate the work
ing of an eight-hour day and collateral
issues.
Men Are Impatient
Meantime, the men, tired of the de
lay due to the railroad representa
tives' prolonged discussion of Wil
son's plan, .gave free expression to
their opinions of today's meeting.
The men felt the railroads show a
disposition to disregard their sacrifice
of the demand for time and a half
overtime.
A. B. Garretson advised patience,
predicting action soon.
"The situation is in the hands of
President Wilson and until he acts
there is nothing for us to do," said
Garretson.
Other leaders said plans were made
for instant action in case the railroad
managers decline Wilson's proposal.
Ready to Act
Newlands and Adamson, after the
conference with Wilson '"hit
they approved the president's pro
posal and that they were ready to
push any needed legislation.
Further, they would not discuss
the conference. It is understood,
however, that the creation of a per
manent commission to investigate fu
ture controversies was one of the
subjects discussed.
The bill adding two members to the
Interstate Commerce commission,
which already passed the house and
comes before the senate Friday, also
was discussed at the conference. It
is understood definitely today that the
railroad executives decided to act as
a unit in handling the present situa
tion.
The program of the railroad execu
tives today was to deal first with the
principle of arbitration and afterward
with the eight-hour day.
If means can be found for guaran
teeing aibitration in future disputes,
at least some of the railroad execu
tives favor acquiescense with the
eight-hour demand.
It was declared in administration
circles today that both Wilson and the
railroad executives seemed on a way
to an aigreement.
President Wilson expects another
call from the committee of railroad
executives some time before tomor
row.
Men Are Restless
Restlessness on the part of the men,
who openly declare the railroads are
"playing Wilson for more time,'* be
came more and more impatient late
today. One leader said, "We can
probably hold the men here another
day or two."

Youth Meets Death
While Swimming
An attempt to rescue his younger
brother, John, from danger of drown
ing cost Donald age 11, the oldest son
of Mr. and Mrs. C. F. Currie, 703
Fifth ave. west, his life.
The Currie boys, accompanied by
some companions of about the same
age, went to Sand Creek just west of
the city last Thursday afternoon to
swim. It had been the intention to
stay in the shallow waters farther up
the creek but the wider and deeper
channels in the old bed of the Mis
souri attracted the boys.
John Currie, 10 years old, not yet
a strong swimmer, was wearing "wa
ter wings" and while in mid-channel
had trouble In keeping afloat and call
ed for help. Donald, who was a good
swimmer, ordinarily, went at once to
his brother's assistance but appeared
to receive a great fright at John's
danger and lose control of his powers.
As soon as the boys clasped each
other they began to sink and those on
the bank called to John to let go of
Donald. This he did and was able rp
reach the bank. Donald, apparently
unable to help himself, sank and never
arose. It is believed that the shock
from fright affected his heart.
Those on shore could only run to a
telephone, over half a mile away, and
summon help. Dr. Jones, Norman
Dickey and others reached the scene
in the shortest possible time and the
body was recovered after being in the
water more than an hour. Every ef
fort was made at resuscitation.
Donald was a boy of exceptionally
fine character and dutiful habits. He
always ranked high in his classes and
was the pride of his devoted parents.
The services over the remains were
conducted by Rev. J. H. Batten in the
Congregational church Saturday fore
noon at 10:30. A very large attend
ance of friends and abundant floral
offerings were a tribute to their high
esteem of the departed boy and deep
sympathy for the stricken parents.
Forty Acres Wheat
Bring Farmer $2,000
Proof is not lacking that there are
some fields of excellent wheat in
Williams county. A few days ago J.
J. Larson, whose farm is on the
Squires road, about 14 miles west
of Williston, exhibited o. sample of
marquis wheat that is of exceptional
quality for this season. He had
threshed out enough by hand for a
test sample which showed 57 pounds
to the bushel. .The wheat is of a good
color and only a small per cent of it
is shrunken. Mr. Larson has made
a very careful estimate and believes
that the 40 acre field will yield 28
bushels per acre. He has already re
ceived an offer of $2. per bushel for
the whole crop, the buyer desiring to
hold it for seed.
Reducing the estimate to 25 bush
els to the acre, Mr. Larson's gross
receipts from this field will be $50 an
acre or $2000.
Other reports of f-iirly good fields
of w^ieat in both Williams and Mc
Kenzie county are frequently heard.
Flax is said tor be looking fine and
corn and hay are certain to produce
an abundance of feed.
It will be a source of delight to
hear them sing: Like a Like (Sweet
Constancy), Walilana (Drowsv Wa
ters), the enchanting farewell love
song, Aloha oe, My Old Kentucky
Home and many more of our own be
loved ballads.

SUPT. AND BOARD ARRANGE
FOR GOOD OF GREATEST NUM
BER—33 INSTRUCTORS
Two additional third grades are
added to the school system this year.
Both will be located at the Central
grounds, occupying the east rooms
of the present high school building.
While there have been two second
grades in the West Lawn school, some
of those children can this year be ac
commodated at Central. All children
who have been in one of the second
grades in West Lawn school during
the past year, may enter one of the
third grades at Central this fall. It
is understood that this is not obliga
tory, but optional, tho' it is preferable
that only enough continue at West
Lawn school to make a jcrade
dinary size. Some readjustment may
be necessary after the enrollment is
taken, but every effort will be made
to meet the convenience of the great
est number. The reason for the plan
of placing three third grades in Cen
tral, and one in West Lawn is found
in the belief of the board of education
and the superintendent that this will
accommodate a larger number of
homes, than would be done, should, the
sixth grade be entirely removed f~"om
West Lawn as had beer: considered.
There is then, no change in Lhe lo
cation of the West Lawn sixth tirade
pupils. They continue at West Lawn
school. The superintendent will be
pleased to give needed explanations
if the announcement is not clear.
The corps of teachers for the com
ing school year numbers thirty three,
and is now complete. There have
been few changes, and the ^orps is
considered unusually strong. Two of
the number are unable to stare with
the opening of school, but by substi
tution and other provisions, all ar-'
rangements are complete.
Pupils of all the schools who have
work in manual training of any type,
or domestic art, or other form of
school work, are urged to brim' tho™
to the Central school by Monday. If
they cannot readily be brought to the
school, a phone message to the school
office giving notice of thp exhibit
work, will suffice and it will be sent
for. Assurance is given that all work
will be carefully looked after and
cared for.

Enjoyed Evening
At Song And Story
Several members of the local Burns
Club met at the home of Geo. Lakie
on 4th Ave. west, last Saturday even
ing and spent the time in reciting,
story-telling, and song, until the "wee
sma' hours ayont the twal," and it
is safe to say that none went away
with any secret regrets. It was an en
joyable occasion of which every one
present took full advantage.
The host recited several selections
from Burns as only George Lakie can,
an accomplishment of which any one
possessing it should feel proud. 'Die
recitations were interspersed with
songs by Mr. Quinn and story telling
by all. It was deeply regretted by
those present that, those who would
have enjoyed it the most found it
impossible to be there.
At the proper time, the subject of
al Burns celebration was re-opened,
and, while the members present show
ed some degree of apathy and diffi
q"- denco in the beginning, it was not
long until they had warmed to the
subject and became enthusiastic sup
porters of the idea, the final arrange
ments for which will be consummated
at the next meeting of the club, the
evening of the last Saturday in Octo
ber. Notices will be sent out in ample
time that all who wish, may take part
in the anniversary proceedings, Jan.
25, 1917, but it is especially desirable
that you come to the next meeting.
We would like to enroll as many
new members as possible between
this and the next meeting, so, if you
have any desire to join the Club, ask
the Secretary for an application
blank, fill it out, and together with
the membership fee of $2, send it to
the Secretary who will be glad to
present it to the members for their
acceptance.
Remember that the final arrange
ments for the annual celebration will
be completed at the next meeting, in
Oct., and do not forget the date, the
last Saturday evening of that month.
teams that occupied the field Friday
night were equal if not superior to
the state pennant contenders. This
is not a matter of opinion, but is prov

that each team averaged two and
three-fourths runs per inning which
is far above the season average of the
famous teams mentioned.
Marshall and Seibert were the op­
mark for the heavy hitters that con

knocked out of the box and succeeded
by twirlers who fared but little bet

O. E. Kron, formerly of Minot, has
taken the local agency for the Willys
Overland car, and has opened a
earage on East Broadway and fitted
it up to provide service for owners
of the widely advertised and famous
make of automobile.
The management is confident that
the exhibits in every department wjll
exceed all previous efforts and will
make the purely agricultural features
of tho fair a pleasant surprise for ajl
visitors. The farm club displays
alone will make a great showing but
it is hoped that these will not deter
individual exhibitors from showing
their products.'
Auto Itaccs Assured
Automobile races, which have been
a big attraction at the last two fairs,
will be held each day and there is as
surance of four and probably six en
tries. The liberal prizes, as shown
in a display advertisement in this is
sue, are certain to make the races
stubbornly contested.
Feature Events
Besides the horse and auto races
there will be a wealth of feature
events Such as the always amusing
Merchant's Derby, Farmer's Slow
Race, bucking contests and saddle
horse races.
A carnival company will have on
the grounds a long list of concessions
such as always please the youngsters

trained animal shows.
Need of Funds
In speaking of the 1916 fair, for
the success of which he has worked
so hard, Secy. Morrill said:
Even considering the handicap un
der which the Fair Association di
rectors are laboring due to the lack
of proper finances, the fair promises
this year to be better and larger than
