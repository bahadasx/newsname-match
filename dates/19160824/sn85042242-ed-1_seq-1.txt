Useless.

DISTANCE 1,000 FEET
Not One Is Ready for Service,
But Commissioners Have Over­
paid Contractor.
WHERE THE COUNTY'S
ROAID AND BRIDGE MONEY GOES
To build four concrete bridges
not needed at an expense which
may reach $20,000.
To advertise for bids and then
have the plans changed, with no
competitve bidding on the final
contract.
To pay a contractor almost
twice as much as the original bid
called for.
To go to useless expense In
grading approaches to bridges
when by a detour of less than
1,000 feet all could be avoided.
Four concrete bridges are being er­
ected on the Red Trail at Apple creek
at a cost which may exceed $210,000,
Road experts declare that by making
a detour of less than 1,000 feet the
county commisioners could have
avoided the bridges and given the
public a better road at an expense
which would have been only the, cost
of the right of way.
Government engineers always re­
commend ratfter
than hauling' it down, and going
around a creek, river or small lake
rather than going to the expense of
erecting a -bridge. They urge that
ttte rp*d work be so planned out be­
fore &ny steps at improvement are
taken that as much of the money as
possible in the actual grading, gravel­
ing or in' other ways finishing off a
road bed.
No Complaint
For 20 years drivers on the nation­
al highway have made the slight de­
tour around the creek and not made a
complaint. The land is high and the
road exceptionally good, better than
it is in any other section of the Bur­
leigh county stretch of the Red Trail
save that which the road gang has
worked this spring.
An avalanche of complaints have
been shot at the county commissioners
about the road through the McKenzie
slough and other places where cul­
verts and grading are needed but
these have been ignored while the
money has been expended for purely
ornamental bridges.
Score Waste.
Road users declare that they would­
n't raise their voices against the con­
crete structures if the rest of the trail
was perfect, but when the ten miles
of almost impassable road is consider­
ed they feel that the time has come
to call a halt in the extravagance and
waste of county funds.
The original contract was given to
M. P. Moore, the lowest bidder, at
$11,200. The plans and specifications
on which the contract was based were
drawn by the county board's engineer.
New Plans Drawn.
But immediately afterward the
plans and specifications were chang­
ed, providing, it is said, for heavier
steel reinforcement and deeper piling.
This threw out the old contract, but
bids were not readvertised for. Mr.
Moore was allowed to take the work,
additional compensation to be provid­
ed for according to the recommenda­
tions of the engineer on the basis of
the extra work done.
The county has Already paid more
than $12,000 for the work, more than
the original bid, supposedly based on
sound plans and specifications, and
not one of the bridges is ready for
traffic. Two are nearly finished and
one of the others is coming along
nicely.
Will Cost 120,000.
Road men place the final cost, bas­
ed on the money expended for the
work already completed, at about
$20,000. The county commissioners
can, however, experts declare, by tak­
ing the matter in hand and cutting
every useless expenses from now on,
cut down the cost materially.
'Besides the money expended for the
bridges, a considerable outlay must
be made for approaches, which would
not have been necessary if the pres­
ent little curve was maintained and
the creek avoided.
Ruts Untouched.
A little beyond these unfinished
spanways is the lake on the other
side of Field's farm. Here the road
makes a long detour and runs into the
wire fence along the railroad track.

Gap in Country's Defense Brought
Out in Battle Between
U. S. Fleets.
SUPPLIES OF "BLUE"
CONTINGENT CAPTURED
Washington, Aug. 2S.—The navy
department was taxing its resources
tonight to fill up the first hypothet­
ical gap in the country's defense,
which has developed in the national
war game in progress off the Atlantic
coast. Hff!
Theoretically, a mob of uniformed
men today overpowered the naval
guard at Sewall Point, on Hampton
Roads, destroyed great stores of coal
and supplies collected here for possi­
ble use of the "Blue" defending fleet,
and burned the piers.
The paymaster general, .being im­
mediately informed of this disaster,
set his forces to work to locate new
stores of coal and supplies and to
find means for sending them to some
point on the Roads at the earliest
possible moment. The problem re­
quires that actual supplies be found
and the possibiliity of getting them
forward promptly be figured out in
order to test the machinery of the
department.
While naval forces ashore were
dealing with this angle of the game,
Rear Admiral Helm was still sweep­
ing the seas with his scouts, in a
southeasterly direction from Xarra
gansett, the base from which he sail­
ed yesterday morning, in an effort to
repel Admiral Mayo's "Red" fleet.
Presumably, the "Blue" scouts were
within 300 miles of the enemy's last
known place, according to the report,
but no report that "Red" 'battle craft
had been sighted reached the depart­
ment up to a late hour.

The flercG struggle aroung Fleury,

Both Berlin and London continue to

a torpedo from an English submarine,
but maintains that the damage was
slight. The German admiralty reiter­

Suggests Increased Freight Rates.
One of the means for recouping sug­
gested by the president to the rail­
roads, in his public outline of his posi­
tion, was through an increase In
freight rates. It was pointed out to­
night that the president cannot direct­
ly ask the Interstate Commerce com­
mission to grant increases to the rail
rpads. Congress might pass a resolu­
tion directing the commission, in view
of what it considers an unprecedent­
ed situation, to grant higher rates.
Congress might also pass a resolu­
tion directing the commission to in­
vestigate all matters involved in the
present controversy, and the whole
subject of the relations of the rail­
roads and their employes. One result
expected from today's conference is
an early effort to pass the bill intro­
duced several months ago to increase
the commission's membership from
seven to nine.
Point Must Be Conceded.
It became evident tonight that most
of the railroad executives have come
to believe that there can be only one
way of preventing a strike, and that
is by accepting the eight-hour day
plan. The chief effort to their own
conferences today was to find some
scheme by which an eight-hour day
may be out in operation on all the
railroads at the least added expense.
Many suggestions along this line have
ben made by the presidents, but no
one of them has proved feasible when
submitted to the acid *est of operat­
ing officials.
It is well understood that most of
the executives now are convinced
that the eight-hour day in some form
must be conceded, and that they can­
not expect President Wilson to recede
from the position he has publicly tak­
en.

CAPT. KOENIC AND HIS
E CREW ARE SAFE AT
Edward W. Morrison, Multi-Mil­
lionaire, Named Father
of Chicago Girls.
HAD KNOWN THEM
ALL HIS LIFE
Chicago, Aug. 23.—Edward W. Mor­
rison, a multimillionaire recluse, was
named as the real father of two girls
he recently adopted in proceedings to­
day before Judge Landis of the Unit­
ed States district court.
The accuser was Joseph Burnstein,
a junk dealer, and husband of the
girls' mother. His wife, he declared,
confessed to him on her deathbed
that Morrison was the father of the
girls. The millionaire, who is nearly
80 years old, denied the accusation.
His reason for adopting the girls, he
testified, was that their mother had
pleaded with him when taken ill to
take care of them. He had known
them all their lives, he said, and was
fond of them.
"Morrison attended my wife's fu­
neral with me in June," Burnstein
testified. "I told him of my wife's
confession. Morrison said: 'Very
well, I'll fix it up with you.'"
The action before Judge Landis
was a petition to appoint a receiver
for Morrison's property, which has
been variously estimated at from
$3000,000 to
$3,0'00,'0'00.

History of the Deutschland.
The German super submarine
Deutschland—pioneer undersea mer­
chantman-—was the first of a fleet of
submersiblp'! built to thp order of tho
Deutsche Ozean Rhederel G. M, B. H.,
Bremen, and is said to have cosit
$500,000.
Alfred Lohman, president of the
Bremen chamber of commerce,, con­
ceive^ the Jdeiw of the aadi!mr-»w
chaatman in the fall of IMS.' A^ eoel
pany WM immediately formed aodthja
construction of the submarines in­
trusted to the Germaniawerft, Kiel.
The Deutschland was 315 feet leas
with 30-foot beam. She had a gton
tonnage of 791, net 447. Her esti­
mated carrying capacity was about
900 tons.
Two six-cylinder Delsel oil burning
engines, each developing 500-horae
power, furnished her driving power.
Her speed was 14 knots an hour when
on surface and about seven when sub­
merged.
The machinery of the submersible
ran down almost the entire center be­
tween two storage compartments, one
at each end, and between two long
freight compartments that lined her
saddle-back sides.
The engines were located just aft
the center of the vessel below the
compressed air tanks. The batteries
occupy a similar position forward.
The officers' quarters, fitted in wal­
nut, with comfortable bunks and all
the comforts of a liner's cabin, were
just aft the batteflei. The diving ap­
paratus was just lift of the engines.
The conning tower was almost di­
rectly above the center of the keel.
The vessel carried two masts of a
type that fit snugly in a groove on
deck when not in use. One of these
carried a crow's nest and when
straightened aloft was about 100 feet
tall. The portable wireless antennae
was strung between the masts.
The Deutschland was built to stay
under water 196 hours. On her trip
to the United States she left Helcp
land on June 3 and arrived in Balti­
more July 10. She brought a cargo 4
dye stuffs valued at $1,000,000. On the
return trip she carried a cargo oC
nickel and crude rubber.
She carried a crew of 29 men, in­
cluding Capt. Paul Koenlg.
