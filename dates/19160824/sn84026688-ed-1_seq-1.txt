GERMAN SKY MERCHANTMEN MAY
SOON VISIT THE UNITED STATES
The Transatlantic Zeppelin and the Cargo-Carrying Airship, No
Longer Technical possibilities, They Are Probabilities—Ger
many Constructs New Super-Zeppelin of Great Speed
and Increased Freight-Carrying Capacity.
New York. —Is the cargo-carrying
Zeppelin coming next? A cable report
auys It la, and perhaps people might
Just as well pocket their scepticism,
alt tight and prepare to welcome the
aerial wondercraft. The doubting
Thomases were bowled over for keeps
wheu the U-boat Deutschland poked
her nose in through the capes of the
Chesapeake, and, without other aid
than her beautifully running Diesel
motors, headed for Baltimore at a
tidy clip, writes Robert G. Skerrltt In
the New York Sun.
Tbe transatlantic Zeppelin and the
cargo-carrying airship are no longer
merely technical possibilities; they
are probabilities. Credible reports
from abroad bear this statement out.
The fact Is the Germans have lately
completed and tested a naval super-
Zeppelin, one of a numerous class now
under construction, which surpasses
by a wide margin anything of the kind
heretofore built by the Teutons. So
far In advance Is this type that the
spanning of the Atlantic becomes
measurably near.
The Germans have striven hard to
keep the details of this monster air
craft from the outside world, but the
Inevitable leak has developed via Luke
Constance—that body of water over
which the Germans and the Swiss ex
ercise a divided sovereignty. An en
terprising Swiss journalist learned of
what was going on at Frledrlchshnfeu,
and his story was promptly printed.
Despite diplomatic efforts the paper
got abroad and the Information Is now
available here.
New Super-Zeppelin,
Some Idea of what the newest Zep
pelin, or rather super-Zeppelin, repre
sents In the way of aeronautic devel
opment can be gathered from the fact
that the cubical capacity of her gas
bugs Is 100 per cent greater than that
of the largest naval Zeppelin lu com
mission when war was declared. That
Is to say, this titan of the air can
stow 54.000 cubic meters of gas within
her aluminum outer hull. This repre
sents a lifting power equal to the
raising of substantially 61 tons. The
dead weight of the vessel Is a matter
of 40 tons, and lu the language of the
technlclst this leaves a margin of 21
tons for the carriage of useful loud.
Until the advent of this super-lype
the longest Zeppelin hud a total
length of 468 feet and a gas content of
from 19,000 to 20,000 cubic meters.
The airship which lately made suc
cessful trips over Lake Constance
has a hull nearly 788 feet long.
And In the matter of shape, Count
Zeppelin has made a decided departure
from his previous dirigibles. He has
chosen a model that offers a much
lower resistance to the air, and there
fore per unit of horsejKiwer he ob
tains a speedier and wlthul a more
manageable and economic craft.
Considered from a military point of
view these gains are of the greatest
importance. With controlnblllty and
added speed the builder secures longer
range, added weatherllness and powers
of offense and defense of an excep
tional order.
Driven by Seven Propellers.
According to the cabled reports the
super-Zeppelin Is driven by seven pro
pellers. There are three on each side,
supported laterally by outstanding fins,
and the seventh propeller projects aft
from the rear gondola. This arrange
ment Is Influenced by the modified
form of the after body of the hull.
The super-Zeppelin has three gon
dolas In which are placed the motive
power and a fourth gondola or central
control station which Is partly housed
within the body of the keel. The lat
ter forms In addition to the backbone
of the craft a connecting passageway
fore and aft by which all of the cars
can be reached under cover.
The gondolas are all armored with
thin steel plating of a special sort
which has unusual defensive proper
ties. The central station or car Is the
navigational position and also the
point from which bombs or a new type
of aerial torpedo can be launched. The
launching apparatus reflects the ex
perience of the war. The discharge Is
Controlled electrically and It Is said
that much greater accuracy In hitting
Is obtainable than has been possible
heretofore.
Each of the engine-bearing gondolas
carries an armament consisting of a
new model of semiautomatic gun and
n number of machine guns. But there
are other directions In which the
super-Zeppelin has increased her pow
ers of attack. Forward and aft on
each Bide are boused rapld-flrers.
These are Installed Inside recesses
within the outer envelope and are nor
mally concealed. In time of action,
the sheltering cover Is dropped and
the guns stand out where they can
command wide angles of fire laterally
and In a vertical plane. This Is a dis
tinct departure.
Offensive and Defensive.
On top of the airship, near the bow.
Is an eighth gun emplacement, and
the weapons there are machine guns
and a novel type of small rapid-fire
mortars. This feature Is designed to
deal particularly with attacking aero
planes that might seek to assail the
dirigible from aloft the most prom

ising avenue of approach hitherto.
The mortars throw a new order of
aerial bomb which Is said to he mure
effective than shrapnel In dialing with
heavler-thuu-alr flying machines. The
maximum elevation of these pieces
gives a nearly overhead fire.
During the tests over Frledrlchshufeu
on Luke Constance the super-Zeppelin
showed that she was capable of mount
ing aloft at an astonishing speed and
a maximum altitude of 15,000 feet was
attained. With her nose pointed up
ward and her engines adding their
lift to the buoyant gas in the bugs, tbe
dirigible climbed skyward at the rate
of 2,000 feet a minute.
Tbe aeroplane that cun ascend at a
velocity of 800 feet a minute is doing
well.
Tbe super-Zeppelin will cover the
entire field of aerial scouting. She
cuu do this without fear of inter
ference from below. The best of the
anti-aircraft guns have a vertical
range of but 10,000 feet, while the
newest Zeppelins cun mount securely
to an added height of 5,000 feet.
At a height of 5,000 feet an observer
over tbe water has a radius of ob
servation of something like 80 miles.
From such a coign of vantage It would
be extremely easy to watch the fall of
shot at ranges of 15,000 yards and
more. It gives to the gunner afloat
the power of telling hits by indirect
fire, assuming that a bank of fog In
tervened. The admiral without such
means of aerial spotting Is to all lu
teuts and purposes blind.
Send and Receive Wireless.
It must be remembered that while
the aeroplane can dispatch wireless
messages It Is Incapable of receiving
them owing to the racket made by Us
noisy engines. The Zeppelin, on the
other hand, is not so hampered, and
therefore can both transmit and re
ceive wireless communications.
The super-Zeppelin of the latest pat
tern curries a crew numbering some
thing like 40 all told. During cruis
ing periods half of these men are
on duty at a time. All of them are
engaged only when the aircraft Is In
action and every gun manned.
Heretofore the cruising endurance of
the Zeppelins has been roundly a mat
ter of 1,000 nautical miles. The greatly
Increased buoyancy of the super-Zep
pelin suggests that It will be entirely
practicable to carry more than double
the proportion of fuel per unit of horse
power. Not only this, but the im
proved form of the hull has greatly re
duced the air resistance and therefore
augmented the propulsive effort of the
engines. It is not Improbable that the
dirigible which made her maiden trial
trip a month ago Is able to cover si too
thing like 3,000 knots before replenish
ing her supplies.
Just ns the fighting submarine
blazed the way for the cargo-currying
submarine Deutschland, so the newest
super-Zeppelin points logically to the
practicability of n transatlantic flight
and the carriage of either passengers
or cargo. Of course, the quantity of
freight would be relatively less than
that of a submarine of commerce, but
then the element of time saved and
the value of the freight might easily
make a service of that sort well worth
the while. Indeed, It Is quite conceiv
able that the aerial trader could make
the journey from continent to conti
nent with far less likelihood of cap
ture or Interference than that menac
ing tbe under-water cargo carrier.
Navigation Problemr Solved.
The transatlantic aerial freighter
would be stripped of Its military char
acter Just as bus been done In the ease
of the U-boat Deutschland, and this
would Increase the possible profit
making cargo. The navigational prob
lems need not balk the Germans. The
work the kaiser’s Zeppelins have
already done both In time of peace and
during the present conflict has shown
tbe sureness with which the boats
can be guided night or day from point
to point. Long before the outbreak
of hostilities the passenger-carrying
Zeppelin Victoria Lulse made more
than 400 trips, and up to the four hun
dredth run covered nearly 30,000 miles,
carrying upon each run 21 passengers.
With all of the experience gained since
then, what may not the advent of the
super-Zeppelin augur?

How Much Is Now Left of the Bal
timore Platform?
The President had boldly signed ths
Pork River and Harbor bill, and his
facile pen is dripping with ink eager
to attach itself to a Pork Public
Buildings bill.
The friendliest apologists of the
President’s part In the profligate
waste of money wrung from the peo
pie by oppressive taxation have noth
ing better to say for him than that
It Is hardly fair to expect a man to
say “I forbid!” In this Presidential
year when he Is a candidate.
The foregoing words describing ths
profligate waste of the people’s money
with Executive approval are taken
without change from a plank of ths
platform on which Woodrow Wilson
was elected In 1912:
"We denounce the profligate waste
of money wrung from the people by
oppressive taxation through the
lavish appropriations of recent Re
publican Congresses, which have
kept taxes high and reduced the
purchasing power of the people’*
toll. We demand a return to that
simplicity and economy which be
fits a democratic government.”
How much Is now left of the prin
ciples declared and the promises reg
istered at Baltimore as Inducements
to citizens to vote for Wilson.
Possibly It Is because he and his
party have been such reckless, such
wholesale repudlators of the pledges
of 1912 that few people remember or
care to remember what pledges were
made In his behalf about forty days
ago at St. Louis. —New York Sun.

|| “AUF WiEDERSEHN”
By EARL REED SILVERS.
They sat Id the swinging couch of
the Country club veranda. Mildred
Terrill spoke first.
“We haven’t been together at a
dance for five weeks,” she said.
"No,” he answered, “not since you
cut the last waltz at the Assembly
ball.”
“Are you still angry about that?”
“Yes.” Cliff Hillman’s Ups were
compressed tightly.
“I didn’t do It purposely.” She
looked at him with big, appeallug
eyes.
"No, It was worse than that. You
Just forgot me."
‘‘Will yon let me explain?"
“I don't see that there's anything
you can say to better It.”
“But there Is.”
“What?” He looked gloomily over
the rolling golf links.
“I didn't know that the last daace
had started. I was walking with Ar
thur between dunces, and we went
Just a little too fur. We couldn’t hear
the music where we were.”
“Do you know what the waltz was
that you forgot?"
“It was ‘Auf Wledersehn.' ’’
“Yes, our dunce." He turned to her
directly. “Do you remember how,
when we lirst heard that piece, you
said that we should always daace it
together?”
“Yes, I remember.”
“I was crazy about you that night,
and ‘Auf Wledersehn' was the most
wonderful dance I hud ever heard.
You seemed to care a lot then.”
“I did.” If he had seen the light In
her eyes, he would have thrilled at
the message It conveyed. But he wus
looking Into the distance.
"And still, Just a week later, you
cut It to go walking with Arthur
Hale.”
"What’s past Is past,” she contin
ued. “Don't you want to be good
friends again?"
I “Of course, but It Isn’t much use
now."
“Why?"
“Because of something I heard."
"What was It?"
“I heard this morning,” he spoke
slowly, "that you are engaged to Ar
thur Hale.”
"It Isn’t true; I'm not engaged to
any one." She looked fairly Into his
brooding eyes.
"I’m glad." He smiled for the first
time during Hie conversation. "Maybe
we might have ‘Auf Wledersehn’ to
gether tonight,” he suggested.
She glanced at the order In her
hand.
"It’s the tenth dance," she said hesi
tatingly, "and I am to have that with
! Arthur.”
| He scowled.
' “I knew It. And that was always
going to be our dunce."
“I’m sorry."
“I'm sorry, too.” He rose as the
orchestra struck up u lively fox trot.
"Here comes Arthur now," he said.
“This Is probably his dance, too.”
“Yes, It Is." She hesitated. “May
be —” she began. But before she could
1 speak further Arthur Hale appeared
on the scene.
The girl threw a glance over her
shoulder ns she walked away, hut
Cliff did not see her. He was think
ing of "Auf Wledersehn” and all that
It had meant to him.
While the others were dancing, he
walked to the end of the porch and
seated himself in the shadows. The
1 music died away, but he did not stir.
' Suddenly he heard a girl’s voice. It
| wus Mildred’s.
"Do you mind,” she was saying, "If
I give the tenth dance away?"
) "Of course 1 do.” Arthur spoke
j with the self-assurance which was his
most notable characteristic. "That’s
I ‘Auf Wledersehn,’ ami It’s mine.”
I "No,” the girl said, "not yours. I’m
sorry, but I’ll have to give It away."
"What?" The man’s voice rang out
angrily.
“You have ten others, and I think
you cun very easily give one away.
At any rate, I'm going to take It.”
“Well, of course you can do what
you want to.”
“And you won’t bo angry?”
“Yes, 1 shall be."
“Well, you'll have to be then." She
spoke as If she didn’t care. “I’m go
ing to give It to Clifford.”
“Who?”
"To Clifford Hillman."
“Oh, so you’re going back to him?"
There was a sueer in his voice.
“I think you’ve said enough, Ar
thur." She spoke quietly.
“I beg your pardon." Hale accepted
his defeat like a man. *TTI see if 1
cun find him for you."
“Thank you I I'll wait here.”
After he had gone, Cliff emerged
from the shadows.
"Mildred 1" he said.
“Oh!” She blushed deeply. "Did
you hear what I said.”
“Yes,” he answered.
When Hale came back to tell Mll
! dred that his search was In vain, be
could not find her, for she wus hidden
In the shadow’s which bordered the
golf links.
The ninth dance was Just starting
when she and Cliff returned to the
veranda. She glanced at her card.
“This with Arthur,” she said. "I
must tell him."
"And the next Is'Auf Wledersehn.”’
“Yes,” she answered, "the next Is
our dance.” She laid her hand on his
arm. "Good-by, dear," she whispered.
"Till we meet again,” he returned.

HARO WORK ON THE FARM
Many Middle-Aged Men WIN Remem.
bar the Tribulations Consequent
on “Haying" Tims.
July was once a period dreaded b)
the American country boy, as the time
of “haying.” To be sure It was re
lieved by the turbulent and explosive
Joys of July 4. But every other day,
often In flie concentrated hours of
the national birthday, he was driven
to the hayfield with rake and fork.
How bis heart rebelled against the
humdrum toll!
By one of the mysterious dispensa
tions of Providence, the smallest boys
were put to work In the most exhaust
ing post. While the older men were
down on the barn floor where the cool
breezes swept In from the wide open
doors, It was the function of the boys
to receive the hay under the eaves
of the structure and push and trample
It down In the smallest possible com
pass. Only by much treading could
the dried grasses be compressed Into
a reasonable space.
It was a perfect Inferno of heat,
the air filled with choking dust, the
mow baking from the sun beating on
the roof. With no particle of breath
from out of doors It was like the fur
nace where walked Shadrach, Meshach
and Abednego of old Bible times.
The men down below seemed pos
itively to gain satisfaction from
covering them up with -fast coming
forkfuls of the dusty hay.
Still there were certain alleviations.
The can of Iced water sweetened with
New Orleans molasses and spiced with
ginger from the pantry Is still re
called. Also at the close there was
an Elyslan dip In the swimming hole.
Today the youth may swing In the
hammock with the summer boarders,
while Polish and Swedish farm hands
perform these tasks for which their
physique Is ample, greatly lightened
by modern machinery. But certain
habits of toilsome Industry that gained
their hold In the father's soul from
the regular performance of such hard
labor may be lacking In the son.—

MOST FAITHFUL OF FRIENDS
Love of Dog, Once Gained, la Never
Forfeited, Though Fortune May
Smile or Frown.
A dog worthy of the name Is of all
animals that walks on two legs or on
four the creature least affected by the
mutations of fortune, says the Phila
delphia Ledger. “Caesar” In the
funeral cortege of King Edward VII,
was not more sorrowfully proud of his
place than a dog faithful at the grave
of a tinker whom he has followed
In all weathers. Your dog does not
regard your clothes nor explore your
pockets. He takes you on faith—
blind faith: you are his king, Incap
able of wrong. He reads his heaven
on earth In your approving counte
nance.
No ribbon or medal can take the
measure of the sentiment of the true
dog lover toward his most faithful
friend of all. When the rest of the
world Is cold and hard, his dog will
still rejoice to meet him when he
comes home at night. His dog will
think no evil, whatever the master may
do. It Is a wonderful thing for a man
to experience a trust so absolute and
so unfaltering. Who shall call It a
dumb brute whose eyes and paws are
■o eloquent and whose love speaka
In a look?

Who Invented the phrase the “Nel

again In connection with the North

that It probably originated In Nelson’s
family circle at Merton, and the first
frequent use of It occurred In the great
seaman’s correspondence with Lady
Hamilton, as where, writing Just be
fore reaching the fleet, he remarked:
“I am anxious to Join, for It would add
to my grief If any other man was
to give them the Nelson touch, which
we say Is warranted never to full.”

How the Wilson
Administration Has
Penalized Patriotism
"Having In view the possibility of
further aggression upon the territory
of the United States from Mexico and
the necessity for the proper protec
tion of that frontier,” President Wil
son, on June 18, called out the mobile
arms of the National Guard for federal
service.
He did not call them out at their
existing peace strength, but at war
strength, which is practically double.
Lacking a system of reserves, the
National Guard organizations Immedi
ately had to start a campaign of re
cruiting, to bring about the desired In
crease in their numbers.
Patriotic young citizens, under the
urge of the cry, “Your country needs
you,” volunteered for service in grati
fying numbers. According to Senator
Chamberlain, chairman of the Senate
Committee on Military Affairs, the re
sult Is that about 135,000 citizen sol
diers have been mustered Into the
federal service and are now on the
Mexican border or In camp In their
home states. There may be more, but
the administration refuses to make
known the exact figures.
The movement is costing the public
. treasury many millions of dollars; It
Is costing the Individual citizen sol
diers many millions more. They went
to the front believing the cry, "Your
country needs you,” for war service.
They sacrificed advancement in their
civil occupations, severed home ties,
suffered. In thousands of Instances,
great financial loss. The lesis pa
triotic. who did not believe the cry, or
believing, declined to make sacrifices,
fatten at home on these losses.
The real purposes of the call are
slowly developing. They are two la
number;
First, a patrol of the border to do
the work which President Wilson’s
friend, Carranza, finds It Impossible
to do. Because the recognized govern
ment In Mexico Is too ineffective to
keep its own citizens in check and
prevent them murdering Americans
on American soil, the American gov
ernment undertakes the costly task ot
doing that work for them. The mur
der of American citizens on Mexican
soil Is another matter. Carranza may
go as far as he likes In that direction.
Second, a purpose of the mobiliza
tion on the border and In the camps
Is to train citizens to perform effective
military service. The regular military
establishment of the nation Is mani
festly too small for the actual military
needs. To this extent the cry, “Your
country needs you,” was correct.
But these facts were not made clear
when the call was issued. The Idea
was promulgated that men were need
ed for actual war service; not for
military training. Deceit was prac
ticed.
Opposing in the open legislation for
universal military service, the admin
istration by Its acts has established
what In essence Is a system of com
pulsory military service. It Is a sys
tem all the more vicious because It
operates only against the patriotic,
whereas a legalized universal training
system equalizes the burden of mili
tary service among all men and all
classes of men.
When, In 1914, Europe plunged Into
the greatest war of all history, and
conditions In Mexico grew Intolerable,
intelligent men realized the fact that
It was Incumbent on this nation to
build up Its tiny regular army and put
Its other military resources In condi
tion for use. National safety demanded
this. And yet, In December of that
year, four months after the European
war began, President Wilson went be
fore Congress and declared that all
agitation for military preparedness
was hysterical; that we were ade
quately prepared.
After a while the administration
changed Its mind and professed to
believe in the necessity for prepared
ness. First came an enactment to
increase the regular army by 20,000.
But the body of the country, and even
all parts of the Democratic adminis
tration, could not change front so
quickly as the head. Recruiting for
the regular army lagged. Not yet
have the 20,000 been secured.
The need pressed. A new national
defense act, providing for still more
men In the regular army, was enacted.
But still the men were not forthcom
ing.
Suddenly and without warning tha
administration Issued its call for mo
bilization of the citizen soldiery. It
seemed stlfl obsessed with the Bryan
notion that an army could be created
by presidential ukase.
When the call went out the govern
ment did not own enough uniforms,
shoes, socks, blankets, hats, wagons,
trucks, horses, mules and other things
essential to equip the men called; it
had made no provision for- transport
ing the troops called to the points
where they were required.
Who suffered most by this amaz
ing lack of foresight, this leaping be
fore looking?
Only the 136,000 patriots who be
lieved that their country needed them
for national defense; only the men
who are making the great sacrifices.
The whole disgraceful story may
be summed up In the phrase, ths
administration has penalized patriot
ism.
True, It Is accumulating, by sub
terfuge, a reserve of trained soldie-s,
hut events have demonstrated that It
cried “wolf’’ when there was no wolf.
Should It be forced to cry "wolf"
again, when the wolf 1s at the door,
what wIU be the result?
