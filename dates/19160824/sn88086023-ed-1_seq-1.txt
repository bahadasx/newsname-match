ASSESSED VALUATION IN
CITY LESS THAN IN 1915
Reduction in Valuation of
Buildings Responsible; To-
tal Koll of County to be
Larger, Says Assessor
In a report to th city council last
night County Assessor C. 1'. Strain
announced that, while it is not pos
sible to tell the exact valuation of the
property in the city this year. It will
probably be less than in 1915 and
more than in 1914. The assessor re
cently made a general reduction in the
valuation of all but new buildings
which cuts down the city total. The
estimated valuation will probably
reach $8,780,000, he said.
In the county the reductions made
in the irrigated fruit districts, he said,
will be more than offset by the new
ly constructed Coytc cutoff which will
give the county ten miles of addition
ul main line railroad.
Strain declared that the average
increase of personal property during
the past few years has been $200,004
yearly and the Increase this year would
be greater because of the unusual
quantity Of wheat carried over. The
assessment roll in the county will be
the largest ever, he Stated,
