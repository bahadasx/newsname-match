WASHINGTON, August 24. ? TIlO
politieluiiH here from West Vlrglula

Stale ('Imlrmnn Charles C. I as wis and
corlain Democratic leaders, some of
wnoill arc canuitiiiM'r mm imvv u kuuh

the fuss will lie. iJ
The trouble has lioen caused by t
Chairman l/cwls demanding, and Insisting
upon his demand In an almost
auloenille way, that the personality of
Wood row Wilson shall bo inado tlto
doniliiant personal element in the canvas
of Ills party la the slate and that
natlnnal issues shall share an equal
prominence with state Issues. That Is
the hone of eontoiitlnn, and over It a
high stale of dudgeon has been aroused.
This Is particularly true as It affects
certain enmlldalos for state and
congressional ofllces on tho Democratic
lleket who bad planned tholr
speeches and their campaign methods l;
generally quite along different lines
than those Insisted hy Chairman IjCIVIs
should he followed.
Disregard lam Is.
As a matter of fact tlieso candidates
.....I ,?.,noimiiu tiflnw I llunnlntr In

that the)', would, us far tut possible nittl
practicable, Ignore Wilson In their
speeches, and with a few meaningless
generalities ]>ut national Issues In the
background, and strike out on state |H
Issues tvith n view to win Republican
support on the argument that the stato
government was last In tho fetters of
a selllsh gang of political highbinders,
whoso reilrcnicnt from power was a ,H
thing ns much to ho dcslrod by llopublicans
as by lltosc who do not Inlong

of cnurso, thoso who hold office,

with a fake liberalism calculated to , I^B

Rut this was not the Lewis Idea of - ijB
It as has been shown, and therefore- . :|
the conlrovcrsy. The stato chairman,
whoso reputation for political acumont
ind whoso nblltty for successful party
management are yet to be demonstaled,
Is firmly of the opinion that
tVoodrow Wilson Is the high-card per- , vj
tonality to play up lo West Virginia ,'otern,
nnd that Woodrow Wilson's administration
Is the magnet to draw a
majority of votes Into the Democratic '
:olumn. Those who disagree with hlB . v;l
