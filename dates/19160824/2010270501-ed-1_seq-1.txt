Jlmmle Washington, well known
Alliance colored lad, whose mother
doea odd Jobs and takes In washing
for her support, and whose wife and
child are now In Denver, was arrest
ed Tuesday morning by Marshal
Wheeler and later admitted a list of
crimes committed in the last two
months which will undoubtedly land
him in the penitentiary for a good,
long term.
Howard Latemura, a private in
the quartermaster's department,
Twelfth cavalry, stationed at Fort
Robinson, took a months furlough
Monday and started out to aee the
chountry. He landed first In Alliance
and proceeded to tank up on red
eye. He had checked his baggage
through to Alliance and claims that
he Intended to get a position here
working in a garage, aa be ia an au
tomobile mechanic.
Latemura had a gold watch and
24 in money on hla person, in addi
tion to hla baggage check. He went
to sleep In an alley and when he
awoke was short the watch, cash and
check. Washington had been seen
n his v'clnlty and suspicion centered
on him at once. When the poltce
searched his home they found the
gold watch but no sign of coin or
check. He waa locked up and fur
ther investigation made.
Washington had been employed at
the Alliance hotel for some time,
during which time several raincoats,
suitcases and some hotel linen was
missed. Further search of the house
revealed two of the missing suitcases
which were packed full Of the stolen
goods. The two . suitcases were
worth about $25 and the linen re
covered was worth about $40. Washi
ngton admitted taking the linen but
said that when he found the hotel
marks on it he had intended to re
turn it.
A quantity of liquor had also been
missed from the Homer Wilson sa
loon. Washington had been observ
ed "bootlegging" and confessed to
helping the Lane colored boy and
Sammy Lucky, another colored boy,
get rid of It. At one time they bad
disposed of two gallons of whiskey
and at another time nineteen quart
Itottles of beer. Lucky is now lock
ed - up pending the disposition of
these charges.
Washington appealed for sytnpa
thy in his behalf, in order that he
"might straighten up and rare for
his wife and baby." This appeal fell
on deaf ears, however, when the fol
lowing letter, written to him by 11
quarter-breed Indian girl, named Mi-
netta Nelson, who formerly worked
in the lion-Ton cafe In Alliance, and
who Is now In Rapid City, S. I)., was
found. The letter read as follows:
