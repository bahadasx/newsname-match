LONG DROUGHT IS BROKEN
BY BIG SOAKING RAINS
Will be Worth Half Million Dollars to Curry County.
Means Another Year of Prosperity.
Who said Clovia was a dry
town? Those who saw the
rivers of water racing through
the streets Sunday night, and
the ponda standing in vacant
lots could imagine they were in
the City of Venice just as easily
as in Clovis, New Mexico. To
a newcomer who thought it
couldn't rain in this country it
was a revelation.
The worst drouth that has pre
vailed in Eastern New Mexico
in many years was effectively
broken by a six days soaking
rain. The rain was general
throughout the plains country.
It started to rain on Thursday
and kept it up until Tuesday
morning. The wind blew a gale
and it rained all Saturday night.
Sunday and Monday night there
wns another downpour.
According to the local weather
bureau there was 7:03 inches of
rainfall during the six days
diHtributed as follows: Thursday
,H3 inches, Friday .30 inched,
Saturday 3:00 inches, Sunday
HO inches, Monday 1:90 inches,
and Tuesday :20 inches. This
makes a total of 7:03 inches of
rainfall in six. days.
The rain came just in the nick
of time to save the row crops,
but it came nevertheless, and
will insure plenty of feed for the
wiater months. The farmers
and stockmen are happy, for it
means good grass on the range
which will fatten the cattle be
fore winter sets in.
The moisture in the ground
will be worth half a million dol
lars or more, to Curry County.
It is almost inestimable. There
is an excellent season in the
ground for wheat planting,
and with the acreage nearly
double that of last year, it is
easy to see what it means to the
people of the county.
This is the first good soakin g
rain since last April, and it was
a welcome one. The farmers
and stock growers are jubilant
and the people are in high spirits.
It means an other year of prosper
ity to Cbvis and Curry County.
From the weather bureau re
ports, the big rain storms that
swept Curry County first of the
week were caused by the tropic
al hurricane that struck Corpus
Christi and Brownsville, Texas,
Friday night. After striking
the Texas coast the great storm
curved to the Northwest and
spent its force over the plains of
Eastern New Mexico.
LARGEST CIRCULATION OF ANY
PAPER IN EASTERN NEW MEXICO
And Only Three Cities in Entire State Have Papers
That Surpass It.
The worn bona-fide circula
tion of the Cloria News is 1,716.
It is with considerable degree
of pride that the News makes
this announcement. Pardon us
if we blow our horn a little, as
the old adage goes: "He that
tooteth not his own horn, the
same shall not be tooted." We
believe that advertisers and the
people of Clovis and Curry coun
ty have a right to know just
what the circulation of the
News is.
The first question prospective
advertisers ask of a newspaper
is "What's your circulation""
It is only right and proper that
they Bhould know. The day of
buying a "pig in a poke" is
over. A newspaper's stock in
trade is its advertising space,
and the advertising public is en
titled to know just what they
are getting for their money.
The News is the oldest paper
in Clovis, hiving been estab
lished in 1906 when the town
was started. It is now in its
tenth year and has constantly
forged ahead until it has the
largest circulation of any paper
in Eastern New Mexico.
A circulation of 1.716 copies
in a new town and a new coun
try is a big list
According to Lord and Thom
as' newspaper directory of 1916,
published in Chicag), which is
considered eminent authority,
there are but three cities in the
state that have newspapers with
circulations larger than the Clo
vis News. They are Albuquer
que, Las Vegas and Santa Fe.
It may be interesting to the
people of Ciovis to know that
its home paper, the Clovis News
has the largest circulation of
any newspaper in the state out
side of these three cities.
The sworn statement of the
bona-fide circulation of the News
is given below. Read it.
PAND0LF0 BOUND OVER
TO THE GRAND JURY
Later All Parties Concerned Agree on Settlement
and Matter Will Be Dropped.
The case of S. C. Pandolfo, or
gamzer of the Pan Motor Car
Company, came up for hearing
in Clovis Tuesday afternoon be
fore Justice Noble. Pandolfo
was charred with making
damaging statements concerning
the Clovis National Bank and
some of its officials.
The action grew out of the
memoriable gathering held in
this city on the night of July 19
at the Elks auditorium, when
considerable charges and accu
sations were indulged in by
prominent citizens of Clovis and
Promotor Pandolfo.
At the preliminary hearing
Pandolfo was bound over to the
grand jury under a bond of $500,
which was furnished. The
grand jury convenes the fourth
Monday in September.
A large crowd was present at
the preliminary hearing which
offered considerable merriment
te the spectators, who were
called down once by the court
for laughter. Mr. Pandolfo was
present attired in a palm beach
suit and a radiant smile, and
was in close consultation with
his attorney W. A. Gillenwater
during the proceedings, Attor
ney A. W. Hockenhull repre
sented the plaintiff.
AGREED ON SETTLEMENT
Tuesday evening after the pre
liminary hearing of Pandolfo, a
meeting was held by all parties
concerned and it was agreed that
the suits filed by both sides be
dropped. Aa a resilt the two
suits filed in the district court
by Pandolfo against the Clovis
National Bank and Alex Shipley,
its president, and the one against
the Clovis Journal will be dis
missed. Likewise the suit filed
against S. C. Pandolfo will be
dismissed. All parties concern
ed have agreed to terminate
legal procedure at its present
stage of development

CLOVIS' NEW WELL COULD
WATER A CITY OF 20,000
Will Save the City $2,000 a Year in Fuel, Up keep
and Labor. Well About Completed.
Nebraska Man Seeks
Information About Clevis
The News has received the
following letter from E. E.
Tingley one of its subscribers at
Shelton, Nebraska:
"Will you please inform me
through the columns of your
paper what the population of
Clevis is, and what is its alti
tude. What is the average year
ly rainfall, and what months
have the heaviest precipitation?
What is the average yearly tem
perature, and the extreme heat
and cold?"
Clovis has a population of
5,000, and its altitude is 4,200
feet above sea level. The aver
age yearly rainfall is 22 inches,
this has been the average for
the past ten years. Good rains
are look for in July and August
and in the winter months, This
summer has been an exception
however in regard to rainfall.
Very little rain fell in July, but
August is showing up better.
An inch rainfall was recorded
in Clovis last Thursday nieht.
This has been the dryest year in
ten years, although there was a
good wheat crop which made
from 10 to 80 bushels per acre,
and the row crops will make
plenty of feed far the winter.
From best reports the average
yearly temperature is about GO
degrees. The hottest weather is
from 98 to 100 degrees, which
is unusual, and the eoldest is
around zero, which is very rare,
With our high elevation we en
joy the best of climate, it being
neither of the extremes, too hot
or too cold. This is the finest
climate in the world.
J. G. Gritlith, a farmer resid
ing neat Hollene. was a recent
caller at the News office. Mr.
Griffith has lived in Curry county
during the vast ten years having
come her-' from Illinois. He
saya this is the best) country in
the worli -ind only regrets that
he did not come here sooner.
Mr. Griffith makes Clovia hia
trading point, although it is 34
miles from his home.
Work is progressing rapidly
on the new well being bored by
the city for the water works
system, and it will soon be com
pleted. The well is said to be the larg
est one ever drilled in the Unit
ed States with a rotary machine.
The total depth is 515 feet. The
first 245 feet is cased with a 36
inch pipe placed in a 40 inch
hole. The next 110 feet -has a
14 inch casitig, and an 8 Inch pipe
goes the rest of the way, which
is 160 feet.
The main shaft will have an
elevator just like a large office
building with capacity for one
passenger. The well is now
completed with the exception of
the larpe room whieh is now
being dug out at a depth of 225
feet. This room will be 15 to 20
feet square and will be lined
with concrete. From this cavity
the water will be pumped to the
surface by a large centrifugal
pump.
Few people realixe the impor
tance of this great well. It is
attracting more attention appar
ently outside of Clovis than it is
in the city. Albuquerque par
ties are watching it with a view
of drilling one there. Amarillo
has already sent some city offi
cials to investigate it and the
Santa Fe railroad may put one
down.
Credit for this big enterprise
is due G. W. Chalfant, Superin
tendent of Pablic Works. He
has worked long and faithful for
its success. He knows what a
hard job it is to keep the ma
chinery in running order on the
five small wells which now sup
sly the city with water. The
new well will have a norma) ca
pacity of pumping 400,000 gal
lons a day, which can be in
creased to a million gallons a
day if the occasion demands it.
The new well will save the city
$2,000 a year in fuel, upkeep
and labor. The old wells Will
be held in reserve but will
not be used after the completion
of the big one.
Mr. Chalfant saya ia making
the big well, the city ia building
for the future. He thinks it
will have a capacity large enough
to furnish water to a city of
15,000 to 20,000 inhabitants.
John Luikart at Home
Lieutenant John Luikart of
Company "K" spent the week
in Clovis among friends and rel
atives, and was glad to get back
home for a few daya. He re
ports the Clovia boys on the
border getting along nicely, and
are always anxious to hear from
home.
Lieutenant Luikart is in sym-
patny witn the movement to
raise a mesa fund for the boya
at the front. He says that the
boys have plenty of plain food,
but have no little delicacies
which they are accustomed to at
home and that chicken would be
considered a luxury. Far this
reason he thinks the mess fund
is a worthy movement, and one
that would be highly appreciated
by all the boya in Company "K."
Other towns and cities all over
the country are raising mesa
funds for the boys from home
and many towns smaller than
Clovis have made niee contributions.
Miss Thyrza Johnson of
Roosevelt county, among hun
dreds of teachers examined thia
summer at Santa Fe made a
grade of 100. per oent. Only one
other made this record. Miss
Johnson spelled fifty words cor
rectly, placed the correct dia
critical marks for all the vowels
and consonants, marked and ac
cented a group of seven words,
and gave two rulea that are use
ful in spelling.
