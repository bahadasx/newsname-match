ADMITS HE LURED
3000 YOUNG GIRLS
TO VICE RESORTS
New York Man Says Victims
Came Mostly Fran Poor
Families
Using well dressed young men as
his agents, Yuse Botwin, confessed
"king of the New York white slave
trust," lured 3,000 school trills from
their homes into dens of vice in 10
years, he told Asst. Dist. Attorney
Smith, who made the confession pub
lic recently.
Many of his victims were only Hi
years old, Botwin said. They came
generally from poor families.
Started With Candy
Hot win's agents loitered around
schoolhouscs and flirted. Then came
gifts of candy, auto rides and finally
a trip to a Broadway resort, winding
up with a night in a hotel. Then the
girls were induced to write notes to
their mothers, saying they had eloped.
They were then taken to a nearby
city, kept there a few weeks, then
brought back to New York and placed
in disorderly houses.
"But didn't they ever try to run
away and go back to their homos?"
asked the attorney.
Botwin Pleads Guilty
"Older girls might have done that,
but the ones we handled never went
back home after we gave them their
start," said Botwin. "That's why we
picked school girls."
Botwin pleaded guilty to one of five
indictments'found against him in the
investigation of the "vice trust." His
revelations are expected to result in
the filing of charges against more
policemen.
KNOWN BY THE
COMPANY HE KEPT
Mr. Hughes, the G. O. P. candidate
for president, was a visitor in Detroit
recently. His coming was heralded
by the capitalist papers, who are al
ways opposed to the interests of the
workers. He was "received," enter
tained, "wined and dined", by the cap
italists, bank owners, factory owners,
members of the* Board of Commerce
and Employers' Associationall of
the eminently respectable citizens.
MEYER LONDON
SHOWS UP FAKE
Learns Rock Island Road Gets
Forced "Petitions" From
Employes
Evidence that some of the big rail
roads now defying the brotherhoods
in the latter's demand for the eight
hour day are forcing their unskilled
and their unorganized employes to
"petition" President Wilson to inter
vent and save the day for the com
panies, has reached the office of So
cialist Representative Meyer London.
It appears that the Rock Island
lines have begun collecting these "pe
titions" from Mexican section hands
who understand no word of English
and from all other employes outside
the train crews. The implied threat
of punishment for refusal to sign this
appeal has been effective. Within a
day or two, if the scheme is consum
mated, the white house and congress
will begin to hear of this "petition"
from the employes of the railroads
who are employed on the trains.

KELLY AND MCRAE DEFEND STRIKE
BREAKERS AND GUNMEN IN EVERETT
City and County Police Force Used to Help Beat
Up Striking Shingleweavers and Give
Gunmen Plenty of Freedom
Ones again King Kelly has demon-!
i
stinted the fact to the citizens of Ev
erett that he is the High Mogul in ;
this neck of the woods. The "King" j
is spending more than a thousand dol-'
lars a month of Everett taxpayers'
money in order to keep "specials" to
protect the interests of the mill own
ers. This fact wits demonstrated
when some 75 strike breakers attack* '
i'd the picket line of 11) union shingle
weavers at the Cargo mill last Satur
day morning and the police stood by ,
and laughed and seemed tickled to |
death to see the pickets get a licking.
We were always under the impres
sion that the police force were to be
used for the keeping of law and order
but we are fully convinced now, that
the police force, in Everett anyhow,
is for the protection of capitalist
property, human or concrete. The
human property (scabs) on that
memorable morning needed no protec
tion as they were 4 to 1, but in the
evening when some 160 unionists and
sympathizers were on hand to give
the scabs a drubbing the police butted
in with their guns and protected the
■cabs and gunmen.
If there ever was a tool of the cap
italists, Kelly is that one. His utter
contempt for a man in overalls, the
men that elected him, has been shown
on dozens of occasions and the older
he gets the worse he seems to get.
In the council chamber the other day
he stated that he was not going to
let "roughnecks run the city" and yet
at the same time he is giving the free
dom of the city to imported gunmen,
who are being paid $40 a week to be
ready to start trouble. These men,
and there were four of them here last
Saturday, are being paid by Jamieson
and it was one of these that told the
scabs, while at breakfast that, morn
ing, that they were going to clean up
the picket line. One man, the night
watchman, at once said that he wasn't
hired to do any fighting find quit on
the spot. But this did not deter the
gunmen and the scabs from sallying
forth to "clean up the picket line."
It apparently had been all arranged
for no sooner had Jamieson's scabs
appeared on the scene than the scabs
from the C. B. mill appeared behind
the pickets and thus the pickets were
hemmed in between two lines of scabs.
And then the battle began. With a
cry of "Get Mills! Get Bogan! Get
Barrett!" they rushed onto that little
band of pickets and kicked and punch
ed and clubbed until the pickets were
forced to run. And the police stood
by and laughed and sneered. And the
gunmen got union officials, Mills, Bo
gan and Barrett.
The capitalist press of the city is
putting a different aspect on this case
by making the citizens believe that
the pickets started the fray. In do
ing this they make a good case for
the indorsement of the "anti-picket
ing" bill that is to be referred to the
voters this fall. It makes a good case
for the plutocratic capitalists, and as
it is the policy of the capitalist press
to take the side of big business, it
isn't at all out of place for the press
to make the case against labor as
black as possible.,
The shingle weavers were winning.
Every man on the picket line has been
CAMPAIGN FUND $8,000
In spite of the hot and distressing
weather the Socialists of America are
rolling up a big campaign fund. Al
though the appeal for funds has been
out only a few weeks a total of over
$8,000 has been collected on the var
ious funds for campaign purposes, in
cluding the $1,890 which has been
paid in by the locals on the dates for
the presidential and vice presidential
[candidates' tours.
In the Second Congressional Dis
trict of Washington the campaign
fund is coming in pretty liberally.
The committee expects to spend some
$300.00 and most of this will be ob
tainable.
In other sections of Washington the
funds are coming in kind of slow but
we hope to see quite an improvement
once we launch our campaign.
The campaign will be launched on
Sept. 3 which is the first day of RED
WEEK.
John D. Rockefeller is gathering in

EVERETT, WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, AUGUST 24, 1916
receiving $3.00 per day from the
fund of about $800 that is being sup
plied by the shthgleweavers that are
working in other districts. Every
striker was getting his pay in one
form or another and the union had
made up its mind to keep that picket
line there, be it one month or one year,
Hence the bosses were getting scared
and finally made up their minds to
do something. That something was
done Saturday morning and now the
mill owners have discovered that they
have hit a hornet's nest.
Organized labor of. Everett have
got solidly behind the strikers and it
is going to be a fight that the Union
haters will long remember. All the
so-called friends of labor have stood
by the bosses during the last scrap.
Sheriff Mcßae, an ex-union shingle
weaver, has turned out to be a rene
gade and the $25 that he donated to
the strike fund at the beginning of
the trouble has been returned to him.
At a special meeting called by the
Trades Council Monday night the fol
lowing resolutions were adopted as a
result of the arresting of ten men
who had been given orders to leave
town but had refused, and as a conse
quence got jugged. These men, ex
cepting one, have since been released.
The police of this city and the coun
; ty sheriff have taken the side of the
bosses against labor and it is going
to be a fight to a finish. Comrade
B. A. Burton, the Socialist candidate
for Sheriff, will get a bigger boost by
organized labor this fall than organ
ized labor has given any man in the
city of Everett before. The sentiment
is ripe for a Socialist administration
in both the city and the county and
the present strife will help to weld the
ranks of Socialists and Unionists to
gether as nothing else ever could.
I .That organized labor has seen, the
light could easily be discerned at the
special meeting and by the following
resolutions, and we hope that the rest
of the citizens of Snohomish county
will put a stop to the autocratic acts
of county officials by electing a full
Socialist ticket this fall.
"To the General Public of Everett:
"Whereas, the organized workers
are being discriminated against by the
authorities of the city of Everett and
the sheriff's office of Snohomish
county( by openly winking at violence
on the part of imported strikebreak
ers and professional thugs, but deny
the striking workmen the same pro
tection afforded the strikebreakers,
and
• "Whereas, organized labor only de
sires to exercise our constitutional
rights and be accorded the protection
that the law allows, therefore be it
"Resolved, that we inform the of
ficials of Everett, Snohomish county
and the state of Washington that we
insist on our constitutional rights;
and be it further
"Resolved, that we condemn the
actions of the Everett police depart
ment and the sheriff's office of Sno
homish county for imprisoning union
men for simply refusing to leave the
city; be it further
"Resolved, that organized labor
call a mass meeting at the City park
Thursday, August 24, to enlighten
the general public as to the real con
ditions that exist on the waterfront."

A loan of $100,000,000 has just been
negotiated for the French Republic
by Messrs. J. P. Morgan & Co. At the
opening of the war this thing was im

neutrality, and it will be remembered
that President Wilson so informed
Morgan, and Morgan agreed with him
at the time But since then morality
and neutrality have both undergone
a lightning change.

TENDENCIES
OF CAPITALISM
Every census report is a Socialist
argument. The department of com
merce has issued a bulletin on manu
factures in the United States that
once more proves every claim set
forth by Socialists as to industrial
...
evolution.
The number of "proprietors and
firm members" has decreased 3.1 per
cent between 1909 and 1914. But the
number of wage earners has increased
6.4 per cent. Today there are 264,872
owners confronting 7,036,337 workers
in the manufacturing industry of the
United States.
There is small comfort for the little
capitalist in these figures. The num
ber of establishments grew but 2.7 per
cent, while the capital invested went
up eleven times as fast, or 23.7 per
cent.
Bigger firms, fewer owners, more
wage-workers— is the story of
five years' growth in manufacturing.
VALUE OF ORGANIZATION
What of the Homeless Girl Who Com
petes With "Pin Money" Workers?
"A girl earning $5 a week in a
Springfield department store shortly
before the survey, asked for a wage
increase. She was told that if she
wasn't satisfied she could go else
where. To the store her loss was of
small consequence. Another girl will
ing to ,work for $5 would take her
place, and work in the store would
move along as it had before. But to
the girl the alternative was serious.
It meant continuation at less than a
living wage, or possible temporary
unemployment while seeking another
place. Workingmen, moreover, with
families to support, when placed in
similar situations, hesitate a good
deal before giving up employment,
and many stay at a wage below what
they think they deserve, rather than
venture on the uncertain hope of se
curing higher wages.
"The case of the girl illustrates the
general truth, that acting alone em
ployees are practically powerless to
win wage concessions, shorter hours,
or better work conditions, for they
have no means for enforcing their de
mands. Experience has shown that it
is only by acting together that they
can force hours down and wages up,
or bring about other improvements.
The labor union movement, therefore,
offers an effective means by which
employees may do something worth
while toward industrial betterment."

OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY TH* SOCIALIST PARTY OF SNOHOMISH COUNTY
ENGLAND WILL WAR ON THE U. S.
IF BIG NAVY PROGRAM IS CARRIED OUT
Allan L. Benson Quotes British Authority for the
Prediction and Declares Greater Armament
Folly in View of Europe's Example
Allan. L. Benson takes issue with
the New/York World's argument for
preparedness. The World, says Ben
son, justifies the enormous. military
expenditures of the United States on
the ground that they will be a pro
tection against an- invasion by Ger
many. But, in fact, if the United
States carry put their big navy pro
gram, England will declare war on
this country within five years.
"In this connection," continues Ben
son, "it is interesting to consider that
G. Lowes Dickinson, an English pub
licist of international reputation, has
publicly expressed the belief that if
the United States should embark up
on a huge naval program that Great
Britain, within five years, would pro
voke a quarrel with us and force war.
People Should Reflect
These matters are not always clear
to men and women who work hard all
day and have little time to consider
public questions. They are very clear
to those who have time to think. The
truth is that the great capitalists who
are pushing these appropriation bills
are not at all afraid of Germany.
They want a great navy because they
want sea-power with which to get and
hold foreign trade. They believe that
while Europe is fighting the time is
favorable to pick up trade concessions,
monopolies and other things of value.
As it happens, the capitalists of
Great Britain have long been engaged
in the same business. They want for
eign trade and foreign concessions.
These British gentlemen never had
anything against Germany until the
Germans began to rival them in for
eign trade and prospective sea-power.
As Germany grew great in trade and
in warships, British hatred increased.
jl. England Will Fight jn^A*?
Dickinson, the English publicist,
has ample justification for the belief
that if we should begin to threaten
English trade and English naval su
premacy, that we should soon find
ourselves at war with England. He
knows the English government, as he
also knows the , capitalist class of
England. What he sees coming above
the horizon, we may see at our doors
within a few years.
The easy way to dispose of such
matters is to pay no attention to
them. That is the way human beings
usually do while wars are in the pro
cess of formation. That is the way
the peoples of Europe did. Year after
year, European Socialists sounded
warnings. Many heeded the warning.
The Socialist party became power
ful enough in many nations. But the
Socialist party did not become power
ful enough in any nation to control
its policy. Capitalists continued to
control the policy of each nation. The
capitalist group of each nation went
diligently about it to get more foreign
trade. Each nation kept piling sol
diers and warships upon the backs of
the workers. The trade did not bring
happiness and the battleships did not
prevent war.
Calls Preparedness Blunder
We are asked to commit the same
colossal follies. Wilson asks you to
commit them. Hughes asks you to
commit them. We Socialists urge
RURAL CREDITS FAKE
The Bankers Life Insurance Co. is
now offering money on farm mort
gages at six per cent and "no strings
to it or extras." The Donk rural
credit fake where you can not borrow
more than 50 per cent of the property
security and that must be more than
a homestead, where you must unwind
a thousand miles of red tape to get
the money and pay at least 6 per cent
interest, is thereby made to look sick.
Let the people own the banking and
credit monopoly and then we shall
have rural credits with the bells on.
The party of the usurers and land
lords do not want that kind of rural
credits, but the party of the working
class does.—The Rebel.

As the World/says, the military

other nation ever .considered in time

asked to spend in one year the enor

before the war broke out, Great Brit
ain spent but $260,000,000 and Ger
many but $114,000,000.
Germany No Danger
We are asked by ■Wilson to spend
$315,000,000 and Hughes blames Wil
son because he does not urge that we
spend more! We are asked to spend
more than the entire receipts of the
government for any • year prior to
1911. We are asked to spend a sum
in excess of two-thirds of the value
of our wheat crop. ' -
For what? To whip Germany if
she comes over here, to ."invade" us!
To whip the nation that has already
had more than half of its men put out
of action on the battlefield and is still
at war! To whip a nation that, as
a result of this war, will ' for years
and years be a cripple! * ';■
Indeed, if our capitalists, who are
back of these military bills, were to
be believed, they would be a brave
lot! But they are not to be believed.
They are not afraid of : Germany.
They are in search, of trade, conces
sions, monopolies, They want
naval power to bring home the booty.
They want land forces to i put down
strikes here at home {whenever work
ingmen are made disorderly by high
wages that are not quite high enough
to reach the cost of living.
Hughes made one of _ the . longest
speeches of acceptance that any pres
idential candidate ever employed .in
annexing a nominationbut ■he had
nothing <■ to ~> say dj-irt„*__. matters.
Equally silent is Wilson: Both of
these gentlemen talk much and loud
ly of Mexican affairs that are past
and other relatively unimportant
things.
Statesmen Are Silent
Why are these gentlemen silent?
Why do they not explain why we
should so fear a nation that is being
shot to pieces?
Make no mistake—this country is
confronted with militarism! Soft
names do not alter hard facts. It is
not "preparedness" that we are con
sideringit is militarism.
If the fight against militarism be
lost this year, it will probably be lost
forever. If we spend two-thirds of
the value of our wheat crop this year,
Great Britain will scent danger, and
next year we shall be asked to spend
a sum equal to the value of our en
tire wheat crop.
We shall be told that Great Britain
is acting strangely and that we must
have a navy large enough to deal
with her.
Put a soldier or a sailor upon the
back of every American and life here
will never again be what it has been.
As compared with some other coun
tries, America has always been a
pretty decent place in which to live.
Foreigners who have been used to
carrying soldiers upon their backs
have come here because America was
better than their old countries.

BLACKLIST MADE
WITH APPROVAL
OF U.S. BANKERS
Statement Declares America
Will Profit by Boycott of
Some Firms

*■'■ ' "*:i»-' ' - * "■ **' ' ■ ■'
That the flSfitish blacklist of Amer- '
ican firms was not published until the
approval of. several large banking in
stitutions of New York had first been
assured, has been said on good auth
ority * ' .<<%,>'■
When the question of the effect of
the blacklist on South American trade
was reached, the j banks referred to
were convinced that the United States
would profit by the boycott. Many
of the blacklisted firms, the British
officials point out, have been main
taining Germany's trade relations
with South America and were in a
position to do so only because they
were domiciled in a neutral country.
With the boycott in force, it is said,
practically the only competition
against American business would be
removed, and the business outlook for
those banks which recently establish
ed branches in South America would
be materially brightened. There
would be no diminution in American
trade, but only a transfer of business
of foreign firms from the boycotted
houses to others, it is pointed out.
This may result in strong pressure on
the government by powerful financial
interests which will benefit by the
blacklist, to prevent any action
against England.
