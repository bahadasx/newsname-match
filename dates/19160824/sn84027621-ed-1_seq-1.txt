Allied Offensive in the Balkans Stead
ily Develops Strength as the
Days Go On
(Associated Press)
London, Aug. 22 Today's advices
show that an Allied offensive in the
Balkans is developing. France reports
the Serbians advancing, they having
captured a hill near Ostrovo lake and
that attacks against the Allied center
were easily repulsed. No infantry ad
vance is reported in this section, but
artillery is notably active. The Bul
garian advance on the - Allies' right
flank is apparently continuing as Bul
garian announces a defeat for the Al
lies along the Struma , river, killing
more than four hundred and captur
ing a quantity of material.
RUSSIANS
AND TURKS
CLAIMS
MAKE
Turkey reports considerable Rus
sian pressure in southern Turkish Ar
menia, but asserts the Russians were
repulsed, losing three . thousand men
in one sector. Russia announces the
capture of two Turkish regiments in
this section.
AUSTRIANS CHECK RUSSIANS
Sharp fighting continues in the
Carpathians, with Austria claiming
the Russians were repulsed at Jab-
onitza pass.
FIGHTING SLACK ON SOMME
FRONT
Activity on the Somme front has
slackened visibly except for German
attacks against the British near Guil-
emont and the French south of the
Somme. Artillery fire on both sides
is vigorous.
NAVAL WAR ;

nies this.
BATTLE IS UNBROKEN
Petrograd, Aug.! 24. The feature
of the Russian" campaign, which be
gan like a tempest on the southwest
ern front more than two and a half
months ago, is the almost continuous
nature of the fighting. With the ex
ception of brief interludes for consol
idating positions or changing the
direction of attack, it has been like
one great sustained battle. Periods
ike the present, which are described
as "lulls," usually turn out to have
been crowded with intense fighting,
the details of which it has been the
consistent policy of the Russian staff
to hold secret until the operations are
ended. ' ' ' ' ' ' '.. .. '

Washington, Aug. 24. There was
renewed optimism today among the

the White House over the prospects
for averting the threatened railroad
strike, and the signs of unrest among
the men were not so apparent today.
GETTING TOGETHER
After continued conferences be
tween President Wilson and eight rail
road committeemen, the situation is
described as . having narrowed down
to the concrete result " that the rail
roads' committee is willing to accept
an eight-hour day, but in return will
ask the assurance of getting increased
freight rates and that Congress will
create a permanent commission to in
vestigate future labor differences and
make public its report before a strike
vote is taken. The proposals were
communicated to brotherhood leaders,
who seemed to regard them favorably.

FLORIDA VERSUS THE WEST
(Contributed)
Editor Star: A correspondent to
one of the Jacksonville papers, lately,
asked: "Why are there not more
farms and farmers in Duval county,
with so much uncultivated land, that
could .and should produce the things
that are being shipped into Jackson
ville from states further north?"
The same conditions are in Marion
county. Why were the Dakotas, Ne
braska, western Iowa and other states
that have notably long and hard win
ters so quickly settled, and Florida
with her superb climate, and farming
land going a begging? True, Florida
sod is inferior, but it easily produces
two crops a year.
i
When Mr.' A
settled in western
Iowa in ; 1880, he could buy land for
$1.25 to $12 per acre, depending upon
the location, distance from railroad,
etc. The same farms today sell for
$100 and $250 per acre. Mr. A
paid $8 per acre for. 160 acres, pay
ing one-fourth cash, balance on time.
His wealth consisted of a good team,
etc., and seed to plant. The first sea
son he lived in a tent. He began
plowing immediately. His - first crop
was flax, which he continued planting
until it was too late to plant. Then
he struck out to earn some money
with his team and never saw his crdp
until it was time to harvest. His
crop was not fenced,, either were any
of his neighbors' crops.
Many of his neighbors had cattle,
but only - the milk cows were home,
and those were picketed out by ropes.
The others were in the neighborhood
herd, which consisted of several hun
dred head, in care of a couple of
young herdsmen who, when crops
were harvested, brought them in,
sleek and fat, receiving from tha
owners pay for care of some. ;
By the time Mr. A- - had made
his last payment, his land had earned
enough for improvement. He could
ride for miles with corn ,and small
grains on each side of the road. When
he came to a, fenced track, the fence
had been made by the owner to keep
his stock in, not to keep some other
man's stock out. And the stock was
good. It never pays to build any
fence for scrubs anywhere. Condi
tions there were good for the man
with small means to get ahead and
he advised his friends to come and do
likewise; and they came.
Now, when Mr. New Settler comes
to Florida, he canVbuy land as cheap
as he can anywhere but, as the soil
is not as prolific, he will need more
acres of land for his farm. He . has
no stock, but before he can sow a
seed he must build a very good fence,
which may possibly cost as much or
more than the land. After planting, he
must stay and watch it day and night
for fear Mr. Hogman's $2 razorback
will climb over, if he cannot root un
der, and ruin the crop. Along about
February or March he must be vig
ilant, for Mr. Cowman, who has some
walking skeletons that must have
something to sustain life, fires the
range, thereby destroying what na
ture has provided to enrich the soil,
so that his cattle may get a little new
growth wire grass. Mr. Settler is
fortunate if - he does rot have to do
more than rebuild half of his fence.
He wonders if it is true, when Mr.
Cowman tells him the law allows him
to fire most anything he waits to in
February and March. After becom
ing acquainted with Mr. Cowman and
Mr. Hogman, he learns that they are
pretty, good fellows just victims cf
circumstances,. Mr. Hogman does not
belong to the kind he has heard of,
who, when he goes out to round up a
hog, brings one, even if he has to
bring It with both ears cut off. He
would like to rid his stock of ticks
But what's the use? For every head
inside the fence, there are ten out
side, seeding his pasture with ticks
So, when Mr. Settler's friends write
and ask him how he likes Florida and
would he advise them to come, he an
swers by telling of the ideal climate,
sandy beaches and gems of lakes. He
also says, that if conditions were only
different so that the man of small
means, the future permanent resi
dent, able and willing to work, after
digging and scratching could get a
foothold to climb, inside of ten years,
every section of land in Marion coun-

Mr. N. W. Harrison has bought an
additional 75 acres and -added it to

run3 down to Bower lake and includes
some very rich muck land, which he
is fencing and clearing for spring
crops. He is starting a blooded pig
farm on the old Comstock place, which
he purchased sometime ago. He will
keep only fine stock in encolsures and
raise all the forage right on the farm
where he has demonstrated this sea
son and made a great success of corn,
peanuts, dasheens and chuffas. He has

four three room cottages for his farm

splendid courage in the past year or

Jacksonville, at a cost of between
twenty and twenty-five thou sand dol
lars, complete from garret to cellar
in every detail. The house rests on
a solid concrete foundation with a
basement fifty by one hundred feet
under the entire house. The walls are
of four thicknesses with a stucco out
side finish. Tile and hardwood floors,
with three bath rooms, water all
through the house and grounds, wired
for electric lights as is also the dock
and garage. Mr. Harrison sees no
reason to doubt if we have better and
more attractive homes on the lake

MARION COUNTY MILK
In DemandoSupply Ice Cream Fac
tory of Jacksonville
The Purity Ice Cream and Dairy
company of Jacksonville is making an
investigation to ascertain what quan
tity of milk can be obtained in Mar
ion county. The company is in the
market for 4,000 gallons of whole
milk a day, and is making a survey of
the state to find out what quantity is,
or will be available. If the supply of
milk to be obtained warrants it, spe
cial milk cars will be put ' in service
to transport the milk to Jacksonville.
Mr. Bernard Thyson, manager of
the Purity Ice Cream and Dairy com
pany, Dr. L. R. Lang, manufacturing
and extension expert ol the company,
and Mr. A. P. Fant, assistant indus
trial agent of the Seaboard Air Line,
are here today to find out what pos
sibilities Marion county holds out to
them in the way of milk supply. The
representatives of the Purity com
pany are this afternoon conferring
with ' Mr. Z. C. Chambliss. L. R.
Trammell, secretary of the board of
trade, will also assist the visitors in
any way he can. .'
Dr. Lang, formerly with the Uni
versity of Illinois, will have charge
of developing the field of supply fot
the Jacksonville company. If the out
look in this county appears favorable,
he will return to Ocala in a few days
and get in direct touch with the farm
ers and dairymen.
The Purity company is now getting
most of its milk in the territory be
tween Jacksonville and Tallahassee,
and it is being taken into Jacksonville
in ; refrigerator cans in the baggage
cars. The Seaboard is having a milk
car constructed for that territory,
hewever, and it will shortly be placed
in service.
Mr. Thyson said today that his
company was thinking of starting a
milk car down about Dade City, and
running it through to Jacksonville,
picking up milk en route. Whether or
not this plan will be carried out de
pends on the investigations to be
made by Dr. Lang. If as much as 500
gallons of whole milk, with four per
cent butter 'fat, can be obtained to
start with Mr. Thyson believes that a
car can be placed in service.
