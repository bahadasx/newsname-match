4663 MILES BY AUTOMOBILE
The Herald editor in company with
MIm Virginia Wlckham, Air. and Mrs.
W. II. Thomas and Mr. and Mm. Frank
I.aughrin returned Wednesday of lait
week from our overland trip by auto
mobile, to the Pacific conn. The trip
was made In two llulck Sixes, covered
a period of nine weeks and a distance
of 4C03 miles was traveled Not ono
cent was (pent for repairs on elfiier
of the machines during the entire trip
and we traveled from Heaver to tho
I'acirio ocean without a punctured tire
or a blowout, On the return trip how
ever, wo were not so fortunate for our
casings had become worn from the trip
over the rocky mountain roaue and wo
had scarcely turned our faces home
ward until we began to experience
some of the real Joys (?) of motoring
The second day out the casings on Mr.
Lnughriu's car, which had been run
more than a 1000 miles before We left
Beaver, went to the bad and we had
blow-outs fast and furiously for a little
wlille. Fortunately, we were not far
from liars tow, California, and when
we reached that place the casings were
discarded and aside from one blow-out
on the writer's machine and a few
punctures, our tire troubles were
ended Summing it all up whenwe
reached home the extent of our tire
trouble for tlie,entire 4003 miles wore
a lull set ut casings on each machine
practically ready for the junk pile and
a dozen vulcanlzings of inner tubes.
It strikes us that, that Is an exceeding
good record, considering the mountain
roads we traveled.
The experiences of our trip, tho
many beautiful things we saw and the
points or Interest visited, would re
quire a long tale to relate. We should
like to give our readers a detailed ao
count of it ull but we realized when
we started out that to attempt to do
this would mean to take our work
right along with us and no vacation at
ail, so we decided to see all we could
see and enjoy everything in sight and
forget that we even owned a newspa
per. We will not try to give our
readers a descriptive article nor at
tempt to tell jou all we saw. To do
justice to such an article would re
quire a full page of the Herald. We
will Jiowever, give a brief outline of
our tour.
Leaving Reaver, June 7th, aftor
waiting several day for the roads to
become passable after the big rain
which fell about that time, we had
scarcely gotten outside the city limits
until we fouud that we had not waited
long enough The roads were a fright,
We made Boise City the first day (and
night) ml wo had grief all the way.
First one car would etick in the mud
and then the other but we managed to
keep one in the clear most of tho time
and with tho help of a good stout rope
we lloundered our way through. Onco
both machines became hopelessly
grounded and we weru forced to call
on a passing team to help ua out.
This was the only instance on the en
tire trip that we were not able to pro
ceed with our own power. After leav
ing ltolse we had no further-mud to
contend with until we started en the
homeward journey. Coming back we
had ralu every day except two and the
roods becajne pretty slippery and
muddy at times but we were fortunate
in that tho heaviest rains seemed to
follow us and while we did not make
as good time as we would otherwise
have made, yet, we were not luid up
on account of rain and came through
without sticking,
Tho country traversed until we wont
down over the mountains Into verdant
Southern California was very much
the same. It was all practically a
desert. Some was just a little more
"deserter" than the other. Of course,
here and there, there were stretches
of low mountain ranges with green
valleys lying between and covered
with a growth of cedar and pine but
these were few and far between. For
the most part New Mexico and Arizona
were a barren prairie without evidence
of enough grass to keep a jack rabbit
alive, yet we saw thousands of head of
sheep. What they grazed upon was
more than we knew. In the more bar
ren sections, herds of goats were seen.
They muit have lived oo the rocks for
there was nothing else In evidence.
The only habitations were the sheep
herders tents pitched on the hills and
a few Indian villages. The Indians of
that section are principally Navajos
and Hopis, They live in pueblos,
made of adobe with mud root and lo
cated In villages, They are scarcely
ever found living in any other war.
They are more agriculturally inollned
than our Indians and where conditions
will permit, they farm and garden ex
tensively, raising principally alfalfa
grapes and. vegetables. Evidence of

They are all Catholics and the best
building in their village Is always their
church. These are built on the style
of the old Spanish missions. Their

a high adobe wall and a huge cross oc

to religion, they are far in advance of
the people of California, according to
their ability We noted a striking
contrast for with them tbelr church
was always the best building in the
village while In California the churches
in most places were far below the av

tho beautiful golden state of fruit and
flowers but she certainly cannot lay
claim to any great amount of Christ
