PROSPECTS FOR
AVERTING STRIKE
GROW BRIGHTER
Railroads Will Accede to Eight-
Hour Day if Given Freight
Rate Increase
PERMANENT BOARD
Want Commission to Handle
Future Labor Troubles; Men
Would Take Secret Vote
By Associated Press
Washington, D. C., Aug. 24. —After
continued conferences to-day between
President Wilson and the select com
mittee of railroad executives the sit
uation surrounding the threatened
strike was described as having nar
rowed down to the following:
The railroad presidents, at least the
select committee of eight, are willing
to accept the eight-hour day insisted
■upon by President Wilson and the
trainmen.
In return they ask that they be
assured as fully as possible that all
proper support be given and proper
means be used to assure them a freight
rate increase from the Interstate Com
merce Commission.
They ask also that Congress create
a permanent board or commisison
similar to the Canadian commission to
handle future labor difficulties. A
commission of this character would be
empowered to investigate when labor
troubles threaten and no strike could
be called or strike vote taken pending
its investigation, a full report of which
would be made public at its conclusion.
At the end of the investigation arbi
tration would be suggested, but if not
accepted, opportunity would be given
to the men to take a strike vote. The
balloting would be secret.
These proposals were communicated
to-day by Commissioner Chambers, of
the Federal Board of Mediation, to the
representatives of the men. who 'ap
parently regarded them favorably.
Judge Chambers then reported to
President Wilson and a subcommittee
of railroad executives was summoned
to the White House. None of them
would say afterward whether Presi
dent Wilson reported the men would
accept the proposal, but it was said
that some encouragement was felt as
a result of the negotiations.
President Wilson is understood to
feel some sympathy for the counter
demands of the railroads and hot
averse to having the men accept them.
It is expected, however, that a vote
of the 640 labor representatives here
must be taken before they can receive
the necessary indorsement.
In the meantime the executives will
continue their conferences among
themselves and another White House
visit may be made later.
Commissioner Chambers, of the
Federal Mediation Board, after con
ferring with President Wilson, carried
a message to the brotherhood leaders.
It was supposed to be some form of
proposal made to President Wilson
last night by the subcommittee of rail
road executives.
It was kept secret, but A. B. Gar
retson, spokesman for the employes,
voiced the opinion of all when he said
it "certainly was not depressing."
Other leaders indicated it was very
satisfactory.
The executives met and heard the
report of the subcommittee which has
been working on a counter proposal
and there were indications that Presi
dent Wilson expected an answer to
day or at the latest to-morrow.
Signs of unrest among the men. so
apparent yesterday, disappeared to
day and there were renewed indi
cations that they would agree upon
some proposal to include the eight

Miles Under Sea
By Associated Press
London, Aug. 24. The departure
for America a week ago of the Ger
man submarine Bremen is reported in
a dispatch from Bremen as forwarded
from The Hague by the Exchange
Telegraph Company. It is said the
owners of the Deutschland and the
Bremen received word seven days ago
of the progress being made by the
Deutschland on her return voyage and
that it was not until they had obtain
ed this information that they permit
ted the Bremen to depart.
The Deutschland took the same
route on both her voyages, the dis
patch says, returning to Germany by
the North Sea. Captain Paul Koejiig
of the Deutschland is being feted as a
national hero and has been summoned
to Emperor William's quarters to re

Traveled 4,200 on Her
Voyage Back to Germany
By Associated Press
London, Aug. 2 4.—Reports of the
return of the German submarine
Deutschland from the United States
are corroborated in a telegram re
ceived at Amsterdam from Bremen,
as forwarded by Reuter's correspon
dent. According to this information
the Deutschland traveled 4,200 miles
on her homeward voyage. At the be
ginning the sea was tempestuous but
later it became more calm. The
Deutschland proved to be able to
navigate the stormy seas excellently.
Her engines worked faultlessly. No
icebergs were passed on the journey.
The American government, says the
dispatch, acted in a correct manner as
a neutral, rigorously enforcing respect
for its frontier from British and
French warships by the employment
of its own men of war. After a Brit
ish cruiser entered Chesapeake Bay at
night, even more effective measures

JOINT COMMISSION
WILL MEET SOON
Border Problems to Be Dis
cussed by U. S. and Mexican
Conferees at Coast Resort
By Associated Press
Washington, D. C., Aug. 24.—Word
from Mexico City was being awaited
at the State Department and the Mex
ican embassy to-day before fixing a
definite date for the first meeting of
the joint American-Mexican commis
sion to discuss border problems. Jt
tentatively has been decided, however,
by Secretary Lansing and Eliseo Arre
dondo, Mexican ambassador designate,
that the commissioners should meet
at some place on the New England
coast during the first week in Sep
tember.
With the session of the commission
virtually at hand, there is much specu
lation here as to the procedure that
will be followed. There is no question
in the minds of officials that the
withdrawal of American troops will be
first taken up, to be followed by the
drafting of a protocol covering future
border operations. It has been stated
officially that the commissioners will
be authorized to submit each agree
ment they shall reach separately to be
acted upon by the two governments.
Some officials think it possible this
will b« the course pursued so that the
commission can build from week to
week on a foundation which has been
satisfied step by step both in Wash
ington and Mexico City.
The third subject outlined for dis
cussion by General Carranza is an in
vestigation of the interests behind bor
der raids. What that investigation will
develop into no official is permitted to
predict. It may take the commission
to the border or it may be turned over
to the secret, service agents of both
governments for preliminary investi
gation while the commission busies
itself with other matters.
Mercury Falls 18 Degrees
in Hour After Storm
Relief from the heat reached Har
risburg last night when the hot wave
passed out after a freakish thunder
storm of several hours. The record
yesterday was 88 degrees. Betwoen
7 and 8 o'clock last night the mercury
fell 18 degrees. At midnight it was 69
degrees.
The coolest period was at 6 o'clock
this morning with a temperature of
64 degrees. Two hours later it was
two degrees warmer; and the maxi
mum fixed for to-day was 80 degrees.
To-day and to-morrow will be fair
and cooler according to to-day's fore
cast.
The warm spell reported to be head
ed this way and due about Saturday,
may not reach Harrisburg at all. The
stiff breezes from the north and west
sidetracked this heat wave. There will
be some warmer days, but the kind
that makes a human soul forget his
religion is over for the season, accord
ing to the belief of Weather Observer
E. R. Demain.

them all their lives, he said, and was
fond of them. Anna, the oldest, is 18
and her sister, Alice, is 16 years old.

Inquiring Into Seizure
of U. S. Fishing Boats
By Associated Press
London, Aug. 24.—Inquirers are
being made of the Rrltish Govern
ment by Robert P. Skinner, the Amer
ican Consul General, as to the cause
of the seizure of the American fish-1
ing schooners, Maxine Elliott and Liz
zie Griffin, off the coast of Iceland.
The vessels wer taken into Lerwick,
Shetland Islands, by a Rrltish patroi
boat.
The number of American boats fish
ing oft Iceland is not believed to l»e
great. Consequently It is felt here
that the two schooners may have
been seized in a general raid on fish
ing craft in those waters to forestall
the possibility of their catches reach
ing Germany.

Von Hindenburg Takes Offen

Charges Stopped
The drive of the Bulgarian army
against the allied right flank on the
Macedonian front apparently develop
ed into a sharper clash with the en
tente forces and greater losses to
them than had previously been indi
cated, judging from the official report
received from Sofia to-day.
A severe defeat was administered to
General Sarrail's troops along the
Struma river, northeast of Saloniki, on
August 21, the statement declares, the
entente' forces taking flight, leaving
the field covered with dead, and aban
doning quantities of munitions and
supplies including eight machine guns.
.Bulgarians Entrenching
The Bulgarian forces have now en
trenched themselves on the east bank
of the Struma and along the highway
to Seres," according to the French offi
cial report to-day. Their positions
here lie in the way of an allied ad
vance along the most direct route into
Bulgaria. Reports as to conditions
along the front in the Balkans are
conflicting, un the entente sides it is
announced that the Serbians have suc
cessfully taken the offensive along the
western end of the line, capturing a
height near Lake Ostrovo,while Berlin
declares the Bulgarians are the ag
gressors in the fighting in this region.
Apparently no important movement is
as yet in progress on the center where
the main thrust of the entente is ex
pected.
