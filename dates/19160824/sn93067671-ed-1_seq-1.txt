Dr. John .G. Clinkscales, former
candidate for Governor of South
Casolina and professor at Wofford
College, says:
*"My regular summer work for
Wofford College in particular, and
for education in general, has taken
me over many counties, .and I feel
quite sure, after watching closely
the. trend of things, that Governor
Manning will succeed himself. In
my judgment the Governor is gain
ing round every day. The opehi,

fight all ualong for .good, c.en gdyv

of the people as the election day ap
proaches.
"Many good men who would per

didates are beginning to feel as does
Dr. McCaIn; that to vote at this
time for any other would be evidence
of a fdtilure to appreciate an honest

government.

Thomas F. McDow, a prominent
attorney of York, says:
"I am supporting Governor Mdan
ning for re-election:
"Because ho is a man of ability,
purity of characte- and a patriot
who is devoted to the best ,jnterests
of South Carolina.
- "Because he 'has been strong
enough to advocats measures in the
interest of the'masses of the people
against ' the powerful protest of
former friends of wealth, power and
influence.
"Because on all occasions and
everywhere he has conducted him
self so as to reflect credit upon the
high offi' to which the people of
South Carolina have eleeted hiini:
"Because during'~ lai.pa1istra-.
tion there has been: 'n'9 unseemly
*quarrel between the Governor .and
t' gGeneral assembly and the Gov
eio and the Judiciary. He has
,received the -respect of ,every do.
partment of government and- has
tiIsated the other departments of
government with that 'respect and
courtesy to whielt they are entitled
fromn'the Executive.
"Because, in my opinion, he has
made one of the best governors the
state has had since. 1876, and on his'
merits and by established custom; he
is entitled to a second term.
"For these reasons I am support
ing .Governor Manning, notwith
standing the fact that personally I
have the highest respect and regard
for Mr. Cooper."
