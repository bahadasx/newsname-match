" Sickness 99
The Editor is at a Sanitarium. Here are a thousand
people, gathered from forty States, all seeking health.
It shows that health is something precious. These
people atependinff time and money, and neglecting
friends, business and pleasure to get it. Vet most of
them by a little care could have kept the good health
which they once had!
And we are reminded that some suffering is the lot
of all men. Age at last will overtake us. Everybody
should make friends with weakness and get ready to be
happy without much strength of body at the close of life.
And the weakness of our human bodies gives occa
sion for a world of patience, skill and kindness.
The leper raited not the gold from
the dust;
"Better to me the poor man's crust,
Better the blessing! of the poor.
Though I turn me empty from his
door;
Th.it is no true alms which the hand
can hold;
He gives nothing but worthless
gold
Who gives from a tense of duty:
But he who gives a sjender mile.
And gives to that which is out of
igbt,
That thread of all sustaining beauty
Which runs through all and doth
all unite
The hand cannot claap the whole of
his alms.
The heart outstretches its eager
palms,
For God goes with its store
To thewul that was starving in
darkness before."
From Lowell's "Visions of 8ir
Launfal."

Blessed is the man who in his
youth
Is filled with tyting love of truth,
Whose thought Is free from vulgar
phrase
That often comes in youthful days.
For 'tis the thought that builds the
soul
And makes the self a perfect whole;
It is the thought that ushers in
The awful tragedies of sin.
For oh how oft the evil thought
Has eyil on the thinker brought;
A thought in innocence begun
That closed with life and love undone.
Vice is a monster of so frightful

RAIL HEADS MAY
COME TO PLAII
Wilson Makes Appeal to Pa
triotlsmof Executives.
ATMOSPHERE IS CHANGED
Presidents Expected to Aocede te
Wilson's Plan of Settling Strike at
the Same Time Securing All Con
eesalone They Can.
Washington. Aug. II. President
Wilson renewed his demand for aa
eight-hour day by the railroads and
gave aolemn warning that harmony
such as would guarantee efficiency
was most essential to national pre
paredness. He hinted at complies?
tlons which might result from the
European war. Ho intimated a strike
would likely result In an adverse ver
dict against the railroads by tas
"great American Jury-"
The exeoutlvoa were unexpectedly
called to the Whit House with as
little formality as would hare been
observed in sending for a congression
al committee. The gathering Included
U W. Hill, of the Great Northern, and
many other new arrivals. The presi
dent greeted the assembled officials
In the Blue room. His manner was
aa solemn as the brief address which
followed. The effect Is believed to
have placed the executives wholly on
the defensive. It is understood' they
will not go again to the White House
until they can find aome compromise
plan to offer.
At a point where he exhibited the
greatest concern over the outcome.
President Wilson aaid:
"I will not allow passion to corns
Into my thoughts in this solemn mat
ter. We are both acting as trustees
of great interests. I am willing to al
tow the matter to go to the American
Jnrv and let them assess the respon
sibility. The responsibility of failure
will not rest with me.
"T wish you to consider the conse
quences aa affecting the people In the
cities and the countryside of a failure
to agree. The country cannot live if
the means of keeping alive Its vitality
are interferred with.
"The lives and fortunes of 100.000,
000 men. women and children many
of whom may die depend on what
may be done In thla room. I appear
to you as one American cltlien to an
other to avert thia disaster.
No Strike.
Persons qualified to speak for the
executives are more confident there
will be no strike. The Impression pre
vailed that ultimately the executives
and managers will give In to Presi
dent Wilson, securing at the same
time all concessions they can from
the White House. The atmosphere la
changed. t
Louis W. Hill, of the Great Northern-,
who reoently declared he would
not yield to President Wilson's de
mand that tho roade concede the eight
hour day, declined to' talk, but said
he had not changed hia views since
he left the west.
It waa evident that the western
railroad heads were more defiant than
those already here. They are ta favor
of opposing President Wilson's pro
gram. There Is a growing Impression the
railroad executives will consider that
they have made the most of the situa
tion If they can obtain some definite
guarantee that they will be Indemnr
fled against possible loss If they ac
cept the president's proposal.
In addition the railroads desire
President Wilson to premise them
that. In the Interest of the principle
of arTfltratlon, he will use his Influ
ence in congress to pass legislation
making another crisis like the pres
ent Impossible. Two plans are under
consideration. The first embraces
only compulsory arbitration. The oth
er includes compulsory arbitration
but provides for secret strike ballots.
The latter plan la much In favor, It
waa said and would be based upon the
MacKenile-KIng legislation In Cana
da. It would create a government
commission, which would investigate
every serious Industrial dispute af
fecting Interstate traffic before a
strike vote could be takea.
All Washington Is discussing the
possibilities of government operation
of the railroads If a strike Is called.
It waa aaid there Is ao precedent for
such a step by the government
"We are not worrying any more
than we did. There dees not seem to
mo to be anything to worry about,'
said one of the brotherhood members.
"We are Just sitting and waiting.
The next move Is up to President Wil
son. And I think If, the railroad offl
etals refuse his plan he will move
fast .1 do not believe he will give
them say time at all before he urges
oongrosslooal aotloa. I would not be
a bit surprised to have aim recom
mend govorameat oontrol at once."
WORLD HEWS"
saw
On the western frontier of the
war the English continue to make
small but steady gains, In the region
of the Somme River, around Verdun,
the French have been successful In
driving the Germans out of Fleury
an outpost of considerable importance.
On the eastern frontier of the
war the week has been one of added
success for the Russians. In places
they have crossed the Stockhod
river and have taken towns along
the way toward Kovel, the object of
their present efforts. They are also
fighting on the crest of the Carpa
thian Mountains and are able to
look down on the Hungarian Plains.
The Italian advance toward Trisle, '
tho seaport of Austria, has stopped
the present. The Italians are mov
ing very cautiously and will not .
make the final attack until they
strenghten their forces, a desperate
effort wifl be made by the Austrians
to keep Triste.
An advance movement has begun
during the week from Salonika, in
Greece. The final object will be
the recovery of Servia from the
central powers. The Bulgarians
and Turks are offering the opposi
tion.. The movement thus far has
been little more than a trial of
strength.
Tlie London Times, one of the most
influential papers of England, in an
Editorial says that the United
States has lost its chance to take
any important part in the settle
ment that will follow the war be
cause of its lack of sympathy for
England and her allies.
Maxim Gorky, the Russian writer,
has issued a warning to the Russian
people. He sets forth an alarming
amount of graft and dishonesty
among the official classes in Russia,
and of immortality among the mas
ses, together with a growing de
sire for luxuries.
A regular bombshell was thrown
into President's Mexican policy by
a telegram from general Funston,
advising the removal of. the Ameri
can troops under command of Per
shing, from Mexican soil. He said
they had practically done what they
have been sent to do and were rest
less doing nothing.

Washington, Aug. 23. The current
phase of the Mexican aituation la now
believed to bo near a solution.
The American delegates to the bor
der conference will be Instructed to
comply with Carranxa's demand that
American troops be withdrawn from
Mexico, but on three conditions.
Carrania must first sign an agree
ment to maintain 20,000 Mexican
troops along the frontier to co-operate
with 10,000 American troops In pre
serving order.
As aa alternative, Carrania may
agree to the establishment of a neu
tral sons on the Mexican side of tho
border la which American troops may
operate against bandits.
f Finally Carrania must sign aa
agreement guaranteeing protection to
Americana and their property la Mex
ico. Following a conference between
Secretary of State Lansing and Secre
tary Tumulty, It waa aaid that the
names of American members of the
commission would probably be an
aounced after tho cabinet meeting.
Officials admitted that "Carrania was
getting uneasy" ovor thla govern
moot's, delay In naming its delegates.
