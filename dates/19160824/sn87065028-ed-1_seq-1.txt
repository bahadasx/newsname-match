Was.ungton, Aug. 22. Eigh:
presidents of important railway iys
tems vh'. have been designated ti
draft the railroad's reply to President
Wilson's appeal that they accept his
plan for averting a nation-wide strike
were in almost continuous session to
day and tonight, without solving their
problem. Late tonight three of the
committeemen, Hale Holden of the
Burlington; R. S. Lovett of the Union
Pacific and Daniel Willard of the Bal
timore and Ohio, discussed the situa
tion with the President. They were at
the White House for more than an
hour and on leaving declined to talk
about their visit further than to say
they had asked for the conference to
"discuss the general situation," and
expected to see the President again.
Although some 60 or more presi
dents are showing a disposition to pro
long the negotation in the hope that
the sentiment of business men of the
country will be shown opposed to the
idea of an eight-hour day, there was
a general feeling tonight that a defi
nite answer to President Wilson's de
mand cannot be much longer post
poned. The President is understood
to have indicated that he desired his
proposal to be fully debated by the
executives, but their; conferences
among themslves nave failed so far to

cus the situaUon tonight, they still
ore insistent upon an arbitration of
the eight-hour day and all other is
sues with the employes. As the con
ferences continued there was less
talk of action which would lead to a
strike, but some of the executives are
expected to fight to the last ditch any
plan wh'ch would force an eight
hour day upon the roads without
some form of arbitration.
"Wild Bill" Latura Killed.
"Wild Bill" Latura, the noted Mem
phis outlaw, was killed in that city on
Tuesday night by two policemen. The
following brief account of the killing
appeared in yesterday's Commercial-
Appeal:
"Bill Latura, gun man and des
perado, with a record of having killed
six of seven men, was killed at 12:30
Tuesday night by two policemen who
were entering his place on Poplar
Avenue to search for liquor or beer.
"Latura was shot four times and
instantly killed.
"He had drawn a gun and started
firing at the officers.
"lie had been a persistent law
Violator, his place having been raided
at least once a week recently. He
was under a penitentiary sentence on
a charge of gaming.
"He figured in a shooting affray 10
years ago in which he killed four ne
groes and wounded several others,
hut escaped o trial by pleading in
sanity.."
Mr. John Moody of Bent Oak spent
Monday in the city.

While reports from other sections
Indicate better crop prospects, there

market more than 6,000 bales.
The flood which visited this section
in July not only ruined cotton, but
other crops as well, and one grower
who sold 40 cars of alfalfa last year
states that his entire yield this season
will not amount to 10 ear loads.

TAKES HEIGHTS FROM BULGARS,
BUT WINGS ARE PRESSED
BACKWARD.
Paris. Aug. 23. The allies have
captured a series of heights west of
the Vardar River, on the haloniki
front, says a war office statement to
night. On both wings advance de
tachments have fallen back before the
counter offensive of the Bulgarians in
the battle continued on Aug. 21, on
the whole front of the allied armies
on the Saloniki line. In the center
the British-French forces have vio
lently bombarded Bulgarian positions
on both sides of Lake Doiran, while
our infantry established itself in the
southern spurs of the Beles Moun
tains. "West of the Vardar our. troops
have occupied a line of heights near
Ljumnica and have mantained their
I positions at all points in spite of
violent counter attacks by the enemy.
"The Servian army has continued
its progress in the mountainous zone
between the Cerna and Moglenica
Rivers. On the two wings the enemy,
at the cost of very heavy losses, has
succeeded in pushing back our ad
vance detachments. On one end of
the line the covering detachment,
which attacked on Aug. 20 west of
Seres, Bulgarian forces more than a
division in strength, in order to de
lay their march, has fallen back on
the Struma. All the passages of the
river are solidly held by the allies,
On the extreme left wing the Servian
army, after a very hot battle lasting
two days, which was undertaken to
retard the advance of the right wing
of the Bulgarians, has retaken its
nrincioal defensive position in the
neighborhood of Lake Ostrovo."

JUST II THE Clll CASE
COUNCIL FOR DEFENDANT WILL
ASK SECOND TRIAL BEFORE
COURT ADJOURNS.
Meridian, Miss, Aug. 23. The Jury
in the case of Jack Clarke, char?"d
wi'h the murder of Luther Slnrp, at
A .-x'ork Mc;.uuy afternoon reputed
its inability to reach an agreement an 1
was discharged by Judge Heidelberg.
The jury stood seven for conviction
and five for acquittal. The jury be
gan its deliberations at 9:35 Satur
day night and from the first to the
last ballot the vote was the same. At
noon today the members reported
, they could not agree on a verdict, but
I Judge Heidelberg sent them back for
further deliberation. Four hours later
when they asked to be heard they con
vinced Judge Heidelberg that it was
impossible for them to reach an
agreement and were dismissed.
Marion W. Reily leadirg cour-;I
for the defense, stated that they
would ask for another trial of th
case Ht this term of court ami if tirr o
was l ot granted they would ask bond
for their client, who has been in jafl
since the killing in April, having Ven
rYnied bond by Justice Moody Price
at the preliminary hearing.
Today a flaw was found in the in
dictment of Tom Childress, a white
man charged with killing a negro wo
man in this city several months past.
The indictment charged murder but
failed to use the word "wilful." Judge
Heidelberg reduced Childress' bond
from $1,000 to $500 for his appear
ance before the next term of court,
when the grand jury will again in
vestigate his cane. Childress has
been in jail since the killing, not hav
ing been able to make bond.
Luther Hicks, indicted for murder,
by agreement entered a plea of guilty
to manslaughter and was sentenced
to five years in the pentetitiary.

The shortage of freight cars, which

and has brought inconvenience to
many local manufacturing industries
The Columbus Lumber Company was
forced to shut down last Saturday, but

plants are being prevented from mak

Superintendent Pigford, of hc M.

a time when he was conversing with
Mrs. Sykes regarding a lunch, which

The Amount of Money Re
ceived from Distribution. Z
Prof. S. M. Nash, who for 20 years
was superintendent of education in
this county, was recently named by
the board of supervisors to make a
supplementary enumeration of the
educable children that are in the bor
ders of the county, and hia work has
resulted in adding nearly 1,000 more
names to the roll submitted by the tai
assessor.
Prof. Nash, on account of his long
service, and his familiarity with the
conditions here, was able to locate
quite a number of children who were
overlooked by the assessor and h'
assistants in the original count. The
fact that 1,000 additional names have
been added to the roll is very grati
fying to the supervisors, as the dis
tribution of the state school funi
based on the number of educable
children in each county, and this in
creased number will therefore add
materially to Lowndes county's share
of the fund.

Conducting Sanitary Campaign.
Local health officials are conduct

officers are making a close inspection
of every business house and resident
in the city limits. The city recently
adopted an ordinance requiring all
householders, who are not connected
with the sewerage system and who
use surface toilets to have the same
properly screened so that flies and
other insects cannot enter them. The
ordinance went into effect several
weeks ago, and officials have recently
completed an inspection for the pur
pose of seeing that its provisions have
been properly complied with.
Mayor Gunter and other local of
