LIVELY?PERSONAL. I
Lake City. August 22:?It seems 1
that some of our farmers have been 1
awakened by the recent disaster to *
the necessity of draining their lands. .
Several projects are on foot for or- |
ganizing ana estaonsning arainage .
districts and issuing bonds from the
sale of which to raise the money
with which to do the work. Some
are in the process of organization,
while others are taking shape. Those
actually on foot are between here
and Olanta and here and Kingstree.
The resident land owners in two of
the proposed districts have already
met and signed up the pan-as necessary
to set the machinery of establishment
in motion. The largest of
the proposed districts id Kingstree
Swamp district. This extends from
the head of Kingstree swamp near j
Olanta to Black river just above
Kingstree?about eighteen or twenty
miles. The idea is to open this [
swamp by a canal sufficiently large J
to drain thoroughly all the lands ly- ]
ing on both sides of the swamp and 1
within the basin.

up to the appearance of this issue
of The Record will amount to '
about three million pounds. Two
and a half million pounds had been
sold up to last Saturday night, and ,
this week it has been coming in on
an average of a hundred and fifty
thousand pounds a day. The prices i
continue good?in fact, they are as
: high as at any time during the sea1
son to date. <
The plant of the Imperial Tobacco
Co is not running full time. Five
hundred hands are employed. This i
I does not include office men, engin- *
! eers,firemen, etc, but only the hands |
1 at work in the factory itself. The
leaf tobacco bought by this company
at all the markets in the State is 1
handled at this plant, where it goes i
through all the Drocesses necessary I:
to prepare it for export.
Last week we stated that the Lake <
City News had been purchased by
Messrs M K Gravely and Mark Smith.
! Now we understand that Mr Gravej
ly has nothing to do with the paper,
| but that Mr Smith and P H Arrowsmith,
Esq, are the buyers.
Mr Paul Caldwell, who now lives
in Rock Hill,is here visiting relatives
; at his old home.
Mayor W R Scott came up from
i Kingstree in his car Sunday and
spent the day in town.
Mrs M D Pye and young son of
Wilmington are visiting the former's
parents, Mr and Mrs J M Sturgeon.
I Congressman J W Ragsdale will
deliver a political address here at 3
p. m. Thursday. The public, of

Mr P G Gourdin of Kingstree was
here Tuesday on business connected
with surveying some lands in the vicinity.
Have you ever seen a white frog?
Well, Mr Sturgeon, J M, found one
Tuesday morning in his fig bush. It
was somewhat smaller than a toad
frog, and of light gray color?practically
white. It was also a fine
jumper.
Mr Everett Miller, who comes
from Greenwood, now has a position
in the mercantile establishment of
Mr A B Brick. By the way, Dr
Steele says that the middle "B"
ought to be rubbed out of Mr Brick's
name, for he is really "a brick".
Dr and Mrs Jennings and sons of
Bishopville motored down Sunday to
visit relatives. Mrs Jennings and the
boys will remain several days.
Young Williams, son of Mr A B

Call tor Contributions Urged by |1
Committees in Charge,
Messrs W M O'Bryan, Heinemann,
J N Hammet, County Supervisor, C
ind Geo A McElveen, King9tree, E
lave been named as a special com- 8
nittee by the State Central comnittee
recently appointed by Gov- E
?rnor Manning, to handled relief E
funds for storm and flood sufTerers
n this State. The above gentlemen s;
nave charge of the State relief fund
n this county. This fund is being E
raised by public subscription, and 0
-he above committee will co-operate
with those in charge of the federal
relief fund. Mr O'Brvan is chair- r
man of the committee, and as it is
mpossible for him- or the other mem- (
oers to get in personal touch with r
those needing aid it is requested
that reports of such cases be sent a
them in order that help may be pro- t
rided, especially to destitute women A
ind children.
It is also urged that parties in a s
position to do so send contributions f
to this fund to either of the abcve
named gentlemen or to this paper. fSeveral
weeks ago Governor Man- >>
ning issued a general call for donations
and a liberal response has been f
made, but as the demand upon this '!
fund is great, it is necessary to raise 8
more money, and it is hoped that all
who can will contribute liberally. a
.\ny funds received by The Record ^
will bcr accounted for and turned *
over to the State Central committee
of which Mr T W Boyle of Greely- 0
ville is a memlvr.
Will Sloao's Liniment Relieve Pain? r

will prove more than a column of g
claims. James S Ferguson, Phila, v
Pa, writes: "I have had wonderful
relief since I used Sloan's Liniment J
on my knees. To think after all I
these years of pain one application I
gave me relief. Many thanks for 1
what your remedy has done for me." c
Do not keep on suffering, but apply t
Sloan's Liniment where your pain
is and noti- e how quickly you get i j
relief. Penetrates without rubbing. |
