WASHINGTON, D. , Aug. 24.
Announcement today by the 33 rail
road executives who have been in
conference- witn president wnson;
on the point they have hitherto re
fused, and simultaneously gives 'more
hope for averting a strike of 400,000
employee than has been In prospect
: for several' days. '
After continued conferences with
tne presiaent at tne wmte Mouse to
' day and yesterday, the select commit-
tee representing the railroad execu
tives gives out the following state
ment of Its attitude: V';; .-"
The. railroad presidents' are willing
: to accept the eight-hour day demanded

surtnees of his support and that of
the government to secure permission
from the Interstate Commerce Com-

' At the end of such Investigation ar
bitration will be suggested to settle
the outstanding , points, but In , the
event of no acceptance of arbitration
opportunity will be given, for a. strike

loting shall be secret :: , .'
The representatives of the men are
apparently favorably dispoied to ac
cept the plan and Indications of the
arrival ' at an undeaandlng are
brighter. It le'felt AlVat the erlsis
has been passed.
. The quer.tion of hew the railroads
are to sret the additional reventiA thev

are to grant; the demand' of the men

It is Understood that the railroad
i. ' rilZ V ..r'.V
of tne full demands of the men
would mean, an additional $100,000,000
a year to the payrolls of the lines. .
Claim Men are Well Paid.
' They declare that the roads are
now paying 44 cents out of every dol
lar earned to their employes, and
that themen are now getting far more
money than other workers In similar
classes of employment. They adder:
'h t this money would mean the equ
valent of 5 per cent advance on all
freight rates. ; '

cerH of the Hawaiian Department of

sion, as now seems almost certain.:
Plans are well un,der way for the
building of an aerial research station
for the purpose of obtaining first
hand information as to action of the
trades and anti-trade winds at eleva
tions high enough to be influenced by
local atmospheric, conditions. How
deep the trade winds are; at what
elevation the air ceases to flow to
ward the equator and starts back to
ward the cold regions of the north
and Its exact direction , and velocity
while undergoing this change pre
questions soon to be answered for the
scientists of all countries by the wea
ther bureau's big Oahu observatory.
A letter received by local authori
ties cf the War Department from
Prof. Chas. F. Marvin, chief of the
weather bureau. . Washington, D. C,
gives promise of the early realization
of the hope of many scientific men
who are Interested in Hawaii and the
Pacific islands generally.';
This Is npthicgr less than the estab
lishing here of an aerological etation,

maintained by the U. S. Weather Bu
reau. aLd requiring the services of
ts most skilful scientific research
men. . 1
Several months ago local officers of
the coast artillery observed that in
making their calculations for the
flight of t lie big 8h ells from the mor
tars, which go up as high as 12.000
or 15,000 feet, the projectile would
often fall so far wide of tbe mark as
to make it seem certain that the act-
cn of -tht wind in the upper strat3
of air was totally different from that
Indicated by the local surface winds.
So kites . were built here and flown
from Diamond Head crater, but none
of them were large enough nor strong
enougn to get above the strata of
surface -winds. The local officers
then sought the aid o! the meteorol
ogist in charge of the Honolulu sta
tion, but he could only tell theifr what
could be done, but could not furnish
the material for doing the work.

HILO, Aug. 24-Manager William
G. Oeg of Pahala '.plantation was
found dead, with the top-of his head
blown off, yesterday afternoon. It was
evidently a case of suicide. He had
left the dining table ;at his home on
Mandav evenina
and Was missing un-
til the body was found, near the, Half-
kiiw Uauw an the countv road from
h Volcano House to Pahala. The
u,;( n k nrtiund mom dl-
tance from his automobile and a re-
volver Was lying alngside the body.
The remains have been shipped to
Honolulu on the steamer Mauna Kea.
Without leaving any explanation,-so
far as can yet be learned, William G.
Ogg, for many years connected with
the Hawaiian Agricultural Company
and its manager since 1904, is dead
by his own hand.. Advices of .his death
were received by C Brewer & Co
agents for the company, yesterday
afternoon, but with the facts that he
had died and that his body 'would be
brought here the information ended.
Wireless messages from Hilo after
Brewer & Co. had closed their offices
for the night, Wednesday gave details
of the finding of the body of Ogg
lying near his automobile about 100
yards from the old Halfway House on
the county road Jead&g between Pa
hala'and the Volcano Houses Close at
hand was a 32-caliber rtvolver and he
had been shot in the mouth.
. The wireless states that although
Ogg had been absent from the plaiita:
tion since Monday, his wife andlhoffe
at the plantation thought he had gone
to Hilo and felt no alarm. He had
spent the morning of Monday with
the entomologist of the planters' asso
ciation," O. H.J Swezey, talking over
plantation matters an left him with
the stated intentionof going to the
lower end of the plantation to aee
to the extinguishing of a fire there.
Nothing unusual '.n his manner was
noted at that time. ,
At the office of Brewer & Co. this
morning it was said that the news of
the suicide came as a complete pur
prise. The . report that plantation
worries was the moving reason for
his act was discredited. Leaf hopper
plague has affected the crop of the
plantation both this year and last to
the extent of something like 6000 tons
and this had made the manager rather
blue, but more recently he' had seem
ed to brighten up. That recently
there had been dry weather was noth
ing unusual at Pahala and tbe agents
do not believe that business worries
can be blamed for his suicide. Friends
here who have long known him take
the same view.
William G, ' Ogg was a native of
Aberdeen, Scotland, and came to Ha
waii In 1888 with James Gibb, who Is
now manager of the Honolulu Planta
tion Company. He first went to Wala-
kea, Hawaii, and became stable luna.
He rose rapidly until in six years he
became plantation manager for the
Hawaiian Agricultural Company. In
1893 he married a Miss Campbell. The
couple had no children.

of Attorney Lorrin Andrews, who de
clared today that, in the matter of the

"The situation." says Andrews.
' was this: The police, without a

after a search, found a set of Chinese

there could be betting on the game.
"District Magistrate Monsarrat
found them guilty. If this is so. then
the police may go to any house, break
down the door, rout out some check
ers and arrest those living in the
house. We hold that no offense has
been committed and the cases will be
