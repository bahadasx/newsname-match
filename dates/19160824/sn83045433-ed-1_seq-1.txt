Reno, Nav., Aug. 23.-Candidate Hughes
declared in his address here this after-I

conduct in failing to protect the rights of
American citizens in Mexico has cut
down the national prestige one-half.
All Nevada turned out to welcome the.

ever, to describe the occasion as other
than a nonpartisan greeting to a famous

the divorce colony, took part.

Ycork it was apparent that 93 per cent of
what I was dIoing as head of the admitn
istrative work had nothing to do with
politics. It did not make any differenne,
whether men were temocrats or Repub

the question was to get economically
and thoroughly done by conpetent
men.
The Nevadans cheered that sentiment
just as they cheered the dcena-nd for a
protective tariff and the demand for a

olinion here is that W"ilson will carry
