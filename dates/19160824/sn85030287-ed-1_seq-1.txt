The Nebraska Theatre 'Com
pany will have a representative
in Meade during the Fair. Pic
tures of the various exhibits' will
be taken, together' with those of
the business houses and the
principal streets of the cityThe
, second week after the Fair these
pictures will be shown at Phelps
Theatre for three, evenings,
; i- -which will give everyone an op
"portuhity'to see them. The pic
ture of the grand parade in front
of the grand stand on the last
day of the Fair will also bettak
en. After having been shown at
& the Theatre the films will be
s come the property of the "Fair
. Association to do with as they
see fit.
.. This feature will no .'doubt
prove an excellent advertising
1 medium for Meade County.
The M. & M. Drug Co. is in
-receipt of a letter from the pub
lishers of the State school books,
stating that, owing to the scar
city of print paper and material
tbat much delay in getting books
this year may be looked for. It
would prcbably be advisable for
students to get their books as
early as possible
.Awaits Court's Action
.A man wliogave bis name as
J. S, Bittner, and who aid his
home was in Oklahoma City,
. was picked up on ti.e streets
this morning, either sphering-
.from tie effects of a sun stroke,
ortbe absence of, -"dope".
He was placed in jail, awaiting
the further action of the court.
We trust that their action will
be as speedy as possible, that
Meade county may not be bur
dened with aboard and doctor
bill for which some other county
.and state should be responsible.
itecently signs were posted ;at
all main roads entering Meade,
marked, "city limits, 10 miles .an
hour, city limits," yet there is
seldom a day passes but that
. irom one to a dozen cars may be
. seen upon the streets of Meade,
running at more than twice the
speed limit. If we are .going to
have;a speed limit, it seems only
right that it should be regarded,
y And .those who will not should be
called to .account. It isn't after
an accident has happened, per
haps caused by someorie speed
ing, that this should be regard
. ' ed, but before. What's the use
' to lock the stable after th horse
. is stolen?
Fair Booster Trip
The fair management is now
arranging for a booster trip,
same to occur either the last of
this week or the first of next,
their itinerary to include Fowler,
Missler, Plains, and some points
in the south part of the county,
not at this time decided upon.
All those who can go on the trip,
or who will furnish cars, are re
quested to report to the manage
ment at once. The more cars,
the more interest the more in
terest the better the fair. As to
whether or not the whole trip
will be made in one day, we are
not advised, but if you are inter
ested, see F. Fuhr and he will in
all probability be in position to
give you full details. From the
number of cars in Meade and
surrounding communities, fifty
ought easily to be secured. A
delegation from Fowler and
from Plains will also join the
boosters. Don't wait until some
member of the Fair Association
asks you to join the party, but
go at once and volunteer the use
of your car. This will greatly
aid in getting a good big lot of
interest aroused, and a pleasant,
profitable trip will , be the- outcome.
MEADE CO.
GETS RAIN
The First In Many Weeks
Will Make Feed Crop
" Everyone is justly rejoicing
since the rain which came the
first of the week.' The percipita
tionwas about an inch, and be
ing . unaccompanied by wind,
every drop went into the ground.
Previous to the rain, which
was the first in about six weeks,
Meade County witnessed one of
the driest .spells 'we have had in
years, and the dust well, if we
were not good natured we would
perljaps have ;all been in the
"bug house" by now; but the
rain came, the feed crop is
saved, therground is in good con
dition for .plowing, and we are
all. happy.
In some parts of the county a
heavier fall has been reported,
while in others not so much, but
im;all4iust.iand unjust .alike, we
were all well remembered.
Strange as it may seem, with
all :the dry weather and wind,
we have heard of no feed being
badly damaged, and under pres
ent conditions will easily be up
to the standard of previous
years.
Harry Rich, one of the world's
best known trapeze performers,
has been employed by the Fair
Association and will be here at
that time to help entertain the
crowd?. Mr. Rich dees some
seemingly impossible feat.". For
instance he will pull three auto
mobiles, with occupants, or five
empty cars with his teeth. From
the top of the "First National
Bank building he will have erect
eel a trapeze and each morning
(luring the Fair will give a per
formance, going from there to
the Fair grounds for the remain
der 'of the day, and will give
from two to three exhibitions
daily in front of the grand stand.
This is only one of the many at
tractions which the Association
has secured for your entertain
ment during Fair week. The
attraction herewith mentioned
will certainly be well worth see
ing, as Mr. Rich has won both
reputation ;and praise in many of
the larger cities for his daring
trapeze performances.
Wheat Market Good
Threshing and wheat hauling
continue in this locality. We are
advised by 1he managers of the
elevators of our city that the car
shortage has been, greatly re
lieved within the past ten days,
and that up to the time of the
rain, the wheat raisers kept
them fcusy bying wheat. Since
the rain, the condition of the
roads has shortened the amount
received, though as soon as they
become a little dry, the usual
amount of hauling will be ' re
sumed. Wednesday the price paid was
$1.38 per bushel, which is con
sidered good. No better, how
ever, than the quality of the
wheat, nearly all of which is
testing from 61 to 63 pounds.
x To-day, Thursday, the price
is $1.40."
Dr. Martindale is well known
among Methodists in Bucklin
and throughout southwestern
Kansas. He was district super
intendent in this territory for 12
years, journeying from east of
Pratt over all the territory far
down into Oklahoma; in fact,
one of his points of visit was
near Clayton, New Mexico. Af
ter completing his long term of
service in the largest district in
Kansas, he retired from the ac
tive ministry at the age of near
ly 70. He was succeeded by Rev.
Bums, and he in turn by Rev.
Dadisman, who is now in charge
of the district. All who are ac
quainted with Dr. Martindale
will be shocked to learn of his
nearness-" to; death, BucklinJ

Steam Laundry Opens
Announcement of the opening
of the Meade Steam Laundry on
Monday, August 28th, appears
in today's News. Mr. 0. R. Fol
lett, the owner and manager, has
had years of experience in the
laundry business, and assures us
that he is coming to Meade with
the view of staying with us, and
giving us one of the best and
most up-to-date establishments
in the west, so long as the busi
ness given him justifies same.
There is no reason why he
should not receive a generous
share of patronage, and if he
does, he will maintain for us a
business that will be a credit to
our city. . Mr. Follett comes here
from Liberal, and with his fam
ily will become our. best citizens.
All he asks is an opportunity to
prove to us what he will do, in
the way of first class laundry
work. He is starting-a line of
business worthy of the support
of our people, and will no doubt
receive it.
We are going to have a big cir
cus in Meade next Monday, Aug
ust the 28th, so the bills and the
advertisement elsewhere in to
day's News say. They boast of
the best troups of trained ele
phants traveling, kangaroos di
rect from Australia, a fine col
lection of black maned African
lions, a whole herd of zebras, a
drove of Siberian camels, "Cup
id" the educated pony, the larg
est calliope in the world, and
some of the best acrobats living.
Good music will be rendered and
good order maintained. Don't
forget the date, and the big tent.
The city reservoir is complet
ed with the exception of the top.

CITY BUYS
SPRINKLER
Same Will Be In Operation
With A Short Time
We are pleased to have to an
nounce tbat the City has pur
chased the street sprinkfer from
A. M. McCay and as soon as the
big reservoir at the city pump
ing plaiit is completed, thereby
insuring a sufficient water sup
ply, they will have same in oper
ation. Another item of importance to
our people is tbat the value of
the city property of Meade has
increased $100,000 sioce the re
port of the assessor a year ago.
Leaving the tax levy tbe same
as last year, enough money will
be raised to enable the City to
employ a man, whoe duty it
will be to operate tbe street
sprinkler, drag the street, and
cut tbe weeds.
If tbe right sort of a man can
be employed, one who will give
his attention to all parts ff tbe
city alike, there isn't a taxpayer
in town who will register an ob
jection. In fact, if this money
i priperly expended it will be
one of the tnstand wisest invest
ments the present City adminis
tration ever mad
Granting that'they will do a'l
this, and 10 the best of their
ability, Tha News commends
our City fathers on their move.

Professional Institute
The First Meade County Pro
fessional Institute will convene
at the High School building in
Meade next Monday, August
28th,-at-9:00 a. m.
The Professional Institute will
be in session five days and will
take the place of the four-week
Normal Institute, which was
held annually in Meade. Former
ly only morning sessions were
held, but with the Professional
Institute comes a slight change
in the program, and this year
there will be both a morning and
an afternoon session, with com
petent instructors in charge of
each.
H. W. Nutt, principal of the
Oread Training School of Law
rence; J. H. Clement, superin
tendent of the Dodge City
schools, and Miss Isabelle Bruce,
formerly instructor of music in
the Meade school, have been em
ployed to take charge of the In
stitute. The program consists of lec
tures and discussions of the sub
jects in which every teacher in
the county should be interested.
A number of lectures have also
been arranged for the evening,
and these as well as those given
in the morning and afternoon,
will be of interest to the teach
ers. .
The public will be welcome at
any and all sessions of the Insti
tute.
Sometime between the hours
of 11:00 p. m. Sunday and 1:30
a. m. Monday, the restaurant of
Edgar Layton was broken into,
and a number -of valuable arti
cles taken. The thief entered by
wav of the back window, from
which he.' or they, tore the
screen and unlocked it. A watch,
two diamond rines. seven $2.50
trold nieces (taken from watch
charms) , 250 pennies and a pearl
handle .62 Colts revolver were
taken. The remarkable thing is
that the cash register was lelt
open and about eight dollars in
it not taken. The visitors went
out the back door, and left it op
en. The punch board, from which
the gold pieces were taken, and
the can in which the pennies
were kent. were found outside
the back door. No clue has been
found as to who the thief, or
thieves were.
Mistaken Idea
Nearly everyone believes that
children of the country are
stronger and healthier than
those of the citv. No belief is
more widely reverenced than
that. .
But the government says it is
not so. The United States Pub
lic Health Service denies it. Dr.
Ezra Kimball Snracrue. who has
been with that service twenty
years, writes as follows:
"Country children are physic
ally inferior to those reared in
our cities. Investigation shows
that children in rural districts
suffer decidedly more frequently
from "malnutrition, diseases of
the lungs, heart, eyes, ears, and
from adenoids, than do city chil
dren." What is the cause of it 7 Lis
ten again to Doctor Sprague:
"Many of those defects are at
tn'hnrnhle to insanitary sur
roundings in the little red school
house.
Another suDerstition gone.
Tbp maioritv of us believed that
the little red school house turned
out our sturdiest young man
hood and womanhood, and that
without, the stream of rich red
blood that poured steadily into
the cities from the country, the
city population would soon die
out. Doctor Sprague points out
that the little red school house,
with its poor heating, draughts,
bad ventilation, wrong seating
nrranepmpnts. bad lichtintr and
other defects, is responsible for
many ruined lives. ,
Inasmuch as the children in
the rural districts soon will be in
school again, the report of Dr.
Sprague is timely, rue country
schools should at least be made
minitarv before the children are
shut up in them for another win-
ier. uuws iiiy mie.
CHAUTAUQUA
MAKES A HIT
Bigger And Better Next Year
Citizens Behind Move
Meade's first and therefore
most successful Chautauqua, is
over and has become past his
tory.
The opening date was August
161b, and from then until tbe
close all moved in perfect har
mony, save tbe wind and tbe
dust. Tbe programs were well
selected and with perhaps one
exception, entirely satisfactory.
Tbe Chautauqua managers co
operated with tbe local manag
ers in making it a success.
The local people in charge are
worthy of muoh credit. Rev.
Mr. Lytle, assisted by Messrs
Gibbons, Curl, Amphlett, and a
score of others worked early
and late it order to make it a
success. Fowler, Plains, and
those from tbe country surrouod
ing'Meade come in for a sbare in
tbe successful outcome
The question of finance was
settled before the Chautauqua
was half over, Next year we
will have a bigger and better
entertainment. Already nearly
one hundred of our citizens have )
pledged tteir support,
The Meade County Fair
Now that the chautauqua is
over, we must next turn our at
tention to the Meade County'
Fair, which' will begin' Septem
ber 5th, and will last four days,
the outcome of the chautauqua
is a good example of what united
effort will do, and if we all take
hold of the fair with the same
determined will, it will be the
best in the history of the county.
The management is already busy
but they cannot do the work and
the boosting to a satisfactory
termination, unless they have '
the co-operation of every inter
ested citizen in the county.
Meade county has some of the '
finest stock, we believe we are
safe in saying, in the United
States. Poultry, too, within the
past several years has taken a
front seat, and these, together
with our farm products, if prop
erly exhibited, will make a
showing well worth seeing. In
addition to the exhibits, some
good attractions have been se
cured, and of course the usual
line of concessions will also be
on the grounds. It will be four
days of enjoyment, education
and fun. Plan, to come. If you
can't, see that your wife and the
children do, or if for any reason
you can't all come all the time,
some of you part of the time.
There ought to be a representa
tive of every family in the coun
ty at the fair every day. The
price of season tickets has been
placed at a price that is easily
within the reach of all. This is
your fair just as much as it is .
your neighbor's, and to be a suc
cess in the fullest measure, you
must do your share. If you have
anything to exhibit have it
ready to enter the .first day. ,
Meade county's biggest and best
fair begins September 5th. Be
ready to be here.
"We never miss the water un
til the well runs dry," so it is
said, and so it is with the ice as
well we never miss it until the
supply is exhausted. Such was
the case from Saturday of last
week until Thursday of this. It
seems that none was to had at
any price. An ice famine will be
unknown in Meade, we hope,
when our own ice plant is ready
for work.
Everyone must have the cash
in hand to get school books at
the M. & M. Drug Co.
