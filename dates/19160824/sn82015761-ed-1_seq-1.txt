heihad another guess eomiog- Mr.
William Beeson of 'fiSagstaff is a

dacytfor the republican, nomination
for 'tfce treasnoer's office but his
: hat is ji n the ritg now nnd he will
do what he can to secure the.ncmi
inationsand the Sice.
Mr. 'Eeeson was at one time a
iresident of Williams and is prob
ably retiembered by ro,ny YtI
Iliams people. Mr. iBeeson is now
engaged en business in iFlagstatf
and as a business man he ba
proved :a decided -success. His
business -experience ifits him to,
handle the duties of She treasurer's
offiee with -skill and ibis business
integrity is a guarantiee ;tbat he
would give sthe people a square
deal a& custodian of the public
funds. Mr. Beeson is a yourg
man full of energy and pfiuck aatd,
if elected to the office he seeks, he
should make an excellent record.
Case Of Misplaced Confidence
As Mr. W. M. Hughes and
family were riding on the Ash
Fork road near MeLellan last Sun
day, they met an auto with a flat
tire. Mr. Hughes wishing to help
the owner put of his trouble offered
to inflate his flat tine and finally
loaned him a new tube to replace
a punctured tube. His offer was
' accepted and the man was sent on
bis way with the . promise that he
would leave the borrowed tube at
one of the Williams' garages. On
his return to town Mr. .Hughes
inquired for bis tube but found
that while the man had called at
one of the garages he did not leave
a tubp. Sheriff Dickinson was
called at Flagstaff, the automobile
was found and the owner was
forced to take out the borrowed
tube and deputy sheriff Bony
Smith restored it to its owner.
The poor skunk who betrayed the
confidence which one man should
safely impose in his fellow was to
cent hia way without prosecution.

SHERIFF DICKINSON
SEEKS REELECTION
W. G. Dickinson present incum
bent of the Sheriff's office has
authorized the News to announce
his candidacy for reelection which
the News does cheerfully and with
equal cheerfulness tells News read
ers something ot the record which
Mr.. Dickinson has made as a pub-
tlie Official.
W. G. Dickinson is now serving
bis first term as sheriff of Coconino
county. Pjrobably no sheriff of
(this county has ever made a record
lor efficiency equaling that of Mr.
Dickinson's. His activity in
securing the evidence which con-
Tioted the Azbill brothers stamps
him as a man of untiring energy
in fulfilling the duties of his office
and also as a man possessing a
mind capable of logical deduction
expected only- of a Sherlock
Holmes. Sheriff Dickinson had
very little to start with in forging
the chain of evidence which con
victed the Azbills. Link by link
the evidence was gathered until
the chain was complete. Except
for this skillful handling of this
case by the sheriff, ' these black
hearted men would now be free to
commit other crimes.
The usual duties of the sheriff's
office are attended to with the
same faithfulness and energy
which sheriff Dickinson bestows on
the exceptional, ' and should the
republicans decide to have no can
didate for the sheriff's office, it
will be a merited tribute . to his
'excellence as a-publieofBoiaL---'-
It is hardly probable, however,
that, the republicans of Coconino
county will fail to put a man- on
their, ticket s a candidate for sher
iff this presidential year. We
may expect to see a complete
republican aunty ticket in the
field and the News will doubtless
be authorised Ao announce the can
didacy of .a republican -for: j,this
office verv soon.

Woman's Auxiliary Meeting
Mrs. Dixon, wife of the Rev. W.
J. Dixon of Tucson, who was le
eently eiaosen President of the Ari
zona Branch of the Woman's Aux
iliary, has arranged to visit Wil
liams next Tuesday, Aug. 29 She
wishes to meet all the ladies here
who are interested in this work,
and to address them. The meeting
will be at . St John's Rectory, at
2:30; all who are interested are
cordially invited and urged to
come. The regular Tuesdny after
noon meeting of the Surgical Dress
ings Committee will be omitted
that day, so as not to conflict with
this meeting. .
A Register for Mt. Bill
It has been suggested to the
Forest Service that a Register be
installed in the Lookout on Mt.
Bill Williams. The matter is un
der advisement aud the Register
will probably be installed. It
would give a chance to leave name
and address without scarring the
trees. Indeed, lovers names might
be inscribed on its pages linked
with a heart. ' -
RED LAKE BARBECUE
LARGEST CROWD EVER, 2000 FED
Visitors Flock to Barbecue From Four Quarters Dinner
a Great Success Many State and County Candidates
Present and All Orate Games and Sports Entertain
and Delight. : :
Everybody quit work last Thurs
day and took a day off to attend
the Red. Laka barbecue and no
body regretted it. It was ' a , great
day. Red Lake people sent word
far and wide and people came
flocking in from Williams, the
Grand Canyon, Flagstaff, Ash
Fork, Seligman, Prescott, Phoenix
and even from far distant Tucson.
Every sort of conveyance was used
t.i get there, from railway coach to
to burro, back. The day and the
crowd fnrnished an opportunity
for the office seeker to meet a great
many voters and give them the
glad hand and they sure took
vantage of it. Many Eaw sure
ough election as a result.
As far as could be seen by
ad-en-
the
guests of
Dake is a
Red Lake people. Red
pure etymological fab-
I rication.
There aint no such
thing." But had there been it
would have served merely as a
distraction and wovld better have
been absent. There was a grove
and such a grove. The groves of
history, real, or fabled, bad nothing
on ' the grove which ' Red Lake
people claim as their own. An
aggregation of stately pines in the
center of a large prairie girt ; by
mountains of greater or less degree
made a picture to satisfy the de
mand oi the most exacting m
poetry and romance. . What scenes
of love and tragedy may not have
been enacted midst the whispering
pines of -;Red . Lake grove? What
deeds of valor may not have been
inspired by the encircling moun
tains? These imposing sentinels
looked down upon pigmy man
and awed him into a state of hu
mility. Each of the speakers of
the day disclaimed' being an orator
while giving tribute to. the oratory
of his predecessor. Each in his
turn, however; waxed eloquent and
belied Lis humble asseveration.
The visitors at the barbecue
could be accounted for but whence
came Red Lake people. In that
whole valley there was not a hab
itation, as far as eye could see.
Whence came those hospitable
people who insisted on their rights
as hosts and, virtually, compelled
all to partake unsparingly ..of their
bounty. They were not myths for
they are known to man but dots
any man know their place of habi
tation? The question is not pert
inent to this story and it may well
be left unanswered.
The Candidates Hour
At 11:00 a. m. when th speak
ers were advertised to begin their
part of the program an expectant
crowd of more than a thousand was
on the ground. The chairman of
the day, JI. D. Boulin, a Red Lake
man of very certain corporeality,
announced that the speaking would
begin and then introduced Geo. W.
P. Hunt, ' . . Arizona's governor.
Governor Hunt, like Mark Antony,
is not an orator, but; his lack of
oratorical accomplishments did not
dampen the ardor of his political
friends who hold that less oratory
and more work is a very good slogan
for this campaign.
Governor Hunt was followed by
Hon. Tom Campbell, the porbable
republican candidate for governor:
Mr. Campbell disclaimed oratorical J
powers but professed to have been
moved by governor Hunt's elo
quence. Maybe he was sincere.
One should remember, tho, that
the age-old mountains were listen
DRAWS
ing and exacting a courtesy of
speech which would not be yielded
to other surroundings. Be that as
it may, Hon. Tom has a good voice
and easy manner and one would
expect that when warmed by : an
appreciative audience he would ex
press himself in language of im
agery and with eloquence.
Geo. A. Olney was then called
for but he had not arrived. Later
he was heard from as a successful
competitir at the "ringing . the
duck" booth, taking a duck by. a
successful cast of the ring. ; This
feat of the candidate for the gov
ernorship could well inspire his
political friends .with confidence
that he is a man on whom fortune
smiles and that good luck : will at
tend him at the September prima
ries ancTat the November election.
Judge J. H. Kibby, republican
candidate for United States Sena
tor ' next appeared- on the fplat
form. . Judge Kibbey was not only
modest, disclaiming oratorical gifts,
but also, frank. Heis a candidate
because he .wants the . office. -No
ciaptrap aooui wanung io . serve,
the people and help in .beneficial
. . . . -v - - - - - - -
lesnsiauon. une. reaiiv. iiK.es an
assurance from a candidate that
he has at least a modicum of pub
lic spirit and is not tninking of
self alone, but there need be no
illusions about Judge Kibbey. tie
wants the office. That's the mo
tiveof'bis "campaign. T.v ,
Judge Kibbey " was "followed by
Wiley Jones, Attorney General
of Arizona. Mr. Jones easily made
Probably "he ought to have done so,
being in constant practice as the
state's prosecutor.' ' Mr.. . Jones ap-
npnlfirl tni the -women to ' fit them
selves for the 'suffrage which they'
now eniov so that thev ' mav - vote
osopher will probably reflect that
it will be easy for the women to
prepare themselves to vote as in-
.telligently as their brothers have
been voting and will vote this fall.
But the cynical philosopher must
not be listened to 'should he at
tempt to voice his reflections. He
is an undesirable citizen.
Judge Frank Dnffy of Nogales
was called onto the platform next
and he came with apparent reluct
ance. He stated that he is a can
didate fot the democratic nomina
tion for jus"? e .of the supreme
court. He pledged" himself to en
force the. laws at all tim?. ii elected
to the supreme bench. '
The last of the political speakers
was Frank E. Curley of Tucson.
Mr. Curley is determined to wrest
the democratic nomination from'
Wiley Jones. He is a compara
tively new man in the political
field. He is a man of good address
and an easy talker. . i ,"
Prohibition Advocated '
The political 'speakers were, fol-
lowed by Grady Gammage who
spoke for the proposed prohibition
amendment to the Arizona consti-
x i -- .- -r
tion amendment. Mr. Gammage ;
claimed to have smelled the friends
of the local option amendment on
the grounds and asked thm to
come forward and represent their '
cause on the platform. They seem
ed to be content with appealing to
the sense of smell as none responded
