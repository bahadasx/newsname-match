"Americans own more than nine

"Mexicans own less than one-third the

ROACH A THOROUGHBRED.
. KELLY POOL, in the Centralia
Cburier, referring to Secretary of
State Cornelius Roach, one of the de
feated candidates for the Democrat
ic nomination for Governor, says:
1 "Cornelius Roach is a thorough-
1 hrcd. No living man was ever given
I rawer deal than Roach got whip
i awed, double-crossed, flim-flammed
1,d jockeyed to defeat yet he
tomes up smiling like the Prince of
America that he Is. There are no

I km snd our motives cannot be
I quMtimcd, we want to say that Cor-
ittlim Roach is one of the fairest
. sswt men we have ever known in
i puMl'c life. He is faithful, efficient,
toncsc, irutniui, acpenaaoie, cunsci-
entious and everything else a real
nan could be. And another thing-
he knows the meaning of gratitude
and never forgets a kindness shown
him and that's the rarest virtue in
the kingdom of politics."
WHENEVER it comes to consis
ted giving and cordial work for any
enterprise for the growth and pros
perity of Mexico, you can always find
Sam Morris "on the job." Because
Sam always gives and works for every
worthy enterprise, he is one of the
best solicitors for public funds tho
town has ever had. No matter wheth
er he is directly interested in the en
terprise or not, he never knocks it, but
always assists, and for that reason
people who are in the habit of givinj
toward public enterprises are always
glad to have Sam call on them. That's
the kind of public spirited men that
help make a greater city.

CLARK PAYS OWN EXPENSES
Sends Back Money Advanced
Campaign Trip to Maine.
for
NEW YORK, August 23. Spea
ker Champ Clark, of the House of
Representatives, yesterday returned
to headquarters the money advancd
to him for expenses in opening th
Democratic campaign in Maine last
week. Clark, in a letter explained
that the payment of his own expensis
for speech-making constitutes thi
only way he can legally contribute to
the cause, and that he had never yec
accepted a-cent of : expense money
from the National Democratic ComJ
mittces.
He added that, as a candidate for
re-election, the laws of Missouri pro
hibit him from expending more than
$600 as a campaign fund, and he
needed that amount for his own cam
paign.

her? last Saturday went unanimously
on record in favor of constitutional
convention for Missouri.
In his address Dr. Loeb pointed out
that the constitution of. this itate
must be revised rather than amend
ed, for there have been seventy-four
amendments proposed for the consti
tution, thirty-nine of which were pro
posed at the last four elections.
While our federal constitution has
only 4,000 wordB, our present state
constitution has almost 40,000. When
our state constitution was adopted
there were no trolley lines, no electric
lights and few of the other things
which today require legislative con
trol or supervision. Then there was
no problem of the city to be dealt
with.
Then Dr. Loeb pointed out the
hardships worked on the county
Bcchools by our present constitution.
The rural school boards may levy
40c on the 1 100 valuation for schools
and the city board may levy as high
as 65c. The voters in the rural dis
tricts may vote on 65c for schools,
while those in the city may vote one
dollar for their schools.
Another meeting of the county
school board members is being plann
ed for next month. Although only
two members of each board are re

Judge Williams came to Mexico
from Kentucky in 1856. He was
born in Nicholas county, Ky. He

out the war with General Price's
army.
He served four years as county Re

into the splendid Audrain of today.
He was popular with everyone and
famed for his inimitable ability to tell

LIFE IN COLORADO SPRINGS
-42-
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Au
gust 19. Dear Mitchell: I see by
the papers that good old Audrain is I ttnese do.
anwd f.v' n..w u n.1 that I
everyone is happy. Well, you haven t
got anything on Colorado Springs for
we are getting some rain, too. And
most everyone is happy unless it's
the tourists.
But if the rain makes corn grow in
Missouri and elsewhere it cer
tainly stimulates tha tourists of the
country. That's why Colorado
Springs natives are happy. This vil
lage certainly is full of them. They
come from everywhere and Kan
sas, too.
The other day a friend of mine (no,
was a boy( and I were walking
down the street and spied a Colum
bia, Mo., pennant. Of course, I rush
ed out and waved at the driver. But
he gave me the "once over" and open,
ed up the "juice or whatever you
do to make an auto go faster Bnd
oroceeded to break the speed lim
its of this Western village.
So there's one Missourian who
missed out on answering a lot of
questions. He must have known me
and saw me coming.
And speaking of tourists every
other car you meet in Colorado
Springs has an Oklahoma flag on it.
Those Oklahomans are so thick out
here that many enterprising mer
chants have had OKLAHOMA STORE
printed over the tops of their win
dows so tho Indian Hunters will feel
at home. It's a fine trade drawing
stunt
I'm rooming with a lad here
Cornell University man who has
new Dodge touring car and,
course we find it "necessary" to make
a good many trips to the mountains
and other points of interest out here.
In order ot be popular, and to get
our share of the load which is
clearly defined by the laws of the
State of Colorado we, too, fly a big
Oklahoma pennant
But back of that question of rain
here in the Springs. The guide book
DO SAY that less than 15 inches an
nually will cover the rainfall. You
mention that to someone who happens
to live here and he will tell you that
this is the "rainingest" season he has
ever seen here in his life.
All perfectly respectful citizens
who inhabit widely advertised sum
mer and winter resorts pull that same
stunt on the visitor.' I've even been
here so lone that should you call
on me some beautiful summer af
ternoon, and the usual afternoon
shower would start, I would begin at
once to explain that this was "very
unusual, indeed." It's kind of a dis
ease, I think. It's catching just like
"golfitis."
Anyhow it's a fine place to spend
the summer and when I get your dai
ly Letter in the form of the Evening
Ledger and read where Mr. Lllewell-
yn says positively the thermometer
has done 98 or better, I just sit down
and laugh.
And that night when you are try.
ing to drink all of Charlie Buckner'
"cokes" to keep cool, I'm snoozing
under two double blankets.
But at that just give me Old
Missouri. Sincerely,
J. Harrison Brown,
That the apparent belief on the
part of a great many Americans that
a war between the United States and
Japan will come soon is a remote pos
sibility; that Japan is not keeping
vigil npon the United States so much
as upon th novements of China and
that the Japanese are a versatile and
progressive people, is the optr.on ex
pressed by Prof. F. L. Martin, of the
School of Journali.im, who rs'-urnod
Tuesday with nis family from a stay
in Japan tint lasieo over a period
of fifteen months, suya the VnVErsity
Missourian.
"Do you think that the Japs arc
watching the movements of this coun
try and that they are thinking of
making war upon us at some time af
ter the European struggle is over?"
Professor Martin was asked.,
"I do not," he stated. "There
seems to be a feeling among a great
many people here that the Japanese
are standing ready to grab at the
throat of the United States but I
think there never was an idea so mis
taken as that During my stay in To-
kio not once have I heard a word of
ill feeling expressed against the peo
ple here. On the other hand, how
ever, the Japanese are paying a great
deal of attention to what the Chinese
are accomplishing and they are think
ing a great deal as to just what part
the Japanese will play in the future
political status of that country.
"Now, the only thing that I can
think of that would prompt a war be
tween the United States Bnd Japan
would be for us to interfere in the
case of Japanese intervention in Chi
na, but I cannot imagine our soldiers
getting down in the trenches for the
sake of the yellow men. I think the
whole trouble lies in the fact that the
Japanest have us bluffed. When a

Schemes Gigantic Operation. ,
It is shown by the official inquiry
that about $200,000 worth of stock m
the International Automobile League
Tirs company have been sold through- j
out the country on representations
that stockholders would be able to
buy their tires from the company at
factory cost and would receive enor
mous dividends because of the market
provided by the league's membership.
Not only was the number of league
members greatly exaggerated in the
representations made to sell this
stock, but evidence also showed that
the tire company had never built nor
opened a factory nor done business
of any kind since its organization in
the State of California in 1912. The
inquiry developed what the official
fraud order characterizes as, "illegal
and unconscionable" charges to the
extent of more than $200,000 placed
against the tire company by its pres
ident Bidwell.
In addition to the action against
him taken by the postal authorities,
Bidwell was indicted by the federal
grand jury at Rochester, N. Y-, charg

what is left is all of the finest The
harvest is just commencing around
here now and lots of men in the coun
try, but still there will not be enough
men for the harvest. The wheat runt
from 30 to 60 bushels per acre.. Near,
ly all of the land in this vicinity is
pretty hilly, but they farm the hills
just the same as level land, and get
just as much grain from them.
The weather has been ideal since we
arrived. The only thing is we can
hardly get enough sleep. It is just
nice and warm in the day time, but the
nights are all real chilly, which makes
sleeping a pleasure, after suffering
like we do during the summer in the
east.
We think we will start back home in
about a week. We leave here tomor
row for Butte and will visit a j few
days there, then back to old Missouri
again. Yours truly,
C. J. Fant
Mayor Crockett Harrison, of Fui-
ton, brother of Mayor J. F. Harrison,
of this city, and three councilmen of
tho Capital of the Kingdom G. G,
Terry, J. A. Martin, J. B. Sharp wero
all in the city holdover here this week.
It was on a tour of inspection, how-
ever, and for no infraction of the law,
that they entered our cage of cor
rection.
They made a similar visit to Colum
bia. In speaking of their trip Mayor
Harrison stated to a reporter of the
Columbia University Missourian:
"Fulton is a law-abiding town,
but occasionally they bring them in
from other towns, and we must pro
vide for the safety of our citizens.
We intend to build a new hold-over at
once, and on our tour, we have yet to
find a town that is proud of its
"cooler." Columbia is ahead of many
places, and the recent improvement in
the shape of the shower-bath is much
needed." i
PREDICTS GREAT TEAM.
Jim Tom Edmonston, of this city,
who has been in Omaha all summer,
has returned home for a few weeks'
visit before returning to college at
Central in Fayette. Mr. Edmonstoi
is one of the star football men of the
Eagles and says the prospects for a
great eleven there this year were nev
er surpassed.
Almost all of last year's team will
return and the squad will bo aug
mented by a number of new men who
made splendid records jn small teams
last year. The Central-Westminster
game Thanksgiving will be played in
Fayette this year. A special from
Fulton will carry many from Mexico
to this match. The Blue Jays claim a
stronger line-up then ever and the
match promises to be even a greater
drawing card than last year.
SEED WHEAT!
Be sure to have your wheat ro-
cleaned before sowing. It will pay
you big returns. WM. POLLOCK

(Moberly Monitor.)
The rumor that the Burlington con
templates building a road througn
Randolph county, was revived this
morning when a visitor to Moberly re
ported that at Wilcox, a coaling sta
tion for the "Katy" below Elliott, 80
cars loaded with steel rails consigned
to the Burlington have been standing
for more than two weeks. It is known
that the Burlington in the past two
or three years has done a largo
amount of surveying south of Elliott
and their grade stakes show that the
line, if built will run in the vicinity
of Wilcox. The Burlington also has
spent considerable time surveying
east of Moberly. While no one can
learn the plans of tha road, It looks
as though soma mova was contemplat
ed by the road In the near future, elsa
there wouldn't be thirty cars of steel
rails on the siding at the Wilcox coal
ing station.
H. P. Averitt has sold his home at
the southwest corner of Waddingham

MEXICO WOULD SUFFER
FROM RAILROAD STRIKE
A general tie-up of the railroads
such as is threatened by the railroad
strike would stop trains that are
bringing a large percentage of the
food supply to Mexico. To say noth
ing of the inconvenience which woulJ
be caused to traveling men and to busi
ness in general a large amount of the
food supplies of the towns and cities
would be cut off and everyone would
suffer to a greater or less extent
"Were the railway communication
cut off, the supply of most edibles
would not last last more than three
days," said Ross Wagner, of the local ,
branch of the Haas-Lieber Grocery
Company, in speaking of the railroad
strike Thursday morning.
According to the figures of this
company it takes about 300 packages
of fruits, such as lemons, oranges, ba
nanas, and other fresh fruits, one car
of granulated sugar, 500 cases of
canned goods, one car of salt, 200 cas
es of syrup, 300 boxes of soap, snd
50 boxes of cheese to supply the peo
ple of Mexico for one week.
According to Mexico meat dealers
the supply of fresh meat on hand at
the meat markets at the present time
is sufficient to last the city only about
two days.
Henry M. Eversole, lawyer of
Fulton, was Mexico visitor Monday.
