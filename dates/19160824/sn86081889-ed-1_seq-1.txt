BriJge Contract Let
On Tuesday of this week, the
Commissioners of . Huntingdon
and Fulton Counties met at Dub
lin Mills and let the contract for
the new concrete bridge at that
Place. The successful biddef was
R. R. Myers, of Lewistown,
whose bid was $3496 for a bridge
72 feet in the clear. This bid
was made on the supposition that
a four-foot excavation would be
sufficient depth. If, after the
foundation is excavated, solid
ground ha3 not been reached, the
County will probably have to pay
a few dollars for the extra work.
But the price named is about
what the total cost wfll be.

Letter from the Front.
Dear Editor, Parents and my
Friends: Presuming that some
of the people might desire to
know something of what is going
on along the border, this after
noon, I will pen a few lines to
the Editor.
In the first place, I wish to
correct all mistakes in regards to
my illness. My right shoe rub
bed my foot from which local
blood poison set in, but in a few
days all was well, and now I am
as well a3 prior to leaving home.
Everything seems quiet along
the border and there is no rea
son for us to think we can parti
cipate in any trouble. I do not
think our stay here will last long
er than the middle of September.
But we have had good training.
Last night I saw one of the
most beautiful sights that I have
ever seen, lijtwcen half past
seven and eight o'clock we had our
first rain since arriving here, and
it sure was some electrical storm.
About the time it was over the
moon came out and behold ! I
3aw one of the most beautiful
rainbows that ever eyes were
laid upon! It was between us
and the mountain and the reflec
tion cast upon the mountain is
one long to be remembered by all
who had the pleasure of witness
ing it.
We have several kinds of cac
tus here, and some of them are
now in bloom, I think there are
six kinds.
The horned toad is something
that we have a great deal of
sport with, for they are so harm-
ess. Not wishing to take too
much of the space in your paper
i will close. With best regards
to all in Fulton County.
Sincerely I remain,
John C. Bishop, Co. C. S Inft. 3

Paso, Texas.
Struck by Auto.
On Wednesday morning of last
week, Mrs. Jesse B. Snyder, of
Thompson township was struck
by an automobile in Washington
City with the result that her left
wrist was fractured. Her daugh
ter, Miss Anna M. Snyder, lives
in Lancaster, Pa. Miss Anna,
intending to spend a two-weeks'
vacation in the home of her pa
rents, near Plum Run, wrote for
her mother to meet her in Wash
ington and spend a few days
sight-seeing. Mrs. Snyder went
to Washington, and on Wednes
day morning she and her daugh
ter were on their way down to
the wharf to take a boat for a
trip down to Mount Vernon, when
an automobile owned and operat
ed by George Rohrer of Hagers-
town skidded on account of the
wet condition of the street (it
was raining) and shot into the
two ladies. Miss Anna was not
seriously injured, but her mother
had to be taken to the hospital
for surgical treatment.
- More Sheep Profits.
Walker Mellott, near Needmore
writes to say that he is the own
er of the remaining fifteen sheep
of the flock from which David A.
Nelson purchased his five ewes
that netted him such handsome
profits this summer, ' and men
tioned in last week's News. Mr.
Mellott from his flock of 15, sold
wool $19.98, sheep, $1G8.G2, a to
tal of $218 60 this year and has
one more ewe than at the start.
This is the finest bunch of sheep
in the neighborhood. On what
can you make more profit?
Tossed by Car.
One day last week, while Dr.
and Mrs. R. B. Campbell, of New
Grenada, were driving nearHus-
tontown, the engine stopped
while going up a hill. Mis.
Campbell got out of the machine
and walked to the rear of the
car at the moment the car started
backward down hill. She was
caught by a fender and tossed to
the side of the road. Her face
came in contact wjth some rub
bish and one of her lips was cut
through.
Former Fultoa Lawyer. '
Among the many interesting
visitors to McCon'nellsburg this
summer were Hon. and Mrs. Jo
nathan Boone Cessna, of Erie
Pa., who spont Monday night
and part of Tuesday at the Ful
ton House. Mr. Cessna practic
ed law in McConnellsburg during
the latter part of the sixties; liv
ed in Bedford until 1881, went to
Hastings, Nebr., where he prac
ticed twenty years, being con
nected with the trial of many im
portant cases in the Middle West
and Southwest. . In 1904 he mov
ed to Erie, the forrnor home of
his wife, and has resided in that
city since that time.
Mr. Cessna and Judge Walling
of Erie are close friends, and Mr
Cessna is a very enthusiastic sup
porter of Judgu Walling for the
Supreme Bench, and Rr.ys that
Fulton County voters will make
no mistake in giving Judge Wall
ing their support at the election
in November.
Mr. Cessna noted with much
gratification the rapid strides to
ward improvement thv.t McCon
nellsburg has made in the last
two-score of years, in fact the
Duffield (Dickson) building, and
the Dr. Trout Corner were abou'
the only two buildings on the
main street that looked familiar.
What was of interest most of all
wa3 the building of our railroad.
Until he saw the steam shovel
throwing dirt on the east side of
Tuscarora mountain, he was in
clined to think the matter a great
joke. He said he well recalled
one of Bob Burdette's smart say
ings when that famous lecturer
gave his "Rise and Fall of aMus
tache" in our Court House many
years ago. lioo wa3 exhorting
parents to be careful not to dis
courage their sons, but upon ev
ery occasion to encourage every
thing that seemed worthy of
their ambition. "Why," said
Bob. in a burst of animation, "if
one of your boys should come
bouncing into your presence some
morning and say, 'Papa, I'm go
ing to build a railroad to the
moon,' don't frown; slap him on
the back and say, 'Go ahead' my
son; if you succeed in getting a
road to McConnellsburg, you'll
have no trouble completing it to
the moon., "
If Bob were living-now, he
would not attempt to spring that
joke on a McConnellsburg audi
ence. Mr. Cessna and his brother
William, of Rainsburg, are the
only direct descendants of Peter
and Christina Hess Morgart, and
at the Morgart reunion held at
Providence Grove in Bedford
county on the 12th inst, Mr.
Cessna made an address in which
he reviewed the history of the
Morgart family and gave much
genealogical information.
Koualain-Top Picnics.
It has become quite a fad to
take ycur visiting friends to Tus
carora Heights instead of making
house parties for them during
this hot weather So many par
ties of this kind have been held
up there during the past ten days
that we have not been able to
keep track of all. It is a delight
ful novelty to meet friends in
that manner.
NnuglisMeuujr.

week, Mr. G. C. Naugle, and

A Merry Wedding.
Last Friday evening, out on
Andrew Washabaugh's big front
porch, in the presence of about
one hundred witnesses, Pierce
Henry and "Miss" Willis Daniels
were tied together in a hard knot
by Pete Morton to the accom
paniment of the "Song of the
Bull Frogs" .rendered by Fred
Fisher on an instrument of few
strings. The flower girls were
Lloyd Mellott and John Cooper,
In their hurry to get married
they forgot to have a bride's maid
and a best man. The bride was
attired in the stylo of fifty year3
ago, over which she wore some
thing that was black and all fuss
ed up. She wa3 of very com
manding appearance and was
half again as tall a3 her little
sawed-off spouse. Fact is they
were married under the assumed
names of Miss Big and Mr. Lit
tie. Many murmurs of sympa
thy for the future welfare of the
groom were heard after the
crowd had gotten a good view of
the bride's proportions. Then,
too, she was as ugly as sin, and
when an attempt to raise reve
nue by selling kisse3 was propos
ed, not a man in the crowd ever
thought them worth the nickel
asked, and she remained unkiss
ed. She had enough flour on her
face to make a flapjack.
Miss Sophia Hohman, at the
head of her Sunday School class
assisted by Miss Olive Pittman,
gave the "show," and the class
treasury was enriched nearly
nine dollars by the sale of cake
and lemonade kindly donated by
friends. The splendid Washa
baugh home was freely" thrown
open for the reception of the
wedding party, and scores of
happy faces present indicated
their appreciation of the occasion.
Let's have another.
Clevenger Bess.
Mr. Edwin S. Clevenger, and
Miss Olive P. Hess were married
in Pittsburgh, on August 17, 1916

Clevenger left on a wedding trip
to New York, Bermuda Islands,
&c, and will be guest3 for a few
days at the former home of the

Clevenger is a son of the . late
Hiram Clevenger, of Taylor town
ship, and the bride is a native of
Pittsburgh. Mr. Clevenger has
lived in Pittsburgh for several
years, and after October loth
they will be at home to friends
at 59G0 Baum Street, Pittsburgh.
Mr. and Mrs. Clevenger may al
ways be sure of a hearty welcome
in many Fultoy county homes
when they feel the need of our
mountain air to clear the Smoky
City atmosphere from their lungs
Early Morning Wedding.
Charles Calvin Heck and Miss
Glenna May Price accompanied
by the groom's father and other
friends, all of Orbisonia, "autoed
to Ilagerstown last Saturday
morning and were married by the
Rev. E. K. Thomas. The party
then came to McConnellsburg in
time for breakfast shortly after
6 o'clock. If these young people
carry the "get-there-early" spir
it through life, they certainly
will be successful. We wish them
happiness. The groom is a son
of Mr. and Mrs. J. F. Heck, and
the bride is a daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. S. G. Price-all cf Or
bisonia.
KerIin-Naugle.

Thigh Broken.
Last Friday evening, as Scott
Alexander's auto truck was com
ing to town from the ice house
up on the Mercersburg Pike,
Bruce Souders attempted to climb
oif the truck while it was moving
slowly. Losing his hold the boy
fell under the wheels of the
heavily loaded machine with the
result that his left thigh was
broken half way between the
knee and hip. In addition to the
fracture, large patches of skin
were rubbed off his leg, and he
seems to suffer more from these
abrasions than from the broken
bone. Dr. Robinson, assisted by
Dr. Mosser, reduced the fracture.
Bruce is a .son of Mr. and Mrs.
George Souders, east of town.
