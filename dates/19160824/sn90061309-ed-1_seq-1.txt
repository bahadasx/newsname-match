At Rest
Miss Mae Hawkins died at the
home of her mother, Saturday,
August 19, at 1045 p. m. She
had enjo.ed unusually good health
during her life until last April, i
when she was ill, in fact, she was !
never well after that and for the
past eight weeks she suffered in-
tensely. A number of physicians
were consulted but she was beyond
human aid. Everything that loving
hands could do was done to alle
viate her pain.
May Huwkins was born Decern
berl3, 1878 on a farm near War
ren, purchased by her grandfather,
Mark Hawkins, in 1845 She was
the only daughter of Lewis and
Orinda Cooper Hawkins. She was
named for her god-mother, Mrs.
May Scheetz Purnell and was con
firmed by Rev. Frederick Scheetz
iu St. Jude's church, where she
was ever a constant member. She
was also a member of the Order of
Eastern Star at Huunewell and th'
members ot this lodge were especial
ly kind to her during her long ill
ness. Her father died in May 1905
For forty years before his death he
was clerk of the school board in
that district. His daughter assis
ted him in the work and with the
exception of the year following his
death, has HIM the position ever
since.
She will be missed by a large
circle of friends as well as by the
home circle. She leaves a mother
and four brother.-.. Mark C of this

The Rail Contention
President Wilson and his cabinet
have been hard at work to prevent
the rail strike. He has been in
conference with the representatives
of the Brother hoods and the Rail
roads Presidents and laid before
all plans which seem fair. These
plans do not give either side all for
which it asks, yet provide means
by which the difficulty may be
adjusted aud teus prevent a strike
which would not only be detri
mental to the interests of the Rail
roads and the working men, but
also to every man. woman and
child of the one hundred million
Americans.
In President Wilson America has
a president whose heart beats in
harmony with the heart of human
ity.
