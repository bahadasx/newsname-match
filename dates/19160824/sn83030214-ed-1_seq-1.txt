Aetion Over Property.
The aetion before Judge Landis grew
out of a petition to nppoint a receiver
for Morrison'a properties, which are
believed to be worth $8,000,000. lt
was contended in this that the city of
Chicngo, under the will of Morrison's
father, xvould receive, if the man died
childless, the entire property for edu

that Morrison had adopted these two

The millionaire is said to have given
away more than $2,000,000 of hia es?
tate to friends in the last seven years.

Mysterious Attack in Home
?Wife Unable to Tell
of Injuries.
Caldxxell, X. J.. Aug. 2.5. The sound
of chok.ng and whimpering woke Mrs.
Laura C. Post. of Two Rridges. N. J.,
early this morning. She listened for
a moment, then crept downstairs and
opened the front door. At the bottom
of the porch steps a woman lay. She
had been beaten terribly about the
head, and it was not until she had
been earried into the house that Mrs.
Post rccogoised her a.s a neighbor,
Mrs. Frank Miller, forty-two yearg old.
That is the half of the story upon
which the police are xvorking. What
immediately prccede.: the appearance
of the woman on the Post doorstep
no one can learn. Mrs. Miller had
gone to bed with her husband e.uly
that evening In her daSfld state she
cannot remember anything more until
.ii;.: I;, i telf in the rofltfl1 home.
Miller has disappeared. His clothes
.trll hSBg on a ehair beside the bed as
he placed them on retinng.
In the pocket.s of his trousers the
police found $100. Small change, a
uiih'h and jewelry on the bureau were
untouched. 'Ihe loose carpet on the
floi.r was not even rumple.l.
How the woman could have heen bat
tereil by a club or hlackjack until her
jaw aml her nose were broken, xvithout
arousiag the house :s a mystery to the
police. In the room next door to the
IC Mrllers occupied slopl their six
'ear-ol,l grsndson, Oliver. He was not
sroused BJ the attack on his grand
mother, who, th. poi.ee holieve, was
throxvn downstain by the man, oi men
?".icked her.
A deep cut on Mrs. Miller's sralp is
believed to have been CBBSOd by her
thrown heavily Bgsiusl the radi
Btor in the lower hall. Here, appar?
ently, she lay for sonic time, before
crawling from the house. A pool of
blood on the floor testified to this.
The woman'i nose aad Jaw were bro?

ALLIES CHECK
FOE'S ATTACKS

from Teutons Near
Strupino.
|Hy CaMe tn The Trihune 1
London, Aug. 23. The Greeks are
preparing to resist in force the ad?
vance of the Bulgarians toward BflfM
nnd Kavaia. Hefore the pressure of
Czar Ferdinand's troops the Greeks
have fallen baek, but they do not pur?
pose to permit a Kulgnrian advance to
the /Kgcan without disputing it.
Agnin the followers of Venizelos are
leading the movement to force Con?
stantine'* hand and bring about a
Greek alliance with the Kntente pow?
ers. Adhercnts of the ex-I'remicr at
Salonica are organiiing volunteers to
resist the Bulgars moving on Seres, ac
eording to a Reuter dispatch which
reached London to-night.
Thfl commander al Seres, according to
this report, has called to thc colors the
troops demobilised in aceordancfl with
the demands made by the Allies last
spring. Mis iiroclamation declares that
thfl Hiilgaiii.iis will soon be opposed.
Athenr, Skeplical of Pledge..
Thc Bulgarians are approaching
Seres, but have not entered tlie town
yet. .Sofia's envoy at A'hens has given
assurances that Bfllthfll Seres nor Ka?
vaia will be occupied by Hulganan
troops, but thc .-.'lv.iner in Mai-edunia
continues, .nd Athens ;s inclined to be
skeptical of Bulgar promises.
With the strorg agitation of thc
Yemz.'los party for participation in the
war on the side of the Allies, the
I'ulr-ar threat may prove the final lm
pulsc that flrill drive Greece into tie
war. This, too, may force detinite
action at length hy Kumania.
K forecast of what decision Bu?
charest will make and when she will
make it is unwlsr. The Allies, how?
ever, are optimistic. Several times in
the lant year Rumania was ready to
enter thc eonflict and reversed her de?
cision only because the comnlcxion of
the war had changed. Balkan baifjaiai
come high, as both sides have learned,
and th.y are never certain until they
are delivered
Bulgar Attacks Checked.
The outstan.imj* feature of the light?
ing on the SalOBiea front to-dav was
?lerking of thc Bulgar counter
otfensivf against the Allifld flanks.
Hoth the a-sault on the Struma. wherj
Banail'i aatposti arorfl drircn hack,
and west cf Lakfl OfltrOYO, on the left
wing, where the Serbs are holding the
line, have been halted.
Until this prflflflurfl on the flanks wa.
removed, a further advance along the
Nish-Sflloaica railway was impossible.
The Allied forces have stortne.l the
.southern llopflfl of 'he \'eles moun?
tains and hav,. held th.-ir gains. 'I'V?-it
i.ext thrust would rarrv with it an
element of dancer unless the me lace
to the flanks were removed.
Along the Struma thfl Bulgars have
intrenched fllong a line that paiallfllfl
the river. This move was evidentlv
'ntended to prevent any Allied move
into eastward Maredonia, where an ad?
vance up ?he Struma Vallev. along thc
railway through Pcmihassar, might
eventually thieaten SoAa.
Serbs Take Offensive.
On the extreme western wing, in th ?
Florina sector, Berlin claims an ad?
vance for thc Bulgar troops. But Paril
annnour.ces to-night that the Serlft
have made progress norfh of Strupino.
Appparentiy the offensive in this sec?
tor, too, ia being wrenched **radnally
from the ("zar Ferdinand's troops.
Military obflfllTflTI here bflieve that
?':?..? main operations in the Balkans will
takfl piao- between Poiran and Seres.
The campaign must devclop rapidly, for
autumnal rain, due in a fow we.ks, will
hinder if not bar operations entirely.

Hctwcen now and then thc humani

the lawyers and detectives assuciated
in the effort to save him from the elec?

against Krwin King, whom they be?
lieve to be the real murderer. And be?
tween this day and that, John C.
Kniekerbocker, District Attorney of
OrloBBfl CoaBty, must either complete
an alibi for King or be ready to face
a decision that a new trial for Stielow
is justnicl.
Attorneys for Stielow and for the
state found themselxes in agreement
for the lirst lime when they appeared
before Justice Adolph Rodenbcck, prc
giding over a special term of the Su?
preme Court here this morning. Roth
sides wanted time Stielow's side be?
cause the detectives have yet to bridge
several gaps before they have fully
traced the movements of King about
thc time of thc double murder. And
thc state because a formidable hatch
of Stielow affidavits had -een submitted
at the last minute.
Demands for thc appointment of a
special prosecutor had not been heeded
and it was Mr. Kniekerbocker himself
alleged by the opposing lawyers to
be unduly, if honestly, prejudiced -
who appeared for Orlcans County and
thc state.
Charges '_xchanged.
Scarcely veile.i charges of trickery

"I take the word of Mr. Knieker?

Mr. Kniekerbocker directed bifl first

VILLACRUSHED,
SAYS PERSHING
Army Will Withdraw
Soon, Is Belief in
Washington.
lKro? Th' "Trll.une li.irrau 1
Washington, Aug. 23. (Ieneral Persh?
ing's troops probably will be ordered
out of Mexieo i.i a very short time, of
Aeiala said to-day, following a report
from the general that Villa had been j
eliminated aa a serious factor in the
aituation. It is believed that when the
Mexican-Ameriean commission mcets
the retirement will be at once arranged.
Villa's "late attempt to obtain a fol?
lowing," Genera' Pershing says, "il re?
ported as almoat a total failure."
Pershing's dispatch, s;nt from the
expeditionary headquarters at (olonia
Dublan, reads:
"My last report regarding Villa at?
tack on Parral i? now rcp< rted incor-^
reet. Villa had only small following.
He avoided Parral and places occupied
by Carranza troops. He s making 1 is
way south into Durango. Probably now ,
hidinL in mountains.
"Villa's Prestigc (.one."
"L'ntil recently Villa has been hiding
since being driven to mountains of
Southen Chihuahua by our troops last
April. His late attempt to obtain a fol?
lowing is reported a? almost a total
failure. The opinion seems general that
Villa's prestige iB gone, and that he can
never again become a serious factor in
Mexican attairs."'
Secretary LansinR and Ambassador
designate Arredondo arranged to-day
that tht commission should meet the
tirst week in September, some/here on
the NflW Kngland eoaflt Secretary " ine
ar.d the tWfl new anpointees, Judge'

meet at thfl State Department next week
to receive their instru.'tions It i.s prob
able tha'w the Mexican commi. lioBflM
?HII also '>e here to confer with Mr.
Arredondj before proceeding north.
The belief flXprflflflfld by IVrshing
that Villa was no longer dangemus m
regarded by Administration supporters
as of thc greatest nnportance.
( oupled with Funston's recommenda?
tion that the forces be retired, it is
held to absolve President Wilson from
all blame if the withdrawal later
proves to have been u mistake.
Fear Kepetition of Raids.
The prineipal reason, it ifl declared,
for keeping the troops in Mexieo in
active has been the fear that if they
were w.thdrawn Villa or lus bands
might repeat the < olumbus raid and
make necessary another punitive ex?
pedition. The country, President Wil
. ri ft saiil to believe, will not dis
approve the withdrawal of the troops,
but it would resent using the army
twice to punish the same bandit.
It has been praetieally settled, there?
fore, for some time that Pershing
would be ordered home as soon as the
Admiaifltratiofl could be sure the situa?
tion would remain tram-uil without
h i rn.
Hesides the fear of another Villa
outbreak, there baa heen another rea?
son for keeping IVrshing in Mexieo.
That is that Curranrr.. has, in the eyea
of the Administration, "beh&ved" much

BROTHERHOOD DELEGATES
CHAFE UNDER DELAY
Peaee May Hinge on Ability of Executive
to Effect Bargain with Presi?
dents of Roads.
[From a Staff Correspondent of The Tribune.]
Washington, Aug. 23.?President Wilson made an earnest
'jfTort to-day to satisfy the plea of the railroads for some defi?
nite assurance that they will be recompensed by rate increases
or legislative relief from burdensome expensos if they accept
his settlement plan providing for an eight-hour day. Whether
the promises made by the President will satisfy the roads re
mains for the conferences of the next few days to determine.
Meanwhile outspoken dissatisfaction and growing impa
tience among the 640 delegates of the four brotherhoods, chaf
ing at the railroads' delay, threaten serious complications. The
Mmployes, stirred by a strong minority urging immediate ae?
tion, were held in check by their leaders to-day, but it was
elearly apparent that the leaders' task was getting harder aad
harder each day.
Whatever progress was made by the special committee
of eight railroad presidents who are considering the probU-ms
involved in the Wilson plan was kept a secret. They were in
session all ctay and again to-night.

Will the tenants of Riverside Drive
apartments to whom Frederic J. Brcn
nicr has displayed his cough asscmble
at the Tombs this morning and deter
mine whether the Mr. Brennier at pres?
ent occupying a cell in Tier 8 is he
whose botjus checks they still hold?
Mes.rs. Boyle and McGee, of the
Fourth Branch Bureau, extcnd this in?
vitation to all those prospective rent
ers of faraiahod apartment* to whom
Mr. Breaaier told the sad story of his
palatial yacht and how he fell over
board from it. Thc two detectives
have been pursuing Mr. Brennier and
his lucrative cough for the last six
weeks.
A Tenant at Last.
Im.igine yourself the tenant of s
Riverside apartment which you ardent
ly desire to rent furnish, d. Pieture
yourself after weeks of hope respond
ing to the door bell rung by a pros
pective tenant.
It's Mr. Brennier, son of Judge
Brennier, of Ulster County, you know,
a contracting engineer of great wealth
aad huskiness of voice. Mr. Brennier
ifl slim and elegant. His speech, de
spite his heavy cold, is fluent. He likes
your apartment He merely yawns
v.hcn you mention the price. "I'll write
you a check," he remarks indolently.
You like him.
The check is written and Mr. Bren?
nier walks toward the window. Be- \
ware, 0 trustful apartment owner, he
is about to cough!
"Thal is my yacht out there in the j
river," he says. "That is why I xvant
this apartment. It is near the landing
stage. I spend most of my time on
my yacht. Yes, it is quite expensive,
but I don't bother about such things. I
eauffht th.s cold aboard it. I fell into
the river yesterday as I was coming
ashore. This cough I have is most an
noying."
Then Mr. Brennier coughs to prove
how unnoyinc it really is. He coughs
eathaslastieaTly and long and loud.
"Water," he gasps at length. his face
purple.
Water ( ausea a Loss.

Boyle and McG.e pursued that eough
from one end of the drive to the other.
They were alway: atile to hnd ffflflh

never able to catch up with it.

f Hala Holdon, president of the Chi?
cago, Burlington & Quincy, their
gpokesman, visited the White House
after dinner this evening. Prcsiduit
Wilson had talked the situation over
in the interinr with Chairmen New
lands and Adamson, of the Senate
and House Committees on Interstate
Commeree.
Statement by Holden. \
The only statement of progre<s
durinp the day was issued hy Mr.
Holden aftor his committee of eight
had reported at a brief session of all
the tifty-odd executives and man?
agers early this evenin-*. Tlie state?
ment was this:
"Thc railway executives who ha\e
met here at the request of President
Wilson are proceeding as rapidly as
practicable with their work. It must
be understood, however, the problem
with which these men are wrestling
is the most important and gipantic
ever presented to any body of men in
the industrial history of the country.
"They cannot, therefore, consist?
ently with their duty to their se?
curity holders. their employers *r
the public, reaeh a final conclusion
repardinp what action they should
take without much discussion, great
study and profound thought, and
such discussion, study and thoupht,
when participated in by praetieally
one hundred men suddenly called to
gether from all parts of the Cnited
States, require time.
"If our deliberations seem to pro
ceed slowly it is due to the facts that
I have mentioned. For us to act
hastily would be a betrayal of the
great responsibility we owe to all the
parties concerned, and most of all to
the public."
Bargainlng for Peace.
Although none of the railroad execu?
tives will admit ai much. it is believed
that the aceptance flr rejection of the
Wilson proposal by the roads dependi
upon what kind of bargain they can
make with the Administration. In tho
rr.eanwhile. individual presidents are
Bttaekiag the President's plan without
gloves. But it is more likely that if
the burden can be passed to the public
by some arrangement now in thfl
rourse of discussion the Wilson plan
will be accept. 1.
Faced by this necessity, President
Wilson sent for Senator Newlards and
Rep.-csentative Adamson this morn
ng. The President was assured, first,
that the bill increasing the Interstata
Commeree Commission to nine mem?
bers instead of seven, already passed
by the HOBBfli would be approved bj"
the Senate before adjournment. fc'ec
ondlv. all three discussed the power
fll Congress to give relief to the rail?
roads in the event that the Interstate
Commeree Commission failed to recog
i.i*e the justice of the roads* demand
for increased rates after the report of
the examiring commission proposed
bv the Pre*>ident.
The importancfl of the first of thesfl
two matters is not patent at fir*4
glance. The last 5 per cent rate
inerease was obtained by the roadfl
i only after two new Interstate Com?
meree Commissioners wajrfl appointed
