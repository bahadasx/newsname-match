Fred Lame, >(>, jeweler, committed suicide by foot
ing himself thru the head earl\ Thursday in the rear of
his little store at 41 ( > Pike St., a few hours after he
had refused to heed his wife's entreaties to return to
the home he left several years ago.
A revolver, wrapped in a towel, was in one hand
when police arrived. The police believe he committed
suicide, and wrapped up the gun in an effort to muffle
the sound.
S. C. Hazzard, Lame's former room mate at the
Barker hotel, found the body at 6:30 a. m.
"Larne was an old friend of mine, agd had been
ill and despondent." Hazzard told the p*ice. "Last
night he said he hadn't taken in a cent all day at his
I*>re. He gave me a key several months ago and asked
me to drop into the store and see him each morning,
in case he mi.cht he too ill to take care of himself."

COMPANY PAYS ON

Declaring that it is "high time for the cities to re
gain the powers of self-control" appropriated by the state
public service commission, Mayor (jill pointed I hursday
to the commission's latest ruling, which permits the tel
ephone interests in Seattle to earn on an alleged valu*
ation of $6,799,902, as evidence ot "something rotten
in Denmark." _
The public service commission's valuation ot Se
attle telephone properties was placed at 56,799,902.
Hut the corporation only pays taxes on $2,279,-
Vi 2 in the whole county, in which are located miles of,

In other words. the company Is
credited a valuation of nearly
$7,000,000 on which to base rates,
and turn* around and complain*

The commission has also gtant*d
the phone company right to charge

This Installation cost always has
been absorbed under the old rates
The new ruling eliminates all

$3.50 charge onto the burden of the
new phone user.
Put this ;* not the only Afro-

The people and the commission
have the habit of basing rates on

PRAISES POINDEXTER
Branding Rep. Humphrey of
Seattle as one who has been
conspicuous for hit hostility to
labor, and praising the work of
Senator Miles Poindexter, Sam
uel Gompers. president of th#
American Federation of Labor,
in a letter to James A. Duncan,
secretary of the Seattle Labor
council, made public today, de
clares:
"It is to be sincerely hoped
that the intelligent people of
Washington will avail them
selves of the great opportunity
now afforded them to retire
William E. Humphrey to pri
vate life and keep him there."
The letter follows:
Replying to your favor of August
S for the legislative records of Sen
ator Miles Poindexter nnd Rep.
\V. K. Humphrey. I take pleasure in
sending you herewith a detailed
record of their votes on measure*
of Interest to labor which hav#
come before the senate and house
during their membership therein,
and in addition I am pleased to
state that Senator Poindexter has
rendered equally good service In
the senate as he did in the house.
"He haa responded to our every
call without evasion, without ex
cuse. and without hesitancy. He
has been. In practically every In
stance. sympathetically helpful In
behalf of labor measures and legis
lation favoring the best interests of
all the people.
"With regards to Rep. Humphrey
ycu will note his record is conspicu
ous for his negligence and hostility.
REP. HUMPHREY HAS LOST
BUT FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO
SHOW HIS CONTEMPT FOR THE
ORGANIZATIONS OF LABOR AND
THEIR ENDEAVORS TO SECURE
REMEDIAL LEGISLATION AT
THE HANDS OF CONGRESS. He
la oue of the "old guard" that hoast
of their fidelity to the arbitrary
will of former Speaker Cannon.
"An analyst* of his voting record
shows that he had 3ri opportunities
to vote for labor measures. He
voted 13 times favorably, 11 times
against labor, twice he answered
"present" and 10 times he was "not
voting."
"Rep. Humphrey availed himself
of every opportunity to prevent the
enactment of the seamen's law,
which the American Federation of
Labor rhampioned for over ?0
years, lie evidently did not want£
the general public to go down to
the sea In safety any more than
he wanted Ihe seamen to have de
cent treatment and Ihe normal free
dom of a human being
"It is to be sincerely hoped
that the intelligent people of
Washington will avail them
selves of the great opportunity
now afforded them to retire
William E. Humphrey to private
life and keep him there."
