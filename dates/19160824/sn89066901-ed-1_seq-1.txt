People often wonder why the
Springfield Business College is
so large when there are so many
business colleges. The answer
is plain. It has the largest, best
prepared, and most experienced
faculty; its courses of study are
the best; it uses up to date sys
tems in every department; its
telegraph school is approved by
the railroads which give its stu
dents preference; it teaches the
Gregg Shorthand, which is
taught in more schools and stud
ied by more pupils than all oth
ers combined; it also teaches the
stenotype, the wonderful new
system of machine shorthand;
its system of bookkeeping is not
excelled; it never makes a con
tract it does not fulfill; its gradu
ates are in the greatest demand
by large firms; it has fewer dis
satisfied patrons than any other
business college in this section;
its graduates are life members of
the employment? department, and
are entitled to service as long as
needed. Finally, it gives its pu
pils more for their money than
they can get elsewhere. These
reasons.are sufficient. adv
PREPAREDNESS
Is the Question of the Hour
and Now Is an Oppor
tune Time to Think
As the first Monday in Sep
tember draws near, a great many
boys and girls eagerly begin to
get ready for school. They have
spent nearly four inonjths out of
school and are anxious to get
back. There is a happy expres
sion on their faces as they accost
one another on the street and
ask if they are going to start to
school. These boys and girls
are spending the early part of
their lives preparing themselves
for the future. They are laying
the foundations upon which they
will build lives worth the living.
No child has really lived if he has
not had the opportunity of asso
ciating himself with others of his
own age in the schoolroom. If
he has not participated in their
pleasures and their sorrows and
thus brought himself to sympa
thize with them, then he has not
had what was coming to him.
Some children have never had
the opportunity to go to school
and have thus missed the best
portion of their live For these
children we express our sincer
est sorrow. Perhaps their par
ents were not to blame. I be
lieve that most parents want to
do what they think is best for
their children, and most of them
conceive it to be best to send
them to school. However, there
are many parents who have so
slight a conception of the value
of an education that they will al
low their children to remain out;
of school on tbe slightest pre
text. It was for these parents
that the compulsory school law
was passed. . .
Our public schools, with - all
their imperfections, ought to be
more fully attended than they
are, for within their walls and
under the care of conscientious
teachers is undoubtedly a better
place than the streets, where
many children are found. These
boys and girls who are not found
in school or who are found there
just so long as the law compels
them are the boys and girls for
whom eleemosynary and penal
institutions are established It
is for the maintenance of these
boys and girls who grow up in
ignorance and immorality, that
the educated and the moral man
must expend his labor and his
money. Such children cannot
be a blessing to a community1
they are a handicap. No com
munity which expects to build
up its citizenship can afford to
permit one of its young people to
grow up without some sort of an
education. Education is of value
only in proportion to the number
of people in a community who
possess it. If only a third of
the people are educated, then the
community is onlyt one third ed
ucated. We should see to it that
every boy and girl in our town
gets at leust a common school
education. The welfare of soci
ety demands it.
Tbe young man who does
nothing but loaf on the street.
smoke cigarettes and tear down
what others build up has no
right to the protection which the
law affords -him. He has no
right to use the side-walks, the
parks and other conveniences
that energetic people have brou
ght into being when he does
nothing to promote the welfare
of the community. How can we
insure our children, whom we
are trying to educate, that they
will not have to build for the un
educated to tear down? There
is only one way that this can be
done, and that is by forcing all
boys and girls to get as good an
education as circumstances will
permit. There are some boys
and girls who believe that an edu
cation is not necessary; that they
ought to get a job and earn a liv
ing. Such reasons as these
have produced men and women
who had to be contented with an
unsatisfactory job all of their
lives. I would ask you, young
man, who are working for barely
enough to keep body and soul to
gether, are you satisfied with
your job? You had just as well
be satisfied. with it, for you can
not hope for a better job when
you are unprepared. Tbe world
wants trained men and you are
not trained. ' You have failed to
qualify. Competitition is keen,
and the man'Who puts bis physi
cal force ' against the mental
force of another is sure to lose.
Young man, young woman,
you owe it not only to yourself
to prepare -yourself for useful
ness but you owe it to the com
munity that makes possible the
opportunities j you have. The
community; which opens up what
it has to you has a right to ex
pect that yon give something in
return. That something, which
will be of the greatest benefit,
will be the training of whatever
talent , you jpossess and then us
ing it for the good of the com
m unity.

Sunday School Convention
The Wright County Sunday
School Association will hold its
annual convention in the Chris
tian Church at Mountain Grove,
Sept. 4-5, 1916.
The Association is an inter-de
nominational organization with
the object and purpose of raising
the standard of Sunday School
work, and to get more people to
attend the Sunday School. The
County organization articulates
with a like organization of the
state, tbe state with the nation,
and the nation with the world.
It is therefore a world-wide move
and a worthy cause.
All Sunday Schools in Wright
County are earnestly requested
to elect and send from two to
four delegates, in addition to tbe
Pastor and Superintendent, to
the Mountain Grove Convention,
where an interesting program
will be rendered along the line of
Sunday School work in general,
by some of our best county and
state Sunday School workers.
This Association does not deal
in the least with denominational
questions, and it is the duty of
each Sunday School superintend
ent in the county, regardless of
denomination, to see that your
school is well-represented at this
convention. This convention will
deal with vital Sunday School
questions and has the same bear
ing on Sunday School work that
your Teachers' Associations have
on the Common School work of
the county. It is ' a growing
work and a large attendance is
expected.

"The Daddy of 'Em Alt'.
Speaking of fish stories, fish
and fishermen, it makes no dif
ference when one returns from
a fishing trip and exhibits his
catch, the first thing the town
bunch who never got tbeir feet
wet, or caught a fish in tbeir
lives, say: "What did they cost
ye' "? "who did you buy 'em of?
There was a time when a man's
life would be in danger for malr
ing such a remark. ,But today
the "angler" pays no attention,
and goes right ahead taking his
vacation, recreation, and fishing
trips, sometimes being success
ful and sometimes catching
nothing. The most experienced
fisherman goes many a day and
works hard without result; and
often thCfishing sport, with rod
and bait, goes to his familiar
spot on the river and suffers the
humiliation of "no catch", while
a red-headed, freckle-faced, ten-year-old
boy will fish within ten
feet of him and catch a string of
fish that would make Grover
Cleveland stare in surprise.
On last Thursday afternoon,
August 17, a large cat-fish was

caught in the Gasconade river
which is believed to' be "the dad
dy of 'em all" in that stream.
The fish was caught on a trot
line, some distance above the
Manes bridge, in Wright Co.;
and weighed 23 pounds, was 4
feet, 2 inches in length and its
head 10 inches across, and was
what is known as a yellow cat.
Three fishermen, Mr. Austin
of Manes, Will Hake of Hartville,
and Dr. Riley of Mansfield, had
out two trot lines of sixty five
hooks each, and that blatne fish
got on the Austin trot-line, giv
ing him tbe honor of making tbe
catch; but the other twp anglers
have the honor of cleaning and
preparing the fish for tbe table.
And on Friday, August 18, all
who were taking meals at the
Manes Hotel bad baked fish,
stuffed with dressing, and for
several meals thereafter fish was
on the bill of fare.
When this fish was brought
into Maces the entire inhabi
tance of the village turned out to
see the monster, and the next
day, and for the balance of the
week all space along the river
for miles above and below the
bridge was taken. However,
up to the present writing the
Austin-Hake-Riley fish remains
"the daddy of 'em all".
