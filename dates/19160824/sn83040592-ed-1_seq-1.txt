Prof. J. W Twente, superin
tendent of the Baxter Springs
public schools, hat been a busy
man since bit return home last
week, looking after details and
arranging for tbe re-opening of
the schools on Monday, September
4. Concerning this event the
superintendent makes tbe follow
ing announcement to the parents
and pupils:
"The Baxter school will open
Monday, September 4. Every
pupil of school age should be on
hand tbe first day, Those pupils
who are 5 years old or who will
be 5 in the near future should be
there from tbe 'beginning as it
breaks in on the work to have
pupils entering school at irregular
intervals. The books used in
the grades will be same as those
used last year. Supplies should
be gotten now in order that all
mav cet the needed books. A
list of high school books for the
respective year can be seen at
the dealer's at any time.
"The board of education has
made a number of improvements
and additions during vacation so
that all grades and pupils will be
well accommodated. New desks
have been put in the primary
rooms. An additional teacher
has been employed for tbe coming
year so that all grades will have
whole dav sessions and thus be
better provided for than in pre
vious years.
"The board also has made pro
vision for the teaching of music
in tbe grades. One of the grade
teachers will take charge of this
work on a departmental plan.
We expect to devote more time to
this cultural subject and help
each pupil to at least appreciate
music to some extent. The edu
cational activities of tbe boys
and girls of Baxetr will be better
cared for than ever before."
Teachers employed for tbe
year are:
Mr. L. H. Barrett, Baxter
Springs, Kans.
Mrs. C. M. Yeager, Baxter
Springs, Kans.
Miss Nell Weaver, Baxter

Miss Hazel Goodwin, Baxter

Springs, Kans.

Miss Hazel Rowe, Columbus,
Kans.
. Miss Minnie Young, Galena,
Kans.
Miss Mary Davies, Riley, Kans.
The history of the Baxter
Springs schools, if we are not
mistaken, does not disclose any
notable enterprise up to a few
years ago, when its affairs were
transferred to different hands.
For about forty years the district
struggled under a bonded indebt
edness of $20,000, incurred when
the building was erected. No
effort was made to pay any of the
principal until about four years
ago. Up to that time more than
twice the original debt was paid
out in interest. Since then the
debt has been reduced to $11,000
and the building which bad be
come dilapidated from age and
wear, has been repaired from
basement to roof.
In addition to the expenses at
home tbe district has cow for
several years been contributing
about $300 00 a rear in Support
of tbe county high school. This
fact has hindered the board in
its efforts to develop the high
ichool into a fall four ju caa rie.
BOOST
Boost your city, boost your friend,
Boost the lodge that you attend,
Boost the street on which you're dwelling,
Boost tbe goods that you are selling,
Boost the people round about you,
They can get along without you,
But success will quicker find them,
If they know that ypu're behind them.
Boost for every forward movement,
Boost for every new improvement,
Boost the man for whom you labor,
Boost the stranger and the neighbor,
Cease to be a chronic knocker,
Cease to be a process blocker,
If you'd make your city better,
Boost it to the final letter.

NEW SPEED RECORDS
Restallits 113.5 Miles an Hour
at Chicago Motor
Trails.
Chicago, Aug. 18 (Special)
Thursday (the 17th) Dario Resta
made one lap of the two mile
track at the Chicago Speedway
in 1:05.44. an average of 113 5
miles per hour in his Peugeot
mount on Goodrich Silvertown
Tires.
This is the fastest two miles
that has ever been made in quali
fying heats on American speed
ways.
Such speed would never be
possible were it not for the won
derful strides which have been
made in tire-building. Goodrich
Silverton Tires, which are of a
patented cord construction, are
the shoes which most of the
racers have relied upon for tbe
past three years. They have
been on the winning cars in
every important race since 1914,
it is stated by tbe makers, the
B. F. Goodrich Co., of Akron,
Ohio.
Chautauqua begins next Satur
day; buy your season tickets

Crap Game Interrupted
Another holdup occurred at
the Frisco station Saturday night
but this time it wasn't tbe rail
road company's funds that were
taken, but rather a very exciting
crap game that was broken up.
Several town boys and some from
Quapaw district were rolling the
bones out a ways from the station
bouse about three a. m. A
nice heap of change was in sight
when a stranger dropped down on
them with a gun leveled at the
bunch. He made them hold
their hands up till he gathered
up the coin and went thro tbe
pockets of tbe sports, then he
thanked them and backed out of
sight. The victims are now more
concerned about keeping their
names out of print than getting
their money back or catching tbe
robber.

The Chautauqua.
Get your season ticket. This
is to be one of the best Chautau-
quas ever given to a Baxter
Springs crowd. The whole pro
gram is of tbe highest order.
Not one part is to be less instruc
tive, or interesting than any
other.
The musical numbers are
superb. The selection of the
voices has been carefully made
and blend perfectly. The instru
ments in the different companies
show a most happy combination
and the music will thrill every
hearer.
The lecturers are extra ordi
nary. The men come with big
thoughts and deliver them in a
most forceful manner. You
should hear all of them. Give
your encouragement by attending
as many of the numbers at you
can. m

LATENT MINES
TO START UP
Company Buys Half Interest in
Sunnyside Groupe Long
in Litigation.
A mining properties deal o
considerable interest to Baxter
Springs was closed last week
when Capt. James E. Sullivan of
Tennessee and Charles Shewy of
Virginia, acquired a one-half in
erest in the Iowa& Oklahoma
Mining Uompany, the entire
holdings of William Grimes,
president and general manager.
The properties comprise the
bulk of the Sunnyside camps in
ii r . .
iue uuapaw reservation, some
five miles south of Baxter.
The "I. & O. Company" was a
closed corporation, chartered
under the laws of the Indian
Territory. The entire stock was
owned by Mr. Grimes and A. W.
Abrams, secretary of the Quapaw
tribe, and secretary and treasurer
of the company. He will contin
ue in the same official capacity in
tbe new organisation. The
property consists of mining leas
es upon some 500 acres of land,
ith some $50,000 already spent
in drills and shafts. The camp
hat practically been idle for the
past seven years, due to litiga
tion, brought against the "I. &
O. Company" by the Federal gov
ernment upon alleged taking of
lapping leases" and the right
of Indians to sell interest in
future royalties. A decision of
the United States Supreme
Court, handed down by Justice
Charles E. Hughes, decided "lap
ping- leases" to be illegal, and
that Indians could not sell inter
est in one or all royalties until
ore had been mined and milled.
This decision clarified conditions
as regards the I & O Company,"
Not before however the big pro
ducing mills, theGoodluck, Neb
raska and Hobo had moved off
the land, under tbe assumption.
mat tne owners did not care to
remain idle pending a long drawn
out legal battle. The Lancaster,
another big producer, burned.
When litigation began there
were 19 shafts upon the property.
At present all are in fair condi
tion and all in paying ore. It
is the intention of the new organ
ization to push developments dur
ing the present lull in the market
against considerable activity dur
ing the fall months.
At present the Red Wing
shaft, operated by the Bradley
Lead and Zinc Company, and the
Fifty-Fifty, operated by Cun
nmgham and Newton, are the
only ones being worked. Robb
and Thomas of Kansas City are
doing considerable drilling, upon
a lease just north of the Good
luck property. Several rich

For Miles and Miles on the
Wrong Road and At Last
Come to a SIGN POST
Which shows you your mistake you very
naturally go straight back to the forks of the
road and start over. Many men who are
anxious to reach Financial Independence realize
that they are on the wrong road, they feel that
their earnings are merely sufficient for daily
needs, that they have no chance to accumulate
a competence. Some of these men recognize
the sign post pointing to the way outbetter
methods of handling their income. If you are
interested we shall be glad to explain to you

"A customer came into my
store the other day and said to
one of my clerks, "Have you any
thing that will cure diarrhoea?"
and the clerk went and got him
a bottle of Chamberlain's Colic.
Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy.
and said to him, "If this does
not cure you, I will not charge
you a cent for it." So he took it
home and came back in a day or
two and said he was cured,"
