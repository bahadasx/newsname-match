IMPROVE POULTRY FLOCK
BY CULLING OUT THE
SCRAWNY PULLETS.
Caponlze Young Cockerels Not Need
ed for Breeding.
By a strict system of culling, the
egg-laying and other desirable qual
ities of the poultry flock can be im
proved to a marked extent. Go
through the entire flock carefully and
cull out the pullets that do not give
promise of becoming good producers.
The ones that are left should be
marked so that you will know them,
as they will be the basis of the breed
ing stock. If there are any young
cockerels that will not he needed for
next season, it is high time that they
be caponized. W. II. Gates,
Louisiana State University.
FEED THE HAY CROP AT
HOME.
Utilize Both the Feeding and Fertiliz
ing Value.
A well-balanced farm should carry
enough live stock to consume all the
roughage and grain the farm can pro
duce. If, however, more hay is pro
duced than can be used at home, then
only 'he best should be sold, as the
inferior grades will ordinarily not
bring enough on the market to justify
Belling ft.
When fed at home, both the feeding
and fertilizing' value of the hay is util
ized. When sold it is seldom that the
price received equals both these val
ures; and the fertilizing value, at least,
1 b lost. E. L. Jordan,
Louisiana State University.
HORSES' TEETH SHOULD BE
EXAMINED REGULARLY.
Horses, like people, have trouble
with their teeth, and If the latter are
no, examined periodically, and any de
fect present, corrected, bad resuïts
are likely to follow, especially through
improper nourishment o he animal
on account of imperfect mastication,
or chewing, of the food, and in some
instances, actual starvation, a case of
which the writer has personally wit
nessdl.
Up to the time a horse has got all
of its adult, or permanent, teeth, or
when it is about four and one-half
years of age, the colt teeth are grad
ually being shed to make way for the
permanent ones. In most cases the
change takes place naturally and witn
out wry tr o u We r twit o l- jgl o nat ty
young animal will be found with some
colt teeth remaining that should have
w>en out to make room for the horse
teeth which are to replace them. Such
a condition may be seen in young
horses or mules at any time until all
of the colt teeth have disappeared
frrrr the mouth, and the horse has a
fu! et of permanent ones, which, as
we re just stated, is about four and
one-paif years old.
Such irregularities of the teeth pre
rent young animale from chewing their
food properly, and accounts, in such
cases, for 'heir lack of thrift and back
ward cm.dition. Tha indications here,
are that young stock of this kind
Aould have their teeth,regularly ex
amined at least once a year, and any
colt teeth found remaining, that may
be loose, or that may be interfering
with the eruption of the older teeth
removed from the mouth, either by the
fingers, or forcept if necessary, whic?
will generally give an animal a fresl
start on its way to a more thrifty
condition. Older animals, also, re
quire to have their teeth periodically
looked after. With ' the constant
grinding of the food, even if the
grinding surfaces should remain sat
isfactory, the edges of the molar, or
back teeth, sometimes become so
sharp »9 to out and lacerate the
cheeks or wound the tongue, and in
this way prevent the animal from
chewing as it naturally should.
By looking into the mouth and ex
amining the upper and lower grinders
of either side, it will be found that
it Is the outer edges of the upper ones
that are sharp and which injure the
cheeks: and thq inner edges of the
lower teeth that are liable to wound
the tongue.
When this condition is found, and
which would be indicated by the an
imal remaining thin, perhaps "quid
ding" its food, or whole grains being
passed in the manure, etc., the thing
to do would be to carefully file off
the line of sharp, rough edges.
It should be stated, however, that
while the edges mentioned are natur
ally a little more prominent than tt
other parts of the teeth, they sboul.
not feel so sharp as to injure ti<
parts with which they come in con
tact—the excessive sharpness heir
due more or less to constant grirdin .
when feeding.
More serious conditions occasionally
arise, which require the attention ol
:!u> .er., -rt. such, for example, at
where one or more teeth have been
knocked out, and the opposing on<
grow st long as to cat right into tl.
g im. or even into the bone. Or, ■
the case of a diseased tooth that r
quires extraction.
However, by regular examination
of the teeth and the simpler irreg
ularitics corrected at the time, ti e
more serious forms need never occur
We would recommend to those owr
ing horses and mules, there Are, th'
they make it a regular practice •
examining the teeth of their anima
both before and after they get tb'
permanent o; adult t- eth. It is gab
so important mutte: .

SELECT HEAD OF HERD
WITH GREAT CARE.
Purity of Blood Very Desirable, Bmx
N ot An Absolute Guarontr ^
Excellence.
-* #
Not enough attention is gi\ •_ ilia
selection of the head or the h.*rd,
whether It be a herd of cattle, hogf or
other farm animals. Tue fact that tne
character of the next generation of
j live stock, and, soon, that of the en
j tire breeding herd, will be determined
j by the sire that is being used, should
I be kept constantly in mind. The sire
exerts an influence on the herd equal
to that of all the females combined,
and for this reason, much more 'care
and study must be given to both his
j individual make-up and ancestry than
j is necessary in case of any female
I member of the herd,
j The pedigree of the male must be i
1 stuiued, not so much for the purpose !
J of finding therein the names of fa- '
mous ancestors which have been
show animals, as ta form an estimate
as to the probabilities of the male in
question being able to transmit the
essential qualities of utility. The im
mediate parents exert by far the great
est influence on the make-up and
breeding qualities of an individual. If
either parent is not strong and vigor
ous, or if each of these parents have
not already produced other animals of
exceptional merit, it is not considered
good business to pay a very large price
for one of their offspring. Unless the
parents have proved their ability to
produce excellence in a large numner
of their offspring the chances are that
the animal in question wflll prove a
great disappointment. All of the
grandparents combined exert an influ
ence about equal to one immediate
parent and that should be taken into
account. The influence of any given
ancestor back of the grandparents is
so smai. as to be practically a negli
gible quantity.
After care has been exercised In the
selection of the sire, both for indi
vidual excellence and good ancestry,
the real trial comes when the actual
breeding qualities of the male are
tested out by mating him to a few fe
males which have proved their merit
as breeders. If his offspring with
these females fail to show exceptional
merit, til en he should be discarded at
once and another young male tried out
in the same way until a satisfactory
one is found. Successful breeders are
always trying out young males for the
purpose of having something reliable
in reserve. The failure to take this
■tlm-* tflrtoîair e?
many excellent herds. Certainly noi
more than one in four of the most
promising offspring of exceptiona 1
parents, backed up by the best of an
cestry, ever really added anything to
the excellence of the breed. The se
lection, then, by pedigree and Individ
uality, simply increases the chances
of getting a satisfactory herd sire to
about one in four. The wise and sue
cessful breeder is not willing to take
this risk, but prepares beforehand un
til he is absolutely sure of his ground
Not so much attention need be paid
to the selection of the herd sire in
case where the stock is kept for util
ity alone, as in case of a man raising
hogs for market, but in this case also
It is of first importance that the hero
sire comes of good parents and tha
he is strong and vigorous in every
way. Purity of blood is no absolute
guaranty of excellence. The chance?
are that the pure-bred sire will be
able to transmit the desired qualit!e c
with much more certainty than in
case of the animal with a mixed an
cestry, but vitality and_ prolificacy
are the all-important and far-reaching
factors to be considered

POULTRY IS A READY
SOURCE OF CASH.
Clean Surroundings Essential—Good
Market For Products.
One of the problems that confronts
the farmer, even though he be mode
rately prosperous, is that of securing
ready cash. The salaried man usual
ly has more or less cash, though he
may not have much else. As a means
Of providing ready cash, at all seasons
Of the year, the poultry yard, when
properly managed, is perhaps the most
dependable. It involves little expense
where the feed is produced on the
farm, and the return from poultry and
eggs are certain. There is today an
almost unlimited market for such
products, and there Is no evidence
that the future demands will diminish
The essentials In raising poultry
are clean and saffltary surroundings
abundance of green food, which c
