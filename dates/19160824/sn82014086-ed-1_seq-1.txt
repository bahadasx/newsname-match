machine bore r.o lights and the officer
called the attention of the driver to

ATTITUDE OF GREEKS
south of the town. Bitter fighting is
going on in this region, the Germans
counter-attacking with great violence.
In these counter-attacks they succeed
ed in entering some of the British
trenches but, according to London,
they were immediately evicted.
The fierce struggle around Fleury,
in the Verdun sector, continues with
unabated violence. The French claim
"on appreciable advance" between
Fleury and Thiaumont and the cap
ture of two hundred prisoners.
Conflicting claims are made by Ber
lin and Petrograd in regard to the
fighting on the eastern front. Both
sides report the capture of positions
near Jablonitza Pass, where a violent
struggle has been in progress for sev
eral days on the crest of the Carpa
thians. Berlin also claims the san
guinary repulse of Russian attempts
to cross the Stokhod and apparently
fighting ot an extremely desperate
character is general in that district.
Both Berlin and London continue
to make claims and counter-claims in
regard to the recent fighting in the
North Sea. Berlin admits that the
battleship Westfalen was struck by
a torpedo from an English submarine,
but maintains that the damage was
slight. In return the German admir
alty reiterates its claim that a Brit
ish battleship was heavily damaged
by a German submarine. This is de
nied by the British admiraltq.
CONFERENCES ON THE
MEXICAN BORDER PROBLEM
Are to Be Held at Some Place on the
Nevy England Coast.
Washington, Aug. 23. There were
two developments today in the Mexi
can, situation. Secretary Lansing and
Kiiseo Arrcdondo, Mexican ambassador-designate,
tentatively agreed that
the joint commission to discuss border
problems should meet at some place
on the Xew F.r.gland coast during the
first week in September. Brigadier
General Pershing transmitted a report
saying the general opinion was that
"Villa's prestige is gone and that he
can never again become a serious fac
tor in Mexican affairs."
Supporting, as it docs, General Per
shing's recent recommendation for the
withdrawal of the expeditionary force
in 'Mexico, it is believed General Per
shing's report makes it certain that the
American commissioners will agree
promptly to the suggestions of their
Mexican conferees for the early recall
of the troops.
Mr. Arredondo called at th edepart
ment to receive formal notification
that the American commissioners had
been selected and were ready to meet
the Mexican members as soon as the
time and place could be arranged. Both
the embassy and the department were
in communication with Mexico City to
night in regard to the fixing of a date
for beginning the sessions.
OFFICERS' RESERVE CORPS

First Steps Towards Organization to
Be Taken at Plattsburg.
Plattsburg, X. T., Aug. 23. One of
the first steps towards organizing an
officers' reserve corps of the United
States army under the provisions of
the new army bill will be taken here
at the end of the present training camp
for civilians. Copies of the army or
der riving the plan of organization
have been received and arrangements
are being made for the xaminations
which several hundred Plattsburg
graduates are expected to take. Major
General Leonard Wood has urged the
members of the two training regiments
to submit to these examinations and
expressed the hope that this is only
the beginning of a system of compul
sory military training.
The regimental commanders are pre
paring to instruct applicants for ad
mission to the reserve corps in addi
tion to the training ordinarily received
in this camp.
The law creating the reserve corps
provides that any citizen, other than
officers of the regular army or of the
militia, is eligible for a commission in
he reserve.

Shortly Be Repaired.
London, Aug. 23, 8.20 p. m. The
German battelship Westfalen was hit
and slightly damaged on Saturday by
a British torpedo, it was admitted in

British submarine E-23 upon a Ger
man battleship of th Nassau class in
the North Sea. The submarine com
mander reported that while the ship
was being escorted back to port in
a damaged condition he attacked again
and struck her with a second torpe
do and believed she was unk.
The Westfalen is one of the Nassau

May but afterwards was declared by
the" German admiralty to be safe in a
home port.
SENATE OCCUPIED WITH
EMERGENCY REVENUE BILL
Senator Penrose Vigorously Opposed
the Measure.
Washing, D. C, Aug. 23. Debate in
the senate on the emergency revenue
bill today was featured by a long
speech by Senator Penrose, urging in
dustrial preparedness to saecun.rd the
countrv against commercial warfare at
the close "of the European war and
vigorously attacking the pending
measure. He questioned the legality
of the proposed munitions tax and
criticized the proposed inheritance tax
and the general democratic adanoe
toward substituting direct taxation for
the projective tariff.
Senator Underwood, democrat, au
thor of the present tariff law, and
Senator McLean of Connecticut, re
publican, also participated in the dis
cussion, the former defending the tar
iff law against republican attacks and
the latter charging the democratic ad
ministration with extravagance and
deporing its tendency to resort to
sources, for federal taxation that
should be reserved to the states.
VILLAGES ENDANGERED BY
FIRECE FOREST FIRES

will be wiped -out bv fierce forest fires j
that have been raging there for over
two weeks, as the whole forest resion
is in a huge sea of flames. Smoke
from these tires is so dense that navi

their service ends. The general did
not know what would be become of
the equipment. If it is turned over
to the state he will ask the war de
partment to take it off his hands.

Remove Bar Against
Born Citizens.
Foreign
Atlantic City, N. J., Aug. 23. Reor
ganization of the Order of United
American Mechanics, with a possible
change of name, is the chief business
before the annual meeting of the na
tional council here. Nearly every state
is represented in the gathering. In
spite of an increase in membership
from 35,183 in 1915 to 3S.143 this year,
some leaders say the bars against for
eign born citizens should be let- down
to make the order more truly Ameri
can and to increase its membership.
"The country admits men of foreign
birth to citizenship; why should we
not admit them to membership?" asked
C. G. Nagel, .state vice councillor of
Pennsylvania.
There is a proposal to change the
name of the organization to the Order
of United American Men.

Large Gas Tank
Encircisd by Fire
WAS GREAT DANGER OF EXPLO
SION IN HARLEM
5,000,000 FEET OF GAS
Hundreds of Women and Children Ran
Screaming Through the Streets
fa
Many Sought Refuge in Cellars
New Tork, Aug. 23. Danger of the
explosion of one of the largest gas
tanks in the city, at 110th to lllt'h
street, between First and Second ave
nues, from which flames were shoot
ing, today caused hundreds of women
and children to run screaming through
the streets.
The prompt action of the employes of
the Consolidated Gas company in
drawing off the gas in this half filled
tank and piping it by underground
system to a Long Island reservoir pre
vented an explosion. The fire was ac
cidentally caused by the ignition of
aluminum paint.
Two Alarms.
Two alarms called many pieces of
fire apparatus to the flame-encircled
tank, and firemen worked on the circu
lar runways while reserves from the
I04th street station herded frightened
crowds back to Third avenue.
As the great dome of the tank sank
tinder the withdrawal of one-half mil
lion cubic feet of gas, as estimated by
the fire department, the work of the
firemen was made easier, and the fire
was finally extinguished with a loss
estimated at S40.
Sought Safety in Cellars.
Many who thought they had been
trapped in the vicinity and feared to
leave their houses sought refuge in
the cellars. In some instances fright
ened mothers with babies in their arms
fled across roofs.
Captain Brady of the East 104th
street station and his reserves steadily
drove the crowds westward to Third
avenue. Many of the women were so
frightened that they boarded Third
avenue elevated trains and surface
cars to escape from the locality.
The fire started while 20 painters
were working on the second tier of
runways, and dames from the burning
paint immediately crept around the
tank and shot upwards to a great
height. In close proximity to the tank
was a twin circular reservoir of the
Consolidated Gas company, which tow
ered to the height of about 250 feet,
and was said to contain 5,000,000 cubic
feet of gas. The diameter of each tank
was about 150 foot.
The sudden burst .of flame was seen
by scores of tenants of nearby houses.
Frightened women, dreading an e"xplo
si .n. ran from their homes and filled
the streets.

NO ANSWER FROM RAILROAD HEADS
Three of Them Held a Conference, With President
Wilson Last Night
QUESTION OF RAISING
One of the Means Suggested by President Wilson to the
Railroads is Through an Increase in the Freight FJates
It is Now Evident That the Railroad Executives Believe
the Only Way of Preventing a Strike is by Accepting
the Eight Hour Plan Deliberating on How Shorter
Work Day Can Be Put in Force With the Least Addi-
tional Expense.
Washington, Aug. 23. In another
effort to aid the presidents of the
country's railroads to find some way
in which to accept an eight hour day
for their trainmen and avert tho
threatened strike, President Wilson
tonight conferred for an hour and a
half with Presidents Hale Holden of
the Burlington, Daniel Willard of the
Baltimore and Ohio and R. S. Lovett
of the Union Pacific.
Keither White House officials nor
the presidents would discuss the con
ference. It was said on authority,
however, that the three executives
went to the White House to receive
an answer to the suggestion they
made to Mr. Wilson last night and he
gave them more specific information
as to how the railroads may get the
additional revenue necessary to take
care of t.he greater payrolls that will
come with the eight hour day.
Earlier in the day President Wilson
discussed the railroad situation at
length with Senator' Newlands and
Representative Adamson, chairman of
the two committees of congress in
charge of legislation affecting Inter
state commerce. Their visit was the
consequence of that of the railroad
metn last night. The two chairmen are
said to have agreed that the presi
dent's position in the present situa
tion was right and to have said that
every effort could be expected in con
gress to put through any legislation
which might help solve the present
difficulty and provide for the future.

since the beginning of the war, se
cured clearance papers, today and is
expected to sail tomorrow morning for
Xew London, Conn. It was stated that
the vessel's departure has nothing to
do with the expected arrival at the
Connecticut port of the merchant sub
marine Bremen, but that the change
was decided upon because of more fa
vorable docking facilities in the Con
necticut city. The liner is expected to
pass through the Cape Cod canal and
to keep well within the three-mile
limit.

gar R. Brown died in the City hospi
tal from effects of the heat wave to
day, and George H. Odium, 44, and Pat
rick Mclntyre, 45, were overcome, and
had to bo taken to the hospital. Ther
mometers exposed to the sun regis
tered 110 degrees.
ADDITIONAL REVENUE
One of the means for re-couping
suggested by the president to the rail
roaus in hi3 public outline of his po
sition was Through an increase in the
freight rates. It was pointed out to
night that the president cannot di
rectly ask the interstate commerce
commission to grant increases to the
railroads. Congress, however, might
pass a resolution directing the com
mission, in view of what it considers
an unprecented situation, to Krant
higher rates.
Congress also might pass a resolu
tion directing the commission to in
vestigate all matters involved in the
present controversy and the whole
subject of the relations of railroads
and their employes. One result ex
pected from today's conference is an
early effort to pass the bill introducfk
several months ago' to increase tl.a
commission's membership from seven
to nine.
It became evident tonight that most
of the railroad executives have come
to believe that there can be only one
way of preventing a strike and that
is by accepting the eight hour plan.
The chief effort in their own confer
ences today was to find some scheme
by which an eight hour day may be
put i noperation on all the railroads"
at the least added expense.
Many suggestions along this line
have been made by the presidents, but,
not one of them has proved feasiblei
