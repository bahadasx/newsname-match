Reno Crowds Applaud Vig
orous Criticism of For
eign Policy.
RENO, Nev., Aug. 24.?CharleB E.
Hughes made his first appearance in
a strong Democratic State yesterday
and signalled it by making three ad
dresses to a total of 100,000 persons,
in which he strongly criticisod the
Democratip Administration for its con
duct in many phases of government.
He told an audience at the Majes
tic theatre here last night that this
Nation's prestige has' diminished 50
per cent, in the eyes of the world be
cause of the vacillating policy" which
the Administration has pursued to
ward Mexico and that it's tariff policy
and its failure to maintain a high
standard in appointments to national
posts jeopardized the country.
Despite the character of the audi
ence, which was largely Democratic,
Mr. Hughes' vigorous assertion that
ho criticised the Democratic only be
cause it was just criticism, aroused
vigorous applause.
Mr. Hughes reiterated again his be
lief in the necessity for a high tariff
to protect American industries, and
he characterized the unemployed thou
sands of New York in 1914 as the "earl
tarifT experts." His tarift views were
well received, for there is great con
cern felt here over the effect of the
Underwood tariff on bef, mutton and
wool, three of the four principal in
dustries of the state.
None of Mr. Hughes' advisers be
lieve that he will carry Nevada, which
is proverbially Democratic in tone,
and it is admitted by Republicans that
President Wilson has unusual strength
here. There is a strong pacifist sen
timent all over the state, in which
.the. women, who have juffraFe lead.

'HE GIRL WHO WAS KISSED
WILL TUNNEL THE
ENGLISH CHANNEL
War Proves to Prance and
England That fiThey
Need ItJ?
(By Associated-Press)
PARIS, Aug. 24.?France has taken
all tho necessary steps to enter Into
negotiations tytth England to build
Jointly a tunnel under the English
channel to conncct tho two countries,
the long-talked of project which the
war has revived because It has demon,
stratcd as nothing else could the val
ue of the tube, to both countries.
Had the tunnerieen In existence
during the present conflict It would
have been of Immeasurable value to
England and France for the trans
portation of troops' and supplies and
would have liberated French and Brit
ish war vessels from ono of their
biggest tasks.
The plans were outlined by M. Sar.
tlaux, chief engineer of the Nord Rail,
way company, who is one of the
strongest advocates of the project. He
said:
"The tunnel will Cost 16.000,000
pounds, half of which would he borne
by England and half by Franco. Each
country would bore ono halt of tho
tunnel. Well, Britain js spending Just
now 6,000,000 pounds per day and
France 4,000,000 pounds so that two
days' ? war-time expenditure of both
countries would moro than cover the
cost of making the tunnel.
"It is proposed to make two tun
nels, one for traffic from Franco to
England, another for traffic from Eng.
land to France. Some people seem
to think a cross-channel tunnel might
be a danger, because it might fall into
the hands of the enemy. To capture
the French end would not be an easy
task. Tho mouth of the tunnel on
French soil would bo ton miles from
the coast, and In order to roach It the
enemy would have to capture Calais,
and negotiate three intervening hills
of an average height of 160 feet.
"The tunnel on the French side
would begin Its Journey under sea at
Sangatte. In my bollef It would be
impossible for an enemy to reach the
mouth of the tunnel ad get at the elec.
trie plant. The motive power could
be Instantly suppressed and the tun
nel immediately rendered uselesB by
filling It with poisonous gas.
"One can hardly exaggerate the
services the tunnel would have ren
dered to England and France had it
boon in oxistence when hostilities
broke out. During tho twenty hours'
of delay use (for four hours must be
deducted out of the twenty.four for
upkeep and repairs, etc.) between
100 and 120 trains could have been
sent In each direction.
"At 600 tons per train that rep
resents 60,000 to 60.000 tons a day
each way, much more than Is neces
sary.
"Apart from the diminution in de
lay, risks, losses, and difficulties or
every nature, the British fleet would
have been liberated from one or tho
heaviest parts of Its task and freo to
serve the cause of the Allies In other
direction^," t ...l ^~

State Fire Marshal Sends
Representatives to Visit
Fire Chief.
Will Lower Insurance Rates
by Reducing the Fire
Hazard.
Arrangements were made yesterday
with Chief 0. J. Watkins by a repre
sentative of the State Fire Marshal's
department for an inspection of the
business section of Fairmont with a
view to lessening the fire hazards.
This inspection will begin on Monday,
September 11. Following the effort
to "clean up" Fairmont, the inspectors
will visit Grafton, Morgantown, Clarks
burg and Parkersburg.
Special effort will be made to free
basements, cellars and areaways of
rubbish, a known cause of many spon
taneous flres and a menace to the com
munity. Electric light wiring, the num
ber and location of exits and the gen
eral handling of waste will be inspect
ed, and wherever improvement is con
sidered necessary, orders will be serv
ed on property owners.
John S. Horan, the state fire mar
shal, ia anxious to place West Vir
ginia at the top in the list of states
with a low Are loss. Something like
a sixteen per cent, reduction was at
fected in West Virginia last year as
a result of efficient supervision by
his department. As insurance rates

WASHINGTON, D. C? Auk. 24?
There wero two developments yester
day in the Mexican situation. Secre
tary Lansing anil, Eliseo Arredondo,
Mexican Ambassador designate, ten
tatively agreed that the joint commis
sion to discuss border problems should
meet at some place on the New En
gland coast during the first week in
September. Brigadier General Persh
ing transmitted a report saying the
general opinion was that "Villa's pres
tige is gone and that ho can never
again become a serious factor in Mex
ican affairs."
Supporting as it does General Fun
ston's recent recommendation for the
withdrawal of the expeditionary force
in Mexico, it is believed General Persh
ing^ report makes it certain that the
American commissioners will agree
promptly to the suggestions of their
Mexican conferees for the early recall
of the troops.
Elision Arredondo, Mexican ambas
sador designate, announced after a
conference with Secretary Lansing
that the International Joint Commis
sion would "meet on the New England
Coast during the first week 0f Sep
tember." Further discussion with the
commissioners will precede the selec
tion of a definite place and time.
In a telegram to the war depart
ment today, Brigadier General Persh
ing reported that Francisco Villa, when
last heard from, was making his way
south into Durango with a small fol
lowing and that the opinion was gen
eral that his prestige was gono and
that he never again could become a
serious factor in Mexican affairs.
General Pershing said that until re
cently Villa had been secluded in the
mountains of Southern Chihuahua
where he was. driycn last April by
American troops.'

j That the interest in the merits of

night by the representative audience
that filled the county court room at1

'? ;
# Mrs. Florence BfowniGotnam, 6f Iiit-'

the, advocates oil equal suffrage, and
Miss Marjorie Dorm~n,' of Baltimore,
represented the opposition, sl^h wo
men are tho: :uglily well posted and
exceedingly charming speakers and
they handled the subject in a most
entertaining manner.
The audience, which included some
of the most prominent men and women
I in Fairmont, probably was pro suf
I fr-"? in its sympathies but that did
I not prevent it from roundly applaud
ing the points made b;- Miss Dorman.
T'rs. Cotnam was also generously ap
plauded.
The urguments used by both speak
ers were those familiar to the people
in the audience who have made a
study of the question, and that proba
bly means most of those who were
there, but both speakers presented
thoir eases in such a way as to make
the rpeeches seem fresh and the de
bate might have been prolonged con
siderably without wearying the audi

Two Men Injured

MUST PAY ANYHOW
Judge White Rules County
Court May Levy For
Bond Issue.
The motion to modify the Lincoln j
district road bond injunction, which
consumed cjmost two days of the spe
cial term of circuit court in listening
to the arguments of tho attorneys for
and against, was passed upon by spe
cial Judge Kemble White yesterday
evening, he ruling in favor of the mo
tion. This decision will allow the

required as if the bonds had been sold
and the sheriff will proceed to collect
the assessment thus laid.
No further work will be done upon
tho roads however, and the bonds
cannot be sold until the matter is fin
ally decided at the next term of the
court. The motion to dissolve the
injunction Is the next step that will
be heard in this controversy.
