occurred at their home in Darlington

At 9:30 o'clock Wednesday morning,

^ McManus' farm five miles from town

Mrs. Harriet Pee Lynch, president

speakers at the opening session of

Greenville last Monday.
The Greenville Daily News in its
account of the meeting said:
"Mrs. Harriet P. Lynch, of Cheraw,
president of the State Equal
Suffrage League, was interesting and
instructive in her discussion of the
changes of economical conditions
brought about by the massing of capital
and the agge^ation of labor, and
impressed the part oragnized labor
had done to improve conditions. She
pleaded for woman's ballot, asking
that they be allowed as good conditions
in the workshop as men, and
that this was a necessary factor to
obtain this coming reality."

State Speakers Heard
In Chesterfield
The candidates for State offices
spoke in Chesterfield last Thursday
and were given a respectful hearing
by a large and orderly audience,
among whom were many ladies.
Judge M. J. Hough presided, introducing
the speakers in his usual
dignified manner. I
When the speaking was only fairly
begun it looked as though the crowd
was in to witness* some pretty
"rough stuff." (
Dr. E. C. L. Adams, candidate for
Lieutenant-Governor, had followed
Mr. Bethea, his opponent, on the ,
stand, and at the conclusion of his
speech, was attacked by Mr. A. A.
Wilkes, of Darlington, a former
school mate of Mr. Bethea. ,
The concluding portion of Dr.
Adam's speech was a joke about a
negro's pig in a bag becoming a .
puppy at the other enrl i: ?
In applying this to the conduct of
Mr. Bethea, Dr. Adams said he didn't ,
"care to have anything to do with ;
any man who was a Christian at one
end of the line and a crook at the ,
other." Dr. Adams was walking to (
the door at the back of the stage with
these as his concluding words when
he was intercepted by Mr. Bethea (
who asked what was that he had
said.
"I said it," Dr. Adams replied. In- ,
stantly Mr. Wilkes flashed through <
the doorway and landed a heavy
blow on Dr. Adan^'s chin. The two
men clinched and fell to the floor ,
before others could interfere, where ,
they struggled and writhed until they
were drugged apart. (
Fined Ten Dollars <
In .the afternoon Mr. Wilkes was
fined $10. The Darlington county
man said he had known Mr. Bethea j
a number of years ago, when the two j
were small boys in school, but that
they had not been together since.
He said he had champipned the cause j
of Mr. Bethea voluntarily. a
Barring this incident the day
passed off with no nudue excitement.
Captain W. T. Thrower, of Che- 1
raw, running for Railroad Commissioner,
seemed to inspire some enthusiasm.
c
Perhaps the most finished address
*u.. ? * - --
v.! me uctastion was thai of Mr. John J
Madison Des Champs, for Governor. I v
lie began his speech with a warm v
tribute to Lord Chesterfield, heartily
commending his principles of conduct
to the State of South Carolina, i
deploring the fact that in politics es- v
pecially, we seem to have lost the j
finer sensibilities of which this man
was the most noteworthy exponent.
He believes that South Carolina r
has the climate and geographical t
location to make it the most desirable v
spot on the globe. He deplored the r
presnt chaotic conditon of our politics
and blamed much of our lack of
progress to this cause. f,
In his eloquent appeal for no north,
no south, no east, no west, but one
united country he reminded one of
the great speech of the immortal (
Henry W. Grady at the close of the r
Civil War. Whether Mr. Des Champs j<
gets many votes or not, we are sure c
he has won many admirers who will f
never miss an opportunity to hear ,3
him speak. t,
John T. Duncan said he had made f
one vote for Governor Manning by p
? -- * - - -
><v i.ik ii abatement made bjT Cole ^
L. Blease on practically every stump \
that George Younginer, of Laurens t\
County, who was killed by a negro, t
was a Confederate soldier. R. A. p
Cooper, candidate for Govern' r and
solicitor of the Sth Judical Circuit,
prosecuted the case referred to and 0
the sentence of death was imposed, a
On this ocasion Mr. Blease told how s
Younginer, a Confederate veteran,
"was shot down and his body burned,
and how Manning had commuted his n
sentence. He then referred the p
crowd to R. A. Cooper.
"If the facts are not as I have
stated, I'll withdraw from the race fi
and disgrace myself for life by vot- c
ing for Dick Manning for Governor." a
Later on when Mr. Cooper was <|
speuking, Mr. Duncan interrupted
him long enough to ask him if Yonginer
was a Confederate veteran, p
"lie was not a Confederate veteran," n
Mr. Cooper promptly replied. Mr.
Duncan thanked Mr. Cooper and re
piled mat ne had made at least one t
vote for Mr. ManningMr.
Blouse told the crowd that the
brains that managed the State As- J
ylum were applied by a yankee sub- y
ordinate and not by the superinten- ,
dent at all. That Mr. Mailing's par- t
don record was about as bad as his 1
and that law and order do not exist j
to-day, not even in Chesterfield c
county, citing the Pageland riots as
proof of his assertions. He predicted
that this election would be stolen
and calld upon his friends to watch i
the polls.
Governor Manning made a vigorous
speech, defending his adminis- >
tration and reminded that the issues 5
were the same as those of two yars
agoe. The Chief Executive disclaimed
support from the iiquor in- 1
tereats. "They are not supporting <
me," Mr. Manning said. 'They know
what I have done for them and they
have got it in for me. They know I'll
nevpr compromise with their crime
and that I will continue relentlessly
in hunting them down." He made
an eloquent plea in behalf of his
management of the State Hospital.
Mr. Cooper spoke at a disadvantage.
The people wer tired after
standing in the heat and when Manning
and Blease had finished many
began to leave.

Chesterfield Takes
Two From Wadesboro
! The Chesterfield ball team covered
itself with glory last Thursday when
it won two Kames from the fast
Wadesboro aggregation. Several hundred
Wadesboro and Anson county
| people came along to attend the campaign
and root for Wadesboro. And
| they did cheer for their team, which
was a good one. But the home boys
had the best of both games because
Chesterfield had the better ball team.
Mr. Dunlap, of Wadesboro, and Dr.
Iteece Funderburk, of Dudley, umpired
both games, alternating each
inning from base umpire to ball and
ctriUoc RnlU ? a?-**
..? uum unijiiica j^ave satisiaction
to both teams.
The morning game was won by
Chesterfield getting onto the slants
of Morrow's (Wadesboro's pitcher)
curves and the score was 5 to 2 in
Chesterfield's favor. Stanley, pitching
for Chesterfield, was steady
throughout and had Wadesboro at his
mercy all the time.
The afternoon game developed into
a pitcher's duel between Patchell for
Chesterfield and Effird.a leaguer, pitching
for Wadesboro, with Patchell
getting the best of the argument, no
less than fifteen Wadesboro men fanning.
Chesterfield won this game
by the score of 3 to 2, which was the
best game played on the local diamond
this year.
The main feature of the game was
the heavy hitting of our own Emsley
Armfield. Mr. Armfield was some
years ago the crack first baseman of
the star Trinity College team in the
days when Brudsher, of Trinity, was
the best college pitcher in the South.
Though out of the game for several
years, Mr. Armfield has not lost his
batting eye, as proved by his two
three-base hits, his two two-baggers
three singles. Hardison. for Wades
boro, played good b?'" and hit well.
The Chesterfield team was composed
of Stanley, of Chesterfield, and
Patchell, of Cheraw, pitchers; Rivers,
of Mt. Croghan, catcher; Van Mungo,
of Pageland, first baseman; LeRoy
McCall, of Pageland, second
baseman; Emsley Armtield, of Chesterfield,
shortstop; Captain Henry
Douglass, of Chesterfield, third baseman;
the old reliable, Jule McGregor,
of Ruby, John Lee, of Angelus, Gene
l.owery, of Morven; King Moore and
P.illie Gulledge, of Chesterfield, alter
nating in the outfield.
All the boys played well and everyone
is congratulating them. Manager
Pat Murray and ('apt. llenry
Douglass are to be congratulated on
assembling such a strong bunch of
ball players. The only regret is that
"Red" White could not play and
"Bunk" Myres could not root. These
two gentlemen were detained at their
place of business in the Chesterfield
Drug store.
