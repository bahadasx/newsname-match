" lowans from all parts of the

exchanging reminiscences in the
park this afternoon following a
typical Iowa dinner. The af-
4 fair is the most . successful
gathering of former Iowans held
i, in years, and sets a high mark
for the other state organlza-
tions to shoot at In their com-
ing picnics. Other picnics which
will follow soon are the Wood

The Iowa people had their picnic
In Lithia park today. Up to 2 o'clock
this afternoon there were about 130
registered, most of whom had their
dinner In the park, and more were
coming all the time.
The Buckeye bunch had a novel
plan for registration, a map of the
state about three by four, feet was
fastened to a board and nailed up on
a tree. Each person registering was
furnished with a slip of paper with
lis name and the name of the coun
ty from which he hailed.
At the same time a carbon copy
ef the slip was made on a card with
a blue string through a hole at one
end. On each county on the map
a brass-headed tack was nailed. Each
person, upon registering pinned the
paper slip to his clothing and hung
the card with the same inscription
cm the proper tack on the map, thus
indicating the place from whence he
came.
The cards were pretty well scat
tered over the map, but were thickest
in the northwestern, western central,
central, southern central and eastern
central part of the state.
O'Brien county led with nine cards
and Decatur county came next with
tight. However, these records may
Ve changed before night when some
ether county may lead.
About 2 o'clock the crowd was
rathered for a short program after
which they intended to Indulge in
eports of various sorts. One baseball
bat was in evidence so no doubt the
freat American game was not to be
slighted. The Iowa set is a pretty
etalwart looking bunch aid all seem
ed to be proud of their state.
C. D. Hoon, of Medford, has been
the past president of the association
and Mrs. H. C. Behling, also of Med
ford, the past secretary and treasurer.
In Monday's isBue of the Tidings
will appear the names of the newly
elected officers and also a complete
list of those registering.
Beet Land Options
Expire September
J Some time ago options were obtain
"ed on a vast acreage of land In Sams
valley and tributary valleys by the
Page-Dressier company, presumably
with the view to establishing a great
-ugar beet industry in that section.
It was rumored that a colony of
' Russians was to have been estab
lished on the land. The options on
the land which is mostly in small
ranches, expires on September 1.
According to J. I. Fredenburg, who
waB in from his Sams valley ranch
Thursday, the people out in that sec
tion have received no indication as
to whether the holders of the op
tions will make any attempt to have
them extended.
A big deal, In fact the biggest land
deal in years, would not come as a
surprise during the next few days
nhould the company decide to close
on the options.
Oddfellows and
Rebekahs Picnic
The Oddfellows and Rebekahs will
"have a picnic in Lithia park at 6
p. m., on Tuesday, August 29. All
are requested to bring cups and
epoons. Coffee, cream and sugar

Folowing the program there will
te a dance and program at Oddfel
low's hall, for the lodge members

Orvllle Gaines has returned after
.three or four months absence at
Portland and Seattle.

Amos Dahuff, of this city, has re
ceived word that Mark W. Weather
ford, Democratic and Prohibition
party nominee tor representative in
congress, will be in Jackson county
on August 28, and will likely address
a gathering at Ashland while visit

Definite announcements will be

Democrats of the city are making ar
rangements today preliminary to hav
ing Mr. Weatherford speak here.
With him will be 0. V. White,
chairman of the Linn County Central
Prohibition committee and possibly
Mrs. Weatherford and Mrs. White.

of the Choral Club concert at the
Vining theatre, which begins at 8:30.
This change Is made for next Wed
nesday only. The Sunday concert
will be held at the usual hour of
3 p. m.
Roadmaster
Gets Promotion
G. W. Corrigan, roadmaster for the
Shasta division from Dunsmuir to:
Ashland, with headquarters at Horn- j
brook, has been promoted to the po-1
8itlon of division engineer of the J
Sacramento division. Mr. Corrigan
is very well thought of by both the
men and the higher-ups on the Shas
ta division, and his promotion is
conceded to be deserved. His suc
cessor has not been named.
Shasta Division
Has Mallet Engine
The first Mallet type of engine has
been put to work on the Shasta di
vision and is running in the through
freight service, Gerber to Dunsmuir,
and the helper service between Duns
muir and Weed. The monster en
gine with cab in front, does the work ,
of two of the ordinary Mikado or
3200 type. The new engine weighs!
in the neighborhood of 380,000
pounds on the drivers, while the Ml-
kados, the largest type used on the j
heavy mountain hauls heretofore,
weigh between 206,000 and 210,000
pounds.
The new engine is the first of
its kind on the Southern Pacific
north of Sacramento but it is under
stood will be followed by three oth
ers to be used on the same run. The
engine is used from Gerber to Weed
where it is turned on the "Y".
Sometimes it is backed up to Edge
wood, five miles north of Weed, and
used as a helper over the hill from
there to Weed. It is Impossible to
use the Mallet over the Siskiyou
mountains between Hornbrook and
Ashland because of the curves, the
most impossible of which is the 14
degrees curve tunnel on this side of
the mountain. The Mallet cannot be
handled on any of the turntables,
either at Hornbrook or at Dunsmuir
hence is used from Gerber, the new
division point near Red Bluff, to
Weed, both of which are equipped
with "Y" switches.
The engine was brought up from
the Sacramento division point a few
days ago and was the object of much
curiosity. It is not exactly wel
comed by enginemen, however, ' as
the Mallet, with a crew of engineer
and fireman, can do the work of two
of the 2600 or 3200 engines, thus
naturally putting one crew out of
commission. Traveling Engineer
Keenan of the Sacramento division
brought the Mallet to Dunsmuir and
instructed the engineers there in
handling it.
Mrs. Lulu Van Wegen returned
home Sunday after a pleasant visit
of several days with an old school
mate, Mrs. M. E. Owens of Central
Point. As Mrs. Owens is the owner
of a Ford, they had lots of nice rides
and visited old friends and neighbors,
also attending the Central Point
church where Mrs. Van Wegen had
not been since she was a girl. Mrs.
Owens and daughter, Virgie, accom
panied her home and stayed to enjoy
the concert at Lithia park.
Have a Good Time Kids, School
Starts Monday, September 4th
Better get up early In the morn
ing, kids, and go swimming every
day if not twice a day for these next
ten days. Better go barefooted all
the time, you will soon have to wear
shoes. School starts Monday, Sep
tember 4. It is hard on the kids,
too, we really are just beginning to
have the kind of summer boys like.
This year Ashland is to have an
innovation, the Junior high school.
This will really not make a very
great change in the schools which are
attended, what have formerly been
called sub-freshmen, remaining in
the West school instead of going to
the high school. The regular freah
men go to the high school. The
Junior high school takes practically
the same work as the 7th, 8th and
9th grades did heretofore, but are
taught on the high school principle,
a teacher for each subject, instead
of having one teacher to the grade
as heretofore. Instead of remaining
in one room all the time the stud
ents at the junior school will have
their class rooms as do the high
schoolers and an assembly hall.
Superintendent Briscoe has issued
the following instruction which
should be read carefully by every
parent of a boy or girl of school age:
Grades 7B, 7A, 8B, 8A and 9B
will' attend the Junior high school
at the West Side building. The 94.
10B, 10A, 11B, 11A and 12B wi'l
attend at the senior high or the
high school building.
An attempt will be made to es
tablish the dividing line for grades
one to six inclusive at First street.
Those living on the eaBt side of Firsi
street for the first six grades will go
to the East school, while those liv
ing on the west side of First street
will go to the West building. Should
some grade or grades in either school
be crowded and accommodation in
that grade or those gTades afforded
In the other school, it will be neces
sary to readjust by sending those
nearest the accommodations to that
school. Every effort will te made
to offer the most satisfactory condi
tions to the pupils of the lower
grades.
State texts may be secured at the
McNair Drug stores. Paint;, pencils,
penholders, notebooks, etc., may be
obtained from any dealers handling
them.
At the high school bull.iing on
Thursday, August 31, 1910. begin
ning at 8 a. m., examinations for
grades 5, 6. 7 and 8 will be held.
Friday, September 1, 1916, exam
inations for grades 9, 10, 11 and 12
will be held at the same place, be
ginning at 8 a. m. All tht week be
ginning August 28, 1916, the super
intendent of schools will be in his
office at the high school building
from 8 till 12, and from 1 till 5.
Pupils who have never been in the
Ashland schools should call upon him
during this week for assignments to
grades and buildings.
First year pupilB that is begin
ners may enter the grade school lo
cated in their district if they will
be six years old by October 10, 1916.
