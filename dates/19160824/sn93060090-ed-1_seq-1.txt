And again we hear it said, that
it was necessary to use the
sword in order to establish the
gospel. We whall giye you an
example of this. At, the time
whenBi&btfp Severys went to
pebato with Tbeodoolus the Jew
Rabl. iLslead of fulfilling his
er'and in debating he with his
army, over powared tho Jews
and destroyed their temples,
which temples God had given
them: For the Jew, as we hare
proven, was under the law of
circumcision.. And after this
Bishop had robbud and plunder
ed and murdered man. woman
and infants to f bis satisfaction,
then be makes the. pretention of
hiring the Jew Rabi to preach
his (the Bishop's) gospel; or in
other words, you might say
forced the Jew Rabl, to become
what they called a christian
And thousands upon thousands
of such pictures could be print'
ed and put before your eyes,
which they would have you be
lieve, that Christianity must rest
her defense on. Is not this
enough to make any honest heart
droop in sorrow and sadness
and ask the question, from
whence comes wars and fight ings
among them? Then listen
for the answer. Does not Christ
say they come of your own lusts?
Yes. For the flesh lusteth a
gainst the Spirit, for Christ said
Love ore anotner, love your
neighbors, yea even love your
enemies: for He saith love work
eth no ill to his neighbor; and
that there is no fear in love, for
fear is torment, and perfect love
casteth out all fear : for God is
love. No room in such teachings
for bloodshed, rapine and
revenge.
Yes. it is true, His followers
must be gentle, and iive in peace
with all men, and they must love
each " other as they have loved
themselves for the love of Christ
in them worketh no ill to their
fellowmen, and ' the same love
stands persecution by its enemy
And from this pure God like
picture of Jesus, we are enable
to plainly sue : that instead of
Christianity resting its defeuce
upon the depredations of the
cruel ages of. thu past, which
has done the outrageous conduct
of the beast.--. It: ivsts kt de
fonce in this lap of love, its confi
dence in mercy, and its hope in

rs being made perfect by suffer"
ing, that human progress was
made manifest, and it was by
and through the tove of God in
Christ and His disciples, that
progress was elevated beyond
all human expectation, or appre
hension. '
And upon these grounds, the
great battle was fought, Chris
tianity prevailed, and progress
was established upon the blood
bought banner f Christianity
And satan's plan of boldidg
the world under thu yoke of
tyrany and oppression was
defeated.
And as we bold up to view

that the world was and shall be
turned from barbarism and di
gression, into civilization and
progress by christian perfection
And appearently as a lamb,
the lion or wolf comes forth
in sheep s clothing, and as a
serpent coiled up in the cloak
of peace, he now takes up his
position in the midst of God's
children, in the false prophet.
or second beast, or the harlot,
and in this attitude licks God's
children in the facs so that he
may get the oppertunity to
stab them in the heart; with
his venom Inoxious posion of
pernicious teachings.
And it is thru this channel
that all false religions have
arose; men thru their sins and
godless pride have removed them
selves away from God and the
restraints of religlon'and become
addicted to vice and impurity
and the most Holy God gives
them over to their own licen
tuousness. And tbey worship the
creature more than the Creator.
And for fear that there may be
some roora lor ciouotasio
where the true church is to be
found, we shall say to you, that
the scripture teaches us that
the Church of Christ and His
kingdom are set up in the hearts
of His true followers: and it
does not matter where they are;
tnere is where you will find tho
teligion of the Lord Jesus
Christ.
A' religion that acknowledges
a crucified Saviour, A religion
which crucifies . the flesh with
all its lusts,
A religion that commands us
to lovfc our enemies- oar
brethren and our neighbors-
A religion and Church of Christ.

union which Christ so earnestly

in preaching, in praying, and in
the Spirit of the same mind. And-
when you find such a religion,
you then will find the church
that is free from malice, hatred"
and superstition; and the church.
which is free in its noble man
hood; and furthermore you then-
will find the church that is broad-
in its soul saving power and
endurance of hope but not broad
in oppression and strife; broadV
by the presence of God and not-
broad by His abjence: not broad

beauty to welcome all to its
bosom that wiU heed the plead
ings of Christ. "Come- unto me
all ye that labor, and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest."
And now if we have the oppor
tunity, let us meditate well upon
these things, for the precept, to
love God, is the first and most
essential of all commandments;,
and love is fulfilling of the whole
law, It is necessary then for us.
to weigh thw well, And hereafter
let us imitate this as far as im
possible, just what the saints are
doing in heaven, and what we
hope to do in eternity; that is,,
let us love God with all our
heart, soul, body, mind, and?
strength, and our neighbors as
ourselves. It may be that
heretofore we have not done this
as we ought or as was our duty
to God.
We trust that every reader ia
this work will Bee the truths of
the Holy Bible. And to every
one both old and young as we
assure you. that this work is not
r-f man, but of the kind
providence of the living God.
Read it. and you will find th&
pure gems of Eternal Thought,
It is no system of fabulous
doctrine: Its foundation Is the
Bible, and in every reader offers
a reward; and every reward is-
his crown. Not only will it lead
him to the truth in this life, but
beyond the dismal tomb, he will
realize himself to have been in
the highest degrte forwarded
and benefited by the priviledge
of drinking in the sweets of
those never ending truths and
to be an heir of God and a joint
beir with Christ, forever an&
ever. Amen.
