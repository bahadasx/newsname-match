Wilson and Bail Heads Meet at 12:30
o'clock Agreement May Be
Beached.
JUDGE CHAMBERS MEETS
WITH BB0THEBH00DS
Bail Men Attempting to Find a
Solution to Eight-Hour Day
Bequested.
(By United Press)
Washington, Aug. 24.The rail
ways are yielding to President Wil
son on an eight-hour day. But the
rail presidents are struggling des
perately in the attempt to find an
eight-hour day that is not what the
employes demanded.
It is reported that the presidents
are willing to grant: First, the
eight-hour day with pay at the pres
ent rates, and second, overtime on the
present rates or arbitration of the
overtime question. They won't con
cede an eight-hour day for the same
wage of the present ten-hour day.
Judge in Conference.
Judge Chambers of the Federal
Board of Mediation and oCnciliation
conferred with President Wilson this
morning. Later he conferred with
the brotherhood men. The purposes
of his conferences are not known.
President Wilson and the railway
presidents met again at 12:30 o'clock
this noon, following Chambers' return
from a conference with the brother
hood men.
It is believed that some satisfactory
action will be reached this afternoon
Hold Conference.
In another effort to aid the presi
dents of the country's railroads to
find some way in which to accept an
eight-hour day for their trainnaen
and evert the threatened strike,
President Wilson last
for an hour with Presidents Hale E|oJ
dr^of the Burlington, Daniel W/il
lard of the Baltimore &Ohio and
3. Lovett of the Union Pacific.
Neither White House officials nor
the presidents would discuss the con
ference. It was said on authority,
however, that the three executives
went to the White House to receive
an answer to the suggestion they
made to Mr. Wilson and that he give
them more specific information as to
how the railroads may get the addi
tional revenue necessary to take care
of the greater pay rolls that will come
with the eight-hour day.
May Accept Flan.
It became evident today that
most of the railroad executives have
come to believe that there can be
only one way of preventing a strike
and that is by accepting the eight
hour plan. The chief effort in their
own conferences was to find some
scheme by which an eight-hour day
may be put in operation on all the
railroads at the least added expense.
Many suggestions along this line have
been made by the president, but not
one of them has proved feasible when
submitted to the acid test of operat
ing officials.
Hill Makes Statement.
Lou*s W Hill, president of the
Great Northern railway, and one of
the strongest opponents of the eight
hour day, declared in a statement
given out that many western roads
in particular would have scant earn
ings next year and that many would
be forced into receivership by an
eight-hour wage basis.
"This is a time when, instead of be
ing burdened with useless and un
called for expenses, such as are de
manded by the brotherhoods the rail
roads should receive every encour
agement in order to meet the needs of
the country," he said. "Such an ex
tra burden as is contemplated by this
eight-hour demand would not only
cut off all possibility of dividends
and extensions, but throw a number
of western roads into receiverships."

PIONEER AD CAUSES
BUN ON LAMB SUPPLY
That the advertisements In
the Bemidji Pioneer are read
carefully each day was shown
yesterday when an advertise
ment of the Palace Meat Mar
ket, advertising "Leg of
Lamb," was run over the
name of the City Drug store.
The result was that nearly
100 telephone calls were re
ceived for this product.
"We could have sold out
an ordinary meat market sup-
ply," said Willaim Laliberte
of the City Drug store. "It
was continuously called for
throughout the day, both over
the telephone and by persons
coming into the store."
We owe an apology to the
Palace Meat Market and ask
the pardon of the City Drug
store. Both concerns are reg
ular advertisers in the Pio
neer.

Des Moines, la., Aug. 24.
Two "beer" hounds yesterday
trailed their first bootlegger
to his lair in this city. From
"deer" hounds to "beer"
hounds has been the expert

of blindpiggers and moon
shiners. Crossed between
deer hounds and blood hounds
the animals were easily
taught to follow beer and
whisky scents. The- hounds,
given a whiff of beer, led the
way to a house suspected for
some time. The police found
20 gallons of beer and six

MEXICAN TROOPS
MAY BE WITHDRAWN
Washington, Aug. 24.There were
two developments yesterday in the
Mexican situation. Secretary Lan
sing and Elisio Arredondo, Mexican
ambassador designate, tentatively
agreed that the joint commission to
discuss border problems should meet
at some place on the New England
coast during the first week of Sep
tember. Brigadier General Pershing
transmitted a report saying that the
general opinion was that "Villa
prestige is gone and that he can never
again become a serious factor in Mex
ican affairs."
Supporting, as it does, General
Funston's recent recommendation
for the withdrawal of the expedition
ary force in Mexico, it is believed
General Pershing's report makes it
certain that the American commis
sioners will agree promptly to the
suggestion of the Mexican conferees
for the early recall of the troops.
