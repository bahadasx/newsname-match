Sheriff Swords'
Slaver Captured.
Lake Charles, La., Aug. 17.- D
Trapped by a posse of Lake
Charles and Kinder officials, ui
headed by Sheriff Heny Reid of w
Calcasieu parish, and taken into bi
custody about 2 o'clock this he
morning in the swamp near the in
Old Putunam Mill, Hilaire Car- li
riere, slayer of Sheriff Marion m
Swords of St. Landry parish, to
night is dying in the parish jail of
of his wounds received near di
Basile. oi
Lake Charles, La. Aug. 18.- of
The condition of Hiliare Carriere, tL
the wounded outlaw in jail here, to
continues to improve hourly, and
his recovery now seems practical- c:
ly assured. At noon today at. ul
tending physicians announced g,
that he appeared to be out of cl
danger. Unless unexpected pi
complications set in Carriere in
probably will be in a condition to b,
stand trial for one of three kill- o0
ings he is charged with in a very w
few weeks.. al
The Fifteenth Judicial district g
has a prior claim to the outlaw d(
for a murder committed in Jeff tip
Davis pnrish several months ago.
Accordingly the two district ti
judges here, and the district a t- d
torney, have absolute control B
over Carriere, who was appre- h,
hended by Calcasieu parish offi- w
cials, and in the judicial district a
where the first killing occurred.
This places the officials in a po. t
sition to see that Carriere obtains b:
a fair trial, as they can insist on m
trying him first. fr
With Carriere's story of the
killing of Sheriff Swords as told
to the latter's son, Mierrick, a de
tailed account of the tragedy is
for the first time available, As
pieced together it is as follows: w
At daybreak on July 17,. Car -
riera left a cabin in the Mallet
woods, where he had spent the fc
night. A few hours previously ai
the place had been surrounded
without his knowledge. Charles
Chaccere, posted by the gate, ap- fE
peared to have shifted his posi
tion to a clump of trees nearby. a(
As Carriere walked toward the
trees some one shouted at him
and then fired. He fired back in
stantly and heard his bullet strike
a rifle barrel. This bullet glanced
offand struck Chaohere in the "
face, eliminating him. b
Carriere then ran across a cot
ton field toward a three.acre corn P
patch. The field was open, and he "
was under fire for a distance of
150 yards, but in the uncertain e
light the bullets missed their
mark. He concealed himself in
the cornfield. It was gradually
getting lighter.
Swords and two negro assist
ants advanced on the corn field.
Swords called Chachere repeated
ly, but the latter did not answer.
The sheriff then became much ex
cited. The negroes wanted him
to wait and send for assistance,
but he refused. Under compul
ion they entered the corn field
with him. He was in the center,
with a man on each side.
From his place of concealment
Carriere picked off the two neg
roes first, and then took a snap
shot at the sheriff. The latter
was instantly killed. Having
disposed of four men the ontlaw
promptly fled, Carriere insists
that when he left the cabin and
was fired on he thought some of
the negroes of the neighborhood
were after him. He states that
he did not identify the sheriff be
fore he killed him.

Earl Babet that the American

Sunny lHill, La., Aug. 21.
Dear Era-Leader:
It is with pleas
ure that we look forward to your a
weekly visits, with words s, tl
bright and cheerful, alwvays up- '
holding the right and condemn- b
ing the wrong. Long nmay you
live to tell the tale of christian e
morality and love to Our people. v
We folks around the old post a
office of Sunny lHill are still plod
ding along in the even tenor 'f tl
our way. All is well, we, like
other communities have many tl
things to make us glad and bonm
to make us sad.
The crops are good with the ex
ception of cotton which is a fail
ure. Health in a general way is
good for the time of year. Our
church and our school seem to be
prospering. Our protracted
meeting at the church here which Z
began on 30th of .July and ended a
on Aug, 6th, by the help of God fl
was a great success, having large s.
attentive and well behaved con
gregations. Seventeen were ad- k
ded to the church. Ten by Bap- f,
tism and seven by letter, Bro.
W. F. Hutson the pastor did all
the preaching except on the last
day and night when our young
Bro. Joe Bateman of your town
helped him. The saddest feature
was, that our old friend and
neighbor, Slidell Richardson,
paised away about the close of t
this meeting. We loved Slidell I;
because he was a true and honest o
man; we have lost two noble men ii
from our midst this season.
As to ourahool we are glad to
say the propects are very eun
odoragitig. Orie -Bk of ou.t
present session has passed with C
an enrollment of 156 pupils and c
we hear of many more that are
coming. We have six teachers,
all of whom seem to be striving t
for the success of the school. We I
are glad to note that perfect har
mony prevails among the teachers
and also the pupils, and while dif.
ferent religious denominations
are represented on our teaching
force and also among the patrons
we allow no prejudices to prevaill
and all work together for the com
mon good.
We look on all the great things
we thus enjoy not with pride or
boasting but with gratitude to the
people who have given us their
patronage, and the able friends
whoso often have visited and
helped us with strong words of
encouragement. And above all
else we are gratefulto the Great
Giver of all good. May His bless.
ings ever be with us and all His
people. Good-Bye.
Uncle Leslie.

He w~asn't stingy-he was careful. He knew that all
