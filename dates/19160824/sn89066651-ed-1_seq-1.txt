One clay last week while our

was noticed that evening to be
about the horses and the finest

Mexicans are a pretty good judge
of live stock. The officers get

location of the animal, but the
Mexican visited again 1 hut night
and succeeded in his undertak

on his beat the Mexican gr.iblx d

Help Our Churches.
Wo dislike to call the attention
of the people of Hayti and others
that the linancos of the churches
of Hayti are in very bad condi
tion. It is a burning shame that
the members of two of the
churches and the people- of Hayti
in general let the pastors go from
month to month without paying
them.
Your debt to the pastor should
be paid just as well and as
promptly as you would pay your
grocer. The conference year is
almost gone and the pastors arc
only a few dollar half paid for
the. years' work. Really aren't
you members ashamed to let
your pastor go without funds in
this manner.
If matters as they are in Hayti
with the Haptist and Methodist
churches continue to exist, it will
only be a short time before Hayti
will have an old-time circuit rider
parson. When a city forgets his
God so much as to forgot to sup
port the church there is surely
something going to happen- For
ourselves, we wouldn't like to live
in any town without a church
and its inllucnces.
The pastors of the above named
churches do not know that we
intended this article, but we
do know that they are in strained
circumstances, and we believe
they are worthy of their hire.
I'ay them or don't promise to do
so.
There should bean effort made
to correct this shortcoming, or
else we may look for a circuit
rider soon. Ileally, that's about
all we deserve -it seems.

SCHOOL NOTES.
By V. H JOHNSON, Sjpnn!edonl
The term of 1010 17 opens
Monday, September !. Every
year for the last four has seen a
larger enrollment than the one
just previous, and the prospect
now is for a larger attendance
than ever before.
This year we will have ten
teachers, one more than we had
la.st year; every room in the
building will be occupied for the
first time .since the erection ol
the addition to the building in
1012. We will also have fret
text books in all the grades be
low the high school. In addition
to the purchase of additional
books the Hoard of Education
has put in some very nice globes
for geography work, the library
being fitted up with an extra
large one mounted on a very
beautiful stand. Now seats and
other nccessarv equipment have
been provided. So we can still
say that we are better equipped
than ever before for school work.
Last year our high school en
rollment nearly doubled the pre
vious year's enrollment. This
year, in spite of the fact that our
eighth grade class of last year
was small, and that the rural
schools taught only seventh
year's work and did not turn out
any graduates, our enrollment
in the high will still show a sub
stantial increase over last year.
All high school books will have
to bo ordered after it is ascer
tained what course each high
school student desires to pursue
For that reason J will ask that
ui'ery one who wishes to take
high .school work all the high
school students meet at the
.school building Monday fore
noon, August 2s, at'.) o'clock and,
make out your program. Then
your books will be ordered so
that they may he here in due
time. Do not purchase any high
school books before enrollment
il.iy, as some changes in texts
will be made.

A WUI!l TO Ofl! I'ATIfOWS,
Wo as your teachers welcome
the approach of another school

which is so lull of possibilities
to all concei nod. Ve are not be

liei.ii.ilii)ii lor t. l. which we
expect to confront us during the
.term, but wo realize that this
preparation will not do all for
we will need the help of every
patron oftliu school.
I shall list some of the things
here, wo, as patrons, may do to
help miilio the school a success

1. Visit school often, thus en

SWEET POTATO BLOOM.
JohnXunn, one of the foremen
for the Alfalfa Farming Co.,
brought to this office Monday
morning a sweet potato bloom
of the Nancy Hull variety. This
is the tirst time we have ever
seen a sweet potato bloom. It
is said these blooms are rare and
are seen only once in a great
while.
ing yourself in touch, at first
hand, with what the school is at
tempting to do. By these visits
you will see the tasks before the
class room teacher and will
naturally bo in sympathy with
the work she is trying to accom
plish. J. Start your children to
school the tirst day and keep
them in attendance regularly
throughout the school year. The
influence of the school will be
valuable to your boy or girl in
in'ojortimi toJJieiratUendanco.
I! The re-organization of our
Parent Teachers' associa t i o n .
This organization is one of the
greatest auxiliaries a school can
have. Let's organize this associa
turn during the early part of the
term and have meetings at least
once each month. Great good
can come of this.
I. By co operating with the
School Board in the enforcement
of the compulsory school law.
With all the books furnished in
the grades as our district is do
ing it seems to me there is
scarcely a reason why all the
children of school age should not
a'.ieiui. You may talk about our
line soil, the oil prospect and our
great future in a material way.
but it is clear to me that our
greatest asset is our boys and
girls. If they are to be worth
the most to their country they
must be educated.
."). Discourage idleness among
the children. A child needs
play, it is essential to his proper
development; that is why we
