Fraud Alleged In White
Earth Case Brief Filed
By Federal Attorneys.
Francis J. Kearful, special as
sistant to the United States attorn
ey general, and Leslie O. Garnet,
associate counsel, today filed a
brief for the September term of
the United States circflit court of
appeal* in the case of the United
States against Lucky S. Waller
and Mamie S. Waller, involving
purchase of White Earth Indian
lands after tne passage of the Oapp
amendment.
The case is typical of the many
recently settled by agreement be
tween Franklin K. Lane, secretary
of the* interior, and R. J. Powell,
attorney for the land owners on
the White Earth reservation.
The government, in the brief as
filed, takes the position that not
withstanding the passage of the
Clapp amendment which gave the
Indians the* .right to sell their
lands, the incompetent Indians
still remained in a condition of
pupilage towards the government.
The case in point involved al
leged fraud in obtaining from two
Indians a land parcel valued at
$700 by having the Indians attest
a paper thought by them to be a
Receipt for $50 on part payment,
but which was in fact a warranty
deed for the land.Minneapolis

Finds Fault Because Res
olutions Committee Did
Not Favor Him.
Recently, the chairman of the
resolutions committee of the Be
midji General Council of Minneso
ta Chippewas, furnished Rev.
Frank Pequette, of Sawyer, Min
nesota, with a resolution James
Coffey had offered to the committee
attacking the rights of Mr. Pe
quette as a member of the Chip
pewa bands of Minnesota, and he
notified Mr. Coffey of this and in
formed him the resolution would
be returned to him by Mr. Pe
quette. To this act of the chair
man Mr. Coffey took exceptions
in a letter which is as follows, and
is published because it refers to
tribal business:
Coffey, Minnesota,
Aug. 1st, 1916.
-~Gus H. Beaulieu,
White Earth, Minn.
Dear Gus:
1 am pleased to advise you of
the receipt of your valued letter of
July lUth. I have been very busy
Gus, and have not opened it until
today, I am rather disappointed
that you failed in your duty as the
Chairman of the most important
committee of the council, the eono
/mittee on resolutions, to properly
present all of the resolutions acted
upon by the committee, this reso
lution which you return to me en
closed with your letter, directing
the president of the general coun-
cil to consult with the Indian office
regarding the distribution of the
one-fourth of the general funds of
the Chippewas, with the object of
ipplying the rule upon this appro
priation, followed by the Indian
Office in making the annual dis
oursement of the interest of the
principal funds of the Chippewas.
of making one payment after the
death of a member of said Indian
tribe.
This resolution was intended as
a measure of precaution, and to
secure a uniform rule in the dis
bursements of the Chippewa funds,
if thp rule is not followed by the
Indian Office in making this dis
bursement, and the recent deaths
are not provided for as in the past,
in the nature of a reimbursement
for the care and expenses in the
last illness and funeral expenses of
the deceased, the loss to the party
who advanced the necessary ex
penses, may be the direct result of
your negligence and carelessness
in your duties as the Chairman of
the committee on resolutions in
failing to present the resolutions
acted upon by that committee, this
matter will be reported to the
president of the General council as
a guide for future action in his
selection of dependable and com
petent men for that committee.
I must say that I commend your
action in your attempt to protect
Mr. Frank Piquette in the attack
upon the method under which he
has been placed upon the Rolls of
the Nett Lake Reservation, I com
mend it because, I have been told
that he is a good friend of yours,
*d that in'Washington he fitted
into your wheel like a cog, it does
not matter to you how he was en
tered upon the rolls of the Chip
pewas of Minnesota, so long as he
can fit like a cog in a wheel that
you want to turn therefore it
must be assumed that you want to
see he gets fair play in the investi
gation looking into the legality
and legitimacy of his enrollment
on the Nett Lake Reservation.
But there is another view to take
of the matter Gus and this is the
fact that you were a delegate from
the White Earth Reservation,
elected for the purpose of protect
ing the general interests of all the
Chippewas of Minnesota, and when
you undertake to protect any per
son or persons, upon your own
volition, yourowo initiative, who
are not Minnesota Chippewas and
do not pretend to have any claim
whatever as such, who are report
ed to have availed undue influence
upon Indians who are practically
ignorant, uneducated without prac
tical responsibility to obtain a re
sult which will place upon them
selves all of the financial and pro
perty benefits to which a Minne
sota Chippewa is entitled, is in di
rect violation of the trust imposed
upon you as a delegate to the gen
eral council in which you are ex
pected to exercise the greatest
caution in protection of the inter
ests of those who elected you a
delegate and sent you to the Gen
eral Council, you know Gus, that
as a matter of LAW even though
there had been a legal council and
well represented, upon any one
reservation, for instance the Nett
Lake Reservation in an attempt to
place this man Frank Piquette up
on the rolls of Minnesota, is not
sufficient to bind the entire band
of Chippewas in Minnesota, the
policy persued by the government
heretofore, where the common
property of the Chippewas was in
volved, was to secure the consent
of the councils of each and every
one of the Reservations in Minne
sota, interested.

Reservation has no more right, or
authority to make a donation to
Frank Piquette or any other per
son of a part of the general funds
belonging to the Chippewas in
Minnesota in general nor the lands
thereof, than any one state would
have a right or authority to make
a grant to any person of any por
tion of the public treasury of the
United States or any portion of
the public domain, without con
gressional concurrence.
Without the concurrent action
of the rest of the councils the In
dians of the State of Minnesota, in
that respect I claim that Frank
Piquette has been illegally paid
any of the Chippewa funds of
Minnesota, that he may have re
ceived on account of his enrollment
upon the Nett Lake Reservation,
and congress was without moral
authority in granting him the land
he is reported to have received a
patent therefore on the Nett Lake
Reservation, in fact the transaction
has the appearance of a high hand
ed affair over and above the heads
of all the Chippewas of Minneso
ta, Now Gus, this is the appear
ance of the transaction which you
have placed yourself on record as
protecting.
Of course we want Piquette to
know that we believe he has no
right to be on the Rolls of the
Chippewas of Minnesota, and there
will be an effort to correct this
apparent monstrosity, and he will
be called upon to answer for him
self upon an investigation of the
matter, although he did not call
upon all the Chippewas oLMinne*
sota or their representatives to
witness the transaction oy which
he is said to have engineered him
self upon the rolls of the Nett
Lake reservation, for it is said that
he was present at the allpged coun
cil and directed the proceedings
there or acted at the council in his
behalf.
I wish also to Commend your
dependency as a committeeman, on
the committee on resolutions, your
conduct in the case of the first
draft of the resolution in the Frank
Piquette case, develops the fact
that, so far as you are concerned,
there is no such a thing as a zone
of confidential harmony in the
work of the committee in public
matters for the public good, that
is, no sense of honor, nor even a
gentleman's confidence in the dis
cussion of public subjects, else
you would have abided your time
and allowed the committee to no
tify Mr. Frank Piquette of the
action in his case, instead of rush
ing the rough draft of the resolu
tion in the case of Frank Piquette
to him, while it was intrusted in'
your care only by the committee
to report to the council, which you
failed to do.
Even tho, that I had never hpard
a word against you Gus, those
things above enumerated, and
which you have confessed in ad
vance would form a strong basis
in forming an opinion of wilful
violation of a public trust.
You know Gus, that God, the
grantor of all things that are
good, in his infinite wisdom, from
me with held the gift of lucidity,
therefore 1 employ quite pointed
ly such expressions as my sincer
ity prompts, and beg of you not to
take personal offense, because I
entertain no personal enmity to
wards you, those critism are taken
from a public duty point of view
only and no further.
Referingto the Bemidji Council,
I certainly carry no sores over the
result, while I entertain only pro
found admiration for the persis
tency and what some people may
call gall, in which you fought for

the objects you contended, but the
results merited pity in the waste
of suoh gallant efforts for objects
possessing no merit, and it was
notedly evident that the conven
tion was delighted to see your
feet touch th-i ground at the end
of each struggle.
We do not expect any such
struggles next year Gus, because
this council passed resolutions pur
posely to avoid recurrence of those
matters, as I stated at the council,
the Indians ideals are as near
socialism as can be made, the in
terests of our people no matter
what reservation tbey live on, are
equal, and there should be no dis
crimination, there should be no
political matter injected into it,
nor anything having the color of
politics, I believe the great major
ity of the Chippewas of Minneso
ta take this view, and this will
form the basis of getting rid of
any Organized influences or
schemes to promote objects tend
ing to produce certain benefits to
further the ends of any schemers,
if those .show up next year they
will be exposed and denounced
openly upon the floor, the village
of White Earth contains a very
few hundred people, you know
how many, you will be able to
elect delegates to the extent of the
population in that village, and so
on, tho restof tho villages through
out the reservation will elect their
delegates from their villages or
communities, this will equalize the
distribution of delegates through
out the reservation and you will
not be able to select a solid dele
gation from the village of White
Earth alone as you have hereto
fore apparently been doing, this
was intended to, and will break

Let us hear from you again Gus.
Sincerely yours,
James J. Coffey.
In his reply to the Coffey letter
the publisher was of necessity
obliged to answer at some length
in order to point out to him his in
consistancies and narrow preju
dices, and as this reply would takt
up too much space it is referred to
and quoted only briefly in chronogi
cal order.
1st. Mr. Coffey's attention i.-
called to the fact that he carrieo
the resoultions two nights and
more than one day in his pocket
before they were finally reported,
and if there were any such errors
as he now claims, ordisorepencies.
he should have called the council's
attention to them at the time they
were read.
2nd. One of the resolutions thi.t
was returned to him and which
was not acted upon by the resolu
tions committee, was a matter with
which he had some correspondence
with the Indian office at Washing
ton in relation to the payment of
persons from the one-fourth
amount of Chippewa tribal funds,
who had died within one year.
The publisher of TIIK TOMAHAWK
was the chairman of the commit
tee and in reply to Mr. Coffey's
letter regarding this matter in part
says: "You no doubt gave goods
on credit to Indians now deceased,
and if the latter were to receive a
per capita share of the big pay
ment which is about to be made,
you might receive your pay from
the amount, otherwise the debt
would remain on your books un
paid indefinitely."
Mr. Coffey's attention isfurthei
I his store is something more than just a place where goods are for sale.
We aim to make it render a real service in the community, through tho
handling of reliable goods only, a strict guarantee on everything sold, low
prices and kindly, courteous treatment.

callel to the fact that thi is pure-
\y a personal matter with him. and
he could not have expected the
council to be interested in it.
3rd. The replyalsostatesthat.it.
is evident that Rev. Frank Pe
quette is the whole cause of Mr.
Coffey's belligerency, because the
frme has ursurped his in
fluence with the Indians upon
the reservation to which he be
longs, the Fond du Lac reserva
tion.
Reference is iiade to the work
of Rev. Frank Pequette on behalf
of the members of the Fond du
Lac and Nett Lake reservations hi
this way: "He saw wherein the
members of your reservation need
ed assistance and he did what you
have never done, went to Wash
ington, and put up money for ex
penses for this purpose, and got
legislation for them. You have re
mained at home and barked at
everything that has been under
taken for the Chippewas of Minne
sota in Congress, or before the de
partments, by representatives of
the tribe."
The publisher also says that he
is glad to be informed by Mr.
Coffey that Mr. Pequette is a
friend of tho former, but denies
that he has ever had any business
relations with him, and did not
even intrude any curiousity upon
him by trying to learn what his
business and that of Chief Mike
Diver was at Washington when Im
met them there ihat Mr. Pequette
is a man of integrity, and a minister
of good standing in tho church to
which he belongs, and adds: "I
would suggest that you compare
your work for the Chippewas with
his, and say to your fellow In-
