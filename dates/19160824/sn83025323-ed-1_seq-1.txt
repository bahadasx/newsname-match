Judge Utter's
Law of Murder
M~aking Vigorous Campaign on his Record
In M'~urder Cases in Sheridan County
When Judge Utter has to use
the 1.4 murder cases in Sheridan
county and the calling of grand jur
ies as political issues to conceal his
record for squandering the taxpay
ers' money, he virtually admits that
the law has not been enforced in this
district. His charge that Sheridan
county is a lawless community is false
Sheridan county has thousands of
splendid women and men, peers lin
good citizenship of any part of the
world. To characterize them as law
less si unwarranted.
It is not surprising that many
murders are committed in this dis
trict. The county attorneys com
plain that Judge Utter always tries
a case so that the defendant will be
acquitted. When a conviction is ,
secured the defendant is usually pa- I
roled, as was George Hibben, so that! ecnaanbcm eaet
the community, or the court usually
finds some pretended technicality'
upon which to turrn the defendants,
loose withoout trial, as was the case,
of the two defendants charged with I
robbing a wayfarer, but who had! 1
committed crimes in Great Falls;
and after Judge Utter turned them c
loose were taken there for trial and
convicted. c
In the Neuser murder case in f,
Sheridan county, Judge Utter told s,
the jury that a defendant was justi-' h
fled in using force and violence to S
the extent of taking human life, If D
necessary, "in preventing or at- 13
tempting to prevent a trespass or Ji
other unlawful Interference with di
real or personal property In his pos- hi
ses~iok.." What does this mean?
You are the owiier of real estate. A ol
takes possession of It. B walks si
;across It, tramping down the weeds, Jr
A rders him off, but he does not ht
obey the order. B, to prevent fur- pc
ther trespass kills A. Judge Utter Iyo

Lu oys that is not murder, he says B3
.fn bhotld be acquitted. What do you
r"- think about it?
is Another illustration: You loan
7- your neighbor a pitchfork. Some
it days later you send another neigh
Sbor for it. That neighbor, to pre
e vent the taking of the pitchfork
f back to you, shoots and kills the
[1person you sent for the pitchfork.
- Utter says that is not murder. What
does your common sense tell you?
The Supreme Court, many years
-ago, said :
- "It is well settled that a bare tres
Ipass against the property of another
is not sufficient provocntion to war
'rant the owner in using a deadly
weapon in its defense, and if he,
does so and with It kilil the tres
passer, it will be murder,"
Such erroneous instructions to
juries resulting in miscarriage of
justice easily account for the condi
tions of lawlessness which Judge:
lUtter says exists in his district. The
large number of cases of this charac
ter-crimes unpunished because the
court erroneously instructed the
jury. The people are told by the'
court that human blood may be shed
for a slight trespass to real or per
sonal property. Do you wonder there
have been' only 14 murder cases in
Sheridan county under such rule?
Do you feel that your life is perfect
ly safe under such conditions? If a
Judge Utter is elected he will "con-s
duct his court in the future as he
has in the past."a
If ,you believe In the enforcement .
of law as defined by the statutes and f
supreme court, you will vote against! ev
Judge, itttez. If.. ;'vu jP~exv .thaat a i n
human life may be taken' over the
possession of a ninety-cent pitchforki~
you will vote for Judge Utter. Ica.

HAZELBAKER HAS PLAN
TO ADVERT'ISE MONTA-N A
Within the next few weeks Frank I
I fazelbaker, secretary of the Moo-'']
tana Exposition Commission, will re
ceive the medals of award from the 1:
San Francisco Exposition Conimiss- c
io101, which were won by residents of c
Montana for agricultural and horti
cultural achievements in the history s
of the world. They were won by y
Montana at the greatest of all e
world's fairs, placing Montana su- v
I reworle vaoe eveyry other cutyi
tileword ad eeryother state in th
I this union in agricultural and hor- ti
ticultural pursuit.h
Montana should make more of; h
these great achievements than sim- b
ply distributing Promiscously the LI
medals among the various winners. t
While every winner of a medal will; x
prize it highly, yet few will know o
just who won the medals and why
they were won. i
Mr. Hazelbaker has thought of a C
plan that will enable everybody to bi
learn who the winning products P,
came from, and the advertising that ei
Montana wil receive from such a hii
plan will be manifold, 01
Mr. Hazelbaker plans to have a re
glass cabinet made that will contain re
each of the 730 medals. Each medal
will be labeled with the name of an
the man to whom it was presented, Sa
his address, the certain product that ja,
the mbedal waas awarded for, and
where the winning product was th
raised. This would Indeed be a yo
unique exhibit and would be on dis- wi
play at the capitol at all times The fin:
cabinet with Its precious contents chi
could be easily moved and could be pei
exhibited at all land shows, land ter
expositions and similar occasions
and would undoubtedly attract co
world-wide attention.
The co-operation of the winners
of the medals and all otohers Inter
ested In seeing Montana make the o
best of her awards at the San Fran-Ho
cisco world's fair is solicited by the
Montana Exposition Commission and
any suggestions that can be made to I
further such a movement or will im-in
prove such a plan will be appreciated, ins

N~EW PASTOR CORPUS CH{RISTI.
Announcemenst conies fronm Right
Rev. M. C. Lenihan, that the Rev.
Thomas Sheehy, assistant pastor of
St. Patrick's church, Billings, has .
been appointed rector of the Catholic '
cliurch i nthis city, and will assume
charge Sunday, August 27th.
The Rev. Father Pettit, who has
worked in this territory for four
years, will have charge of the church
es at Chinook, Harlem and Holland
ville, besides four missions.
Father Pettit regrets very much
ta thhe must sever his relationis with
the parishoners here, but the field
has beconme too extensive for one
priest and the need of separation has
been felt for souse time. Although
the retiring pastor will not visit Mal
ta so freequently as in the past he
will officiate occasionally in the place
of Father Sheehy.
Next Sunday, therefore, will be an
imnportant epoch in the history of
Corpus Christi parish and every mem
ber is urged to be present. Father
Pettit will celebrate the first mass at
eight o'clock and Father Sheehy the
high mass. The retiring pastor will
nmake announcemeists and add a few
remarks when the newly appointed
rector will map out his program.
Father Sheehy will reside in Malta
and will have charge of Dodson and
Savoy, besides all the territory ad
jacent thereto.
A nuptial mass will take place in
this church Monday at 8:30, when a
young couple from across the line
will be married. This will be the
First nuptal mass performed in this
:hurch for three years and It is ex
)ected that a large number will at
tend.

ilduff Store
Changes han~dS
J. F. Kilduff Sells his General Store in
M1alta to Senator John Survant
A deal closed late last week of
great importance to the people 01
Malta, was the one whereby Mr. Kil
dult disposes of his mercantile busi
ness and business blocks to Mr. Sur
cant. Mr. Kilduff has been a resident
of Malta for the past fourteen years
and during all that time has been
engaged in the mercantile bsuiness.
Irom his holdings it would be need
less to say that during his business
life in Malta the people have given
him a good business. He informed
us a day or so ago that during the
fourteen years of mercantile business
he had sold at retail something over
one million dollars worth of goods.
We are doubtful if there is another
town in the state of the size of Malta
that has a merchant that can show
that volume of business in the same
length of time.
Mr. Kilduff is undecided as to
what he will do, but at any rate he
and his estimable family intend to
make Malta their future home. In
losing good active merchant we will
not lose the family.
The purchaser, Mr. Survant, is one
of the pioneers of the county and it
is doubtful if there is a man in east
ern Montana that enjoys a larger ac
quaintance. He has been a resident
of this section of the country forj
the past twenty-five years and for
twenty years he has been engaged
In the mercantile business on the
north side of the track where the
Malta Mercantile store now stands.
He has been one of the prominent
figures in the industrial growth of
Malta and if there is a man in the
state that is loyal to his home town
it is John Survant.
It is his intention as soon as the
inventory is completed to take t
charge of the Kilduff store under the e
name of the Malta Mercantile Co.,
and use what is now their store
rooms for a warehouse. Mr. Sur
vant will make the change to the P
so nuth side if the track with some lit- r(
little regret as he has seen practi
cally all the business of the town on
that side and has seen the town grow M
and expand until three years ago 's(
everything mostly moved to the south se
side. Twenty years in one place of ac
business forms certain ties that are e',
lard to break. m
