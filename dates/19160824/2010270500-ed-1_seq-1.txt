a letter which Ed T. Kearney, of the
Mid-West bank, has received from
C. W. Mead, cashier of the Maakell
State bank at Maskell, Nebr. Mr.
Mead says the only danger is" an
early frost and this is not expected
this year. The harvest of small
grain has exceeded the expectations
of farmers in that section of Ne
braska, the yield of oats, in which
there was a large acreage, being
especially gratifying. The yield of
oats has ranged from forty to sixty
bushels to the acre and the quality
is better than for several years.
Much of the alfalfa has been har
vested and already is in the stack.

Annual Session of Insti- s
tune Convenes Monday
WILFRED E. VOSS, SUPT,
The Dakota County Teachers' In
stitute will convene in the Public
School building in Dakota City, Ne
braska, Monday, Augnst 28th, 191G,
at 9 o'clock a. m., and continue in
session for five days. This week
was chosen because it seems to be
the best one for institute purposes.
It conflicts in no way with the
teachers' attending their respective
summer schools, nor does it offer an
untimely hindrance to extra profes
sional employment, or to the pur
suit ot recreation and pleasure, dur
ing the time between school years.
On the other hand, this week is late
enough in the season so that all
teachers will be ready to seek new
methods, inspiration and suggestions
appropriate to the particular schools
they are to teach this coming year.
INSTRUCTORS
Prof. M. C. Lefler of the Teachers'
Training Department of the Peru
State Normal will deal with matter
concerning the intermediate and the
grammar grades.
Miss Carrie A. Beck of South Sioux
City will have charge of the primary
work in particular, and some inter
mediate grade subject matter.
Mr. A. H. Beckhoff, Dakota Coun
ty's Agricultural Agent, will give a
talk on the Boys' and Girls' dub
work in Dakota'County, and the re
lation or the school to this work.
ATTENDANCE
All teachers who are going to
teach in Dakota County the coming
year should attend this institute.
Also those who do not have schools
at this time should attend and meet
all other professional requirements,
if they wish to be considered as
available teachers when vacancies
occur. No recommendations can
well be given to those who fail to do
these things without ample reason.
We have a surplus of teachers this
year, so if there are those who do
not care to meet the professional
requirements there are others with
out schools who.have expressed their
willingness to do so.
Some of the rulings of the State
Department of Education, relative
to institute attendance, as applied to
our county, are as follows!
"The legal requirements for insti
tute attendance is construed to apply
to all teachers holding positions in
schools organized under articles 8 and
6." "The holders of first grade state
certificates and state professional
certificates are required to attend
the institute unless excused by the
county superintendent."
"It is legal to receive the enroll
ment fee of teachers excused from
attending the institute."
One of the provisions of law, that
is in line with the above rulings,
states this:
'The county superintendent may
excuse experienced teachers mfor
such (institute) attendance when ap
plication is made before the opening
of the institute and satisfactory rea
sons for absence are given in writing
by such teachers."
The high school teachers may meet
the institute requirement in one of
the following ways: By attending
the institute in Dakota County; or
attending some city institute; or
attending an approved summer
school, or 'a social session for sec
ondary teachers given in its connec-
wmamsmissKS
, VTA mWJM' 'HCWCEHMKt s-Sf-M - rt P
rTOw?
Up in the Air Almost
Four Yerr
CI HO in Tirktut
tion; or attending the State Teach
ers' Association.
All other teachers with more than
twenty months experience are re
quired fo attend the institute but
one day Tuesday or Wednesday
if they have attended an approved
summer school session this year.
Such teachers must submit a report
from the school, giving the time at
tended and the credits earned, to
avail themselves of this privilege.
ENROLLMENT
Teachers may enroll at any con
venient time before the institute
opens. But the special time for this
will be, on Monday, .from 8:00 to
9:00 a. m. The enrollment fee will
be one dollar. For convenience this
should be paid by a silver dollar.
All teachers holding any form of
county or state certificate 'are ex
pected to pay the regular enrollment
fee. No teacher is exempt from this,
regardless of any arrangement made
as to attendance. A teacher who
fails to pay this fee within a reason
able time, will be asked for it.
Every teacher should make a se
lection on Monday of the work most
adapted to her needs. If a change
in the program is desired thereafter,
the superintendent's consent should
be obtained. The instructors will
devote considerable attention to not
ing the attendance and interest of
the teachers.
, Heading Circle Books
The Reading Circle books for the
school year 1916-1917 will be on sale
by County Superintendent. Come
prepared to purchase them and save
the additional cost of securing them

of this work upon the opening of
their schools. .

Sergeant Bluffs En
tertains Old Settlers
Sergeant Bluffs pioneers held their
fourteenth annual reunion and pic
nic last Thursday. Quite a number
from Dakota county were in atten
dance and helped make the occasion
an enjoyable one.
Among those who made short
talks on pioneer days as they found
them in the early settlement of
Woodbury county, were Horace Dut
ton and A. H. Baker of this place.
The Sioux City Journal gives the
following account of their remarks,
ill hi1 with others:
(.. m headed flies during the day
ai.u mosquitoes by night proved the
worst handicaps that II. Dutton, of
Dakota City, had to contend with
when he came to the northwest.
Mr. Dutton settled at Dakota City
on July S, 1855.
Mr. Dutton rode horseback from
West Union, la., to Belvidero, la.
He was unarmed. From Belvidero
he went to Smithlnnd to the home of
his brother. When he arrived at
the end of the latter journey his
horse was covered with blood from
the bites of flies.
As a protection for cattle, smudg
es were built in the fields, Mr. Dut
ton tells. The cattle would go in
the pastures until they could stand
the insects no longer. They would
then dash for the smudge and stand
over it until they were again forced
to search for food.
When Mr. Dutton first visited
Sergeant Bluffs there was a black
smith shop and a postoffice there.
He Bottled four miles from Dakota
City. When the civil war broke out
he joined the Fifth Iowa cavalry.
He was stationed for two and one-
half years in Tennessee before he
saw a battle.
in July, mbi), an ox team drew a
lumbering' wagon- into Sergeant
lilutis after a journey of several
days across Iowa. In the wagon
was A. H. Baker, who had driven
from Delhi, la.
When Mr. Paker reached the
Whisky slough a few miles west of
Sergeant Bluffs he found five ox
teams mired in the mud. It requir
ed the combined lorces ot all the
men to get trie animals and wagons
across. More than half a day was
required to do the work.
Upon arriving in Council Bluffs,
Mr. Baker was given the contract
for the erection of the town's first
schoolhouse, a small, one-room, brick
structure.
ine nrst winter spent in tne new
country was the worst that Mr. Ba
ker can remember. For three
months sundogs followed the sun
every day. During that time there
was not a day when the, snow on the

south side of the houses thawed, Mr.
Baker stated. The snow was so
deep and hard that ice on the river
could not be seen. When the thaw
had come the following spring the
river did not carry out any ice, be
cause it thawed under the snow, Mr,
Baker relates.
In order to get hny from a stack
in the fields it was necessary to dig
a deep hole in the snow and "mine"
the hay, Mr. Baker said. The roads
between Sioux City and Council
Bluffs were about five feet above the
lovel of the fields. When two teams
met, n light always ensued to see
which would turn out.
The blizzards were so bad that it
was like traveling in the dark toiget
through one, according to Mr. Ba
ker. It was often necessary to give
the horses their heads and let them
find the way, as it was impossible
to see the road.
M. E. Church Notes.
