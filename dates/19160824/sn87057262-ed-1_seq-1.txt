they are struggling desperately -with

Effort of the railway presidents

(Laws of Supply and Demand
Control Prices Which
Will Not Always
Be High.
THIS WAS A BAD SEASON
Present'Abnormal Charges Will Ad
Just Themselves by Another
Year la Expert's
Opinion.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 24.—The su
per-high cost of living is not here to
stay, is purely commercial and readily
traceable to the basic laws of supply
and demand. This was the statement
today of Leon M. Etotabrook, chief of
the United States bureau of crop esti
mates, authority on food supplies.
While the prices of food should be
properly expected to advance com
mensurate with the rising prosperity
of the country to keep pace with the
Soaring prices fgraln, he said, are
directly due to the big falling off in
production in almost every class, tak
en In with the bumper outputs of the
past two years.
The sudden decrease in production
this year has naturally sent prices sky
ward.
Thq jump in the price of beans from
five cents last year to eleven cents
now. Is another example, Estabrook
said, of increased demand—from the
armies In Europe and oq the Mexican
border—with curtailed production, due
to unfavorable weather condltloife.
Prices on vegetables are purely sea
sonable and local, he said.
The season of 1915, unusually cool,
witnessed a bumper vegetable crop in
nearly all sections. The presnt season
has been anything but favorable for
truck gardners. Hence higher prices.
The constantly rising prices result,
Estabrook said, "from a gradual fall
ing off in production, while the de
mand has mounted steadily during the
past ten years." Intimation that a
half dozen large packing houses which
exert practlqp.1 monopoly, have con
trolled prices on cattle on the tioof to
such an extent that the cattle industry
has proven unprofitable, was made by
Estabrook.
Cattle raisers,, he said, have for the!
past ten years complained that Jhey
were unable to obtain sufficient money
from the packing houses to make the
business moderately
lucrative.
The
surest confirmation of price fixing in
Estabrook's opinion, is the fact that
ranchers are dropping cattle raising
in increasing large numbers until to
day'there are fewer cattle on the
hoof than there were in 1910—six
years ago.

OGDEN, Utah, Aug. 24.—'Republi

B. Hughes today headed into Utah,
the state which ioux years ago gave
William (H. Taft one of hds twb re
publican majorities. It was more or
less a day of rest for the nominee, so
be slept late.
Mrs. Hugfhes having put her (foot
down hard on any extra strenuosity,
a rather quiet program was arranged
Dor her husband in this, the first Utah,
city he has visited. He made one
important speech here this morning
and was scheduled to deliver a night
speech at Salt Lake City.
In his morning speech here, Gov
ernor Hughes enlarged on Ma dis
sertation regarding the democratic
tariff policy, with special reference to
the sugar tariff. Utah '•s a ibeet sugar
producing state and the republican
nominee's thrust at the democrats
wae received with enthusiasm.
It was announced today that Gov
ernor Htugihes will cut Ms stay at
Estes Park, Colorac&m to three days,
shortening his schedule by one day
all along the line. This step was
taken in order "that the candidate will
not be in, Kentucky at the same time
President Wilson is there. The
change in itinerary will keep iHugbes
in St. Louis for two day»—September
2 and 3.
The schedule for Hughes' Maine
trip has not been completed but it
is expected the candidate will make
at least two speeches—at Bangor
and Portland—reaching New York
a3out September 10. Then Hughes
hopes to rest for a couple of days
before starting out again on a tour
of New York state. He may speak
at Syracuse or AJJbany before re
turning to Now York from Oils pres
ent tour, leaving other .up-state points
for his second tour.
The tariff, federal employers' liabil
ity law, workmen's compensation
law and his own labor record were
discussed toy Hughes In his address
at ilCeno last night. He discoursed on
the necessity of cooperation between
capital and labor and declared "con
tented America will bo a successful

LONDON, Aug. 24.—The ancient
Greek city of Seres, forty-three mil«s
northeast of Salonika, is under attack
by a Btrong Bulgarian force, accord*
ing to Athens dispatches today.
The Greek garrison is ro-operatlng
with French forces In defending the
city. French artillery Is replying
vigorously to a heavy Bulgarian bom
bardment while the Greeks under
Colonel Christophoulous are throwing
up entrenchments. The Seres garri
son Is being reinforced by small
Greek detachments who retired upon
the city after spirited fighting with
numerically superior Bulgarian forces.
On practically every other sector of
tbe Balkan front tbe Bulgarian offen
sive has been brought to a standstill.
The Serbs have yielded but little
ground on the left wing since their
first retiremeht. Anglo-French forces
are consolidating and improving their
positions in the Dolran region on the
center.
The Bulgarian drive southward
against Seres, a city of 3C.OOO inhabi
tants, has created a new and more
critical situation at Athens. If Seres
falls, the Bulgars will havo practically
cut off all the Greek troops operating
eastern Macedonia, a territory
prized by the Bulgarians.
These Greek detachments in the
event Grece enters the war, could re
join the main Greek army only by a
