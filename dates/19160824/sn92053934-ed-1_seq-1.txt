Washington. Anc. 24. After con
tinued conferences today between
President Wilson and the select
committee of railroad executives,
the situation surrounding the
threatened strike was described as
hatine narrowed down to the fol
lowing: The railroad presidents, at least
the select committee of eight, are
willing t accept the eight-hour
dav Insisted upon by President
Wilson and the trainmen.
In return they ask that they be
assured as fully as possible that all
proper support be given and proper
means he used to assure them a
freight rate increase from the in
terstate commerce commission.
They ask also that congress create a
permanent board or coinmTsslon sim- j
ilar to the Canadian commission to ;
handle future labor difficulties. A;
commission of this character would be j
empowered to investigate when labor j
troubles threaten and no strike could ,

loting would be se-crtot- - j
These proposals w ere communicated

the federal board of mediation to the j
representatives of the men, who ap- j
parently regarded them favorably.
Judge Chambers then reported to Pres- j
ident Wilson and a sub-committee of;
railroad executives was summoned to'
tne "White house.
President Wilson is understood to
feel some sympathy for the counter
demands of the railroads and is not
averse to having the men accept them.
It is expected, however, that a vote of
the 640 labor representatives here must
first be taken.

Commissioner Chambers of the fed

London Advices Corroborate
Associated Press Story of
Arrival at Bremen.
London, Aug. 24, (1:05 p. m.) Re
ports of the return of the German sub
marine Deutschland from the United
States are corroborated in a telegram
received at Amsterdam from Bremen,
as forwarded by Reuter's correspond
ent. According to this information the
Deutschland traveled 4,200 miles on
her homeward voyage. At the begin
ning the sea was tempestuous, but
later it became more calm. The
Deutschlanci's engines worked fault-
lesslv. No icebergs were passed on
the journey.
The American government, says the
dispatch, acted in a correct manner as
a neutral, rigorously enforcing respect
for its frontier from British and
French warships by the employment
of its own men or war. After a British
cruiser entered Chesapeake bay at
night, even more effective measures
were taken to enforce neutrality.
No less than eight British warships,
it is said, were on the alert, surround
ed by numerous small American ves
sels which had been chartered for the
purpose of placing nets and obtaining
information as to the movements of
the Deutschland. Nevertheless the
submarine succeeded in leaving unde
tected. A distance of 100 miles was
traversed under water without diffi
culty. Eludes Johnny Unit.

contained in a telegram from Bremen.
The members of the crew were unwill
ing, it adds, to give details of the re
turn voyage. The arrival of the sub
marine surprised her owners, as she
was not expected to dock within a
week.
Captain Koenig Gnest of Kaiser.
The departure for America a week
ago of the German submarine Bremen
is reported in a dispatch from Bremen
as forwarded from The Hague by the
Exchange Telegraph company. It is
said the owners of the Deutschland
and the Bremen received word seven
days ago of the progress being made
by the Deutschland on her return voy
age and that it was not until they had
obtained this information that they
permitted the Bremen to depart.
The Deutschland took the same
route on both her voyages, the dis
patch says, returning to Germany by
the North sea.
Captain Faul Koenig of the Deutsch
land is being feted as a national hero
and has been summoned to Emperor
William's headquarters to report on
his voyage.
The Vossiche Zeitung publishes an
interview with Captain Paul Koenig of
the Deutschland, who expresses appre
ciation of the attitude of the United
States government in taking every
necessary measure to prevent viola
tion of neutrality in connection with
the departure of the submarine.
Crew To Be Decorated.
Amsterdam, Aug. 24. (via London,
3:45 p. m.) A dispatch today from
Berlin says Emperor William has sent
the following telegram to the owners
of the submarine Deutschland:
"With sincere pleasure I have Just
received news of the safe return of the
submarine liner Deutschland. I heart
ily congratulate the owners and build
ers of the vessel and the brave seamen
under Koenig's command."
The message also expresses the In
tention of the emperor to bestow dec
orations on members of the Deutsch
land's personnel.

SPECIAL SESSION
ILLINOIS SOLONS
Governor Donne Has Asked Legisla
ture Members if They Will At
tend and Vote.
Springfield. III.. Aug. 24. Governor
Edward F. Dunne, who arrived last
night from an inspection of Illinois
guardsmen on the border, today sent
telegrams to the 204 members of the
Illinois general assembly asking them
if they would attend a special session
of the legislature and vote for a bill
permitting the guardsment to vote in
the September primaries and the No
vember general election.
An immediate reply to the telegram
was requested and the governor ex
perts by tomorrow, night to have suffi
cient answers to determine what the
opinion of the members of the legisla
ture regarding the proposed special
session.
"I am in favor of the session if I can
be assured that the members will at
tend," said Governor Dunne. "I do not
propose to spend the state's money
without accomplishing anything. The
soldiers on the border should be per
mitted to vote."
The cost, of a special session will be
about $20,000. There are 10,000 Illi
nois soldiers in Texas, and at this
rate the legislation permitting the men
to vote will cost the state about $2 per
soldier.
The governor said he favors some
method of having the soldiers vote by
mail. His telegram specifically asks
the legislators if they will "favor a
bill permitting members of the na
tional guard in Texas to vote by mail
in primary election."
The proposed bill would be an emer
gency measure and its passage woul 1
require a two-thirds vote, or 136
votes.
Governor Dunne states he will not
call the special session unless he can
get at least this many legislators to
say they will attend and vote for the
measure.
The condition of the Illinois soldiers
and their care are the very best, the
governor stated today after his 10-day
stay in Texas. He believes that com
plaints about poor food and hard
treatment are unfounded.

Treasure of
Monks Goes
to Invaders
Geneva, Switzerland, Aug. 24, (via
Paris, 10:15 a. m.) The Austrians,
according to a special dispatch from
Innsbruck, have found the famous
treasures of the Detchani monastery,
near Cettinje, Montenegro, which the
monks had buried upon the approach
of the invaders. The accumulations
were those of seven centuries, con
sisting of jewels, and old coin of every
generation since the 13th century,
golden vessels and richly embroidered
vestments. The value of the whole ac
cumulation is estimated at several
millions of pounds.
It is said, adds the dispatch, that a
peasant betrayed to the Austrians the
catacombes where the treasure was
secreted.
FRENCH PROTEST
ACT OF GERMANS
rnited States and Other Neutrals
Sounded On Compulsory Work
of Inhabitants.
Paris, Ang. 24. What measures can
be taken at the proper time against
the emperor of Germany and other
persons held to be answerable for
compelling inhabitants of the invaded
cities of northern France to work in
the fields, and the immediate step.-,
which France might take in behalf of
these people, are questions to be raised
in the approaching session of the
chamber of deputies.
Deputy Bouyssou, in a letter to
Premier Briand, in which he severely
criticized the acts of the Germans to
ward the population of the invaded
region, gave notice that he would in
terpellate the premier on these sub
jects. Madrid, Spain, Aug. 24, (via Paris.)
The recent note of the French gov
ernment to neutrals protesting against
the treatment of the French inhabi
tants of Lille. Roubaix and Turcoins
by the Germans will be the subject, of
serious study by Premier Romanonej,
so as to permit him to act according
to strict neutrality, the premier states.
The Spanish government also will
consult other neutral nations regard
ing their attitude before giving
France an answer, he adds.
Premier Romanones has already
taken steps to learn the opinion of tha
American government as well as that
of other neutrals on the matter.

Boston, Aug. 24. The North Ger
man Lloyd liner Willehad, which has
been in refuge here since the outbreak
of the war, slipped out of the harbor
early today, presumably for New
London, Conn., for which port she ob
tained clearance papers last night.
Officials of the line asserted the
change was made to reduce docking
charges and denied reports that there
was any connection between the
Willehad's movements and the ex
pected arrival of the German mer
chant submarine Bremen.

DANES REJECTED
SALE OF ISLANDS
Proposal to Sell Danish West Indies to
United States Lost Ry 39
Votes.
London, Aug. 24. The Danish lands
thing has rejected the proposal to sell
the Danish West Indies to the United
States, says a Reuter dispatch from
Copenhagen.
The vote was taken In committee by
the landsthing, the upper house of the
Danish parliament. The treaty was
rejected by 39 votes.
Although the lower house of the
Danish parliament approved the pro
ject for sale of the islands to the Uni
ted States for $25,000,000, the action of
the landsthing in rejecting was ex
pected generally In Denmark. The
vote, however, does not necessarily
mean the final defeat of the project,
as other questions of a political na
ture are involved. Negotiations for
the formation of a coalition cabinet
failed yesterday and general elections
are to be held, after which the treaty
with the United States will be brought
up again.

RUSSIANS HELD BACK
Scene of Battle on Carpa

Into Bulgaria.
Berlin, Ang. 21, (by wireless to
Sayville). Defeat of the entente
forces along the Struma river on
the Macedonian front In northeast
ern Greece was announced by the
Bulgarian war of lice in a statement
issued yesterday at Sotia.
The statement says the entente
forces took liight, leaving the
ground covered with dead, and that
up to the time the statement was
issued the bodies of more than 400
dead had been counted. Large
quantities of ammunition and sup
plies, including eight machine
guns, were captured by Uie Bul
garians. Berlin, (via London, Ang. 21, 5J4
p. m.) The Bulgarians' attack Is
proceeding against the Serbian po
sitions near Lake Ostrovo on Uie
Macedonian front. The war office
report of today says the Bulga
rians defeated Serbian counter at
tacks. The Struma river follows an Irreg
ular course through northeastern
Greece, cutting across the open coun
try along the northern shore of the
Aegean sea.
Bulgarian forces appeared In this re
gion last week and took up defensive
positions along the river. They met
with no opposition from the entente
forces as this region Is some distance
east of the old battle line. Several
Greek forts were occupied and the Bul
garians threw up entrenchments.
The Importance of this line lies In
the fact that It shuts off the allies from
the easiest route into Bulgaria, If an
Invasion should be attempted and en
ables the Bulgarians to hold strong
defensive positions behind the river.

Next Move I'p to Rumania.
Berlin, Wednesday. Aug. 23 (via
London, Aug. 24, 12:40 p. m.) Gov
ernment circles here, though none too
optimistic, view the Rumanian situa
tion calmly, taking the attitude that
it is Rumania's next move. The feel
ing is that the central powers have
done everything possible to meet Ru
mania's views and that Rumania, In
persisting in the course desired by the
entente and her own expansionist par
ty, will find the central powers ready,
in which event It is to bo expected
every effort will be made to Insure
that the new war theatre Is on Ru
manian soil.
Information from Vienna Indicates
that the Austro-llungarian govern
ment, bearing In mind the results of
the negotiations concerning Italy's
claims before that nation entered the
war, has been at no time disposed to
offer Rumania similar concessions for
fear that this again would be mistaken
for a sign of weakness.
At this moment there Is not discern
ible the slightest effort to persuad
Rumania taking any other course than
one due to her. own, Initiative, M-
