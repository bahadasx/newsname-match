This Following Final Confer
ence at White House.
WILSON HOWEVER OPTIMISTIC
Secret Conferences "Weigh
Counter Propositions.
Hoads Realize Nothing to Do
But Accept 8-Hour Plan.
Washington, Aug. 24. After con
tinued conferences today between
President Wilson and the telet com
mittee of railroad executives, the situ
ation surrounding the threatened
strike was described as having narrow
ed down to the following:
The railroad presidents, at least the
select committee of eight, are willing
to accept the eight-hour day insisted
upon by President Wilson and the
trainmen.
In return they ask that they be as
sured as fully as possible that all
proper support be given and proper
means be used to assure them a
ireighl rate increase from the inter
state commerce commission.
They ask also that congress create
a permanent board or commission eim
iiur to the Canadian commission to
handle future labor difficulties. A
commission of this character would be
empowered to investiKate when labor
troubles threaten and no strike could
be called or strike vote taken pending
its investigation, a full report of which
would be made public at its conclu
sion. At the end of the investigation arbi
tration would be suggested but if not
accepted, opportunity would be given
to the men to lake a strike vote. The
balloting would be secret.
Executives Not So Hopeful.
Washington, Aug. 24. "Since mid
night the situation has taken a change
lor the worse." declared a member of
the railway presidents' sub-committee
before the sub-committee left for the
White House at their own request,
this afternoon to confer with Presi
dent Wilson.
The situation is very serious," he
added.
The sub-committee. R. S. Lovett of
the Union Pacific, Daniel Willard of
the Baltimore & Ohio and Hale Hoi
len of the Burlington, expected to re
port the resul. of their visit to a meet
ing of the whole number of railway
presidents at 3 o'clock. They left a
meeting of the latter which had been
in session since 1 1 o'clock, to make
the trip to the White House.
"Kvervthing now depends on this
visit to the White House," said one of
the three. He would not discuss what
turn the negotiations had taken to
make the situation worse. The execu
tive in question is one who has nereto
fore talked optimistically concerning
the prospects for adjustment.
Confers With Vnknown Lead-.-rs.
Today's meeting at the White House
whs first announced by Jud.ue Cham
bers of the Federal Board of Media
tion and Conciliation. Jt followed a
visit hv him to the hall where the
brotherhoods' 640 representatives were
in session. There he conferred with
the- four brotherhood presidents and
left them, apparently in increased
(.mid spirits. Indications grew today
that the railway presidents were try
inc to find a way out of the situation
o:i the basis of conceding the eight
hojr Jay in some form but not in the
film demanded by the brotherhoods,
supported bv President Wilson. The
meeting at the White House lasted
nlv ten minutes. Leaving the White
House. Hoiden. spokesman of the
group, said:
The situation is not any more hope
ful than it has been."
"Is it hopeful at all?" he was asked.
Keep Plugging Away.
"I cannot make any statement as to
that." he replied. "All I kr.ow is that
.s long as there is something to work
with I am going to keep plugging
away."
"Contrary to the pessimism reflect
ed by some of the railroad presidents
was the very hopeful attitude of the
president In administration circles
belief is strong that things look better
than they have at any time certainly
there is no danger of any immediate
breaking off of negotiations-"
While Hoiden said the conference
with the president was requested by
himself, on suggestion of the sub-committee
of eight, it was stated at the
White Hour.e that the president had
asked for the conference.
Kxpc-ets Iresldeiits Decision Today.
Washington, Aug. 24. Judge W. L.
Chambers, of the federal board of
mediation and conciliation, conferred

with representatives of the brother
hoods. Chambers would not discuss in
any way the purpose of either visit.

the conference after seeing representa

AUSTRIANS FIND
MONASTERY GOLD
WORTH MILLIONS
Geneva, Aug. 24. The Austrians ac
cording to a special dispatch from
Innsbruck, have found the famous
treasures of the Detchni monastery,
near Cettinje, Montenegro, which the
monks had buried upon thn approach
ot the invaders. The accumulations
were those of generations since the
thirteenth century, golden vessels, and
richly embroidered vestments.
The value of the whole accumula
tion is estimated at several million
pounds. It is said adds the dispatch

$2 WHEAT COMING
Government Report Intensifies
Black Rust Scare.
Unprecedented Damage Cuts
Supply From Torthwest.
Washington, Aug. 24. "Black
rust" probably will be the cause of
sending wheat prices soaring to unheard-of
levels, with the coming of the
spring wheat output, according to the
United States department of agricul
ture today. One official said $2 wheat
now appears probable.
One of the most severe epidemics
in this black rust ever recorded has
swept he wheat belt of the north
west with unprecedented damage, pre
dicting a production far below normal.
Commercial reports arriving at the
department not only substantiate the
predictions of the government ex
perts, but it is said tend to place the
loss at a far greater figure, with cor
respondingly high prices certain for
the fall and winter. The infested
area Minnesota and the two Dakotas
produce, it is said, the greater part
of the epnng crop.
HAS FOUND ENEMY
Defending Fleet , Prepares to
Meet Invading Force.
Two Scout Lines and Subma
rines Ready to Attack.
Washington, Aug. 24. The fleet of
enemy transports bringing an invad
ing army to bo landed on the Atlantic
seaboard have been found by the de
fending fleet and the first point in the
big naval war game goes to the de
fending forces. Early today the big
wireless towers at Arlington picked
up orders being sent from Admiral
Helm's flagship disposing his line to
meet the developments. No word has
come of the whereabouts of the hostile
battle fleet commanded by Admiral
Mayo, but it is supposed to be near
the transports.
Admiral Helm is sweeping the ocean
toward the last known position of the
enemy with a line of scouts covering
several hundred miles. They are
steaming on parallel courses at inter
vals of thirty miles. Any change in the
course of one wing of the line requires
altering the courses of all scouts in
order that a gap shall not be left
through which the enemy fleet could
slip for an attack upon the coast.
Throw Out Second Lino.
Rainy or misty weather may seri
ously hamper the defending scouts, as
the thirty-mile intervals are wide
enough to permit the enemy to slip by
under such conditions. P'cr that rea
son an inner line of scouts is being
maintained, and close in to the coast,
behind the defending battle fleet, the
submarine flotilla is ready in case the
enemy invade the outer line. Karly
today the .navy intelligence officers
discovered a "plot" to blow up the
storage oil tanks at Narragansett and
to destroy the magazines in the naval
shore stations. AH commanders were
warned and ordered to report what
steps they had taken to thwart the at
tempted attacks.

Ancient Metropolis Is Bat 43
Miles From Saloniki. ; .
London, Aug. 24. The ancient
Greek city of Seres, forty-three miles
northeast of Saloniki, is under attack
by. a strong Bulgarian force, accord
ing to Athens dispatches today.
The Greek garrison is co-operating
with French forces in defending the
city. French artillery is replying vig
orously to a a heavy Bulgarian bom
bardment, while the Greeks under
command of Colonel Christophoious
are throwing up entrenchments. The
Seres garrison is being reinforced by
small Greek detachments which re
tired upon the city after spirite 1 fight
ing with numerically superior Bul
garian forces.
Ualfcans Checked Other Sectors.
On practically every other sector of
the Balkan front, the Bulgarian of
fensive has been brought to a stand
still. The Serbs have yielded but little
ground on the left wing since their
first retirement. Anglo-French forces
are consolidating and improving their
positions in the Doiran region on the
center.
The Bulgarian drive southward
against Seres, a city of 30,000 inhabi
tants, has created a new and more
critical situation at Athens. If Seres
falls, the. Bulgars will have practically
cut off all the Greek troops operating
in Eastern Macedonia, a territory
highly prized by the Bulgarians. The
Greek detachments, in the event
Greece enters the war, could rejoin
the main Greek army only by a march
along the sea coast and across a nar
row isthmus formed by Tachino lake
and the sea.
HUGHESJN UTAH
In Ogden Today; Night Speech
at Salt Lake City.
G. O. P. Tariff Policy Cheered
by Beet Raisers.
Ogden, Utah, Aug. 24. Republican
Presidential Candidate Charles E.
Hughes today headed into Utah, the
state which four years ago gave Wil
liam H. Taft one of his two Republi
can majorities.
It was more or less a day of rest
for the nominee, so hi, slept late. Mrs.
Hughes, however, put her foot down
hard on any extra strenuosity and a
rather quiet proceeding was arranged
for her husband in this, the first Utah
city he has visited. He made one
Important speech here this morning
and was scheduled to deliver a night
speech at Salt Lake City.
In his morning speech here. Gover
nor Hughes enlarged on his disserta
tion regarding the Democratic tariff
policy, with special reference to the
sugar tariff. Utah is a beet sugar
producing state and the Republican
nominee's thrust at the Democrats was
received with enthusiasm. It was an
nounced today that Governor Hughes
will cut his stay at Estes Park, Colo.,
to three days, shortening his schedule
by one day all along the line. This
step was taken in order that the can
didate will not be in Kentucky at the
same time President Wilson is there.
The change in itinerary will keep
j Hughes in St. Louis for two days
I September 2 and 3.
Cuts Day Off Schedule.
The schedule for Hughes' Maine
trip has not been completed but it
is expected the candidate will make at
least two speeches at Bangor and
Portland reaching New I'ork about
September 10. Then he hopes to rest
for a couple of days before starting
out again on a tour of New Tork
state. He may speak at Syracuse or
Albany before returning to New York
from his present tour, leaving other
up-state points for his second tour.
The tariff, federal employes liability
law, workmen's compensation law and
his own labor record were discussed
by Hughes in his address at Reno last
night. He discoursed on the necessity
of co-operation between capital and
labor and declared "contented America
will be a stale America." He de
clared in favor of a "world court" to
settle controversies among nations,
after the present war in Europe ends.

Carl Marr, Who Dropped
Bombs on French Is Here.
JCow Preparing Military Aero
plane for Phil Billard. ;
TRIED TO SMUGGLE PLANS
But Kaiser's Secret Service Men
Took Them Away.
Germany Will Be Starved in 18
Months He Declares.
A year ago Car! Marr was in the
German Aviation Corps engaged In
dropping bombs on the French. Today,
he is working on the Longren aviation
field near Pauline assisting in prepar
ing a big military aeroplane for Capt.
Phil Billard, a Frenchman.
Marr is well-known in aviation cir
cles in America and has made flights
in various towns in this state.' Long-
ren knew him several years ago. Marr
decided to return to Germany and got
there about the time the war began.
He was an American then but with
six brothers offered his services to the
kaiser. Aviators are valued at a high
rate in Germany and while Marr didn't
enlist he aided in aeroplane work and
made several flights over the French
lines while the officer In the passenger
seat dropped bombs. All of his brothers
were killed and Marr decided to return
to America.
A Good Mechanic.
A few weeks ago Longren employed
him and since then Marr has been
aiding in preparing the Billard aero
plane for flight. Longren looks upon
Marr as the best mechanic he has ever
employed and permits him to work
more with the motor than any man
ever in his employ.
Marr doesn't believe the war will be
over for eighteen months. At the end
of that time Germany will be starved
out, he declares.
Searched by Germans.
America doesn't realize the advance
ment made in aeroplane manufactur
ing in Germany ad ace the war. Marvi
say". n inempnatr orrng blue
prints of a Folker machine to Amerlea
with him but was stopped, searched
by the Germans and the plans taken
away from him. If he had succeeded
in getting the plans to this country
he could have made a fortune by sell
ing them to an American manufac
turer. "There are 15,000 aeroplanes in
Germany now," said Marr. "The aero
plane corps is looked upon as the most
important unit of the service."
First Flight Tomorrow.
The big, 125 horse power engine of
the Billard machine was started twice
Tuesday afternoon. The pulling pow
er proved to be greater than the con
tract stipulates. A few more touches
and the 'plane will be ready for flight.
It is probable Longren will make his
first flight Thursday morning.
j Longren will make the first flight
alone. Marr will accompany him on
the second. Mrs. Longren the hird
and a newspaper man will accompany
the Topeka aviator on his fourth
, flight. Then the aeroplane will be
i turned over to Captain Billard. This
: is the first aeroplane with a seat for
a passenger ever built by Longren.
Longren, his workmen and Captain
Biilard work from daylight to dusk n
the machine. Captain Billard intends
to irake exhibition flights in Kansas
during the fall.

IN SAME HOMES
Infantile Paralylss Often - At
tacks Several Children.
X. Y. Department Stores Take
Steps to Check Disease.
New Tork, Aug. 24. Despite a be
lief that Infantile paralysis seldom at
tacks more than one member of the
st'.me family, figures prepared by the
United States public health service
show that in 227 families here that
more than one child has had the dis
ease. In more than 200 of these fam
ilies only two children were afflicted
while in 20 families three children
have suffered attacks. In one family
there were five cases.
Nevertheless, the health commis
sioner asserts that the great majority
of the children is not susceptible to
infantile paralysis. Of the first seven
thousand cases only 3. 36 per cent were
those of children whose sisters or
brothers previously had the disease.
Stores Aid Fight. .
Most of the large department stores
now are refusing to permit the return
of children's clothing or toys after
they have once been delivered, in order
to prevent a spread of the epidemic in
that way. Some of the department
stores refuse to accept returns of any
kind from buildings in which cases of
infantile paralysis have occurred. The
department of health, however, has
made no ruling on this matter.
Health department officials were en
couraged by today's reports on the
epidemic which showed a substantial
decrease In the number of deaths and
new cases. During the 24 hours end
ing at 10 a. m., 30 children died and
109 were stricken. This compares fa
vorably with Wednesday's figures, 42
deaths and 131 new cases.

chairman of the Joint naval and mili
tary board, in a speech last night. The
new dirigibles are 780 feet long, can
travel eighty miles n hour and can
ascend three miles to escape shells
from anti-aircraft guns. Each can
carry five tons of explosivies. The
Germans have completed two of the
new airships and will have four others
available for raids on England in Oc
tober, Baron Montague said.

teen high explosive and fifteen incen
diary bombs were dropped in op-a
