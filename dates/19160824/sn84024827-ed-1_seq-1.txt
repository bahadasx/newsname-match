EMERGENCY MEASURE
Declares the Bill Is Wrong in

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Aug. 23. Debate
In the Senate on the emergency rev
enue bill today was featured by a long
speech by Senator Penrose, urging In
dustrial preparedness to safeguard
the country against commercial war
fare at the close of the European war,
and vigorously attacking the pending
measure. He questioned the legality
of the proposed munitions tax and
general legislation toward substitut
ing direct taxation for the protective
tariff. !
Senator Underwood, author of the
present tariff law, and Senator Mc
Lean, also participated in the discus
sion, the former defending the tariff
law against Republican attacks and
the latter charging the Democratic ad
ministration with extravagance and
deploring its tendency to, resort for
federal taxation that shorld be re
served to fie- states. ,
"This question of industrial pre
paredness," said Senator Penrose,
"has received definite recognition In
the pending bill In the provision rela
tive to dyestuffs. This .concession
made by those who abhor imports and
duties and lean to the thought that
nearly all of the expenses of the gov
ernment, so far -as possible, should be
raised by taxes on Incomes and other
direct taxes, seems to me to create a
surrender wnicn gives up tneir wnoie
case. If dyestuffs require a protective
duty, and if they are essential to our
industrial Independence, I conclude
that the same argument can be ap
plied all along the line."
Referring to the recent conference
of the nations at war regarding com
mercial plans that will operate to
their own benefit after the war, the
Pennsylvania senator said:
"In the face of these developments i
which are occurring and with the .
liklihood of still more portentious as-
pects of trade war arising in the near
future, we are called upon to pass the
pending revenue measure without any j
regard whatever for the menacing
situation which will Inevitably con
front us as the war in Europe draws
to a close. I
"We are drifting to a system of di- j
rect taxation at a time when nearly ;
every civilized nation is going in the :
other direction. There Is every rea- j
son to believe that with the close of
the war, new trade alliances and
treaties will be made which will make '
it more imperative that the United j
States should get ready for Industrial
preparedness." j
If a munitions tax is to be imposed.:
Senator Penrose declared. It should
be applied to all who sell contraband .
goods to nations at war.
"Investigation discloses." he said,
"that the munitions tax is sectional,
ununiform. of doubtful validity, of
questionable legality, and objection
ahle in many other ways.
"It is also argued that such a tax
would affect our neutrality. A neutral ,
government does not protect trade in
contraband. It cannot engage 1n It i
itself. It is merely relieved of the ;
expense of suppressing It." j
Senetor Underwood spoke at length j
in defense of the existing tariff. After;
reviewing the operations of the tariff j
law, and submitting a multitude of
statistics. Senator Underwood raid j
that he had "conclusively denionstrat-1
ed that tariff taxes now on the statute I
books do not jeopardize American In
dustry or threaten American labor."
The revenue bill. Senator Under- j
wood said, was necessitated by th" de- ;
mands of the wealth of the country!
for military preparedness.

BERLIN, Aug. 23. The mer
chant submarine Deutschland ar
rived at the mouth of the Weiser
cn August 23, according to the
Overseas News Agency.
The Agency says that the
Deutschland arrived on the after
noon of August 23 and anchored
before the mouth of the river. All
on board were well.
The Deutschland, a German
submarine built for carrying mer
chandise, arrived at Baltimore
from Bremen cn July 9 with a
cargo of dyestuffs and mail. Her
arrival was hailed in Germany as
the beginning of a regular sub
marine merchant service between
the United States and Germany
which would be able to defy the
British blockade. It was an
nounced that she would be fol
lowed shortly by the Bremen, a
sister ship.
The Deutschland left Baltimore
cn her return journey on August
1, with a cargo of rubber and
metal.
STATE TICKETS
FILED WITH
Petitions for George OIney as
Governor Are the Most Lib

Just get in Under the Wire.
Fifty-nine candidates for state of
fices representing the Republican,
Socialist and Democratic parties, had
filed their petitions up 'o five o'clock
Tuesday afternoon with Secretary of
State Sidney P. Osb'orn.
All day long there was a constant
stream of petitions coming into the
office. The crest was reached the
night before, keeping the clerks work
ing until late in the evening. The
Socialist party filed their petitions all
on Monday. Not tv be outdone in this
matter, late Tuesday afternoon the
Republican party filed petitions for Its
candidates.
Thousands of names are attached to
the petitions. Probably the nomina
tion petition most liberally signed is
that of Geo. A. Olney, candidate for
governor on the Democratic ticket.
About 2,500 names were filed, but it
was claimed at his headquarters that
5.000 more were being held.
The Republican petitions did not
come in until late In the afternoon.
At four-thirty not even Tom Campbell's
petition had been placed In the hands
of the assistant secretary of state.
Considerable anxiety was felt, but a
few minutes before five o'clock Secre
tary of the Republican State Central
Committee Andrew Baumert appeared
literally i'jaded down with petitions.
He dumped them all on Secretarv Os

if to mention that an important and

NEW YORK, Aug. 23. President

Catholic Central Verein for having
"preferred charges" in his message
to congress, "against part of our cit

WASHINGTON. Aug. 23. In anoth
er effort to aid the presid-nts of the
country's railroads to find some way
in which to accept an eight hour day
for their trainmen and avert the
threatened strike. President Wilson
tonight conferred for an hour and a
half with presidents Hale Holden. of
the Burlington, Daniel Wiilard of the
Baltimore and Ohio and R. S. Lovett
of the Union Pacific Neither White
House officials nor the presidents
would discuss th conference. Ft was
said on high authority, however, that
the three executives went to the
White House to receive an answer to
the suggestions that they made to
President Wilson last night, that he
give them more specific information
as to how the railroads may get the
additional revenue necessary to take
care of the greater payrolls that will
come with the eight hour day.
Earlier In the day President Wilson
discussed the railroad situation at
length with Senator Newlands and
Representative Adamson, chairmen of
the two committees of congress in
charge of legislation affecting inter
state commerce. Their visit wa the
consequence of that of the railroad
nien last night. The two chairmen
are said to have agreed that the
President's position In the present
situation is right and to have said
that every effort could be expected
in congress to put through any legis
lation which might help solve the
present difficulty nd provide' for
the future.
One of the means for recoupment
suggested by the President to the
railroads in his public outline of his
position was through an increase in
freight rates. It was pointed out to
night that the President cannot di
rectly ask the interstate commerce
commission ta grant Increases to the
rates. Congress, however, might pass
a resolution directing the commission.
In view of what it considers an un
precedented situation, to grant high
er rates.
Congress also might pass a resolu
tion directing the commission to In
vestigate all matters involved In the
controversy and the whole subject of
the regulation of the railroads unS
their employes. One of the results
expected from today's conference is
an early effort to pass bills Introduc
ed several months ago to increase the
commission's membership from seven
to nine. It became evident tonight
that most of the railroad executives
have come to believe that there can
be only one way of preventing a
strike and that Is by acreptina the
eicht hour day plan. The chief ef
fort in their own conferences today
was to find some scheme by which an
8 hour day may be put in operation
on all railroads at the least added ex
perse. Many suggestions a'ong this
line had been "'ade by the President
but no one of them has been regarded
as probable.
