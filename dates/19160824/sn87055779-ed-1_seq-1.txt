SOUTH BEND MERCHANTS arc talking about a
"Fashion Week" the week following the Interstate
Eair.
Why not the same week, gentlemen during the fair?
The" fair is to clue at 7:3u in the evening this year.
Why not then, i;ive the people something down town,
really worth while to go to; something aside from refresh
ment parlors and screen or vauJevilie theatricals.
Merchants could close an afternoon or two, allo-A-in,
the clerks opportunity to. see the fair, and then, remain
open if need be, two or three hours in the evening.
It would virtually result as the moving of the fair from
Sprinbrook down town, for the evening entertainment.
The merchants could everyone exhibit their prettiest, un
der such a program; exhibit it at the fair without leaving
their stores.
It would be a cooperative program. It the weather is
good, South Bend will undoubtedly entertain one of the
biggest crowds in its history during fair we-ek Sept. 12-13-1-4-15-16
and the purpose of ''Fashion Week" is to
put the newest and prettiest to the front where every
body can ee.
Öf course, it is only a suggestion.
