VON TIRPITZ WARLIKE.
Former German Naval Chief Demands
War With United States.
Washington, Aug. 24^-Grand Ad
miral von Tlrpitz, author of the policy
of unrestricted submarine warfare up
on merchant craft, has Issued a mani
festo demanding" war with the United
States.
Information to this effect has been re
ceived by the state department and has
caused considerable concern to the of
ficials. Von Tlrpitz insists in his state
ment that Germany is handicapped in
the prosecution of her Ufe-and-death
struggle by the limitations imposed up
on submarine operations by the Ger
man government, at
the
instance of the
United States.
He argues that this country. In any
case, is hostile to Germany and that
the time has gone by to consider its
wishes. He believes'should the United
States enter the war. on the side of the
allies it would do no more harm to the
German cause than it already has done.
Published in Berlin.
The text of the Von Tlrpitz memo
randum was published by the Berlin
newspapers. The .foreign correspond
ents were not permitted to transmit
It to their papers. As a consequence
only the neutral diplomats have been
able to forward It by cipher messages
and in their official1 mail pouches.
It is not believed by the authorities
that the kaiser will permit himself and
his government to be Influenced into
the adoption of a hostile policy toward
the United States. Nevertheless, it is
considered highly significant that the
papers were permitted to publish Von
Tirpitz' manifesto and that at the same
time the German authorities gave to
the press the fact that the American
government had made confidential in
quiries in regard to a. submarine at
tack on the American steamer Oswego.

OUTLOOK HOPEFUL
AFTER CONFERENCE
President Wilson Confident He Has
Forcer Railroad Presidents and Man
agers to Yield to His Plan—Both
Managers and Brotherhoods Feared
to Break Off Negotiations Because
of Public Sentiment.
Washington, Aug. 24.—After con
tinued conferences today between
the president and the select com
mittee of railroad executives the
situation surrounding the threat
ened strike was described as hav
ing narrowed down to the follow
ing:
The presidents, at least the se
lect committee of eight, are will
ing to take th» eight-hour day in
sisted on by President Wilson and
the trainmen.
In return they ask that they be
assured as fully as possible that all
proper support be given and prop
er means be used to assure them a
freight rate increase from the in
terstate commerce commission.
They ask also that congress cre
ate a permanent board or commis
sion like the Canadian commission
to handle labor difficulties.
A commission of the kind would
be empowered to look into labor
troubles when they come up and.
no strike could be called or votes
taken pending its investigation, a
full report of whidh would be made
public at its conclusion.
At the end of the investigation
arbitration would be suggested but
if not accepted opportunity would
be given the men' to' taike a strike
vote. The balloting would be secret.
These proposals were communi
cated today by "Commissioner
Chambers, of the fedfral board of
mediation, to ths'representatives of
the men, who regarded them fa
vorably. Judge Chambers then re
ported to President Wilson, and the
sub-committee of railroad execu
tives was summoned to the White
House.
President Wilson is understood
to feel some %yir»pathy for the
counter demands of the railroads
and nojt adverse tor having the men
accept them. It ia expected, how
ever, that a vote of the 640 labor
representatives here must be taken
before they can receive the neces
sary endorsement.
Washington. Aug.
24.—After
confer­
ences with representatives of the em
ployes and employers. Commissioner
Chambers, of the federal mediation
board, discussed the strike situation
with President Wilson and made ar
rangements for a group of the railroad
presidents to see Mr. Wilson imme
diately. There were reports that a
settlement was in sight.
After the conference it was said the
outlook was "more hopeful, if any
thing."
The president sent for the execu
tives to acquaint them with the prog-,
ress being made by him in the nego
tiations.
Wilton Sees Victory.
President Wilson believes that he
has won his fight to prevent a nation
al railroad strike.
He received after dinner the rail
road committee, comprising Messrs.
Holden, Lovett and Willard, and dis
cussed the details which must be ar
ranged before the settlement of the
controversy can be announced. Dur
ing the day he called congressional
leaders to the White House to pave
the way for the legislation necessary
to put Into effect the solution being
perfected.
For the purpose of affecting the at
titude of the president the railroad
officials and the railroad employes
are engaged in maneuvers which may
have results different from what they
expect.
Many Criticise Wilson.
Neither side wants a strike, but the
railroad officials are giving out state
ments attacking and criticising Mr.
Wilson—former Secretary of War
Dickinson, a democrat, wl\o Is recelv
er for the Rock Island, Is especially
active in this respect—and the repre
sentatives of th»» brotherhoods are
dwelling upon the revolt of a minority
who want to leave Washington with
out farther parleying and declare ft
strike.
As a matter of fact, neither the rail
road officials nor the brotherhood rep
resentative? 'dare to assume the grave
responsibility of terminating the ne
gotiations which President Wilson is
conducting. The majority of the
brotherhood men are entirely satisfied
with the compromise proposal sub
mitted by Mr. Wilson to the roads.
The railroad officials are endeavor
ing to get what they uan as compen
sation for the eight-hour day stand
ard, which the president has described
at a basic condition of negotiation.

Berlin. Aug. 24.—Government circles
here, tho none too optimistic, view the

attitude that it is Roumania's next

to meet Roumanian views, and that
Roumania, in insisting on the lead of
the expansionist party, will find the
central powers ready to carry the war
to Roumanian soil.
Information from Vienna indicates
that the Austro-Hungarian govern
ment, bearing In m!nd the result of ne

fore that nation entered the war, has
been at no time disposed to offer Rou

that this would eguin be mistaken for

Officials Are Hopeful Worst Is OVor.
New York, Aug. 24.—Health depart
merit officials were encotraged by to
day's report? on the Infantile paralysla
epidemic, which showed a substantial
decrease In deaths and new cases. Dur
ing tho past twenty-four nours thirty
four children died and 109 were strick
in.*This compares favorably with yes
lerday's figures of forty-two deaths
and 131 new cases.
The daily average of new cases thus
far this week has been 111, as against
130 last week, and the death average
unchanged at thirty-three. Patients
discharged as 'recovered" now number
187.
More than half a million dollars has
already been spent here In fighting the
epidemic and caring for patients, health
department officials estimated today.
Majority Are Immune.
Despite a belief that Infantile para
lysis seldom attacks more than one
member of a family, figures prepared
by the United .States public health ser
vice shows that in 227 families here
more than one child has had the dis
ease. In more than 200 of theso fam
ilies only two children were afflicted,
while in twenty families three children
have sufTered attacks. In one family
there were Ave cases.
Nevertheless the health officers as
sert that the average Indicates that the
great majority of children are not sus
ceptible to paralysis. In the first 7,000
cases only 3.38 per cent of the children
were sisters or brothers of those who
had the disease.
Most department stores are now re
fusing to permit the return ofi chil
dren's clothing or toys after having
been delivered. Some of the stores re
fuse to accept returns of any kind from
buildings in which cases of paralysis
have occurred. The department of
health, however, has made no ruling on
this matter.
