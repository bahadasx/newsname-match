POINDEXTER TELLS
TARIFF RECORDS
Senator Miles Poindexter, candi
date for the Republican nomina
tion to succeed himself, spoke Fii
day before the postoffice, and ex
plained bis votes on the tariff and
other measures concerning which
the dear old htp.nd-pat tress of Uie
State is sputtering.
Better tban Bix feet, tall, Poindex
ter Rives an impression of mental
bigness as well; indeed, tho very
fait that he posßfsses brains enough
to vote Independently has Bet
against hhn the Republican press,
the vote-it-Lstraight-because-giand
dadddy-did newsi.opcs, who want a
polite sort of rubber-slaap as an
otllcta).
"I am accutsd of voting for some
Democratic meal ies," said Senator
"I tidmit it, and I tell
«':u frankliy that if I atn returned
to the Senate, I will continue to
vott for measures 1 helie've meri
torious, whether they ar* Republi
can or Democratic in origin.
"I am willing to abide by the
people's decision on the record I
have made.
"I myself introduced an amend
ment for the protection of lumhe
in the tariff bill. 1 fought for it
I debated it. I cited the laws of
Canada, our BOIQ.pei.HOf in lumber
to show why It would be passed. 1
voted for a tariff on cherries and
Chinese eggs, let 70 cant* a bushe
on wheat.
"I voted agatßtft the free imuhei
amendment Introduced by Congress
man Tawney, .sti ndpnt Republican.
"My vote did not pass the Under
wood tariff bill. It would have DOM
a different bill if 1 hud my
about it. But 1 voted for it be
cause It. was more than a tariff hill,
aud was the only way of getting th<
Payne-A'Hrloh measure off the
books. For 20 yea'-s I have be
lieved In ;iti income tax. I voted v
submit a Unite ! States const'tti
ticnal amendment, to make such s
lax on exaggerated incomes possi
ble. The var'ous state legislatures
approve It. Aud the Underwood
liiw contained auch an income tux.
"It also confined another feat
ure, which. If enforced, would i
pitied, restore a rittch-needeil Am
ettean merchant marine. This was
to charge an additional 10 per cent
ad valorem duty for commodities
hi ought here in toielgn vessels.
"But the real reason for the op
position of the wot.ld-be party boss
es it, tnat the organization can't
tell me whore to get off."
