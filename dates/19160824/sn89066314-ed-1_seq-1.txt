NUMBER 306
CITY COUNCIL DID NOT
Mayor Batterton, Fire Chief
and City Attorney Reply
to "Taxpayer."
NO PAY FOR ARRESTS
No Violation of State Stat
utes in Raising Salary
of the Policemen.
The purchase of an atmliarj car
for the Columbia Fire Department h
the citj council is still m the bal
ance The council will hold a spe
cial meeting Tuesd.-j out according to
Major J M Battel ton the matter ot
purchasing the car will not even be
diseussed and it is not Known when
(U finite action will be taken m the
matter
In Tuesdaj s issue of the AIis
soiiri.iu there appealed m the Open
Column an article signed "Taxpajer"
in which the agitation lor the bujmg
of a car for Chief Kail Kurtz was
again brought to liht In that article
also the gavel was ued upon the po
lice department, the supposedlj un
lawful manner in which their salaries
had been raised bj the council, and
the promiscuousncss with which the
police automobile has been used
Mil) or Il.tttcrtou Replies.
When asked toda what he had to
sa regarding the statements made in
the open column of the Missounan b
Tapajcr" relatie to the purchase
of the car for the fire department and
also in regard to the comment made
upon the manner in which the police
men's salaries had been raised. Major
Battel ton said:
"It seems there is a lot of unneces
sary comment buns made about the
council bujmg a car for the fire de
partment I do not think the council
men aie even considering such a thing
just at this time and at our meeting
Tuesdaj 1 don't think the matter will
een come up for discussion
"So fai as raising the salaries of
the police is concerned the council did
nothing hateer that was unlawful
when the policemen s salaries were
increased from $70 to $S0 per month
When the salaries were laised the
officers had alreid handed their
res'enations to the council and
when an oliecr resigns before
hand the council Ins a lawful
right to leappoint the same official
or another man m his place Had the
officers iceeived their raise without
first resigning, then the state law
would hae been iolatid But as the
matter stands nothing has been done
tint in an waj has been a wolation
of the law '
Cilj Vttornc starrilt Gives Mews.
Citj Attornej George S Starrett
said this morning that he had noth
ing to sa in rcplj to the "Taxpay
ers" statement regarding the pur
chase of an aimliarj ear for the fire
department In regard to the other
points Air Starred said:
"In anj business in the world as
large as Columbia's in which there
are as many calls as come to the po
lice department here, a car is abso
lutilj needed Xo individual, operat
ing a business that large, would think
of answering the various calls over
the citj unless he had an automobile
in which to do it Xo doubt, Mr
Tapaer" can walk over the town
to look after his business but no doubt
he hasn't enough business to make
walking verj much of a task.
Don't Get 51 For Irrests.
"I notice that "Taxpajcr" remarks
that the waj in which the police
man's salaries were raised was against
the laws of .Missouri and that the po
lice get ?1 for ever) arrest made
This is absolutclj wrong and niijone
who knows nn thing about the city
ordinances knows that it is wrong
In the first place the salaries of the
policemen were raised onlj after the
officers had resigned.
' And at the council meeting the
time the salaries were raised I made
absolutclj sure that the resignations
of the officers was absolutely uncon
ditional and without any expectation
whatever The Major told me that
the resignations were so and then I
instructed the Major and council that
thej were at liberty to appoint anj
other men for the offices that thej
could find who would take the work
at ?70 a month and give equally good
service. In other words when the
officers resigned they had no reason
to believe that they would be re-

BERLIN Aug. 2 The German su-pcr-submcrsible
Dcutschland eluded
at least eight English warships and a
whole fleet of American fishing
schooners in the employ of the Allies
when she dashed to sea from the Vir
ginia capes on the night of August 2,
it was learned here tonight.
Great crowds greeted Captain Koe-
nig and his crew when the first super
submersible to cross tne Atlantic re
turned to her home port, Bremen, last
night.
Captain Koenig had no fear of the
Allied warship patrol when he steam
ed south from Baltimore, but he had
not counted on the American schoon
ers hired to Help capture his vessel.
Passing out of the capes the
Dcutschland encountered a great
number of these schooners pling just
outside Chesapeake Bay.
Kvadi's .Vhooners ets.
The schooners had dropped their
nets, ostensibly to fish. Their real
purpose, however, Captain Koenig
said, was to make soundings for the
Dcutschland, aiming to signal Allied
warships if the submersible plunged
through their nets.
Koenig telegraphed the Ocean Companj-,
owners of the vessel, that the
American government observed cor
rect neutrality throughout the Deuts
chland's sta. He said that the United
States not only protected the subma
rine iii every way in her departure but
increased the precautions after a Brit
ish warship entered the port of Balti
more one night, presumably to recon
noiter. During the w hole journey the Dcuts
chland was submerged onl for 110
miles. The weather was splendid at
the beginning of her voyage but be
came stormy later, which delajcd the
Dcutschlaud's arrival several das.
On entering the North Sea, Koenig
said he encountered severe storms.
The Dcutschland proved herself an
excellent sea craft, her engines work
ing perfectlj, despite the fact that she
was .being rolled by mountain waves.
But few vessels were sighted and
not an iceberg was encountered The
Dcutschland promptly submerged when
another ship appeared on the horizon,
and her captain expressed doubt that
she had been seen by any other es
sel. The members of the crew were all
in good health and showed no sign of
having undergone anj- hardship.

marine Dcutschland was slightl
damaged on her return trip from the
United States, according to Bremen
dispatches toda. She took the same
route on her return trip as on the
first to Baltimore, the crew declared
The Bremen dispatches also carried
the statement that the submersible
Bremen, sister ship of the Dcutsch
land, only left for America a few daS
ago She was held in port until the
Dcutschland owners received positive
information that the Dcutschland had
eluded the British patrol along the
Atlantic Coast and probably would
reach Germany safely.
