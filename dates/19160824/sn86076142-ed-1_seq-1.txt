GOLD STRIKE

- A most- significant -4md . .important
strike has been made in the Belmont
claim of the TonopahJ Belmont Devel
opment company. It, is on the 1400
level a short distance west of the
shaft. Wild lutnora were immedi
ately circulated, one being that the
vein waa six inches in width and
that It ran 198 ounces in gold, to
gether with enough stiver to carry it
over the $4000 mark.
Frederick D. Bradshaw, general
manager of the Belmont, smiled when
a Bonanza representative told him of
the street goBslp. He aaid: "Go down
and look for yourself, sample,, assay
and deduct." By deduction he did
not mean to lessen, but to draw in
ferences. It will be impossible, how
ever, to inspect the strike until to
morrow morning, when Superintend
ent Fitzgerald makes hla rounds.
Until that time Mr. Bradahaw's brief
statement must suffice: "We have
encountered a vein three feet In
width. The formation la somewhat
broken. Only one round of shots has
been put in in each direction. All 1
can say at present is. that the values
are good and that gold is in preponderance."

CHICAGO, August 24. Edward W.
Morrlaon, a millionaire recluse, was
named In proceedings before Federal
Judge Landls as the real father of
two girla he recently adopted.
The accuser waa Joseph Burnsteln,
a Junk dealer. His wife, he declared,
confessed to him on ber deathbed
that Morrison waa the father of tbe
girla.
Tbe millionaire, who Is nearly $0
years old, denied the accusal Ion. Hla
reason for adopting the girls, he tas
tlfled, whs because their mother had
pleaded with blm, wbeu she waa
taken 1U, to care lor them. Ue had
known them all their lives, he Bald,!
and waa fond of them.
Anna, the eldest girl, is 18; her
aister, Alice, Is 16 years old. They
have made their home with Morrison
since their adoption about a month
ago.
The action before Judge Landls
waa a petition to appoint a receiver
for Morrison's propertlea, which have
been variously estimated in value
from $H. 000, (Hit) to $8,000.00. One of
the contentions was that Morrison
had adopted the two girls to prevent
the city of Chicago from receiving
tbe eat ate, which, under the will of
ata father waa to be a4 for educa
tional purposea If Morrison died
childless.
Morrison ia alleged to have given
away to certain friends during the
past seven years more than $2,000,000.
One of the transactions concerned
waa the transfer to James Ward, his
attorney, of property- on which the
Hotel Morrison stands. It la declared
to be worth more than $2,loo,000
