the Hawaiian Agricultural Company
and )t manager since 1904, is dead
by his own hand." Advices of his death
were, received by C. Brewer. & Co.,
agents for the company, yesterday
afternoon, but with the facts that he
had died and that his body would be
brought here the Information ended.
Wireless messages from HIlo after
Brewer & Co. had closed their offices
for the night Wednesday gave detaCs
of the finding of the body of j Ogg
lying near his automobile about 100
yards from the old Halfway ous en
the conntjrroad 'leading between Pa-
hala and the Volcano House. Close at
hand was a 32-callber revolver and he
had been shot in the month.
The .wireless state that although
Ogg had been absent from the plantar
tkm since Monday, his wife and those
at the plantation thought he had gone
to Htlo and felt no alarm. He had
spent , the morning of Monday with
the entomologist of the planters' assc
elation, O. H. Swerey, talking over
plantation matters and left him with

plague has affected the crop of the
plantation both thl year and last to
the extent of something like 6000 tons
and this had made the manager rather
clue, but more recently he had seem
ed to brighten up. That recently
there had been .dry weather was noth
ing unusual at Pahala and the agents
do not believe that business worries
can be blamed for his suicide. Friends
here who have long known him take
the same view.
William G. Ogg was a native of
Aberdeen. Scotland, and came to Ha
waii in 18S8 with James Gibb, who is
r.ow manager of the Honolulu Planta
Hon Company. He first went to Wala
kea, Hawaii, and became stable luna.
He rose rapidly until in six year he
became plantation manager for the

Plans are well under way for the

Several months ago local officers of
the coast artillery observed that in
making their calculations for the
flight of the big shells from the mor
tars, which go up as high as 12.000
or 15,000 feet, the projectile would
often fall so far wide of the mark as
to make it seem certain that the act
