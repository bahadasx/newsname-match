defeated the enemy in fresh fighting on
tho Struma Tiver, the Anglo-French
troops escaping by flight on the right
bank, said a Bulgarian -official state
ment received here today. In their
flight the allies abandoned several hun
dred dead.
"The ground near the villages of
Knikuey. Mevory and Towlova was cov
ered with enemy dead," the statement
continued.
"We have counted thus far 400 en
emy corpses, among them several of
ficers.. .We .captured 250 prisoners.
"A squad of hostile cavalry, lured
into our fire by the maneuvers of our
cavalry, was literally annihilated. '
("French attacks directed for 10
days against our positions south and
west of Doirau lake have failed com
pletely. This probably is the reason
why General Sarrill reports the cap
ture of places which have always been
in the hands of the allies, like the rail
road station at Doiran and the village
or uoiouayeu, which has not been
abandoned by the enemy. Our troops
buried 50 French dead on this sector.
"On the right bank of the Vardar,
we captured a hostile detachment near
Nayadagn and took one machine gun,
: the French leaving 70 dead. Our right
wing continues its operations."
Bulgars Attack Seres.
London, Aug. 24 The ancient citv of
Seres, 43 mijes northeast of Salonika,
is under attack by a strong Bulgarian
force, according to Athens dispatches
today.
The Greek garrison is co-operating
with Ffench forces in defending the
city. French artillery is replying vig
orously to a heavy Bulgarian 'bombard

rison is being reinforced by small
Greek detachments which retired upon
the city after spirited fighting with nu
merically superior Bulgarian forces.
On practically every other sector of
the Balkan front the Bulgarian offen
sive has been brought to a standstill.

San Francisco, Aug. 24. Following a
talc of an abduction from a jitney bus
by threo well dressed men, and deten
tion in a room for more than 30 hours,

peals over a telephone Tuesday, was

MAGNITUDE OF CRIME
Lovelace Brothers Self Con
fessed Murderers, Play
Happily in Jail Yard
Twin Falls, Idaho, Aug. 24. Facing
murder charges, Harold and Lynn Love
lacer aged 12 and 11 years, played hap
pily about the juvenile ward of the
county jail today. ' They apparently hail
no thought whatever of the killing ol
F. T. Hamill, to which they have con
fessed. Since their arrival in prison the boys
have been bathed and clothed iu ne.l
outfits. They have rigged up a method
of playing "one ole cat" with the jail
wall as a backstop. It is evident that
they are not doing any worrying aboui
their predicament, they have no horrol
of the Hamill killing and no concern
about the whereabouts of their mother
and stepfather. Every effort to locatt
the parents has resulted in failure.
The date for the Lovelace prelimin
ary hearing hns not been sot. It will
be held up until the district attorney
decides whether he shall go ahead and
prosecute the boys on a straight murdet
charge. Lynn, the younger, is alleged
to have actually fired the shot which
killed Hamill after the latter surprised
the boys robbing his house. Harold is
held as an accomplice.
Railroad Troubles
Make Market Cautious
New York, Aug. 24. The New York
Evening Sun financial review today
says:
irregular price tendencies marked the
greater pnrt of today's session with
movements at times distinctly in favor
of lower levels, without, however, the
accompaniment of active selling or any
particular change in sentiment regard
ing the prospects of further improve
ment in market values. The street was
conservatively bullish for the immed
iate future but the disposition of trad
ers and commission house customers was
to proceed with greater caution pending
the outcome of the railroad labor con
troversy and apparently to await de
velopments affecting a prominent muni
tion manufacturing company which
rumors suggested was having financial
difficulties.
To a great extent, especially in the
afternoon dealings, speculative interest
turned from the steel stocks to the cop
per issues in which price improvements
were recorded, especially in Inspiration
which sold to a new high, and Tennes
see copper.
Today 'a general market had for the
first time in. a week or more a two
sided appearance. Traders who took
profits on the advance were anxious to
bring about reactions in order to estab
lish new level for another rise and the
'public was less in evidence than report
ed in recent days.

Washington, Aug. 24. The climax in

Washington, Aug. 24. "Since mid

for the worst," declared a member of
the railway presidents' subcommittee
before the subcommittee left for the
White House at their own request this
afternoon to confer with the president.
"The situation is very serious." he
added..
The subcommittee, IJ. 8. Loveett of
the 1'nion Pacific, Daniel Willard of
tne naitunore and Ohio, and Hale rid

in session since 11 o'clock, to make the

progrum was arranged for her husband

ed, lie made one important speech here

liver a night speech at Salt Lake City.
In his morning speech here, Governor
Hughes enlarged on his dissertation re

stnte and the republican nominee's
thrust at the democrats was received
with enthusiasm.
It was announced today that Gover
nor Hughes will cut his stay at Estes
Park, Colo., to three days, shortening
nis schedule by one day all along the
line. This step was taken in order so
that the candidate will not be in Ken
tucky at the same time President Wil
son is there. The cfiauge in itinerary
will keep Hughes in St. Louis for two
days September 2 ahd 3. '
lue schedule for Hughes' Maine trm
has not been completed but it is report
ed the candidate will make at least two
speeches at Bangor and Portland
reaching New York about September 10.
Then Hughes hopes to rest for a couple
of days before starting out again on a
tour o'f New York state. He may speak
ai Syracuse or Albany Derore returning
to New York from his present tour,
leaving other un-atate points for his
second tour.
The tariff, federal employers' liabil
ity law and workmen's compensation
and his own labor record were discussed
by Hughes in his address at Reno last
night. lie discoursed on the necessity
of co-operation between capital and la
bor and declared "contented America
will be a successful America."
Ho also declured in favor of a world
court to settle controversies betwecu
nations, after the present war in Europe
ends.

HIRED MAN KILLED .
E
Roy Dudley Trying to Sell
Grain Causes Discovery
of His Crime
Olathe, Kan., Aug. 24. Roy Dudley,
arrested late yesterday charged with
the killing of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Muel
ler on their farm near Stillwell, 17 miles
southeast of her, admitted the killing
today, officials aaid. Dudley is report
ed to have said he quarreled with
Mueller over a team of mules and that
Mueller attacked him. To defend him
self, Dudley claims to have grabbed a
shot gun that was hanging over the
barn door and shot Mueller, then when
Mrs. Mueller attempted to interfere he
shot her.
Umciuls say Dudley did the shooting
Sunday, took possesion of the place and
hired a boy to help with the farm work
and then tried to sell part of the wheal
crop Mueller had raised. Tho double
murder was discovered whon Sheriff
Carroll went to Stillwell to arrest Dud
ley on a charge of stealing the wheat.
Carroll believes the crime was premedi
tated by Dudley. After tho killing
Dudley is said to have tied the bodies
together and drugged them to an
abandoned hoilfte a quarter of a mile
distant, where ho hid the bodies in the
cellar.
Dudley is an ex-convict. When neigh
bors questioned him, as to why he was
running the farm, alone, he said that
the Muellers had gone on a trip to
laiirormn.
$2.00 WHEAT PREDICTED
& . .
Washington, Aug. 24. Dlack
rust probably will be the cause .
of sending wheat prices soaring
to unheard of levels, with the
coming of the spring wheat out-
put, according to the United
States department of agriciil-
tore today. One official said
If- wheat now appears probable.
One of the must severe epi-
demies in black rust ever re-
corded has swept the wheat
belt of the northwest, with un-
precedented damage, predict-
lug a production far below nor-
mal.
Reports arriving at the de-
partmeut Hot only substantiate
the predictions of government
experts but It is said, tend to
place the loss at a far greater
figure, with correspondingly
high prices certain for the fall
anil winter.
The infected area Minneso-
ta and the two Dakotas pro-
duce, it is said, the greater
part of the spring crop.
