they caught him' up,' wrapped him in
a blanket, and hurried him. into the
canoe. , . .
As the canoe pushed off, Mr. Tin

scraping on the sand and rushed to
the shore. He shouted to the men to
stop, but they Ignored him and hur

Won't Move Local Busi
v ness.
Rumors to the effect that the Max
A ma Machine Co. might remove ..its
plant to another section of Connecti
cut was very clearly denied today by
Charles M. Ann, of Bridgeport and
Mt. Vernon, N. Y.
Incidentally it became known that
Mr. Ams had purchased the entire vil
lage of Turnerville, Conn., near Willl-
mantlc and will reconstruct It for the
purpose of manufacturings automo
biles. -, " ' ',' ' ' ;
The name Turnerville, which 'origi
nated because of the big carpet mills
formerly located there, will be chang
ed to Amstown and likewise the erec
tion of new concrete buildings on the
site of the old brick mill will be com
menced at onco.
Mr. Ams said today: "It is true that
I have bought the village of Turner
ville. I have also assumed the presi
dency of the Sterling Automobile Co.,
which is at present manufacturing a
small roadster. I shall actively en
gage in the automobile business, but
it should be understood clearly in
Bridgeport that the new cdncern has
nothing whatever to do with the local
Max Ams factory. The two concerns
are separate and distinct in every re
spect though I happen to be presi
dent of both.
"In my new venture, in which other
Connecticut persons are associated, we
shall manufacture two types of cars,
the roadster and a large touring car.
We shall attemupt to give the best
value for the money of any car on
the market and an expert corps-of
mechanical engineers is now engaged
in working eut details.
"Bridgeport need not worry about
the plant here for we have' no inten
tion of removing. The interests are
in nq way allied." .
From Willimantic it Is learned that
Mr. Ams contemplates and has already
begun enormous improvements. He
has proceeded to erect a big concrete
mill, has put all the other mills into
shape, has installed ' his own electric:
lighting plant, stocked a general store
for the cdmmunity . and greatly ' im
proved the old Turner homestead. In
fact he has turned a deserted village
into a thriving town to. be named afer
himself.
Other Connecticut "men said to be
interested in the venture are: Fred D.

R.R. DISPUTE,

Both Sides Are Optimistic
As President Continues
His Negotiations With
Employers and Workers;
Signs of Unrest Among Men
Have Disappeared And
Final Decision in Trouble
is Looked For Soon
Washington, Aug. 24 Re
newed optimism on the pros
pects for averting the threaten
ed railroad strike prevailed to
day among the representatives
of the employes and at ' the
White House.
Commissioner Chambers, of
the1 federal 'mediation board,
after conferring with President
Wilson carried a message to
the brotherhood leaders.
Signs of unrest among the men, so
apparent yesterday, disappeared today
and. there were renewed Indications
that the railroads would agree, on
some propbsal to ' Include the eight
hour day in a manner satisfactory to
the employes' committee and then
bring about investigation of all the
collateral issues.
: After conferences with representa
tives of the employes and employers.
Commissioner Chambers.- of the fed
eral mediation board, discussed the
strikd situation with President-Wilson
and made arrangements for a grpup
or the railroad presidents to see Mr.
Wilson immediately. There were 're
ports that a settlement of -the con
troversy was in sight, j
Hale Holden, of Burlington; Daniel
Willard, of the Baltimore & Ohio, and
. 8. Loyett, of the Union Pacific, me
sub-committee which has been dealing
with the President for the last two
days.arrived at the White House short
ly before 1 o'clock ' and refused to
make any statement before seeing the
President. ; , ; ' . '
After the conference it was said the
outlook, was "more hopeful If any
thing." u
The President sent for the execu
tives ia. acquaint them with the pro
gress being made by him in dealing
with the problems suggested at pre
vious conferences. ,
Railway heads who today con
tinued their efforts to meet President
Wilson's plan for averting a strike
probably had for their guidance in
formation on the administration's
attitude toward legislation or other
governmental , action looking toward
recompensing the'm for a possible
concession of the - eight-hour day
basis. - A definite . statement of this
was evidently the object sought.
Courses which might be taken in
Congress effecting directly the present
railway situation It was pointed out
as these: . . . ,
. Direct the Interstate commerce
commission by .resolution to Investi
gate the entire subject of the relations
between railroads and their employs.
Pas the pending bill to increase the
commission's membership from seven
to nine in , anticipation of additional
duties to be imposed.
.Bxact a measure competing arbi
tration' of future disputes similar to
that pending.
Establish the eight-hour day prin
ciple by legislation. .
Pass measures clearing the way for
government ownership of railroads. .
The first two proposals were receiv
ing most serious consideration, it was
said. Statements given out by the
railway presidents snowed no relaxa
tion in their opposition to the eight
hour principle and there was no direct
indication of when they might give a
final answer to President Wilson.1
Many, telegrams from Industrial and
commercial interest protesting against
granting the eight hour day were dis
played by the railway heads..
Administration officials expected a
final answer fromthe railrowl ex-ou-tives
today or tomorrow. President
Wilson made no engagemens In antici
pation of receiving tne- executives.
While no definite information is forth
coming, administration officials ex
pressed optimism over the outlook.
The executives had a meeting to
hear the sub-committee's report of the
conference last night with the Presi
dent. The men also had a meeting.
Walter D. Hlnes, chairman of the
executive committees of the' Sante Fe.
Issued a statement today attacking
President Wilson's plan and charac
terised it as preposterous. He declar
ed the President apparently had made
up his own mind without a hearing
"as to the concessions he will force
the employers to give to buy off the
labor from Its Illegal course."

STATE FEDERATION

Life of Every Guild in Con
. necticut Threatened If .
Plaintiffs Win.
Because the very life of every union
in Connecticut is threatened, the State
Federation of Labor, at its convention
next month, is expected to throw open
its treasury to the striking molders
of Bridgeport. '
The Central Labor union, .which rep
resents all the unions of the city, took
this action last night. It voted finan
cial and moral support to the molders
in theiri coming legal fight with the
manufacturers.
- This action was taken because It Is
realized that if the manufacturers, by
having recourse to what is called
"1296" by the labor men, win, It means
no more successful strikes in the state
until "1296,"the anti-plcketing statute,
Is repealed. ' '
The interpretation of this statute
in the recent action of the Max Ams
Cp. against the machinists, has showed
labor men the dangers of a law.whicb.
they thought, guaranteed ' them : the
right to do peaceful) picketing. ;'
The whole of the vast resources of
the labor unions in Connecticut may
be arraigned against the manufactur
ers before many weeks. Delegates
from Bridgeport will bring up the
matter at the state convention.
, At the meeting of the State Federa
tion's executive committee, Saturday,
plans will be laid for the fight in the
legislature against "1296." !
The Central Labor union received
information last night that in . the
neighborhood of 1,500 union men from
Bridgeport will board the special train
for the convention. The leaving time
will be announced in The Farmer at a
later date, it was decided.
