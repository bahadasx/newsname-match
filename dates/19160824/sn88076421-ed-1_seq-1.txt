Resolutions.
Whereas, the City Beautifying
League and the executive committee
thereof desire to express their appre­
ciation to those who have assisted in
making successful the Flower and
Vegetable Exhibition, be it therefore
Resolved—
1. That we express to the members
•f the Elks Lodge out lasting grati­
tude for their kindness and courtesy
in granting the League the use of
their beautiful home for the exhibi­
tion, and our entire appreciation of
their generosity in depriving them­
selves for so considerable a time of
its enjoyment that the purposes of the
League might be fulfilled. No more
harmonious setting for the displays
could have been desired, and the com­
forts, luxuries and privileges of the
reception rooms added immeasurably
to the pleasure of the visitors, and to
the success of the undertaking.

any
vices he rendered us, before, during
and after the exhibition, and for the
countless courtesies and the kindly
consideration he at all times accorded
us. His skill and experience in ar­
rangement was entirely responsible
for the effectiveness of the display,
and contributed largely to the success
of the exhibit.
3. That we express our great ap­
preciation of the consideration and
encouragement, as well as the large
amount of valuable space accorded us
by the newspapers of the city. We
realize that without this assistance
the League could have accomplished
very little.
4. That we express especial thanks
to the Optic-Reporter for the editorial
of August 19th which showed such en­
tire comprehension of the aims of the
League, and contained so much of val­
uable suggestion.
5. That we express our entire ap­
preciation of the aid given the cause
which the League would further by
the musicians who added greatly to
the evening's pleasure, by the ladies
of the city and by the wholesale
houses who furnished material for re­
freshments, by the ladies and young

gasoline and oil consumption, past
performances of Knight motored cars,

MET INSTANT DEATH
AT POPLAR, MONT.
Williston Railroad Man Fell From His
Engine and Fell Into Milk River
Near Poplar, Montana
Will McGrath, a well known Great
Northern engineer, was instantly
killed at the steel overhead bridge
just west of Poplar, Mont., last Thurs­
day afternoon. The accident happen­
ed in rather a peculiar manner. Mr.
McGrath was running west on No.
401. The fireman and brakeman were
on the steps leaning down looking for
a hot box on the tender and it is pre­
sumed that the engineer also went to
look out, when he lost his balance.
He may have tripped over the fire­
man's shovel. At any rate, he was
precipitated headlong from the en­
gine, striking the bridge and falling
into Milk river several feet below.

the last few years the land should be
disced well as soon as possible, fol­
lowed by a packer and then flax
should be sowed early in May."
Grew Winter Wheat
H. A. Catherman from north of the
city, experimented late last Septem­
ber by sowing a peck of wheat in
stubble. The wheat was just coming
out of the ground when the freeze-up
came, but it appeared early in the
spring and ripened along with the
rye. Catherman says the seed was
three years old and only a part of it
grew, but he secured 60 pounds of
fine plump wheat that was not touch­
ed by the rust. He is going to sow
this earlier this fall and hopes to have
it stooling well before the ground
freezes.

"One Wanderer Returned," has this

"Splendid England! If I were an

say this, but being a Scotchman, born
in Canada, I am free to express by un­
bounded admiration for the accomp­
lishments of the English soldiers dur­
ing the past three weeks of fighting
at the front. The whole history of the

folk—they'll have to alter its old name
of "Silly Suffolk'—and the like. Day
after day the simple narratives of
their doings in the Great Push are
making all our hearts glow. Here are
lads who go gladly to death if death
is necessary to save England. Here
are boys entering the very glory of
young manhood who present them­
selves cheerfully, wilfully, eagerly, for
their mother-country. Some joined
the army at great monetary sacrifice.
They go the more gladly for this.
I was talking a day or two ago with
a father whose son, a doctor, having
built up a practice bringing him close
on 2,000 pounds a year, was now called
upon to give it up to join the army. "I
don't know what win become of his
practice," said the father. I uttered
some words of sympathy. "You don't
imagine that my boy is sorry to go,
do you?" he said sharply. "Why, he
is rejoicing at the prospect like a
school boy off .for his holidays! What
does his practice matter anyway when
England has everything at stake?"
There spoke the true Englishman.
Scotland and England and the Domin­
ions are often, and are rightly, praised
for what they have done. But let us
tell sometimes of England. I myself
am certain that the records of a single
regiment properly told, a regiment
such as, for example, the "West
Kents," "The boys who never lost a
trench," would make an imperishable
addition to the nation's record of gol­
den deeds. Just as French is showing
on the heights of the Meuse and in the
valley of the Somme that the spirit
of the brave knights and squires and
bowmen who have fought so well and
so long in past centuries is inherited,
undimmed and undiminished in their
sons, so England is showing that we
need no longer go back to Agincourt
or Nasby or Trafalgar for examples
of what Englishmen can do. Living
examples in abundance are among us
today.

R. F. Hawley Kept in Jail for 31 Hours
at Davenport, Iowa—May Bring
Suit for Damages
Tuesdays Minneapolis Tribune con­
tained a story of the arrest of* R. F.
Hawley, a Williston, N. D., business
man, whose arrest occurred at Daven­
port, la.,- the first of the week. De­
tectives have been working on a num­
ber of cases, endeavoring to round up
the worst gang of auto thieves who
have ever operated in the United
States. Hawley was arrested as a
suspect and after he had been kept in
jail for 31 hours, without being al­
lowed to see an attorney, his compan­
ion, who by the way, is a detective,
managed to send word to his attorney,
and both were let out. The men state
that they were subjected to indigni­
ties and are talking of bringing a suit
for damages against the Davenport
authorities.
Hawley formerly resided in Minot,
where he was engaged in the cigar
manufacturing business. He passed
through here last week enroute east
with a string of race horses.
Paper House Locates Salesman Here
Wright, Barrett & Stihvell Co.,
wholesale paper dealers of St. Paul,
have written the secretary of the As­
sociation of Commerce that they have
decided to locate a man in Minot to
look after this territory, with special
reference to the city of Minot, where
he will have his home. Mr. Leo Golisch
has arrived in the city as their repre­
sentative, and as soon as he secures
living quarters will remove his family
to this city. The letter from Wright,
Barrett & Stilwell Co. reads in part
as follows:
"For some time past our house has
been watching the wonderful growth
of Minot, and the ever-increasing pop­
ulation of the surrounding territory,
and feel that it is time to make a divis­
ion of our North Dakota territory so
that we can have a man living in Mi­
not in order that he may be able to
keep in close touch with the trade
there as well as being in a better po­
sition to work tnat northwest terri­
tory."
This is but another straw to show
that Minot is gradually coming into
its own. It will not be long before
some large paper house will see fit to
locate a branch house in this city.
Earl Champlin Lost Little Boy
Mr. and Mrs. Earl Champlin, who
recently moved to Wolf Point, Mont.,
are mourning the death of their nine
months-old son, wlto was ill for sev­
eral days with spinal meningitis. Mrs.
Champlin and babe had arrived at
Wolf Point only two days before the
child's death occurred. Mr. Champlin
was engaged in the grain business at
Genoa for several years, locating at
Wolf Point recently where he is inter­
ested in the Champlin Implement Co.
Mr. and Mrs. Champlin have the sin­
cere sympathy of their many friends.
