GOOD PROGRAM
ABLY RENDERED
As the vacation season is drawing to
a close and an adjournment of the
Thursday Morning Music Club is now
at hand, the programs seem to be more
beautiful, and the interest of each mem
ber quickened in their enjoyment. '
The following program was rendered
yesterday at the home of Miss Loraine
Tav ev :
Tye Largo................................Handel
........Mr. Robbins and Miss Dubois
Solo—O, Thou Who Tells Glad Tid
ings ................... Handel
................................Mrs S. W. Wilson

;.......................... Miss Bertha Olsen
A Snague .......,................Miss J. Brokaw
i inclinons ................................ Bach
Miss Millick, Miss Tavey, Miss
....................-Dubois and Miss Capps
The closing musical morning will be
Thursday, August 21, when the life of
Gluck will Vie considered, and a fare
v -'ll program will be rendered from the
different composers whose lives have
been studied during the summer. It is
hoped that a class in harmony will be
formed, also that an orchestra may be
developed from High School talent.
Black foot High has the talent, and its
interest can be aroused sufficiently to
warrant the undertaking. We feel that
an orchestra will add greatly to the
school life, for music is the greatest
influence in force in developing har
monious lives.
If there was any lingering doubt in
the mind of any citizen in Blackfoot
as to whether all the children loved
stories, glimpse in at the City Ball
Library last Friday would have dis
pelled all such doubts. A more inter
ested group of children ranging in ages
from 1! to 12, would have been hard to
find. Over fifty children were there,
and the Story Telling Lady held their
interest throughout so that one could
hear a pin drop, only when they were
impersonating some part of the story.
The influence of the Blackfoot Free
Library is already being felt in this
community, and Blackfoot owes a vote
of thanks to the ladies who have made
it possible. Seventy children secured
cards and permission to take books
home. The Story Telling Lady will
greet her little friends again Friday
exactly at four o'clock. A group of
children wil dramatize the story of the

THE RANGE CAYUSE
The models of travel are varied
Since the aeroplane's in use,
But to drive away care
There's none can compare
With the back of the range cayuse.
Thoroughbreds aren't in it,
No matter how trim and spruce,
For. they lark the vim
That is born in him,
The little range cayuse.
Endurance, you bet he lias it,
lie'll stand all sorts of abuse,
And through rain nr snow
Like the wind he'll go,
The faithful range cayuse.
With the West of his day he's passing
To oblivion and disguise,
But our hearts beat fast
When we think of the past
Ami of you, old range cayuse.

WOMEN OF WOOD
CRAFT PICNIC
Last Thursday at the beautiful coun
try lieuie of Mrs. Martha Laroqiie, five
miles west of town, about twenty live
ladies, Women of Woodcraft, enjoyed
a very pleasant day. They arrived in
autos about 10 o'clock in the morning
and spent a short time on the shady
lawn playing cards and doing fancy
work. At 1 o'clock tables laden with
all the good things the market affords
were spread on the grassy, green lawn,
and such a spread. Talk about hard
times. There was no indication of them
there. After the ladies were seated
hostess appeared with young chicken,
mashed potatoes and cream gravy.
Everyone of the fair waitresses done
their duty without much urging and
with marked courtesy and kindness.
After resting for about an hour some
of the ladies enjoyed a swim in the
canal near by, while the more dainty
and timid ones stood on the bank and
shouted words of encouragement and
sympathy to their wet and shivering
companions. Again rest and games on
the lawn was resorted to, after which
a, lunch served ealTateiia style was en
joved in the house. There were fat lad
ies races, lean ladies races and short
ladies races. At 6 1*. M. all started
home declaring Neighbor baroque one
of the best hostesses they ever knew.
These affairs an annual event as to so
thoroughly enjoy one self with good
thoughts, beautiful surroundings and
such good eating, is n benefit in more
wavs than one to Women of Woodcraft.
The Ladies' Aid of the M. E. Church
will open a lunch booth on the corner
of Main and Pacific during the last
two days of the Fair, and your patron
age is solicited
