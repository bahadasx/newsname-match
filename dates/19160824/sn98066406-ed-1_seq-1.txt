The Year of Thrift
I
W it $
This year marfts the anni
versary of the establish
ment Of the first savings
banK in the United States.
In commemoration of this
centennial, banKers' organ
izations are speeding up the
thrixt movement.
Strangely enough, this ef
fort comes at a time when
national progress in com
merce and industry depend
on the people's power to
save.
No longer can America
draw on the savings of the
thrifty people of Europe for
capital with which to de
velop its resources.
From now on the United
States must produce its own
capital.
An account in a savings banK insures
national progress and your own inde
pendence. -

Entertainments of High
Class Afternoons and
Evenings.
Chautauqua, the much looked for
ward to event of the Bummer, has for
the third time, come and cone for the
citizens of Yale and vicinity, but the
enthusiasm remains and the live days,
so lull of pood things, will linger in our
memories to such Rood purpose that
Chautauqua will be bound to make
Vale its Flopping place lor years to
come.
l h inestimable good which in cer
tainly accomplished by bringing these
noted speakers, these line entertainers,
the best the world over, in contact with
our people, is surely worth w hile.
There is no question but wnai we an
feel the better and much the better, for
the feast of good things which we have
just enjoyed and which we shall go on
enjoying as these things leave a lasting
impression with us making us better
men and women ana belter utung us
lor living our lives usefully and hap
pily.
Dont we an leei mat auer mesmiin-
Spring-Holmes Company, the lirst day s
entertainment, that it was something
well worth while, something that we
are sun remembering ana enjoying
and in the evening, that line lecture of
Dr. Uradiords "Americas Destiny."
Wasn't that great? Didn't you get
your money's worth that day 'i
Ana the secona aay wun me won
derful address by Mr. Miller and the
remarkable recital by the Haweis, the
native New Zealauders, with their
quaint costumes and native songs and
iilustratea sketches. v no aia noi una
mueh pleasure and knowledge in these
numbers.
The third day the charming concert
bythelleulah Uuck Concert company
and another grand lecture by the fa
mous Dr. 1'rederick K. Hopkins on
4,Coinmunity;iluilding" more than made
an overllow of good things but more
yet was to come.
The fourth aay was canea neauu
Day and was devoted exclusively to Dr.
Charles K. Barker, who gave two strong
interesting and instructive lectures on
'Health and Happiness" and "How to
Live a Hundred 1'ears" with eplendid
ideas and good advice.
The lifih day brought the celebrated
Kryl band with Frank Kryl as director
and lifteeu members. The concerts,
both afternoon aud evening were great
and an immense audience were delight
ed with every number.
An hour each morning was devoted
to the children In story telling and
practicing for the culminating program
on the last evening in the Mother lioose
Festival.
This entertainment was highly
charming aud the young folk conduct
ed themselves very creditably under the
able direction of .wise Collins aud Miss
Vork.
This day fittingly brought to a climax
Chautauqua week and all could be sat
isfied with the varied and spicy pro
cram given us by the Hedpath peoplei
Mr. Hendrickson, supt., has been
with us twice and is exceedingly well
liked. We hope to see him here again
next year. His helpers have also been
louud courteous ,und likable young
men.

Big Family Reunion.
On Monday of this week the Murray
families held a family reunion at the
home of Otto Hawker in Greenwood
township. Those present were Mr. and
Mrs. Kobert Murrav. Ola wnson, wue
and family, E. F. Murray and family
and Blanche Murray, of Brown City;
Frank Ha 11 and fam v or L.ynn; Airs.
Veru White, of Elk Kapids; F. II.
Campbell and family, of baglnaw;
Koht. Murrav and ramuv. or laie.
A iollv flrood social time was enjoyed
by all present. Flenty of eatables were
previously prepared and a big reea
was relished by the company. It was
voted that an annual affair be made of
this occasion.
Work of County Agriculturist
A considerable portion of the work
last week was of a more or less miscel
aneous nature. Looee ends were pick
ed up here and there and the work was
put in shape to leave during the nine
days that the County Agent will be
absent. Tuesday afternoon some time
was spent in Kenockee township on
the household convenience project and
a marl investigation was made on the
farm of S. J. Lambkin. Mr. Lambkin
has un abundance of marl coming very
close to the surface and all appearances
Indicate that it will be a prolitable
source of lime for acid soils. A quan
tity was collected from different spots
and has been sent to the Experiment
Station Chemist at East Lansing lor
analysis. It is impossible to judge the
richness of the material by the appear
ance but it is hoped and believed that
it contains a high percentage of car
bonate of lime.
Two important meetings alsoclairaed
attention. On Wednesday the China
Farmers' Club was attended in the
groye near the Gleaner Hall. This
being children's day, no very active
part was taken in the program, but Mr.
Waldron of the Michigan Agricultural
College was secured to address the
people on the subject of "Boys' Cow
TeBting Clubs" which the State and
county Agriculturists are planning to
get started in the county the coming
fall. It is believed that this kind of a
club will be found well adapted to the
conditions in St. Clair county and that
it is one which will enable the boys to
compete with others in any part of the
state. A definite plan or organization
has not yet been entirely completed
and the matter will be explained more
fully in a later paper.
The Farmers' Picnic at Smith Creek
which was held on Thursday was at
tended by about live hundred people.
A talk was given by the county agent
on "Problems and Progress in Agri
culture in St. Clair county." While a
picnic audience is not usually interest
ed in substantial questions, the atten
tion and interest Bnown were excellent
and considering the number present, it
constituted a splendid opportunity to
meet the people. Also many questions
of interest to those present were dia
cussed informally with several of the
different people during the day.
Interest in the hay growers' meeting
at Capac, September 5th, for the pur
pose of organising a cooperating hay
marketing association is increasing
rapidly. Judging by the comments
heard, leaders in the different localities
having evidently been busy explaining
the matter to their neighbors and
creating a favorable sentiment. Co
operative selling associations are in
creasing in number very rapidly and
have demonstrated their emciency to
both the buyer and the consumer.
There are now about forty thousand
farmers' cooperative marketing associ
ations In the United States. The or
sanitation will be completed at Walkers
Hall, Capac, September 5th at 2 p. m ,
and the indications are that nearly
every hay producer In the western part
ot the county will be present. Any
one who has hay to market caunot af
ford to miss this meeting.
Work will be resumed again on Au
gust Both.
