The Germans also launched

ground, but the attack was re
pulsed after a fierce struggle,
London claims.
The defeat of the entente
forces along the Struma river

tentes took flight, leaving the
ground covered with their
dead and that four hundred
dead bodies were counted on

Another subject that has .-oma in

up over the state for a dome on the

assembly have given out interviews on
the subject, all of them being in ta.-
or of the dome even if it shall cost
the $250,000 that it Is said will be the
expense of building it. One member
if the senate who is a physician, says
the building looks like a hospital
without a dome on it.

counter-charges made and it Is time
that the public should see sh iw
down." This is about the sentiment
of every one Interviewed o.i tin sub
ject There has been a court of In
quiry going on In this county from
time to time during the past year,
but a consultation of the convictions
had in the courts i not very encour
aging from the expense Involved, but
a grand jury may be conducive of but
ter results.
Just what the particular Investiga
tion will be has not been clearly
defined by any of the county officials,
but thai there will be a general shake
up is apparent and all the county
officials are welcoming It as they
want the public to know Just what
is going on.
Aside from the county officials
there are other matters that are going
on in the city and county which need
lnvest!gating. according to a state
ment of the ceunty officials, and ev
erything mill be thoroughly Investi
gated while the tribunil Is In session
as It is costing the taxpayers money
and they want results for what they
are expending.
