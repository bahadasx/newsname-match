EYES WITH ACID
Storage Battery Blows up and
Throws Sulphuric Acid
Pnto His Face.
VISION SAVED BY BATH
IN SODA; NOW SERIOUS
Ignited Hydrogen Gas With
Flame Before Battery
Was Complete.
Ocar Shivelbine, member of one of
Capo's most prominent families and
talented musician, had both eyes filled
with sulphuric acid yesterday morn
ing when a storage Lattery with which
he was working exploded.
Late last night, Dr. W. E. Yount de
clared that he believes the sight of
both eyes will be saved, although their
condition now is considered exceed
ingly dangerous. If the eyesight is
saved it will probably be due to the
prompt action of Oscar Hirsch in
starting to bath Loth eye-balls with a
soda solution that neutralized the acid
and robbed it of its burning ability.
The accident occurred shortly before
11 o'clock yesterday morning at the
Hirsch home at "18 South Frederick
street, where both young men were at
work with the storage batteries. Mr.
Hirsch has an establishment for re
filling storage batteries.
Shivelbine was engaged in refilling
a battery when the explosion occurred.
In the operation of filling the batter
ies, -the chemical ipwetion inside-the
battery liberates hydrogen gas, which
is a high explosive when it is confined
and is exposed to a flame.
This gas is confined in the battery
in such a manner that should a flame
be taken near, an explosion would oc
cur. It is necessary to blow the gas
out of the storage batteries before the
refilling has been completed.
Shivelbine yesterday was working
with r. form of battery that was new to
him ?nd when he blew out the hydro
gen gas, he failed to get all that was
confined in the battery.
As a consequence, a few seconds aft
er he had finished blowing and moved
the battery near a flame, the explo
sion resulted. It threw the solution
of sulphuric acid, which is left in the
battery, over his face and into his
eyes.
His cries and the noise of the explo
sion attracted the attention of Hirsch
who turned to the solution of soda at
hand and used that in bathing Shivel
bine's eyes.
Dr. Yount was communicated with
at once and he ordered the soda bath
to continue until he could arrive at the
place and look after the case. After
the soda had been used freely for sev
ral moments, Shivelbine opened the
lids of his eyes, and although the pain
was excruciating, he found that he
could see with both eyes.
He said, however, that a thin veil of
yellow seemed to cover his eyes and
mar his vision.
After the arrival of the doctor his
eyes were bandaged, and last night it
was said that he will have to remain
quiet for several days. Dr. Yount said
that the effect of the acid will not
be as bad as it was expected at first.
The sulphuric acid was a weak solu
tion, it was said.
Shivelbine went to his home yester
day where he now is staying at 303
South Spanish street.
FIRES SHOTGUN ON ROAD
Robert F. McLain Makes Complaint
Against Two Jackson Boys.
Warrants yesterday afternoon were
issued for the arrest of two boys, Gale
Godwin and Elvin Hedrick, both of
Jackson, charging them with shooting
firearms on the public roads.
The complaint against the two boys
was made at Jackson before Prosecut
ing Attorney J. Henry Caruthers by
Robert F. McLain, a farmer living
about three miles this side of Jackson
on the Cape-Jackson road.
He asserted that they got in front
of his house Tuesday night about 8
o'clock and discharged a shotgun eight
times. Late yesterday the boys had
not been arrested.
2 i GIRLS CAUGHT

NARROW ESCAPE
Runaway Machine Backs
Over Tots and Pins Them

TOY WAGONS SMASHED;
THEY AVOID WHEELS
Grown-ups Watch as Mary Caton
and Catherine Sherrill
Are Struck.
Two little girls Mary Caton and
playmate, Catherine Sherrill miracu-
ously escaped dangerous injuries be
neath the wheels of a runaway auto
mobile, when they were run down by
the car in front of the Caton girl's
liome on Bessie street Tuesday even
ing.
Details of the accident became
known last night, and at the same time
it was said that both children are re
covering from the shock and minor
bruises and scratches they sustained.
The children were playing on Bessie
street, riding in a small wagon owned
by Jack Bergman, one of their com
panions. Young Bergman is a son of
A. W. Bergman of Bessie street.
The runaway automobile is owned
by James Lovell of 1436 Bes:-ie street,
and it had been stopped in front of the
Lovell home in the evening by Odell
Lovell, 18-year old son of Mr. Lovell.
The car had not been backed into the
curb, however, to. hold on the hill at
that point, and suddenly" the brake be
came released when there wa no one
in or near the machine.
The car slowly started down the hill
and several yards further down the
hill the two little girls were playing
with the wagon. They were directly
in the path of the backing machine.
The car gained speed as it continued
down the hill.
Several men and women sitting on
their front porches watched the ma
chine back down the hill and saw the
children in the path of the car, but
made no effort to sound a warning,
because they believed that Odell Lovell
occupied the driver's seat and would
sound the car's horn.
The two children afterward said
they saw the machine approach but ex
pected it to be guided past them and
thought the driver would sound a horn.
As a consequence, in the full view
of nearly a dozen spectators, the ma
chine smashed into the little wagon
occupied by the two girls and stalled
to pass over them. The children were
knocked to the ground with the
wheels passing on either side of their
wheels passiog on either side of their
bodies and not touching them.
After the car had passed nearly over
them, it was stopped by the combined
obstructions of the two children and
the debris of the wagon which had
been smashed to bits beneath the
wheels of the motor car.
Men who witnessed the accident ran
to the rescue of the children, but were
unable to extricate the two girls, by
reason of the fact that they were pin
ned too tightly beneath the machine.
Not until Odell Lovell had started
the engine and slowly -moved the caj;
offi of them was it possible to get thorn
from beneath the car.
Neither of the two girls was in
jured seriously. The Caton girl. is a
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. E. A. Caton,
the insurance man of 1429 Bessie
street, and the Sherrill child is a daugh
ter of A. W. Sherrill of 417 North
Boulevard.
Yesterday after the initial accident
with the Lovell machine, Odell Lovell
had his left arm badly wrenched and
sprained when he was cranking the
machine. The engine back-fired as he
endeavored to crank the car and the
handle of the crank jerked his arm so
that the muscles of the entire arm and
left shoulder were badly sprained. The
elbow also was injured.
A doctor was summoned last night
and found the muscles swollen, and he
declared that it will be several days
before young Lovell will be able to use
the arm and shoulder.
LAMM'S FRIENDS
TO AID HI, BUT
NOT HELP DICKEY
Steam Roller Divides Party
Into Two Factions,
Leaders Believe.
ST. LOUIS FRIENDS
CONDUCT LAMM CLUB
Will Ignore State Committee,
Which is Antagnostic to
Candidate for Governor.
Jefferson City, Aug. 23. The hu
miliation of Judge Henry Lamm, Re
publican nominee for Governor, by the
Republican State Committee, bossed
by Walter S. Dickey of Kansas City,
Republican nominee for United States
Senator, resulted in a revolt bv the
Lamm supporters in the State Com
mittee yesterday afternoon and the
immediate inauguration of plans to
conduct a separate campaign in the in
terest of Judge Lamm.
Judge Lamm, who won his nomina
tion in the primary election in the face
of the opposition of the Dickey-con-troled
State Committee, made a per
sonal plea to Dickey and to members
of the new State Committee for a
state chairman who was at least
friendly to him, but Dickey was inex
orable and refused to recognize that
Jude Lamm had any right whatever
to a friendly state organization. He
forced the re-election of T. W. Huk
riede of Warrenton, after Judge Lamm
at the request of Jeptha Howe had
withdrawn Howe as a candidate, and
after Lamm had also suggested as
chairman his life-long friend, John H.
Bothwell of Sedalia.
The Lamm supporters charged that
Dickey was not satisfied with being
nominated for United States Senator,
but that he wanted to be the absolute
party boss. Otto V. Stifel of St. Louis
resigned from the State, Committee
declaring that he did not wish to be a
member of a body that would deliber
ately humiliate its party's candidate
Governor, and Bothwell Mark Dodd,
Republican Committeemen from the
Tenth District, and Dr.'j. H. Barto,
Republican nominee for Congress in
the Eleventh District, holding the
proxy of the two members from that
district, walked out of the meeting of
the State Committee and refused to
participate in the proceedings when
Hukriede was elected.
Nearly all Republican leaders here
agree that Judge Lamm will be 2r,000
votes stronger in the November elec
tion than Dickey, and that it would
have been good politics for Dickey to
have yielded to Judge Lamm.
When both Howe and Bothwell were
turned down by Dickey, Judge Lamm
felt the humiliation very keenly, and
stated that he had gone to the peo
ple for his nomination and would, go
again to the people for his election.
The Lamm headquarters in St. Louis
have never been closed, and they will
conduct his campaign for election.
The convention completed its work
this afternoon by the adoption of a
platform which contained a ringing de
nunciation of the present Democratic
administration in Missouri. Nearly
every department under Major was
criticised. The Democrats were charg
ed with bringing the state to a condi
tion of almost bankruptcy with great
extravagance, with looseness in finan
cial affairs by the overappropriaton of
state revenues by millions of dollars
and of using" the police and Election
Boards of some of the cities for par
tisan advantage.
On national issues the platform con
tains an indorsement of the national
platform, declares in favor "an Amer
ican citizenship which shall be uncon
ditionally loyal to those principles of
individual lberty and representatve
government upon wheh the republic
was founded," for a protective tariff;
for a foreign policy that will protect
the rights of American citizens at
home and abroad; for a dignified and
firm foreign policy, and for the pro
tection of American lives and rights in
Mexico. .
Taking up state issues, the platform
declares that "our State Government is
in the hands of a selfish political ma
chine which cares nothing for . the

WADDELL FIELDS
GIVEN A PAROLE
Accomplice in $750 Forgery Job
Goes Free Banker
Tindle Freed.
Through the efforts of Senator
Thomas F. Lane, his attorney, Wad-
dell Fields, who was sentenced to three
years in the penitentiary when con
victed of being an accomplice to Lar
kin J. Flannigan in forging a check
for $750 at the Sturdivant Bank, has
been paroled by Lieutenant Governor
Painter.
Senator Lane yesterday was notified
of his client' parole and he is expect
ing a visit from Fields within the next
few days.
Fields' parole was announced simul
taneously with that of A. C. Tindle, de
faulting cashier of the old Pemiscot
County Bank at Caruthersville, who
was paroled to R. F. Bryan of Mem
phis, Tenn.
Application for Fields' release from
the penitentiary was made several
months ago by Senator Lane on the
importunement of his relatives who re
side in Memphis. The application was
approved by the prosecuting witness
against him. President W. H. Stubble-
field of the Sturdivant Bank, Prose
cuting Attorney J. Henry Caruthers
and Judge Frank Kelly.
It had been pending for several
weeks. Fields was caught in Cairo
with his companion Flannigan after
the pair had made their getaway from
the Cape with the $750 which Flanni
gan obtained at the bank. Testimony
in the trial also disclosed that he had
been seen in the Cape with Flannigan.
Fields has a wife living in Memphis
and he has close relatives there who
are strong politically.
$ Tindle, who was paroled, embezzled
more than $200,000 of his bank's funds
and lost the money in speculation in
cotton. When his peculations were
discovered he. made restitution to the
extent probably of $150,000 by giving
up all of his own property as well as
that of his wife.
Ten other paroles also were an
nounced at Jefferson City.
COUNCILMAN BLACK SICK
Had
Severe Attack of Malaria and
Suffered Chills Yesterday.
City Councilman W. D. Black last
night went to his home in a serious
condition suffering with a severe at
tack of malaria and fever. For sev
eral weeks Mr. Black declared he has
been suffering with a mild attack of
malaria which he has been trying to
fight down.
Yesterday when the cool weather
passed over the Cape, the change in
temperature meant chills for Mr. Black
and he suffered a severe chill yester
day afternoon. His fever mounted to
above 100.
He is planning to take a vacation
and regain his health at some resort in
this section of Missouri.
DICKEY WILL PAY
HIS CAPE FRIENDS
Notifies Colored Republicans
They Will be Reimbursed
For Efforts.
Walter S. Dickey, Republican nomi
nee for United State Senator, is
threatening fo shake up his "distribut
ing committee" in Cape Girardeau
County, because the colored Republi
cans were not reimbursed for money
they spent in Mr. Dickey's behalf dur
ing the recent primary campaign. He
has announced that he will take his pen
in hand within a few days and sign
some checks to cover the cost of get
ting the full Dickey strength to the
polls in this county.
Several weeks before the primary
election, Mr. Dickey's secretary wrote
personal letters to several influential
colored Republicans, urging them to do
what they could for Mr. Dickey's can
didacy. "Call upon Mr. Harry Naet
er," said Mr. Dickey's secretary, "and
he will help you out."
Rev. S. S. Pitcher, one of the active
negro Republicans in Jackson devoted
considerable time to the interests of
Mr. Dickey, even going go far as to
spend money for circulars and other
incidentals in Mr. Dickey's behalf.
Following the instructions from Mr.
Dickey's secretary, Rev. Fitcher called
upon Editor Naetcr and requested that
he (Naeter) reimburse him for the
work he had performed for Mr. Dickey.
Mr. Dickey's stakeholder informed
Rev. Pitcher that he could not have
any of the Dickey money unless he
took his friends down the line for John
E. Swangcr and H. S. Wilson. Rev.
Pitcher, being a supporter of Judge
Lamm, said he would do nothing for
Mr. Swanger. He also declared that
his influence could not be bought.
W. H. Rodney, one of the influential
Republican negroe3 of this city, also
received a letter from Dickey's secre
tary, requesting him to call upon Ed
itor Nactor, who was handling the
Dickey primary barrel. Mr. Rodney
likewise went to considerable expense
in behalf of the senatorial candidate,
but Editor Naeter refused to tilt the
Dickey barrel to reimburse Rodney un
less he could line up the colored vote
in the Cape for Swanger and Wilson.
None of the colored friends of Dickey
in Cape County were paid back the
amount they spent in Dickey's behalf,
but Dickey has been told personally
about the matter. A representative
colored man of this city called upon
Candidate Dickey, a few days ago, and
placed the matter before him. "I
want the the boys to be taken care
of," was Mr. Dickey's statement, "and
I will see to it that they are. I am
surprised to learn these facts."
Because of these indiscretions, it is
said, Mr. Naeter will not be permitted
to tamper with Mr. Dickey's barrel
during the present campaign. It is
presumed that all vouchers will here
after be made out in Kansas City, thus
abolishing the office of local change
man.

Germany Elated at Feat of
Merchant Submarine-
Dived Into Port.
EOENIG SAYS CRAFT
ENJOYED FINE TRIP
Sea Dock Left British Cruisers
Waiting on the Line as It
Pot to Sea.
Special Dispatch to The Tribune.
Bremen, Aug. 2.5. The German
merchant submarine, Deutschland, ar
rived at the mouth of the Weser River
late this afternoon and steamed to
Bremen, arriving tonight. The ves
sel passed under the allied warships
which were waiting for it out of the
harbor. Its appearance at the mouth
of the Weser River was the occasion
for a wild demonstration all over Ger
many. The news of the undersea
craft's safe voyage was quickly flash
ed to Berlin and other important cities.
Capt. Koenig said tonight that his
voyage from Baltimore was without
incident. He said the Deutschland
submerged before it reached the three
mile line, where it passed out of
American waters. The undersea craft
dived under the line of British cruis
ers without their knowledge and then
put to sea, still under water.
Instruments on the Deutschland
kept the submarine crew informed
when they came near an enemy war
ship. They were within shell distance
of British war vessels on several oc
casions on the homeward trip, but
were never detected.
Capt. Koenig was heralded as a real
hero. Ever- member of his crew is
in excellent condition, and expressed
a desire to repeat their feat.
London, Aug. 23. The situation in
the Balkans continues to hold first
place in the war news. The Bulgarian
advance into Greece continues on a
150-mile Greeco-Italian front. The Al
lies are holding ground in the center
and have advanced in places. Reports
from Saloniki say tha Greeks continue
to rush troops to oppose further in
vasion. London, Aug. 23. Everywhere on
the 250-mile battle front, from the
Pripet marshes to the Carpathians, the
general offensive launched by the Rus
sians in the first days of July, was
brought to a standstill, and at some
points, particularly in Volhania, in
Northeast Kovel, east of Lemberg and
in the Carpathians, the Austro-Ger-man.4
launched successful counter at
tacks. Terrific fighting continues, but
the advantage of the new movement is
in the favor of the Germans. The Ger
man captured several thousand men
and some large guns, according to the
midnight official statement from Ber
lin. Berlin, Aug. 25. German troops re
captured a trench taken by the French
near Estrees in figthing last night
south of the Somme, it was announced
officially this afternoon. Between
Thiepval and Poxieres the English
made repeated attacks, but were re
pulsed. HUGHES' WHISKERS WIN
HIM ONE VOTE
Atlanta, Ga., Aug. 23. "We men of
whiskers must stand together," de
clares William E. Saxton, a gallant ex
Confederate soldier, pioneer realty
owner and possessed of a beard which
might be the envy of a Mohammedan
prohpet. "We must vote down can
didates who use the safety razor
every morning," and carrying out
these sentiments, Mr. Saxton says he
will break a life-long Democratic rec
ord this fall by voting for the whis
kered candidate, Charles E. Hughes.
Saxton's whiskers are 18 inches long,

RAIfcLCHIEFS AND
WILSON CONTINUE
STRIKE CONFABS
Presidents Say They Can't
Accept Present Demands
of Workers.
CONGRESS IS ASKED
TO HELP AIM OUT
Eight-Hour Day Law May Force
Railroads to Accept
Men's Demands.
Washington, Aug. 23. Hale Holden,
Daniel Willard and Judge Lovett, rep
resenting the railroad presidents, call
ed upon President Wilson tonight, and
were in a conference from 8:30 until
10 o'clock, in an effort to reach an
agreement.
Neither the railroad executives nor
the President would discuss what had
been accomplished, but it is understood
that the railroad heads informed Mr.
Wilson that the plans for a settlement,
so far as proposed, were impossible to
accept. They gave President Wilson
to understand, however, that they were
endeavoring to come to some agree
ment and that hope had not yet been
exhausted.
The railroad chiefs conferred with
31 1. Wilson after he had turned t
Congress today for support of his de
mand for an eight hour day as an
equitable means of avoiding the strike.
He was informed by the leaders of the
powerful Congressional committees,
treated to deal with matters relating
to Interstate Commerce, that Congress
undoubtedly has power to pass an
eight hour day law, effecting railroad
employes.
This indicates that if the railroads
do not yield they will face legislation
to compel submission. It is believed
they will finally give in to President
Wilson, although there is on tangible
indication tonight.
The plan which the railroads execu
tives presented at the last conference
at the White House, is said to have
exacted guarantees so numerous as to
constitute a serious stumbling block.
They wanted assurances of an increase
of five per cent in freight rates; that
legislation would be enacted to pre
vent a repetition of the preseit
trouble.
The President is said to have re
mained firm and refused to urge any
legislation that the railroads desired.
The Brotherhoods, he told the railroad
chiefs, are becoming impatient while
railroads kill time in an effort to cre
ate public sentiment.
Another conference will be held at
1 1 o'clock tomorrow morning.
BRINGS WIFE TO HOSPIT L
Mrs. Sarah Tanner May Hae Opera
tion Performed Today.
Mrs. Sarah Tanner, wife of Sylves
ter Tanner a farmer living two and a
half miles southwest of Brownwood,
last night was brought to the Cape on
the Hoxie and taken to St. Francis'
Hospital in an ambulance.
It is believed that she is suffering
with an advanced stage of appendicitis
and it is probable that an operation
will be performed today. Mrs. Tan
ner is 54 years old. She first became ill
a week ago last Sunday when she suf
fered severe cramps in the stomach.
She has been confined to her bed
since then, and the attacks of cramps
have often been repeated. She was
accompanied to the Cape by her hus
band and a son.
HUNTERS KILL THREE
WOLVES NEAR GILLIAM
Gilliam, Mo., Aug. 22. Last week
J. D. Brightwell and two sons, Clar
ence and Hamilton, succeeded in kill
ing three wolves on the farm of Gus
Gilliam, northeast of Gilliam. Bright
well has two first-class hounds and
Gilliam informed him that the wolves
had been killing chickens, calves and
pigs on his and other's farms and ask
ed Brightwell to bring his dogs and
see if he could catch them.
Brightwell's son killed one of the
wolves, the dogs another and Bright
well one. They failed to catch the
mother and another pup, but probably
will give them another chase in the
near future.
