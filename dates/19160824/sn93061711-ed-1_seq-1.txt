QUAY COUNTY PRO
B 1 0 15 S HOLD
I
Tlie Prohibitionists of Quay County
hold their first County Convention lut
Saturday, which was well attended
considering the fact that the party is
jut organizing in the County. Seven
teen delegates look pail, only three
being present hy proxy, and delegati
came from various parts of the county.
The convention was called to order
hy Harry H. McKlroy. who was there
upon selected as temporary hnirman.
Upon accepting the temporary chair
manship. Mr. McKlroy ndd'osscd the
convention relative to his purposes in
becoming party prohibitionist. I'.o
stated that prohibition ropieschls to
him the greatest issue before the
American people, lie said he had in
the past supported men who were op
posed to prohibition and parties op
posed to this issue, but from this
l Imp. he would never again give his
vote to a party "or a candidate, regard
less of his party, who is opposed to
the prohibition of the liquor tralllc.
The chairman then announced that
it had always been the custom of the
Prohibition Party to open all its con
ventions with an invocation, ami called
upon Rev. Mnddox. who led the con
vention in an invocation which was
very impressive.
The convention then entered upon
its business, selecting John Whitmore
as chairman and Rev. N. J. Reasoner,
secretary.
The committees were appointed and
after their deliberations, the chairman
called upon Miss Sarah I). Ulmor of
Hudson. New Mexico, as a special
mark of appreciation of the giont
work being done hy the women of the
county for the Prohibition cause, to
read the National Platform of that
party. The reading of the platform
was perhaps the most intoiosting fea
ture of the convention. Both the plat
form and the reader were heartily
cheered. It has been generally con
ceded by the press that the platform
for lll is the greatest platform that
the party has ever writtun and that
its leaders this year are aiming the
great men of the Nation.
The platform declares for prohibi
tion of the mnnufm-luro, importation,
exportation, transportation and sale
of alcoholic liquors for beverage pur
poses; for woman suirragc; for a pol
icy of peace and friendliness with all
nations. It condemns the wasteful mil
itary program of the Democratic and
Republican parties, and .--ays: "We
will not allow the country to forget
that the first step toward phy.ical,
economic, moral and political prepar
edness is the enactment of National
Prohibition." The prohibitionists de
clare for a non-partisan tarifT com
mission, reciprocity, against the viola
tion of the sovereignty of .Mexico. The
platform says: "The Democratic party
lias blundered and four yearn ago the
Republican party e ailed and passed
on the problem it now asks the op
portunity to solve." It declares for
conservation of national resources,
appeal from departmental decisions
to the courts; uniform marriage and
divorce laws and the suppre do" -the
truffle in women anil girl ; one
term of six years; public ownership
of public utilities; social justice; in
itiative and referendum, and measures
for development of the agricultural
interests of the nation.
Hon. K. K. Winter addressed the
convention in a short but very earnest
and interesting talk.
The central committee was author
ized to make additional endorsements
or nomination's to lill the ticket, to
make endorsement" of state candidates
which the party in this county will
support.

to accept a nomination from more
than one party, we recommend that

Ira Lnndrith for vice president.
We heartily endorse the platform
adopted by the National Prohibition
Party.
We believe only in supporting ncn
for public oillce in the Nation, State,
and county, who are in favor of Pro
hibition; who are independent of the
liquor support for their election und
who are not under obligation to the
liquor forces; and who are capable
as well, by reason of their qualifica
tions, ot defeating opposing candi
dates standing for opposing principles
We do not believe in lending our sup
port to a candidate simply because he
is favorable to prohibition, unless he
has also the qualifications to make
him a good public servant, and to sue

HI6DAY TAKES SALLEY'S
PLAGE AS WHEAT BUYER
-IS PAYING 51.39 TODAY
The cement work for the new ele
vator and the new olllco and scales are
about completed. Mr. Higday will be
the buyer here in place of 1. R. Salley.
lie is one of our townsmen, having
come here from Liberal several months
ago. He will also run his oil husino.--iu
connection witli the buying of grain
and the farmers can rest assured of
fair treatment. He was paying SLflS
during the past few days and today
the wheat market took a very sudden
rise Thursday evening and Mr. Hig
hly is offering $I.Hl for I-riday de
livery. Seven loads have already been
contracted for and will be here Fri
day. There is no telling what Higday
would pay for wheat if he had the
elevator ready for business.
I. R. Salley went to Liberal Satur
day for a few days and perhaps will
omnia there. He is being relieved by
Mr. Higday. Mr. Salley is one of the
iiest wheat buyers in the west and
as there was not much coming to Tu-
iiumcari at present it was thought best
by himself to return to Kansas where
competition is brisk and his services
would be more valuable to the employ
ers.
NHW PICTURE SHOW WILL
OPHN IN TUCUMCARI SOON
Mr. Krnst. manager of the Masonic
Opera House, reports the fact that
his company is figuring on opening
picture show in that house about
the first of the month. It will operate
only three nights each week and noth
ing but special features will lie shown
from one of the foremost houses in
the distributing business. Tucumcarl
already his one of the best pietuio
shows in the west but it is thought
that two places would do a paying
business und make some money out
of their investment. They have re
cently made extensive repairs on the
opera house and expect to relit the
inside in good shape. This will do
away with the project of remodeling
same and turning it into a garage,
and will leave us a fit place to hold
political speakings this fall when the
caiffpaign really waims up.

Washington. D. ('., Aug. 'J.'J. The
railroad employes' committee showed
xucli marked signs of unrest today at
delay in the negotiations between
ilMin and the railway executive" that
the leaders ol the men were alarmed
and openly expressed fears of their in-
ability to hold them much longci.

that while the pressure for immediate

would be willing to give tho president
a little more time.

the white house last night. It is un

to secure Mr. Wilson's specific ideas
on how the railroad." are to reimburse
I their treasuries for the many mil
lions additional expenses which would
' arise out of acceding to the presidents
plan for an eigiit hour wage basis.
The big committee of brotherhood
representatives was impatient at the
delay but W. C.. Lee, head of the train-1
men's department, expressed the be
lief that they would not be held hero
past tomorrow.
The men felt that the railroads show
a disposition to disregard their sac
rifice of the demand for time and a
half overtime. The four brotherhoods
leaders decided not to issue a state-
meat, oxnoctoi! for nulilication until '
i !
It was understood definitely that the
railroad executives had decided to act
as a unit In handling the present sit
nation. The piogram of the railroad execu
tives us understood was to deal first
with the principle of arbitration and
afterward with the eight hour day.
RAD MKXlCANS II KIMS
Two Old Mexico mexicans were ar
icsted last Saturday at the stock pens
charged with threatening the life anil
property of one Teo Martinez, who
lives west of Ttictiinenri about four
miles. They were carrying a gun on
Martinez's place and threatened to
do many things. They said they were
looking for a comrade and wished to
cut fences that they could go where
they pleased.
Martinez objected and lifter pre
pared for any emergency that might
occur. He sent his family to one of
the neighbor's and succeeded in keep
ing the men oil" his place, but they
threatened him and ho came to town
and had them arrested.
They were tried before Judge Mc
Klroy and he bound them over to wait
the action of the grand jury.

THREE CHILDREN CAUGHT
BY WALL OF WATER DROWN,
HUSBAND RESCUED WIFE
Three Mexican children were drown
ed and the mother came near drown
ing in Ute cheek Sunday, when a big
wall of water evidently from a cloud
burst came suddenly down the creek
and washed h wagon in which they
were waiting for the husband and
father to assist the big Overland car
of A. Paul Siegel through the quick
sand.
Mr. Siegel was on his way to Santa
Fe to attend the suite republican con
vention when he drove into the Ute
creek and struck quick snnd. A na
the moxican, wife and three children
came along and stopped to pull the
car out. He took his team loose from
the wagon and left it with the folks
in the cieek lied which was dry. While
they wer' working with the car this
big wall of water came tearing down
the creek and before the children couh
be rescued thoy were washed into the
torrent and carried down the strenm
The father had a lasso rope and SUC'
ceeded in i oping the mother and pull
ed her ashore. Then he lossoed one
of the children anil succeeded in get
ting it near to the bank when the rope
slipped oir and the child wont out of
sight and never returned to the sur
face again.
Mr. Siegel's lug car is covered with
, "and and the front end is pointing
1 straight up ami the man who reported
his horrible tragedy says it will take
a hoisting derrick to pull it from its
eting place.
i I KY HAD PLACES IN ROADS
SHOULD RE FIXED UP NOW
I. K. McLaren was in from his farm
near Quay Wednesday. He brought
in one hundred choice cantaloupes and
I sold them to a local store at .V each.
He is aiiMoiis to have the road worked
I between here and his place and says
that three men could easily nut it in
i good shape if thoy would work a week
and do it while the ground is moist.
Strike while the iron is hot" is his
motto, and it is as good today as it
was thirty years ago. The road com
missioners should put forth an effort
' to make the roads passable for those
' who desire to haul loads to Tucumcari
i and other points in Quay county. If
, these roads can be fixed with a slight
cost there would be no trouble raising
it by popular subscription. Every .'i
1 toinobile owner could afford t pay
something und the farmers could give
a day or two in labor. If there was n
little more co-operation in the build
ing and caring for roads It would add
to the valuation of farm property and
be more economical to those who haul
large loads of grain to town.
Conflicting reports as to Villa have
been received. They say he's sure
enough dead. He was poisoned early
in June by u nurse and just now died.
He's got more lives than a cat.
1HE NEW MEXICO
OLD GUARD FORCES
ARE BADLY DIVIDED
Santa Fe, Aug. 2!L An unexpected
slip came in the plans of tho HubbelU
Hursum forces in the Republican state
convention, when a motion to njdouru,
offered immediately after the reading
and adoption of the platform, carried
by a vote of DM to I'M. Apparently
in complete; control of the convention,
the Hubbell-Iiursum men had planned
to nominate the senator, the governor
and the congressional candidate be
fore taking a recess until tomorrow
morning.
Alexander Read of Rio Arriba coun
ty, whose delegation favors the nomi
nation of T. H. Catron for senator and
W. G. Sargent for governor, moved to
adjourn until Thursday morning ul
nine o'clock.
The roll of counties was called and
the Huhhcll men were shaken when the
county showed three votes majority
for the motion. Permanent chairman
It. C. Hernandez declared the motion
carried, and the delegates began to dis
perse.
The resolutions adopted just prior
to adjournment declare for submission
of constitutional amendments for pro
hibition, for woman suffrage and for
an executive budget system.
Hubbell men assert that the ad
journment vote is not a fair showing
of their strength; that some counties
voted without understanding the mo
tion and that others were weary with
the long session and voted to recess
without realizing the significance of
their action.
Chairman Kly presided when tho
convention was called to order short
ly after 2:00 o'clock. He then handed
the gavel to Senator Fall when the
latter was conducted to the platform
amid a noisy demonstration. With the
remark that this was his last act in
connection with the party, he took his
hat and left the hall.
PROF. ELBA V. WISEMAN
WEDS A CALIFORNIA GIRL
Announcements were received in
this city recently containing the in
telligence of the marriage of Prof.
Wiseman, formerly of this city, and
a member ol the school faculty hero
last year. He wus united in marriage
to Miss Ressie Lucky of California,
in Albuquerque, Wednesday Aug. 1(5.
and the happy couple returned next
day to Santa Rosa, where they aro
now at home to friends.
Prof. Wiseman was n favorite hero
last year as he was the coach for the
basket ball teams and understood the
gume thoroughly. This year he will
be located in SanUi Rosa where he la

His friends here congratulate him up
on his now position and can highly
recommend Mr. Wisemnn to the cit
izens of Santa Rosa.
FHAR CAR SHORTAGE
Railroad ofllcials expect a car short
age this fall, if the strike does not.
take place, and already they are mnk
ing plans, on advice of the interstate
commerce commission and their opera
tings chiefs, to release cars as quick
ly as possildo after thoy vouch their
destination.
The railroads have all been placing
heavy orders for new cars during tho
present year, but they have boon un
able to keep up with the demand of
the shippeis. The condition is one
that reflects tho prosperity of tho
country at largo, but it is one that is
apt to cause a great deal of grievanco
to the railroads. To the general in
crease in business and the heavy move

The "dry" convention in Tucumcarl
Saturday was one of the most pleanlng
ecnts of the season, it brought ruin
during the session and it brought a
big rain that night. Evidently tho
elements were rejoicing over Hie way
the convention was conducted und tho
ticket selected. It will be seen in an
other article in this paper that tho
Prohibitionists nominated two candi
dates, endorsed two from the Demo
cratic party and the rest from the Re
publican party with the exception of
two places being left vacant. Mr.
McKlroy. one of the leaders in the new
movement says that he and his fol
lowers and associates believe in so-
'..!( Inir tlin lii-xt men for nfllcn rcimrd-

less of their politics. They want men
who are not bound to anything hut
right and justice. Mr. Winter, tho
nominee for sheriff says ho will en
force the law to tho best of his abil
ity and will see that the rlghtts of the
farmer and citizen are respected. Ho
will not attempt to close the saloons
so long as the state and county allow
and license them to run, but ho will
require then to abide by the law In
every particular.
A few speeches were made and tho
convention adjourned to meet some
time in the near future when tho va
cancies in the ticket will be filled and
probably a few of the endorsements,
changed.
