Bremen, August 24. The German
super-submersible Deutschland eluded
the. vigilance of at least eight British
warships and the whole American

2. Passing out of the capes the
Deutschland encountered a great num
ber of schooners which had dropped
nets ostensibly to fish. The real pur
pose, Captain Koenig said today, was
to make soundings for the Deutseh
hind, aiming to signal the allied war
ships when the submarine should
plunge through the nets. The war
ships made no attempt to approach
within the three milo limit. During
the whole of the journey of 4200 miles
the Peutsebiand ..submarined only ll'
miles. A heavy fog on the Knglish
coast delayed Hie submarine several
days. ' '

LAWYERS ADVISE
AGAINST APPEAL IN
LOCAL PAVING CASE
Attorneys in the case Involving the
validity of about $500 .000 paving bonds
in Chickashu advise that no appeal bo
taken from the statu supremo court
which decided the litigation adversely
to the citizens and it is assumed that
their counsel will be followed, thus
ending proceedings that have been go
ing on in the courts for three years or
more.
Alger Melton, of the law firm of
Bond, Melton & Melton, in announcing
the decision reached by the attorneys
for the plaintiffs, today gave tho Ex
press the following statement:
"After consultation with Judge O. B.
Stuart, It is thought advisable not to
appeal the paving case fo the supreme
court of tho Unitod States. The state
supremo court holds in the decision
that the action can not be maintained
to test the validity of the assessments
because not filed within 00 days after
the assessing ordinance was adopted,
and therefore, under the statute no
suit can bo maintained after fio days
from tho date of the assessing ordi
nance, when the purpose of the suit is
to question the validity of tho assess
ments. The court bases its opinion
upon the principles controlling legis
lative acts which have to do with the

BIG MONEY
IN HOGS
Farmers Take Advantage of Good
Prices These Days .
Why don't the farmers of Grady
county raise more hogs?
That is the question that is bother
ing some of the people who know hoi
much money can bo made out of It.
Yesterday afternoon several loads
of hogs were brought in by farmers
for shipment by A. S. White, local bog
buver. One of these men brought in1
three hogs averaging 231 pounds each,

CITY BUDGET
CUT TO TUNE
OF $6,700
No Chanre for New Reinforced Concrete
Bridge Across Line Creek
at Fourth
Tho hopes or Mayor Coffman and
Street Commissioner Dan Beets for
a reinforced concrete bridge across
Line Creek at Fourth street went
glimmering this morning when, at tho
conclusion of tho slashing process
which tho city budget for 1910-7 un
derwent, it was found that tho esti
mates passed by the city council had
been bled to the amount of $0700-. The
largo part of this was deducted from
the street and bridge fund and this
was almost wholly taken from funds
which were designed to meet tho most
of tho new bridge.
Other departments suffered but
slightly. Tho contingent supply fund
was reduced $1250, the fire depart
ment suffered to the tuno of $500 and
$200 was subtracted from the allow
ance of the library fund. Neither the
cemetery nor tho police fund was
touched, tho latter already being shy
tho payment for tho motorcycle cop.
"I regret this course became neces
sary," said Mayor Coffman this morn
ing, "as many people were anxious to
seo tho construction of this bridge,
which is badly needed. However, their
next best show to get It would bo to
float bonds for It."
Hie revised budget w ill be presented
to the county excise board for approv
al at 3 o'clock this afternoon, the com
mittee being Mayor Coffman, City
Treasurer Clark and City Attorney
Grlgsby.

or some othvr state one could inarrv
on tho day following the decree.
"Do yer reckon we could marrr
down there?" he asked, but being told
ho could not do so and return, to Ok

ho decided it would not pay.
"I kain't afford to run away because
I got too much property here and I
don't want, to go to tli.e pcu," he con
cluded. Yesterday, however, he encountered
fresh difficulties. ..
"We've been waiting for you sinew

tho licence.
"Sorry to put you out, boss, but I
had to work,"
"Would you lot common labor Inter

ed the deputy. Then Brother Wray.
who wan present, innocently asked
how much it cost to get a license.
"It costs $3.10," replied the officer.
"Ghee, that's a "lot of 'money," re
piled the pastor. "Where I lived onct
they only charged $1.50."
"Dat's all it cost me," interjected
the prospective bridegroom. "Ouca

When pressed for an explanation hi
admitted that he had been married
and unmarried four times.
"You must know a whole lot about
women," suggested the deputy clerk.
No. not so much." he, replied, "You
see I married two women twice. Di
is only the third woman."
"And will she also be a second term
or?" asked the pastor.
"No sah, no sah, you see do Bib!t
says you must only marry seven times
and 1 kain't afford to waste no more
time on do same woman."
Then came the moment of parting
with the coin.
"These are awful hard times to- b.
paying out so much money," put in
Brother Wray. Tim led to a disens-
sion of the -price of flour and meat
ami tho darkey held back his money
for a moment and scratched his head.
With this the deputy clerk softened.
"If you think this is too hard on you
I c an tear up th license," he said.
"No sah. no f j. : 1 dun sign mr

and he left the office wiih a les con
