ENGUSH HOUSES
HAVE ADJOURNED
Not to Meet Again Till Oc
tober 10—Unusual Wave
of Confidence.
London, Aug. 24.—Both houses of
parliament adjourned yesterday until
October 10, after adopting a bill ex
tending the present parliament an
other seven months.
Not since the outbreak of the war
has parliament adjourned on a situa
tion such as the present and what
was described by David Lloyd-George,
minister of war, and other ministers
In debates as giving so little cause for
anxiety or so hopeful an outlook for
the future. The debates reflected a
feeling of confidence, although ex
pressing realization that heavy tasks
are ahead and that there is no pros
pec) for hostilities coming to a speedy
end.
.It is the general belief that before
parliament reassembles' a further im
portant state df the entente allied of
fense will have been developed in the
nesir east which may have great in
fluence on the whole field of opera
tions.
There was considerable discussion
recently concerning food supplies
here, although high prloes are due to
scarcity, the costliness of freightage,
and as Captain E. G. Pretty man, par
liamentary secretary of the board of
trade, explained in the house of com
mons today, to abnormal consump
tion by the millions of men in the
field. Captain Prettyman said he esti
mated that these men each half as
much again as they did in civilian
life. While the question of food is
pressing heavily the government has
seen no reason to take any new steps
for administrative control of the mat
ter.
The cabinet ministers also express
ed great confidence in the constantly
growing economic pressure being ex
ercised against the central powers.
The difficult questions of suffrage
and registration reform have been
shelved temporarily, but in the house
of lords Inserted in the bill extending
the life of parliament an amendment
which the house of commons accept
ed, providing that any new parlla.
ment elected on the existing register
should endure only two years. This is
an emergency which is unlikely to
a'rlse, however. It seems almost cer
tain that the next parliament will be
elected on the basis of adult suffrage
with women voting, although there
are many opinions that the country
ought to be consulted on this import
ant question.
TWO ARE! KILLED.
New York. Aug. 24.—Two work
men were killed and a score severely
injured,' several probably fatally, yes
terday, as the result of the collapse
of a five-story brick tenement under
construction in the Bronx. Search of
the ruins for six workmen reported
missing, revealed no bodies.
NORTH DAKOTA'S
Industrial Preparedness to
Safeguard Country Against
Commercial Warefare Is Urged
Washington, Aug. 24.—Debate In
the senate on the emergency revenue
bill yesterday was featured by a long
speech by Senator Penrose, urging
Industrial preparedness to safeguard
the country against commercial war
fare at the close of the European war
and vigorously attacking the pending
measures. He questioned the legality
of the proposed munitions tax and
criticized the proposed Inheritance
tax and the general democratic/ad
vance toward substituting direct taxa
tion for the protective tariff.
Senator Underwood, democrat, au
thor of the present taMff law, and
Senator McLean, republican, also par
ticipated in the discussion, the former
defending the tariff law ,against re
publican attacks and the latter charg
ing the democratic administration
with extravagance and deploring Its
tendency to resort to sources for fed
eral taxation that should be reserved
to the states.
"This question of Industrial prepar
edness," said Senator Penrose, "has
received definite recognition in the
pending bill in the provision relative
to dyestuffs. This concession mfcde by
those who abhor Imports and duties
and tend to the thought that nearly
all of the expenses of the government
so far as possible should be raised by
taxes on Incomes and other direct
taxes, seems to me to constitute a
surrender which gives up their whole
case. If dyestuffe require a protective

REPUBLICANS
CONFIDENT
WBItRNSTATB
Expect Larger Majority for
Hughes and Fairbanks
Than Ever.
Chicago, Aug. 24.—Alvin T. Hert.
manager of the western republican
national campaign headquarters,' to
day issued a statement declaring that
preliminary reports from various seo
tions of the middle and far west are
most encouraging.
"The chairman of state central
committees advise us that in normally
republican states the republican ma
jority this year for Hughes and Fair
banks will be larger than ever," says
the statement.
Throughout the west, republicans
and progressives are working har
moniously, he declared.
W. C. Cook, republican national
committeeman from South Dakota, re
ported harmony among the different
factions of South Dakota, declaring
that Hughes is certain to keep South
Dakota in the republican column.
Injunction Against
Picketing Companies
St, Louis. Mo., Aug. 24.—An in
junction against the picketing of its
dairy establishments and against in
terference with its employes on the
part of striking milk wagon drivers
was sought in the circuit court ]her«
late yesterday by the Grpfeman Palry
Company, one of the "big four" of the
nine dairies affected by the strike and
lockout of union drivers.
The suit was directed against the
Milk Wagon Drivers union, the Inter
national Brotherhood of Teamsters
and eleven officers of unions involved
in the strike.
The petition says, that the strike
has damaged the dairy to the extent
of $10,000 and that trade has been
lost through the intimidation of cus
tomers.
CONVENTION ADJOURNS.
Jefferson City, Mo., Aug. 24.—The
republican state convention adjourned
yesterday afternoon after adopting a
platform vigorously denouncing the
democratic party for its administra
tion of state affairs, and declaring for
a protective tariff for a "dignified and
firm foreign policy and for the pro
tection of American lives and rights
in Mexico."
Washington, Aug, 24.—The defend
ing flfleet won. the first point in the
war game, when a fleet of "enemy"
transports was found.
The wireless at. Arlington ploked
up orders from Rear Admiral Helm's
disposing his line to meet the
"enemy."
No word came of the whereabouts
of the hostile battlefleet commanded
that the same argument can be ap
plied ail along the line."
Referring to recent conferences of
the nations at war regarding commer
cial plans that will operate to their
own benefit after the war, the Penn
sylvania .senator said
"In the face of these developments
already occurring and with the likeli
hood of still more portentlous aspects,
of trade war arising in the near fu
ture, we are called upon to pass the
pending revenue measure without any
regard whatever for the menacing
situation which will Inevitably con
front us as the war In Europe draws
to a close. The only recognition oc
curring in the bill of such a menace
is In the antl-dumplng paragraph.
Here, again, we have an act of in
consistency similar to that which we
find in the Instance of dyestuffs.
"We are drifting to a system of di
rect taxes at a time when nearly ev
ery civilised nation Is going In the
other direction. Before the outbreak
of the war in Europe every nation in
Europe, except England, had a pro
tective tariff. If Germany had not had
a protective tariff and been able to
meet a large.part of her requirements
from home protection, the war would
have been over long ago, as far as
Germany was concerned And there 1*
every reason to believe that with the
close of the war new trade alliances
and treaties will be made which make
It more imperative than ever that the
United States should get ready,-for in-

Plot Charge.
Chihuahua City, Mex., Aug. 34.—
Nine of the men suspected of con
nection with a legalists plot were ac
quitted by a courtmartial yesterday
after an exhaustive inquiry. They
had been arrested in Juares and sent
to Chihuahua for trial because of
their relations with Mariano Tames,
the- civilian volunteer leader at
Juarez who recently started off to join
Villa. Their defense was that they
had been misled by Tames into believ
ing they were going on a picnic party
and they had. not actually joined the
expedition.
The written declarations of Jose
Inez Salazar, a former Orozco gen
eral, and the twenty-two others held
.with him as suspects were turned
over to General .Trevino for review.
Proof against theni is said' to/ consist
mainly of newspaper clippings rela
tive to the doings of the legalists*
and other photographs of Oroico' and
Villa officers.
Among the suspects is Angel Ver

leader made a forced march out of

MICHIGAN A CLOSE
STATE IN CAMPAIGN
Chicago, Aug. 24.—Michigan is
classed as a close state in the present

man of the Michigan democratic state
committee who was a visitor at west

here yesterday.
"Michigan is prosperous," said Mr.
Stephenson. "The working people of
the state are well satisfied with con

II. S. PERIOD
OF GREAT TRADE
Business Activity Greatest
in History—Affect of
War Upon Trade.
Washington, Aug. 24.—How the war
has affected the world's business is
detailed in a statement compiled by
the department of commerce for
Chairman Simmons of the senate
finance committee. The following
general conclusions are given:
"Business activities were fairly nor
mal in the various countries of the
world during the two years preceding
the outbreak of the war.
"In every country.- including the
United States, there was" a decided
decline of business activity after. July,
1914.
"The period of business depression
following the outbreak jtf -the -war
lasted from four to six mollis in fnost
of the fieutral countries. In the
belligerent countries the upward trend
did not begin until the last few months
in 1915.
"There was a slight depression in
business activity in the United States
in the latter part of 1913 and early
in 1914, but in the spring and summer
of 1914 there were signs of recovery.
The outbreak of the war. however,
caused a decided decline.
"The United States at the close of
the period. April. 1916. had entered
upon a period of business activity
which has had no parallel In the his
tory of the country."
Complete figures could not be ob
tained from all countries, but the re

tistics and diagrams issued on the sub
ject under one cover since the war

system that the majority are now

much too large to be handled by one
man and the proper attention cannot
be given to the fields.
"In Illinois we look upon a 160 acre
tract as an unusually large farm,
while in this section few farms are
smaller. I believe that by splitting up
the farms and adopting diversification
methods, that greater results would
be attained and a more prosperous
