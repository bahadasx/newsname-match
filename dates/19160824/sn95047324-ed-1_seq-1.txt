HOW YOU MAY
BE COMFORTABLE
IN THE SUMMER
Heat of the Season Not Such a
Serious Matter in
Florida
CAUSES DEATH ELSEWHERE
In this State the Matter of Being
Comfortable is the Weightiest
Problem to be Considered in...so
Far as the... Weather Conditions
are of Concern
It's a problem not confined to
the people of Florida, for to the
citizens of the Peninsula' State,
the heat of the summer is not so
serious a matter as it is in that
tier of states just north of the al
most forgotten Mason and Dixon
Line. In those loss favored com
munities it sometimes becomes a
matter of life and death. In Flor
ida it is merely a question of in
convenience. During the present
season almost tvf o hundred deaths
were occasioned by high tempera
tures in one "hot spell" in Chica
go, more than have occurred from
the same cause in Florida, in
twenty or fifty years, probably
more than during the entire his
tory of the state.
And so in this far southern part
of the United States, the heat of
the summer months is not a thing
to be worried about, for it is not
dangerous to human life or health,
and the matter of being comfort
able is the weightiest problem to
bo considered in connection with
the weather.
The normal temperature of the
human body is 98.6 degreees, sum
mer and winter, and the work of
the body is to maintain this de
gree as closely as possible. The
natural variations from it are
slight and depend mainly upon in
dividual peculiarities, upon the
hour of day or night, the effects of
eating and drinking and a few
other more, or less indefinite
causes, but any marked variations
from it are likely to be followed
by serious results.
Personal comfort depends much-
upon the rapidity of evaporation
of natural moisture from the sur
face of the skin. Such evapora
tion is slow if the surrounding air
is charged with humidity.. If the
atmosphere is dry, perspiration is
absorbed more quickly from the
skin with a corresponding increase
(if comfort. The draft from a rap
idly moving electric fan is reviv
ing because it removes the surface
moisture, replacing it with drier
air, even though it does not reduce
the temperature of the atmos
phere. The matter of personal comfort,
therefore, depends largely upon
tlic kind and weight of clolhing
and whether -the inline has the
tendency to promote the proper
and normal evaporation of sur
face moisture, or to retard it. Ui
is essential that the clothing shall i
In- of such material as to permit
as nearly as possible such normal
evaporation, and this brings up
ihe question of clothing fabrics
best adapted to warm climates.
Cotton and linenare best be
cause the heat and moisture of the
body more easily pass through
them to the outer air, In colder
weather, because of this same de
!!(( of conductivity, they are poor
protection for they admit the cold
er air from the outside. These
fabrics lose absorbed moisture
quickly by evaporation: that is,
tin y dry quickly. Wool and silk
absorb moisture less quickly and
they give it off, or dry more slow
ly-
The conclusion follow s that cot
ton and linen are best adapted to
summer wear in southern climat
es, and that as few layers of these
materials as are necessary, should
1 worn, to secure the greatest de
cree of comfort through evapora
tion of the surface moisture of the
skin.
Summer diet the kind and
quantity of food and drink has
much, very much, to do with bod
ily comfort. Some foods are heat
producers, that is what they are
tor. You don't need as much heat
in summer as you do (or think you
do) in winter. Eat fruits and
vegetables in preference and dont
make experiments with your diet
in summer. If you want to take
chances, try it in colder weather
when the body is better able to
withstand shocks and surprises.
Remember that water cooled
with actual contact with ice is the
best summer (or winter) drink yet
discovered. Drink all of that you
want, especially between . meals.
Bathe often. Keep the body clean
and the mind clear. Keep your
hardest ' working for the cooler
months, see that your conscience is
in good working order and you
will find the Florida summer a
most delightful season and decid
edly preferred to that section
much further north. State Board

The census of 1910 shows that
of the citizens of Florida born in
Alabama there were 37,267. In
the last five years a good many
more Alabamians have no doubt
moved in. The total number in
1910 of people born in other states
living in Florida numbered 255,-
000 exclusive of 40,663 born in
foreign lands.Practically one third
of the people of the state are na
tives. Tallahassee Democrat.
Pan-American Union Represents an Ideal
of Political Kinship
By GEORGE HAVEN PUTNAM, Noted Publisher
The Supreme Court Decision
The esteemed Tampa Tribune
says that if there is to be a recount
at all, it should be a recount of
the entire state. We feel quite
sure ithat Mr. Knott and his
friends would be perfectly willing
to have the same done, but it was
never done in any of the previous
contests. ' So far as this paper is
concerned, it would like to have
the recount made be absolutely
impartial, non-partisan experts
wiv adding machines, which
would make a mistake almost im
possible. It would not defraud
Brother Catts out of a single vote
that is justly his for the nomina
tion. The Tribune again says : "The
supreme court decision sets a very
bad and dangerous precedent in
this state.'"
The supreme court is merely
following, not setting a precedent
a precedent that was made
when Bloxham contested the seat
of Day in 1870, now forty-six
years ago. A precedent that was
again followed in the case that
made Drew our Democratic gov
ernor in 1876, and in cases that
have come before the supreme
court several times since.
The Tribune will, we hope, par
don us for saying that it docs not
seem to be well posted . on our
supreme court decisions as in
some other matters. Ocala Banner.
TIIERE has been during all the half century of my experience as n
publisher a steadily increasing demand on the part of American
readers for what you call "serious and important" books.
The growing interest in South American affairs will stimulate the
6tudy of the Spanish language and the reading of Spanish literature.
Such must bo the natural result. As has been 6aid, political affiliations
bring about business connections, social relations and intermarriages. A'
better knowledge of the social conditions and methods of life and
thought stimulates naturally an interest in the literature which present
pictures of life and examples of thought.
THE BEAUTIFUL PALACE IN WASHINGTON, WHICH STANDS FOR
THE PAN-AMERICAN UNION, REPRESENTS AN IDEAL NOT ONLY
OF POLITICAL KINSHIP, BUT OF NEIGHBORLY AND MORAL OBLI
GATIONS. This union, framed as it has been for the defense of the continent
and for the prevention of war through the adjustment of the interstate
difficulties that have heretofore brought about war, MUST BRING
ALL THE FEOPLES OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE INTO
CLOSER SYMPATHETIC RELATIONS WITH EACH OTHER.
We have confidence that a result of such relations will be the wider
circulation throughout South America of books produced in the United
States and a more intelligent and general appreciation in the United
States of the growing literature of South Aincricr..

oil or a quart of melted lard might
also be given as a purgative.
There are thousands of acres of
low lands in South Florida that
now are not considered of any val
ue, that will make ideal pasture
for catttle and hogs with very lit
tle cost or work. These lands
could be fenced, drained, and set
to some improved grasses and us
ed to fatten hundreds of cows and
hogs at practically no cost. Live
stock raising is sure to be one of
the largest, if not the largest in
dustry in a very few years. There
is no industry that will make a
country rich quicker than stock
raising, and Florida owing to its
climate, is as well adapted to ani
mal husbandry as any state in the
Union. Every farmer should have
at least a small heard of hogs aud
cattle and the better the breed,
the more profit he will make.

The unbiased citizen will agree
with Mr. Knott when he says
"that mistakes were, made on the
first tabulation of votes in every
county of the State has now clear
'y been demonstrated.'" If the
inspectors were not famiPar with
the new law we must concede that
many or trie voters were equally
as ignorant. For instance, take
Franklin county where many of
the voters single shotted under
me Deuel that this was the only
safe way to have their votes count
ed for the men of their choice.
And were the inspectors anv bet
ter posted than the average voter
who wanted his ballot to count?
If Mr. Knott received a majority
of the votes cast, how in the name
of common decency can we refuse
to give him what belongs to him

It is about time to remember
about cooperation again. Cooper
ation can be worked 365 days out
of the year thruout a life time.
Some Florida farmers are cooper
ating, but the large majority are
not.
Florida shipped nearly fifty
thousand carloads of fruits and
vegetables during the season of
1915-16. Florida is some state
and is getting bigger and better
every day. Palatka Times-Herald.
"Why will folks persist in follow
ing the single cropping system?
A great deal has been said against
the practice in recent years and a
great deal more has been said
about the results which follow it.
It is at the root of most of the
farm and rural ills which exist
at present. A great many men
have worked for a solution of one
or more of the results, but Dr.
Bradford Knapp of the United
States Department of Agriculture
has submitted the formula which
gets at the bottom of the trouble.
P. II. Rolfs, dean at the Univer
sity of Florida College of Agri
culture, callsattention to Dr.
Knapp 's safe farming program.
This program has been publish
ed a great many times, but in view
of the fact that single cropping
still exists it is worth publishing
many times more:
"'1. A home garden for every
family on the farm. Not less
than a tenth of an acre for gar
den and half an acre for potatoes.
An acre of sorghum or cane for
the syrup of the family; the ex
cess cane can be fed.
"2. Produce corn enough to
feed the people and livestock on
the farm for a year with a little
excess for safety.
"3. ' Produce oats and other
small grain to supplement the
corn' as food and to conserve the
soil in winter.
''A. Produce hay and other
forage crops sufficient to feed the
livestock on the farm for one year,
not forgetting the legumes which
produce hay and enrich the soil.
'"5. Produce the meat for the
family by increased attention to
poultry and hogs. Plan to grad
ually increase and breed up the
cattle and oilier livestock so as to
consume the otherwise waste pro
ducts and make the waste land
productive. Not less than 25 hens
for a renter and 50 for a land own
tor. Set a standard of at least
one sow for every tenant family
and two for every owner, and
breed them carefully and feed
them well. Not less than two
milk cows for every family, the
cows properly bred and fed.
"6. When the living has been
provided, grow a money crop. If
this is done there will always be a
few eggs and chickens, a pig now.
and then, and occasionally a
steer for sale, and out of these
surplus or sundry products let us
pay the farm expenses."
This program will make for
safe farming. It will relieve the
necessity for borrowing money
and for "store credit." It will
enable farmers to bank money.
It will provide a better living and
conserve soil. It will make for a
more prosperous and contented
rural population.
Dean Rolfs suggests that every
farmer make preparations to fol
low the details of this plan. In
Florida where the planting sea
son lasts practically the year
round it can be adopted at any
season. The best season of course
is the earliest available, which is
now.
Grapes on Small Scale Profitable
in Florida
Enough men have failed at
bunch grape, growing in Florida
to give the impression' that these
grapes cannot be grown in the
state. A few men have found
them profitable and their success
shows that under proper care
grapes can ge grown profitably.
One man near Green Cove Springs
has three acres and he finds a
ready market for the prodct. Like
nil men who have succeeded, he
practices close pruning and cuts
back close to the stump each year.
It is generally supposed that
the heavier soils are best for
grapes. This man, according to
A. P. Spencer, district agent for
the University of Honda Exten
sion Division, has his on loose
whit." sand. The Niagra has been
most satisfactory to those who
have succeeded in growing
grapes.
While bunch grapes may not be
profitable on a large commercial
scale, they may pay when grown
for local sale. Certainly they
would be worth trial for home
use.
Did you ever try advertising
farm products in your local pa
per? N. M. Bceler, instructor in
agricultural journalism in the U-
nivcrsity of Florida College of
Agriculture, says that a good
market can be built by systematic
and consistent advertising.

Saving With Clean Hands
Punta Gorda Herald has two
articles running side by side, am
one of them reads "Clean Hands
and the other tells about "Saving
the Guava. " Does the connec
tion between these two essays in
dicate that one must have, clean
hands before saving those guavas
Or after? Can, by any stretch ol
culinary art, a guava be saved un
less the hands are cleaned? Would
there be a change in the aromatic
indescribability of the aforesaid
guava if it was saved before the
surplus dirt and foreign sub
stances were removed from the
hands or even feet? Explana
tions are in order. Query: Why
polish the paws between the sav
ing of one guava and the rescue of
his brother? Thorn, in Palm
Beach Post.
Cattle Die of Impaction
Young cattle are subject to im
paction of the third stomach dur
ing the early fall when the grass
becomes dry and woody. The
trouble may occur in mature an
imals but it is not likely. Accord
ing to C. L. Willoughby, professor
of animal husbandry in the Uni
versity of Florida College of Agri
culture, young animals eat more
greedily and their stomachs are
not developed to handle the ex
cess of dry food.
Impaction is caused by exces
sive eating when the grass has be
come woody and dry. The ani
mals do not usually drink water
enough even tho plenty is avail
able: The material packs into
the third stomach tighter and
tighter as the animal eats. Some
times it ferments and bloats the
animal.
Death usually comes in a few
days and sometimes no evidence
of previous sickness is noticed.
For this reason animals should be
watched closely and given a pur
gative. One of the best purga
tives is epsom salts and ginger.
Dissolve a pound or a pound and
a half of epsom salts in a gallon
of luke-warm water and add a
tablespoon of ground ginger.
Drench the animal with a quart of
this at intervals of ten or fifteen
There arc thousands of acres of
idle land in Florida acres which
are doing nothing to bring in
something to the owner, although
it must be admitted that the own
er and not the land, is to blame.
The cultivation of these lands,
with the proper attention to study
studying conditions and taking
advantage of soil and climate,
would result in many dollars be
ing in circulation that have not
yet been even introduced in Flori
da. Palatka Times-Herald.
The camphor tree grows on
most all Florida soils. There is in
this county one camphor farm
of over two thousand acres. The
fact that Japan and Formosa arc
now depended upon for camphor
and in view of its uses in tho man
ufacture of ammunition, and in
view of the lessons we are learning
from the European conflict, Flori
da should go into camphor farm
ing more extensively. Palatka

London, Eng. The offensive in
the Balkans is in full swing, with
Russian troops arriving in Salon
iki tojight with the allied force3
and Roumania reported about
ready to enter the war on the same
side.
Landing of Italian forces who
are also to take part in the Balkan
operations is continuing. An of
ficial dispatch reports that Greek
troops have been engaged with
Bulgarians in the vicinity of Seres.
Athens advices indicated that
Russian troops have been in the
Balkans for more than three
weeks, the initial contingent hav
ing arrived at Saloniki some time
previous to July 31, the news hav
ing just been released by the
British censorship.
The arrival of the Rusisans at
Saloniki, together with the report
that Italians had landed there, in
dicates that the allies intend to
concentrate sufficient forces for an
important campaign.
It is only 350 miles in an air line
from Russia to Greece, but Rou
mania and Bulgaria lie between
and to bridge the distance Rus
sians had to travel thousands of
miles . As the Bosphorus is clos
ed by the Turks they were depriv
ed of the short sea route.
Tho Russian troops sent to
France earlier in the war made a
journey of approximately 17,500
miles, traveling to Port Dalny,
Manchuria, overland, and thence
by water to the Suez canal and
the Mediterranean.
Since the White sea is now op
en, it is possible the Russians took
the Atlantic route by way of Gib
raltar and the Mediterranean.
Dispatches regarding opera
tions on the Macedonian front are
followed by numerous indications
that the battle is becoming gener
al along the 150 mile line. Immed
iately north of Saloniki in the Doi-
ran region, Serbian troops are re-
n-t d to have captured two forts
while in the heaviest fighting re
ported, on the left bank of the
Struma, Anglo-French forces arc
attacking the Bulgarians north
west of Seres.
On the western end of the line
the Bulgarians claim notable '
varices, some of which are conced
ed. They have pressed southwest
from Plonna. occupying Kastoria
and Koritza.
Operations on the western and
eastern fronts are overshadowed
by those in the Balkans. The en
tente offensive, however, is pro
ceeding uninterruptedly on both
these fronts. The French have re
sumed artillery activity on the
Somme capturing trenches near
I'iStrces and Soyecourt, south of
the river. They have also made
progress north of the stream in
the outskirts of Clery, an objec
tive in their drive for Peronne.
The British on the Somme front
are gradually creeping nearer
hiepval, their latest advance
bringing them within 1,000 yards
of the place. They also report a
considerable gain near Pozieres,
where they have pushed forward
along a half mile front. Guille
mont, northwest of Combics, is
still holding out, although the
British are fast hemming it in and
artillery fire continues heavy.
Petrograd reports the situation
still unchanged in Galicia, but
claims the gain of further ground
from the Turks in southern Turkish-Armenia,
west of Lake Van.
In Persia the Russians who have
been driven back a considerable
distance in recent operations ap- .
pear to be making a stand.
