OPEN MONDAY,
Sept. 4th, Very Urge Enroll
ment Expected; Teachen. of
Agricutuie For High School
The time has come again to
announce the opening of our
Schools. The first Monday in
September, the 4th, is the day.
lAc opening exercises as usual
vfill be in the School Auditorium
at nine o'clock on the morning
of that day. Again we extend
to the patrons of thf Schools and
to all others interested in its
welfare a mcst cordial and ur
- gent invitation to be present at
, the exercise. The presence of
: g large number of interested and
enthusiastic patrons and visitors
on opening day is always a source
of great encouragement to pupils
ard teachers and is a great help
to successful work for the en
tire year. The people of Marion
hayi a!
; hif ly
wr"5 ish
han always . repond;d 'very
to these invitation! arid
sh they might understand
how much their respors' con
tribute to the excellence of their
Schools.
The announcement of the oren
irgcf the session of' llC-fui"L
should be grfftfd with keener
. in'ittft snd expectation than
lormt rones. At the beginning
of last session we stattd that
the time was ripe for a new de-
velopment and a forward Ftep isijoll-P.ankin. Jake Msyes.'tim the deported persons were

was so large" that our quarters

new hi'h school builiirg ard in
thiU lection of a additional teach
er. Our building proposition is
only begun, We must, think
toKtlher, stand together and
work together unceasingly, un
tirirgly, intelligently, unselfishly
and public-spiritedl) fcr the sat
isfactory and successful comple
tion of the project which means
. so much for better schools in
Marion and Crittenden county.
Our beys and girla deserve the
best; let us see to it that they
get it.
The additional teacher will en
able us to make the High School
better meet the needs of our
town and county. We have al
, wa believed that better and
more scientific methods of farm
ing would aid very much the
development of the industrial,
financial and commercial interests
of the town and county, and
have wisheJ that the High School
might conttibute more to this
end. But heretofore the High
School has been unable to do
t his on account of a lack of equip
lent and teachers. Now with
jur i.Sp ond co-operation we
"laU jjiible to offer two or three
V courses in Agriculture.
t hope every graduate of the
51 men schools of the county
'1 read this and make renewed
, irts to attend High School this
iion.These young people a
r years hence will beprogrei-
citizens of this county.
7 should be makirg prepara-
tion for greater ue fullness. Mr,
Jas. Homer Moore who last
spring graduated at the Univer
sity of Kentucky in the four year
Agriculture course of that insti
tution will teach the courses in
Agriculture. He is well equipped
for such work.
Are not these considerations
enough to justify the statement
that we should look forward to
the work of this session with
keener interest and expectation?
Let us boost our Schools and
make them the best in our ses
tion of the state.
We wish to urge every parent
and guardian to see to it that
their children start on the first
day and that they atttend regu
larly. Progress in school work
is impossible without regular at
tendance. Please remember the day, the
hour and the place, and be pres
ent to help us start the best
school session in Marion's history.

Plans Made For The Ceremony at

N. J. Sept. 2.
Washington, Aug. 23. -Senator
Ollie M. James, permanent
chairman of the democratic na
tional convention, who will make
the speech at Shadow Lawn,
Long Branch, N. J on Sept. 2,
notifjing the President of his
nomination, yeste.day issued a
call to members of the notifica
tion committee to meet him at
the Hotel Knickerbocker, New
York, at 8 o, clock in the morn
ing of that day. The committee
will depart for the. President's
summer home in a special car
attached to the regular train
leaving New York at 10 a. m.
Thrpp y o-79 later the President
will give r lunchec n to the com-
m..:ee r.t udo;v Lawn a-.d the
r.otif.cut'on ceremony will take
P'nce at 4 c. m. Sjr.a'or Jamts
;jut :he f.aishing touches on his
notification speech yesterday. It
is about 1,000 vord3 long and
these who have read it say it is
'a masterpiece."
The President's speech of ac
ceptance is said to be within
4,000 words.
The understanding here is that
President Wilson and Mrs. Wil
son will leave Washington for
the summer capital a few days
before the notification exercises
are held. On the morning of
Sept 3. the day following the
notifint'o?, President Wilson
will Kave Long Branch for
Hodgenville. where on Labor
Day he will deliver the address
at the Lincoln Memorial farm.
His private car will be attached
to the special train that will
leave there at 10 a. m., on that
date for Kentucky. It is not
certain at this time that Mrs.
Wilson will accompany the Pres
ident to Hodgenville. Following
tbe notification at Shadow Lawn,
Senator James will go directly to
Maine, where he will spend the
closing week of the campaign
delivering speeches.
