FORMER CALLS FOR
INDUSTRIAL ACTION
Protective Tariff Is Urged
by Speakers; Under

WASHINGTON, Aug. 23. Debate
in the senate on the emergency
revenue bill today was featured by a
long speech by Senator Penrose urg
ing preparedness to safeguard the
country againsf commercial warfare
at the clos of the Kuropcan war, and
vigorously attacking Hie pending
measure. He questioned the leualiiy
of the proposed munitions tax and
criticized the proposed inheritance
tax and the general I e niocrntic ad
vance toward substituting direct tax
ation for tho protective tariff.
Si nator I ndervvood, lieoiocrat,
author of the present tariff law, and
Si nator McLean, Kepuniican, also
participated in the discussion, the for
mer defending tho tariff law and the
later charging the licuiocralic admin
istration with extravagance and de
ploring Its tendency to resort to
sources for federal taxation that
should be reserved to the states.
"This question of industrial pre-
parcuness, sunt .senator I'epr.ise.

pendence. 1 conclude that the same
argument can bo applied all along the
line.''
Ileferiing to recent conference of
the nations at war regarding com
mercial plans that will operate to
their own benefit after the war. tho
Pennsylvania senator said:
"In the lace of these dev elopinents
already occurring and with tliu like
lihood of still more portentious aspects
of trade war arising In tho near fu
ture, we are called upon to pass the
pending revenue measure without any
regard whatever for the menacing
situation which will inevitably con
front us as the war in Kurope draws
to a close. The only recognition oc
curring in the bill of such a menace
is found in the anti-d imping para
graph. Here again we have an act
of inconsistency similar to that which
we find In the Instance of dyestutls.
An; Hriliing Now.
"We are drifting to a system of di
rect tuxes at a tunc when nearly every
civilized nation is going in the other
direction."
"It a munitions tax Is to be im
posed," Senator Penrose declared, "it
should be applied lo all w ho sell con
traband goods to nations at war."
He said that the munitions tax Is
a section un-uniform, of doubtful va
lidity, of questionable legality and ob
jectionable in many other ways.
'it might also be argued that such
a tax would affect our neutrality," he
said.
"A neutral government docs not
protect trade in contraband. If it
tried to turn it into a source of rev
enue it would lav Itself open to a
charge of such interest in the busi
ness as to make it virtual partner."
Senator liiderwood spoke at length
in defense of the existing tariff law.
He approved the pending revenue
bill In its main features, he said, but
did not concur in the recommenda
tion lor a tariff commission and in
creased duties on dyestuffs. After re
viewing the operations of the tariff
law and submitting a multitude of
statistics. Senator liiderwood said he
hail "conclusively demonstrated that
tariff taxes now on tho statute books
do not jeopardize American industry
or threaten American labor."
The law, he declared, was written
to provide revenue and "in repudia
tion of the Republican doctrine, which
levied luxes primarily for the purpose
of maintaining protective tariffs to
foster and build up special industries."
The revenue bill. Senator Cnder
wood said, was necessitated by the
demands of the wealth of the country
for military preparedness and "it is
but Just that they should pay for
that protection."

Stores Dest roved.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 23. Tin- navy
depart incut was taxing its resources
totiieht to fill up the first hypotheti
cal Lcip in the country's defense which
bus developed ill the naval war game
in progress oil' the Atlantic coast.
Theoretically a mob of un-iinl-fi.
lined men today overpowered the
naval guard at the piers of Sew. ill
Point on Hampton Itoads, destroyed
great stoics of coal and supplies col
lected there for possible use of Hie
"blue" di fending army, and burned
tlie piers.
To add to tlie realism of the game.
Hear Admiral lienson, chief of opera
tions, formally communicated the
hypothetical disaster at Sevvall Point
to Paymaster-General McGowan,
whose duty it would be In war to
cope" with the situation there. The
paymaster-general immediately set
his forces to work to locate new stores
of coal and supplies and to lind lagans
for sending them to some point on
the Koads at the earliest possible mo
ment. The problem requires that ac
tual supplies be found ami the possi
bility of getting them forward prompt
ly be figured out.
While naval forces ashore were
dealing with this angle of the game
Hear Admiral Helm still was sweep
ing the seas with his scouts In a south
easterly direction from Narragansett,
the base from which he sailed yes
terday morning in nn effort to repel
Admiral Mayo'a "red" fleet. Presum
ably the "blue" scouts were within
three hundred miles of the enemy's
In-st known position at daylight, but
no teport that "red" battlecraft had
been sighted reached the department
up to a late hour. Officers here say
Admiral Mayo probably has changed
his course and is endeavoring to slip
around the end of tho six hundred
niile line of scouts with his Hi battle
ships and thirty transports. If he can
reach a point between Cape Hatt"ras
and Kastport. Maine, without having
been sighted ho will be able to em
ploy his fleet to hold off the "blue"
squadrons while a landing is effected.
