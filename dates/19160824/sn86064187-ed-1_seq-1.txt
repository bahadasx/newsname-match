WASHINGTON. Aug 24 -The

found by the defending fleet and
the first point in the big naval war
game goes to the dcul'eiiding tones.

being sent from , Kear Admiral
Helm's flagship, arranging his line.
No word has come of the where-ahoiits-
of the hostile fleet com
manded by Admital Mayo, but it is
supposed to be near the transports.
I he navy department had a spy
siaic today It was entirely theoret
ical, however, and was based on the
(ear (hat information regarding the
dilation of Admiral Helm's "bie"
fleet guarding the Atlantic criasl
against a tactical assault hy Ad

Danish Parliament
Refuses U. S. Offer
to Buy West Indies
LONDON, Aug. 24 The Danish landtthing hat re
jexted the proposal to sell the Danish West Indies to the
United States, says a Reuter dispatch from Copenhagen.
The vote was taken in committee by the landsthing,
the upper house of the Danish parliament. The treaty was
rejected by thirty-nine votes.
Although the lower house of the Danish parliament
approved the project for sale of the islands to the United
States for $25,000,000, the action of the landsthing in re
jecting was expected generally in Denmark. The vote,
however, does not necessarily mean the final defeat of the
project, as other questions of a political nature are in
volved. Negotiations for the formation of a coalition cabi
net failed yesterday and general elections are to be held,
after which the treaty with the United States will be
brought up again.

miles on her homeward voyage At the beginning thr sea was tempestuous, hut i
later it hrcamr more calm. 1 he Deutschland proved to be able to navigate the !
stormy Mages excellently Mrr engines worked Uultlrssly. No icebergs were
passed on' thr joumry. -
The American government, says the dispatch, acted in a correct and neutral
manner, rigorously enforcing respect for its frontier from Rritish and French
warships by employment of us own men-of-war. After a British cruiser entered
Chesapeake bay at night even more effective measures were taken to enforce
neutrality.

W'AMIINliroN. Aug 24 - Aftrf
continued "inferences today between
President Wilson and thr select com
mitter of railtoad executives thr situ
ation '.iirrniinding thr threatened strike
was described as having narrowed
down to thr following;-
The railroad presidents, at least
the select committee of eight, are
willing to accept the eight hour
ilav. iivJ.sted on by President Wil
son affl the trainmen.
In return thry ask that they be
assuied as fully as possible that
all proper support hr, gtvrn and
mrans lie used to assure thrtn a
frrigbt rate increase from the in
terstate commerce commission.
They ask also that congress cre
ate a permanent board or commis
sion, similar to the Canadian com
mission, to handle future labor dif.
ficulties. A commission of this
character would he empowered lo
investigate when labor troubles
threaten and no strike could be
rallrd or strike voir taken pending
its investigation, a lull report of
which would he made public at its
conclusion.
At the end of the investigation
arbitration would be suggested,
but if not accepted opportunity
would be given to the men to take
a strike vote. The balloting would
be secret.
Favored By Men.
These proposals were communicateif
today by Commissioner Chambers of"2
the federal hoard of mediation to the
representatives of the men who ap
parently regarded them favorably.
Judge Chambers then reported to Pres
ident Wilson and a siib-committee of
railroad executives was summoned to
the W hite House.
None of them would say afterward
whether President Wilson rrported the
nirn would accept the proposal hut it
was said that some encouragement
was fell as a result of the negotia
tions. Approved By Wilson.
President Wilson is understood 'cj
feel some sympathy for the counter
demands of the railroads and not
averse to having the men accept them.
It is expected, however, that a vote
of thr (40 labor rcprrsrntatives here
must be taken before thev caii receive
the necessary indorsement.
In the meantime the executives will
continue their conferences amonf
themselves and another White House
visit may be made jater.
