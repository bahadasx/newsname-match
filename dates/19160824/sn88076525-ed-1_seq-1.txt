'Twin Boys of Mr.-and Mrs. Jasper
French Burned to Death in
an Old Granary.
A deplorable accident happened at
Osnabrock last Saturday afternoon,
shortly after one o'clock, when .Ches
ter and Ernest, the five year old
twin sons of Mr. and Mrs. Jasper
French, residing on the old Thorsten
«abe farm, five miles south of Osna
brock, were burned to death in nn
(jfld granary that was located a short
distance from the residence.
Shortly .after dinner the, little folks
riaecured
some matches and went out
to the granary, which was used dur
•ing the past winter for some of the
"^Uve stock. There was ho ceiling in
f^Che building, and to make it warm a
.ffew planks had been thrown across
-'the joist and a load of straw put in
above them. The boys climbed up on
:to this straw and set it on fire, and
^before their father and mother, who
-vrere only a short distance away,
could reach them, the straw, which
%as very dry, was a mass of flames,
Mr. French made a frantic effort
to reach the children through the
^nall opening in the upper part of
the building, but was driven back by
-the flames, and the parents were
Compelled to stand by until the flames
burned through the straw, and the re
mains of their little ones fell to the
-floor below. Here they were recover
-ed by the father, who sprang into the
burning mass of straw and timbers.
Neighbors rushed to the scene from
all directions, but everything had hap
pened in so short a space, of time
that the only assistance they could
•give was to comfort the mother, who
has been in a most precarious condi
tion for several days following the
accident.
Chester and Ernest were born on
-vflitf 3lBt of December- ajid the-lst .of
Jfcnuary,' and Would hav£ been six
ye^rs of age had they lived until the
'Coming New Years. They were the
youngest of a family of six boys and
two girls. Their parents lived until
Map on the James Griffith fartn
southwest of Osnabrock, when thev
xemoved to their present home direct
ly south of Osnabrock.
The funeral services were conduct
ed by Rev. Arthun at the Dovre
church near Osnabrock on Sunday af
ternoon, and was largely attended by
sympathizing neighbors a"
who, with the bereaved parents, can
scarcely realize how suddenly death
«ame into this happy home.

feated the motion to take up the
measure, and returned to considera

Five Torn About
On the President's word that he
would veto the bill, five revolting
Democrats turned about and voted
•against the motion to take it up.
They are Senators Beckham, Cham
berlain, Culbertson, Lane and Over
man. They made the vote 32 to 28.
Senators Ashurst, Hard wick, Myers
and Smith of South Carolina and
Vardaman, all Democrats however,
.sttiek to their votes to take it up.

The shrill fire whistle sounded
about one o'clock Sunday morning,
and consequently the entire city was
arroused from their slumbers, ani
many were on the scene immediately
to find the frame structure on Fourth
street and owned by A J. Stade, and
occupied by Mrs. Btond&k as a millin
ery store was a mass of flames. This
is the store commonly kuown as the
LeMay-Wagness millinery store. 'n.
fire department worked hard to c( n
fine the flames to this structure, and
were successful, but when the fire wan
extinguished the building was an
empty shell, burned and charred be
yond repair. The stock was a total
loss, and practically nothing remained
in the building bi&tite stove. Mrs
Mondak had ju^t gwten in her fall
stock of millinery,' and the loss falls
very heavy on her. The stock was
valued at $1800, ]mitial£jr.covered by
insurance. Bow the fire irfarted is a
mystery as the building was all in
flames before it was discovered. Ow
ing to some smouldering timbers a
secone fire alarm was sounded and
this was the cause of arousing many
for the second time.

SWIFT & CO. GUILTY OF CHARG
ING FOR MEAT CONTAINERS
AT SAME BATE AS FOR PRO­
DUCT THEREIN.
Yonkers, N. Y., A«g. 232.—A fine
of $100 imposed today on Swift &
Company, meat packers, by City
Ctprt Judge Joseph H. Beall, carried
with it a decision which will cost Mie
country's meat packers $1,000,()00 a
year if approved by the higher cour*
according to their attorneys. It will
save this sum to the consumers.
Charged For Containers.
Judge Beall found the packers
guilty of having violated the law by
charging for meat containers at the
same rate as for the meat they Con
tained.
It was charged the company sob?
ham weighing 11 pounds 6 ounces ir
containers weighing 6 ounces and
charged for 11 pounds, 12 ounces of
Put Burden On Buyer.

Chicago, Aug. 22.—Hogs sold for
$11.30 per hundred pouttds at the Un

price in the history df the market
since the Civil war. Dealers predict
$12 by December.
A further advance in the price of
beans is predicted. A year ago beans
cost the housewife 5 cents a pound,
the retail price now is 11 cents. A
demand for beans for the European
army and for the United States troops
along the border is said to be the prin
cipal cause of the advance in price.
At East St. Louis, Pittsburgh, and
Indianapolis yards hogs also sold at
$11.80, highest record price for those

Frank Payne, a young lad about 14
years old, came into the city from
near Doyon, the latter part of the
week, as he had a slight sun-stroke,
and for a time he thought he was
about to die, and accordingly went to
Chief Timboe and made a confession
that he was wanted in Pbrtland, Ore
gon for house breaking. Instead of
dying he got better and Mr. Timboe
wired the police department of Port
land and received a reply that the of
ficers of that city held a warrant for
Payne for burglary and asked that
the officers hold young Payne and also
to hold any jewelry he might have on
his person. He had no jewelry as he
had sold it, but he is now held in the
county jail here awaiting the Port
land officers to take him back to face
the charge. While only a boy of 14
he has already served a term in a re
form school.

it turned just enough to go down a

on its nose, breaking the front wheels,

The gun was fully loaded and actual-

that he was a

the sheriff of the county and was
awaiting a sentence, as he pleaded
guilty to carrying concealed weapons,
but before the court sentenced him it
was thought best to look him up a
little. So our local sheriff and states
attorney questioned him closely and
learned where he had been working
in Wyoming and Montana, and thev
wrote the officers there and gave a
description of him, and immediately
they got word from the sheriff H:
Gillette, Wyoming, that he was the
man wanted there for horse stealing
blackmail and other charges and ask
ed that he be held. This week Sher
iff Thomas Tait, of Gillette, arrived
in the city and took his man back
with him, where he faces some ser

his actions gave him away and tho
officers felt sure that he must be
wanted somewhere and it took only a
short time to find out that he is a bad
man, and much wanted in Wyomin".

line, as he has been able to prove on
numerous occasions when some of the
other agents have questioned the
veracity of his statement. His word
should be taken as authoritative, as
he has investigated the subject pretty
thoroughly, and, from the number of
people and vehicles on the streets,
nearly every day, and at all hours of
the day, it would seem that his as
sertion does not hit wide of the mark.
The bank deposits show that Ed
more, and the farming community
surrounding it, is the wealthiest in
this section of the state. One of the
bankers is authority for the stateme.x

banks aggregate four hundred thou
sand dollars. This in a town of, per
