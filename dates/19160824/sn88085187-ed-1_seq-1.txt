I With part of llio council's evidence al
ready submitted, and the remainder known
to be of the same character, some Tacomana
are wondering what good will he atvoiii
'• pli.shed by tlie impeachment trial of Com
inissioiitT James ('. Drake, now in progress.
The latest evidence has been of such ■ pet
ty nature that it is generally conceded an
impeachment would not stick.
BUT A (.HEAT DEAL OK (1001) HAS
ALREADY BEEN AC( 'QM PLIBH ED. And
the future effects of the hearing will he felt
for years to come.
Politicians and public officials have l.een
brought face to face with the fact that their
administrations are subject to a public
probe if they do not give the taxpayers ev
erything that they have to give.
So far as Drake is concerned, several ben
pficial effects have already been registered.
A superintendent at the city's $3,000,
--000 power plant, notable as an incompe
tent, has been forced to resign. Drake
is laying the blame for many mistakes
and much of his department's misman
agement at this man's door.
The superintendent of the city's elec
tric system has quit his job at the very
beginning of the hearing, and is now
shouldering practically all the blame
for those things which the council
charges were negligently or inefficient
ly done during Drake's administration,
Although Drake will undoubtedly be able
to "slide out from under," by throwing all
blame for his administration's failure upon
these two men, the hearing will engender
greater efficiency in the conduct of Taco
ma \s valuable light and water departments,
because the commissioner now realizes that
the taxpayers demand service and compe
tence.
And another big point—
This entire hearing, accomplishing
much for the present and for posterity,
will not cost the people more than $100.
Drake may not be ousted, but enough good
has already been done to justify the im
peachment proceedings.
HIT OFF TIE BIT
Sen. Miles Poindexter, talking
straight from the shoulder —talk-
ing facts, not fancy, talking as
friend to friend-held two big
audiences spellbound In his meet
ings in Tacoma yesterdiy.
Poindexter, his six-foot frame
as straight as an arrow, entirely
at his ease, is an imposing figure
'>*the platform. When he lands
ar*point he lands It with all the
force of his tireless vigor.
Here are some of the points he
sent homo at the big meeting In
Eagles' hall last night:
• • *
The Issues before this na
tion today are the same aa
those which divided Athens
and Rome and every other
great nation. They are the
Issues of social dynamics, as
opposed to social statics—the
effort to advance and better
conditions, as opposed to
those who look backward
over their shoulders and nre
opposed to change.
• • •
The primaries have become of
high importance in our govern
ment. In former years voters
have allowed organizations and
machines to nominate the tickets.
The voters now serve a higher
function of citizenship. They
have taken a voice in nom
inating their own party candi
dates.
• • •
I'm strong for the women.
I am Independent by nature-
I love freedom and liberty—
and w.mien are independent.
You can't control them In
politics any more than you
can in your home- They're
death on bosses.
• • •
So there Is harmony between
the principles for which I stand
and the principle of universal suf
frage for women.
The suffrage amendment
to tho constitution was Intro
duced by a democrat. Wheth
er it. was introduced by a
ileini i rst or republican made
no difference- I voted for it

HARMONY'
HIS PLEA
I'm under a vigorous
t'l'iiNv-riiiiiiiiiuthni by Mayor
Fawcett at Thursday morn
ing's M"siun of the Drake
impeachment hourlng, Flei"
tric Supt. II W. « c.|lui>,
who resigned his position
the day liefnre the hearing
started', admitted that he
had never been held in Com
missioner Drake's confi
dence.
"1 was not afraid of losing my
job, but I wanted to maintain
harmony in the department, so I
did not tell everything 1 knew,"
he testified.
"Isn't It true that I reported
several times to you about con
ditions at the Nisqually power
plant, and about other rottenness
In the department?" demanded
Fawcett. _ «
"Yes, you reported them to me.
The same reports were made to
Mr. Drake, but he had the con
fidence of Mr. Holmes (former
superintendent at La Grande)
and of other heads of depart
ments. Anyhow, it was none of
my affair."
"Didn't you tell me that
you did not dare to be ween
talking with me or with oth
er commissioners, because
Drake would cut off your
head If he knew you were
telling us anything?" asked
Fawcett.
"I told you that it would not
be wise for me to be seen talk
ing with you, Mayor," replied
Collins. "Drake did not have
much confidence in me and I did
not want him to know that 1 was
going to you. I was not afraid
of my head.
"Wanted Harmony."
"All I wanted was harmony."
"Huh!" said Fawcett. "When
things are running rotten, you
don't expect much harmony, any
way, do you?"
Outside of his one admission
that Drake had been cognizant of
conditions in his department and
had taken no action to relieve
them, Collins continued Thurs
day to shoulder practically all re
sponsibility for discrepancies and
irregularities in the light depart
ment.
Collins' service with the city
expires a week from tomorrow.
Admits Charges.
On cross-examination Thurs
day morning Collins admitted
that Commercial Agent Rhodes
was using a cityowned car for
private purposes. He also ad
mitted that lie had received sev
eral reports that Rhodes was
drinking to excess, but explained
that he did not have direct super
vision over tlie commercial agent.
Collins admitted that he had
remonstrated with Drake on nu
merous occasions over the large
number of men carried on the
light department payroll. Drake
told him, he testified, that these
men were given work because of
the "hard times," and that it was
better to have the city pay them
a salary than to allow them to
become objects of charity.
Examined by Attorney Sulli
van, representing Commissioner
Drake, Collins declared that his
One of the highest
privileges of this in
stitution is to encour

and to assist them in

Why Does a Girl
Shut Her Eyes As
Man Kisses Her?
BY CYNTHIA GREY
Sometimes I think all of tlie questions which could have been
put Up to me have been asked, only to find a new one awaiting
nic in the morning mail.
Several dayi ago 1 opened a letter addressed in perfectly
neat, sensible handwriting and it contained this question;
Why does a girl Close her ryes when a man kisses her?
Ii was signed I_. C. M.
1 was on ihe verge of consigning the efforts of "1.. C. M."
to the waste paper basket with the rest of the foolish questions,
when I caught myself wondering if a girl really does ckne her
eyes when being caressed on the lips by her sweetheart
If so, there must he a reason —and I didn't know that reason.
IT'S ONI'. ON Till' BOSS.
I Have always admired the wisdom of our managing editor,
Ileis a married man. too. Surely he might lo know. So I
steatlthily crossed to his desk and put the question to him. Ho
was plainly fluslrated.
"Why ST —ant, does ■ girl always dose her eyes?" He
went on to state something about a psychological fact ami other
high-brow expressions that didn't mean anything in my life, but
Couldn't give me a definite reason.
hi despair I went to the pretty little- girl in our business of
fice across the hall; but alas—she couldn't even tell me if a girl
does close her eyes when a boy kisses her, let alone "why."
Cub Nays They Don't.
.lust then our handsome young
"culi" reporter came in. I nailed
him.
"Why, from my personal ex
perience, girls don't close their
eyes when a boy kisses them,''
he volunteered.
Ah, here was some one who
knew.
"Hut why do some of '.hem do
It?" I insisted.
"It probably depends upon
whether the fellow who does the
kissing is good looking," he said,
without even a blush.
This foolish-serious question
finally reached the ears of our
sporting editor, who, by the way,
Is of an artistic temperament He
informed me that all of the Illus
trations by Gibson, Christy and
Hrinkley picture a woman being
kissed with her eyes closed, and
suggested that I consult an ar
tist.
Acting upon this happy sug
gestion, 1 went upstairs to the
