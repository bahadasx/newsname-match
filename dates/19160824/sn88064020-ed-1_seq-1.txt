river is at a low 4ta;e and thi-re are
grea:t ,tiw'sit-ý of sand along the bat
ture. many of our residients are" aail
,ing themsele- cf tho prr:s le'. of
hauling sand to till up their lots. bu,
there are ornly a few places along our!
levee where it is easy of access.
While river sand may be had any
where along t he lIatture from tnt
Canal street terry up to the Br.ewer).
it is almost impossible to ct over the
levee except near IDiana street and for
the parties living in the lower section
of Algiers this extra long haul from
that saction of town means as addi
tional expense of about ten or fltreen
cents per load. Near the Canal street
ferry there is an enormous area of sand
deposits, which our citizens could
handle with much ease and at a muoh
less expense, but cannot reach the
sand on account of ostructions being
placed at his batture by the Southern
Improvement and Ferry Company,
which have lumber piles all over the
only avenue that is open to this bat
ture.
We do not lwlieve that the South
ern Improvement and Ferry Company
has the exclusive right to the sand
on the battture, the wagon road
should be left open so that our people
may haul this sand to fill up their
lots. The Herald has taken up the
matter with lion. Peter Vezien of the
Orleans Levee Board, who says he will
take up this matter at the next meet
ing of the board. This is a very im- -
portant matter for the Algiers people.
especially our bnilders, and Mr.
Vezien's efforts along this line to have
this batture way open will be greatly
appreciated by his many friends.
