HIGHER PRINTING
PRICES JUSTIFIED
Says That Buyers of Printing
Should All Realize This fact,
and Many of Them Doubtless
Do.
In defense of the increased
, cost of printing, G. Frederick
Kalhoff, in an address before
the Associated Advertising
Clubs of the World at Philadel
phia, said: f
"Printers, as a whole, do not
now charge and, in fact, never (
have charged anywhere near the
prices which, in proportion, are 1
charged by other manufacturing
industries. This is due, in a
measure, to the fact that every
job is in a class by itself. It is
like nothing else, and conse
quently it is almost an impossibi
lity to standardize prices.
"The printing business as a
manufacturing proposition, be
cause o f the infinite detail i
surrounding almost every separ- j
ate job, requires the closest
attention and an unusual degree
of . business ability to conduct
successfully year in and year out.
In common with other lines of
endeavor it has its fluctuations,
but from the standpoint of the
financier the printing business
has never been looked upon as
offering La promising field for
financial exploitation. This in
itself gives ample evidence that
this line of manufacture as a
mercantile proposition is one of
close margin of profit with little
.opportunity for more than
normal earning.
"Therefore buyers of printing
should realize this fact in a
larger measure than they appar
antly do at the present time.
Bearing that fact in mind, let
your mind be open to your print
er when he, after months of
sweating with the constantly
increasing cost of production,
endeavors to explain to you why
he is compelled to charge you
more than he did last year for
that repeat order.
"To the credit of the printing
craft, with allowances for the
shortcomings of a few individual
members, which in common
with those in other industries
are the exceptions which prove
the rule, it may be truly said
that printers are, as a whole,
industrious a n d painstaking,
endeavoring and a large measure
succeeding in the conduct and
operation of a nerve racking,
time killing line of manufactur
ing with dignity, honesty and
efficiency."
Notice to the Public
I am no longer connected with
the Richmond Cotton Oil Co.,
but will have charge of the gin
formerly run by J. S. W. Haw
kins. The Hiawatha Mfg. Co.
' has flitted this gin up with the
famous Huller Brest gins and it
is in fine shape in every particu
lar to do satisfactory work." : .
I wish , to thank those who
have given me their business
in the past and' shall appreciate
at least a part of your business
at my new stand. To those who
have patronized this gin in- the
past, we invite you back, assur
ing you your business will be ap-
1 predated. To any one else hav
ing cotton to gin, we wish to say
give us a trial and we will give
you satisfaction.
Respectfully yours,
J. H. Terry, Local Mgr.,

To the Christian People of
Okolona
In justice to the work of the
Y. M. C. A., the secretary of
the Tupelo Association wishes to
take this means of stating that
the dance held in the Okolona
Opera House immediatily follow
ing the performance of the Y.
M. C. A. Minstrel Show last
Monday night was held in spite
of the vigorous remonstrances of
both the writer and George
Parchman. The hiss of the
serpent was very evident when
an explanation was attempted.
The Y. M. C. A. stands for
every sort of wholesome amuse
ment, but the modern (?) dance
is so , destructive of character
and morals that it is not count
enanced at any Association
entertainment Please do not
confuse the Y. M. C. A. with
the dance.
. Sincerely yours,
, Robert E. Mell
General Secretary.

Clerk of Circuit
Court Speaks Out
Hon. T. W. Brand, of Decatur,
Gives Tanlac His Endorsement
"I've Actually Gained Six
Pounds On It," He Says.
Hon. T. W. Brand, of Decatur,
Miss., Clerk of the Circuit Court
and one of the most popular as
well as one of the most promi
nent men in the state, is another
one of those leaders of thought
and action who feels it his duty
to come forward and tell his
fellow citizens what Tanlac has
done for him.
"I recommend Tanlac," said
Mr. Brand in presence of G. E.
Thrash, Herbert Logan and J.
K. Barber, of Decatur, "because
I begin to feel better as soon as
I had commenced taking it.
"I am now on my fourth bottle
and besides relieving me and
making me feel very much bet
ter every way it has actually
made me gain six pounds.
"For a long time," he contin
ued, "I had suffered with swoll
en stomach and nervousness. I
had gotten so I couldn't sleep at
all well at night and my appe
tite was very poor.
"With the very first bottle of
this medicine I obtained a great
deal of relief, and 1 don't hesi
tate to recommend Tanlac for
trouble such as mine."
When this important case was
reported to Mr. G. F. Willis,
Southern Distributor of Tanlac,
at his Atlanta office, he said:
"Endorsements like this leave
nothing further to be done in
establishihg the merits of this
great medicine; for the best
evidence of a medicine's merit
is what people who have taken
it have to say about it, and
especially is this true when these
statements are made by men of
high character whom the people
have honored with public offiice.
"Hundreds of such endorse
ments, however, have come
unsolicited to T a n 1 a c, and
among the most prominent
names on Tanlac's roll of honor
I distinctly recall those of Judge
McKenzie Moss, of Kentucky;
Col. C. C. Gewin, U. S. Marshal,
Sheriff Mangum, of Atlanta;
Hon. Frank V. Evans, former
Mayor of Birmingham; Dr. J.
T. Edwards, Fayetteville, a. ;
H. W. Hill, Bank President,
South Pittsburg, Tenn.; and
others. The list is a long one
and the names are too numerous
to mention."
Tanlac is sold in Okolona ex
clusively by W. E. BEARDEN,
and in Houlka exclusively by J.
W. HOWARD & SON.

Experiments by the Japanese gov
