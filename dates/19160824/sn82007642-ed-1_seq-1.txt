Wilson and the Women.
' The members of the Jane Jef
ferson Club of Denver, the pio
neer organization of women vo
ters of the United States, ought
to feel flattered with the atten
tion President Wilson has be
stowed upon them. He not only
wrote them one of his lengthiest
State documents, but he caused
it to be delivered to them in per
son, having delegated Assistant
Attorney General Thompson, in
Colorado in the interests of the
President's campaign, for that
purpose, In the course of his
letter President Wilson elabora
ted his ideas on suffrage. He
told the Jane Jefferson club-wo
men that one of the strongest
forces behind the equal suffrage
sentiment of the country is the
now demonstrated fact that in
the suffrage states women inter
est themselves in public questions
study them thoroughly, form
their opinions and divide as men
do concerning them. It must in
'frankness be admitted that there
are two sides to almost every
important public question, and
even the best informed persons
are bound to differ in judgment,
it is not only natural, but right
and patriotic that the success of
opposing convictions should be
sought through political align
ment and the measuring of their
strength at the polls through
political agencies. Men do this
y naturally, and so do women
though it has required their prac
tical demonstration of it to con
vince those who doubted this.
In proportion as the political de
velopment of women continues
along this line the cause of equal
suffrage will be promoted. Those
who believe in equal suffrage are
, divided into those who believe
' 'iliaf oanh ctrttn 1 1. M -1 1 , I ninn!nn
for itself when and in what direc
tion the suffrage and those who
believe that it should be immedi
ately extended by the action of
the National Government by
means of an amendment to the
Federal Constitution. But
"Both the great political par
ties of the Nation have in their
recent platforms favored the ex
tension of the suffrage to women
through State action, and I do
not see how their candidates can
consistently disregard these of
ficial decta rations. I shall en
deavor to make the declaration
of my own party in this matter
effectual by every influence that
I can properly and legitimately
exercise."
There is no playing politics in
that attitude of the President.
The women who admire candor
and fairness will be inclined to
line up on his side. He further
tells them that woman's part in
the progress of the race "is quite
as important as man's. The old
notion, too, that suffrage and
service goes hand in hand is a
sound one and women may well
appeal to it, though it has long
been invoked against them." A
gainst these sentiments of a
statesman, Hughes would tickle
the vanity of the women and put
y ' their amendment safely in cold
;, .; storage. Charlotte Observer.

The Joy of Living.
"Life is just a disappointment
said a woman who had really a
great deal to make for happiness
"Then you do not live right,"
answered her friend, a woman
who had borne much, even dis
grace, for one she loved, with for
titude.
"Do you mean to tell me that
every one can be really happy?"
asked the woman.
"Iam," answered the friend,
"And I have taught my children
to be."
"Teach me, too, if you can."
"My dear, you have to learn to
enjoy every little bit and just one
bit at a time, to hen you awaken
be glad to get up and and that
you need not be chained to a bed
ofsicknessor pain. Enjoy pre-
paring the breakfast; it is really
the finest meal of the day if you
take it happily. Watch the out-of-doors
and see its beauties
the majestic storm, the caressing
sunshine and the singing 'birds,
the glorious sunset. If vou chan
ced to be traveling in a foreign
country, you might see these
same things and call them won
derful. Enjoy each piece of work
as it comes. Nothing is really
bad to do if we think right about
it. Some of it is a little strene
ous; but think of the beautv of
lines of gleaming clothes, of rows
of smoothly ironed garments, of
glistening windows and dishes,
of well-made beds and well-dus-
ted furniture. Once there seem
ed no happiness in the world for
me, but I determined to get hap
piness out of mere living. I made
my bed with exquisite care, so I
loved to get in it at night. I set
my tables as if for a guest, and
learned to enjoy my simple food.
1 liked my new clothes, however
simple they were, and my house
hold furnishings, however inex
pensive. I enjoyed my neighbors
and my own family. I enioved
every book and magazine as if it
were the only one I possessed. I
enjoyed my simple recreations
as if they were rarely unusual.
What gratifies me most is that
the children have fallen into the
same habit. 'Nice bed,' baby
says, and pats her pillow. Then
she nestles down contentedly and
drops off to sleep. It is not a
disappointment for her to go to
bed. 'liet's have a picnic, moth
er,' Robert is very apt to say.
Then we pack a basket of plain.

and cook our simple meal. We
jet close to nature, and I never

When Ihey'n Mustered Out.
There will be gains for the
young militiamen for whom the
bugle has sounded; gains that in
many cases will far more than
offset their losses. Suddenly they
have learned that there is a big
ger boss in these States than
Business obligations which all
the ordinary obligations salute
and give way to Sudddenly they

their time and strength and skill

been the effort of their young
manhood to satisfy. Suddenly af-
ter being hard fastened to a task
for years, they find themselves
shifted from their vocations to
what has been their avocation.
and with nothing to do but be a
soldier.
It is an immene change; a snap
ping of all the little chains that
restricted life; a change of thou't
duties, associations and physical
and mental habits; a chance to
develop in new ways; a general
revaluation of men and things.
All men will nob profit by it e
qually, and some will be hurt by
it. But to very many it will be
stimulating and developing, lea
ving them better citizens and
broader and more valuable men
than it found them. They will
have opened a great window of
life and looked out and that is
worth while. From Life.
Governor anil Flood Sufferers.
Winston-Salem Journal.
That was a fine message which
the Governor carried to the peo
ple of flood-swept Wilkes, a mes
sage such as they needed, of
brotherhood and encouragement
and hope. When a people have
gone down into the depths, have
faced despair, grim and black,
the knowledge that the State is
with them and will nelp them is
the knowledge that will save.
The people oi Wilkes have had
their immediate material necessi
ties supplied and now they are
begiuning to to take stock, and
a sad task it is. In one night al
most all their public highways
were destroyed, their bridges
wrecked, much of their splendid
arm lands ruined and many of
their homes were swept away.
The State awoke one morning to
see in the papers a story of de
vastation that was unbelievable
and subsequent investigations
roved what the newspapers had
was not half. And now it is over
and the people of those districts
are grimly facing the future.
They know the State sent them
food and clothing, but rerhnps
they had not thought until the
Governor came that the great
lieart of the State was yearning
over them, that the aid was as
rom one brother to another. It
was an incidental thing. The
great work is yet to come and
they know that the State is with
them.
Courage was what the Govern
or told them. "Stick to Wilkes,"
these were his words. The great
heart of the west is a determined
one, and that message which the
Governor carried will help them
stick.
The fight is for Wilkes and all
the counties which now have the
task of rebuilding. It is a task
that calls for the greatest hsro-
ism, the long, steady, hard grind
of years of untiring efforts. But
they will win. Already they have
taken stock and are considering
a bond issue for the reconstruc
tion of their road system. Such
a spirit admits of no defeat.
And the heart o a great State
is with them in the fight and with
the pride as of one brother for
another, will rejoice over their
accomplishments. ,
Judge Hushes vs. President Wilson.
Lexington Dispatch.
Judge Charles E. Hughes' ad
dress accepting the nomination
of the Republican party for Pres
dent was a great disappointment
to the country at larg, as. it was
devoted largely to a criticism of
President Wilson's policy to
wards Germany and Mexico. It
would be inferred from his speech
that if he had been President he
would not only have gone to war
with Germany, but would have
intervened and gone to war with
Mexico. He doesn't say that he
would have gone to war, but
that is the only sjde of the ques
tion he can take and criticise the
democratic adminfstration. Pres
ident Wilson is opposed to war,
and has used his wise diplomacy
in dealing with Germany, and
has made the Kaiser come to the
terms of the United States and
stop his murderous submarine
warfare, and has kept the peace
between one hundred million peo
ple in America and the German
government.
Mexico ihas been a source of
trouble for years and years. They
were murdering Presidents and
fighting during the Tafb admin
istration. So this Mexican troub
le was inherited from a republi
can administration. President
Taft refused to intervene and go
to war, because he was a peace
loving citizen. The trouble in
Mexico has not been settled, but
we have been kept out of war.
The National Guard has been
niobelized on the Mexican bor
der, and old Carranza appears
to be coming to his senses, and
the prospects look good for a
peaceful settlement of our Mexi
can trouble. The only thing that
President Wilson has not done
that he should have done was to
intervene and go to war with
Mexico, which would have meant
the death of hundreds and thou
sands of Uncle Sam's soldier
boys, carrying gloom and sad
ness into as many American
homes. The course pursued by
President Wilson may not suit
Judge Hughes and other Repub
lican politicians, but it is satis
factory to the great majority of
the mothers, wives, sisters, sweet
hearts and fathers of this coun
try, who love these soldier boys,
who desire peace and happiness
more than they do a be whisker-
ed republican judge made Presi
dent of tne United States.
President Wilson has kept this
country at peace with all the
world. We are enjoying the most
prosperous times in the history
of the country, and there is not
a single excuse for the average
who loves pence nnd prosperity
to defeat President Wilson, the
greatest man who has been Pres
ident since the foundation of this
government, to elect a man wno
is untried and who is criticising
the president because he has kept
the country out of war. We are
confident that the sober-minded
citizenship of the nation will re
elect President Wilson November
7th by the largest popular vote
ever received by any President
since George Washington.

Julius C. Chappell.
The subject of this sketch was
born in Wilkes countv, N.C. July
19, 1844, died April 22, 1916 in
the 72 year of his age. He mov
ed to Watauga county and set'
tied on Banner Elk in 1872.
He with his wife who has gone
on before went into the organi.
zation of Beech Mt. (now Mt,
Calvary church) in 187G where
he lived a consistent consecrated
Christian life till the day of his
death. He was not only the lea
ding deacon of the - church, who
by his wise leadership brought
inspiration to the membership
in the support of the church in
all of its work; he was the mov
ing spirit in the community in
which ho lived in every good
cause. Ho was indeed the leader
of a noble people who felt honor
ed and safe in his hands. It was
natural when difficult questions
would arise in the churehorcom
m unity for every one to turn to
him. Notwithstanding his lim
ited education, he was a man of
natural ability and possessed of
good business capacity.
As to books there was but one
with him, the Bible; his every day
companion. The Bible and Bib
lical Recorder held the place of
honor in his heart and lite.
While he respected others for
their honest convictions he had
no compromise for any doctrine
that could not be sustained by
the Bible. There was possibly
no more liberal man to his abil
ity than Brother Chappell.
No pastor ever turned away
from that church for other fields
of labor without feeling that he
had left behind a friend and sup
porter in the person of our dear
brother. He was indeed the
preachers friend.
To know brother Chappell was
to love and honor him for the
exercise of his honest convictions
in what he believed to be right.
To write the history of the com
munity in which he lived would
be to point out the life work of
J. C. Chappell.
It was in 1890 that the writer
became associated with brother
Chappell ns pastor of his church
and which continued for a num
ber of years, during which time
I learned of his firmness and
faithfulness to the truth and the
steadfastness of his friendship.
He knew no way to betray a
friend or turn away from him in
the day of adversity.
But his life work is done. He
has gone home. He has laid
down his weapons of war. He is
in the presence of the King. He
is resting. He is happy blessed
forever more. It is all over now,
it is finished. Home atlast. That
blessed "Welcome thou good and
faithful servant" will be his when
he stands in the presence of the
King and enters upon the full
ness of that eternal joy.
He now sleeps beside his wife
near the church that he so much
loved until Jesus comes again.
Well may it bo said of him,
"Blessed are the dead which die
in the Lord from hencrforth, yea
saith the Spirit that they may
rest from their labours, and their
works do follow them."
