'S WIFE
SILENT AS TO VISIT
OF IKJE GRAY
Mrs. Edna Cox Says She Has
Been Forbidden by Lawyer
to Discuss Her Suit.
HUSBAND BACK AT WORK
Mrs. Edna Cox, who has Instituted
suit against Miss Edith DeGray for
150.000 for alleged alienation of her
motorman husband's affections, when
seen at her home at 60S East Capitol
street today, refused to say anything
concerning the situation.
"I havo been told by my attorneys to
keep quiet," said Mrs. Cox, "and I in
tend to do so."
When asked if Miss DeGray visited
her yesterday at her home she admit
ted that It was true, but refused to tell
the purpose or result of the call.
"Old Miss DeGray attempt to make a
settlement with you to drop tho case?"
Mrs. Cox was asked. Mrs. Cox hesi
tated a moment and then -smilingly
shook her head.
"I have been forbidden to say any
thing. I have put the matter In charge
of my attorneys, and I don't Intend to
mako any statements until the case
comes Into court," she said.
Reiterates Statement.
Miss Edith DeGray today reiterated
her statement that she didn't know
Cox was married.
"I never gave him my right name,
ither." she said. "I gave him an as
sumed name, and until he saw tho
number of the license tag on my auto
mobile he called me by the flctlous
name' that I had .given him. After he
saw tho license tag he followed It up
and got my light name."
Although admitting she paid a visit
to the home of Mrs. Cox yesterday
evening, she would not state the pur
pose of her call.
"But the Idea of my wanting to make
a settlement with her to drop the case
Is foolish," she stated.
Although street car employes who
knew him expected him to "lay off a
day" as the result of his unexpected
and unsought for popularity. Levi Cox,
the man In the case, reported on time
at Thirteenth and D streets northwest
yesterday afternoon and took charge
of his car as usual.
When asked to make a statement con
cerning the Interview with Miss De
Gray, published In yesterday's Times,
Cox said:
"I will neither confirm nor deny the
statement. In fact, this noterlety has
gone too far. I have nothing to say
about tho case."
"Good Looking Chap."
Cox Is a heavily built man of about
thirty-five. He has very ruddy cheeks
and black hair, streaked with gray. Ac
cording to a description given a Times
reporter before Cox was himself seen,
no la a vcj nvwu v...p, w.,.
Although refusing to make any state
ment concerning directly the case. Cox
Intimated that there would be severnl
things brought out In the suit which
would tend to clear both himself and
Miss DeGray of the charges.
Soveral times while reading the
statement of Miss DeGray he seemed
on tho point of speaking, but with a
visible effort controlled himself, say
ing that ho would neither confirm nor
deny the statements made.
ENEMY HAS YET

war game that slipped by the censors
today. No Important Information was
obtained from any of the intercepted
enemy radiograms picked up by the
defending fleet on the Atlantic coast
and by shore stations.
Two more theoretical problems were
sent by the Navy Department to shoro
stations last night. One was that the
department had received reliable In
formation that an attempt would be
made to blow up magaslnes along the
coast. The other was that an attempt
would be mnde to fire the naval oil
tanks at Narragansett Bay. Tho com

GREAT CROWDS CHEER HIM
Submarine Freighter Submerg
ed for Only 110 Miles Dur
ing Whole Journey.
By CARL W. ACKERMAN.
BERLIN, Aug. S4. The German com
merce submarine Deutschland eluded
at least eight English warships and
a whole fleet of American fishing
schooners, in the employ of the allies.
when she dashed out to sea from the
Virginia capes on the night of August
2, It was learned here today.
Oreat crowds greeted Captain Koe
nlg and his crew when the first sub
mersible to cross the Atlantic returned
to her home port at Bremen last
night.
Captain Koenlg had no fear of the
allied warship patrol when he steamed
southward from Baltimore, but he had
not counted on the American schoon
ers hired to help trap hla vessel.
Passing out of the capes the
Deutschland encountered a great num
ber of these schooners, lying outside
Chesapeake Bay. The schooners had
dropped their nets, ostensibly to fish.
Tried to Catch U-boat.
Their real purpose, Captain Koenlg
aid, was to make soundings for the
Deutschland. aiming to signal allied
warship ir the submarine plunged
through their nets.
Koenlg telegraphed the Ocean Com
pany, owners of his vessel, that the
American Government observed corsect
neutrality throughout tha Deutsch
land's stay. ,
Both the British and French warships
respected American rights and made no
attempt to approach within the three
mile zone In their efforts to trap the
submarine. How many French war
ships were engaged In the patrol he
did not know.
During the whole journey of 4,300
miles, the Deutschland was nubmerg

The weather was splendid at the be
ginning of her voyage, but became
stormy later.

BAYONNE, N. J., Aug. S4.-Domlnlck
Proulson, one of the friskiest amateur
sharks In the waters about New Jer
soy, was arrested when he pinched the
four logs of what proved to be two com
plainants. Miss Sophie Price and Miss Clemlncnn
Turrlck were the persons whose
screams attracted a policeman passing
the city baths here.
According to the young women, Proul
son swam noar where they were wad
ing In Newark Bay and asked If they
cared to learn how to swim.
They made it clear that, however
they might yearn for aquatic skill, they
never would trouble him for a momont.
They requested that he pursuo himself
around the bay.
A few moments later Miss Price
sorcamed.for help and announced that
a shark was biting her. Miss Turrlck
started to run toward shore and was
rather gently bitten also.

RAILWAY WAGE
FIGHT AGAIN
Presidents Fail to Agree on
Final Answer to Wilson's
Proposals.
HOPE NOT YET ABANDONED
Burlington Head Says He Is Dt
termined Not to Give Up Ef
forts for Peaoe.
Failure on the part of the
mittee of railroad residents to
agree on a final answer to the pro
posals of President Wilson caud
the negotiation for a settlement f
the railroad controversy to reach
another deadlock today.
At the same time hope for aa
agreement has not been aban
doned.
While it was stated by President
Holden, of the Burlington, after a
conference with the President, that
the outlook was not any more
hopeful than heretofore, it it felt
in other quarters in equally close
touch with negotiations, that each
day makes the outlook for an open
break more remote.
SEE PRESIDENT.
The steeling committee of the railroad
executives, consisting of Mr. HolAss);
Daniel Wlllard, president of the Balti
more and Ohio, and R. F. Xovett, ckalr- '
man of the board of the Union PMtfc,
saw the President shortly aftar'aooa
today. '."
They left tho White Houi vr In" a mora
or less noncommlt! frame of mint.
On the one hand they discouraged tha
Idea of any definite conoluskm keiog
reached today, but Mr. Holden addad:
"I am determined not to gtra up
until every effort to reach a MtUesMat
has been exhausted. This U a big prob
lem which we are called upon to sflr.
and Involves a number of collateral
matters that call for painstaking
study."
Mr. Holden Indicated that the Presi
dent was showing no disposition t'
force precipitate action on the rail
road heads and appeared willing that
they should take all reasonable time
to make up their minds.
Ho sent for them today. It was ex
plained, to clear up certain matters
under discussion, and for the pur
pose of acquainting them with what
he Is doing at his end to pave the
way for an understanding.
President Wilson's course In "strik
ing down the principle of an Impartial
hearing" threatens a greater perma
nent Injury than that resulting from
"multiform and conflicting" freight
regulations. Walker D. Hlnes, chair
man of the Santa Fe executive com
mittee, said In a statement today.
Hlnes declared tho President, vrtthotrt
any hearing, decided it would be Juet
for the railroads to pay 150,000.000 more
a year to trainmen by establishing tbe
proposed eight-hour day.
Striking Feature.
One of the striking features or the
case, he said, is that the President'
course establishes or goes far to estab
lish the proposition that labor may com
bine to stop Interstate commerce un
less every demand is granted, and that
In such cases the President's proper
course Is to "make up his own mind
without a hearing as to tho concessions
he will force the employers to yield te
buy off labor from Its Illegal course."
Judge William l. Chambers, acting
chairman of the Federal board of media
tion and conciliation, was called to tha
White House this morning by the Presi
dent. Following the conference Judge
Chambers went to the National Hotel to
talk with the brotherhood heads.
Judce Chambers returned to the Whtte
House and strain conferred with thn
leaders of the men at the National
Hotel at 10 o'clock. Then he went to
the Willard Hotel to meet the railroad
executives and managers.
Judge Chambers brought a message
from the President to the railroad mali
ngers and brotherhoods. All sides re
fused to discuss the new angles of the
situation presented by the President.
After conferring with Judge Cham,
bors. Prcsldrnts Oarretaon. Stone. Car
ter and I.ee. of tho four brotherhoods,
hurried to the BIJou Theater, where the
640 railroad brotherhood chairmen were
meeting.
Judge Chambers said lie came to eee
the representatives of both sides to save
them from going to tho White House.
He Indicated that the brotherhood re
resentatlves mav bo summoned to the
White Houso by the President later In
the day.
Still Oppose PJan.
Today found the railway presidents
and managers apparently still deter
minedly opposed to granting an eight
hour day with ten-hour pay, but will'
Ing to meet President Wilson more than
halfway tf he can help them arrange
an eight-hour day on the basis of eight
hours' pay.
They will concede, the railway presi
dents say:
An eight-hour day for eight hours'
pay, at present rates.
Overtime at present rates, or arbltra
tlon of the overtime question.
They say they will not oonctde an
eight-hour day for which they must pay
the same wage they now pay for a ten
hour day. It would mean an Increase
of 21 per cent In wages to the brothr
