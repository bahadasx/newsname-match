Mayo's "Red" Battle Fleet—Has a
Good Chance to Land a Force and
Hold Off the "Blue" Fleet.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 23.—The navy
department wan taxing its resources
tonight to fill up the first hypotheti
cal gap in the country's defense which
has progressed in the naval war game
in progress off the Atlantic coast.
Theoretically a mob of un-uniformed
men today overpowered the naval
guard at the piers at Seawall point,
on Hampton roads, destroyed the
stores of coal and supplies collected
there for possible use by the "blue"
defending the fleet and burned the
piers.
To add to the realism of the game
Hear Admiral Benson, chief of opera
tions, formally communicated the hy
pothetlcal disaster at Seawall point to
Paymaster General McGowan, whose
duty it would be in war to cope with
the situation. The paymaster general
immediately set his forces to work to
locate new stores of coal and supplies
and to find means of sending them
to some point on the roads at the
earliest possible moment. The prob
lem requires that actual supplies be
found and the possibility of getting
them forward promptly be figured out
in order to test the machinery of the
department.
While naval forces ashore wore
dealing with this angle of the game,
Hear Admiral Helm still was sweep
ing the seas with his scouts in a
southeasterly direction from Narra
gansett, the base from which he sailed
yesterday morning, in an effort to re
pel Admiral Mayo's "red" fleet. Pre
sumably the "blue" scouts were with
in thirty miles of the enemy's last
known position at daylight but no
report that "red" battle craft had been
sighted reached the department at a
late hour.
Officers here said Admiral Mayo
probably had changed his course and
is endeavoring to "slip around the
end of the 600-mile line of scouts with
liis fifteen battleships and thirty trans
ports. If he can reach a point be
tween Cape Hatteras and Eastport.
Me., without having been sighted he
will be able to employ his fleet to
hold off the "blue" squadrons while
a landing is being effected.

JUDGE WORD'S
HERE
IN IMPORTANT CASE OF DENGLE
BROS. AGAINST THE BANK OF
FERGUS COUNTY.
THERE WAS NO FRAUD WHATEVER
The findings of fact, conclusions of
law, judgment and decree entered by
Judge R. Lee Word of Helena, in the
case of Dengle Brothers against the
Bank of Fergus County and others
have been filed in the district court
here. The trial of this important
action began before Judge Word here
on February 2S, John A. Coleman, It.
J. Anderson, L. P. Donovan, of Butte,
and William Scallon, of Helena, rep
resenting tlie plaintiffs, and H. G. Mc
Intire of Helena and Belden & de Kalb
the defendants.
In the complaint it was alleged that
mortgages and other secureties ob
tained by the bank from the defen
dant were secured through fraud, im
positions, misrepresentation, duress,
etc. The bank, by way of cross-com
plaint, set out the indebtedness of the
plaintiffs to it, introducing the evi
dences of such debts and asking for
judgment.
Judge Word reviews the relations
between the plaintiffs and the bank
from 1898, very briefly, and then says:
"In 1907 the holdings of the part
nership (Dengle Bros.) amounted to
about 1,500 acres. Thereafter, from
time to time, the partnership, with
money borrowed from the defendant
Bank of Fergus County, bought addi
tional lands until the land holdings of
the said partnership aggregated 8,500
acres, which is the approximate pres
ent ownership of the plaintiff corpor
ation called Dengle Bros.
"The proceeds from said lands and
from the sale of personal property
were not sufficient to meet the obli
gations of the partnership to said bank
on account of money borrowed. The
debt of the partnership to the bank
grew until in March, 1913, the Dengle
brothers signed and delivered to said
bank notes, one for $62,842.50 and one
for $14,583.35. Thereafter, in the same
year, four other advances, represent
ed by demand notes, were made by
said bank to the partnership and in
December, 1913, the six notes above
named, being the two large notes and
the four notes representing subse
quent advances, were computed in one
amount and new notes in renewal
thereof, three in number and equalling
said amount, were signed and deliv
ered by Dengle Bros, individually to
the Bank of Fergus County, and each
of said notes was indorsed by the in
dividual plaintiffs oilier than the
maker thereof and each of the notes
was secured by a pledge of bonds of
Dengle Bros., a corporation, and now
held by the bank.
"The court finds that said notes are
all and each of them due and unpaid
and that the total amount thereof,
with accrued interest on August 12,
1916, was and is in the sum of $84,
882.82: that in addition the Bank of
Fergus County in January, 1916, paid
taxes on the property amounting to
$1,083.82, and the court further finds
] that a reasonable attorneys' fee in
I ( . aR0 0 f suit being brought upon said
| notes and in this suit, as provided
j or j„ ea( .i, rnse j s the sum of $4,000.
] .. The court f inds that the defendant
i out support in the evidence.
j The conclusions of law follow:
| "That the defendant Bank of Fer
Bank of Fergus County held and now
holds as additional collateral security
for the payment of said notes a cer-;
tain note for $300,000 and stock of;
said Dengle Bros., a corporation.
No Fraud Nor Duress.
"The court further finds that the
charges of fraud, duress, imposition
and betrayal of trust, set out at
length in the complaint, are not true
in point of fact and are utterly with
i SX iiV. Cl* »
i .. , , , .,, m , ,
Ki's Conntv is entil ed to a judgment
i---s_.x than
1882.82 on account of said notes and
for the further sum of $1,083.82 on ac
j count of said taxes paid by the de-]
' fendant bank and for the further sum
of $4,000 on account of attorneys' lees,
as provided for in said notes,
"That the defendants are entitled to
have and recover from the plaintiffs
their costs herein expended,
"That upon the payment by the
plaintiffs to the defendants within the
time set out in the decree in this
cause (go davs from August 12) of the
seV eral sums and amounts and each

to the date of payment, the said plain

Fergus County any and all bonds,

The effect of this decision by Judge
Word is so clearly stated that no fur
ther explanation whatever is needed
to make its whole meaning plain.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 23—There
were two developments today in the
Mexican situation. Secretary Lansing
and Eliseo ArremUmdo, Mexican am
bassador-designate, tentatively agreed
that the joint commission lo discuss
border problems should meet at some
place on the New England coast dur
ing tlie first week in September. Brig
adier General Pershing transmitted
a report saying the general opinion
was that "Villa's prestige is gone
and that he can never again become
a serious factor in Mexican affairs."
Supporting, as it does, General
Funston's recent recommendation for
the withdrawal of tlie expeditionary
force in Mexico, it is believed Gen
eral Pershing's report makes it cer
tain that the American commissioners
will agree promptly to the suggestion
of their Mexican conferees for tlie
early recall of the troops.
Mr. Arrendondo called at tlie de

had been selected and were ready

for trial because of their relations
with Mariano Tames, the civilian vol
