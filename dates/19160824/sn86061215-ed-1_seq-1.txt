RAIL EMPLOYES

Further Dallying May Cause
Immediate Calling of
Threatened Strike
WILSON PARLEYS
WITH EMPLOYERS
President Discusses Needs
for New Legislation
With Congressmen
Washington, D. C., Aug. 23.—The
railway employes' committee showed
marked signs of unrest today at the
delay in the negotiations between
President Wilson and the railway ex
ecutives that the leaders of the men
were alarmed and openly expressed
fears of their ability to hold them
much longer.
An employes' meeting this morning
was thrown into an uproar by speeches
of a minority which demanded imme
diate action unless the roads accept
the president's plan but the leaders
succeeded in adjourning it before any
vote could be taken on any of the var
ious proposals. Some of the men
urged that most of them go home leav
ing the brotherhood heads with author
ity to call a strike if the railroads do
Hot accept the president's plan.
The meeting adjourned until 10
o'clock tomorrow morning. Frequent
ly shouts and applause were heard a
block away from the hall.
"It is our belief," one of the com
mitteemen said, "that the railroads are
playing for time with the president
Just as they have done with us for
many months."
The men, tired of the delay due to
the railroad representatives* prolonged
discussion of President Wilson's plan,
gave free expression to their opinions
at today's meeting.
They feel that the railroads show a
disposition to disregard their sacrifice
of the demand for time and a half
overtime.
A. B. Qarretson advised them to be
patient and assured them that deci
sive action was expected soon. He
refused to comment on the situation
other than to say, "It is in the hands
of the president."
Other leaders did not hesitate to
say, however, that plana have been
prepared for instant action in case the
railroad managers decline to accept
the president's proposal.
Road Heads Lay Plans.
Three railroad presidents today re
ported to the committee that is trying
to formulate an answer on behalf of
!the
roads to President Wilson's sug
gested plan for meeting demands of
the union brotherhoods the substance
of their conference with the president
j.at the white house last night. It is
understood the purpose of that visit
was to secure Mr. Wilson's specific
ideas on how the railroads are to re
imburse their treasuries for the many
millions additional expenses which
would arise out of acceding to the
president's plan for an eight hour day
wage basis.
Louis W. Hill, president of the Great
Northern railway and one of the
strongest opponents of the eight hour
day, declared today that many roads,
particularly western roads, would have
scant earnings next year and that
tnany would be forced into receiver
ships by an eight hour wage basis.
There were many indications that
the railroad presidents were consider
ing the eight hour day on condition
that some definite assurance be given
them that future disputes be arbi
trated.
President Holden of the Burlington
•aid the meeting of the presidents and
managers held this morning had re
cessed until 6 o'clock. Meantime the
special committee of the presidents is
in session.
Mr. Holden also stated that no con
clusion had been reached.
Discussing New Laws.
President Wilson summoned Sena
tor Newlands and Representative
Adamson, chairmen of the senate and
house commerce committees, to the
white house this morning. It is un
derstood he planned to discuss with
them legislation on the railroad strike
situation. The president's plan for
settlement of the railroad dispute
would create a commission to investi
gate the working of the eight hour day
and collateral Issues.
After their conference with Presi
dent Wilson, Senator Newlands and
Representative Adamson said they had
discussed the strike controversy gen
erally but that no legislation to meet
the situation had been gone over spe
cifically. The bill adding two mem
bers to the interstate commerce com
mission, which has-already passed the
I house and which will come before the
senate Friday, was one of the meas
ures discussed.

EXPEDITION HEALTHY.
Field Headquarters American Puni
tive Expedition, Mex., Aug. 23.—Only
six deaths from disease and a present
sick rate of 1.5 per cent for the Amer
ican punitive expedition since it en
tered Mexico more than five months
agQ was the record contained In of
ficial figures given out here yesterday
by the sanitary department. Adding
the number of sick being treated at the
base hospital to those in the field, the
rate Is increased to 2.5 per cent. There
has not been a single case of typhoid,
the prevailing ailment being dysentery.
"This is a remarkable record for an
expedition serving In this sort of a
country with nothing but field equip
ment," declared Gen. J. J. Pershing,
commander of the punitive expedi
tion, today when shown the depart
ment's figures. "It probably Is as low
a record as any similar expedition ever
has set out. Only once during the life
of the expedition has there been what
threatened to become an epidemic.
This occurred recently at a camp
south of headquarters, where the
water caused a number of cases of
amoebic dysentery.
"From available data It appears that
the sick rate In the expedition is leu
than half that of the United States."

by Rear Admiral Helm, which was
steaming out into* the Atlantic in
search of the "enemy" fleet under Ad
miral Mayo bound for American shores
with an imaginary army of Invasion
in thirty transports.
Not the least important aid to the
defending fleet was the navy depart
ment wtih Its means of gathering in
formation on the invaders' where
abouts from merchant vessels at sea.
Bent over their desks in the bureau
of communications, naval officers who
have made special study of codes
worked ceaselessly to solve the riddle
of the enemy's code system. They
had as material wireless messages
transmitted by Admiral Mayo's "red"
fleet, picked up by ships of Admiral
Helm's "blue" defensive fleet and re
layed to the Arlington wireless station.

Entente Troops Gaining in
Center While Bulgars
Advance on Wings
BRITONS RESUME
MOVE ON THIEPVAL
Fierce Fighting on Somme
Permits Germans to Get
Footing in Trenches
London, Aug. 23.—Political develop
ments in the Balkans overshadow In
Interest for the moment even the Im
portant military operations In prog
ress there but today's dispatches
throw little new light on the situation
from either a political or military
standpoint.
In connection with Rumania's atti
tude, the course of the Russian cam
paign in Bukowina close to the Ru
manian frontier is being closely
watched. Latest advices from Teuton
ic souroes, however, declare that the
Russians are being held up by the
Teutonic resistance, not only in the
Carpathian fighting, but along the en
tire front to the north In Galicia and
Volhynia.
The allies now have a formidable
army on the Macedonian front. So far,
however, It is only in the center, in
the Vardar valley, that entente ad
vances have been scored. The Bul
gars have gained on both flanks. It
seems not improbable that this re
gion, which offers superior railroad fa
cilities because of the line running
through it from Salonlki to Uskup,
has been selected as the main avenue
along which the entente thrust is to
be made.
Britons Still Gain.
On the western front, along the
Somme the British continue closing
In on Thiepval and apparently have
Gulllemont almost within their grip.
South of the Somme the French are
now being forced to light hard for re
tention of the trenches captured early
this week in the vicinity of Estrees,
and Paris reports today that the Ger
mans were able to gain a footing in
their former trenches.
Italians Again Advance.
The Italian artillery in the Gorizla
area 1b showing activity and work of
consolidating ground won east and
southeast of the captured town is be
ing completed. The Italians have
launched a new aggressive movement
in the Dolomites, the Alpine region on
the far northern front.
The Turks have attempted an offen
sive along the Black sea coast but Pet
rograd reports they were driven back
with the aid of the Russian Black sea
fleet.
In the east Berlin says lighting has
been heavy on the Stokhod and in the
Carpathians. Petrograd intimates that
Grand Duke Nicholas again is pressing
his offensive in the Caucasus.
GERMANS REPULSED.
Petrograd, Aug. 23. —The Germans
resumed the offensive yesterday south
of Brody, where the Russians are at
tempting to approach Lemberg from
the northeast. The war office state
ment of today says the Germans were
repulsed. The Russians captured two
heights on the Hungarian front, the
announcement says.
GERMANS COMPARE
LOSSES ON OCEAN
Berlin, Aug. 22.—Via London, Aug.
23.—The German admiralty Issued to
day a statement asserting that the
losses of the British and French nav
ies in line battleships and cruisers to
August 1 comprised seventy-two ves
sels with a total displacement of 496,
050 tons.
The German losses in the 6ame
classes during the same period were
twenty-five warships with a total of
62,667 tons. The list of British and
French warships included only those
losses which definitely had been es
tablished.
BRITONS GATHER
IN NEUTRAL BONDS
London, Aug. 23.—Further measures
are contemplated by the government
to bring about the mobilization of such
Canadian and neutral securities as
have not been turned over to the gov
ernment. In the house of commons
today the chancellor of the exchequer,
Reginald McKenna, said it was the In
tention of his department to apply to
parliament for the power to impose a
further income tax of two shillings on
the returns from all securities which
have not been deposited with the
treasury.
BRITISH CAPTAIN GUILTY.
Dublin, Aug. 23.—An inquiry into the
shooting without trial of three men
during the rebellion in Ireland last
spring was opened today in the four
courts. The cases are those of F.
Sheehy Skeffington, Fred Mclntyre
and Thomas Dickson. The men were
put to death at the orders of Capt
Bowen Colthrust, who was court mar
tialed and found guilty, but insane.

RUMANIA IS NOT
TET READY TO GET
BERLIN ANNOUNCES THAT RUS
SIAN AGENTS ARE VERY BUSY
IN THE COUNTRY.
Berlin, Aug. 23.—Rumania has not
decided whether she will enter the
war, in the opinion of a person char
acterized by the Overseas News agency
as "a distinguished diplomatist espec
ially conversant with Rumanian af
fairs."
On being asked by the news agency
as to the present situation he said:
"Rumania's attitude is due to her
geographical situation. The country
is virtually surrounded by belligerents.
Since the beginning of the present con
flagration the entente powers, par
ticularly Russia, have been extremely
active in Rumania. The country is
flooded with Russian agents and spies
of all desorlptlon. The entente uses
money lavishly to bribe politicians and
Influence the press. Rumania Is still
undecided."
THE BRITISH VIEW.
London, Aug. 23.—Developments in
the Balkans take first place this morn
ing in the newspapers, which display
keen Interest In the landing of the
Italian and Russian troops at Salonlki,
the possible actions by the Greek and
Rumanian governments and in the new
Russian offensive In Bukowina.
Unofficial dispatches say the Rus
sians are pushing ahead with the
greatest energy in Bukowina close to
the Rumanian frontier and already
have gained "a very brlalliant success."
The Daily News sums up the Balkan
situation as follows:
"The imminent general offensive
against Bulgaria is of great import
ance. One of the first results of a
successful offensive by Gen. Sarrail
would be a complete rupture of Ger
many's communications with the east
and the isolation «and capitulation of
Turkey.
"The situation In Greece, where
Greek troops already actually are en
gaged In hard fighting with their tra
ditional enemies, the Bulgars, Is rich
In possibilities. As to the Intentions
of Rumania, we may be content to
draw upon the German press which
says Rumania definitely has Joined
hands with the entente and Is prepar
ing to give Russian troops passage
through her territory. It is difficult
to conceive what motive the Germans
could have for circulating such a state
ment other than the belief that it Is
true."
SLAYERS FURNISH PUZZLE

TO TEST STATE'S RIGHTS
Railroads In Illinois Plan to Advance
Passenger Fare and Take Matter
Into Courts.
Chicago, Aug. 28.—Representatives
of all railroads operating in Illinois
are attending a conference here today
to discuss advancing passenger fares
between all points in the state from
2 to 2 2.4 cents a mile.
The law in Illinois Axes a maximum
of two cents a mile, but the interstate
commerce commission recently ruled
that it is a discrimination to charge
higher rates for interstate travel of
equal distance than for state trips.
The discrimination is to be abolish
ed by advancing state rates, it was
declared. The advance in passenger
fares will be in violation of the state
statute and will therefore involve the
question of state rights. The Illinois
case will be used as a test suit, it was
said.

Des Moines, Aug. 23.—C. S. Cooter,
