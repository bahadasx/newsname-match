MARY PICKFORD
IN POOR PEPPINA
LYRICJONIGHT
Though Mary Plckford has won her
greatest successes ln pathetic and
comic roles, her wonderfully versatile
interpretation of Fopplua .In too Fa
mous Players FHm Company's spec
tacular and thrilling Btory; "Poor
tiLlttlo Pepplna," pioves her-' tp be
equal to the most exacting of heroic
parts. The story of this latest' Para
mount Picture, which Is the. attrac
tion al tho Lyric tonight takes tho
UttLo heroine from Italy to S)clly and
and thenco to New York. ,
Pepplnn's real name Is Lois Tor
rens. She is tho daughter of a
wealthly American who lives iii Italy.
His testimony convicts Soldo bt mur
der and tho Italian, when he .escapes
from prison, steals Lois a mere baby
at tho tirao and hands her o,ver to
his relatives in Sicily calling her Pep
plna. Soldo escapes to America
where ho ultimately becomes an
opium smuggler. Pepplna Is engaged
to work in a vineyard which is owned
by a duchess of American parentage,
tho Duchess do Fernando, who takes
a great personal fancy to tho girl.
Whon Bernardo attempts to force
her to marry him despite tho interfer
ence of the duchess, Pepplna escapes
with the aid of her llttlo friend, Peppo
and dressed in boy's clothesbecomes
a stowaway on n ship bound for New
York. Hero she meets Hugh Carroll,
brother of tho duchess, who befriends
her without suspecting her 'Identity.
Arrived In New York, Pepplna, encoun
ters many difficulties as a 'newslo,"
bootblack, fruit vendor and messenger
boy, caught in an opium den by Soldo
and his friends, though theydo not
recognize her.
But Pepplna learns that JJoldo has
I written back to Itoly for his relatives
to send her to New York as ho. wants
to get money from Torrens for return-
Ing her. Torrens has tho placo raid-
i ' cd, but Soldo escapes. Then, as Pep
plna Is sent to Hugh Carroll's with
flowers, sho recognizes tho portrait of
her former benofactress. Tracing
tho raid to Hugh Soldo and his com
panions plan to kill him in revenge
by luring him to another ollice in his
own building. Pepplna discovers the
plot by accident and Is captured by
the gang and held prisoner. Dcsplto
her bonds, sho manages to ring the
tiro alarm and escapes In tho contus
ion to return with tho pollco and cap
ture tho entire gang.
Pcppina is taken to tho homo of
Hugh, where Torrens and his wire
havo called. Mrs. Torrens takes
chargo of tho supposedly exhausted
boy, but tho mumbling of a llttlo
prayer which Lois used to say when
a child arouses tho suspicion of tho
mother. Dy tho confession of ono of
tho conspirators and its perfect tally
ing with the story of Pepplna, her
real identity is disclosed. Thero Is a
very pretty lovo story running thro'
tho photoplay which has Its happy
I conclusions after llttlo Pepplna has
I been restored to her propor position
as tho daughter or n millionaire
Muiy plckford has boon surrounded
with a cast which includes somo of
tlio best-known Italian actors now ap
pearing on tho screen, among them
Cesaro Gravlna, Antonio Majorl, Ern
esto Tortl, N.Crovl, and Francesca
''auerra. In addition there appear on
tho roster Edwin Mordant, Eugeno
O'Brien, W. T. Carleton, and others.
Tho appoarenco of so many Latins In
this play, so much of wjikh takes
placo in Italy and Sicily, is only an
othor instance of tho determination
on tho part of tho producers to Invest
ovcry photoptay with tho most auth
entic atmosphere possible.

YOUNG MEN
ARE JOINING
REPUBLICANS
The outlook for a rich endowment
of young voters casting their lot w 1th
tho Republican party In Cacho county
this year Is exceptionally good.
Attorney L. E. Nelson, a graduato of
tho U. A. C. and a joiing man of con
siderable promise as a lawyer, hereby
announces that he expects to assist
In carrying tho banner of tho party
of Lincoln, McKlnlcy and Hughes and
that he will be found doing what ho
can to seo that Charles Evan Hughes
will bo elected president of the Unit
ed States at tho fall election and that
Nophl L. Morris is elected governor
of the stato of Utah.
"Thte is tho ago whero young men
must bo recognized," commented At
torney Nelson. "In glancing over the
state ticket as nominated at the lato
Republican stato convention, I ob
serve that tlw young men of this state
havo been given prominent places on
tho ticket. Especially Is this true
In the nomination made for governor.
Ncphl L. Morris Is a man who has
tho Interests of the young men of tho
state at heart. It vvob ho who has
been lighting to bring about a con
dition In this state that will place a
wholesome environment about the
young men and women of Utah In
'the matter of trying to secure prohi
bition at a tlmo when tho Isbuo was
not altogether popular. Now that tho
Issue is growing moro popular, and
he has been given n position on tho
ticket to bring about that condition
for which he has been fighting for
tho past eight years. I am quite sure
that tho young peoplo of Cache coun
ty will not overlook tho fact that of
all tho men In the Btato entitled to
bo elected, Ncphl L. Morris Is tho
man .
V expect' to work for tlw success of
the Republican party and for tho elec
tion of Its nominees on tho national
and state ticket."

Overindulgence In Hope.
Used with duo abstinence, hopo acts
as a healthful tonic; lntemperately
Indulged, as an enervating opiate.
Tho visions of futuro triumph, which
at first anlmato exortlon, If dwolt
upon too Intently, will usurp tho placo
of tho stern reality; and noblo objects
will bo contemplated, not for tholr
own Inherent worth, but on account
of tho day dreams thoy engender.
Thus hope, aldod by Imagination,
makes ono man a hero, anothor a
somnambulist and a third a lunatic,
and all enthusiasts. Stophon.
Women Spoil Watches.
It la n notorious fact that watches
owned by women aro less nccu'ato
than thoso carried by men. Tho causo
for this can bo directly nsslgncd to
tho Irregularity with which women
wind their watches and tho frequency
with which they allow thorn to run
down.

Drainage makes

our very door
Three Thousand Aere to Be Brought
Under Intensive Cultivation
Neap Logan City
Ono cannot get a good Idea of tho
Immensity of the drainage project
vhlch Is be.ng promoted by the Lo
gan Land and Drainage Company un
Icbs they make a trip over tho pro
Ject and hao It explained to them
by some one who has tho matter
clearly In hand. The writer made a
trip oer the project on Tuesday with
Manager A. F. Cardon and was Imp-
Dllv SUnirlspil tn Innrn llmi ulmt. H,n
lands which como under drainage
through tho work of this company, a
veritable empire of excellent farm
lands, to the extent of 3000 acres will
bo accessible to crops within a dls
tance of three miles from Logan City.
The major portion of tho lnnds
owned by this company are situated
west of the Logan river and to the
north of the county road which leads
direct to Mention after leaving tho
city Just south of the 0. S. L. de
put. At the present time tho Han
en Land and Llvo Stock Company
has tho lands leased and Is putting
up hay and pasturing cattle. The
lands, for the most part, without
drainage aro among some of tho best
In tho valley. There aro low places
which havo been drained already by
tho open ditches which have been dug
on tho river bottom lands north and
east, of the old ranch home of Joseph
tvr.1..l.. - .. nr .i .. . ..
) minus uuiir munuuu, imu mi'sc
are already producing a good crop of
wild hay Formerly these lands have
been allowed to collect water and
wero nothing but breeding places for
mosquitoes.
With tho drainage tile laid through
out tho various sections of this land
uud connected up with open ditches
which carry off the surplus water to
the river as an outlet, largo areas
will be broupht under cultivation
without tho breaks of swamp lands
hern 'and thero.
Tests of lands have been made to
determine the amount of salaratus
carried by lands and tests of the
amount of salaratus carried by the
water which Is being drained off tho
land havo been made, and thero Is
no doubt of tho fact that the salt
formations which havo previously
been coming to tho surface aro now
being carried oft by the system of
drainage.
Upwards of $50,000 has been spent
on tho project this season. Tho ma
jor portion of the lands aro now so
well taken care of that It will prob
ably be but a short tlmo until tho
company will begin to segregate the
lands and placo them on tho market
In tracts of ten, twenty, fifty, and a
hundred acres, Just tho alzo parcel
that a man who is living In town may
wish to own and farm outside the
city limits. Tho land thus reclaimed
and brought under cultivation wilt
i also wheat, beets, hay or most any
kind of a crop which can bo produc
ed In this valley and one can estim
ate what It will mean to Logan City
to havo all this land Immediately
brought under intensive cultivation.
It is to ho hoped that owners of
lauds similar to theso west of Logan
throughout Cacho Valloy will investi
gate what is being done by tho Lo
gan Land and Dralnago Company and
commence similar projects and In
this way many a good farm can bo
mado right here at home, Instead of
having our people go away frm
Cacho Valloy to get good farm lauds.
