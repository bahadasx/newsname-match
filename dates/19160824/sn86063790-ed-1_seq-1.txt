r a staunch believer in good schools,
t and as good roads go hand in hand
; with good schools, Mr. Miley believes
r that the time has arrived when we

ways. He had written into the ap>
propriation measure when he was in
the house one-half ;mill for good
roads and one mifl for permanent
bridges, and also had introduced a
law, and had it passed, increasing
f the width of public roads from .24
to 30 feet. He cited his record in
the house, and added that he would
, endeavor to represent the county in
, every way that would be beneficial.
He had had passed a law protecting
^ the people against wild-cat insurance
^ companies. If he is elected he will
serve the people to the best of his
5 ability.
Senator J. B. Black, who stands
f for reelection, said that he has done
7 the best he could in the senate. He
said that he is not. much on introducing
bills in the legislature, not
f usually offering more than two or
three during a session, while many
' members would offer maybe a dozen
^ a day, about "thirteen of which

L he has no axe to grind in the senate,
and knows no duty except his duty
to his constituents. He reiterated
his stand for a better system of common
schools, declaring "that he alI
ways had supported every measure
for their betterment. He cited the
record of the county in being free

3 friends who did not own real property
than who did. He promised to

PITCHFORK BURIED.
From Its Grave an Olive Tree Has
Grown, Says Senator Tillman.
_____ ?
Washington, August 19.?Senator
Tillman, in addressing the senate today,
referred to the recent speech of
Charles E. Hughes in which he said
that the majority of the leaders of
congress were from the South.
"It must have shocked and surprised
you senators," said the South
n i < * ? j .i . r-i
v^ttx uiiuct seuaiur, tu linu uia,i o jl
years after Appomatox, that a candidate
for the high office of president
of these re-United States has thought
it necessary to drag forth that old
blood-and-mud bespattered banner of
sectionalism and wave it over the
heads of the present generation of
Americans.''
He declared that if the majority of
the leaders in congress were from
the South they had attained to their
present rank through long service,
just as he had done.
"I did not earn the nickname of
'Pitchfork' on account of my partisanship,"
continued Senator Tillman,
"It was due to the bluntness and
frankness with which I spoke. My
mother taught me to despise * hypocrisy
and lying above all else, and
I owe this personal characteristic to
her. If I ever did hate the Northern
people?and I confessed to that
the last time I spoke here?that
hatred and partisanship have died
out of my heart; and the pitchfork,
if it was considered the emblem of
it, has long since been buried. From -v
its grave an olive tree has grown and \
I am tendering the olive branch,
claiming to represent the South in
doing so, to all Northern people.
"Let me before taking leave, to
_ o " >x
meet you again, by the mercy of God,
in December, hold it out to you and
through all of you, to the constituencies
which you represent, in the
earnest hope that it may silence this
unjustifiable and1 unseeming cry of
'sectionalism,' even as it once herded
the receding waters of the deluge."

Admitting Three Homicides. ^
Lake Charlee, La., Aug. 17.?Hel- / .
aire Carriere, former convict and
slayer of Sheriff Swords, of Saint'
Landry parish, tonight made a state- ' '
a*
ment to District Attorney Edwards, N .< >
of Calcasieu parish, in which he admitted
he had killed three persons
during the past year, and expressed
regret that he had not made the total ,
greater. Besides Sheriff Sworde, ~~
Carriere said, he killed Daye Pierce,
a negro, near Jennings, La., in selfdefence,
and shot and killed an 18year-old
negro boy in the Mallett

they had driven him to desperation.
