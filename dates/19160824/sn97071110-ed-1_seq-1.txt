This store never wab-
bles on the question of greater-value-giving. Our
merchandise is purchased on a quality basis from
such quality clothes makers as
THE HOUSE OF
KUPPENHEIMER
. We believe in the thorough goodness of these
suits. We have judged them by careful comparison
and actual tests and we know that at
$18, $20, $22, $25
we are giving men more for their money in these
clothes, than is possible in any other make at the
same price.
We know also that these suits could stand a
higher .price. We know that on inspection you
would pay three to five dollars more than we ask,
and you would get your money's worth. But this
store never wabbles in its decision to give greater
value. ,

The reasons for this condition are- many
and vary in every location, but main reason
in our line is indifference of the buyer as to

physical examinations given by Major
C. Brosius. bsd sinned the official
roster and after the Brit rollcall it was
discovered that but 56 recruita were in
line. To muster in under the Federal
Articleaof War a minimum list of 65 is
necessary. A roll of the absent men
was called.
Three were away at the Green Point
mill of the Stanley-Smith Lumber Co.
One man, according to responses of
friends, waa away at a wedding. Oth
ers were joyriding. Members or tne
prospective company were Informally
detailed to bring in enough men to fill
the ranks to 65. Automobilea were
pressed into service. A West Side
rsnch lad was summoned from hia bed.
The whirring of a telephone bell inter
rupted the service of a wedidng, but
at 10.30 o'clock 64 eligible men stood in
line. At the time the search of a 65th
artilleryman seemed futile.
If it is necessary, declared Koy V.
Smith, aa he atepped into the ranks,
I'll enlist."
A cheer resounded through the hall.
Mr. Smith is a veteran of the Spanish
American war, having aeen active ser
vice aa a regular in the Fhilippinea.
A younger recruit, however, was
rustled into the room within a few
minutes, and Mr. Smith was released.
Geo. K. Wilbur, eity attorney and
Spanish-American war veteran, was
lected captain of the new company.
The new organization will make a
temporary armory of the ball room of
the Heilbronner building. Aa soon as

The organization or tne new artillery
company had its origin in the bast
Side orchard district. At the instiga
tion of Ned Van Horn 45 young men
signed an informal roll and petitioned
for the organisation. The additional
men come from the ranks of profes
sional and business men of the city and
ranchera of the Dee and Oak Grove
districts.
Oregoa'a military lawa provide for a
minimum of 75 in a company of coast
artillery, and it will be necessary to
recruit 10 more men in the next 10
days.
AUTOMOBIIiSTS BRING
HOME NEW IDEAS
Just home from long automobile
tours, both Or. H. L. Dumble and
E. W. Birge have aeen on the roads
sbroad principles in road building and
methods of appealing to the touring
automobile party that, according to
their statements, they will work for in
Hood Kiver county.
Dr. Uumble, accompanied by Mrs.
Dumble and Mr. and Mrs. P. H. Cool-
idge, toured a total of 1,000 miles
while away. Leaving here he traveled
down to Portland and thence up the
Willamette valley to Eugene. Dr.
Dumble visited automobile parka at
Eugene and the famous Ashland camp
ing place for the motor tourist.
'Hood Kiver must naves an automo
bile park." he declares, "and Monday
ight 1 put a proposition before the
city council. We have adequate sites
west or town, uuy .evaier can De
piped to the wooded spots, and 1 think
the local power com Dan v will be will

people of Hood River do not feel that
a park can oe proviaea Dy taxation

matter and provide it by private sub
crintion."
Ur. DumDie says mat tne Asnaino
automobile park is attracting wide
snread attention to the southern Ore
eon city. Nineteen sues lor nineteen
machines have been supplied. The
different camping placea, well marked
by posts and numbered, are lurnianea

"On August; 1 my wife and I left
Hood Kiver equipped with a complete
camping outflt including a well stocked
eommisssry, but found it quite conven
ient to make a town each night, aa a
good part of the country traversed is
not what could be termed an ideal
camping proposition. Goldendsle waa
the first town visited after leaving
Hood Kiver via the ferry to White
Salmon. The Snowden road via Lyle ia
the aborter route, being 68 miles and a
comfortable four hours' run over a
fairly good country road.

have been worse. Thia road leads into

splendid highways of western Washing

that Oregon ia greatly deficient in com

anything that could have been done
and is figured aa an investment never

Why. out of Seattle and Tacoma in
all directions stretch these delightful
highways. The Olympia highway ex
tending out the Olympia peninsula to
the ocean, a distance of 250 miles, is a
graveled boulevard for nearly the en
tire distance. The Sunset highway,

Many or the email towna we passed
through if not on the direct highway
are building good hard surfaced roada
from the farming districta into town.
In the Puvallup the? have a concrete
highway extending the length of the
valley, a diatsnce of some 20 miles and
connecting with the Seattle, Tacoma
and Sumner concrete and brick paveo

"It ia to be hoped that when the op
portunity comes to the people of Ore

From Seattle to Portland was over
the Pacific highway, a distance of 215
milea. When it comes to the last leg
of the journey, I will put on the soft

have hopes and our own dear highway,
the most scenic of the whole trip, will
be our pride and joy forever."
B. T. COIT KILLS
SELF WITH RIFLE
A bullet hole through bia head,, the
body of B. T. Coit, an Upper Valley
rancher, waa found Sunday afternoon
by a transient laborer, who had caned
at the dead man's place to seek em
ployment. A rifle lying by young
Coit's side bore mute evidence of sui
cide. Dr. V. R. Abraham, county cor
oner, summoned to the scene, waa given
a sealed letter, in which tne young man
bade farewell to his father. In a few
brief words he announced the intention
of killing himself, but offered no ex
planation for the act.
Young Coit was but 22 years old.
He came to the Upper Valley two years
ago, purchasing an orchard place on
which be had begun development. He
had just completed a handsome log
bungalow, said to be one of the most
pretentious and unique residencea in
the Hood River valley. A rumor pre
vailed to the effect that the-new home
had been built for a prospective bride,
but that the girl had jilted young Coit.
Close friends of the young man, bow
ever, deny that there ia any truth in
the rumor. The young man was or a
reticent nature.and resided at his place
alone.
The dead man is said to come from a
wealthy New Jersey fsmily. His fa
ther, John T. Coit, recently retired
from New York business affairs, re
sides in Orange, N. J.
The bods of young Coit waa brought
to Anderson's undertaking establish
ment Monday afternoon.
The remains were shipped to the
esstern home for interment last night.

Benson Delay Explained
Refuting recent rumora to the effect
that S. Benson had delayed in starting
on the construction of a Columbia Riv
er highway paving between the Mult
nomah county line and lascsae locks
becauae the Hood River county court
bad refused a promise to maintain the
road, C. N. Ravlin, who waa recently
present aa a Hood River county rep
resentative at a meeting of the State
Highway Commission, says that it waa
then agreed that Mr. Benson should
postpone his donation mile of road.
"Mr. Benson agreed to delay the
construction work, in order that the
funds he will appropriate may be used
in mstcbing the $78,000 available for
Oregon under the Sheldrske bill," saya
Mr. Ravlin.
Apple Freights Reduced
Railway systems, according to an
announcement of the Fruit Growera'
Exchange, have voluntarily reduced tha
freight rate on apples between Hood
River, Mosier and The Dalles and Ari
zona points. The ratea from Hood
Kiver, Moaier ana ine uaues to bib Dee
and Douglas, respectively of $1.15 and
$1.17 per hundred weight, have been
reduced to si.iw ror tiooo Kiver ana
$1.10 for Moaier and The Dal lea.
The new rata will bring a saving of
about three cents per box, or about $20
per car. The reduction was made at
the Instigstion of the Northwestern
Fruit Exchange.
