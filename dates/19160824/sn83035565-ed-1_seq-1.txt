Editorial Comment.
Fna the Uhl Mrpabllraa Kdlterlal
Aaaoelatlon.
By Claude C. Waltermire.
A news item disseminated from
Columbus stated that the prima
ry vote indicates that Cox will
make a campaign with practical
ly a united Democratic party, so
far as the governoiship is con-
cerr.ed. And this in the face of
the inescapable fact that out of
the first sixtyseven .counties -t6
make official returns. Cox re
ceived 106.163 votes, while 40,
571 Democrats went to the polls
and deliberately voted against
him. Two out of every seven
Democrats declared the'r antag
onism to him. To call this a
"practically united" party is to
trifle with the truth. The full
official returns will tell even a
more interesting story.
" The most potent political influ
ence in Ohio politics is the letter
"A." It makes and unmakes
nominations. It joy rides over
political organizations and chases
the bosses off the map. One,
and the letter "A" are apt to be
a majority.
President Wilson is a minority
president. He was elected in
1912 because the Republican par
ty was hopelessly divided- Now
the Progressives have returned.
. .The Republican party has unified
itself and is again the majority
party. To add to Wilson 's weak
ness, the women voters of the
country are declaring against
him, making sure his defeat in
the twelve western states where
they have the suffrage. It looks
as though he will have only the
Solid South in the electoral col
lege. '
In the recent primary John J.
Lentz found time to, give Timo
thy Hogan, former attorney gen
eral under Cox, a resounding
whack. He pointed out Where
Hogan, in his first year, caught
in the general whirl of Cox ex
travagance, jumped the expense
of his office from $03,800 to $94,
373. The next year he ran up
the cost to what Mr. Lentz calls
the "awful sum" 'of $129,019.
Then he pulls the deadly parallel
on Hogan by showing that his
Republican successor, Attorney
General Turner, conducted the
same office, for eighteen months
for $101,499, making an average
monthly saving of $5,111. As
one of the Democratic candidates
for the nomination for United
States Senator, this statement of
Mr, Lentz will hardly be disput
ed, even by Democrats. The
fact is conceded that there was
general waste and extravagance
everywhere under the Cox ad
ministration. There has been a
return of economy under the
Willis administration in every di
rection. Mr. Lentz has perform
ed a public service in contrast
- ing Hogan's waste of the tax
payers' money , with Turner's
saving of it' - ,.- ( v
'Mrs. McNamara, who is mat
ron of the Girl's' Industrial Home
and a hold-over: Cox appointee,
says the proposed investigation
of the parole system at the Home
is an attempt to oust her from
her position. It seems that thir
teen girl3 paroled from the insti
tution last year and ' placed in
private homes have since given
birth to illegitimate children. Dr.
E. H. Rorick of the state board
of administration refuses to ign
any more paroles until this re
markable condition can be inves
tigated, and Governor Willis has
asked that the whole matter be
examined into and steps taken to
protect wards of the state from
ruin in the future. Certainly the
unfortunates at Delaware should
have every safeguard possible
thrown around them when they
go out into the world, and public
sentiment will sustain Governor
Willis and Dr. Rorick in their ef
forts to better the unfortunate con
dition of affairs found to exist.
How will the dinner pail be
filled when the munition factory
is closed?
The Columbus Dispatch, Cox-
Wolfe publication, has this to say
concerning the care and food
which the state Wards are receiv
ing in the various institutions ov
er the state:
"The state is feeding several
fine herds of young cattle which
will soon be butchered and the
meat served on the table of the
institutions. . At practically all of
the places there is enough poul
try raised to supply the demand
of eggs and poultry for table use.
"Hundreds of fine milk cows
are furnishing fresh milk every
day for all state institutions, and
at practically all of them fresh
churned butter is being delivered
daily. No oleomargarine or sub
stitute for butter is being used
anywhere. The canned fruits
are coming direct from Califor
nia,, the sugar direct from, the re
fineries, the coffee direct from
the plantations, while the pota
toes, tomatoes, com, beans and
other garden vegetables are bro't
fresh from the state gardens to
the table3 of the wards who are
inmates of the various institu
tions.
"And the best of it is that
while these unfortunates are be
ing better fed, it is being done
cheaper than ever before."
"1 .
Hughes abolished gambling in
the state of New York. "
The Standard dictionary de
fines a certain word as meaning
to "Change from one purpose or
opinion to another and back a-
gain, as under influence of op
posing motives; fluctuate in mind;
be irresolute ; waver. " The word
itself is "vacillate," but a short
er and ' better definition is to
Wilsonize." For sheer versatili
ty in vacillation, Woodrow is in a
class by himself, and he has giv
en its vibrations a volition which
they have never had before.
"Adequate preparedness is not
militarism. It is essential assur
ance of security. It is a neces
sary safeguard of peace." Chas.
E. Huphes,
Noticeable in the complete re
turns is the fact that the larger
votes of protest against the re
nomination of Mr. Cox are in the
rock-ribbed Democratic counties
the rural counties in which
Democrats furnished the plurali
ty which elected Willis, by bolt
ing Cox. In some of these coun
ties Cox was not given a majori
ty of the party vote all the ma.
chine vote is always out and is
most likely to controj, in a light
vote.
Charles E. Hughes, criticising
the appointment by President
Wilson of Dr. Jones to be thi
head of the Coast Survey, sa'd
that while he was an excellent
veterinary surgeon, that he had
no ' knowledge of coast survey
work and his appointment wa
purely political. Whereupon the
Democratic administration comes
back with the delicious response
that 4 'Dr. Jones was never a vet
erinary surgeon, tie is a gen
tleman of education and refine
ment.'' Mr. Hughes' point Etill
stands, and besides, the veterin
ary surgeons all over the country
are giving three rousing cheers
for Wilson but not so loud that
you can hear them.
The effort of Governor Willis
to bring about economy i de
partment expenditures is begin-
ning to'show results that will
please all taxpayers. For exam
ple, the state liquor license board
decreased its expenditures for
the year closing June 30, 1916, in
the sum of $43,752.76, as com
pared with the year ending June
30, 1915. At the same time it
increased its receipts for the state
in the sum of $20,576.42. A to
tal gain of $64,329.18 in one de
partment in a single year must
satisfy the people that there was
great waste and lcose manage
ment under the Cox administra
tion. Your Bowels Should Move

of the fiuest vaudeville acts which
ever appeared at a state fair. ,
Oelmar Is Sensation.
The vaudeville acts are featured by
Gus Hombrook's Congress of Riders,
declared to be the most sensational in
the country. "Delmar," the world's
greatest hind foot walking horse, rid
den by Adela Von OhI, a noted horse
woman, who has achieved world-wide
fame with her steed, is the feature. He
will pivot, march and walk on his
hind legs. He is a big chestnut in
color, and makes a wonderful picture.
The Congress of Riders will make the
spectators stand np in their seats and
applaud. Real cowgirls, Mexicans and
Indians, cowboys, and a collection of
wonderful horses, will give an exhibi
tion of daring and horsemanship
which is said to be unequaled.
Not less spectacular: in perform
ance are the other acts. These Include
the original Tony Floreni Troupe, con
sistlng of two ladies, and four gen
tlemen, who, attired In evening
clothes, give the ' most sensational
ground acrobatic act In the show bus
iness. They have been the sensation
of Europe's largest vaudeville houses
and the circus. '
Dare-Devlls of the Air.
The Five Hying Munlchs. called the
"dare-devils of tha air," are supreme,
Incomparable aerial stars, fearlessly
flying from end to end of their mam
moth, rlssrtnr, ,rth;s.:wifh un

do they perform in this breathless
manner at first, but all through their
act. '

tional "whip crackers," are from Aus
tralia. Burt Shepard is called the
"Buffalo Bill" of Australia He pre
sents a series of wonderful and thril
ling feats with gigantic Australian
whips from the back of a galloping
horse. His manipulation of the Bus
velot whips is the greatest In tht
world.
Nettie Carroll and Company, tight
wire artists, are features at the State
Fair. They were sensations for two
years at the New York Hippodrome,
ending last year. Bud Snyder and com
pany are considered the greatest bi

BLOODY PROSPERITY.
Ns en fJUputcs a temporary prosperity in our Ibnci tod-y. But it is
sectional in its factory aspect, abnormal in its feve:'d rush, fic.itious in
its essentials and perverting in its tendency. Worse; it is the gold
sluiced from tha river of blood, poured out by the horrifying sacrifice of
millions of our fellow men. God forbid that we should boast a prosperity
wrought in such waste of human life. We had rather rejoice in tha
prosperity of peace. United States Senator Warren G. Harding.
DETROIT'S IMPRESSIONS OF
Governor Hughes' visit to Detroit opened tha presidential campaign
of 191, and if we may forecast the events that are to follow by tha omans
of Monday wa would prognosticate an intensely warm, vivid and humanly
Interesting period in the next few months.
Setting aside the auspices of meteorological conditions in this previ
sion of the future although thay are approved by numerous professional
augurs and by a host of commonalty as well we bate this prophecy on
tha characteristics ef the eandidate whose too brief stay with us has
been enjoyed by all with whom he came into contact.
The misguided individuals who have been expecting Charles E. Hughes
would prove to be a cold proposition and therefore easy to beat are in for
a shock that will make them think they have been hit by an uninsulated
trolley wire. There ia nothing cold about Mr. Hughes, Detroit has learn
ed. He is about as intensely human a piece of humanity as ever captured
the hearts of a orowd, and tha more people in the United States he meets
between now and November the mora votes will be cast for him. As a
campaigner he is a revelation. Ha likes his fellow beinge, and they like
him because they see he likes them.
And what his personality begins his remarkable powers of intellect
and utterance finish. Ho drives his points home with tremendous force.
What he says sticks. There are thousands of Americans today who can
retell every stop in the arguments he made eight years ago on the Bryan
trust policy, yet in 1908 Mr. Hughes was not especially a prominent figure
and there was no particular reason why his address more than others
should have remained clearly in tha memory except the gift of the man to
end his own thoughts so deep into the brains, of others. They are clear
. In his own ntiod hnt, undoubtedly.' Ha knows precisely what ha wants to
ay because he has reasoned it out before he speaka it out. Probably that
has something to do with tha ease with which ho conveys his meaning.
But it is a vary rare quality ha possesses in his ability to master subjects
se thoroughly as to make tha most, abstruse simple to himself and his
hearers. It is a quality eminently desirable in a political candidate. It is
infinjtely more to be desired in the president of a great country like tha
United States.
Detroit's impression of Charles E. Hughes is all favorable. Tha thou
sands of people who hava atudiad him at close range are convinced that
if ha ia elected president next November he wilt be a great president, one
of the groateat this nation has known,' worthy to stand in history with
George Waahington and Abraham Lincoln, a custodian of the republic's
fata to whom that fate may confidently be intructed. If that conviction
is shared by the people of other states whom he is still to meet the out
come of his swing around the great American circle cannot fail to be pro
pitious for him. Detroit Free Press.
"When wo contemplate lndus-
trial and commercial conditions
we see that we arc living in a
fool's paradise. The temporary
prosperity to . which our oppo-
nents point has been created by
the abnormal conditions lntl-
dent to the war. With the end
of the war there will be the
new conditions determined by a
new Europe. Millions of men
In the trenches will then return
to work. The energies of each
of the now belligerent nations,
highly trained, will then be turn-
ed to production." Charles E.
Hughes.

"No one could successfully present

"No such thing as prosperity exists

It exists for all."
"The Republican party does not

A MAN.
Now thut Mr. Hughes knows he hat
been nominated for president we may
wait patiently a few days longer to
hear what Mr. Wilson has to sa
about it.
The psychologist who said that any
body can be hypnotized offers the most
encouragement that Carranza has yet
found for his hopes of borrowing
money.

MR. HUGHES OPPOSED TO
FOOLISH GOVERNMENT.
"I have no respect for the idea
that because democratic govern
ment Is a government of the peo
ple, by the people and for the
people It is a government of the
foolish, for the foolish and by
the foolish." From Mr. Hughes'
Speech at Chicago.
NO PROTECTIVE MEASURE
FROM DEMOCRATIC
CONGRESS.
"You couldn't get a protective
measure out of a Democratic
congress sectionally organized
any mora than you could get a
revival meeting cut of a disorder
ly house." From Mr. Hughes'
Speech at Chicago.
BURSTING A BUBBLE.
The Democrats who sought a crit
icism from Dr. Charles W. Eliot of
Mr. Huahes' acceptance of the presi
dential nomination got one, but not
the kind they wanted. Dr. Eliot was
heartless. Instead of helping the Dem
ocrats keep the .supreme court bubble
in the air he pricked it with a pin
when in his letter he said of Mr.
Hughes action:
"Most Americans will think thut,
having tried the life of a governor and
the life of a justice of the supreme
court, he had a right to give effect to
bis preference for political service."

Mr. Lansing is credited with the be
lief that the case against Great Britain
on account of the blacklist is so weak
that it ought not to be pressed. What,
then, dd Mr. Tolk mean when he
called the attention of the British gov
ernment, "in the gravest terms," to
"the many serious consequences" to
be apprehended if it were not withdrawn!
