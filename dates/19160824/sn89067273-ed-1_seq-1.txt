The cooler weather Is here and bo
1b the Mexico Chautauqua. The pro
gramme opened Monday afternoon
and the throngs attending the ten
sions are by far the largest In the
history of Chautauqua attendance
here. The King's Daughters sold ev
ery ticket put In their hands and
more are called for.
Chaplain Lougher, of Michigan,
made the address at the opening. He
Is the champion of the Newer Crim
inology. He has traveled In British
India and all over the world and vis
ited every large prison. He con
demns present-day prisons and says
most of them do more to Increase
crime than to reduce Its prevalence.
The majority of criminals are grad
uates of reform schools. You can't
segregate boys, already bad, where
they can exchange Ideas with other
bad boys and expect them to break
off their badness.
Dr. Lougher proposes the Mich
igan plan of county farms to better
conditions. Seven big state farms
are operated In Michigan and 800
convicts have been paroled In three
years and 'only three men have run
away. The State has made $100,000
profits annually in these operations
and sent back home standard wages
to the families of convicts. Lbugher's
speech was an eye-ojiener.

Fitty-Blx oil and gasoline burning
farm tractors plowed 100 acres on
the Charles E. Clump farm on
Brown road near Clinton road, St.
Louis county, in two hours and fif
teen minutes as a part of the St
Louis Tractor Farming Demonstra
tion at Kinloch Park. A man with
an ordinary plow and horse would
take several weeks to do the same
amount of work, it is estimated.
About 8,000 persons, mostly farm
era, witnessed the demonstration.
Many of the tractors drew as many
as six plows. And several of the
smaller machines were used to draw
disks, harrows and drags.
Have you mowed those weeds?
Then your farm is worth more and
you are a better neighbor and a bet
ter citizen thau if you hadn't. Ev
eryone thinks more of the farmer
and farm If he sees the weeds neatly
mowed as he drives along a well
dragged road. As he pusses the end
of the line fence he sees a 'fence
row, not 0 weed row, and the same Is
true of the cross fence.
Whole tomatoes, green peppers,
spinach, and corn on the cob every
day next winter! Doesn't the
thought suggest a pleasant depar
ture from too much meat In the diet?
Every woman on the farm and the
men wi'l not forget to help too
should can surplus fruits and vee
ables during tbo summer months
for winter use,' says Miss Addle I).
Root of the Mlasouri College of Ag
riculture, By so doing, the cost of
a valuahle food will be decreased
and meals during tho winter will be
mada more appetizing. Fruits and
vegetables give variety to the diet
and supply certain food materials
which are ' necessary to maintain
health. They do not leave us In
need ot a spring tonic.
