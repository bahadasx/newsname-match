BULGAR SIS GUfiS
DRIVt CREEKS
OF SERES
Athens Government C diets Evacu
ation of Ancient City
GREEKS THROW UP DEFENCES
Allied Opposition Has Brought Ad
vance of Bulgarians to Standstill
Along Entire Line.
London, Aug. 24. The ancient
Greek city of Seres, 4;; nines from Sa-
oniki, is being evacuated by flie
Greek garrison following a bombard
ment by the Unitarians, according to
dispatch from Athens.
The Greeks are co-Operating with
the French. The French artillery is
replying to the big guns of the llul
gars anil the Greeks are digging en
trenchments. The Dulgar advance along the en
tire! front is reported to have come to
i standstill; but the Serbs have been
Voiced to concede some ground on
the right wing.
The evacuation of Seres followed an
order to that effect from the Greek
government, an Athens dispatch
states, after the citv had been bom
barded by the liulgars.
London. Aug. 23. The Bulgarian
advance into Greece may be the spark
that will set Greece allame and lead
her at last into the war on the side of
the Allies. Despatches from Salonica
say that all the Greek reserves about
Seres, in northeastern Greece, have
been called to the colors and at Sa
loniea volunteer! are being raised to
light the hulgars.
A proclamation Issued by the Greek
commander at Seres says that he will
attack the Mulgarians, who are now
advancing toward the town. The
pioclamatlon calls out all the Greek
reservists in the district, who were
demobilized a short time ago, after
having been under arms almost since
the war began.
In Salonica leaders of the Liberal,
or Venlzelos party, are raising a body
of Greek volunteers to go at once to
Seres and aid the Greek troops there
to repulse the advance of the Mul
garians. Greek troops already have
been reported as tiring on the Mulgars.
It has been declared that the latter
had promised not to occupy Seres,
Drama or Kovala.
It is believed here that the Teutonic
.offensive, Intended to anticipate the
offensive the Allies have now started,
has over reached itself and that Bul
gar inroads into Greece will so arouse
the Greeks against their ancient foe
that not even King Constantino, who
is the Kaiser's brother-in-law, can keep
them from joining the Allies.
Meanwhile attention here continues
to be fixed on Rumania. Several news
papers declare that. Influenced by the
success of the Russian offensive in
the Carpathians toward Hungary at
points not far from her northern boun
daiy. Rumania will not delav much
longer in throwing In her lot with the

The schooners, according to the

CHURCHILL PREDICTS LONG WAR
Urges Government Control of Food
Supplies at Home and Overseas.
London, Aug. 23. On the presenta
tion of the motion toduy for the ad
journment of the House of Commons
for the summer vacation, Col. Win
ston Spencer Chun hill, formerly first
lord of the admiralty, initiuted a de
bate on the conduct of the war. He
said there was no certainty of a
speedy ending of the conflict. Ger
man armies were more numerous and
better equipped than ever, but what
reserves they had was another mat
te'. Colonel Churchill urged that the
country should be organized for a
long war. and that food supplies ami
.iii es should be put on a war basis.
He also recommended the chartering
of all shipping at admiralty rates, thus
putting an end to the rise in freights.
which he characterized as a national
scandal, instead ol restricting con
sumption by the agency of increased
prices the government, he said, should
take control of the distribution of food
supplies at home and overseas.
The long eastern front, Colonel
Churchill argued, was the most vol
Iterable and the inexhaustible armies
which Russia was able to bring into
operation should be utilized fully. On
that account he urged the chancellor
of the exchequer not to permit linan
cial considerations to stand in the
way of providing Russia to her utmost
needs with munitions ami equipment
upon which, he said, everything now
depended
In reply to a question Premier As
quith said that he could not under

EIGHT-HOUR DAY
ONLY PUN 10
AVERT STRIKE
Conviction Forcing Itself Upon In
terested Parties
MORE CONFERENCES BEING HELD
Railroads Executives Searching for
Plan to Put Eight-Hour Day Into
Eftect.
Washington, Aug. 24. In another
effort to aid the presidents of the coun
try's railroads tg find some way in
which to accept an eight-hour day for
their trainmen to avert the threatened
strike. President Wilson last night
conlerred for 1 1-2 hours with Presi
dents Hale Hohien of the Burlington,
Daniel W'illanl of the Maltimore and
Ohio, and R. S. LOVett of the Union
Pacific,
Neither White House officials nor
the presidents would discuss the con
ference. It was said on authority,
however, that the three executives
weui io tne lute House to receive an
mswer to the suggestion thev made
to Mr. Wilson Tuesday night, that he
give them more specific information
as in Know the railroads mav get the
idditional revenue necessary to take
are of the greater payrolls that will
ome with the eight-hour day.
It became evident last night that
most of the railroads' executives have
ome to believe that there can be only
one way of preventing a strike, and
that Is by accepting the eight-hour
dan. The chief effort in their own
conferences yesterday was to find
some scheme by which an eight-hour
day may be put in operation on all
the railroads at the least added ex
pense. Many suggestions along this
lint have been made by the president,
but not one of them has proved feas-
Die when submitted to the add test
ol operating officials.
At the conclusion of their confer
ence last night with the nresldcnm
uul managers. Hale Holdon, president
of the Burlington and a member of
the committee of eight gave out the
following statement:
Tile railway executives who have
met her at the request of President
Wilson are proceeding as rapidly as
practicable with their work. It must
be understood, however, the problem
with Which' these nun are wrestling is
the most important and gigantic ever
presented to any body of men in the
industrial history of the country.
'I hey cannot, therefore, consistent
I with their duty to their security
holders, their employes or the public,
reach a tinal conclusion regarding
what action they should take without
much discussion, study and thought.
rinse deliberations, participated In
by practically 100 men suddenly
culled together from all parts of the
United States, require time.
"If our deliberations seem to pro
ceed slowly It la due to the facts that
I have mentioned. For us to ut hasti
ly would be a betrayal of the great re
spenslbillty we owe to all the purges
((.met tied, ami. must of all. to the
public."
As the conference tontlnnued yesKT
day it became more evident that the
principal difficulty or the situatioi. is
to work out a plan of action ac apt
able to all the rallroaus.
It is well Understood '.hat nnt of
the executives now ar OOUVillCed that
the eight-hour day In some form must
he conceded and that they cannot ex
pect President Wilson to recede from
the position be has publicly taken
Their efforts were directed yesterday
to the discovery of n solution of the
complicated questions of operation un
der an eight hour day and It was said
last night on the authority of many of
them that no practical plan had been
developed.

VILLA'S PRESTIGE
IS BROKEN, SAYS
Bandit No Longer Serious Factor
in Mexican Affair
HAS BEEN IN HIDING SINCE APRIL
His Last Attempt to Secure a Follow
ing Resulted in Complete
Failure.
Washington, Aug. 23. In a telegram
to the war department today Brig
Gen. Pershing reported that Villa's
prestige Is gone and that he can never
again become a serious factor in
Mexican affairs.
The despatch, sent from the expedi
tionary headquarters at Colonia Dub
Ian, follows:
"My last report regarding Villa at
tack on Parral is now reported to be
incorrect. Villa had only small fol
lowing. He avoided Parral and places
occupied by Carranza troops. He was
making bis way south into Durango.
Probably now hiding in mountains.
"Until recently Villa has been hid
ing since being driven to mountains of
southern Chihuahua by our troops last
April. His late attempt to obtain fol
lowing reported as almost total fail
ure. Opinion seems general that Vil
la's prestige is gone and that he can
never again become serious factor In
Mexican affairs."
Army officers here were inclined to
regard the report of Villa's loss of
prestige as nu.st Important and likely
to have a bearing on the question of
the withdrawal of tho American forc
es in Mexico.
