The Deadly ..Grade Crossing
Tho grade crossing is the place
of death. Thejstory in yester
day's Herald relating the details
of the tragedyyjiear Spring Sta
tion Tuesday afjornoon is typical
of a large proportion of the fatal
railway accidentsi As long as
the grade crossfKgs are tolerated
we may expecto hear frequent
ly of accidents 0,f this type.
Their frequent recurrence does
not appear to belli sufficient warn
ing to those wio travel on the
highways to iudiico the necessary
precautions atr-jrade crossings to
prevent such accidents. Eventu
ally some meags will bo. taken
for Hie more adequate protection
of the lives 6'fUhoso who must
use the public roads.
As far as cojld be learned jio
particular individual was direct
ly responsible .(jpr the frightful
accident of- Tuesday afternoon.

Overseers Notified.
All the road overseers of the
county have had legal notice
served on them to put their roa'ds
in condition at once or show
cause why they have not been
worked, at the September term
of county court. Some of the
roads have been neglected on ac
count of the proposed State Aid
improvement which was prom
ised by the Fiscal Court before
the bonds were voted. The peo
ple in general are up in arms
about having to pay 45 cents road
tax and still have to work the
road like they used to have to do
when no road tax was collected
at all. Some of the hands have
declared they will either pay the
tax or work the road, but they
positively will not do both.

tucky pensioners, the majority
of them veterans who fought iu
the Federal army in the war be
tween the States, died duritfg the
last fiscal year, according to the
report issued by the Commission
er of Pensions. His statement
shows that on June 30, 1015, there
were 10,431 Kentucky soldiers on
the rolls, who received 4,313,891
iu pensions this year. On July

Get Store in. Oil Fields.
Geo. W. Bush and Joe Clark
have purchased the general mer
chandise business of W. P. vWise
at Union Hall, which is in the
midst of the rich oil fields. This
business has grown phenominally
since drilling iu this section be
gau and Mr. Wise became tired
out. Besides his oil royalty is
sufficient to yield largo enough
income for him to retire from
active business and take a much
ueeded rest.
Wet Weather and Corn.
The continued wet weather has
caused a great deal of tho corn in
tho wet bottoms to fall to the
ground owing to a watery stalk
and the soft condition of the
ground. While the high water
has uot hurt much of the crop,
the effect of so much moisture
has been bad. Hillside corn is
maturing a very fine crop, but
the fields havo been badly
washed.

"The Good Samaritan Hospital."
There is a false impression
among many persons who hold a
dread for the hospital on account
of the neglect of attention they
are purported to hold for pa
tients. I desire to coirect this
impression, so far as has been
my experience, for truly could
no one bo better treated than I
was at the Good. Samaritan Hos
pital at Lexington during an op.
eratiou aud tho attention. follow
ing. I desiro to extend to tho
following persous connected with
my treatment my sincerest
thanks for their liberal and lov
ing attention :
Dr. Barkloy, operating; Dr.
Herring, assistant; Miss Wood
ruff, Supt.; Miss Watson, Asst.
Supt. ; Misses Hill, Morgau, Jones,
Gastiueau, and O'Neil. In
ternes, Drs. Itandall and Par
rigin. Truly has this hospital been
given the correct name "Good
Samaritan." F. G. Coulee.
