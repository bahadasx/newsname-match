Washington, Aug. 21.—A hearing of
great importance to farmers, farm or
ganizations and cities of North Dako
ta will be conducted by the newly ap
pointed federal farm loan board in the
federal building at Fargo on Friday,
Sept. 1. This hearing is to secure infor
mation to guide the board in deter
mining the boundaries of the 12 federal
land bank districts into which the
United States is to be divided for the
application of the new rural credits
legislation.
The members of the federal farm
loan board who will conduct the hear
ing are Hon. Wm. G. McAdoo, secre
tary of the treasury Geo. W. Norris,
farm loan commissioner Herbert
Quick, Capt. W. S. A. Smith and C. E.
Lobdell.
The board has requested farmers
and farm organizations of North Da
kota to furnish facts concerning the
need of cheaper farm loans and it has
asked interested cities to present
claims for the location of one of these
banks. This will be the only hearing
in North Dakota.
The new federal farm loan act will
do for the farmer what the federal re
serve act is doing for the business
man. Under it the government pro
vides the machinery for assembling
capital to be loaned to farm owners
or intended farm owners, on first
mortgage farm security. The loans
cannot exceed 50 per cent of the value
of the land, nor 20 per cent of the
value of the permanent improvements.
The loans will be made at a low rate
of interest, not yet determined, but
not over six per cent, and'provision is
made for the borrower to pay off the
loan and interest in small annual or
semi-annual payments through a per
iod of 40 years or less at Ms option.
Farmers, to take advantage of the law,
must associate themselves in groups
of ten or more and form farm loan
associations and then make applica
tion to one of the 12 federal "land
banks. The land will then be apprais
ed and, if it meets requirements, the
loans will be made.
The new legislation is expected to
yrove a great boon to those sections
of the country where development has
been arrested because of high inter
est rates and it is predicted that it
will have the effect of making agri
cultural prosperity permanent and un
iform stabilizing land values, and
greatly improving general farm con
ditions.
Thousands of requests to the U. S.
treasury department for information
regarding the application of the law
indicate the great, nation-wide inter
est in its provisions.
Secretary McAdoo predicts that the
banks will be ready for operation by
Jan. 1 or shortly thereafter.
Wholesale Trade Is
Ahead of Year Ago
Early reports that business in the
northwest this fall and winter will
continue excellent despite the failure
of the wheat crop seems fully borne
out by later investigation. This em
phasizes anew the fact that the north
west is nof a one-crop section, but that
big yields of corn, barley, oats, hay
and other farm products, together with
the proceeds from dairy herds and the
sale of live stock easily can make up
the loss in wheat.
In discussing the situation this week
Eradstreet's says:
"Activity prevails in all lines of
wholesale trade. Dealers in hardware
report their business for the week of
greater volume than during the corre
sponding week last year. Wholesale
dealers in general merchandise are en
joying an excellent house trade. Cata
log houses report a business better
than last year. The drug trade has
heen very satisfactory during the past
week. Fall orders in all lines are
reported heavy. Retail trade is active.
Country collections are good, and few
er requests for extensions are noted
than in previous years at this time.
"The threshing of wheat is well un
der way in many places and some re
ports indicate that the yield will be a
little larger than has been expected.
Where the wheat still is uncut the cool
weather of the past week has to some
extent checked damage by rust. Corn
is doing very well, and indications
point to a very large crop. The wea
ther has also been favorable for pas
tures and truck gardens."
Asks for Information
Regarding Creameries
E. A. Greenwood, state dairy com
missioner, has sent a letter to all the
buttermakers of the state asking
them to tell their troubles to the de
partment in order that it may be able
to better help them.
Mr. Greenwood enclosed in the let
ter a pamphlet covering a modern
bookkeeping system. He also called
attention to the fact that each churn
ing should be. tested for moisture to
insure that there isn't an excess of
moisture in the butter.

LABORER HAS LEG CAUGHT IN
SICKLE BAR AT CARRINGTON
Carrington, Aug. 19. Frank Gra
ham, who has been working for
Dickerson brothers, northeast of here,
had his left leg badly cut in the sickle
bar of a binder this week. The mus
cles of the leg were cut through to the
bone, just above the ankle..
Fargo Club Offers
Corn Show Prizes
The Commercial club of Fargo, rec
ognizing the fact that this year of all
years "corn is king," and that the pro
motion of the corn industry in North
Dakota is essential to the agricultural
interests of the state, has concluded
to offer prizes for the first best and
second best ten ears of corn exhibited
at any and every corn show held in
the state of North Dakota, the first
prize being $3, second prize $2. These
are offered contingent on the fact
fact that the winners send in their ex
hibit to the Fargo Commercial club to
be exhibited during the Tri-State con
vention in January, the club agreeing
to pay transportation charges on
same. Grand sweepstake prizes will
be offered at this convention for the
first and second best ten ears of the
entire group, first prize being $15, sec
ond prize $10.
Wheat Is Still Going Up
Cash wheat on the Minneapolis mar
ket Monday sold for $1.64%, while at
Duluth it sold for $1.65. September
wheat in Minneapolis brought $1.60%.
Those who have wheat this year will
probably make as much as from the
average crop at the average price,
while those Barnes county farmers
who have good pieces can cash in and
retire.
TRANSIENT DOES
NOT BELIEVE HIM
Rugby, Aug/ 17—O. S. Orr had
trouble with a couple of transients.
He discovered them roosting in his
hay mow, and when he requested them
to be up and moving, they seemed in
clined to question his authority. Af
ter he had made it plain to them, how
ever, that he meant business and the
head of a valiant cop appeared up the
stairway they decided to move without
any further delay—and they did.
Mrs. E. M. Roberts and daughtes,
Elsie and Amy, were arrivals in the
city the latter part of last week, and
are visiting with the I. J. Moe and An
ton Hoiland families this week. They
have been visiting at the Moe home
in Sanborn, and stopped here for a
visit on their way home to Fargo.
They expect to remain here until the
end of the week.
Guards Caught
in Gulf Storm
Laredo, Texas, Aug. 19.—Consider
able property damage and great incon
venience to troops in the various na
tional guardsmen camps in the Laredo
district resulted from a tropical storm
which raged here from 6 p. m. yester
day until 4 a. m. today. For several
hours Laredo was completely cut off
from wire communication.
Practically every tent of the 9,000
soldiers here was blown down and the
men were exposed to torrential rains
for hours.
Although damage along the beach
front is extensive, Corpus Christi pass
ironi is extensive corpus pdss- the
ed through the brunt of the tropica*
storm without a fatality in the city it
self, without serious injury to any per
son, and without serious property dam
age to the business section.
One section of the city is under
three feet of water. Scores of summer
cottages were washed away.
Several persons caught out in the
bay at Corpus Christi as well as other
sections are reported drowned, but no
bodies have been recovered and no
exact estimate can be made.
No loss of life has been reported in
the Laredo, district. Principal damage
here was confined to blowing down of
trees, fences and small buildings. The
maximum velocity of the wind was
60 miles an hour. The storm abated
suddenly.
Advices from the target range eight
miles southwest of Laredo, where
1,200 members of the First Missouri
infantry are at practice, state 600 shel
ter tents were blown down and the
men compelled to huddle together in
the open to weather the storm.
Spirits of Men Good
San Antonio, Aug. 19.—A wireless
to Fort Sam Houston tonight from
Gen. James Parker at Brownsville
said that the total damage to national
guard camps in that district will not
exceed $5,000 to $10,000. General
Parker said that the spirit of the men
was good and that practically all of
the tents were in position again.

Farmers of Northwest
Are in Excellent Shape
Minneapolis, Aug. 21.—Quoting gov
ernment figures covering conditions in
North and South Dakota, Montana arid
Wyoming for a number of years back,
A. E. Chamberlain, formerly of the ex
tension department of the Internation
al Harvester company and for many
years prominent in South Dakota agri
cultural and business affairs, told a
group of Minneapolis business men
that regardless of a small wheat crop,
the farmers of the northwest will be
in excellent financial condition until
time for the 1917 harvest.
Mr. Chamberlain, who now is head
of the extension department of the
North Dakota Farmer, published at
Aberdeen, S. D., spoke at the Minne
apolis Athletic club yesterday after
noon following a luncheon given by
the publishing company.
Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that
none of the reports of wheat crop fail
ure mention the fine crops in other
grains, notably rye, flax and corn, nor
hug
year
stock of wheat from last
»s bumper crop which the farmers
are holding in their granaries. He al
so laid great stress on the great in
crease in value of the dairy products,
the livestock, poultry, hay crop and
bank deposits. His total argument
disclosed that the farmers of the:
northwest states would go into the
winter with a surplus of nearly $60,
000,000.
BARN IS DESTROYED BY
FIRE OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN
Granville, Aug. 19.—Fire of un
known origin destroyed the barn on
the farm south of town, where Earl
Chaney and family reside. The place
is owned by Ed. Kemp. The conflag
ration occurred at about 6 o'clock
in the evening and as far as is known
no one had been inside or near the
barn since noon. The children were
spending the day at the home of
neighbors and Mrs. Chaney was sick
in bed, while Mr. Chaney and his hir
ed man were working in the field.
Luckily no stock was inside at the
time. Mr. Chaney lost some of his
harness and his hired man is minus
some clothing as well as $7 in cash
which was in one of his pockets.
Mrs. G. M. Tamke, of Sanish, was
among the out-of-town callers on Mon
day, stopping at the Kindred while in
the city.

IMIIIlllllllllllll
PLEASURE AND PROFIT
Deputy State Game Warden Burnie
Maurek, on information that the game
law was being continually violated,
went to Leal Sunday and in- that vicin
ity came in contact with Robert
Christ and Ed Kuergon, who were
hunting ducks, and Rudolph and H. J.
Holm, two boys who were carrying the
game.
When the game warden appeared
John Christ also got into the melee
by resisting the officer.
Complaint was made before Judge
Moe here and warrants were issued to
Sheriff Kelly, who went out and
brought in the parties.
Upon consultation after arriving
here and appearing before the magis
trate Robert Christ and Ed Kuergon
plead guilty to violating the game law
and John Christ plead guilty to resist
ing an officer.
For killing one duck Robert Christ
paid $43.70.
For killing three ducks Ed Kuergon
paid $93.70.
For resisting an officer John Christ
paid $50.00.
The case against the Holm boys was
dismissed because their part in the
case was merely acting as innocent
parties, although carrying the game
and therefore technically guilty of vio
lating the law.
Justice Moe made it clear to the of
fenders that violators of the laws
would be prosecuted and dealt with
according to their offense and without
fear or favor. This instance should
be sufficient warning to any others
that if apprehended they will be sum
marily dealt with for every infraction
of the game laws.
Barnes County Has Many
School Children Enrolled
Each year the school census of the
state is made by counties. All boys
and girls between the ages of six and
20, inclusive, are enumerated in this
cen8USi
gon
County Superintendent Niel-
^ag compiled the census from the
various districts of Barnes county for
1916, and reports a total of 5,525 per
sons of school age, of which 2,838 are
boys and 2,686 are girls. This is an
increase of 263 children over last
year's census.
Valley City has 632 boys and 632
girls, making a total of 1,264 children,
this being an unusual fact of an even
number of boys and girls.
The state and county tuition funds
are apportioned upon this enumera
tion. Last year each school clild
brought to his district $11.82. The
state fund comes from the fines and
penalties, interest and income of
school lands and the county fund from
the school poll and two-mill tax.
N. J. Olson, of the N. J. Olson &
Sons Elevator Co., was in the City on
Tuesday, coming in from Minneapolis
en route to his home at Sanborn. He
was registered at the Kindred between
trains.
R. J. Hannah was registered at the
Hotel Kindred from Oakes on Mon
day.

gleton of Oakes.
This is King's second recapture this
summer, being recaptured July 15.
King is serving a five-year term for
grand larceny. His term will be ex

Removal Petition
on November Ballot
The capital removal issue will find
a place on the ballots that will be
printed shortly, if the supreme court
fails to make a decision on the con
test involving the proposed amend
ment prior to the time the ballots are
printed.
Valley City Officers

It is announced from Bismarck that
a decision in the New Rockford-Bis
marck controversy, involving the legal
ity of the proceedings that have so
far been taken to place the removal
on the (ballot, will be forthcoming in
a short time.
Secretary of State Thomas Hall,
however, will print the proposed
amendment, on the official ballots as
usual, unless a court decision restrains
him from so doing—there being no
temporary injunction order.
Should a subsequent court decision
hold against New Rockford, it would
be necessary to print new ballots, pre
vent the distribution of ballots that
may already be prepared, or file an or

meeting and conducting a determined
campaign against I. W. W.'s, who have
been coming into this city in great
numbers during the past few days, offi
cials believe they have the situation
in hand, and that no serious trouble
will occur.
I. W. W.'s have been flocking here
since being ousted at Aberdeen, S. D.,
and Mott and New England, this state.
Boys Learn Mexican
From Boot Blacks
Mercedes, Tex. Aug. 19.—Cactus
may become as familiar as cabbage to
the Bismarck soldiers, palms may
create no more interest than hickory
trees, but the principal product of the
border—Mexicans—seems just as fas
cinating to the North Dakotans today
as the day of their arrival at Mercedes.
The Mexican children are a source
of never-failing amusement. They
swarm everywhere. Some of their
elders, especially the old men and
women, do not cross the railroad
track into the American part of town
once a week. But the youngsters
dart across the "international line" at
break of day and spend most of the
day with the Americans.
Morning mess is hardly over when
swarms of little brown bootblacks in
vade the North Dakota regiment, eag
er to polish boots and puttees.
A five-cent shine is a bargain be
cause it includes a lesson in Spanish.
Several of the Bismarck men make it
a point to learn at least ten new Mexi
can words with every shine. Before
their boots wear out they expect to
be masters of the language.
Critical students say the Spanish
spoken at Mercedes is far from pure.
But little is pure in this day of adult
eration, and one may as well take his
Spanish, like his granulated sugar, as
it comes and digest it as best he can.
These bootblacks are born gamb
lers, apparently. I saw an officer
give one of them a dime yesterday.
First the youngster split it with an
older boy who, it seems, owned the
shine box with which he did business.
Then the bootblack made a bee-line
to the only gambling hall in Mercedes
a soda fountain containing a nickle
in-the-slot machine which at times
yields 20, 16, eight, four and two trade
checks and at others nothing. The
youngster shrieked news of what he
intended to do as he dashed through
the street and a score of boys follow
ed the plunger. He dropped the nickle
in the slot and shot the lever and thd
circle of on-lookers, chattering
monkeys, became silent while fate
cided whether the gamester should"
win. Twenty checks gurgled out of
the brass throat of the machine and a
roar like a budding revolution went
up. Swift runners darted across the
railroad track to spread the good
news of the gambler's 'killing"
through the Mexican quarter and sum
mon his relatives to the hall of good
fortune.
With his hat cocked on one side of
his head and his eyes dancing, the boy
fed all the checks into the craw of
the machine, shrugged his shoulders,
and swaggered smiling out on the
sidewalk to hunt' another shinfe cus
tomer.
The Time*-Record's phone it No. 4.
In a letter to the Fargo Forum, dat
ed at Mercedes, Tex., Aug. 14, W. A.
Stickley tells of a trip which a few of
the officers of the First North Dakota
regiment took the preceding Sunday
and of a native meal they enjoyed (?).
Mr. Stickley says:
"The regiment has a large automo
bile truck which is in charge of Cap
tain Angus Fraser. On Sunday Fra
.ser decided to take several officers out
for a joy ride down on the Rio Grande.
The party was made up of the follow
ing officers: Captain Fraser, of Far
go Captain Ritchie, of Valley City
Major Henry, of Bismarck Captain
Eckman, of Grand Forks Lieutenant
Muliclc, of Bismarck Lieutenant Ross,
of Valley City and Lieutenant Colley, of
Fargo. The roads were muddy, but
owing to the fact that Chauffeur Oli
ver Conn, who used to drive for Mau
rice Kaufman, enjoyed a reputation of
always being able to come back, no
such thing as fear of being stuck en
tered the minds of the party. All
went well till near Progreso, where
the road became very bad. Conn plow
ed through bravely but suddenly the
bottom dropped out of the road and
the machine stood in mud and water
up to the box. It was fully a mile to
Progreso, and the way was through
cactus and mesquite. A messenger
was secured and dispatched to camp
asking for relief.
"The machine was pulled out but
was so wet it would not run and was
left beside the road to dry, while we
went to look for something to eat.
Major Henry and Captain Fraser,
whose vocabulary of Spanish had been
sadly neglected since their service in
the Philippines, attempted to secure
a meal for the gang at the home of a
greaser. Captain Fraser prefaced his
attempt by offering the greaser a cig
aret and quoting the Spanish adver
tisement on a package of Bull Durhum
which he had committed to memory.
"After much deaf and dumb lan
guage and many attempts at ordering
supper we succeeded in getting the
women busy in preparing the meal. A
little table was prepared in the yard
near the bamboo and straw hut. Fancy
flowered dishes were placed on the
table and we sat down for the feast.
The chicken was fried in about a gal
lon of the greasiest grease I ever en
countered. There was a plate of rice
fried in garlic. Some flat cakes made
of (as near as we could figure) corn
cob meal and some sole-leather cheese
which was just as strong in smell as
it was in fibre. I watched a part of
the preparation of the meal and al
most had heart failure when the wom
an began baking the little flat cakes
which were apart of our meal. She per
pared a wooden bowl of dough which
she placed on the floor beside the mud
oven, and sat down beside it. Pinch
ing off a piece of dough she raised
her skirt and patted the cake to the
thickness and size she wanted it on
her leg above the knee. I almost ex
ploded as the reality of the joke dawn
ed upon me. I tipped it off to Lieu
tenant Dan Mulick, who kept the se
cret until after the boys had enjoyed
the new bread, but they came near
leaving us in the jungles for not ad
vising them sooner. Colley condem
ned the whole meal as not complying
with the pure food regulations.
"But to return to my story, where
we sat down to the table with fancy
flowered dishes. We asked for knives,
forks and spoons, and were informed
that they had none, hence we ate with
our fingers. The coffee was good, and
the water was fine, but the rest of it
was judged according to the delicacy
of each man's taste.
"The meal over, we began to fish
around for money and were able to
dig up $4 for the 11 suppers. The
greaser and family almost fainted at
the sight of so much money and bid
us many fond adieux as we left."
KINTYRE CHILD SWALLOWS Pll*
Frankie Davis, the young daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. F. E. Davis, of Kin
tyre, who swallowed a pin one day
last week was taken to Bismarck, but
the doctors there were unable to do
anything for her and she was taken,
to St. Paul. It is reported that the pin
is lodged in a bronchial tube and
stuck in her left lung near the heart.
One operation has been performed, but
the doctors failed to remove the pin
and plan to operate again.
Head Is Cut by Horse's Hoof
LaMoure, Aug. 18.—Ludwig Chris-,
tianson, employed on the Edwin Elli
son farm, was fortunate to escape with
his life Monday morning when a
•horse he. was shoeing reared on its
thfej hind feet and came down with its
lik$^rom*ho,ofs on his head. Christianson
W&s "ffli$Bg, the shoe on the front foot
of the anithal and had difficulty with
the animal, as it was fractious. As
he held the animal's foot between his
knees and reaching for nails, the
horse reared. The boy, overbalanced,
attempted to stagger from beneath the
animal's hoofs when it came down, but
was unable to do so in time. One of
the calks on the foot that had been
shod struck him over the right eye, in
flicting a deep gash and temporarily
dazing the young man.
Though quite painful, the injury was if
found not to be necessarily serious.:
Had the calk struck half an inch high
er, the physician said, the injury
would have proved fatal, or if it half
been an inch lower it would have re-4
suited in the logs of his eye.
