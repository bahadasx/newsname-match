Inasmuch as a story is being

W. I. Burk of Alpine arrived
in the city yesterday and is now
shaking hands with the voters
here. Will is out for County
Assessor.
Royally Entertained.
Editor St Johns Herald.
St. Johns, Arizona.
Dear Sir:
Will you -indly give space in
your valuable paper for the fol
lowing few lines, as I feel that
they are worthy of mention:
On the 18th of this month I had
the pleasure of meeting with the
good people of Luna, Alpine and
Nutrioso in their Old Folks social
gathering and to say that it was
a complete success is putting it
mildly. I have attended a num
ber of such gatherings but never
attended one that was better; it
seemed that everyone present,
both old and young, partook of
the spiritof the occasion.
Great credit is due the com
mittee that had it in charge for
the systematic way in which they
handled it there is also great
credit due the; young people for
the pleasant manner and way they
had in entertaining the honored
guests.
A very interesting program
was gotten up for the occasion
consistiugof songs, recitations,
speeches and instrumental music,
which was rendered at the
morning session.
At noon the guests sat down to
a bounteous feast prepared by
loving and thoughtful hands and
one that could not be surpassed
anywhere.- AtJ2 o'clock we all
assembled again and was enter
tained b y an extemporaneous
program which was very inter
esting and enjoyable.
In the evening agrand ball was
given at which the Old Folks had
the right of way until they be
came weary after which the
voung folks had a. jolly time un
til after midnight. It would have
done you good to have seen the
m-Av "haired men and women go
ing through some of the old time
reels and square dances. Many
of the young people looked on in
astonishment, and wnen uncie
Nute Adair and Aunt Francis
Mangum took the floor and gave
us an old time jig dance they
brought the whole house down.
I hardly think you could find
their equal in the county, old or
young. AuntFrancis stepped to
thenmsicand was as light on her
feet as a sixteen year old girl.
Jam looking forward to the
time when I may again have the
pleasnre of again meeting with
the e-ood rjeoDle of those mountain
settlements on a similar occasion.
Respectfully,
W. H. Gibbons.
A Word to the Voters.
1 am informed that someone
has been industriously engaged
in circulating the report that m
case I am elected to the office of
sheriff an understanding exists
whereby Jacob Hamblin, the
present incumbent of the office,
and Deputy Co'nnor Trammel
will become my deputies. I wish
to emphatically deny that there
has been or is any such under
standing. If I am elected neither
Mr. Hamblin nor Mr. Trammel
will serve under me as deputies.
Furthermore, I wish to state that
have promised no one a position
as deputy. If elected, will do
what is fair and just to the best
of mv ability, but I have no
special pets and ain not, offering
any special inducements in tne
line-of deputyship to.gain votes.

William Rothlisberger Killed.
Willie, son of Mr. and Mrs. Fred
Rothlisberger, met with a fatal
accident last Thursday evening
at about 6 o'clock. Willie had
been visiting at the home of his
aunt, Mrs. Fred Neilson, atRich
ville. He left his aunt's home
Thursday morning going to the
Stradling ranch a few miles dis
tance with the intention of
coming home with Mrs. Stradling
who was coming to St. Johns the
next day. While at the Stradling
ranch he spent the day with the
children there playingin one way
and another. In the evening
Mrs. Stradling told her little son,
Clifford to go and get the cows
from the pasture.
Clifford left accompanied by
Willie, to get the cows, when a
short distance from the house
they caught a horse to ride the
balance of the distance, the horse
was one that Clifford always
rode for cows, while trying to
put the briddle on the horse it
became frightend in some way
and the rope which was lying on
was in some way wrapped around
Willie's feet he was jerked vio
lently to the ground and dragged
about 40 yards. The Stradling
boy upon discovering that his
companion was seriously hurt ran
for help meeting his mother, who
had witnessed the scene from the
house and was running to the
boy.""" Mrs. Stradling picked
Willie up and carried him to the
house where ' she tried every
available means to revive him,
but all to no purpose as later ex
aminations showed that his neck
had been broken.
Robt. Overson who had been
working near the Stradling ranch
happened to be going by and was
met by Thomas Irwin's son
Johnny who told what had
happened and Mr Overson know
ing that Mrs. Stradling was all
alone onN the ranch with her
children went to the rescue and
brought the body to St Johns.
Willie was a bright manly little
fellow and is well known here in
St. Johns. The sorrow of his
parents is almost inconsolable.
They have the sympathy of the
entire community.
Funeral services were held
Friday afternoon at the academy
and burial took place at the
Westside cemetery.
