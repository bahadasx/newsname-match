HUGHES FACES
MOOSER RtVOLT
Leading Progressive Organ
Says Candidate Denounced
by G. 0. P.
LINKED WITH OLD GUARD.
Admits Strong Wilson Senti
ment Is Found Wherever
Mooser Sentiment Is.
New York, Aug. 22. Both in its
news columns and editorially, The
Philadelphia North American, the
leading progressive newspaper in the
East, a recognized Roosevelt organ
and up to the present a supporter of
Mr. Hughes, in today's issue makes
the unqualified statement that the re
publican candidate isfacinga nation
wide progressive revolt."
Its special dispatch from San Fran
cisco declares that Chester Rowel!,
progressive leader and member of
the republican national campaign
committee, has denounced the repub
licans candidate for "abandoning the
progressives of California for the old
guard wolves."
The North American, commenting
upon Mr. Rowell's denunciation,
says:
"It points to an impending progres
sive war on the candidate which may
easily react' on the situation in every
state in the union, especially in the
doubtful states."
The article emphasizes the declara
tion oJMr. Hughes in his San Fran
cisco Speech that he. came to Cali-
forniaTas "sDokesmanrof the national
republican party.
"Mr. Huehes mfcht better
have
said nothing at allj" continues the dis
patch, which would have been a
wiser course than to ignore the plans
of the progressives."
HAS SPILLED THE BEANS.
"He has spilled the beans," the
editorial in the North American upon
the progressive situation is headed.
It says in part: "Mr. Hughes letter
of acceptance left much to be desired.
As the present making campaign, not
even his most ardent admirers will
assert that up to this time he has con
vinced the waiting public that he pos
sesses exceptional strength."
After reviewing the outlook; the
editorial adds significantly: "One
condition however, is definite and ob
vious the progressive strength has
not swung entirely over to Hughes
despite the confident prediction that
CoL Roosevelt's wholehearted en
dorsement would have that result.
Neither lias the decision of the pro
gressives to abandon the party organ
ization for this year produced that
effect "
"It would be absurd to belittle the
defection of such men as John M
Parker of Louisiana, Judge Lindsey
of Colorado; Francis J. Heney of
California; Matthew Hale of Massa
chusetts, Edwin H. Lee of Indiana;
G. A.H. Hopkins of New Jersey,
Judge Norton, pf Missouri; Bain
bridge Colby of New York and Hen
ry M. Wallace."
.NOT MERELY HUGHES' OPPOS1-
SITION.
The editorial points that the pro
gressive vote which will go to Wilson
will not represent merely opposition
to Hughes.
J3eferring to President Wilson the
editorial continues "Wherever one
dips in the progressive vote a strong
Wilson sentiment is found. Another
ominous fact is that Mr. Wilson is able
to do things while Mr. Hughes can
only criticize and promise."
"G. 0. P. IS HATEFUL

TO COST $30,000 COMPLETE
Warned m Honor ot a Color-
ed Hero of The
Revolution.
Work on the Attucks Colored High
School has been hurried up this week
in order that the building may be
completed by October, at which time
the pupils are expected to move in.
The building is one of the best planned
school buildings in the State. It is a
two-story brick building covering a
space of a little over one hundred
feet square. The work on the build
ing will cost in the neighborhood of
$22,000.
By the sagacious management of
the School Board and the builders of
the school, the structure has been
raised for a sum much less than it
would ordinarily have cost. The
economical program by which a large
amount, perhaps four thousand dol-
ilars, was saved, was by using the old
.stone and some of the brick and wood
from tbeold Clay Street School The
stone was in excellent condition and
the windew slabs and places -where
polished stone is utei, wereanade of
the stone that had been in the Clay
Street School building, without any
more work on the stone Being need
ed.
The building was named in honor
of Crispus Attucks, the mulatto lead
er who was killed in the Boston mas
sacre. A big stone on the left of the
door bears the name of the school in
iarge letters.
The school is es)ccially cell cared
for in the way of an auditorium and
gymnasium. 1 lie auditorium is a
largo hall, capable of seating two or
three hundred people. It is equipped
with a stage and will be splendidly
lighted and fitted up. The audito
rium will be used for a study hall.
Desks will be put in for nearly two
hundred pupils. All grades from the
sixth up will be put in the High
School.
The gymnasium lias a long floor
with three'tiers of seats in the galle-
-
training room and domestic science
(room, which will liave complete

TIDE OF BATTLE WAVERS
Paris Reports Important Gams
at Entrance of the Great
Vardar Valley.
London. Aug. 23. Both allied
wings of the Saloniki front where the
soldiers of at least seven nations are
in battle have been bent back by the
Bulgarians. In the center, however,
where the allies' main effort is being
made at the entrance to the great Var
dar valley, Paris reports important
gains.
On the western front there has
been little change. The British con
tinue their efforts to surround Thiep
val and report the capture of 100
yards of German trenches in the di
rection of Martinpuinch.
There has been no action of impor
tance on the French section.
Russians have arrived in Saloniki
to fight with tho entente forces.
Landing of Italian troops, who are
also to take part in the Balkan oper
ations, is continuing. An, unofficial
dispatch also reports that Greek
troops have been engaged with Bul
garians in the vicinity of Seres.
There is no news from the Italian
front, where a lull has existed for sev

Shnw Fnr
Many Entries.
Tiie Automobile Show Friday night
is the only night attraction at the Pen
nyroyal Fair this year, and with the
Fair Hop at Hotel Latham following,
will be the big society event of the
Fair. It will be "dress up" night for
both the automobiles and their occu
pants and the people who will throng
into the grand stand and watch the
contests to select the best looking
cars.
The automobile contests are better
selected this year than they have been.
They are divided so that every car in
the county will be given an opportun
ity to compete against the other cars.
Ben McReynolds, chairman of the
committee on Automobile night, will
have charge of the auto parade and
contests. The judges of the show
have not been selected, but a fair
party of enthusiasts will form the
refereeing committee.
Invitations have been issued to all
the nearby towns and it is expected
that a large number of cars from
other cities will be in the show. Pa
ducah, Madisonville, Clarksville and
Nashville are expected to be well
represented in the rings.
The prizes offered are tempting
enough to tempt any automobile own
er to appear on the scene and display
mo nil .
A special feature of this year's pro
gram is the presence of a ten dollar
prize for tho best decorated Ford.
The "Lizzie" cannot be left out and
the prizes for cars of certain sizes and
