Summer Dress Goods
IT IS NOT our policy to have cut price sales. The suc
cess of our Dress Goods Department has been due to the
fact that we have always carried a conservative stock of
the very newest and neatest patterns of seasonable mer
chandise. However, IT IS our policy to CLEAN UP on
our Dress Goods at the end of each season, so that we can
start the next season with a nice, fresh stock of goods
for that reason we are offering some Wonderful Bargains
in Summer Dress Goods. '

Telling You About An
Implement Worth Owning
LJAVE you ever thought of increasing your crop
yield by planting with a Kentucky drill? It can
be done.
Kentucky drilled grain stands a better chance of pro
ducing a bumper crop than broadcasted seed. It takes less
seed too, and will do a much butler job in a wet field than a
seeder. Grain put in with n Kentucky drill will all come up
at the same time and all ripen at once. This is an advantage
that cannot be expected from seed broadcasted.
The Kentucky lilit diuft rain drills hove bren largely responsible for
the big crop yirlds in tin Ked Uiver Valley and other celebrated wheat
dibtncts. Without the Kentucky drill those farmers would hnvo no better
crop than you. Call in norne day
