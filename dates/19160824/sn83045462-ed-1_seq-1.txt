Berlin View of Situation.
"The prevailing opinion in political
circles in Berlin regarding the operation
against Gen. Sa Trail's forces in
Macedonia." says the semi-official Overseas
News Agency today, "may be con

movement is an 'offensive defense.'
"As a matter of fart." adds the news
agency. "(Jen. Sarrail's army has been
shelling for months Bulgarian villages
and lands where Bulgarian crops were
growing, and the only means to bring
, about a change was to drive this army
from its position. Therefore the present
operation is directed not against
the sovereignty and territorial rights
of <Jreece. hut rather to defend them
against Gen. Sarrail, who was continuously
violating these territorial
rights by making Greek soil a base for

LONDON, August 24, 3:25 p.m.?On

Fleury and Thiaucourt which
had been taken by the French were
violently shelled by the German guns.

Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania, r
suming his attack on the emergen'
revenue bill in_ the Senate today, pa
ticularly criticised the proposed tax <
manufacturers of munitiohs, which
said yesterday was of doubtful lega
ity. The senator declared that the pr
posal is sectional and unfair becau
all munitions are not included in ti
tax.
"The munitions referred to in the b

Profits Not Always Large.
"The tax, I suppose, is levied on m
nitiens on the theory that enormo
profits are being made. A tax on gro
receipts finds some precedent in legi

say that a large majority of the ma
ufacturers who went into the muriitio
business have not fared well; inai
have gone into bankruptcy: many mo
have made no money at all: some ha
made a fair profit; and, of course,
very few have made good profits.
Tariff Law Debated.
A defense of the existing democra
tariff law by Senator I'nderwood
Alabama, one of the authors of th
law, and an attack upon the dem
cratic tariff and the pending reven
bill by Senator Penrose of Penns:
vania featured the debate on the re
enue bill In the Senate yesterday aft*
noon.
Senator I'nderwood approved t
pending revenue bill in the main, h
diri not concur in the recommendatio
for a tariff commission and for i
creased duties on dyestuffs.
The revenue bill. Senator Underwo
said, was necessitated by demands
the wealth of the country for milita
preparedness.
"The burden of this proposed tax,"
said, "is distributed to the wealth
the country. It is not a tax on co
sumptldn, where the burden falls
the masses."
Senator Penrose said:
"We are drifting to a system of dirt
taxes at a time when nearly eve
civilized nation is going in the oth
direction. Before the outbreak of t
war in Europe every nation in Euro]
except England, had a protective tari

It is the belief of the republican

the accentuation of the division between

alienate progressive votes from the re- m,

No safe opinion can be passed upon ra
that point until after next Tuesday's
primaries, which will decide the contest m
