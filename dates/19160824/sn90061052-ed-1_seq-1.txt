THE ASPER hlGH SCHOOL
Opens September 4 Superin
tendent Willftp Invites Rural
Purils and -Parents to
Call on Him
The Jasper schools will open Monday
September 4 The following teachers
have been employed In the hlnhschool
department FC Wlklnssuperintchd
cnt Everett DeardoriT principal Miss
Bess Bowcri teacher In the grades
department Miss Alma Heldner sev
enth and eighth Mhs Aretha Bulrd
fifth and sixth Miss Fay Utlra third
dnd fourth Mrs ArinJv Rex first and
second It is highly important that
every pupil be present qt the opening
exercises As farua possible it is
ominentlcd that every pupil supply
himself with all necessary equipment
before school begins If any are in
doubt they should consult their teach
er or the superintendent The sopho
mores will please note that Harding
New Mediaeval and Modern Hislorv
has been adopted for the ensuing ycui
instead of Myers Mediaeval and Mod
ern History whlcli was used last year
All indications point to a very suc
cessful school year No pains or ex
pense have beenSparca in securing tlit
very best teachers for every grado or
department Parents in the rural dis
tricts whose children have graduatcu
from the rural schools and who are con
templallng giving their -children
high school education will do well to
Investigate the Jasper High School
It is u first class four year high school
and ranks wellwatd the top of other
schools of the fixate of similar rating
Every boy or girl who has finished
the common school course is entitled
to a high school education Parentx
should take note of that fact Bad
crops or a slight money stringency
should not be allowed to interfere
One years delay to send a boy or girl
to high school when he or she is ready
to enter and is eager to enter is
dangerous It may men
revolution in the life of the boy or girl
It is a very familiar fact that when
boys and girls fall behind their elass
mates they are ashamed to enter school
A years delay may mean the falling
of your boy into bad habits of living
and among associates who may take
out of him allself respect and rob him
of any ambition or aspiration he ever
had of making a worthwhile citizen in
the world It is net enough to say
that an education would have been
wasted on such a fellow There ia
plenty of evidence to show that there
are many young men and young women
who are leading Uvea of shame and
misery whose degradation might have
been spared had they only been given
a fair chance toward an education when
they were younger and needed it and
even yearned for it Wc have all heard
children say that if they could not go
to school this year they would not go
next year
Another argument in favor of your
sending your boys and girls to school
is that society dcmands that they be
educated Society can never rise above
the general level of its average citizen
Only by raising this average can so
ciety rise In a commercial sense too
is the argument in favor of educating
your boys and girls as early as possible
This an age of keenest competition
The struggles for existence was never
so severe as now And the outlook for
the future promises no relief It is
only in proportion as we equip ourselves
for lifes struggle that wc are able to
overcome the obstacles against which
we are sure to fight and that will en
able us to take a place of honor and
position in the world
The superintendent is canvassing
the countryabout Jasper in an effort to
interest the parents of rural puplis in
the Jasper School and if he should
miss anyone who is interested he would
be glad to hac such parties call on
him whether parents or pupils and
would be pleased to give them all the
information and help possible

6ld Merry Optimist was in town
Monday handing out his jolly
smiles and llcarty handshakes says
the Butler Democrat Talk about
your drouths he said this little
dry spell is not a marker to what we
hadin 1871 or may be In 1875 Then
wo had real dry weather Itwasso
dry that we had to go down to the
river and geta drink before we could
spit on our hands nt hay harvest
time But we lived and thrived
and as many babies were born that
year as ever before Wc hud plenty
of sow bosom and beans cornbread
and buttermilk and it was no un
common thing to have hot biscuit
and pie for our Sunday dinners
Say boys Ive been llvln In Mis
souri for nigh on 70 years and I
have yet to see the time when any
body starved to death if he was
willing to work Talk about hard
times They haint no sich thing
We live in the best state in the best
country on earth and even if the
corn does look bad we got lots of
other things to be cheerful about
Smile durn it and the world will
look a blamed sight brighter
