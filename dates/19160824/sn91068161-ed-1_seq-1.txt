AN UNUSUAL EXPERIENCE.
Mr. D. Levi, a guest of the Carolina
Terrace from Sumter, S. C; a day or
two ago took a walk, and returning to
the hotel a shorter way, jumped over a
wire fence into a bunch of weeds. He
thought no more about the fence in
cident until he got on the hotel piazza
and took a seat. He felt something
crawling in one leg of his trousers.
He thought it was a mouse, and with
the female instinct he gathered the
unknown reptile in the folds of his
pantaloons and made a, bee line for
his room Jo investigate. It was a liz
zard. His lizzardship had pushed
himself all but the tail, into the lining
of the trousers and there he was
stuck. Mr. Levi, very calmly and
quietly took him by the tail and flung
the pants-leg intruder far out of the
window to pastures new. If it had
been a woman there is no doubt but
what there would have been some live
ly times around the Terrace, and the
guests would have known that some
thing unusual was happening. .
A WALKING EECOfiD.
Misses Blanch McKeever, of Wil
mington, Del., and Ethel Gilbert of
Ottanola think that they have made a
new record in walking from Sugar
Loaf Mountain t0 Hendersonville.
They made the trip Wednesday in ex
actly four hours.

ten months in the year instead of
eight, and to have the two last months
of the school year conducted here,
moving here in April of each year and
continuing the school until sometime

"Winners..
The dahlia show given on yesterday
afternoon under the auspices of the
Woman's Club was a success and everi
surpassed the expectapnQ of the ladies
both in exhibits and in the patronage.
This was the first show of its kind in
Hendersonville and so pleased were
the ladies with their initial effort
that it is now their intention to make
it an annual affair. The small admis-
sion of 10c was charged at the door
and iced tea and wafers, at a moderate
price, were served in a daintily ap-
pointed tea room and the sum of $35.00
was realized clear of all expenses.
ihe entry of dahlias from many sec- :
tions of the countv as well as from the
city was very large. And the ladies !
in charge Had arranged them most
tastefully in the two rooms devoted to :
the show. The ladies selected to act '

Mrsy Tom valentine. Mrs. M. A.
Brown, Mrs. A. M. Trenholm and Miss

Any number of visitors have ex
pressed their approval of the parking
of autos in the cent3r of Main street.
Some of the local merchants who were
at first skeptical have now admitted
that it was a wise move made by the
city council.
A wagon from the country was com
j ing up from the depot on Seventh ave-
nue vesterdav when it van into one of !
the holes in the pavement and slid
over against one of the rails of the
idle car track and went down with the
wheels in splinters. Several weeks
ag0 an auto was making a sharp turn
where Seventh avenue comes into
Main street and one of the front
wheels caught against the car line
track and was smashed to pieces. In
connection with the above it is said
that the city council is giving serious
thought to the condition of the West
side of Main street pavement.
Among the distinguished visitors in
the city this week from South Caroli
na is C. C. Featherstone. of Green
wood. Mr. Featherstone stopped over
here after attending the convention at
Lake Junaluska near Waynesville. He
has been coming to Hendersonville for
a number of seasons and is highly
pleased with the city.
'Mr. Featherstone came verv near be
ing governor of South Carolina when
he succeeded in getting in the second
race in .the primary with Former Gov
ernor Cole L. Blease. He is now a
prominent lawyer of Greenwood.
W. D. Bryan, of Taft, S. C, arrived
in the city with his family Monday.
He is well known here where he has
been coming every season -for a num
ber of years and is a large property
owner in Hendersonville. Mr. Bryan
states that his farmina- interests in
lower South Carolina will require his
time in a short while and that he will
not be able to spend as much time
here as usual. For two- years Mr.
Bryan was president of South Caroli
na state association, an organization
of this city.
"Hendersonville keeps -on growing,"
exclaimed Mr. Bryan in conversation
with the Hustler representative.
Howell Cobb, , owner of Carolina.
Terrace, says that he will keep his ho-
tel open well into the autumn and that
next year he proposed to remain open
the year Tound. Mr. Cobb is well
pleased with the season so far. He
has just completed his hotel which js
one or the most modern in Western
North Carolina. - 'Two crying needs of
Hendersonville are a city park and a
golf course," said Mr. Cobb. He told
f having any number ot inquiries this
season from people desiring to visit
Hendersonville and ston at his hotel
through the season provided they could
play golf here. He was forced to
write them that Hendersonville did not
have suitable links and they went to
Asheville.

lonely, is now alive with the enthusi
asm and energy of youth. Boys ani
girls are here from all. directions, iioz
only from different sections of Hen

Carolina, but from South Carolina as
well. Here and there can be seen
groups of old students 'comparing
notes" on the experience and pleasures
of the vacation season and at the same
time giving a hearty welcome to those
who are here for the first time. The
reSular work of the session will begin

things being the opportunity for greater

number of boys and girls who have
come to avaiT themselves of these oid-poj-tunities.
He also emphasized some
of the things for which the institution
stands. "Fruitland Institute," he said
"is a school-plus, and the greatest
thing is the plus." It does just as
good work as. any other school of the
land, ' and at, the some time its ideal
is the " development of great purposes

things. Professor Melton gave what he
deemed to be the only cure for "home

When the announcements for the

to the class room, to the athletic field,
visit them in their rooms and in their
society halls and in their duties in the

teachers and students working togeth

who will deliver special lectures dur
