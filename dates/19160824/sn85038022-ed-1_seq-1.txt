nor A. O. Stanley addreaaed delegates
from the counties of Boone, Bracken.
Campbell. Gallatin, Grant, Harrlaon,
Kenton, Mason and Owen to the 8ev
enth Tuberculosis Sanitarium district
meeting In Judge Tracy's court room
today. Harry B. Mackoy was chair
man and said that Kenton county has
accumulated about $19,000 for the es
tablishment of a tuberculosis sanitar
ium and that the State Tuberculosis
Commission wants the co-operation of
all the counties In the Seventh dis
trict Governor Stanley said In part:
"It la tho duty of the government
to see that diseases which decimate
society, which take away lives preci
ous to society are curtailed, control
led or prevented. Every man Is worth
according to statistics $1,500 to so
ciety. He ought to be worth many
thousands. It is as much the duty of
the government to rid these Instru
ments of death as to light hostile
armies.
"Tuberculosis Is as deadly as arr
the steal bullets fired by an invad
ing army. This matter of fighting
tuberculosis Is merely a matter of
business. One-seventh of the human
race Is dying from this disease.
"I want my Tuberculosis Commis
sion to be a commission with a pur
pose and common sense. I want tho
commission to stamp out dread dis
eases In this State. The commission
Is neither Democratic or Republican."
The Governor concluded his speech
with an earnest plea for the co-operation
of the delegates In the flght the
State Is making to wipe out tuber
culosis. Short addresses were delivered by
representatives from various counties
Luncheon was served In the law li
brary to the delegates at the noon ad
journment by Colonel Tom Cody.
At tho afternoon session resolutions
were presented, followed by discus
sions. At 4 o'clock the delegates took
an automobile trip through the county
to select a site for the proposed sana
torium. The site that will most probably be
selected Is situated on a hill just west
of Covington. From tho promontory
the cities of Cincinnati, Covington,
Newport and Fort Thomas are visible.
The site comprises ninety-seven acres
and is an Ideal spot, being very Iso
lated. It is to be hoped that the pro
posed sanitorlum will be a go.

HOUSE DRESSES
THAT ARE DIFFERENT
There are things that differentiate a store, make it better.
We "go in" for housedresses because we know they are im
portant. Our efforts have been concentrated on styles to sell
at two prices $1.25 and $1.50. The varieties are broad and
styles are very pretty.
There was a time when house dresses were all alike. Now
they are not only varied but really distinctive. At least that
is the sort of housedresses you will find here.
