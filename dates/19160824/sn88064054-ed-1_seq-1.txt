At I o'clock the orders to move ture
to town were given and it was a wor
heart breakinig sight to see the drip
troops marching througn the rain stat
wind and mud to find shelters. The mu
school houses, ware houses and wit]
buildings of every kind were thrown E
open to accumodate them. The to i
manvy handsome homes near the Sur
camps yere also thrown open and' me
their owners exerted themselves to Ph,
make the soldiers comfortable., bui
Telephone poles were blown down. pri

away and plate glass fronts of' the M1
business district broken. iThe worst
of the storm had passed before
night. which was a good thing as i
the electric wires were all down and
the town was in darkness.
We havn't had a train from the we
north since yesterday morning and an
several washouts up the line are th
reported.
The majority of the troops took nu
the storm and inconvenience good as

around here.
