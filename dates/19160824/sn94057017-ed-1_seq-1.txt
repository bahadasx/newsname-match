ABSTRACT OF ASSESSMENT TORRANCE COUNTY, 1915-1916
The tax schedules went more into detail this year than last, and there are other changes most
notably the shifting of a large acreage of land from the agricultural to the grazing classification, and
a considerable acreage from timber to grazing or agricultural. The table has been arranged as well
as possible for purposes of comparison. The increase this year over last year is $372,682.00, and the
total is $354,834.00 above the requirements of the state tax commission. Also it is sufficient to put
the county in the second class and raise the salaries of county officers.

Tom Cain left for Albuquerque
Monday, intending to go from j
there to Tyrone. If he finds em- j
ployment to suit, Mrs. Cain and
the baby will follow, with the in-1
tention of staying there during j
the fall and winter. Tom in- j
tends to come back in the spring
and join the bean raisers next
season.
W. L. Compton, who lives
southwest of Estancia, is one of
the farmers who never fail to
raise a crop, and of course he has
a good crop this year. He has
fifty-three acres of fine beans
and forty acres of good corn
some of it the best he ever raised.
Last August Mr. Compton
plowed some ground intending
to sow wheat, but it was too dry
in the fall and he planted the
ground to corn and beans, and
he says the crops on this cround
are decidedly better than on the
ground plowed in the spring.
J. N. Delhnger, who located
near Stanley aoout a year ago
ana planted a crop on ground
that had not been farmed for
several years, was eaten out by
tne cut worms, tie has moved
to the old Preston place west of
estancia and is looking around
tor a place to buy in this vicinity.
Mr. Dellinger comes from Okla
homa. He is not in the least
discouraged by his lack of suc
cess this season, and will buvand
remain here if he can find a deal
that suits him.
Reports from the foothills say
that the ladybird bean beetle is
damaging many fields of beans,
and a few have been found in
valley fields near the foothills.
It is not likely that this insect
can at this stage destroy many
fields, but it may damage many
of them heavily. So far the in
sect is confined almost entirely to
the fields of the native people in
the hills. County Agent Har
well has been up there for sev
eral days endeavoring to cet
those whose fiolds are beinsr rav
aged to club together and get
power sprayers, by which means
the insects can be exterminated,
but so far hasn't succeeded in
getting any of them to take hold.
Of course a hand sprayer will do
the business, but it is too slow
for field work. Mr. Harwell
thinks that in most cases the
ravages of this insect will not do
more than stop the growth of the
plant and thus prevent the
younger beans from maturing,
and that the bean pods now prac
tically mature will ripen, but it
is a pity to let them wo'k this
damage when it could be pre
vented.
Much rain is reported in the
vicinity of Encino and Duran
during the past week, but there
has been none at Estancia worth
mentioning, although there has
been rain in other parts of the
valley.
Mr. Staley of Progresso is one
of the unfortunate ones whom
the rains shied around this sea
son, but he is not one of the
faint hearted ones who quit when
the rains fail to come just at the
proper moment. He kept at
work, and last week harvested
three hundred pounds of beans
to the acre. Rain fell on the
field three or four days before
the beans were harvested when
they were fully ripe and ready to
harvest. The date of this rain
was ninety-three days after the
last previous rain on the field,
and from planting to ripening
there was not a drop of rain on
the field. This is a feat worth
talking about. And by the way,
we are told that Mr. Staley rais
es buckwheat every year, and
has good success with it. Con
ditions in this valley ought to be
very favorable to buckwheat.
A WORD FOR MOTHERS
It is a grave mistake for mothers to neg
lect their achea and pains and suffer la
silence this only leads to chronic sick
ness and often shortens life.
If your work is tiring; if your nerves are
excitable; if you feel languid, weary or
depressed, you should know that Scott's
Emulsion overcomes just such conditions.
It possesses in concentrated form the
very elements to invigorate the blood,
strengthen the tissues, nourish the nerves
and build strength.
Scott's is strengthening thousands of
mothers and will help you. No alcohol.
