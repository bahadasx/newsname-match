Germans Attack West of

Spent Themselves, In Spite
of Violence Elsewhere.
GREAT LOSSES ARE
CHARGED TO TEUTONS
General Petain Has Conceded
All, Possible, to the Attack
ers and Further Efforts will
Not Pay, it is Said.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
PARIS, April 11. The German ef
fort west of the Meuse appears to
have spent itself. The objective of
the Germans, since Sunday, has nar
rowed dov n to an attempt to reach
an important ravine which runs
around Le Mort Homme to the south,
the possession of which would involve
the envelopment of the pillar of the
French defense on the right.
To pet at the ravine they must,
however, debouch southward from
Cumieres wood by a naked crest ex
posed to the full fire of the French
lines and then break in on the French
right.
- For three days the Germans have
hammered the French defenses here
with flame throwers, shells contain
ing irritating chemicals and every
weapon of their armor' tut the lines
stand firm and unbroken and the
Germans, crippled by heavy losses,
have been forced to pause for rest
and to fill their depleted ranks.
General Petain, the French com-
the Germans he intends to . The!
French line is now located on the;
bf.ights. Any further advance, in tne
opinion of military observers lamiliar
vith the ground, will have to be
purchased at such loss that even the
t'lown Prince, who has gained among
the Trench a reputation for reckless
ness, must hesitate.
INFANTRY PAUSES.
PARIS, April 11. There wa3 a ces
sation of the German infantry as
saults to the west of the Meuse to
day although the bombardment of the
French lines between Le Mort Homme
and Cumieres continued, according to
the official communication issued by
the war office tonight. A powerful .at
tack, however, was delivered against
the French trenches between Douau
mont and Vaux., east of the Meuse.
The Germans at this point succeeded
In gaining a foothold in someof the
advanced trencr.es. but were driven
out by a counter attack.
PORTUGUESE ACTIVE.
LOl'REXCO MARQCEZ, Partuguese
Africa, (via London) April 12. Au
official communication issued today
says a Portuguese expeditionary
force occupied Kionga Monday.
The small town of Kionga and sur
rounding district ras taken twenty
years ago by the Germans in violation,
the Portuguese allege, of an existing
treaty between the two countries.
The German contention was that
Kionga formed a part of the posses
sions of the Sultan of Zanzibar on the
mainland and that 5t was thus right
fully occupied by Germany.

niininc cencern wiih large Interests at,

There are only to possibilities
. rhich are aecrpied here as tbe tru
situation. Either I'ancho Villa is dead
and his pursuit iy automatically ended
I or he is far to the south in central
j niirsimo. If the latter i true, army
officers sa.V that the entire plan or
campaign of General Pershing must
be completely reorganized or abandon
ed altogether. Ot,. officer, who has
hnd an active part in the direction of
the plan or thp expeditionary force,
sumived up the hit tuition in this way:
If Villa is dead there is no mors ti
tv. eirild' except to issue hp order for
our troops to come bncs to the l ntted
Stale its speedily as possible. If he
is rot dead, ilvre is very lit'.le reason
to doebt thi't he is. by this time, well
into the state of Durango. It is sini
rly ridirulon.i to suppose that our
troops csn keep on '.ins south indeti--iie'v
with no railroads back of them.
Th y wl'l eU'ier have to halt or ar

General Bertani said that Villa had
