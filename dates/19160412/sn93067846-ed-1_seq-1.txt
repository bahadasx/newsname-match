OFFICER ATTEMPTS TO ARREST

Ctrixene of Dei Rio Amk War Depart?

Awmy.
Del Rio, Texas, April ?.?Private
John Wade of Company C, twenty
fourth United States tnfan ry, a negro
regiment was killed here late last"
night by State Ranger Barter, when
two rangers and Sheriff Almond at?
tempted to arrest It negro soldiers!
who had created a disturbance In a
house In the restricted dlntrlct.
According to testimony before a
coroner's Jury today, Wace overpow?
ered Barter after he had been placed
under arcet and after throwing the
officer to the ground, was clubbing
him over the head with the butt of a
revolver when Barter drew his pistol
and fired, killing the soldier. The
Jury's verdict held that Barter acted
In self-denfse.
Two of Wade's companions were
arrested and are being held under
guard at the military camp.
As a result of the occurrence, tele
graraps signed by a numoer of cltl-|
sens ware sent to Washington today
asking that the negro troops, who
have been* on duty here about three!
weeks, be removed to soms other sta?
tion.
Testimony, at the inquest was to the
effect that the negroes, after being
refused admission to a house In the
restricted district returnej later arm?
ed and raided the, place, shooting out
all the windows.
Several soldiers escaped when the
officers arrived and ran In another
direction, according to the sheriff. He
said a group of these encountered a
Mexican deputy sheriff and ordered
him to hold up his hands while one
relieved him of his pistol.
"Shall we kill him/.' one was quot?
ed as saying.
* ?'No," was. .the reported reply.
"Werr? only after the white Man."

in this respect. Let the people take
this rate or leave it alon?. And, to
carry thle position to Its final analy?
sis, it means that, though the rate
may be excessive and exorbitant and
unreasonable, you people of South
Carolina have got to swallow It or
take no Insurance. They ssy let them
agree and combine and make com?
pacte among themselves as to what
the rate shall be, and make th'c ln?
flexible rate Just what they please.
In the second place, they say the
Stale has no right to, and ihould not,
supervise the rats made by them.
Leave them alone, they say, and have
no powder lodged anywhere to de?
termine whether this iron-clad rate Is
excessive, exorbitant or discrimina?
tory. Let them do as they please in
South Carolina. They say, In so many
words, take off all restraint They
are so benevolent and so philanthropic
that they will deal gently and kindly
by the people and property ownera
I "They say In this Instance, in so
many words, let the great and proud
State of. South Carolina surrender her
sovereignty to them. That seems to be
their position. But let us see a little
further of this question of State su?
pervision. The State, in the exercise
of her sovereign power, fixes the rate
of interest at which money shall be
loaned and has a State bank examin?
er to look Into the affairs of the
banking Institutions' of this State for
the protection of the people. Why
can't people and banks 1 money
at any rate they may Ax? Has th^
State the right to regulate the rate
of intereet for the protection of the
borrower as against the lender? The
State undoubtly has this right, and
exercises It. How about the State
regulating the tariffs or freight rates
and passenger rates charged by rail?
road companies doing business in th'.s
State? The State does it, and doe*
it largely by statutory eractment.
How about the State regulating hours
of labor In cotton mills? The prin?
ciple Is the same. Yet these .Treat tire
insurance companies say leavo them
alone to do as they please, and If you
don't they will leave the tftete and

endeavor In another article to ana?
lyze the anti-compact act in detail and
point out where there will be no ob?

ment should ever be allowed giving
the right to make and combine on

two points constitute thn very heart

MANY MKMBKBff ENHOLL FOR
1?16 CAMPAIGN,
Forty Counties Organized?L. L. Ra?
ker, State Agent, Gives Results for
liest Year?Road ot Prosperity.
Columbia, April 9.?Pig clubs will
be'organized in 40 South Carolina
counties, according ot L.'U Baker of
Bishopville, State agent for the boys'
agricultural club work. "Pigs and
Prosperity" will be the slogan of the
new organizations. Mr. Baker has
the assurances of many bankers that
liberal support will be given to the
pig clubs and money can be secured
at a very low rate of interest.
v Pig clubs were organized last year
in several of the counties and the
members made a fine success of their
work. There were 245 boys enrolled
In these clubs. Eighty-eight of the
members reported on their work at the
end of the year to Mr. Baker. The
boys raised and fattened . 8? hogs. The
value of the single hogs in the begin?
ning of the contest was 1322.11. The
cost of raising the hogs was $420.4 6.
The hogs at the end of the year were
valued at 11,242.70. The 89 members
of the clubs therefore made a total
profit of $521.14. Five sows were
used for breeding. The number of
pigs raised was 28. The cost of grow?
ing the sows and pigs was $25.08. The
value of the sows and pigs at the time
Of reporting was $190. The profit wie
$a08, making the total profit for all
members, $629.66.
"The banks of the State/'ssid Mr.
Baker, "are cooperating with us m
a moat substantial manner. They are
offering to lend money, and otherwise
help boys in the respective communi?
ties in the purchasing or securing of
pure bred pigs by taking their notes
for the payment of same, allowing the
boys ample time to realize from their
pigs or their progeny/*
Among the banks which have aided
the movement are: National Bank of
Elloree, $600; Bank of Bishopville,
$600; City Savings Bank of Florence,
$500; Commercial Bank of Newrberry,
WOO;'bakers of Greenville, Sl,t**Y
Her by eV Company of Bumter* $1,000;
Mil!," said Mr. Baker, "and other
banks of Tork county have offered to
lend to all worthy boys In their re?
spective communities sufficient funds
for the purchase of fertilizers and
seed for their plots and for the pur?
chase of pure bred pigs."
The pig and corn clubs, Mr.
Baker said, are being organized to
encoiirage and train boys "along the
lines of activities of rural life and to
put into practice the scientific princi?
ples obtained from books and bulle?
tins." ^*,!:
One of the most Important objects
Is to teach modem business principles
and how to apply them to agriculture.
POLICIES INTACT ON COTTON.
Commissioner Says State Warehouse
Protection Seems Not Immediately
in Danger.
? *"1 s,
Columbia, April 8.?John L. Mc
Laurln, State warehouse commission?
er, said yesterday:
"I am constantly In receipt of let?
ters from managers of State ware?
houses and from banks which are
holders of State warehouse receipts,
informing me that they are hearing
rumors that the insurance on State
I cotton has been canceled and asking
me for a statement In regard to the
matter.
"I desire to state that every ware?
house in the State system is fully and
s'fely covered, to the market value
of the cotton, and that the rumors
which are flying around to the con?
trary are absolutely untrue. . I feel
absolutely secure at this time with
regard to this insurance.
"If by any chance this Insurance
should be endangered, I would Imme?
diately make the fact known and the
holders of cotton and the banks lend?
ing money on the receipts may feel
absolutely safe, unless they should
hear directly from me to the contrary.
As a matter of fact, I feel better at
this time with regard to State ware?
house insurance than at any time
since the big Insurance companies de?
termined to punish South Carolina."

San Antonio, Texas. April 9.?Gen.
I Perching reported to Gen. Funoton to?
day that Mexican military authorities
in Chihuahua had offered the Ameri?
can punitive expedition the use of the
government! elegraph and telephone
lines. Gen. Pershing also reported
I that some supplies for the United
States troops have beer chased in
I Chihuahua but whils /chants In
that city showed no /edition to
I withhold their gey' ? the limited
amount of foodstu' C" /ailable mads
it almost impossib' ?J get provisions.
This report we ;d in some part
of the field of o ^ ion, the location
1 of which was 7 J" eld. It was trans
i mined by wir/ ^ and aeroplanes1 to
I Columbus. I g
The prof/ -? 'the use of the tele?
graph and / none lines were made
to drivers of the aeroplanes which
visited Chihuahua last week. The
aviators report that before ths popu?
lace of the city was convinced that
they were on a friendly mission, a few
stones were thrown and several shots
were fifed but no one was injured.
Gdn. Guiterex, commander of
garrison at Chihuahua, treated thjm
courteously, they reported.
The present positions of ths seV
vancisd columns was not mads pubMk,
but it was known that cavsiry
columns under Cola Brown and Dodd
are . driving south from Satevo with
all speed. Officers here had no infor?
mation that either force had gone so
far as Parral, but they said ths re?
ceipt of such information would
no surprise.
Geh. Pershing himself is moving
south along the trail to Satevo. per?
sonally airectinr, so far as pdsslbta,
the pursuit of Villa. Before leaij*
intr hls headquarters on the
Gerohimo ranch north of Gi
Oen/Pershing said Gen, Luia
the Osrranaa
him and that ths two
in a friendly manner thd efforts
made by both governments to i *t
down the common enemy.
The excellent Work that had bean
done by the aeroplanes has bean
so marked that officers are anxiously
awaiting reinforcement of that arid
i of the service. Although now recog?
nized, that the machines used are ndt
of thd type best suited to conditions
in Mexico, Gen. Pershing*s reports in?
dicate that the five in service 'AN
doing good work both in scouting and
in carrying dispatches. It wae due to
them that Gen. Pershing has been
able to keep in communication at all
with the fast moving cavalry detach*
ments.
Reports at headquarters show that
a few arrests have been made of those
who took part in the raid on Colum?
bus, N. M., a month ago today. Gen.
Pershing did not indicate where the
men were captured. Frank admission
was made at army headquarters to?
day that without the use of the rail?
roads a material strengthening of the
forces or the establishment of a new
base line of communication, the move?
ment Into Mexico could proceed
only a short distance farther unless
the advanced forces cut loose from
their bases.
If permission to use the railroad to
Chihuahua finally is denied it is be?
lieved probable that Gen. Funston will
suggest to the war department the
movement of the line of communica?
tion to some point where the base will
be nearer to the field of operations
than at present.
