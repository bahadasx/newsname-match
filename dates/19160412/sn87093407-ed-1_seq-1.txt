A WOMAN'S HEART
—i« a wonderful thing, even tho it acts mysteriously. It can
hate so completely and can love so overwhelmingly. In
"North of Fifty-three," the next novel a-week m The Star,
the woman hates intensely the man she later loves tremen
dously. She hated when he held her captive, she loved when
*he owned her freedom.
Fantastic? Maybe the glorious freedom of the North,
the wide expanse of the plains, and big mountains, and fresh
breath of the wooded country wove its spell about her and
it may not be so strange she longed to get back and away
from the stuffy city life in the East.
It'- a story with a great big, human interest.
