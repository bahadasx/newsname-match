WASHINGTON, April 10. Such marked improvement of conditions along the Mexican border
have been reported by Funston that the war department is now considering drawing upon some troops
stationed in Texas to strengthen the guard over lengthening lines of communication to tire expedition
seeking Villa. Many alarming rumors have been disposed of, and the border situation is generally
said to be quieter than heretofore, but the plan is not to disturb garrisons or the patrol in New Mexico
or Arizona for the present.
Army officials will take the stand -from nowon that the infantry be used to reinforce -communication
lines; the cavalry being kept at thca'ionffor actual work in running down the outlaws.
A part of the -Twenty-fourth infantry, negroes, has already been ordered "-into Mexico. Evidence con
tinues to accumulate to refute rumors of the impending withdrawal of thcexpedition, and it is authori
tatively stated that no suggestion has been received from Carranza referring to a "deadline," beyond
which Americans could not go, oi to the date when troops must be withdrawn.
DRUG STORE
IS LOOTED
BY EARLY
MORNING
BURGLARS
Morphine Sufficient
To Kill 50 Stolen
ONE SUSPECT IS HELD;
. COCAINE, HEROINE AND
SMALL AMOUNT ' OF
MONEY IS TAKEN BY
ROBBERS.
A quantity of morphine sufficient
to kill 50 persons, several phials of
cocaine and heroine and- several dol
lars in silver, were stolen from Br.is
ley's drug store car,ly yesterday
morning. One suspect, a man who is
said to have recently taken a cure for
the drug habit, was arrested yester
day but, until early this morning,
nothing was found to indicate his
guilt.
Brislcy left his store about 1:30
o'clock yesterday morning. As he
was walking home, he says, he passed
two men, who were slinking along in
a suspicious manner, but paid little
attention to them at the time.
When he opened up his store yes
terday morning, he found that the I
screen of a rear window had been
torn loose, and the window "jimmied"
open. The burglars had stolen more
than 100 grains of morphine, looted
the cash register of small change and
taken a small amount of cocaine and
heroin-. The morphine was in sul
phide form.
"Whoever robbed the store was cvi-
jdcntly familiar with it," said Brisley
last night. "The drugs were missing,
and tnc cash register emptied, but
nothing else was disturbed. The man
whom the sheriff's men have under
arrest frequently came into the back
of my store and watched me handle
the bottles containing the drugs. Out
side of that there has been no evi
dence found that would tend to show
that he had knowledge of the burg
lary." Recent laws passed by the Mexican

FACTO GOVERNMENT.
By Associated Press.
EL PASO, April 10. General Ga
vira, Carranza commander at Juarez,
announced today that the forces of.
tnc dc facto government were in a
position to take immediate control of
the Villa situation if the American
troops are withdrawn. The state
ment was made in connection with
the announcement of General Scott
that the .purpose of the expeditionary
force would4 be ' considered accomp
lished when the Villistas are dispersed
"or as soon as the troops of the de
facto government were able to relieve
them of their work."
Interest in the pursuit of Villa and
the diplomatic situation at Washing
ton has been largely diverted, as far
as the border is concerned, to the re
ported raising of a new revolutionary
standard by General Yncz Salazar.
Salazar is believed to have crossed the
border near Ojinaga after issuing a.
statement denouncing Carranza for
bringing about "the invasion" of Mex
ico by Americans. He is reputed one
of the ablest Mexican generals.
Elfcgo Baca, prominent lawyer, and
eight Mexicans, all of whom have
played important parts in Mexican
politics at one time and another, have
been arrested in connection with the
flight over the border of General
Salazar. Baca was later released after
having been examined by secret ser
vice agents.

Probably all data needed for the de
termination of the position of the
United States will be handed in by
the time of Friday's cabinet meeting.
Although no announcement of the
attitude of the United States is ex
pected until then, it is, the general un
derstanding that no rupture of diplo
matic relations is imminent and that
if such a crisis docs arise the presi
dent will go before congress.
