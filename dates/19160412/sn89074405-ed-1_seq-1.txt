Boston Only City to Report
Inclement Conditions for
Opening.
,, New Tork, April 12.—With dear
and fair weather reported from seven
of the eight major league cities, the
opening games of the baseball season
will probably attract big attendances.
Boston is the only city in either big
league where inclement weather con
ditions prevailed.
As is the case each season, the two
major leagues staged their opening
games equally between the east and
west. In the National league Boston
will play at Brooklyn, New York at
Philadelphia, Chicago at Cincinnati,
Pittsburgh at St. Louis. Detroit will
open at Chicago in the American
league, St. Louis at Cleveland. Phila
delphia at Boston, and Washington at
New York.
More than usual interest centers in
the first contest* this season on ac
count of the many changes in the per
sonnel of the teams and the owner
ship of clubs which have taken place,
since the winning of the world's cham*
pionshVp- by the Boston Red Sox last
Qctober ctoeed the season. of 1915.
In the Interim after the Federal
league abdicated to organised-baseball,
there followed a general^^iribntion
df the independent league players
among major and minor circuits of
baseball. Following this reconstruc
tion period, new interests bought into
the big leagues in Chicago, Cleveland.

strenuous efforts were made to

teams were virtually made over.

HEALBREACH
So Declares Senator Penrose
—Governmental Expert
Needed.
Lancaster, Pa.. April 12.—United
States -Senator Penrose in an address
last night at the annual banquet of
the republican club of this city said
that not since the civil war has the
republican party faced such great re
sponsibilities as will confront it in the
approaching national campaign. In
the enunciation of principles and the
selection of candidates, the senator
said, the party must subordinate every
personal interest or petty conflict of
opinion that stands as an obstacle to
the performance of its duty.
"The feeling prevails among repub
lican leaders. Senator Penrose said,
"that this is not the year to force the
candidacy of any individual. It may
be stated with accuracy." he added,
"that there are no candidates at the
present time for the republican nomi
nation in the usual acceptance of the
term."
Expert Needed.
"One thought seems to stand out."
the senator continued, "and that is
that the country will require in the
executive office a man of training and
intimate familiarity with the business
of the federal government and with its
diplomatic and international affairs.
This is not the time to entrust these
vast responsibilities to anyone who is
not ah expert' in governmental mat
ters. The general sentiment of repub
licans throughout the United States is
that the delegates to the national con
vention should be unpledged and un
instructed."
"The breach in the republican par
ty," Mr. Penrose said, "is now being
healed." "Anyone at this time in any
state of the union," the senator added,
"who Would attempt by factional er
other obnoxious methods, to force a
candidacy or create a condition calcu
lated to make a break in the ranks
would be generally Condemned and
repudiated by republicans'''in the
country at largs."
