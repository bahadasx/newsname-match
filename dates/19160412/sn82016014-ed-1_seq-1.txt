brought here today. The outlaws fled
in disorder Into the hills of the Vases
distrlet after losing seventy killed. It
i. reported! The de facto troops had
four tlead.
The battle took place on Sunday.
First reports were that the attacking
force was commanded by General I
Canuto Reyes. As negotiations have
been under way for the surrender of
General Reyes, under an amnesty ;
grant, bitter disappointment was ex
pressed by Carranza officials. The
surrender of Reyes was expected seri
ously to cripple the Villa cause in the
neighborhood of Torreon and Durango.
Reyes About to Surrender?
The fight was reported to have been
orecinitated by the garrison, which
was said to have fired on the troops
of General Reyes as they approached
under an agreement for peace nego
tiations. The latest details, however,
seem to show that Reyes is not im
plicated and there are still hopes that
he will ceaw w. rfare against Car
ranra. A doctor sent from here to
treat some of the men wounded in the
hattie brought back the details of the
engagement. He said the Cuntreras
and Cenicerosj attackers were subject
ed to withering fire from the garrison.
They fled In disorder. He arrived In
time to count the bodies of seventy
outlaws scattering over the battle
ground. Among the dead were a colo
nel and a captain.
It is possible this battle was the one
reported at El Paso, in which the
United States troops were thought to
have engaged.
Train Brings News of Clash.
El Paso, April 12. A battle was re
ported to have been fought near
Jiminez and I'arral. hut on account of
the Carranzista censorship the forces
engaged were not made known.
A Mexican Central tram ran into the j
fighting, later returning to Jiminez i
when the censored reports were sent j
to the border. It is not known here j
the fighting. Information from mln- i
0 ing men near I'arral placed an Ameri-
.V can detachment in that vicinity and;
viinsta nanaits were recently reportea
thereabouts. Carranzista authorities '
In Juarez were silent regarding the!
battle.
Where Villa himself is today Is a
mystery. The rumor of his death was j
believed to have been inspired by Mex
ican sources to bring about the with
drawal of the American troops.
Declares Villa Dead.
Marquese De Iao, formerly a prom
inent Villa adherent and now a Car
ranza follower, stated on his arrival i
from Chihuahua City that a Mexican
came there with positive information
of Villa's death from wounds suffered ;
in the Guerrero engagement with the ;
Carranzistas March 30.
However, all mining company re
ports tended to show that Villa was I
with a small column of bandits last
reported near Tepechuanes. Durango.
That the main American squadrons
arc in southwestern Chihuahua is
shown by negotiations between the
quartermaster's department and EI
Paso dealers for large shipments of
hay and oats to be shipped over the
Mexican Central railway by way of
Chihuahua City.
De Fact os Suppress Proclamation.
This was another indication that
American forces are in the neighbor
hood of Parral and Jiminez. where a
fight is reported to have occurred.
Kort Blis headquarters received an
unconfirmed report that an anti-
American proclamation was circulated
. in Chihuahua City ast Friday night
Presumably the Carranzista authori
ties suppressed it as all other reports
told of co-operation by the de facto
government with American forces.
Funston Views With Hope.
San Antonio, April 12. The Ameri
can expedition today is nearer the
consummation of its object than at
any time since the chase after Villa
started. This was the belief of Major
General Frederick Funston, expressed
today in the fact of discredited ru
mors of Villa's death, believed by
army officers to have been inspired.
There He (iocs! Here He Is:
Washington, April 12. A cable
gram from General Obregon to the
Mexican embassy today said Villa, ac
cording to his reports, had gene into
the mountains wounded with esfl than
150 men.
To Change IJnc Into Mexico.
San Antonio, April 12. General
Funston announced today that a
change would be made soon that
would affect the long line of commun
ications between Columbus, N. M., and
General Pershing's advanced forces.
He declined to state what that change
would be, but. barring the free use
of the railroad it was assumed by
most army officers that it had been
decided either to reinforce the line
materially or shift it to a shorter
route.

HISS NAVY HEAD
Secretary Refused to Let Ad-j
miral Read Paper.
Denunciation of "Gag" Policy
Voiced at Convention.
Washington. April 12. Secretary
Daniels refusal to permit Kear Admir
al Fiske to read a paper before the
Navy League convention here today
stirred up a wave ot denunciation
against the secretary in the meetins,
and drew hisses from one part of the
hall. The admiral's paper, previous
ly published in the Naval Institute, an
official publication 01 the navy war
college, was read by William Mather
Lewis, of Lake Forest, 111., while the
meeting cheered roundly. Col. Robt.
M. Thompson, president of the league,
read a letter from Secretary Daniels
denying a request that the admiral
read the paper and declared:
licgrets "Narrow View.'
"I desire to express my sorrow that
the navy department should take this
narrow view, so strongly in conflict
with that taken by the war depart
ment. This question goes behind a
mere departmental wish. It involves
the constitutional right of free speech,
that an officer of fifty years service
acknowledged as one of the leaders
of his profession should he denied the
right to say that two and two make
four."
Col. Thompson's mention of Sec
retary Daniels' name brought hisses
from a part of the house. Henry
Iteuterdahl and William H. Slayton
Of New York, attacked the secretary's
position and Reuterdahl declared that,
"wholesale gagging of navy officers
did not come originally from the
navy department, but originally from
the White House."
Refused Once Before.
Secretary Daniels' letter gave as a
reason for his position the attitude
taken by the department recently
when Admiral Fi.-ke was not permitted
to speak to the Commercial club of
Chicago on naval affairs. Then the
secretary wrote he thought it better
for civilians to lead the fight for en
largement of the navy and ror navy
officers to continue an unbroken pol
icy of not trying to influence legisla
tion. "Naval experts," he wrote, "will
give their views to the naval affairs
committee in congress and hearing
will be public. This gives to congress
and the people the opinions of ex
perts." "If any one here wants to defend
the' secretary's position let him arise,"
shouted Reuterdnhl.
No one arose to the defense of the
secretary.
Sidestep Big Strike.
Bayonee, N. J., April 12. Nearly
all of the 200 Tidewater Oil company
employees who struck yesterday re
turned to work today. At the Stan
dard Oil company's plant- where a
strike was also feared developments
pointed to an amicable understanding
being reached.
Wild Pheasants
Invade City and
Scratch Gardens
Portland, Ore., April 12.
Thousands of gorgeously plumed
Chinese pheasants infecting the
highways and byways of this city
today are making life a burden
for Portland housewives and
property owners. Apparently
they belong to no one in par
ticular. Game laws and anti-firearm
city ordinances prevent their
slaughter. So the birds continue
to rip out spring gardens, fly
through windows into the bosoms
of families and to play hob gen
erally. Mayor Albee has refused
S. J. Claride and other citizens
permission to shoot the pheasants,
but has instructed the police force
members to "shoo" the critters
away as much as possible.

BIG RAGES ARE ON
Major Leagues Open Season
Under Clear Skies Today.
Only at Boston Was the Weath
er at All Threatening.
Cleveland; Ohio. April 12.
Trls Speaker signed his contract
with the Cleveland American
league club today and was ready
to appear in the line-up this aft
ernoon in the opening game. De
tails of the contract were not
divulged.
Now York. April 1 2. With clear
and fair weather reported at seven of
the eight major league cities where
sames were scheduled to be played,
the opening games of the baseball sea
son today would attract big attend
ances, it was predicted. The Ameri
can league's initial contest at Boston
may have to be postponed but that
is the only city in either big league
where inclement weather conditions
prevail.
In the National league Boston plays
at Brooklyn, New York at Philadel
phia, Chicago at Cincinnati, and Pitts
burg at St. Louis. Detroit opens at
Chicago in the American league, St.
Louis at Cleveland, Philadelphia at
Boston, and Washington at New York.
II ore t ha n the usual i merest cen
ters in the first contests this season
on account of the many changes In
personnel of the teams and the own
ership of the clubs that nave taken
place since the . inning of the world's
championship by the Boston Red Sox
last October closed the season of 1915.
Teams Are Stronger.
In the interim the Federal league
abdicated to organized baseball and
there followed a general distribution
of the independent league players
among major and minor circuits of
organized baseball. Following this re
construction new interests were
bought into the big leagues In Chicago,
Cleveland, St. Louis, Boston and other
points.
In some rasee the teams were vir
tually made over, with the result that
on paper, at least, they appear far
stronger than a year ago and all in
dications point to well balanced and
hard fought pennant struggles in
both leagues. A number of former
big league stars who had cast their
lot with the Fe.derals will again be
seen on major league diamonds. In
the American league, Lee Magee,
"Germany" Sehafer, Cuilop and Gedon
will wear New York uniforms, while
Deal, Crandall, Hartley, Chapman,
Plank, Groom and Borton will play
for St. Louis.
May Fed Stars.
The consolidation of the Chicago
National and Federal league clubs
gave the Cubs a number of former
Federals, as was the case in St. Louis,
where the American and Federal or
ganization doubled up. Under Mana
ger Joe Tinker, the following players
will wear Chicago National uniforms:
Yerkes, Hendrix, Zwilling, Seaton,
Zeider, Flack. Brown and others. The
New York Giants will show Benny
Kauff, Rousch, Rariden and Anderson
on their roster. Hal Chase, a former
American league star, will be back
in the big circuit, playing first base
for Cincinnati. In addition, two fa
mous stars will be seen in new uni
forms. Frank Baker, former star of
the Athletics, will play third base for
the New York Americans, while Tris
Speaker, long a member of the Boston
Red Sox, will play with Cleveland

(By Bertha Hempstead.):
The second day's seEgions of the
largest convention of the Kansas-State
Federation ever held, opened thiaM
morning at o'clock in Memorial
The feature of today's program was
the luncheon at Washburn college
gymriasium, where Mrs. Carrie Chap
man Catt was one of the guests of
honor. Mrs. Catt is making the, trip
to Topeka to be present at the con
vention of the Kansas Equal Suffrage
association, which convenes Thurs
day. She was urged to come a day ear
lier, and made her arrangements to
be In town today. She arrived late this
forenoon from the east, and was tak
en immediately to the home of Gov
ernor and Mrs. Arthur Capper, and
from there to the luncheon at Wash
burn. She made a brief address fol
lowing the luncheon.
Mrs. Catt is president of the Nation
al Equal Suffrage association. suc
ceeding in that office Dr. Anna How
ard Shaw, who held it many years.
Mrs. Catt also is president of the in
ternational suffrage organization. She
Is a remarkable woman in an Intellec
tual way. She is a good speaker, a
person of poise and culture, and she
has no small degree of good looks.
She heads the faction in suffrage work
that advocates the winning of the bal
lot for women by the process of con
verting the states one by one, as op
posed to the faction that believes the
dominant political party can be
brought to assist a national amend
ment through congress, by means of
the pressure put upon it by the unit
ed vote of the women of enfranchised
states.
Two Factions Here.
The thing that lends poignancy to
the situation in Topeka today is the
fact that the leaders of the two op
posite factions are sitting at luncheon,
surrounded by their local adherents,
in the same town on the sa,me day; for
the O. H. P. Belmont suffrage work
ers and their Kansas followers are
dining uptown this noon. While the
federation has nothing to do with pol
itics, and as a body of enfranchised
women recognize the justice of equal
suffrage as only one of the principles
they stand for; and while the coming
of Mrs. Catt for the federation party
is somewhat incidental to the conven
tion proceedings; still the idea has
been forming in the minds of Topeka
women, that those who attend the
luncheon for the suffrage squadron at
Pelletier's are somehow committed to
the Congressional Union policy, while
inose wno remain away are agin it.
though not nearly ail of the Topeka j
federation women are able to find
places at the federation luncheon.

other out-of-town club women have
arrived, that many of the local club j

All the factional jealousy engen

head today when 23 New York

day Invaded Kansas.
Never in the hibtory of suffrage
campaigns in Kansas has such a dem
onstration been given in Kansas as the
one which was on the program of the
Congressional Union. For weeks they
have carefully prepared for the inva
sion of the state. Now, with the Dem
ocratic state convention barely out ot
the way. the Congressional Union
leaders seek to send a new fear to the
hearts of the Kansas Bourbons in
Washington.
More than 150 visitors and Kansas
club women and' suffrage leaders sat
at a luncheon this afternoon in Pelle
tier's tea room. Short speeches were
made by a number of women in the
official party from the east. They
urged the necessity of a women's par
ty In this state that would aid the wo
men of other states in winning their
battle.
Following the luncheon, the women
took their flags and banners and
started for a campaign of the business
district. Nearly a dozen women vol
unteered to make speeches on street
corners and in juhlic places in an ef
fort to arouse the Kansas enthusiasm
for national suffrage.

State Labor Commissioner.
This is the statement made today
! by Paul J. McBride, state labor com
i missioner, in answer to an article pub
1 lished in the Topeka Capital mini
mizing the state and city reports to
the effect that the Grand Opera house
is unsafe and unfit for public use.
, When the attention of Governor Ar
j thur Capper was called to the charge
that his paper had tried to influence
, a state official and has his department
practically repudiate a statement that
; they had issued only after a most
careful investigation had been made,
he seemed amazed and made the fol
j lowing statement:
Governor Will Find Out.
"I know absolutely nothing
: about Mr. Crawford's trouble with
Commissioner McBride. 1 have
not discussed the subject with Mr.
Crawford, Mr. McBride or with
any one connected with my news
paper. I have no time for mat
ters of this kind. I am giving
about one hour a week to my
newspaper business. I do not be
lieve that any employee of the
Capital suggested to Commission
er McBride that his order be mod
ified. If this was done, it was a
serious mistake. He was mixing
in something that did not concern
him. I shall inquire into the mat
ter myself and if anything of this
kind has been done, I shall call
down the man who did it. But,
as I said before, I cannot believe
that any one connected with my
paper has been attempting to in
fluence this state official."
After handing his statement to the
State Journal the governor said:
"You can't make that statement too
strong for me for I would not stand
for any such actions one instant. All
this matter has come up at a time
when every moment of my time is
taken up with affairs of state and I
have not given it any thought or at
tention but," and here the governor
looked steadily at the interviewer. '"I
certainly will from this moment."
Work All Over State.
Commissioner McBride said this
morning relative to the inspection:
"We are doing this work all over
the state and we have simply come to
Topeka in the natural course of our
inspections. We have not singled it
out to make a horrible example at all.
It is in line with our duties, and if
we are to live up to them we must
make an inspection in Topeka.
"We are now at work on it and will
continue to do our duty as facts pre
sent themselves to us, regardless of
whom it may hit. We are not playing
one class or firm against another.
They all will be trea-ted the same and
all will get a square deal from this
department. We have no axes to grind
or old scores to clean off the slate.
Its our duty and we are simply ful
filling it."
WEATHER STAYS GOOD
Slightly Liower Temperatures Pre
dicted by the Weather Bureau.
Usually warm weather prevailed
over the state last night with no pre
cipitation reported at any place. A
slight change is expected for tomorrow
though the general aspect of the
weather will continue the same. The
wind remains in the southwest but it
has dropped considerably in velocity
since last night.
The forecast calls for fair weather
tonight and Thursday; cooler tonight
and in the eastern and southern por
tions of the state Thursday. The mer
cury is expected to go slightly lower
tonight than last night but no severe
drop is in prospect.
The lowest temperature last night at
Topeka was 62 degrees. This Is 20 de

FIND VILLA LOOT
Carranza Soldiers Dig Up
$5,000,000 Treasure.
Buried hj General Frbina,
Later Killed by Villa.
El Paso. April 12. Five million dol
lars worth of loot buried by the late
General Tomas t'rbina has been re
covered by Carranzista military forces,
according to an official announcement
by Consul Garcia here today.
The treasure was buried on the Las
Xiexos ranch in Durango. It com

coins and Vwelry, twenty bars of gold
bullion, some silver bullion and loot
from Mexican churches, besides 800,
000 in bank notes.
The Carranzistas under General

of campaigning as Villa's most trusted
lieutenant. When Villa broke with
Carranza and needed funds to finance
his own revolution. Villa went to T"r
bina's headquarters and demanded
half the loot. Prbina refused and was
