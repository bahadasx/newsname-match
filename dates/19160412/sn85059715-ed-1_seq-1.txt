BY HIGH COURT i
i
:? 1
jWest Virginia Supreme Court'
of Appeals Passes on Five
Appeal Cases.
(sv AtaociATio rm.t)
CHARLESTON, April 12.?Five
opinions have been handed down by
the supreme court of appeals. They
are as follows:
Dorr against railway company,
from Pocabontas county, reversed
and bill dismissed;,lumber company
Ortoll, from Nicholas county,
reversed In part and decree for appellant;
Smith against the county
court from Kanawha county, mandamus
refused; Fleming against
people, from Marion county, reversed
and Judgment here; Fleming against
Morgan from Marlon county, reversed
judgment here.
In the case of Smith against the
Kanawha county court, the decision
was rendered last Tuesday, but the
opinion, by Judge Poffenbarger, was
not reported until today. The syllabus
says in part:
"In the absence of fraud or violation
of positive law, courts will, recognize
and vindicate rights accorded
by the decision of such tribunals In
the cases In which a statute makes
it the duty to recognize and enforce
them.
"In the absence of a statute conferring
the Jurisdiction, courts will
not undertake to settle and determine
substantial controversies between
rival political committees or factions
of such committees, the right of
which is dependent upon party rules,
usages and customs, nor grant relief
to either of such committees or factions
as the representative of the party."
The court found in the decision In
the case of Dorr against the Chesapeake
and Ohio Railway Company
that equity will not cancel a deed
for a railroad right or way, made on
a valuable consideration expressed
therein when the sole cause alleged
for the cancellation Is the failure or
refusal of a carrier engaged in Interstate
commerce to Issue annual passes
for. life as additional consideration
pursuant to an oral agreement.
An appeal' a^id snpercedeas was allowed
In the case from Kanawha
county of Elk Milling and1 Produce
Company against C. C. Lewis, Jr.,
and others. Writs of error and supercedeas
were-refused in the cases
of F. B. Enlow, assignee, against city
of Huntington, from Cabell county,
and Frutt'Dlspatch Company against
Ellis, from' Marshall oounty. ,

while the American cavalry are

Villa's pursuers away from the hiding

Mexican followers of Villa say It
was a favorite trick of the bandit
leader when the chase became hot
for him to have the story spread that
he was dead so that the ardor of his
pursuers might be dampened. Army
officers at Fort Bliss declare that If
the Villa death tsory Is a hoax, It

"Last Thursday a band of twenty '
>f Villa's men rode up to the ranch c

: had and killed one of my cows and c
lad a great feast. They had several ?
lottles of liquor that they had se- ?
lured at Guerrero and Mlnaca and 1
rot pretty drunk before they were J1
ihrough. *
"They ridiculed the American sol- "
Hers and boasted about the way J
Villa had fooled the 'grlngoes' by *
lending guides to the American offl:ers
with stories of different places J
in which he was hiding. Then they '
talked about Lopez and said he was .
lying and that as soon as he was dead
the 'grlngoes' would be told It' was {
Villa and then they would all go .
home.
"They did not say anything differ- j
ent about the whereabouts of ,
Villa, but I understood from
their talk that he was far to the (

Agree with the Brilliant
Virginia Evangelist.
The Rev, Prank Y. Jackson
preached another great sermon laat
evening. He Bclected an his text the
ninth chapter ot the gospel, by St.
[-like, and the twenty-third verse, "If
my man will come after me, let him
leny himself and take up hie cross
laily and follow me." He spoke In
>art as follows:
"Possibly the most misunderstood
laying of our Lord is this text. The
toss Is a symbol of the greatost pain
ind shame; bi)t Jesus did not lntlnate
that the Christian life was a
Ifc of pain and shame. Nevertheless,
nen have persistently supposed that
o be a follower of Jesus meant t?
ive a life filled with sorrow and entering.
On the contrary, to become a
Christian Is to live the largest freest,
loblest and happiest life. Every figire
of speech in the New Testament
ndlcates this truth. Life, light, love,
oy and peace are. the words which
prlng up In the gospel stories as the
owers are coming forth 1 nthe meadiws
today. The cross Is His way rf
aylng: "In order to have tne best
hlngs In the universe we must ener

Then followed the discussion of

The Pending
As an Attempted Raid on Public
Property and Opposes
Passage of Same.
Gilford Pinchot, former chief forester
of the United States, writes
from his home at MUford, Fa., to the
Telegram as follows:
The Iniquitous Shields bill, giving
away the waterpowers on our navigable
streams, about which I wrote you
on February 16, has been driven
through the Senate, but It .has not
passed the' House. There Is still a
good chance not only to stop-this
raid on public property, but to pass a
fair and' honest waterpower bill in
Its place.
Everything I said about the Shields
bill In my letter to you was confirmed
In the debate. According to Its
own supporters, this bill turns over
to the power interests waterpower
equivalent to twice the mechanical
power: of every kind now In use In
the United States, or enough to meet
the needs of the hundred million
people. 'This it eoes In perpetuity,
* ~ 1l~.lt , tkn
aituuugii pi ciouuiug iu iiujii iuo
grant to fifty years. Small wonder
there is pressure to get It through.
On March 21, a substitute for tho
Shields bill was reported to - the
House of Representatives. Unlike
the Shields bill, this House bill
roakes, no perpetual grant of public
waterpowers without compensation;
sets a limit of fifty years. Nevertheless,
It Is not yet a good bill.. For
example, it gives away the public
waterpowers without compensation.
There Is no reason why the waterpower
corporations should not pay
for -what they get. The rest of us
do. The House bill should be amended
accordingly.
If the House corrects its own bill
and then passes It, the good bill from
the House and the bad bill from the
Senate will go to conference, and
the differences will be adjusted by
the conferees. The managers of the
waterpower campaign believe that a
majority Of the conferees will be
friendly to them, and will report a
bill in' their Interest. They will then
try to rush the conference bill
through, probably, in the confused
and crowded final hours of the session.
Snch a plan hits often served
the special interests. In the past, and
It Is-dangerous now.
During the .debate on the Shields
bill, this coune was openly advised.
There was under discussion an
amendment giving preference to the
npplican1 for a public waterpower
