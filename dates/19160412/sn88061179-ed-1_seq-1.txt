SOME HISTORY OF BIG STONE GAP
In tho early (lays liefere the
town was laid oil'ami established,
Big Stone Gap was known a
"'three Forks", and ii is well
authenticated thai Daniel Boone,
in one of his several trips 10
Kentucky, passed through the
Gap crossing to Hie headwaters
ot tho Cumberland in Kentucky.
Big Stone. Gap was Once ih
(lie County of Finenstlc, which
Iben ein braced all of Southwes?
tern Virginia and all of the State
of Kentucky, ami so remote
were some portions of the Coun?
ty, that an Ad was passed pro?
viding tluil "jurors shall not be
summoned from the waters of
the Ohio ami Mississippi Rivers
more than once a year."
In 177ii, the lirsl year of the
Commonwealth of Virginia, Kin
castle was divided into three
Counties, one of thein Kentucky
County, embracing the presch!
limits of that Slate and tlx' oili?
er two Washington and Mont?
gomery, embracing all of South?
western Virginia.
The last Indian raid made in.
to Southwestern Virginia was
by the half breed Chief Beuge,
who was killed at the head wat?
ers of Powell's Itiver, not far
from Big Stone Cap. through
which the frontiersmen passed
to the point where he was inter?
cepted, and killed, the stream,
to this day being called "Bongo's
Branch", and the rock upon
which he was laid after lie was
killed being culled '?Bongo's
Uocki"
Big Stone Cap remained in
Washington County until I7'.)i!,
when a new County was formed
from ? Washington ami named
l.ee, aller Light Horse Harry
l.ee, (General Robert IS. Lob's
father), which embraced Big
Stone Gap, until 1850, when
Wise- County was formed from
l.ee, Scott and Kussel I, having
been named after Governor
Henry A. Wise.
Long before there was any
thought of establishing a town
h?re, the long stretch of level
land, now embraced in the Ball
Purk und Athletic grounds, was
celebrated as a race track, where
upon holidays, ami many other
occasions, all lie- country side
tor a long distance resorted to
the "Three porks"', to race and
trade horses, one of these a marc
limited "Kate Witclier"i won
races all tho way from Cumber?
land Gap to Abiiigdon, Virginia,
ami it was the pleasure of the
writer to see her run and win a
race in Washington County
about fifty years ago, and if
alive, she would give t 1, e
thorough brods of to-day a run
for their money.
In curlier days, the celebrated
"horse thief, Murrell and many
of lesser faniCj ran their stolen
horses through Big Stone Gap
into Kentucky, and sold thein ;
many horse thieves having been
caught and killed in the Cap.
At one time there was a regular
!? line of stations, where horse
thieves were harbored with
?y stolen horses from the Carolinas
?? *nd Tennessee, and even as I'ar
Soul Ii us < teorgia, hut with the
jg thicker settling up of the coiin
try they were linally broken up
it and the thieves either killed or
3 driven away.
This section of the Slate wa
i settled by a strong pioneer race,
H who were true to the South dur

B05, the bronze medal being

Hone of which we recall, whero a

afraid of liini. The minister
haying to make a journey to

oath and bo paroled, stated hi
I rouble l<> a friend as he return*
cd. Knowing (he character "f
the man in the church, the
friend said : "1 will li\ l ha I,"
And he sal down und w rote u
letter, purporting to come from
the Ullitod States Oiliror tit t 'nm

appear ami tiuswei for various
robberies ami other crimes com?
mitted, which letter lie gave the I
minister to deliver. It so hap-1
pened that the minister met the I
church occupant as lie returned,!
and he was very cordial, asking!
for tlie news and how he had j
come out with the United States
Officers, and the minister lifter
answering him said: "By the
way, 1 have a letter for you",
and handed it to him. The man
who COIlld not read, hut would
not admit it, said: "I'urson I
have left hie 'specs' at home,
you read it. for me." Nothing
loth, the I'arson read the letter
to him which was punctured by
many ''grunts" from the man.
After the letter was read lie

say anything about this letter,

When tin- value of tho coals
of Wise County were demon?

County began to prosper, for
whilst as early as the date
Thomas -leHerson prepared his
"Notes on Virginia", the exist
ance of valuable coals in the
mountains, west of the Blue
liidge, had been known: the re?

developed and it-a-d, had caused

The result of General I 111 bod
en's trip was, that whilst he
found largo deposits id' valuable
ores, they were so far from the
railroads as to make them tin
considerable grading lmd boon

lie formed to take over and com- ]
plcte the railroad in connection j
with Hie purchase of largo, tracts

profitable biisincsSi
When General Iinbndon re
ttirned to Pittsburgh and made
his report, the people who had
sent him out, wanting iron ores
for immediate use, were not fur?
ther interested, but being a man
of indomitable energy and push,
lie succeeded in organizing a par?
ty of business men, who made
the purchases, including the
railroad, which they ro-cbni
inoiiced work upon.
This Company, know n as the

To realize the wonderful prog?
ress which has been made since
that time, it i- only necessary to
reeall that there was not a mile
of railroad in operation inSoilth

main line of the Norfolk and
Western Railroad : thai the near?

Louisville and Nashville, at Liv?

At this time pig nit'll mnnufac-;

All this has has changed now,

erties of the Virginia Coal ami

Ith many brunch lines. There
are more miles of railroad in
Wi-o County than there was in
Southwest Virginia in IS8I.
Southwest Virginia and Wise
County have realized all their
earlier dreams and more.
Soon after General Inibodcti
made up the pioneer company to
buy the first properties, he came
to Big Stone Gap, niii.lt him a
cottage and office, laid off tho
old Eljcaiiah GlHy tract of land
into lots and named tho town
'"Iinhoden City", which was t'no
beginning of the present town of
Big Stone Gap. hnboden City
struggled along until 1888, when
a company was formed known as
(lie Mio Stone Gap Improvement
Company, which acquired a largo
boundary of land, employed a
skilled German Engineer, Mr.
John Nailer, who laid off Iho
present; town of Big Stone (Jap
with it< wide streets and beau?
tiful park system.
In the Winter and Spring of
1889-00, the town had a verita
I'!" boom and the prices soared,
lots sellino as high as $3500.00;
more than $250,000.00 worth
having been sold at one auction.
This boom, of course, collapsed,
hut after '?gelting its breath",
the town began to build up upon
a -'did foundation, with real
value-, and has continued to im?
prove ami grow since that time.
Il was fortunate fur l?g Stone
Gup that from the time it com
ui. te ed to grow, its citizens have
been strout; und virile, coming
from many dilfcroht States, in?
cluding many highly educated
men and women. It has grown
along broad lines, there being
fewer narrow people than aro
found in towns double its size.
Nothing daunted by the col?
lapse "I it- boom, its people set
to work in build up the town,
the only industries al that lime
being an iron furnace and pian?
ino mill.
The necessity for larger he
cotutnodtitions for the public
school became urgent and with?
out hesitation a bond issue was
made ami a commodious building
tytts eroded, Lut was destroyed
by lire a few years afterwards.
Not deterred iiy this misfortune,
n liiueh larger and imposing
building was erected, which is
the most complete and up to
date school building outside of
the cities, in (lid State.
The school has been the lirst
care of the town. If revenues
were short and a cut had to be
made nothing was taken from
I he s,.|k?,| appropriation, and
rat her I hau cut a month from
the term, her liberal citizens
have uiore iban once voluntarily
contributed money to continue.
Coming into the town a stran?
ger has a very inadequate idea
i.f its size aiul importance from
the fuel that its length is three
miles, aiul its width two miles.
Many of the bosl residences are
not seen by a party coining in
and going out on mi lues*. It
has a population ol Soufc i f?llt).
The e.nterpi i . embrace a
large extract plant und a large
tannery ; wood working plant ;
brick plant and many other
-mall industries.
I'ropariitions arc now being
made In put Hid iron furnace in
Operation, and (lie erection of a
large cement plant here is being
considered. We have a large
and imposing United States I'nh
lie Building, containing the
I'osl Ullicc, United States Dis
trict i'ourl Room and Ollicos,
Internal Revenue Agent, Mar?
shal ami United States Commis?
sioner's < Mlices.
The town has a supply of pure
-nl't water., taken from I'owell'3
River, at the foot of I'owell's
Mountain, si\ miles away, with
four hundred feet fall, three
million gallons capacity per day,
and full lire protection, without
engines.
It has electricity for light and
power, supplied at very reason?
able rates by the Bleptric Trans?
mission Company*of Virginia.
A movement is on foot, look?
ing loa junction of the Louis?
ville ami Nashville and the Vir?
ginia ami Southwestern Rail?
ways, ami the building of a
Union Depot, in 'he center of
the town. New buildings are
going up steadily and the de?
mand from '.I'wcomcrs is stead?
ily increasing, and the citizens
look forward with bright Iiopo
for the future growth ami pros?
perity of the town, which situat?
ed in a valley nine miles long
and two miles wide, is far and
away the best located town in
the coal lields, with a enpacity
I tor almost indefinite expansion.
