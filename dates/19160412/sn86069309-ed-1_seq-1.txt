England, Germany and
France Agree
on one thing, if on no other. They all prohibit
the sale of alum baking powders.
There must be a good reason for this.
It is because alum was found to be un

Royal Baking Powder is made of cream
of tartar, derived from grapes, a natural
food product, and contains no alum nor
other questionable ingredients.

Born in Franklin Pierce's Time.
Scott Cart, of Union Star, was born
on the same day that Franklin Fierce
was ducted president of the United
States. He was named for Winfk'ld
Scott, and Is very proud of his birthday
and of his name sake. Says he Is the
same kind of a Democrat today as
those grand men. Scott used to be
a power In politics in this county when
lie played It. Says hu has retired
from the game, but Is still a true blue
Democrat.
Extended to Mr. Willis Noel,
Oldest Man in This City, From
S. C. Bates, of Athens, Ohio.
Dear Mr. Ilabbage: Your paper today
inuouuces that Willis Noel has passed
his ninety-fourth birthday. It is a rare
enough thing for any one to reach that
age to be worthy of comment, but when
it is one held in as high esteem as
"Uncle Willis," it deserves more than
even a passing mention.
His faculties are clear. His sight is
good. His step is as elastic as many a
one forty years younger. The people of
his early life in lloone county are all
gone. The men and women of llreck
enridge county, when he came to it sixty
years ago, have almost all passed over
the river. He is an ornament to your
community, and I am glad your people
treat him so well.
I have been so busy that I have uot
written to him, and I wish, through
your columns, to express my congratula
tions, aud the hope that while he is
spared to his friends, he may retain his
faculties in perfection. Then I wish to
say to my friends who are not so old:
Life is uuceitaiu in its extent. It is
only certain in the opportunity it pre
sents for preparation for that other
world, and in the service we may al
ways render for our Master, and tor His
children here.
My sympathy is with the old town in
the loss of the shops, and in the hope
that they may be rebuilt larger and bet
ter than ever.
I have done some driving this winter,
partly over paved roads, and partly in
mud where two horses could scarcely
pull a buggy. I hope Hal's advice
about good roads iu Ilreckeuridge county
will set your people to thinking about
the matter until roads will be produced
that will he a joy to all your citiens.
Sincerely yours,
S. C. ItATKS,
Athens, Ohio.
