DRIFT ADVANCES
i
The rush for KeHCtie Eula Block thin
morninK filled the brokerage offices
to the doom with Interested pntrons
of the market. The advance In silver
made the end re list strong and
brought out a buying movement such
as has not been evident since the
first week of March when the Rescue
began to attract notice.
Officials of the Rescue, when asked
concerning the sudden rise, stated
that it was probably caused by an Im
provement In the width of the vein
and the value of the ore which has
taken place In the lust four or five
days in the east drift. No definite
(inures as to width or values could
be had but it Is known that the full
width of the drift Is in ore and that I
values are very good being as high.!
if not higher, than any that have'
shown In this vein since It was open !
ei. The east drift is out a distsneej
of about 1,10 feet and the vein is tin-;
broken for that distance with the ore
shoot continuous for the entire dis
tance. All ore broken In driving this
drift has been milled at a profit. j
No. 1 raise Is up over 60 feet and i
is in continuous ore for that distance
and the values In the face at present
are more than satisfactory.
No. 2 raise Is up about 30 feet, and
the same conditions as to ore exist.
No. 3 raise, started last week,
shows the greatest width of ore of
any of the raises with satisfactory
values.
Two shipments have already been
sent out this week.

Madre Range
(By Associated Press.)
EL PASO, Apr. 12 Masking his trail with the deluding fiction spread
broadcast by peons that he Is dead, Villa is believed by the Mexican officials
of Juarez to be hidden in the recesses of the Sierra Madres while Americans
are pursuing a rear guard band of Villistag whose strategy It Is to beguile the
pursuers from the hiding place of their chief.
Villa's Mexican followers say that in other campaigns this was the
favorite trick of Villa when a chase got hot to have a story circulated that
he was dead so the ardor of his pursuers would be dampened.
That the Americans have penetrated far beyond Parral Is indicated in
messages. It seems that Villa, Is alive, has passed Into the mountain fast
nesses of Durango.
Reports from the front state the cavalry is still pressing pursuit and that
no time' has been lost through circulation of the report of Villa's alleged
death. The trail has been kept in sight without any slackening of speed and
scouts say the troops are steadily shortening the distance between the fugi
tive. '

PEKING. Apr. 12 Since the occu

trades from Japan have flocked into
Shantung province in lurgo numbers
and have begun trading operations in
centers where they have no treaty
rights. Many of the traders are col
lecting old copper cash, the Chinese
coins which have a hole In the center
and are carried on at rings, and are
melting the coins down and selling
the copper at a big profit.
Traffic In the Chinese copper cash
is going on In many pnrts of China, re
gardless of the central government's
regulations forbidding the exportation
of cash.
Seventy thousand pieces of copper
cash were recently seized by Chinese
officials on a train at Changchun In
Central Manchuria. This money was
concealed In trunks and checked by
Japanese. The cash Is shipped to
Shanghai or to Japanese ports where
It Is melted down and brings a high
price because of the scarcity of cop
per. In Peking and the more important
commercial centers on the railways
In China, cash Is used only by the
Chinese. The rate of exchange varies
greatly in different places. Ordinarily
ten cash are worth one copper cent.

PANAMA, Apr. 12. For several

has been engaged in surveying the At

erous difficulties with the San Bias
Indians. Serious clashes have been
avoided only by the tact and patience
of the officers of the ship.
One annoyance the officers have had
to contend with has been the removal
ot cloth markers that the surveyor
placed along the shore. The Indiana
found the bright calico too great a
temptation to resist. After numerous
remonstrances, the officers thret n
ed that for each marker stolen cer
tain number of cocoanut trees would
be felled in reprisal. This had the de
sired result, for after a few trees had
been chopped the Indians realized that
the price was too high to pay for a
