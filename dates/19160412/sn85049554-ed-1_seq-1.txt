SENATE RETAINS SUGAR DUTY.
Votes to Postpone Tariff Removal For
Four Years.
Washington, April 12.—The senate
yesterday afternoon, without a roll
call and with only one or two dlssent-
caucus, postponing for four years the
operation of the free sugar cl&use of
tho Underwood tariff act.
The bill was recommended by Presi
dent Wilson as one of the easiest ways
of raising revenue for the program of
national defense. As the house bill
was a definite repeal of the free sugar
clause without any limit of time, the
measure will now have to go to con
ference.
Senator BrouBsard, Louisiana, urg
ing the indefinite repeal, said he has
assurances the house will hold fast to
its bill.
The real test of strength yesterday
came over the motion of Senator Sim
mons, of North Carolina, chairman of
the committee on finance, to substitute
the senate for the house provision.
Republicans naturally voted against
the substitution, as the indefinite pro
tection given sugar In the house bill
was more to their liking thati the
four-year term of the senate bill. Four,
democrats—Mr. Broussard and Mr,
Kanedell, of Louisiana, Mr. Newlands,
of Nevada, and Mr. Lane, of Oregon
voted with them. The new language
prevailed by a vote of 40 to M. All
the republicans voted against the sub
stitution. j.
