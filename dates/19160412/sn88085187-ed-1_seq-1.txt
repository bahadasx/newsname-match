.lust Tike a stick, there are
two cud- to this business of
reinstating the Mountain's
right name.
As this is ipill mi a lout;
stick, we hate done well to
take hold of hut one end at
a time.
> Tlie one end I mean is the
pulling down of the British
a.hniial.
Seattle, as I have already
shown, concedes now, in the -spir
it of a later and better time, that]
the admiral who fought us ef
fectively during the revolution i
has no claim upon the most splen
did monument on earth —in the
state called Washington.
As Seattle joins with us In re
nouncing the nine Rainier, >>c
are about read; to let go that end
of the stick.
Mayor QUI, Rev. Sydney
Strong, Jttdge Itonald, Frank .'l.
llankes, ever) minister of every
church in that city and every
newspaper that lias spoke.i a
word about the subject in the l:ist
months have spoken strongly in
fHvor of letting the admiral de
part from a community which
he has done so much to muss up.
What's still To l»o.
We are ready to let go I hat
end of the stick lust as soon as
we can, through some organized
body, put ourselves in form to
go over and effect a treaty with
the people of Seattle who have
already met nr more than half
c way.

A WOMEN'S HEART
—in a Wonderful thing, oven though it arts mysteri
ously. It can hate so completely and can love so
overwherniingly. In "North of Fifty-three," the
next novel-a-week in The Times, the woman hates
intensely the man she later loves tremendously. She
hated when he held her captive, she loved when she
owned her freedom.
Fantastic If Mayhe the glorious freedom of the
North, the wide expanse of the plains, and big moun
tains, and fresh breath of the wooded country wove
its spell about her —and it may not be so strange she
longed to get hack and away from the stuffy city life
in the East.
It's a story with a great big, human interest.

Christianity in Tac"ii):i
churches and in cliiirclies

censed In he a religion based
fiuidiimeiitally on dogmas,

This was the opinion of x,\ia
tors of various deiiominations to
day In discussing tlie action of
Hie New York l*r. sb\ tery yester
day in iuiiihp to accept as I'res
hyteriiin ministers three seuiin
ary graduates who refused to af
firm the biblical accounts re
i ferred to above.
Most of the pastors Interview
ed were of the opinion that Bible
study and interpretation lias been
puelng through a great period of
transition and that Christianity
is coming into its own as a mor
al and spiritual faith first and
foremost.
Other physical events ;:nd
stories outlined in Hie Bible nave
taken a plßce of secondary im
portance.
Old Idea Xot lair.
Rev. Frank Dyer of the First
Congregational church summed
up the opinion of most of the Ta
coma pastors this way:
"It isn't fair to make Hie Chris
tian religion depend on a physical
fact which occurred some 2,000
years ago, and which, in the na
ture of the case, cannot he proved.
Christian!!-.' is a moral and spirit
ual faith first of all and makes
a moral and spiritual demand.
"I do not Insist on a belief that
Christ was born of a virgin. The
virgin birth has nothing to do
with tlie great truth of Hie rein
carnation and divinity of Christ."
Great Transition.
Rev. Robert 11. Milligan of the
linnianiiel Presbyterian church
put it this way:
"The study of the Bible has
been going through a great tran
sition in recent years. It is not
the time to dogmatize, but the em-'
pbestie the truths which are fund
amental to the Christian faith.
The graduates referred to are
from the Union Theological semi
nary, which is very progressive.
Yet Dr. Patten of Princeton semi
nary, who represents Hie most
comlervative of tlie Presbyterians,
refuses to make the virgin birth.
or the other stories referred to,
the conditions of accepting Chris
tianity, though ho expresses his
own personal belief in them."

A FUSS
Attending a meeting at the
Washington school last night to
Which lie had not beta Invited,
('. F. W. Hoover, one of the can
didates for city councilman, cre
ated considerable excitement by
lumping to bis feet doling some
or the addresses, pointing his
linger at tlie speakers, and brand
ing campaign statements as.
"barefaced lies."
St.lever's interruptions tempor
arily stopped the meeting, He
was finally permitted to speak,
and devoted bis time to a vituper
ative outburst.
tt us (ii.men Meeting, ■
Th<' meting was called by
friends of Hamilton F. (ironen,
piu.l Pro 808 was the principal
speaker. Btoever, accompanied bjr
Mrs. Stoever, attended tlie gath
ering on request of w. i>. aakren,
his campaign manager, who lives
in the Washington school district.
Hermal Martin, a member of
Oronen'a campaign committee, ex
plaiaed to the audience that the
meeting was Invitational, and that
certain statements might be made
during tlie evening about rival
candidates.
Later, in a brief talk, Martin
attacked Stcever.
Supported by Saloons.
"At the Hiiio Stoever ran for
mayor two years ago, it was com
mon knowledge that lie was sup
ported by the saloon interests and
the vice element of the city. It
was openly reported that the town
would be open if Smever were
elected. From al! Hint I can
learn, the same conditions exist
today. The same elements are
supporting Mr. Stoever, and tlie
same rumors are in circulation,"
said he.
Stoever demanded that Martin
make bis charges in writing. He
interrupted Martin at frequent in
tervals during his address, and
broke in upon the speeches of
other Gronen men.
When he was finally allowed
to speak, Stoever denied that he
was supported by any vice ele
ment.
Attacks McGregor, Too.
Then he began an attack on
Gronen, and on 11. J. McGregor,
who was also present.
"McGregor came to me after he
was defeated at the primaries
and said that he would support me
if 1 would promise him the posi
tion of superintendent of water
works," Stoever declared.
"1 refused to make a promise.
Now McGregor is supporting (iro
neu. 1 understand Hist he is
slated to get the appointment if
Gronen is elected.
"I am not allowing any such
dirty politics to enter my cam
paign. These charges against me
are Instigated by Mayor Fawcett,
who has taken an active hand In
(he municipal campaign."

Suit was filed today by
Prosecutor lEeuiaiin against
the Pacific Coast Steamship
to. to tesl the legality of sec
tions ill 11 if prohibition law
regarding the shipment of In

The suits are the outgrowth of
the seizure last night of more
than $l,ono wortli of liquor co I
slgnad to the Gin Drngg Co. of
South Tacoma which arrived on
the steamer Governor from San
Francisco.
The liquor arrived from Cali
fornia on the steamer Governor
and was marked "Seeds.''
"lection is of the law ipeelfl
callv sliites," said Remaiin lo.lay,
"that it is unlawful for any trans
portation company to haul any
liiiuor Into the stale without an
auditor's permit fixed In a con
spicuous place on each parcel.
"Section 20 provided that tho
label. Tills package contains in
toxicating liquor," be placed on
every parcel." he continued. "In
the shipment taken over by Ine
county officers; yeslerday both of
thes sections were disregarded.
"This will simply be a lest toll
and we believe our understanding
of the law will hold good. George

out two permits with the county
auditor. There is no limit to the
amount a druggist can order, but
he must have a permit for every
box.'"
Rumors readied the court
house this morning that (till was
on asking for an Injunc
