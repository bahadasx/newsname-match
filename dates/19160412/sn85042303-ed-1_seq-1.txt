Will be Made Soon. But L YNot Announce Whether it
Will be a Strengthening of P. it Line or Changing of it
to a Shorter Route If it is Shh o New Location, Great
Difficulties will te Involved anc Advanced Detachments

Authorities that Removal of Thousands of Men Between
Columbus and Satevo Must be Accomplished Either by
Moving them Laterally Toward the East or by Returning
to the United States and Re-Entering at a New Border
Base Mexican Cattlemen Arriving at El Paso Say that
Villa Used Story of Death of Pablo Lopez, Who Died of
Wounds, to Fit Himself, and then Spread the Report as
a Ruse to tne Americans
El Paso, Texas, April 12.
That the American expedition
ary force has penetrated far be
yond Parral and is near if not
actually at the Chihuahua-Du-rango
border line, is indicated
in code dispatches received this
afternoon by private concerns.
It is said that the Americans
had a temporary base near Par
ral and toward the end of last
week, the motor trucks had de
livered supplies there. This is
the first authentic information
coming from the flying columns
in several days.
It seems certain that Villa,
if he still lives, has passed into
the mountain fastnesses of Du
rango, and that he is in posi
tion to get in touch with the
scattered bandit forces of that
district.
El Paso, Tex, April 12. Vil
la is thought by the Mexican
military authorities today to be
safely hidden in the recesses of
the Sierra Madre mountains,
while the American troops are
pursuing the rear guard of the
band of bandits, whose strate
gy is to beguile the pursuers
away from Villa's hiding place.
A Mexican cattleman arriv
ing here today said that Villa
used the story of the death of
Pablo Lopez, who died of his
wounds, to fit himself and then
spread the report as a ruse to
the Americans. The cattleman
said that Villa was near Parral.
May Change the Line.
San Antonio, Tex., April 12.
General Funston announced
today that a change will be
made soon affecting the line of
communication between Co
lumbus and Pershing's advanc
ed forces. lie declines to state
what the change was, but bar
ring the free use of the Mex
ican railroads, it is assumed
that it has been decided either
to reinforce the line materially
or shift it to a shorter route.
If the plan is shifting, it in
volves great difficulties and
some danger to the advanced
detachments. It is pointed out
that the removal of the thou
sands of men between Colum
bus and Satevo must be accom
plished either by moving them
laterally toward the east, or by
returning to the United States
and re-entering at the new bor
der base.

history, and its affairs have been eon
ducted in a manner that gives prei
tige to the lodge, and it enjoys the
friendship of the people of the city.
The Ardmore Elks have always
been generous to Ardmore people in
the use of its hall for public meet
ings and receptions when occasions

Yesterday was another day of fea
tures at the Style Show. The city,
as on previous days, entertained
many out-of-town visitors, and the
merchants had very attractive dis
plays in their .show windows.
Three excellent concerts were play
ed by the Fifth Field Artillery Band,
one in the morning, at the junction of
Main and Washington streets, and
the afternoon and evening concerts
at the tent where the automobile
show is being held. AH three con
certs were heard by large crowds
who were very generous in their
applause for the efforts of Director
Montin and his men.
The auto show was perhaps the
center of more interest yesterday
than any other feature, the classy
cars on display attracting prospective
buyers and spectators. The associa
tion deserves great credit for this
remarkable display, which would
have been much larger had weather
conditions been different the opening
days of the show.
As a special attraction the Rusl
ness Men's association lias arranged
for another concert by the band to
night at the High school auditorium,
which will be the end of the musical
program of that organization in this
city. As an added attraction, the
Fifth Artillery Glee club will sing.
The club is composed of members of
the band, and they will render solos,
quartettes and trios.
The Business Men's association de
serves a great deal of credit for tlK
manner in which it has conducted
the first annual Style Show. Not an
unpleasant feature has occurred so
far to mar the pleasure of the thou
sands of out-of-town visitors who at
tended. Today and tonight will wit
ness the end of the Style Show, and
it will come with regret to the many
visitors w ho have spent the week in
the city.
Nothing but favorable comment
was heard from any one. The show
was a revelation to the out-of-town
visitors who were not prepared to
see it carried out on such an elabo
rate pcale, and Ardmore has received
a great deal of favorable advertising
v.s the result of the efforts of the
Business Men's association. Elated
over their first effort, the officers i
and members of the association an-1
npunce that their next year's show j
will be on a more elaborate scale, ;
and w ill surpass anything of the kind1
ever given in this or adjoining states.

GERMAN ATTACKS
ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO BREAK f

Projectors, But Paris Says Attempt

Verdun Fighting Only Briefly.
In the Cuarettes wood, west of the
Meuse, another attempt to break
through the French line defending
Verdun was made by the Germans
this morning in a dashing attack witli
flame projectors. East cf the Meuse
there was no fighting during the
night, although the artillery kept up
incessant fire.
A Paris statement claims that all
of the German attacks were repulsed
and the German statement mentions
Verdun only briefly.
The British steamer Senator of
3.5C0 tons, has been sunk. The crew
is believed to have been rescued.
BAND PLAYED FOR VETERANS
Director Montin and His Men Most
Cordially Received.
Perhaps the most appreciated con
cert given by the Fifth Field Artillery
Band was that given at noon at the
Confederate Home.
Opening with southern melodies,
the old folks were doubly affected as
their old-time familiar songs were
so beautifully rendered. Especially
affected were they when the boys
sang "Old Black Joe" a,nd when Di
rector Montin played as a solo, "Su
wanee River," and when immediate
ly afterwards "Dixie" came, the
change was remarkable and spon
taneous. The climax of the concert was
when the band stood and played
"The Star Spangled Banner," an old
veteran came out with Old Glory, and
at the close of the music addressed
the. band hoys, and told them that
while once upon a time they fought
for a principle, they only recognized
one government and one (lag. Tho
band boys gave them a great cheer.
Before leaving the home the old men
and women gave rousing cheers for
the band.
The following donated cars to tak.;
the band and visitors to the home:
W. Jt. Roberts, Don I.acy, Mrs. Wal
ter Gilbert, Mrs. N. 1?. Feagin, Hal
Sprai'ins, Mrs. ( I.. Anderson, Mrs.
Dr. Olivers, Mrs. Sid I'nderwood,
Mrs. McClaine and Mr. Reeder.
While the old southern melodies
were being played, many of the aged
inmates were in tears, and it is safe
to predict that never was a more ap
preciative audiencr assembled to pay
tribute to a great band. The event
was one of the features of Style
Show Week, and will live long in the
memory of everyone present.
GREAT CROWD SEES CARNIVAL
The Great Wortham Carnival com
pany, which is showing In this city,
had a record-breaking crowd for a
carnival in this city last night. The
character of the shows attracted
some of the best people of the city,
who as a rule never attend carnival
attractions.
The Chamber of Commerce Is to be
congratulated upon securing this at
traction for the week, and if good j
weather prevails, all previous records j
for attendance will be broken. The.
shows are so far above the ordinary '
carried by carnival companies that!
there is no comparison whatever,
and every one is clean and moral.
The management has left nothing
undone for the comfort ami conveni
ence of their patrons, and deserves
the warmest commendation for thi
manner in which everything about
the grounds is conducted.
The Wortham Shows arrived In;
this city very highly complimented
by people in other cities where they i
have shown, and they are living up
to that reputation here.

MANY COME TO ADMIRE AND
LATER TO PURCHASE SHOW
DOES CREDIT TO WEEK Or
CELEBRATION.
Local sales of automobiles have
been materially boosted since the
opening of Style Show Week, and
many who went to the exposition
tent to admire the new models were
persuaded by the demonstrators in
charge that there was no time liko
the present in which to purchase
Several local sales have been re
ported, and the demonstrators from
other cities are pleased with the en
tire show. The tent, both afternoons
and evenings, is thronged with people
who come to listen to the music of
the band as well as to view the
many classy cars on display.
The Ardmore Automobile associa
tion can be justly proud of its first
effort to hold a show in this city,
and next season will see a greater
display than the present one.

players. In the three games there
Ringling won the first game by .1
score of 3 to to 1, Ringling won tho
second game by a score of 5 to 4,
and Madill won the third game by a

WILL RENUMBER CITY
BEFORE DIRECTORY CENSUS
Col. E. L. Gregory of the Ardmore
Statesman appeared before the city
commissioners last night asking them
to get the houses of the city renum
bered before the census taking of the
new directory begins. The commis
sioners decided several months ago
to have the houses of the city re-numbered
and have purchased the numbers
to go on the houses. They een secured
two men to take charge of the renum
bering a week ago, but the director of
the work secured a better job and quit.
Colonel Gregory is very anxious to
have the numbering done before the
compiling of the names for the direc
tory is undertaken. The city commis
sioners after deliberation appointed a
committee of three consisting of the
city engineer, the building inspector
and the fire chief, to take charge of
the renumbering of the city and to
have it done at once.
The city commissioners promised lo
buy a liberal number of the direc
tories for the different departments
of the city, believing that they should
do every thing possible to help In get
ting the new directory for the city.
