WILSON FACES
TWO COURSES
Determined Either to Put Sus

VILL FORCE AN ACCOUNTING

President Wilson Is now understood
o be wavering between two courses
f action on the submarine Issue with
lermany. One Is to take the matter
p with Congress and the other is to
mbody accumulative evidence of re
eant submarine attacks In a linal note
0 the Berlin foreign office. Both
ourses were discussed at length at

Ofclals say the President hap not
reakened in his determination to force
n accounting with Germany, but they
dd that Berlin's official disclaimer of
ssponsibility on the Sussex case and
he plea of justification for sinking
is four other ships, concerning which
Ite United States made representa
Ions, has practically forced the mat
!r back into the note-writing stage.
The possibility that diplomatic ne
Otiations may be reopened on the
'hole Issue has already relieved the
mnson somewhat, though Germany's
men resentment of President Wilson's
nplication that Its pledge to the
nited States has been violated is an
npleasant factor for the administra-I
