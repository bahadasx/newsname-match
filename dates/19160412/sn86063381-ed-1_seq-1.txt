University Professor Tells of Infan

This City.
(By Dr. Thomas Myers.)
Thirty physicians attended the
Easter meeting of the Upper Missis
sippi Valley Medical association in
Bemidji yesterday and all proclaimed
the session a most successful one, at
its completion at midnight.
The society first met at dinner at
the Hotel Markham at 8 p. m., and
while there were addressed by Dr.
Gateo ot Kenyon, candidate for the
Republican nomination for lieuten
ant governor.
The business session was held im
mediately afterward at the Commer
cial club rooms. Following the
transaction of routine business, pa
pers were read and discussed by em
inent specialists of the state
"Modern Surgical Treatment of In
fantile Paralysis" was read by Dr
Emrl S Geist, Minneapolis, assistant
protessor of orthopedic surgery of the
University of Minnesota. Dr. Geist
stated that this dread disease is pres
ent sporadically everywhere, and that
a number of cases exist some distance
south of Bemidji Every case is a
focus of infection for other people
and demands a rigid quarantine to be
instituted The cases begin like any
acute fever in children, but paralysis
soon sets in The stable fly may be
the means of spreading infection The
speaker then discussed the varieties,
cause and treatment for the resulting
paralysis He emphasized the neces
sity for absoulte prolonged rest in
bed during the early stages. Com
plete seclusion of any case from
healthy persons must be maintained,
as an epidemic of infantile paralysis
is far worse than diphtheriaf scarlet
fever or even smallpox. Of 100
cases of infantile paralysis, 95 term
inate with paralysis Some cases
may recover entirely under proper
treatment, even after two or three
years others have permanent par
alysis remaining. Recent methods of
surgical treatment of old paralysis
were taken up, particularly tendon
and muscle transplantation, and the
proper application of braces. Lan
tern slides demonstrated interesting
results
"Some Methods of Study of the
Heart" was read by Dr. Henry L. Ul
rich, Minneapolis, instructor in med
icine, University of Minnesota. The
talk was illustrated by lantern slides
showing graphic records of heart and
pulse action, by electrocardiagraphic
tracings. The electrocardiagraph is
a remarkable machine of recent in
vention, by the use of which the ex
act action of the heart in every phase
may be traced.
"Ectopic Gestation" was read by
Dr. Theodore Bratrud of Warren,
Minn An interesting discussion of
the subject was held, led by Dr. R.
Gilmore
"A New Means of Entering the An
trum of HIghmore for Drainage" was
read by Charles F. Coulter of Wa
dena. He also demonstrated instru
ments designed especially for this
operation.
International Falls was selected as
the place of meeting in July, and af
ter transaction of routine business,
the meeting adjourned.

WARRANTS ISSUED
FOR LUMRER MILLS
IN THIS COUNTY
Oscar Arneson of State Auditor's
Office in Bemidji Investigating
Timber Frauds.
NEW SYSTEM OF MARKING
BEGUN BY AUDITOR PREUS
lumber Company at Knife River
Charged With Illegal Cutting
of Timber.
Six warrants have been issued
against individuals and firms in Bel
trami and Koochiching counties for
timber frauds and the sawmill of Mil
ler Bros, at Kelliher has been seized,
according to Oscar Arneson of the
state auditor's office, who is in Be
midji today. Mr. Arneson is investi
gating illegal timber cutting in this
district
He stated that the prosecutions of
those concerned in defrauding the
state would be pushed vigorously. It
is claimed that the state auditor's
department has conclusive evidence
of grafting by scalers through collu
sion with logging firms Several
scalers have been dismissed
To Guard Against Frauds.
State Auditor Preus has adopted
new scaling rules to guard against:
further frauds. In the future every
log taken from a state timber tract
must not only have the mark on the
end of the log showing it was taken
from state land, but must have the
bark mark. The bark mark amounts
to practically a logger's trademark,
each individual or firm necessarily
having a different design. The state,
through the state auditor, will here
after hold that wherever even so
much as a single log without a bark
mark is found in a boom or among
booms, the entire amount of timber
will be seized by the state. The pres
ence of a log failing to have such
bark mark will be considered pre
sumptive evidence of a desire to per
petrate a fraud upon the state.
Intentional Trespass,
Hereafter, whenever there is tres
pass upon state timber land the tim
ber bureau of the auditor's office will
charge intentional trespass and any
plea of unintentional trespass will not
be accepted until proven in court by
the logging interests. The state audi
tor intends to bring about vigorous
prosecution of all instances of tres
pass. This determination on his part
is predicated upon the discovery of
grafting and fraud by scalers and
stealing and fraud and collusion by
logging companies.
As a result of investigations Tues
day, Arneson commenced action
against the Alger-Smith company
which operates in the Knife River
district, charged with cutting un
marked logs. John Millen, general
manager of the company, has been re
quired to appear before the state tim
ber board in St. Paul tomorrow.
Current investigations show that
laxity of marketing and of any sem
blance of protecting the state insofar
as its logging interests are concerned
is spread over a wide territory and
has been going on for yearsnobody
can tell just how long.
Not Prosecuting Criminally.
Mr. Arneson wants it distinctly un
derstood that the state auditor's of
fice is not looking after the criminal
phase of the matter.
"That," he said, "is wholly up to
the timber board. We are seeking to
protect the state in a pecuniary way
and to obtain financial restitution
foR the abuses of the past and pres
ent. After we are through, the state
timber board may use the evidence we
collect as its members see fit. The
only criminal proceedings which we
contemplate are in the matter of tres
pass and we expect to lineup a lot
of concerns for this. We will treat
trespass on state land as a felony
and will play no favorites in the
matter. Mr. Preus is determined to
stamp out these evils if active prose
cution can do it, and I fancy that a
railroad manager, will tell what the
railroads are trying to do to help de- 1 good many heads of concerns are not
velopment. Reports by committees feeling very comfortable just at pres-
will close the program. ent."

Question Now is How Far Can the

Ambassador Gerard Transmitting
Message Giving Germany's
Attitude.
Washington, April 12.Upon the
eve of determining what action to
pursue with Germany, the adminis
tration faces the question of how far
the United States can go with the
evidence on hand. The president and
the cabinet are convinced that a Ger
man submarine sank the Sussex.
They are convinced that the sub
marines have embarked on a new
campaign of terror, violating the
rights of neutrals.

Gerard is transmitting a long per

report of Germany's attitude in the
Sussex situation. His message is ac

SCHULTZ REFUSES
NORMAL POSITION
Refuses Offer of Place Vacated by
Death of W. A. Shoemaker of
St. Cloud.
Paul, MJnjn^ April 12.With
$ fche^sFatement"o1f g.~G. Schultz, state
superintendent of education, that he
did not want the job of presidency of
the state normal school at St. Cloud,
politicians here today were frankly
unable to prophesy who would get
fihe berth. Th,e position was left
open by the death of W. A. Shoe
maker
Little doubt existed today that the
mentioning of the name of Schultz
drawing down $4,500 a year with
two years more to serve for an ap
pointive office of $3,500 a year at St.
Cloud, was more or less a brain
child.
Some other alleged likely timber,
with probably as much substantiation
as the Schultz bubble, included E. P.
Phillips state inspector of high
schools and C. H. Barnes, state in
spector of graded schools. Both of
these men are now subordinates to
Schultz in office.
Conservatives about the capitol to
day were inclined to look upon Miss
Isabelle Lawrence as a possible suc
cessor. Since Shoemaker's death she
has been doing his work.
FORMER SALOON MEN

A meeting of former Bemidji sa
loon keepers was held today to con

tested against the city returning of
the license moneys.

BATTLE FOUGHT AT PARRAL
PARTICIPANTS ARE UNKNOWN
Death Probable as There it Only One
Doctor in Country Where
Chief Now Is.
El Paso, April 12.A battle is re
ported being fought between Jimines
and Parral. On account of Carranza
censorship the participants are not
known.
El Paso, April 12.The pursuit of
Villa probably will be brought to a
definite conclusion within 48 hours
according to information received
here by an American mining con
cern with large interests at Parral
and Torreon.
The messages received stated that
the report that Villa was dead was
current throughout southern Chihua
hua and northern Durango and while
it was still far from confirmed, it was
expressed that definite views would
be received within the next few
days
There are only two possibilities
which are accepted here as true in
the present situation: Either Fran
cisco Villa is dead and his pursuit is
automatically ended or he is far to
the south in Central Durango. If
the latter is true, army officers say
that the entire plan of campaign of
General Pershing must be completely
reorganized or abandoned altogether.
The report of Villa's death was ac
cepted as highly probable by General
Bertani, the Carranza commander at
Casas Grandes who is now in Juarez.
"There is only one doctor in the
country where Villa now is," said
General Bertani, "and if blood poison
ing has set in in Villa's wounded leg,
as my information has it, the doctor
can do nothing even if he had a
chance."
General Bertani saW that VUla h*d

ness, D. W. Griffith, Mack Sennet
and Thomas H. Ince. Griffith direct
ed "The Birth of a Nation" and is
reported to be earning a salary of
$100,000 a year. Sennet has prob
ably made more people laugh than
any other man in the world through
his directing of the Keystone come
dies. Ince is famous for his dramas.
Famous stars in the company are
Billie Burke, Bessie Barriscale, Lil
lian Gish, Louise Glaum, Constance
Talmadge, Mable Ntormand* H. B.

Knickerbocker theater in New York
last November at $2.00 a seat and
are still playing there.
Manager Harding is to be compli
mented on securing for Bemidji a
program of the very best features on
the market. With the late release
of Metro, Triangle and Vitagraph
plays, Bemidji theatergoers are as
sured of up-to-date entertainment.
POLICE MAKE RAIDS
