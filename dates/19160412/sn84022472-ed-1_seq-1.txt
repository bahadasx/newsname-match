Louis II. Wolter, ' 35, the
,. cigarmaker who shoVad ser
iously wounded his wife, Cora
Mashew Anies Wolter, and fa
tally shot himself last night,
, may be a bigamist, according to
information that came into the
possession of the police this af
ternoon. , Acquaintances of Wolter say
that a wife, from whom he
never was divorced, and two
v children are , in . Kalamazoo,
' Mich., and that advertisements
and letters sent broadcast
throughout, the country by his
father,' have failed to make him

"Unreasoning jealousy and,
' blind love for Cora, Wolter are'
believed to be at the bottom of
the shooting that occurred in
his apartments, f 82 Cannon
street, ;last night.
- v The i investigation jof the
quarrel has disclosed a , tale 6f
fatal fascinations that have fol
lowed the train of Cora Wolter,
': Wolter shot himself, Frank Ames
died by gas poisoning; and if tbe in
ferences in a letter found in . the
apartment ;- are indicative, another

; At St.: Vincent hospital- Wolter is
- said to be dying-. Bullets penetrated
his brain. ; Mrs. Wolter is expected to
recover. ' She has bullets in, tier back
and groin. '
--.rwigt w. Tnttle, former Senator
and New Haven attorney, denies that
Wolter had any ground for jealousy
. because of his business dealings -with

- by tbe family of 'Attorney. Tuttle to

ternoon' Woitwr- -was at home on the
top- floor of 80 Cannon street, which' la
three Sights above the street, reached
by .narrow hallways and -stairs with
' several -turns, ' - - '
Mrs. ; Cora Wolter' arrived at the
home. ' Her husband apparently had
... been writing. She saw him first..
. Suddenly he wheeled around and
N said: "I am going to get you and kill
' myself' '-- . : ' '
Mr a. Wolter was frightened. She
turned' and ran down the staircase,
' pursued by her husband, who flour-
ished a revolver. .. The. erst shot fired
: from the head of the second landings
missed her and richotted about the
r hallways, wh.ere it .was later found.
: Two other shots in rapid succession
lodged -in her left shoulder at the
back and in the -right thigh.: Mrs.
: Wolter bad reached tbe street. She
! held tbe door closed against the possi
I ble efforts of her husband to reach
her again. Meanwhile she shouted
for '," assistance. SA. fourth shot rang
I out after an interval of a few seconds
i and Mrs. Wolter knew instinctively
.that her husband had carried out bis
' ! threat of suicide for to a man who.
rushed up to aid her as she . collapsed
against the doorway she saidl "He
has killed himself.,
Subsequent investigation proved
. her assertion nearly true for Wolter
lay at, tbe foot of the second story
landing, a bullet lodged in his brain,
having penetrated near the right tem
.' pie. Mrs. Wolter was conveyed to the
emergency , hospital An a delivery
, wagon of Meigs & Co. Later she was
taken to St. Vincent's hospital where
- " .her husband followed in, the emer
gency ambulanoe. - '
Investigation by Detective Sergeant

disclosed the motive to have been in
sane jealousy and despondency over

on La Mort .Tomme (Dead Man's jHill),
the Germans are trying- Qrecover the

Callette ' Woods ; and north between
Bouaumont and Vaux."
For three days the only actions on
the east, bank, of the Meuse centered
there with the habitual preparation Jn
heavily concentrated; artillery fire,'
with a finishing touch in the form of
a couple- of hours ot-. heavy shelling
with suffocating and , tear-provoking
gas projectiles.
After a bombardment with high ex
plosives lastingr - eight' hours and the
use of gas for another Hour or two
the Germans would attack in two col

There was .no visible diminution in
their courage . and ardor; neither did
the-French show the slightest fatigue,
and the .consequence is that the un

of Verdun goes on.
Testerday the whole front, beaten

Ingots Stolen From Brass
Co.'s Consignments of
Valuable Metal.
A thief entered a freight car loaded
with copbpr ligots on the! siding of
tXnion brafic of the Bridgeport Brass
Co.. on Housatonic avenue sometime
last night. ' The door of thecar was
opened by smashing the padlock. One
of the ingots weighing 252 pounds and
valued . at $?5 was stolen. Another
ingot was found in the roadway near
the car. The burglar was apparently
frightened away from the scene.
The car was loaded with a consign
ment of approximately 1,000 copper
ingots to .the , Bridgeport Brass Co.,
and . were . shipped from the. copper
country on .Lake Suerior. The. car
tload of coper was worth J75, 000, ac
cording to officials of the Brass. po.
The car was on a siding of the Hou
satonic railroad outside the yards of
the Brass Co. 'A gang' of men were
unloading the consignment yesterday.
When work stopped for the day the
door -of the car was securely locked.
The watchman of the factory passed
the -car every hour during the night.
He said he saw no suspicious person
about the car during the night.
It is the belief of the police that
the burglary was the work of one man
and that , he was endeavoring ttf caN
ry 'away two ingoTs when he : was
frightened, possibly by the approach
of the watchman.- They believe ., he
dropped onexof the ingots in his hur
ry, to escape. The car is syil half
stocked with ingots and an inventory
of the consignment taken by the of
ficials of the brass company ' this
morning shows that only one ingot Is

At Naval Policies
Washington, April 12 Lack of log

American navy was deplored by Rear
Admiral Bradley A. Fiske, U. S. N.,
in a paper, "Naval Strategy" present
ed at today's session of the annual
convention of the Navy League of the
United States.
The admiral did not appear in per
son, his paper being read by a dele
gate. "In the elementary parts of the
naval professional," said the paper,
"we do very well; but in the higher
branches, particularly of strategy, we
have little clear conception. In Ger
many the. development of the navy
has been strictly along the lines of a
method carefully devised beforehand-,
in our country no method, at least, no
logical method, whatever is apparent."
