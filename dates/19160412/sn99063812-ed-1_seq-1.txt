WASHINGTON, D. C, April 12.
Keplylug to America's protest, Eng
land declares that the Germans seized
from tho American liner China, flying
tho American flag, were engaged in
other than neutral service, and were
at tho time of capture engaged In
shifting their base of operations from
Shanghai to Manila.
England contends that she bad a
right to sleze these men, even though
they wero not actually with -the ene
my flKhters. The note. It Is reliably
learned, says that German residents
ar Shanchal were enraeed in a col
lection of arms and ammunition to be
fused In stirring up a revolt In India,
and possibly for arming German com
merce raiders.
As a result, England contends,
these men nave forfeited their right
to protection under a neutral flag.
The administration Is considering
the Sussex situation, to determine how
far officials can go with the evidence
In hand. President Wilson and his
cabinet are convinced that the Ger
mans submarined the Sussex, and
have embarked upon a new reign of
terror, wherein they are regarding
the safety and rights of neutrals, but
they realise that conclusive proof may
bo lacking. Germany's disclaimer is
exnected today. The administration
may show Germany Its evidence, sug
gesting that discrepancies may be due
to erroneous reports on the part of
the submarine commanders, or to oth
er reason. ,,
It was again declared today that
there will be no long dickering in the
matter.

WARREN, Pa.. April 12. Ten
months ago Martin Nelson was so
hard up that he didn't care how he
got money. Shortly afterward he. was
convicted of obtaining It under false
pretenses and was Bent to Jail for six
months. The publicity caused by his
arrest led to his discovery by friends
who had good news for him.
Today Nelson was off for his old
home in Denmark to claim a legacy of
$6,000. Had he never been sent to
Jail probably he never would have
heard of the legacy. So, at least,
Danish consul declared. He said that
he had been searching for Nelson for
five years. The newspaper clipping
tMiinar of Nelson's arrest and Impris
onment in the Warren county Jail was
the first trace he got of him.
