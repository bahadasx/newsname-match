Men at Formidable De

Paris. April 12, (11:45 a. m.) The
German assault on the Verdun front
vest of the Meuse was renewed this
morning. Troops advanced on Cau
rettes wood, south of Cumieres, the
war office announced, using flame pro
jectors, but were repulsed.
East of the Meuse in the Douaumont
Vaux sector there was only artillery
fghting.
The war office says It has been con
firmed that the German losses yester
day were very heavy
Try to Get Lost Ground.
While bringing up reinforcements
to resume their attack on Le Mort
Homme, the hill of the Dead Man, the
Germans are trying to recover the
ground regained by the French in
Caillette woods and to the north be
tween Douaumont and Vaux.
The French positions there describe
an arc from a point south of Douau
mont fort to the center of the village
of Vaux and the front is a little less
than two miles In length.
For three days the only actions on
the east bank of the Meuse have
been centered there with the habitual
preparation in heavily concentrated
artillery fire, with a finishing touch in
the form of a couple of hours of heavy
shelling with suffocating and tear
provoking gas projectiles.
Is Unprecedented Carnage.
After a bombardment with high ex
plosives lasting eight hours and the
use of gas for another hour or two
the Germans would attack in two col
umns simultaneously on two flanks.
The consequence is that the unpre
cedented carnage of the battle of Ver
dun goes on.
Yesterday the whole front, beaten
by gas projectiles was overhung by
a yellowish cloud of chlorine vapor
which seemed to be uspended from
the Eky. When the cloud lifted the
Germans bounded forward seemingly
Indifferent to thick death dealing cur
tain of fire from the French artillery.
Some of them got through it but only
to find that the French had abandon
ed the first line trenches to allow the
gas cloud to dissipate.
German reinforcements were sent
up to fortify the trenches but before
they had readied the line the French
came back with an irresistible coun
ter attack and in a few minutes drove
out the Germans from the few points
where they had penetrated the
trenches.
German War Report.
Berlin. April 12, (via London, 3:38
p. ni. i German troops in the opera
tions against Verdun yesterday gained
Eome ground in Caillette woods, south
east of Fori Douaumont, according to
the oiTu ial statement issued today by
the German army headquarters. The
statement says:
"To the west of the Meuse, the
French vp'nly attacked our lines
northeast of Avocourt- On the east
ern bank of the Meuse three counter
attacks on the Ferve ridge prepared
by a very lively fire caused the enemy
severe losses without advantage.
"In Caillette wood, in spite of the
stubborn defense we gained some
ground at one or two places."
ONE RILLED WHEN
GAB TURNS OVER
Clinton, Iowa, April 12. Francis
Streets, aged 27 years, was smothered
to death by escaping gasoline, Howard
Johnson sustained two broken ribs and
Eevf-rai bruises and Thomas Hamilton
narrowly escaped injury late last night
when the automobile in which they
were returning to their homes in Ma-quokt-ta
'urned turtle about three
miles west of Clinton. All three were
in a one seated runabout, with Hamil
ton on the lap of Streets. Descending
a hill, approaching a bridge, the right
wheels o; the car ran into a ditch, the
car overturned, describing a complete
circle and landing right side up at the
bottom of the h:!i. Streets' head was
caught under a front wheel, while
Hamilton was catapulted up an embankment.
Dutch Blame
Sea Losses to
Teuton Subs
Amsterdam, (via London, April 12.)
The Dutch shipping council which
was entrusted by the government with
the official investigation into the sink
ing of the Dutch steamship Palem
bang and Tubantla, has issued the re
port of its findings.
With regard to the Palembang, the
report says in part:
"Three explosions took place. The
first was caused by the explosion at
some distance of a drifting mine
which was fired upon by a British
torpedo boat destroyer. After the ex
plosion the Palembang remained un
damaged. The second explosion was
caused by a torpedo, fired at short
range, which hit the Palembang. This
is established beyond doubt. It is
possible the torpedo was ineant for
the British destroyer but, missing it,
hit the Palembang.
"The third explosion was also a tor
pedo. The first mate of the steam
ship clearly saw its tract approaching
six lengths away on the starboard.
This torpedo was aimed at the Palem
bang, because the British torpedo
boat destroyer was then a great dis
tance away.
"The definite statements of the
crew are confirmed by the fact that
no other drifting mines were observed
and the Palembang, at the time of the
second and third explosions was mo
tionless and there was therefore no
possibility of a collision with an an
chored mine."
With regard to the Tubantia the re
port says in part:
"The ship was preparing to cast
anchor at 2:20 a. m. when she was hit
and a severe explosion took place in
the coal bunkers on the starboard
side, behind the first funnel. Witnesses
observed a streak on the water ap
proaching the Tubanita at great speed
directed at the point where the ex
plosion occurred.
"From investigations made by ex
perts it Is clearly shown that the
pieces of metal in the Tubantia's boats
come from a Schwartz-Kopf torpedo.
It Is evident that the torpedo was
meant for the Tubantia."
"WHITE WINGS" TO BE
CALLED "KHAKI KIDS"
Des Moines, la., April 12. For years
street cleaners here have appeared on
the city books as "white wings." Be
ginning today, the street commissioner
announced, the men will wear new uni
forms and will appear on the city
books as "khaki kids." He said he
thought the new title more dignified.
THE WAR TODAY
The Germans are still hammer
ing away at Terduiu Near Douau
niont, northeast of Verdun, the
crown prince threw his men In
large numbers against the French
trenches. The Germans made some
gains bnt were later driven back
by the French counter attack.
While the Doiiauniout attack
was In progress, the Germans had
not overlooked the line between
Le Mort Homme and Cumieres and
had covered the entire region with
a vigorous artillery tire, probably
preparing for another attack by in
fantry. On the eastern front the Rus
sians have stopped a big offensive
movement by the Germans In the
region of the Ikskuil bridge. The
big guns of both sides have been
active at various points.
The Husslans report continued
gains airainst the Turks in the
region of Erzerum. The Tnrks are

and are now stubbornly resisting

advance Into their territory.
In Caurcttes wood, just west of
the Meuse river another nttemptto

Verdnn vias made this morning by
German troops. Paris says the at
tack was repulsed. Fast of the
river the artillery kept up its In
cessant tire.
The official French statement
says the German losses in yester
day's liglitinor were very heavy.
Press dispatches from Paris give
praise to the German soldiers who
after nearly two months of lighting
ticrcely keep up the stniegle with
no visible diminution of courage
and ardor.
After a winter of inactivity along

Torreon, Mexico. April 12-The
do facto troops under General Ig
naclo Ramos are reported to have
defeated Villa bandits in an en
gagement at Sierra Mojada. The
bandits' leader, I. D. Labarra, was
captured and executed, and his
body was exposed to public view
at Sierra Mojada and F.scalnn.
The bandit leader Machado was
killed in a quarrel near 'apimi,
it is reported,
Torreon, Mexico, April 11, via El
Paso Junction, April 12. Details of a
five-hour battle between, the Carranza
garrison at Pasaje, Durango, and an
attacking force composed of Contre-
ras ana cenlceros bandits were
brought here today. The outlaws fled
in disorder into the hills of the Nazas
district after losing 70 killed, It is re
ported. The de facto troops had four
dead.
The battle took place on Sunday.
First reports were that the attacking
force was commanded by General Ca-
nuto Reyes.
As negotiations have beenifnaer"
way for the surrender of General
Reyes under an amnesty grant, bit
ter disappointment was expressed by
Carranza officials. The surrender of
Reyes was expected to seriously crip
pie the Villa cause in the neighbor
hood of Torreon and Durango.
Death Rumor Only a Trick.
El Paso, Tex., April 12. Masking his
trail with the deluding fiction spread
broadcast by Mexican peons that he is
dead of his wounds, Francisco Villa is
thought by Mexican military officers in
Juarez to be safely hidden away in the
sheltering recesses of the Sierra Madre
mountains while the American cav
alry are pursuing a rear guard band
of Villa bandits, whose strategy is to
beguile Villa's pursuers away from the
hiding place of their chief.
Mexican followers of, Villa In other
campaigns say it was a favorite trick
of Villa when the chase became hot for
the iandit to have tne story spread
that he was dead, that the ardor of his
pursuers might be dampened.
Pershing Has New Base.
Brigadier General Pershing has es
tablished a new base at Satevo, ac
cording to information here but no
word has come from the flying columns
of American cavalry under command
of Colonels Dodd and Brown, whose
pursuit of the Villa forces is said to
extend beyond Parral.
There is nothing official to confirm
a report that American troops killed a
number of Villa bandits last Saturday
south of Satevo.
Supplies in increasing quantities
are being steadily forwarded by the
quartermaster's department to Casas
Grandes, Namlquipa and other points.
Villa's Death Disputed.
An entirely new version of the story
of Villa's death was brought here to
day by a Mexican cattle man, who
claimed to have suffered a visitation
from a band of Villistas on his ranch
near Bachiniha. This man said Villa
was neither dead nor wounded but
that Pablo Lopez,, the bandit's notor
ious lieutenant and executioner in
chief, had died and that Villa had de
liberately used his death as the basis
of the story of his own finish.
The Mexican who told this story is
well known to several Americans here
who considered him reliable.
Bandits Terrorize People.
Villa's ride south has been a dis
astrous one for the villages and the
small towns through which he has
raided, according to numerous re
ports received here. His men have
looted at will and have been ruthless
in their destruction of property. Sev
eral reports relate instances of wo
men being outraged and of Mexicans
who were shot because of their sup
posed friendliness to Americans, but
none of them has been corroborated.

persons were killed, a workman and
two children, when the plant of the
DuPont Powder company at Nemours,
Mercer county, eight miles from here, '

home near the powder. The principal
damage was done by the first explo
sion which is said to have completely

DAVIS SUCCUMBS
JToted American Writer Is Victim of
Heart Trouble Had an Inter
esting Career.
Mount Klsco, N. Y., April 12. Rich
ard Harding Davis, a writer and war
correspondent died at his home here
last night from heart trouble. His
body was found early this morning and
he had apparently been stricken while
at his telephone.
He had gone into his library to dic
tate a telegram to a friend in New
York city. His wife assumed, when he
did not return, that he had decided to
read and did not visit the library until
after midnight
Mr. Davis had been in failing health
for some time and had sought quiet at
his country place, Cross Roads farms,
under the care of his wife, who was
Bessie McCoy, the actress.
One of the most popular of Amer
ican writers, a playwright also, and a
veteran of five wars, he was born in
Philadelphia in 1864.
After being educated at Lehigh and
Johns Hopkins universities, Mr. Davis
entered journalism starting with the

BERLIN NOTE
ADMITS SUBS
SANK4SHIPS
Reply to Inquiry Tells of
Sinkings by German
Subsea Craft.
HOLD ACT IS LEGAL
Kaiser's Government Backs
Position Up With Rules
, of Warfare.
Berlin, April 12, (hy wireless U
The Associated Press from a staff
correspondent.) The German re
ply to the American note concern,
ing the damaging or sinking of
five steamships, contains the
statement that the steamers Eng.
lishman, Eagle Point, Manchester
Engineer and Berwindvale were
destroyed by German submarines.
Evidence Is presented to show
that these Tessels were torpedoed
legally in accordance with the
rules of war.
The note states that a German sub
marine torpedoed a steamship in the
vicinity of the place at which the
cross channel steamship Sussex was
damaged by an explosion but that evi
dence at hand indicates that the ves
sel torpedoed by the submarine was
not the Sussex.
Dodge Sussex Case.
In regard to the Sussex, the note
states that only one German subma
rine was in the vicinity and that it
torpedoed one steamship. The com
mander of the submarine made a
6ketch at the time. This sketch has
been compared with a photograph of
the Sussex and has been found to be
quite dissimilar in build, arrangement
of stacks, etc. Therefore it Is pre
sumed a mine was responsible for the
damaging of the Sussex. In the way
of corroboration it is stated that Ger
man naval forces destroyed 26 float
ing mines on that day.
Boats Warned, Claim.
Regarding the cases of the English
man, Manchester Engineer, Eagle
Point and Berwindvale, it is stated
they were signaled to halt but dis
regarded the signals. Thereupon
warning shots were fired.
The statement is made that the
submarine commanders assured them
selves before sinking the ships that
their destruction was justified and
that the crews were safely in boats, no
man being left aboard the vessels.
.Survivor Makes Statement.
Interesting commentary on tho
theory that the Sussex explosion was
caused by a mine is furnished by a
statement of a Swiss passenger on
that vessel. According to the version
of his statement given to The Asso
ciated Press he asserts he is con
vinced a mine was responsible and so
stated after the disaster. Investigating
officers, according to this version
"bullyragged" him into changing his
statement which he now repudiates.
Washington Undecided.
Washington, April 12. Germany's
explanation of the destruction of tho
four freight ships is regarded here as
advancing the submarine controversy
another step but bringing it no near
er a point of action by the United
States.
The admission that a submarine was
in the vicinity of the Sussex Is re
garded as an important development.
The statement that the vessel was
not the Sussex Is regarded as leaving
room for developments.
