WHY THE INITIATIVE
AMENDMENT TO STATE
CONSTITUTION NOT OP­
No offer is empowered to place
a proposed amendment on ballot.
No provision is made by which
the law is made self-operative—
as is the case with the statutory
initiative referendum features.
TJieqe proposition were palled to
the at't&Vtion of The Public today by
Robt. EUakempre, city commissioner
and, Winermember of the state legis­
lature, and who, during his term of
service in that assembly, devoted no
little attention to the initiative and
referendum proposition.
Mr. Blakemore makes the following
points to bear out his contention that
no initiatory movement can be pre­
sented to the people at this time.
Intent of Legislature Clear.
That the legislature intended, when
it passed the two separate initiative
and referendum acts—one applicable
to statutes and the other applicable
to the constitution—that the legis­
lature should provide maenmery to
govern an initiative movement, is
clearly indicated by a comparison of
the two measures.
The initiative and referendum as
upplieu to statutes carries the follow­
ing provision.
"This amendment shall be self
executing, but legislation may be en­
acted to facilitate its operation."
No such provision is made in the
amendment to the constitution gov­
erning the initiative of future amend
ments to the constitution.
Up to the Legislature.
Not only does the constitutional inl
tiative amendment fail to provide
for the self operative feature—but it
expressly proviues that the legisla­
ture shall provide the machinery to
make it operative.
Such provision is made in the sec'
ond article of section 202, of the con­
stitution, as amended, as follows:
"When such petition has been prop­
erly filed the proposed amendment oi
amendments shall be published as the
legislature may provide."
The 1915 legislature made no pro­
vision for such publication.
Percentage a Mere Restriction.
Again, tne constitution, as. amend­
ed, says:
"Any amendment or amendments
to this constitution may also be pro­
posed by the people by the filing with
the secretary of state, at least six
months previous to the general elec­
tion, or an initiative petition of at
least. 25 per cent of the legal votern
in each of not less than one-lialf of
the counties of the state."
The amendment does not give the
secretary of state (or anybody else)
authority to submit to a vote, any
measure u»at may be initiated on a
25 per cent vote.
The constitution simply fixes 25 per
cent as the minimum petition that
may be required by the legislature in
any measure that it might have pass­
ed to govern an initiative constitu­
tional amendment election.
That the legislature did not intend
to make the 25 per cent feature oper­
ative through the amendment only, is
illustrated by comparison, with the
provision for the referendum of sta­
tutes—a portion of the amendment re­
lating to the statutes, and which is
self-operative, as expressly provided,
being fls follows: "Any measure or
any parts, items or sections of any
(Continued on^Page Two)
NO PROVISION MADE WHEREBY THE LAW BECOMES
SELF OPERATIVE IS ONE REASON GIVEN BY A GATE
CITY SOLON. OTHER COGENT REASONS FOLLOW.
Fargo, April 11.—No constitutional amendments can be ini­
tialed by petitions under the initiative provision, voted into the
stale constitution by the people at the last general election.
New Kockford's movement for the removal of the state capi­
tal from Bismarck to New Rockt'ord, and likewise, the movement
for the resubmission of the liquor prohibition to a vote of the
people, fall by the wayside.
The failure of the last legislature to provide machinery for
the operation of the initiative power as applied to the constitu­
tion, is responsible for the fact that the constitution is immune
from amendment, at this time, so far as movements initiated by
the people arc concerned.
ERATIVE AT PRESENT
Under the initiative amendment
as applied to the constitution,
these features stand out:
The law does, not fix a rpethod
of filing the petitions.
The law does not fix the per­
centage of voters that must be
signed up.
No provision is made for pub­
lication of proposed amendments.
'No state official is empowered
or directed to perform any act in
connection with Vie initiation of
arv amendment.

WANTS A COMMISSION
TO INVESTIGATE MATTERS
Washington, April 11.—Three fund­
amental steps which he declared were
essential to an auequate American
naval and military policy were out­
lined here today to the annual con­
vention of the navy league of the
United States by its chairman Perry
Belmont. They were creation of a
council of national defense, abolition
of the volunteer system and issuance
of national defense bonds. ~ther
speakers made pleas for prepared­
ness and manufacture of war muni­
tion.
Unfair to Congress.
Mr. Belmont contended it was un­
fair to congress to thrust upon it the
problem of defense without a com­
mission necessary to gather informa­
tion for legislation. Tne present vol­
unteer system he said would inter­
fere with industry by drawing from all
trades and caning. He argued that
defense bonds should be issued and
so extended that no one generation
would have to bear the whole burden.
Sell All You Can.
Continued unrestricted sale of war
munitions to belligerents and private
manufacture for American needs
were urged by Charles Noble Greg­
ory, dean of George Washington law
school.
"The ability of a peaceful commer­
cial state to exchange freely her
wealth for war supplies in the world's
market is her one great defense and
her one chief bulwark, he said.
Charles Martindale of Indiana ad­
vocated compulsory military service.
He declared the peopie of the United
States might vote for it, if the issues
were put to them. A deep impres­
sion had been created in this country,
he said, by failure of the volunteer
system in Great" Britain.
Need A Navy.
William H. Stayton of Nc.w York
declared a big navy was needed to
protect both coasts at the same time,
as the Panama canal could be made
useless by a few pounds of dynamite.
Bishop N. McCormick of Grand Kap
ids said peace could be best preserv­
ed through adequate preparedness.
Mil ENLISTED
MEN IK U.S. HAW
Washington, April 11.—More enlist­
ed men are in active service in the
navy now than ever before in the
country's history. Secretary Daniels
announced tonight that the entire per­
sonnel for the first time had reached
the 54,000 mark.
"There are now 54,011 men in the
enlisted personnel," said the secre­
tary, "showing a net gain of 6,664
since March 4, 1913."

London, April 11.—The armies of

sive against the French. Having de­
livered an attack along the line from
Le Moit Homme to Cumieres which
netted them a few small portion!* of
French trenches on the east of Le
Mort. Homme, the German command­
ers rested their infantry here, but in
the region of Douaumont-Vaux, north
cast of Verdun, made three-attacks
in large numbers against the iFrench
trenches. Here again they met with
success, but for only a short period
of time, for the French, in a counter
attack, drove the invaders from ad­
vance sections of trenches they had
captured and in the operation took

was in progress the Germans had
not overlooked the line between Le
Mort Homme and Cumieres and cov­
ered the entire region with an intense
artillery fire, probably preparing for
another attack by infantry. In one
of the districts on the Aisne, the
French guns caused serious German
losses.
Russians Block Attack.
In the Russian theatre, an attempt
by the Germans to take the offensive
in the region of Ikskull bridgehead
was stopped by the Russians. The
big guns on both sides have been
busy at various points elsewhere
along the front.
Petrograd reports that the Russians
are continuing to gain ground against
the Turks in the region of Erzerum.
Austrians' New Guns.
The Austrians, between the Adige
and Sugana valley, have brought into
the campaign artillery which is de­
scribed by Rome as new and very
powerful.
The Italian guns, however, have re­
plied effectively to their fire. No in­
fantry attacks are reported in this
theatre of war.
German Reply Here.
The German reply to the inquiry of
the American government, respecting
the disaster to the channel steamer,
•Sussex, now is in the hands of the
American ambassador at Berlin for
transmission to Washington. Ger­
many denies all responsibility.
Cabinet Discusses Situation.
Washington, April 11.—The sub­
marine issue between Germany and
the United States was discussed in
all its phases today at a meeting of
President Wilson and his cabinet.
A general outline of the future
course of the American government
is understood to have been agreed
upon, although a final decision was
postponed, pending receipt of the Ger­
man note on it's way regarding the
Sussex and other merchant ships
which have recently met disaster, and
additional evidence in the same cases
collected by American diplomats, and
due here Thursday.
Germany Denies All.
It Is known through confidential
advices from Ambassador Gerard from
Berlin thai the Germans will deny
any torpedo damaged the Sussex and
disclaim any other attacks about
which he has inquired. Consequently,
in spite of the convincing evidence in
the hands of the state department,
any Yeply probably will not deal with
any one case or group of cases.
Cut Out Arguments.
If such a communication as now is
contemplated is sent to Germany, it
will be designed to preclude the pos­
sibility of further drawn out diplo­
matic exchanges and to make it plain
that reiterated assurances and prom­
ises that international law would be
respected cannot protect the friendly
relations between the two countries,
if Illegal attacks on peaceful mer­
chantmen carrying Americans con­
tinue. It probably will include a re­
sume of all the many vessels attack­
ed from the time of the Lusitania
down to the present'.
Gathering Evidence.
The state department already had
begun the collection of evidence cov­
ering the whole history of Germany's
submarine operations. One of the

The report that Francisco Villa is
dead from blood poisoning, resulting
from the wound in tlle flRht with the

Lieutenant Dargue and E. S. Gorell,
who brought the report to Columbus,

said that the natives of southern Chi­

The Meeting Wound Up the Pre­
liminary Campaign of Non­
partisan League.
More than tOO farmers from Bur­
leigh, Mercer, Morton, Oliver and Mc­
Lean counties attended the final mass
meeting at the auiutorium yesterday
to introduce Lynn J. Frazier. the Non
Partisan league's candidate for gov­
ernor. The farmers were furnished a
meeting place free by the city ot' Bis­
marck and everything was done to
make their stay pleasant in the city.
There was only one farmer, that is
a real tiller of the soil, on the plat­
form last evening. That was Mr.
Frazier who appears to be sincere
and gives the impression of a man
who feels that he is called to lead the
fanners out of a fancied bondage.
The meeting at both the afternoon
and evening sessions was handled by
skilled platform manipulators of
strong socialistic convictions. Xo
parties were mentioned, but the argu­
ments were shop-worn, the kind 'sed
by any soap box orator in the large
cities.
Skillful Manipulators.
Under the skillful manipulation of
Rev. Ray McKaig, a Methodist min­
ister on a furlough, who is devoting
his time to organizing Granges, R. B.
Martin, another former Methodist
minister of strong socialistic convic­
tions, and O. M. Thomason. the man
who writes the funny stuff for the
Leader. Mr. Thomason is also an ex
preacher. He did not divulge his
creed but said that he had also tried
his hand at law, but since has conse­
crated himseif to uplifting the far­
mer.
With the exception of McKaig and
Frazier, the platform managers are
recent arrivals in the state, having
been connected with the Socialist and
I. W. W. propaganda in the state c..
Washington.
The meeting in Bismarck wound up
a preliminary campaign that includ­
ed Devils Lake, Grand Forks, Willis
ton, Minot, Valley City and Beach.
At each of these places meetings
similar to the one here were held.
That considerable success at organi­
zation has been made is evident, but
the farmers are not still convinced
that they arc being served with so­
cialistic doctrine of the worst type.
Appeal to Class Prejudice.
Not an opportunity is lost to appeal
to class prejudice and the platform
managers, sleek gentleman, who nev­
er held a plough, are having the time
of their lives farming the farmers.
It is probably the first time on rec­
ord when a considerable number of
hard headed farmers have been in­
duced to pay nine dollars for the priv­
ilege of being told how to vote.
Townley a Socialist Leader.
The meeting opened this afternoon
with the appearance of A. C. Town
ley, late of Beach, and well known on
the slope, who is the tool selected by
the Washington socialists to float
their organization.
He made the characteristic speech
appealing to class prejudice, pictur­
ing the farmer as oppressed, tricked
and fooled on ery side. Some of
