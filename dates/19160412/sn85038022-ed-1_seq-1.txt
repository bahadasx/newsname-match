CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
Makes Another Slop To the front Hy
Issuing n Ilullctln Called
"(Jrcnter Mnysillle.
Tho Maysvillo Chamber of Commerce
Is keeping on tho Job all tho time.
Their latest step is to publish n bul
letin called "Creator Alaysvlllc,"
which tells Just what Is being accom
plished by tho organization. Tho first
number was Issued on Monday nnd n
copy was mnlled to ovcry member.
Following nro a fow of tho timely
articles in this Issue:
"Much work has recently been done
bv tho cood roads division of tho
Chamber of Commerce, with tho rc
suit that the Mason County Fiscal
Court has created a road commission
to havo cntlro control of all funds for
road building that may bo created by
tho Issuanco of road bonds, If such nro
voted at an election which Is to bo hold
nt an early date. Tho bond Issue Is to
bo $400,000, of which amount, under
tho law. tho stato pays back to tho
county one-half, or $200,000."
"Tho subscription being raised for
tho baseball club is going along nice
ly nnd a substantial sum tins already
been raised, though the cntlro amount
Is not quite mado up. Wo havo been
informed that an opinion provnlled in
many quarters that tho Maysvillo
Chamber of Commcrco was going to
contribute a part of its funds to the
baseball club; howovcr, this is en
tirely false, for at no time has any
such action been suggested or con
sldcrcd, nnd neither will It bo con
sldcrcd at any futuro time. Tho
Chamber goes on record through its
board of directors as In favor of tho
baseball club and they urgo tho pco
pio of Maysvillo to give good support
to tho baseball club and to subscribe
if they can to tho fund now being
raised."
"At a meeting of tho board of direc
tors last Friday ,among other matters
given attention wns that of tho city
ordinance restricting the speed of C.
& O. trains through the city. The
board voted unanimously in favor of
recommending to our city council
early relief to tho railway company
from this slx-mllo an hour limit nnd
further recommends to the city coun
cil that they enact a new ordinance
placing the speed limit nt twenty miles
an hour for passenger trains nnd fif
teen miles an hour for freight trains.
It can be easily proved that the six-
mllo an hour limit Is now costing the
C. & O. moro than $50 per day extra
in wages alone to Its trainmen.
NEW BUSINESS ENTERPRISE.
The Charles H. Browne Company,
manufacturers of salted peanuts, pop
corn specialties and Saratoga chips
will bo open to the public In a few
days on West Second street in the
second story of tho building now oc
cupied by Martin's lunch room. Mr.
Charles Browne, manager, says that
the now concern will cater only to
tho wholesale trado and will endeavor
to glvo the pcoplo of Maysvillo some
thing now In this kind of goods. The
now plant is thoroughly equipped
with modern mnchlncry nnd is ready
to turn out an unlimited supply of
goods of this order. Tho rooms to be
occupied by the new firm havo been
thoroughly overhauled and repainted
nnd everything is in a perfectly san
itary condition.
