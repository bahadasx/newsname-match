county Conventions assemble
in various county
seats on may 1.
Columbia, April 10.?Special: In
with the Drimarv law
passed by the General Assembly at
its session in 1915 the Democratic
voters of South Carolina will meet in
their respective club places on or before
the fourth Saturday in April and
elect delegates to the county conventions,
which assemble in the various
county seats on the first Monday on
May. The clubs will elect officers
and one delegate to the County Convention
for every twenty-five voters
or majority fraction thereof, based
upon the number of votes polled in
the first primary of 1914.
The clubs will also elect a member
to represent them on the county
Democratic executive committee. .
The rules governing the Democratic
party as drawn up at the State
Convention in 1914 were enacted into
law at the session of the General
Assembly in 1915. This puts it beyond
the power of the coming State
Convention to amend or modify the
existing provisions of the present
rules and regulations of the party.
However, it does not preclude adopting
additional rules and regulations
which are not in conflict with the :
statute law.
Principal Feature*.
The principal features of the law
governing organization of the clubs
for the primaries every two years
provide that each voter must sign
las full name on the club rolls. The
posonal enrollment provision is considered
one of the strongest safe
guards of the primary, and although
its adoption created strong opposition,
it is now an accepted principle
of the party and its wisdom was justified
in its workings two years ago. !
The county convention will meet ;
at noon on the first Monday in May
at the various county seats and or- i
ganize, elect the county chairman,
choose delegates to the State Conven- !
tion and elect a member of the State j
Democratic executive committee. The ;
county conventions will also transact
soch other matters as might be of i
interest to the various counties.
Each county is entitled to twice as
many delegates as it has representa- 1
tion in the General Asembly. 1
The Democratic State Convention ;
-will meet in the hall of the House of <
Representatives at noon on Wednes- i
day, May 17. It will be called to order
by John Gary Evans, chairman |
of Ike State Democratic executive :
committee. The Convention will be ;
composed of 336 delegates.
Business of Convention.
The main business before the Con- ,
ention will be the election of four ,
delegates at laree to the National
Democratic Convention in St. Louis, .
the election of a member of the Na- J
tion&F Democratic executive commit- ,
tee, a position now held by United
States Senator B. R. Tillman, the J
election of a State chairman, now j
heM by former Governor John Gary
Evans, and the making of such rules ]
and regulations governing the party
primaries and the conduct *of the
campaign as it may see fit.
The delegates from the various
Congressional districts will caucus
during the day and elect two delegates
from each district to the St.
Lotris Convention. This will give
South Carolina 18 votes in the national
Democratic gathering.
The fight to abolish the county-tocounty
canvass of the candidates will
be one of the main struggles to come
before the State Convention. If the
canvass is -not abolished there is every
reason that it will be safeguarded
and amended. i
Complexion of "Big Four."
The complexion of the "Big Four"
to St. Louis is beginning to attract
some attention. It is customary to
send the two United States Senators
and the Governor. The names of Sen
ators Tillman and Smith, Governor'
Manning, former Governor John
Gary Evans, State Warehouse Commissioner
John L. McLaurin, former
Governor Cole L. Blease, Christie
Benet, Senator Allan Johnstone, Congressman
Lever, R. Goodwyn Rhett?,
of Charleston, president of the
Chamber of Commerce of the United
States; Solicitor Robert A. Cooper, |
former Governor M. F. Ansel, are
among those mentioned for the delegates
at large to the National Democratic
Convention.
South Carolina will undoubtedly
instract for President Woodrow Wilson
and his administration will be
heartily endorsed by the Palmetto
Democrats. As this was one of the
original Wilson States the South
Carolina Democrats will be given a
place of honor at St. Louis.
With the club meetings only two
weeks off general apathy on the part,
of the people is the outstanding fea+r"-i
n-f +J10 crpnArnl situation. The
indifference has never been more noticeable,
and it seems now as if the
organization of the clubs and the
conventions will be purely formal affairs
and there will be an entire
avoidance of anything like factional
contests or partisan proceedings.

VERMILLION CASE
I OFMUCHINTE8EST
P WHETHER COLLEGE IS CHARITABLE
INSTITUTION IS ISSUE
IN &JEW TRIAL.
A good deal of interest has been
" shown in the decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of Vermillion vs.
s Woman's College of Due West, and
n it has been stated in two or three
c papers, including The Medium, that
a the court had held that the college
d is not a charitable institution, and is
n therefore liable in tort for the
e wrongful or negligent acts of its
i- agents and servants. The reports
t are in some respects incorrect.
s The Vermillion case was tried at
- Abbeville in the fall of 1914, and
v at the conclusion of the testimony
for the plaintiff, Judge Sease
granted a non-suit on the ground
r that the defendant is a charitable
n institution and not liable for the
* negligence of its servants.. Our
d court had held in the Lindler case
l" that a charitable institution was not
e so liable, and the decision of
s Judge Sease was based on that case.
s From his decision the appeal was
e taken, mainly on two grounds: First,
0 that the testimony offered showed
s that the defendant was not a charitable
institution;
Second, that the Lindler case did
not apply for the reason that the
' wrongful acts complained of were
* the acts of the corporation itself,
and not of its agents, and that the
/ nrnnmtinn should therefore be lia
g ble, even though it was a charitable
e corporation, tie plaintiff occupying
3 a different position from the plaintiff
y in the Lindler case.
n With regard to the second objecy
tion, it is overruled, the court saying
that it is against public policy
, to hold a charitable institution liable
.[ in tort for the acts of its agents,
servants, trustees, or other parties.
y With regard to the first ground, the
e court, (Mr. Justice Gage dissenting
f and holding the non-suit proper) says
i- that it is unable to say from the
t charter of the defendant, which is all
e the evidence before the court, whethy
er the defendant is a charitable ine
stitution or not, and the case is sent
i. back for trial on this issue. Whether
d it is such a charitable institution or
? not, will be determined by the evis
dence taken and the law as declared
on the trial.

LAST FRIDAY-MANY
CASES DISPOSED OF.
TL - /~i ?. . + ?
j. nt: v^uurt 01 common jfieas Has
adjourned, all cases ready for trial
having been disposed of by Friday
afternoon. When we went to press
last week the court was engaged in
the trial of the case of Geo. Gilliam
as administrator of Whit McBride vs
Southern Railway. The case was
continued through Wednesday, and
resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff
for $850. Mess. J. Howard Moore
and Wm. N. Graydon were attorneys
for the plaintiff and J. Moore Mars
for the defendant. A motion for a
new trial was made and refused. An
appeal will be taken to the Supreme
court.
The next case tried was that of
S. 0. Young and others vs. Mrs. Mattie
Creswell and others, the same
being an action for two hundred dollars
damages for trespass on real
estate. The verdict of the jury was
iA favor of the defendant. Mess.
Graydon and Graydon represented
the plaintiff and W. H. Nicholson, of
Greenwood, and Wm. P. Greene, the
defendants.
Carrie Houston won her suit
against Mary Marshall for the right
of way leading from her property
located behind St. Jame3 A. M. E.
Church to Depot street. Wm. N.
Graydon was her attorney. D. H.
Hill was attorney for the defendant
Marshall.
The court directed a verdict for
the defendant in the cases of James
M. Bell and Claude Lanier vs. C. &
W. C. Railroad. The actions were
brought for personal injuries caused
Dy a run-away, cne mule tney were
driving being frightened by the train
of defendant. J. Frank Clinkscales
was attorney for the plaintiffs and
Wm. P. Greene for defendant.
In the case of Connor vs. Philo
Lodge K. of P., the court directed
a verdict for the plaintiff in her action
on a policy of- insurance for
$&00. She was represented by
Mess. Wm. N. Graydon and J. Frank
Clinkscales. .The defendant was
represented by N. J. Frederick, a
negro lawyer from Columbia. Frederick
was perhaps the first negro lawyer
who has practiced in the courts
of this county in fifty years, if in
fact he is not the first one at all.
He attracted a good deal of attention.
He handled his case in good
fashion, but had made an error in
his pleadings which shut him off from
the defense he sought to make in his
case. This was the last case tried.
Judge Wilson left for his home on
Saturday. His stay in Abbeville
was enjoyed by him and by the lawyers
who- practiced before him.
JUSTICE HUGHES FAVORED SON
FOR REPUBLICAN NOMINATION
Chicago, April 7.?Plans for the
national Republican Convention
which will open here June 7, were
completed here today at a meeting of
the subcommittee on arrangements
with the selection of Senator Warren
G. Harding of Ohio, for temporary
chairman.
Senator Harding was chosen for
the place by an unanimous vote on
the first formal ballot. Other convention
officers chosen were: Temporary
secretary, LaFayette B. Gleason
of New York; chief clerk, D.
Edward Monroe, of St. Louis; official
reporter, Geo. L. Hart* of Roanoke,
Va., and sergeant at arms, William
F. Stone, of Baltimore.
Many leaders here declared that
what sentiment was in their states
was in favor of Justice Hughes, although
Senator Cummins, former
Senator Burton, Charles W. Fairbanks,
Senator Sherman, and other
favorite sons had many supporters.
It was the concensus of opinion
that about 70 per cent of the delegate's
would be uninstructed.
Secretary Reynolds will open head
quarters in <jnicago to receive nouce
of contests about May 10. The subcommittee
on arrangements will not
meet again until a few days before
the convention.
KEEP QUIET RULE.
Washington, D. C., April 8.?The
campaign being begun a year ago by
Southern Railway Company for the
suppression of unnecessary noises,
likely to disturb passengers in sleeping
rnra nlaced at stations for OC
cupancy during the early hours of
the night, is to be extended and the
"KEEP QUIET" rule is to be enforced
around all passenger trains,
standing at stations or while runrunnning,
day or night.
Signals to enginemen by word of
mouth, unnecessary whistling, ringing
of bells, and escape of steam
near sleeping cars, loud talking by
crews in and about cars and on
platforms, slamming of vcstibuled
trap doors, will be eliminate as far
as posible.
The superintendents of each division
are giving personal attention to
this problem in the hope of contri
buting further to the comfort of
passengers on Southern Railway
trains.
However, a fool and his mcn.^y is
a combination you don't meet every
'day.
mlZ LOSS
? J
GERMAN CASUALTIES IN BATTLE
OF VERDUN ARE 200,000,
SAYS PARIS. J
Paris, April 7.? The German
losses before Verdun up to the present
have reached a total of 200,000
men, one of the greatest battle losses .
in the whole range of warfare, according
to semi-official estimates
made public here today?"the result
of careful inquiry made in the highest
quarters in which the .figures have
been rigorously checked and verified.
"Documentary and verbal testimony
gathered and authenticated
permit the giving of precise details
concerning the losses suffered by the
Germans and by us on the Verdun
front," saysxthe semi-official communication
given to The Associated
Press. "During the period from February
21, when the battle began, to
April 1, it is known that two army
corps, namely the third and 18th
have been withdrawn from the front
having lost in the first attacks at
least one-third of their force. They
have reappeared since and have again
suffered like losses.
"The German reinforcements are
practically used up as fast as they
are put in line. The total effectives
fU a 1 QfU AA?mo V> otto in -fVi i a Tira XT
UX U1S 1DU1 WWl.JfD iiU T v ui UUB TT u;
lost 17,000 men and the third corps
has lost 22,000 men.
"Concerning the 121st division
which took possession of North Vaux
about March 12, we have precise infromation.
More than one-half of
the seventh regiment of its reserves
was put out of action by our machine
guns in the ineffectual attack against
the slopes of the fort. The 60th reg- %
iment met similar losses, of which the
total reached 60 per cent of the regiment's
effectives.
"The 19th German infantry had already
suffered similar Iaims- in at*
tacking the village ot . Vaux March
91 Its 18th company was wiped out.
In entering the village houses, its
first battalion was reduced 60 per
-cent. I ^
l "Three regiments of the lltb Bavarian
division which led the attack
on the Malaneourt and the Avocourt
woods on March 20 and 22 were
each reduced by one-half. The same \
is true of the losses of the fourth
regiment of the second division of
land when engaged under similar
conditions.
"The foregoing are only losses during
actual attack and do not include
the losses of regiments in the
trenches or in reserve under the fire
of our cannon.
Regiment Surprised. .. .
"The 37th regiment of infantry
which was surprised by our fire while
on the march to the trenches lost
about 500 men, and from this fact
was so reduced that it could not, on
March 10, take part in the attack on
the village of Vaux, as was ordered,
| in the place of the 19th regiment,
which had been decimated by our
machine guns.
"Summarizing, during the 40 days
from February 21 to April 1, the
Germans had on the Verdun front
from-Avocourt to Eparges exactly
239 battalions of infantry, representing
a minimum of 1,076 companies
each, which gives an aggregate of
1,144 companies fully reinforced, the
companies varying from' 260 to 280
men. The assaulting army, therefore
represented at least 295,000 infantry
alone.
i "Since February 21, the reinforcements
have been frequent and heavy,
at least 80 battalions have been sent
! to the rear to be reconstituted. Others
have received their reinforcements
in the field. It is therefore,
nearly 450,000 infantry which have
appeared upon the firing line, and
" ' ?1 * lUa ntovb
tms estimate is even uiiucj. mo u*<u.n.
Prisoners' Statements.
| "Declarations gathered from prisoners
and our own observations, lead
us to estimate at least one-third of
! the total engaged as the minimum
losse3 of the German infantry up to
April 1. It is therefore, 150,000 men
who have fallen solely upon the first
battle line.
"But the German losses do not
stop there. In a modern battle, long
range guns reach behind the first
line, striking lines of communication
and the quarters of troops. As the
range of the artillery lengthens, the
zone of destruction behind the battle
line increases proportionately. The
German artillery, literally piled up
in the woods, suffered losses comparable
with those of the infantry.
Finally, our heavy artillery reached
supply camps and innumerable convoys
in the rear.
"We arrive thus, keeping within
a most moderate estimate, at upward
of 200,000 men as the figures
of our enemy's losses before Verdun."
.
IMPROVEMENTS.
I
| The Southern Railway Company
is making extensive improvements in
the grounds around its passenger
station. The landing at the point
of exit of passengers from trains is
being raised, and the grounds at the
West end of the station are being
blocked off for flower gardens, which
will 1-ia t.pnHpH hv n onmmitt-pe nf
I ladies. The walks about the station
and baggage room are being built up
with gravel, hauled from Pacolet.
The improvements will greatly beau*
tify the grounds.
