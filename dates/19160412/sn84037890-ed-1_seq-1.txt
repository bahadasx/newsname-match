VILU IS ONE DAY IN FRONT
Of Pursuers, Says Report -No
Limit Placed On Stay Of
Our Troops.
ACCURATE NEWS YET LACKING
El Paso, Tex., April 10. Confir
mation of reports that Francisco
yilla was in the neighborhood of
Parral, or had passed it, was
brought to Juarez tf-day by Gen.
Francisco Bertanl, ' the Carjanza
commander nt Madera.
General Bertanl, who came to
Juarez for a conference with his su
periors, sajd that before ho left Ma
dera Saturday authentic reports
wore received that Villa had been
seen at Camargo. This town is
about: sixty miles northeast of .Par
ral. Bertanl had no report on how
close tho American troops ware fol
lowing. The last fight between Carranza
troops and Villa forces occurred at
San Francisoo do Borja, four days
ago, the General said. The Villa
forces were defeated, leaving behind
them a number of dead and wound
ed. General Bertanl said ho had abso
lute information that Villa had been
wounded. Tho bandit was shot In
the left leg, he said, and was further
injured when his horse fell on him,
breaking' the bones of the leg.
He reported detachments of the
American forces at Santa Anna and
Natnjp,ulpa.v
Both' General GaVfra' and Gefferal
Bertanl asserted they had no knowl
edge that a limit had been placed on
the operations of American troops In
"Mexico.
"I understand, however," General
Bertanl added, "that the American
forces will be willing to withdraw. a3
soon as the Villa organizations are
thoroughly broken up."
jU Detachments of the Thirteenth
wlvalry are hard on the bandit's
trail, but no official word has como
from the front to indicate their po
sition. Mexican reports stated to
ty that Villa has a full day ahead
his pursuers. If Villa succeeds
in reaching Durango City, he prob
ably -will bo Joined by tho forces of
tho Arrieta brothers, who command
more than 1,000 men.
A statement attributed to Mexican
Consul Garcia that Villa lyis now es
caped any possibility of capture by
the Americans, having crossed a dead
line established by President Wilson
and General Carranza, beyond which
it was agreed that tho American
troops would not continue their pur
suit for tho bandit, was flatly denied
by Mr. Garcia. The Mexican consul
said, as far as he knew, no limit of
tho American pursuit had been
agreed upon.
Mexican officials here will not dis
cuss a report that tho do facto gov
ernment will soon Inform the Ameri
can Government that it is In a posi
tion to relievo the American troops
of tho task of chasing Villa.

TROUBLE GOMES TO THE
KENTUCKY REPUBLICANS
Some Delegates-At-Large Must
Play Second Fiddle at the
National Convention.
Louisville, April 8. The action
of the sub-commltteo of the Repub
lican national committee in declar
ing agaln3t double delegations, di
rectly affects the Kentucky delega
tion, as at the recent State conven
tion In Louisville eight delegates-at-large,
with half a vote each, were
chosen, Instead of four, as hereto
fore. Leading Kentucky Republicans
said here that under the national
committee's mandate the delegation-at-large
from Kentucky will have
to meet to settle among themselves
who will go to Chicago.
As a result of tho decision of the
sub-commltte of the Republican na
tional committee, according to which
a contest Is deemed to exist when
ever a State sends a "double" dele
gation to the national convention,
tho eight d,elegatcs-at-Iargo elected
at the recent Republican State con
vention either will have to settlo
among themselves which four of
them shall be delegates, or must
leave their fato with the national
convention in Juno. That is the
opinion of Alvis S. Bennett, secre
tary of tho Republican State Central
Committee, who said that tho com
mittee could do nothing in tho mat
ter with the probable exception that
it might act in an ndvlsory capacity.
Mr". Bennett said a similar situation
was encountered four years ago,
when tho delegation from the Fifth
Kentucky district sent two delegates,
with one-half voto tacb, for each
delegate entitled to a full vote. At
that time, he said, the convention
told the delegation to arrange tho
matter among themselves, which was
done by naming half of tho delegates
as real delegates and the others as
alternates. Mr. Bennett expressed
the opinion that similar action would
be taken this year unless the matter
was adjusted by tho eight men elect
ed as delegates-at-largej
The call for tho Republican na
tional convention provided for only
four dolegates from the State-at-large.
At the State convention re
cently held In Louisville by tho Re
publicans there was a bitter fight on
the floor of tho convention as to the
personnel of tho delegation from
tho State-at-large. It was decided
to name eight delegates with-half a
vote each, then it twas that tho
nogro delegates demanded two dele
gates on the delegation from tho
State-at-large. Howevor, the con
vention refused to grant tho request
of the negroes, and much bitter feel
ing was engendered among- the col
ored brothers over the State.

END OF PURSUIT
NOW
IE
But informally Denied By
Secretary Baker.
ORIGINAL 0I EXPLAINED
War Department's Plans For
Pursuing the Chase Going
Forward Actively.
PURPOSE NOT YET COMPLETED
Washington, D. C, April 9. Signs
pointed to-night to an early conclu
sion of the American expedition Into
Mexico.
Although 3ome uncertainty exist
ed as to Just what will be consider
ed n successful conclusion, there
woro Indications that the end Is near,
whether Villa Is captured or not.
However, vlthdrawal of the troops
Is not contemplated until this "suc
cess" is gained.
For the first time It was announc
ed to-day that tho original orders to
Major-General Funston did not pro
vide specially for the death or cap
ture of the bandit leader, but that
the work of the United States troopa
would "be regarded finished as soon
as Villa's band or bands are known
to be broken up," and that the
Americans would withdraw "as soon
as the do facto government of Mexi
co Is able to relieve them" of this
work."
Secretary Haker, informally deny
ing that immediate withdrawal of
the expeditionary force was contem
plated. Indicated that the War De
partment had information that the
United States troopers were close
upon Villa's trail, and that the ex
pedition might soon accomplish tho
purpose for which it was sent across
the border.
"Tho object of the expedition was
stated when it was undertaken,"
said Secrctaiy Bakr. "It has never
b?en changed. No other orders have
been given, and the expedition Is
busily pursuing Its purpose now with
what I hope Is a fair chance of early
success."
This expression from tho War Sec
retary ave rise to hopps that the
mirsuit wruld not have to bo con
tlrued much longer. Reports have
indicated tint the troops are close
tn VilK It was stated officially to
day that General Fumton's orders
waro bread enough to include deal
ing personally with th question and
that If he thought the chances of
capturing Villa were good, or that
If he believed tho death of the lead
er was necessary to "break up his
band or bands," ho would not be
hampered In the least by the War
Department.
As an ovidenco that Immediate
withdrawal was not contemplated,
Secretary Baker said that all the
War Department's plans for pursu
ing the chase were going forward
actively, an order beinc; placed only
to-day for 15 gasoline-cairylng mo
tor trucks for General Pershing's
campaign. The American forces
wero "pushing ahead." he said, but
gave no details of tho operations.
Secretary Baker said General Fun
ston had not yet reported that the
American expedition's object had
been attained. It was recalled that
on tho day tho troops crossed, Secre
tary Baker said their object wa3 to
"capturo or disperse" the bandits
who raided Columbus.
Secretary Lansing also Issued a
statement saying ho knew of no In
tention to withdraw tho troops. Ho
said also that no Intimation had
come from lhp Carrnnsia Government
hat do factor Government officials
thought General Pershing had (ac
complished his mission and should
return to United States territory.

RAILROAD USE DENIED
D. S. BY
Permission To Ship Supplies
Not Given Army, Says
Gen. Aguilar.
Queretaro, Mex., April S. The
Mexican Government has not given
the American Government permis
sion to use Mexican xallways for any
purpose whatever, said Gen. Caudido
Aguilar, Mexican Minister of For
eign Relations, after a meeting of
tho Carranza Cabinet to-day.
At the Cabinet meeting Gen. Car
ranza and his advisers discussed tho
modifications suggested by the Unit
ed States In the recent proposals for
an agreement for crossing the fron
tier between the United States and
Mexico by the armed forces of the
respective Governments. The latest
I proposals of tho Washington State
j Department were received hero yes
i tordav. hnvlnir been sent hv KIIsn,
Arredondo. Mexican Minister desig
nate to the United States.
Gen. Aguilar denied vigorously
stories published in tho American
press to the effect that the Carranza
government had given permission to
the United States army forces to uso
Mexican railways for transportation
of foodstuffs and supplies.
"Please rectify these false state
ments," said Gen. Aguilar to the As
sociated Press. "The Mexican Gov
ernment has not given tho American
Government permission to uso Mex
ican railways for any purpos? what
ever." CONVINCED DIAZ HAS
RETURNED TO MEXICO
Washington, April 8. Reports to
tho Department of Justice Indicate
that there now Is no longer any
doubt thnt Felix Diaz has landed in
Mexico. Ofllclals havo been Inform
ed that he Is at the head of a con
siderable forco In the south of Mex
ico and has received material aid
through Guatemala. It ia tho first
official Information of tho revolu
tionary leader's whereabouts.
A propaganda In his favor along
tho border between tho United
States and Mexico is reported, and a
number of his adherents there aro
under survelllanco by tho depart
ment agents.
Thus far there has been llttlo doll
nlto Information as to his move
ments or tho source from which ho
obtained arms and ammunition. It
i has been fairly well established, ofll
clals say, that he received consid
erable financial aid In New York.
One of I1I3 adherents recently wa3
traced by department agents to Can
ada and another was said to havo
left recently for Spain.
It Is considered possible that Diaz
mr.y have armed his followers In
Cuba. In this connection ofllclals
recalled to-day tho sale about a year
ago by tho United States of a quan
tity of old rlfios.
Great men have many friends
cud also many enemies.
