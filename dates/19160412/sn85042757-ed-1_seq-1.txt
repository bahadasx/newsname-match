CONTEST ON WITH A RUSH,
Many Nominations Received from All
Parts ot the County.
The p.pular subscription contest,
whim was announced in our issue of
last week, opened with a rush. We
were surprised at the interest mani
fested, but when one comes to consider
the splendid array of presents offered
it is not to be wondered at that the
ladies became active so soon.
The task is a comparatively easy one
to secure a prize for there are two
prizes lor each of the three districts
and the prizes are not only of good
quality anil stylish but are such as any
(day would admire and desire. It is
many times tne case that a cheap ot
ol prizes are offered, but that is not
the case with this contest. No effort
to describe the prizes can give you the
proper understanding of their excel
lence, you should call and see them.
One louk will convince you that there
is value of a high order in every one of
" them.
People are always glad to help these
wtio tr to help themselves and for
that rea.Nou the more active you be
come the more the public and your
friends will sympathize with you and
help you. j
We mailed over bOO extra copies of
the paper last week to persons in the
ceunty. This week we shall mail sev
eral more. In each ot the papers sent
out last week there was a free coupon
good for J.UO votes. Get every one of
those free coupons you can, Shave your
friends rill them in and bring them to
this office and have the votes counted
for you. Because of the bad weathe
we shall continue the free vote coupon
until Wednesday, April lit, at six
o'clock, n. in., instead of stopping it
today as first planned. That gives
yon a chance to get many more free
votes, if you get in the contest in ear
nest and work hard. Ti-.e kodak offer
will also be extended te Wednesday,
April 19, on account of the bad
weather.
Nothing like getting a good start.
It is mucn easier to keep ahead when
you start that way than to get in the
lead when some one has gotten the
start of you.
NUMBER OF CONTESTANTS
Tnrough oversight last week, we
failed to state that no prize will be
given in any district unless there is
more than one active contestant, but
judging from the interest shown there
is no danger of that condition arising
in an: district.
We have received many nominations
for which we are very grateful to our
friends, but the contestants wilt be
much more pleased than we, when they
see the beautiful prizes that are offer
ed. Call at this office, hear the talk
ing machine, see the diamond ring and
take a look at the three beautiful gold
Dracelet watches and diamond set la-1
velliers The watches are in gold cases
that are warranted for 20 years, 14
jewel works, Elgin movement. The
lavelliers are set with three diamonds
each and are a work of art and beauty.
Get in the contest at once and stay
to the end and you are sure to have no
cause to rtgret it.

B. Wyatt have recently purchased the

ing in the Isoline neighborhood. The
tract is known as the fluids lands and
it contains much valuable timber that

timber suitable for staves will be re
moved and the rough staves shihpped
here to be worked by John O. Burnett
& Son. After the stave timber is re
moved work will commence on the tie

worked at one time to some extent.
It will require several months to work
the tract and will furnish employment
for several hands.
TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Much to our regret we are forced to
abridge much of the news received this
week. Alter this week conditions will
be normal again we hope.
TAKEN WITH CROUP.
'A few nights ago one of mv na
trons had a child taken with croup,
writes M. T. Davis, merchant, Hears
ville, W.Va. "About midnight he came
to my store and bought a bottle of
Foley's Honey and Tar Compound.
Before morning the child was entirely
recovered." Many such letters have
been written. For sale bv Reed
Burnett.
The actual work of locating tno Dixia
Short Route was commenced Monday
when C. E. Keyes with a force of four
or five men started the preliminary lc
cation running north towards the Fen
tress county line. There will be more
than one line surveyed before the final
location is determined upon. One line
will go via Creston.
It is the purpose of the Highway
Commission to do at least a few miles
of the construction work with teama
and tools under the general direction
of C. W. Bel' as superintendent. Just
how much of such work the commission
will do chey do not know, but will do
so mucn as tney feci will be necessary
for them to get a better understanding
of the work than they or any of our
people can now pomiibly have. In other
words, it is experimental for the pur
pose ot learning so that in the event
they find it necessary later to let con
tracts tor certaia portions of the work
or for all of it for that matter -they
will be prepared to know actual cost
of the various kinds of construction,
cost of moving dirt, rock, clearing
right-of-way and all possible detaila
that they can reasonably be expected
to learn from actual experience. Their
purpose in doing this is to enable them
to know when a fair or unreasonable
price is asked by future contractors,
should there be any.
The commission also expects to be
influenced to some extent in location by
what aid the people of the various
neighborhoods will contribute to the
work.
Naturally there has been some impa
tience on the part of the public be
cause the commission did not move
more rapidly with the work. The com
mission have been aware that their
progress has been slow, but they pre
ferred to move slowly rather than to
undertake things in which they were
uninformed and have oeen for many
weeks giving much careful study and
consideration to a multitude of oiler?,
suggestions and propositions and have
Anally decided upon the plan of actu
ally doing a small portion cf the work
for such information as it will furnish
them.
No contracts have been let, no Der-
sons have been employed for any defi
nite time other than from day to day
as the commission shall see tit to keep
them employed.
Members of the commission appeared
before the county court Monday and
explained tneir attitude and the course
pursued met with the hearty approval
of the court and of all who heard what
they had to say. That our people are
wanting the roads very much there can
be no question. It is now evident that
the surest way and the quickest in for
our people to lerd all possible air to
the commission in themattei ol ngnts-of-way

desires.
It was made very plain bi I le com
mission that the question ol expense
is one that will receive the most care
ful scrunity and is tu be one of the
main features ol the work that is to
be kept down to the uiinn um.
The commission itei.-, and rightly
too, that in the linai outcome the peo
ple will approve more generally of
their course if the exercise extreme
caution in expenditure than if they
sbould do some wasteful lungs as tbe
result of undue hastt n "instruction
