PARIS, April 2. The German .iMault at 'er,luii swung tuck

through the trendies between Duuauinoiit and Vaux, northeast of the
city. The War Oil ice announce) (lie German troops advanced on Cau
rette Wood, south ol Cumieres, near Dead Man' Hill, but were re
pulsed. Plaining liquids were again used in the attack.
A terrific concentrated fire was poured in all day yesterday on the
northeastern ridge ot Dead Man's Hill where a heavy German attack
Monday night gained a foothold on the slopo. Having gained this grip
on the French second line of defense, the Crown Prince began systematic
artillery preparation for a renewal ot the assault, creating a diversion
meanwhile by attacking east of Ihe Meuse.
Following is the text of to-dnyVi
ur omen report :
"On the left bank of On ltiver

out by counter-attacks of groat
violence. Tho attack to-da was
