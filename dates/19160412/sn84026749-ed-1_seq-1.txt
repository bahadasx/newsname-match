Career an Inspiration.
Perhops no career among contem
porary .story writers has been as great
an Inspiration to "cub" reporters as
that of Richard Harding Davis.
Successful from the very outset., with
no "lean years" of waiting before the
portals of unfriendly editors, he was a
newspaper man who "arrived" at the
very outset.

years were spent in an atmosphere cal

A cablegram from General
Obregon to the Mexican em
bassy today said that, according
to his report, villa has gone into
the mountains, wounded, with
less than 160. men.
KL PA80. Tex., April U.-A battle Is
reported to have been fought between
.limine and Parral, but on account of
tho Corranxlsta censorship, the forces
engaged were not made known here to
day. A Mexican Central train ran into the
fight, later returning to Jiminez, whence
the censored reports were sent to the
border. ,
It Is not known here whether Ameri
can forces engaged In the fighting. In
formation from mining men In Parral
placed an American detachment In that
vicinity and Villista bands also were re
cently reported there. Carranza au
thorities In J u arcs are silent regarding
the battle.
Where Villa himself Is today. Is a
mystery. The, rumors of his death were
believed to have been Inspired by Mex
ican sources to bring about tho with

Funston Believes Villa
Capture Is at Hand
HAN ANTONIO. April 12.-The Amer
ican expedition today is nearer tho cap
ture of Villa than at any time since me
chare started
Tills Is tho tellef of Major General
Funston expressed Ir the face of dls
credited rumors of Villa's death, be
llevcd by army offjeers to have b.n
Insplrud by Mexican sources,
American troops nro south of Parral,
some of them believed to he over the
Durango state line, riding hard on
Villa's trail. Tho phantom Carrnnilsta,
column reported for days tn bo waiting
south of Parral in a i.lde cordon ready
to head oft Villa and force him Into a
decisive fight, has not yot materialised
in reports to hcadaunrtors.
If this Carranzlsta force Is in the
thrcc-cornero? game behind the cur
tain of tho almost Inaccessible Mexi
can country. Villa's force Is not yet
out of Immediate dknKer it Is believed,
In view of assuranco from Carranxa
commanders.
Praise for Dodd.
Funston is highly optimistic for a
quirk, successful termination of the
chase. His. messages of the past week
havo emphasized the friendliness and
co-operation of Carranza commanders.
In addltlor he has received encourag
ing reports on the physical welfare of
the expedition. Both men and horses
are In splendid condition, acconftng to
advices to headquarters.
Funston gives unstinted praise to
Colonel Dool ,for pushing his pursuit
so persistently.
Despite the handicaps of chasing the
bvidlt, in a strange country, Dodd's
caviary so far has administered one
severe defeat and kept the fugitive
Mexicans on the jump ever since the
expedition started. Just how near to
Villa's force the American cavalrymen
are todav is not definitely known, but
it I' believed that Dodd is not far be
hind th bandit. '

Falling to get from Secretary of Btats

which tho United States will probably
tako on the new submarine controversy,
Count von Uernstorff. the German am
bassador Is sold to have advised hid

on Monday far from cordial when ho
scught to "draw him out."
. Tho story golt.g the rounds of tho dip

at the Statu DeparmenU Mr. Lansing's
attitude, while polite, was frigidly form
al, and that the ambassador, wno had
hurried down to Washington from Now

department tn a decidedly resentful
mood.
In substantiation of these report?, at
tention Is being called to the fact that
the Interview lasted less than Ave min

DANIELS IS ORDERED
TO PUBLISH REPORT
5enafe Direots That Two Sup
pressed Naval Documents
Be Given Out.
Secretary Daniels today was directed
by unanimous vote of the Senate to
make public two hitherto suppressed
documents one the report of the gen
eral board In August J, 1914. and one by
Admiral FIske of November 8, 1914. The
resolution directing the reports were ln-
tioduoed by Senator Lodge.
Senator .Lodge said the general board
report wis a series of advices on the
atato of tne navy, recommendations for
bringing to this a "condition of pre
paredness," and that Flske's report was
a warning as to the unprepared condi
tion of (h navy while he was Daniel's
senior xdvlsor
Simultaneously with this action In
the Senato Henry Reuterdahl was lead
ing the members of the Navy League in
convention at the Wlllard in three
cheers for Admiral Flsk as a direct re
sult of the refusal of Secretary Daniels
ta permit Admiral Fisko to read a pa
per which tho secretary had already
approved and permitted to be publish
ed. The announcement" that Secretary
Daniels ' declined to permit the naval
orncer to reaa nis paper personally was
Interpreted by Col. Robert M. Thomp
son, president of the League, to be a
direct attempt .to prevent the Navy
League from testifying its appreciation
of Admiral Flske's services by the
zreetlnr they would give him.

Ml WILSON
QUIZZED ON
FORUM BILL
Daughter of President' Appears
Before Committee and Wins
Applause for Arguments.
SHE SETS A PRECEDENT
Urges Enactment of Measure
Authorizing Use of Schbols
by Citizens for Discusions.
Miss Margaret Wilson, the Pres
ident's daughter, appeared today
before the House District of Co
lumbia Commitce and made a
strong appeal for use of public
school buildings of Washington for
community meetings. The Board
of Education here has barred such
use.
It was the first time a President's
daughter has ever appeared bsfrrc
a Congressional committee, and
the audience of society and near
society members that turned out
was so large, the hearing had to
be held in the big caucus room.
Miss Wilson stood the quizzing
of Southern members opposed to
her measure in vigorous fashion.
She never failed to have a neat
"comeback," and frequently em
phasized her remarks by shrikjng
the table with her dqubbd Rsf. Her
replies were crisp and to the point.
She told the committee Congress
"has no business trying to tell a
community how it should conduct
itself.'1
The people themselves enjoy
that right, she insisted.
TERMED MODEL BILL. .
"Wo aer told our bill Is iniquitous on
the ground that we want the schools
fot ..ie on Sunday," said Miss Wilson.
"The people have a. ilifht to say wheth
er they shall hold community meetings
on Sundasit-iiot Cougress, nor the
Foard of Education."
Tho President's daughter was told she
should have gonu to thu Appropriations
Committco for the ULfOV ine wants as
cxH-necB for the proposed community
meetings.
"But cannot this committee authorize
H and the Appioprlctlons make It?'' she
demanded. Members admitted this Is
tiue.
The race question, said Miss Wilson,'
can settle itself. She pointed out Wash
ington liah race sepreratlon In schools"
and that colored schools could on desig
nated for colored community meetings
and white schools for white.
"This Is a model till." she contended.
"eW purpose to fauhlon theto com
munity forums after the old town meet
ings. Bach tchtol becom the capital
of a little uumr.crac. Ultimately, wo
believe thu school dlntrlcts will. become
ottng pKclnrts, since wc expect tho
States to emulate Congress In passing
similar bills."
Mr Ragsdalc, injected the race Issue,
and Mr Focht seemed to approve of
the position of the 'Board of Education
that public school buildings should not
he used for meeting places on Sunday
afternoon.
Miss Wilson, with apparent reluct
ance,, discussed the race question, and
said she did not think the law should
contain any reference to tho use of
school buildings by whlto or color fl
adu'ts. This question, she said, shoud
and would be solved by tho conlmutl-t
ties.
"I do not think tho race Issue ought
to he written Into law." was tho re
ply of Miss Wilson wIipii both Mr.
rupsdalf, nnd Mr. Focht pressed her
for an opinion.
That neither Congress nor the Board
of Education should attempt to say Dipt
a school building shall not he tired for
public discussions on Sunday afternoon
was another' unequlvocnl statement of
the President's daughter. She asserted
that the adults of the community cen
ters should determine when their meet
ings nro to be held.
"It Is suggested," she said, "that wo
have Introduced a srfocklng and Iniqui
tous bill hero because under It thes
community fonts might meet Sunday
afternoon. There Is nothing about Hun-d-iy
In the bill, and the only question
Ih whethor the Board of Education or
the majority of a community shall havn
the right to say when these meetings
are held.
Should Settle Issue.
"I think that no Democratic Congress
-I moan democratic 'with a small 'd'
will ray wo cannot uso theto buildings
on Sunday iifttrnoens. I do not think It
Is the business of Congress or the Board
of JMucutlon or anyone else to say
Ihnt tho majority of a community
nmy not gaihnr on Sunday to discuss
publlu question. I think the resi
dents of n, community xhoitld havo
overy right to ure their st-hool build
