RAILROAD MEETINGPUT ADAIR
ON THE MAP.
Last Saturday afternopn a meeting
was held in the court-house to hear
the proposition of Hon. W. G. Hunter,
of Louisville, concerning the building
ota railroad from Columbia to some
point on the L. &N. at Campbells
ville, Greensburg or between the two
places. A good number of our cit
izens were present, and sufficient in
terest shown to justify an effort to
meet the terms proposed, which are as
follows:
Dr. Hunter and associates agree to
build,.equip and put into operation a
steam line of railroad from some point
on the Greensburg branch of the L. &
N to Columbia, by January the 1st,
1917, if the people of this section will
give the right of way, survey, eta, 'and
?40,000 cash when the road Is com
pleted, and in operation Gen. James
Garnett, of Louisville, conservative in
his estimate of men, stated that he
had investigated the ability and re
sources of the parties who propose the
building of the road and that he is
convinced of their good faith and that
they are amply able to build it. Dr.
Hunter made a painstaking explana
tion, outlining his plans and giving
the name of his associates and the
reason for asking the contribution, to
which no one interested in the devel
opment and welfare of this part of the
State could object. It is a clear,
clean proposition made by parties ful
ly able to do what they agree to do,
and is submitted to the people of this
county for immediate acceptance or
rejection. The cost of securing the
right of way, surveys and organizing
expenses is the only money necessary
to be spent by our people until the
road is completed, and not a dollar of
this to be collected or used until a
contract has been made with Dr.
Hunter and associates to build the
road. Just w"hat will be needed to do
this is problematical, but certainly
will not be expensive. There is an
abundance of evidence to believe that
the right of way will be freely given
by the land owners through whose
property the road would run, and good
reason to expect substantial aid from
the people at the other end of the line
To make a long story short itis un
questionably the supreme time for the
people of Qolumbia and Adair county
to put up or shut up. There is no
time for parleys, long-winded dis
cussions and submitting other prop
ositions, for the promoter of this' en
terprise has fully and thoroughly
worked out every detail that leads to
the proposition submitted and no oth
er. We all agree that we need the
road; that it would bring rapid and
'substantial development; that we are
-able to meet the requirements, but
are we willing to do it? Failure to
lo so would" be worse than folly it
'would be business suicide. The prop
osition of Dr. Hunter appealed so
.strongly to all those who heard it,
that an organization was immediately
formed to press the work to a success
full conclusion if it can be done in the
short time given. Several thousand
dollars were pledged, and all present
indicated a hearty endorsement. Cer
tainly it would be more preferable for
some company to build a road without
any expense to the people, but for more
than a hundred years this has failed,
and this and future generations will
sossibly share a similar fate in per
suing a similar plan. The watchful
raiting policy must be abandoned in
s, or we will lose that which "we
z&f Ten days is the time limit
r us-to accept and win, or reject and
It is now time for actual field
rk and the parties, as we under
i,.have other opportunities to use
ir money ana energies. If you
it a railroad subscribe to the fund
as much as you can and join in the
work. If we all get busy the amount
can be secured in less than half the
time we have. It is the purpose to
give every citizen of Adair county an
opportunity to-assist in securing the
road, add you are urged to join in the
work at the earliest hoar possible to
raise the money necessary to secure
its building. Next Saturday at 1
o'clock, is the hour set for a report
from all the workers, and it Is hoped
that every citizen in this county in,
tecested in securing a railroad, will be
pretent, andlf the amount has not
fceea Moored at that time, to join in a
doeiag effort to make it a. certainty,
nd authorize the closing of a con
tpofcforitsbuildtog. Delay is dan
gerous. Opportunity is knocking at
our door. It's a chance of a life time,
and means so much for the industrial
development of this section, that no
man should hesitate to do all within
his power to secure it, and do' itat
once. The ten days time expires next
Tuesday, and we win or lose. A few
men can not do the work in this time.
It will take the town and the county
to make it certain
Louisville, Ky., Apr., 10 1916.
The following dispatch to C. S. Har
ris, Editor of The News, was received
late Monday afternoon: "You may
say for me that Dr. Hunter and my
self are prepared to Jgyarantee to the
people of your community who sub
scribe to the fund against losing the
sum paid for surveys and organization.
Aconstruction company will be ready
to build the road when you have se
cured the right of way, and the bonus
which your citizens are asked to do
nate in accord with the proposition
made by Dr. Hunter.
"J T. Gathright. "'
Also this message was received same
date, to the same party, from Mr S.
H. Newbold, Louisville: "I will sub
scribe 8500 to the enterprise."
$25 a Week:
Easily made by lady or gentleman;
no capital nor experience needed.
Apply: S. Stein, 1245 First,
Louisville, Ky.
If we fail to get the road you will
not lose a dollar regardless of what
you subscribe. No road, no pay. It's
a safe proposition, but the time is
short for action.
The Woodman Reel.
As had been' advertised for several
weeks, a Modern Woodmen reel was
put'on at the Parlor Circle, last Wed
nesday night. This exhibition was
for the benefit of the local Camp, and
for all others who are interested in
the order. The feature of the picture
was the showing of the Modern Wood
men Sanatorium, located at .Colorado
Springs, the patients and the man
ner of treatment of members who had
become afflicted with tuberculosis.
One patient who was in the last stage
of consumption, was shown, bidding
his wife and children, in his Missouri
home, farewell, and -leaving for the
Sanatorium. He could scarcely walk
when he left, and in nine months lie.
returned and embraced, his family, a
well man. The picture- brought- ten
der emotions to every one in the au
dience, besides it showed that the
order was doing a grand work for suf-
rering humanity. The picture was
pathetically explained by Mr. J. W.
DeHart, who is the State Manager
for the institution.
All who witnessed the exhibition
were delighted, and were also loud in
tneir praise of the grand work that is
being done by the Modern Woodmen
of America.
There is not a doubt about securing
the building of a railroad to Columbia
if we get up the money required from
the people of this county in the next
ten days.

The organization to be formed in
this county to be known as the Co
lumbia Railroad Company will have
the power and exercise the right to
locate the road. It may, and doubtless
will have a preference, as to Greens
burg or Campbelisville, or to a point
between the two, but it will decide
that at the proper time to its best in
terest. So it seems that the people of
Green and Taylor counties ought to
take notice that it will be to their in
terest not only to be friendly to the
enterprise, but active in assistance for

the other or split the difference wide
open. The factis we are forced to
discard preference forTftd'Tine.of least
resistance and .most attractive. If
you want to 'join' in get busy. If
you have no interest we'll arrange for
the connection.
Don't subscribe the smallest amount
you think you can get off with, but
put it down for the largest you can
afford to give if you want the road.
It will take a liberal subscription to
secure it.
