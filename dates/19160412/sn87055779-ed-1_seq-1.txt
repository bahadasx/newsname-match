Sen. Works Declares Move

by Judge and People.
lntern.itiaii.il Neu s Ser ie :
WASH I NGTUX, April 12. The
use of Justice Hughes' name ;ls a
candidate for the republican presi
dential nomination is oifensive not
only to him. hut to the country asi
well, Sen. Works, republican of Cal
ifornia, declared on the senate lloor
today. It should he resented both
1 y the justice and by the people, he
said.
"Partisan politics ruthless in it.-
demands ami itfvades the most
i-aored precincts of the national gov
innient. said .Sep. Works. "It is
seeking place and pelf and power
wherever and whenever it can find
ntrance. Just tiow it is attempting
to invade the supreme court of the
United States. It is presenting to a
member of that body the greatest
temptation that could be offered to
an American citizen to .surrender
bis place on the bench and become a
l;wulidate for a political office.
"This attempt to bring the highest
judicial tribunal of the country, or
any member- of it into politics,
should be resented not only by th
member to whom the tempting offer
is made, but by the whole country.
To my mind, it is of the gravest im
portance that that great tribunal
should be separat'd absolu:el- and
forever from politics, candidacy for
otfice. or any interest in elections
1 cyond that of the disinterested and
patriotic private citizen.
"If any member of the supreme
court is tempted by an offer of a
nomination as a candidate for the
presidency of the Fnited Stales am)
refuses- the offer because he is a jus
tice of the supreme ourt ami for
that reason cannot conscientiously
accept a nomination to a political
ottice or engage in politics, he will
"cave rendered his country a great
and lasting service.
"If he does that one act of unsej
hsh patriotism and devotion to the
best interests of his country that has
signally honored him it will keep m
memory greeu in the minds of his
countrymen long after the politi
cians who have thus tempted him
iTc forgotten. The use of his name
as a c andidate is an off use to him
and to the eountiv."

MstMy Atxmt arruiii-t;is.
There is considerable mystery
about the part being playe! by the
Carranza forces. All reports from
tie front say that they are very
friendly. Inf ec-pt in one instance
they have given the Americans no
help in cheeking the retreat of Villa.
Otflcers of the Cnrrunzista garri
son in Juare:? don't believe that Villa
I- dead. Basing their conclusion up
on ront information received from
the interior of Chihuahua many of
them helifve that the outlaw is not
even wounded. Or.e report re-eived
in Juarez was that Villa, had picked
the best of his troops- and wa1 rid
ing at their head as usual, leaving
the remainder to fight the Americans
or to fiee just as they avv fit.
Crops have failed in the s'ate of
Durango and the people are on th
rrire of starv ation. It is feared that
this, condition of affairs will increase
the enlistments in Villa's '.Mini, a
the Mexicans as a last resort mav be
