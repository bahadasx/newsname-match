ulong the Mexican border has lieon
reported by den. Fullarton that til io

tioned in Texas to strengthen tho
ever-lengthening line of communica
tion of the expedition seeking Villa.
Many alarming rumors have been dis
posed of and the border situation
generally ts said to be quieter than
heretofore, but tho plan is not to dis
turb the garrisons or patrol hi New
Mexico or Arizona for the present.

urday frqm Norfolk, Va., bringing the
news of the drowning of her son, Ki
nard Smith, In Honduras, March 26.
The Intelligence had been cabled to
Norfolk, 'Mrs. Smith's home. The de
lay in the news was due, it is thought
to tho fact that the deajt/h occurred tn
.th*-o?ounVi^

advil engineer, just 21 years old, and
wa? in Central America with a party

Kin a rd, Hie widow of the late Cen.
H. H. Klnard, after whom the young

the body of her son was recovered
and was buried in Honduras. Much |
sympathy ls felt for Mrs. Smith in j
this city of her birth, where she spent

monning,
The nole declares, ns previously
cabled, that thc reports of thc com
manders of submarines which might
possibly have been involved in an at
tack on the Sussex make it abso
lutely certain that the Sussex was not
destroyed by a Gorman torpedo.

sibility for the sinking of the other
steamers, evidence having been nd
duc.ed at the Investigation to show
that no blame attached to Germany.
