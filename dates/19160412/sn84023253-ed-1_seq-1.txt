TWO FASHION SHOWS
Modern Methods Adopted By Two of
St. Jolmsbury's Merchandising
Concern.-. t
For the first time St. Johnsbury la
dies had the pleasure last week of be
ing assisted in deciding on their spring
wardrobe by witnessing two fashion
shows, one at Leach and Waterman's
on Wednesday, the other at the Ready-to-Wear
shop on Wednesday and
Thursday. The Leach and Waterman
store was crowded all day Wednesdaj
and those who came were rewarded by
seeing Misses Clarissa White, Hazel
Walker and Phebo Scott wearing the
prettiest of afternoon and evening
gowns. The dresses were all drum
mer's samples and the person who
could not find something to' suit her
must have been too fussy to deserve
good clothes.
The Ready-to-Wear shop was decor
ated with flowers for the fashion show
and the company of ladles present
each day Included many from Lyn
donville as well as those from St
Johnsbury. On Wednesday the models
were Misses Beatrice Badger, Alwllda
Wells, Gertrude Menut, Gertrude Cald
beck and Harriett Weeks, Mrs. Rob
ert Nichols and Mrs. Arthur Liberty.
On Thursday Misses Haeel Walker and
Madeline Clark substituted for two
who were unable to come. Suits,
coats, afternoon and evening dresses,
sport skirts, coats and sweaters and
the daintiest of blouses were shown
at this store. The hats worn by the
.models and which added so much to
their appearance were by Mrs. Gor
don and Mrs. Folsom.

tertainment Before The Search.
Hffht Club.
The Searchlight club of the South
church, which has given the town so
many fine entertainments in the past,
again gave pleasure by arranging for
author's readings by Dorothy Canfield
Fisher of Arlington, on Friday eve
ning. The church auditorium was
fairly well filled, many coming before
eight o'clock to listen to an organ re
cital by Mrs. Joseph Fairbanks. Mrs.
Fisher has a very pleasing presence
and her simple, quiet rendering of her
own writings left a lasting impression
with her hearers. She read two un
published stories and one from her
book "Ilillsboro People." Between
the readings Miss Elizabeth Peck fav
ored the company with violin solos
with Mrs. Fairbanks as accompanist.
Mrs. Fisher gives the entire proceeds
of her readings to relief work for the
French soldiers, and the Searchlight
club will devote the proceeds of the
entertainment for war relief.
After the entertainment the Search
light club gave an informal reception
to Mrs. Fisher in the church parlor.

Catholic basis of Christian unity

those desiring to become acquainted

; tion of the Blessed Sacrament at which
service the choir of the church will
render specially prepared music. The
choir will be assisted by Miss Eliza

TRUSTEESJIEPORT
Unable To Comply With Town's
Demands But Would Elect One
School Director As A Trustee
Since the adoption of a, resolution
at the town meeting in March there
have been meetings between the mem
bers of the board of school direct
ors and the trustees of the acad
emy at which the demand of the town
through the resolution that the mem
bers of the board of school direct
ors be made members of the board
of trustees of the academy or else a
board of arbitration consisting of the
three Bchool directors and three trus
tees of the Academy and a seventh
man if necessary was discussed. These
joint meetings ended with the promise
on the part of the academy trustees
to consider the matter and report to
the school directors. They have sent
the school commissioners the follow
ing report: ..
St. Johnsbury, Vt., Apr. 8, 1916.
To the School Directors of the Town
of St. Johnsbury:
Gentlemen:
Since our joint meeting with you on
March 17th, the. Academy trustees
have twice met to consider the ques
tions raised by the resolutions adopted
at the recent annual town meeting.
They have carefully considered both
the letter and the spirit of those reso
lutions, and deem it to be their duty,
as administrators of a trust, to make
the following answer: The trustees
do not possess legal authority to grant
the request of' the town precisely in
either of the two forms embodied in
the resolution.
The first suggestion, placing the
three school directors, ex-officio, on
the board of trustees, cannot be adopt
ed in full in the terms of the resolu
tion, because of certain conditions in
the Academy charter and in the- deeds
of gift which might thereby be brok
en. A violation of these conditions
might entail a forfeiture of school
property. It is not certain that the
changes which would probably be
necessary to avoid this result could be
secured, surely not within the four
months limit named in the resolution.
Cannot Delegate Powers.
The second suggestion, a board of
arbitration, involves the submission by
the trustees and the school directors
(in the word3 of the resolution) "of
all matters and questions referring or
appertaining to St. Johnsbury Acad
emy or the public schools of St. Johns
bury," to a board of six persons, with
provision for a seventh as umpire to
break a tie. The trustees of the
Academy have not the right thus to
delegate to another board "all ques
tions appertaining to the Academy,"
and we understand that your board of
school directors recognizes the same
(Continued on page five.)
beginning Sunday evening, Apr. 30,
Father Moore will conduct a mission
in the same church for the members of
St. Aloysius parish. Masses will be
said each morning at 5:30 and 8:00
o'clock at which a short instruction
will be given. In the evening at 7:30
a sermon will be given followed by,
Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.

NOT QUESTION OF SALARY
Pres. Thomas Would Not Leave Mid
dlebury College.
Editor of The Caledonian:
There recently appeared in a Mont
pelier paper a statement which un
doubtedly formed the basis of your
editorial in your issue of last week.
The unwarranted statement that Dr.
Thomas was not elected Commissioner
of Education because he fixed a salary
of $6,000, and that the Board declined
to engage him because the State could
not pay that amount, is unjust and
entirely misleading, both so far as Dr.
Thomas and all others are concerned.
Dr. Thomas' name, among many oth
ers, was considered as a possible Com
missioner of Education.
Dr. Thomas in his loyal desire to re
main for the present as President of
Middlebury College immediately dis
couraged consideration of his name.
Neither Dr. Thomas nor the one who
approached him ever had the oppor
tunity to get down to the point of fix
ing .or naming a salary. The only
consideration was, would he accept the
position? The salary question was not
discussed save that it was thought
that if he would accept, it could be
satisfactorily arranged for all con
cerned. Dr. Thomas' reply made fur
ther consideration of this question un
necessary. I hope this statement will have wide
circulation and that the people of
Vermont will realize that financial con
siderations are oftentimes of secondary
importance. It is solely to reveal Dr.
Thomas' noble attitude in what was
done that I am glad to make this
statement as emphatic as one who
talked with him can make it.
Very truly yours,
FRANK H. BROOKS,
St. Johnsbury Vt.. Apr. 11, 1916.
HIS AGE IS AGAINST HIM
"I am 52 years old and I have been
troubled with kidneys and bladder for
a good many years," writes, Arthur
Jones, Allen, Kas. "My age is against
me to ever get cured, but Foley Kidney
Pills do me more good than anything I
ever tried." Many people suffer from
aching back, shooting pains, stiff joints,
all have been relieved, C. C. BINGHAM,

not for them he would never be able to

NEW ARMORY HERE
State Board Unanimous In Giving
Co. D, First Infantry, A New
Home-May Locate on E. Ave.
The state armory board, consisting
of Gov. Charles. W. Gates, Adjt.-Gen
Lee Tillotson and Col. Ira Reeves, has
unanimously decided to locate a state
armory for the use of Company D,
First Vermont Infantry, in St. Johns
bury. This decision was made after
a hearing at Montpelier last week
which was attended by several local
men and men from Newport and
Springfield who wanted the next
armory located in their respec
tive towns.
A state appropriation of $25,000 for
the construction of the building be
comes available on the first of July
this year. The town must furnish a
site but the state pays the entire ex
pense of the building.
It is probable that a front about 7 Ox
30 feet with a hall in the rear 60x80
feet will be constructed. The hall can
be let for other meetings and will fur
nish a large assembly hall for any
state gatherings or conventions that
may meet here. '
The location of the armory has not
been decided but it is understood that
a letter has been sent to Mrs. Walter
Husband of Washington to learn what
price she would take for the lot on
Eastern avenue that has been talked
of for a post office site. Two or three
other locations have been discussed.
When the sites are determined upon
the armory board will come and in
spect them and approve of one. Then
it will be purchased by the town and
deeded to the state. The state armory
board is ready to come as soon as there
are sites for them to Inspect.
The decision to construct an armory
here pleases everybody and especially
Capt. H. A. Wilcox who has labored so
effectively in maintaining a company
of militia here. There are now 73 men
and three officers in Co. D and 75 men
is the limit they are allowed to have.
The construction of an armory comes
at a very opportune time because the
time the company can occupy its
present quarters in the Y. M. C. A.
is limited. The 'city mission is to move
Into the Y. M. C. A. and Mr. Marshall
will have charge of the rooms in the I
building and occupy practically all of
the first floor for city mission purposes.
Capt. Wilcox received notice from
Col. Reeves last Saturday night that
the cadets at Norwich university will
go into camp from June 4th to 17th
and that the captain of each company
of the militia might appoint two men
to attend the camp and be trained in
horsemanship. The purpose of this is
to give each company men trained to
act as mounted scouts in military
work. The captain has not made his
appointments yet. The men will re
ceive regular pay and expenses the
same as if in the regular camp.
HENRY O'MALLEY PROMOTED
Former St. Johnsbury Boy Now Chief
In Washington Office
Many old friends of Henry O'Malley
will congratulate him on his new ap
pointment. He has been made chier
of the division of pisciculture of the
United States bureau of Fisheries at
Washington, the appointment being
announced last week. As the salary
which accompanies the position is
$2700 Mr. O'Malley Is to be congrat
ulated in more ways than one. He
began his work with the department
of fisheries as laborer at the local
hatchery when J. W. Titcomb was in
charge. From St. Johnsbury he was
sent to the Baker Lake, Wash., sta
tion as superintendent, was later sup
erintendent at Clackamas station,
Oregon, and more recently has , been
field superintendent for all the sta
tions on the Pacific coast.
Mr. O'Malley Is the son of Mr. and
Mrs. Patrick O'Malley, for many years
highly respected residents of Fair
banks Village, and is a graduate of
St. Johnsbury Academy.
PUT UP BIRD HOUSES
Houses Built by School Children
Placed In the Bird Haunts
Next to the pleasure of planning
and building bird-houses is that ot
putting them up. A happy company
of 30 eager children gathered at 9
a. m. Saturday to locate the best
places in popular bird-haunts where
birds might desire to secure homes.
The adventuresome boys who always
enjoy climbing were useful in ascend
ing the ladder or scaling the tree and
nailing up the houses. Each one was
put at about 20 feet from the ground
or high enough to be out of the
reach of cats and other bird enemies.
The doors were carefully turned to
the east or south to avoid the cola
northerly winds. Each one of the 20
house was named and located on a
chart so that a record may be kept of
the bird occupants and experience
gained to help learn the bird's prefer
ences and secure even better places
for another set of bird-nesting houses
another year.
The five prize winners: Philip Beck,
Russell Marshall, Raymond Skinner,
Martin Foye and Linwood Thomas
were much pleased with their valu
able prizes, several of which were
tools for making more bird-houses
and other useful things. The 10 who
received honorable mention were each
given an . illustrated pamphlet on
"Bird Houses and How to Build
Them," by Ned Dearborne, and other
literature about bird habits. .It is
hoped that the prizes may be an in-

executive committee, with power to
act, as were the. various details con
nected with the convention.
May 16, the day of the primary
election, was designated as the day
for the holding of caucuses at which
delegates to the State convention shall
be elected and a call for election" ol
town and city committees at the same
time will be issued later.
In the absence of J. Rolf Searles of
St. Johnsbury, secretary of the com
mittee, S. B. Waite of Hyde Park was

meeting.
Dcmon.stration At Goss.'
Many persons were attracted to the
C. H. Goss store last week to see the
demonstration of the Round Oak three
fuel, wood, coal and gas range. The
range, which is new to St. Johnsbury,
was explained by Miss Edwards of
Dowagiac, Mich., the home town of
the Round Oak company. She showed
the baking qualities of the range by

IMPRISONS ELECTRICITY
II. E. Perrigo, Formerly of St. JoIiiik
bury, Hat A Successful Invention.
A recent issue of the .Kansas City
Post sent to friends in town announces
that Harry E. Perrigo of that city has
perfected an Invention that captures
the wild voltage of electricity in the
air and imprisons it so it can be used
for lighting and heating purposes. lie
predicts that it will revolutionize the
electrical industry. He says all that
is necessary is to place the little air
tight box where the customary electric
light meter is placed in the home, con
nect with the lighting wires of the
house and you can get enough electric
ity to light your house without cost.
The process is not explained in the
article but it says Mr. Perrigo has been
working more than a year on the pro
ject and now has it perfected enough
for general use.
Perrigo was a former resident of St
Johnsbury.
