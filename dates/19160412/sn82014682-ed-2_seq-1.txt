" ' proximately 40 members of the Kauai
Chamber of Commerce brought to a

- One member voted In opposition to
the motion. This waa Gaylord P. Wll

t pany of Kealla. Though representatives
from all parts of the isiana were pre-

In calling: the meeting to order
fPrcsIdent William C. Avery stated
that the gathering: was made of
;- rcen or ail waits or lire upon tne uar-
tlen Island and truly representative of
the island's people, !. " - V
He assured the governor that no one
. . had any I3ea of -getting" him; that
. ' this was not the purpose of the meet-
. " Ins. , It was instead, he said, a general
: ratherinr that the wants of Kauai
might be put up to the executive. . He
then introduced the governor, who
mad a considerable address, urgin
action by a united Kauai, dwelling on
. the perplexing problems of horae-
steading In the territory, and touching
upon the conflict of large and small
' Interests. He suggested that & repre
sentative company might be formed to
handle the water situation. .?
. Broadbcnt was the first man to
speak after the governor had finished,
thanking the governor for his talk and
x for his visit to the Island. "
"I take It the governor is here for
suggestions," he said, "and that sug
gestions toward the future rather than
- recitals of the past history of thl3
Island will be Gf most value. The gov
' ernor .tas laid stress upon the fact
that the VVaipouli homesteaders need
s r water, but 1 can show him good cane
grown up there without it ,: . " -
Broadbent Su;;ests Committee. -
, "When it comes to a question of
handling water, I agree' that It should
- rot be put under a private concern,
for tho strong man WouKl be the one
In times of drought to get the advan-
- . . tage under such a plan. I suggest that
; from resident and unbiased men of
' -this Island a committee could be forc
ed to regulate the water distribution.
f . ) am convinced that such a plan could
bo worked out to give just and equit-
'- able resulta."
.. Broadbent also proposed a plan of
letting out the land- He said he did
sot believe that it should be passed
- . out In great tracts to any and all men
who came seeking It.
. "Let there be a division of the land
4 Into thfee parts, he suggested, "and
-.- let a third go to the homesteader. An
other third could go out to the planta
tion for a six-year lease, and the last
part to the plantation for a 12-year
' lease," v . .' ... ; ;
The speaker explained that at the
end of six years If homesteading was
proving a success, the second parcel
could be turned over to homesteaders.
While If it was not a success It could
be' kept by the plantation interesta,
, and homesteaders who had grown
tired of their work could pass their
land over also If they cared to do so.
' , He thought this , slow means of dis
tribution . would be - safe to all con
' " ' cerned. .-; . . '
Says Homesteading Can Be : ,
Made a Success.
"1 declare myself in the presence of
the governor rind my lellow members

steading can be made a success," said

U. S. Revenue Collector Gets
Important Decision From
; Treasury Department
MAY ADD HIINDREDS OF
-THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
Assessment tot Be Collected
"At;Source," and Local Cor-
porations Are Affected
V: S. internal Revenue offi ilals here
believe .' that hundreds of thousands
of dollars will be paid in additional
taxation by stockholders in Hawaiian
corporations as the result of a deci
sion of the treasury department re
ceived yesterday at the office of Col
lector ' of Revenue' John F. Haley. It
declares that foreign stockholders of
American corporations must hereafter
pay tbe income tax on their hqldlngs,
without tbe exemptions allowed resi
dent 'stockholders, T. H. Da vies &
Company and Hackfeld ft Company
stockholders are said at the revenue
office to be among those affected by
the new ruling. These two corpora
tions have perhaps the largest lists of
foreign stockholders. t .
The ruling wns: made after a. dec!
sicn by the supreme court of the Unit
ed States brought by a 'German stock
holder of the Union Pacific RAUwa;
Company. .: Under -It non-resident
alieaa are not entitled to the exemp
tion from taxation of the first $3000 of
their "Income, but are liable for the
tax upon the entire net income "from
all property owned, and of every busi
ness, trade or profession, carries on
in the United States," In the words
of the supreme court decision.
a- The tax is to be collected at the
source, and returns will have to be
made by the corporations paying the
interest or dividends. ; '
. The decision has . been expected fey
the internal revenue collector's office
here,-ios . many;, months v There f was
some-fear that when it did come It
would call for. the collection of the
tax from non-residents from the time
th law went Jnto effects The deci
slcn reads "effective as of January 1,
1916,", however, which means that
there will be no collection of the tax
from non-residents until, next year,
though the 1916 Incomes will be taken
Into account. ' ! l ..
