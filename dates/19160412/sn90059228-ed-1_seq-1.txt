Story of the Play.
llcni.1, 2vW'tlH.U#*\ CuTnevihe, who
,oas been since childhood, owing to
civil war, an exile, returns to his an
cestral home, on the occasion of the
great annual fair, which is being cel
ebrated in the village that receives
its name from this chateau. It is
one of the old-fashioned Norman
villages of the seventeenth century.
In the First act the curtain rises
on an assemblage of village gossips,
discussing the scandal and small talk,
Serpolette, a cross between Fanchon
and Boulotte, is the topic of con
versation among the belles of Corne
ville. She comes in, just in time to
turn the tables on the others and
changes their taunts into expressions
of rage. Gaspard, an old miser,
wishes to marry his niece, Germaine,
to the principal magistrate of the
district, the Bailli. This arrange
ment does not suit Germaine, nor a
young fisherman named Jean
Grenicheaux, who pretends that he
has saved her life from drowning on
a certain occasion. To escape from
the power of old Gaspard, Gennaine
takes advantage of the privileges of
the fair( a similar scene to that in
the first act of "Martha"), and be
comes the servent of the Marquis.
Her example is followed by
Grenicheux and Serpolette.
The Second Act is taken up with
the supernatural visitors who have
made the Castle of Corneville so long
an object of dread. Henri determines
to find out the real character of these
ghostly appearances, and discovers
^Vh&t it is all the work of the old
miser, who has concealed his treasur
es in the chateau. The discovery
drives Gaspard crazy, especially
when he hears the bells of the chat
eau ringing for the first time since
the flight of the old Marquis.
The Third Act represents the
grand fete given in honor of the re
turn of Henri to his ancestral home.
Serpolette arrives as a Marchioness,
as some papers, found in the chateau,
indicate that she is the lost heiress.
The miser, however, recovers his rea
son, and shows that Germaine is the
true Marchioness. A love duet be
tween her and Henri, and the recon
ciliation of all the parties, bring the
romantic story to a close.
The play will certainly please the
most critical audience and should re
ceive the liberal patronage it is sure
to merit.

FORD CLAIMS PEACE VICTORY.
Says His Election Majority is
dorsemenf of His Views.
En-
Detioit, Mich., April 7.Dr. Henry
Ford to-day declared the result of
Monday's presidential pi'eference pri
mary in which he defeated United
States o^nartft vVr. Aicten amith by
more than 5,000 votes was a victory
for peace rather than for himself.
He interpreted it as meaning that a
majority of Michigan voters en
dorsed his views on pi*eparedness.
He also reiterated his assertion that
he is not in politics.
"I am glad," said Mr. Ford, "be-
cause I interpret the honor as an ex
pression of a majority of the voters
that they believe as I do against
military preparedness and the expli
tation of the working man by the
monied munition interests.
"I believe that if the people urging
us to prepare get up into the state
of preparedness that they desire
will find us in a war in a short time.
The primary vote leads me to believe
that the majority of the voters in
Michigan feel the same way."
Mr. Ford at present planned to re
turn to Europe and the Ford con
gress in May.
"I don't know how much success
will attend my forthcoming trip,"
continued Mr. Ford, "but we are go
ing to continue our efforts until re
sults are so apparent that the shell
manufacturers will have a few idle
moments to look at them."
IS N. P. TO BUILD THRU
WESTERN MARSHALL CO?
A gang of Italians are working
along the N. P. tracks putting in 86
pound rails at some points. It is
rumored that this is preparatory to
the proposed bridging of the Red
river at Drayton and building a cut
off on the east side of the river to
Grand Forks. The distance would
then be shortened about 20 miles and
thus save about an hour's time bet
ween Winnipeg and the Twin Cities.
Such a cut-off would leave Forest
River, Gilby and other stations south
of Grafton on a side track and it is
quite probable that a small town and
elevators would be located across the
river from Drayton or near there.

I STEPHEN FARMER DROPS
i DEAD AT SOO DEPOT.
Was Enroute to Warren Hospital for
TreatmentSteps from Flyer
and Dies in Ten Minutes.
Elling Mickelson, aged about 60,
retired farmer residing near Stephen,
dropped dead while sitting in the Soo
depot Monday evening at 10:20 p. m.,
ten minutes after alighting from the
flyer. The man had been suffering
from stomach trouble and was to
have left the city the following
morning for Warren to receive treat
ment Shortly after the man died
Coroner Halvorson was called, who
decided that an inquest was not nec
essary.
For the past fifteen years Mr.
Mickelson had been residing on a
farm near Stephen and was engaged
in building a home at Karlstad,
where he had expected to remove his
family, when he was taken ill. Mr.
Mickelson was advised by the Karl
stad doctors to enter the hospital at
Warren, after receiving medical aid
at the former city for a few days.
Monday evening: he left Karlstad ac
companied by Paul Hendrickson. On
alighting from the flyer when it ar
rived here, Mickelson, with the as
sistance of Mr. Hendrickson, walked
to the waiting room and appeared to
be in a very weakened condition, but
was able to carry on a conversation
until one minute before his death.
Mr. Hendrickson on meeting the
Times reporter explained the condi
tion of the man as being verv low.
Dr. Heib^r, who happened to be at
the other end of the depot at that
time was called to the aid of the man
by the reporter. When the doctor
arrived he made a hasty examination
and pronounced the man dead.
The man is survived by a wife and
five children, who are left to mourn
his loss. The remains were shipped
to-day to Stephen for burialThief
River Falls Times.
THE SHIFTLESS FARMER
AND THE NON-ADVERTISER.
The farmer who plants his seed in
the ground and then lets it grow as
it will without further cultivation is
like the business man who buys a
stock of eoods, opens his doors and
io satisfied with wnat trade natural
ly drifts in. But the advertising
firm i^ like the propTessive farmer
who works in his field dav after day
and is rewarded with a big crop.
True, the shiftless farmer gets as
much per bushel for his grain as the
farmer who spends all summer in the
fieldbut he does not have as many
bushels to sell. And so it is with
the business house. The progressive
house advertises all the time and as
a result makes so many sales at a
small profit that its total gains are
far mere than the non-advertiser who
is satisfied with a few big profits on
a few scatering sales. The wise man
or women knows it pays to trade
with firms that advertise.

Green Bay, Wisconsin. He came to
Minnesota in 1878 and to Argyle in
1883, where he in partnership with

connected grew, prospered and be
came one of the best known in nor
thern Minnesota. Many years after
the business was incorporated as the
Argyle Mercantile Co., under which
name the store is conducted to-day.
As a good, sturdy citizen and as a
capable business man, Mr. Olson has
contributed much to the growth and
development of Argyle and surround
ing territory.
Mr. Olson was united in marriage
to Miss Jennie Lunde in 1880 and
from this happy union eight children

bereaved family the sympathy of the
community is extended in their home
of sorrow.
In the death of Andrew Olson,
Argyle and Marshall county has lost
one of its most unseful, public spirit
ed and beloved citizens. Peace to
his memory.
MODERN NOAH BUILDS
ARK. FEARING FLOOD.
John Rule, a farmer living on the
Red river ,south of Drayton, N. D.,
believes that the present high water
is a forerunner of a flood equal to
that described in Genesis, and has
accordingly built an ark in which he
expects to save himself and his fam
ily. A large houseboat provisioned
for 40 days has been constructed and
hauled close to the porch of his farm
house in order to provide a means
of escape from the expected high
water.
The Snake river is rising rapidly
to-day and there is some danger of
residences built on low ground being
flooded. The Red river also is re
ported very high at Oslo and threat
ens to inundate the town. Alvarado
also is experiencing some high water.
No damage, however, will be done as
the waters will recede in a few days.

TWO GIRLS TAME
PRAIRIE CHICKENS.
Two Thief River Falls girls, Geln
na and Fern Beelbauer, 16 and 18
years of age, have 24 prairie chick
ens that they have tamed. During
the cold winter months, when snow
and ice covered the ground so deeply
that it was impossible to obtain
food, the chickens came in the barn
yard. The girls fed them, and they
made their homes in a huge straw
stack.
Now they are so tame that they
come at call just like the domestic
fowl, cluster about the girls, and
even eat from their hands. The
girls are daughters of Fred Beel
hauer, a farmer living four miles
from Thief River Falls, and have
never been off the farm.
Warren Has Violin Maker.
Warren has a maker of violins in
the person of O. P. Johnson, and
some day his skill may be as justly
recognized as is that of Stradivarius
and other famous violin makers of
Cremona, in Northern Italy. Yester
day Mr. Johnson exhibited in the
Sheaf office two violins which he has
made, and as far as appearance goes
they were the equal of any instru
ments of the kind that we have ever
seen. And the tones produced when
O. A. Forde and G. N. Morkassel drew
the bows were of remarkable mellow
ness, sweetness, sonority and carry
ing power. To be able to make a
violin, that so to speak posses "a
soul" is a great art, and depending in
a large measure upon ability to sel
ect the right kind of wood for the
sounding board. A hundred years
from now Warren may be as famed
for it violins as now is Cremona, in
Italy.
