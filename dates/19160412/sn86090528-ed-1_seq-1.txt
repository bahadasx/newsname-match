NEW LIGHTS
INSTALLED
ON STREETS
Ninety-One Lamps of Modern Make are
Placed in District South of Kansas
Avenue; Incandesctnts of
400 Candle Power
Manager Schaffer, of tho Chickasha
Electric Lighting company. ' renorts
tho completion of the installation of
tho new street 'lights by his company
Several - weeks since Mr. Schaffer
appeared before the city council and
gained the consent of that body to re
place the old lights with new and
more modern lamps in order that more
satisfactory lighting might be furnish
ed to Chickasha.
Mr. Schaffer slated this morning
that 31 lamps, nitrogen-filled, each
lamp of -100 candle power, had been in
stalled in tho territory lying south of
Kansas avenue, while from' Kansas
avenue north tho ol lamps had been
replaced with "general electric mag
nitude" lamps, juach of great lighting
power.
Tho entire lighting system is so ar
ranged that the two circuits may be
thrown on at one time and instantane
ously from the power plant.
The lights in the district south of
Kansas avenue are of the very latest
model. Each 400 candle power incan
descent is encased in a ground glass
doublo globe, each globe manufactur
ed v. ii.ii heavy corrugations, those on
the inner giolie of longitudinal kind
and those of tho outer, or casing globe
running in parallels. Tho corrugations
upon the globes are so arranged as to
refr-ict the rays from the lamps in lat
eral waves, throwing tho light down
and outward.
The new lights in the general elec
tric district will require attention
from once to two times per week; the
lights in tho "incandes-mt" district
will require no attention at all further
than the replacement, from time to
time, of the lights which may have
burned out.

(Written for tho United Press.),
New York, April 12. Twenty-five!
thousand small boys slunk into the at '
tic today and got the augur out ot pa's(
tool chest. They spent most ot the
morning boring holes through, thai
wood and concrete fences surround
ing the eight biggest parks where thati
famous and well known sport, base
ball, will blossom again this afternoon.
While this has nothing to do with
the story, the fact remains that the
small boys, together with some StJir,
000 he's and she's will be on band
when eight umpires clear eight husky,
throats and bark "Play Ball" ia the
American and National Leagues thl
afternoon. '
These 200,000, having passed the age
cf boring holes in fences, will pay to
ge'. in and thus start the change pour
ing into baseball coffers at the begin
ning today of what the magnates aay4
will bo a record year.
Old Doc Prosperity, with a little)
peace dove serum, has inoculated the
fans, the magnates say, aud all are
cured of the malady that has proved
so costly for the last four years Fed-
erabtis.
Sport writer, players and just plain!
fans united with the magnates in their!
prediction that 1916 baseball will not
only drive war, Mexico and the justly,
famous petticoat fashions out of the
now-jpnii'irs and public mind, but will
stack u bank rolls that will repay old
Mr. C. B for the wads of change lost
in the conflict with the Feds.
The absence of the Federals . &
third contender, and the spirit oC
friendship that now permeates organ
ised baseball is a now factor. New'
iu-'lions are backing the game. The
Chicago Cubs-Whales have the power,
of the mail order house, the restau
rant trust in the middle west, the
packing interests and the chewing
gum trusts behind them.
And Charlie Weogham, the controll
;m factor in this combination of na
tional and federal league players, say
ho will spend much money if necessa
ry This same spirit, Weegham Bays4
is backing the other teams, though,
lone of the others could sit in a
game of freezout with Weegham.
When tho season opened today only
tli'ee teams were practically the same;
as last year tho Chicago White Sox,
the Washington Americans and the)
rhiH'c.". The others, which have re
critited new players .from the erst"
whilt. Feds, didn't look the same!
Lenay Kauff, star Fed infielder, was

again.
Along with the Cock Robins, blush'
