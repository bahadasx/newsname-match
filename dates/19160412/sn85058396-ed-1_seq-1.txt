GERMANY CLAIMS
ACTS WERE LEGAL
Sinking of Steamers English
man, Eagle Point, Manches
ter, Engineer and Ber
windale Conforms to
Rules of War.
Berlin, April 12, by wireless to Say
vllle. The German reply to tho Amer
ican note concerning the damaging
or sinking of five steamships, con
tains the statement that the steamers
Englishman, Eagle Point, Manches
ter Engineer and Berwindvale wore
destioyed by German submarines.
Evidence is presented to show that
these vessels were torpedoed legally
in accordance with the rules of war.
The note states that a German sub
marmo torpedoed a Bteamship lu tho
vicinity of the place at which tho
croBS channel steamship Sussex was
damaged by an explosion, but that
evidence at hand Indicates that the
vessel torpedoed by tho submarine
was not the Sussex.
Jn regard to the Sussex, the note
states that only one German subma
rine was in the vicinity and that it
torpeduca one steamship. The com
mander of tho submarines made a
sketch at the time. This sketch has
been compared with a photograph of
the Sussex and has been found to be
quite dissimilar in build, arrangement
of suicks, etc. Therefore, it is pre
sumed a mine was responsible for the
damaging of the Sussex. In tho way
of corroboration, it is stated that
German naval forces destroyed twenty-five
floating mines on that day.
Warning Shots Fired.
Regarding the cases of Englishman,
Manchester Engineer, Eagle Point
and Berwindvale, It is stated they
were signalled to halt but disregarded
the signals. Thereupon warning
shots were fired.
Tho statement Is made that the
submarine commanders assured them
selves before sinking the ships that
their destruction was justified and
that the crews were safe In boats.
A SwIsb passenger on the Sussex
asserted to the Associated Press he
Is convinced a mine was responsible
and that he so stated after the dis
aster. Investigating officers, he said,
"bully ragged" him into changing his
statement which he now repudiates.

SENATEDEMANDS
FISKE LETTERS
Correspondence Between Ad
miral and Secretary Daniels
Declared to Contain
Warnings of Navy's
Unpreparedness.
Washington, April 12. Secretary
Daniels' refusal to permit Rear Admir
al Fiske to read a paper before the
Navy League convention here today,
stirred up a wave of denunciation of
the secretary In the meeting and drew
hisses from one part of the hall. The
admiral's paper, previously published
in Naval Institute, an official "publi
cation of the navy war college, was
read by William Mather Lowis of
Lake Forest, Ills., while the meeting
cheered.
Secretary Daniel's Letter Read.
Colonel Robert M. Thompson, presi
dent of the league, read a letter from
Secretary Daniels denying a request
that the admiral read the paper and
declared:
"I desire to express my sorrow
that the navy department should take
this narrow view, so strongly in con
flict with that taken by the war de
partment. This question Involves
the constitutional right of free speech,
that an officer of fifty years service,
acknowledged as one of the leaders of
his profession, should be denied the
right to say that two and two make
Daniel's Name Hissed.
Colonel Thompson's mention of Sec
retary Daniels' name brought hisses
Henry Reuterdahl and William H.
Stayton of New York, attacked the
secretary's position and Routerdahl
declared "that the muzzling of naval
officers does not come directly from
the navy department but originally
from the White House." Secretary
Daniels' letter gave as a reason for
his position, tho attitude that he
thought It better for civilians to lead
the fight for enlargement of the navy
and for naval officers to continue an
unbroken policy of not trying to in
fluence legislation.
"If any here wants to defend the
secretary's position, let him arise,"
shouted Routerdahl.
No one arose to the defense of the
secretary.
Washington, April 12. Tho contro
versy between Secretary Daniels and
Rear Admiral Bradley A. FiBke, for
mer aid for operations, took a new
turn today when tho senate adopted
without discussion a resolution by
Senator Lodge calling for correspond
ence which Mr. Daniels declared to
produce before the house committee
during hearings on the naval appro
priation bill.
The resolution describes the letters
as written in November, 1914, one by
tho genoral board and one by Admiral
Flske. They are declared to contain
warnings of the unreadiness of the
navy for war.
Before the house committee tho
secretary was asked If he had not
received such letters, following his
statement that bis difference with Ad
miral Flake had not arisen over any
preparedness issue. He said commu
nications with the general board were
confidential and would not produce
the letter. Ho argued that If ho
knew members of the board were dis
cussing these confidential matters
outside tho department, he would
take steps to change its personnel.
Admiral Fiske told the same com
mittee he had resigned as aide for
operations because he differed with
Mr, Daniels over the navy's readi
ness for war.
In his testimony SecroLiry Daniels
said the disagreement began with his
refusal to appoint Fiske commander
of the Atlantic fleet, although Fiske
had also disapproved vigorously the
order doing away with officers' wine
mens.

DUTCH STEAMERS
WERE TORPEDOED
Dutch Shipping Council Re
ports Result of Findings in
Sinking of the Palembang
and Tubantia.
ACT WAS DELIBERATE
Both Ships Motionless When
Explosions Took Place
Torpedoes Were Meant
to Hit Liners.
Amsterdam, April 12, via London,
6-14 a. m. The Dutch shipping coun
cil which was entrusted by the gov
ernment with the official Investigation
into the sinking of the Dutch steam
ships Palembang and Tubantia has
Issued the report of its findings.
With regard to the Palembang the
report Bays: ,
"Three explosions took place. The
first was caused by the explosion at
some distance of a drifting mine
which was fired upon by a British
torpedo boat destroyer. After the ex
plosion the Palembang remained un
damaged. The second explosion was
caused by a torpedo, fired at short
range, which hit the Palembang. This
is established beyond doubt by the
unanimous statement of tho witnesses
who saw the track of the torpedo. It
could not have been fired by the Brit
ish torpedo boat destroyer because
the torpedo passed some meters in
front of the latter vessel. It Is pos
sible that the torpedo was meant for
tho destroyer, but, missing it, hit the
Palembang.
"The third explosion was also a
torpedo The first mate of the ship
clearly saw its track about six lengths
away on the starboard. This torpedo
was aimed at the Palembang because
the British torpedo boat destroyer
was then a great distance away.
"The definite statements of crew be
ing confirmed by the fact that no
other drifting mines were observed
and the Palembang, at the time of the
second and third explosions was mo
tionless and there was therefore no
possibility of a collision with an an
chored mine. Even supposing that the
Palembang was carried along by the
current, It must bo observed that tho
current was nearly duo south so that
a mine would have hit the ship on
the port side whereas tho explosion
took place on the starboard.
Report on the Tubantia.
With regard to tho Tubantia tho
report says:
"The ship was preparing to cast
anchor at 2.20 a. m. when she was hit
and a severe explosion took place In
the coal bunkers on tho starboard
side. The explosion caused a hole ex-
itnuinb nuui mu uuuuiu iu luti Buei-
ter deck. Witnesses noticed a stream
on the water approaching the Tuban
tia at great speed direct to the point
where the explosion occurred.
"From investigations made by ex
perts It is clearly shown that the pie
ces of metal In the Tubantia boats
came from a Schwartzkopf torpedo.
Statements of witnesses and of ex
perts prove that tho explosion was
caused by a torpedo fired from some
distance by a submarine or a torpedo
boat without warning. In view of the
fact that t no other vessel was in tho
vicinity, It Is evident that the tor
pedo waa meant for the Tubantia.
"That no lives was lost was due
merely to the fact that no passengers
had cabins near the spot where the
ship was hit."

GERMANS TRY TO

Crown Prince Bringing Up
Reinforcements to Renew
Attack on Dead Man's
Hill.
CARNAGE IS FRIGHTFUL
French Drive Back Enemy
With Irresistible Counter-attack
Germans Seem In
different to Death-dealing
Fire.
Paris. April 12, 9:50 a. m. Whllo
bringing up reinforcements to reBume
their attack on Le Mort Homme, the
Hill of the Dead Man, tho Germans
are trying to recover tho ground gain
ed by the French In Caillette wooda
and to tho north between Douaumont
and Vaux.
The French positions there describ
ed an arc from a point south of the
Fort Douaumont to the center of the
village of Vaux and the front Is a
little leBS than two miles in length.
For three days the only actlonB on
the east bank of the Meuse have been
centered there with the habitual pre
paration in heavily concentrated artil
lery fire with a finishing touch In the
form of a couple of hours of heavy
shelling with suffocating and tear
provoking gas projectiles.
After a bombardment with high ex
plosives lasting eight hours and the
use of gas for another hour or two
the Germans would attack simultnn
eously on two flanks. There waB no
visible diminution in their courage
and ardor; neither did the French
show the slightest fatigue and tho con
sequence is that the unprecedented
carnage of the battle of Verdun goes
on.
Yesterday the whole front, beaten"
by gas projedtiles, was overhung by a
yellowish cloud of chlorine vapor
which seemed to suspend from the
sky. When the cloud lifted the Ger
mans bounded forward seemingly in
different to the death dealing curtain
of fire from tho French artillery.
Some of them got through it but only
to find the French had abandoned the
first line trenches to allow the gas
cloud to dissipate.
German reinforcements were sent
to fortify the trenches, but before
they reached the line the French came
back with an lrrislstlble counter at
tack and In a few minutes drove the
Germans out from tho fortifications
where they had penetrated the trenches.

American troops have been reported to be operating. The I
aeroplane is believed to have followed the wagon trail from . I

way line, and then to have followed the railway.
El Paso, Texas, April 12. That the
American expeditionary force has
penetrated far beyond Parral and is
near, if not actually at, the Chihauhau
Durango border line, is indicated in
code dispatches received here this af
ternoon, by private concerns with in
terests in the Parral district.
These dispatches said that the
American advance columns now had a
temporary base near Parral and that
toward the end of last week two com
panies of the motor truck train had
delivered supplies at this base. This
authentic information that has come
from the flying columns of Colonels
Dodd and Brown for several days.
Villa Hiding In Mountains.
It seems certain that Villa, If he
still lives, has passed into the moun
tain fastness of Durango and that he
is in a position to get In touch with
the scattered bandit forces of that dis
trict. There are 27 trucks in each motor
company. The delivery of 54 trucks in.
dicates that the advanced cavalry has
sufficient supplies to enable It to
make long forays south.
It Is believed here, however, that
the forces of Colonel Dodd or Colonel
Brown have not passed the Durango
line. To do so would lengthen the line
of communication too dangerously. It
is likely they have been in touch with
their supplies at Parral. This would
account for the lack of Information
from the front the past week.
Simultaneously with the news that
supplies had been sent as far south
as the neighborhood of Parral came
the Information today, that local con
cerns had presented a trainload of
supplies to the Mexican Central rail
road for shipment to Chihuahua City,
there to be sold to General Persh-
(np'o trrtnnc
General Obregon, Carranza minister
of war, notified the embassy in Wash

al Luis Gutierrez In Chihuahua say
' i hat Villa has lost most of his follow
i rs, was wounded In battle of Cleni

. tains.
Reports that the Arrleta brothers at
Durango will unite with the bandit
leader were denied.

quiet with commercial and Industrial
conditions restored to normal. A Fe
lix Diaz revolution recently was re

-
Washington, April 12. Reports of a.
battle between troopers of the Seventh
cavalry and Villa bandits, south of
Namlquapa, were not mentioned in the
war department's early dispatches to
day and there was no further mention
of the reported death of Villa.
Major-General Funston reported the
progress of a new plan for sending
supplies forward to General Persh
lng's columns. A trial shipment of
forage has been sent over the Mexi
can Central line, which haB a more
direct route to Chihuahua than the
Mexico Northwestern, which hereto
fore has carried some shipments.
Nino cars of hay and oats for tho
cavalry compose the shipment.
Supplies Sent by Rail.
"If this shipment is successful,"
General FunBton reported, "other
large ones will follow. It is hoped
that the shipment will reach General
PerBhing through the American con
sulate at Chihuahua."
Conditions on the west coast, par
ticularly In the vicinity of Mazatlan,
are causing officials here considerable
anxiety.
A dispatch today from the supply
ship Glacier, off Mazatlan, said there
was a feeling of hostility growing
against Carranza officials there which
might precipitate trouble. Natives In
tho outlying districts of Mazatlan
were said to be threatening the de
facto government forces, but so far
no demonstration has been made.
Consular officers at Mazatlan and
nearby points aro advising Americans

VILLA NOT DEAD
BUT IN BIDING
EI Paso, Texas, April 12. An en-
Itlrely now version of the story of Vil
la's death was brought hero today by
a Melican cattleman, who claimed to
have suffered a visitation from a band i
of Vlllistas on his ranch near Bachi-
niba. This man said that Villa was ;
neither dead nor woundede but that
Pablo Lopez, the bandit's notorious j
lieutenant and executioner-in-chief, I ,
had died and that Villa had dellber- .
ately used his death as the basis of
the story of his own finish.
The cattleman told the following ' '
story:
"I was In Guerrero at the time Villa ;
came there and afterwards when the I
American soldierB arrived I believed !
It was safe for us to return to my
ranch. :
"Last Thursday a band of twenty
Vlllistas rode up to the ranch house. i
They took a little grain that I had
and killed one of my cows and had
a great feast. They had several bot- I
ties of liquor that they had secured
at Guerrero and Minaca and got pret
ty drunk before they were through.
Fooled the GrlRQoes.
"They ridiculed the American sol
diers and boasted about the way Villa
Jiad fooled the "grlngoes" by sending
gufdesTo the Amorlcan officers with
stories of different places he was I
hiding in. ;
"Then they talked about Lopez and
said he was dying and that as soon j
as he was dead the grlngoes would be i
told It was Villa and then they would
all go home. I
"They did not say anything different j
about the whereabouts of the Villa
bandits but I understood from their
talk that he was far to the south and '
that they were under orders to meet ,
him somewhere near Parral."
Mexican Considered Reliable.
The Mexican who told this story is
well known to several Americans here
who considered him reliable.
Villa's rldft south has been a dis
astrous one for the villages and the j
small towns through which he has
raided, according to numerous reports i
received here. His men have looted
at will and have been ruthless In their
destruction of property. Several re- '
ports relate instances of women be
ing outraged and of Mexicans who r
were shot because of their supposed '
friendliness to Americans but none j
of them have been corroborated.
Practically every man In the El
Paso has a map of Mexico on which he ,
picks out a new location for the fugl- i
tlve dally but the most reliable in- I
formation Is to the effect that he Is ' j
in northern Durango, trying to ar
range for a concentration of the VII- !
llstas who have been operating under ;
Canuto Reyes. !
GEN. FUNSTON i
TO SHIFT LINE j;
Important Changes to Be Made i i
Soon in Maintaining Com- j l
munications With Gen- j
eral Pershing's' Camp. j
i i
San Antonio, Texas, April 12. Gen- i ,'
eral Funston announced today that a 1 )
change would be made soon that I
would affect the long line of com
munications between Columbus, N. M., i
and General Pershing's advanced for- '
ces. He declined to state what the I !
change would bo but, It was assumed j
that it had been decided either to re- I
Inforce the line materially or shift it
to a shorter route. I
Army officers here have regarded i
with apprehension tho stretching of
tho line of communications and It has
been understood that its maintenance '
this long has been due to tho hope j
that Carranza authorities would grant f .
tho right to use openly the railroads i
between El Paso and Chihuahua City. I
