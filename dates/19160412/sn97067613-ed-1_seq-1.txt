THE EARLE STORE
A WORD ABOUT GARMENTS
Did jou know that you can buy a natty Spring Coat
in the sport style at $6 to $7 at this store? They are made
up in various cloths and in a style1 that simply appeals to
the lady who does not want to, put a lot of money into a
spring garment. You must see them to really appreciate
just how far a little money will go. We also carry a
beautiful line of Ladies Suits, all made in the very new
est styles and most popular cloths. Come' in and try
them on.
TABLE LINENS
We mention this item of interest for the reason that
all our linens are made abroad and to buy them at the
present time would make the price almost prohibitive,
but we were lucky to buy a large lot of these goods last
fall before the price had advanced and are selling them at
the old price as long as they last. It is a business op
portunity. WOOL SERGES
We have anew line of 36 inch all wool serges in
black, two shades of blue and brown that are considered
values a 60 cents the yard. They make up in a nice
looking gown; especially nice for school wear.
Remember we carry all grades of hosiery and under
wear at popular prices.
