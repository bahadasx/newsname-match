The text for the morning sermon
m M m S Md tTT 1 J. A.
was round in Amos i nnat seest
thou?" The subject was, "A Look
Ahead."
No two people see exactly the same
thing. Many see only what appears on
the surface, and they .really do not see
anything. Seeing things is an art
which should be cultivated. As you
ook at yourself what do you see? Do
you see a spark of the divine fire that
can never be put out . Do you see an
immortal soul? Nothing has so much
influence on a life as what we see
when we look into the world and what
. i m i t c
we see m ourselves, ine irame oi
mind in the individual makes a vast
difference in what they see. The
trouble with most of us is that our
vision is not broad enough and some of
us cannot look over the fence in our
front yard. Those who have blessed
humanity have been men 8nd women
of broad vision who went out into the
world to do things. We must catch
tha vision before we can be of much use
ii the world. The vision must precede
actionr If we can see the needs around
us, that is good, but if we do not see
ourselves doing some of the necessary
wirk our eyes are not yet open, the
vision has not been complete.
Tha evening talk was on, "Gideon."
Tnat history is God working through
men in carrying out his purposes,
becomes more and more apparent.
Only a fool will assert that these things
merely happen. The progress "of the
world hf s ever been forward and up
ward, although at times evil seemed to
triumph. Gideon was raised up to meet
a great crisis in his nation's life. He,
like other men picked for great tasks,
was about his humble work when the
call came. There are those who, be
lieving they have talents and ability
for bigger things, disdain the task at
hand. In the great majority of cases
the ambition which unfits one for the
hearty performance of the work at
hand is misleading. It is ours to do
today's work and depend on God to
take care of tomorrow's opportunities.
We put ourselves in the way of divine
visits when we employ ourselves m
honest toil. Great opportunities knock
at the door of everyone, no matter how
humble. God can only use those for
great tasks who have proved faithful
in whatever has been entrusted to
them.

Editor Barton Monitor:
The national headquarters of the
American Red Cross is making an
effort to bring the membership up to
one million, and as a member of the
Vermont state board I have been
asked to aid by organizing the move
ment in this part of the state. It may
be well known to many of our readers,
nevertheless the fact is worth repeat-
ing. that we nave in tne united &iaies
only 27,000 members, while Japan,
with less than one-half our population
has 1,800,000 and Germany, with two
thirds our population, has 1,000,000
members. Notwithstanding this poor
showing in our country, as compared
with others, our organization has, in
the past eleven years expended about
$15,000,000 in relief work, aiding the
victims of more than eight serious
disasters at home and abroad, helped
hundreds of thousands in Mexico, and
during the present European war, it
bas sent nearly four hundred surgeons
and nurses into the war zone. It swept
typhus out of Servia and cared for the
sick and wounded of armies on a scale
which may well be a source of pride to
every Ameican. A few facts may
not be out of place. . The American
Red Cross (present organization) was
chartered by congress in 1905.
Its president is the president of the
United States.
It is the one volunteer relief
organization for war and disaster rec
ognized by the United States govern
ment.
It is non-sectarian and non-political
It is organized to furnish aid to
sick and wounded of armies in time
of war, and to devisa ani fa ry
on measures of relief for those surfer
ing from pestilence, famine, fire,
floods, and other great calamities.
If this country should ever become en
gsged in war the Red Cross would be
the official channel through which
friends or relatives would be able to
locate and communicate with sick,
wounded, or imprisoned soldiers.
It expends its relief funds in accord
ance with the designation of donors.
Its accounts are audited by the
United States war department.
Nearly two hundred members have
just been added in the village of Brat
tleboro alone and I feel sure that this
part of Vermont is not lacking in that
fine spirit and broad charity which
prompts a reasonable support to this
greatest of all international humani
tarian organizations. Membership is
one dollar per year, the member re
ceiving the Red Cross magazine pub
lished monthly and dealing with the
activities of the institution. We want
a Jot oi members in Orleans county and
I am appealing to you to erive publicity
to this letter .to that end. I shai
glad to furnish, supplies and any fur
ther inform atiton to anyone who will
give a little time calling it to the
attention of their friends.
Sincerely yours,
C. S. Emery,
Member Vt. State Board

At last! the beautiful statue of
Urania, which was given to the school
as a class gift by the class of 1915, has
found an appropriate resting place
in the library. Walter Metcalf made
and fitted a corner shelf for the statue.
You should take good care of your
"notes" if you don't want them print
ed. This note came to the attention of
the Editor. "Paddleford, may 1 bor

somebody with it? I have two."

THE APPROACH OF A STORM.
The sun, which had been laughing
over the world, had drooped the corners
of his mouth, and was slowlv being cov
ered with fleecy clouds. In the south
ern sky, great, huge, black clouds
appeared, climbing above the horizon.
The wind was running about, increas
ing in mon'on and noise as children
do when they are playing. Soon the
world was dull and gloomy and the
wind was racing at its topmost speed.
Off in the far distance a faint rumble
was heard and as it was darker, the
lightning was more noticeable. The
clouds had passed over the little village
in the valley and the raindrops were
falling fast. A great flash of light
ning was seen, which wa3 followed
immediately by a tremendous crash of
thunder ! The leaves were all clinging
close to the branches of the trees and
all turned their backs to the rain, as if
they did not wish to have water
thrown in their faces, and as if they
were afraid the naughty wind would
snatch them from their mother and
blow them away. The sun begun
drying his tears and began playing
peek-a-boo with the world, and he soon
came out again in his full glory.
