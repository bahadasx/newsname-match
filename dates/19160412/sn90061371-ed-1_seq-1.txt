The income tax collector
won't have any difficulty in de
termining tho size of Charley
Chaplin's Incoino.
Tha Republican victory in Kan
has City last week shows how
tho political wind is blowing in
Missouri this guar.
A man in St. Louis died thei
other day immediately after tak
ing: an auto rido. The name of
tho car was not given in tho re
port, but we have our suspicions.
Governor. Major has just got
the idea that Missouri is goinu
dry bofore long and he ia now
trying to make an "eat a dry"
record in enforcement of tns lid
law.
The little pile of surar you pet
for your dollar nowadays com
pared with the pile yon uted to
Ket back in the old Republican
days makes a fine contrasting
picturo of a molehill and a mouii
tain.
Tho Democrats disown any re
sponsibility for the ria in prices
to the buyer, they lay tnat on me
war ia Kurope; hut when it
comes t j the boost in pricos for
the soller, well, that's di:Trent.
"There's when wo shine," they
sav; "we 'done' that."
"Holy Joe'' Folk says there is
Mn need for him to run fr office
n Missouri this year. .I is
correct; in fact there is net need
lor any Democrat to run for of
fice in Missouri thie year, as the
pooplo don't want any more f
them, for a while, at leikt.
The host thing said at tho Iv.
publican state convention held at
Kxeelsior .Springs hint week
came from Isaac A. Kiiubreil f
Kansas City, when he wo?:nd up
his speech by saying that "it
would be better if Republicans
forgot about cither Taft or
.'oosevelt."
Our l -boats won't 1', our am
planes can't plane, enr mo little
Zeppdine in't able U ?ep tmxh,
and so it goes all through our
army and navy. We spend
enough fur these things to get
the best, yet we only h.-ue the
poorest. What's the answers';'
Kither the heads of our Army
and Navy departments aren't
tho men that belong there v get
efficiency or they don't care
whether we are prepared r not.
They spciu to be willing to let
anything go, just so they are not
fiisturbod in their ufneiul chair
Warming. Honest, when we ev
s,1ln the results obtained, isn't
it a nrfw ef ego to assort
that our system of government
is lh "best on earths"
Knglavd nnd her allies got to
gether recently and reatTumed
their purpose of "crushing" Ger
many boor the war would end.
Nothing was -taid as to why Ger
many must be crushed, indeed,
nothing has ever come from
1'ngland or any .of her allies, in
eluding tha foiled Statfjf, why
this crushing must be done. It
is a dark secret, until you took"
behind the curtain that covers it
Germany's militaryisnO -don't
believe it for a moment, Militar
ism is too much of a general
institution among nil the nations
ol Kurope to make, that an excuse
for crushing out tho life of any
particular nation there that was
following the universal custom.
Germany knows from whence
has sprung this de spars to pur
pose to beat her, why the cap
italists of the rest of tho world
are spending billions of dollars
and forcing millions of men to
give up their lives as a pawn in
their irame. Germany knows
that the assault is not to c rush
her militarism, but her national
life, a national life that has de
elopel and put into practice a
octal and economic progress
that ia fifty yeara in advance of
the rest of the world. The tier
man ideas of national life co
operation of the people for free
dom from capitalistic dominance,
elf help, public ownership; tho
elimination ol dire poverty
nd diatreaa as too reward of
tha hum after life of Inbor;
io
iatellectal uplift of the psopls
were beoinninir to take held of
of the people of other countries,
and capitalism in general was
not ready for such radicalism
throughout the world. It meant
the upsetting of the age long an
thority of wealth. Therefore
tho idea mast be crushed in its
cradle Germany before i t
grew too vigorous to be controll
ed. Germany knew the tinio
would como when she would have
to defend her ideas of national
life agaiust the rest of tho world,
where wealth was still supreme.
She prepared for it, and her peo
ple stand as one against the
strangulation.
The Globe Democrat in an edi
torial one day last week on the
question of solving the problem
of tho rise in the price of gaso
line, alluding to the action of
Congress in seekiisg information
on ttiis question with a view to
enacting further legislation
against price fixing combina
tions, says: "Tho suggestion
that after thirty years of law
tuakii.g, additional legislation is
needed to deal with the subject
is discouraging." That does not
stato the whole truth. Tho fact!
that our laws fail in the purpose
or which they are ostensibly in
tended, shows that they were
never intended to be made effect
ive against the evil they were de
signed to reach. The original
anti tiust measure was enacted,
as the Globe-Democrat says.!
more than thirty years ago.1
jjitite then, both tiie Republican!
and the Democratic parties have
enlarged and extended its scope,
but neither the Republican nor
the D-'miteratic parties in admin
istering the law Las ever made it
a check against the rapacity of
price fixiag monopolies which
control the commodities so nec
essary to life anil comfort. Why'r
Because our government is not a
government for the people. It is
less su today under the rule of
the parly in power than ever b'
fore. The very fact that the
la ws enacted for public benefit
break down in thoir application
should be sufficient to convince
us that our government does Cot
govern for the people. The sit
uation makes itsown logic. How
ever, we do not regard this situ
itien as one without hop- We
hae already taken the Erst steps
in the right direction price-fining
by the government in the in
terest of the public. We hate
placed public interest above v-t i
vale profit grabbing iu tiling the
price of service rendered by the
rai. roads, by the telephone, tele
graph and other companies in the
field i f public utility, ard sine
we are right in this, and have the
power to enforce that right
making the governuunt serve
public iatorest before private
prosit grabbing then we hate
the right and power to extend
this public price fixing ever the
things needed to sustain life and
promote comfort. lxt tho gov
ernment investigation of tuo rise
in tho prices of gasoline, of meal
-the packing ccmbiuo has just
announced that another advance
iu oveat will be made shortly- in
sugar, and soon determine the
cost of production, and let that
b the basis of tho price to the
ronsnmur, plus a reasonable
profit.
Another Example of
BuvAnd-Hold Plan.
Carl Gottfried I'hlich, in Wi7;
bought 0 acres at the corner of
Twenty Second and State
Streets, Chicago, for f 1,:00. Uisj
sons sold 'JO acres some years J
a-'rt for S;15.000. The other i'KI
