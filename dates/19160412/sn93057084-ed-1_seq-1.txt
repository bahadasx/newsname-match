VOL. XXXIII-S
o. 51
Gov. Byrne has issued the fol
lowing proclamation:
During the winter months in
this climate, quantities of waste
paper, rags, and various kinds of
refuse and rubbish accumulate.
Such unsightly accumulation not
only seriously detracts from the
beauty of the landscape,but mater
ially increases the danger of fire
and adversely affects sanitary con
ditions. In different localities the
people have been carrying on a
propaganda for a general spring
cleaning and giving attention to
removing waste and rubbish,
cleaning highways, streets and
alleys, and painting and renovat
ing buildings.
To giye impetus to this clean
up movement, and to encourage
those engaged therein, I, Frank
M. Byrne, Governor of the State
of South Dakota, do hereby
ignate the week of May 1 to in
clusive, as
CLEAN-UP WEEK,
and ask the people of the State
during that week to give thought
to, and take part iu, a general
clean-up campaign.
The springtime, when Nature is
taking on a new garb, is especial
ly appropriate for cleaning, re
novating, renewing, and beautify
ing. Let us giye Nature a chance
by removing the repellent and ha
zardous refuse and debris accum
ulated by our carelessness. Let us
clean up the streets and alleys, the
corners and angles about buildings
and the yards and spaces sur
rounding our homes, using a little
fresh paint where needed, and
thus add to the attractiveness,com
fort and security of our surround
ings.
County Commissioners" Da ve
VonWald and Henry Rausch also
Walter VonWald came over Mon
day and attacked our "bridge"—
that "joy and pride" of our town,
—until the strong arm of the law
made it a "bridge of sighs."
They first engaged Messrs R. B.
Ellis, John Sternhagen and Earl
Mosber to assist tbem, and by eve
ning had it all removed and piled
up ready to load on wagons.
The interesting thing about this
bridge is that some of our reliable
business men say that it is town
property, and consequently that
the county commissioners have no
legal authority to remove it from
the town, for the reason that the
townsite company in the early days
donated the material to the town,
and the people gave their labor
free to construct it. Others say
that the street the bridge stands on
is a public highway leading to the
ferryboat landing that, in the ab
sence of a civil towuship organ
ization, such highway is under the
supreme control and authority of
the county commissioners.
So there you

this bailiwik to organize as a civil
township, if they want the pleasure
of controling and managing the
highways of their town.
