36,000 FRENCH PRISONERS
Berlin Dispatch Insists That French
Were Driven Out of
Bethincourt.
London, April 12. The battle of Vcr
dun still goes on, lirst on one side of
the Meuse and then on the other. The
French official report admits that the
Germans have obtained a footing in a
few small trenches on Dead Man's hill,
west of Mouse. The Germans Ions
since claimed the possession of this
hill, but the French have not admitted
it, and the hisht is apparently a part
of the new French line that runs from
Avocourt to Cuinieres, in the center of
which was the Hethiucouit salient,
from which the French recently with
drew. A dispatch from Paris last niht
said that there was a cessation of the
German infantry assaults to the west
of the Meuse yesterday, although the
bombardment of the French lines be
tween Le Mort Homme and Cumieres
continued. accorditiK to last night's
ofikhil communication. A powerful
attack, however, was delivered against
the French tienches between Douau
mont and Vaux east of the Mouse.
The Germans at this point succeeded
in gaining a foothold in some of the
advanced trenches, but w ere driven out
by a counter-attack
Since February 21 the Germans
have captured more than 3ti,000
French in the fighting about Verdun,
the Overseas news agency unnounced
at Iierlin yesterday. "West of the
Meuse about 25 sipiare Kilometers of
ground has been occupied," the an
nouncement says. "German newspa
pers point out that the French now
say Lethineourt was evacuated in ac
cordance willi plans previously made.
Nevertheless, it has been ascertained
that an order was issued stating:
This important place must be held in
all circumstances." The fact that
ore than 700 unwounded French pris
oners were taken and that the French
losses in killed or wounded were far
greater Is proof that the French plan
of evacuation could not be carried out
as intended.

Business Card of Charles G. Cole
43
Years Old Comes to Light.
A business card 43 years old, dupli
cate of which is printed iu today's
clothing advertisement of the Cole
store in this paper, was brought to
Mr. Cole's store this w eek by a patron.
It was practically the first form of ad
vertising which this enterprising eon
cent put out.
The Cole clothing business was lirst
opened in a stand which the Westeri.
Union telegraph ollice now occupies
A year later the lounder, Charles G
Cole, who died in 1 8i5. moved the
business around the corner to the site
of the Putnam house bar. From there
the business was moved to the siot
now occupied by the Wood Jewclr
store. From there it went to tin
old Chandler mnlding. the ("handle
general store being taken over by Mr
Cole when the proprietor, Louis Chane
ler went west after the panic of 187.1.
The business was gradually simplifies
to clothing only and occupied othei
stands where Woolworth's store now
is, and later where Mrs. Harney .
i millinery establishment is located. Tin
1 present' Bite in the opera house bloc!
dates back to 1813 when the partner
ship of Cole & Hurt was dissolved and
J. Oifter Burt opened a separate store
The uresent. proprietor went to w ork
for 'his Bteivfather at about the time it
was oLdied and succeeded to' t lit
management of the. business on Mr
Cole's death. He has built up the bus
ini-ss until at the present time it rank

The ladical Socialists, who have or

organizing and electing oflicers. D:
Lunn was not present, but his follow
ers had hoped to cany the meeting.
However, the ttrength was about
equally divided, and a!er several heat
ed arguments the auti-Lunn faction
starteii to leave the laboratory. It is
alleged that at this point John L. Mar
quette, former Sec retary of the Socia

Popular subscription to build roads.
During the time the money was be-
ng secured lor the liennington west
oad the question was raised as -to the
desirability of raising money for road
purposes by popular subscription.
i ho thought being that this divides
ihe burden unevenly.
Yes, It does divide the burden, (let
us say opportunity,) it divides the op
portunity unevenly. You and 1 bear
more than our share, but I am proud
of the fact that 1 can sometimes bear
more than my share anil so are you.
ew things do more for the whole life
and rpint oi a community than to nave
large numbers of citizens group togeth
er and give lor some public purpose,
give with the spirit of helping, without
thought of personal return or advan
tage, give just because they love to
tit lp along things that are good.
There exist good citizens in every
community who cannot give, who, be-
ausc of inability to earn money or be
cause or mammy to manage or tie
cause of inability to deny themselves
anything desired, can do no more than
iook after their personal interests.
rhen no one object can expect all to
contribute to it, no one can meet
every request; we must choose the
ones we believe in the mofct. and if it
seems that we are doing more than
our share, remember that others are
loins more than their share lor thines
that benefit us. Put probably the
greatest single thing which Keeps us
from giving as we might is because
we have never formed the habit.
Manv of us have never formed the
habit of trying to give as generously
as possible and to as many good oh
ects as possible, hvery year we
waste much money cn personal trivial
tics anil whims w hich are of almost
no consequence, when we might give
this money to public purposes where
it would count tremendously.
The securing of the money for the
west road in liennington lias been a
wonderful thing. Cont! ibutions,
large and small, came from all sides,
rlc'.i and or, interested and not In
terested. The spirit shown will be
elt in the community for a long time,
1 ne naints formed wm aid many
other public movements. Far better
to vote a tax of $2,fon and give volun
taruy, without thought oi duty or re
turn, than to vote a tax of ?5.no0. Let
us be proud that we had a pait in this
undertaking, let us be proud that we
can earn enough and manage well
enough and that we have the habit of
uiing. lot us see how much v. e can
earn (lainy anil unseiiishly,) how low-
Be can keep our personal needs, let
us le satisfied with slowly accuiuulut
ing ravines, and then let us give, give
give, i.et it ne i lie priue oi our iivcf
to see iww manv good things we can
stand back ol and how generously wc
can give to them.

(ommerce in the city of Detroit,
which made it second in income and
membership in the I'nited States, the
Boston Chamber of Commerce! being
first. Afterwards he conducted a
campaign in Dayton, onto, which gave
that city a city manacer. It was an
undertaking of gre at difficulty, but tlje
results more than justilled the etfori.

BORDER STIRRED
BY WM THAT
VILLA IS BEAD
His Capture, if Hive, Exneffed
Within Forty-Eight Hours
HAS BEEN SHOT THREE TIMES
American Aviators Convinced That
Bandits Wounds Were of a Fatal
Nature.
El Paso, Tex., April 12 The pursuit
of Francisco Vilia probably will be
brought to a conclusion within 48
hours, according to information receiv
ed here yesterday, by an American
mining concern with large interests at
Parral and Torreon. The ''messages
stated that the report Villa was dead
wai current, throughout, southern Chi
huahua and northern Durango and,
while it was far from confirmed, it
was expected that definite news would
be received within the next lew days.
The villa of Santa Rosalia, about 6'i
miles northeast of Parral, was at
tacked and sacked by about ion Villa
bandits two days ago. according to re
ports received by Gen. Pershing and
brought to Columbus by aeroplane by
Lieuts Rargue and Gorrell. Carran
za forces and Villa bandits clashed
about 50 miles south of Chihuahua
City la t Friday, the Villa forces be
ing defeated.
"There seems no doubt that Villa
was wounded," said Lieut Dnrgue,
"conversations with natives and win
physicians having convinced me that
he was shot through both legs, one
of them being broken by a bullet,
while another shot lodged in his stom
ach. A man in that condition, with
out medical attention, could scarcely
live long."
