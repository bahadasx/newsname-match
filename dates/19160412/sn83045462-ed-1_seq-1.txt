Official French Report.
TIt*> (pvt of !ho statompnt follows:
"?>n the left bank of the River Meust
the Germans this morning delivered an
attack on our positions at the Caurettes
wood, between Re Mort Homrm
and <*umieres. in which they made ust
of flaming liquids. They were everyw
here repulsed.
"Oh the right bank of the river there
has been great artillery activity between
Douaumont and Vaux, but lasl
night saw no resumption of the infantry
fighting at this point.
"It has been confirmed that the very
violent offensive action yesterday afternoon
at 4 o'clock in this sector, which
was repulsed by us, cost the enemy
heavy Josses.
The night passed relatively quiet or
the remainder of the front."
To Yield No More Ground.
Gen. Retain, the French commander at
Verdun, it is said, has ceded all th
ground he intends to. The French lim
now is located on the heights. Any further
advance, in the opinion of military
observers familiar with the ground, wili
nave to be purchased at such a loss that
e^en the crown prince, who has gained
among the French a reputation for recklessness,
must hesitate.
While bringing up reinforcements tc
resume their attack on JLe Mort Homm<
liic Germans are trying to recover th?
ground regained by the French in Cail?ette
woods and to the north betweer
l'ouaumont and Vaux.
The French positions there describe
an arc from a point south of Douainonl
fort to the center of the village ol
Vaux, and the front is a little less
than two miles in length.
Under Heavy Gunfire.
For three days the only actions or
the east bank of the Meuse have beer
? -ntered there with the habitual preparation
in heavily concentrated artillery
fire, with a finishing touch ir
the form of a couple of hours of heavj
shelling, with suffocating and tearprovoking
gas projectiles.
After a bombardment with high explosives
lasting eight hours and the
use of gas for another hour or two the
Germans would attack in two columns
simultaneously on two flanks. There
was no visible diminution in their
courage and ardor; neither did the
French show the slightest fatigue and
the consequence is that the unprecedented
carnage of the battle of Veru:n
goes on
Yesterday the whole front, beaten bj
g;s projectiles, was overhung by a yellow
ish cloud of chlorine vapor which seemec
to be suspended from the sky. Wher

| attach to enemy subjects who merely
were traveling.
Text of the Reply.
The text of the reply submitted to
Ambassador I'age by Earl Grey, British
secretary of state for foreign affairs,
is as follows:
"His majesty's government has given
the most careful consideration to the
memorandum which your excellency
was good enough 10 communicate to
me on the 24th ultimo, conveying a
protest from the United States government
against the removal of thirtyeight
enemy subjects by his majesty's
ship Laurentic from the steamship
China on the high seas oiT the entrance
to the Yangtze river, and I no^r have
the honor to offer the following observations
a^ an expression of the
views of his majesty's government in
regard to the matter.
"The latest attempt to define by common
agreement the limits within which
a belligerent naval power may remove
enemy persons from neutral ships on
the high seas is represented by article
47 of the declaration of London. 1909.
This article permitted the arrest of
such persons if 'embodied in tl?e armed
forces of the enemy," without regard to
the destination of the ship on which they
were found traveling. The commentary on
article 45 of the declaration contained
in the report of the drafting committee
of the London naval conference states
that on practical, not legal, grounds it
was agreed that the term 'embodied
In the armed forces of the enemy"
should be considered as not including
I reservists not yet attached to their
I military units.
Stand at War's Beginning.
| "At the beginning of the war his
! majesty's government adhered to articles
45 and 47 of the declaration of
London, as interpreted by the report
of the drafting committee. They took
this step as a matter of convenience,
being at liberty, as the declaration was
an unratified instrument, to cancel at
any time their adherence, provided always
that their subsequent action did
not conflict with the general principles
of international law. When the German
authorities began to remove ablei
bodied persons of military age from the
| occupied portions of France and Belgium,
his majesty's government, as in!
dicated in the circular note which I
had the honor to address on the 4th of
j November. 1914. to the rex>resentatives
they could no longer accept the restrictive
interpretation placed for practical
reasons on the terms of article
47 of tl\e declaration of London by the
report of the drafting committee, and
that they must arrest all enemy reservists
found on board neutral ships on
the high seas, no matter where they
might be met.
Attempt Conditioned.
"I am aware that the United States
-.government, after their suggestion
early in*the war that the belligerent
powers should adopt the declaration of
London in its entirety as a code of international
naval law, did riot find
general acceptance, have declared that
they no longer consider the declaration
as being in force. I have referred
at some length to the bearings of the
declaration on the position of his
majesty's government in this question,
because article 47 represents the
latest, if not the only, attempt to arrive
at a definition, by common consent
of the chief maritime nations, of the
law in regard to the matter. The attempt
was necessarily conditioned by
the experience of previous wars, and
the definition was reached after
weighing the claims and the convenience
of neutral shipping against the
Importance to belligerent powers, as
shown by the experience of previous
wars, of preventing enemy subjects
from proceeding to their destination
and pursuing the hostile purposes for
which they were organized.
Classes Not Protected.
H is evident, however, from the
I foregoing observations that the princi:
pie (often contended for in the past
' I by certain continental nations) that
there are certain classes of persons
' who are not protected by a neutral
flag on the high seas and may, thereI
fore, without any invasion of the sov'
eieign rights of the neutral, be removed
j from a neutral Phip is now generally
'admitted. The carriage of such peri
sons may in some cases amount, to un
! neutral service, rendering the ship liable
!jto condemnation; but ^ven when this
I not so, the removal of such persons
| from a neutral ship by a belligerent
i does not justify any complaint by the
neutral state concerned. The question
! jn the present case is, therefore,
1 whether the character and position of
the persons removed from the China
were such as to bring the case within
the principle enunciated above.
Cites Dangerous Activities.
"The present war has shown that the
belliRerent activity of the enemies of this
country Is bv 110 means confined to the
J actual theaters of military and naval
| operations and that there is 110 limit to
i the methods by which Germany In particular
seeks to secure a victory for her
arms. The hostile efforts of the enemy
have shown, and continue to show, themselves
on neutral soil in many parts of
the world in political intrigues, revolutionary
plots, schemes for attacking the
sea-borne trade of this country and her
allies, endeavors to facilitate the operations
of ships engaged In this task, and
in criminal enterprises of different kinds
directed against the property of neutrals
and belligerents alike. War liaa In effeci

completely destroyed, with a loss of about
$100,000.
Howard Mathena. a glazer. had just j
entered the glazing shop when the ex- j
plosion occurred, and he was blown to
pieces. Calvin Butts, a watchman, was
nearby and was so seriously hurt that he
may not recover. George and Roy Crawford
were asleep in their home about a
mile from the mill and were crushed to
death under a great rock blown through
the roof by the force of the blast. Two
other persons in the village were injured
by falling debris. The sites of the buildings
which made up the plant are marked
by great, holes. Officials are unable to
assign any cause for the explosions.

Q- Soper. a huckster of Cedar
G-rovfe,' Montgomery county, was sentenced
to pay a fine of $500 and to
serve three months in the Rockville
jail today by Judge Peter in the circuit
court here today on a charge of
j manslaughter.
J Soper was convicted by a jury Saturday
of causing the death of J. Harry

Before the sentence was passed Attorney
John A. Garrett appealed to the
court to be lenient with Soper. A
signed petition from residents in the
section of Cedar Grove was also pre- <
sented to the court asking for mercy.
The jury which convicted him made a '
similar recommendation.
In passing sentence Judge Peter said
the pleas for mercy had some weight <
in the imposing of sentence, but de- 1
clared that he did not believe simply
a fine ought to be imposed. He said '<
it was not so much as a punishment
for Soper. but that operators of vehicles

QUIZ MBS RON il
AT FORUM HEARIN6
I
Representatives Focht and
Ragsdale Push Inquiry About
Using School Buildings. E
COLOR QUESTION ARISES
EARLY IN PROCEEDINGS!
I
President's Daughter Outlines Purposes
of Hollis-Johnson Bill. Charactizing
It as Model Measure.
Decided opposition to the Hollis,Johnson
school forum bill developed in
the House District committee today,
when Representatives Focht of Penn- 5
sylvania and Ragsdale of South Carolina
began to quiz Miss Margaret Wilson,
spokesman for the Grover Cleveland
Community Forum?Representative
Focht bringing up the question of
whether school buildings should be
abandoned to the people at large instead
of the board of education, and
Representative Ragsdale being espefially
persistent in questions concerning
the color line. 1
The hearing, held in the majority ]
caucus room of tl^e House office building,
attracted an unusually large num- 1
ber of persons, who applauded Miss t
Wilson several times during her presentation.
It became apparent that the hearing
would occupy much more time than
originally planned, and when the committee
adjourned late this afternoon
only a portion of the speakers had been
before the committee.
Color Question Arises Early. i
The color question arose early in the j
hearing. Miss Wilson outlined the purposes
of the school forum bill, reciting
many of the facts which she has used in J j
arguments before associations all over!
the District of Columbia. She said that ' ^
the bill is a model for the states of I ^
the Union, ami that she believed the j
school buildings should be a capitol for *
me nine democracy surrounding them, t
Also thai the-.school forum idea tenuis i
toward the ultimate pure democracy, '
where the people rule themselves. 1
Kepresetative Ragsdale here asked '
what provisions are in the bill to prevent
colored residents near a white
school from using it along with white ,
residents.
"1 don't think that ought to be in '
the law." replied Miss Wilson. '"I
think it is a question which will settle
itself."
Edward J. Ward, a member of the
forum, endeavored to add also that it
would settle itself.
"It will have to he settled before this
committee does anything about it." replied
Representative Ragsdale.
Emphasizes the Color Line.
"Should the color line he drawn ^ at
all?" asked Representative Focht of
Pennsylvania.
"There are separate school systems P
here," said Mr. Ward, "and 1 believe a
the question would not require con- ?
gressional action for settlement." ^
"Should colored people anywhere or 1;
s very where in the United States be al- o
lowed the use of white schools?" pur- p
sued Representative Foe ill.
"That always takes care of itself." ii
"Do you think we ought to meet the ?
luestion in this bill?" asked Represen- >
:aiive Mapes of Michigan.
"Not unless absolutely necessary,"
mswered Mr. Ward.
Mjss Wilson then went on:
"The District of Columbia is benight- a
;d and antiquated in some respects." s
nhe said, "and the school principals v.
lave so much to do. that this bill prorides
that while 1hese principals n
thould be the center of the forum idea r
n each community, they could nomi- ^
iate some one else to do the work for w
hem." 0
Miss Wilson Explains Further. ?
In further explanation, she said later ^
>n:
"We are supposed to have caused b
be introduction of an iniquitous and ^
shocking bill. that, that permits school *n
neetings Sunday afternoons. Now the d<
>i 11 has nothing at all about Sunday af- M
ernoons in it. It merely allows the Ci
jeople of the District of Columbia to w
lave the determination as to when ^
jchool buildings should be used. Per- s(
jonally I believe Sunday afternoon ei
neetings are a good thing, but that is I
lot a matter for Congress to decide." |c<
Representative Focht. pointing out | ai
he section of the bil\ which gives the i
school superintendents considerable
?ower in the forum idea, said that in
lis opinion this section created a lit- J
!e czar rather than a pure democracy,
diss Fairley. principal of the Grover
'leveland Schoool, related many in- '
ridents to show the good of community j
neetings in schools.
-Do you believe it is wise." asked | t?
Lepresentative Ragsdale. "to allow any V
wenty adults regardless of their char- I h;
Lcter or race lo take over any school | '
>uilding and actually run it regardless ! 11
>f the board of education or the Com- V
nissioners?" I b:
"I don't believe the board or the Com- |
nissioners loge any authority under ' ^

Brig. (Jen. Pershing lias e taWished a
lew base at Satevo. according to infornation
here, but no word has come from
he flying columns of American cavalry
inder command of Cols. Dodd and Brown,
vhose pursuit of the Villa forces is said
o have extended beyond Parral. There
ire reports that the advance columns
lave been forced to halt until the line of
ommunications has been established

There is nothing official here or at
rmy headquarters at Columbus. N. M..
o confirm a report that Troops K and M.
th Cavalry, killed a number of Villa
audits and captured thirty-flve others
ast Saturday south of Satevo. Military

Problems of U. S. Commanders.
There are only two possibilities which
re accepted here as true in the present
ituation: Either Villa is dead and
is pursuit is automatically ended, or
e is far to the south in central Duango.
If the latter is true, army offers
say that the entire plan of cainaign
of Gen. Pershing must be rerganized
or abandoned altogether. One
flicer. who has. had an active part In
tie direction of the nlans of the exeditionary
force, summed up the sitation
in this way:
"If Villa is d.uu there is no more to
e said except to issue an order foi
ur soidiers to com% back to the United
tales as speedily as possible. If he is
ot dead there in very little reason to
oubt that he is'by this time well int.-'
le state of Durango. It is simply
diculous to suppose that our troops
m keep on going south indefinitely
itli no railroads back of them. They
ill either have to halt or arrange for
le disoatch ol' another expedition from
>nie point on the border which will
Table them to cut in behind Villa. I
in not a orophet. but the most casual
bserver should see that the existing
>nditions are impossible of continunce."

The report of Villa's death was accept1
as highly probable by Gen. Bertani.
te Carranza commander at Casas
randes, who now is in Juarez.
Villa's Chance of Recovery.
"There is only one doctor in the coun \
where Villa now is.'' said Gen. Bermi.
"and?if blood poisoning has set in in
ilia's wounded leg. as my information
as it, this doctor can do nothing, even
he has a chance. Witnesses who saw
ilia told me his left leg was shattered
i>- a fall from his horse following his
?ing wounded by a bullet. They saiu
ie leg was in bad shape, swollen and
ingrenou8."
Gen. Bertani said that Villa had not
ore than fifty men with him. The Villa
md which his troops encountered in the
adera section yesterday consisted of
renty-three members, of whom fourteen
ere taken prisoners. The survivors,
itrying their wounded, escaped into the
lis.
"Villa's forces consist now of only a
w handfuls." commented Bertani. "They
ill have to be hunted down like ordinary
caped criminal^."
The Apache scouts have gone into
exico from Columbus, it was learned
night. Led by Peaches, the captor of
sronimo, they started south x>n top of
otor trucks.
