Taking a watch apart is a
common experience of inquisitive
childhood, but the sad fate
of most boys is to find, on trying
to put it all together again,
that enough cogs, pins, wheels,
and springs are left over to start
a small machine-shop. Perhaps
Henry Ford holds the small
boy's record for this job. He al
most succeeded. Rose Wilder
Lane, to whom "Henry Ford's
Storv" seems to have hopn rpln.
ed by some member of ttfe immediate
family.
On this particular Sunday
morning Henry was more than
usually rebellious. He was not
sullen about it. He merely re
marked frankly that he hated
their old Sunday, anyhow.
Mother and father and the
four children set out for church
as usual. At the hitching-posts,
Where William Ford tied the
horses before going into the
church, they met their neighbors,
the Bennetts. Will Ben
nett, a youngst er about Henry's
age, hailed him from the other
carriage.
"Hi, Hen! C'mere! I got something
you ain't got."
Henry Scrambled out over the
? 1 t ? -
wneei ana nurriea to see what it
might be. It was a watch, a
real watch, as large and shinv as
his father's Henry looked at it
with awed admiration, and then
with envy. It was Will's own
watch; his grandfather had given
it to him.
On a strict, cross-vour heart
promise to give it back, Henry
was allowed to take it in his
hands. Then he cheered up
somewhat.
"That ain't much!" he scornfully
remarked. "It ain't runnin'."
At the same momenta
dazzling idea occurred to him.
He had always wanted to see
thp inciHac a/ n ,nn</,U
..aw luiiiuvo Ui a vnniLll.
"I bet I c'n fix it for you," he
declared.
A few minutes later, when
Mary Ford looked for Henry, he
was nowhere to be found. Will
was also missing. When, after
services, they had hot appeared,
the parents became worried.
They searched. Inquiries and
explorations failed to reveal ihe
boys.
They were in the Bennett's
farm "shop," busy with the
watch. Having no screwdriver
small enough, Henrv made one
by filing a shinglenail. Then he
set to work and took out every
screw in the mechanism.
The works came out ot the
case to the accompanient of an
agonized protest from Will; the
cogs fell apart, the springs unwound.
Altogether it was a
beautiful disorder, enough to de
light any small boy.
"Now look what you've went
and done!" cried Will, torn be
tween natural emotion over the
disaster to his watch and admiration
of Henry's daripg.
"Well, von said vam ?*roo

to put it together," he reminded
that experimenter many times in
the next few hours.
Dinner-time came, and Will,
recalling the fried chicken, dump
lings, puddings, cakes of the
Sunday dinner, grew more than
restless, but Henry held him
there by the sheer force of his
enthusiasm. The afternoon wore
alone:, and he was still investigating
those fasinating gears and
springs.
When at last outraged perental
authority descended upon the
boys, Henry's Sunday clothes
were a wreck, his hands and
face were grimy, but he had correctly
replaced most of the
screws, and he passionately Ue
elated that if their would only

Obeying Orders
Mike Murphy, contractor, became
rich and purchased a
handsome automobile. Mrs.
Murphy Invited Mrs. Clancy for
a ride in it.
"Whatever you do, Mrs. Clanft

s~yt sue warned, aon't talk to
the chauffeur at all, nat a word
or a whisper to him, for it takes
his mind off what he is doing."
So they started out at a rapid
clip; the chauffer went zip round
the corner and zip round another
corner; sometimes the car was
on two wheels, sometimes on
one.
Finally Mrs. Clancy could
stand it no longer, so she touched
the chauffer on the back and
said:
"Mr. Shatfer. I bai? vour nnr.

vou at all, but I must say tbat .

car for the last ten ipinutes."
leave him alone he wofald have
the watch running in no time.
Family discipline was strict in
those days. Undoubtedly, Henry
was punished, but he does not
recall that now. What he does
remember vividly is the passion
for investigating clocks and
watches that followed. In a few
months he had taken apart and
put together every timepiece on
the place, excepting only his
father's watch.
"Every clock in the house
shuddered when it saw me com
mg," ne says.
From clocks to automobiles is
not a tremendous leap, especially
in view of the size of automobiles.
Young Ford's next experiment
of note was the construction
of the first Ford car. This
is briefly described:
The boy had exhausted the
possibilities of the farm shop.
His last work in it was building
a small steam-engine. For this,
helped partly by pictures, partly
by his boyish ingenuity, he made
his own patterns, his own castings,
did his own machine work.
His material was bits of old
iron, pieces of wagon-tires, stray
teeth from harrows?anything
and everything from the scrappile
in the shop which he could
utilize in any imaginable way.
When the engine was finished
Henry mounted it on an improvised
chassis which he had cut
down from an old fat m-wagon,
attached it by a direct driving
wheel on one side, something
like a locomotive connecting
rod, and capped the whole with ,
a whistle.
When he had completed the
job he looked at the results with
some natural pride. Sitting at
the throttle, tooting the ear snlit l
ing whistle, he charged up and
down the meadow lot a? nearly
ten miles an hour, (lightening

Fire is Ruining Many A Farm !
Of all tbe insane. practices
which adhere to Southern farming:,
the burning: of vegetable
matter, in preparing: for spriug
planting:, vis the least excusable.
In a climate where all vegetable '
matter rots quickly and is wash- ed
and leached away by our (
heavv rains; on lands that lack
above everything: else humus 5
and nilrogen, the burning of 5
g^ass, corn and cotton stalks is (
little short of criminal. It is cer- <
rainiy insane ana we wouid <
make our condemnation strong- 1
er if we could. 1
"Oh!" but our "practical" t
farmer will say, "the cotton and '
corn stalks will be in the way of <
cultivating the crops," or in {
those sections where a scarcity <
of moisture is an important fac- 1
tor in limiting crop yields, we 1
are told that "the turning under i
of the cotton and corn stalks 5
causes the land to dry out too 1
much, so that better crops are
made when these stalks are *
burned." '<
There is about the same sense 5
or logic in such arguments as in
that of the small boy who can
see no need for washing himself
because he only gets dirty again.
It is true that large quantities '
of grass and stalks may be in the 1
way of proper cultivation if not <
turned under properly. But if
they are cut up and turned un- <
der early enough, no such trou i
ble occurs. It may also be true, 1
and as a matter of fact often is <
true, that a heavy crop of stalks s
turned under late in the spring, 1
especially when the rainfall is
light, may cause the land to dry 1
out more than when the stacks 1
are burned; but this, aguu^d^fcJ

ed under and the plowin^^H
done early enough.
Furthermore it may be that a ?
heavy crop of stalks cannot be 1
satisfactorily turned under with i
a one-horse plow, but as a mat- I
ter of fact, the man who uses a '?
one-horse plow seldom has a I
heavy crop of stalks to turn un- *
i A
aer. A.nu moreover, no one '?
should use a one-horse plow J
Of course, some will say they <
are compelled to do so, but I I
don't believe it. I believe every 1
man can get his land broken <
with a two horse plow if he tries 1
hard enough. If he can't get 1
another horse, he could cooper- '?
ate with some Other one linr?e t
farmer. <
Many of those "'ho read The I
Progressive Farmei will wonder *
if such a practice, really is com
mon in any sectionjbut we assure
these that the practice is f
quite common. We have seen 1
it extensively practiced by the
hill fanners of Mississippi and
east Texas; in the famous Yazoo I
Delta of Mississippi; by the black
land farmers of Texas; by the
large farmers of Oklahoma; and 1
the large and small farmers of s
Arkansas in this good year of
1916.
Our one greatest soil need, all *
over the South, it matters not
whether on sandy or heavy 1
buckshot lands, whether in the
humid East or where the rainfall s
is less abundant farther west* is
nitrogen and humus. Iiy fire |
we destroy these materials by (
thousands, yes millions of tons j
annually. It seems almost un- (
believable, but the man who (
thinks the farmers of the s
South have been educated out ,
of such folly need only take a j f
trip through the South during s
