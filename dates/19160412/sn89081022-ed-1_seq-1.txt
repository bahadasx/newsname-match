Acting together with the Board of
Health and other Civic Associations,
I, Mayor, City of Willmar, hereby de
clare and esignate, the two weeks
from April 17 to April 29 as "Clean
Up Weeks."
During these two weeks every citi
zen of Willmar should make an effort
to clean up his property so as to avoid
fire risk, clean up front and back
yard, to paint his premises if neces
sary, to repair and straighten up
wood fences dividing property lines
and to whitewash same, to abolish all
places that breed flies and mosquitoes,
to eliminate dandelions and weeds
and to help clean up vacant lots.
Citizens should not place rubbish
on boulevards and streets but should
have same carted away to the Public
Dumping Grounds.
This is an opportunity for every
citizen, not only to show his personal
pride, but also his civic pride.
Willmar is known as the City of
Homes, Schools and Churches, and
we should all endeavor to make it
such.
No city is attractive if it is dirty
and all littered up. We should all co
operate in cleaning up, not only our
own premises, but also help in places
where it is needed.
Let us all work together to clean
up the city during the next two weeks
and then keep it that way through
out the entire year and for many
years to come. Let us plant trees
and flowers. Let us make Willmar
not only clean but beautiful. The re
sult will be a cleaner, healthier, hap
pier and more attractive city.

Aidlewe at Free Cbnfc
The fourth college singing organt*
zation to appear at Willmar this sea
son was that of the Augsburg Glee
Club from Minneapolis which sang- at
the Norwegian Lutheran Free church
last night The concert was fully up
to the high standard set by the other
choruses and was thoroughly enjoyed
by the many people present
The organization was under the
leadership of Prof. Harry Anderson.
And his remarkable control of the
singers was probably the most not
able feature about the program.
Mr. Anderson sans two solos as did
also Melvin J. Olson. Both are ten
ors, the former strong and brilliant,
the later soft and melodious.
"Den Store Hvite Flok" was of
course the crowning number of the
program, tho many of the others in
cluding "Ossian," by Beschnitt,
"Heim," by Meier-Hansen, "Augs
burg Song," by Harry Anderson.
"Shadows," by Carrie Jacobs-Bond
were espceially deserving of mention.
Prof. George Sverdrup, president of
the school, made a short but pleasing
and earnest address.
After the program a banquet was
given in the basement of the church
in honor of the visiting singers, who
all expressed themselves as highly
pleased with the large attendance at
their concert and the treatment re
ceived at Willmar. The club sang at
Eagle Lake church this morning.
Ingvald Rykken, a Willmar boy, is
a member of the chorus, being one
of the first tenor group.
