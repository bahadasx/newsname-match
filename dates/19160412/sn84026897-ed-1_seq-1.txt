Death of Mr. Henry C. Watson.
Baptist Minister Accepts
Call Cantata Friday
Evening.
Mr. Henry Watson died here on
Friday al one o'clock at the home
of his mother, Mrs. Virginia Wat
son. About a year ago, he cam?
here from Edgefield, his health hav
ing failed, and daring the time he
has had skillful medical attention
and the most devoted and loving
attention of his loved ones, but, for
some time, it was seen that be was
nearing the borders, and his spir
it gently wended its way to the
bright land where sickness and
suffering are no more. Mr. Watson
had many warm friends for he was
a young :.man of a genial, kindly
disposition and of an unselfish spir
it. He has lived a life of honest en
deavor and strictest integrity. The
funeral services were conducted on
Saturday at the home, and later the
body was carried to Span n's ceme
tery at Wards, where the interment
was made besides the graves of oth
er relatives. Besides his devoted
mother to mourn him, are left ten
brothers and sisters: Messrs. S. J.
Watson, Luther Watson and Edgar
Watson, Mesdames Luther Lott,
J. .Neil Lott, Fletcher Wright. O.
W. Padgett, Shelton Sawyer, Spann
Toney and Miss May Watson.
In the recent fire of Augusta,
there was a twelve year-old lad
whose nome was burned and and he
lost his clothing, his chief regret
being the losy of his new suit, which
he had never worn. At his employ
ment it is necessary that he be neat
ly attired. There have been many
beautiful acts done and the follow
ing was prompted by a warm-heart
ed mother who never intended that
her right hand should know what
her left was doing. The lad received
a nice new suit of clothing besides
?x7r?is??j^i^??_3iid~^^
learning of this, published the let
ter, which had accompanied the
box, so the loving deed was known
of. The generous woman was Mrs.
A. W. Horne of our town.
Rev. W. S. Brook of Danville,
Va., has accepted the call to the
, pastorate of the Baptist church and
will enter upon his field of labor as
soon as the health of his wife per
mits, she at present being in a hos
pital. The church is greatly de
lighted upon his acceptance.
Field day at Edgefield was one
of much enjoyment to all who at
tended from here, and had the
weather been favorable, almost the
entire school would have been rep
resented and many more patrols
and friends. Although it was a dis
appointment not to see the parade
and other features omitted, the pro
'grara as carried out, the cordial
hospitality and pleasant interrr'jg
ling with friends and many rela
tives, made the day one of ut.usual
pleasures.

MCCORMICK COUNTY.
Visitor in McCormick Writes
Impressions of the New
County and County
Seat.
During" the last session of the
General Assembly I had the pleas
ure of meeting a number of folks
living in the section composing the
proposed New County of McCor
mick, among them. Dr. D. A. J.
Bell. I found that Dr. Bell had a
treatment that I had long needed to
restore me to health, and am now
here under his care. I am sure that'
I will be glad of having met him as
I am already benefitted. This is so
different from our section that I
ara writing something about it. It
is a nice little town about forty
three miles above Augusta on the
C. & W. C. Railroad and is also
the terminal of the Anderson
branch. It has two churches, an
excellent high school and a good
.newspaper. The town is populate!
by a truly hospitable people, two
banks and a goodly number of bu
siness places that supply the needs
of the town and surrounding com
munity. Backed by a sturdy class
of intelligent farmers, (about twen
ty new farmers recently moved in)
having good homos, and the culti
vation show that they are workers,
and that they do not depend on
I cotton altogether. They are so
situated that they are a good dis
tance from a court house, and al
irost equally near Abbeville, Edge
held and Greenwood. I rode through
a portion of each oe the above
counties in a distance of about two
miles. Travel in each of these
counties is restricted to a degree
during wet weather. The railroad
facilities do not enable them to
reach their respective court houses
easily. So out of a part of the
three counties they have been and
are now trying_to__geL^i new coantj
with this as the court house town.
It is admirably suited for it in
many ways. The country roads
ail converge here, while the rail
roads would serve the proposed
new county well. An election was
held in 1905, and was carried for
the new county by a majority of
four to one, but the opponents won
out for the reason that the required
area was lacking. At another elec
tion held in 1914-, the vote in its
favor was six to one, but was again
put aside. The third was held in
1915 with an equally large majori
ty in its favor, but still the matter
is unsettled. The last legislature
having created the New County de
pending upon the Supreme Court
lo decide the technical and consti
tutional questions involved, and
another session has been called for
April 12, which will doubtless de
termine the final outcome. I have
never seen a people so determined
as these, and I ara afraid that if
they are disappointed by the deci
sion of the court that some of them
will be sour the balance of their
lives. The same may be true of
some of the opponents, but they are
few, in fact, I have the first one yet
to meet I hope they will get the
New County for they certainly de
serve it.
There is lots of history about
this place and community. There
is a noted gold mine from which
during the few years preceding the
civil war with slave labor one of
the citizens extracted about a half
million dollars ail of which there is
record and it is believed that an j
equal amount was extracted during
the war of which there is no record.
At any rate it made the owner a
rich man. The mansion which he
erected is still in good condition,
though needing repair, and if near
er the town would be very valuable.
The vein of gold was lost after the
war, and the property is now owned
by a company, and will likely be
developed if the missing vein is
found which will prove of great
value. Small rocks are lying on
their property in which small specks
of gold are plain to the eye.
The famous De La Howe proper
ty of several thousand acres is near
here and is in the proposed new
county. Lrnder his will this prop
erty was left for an industrial
school for poor children, int the
closing years of the seventeenth
century.
It is indeed a picturesque place,
with grand views stretching for
many miles over hills and valleys.
It has been maintained under the

o'clock, and for four conseci
sessions interest and onthus
were unabated.
From the various charges sev
delegates were assembled. Dr.

in the various schools great enoi
to equator surpass the church m
bership;;
"WO;further recommend tba
cradle roll, a home department ?
an organized teacher-training c
be inaugurated in every Sum
sehooljof the district.
"We! recommend that Sum
schoolj.'^pnfercnees be held in
various.-charges of the district, t
these iciaiiferenees be arranged
harmony/with the plans of our fi
seeretarjttand under the supervis
of the plaiding elder.

"Finally we recommend tl

The conference feels deeply i
debted to the Rev. W. C. Owe
field secretarv of the two annu
conferences in South Carolina, f<
his presence and for his earnest, i
structive messages.
The pastor of the Methodist Epi
copal church, Graniteville, the Re
D. N. Griffin, his faithful chun
officials and the people of Granit
ville spared themselves no efforts
make the delegates of the confe
ence comfortable while in the
midst. Graniteville is a beautif
town-in a beautiful valley, and tl
spirit of the people certainly reflec
their surroundings.
The conference will meet at Swai

Dinner was called at this tim?
After all had been fed, though tl
slush underfoot and the steady dri

of the meal, there were at least tr
proverbial twelve baskets of fr?s

part of the dinner completely ''cleat
ed up." The committee decided tbs
the ground was too sloppy for th
rest of the athletic events. Of thoa
held, the points totaled as follows
Harmony 13, Edgefield 8, Johnsto
7. The committee did not awar
the two cash prizes of 52.50 offerei

Parksville's School Entertain
ment. Lumber Companies
Very Active. Co-opera
tive Campaign.
Jf it had not rained un Friday?
Paraville had planned tosend sever
al auto loads of school children over
to Field Day. Of course among
the big crowd present there were
some representatives from our town,
they report a big time and big do
ings. We are just "plum" filled
with envy down here and are ask
ing: Why cannot we have a Field
Day too.
We are planning a school enter
tainment for about April 20, all the
young people of Parksville are to
take part in it. So what shall we
do for an audience unless we have
outside aid? Of course these young"
people will look and act their best!
The young lady teachers have given
much time and energy to the play
and have plans for what they will
use the proceeds. We want an over
flow house, from babies to octo"
gena Hans.
The ladies of Parksville are be
ginning a co-operative parent teach
ers campaign. There has been too
little visiting of the school. It is
hoped that this new order of things
will inaugurate a better era.
Messrs Harris and Holly have
bought a great deal of lumber here
recently. This makes three compa
nies in our midst actively engaged
in the lumber business they will es
tablish a plant below us. Down at
Meriwether a new firm Hines and
Young will soon have a large plant.
I am told that this firm have ar
ranged for the purchase 0f twenty
million feet of lumber. Some of
this will come from Georgia. In
?some instances lumber will be haul
ed eight miles. My informant said
a number ^of persons were selling
at very low figures. This is regret
table. Mr. Holly of the- firm of
Harris and Holly will move to
Parksville, he and his family will
occupy the house owued by Dr. D.
A. J. Bell.
Mr. and Mrs. Garland Boswell's
baby '"Ronnie" has never entirely
recovered from the severe attack of
pneumonia he had about Christmas.
Mrs. Boswell is in Augusta, and
has placed the child in the care of
Dr. Moore, a specialist.
Several Parksville people came
np on the train from Augusta Sat
urday afternoon. All were talking
of the tire-that it was a disastrous
one all knew. Yet in 1905, San
Francisco lost ?35,000,000 worth
of property. To-day the fire is a
memory-the city re-built and is
prosperous. May a few years see
it so with dear old Augusta.

were not held Field Day, because
of raiu, Saturday, April 15. The
contests will begin at one o'clock,
and all schools are cordially invited
to send in their contestants, as
Edgefield merchants have con
tributed prizes worth striving for.
Dinner will not, of course, bc serv
ed, but the contests will be very
interesting, and we should like a
large and enthusiastic crowd of
spectators, from here as well as
from the visiting schools. Unless
the weather is good, no attempt
will be made to have the contests.
While we hope the contestants from
other schools will all come in, if
they do not, the prizes will be
awarded any how to the winners
out of Edgefield school.
Edgefield School Letter.
On Friday night April 14, a
declamation contest will be held in
the high school auditorium for the
purpose of selecting a representa
tive to Columbia to represent us in
the state oratorical contest. Several
musical numbers wiil be rendered
and we feel sure the program will
be thoroughly enjoyable. Some
slight expenses will have to be
covered before we can send a con
testant, and for that reason an ad
mission fee of fifteen cents will be
charged. Come and encourage the
future citizens of Edgetield.
On next Saturday at one o'clock
those athletic contests which were
not held on Field day on account
of the rain, will take place on the
high school grounds. We still have
the handsome prizes for these con
tests, and we again invite all the
school to come come and put forth
an effort to gain one of these.
