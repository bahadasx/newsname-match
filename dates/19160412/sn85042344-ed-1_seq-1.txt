BAKTLF.SV1LLE, April 11. North
eahtern Oklahoma was never so cer
tain of getting an east, and west rail
road as at present. The movement for
building a line from Nowata, Ok In,,
to Fairfax, oklu., has taken concrete
form and about the next step now is
to close the contract with eastern cap
italists who are ready to finunce tho
building of the road.
Four cities, l!ai iJesbllle, Nowata,
Pawhuska and I'alilux, havo pledged
themselves to give a total bonus of
$00.000 to the company who will
build and equip tho lino. Fairfax has
suplomened the offer of a bonus by
offering free a five-mile stretch of
right-of-way In the western part of
Osage county. Iick Flood, who Is
promoting the road, was here this
week and said he had assurances from
financiers in the east, who believe
the proposition a good one, that they
stund ready to put through the deal.
It is probable a mass meeting will be
held In this city within a short time,
vhen representatives of the eastern
capitalists and from each of the four
cities will -meet and close the deal.
Business men in Bartlesvllle and else

The messages received stated Ihat the report that Villa was

here as true in the present situation: Either Francisco Villa

the south in central DuraiiKo. If the latter is true, army of

here. In some quarters there was a

they were without official confirma

report that Francisco Villa is
dead of blood poisoning resulting
from the wound ho Is supposed to

WASHINGTON, April 11. The
senate lato today passed its
substitute for the hotiso free sugar
repeul resolution extending tho present
duty or t cent u pound on sugar until
May, 1920. The voto was 40 to 32.
Four Democrats, Sonators lirous

Joined tho ltepubllcans In voting
against the substitute. They fuvor the
flat repeal passed by the house. A
sharp controversy in conference be
tween the two houses Is predicted. An
ticipating that the house would insist
upon its resolution. Senator Simmons,
Senator Stone and Senator Lodge wero
named as the senate conferees.
I'nless a conference agreement Is
reached and approved before May 1
sugar will go on the free list until
such time as the repeal or extension of
tho duty can be mudo effective.
Most of tho tariff discussion today
did not touch upon the sugar issue,
which had been lalked out yesterday,
but was devoted to nn amendment by
Senator Works of California to In
crease the tariff on lemons and other
citrus frultH to 1 cent a pound. This
was defeated by a vote of 44 to 29,
Senator Phelun of California being
the only Democrat to support It.
Senator Phelun doclared seven
counties in California comprised tho
whole lemon producing region In the
I tilted States und thut the reduction
of the duty on lemons had caused a
loss of 1x00,0110 In revenue. He In
sisted that lemons were u luxury, not
a necessity.
Senator Varduman opposed the
Works amendment and said while ho
would vote for the senate substitute
sugar resolution, ho would not give
his assent to the house measure.
"I would not voto to tax uny of tho
necessaries of life for battleships that
aro not needed," he said. "1 have
very little sympathy for the prepared
ness program that seems to bo agreed
upon, but If 1 hud I would not be
willing to pay for It with a tax on
sugar but would raise the money with
a greater Income tax, an Inheritance
tux and a much greater tax on the
luxuries of life."
