By Associated Press
Washington. D. o\, April 12.—Ger

cently met disaster was expected to
reach the State Department late to

Unofficial advices from Berlin said
the communication had been presented

It is understood that a general out

Midvale Steel Lands
$2,700,000 Gun Order
Philadelphia, April 12. —An order
for 100 howitzers. approximating
$2,700,000, was obtained yesterday by
the Midvale Steel and Ordnance Com
pany from thp British government.
The contract was signed in New York
and reports from that city stated that
it was probable extensive improve
ments would be made at the local
plant of the company in order to carry
out the work. These improvements,
it was said, would entail an expedi
ting of nearly $1,000,000.
The fact that additions to the Nice
town plant were contemplated was not
n surprise here, as it has been gen
erally known that Midvale is already
booked to capacity and must have
more space if it determines to accept
additional munition contracts. The
Cambria steel plant, at Johnstown, Pa
is not adapted to such construction,
making a specialty of steel rails and
freight cars.

Denounces Politicians
Who Are Trying to Tempt
Justice Hughes to Run
Washington, April 12. Senator
Works, Republican, to-day coupled an
attack on the army bill with a de
nunciation of politicians who he de
clared were trying to tempt Justice
Hughes with a presidential nomina
tion.
"Partisan politics," declared the
California Senator, "is ruthless in its
demands and invades the most sacred
precincts of the national government.
It is seeking place and power where
ever it can tind entrance.
"Just now it is attempting to invade
the Supreme Court of the United
States. It is presenting to a member
of that body the greatest temptation
that could be offered to an American
citizen—to surrender his place on the
bench and become a candidate for
political office. This attempt to bring
the highest judicial tribunal of the
country, or any member of it Into
politics, should be resented not only
by the member to whom the tempting
offer is made but by the whole coun
try."
