(Fluted Trefls staff correspondent.)
F.t Paso, Texas, April 12. A battle
is reported today to have lieou fought
l"tween .Timinoz and FiiiTal hut the
Cerinnzistas censors will not allow a
ivor.' of the forces engaged to be made
prhlie.
. f irst news of the fight came when
a Mexican Central railroad train ran
into the midst of it. With the battle
raping around hini the engineer stopped
and started back to Jiminez, whence
censored nccounts of the affair came
to the border.
It is not known whether Tinted
Stales troops are engaged. Mining men
n: I'nrrul declare tliat an American
force is near the battlefudd ami that a
Y'llista squadron is known to be in that
ti giou. Tho Juarez authorities main

of Villa 's death, i
However, mining company advices

able column of nieu ivas last reported

That the main American cavalry
f irce is in southwestern Chihuahua was
snown today by negotiations between
the quartermasters department of the
army anil El Faso denlers for the pur
chase of hay and oats in large quanti
ties for shipment over the Mexico Cen
tral railroad via Chihuahua Citv. This
is another indication that Americans
are in the neighborhood of the fight
reported raging between Parral and
Jiminez.
Fort Bliss received an unconfirmed
report that an anti-American proclama
tion has been circulated in Chihuahua
City on Friday. Presumably this post
er was suppressed by Carranzistas. as
biter reports said that constitution
alists at Chihuahua were co-operating
wiili American troops.

taken $1,00(1,000 from .1,1,000 victims by
the fraudulent sale of Oregon-California

their dupes on pretense of using the
money to pay expenses incident to pur
chasing Oregon-California railroad land

.Thousands of Persons
May Lose Homesteads
San Francisco, April 12. The home
steads of thousands of persons in Cali
fornia, Texas nnd other states depend
today on the ability of modern science
to prove whether "C. P. Carpenter,''
and "George S. Jones" are fictitious
persons.
If they are found to be merely names
used by F. A. Hyde, who recently fin
ished a prison sentence for defr.uuliiig
the government out of lands, the hun
dreds of thousands of acres involved
will undoubtedly be turned back to the
government, just as stolen property re
verts to its original owner. The people
who innocently purchased the land
will bo losers.
The test case to decide this question
is now before .1. 11. Sanford, register of
the I'nited States land office. The se
curing of testimony has consumed four
years. Branch hearings have been held
in yens past in Texas, 1'taii and other
states and transcripts of the testimony
ire now in Snuford s hands.
When the Hyde expose came to light'
some time ago, charged jointlv with,
him were "Carpenter" and "Jones."

Thus far they have been found to be

Washington, April 12. On the eve of j
determining its .final attitude on the
submnrine issue, the question facing1
the administration today was seeming
ly: "How far can we go with the evi

President Wilson and his cabinet an

tacked the channel steamer Sussex with
out warning while Americans were
aboard and that the Teuton undersea
boats have embarked on a new reign nt
terror in which they disregarded the
safety nnd rights of neutrals with amaz
ing recklessness. But conclusive proof
of this may be lacking.

todav.
Great Britain, in its uote to Amerien,
outended it had a right to seize the
Germans although they were not actual
ly illicit witn onemy fighters nnd had
not violated the sovereignty of onv neu
tral.
It held that the Trent case in the Am
erican civil war upon which the Ameri

ompared with the liner China situa
tion. In this connection attention was
called to bomb plots and other Activi
ties ot tiieat Britain s enemies in neu

I'pou reliable authority it was learn
ed that the note said:
"German residents in Shanghai have
been engaged for some timo in the col
lection of arms and ammunition both,
for clandestine transmission to lmba
and possibly for arming a commerce

In concluding, the message expressed
a hope that tho Fiiited States would
not teel disposed to further contend
that the British action was not justi
