PARTY ENDORSEMENT WITH

COMMITTFEMAN MARSH RE-ELFCUED
Marsh Delegates Win In State. Cost
of Election to Delawre County
Over $ 1,600
A comparatively light vote was cast
In the presidential primary election
Monday, tin republican party poll
ing about 50,000 and the democrat
party about 40,000. Wison and Cum
mins had no opposition and were en
dorsed by their respective parties as
candidates for president. Interest
was stimulated by the contest in each
party for National Committeeman.
The returns from nearly the whole
etati show that Marsh won out over
Dunn by an overwhelming vote of
abou4- four to one. The democratic
organization delegates defeated Dunn
delegates by a large majority. Adams
was olecte^ republican national vcom
mitteeman over Oleen by a wide mar
gin.
Th© three cornered fight
in this district for district delegates
to th® republican national conven
tion was very close. The returns
indicate that Mr. A. M. Coudl of this
city was elected as one of the two
delegates.
Th« vote In Delaware County was
light with Httle interest manifested
in the election. The condition of th©
roads and the busy season for the
farmers were doubtless causes that
contributed to the very light vote
In the country districts.
The vote in the county for the
various candidates follows:—

TRAIN LOAD OF BUICK SIXES
Thirty flat cars, on which were
loaded 85 Buick Sixes passed thru
Mianchestpr recently, enroute from
Flint, Mich., to Cedar Rapids. The
train stopped in Manchester a short
tlai* and attracted considerable atten
tion among auto enthusiasts. Floyd
H. Arnold, Manager of the Manches
ter Auto and Supply Company had
two car loads In the train, and made
a frantic effort to have his two loads
set out in the local yards. The com
pany refused to grant his request
and now Mr. Arnold will have the
pleasure of driving the cars iback
from C«dar Rapids. The local com
pany has been doing a land-office bus

Buicks. The Buick factory is said
to the only factory which is en
gaged in the exclusive manufacture
of six cylinder cars, and if oth«r deal

In making the tests, six kernels were taken from each ear and ten or
mor= ears were taken from different parts of the cribs. We believe in
using only those ears that test six kernels strong, but have reported
the ones testing five strong because of the possibility of finding six
strong seed in this class but using the individual ear test.
OUR STANDARD Home Grown Seed Corn Testing 100 per cent.
SUMMARRY OF SEED CORN CAMPAIGN.
About forty per cent of the farmers in Delaware County are still with
out seed corn There are 2,485 bushels o" available corn in this county
from which seed can be obtained by the individual ear test. This
seed being home grown would assure the planter of corn that would ma
ture. Remember that the individual ar test is the only way you can
be rure of your seed this year.
The campaign has proven this to be true beyon^ a doubt.
In one township alone we learn ^at this campaign has already en
couraged twenty- five men to make the ear test. This one instance
makes the campaign a success. Our standard should be home grown seed
that will test 100 per cent. It will tak«* just as much time to care for a
fifty per cent stand next summer as a ninety-fiv° per cent stand. We are
wasting one-half our time when we ar° plowing a row of corn with on
ly fify per cents as many stalks as itshouW have, we are losing the use of
one-half of our ground and we will be short one-half of the number of
bushels due us. All experiments and experiences have shown that Del
war» County seed is the best for Delawp-e County, and as long as there
Is any home grown seed available there w*1 be none imported if we are
awake to our best interests. If we wish to change varieties we can im
port on a small scale but for our main crop we should rely on known
product 1' possibK We are sure that all the men who have seed for
sale
the county will be reasonable in regard to price.

ONEIDA SCHOOL CASE
WORK ON NEW HIGH SCHOOL.
IS STOPPED BY ORDER OF
THE COURT
CASE TO BE FOUGHT TO A FINISH
Mrs. Holbert Asks Damages in Sum
of $1000 Directors and Construc
tion Company Defendants
A litigation which promises to ar.
rouse unusual interest has just been
started in which Mrs. A. B. Holbert
has started an action restraining the
Consolidated Independent District of
Oneida and the Quality Construction
n:[iany of Independence from con.
tinuin? the work of erecting a new
school building. The directors of
the district procured a building site
on land owned by Mrs. Holbert, gain
ing possession of the ground through
condemnation proceedings. The site
in question, Mrs. Holbert claims IQ
her petition, is the identical site
which she and her husband have held
as site for a home and other
buildings used in connection withi
their horse importing business, and
that because of the action of the
board ofdirectors of the district
they have suffered heavy damages.
Mrs. Holbert has been granted a
temporary injunction restraining the
boar' and the construction com
pany from continuing the work of ex
cavation preparatory to erecting the
building.
Th« case promises to be a hard
fought litigation, and the outcome
will ha watched with interest.
