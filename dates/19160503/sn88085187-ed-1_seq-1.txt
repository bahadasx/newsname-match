A FREEMDLY TIP
TO THE MAYOR
Mayor Fawcett ought to get in step with the two new city com
missioners.
While both Messrs. Pettit and Gronen are starting off their ad
ministrations by making meritorious appointments, the mayor is let
ting the ward boss side of his personality predominate again.
The incoming members of the commission promised that if elected
they would eliminate petty politics altogether from their departments
at the city hall and make efficiency their motto. The men they so far
have selected for subordinate positions give earnest that they intend to
live exactly up to their pledget.
In the meantime Mayor Fawcett puts Harbormaster Parks in a
new position which will -rive him, in addition to all his former duties,
the important responsibility of superintending the city docks.
Parks is the city employe who was charged within the last few
weeks with two rather serious offenses. One was pernicious political
activity in the campaign, activity which was alleged to include the offer
to sell the support of a club to a candidate for $1500, and the disregard
of city duty in order to take an active part in the election fight.. The
oilier charge, preferred by a commercial organization, was that Parks
was failing completely in keeping up the records of his office.
Parks' excuse for not keeping up his work was that the duties
were so arduous he couldn't handle them all. Neither charge was
disproved or otherwise disposed of.
In the face of all this, Mayor Fawcett promotes him into a vast
ly more important job, a job which he has shown no promise of being
ahle to fill capably.

PI NATION OF A BOUT 25 PE RCFN T CH KA P I >() LITICLA N
AND ABOUT 75 PER CENT KFFKTFNT, HONEST HARD

His friends will hope that he will let the Parks mistake satisfy
the fleshly yearnings of the 25 per cent, and will now proceed to
give the 75 per cent full swing. If he does, he will be able, with the
co-operation of Messrs. Ghronen and Pettit, to work municipal mir
acles.

Dr. R. A. Rich and Dr. Ernopt
C. Wheeler, two of the mosY
prominent physicians In the city,
will jointly act as city health of
ficers of Tacoma, according to
Mayor Fawcett today.
The two physicians are willing
to undertake the work out of a
• sense of civic pride, and a belief
that they can educate the people
of Tacoma along scientific health,
he said.
They have told Mayor Fawcett
that tho health officer's salary,
$100 a month, was not an ele
ment of the matter, and that it
was Immaterial whether they re
ceived any municipal compensa
tion or not. Dr. Wheeler is
president of the Commercial club,
and Dr. Rich is a director.
"1 feel proud to think that men
of the Character of Dr. Rich and
Dr. Wheeler would offer to take
up this work," said Fawcet to
day.
Health Officer H. A. Wall's
term will terminate May 10, fol

that Dr. Wall resign by that time.
It will be the second anniver

Nicholson Is
Appointed As
City Engineer
L. A. Nicholson, civil engineer
and former cily engineer, was to
day appointed city engineer by
Commissioner Gronen. The ap
pointment was unanimously con
firmed by the council.
Nicholson's appointment came
a* a distinct surprise. There were
several aspirants for the posi
tion, which has been held for sev
eral years by W. C. Raleigh.
Norton 1,. Taylor, engineer In
the city light department, was
rumored as one of the most likely
candidates for the office.
The new cily engineer has re
sided in Tacoma more than 20
years, lie was appointed city en
gineer by Commissioner Clark
under the la. D, Campbell admin
istration and served six months.
He has issued several standard
maps of Tacoma during his resi
dence here, besides conducting a
large private business In civil en
gineering.
Cnder Ihe new administration,
the city engineer will have charge
of all city engineering work.
Heretofore there have been two
departments, one working for the
light and water office, and dupli
cating much of the general draft
ing and engineering v-ork of the
city.
