Ed. Franson Died Monday.
Ed. Franson, a pioneer business
man of Warren, died on May 1, 1916,
at the city hospital, where he has
been cared for during the past four
weeks.
Deceased was born in Sweden,
Nov. 9, 1856, hence his age was at
the time of death 59 years, 4 months
and 22 days. He came to Warren as
a young man in the early 1880's,
commenced working as clerk in the
store of G. C. Winchester, where he
remained many years, afterwards
starting in the confectionery busi
ness, in which he continued until a
few years ago, when he sold out to
Ed. Natwick. In this city he courted
and married the wife, who passed
away about ten years ago. After
quitting business, he has roamed
about considerably. For a while he
stayed in Montana, where he had a
claim. Of late years poor health
had added to his other misfortunes.
He was a genial, kindhearted man.
During his long business career here,
he made many friends, who have
sympathized with him in his physical
weakness and in the loneliness of his
later years.
Deceased leaves as the immediate
mourners two brothers, Adolph S.
Franson, of this city, and Frans
Franson, of Warroad, and one sister,
Mrs. Gust ^Peterson, of
Bristlet.

Home Talent Drew Large Audiences
The Bells of Corneville, a popular
comic opera play that never grows
old, was presented in a very credit
able and pleasing manner by home
talent at the Warren opera house on
Thursday and Friday evenings of
last week. Large audiences greeted
the players on both nights and to say
that everybody 'was delighted and
entertained far beyond the expecta
tions is putting it mildly. No one
ever suspicioned that our little city
harbored within it dramatic talent of
such high order and promise. Miss
Nellie Seign as Serpolette was per
fectly natural and charming and
Miss Agnes Johnson carried out her
part as Germaine with a grace and
poise that was pleasing. H. R.
Stanchfield acted that part of Henri
so well that he might be taken for
an artist instead of an amateur, and
Annar Myhre, who is a born actor
and musician, played the part of
Jean Grendicheux to perfection. For
est Wadsworth as the Balli could
hardly be improved upon. Marie
Thomas as Gertrude, and Ahaliba
Edwardh, Mable Lundgren and Han
nah Anderson, as the Village Maidens
acted their parts well. Arthur Som
mers made a dignified Assessor and
Harold Bartholow an equally good
Registrar. Walter Berg as the No
tary was a bundle of fun. Roy Prytz
as Gaspard, a miser, proved his
ability as an artist in the theatrical
line and always brought down the
house.
The play is mostly all singing and
those who have seen the play before
say that its rendition at Warren was
the best they had ever heard. The
chorus work was especially fine, and
likewise the music furnished by the
eight piece orchestra. Miss Ella
Lundgren as pianist proved her ac
complishment in manipulating this
instrument. From start to finish, the
play was thoroughly enjoyed and the
young people who took part in it
and who have spent a great deal of
time and effort in practice and pre
paration deserve a great deal of
praise for furnishing such a high
class entertainment. The odd cos
tumes worn by the players on this
occasion were ,f themselves objects
of much inteiest and very pleasing.
We hope that the Warren dramatic
dub wil] favor !LS^w#^fsmeJ|i
equally as good as the result ofan^
other winter's work.
Died.
Jonus Anderson, a pioneer resident
of Bethesda Swedish Lutheran con
gregation near East Grand Forks,
died last Friday, at the home of a
daughter in Minneapolis. He was
passed 81 years. The funeral took
place at the Bethesda church last
Sunday and the remains interred in
the church yard there. Mrs. Lewis
P. Dahlquist, of Roseau, is a daugh
ter of deceased.

Some of the High School teachers
walked out of the city limits the

way back. One of them accosted a
man and asked "Is there any way to
get back to Warren?"
Now is the time of the year when
Nature invites pupils from the school

meandering Snake, but the teachers
urge that such temptations be resist
ed during school hours.

^There is only a month of school
left and much of this time will be
sjjent in review. The first part of
the school year is like the last few
rpds of a race. Those who drop out
of the race fail to win so those who
get careless or quit school during the
last month have no reason to expect
a promotion to a more advanced
grade.

LOCAL BASE BALL
TALENT PROMISING.
The "base ball bug" is at work and
for the past week both the young
and old ball tossers have been busy
getting in trim for the coming sea
son. At the practices held at the
local ball park some very promising
local talent has shown up and the
base ball management expects to be
able to use four or five local boys on
the city nine during the coming sea
son. If the weather conditions are
nice enough for steady practice, it
is expected that the local team will
be in first class shape at the very
beginning of the game.

Miss Mary C. Dahlquist, the well
known nurse, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. P. Dahlquist, of this city, was
called suddenly by the angel of death
on Friday, April 28, 1916, while on
duty nursing scarlet fever patients
in the Hokanson home in town of
Alma.
Before going to the Hokanson
home Miss Dahlquist had just nursed
back to health another family
afflicted with the same disease.
Altho Somewhat tired from her ardu
ous work, she nevertheless felt it
her duty to respond to the call for
assistance at the Hokanson home and
went out there on April 18. A few
days after her arrival there she, her
self, contracted the disease, and
another nurse was sent to the af
flicted home. Miss Dahlquist was
very sick for a few days, but later
her condition seemed to improve and
hopes were entertained for her
speedy recovery. Sudden complica
tions arose, however, and cut short
her useful life of service at one
o'clock in the afternoon of the afore
mentioned day.
Mary Dahlquist was born in town
of Warrenton on Oct. 19, 1880, hence
her age was 35 years, 6 months and
9 days. She graduated as a nurse
from the Warren Hospital training
School for Nurses, class of 1910.
Since her graduation she has con
tinued her work as a nurse, going
into homes afflicted with sickness
and disease. Owing to her kind and
sympathizing nature, her experience
in caring for all kinds of cases, and
with a heart overflowing with Chris
tian sympathy and love for those
sickness and distress, her services
were very much in demand. She
went as an angel of mercy into
homes were deadly disease stalked
and never seemed to tire in her
noble work of alleviating human suf
fering and pain. It requires greater
courage, in our opinion, to face an
invideous contagious disease, than to
face enemy bullets on the battle,
field. And Mary Dahlquist never
flinched or faltered in doing her
duty. Her life was a life of ser
vice. While thus engaged doing
good, she was herself as decreed in
God's wisdom and mercy called away
the-heavenly land, where sickness
nd death "^leVei" enter. Sher*" -died
doing her duty.
Deceased is mourned by her aged
father and mother, honored pioneer
residents of our community, by an
only sister, Miss Levia Dahlquist, by
five brothers, namely, Lewis P. Dahl
quist, of Roseau John P. Dahlquist,
of Proctor P. A. Dahlquist and
Henry Dahlquist, of Minneapolis
and Charles S. Dahlquist, of
Baudette and by a large number of
relatives and friends.
The remains were brought to War
ren and deposited in the grave in
Greenwood cemetery. On Sunday,
April 30, at 3 o'clock P. M., an im
pressive funeral service was con
ducted in the Swedish Lutheran
church by Rev. F. N. Anderson, who
spoke both in Swedish and English.
He called attention to the noble
Christian life and character of de
ceased, and that she, while minister
ing to the physical wants of her pa
tients, also knew how to point the
way to the Great Physician. De-j
ceased was an active member of the
Swedish Lutheran church of this
city and of the Luther League. In
Christian work as in all other work
of her hands and brain, she did her
full duty, not for the sake of ap
pearance, but because her heart and
soul was interested therein. The
church was filled with people who
cameto show their love and respect
to the memory of deceased. Many
beautiful flowers were contributed,
one set piece being contributed by
Mrs. Green and the nurses at the
hospital, and another in the shape of
a cross, was a tokn of love from
the Luther League.. Several ap
propriate songs were sung. At the
conclusion of the service in the
church the congregation marched in
funeral procession to the cemetery,
where the usual ceremonies were
carried out consigning the body to
Mother Earth. Few occasions in our
city have brought forth more gen
uine sorrow and the deepest sym
pathy of the community goes out to
the aged parents and other members
of the bereaved family.
"God knows the way. He holds the
key,
He guides us with unerring hand
Some time with tearless eyes we'll
^2 see
And then, ah, then well under
stand."
^Married.
William W. Allison and Hylda
Lundin, two popular young people
from Stephen, were married to-day
at the*resbyterian manse in this
city, Rev. David Samson officiating.
Martin, Lundin and Edna Lundin
were the witnesses to the marriage.
CLEAN-UP DAY
FRIDAY, MAY 5
Accumulations of Winters Rubbish
to be Removed is Urged by Gov-
ernor Burnquist's Proclamation.
Governor Burnquist, by official
proclamaion to-day, designed May 5
as the official clean-up day for Min
nesota. His proclamation which
follows calls particular attention to
the necessity to the removal of rub
bish which is a fire hazard.
Yearly Fire Loss Millions.
"During last year the loss of pro
perty by fire in the state of Minne
sota was nearly $5,000,000. By
proper activity along lines which
tend to do away with the careless
ness by which this loss was in a
large measure occasioned the amount
this year undoubtedly can be mater"
lally reduced. The heavy snows of
the last winter just passed have
caused an unusual accumulation of
rubbish and waste which it is the
duty of every citizen to assist in
eliminating so that now at the be
ginning of the warmer weather all
homes and buildings may be made
as far as possible free from the dan
ger of fires and at the same time
sanitary and more attractive
May 5 Clean-up Day.
"As it is desirable that some par
ticular day be devoted to this pur
pose I hereby designate May 5,1916,
as the day on which the attention of
the people should be especially call
ed to the necessity of cleaning up
their premises and on which they
should become actually engaged re
moving wherever located all unsani
tary and inflammable material
which may endanger their property
and lives."

Anderson had done as field secretary
in raising funds for the college and
as a token of appreciation and re
cognition of his great work for the
college handed him an envelope con
taining a check for $250, which had
been contributed by friends present.
