Too Lato For The Best Trick To Be Useful
TAXES ARE AGAINST
CONSERVINGFORESTS
SAYS TIMBER BARON
Charles Buggies Gives Interesting
Talk at Meeting of the Com
mercial Club.
TO CONSIDER PROJECTS
FOR PLATTING SITES
Committee Reports Accepted New
Members Admitted Many
Attend Meet.
"The method of taxing timbered
property in the United States is
wrong. Conservation of forests is
not encouraged by the method."
These statements were made^ by
Charles Ruggles, the timber baron, in
a talk at the meeting of the Commer
cial club last evening.
Upon the suggestion of the indus
trial committee of the club, Mr. Rug
gles was asked whether or not he
would consider propositions for the
platting of a three-quarter mile piece
of lake shore property north of the
Birchmont Beach hotel to attract
summer resorters, .and for the plat
ting of a piece of property on the lake
north of Crookston mill number two
for industrial sites.
Considers Proposition.
Mr, Ruggles in a talk stated that
he would be willing to consider any
proposition in regard to the sites.
He stated that he favored the in
dustrial site proposition more than
the summer resort proposition, stating
that an industrial city was more in
demand than a summer resort city.
In his talk Mr. Ruggles outlined
the amount of taxes that he has had
to pay on lumber tracts in this dis
trict. He stated that in other coun
tries in order to urge the conserva
tion of forests, timber on lands is tax
ed only when it is cut. In this coun
try the timber is taxed each year.
Taxes Are High.
Mr. Ruggles picked out several
pieces of land owned by him in this
vicinity and outlined the taxes that
he has had to pay.
One "forty," he purchased in 1882
at a government land sale at St.
Cloud. The first year thaT the'TShdv
was taxed was in 1885 and the taxes
amounted to 61 cents. From that
time on the taxes increased until in
1914 he had to pay a tax of $182.30.
The total amount of tax on this
"forty" which was purchased for $72,
according to Mr. Ruggles, was $1,-
726.32.
Interest is Large.
Anotlier "forty" picked out by Mr.
Ruggles, purchased at the same land
sale and costing $72, was taxed, to
1915 at $1,813. Mr. Ruggles figured
that six per cent compound interest
on the tax would amount to $1,138.
50, making the total tax $3,023.50.
"If you ask me to carry a piece of
land until you are ready to buy it,
and to leave the timber standing, you
see you are asking me to carry quite
a burden," said Mr. Ruggles.
Mr. Ruggles told of his early ex
periences in Bemidji and this dis
trict.
Self Made Man.
"I am a self-made man," said Mr.
Ruggles. "I have followed the ad
vice of the people who have furnish
ed me money. I started in the tim
ber business at the age of 17. When
15 years old I managed a match fac
tory at Oshkosh, Wis."
Good lawyers and good bankers are
the making of a city, according to Mr.
Ruggles, who in several stories
brought out this point in a very good
manner.
"Capital is accumulated labor,"
said Mr. Ruggles. "The more capital
the better off the labor. The less
unions the better it is for the labor-
ers."
He urged a court for settling dif
ferences and stated that litigation is
a big injury to a city. For every
dollar that a lawyer gets, it costs the
government ten, according to Mr.
Ruggles.
Committee Reports.
At the meeting last evening, the
industrial committee reported that
funds were being solicited for the ex-
tending of the Nary telephone line to
this city. The report of the com
mittee was accepted in regard to its
proposals in regard to securing sites
for industries.
The band committee reported that
funds were being solicited for the
band. L. Burchard, director of the
band, submitted a report showing
that the financial condition of the
band was very poor.
The furnishing of a water trough
for horses was referred to the ciyic
improvement committee.
The summer railway train service
was referred to the traffic committee.
George Rutley, a member of the Du
luth Commercial club, gave a short
talk in regard to the work -of the Du
luth jOjc6aaation.

STATE GEOGRAPHICAL
NAMES AKD THEIR HIS-
TORICAL SIGNIFICANCE
(Prepared by the Minne
sota Historical Society for the
United Press.)
HENNEPIN COUNTY
The fame of Father Henne
pin, the Franciscan, is an ex
cellent illustration of the
might of the pen. In 1680 La
Selle, who was endeavoring to
establish himself in the Illi
nois country, sent one' Mich
eal Accuault with two com
panions, one of whom was
Hennepin, to expjore the up
per Mississippi and these were
the first white men, so far
as known, to see the falls of
Stfl Anthony. Although Ac
thongh Accuault appears to
have been the responsible
leader of the expedition, Hen
nepin in his narrative pub
lished in 1683, took most of
the credit unto himself. An
other book published under
Hennepin's name some years
later contains a palpably ficti
tious account of a voyage
down the Mississippi to its
mouth. Hennepin county was
established in 1852.
