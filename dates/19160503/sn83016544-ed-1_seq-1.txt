companied by a News-Herald re­
porter) within the course of a tew
days and their premises will be
cleaned up and the cost charged to
the property if they do not comply
with the requirements of the coun­
cil. The Herald will give particu­
lars of this excursion of the council
in the next issue.
Daily Mail for Cook County.
On Monday our daily mail service
was begun according to schedule
and we now receive mail each even­
ing. On account of the soft road in
a few places, particularly the Lake
county road from the Cook county
boundary to ^'ramer, it has been ne­
cessary to use two Ford cars to
make the trips as they do not cut up
the roads as bad as the heavier cars.
Fred Winger and Emil Hall are
driving.
The outgoing mail is made up al
eight o'clock in the evening and
leaves at seven in the morning, ar­
riving in Duluth the same evening.
Altogether the people of the
county are very much pleased over
the action of the department in giv­
ing us a daily mail and it will do
much toward putting Cook county
"on the map."

There are still quite a few good
reserved seats left—these can be
secured at Jackson's store or at the
school house, thru the Seniors.
"All of a Sudden Peggy", a
three-act comedy by Ernest Deuny,
is a high class professional play,
with a royalty attached to it for its
production. It is enough to add
that this play was originally presen­
ted to the American public by the
late Charles Frohman, who met his
death iw the Lusitania disaster of a
year ago.
The Senior class has gone to a
heavy expense to make their class
play the best amateur play ever pre­
sented to the public of Grand Ma
rais. This play will be a treat that
we, living where a real play is a
Inxury, cannot afford to miss.

ROOSEVELT WOULD
LEAD REPUBLICANS
Oyster Bay, X. Y., April 7.—Colonel
Theodore Roosevelt again is out in
the open as a candidate for the Re­
publican nomination for president of
the United States.
The fight made by his followers to
have him named when the convention
meets in Chicago, June 7, will be car­
ried on with redoubled vigor from this
time, shred of all quibble and pretence.
The colonel's position, summed in a
few wards, is this:
He is in a receptive mood, ready to
head the fight against Wilsonism and
for adequate preparedness and Ameri­
canism if the country wants him to
and that desire is reflected in the ac­
tion of the Republican convention.
The colonel made known his att^p
tude in a conversation with a visitor
from a nearby state who lu^s
nominated for congress and expects to
go to the Republican national qa
ventlon as a delegate.
