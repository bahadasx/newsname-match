Rumors That Plan Will Contain
20 Per Cent Extra Wage and
Minimum Features
For more than three hours today,
from 9:30 until after 12: SO, the mat
ter of wage Increases for plantation
labor was considered and debated at
a meeting held la the-office of the
Hawaiian Sugar Planters ; Association.
At the close of the meeting an an
'. ' notmcemcnt of plana was made, but
1 It was apparent that final" agreement
upon details had not been arrived at.
It Is understood that a fair, and
equitable : working plan has been
crolred and submitted to the Planters'
Association "AaVto various mmor de
tails the plan has ""not beeff perfected

details that were gone over thoroughly
at the meeting held this morning and
It was such details that were subject
cf discussion and debate,
To care for the' various classes of
labor that are employed, it was stated
at the outset, is a problem that was
expected to take time and close at
tention to various details. To have

and after, the meeting It was said that
good progress -was being made and
that definite announcement of the final
and completed plan might be expected
:. In the early future
: Rumor still has it that the planters

Attorney Darafleclares' H e is
Already Judge and Cannot
Act as Prosecutor
; Horace W. Vaughan has received
his commission as judge of the local
tf. S. court. But. whether he la now
judge or just district attorney, since
he has not yet been sworn in as jur
ist, is a question which is bothering
quite a number of attorneys.
The first objection to, Mr. Vaughan's
assisting in the prosecutiou of a case
as district attorney since" his. appoint
ment came today;" It was propounded
by Atty. George A. Davis after Mr.
Vaughan had entered the federal
court room and -taken, .a seat by - As
sistant District Attorney S. B. Kemp,
who was proseocling'the Oscar Nord
man opium case. ? - '
Attorney Davia strenuously object
ed to Mr. Vaughan's '. 'sitting In" on
the case with his associates. He
declared it was Improper." : ;
r Judge C F. Clemons declared he'
did : not want : to hear any argument
on the point. ;
Mr. Vaughan arose to state, that lie
thought the Jury was too sensible to
be Influenced Jby his, presence.
Tm not a j'ga; "Tm the U. VS.
district attorney,", he said. V
"But your commission is here," ar-.
gued Da via
. Judge Clemons was of the opinion
that Mr." Kemp doubtless would be au
thorized to bring the president of the
United States Into court to sit next
to him, . ' .
-Attorney Davis declared that Mr.
Vaughan was suggesting questions to
be asked the witnesses - by wr. R-emp.
Judge Clemons said he did not think
that was the situation and declared
the matter ciosea, . r
"To which rulinsr I most respectful
ly make an exception and assign .the
same as error," concluded Attorney
Davis.
Thus the incident ended. ,

Senator Coke learned a few days
ago that the , Chamberlain, annyt re
organization bill, in providing that tne
office of adjutanta-general of the na
tional gnard should be ederaHxed
did not limit the appointment in Ha
wail to residents of the terrltorr. The
plan, It will be remembered,, is backed
by the territorial administration, and
if the blU should . go ' through, the
BHintnnt-pnprfll will be a federal an
polntee and will get- federal, pay
and pretty good pay, at that.
Finding that under the terms of the
Chamberlain bill a malnlander might
receive the appointment. Coke cabled
to Senator Chamberlain.' The fonow
ing reply was received by Coke yea
terday: y --t :'' P.
"Mr Dear Senator: I received your
cablegram of the 16th Inst, in due
course, in which yon suggested that
an amendment be made to the army

the adjutant-general of the territorial

In reply permit me to say that I ac
cepted an amendment of the bul in
the senate the other day which, has
this object in view, and I am enclosing
you under separate cover a copy of
the biQ aa it passed the senate with
the provision marked. The measure
now roes to conference and I hope we
may be able to retain that' provision
