J. F. Roberts
Killed.
-..Tin- Bristol Herald Courier
gives the following account of
the killing of Mr. .1. K. Roberts,
cashier of the Virginia Iron,
Coal and Coke Company's
Mines at Ionian on last Th?rs
day afternoon by ISzra Craft, a
laborer. Mr. Roberts was well
known in the Gap and his un?
timely death is deeply regret
ted:
i'^J ames V. Roberts, a former
Bristolian and cashier for the
Virginia Iron. Coal and Coke
Company, was shot in the back
and killed yesterday afternoon
at I o'clock at Inman, Va , by <
Hern Craft, a laborer, of ill
years old. Craft was arrested
later in the afternoon after a
chase in the mountains by \V.
M. EIUfTmun, suporintondant of
the V irginia's mile s al llliuail.
Feeling in tin- community over
the tragedy was so intense
against, the murderer that he
was removed to Wise for safe!
keeping.
'.'Tile tragedv resulted from
the refusal of Mr. Roberts to
approve a claim made .by Crafl
for accident insurance. As;
Cashier of the company Mr.
Roberts signified whether
claims of Ibis kind were valid,
and when be told Craft thai he
could not approve disclaim, tin
Utter became incensed and
abused him. Mr. Roberts mere?
ly asked Craft to go about his
business, and the laborer left
the otiicu. 1'crhaps half an
hour later Mr. Roberts left his
Ollice to attend to some bus)
Hess in the commissary. As he
entered the doorway Craft,who
Was inside the store, drew a
revolver ami with an oath point?
ed it at Mr Roberts. The cash?
ier, apparently forgetful of the
anger aroused in the lale rer
Oari er in the afternoon, turned
to Sy.stund er and remarked
, _ .iking tone of voice," What
do you know about that?"
With his back toward Craft, [
Mr. Roberts walked toward the
nian he had addressed when
Graff ii rid. The bullet entered
his back under the left shoulder
blade, and the bullet, a 32 cali?
bre, came out at his nose, lie
died in l"> minutes. lie was
ahuver conscious.
As soon at; Craft had tired
bis gun be ran from the store
toward the mountains. Mr.
Huffman, armed with a revol?
ver, pursued, lie gained rapid?
ly on the man, but .just as Crafl
was disappearing al the foot "f
a small knob, the superinten?
dent fired at him, Sooing that
the shot did not strike, Mr.
Huffman turned and ran around
the knoli, hoping to overtake
Craft before the latter could es.
cape down a valley on He- oth?
er side. Unreached tin- other
-.side, of the hill and met Craft.
Mr. HulTniau had his revolver
Kin bis hand. Instantly he cov?
ered Craft and the latter stir
rendered.
B Mr. Roberts was :::! years old.
'( He was h native of Pennsyl?
vania. He lived in Bristol sev.
eial years ago and was married
;-' to Miss Klla Chiiders, a datlgli
I ter of Mrs. .1. 11. Chihlers, of 11 :i
Sixth Siroet. His wife, who
?' was ill, is almost prostrated by
I the tragedy, but reports from
Hunan stale that her con
edition is not dangerous. They
?H bad ono child, a hoy , seven
B years old.

noon. The body will bo brought

There's no reason why u per?

ivating calomel when 5? cents
buys a largo bottle of Dodson's
Liver Tone?a perfect substitute
for calomel.
lt is a pleasant, vegetable
liquid which will stare your
liver just as surely as calomel,
but it doesn't make you sick
and can not salivate.
Children and grown folks (tan
take Hudson's Liver Tone, be
eotise it is perfectly harmless
Calomel is a dangerous drug.
It is mercury and attacks your
bones. Take a dose of nasty
calomel today and yon will
feel weak, sick and nauseated
tomorrow. Don't Inso a day's
work. Take a spoonful of
Dodson's Liver Tone instead
and you will wake up feeling
great. No more biliousness,

semble at Roanoko, Vd., on

nates to the National Conven?
tion of the party to be held tit

Town Council
Discusses Repair of Macadam
Roads and Streets.
The town council met last
Thursday in called meeting to
discuss the question <>f repair
ami maintainance of macadam,
roads and tlio question of pro?
viding a fund to he devoted ox
elusiveh to that purpose.
The Mayor submitted figures
showing that the town had ex?
pended nnnunil> for the past
live years an average of $3t)l?G..
.">7 on roads, streets, sidewalks,I
bridges and culverts, all of
which are properly ehargihle
to the road tax. which or
dinnriallv yield an average of
about ?2,000.
The town has been receiving
abotil $140.00 annually from
persons operating automobiles
for carrying passengers for
profit, which sum made tint u
poor showing toward providing
means with which to repair the
roods.
Action was finally taken at
the meeting by levying a license
lax upon residents of ttui town
owning or operating automo?
biles of twenty horsepower or
less of ?lLO0 per aniieiii, and
for cars of over twenty horse?
power ? 10,00 per annum.
The license tax was further
amended by levying a license
tax of ,'..oo additional for tin'
privilege of Operating the small
cars in livery and Of $10 00 for
so operating the larger cars. In
other words, the placing of cars
in lii-fery just doubles the tax on
such cars.
It was .also provide,! that for
everv dollar raised by the li?
cense of aiitomotdlcti the conn. I
Uli would appropriate an equal
amount out of thh general fun.Is
of the town, and in this way
ereilte a fund to lie used for the
purpose of repair and maintain
mice of macadam roads and
streets ami for no other pur?
pose.
It was evident that a fund
was necessary for the purpose
named and the methods adopt?
ed was believed to be probably
as fair as any that could b o -
been devised.
These license taxes ate due
and payable on the first day of
Ma> eaeb year.
J. N0MENT POWELL MAY
ENTER RACE AGAINST
SLEMP.
Washington, April 28i?It is
tint belief in political circles
here thai .1. Norinent Powell,
of Wytheyilie, will be the
nomiu.f the Ninth district
Democratic convention to op
pose Congressman 0. Bascohi
Klein p tliis fall.
Powell can have the nomina?
tion without much dillictllly if
be desires it, it is said.
Two other prominent Ninth
district Democrats who in ad?
dition lo Senator it. P. Buchan?
an, b ivo been spoken of as pus
sible candidates, are Hon. Lee
Trinkle, of Wytheville, now in
tin- Slate Senate, and I). A.
.Ionian, of Dublin, a member of
the Virginia House.
Trinkle, it is learned, has al?
ready been approached and
tentatively ottered the nbmiha
lion, nut declined it.
Senator Buchanan stated to?
day that he has no intention of
making the race for Congress
from the Ninth district. He is
a candidate for Lieutenant
Governor now ami does not
wish to have too many irons in
tlm tire.
Ktforts are being made by tho
Ninth district Democrats to got
I Mr. Powell in run for Congross;
it was stated today b> a man
prominent in Southwest Vir?
ginia politics. The prospects
for defeating Mr. Stomp, this
man?said,are by no means hope?
less.
The visitor then wont on to
explain that Slemp is not so
hard to defeat as many believe,
and reviewed the majorities by
wliieh he has defeated hiB op?
ponents since 1900 by way of
illustration.
"In tue last campaign made
by lion. Campbell Slemp,father
of the present Congressman, ho
defeated "Dob" IJ nice in 1900
by 13,708 to l l,77?, a majority
2,011," said this Democratic
visitor from the Ninth district.
"In 1908," ho continued,
"Bascotn Slemp defeatedClaude
Byars 15,093 to 11,592, or a
majority of 4,101.
lo 1910 Slemp bad a narrow
escape from defeat at the hands
of IIenrj U. StUurt, who polled
10,731 to Sletnp's 10,958,.cutting
tho Itoptlblicau majority down
to J27.
"Bascom Slemp defeated
General Kufus A. Avers in 1912
by 14,808 to 13,3.57* a majority
of 1,011. In the last contest
Tille Irvine was defeated by a
majority of 1,17s. Irvine did
not make what some people
thought was a very groin cam
paign and the people over in
the Ninth still believe the dis?
trict can he reclaimed."
Ii was admitted by the speak?
er thai to make a respectable
showing against Mr. Slemp
would require a well organized
campaign and the expenditure
of considerable money. It was
recalled that Governor Stuart
was reputed to have spent about
$63,000 of his own money and
$5,i 00 subscribed by friends
when he cut Slump's majority
low n to 'JJ7.
The speaker opined that if
events of the next few months
turn 1910 into a good Demo?
cratic year ami J. NormoiU
I'owetl is nominated and makes
the race that is OXpeutod of him,
there \b a chance of Mr. Slemp's
defeat;
