Berlin, May 3. The draft of
the German reply to the Amer
ican note has been finished. The
reply is subject to minor
changes, which may result from
an exchange of views between
Berlin and the general head
quarters. Germany's attitude will be
stated precisely and clearly,
and the note will communicate
the definite nature of the in
structions to be given the sub
marine commanders, and other
data on which Washington it
self can best judge the. situa

the nature of the reply still ex
ists, the Associated Press is per
mitted to make these statements-
The delivery date is not fixed.
First Indication to U. S.
Washington, D. C, May 3.
The announcement from Berlin
that new and definite instruc
tions will be given to the Ger
man submarine commanders is
the first positive indication of
how Germany will attempt to
mt'et Wilson's final demand
that she abandon her present
submarine warfare.
President Wilson is unshaken
in his determination that the is
sue is non-negotiable. He is
only willing to discuss the war
fare on the basis that new or
ders have been given and evi
dence that they will be carried
out in good faith.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO
UNCOVER THE INFLUENCES
RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING OF
TELEGRAMS.
Washingon, May 3. The depart
ment of justice will probably make
an investigation to uncover the in
fluences responsible for the sending
of thousands of telegrams to con
gressmen urging that no action be
taken leading to war with Germany.
This was the result of a conference
today between President Wilson and
Senator Hasting, who received nu
merous messages.

CLAIM IT FIRE HAZARD.
At the regular meeting of the board
of city commissioners last night, reso
lutions were introduced appointing ap
praisers in paving district No. IS, G
St., S. W., to appraise abutting prop
erty. Those appointed were O. M.
Redfleld, E. E. Gulllot, and W. S.
Smith. A resolution was also present
ed showing the necessity of paving
Douglass Boulevard, S. E., also one
authorizing the city clerk to notify all
property owners on third avenue, N.
V., near the Ringling depot to enter
protest against paving this street with
in a certain time, if they desired to do
so. This protest must be Hied before
the next regular meeting. A resolu
tion was also passed condemning the
planing mill property on West Main
St., In block 376, and ordered it trken
down within 20 days. This is situated
opposite the Randol hotel near the
Robison opera house.
The regular bills against the city
wore audited and allowed. In the ab
sence of Mayor Mullen, Commissioner
Lasher was acting mayor.
ACCORDING TO PREVIOUS AGREE
MENTS THE TIME HAS ARRIVED
WHEN THIS COUNTY CAN HAVE
TWO REPRESENTATIVES.
Carter county can now have two
representatives in the state legisature
according to previous provisions that
reduced the representation after the
first session of the first legislature
from two to one. It was agreed at the
time of reducing the representation
that that condition would stand for a
certain period of time, after which
two were to be granted, etc. This
time has arrived now, and this coun
ty will not only have one candidate
for the legislature, but two and per
haps half a dozen, of course with the
usual provision of the survival of the
fittest in the general primary to be
held August first.
D. S. Hoover of Loam la already an
announced candidate and who the oth
er one will be Is problematical. There
are several Infant ambitions said to be
In cold storage awaiting the 'proper
time to make formal announcement,
but their desires are not pronounced
enough at this time to make their
names public. There is little doubt,
however but what the office will not
have to go seeking the man, and the
field will probably be full of embryo
statesmen gunning for the Job before
August first.

Pittsburg, Pa.. May ?,. A troop

on a special train in East Pittsburg
today for duty in Turtle Creek and
Monongahela Valley strike riot dis
tricts. This is the first militia to
reach the disturbed section.
Interest in the strike shifted today

QUESTION OF
HOTEL STILL
NOTHING HAS BEEN HEARD FROM
MR. SHARP, AND OTHER MEN
ARE BEING SOUGHT BY CHAM
BER OF COMMERCE.
The Sharp hotel proposition has
seemingly come to a standstill at
present, and the citizens are wonder
ing what has become of it. Mr. Sharp
was to have been in this city the fif
teenth of last month, he failed to ar
rive and a diligent search over various
oil field sections of the county so far
has failed to reveal his whereabouts.
President Mullen of the chamber of
commerce stated this morning that he
did not know what to think about the
matter, but had the hotel proposition
up with one or two other parties who
are expected here within a few days
to go over the situation with him.
"Ardmore neeas another big hotel"
said Mr. Mullen, "and you can assure
the people that the chamber of com
merce will do everything in its power
to secure one." Mr. Sharp has exten
sive Interests In various parts of the
countrya nd he is probably unavoid
ably detained and will be here later.
However, Mr. Mullen states that the
citizens want a hotel and if they are
able to secure another person to build
it, will give them the opportunity of
doing so. The chamber of commerce,
it is understood, had all the local stock
for the Sharp proposition subscribed,
and only await his decision in the
matter.

Dublin, May 3. The fire chief es

pounds and to stock three-quarters of
a million pounds.
The number of buildings destroyed
or damaged is one hundred seventy
nine. FOURTEEN FAMILIES APPLIED.
That Many People Offered to Take
One Home in One Day.
Miss Ola Holloway, who advertised
a home in last Sunday's paper for
rent, had fourteen calls during the
day. This gives a pretty clear Idea
of the demand that exists here for
homes. Ardmore people ought to
build more. The investment is safe,
it brings good returns and the city
is being held back because homes
are not being built fast enough.
Homes are being completed in the
city on an average of about one a
day, and the activity in building
should bo doubled and two homes
should be completed every day from
now until the end of the year. By
that time the prospects are that four
homes a day will be needed.

POPULATION
OF ARD10RE
IS GROWING
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE INDICATES
A POPULATION OF EIGHTEEN
THOUSAND. EVERY HOME IS
OCCUPIED.
The average daily attendance of the
Ardmore public schools has reached
the 2,000 mark, according to Superin
tendent Richards' report to the 'hoard
of education which met In regular ses
sion Monday. It Ardmore can figure
her population on the same basis as
other cities have done, the population
today Is nearer the 13,000 mark than
it is 15,000.
Statistics of Oklahoma City showed
that in 1910 when the federal census
was taken and gave that city over
G-1,000 Inhabitants, the average daily
attendance at the public schools was
6,000. The statistics for Ardmore in
1910 when the census was taken, are
not available, but Supt Richards be
lieves it was a little in excess of 1,000
or one-eighth of the population of the
city as recorded by census returns.
Such being the case, Ardmore must
have in excess of 10,000 population,
and judging by the fact that there are
practically no vacant residences, and
scores of homes recently finished, and
scores more in course of construction,
t he estimate is not very excessive.
IN ORDER THAT THEIR NAMES
APPEAR ON THE TICKET IT IS
NECESSARY FOR THIS TO BE
DONE BEFORE JULY FIRST.
This is the first day designated by
law for candidates for county offices
to register with the secretary of the
county election board, and secretary
Carlock will be found in his office at
the city hall, ready to accommodate
any candidate who desires to get his
name registered before he (the candi
date) forgets the fact that it is Im
perative that he gets his name en
rolled in order that it appear on the
ballot on election day.
All candidates for state office will
be required to register with J. S. Mor
ris, secretary of the state election
board. Oklahoma City, before the 11th
day of June.
Many county candidates have al
ready announced, but the chances are
that more will be added to the list be
fore the time for filing closes. Howev
er, It would be a good plan for every
one to register early and have the
matter done with, that there may be
j no slip at the last moment.
Secretary Carlock can be found at
the city hall every day, where quali
fied voters according to the provisions
of the election law may also be regis
tered for that precinct

El l'aso, Texas, May 3. Ad
vices from Mexico Cily and
Washington are awaited today
to put the seal of approval upon
the provisional agreement that
is understood to have been
reached at the informal confer
ence between Scott and Obre
gon last night.
General Scott sent the details
in a coded report to Washing
ton as did Obregon to Mexico
City, and the answers are not
expected before Thursday.
It is regarded here that an
other conference will be unnec
essary and that the final word
will come from Washington
and Mexico City.
The agreement is understood
to include that the Americans
will retire a short distance and
cope with the Villa bandit3
within a limited territory.
Reports that the American
troops will be withdrawn in 30
or 60 days, are not confirmed.
El Paso, Tex- May 3. The
.tentative agreement, which is
said to have been reached be
tween Scott and Funston and
.Obregon, was generally under
stood today to provide for the
gradual retirement of Ameri
cans from Mexico.
Made Progress Last Night.
Kl l'aso, Tex., May 3. The confer
ence between General Scott and Gen
eral Obregon last night was not con
cluded until after midnight. Neither
would give out any Information as to
what had been accomplished, but It
is understood that Obregon was con
vinced that there Is no possibility of
altering the intention of the United
States not to withdraw General Per
shing's forces Immediately. It is In
ferred that the Mexican minister of
war decided not to press the question,
of withdrawal owing to the possibil
ity of a break with the Washington
government.
General Scott Is said to have In
dicated to Obregon the following:
"That the United States is the best
friend Mexico has; that President
Wilson only wishes to see Mexico
rid of Villistas, and as soon as this
is accomplished the American
troop will be withdrawn; that It ap
pears the attitude of the United
States government has not been pro
perly understood since, far from seek
ing Intervention, that Is the very
thing it wishes to avoid; that finally,
the majority of the American people
and even the military, are In ac
cord with President Wllso . & desire
to avoid intervention."
General Scott is said to have In
formed Obregon that the Washington
government has been advised that
the Villa element Is still very stron?
