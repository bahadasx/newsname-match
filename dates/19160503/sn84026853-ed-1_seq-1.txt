Caroline legislature. Mr. Ashley
-died on Saturday morning at 5.25

Sullivan and J. E. Breazeale, S. M.
Pearman, W. W. Scott, J. L. Jackson,
H. C. Summers, K. P. Smith, J.
T. Cox, O. D. Gray and H. F. Cely,
all members of the house at different

The active pallbearers were:
Messrs. Joshua W. Ashley, Jr., J. T.
G. Ashley, Jr., Joshua Ashley, Jr.,
S. G. Murdock, James Ashley, W.

Sketch of Life
Mr. Ashley was born December 16,
1848, in Martin township, being the
son of Edward and Elizabeth Ashley.
He was reared in this county
and continued to live in it until his
death, the place of his residence for
the greater part of his life being at
Honea Path.
On February 18, 1875., Mr. Ashley
nme mnrripH th Miss Mahala Moore
of Abbeville county, and she with
six children also survive. The children
are: M. J. Ashley of Abbeville
county, Mrs. W. H. Canfield, Mrs.
tf. B. N. Ashley, Mrs. Jas. N. Pearman,
Joe M. H. Ashley and Orr
Ashley. He is also survived by 24
grandchildren and two great grandchildren.
Born and reared a poor boy, Mr.
Ashley had to work very hard in his
early days. At the age of 21 he was
working at a small salary on the
farm. Later he began farming for
himself and during his life time
succeeded in accumulating a comparatively
large fortune. In addition
to running his large farm at
'Honea Path, he for a while engaged
in the mercantile business on a small
scale.
Mr. Ashley's first entrance into
politics was in 1892. During the
? ;1 ?Qn unmp nf his friends
tampaigii vx avvv wV.MV ?
put his name forward as a candidate
for the house of representatives,
but he declined to run. However,
in 1892 he announced himself as a
candidate for the house and was
elected. With the exception of two
years, he served continuously for 20
years, his last term expiring in
1914. This record is one that is
probably unequalled.
Upon his entrance into the house
of representatives, Mr. Ashley soon
made a record for himself and was
from the start recognized as a leader.
He was appointed a meirtber of
a number of the important committees,
and for a long period was chairman
of the agricultural committee,
one of the most important in the
Tionse.
Mr. Ashley's record in the house
is known throughout the state. He
always entered into a fight with his
whole soul, and there was never any
doubt in the minds of the people how
he stood on any measures before
the house. He was the first representative
in South Carolina to introduce
a bill regulating the hours of
labor for the cotton mills, and his
bill ultimately became a law. He
strived to do everything within his
power to secure legislation favorable
t othe farmers, laboring classes and
poor people. Because of his strong
opposition to extravagant appropriaxf
1? <<rTV?o WflfpVi
tions liv was uuuucu ??
of the Treasury." He was a great
and strong advocate for liberal pensions
for Confederate veterans and
their widows. He always fought for
liberal appropriations for the state
- hospital for th einsane, and was recognized
as a true friend of the institute
for the deaf and dumb. These
three things stand out preeminently
in Mr. Ashley's record as a member
of the legislature.
Mr. Ashley led the fight for the
repeal of the Lloyd Radical bonds,
which were issued during reconstruction
times. There was sufficient evidence
to show that these bonds had
been paid, and yet they continued to
come up for redemption. For 10
years the legislature had the matter
of again redeeming these bnods, and
Mr. Ashley was instrumental in having
these bonds written off the books
of the state.
DUBUN REBELLION
MEETS DOWNFALL
REBEL LEADERS OF DUBLIN ALL
HAVE SURRENDERED TO
TROOPS OF GREAT BRITAIN
London, May 1?Official announcement
was made this afternoon that
the leaders in Dublin had
rurrendered.
Rebels of the rank and file followed
the examole of their leaders yesterday
morning and confessed the
cause of the Irish republic was lost:
by laying down their arms at the
foot of the Parnell monument in
Sackville street and surrendering to
British troops. About 450 of them
who had fought since Monday in this
central area marched out from their
strongholds under the white flag and
gave themselves up. A few irreconcilables
continued sniping from lairs
difficult to locate on roofs or among
rafters of buildings nearby.
Soon afterward a rebel lieutenant,
wearing a heather green uniform
and carrying a white flag, came in
with a guard of ten men from the
adjoining county of Meath to learn
the truth about rumors of a general
surrender.
Movement Collapse*.
The party marched off to the cas4'
""J lnn?na^ from .T TT. PPart*.6.
tic auu icantvu r
who was named provisional president
of the Irish republic, that the movement
had collapsed and was advised
to resist no longer. The lieutenant
and his escort then started out to
parley with the rebels In the country
districts in an effort to induce them
to lay down their arms.
James Connolly, one of the leaders
of the uprising, is said by government
officials, to be a prisoner,
wounded, in the castle.
THE PIANO EXHIBIT.
Elsewhere in this issue will be
found an advertisement of the John
A. Church Company. These people
are making an exhibit of pianos and
are going to put them on the market

instruments at genuine factory prices
For the past two weeks there has
been an excellent exhibit held in the
room next to Haddon-Wilson store
and every afternoon and night there
has been held a concert of unusual
merit. Our people have enjoyed
, the music and the player piano both
and the concerts have been well attended.
This exhibit is in charge
of a corps of courteous and obliging
young men, who will call on the people
of the town and county this week
in the interest of their instruments.
WHAT MIMS THINKS OF US.
Last ween ine sevenin graae young
people in their English exercises
were given a theme to write and the
subject was "Fort Pickens." There
was a general scramble over town
for something of the history of the
little settlement and many of the
papers told of the block house and
of the old well on the place now
owned by Mrs. Hemphill. But not
so with Mims Cason, he cares nothing
for history and brought in a paper
with something like the following:
''I used to go to Fort Pickens a
great many times but I do not go
over there much now. A great many
,nice people live in Fort Pickens.
Some of my best friends live in Fort
Pickens. A lot of boys and girls
from Fort Pickens come to school,
and they take a high stand in their
classes."
Some of thes days we expect to
see Fort Pickens Dointed out as the
place where Mims Cason once visited.

7S IN BRIEF |
SEVENTH GRADE LATIN.
The study of Latin in the Graded
School is taken up in the seventh
Grade and this year the young people
have made good progress in the
study under Miss Louise Sullivan.
Last week Dr. King, who ttas charge
of the Baptist church here until summer,
made a visit to the school and
after listening to the class recite,
gave as his opinion that the seventh
grade Latin class was well taught
and was advanced further than any
class that he has ever seen.
This is praise indeed, and should
be appreciated by Miss Sullivan and
her pupils.

FAMINE IN LEAD PENCILS. b
c
A pencil famine threatens America
as a result of the war. Pencil mak- a
ers say that one of the ingredients of
a pencil is a form of analline dye, ?
and the supply is steadily falling off. w
Indellible pencils will be almost an jy
unknown quantity if the war keeps ^
up much longer.
Pencil makers are paying three
times as much for the materials used
in putting a finish on a pencil as formerly,
and soon there will be no more p
to be had. The output of copying pen- g
cils has dwindled to almost nothing Ci
since the beginning of the war. They 0
are among the most extensively used tl
in America and are considered indispensable
to railroads and other industries.
A dye known as methyl violet
is required in making this pencil, and, R
as the dye comes exclusively from ]y
Germany, there is no more to be had. t<
