ROGUE BEETS
1 DOING
WELL
George Austin, Cultural Ex
pert, Says That Crop in
the Grants Pass District
Is in Excellent Condition
"1 havo today seen fleldt of sugar
bttti la the Grants Pass district
where the stand u perfect, and the
oil In Juat u excellent condition ti
any In Utah, where wa bare been
growing beeta for many yean," wai
the atatement of Oeo. Austin. cultural
xpert for tbe sugar factories of Utah,
who was In this rlty for hi second
vlwlt Ttieadsy.
Mr. Austin apoke most optimistical
ly of the progress being made In the
Home valley, and waxed almost en
thusiastic aa he nave hla views of the
beautiful country through which he
bad been driving during the day. He
aid that he found the beet crop d 4n
well In moat Instances, and be e ,
ed that some one In tbo Rogun vflllr :
would pull down the record for heavy
yield per acre for he had sn the
beat kind of soil and the best possible
stands of young beeta here. Mr.
Austin said thiil the bect-plantlng
eason would extend for at least a
month yet. In Utah beets are plant
ed as late as the 1 0th of June, and
ome of the best crops have been ob
tained from these late plantings, re
marked Mr. Austin. Here, he said,
with our much longer growing season,
there was no reason why a full crop
should not be matured with late
plantings, and he urged thnt those
who had not yet planted do so yet.
Another angle of the Industry In
the Roguo valley that Mr. Austin
considers most promising Is that of
the growing of beet seed. He be
lieved that conditions here might be
found Ideal for the growth of the
eed, and he advlsod the people here
to test seed-growing fully. Beets that
Mr. Austin had found In the ground
as late aa February upon the occasion
of hla first visit here he said were In
perfect condition, and he was confi
dent that much of the expense of pro
ducing soed In Utah would he done
away with here, where 1t would not
be necessary to pull the. soed beets
and store them over winter, only to
et them In the ground In the spring.
Thli procedure la necessary In Utah.
Beets of laat year'a crop that had been
grown on the Hood place weat of
town Mr. Auatln reported now ahow
d a much hotter aeed stalk than the
beota ot Utah. Mr. Austin also cau
tioned the farmers not to feel down
hearted If the baby 'beeta soon after
they appeared above the ground, espe
cially during a cold apell of weather,
did not have a healthy appearance.

statoment on returna from more than
halt the preclnrta ot the state,
Francis V, Keeallng, chairman of tbe
republican state central committee,
claimed today that tbe regular
G. 0. l delegates to tbe Chicago con
vention had been elected over tbe
United Republlcau candidates by a
plurality ot more than 40,000.
With slightly more than half of
the vote tabulated, the United Re
publicans claimed a lead in Fresno,
Stanislaus, Sacramento, Riverside,
San Joaquin, Santa Barbara, and San
Luis Obispo counties. The other
counties were claimed by tbe "regu
lars." United randldatea were pledged to
Join with the progressives It the oc
casion presented, to support a "for
ward looking candidate." They had
tbe support of Governor Johnson.
The "regulara" are unpledged.
A good democratic vote was cast,
but there was little excitement In that
party's election, as all candidates
were pledged to President Wilson.
The progressive vote was rather
email, as there was no contest. Wo
men did not go to the polls In large
numbers in San Francisco.
BRITONS DETAIN
AMERICA! WOMEfl

Evelyn of San Francisco and her
daughter, Miss Anna Evelyn, were
taken from the Holland-American
liner Rydam by British officials at
Falmouth and hold, for examination,
officers of the steamer reported when

department directing him to Inter
view Evelyn, who Is a mining man,
with interests In Grass Valley, and
learn what he knew about the arrest
ot his wife and daughter by the Brit
ish.
Evelyn told Rathbun that hla wife
wai German born and that the only
possible reason for her detention
might be that the British censor had
opened some of her letters from Ger
many containing pro-German senti
ments. Evelyn himself Is English.
He met his wire In Nancy, France,
in 1909. The daughter, who was
taken Into custody with her mother,

IRISH REVOLT LEADERS
ARE EXECUTED TODAY
Announcement That Summary Action Had Been Taken
With Men Who Had Signed the Proclamation of In
dependence That Caused Recent Uprising Came As a
Surprise Following Resignation of Secretary Birrell
London. May 6. Announcement
that P. H. Pearse, James .Connolly
and another Irish rebel leader bad
been executed was made by Premier
Asqulth In the house ot commons to
day, Just a moment after the resigna
tion of Augustine Birrell, chief secre
tary for Ireland, had been made
public.
Asqulth stated that the three men
shot to death by a firing squad had
signed tbe proclamation announcing
the establishment of an Irish re
public. This statement eliminated
the possibility of Sir Roger Case
ment being the third man killed, as
hla name was not attached to the pro
clamation.
The swiftness ot tbe government's
action waa a surprise. There had
been no previous announcement of a
courtmartlal. Blrrell'a resignation
was expected. He was forced from
tbo cabinet by a heavy fire from the
newspapers and public.
It Is understood that the resigna
tions ot General Friend and Under
Secretary Nathan will follow, All

lii Paso, May 3. American troops
are to remain in Mexico, without in
terference from Carranzlstas, accord
ing to an agreement by War Minister
Alvaro Obregon and General Hugh
Scott, chief of staff of the United
States army, after a conference last
ing 12 hours. The agreement was
reached at midnight.
In a statement issued earlier in the
evening both said that negotiations
would probably result in satisfaction
to all concerned.
General Funston was eliminated
from the conference. This was ob
vious, although no official objection
to his presence was given. Funston
strolled about the lobby during the
meeting, and this pointed to Indica
tions that the negotiations had been
robbed of their military aspects.
Funston was reported to have clash
ed with Obregon during the first con
ference. Obregon granted permission tor
the expedition to have full use of the
Mexican Northwestern railroad and
promised to cooperate at fully as Is
nosslble with General Pershing and
hla forces, It was stated reliably. In
return, 8cott Is unofficially reported
to have set a sixty-day limit on the
presence of American troops in Chi
huahua. Scott's concessions are not
definitely known, however, and It is
belteved the war department will
shortly give out the program agreed
upon. '
Emerging from the conference,
Scott went to his private car and dis
patched a long telegraphic report to
Washington by special wire. Whether
there would be additional conferences
is not definitely known, but both war
leaders are expected to remain on the
border for some time, Scott Indi
cated that the attitude ot Washington
would decide whether another meet
ing would be necessary. Obregon
was silent. , An indication that the
conference was Teaching an amicable
adjustment was soon early when Ob
regon came from the meeting. When
Obregon returned to the conference
room, Adolfo do la Huerta dictated
the following message to Carranxa:
"Information Is negotiations now
In progress will terminate complete
pidity. It Is believed that tbe rebels
who fought In the ranks will be leni
ently treated.
It was . Intimated that tbe third
rebel executed, signed the proclama
tion of an Irish republic. Follow
ing are those who signed that docu
ment besides Connolly and Pearse:
. Thomas J. Clarke, Sean Mac
dlarmad, Thomas MacDonough,
Bamon Coaunt and James Plunkett.
Other signers of the Irish republic
proclamation were sentenced to three
years' imprisonment 1
Pearse waa a highly educated man,
headmaster ot a boys' school In Dub
lin. He led the assault on the post
office, which resulted In Its capture.
On Thursday of last week he was
wounded In the leg and surrendered
unconditionally. Later he Issued a
proclamation calling for his follow
ers to drop their arms.
Connolly was also wounded. His
name was found signed to a number
of passports discovered on prisoners,
with the title, "Commander Of the
A'rmy of , the Irish Republic." . ,
satisfaction all concerned."
President McQuatters, ot the Mexi
can Mine Owners' association, ar
ranged the last conference. He is
the head ot a company owning large
mines In Parral, which were looted
recently. McQuattera invited Obre
gon and Scott to luncheon at the Del
Norte hotel, ostensibly to discusB the
tendency of Mexicans to blame the
de facto government for lack of em
ployment. Obregon came openly, Scott sur
reptitiously. Obregon Impressed
Americans here as being the strong
est Mexican ever seen on the border.
It was stated definitely Hhat there
would be no conference today, Scott
awaited word from Washington offi
cially approving the plan he outlined
In dispatches. Pending action ot the
state department no further progress
was authorised. Scott expects a reply
tonight. A "clean-up" conference is
In prospect tomorrow.
Scott and Obregon made respective
supplementary reports. Scott's waa
long and waa belteved to amplify the
Information contained In the first re

Mexican officials were relieved to
learn that a tentative settlement had
been made. Carranzlsta military men
were counted on to lend full coopera

HUTTOfJ FOR LIBEL
. Portland, May 8. A libel suit tor
$50,000 damages against R. P. Hut-
ton, secretary of the Oregon Anti-
Saloon league, filed by Congressman
C. N. McArthur, was on file here to
day. In the same suit McArthur de
clares a portion of the Oregon pro
hibition law Is unconstitutional.
The suit is the result of a political
squabble. When McArthur refused
to declare himself In favor ot submit
ting a national prohibition amend
ment to the voters, Hutton Issued a
circular attacking htm. In the same
circular Hutton extolled the virtues
ot E. V. Littlefield, MoArthur's prin
cipal opponent.
McArthur's suit declares that
Littlefield, as chairman of the com
mittee on alcoholic traffio In the state
legislature last year recommended
the passage of the present prohibi
tion law with alleged unconstitution
al provisions. The portion ot the law
which permits drug stores to sell
grain alcohol, McArthur asserts, vio
lates the constitutional amendment
which says that no alcohol shall be
sold within the state.

Washington, May 8. German Am-
oassaaor vontvernsiora is so conn
dent that the kaiser's reply to the
American submarine demands will be
satisfactory that he completed plans
today to remain in Washington all
summer. Apparently he bases his
belief, however, on the willingness of
this government to 'negotiate" fur
ther. Strong indications that the
United States believes negotiations
like those in the past are at an end
may upset the ambassador's plans.
An indication of this was authori
tative information that no single
communication from Secretary Lan
sing bearing on the submarine issue
and the armed merchantman pro
nouncement has been sent to Ambas
sador Gerard at. Berlin since Presi
dent Wilson's note was forwarded.
All messages, it is known, have dealt
with other subjects. ,
Private advices from Berlin to the
German embassy reiterated advices to
the United Press last week that dan
ger of a break in diplomatic relations
had passed. The embassy believes
that this indicates formulation of a
reply which ia expected to satisfy the
president The reply that is .appar
ently anticipated, however, is one
that will call for continued conversa
