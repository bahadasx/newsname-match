"One day Lincoln asked mu to ride
fifteen miles out In the country with
him nnd become a witness to a will he

ho would not read a few verses out of
the Hlble to her. They offered him the
book, but ho did not take It. but began
reciting from memory the Twenty-third
Psalm, laying especial emphasis upon
Though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me; thy rod and thy
stalf they comfort me.' Without the
book he took up the first part of the
fourteenth of John, 'In my Father's
house are many mansions.' After he
had given these and other quotations
from the Scriptures he recited several
hymns, closing with 'Hock of Ages.

Of Glen Dean, Writes in Reply
to County Attorney's Article
Recently Published on Road
Bonds.
Dear Mr. litbb.tge: Having recently
read our Count) Atmrnej's urlicle in
your paper in regard to calling for road
bonds, it eems tome that there is a
better way than thU. Should there be
an election called, who would vote on
the Umt? The voters if the county, of
course. Hut who will lay the tax, the
property holders to be sure; thus allow
ing people to vote that never would
pay a cent of the tax. It eims to me
that the tax-payers of the railroad dis
trict at least would fight Mich an elec
tion to the last ditch, tor we ate now
pajinga tax that was voted on us by
voters who have never bet 11 called to
pav one cent of this tax because they
have no property.
If it is necessary to call Mich an elec
tion, then allow tho voters affected by
such bond issue to vote on it. This
ro.nl proposition, as Mr. Murray says,
lias been worked many ways, but I
think never properly in the first place.
There is a road supervisor that I think
the tax payers would be much better
off without. He certainly has done but
little toward the betterment of the
roads in our section.
Now, I for one, am in favor of doing
away with the supervisor nnd having
the County Judge appoint an overseer
on each road and give each overseer
the money paid on his road, and such
overseer give bond for said amount,
and have him to turn in an itemized ac
count to said County Judge; also said
overseer to serve without pay, hencti
giving the road the benefit of the whole
amouut. It seems to me when a crew
of men knoiv they are getting all the
tax money they pay that they would
take more interest in their roads, but as
it is now, manv of tho roads do not get
a cent, which to say the leas.t, is very
unjust. I know some few public spir
ited men have donated some on their
roads in order to get help from the
county, and agteat many more that
should nave done so, but it has ever
been the case that few have the burden
to bear.
J. G, Moorman and myself have
pulled the grader free of charge for the
past two years hauled it from the
Falls of Hough and what have we re
ceived from the count? Four culverts.
Hence I think justice demands that ev
ery road have its own tax money. Let's
toy giv'ng the tax-payer the benefit of
his taxes without having so many take
outs, nnd see if the roads won't be
found in better condition in one year
from now.
Yourr for good roads, and willing to
give as much free labor as I feel justi
fied in doing.
Respectfully,
W.J. Robertson,
