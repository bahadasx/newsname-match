T LHASA'S new city offlcluls, pledged

After Mr. Hunt had announced

make before the oath of office was

"The charter provides that we shall
be responsible to the people of this
municipality for the conduct of our
offices," he said, "and unless we in
tend to do this there is no use In us
taking this oath. I believe that we
understand and this am I not right?
"I for one will make my work ac
ceptable to the people who have
chosen me for this office. I am
their servant and as such will de
vote my time to their will, even
though it cost me, as I know it will,
$S,000 a year. My office Is the peo
ple's office, in which I will conduct
the business of the people, as far
as the charter will permit me to
do so."
After declaring- that each commis
sioner should give all of his attention
eight hours a day to the depart
ment of which he was head, the new
mayor announced that he was ready
to take office.
fteliring Mayor Hunt then read the
oath, which was signed by each of the
new officials, and they took their
toiuls about the commissioner's table.
Honnrtment Heads.

WASHINGTON, May 2. The na
tional conservation congress
met here today with a threatened
fight on Its hands similar to tho one
that nearly split the organization at
Its last meeting three years ago and
which ended in victory for Oifford
Pinchot and others who opposed re
moving from public ownership any of
the country's undeveloped water pow
er sites.
Majority and minority water power
committee reports promise to preclpl
tate the clash tomorrow. Speeches at
todtj's sessions by conservationists
from manv parts of the country were
overshadowed by the prospects of the
fight considered Inevitable.
The majority water power report
will recommend endorsement of the
Shields bill now pending In congress
which would permit construction of
dams in nnvigable streams under li
censes issued by the secretary of war
and give grantees the right to oper
ate power plants for fifty years.
Minority members of the water
power committee who oppose the
Shields bill are a part of the Pinchot
element.

WAS THE THIRD TRIP
Dined With Chamber of
Commerce at Okmulgee
and Had Auto Ride.
DESPITE an jixaggerated attack of
Inclement weather one hundred
Tulsa boosters completed the third
trade extension excursion yesterday,
spending 13 hours on the road. Ok
mulgee and Muskrgee were the prin
cipal stopping points, intermediate
cities being Sapulpa. Kiefsr, Mounds,
P.eggs, Preston. Morris, Eram. Boyn
ton. Taft. Haskell Leonard, Blxby
and Jenks.
The invasion started with flying col
ors and band playing at 7:30 o'clock
yesterday morning from the Frisco
depot. The crowd was good, the train
was supplemented by a buffet car,
every one waB In thj official uniform
of duster and palm beach hat, and
prospects seemed bright for a very
successful Journey. And then it
rained and rained.
Not until Haskell on the home
stretch .was reached was a visit made
without competition on the part of
J. Pluvlus. Notwithstanding dripping
r.pparel the 'rooperu proceeded with
undumpened spirits and not a station
was missed.
Wuini Itcccptloii
On the whole the reception accord
ed the excursionists was very warm
considering the handicap of poorly
limed showers and mud. The out
standing feature of the trip, hbwpvcr,
was the hearty welcome of Okmulgee
throuhg the chamber of commerce
of that city.
Although rain was pouring down
when the Tulsa special pulled In. the
visitors found ample accommodations
to convey them to the leading hotel.
The Tul.ians. however, proclaimed
themselves as true optimists and
staged the regular parade for six
blocks up the main stret of the city.
The Okinulgeans then took their
guestB over the city in automobiles,
returning onlv for a Bumptuous meal
at the Parkinson hotel. Itev. J. R.
Abernathy of the South Methodist
church delivered the address and wel
come for Okmulgee and E. O. TU

Oct Ilig Surprise.
The boosters experienced the great
est surprise of the entire series of
trips when they saw the status of Ok
mulgee business. Built around the
historic capital of the. Creek nation,
this is fast becoming a city of good
proportions. There is building all over
the city Including a $150,000 high

Troops Retire.
U. S. CONCEDES POINT
Production of Villa's Rody
by Mexico Might Sat
isfy Americans.
WASHINGTON. May 2. From
Mexican sources It was learned
today, that, based upon the immed
iate withdrawal of the American
troops General Carranza has of
fered to place an active army of
twenty-five thousand men in north
ern Mexico as soon as tho Ameri
cans are withdrawn; The offer was
accompanied by assurances, it is said,
that more than half of the force
would bo so placed as to guaran
tee border towns from future ban
dit raids, while the remainder would
be used In a vigorous pursuit of
bandits until the whole territory
adjacent to the border had been
absolutely cleared of these outlaws.
It was the condition of Immediate
American withdrawal, it is under
stood, which led to the interruption
of the El Paso conference while
Generals Scott and Funston laid the
situation before President Wilson.
They had no power to deal on that
basis.
Slake Concessions.
There is reason to lielieve t lit t the
American officers now have author
ity to make concessions In the way
of limiting the sone in which Gen
eral Pershing's forces will operate
until a demonstration has been made.
Such questions as that of using the
Mexican railways to supply the
American troops also may be waived,
it Is understood, It they embarrass
the de facto government in its do
mestic relations. The American
army officials are confident of their
ability to maintain the shortened
supply lines by motor truck.
Just what would be required in tne
way of a demonstration by the Mexi
cans Is not known. The production
of Villa's body or of positive proof
that he has ceased to lie a factor In
the situation through death or any
other cause undoubtedly would weigh
with officials here. The bandit has
been the only figure among the out
laws of the border region who could
gather about him a force sufficient
to menace the relations between the
two governments. It is understood,
however, that at the El Paso confer
nece a broader ground has been taken
than the mere (iiicslion of Villa's
elimination and that the establish
ment of permanent relief from outlaw
raids of any sort Is aimod ut.
Danger of ( lashes.
In explaining General Carranza's
reasons for not taking Immediate
steps toward further co-operatlon In
the pursuit of the bandits, his repre
sentatives have pointed to the fact
that an- movement of Mexican troops
In the region where the American
force has been operating has been
the subject of Instant suspicion by the
American press and also of military
reports to the war department. In
addition they point out the Increasing
danger of clashes between the two
forces.
Secretary Lansing and other offi
cials were asked today if they had
received Information that so-called
interventionists In El Paso and else
where along the border were un
usually active during the military
conference. They replied that no
new indications of such activity had
been received.

posed principally of foreigners, at
tacked the Edgar Thomson works of

dock. A pitched battle followed last
ing an hour, during which four hun
dred shots were fired but the rioters
finally were forced to retreat in the
face of a deadly fire from the riot
guns of deputy sheriffs and plant
guards.
Both tho men who were killed and
a majority of the wounded were
mem hers of the mob but the authori
ties have not yet determined if they
were strikers. A number of pedes
trians also were hit by stray bullets.
The situation is quiet tonight but
two thousand citizens of the borough
have been sworn In as deputies and
are patrolling the streets. District At

er quiet had been restored Injured
continued to be brought to hospitals
tor treatment, snipers hidden in door
ways and windows tried to pick off
ucpuues wno were fighting to hold
buck the mob and two deputies were
said to have been hit. Women also
joined in tho mad fight to gain entry
to the works and two of these were
wounded.
The two men killed were foreigners.
The mob first altacacd the olfice
of W. J. Dixon, superintendent of
transportation at the Edgar Thom
son works, and with clubs and stones
wrecked it. Deputies rushing to pre
vent the destruction of tho office were
compelled 10 use it as a barricade, and
from behind tho wreckage they
poured t:hnt after shot into the mob,
which withdrew. After stoning tho
plant fur 4.'i minutes, another charge
was made and in a hand-to-hand
struggle the deputies and guards were
forced back inside the plunt.
IHsM'ix- Strikers.
After a fierce buttlo which ruui'd for
several minutes tho mob was forced

In response every man of the night
