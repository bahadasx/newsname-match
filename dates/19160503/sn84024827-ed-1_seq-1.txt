BERLIN. Via London. May 2-
Herr von Jegow, the foreign min
ister at the re-opening of the sit
ting of the budget committee of
the Reichstag: today, said the gov
ernment had not yet reached a de
cision .with regard to the situa
tion that had arisen rrom the
American note to Germany re
garding Germany's submarine
campaign. As soon as the imperial
chancellor returned from head
quarters, Herr 'jn Jagow added,
he would give the committee de
finite information.
BERLIN", May 2. It has been
learned that Dr. Karl Helferich,
the imperial treasurer, is at the
, headquarters participating in the
conference on the American note.
The Frankfurter Zeitung says
Ambassador Gerard twice dined
with imperor William and that be
' was able to see the German troops
at an important (,'jint on the front.
WASHINGTON. May 2 Two weeks
have passed since the United States
addressed to Germany its note that
a change in methods of submarine
warfare be made, and still no definite
answer has been received.
Privately no attempt is made to con
ceal a contrary feeling and this feel
ing is certain to Decome more p.m
ounced unless some definite news is
forthcoming over night.
Parleying Expected.
It is felt here that the very length
- of time which has been consumed by
the German government in preparing
a reply in itself indicates that the
communication will not take the
Qhano if a sininle resnonse to the
direct and clear cut issue raised in!
the American note. It is feared that
the reply is likely to assume an argu
ment character which can scarcely
be regarded as meeting the require
ments of the United States.
Persons in close touch with affairs
at the German embassy, however,
continue to express themselves as be
ing positive that Germany will make
no reply to the United States which
will call for the breaking of .diplomat
ic relations.
It is felt in German circles that
Germany certainly will agree to
abandon operations objectionable to
the United States at least pending
negotiations on the subject. In this
connect.'jn it is pointed out that
there even is a possibility that in
structions to this end already have
been issued to submarine command
ers, there not having been reported
during the last few days a case which
could be complained.
It is reiterated that all messages
from Berlin foreign office clearly in
dicate that Germany is trying to pre
serve friendly relations with the
United States.
Of course, it Is realized that the ab
sence of Mr. Gerard from Berlin
probably without his code and his
probable reluctance to entrust confi
dential telegrams to the German mil
itary authorities may have accounted
for the lack of communication. Secre
tary Lansing has no information to
lay before the cabinet at the meeting
today and the situation was discussed
only briefly. It was the first time in
a week that the secretary had appear
ed at a session of the cabinet without
a portl'Jlio filled with documents.
TWO MORE STEAMERS

LONDON, May . 2. Two steamers

met with mishap at sea.
The British steamer Heddon Hall

This statement was signed Ob

and Mexican cimt'erees consider

tiens in Mexico, according to un
official bu authorative advices.
It is believed now the matter. my
be threshed out In the next day
or so.
This progress was due to the
fact, it was said, that General Ob
regon concluded there was no
possibility of altering the' inten
tion of the Washington govern
ment not to withdraw General
Pershing's expeditionary force
immediately.
The attitude of the Mexican
minister of war is believed to
have been described by a Mexican
official w.io took part in the first
. conference in Juarez, who is close
ly conversant with the entire sit
uation and who said:
"Between two evils you must
choose the lesser. It would be
felly to suppose the defacto- gov
ernment desires war."
To Come Half Way
it was gathered from this that the
Mexicans had decided not to press
the question of withdrawal in view of
the possibility that a break might fol
low. The negotiations today took an
entirely unexpected turn. In the morn
ing it- was announced that there prob
ably would be a meeting in the after
noon with General Scott and Funston
representing the United States as In

Obregon and Trevino representing
