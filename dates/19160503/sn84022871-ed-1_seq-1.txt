The text of the morning sermon was
II Kings, 3-16, the subject, "Digging
Ditches." We may Ivy cur plans but
if we work without God &11 of our
effort will come to naught. We choose
our own course, work in our own way,
and when misfortune overtakes us we
curse Providence. Man is to have
a part in doing God's work in this
world and he must do it in accordance
with the will of the Ruler of the uni
verse. God will never do for us what
we can do and ought to do for our
selves. God interposes his power only
aftr men have done their part. The
work we are called to do may seem
useless, unreasonable and absurd, but
God has His reason for demanding it of
us. We ought to be more earnest in
our religion. . We play at it too much.
How much do people think our religion
is worth judging by what we do snd
say? As a church and as individuals
there are ditches which need digging
and we shou'd be hard at work prepar
ing for the showers of thn future
The evening talk on text taken from
Proverbs 30-25 drew lessons to be
learned from one of our mUle&t
insects. Trey show foresight, provid
ing themselves in summer for the
winter time. They recognize their
opportunities and make the most of
them. Everyone has a season for
shaping his future although to some
this may be shorter than to others.
Man seems never to have learned the
value of time. One-half of his under
takings fail, because he spent so much
tim3 talking and planning where if he
would go to work he would be surprised
to see what he could accomplish.
There is one thing for which we must
find time and that is to prepare for
eternity. If there be no preparation
here we shall have no promise for
another opportunity.
One hundred and one in our Sunday
school. Come and make the number
more next Sunday.
We are having interesting and help
ful Epworth League meetings and our
young people are urged and older
people invited to attend that they may
help and receive help.
Remember the prayer meeting on
Thursday evening. Come and help dig
a ditch.
Reverse Automobile Case.
In supreme court at Montpelier Tyes-
terday the case Raymond Aiken vs.
Oliver Metcalf, judgment was reversed
and cause remanded in a decision writ
ten by Judge Powers. The case grew
out of an automobile accident in the
town of Irasburg, the plaintiff being
injured when struck by 'a machine
while crossing the street. In the lower
court the verdict was ordered for the
defendant by the court. In his opinion
Judge Powers held that the plaintiff
exercised the care of a prudent man
before he crossed the streeet, that the
evidence showed that he looked in a
southerly direction before he attempted
to cross the street and failed to see the
automobile which struck him 20 seconds
later. The plaintiff had nearly reached
the other side when struck and would
not have ordinarily been looking for a
machine to be coming from the direc
tion indicated on the wrong side of the
street.
