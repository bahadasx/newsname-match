PITTSBURG, Pa., May 2. Two
men are known to have been killed,
four probably fatally wounded and a
apnr nf nlhprs Rerimislv hurt this
afternoon when a mob said by the '
authorities to have been composed
principally of foreigners attacked the
Edgar Thomson Works of the Car
negie Steel Company in Braddoek.
A pitched battle lasting an hour
followed during which four hundred
shots were fired, but the rioters were
finally forced to retreat In the face
of a deadly fire from the riot guns
an", revolvers of sherltfs and plant
guns. The situation is quiet tonight
hut 2,000 citizens of the borough have
been sworn In as deputies and are
patrolling the streets. District At
torney R. If. Jackson announced that
he would take steps at once for the
the deportation of all foreigners

The riot wa the climax of a day
of disorder In the boroughs of Brad
dock and Rankin during which mobs
stormed tho plants of four big steel
companies, drove the workmen out
and then rartly wrecked the Interior
of the plants.
Many of these Injured In the fight
ing at the Edgar Thomson works
were spirited away by the rioters and
for hours after quiet had been re
tored, injured continued to be
brought to hospitals for treatment.

who were fighting to hold back the

the mad fight to gain entry to the
works and two of these were
wounded. The two men killed were
foreigners.
The mob first attacked the office
of TV. J. Dixon, ' superintendent of
transportation at the Edgar Thomson
works and with clubs and stones
wrecked it. Deputies, rushing to pre
vent the destruction of the office

they poured shot after shot Into the
mob which withdrew. After stoning
the plant for 45 minutes another
charge was made and in a hand-to-hand
struggle the deputies and
guards were forced back Inside the
plant.
Deputies who had been on guard

Grave Concern Felt
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, May 2. Two weeks
have passed since the United States
dispatched to Germany its note de
manding that an abandonment of
present methods of submarine warfare
immediately be declared and effected
and tonight the state department still
was without any definite confirmation
indicating that the demand would be
complied with.
As the days go by and no reply

attitude of the .German government.
an air of grave concern is beginning
to manifest Itself In administration
circles. Privately no attempt is made
to conceal a contrary feeling and this
feeling is certain to become more pro
nounced unless some definite news is
forthcoming over night.
It is felt here that the very length
of time- which has been consumed by
the German government In preparing
a reply in itself indicates that the
communication will not take the
shape of a simple response to the
direct and clear-cut issue raised In
the American note. It Is feared that
the reply la likely to assume an ar
gumentative character which can
scarcely be regarded as meeting the
requirement of the United States.
Persons in close touch with affairs
at the German embassy, however, con
tlnue to express themselves as being
positive that Germany will make con
cessions to the United States that will
prevent a breaking off of diplomatic
relations.
They say the Berlin gov-
ernment has been advised
that the
United States meant Just
what
said in Its note and was not prepared
to enter Into any negotiations on the
subject of warfare until the present
methods had been abandoned.
GENERAL COMPULSION
DURING TERM OF WAR
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LONDON, May 2 Premier Asquitn
announced today to an expectant
parliament that the government had
at lust agreed on the much-discussed
recruiting question and had decided
on goneial military compulsion for the
duration of the war.
The premier claimed that the con
dition he had all along stipulated as
the only Justification for such a step
namely, general consent, now had
been obtained as provided by the
speeches delivered in the house of
commons last week when a bill pro
viding for the extension of military
service was Introduced by Walter
Hume )xng, president of the local
government board, and later was with
drawn. Mr. Asquitn added that the minis
ters agreed that the needful men
could not be obtained by the existing
machinery, but that they were avail
able and could readily be spared by
the industries assential for the suc
cessful prosecution of the war. Hav
ing given interesting details of the na
tion's success in its prodigious effort
in raising five million men for the
army and ravy, the premier express
ed confidence that the bill proposed
would end, once and for all, the pro
longed controversy and, in general

WASHINGTON, May 2 Develop
ments here in the Mexican situation
tonight awaited advices from General
Scott as to his further conference with
General Obregon at El Paso. The war
department had received no report
from the chief of staff up to a late
hour.
Administration officials declared the
situation to be unchanged in any re
spect after President Wilson and his
cabinet had conferred at the regular
Tuesday meeting. Secretary Baker said
late that General Funston's original
orders to pursue the Columbus raid
ers into Mexico still stood, as did the
original purpose of the expedition.
There was no indication tonight of
any change in the determination of
President Wilson not to accept any
proposal of the Carranza government
conditioned on the immediate with
drawal of the American forces in Mex
ico. This element of the suggestions
presented by General Obregon at the
military conference and by Eliseo Ar-
rendondo. General Carranza's ambassa
dor designate here, has also so far
proved a stumbling block to an agree
ment for wider cooperation in the
bandit chase, the object of General
Scott's discussions with the war min
ister. From Mexican sources it was iearned
today that based upon the immediate
withdrawal of the American troops
General Carranza has offered through
his two representatives to place an
active army of 25,000 men in north
ern Mexico as soon as the Americans
are withdrawn. The offer was accom
panied by assurances, it is said, that
more than half of this force would be
placed as to guarantee border towns
from future bandit raids, while the
remainder would be used in a vigorous
pursuit of bandits until the whole ter
ritory adjacent to the border had been
absolutely cleared of outlaws.
It was the condition of immediate
American withdrawal attached to the
; offer it is understood which led to the
' interruption of the El Paso conference
