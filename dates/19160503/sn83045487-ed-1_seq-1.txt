.Obregon, Scott and Funston Come to Agreement
Carranza Troops Will Not Interfere Early Ter
mination of American Campaign in

:
El Paso, May 3. American expedi
tion will remain in Mexico without
interference from Carranzista troops,
according to an agreement reached
early today by Chief of Staff Scott
and Carranza War Minister Obregon,
after conference lasting nearly 12
hours.
Obregon has granted permission
for expedition to have full use of the
Mexico Northwestern railroad in
transporting supplies and men and
has promised to co-operate "as fully
as possible" with Gen. Pershing's
forces, it was stated on reliable au
thority. In return, Scott was unoffi
cially reported to have set 60-day
limit on presence of Americans in
Chihuahua. Scott's concessions, if
any were made, were not definitely
known, however, and it was believed
the war department would give out
program agreed upon in sort time.
Conclusions will not become effec
tive, according to the understanding
around the conference .room, until
ratified by respective governments of
the conferees. Though Obregon
was clothed with greater authority
than Scott, he will submit his report
to Gen Carranza, while Scott's part
of the agreement will be subject to
ratification by Washington adminis
tration. ...
