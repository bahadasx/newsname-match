Gen. Marcelo Caraveo Is
Among Those Net Present,
And U. S. Agents Worry
Has anybody seen Gen. Marcelo Cara
veo? The United States department of
justice has lost track of him in the
hurrv and bustle of the conference.
The department of justice does not
want Caraveo. It would much rather
not have him, but would like to know
where he sleeps and eats, and who he
happens to be meeting just at this par
ticular time.
Caraveo is not believed to be with
Salazar, for Salazar iR having enough
troubles of his own. with his 18 men.
Is Caraveo planning to join hands
with Salaxar? The secret service men
do not think so. It would be ery dif
ficult for Carev eo to join hands with
Salazar. In the first place, it would
mean getting near the American lines;
it would mean running into the troops
of Gen Bertani to the east of Casas
Grandes; and it would be hard to get
at him by way of Juarez
Where then is Caraveo? No reward,
but grateful thanks will be extended
bv the department of justice for his
location.
When Salazar was last heard from he
and his band of 23 were crossing the
railroad tiack on the Mexican National
railwav, somewhere between Villa
Ahumada and Moctezuma. At that time
it looked as if he either meant to attack
the United States army or skirmish
with Bertani's men. He did not stay
east of the Mexican National railway,
as ..things got too warm for him.

ever, at the El Paso conference, a
broader ground has been taken than
the mere question of Villa's elimination
and that the establishment or per

with Gen Obregon.
Obregon Cites Suspicions.
In explaining Gen. Carranza's reasons,
for not taking Immediate steps toward
further cooperation In the pursuit of
the bandits, his representatives have
pointed to the fact that any movement
of Mexican troops in the region where
the American force has been operating
has been the subject of Instant sus
picion by the American press and also
of military reports to the war depart
ment In addition, thev point out the
increasing danger of clash hot-maa,.
the two forces should both press their
campaigns against the bandits at the

If the American forces were with
drawn the Mexican spokesmen argue
the crushing out of brigandage would
become a matter of personal pride with
the Carranza commanders, whereas it
is now a matter of competition and
possible Jealousv which untii.i iti

In submitting the letter, senator
Tillman declared secretary Daniels
courted investigation if one was de

kind of sniping or guerilla warfare,"
said senator Tillman. "Therefore, I
content myself with asklnz that Fiske's
letter to the vice president he pub

how little there really is in bia utter

had much to do with his conduct. He
has brooded over what he supposed
to be his wrongs until he seems to be
obsessed and I really feel orry for
him."

Senator Lodge, defending admiral
FIske, said he thought an injustice
had been done the naval officer.
"The secretary of war has seen fit
on several occasions, ' he said, "to at

an officer of the highest rank He has

He has engaged in no guerilla war

right of an honest man, to protect his
reputation "

In his letter, admiral Fiske referred
to secretary Daniels's statement to the
