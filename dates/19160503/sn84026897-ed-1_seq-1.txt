VOL.81 EDGEFIELD, S. C., WEDNESDAY, MAY S, 1916 NO. 13
ATS?GUA WEEK.
Augusta Rallies From Ashes
and Will Devote One Week
to Mirth and Merry
Making.
After weeks of most strenuous
preparation Augusta is ready for
her festival to be known as Atsugua
week, after the princess of the
Uchee Indians, after whom the city
was named, the fun and frolic to oc
cupy the time between Tuesday
May 9 and Saturday May 13. When
the great fire occurred it was at
first feared thal Augusta would be
. unable to get together her resources
sufficiently to hold the festival but
by Herculean efforts all difficulties
have been overcome and now every
thing is ready for the great week.
Starts Noon Tuesday.
The formal opening of the pro
gram is unique and beautiful. The
Red Men lodges of the city are co
operating to make this portion not
only pretty but symbolical. Dis
guised as TJchees they will arrive
in the city at noon from up the
river and will take possession of
the city in the name of Princess
Atsugua. To them as conq .terors,
Mayor Littleton will deliver the
kevs of the city throughout the fes
tivities the Indians will play a
prominent part.
The first parade will be held
Tuesday afternoon, following a roy
al American salute which in itself
will be unique. Instead of the cus
tomary salute of cannon there will
be fired high in the air a form of
Pain's pyrotechnics wherein the re
port of the exploding bomb a great
flag of some nation of the earth
will be spread across the heavens
the last banner thus displayed
being a great American flag, thus
depicting the position of honor oc
cupied by the United States among
the nations.
The parade will be called the
civic, and will be participated in
by every civic organization in A\x
gusta.-?iii^ooat_-of -tbe-C-ily and .
,co"?hiy departments, the commer
cial and military bodies. Five thou
sand school children all in spring
di ess participate. Fully ten thou
sand people are expected to be iu
line.
Wonderful Decorations.
It is said that never has any
southern city been so well decorat
ed for anv fete as Augusta is for
this occasion. For days professional
decorators have been at work string
ing flags and banners across that
great thoroughfare known as Broad
street, eight stieet and that portion
of the city around Barrett Plaza
where the great hippodrome.is locat
ed. At night myriads of tiny color
ed lights will add their colorful ra
diance to the beauty of the scene,
and all day long thousands upon
thousands of banners, flags and
bunting will wave in the breezes
their colors, bright and gay, testify-!
ing to Augusta's renaissance. Ai
new Augusta has been born after
the baptism of fire and all ber citi
zens are desirous of showing how
wonderfully resourceful she is.
Four Parades Wednesday.
Four parades and pageants have
been conbined to make Wednesday
the big event of the week. First
there will be the allegorical pageant
.in which all the leading organiza
tions, lodges and firms of the city
will enter floats, some of which are
very costly and on which weeks of
preparation have been consumed.
Then there w ill be the automo
bile parade with a special section
for Fords, about five thousand of
. the cars alone being entered.
Next will come the floral display,
many beautiful cars beiug entered
by the ladies and gentlemen of the
city.
The final section will be the
trades display, some of the big firms
having silent large sums in endeavor
ing to outstrip competitors.
Thursday will be parade day for
the bicyclists and motorcyclists v\,h
races for the former on Broad st ?et.
More than sixty cash and merchan
dise prizes have been donated for
, these events and entries with the
result that hundreds of machines
and bikes will be in competition.
Friday will see the U. U. T. pa
rade. In many respects this will be
the most unique event of the entire
festival, for the traveling men are
backin?; this parade en masse and
planning to make it the most at
tractive and funniest of all.
Friday night will witness the
Two Marriages in Methodist
Church of Plum Branch.
On last 2nd Sunday morning at
10 o'clock Miss Coreen Walls and
Mr. Bradley Bowie, also Miss Mag
gie Med lock and ?dr. George Shrine
were united in marriage at the Plum
Branch Methodist church,Rev. Rob
ert Rountree performing the double
ceremony in the presence of a large
crowd of friends and relatives. The
decorations were simple but pretty.
The brides looked real girlish and
sweet in their white voile dresses
with trimmings of lace and ribbon,
as they marched up the aisle on
arm of their handsome bridegroom
to the strains of Mendelssohn's wed
ding mareh, beautifully rendered
by Miss Essie Bussey.
During the ceremony Miss Bus
sey played "Humoreske" very soft
ly. Immediately after the ceremony
the brides and grooms and a few
relatives and friends of Mr.and Mrs.
Bowie drove over to Mr. Walls, the
home of Mrs. Bowie, to partake of
a wedding feast 'which of course
was greatly enjoyed by all.
Mr. and Mrs. Bowie left on the
following day (Monday) for Don
alds, S. C., where they will make
their future home.
Mr. Bowie is prosperous young
farmer of Abbeville county.
Mrs. Bowie, nee Miss Walls, was
one of White Town's most popular
young ladies. She will be greatly
missed in the community.
We wish for these young people
pie a loug and happy life.

Very Low Rates.
The railroads entering Augusta
have granted very low rates for
this occasion. Three cents a mile
for the round trip has been granted
from all points in Georgia and
South Carolina the tickets being
good until the 15th of May for the
return trip.
Than Augusta no city in the
country is making a harder fight to
come back after the biggest fire
ever in the state of Georgia or even
in Carolina and it is expected that
all who admire her pluck and
energy will take advantage of the
big festival to visit Augusta next
week._
Our men's and boys' suits this

Miss Cain Closes School. Ap
propriate Addresses. Boun
tiful Dinner Served. Sick
ness in Community.
WiJl you allow rae just a littl
space in your valuable paper to tell
of a few happenings in our neigh
borhood.
The first and most important
thing ?s oui' farmers. They are need
ing rain so badly. Cotton and corn
have just peeped out and can't go
any farther without rain. The oats
have .despaired and are now head
ing out.
Last Friday our school closed,
after being taught a seven months'
term by Miss Ruth Cain. She was
assisted by the trustees in giving a
picnic, which was enjoyed by all.
We were glad to see so many of oar
friends come from Ed?etield, Tren
ton, Johnston, Colliers, Ked Hill
and Ropers. We had two ver> fine
talks from Senator B. E. Nicholson
and W. W. Fuller. Mr. Fuller is
v?ry iriueb interested in the educa
ting of the children. He also wants
to see; the school have grounds
improved so as to be attractive to
tue children. He said the county
would appropriate one hundred dol
lars ($100) and the Legislature one
hundred (Sl??) toward the work, so
we hope to soon see the trustees get
busy.
Senator Nicholson spoke of how
anxious fae was to see thc day come
when, every man would own his
own home. After being held for
an hour by the good speakers we
were invited to dinner, and we must
say there are not words ra the
English language that would give
due cr?dit to the grand feast spread
before ne, and the hundreds of gal
lons of ice lemonade. We had a
few candidates with us to shake
our hands.
We are sorry to know that some
men (violated the law so much as
to bring a buggy load of whiskey
to oaj^jnlc to sell.
We hope the trustees will be able
to persuade Miss Cain to return and
teach next term, for we all liked
her and hated to see her go. A
certain young man has had an at
tack of heart trouble since her de
parture and can't eat. He says the
ouly thing that he can relish is
sugar Cain (cane.)
We are all grieved to learn of
the illness of that sweet and amia
ble girl Miss Lila Roper, and hope
she will soon be able to return to
her school.
Mrs. J. N- Fair is also on the
sick list. She is very much missed
by every one as she has a smile and
kind word for everybody.
Miss Sallie May Miller is spend
ing a few days at the home of Mr
and Mrs S B Mays.
Mrs Carrie Mays spent Thursday
ni?, ht at Oak Grove.
Mrs P L. Ryau is spending a few
days with relatives in Graniteville.
Miss Elizabeth Wells spent Sat
urday aud Sunday in Edgetield with
her grand parents.
Mr Warren Fair is very anxious
to know what has become of all the
girls. Have they forgotten this ia
leap-year. He is still waiting, so
come along girls. You are letting
your goldeniopportuuity of life slip
by.
We hear that Mrs C A Wells is
soon to have a telephone put ra. Mr
Wells says if she talks any more
after she gets the phone he can't
stay in the house. Mr Wells is also
having water-works put in.
Mr Editor, for fear of taking up
too much of your time and space,
as I want to come again I will bid
you adieu.
