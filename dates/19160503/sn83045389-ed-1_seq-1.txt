PITTSBURGH. May 2.?Two men arc
known to have been killed, four prob
ably fatally wounded and n score of
others seriously hurt this afternoon
when a mob. said by the authorities to
havp beeti fuiiipos?*d principally of for
eigners, attached the Kilgar Thomson
Works of the Carnegie Steel Company
in Braddock. A pitched battle lasting
an hour followed, during; which 100
shots were fired, but the rioters- were
finally forced to retreat in the faeo
of a deadly tiro from the riot prims and
revolvers of deputy sheriffs and plant
guards. The situation Is quiet to-night,
but C.OOO citizens of the borough have
been sworn In as deputies, and are
patrolling the streets. District Attor
ney Jackson announced that he would
i take steps at once for the deportation
, of all foreigners connected with the
! t rouble.
The riot was the climax of a day of
! disorder in the Boroughs of Braddock
? and Rankin, during which mobs stormed
, the plants of four big steel companies,
'drove the workmen out and then partly
| wrecked the interior of the plants.

jbeen hit. Women also joined in the
? mad fight to pain entry to the works,
land two of these were wounded. The

i The mob first wrecked ar; office at
the Kdgar Thomson Works with clubs
, and stones. Deputies, rushing to pre

use it as a barricade, and from lio
j hind the wreckage they poured shot

The movement started early in the

bv Westlnghouse Electric and Manu
facturing Company strikers at East
j Pittsburgh to continue, their efforts to
bring out the workmen in the other
factories of the Turtle Creek and
Monongahela Valleys in support of
their demand for an eight-hour day.
They had been defeated In a similar
attempt yesterday, and the marchers
were angry when they set out. Pickets
stationed at a number of Braddock
factories had been worsted in encoun
ters with workmen as the men wero
going to work, and the plants of tho
American Steel and Wire Company, a
United States Steel Corporation sub
sidiary. and a number of other plnnts
had been shut down as a protection
to the employees.

Other plants continued to operate,
however, and when tho news was
brought to tho marching throng the
routo was changed, and they stormed
the buildings of the Sterling Steel
Foundry Company, whose employees
have been working eight hours a day
for some time. The workmen were"
driven out and much damage done.:
This success was quickly followed by!
| attack? on other factories in tho|
J neighborhood, the marchers continuing,
, their work of destruction at every!
place where the men refused to joinj
t hem.
By noon tlie crowd had swelled to
n mob of 2.000 persons, many of whom
wore visibly intoxicated.
Meeting no resistance, they marched!
to Hawkins station, where they at-:
i tacked the plant of the Nicholson;
Chain Company, employing 2.10 men.
Tiie frenzied mob swept through the
j plant, driving men from their machine*
and knocking down all who stood in
their way. Twenty or more workmen
were injured before they were finally;

Premier Asquith Makes Announce*
ment of Plan, Which "Will lie Put
Into Immediate Effect and Con

I .ON DON*. May 2.? Premier Asquith
announced to-day to an oxpcctant.
Parliament that tlto government had
sit last agreed on the much-disputed
recruiting question. and had decided to
introduce, a hilt for immediate general
compulsion for the duration of the
wn r.
Tim Premier claimed that the con
dition ho had all along stipulated nn
the only justification for such a step,
namely, general consent of l.he nation,
now had been obtained, as proved by
the speeches delivered in the llouse of
Commons last week, when a bill pro
viding for the extension of military
service was introduced by Walter llumo
1.011s, president of the local govern
ment board, and later" was withdrawn.

Mr. Asquith added that the ministers
agreed that the needful men could not
ho obtained by the existing machinery,
but that they were available and
could be spared from the Industries
for the successful prosecution of the
war. Having given interesting details
of the nation's success in its prodigious
effort, in raising 5,01)0,000 men for tho
army and navy, the Premier expressed
confidence that the bill proposed
would end. once and for nil, the pro
longed controversy, and in a general
statement of the war situation, chal
lenKc.d the bouse t.o indicate if tho gov
ernment bad lost the country's confi
dence.
The debate which followed the Pre
mier's speech showed that the bill is
likely to have a speedy passage, as it
met with general approval. A num
ber of Liberal and l.abor members,
however, said in effect that tlio bill
was not justified. They contended
that the government had been grad
ually driven from point to point by
the conscrlptionist press, and that
military necessities had nothing what
ever to do with the government's giv
ing way.
to ivrnoi>i-ch mi.)/
AT SESSION TO-n.VY
The bill will be introduced to-mor

The l.abor party is about equally

Irish Nationalists will take no part
In the division. There is no hint of
any Cabinet resignations or of the
f.abor members of the ministry seced
ing.
Sir Edward Carson, the Ulster leader,
during the course of his speech, said
he would not lend himself personally
to any attack with regard to the
Mesopotamian campaign, as he believed
that all departments were responsible
for It.

progress toward an agreement was
made to-day by the American and
Moxicnn conferees considering United
States' troop disposition in Mexico, ac
cording to unofficial, hut authorita
tive, advices.
ft is believed now tin; matter may
he threshed out in the. next day or
I so. This progress was due to the fact,
| it was said, that General Alvaro Obre

can government, had concluded there
was no possibility of altering the in
tention of the Washington govern
ment not to withdraw General Persh
ing's expeditionary forco immediately.
At S o'clock to-night, two hours af
ter the conference had begun, Major
j General Hcott handed the following
j statement to the Associated Press:
j "We are conferring in a spirit of
mutual gooil will, and hope to arrive
at a solution that will be satisfactory
to both of our government!!. There
will be nothing more for publication."
Tills statement was signed "Obregon

The attitude of the Mexican govern

closely conversant with the entirs
situation, and who said:
' Between two evils you must chooss
the lesser. It would bo folly to sup
pose the de facto government doslrea

It was gathered from thin that tha
J Mexicans had decided not to press tha
question of withdrawal with the poa?
