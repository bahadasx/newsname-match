The agreement was reached shortly

Obregon and Scott emerged smil

in the evening they had stilted joint

General Funston was eliminated

though no official intimation of ob

Chief of Staff Scott and War Minister Obregon
Come to Satisfactory Agreement
at Midnight.
[By E. T. Cpnkle, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
EL PASO, Texas, May 8.—The
American expedition will remain in
Mexico without interference from
Carranzista troops, according to an
agreement reached early today by
Chief of Staff Scott and Carranza
War Minister Obregon, after a con
ference lasting nearly twelve hours.
Obregon has granted permission
for the expedition to have full use
of the Mexico Northwestern railway
in transporting supplies and men and
has promised to co-operate "as fully
as possible" with General Pershing's
forces, it was stated on reliable
authority. In return, Scott was un
officially reported to have set a- sixty
day limit on the presence of the
Americans in Chihuahua. Scott's con
cessions, If any were" made, were not
definitely known, however, and it was
believed the war department would
give out the program agreed upon in
a short time.
The conclusions will not become
effective, according to the understand
ing around the conference room, un
til ratified by the respective govern
ment's conferees. Though Obregon
was clothed with gi eater authority
than Scott, he will submit his report
to General Carranza, while Scott's
part of the agreement will be sub
ject to ratification by the Washing
ton administration.

t'
Whether there will be additional con
ferences was not definitely known,
but both war leaders were expected
to remain at the border for the time
being. Scott indicated the Washing
ton attitude will decide whether an
other meeting will be necesary. Obre
gon was silent on this point
Indications that the conference was
bounding toward an amicable adjust
ment of international question were
seen early in the evening when Obre
gon came out of the meeting to talk
with Adolfo De La Huerta, recently
appointed civil governor of Sonora.
The pair withdrew and held a whis
pered consultation for several min
utes. When Obregon returned to the
conference chamber, De La Huerta
dictated a message to General Car
ranza, saying:
"My information is that the nego
tlations now in progress will termin
ate to complete satisfaction of all
concerned."
Arthur J. McQuattors, president of
the Mexican Mine Owners' associa
tion, arranged the confcrence. He is
head of the companv owning large
mines at Parral which were looted
recently by Mexican civilians, follow
ing the fight between expeditionary
troops and Carraaztstas. McQuat
ters employs Scott's son and Is per
sonally well known to Obregon. The
Carranza government has been
anxious to have mining operations re
sumed because the natives have
grown restless and turned to maraud
ing through lack of employment. The
American ownofs, at the same time,
were anxious to renew work, but
under existing internal Mexican con
ditions hesitated to expend large
sums in rehabilitating their plants.
McQuatters invited Obregon and
Scott to luncheon at the Del Norte,
ostensibly to discuss the Mexicans'
tendency to blame the defacto gov
ernment for their lack of employ
ment Obregon came openly, but
Scott slipped in to the hotel In an
effort to avoid being seen while his
secretary insisted for an hour that
the chief of staff was still In his pri
vate car.
Obregon has impressed Americans
here as the strongest Mexican ever
seen on the border. As a result ot
his handling of the negotiations with
Scott, he was looked upon today as
the coming strong man of Mexico.
It was stated positively there will
be no conference today. Soott await
