LARGE LIABILITIES
Grlswold & Mackinnon Have Made
Temporary Assignment Liabil
ities $257,000, Assets $198,000.
ATiieetfhg of the creditors of Grls
wold & Mackinnon was held in the
Avenue ,:House Wednesday. Repre
sentatives -of 12 banks from Richford
to Plymouth, N. H., besides a num
ber of Individual creditors, were on
hand and the meeting continued from
11.30 in the morning until 6 at night.
In a statement given out by represent
atives, the direct liabilities of the de
funct concern were given as $167,000
and assets of $108,000 were claimed.
In addition to the above indebtedness,
there are indirect liabilities of' up
wards of $90,000. Most of the latter
debts being represented by notes in
hand.
It was decided at the meeting to
appoint Jonas II. Brooks and Harry
Blodgett as trustees to look after the
interests of the creditors and counsel
for Griswold & Mackinnon, made ar
rangements to give these trustees a
deed of assignment. The business is
being continued under the manage
ment of Mr. Brooks and Mr. Blodgett
with the Idea of either effecting an
adjustment whereby the firm of Grls
wold fe Mackinnon may again assume
control of the affairs, or closing it out
for the benefit of the creditors. So
widely scattered were the debts among
the banks of Vermont and New
Hampshire, there being 12 in all, it
is not likely that any one bank will
be seriousl yeffected but several In
dividuals will be heavy loosers by the
failure. About 40 carloads of grain
which were on the siding here await
ing delivery to Griswold & Mackinnon
will be taken care of by the trustees
and it is hoped that not only will
bankruptcy be avoided in this case,
but that the business may be read
justed, and that a continuance will
be possible.
