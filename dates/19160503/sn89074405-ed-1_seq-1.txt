to overthrow the Jlmlnes government.
He has orders 0 Inform the men be
hind the Impeachment proceedings
against President Jlmlnes that the
United States will not tolerate their
intrigues.
Though framed to preserve the ap
pearance of legality, the movement
to impeach ths Dominican president
has been dlagnoeed by thf state de
partment as nothing more ...than a
transparent device to oust the gov
ernment in the? Interest of leaders
seeking personal advantage, There
fore, as the United States, by- treaty,
is responsible for tfts. maintenance
of the regular constituted authoritiee,
the state department' liaa already let
It be known through its agents In
Santo Domingo that it will not coun
tenance such an attempt to dislodge
Jlmlnes.
The Dominican treaty Is similar to
the conventions under which th« Unit

for the maintenance of constitutional
government In West Indian and .Cen

So It was dsemed necessary to deal

Boat Sank Tubantia,
London, May 3.—"The evidence
presented by the Dutch shipping coun

quoting the Handelsblad.
"Negotiations regarding the com
pensation for the sinking of the vessel
are proceeding," ths dispatch adds.
"Meantime Albert Ballln, director
general of the Hamburg-American
Steamship company, has offered to
transfer to the Dutch company a
large Hamburg-American line ship to
take the place of the Tubantia."
The Holland-Lloyd steamer Tuban
tl* was sunk off the tyordhinder
lightship ^leroh 4J. ass. rM»ljt pt an
explosion. Affidavits ot ofisesrp and
passengers said a torpedo was respon
sible for the dlsastsr in which several
persons were reported to have lost
their lives. The Dutch government

garding the sinking of the vessel and
later dispatched to Berlin a piece of
bronze found In a life boat of the
liner which the Dutch ministry of
marine believes to be part of a Ger
man torpedo.
The German government, while
denying that a German submarine
was the cause of the sinking of the
steamer, offered to collaborate with
the Dutch government in ascertaining
the cause for the disaster.

UPON NAHM OF THE NEW ORD01S
DEPENDS OUTCOME OF SITUATION
NOTE NEWLY BEADY FOR DELIVERY
Teutonic Position to be Stated Clearly so that Washington
Can Judge Must Abandon Present Policy
Maintains Administration.
Berlin, May 3.—The draft of the German reply to
America has been finished. The reply is subject to mi
nor alterations, which may result from interchange? be
tween Berlin and general headquarters.
The attitude of Germany will be stated in clear, pre
cise terms. The note will leave no room for doubt con
cerning the exact position assumed by Germany, which
will communicate the definite nature of the instructions
that will be given to submarine commanders and other
data on which Washington itself can judge the situa
tion.
The Associated Press is permitted to make thefe
statements, although the censorship on dispatches tend
ing' to reveal the tenor of the German reply still is ef
fective.
The date of the delivery of the answer has not been
fixed.
FIRST DEFINITE WORD.
Washington, May 3.—The announcement from Berlin that
and definite instructions are to be given to German nbawin*
mandecs is the first positive indication of how Germany will attempt
to meet President Wilson's final demand tbat she declare and effect aa
abandonment of her present methods of submarine warfare. Wheth
er the new Instructions will meet the terms of the last America 11 note
and thus prevent a break in diplomatic relations, can only be
mined by dose and careful examination.
PRESIDENT WOSOJi
TOW AS.EVER.
Prestdent Wilspn is represented by those closest
ShalcisnlhhU'd^termluaUon that the issue is not*:
tlcment oannot be delayed by-a illsimulim, of the .. ..
the British blockade and retaliatory measomi, and Uwt\ ^contro
versy between tlie countries can proceed further In dlpMamaoy only If
Germany Effectively stops the destruction of ships without warning, and
takes measures to bring her submarine operations otherwise within
the confines of International law.
MUST GIVE EVIDENCE OF ABANDONMENT.
With the declaration that such orders have been given, and If
there is evidence that they will be carried out in good faith, the
president ts willing to discuss the conduct of submarine warfare, but
only upon that basis.
There is no relaxing of the determination that the issue cannot
be further delayed and complicated by related issues, which will take
the discussion afield.
Until this morning Germany's delay in making a reply and the
absence of any definite report from Ambassador Gerard have led
American officials to fear that the Berlin foreign ofBoe was planning to
send an answer which the United States coold not consider other than
inconclusive, and. therefore, unsatisfactory. News that new instroo
tloits to submarine commanders will be announced screed to encourage
the hope of a favorable outcome of the long dispute, but all decisions
are being reserved until the newest German communication can be an
alysed and thoroughly considered. Until the president has had an op
portunity to consider it fully and finally, no one can aay whether It
will meet the requirements of the United States or avert a diplomatic
break.
