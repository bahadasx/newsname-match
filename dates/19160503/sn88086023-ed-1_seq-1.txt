Change of Venue
Denied by Court
in the Best Case
ATTORNS! Poll MAYOR 8AY8 AP
PEAL wild, BE TAKEN
FROM THE HI I. INC.
Justice of the Peace Joe H. Parkes
this morning denied the motion of
Mayor lames A. Hest for a change of I
venue and. while Judge Fee, attorney
for Ihe defendant, stated that ha
would appeal from the ruling. It la
probable the case will first come to
trial in the local Justice court. The
time for trial will be set later.
The demurrer filed by Mayor Best
to the complaint charging him wllh
the use of abusive and obacene lan
guage was overruled yesterday after
noon after a brief argument. The
defendant appeared In court this
morning at 10 o'clock and entered a
pleu of not guilty to the charge.
Immediately his attorney filed a
motion for a change of venue, basing
It upon an affidavit, signed by Dr.
Best, stating his belief that he could
pot secure an Impartial trial before
Justice of the Peace Parkes because
of the prejudice of the latter toward
him.
His counael cited the court to a de
cision of the supreme court and, con.
tended under It. that the court could
hardly do otherwise than grant the
motion. District Attorney Htelwer
held that the decision in question was
given In a case not parellel. His con
tentlon waa that the matter was dis
cretionary with the court and that an
Appeal ctnild be taken only from an
a base of this descretion. As to
v bethel or not Judge Parkea held
prejudice toward the defendant, he
stated, he would leave to the court.
Judge Parkes stated that the affi
davit waa too general and requested
that some showing of prejudice be
made. A recess waa taken while th"
mayor and his attorney made nn ad
dition to the affidavit. The addition
consisted substantially of the state
ment that Judge Parkes was preju
diced against the mayor because he
yea a candidate for city recorder at
the laat city election and did not re.
reive the appointment after the de
fendant had been elected mayor.
Neither Judge Fee or the district
attorney made any argument and
Mayor Best waa not preaent when tha
amended affidavit was considered.
Judge Parkes denied the statements
In the affidavit, declaring he hud not
lieen a candidate for recorder. He
stated that Dr. Hest had come to him

This yeur the peopte of Umatilla
county are paying $128,000 In road
taxes. Seventy-five per cent of this
amount, or practically a hundred
thousand dollars, la being spent on
the very roads which it la proposed
to improve under the bond Issue.
Practically this same amount was
spent on these same roads last year
and the year before and then the
year before that and for the laat quar
ter of a century the same proportion
of the road tax money lias been spent
on these same roads and what have
we today? We can go on for ever and
ever spending more money and more
money each year on these same roads
right up to the end or the world and
when the last trumpet Is sounded these
roads would be requiring more tax
money to put them In passable condi
tion for the last grand march.
The present tax levy In Umatilla
county for road purposes Is about twu
and one-third mills and under the
preaent system this rate must increase
each year as more roads come Into
service and demand repairs and up
keep. Under the bond Issue the tax
for the first four years is nine-tenths
of one mill, or 90 cents on each liotm
of assessed valuullorr. This is for
the reason that only the Interest Is

years. The average tax. figured on

the present valuation of $4 9,000,000
is only $2.04 per $1000 assessed val
uation, actually less than the present
road tax we are now paying. Aa the
valuation Increases thiB rate will de
crease; and it Is easy to see that the
average tax required to pay off this
bond Issue will not be two mills on the
dollar, will not be $2 00 on each $10t'0
of assessed vuluatlon. What do you
get for It? Tou get permanent hard
surfaced roads which require practi
cally no taxea for upkeep and main
tenance where today you people are
paying $100,000 annnaily in an effort
to keep these roads In a passable con
dition and then falling, for these roads
are not serviceable the year around.
Yuu know that from nere to Pendle
ton there are mans- and many days
In the year when you cannot hardly
get through with an empty wagon.
Then take It during tile dry summer
months when this road Is cut up and
worn down to the gravel In the mid
dle and out to the fence lines on each
side, do you call that a good road?
That Is the kind of a road you are
paying a hundred thousand dollars
year for For the same money you
can get that road hard surfaced so
that It will be open to traffic
of all kinds every day m the year
and the upkeep will eost you nothing
where today this road is taking Us
share of the hundred thousand dollars
for its upkeep.
Let me tell you something right
here In this connection, and this is
something you want to take home
with you and consider. The macadam
road from Pendleton to the State
IJne ha cost approximately $240
000. you who have traveled over It
know what Its preaent condition Is.
It is almost impassable. It will cost
$1000 a mile to maintain that road
as a macadam road. The heavy pres.
cut day traffic cuts macadam all it
pieces. It will not stand up under

ed why he has not recommended to
the president that all income tax re
turns be made public so as to enable
the checking of frauds. Keating said
he based his resolution on charges
made by Basil Manly, rrilef investiga

four hundred millions of dollars Is due
annually Instead of the eighty millions;
actually collected.
In Introducing the resolution Keal-j
