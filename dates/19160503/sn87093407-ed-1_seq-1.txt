3 IRISH REBEL LEADERS SHOT
' When the Brown Man Comes Without Warning'
LAST Friday The Star called attention to the reatneaa of the
Japaneae menace to our national aafety In our preaent atata
of unpreparedneaa, and urged a specific remedy—batter
coast defense*.
That this problem Is challenging the attention of the East, as
will as of the West, and that It Is no jlngolat bugaboo, Is Indicated
by the appearance In the New York Tribune of an article headed.
-When the Brown Man Cornea Without Warning," In which a
similar message Is voleed.
The Tribune accompanies Its article with a atatement that Ita
accuracy "la vouofced for by a ranking officer In the United Statea
army and a ranking officer In the United States navy." It aays:
It Is common knowledge to the world that
the policy of Japan is always to strike quickly and
without warning.
Without doubt, her warships will be brought
together in such a way as to allay suspicion, osten
sibly for a maneuver; and will be half way acroM
the Pacific before we shall have the slightest inkling
of the fact that Japan i« planning an immediate
attack.

It Is assumed that we could send our Atlantic
fleet, or a portion ot it. thru the Panama canal or
around South America in time to decide a naval
war with Japan.
It is very questionable it the patriotic Japa
nese living in the Panama canal zone would allow
our ships to pass thru the canal when it is possible
to prevent them doing so.
A small amount of dynamite could create such
a slide —even before we should have knowledge of
the contemplated innocent Japanese naval maneu
ver—that the canal would be blocked for months.
It we attempt to send our Atlantic fleet around
Cape Horn those battleships must be accompanied
by supply ships.
Even tho we have fighting vessels that can
make 21 knots, the tleet would have to be held
together.

WASHINGTON, May
3.—Secretary McAdoo is
directed to furnish con
gress with a statement
showing whether $320,-
000,000 is being annually
withheld from the treas
ury by income tax frauds
and evasions, in a resolu
tion offered today by Rep.
Keating of Colorado.
McAdoo is asked why
he has not recommended
to the president that all
income tax returns be
made public in order that
fraud may be checked.
Keating said he based his resold
lion on charges made by Rasit M.
Manly former chief Investigator of
the Industrial Relations commis
sion.
Manly. In a published statement,
declared thit more than $400,000,-
000 should be received annually in
stead of the $80,000,000 actually
collected.
The resolution asks whether
$15,000,000,000 was paid In wages
and salaries during 1914, $.">00,000,-
000 being paid to men receiving
$3,000 a year or more; whether
more than $300,000,000 yearly
above the K.OOO exemption la re
ceived as income from feea; wheth
ei f20.000.000 Is received as tocoma
from ownership of property and
the conduct of business above the
$3,000 exemption: whether Incomes
received by persons subject to In
come tax total $20,866,000 and
whether, with all proper deduc
tions. the figure should be $14,500,-
000.
In Introduces his resolutloa,
Keating said:
"You may discount Manly's
charges 50 per cent and still hav«
a sum which makes all other
frauds heretofore perpetrated seem
Insignificant.
"Three hundred and twenty mil
lion dollars represents the income
of 600,000 worklngmnn who have
labored every day In the year,"
