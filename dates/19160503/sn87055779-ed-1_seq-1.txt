WASHINGTON. May ".Two al
most Irreconcilable viewpoints on
the German submar.r.' controversy
were given utterance in official
circles todav. The first, coming di

many will accept the position of the

dispatches, tho president is state.! to

which under no circumstances tin

OPENS AUTO SHOW
. , .
200 Cars Take Part in Pro-
cession Marking First Day
of Dealers' Display.
Despite unfavorable weather con
ditions. South Rend's first automo- '
t ile parade, held in connection with
the opening of the four days' auto
show, pro . ed an important factor in
interesting the automobile buying
public in the new cars on the mar
ket this spring. There were about
"00 automobiles in t he march, head
ed by Libel's hand. The machines
were decorated with banners and
ribbons, displaying- to advantage
their meritorious features and call-
ing attention to the design and make
I of the various cars.
Lnthusiasm for the parade was
I not only apparent among the mem
! hers of the South Lend and Misha-
waka Auto Trade association, under
whose auspices it was staged, but the
public turn 1 ut in large numbers
t.t view the various machines all
along the route of the procession.
The parade started at 2 o'clock,
making a tour of the principal busi
ness streets of South P.cnd and
Mishawaka. disbanding where the
drivers with their cars returned to
the salesrooms to place them in the
.display windows. Infoima! recep
tions at the various sales rooms were
held after the procession broke up.
Poliev Chiefs lid-ad.
Heading the parade was a T'ord
car. driven by David Roswell-iti
which rode Millard Kerr, South
Rend chief of police, and Thomas D.
Kreiter. Mishawaka thief f police.
In the .-c onl car were the mem
bers of the committee . in direct
charge of the parade. Mr. Poswell
is the head marshal of the parade.
Following the two leading cars
came Libel's hand. the players
riding in a truck donated by the Stu
dehaker corporation. About half
way in the string of cars was the
Mishawaka Woolen . hand, rid
ing on a Service truck. These bands
alternated in playing in order
that music will be furnish d all dur
ing the time the parade is moving,
start at l.s-Hr Park.
After Libel's band the other cars
were placed in the ordr of their
arrjval at the starting place, which
was on N". Michigan st.. opposite
Peeper park. The itinerary of the
parade was worked out so that
jt j,:lfJS trle show room of every
dealer in Soutti Perj.l and Misha
waka. Although the shov rooms of alt of
the auto dealers ware open to the
public throughout the 1 iy. it was the
plan to have the formal opening of
the show come after th? parade.

decorated with a pennant showing
its make.

At the show rooms the dealers will

The governor's troop, of men.

morning to join the Sheridan
pea 11 belligerents. New lands insisted
today that the motive f the war
punishment of Serbia has been ac
complished and that the. belligerents
now seem hopelessly involved in
trench warfare. In his opinion a
renewal of Pres't Wilson of the of
fer f mediation made upon the re
quest if the highest legislative body
of the world's greatest republic,
hardly could be ignored and might
bring statements from both sides
that would furnish a common ground
from which peace might be discussed
and finally brought about.
Set's. SplciuPd Chance.
"There is a splendid chance in my
opinion," said Sen. New lands this
morning, "that a renewal of the of
fer of peace at this time might be
the means of opening the way for
th belligerents to settle their dif.
fren es. It is an opportunity which
should not be missed."
Sen. Phelan. one of the adminis
tration leaders in the upper house,
asked the committee favorablv to
re ommend his resolution dealing 1
with armament. Jt sets forth that 1
while the Uniteil States, because of
the developments of (he Luropean
war has been forced to take steps to
strengthen its army and navy, it re
affirms its faith in the policy of a
peaceful settlement of all interna
tional disputes by means of arbitra
tion and mediation.
According to Sen. Phelan such an
explanation is certain to do great
rood abroad, where the purpose of
ine i inie. i .-stall's emi arKing upon
a general preparedness
campaign
m:ght be misunderstood.

Crisis Postponed.
Although olhcials w ere greatly re-
lieved today to find that the confer-
ees were aide to reach an amicable
agreement, it was generally accepted
that the general Mexican crisis has
only been postponed. The Carranza
government again i. on trial. It
must demonstrate now:
I irst I hat U is sincere In its
promises to aid in eliminating Villa
and all
other bandits in northern
Mexico.
Second That it commands the
confidence of the country and can
really bring about a restoration of
industry.
Third That it can command the
money needed to rehabilitate tne
government and in every- way pro
tect foreign interests along the lines
promised when recognition was ac
corded Carranza.
There is an admitted element of
doubt in officialdom here as to the
ability of the de facto government to
do this. Conditions admittedly are
very bad all through Mexico. Hun-
dreds of people are dying ef starva-
tion and of disease and so far there;
hrts been no organized effort on the 1
part of the de facto government to !
combat these conditions. j
Ptvparv I 'or Any Iiie.
While Carranza is having his in- ;
ning it is understood that the United 1
States vv II make preparations for j
any eventuality. It developed today!
that the real reason why the Scott-;
Obregon conference was held was i
the reports made by Gen. Pershins
which showed conclusively that the;
Carranza troops were not only ham
, t, AlnerJoan m ovements. hut
actually were cooperating with ban-
j dits in certain sections. He insisted'
in his report that unless the Amer- ;
ic.an forces were to be withdrawn in
j a hurry he should be given authority
j to seize the railroads and dig him-
j self In. This th' 71re.si.Ient and hisi
'advisers were opposed to at the
Tlie administration lias been,
strongly opposed to calling out either
a volunteer army or drafting the na-;
tional guard for service in Mexico. !
If a real crisis In Mexuo can be
postponed for several 'months the
new armj bill will have become law:
will have been enlisted a
force of regulars sufficiently large,
with the aid of the navy, to under
take the pacification of Mexico. It
is known that two members of the
president' cabinet, who all aTnng
have held that intervention must
come, are very favorable now to ;
