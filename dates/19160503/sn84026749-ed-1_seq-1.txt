Woman Awakened
By Thief in Room
Burglar Becomes Frightened and
Escapes With $400 Before
She Gives Alarm.
Mrs. Thomas C. O'Sulllvan. of the
Mansfield. 1730 M street northweM,
discovered a burglar In her apartment
early this morning.
Mrs. O'Sulllvan was roused from her
sleep by a man moving stealthily
about the room and by the occasional
flash of a flashlight.
She did not scream. Instead she
tried to rouse Mr. O'Sulllvan. He war.
sleeping heavily, nnd her efforts were
detected by the Intruder.
He slipped down the hallway and
dashed out of the front door, as Mr.
O'Sulllvan ot up. Mrs. O'Sulllvan
told Headquarters Detective Patrick
O'Brien and precinct men that she
could give no description of the man,
and could not say positively whether
he was white or coloied.
It was found that the O'Sulllvan
apartment had been ransacked. The
Intruder carled with him when he es.
caped Jewelry and mohey to the val
ue of 1400.
Entrance to the apartment, which Is
on the first door, was gained through
an open side parlor window. The
burglar evidently took the precaution
of opening the frcnt door upon gain
ing entrance.
The police believe that the man Is
the "flat worker" who has ransacked
a number of apartments recently.
