As the result of a visit to this city
of members of the- 'ffew "tSngland
Freight ' Congestion committer to in
vestigate the condition of freight de
liveries, Bridgeport has been termed
the key. to a. larg percentage of the
transportation , congestion throughout
the: United, States - and eginning. to

i itive on, the New Haven and boat lines
' that will practically, shut off shipments
aind receipts' of everything but supplies
ifor hospitals, the' United. States gov-
;. eminent and food supplies for human
. .. consumption. ' '-
The embargo known specifically ; as
Ko. 232, supersedes all previous em
bargoes laid on either carload or less
'" than carload lots, closes the water
"lines andine transfer yards -against
.trains-shipment of goods and specifical
ly cuts Bridgeport from outside freight
. communication until conditions here
have materially cleared.' . v
The . Cbajnber of Commerce trans-
portatiorf committee will meet -at the
offices .of the chamber tomorrow morn
ing when means for overcoming' the
embargo at once will be (considered.- .
- A committee - from, the Chamber of
Commerce composed , of George Gove,
secretary of the body, and R'W.; Mil
iier, chairman of the jjtransportation.
committee, has arrangep a conference
with ; the , New1, ; England Congestion
, committee, composed of rejwesenta-
tives from all the larger eastern Tail-'
road lines. . ;' ' ,- 4
At this onference which Is to toe held
' ; in New York city on ' Friday morning
fthese requests will probably foe made
tfor Bridgeport's interest. . '-.
. In a preliminary investigation , of
, the freight situation in this city the
j Chamber of Commerce has ascertain
ied that on Monday last there were 710
unplaced cars in Bridgeport, of which
number 220 were for;- transfer at
Whiting street station and 115 for city
.delivery ,-- There were 875 jcars on
tracks for "which there was positively
no room on the -existing:" hulk tracks.
Thirty of these cars had arrived in
the city on one, day for -one con-
. -cern. ' - - ,y "' .
As ii would naturally be impossible
for one concern to unload such a
number of cars in one day, an investi
gation was made which resulted in
, exposing terminal conditions that the
locaf 'body t will ;'' endeavor to have
changed .through " the New England
Congestion committee. s ' V-
Many'of these cars and similar lots
for other consignees in this city-have
fceen held up by: embargoes on lines
connecting with the New Haven sys
tem. When embargoes were released
the New Haven was compelled to take
these cars offering first at the ferry
and rail lines. . The result was that
la rge builders and firms here found
themselves swamped with" unloading
that coHld not possibly be accomplish
ed under their own trucking facilities.
Appeals to other concerns raet with
rebuff because in times of depression
' the carriers had not been favored with
the business..
Among the freights in the yards to-
Say lumber and construction material
' shipments seem to be the heaviest. It
Is 'believed that -much of this freight
which is not affected; hy weather con
ditions could readily he stored in open
lets In which event the embargo would
' probably bo raised expeditiously. -
. Here is the announcement of" the
railroad: ' r -
First That "no discrimination
shall be made 'by outside rail

FEARED SEPARATION
BY ORDER OF COURT
Husband Finds Lifeless
Bodies in Bed Few Min
v utes Before Hearing.
. Ansonia, ' Conn., May 3 Fearing
tha't : the eight-year-old child which
she had brought up and mothered
since the little girl was a few days old
would be taken away from her by
the alleged rightful mother of the girl,
Mrs.! Augusta Holzwigr wife of Louis
Holzwig, of Walkers Court, this' city,
it is believed by the . police murdered
the cihld and then committed suicide
by cutting her own throat this morn
ing. - .
According to the story told by the
husband, he found them both dead in
bed when he returned from a trip to
buy clothing for his wife and the little
girl, ,-who were .-going to . the probate
court this morning where a hearing
was to be held on the child's adoption
by Mr. and Mrs. Holzwig. Coroner
Mix is investigating.
Police Chief Ellis and Medical
Examiner Dr. Lee Cooper- found 'that
apparently Mrs. Holzwig had stabbed
the chijd known as Adaline Geneva
Holzwig 'in the left sjde of the eck
with'VB. sharp pointed 'penknife and
then held the little girl until she had
bled to death, j After' 'that she evi
dently slashed her own throat with aI
razor . in such a way that death was
almost' instantaneous. The stab
wound In the child's - throat was not
sufficient to cause death except by
loss of blood. -
Behind the supposed murder and
suicide is the tale of a woman who
longed for a child, secured a three
days' old infant from a mother who
was willing to part with it and at that
time led her husband to believe it was
her own, brought it up. without the
formality of evt-r having adopted ' it
and then faced the possibility of the
real mother taking the little girl away
from her. It is believed that worry
over the chance of losing the little one
led to the tragedy. V" '

his talk before the Harvard Medi

Dr. Page. "Now we have put the
'bug into kissing. , Do you sup

"Why should we frighten court

from physicians which is mere
Speculation and does more harm
than good, and I can prove it."

The strike at the Crown Corset Co.

employes had quit their jobs. It now

The 100 girls who quit yesterday
called a general strike in the factory
this morning and few went to work.
The union leaders declare these will
quit as soon as they complete certain
operations on which they are work
ing. ' -
John Pierce, organizer of the gar
ment workers, had a conference this
morning with Supt Charles H. Wall
of the Crown Co. and Supt. Albert U.
Langenegger of the Batcheller Go.xuf
ter a mass meeting the girls.
No. agreement was reached. After
the conference, Mr. Pierce said:
"It begins to look as it we'll have
to call a strike of the Batcheller gins
to enforce the agreement we have.
"I had a, conference this morning
with' the superintendents and they
contend that the girls are seeking to
violate the agreement demanding a
closed shop. They are not. , It is a
question for the companies to consid
er whether one' girl or 500 is the
more important.
"No decision ' was reached and we
will now go over the heads of the
superintendents. , The men who own
the shop are the ones who must suffer
if there is a strike throughout xtheir
plants. Edward F. Russell of 'New
York is president of the Crown Co.
and the Batcheller Co. I will confer
with him this afternoon in New York.
"All the girls except about 50 are
out and they will' come out, when they
finish the operations on which they
are working. They don't want to
leave uncompleted work at their ma
chines." Superintendent Wall cbntends that
submission would be a violation of the
agreement with the girls for an open
shop. -
"Yoir might say the situation is 'in
statu quo," " he said today. "We had
a' conference this morning but ft came
to nothing.
"To discharge that girl would be a
violation of the agreement and .so

COKflEK
El Paso, May 3 Advices from Mex
ico City and Washington are awaited
todays to set the seal of approval upon
a provisional agreement that is under-
Wood to have been reached at the in
formal conference between General
Alvaro. Obregon, Minister ot War of
the- de facto government, and Major
General , Hugh I Scott, chief of staff j
of the United States army.
The conference was not ended until
after midnight and the two conferees
emerged from the meeting place in
good humor.- General Scott immedi
ately arranged for -the despatch of a
code message to "Washington giving
the details of - the understanding
reached with General Obregon.
This' detailed report is not expected
to reach Washington-until late today
and its consideration probably will
delay the answer to General Scott un
til Thursday. A similar report is be
ing sent First Chief Carranza. Be
cause of the difficulties -of Mexican
telegraphic transmission, it is
thought his' reply will not reach here
until after Washington has made 4ts
answer.
Neither General Scott nor General
Obregon would talk of the delibera
tions; in fact, they agreed to maintain
strict silence pending the next step
in , the negotiations. The reported
agreement is said to be based on the
general proposition that the Ameri
can troops' will further retire toward
the border and operate against Villa
bandits in a restricted district where
their presence and activities will not
provoke further hostility of the Mexi
can people. It is understood the
troops are to remain there until such
time as the administration at Wash
ington is convinced that the de facto
government is able to cope with Villa
bands.
Reports that the American troops
will withdraw in either thirty or sixty
days are in. no way confirmable.
