BERLIN NOTE
IN GIVING HER POSITSO
ON
SUBMARINE SITUATI
V Drafting of Answer to the
American Paper Is Re
ported Completed.
ATTITUDE MADE CLEAR
German Government Will
Leave No Room for Doubt
in Its Communication.
Washington. May 3.- Colonel
F,. M. House, President Wilson's
closest adviser, arrived here to.
day for a visit at the White house,
lie is expected U discuss the sub.
marine situation.
Berlin. May 3, (by wireless to The
Associated Press via Sayville, N Y.)
The draft of ihc German reply to the
American note has been finished. The
reply is subject to minor alterations
which may result from interchanges
of views between Berlin and general
headquarters.
The attitude of Germany will be
stated in clear and precise terms. The
note will leave no room for doubt con
cerning the exact position assumed by
Germany, which will communicate the
definite nature of instructions that
will be given to submarine command
ers and other data on which Washing
ton itself can judge the situation.
The Associated Press is permitted to
make these statements, although the
censorship on dispatches tending to
reveal the tenor of the German reply
Is still effective. The date of delivery
of the answer has not been fixed.
Are First Instructions.
"Washington, May 3. The announce
ment from Berlin that new and defi
nite instructions are to be given to
German submarine commanders is the
first positive indication of how Ger
many will attempt to meet President
Wilson's final demand that she aban
don the present methods of submarine
warfare.
Whether the new instructions will
meet the terms of the last Ameriean
note and thus prevent a break in dip
lomatic relations can only be deter
mined by a close and a careful exami
nation. Wilson Remains Firm.
President Wilson is represented by
those closest about him as unshaken
in his determination that the issue is
not negotiable; that a settlement can
not be delayed by discussion of side
issues; that the controversy between
the countries can proceed further in
diplomacy only if Germany effectually
stops destruction of ships without
warning and takes measures to bring
her submarine operations otherwise
within the confines of international
law.
With the evidence that such orders
will be carried out in good faith the
president is willing to discuss the
conduct of submarine warfare but
only upon that basis. There is no re
laxing of the determination that the
issue cannot be delayed further.
KxecU'd Unsatisfactory lieply.
Until this morning Germany's delay
in making reply and the absence of
any definite report from Ambassador
Gerard have led, American officials to
foar that the Berlin foreign office was
planning to send an answer, which
the United States could not consider
satisfactory.
The news that new instructions to
submarine commanders will be an
nounced served to encourage hope of
a favorable outcome of the long dis
pute. Gerard's Report Awaited.
The state department was still
without any report from Ambassador
Gerard today and has received nothing
since Friday. It was stated that in
view of the developments in Germany,
including Kmperor William's partici
pation in framing the reply, and the- J
American ambassador's visit to grand
headquarters, the length of time tak
en by the Berlin foreign office to an
swer the American note is not consid
ered unreasonable, but it was made
clear that unless euch important de
velopments had intervened to make
(or further delay it would not have
been considered that the American de-

Decision on
Mexico Case
Is Doubtful
r.l Paso, May 3 The tentative
agreement said to have been
reached between Major General
Huph L. Scott, chief of staff of the
Inited Slates army, and General
Alvaro Obregon, minister of war
in the de facto Mexican cabinet,
was generally understood today
to provide for a gradual retire
ment of the American forces in
Mexico.
El Paso, Tex., May 3. Advices from
Mexico City and Washington are
awaited today to set the seal of ap
proval upon a provisional agreement
that is understood to have been reached
at the informal conference between
General Alvaro Obregon, minister of
war of the de facto government, and
Major General Hugh L. Scott, chief of
staff of the United States army.
The conference was not ended until
after midnight and the two conferees
emerged from the meeting place in
rare good humor. General Scott went
immediately to his private car and ar
ranged for the dispatch of a coded
message to Washington, giving the de
tails of the understandings that had
been effected.
This report is not expected to reach
the secretary of war until late today
and its consideration probably will
delay the answer to General Scott un
til Thursday. A similar report is be
ing sent to First Chief Carranza. It is
thought the reply of the de facto gov
ernment will not reach here until aft
er Washington answers.
Neither General Scott nor General
Obregon would talk of the delibera
tions; in fact they agreed to maintain
strict silence pending the next step in
the negotiations. It has been suggest
ed that another formal conference
here may now be regarded as unnec
essary and that Mexico City and Wash
ingto will say the final word in the
settlement of the military questions
that have arisen out of the drive of
the American troops in Mexican ter
ritory. The reported agreement is said to be
based on the general proposition that
the American troops will further re
tire toward the border and operate
against the Vlllistas in a restricted
district where their presence and ac
tivities will not provoke further hos
tility of the Mexican people and to
remain there until the administration
at Washington is convinced that the
de facto government i able to cope
with the Villa bandits.

ARE SHOT
Provisional President of Ire

One Executed.
OTHERS SENTENCED
Three Signers of Rebel Proc
lamation Are Given
Prison Terms.
London, May 3, (3:40 p.
m.) Four signatories to
the republican proclamation
in Ireland have been tried by
court martial and found
guilty and were shot this
morning.
Patrick H. Pearse, the "provl.
sional president of Ireland," was
among those shot.
Three other signers of the proc
lamation were sentenced to three
years' imprisonment.
Premier Asquith made an an.
nonncement to this effect In the
lionse of commons this afternoon.
Anotlier of the rebels shot this
morning was James Connolly, who
was styled "commandant-general
of the Irish republican army."
Other signatories of the republi
can proclamation, found guilty and
shot were Thomas J. (lark and
Thomas MacDonagh.
Dublin, Tuesday, May 2, (via Lon
don, May 3, 12:33 p. m.) An official
statement issued here today said:
"Rebels considered suitable for trial
are being tried by a field general court;
martial under the defense of the realm
act. As soon as the sentences have:
been confirmed the public will be in-
formed as to the result of the trial.
"Others are being sent to places in :
England. Their cases will receive con
sideration later. The cases of women
taken prisoners are under considera
tion. "The work of dealing with these
trials is being proceeded with all dis
patch." A London dispatch on April 30 gave
the text of the proclamation issued
by the insurgents at Dublin at the
outbreak of the revolt with the signa
tures of Thomas J. Clark, S. MacDer
mid, Thomas MacDonagh, P. H.
Pearse, E. Sinnett, James Connolly and
Joseph Plunkett.
Holyhead, Wales, May 3. Three
hundred more prisoners from Ireland,
of whom 20 were wounded, were land
ed here early today. The prisoners
included a considerable number of
persons evidently of somewhat higher
station than those landed two days
ago. Some of them have been Identi
fied mainly with the Irish literary
movement. Others were clerks, sports
men, tradesmen or fanners. Most of
them appeared to be greatly exhausted.
Although the prisoners wore men's
clothing it was repcrted that several
were women, thirty or forty of whom
have been made prisoners. Only about
five per cent of the prisoners wore the
Sinn Fein uniform.
There are undoubtedly many pris
oners who are truthful in saying they
knew nothing of the impending revolt
when they mobilized. Whether that
will in any way mitigate their treat
ment by the government is not known.
A number of the prisoners indicated
their willingness to turn state's evi
dence and it is stated that some start
ling information will come to the gov
ernment from this source.
Dublin, May 3. The situation in
Galway resulting from the Irish re
volt has been serious, according to

miles of Galway when a naval vessel
shelled them from Galway Bay, com
pelling them to retire to Moyard Cas
tle at Athenry.
On the following day another naval
vessel landed 100 soldiers who forced
other rebels to retire towards that cas
tle. Encounters between the rebels
anil small hands of notice resulted ill
la number of casualties. Among those
arrested were Professors Steinberger,
Walsh and McEnri. all of the Univers
ity of Galway.

gratitude to the Irish regiments which
have so largely helped to crush the
uprising."
