State Auditor Dordon says he
can't make $11,000,000 rovenu
fit $17,000,1)00 in appropriations,
and we guess he is right. Hut
let us remember that i' was a

Certain significant events are
trnnspiring in Europe those days.
Russia is sending troops to
Prance, which can be taken as
meaning nothing else than that
Prance has exhausted her re
courses in men and eannot hold
her lines unless her ranks are
filhd ap from other sources.
Kngland cannot send more men
to France, for she has gone
ahout as far as she can without
, resort to conscription, to which
th' British public does not take
kin, -ly. Besides that Kngland
has t suddenly found herself with
a seri. a revolt in Ireland on her
bauds . VBl will need more men
there. India, it is said, also
menaces . Vr with revolt, which
may break out ny day. These
signs portcLvJ . hastening of the
and of the war. Germany can
not be beaten. '.'he effort to
atarro her inUr subnMasion has
failed, and her enenh should
be about ready to listen to her

No doubt the canned editorial

this is all a "Republican lie," and
that the state treasury is really
overflowing with fund.
In reply to onr latest note to
( reat Britain protesting against
the continued seizure of neutral
ships by that nation, the British
come back at us with a reitera
tion of their right and justification
under the circumstacesto perpe
trate these acts. In assuming
this attitude the British, the do
fendant in the case, arrogate
to themselves the right to act as
judge and jury in the case, and
of course render a verdict fav
orable to themselves. Our gov
ernment, with its revogaized pro-
English leaning, will accept this
abitrary rule of 'we do as we
please," under protest perhaps.
but without calling into force the
sterner methods with which its
seeks obedience of international
law and just regard for neutral
rights from Germany. N'e could

into a frame of mind to deal with
us on terms of greater fairness
were she not absolutely oertain
that our government, under the
direction of Mr Wilson, would
throw no clogs oC justice before
her in overcoming her enemy in
this war. Whatever grievous
ness befalls os from thus allow
ing Kngland a free hand in the
control of all ocean traffic during
the war will be nursed for such
soothing adjustment as she will
llov as after tb was is over.
Hut on? K8t certainty uoJer-j
lies all this one aiS concession,
and that is, we are going to hii?
a hard time petting hack from
our British friends uhat we have
given up to them in n weak spir
it of favoritism. We have allow

njay cost us dear.

Clark'i Lort For Wilson.
From the Month comes a de
fiant declaration of war. It
comes from the New Orleans
"Item," whose editor is the son-in-law
of Speaker Champ Clark,
and is thus a very significant
note. This newspaper devotes a
whole page to expressing its
sentiments in regard to Mr. Wil
son. It cartoons him as a weath
er-vane, with its weather eye op
en, whirling about in every di
rection, as the wind of political
popularity happens to blow, a!
ways keeping the weather eye
fixed upon the nominating con
vention and the campaign for re
election.
It begins its page on Wilsoaian
with this statement "We shall
calls very competent witness te
prove that President WU.on has
faced both ways abcul upon ev
ery important public question
which has come up since he lie-
came President, icat witness
isWoodrow Wilson." The news
paper then proceeds to wive sev
eral columns of Mr. Wilson's
varying declarations ant posi
tions, quoting the President him
self to prove his changes of
front, ft then sums tap the mat-1
tor thus. "To as it aeea?sthHtj
President Wilson his i;o fixed j
principles or convections upon i
any subject under tke sun. and;
that he is consistent only in ad- j
voeating anything that promise!
to promote his re election
and j
his personal ambitions."
Nothing more bitter than this j
could be said in the tire of a close i
cfitnpaiga and by an opposing
political parly. Hut this is said
in cold blood at a time when no
political catapaign is being wbr
ed, when it is svttleJ that Mr.!
Wilson is to receive a re noniias
