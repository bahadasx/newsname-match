THE STATE BOARD OF HEALTH
Takes Action In Matter and Di
rects That All the People
Get Busy.
ONE WHOLE WEEK DESIGNATED
Proclamation by the State Board of
Health: ,
Whereas, A careful study of the
official returns under the vital sta
tistics law for 1915 about an aver
age year shows that G5 per cent of
all sickness and 41 per cent of all
deaths occurring In this State In re
cent years are from diseases which
the health authorities and doctors
could have prevented with the in
telligent co-operation of all the peo
ple, a large part of them from what
are known as filth diseases, caused
by an almost criminal Ignorance and
carelessness, even in the best homes
and schools -in unsewered towns and
country districts, in the disposal of
the discharges from the human body,
and lack of dally vigilance in keep
ing the home and school premises,
and especially the back yards and
cellars, absolutely and at all times,
-clean and healthful; and,
Whereas, These preventable dis
eases, causing such an enormous sick
anl death rate, more constantly, as
the statistics show, in the small ci
ties, towns and country districts,
where people ought to be the heallh
'lesiyrlevy"a'"heavidr tax every year,
1n loss of time, medical, drug and
nurses bills, and for premature fu
nerals, than nil the taxes paid into
the municipal, county and State
treasuries for all purposes, can be
prevented, now, therefore,
Be it known, that the State Board
of Health, for the reasons above set
forth, and by vlrtufe of authority!
verted in It by law as guardians of
htfffth and life, hereby names and
sets apart the period beginning on
Monday, May 8, and ending on Sat
urday, May 13 as "Clean-Up Week"
aniliurges every family, teacher and
oth owner or occupier of premises
to gather and burn or remove all
refuse from their premises, especial
ly In the back yards and cellars; to
treat with plenty yf fresh lime nil
damp and specially soiled spot3 and
then grade them up; to whltewish
all fences and outhouses; to look
after the grading and tops of we'Is
and cisterns and see that surface
drainage Is kept out; and, W3n
iuoro Important than any of these
th'ngs, construct "A Kentucky Rep
tic Tank Privy" for every home,
-school or other hulldlng occupied by
"human beings not on a lino of sew
ers. The cement, gravel or broken
rock and sand for such a tank costs
from $10 to $25, depending on tin;
size. It can he "built by any Intelli
gent person, and It is self-cleaning,
odorless, fly-proof and lasts forovor,
-and if It is made the receptacle
for all tlio sputum from consump
tion, and all discharges from typhoid
fever patients and similar diseases,
these atoll soon Interest our people
no more except as a matter o! his
tory. Where, for any renson the
tanks can not bo constructed fit
once, the Board urges that exlsUn,?
gardoi houses be boarded up et the
back and, sides, and lids made for the
seats, so as to make them absolute
ly fly-proof, and guarded against
chickens and other domestic fowis
and animals. If these things aro
done urop.erlv i-nd the purpose of it
is appreciated, itl will be easy to
keep any premises clean the year
around, and if all stables and barns
"be cleaned out once a week and the
manure put pn the fields and gar
den whore it is so badly needed,
the breeding of files will be pre
vented, and one of man's most
ublaJ.tous and dangerous enemies
willvo gotten lid of forever, as has
already been done by many cities
and towns and on a few farms
-where- the plan has heen tried.
Illustrated bulletins with full in
structioiiB for the construction jof
the sanitary tanks, and containers
for samples -of water for analysis
will be sent tree to any one for tho
asking.

PEUPLE URGED
TO V0JEAG1ST
The Proposed $300,000
Bond Issue.
THINK IT WOjlDJE RUINOUS
To the County's Interests and
An Additional Burden To
the Taxpayers.
VERPV STRONG APPEAL IS MADE
To the Voters or Ohio County:
On the 20th day of May, 191C,
the voters of Ohio county will be
called on to vote on the question as
to whether or. not the county should
contract a bonded Indebtedness In
the sum of three hundred thousand
dollars, ($300,000), for the pur
pose of "having good roads." Now
we desire to say that we believe In
having good roads, but not any more
costly roads than we are able to pay
for, and we do not believe that we
should contract a debt that we
wquld.be unable tppay, because the
Inability and failure to pay would
end In destruction to the county.
Now we think that to vote this
great indebtedness is not the right
thing to do, and we want to give a
few of the many reasons for our so
thinking.
Ohio county is a poor county, and
theie is a large amount of hill land
in the county on which taxes have
been and are being paid, that Is
worthless, because the cultivator
and ow'ner of such land gets no
more for what he can grow on sucli
land than what he could get for his
team and labor working by tho.day.
The same Is true of a quantity of
low swamp land that is too wet, and
to burden these farmers with an ad
ditional taxation to pay tills great
bonded indebtedness would be ruin
ous to them. While it Is a fact that
all farmers of the county having bet
ter and more productive land to cul
tivate, are now burdened with more
taxes than they can afford to pay
and ought to pay; the same Is true
of all the other tax-payers of the
county. We think that the peoplo
who got up this proposition to vote
this big bonded Indebtedness are the
capitalists of the county and tite
Ohio county road politicians and offi
cials, and wo aro informed that some
of these road politicians, and road
officials, have said than the voting
of this bond indebtedness on the
county would not cause the tax-payers
of the county to have moro tax
to pay than they are now paying,
but we fall to see how this can be
true, when tho county is now, and
has been for many years, getting
moro In debt and tho county is now
largely In debt and wo can't see
how the county can pay even Its
present largo Indebtedness without
adding more property and poll-tax
on tho tax-payers of the county;much
less, very much less, how the tax
payers of the county can bo made
to think for a moment that thpy
can pay the principal and in
terest on three hundred thousand
dollars C$300,000) , without a
great deal moro tax on the already
largely overburdened taxed people of
Ohio county. Great Scott! the bonds
with Interest might bo moro than a
million dollars and wo can not think
whero we, the peoplo of Ohio coun
ty, are to get the money from to pay
such nn enormous amount of money
with such poor land, on the average,
to grow crops.
We think that if these great
amount of bonds aro Issued, that the
road official politicians vlll get a
great deal of It in commissions, &c.
Think how much money has already
been paid to road ofucia politic
ians with but Httlo results. W.o would
say to the man who expects a road
office, that you may not get tho
"Job" and If you have an olllce now,
you may. not hold it, and wo would
say to the man who may expect a
Job of work on the road, you, too, as
tho road politician, will have opposi
tion and you may not get tho job;
but you will have tho moro tax to
pay al tho same if it carries. Such
a great tax voted on the people of
Oho county; will not only keep peo
plo from coming in the county to
permanently locate, but will cause
people to leave the county and Ohjo
county will bo in a similar, If not
Identical or in worse fix, than was
Muhlenberg county when In the tolls
of the railroad bond Indebtedness.
Farms, will go down nnd Ohio coun
ty will bo ruined. Such a great bur
den of taxes Is discouraging to the
young man, n3 It will cause him to
thlnki that It is useless to try to ac
cumulate property "for a rainy day,"
because he will know It will all bo
taken away from him by taxation.
We think that we already have
taxes so high in the county that tills
has prevented many coal mines froih
being opened and has helped the
tausc of some being closed and some
being, run only a small portion of
time, while It has likewise helped
the cause of other works not being
carried on In the county and to vote
more tax would, In our Judgment,
make Ohio county, a "dead" coun
ty, with a small amount of turn
pike road, which will be worthless
to the great majority of tho people
of the county.
It should be known nnd remem
bered that Ohio county is now un
able to pay the tax that is already
assessed against it and If tiis is
Increased, It will, in our judgment,
eventually cause all tho farms,
town lots and homes of the peoplo
of tho county to be sold to the capi
talist, who will make you pay so
much rent that you will be unable
to make a support for yourself and
family.
We think It Is greatly to the In
terest nnd welfare of the people of
'the county to come out v"ind vdto"
down this erroneous tax, and we
trust that they will do it and save
the county from ruin. It Is claimed
that the Slate will furnish $150,000
of the $300,000. This may or may
not be done, for If we are correctly
informed, the State representatives
have to approve before anything Is
furnls'.od the county. Then only 2
per cent, which Is, as we are Inform
ed, not more than $12,000 any one
year. Signed:

WORM) CHURCH MEETING
AFTER THE WAR PLANNED
Garden City, N. Y.. April 29. A
plan to raise $200,000 with which
to organize a movement to hold a
world conference of churches after
the close of the European war wa3
announced hei'f to-day by Rev.
Frederick Lynch, of New York City,
in an address before tho conference
of tile World Alliance of Churches
for the Promotion of Industrial
Friendship.
A delegation from tho alliance
left to-day for Washington, hoping
to obtain President Wilson's approv
al of the project. It was stated here
that the money desired is virtually
available and it was, reported that
Andrew Carnegie might subscribe a
major portion of the fund.
"I think that we all feel that
the (church shall demand a third
Hague convention to be held soon
after tills war Is over," Dr. Lynch
said In outlining the plans, "but
that we likewise feel that unless the
nations go to that conference with a
new purpose, to Introduce a new
spirit of Jesus in International rela
tionships, the conference will not
taks steps worth while."
Outlining the program of the pro
posed world conference tho Rev. Dr.
Sidney Gullck. or New York City,
