REBELS AT DUBLIN
ARE SURRENDERING
OVER SEVEN HUNDRED PRION.
ERS ARE TAKEN BY ENGLISH
TROOPS.
MANY INCENDIARY FIRES
Damage is Estimated at Ten Millions
--Conditions Are Reported to Be
More Satisfying.
Dublin.-All the leaders of the in
surrection are reported to have sur
rendered unconditionally. It also is re
ported that the Four Courts district
has been re-captured.
London.-An official announcement
concerning the situation in Ireland
says: "Seven hundred and seven pris
oners have been taken, including the
Cguntess Markieviscz."
"The general officer in command re
ports the situation in Dublin much
more satisfactory. Throughout the
country there was still much more to
be lone, which would take time, but
he hoped that the back bone of the re
bellion had been broken.
"Messengers were sent out from the
rebel leaders in Dublin to the rebel
bodies in Galway, Clare, Wexford,
Taouseth and Dublin counties, ordering
them to surrender, and priests and the
Royal Irish Constabulary are doing
their utmost to disseminate this infor
mation.
"As regards the situation in Dub
lin, rebels from the areas of Sack
ville street, the postoffice end the
Four Courts are surrendering freely.
More incendiary fires took place in
Sackville street last night but the fire
brigade is now able to resume work.
"It is further reported that up to
the present 707 prisoners have been
taken. Included among these is the
Countess Markievicz."
GEN. TOWNSEND'S ARMY
OF 10,000 TAKEN BY TURKS.
fit Fated British Campaign In Meso
potamia Ends With Surrender.
London.-Another phase of the ill
fated British campaign in Mesopota
mia has closed with the surrender of
General Townsend and the garrison at
Kut-el-Amara on the Tigris River,
about 130 miles below Bagdad. Some
10,000 men in all laid down their arms
to the Turks, after having destroyed
all their guns and munitions.
The British Mesopotamian cam
paign, waged along the Tigris from the
Persian Gulf northward, almost to the
gates of Bagdad, had as its chief ob
ject the capture of that ancient city.
To divert the Turkish forces from
Gallipoli was another object. When
almost at the point of achieving its
main object late last year. the effort
broke down at Ctestphon, 18 miles
from Bagdad, when the Turks, alarm
ed for the safety of the town of fabled
memory, rushed up reinforcements, in
flicting a defeat upon the British and
compelled their retreat 110 miles down
the Tigris to Kut-el-Amara, where the~
Turks had them securely bottled up.
General Townsend held out for 143
days, his sitpplies steadily growing
lower as he waited the relief of the
army which, first under General Ayl
mer, and then under General Gorringe,
battled its way up the Tigres toward
him. This army encountered strong
positions of the Turks below Kut on
both sides of the river and, although
several of these were carried, it has
not been able to work much closer to
the beleaguered garrison than a score
of miles because of the stubborn Turk
Ish resistance and flood conditions on
the Tigres.
PROSPERITY CONTINUED ITS
INCREASE DURING APRIL.
Washington.-The monthly survey
of business conditions throughout the~
country reported to the Federal Re
serve Board by agents in each reserve
district, shows that prosperity con
tinued to increase during April in vir
tually every section of the United
States especially in eastern manufac
turing centers. A synopsis of the sur
vey by districts follows:
Richmond-Business continues to
show improvement. Farmers are in'
better financial condition than for
some time past.
Atlanta-General conditions are un
changed; outlook for future conditions
favorable. There is a general selling
of the cotton crop.
Boston-Business continues to Im
prove; comparison with a year ago
shows that in many cases the im
provement is exetreme.
New York-The volume of the goods
produced and sold last month was
probably greater than In any March
record.
PERSH ING'S TROOPS W L L
REMAIN IN MEXICO.
El Paso, Tex.-Mexican and Ameri
can ceuferees over the disposition of
the Ameican forces in Mexico mark
ed time while Major Generals Scott
and Funston uwaited wced fro:: Wash
ington as to the next step to be taken.
In the meantime, the following facts
developed: That to date the appar
ent intenton et" the Washington Gov
ernment~ to keep General Pershing's
command in Mexico, has not been

COTTON FUTURES
BILL IS ADOPTED
AFTER SPIRITED DEBATE HOUSE
AS A WHOLE VOTES
101 TO 23.
IDENTICAL WITH FORMER
Two Cents Pound Tax on Future Cot. 1
ton Sold In Exchanges and Other
Similar Institutions.
Washington.-The house, sitting as
a committee of the whole, adopted the
Lever cotton futures bill as an
amendment to the annual agricultural
measure, after a spirited debate. The E
vote was 101 to 23. The Lever bill i
is identical with the former cotton
futures law, which was held uncon
stitutional, by Federal Judge Hough
of New York on the ground that it
was a revenue bill which had improp- t
erly originated in the senate, instead (
of in the house.
Under the provisions of the meas
ure, a tax of two cents a pound would
be levied on all cotton sold for future
delivery in any exchange, board of
trade, or "similar institutions or I
places of business."
Adoption of this measure came af- t
ter the house had passed, by a vote 1
of 184 to 86, a special rule providing <
for consideration of the cotton future, 1
grain-trading, and federal warehouse 4
for agricultural products amendments,
as a rider on the agricultural appro
priation measure. Under the rule, a
little more than five hours' debate on 1
the amendments was permitted.
STORMY DEBATE OVER
NOMINATION OF BRANDEIS.
Committee Members Predict Unfavor
able Report on the Appointment.
Washington.-A stormy debate over
the nomination of Louis D. Brandeis 1
for the 'Supreme Court broke in the
senate, and, before it was over, pre
dictions were made by two members
of the Judiciary Committee-one a I
Democrat-that an unfavorable re
port on the appointment would follow
when the committee reached a vote.
Discussion was precipitated when
Senator Sutherland of Utah, a Repub- l
ican member of the committee, read
to the senate an interview published
quoting Senator Ashurst of Arizona as
charging that Republican members of
the Judiciary Committee were filibus
tering in order to delay a vote on the
Brandeis nomination, until after the
national political conventions.
Senator Ashurst stood steadfastly
by the quoted statement during the
heated argument, which followed, un
til assured by fellow-Democrats on
the committee that there was no such
filibuster. He withdrew the charge,
at the suggestion of Senator Brande
gee, after he had denounced execu
tive sessions and charged that the
Republicans were angered over the
Brandeis nomination because he was
a champion of the masses.
FEDERAL GRAND JURY.
INDICTS EIGHT GERMANS.
New York.-The federal grand Jury
returned an indictment - against the
eight Germans recently arrested on*

acy to place incendiary bombs on

S.Co VETERANS
CLOSE REUNION
TEAGUE REMAINS HEAD; CLARK
AND REED ELECTED BRIGADE
COMMANDERS.
TO MEET NEXT IN CHESTER!
Many Important Matters Discussed.
Spectacular Parade and Annual
Ball End Reunion.
Rock Hill.-At the concluding busi
ness session of the South Carolina
division, United Confederate Veterans.
held in Fredheim's hall Gen. B. H.
Teague of Aiken was re-elected com
mander in chief of the division and it
was decided to hold the next annual
reunion of the division in Chester.
Col. W. A. Clark of Columbia was
elected commander of the First bri
gade of South Carolina veterans, suc
ceeding the late Gen. H. H. Newton,
Gen. C. A. Reed of Anderson was
re-elected commander of the Second
brigade.
Many matters of importance were
discussed at the final business session.
The first question was relative to the
movement to have all veterans in the
state pensioned, regardless of their
physical and financial condition. The
sentiment was in favor of this move.
Another matter which brought on
lengthy discussion was the effort to
put the division on record as to the
desirability of holding the next gen
eral reunion of United Confederate
Veterans in Washington in connection
with the reunion of the Grand Army
of the Republic. It was stated that
this suggestion had been made by a
Washington camp of the G. A. R. and I
that the people of the city would ex
tend the invitation to the veterans at
the reunion, soon to be held in Bir
mingham. Final disposition of the
matter was made by tabling a motion
to send uninstructed representatives
to the Birmingham reunion from the
South Carolina division. Some of the
veterans favored accepting the invita
tion to Washington, if it is extended,
while others opposed holding the gen
eral reunion outside of a state which
belonged to the Confederacy.
A strong resolution endorsing the
movement to have the federal govern
ment refund what is known as the cot-,
ton tax, illegally collected from South- i
ern people following the war, the re
funding being in the nature of pen
sions to the veterans, was adopted and
all camps will urge their congressmen
to favor the measure.
Gen. C. Irvine Walker of Charles
ton introduced a resolution relating to
the proposed publication of a life of
Lieut. Gen. Richard Heron Anderson,
the ranking general of South Carolina
troops in the War Between the Sec
tions. Before reading the resolution
Gen. Walker called to the front of the
stage and presented to the audience
Miss Virginia Saunders of Stateburg,
a great-niece of Gen. Anderson and
sponsor of the South Carolina divis
ion, and her mother, Mrs. Saunders,
who is dame of honor of the division,
and who is a niece of the late Gen.
Anderson. Gen. Walker's resolutionj
was adopted by acclamation.
The reunion closed with the veter
ans' parade, in which the military I
companies of this city and Fort Mill,
the Boy Scouts and numerous bands i
and organizations participated with
the veterans. The parade was one of
Ithe grandest spectacles of the kind
ever witnessed in Rock Hill. It was
fully a mile in length, some 200 vet-.
erans marching the entire distance on-I
foot. Betwen two and three hundred
of the older and feebler vets were
taken in automobiles.
The reunion ball followed at 81
o'clock in the evening, in charge of
the local lodge of Elks, the crowning:
social event of the reunion, attended
by the sponsors and their attendants'1

BUD WORM O 0ORN
IS A SERIOUS PfST
Larva of 12 Spotted Cucumber
Beetle Kills Much Bottom
Lanb Corn.
Clemson College.-The bud worm of
corn, a serious pest to bottomland
corn, in South Carolina is the larva or
grub of our common twelve spotted
cucumber beetle. This beetle or pa
rent may be found at the present time
feeding upon small grain in the fields,
Bruit blooms about the orchard, or on
almost any other green vegetation
found about the farm.
The larva or grub confines its sc
tivity to corn and various grasses
found growing in low moist lands,
commonly known as- bottom lands.
The eggs are laid by the parent beetle
from about the first of March to the
middle of April. Corn planted on low
lands during the egg laying period is
ery often seriously damaged and
sometimes completely destroyed by
this insect. After the corn has reach
ed a height of about ten inches no
serious injury occurs.
Remedial Measures.
Avoid planting bottom lands infested
with bud worms until about two-thirds
5f the grubs have reached the
luiescent period. The planting dates
for various sections of the state has
been carefully marked cut and are fol
owed by many of our farmers. They
ire as follows:
For lower South Carolina plant after
May 5th.
For middle South Carolina, plant
ne week later.
For upper South Carolina or the
Piedmont region, plant two weeks la
:er or about May the 19th.
By carefully observing the planting

SWEET POTATO DISEASES

Clemson College.-As the time ap

hould be kept in mind.
Black rot of sweet potato which Is
~robably the most common of the
weet potato diseases lives over win
er on the potatoes in the form of
mall black or dark colored blotches
rspots on the surface. Where pota
oes affected with this trouble are used
or seed the disease gets into the
prouts that come from these and is
arried directly into the field. Here
he disease attacks the roots and the
otatoes and after causing consider.
1e damage is brought back again

ext fall. Potatoes used for seed
hould be free from this disease.
There are several other diseases of
weet potatoes that can be detected
n the seed and that spread in exactly
he same way that the black rot does.
n picking out potatoes for seed these
hould be looked for and wherever.
ound the sead affected with thiem
hould be discarded or If clean seed
