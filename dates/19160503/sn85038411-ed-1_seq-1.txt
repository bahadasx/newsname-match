Pittsburgh, Pa., May 3.—The Governor's troop arrived on a spe
cial train in East Pittsburgh soon after 10 o'clock this morning and
quickly detrained for duty in the Turtle Creek and Monogahela
valleys where strike riots occurred yesterday. The troop, com
manded by Captain George C. Jack, of Harrisburg, was the first of
the National Guard commands ordered last night by Governor
Brumbaugh to the disturbed district. The men were taken to a new
building of the Westinghouse plant where it is said they will be
quartered during their stay in the strike zone.
The first move toward a settlement of the Westinghouse strike
was made to-day when 800 strikers, in secret meeting, appointed a
committee to confer with Patrick Gilday, chief of the Pennsylvania
Bureau of Mediation and Arbitration, with a view to having him
intervene with the company as mediator. Clifton Reeves, of the
Federal Department of Labor, addressed the meeting, which was so
quietly called it was over before East Pittsburgh knew it had been
called.
The Governor's troop, on guard in East Pittsburgh rode down
into Braddock this afternoon but met with no opposition from the
crowds which filled the streets near the Edgar Thomson mills.
R. B. Rahrn and Joseph Xysecic were arrested by deputies to
day after a search which included houses in Braddock.
Rahrn had been shot in the head and Xysecic in the thigh during
yesterday's riot, and hidden by their friends. All the other wounded
rioters were arrested at noon, and guards placed at their bedsides.
Troop Establishes Quarters
It was almost 1J o'clock this morn-
Ing before there was any display of
life on the streets of East Pittsburgh.
Then the residents began appearing
In the streets expecting to see the ar
rival of the troops but the Governor's
troop had arrived and was in its quar
ters before the strikers were aware
of its presence.
A crowd of boys numbering:
about 100 manned a brick pile near
the machine company's otflce but no
missies were thrown. At the strikers'
headquarters there was no activity,
the strikers being without 3 leader
since the arrests of last night.
Cannot Got Mounts
Troop H. Captain Charles C. Mc-
Govern, was held in its armory here,
and will march to Braddock later in
the day. The Sheridan troop of
Tyyrone. experienced much difficulty
In securing mounts, and was not ex
pected to reach East Pittsburgh be
fore night fall. Meantime the Eigh
teenth infantry had been mobilized
at its armory here, and the Tenth
infantry was assembling at Greens
lurg, fifty miles from the strike sec
tion.
l.arge forces of coal and iron police
were still on guard in the plants of the
I'nited States Steel Corporation in the
Monongahela Valley but experienced
no trouble.

plant 1o walk out. The shops were
immediately closed and it was said

First Time in Fourteen Years
This is the first time in fourteen
years that the Pennsylvania National
Guard has been called out for strike
duty. In 1902 troops were sent into
the anthracite coal regions, but since
that time the State constabulary has
been able to preserve order. The en
tire force has been on duty at
Barre owing to a strike of street car
men for several months and could not
bo called away from that city.
Quiet prevailed throughout the night
in Braddock. Fearing another out
break. citizens sworn in as deputy
sheriffs patrolled the streets, while
...<>re than 300 guards and deputies
armed with riot guns guarded the
Edgar Thomson works of the Carnegie
Steel Company where yesterday's riot
ing occurred.
Other arrests were expected to-day
in connection with the commitments
I issued by Coroner Samuel C. Jamison
jas a result of the riot. Seven labor
I leaders, among whom were Fred Mer-
I rick, a former Socialist newspaper

charge of being an accessory before

Boston Doctor Advises
Special to the Telegraph
Boston, May 3.—"Keep on kissing,

I This is the advice given by Dr.
i Charles E. Page, head of the Health
School in Tremont street, after criti
; cizing the remarks of Dr. Chapin, the
; Providence health official, who, in his
talk before the Harvard Medical
S School, put the ban on all kissing.
! "We're getting germ crazy," said
j Dr. Page. "Now we have put the bug
Into kissing. Do you suppose all this
tommyrot about kissing will be heed

i Ing couples? I've been a physician a
number of years, and I've spent much
i time in rebutting testimony from
physicians which is mere speculation
and does more harm than good, and
I can prove it."

HOW THEY "GOT WORD" i
Strike District Not Without Its
Memories For Some of
the Guardsmen
In the "strike" district of Pitts
burgh's smoky environs the Governor's
Troop, Harrisburg's crack cavalry
command, is on guard.
The story of the sudden, unexpected
call in the night, the answer by fifty
! odd eager troopers in person, the
i quiet, grim activity about the old
J State street armory during the waning
; hours of the night and the earlier
! hours of the morning, the clatter of
! horses' hoofs over the hushed streets,
i more bustle at the Maclay street sid
ing of the Pennsylvania railroad, then
the speeding troop and camp trains,
westward bound—these are little de
! tails that are not without their sig
nificance in these days of the ever
i rolling war clouds on distant horizons.

would be taken over this Spring, we
entered into negotiations for other
