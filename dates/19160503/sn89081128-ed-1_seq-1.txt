VOLUME XXXVII.
COUNTY CLERK AI
GIVEN DEATH BLOW
,' STATE SUPREME COURT HOLDS
EXTENSION VIOLATION OF
CONSTITUTION.
DECISION RENDERED IN TWO
OTHER IMPORTANT CASES
OF INTEREST.
Action of the last legislature in ex
tending the terms of about 35 county
clerks received a knockout blow Friday
when the supreme court held the legis
lative act to be unconstitutional. As
a result elections will have to be held in
the case of each of the clerks involved.
In order to make the election of clerks
of the district court throughout the
state uniform the last legislature passed
a law that there shall be no election in
1916 of successors to clerks who were
elected in 1912 for terms commencing
on the first Monday in January, 1917.
The law provided further that such
clerks should continue in office until the
first Monday in January, 1919, until
their successors had been elected.
This, the court says, constitutes an
extension of the four-year term and is,
therefore, unconstitutional as respects
the office of clerks. There cannot be
any hold-overs, the court says, and an
election must be held this year for those
affected.
Attorney General Smith was asked
Friday by Julius Schmahl, secretary of
state, to rule on the question of whether
the decision covers also the cases of
county officials who are filling vacancies
caused by death, and those who are
holding temporary appointments for
other causes. More than 50 such
officials are involved, the secretary of
state says.
The syllabus reads as follows:
1. By the constitution the office of
clerk of the district court is elective,
the term is for four years, it commences
and terminates on the first Monday in
January, and upon its termination there
is a vacancy and not a right in the in
cumbent to hold over.
2. The term cannot be extended by
the legislature and the statute, Laws
1915, c. 168, which in effect provides
that there shall be no election in 1916 of
successors to clerks who were elected in
1912 for terms commencing on the first
Monday in January, 1913, and terminat
ing on the first Monday in January,
1917, that such clerks shall continue in
office until the first Monday in January,
1919, and that their successors shall be
elected in November, 1918, constitutes
an extension of the four-year term and is
unconstitutional as respects the office of
clerk.
3. Under the constitution providing
that the clerk shall be elected, that hit
term of office shall be four years, thas
the official year shall commence on the
first Monday in January, that all terms
of office shall terminate at that time,
that the general election shall be held
on the first Tuesday after the first Mon
day in November, commencing with the
year 1884, that thereafter elections shall
be biennial, and that the county officers
shall be elected at the general election,
the legislature cannot provide that at the
general election in 1916 successors of the
clerks who were elected in 1912, and
whose terms expire in January, 1917.
shall not be elected, but that they shall
be elected in 1918, and thereby create a
vacancy commencing in January, 1917,
to be filled by appointment and Laws
1915, c. 168, construed as intending to
create such vacancy, is unconstitutional,
TEST FOUR-YEAR TERM LAW
The attack on the four-year term of
county officers, long anticipated, was
begun in the supreme court last Monday,
when Fred Fischer of Wright county
obtained a writ from the court to show
cause why the county auditor of his
county would not accept his filing as a
candidate for the office of county
treasurer.
As the time for filing for county offices
expires on May 30th, it is believed that
the supreme court will render a decision
within a week in order to give prosepc
tive candidates time to announce them
selves should the law be declared un
constitutional.
Every county officer the state with
the exception of some of clerks of court
will watch the outcome of the proceed
ings with interest.
MILFORD FARMER IS INJURED
Gust. Kuehn, who with his brother
Joseph operates a saw mill on the old
Bier farm in Milford township, was pain
fully injured Tuesday morning by com
ing in contact with the circular saw.
t*^V**~ -«*1*9 *•»,,»•* *?«*. I *tf
The two brothers had just started up
the mill for the day's run, when one of
the logs started to slip off the carriage.
Gust tried to hold the log, but was thrown
against the saw sideways and before he
could recover his balance and get out
of harm's way, the carriage had slid
towards the saw and a deep gash was
cut into his left hip. The injured man
as at once rushed to the Loretto hospital
where the wound was treated. While
the injury is very painful no more serious
complications are anticipated, as the
bone was not injured in any way.
Editor B. G. Schulze and Robert
Blank of Nicollet were visitors in the
xcity over Sunday.
NEW ULM ORATOR TAKES FIRST
PLACE IN CONTEST
Considerable enthusiasm was mani
fested by the high school students Mon
day morning when it was announced
that Max Freitag had won first place in
the district declamatory contest held at
Sherburn Friday evening. Alto
gether, five schools took part in the con
test, namely: Wells, Fulda, Lakefield,
Sherburn and New Ulm and each school
was represented by two contestants.
The judges, Supts. J. B. Arp of Jackson,
J. C. Davies of St. James and Attorney
J. E. Haycraft of Fairmont were un
animous in awarding the New Ulm man
first place. Victor Reim, the second
speaker for New Ulm, received fifth
place.
The contest was hdd under the
auspices of Hamhne University which
will hold a state contest at St. Paul on
May 12. In the state contest each
congressional district will be represented
by one speaker and the winner of first
place will receive a gold medal for him
self and a cup for his school. Freitag,
by winning first in the district contest,
will have the honor of representing the
second congressional district.
This brilliant showing of the New
Ulm orators is due as much to the un
tiring efforts of their coach, Principal
P. W. Hutson, as to their own energy
and ability. Mr. Hutson trained the
six boys who contested in the local con
test two weeks ago, and the results at
that time forecast this splendid climax
in the district contest.
The orations were all on the subject
of "Peace," which at this time is quite
appropriate. In spite of the difficulty
of securing acceptable orations, Mr.
Hutson managed to unearth several
which had the necessary possibilities in
securing good expression. Both of the
orators have spent an unusual amount
of labor upon their selections, and de
serve full credit for their work. The
final contest will call for the best that
is in them, but with the evidence of their
ability already shown there is little
question but that they will come up to
all expectations.
Freitag entered high school as a
junior last September, having previously
attended at Max, North Dakota. Since
entering school he has shown much
1 terary ability, being an active worker
the Protean Literary Society. His
friends are confidently expecting him to
place high in the state contest.
HIGH SCHOOL CLASS HONORS
ANNOUNCED
Stoma Kunze won the highest class
honors in this years' graduating class
with an average of over 92 per cent.
Ruth Olson was awarded second place
with an average of over 92 percent but a
a slight fraction of one per cent lower
than Stonia's. These two girls will
deliver the valedictory and salutatory
addresses at the commencement exer
cises in June. The averages this year
are higher than they have been in most
of the past years. The race for class
honors has been so close that it was never
a certainty for the winner up to the
final decision. George Mayer was given
third rank with an average which
came close up to the record set up by
the two honor students.

SHOWS RESULTS OF
PHYSICAL CULTURE
OVER 250 PUPILS TAKE PART
IN ANNUAL GYMNASTIC EX
HIBITION.
JUNIOR SOCIETY CELEBRATES
FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF
FOUNDING.
Why athletics should form an impor
tant part of the child's early training was
ocularly and forcibly demonstrated at
the annual exhibition of the classes of
the New Ulm Tumverein last Saturday
evening and after seeing the results of
physical culture one ceases to wonder
why there are over three hundred people,
ranging in age from 6 to 50 years in New
Ulm, taking advantage of such instruc
tion under Prof. Hein.
While the mass in itself was impres
sive, it was the attention paid to the
small detail which caught the eye of
those interested in physical culture.
Little tots not yet in their teens par
ticipated in exercises tending to build
up their bodies and train the alertness
of the mind. The calisthenics, antago
is and folk dances, participated in by
the little boys and girls, showed tfie form
of physical culture applied to the young
who must have an outlet for their sur
plus energy.
The exercises for the second boys'
and girls' classes demonstrated how grace
in movement and bearing is attained,
as well as strength and quickness through
the exercises on the apparatus. The
third group presented the almost finished
product in the exthetic dances by the
girls and the complicated wand drills
by the boys.
The exercises on the parallel bars went
to show that physical culture is not only
necessary for the youth but becomes a
pleasure to those who have gone through
the various stages of development, and
after reaching their majority feel that
they cannot afford to go without some
form of physical exercise under the watch
ful eye olg the instructor.
While the exhibition is an annual af
fair, last Saturdays' event had another
significance, for the local society of Junior
Turners (Zoeglingsverein) celebrated
the fifthieth anniversary of its organiza
tion. Capt. Steinhauser gave a short
resume of the history of the society and
explained the object and principles of
the North-American Gymnastic Union,
expressing the opinion that the lead
taken by this society will in time be
followed by the introduction of phy
sical culture, not only in the public
schools of the country, but in the church
societies as well. He called attention
to the fact that at the recent Sunday
school convention at Austin the matter
of introducing physical culture as a part
of the Sunday school work, was discussed
seriously by the delegates. He congratu
lated the class in charge of the exhibition
this year and urged them to keep their
minds clean and clear and their bodies
healthy and sound, so that they may be
prepared to face the battles of life when
they are ready to make their way in the
world.
The exhibition closed with the build
ing of human pyramids by the members
of the men's and junior classes and a so
cial dance wound up the evening's enter
tainment.
NEW ULM BOY SEES SERVICE
ON BORDER
Another New Ulm boy is seeing ser
vice through his enlistment in the United
States army. He is Emil Groebner, son of
Jos. A. Groebner of this city, who enlisted
in the Seventh -Infantry about three
years ago and has been stationed in the
Philippines~until recently when the re
giment was ordered home and sent to
the Mexican border on patrol duty.
A part of the Seventh already is at
the front and participating in the chase
after the elusive bandit chief, Villa, but
Groebner is still stationed with a part
of the regiment near El Paso, Texas,
guarding the railroads and bridges and
keeping open the line of communication
between the invading forces and the
supply depots on this side of the line.
The young man recently wrote to his
father that he expects to return to New
Ulm some time next fall, unless the
Mexcian situation takes a more serious
turn. He writes that the outfit he is
with is always ready for an emergency
call from the front and every man is
fully expecting to receive orders to move
at any moment. Through his foreign
service Grobener has seen considerable
of the world and his father is anxious to
see him return home and hear the story
of his experiences.

NEW ULM, BROWN COUNTY, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, MAY 3, 1916.
GENERAL CLEAN-UP
URGED FOR FRIDAY
GOVERNOR IN PROCLAMATION
ASKS CO-OPERATION OF
ALL CITIZENS.
FIRE MARSHALL'S DEPARTMENT
A^.SO GIVING SUBJECT HIS
ATTENTION.
Next Friday, May 5, has been desig
nated by Governor Burnquist by pro
clamation as "Clean-up Day" for the
entire state and he urges that all citizens
co-operate in cleaning up the winter's
accumulation of refuse. This is not to be
proclaimed a holiday by any means,
but a day upon which citizens are urged
to put forth an especial effort to make an
investigation of their yards and alleys
and remove everything which might have
a tendency to start a conflagration or
spread or breed disease.
Robert W. Hargadine, state fire
marshal, has asked the newspapers to
aid in spreading the gospel of cleaning
up and says:
"Reports received from deputies
throughout Minnesota show that there
is special need this year for extra efforts
to eliminate rubbish piles. This is due
to the unusually heavy snow of the past
season. In many places, especially in
the larger towns and cities, the refuse
piles have been allowed to accumulate
close to wooden structures, because of the
inability of most folks to go far from the
house.
"Waste paper, pasteboard boxes, oily
cloths, empty oil cans and other refuse
combine to make a dangerous heap of
rubbish. It is suggested that every
citizen of Minnesota lend a hand and
speftd at least an hour on May 5th to
clean up their premises.
"Work together. Reduce the fire
hazard and make Minnesota fire-proof,
is the only request made by the State
F*|j§f Marshal's Department. The co
operation of the newspapers throughout
Minnesota in this campaign is appreciated
by this Department and the aid is es
pecially asked this year because of the
unusual need of 'team work' on the part
of everybody.
"The Fire Marshal's Department has
sent notices to Mayors and Fire Chiefs
in all the towns in the state urging co
operation on their part. In addition
posters are being distributed for the
benefit of everybody, advising of the
need of what should be done to 'clean
up.'
CAMBRIA BATTLERS ARE HALED
INTO COURT.
The battle staged at Cambria during
the night of April 7, when neck-yokes
and other instruments of destruction
came into play, has resulted in the
participants to the affair being haled into
court at Mankato. The hearing was
held Thursday of last week. Henry
Walters was charged with assault in the
second degree, the complaining witness
being Edward P. Evans. Walters was
held to await the action of the district
court and released on $300 bail.
Evans testified that the trouble arose
over the blocking of the chimney of
Wcodmen hall, where a play was to be
given. This was done during a re
hearsal. He said his son was accused
of being the one who blocked the chim
ney, and that this son and Walters had
some words about it. He said Walters
kicked his son, and that he himself after
wards had words with Walters about
this.
The witness related that it was on the
night of the play itself that Walters com
mitted the assault on him. He said
after the play was over he went to look
for his son and ran across Walters and
some other men in the alley back of the
Tanley home. He said Walters was
threatening to fight somebody in the
alley. He related that he went up to
Walters, grabbed him by the arm, and
with his other hand pushed him back
abouttwenty feet. He said Waiters did
not say anything but ran and got a neck
yoke and attacked him with it. Then
others interfered.
UNIVERSITY FARM SUMMER
TERM OPENS JUNE 12.
Those interested in the development
of country life appreciate the value cf
having for the public schools teachers
who are informed regarding agriculture
ard home-making.
The btst teachers expect to attend
summer school somewhere, and the
summer is the best time of the year to
get training in agriculture and home
min
a
economics. The State Department of
Education maintains summer training
schools at University Farm, St. Paul, at
the School of Agriculture, Morris, and
at the School of Agriculture, Crookston.
Regular certificate subjects as well as
agriculture, manual railing, and home
economics are offered at each.
The summer term will open June 12
and will close July 21. Board and room
can be had at any of the schools at
reasonable prices.
Bulletins have just been issued de
scribing the sessions and will be sent
to those who apply to C. G. Selvig,
Crookston E. C. Higbie, Morris, or A.
V. Strom, University Farm, St. Paul.
OBERAMMERGAUER IN GERMAN
PLAY AT TURNER HALL.
Friends of the Oberammergauer Peas
ant Players will be delighted to hear that
they will spend the summer in New Ulm
and make this city their headquarters,
while they make short trips to the neigh
boring towns for the production of
plays. The first play will be produced
in Turner Hall Sunday evening, May
14, the play selected for the evening
being "Der Amerika Seppl," a three-act
comedy, interspersed with music and
dancing.
The play in its revised form, has never
been produced in the western part of the
country but its production recently in
Chicago made quite a hit, which induced
the company to adopt it as one of their
leaders.
Fetween the acts the famous folk
son£ of the peasants will be sung, zither
solos and quartettes will be given and
last bui not least the "Schuhplattler"
dance which has made the Peasant
Players famou sfrom coast to coast.
Arrangements are being made for the
appearance of the company in several
of the neighboring towns, following their
appearance in this city, but the present
plans are that the players will make this
city their headquarters during the sum
mer months when theaters in the larger
cities are closed up.
Reserved seats will be on sale as usual
at the Pioneer Drug Store.
NON-COMS OPPOSE RESIGNA
TION OF CAPTAIN.
At a special meeting of the non-com
missioned officers of Company A last
Wednesday evening at the Armory, reso
lutions were passed urging the present
commander of the company, Capt.
Babtiste Groebner, not to resign and
agreed to do everything in their power
to prevent such a move, either forced or
voluntary. The resolutions also tend
to correct the rv mor to the effect that the
company as a whole is inefficient and it
is the belief of the non-coms that the
organization is as efficient as any in the
state.
Attention is called to remarks made
by Major Johnson during the recent
federal inspection, to the effect that the
non-commissioned officers of company A
were well versad in their duties and in
this respect were ranking higher than
others inspected up to that time. The
inspection report shows the equipment
of the company to be in first-class con
dition.
The infantry company is at present
making praparations for the annual en
campment at Lake City and the study
of out-jrost duty is being taken up par
ticularly, as it is expected that this
branch of duty will be taken up on an
extensive scale during camp.
Saffert & Guggisberg, the new cement
tile company recently organized have
broken ground on their leased property
on the M. & St. L. right-of-way near
Third North street, for the erection of
a temporary office building. It is ex
pected that the new tile factory will be
in operation by the first of July and
construction of the buildings for that
purpose will be begun in the near future.

NUMBER 17
HIGH SCHOOL PLAY
COMING NEXT WEEK
SENIORS WILL GIVE "ALL THE
COMFORTS OF HOME" ON
THURSDAY, MAY 11.
INTEREST SHOWN IN PLAY FORE
CASTS A WELL-CROWDED
HOUSE.
Thursday, May eleventh, has finally
been set as the date for the appearance
of the Senior Class Play, "All the Com
forts of Home," at the Turner Hall
theatre. From present indications,—
the interest taken in it by the school
population and the advance sale of
tickets,—there will be a record crowd
in attendance that night, and the S. R.
O. signs may be called into service. The
play itself merits the most hearty sup
port. It is of a kind that will appeal to
the greatest number of people, being
modern, full of action, and within the
capabilities of high school actors and
the public always prefers a good comedy
well acted, than attempted assault and
battery on one of Ibsen's problem plays.
The acting has improved steadily
under the able direction of Miss Pierce,
who is coaching the Senior Thespians in
this production, and with the same con
sistent rate of progress, Thursday night
will see a finished piece of work. The
work of Clara Epple "in the role of
Josephine Bender, and Ellen Schoch in
the role of Fifi Oritanski, a dancer from
the Opera Comique, deserves special
credit. Their impersonation of their
respective characters seems to go fairly
beyond conscious acting, and they seem
to live rather than represent their parts-
Leo Berg plays the leading role in the
character of Alfred Hastings, while
Walter Puhlmann takes the part of his
inseparable chum, Tom McDow. The
two form a well-balanced team through,
all the complications resulting from their
inspiration to give "all the comforts of
home" in borrowed apartments.
The action takes place in the drawing:
room of a private house in London. The
time is the pre-ent. The plot starts
when Mr. Egbert Pettibone, a peculiarly
jealous man, decides to flee the premises
when he thinks he has proof of his wife's
alienated affections. In his absence,
Alfred Hastings and Tom McDow form.
a conspiracy by which they expect to
reap the profits from Mr. Pettibone's ill
advised move. The story results from
this conspiracy. Part of it happens the
first morning part the second a little
more a few mornings after and the
climax on another pleasant morning,—
pleasant except for those concerned.
And through every complication and
denoument, Tom McDow "gits half.'*
