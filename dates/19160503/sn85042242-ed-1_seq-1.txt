Developments in Mexican Situa­
tion Are Awaiting Advices
From Oen. Scott.'
SITUATION UNCHANGED
CLAIM OFFICIALS
Gen. Carranza Offers to Put 25,
000 Men in Mexico on With­
drawal of U. S. Troops.
Washington, -May 2.—developments
here in the Mexican situation awaited
tonight's advices from Gen. Scott as
to his further conference with (General
Obregon at El Paso. The war depart
men had received no reports what­
ever from either of the staff up to a
late hour.
Administration officials declared the
situation to be unchanged in any re­
spect, after Preside/ft Wilson and his
cabinet had conferred at its regular
Tuesday meeting.
There was no indications tonight of
any change in a determination of
President Wilson to accept any pro­
posal of the Carranza government
conditioned on the immediate with­
drawal of the American forces in
Mexico.
From Mexican sources it was learn­
ed today that based upon the immed­
iate withdrawal of the American
1 loops, General Carranza has offered
through his two representatives to
place an active army of 2",000 men in
Northern Mexico as soon as the
Americans are withdrawn.
The offer way accompanied by as­
surances, it is said, that more than
half this force would be so placed as
10 guarantee border towns from future
•bandit raids, while the remainder
would be used in a vigorous pursuit
of bandits until the whole territory
adjacent to the border had been ab­
solutely cleared of these outlaws.
Officials still maintained silence to­
day as to the nature of the new in­
structions to 'General Scott.
Can Makfr Concessions,
'•ffflleref is reason to believe that, the
American officers now have authority
make concessions in the way of
limiting the zone in which General
Pershing's forces shall act until a
demonstration has been made, audi
questions as that of using Mexican
railways to supply the American
troops also may be waived, it is un­
derstood, if they embarrass tlie de
facto government in its domestic re­
lations. The American amy officials
are confident of their ability to main­
tain the supply of motor trucks.
Just, what would be required in the
way of demonstration by -Mexicans is
not known. The protection of Villa's
body or positive proof that lie has
ceased to be a factor in the situation
through death or other cause undoubt­
edly would weigh with officials here.
It is understood, however, at the con­
ference a broader ground has been
taken than the mere question of Villa's
elimination, and that the establish
iment of permanent guards against
outlaw raids from any sort is what
is aimed at in discussions with Gen­
eral Obregon.
If the American forces were with­
drawn, the Mexican spokesman ar­
gued, the crushing out of brigandage
would become matter of personal
pride with the Carranza commanders
•whereas it is now a matter of compe­
tition and possibly jeialovisy which
would lea dto clashes.
A proteit against the continued
employment of the interpreter who
has been aiding General Scott and
•General Funston at their conference
•with General Obegon was received at
the embassy today from Consul Gar­
cia, the de facto government's repre­
sentative in El Paso and intepreter
for General Obregon." The nature of
the complaint was not revealed and
Mr. Arredondo is not communicative
to either the state or war depart­
ments. According to the despatch,
Henry H. Ames, an American, who
has long been engaged in business in
Mexico, has been interpreting for the
American officers.

TWO KILLED!
FIJM BUTTLE
Foreigners Attack Edgar Thom­
son Works, But Are Forced
to Retreat.
MORE THAN 400
SHOTS ARE FIRED
Pittsburg, Pa., May 2.—Two men
are known to have been killed, four
probably fatally wounded, and a score
of others seriously burned this after­
noon, when a mob, said by the author­
ities to have been composed primar­
ily of foreigners, attacked the Edgar
Thomson Works of the Carnegie Co.
in Broddock. A pitched battle last­
ing an hour followed, during which
400 shots were fired, but: the rioters
were finally forced to retreat in the
face of a deadly fire from the riot
guns and revolvers of the deputy
sheriffs and plant guards. The situa­
tion is quiet tonight, but 2,000 citi­
zens of the borough have been sworn
in as deputies and are patroling the
streets.
District Attorney It. H. Jackson an­
nounced that' he would .tako.stnm
once for the deportation of all' for­
eigners connected with the trouble.
Climax of Disorder.
The riot was the climax of a day
of disorder in the boroughs of lirod
dock and Ranskin, during which mobs
stormed the plant of four big steel
companies, drove the workmen out,
and then partially wrecked the inter­
ior of the plants.
Many of those injured in the light­
ing at the Edgar Thompson Works
were spirited away by the rioters and
for hours after quiet had been restor­
ed, injured continued to be brought to
hospitals for treatment. Snipers,
hidden in doorways and windows near
the Thirteenth street entrance, tried
to pick off deputies who were fight­
ing to hold back the mob, and two
deputies were said to have been hit.
Women also joined in the mad fight
to .gain entrance to the works and two
were wounded. The two men killed
were foreigners.

Penns Grove, N. J-, May 2.—Mrs. C.
Sinklowitch, 35 years old, was found
lying with her throat cut on a blaz­
ing bed, beside the bodies of her three
children at her home today. Two of
her children, Steuhen. five years old,
and Frank, three, were dead, when
neighbors were attracted by the "dis­
covered tragedy."
Elizabeth, six months old. died
shortly afterward. The mother is

Philadelphia, May 2.—The Oklaho­
ma, the latest oil burning super
dreadnaught. added to the Uniied
States navy, built at an approximate
cost of $7,000,000, was placed in com­
mission at the Philadelphia navy yard

Defense Will Open Their Case
After Formal Motions Are
Heard.
MINIATURE SHIP IS
PLACED ON EXHIBIT
Eieut. Blassburn Testifies That
Bomb Would Completely
Destroy a Ship.
New York, May 2.—The govern­
ment concluded its case here today
against Lieutenant' Robert Fay, Daehe
and Walter S. Scholz, on trial in the
United States district court on the
charge of conspiring to destroy mu­
nition ships of the Entente allies. The
defense will open tomorrow after for­
mal motions are heard by the court
for the dismissal of the case on var­
ious grounds.
Among the chief witnesses for the
government today were William J.
Slymm, chief of the United States
Secret Service, and Captain K. Tun
ney, head of the bomb squad of the
New York police, who arrested Fay
and the others. They testified to the
authenticity of alleged confessions of
the men on trial.
Against the protest of the defense,
the court accepted as evidence, a min­
iature ship with a working model of
Fay's rudder bomb attached.
A demonstration given by Horace
A. Boucher, an expert marine drafts­
man, was designed to show that the
bomb was a perfect invention that
operated with the movements of the
rudder.
The government, considered its case
closed when Lieutenant Robert T.
Blassburn, ordnance officer at Ft.
Wadswoth, testified that Fay's bomb
would have completely destroyed a
ship, he defense contends that the
bomb was intended to blow off the
rudder. They
BP-'-
Conductor Who Shot Wife Acci­
dentally, Operated Upon in
Montana Hospital.
Glendivc, May 2.—That grief and
worry over his troubles so preyed on
the mind of Charles Sylvester, a well
known Northern Pacific conductor,
that his health failed completely.
Sylvester died at the railroad hot*
pital at Glendivc late Monday after­
noon. 'Physicians there had operated
upon him for gall stones or ulcer of
the stomach, and also removed his
appendix.
It was on the evening of February
5, 1915, that Sylvester told his wife
he was going to Dickinson, returned
a few hours later to the rooms over
the newspaper office at Belfleld and
found a couple of men there. A
quarrel followed, and Sylvester took a
revolver from his grip and according
to the testimony brought out at a sub,
sequent trial, started out "to get that
fellow."
His wife interferred and was shot
in the stomach, dying February 9.
Sylvester was formally charged with
murder on February 10 by the Stark
county officials ana was given a pre­
liminary hearing which lasted until
February 17. Held to and tried in
district court the jury returned a ver­
dict substantially that the shooting of
Mrs. Sylveser was an accident.
After a brief time (Sylvester came
to Mandan again and resumed his
work as conductor. His friends
scarcely, knew him for he had lost
flesh and was a changed man. He
sought only to live apart with his
year old son.
The boy presents a pathetic figure
in the case. He was told yesterday
that his father was dead but would
not believe it, nor could any of the
sympathetic friends at the Brink home
where he lives, persuade him of the
truth of the statement. This morning
he went to the Northern Pacific tele­
graph offic in Mandan and asked
whether they had heard from Glen
dive how his father was today.
Charles Sylvester had been em­
ployed by the Northern Pacific since
1902 arid until .1910 ran between Dick­
inson and Glendive. He was trans­
ferred to Mandan and served as pas­
senger conductor' from Ma'ridah' to
Glendive until 1914 when he took up
a homestead 17 miles north of 'Bel
field. He returned to the railroad
work just a short time before the
tragedy which cost his wife's life and
eventually his own.

London, May' 2.—The rocruting
problem in England is to be dealt
with by the British parliament in a
bill to be introduce by the govern­
ment calling for general and immed­
iate compulsory enlistment.
Although since the commencement
of the war, the enlistment had exceed­
ed 5,000,000 men,. Premier Asquith
told the house of commons that the
existing machinery for recruiting was
not sufficient to get more men to the
colors, and that it was the. purpose
of the government, to ask for legisla­
tion which would-compel the so-called
"slackers" to answer their their coun­
try's call.
With the situation in Ireland virtu­
ally normal, the military authorities
are now busily engaged in running
down the few of" the remaining Sinn
Feincrs who have failed to surrender.
Lay Down Arms.
All the main bodies of the rebels
throughout Ireland have laid down
their arms and are giving themselves
up, according to the chief secretary
for Ireland, but until the situation
has been brought under control, there
will be no lessening of the activities
of the military, and martial law will
be maintained.
German Attack.
A German attack atfainjsl the Bel­
gians to the north of Dixniude is the
only infantry engagement reported at.
any point along the western front.
Artillery bombardments, especially
severe, to the nO£l^east of Verditn,
have been tife" soreTnetlfotf'of Vaffafe
on the other sections. North of Dix­
niude the Germans,, after a prepara­
tory artillery bombardment, charged
and occupied three portions of Bel­
gian advance posts, but the battalions
in counter attacks immediately drove
out the invaders.
A German attempt to assume the
offensive against the Russians at Rag
gasem, near Riga, was put down.
German aircraft have bombarded
several Russian positions in the Gulf
of Riga, and a Russian air squadron
has delivered an attack against the
German naval base at Windau, Cour
land.
Heavy Casualties.
Vienna reports that the heavy fight
ing between Austrians and Italians in
the Adamello section of the Aust.ro
Italian line, still continues and that
attacks against Austrian positions
have been put down with heavy casu­
alties.
The Russians are continuing the
pursuit of the Turks in the Diurdckr,
oE Asia Minor.
Steamers Torpedoed.
Four steamers, two of them neutral,
have been sunk, but whether by
mines or torpedoes has not been stat­
ed. A Brazilian and a Swedish ves­
sel were the neutrals. Two of the
boats, the Swedish steamer Friedland
and the British steamer Hendonhall
were bound from Portland, Me., for
Rotterdam with supplies for the
American Commisison for Relief in
Belgium.
Relief Ships Lost.
Two steamers, under charter by the
American Commission for Relief in
Belgium, have met' with mishap at
sea.
The British steamer, Hendonhall,
has been sunk the Swedish steamer,
Friedland, has been damaged and is
being towed into Black beach at the
mouth of the Thames. Both vessels
sailed from Portland, Me., for Rotter­
dam with relief supplies for the Bel­

A dispatch received by wireless this
afternoon from the Dutch steamer.
Batavia the IV. said the Friedland
was sinking. Another wireless from
the Batavia this evening said:
"We are near the Long Sand light­
ship with the Friedland. We will
bring her in'o Blackdeep at' the
mouth of the Thames."
The Friedland has on board 7,000
tons of wheat.

He is now field manager for the
Nonpartisan league of North Dakota.
Through his affiliation with the so­
cialist party, his close connection with
D. C. Coates of Spokane, editor of
the Nonpartisan Leader, anu the hit­
ter's intimacy with Charles Edward
Russell, a socialist writer, 'Martin in
1915 shifted his base to North Dakota.
For nearly live years Martin has, day
and night, preached the necessity for
political action through the medium of
the socialist party. Now he is under­
stood to be equally as insistent on
the Nonpartisan idea as advocated by
the farmers' organization of North Da­
kota.
•Martin first appeared on the horizon
of the state ol' Washington in 1909,
coming from Wisconsin iowa or some
other point in the middle west. He
had barely inhaled a few breaths of
the mountain air of the northwest
when he came to the front as an ad­
vocate of county political reform. iHe
lambasted the "court house ring"
with sucli vigor, posing all the while
as a down trodden and abused farmer,
until his neighbors in the Spokane
valley began to believe what he said.
Other farmers' organizations were in­
terested, a grand jury was demanded
and granted by the court, and the
chief result was the indictment of the
then republican county clerk, Cal At­
kinson, who was alleged to have col­
lected $1,600 interest on trust funds
of ligitants and placed the money in
his pocket. Atkinson protested that
the money did not belong to the coun­
ty, that he was personally liable for
it and paid for his own surety bond
to protect the funds. On these rep­
resentations his attorneys had the in­
dictment quashed in the superior
court and the case dismissed.
In 1910'Martin organized the Good
Government league to fight Atkinson
and the co-called county ring at the
-jW-lUt.- Atjdiwoji .was
democrat, Glen li. Derbyshire, elected
in his stead. Martin went up and
down the county among the farmers,
picturing all forms of abuse at the
court house.
Four years later, after serving two
years, Derbyshire, the reform candi­
date supported by Martin and the
God Government league, was found to
have stolen $10,000 of the trust funds,
for the taking of interest on which his
predecessor was drummed out of of­
fice at the behest. o£ .Martin and .his
reform league. Derbyshire was
traced across the continent located,
brought back, convicted on a plea of
guilty and is now serving time in
the Walla Walla state prison.
In the same county reform cam­
paign of 1910, D. C. Coates and His
paper, the Labor World, furnished
much of Ihc publicity and did the
printing (at card rates) for the-Good
Government league. Coates and his
lieutenants whooped it up among the
unions and Martin furnished the or­

FAIL TO E
Now Rockford Land Boomers Still
Have a Few Days Left for
Final Filing.
The last of the New Rockford cap
itol removal petitions, which were
scheduled to arrive at the office of
the secretary of state yesterday did
not arrive. The capitol movers still
have until next. Monday noon to file
their petitions, but officers of the re­
moval association stated last week
that the last of the petitions woulu
be filed a week in advance of the final
date.
The failure to file the petitions yes­
terday leads to the belief that chough
names have not been secured. The
final decision on that question, how­
ever will likely have to be decided
by the courts. The secretary of state
has no precedent to go by in the mat­
ter. and will have to proceed with

NON PARTISAN FIELD
LEADER HAS VARIED
CAREER IN SPOKANE
PREACHER MARTIN, WELL KNOWN SOCIALIST, HAS BEEN
COATES' CHIEF LIEUTENANT
IN OTHER STATES.
Spokane, Wash., .May 2.—It. 13.
Martin, farmer for less than a year,
one time preacher, office seeker and
socialist lecturer, had a varied ca­
reer during the seven or eight years
he centered his activities in Spokane.
w^v
atory for the farmers, doing effective
team work.
Another of the issues in that cam­
paign was the so-called graft in feed­
ing county prisoners. George E.
Stone, a democrat, was elected on a
platform promising to end the graft.
Stone made no change in the plan of
boarding prisoners, collecting the
same fees as his predecessors and so
continued until toward the end of his
second term when a new board of
county commissioners concluded to
have the county serve the meals.
Stone reluctantly gave the work but
not until more than three years had
elapsed after the reformers had or­
iginally put him in office.
In the 1910 campaign woman suft'
rage was an issue in the state of
Washington. The women looked
around for a speaker to go ainofig the
farmers and finally agreed on R. JET.
Martin. He was guaranteed $200 'a
month and expenses and lost no time
in annexing the suffrage contract to
his work as boss smasher of the court
house ring. Martin hammered away
at both issues night after night, while
the workers in the movement saw
that the silver offering was not over­
looked in the the rear.
For about a year after coming to
Spokane Martin undertook some sort
of farming in the Spokane valley,
about 10 miles east of the city. On
week days he attempted to follow the
plow and on Sundays acted as pastor
of the Opportunity church. Martin
found farming not sufficiently remun­
erative and preaching less so, and
both occupations were shelved as he
emerged as a coifnty reformer.
lEarly in 1911 Martin became active
in the work of the fanners' union
and soon blossomed out as a pro­
moter of co-operative warehouses in
Spokane. The farmers were to ship
their berries, l'ruits and vegetables to
the warehouse, Martin was to sefl
them to retail dealers and the graft
of the commissioii dealer was to be
eliminated. As an initial move the
farmer was asked to subscribe for so
much stock, payable on the install
W^ti^plan,, for- whichr he gave./hj»
note promise to pay. Large quar*
ters were leased, stenographers and
bookkeepers employed and soon the
co-operative warehouse was installed
with Martin as manager at a fat sal­
ary. Its life was brief, however.
After a few months' operation large
losses were incurred, farmers "suffer­
ed heavily through failure to dispose
of their products to advantage and
Martin was deposed as manager. The
warehouse has long since passed into
the realm of memories, being another
of the reforms that (Martin had prom­
ised his followers but failed to ma­
terialize.
While employed as manager of the
warehouse Martin took up the study
of socialism under the tutelage of his
friend Coates and before the year was,
out had connected with the sociaist
pay roll as a lecturer. So successful
was he in picturing the miseries of
the down-trodden and oppressed
laboring man—his friend had shifted

MANY STATE IAPS

Maps Compiled by Department
of Agriculture Are in Great
Demand.
That the latest map of North Da­
kota, compiled by the Department of
Agriculture was issued at a time when
it was most urgently needed, is
proved by the rapidity with which
the 50,000 maps so ordered are being
bought by those who can use this
method of state advertising in their
business.
These maps were received from the
publishers March 27, this year, and at
this writing, April 22, there are less
than 3,000 remaining. By ordering in
'50,000 lots a special price b$s been se­
cured by Commissioner lit. F. iFlint.
which is less than half the rate that
would be charged in lots of 10,000 or
less. This full reduction has been of­
fered to anyone who can use 100 or
more maps, and figures out $1.05 per
hundred or multiple thereof f. o. b.,
Bismarck, N. D.
The map speaks for itself and as a
whole constitutes a veritable store
house of information concerning the
state. No one desirous of keeping
posted on the development and re­
sources of North 'Dakota should be
without a copy. For a little more than
half a cent each, there is no publicity
literature that offers greater value.
Commissioner Flint has placed an­
other order for 50,000 with the pub­
lishers and will be glad to book orders
at the rates quoted above. First come,
first served.
This method of publicity has been
rendered necessary because of the
legislature to provide means for the
free publication of this class of liter­
ature. Money secured from the sale
of the map is turned into the printing
fund of the department.

As the (lays so by, and no reply

Publicly, officials continue to pre­
