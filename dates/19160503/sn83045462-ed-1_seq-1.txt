Gi CAIN SUBMITS
HALF-HOLIDAY DATA
Presents Strong Argument to
President Wilson tor Time
Off Saturdays.
I
Georce I-. <*ain. president of the National
League of Government Emplo\es.
today presented to President
Wilson what is regarded as the most
complete data ever gathered to back
up his argument that Saturday half
holidays should be granted to all federal
employes throughout the year.
Mr. Pain has spent more than six
months in gathering the information,
which was presented to the President I
i
in complete tabular form accompanying j
the arguments.
The President, who takes every Sat-!
urday as a holiday for himself, having |
begun the practice while Governor of j
New Jersey and continued it after com- j
ing to the White House, was greatly j
interested, and promised- to give the!
matter his thoughtful consideration. j
Mr. Cain believes the President is
inBtifla/i in erjintiner Saturday half I
holidays the year round by executive)
order, fortified as he is with the opin- i
.on of former Attorney General McRey- j
nolds. now an associate justice of the j
I'nited States Supreme Court, that the!
t-'xist.inlaw here grants a half holiday
in the District "for all purposes."
Law Quoted in the Brief.
Mr. Cain's brief for the President
imotes this law. portions of the opinion
of Mt McReynolds, and then fol-!
lows with similar laws of a number of!
stares where half holidays are given i
b\ law. The wording of the laws in j
these states is almost identical with
that of the District law. showing that
the intention of Congress in passing!
hie law was to grant half holidays here
all the year.
The data show that nine of the ter.
abinet officers under President Wilson
ome from states where there are
naif holidays the year round, six of
them by law and three by custom. The
facts also show that all the states have
steadily refused to do away with the
Saturday half-holiday law or custom,
and that when the question was submitted
to the voters of Massachusetts
in 1;?14. in a referendum, every county
and every city in the state voted overwhelmingly
to continue the law.
He stated his belief today that if
ihe President and his cabinet officers!
will go into the facts and figures laid ,
before the President the outcome will j
De a most.liberal interpretation of the)
District of Columbia law adopted
March 3. 1^02. and that the President!
may also grant Saturday half-holidays;
from June to October for civil service :
employes outside of as well as in j
Washington.
Wrote to Governors and Mayors.
In gathering hisi information as to
Saturday half-holidays in states and
cities, he wrote to the governors and ofHcials
of every state in the Cniori and
o mayors, chief clerks, statisticians
tnd other officials of the forty-eight ,
arerest cities of the country. He
round that where laws or customs did
not provide for Saturday afternoon
closinsr the labor organizations had
gradually extended the Saturday halfholiday
movement to such a wide extent
that the labor organizations
themselves do not work after 12 o'clock
in a large number of cities.
It is pointed out to the President
that in many branches of the federal
civil service, in the states where Saturday
half holidays are observed by law,
the employes all quit work at noon in
conformity with state laws. This is
especially true in the field service of
the customs and internal revenue
bureaus and branches of other departments.
Officials in Washington have
gradually come to recognize the laws
or customs of the various states and
permit employes under them, outside of
Washington, to work when state and
city institutions, banks and business
houses close for the day. No public
inconvenience lias been caused by this
practice, it is pointed out. as no business
is transacted after banking hours.
U. S. Employes in Illinois Benefit.
Illinois adopted a Saturday half holiday
hour, beginning December 4 of last
year, and Rivers McNeill, the collector
of customs at Chicago, issued notice
that in order to comply with the state
law the customhouse, appraiser's
stores and bonded warehouses would
also close each Saturday at noon. The
nine subtreasuries. located in Boston.
New York. Philadelphia. Baltimore.
New Orleans, Concinnati. St. Routs. Chicago
and San Francisco close a' noon
Satlirdav it U';is Khuu-ri . u ,1,. t,
of internal revenue and many other
departments of the federal government,
including the coast Kuard, public health
service and field services of the various
departments.
The information shows that of
the states offices of the fortyeight
states thirty-four officially
close at noon Saturdays. eighteen
by custom and sixteen by law. .of the
thirty-four, all but three close for the
entire year, one for three months, one
for four months and one for five
months. In a number of these states
the regular workday closes at 1 o'clock
in the afternoon. Officials, writing to
Mr. fain, indicated that the movement
throughout the country is growing
stronger.
Practice Obtains in 47 Cities.
From the information gathered from
forty-eight cities it is shown that
forty-seven close at noon Saturdays,
forty-three for the entire year and
the others for the summer months. The
forty-eight cities are represented in
thirty-three slates and within these
cities live approximately one-fifth of
th?- population of the I'nited States. A
chart was presented showing what has
been accomplished by trade organizations
in 'he Saturday half-holiday
movement. Most of t hose figures are
taken from official bulletins of the department
of l.aboi In Hawaii, I'orto
Km o unci the ]'hjIippines there are laws
closing the government departments
at noon on Saturdays.
Mr. <'a?n gave- the President many
reasons wh\ the- executive departments
she.iil?] be < iosecf the year round, among
therh being c t > That to do so would
conform to the present law in tin- |>jstrM
f and that there is both legal ancl
common sense for the construction that
was placed upon the law by the former

and individual welfare require. i;; > i?e'

physically and mentally; <6> that
the Saturday half holiday movement js
spreading in every state, city and town
and is an irresistible movement.
The league's head maintained that
since the eight-hour workday arid Saturday
half holiday movements started,
i with general improvement in working
'conditions, including sanitation, lighting.
heating, etc. the length of the
work ingman's life lias increased
greatly, with a much-diminished

were offered as amendments to the pending
good roads bill in the Senate today
by Senator Works of California.
Senator Works' amendment relating to
the property along Pennsylvania avenue
proposes the appropriation of $100,000,000.
or as much thereof as may be necessary,

asffo render them detrimental to
health and morals of the people. It is
provided that after the title has been
acquired to this property there shall j
he erected thereon model sanitary |
houses, to he rented to the poor and |
laboring:, classes at moderate rentals.
A third amendment offered by Sena- ;
tor Works provides lor the taking of i
square 28 of the city, or Snow court. :
of Washington because of its insani- !
tary condition, the character and qual- I
itv of its buildings and because condi- ,
tions there are a menace to the health j
and morals of the city. It is provided |
in this amendment also that model !
sanitary dwellings be erected for rental j
to the poor. The amendment provides j
$(>00.noo for the purchase of this square. |
