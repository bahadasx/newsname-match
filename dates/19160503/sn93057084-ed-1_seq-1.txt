DEMONSTRATION FARM NEAR
FOREST CITY
One of the country places
around here worth visiting is the
homes of the three Osborn's, five
miles south of town, on the
Pierre-Forest City Auto Highway.
Every time Ye Editor visits this
''resort'' he is convinced that it is
not the land, but the man, that
makes poor crops. Here is a
GARDEN which we believe the
records show, ha^ never known
such a thing as a drouth. The
trees, shrubbery, fruits, flowers,
vines, evergreens, ctc.,to the writ
er, have always been the same year
in and year out, for the last ten
years. Of course, there "Ms a
reason." That reason has been
mainly INTENSIVE, iustead of
Extensive, Farming. On a small
piece of land, one is able to keep
the weeds down—and nature will
do the rest. With INTENSIVE
farming is included the consery
ation of the rainfall, by the ex
cavation of little ponds and res
ervoirs next to and adjoining the
land in cultivation, which will hold
a portion of the rains, causing it
to go to the roots of the trees and
other plants, at the samo time
creating more moisture in the air.
And then your INTENSIVE
system appropriates thousands of
dollars worth of fertilizers which
are allowed to go to waste under
the Extensive System.
Louis Kehr has tomato plants
about ready to bloom having been
transplanted. The editor of the
paper bap planted his cucumber
crop this early in the season, This
has been done by taking sod and
transferring it to the basement and
planting cucumbers in the sod.
We expect to gain one month in
growing plants as this plan is said
to be successful as the plants can
thus be transferred and transplant*
ed without disturbing the growing
vines. There is no patent on this
process, and anyone wishing early
cucumbers can do the same.—
Pierre Capital Journal.
The local weather prophets are
predicting rain now for seven Sun
days, because it rained on Easter
Sunday in various parts of the
State..
Grover Dagger is moving this week to
the former Schlachter place, which it is

ger's place on the Will Combellick ranch,

east of Promise, where be will become an
up-to-date progressive farmer. He ex
pects to be ready to move about May 10.
Mr Smith's mixed farming will include
uure-bred fowls and a large colony of
honey bees.

DESERVED HONOR
Andrew J. Grant left Monday
for his new home in Lebanon, Mo.
Mr. Grant has been the efficient
engineer and general manager of
the waterworks at Cheyenne
Agency for some five years, be
sides doing a large amount of
plumbing aud sewer work. Among
his most notable achievements was
the wells he sunk from which lo
pump water out of the river, after
a number of others bad tackled
the job and failed.
Another testimonial to his skill
is the fact that, on the eve of his
leparture, the local authorities in
vited him to remain and superin
tend the work of extending the
sewer system, for which the funds
have been provided, and it is his
intention to come back within a
month to accept the position.
He and his wife have made
many friends here who regrets to
see them leave, and will wish them
much success in their new home.
Some Indian boys dont like to
go to school. Last week Mrs.
Spotted Crow's boy was placed in
charge of the Gettysburg stage
driver, to take the train there for
the Pierre school. Hut the boy
showed up when the stage was
ready to start again, got in, and
then when within a mile of Forest
City, took to the woods, and next
Horning was discovered on the
Agency side of the river. It is
said that the boy stole a boat to
get over the river. Saturday
morning he was given in charge
of Long Hock, 0who took him to
the train again. We understand
young Spotted Crow bus a grudge
against the school at Pierre, but
does not object to attending the
Agency school.
The trade in autos seems to be
livening up around town. Arthur
Comeau has bought a Ford Geo.
Comeau has traded his car off to

Otto and Ed Orsborn have an
nounced that they intend to each
get a car soon. Other deals- still
are also in prospect.
