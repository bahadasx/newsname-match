FISKE LETTER MADE
FUBI4C BY TILLMAN
Washington, May 3i!-Rear Admiral
Bradley A Flake's letter to the-senate,
taking issue with Secretary Dinlela for
the latter*a statement that he hever had
been furnished a copy of Admiral
Flake's .letter warning the department
of the unpreparedhess of the navy in
1914, was ma$e public today by Chair
man Tillman of the naval committee.
In submitting the letter Senator Till
man declared Secretary Daniels court
ed Investigation, if one is'demanded.
"The secretary has nothing to con
ceal and courts an Investigation if one
is demanded," said Senator Tillman.
"Neither he nor his friends here like
this kind of sniping guerrilla warfare.
Therefore I content myself that Fiske'a
letter be published in the record so that
all may Judge how.little there is to his
utterances except malice and wounded
vanity. Disappointed ambition, too, has
had much, to do with his conduct. He
has brooded over what be supposed to
be bis wrongs until he seems obsessed
and I really feel sorry,for him."
Senator Lodge, defending Admiral
Flske, said he thought an injustice had
been done the naval officer.
"The secretary of the navy has seen
fit on several occasions." he said, "to
attack Admiral Fiake. The admiral has
engaged in no guerilla warfare but has
a desire which is the right of every
honest man, to protect his own reputa
tion."
In his letter Admiral Flake referred
to Mr. Dan lela' atatement that he had
never been furnished a copy of the ad
miral's letter and expressing great sur
prise to learn thai such a communica
tion had been filed. Admiral Fiske

ASK LEGISLATION TO
BOOST EXPORT TRADE
Federal Trade Commission Would En*
courage Co-operation of Amerioan
Busineaa Men by Removing Doubt as
to Application of Anti-Trust Lsws.
Washington, May 3.—Legislation to
encourage American business men to
capture a portion of the world's export
business, was recommended to con
gress today in a report of the federal
trade commission.
The commission says its investiga
tion into foreign tra.de conditions has
established the fact that doubt as to
the application qf the anti-trust laws
to export trade now prevents concerted
iictlqn -by ,4mertcan btMfne«a men Jn
export trade, even among producers of
non-competing goods..
"In view of this fact," the report
says, ''and of the conviction that co
operation should be encouraged in ex
port trade among competitors as well
as non-competitors, the commission
recommends the enactment of legis
lation to remove this doubt. The com
mission feels lt would fall of its duty
if it did not urge the pressing need of
such action immediately."
The commission expresses the belief
that congress did not intend by the
anti-trust laws to prevent Americans
from co-operating in export trade for
the purpose of competition effectively
with foreigners where such competi
tion does not restrain domestic trade
and where no attempt Is made to hin
der American competitlors from se
curing their due share.
'It is not reasonable," says the re
port, "to suppose that congress meant
to obstruct the development of our
foreign commerce 'by forbidding the
use in export trade of methods of or
ganization which do not operate to the
prejudice of the American public, are
lawful in the countries where the trade
is to be carried on and are necessary
if Americans are to meet competitors
there on equal terms."
The commission finds that other na
tions enjoy marked advantages in for
eign trade from superior facilities and
more effective organization and says
that while the United States has been
absorbed in domestic development
other nations have followed definite
policies for expansion of foreign trade.
