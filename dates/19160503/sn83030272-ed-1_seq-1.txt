The KToup led In Sir John Simon, ex-Attorney-acneial,
and a section of the
Labor members is likely to oppose the
compulsion bill, but otheivvise It Is
thought It will be well received In the
Iloue. Some opposition will be based
on the grounds that compulsion Is at
piestnt a political and i.ot a mllltaty
necessity.
The Government, Mr Asiputli asserted,
Intended to Jeal with the question in one
bill Instead of disposing of It In the
piecemeal fashion which hail already
