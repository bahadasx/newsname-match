Ashley Msrrimon was II years of
age and a young man of exceeding
promise. Ho was an honor student

era of War.
London, April 29.?MaJ. Gen.
Charles Townshend, commander of
the British forces besieged at Kut-el
Amara, Mesopotamia, by Turkish
forces since last December, has Bur
rendered. This information was con?
tained in a British, official statement
issued this afternoon. The British
forces numbered about 10,000 men.
The following official announcement
was made:
. ''After a resistance protracted for
143 days and conducted with a gal?
lantry and fortitude that will be for?
ever memorable, Oen. Townshend has
been compelled by the final exhaustion
of his supplies to surrender.
"Before doing so he destroyed his
guns and munitions.
"The force Under him consists of
2,070 British troops of all ranks and
services snd some 0,000 Indian troops
and their followers."
The eventual surrender of Oen.
Townshend had been expected since
the failure of the forces under Lieut.
Gen. Gorringe and Oen. SCe&ry to
break through the Turkish position
at Sannayat, just below Kut-el-Amara
On the Tigris river, and the unsuccess?
ful attempt to send the blockaded
force provisions by steamers. It had
been touch and go with ths small
British force for many days. ;
The position of Kut-el-Amara,
which is On a peninsula extending into
the Tigris river, mads it Impossible
to send' supplies by air as there was
no landing place for aeroplanes,
?f The forces which attempted to re?
lieve Oen. Townshend met with almost
continual misfortunes. On several oc
1 cations just when it was believed they
ware on ths point of success rising
waters mads further progress impos?
sible.
tion*^
! Turkish communication said that the
position of ths British at Kut-el
Amara was critical, and that they
were expecting to receive small sup?
plies of food by. aeroplane. An offi?
cial statement received Friday from
London showed that a Last effort to
send supplies to the garrison had
failed. It was announced that a ship
laden with supplies had been sent up
the Tigris, but that it had grounded
about four miles east of the city.
Less than a score of miles away, on
the banks of the Tigris below the city,
is a relief army which for months had
been attempting to reach the besieged
forces. A few weeks ago several vic?
tories were announced and hope ran
high in England that the mission
would succeed. Of late, however, the
Turk's resistance has increased, and
aided by floods, they have been able
to hold the British back.
It was early last December that Gen.
Townshend's army, after two battles
at Ctesiphon, 18 miles below Bagdad,
retreated to Kut-el-Amara. Since that
time it has been besieged by a large
army of Turks, cut off from all com?
munication with the outside world,
except by wireless. During the long
siege the British beat off many attacks
by the Turks. They defended them?
selves so successfully In encounters
about the city that the Turks at length
desisted from their efforts to storm
the place and decided *o starve out
the British. From time to time Gen.
Townshend sent reports that all Was
well, but It had been known of late
that the situation was becoming des?
perate.
For some time after the Townshend
expedition started out it was steadily
successful. It pushed up the Tigris
and Euphrates, until in September,
1915, It defeated the Turks decisively
In an encounter at Kut-el-Amara.
Then the Invaders pushed on to within
a few miles of Bagdad, their goal.
They defeated the Turks at Ctesiphon
but later the Turks, reinforced, com?
pelled them to retire hastily to Kut
et-Amara.
The battle at Ctesiphon was one of
the fiercest of the many hard strug?
gles in which the expeditionary force
was engaged. The British were said
to have been outnumbered six to one
by the Ottoman troops. Four times
Gen. Townshend railed his men and
led them in their charges. Hardly
less desperate a venture was the re?
treat to Kutel-Amara which, accom?
plished under extraordinary disadvan?
tages, was hailed In England as a re?
markable achievement. Not only did
Gen. Tow^-hend ward off the pursuing
Turks with comparatively small iesscs,

tries through the agency of an inter

the Southern Carolina association,
temporary organization of which was
effected at a conference here today of
leading men from Beaufort, Coileton,
Hampton and Jasper. Four thousand
dollars was guaranteed by subscrip?
tion to finance the first year's op?

Temporary officers were elcted.

by-laws for .submission to tbe associa?

held In Hampton on a date to be fixed
by the board.
Suggested by the Walterboro Press
and Standard of which W. W. Smoak
is editor, the project given definite

Beaver, Pa., May 1.?One hundred
and eighty of the employees of the
Beaver Valley Traction Company have
gone on a strike.
but he succeeded In taking with him
all his wounded.
A few weeks after it become evi?
dent that the army at Kut-el-Amara
would be unable to fight Its way out,
a relief expedition was dispatched.
As this force drew nearer Kut-el
Amara it was opposed by formidable
bodies of Turks below the Invested
town. Several striking victories for
the relief forces were announced but
their last efforts have been countered
by the Turks so successfully that the
advance has been stopped. The Turks,
taking the offensive, pushed back the
British and inflicted large losses on
them. Throughout the Mesopotamlan
campaign the fighting has been
heavy and the losses severe. On
April 14 It was admitted the Tigris
army up to that time had lost 8,100
men. Since then there have been
several important battles between the
Turks and the relief expedition. In
one engagement alone, at Beltsea, on
tho right bank of the Tigris, a few
miles below Kut-el-Amara, the Brit?
ish lost 4,000, according to an an?
nouncement of the Turkish war office
last week.
The Mesopotamlan campaign ha*
been one of the most difficult the
British army has undertaken during
the war. The torrid climate and lack
of fresh water, together with the dif?
ficulties of transport, made great
calls on tbe endurance of the troops.
Moreover the positions held by the
Turks below Kut-el-Amara, en?
trenched and stronply funified vrro
very formidable.
