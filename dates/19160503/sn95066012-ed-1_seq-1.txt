SI1UATI0N BECOMING ACU1E
Manufacturers Seeking More Employes
Who Can Not at Present Be
Housed.
llennington Is face to face with the
most unusual industrial predicament
she has probably experienced since
the Civil war: Want of workers for ,
her factories and want of. houses in
which they may llvo after they ore se
cured. "
Hitherto the question of more
houses has been mostly discussion end
nothing else, but with the sudden pros
perity which the mills and factories
are enjoying, new plants being erected
and large orders being handled, the
problem of what Bennington is to do
about labor and the housing of labor
is taken from the status of conversa
tion and becomes an acute and vital
need in her immediate industrial
growth.
It needs but a three minute talk
with most any of the employers of
tfennington to realize that any able
bodied man who is able to work, do his
work well, work steadily and deliver
value received for his wages, can get
a permanent job here. There is hard
ly an industry here which is not run
ning to full capacity and many plants
are running night shifts to handle the
unusual amount of business. The
E-Z Waist company is erecting a
building which more than doubles its
capacity, the I'ayno brush factory's
new building has just been completed
and is going full blast, the Holden,
Leonard mill and the Bradford inter
ests have all the business they can
handle ar4 all the Cooper plants are
running njpht and day with the excep
tion of the machine shops.
. The demand for women help . .ex
ceed that for men. Girls working in
Bennington's mills make anywhere
from $8 to $20 a week, according to
the nature or the work and swiftness
of the operator.- The Bottum & Tor
rance Company employs girls almost
exclusively and few reliable appli
cants have been turned away.
Indeed, so acute is the need of help
that at, different times, many of the
employers have talked the situation
over with the Board of Trade officials,
who In turn, in. trying to attract work
' men, are immediately met by the in
quiry: "But you have no houses in
Benninston for your workmen to
live!"
This statement in the main is true
and immediately discounts the effec
tlvcpess of the board's effort to relieve
the labor situation until the more
pressing problem of suflicient houses
is solved.
At the present time It is safe to say
there are almost no desirable tene
ments in the village available for ren
tal. Even this figure may be high

ready added to the attractiveness of
certain sections which have been built
at a figure around $1500 and rent for
around $16. It would seem to the
person who has a knowledge of real
estate rentals that houses in Benning
ton "should bo a good investment, as
houses built for investments go.
Two factors, however, seem to hold
back local men from splurging in
houses, one the fear that Bennington's
present prosperity is more or less
temporary and thnt a reaction will
come; second, the natural New Eng
land conservatism, which would rather
invest in. western mortgages than at
home, : Bopnlngton needs the western
er's, confidence in tomorrow and to be
, wining to back It up with cash.
. Interest ratos in Vermont are far
lower than in the west. This section
is less subject to booms and slumps,
and while Its growth is slower, it Js
almost al ways on a permanent basis.

Crowded House Greets Playlet by
Dorothy Canfield Fisher
STAGE SETTING WAS UNIQUE
Local Talent Scores Marked Success
Under Auspices of Public
Welfare Association.
"In Old Vermont" a charming Ver
mont playlet by Dorothy Canfield Fish
er, of Arlington, was given at Library
hall last evening under the auspices of
the Welfare association and it was far
better even than had beeu anticipated
or promised. I ne nau was crowueu
ml the applause was almost eoiitlnu-
oua.
Mrs. Fisher in her work has cleverly
reproduced the scenes of 1791, the year
that Vermont was admitted to the
union and tho atmosphere was in
structive as well as delightful in every
respect. One or two historical details
were varied a trilU' to strengthen the
Ftory and heighten the dramatic inter
est.
The stage setting and scenery were
perfect. This was built and arranged
by Lawrence Griswold and Irving Hare
who deserve special credit for their
skill and careful following of early
days. The snap and vigor without
waits or delays were due to the train
ing given the artists by Mrs. Arthur C.
Elliott. The music by a stringed or
chestra composed of Robert Long, Geo.
Donnelly, H. M. ititchie and Daniel
Rifenburg, in keeping with the times
was most pleasing.
Where all were so ood it is a bit
unfair to pick out a few for special
mention, but some of the parts were
so cleverly taken as to demand a word
of applause. Mrs. William II. Wills, it
is generally agreed carried off the
first honors, but Phil Endress in the
hardest part proved himself a won
der while Miss Jane Burgess, Law
rence Griswol.d, Mrs. L. II. floss, E. C.
Bennett, E. S. Uuss, Miss Ethel Daven
port and Channing Hare all earned
more credit than can be given them
in a brief article. The singing and
dancing were perfect in every respect
and the song written by Mrs. H. W.
Tirrell deserves a place in Vermont
literature. In makeup Dean Martin
carried off the glory with several
others in the honor class. E. E. Bottum
as Elijah Perry, bore a striking re
semblance to John Garabaldi Sargent,
former nttorney general of Vermont.

BIRDS ARE INDISPENSIBLE
Their Importance Described in
Paper
by Dr. L. H. Ross.
if the birds of the air ,vere exter
minated the earth would no longer be
inhabitable by human beings was one
of the conclusions drawn by Dr. L. 11.
Ross in a paper which he read before
the men's club of St. Peter's church
Monday evening. And the writer not
only made the statement but he cited
statistics and quoted from the obser
vations of scientists to prove his con
clusions. It is only within recent years that
the people of civilized countries have
begun to realize the part played by the
feathered inhabitants of the globe in
the great scheme of nature, a scheme
that has been seriously interferred
with to the detriment of mankind.
In order that tho lesson that the doc
tor has learned through years of obser
vation and study may be taken to
others who do not possess his personal
interest in the subject but whose inter
ests in many instances are far more
deeply involved in the subject of bird
protection, the paper is here repro
duced: "Wild birds are a benefit to
the human race in many ways. If
their economic value alone . were
known to the people generally there
would be an unresisting demand for
their most careful protection and pre
servation. . It' the good that birds do
In destroying noxious weed-seed and
injurious insects and mammals were
left undone the earth would soon be
uninhabitable for man.
While it has been known in a gener
al way from time immemorial that the
birds live upon insects and small
mammals, only in recent years has
there been a systematic and scientific
study of the foods of the various birds.
This study has been so thoroughly
done that now it is possible to tell with
greater accuracy what 10 robins w ill
cat and feed to their young on the first
day of next May than what 10 mothers
will eat and feed to their babies on the
same date.
Birds do not change their diet readi
ly. It is only when starvation stares
them in the face that they will leave
their normal food and partake of ov.her.
If you should scatter on your lawn a
mixture of seeds, grubs and chopped
suet, the sparrows would pick out the
feeds, the robins the grubs, and the
nuthatches the suet, while the warb
lers would pass it all by. If you did
this day alter day there would be no
change in the diet of the different
suedes. No matter how juicy the
grubs were the sparrows would pass
them by and take the seeds every
iwo. If you failed to put out the
seeds the sparrows would soon cease
to come.
Scientists have used two methods to
find out these facts concerning the
food of birds. 1st. By close observa
tion of the birds at their feeding this
Is a rattier tediou3 way and somewhat
uncertain for birds as you know are
shy and will not stand around to be ob
served. Many mistakes were made and
greater reliance lias been placed on
the second method, namely, that of
examining the contents of the birds'
stomachs. This method, as you can
see. Is very accurate, for If the stom
achs of 10 birds of one species contain
the same variety of food, we can be
sine almost to o certainty what food
that species lives upon. These obser
vations must be made throughout the
whole year for some birds change the
character of their diet with the differ
ent seasons. To illustrate this furth
er, I will give the results of such study
in connection with a number of our
common birds.
The Meadow Lark, a bird that fre
quents our meadows, feeds almost
wholly upon insects. Its food is divid
ed as follows: 75 per cent Insects. 10
per cent weed pcd and 15 per cent
grain, " The, grain,.!? almost entirely

vation? how beneficial this niru is to
the farmers. That the bird does some

the following inscription:

Rutland, May 1. A settlement has
been reached between the officials of
the Howe Scale Works and the local
branch of the laborers' union and to
morrow for the first time in a week
the foundry of the big plant will be in
full working order.
The men were granted an increase of
10 cents an hour, making their day's
pay $1.75, and the union will be rec
ognlzed as are the unions in the other
departments at the works. The strike
which has been in effect since Tues
day of last week effected 150 Italian
laborers and their stopping work threw
out 100 or more moulders.
Both the officials of the Scale com
pany and the leaders of the Laborers'
Union agreed tonight that all would
return to work: tomorrow morning as
usual at seven o'clock, the moulders in
eluded.. Tho police and deputy sheriffs'
guard which has been on at the plant
since the trouble started, was removed
tonight. There has been no violence
with a single exception of some alleged
individual moves to influence laborers
not to return to work at the plant.
The laborers demanded recognition
of the union, none but union men to be
employed as laborers; the right of the
union to hire the men; an increase
from $1.65 to $2.00 a day; a straight
nine hour day and time and a half for
