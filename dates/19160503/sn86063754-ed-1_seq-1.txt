ors three times in the last four
years. In 1913 and in 1914 the
Clio team defeated all comers,
but last year Pickens intervened
In yesterday's meet Clio scored
31 points, Greenville was second
with 16 points and Westminister
third with a total of 15 1-2 points.
Wade Stackhouse's total for
the best all round athlete was 13,
made by first place in the pole
vault, and in the running broad
jump, and second place in the
100-yard dash.
W. M. Heustess, also of Clio,
starred in the running events
and made 10 points for his team,
tying with Adrian McManus of
Greenville high for the second
individual honors. Heustess
started the afternoon for Clio by
winning the 100-yard dash in
10 3-5 seconds, and in the 220yard
dash he set a new South
Carolina interscholastic record,
doing the distance in 23 seconds
flat, one-fifth of a second better
than the old figure.
The performers in the various
events were on the whole good.
Three new records were set,
and one old record tied; however,
in two or three events the
records fell considerably short.

How the Mail Order# Are fC
Placed jj,
The advertising manager of h<
one of *he biggest mail-order I pi
nouses in the country, in a talk I m
before members of an adverbs tl
ing club recently gave some in* w
teresting information on how sa
they secured much of their busi- ei
ness. He said: fe
"We have a bureau whose M
duty it is to read each week the y<
country newspapers from all In
over the country. There is not st
a-paper of any consequence in vi
our trade territory that our bu- R
reau does not get. This bureau sc
looks over these papers and ar
when we find a town where the si
merchants are not advertising in rc
the local paper, we immediately al
flood that territory with our lit- m
erature. It always brings re- fo
suits far in excess of the same rc
effort put forth in a territory te
where local merchants use their fr<
local paper.". to

Feed the Young Pig Through
the Mother
Progressive Farmer
The cheapest way to feed the
pigs, up to the time they are 8 to
10 weeks old, is through their
mother. This is an important
period in the life of a pig, and
while he may be pushed along
faster by a little sweet milk and
soaked corn or by corn alone
after he is a month old, still, the
best way to feed him is through
liis mother. This being the case,
it is important that the sow suckling
a littei of pigs be well fed.
It is known by all that a cow
requires grass or green feed to
B[ive the most milk, but many
seem to fail to realize that the
same fact applies to the sow giving
milk. The sow should have
ereen feed, and some legume or
rape will be found best, although
any green feed will be of great
benefit.
It a green legume is being
grazed and there is plenty of it,
corn alone will not be bad feed
for a sow; but the ration will be
improved if some other feed can
be added to the corn. Skimmed
milk or tankage will be excellent,
three pounds of milk to one
Df corn are good proportions If
neither of these is available, then
a mixture ot two parts of corn to
nne part of wheat shorts or bran,
nr eaual narls of mm chr?rtc o?a
A _ m -v. W??v* iO UUU
bran make a good combination,
[f there is no green teed and no
?rain but corn can be had, then
by all means the sow should
bave some legume hay in such
quantity as she will consume.
There is no reason why the sows
should not be fed better except
the neglect to provide the feed.
The feeds which may be pro-,
vided on any Southern farm are
so numerous and so easily grown
that no one should buy highpriced
feeds like wheat shorts,
For instance, unless the feeds
thrown on the farm can be sold
at a price that will make the
selling of these and the buying
sf others a profitable trade.
At any rate, the sow sucklin?
i litter of pigs is, for the service
>he renders, entitled to more and
setter feed than she generally
?ets.
\nother Still Captured in Union
Monroe Journal.
Officers Griffin, Robinson, and
Fowler, made a raid on a couple
:>f stills last night. They found
>ne on the Goose Creek and

Uncle Sam Draws Plans for
Model Cottage at Little Cost
Uncle Sam and Dan Cupid t
announce the invention of a r
"perfect love of a vine-clad cot- ^
tage, economically and scientifi- .
cally made/* that any prospective
builder can obtain by writ- ^
ing to the Department of Agri- t
culture at Washington, D. C.
This model house is so inge- *
niously arranged that it ill ^
save the housekeeper 182,500
steps a year. There are, besides
the wonderful patent kitchen, a j
dining room, living room and s
two bed room, a front porch and
? ~i : ?
a lai^c sitxpiUK purcn. r
The kitchen's principal fea- i
ture is the cooking room, just i
large enough to accommodate a t
stove. When the door of the
room is closed the cabbage may i
boil or the ham may burn up
and no odor will penetrate to
the kitchen proper. The house- t
wife need not stay in the room .
with the stove; in fact she
couldn't stay in if she wanted to.
Windows are so arranged that
there is alwavs a breeze through
the kitchen. The front porch is f
arranged so it will not exclude
any sunlight. The sleeping ,
porch is germ proof and airy.
The china closet has doors in
kitchen and dining room and _
j:.i ? . . - 2
uisnes are laic m at one door j
and taken out of another in the c
next room. ^
The kitchen has a screened ^
porch, and connected with it is f
a fuel room. Fuel is poured in g
from the back yard?it may be
dumped right from a wagon into j
the rooms?and like the trick
china closet, permits being emp
tied from another entrance into 1
the kitchen. ?4
There are seven closets in the ?
house, which is only one story. 1
The nearest approach to a sec 2
ond story is where a window has
been inserted. That window J
gives exit to the smoke and J,
smells from the cooking room, J
with which it and an inside 1
chimney connect. a

The Remorseful Cakes

When he most restless grew. F
He flopped on this side, then on

Then keeled upon his head, d
And covered all at once each spot i<
Of his wee trundle-bed. J
He wrapped one leg around his
waist
And t'other round his ear,
Wh'le mama wondered what on earth

Without the power to scream, f,
