RIOTS OCCUR ;
IN GERMANY
Socialist Leader Arrested and
Many Women Are
Shot Down.
Berlin, May 3, Wireless to Sayvllle.
Dr. Karl Llebknecht, the socialist
leader, was arrested on May 1 In con
nection with a May Day demonstra
tion In Berlin.
Eight other persons were arrested
at the time of the demonstration
which occurred In Pottsdam Square.
As Dr. Llebknecht is a soldier an
Investigation of IiIb conduct by a mili
tary tribunal was ordered. This tri
bunal caused his arrest. Ho wore
civilian clothes when apprehended.
The Overseas News Agency says
that the djsorders in connection with
the May Day demonstration were not
serious" and that the manifestations
were quickly dispersed by the police.
"Many inhabitants of the southern
suburbs of Berlin were called to a
meeting at 8 o'clock in the evonlng in
Potsdam Square to celebrate May
Day" the news agency says. "Some
few curious persons went to the much
frequented square but were easily dis
persed by the police. Nino arrests
were mnde for disorderly conduct."
Unofficial dispatches from English
correspondents in Holland and Switz
erland say the May Day demonstra
tion in Berlin assumed serious pro
portions. One dispatch gives a re
port that 25 persons were killed and
200 wounded. Similar reportB In the
past have been characterized In Ber
lin as false.
Dr. Lleberknecht has aroused much
opposition by his severe criticism in
tho reichstag of the German govern
ment and recently was expelled from
the socialist party in the reichstag.
GERMAN REPLY
IS FINISHED
Attitude Will Be Stated in
Clear, Precise Terms and
Will Leave No Room
For Doubt
Berlin, May 3, wireless to the Asso
ciated Press, via Sayville. The draft
of the German reply to the American
note has been finished
The reply is subject to minor al
terations which may result from In
terchanges of views between Berlin
and general headquarters. The Asso
ciated Press Is permitted to make the
statements, although the censorship
on dispatches tending to reveal the
tenor of the German reply still is ef
fective. The date of delivery of the
answer has not been fixed.
The attitude of Germany will be
stated in clear and precise terms.
The note will leave no room for doubt
concerning the exact position assum
ed by Germany, which will communi
cate the definite nature of instruc
tions that will be given to submarine
commanders and other data on which
Washington itself can judge the situation.
No Advantage for Germany.
Berlin, May 2, 5 p. m via London,
May 3, 4.49 a. m. The idea that Ger
many would dervio any advantage
from a return by England to the prin
ciples of the London declaration is
vlgerously combatted in nn editorial
by Count Earnest von Reventlow,
naval expert of the Tages-Zeltung.
He argues that even then England
could continue, by means of existing
special import monopolies in adjacent
neutral countries to prevent goods
from passing into Germany and also
could continue to seize cargoes destin
ed for trans-shipment through neutral
countries to Germany by remunerating
the owners.

GENERALS AT
BORDER AGREE
Conference Between Generals
Scott and Obregon Sent
to Washington.
OFFICERS ARE SILENT
Americans to Avoid All
Chances of Hostilities With
Mexican Citizens.
El Paso, May 3 The tentative
agreement, said to have been reached
between Major General Hugh,L. Scott,
chief of staff of tho United States
army, and General Alvaro Obregon,
minister of war in the de facto Mexi
can cabinet, was generally understood
today to provide for a gradual retire
ment of1' the American forces in Mexi
co. El Paso, May 3. Advices from Mex
ico City and Washington are await
ed today to set the seal of approval
upon a provisional agreement that is
understood to have been reached at
the Informal conference between Gen.
Alvaro Obregon. minister of war of
the do facto government, and Major
General Hugh L. Scott chief of staff
of the United States army.
The conference was not ended until
after midnight and the two conferees
emerged from the meeting- place in
rare good humor. General Scott went
immediately to his private car and
arranged for the dispatch of a code
message to Washington, giving the de
tails of the understandings that have
been arrived at with General Obre
gon. This detailed report to Washington
is not expected to reach the secretary-of-war
until late today and its con
answer to General Scott until Thurs
day. A similar report Is being sent
First Chief Carranza and because of
the difficulties of Mexican telegraphic
transmission, it is thought that the
reply of the head of the de facto gov
ernment will not reach here until
sometime after Washington has made
its answer.
NGither Gen Scott nor Gen, Obregon
would talk of the deliberations; in
fact, they agreed to maintain strict
silence pending the next step in the
negotiations. It has been suggested
that another formal conference here
may now be regarded as unnecessary
and that Mexico City and Washington
will say the finaj word In the settle
ment of the 'military "questions that,
have arisen out of the drive of the
American troops hi Mexican territory
in the chase for Francisco Villa.
The reported agreement is said to
be based on the general proposition
that the American troops will further
retire toward tho border and operate
against the Vilistas in a restricted dis
trict where their presence and ac
tivities will not provoke further hos
tility of the Mexican people and to
remain there until such time as the
administration at Washington is con
vinced beyond any question that the
de facto government has the situation
in hand and is able to cope with the
Villa bandits Reports that the Amer
ican troops will withdraw In either
thirty or sixty days from Mexican
soil under the agreement were in no
way conflrmable.
As a member of the conference,
General Trevlno said today that It
would not be proper for him to com
ment on the situation. General Sam
uel Santos, who is authorized to speak
for the generals gathered In Juarez,
made the following statement:
"All the chiefs of the constiution
allst army are in full accord and have
porfect confidence In their representa
tives lnthe conference. We are now
awaiting a solution that will be com
patible with the dignity and honor of
the Mexican nation. All of the gen
erals of the de facto government are
in complete harmony and stand unit
ed behind their government."
It also was said that the troops
now In advanco of tho Mexican base
at Namiqulpa would withdraw from
San Antonio to Guerrero and then to
Namiqulpa. This slow, process of
withdrawal, it was thought would
keep the expedition occupied In polic
ing the redlstricted zone on the bor
der. The agreement was further said to
provide that the American troops
would not enter a Mexican town or
come into contact in any way with
the Mexican people in order that
friction between the soldiers and civ
ilians might bo prevented.
On the other hand, General Obre
gon, It was reported, agreed to pursue
the Villlstas with all the soldiers that
could be made available for the pres
ent in order that the districts of Chi
huahua and Durango could be cleared
of the bandits.
Progress Made at Conference.
Washington, May 3. State and war
department officials today awaited a
report from General Scott at El Paso
on his conference with General Obre
gon, war minister for the Mexican de
facto government Unofficial .advices
Indicated ttnat tho -conferees made
distinct progress, owing largely to the
reported conclusion of General Obre
gon that the American government
could not be persuaded to withdraw
immediately Gen, Pershing's expedi
tionary force.
Washington, May 3. Many protests
against Carrauzn's new mining law
were received today at the state de
partment. Representative Slayden of
TexaB and Representatives of Ameri
can mining Interests have urged the
department to protest against the law
on the ground that It Is confiscatory
and permits the do facto government
to buy mining and smelting products
with depreciated currency.
Special agent Rodgers at Mexico
City has been authorized by tho state
department to continue negotiations
to have the mining decree modified.

footing for a few moments in our ad
vanced positions, but they were not
able to maintain their success and
had to retire. They sustained heavy
losses by our fire.
"In the region of Verdun there has
been fairly intense activity on the
part of the opposing artillery forces
In the sectors of Dead Man's hill and

GERMANY MOST
MEET THE ISSUE
President Determined Not to
Delay Settlement by Discus
sion of Side Issues.
Washington. May 3. The announce
ment from Berlin that now and defi
nite Instructions are to be given to
German submarine commanders U the
'first positive indication of how Ger
many will attempt to meet President
Wilson's final demand that sho de
clare and effect an abandonment ot
the present methods of submarine
warfare.
Whether the new instructions will
meet tho terms of tho last American
note and thus prevent a "break in dip
lomatic relations can only be deter
mined by a close and a careful exam
ination. President's Attitude Unchanged.
President Wilson is represented by
those closest about him as unshaken
in his determination that the Issue is
not negotiable; that a settlement can
not be delayed by discussion of side
issues such as the British blockade
and retaliatory measure that tho con
troversy between the countries can
proceed further in diplomacy only if
Germany effectually stops destruc
tion of ships without warning and
takes measures to bring her subma
rine operations otherwise within the
confines of international law.
With a declaration that such orders
have been given and evidence that
they will be carried out In good faith,
tho president Is willing to discuss tho
conduct of submarino warfare but,
only upon that basis.
The news thnt new instructions to
submarino commanders will be an
nounced served to encourage hope of
a favorable outcome of the long dis
pute but nil decision is being reserved
until the newest German note can be
thoroughly considered. 1
HEBER BIN I
IS THE SLAYER I
Taken Into Custody Immedi-
"ately After Tragedy, He Of- M
fers No Motive. M
THREE SHOTS ARE FIRED H
Prisoner Expresses No Regret, M
But Steadfastly Refuses to
Tell Why He Shot.
Br. Charles F. Osgood, one of Og- H
den'B most prominent physicians, was H
shot to death at 5:50 o'clock y ester- H
day afternoon, by Heber Burch, of H
326 Twenty-ninth street. The muVder, H
which occurred in front of the Com- H
mercial National Bank building on ,H
Twenty-fourth street, stirred the com- 'H
munity to its depths. H
DrOsgood had just seated himself H
In his automobile, preparatory to H
leaving for home, when Burch, with- H
out a word of warning, coolly stepped H
up to the west side of tho car and H
fired three shots into the doctor's H
right side, the bullets entering just H
below and a little back of the armpit. H
All three wounds were within a radius M
of three Inches and the bullets pierced H
the lungs and apparently severed ar- M
teries about the heart. H
No Inquest Held. M
Due to the clear cut circumstances H
of the murder, it was decided no in- H
quest would be necessary, and a com- M
plaint charging Heber Burch with H
murder in the first degree was filed M
today by County Attorney "Jos. E. H
Evans. I H
One of the principal witnesses of H
tho shooting was Mrs. Marie R. Peter- M
son of Ruth, Nevada, who is visiting H
in Ogden at 2S64 Madison avenue. Sho H
was standing, with her baby, in front jH
of the Denver and Rio Grande ticket H
office in the Eccles 'building, when H
Burch passed her and she saw him H
stepto the side of Dr. Osgood's auto- H
mobile and fire--three- shots into the H
breast of the physician. As the H
wounded man fell over on his right H
side with a gasp, the Nevada woman 'H
saw Burch turn, step back onto the H
sidewalk, empty his revolver, place it H
in his pocket and calmly walk away. H
Among the other witnesses were R. H
A. Moyes, Ed Danks, John Call, Wil- H
liam H. Hosldns, John Paul and M. jM
D. Migell. H
Arrest of Burch. H
At the time of the murder, me h
streets wore crowded with people and H
tho numerous witnesses were so dazed H
at Its suddenness that Burch had H
plenty of time to calmly empty the H
two remaining bullets from the re- H
volver, slip the gun Into his pocket H
and walk west to merchants alley be- H
fore he was stopped by Officer Paine. H
Robert A. Moyes, a witness of the H
shooting, notified tho police. Chauf- H
feur Gold Wheat receiving the mes- H
sago and quickly Informing Chief of H
Police Thomas E. Browning and Pa- H
trolman William Richardson. The jm
three boarded the auto-patrol and JM
reached the scene a few seconds after H
the murderer had been taken into iH
Burch when asked for his gun, took H
it out of his pocket, broke it to Bhow H
that It was empty and then handed it jm
to Officer Paine. He was then placed ,H
, in the auto-patrol and taken to the jH
police station. ' lM
In the meantime, the main body of l
f the crowd had rushed to the automo- jH
bile in which Dr. Osgood was gasping.
Patrolmen Canfield and Fitzgerald, H
who were nearing Twenty-fourth H
street on Washington avenue, when H
the shooting occurred, were among jH
the first to reach the car and. lifting H
the wounded physician from his doub- H
led-up position behind the steering jH
wheel, carried him into the office iH
of tho Utah Power and Light com- H
pany. Tho office was Immediately H
closed by Manager P. M. Parry, to H
keep the crowd out, and Dr. W. E. H
Whalen was summoned. Dr. Osgood, H
in the judgment of the city physician tH
was dead when taken into the light IjH
company's offico. M
A Sad Scene. M
Dr. Franklin C. Osgood, a brother H
of the slain man, was one of the first 'H
to reach the scene. As ho entered the I M
office of tho electric company and H
his eyes caught the prostrated form, H
he exclaimed: H
"Oh, my God, ray brother!" H
Then he turned to go and starting H
back, throwing himself on the floor H
where the body rested and enfolding iH
the dead, wept. llH
Body is Cared For. IH
The dentist, though almost prostmt- ;H
ed, took charge of the situation with jH
members of tho Masonic lodge and M
had thexbody taken to the Kirkendall H
mortuary. H
When the ambulance arrived, a H
great crowd had gathered in front of M
the olectrio company's office, and an H
the auto proceeded to move through JH
merchant's alley to reach the rear of H
the building, there was a sudden rush H
in that direction and officers had td H
