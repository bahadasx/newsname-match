MEMBERS OF CITY COUNCIL AND
MAYOR RICHARDSON
CLASH.
CITY MANAGER PLAN TO BE TRIED
Mayor Richardson Will Veto Measure
Passed at Special Meeting
Tuesday Night.
A merry row developed at a special
meeting of the city cpuncil held for
that purpose last Tuesday evening.
The participants included tl:e mayor,
r-embers of the council, city clerk
and city attorney.
The clash came over the proposed
adoption of an, ordinance creating
the office of City Manager with a
salary cn cne hundred and twenty
dollars a month. The object of the
move Was to oust clerk Wilson frcm
office. Tiie council and Mr. Wilson
have been at loggersbead for seme
time over the question of salary.
For his services as city clerk and
superintendent of the water wcrks
Mr Wilson receives seventy dollars
a month and as city engineer fifteen
dollars a month. A few weeks ago
he asked for a raise in his sa'ary as
city engineer from fifteen to thirty
dollars a month. This the council
refused to grant whereupon Mr. Wil
son resigned from the position of
city engineer. The council found that
they could not hire anyone to take
the engineer's job alono at the Bal
Bry and as all of the city positions
Just about make one good job, they
pought to have the same man fill all
positions. In order to relieve Mr.
Wilson from the positions from w! ic1
he had not resigned an ordinance
•was passed creating! the office of
City Manager who would perform all
the duties of clerk, superintendent
of water works, city engineer and
Street commissioner. The mayor
took time to consider whether or not
hs would approve the ordinance. He
ha® two weeks to consider his action.
Mayor Richardscn and councilman
Williams opposed the passage of the
ordinance while the other members
favored it. The scenes that were
witnessed and the language used at
last night's council meeting are much
to "be deplored.

PL INS LINES OVER DELAWARE COUNTY
Manchester to Be Center for Sup

Towns and Country.
A deal was closed last Saturday for
the sale of the Manchester Light,
Heat & Power company to the Dows
Smitli-Reed syndicate of Cedar Rap
ids, a group of capitalist operating
a string of electric light plants in Io
wa, numbering in the neighborhood cf
one hundred. The formal transfer of
the property which will be made in
near future will bring into Manches
ter Qne of the largest concerns cf its
kind operating in the country. Its
lines extend over Jones and Linn
counties on the south, and will new
be extended to other towns in Dela
ware county.
It is the plan to make Mane-ester
the central point for supplying cur
rent to nearby towns in this and ad
joining counties cn the west and
north. By this purchase the com
pany comes into possession of a
good busines-s and a well equipped
plant. Largely through the
of Lafe Matthews Sr., who owned all
of the stock of the local plant, it was
built up and operated on a profitab'?
basis. Under his ownership the com
pany has given the public excellent
service and well merited the gener
ous patronage it enjoyed.
We arc informed that no change
is contemplated in the working
forc« of the plant.
The new owners say they aim to
give the people cf Manchester the
best of service at a minimum cost.

Summing up, therefore, we call
I your attention to the following poinfs
1. Until your schools are improved
in th? particulars set out above, your
children throughout tho schools are
not receiving benefits provided in
other schools of like size,
2. Unless ycur schools are improv
ed in the above mentioned particulars
they ars not fairly meeting the re
quirements of approval for high
school tuition purposes. Unless a
school is approved by the Department
of Public Inspecticn, it is illegal to
collect tuition fcr non-resident pupils
in the district in which they reside,
With your seventy high schorl tui
'tion pupils this involves about $3,500
annually, to say nothing of the lecal
prestige.
3. When a school has been desig
nafed as a normal training1 high
school to receive $750.00 aid annually,
it is presupposed that the conditions
in the school in all particulars and
the spirit and support of the com-
!munity

shall, if anything, be above
rather than below average school
conditions. We are confident that
'once these matters are given full
consideration that the response frcm
the community will be all that is de
sired, but until the conditions herein
stated can be adequately taken care
of, the Department of Public Instruc
tion cannot feel justified in crntin
