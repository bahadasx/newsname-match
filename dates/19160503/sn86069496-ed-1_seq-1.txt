Waiting.
Death of Rollin Keilner.
C F. Mom.4;imrY Candidate,
Hon. Chas. F Montgomery, of Casey
county U a Democratic candidate for
Congress to succeed Mr. Helm, from
the Eighth district. He is somewhat
identified wiih Adair county, his
father and mother having both been
born and reared near Columbia, and
naturally, he has a very tender feeling
for Adair, and our people hold him in
the highest esteem He has served
four years as State Senator from the
Casey-Lincoln district, and was one of
the most earnest workers in the Uc
per branch of the Kentucky Legisla
ture. He is a Democrat in whom
there is no puMe, a lawyer of ability
and a forceful and ready debator. His
formal announcement appears 'in The
News to day. The Stanford Journal
gives Mr. Montgomery the following
write up:
Hon. Charles F. Montgomery, of
Liberty, Case) county, is a candidate
for the Democratic nomination for
Congress, in this, the Eighth district
of Kentucky, subject to the primary
to be held the first Saturday in Au
gust. In making this announcement,
Senator Montgomery is responding to
the solicitation of prominent Dem
ocrats all over the district that he
stand for the nomination, as well as a
laudable ambition to represent the 11
counties of this splendid district of
Kentucky in the halls of congress.
His friends say he has been assured of
the support of a splendid majority in
every county of the district, and that
he starts withlhe enthusiastic support
of a majority of the men who have
won Democratic victories in the coun
ties of the district in recent years.
Senator Montgomery is already well
kmown over the counties of the Eighth
district. He has se'rved four years as
"State Senator from the counties of
Casey, Boyle, Lincoln and Garrard,
and those who have examined his
record with a critical eye say that it is
without a flaw, in that he has always
been found voting for fundamental
Democratic doctrines, and always with
the best interests of the" people and
the wishes of his constituents cbn
stantly in mind.
Senator Montgomery is one of the
younger Democratic leaders of the
State with whom rests the future of
that party. Born in Lincoln county,
the son of a beloved Christian minis-
J ter, Rev, J. Q. Montgomery, hemoved
with his father to Casey county when
a child, where he has since made his
, home. After graduating from Tran
sylvania University and studying law
at Washington and Lee University, he
entered upon the practice of Law at
Liberty, and has made a signal success
in, his profession. He is a splendid
speaker, convincing and keen in orato-.
ry, and he will be heard and judged
from the stump all over the district in
this campaign. Up until a few years
.ago Casey county, his home, was in
the "bloody" Eleventh district, hope
lessly Republican, and the mettle of
which Democratic workers had to be
made in combatting the Republican
hordes had to bestaunch Indeed Sev
eral times under the leadership of Sen
atwXaatgomery: the Democratic ban
ner was carried to victory over the
normal Republican majo'nty of 500 in
Casey. He was himself elected Coun
ty Attorney, and later led the ticket
to victory in the county judgeship and
County Attorney races at the time he
. was the party's nominee three years
ago. He knows what it is to fight for
whatDemocrats want and his friends
say he will make just that sort of cam
paign for the nomination, and if nom
inated, will carry the Eighth district
over the common enemy by an old
time majority, in November. .
Senator Montgomery has been a
staunch supporter of President Wood
row Wilson at all times, is 'fortunate
in never having been embroiled in
factional fights which have often
hurt the party, and is in every way re--nrkably
well qualified to carry his
Ry's banner to victory and then to
most ably represent his people in
coBgreseional halls.

Last Wednesday morning Mr. Ernest
Young Garvin, son of Mr. and Mrs.
William Garvin, this place, was mar
ried, in the suburbs of Campbells ville,
to Miss Bessie Virginia Rhodes, of
that city. The ceremony was pro.
nounced by Rev. L. C. Kelley, while
the couple were seated in an auto.
The groom, is an industrious young
man who is in the employee- Of W. R.
Myers & Son. His determination to
never say nay won his bride, who is a
popular and deserving jcung woman.
Her foster mother, for weeks, refused
her consent to the marriage, but Pete
sawed wood, saying but little, but got
in a communication to the young lady
every few days She never wavered
in her plighted love, and the old lady
seeing that it was no use to stand out ;
against the determination of the young
couple, consented to the union, and
the ceremony was said.
The groom has many friends in Co
lumbia, and they extend to him and
his bride, their best wishes; There is
no doubt but there is a good living for
them, and there is no doubt but Pete's
industrious habits will make it.
" The couple visited the groom's par
ents here Jast Thursday afternoon and
evening, but their home will be Camp
bellsville. A boy who has sticktoit
iveness will succeed and that is the
reason we admire young Garvin's
course.

Rollin J. Keltner, son of Uriah and
Alta Keltner, of Adair county, depart
ed this life April the 23rd, 1916, aged
21 years. This sad event brought deep
sorrow to a wide circle of friends, and
was a crushing shock to his devoted
father, brother and sister, his mother
having preceded him to the grave
some thirteen years ago
Nearly two years ago he entered the
Lindsej -Wilson Training School at Co
lumbia, in order, to get an education
to aid him in preaching the Gospel, a3
he felt that he was called to preach,
and there was no doubt in the minds
of all who knew him, and heard his
conversation, that God had surely laid
His hand on him. For some reason he
gave up school, came home, but never
failed to cling to the Bible and hold on
to God. He took great interest in all
kinds of religious services was a good
worker and great help in revival meet
ings, and enjoyed himself many times
shouting and praising God for the
love he had in his heart.
Some tlve weeks ago, for some un
known reason, he secretly joined trie
army at Springfield, 111 , and went
from there to Jefferson Barracks, Mo.,
where he took the measles, and that
terminated in acute bronchal pneumo
nia, and resulted in death.
It is indeed painful and grievous to
us to think that poor Rollin passed
away without father, brother or sister
uear to say good bye. But we know
that God in His wisdom knows best
and doeth all things well, so we have
no doubt that Rollin to-day is in heav
en shouting and praising God as he
did here on earth.
His funeral was preached by Rev.
Joe Furkin and W. C. Christie, a
large congregation of relatives and
friends being present, to await the
arrival of his body, which was neatly
attired in a soldiers uniform of brown,
placed in a beautiful coffin. After the
services his remains were laid to rest
in the buaying ground to await the
resurrection mcrning.
The golden gates were open,
A gentle voice said come!
And with farewells unspoken
Rollin safely entered home."
His step Mother.
