No Longer Game of Chance,
But a Science, Says
A. W. Douglas.
TRUTH AN ESSENTIAL
Publicity Work Discussed by
Courtland Smith, C. F.
Hatfield and L. Harris.
'Iluit advertising, in order to lie cf
fictive. must lie honest was the loud
est and most persistent string in the
sjmphonj of advertising which held
forth in Switzler Hall toda. That it
was a science and not a game of
chance and that it must be original
anil convincing had many solo parts
That it jiaid, paid handsomely, was a
small but effective minor.
A W Douglas, v ice-president of the
Simmons Hardware Company, St.
I-ouK said in part:
"Advertising is in its formative pe
riod It is a tremendously big and
joung and interesting science, and its
rules have not all been laid down jet.
However, it is no longer a game of
dunce where jou shut jour ejes, fire
into the dark and trust to the god of
chance that the right mark will be
hit.
"In a waj it is a simple science,
and has onlj two requirements for the
one who would succeed by its magic.
Thej are, first, a knowledge of hu
man nature, and second, a knowledge
of the English language.
Ads Too Cmiveitlitmnl.
"It is marvelous how little most of
us know about human nature Soph
ocles said that the principal thing
th.it struck him about people in busi
ness was that thej knew nothing
about business. I sometimes think
the same thing about people in ad
vertising Read the advertisements
in anj magazine, note how con
strained, how conventional There
isn't one out of five of them that
shows the slightest trace of imagina
tion or idealism Imagination and
idealism are most potent factors, most
invaluable assets in the business of
advertising.
"If I were going to advertise a razor
I wouldn't start out by telling how
the razor was tempered or sharpened,
or launch forth in a maze of techni
calities, but I'd saj- that my razor
was the original blade used by the
Scribes and Pharisees to split hairs
with and that no red-haired, cross
ejeil woman had anj thing on it when
it came to temper.
"Advertising must be a continuous
performance it should not be an in
terlude "It must bo true It must be worth
while"
Profil in Foreign Vdtertising.
Courtland Smith, president and
general manager of the American
I'ress Association, Xew York Citj,
speaking on "C'ountrj Newspapers
and National Advertising," said that
foreign advertising offered the larg
est field of profit to the country pub
lisher. "I'p to the last six jears countrj"
newspapers have never given much
attention to this form of advertising,"
said Mr. Smith. "Thej have allowed
the magazines and the citj papers to
get it awaj from them, though it is
theirs bj everj right, because only
the newspaper man in the small
commuuitj can give to his advertisers
the personal interest touch which he
desires above all other things.
"Fiftj ears ago, when advertising
began to be a science, the vv eekly pub
Mentions took it up; twentj-five jears
later the magazines got into the field;
then the metropolitan papers organ
ized to take it away from the maga
zines; todav we have the advertiser
himself forcing the countrj newspa
pers to take it from him.
"The first move for the small pa
per publisher is to print a rate card.
The psjchological effect of seeing his
own prices in cold tjpe is tremen
dous, if he has weak knees or a lim
ber spine I know of no better stiffen
er than a printed rate card.
"No space, no matter how small the
circulation, can be sold at a profit,
for less than 10 cents net to the pub
lisher "The second vital point is that the
publisher must tell the truth about
his circulation.
"The third, and perhaps the biggest.
Is that he must co-operate with his
advertiser This is the point of his
greatest vantage. The national maga
zine and the metropolitan paper are
here left out in the cold. Only the
small town publisher can come in di
rect personal contact with his read
ers, can act as a living link between
manufacturer and consumer."
Don't Forget to Collect.
Having secured his advertising and
published it. Mr. Smith urged, the ad
vertisers not to forget to collect for
it. One advertising agency in Phila
delphia, he declared, j early stole 30,-
000 from publishers who were too
careless to collect for advertising
which they had published and which
the manufacturer had paid for.
".My own firm," said Mr. Smith,
"has today in its treasury $8,000
which we cannot force upon the pub
lishers who have earned it. For some
of it we have sent out as many as
three cheeks, and they have never
been cashed. I do not know how we
will get rid of it it isn't ours and
we don't want it. Do not be too proud
and haughtj, or too careless, to cash
a $1 check."
On Coinniiiiiil) Advertising.
Charles l Hatfield, secretarj and
general manager of the St. Louis Con
vention and Publicity Bureau, follow
ed with a paper on -Community Advertising."
The foundation of community ad
vertising," he said, "Is having some
thing worth while to show. The
mere mentioning of special municipal
features indicates possibilities which
could be expanded innumerablj-. A
city telling what it has, secures for
itself a tremendous volume of adver
tising of the most forcefu' kind ad
vertising that works for manj jears"
Fine literature, prepared in a sjs
tematic and attractive stjle, telling
about the city and all its features, was
suggested by the speaker as an im
portant method of bringing the citj to
the attention of the outside world. A
good band or sjmphony orchestra was
also suggested, the latter suggestion
having been put to the practical test
in St. Louis. Fairs, expositions and
conventions were mentioned as espe
cially fine methods of advertising a
community.
"Columbia is giving, this week, one
of the best illustrations of commuui
tj advertising," said the speaker. "Its
seventh Journalism Week focuses the
attention of many thousands of peo
ple cm this citj. There are manj
c ther c onv i ntions that can b1- draw n to
Columbia because of the pulling
power of its educational atmosphere"
Writing- fur the Railroads.
"Hailroad Publicitj" was discussed
by Lucien Harris, editor of the Fris
co Magazine, St. Louis.
"The era of the railroad writer is
at hand," said Mr. Harris. "Writing
for the railroads is one of the great
eat fields for the near future, and
the coming journalists should take no
tice of this fact.
"Twenty jears ago the railroad of
ficial took a verj unfriendly stand rel
ative to the newspaper man; todaj
he cannot saj too many nice things
about the country press."
