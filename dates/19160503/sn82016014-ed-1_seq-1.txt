Dr. Walker admitted ' that he had
been called into cases, the same as all
other physicians with extended prac
tices, where there was evidence of an
operation. Yet. he did not feel that
he was pro perl 5 protecting the pa
tient by reporting the same to auth
orities and f-iere is no law, the doctor
says, which compels a physician to re
port such cases. It would ruin the pa
tient, he declared.
"In nine cases out of ten the patient
wouldn't give out the name of the doc
tor anyway," said Dr. Walker. T am
like every member of the society anx
ious to do anything in the world to rid
the profession of such men but we
are hardly protecting our patients
properly by reporting their condition
to the authorities."

Mexican War Minister Fears
Desertion by Troops.
BY K. T. CONKLF.
El Paso, May 3. The American ex
pedition will remain in Mexico with
out interference from Carranzista
troops, accotding to an agreement
reached early today by Chief of Staff
Scott and Carranza War Minister
Obregon, after a conference lasting
nearly twelve hours.
Obregon has granted permission for
the expedition to have full use of the
Mexican Northwestern railroad in
transporting supplies and men ar.d has
promised to co-operate "as fully as
possible" with Cleneral Pershing's
forces, it was stated on reliable au
thority. In return, Scott was unoffi
cially reported to have set a sixty-day
limit on the presence of the Ameri
cans in Chihuahua. Scott's conces
sions, if any were made, were not def
initely known, however, and it was
believed the war department would
give out the program agreed upon in
a short lime.
I'lan Awaits Ratification.
The conclusion will not become ef
fective, according to the understand
ing around the conference room, until
ratified by the respective govern
ments. Thcugh Obregon was clothed
with greater authority than Scott, he
will submit his report to General Car
ranza while Scott s part of the agree
ment will be subject to ratification by
the Washington administration.
Hampered heretofore by the neces
sity of maintaining strong communi
cation lines almof-t paralleling a rail
road, General Pershing has not had
the free rein he desired. Use of the
Northwestern line granted by Obre
gon means some of the guard troops
can be utilized for chasing Villa ban
dits. The only thing remaining to ful
fill the agreement is Carraaaa's O. K.
This, officials think, will be given, .
Field ltax at Colonia Dnhlan.
The agreement to establish the
American base at Colonia Dublan
means that the present Casas Grandes
base will be moved northward about
ou miles.
In effect, the agreement is what
Scott's original orders sought. Amer
icans will patrol northern Mexico
scattering Villa's men. while Car
ranza's soldiers can chase him to the
southward, if they will.
A short, quick clean-up of the
campaign is in prospect. If General
Funston feels the scourge of border
rebels has been eliminated, the troops
can be withdrawn, or, if the Carran
zistas devote their strength.it maybe
accomplished before the American ex
pedition has done this.
The way is now clear for state de
partment "treating" on the subject
with withdrawal unless General Car
ranza unexpectedly rejects what Scott
and Obregon accomplished.
Await Marching- Orders.
Columbus, N". M.. May 3. The ab
sence of marching orders for the large
bodies of troops now at trTis base,
which has been preparing for 24 hours
to go forward at a moment's notice, is
believed here to be due to develop
ments in tne ftcott-Ubregon confer
ence. Throughout the day and last night
troops and a machine gun company
were under orders to be ready to move
at once.
General Pershing is reported to have
transferred his field headquarters to
Ran Antonio, Mexico. Speculation
has been aroused here over the rea
son for the change, but it is believed
to be only temporary.
The 135 motor trucks which were
reported stalled in the mud near As
cencion and Dublan. Mexico, are ar
riving here and are being hurried back
heavily laden with reserve rations for
troops at the front.
Assure Harmony.
General Samuel Santos, who is auth
orized to speak for the generals gath
ered in Juarez, made the following
statement:
"All the chiefs of the constitution
alist army are in ful accord and have
perfect confidence in their representa
tives in the conference. We are now
awaiting a solution that will be com
patible with the dignity and honor
of the Mexican nation. All of the gen
erals of the de facto government are
in complete harmony and stand united
behind their government."
Conference Made Progress.
Washington. May 3. Unofficial ad
vices from El Paso on yesterday's
Scott-Obregon conference indicated
that the conferences made distinct
progress owing largely to the reported
conclusion of Obregon that the Amer
ican government could not be per

REMOVE PAROLE e
BOARD DEMANDS
WOMANLEADER Emma Sells Marshall in Chal
lenge to Governor Capper.
Fire Board or Accept the Re
sponsibility for Signature.
WOMEN WANT PROTECTION
"Who Are These Persons Who
Signed Petitions' antf Papers Vt
Must Kansas Girls Face Such
Beasts Every Day?
"Major Brown xrys liissell in no
worse than a majority of men paroled
from the penitentiary- I wonder if
KaiiHiiR women and girls must fm-e
such beasts everv day and no one does
anything about it? The governor says
the board of corrections is to blame.
Then whv doesn't he discharge the
board? Whv has he retained two of
the three members who turned Itiaseli
and his kind loose on unprotected
women and children?" Km ma Sells
Marshall.
Following the revelation of a series
of paroles to persons who served pris
on sentences for crimes against young
and unprotected girls, Kansas club wo
men have demanded relief from a sys
tem that removes from women and
children of the state the protection
which the law affords. In a challenge
to Governor Capper anil the state
board of corrections today, Mr
Emma Sells Marshall of Topeka de
manded that Governor Capper remove
the present board or accept "the re
sponsibility checked to Him for sign
ing the Fred Bissell parole and later
giving the man a pardon.
Mrs. Marshall is widely known in
women's club circles in Kansas. She
was formerly parole officer at the
State Industrial school for girls at Be
loit. Through her work in that insti
tution she became familiar with the
method of, paroling prisoners. In a
statement today she declared that In
nocent women and children of Kansas
were paying the price of a record
which the state administration nought
to establish through the parole sys
tem. She challenged the Ftatement of
W. L. (Iron jaw) Brown to the effect
that Fred Bissell. etHified assailant
and murderer of Edna Dinsmore, was
better than a majority of the persons
paroled from the state prison. If the
Brown statement is true. Mrs. Mar
shall declared that the women and
fViiMi-on f tht Mtatp were the victims
and paid the price of the existing sys-
tern.
Must Pay the Price,
"Before I would consent to the pa
role of such persons as Bissell and
some of his kind who I am told have
been permitted to leave the prison, I
would quit my job," emphatically de
clared Mrs. Marshall. "I don't care
what sort of record for prison reform
an administration was trying to make.
Such action means but one thing that
unprotected women and girls of Kan
sas must pay the price.
"Governor Capper denies that he
was responsible for the Bissell parole,
although he signed the papers- The
governor says the board of corrections
is to blame. Then, why doesn't he
discharge the board? Why has he re
tained two of the three members who
turned Bissell and his kind loose on
unprotected women and children?"
Mrs. Marshall then pointed to the
fact that j. E- Porter of Kansas City.
Democrat: and Charles M. Hareer of
Abilene, Republican; were on the j
board when the Bissell parole was
granted. No effort, she declared, had
been made to remove them. Mrs. J.
M. Miller of Council Grove, president
of' the state federation of women's
clubs, is also a member of the board
and was appointed by Governor Cap
per to succeed Major Brown. No ef
fort is made by Mrs. Marshall to shield
Mrs. Miller and the broadside today
directed at the state administration
was for all who might come within
its range.
Want the Xaniefl.
"The women of Kansas demand the
protection the law affords-," said Mrs.
Marshall. "They demand it for them
selves and for innocent and defenseless
children. Yet Major Brown says Bis
sell is no worse than a majority of men
paroled from the penitentiary. I won
der if he is correct? The women of
Kansas demand the names of other
persons of the Bissell stripe who have
been turned loose on the world. I
have been told there are others and
that they received papers in just the
same manner as did this man. I won
der if Kansas women and girls must
face such beasts every day and no one
does anything about it?"
Mrs. Marshall had read of the peti
tions and letters which flooded the
parole board and the governor urg
ing that Bissell be made a free man.
The Topeka club woman wants more
information on the subject.
"Who are these persons who wrote
letters and signed petitions?" demand
ed Mrs. Marshall. "Who are some of
the prominent and influential citizens
who pleaded for this man's release? Or
did someone just present a colorless
petition signed by persons who did not
know its purpose? Or was there a
petition at all? Surely there are manv
people who would like to know about
this matter.

Also a resolution was passed re
questing the supreme lodge to recog

not 'affiliated with the sun rem Jodre.
fwhich is made up of delegates from 1,-
1 00 lodges. With each lodge sending
two or more delegates to the supreme

Ultimatum.
Anxious to Know What
New
U-Boat Rules Are.
Berlin, May 3. The draft of the
German reply to the American note
has been finished. The reply is sub
ject to minor alterations which may
result from interchanges of views be
tween Berlin and general headquar
ters.
The Associated Press is permitted to
make these statements although the
censorship on dispatches tending to re
veal the tenor of the German reply is
still effective- The date of delivery of
the answer has not been fixed
The attitude of Germany will be
stated in clear and precise terms. The
note will leave no room for doubt
concerning the exact position assumed
by Germany, which will communicate
the definite nature of instructions that
will be given to submarine comman
ders and other data, on which Wash
ington itself can judt'e the situation.
First Indication of Plan.
Washington, May 3. The an
nouncement from Berlin that new and
definite instructions are to be given
to German submarine commanders, is
the first positive indication of how
Germany will attempt to meet Presi
dent Wrilson's final demand that she
declare and effect an abandonment of
the present method of submarine war
fare. Whether the new instructions will
meet thi terms of the lp.st American
note and thus prevent a break in dip
lomatic relations can only be deter
mined by a close and careful examina
tion. President Wilson is represented by
those closest about him as unshaken in
his determination that the issue is not
negotiable, that a settlement cannot
be delayed by discussion of side issues
such as the British blockade and re
taliatory measures, and that the con
troversy between the countries can
proceed further In diplomacy only if
Germany effectually stops destruction
of ships without warning and takes
measures to bring her submarine op
erations within the confines of inter
national law.
Wilson Will Demand Proof.
With a declaration that such orders
have been given and evidence that
they will be carried out in good faith,
the president is willing to discuss the
conduct of submarine warfare but only
upon that basis. Until this morning
Germany's delay in making reply and
the absence of any definite reports
from Ambassador Gerard have led
American officials to fear that the
Berlin foreign office was planning to
send an answer which the United
States could not consider other than
inconclusive and therefore unsatisfac
tory. The news that new instructions to
submarine commanders will be an
nounced serve to encourage hope of a

Introduce Resolution of Criti
cism at National Conference.
Saratoga Springs. N. Y., May 3.
Criticism of President Wilson
for providing wine for guests at
banquets at the White House was
expressed in a resolution submit
ted to the Methodist general con
ference today by the Rev. James
Anderson of Oregon, Mo.
The resolution was coldiy re
ceived by the 800 delegates, and
was referred to the committee on
temperance. Although the reso
lution was offered by Dr. Ander
son as an individual, the entire
Missouri delegation supported the
action.
The resolution in part follows:
"Whereas, It has been reported
through the public press that our
president, the Hon. Woodrow
Wilson, has restored the use of
intoxicating liquors on state oc
casions in White House functions;
"Therefore, be it resolved by
the general conference of the
Methodist Episcopal church. That
we hereby express to the Hon.
Woodrow Wilson, president of the
united States, our keen disap- j
pointment and regard for Fame j
action, especially at a time when '
the rulers of other nations have
taken such advanced position
with reference to intoxicating
liquors and when there is such
widespread growing sentiment in
our land in favor of total abstin
nence from all alcoholic bever
ages. We, the delegated representa
tives of more than four million
members of the Methodist Kpis
copal church hereby appeal to the
president as a Christian gentle
man to abolish the wine cup from
all functions over which he has
control, thereby setting & worthy
example and keeping pace with
the forward movements and
Christian sentiment of the day."
