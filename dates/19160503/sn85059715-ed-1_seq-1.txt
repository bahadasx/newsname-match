Over School Building
Lost Creek Man is Taken to
Asylum after Trying to
Kill Himself.
Worry over the cost of a new school
building, which slightly exceeded the
amount provided for it by levy, is be
lieved to have deranged the mind of
Homer Bird, a well known carpenter
of Lost Creek and member of the board
of education of Grant district. Follow
ing an attempt to hang himself with
a rope in a barn, he was brought to
Clarksburg and taken to the Weston
State Hospital, following examination
and commitment by the county lunacy
board.
(Mr. Bird brooded day and night over
the predicament into which the school
board got over the cost of the school
building and became obsessed with a
fear that he was about to be taken
to the state penitentiary. The last sev
eral days his condition became worse
and a day or two ago he got a rope,
put a noose into it and attempted to
hang himself in a bnrn, but was res
cued just in the nick of time. From
that time a close watch was kept of
him In order to prevent him from do
ing himself injury. Mr. Bird is 48
years old and single,

VICE-PRESIDENT STURM
ISSUES II STATEMENT
In Behalf of the Automobile
Dealers Association of
the City.
The following statement was Is
sued Tuesday night by Harry p.
Sturm, vice president of the Clarks
burg Automobile Doalors' Associa
tion, in behalf of the association:
"The Clarksburg Automobile Deal-,
ers* Association appreciates the kind
ly manner in which the general mo
toring public has endorsed irtd ap
proved its action In the matter of
limiting the time extension on credit
transactions and placing on a cash j
basis those customers who have made
such action necessary.
"A very few instances of criticisms'
have come to the attention of the!
writer and, In nil cases, it has hern
traceable to a lark of knowledge rel
ative to th*? policy now in operation
and the conditions that forced Its |
adoption. The majority of complaints,
however, have their basis on the con
tention that the principle of classi
fying the good customer with the loss
desirable is unjust, whereas, in effect,
the present policy actually does dif
ferentiate between the two classes of!
customers and leaves the selection of j
classification absolutely up to the dls-'
cretlon of the customer himself. As
a matter of explanation the writer'
will state that every Instance where'
he has heard this objection It was;
made by a motorist of sound respon
sibility, who has a perfect right to I
challenge any action that would seek |
to question or limit his credit, but,!
as the purpose of the policy now in j
effect is to accomplish nothing other!
than a business basis for deserved)
credit, as liberal as the dealers obli
gations to his creditors will permit, j
we appeal to the business judgment |
and spirit of fair play of the motor
ing public to assist our efforts to!
make our various organizations more
stable and thereby render a higher
character of service than could be
possible under the old system."

EXPLAINS WORK
OF CREDIT MEN
Central West Virginia Associa
tion is a Branch of the Na
tional Association.
(By Bert Kvuns, Secretary-Treasurer.)
Our CriH?tI.
"We believe that wo ought to join
hands and work to make the good
things better and the worst good.
Counting nothing for self that is not
good for all."
We seek no more than this: To
gain for honest merchants the faith
that they deserve; to make the Just
and worthy way, at once the most se
cure and profitable; to draw the fullest
meaning from experience: to broaden
mutual confidence among the noblemen
of industry; to savo the hopeless ven
ture from its own incompetency; to
stop the hand of fraud before its plan
shall reach accomplishment; to serve
with patience and with diligence; and
to champion the cause of "Construc
tive Credits" against "Destructive
Credits."
The recent membership campaign by
the Central West Virginia Association
of Credit (Men, resulting in an in
crease of nearly thirty per cent in
membership, puts the association
among the leaders in West Virginia,
with a membership of sixty-one. An
other campaign has been started to
terminate May 31, with the objoct of
having seventy-five by that time.
The association of credit men, both,
national and local, probably is as little |
understood by the average person as
any organization in existence. Less
than twenty years old, and starting!
with a very small membership, less;
than 600 in 1836, the national associa
tion now numbers over 20,000, and is
said to be the strongesrttisiness or
ganization in the country except the
bankers.
The credit man and his association
are the outgrowth of modern business
conditions. Refore the advent of credit
men's associations dispensers of credit
were a secretive, suspicious lot, espec
ially if in the same line of business.
They were unwilling, as a rule, to give
any information to other credit men
that would enable competitors to pre
vent possible losses to their firms for
fear that it might mean a loss of bust
ncRH to their own houses, or in the
loss of u slow and doubtful account by
rcmson of action being taken quickly
by the IIi'in receiving the Information.
Finally n few men here and there
got together and formed associations
for the promotion of better methods In
the granting of credit. One object wag
protection against fraud and injustice
on the part of some debtors, by the
dissemination of credit Information.
Another object was the passage of
laws intended to prevont certain kinds
of commercial fraud not provldod for
in the statute books, such as the bulk
sales law, had check law and false
statement act.
The Central West Virginia Associa
tion of Credit Men was organized In
November, 3334. and its work Is mani
fest by the splendid increase in mem
bership, since its organization, which
consists of bankers, manufacturers and
Jobbers in Clarksburg, Weston, Graf
ton, Belington, Eikins, Fairmont, Buck
hannon, RurnsvlUo ant) Sutton.
The credit interchange and adjust
ment bureau of the association 1s one
or the principle features of Its work.
This bureau is maintained for the pur
pose of collecting and classifying
credit information, and Is now being
managed by U. R. Hoffman, former
superintendent of the Bradstreet Com
pany office of this city, who took
charge April 37.
The steady growth of this city In
population and commercial import
ance, Is thus roflccted in the progress
and enthusiastic spirit of the associa
tion of credit men. The city should be
proud of this as wol las of its other
business organizations, and see to It
they are kept alive by showing an in
terest in their welfare, which Is the
welfaro of tho city itself.
June 13 to 16 the national associa
tion of credit men hold their annual
convention in Pittsburg, where repre
sentatives from ever)- state In the
union will gather to discuss credit and
other business problems and condi
tions. The Pittsburg association has
reserved 2.000 rooms for the visiting
members in tho leading hotels of Pitts
burg. and w4 are looking forward to
a largo delegation for the West Vir
ginia associations, whose headquarters
will bo at the new William Pcnn hotel.
