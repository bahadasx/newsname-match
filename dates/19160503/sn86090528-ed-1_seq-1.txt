TO REDUCE
ACCIDENTS
IS OBJECT
Labor Commissioner Holds "Safety Tirst''
Meeting of Oil Mill Managers;
Discuss Methods of Protecting
Men from Injury
Continuing tho campaign which he
launched more than a year ago, W.
G. Ashton, state labor comirissioner,
held a meeting of oil men in this city
yesterday for the purpose of discuss
ing "safety first" methods with a view
to reducing the number of accidents
to workers engaged in the industry.
Representatives from Duncan, Ryan,
Anadarko and the two Chickasha oil
mills were present, the meeting being
one of a series of gatherings of the
kind w hic h Mr. Ashton has been hold
ing over the state.
At these meetings managers and
superintendents of mills go through
the plants with Mr. Ashton, making
observations ai:d studying the prac
tical problems that are encountered,
the plan being to work out and agree
on standards and the best devices for
protecting the workers. "Our object
is to get an expression of the best
thought among the men engaged in
the Industry and decide on the best
way of meeting the various problems
presented," said Mr. Ashton. "As
rapidly as possible we propose to go
through the same course with all of
the larger industries in the state. The
employers are showing the right dis
position and the co-operation we are
receiving is wonderful."
Mr. Ashton estimates that since the
state labor department began its
"rafety first" crusade, something like
$,-O0,li00 has been spent in all indus
trial plants in the state for safety
purposes. "We have issued about
40,00 orders to 3,HK plants, calling
for Improvements and changes of va
rious sorts," said, tho commissioner,
who stated that it usually cost from
1000 to 11.100 to put an oil mill in
first class condition and from flOO
$12.1 to equip a gin with all necessa
ry safety appliances. One of the oil
mill men here yesterday estimated
that accidents in the industry had
been reduced 50 per cent by the
"safety first" campaign.

STARTING
FIGHT ON
FAKE AD
Merchants Launch Campaign Against
Smooth Schemes of Strangers Who
Pocket Local Coin; Co-operation
in Work is Urged
Although there was scarcely a quo
rum present at the Retail Merchants
association meeting last nigh there
was some good w6rk done.
An advertising committee was ap
pointed by President Rsinheimer; ti.o
work of this committee is to pass on
nil fake advertising such as hotel di
rectories, etc. Thousands of dollars
are wasted annually by the merchants
of Chickasha in such advertising, it
was declared.'
Commenting on the campaign
against fake ad schemes and other
matters coming be fore the meeting
last night. Secretary Ersland said:
"When a stranger comes to Chick
asha now with a grand advertising
scheme, each merchant will refer him
to the secretary of tho Merchants' as
sociation, who will call on the adver
tising committee and if the plan is
wormy uiey wui endorse it. It is
doubtful, however, that any stranger
will have his plan endorsed; ' ie
has a good thing, K-t some one in
Chickasha reap the benefits, and keep
this cash at home.
"The matter of paying annual state
dues was also brought up; each mem
ber of this association should pay the
annual state dues, whic h is only $2.00
per year. The State association is re
sponsible for havin? obtained some
very good laws whic h are a great
thing fo the merchants, such as the
bad check law and garnishment law.
It was the unanimous opinion of
those present last Jiight, that each
merchant pay the state dues immedi
ately. "The subject of the advertisements
which we have been running in the
Express and Star was also brought
up. Good results have been received
from each of these advertisements
but as we lack funds at the present
time for this work, we will have to
discontinue it for the present. If
each and every mei chant in' Chic-kasha
would co-operate with us, our re
sults would be greater.
"There has been a great demand
for a new rating, book since we had
our advertisement in the Express; no
action was taken at the meeting last
night in this lino, as there were not
enough members present."
