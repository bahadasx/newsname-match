(United Proas staff correspondents
Washington, May 3. Hope of defin
itely disposing of the submarine is
mie before Sunday, the anniversary o'
the Lusitnnia horror, waned today when
mio'fficinl dispatches from Berlin said
that the reply to the American subma

fa order to reach Washington by Sat
urday, the note should be cabled tomor
rav night. While this is possible it is
regarded as rather improbable.
It seems certain that when the note
is cabled it will have the approval of
nil Clermans, from the kaiser to
j'oople's representatives in the roich

ficials say, to set a time limit for t'
jinsrt'or. As long as Germany is obvious
ly seeking to solve the difficulty if is
nut. likely that America will complain.
Pending the reply, .-ulimarines have
refrained from their "present meth

upon which the young socialist says he

blasphemous man and an invorate

The quotations stated that Washing

and a pint of beer daily over a period
of 25 years, that he had a distillery in
his own yard and carried a liquor chest
throughout the revolutionary war. A

The Saenz girl told Colonel Dodd

Gives Use of Mexican North

EACH GOVERNMENT MUST
RATIFY THE AGREEMENT
Americans To Patrol North
While Mexicans Chase
Bandits In South
By E. T. Coukle.
(I'uitcd Press staff correspondent.)
El Puso, Texas, May 3. American
troops are to remain in Mexico without
interference from Carranzistas, accord
ing to an agreement reached by War
Minister Alvaro Obregon and General
Hugh Scott, chief of staff of the Uni
ted states army, after a conference last
ing 13 hours.
The agreement wim reached at Wiid
night. Obiegijn mud Scott emerged
smiling from the room, refusing to in
dicate the outcome. In a statement is
sued earlier in the evening both said
that "Negotiations in progress would
probably result in satisfaction to ail
concerned."
General Fred Fuuston was eliminated
from the conference. This was obvious,
although no official objection to his
presence was given. Funston strolled
about the lobby during the meeting,
and this pointed to an indication that
the negotiations haa been robbed of
their military aspect. Funston was re
ported to have clashed with Obregon
during the first conference.
May Use Railroads.
Obregon granted permission for the
expedition o have full use of the Mexi
can Northwestern railway and prom
ised to cooperate ns 'fully as is pos
sible with General Pershing and his
forces, it wns stated reliably. In re
turn, Scott is unofficially reported to
have set a CO day limit on the presence
of American troops in Chihuahua.
Scott's concessions are not definitely
known, however, and it is believed the
war department will shortly give out
the program agreed upon.
The conclusions of the conferees will
not be effective, however, until they
are ratified by the Mexican and the
United States governments.
Emerging from the conference, Scott
went to his private enr and dispatched
a long telegraphic report to Washing
ton by special wire. Whether there
will be additional conferences is not
definitely known but both war lMid.rs
are expected to remain on the birder
for some time. Scott indicated tlmt the
attitude of Washington wnld decide
whether another niptariu' wnilj be
necessary. Obregon wns silent.
Some Mexican Hot Air.
An indication that the conference
was reaching an amicable :id,mstme:it
was seen early when Obvg.m came
from the meeting. When Obregon re
turned to the conference roon, Ad'dph
De La Huerta dictated the following
message to Carranza.
"Information in negotiations now in
progress will terminate complete satis
faction nil concerned."
President McQuatters of the Mexican
mine owners association, arranged the
last conference. He is head of a com
pany owning large mines in Parral,
which were looted recently. McQuatters
invited Obregon and Scott to luncheon
at the Del Norte hotel, ostensibly to
discuss the tendency of Mexicans to
blame the de facto government for lack
of employment. Obregon came openly,
Scott surreptitiously.
Obregon impressed Americans here as
being the strongest Mexican ever seen
on the border.
Will Make Rush Campaign.
By Carl D. Croat.
Washington, Muy 3. An early termi
nation of the campaign in Mexico is
whnr the Srott-Obregon agreement
means, in the 'lCw of authorities here
today. Ilninpeicd heretofore by the
necessity of maintaining strong com
munication lines in almost parallel
rows, General Pershing has not had the
free rein desired. The UBe of the Mex
ican Northwestern railroad, granted by
War Minister Obregon, means that it
will be utilized by troops in trailing
Villistas. The only thing remaining is
Carranza 's o. k. This, it is believed,
will be given.
The agreement for an established
baHe at Oolouia Dublun means that the
present base will be moved northward
eight miles. In effect, this agreement
is what General Scott's original or
ders -sought.
Americans will patrol northern Mex
ico while Carranzistas chase the Vil
listas southward. A short, qiitcK clean
up is in prospect. When Funston feels
that the scourge of border raids is
eliminated, the American troops can be
withdrawn.
The way may be clear for the state
department to "treat" with Mexican
envovs on the subject of the withdraw
al of troops, nnlims Carranza unexpect
edly thwarts whst Scott and Obregon
have accomplished.

P. K Pearze, James Connolly
and One Unknown Faced
Firing Squad
London, May 3. Announcement that
P. II. Pearze, James Connolly and one
other Irish rebel leader had been ex
ecuted was made by Premier Asquith in
the house of commons today just a mo
ment after the resignation of Augustine
Bixrell, chief secretary for Ireland, had
been mada public.
Asquith stated that the three men
shot to death by a firing squad had
signed the proclamation announcing the
establishment of uu Irish republic. This
statement eliminated the possibility of
Sir Roger Casement being the third man
killed, as his name was not attached to
the proclamation.
They were the first rebels whose ex
ecution was publicly announced. All
Irish prisoners have been remoyed from
Dublin. Three hundred, including sev
eral leaders, were brought to England
today. The remainder were tuken to
Beltast under h-ei. y guard.
The swiftness of tho government's
action was a surprise. There had been
no previous announcement of a court
martial. Birrell's resignation was ex
pected. Ho was forced from the cabinet
by a heavy fire from the newspapers
and public.
It is understood that the resignations
of General Friend and Under Secretary
Nathan will follow. All rebels are be
ing tried with great rapidity. It is be
lieved that the rebels who fought in
tho ranks will be leniently treated.
No official information was obtain
able as to the course the government
may take with regard to Irish rebel
prisoners wtio have been brought to
Knglund for trial. It was pointed out
that in the Boer revolt and the recent
indian mutinies only the lenders were
executed. Those in the ranks were len
neutly dealt with.
It was intimated that the third rebel
executed signed the proclamation of an
Irish republic. Following are those who
signed that document besides Connolly
and Pearce:
Thomas J. Clarke, Sean MncDiarmad.
Thomas McDouough, Lnmon Coaunt and
James Pluukett.
Other signers of the Irish republic
proclamation were sentenced to three
years imprisonment.
Pearze was a highly educated man,
head master of a boys' school in Dub
lin at the time of the outbreak. He
led the assault on the postof fice whict
resulted in its capture. On Thursday of
last week he was wounded in the leg
and surrendered unconditionally, l.ntei
he issued a proclamation calling for his
followers to drop their arms.
Connolly was also wounded. His name
was found signed to a number of pass
ports discovered on prisoners, with the
title, "Commander of the Army of the
Irish Republic."
Swiss System of Military

Investigator Says Income Tax
Should Yield $400,000,000
Annually
BUT IT PRODUCES ONLY
This Sum Represents the
Earnings of 600,000
Laborers for One Year
Washington, May 3. Secretary Mc
Adoo is directed to furnish congress
with a statement showing whether
$320,000,000 is being annually with
held from the treasury by income tax
frauds and evasions, in a resolution
offered ii. the house today by Repre
sentative Keating, of Colorado. Mc
Adoo is asked why he has not recom
mended to the president that all income
tax returns be made public in order
that, fraud may be checked. Keating
said he based his resolution on tho
chnrges made by Basil M. Manly, chief
investigator of the industrial relations
commission.
Manly, in a published statement, de
clared that more than $400,000,000
should be received annually instead of
the $S0,000,000 actually collected. The
resolution asked whether:
Fifteen billion dollars was paid in
wages and salaries during 19.14, $500,
000,000 being paid to them receiving
$3,000 a year or more; whether more
than $300,000,000 yearly above the
$3,000 exemption is received as income
from fees; whether $20,000,000 is re
ceived as income from ownership of
property and the conduct of business
above the $3,000 exemption; whether in
comes received by persons subject to
income tax total $20,80(1,000 and wheth
er, with all proper deductions, tho
figure should be $12,o00,000.
In introducing his resolution, Keat
ing said: "You may discount Manly 'e
charges HO per cent and still have a
sum which makes all other fraunds
perpetrated seem insignificant. Three
hundred nnd twenty million dollars rep
resents the income of 000,000 working
men who have labored every day in the
year. The nation's pension rolls are
enormous, but the sum which Manly
says the millionaires of this country
steal yearly could pay it twice over."
TWO BADLY INJURED
IN RUNAWAY ACCIDENT
(Capital Journal Special Service.)
Dallas, Ore., May 3. Mr. and Mrs.
II. R. Kckort and Miss Bertha Brandon
berg, a seven-year-old child, were se
riously injured in a runaway last .Sun
day morning on the Salt creek road
about six utiles from this city wben
their horse becoming frightened at a
passing motorcycle going at a high
rato of speed became unmanageable and
ran away, throwing the occupants of
tho buggy out to the side of the road.
Mr. Kckert was rendered unconscious
aud remainde so far several hours after
the accident, an examination by a phy
sician discovering that he had a couple
of ribs broken. Little Miss Brnndcn
berg had several bones in the back of
her head fractured and she was
brought to the Dallas hospital where
she is resting easily. The occupants
of the motorcycle went on after the
accident without offering any assist
ance to the injured people and an effort
is now being made uy the officers to
locate the parties.
For Its Citizens

Down in Texas the folks got along al-j

men anil tne sneritr, nut me minute
you suid 'United States marshal' they
pricked up their caxs.
"American folks don't like to be
governed by Washington."
Luigi Corti had his Texas folks
right. He had a lot of other Ameri
cans right, too. This little blue book
would mean that you were tabbed and
listed by the federal government.
Some yearn ago this would have
sounded more un-American than it does
today, because in reality you are now
tabbel and listed on the feder.il in
come rolls. But this little book of
military service and citizenship would!
keep you in your niche, right under the
eve of the federal military authorities,
all the time.
If you left Chicago to live in Cleve
