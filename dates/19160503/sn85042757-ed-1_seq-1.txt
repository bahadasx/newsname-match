SPLENDID EXERCISES.
Graduate! Acquit Themselves Well and
are Given Diplomas and
Certificates.
The cloung exercises of tbt High
School at the Baptist church Wednes
day night broagbt ont a crowded bouse
The rauisc furnished by the Mary
ill quartette was of a high order and
waa richly enjoyed by all present.
The orations by the graduates proved
fall of good thought and all received
marked attention by the audience.
As is always the case some ot the par
ticipants showed a little more than
ethers the effects of stage fright and
some of the voices were less strong
than others, which made what they bad
to say less easily heard, but on the
whole they did splendidly and in no
sense could it be said there was a fail
ure. The class address by Dr. W. F. Kus
ael was splendid. He did cot attempt
lights of oratory but his talk was so
full of good sense and sound advice,
presented in a very pleasing and forci
ble manner, that everyone enjoyed it
to the highest degree and heartily ap
proved of what he said.
rue diplomas and certificates were
presented by Prof. Frank March.
Much to the surprise of many he pat
in about thirty mintues scolding others
and praising himself. He scolded the
High School board because Ave out of
six of those gentlemen refused to em
ploy him for another year. He scolded
all who opposed bim and his efforts.
He found fault with the editor of the
Chronicle because we Had declined to
publish an artiele seat as If fit. Wm.
ft. Bourne. State High School Inspect
r. He read the article and praised
himsalt lor the great work he felt he
had done for our people through the
school high. He closed by declaring
that he had aerved the Cumberland
County High School aa faithfully as he
had served his Cod.
After he had closed his remarks the
writer arose and stated that the reason
why we had not published the artiele
from Prof. Bourne waa that the conduct
and reputation of Prof. March had been
such that we could not consistently do
so and we so wrote Prof. Bourne.
Some persons favorable to Prof. March
made a demonstration against the
writer, which only went to show that
people here are much the same in some
ways as elsewhere. That is, they will
not accept the truth when it goes con
trary to their wishes.
We have stood squarely tor honest
and clean thinga and have nothing
(o retract nor any apologies to make
to any one for what we did for we
know we spoke the truth.

rested, but was released oa bond of
$25,000 the same afternoon. Men sign
ed, the bond wbo are said to be worth
as a whole over one millieji dollars.
The killing is the outgrowth of the
prosecution of the graft eases that nave
been on in the courts for ome weeks
touching the administration of city
affairs, in exposures have been
inort glaring and much ot what has

PREVENTION BEATS CUKE.
Seventy-six out of eighty-seven eases
ot typhoid fever which occurred in a
recent outbreak have been traced by
the United States Public Health Ser

cases been reported to a trained health
officer the outbreak coald have been

! coming year. Prof. John A. Miller
was nere from Knoxville and he was
offered the place. In case he accepts
his daughter will be engaged as his
assistant.
Instead of Mrs. Olive K. Barnes, the
teacher in tbe domestic science depart
ment will be Miss Dona Reynolds, of
Bolivar, N. Y. Miss Renyolds is at
this time lecturing to hospital nurses
and giving instruction in a hospital at
Jamestown, N. Y., at a salary of $50
a week and board. She had a place
awaiting her tor the coming year at
$75 a month, but she decided to -come
here for $60 a morth.
Her father, J. H. Reynolds, is an
oil dealer, owns several hundred acres
of land a few miles sonth of Cross
ville. He has recently bet n here an
arranged for developing tne property
and has Ernest Fields on the propetty
now farming. Mr. Reynolds and wife
wish to pass the winter here and have
induced their daughter to accept the
place here at the lower salary in order
to be with them. Miss Reynolds wired
Chariman G. A. Haley Monday that
she would accept and the deal is con
sidered closed.
The work of Mrs. Olive K. Barnes
has been along very helpful lines and
has been generally considered success
ful. Her many friends will be very
sorry to see her go.

accept on account of desiring to take
some advanced work as a student.
The work of Miss Waters has been very
satisfactory and it will be with regret
that the board will see her go, in case
she decides not to return.
Prof. John Rose was engaged for
another year at an increased salary.
The work of Prof. Rose has met with
the most pronounced approval of the
people generally and it will prove
very pleasant news that he is to be
with the high school the coming year.
In connection with other uiatterr
that came before the board for con
sideration was a bill presented by
Prof. Frank March for $40 for teach
ers he had employed the past year to
assist him in undergraduate work.
The board felt that Prof. March had
no authority for employing teachers
and declined to pay the bill
BURROS ARE HIS BEST PALS
Sixty-Year-Old Prospector, Starting
Life Anew Causes a Sensation
In San Francisco.
Harry H. Cloud, sixty years 'young,"
with his camping outfit of two burros
and a cart, has walked 1,750 miles
across burning desert and rugged
mountains to get a "start in life!"
And "Mlrandy' Cloud has estab
lished the long-distance w lker's rec
ord for babies of ten months. "Miran
da" is one of Cloud's burros.
Cloud, who abandoned his mining
"prospect" 30 miles from Prescott,
Ariz , spread his blankets In the shad
ow of the Tower of Jewels, outside the
exposition ground at San Francisco.
The glitter and glare of the exposi
tion has never had a more colorful
contrast than this picture of sturdy,
sun-bronzed age in top boots and
khaki. The "tenderfeet" of the city
stood amazed.
Traffic piled up on Market street as
the strange caravan from the desert
plodded down the great business ar
tery. Crowds followed. Men cheered.
Babies cooed in glee.
"Sell me the baby burro?" said a
Miss Louise Burton.
"Won't part 'er from r mother,"
replied Cloud.
"I'll buy them both," said Miss Bur
ton s sister Mabel. "How much?"
Ten thousand dollars," answered
Harry.
"O!" aatd the girls. Then they
gasped again.
"Well, these 'ere burros are my only
pals," said Cloud. "Would you value
a friend at less 7 I'm start la after a
fortune. IT1 need It when I get old.
An' I've got to have friends to help
get It If I have the $10,000 I wont
need burros for friends. That's proved
philosophy Get 'ap there. Jlnniel"
Last week a trade oeal was closed
whereby H. W. Leydig, Dixon. Illinois,'
became owner of the Crossville Mer
cantile Company store building and
stock. Mr. Leydig is a prominent
manufacturer ot Dixun, Illinois, and
made the trade for purely speculative
purposes. The consideration was class
ed as a $15,000 deal.
The Mercantile company, through J.
S. Cilne, closed out the store property
and over 100 acres of wild land fcr a
farm of 117 acres rear Dixon, Illinois.
The smallest price that land is sell
ing adjoining this farm is $155 an acre.
Mr. Leydig was acco panted by H.
L. ForiJhain, also of Dixon, who assist
ed in arranging the details of the trade.
After the trade was closed Mr.
Leydig interest! d G, M. Martin & Sons
to tne extent of buying the Mercantile
Company stock ai d they took charge at
once and began arranging it for busi
ness. Just what they will do in the
way of stocking up and opening up a
general store they do not know as yet
for some details remain to be adjusted
that will decide that.
It is possible that parties from Dix
on will come here and open up a large
department store, which will include
putting in a new stock uf not less than
$10,000. That, however, is a matter that
v ill be determined ty Messrs Leydig
and Fordham after cor.sulting with two
active young men 'hey expect to back
in the enterprise. Mr. Fbraham is a
wealthy banker and said he would back

pressed the view that in the event the
department store was established there
would be a banking department con

very much impressed with the pros
pects of the country for development
and especially by the large percentage
of cash business that is done.
Nothing definite is likely to be
known as to their plans short of sixty
days.
OVERALL AND HOOPER.
The republican state convention is in
session at Nashville today and there is
every indication that John W. Overall,
of Middle Tennessee, will be .-elected
fer the candidate for governor and
that former Gov Ben W. Hcopev will
be the candidate for United States
senate. Terry Ahernalhy, of Wost
Tennessee, seems likely to receive the
nomination for railroad coinciiaeioner.
JOHN A. PATTEN DEAD.
John A. Patten, of Chattanooga, cued
in Chicago last week as the result of
an operation. He :. one of the most
progrcsssive and eupable business men
of al) the southland and was held in
very high esteem by tbe leading
people of Chattanooga and many other
southern cities.
He was a ninmber of the M. E.
Church and had spent many thousands
ot dollars in assisting that organisa
tion but his benefactions had not been
confined to his owr. church. Every
cause for the betterment of mankind
throughout the southland had both his
personal encouragement and his finan
cial assistance. Numerous churches
throughout East Tennessee practically
owed their life to his generosity.
The M. E. church here was continu
ally being aided by hioi as he contri
buted $160 a year to its ministerial
support.
As a business man and a philanthro
pist be was a very sirong force in
Chattanooga and over the state and
his death causes a loss to every good
thing that is almost irreparable.
