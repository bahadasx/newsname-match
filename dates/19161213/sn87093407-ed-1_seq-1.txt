SANTA CLAVS TO BRING 'MOVIES' TO FIRLANDS?
For Seattle's Good-
Wipe the Slate Clean
Seattle's best interests demand
new blood in the proposed consolida
tion of the Chamber of Commerce and
Commercial Club.
A COMPLETE reorganization
is imperative. No middle-of-the road
proposition will do.
The old must go, with all its rancor, fac
tionalism, clique rule and class distinction.
A fresh, virile, progressive program must
begin. Consolidation of the two clubs, while
necessary, is not, in itself, the ultimate goal to
be achieved. The merger committees, now sit
ting in conference, should ponder this well.
A CIVIC BODY, LIKE A NEWSPAPER,
MUST HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE
PEOPLE IN ORDER TO BE AN INFLUENCE
FOR THE GOOD OF THE CITY.
The Chamber, especially, has been Jacking
this. It must be representative—representative
of the whole city, not representative of one
group only.
To this end, towards securing and HOLD
ING the people's confidence, must the proposed
consolidation dedicate itself.
Otherwise, President Suzzallo, of the University of
Washington, and the others called upon to effect a consoli
dation of the Chamber of Commerce and the Commercial
Club will be wasting their time.
The city has suffered greatly in prestige because
these organizations have been FAILURES.
Let not sentimental considerations for the personal
feelings of individuals identified with these FAILURES,
stand in the way now.
Never has there been so much promise for Seattle as
a whole.
We need, therefore, more than ever before, a
organization representative of the whole of Seattle.
We need a civic body in which Seattle, as
a whole, will have confidence.
Wipe the old slate clean in both the Cham
ber of Commerce and Commercial Club. We
need NEW blood. We need live wires.

MANY TUBERCUURS WILL SEE
PICTURE SHOW FOR THE FIRST
TIME XMAS-IF YOU WILL HELP
Joe Newberger thought up the idea fiist. Joe is assistant cashier at the
Seattle National bank.
"Why not give a Christmas moving picture show for the folks at the Fir
lands sanatarium?" Joe asked John Von Herberg, movie magnate, treasurer
and manager of the Greater Theatres company.
"Why not, indeed?" replied "Von." "Count me in on it."
"Why not," suggested Jimmy Crehan, secretary to Mayor Gill, "try to
get enough money together to buy a moving picture machine? Then they can
have a movie show just as often as they want to?"
We of The Star heard about it.
"Why not," we said, "let the readers of The Star in on it. We'll bet
they'd like to help."
So there you are, folks. We hope you will not disappoint us.

U. S. PART IN
PEACE PLAN IS
UNDETERMINED
BY CARL D. GROAT
U. P. Staff Correspondent
WASHINGTON. Dec 13- What
part the I'nited States will play in
furthering Germany's suggestion
for peace is undetermined today.
Hut these three ideas are in offi
cial minds:
That England and her allie*
' should at least discuss the of
fers.
That any settlement, espe
cially in Germany's present
frame of mind, would have to
be backed by a world guaranty
of peace.
That the U. S. wilt not b*
stampeded in the peace move
ment
On the whole, the sentiment here
is that the I'. S ought merely to
act as messenger for Germany and
pass on her proposals.
President Wilson is undecided;
lie has not even told his cabinet
what he thinks. Hut his closest
followers believe this nation ought
to know what the elites think of
the offer before making any move.
Furthermore, they say frankly
they believe England will scorn the
offer.
In these l ircumstances. America's
course must be cautious, officials
hold.
The I'nited I'rtss obtained its In
formation today from four of the
best Informed men in touch with
the administration. Its main in
form ant «:is one of the foremost
men in the councils and confidence
of President Wilson.
