Music Club Holds Profitable
Session. Men's Prayer
Meeting Interesting.
, The December meeting of the W.
C, T. JJ. was held with Mrs. James
White with a good attendance; a
cordial welcome was given each one
and a white bow was pinned on, but
some already had theirs on.
Miss Zena Payne presided, and
the opening scripture was one of
Praise for the W. C. T. U. over
the land, had done much through
the help of God for prohibition.
Mrs. Olin Eidson offered a prayer
thanking God for these blessings.
The committee, who had the pe
tition for prohibiting the sale of in
toxicating drinks, stated that it had
been turned over to proper authori
ties. Mrs. White reported having
made a visit to Governor Manning
while in Columbia relative to this,
Our town has had frequent visitsl
by carnivals, and a committee was
appointed to see the one who had
charge of the municipal license and
protest against this. The W. C.
T. U. has always stood for moral
uplift, and this Union hopes to be
able to assist iii preventing the oom- j
ing of the one looked for Christmas
week.
The ot ,erving of December 10th
was discussed, and the president
stated that she had b id notices of
the day published and had request
ed the minister* of the town to of
fer special prayer for national con- j
stitutional prohibition.
A communication was read from j
Mrs. Joseph Sprott, concerning the
Lillian Stevens Campaign Fund,
and the Union will have a part in
this. The very interesting letters
from the national convention, of
the State President Mrs, Sprott,
were discassed, and the news of the I
national convention aa gleaned from
the Palmetto White" Ribbon' had
beea greatly enjoyed.
The subject for the afternoon was
"Rescue Work," and forceful arti
cles on this were read by Mesdames
Olin Eid8on and James White. The
latter has charge of this department
and the box for the "Door of Hope"
will be packed in her home, to be
sent off the last of Jaquary, and
several present ga^e contributions
to be sent later. 1 je meeting dos
ed with, a prayer by MTB.- L. C.
Latimer, that God would bless this
department of work to His good.
Mrs. O. D. Black, historian of
the Mary Ann Buie Chapter, has
been made State District Historian
of the Edi8to District. It is through
her efforts along historical lines that
the Chapter came first in the State
at the recent State Convention, and
the Chapter is glad that this honor
has come to ber.
Mrs. W. J. Hatcher was hostess
for the Apollo Music Club on Tues
day afternoon, and as the Club now
numbers 25, the large room was fill
ed, there being several other guests.
Mrs. Mims Walker opened the
meeting with the Lord's prayer, and
during business, the Club decided
to have the Christmas Carols on
Christmas eve night, following the
old custom which originated in the
14th century. In England, now
carolers are still to be heard ueber
ine in the dawn of Christmas at
midnight and early aawn. Hut the
Club will only carol during the ear
ly eveniner hours.
How could the true Christmas
spirit be brought to the minds and
souls of the town people in a more
beautiful way, than by the voices
upon the clear night air, of "Peace
on Earth, Good Will to Men."
Just as the Waits of merry old
England brought glad tidings of
great joy to all people, so the Music
Club can do their part in awaken-'
ing the beautiful Christmas spirit
the love spirit.
A committee was appointed to
arrange for the carol singing, Mrs.
Jamee White, Misses Gladys Saw
yer and Zena Payne.
Upon the suggestion of Mrs. J.
W. Marsh, the Club will make a
contribution to the Belgium Christ
mas Fund, and she, with Mrs. T.
R. Hoyt, will ?arrange for this, f
The subject for the afternoon was
"Guiseppe Verdi," the great opera
composer, of Italy. He has been
characterized "the musician with
the helmet," and no composer so
well merits this distinction, for he
has literally placed a girdle of mel

People around here have about
finished sowing grain, and haye
put in a big crop. And for tE'e

ton crops are short, but the price
has made up for the shortage.
Corn and hay crops were very good
and on the whole people around

several years. I don't think tlioy

of farming from too much dei

Interesting Letter by Pupil of
Mt. Zion School.
Dear Mr. Mims:
I don't think you will mind pub
lishing a letter in your paper ?from
a school girl, so here it comes.
First, I will try to tell you about
oar Behool. Jost six miles from
Trenton on the "Old" Plank Road"
in a little grove stands Mt. Zion
school house. It is a modern school
building with modern equipment.
When we started to school on Oct.
2nd, we found that our sohool
house had not been forgotten dur
ing vacation, as it was newly paint
ed, inside and out, and our furniture
varnished, new blinds added to the
school house and the broken lights
replaced . Our teacher is one who
believes there's always room for
improvement. We have been clean
ing our grounds at noon hour for
three days this week.
We are blessed with conscientious
and energetic trustees and teacher
and I feel sure that you all agree
with me that we are indeed fortu
nate to have Mr. Fulleras Superin
tendent. Miss Mamie Cheatham of
your town is our teacher, and Mess.
E. M. Padgett, Jj H. Smith and M.
W. Carpenter are the trustees.
When I think of what they have
done and are etill doing for the
school, I'm reminded of Longfel
lows words,
"Let us, then, be up and doing,
With a heart for any fate;
Still achieving, still pursuing.
Learn to labor and to wait,"
and I'm sure there's comfort and
encouragement in them.
For the past three Thanksgivings
we have had a box party at the
school house for the beuefit of thej
school. I'm thankful to say they
have always been successful, but it
gives me pleasure to say that the
last wa? the be?t of all, as eleven
boxes and one cake walk brought us
$28.25. We are indeed grateful to
all who came. A portion of this
money goes for decorations for our
Xmas iree and the othar for a new
organ for school and Sunday School.
Let me. here, in behalf of the school,
thank each and every one of you
who has contributed so generously
for our new organ.
Miss Cheatham has twenty two
pupils enrolled, ranging in grades
from first through the tenth. The
pupils making the honor roll this
month are:
1st grade, Carraell Smith; adv. |
1st, Arthur Pritchard; 3rd grade,

and still expect to put in more this
week. There seems to have been
more than usual sown this fall.
Seed wheat and oats seem to be
hard to find in Augusta.
Things are beginning to .nove
early. That is hands for another

are for the better,- for the one that

worth his salt, and we pity the
ones he has gone to.
