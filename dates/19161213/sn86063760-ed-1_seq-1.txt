Berlin, Dec. 12.-The Chancellor
said the propositions which Ge
many was bringing forward had
for their object the guarantee of
existence, of honor and of liberty
of evolution for the four allied
(Central) powers.
Berlin, Dec. 12.-Via Sayville
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg's
speech is reported by the Overseas
News Agency as follows:
Chancellor von Bethmamnli-Hollweg
today announced to the Reichstag
that Germany with her allies, "con
scious of their responsibility before
god, before their own nations and hu
manity," had offered peace negotia
tions.
Members of Parliament answered
their unexpected sumons hurriedly.
'fhe thronged galleries listened in in
tense silence while the Chancellor
rose for his speech.
The Chancellor first outlined the
extraordinary political situation, and
* nspeaking on the achievement of
kntral powers, made an an
oment which may possibly be
turning poipt in the war. He said:
"The Reichstag had not been ad
journed for a long period, but fortu
nately it was left to thq discretion of
the president as to the day of the
next meeting. This decision was caus
ed by the hope that soon happy
events in the field would be recorded,
a hope fulfilled quicker, almost than
expected. I shall, be brief for ac
tions speak for themselves."
Serious Situation.
The Chancellor said that Rumania
had entered the war in order to roll
up the German positions in the east
and those of Germany's allies. At
the same time the grand offensive on
the Somme had as its object to piece
.be German western front and the
wed Italian atacks were intended
o paralyzze Austro-Hungary.
"The situation was serious," the
hancellor continued. "But with God's
elp, our troops shaped conditions
o as to give us security which not
nily is complete, but still more so
han ever before. The western front
tands. Not only does it stand, but
spite of the Rumanian campaign,
is fitted out with larger reserves of
en and material than it had been
rmerly. The most effective precau
ns Lar , been taken against all
lini 'Sversions. And while on the

rn Wallachia, and the hostile
al of Bucharest, leading wvith uin
leled genius the troops that in
ration with all the allies made
le what hithertofore was con
d impossible.

f 'ndations for our economic

ofg',rain, victuals, oil and other goods
fell ito our hands into Rumania.
Their transp~ort has begun. In spite
of scarcity, we could have lived on
our own .supplies, but now our safety
is beyond1 question."
Exi~loits of Submarines.
,"To tlie great events on land," the
harellor continued, "heroic dieedls
are d(ded by our submarines. The
specter of famine which our enemies
intended- to \appear before 'us now

If the enemy counted upon the weari
ness of his enemy, then he was de

"The Reichstag, by means of the
national auxiliary war service law,
helped to build a new offensive and
defensive bulwark in the midst of the
great struggle," the Chancellor con
tinued. "Behind the fighting army
stands the nation at work-the gi
gantic force of the nation at work
for the common aim.
"Inexhaustible Resources"
"The empire is not a beseiged fort..
ress as our advers tries imagine, but
one gigantic and firmly disciplined
camp, with inexhaustible resources.
That is the German empire, which is
firmly and faithfully united with its
brothers in arms, who have been test
ed in battle under Austro-Hungarian
Turkish and Bulgarian flags. Not con
fused by asseverations we progressed
with firm decision and we thus con
tinued our progress always ready to
defend ourselves and fight for our
nation's existence for its free future
and always ready to stretch out our
hands for peace.
"Our strength has not made our
ears deaf to our responsibility before
God, before our own national and be
fore humanity. The declarations for
merly made by us concerning our
readiness for peace were evaded by
our adversaries. Now we have ad
vanced one step further in this direc
tion.
Emperor's Responsibility.
"On August 1, 1914, the Emperor
had personally to take the gravest de
cision which ever felt to the lot of a
German-the order for mobilization
which he was compelled to give as a
result of the Russian mobilization.
During these long and earnest years
of the war, the Emperor has been
moved by a single thought: How
peace could be restored to safeguard
Germany after the struggle in which
she has fought victoriously.
"Nobody can testify better than
this who bears the -roponsibility for
all actlg of the government. In a
depp moral -and religious sense of
duty toward his nation and beyond it
toward humanity, tie Emper'or now
considers that the moment has come
for official action toward peace.
"His majesty, therbfprej in com
plete harmony and in cdommon with
our allies decided to propose to the
hostile powers to enter into peace fie
gotiations. This .ndrning, I trans
mittedI a note to this etlfert to. the hos
tile powvers, through t'he? rapf-esenta
tives of these powvers which are
wvatching over our interests and
rights in the hostile States. I asked
the representatives of Spain, the
United States and Switzerland to for
wardl that note.
"The same procedure has been
adloptedl today in Vienna, Constanti
nople and Sofia. Other neutrals and
the Pope have been similarly inform
edl.

Washington, Dec. 11.-Private ad

telling of the secret proceedings in
the French Chamber of Deputies dur
ing the last week confirm previous
reports that Gen. Petain, the defender
of Verdun, is to succeed Gen. Joffre

as the first result of radical changes
in orraniznation which are to follow
ron:-entr:ition of management of the

Gen. Pertain was a colonel at the
outbreak of the war.
Radical Changes.
Paris, Dec. 11.-Premier Brianl
was busy all day Sunday, seeing not
only politicians, but prominent busi
ness men and manufacturers in view
of the new combination to facilitate
which all ministers and under-secre
taries will hand in their resignations.
In the meantime, according to the
Matin, the reorganization of the
higher command in the army being an
essentially administrative question,
will not be settled until after the new
government elects the Chamber of
Deputies on Tuesday.
"In addition to forming a . war
council of five ministers ori the model
of that in England," continues the
Matin, "Premier Briand has decided
in the interest of the economic or
ganization of the country to throw
the old administration machinery in
to the melting pot and oblige all min
isterial departments hitherto con
gealed in superannuated methods, to
get in line with the rest of the coun
try which is freely spending its
blood and gold.

Exciting Session. is
There was tumult in the Chamber a
of Deputies today during the discus- t
sion of the military appropriations (I
bill, when the Socialist deputy, Pierre
Brizon, declared Frenchmen should 1
no longer fight to assure the posses- a
sion of Constantinople to Russia. E
"You're a traitor," wa yelled at Mr. a
Brizon by numerous deputies.
M. Bribon's colleagues endeavored a
to quiet him but, without avail and n
during the excitement he threw a a
water glass at the heads of the dep- p
uties in a semi-circle before the see- 'I
retary's desk. Thereupon a suspen- C
sion of the sitting was ordered. p
M. Brizon was hooted by the entire S
chamber as he moved alone to his t
place among the Socialist seats, which q
mostly had been vacant during the t:
tumult. After the chamber had re- n
convened it was announced that M. a
Brizon having outraged the assembly, t
the chamber would consider an appli
cation for his temporary exclusion. a
M. Brizon, demanding the right to
be heard, on the application of the
rule, declared that M. Bouge hal h
gravely insulted him by asking "how y
much did you receive from Germany
to do the work to which you are ap
plying yourself?"

London, I)ce. 1 1.-The associat.d
Press has received from Amsterdam
un "appeal to the Americatn people"
on behalf of' the Bielgians by the 1101

1 l'resident Niemeyr and Secretaries
I )ebafaillc and Waltch. It follows:
"Your 'resident has said that soon

when the war would make the posi
tion of neutral nations unbearable.
For us I lollanders that moment has
arrived; not through our own suffer

passively contemplate the ghastly
suffering inflicted by Germany upon
Belgimii, our neighbor.
"The eloquent protests of the Bel

clergy have acquainted you with the
facts. A glance at the section of The

liberately drags the Belgian fanilies
apart. To us this cruelty is more
vivid every day. Every day numbers
of fugitives, in spite of the deadly
electric wire which the Germans have
erected along the frontier, succeeded
in escaping to The Netherhamds. From
