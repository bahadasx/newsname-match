LONDON, Dec. 13. Newspaper
comment and the public's utterance
indicated that Britain will refuie the
peace offer. The prena and people
expect Lloyd George to voice the na
tion'! anawer In addressing the House
nf Commons Tuesday. Germany's
terms are called preposterous and
unworthy of serious consideration.
It Is uncertain whether the allies
intend to nam their own terms In the
reply. The Dally Mail said: "Hollweg
Is no more entitled to a repljMhan
an armed burglar." The Manchester
Guardian suggested that Germany's
exact terms be ascertained. Many
newspapers urged that Lloyd George
clearly state Britain's peace terms.
They declared such a statement would
make the world realise Germany was
responsible for the continued war
fare.
Philip Snowden, a leading pacificist
urged the acceptance of Hollwers of
fer. He declared the allies would In
cur an awful responsibility If they
declined. He asks for a complete In
vestigation of German terms. Many
believe the offer Is merely a ruse to
produce dissentlon among the allies.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13. British
diplomatic circles expressed the belief
the allies will conditionally refuse and
not flatly refuse. Germany's peacs
proposals Officials declared a flat
refusal would be playing Into Ger
many's hands. More aggressive, un
restricted submarining would certain,
ly result.
One British official said he believes
sterner measures against the Belgians
would follow a flat refusal. The Ger
mans would take the opportunity to
carry out "the military policies neu
tral opinion has hitherto discounten
anced." It Is believed Lloyd George
may evade a flat refusal, declaring
that Britain cannot negotiate because
the peace terms were not stated.
BONE DRY LAW IS
TO BE PROPOSED
SEATTLE, Wash., Dec. 13. A total
Piohlbltion law, forbidding entirely
the Importation and possession of in
dicating liquor except for sacramen
tal purposes and restricting the salo
of alcohol, will be Introduced at the
session of the state legislature in Jan.
uary.
Decision to present the measure was
mude by more than 100 prohibition
workers from all parts of the state at
a meeting held In the Young Men's
Christian association building today
under the auspices of the Anto-Saloon
league of Washington.
The measure provides for abolition
of the pertmnnl permit system which
went Into effect January 1, 1916, and
of the druggists' permit system Inso
far as It affects any liquor except al
cohol. The penalty for orfpnses against the
proposed law are much severer than
thoxo provided under the present lnw.
f'onvlrtlon of a third violation of the
proposed lnw hy an offender would
constitute a felony, with Imprison
ment in the penitentiary.

Supreme Court Also Declares Xo
Facts to I "rove Prejudice on Part
of Justice Parke Were Established
in Suit of Mayor Best.
"The law does not vest in the ac
cused the discretion of selecting the
court in which he will be tried," says
the opinion of the supreme court In
iing Circuit Judge Phelp, re-
fU8aJ to 188116 a writ ot mandamus to
' compel Justice of the Peace Parkea to
4 grant Mayor Best a change of venue.
I Mayor Best asked that his case be
; transferred to another court for trial
'on the grounds that Judge Parkes is
' so prejudiced against him that a fair
and Impartial trial could not be had
! before him. Such prejudice the law
' makes as grounds for a change ot
I venue, but, in its opinion, the supreme
. i court in substance holds that the pre
judice must be clearly shown to ex
ist. The only thing In the record be
fore the court to show that Judge
Pafkeg 'is prejudiced against Mayor
Best is the mayor's allegation that
said prejudice does exist. "No facts
i are stated," the opinion states, "by
which an Impartial judge could reach
the same -conclusion." If inch an al-.
legation Were all that the law required
it would be an easy thing for. any ac
cused person to choose the court In
whlrV we-wnnM tttaad trial.--.
"In the very nature of things." the
opinion reads, "the judge (Parkes) Is
called upon to determine his own bias

cer. The law does not vest in the ac
cused the discretion of selecting the
court in which he will be tried, yet he
could enforce that as a principle if it
were sufficient for him barely to say
that the judicial officer is prejudiced
against him."
Copies of the opinion were received
this morning by the attorneys inter-
ested. A certain time must elapse
before a mandate is made during
which time the mayor has the rrivi-
lege of asking for a writ of review.
In sny event it is very probable that
the trial of the mayor will not be ser
for a date prior to Jan. 1 which means
that R. I. Keator. the district attor-
ney-elect. will probably handle the
case for the state. ,

that In the last analysis the home
t must be the best substitute for the sa

men do not do hIr nrt fn m.lrW

the highed idealism of the younger

the fact that they spend a great deal
more time in the company of their

no satisfactory solution may be found
of this particular aspect of the prom,
