overshadowed by the pending peace
proposals of Germany and her al

commented upon by the press of

lack of definite knowledge of the
terms upon which Germany and the
opwers allied with her are willing
to offer.

Washington, D. C Dec. 13. Presi
dent Wilson's course of action in con
nection with Germany's peace pro
posals remained undecided today while
he awaited the official proffer which
the central powers have asked the
United States to transmit to their ene
mies. The impression grew that while the
president's first consideration was to
safeguard his usefulness as a peace
maker by omitting any comment which
might possibly be coupled with a re
jection by the entente powers, there
was a disposition to find some way.
however, delicate and informal, to in
timate the sincere wish of the United
States that some basis for discussion at
least might be reached.
The United States, by reason of Its
dual responsibility of representing the
interests, of most of the central pow
ers and the entente governments in the
capitals of their enemies, would, ot
course, become the medium of commu
nication through which any reply of
the entente governments to the central
belligerents would be made.

The Germanic diplomats In this coun
try, reflecting the view of their gov

the basis on which Germany proposes j
peace and with that much as a founda

they are sanguine peace will result, j

"What is still more certain is that
the treacherous German move aims at
something else than genuine peace. It
seeks an internal and external effect.
In Germany it is intended to convince
the people that the government is not

struggle. Abroad it desires to persuade
neutrals that the allies are pursuing a
policy of ambition.

"It is because Germany knows she

It will fail before the immovable reso

The Matin characterises the peace
proposals "as mere talk." saying:
"They contain no territorial,. political

point out that seven ministers and two

The most popular feature of the

the fact that Gen. Nivelle is half Kng

If the press which supports the ad
ministration correctly Interprets offi
cial opinion, little time will be taken
up by conisderation of the move of
j Germany and her allies, although the
i moderate opinion of the country does
not favor too hasty rejection of the
overtures. It is believed the German
people, once acquainted with the ob

inclined toward peace and that for that
reason, if for no other, the terms of
