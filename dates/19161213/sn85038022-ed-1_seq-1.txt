In reply to charges made against
R. F. D, Carrier In the Dover News,
last Issue, I will aay that I am not
guilty of the charge preferred
against me by Mr. Perrlne Osborne on
the night of November 11. I was no
Instigator of any trouble at all. 1 was
approached by certain parties who
were looking for trouble, and all I
did was in self-defense. Postmaster
Mitchell was instructed to Investigate
and return the evidence to the De
partment. I objected to Mr. Mitchell
taking the evidence and asked him to
send for an Inspector on the grounds
that Mr. Mitchell had voluntarily
told me and others, should there be a
vncancy, he would be an applicant
for my position; also said he had
written Mr. Fields, M. C. for his sup
port, and had received a reply from
him. I have served as R. F. D. Car
rier for the past twelve years. In
that time 1 have always tried to do
my duty, be accommodating and
courteous to my patrons, and to con
form to all laws, rules and regula
tions of the department. And all I
am asking of Mr. Mitchell and the
department Is a fair and Impartial
hearing. Mr. Mitchell told me he
sent the department twelve state
ments. Most all of these were from
my enemies. I consider all that has
been done was through malice, spite,
envy and jealousy. C. R. NOWER.

has been at $7.86 per hundred. Yes
terday's sales ranged from $7.25 to
