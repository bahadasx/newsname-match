LACK OF TERMS
HANDICAP PROGRESS
OF DEAL FOR PEACE
Awaiting Definite Knowledge of German Profers Before
Taking Action; General Tone of Entente Comment Is
Not Optimistic as to Probable Success of Overtures
BRITAINS ATTITUDE MAY BE MADE
KNOWN TOMORROW IN COMMONS
Teutonic Newspapers Lay Emphasis Upon Offer as Sign of
Strength Rather Than Weakness; Germans Continue
Advance Through Wallachia; Capture 7,000 More
Prisoners
London, Dec. 13.—The indications are that the various govern
ments of the entente allies do not intend to act hastily in making
joint response to the peace proposals of the central powers. It was
pointed out in well-informed quarters to-day that while each one of
the allied governments might indicate its general attitude, consulta
tion among the allies under the treaty binding them to such action
probably would require two or three weeks, making it unlikely that
the joint reply of all the allies will be available before the first of the
year.
Fighting is continuing on the battlefields of Europe but inter
est in the operations is overshadowed by the pending proposals of
Germany and her allies.
The proposals are voluminously commented upon by the press
of both the entente and Teutonic "allies, but with the handicap of
lack of definite knowledge of the terms upon which Germany and
the powers allied with her are willing to discuss peace. In general
the tone of the entente press comment is not optimistic as to the
probable success of the overtures. German newspapers lay empha
sis upon the offer as a sign of strength rather than weakness. Great
Britain's attitude, according to London dispatches, may be made
known in the House of Commons when it reconvenes to-morrow
provided the time proves sufficient for her to consult with her allies
More Rumanians Captured
Military operations within the past twenty-four hours have
developed important happenings only in the Rumanian war area.
Here the Teutonic armies are continuing their advance in eastern
Wallachia. Berlin announces that the Rumanian resistance has
been overcome along the Jalomitza river, where a stand had been
made bv the Rumanians reinforced by Russian cavalry. The
Rumanian armies arc reported again in full retreat to the north
east, presumably falling back upon the line of the Buzeu, close to
the southern Moldavian border.
More than 7,000 additional prisoners were taken by Field Mar
shal Von Mackensen's armies yesterdav.

Big Voluntary Increase
on Pennsy Rumored
Reports of a general increase in
wages for Pennsylvania Railroad em
ployes were widely circulated in llar
risburg and vicinity to-day. One re
port was to the effect that a general
; increase of 10 per cent, would be
' (shortly announced, and effective after
1 January 1. Another story was that
1 employes would receive a bonus of
$lO per year each year they have been
;in the service. This bonus, it is said
; will be made in monthly payments.
A man working two years would be
: paid a bonus of S2O. One who has
! been in the service 15 years would
J get $l5O or $12.50 each month in ad
dition to his regular pay and so on.
These rumors have been in circulation
for two weeks. Bast week it was de
! nied at the office of General Supertn
l tendent George W. Creighton at Al
i toona that any increase was contem
plated.
To-day the board of directors of the
Pennsylvania Railroad is in session at
Philadelphia. Superintendents of the
various divisions were summoned to
be present. This has given rise to the
I belief that there is something doing.
: Superintendent McCaleb was at this
j meeting and nobody at the local offices
i knew anything about the reports.
