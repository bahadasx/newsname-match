Reichstag Building During the Session.
The Teutonic allies declare
them-
elves ready to discuss peace. Also
they are ready to continue the war if
the entente allies do not find the time
propitious for such a discussion.
The readiness of the central powers
has been made known in identimal
notes to United States, Spain and
Switzerland, who are asked to make
known contents of the notes to the na
tions at war with the Teutonic al
lies. Notes also have been transmit
ted to the Vatican and the active in
terest of the Pope in the peace offer
solicited.
While no conditions for peace were
mentioned in the notes, it was assert
ed that the propositions to be made by
Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey
and Bulgaria would have for their ob
ject a guarantee of the existence, of
the honor and the liberty of evolution
for these nations and would prove "an
appropriate basis for the establish
ment of a lasting: peace."
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
In communicating: to the reichstag the
fact of the despatch of the notes said
the stop was taken on the ground of
humanity. The Teutonic allies, he
said, could not be conquered and they
awaited the answer of the entente
Rllies.' with that seriousness of mind
wbidh Is guaranteed to us by our ex
terior and interior strength and by our
clear conscience."
The identical notes said in respect
to a refusal of the entente to agree to
discuss peace and reconciliation that
the four Teutonio allied powers are
reeoulved "to continue to a victorious
end. but they disclaim responsibility
for this before humanity and history."
Emperor William has addressed a
message to the army and navy, saying
lhat with consciousness of victory he
had made offer of peace but whether
It would be accepted was uncertain.
"Until that moment arrives you will
fight on," the message concluded.

HOW PEACE PROPOSAL IS
REGARDED IN WASHINGTON
President Wilson - Deeply interested
But Reserving Comment.
Washington, Dec. 12. Germany's
proposal for peace is regarded here as
having broken the chains which for
months have restrained the United
States as well as other neutrals from
making offers of. mediation..
Now that one. set of belligerents has
signified its willingness to discuss the
peace terms a condition often reiter
ated as necessary to any action by
President Wilson there are indica
tions that when the United States, act
ing as the intermediary, transmits the
Herman proposal it may accompany its
action oy some steps, necessarily deli
cate, to tnrow the influence of the
United States Into the balance for at
least a consideration, however pre
liminary, of the terms on which a last
Ing peace might be brought to the
world. Some ranking officials of the
American government believe a league
of nations uch as President i l'son
has suggested must be the outcome
nd it cou'd not be perfected without
the participation of the United States.
Whether the United States will
transmit the German proposal without
any, comment whatever, or accompany
it witn some formal or informal ex
pression. wi'l not be - finally decided
ontil the note delivered to American
Charge Grew in Berlin reaches Pres
Ident Wilson s hands, probably tomor
row. There were indications tonight
that President Wi"on might find some
wav to express the solemn and earnest
wish of the United States for a care
ful consideration of the suggestion of
peace. eVe before the entente govern
ments have mode known tlvir attitude
toward the German proposal. This, it
was pointed out, would necesarily be
done in such a delicate and -ultr-con
fldential way that it never would be
pi'ilicly known should the allies de
cline the offer. This course was said
to Be absolutely necessary so as to
leave the United States free and un
embarrassed to act when an ecceptable
peace oner comes.
Regardless of whether resident Wil
son c'l "idea to accompany the German
proposal with any word, it was said
tonight he unquestionably would take
steps to learn the attitude of the en
tente allies toward the peace move and
possibly might send to Europe his
personal friend and advisor. Colonel
E. m. House.
REICHSTAG BUILDING
SURROUNDED BY THRONG
People Were Intensely Interested in
Chancellor's Action.
Berlin, Dec. 12. After reading the
note in the reichstag, the chancellor
saia:
Await the Answer of Enemies.
"lienuemen: In August, 1914, our
enemies challenged the superiority of
power in the world war. Today we
raise the question of peace, which is a
question of humanity. We await the
answer of our enemies with that se
renenes of mind which is guaranteed
to us by our exterior and interior
Btrength and by our clear conscience.
If our enemies decline to end the war,
if they wish to take upon themselves
the world's heavy burden of all these
terrors which hereafter will follow
then even in the least and smallest
homes, every German heart will burn

LONDON COMMENT ON
1 s PEACE PROPOSAL.
Evening News Declares the Offer is
Almost Blasphemous.
London, Dec. 12. The late editions
of the evening newspapers . comment
sarcastically on the German peace of
fer. The Evening News says that
Inasmuch as the Germans have obtain
ed their "maximum of plunder" and as
"the avenker in the shape of Lloyd
George- is about to inflict punishment,"
Germany now desires to make peace.
"The chancellor's declaration Is al
most blasphemous," the News con
tinues. "After the crushing of the citizens
of Rumania and the deportation of
French and Belgians, the kaiser and
chancellor place on the allies the re
sponsibity for continuing the war."

joining streets were thronged. The
people were intensely interested and
the imperial chancellor, on his arri
val, was cordially greeted in the usual
fashion.
The chancellor began his speech in
clear, loud, ringine voice. His first
utterances were greeted with applause
on all sides and at frequent points in
his speech the assembly assented in
demonstrative fashion. Later, how
ever, when he touched upon the Ques

made themselves felt, the applause
coming mainly from the Catholic cen

BRITISH OFFICIALS ARE
MAINTAINING SILENCE,
Peace Move Has Not Created Any Im
pression on the Average Londoner.
London, Dec. 13, 12.10 a. m. A strone
current of public sentiment opposed to
tne uerman peace proposal was evi
dent in the first expressions available
last mgnt Dotft from, public men and
the isritish press, although these were
witnout knowledge of any definite
terms and without any word from high
aut-iorltative sources indicating the
attitude of the government.
The only information in the press
reports was from Berlin and In the
absence of some tangible official prop
osition British officials were disposed
to maintain reserve. It was noticeable
that the proposal had not created any
profound impression among the aver
age Londoners. There was little talk
In the hotels or other public places,
and this discussion was far less ani
mated than in the recent ministerial
crisis .
Government circles also held aloof
from any discussion, with an evident
desire to learn more of the details be
fore committing the new administra
tion to a definite course-of action. The
foreign office woull make no com
ment, in the absence of the terms, but
indicated that the British attitude up
to the present was embodied in the
declarations made from time to time
by the former premier and Viscount
Grey and that any new proposals
would have to be considered by all the
entente alliea before a definite attitude
was possible.
Some early expressions ' indicating
the general drift of sentiment here
were as follows:
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle: "We want
to know more about the forms, for
without them the imperial chancellor's
suggestion of peace is preposterous
and ridiculous. We. too, arc conscious
of victory, and his boastings will be
laughed at."
The -Marquis of Londonderry: " "We
have got to win the war. Peace at the
present time would be -disastrous to
the nation and the empire. It is only
a question of time and we will win out
absolutely."

EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF
STOCKS OF PRINT PAPER
Manufacturers to Meet Publishers'
Committee For That Purpose.
Washington, Dec. 12. At the con
elusion of the federal trade commis
sion hearing on print paper prices to
day the manufacturers proposed to
meet a committee of the National Pub-
Ushers' asosciation to work out, for
the cossission's approval a plan for an
pquitable distribution of the stocks of
print paper.
The manufacturers proposal came
s an unexpected development when
the trn-y- commission, after finishing
with publishers as witnesses, called on
the manufacturers to present their
case. Newspaper owners had told of
wide differences in paper prices in va
Xious parts of the country and of the
Inability of many small publishers to
obtain paper at any prices.
Counsel for the News Print Manu
facturers' association, which controls
a large share of the output; declared
It had been impossible to analyze in
so short a time statistical facts pre
sents by the commission's investiga
tors at the outset of the hearing; that
the chief complaint was from small
publishers unable to get paper because
of the increased demand and that the
manufacturers, after conferring, had
decided they were open to any pro
posal for an equitable distribution of
their product.
Most of the newspapers of the coun
try, including some 10,000 small dailies
and weeklies, were represented direct
ly or through national and state pub
lishing associations. It was brought
out tnat the increased price of ner
paper to them amounted to aaout $80
a ton and that to papers using fifty
tons a year it meant an increased cost
of $4,000 which in many cases would
wipe out the paper's entire profit. Wit
nesses - told the commission that al
ready many papers had been forced
out or Dusiness by increased paper
prices and that hundreds had no
chance fr survival unless there is an
immediate reduction.
COLLECTING INFORMATION
RELATIVE TO HIGH PRICES
Also Studying Laws to Cope With the
Situation.
Washington,. Dec. 12. Progress in
the government's inquiry into the high
cost of living was confined largely to
day to further collection' of informa
tion relating to the subject and to the
study by department of justice officials
of existing laws to determine whether
they are adequate to enable them to
cope with the situation.
Attorney General Gregory announced
that he would determine wjthin a few
days, after further study of data in
nis possession, whether he would rec
bmmend to the president that con
gress be asked to pass additional les
islation.
In congress Representatives Sabath
and Farr introduced resolutions. The
Sabath resolution would direct the
secretary of commerce to inquire into

Chicago. Dec. -12. Germany's offer i
today to make- peace smashed the
wheat market. Sealing became almost
frantic, especially after what purport
ed to be the main points of the bffer
were learned.
Prices Fell 11 1-4 Cents a Bushel.
Prices fell in some cases 11 1-4 cents
a bushel and closed wild at 1C5 1-2
to 3-4 for May and 142 3-4 to 143 for
July, with the market as a whole 4
7-8 to 10 3-4 cents under yesterday's
finish. Corn lost 2 1-2 to 2 3-4 cents
net and oats 3 1-8 to 3 1-4 cents. In
provisions the outcome was a rise of 6
to 55 cents.
Market Had Been Weak.
Although the first flash of peace
news reached Chicago at near'.y the
exact moment of the opening of the
wheat market, it was not until a quar
ter of an hour later that tradars in
general were aware of the announce
ment which had been made at Berlin.
Meanwhile the market had been dis
playing weakness that was ascribed
for the most part to the stoppage of
export sales and to the chance of a
serious disagreement between Wash
ington and Berlin over attacks by sub
marines. As soon as despatches pp
peared in print, however, telling of the
German offer to negotiate for peace,
owners of wheat bct-'an to throw h".H
ings overboard seemingly without I m-
it and prices plunged downward in
good earnest. Fully an hour and a
half went by before e-citsment sub
sided and then only to flame out a?ain
when near the end of the day at
tention was centered on Washington

bassy setting forth a statement n'd to

Developments except in regard to
peace cut little if.anv figure.
Corn showed stubborn resistance t

wheat. Some liquidation owinfr o the

volume of offerins-s could not be de

NEW YORK STOCK

By Scope of Peace Proposals From
Germany Bankers Were Surprised.
New York, Dec. 12. Unsettlement
bordering upon demoralization over

nouncement of peace overtures by
Germany and her allies. Dosses of

Wall Street, particularly tr?,.se sub
stantial banking interests whose ram
ifications are world-wide, several days
ago received an inkling that develop
ments of paramount importance were
proceeding in Berlin, but the scope and
extent of today's advices far exceeded
any forecasts. '
Ear-kers Were Surprised..
Bankers whose connections with the
central powers are admittedly close
m?do no effort to conceal - their sur
prise -and the powerful interests rep
resenting the entente allies seemed un
prepared for the news. . Neither of
these groups would discuss the peace
proposals for publication,: but the in-
fero.nre gatnwea rrpm mgn sources -j
w'!r-tYm t .'tT?iff(?--to'T--wld not-'-
seriously entertain negotiations . : at
this time. . ' ;
Not the Psychological Moment. -
In .o-ca!!ed neutral quarters, the
nririion was expressed that Germany's
forms, as outlined by her diplomatic
representatives, were far more com
prehensive than ' had been expected.
Nevertheless,' It seemd to be the more
general orir.ion that the psychological
rr.omcnt for a peace gathering was still
crr-c months off. In this connection,
ntice wa st-ken of the fact that ex-r-.ar,c-e
en Germany and Austria' to
rlr.v moved farther away from those
i-ount-ies than before, with recurrent
weakness in rat" on Italv and Rus

EELGUIM'S GRATITUDE
TO THE UNITED
STATES
Conveyed in a Letter Delivered Per
sonally to Secretary, Lansing.
Washington, Decv 12. Belgium's
gratitude to the United States for its -representations
to Germany against
the deportation of Belgians was ex
pressed by Minister Havenith today In .
a letter delivered personally to Sec- -retary
Lansing. The letter follows:
"I have the honor to inform Your.
Excellency that I have received in-.
struction to express to you the deep
gratitude of His Majesty's government '
for the noble action which the gov
ernment of the United States has been
good-enough to take in approaching
the German government on the subject '
of the deportation of Belgian civilians
and for the great interest taken by the
United States government in the de--fense
of the unfortunate Belgian com
munities which have already under
gone such cruel trials.
"In exile and slavery, to which
these unhappy people are being drag
ged by an oppressor who no longer .
knows any law. either of God or of
man, they have the moral support of
hearing the voice of this noble conn
try proclaiming the new immutability
of these principles of justice and free
dom which are so dear to all civilized
people, but above all dear to the Unit
ed States for in defense of these prin
ciples one of the greatest of her pres-:
idents, Abraham Lincoln, gave all,
even his life blood." . ' .
