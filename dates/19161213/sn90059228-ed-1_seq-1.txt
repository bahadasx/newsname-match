The Spirit of Christmas.
"Peace I Earth Good Will Toward
Men," though of lowly origion has
been echoed and re-echoed around
the world since it was first spoken.
The modern method of spreading
this spirit is best exemplified at
Christmas time The desire to make
others happy is then in the airit's
contagiousit's all pervading. Even
the grouch, as exemplified in Pick
ens' Christmas Carol feels the tug
at his heart-strings at this time.
The simplestthe easiestthe
best way to make others happy at
Christmas, is by giving appropriate
giftsgifts that will make for hap
piness. In this paper you will find
the special offerings of your home
merchantsyour fellow townsmen
who have made a special study of
the needs and desires of the people
of this community and who are best
fitted to satisfy them in every way
and at a saving over what the same
class of goods can be bought for-any
where else.
Let us suggest that you call at
thir4 establishments as soon as pos
sible^ so as to make your selections
earjy and get the benefit of their
large* and complete stocks. You'll
find all goods first-class and strictly
as represented. And best of all, you
will see before you buy. These mer
chants are your neighbors, they de
pend upon you to make their living.
And they cannot afford to handle a
single item with which you will not
be satisfied under the most trying
conditions.

A

1916, at six o'clock, at the elegant
home of Mr. and Mrs. Fred Johnson,
in this city, when their adopted dau
ghter, Miss Ida M. Johnson, was giv

Johnson Miss Ella Lundgren nlay
jed the wedding march as the bride
a,nd groom entered and took their
places before a bower of ferns and
flowering plants. The ceremony was
performed by Rev. N. Anderson in
the presence of a large number of
friends of the contracting parties
Miss Ellen Pearson served as bride's
maid and John G. Holan was l)est
man. The bride was becomingly
dressed in silk mull, wore a veil, and
carried pale pink roses. The groom
was attired in a suit of dark blue.
The bridesmaid wore a white em
broidered dress and also carried
roses. The rooms and tables were
nicely decorated with a profusion of
ceremony congratula
tions were extended to the newly
wedded pair, followed by an elabor
ate and delicious wedding dinner.
The remainder of the evening was
pleasantly spent in jovial converse
and listening to vocal and instru
mental music. The happy couple
were the recipients of many useful
and ornamental wedding presents.
The bride came to Warren as an
orphan child when she was only two
or three years old. The good foster
parents have in her case performed
a deed of kindness which God only
can adequately-reward. But they
have been repaid largely for their
care and trouble by the love and de

ORMALOPENING OF
NEW HIGH SCHOOL
Fine Musical Program and Able Ad
dresses by President Weld, of the
Moorhead Normal School, and
President Lamberson of the Board
of Education.
^SPECTION OF NEW
BUILDING BY CITIZENS.
a The formal opening of Warren's
commodious and well appointed new
High School building took place on
Friday evening of last week in the
spacious new high school auditorium,
where a program appropriate to the
occasion was rendered, in the pres
ence of a fair sized audience. The
first part of the program consisted
of highly appreciated musical num
bers, which included a quartette by
High School Boys', a double number
by the High School Girls' Glee Club,
duetts by Miss Nora Bakke and In
golf Grindeland and quartettes by
Miss Bakke, Mrs. Storaaslie, and
Messrs. Prytz and Grindeland. Miss
Ella Lundgren presided at the piano.
There were also three instrumental
duetts, one by Gladys Grindeland and
Agnes Lundgren, another by Gladys
Mitchell and Bertrice Lundquist, and
still another by Jean Stevens and
Mildred Wood, A piano solo was
furnished by Robert Lundgren
President Weld made an interest
ing address At the outset he con
frj-atulatodfko ppopV vf Wanron-
very nrpttv honf* w^dding^ tpolf^pon having provided such a large
and fine auditorium in the neW high
school building Few towns of the
size, or even much larger than War
ren, have anything that is better. In
order to show the great possibilities
and opportunities for future progress
in the Red River Valley Mr Weld
cited the fact that the ten valley
counties of Clay, Becker, Norman,
Polk, Marshall, Kittson, Roseau, Pen
nington, Red Lake and Mahnomen
had an area of 13,080 square miles
with a population of 150,000, making
11 persons to the square mile. Little
Belgium with an area smaller than
these counties has a population of
7,500,000s or 70Q people to the square
mile. Another fact touched upon by
the speaker was that the best and
most valuable in human life comes
out of association. The history and
literature of America is yet a
formative state and have not yet
acquired the dignity of being nation
al. Our nation is yet in its infancy
and it has been formed by the differ
ent races and nationalities of the old
world who have come together here
to be amalgamated into a new nation
that will contain the best character
istics and tendencies of the various
people from which they sprang. On
this continent, therefore, and in this
Red River Valley, is being evolved
rapidly a strong and vigorous civil
ization, national in its scope. The
public school is the great agency for
welding together the different races
and developing a national life. The
building of school housesthe child
ren's houseswas a step in this
great work and he congratulated the
people of Warren for their enter
prise, progressiveness and patriotism,
the lines of manual training,

vicinity, but removed a number of riculture, nexdon

The New Building.
The new addition to the High
School building contains seven reci
tation rooms, one assembly room 50x
60, one auditorium and gymnasium,
50x70, two cloak rooms, two toilets
and lavatories, two agricultural
rooms, one mechanical drawing room,
one lumber room, one office for sup
erintendent, one room for board of
education, one teacheis' loom, one of
fice for manual training instructor,
cne room for reference books. All
the rooms are large, wel1
lighted ard
ventilated, and finely furnished.
There are also engine and boiler
rooms, a fan room, and four locker
roome and shower bath rooms for
boys and girls.
The old building contains one
chemical laboratory room, one
physics room, one science recitation
room, a library room, a sewing room,
a cooking room, a pantry, an eighth
grade room, a 3rd and 4th grade
room and a first grade room Both
the old and new parts of the build
ing have fine wide corridors on both
floors. The auditorium is furnished
with fine new seats and beautiful
stage curtains presented by last
year's graduating class.
In addition to the High School
building the city has also an eight
room ward building, the Washington
School North Star College, a young
and trifty educational institution, is
also located in our city in a laige
and up-to-date building of its own.
All-this makes Warren an educational
center of considerable importance.
At the head of the Warren public
schools is Supt E. Mitchell, who
by his good and efficient work has
proved himself to be one of the fore
most educatois in the state
The Warren Board of Education is
made up as follows. Lamberson,
President Aug A Johnson, Secre
tary C. E. Lundquist, Treasurer D.

ris.
The cost of the new building is
approximately $60,000.
Some things might be said about
the exterior appearance of the build
ing, which could have been better
had the architect had any eye for
beauty or any ability to harmonize
the architectural lines of the old and
new buildings. But this defect does
not detract any from the utility and
serviceability of the building as a
whole Some time, though, the peo
pie of this city will want to make
certain changes that will add to the
appearance of the building.
HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS WIN
AND BOYS LOSE.
Warren high school made a divis
ion of honors with the players iron
Thief River Falls in the basket ball
games Saturday afternoon. The girls
started the movement by defeating
the girls from Thief River. Our
girls held up the larger end of a 14
to 8 score. Superior speed and team
work on the part of the Warren
team kept the ball in their possession
most of the time. Hazel Edwardth
proved her ability as a star basket
shot both from the floor and foul
line. The work of the guards was
all that could be wished. A large
number of fouls figured in the final
score.
The boys met a different fate. The
Thief River- team gave evidence of
very careful training and experience.
Their offensive work was superior to
that of the Warren boys. It was,
however, evident that Warren has
material for a winning team. The
game ended with a score of 48 to 26
with Thief River sitting on the larg
er end. The Warren team hopes to
make a different story out of the re
turn game to be played at Thief
River January 12.,

VIKING SHIPPING ASSOCIATION
HAS SUCCESSFUL YEAR.
The Viking Co-operative Shipping
Association held its annual meeting
at Viking, on Friday, Dec. 8.
This association was organized, not
quite a year ago, with eleven mem
bers. Considering this, and the fact
that it was the first year of its ex
istence, the association has done a
considerable business. It has now
forty-six members. The total num
ber of cars shipped was thirteen, for
which it has paid to patrons, after
expenses were paid, nearly fifteen
thousand dollars.
Now, this is not a so awfully big
sum for an association of this kind,
but your correspondent considers it
a great help to the commuAity, es
pecially in a year like this, when the
farmers have so little grain (if any)
to sell.
Notwithstanding the rather eold
weather, the meeting was well at
tended, and a great deal of enthusi
asm prevailed.
The old board was unnanimously
re-elected, with the exception of T.
N. Scott, who, for certain reason's,
could not serve any longer. The
meeting extended to the manager,
Henry Sustad, its most heartfelt
thanks, the form of the following
resolution
Resolved, That we, the Viking Co
operative Shipping Association ex
tend to our efficient manager, Mr.
Sustad, our most sincere thanks for
all he has done behalf of our as
sociation, and hope that he will be
able to continue to do the same good
work.as he has always done up to the
present time, and we also wish him
the very best success his endeav
ors to promote the interests of our
association
Immediately after the meeting, the
board convened and organized The
following gentlemen now constitute
the Board of Directors, namely C.
A Lindell, President P. Lmdquist",
Vice President John Batten, Direct
or Gust Sustad, Secretary, and Al

Your correspondent is glad to state
the fact that the association has had

.Grim Reaper Calls Little Boy.
Julius Johan, the four year old
son of Mr. and Mrs Julius J. Olson
died at ten o'clock this forenoon.
The little fellow has been an invalid
for some time. All the loving and
tender care that mother and father
could bestow, was freely given in the
hope that the boy's life might be
spared, and at one time it looked as
if the efforts of the fond parents
had succeeded. But Providence had
decreed otherwise. A change for the
worse set in a few days ago and an
erstwhile happy home in this city is
plunged into deep sorrow. The little
boy's life was brief but it was long
enough to set in vibration heart
string in tune with the Infinite and
which call forth the best and noblest
qualities of the human soul. Julius
Johan has not lived in vain. The
people of this city and friends every
where extend sympathy to the be
reaved family.
r/rT!he funeral will be held from the
home at two o'clock on Friday after
noon.
