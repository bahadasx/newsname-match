INFESTS THREE GEORGIA COUN?
TIES ALONG SAVANNAH
RIVER.
Entomologist Wor*ham Says Cotton
Post Is Threatening Sea Island In?
dustry.
Columbia, Dec. 8.?Th< Mexican
cotton boll weevil has infested three
Georgia counties, bordering on South
Carolina, namely Burke, Emngham
and Chatham, according to a letter
received by E. J. Watson, commis?
sioner of agriculture, from E. Lee
Worsham, State entomologist o' Geor?
gia,
"In Chatham county," says Mr.
Worsham, "It appears to be only 15
miles from the Savannah river. The
advance eastward this year has been
about 150 miles and with a favorable
season next year the southern and
western parts of your State will be?
come Infested by the weevil.
"We are arranging to call a con?
vention of the sea Island growers of
this State some time in January, for
the purpose of having a heart to heart
talk with them on sea island cotton
and the boll weevil and we will be
very glad Indeed for the sea island
growers of your State and Florida to
meet with us. The experiments which
we have conducted for a period of
years on early fruiting varieties of
ssa Island cotton are the only experi?
ments that have been conducted. Our
results are very promising indeed and
we are of the opinion that if the sea
Island growers will pursue tho proper
course, they can continue to grow
some cctton, but there is a great dan?
ger of their becoming stampeded and
trying to grow short cotton instead.
This as you know, will be very dis?
astrous to the sea island Industry. In
view of the fact that Georgia, South
Carolina and Florida raise all the sea
Island cotton grown in this country,
I feel that we ought to pull together
and do everything in our power to
save this industry. Will you be will
I Inf to cooperate with us and urge
eswiMH^ireifflslsnVur^
time In January?
"You are going to And In your work
In South Carolina that you are going
to need all the help that you oan pos?
sibly get from every conceivable
source In convincing the farmers and
business men that the boll weevil is a
permanent and serious factor in cot?
ton production. Your problem m
South Carolina is Identical with that
of Georgia, and I hope that whenever
this department can be of service to
your good people you will not hesi ?
tate to call on us."
VERDICT AGAINST ROCK HILL
Sam Sexton Awarded Sum of Thirty
Ave Hundred Dollars for Accident on
Street.
Rock Hill, Dec. 7.?In York court
Tuesday the jury returned a ver?
dict against the city of Hock- J?11 for
$3,600. The case was that of Sam
Sexton vs. City of Pock Hill and
Holley and Hailey. About a year ago
the plaintiff was riding a wheel and
at the junction of two of the main
thoroughfares collided with a truck
of Holley and Hailey. He brought
suit against tho city for damages be?
cause the light at the Intersection
was not burning and Holley and
Hailey were made codefendants be?
cause of tho collision. The j>< y de?
cided the latter were not lo .dame
but held the city liable because the
light was not burning.
The accident occurred one morning
about 6:30 o'clock, after dawn was
breaking and about the time the city
arc lights were cut off. The city will
appeal the case.
REMOVAL OF BELGIANS.

ment says that thousands of Belgians
are against the Belgian overseas trade.
BURGLARS AND BREWERS.
Bryan Says Brewers art* Greater
Menace to Country than Burglars.
St. Louis. Dec. 9.?"The burglar Is
not nesrly as big a menace as the
brewer and there is no more reason
for defending the brewery because it
is more profitable than in defending
the burglary business,*' was opening
shot of VV. J. Bryan on his arrival at
the meeting of the Federal Church j
Council today. When asked what
remedy he suggested for cities Where
there are huge investments in brew?
eries, he replied, "let the capital be
invested In something else."
LLOYD-GEORGE ACCEPTS OFFICE
KISSES KING'S HAND AS TOKEN
OF ACCEPTANCE OF PRE?
MIERSHIP.
Probably Thinks That He Will Soo?j
be AMe to Complete Coalition Cab4
lnct?Will Receive Support of La?
bor Party.
London. Dec. 7.?David Lloyd-J
George at Buckingham palace to*|
day formally kissed the king's)
hands on his acceptance of the of?
fice of prime minister and first lord
of the treasury. This Indicates that
in an unexpectedly short time theij
new premier sees the way clear
the formation of an administrate
and he probably was able to submit
to tho king a preliminary draft
of the principal proposed ministers.
Doubtless much remains to be don?
in the way of allocation of the new
position and so far as the public li
concerned the personnel of the mln
istry is a matter of pure speculation
But the premier still has plenty ol
time before he has to meet parlia?
ment on Tuesday to complete details,
and he will doubtless be in a position
to present to the house of common!
his new national ministry, represent
ing all parties with the possible
ceptlon of the Nationalists, and,'
common report is to be trusted, col
prising a strong business element
He has been able to gain the sui
port of the Labor party by an of
of two ministerial posts and tl
undersecretaryshlps.
With the vote of the Laborites
gether with the bulk of the Unlonl
and a large section of the Lib*
demanding more energetic proeeoi
tlon of the war, Mr. Lloyd
probably will command a worl
majority in the house of comi
while a further asset will bo
benevolent neutrality even of the]
porters of the late cabinet in
national Interest.
It appears that Mr.. Ll<
George's *plans were only secured
je. narrow jsia^iprlty In tho m<
reoto^ WaWKfoW on the part*f a
section of the party but this Is not
likely to Interfere with the comple?
tion of the cabinet.
The greatest Interest centres In the
personality of the new foreign secre?
tary. Two names are mentioned, Mr.
Lloyd-George himself and Lord Cur
zon. It hi generally assumed that the
latter will be the favorite for the
post, he having had great experience
abroad, and he commands public con?
fidence to an exceptional degree.
The announcement in the court
circular tonight?that he had ac?
cepted the post of prime minister and
first lord of the treasury?seems to
show that Mr. Lloyd-George has no
present intention of taking the for?
eign portfolio, and this apparently
leaves the field to Lord Curzon.
One of the most, interesting mat?
ters still to be decided Is the attitude
of the Irish party. Mr. Redmond
j now has perhaps the greatest oppor?
tunity he ever had to secure a set?
tlement of the home rule question.
ADMITS EIGHT TO BAIL.

MANY SEEEK FARM LOAN.
THOUSANDS OF APPLICATIONS
AUE MADE TO BOARD.
Most of Those Desiring to Know Live
in South and West.
Washington, Dec. 7.?Officials of
the farm loan board announced to?
day that more thain 60,000 farmers
have applied for mortgage loans ag?
gregating approximately $150,000,000
or more than 17 times the amount of
money which will be immediately
available for loans upon the organi
aation of the 12 farm loan banks.
Most of the applications have
|*ome from the South and West. They
still continue to come in by hun?
dreds every day. Requests for ap
RpUcation blanks contemplating re?
quests for loans to 2,000 farmers
have come from Iowa alone.
I Although the location of the
Ipanka probably will not be announ?
ced before December 20, it was said
jtoday that almost immediately after
Organization the banks would find it
Necessary to Issuo bonds for practi
leally their entire capital stock to
meet the demands.
The rate of Interest on bonds is
$now engaging the board's attention,
tt 4s thought that it will not exceed
per cent. Dally conferences are be
ig held by board members with
inkers from various sections to de
mine the minimum rate at which
te bonds will be absorbed by in?
vestors, as this will determine the
Jipterst rate to be charged on loans.
The board also is considering
Whether the bonds shall be offered to
Iindividual Investors or underwritten
nfer banking houses. As the capital
J stock of each bank Is to be only
ff&O.OOO, repeated turnovers of the
ipital and frequent bond issues cov?
ing loans will be necessary if all
applications are to be taken care c'

MONEY FOR ANDERSON COLLEGE
TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
SUBSCRIBED AT DINNER.
Forty Thousand Dollars Needed to
Double Dormintory Space?Cam?
paign Goes on.
Anderson, Dec. 7.?Sixty-five busi?
ness men of this city gathered around
the banquet table at Anderson col?
lege tonight and subscribed $20,125
towards a fund of $40,000 to be spent
on doubling the dormitory capacity
of the college. President White an?
nounced that he had $5,000 more in
sight to be subscribed by several busi?
ness men who were unable to be pres?
ent for the banquet. He also stated
that the executive committee of the
board of trustees of the college had
announced that the members of the
committee would pay off the floating
debt of the college, amounting to $20,
000, if the goal of $40,000 .s reached
for the new dormitory buildings. Dr.
White stated further that the plan of
raising subscriptions would be carried
throughout the country and he is as?
sured that the necessary amount will
be subscribed without any trouble or
much effort. The college dormitories
are crowded beyond capacity and at
least 50 additional girls could
have been secured this year as stu?
dents if the college plant had been
large enough to accommodate them.
The subscription work will be con?
cluded within the next few days and
the board of trustees hopes to be able
to begin work on the new building
within the next few weeks. It will
be recalled that Anderson college was
built four years ago by subscriptions
made by citizens of the county and
was turned over to the State Baptist
convention to be managed and run.
COTTON PRICE DROPPED.
Practicaly One Hundred Points Low?
er Than Close Yesterday. .
The price of cotton today dropped
practically one hundred poinU. Tele?
grams received here indicate that
tribute to this decline. Weakness in
the Liverpool market and the an?
nouncement of the cotton ginning
figures which were very much larger
than expected are1 given as the two
primary causes. Other stated causers
for the decline were the political sit?
uation in Europe, a flood of selling
orders and the finking of large
French vessel.
CHILDREN BURNED TO DEATH.
Charles Perry and Polly Sputz Die
of Burns at Chester.
Chester, Dec. 7.?Two little chil?
dren were burned to death today un?
der circumstances starllingly similar.
Both the little boy and little girl
who were the victims had been left
alone by those who were caring for
them, and each died soon after its
clothing caught fire.
Charles Perry, three years old, son
of Mr. and Mrs. Scott P. Perry, of
Chester, had been left in charge of his
nurse, who went away for a few min?
utes. During her absence, the little
boy fell Into the fire. Efforts to save
his life proved futile.
Polly Sputz, six years old, daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. John Sputz, of Great
Falls, was left alone in a room by an
older sister. The little girl got too
close to the grate, in which a fire was
burning. She ran into the yard a mass
of flames, screaming with pain. The
flames were extinguished by wrapping
blankets about her, but her burns
were so severe she died a few hours
later.

melancholia, brought on by ill health
for which he had taken treatment

a state of mind previous to the shoot?
ing that his wife had become alarmed
and called for aid, and before the aid
could become effective, he had turned
his pistol on himself and sent a ball
through his head just behind the ear.
He was thought to have a chance
for life, but at 4 o'clock he died from
the effects of the wound.
