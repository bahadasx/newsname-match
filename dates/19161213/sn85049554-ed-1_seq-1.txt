her allies tb the hostile governments:
"The most terrific war ever experi

which thousands of years ofwrnmon

which injures the moat precious

"Our alms are not to shatter nor
annihilate our adversaries! in spite of
our consciousness of our military and
economic strength and our readinebS
to continue the war (which has been
forced upon us) until the bitter end, If
necessary at. the same time, prompted
by the desire to a\'old further blood

to enter forthwith Into peace negotia

"The propositions which they bring
forward for such negotiations anu
which have for their object a guarantee
of the existence, of the honor and lib

according to their firm belief, an appro
priate basis for the establishment of a
lasting peace.
"The four allied powers. have been
obliged to take up arms to defend jus

have in no way altered their purpose.
We always maintained the firm belief

No authorized expression was obtain

restoration of Belgium and French ter

German idea was to make provision
for the fptiire neutrality of Belgium
and probably to propose defortiflcation,
particularly of the City of Antwerp.
It was also understood that no con

German Catholic Organ Designates
Note as Indication of Kai«er'a Lovo
For Peace,
London, Dec. 13.—The German peace
proposal is rejected by the London
Times, wl)ich^ays:
"Germany's proposal bears no re
lation whatever to the objects for
which we are fighting:. It is above all
things a symptom of her conscious
weakness. The allies must absolutely
reject any idea of mediation in any
shape or from any quarter as long as
the ibasls proposed is the triumph of
might and not right."
Germany's peace proposal "caused,
the greatest sensation In Scandinavia,
according to a Copenhagen dispatch to
the Exchange Telegraph Company.
The Dagens Nyheder, of Copenhagen,
says it learns in authoritative Swedish
circles that it is believed there tho
German offer will not meet with im
mediate rejection by the allies.
The Copenhagen Politiken believes
that in view( of what has. happened
during the last few days in Russia,
France and England, it is unlikely
that the allies will agree to start peace
negotiations.
Saye Ifa Appeal to Neutrals.
"Germany," aays the Westminster
Gazette, 'Us aware that tlie'war is
producing great linrest-among neutrals
and it is to them rather than to us, in
the first instance, that she is -making
her appeal. It is here that Germany
hw prepared her ground, and it is here
that we have to meet her. We must

posals 'must te made to them jointly,
and that none Will have the slightest
chance of being considered which
^•ould implythat any of them should
betray the other."
The paper "concludes that the allies
must explain to the Americah people—
whose main preoccupation is ift- Bel
gium and France, comments, and
who have no interest in the "eastern
phase of the struggle—the European
struggle ^s the entente sees it and per

mere patching up, which wIJI lead to

space, but for a real reconstruction
which will secure peace and give life

Armistice Not Suggested.
The disposition this morning wis to
withhold comment Inasmuch as the ac
tual proposals'had not been received o^
so far as known, transmitted to the
British government or members of the
entente. It was cxpected this first for
mality woudl be accomplished quickly
and that there would be disclosed vtiftt,
thufe far, has been largely a matter of
conjecture, whether any specific terma
have been put forward by the Teu
tonic allies.
One of the factors which, accoitfiQV
to an opinion expressed here, militates
against acceptance of the proposal IS
that the opening of negotiations would'
necessarily be followed by an armiiltlc^
No specific suggestion of any armistice
Ip made in the proposal so far as indi

but It Is said that precedent of 1866,

DEfMDED BY FRENCH PRESS.
Newspapara In Paria Receive German
Offer With Deriaton.
Paris, Dec. IS.—'The .offer of-peace of
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg is
received with a chorus of derision in
the French press. The newspapers
are unanimous that it is an admission
that the. situation is getting critical In
Germany and" that the chancellor
wants a way out before it is too late.
Hia move is considered to have the
additional advantage that in the evenf
of its failing it will enable him tp
throw the blame for the continuation
of the war on the allies, whk^i he
hopes will have a moral effect on Ger
