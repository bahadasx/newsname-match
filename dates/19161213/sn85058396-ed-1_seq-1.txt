Welcomed.
NEW WAR COMMANDER
General Nivelle Succeeds
Joffre Officer "One of
War's Revelations."
Paris, Dec. 13, 5:45 a. m. Tho new
cabinet arouses but moderate enthusi
asm in the press. The morning pa
pers point out that seven ministers
and two under-secrctarieR belong to ,
tho preceding administration, so that
the change is not so radical as might
bo expected. At the same timo the
appearance of M. Claveillo and M.
Loucheur as technical experts is wel
comed. Tho most popular features of the
re-organization are the appointments
of General Hubert Lyautey as minis
ter of war and General Nivelle as
successor to Joffro as commander-in-chief
of the western front. All the
newspapers print photographs of Gen
eral Nivelle. under the title of "one of
the war's revelations." Long bio
graphs are also published recalling
the general'B brilliant stroke in recap
turing Forts Douaumont and Vaux on
the 'Verdun front. Tho papers also
say that the fact that General Nivelle
is half English his mother having
belonged to a Kentish military family
makes his appointment particularly
acceptable across tho channel.

WILSON'S COURSE
IS UNDECIDED
i
President Awaits Official
Peace Proffer Which Central
Powers Want Forwarded;
U. S. READY TO AID
May Make Some Careful Ex
pression of Sincere Wish for
End of Hostilities.
Washington, Dec. 13. President
Wilson's course of action in connec
tion with Germany's peace proposals
remained undecided today while he
awaited the official proffer which the
Central Powers have asked the United
States toftransmlt to their enemies.
The impression grew that while the
president's first consideration was to
safeguard his usefulness as a peace
maker by omitting any comment
which might possibly be coupled with
a rejection by the entente powers,
there was a disposition to find somo
way, howover, delicate and informal,
to Intimate the sincero wish of the
United States that some basis for dis
cussion at loast might be reached.
, Many officials felt that an indication
r of tho temper of the Entente govern-'
menis suouia De avanamo Deiore tne
influence of the United States was
thrown into the balance.
Dual Responsibility of U. S.
The United States, by reason of its
dual responsibility of representing the
interests of most of the Central Pow.
ors and the Entente governments In
the capitals of thoir enemies, would of
course become the medium of com
munication through which any reply
of tho Entente governments to tho
Central belligerents would be mado.
The German embassy has no further I
advices on tho terms of the Central
governments, but it was frooly admit
ted that terms had purposely been ,
omitted from the chancellor's speech '
and tho note because the sole purpose I
was to propose a conference on terms j
and carefully avoid advancing any
which might be the basis of a rofusal.
Attitude of Diplomats.
The Germanic diplomats in this
country, reflecting the viows of their
governments, believe the answer of
the Entente allies will be an inquiry
as to tho basis on which Germany
proposes peace and with that much
as a foundation they sec the warring
nations well on the way to a confer
ence from which they are sanguine
The probability of the Entente
allies themselves making some an
nouncement of tho terms on which
they would make peaco is regarded
hero as having tremendous possibili
ties for effect upon tho German peo
ple themselves.
President Cancels Engagements.
The president cancelled all his out
side engagements today including one
to preside over the annual meeting
of the American Red Cross, and re
main in the White House, where ho
conferred with Colonel E. M. House,
bis friend and adviser, who made ono
trip to Europe to sound out peaco
sentiment several months. Colonel
House mav r0 atraln If thn nrpdrionf
makes a move to accompany Ger
many's proposals with suggestions of
any character.
It was reiterated that until the offi
cial documents had been received for
transmittal to the Entente, no decision
could be reached as to what tho,
United States would do further than
to transmit them.
London Press Comment.
The London press comment on the
peace proposals is known to be in ac
cord with confident official views com
Ing to this country beforo Chancellor
von Bethmann-Hollweg's speech and
the note published. How far tho com
ment represents tho views of the new
British government can only bo sur
mised. In quarters close to the Entente
allies an opinion prevails that if the
Entente allies made reply, their first
course might bo to inquire what guar,
anteos would be given by Ger
many that the terms of a peace treaty
would bo fulfilled and that a treaty
would not be violatod as, the allies
contend, in tho case of Belgium. By
making such a roply, Entento diplo
mats see the possibility of continuing
tho war.
The president has been urgod by
somo advisers to make his address to
the opening of the conference of gov
ernors here tomorrow night tho occa
sion to express In genoral terms his
attitude without binding himself in
a definite way.
Colonel E. M. Houso left at noon for
New York. He said he had no planB
for going to Europe and would not
discuss tho proposals of the Central
Powers on the ground that tho official
word had not been recolved.

day proposing government ownorship
of the public telephone system in the
capital.
PEACE PROPOSAL
MEETSNO FAVOR
Little Confidence Shown in
London That Any Good
Result Will Come.
NOT OPPORTUNE TIME
i
Possibility That President Wil
son May Make Some Sug
gestions Much Discussed.
London, Dec. 13, 11 a. m. Although
little confidence is shown in London
that any result will come from the
peaco proposal of the Central Pow
ers and the opinion prevails quite gen-t
erally that the time is not opportune
even to discuss terms. There is an
undercurrent of feeling that some
thing would bo gained by making the
world acquainted definitely with the
objects of the belligerents. The atti
tude of the British government to
ward the offer will be made known
in the house of commons tomorrow,
provided sufficient time shall have
elapsed to permit consultation with
Great Britain's allies and this state
ment is awaited with the greatest in
terest. If the press which supports the ad
ministration correctly interprets offi
cial opinion, little time will be taken
up by consideration of tho move of
Germany and her allies, although the
moderate opinion of the country does
not favor too hasty rejection of the
overtures. It is believed the German
people onco acquainted with objects
of the entente, might be more inclined
toward peace and that, for that rea
son, if for no other, the terms of tho
entente allies should be mado known
officially to the Central Powers.
The possibility that President Wil
son will make somo suggestions when
forwarding the pffer also is much dis
cussed. It is intimated that he might
at least express willingness to convey
mo terms ot tne eniento to tne cen
tral Powers.
The report is current hero that Em
peror William is about to announce
tho granting of a parliamentary form
of government to Germany.
The joint reply of all of tho allies
will probably be available beforo the
first of the year.
Officials Withhold Comment.
The disposition this morning was to
withhold comment, inasmuch as the
actual proposals had not been received
or so for as known, transmitted to tho
British government or members of the
entente. It was expected this first
formality would be accomplished and
that there would be disclosed what
thus far has been largely a matter of
conjecture whether any specific terms
have been put forward by the Teu
tonic allies.
No Mention of Armistice.
One of the factors which, according
to an opinion expressed here, miti
gates against acceptance of tho pro
posal is that tho opening of negotia
tions would necessarily be followed
by an armistice. No specific sugges
tion of an armistice is made in the
proposal, so far as is indicated by
the unofficial reports received, but it
is said the precedent of 1866, In tho
Austro-German negotiations, estab
lished that an armistice and suspen
sion of all military activity follows
the opening of negotiations.
Times Rejects Proposal.
London, Dec. 13, 3:50 a. m. The
German peaco proposals is rejected
by the Times which says:
"Germany's proposals boar no rela
tion whatever to the objects for which
we are fighting. She has been trying
by all tho means at her disposal to
induce us to make tho suggestion of
mediation. Tho attempt has lament
ably and conspicuously failed as she
does not judge that any neutral pow
er could proffer mediation with much
advantage, she falls back on this in
direct offer to the belligerents as a
plsaller. It is above all things the
symptom of her conscious weakness.,
The allies must absolutely re
ject any idea of mediation In any
shape and from any quarter as long
as the basis proposed is the triumph
of might and not. right. They must
refuse with equal firmnesB to oven
talk about an armistice until the lands
the enemy has overrun are restored
and compensation is paid. They must
renew tho enunciation of their peace
terms, laid down once for all in Mr.
Asquith's Guild hall speech and must
redouble their efforts to force these
terms upon Germany and her accom
plices." London, Dec. 13, 12:50 p. m. The
indications arc that the various gov
ernments of tho entento allies do
not Intond to act hastily in making
joint response to tho peace proposals
of the central powers. It was pointed
out in well Informed quarters today
that while each ono of the allied gov
ernments might indicate its general
attitude, consultation among tho allies
under the treaty binding them to such
action probably would require two or
three weeks.
