GERMANY EYES ARE
SET ON AMERICA
Teutons Have Definite Ambition in
Central and South America.
Says London Post
London, Dec. 1—"The war must
be fought to a military conclusion
on the west and east fronts, with
the blockade playing only secondary
part," said Lord Robert Cecil, minis­
ter of war trade, in discussing to­
day the latest developments in the
world conflict.
"The condition of Rumania," Lord
Robert continued, "causes us grave
regret. But there is no reason to
suppose the operations there will af­
fect the result of the war, which
must be fought out on the main
fronts. The conditions under which
we will accept peace overtures re­
main the same as outlined several
months ago.
Asked concerning the origin of the
allegation in the morning post edi­
torial that Germany had offered the
entente powers generous peace
terms in return for a free hand in
Central and South America, Robert
Cecil said:
"Of course, it is well known that
Germany had very definite ambitions
in Central and South America even
before the war, but I am unaware of
any peace having- been offered us on
the terms mentioned by the morn­
ing Post. We have no knowledge
that such overtures ever had been
made here."
The London Morning Post in its
issue last Tuesday argued that the
Germans were willing for immediate
peace and would give the entente
powers everything they desired, but
only on the one condition that Ger­
many be allowed a free hand in Cen­
tral and South America.
"We understand," said the editor­
ial, "that condition has been put
forward, of course, disrreetly and
unofficially, by the German govern­
ment and that it has been rejected
by the allies."

son on Tuesday morning.

becoming to a C. E.
A new manager for the Ed. Toftey
& Co., store arrived in the home of

ing boat. Some boy, he says.
Engineer Geo. B. Hughes, County
Surveyor Berglund and Foreman
Wahlstrom left for the northern
part of the county Tuesday morning
to prepare for surveying the Gun
flint road which has been designated
as a state road. This roaa nas al­
ready been surveyed by the County
Surveyor, but before it can be made
a state road it will have to be sur­
veyed and approved by the Highway
Engineer.
Supt. of Schools Clinch has taken
up the matter of forming a Federal
Loan Association in the county for
the furthering of the farming inter­
ests of the county. He is well ver­
sed on the subject and the idea is
well worth investigating for the far­
mers who wish to further develop
their farms with money raised on
the security of their farms. The
money will be furnised at about six
percent under this plan.
Wt ARE FROM COOK COUNTY
AND PROUD OF IT
In the recent litigation in Koochi­
ching county, Attorney N. B. Arn­
old, appoited by the Governor to
make the investigation, was referred
to by the defending attorneys as the
"Gentleman from Cook county." The
same reference was correctly applied
to Engineer Hughes when he was
spoken of. The reference was of
course made in an effort to belittle
these men and what they had to say,
Cook county being commonly known
as the only county in the state with­
out railroad transportation facilities.
We have no railroad but a compari­
son of roads built in Cook county and
Koochiching county is interesting in
this connection.
Koochiching county has spent a
round half million dollars on road
construction during the past few
years, and has constructed one hun­
dred-fifty nine miles of road with
that money. The best mile of road
in that one hundred fifty-nine miles
is about equal in construction and
finish with the worst mile of road
on State roads in Cook county, or
about equal to the worst of the road
between here and Good Harbor Hill.
Their opportunity for road building
is much more favorable than ours, it
being possible to do all of the work
with graders as soon as the clearing
is clone.
The total amount spent on Cook
county roads during the past few
5'ears,
including what the separate
townships have spent on them, is a
bout $150,000.00. We have a road
from one end of the county to the
other, a road that has elicited much
favorable comment from tourists, the
total length of the road being about
eighty miles.
When we consider the road build­
ing in the two counties, we may
well hold up our heads and say, "we
are from
Cook county and we're
proud of it."
STATE BRIDGE INSPECTION
State Bridge Inspector M. J. Hof
wtn wj/ Saturday *nijrht-'s
stage and on Sunday morning inspec­
ted the bridges at Devils Track and
Cascade. He was much pleased with
the structure, the total cost per foot
being lower than any concrete bridge
erected in the State. This is very
gratifying considering that steel and
all materials are very high and labor
nearly twice as high as last season
with men scarce. The Devil's Track
bridge was erected by the County at
a much lower cost and its cost per
running foot was way below that of
any other concrete bridge erected in
the State of Minnesota, the differ­
ence in cost of erection being due
to the differences in price of mater­
ials and labor when the bridges were
erected.

POULTRY MANURE WELL
ADAPTED TO GARDENING
More Valuable Than That of Any
Other Common Farm Animal.
Excellent Fertilizer
The manure produced is a valuable
by-product of poultry raising. It is
estimated that the average night
droppings of a hen amount to 30 to
40 pounds per year. This represents
the manure which can certainly be
saved with the exercise of a little
care. A conservative estimate indi­
cates that this manure contains fer
tilizing constituents which would
cost 20 to 25 cents if bought in the
form of commercial fertilizers at or­
dinary prices. A flock of 100 hens
would at this rate produce manure
worth $20 to $25 per year. If how­
ever, the manure is not properly
cared for, as much as one-half of its
fertilizing value is likely to be lost.
To prevent loss, frequent cleaning of
the dropping boards is necessary,
and some sort of absorbent should
be used daily. The use in moderate
quantities of fine, dry loam or road
dust, or, preferably, mixtures of
these with such materials as land
plaster, acid phosphate, and potash
salts, has been recommended. Saw­
dust also has been used with good
results at the rate of 10 pounds per
iien per year mixed with 16 pounds
of acid phosphate and 8 pounds of
kainit. This gives a fertilizer which
contains about 0.25 pgp cent of• ni­
trogen, 4.5 per cent of phosphoric
acid, and 2 per cent of potash, and
is worth about $10 per ton at ordin­
ary prices of these fertilizing con­
stituents. It is a better-balanced
fertilizer than manure alone, and is
usually in better mechanical condi­
tions for applications to the soil by
means of fertilizer distributors or
manure spreaders.
With the present high price of
potash salts it' is impracticable to
use such materials in the way sug­
gested, and it may also be impracti­
cable to use acid phosphate. In this
case somewhat larger amounts of
jawdust should be used.
Sifted coal ashes may be used as
an absorbent, but wood ashes or lime
should not be mixed with the ma­
nure, as they are liable to cause the
loss of its most valuable fertilizing
constituent, namely, nitrogen, (am
nonia.) Occasionally the litter from
the poultry house may be mixed with
the manure. This increases the bulk
but greatly reduces the value per
pound of the manure and makes it
difficult to apply to the soil, except
where it is to be broadcasted and
plowed in.
Poultry manure is more valuable
than the manure of any other com­
mon farm animal.
Poultry manure is particularly
well adapted to gardening, and poul­
try raisers should either use it on
their own gardens or dispose of it
at a good price, thus increasing the
profits of their flocks.
True
"What causes all the trouble in
this world anyhow?" sighed the pes­
simist.
"People, I guess," replied the fool­
ish optimist.—Detroit Free Press.

V.
His Recommendation
A young man found it difficult to meet the
request for a recommendation when he sought
anew position in a strange city.
Finally he thought of his bank book and at
the next interview produced the same as a re­
commendation of his thrift and industry.
The novelty of the idea linked with the
continuity of deposits shown by the book, se­
cured the position for him without further in­
quiry.
Have you a recommendation of this kind
to back you, should you lose your present po­
sition? If not, get a pass book today and de­
posit your money with

STATE BANK

YEAR OF LINCOLN
We are indebted to Judge R. M.
Wanamaker, of the Supreme Court
of Ohio, for this fine idea: Let A
merican high schools teach at least
one year of Lincoln, in place of a
year of Caesar, Cicero or Vergil,
which nine high-school pupils out of
ten uselessly blunder through and
'orget within a few years.
Teaching the use of the English
language is one of the prime objects
of public-school instruction. Lin­
coln was one of the masters of En­
glish. His simple, luminous senten­
ces, which go as straight as bullets,
are models for the pupil that cannot
be improved upon.
School instruction seeks to form
and strengthen a pupil's reasoning
powers.
To follow Lincoln's mind through
his great controversies is an educa­
tion in reasoning that no classical
example surpasses. By classical ex­
amples schools seek to teach "the
humanities"—an intelligent tolerant
comprehension of one's fellow men.
In an all extant literature no man
exhibits this quality more consist­
ently and pursuasively than Lincoln.
His courage, which staked all, dared
all, and stood like rock when a great
cause was involved, yet was ever
ready to compromise, to wink at de­
linquencies, and pass by affronts in
small matters his proper ambition,
which led him to seek honorable pre­
ferment, yet never betrayed him into
mere selfishness his heroic modesty
his humor—will enrich any mind,
young or old, that studies them.
Above all, for the American, Lin­
coln incarnated American democracy.
Its technic will differ from decade to
decade. Specifically it will not seek
one object and now another but its
enduring spirit is embodied in his
life and utterances.
Schools do teach something of Lin­
coln—a vague sketch and smattering
of him. It is high time he became
a staple of American education. His
collected writings and speeches not
only contain the soul of the Ameri­
can story, but are highly worth read­
ing simply as literature—as the pic­
ture of a mind slowly evolving out
of apparent commonplace into su­
preme greatness, and so leading a
people through a great crisis.
There should be at least one year
of Lincoln in every American school.

FISH HATCHERY ON

The Duluth Branch of the Minne­
sota Game Protective League are

ver, in Lake county, erecting a small
fish hatchery for experimental pur­
poses, the building is now up and
one for the man in charge is also be­
