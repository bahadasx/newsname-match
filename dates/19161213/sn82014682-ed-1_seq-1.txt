Deretanla paving, the pros and cons
of the question which is agitating a
' large number of property ownera and
haa led to charges of "obstruction
ism," was the chief topic before the
club and was debated for an interest
ing and lively half hoar.
In an outline ' of the policy of the
flT! rard X)t supervisors. Supervisor Lo
stated that ho and .Chairman Am-
old of the road committee had dis
cussed the proposition of leaving &
strip on the thoroughfare for future
use, should the Rapid Transit Com
' pany decide to lay a double track on
'. that street . . ' . ; v
- In his discussion Logan brought out
the fact that cheapness will not serve
on a heavy traffic street Ho argued
that' the thoroughfare would always
be used as a main artery to certain
. sections of the city, and If oeovy pave
ment was not put in, In a short time
the city would have to pay a large
sum for repairs.. v: v :A'
Judge Ashford said that he was not
: an "obtructioniEtv -but he doea be
lieve that the people should refuse to
' pay for what he termed an "artillery
road," one that would more than ah
, swer the needs of the residents living
on "that street He suggested that the
frontage tax be applied to tones in
, stead of front fn?t basis.

"VVV L. Howard talked for' some
time on the laws of Hawaii, saying
that the peorle should be ashamed of
the present system of laws. He spoke
at some length on the inherited right
; of the past ages, aid the Anglo-Saxon
laws that cad been, sent" down. In
discussing the Beretanta. street pro
ject, he said that he objects to pav
. Ing if the pipes for water and gas ate
not laid before the project begins, and
he also objects t an , "artillery road"
for draylng Interests to use. ;
'Vorth Aiken of Maui, who recently
, i .rned from the mainland, told of
many incidents of his trip, and ven
tured the statement that Hawaiian mu
sic and x near-Hawaiian" music have
done much to boost for Hawaii. Aiken

Boat Clubs Will Have Year of
Grace Before Moving From
Present Locations ;
Charles R. Forbes, chairman of the
harbor commission, today ordered
work to beeln on Ihe drafting of
plans for three buildings to cover the
three new piers, 8, 9 and 10, now
under construction at. the footxf Fort
street '.' "
Forbes ordered the plans so as to
provide for contracts by units for each
piKT B9 11 IB Ul U1VCUUUU Wl vuc wvuiu .
of harbor commissioners to build the
big shed on Pier ; 8 first of all.
' The decision to build the Pier 8 shed
will be of interest to the boat clubs
as it practically means they will hot
have to seek new quarters for . at
least another year.
It was originally the intention of
the board to begin work in a short
time on Pier 2. .which .would have
driven out the boat houses, but the
purpose is now to transfer the money
on hand for this to the construction of
Pier 8. The work is slow at best and
the board feels that plana for the
-(hod should be drawn at once so as
to have things in readiness when the I

Because . it is believed that intelli

farm work go hand in hand with per
sonal and financial success in Hawaii,
and because It is felt the children of
Hawaii -should know that in Itbelr
home and school gardens they are lay

tile future,' the Star-Bulletin has an
nounced a school farm contest which
will begin January 2 and extend until
May 30, 1917. .- ..
Rules and regulations governfns the
contest have been published in pam
phlet form for distribution - among
schools, and complete details will be
published later, in the' Star-Bulletin.
Prizes will be offered for the best
results obtained by school children
both from school and home gardens,
children in all parts .of the territory

Down at the police 6tation this
morning a little storm is brewing over
certain remarks - involving the police
which were Tnade at the supervisors'
meeting last night chief among which
was the statement by Supervisor Lar
sen to the effect that the head of the
police department, was a violator of
the automobile lawa'ty' not properly
frosting his auto ;headllght$. ,
"The sheriff merely puts sapolio on
his auto globus arid this is nearly
rubbed off," said Lar6en...
This morning the sheriff was care
ful to show a reporter the exact con
dition of the globes, explaining that
they were not whitewashed, but
dipped in acid, and although one did
look a bit ragged, the sheriff insisted
that it was a good dimmer.
"Larsen hasn't any room to talk
about violating traffic laws," said
Rose, "and if everyone who drives a
car in Honolulu followed the ordi
nances as closely as I there would be
fewer accidents." ; '
M CARTHY COMPARES
DIFFERENT TAX RATES
Honolulu's tax rate is low as com
pared with that of many cities of the
mainland, according to Territorial
Treasurer Charles J, MacCarthy, who
has been looking up this detail. Den
ver is one of the cities which is lower,
having a rate of 112.73 per $1000.
Duluth, Minnesota, which assesses
on a 40 per cent basis, has a tax of
$36.30, Salt Lake on a similar basis
has $38.30. " Tacoma on a 50. per cent
basis has $40.03, and Cedar Rapids on
25 per. cent assesses at $97 a thou
sand. :;: ": . :: '''
, "Looking over this list," says the
treasurer "I am of the Opinion that
Honolulu has a pretty low rate for
taxes, and that the people about town
who are constantly objecting to the
rate, here would have but. little kick
should they look into . what other
towns are requiring. -

In discussing a proper siren or alarm

at the toard of supervisors meeting
Tuesday night Supervisor Larsen told
a tale cf the remarkable actions of a
traffic policeman in attempting to
hold up a car from the emergency hos
pital. ;
It happened that the hospital man
was on a hurry-up case at the" time,"
said Larsen, "and did not have a mo
ment to spare. Instead of clearing the
street tor the emergency vehicle and
expediting ita progress the officer
stopped or tried to stop it. The car
went n through the traffic, however,
without the officer's aid and the lat
ter. was very Indignant to think it had
not followed his direct'ons."
Larsen recommended that the am
bulance be equipped with a siren of
characteristic singularity to attract
e veryone's attention .and to allow it
the ri?ht of way wherever it might
go. He says there is such a siren on
the big car at present but avers that
