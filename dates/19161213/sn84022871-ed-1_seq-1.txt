THREE DEATHS FROM TRI
CHINOSIS IN BEAR MEAT.
Harvard University Medical Faculty
Wants Meat from Bear which
Caused Death of Father and
Daughter. Others Sick.
(Since the following was written
Mr. Heath has died.)
Last week the Monitor recorded the
death of E. A. Baldwin of Stanstead,
P. Q., of trichinosis caused by eating
rarely-cooked bear meat. This week
it is the duty of the Monitor to- record
the death of Mr. Baldwin's daughter,
Mrs. L. K. Heath of Orleans, from
the same cause. Mrs. Baldwin and
Mr Heath are both sick of the same
strange and little-known disease, but
it is expected that they may recover.
Mary Schollburg, a schoolgirl; who
lived in the Heath family at Or
leans at the time of the bear meat
enisode. is also sick. Others who ate
of the meat, both at Orleans and at
Stanstead, have experienced no troub
le and physicians say it was because
the meat was thoroughly cooked in
these instances.
To begin at the beginning of the
story we must go back to Saturday,
Oct. 28, when Geo. B. Hall of Barn
ston and E. A. Baldwin of Stan
stead, friends from boyhood, went
hunting together, as had been their
custom at about this season for many
years. Toward night a bullet from
Mr. Hall's gun brought down a bear
which was taken whole to Coaticook
and there cut up, Mr. Baldwin receiv
ing one of the hind quarters. The
meat was widely distributed and all
reports show that that which was
thoroughly cooked did no harm. Eu
gene Baldwin's two sons, Pardon and
Percy, had some of the same steak
that killed their father,but theirs was
thoroughly cooked. Another piece of
the same steak went to Orleans and
was rarely cooked and eaten with dis
tressing results as indicated in the
foregoing report. . Mrs. Heath ate
very little of the meat, in fact did not
intend to swallow any of it.
It is said that trichina spiralis is
common among rats and rabbits and
that hogs contract the disease by eat
ing rats.
So far as is known this is the only
case on record where a bear has been
the hostage of the disease. The med
ical faculty of Harvard university is
