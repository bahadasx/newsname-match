BRITAIN GIVES NO
HEED TO RUMORS
OF TEUTON PEACE
FIGHT TO FINISH
Premier Will Address Commons
"Next Tuesday Until Then
No Answer.
ENGLAND WILLING TO BATTLE
UNTIL VICTORY IS DECISIVE
Lloyd George Says Only Answer is
That Conflict Should Go to a
Knockout.
(By United Press)
London, Dec. 13.Premier Lloyd
George will address the House of
Commons next Tuesday. Until then
Great Britain will give no answer
to Germany's peace propocals. Un
til then the British are considering
continuing the war until a decisive
victory is established.
A statement made by Lloyd George
in a recent United Press interview
cited the only answer that England
sihould consider. He said, "The
fight should go to a finishto a
knockout."
People Oppose Plan.
London, Dec. 13.The British
people have already answered Ger
many's peace proposal. No, not on
such a basis, is the answer. The an
swer was perfectly apparent today.
It was reflected not only in the news
papers but in public expression on
the street. It is hardly expected that
the question will be settled with the
meeting of the House of Commons
Tuesday. Communications from the
allies can hardly be secured by that
time.
The meeting Tuesday will be
Lloyd George's first appearance be
fore the House of Commons and it
is expected that he will outline the
plans of the new cabinet.
Germany's peace proposals as
given out are generally regarded as
preposterous and nor worthy of ser
ious consideration.

PREVIOUS RECORDS AT DULUTH
Duluth, Minn., Dec. 13.The

season has been reached and passed.
The total shipments of ore during
the navigation season of 1916 which

mately 65,188,648 tons*. It is not
expected that a revision of figures
when the rush is over will show much
change from that total.
The total shipments of iron ore
last season amounted to 43,781,243
ton.
This season not only beats all for
mer records, but is so far ahead that
tome declare that it will be years be
fore it is equalled.
ROLE OF UNITED STATES IN
PEACE NOT DETERMINED
Washington, Dec. 13.What part
the United States will play in fur
thering Germany's peace suggestions
has not been determined. Officials
think this government should only
act as a messenger. The situation
must be handled carefully.
President Wilson will not drop
any hint as* to his plans but says
that will wait for further devel
opments. He has not discussed his
plan with his cabinet.
