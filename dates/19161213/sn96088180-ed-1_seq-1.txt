That answer m perfectly ap

only la the newtaper comment, but
In expressions from the people on

Lloyd-George neat Tuesday to frame
thle anawer. It cannot be a direct
reply, alnce M la hardly expected Eng
land's oonaultatlon with her allies

Oeorge's first abearance aa premier
before the home of commons and be
fore newa of the German proposal
came he had been announced as
ready, to outline on that date the
alms and purposes of the new cab
inet. Press and public alike look to
Lloyd-George on this occasion to
voice the nation's rejection of any
peace which Is oased on Germany's
Idea of her victory.
' Germany's peers views, as given
out by a Gorman embassy official In
Washington, were generally regard
ed aa preposterous and unworthy of
acrlous consideration here. I.loyd
George's telegram to Premier Hrlsncl
of Trance, together with the former's
recent Interview granted the United
Press, portions of which were liber
ally reproduced In the British press
today, were considered Indicative or
nrltaln's altitude toward von Beth-maun-lHollweg's
terms.
The only keynote, of difference ob
servable In editorial comment today
waa whether the allies, In their re
ply to the German note should set
' fortht herein their own terms upon
which peace discussion would be con
sidered. If the practical unanimity
of opinion means anything, the re
ply will oo rejsotsd. Press comment
ranged today til the way. from the
Dally Mall's suggestion that ton
. Bethmana-Hollweg Is "no 'mora en-
, titled to tha courtesy of a reply than
named burglar In a private house,"
' to that made by the - Manchester
Ouardian, .that negotiations should

That tCngland and her allies should

Is that at present the United States

Furthermore, they aay frankly they

basis upon which the entente powers
are willing to enter upon peace nego-
j tlaUoaa, wore. ascertained this after-
noon from various sources by the
United Press. Ons of the provisions
would be for full Indemnity by Get
many for devaatlon to the nations
which she has fnvaded.
These terms, although unofBcUl,
! re believed to represent the c .nces
isions which Germany must make to
obtain peace. They are as foros
