WASHINGTON, Dec. 13. Gor
nianjr'i proposal for peace Is regarded
here as having broken the chains
which for months have retrained
the United Slates, ait well an other
neutrals, from making offers of medi
ation. Now that one (set of belligerents
has signified Its wllllngnens to dis
cuss peace terms a condition often
reiterated as necessary to any action
by President Wilson there are Indi
cations that when the United States,
acting as the Intermediary, transmits
the German proposal, it may accom
pany Its action by soma steps to
throw the influence of the United
States Into the balance for at leant a
consideration, however preliminary,
of the terms upon which a lasting
peace might be brought to the world.

nations, such as President Wilson
has suggested, must be the outcome,
and it could not be perfected without
the participation of the United States.
Whether the United States will
transmit the German proposal with
out any comment whatever, or accom
pany It with some formal or Informal
expression, will not be decided until
the note delivered to American
Charge- Grew In Berlin reaches Presi
dent Wilson's hands, probably to
morrow. There were Indications that Presi
dent Wilson might find some way to
express the Bolemn and earnest wish
of the United States for a careful
consideration of the suggestion of
peace, even before the entente gov
ernments have made known their at
titude towards the German proposal.
This, it was pointed out, would neces
sarily be done In such a deliberate
and ultra-confldontlal way that it
would never be known publicly should
the allies decline the offer. This
course was said to be absolutely
necessary so as to leave the United
States free and unembarrassed to act
when an acceptlble peace offer comes.
regardless whether President Wil
son decides to accept the German
propusal, with any word, it was said
he questionably would take steps to
learn the attitude of the entente al
lies toward the peace move and
possibly might send to Europe his
personal friend and adviser. Colonel

Recent dispatches to the German

general terms for peace might be In
substance as follows:
A restoration of the status quo ex
isting before the war. This Includes
the evacuation of Belgium and the
occupied portions of northern France,
with the exception of Alsace and Lor
raine. No authorized expression was
obtainable from the embassy aa to
whether conditions would be attached
to the restoration of Belgium and
French territory, but It was under
stood that the German Idea was to
make provision for the future neu

The report is current that the em

Diplomats of the entente allies
regard the late peace offer as having
the double purpose of placing upon
the allies the responsibility for con
tinuing the war and of impressing
upon the German people that they
are . fighting a' defensive conflict
against enemies, who refuse quarter.
Coming immediately after the cul

tended to convince people that the
government is not responsible for
sacrifices and that their adversaries
alone are responsible for a continua

neutrals that the allies are pursuing
a policy of ambition. That ia an ex
