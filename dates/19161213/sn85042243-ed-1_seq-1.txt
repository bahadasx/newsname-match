favor of themselves and had voted
their payment that they had violat­

than the statutes provide, Governor
L. B. Hanna thl9 morning removed
from office Chairman William Col
grove and Commissioners John "A.
Rieger and Paul,.F. Schmidt of the
Hettinger county, board.
The governor's1 decision is a victory
for State's Attorney H. V. Crane in a
battle of long standing.which has split
Hettinger county wide open. The
trouble started when Crane asked the
county commission for a contingent
fund with which to clean up the coun­
ty, morally. The board turned the
state's attorney down cold, and since
that date Crane has been camping on
the commissioners' trail. Sentiment
in Hettinger county is said to have
•been about equally divided in the con­
troversy.
Order* Served Tomorrow.
Governor Hanna directed copies of
his order to State's' Attorney Crane
this afternoon, and' it is expected that
ouster writs will be served on the
county commissioners tomorrow. On
two of their number—Colgrove and
Rieger—the removal will have the ef­
fect of depriving them of two weeks'

"The goveftior finds that tile charg­
es are sustaintffi'ih the following par­
ticulars, to-wji'f1',
"That it is shown by the testimony
that the stale's attorney of Hettinger
county, under he law, had asked cer­
tain moneys should be set aside for
the purpose: pf: creating a state's at­
torney's contingent, fund. The statute
says that where a request of this kind
is made by the state's attorney, they
have the power to do this-, and further
that they are directed to d9 so. In my
judgment, up to the amount of $100,
this is mandatory. Further, it is
shown that an application was made
to said board of county commissioners
for the creation of such state's attor­
ney's contingent fund, by the state's
attorney, and their attention had also
been called to the law requiring the
same to be created.
Further, it is shown by the testi­
mony that the defendants, while act­
ing as county commissioners of Het­
tinger county, went on with the build­
ing of bridge* and-the doing of road
work where the amounts involved
were in excess of $J00 without adver­
tising, as rdquii^d by the statutes of
the state further that the defendants
purchased road gradera and road ma­
chinery where the amounts involved
weer in excess of $10.00 without ad­
vertising for bids, although the law
specifically states that purchases to

Presented, Claims.
"It is furthe# disclosed by"the record
'that the county surveyor of Hettinger
county presented claims against the
county and received and was allowed
by the defendants as county commis
sioners a.sum greater for his services
as county surveyor than is provided
by law.
"It appears further from the testi­
mony that the respondents performed
labor and charged up time against the
county when not acting in their offi­
cial capacity as county commissioners
and for such time presented to the
county bills and received payment
from such county at the rate of $5 per
day in disregard of the statute where
such charge can be made only where
services are performed in their official
capacity as county commissioners.
"The record disclosed further that
for time spent in looking after the
poor in the county under the statute
a charge against the county was made
which was allowed and paid at the
rate of $5 the day, whereas the statute
fixes a limit of $2 per day for such ser­
vices on the part of the county com
missioners.
"In matters and things above-men­
tioned and referred to the governor
finds that the charges of misconduct
in office on account of such matters
against the defendants in this pro­
ceeding are sustained.

governor of the state of North Dakota,
by virtue of the authority vested in
^me by the laws of such state, do here­
by remove the said John A. Rieger,

IT GIVES PACKERS
VIRTUAL MONOPOLY
Producers Place All Their Troub­
les at Door of Controlled
Market
Chicago, Dec. 13.—Up until the time
a beef is delivered ftver to the rail­
road company to be shipped to the
commission man, who acts as selling
agent for,.the producer with the pack­
ers, it has a comparatively simple
life history.. If it is a typical animal
it was born on a big range, grazed
upon the vast reaches of the plains
and was finally sold to the breeder
through a commission man to a feeder
who "fei it up" for the market.
More Complicated
But Immediately the animal leaves
the feeder, Its annals become more
comlicated and the various economic
forces which are exerted upon it until
it reaches your table are more clouded
in mystery, more swath,ed about with
long, clinging terms such as "supply
and demand," and "market excess and
such cloaks of concealment which big
business bundles about its operation,
whether consciously or unconsciously.
For the moment the beef arrives at
one of the big live stock markets, the
influence of the packers begins to be
felt upon all concerned in this beef's
disposal.
The beef under discussion is now
in the hands of the commission man
who is going to sell it for the feeder
to. the packer who wishes to slaughter
and dress it for the* retail market.
The commission man therefore is, to
all intents arid purposes, not greatly
more than a small object between two
millstones, as the live* stock business
is cbiiducted today in America. He
must please his client, the producer,
insofar as he is able, blithe must also
make terms with th/e packer if he is
tdkeil.
The. lower miUstonA in this crucial
transaction in the history of the evolv­
ing of a beefsteak may be represented
as "desire of the producers." The
upper millstone is "the will of the
packers." Let us first see how the
producers outline tljeir desires as re­
gards the selling of their product, and
how nearly they cqpe.to making, this
deBlre operative, and What they think
of the results. Then we will be ready
to look at "the will of the packers"
in this great bom£ of selling and buy­
ing the meat for nations!
In the first place the producers, as
we have shown, declare they are being
so underpaid for their animals that
their losses are becoming alarming
and loss of confidence is resulting in
their either cutting down their scale
of production greatly or, in some
cases, going out of the business en­
tirely. That their product does not
bring the figures it should, although,
the retail price of meat is rising so
greatly, is due, they vociferously
charge, to a live stock market in prac­
tically absolute control of the packers,
the famous Chicago five who largely
dispense the meat of this country.
They cite, with vehemence, the fact
that as against their alleged losses,
the packers last year made the largest
profits in their history!
Their first charge, in *hat they al­
lege to be evidence of this controlled
and manipulated market by the-pack­
ers, is that the leading packers really
constitute a trust that, while on the
surface they appear to be independ­
ent, they, in.reality, work in harmony
so far as buying is concerned.
Entire Market
Since they constitute practically the
entire market of the United States so
far as the commercial producer of cat­
tle is geerally concerned, this fact, if
true—namely that they buy "in har­
mony"—would riiake it quite possible
for them to shove the market up or
down practically as they see fit. By
all buying lightly, for instance, es­
pecially in the face of large receipts
of cattle (which, as.has been explain­
ed, inust be sold at once) they could
put the commission men in a panic and
reduce the current quotations con
sederably if, indeed, of course, they
indulge in "organized buying."
That the producers believe this
manipulation of market to be true is
evidenced by the fact resolutions by
various other state groups of pro­
ducers the national live stock inter­
ests submitted in support of their
charges of packer control of the live
stock markets, exhibiting what sort of
a regime they wish together with an
outline of the situation as they see
it. This is summed up in the resolu­
tion passed by the great blanket or­
ganization of the cattlemen, the Amer­
ican National Live Stock association.
This resolution says:
"Whereas, the big meat packers of
the United States are largely in con­
trol of stock yards, and the terminal
facilities thereat of the slaughter and
distribution of cattle, sheep, hogs and
poultry, and the products thereof, in­
cluding hides of tanneries and the
products therefrom of many of the
articles made from horns and hoofs,
including glue, buttons, combs, etc.
of cottonseed oil mills and refineries,
the products of which are used in the
manufacture of lard compounds, soap,
and various oleo products and
"Whereas, they also largely control

London, Dec. 13.—'Premier Lloyd

Britain will give no answer to Ger­

are considering but one thing: to con­

Recent statements of Lloyd-George
are being cited as England's answer.
Upon several occasions, the new pre­
mier has said:
"The fight will go to a finish to a

Don't Want Peace.
The British people already have
answered Germany's peace proposals.
They do not want peace on such a
basis. The answer is perfectly" ap­
parent today. It is reflected in news­
papers and in public expressions on
the street. It is hardly expected that
the question will be settled with the
meeting of the house of commons,
Thursday. It would be impossible to
get into communication with all the
Allies by that time.
Lloyd-George is to make his first
appearance as premier at that time
^and will then outline his new cabinet

Germany's peace proposals as given
out by German embassy officials gen­
erally are regarded as preposterous
and unworthy of consideration here

If the Entente Rejects it TheiJ
Struggle Will Be Continued
To Bitter End

Berlin, Dec. 13.—Germany didi not
ask the neutral powers to start peace
negotiations. The American embassy
here merely understands that the
Teutons asked neutrals to inform the
Entertte Powers that the Central Pow­
ers were ready to discuss peace, put­
ting it up to the Allies to refuse ot,
accept.

Diplomatic corps here consider Ger­
many's move a master stroke. Seo*
retary Crew of the American embaa*
sy personally typed the transaction
note, of which he received two cop*
ies. He was asked to send copies to
Petrograd, to London and to Ruma*
nia. The' Spanish minister was re*
quested to convey the note to Bel­
gium and Portugal, and Switzerland
was asked to convey the message to
Italy.
If German's peace offers are reject*
ed by the Entente Powers, it is cer­
tain that the Central Powers will not
make another overture to end the war.
The German public and press voiced
its approval of the Imperial Chancel­
lor's solemn warning in the Reich­
stag that if the Entente Powers con­
tinue the war it will be because they
have conquest in mind. Such belief
fired the public to a determination to
battle to the bitter end.
Following is the text of the note ad«
dressed by Germany and. her allies to
the hostile governments as read late
yesterday by the chancellor before tbe
reichstag:
••Tfofc nfost 'tefrifid «ckMfi
eneed'in history ha* been rafting (or
the last two years and a half over'a
large part of the world—a catastrophe
which thousands of years of common
civilization was unable to precent and
which injures the most precious
achievements of humanity.
"Our aims are not to shatter nor
annihilate our adversaries. In spite
of our consciousness of our military
and economic strength and our readi*
nesS to continue the war (which had
been forced upon us), until the bitter
end if necessary, at the same time,
prompted by the desire to avpid far­
ther bloodshed and make an end to
the atrocities of war, the four allied
powers propose to enter forthwith in*
to peace negotiations.
Guarantee of Existence.
"The propositions which they brine
forward for such negotiations and
which have for their-object a guar­
antee of the existence of the honor
and liberty of evolution for their na­
tions are, according to their firm be­
lief, an appropriate basis for the es­
tablishment of a lasting peace.
"The four allied powers have been
obliged to take up arms to defend
justice and the liberty, of national
evolution. The glorious deeds of our
armies have in no way altered their
purposes. We also maintained the
firm belief that our own rights and
justified claims in no way control the
rights of these nations.
"The spiritual and material prog­
ress which wfere the pride of Europe
at the beginning of the twentieth cen­
tury are threatened with ruin. Ger­
many and her allies, Austria-Hungary,
Bulgaria and Turkey, gave proof of
their unconquerable strength in this
struggle. They gained gigantic ad­
vantages over adversaries superior in
number and war material. Our lines
stand unshaken against ever-repeated
attempts made by armies.
The last attack in the Balkans has
been rapidly and most victoriously
overcome. The most recent demon­
strations have shown that further con­
tinuation of the war will not result
in breaking the resistance of our
forces and the whole situation with
regard to our troops justifies our ex­
pectation of further successes.
Offer of Peace.
"If, in spite of this offer of peace
and reconciliation, the struggle should
go on, the four allied powers are re­
solved to continue to a victorious end
but they disclaim responsibility for
this before humanity and history. The

good offices of your excellency, ask
