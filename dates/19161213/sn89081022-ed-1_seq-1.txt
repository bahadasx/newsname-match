FOR GOOD CATTLE
Two Brainerd Men Buy 31 Pure
breds For Shipment to
Grow Wing County.
Thrty-one head of purebred cattle
were purchased in this county last
week for shipment to farms in Crow
Wing county, near Brainerd. Messrs.
H. C. Zierke. a cattle buyer and ship
per, and Byron Gates, a progressive
fanner living near Brainerd, were the
buyers. They purchased twelve pure
bred sires, six head of purebred cows
and a number of high grade cows.
The breeds represented .w'ere Here
fords, Red Polls and Shorthorns. The
supply available for sale in the coun
ty is very limited. The demand for
purebred cattle is away beyond the
supply. Our informant says that $80
to $&0 per head were offered for pure
bred young stock and refused by the
owners. "Then," said he, "why will
people persist in breeding scrubs,
which they must keep three or four
years in order to realize this price,
and are lucky if they get it at any
time."
Mr. Byron Gates, mentioned above,
is a son of Joshua Gates, pioneer
schoolmaster of this county, and who
lived on the north shore of Diamond
Lake in the early days. Mr. Byron
Gates bought a bull from Mr. C. O.
Bergquist three weeks ago, and this
animal was included in the shipment
made to Brainerd this week. Mr.
Bergquist has sold all his holdings of

COMMUNITY MOURNS
A GOOD WOMAN
Unexpected Death of Mrs. Os
car Knirison Shocks All.
A Large Funeral.
MRS. OSCAR A. KNUTSON.
Mrs. Oscar A. Knutson, beloved wo
man in the home and social circles in
the south part of the county, passed
away last Wednesday afternoon, suc
cumbing to an attack of pneumonia
and complications. Mrs. Knutson has
been in poor health for a number of
years back but seemed during the
past year to be getting stronger, and
her many friends had good hopes that
she would reg^'n her health and be
come robust agj in. It was not so to
be. She was taken down on Sunday,
Dec. 3, with the fatal malady that
caused her death after three days.
She attained the age of thirty years,
one month and sixteen days.
Mrs. Marie Elsie (Peterson) Knut
son was born at Lake Lillian Oct. 20,
1886. She was baptized as a member
in the Christine Lutheran church at
Lake Lillian and was confirmed at
Willmar at the age of sixteen by Rev.
Gustaf Peterson. She grew to woman
hood in the community, and became
the bride of Mr. Oscar A. Knutson,
Dec. 23, 1905. Eleven years of happy
married life came to a close with her
death, and the grief-stricken husband
with three children,—Marvel, Ralph
and Olive, aged 10, 7 and 5 years re
spectively are left to bitterly mourn
The late Mrs. Oscar Knutson.
their beloved wife and mother. She
is also mourned by her parents, Mr.
and Mrs. H. P. Peterson of Lake Lil
lian, and three brothers and four sis
ters—Anton, Albert and Emil Peter
son, Mrs. Minnie Linn, Mrs. Selma
Johnson, Mrs. Ella Lundquist and
Miss Hazel, all of whom were present
at the funeral. Among the mourners
are also Mr. and Mrs. Erick Knutson,
Victor S. Knutson of Long Prairie,
and many other relatives.
Her life was gentle, quiet and unas
suming, but like the still waters it
was deep. In her heait of hearts she
carried those she loved, and her hand
was never weary, her step never fail
ed in ministering unto, caring for,
waiting upon those who were in any
way dependent upon her.
The funeral services were held Sun
day morning, and the outpouring of
the people who came to pay their last
respects to the memory of one who
was beloved by all testified to her
standing in the community. The cor
tege which left the late residence at
ten o'clock extended for a mile and
a half, and some one. has told us that
he counted ninety-eight autos which
brought the people to the Svea
church.
Rev. W. E. Pearson of Willmar of
ficiated. He preached the funeral ser
mon, and Rev. E. O. Erickson of the
Fahlun Baptist church also gave a
tribute to the deceased woman in a
brief address. A quartette composed
of Miss Ellen and Mr. Walter Skog
lund, Mrs. Harold Nelson and Mr.
Harry Johnson, sang two selections
and Mr. Samuel Nelson of Willmar
gave a solo. It was one of the sad
dest funerals seen at Svea and the
church was unable to room the peo
ple.
The pall bearers were the three bro
thers—Albert, Arthur and Emil, and
three brothers-in-law, Chas. Johnson,
Oscar Linn and Victor Lundquist, and
the interment took place in the
churchyard adjoining.
Ther.3 was a profusion of flowers
from, relatives and friends. There
was a broken wheel from the neigh
bors, a wreath from the Ladies' Aid
Society of the Christine church, and
a bouquet from the M. W. A. of Will
mar.
Among those from a distance in at
tendance at the funeral were Supt. V.
S. Knutson of Long Prairie, Mrs. Jo
seph Magnuson and baby of Cromwell,
Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert Heglund and
Mrs. David Gustafson of Olivia and a
large number from Willmar, including
Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Nelson and famify,
Mr. and Mrs. Chas. Johnson.and fam
ily, F. G. Handy, Mr. and Mrs. Nels

The whole community knew her as
Elsie., To us who knew her better
VOLUME 22. 12 PAGES WILLMAR, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1916 PRICE 5 CENTS
and closer the qualities that made
friends and neighbors call her Elsie
made an impression on our souls that
will sweeten with the years and will
grow deeper with the passing of time.
Though a sufferer as few have suf
fered for six long years, the smile
never left her face and the hope never
faded from her eye. "Laugh and the
world laughs with you," sings the poet
and the words are true but how she
misses it when she added, "Weep and
you weep alone." No! ah no! The
golden chain which links heart to
heart and soul to soul stretches from
the springs of laughter to the foun
tain of tears.
Where Dickens laughed we laugh!
Where the tears blotted the page up
on which he wrote, yours blur the
page as you read. So today Elsie's
folks need not feel lonely. All who
knew her are weeping. No unkind
words from her lips are left to mar
the memories of her life. .**•-•
If she had any unkind thoughts of
anyone she carried them with her in
to the silence of the grave. The new
ly born babe could leave no cleaner or
better record than this.
So I, who am nothing more than a
tenant by sufferance in the realm
where I stumbled because of relent
less circumstances and where I claim
no title to a foot of earth—come in
all humility and sorrow to put a wild
flower upon her grave.
She loved the birds—may they sing
sweetly where she rests. She loved
the trees and flowers—may the leaves
whisper while she sleeps and flowers
bloom above her couch.
She loved us all. May our hearts
be more tender and noble because she
lived, may our eyes be wet with tears
because she died.—A Friend.
O I A
P. M. QUIST.
Tomorrow afternoon at Willmar
will occur the funeral of P. M. Quist,
formerly an old time resident of Will

ability as a penman. He studied law.v
Was admitted'to the bar and hung
out his shingle where the Farmers'
restaurant is now located. He was
appointed county attorney in place of
Scot Ransom in 1883 and was re-elect
ed for another term. He held the of

MASS MEETING ON
LEGISLATIVE ISSUES
P. H. Frye'i
Session With Constituents
at the Coartltoise.
About fifty citizens in the county re
sponded to the call of Representative
Frye, and appeared at the courthouse
last Saturday afternoon to discuss leg
islative matters. Supt. G. A. Foster,
of the city schools, was elected chair
man of. the meeting and Peter Bonde,
secretary. Representative P. H. Frye
was present, but Senator P. A. Gand
rud was absent.
The deficiency in the school appro
priations was the matter first brought
up. Representatives of the Boards of
Education of Willmar and Atwater
spoke urging that the state aid prom
ised the schools should be provided
for in full and that the deficiencies of
the past two years be made good.
Members of country schools present
expressed themselves along the same
lines and a resolution was adopted
asking pur legislators to support these
appropriations. There were interest
ing side discussions on the school
laws by several present, and for a
time it looked as though the meeting
would go on record as favoring that
the state laws should prescribe all the
conditiona for granting state aid to
schools, and less discretion be grant
ed the State Boad. The bubbling
fountains in country schools, exces
sive requirements for library books,
etc., was denounced as graft.
Representative Frye went into de
tail on his record relating to the
school appropriations in the last ses
sion, showing how he had stood by the
"little red school house" appropria
tions consistently from start to finish.
Representative Christianson was
the only candidate for Speaker for the
next session who had fought for ade
quate school appropriations in the last
session, said Mr. Frye.
The road laws and drainage laws
were discussed pro and con. A mo
tion that the meeting favored a return
to the township system of caring for
all roads was voted down. As to
drainage it was admitted that pro
gress had been made at the last ses
^n^i^t^/iteh* direction, by. the pro
vision ci~Srainage districts, by which
all who tile into an outlet can be tax
ed to contribute towards improving
the main ditches. The matter of se
curing- a State appropriation for as
sisting in cleaning up the South Fork
of Crow River was discussed, but lit
tle faith was shown that such assist
ance can be secured.
The last matter to be taken up was
the fish laws. A resolution was adop
ted asking for laws prohibiting the li
censing by the State to seine our
lakes for "rough" fish. Also for per
mitting netting for home use with set
nets with mesh not less than two and
a half inches square.
The meeting came to a close as the
shadows of the early December eve
ning began to be noticeable in the
courtroom. Mr. Frye had asked for
advice, and he was given a lot of it.
He will continue in the next session
to use his own sound judgment, as he
did in the last. The meeting did no
harm, and it no doubt was a relief to
many to unburden their minds.

NINE DAYS FOR SHOP
PERS BEFORE X-MAS
Willmar Stores Are the Mecca
For Christmas Shoppers
FromFar and Hear.
Three days this week and six solid
days next week remain for Christmas
shoppers before Christmas eve. The
latter coming on Sunday disposes of
the problem of how late to keep the
stores open on that day. Saturday
evening of next week will be the last
chance to buy your Christmas goods.
The Willmar stores are brimful of
attractive goods for Christmas buy
ers. The cold wave will soon moder
ate and as there has not been enough
snow to impede auto driving shoppers
can easily come in long distances ov
er the good roads.
Our clothing stores are presenting
unprecedented opportunities to buy
winter clothing at low prices, and buy
ers are running in from great distanc
es to take advantage of them.
Revelers Reorganize.
"The Revelers," the local social or
ganization which held a series of de
lightful dancing parties last year,
have reorganized for the present sea
son. A preliminary meeting was held
last Saturday evening. Dr. H. E. Can
field was re-elected president and Dr.
A. w. Odell was chosen secretary. It
is planned to have the first dance on
the evening of Friday, Dec. 29, and
they will be held semi-monthly there
after.
The Synod Mission Society.
The annual meeting of the Mission
Society of the Synod church was held
Tuesday afternoon. The reports were
read and approved. New officers elect
ed were Mrs. J. H. Olsen as president
and Mrs. N. Stromseth as secretary

of years but refused a re-election was
given a vote of thanks.

C0MMEND8 BAN ON DANCING
Baptist Minister Denounces Dancing
and Praises Board ef Education.
In his sermon Sunday evening last,
Rev. Hallin of the Baptist church,
speaking from the text: "John the
Baptist Beheaded," denounced danc
ing in strong terms, showing that no
other enjoyment has led so many
young men and young women to ruin
as dancing. The Willmar Board of
Education was highly praised for its
resolution, putting a ban on dam»fac
in connection with the High School.
May Have Club House.
At a meeting of the Automobile
Club held last Wednesday evening,
preliminary plans' for the purchase of
ground for the erection of a club
house, were talked over. The plan is
to take up a subscription among auto
enthusiasts, selling shares at 125.00
per share. The question of a location
is indefinite but it will be at either
Eagle or Green Lake.
A committee of five, was appoint
ed to report at the next meeting,
which will be held in the near future.
Loney Block Improvement.
J. R. Loney informs the Willmar
Tribune that he has let the contract
for remodeling the store rooms about
to be vacated by the New York store.
Two plate fronts with prismatic glass
will be put in, the floors tiled, and no
expense be spared to make the store
rooms second to none in the city. Mr.
Loney has faith in Willmar and is
willing to put up good money to make
his fine locations the best in appoint
ments.
Tobacco Dealers Arrested.
Several of the local confectionery
stores had evidently become lax in ob
serving the law prohibiting the sale
of cigarettes and tobacco to minors
and accordingly the sheriff got busy
last week and made ten arrests. Eight
plead guilty of the charge and paid
their fines each of 14 and costs. A
ninth stood trial and was found guilty
and was fined $4 and costs. A tenth
case is pending.
