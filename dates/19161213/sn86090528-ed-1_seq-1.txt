SETTLEMENT NEEDS
A WORLD GUARANTEE
U. S. Will Not Be Stampeded Into Any
Peace Move But Thinks Allies
Should Discuss Offer
By United Press.
Washington, Doc. 13. What part
the United States will play la further
ing the German peace suggestion has
not been determined but it is known
that these three big ideas relative to
it are uppermost in the mind of offi
cialdom here:
That any settlement should be back
ed by a world guaranty of peace.
That England and her allies should
at least discuss the offer.
That the United States will not be
sampeded into any peace move.
On the whole the 'ment here is
that the United States ought me.ely to
act as messenger for Germany to pass
her proposals to her enemies.
President Wilson has not decided
the course to be pursued and has not
even told his cabinet what he thinks
about it. - Col. E.' li Houso, the presi
dent's adviBer and traveling private
envoy, conferred with him today.
It is believed here that England will
reject the German offer, especially if
it is based upon the terms announced
by the German embassy official here
but officials attach great importance
to the fact that the proposal forms the
entering, wedge for peace or parleys.
It is pointed out that the Teutonic of
fer furnishes good food for thought
and officially starts the ball rolling
even though it may apparently fail for
the moment.
Neutrals Mere Messengers.
By United Press.
Berlin, Dec. 13. Germany has not
asked neutral powers to start peace
negotiations. The understanding by
the embassy here is that she has mere
ly asked neutral powers to inform the
entente capitals that the central pow
ers are willing to discuss peace, put
ting up to the allies acquiescence or
refusal of the tender. y

peace proposals made by Chancellor

American Press View.
By United Press.
New York, Dec. 13. The bulk of the
editorial opinion of American newspa
pers is that peace has been brought
noarer by many things but the general
view expressed is that the allies will
not accept the Teutonic proposals.
Public Says "No."
By United Press.
London, Dec. 13. The British peo
ple have already answered Germany's
peace offer with "No, not on such a
basis as is proposed." That aiswer is
apparent. It Is reflected not only by
the press but also in the expressions
of people on the Btreets.
The nation looks to Lloyd-George
next Tuesday to frame an answer be
fore parliament. The proposed peace
terms generally are regarded as pre
posterous and unworthy of serious
consideration. The only keynote of
difference observable in the press
comment is whether the reply of the
allies should set forth their own terms.
Public opinion and the press both say
the offer of thp Central powers should
be rejected.
Press comment ranged from the
Daily Mail's suggestion that Chancel

ONE WAY TO BEAT THE
HIGH COST OF LIVING
By United Press.
Chicago, Dec. 13. "Raise
chickens in your back yard If
you would cut the high cost of
living," said Theodore Hewes,
secretary of the Poultry Show
which opened here today.
"The increase in the price of
dressed poultry has not. yet
equalled that of pork or beef
and it is a commodity that can
be produced at home," he add
ed. "A few fowls in the back
yard, fed largely from the
waste from your table, not only
produces delicious meat, but
supplies fresh eggs, a luxury
which few can afford when
they must buy them."
At the meeting of the Grady County
Good Reads association at the city
all I-"- ::."ht, the special committee
; ".pointed for the purpose made plans
for circulating the petitions requesting
the county commissioners to call an
election for voting on a $1,000,000 bond
issue for bridges and hard surface
roads. Dr. R. J. Gordon, of Ninnekah,
president of the association, met with
the committee composed of J. E.
Schow, of this city, Henry Mileur and
Barker Riddle, of Rush Springs.
"We have practically completed all
arrangements for circulating the peti
tions throughout the county except at
Alex, Bradley and Middleburg," said
Mr. Mileur. "We would like to have
some good volunteers to work in those
sections of the county. Copies of the
petition may be obtained from Mr.
Schow."
The committee also considered at
some length the location of the pro
posed highways, the object being to
utilize postroads as far as possible
with a view to getting government
aid.
It is planned hold a big meeting in
Chickasha when the necessary num
ber of signatures have been obtained
and at that time speakers will discuss
all phases of the proposition.
by law yesterday afternoon at the
Commercial and Farm bureau office.
One of the plans for the fair asso
ciation for te coming year is to set
the date early in order to permit early
arrangements to be made for advertis
ing and to get good carnival attrac
tions. These should be negotiated for
eight or ton mouths in advance and
the secretary has been instructed to
communicate with such attractions as
the DeKreko brothers and Patterson
Great Shows looking to a whole week's
entertainment. The securing of a
good carnival last year was made im-
j possible by . the short time in which
arrangements could be made. A car
nival approaching those at state fairs
will be the aim for 1917.
The date of the next Grady County
Free fair will be set at the state meet
ing of the county fair associations
which will be held at Lawton on De
cember 21 and 22. It was decided that
tho president and secretary of the Gra
dy county association and County
Agent O. C. Cooper should atttend the
meeting.
The finances of the association were
found to bo in good shape considering
the extent of the appropriation with
which this fair was launched, there
hc'r.g a balance of $7.02 in the treas
ury. 'We expect to make the 1917 free
fair the best in the history of Grady
countyl," declared J. W. Kayser, a
member of the executive board, this
morning and fo rthat reason we are
asking for next year an appropriation
of $3,000 or $3,500. Actual work kill
commence much earlier than was the
case last year."
The following members were pres
ent at the. meeting:
W. E. Smith, I president; Arthur
Ersland, secretary; O. C. Cooper, coun
ty agent; Dr. It. J. Gordon, Ninnekah,

The sale of Shorthorn stock at the

of the thirty-three guests who sat
down to the spread at tho Geronimo
last night.
It was an intellectual as well as an
inner man feast and wit and humor
and entire satisfaction with an amplo
and good meu'i were the predominant
features.
The addresses were all of a high or
der being on various phases of "The
Spirit of Sociability." There was not
a dull moment throughout the evoning.
A surprise stunt which engendered
much merriment was sprung on his
fellow guests by the toastmaster. Rev
L. L. Cohen. F. E. Riddle bore the
brunt of what appeared ou the sur
face to be a practical Joke but which
resulted in a bit of interesting and
profitable entertainment,

tlzing'course Mr. Riddle was called on
to rise. After being allowed to stand
for a few seconds at a loss to know
what was to follow, the toastmaster
saked him his name. It was given.
Then his business and place of busi
ness or profession was asked and care
fully mentally noted. In this manner
all present answered to the roll call
which served the purpose of a general
introduction. The quiz, however, elic
ited some witty rasponses. When
asked his business Thomas H. Dwyer,
president of the Chickasha National
bank, replied that he was a barber,
that his business was shaving notes.
C. B. Turner, next in turn, said ho was
an apprentice barber learning the
trade from Mr. Dwyer and Williatn if.
Donahue.
On "The Spirit of Sociability,"
Toastmaster Cohen had plenty to say
and it was all good to hear.
The speakers who followed made
splendid responses to their various
toasts which were as follows:
Thomas H. Dwyer on "The Spirit of
Sociability in Business."
County Superintendent M. II. Shep-
ard: "The Spirit of Sociability in
Civic Affairs."
Rev. Byron Hester: "Tho Spirit of
Sociability in Religion."
Last night's affair was regarded as
one of the best three meetings which
the Men's Dinner club has held. The
next dinner will bo given about the
middle of January.
Under the re-organization plan fifty
seven members had already enrolled
last night. The announcement on
Monday that fifty members had al
ready enrolled led some who had in
tended to attend the banquet to be
lieve that that number of plates had
been spoken for, the limit, and there
fore did not attend.

Mr. Barry when seen this morning
said:
"The affair was most deplorable and
had my car been moving at any rale
of speed the boy would doubtless have
been killed. That he was not more
badly hurt was due to the high bicyclo
which he rode, I had practically
brought the car to a stop to allow an
other aiV.otnobilo to enter the Burton
garage and a full stop was probably
made before the instant of compact as
the boy's wheel was not even under
the car when I removed it later. Ex
cept for that he would have been
killed."
Mr. Barry explained that he had re
turned from Lawton at 5:40 o'clock
and after reaching home, accompanied
by his son, he was taking the Stude
baker to the garage for repairs to the
feed valve which would not work. He
was proceeding cautiously east on
Kansas avenue at a rate not exceed
ing five miles an hour, feeding the
aachino by hand, with a lifted hood,
his son guiding the car. On reach

were three or four deep and another
car was making the turn into the gar

right to allow this car plenty of room
and from behind it at eroat sneerl
