KING'S DAUGHTERS ASK THAT DOLL AN9
TOT FUND HE KEPI OPEN LONGER
Letter From itlember Conveys Wish of the President that
Fund tiet the Full Benefit of the Christmas Spirit.
Review Defers to Wish aud Fund Wili Close
Thursday. December the Twenty-first.
The Review received a compliinen
tar y letter Tuesday from Mrs. Alice
N. Dyer, one of th • leading workers
of the King's Daughters in which
she conveys the wish of the presi
dent of the organization, Mrs. E. A.
] harr that the fund be open
longer than the tin,- set for cioEng
which was Saturday, December loth,
A part of her letter is as follow*-:
"The enclosed »hecks for the Doll
and Toy Fund is from the sale of
cigarette tags which we collected
from various pie tes of business.
VIrs. E. A. Pharr, Pi -sidem of the
King's Daughter- has asked me to
write and a.-k the Review, if possible
to keep th« list open a little longer
than the 16th. A great many people
do not get their Christmas money
until late in th month, and others
do not get the "Xmas Spirit" until
just before the g: at da;, when they
start to see Santa Claus for their
Kiddies, then they are more likely to
think of the others."
Since it is the King's Daughters
who are doing the real work con
nected with this fund, the Review
aecedes' to their wish und the fund
will remain open until Dfcc. 21st, so
that everyone who catches the spirit
in any degree may assist in the good
work. As will be seen in the list of
contributions, quite a bit was reali
zed from the sale of cigarette and
tobacco tags gathered from the box
es placed at the business houses by
these ladies. This shews that the
heart a« well as the hands cf the
ladies are at work in this movement
and that they are utilizing every
possible means to see that every
Kiddie in Morgan City has a merry
Xmas, which up to a certaffi age can
only be made so, by the receiving
their portion of the dowry Santa is
supposed to bestow.
You may contribute any time un
til the 21st, but the best time is now.
Many little folks, these days have
been noticed looking in various dis
play windows of local merchants
and all of them are heard to remark:
"I want Santa to bring me this, or
that,'' and two-thirds of those who
happen along and make these re
marks are children whose parents
are not able to see that Santa Claus
will visit them when Christmas
comes, which is only a few days
away. Are these poor little folks
, A .
g°mg to be disappointed? or is old
Santa with his pack going to pay
them a visit? Contributions to the
Review Doll and Toy Fund are still
needed in order that the little folks
whose parents are not in a position
may 3ee their homes are included in
"Santa Claus Itinerary" whçn he
makes his annual tour. The King's
Daughters who are going to make
the distribution have found more
needy homes lately than was
first contemplated and therefore
will require more donations in ordfcr
to see that they are taken care of.
Let's try and see that every little
child in Morgan City is paid a visit
this year. Contributions to the fund
may be any amount and will be
really appreciated regardless of how
small they may be, and all helps to
