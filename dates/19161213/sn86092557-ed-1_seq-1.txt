AWSHINGTON. D. C., Dec. 13.? |
Germany's note proposing peace negotiation*
to the onotny powers was ex
pocted to reach here today In official J
textual form from Charge Grew at Bot- j
Un for transmission to each of the
Entente belligerents to whom It Is ad- i
dressed. I
\ After studying It President IVllson
will decide whether It sahll bo for-!
warded without comment or accompa-1
nted by some expression by the United i
States government.
The extrome delicacy of the situation,
it Is pointed out, would prevent (
the slightest publicity being given to
any possible action by this government
other than the perfunctory transmission
of the note through the American
r rassador In each of tho countries
A.dressed.
It Is regarded here as almost certain
however that the President will take
some step to ascertain definitely the c
>' Entente allies' attitude toward the
:f t peace movement. r
V-1 The probability of the Entente allies i *
' themselves making some announce-1 t
J fent of the terms on which they would ] t(

lug tremendous possibilities tor effect; w

A MB TRAP
German Government Has
Two Objects in View,
They Declare.
(l?v Associated Press)
PARIS, Dec. 13.?"A clumsy trap"
is the caption under which a morning i
paper comments on Prince Chancellor |
von Bothraann-Hollweg's speech In the j
Reichstag.
"Time for feints i? over." says the |
Petit Journal. "Wo aro no longer in
the presnrp of the tribiul efforts of
those persistent appeals to interviewers
and newspaper articles. Chancellor
von Hethmrnitr-Hollweg summoned
the Reichstag not to hear his speech
hut to be confronted with ail axe. Wo
do not .now if at Berlin there are
people so ualve as to imagine thai the
allies are likely to swallow this clumsy
bait i von on the morrow of the events
in Rumania. In any case Field Marshal
von Hinrtonburg's statement!
shows that the military cherish no such
delusions. What is still more t-rtaiu
is that I lie treacherous Carman move
aims at something else than genuine
peace. It seeks internal and external
effect. In Germany it is intended to
convince the people that the government
is not resnonsilile for the sswri
liees imposed and that it advertised
alone are responsible for the continua-l
tion of the stru; gle. Abroad it desire.-;
to persuade neutrals that the allies
are pursuing a policy of ambition. That
is the explanation of the pretended i
moderation in the tone of the speech."
"The speech merely emphasized es-|
sontial weakness which temporary I
success cannot hide." the Petit Journal |
continues. ' It is because Germany |
knows site cannot win that she de-j
sires to end the war. Her plan how- j
ever is doomed, it will fail before the J
immovable resolution c?f the allies.
"The Matin characterized the peace,
proposals as 'mere talk.' "
