The police of 'three cities are today
searching for four-years-old Mary

was kidnapped from her guardian,
Mrs. George . Wheeler, of Hurd' ave

Vauaeviue stage, lormeriy. pjt.xne team
Lane and O'Donnell, Aand how ap-1
pearing in. Colorado Springs, Colo., in
the team of O'Donnell and Blair, has
demanded, through his attorney,
John H. Casey, , that warrants be is
sued f 6r the arrest of Ida . (Lurle)
O'Donnell' who, he alleges," was a par
ticipant in an abduction. ODonnell
has .cancelled all his theatrical en
gagements and is speeding rapidly
towards this' city to take personal
charge of the search for his daughter.
,As a result of the matter being re
ported to the police, thousands of cir
culars are being printed with; a- de
scription" of the child, and its sup
posed custodian and because of the
prominence of the parties" involved
and the beauty of mother and child
the ,' incident will ' create a profound
sensation in the theatrical realm. '
Announcement of the facts con
nected with the kidnapping disclose
that O'Donnell, who .married Miss
Ida R. Lurie, a motion picture ac
tress June 20, 1911," not only found
it'-necessary to press a separation suit
latex" but was forced; through alleged
conduct of his wife to apply to Judge
Paul -L. Miller in the Bridgeport pro
bate court to get custody of his child
tfrton the grounds of desertion . and
neglect. The request was ' granted by
the court last summer and rthe child
placed in, the custody of the father
and Mrs. Wheeler. .
O'Donnell, though traveling ex
tensively throughout the country and
unable to be. in this city often, never
denied the mother the opportunity of
seeing . and visiting the , child at the
Hurd avenue home, it is said.
It is alleged that one- of these visits
was made Saturday afternoon by the
mother, .: who stated that 'she would
like to take the child "down town and
buy her some new clothing. Mrs.
Wheeler decided to accompany them
As she was leaving the house Mrs.
O'Donnell is said to have asked the
guardian to take another child alone
that it, might also see the pretty
Christmas toys, which was done.'"
The; two women were on the street
floor of Howland's when some other
purchasers engaged Mrs. Wheeler in
conversation upon the remarkable
beauty of the child she possessed". ;
"How" many children have you?"
the stranger asked.
'"Four,"- Mrs. Wheeler is alleged to
have said. ;
v "How beautiful that one is,' said
the stranger.
'. "Yes! But here also is a beautiful
one," Mrs.x Wheeler is said to have
replied.
As she turned, to point out the
O'Donnell girl, Mrs. Wheeler was sur
prised to see Mrs. O'Donnell running
out a side entrance of the store with
the girl in her arms. An alarm "was
given immediately but before clerks
or others' could reach the sidewalk an
automobile was hastily turning the
corner into Main street where it was
immediately lost to the followers and
the police who were called upon to
assist in the search. The police im
mediately telephoned to New York
and New Haven where all entrances
to the respective cities were watched
but without success.
Because of certain remarks made
by Mrs. O'Donnell while at the
Wheeler home Saturday afternoon,
the police are inelined to believe that
Mrs. ODonnell will be found in Chi
cago. Her husband has been noti
fied to make 6earch there on his way
East, . . '

as aged, four, beautiful, with dark

Lordship Co. Will Seek Leg
islative Authority to Con
struct Elaborate Street
Railway System ' In
Bridgeport.
Wants Authority to Lay
Tracks on Many Streets
Not Now Occupied By the
Lines of 'the Connecticut
Co.
A movement which is likely
to mean sweeping changes in
the trolley situation in this city
and Stratford -was started to
day when directors of the Lord
ship Go. gave notice of their
intention to apply to the Gen
eral Assembly for the right to
lay tracks on numerous streets
in all sections of the city not
now used by the Connecticut
Go.
When the petition is presented in
the General Assembly there is certain
to be a big fight and delegations of
citizens from this city will probably,
visit Hartford to give their views.
The Lordship Co. at present runs a
trolley line from Lordship park
through HOllister avenue to the corner
of Stratford avenue ; From 'that point
its cars run over the Connecticut Co.
tracks to the center of the city.. The
General Assembly- will be askd to
transfer to the .company all the rights
now' held by the Lordship Park asso
ciation, inclunding, 34 acres , at Lord
ship park developed to amusement and
other business purposes. V
The company already - hai the right
to extend its tracks- ,from the Lord
ship terminus to Hard's corner, Strat
ford, by way of . Mam street, Strat
ford. It asks for a renewal of that
right. It also asks for the right to: ex
tend its trolley tracks on the follow
ing' thoroughfares in this city: From
Haillster avenue to Orange street, to
Central avenue, to Grant street, to
Arsjictreet,. Jo , Hallett a VstreetR -,tK

to IindW street, to Fairview .avenue,
to Wayne street, to Madison avenue,
to Capitol avenue, to Wood avenue, to
Vine "street, - to Coleman street, to
Washington avenue, to Golden Hill
street. ' . . . ..
Another route desired extends from
Madison avenue, - to Coleman street, to
Washington avenue, to Harrison
street, to 3m street.
A third route to be applied for is as
follows:; From Maplewood avenue to
Coleman street, to Washington ave
nue to Golden Hill street,, to Harrison
street, to Elm street to Broad street,
to State street, to Lafayette street, to
Railroad avenue to Broad street, to
State street." . x '
The directors of1 the company are
Walter B.' Lashar, George Windsor,
Ernest P. Lyon, I H. Oorbit, George
B. Clark, Charles 'H. Davis of West
Haven, George W. Davis of New Ha
ven. They applied to Judge Gager
in the superior court this morning
for an order, as required by law, and
Judge Gager signed the order. -
The news of this movement will be
of great interest to residents of sec-
lions not already tapped by the Con-
i t A. S-1 11 ' J 1 A. t
necucui Ko. lines ajia aiso 10 real
estate dealers who have property
along the proposed routes. There
have1 been complaints 'on all sides
'that the Connecticut Co. has not' ex
tended it lines as it should have done
to keep pace with the remarkable
growth, of the city. In fact during
the past 15: years the Connecticut Co.
has added comparatively few miles of
tracks to its local lines. ; .-,
-Those" who have ntot been satisfied
with the services given by the Con
necticut Co. will see in the new com
pany's petition a chance to get bet
ter accommodations. It will not be
difficult to persuade these persons to
go to Hartford to speak in favor of
the Lordship extension.
On the other hand the Connecticut
Co. is not likely to view with calm
ness .the effort of a rival to invade
fertile territory. There is sure to be
excitement when the petitions, are
heard before the General Assembly.
In the meantime the Connecticut Co.
may try to improve conditions so
folks will, gain the idea that present
facilities are good enough.

London, Dec. 13 The indica
tions are that the various gov
ernments of the entente allies
do not intend to act hastily in
making joint response to the
peace proposals of the central
powers.
It was pointed out in well in
formed quarters today that
while ; each one of the allied
governments might indicate its
general attitude, consultation
among the allies under the
treaty binding them to such ac
tion probably would require
two or three weeks..
Paris Papers Derisive
Paris, Dec. 13 "A clumsy
trap" is the caption under
which morning papers print
Chancellor , Von Bethmann
HoliwegV speech in the Reich-
e'zT-'-J:-.,.-" : '
,'The.time 'ortieintsis .pver"
says the Petit Jcmrnal. '
"We are no longer in the presence
of the trial of efforts of those persis
tent appeals through interviewers and
newspaper articles," the paper con
tinues. "Chancellor Von Hohweg
summoned the Reichstag not to hear
his speech but to be confronted with
an act. We do not know if at Berlin
there are people so naive as to imag
.lne that the allies are liely to swallow
this clumsy bait, even on the morrow
of the events in Ruinania. ' In any
case Field Marshal Von Hihdenburg's
statement shows that, the military
cherish no such illusion. What . is
still more certain is that the treach
erous German move aims at something
else than genuine peace. It seeks an
internal and external effect in Ger
many. It is intended to convince
the people ,that the government is not
responsible for the sacrifices impos
ed, that its adversaries alone are re
sponsible for the continuation of the
struggle. Abroad -it desires to per
suade neutrals that the allies are pur
suing a policy of ambition. That is
the explanation of the pretended
moderation in the tone of the speech.
"The speech merely emphasizes es
sential weakness which temporary
successes cannot hide," the Petit
Journal continues: "It is because
Germany knows she . cannot win that
she desires to end the . war. Her
plan, however, is doomed. It will
fail before, the -immovable resoution
of the allies."
The Matin characterizes the peace
proposals as "Mere talk' saying: .
"They contain no territorial, politi
cal or other conditions which oould
serve as a basis of discussion. Ger
many simply says for the hundredth
time that she never desired war and
wishes only to 'protect her rights and
that if her enemies will not listen she
will throw the blame of further blood
shed on them.' The device is too ob
vious. It could not deceive any but
the most ignorant.
"Another motive is the necessity of
making , Germany accept the suffer
ings and sacrifices of another winter
campaign. If only the civilian pop
ulation had to endure this, not much
harm would be done, but the army is
beginning to feel, the strain. During
the last few weeks rations have been
reduced and In ' three . months time
they, will be poor indeed. : . Germany
is compelled to talk of peace, but she
docs it as vaguely as possible in the
hope of spreading dissention among
her enemies and keeping her coalition
together."
In an article in the - Figaro, Fred
erick Capus, dramatist, says: "What
of the conditions? What is the whole
thing for? We want peace, too, but
our peace is not theirs. What then,
are Germany's conditions? Nothing
precise. ' She informs us only that
her, pretensions are moderate, and
proposes to us to stop the war while
she defines them. As soon as we
lay down our arms, as soon as the
image of peace shall have done its
work of disturbing our minds and a
peace party shall have been formed
in France, Russia and England, then
Germany will enlighten us on the
conditions which she now calls mod
erate. ' Such is the trstp. It will be
met by us and by our allies with grim
contempt, not even with anger. The
motive is too clumsy to be worthy of
indignation."
