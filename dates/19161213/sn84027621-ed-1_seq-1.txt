HUISH ARE MOT OPTIMISTIC,
Washington, D. C, Dec. 13. Pres
ident Wilson's course regarding the
German peace proposals is still unde
cided. He awaits the note the Cen
tral Powers asked the United States
to transmit to their enemies.
The impression grew here today
that there was a disposition to find
some way to intimate the sincere
wish of the United States that some
base of discussion at least might be
found. Some officials felt that the
opinion of the governments of the
Triple Entente should be ascertained
before the United States', influence
was exerted.
The German embassy had nothing
further regarding the Central Powers'
terms but admitted that terms were
purposely omitted from the chancel
lor's speech before the Reichstag.
Diplomats believed the entente reply
would be an inquiry as to the basis on
which Germany proposed peace. ; '"'-
REICHSTAG FAVORS PEACE
. Berlin, Dec. 13. Definite proposals
on 'which the Germanic allies were
.ready to make peace prepared for
transmission to the entente nations if
the peace offer is favorably received I
were not disclosed in the announce
ment made by Chancellor Von Beth-mann-Hollweg
yesterday.
The general opinion among Reich
stag members was that the move was
timely and wise ahd the situation
would be advantageous to Germany,
regardless of the reception accorded
the offer by the Allies. 1
Some of the .chancellor's opponents
opposed peace except on the basis of
"woe to the conquered." -
ENGLAND MAY SAY TIME IS
INOPPORTUNE
. London, Dec. 13. The British gov
ernment's attitude toward the German-peace
offer will be made known
in the house of commons tomorrow,
provided there has been time to con
sult with Britain's allies. Little con
fidence is shown here that the offer
will bring any results.
The prevailing opinion generally
was that the .time was inopportune
even for a discussion of peace terms.
There is an undercurrent of feeling
however that something may be gain
ed by stating definitely the objects of
the belligerents. v
ALLIES IN NO HURRY
London, Dec. 13. The Allies' joint
reply to the peace proposals of Ger
many is not likely to be made soon.
It was pointed out here that two or
three weeks would be required for
conferences between governments.
FRANCE HASN'T" HEARD OF IT
Paris, Dec. 13. No official notifica
tion of the German peace note has
been received here.

Slim Chance for Settlement as Long
as American Troops are on
Mexican Soil
(Associated Press)
Mexico City, Dec. 13. Arrivals
f rom 'Queretaro giye the impression
that Mexican agreement to the Mexican-American
protocol depends upon
fixing a definite date for the with
drawal of the American expedition
under General Pershing.
SUPER-RECKLESSNESS
Railroad managers and railroad
men are not always as careful as they
should be, but they don't like to kill
people any better than anybody else,
and it is beyond dispute that many of
the tragedies . sit railroad crossings
are due to the carelessness or. reck-r
lessness of the dear public. The New
York Globe says:
"No railroad company has done
more to eliminate the grade crossing
accident than the Long Island. It has
spent many thousands of dollars to
warn the drivers of automobiles
taking- chances-when a little caution
means safety. Yet in spite of every
thing it seems almost impossible to
save- the reckless automobilist from
his own folly. . ' y ... r.'
"Four times this month automo
biles have disregarded the danger
signals at Franklin avenue, Garden
C:ty ,and run through and broken off
the crossing gates. Three managed
to clear the tracks in safety. One of
the occupants of the fourth automobile
was killed and the other two seriously
injured. ' ,
"An automobilist who will do a
thing of this kind has no right to
drive a car. Not only should he be
deprived of his license, but he should
be punished to the limit of the law.
The public is quick to denounce the
railroad that takes no protective
measures at grade crossings."
PALE HORSE WILL BE
HIS RUNNING MATE
Berlin, Dec. 13. 'Rastenberger, the
premier among German jockeys who
won almost 50 "firsts" this year for
the Royal Graditz stable and who
cleared nearly half a million marks
for his employers, has at last been
drawn into the army. He is now in
training as an "artilleryman at Fran-fort-on-the-Oder.

COMMISSIONER McRAE :'
CALLS FOR CORRECTION
W. A. McRae, commissioner of ag
riculture, who last year completed and
published a very complete report of
the fourth state census, and found
that Florida had a population of 921,-
618, expresses surprise at the esti
mate of the population of 1916 as
sent out by the estimators of the fed
eral bureau of the census, at Wash
ington, in which we are given 16,779
less people than is shown by the cen
sus of a year ago. Seeking to correct
this case of injustice to the state, Mr.
McRae has written the following let
ter to Sam L. Rogers, director of the
census:
"In a press bulletin just sent out by
your office, giving estimates of the
population of the state for the fiscal
year 1916, you say that Florida has
904,839 inhabitants. The estimate
conflicts with our state census of 1915,
when our enumerators afterCareful
personal canvass reported a total of
921,618 people or 16,779 more than
your estimators calculated-we had
one year later. Our state enumerators
showed an increase of 168,999 in five
years over the federal enumeration of
1910, or in round numbers a yearly
increase oi a little over w,uuu. i
have no reason to think this gain has
not been maintained in which event
our present population should approx
imately be 950,000, instead of the
figures you widely publish." ,

While the Germanic Allies peace
proposals overshadowed other mat
ters today, fighting continued. The
press has commented extensively on
Chancellor Von Bethmann-Hollweg's
announcement, although handicapped
by a lack of definite knowledge of the
terms Germany will propose.
Entente newspapers generally were
pessimistic regarding the probable
success of Germany's overtures.
German writers stressed the offer
as a sign of- strength rather than
weakness. , '
The only important happenings to
day occurred on the Rumanian front
where the Teutons continued their
advance in Ea-stern Wallachia. Ber

Berlin, Dec. 13. Five thousand
Greek regulars are fighting against
the French forces north of aKterina,
said a semi-oSScial news agency dis
patch. HELP THE ORPHANS' HOME,
Don't you want to have just a little
part in providing Christmas cheer and
happiness for tne dozens ol Homeless,
orphan and helpless little ones, who
now fill our receiving home to over
flowingand the hundreds of othar
little orphan and homeless youngsters
coming underour care each year? Of
course the biggest thing you could do,
would be to take one or two of these
little ones into your home, as a per
manent Christmas gift? We' have
three sets of twins, and ' just dozens
of other little ones, boys and girls
all of whom are anxiously awaiting
gcod homes and parents. Can't you
possibly take one . or more into your
home?
-Well if. you cannot take a child,
perhaps you can spare a little money,
and oh! we are so greatly in need of
funds just now really our financial
condition is serious. Listen a nickel
will buy a new milk bottle for one of
our babies; a dime will buy a quart
of milk; a quarter will buy a good
pair of stockings; a dollar will buy
candy for our whole crowd of kiddies;
two dollars will board a baby for a
whole week; five dollars will provide
a good home for some poor orphan
child; ten dollars will provide a brace
for some little cripple; twenty-five
dollars will provide a pension for
some worthy little widow and four or
five little kiddies, etc. You just can- -not
send too little or too much to be
of real help. ,
But if you cannot send any money,
or want to send something beside the
money, we would just love to have you
send a package, or box, or barrel, of
children's clothes, hats, caps, stock
ings, kerchiefs, underwear, shoes or
canned good3, jellies, preserves, staple
provisions, meats, vegetables, fruits,
or toys, dolls, etc. Perhaps you can .
get your Sunday school class, or
church, or club, or lodge, or society to
help you do some of these things for
cur little ones. Pleading earnestly
for some help from' you in behalf of
these little orphans right here at your
door, and wishing you a Merry Christ
