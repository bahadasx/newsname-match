until the note delivered to American
Chartre drew, in Merlin, reaches Pres

There were indications to-night that
President Wilson might tirid some way
to express the solemn and earnest wish
of the L'nlted States for a careful con
sideration Of the MiL'Kcstlon of peace,
even before the entente governments
have made known their attitude toward

pointed out. necessarily would he done

T'nlted States free and unembarrassed
to net when an acceptable peace offer
comes.
P.egardless of whether President
Wilson decides to accompany the Ger
inan proposal with any word. It was
said to-night he unquestionably would
tak? steps to learn the attitude of the
entente allies toward the peace move,
and possibly might again send to Ku
rope his personal friend and adviser,
i.'olonel R. M. ilouse.
None of the official dispatches had
arrived to-nlRht. The government's
first information was conveyed in the
Associated Press dispatches from Mer
lin. President Wilson was said to be
deeply Interested, but reserving com
ment. Secretary Lansing maintained a
similar attitude. The Cabinet dis
cussed the development at its regular
Tuesday meeting, but the situation was
described by members as so obviously
delicate that no announcement could
be made.

The absence of any specific terms
for peace In the note, or in the (ier
man Chancellor's speech, was. in a
measure, a disappointment to those
who expected some concrete expres
sion of a basis on which negotiations
in I if ht begin. The German embassy,
however. Is in possession of advices
which outline In a general way what
Germany expects, and the diplomats
of the entente powers, through their
means of being supplied with informa
tion. believe they have a general idea
of what terms the. central powers are
willing to advance as tlie basis for
discussion. Hecent dispatches to the
German embassy indicate a belief that
the general terms might be. in stib

A restoration of the status <|tio ex
isting before the war. This includes
the evacuation of P.elgitim and the re

Northern France, with the exception
of Alsace and Lorraine. No author
ized expression was obtainable from !
the embassy as to whether condition'-i
would he attached to the restoration of
Helgium and French territory, but !

was to make provision for the future

will be made on Thursday of next

will sell the waste paper In bulk, and
the entire proceeds will be given to

the cadets see a chance to get s:>

"Several of the boys told me that

1 .ids for the papers to be collected'
by the schools have not been accepted;
by The Times-Dispatch, which is after j
the highest market price. Newspapers, j
however, will bring not less than 'bi |
cents per 10ft pounds, while magazines
will sell for 7."i cents per Kin pounds, i
or more. Ordinary waste paper wil<
bring as much as fit) cents per hundred.!
l!y Shis it will be seen that twenty
flve pounds brought in by each school
child would result in a total of several
thousand dollars for the schools.
Teachers must co-operate, however,
in bringing the attention of the chil
dren to the movement and keeping it I
fresh in their minds. While the col
lection of the waste paper is promot
ing thrift in Ihe minds of the young
sters. it is also a much easier way to
get money than other plans now in
vogue in the schools. The smallest
school in Richmond should be able to !
raise .$100 before Christmas.
There are forty-four schools in the
city public school system. To collect

Chancellor von ni'thmanu-HollwPK
1 to-day announced to the Reichstag
that (ierniithy, together with her al
t lies "conscious of their responsibility
before (loll, before titeir own nations,
! before humanity" had proposed this
morning to the hostile powers to enter
on p?>ace negotiations.
Practically all the mcinberH of Par

in oris. The crowded house and

for his speech.

The Chancellor first outlined the c*.
i traordimwy political situation. and
J then, insisting upon the achievements
j <f tlx central powers, made an an
nouncement which possibly may lie the.
turning point in the war. The Chan
cellor said:
i "The Reichstag had not been ad
journed for a'long period, but forlu
nately it was left to the discretion of
the president as to the day of the
next meeting. This decision was
i caused by the hope thai soon happy
events in the field would he recorded,
i n hope fulfilled quicker almost than
expected. I shall be brief, for actions
speak for themselves."
The Chancellor said Rouniania had
entered the wnr in order to roll up the
German positions in the east and those
; or Germany's allies. At the same time
the grand offensive on the So in me had
as its object to pierce the German
western front, and the renewed Italian
attacks were intended to paralyze Aus
tria-Hungary.
j "The situation was serious." the
Chancellor continued. "Hut with God's
! help our. troops shaped conditions so
I as to give us security which not only
| is complete, hut still more so than
i ever before. The western front stands.
, .Vol only does it stand, but in spite
: of the Roumanian campaign, it is fitted
out with larger reserves of men and
material than it had been formerly.
The most effective precautions have
been taken against all Italian diver
sions. And while on the Somme and
on the Carso the drum fire resounded
while the Russians launched troops
against the eastern frontier of Tran
sylvania. Field Marshal von Hinden
, burg captured the whole of Western
! Wallachia and the hostile capital of
Mukharest, leading with unparalleled
genius the troops that in competition
with all the allies made possible what
j hitherto was considered impossible.

"And llindenburg does not rest. Mil

foundations for our economic needs
have been laid. Great stocks of grain,
j victuals, oily and other goods fell
into our hands in Roumania. Their
transport Iih? hcKiin. In spite of scar
city, we could have lived on our own
supplies, but now our safety is beyond
1 question."
"To these great events on land," the
Chancellor continued, "heroic-deeds of
equal importance are added hy our
? submarines. The specter of famine,
which our enemies 'ntenrle.d to appear
before us now pursues them without
mercy. When after the termination of
the tit st year of the war the Emperor
addressed the nation in a public ap
peal. Ite said:
Having witnessed such great
events, my heart was tilled with awe

"N'either our Kmperor nor our na
tion ever changed their minds in this
respect. Neither have they now. The
genius and heroic acts of our leaders
have fashioned these facts as firm as
iron, if the enemy counted upon the
weariness of his enemy, then lie was
deceived."
"The Reichstag, by means of ihnr
national auxiliary tear service law
helped to build a new offensive and
defensive bulwark in the midst of the
great struggle," the Chancellor con
tinued. "Mehind the lighting army
stands the nation at work?the gigan

"The empire is not a besieged for

Those in close association with the
new government took the view that
the proposals would prove entirely un
acceptable. mainly because they were
not likly to touch what the ruling au
thorities regard as the most essen
tial basis of any peace, namely, such
guarantees against Herman militarism
as will permit lOngland, France and
their allies to demobilize their vast
armies, reduce their enormous mili

conditions of peace.

Some early expressions indicating
the general drift of sentiment were as
follows:
Sir Arthur Conau Doyle ? "We want
to know more about the terms, for
without them the Imperial Chancel
lor's suggestion of peiiee is preposter
ous and ridiculous. We. too, are con
scious of victory, and his boastings
will be laughed at "
The Marquis of Londonderry?"We
have got to win the war. Peace at
the present time would be disastrous ;

only a question of time, and we will1
win out absolutely."

Following is the text of the note ad
dressed by Germany and her allies to
the hostile governments:
The most terrific war ever experi
enend in history has been raging for
the last two years and a half over a
large part of the world?a catastrophe
i which thousands of years of eommdn
I civilization was unable to prevent, and
which Injures the most precious
achievements of humanity.
I (>ur aims are not to shatter nor
j annihilate our adversaries. In spite of
I our consciousness of our military and
economic strength and our readiness
' tu continue the war (which has been
forced upon us) until the bitter end,
; if necessary, at the same tinui
i prompted by the desire to avoid fur
ther ' bloodshed and make an end to
! the atrocities of war, the four allied
powers propose to enter forthwith into
pen* e negotiations. The propositions
which they bring forward for such
? negotiations, and which have for their
i object a guarantee of the existence,vof
. the honor and liberty of evolution for
; their nations, 'areV according to their
j firm belief, an appropriate basis for
the establishment of\ lasting peace.
I he four allied powers have been
( Obliged to take up arms to defend jus
tice and the liberty of national evolu
j I ion. The glorious deeds of our
armies have in no way altered their
I purpose. We always maintained the
. tirm belief that our own rights and
Justified claims in no way control the
rights of these nations.

their unconquerable .strength in this

of the war will not result in breaking
