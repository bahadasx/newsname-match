PEACE STILL FAR DISTANT,
IS VIEW IN WASHINGTON
Conference Likely, but Terms Sug=
jested by Teutons Will Be Re?
jected, Officials Say.
( I- rom The Tribune Bureau )
Washington, Dec. 12.?At first skeptical of the success of Germany's
; reposai for u peace conference, Washington to-night believe*, that- the
German government has executed a master stroke of diplomacy. By
.?nuttm?' t.? suggest terms, Germany leavea the Allie?, it ?j ?thought, no
reasonable basis for a rejccti?in of the invitation to a conference.
w l in the first despatches referring t.? Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg's
? [li'e.h were received it was supposed that the <?tTer included an outline
of the terms which Germany wanted to discuss. This opinion was
?strengthened by semi-official utterances from Teutonic diplomatic quar?
ters, where an outline ?>f the prohahle term- was issued.
MERELY PROPOSES A CONFERENCE.
?Later advices, however, made it appear that Hollweg liad prop
merely a conference at which each belligerent, during th?* winter lull in
the military campaigns, might make known its minimum demands, ami
through which the whole world might learn what the purpose.- ??f the
various belligerents were. On this understanding, it is believed, it will
be hard fur the Allies to i? fuse serious consideration to the offer.
Accepting the invitation to discuss terms, however, would he far from
mail ng pc:? ?nted out. ?t is believed everywhere in official <|ua:
ters that peace is a long way off, because the Allies are not ready to
ac.-ent term- t.? which Germany believer? she is entitled, on the basis of the
?v;?r map.
Washington In Stirred

stirred to the depths by the
German proposal. Fruir, Pr?

It came as a complete surprise
?hi re, ho vever.
?President Wilson let it be k
through ?Secretary Tumulty that h
?ir? ilj interested, but that he
make no commrnt until the vie\
the Allies had been made known
the Alluil ?'tnbat?r-ies and leg-tin

made, as it mipht ? mbarrass their I
governments.
The belief 1? that Lloyd Georg

make a more or les? definite repl
Germany. On this ipeech, it
thought, hangs largely the fate of
German proposal.
The freest comment was mad<
Germanic diplomatic quarter?. Tl
ilec'iarcd that Germany expe
the neutrals of the world, particul
the I'nited States, to encourage
support this effcrt to bring an enc
tl.r war. It was pointed out that P
?dent Wilson had several times
presse?l his readiness to encourag?
diseaseion of peace terms if any
the belligerents should propose it.
Bernstorff I? Hopeful
The Teutonic diplomat* are hope
also that Kr.glan.l and her Allies *"?
consider the offer. They po.nt in si

I iiere is no likelihood, it '.? believed,
that a nsrniistice can be ?rrsnged

HOLLWEQ PROMISES TERMS
ASSURING LASTING PEACE
Seeks Only Guarantee of Safety and Honor,
He Asserts?Kaiser Tells Army to Fight
On Until Foe Accepts
Berlin, Dec. 12 (by wireless to Sayvill?-*).?Germany and
her allies today pmposod to enter forthwith into peace negotia?
tion.-.
The propositions which they will bring forward are, accord?
ing to Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg. appropriate for the
establishment of a lasting peace, and have for their object the
guarantee of existence, of honor and of liberty of ?-volution for
the four allied (Central) powers.
The Austrian Turkish and Bulgarian governments are
making similar proposals. These proposals have been trans?
mitted to the Vatican, and have been handed to the American
Spanish and Swiss representatives here for transmission to the
Entente powers.
TEXT OF THE GERMAN NOTE*
Following is the text of the note addressed by Germany
and her allies to the hostile governments:
The most terrific war ever experienced in history has
been raging for the last two years and a half over a large
part of the world?a catastrophe which thousands of years
of common civilization was unable to prevent, and which
injures the most precious achievements of humanity.
Our aims are not to shatter nor annihilate our adver?
saries. In spite of our consciousness of our military and
economic strength and our readiness to continue the war
(which has been forced upon us) until the bitter end, if nec?
essary; at the same time prompted by the desire to avoid
further bloodshed and make an end to the atrocities of war.
the four allied powers propose to enter forthwith into peace
negotiations.
The propositions which they bring forward for such
negotiations, and which hav?> for their object a guarantee
of the existence, of the honor and liberty of evolution for
their nations, are, according to their firm belief, an appro?
priate basis for the establishment of a lasting peace.
The four allied powers have b?*en obliged to take up
arms to defend justice and the liberty -,f national evolution.
The glorious deeds of our armies have in no way altered
their purpose. We always maintained the firm belief that
our own rights and justified claims in no way control the
rights of these nations.
RUIN THREATENING EL'ROPE
The spiritual and material progress which was the
pride of Europe at the beginning of the twentieth century I
is threaten?'d with ruin, (iermany and her allies, Austria
Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, gave proof of their un
compierable strength in this struggle. They gained gigan?
tic advantages over adversaries superior in number and
war material. Our lines stand unshaken against ever re?
peated attempts made by armies.
The last attack in the Balkans has been rapidly and
victoriously overcome. The most recent events have de?
monstrated that, further continuance of the war will not re?
sult in breaking the resistance of our forces, and the whole
situation with regard to our troops justifies our exjHvtation
of further successes.
If in spite of this offer of peace and reconciliation the
struggle should go on. the four allied powers are resolved
to continue to a victorious end. but they disclaim responsi?
bility for this before humanity and history. The imperial
government, through the goo?i offices of your ?'xcellency,
ask the gov?-rnment of (here,is Inserted the name of the
neutral power addressed in each in-tar.ee) to bring thi?
communication to the knowledge of the government of
(here are inserted the names of th?- belligerents).
KAISER NOTIFIES GENERALS OF OFFER
Emperor William has notified his commanding g?-nerals of
Germany's peace offer, and has informed them it i-? still un
ceitain whether the offer will be accepted. The Emperor's
order is addressed also to "my navy, which in the common light
has loyally and effectively staked all its strength." It follows:
"Soldiers: In agreement with the sovereigns of my allies
and with the eonsciou.sness of victory I have mad?? an off? r ni
peace to the enemy. Whether it will be accepted is still un?
certain. Until that moment arrives you mil] light on."
