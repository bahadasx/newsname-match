I Road Meeting at Bowling Green.
On January 17th to 20th, inclusive,
there will be held at Bowling Green,
Ky., the County Road Engineers' Con
vention. It is the first time that such
a meeting has ever been held in West
ern Kentucky and all county officials
and the State Department are en
deavoring to make thefmeeting bhe
largesbof ibsilnd ever held in Ken-.
tucky
At all previous meetings of this
character, the theory of road building
has been mostly discussed, but, after
two years work under the state aid
plan, road men throughout the state
now have practical problems to dis
cuss and the program has been ar
ranged with that end in view.
It has been recommended by the
State Office that every County Judge
bring his entire court bo the meeting
and bhab the counby pay bhe expenses
incurred by such atrip. It is a known
fact that travel broadens a man, and
it is believed by all concerned that it
will be a great help to the various
counties throughout the State to at
tend such a meeting where they can
learn what other counties are doing
and will have an opportunity to in
spect the excellent roads in Warren
and adjacent counties, as well as the
Kentucky Bock Asphalt fields about
which so much has been written in re
cent days
Other States in the union have sev
eral road meceings a year and they
are attended by between two and three
thousand people and in no state in the
union are people more alive to the
road" movement than in Kentucky,
and there is no reason why the meeb
iog at Bowling Green should not be at
tended by at least three thousand peo
ple. Efforts are now being made to
induce the railroads throughout the
State to give reduced rates and it is
believed that such will be lone.
The meeting is held at a time of the
year when no road work is being done
and no working time will be lost by
those interested in road building, and
it is earnestly hoped that all county
officials, all contractors and all citizens
interested in road building will make
a special effort to attend the meeting.

How many of our school children's
parentstver visit the schools or even
know the teachers when they meet
bhem on bhe streets? How many know
what their children are studying or
how they are progressing? Is their
any of you who have a building to
erect, or fence to build, a dress to
make, a house to paint, or whatever
the job may be, that say to the one
you have employed: "Here are the
tools and materials, go ahead and do
it to suit yourself'and ib. will suit me."
Is that not whab many of you are do
ing with your children? You say by
your actions: "Here is ray child with
its books, papers and pencil. I've fur
nished materials and tools, educate
him as you like."
The holiday season will soon be here
and perhaps the best part of it is the
opportunity it gives for home gather
ings and the family reunions that In
these busy days are all too few. Many
a young man finds time bo geb back to
the old hearthstone and sits dowu in
the dear old home circle, who, if the
holidays were omitted, .would be kept
strictly ab his tasks. All schools are
dismissed, boys and girls are at home,
teachers, likewise, are off duty, and,
with no care pressing, in thousands of
places, parents and children have hap
py times together for which they may
thank the festive season.
A LIVE ISSUE.
For more than fifteen years the tem
perance question has overshadowed all
other questions of public policy. First,
the precinct unit, then the county
unit and now State wide. During all
of these fights the -Democratic party
has 'taken the side of temperance.
Fifteen years ago one small State
house was sufficient to house all the
officers needed to run the State gov
ernment. We now have a large and
commodious capilol, well filled with
officers, clerks, stenographers, and
porters and we are told that" the old
Statehouse has been re-opened and re
filled, Fifteen years ago the total cost
of the State government was in the
neighborhood of jive million dollars,
fifty thousands dollars per year. Now
it cost about eight million per annum.
The temperance question is being agi
tated and the people are paying the
reight. This is the people's gover n
menb, bhe majoriby has bhe righb to
rule. Ib is-evidenb bhab a large per
cent of the people want to amend the
constitution so as to prohibit bhe
manufacbure and sale of spiribuous
vinous or malt liquors within the
State of Kentucky, or the shipment
of such liquors from other States into
this State. This Legislative district,
composed of Adair and Cumberland
counties, is largely Republican. We
do nob belong to that parby and do nob
assume to advise who ib nominates for
the Legislature in the coming August
primary, bub we do suggesb to the
Democrats that we nominate a good
man who favors the submission of the
State wide amendment, a man in
whom we have confidence, one who can
nob be controlled by any self constitub
ed political aggregation, which is
seeking to advance their own political
interest at the expence of the public.
It we will nominate such a man and
the Republicans fail to nominate a
man of equal standing the Democrat
can, and will be elected. The bime
has come when the majoriby of the
people will vote for the man who
stands four square on moral questions.
It is not material to Hie people of this
Legislative district why the Louisville
Times declared for the submission of
this question. We see no reason why
its sincerity should be questioned. If
the paper helps secure that which the
people want why shouldn't it have
the same credit that is given obher
publications? We believe in the policy,
the standard set up in the 7th verse of
the 13th chapter of Romans.
The people of this Legislative dis
trict are not interested in the contro
versy between the Times, Dr. Palmer
or between the liquor interest and the
Anti Saloon League. The real ques
tion is," shall we submit the State wide
amendment, so the people can say
whether liquors are to be made, sold
or shipped into the State, and when
the question is settled retrench and
reform, abolish the useless offices and
cut the expense, so that the tax rate
can be reduced.

Does anyone ever notice the wistful
faces of bhe children peering into the
fascinating shop windows ab this sea

is their owner's only glimpse of Christ
mas? That in their whole miserable
existence never a penny has been han
dled by them of their very own? Let
the childless one, and the sorrowful
one, as well a those who daily take
their walks abroad, think of this, and
each one in his own way do his best to
gladden some life, and by doing so
feel by Christmas nighb thab bhere is
some after all worth doing and living
for in this old world, and the New

A word to you sonny, who is smok
ing cigarettes on the sly. What do
you want to be when you grow up a
stalwart, healthy, vigorous, broad
shouldered man, or a little, puny,
measly, no 'count, weak-minded dude?
If you want to be a manx, strong like a
man, with hair on your face, brains in
your head and muscles in your limbs,
you just let those cigarettes alone.
If you want to be a thing, pitied by
your folks, despised by the girls and
held iu contempt by the fellows, keep
righb on smoking and end your days in
the insane asylum.
