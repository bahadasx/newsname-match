After viewing the bodies, the jurywill
adjourn until a future date to
allow the officers time to summons
witnesses to testify before the jury.
The jury will probably meet again

The accident which caused the
death of Carter and Rockenstein occurred
at 5:32 Tuesday evening at
the West End crossing at Adamston;
They had been delivering meat to tho
Kerns store at Glenwood and were
returning to the city. The approach
to the crossing Is rather steep and the
road on account of the snow and inud
' was very soft. The car could not
j make the grade in high gear; so. Carter
who was driving the car dropped
back to low gear and the car was
moving along nicely. On account of
