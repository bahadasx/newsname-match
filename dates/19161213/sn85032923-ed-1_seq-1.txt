Inspection Of Ballots To Proceed This Morning
And Compells Hunt To Dismiss Contests

PHOENIX, Dec. 11. The out
stannding features today in the at
tempt of Governor Hunt to retain his
office in the face of the election ot
Tom Campbell were the refusal of
the Secretary of State to issue a cer
tificate of election to Mr. Campbell
and tiic proceedings in Judge Stan
ford's division of the Superior court
The judge this afternoon over-ruled
the contention of the Campbell at
torneys that all of the ballots must
be in the custody of the court before
they could be inspected, and the work
of reviewing the Maricopa ballots
will begin tomorrow morning.
A deflection of voice kept Governor-elect
Tom Campbell from receiv
ing from Secretary of State Sidney
Osborn his certificate of election this
morning. That deflection might be
the telephone's fault
But Saturday the governor-elect j
had a talk over the telephone with
the secretary of State. The governor
elect understood him to say that he ;
would issue the certificate of election

not get it this morning or any time j

At the capitol at 11:30 o'clock this
morning the governor-elect called up- j
on the secretary of State, to inquire !
after the certificate and was informed i
that he, the secretary, did not say he)
would issue the certificate Monday
morning. "I said," said the secretary.
that I would return to Phoenix Mon
day morning and would issue the cer
tificates. and yours would be the first
one issued."
That splits hairs, or telephonic con
verse, as the case might be. The sec
retary was not busy at the time and
the mechanical work of issuing the
certificate could not take long, he ad
mitted. But he didn't do it, intimat

sniff. It wasn't very much, but the
crisp air outside, perhaps, added to
augment that sniff. Nevertheless it
was construed by intimation that the
certificate might be "estopped."
"There is just one clause in the law
that might lead somebody to bring an
cstoppal," said Osborn. "But you can
go ahead and make your plans just as
if the certificate had been issued," he
added.
Governor-elect Campbell looked
rather puzzled for a moment then
said: "Well, it docs seem to me
yes, I do have a faint . recollection
there has been an election recently,
and that I was elected. According
to the voice of the people I am the
next governor. But " and the sub
ject changed to notes and messages
and that reminded Governor-elect
Campbell that he would have to write
a message to the legislature, that lie
would have to get busy at once, that
his certificate would, he felt, put a
certain punch into the message which
might otherwise be lacking, as he in
tended to write the message himself.
"Then, too," said the governor
elect, "if I had that certificate I could,
the morning I take office ask Gov
ernor Hunt if he preferred to walk or
ride from down-town to the capitol."
But no certificate was forthcoming.
"You can rest assured, Tom," said
Osborn, "that so far as this office is
concerned you will get your certificate
and it will not make any difference
whether your plurality is 30 or
15,000."

Court Proceedings.
I Tllr1r ftnnfnrfl in tlio .nnprtnr
court this afternoon at 2 o'clock over
ruled all motions to the contrary and
ordered that the inspection of ballots
in the contest of Governor Hunt
against Governor-elect Tom Camp
hell begin in open court tomorrow
morning. The first county to be tak
en up will be Maricopa county.
Judge Stanford incorporated in his
ruling that attorneys for Governor
Hunt must cither dismiss all other
contests in other counties which they
have started in the interest of the
governor or have those contests re
moved to Maricopa county. This ac
tion was taken in order to bring all
of the ballots within the jurisdiction
of the Maricopa court; as with con
tests on in other counties the ballots
of those counties will be in the hands
of the respective courts.
In the case of the contest for a
county office that it will be necessary
for the contestant to sec that the bal
lots of that county are brought into
court Attorneys for Governor Hunt
assured the court that they would
take the necessary action in all con
tests in which they arc interested, and
the court gave them 4S hours in which
to do so.
Hunt's Bond Raised.
At the very outset there was some
slight skirmishing over the question
of bond to be furnished by the con
testant, counsel for Mr. Campbell al
leging that the bond of $600 filed by
Governor Hunt at the institution of
the contest is not sufficient. After
some little argument between counsel,
Judge Stanford announced that he
would require the filing of an addi
tional bond of $2,000 by Governor
Hunt to insure the expense of the
contest in case he loses it, and Sen
ator Ives announced that the bond
would be furnished.
