A NEW TEN CENT STORE
FOR ABBEVILLE
i 1
You now see a nqw sign in the
place where the store of the A. M.
HiH & Co., were formerly located,
rtiol- ftia Wm TT. P.nhh Comnnnv'R
5 and 10c Store. Either the attractive
appearance of this store, or the
many useful and beautiful articles,
as well as the Christmas toys and
candies so advantageously displayed
in the windows, is drawing quite a
crowd of enthusiastic Christmas buyers.
In these windows you will see
articles that are plainly what you
would indeed term, "Ten cent bargains,"
such as beautiful pieces of
glass-ware, china-ware, tin-ware,
gTanite-ware, a full line 6f toilet articles,
and all kinds of really beautiful
jewelry and novelties/ They, especially
call your attention to the
line of china-ware which is to be put
on as "special" for Saturday, the
opening day. In this assortment you
will find a number of large platters,
pitchers, mixing bowls, and many
other useful pieces. If you see all
this from the windows, then what
must you see from the inside? It
was reported that several of the
children were late for Sunday school
Sunday morning. In explaining this
it might be safely said that they had
forgotten the flight of time in their
ardent contemplation of "the many
things they wisht they *>ad" in the
windows of the ten cent store.
Many of the bright girls of Abbeville
and the adjoining country will
be employed in this store.
This store has one of the best locations
to be had in Abbeville and
is modern and up-to-date in every
respeqt. The people of Abbeville
will no longer have to go to Greenwood,
or any of the larger towns,
for their ten cent articles, but on
the other hand this store will draw
trade from other sections. Everybody
knows the advantage of having
a store of this kind in a town, and
Abbeville is to be congratulated oh
hei good luck in securing one of
this up-to-date line of stores.
On Friday afternoon, December
15th, this store will be open for inspection,
at which time no goods
will be sold. Mr. Robert E. Henry,
the able manager, invites you to
come and "see for yourself." Saturday
morning, December 16th, will
be the opening day.
Nothing over ten cents.
