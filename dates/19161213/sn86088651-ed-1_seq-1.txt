N PEACE
Representing so Many Countries, Both Allies and
Teutons, in Foreign Capitals, the United
States Would Be the Natural Medium of Com
munication Before Making any Suggestions,
Washington Would Like to Know Temper of
the Allies Would do Nothing to Destroy Use
fulness as Future Meditator.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 13. Presi
dent Wilson's course of action regard
ing Germany's peace proposals re
mained undecided today 'while he
waited for the official notification. It
Is believed, however, that while he
will avoid any action that might
hin
der future usefulness as an Interme
diary, he will convey the delelcate In
timation that the United States de
sires some form of discussion.
The President was closMed with
Colonel House today and cancelled all
outside engagements.
The United States, by reason of Its
dual responsibility of representing the
Interests of most of the central pow
ers and the entente governments In
the capitals of their enemies, would
of course become the medium of com
munlcatlon through which any reply
of the entente government to the con
tral belligerents would be made. Many
officials feel, therefore, that an Indi
cation of the temr of the entente
governments should be available be
fore the Influence of the United
States was thrown Into the balance.
The German embassy had no fur
ther advices today on the terms of
peace proposals. It was freely admit
ted that the terms had been purpose
ly omitted from the chancellor's
speech and the note, because the sole
purpose was to propose a conference
on terms of peace, carefully avoiding
ny reference which might be made
a basis of refusal.
