FIGHT TO A FINISH
Watcrl'ord Men Kiiukc in l'w for
All A Cane, Heaviest Artillery
Used, Wielded Kfleetively
A light which landed two of the
men concerned in the hospital and the
third in jail occurred Thursday noon
at the farm of F. K. Ilarri.son in Wat
crford. The . other men. v.-ere John
Swift and William 't'orbes.
Ilarri.son is in -the iiospital with se
vere injuries to the skull. Swift was
taken to the hospital, but after hav
ing his bruises dressed left, Forbes
who was the least bruised of any of
the contestants was lodged in jail, but
was released on $200 banl, which was
furnished.
How the trouble originated is un
known, but all the men were said to
have been intoxicated. They were
said to have use various weapons, the
one that seemed to have been used
with the greatest effect being a heavy
cane wielded presumably by Forbes
as he seemed to bear the least visible
results of the fracus.
Dr. French of Concord was the first
to arrive on the spot, as after fight
ing nearly to a finish, they decided
t'hey needed medical attention, and
so called him. Sheriff Worthen and
Deputy Sheriff liarriman arrived soon
afterwards.
According to the officers version the
appearance of the room looked as if
it had been used for a slaughter house,
and the men themselves at lirst sight
looked like the victims. So far as
could be learned it was thought that
the men " injured the most wero the
aggressors. Tut they have not given
any comprehensive story of the en
gagement. Dr. French stated that is far as he
could see the bruises were caused by
the cane, Harrison having been badly
beaten about the head, as was also
Swift. " An investigation is 'being made
by States Attorney Xorton into the
affair, but the men had made no state
ment up to last night that would fix
the blame.

ITaeli Anxious to Secure Prizes For

testJudges Have Work
Cut Out For
Them
Two weeks away from Christmas
and thousands of holiday shopers lin
ed the business streets of St. Johns
bury Monday night and were dazzled
by the splendor of the beautiful win
dow displays prepared by .the mer
chants of the town.
Promptly at 7.30 o'clock bombs
were set off from Itailroad park as a
signal for the merchants to raise the
curtains on their efforts-in the window
trimming contest "which has been so
successfully engineered by the Com
mercial club.
Crowds lined the streets before the
hour set and the sights that met their
gaze more than repaid them for their
effort in being on hand. Never be
fore have the St. Johnsbury shops pre
sented such a holiday display and the
desired effect, that of getting the
Christmas crowds to shop early, was
brought about. After looking over the
beautiful windows the people filtered
into the stores and the clerks were
ken-busy handling the trade and the
Christmas shopping season was on in
earnest.
School children, anxious to secure
one of the prizes offered for picking
the winners in the contest, were on
hand with note books and pencils to
put down their observations and the
expressions of opinion v that were
heard as to the best windows were so
varied and numerous that the duty
of the judges who are expected to
choose the winners will indeed be a
hard one. !
A - brief description of the windows

Here the.jspcctator is, struck by the
likeness of cither window to .'a bril
liant cheery "circular enclosure Idled
with the very things Santa Claus
most likes to deal out in his trip
around tho world on 'Christmas.
There are bags, suitcases, collar bags,
folding slippers and many other ar
ticles of necessity and convenience lor
the traveller; .there are ""bath robes,
pajamas and bed slippers; there are
manicure and other sets for sister,
mother-or ."her," and . there are' moc
casins .for brother or son. In addi
tion to these there are many other
things that would please the heart of
the "hardest to suit." The windows
are decorated with poinsettias and
holly berries.
Jewetl's Clothing Store.
Men's and boy's furnishings
used in the decoration of this
are
win-
dow. Suits, bathrobes, house coats,
handkerchiefs, neckwear, umbrellas
and many other articles that would
please father, son or any man or boy.
The back ground is a lattice "work
over which runs a green air plant.
To one side arc a few green stream
ers. Hanging from the center of the
ceiling of each window is-a large red
Christmas bell. To either side are
carnations and roses and holly and
berries are run in among the articles
for show.

The first glace at this window
leaves the impression of a large white
umbrella over which are arranged
many neckties. It should be easy to
find one for the most fastidious person
from the collection. Another and
more prolonged glance will! show
shirts, gloves, various sets, cuff links,
scarf pins, hrushes and combs, all
laid out vv)th the greatest of care.
Here, too, as in all the other Avin
dovvs, may be seen tho expected holly
and berries heralding the coming of
Christmas.

One window represents a snow
storm, snowing Christmas, presents,
with Santa Claus and his reindeer
buried in the sno-w for the foreground;
in the background with the genial old
visitor just leaving through the roof
and tho outlines of " other houses
made in Christmas seals. The win
dow shows a snow man at the North
Pole with a box of stationery for each
member of the family. The lines
leading from the pole to tho gifts are
loaded with Christmas bells. Both
windows are in white and are very
attractive. '

FRED CUSHMAN
IN CUSTODY
- i
Deputy Sheriff Garfield Located
Him In Maine Lumber Camp
And Brought Him To Local
Jail .
SKIPPED HIS BAIL
Had Been a Fugitive From JustU'C
Since Ijast July -Ijcft Auto At
Lancaster Station And Went
To Maine A Much Waiited
Man.
When the Alainc Central train pull
ed into the St. Johnsbury depot Fri
day afternoon Deputy Sheriff AI. C.
Garfield got off the train with a man
many local people wanted to see, but
never expected to set eyes on again,
and the man himself evidently did not
want to show himself here. Air. Gar
field's prisoner was Fred E. Cushman,
formerly of East St. Johnsbury but
for the past few months a fugitive
from justice, residing in different
places in Alainc. Cushman was taken
to Caledonia county jail and will have
to answer some very serious charges
in court.
Ijast February a suit was brought
against him by the Pulpit Farm Dairy
of Atanchcster, N. II., who alleged that
Cushman had sold some cat.tle he had
purchased of them and which they
had a mortgage on. The damages
In the suit were set at $5,000 aid
Joseph L. Wells of Graniby furnished
$C,000 bail, allowing Cushman his
freedom.
Last July Cushman was arrested by
Deputy Garfield on a body writ for
Thomas Belanger but about mid
night of the day he was arrested Cush
man got money from Wells and set
tled the Belanger matter and was al
lowed to go again.
The next morning Cushman took his
auto, went to Granby then ran to the
station in Lancaster, N. II., .where he
left his auto in front of the station,
and 'took a Alainc Central train for
Portland. When he .'reached Port
land he telephoned 'parties here who
had a mortgage on the auto that the
car was irvLa.neaster and they could
get it if they wished. Then ho van
ished. .',, Y ' - ' ,'- ' ' '
The case of the Pulpit Farm Dairy
against Cushman was set tor trial at
this term of county court and Wells
was told he must cither produce
Cushman in court or forgeit the bail.
Mr. Wells instructed Deputy Garfield
to go into Alainc and see if. he could
locate Cushman.
Garfield went to Portland and' found
that Cushman went to Old Orchard
from there. At Old Orchard he found
he had worked for a time as man
ager of a large dairy farm there.
From Old Orchard Cushman 'went to
Portland and "jumped from there to
Yarmouth, where he was employed as
meat cook in a large hotel until the
close of the season. From Yarmouth
he went about 80 miles to the town
of Gilead in Oxford county in the ex
tfemo northwestern section of Alainc
and secured employment as scaler in
a large lumber camp there. He was
found there and placed under arrest
Wednesday and brought down to
Portland Thursday and from there to
St. Johnsbury Friday.
Fred E. Cushman is widely known
throughout northern Vermont and
New Hampshire, where he had traded
in cattle for several years, and in all
that territory he had financial mourn
ers. 'Since his escape last July his
personal property on the farm at East
St. Johnsbury has been sold by the
eheriff, and the farm soid by his
father who held the mortgage, and his
wife has brought a suit for divorce
which is to be tried at this term of
court.
SL1TIG II INC. RETURN S
Fall or Snow Monday Night and Tues
day Will Help Business
Once again the hills of Vermont
arc snow-clad. Commencing about 11
o'clock Monday night, a fall of fine
snow continued most of the night and
Tuesday morning. An intermittent
fall of snow during Tuesday and which
began to fall steadily in the early even
ing gave promise of good sleighing for
Wednesday.
After the early coming of the first
snow of one year, which fell to a depth
of II inches, on Nov. 12 and 13, and
remained until nearly Thanksgiving
almost everyone was disappointed with
the rainy weather, which caused the
change of many persons' plans, as they
were expecting a real old-fashioned
"turkey" day, with clear cold weath
er, skating and sleighing.
Alerchants have been looking for
ward to another fail of snow to give
the necessary impetus to the Christ
mas shopping, which is sure to begin
ill real ernest- if the present snow re
mains. A, rapidly falling temperature at
midnight, insures the -presence of
sleighing.1 for a day at least
Farmers also are hoping that ihe
enow will now remain through the
winter so they can begin the winter's
work which is dependent more or less
upon good jjledding. Logging in the
different lalitics will commence aa
kooii as the snow can be depended
upon to stay, and Tjuslne.su generally
is certain to take a brace.

RARE MUSICAL TREAT
Audience Pleased With OrRan Recital
Ry Prof. Gray of Montpclicr
Seminary, At Grace Church
Alusic lovers were given a rare
treat last evening, when they listened
to the organ recital given in the Grace
AI. E. church, by Prof. William Leon
ard Gray, assisted by AIlss Alarion
Cheney Bickford, contralto, and Aliss
.Mildred Pearl , Forbes, reader, of the
music and elocution departments, re
spectively, of Montpclicr Seminary'.
The program -was historical in na
ture presenting reprcseAlatlve' period
uiiu some, oi uiu srcniusi .muskc-ie . ui
musical art, both early, afid modern,
Tho first section of the program con
sisted "of three numbers: "The Toc
cata in C minor, by Bach; Intermez
zo, by Callaerts; and ,an "Idyll" ly
Kinder; Prof. Gray also gave "Sops
les Bois" (Durand), by Guilmant;
Fantasia; "On a Welsh March" ' by
Best; and "Grand Chorus," by La
merer all of which were in such ele
gance of tone production and unusual
pedaling as to bring out the very best
quality of his instrument.
Ailss Bickford in her rich contral
to voice charmed her hearers with
tho simple naturalness of her stylo and
her clear enunciation. She sang six
numbers: "When song is sweet," Sans
Souci; "Oh Heart of Aline." Gallo
way; "Aly Laddie," Thayer; and the
ever popular song by :NCYin, "Mighty
Lak'a Itosc." She also sang: "Al
lah," by Alexander Gibson and the
"Virgin's Lullaby" from the "Coming
of the Kingdom," by Dudley Buck.
The "Virgin's Lullaby" perhaps gave
Aliss Bickford the best chance to enow
the expression and quality for her
voice which so pleases her audiences.
Atiss I'earl Forbes gave two selec
tions, "Here Comes the Bride," from
the little book, "Alary Carey," by
Bosher and "Alary .Magdalene," from
the play by Alaeterlinck. The last
difficult reading showed Miss Forbes
at her best and brought back to her
hearers the sacred story of the death
of Christ.
Montpclicr Seminary has always
been noted for its excellent music de
partment and the entertainment last
evening approved the reputation to
these who were fortunate enough to
attend.
