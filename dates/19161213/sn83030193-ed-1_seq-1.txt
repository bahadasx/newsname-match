WIFE INSANE. KILLS
Gustavc Blum I lad Got Leave
From Training Ship to Visit

FAILED TO CATCH TRAIN.
Took Children Home, Played
Them to Sleep Before
Tragedy.
After eoothlng to sleep his ten-year-old
son John and four-year-old
daughter HIslo with "Tho Rosary."
Oustavo Rlum killed them with an
automatic pistol and committed sui
cide, at No. 939 Morris Avenue, In tho
Dunton section of Jamaica, l. I., some
(lino before 1 o'clock this morning.
Tho bodies wore found by Blum's sis-tcr-ln-law,
Mrs. Ralph llamblott, nnd
her husband, when they returned from
n Manhattan theatre.
Hlum was thirty-eight years old and
seeietary for twelve years of tho
training skip Granite Stato of tho
Naval Militia, moored nt Nlncty
sccnlh Street and North River. A
year ago his wife, Elsie, was sent to
tho Slato Hospital for tho Insano at
Central Isllp, I I., nnd ho bad since
brooded over lier condition.
A few days ago lio received a letter
from tho asylum, which his slstcr-ln-law
believed told him his wlfo wns
worso nnd asked htm to bring tho
children. Slnco Mrs. Ilium has been
In tho institution. Mr. and Mrs. llam
blott havo had chargo of tho house,
taking caro of llttlo F.lsle. Tho boy
lived with an aunt, Mrs. John Suhden,
No. 81 Saratoga Avenue, llrouklyn.
Hlum tnado arangements to tnko the
children to Central Isllp yesterday.
Hu left tho training ship at 10 A. M.
and tho boy met him in Ilrooklyn and
went with him to Jamaica.
Ilium missed tho train and returned
homo with tho children. Ho seemed
very morose, but later took thu chil
dren to a moving picture theatre.
When Mr. and Mrs. Hamblctt came
In at 1 o'clock this morning Mrs.
Hamblett went to bco if Klslo was
asleep nnd found she was not in her
bed. alio went to Ilium's room and
found tho bodies.
Tho children, In their underclothes,
wero in Ilium's bed sldo by side. Hach
had been shot In tho loft temple. A
pillow was over little John's head,
Tho pollco theory is that tho girl was
shot first, tho pillow being used to
miifflo tlio sound of the revolver In
both Instances.
Apparently, Hlum then took his
wife's photograph, set It in front of
tho mirror of his drcssor so It would
be tho last thing he saw, and shot
htnuclf In tho right sldo of tho fore
head. Ueforo completing tho tragedy,
Rlum had taken from a drawer fill
his wlfo's trinkets and apparently
ciucfully Inspected thum. On his desk
was a stumped letter addressed to
Mr. and Mrs. H. N. Murtln, Chlchos
tcr nnd Morris Avenues.
There nlso was one of Rlum's cards,
on tho back of which was written:
"Notify A. Wnlr, No. 2277 Riverside
Drive." Wali proved to be an olllccr
on tho Granite State,
On tho back of another of Hlum's
cards was this pencilled note: "Colt
atltomatio revolver Is borrowed prop,
erty. Will bo returned Inter."
in point of service Rlum was one
of tho oldest men on tho Crnnlto
State. It was not a member of the
batalllon. but a civilian employee of
tho city.

Out as Manufacturers and

Cutters, tailors, finishers and other
workers In 300 factories In New York
engaged In turning out men's ready
made suits went on Btrlko to-day In
rfnswer to a call Issued by Bldndy
llillmnn, president of tho Amalgam
ated (larment Workers of America.
Illllmau claims that 62,000 men and
n onion are on strike, and his claim Is
not Horlously disputed by tlio Manu
facturers' Assnillntlon, of which Her
bert Ansorgo Is president.
This strike Is a three-cornered af
fair, Involving not only tho Amnlg.v
mated (.larment Workers nnd the
manufacturers, but another union
called tho I'nlted Onnnent Workers
c' America, ths original clothing
workers' union.
Thomas Rlckurd Is president of the
United organization and this union Is
llnod up nn tho sldo of tho manufac
turers and against tho Amalgamated.
The guiding spirit of the United
Garment Workers Is a nhrowd and
resourceful young man namol Penny
Larger. HUlman was formorly asso
ciated with him In tho I'nltod. There
wasn't room for loth and HUlman,
two years ngo, went out and orga
nized tho Amalgamated I'nlon.
When tho Amalgamated began to
talk strike, HUlman demanded from
tho manufacturers nn advancn of J2
a week In pay for each worker and
a reduction of tho working hours
from ten to eight per day; nlso a
slx-dny working week was demand
ed. The gunnent workers got pay
nnd n fcalt for all work over tun
hours.
Hlllinan's dctnund uas refused by
tho manufacturers, who then treated
with Rlckard and yesterday reached
an agreement with him on bohalf of
tho United Garment Workers.
At a big mass-meeting of striking
cutters in Heethovcn Hall this after,
noon As.iomblyman Abruham I, Ship
lacoff, of Ilrooklyn, malinger of tlio
Joint bourd of the Amalgamated As
soclatlon, denounced tho agreement
between the manufacturers and the
United Garment Workers union as
a fake. Ho charged that th manu
facturers nro using tho I'nlted orgunl
ration as a strikebreaker.

IN SECH LLOYD GEORGE IS
PREPARING FOR COMMONS
Both London and Paris Look Upon
Hollweg's Proposal as a "Trap"
See Ttfo Chance for Early Ending
of the War.
JOINT REPLY TO COME
AFTER FULL DISCUSSION
LONDON, Dec. 13. The
toward Germany's offer to discuss
in the House of Commons to-morrow if Great Britain has time to con
sult witli her allies. It is considered more probable that no formal notice
wiil be taken of Chancellor von Hctiimann-Ho1lwe",'s speech until next
Tuesday, when Premier Lloyd George is to address the House of1
Commons.
It is staled on reliable authority that the Premier Is preparing an
answer to the German Chancellor to be delivered in connection whh
hib general statement on the Government's policy.
The indications are that the various Governments of the Enlcrta
allies do not intend to act hastily in mailing joint response to the peace):
proposals of the central powers. It is said that while each one of the
l-ntentc Governments might indicate its general attitude, consultation
among the allies under the treaty binding them to such action probably
would require two or three weeks.
"The London press ulilch supporti thn Administration scoffs at
(he terms of peace ns outlined lu despatches from Washington, and
culls It u "(icriiiiin trick."
Despatches from other entente capitals show that the press Is taking
a similar view. In Paris U is called a "Clumsy Trap."
The possibility Hint President Wilson will make some, suggestion
lien fonianllng the offer also Is much discussed. It In Intimated that
ho might nt least express willingness, to conrcr the terms of tho
L'nloiitn to thn Central Toners.
Thu report Is current hero that Kmperor William Is about to an
nounce tho grunting of a parllumenlnrr form of gorernment to
(,'erninny
In oflicI.il circles little or no hope is entertained that the proposals of
Imperial Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg, in the Reichstag, will end
the war.
In financial circles to-day there was no inclination to view Germany's
offer to open peace negotiations with any more enthusiasm than was
displayed in the case of previous suggestions.
PAKIS, DCs. l L If a reply is made to the German note it will ba
only alter consultation with the allies of Prance, and such conversations
would require considerable time.
Germany's suggestion is rejected in authoritative quarters, where it
is considered to be a repetition in more concrete form of the peace dis-cu-ssioib
originating in Berlin from time to time in the last fifteen months.
