Power of Money.
You tell me that money cannot buy
the things most precious. Your com
monplace proves that you Jiave never
Known the lack of it. When I think
all the sorrow and the barrenness
bat have been wrought in my life b.v
ihe want of a few more pounds per an
num than I was able to earn I stand
aghast at money's significance. What
kindly Joys I have lost, those simple
forms of happiness to which ever.v
heart has claim, because of poverty.
I think it would scarce be au
exaggeration to say that, there is ne
moral good which has not to be paid
for in coin of the realm.—From "The
Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft," b.v
(reorge Gisslng.
America's First Lighthouse.
The first lighthouse built on this con
tinent was at St Augustine. Fla. It
chief U9e was as a lookout, whence the
Spanish people of the town could see
vessels approaching from Spain or uc
notice of the coming of foes in time
run away. The tower attracted the a
tentlon of Francis Drake as be w.-i
sailing along the coast with his flei
of high pooped ships on his way home
from pillaging the cities of the Spanish
main, so he stopped long enough to
loot the town and destroy what he
could not take away.
