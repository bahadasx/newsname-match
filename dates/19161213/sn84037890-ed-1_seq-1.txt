WILSON CABINET
TOSTAYINTACT
)f ery Member Except Pos
ibly Gregory Will Stay
BAKER MAY sluO JUSTICE
Neither McAdoo Nor Houston
Will Resign McCormick
For War Head.
McADOO SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF
Washington, Dec. 11. Every
member of President Wilson's Cab
inet with the possible exception of
.Attorney General Gregory Is ex
pected to remain In office after
March 4, when the President's sec
ond term begins. It was learned
definitely today that all of thorn
have been or will be asked to keep
their posts.
Reports concerning possible re
signations have centered chiefly
around Secretaries McAdoo, Hous
ton and Baker and the Attorney
General. It has been taken for
granted that Postmaster General
Burleson and Secretaries Lansing,
Daniels and Wilson would remain,
and indefinite rumors that Secretary
Hcdflcld might wish to retire to pri
vate business were denied some Mm
ago.
Secretary McAdoo today person
ally denied that be had any inten
tion of resigning. The roports In his
case have been most persistent, In
spite of denials by officials close to
the President.
Regarding Mr. Houston, it be
came known that the officials of
"Washington University at St. Louis
havo extended his leave of absence
as chancellor of that institution so
that ho can continue as head of the
Department of Agriculture. Be
cause of the investigations into the
hlg'i cost of living and other impor
tant work undertaken by Secretary
Houston, the President is known to
consider his continued service in the
Cabinet as highly desirable.
linker May Ilo Shifted.
Although Secr.etary Baker has
been credited with a desire to leave
the Cabinet, it is learned that in all
likelihood he will remain. It Is un
derstood, however, that there is a
possibility that he-may bo shifted to .
the Department of Justice if Mr.
iGregory insists on resigning, and .
that Vance C. McCormick, chairman
of the Democratic National Commit-1
tee, may be placed In charge of the
War -Bepartment. I
,In the Attorney General's case the
reports about his Intention to resign
havo been very circumstantial, and
havo been generally accepted by of
ficials as true, although ho has given
no indication of ills Intentions. The
President has, offered Mr. Gregory a
seat on tho Supreme Court once, and
should another vacancy occur dur
ing tho Administration It Is thought
probable he would be seriously con
sidered again.

MOTH CAVE HOTEL
BURNS TO GROUND
Registers Containing Autograph
j Signatures of Famous
Personages Lost.
'
' Mammoth Cave. Ky., 9. The
original Mammoth Cave Hotel, part
of which was built in 1811, was de
stroyed by fire, which, starting from
an unknown cause at 3 o'clock thl3
mprnlng, consumed the building
within two hours. The employes of
the hotel escaped, but lost all their
belongings. Practically nothing was
saved. The loss Is about $50,000.
There were few guests.
All the registers of the hotel and
cave, which contained perhaps the
greatest collection In existence of
autograph signatures of famous men
and women, wero destroyed. The
registers, which In part were more
than a century old, contained the
names of such famous porsonagps its
tho late King Edward of England,
Jenny LInd, Edwin Booth, the Grand
Duke Alexis of Russia and Don
Pedro of Brazil.
While the ruins were still smok
ing, this morning visitors who ar-rlvcd-"on
the morning train wero
sent on a tour of the cave at tho
scheduled hour.
The famous "cottage row," which
was built In 1832, was binned to the
ground, as was the main hotel. Tho
Mammoth Cavo Hotel was perhaps
the most historic structure of its
kind In tho United States, as the
first part of it was built la 1SU and
was used In 1812 to shelter the min
ers who secured tho saltpeter from
Mammoth Cavo to make gunpowder
for the War of 1812.
The dining room nnd ballroom
were ninde of hand-hewn timbers,
and it is related that among those
who assisted in building this part of
the hotel were many of the friends
nnd neighbors of Abraham Lincoln's
family. A part of lie hotel was
originally built of logs and later
woathcrboarded.

Hudson Bay Company was offering)
to resoll several million bushels of'

RECORD BROKEN WHEN
BULL SELLS FOR Sir,, lot)
Chicago, Dec. 9. The 191C Inter
national Livestock Exposition, which

This sale will give the Hereford
fans something to crow over for
many months, as the rivalry between
the Hereford and Angus breeders Is
Intense. Col. W. II. Ro: of Shel

Hereford, bought Beau Perfection

Willing to Co-operate in Ovcry
Way With the Liberal Ele
ment of Either Party.
PRESIDENT WILSON INDORSED
Washington, Dec. 8. A call for a
conference of those Progressive
who are not in sympathy with for
mer leaders of the party "In asking
tho Republican Old Guard to glvt
us places on the Republican Execu
tive Committee" was Issued here to
night by Matthew Halo, of Massa
chusetts, as acting chairman of the
Progressive National Committee.
The step follows the overtures mad'!
by Raymond Robins, Gilford PIu
chot and others at a meeting in Chi
cago this week for a voice in the
management of Republican party
affairs.
The Progressive Organization
Committee and members of the old
Progressive National Committee who
have biHn en-operating with th'-(
committee arc asked to meet in Now
York December 15 to arrange plan-,
for tho conference which is to be
held In St. Lotus duriu., the winter.
In his call Mr. Halo says that the
liberals of tho nation "must organ
ize icgardless of their past party af
filiations and regardless of their
choice for President this fall," anil
that it is to form a nucleus for such
a neiv and broader liberal organiza
tion that the St. Louis conference 1
called.
Principles Above Puity.
"We Progressives have always
been more interested In the succesi
of tho principles for which we are
fighting than In the existence of our
party as a separate entity," sa:-3 tho
call. "We havo always been ready
to support either of tho old parties
when either of them commits Itself
definitely and Irrevocably to a really
liberal program. Until then, how
ever, we are not Democrats; we are
not Republicans; we aro Progres
sives. "Many of us thought that ProV
dent Wilson h:i,i gone far toward
committing: the Democratic party
nationally to such a liberal pro
gram, therefore we voted for him.
Wp felt that the Republican pari
was committed o a policy of reac
tion and that the Republican can
didate was committed to a policy of
evasion. Theroforo wo refined t'
follow those of our former heads
who attempted to pcriuade ua tur.t
the Republican lmty had beeont
progressive merely because a f.-w of
these former Progressive loader i
had been given prominent but pow
erless positions on a Republican
Campaign Committee. For tho same
reason we now refuse to Join then.'
Progressive P.i'puhllcniis In asklnr
the Republican Old Giiaid to glvo
us places nu a Republican Executive
Committee as proof of the liberali
zation of tho Republican party.
Stand Against Old (ium-d.
"Wo aro unwilling to compromise
with the Old Guard of either party.
Wo aro willing to co-operate in ev
ery way with tho liberal element of
either party. Wo stand ready to he'p
President Wilson at all times and In
all ways In his fight to liberalize the
Democratic party and we stand
ready to help Hiram Johnson, of
California, at all times and In all
ways In his light to liberalize the
Republican party.
"Sooner or later, tho liberal ele
ments of nil parties and of all sec
tions, North and South. East and
West, will unite to form a really co
herent nnd n really national liberal
party perhaps under one of the old
party standards, perhaps uudv i
now standard and will completo
tho work begun so splendidly h
Woodrow Wilson and Illram John
son. Wo Progressives must be iei'
dy to ilovnto our lives to this work.
Wo must see clearly that p'uccoi3
cannot come through compromise or
through barter, but that success can
come through unfaltering loyalty to
Progressive principles, nnd throush
undaunted courage In fighting 'thoso
who opposo these principles."
