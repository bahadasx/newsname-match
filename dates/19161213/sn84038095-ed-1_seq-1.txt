AUTOS COLLIDE
Bib Auto Bu? Belonging fto Hilton
Bus Line Crashes Into Touring
Car Owned by John Weiss
.FORTUNATELY NO ONE INJURED
Both Cars Damaged—Bus Hurrying to
Northwestern Station—Drivers
Should Use More Care.
An automobile accident occurred on
tjae corner of Chestnut and Main St.
shortly before the noon hour on Sun
day which might easily have resulted
in the death of several people but for
tunately only One person was slightly
injured. The big auto bus belonging
to the Hilton Bus and Transfer Line
trashed into a seven passenger auto
mobile driven by Mr. John1 B. Weiss
at the Tabor corner. Doth machines
were badly damaged.
Mr. Weiss, and seven children who
reside a mile north of Manning, mo
tored to Denison Sunday morning to
.spend the day with Mrs. Weiss, par
ents, Mr. and Mrs. A. B. Lprenzeri.
They drove into Denison over the
Lincoln highway turning the corner
at the college and-going west on the
Chestnut street. Mr. Hilton was hur
rying to the Northwestern depot and
was going down Main street past the
Balle-Broderson store when he saw
the touring car and fearing that the
car might not get across the itersec
tion, he applied the brakes but his
speed was so great that the accident
could not be avoided. The bus struck
the touring car in the center, throw
ing it up against the curb stone and
breaking the electrolier on the cor
ner. Fortunately the Weiss car did
not turn turt'lo or the occupants
might have easily sustained serious
Injuries. Otae of the little girls was
bruised, about the head slightly but
nothing serious.
Both cars were badly smashed up
and the 4amage will amount to sever
al hundred dollars. Mr. Weiss pur
chased his car only two weeks ago
from the Denison Auto Co. and had
driven it less than two hundred miles.
Tie stated that he saw the bus coming
but expected it to slow do^n as he
supposed the regulations of 8 miles
an hour such as'are enforced at Man
ning held good here. Mr. Hilton* we
are told did everything possible to
stop his -heavy machine and the fact
that the tires slid for about a hundred
feet bears out this statement.
An accident ol this kind only goes
to shtow that drivers of machines
should exercise every possible pre
cautioh 'while driving in the city. It
might be well for the city officials to

THREE MILL LEVY
In Order to Care for Extra Grading
in Paving Anticipation Coun
•1' cil Makes Levy
The city council held a session at
the city hall last evening, at which
time several Important matters caine
up for consideration. The new storm
sewer laid in the south part of the city
was accepted from the contractors as
the work was satisfactory and coming
up to the plans and specifications as
prepared by the city 'engineer.
M. P. Henfro, who.erected the new
pump house, appeared before the
council and asked for a fin^J settle
ment. It is said that the pump house
required a few changes before it
would be acceptable to the city fath
ers, and this morning an inspection of
the building is being jnade and if sat
isfactory the settlement will be made.
At the, meeting last evening a levy
of 3 mills was made to cover the ex
penses of the paving put in this yeaf.
The city has to pay $1,666.67 for pave
ment put iri in front of property where
the paving Amounted to more than the
assessed valuation. In addition to this
the city will have to pay for the pave
ment in. front of the federal building,
which amounts to in the neighborhood
of 82.000.
The council instructed the mayor to
see that the laws governing the op
erations of automobiles in cities and'
towns be 'enforced here before some
one is killed. There has been any
number of complaints made because
drivers Of machines are uriing the new
pavement for a speedway, disregarding
the safety and rights of pedestrians
and drivers of other vehicles. It is
belibved that if a few of the more
careless drivers .were arrested and
fined that it would serve as a lesson.

WINNERS IN THE
CORN CONTEST
Harvey Kruthoff, of Paradise Town
sHip, Wins First Prize of $C5
in Acre Corn Contest.
LOUIS WEGENER GETS SECOND
120 Crawford County Boys Enter the
Contest—96.5 Bushels Per Acre
Was the Best Raised.
Mr. F. N. Olry, county superintend
ent of schools, who has had charge
of the boys' acre corn contest in this
county, has announced the winners.
The reports of the contestants were
sent to Ames to be checked over by
the college professors and the winners
decided upon.
Over 120 Crawford county boys en
tered this contest and planted the
corn, but the work of checking up
carefully and reporting what had been
done to Mr. Olry seemed too much
for them. Many of the boys had good
crops and would have made a good
showing, had they completed the work.
The prize of $100 donated by the
Crawford County State bank of Deni
son and the German Bank of Schles
wig will be divided among th6 winners
as follows:
1st, Harvey Kruthoff, Paradise town
ship, 96.5 bushels /prize, $35.00.
2d, Louis Wegener, Iowa township
94.3 bushels $20.00.
3d, Herbert Steensen, Goodrich
township 87.1 bushels $10.00.
4th, Joseph, Honz, Boyer township
83.1 bushels $5.00.
5th, Benjam|n Trexel, Denison 82.5
bushels $5.00.
6th. Otto Trexel, Denison 80 bush
els $5.00.
7th, Clem Honz, Boyer township

10th, Fritz Blume. Hanover town
ship 55.4 bushels $5.00.
The number of bushels appearing
above represents actual corn without
the moisture or cob. The corn was
picked and weighed as it came from
the Beld, then 100 pounds was weighed
out. This was shelled and weighed,
giving the number of pounds of shell
ed corn from the 100. pounds of ear
corn. A pint of this corn was sealed
up and sent to some elevator to be
tested for moisture. The samples
tested showed from 15 to 19 per cent
moisture and from 13 to 26 pounds""of
cobe per hundred, pounds.

county, raised 6590 pounds of corn as
it came from the acre tract. There

were 18 pounds of cob to each 100
pounds of corn and it showed 15 per
cert moisture.
The boys who entered this corn con
test have boen able to raise more corn
than most farmers raise because they
were careful In the selection of their
seed. In most cases the land was no
better than other land and n6 fer
tilizer was used.
One farmer whose son/was in the
contest said: "My boy knows more
about raising corn than I ever knew."
and we believe that he meant it. The
boys have been studying the literature
sent out to them from the experiment
station at Ames and applied what they
learned.
The two Crawford county banks that
have made it possible for the boys to
learn more about some of the useful
things of life are entitled to much
credit. Another contest is being plan
ned for next year and it is. hoped that
many more will enter.
WONDERFUL PLANT
Denison People Visit Overland Auto
mobile Factory and Pronounce It
a Wonderful Plant.
The twenty-seven people from Craw
ford county who made the trip to To
ledo, 0., as guests of the Overland
Automobile oompany, returned home
last Thursday, and from all reports
it was a wonderful trip Two hundred
Overland dealers in southwestern
Iowa and their guests made the trip
in a special train. It is a notable fact
that western Iowa furnished the larg
est train load of visitors of more than
half a dozen train loads from all parts
of the country, but it was ther only
train at the Toledo, factory that car
ried a band.
One train made the trip to Toledo
from Omaha and adjacent territory,
another from Sioux City and Fort
Dodge, another from Florida/ another
from Alabama, and there were other
trains from different sections of the
country.
The first day at Toledo was devoted
to looking over the new models of
the Overland and taking in the im
mense factory. The second day was
spent in listening to various talks and
lectures on the Overland cars and in
seeing moving pictures of educational
value to the dealers and salesmen.
The Denison folks who made the
trip say that the Overland plant is
simply wonderful and it is almost im
possible to conceive the immensity
of it without a personal visit. Many
of ttye guests made a flying trip to De
troit to visit the Ford factory.

PAYS FOR FIRST
PAVING CONTRACT
City Settles With M. L. Flinn Paving
Co. for First Paving Job, in (tlieiw
Sum of $89,000.00.
$43,968.03 OF IT PAID IN CASH
City Auditor W. E. True, of Sioux City
Assists Treasurer in Final Wind
up Employed by Flinn.
C. L. Voss, the city Treasurer, re
ports that $43,968.03 was paid in
to the city coffers last week to apply
on the first lot of payment put in by
the. M. L. Flinn Construction Co., of
Sioux City. Mr. Flinn, together with VP
W. E. True, were down from Sioux
City the first of the week checking
over the assessments and waivers and
The total amount of the first con
tract amounted to about $89,000.00,
and Mr. Flinn states that'it is re
markable that aver half has''already
been paid in. In moat plftcefe where
he has had' contracts for public im
provements of this nature less thai\
halt has been paid at the time 'Speci
fied. It is true that many property
owners in Denison took advantage of
the privilage of signing a waiver and
paying their pavement on the install
ment plan.
Saturday Dec. 5th was the last day
for signing waivers and Mr. Voss re
ports that in the neighborhood of
$15,000.00 is outstanding. This means
that the money will have to be paid
in next spring in full when taxes are
collected. No doubt those who failed
to pay for the improvement or did
not sign waivers figured that thriy
would be money ahead by delaying
until spring. If they have their mon
ey drawing interest at 8 per cent, the
paving assessments will dray but 6
per cent and they are saving 2 pet
cent.
Already there is talk of more pav
ing next summer on the part of the
property owners altho the city fath
ers do not have much to say in regard
to the matter. The city funds ef
course are greatly depleted* on ac
count of grading and changes in wat-
er mains, sewers, etc., but It is likely
that streets will not require much
expenditure in getting in readiness
for the improvement, which will be
considered.
