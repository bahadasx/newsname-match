"IF HER HAND IS REFUSED
HER FIST WILL BE FELT"
British People's Answer to Peace Proposals On Basis
Named by Germany, Is "No" German Press a Unit in
Declaring It Is Germany's Last Offer and That Blame for
Continuance of War Will lie at the Allies' Door
By Ed L. Keen,
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
London, Dec. 13.---The British people have already
answered Germany's offer of peace "no, not on such a
basis as proposed."
That answer was perfectly apparent today. It was re
flected not only in the newspaper comment, but in ex
pressions from the people on the streets.
The nation looks to Lloyd-George next Tuesday to
frame this answer. It cannot be a direct reply, since it is
hardly expected England's consultation with her allies
over what form the diplomatic answer shall be, can be
concluded that soon. But Tuesday will be Lloyd-George's
first appearance as premier before the public and before
news of the German proposal came he had been an
nounced as ready to outline on that date the aims and pur
poses of the new cabinet.
Press and public alike look to Lloyd-George on this
occasion to voice the nation's rejection of any peace which
is based on Germany's idea of her victory.
Germany's peace views, as given out by a German em
bassy official in Washington, were generally regarded as
preposterous and unworthy of serious consideration here.
Lloyd-George's telegram to Premier Briand of France,
together with the former's recent interview granted the
United Press, portions of which were liberally reproduced
in the British pess today, were considered indicative of
Britain's attitude toward Von Bethmann-Hollweg.
The only keynote of difference observable in editorial
comment today was whether the allies, in their reply to
the German note should set forth their own terms upon
v hich peace discussion would be considered.
If the practical unanimity of opinion of the press and
public means anything, the reply will be rejected.
Press comment ranged all the way
from the Daily Mail's suggestion that
(Von Bethmnnn-Hollweg is "no more en
titled to the courtesy of a reply than
tin armed burglar in a private house'
t that made by the Manchester Guard
ian, that negotiations should at least go
as far as to ascertain German's exact
.terms.
A number of newspapers point out
the desirability, in view of the manner
in which Germany made her offer, that
the allies in replying, clearly enunciate
their own aims in the war, for the ben
efit of the world's opinion; that the
teems on which the allies are willing to
filter pence negotiations be clearly set
forth. Such comment holds that only in
this way can responsibility for the con
tinuance of the war which responsibil
ity Germany obviously seeks to place
Upon the allies be turned upon the cen
ttrol powers.
Among numerous1 interviews with
public men gathered by the London
press there is only one advocating ac
e ntnnee of Germany's proposition and
immediate entrance into negotiations.
That is the opinion voiced by Philip
Bnowdea, the empire's leading pacifist
v. ho considers that the allies will incur
ni" ful responsibility if they decline. It
is at least their duty, he. "holds, to nee
wh ether the German proposals contain
the possibility of ending the war on con
ditions, reasonable, and. as far as pos
sible, satisfactory to everybody.
rherB was considerable opinion that
"Tber' haint notliin' as disappointin '
t(ielayg as catehin' up with a pretty
jrifl an' findin' out she's sr. olt wo
hum," said Lafe Bud t'day. Some folks
fire great aviators when it comes t' git
tic ' up in ther oivu estimations.
the note was merely a "clever Teutonic
trick" for the purpose of starting dis
cussion among the a'lies and possibly
thus to create dissension.
German Press Comment.
I Berlin, Dec. 13. If Germany's bid
! for peace is rejected by the entente
powers, it is-certain the central empires
will not take the initiative again to end
I the war.
1 The public, today voiced complete ap
probation of the imperial chancellor's
'solemn warning in the reichstag yester
jday that if Germany's enemies continue
the war it is because they have conquest
: in mind. Such a belief imbues the gen
eral public with an inflexible determin
ation to fight on to the bitter end
against any dismemberment ot the fath
erland. The hopes of the German people are
whole hearted, but if the present pro
posal is scorned the rejection of the
plan for a discussion of terms wou'd
serve to cement the empire more fully
,in its determination, and to dispel peace
j talk, and speculation which has been
'current. y
Berlin newspapers were not sanguine
i today that the peace offer would be ue
ctpted, although applauding the chan
cellor's steps. The comment of Editor
Theodore Wolff of the Tageblatt, is typ.
ical:
"If the. opposing governments should
decline the peace overtures or disclaim
I tb'm as a sign of weakness and suffer
ing mo people win once more ask them
selves whether they are not being driv
en senselessly and without urgent need
to new sacrifices and renewed mas
sacers. "The German people, if their oppon
ents answer In the negative, will see
clearly it is their duty to bear ffie heavy
burden, or heavier burdens, so long as
there is no possibility of agreeing upon
an acceptable and sensible peace."'
Die Post warns the entente "if Ger
many's hand is refused, her fist will
soon be felt with increased force."
The editorial also suggests that Ger
many's own peace offers indicate there
is no necessity of neutral nations' of
fers of peace.
Not Asking for Peace
By Carl W. Ackerman
(ITnited Press staff correspondent)
Berlin. Dec. IS. Germany has not
asked neutral powers to start peace ne
gotiations, ine American embassy s
understanding is that she has merely

or refusal of the tender.

Game Wardens Killed

Stockton, Cal., Dec. 13. Richard .1.
Squire of Lodi and Kay .1. Ileacoek,
deputy fish and game wardcus, were
murdered, supposedly by Greek fisher
men, last night on Gouldin Island.
The body of Squire was found, rid
dled with bullets, in the bottom of his
launch during the night by Walter and
Frank Tinsloy, also fishermen. The
WTdy of Heacock is missing.
Squire has been n deputy game ward
en for a number of years. During late
years he has been very vigorous in en
forcing the law against using illegal
fishing methods in the delta districts,
lie had made many arrests for using
illegal nets, catching under size fish,
etc., and had incurred the bitter en
mitv of law violators in that district.
T
Yet Running Through All Is
the Doubt of Peace Being
Arranged
The bulk of editorial opinion of Am
erienn newspapers today seonn to be
that peace may have been brought near
er by Germany's proposals, lint that
muny things stand in the way of an
early ending of the war. Generally, ed
itorial comment expresses the belief
that the peace proposal will not be ac
ceptable to the allies.
Financiers and publicists who today
analyzed the situation revealed a di
vision of opinion, a majority declaring
peace la brought nearer but is not Rii
immediate possibility because peace at
this time is unacceptable to the allies.
Excerpts from some of the leading
editorials follow:

EXPECT NEUTRAL'S HELP
Wushinglon, Dec. 1.1. The
central powers are counting up
on neutrals of the world to play
an important part in influenc
ing the entente allies to accept
their peace terms, it wus declar
ed at. the German embassy to
day. Whatever peace terms arc sug
gested now might perhaps be in
teqiretcd "as what Germany
would like to get, not what she
expects to get," it was said,
in view of this, the confer
ence of representatives of the
Scandinavian countries and
Switzerland at Copenhagen this
month, is said here to be of
great significance. Spain and
Holland may also send dele
gates. Actual peace terms arc ness
important now thun the neces
sity of getting a conference.
German officials said today.
Any terms which may be sug
gested now, would simply be

FORWARD PROPOSALS
Treading On Ticklish Ground In Going Any Further Than
This Until Allies Are Heard From-Must Know Whether
They Are Willing to Discuss Peace Before Tendering
Good Offices-High Officials Feel Allies Not Ready to
Talk Peace
By Carl D. Groat,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
I Washington, Dec. 13. What part the United States
will play in furthering Germany's suggestion for peace
is undetermined today.
But these three big ideas toward it are in official minds:
That England and her allies should at least discuss the
offers.
That any settlement, especially in Germany's present
frame of mind, would have to be backed by a world
guaranty of peace.
That the United States will not be stampeded in the
peace movement.
On the whole, the sentiment here is at present the
United States ought merely to act as messenger for Ger
many and pass on her proposals.
President Wilson is undecided; he has not even- told
his cabinet what he thinks. But his closest followers be
lieve that this nation ought to know what the allies think
of the offer before making any move.
Futhermore, they say frankly they believe England
will scorn the offer; especially if based on the terms an
nounced by a German embassy official.
In these circumstances, America's course must be cau-
tious, officials hold.
The United Press obtained its information today from
four of the best informed men in close touch with the ad
ministration. Its main informant was one of the fore
most men in the councils and confidence of President
Wilson.
Requires Consideration.
From him came the statement that
anything purporting to be President
Wilson's idea now is a fiction.
The piesident, he said, has not even
confided to his cabinet what he plans,
and, indeed, has not yet. But the of
ficial view, us reflected by Wilson's
closost advisers, can be stated thus:
On the first point, the administration
regards the question of peace as so bin
that it must be given serious considera
tion. On the other hand, it feels convinced
already that the allies will acorn the
off.ers. But be Germany's motive, po
litical, altruistic or greedy, the idea of a
step to end the war is too momentous
o be cast aside without fullest official
discussion.
In these circumstances, the govern
ment mny lend its influence,secrctly
perhaps 10 getting such discussion.
But it will go cautiously before put
ting itself on public record behind Ger
many's proffer, until it knows accurate
ly whether there can be the slightest
chance of success.
While the administration feels certain
that England will not now accept Ger
many's proposals as outlined, it at-
taches trrent importance to the fact that
these proposals may form the "entering
wedge" for peace "or peace parleys.

May Start Discussion.
Inasmuch as this officially starts the
j ball rolling, it is considered a vital prop
position thought destined to full for the
moment.
Colonel House, the president's per
il sonal adviser, is with him today, helping
him with his knowledge concerning
peace thoughts in Europe, gleaned from
: iourneyings us Wilson's private envoy.
He will play a large part in the determ
ination. Meantime others closo to the presi
dent are anxious that he take a big,
firm stand tor peace, backing Ger
many's idea not ns Germany's idea
but as a means to stop a monstrous
slaughter.
The idea of such a part has been pre-
lsented frequently to the president.
Earlv this forenoon the official text
I . . . rt i . .
or tne oterman ponce proposal nun
arrived at the state department.
On the question of a world guaranty
of peace, officials think that Germany
terms ns revealed by a German embassy
official are such that only an interna
tional agreement could make them
"stick". And, at this time, they feel
it Is doubtful if such a guaranty could
be effected.
Guaranty of World Peace.
The reasons for desiring a world
guaranty are these:
Germany would be well pleased to re
turn to the status she had territorially
before the war. But, in addition, she
wants a way into Asia Minor. Her terms
impose a hardship upon Russia because
she wants a buffer between that great
nation and her eastern boundary. But
CAN ONLY
I such terms could not be attained, prou-
aoiy.
Hence, right on that point, the neci
of a world guaranty of peace woul.
arise.
Belgium would be restored, but at a
terrible sacrifice. There would be no
restitution for the ravages of war, un
less, perhaps, Germany should buy, at
an enormous rate, the Belgian Congo
as a restitution meusure.
Belgium ' fate in the present war, of
ficials think, makes the idea of a work!
guaranty of peace even more essential
than perhaps do the questions of a poa
sible threat of Russia overrunning tho
German empire.
Germany has aspirations in Asia Min
or. That ia why she leaves the settle
ment of Balkan problems, to the peace
Conference. All hef terms suggest the
need of a world guaranty, said tho Uni
ted I'ress' informant, and he doubted
that this will be possible at this time.
Will Not Send House.
Washington, Dec. 13 The administra
tion does not plan to send Colonel
House, President Wilson's personal ad
visor, abroad to do anything about the
German peace move.
