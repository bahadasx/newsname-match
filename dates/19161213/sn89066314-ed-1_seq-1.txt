LONDON." Dec. 13. The British peo-
pie have already answered Germany s
olfer of peace "No, on such a basis as
proposed." The answer was perfect
ly apparent today. It was reflected in
newspaper comment; it was reflected
In conversation of the people on the

day will be Lloyd-George's first ap

Germany's idea of her victories.

On the whole, the sentiment here is

President Wilson is undecided. He
has not even told his Cabinet what

thermore, they say frankly that- they,
believe England will scorn the offer,

In these circumstances, the Gov

The official view as reflected by

convinced already that the Allies will

BERLIN, Dec. 13. Germany has
not asked the neutral powers to seek
peace csotiatlons. The American
ambassador's understanding is that
Germany has merely asked the neu
tral powers to inform the nations of
the' Entente, that theCentral Powers
are willing to discuss peace, putting
up to the Allies the acceptance or re
fusal of the tender.
The diplomatic corps here general

requested, to send the message to Bel

representative was asked to forward

If Germany's bid tor peace is re

Central Powers will not again take the
initiative to end the war. "The public
today voiced complete approbation of

The most exciting basketball game
ever played on the Rothwell Gymnas

the last contest between "the Missouri
and Nebraska quintets. This was in
1911. Missouri won the game by a
one-point margin, the score being
39-38.
It took two extra periods to decide
the result, as the game was a tie at
the end 'of the regulation time,, j Both
teams agreed to play an extra five
minutes. At the end ot this period
each team had scored four polnts;o
an additional period of five .minutes
was added. With ten seconds to play,
Nebraska was leading the Tigers by
one point. Just before the whistle
blew H. B. Cohen, Tiger captain and
forward, threw a field goal from near
the sideline, wining the game;
