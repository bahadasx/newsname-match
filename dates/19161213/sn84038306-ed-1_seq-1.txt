Mr. Holbert suffered a slight stroke
of paralysis in April of this year. Af
ter a few weeks of careful treatment
his aoadltion was vary much improv
ed' aid he was able to give his time
aad attention to his affairs as usual.
He did not however apply himself
so closely to his business as former
ly but gave much of his time ia the
interest of various organizations of
which he was a member. Politics

not yet been decided by the family
whether interment will be made here
or at Greeley.
"Mr. Holbert lived in Delaware
'county practically all of his life. He
was born in Luzerne county, Pa., on
September 29th, 1853, and came here
with his parents soon after. They lo
cated near Colesburg and it was in
that vicinity that he grew to manhood.
He received his education in the
schools of this county and Lenox col
lege. He early became interested, in
thoroughbred stock and his^tttfintipp
soon became directed to the handling
of imported horses. He imported
many thousand horses to this country
from France and Belgium and his
stables had a nation wide reputation.
His animals have taken scores of priz
es at the stock expositions of recent
-years. It will be remembered that
because of his personal acquaintance
with high German officials the horses
which the German government'sent to
the World's fair &\ Chicago were in
trusted to his supervision. His, keen
a£d discerning Judgment and untiring
energy brought him success and
placed him at the head of the horse
importers of America. Starting with
little capital bqtwlth willing hands
and a clear .mind he acumulated a
fortune far ^exceeding a million dol
lars. He was accounted the wealthiest
man in Delaware county at the time
of his death.
On February 2, 1881, he married
BtDaa D. Baker. He often said his
success was in a large measure due
to her business Judgment qpd active
co-operation during years
cii^Wa'very buay.tfto
^Is sarvixad his wife and the

A'
Louis, and Marjorie. Three sisters,
«T!**Mrs- H. A. Dittmer of this city, Mrs.
Carpenter of Arlington and
Mra. Charles Sawyer of Pomona, Cal
ifornia, also survive Mr. Holbert.
The death of Ben. Holbert, as he
was familiarly known, marks the
P*88'11* of a man whose restless en
pp ergy would have brought success In
%, ahy line he might have-chosen. He
was a genial companion and always
had a. cheering'wOrd for his friends.
He was a frequent visitor in Manches
ter and enjoyed a very large circle
of close friends here who deeply
mourn his death. Mr. Holbert was a
public spirited man. When some new
'4^ project was launched or some worthy
cause needed assistance he was al
ways one of the first to generously
respond. He was naturally a broad
and liberal minded man by nature
hopeful and optomlstic.
In his death this iounty and the
state loses a leading citizen and this
community a good friend. The mem

INCREASES LIBRARY.
The library In the local High school
has been greatly increased this year
and now will come close to excelling
any collection of books of thei rkind
in the state. Of special interest is a
set of history (English) published in
the latter part of the seventeenth
century .While these books are not
especially designed for reference at
this period, they are nevertheless very
valuable as woVks of art. The print
ing contained within is exceptional
and all of the books in the set are
profusely illustrated with wood en
gravings which are seldom seen in
modern times. The set is the gift of
Judge E. P. Sedds, who kindly donated
the books some time ago.

turned in catf&Ho the county $2,394.11,
but this money was all expended for

As the average number of inmates
of the institution was less than 21,
it may be ascertained'that each in

has been suggested that it would be
more profitable to sell the farm and

INVE8TI6ATING THE FACTS.
In their investigadon of local con
dition* the United Charities commit
tee has discovered sophe interesting
facts regarding poor Relief in Dela
ware county. From tile financial re
port of the county for 1915 they find
that the Couptjr Treasurer p^id out
ot the poor.vr'eM?f fund $18,027:: 91
««{:rom''$i relief fund, $2^258.^
00 for county patients at the hospi
tal at Independence^ $6,642.62: for
soldiers' orphans at 'fiigyenport *515.
11 tor feeblo at
waB
Been
that about $1.50
for each man, woman and child in
the county was expended for poor
relief in one form or another.
County Auditor C. H. Bunker, states
that the number of individuals receiv
ing aid from the poor fund is sp
proxiinatcly 250.
In spite of tMs seemingly large
sum. of money raised by taxation
which is being spent yearly for poor
relief, it is a matter of common
knowledge that worthy persons are
suffering for lack of proper food and
clothing, and the various organiza
tions which have united to form the
United Charities expect to continue
their investigations and perfect an
organization which stall secure .bet
ter results from ths txpenditore of
county funds as well at from private
contributions.
With this purpose ladies represent
ing ten societies at the city, with
the assistance of a committee from
the Commercial club, will conduct a
Community census with the purpose
of finding every family that needs
help and every person who will give
help of any kind. The fundamental
Idea is to avoid chairty but to give
work suited to the ability of the per
son "needing aid and to assist such
persons to secure permanent em
ployment which will lift them out of
the class of persons needing assist-
In view of the general high pric
es and great need for substantial
relief, the idea of a Community Christ
mas Tree will probably be abandon
ed, but the Commercial club is plan
ning to distribute baskets of food to
those who need and would appreci
ate such a Christmas gilt.

BOOST FOR THE HOME TEAM.
The basket ball season for 1916-'l7
has opened with a grand rush, and
promises to be one of the most suc
cessful in many years. Manchester
Is represented on the floor by an ex
tra fast team, probably the best the
city has ever had for some time. The
team IS composed ot Paul Klaus, Eph
rlam Cloud. Cecil Dutton, W. Dutton,
Robert Barr, John Wood, and Basil
Confare.
Already the bogs have shown their
ability by winning all ot the games
whlph they have played up to this
time, capturing two victories from the
Masonville sir-footers, and one from
the fast Eerlville Ave. The first game
waB played at Masonville, and was
easily won by a score of 43 to 9.
The game here with Masonville was
also-won by the home boys, the score
being 57 to 27. Last Friday night the
team went to Earlville, where they
had a little stiffer opposition, but in
spite of the loss of Ephriam Cloud,
they carried off the honors, winning
by a score of 29 to 23.
The next game is to be played Fri
day night at Hopklnton against Len
or College, and probably will be the
hardest fought game of the season.
Tuesday, December 19th the boys will
play Edgewood, here at the High
school gymnasium, the game to be
called at 8:15, so as to give everyone

CO. H. TO RETURN HOME.
The First Iowa infantry, which in
clude* Co. H, the Manchester com
pany, has been designated by General
Funston to return home. It will be a
few days before the regiment will be
ready to move northward, and the
journey and mustering out at Des
Moines will take more time but the
good fortune of Christmas dinner at
home is in store for the members of
the Manchester company. They
should be given a rousing reception
upon their homecoming. The boys
will be glad to return home and the
community will give them a hearty
welcome. The practical experiences
of six months ln.camp has been very
valuable training to them and the
company has attained a high state of
efficiency. They may well feel thank
ful that the steady hand of our govern
ment makes it possible for every man
to return in good health and without
the scars of an unnecessary Mexican
war.
The members of tho Manchester
company were ordered to assemble on
June 20th, 1916, and left here for
Des Moines on June 24th. They were
at Camp Dodge until July 25th,when
they left for Brownsville, Texas,
where they have been stationed up to
the present time. The First Iowa in
fantry and the First battalion Iowa
field artillery are the only Iowa troops
included in the recent order. Nothing
is known as to the intentions of the
department in regard to releasing the
Second and Third Iowa regiments.
There are 1,100 men in the First

VISIT LOOK OUT MOUNTAIN.
On their trip to Florida last month
Mr. and Mrs. A. H. Blake stopped at
Chattanooga long enough to go to
the top of Lookout Mountain on the
side of which General Hooker fought
a battle above the clouds.
Wo glean tho» following Interesting
extracts from a personal letter writ

"On the afternoon ot November 7th
we made the auto trip to Lookout
Mountain, Chattanooga. Tenn., It is
about five miles from the city to the
foot of the mountain and seven miles
from there to the top of the moun

is 2,340 feet above the sea level and
1,760 feet abov* the city. In climb
