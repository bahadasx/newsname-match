through Great Wallachia, Rumania's
richest province. Mizil, on the rail
way line between Ploschti and Buzeu,
forty-three miles northeast of Bu
charest, and Urzlechenl, twenty miles
southeast of Mizil, were captured by
the Austro-Germans, according to the
Berlin official statement.
The German report says also that
the Ninth Army, which wrested these
towns fiom their defenders, has taken
more than 10,000 Rumanians prison
ers In the last three days, together
with several cannon and quantities of
field material.
To all appearances the Rumanians
are manoeuvring their forces as best
they can in the face of tremendous
opposition, with a view to taking up a
defensive line along the Ruzeu River,
near the southern boundary of Molda

Featherweight Boxer Hopes to Put on
Bouts in Bennington.

one of the star performers at the
bouts held by the Western Gateway
Athletic club of North Adams in re

In action at the Canadian club rooms
here on several occasions, Is now lo

I Rosch has been boxing for six
years and during that period has ap
peared in the souarod circle on no
less than 49 different occasions. Dur-
, ing the early portion of his ring ca
reer his bookings were in the prelimi
nary classes but in recent years he ,
has been In the main attraction. In
the 49 bouts he has been awarded a
draw, been given the decision or has
disposed of his opponent by the K. O.
route in all but four. A sprained
ankle lost him one decision to Young
Joslc, a North Adams .boxer who Is
well-known In Benningtone. He waa
bnaten early in his career by Kid
Shea at New Haven and lost a bout
to Joe Morgan at Manchester, N. H.,
in April, 1914; but the only boxer
who succeeded In putting him away
with the sleep wallop was Pete Hart

Is exceptionally fast on his feet, has
a wicked punch in both hands with
the strength to carry It through and
Is a clever boxer. A badly sprained
ankle kept him out of the game when
he needed the experience and training
but the more serious drawback was a
broken jaw received when he boxed
Holnz Orchard, the champion of the
United States navy at Newport, R. I.
The blow which broke Rosch's jaw
was delievered in the opening round
but the little scrapper remained In
the ring and was awarded a draw by
the referee.
Several years ago when "Young"

wrestler hold a number of exhibitions
at tho rooms of the Canadian club,
Rosch wa3 put on In a number of
preliminary four-round bouts In which
he was conceded to have had the bet
ter of his opponents. He boxed here
with "Young" Josie of North Adams
and Kid Black of New. York. No de
cision was given but In the second
bout, Rosi:h was by far tho better
man. His last appearance here was
when he disposed of Battling Johnson
of Albany in four rounds.
Since coming to Bennington Rosch
has boon working out of doors rind is
in good condition. He would require
but little training to fit him for the
ring. Any ambitious featherweight
who Is anxious to make a match will
flud- him both ready and willing.

The propi dtlons which they will

appropriate basis for tho : establish-1

"The four allied powers have been
obliged to take up arms to defend Jus
tlee and the liberty of national evolu
tion. The glorious deeds of our arm- j
les have in no way altered their pur- :
pose. We always maintained the firm
beilief that our own rights and justi

rights of these nations.
"The spiritual and material pro
gress which were the pride of Europe
at the beginning of the twentieth cen
tury are threatened with ruin. Ger
many and her allies, Austria-Hungary.
Bulgaria, and Turkey, gave
proof of their unconquerable strength
in this struggle. They gained gigan
tio advantages over adversaries su

Our lines Bland unshaken against
ever-repeated attempts made by arm
led. "Tho last attack In the Balkans has
been rapidly and victoriously over
come. Tho most recent events have
demonstrated that further continu
ance of the war will not result In
breaking tho resistance of our forces,
and the whole situation with regard
to our troops justifies our expectation
of further successes.
"If, in spite of this offer of peace
and reconciliation, tho struggle
should go on, tho four allied powers
are resolved to continue to a victor

Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
in his speech to the Reichstag said
that Germany, together with her al
lies, "conscious of their responsibility
before God, before their own nations,
before humanity," had proposed this
morning to the hostile Powers to en
ter on peace negotiations.
The Chancellor then read the text
of the note to the neutral countries
and continued:
"Gentlemen, in August, 1914, our
enemies challenged the superiority of
power in the world war.' Today wo
raise the question of poace, which Is
a question of humanity. We await
tho answer of our enemies with that
sereneness of mind which Is guaran
teed to us by our exterior and interior
strength and by our clear conscience.
If our enemies decline to end the war.
if they wish to take upon themselves
the world's heavy burden of all these
terrors which hereafter will
nerearier win ionow,
then even in the last and smallest
homes every German heart will burn
in sacred wrath against our enemies
Who are unwilling to stop human
slaughter in order that their plans of
conquest and annihilation may continue."

FIGHT AGAINST OPPRESSION
People Of Eastern Europe Want Help
From U. S.
Washington, Dec. 11. Causes of
tho various European peoples sub
merged by political or military pow
er were championed today by speak
ers btfore the conference of op-
' Pressed or dependent nationalities,
f Tho &vow of the con.
purpose of the confer
ence Is to plan for development of an
American international policy toward
oppressed or dependent nationalities
through their representatives in
America.
The speakers voiced appeals in be
half of the Albanians, Armenians, Syr
ians, Russian Jews, Croatians, Letts,
Lithuanians, Poles, Ukrainians, Slavs
Bohemians aud Finns. Virtually every
representative went into the histori
cal details of the trials to which his,
or her particular people had been sul
Jected, made a plea for political Inde
pendence and urged that the influence
of the United States be used at the
conclusion of the war in tho Interest
of oppressed humanity.
Speaking for the Poles. Dr. Kasimir
A. Ztirawekl, Loyola university, Chi
cago, member of the Polish National
Defense committee, assailed Russia
for treatment accorded Poles, declar
ing that permanent peace, in Europe
in possible only as the result of the
failure of Russian and English imper
ialism and consequent freedom of the
nations oppressed by these two pow
ers." Dr. ZuraskI gave as his opinion
"neutral nations will have very little
If any influence on the peace negotia
tions unless they are prepared to de
fend by force International agree
ments." He assailed Great Britain and Rus
sia for "opposing the desire of Ameri
ca to give aid to starving Poland on
the ground that the Germans were
iequlsitioning foodstulfs thcTe." say
ing that the "same governments free
ly permit the imortatlon of food
from America into northern France,
knowing all the time that requisitions
are being made there." The object
of the Polish nation, he added, is to
unite "Into one Polish state all of its
ports."
Mlrostav Sichinsky of New York,
member of the Ukrainian Federation
of tho United States, said that Amer
ca could not solve the problems of
tho Krainians and that they must be
settled on the battlefield.

PROBLEM FOR PRESIDENT
Majority Opinion of Congress Opposed
to Active Participation at
Present Time.
Washington, Dec. 12. Out of tho
gloom caused by the continuance of
the devastating war In Europe ha3
come the first real ray of hope in the
peace proposals made to-day in the
Reichstag by Chancellor Von Bethmann-Hollweg,
and communicated
through neutral Goverments to the
enemies of the Central Powers.
Regardless of whether or not Ger
many's proposal is acceptable and
nobody believey it will be in its pres
ent form the feeling In, official cir
cles in Washington is one of hope
that this may be the entering wedge
for discussion of peace. It is realized
that this is a matter for the Presi
dent solely to deal with. Not until
he knows the exact nature of the com
munication can he decide upon the
course to follow in what Is generally
recognized as an extremely delicate
situation. The only statement forth
coming tonight from the White House
was that the President was giving
the most serious consideration to 'the
method to be pursued.
As to the wisdom and property of
any action by this Government beyond
that of merely forwarding the German
proposal, tho opinion of members of
Congress is divided. The preponder
ance of sentiment, if anything, ap
pears to be against it. The general
disposition of mein!ers of the Foreign
Relations Committees of both houses
was to look upon the peace proposal.
as reported in press despatches, as
ui-o'uablT, .. fruitless. Some senators
were of the opinion that any move by
the President at this time would bo
ill advised. Others, however, believed
that the Iresldent would be justified
and pointed to the action taken by
President Roosevelt and the results
the flowed from it.
RAISING GLADIOLI BULBS
Good Crop Secured at Famous Cowee
Farm at Berlin.
Assemblyman Cowee of Berlin is a
firm believer in free trade-rfor the
other fellow. As everybody knows he
is one of tho largest growers of gla
dioli in the United States, and his
pretty farm at Berlin Is famous the
world over. Under a protective tar
iff it was his custom to Increase an
nually the acreage dovoted to the cul
ture of his pretty product, but this
year he does not intend doing so: he
has enough just as present.
"Fortunately for me", ho Eaid, "the
year has been a fine one for this
part of the country and a bad ono for
Holland and for the West, where ex
tensive gladioli farms are located, and
I expect to do a large business In
bulbs. The cut-flower trade is small
and does not count. .The bulk of my
business is In the sale of bulbs. At
present, undcr. the no-duty policy of
our government, Holland can dump
her goods in on this country ad lib.
We can compete with them easily as
far as natural conditions are con
cerned, for our ground is more fertile,
but we are entiroly outclassed when
It comes to tho matter of labor. How
can you meet competition when you
have to pay from $9 to $15 i week for
labor, and it is very scarce at that,
when Holland's highest-priced work
men receive only $7.50 at the most?
Tho average is $4.50. I believe iu
protection, but only a protection
which will equalize labor conditions.
The West is a strong competitor, but I
our soil is better adapted to the cul-1
ture of gladioli, and we ore about
equal as regards the price of labor."
Mr. Cowee related a narrow escape
that ho had from a big crop damage.
Just previous to the last cold snap he
had completely harvested his crop of
bulbs and housed them. Otherwise he
would not have been able to have got
ten tho bulbs out of the ground for
some time, and then all of tho bulbs
would have been wet and soggy. "The
damage would not, however, have i
been as great as it might otherwise
have been, as we harvest our most ex
pensive stock first; the cheaper
grades afterward, but - still tho loss
would have been considerable. Mr.
Cowee confidently looks forward to
a good year this coming season.

COTTAGE WRECKERS CAUGHT
Young Men and Young Girls Admit
Breaking into Woodford Camp.
The local police did not experience
much difficulty iu putting their hands
on the vandals who broke into Miss
Harriet Twitehell's cottage at Wood
ford Hollow last Saturday night and
wrecked tho interior of the building.
By making inquires the officers
learned that two couples, two well
known young men and two girls less
than 20 years of age, secured a horse
and wagon on Saturday and the rest
was comparatively easy., AH four at
first denied that they were guilty but
when confronted with tho evidence,
some of which consisted of chicken
feathers " stripped from the birds
which went Into the 'banquet at the
camp, they owned up and made a
full confession. '
Inasmuch aa Miss Twltclrell is not
anxious that criminal proceedings be
brought against the quartet, provided
a settlement Is made for the damage,
tho alleged culprits, may not be
brought into court. If they escape
without being prosecuted they will
have reason to consider themselves
lucky. It is believed that had there
not been more or less liquor used at
the camp the destruction of property
would not have occurred.
KAISER INFORMS HIS TROOPS

Whether it will be accepted is still
uncertain.
"Until that moment arrives you will

Emperor William's order to his com

to "my navy, which in the common
flight has loyally and effectively
staked all Its strength."
