AN ENORMOUS QUESTION
President Wllaon Has Made
Plans, Nor Expressed an Opinion
as to What Will
Be Done.
[By Carl D. Groat, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13—What part
the United States will play in further
ing Germany's suggestion for peace is
undetermined today.
But these three big ideas toward it
are in official minds:
That England and her allies
should at least discuss the offers.
That any settlement, especially
in Germany's frame of mind would
have to be backed by a world gua
ranty of peace.
That the United States will not
be stampeded in the peace move
ment.
On the whole the sentiment here Is
that at present the United States
ought, merely to act as messenger for
Germany and pass on her proposals.
President Wilson is undecided he
has not even told his cabinet what he
fore making ariy move. Furthermore
they say frankly they believe England
will scorn the offer especially if based
on the terms announced by a German
embassy official.
In these circumstances America's
course must be cautious, officials hold.
The United Press obtained its infor
mation today from four™ the best in
formed men in close touch with the ad
ministration. Its main informant was

On the first point, the administration

motive, political. altrufRtie or Kreedy,
the idea of a step to end the war is too
momentous to be cast aside without

NETW YORK, Dec. 13.—So anxious

accommodate them. Hundreds of sales
it was learned today go by the boards
simply because the wireB cannot carry

Yesterday when Germany's peace

So furious is the trading on the stock

'sometimes are eighteen minutes be

and the tickers frequently lag five or

In the open windows of the curb
brokerage houses, one today could see
girls making the wild, mystio signals
to the traders on the pavement, that
never before were made by feminine
fingers. The supply of brokerage em

And lambs are so plentiful that a

(R. T. Halsey, chairman of the finance
committee of the stock exchange when
iasked today for an explanation of the
six two million share days and the
I twenty-one one million share days on

"The people of^the west, are trading
in New York stocks in a way none of'
us ever saw before. They have money
as the result of the big prices for crops "t
jand they are making more of it here,
many of them. The good cotton prices
'likewise have put the people of the I
south into the market. They are new

William C. VanAntwerp, governor of
the stock exchange agreed, explaining
that the people in remote sections are
trading by wire in the stocks of con
cerns they know. Utah copper, Texas
oil and Montana power stocks, he said
bring orders from their respective
states in large numbers.
"But the influence of the foregin
business is more significant to my
mind," he said. "South Americans are

If German Pe^ce Proposal is

DID NOT EXPECT MUCK
The 'public today voiced complete
approbation of the Imperial chancel
lor's solemn warning in the relch
stag yesterday that if Germany's ehe
mles continue the war, it is because
they have conquest in mind. Such
a belief imbues the general public
with an inflexible deteraaination to
fight on to the bitter end against
any diamembarmept ot' the .father-,
land.
The hopes of the German people
are whole-hearted, but if the present
proposal is scorned, the rejection of
the plan for a discussion of terucs
would serve to cement the empire
more fully in its determination and
to dispell peace talk and speculation,
which has been current.
Berlin newspapers were not san
guine today that the peace offer
would be accepted, although applaud

ment of Editor Theodore Wolff of
the Tageblatt is typical:
"If the opposing allies should de
cline peace overtures or disdain them
as a sign of weakness and sutiering,
the people will once more ask them
selves whether thoy are not being:
driven senselessly and without urgent
need to new sacrifices and renewed
massacres.
"The German people, If their oppo
nents answer in the negative, will
see clearly it is their duty to bear
the heavy burden or heavier bur
dens, so long as there is no possi
bility of agreeing upon an acceptable
and sensible peace."
