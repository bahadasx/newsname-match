OFFICIAL TEXT IS AWAITED
Wilson Expected to Make Final

lo attend the dinner given by the Pres
ident to members or his Cabinet. At
the request or the President he lis re
mained over, and during the morning
he was engaged In conferences with Mr.
Wilson and with Becretary or Klate
learning.
Thus rar the official text of the pence
offer has not been received, owing, no
doubt, to the delays encountered In re
laying It from point to point. It Is
expected that it will arrive sometime
-jxlay and that It will be followed by
the Identic notes from Austria-Hungary,

Opinion In official circles Is widely
divergent as to the probable course
lo be pursued by President Wilson.
At the White House and Htt De

dent cannot definitely shape his de

than transmit th communication
rrom the rentrnl powers to the en

officials see It. would be to Invito the
embarrassing consequences of a re

In these quarters It Is pointed out
that It would e extremely hatardous
for the United Utates to place Itself
In the position of championing the
proffer of Germany and her allies
without a definite Indication rrom the
other side that such an attitude would
be acceptable.
To Aid Cauao of Poaeo.
Regardless or the,e considerations,
however, there Is a widespread reeling
among Administration officials that
the Prealdent will not miss what may
be the last opartunlty In a long time
to put In a word for peace.

kind, either through the medium of a

The central power are counting
upon neutral or the world to play an
Important part In Influencing the
entente allies to accept their peace
terms. It was declared at the German
embassy today.
Whatever peace terms are suggeU
ed now might perhaps be Interpreted
"as what Germany would like to .ret.
not what -eiie expect to get," It uiu'i
aaia.
In view or this, the conference of
representatives of the Scandinavian
countries and Switzerland at Copen
hagen this month Is considered here
to be or great significance, Spain
and Holland may also send delegates.
Actual peace terms are less Import
ant now than the necessity or getting
a conference, German official ssld
today. Any terms which may be sug-
fested now would simply be "talking

peace terms, officials pointed out,
could only be evolved after a long

BRITISH PEOPLE REFUSE
Oermana Proposal Already Ani-j..
we red by Public.
LONDON. Dec. 13. Tho British pe
pl have already answered Germany'
offer or peace "No. not on such a
berls as proposed."
That answer was perfectly apparent
today. It waa reflected not only In tk
newspaper commend, but In expres
sions from th people on the streets.
Look to New Premier.
The nation look to Lloyd-Gecrgo
next Tuesday to frame thla answer.
It cannot be a direct reply, since It
U hardly expected England's consulta
tion with her allies over what form
th. diplomatic answer shall be, can be
concluded that soon.
Rut Tuesday w.111 be Lloyd-George's
flrst appearance as premier berore the
House or Commons nc berore news
or the German proposal came, he had
been announced aa ready to outline on
that date the alms and purpose 'or
the new cabinet.
To Voice Rejection.
Press and public alike look to
Lloyd-George on this occasion to voice
the nation's rejection of any peace
which la based on Germany's Idea or
victory.
Germany'a peace terms, aa given out
by a German embasay official In
Washington, wore generally regarded
a preposterous and unworthy of ser
ious consideration here.
Indicate Attitude.
Lloyd George' telegram to Premier
Rrland, or Krunce. together with the
former's recent Interview granted (he
United Press, portions of which were
liberally reproduced in the British
press today, wore considered Indica
tive of Britain' attitude toward von
Bethmann-Hollweg.
The only keynote or difference ob
servable In editorial comment today
was whether the allies. In their reply
to tho German note, -should set. forth
therein their own term upon which
peace discussion would be considered.
Will Be Rejected. .
If the practical unanimity .or opin
ion or the press and public means any
thing, the reply will be rejected.
Press comment ranged today all the
way rrom the Dally Mall's suggestion
that von Rethmann-Hollweg la "no
more entitled to the courtesy 'or a re
ply than an armed burglar in a pri
vate house," to that made by the Man
chester Guardian that negotiation
should at least go as far a to ascer
tain Germany's exact terms.
' Would Be Direct.
A number of newspaper, point out,
the desirability In view of the manner
In which Germany made her offer, that
tho allies In replying, clearly enunciate
their own alms In the war, for the
benefit of the w (lid's opinion: that the
terms on which the allies are willing
to enter peace negotiations be clearly
set forth. Such comment holds that
only In this way ran responsibility for
tho continuance of the war which re-
aponslblllty Germany obviously seek to
