CITY ELECTION.
Election Friday and Only One Ticket in
the Field Instead of Two as
Usual
The city election will be held Friday
of this week, at which time there will
be elected a mayor, four aldermen and
a member ot the city school board.
Last week there was considerable
agitation over the fact that the ticket
proposed was all republicans. The
democrats tried for several days to
formulate a mixed ticket with whicn
they could hope to win over the ticket
the republicans were putting out, but
for reason best known to those behind
the movement, no second ticket was
put out and the coming election will
be a Walkover for the ticket named.
Some persons attempted to make it
appear that the tight was on Marshal
Lowery, but that was not the case in
the sense that they sought to make it
appear. Marshal Lowrey has made a
must excellent utiicer and so far as we
are aware there is not a single law
abiding citizen in town who is opposed
to Mr. Lowery as an individual or
because he has failed to discharge his
duty. Some persons do feel, however,
that the salary of $85 a month that is
now being paid him is very heavy for
the resources oi our town. They think
order can be maintained for much less
money-$600 to $700.
At the same time there is quite a
number of good citizens who teel that
Mr. Lowery shuuld be retained as
marshal. They seem to feel that Cross
ville will soon return to the same dis
orderly condition it was in betore Mr.
Lowey came, if he is removed as mar
afaal. Marsl at Hill Lowery came here
when the town was infested with boot
leggers and when it was common for
so many drunk or drinking men to be
on the streets, especially on Saturday,
that ladies were liable to be insulted
while passing from one business house
to anotner. Marshal Lowery notified
the people when ne came to serve as
marshal that he would clean op Cross
ville, provided the law-abiding people
would support him. The law-abiding
people have stood with him and he has
fulfilled his promise to the letter.
Crossville is a model town for order
and quietness now and that condition
is due to the vigorous action ol Mar
shal Lowery against all otfendors, re
agrdless of who they were.
So far as the work of Mr. Lowery
goes we feel that it is hard tospeak
of him in too high terms. The only
question as we see it is, must we
pay any man $85 a month or any where
near that amount to police our town?
Many think it wise to give a cheaper
man a trial and if it develops that we
must pay a heavy price to maintain
order, pay that price, be it what it
may.
We do not pretend to know nor say
whether or not Marshal Hill Lowery
will be retained as marshal by the in
coning board. We are only stating the
Views of some number of as good citi
zens as we have.
What the incoming board will do no
one can say, but we feel sure they will
act with honesty of purpose and with
a desire to do the best possible for our
town, be their action what it may.
The ticket to be voted for Friday is
as follows :

A tew days ago an artc' appeared
In a Michigan paper advising people
to go out in the country near there,
where land is $200 per acre, buy a few
acres anil raise potatoes. Now our
local markets are paying just the same
for potatoes as the price quoted in the
article mentioned ; and the land wnieh
pells for $S?00 up there is no better than
that which can be bought here for $11).
Does any other part of the country
offer one so great an opportunity as
does the Cumberland Plateau?
The writer wishes that every raader
of the Chronicle would join those who
have taken a firm stanl against the
killing ot doves, and other birds that
are seen in less numbers through here
every year. It is a crime against na
ture to destroy her beautiful little
messengers nntil the woods no longer
resound with the music of their calls.
Especially does it seem a crime for
their lives no longer to be safe here
in the very heart of nature, where they
should be so plentiful. The hunter
who destroys innocent life just for the
joy of killing; or the man who is small
enough to want the doves and other
song birds killed because ot the hano
iul of food they may glean from his
farm during the summer months should
go out in the shed and hang himself

There seems to be a widespread de
termination on the part of the people
to not feast on turkey for Christmas
unless the price is less than was asked
for lhanksgiving. The prices were
excessively high and it is no surprise
that the people feel the necessity of
economizing on that luxury in the
face of the extremely high prices of
practically everything one has to use.
Old soldiers have answered the call
to the number of 50,000 the past year
and the amount paid for pensions has
been reduced $6,000,000. The lines of

A HELPIN6 HAND.
Extended by "A Friend" to the Suffering
Thousands In Europe.
Grassy Cove, Tenn., Dec. 11, 1916.
Dear Mr. Bishop: In last issue of
the Chonicle 1 read the heart rending
account ot the suffering in the war
zone.
Isn't it tenble to think of the chil
dren simply starving and freezing just
across the water, while here we are
thinking ot what we can get to make
Christmas more pleasant for our own
little ones? Oh, let us be thankful to
the one whose birth we are about to
celebrate for all these things and give
of our store, however small, to aid
these little ones, remembering that in
so doing we are giving to some
0f
Christ's children and fulfilling his
words, "Insomuch as you have given
to one of the least of these, you have
given unto me. "
I am sending $1.00, Mr. Bishop,
asking you to please drop it into the
postoffice relief box for me. I only
wish 1 could multiply it a thousand
times.
A Friend.
(It is scarcely necessary for us to
say that the above letter was written
by a Christian mother tor the mother's
love is plainly pulsing in e very line. It
is not for us to thank this good woman
for this timely aid, tor thanks more
fervent than any we could offer will
go up from a thousand hearts in the
stricken regions oi Europe and the
joy in her own heart at the opportunity
to help suffering humanity, is to this
woman a rich reward for wh it slie has
done. The fuct that this giver with
holds her name is the strongest assur
ance that the gift is gladly bestowed.

Bird That Dances.
There is a bird in the Irirdhouse of !
New York Zoological purk that is a
bird of a dancer. He can do all the j
modern dances. His name is Cock- j
of-the-Rock, or the rupicola cotlngldae.
He is a most peculiar bird. His aim
less leaping about meant next to noth
ing to the casual observers, who j
thought that the floor of the cage pos
sibly might have become too hot for
his feet. But to Keeper Stacey the
same antics conveyed a message of
loneliness. "You see, Cock-of-the-Rock 1
birds," explained the keeper, "like to
dance. Down in British Guiana, where
this fellow comes from, the birds gath
er and dance in a big circle. This bird
likes to think that he is home and so
dances around, taking the part of the j
whole bunch. After he has danced
around in a big circle he thinks he's a
whole flock of birds." The Cock-of-the-Rock
is a rare bird, with beautiful red
and crane plumage. Unlike most birds
of this color, he has not faded to any
noticeable extent since being made a
captive.
