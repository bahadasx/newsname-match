GERMANY ADDS
ULTIMATUM TO
PEACEPROPOSAL
Refusal of Handshake To Be
Followed by Mailed Fist.
llerlin Not Sanguine That Allies
Will Accept.
IT'S PEACE OR "WAR TO HILT"
Iteady to Convince Enemy Offer
ot Siern of Weakness.
Reichstag Adjourns, Leaving
Government a Free Hand.
Berlin. Dec. 13. If Germany's bid
for peace is rejected by the entente
powers, it is certain the central em
pires will not take the initiative again
to end the war.
The public today voiced complete
approbation of the imperial chancel
lor" pnlemn warning in the reichstag
yesterday that if Germany's enemies
continue the war. it is because they
have conquest in mind. Such a belief
imbues the general public with an in
flexible determination to fight on to
the bitter end aeainst any dismember
ment of the Fatherland.
The hopes of the German people are
whole-hearted, but if the present pro
posal is scorned, the rejection of the
plan for a discussion of terms would
ierve to cement the empire more fully
in its determination and to dispel
peare talk and speculation which has
been Vurr-vnt.
I lerlin new.-pa pers were not san
guine totliiv that the peace offer would
be accepted, aitho applauding the
hanrellor's steps. The comment of
Kditor Theodore Wolff of the Tage
bl.itt is typical:
Warning to Kntente.
"If the opposing governments should
decline the peace overtures or d'sdain
them as a sign of weakness and suf
fering. The people will once more ask
themselves whether they are not being
driven senselessly and without urgent
need to new sacrifices and renewed
massjicres.
"The German people, if their op
ponents answer in the negative, will
fee cb-arly it is their duty to bear the
he.'ivy burden, or heavier burdens, so
I'.iiK as there is no possibility of agree- j
"ing upon the acceptable and sensible j
peaoe." I
Tie I'ost warns the entente "if Ger- j
nanys hand is refused, her fist will
snm be felt with increased force." j
The editorial a Iso suggests that i
Germany's own peace offers indicate j
t here is no necessity of neutral na
tions' offers for peace. j
Ready to Submit Demands.
Merlin. Dec. 1". via Londnn, Dec. 13. j
Alt ho Chancellor von Kethmann-
I Toll weg did not disclose the definite 1
proposals on which Germany and her!
allies are prepared to make peace in,
his speech before the reichstag such j
proposals are ready and will be com-:
municated to the entente powers if
the chancellor's offer should fall upon
responsive ears.
The chancellors speech in the
rei( hstag yesterday was not marked
by a single expression of dissent, while
the significant passages were greeted
with hearty bravos and cheers. It
was noticeable however, that Count
l'riderich yon Westarp. the conserva
tive leader, and others of his follow- i
ing. sat silent and unmoved, even
when the galleries and newspapermen
joined demonstratively in the ap
plause. Some of the opponents of the chan
cellor are opposed to any movement
1n the direction of peace except on
the basis of "Woe to the conquered."
Most members of the reichstag, how
ever, express the opinion that the em
peror's decision was wise and timely
and showed pleasure at the formal
Mep taken toward ending the war.
The indefinite adjournment of the
reichsta, by its ow n decisions leaves
the government a free band to con
duct 1 urther negot at ions and is re
garded -ts tantamount to a vote of
confidence
Put It I p to Allies.
llerlin. Dec. 13. Germany has not
asked neutral powers to start peace
negotiations. The American em
bnssv's understanding is that she has
ni'iely asked neutral powers to in

the central powers are willing to dis

England Awaits Lloyd-George's
Speech on Tuesday.
Believe He'll Stand by His
"To-a-Knockout" Policy.
London. Dec. 13. The British peo
ple have already answered Germany's
offer of peace "No, not on such a
basis as proposed."
That answer was perfectly apparent
today. It was so reflected not only
in the newspaper comment, but in ex
pressions from the people of the
streets.
The nation looks to Lloyd-George
next Tuesday to frame this -answer.
It cannot be a direct reply, since it is
hardly expected England's consulta
tion with her allies over what form
the diplomatic answer shall be can be
concluded that soon. But Tuesday
will be Lloyd-George's first appear
ance as premier before the house of
commons and before news of the Ger
man proposal came, he had been an
nounced as ready to outline on that
date the aims and purposes of the
new cabinet.
Look to Lloyd-George.
Press and public alike look to
Lloyd-George on this occasion to voice
the nation's rejection of any peace
which is based on Germany's idea of
her victory.
' Germany's peace terms, as given
out by a German embassy official in
Washington, were generally regarded
as preposterous and unworthy of seri
ous consideration here.
Won't Act Host'1'-
The indications are that the various
evwernments of the entente allies uo
not intend to act hastily in .making
joint response to the peace proposals
of the central powers. It was pointed
out in well informed quarters today
that while each one of the allied goy-
.nmtnt. minht indicate its general
attitude, consultation among the allies
under the treaty binding tnem to sucn
action probably would require". t-0 or
three weeks. :
Find One Pacifist.
Among numerous interviews with
public men gathered by the London
nrpRH there is onlv one advocating ac
ceptance of Germany's proposition and
immedate entrance into negotiations.
That is the opinion voiced by Philip
Snowden. the empire's leading pacifist.
who considers that the allies will incur
an awful responsibility if they decline.
It is at least their duty, he holds, to
see whether the German proposals
contain the possibility of ending the
war on conditions reasonable and, as
far as possible, satisfactory to every
body. Chorus of Derision in Paris.
Paris. Dec. 13. The offer of peace
of Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
is received with a shorus of derision in
the French press. The newspapers are
unanimous that it is an admission
that the situation is getting critical in
Germany and that the chancellor
j wants a way out before it is too late.
! His move is considered to have the ad
i ditional advantage that in the event of
its failing it will enable him to throw
the blame for the continuation of the
1 war on the allies, which he hopes will
! have a moral effect on Germany and
the neutral nations.
. "Time for Feints Is Past."
"A clumsy trap." is the caption un
der which the morning papers print
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg's
speech in the reichstag.
"The time for feints is over." says
the Petit Journal. "We" are no longer
in the presence of the trial efforts of
those persistent appeals to interview
ers and newspaper articles. Chancel
lor von Hollweg summoned the reich
stag. not to hear his speech, but to
be confronted with an act. We do
not know if at Berlin there are people
so naive as to imagine that the allies
are likely to swallow this clumsy bait,
even on the morrow of tho events in
Rumania. In any case Field Marshal
von Hindenhurg's statement shows
that the military cherish no such illu
sion. "What is still more certain is that
treacherous German move aims at
something else than genuine peace.
It seeks an internal and external ef
fect. In Germany it is intended to
convince the people that the govern
ment is not responsible for the con
tinuation of the struggle. Abroad it
desires to persuade neutrals that the
allien are pursuing a policy of am
bition. That is the explanation of
the pretended moderation in the tone
of the speech."
What Will I.loyd-fieorge Say?
London, Dec 1 3. England is look
ing forward to next Tuesday, when
Premier Lloyd-George will address ths
house of commons for Britain's answer
to German's peace proposal. Until
that time, British men and women are
considering but one thing to con
tinue the war until a decisive victory
is established.
Tne statement of Lloyd-George In
his recer.t interview with the United
Press is cited as the only answer Eng
land should consider until the littlM
Welshman, in whose hands England's
fortunes have now been placed, ha:,
spoken again.
Jn this statement Lloyd-George said:
"The fight must be to a finish to
a knock out." -
If the comment of London newspa
pers is any criterion. England does
not propose to regard the German
peace proposals in any other light
than "another German trick."

WORLD GUARANTEE OF PEACE
That Xecessary, Considerlngr
Germany's Frame of Mind.
Frankly, Expect England to
Scorn Proposition.
Washington. Dec 13. What part
the United States will play in further
ing Germany's suggestion for peace is
undetermined today.
But these three big ideas toward It
are in official minds: '
-That England and her allies
should at least discuss the offers.
That any settlement, especially in
Germany's present frame of mind, -would
have to be backed by a world
guarantee of peace.
That the United States will not
be stampeded in the peace move
ment.
On the whole, the sentiment here
is that at present the United States
ought merely to act as messenger
for Germany and pass on her pro
posals. President Wilson is undecided; ha
has not even told his cabinet what h
thinks. But his closest followers be
lieve that this nation ought to know
what the allies think of the offer be
fore making any move. f .
Believe England Will Reject It.
Furthermore, they say frankly they
believe England will scorn the offer,
especially if based on the terms an
nounced by a German embassy offi
cial. . .
In these circumstances, America's
course must be cautious, officials
hold.
Information obtained today from
four of the best informed men in close
touch with the administration, includ
ing one of the foremost men- in the
councils and confidence of President
Wilson, is to the effect that anythiug
purporting to be President Wilson's
idea, now, is a fiction. -' - -,
. .The president, he said, has not evet)
confided- to his cabinet-what he -plans,
and indeed, has not yet decided. But
the official view, as reflected by Wil
son's closest advisers, can be stated
thus:
Deserves Allies Consideration.
On the first point, the administra
tion regards the question of peace so
enormous that it must be given seri
ous consideration.
On the other hand, it feels con
vinced already that the allies will
scorn the offers. But be Germany's
motive political, altruistic or greedy,
the idea of a step to end the war is too
momentous to be cast aside without
fullest official discussion.
In these circumstances, the govern
ment may lend its influence secret
ly perhaps to getting such discus
sion. But it will go cautiously before put
ting itself on publte record behind
Germany's proffer, until it knows ac
curately whether there can be tha
slightest chance of success.
On the question of a world guar
antee of peace, officials think that
Germany's terms as revealed by a
German embassy official are such
that an internal agreement could
make them "stick." And, at this time,
they feel it is doubtful if such a guar
antee could be effected.
Why a World Guarantee.
The reasons for desiring a world
guarantee are these:
Germany would do well. to return to
the status she had territorially before
the war, but ln addition she wants a
way into Asia Minor. Her terms im
pose a hardship upon Russia because
she wants a buffer between that great
nation and her eastern boundary. But
such terms could not be attained,
probably.
Hence, right on that point, the need
of a world guaranty of peace would
arise.
Belgium would be restored, but at
a terrible sacrifice. There would be
no restitution for the ravages of war,
unless perhaps, Germany should buy,
at an enormous rate, the Belgian Con
go as a restitution measure.
Belgium's fate in the present war,
officials think, makes the idea of a
world guarantee of peace even more
essential than perhaps do the quea-
