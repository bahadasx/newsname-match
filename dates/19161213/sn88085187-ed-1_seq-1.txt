BY THE EDITOR
Filled with enthusiasm over the heaped
up prosperity that is coining to Tacoma,
The Times a'few days ago suggested an old
time ixwn celebration <« some sort.
Well, Taooma is going to have an old-time
celebration.
It is going to be a little different from
what I had in mind at the time. I had
thought of a torchlight parade —if there are
still any torches in the world —of a great
booster mass meeting such as Louis Pratt
used to organize here, or of some other more
or less noisy and vociferous form of jubila
tion.
It remained for Ralph Metealf, state sen
ator, yesterday to propose a more seasonable
kind of celebration. Perhaps we can have
the other one later.
Senator Mctcalf's idea is embodied in the
above letter and is there too well expressed
to need repeating or summarizing.
This form of celebration, he urged, is high
ly fitting and might well be made part of the
Community Christmas Tree observance.
Would t, he asked, present the letter to
ihe mayv.H Of course, I would.
Mayor Fawcett was pleased with the sug
gestion and agreed at once to proclaim the
Feast of Candles. This he probably will do
tomorrow.
So Tacoma, "better, bigger, braver, once
more united and confident, forward-looking
Tacoma," is going to celebrate this wonder
ful Christmas of the Year of Promise in a
beautiful old-world fashion.
THERE IS A VERY GOOD
REASON WHY WE CALL
THIS VALLEY BULL ROY
By Fred L. Boalt'
Perhaps you know the story of
the FlUroy family.
A king of England, long*go, !
had an affair with a lady who
wasn't any better than she ought
to be, and Bhe bore him a son out
of wedlock.
Because the child was the son
Of a king, albeit illegitimate, the
king named him "Fitzroy"— Bon
of the king—and made him "no
ble."
And the Fitzroys have been big
guns in England from that day
to this. They are a stupid, useless
lot.
• • •
Finderne Mutual Fayne Val
dessa is an awful name to hang
on to a bull.
I am going to call him Roy, be
cause it's short and means king.
For Roy is a king among bulls.
Roy sold, at auction, at the
■lxth Pacific International Live
stock show at Portland, for $21,
--500, the highest price ever paid
on the coast for beef.
He had belonged to Bernhard
Meyer of Finderne, N. J. Now he

berg, owner of a valley stock

In the Old World men are made
"noble" for a variety of reasons.
Sometimes, as in the case of
the son of the lady of question
able morals, a noble line springs
from the illegitimate offspring of
royalty.
More often men buy their titles
by contributing to campaign
funds. Sometimes they are en
nobled because they have been
useful courtiers snobs.
Sometime* a man is given a
title because he is a great gen
eral.
Sometimes —but rarely—he Is
given a handle to his name be
cause he has performed some
great and useful work.
The trouble is that, when you
meet Lord So-and-So, you don't
know whether he Is descended
from the son of a wanton, or from
a grafting politician, or from a
great general, or from a man of
science.
A king may be clever, or a
dunce. A lord may be a sinner or
a saint. There isn't any rule to
go by.

The thing that yon Herberg's
herd lucks la a king. It has nobles
aplenty, and fine ladles.
Now, why is Roy a king among
Mills"
1b it because a maternal ances
tor of his had an affair with a
king? Is it because a paternal
ancestor contributed to a cam
paign fund or grafted his way to
wealth and power?
It is because of none of these
things that Roy Is king.
Roy is king because his grand
sire, Spring Farm Pontias Cornu
copia, known as the "$15,000
bull," had daughters that gave
more and better milk than other
cows.
He is king because his royal
mother, Finderne Mutual Fayne.l
at the age of 2 years, produced
1250 pounds of butter in 12
months.
He is king because all of his
ancestors have been record-break
ing PRODUCERS!
That is why Roy is a king
among bulls.
I feel sure the yon Herberg
herd will be Inspired to greater
usefulness and productiveness by
his kingly presence.

"I AM BETTER OFF DEAD"
"John said to me, 'You're
raising chickens, but you're
raising me no children.' If
I can't raise any children for
John I am better off dead
than alive!"
Judge Clifford's courtroom,
crowded with spectators who had
expected to hear John Plerwsza
testify In his own defense In the
case In which he is charged with
having killed his wife, Stella
Plerwsza, at Wilkenon, Oct. 30,
was deathly silent as Joseph Mc-
Caskey, former mayor of Wilke
som, repeated this cry of Mrs.
Pierwsza Wednesday morning.
The woman, he said, had come
to him about two years and a
half ago, "thinking, as most of
these foreigners do, that the
mayor can do everything," and
had asked him to arrest her hus
band for striking her. She had
exhibited a red mark on her,
shoulder where she said he had
struck her.
Her story was that she had
allowed a hen and 16 chickens to
come into her kitchen because
there was no suitable henhouse
[for them, and John, coming
home and finding the kitchen
dirty, had struck her and re
proached her for her childless
ness.
Contradicts Doctors.
Aside from his family troubles,
however, McCaskey said, he had
never heard any harm of Pler
wsza.
McCaskey was the undertaker
who cared for the woman's body
after her death .and he testified
that powder marks were distinct
ly visible around the bullet-hole
in her head.
This Is contrary to the testi
mony of physicians earlier in the
case.
K. L. Sherlll, an attorney, told

of having taken a revolver from
Mrs. Pierwsza's hands in Sep
tember, 1913, as she stood with
it pressed against her breast.
Takes Gnn Away.
"John told me," he said, "that
he was going to leave his wife,
as he could not get along with
her, and get a divorce. He had
tried to take away his clothes
and she wouldn't let him. I went
there and found her crying. John
had a suitcase on a chair, but
when he tried to put his clothes
in It she would take them away.
He told me on the way to the
house that she was kind of
crazy and he didn't want to fight
with her. I told her she had bet
ter let htm have his clothes and
have no trouble. She seemed to
quiet down for a moment, and
then she went into another room
and came out with the revolver
pressed against her breast.
"John cried out, 'She's
going to shoot! She's going
to shoot!'
"She Mid, 'I can't stand
this; I'm going to kill my
self!' I took the revolver
and told her not to act that
way, and she grew quiet
again."
Pierwsza wiped his eyes quietly
several times during this and
other parts of the testimony. He
will take the stand Wednesday
afternoon, it is understood.
Many Exhibits.
Many of the surroundings of
the tragedy have been transferred
to the courtroom.
Besides the model of the kitch
en range and the corner of the
room, the range itself now
stands Inside the railing, and to
day a portion of the kitchen
wainscoting, which had been re
moved bodily, was brought in,
together with a strip of carpet
from the kitchen floor.
These unwieldy exhibits crowd
the attorneys aha witnesses, and
add a touch of grotesqueness to
the formality of the proceedings.
Several witnesses testified
Wednesday morning to Plerwsza's
good reputation In Wilkeson.
Peter Peet, a miner, who had
stayed In the Plerwsza house
the night after Mrs. Pierwsza's
death, at the request of the
sheriff, told of having heard the
alarm clock go off at five min
utes of four.

LONDON, Doc. 13.—Terms which arc believed to constitute the only b«asii
upon which the entente powers are willing to enter upon peace negotationoi
were ascertained this afternoon frooin various sources by the United Press.
One of the provisions would be for full indemnity by Germany for devasta
tion to the nations which she has invaded.
These terms, although unofficial, are believed to represent the eoncessioni
which Germany must make to obtain peace, They are as follows:
The evacuation and restoration of all occupied territory, including Belgium,
Northern France, Poland, Berbia and Rumania — with full indemnity for th«
devastation which German occupancy of those territories has entailed.
Restoration of Alsace-Lorraine to France.
Cession of the Constantinople Straits to Russia.
Indemnity ship for ship and ton for ton, for all destroyed snipping.
Adequate punishment for those responsible for atrocities committed by,
German forces.
It was emphasized in all quarters that the only questions of a possible, ne
gotiable character in the peace proceedings might be as to the disposition of
certain captured German colonies and the character and limitation of Ger
many's future armament.
