Washington D. C., Dec 10.?
Both branches of Congress moved
slowly during the opening
week of the short session while
legislation was being whipped
into shape, but they will get
down to actual work this week.
The program in tne Senate is
somewhat uncertain Hpripn^ont
upon a meeting: of the Demo
cratic steering committee tomor
row. While the Interstate Commerce
committee is deliberating
on plans for expediting the Pres
ident's railroad legislative program,
three measures are readv
for immediate consideration.
They are the District of Columbia
prohibition bill, immigration
bill and corrupt practices meas
ure.
Corrupt practice legislation
probably will be displaced temp- ,
bfarily by the immigration bill

with its literacy test probably
will pass the Senate without i
prolonged discussion, despite the .
. probability that it may meet an
other presidential veto. The
prohibition bill for the District
of Columbia is to be urged at |
every opportunity by Senator '
Sheppard, leading the fight for
the Democrats, and Senator j
Kenyon, for the Republicans.
Its passage by the Senate before
the March adjournment is re
garded as very probable.

Washington, Dec. 8.?In spite ]
of reiterated reports to the con- ]
Qffidals close to President i
ihfcr Secretary McAdoo nor Sec-1 <
fetafy Hotlston will retire from I
the cabinet at the close of the <
president's first term. Attorney <
General Gregory, who returned ]
toda3r from Texas, refused to j
say whether he was planinng to j
kesign. In his case, however, i
the reports are generally credit
ed among his friends.
One evening a stern father
came rather hurriedly Into the
parlor and was much shocked
to see his daughter dnd her
"young man" occupying the
same chair.
*'Sir," he said, shaking his
head solemnlv. "wh On I it;nc I

courting my wife she sat on one
side of the room and I sat on the
other."
"Well," replied the suitor, not
in the least abashed, "that's what
I should have done if I had been
courting your wife."

wr f* VU k/vTIUV
In those old distant vanished
days when we were young our
fathers raised the kind of hogs
called razorbacks, so thin that
they could slide through cracks.
Their spinal columns had an
edge far sharper than an iron
wedere, and you could take a
porker's spine and shave yourself
and do it tine.
They were ungainly, ugly
brutes; they ran to appetites and
snoots; and you could feed them
for a year on bran and shorts
and corn in ear, and when to
weigh them you went around,
you saw they'd gained but half
a pound.
Then someone with a bulging
brow, and brains as much as
laws allow, no doubt remarked,
"Doggone my dogs! We're fools
to raise this kind of hogs! We
feed them milk and grain and
meal and all we harvest is a
squeal."
But breeders now of pure bred
swine have done a work that's
great and fine; they've made ouragriculture
pay, and chased the
farmer's wolf away. They've
preached, till all men understood
their creed, "The best is none
too good," and now the scrubs
are rarely found where once
they rooted up the ground.
And farmers having pure bred;
sows, begin to yearn for purebred
cows; and then they fill the
air with howls because they
haven't better fowls, and so at
last tliey cannot rest till all their
out in every other line.
The modern pure-bred, up-todate,
so trim and handsome,
slick and straight, is no more
like the old-time hog than my
gray cat is like a dog. It is a
peach from tail to ears, and represents
long earnest years of
wise selection, care and thought,
and now it's to perfection
brought. The smoothest critter
on the pike, it stands for progress
and the like.
And if the farmer has the
change, there are good breeds
through which to range. The
Duroc with its ruddy hue is
charming in the critic's view;
the Poland-China brings delight,
as does the stately Chester White,
the Berkshire, Yorkshire, Tamworth
brands are popular in
many lands. Just see that pedi
gree is strong and then you'll
know you can't go wrong.?
