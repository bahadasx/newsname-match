Ashland's Parks ;
j Well Described
Following are extracts from a let
ter published In the Dally Gazette
Times of CorvalliB. The letter was
written to the paper by Mr. N. R.
Moore, who spent several days here
gathering data. The letter is long,
bo is not published in full. Follow
ing this letter was another in the
next issue of the Corvallis paper
drawing lessons from Ashland's
achievement and suggesting ways in
which Corvallis might benefit from
them:
"Gazette-Times: In recent editor
ial comment about what Corvallis
might do to make this city of special
interest to touring autoists, reference
was made to the preparedness of
Ashland In this respect. I wonder
how many, other than the very few
Corvallis autoists who have partaken
of the Ashland hospitality, know just
what the altogether charming and
progressive city at the base of the
Slskiyous has done to Induce auto
parties to tarry a while, spend a few
dollars perhaps, and take away with
1 them a splendid Impression of the
opportunities and attractions that
city has to offer.
"For those who do not know, let
me cite the fact that less than two
' years ago Ashland bonded for $175.
000 for the development of lithla
springs there. Elsewhere over the
United States and in foreign coun
tries medicinal springs have attract
ed not only the dyspeptics and gam
blers, but capitalists as well, with
the result that great hotels have ris
en and small towns have grown Into
large communities and waxed fat on
the coin of those who will travel far
and spend generously in their effort
j to patch up worn-out tummies, dried
up livers, gangrened kidneys and
paralyzed gizzards. Hot Springs,
Arkansas, French Lick, Indiana,
.Carlsbad and Wiesbaden, etc, are
instances.
"I wish I might give the details of
the wonderful park that has been
developed about these two lithla
springs, but suffice It to say that one
. block from the heart of the business
section, along dashing, bounding, bil
lowy Ashland creek, Nature provided
a parkslte that Chicago or New York
or Philadelphia would give a million
dollars to possess. Ashland took
eighty acres of this that lies adjoin
ing the national reserve leading up
to snow-crowned Ashland peak, and
is spending most of that $175,000
thereon. Given such a site, a hun
dred thousand dollars will do much,
and working under plans provided
by MacLaren, landBcapist for Golden
Gate park and the Panama-Pacific
exposition, one of that famous art
ist's best men seems to be giving
the Ashlanders full value for their
money.
"The point I want to get to is that
jart of the wonderful park devoted
to autoists. In getting to Lithla
park the stroller passes from the

Third Oregon To Be
Mustered Out Soon
Late advices from Washington
state that the third Oregon regiment
will be mustered out as soon as prac
ticable and returned to the status of
national guard troops. The troops
are now nt the mobilization camp at
Clackamas, having recently returned
from near the Mexican border. The
officers in command at the camp
have set October 1 as the tentative
date on which to muster out the first
company under the orders of Septem
ber 7 from the war department.
Mustering out will be about as
much of a task as mustering in.
Each member must sign the roll and
pass a physical inspection. The indi
vidual records of each man will "he
made out in duplicate and the copies
that go to the federal mustering of
ficer have to be signed twice by
him really signed, not rubber
stamped, according to report.
Under the new orders the follow
ing regiments are designated for
mustering out: Second and seventy
first New York, first and fourth New
Jersey, fourth Maryland, first and
second Illinois, first and third Mis
souri, fifth California, third Oregon,
second Washington and first Louisi
ana. All are infantry regiments.
The order involves about 15,000
troops. WJien mustered out they
will go to their homes unless re
quired by the governors of the states,
under whose commands they will
then be, to stay mobilized for any
Billings' Statement
On Road Matter
In an Interview with Mr. G. F. Bil
lings this forenoon he made the fol
lowing statements to a Tidings re
porter relative to the situation on
the proposed change in the Pacific
Highway near his place, where it is
desired to eliminate the grade cross
ing over the railroad:
"The situation is simply this. That
Billings and Billings made a proposi
tion to the county commissioners and
the city of Ashland about July 15,
1915, agreeing to let them have a
right-of-way for the Wright's creek
route on very liberal terms. One
condition was that the farm crossing
known as the Myer crossing should
be vacated and a similar crossing
granted at the place where the pres
ent highway passes over the railroad
track (the old road was to be va-;
cated.
"It seems that in taking up the
matter oi an underground crossing
with the railroad company the county
officials neglected to include the mat
ter of the private crossing with the
other matters to be considered be
tween the county and the railroad
company. The railroad company
passed upon the matters which werej
brought to its attention, and when It .
was discovered that the private cross-1
ing matter had been overlooked It was '
taken up with the company, who sent
down a contract for a private farm
crossing which seems to have been
made wholly In the Interest of the
railroad company and ignoring the
rights of the party needing the cross
ing. Even the high officials of the
county are not at all surprised that
the company's crossing proposal was
not accepted.
"There seems to be no good reason
why it is not as well for the com
pany to grant as liberal a crossing as
the one which would be surren
dered." A County Fair
For Everybody
The Jackson County Fair at Med
ford this week is for everybody. It
begins on Wednesday, and anyone
who can not find a place for himself
or something to enjoy must be a lit
tle out of tune or hard to please. If
be ralse3 anything he can find a
place fo.' it at the fair, whether it
walks on two legs or four, or crawls
over the ground like a pumpkin vine
or on a trellis with the grapes and
berries. Or, if it doesn't navigate
at all except up through the moist
earth toward the blue sky to bear a
pod of beans, a juicy tomato, a sun
flower or a rose; of it it is plucked
from the bough of some beautiful
green tree, like a ruddy cheeked ap
ple or a golden pear, to sweeten the
tongue of the lover of good things to
eat; or If it dwells among the lowli
est with the cabbage heads and the
dead beets, still there is a place for
it at the fair, and if it has been
properly raised and cared for it may
draw a prize for the lucky owner.
If a person has nothing to take
but his own poor self it may pay him
to go. He might see or hear some
thing that would do him good." He
might learn something new. He
might find out a better way to plant
a row of peas, build a hen coop or
feed a cow. The possibilities are
great for the man who goes with a
purpose and it is doubtful if even
the aimless and purposeless could
find a better place in which to spend
their time.
The boys and girls will have a
high old time anyway, this Is sure.
They know a good thing when they
see it, they want to win out at every
thing they undertake, and they want
to undertake everything that holds
promise of enjoyment. They should
be encouraged to go and engage in
the activities planned for them. In
fact, take it all in all, everybody
should go, have a good and profita
ble time and return home better
equipped to buckle down for another
strenuous, happy and profitable year.
Watt Buys Out
Lowery Shares
Dave Watt of Butte, Mont., who
has been spending the summer in
Ashland, has bought out Mr. Low

claims owned by Messrs. Lowery,
Watt and Dave Good. Mr. Lowery
has returned to Butte, Mont. The
Montana men are both greatly
pleasd with Ashland.
Ashland Day at County Fair,
Medford, Friday, Sept. 15th
For the hearty co operation to pop
ularize Lithla park during this last
summer and for the magnificent at
tendance at the Springs Dedication
Celebration, Ashland is under obliga
tion to send a large delegation to the
County Fair at Medford on Ashland
day, Friday, September 15.
The Commercial Club has appoint
ed the following committee to make
all necessary arrangements: A; C.
Nininger, Frank Shinn, C. B. Lam
kin and H. O. Frohbach. The com
mittee met last Saturday and respect
fully ask each and every auto owner
in AshlaLd and vicinity to take hU
family to the fair on that day.
Should the capacity of your auto be
larger than necessary for your fam
ily, then see to it that you take your
neighbors, but be sure to take a full
load.
A special effort Is being made this
year to have an exceptionally good
fair and the arrangements there are
somewhat different than in former
years. The agricultural, horticultur
al and stcck displays are as usual at
the fair grounds, but the fancy work
and other displays of ladies are lo
cated In one of the empty store build
ings in the city proper. Entertain
ments and exhibit of gowns on live
models will take place there, and in
order that the citizens of Ashland
may have an opportunity to see these,
a special train has been arranged for
to leave Ashland from the old motor
depot at 1 p. m. and on return leave
REVXIOX.
Chautauqua park is full of
tents and over two hundred
veterans from all over southern
Oregon are gathered in Ashland
for the annual reunion of the
old soldiers and sailors of south
ern. Oregon. The convention
will be formally opened Bt the
armory tonight by the Ashland
band, who will play patriotic se
lections, following which the
Coast Artil'ery Company will
give an exhibition drill, an in-
' formal reception will be held
and other features.
Stores Will
Probably Close
The Commercial Club committee In
charge of arrangements for Ashland
land day at the County Fair (next
Friday) state that there is an immi
nent probability of the stores of the
city closing Friday afternoon for the
Ashland day part in the fair. Prac
tically all of the merchants who have
been Interviewed have expressed their
willingness to close, and indications
are for a record-breaking crowd from
Ashland to Medford Friday.
Harold Merrill
Makes Glee Club
Harold Merrill, son of Mr. and Mrs.
F. R. Merrill of this city, has won
signal honors at the University of
California, where he started this fall
as a freshman. Harold has been
chosen for the university glee club
and will take his place in the bass
section. For a freshman to win a
place on the glee club Is considered a
marked indication of more than usual
ability. Mr. Merrill graduated from
high school here in 1914 and sang
bass in the high school quartet. He
was also a prominent football man.
Revenue Stamps No
Longer Required
The recent law passed by congress
authorizing the discontinuance of the
use of revenue stamps Is now in ef
fect. The local offices of Wells,
Fargo & Co. and both the telegraph
companies received notice Friday
night that, beginning Saturday, the
use of revenue stamps would no long
er be required. The local banks re
ceived letters this morning to the
same effect, so that notes and legal
conveyances pass muster now without
stamps.
Phone news items to the Tidings.
Medford at 9:30 or 10 p. m. The
train from Ashland will go direct to
the fair grounds, thereby saving auto
hire from the city to the grounds.
The train at night will leave the de
pot at Medford. The Southern Pa
cific has made a rate of one and a
third fare (55 cents) for the round
trip for adults and half of that for
children under 12 years of age. The
school board have under advisement
the matter of allowing any of the
pupils to be excused where the par
ents desire them to attend the fair
on that day.
I The closing of the stores on Friday
fternoon will be considered by the
Business Men's Association at their
meeting tonight. The Ashland band
in full uniform may be there. This,
however, is dependent upon the ac
tion of the Business Men's Associa
tion tonight. Badges for all are be
ing provided and every auto should
display an Ashland pennant. Every
one should arrange their affairs so
that Ashland day at the fair will
have a big attendance and apprecia
tion be shown to Medford for what
she has done for Ashland in the past.

Water on Live Wire
Injures Woman
Several days ago an Ashland wom
an, whose name could not be ob
tained, discovered a live electric wire
down and burning a tree. In her
effort to extinguish the blaze she
thlr a bucket of water on the wire.
The electric current passed through
the water and entered the woman's
body. The results were not as seri
ous as they might have been, but
City Electrician Strickland states that
It Is a great wonder the woman was
not badly Injured. Mr. Strickland
wishes to improve this opportunity
to caution all people always to keep
away from electric wires," for contact
with them, directly or indirectly, may
mean death.
Prohibition Speaker

Congress Adjourned
Sept. 8th, 10 A. M.
Congress adjourned at 10 a. m.
September 8 after a session lasting
about nine months, , during which
time appropriations were made to the
extent of over one and one-half bil
lion dollars. In many respects this
has been a record-breaking session.
Over seventeen thousand bills were
introduced, of which 252 became
laws, and,, In additon, about thirty
public resolutions and 150 bills.
Rogue Fishermen
Have Good Year
Mall Tribune. "It has been a
prosperous year for the fishermen at
the mouth of Rogue river," states
George Putnam, who has returned
from a trip to Gold Beach and Wed
derburn. "The Macleary cannery
has packed 8,000 and the Seaborg
cannery 3,000 cases Jf salmon. The
pack is not yet complete and indica
tions promise the largest pack since
the days when Hume operated the
cannery, when the ' pack used to
reach 18,000 rases.

Council Seeking
New Dam Site
Last spring City Engineer Walker,
while in the canyon, noticed a good
site for building a dam and later
mentioned it to Mayor Johnson, who
has had in mind for some time the
matter of making some provision to
augment the city water supply by
building a storage reservoir to tide
over the dryest part of the season
when the water is at the lowest stage
along the latter part of August or
early In September before the rains
start.
Other business, celebrations and
such matters have kept the council
pretty busy all summer, so the en
gineer's report has never yet been
made. However, It will be ready and
will be submitted to the council at
their next regular meeting a week
from Tuesday.
This season there has been plenty
of water both for domestic use and
irrigation. In fact, there is every
season if people will not waste it,
though sometimes near the close of
summer it has been advisable to re
strict irrigation to certain hours of
the day. The matter of providing
storage facilities Is largely a measure
looking to future needs when the
city becomes much larger than it Is
now. At present the city supply
comes from the natural flow of the
creek only. There Is enough water
in the creek with the winter and
spring supply to furnish a city prob
ably ten times as large as Ashland is
at present. Consequently it seems
the part of wisdom to look ahead
and plan adequate storage reservoirs
to catch the flow of water during the
wet season so it can be available for
use when needed, both for the city
water system and the electric light
plant. To this end the city en
gineer's report Is desired.
Scandinavian Band
Concert Sunday
On next Sunday the Ashland band
will present a concert of Scandinav
ian music which will be something
quite unusual and well worth hear
ing. A large attendance Is anticipat
ed and the Scandinavian society of
the valley will probably attend en
masse. The band has been working
on the music for this concert at re
hearsals throughout the summer
season and has the several selections
well In hand. The music for the con
cert was secured direct from New
York and has probably never before
been heard in this valley.
The concert next Sunday Is the
final one of the summer series. With
the weather which Ashland Is hav
ing at present the park Is one of the
most popular places In the valley,
and If any possible way of continu
ing the concerts for at least two
weeks longer can be found, the con
cert season should be lengthened.
The Ashland band Is rounding Into
an organization which is easily on a
par with the ordinary professional
band and offers music which for
quality and execution Is seldom ex
celled. The concert last Sunday was
exceptionally well received by the
large crowd out. The old soldiers
who are here for the reunion were In
attendance in a body and especially
appreciated a patriotic selection,
"The Blue and Gray Patrol."
Drag in Deer
By the Horns
Leaving here fresh and ambitious,
Saturday noon. Cliff Jenkins and
Charley Hast dragged wearily back
Into town Sunday evening after trav
eling what Cliff alleges was a dis
tance of 475 miles. Weary as they
were, they returned triumphant, for
between them there swung a fine
buck. They secured the buck up
somewhere In the vicinity of Panther
butte along early Sunday morhlng.
The buck was a monster and the job
of dragging him over Into the Ash
land canyon and down to Long's
cabin took until 4 o'clock In the af
ternoon. Just how big the buck was
can be guBsed from the fact that af
ter dragging him for miles there still
remained three points on one side
and five on the other. Cliff says he
wouldn't do the same stunt again for
all the venison in the world.

The first ranch they saw in this val
ley was the Barron place In the head
of the valley above Ashland.
Mr. Herrin, upon arrival, took U!
a donation land claim near Med
ford's present location and farmed
there until along In the eighties,
when he moved to Ashland to schoof
his children. North of Ashland
across Brar creek he bought 1,500
acres of land and went Into the sheep
business, which he has followed ac
tively until very recent years, when
he arranged a partnership with his
youngest son, who is now conducting
the business.
Mr. Herrin was a man of large

Denver, having changed his route oa
account of his wife's sickness.
The three members spent a few
minutes at the Ashland station in
talking with citizens and giving out
Information about the plans of the

inspection to . determine the best
places In which to locate the Federal
Farm Loan Banks, of which there
will be twelve. These are entirely
Independent of the Federal Reserve
BankB and will be located irrespec
tive of commercial centers, the situa
tion of each bank to be selected al
together with reference to farm loan
needs. The transactions of these
banks will be largely in the nature
of a mall order business and matter
of location is not important. It (s
expected that the locations will be
decided upon sometime in December
