LONDON, September n, 4:45
p.m.?Attacks on Bulgaria from
both the north and the south are
apparently in preparation by the
entente armies in the Balkans.
A movement from the south de
veloped today in official news
from Paris that the British had,
taken the offensive on the north-'
eastern Macedonian front. They
have crossed the Struma about 40
miles northeast of Saloniki in an
advance toward the Bulgarian
border, after strong artillery prep
aration, and are attacking the vil
lages of Nevolyen and Karab
jades.
Serbians Also Advancing.
The conclusion is drawn from the
official French report In regard to
. operation? In Macedonia that an of
fensive campaign has been inaugurated.
In addition to the British attack along
the Struma, the Serbians already are
advancing against the Bulgarians, who
some time ago crossed the Greek fron
? tier near Lake Ostrovo and made a
quick advance southward. Since that
time the Bulgarians have retired con
siderably nnder pressure. The French
also are forcing the light, attacking
from the Vardar to Lake Dolran.
At the beginning of the Macedonlau
operations last month the Bulgarians
pushed down rapidly from the border

The present British thrust, which may
mean the beginning of an Important
offensive with the object of placing
Bulgaria between two flres, is directed

MAINE IN THROES
OFHOTELECTION
To Choose Governor, Two Sen
ators and Four Representa
tives in Congress.
PREVAILING FAIR WEATHER
PROMISES LARGE BALLOT
Results Expected to Be Known by
Midnight Despite Difficulties
of Communication.
PORTLAND, Me., September
ii.?Voters of Maine to the num
ber of 140,000 or more went to
the polls today to elect a gov
ernor, two United States senators,
four representatives in Congress,
a state legislature and a state
auditor.
Fair weather prevailed. This
was expected to cause a big vote,
equally desired by both sides.
Reports at noon from various
parts of the state indicated that
a heavy vote had been cast. Two
arrests for alleged attempts to
"repeat" were made in this city.
Result by Midnight.
! The polls opened at 6 o'clock, and
must close not later than 5 p.m.
Many returns will be slow. Some
twenty towns and plantations are with
out telegraph or telephonic communica
tion with the outside. However, the re
sult should be indicated before mid
night.
National issues have been pressed to
the fore. Party leaders brought hun
dreds of speakers into the state, includ
ing former Justice Hughes, former Vice
President Fairbanks and members of
President Wilson's cabinet, to persuade
i the voters to line up with or against
the national executive and the majority
in Congress.
Maine, however, is normally repub
lican. Democratic leaders insisted that
something more than a scant republican!
victory would be required to constitute
repudiation of the administration, while
ja. democratic plurality, however small,
would be accepted by them as an in
dorsement.
Problem of Progressive Vote.
The state officers are now democratic.
That party has one United States sen
ator and one of the four representatives
in Congress.
In 1914 the progressives cast 18,226
votes for governor. How their vote
would split today was a matter of dis
pute.
Both sides claim they will receive
sufficient progressive support to carry
the election.
The fight for United States senators
is fspecially important. Upon the out
come may depend the control of the
upper house, to obtain which the re
publicans must win nine seats now
held by democrats. For the first time
senators will be chosen by popular
vote.
The control of the state legislature
is important locally, as the two houses
on a joint ballot elect the state officers,
with the exception of governor and
state auditor.
Soldiers on Border Vote.
LAREDO, Tex., September 11.?The
2d Maine Regiment of National Guards
men, doing duty along the Mexican
border in this vicinity, today exercised
their rights of franchise in the Maine
elections being held today. The priv
ilege of franchise was accorded under
a law passed by the state of Maine
during the civil war, authorizing sol
diers in the field to vote. Upon com
pletion of the vote the ballots will be
sealed and forwarded to the secretary
of state of Maine.
THREE STATES WILL HOLD
PRIMARIES TOMORROW
Georgia, South Carolina and Louis

and Congressional Candidates.
ATLANTA, Oft., September 11.?Demo
crats of Georgia, Louisiana and South
Carolina will hold state primaries tomor
row to select nominees, whose later elec
tion is assured, with few exceptions, by
lack of second party opposition.
In Georgia a governor, twelve repre
sentatives and all state officials are to be
nominated. Gov. Nat E. Harris is opposed
j for renomination by Hugh M. Dorsey of
I Atlanta, Dr. L. G. Hardeman of Com
| merce and Joseph E. Pottle of Milledge
j ville. All twelve democratic representa
; tives, except C. G. Edwards of the first dls
j trict are seeking renomination, and seven
j have opposition. Peter W. Meld rim and
\ J. W. Overstreet are candidates in the
j first district.
| Congressional Race in Louisiana.
! In Louisiana congressional nominations
are to be made and contests have de
veloped only in the sixth district, where
former Gov. J. Y. Sanders and Amos L.
Ponder are rivals for the place now held
by Representative L. L. Morgan. Repre
sentative Ladislas Lazaro is opposed for
renomination by T. A. Edwards and A. M.
Barbe. In each of the six other districts
there 1$ but one candidate. In the final
election democrats will have opposition
in one district, the third, where Repre
sentative W. P. Martin, progressive, is a
candidate for re-election.
Secondary Primaries.
In South Carolina secondary primaries
are necessary because no candidate for
the gubernatorial nomination got a
majority of votes cast in the first primary
held two weeks ago. Gov. Richard J. Man
ning and former Gov. Cole L. Blease
will contest again. For the same reason
Representative Wyatt Aiken and F. H.
Dominick are opponents in the third con
gressional district and two candidates for
railroad commissioners are contesting.

SUSPENSION OF TRAFFIC
ON MANY SURFACE LINES
Impeded Travel on Subway and Ele
vated Roads in New York?Gom
pers Urges Labor Support.
NEW YORK, September n.?
With the leaders of 750,000 labor
men of Greater New York and
vicinity threatening a sympathetic
strike, traffic on the subway and
elevated lines in Manhattan and
the Bronx impeded, and the sur
face systems in those two bor
oughs and Westchester county
virtually tied up, the general
strike situation assumed a more
serious aspect.
Samuel Gompers, president of
the American Federation of
Labor, declined to discuss the
probability of a general strike, i
Union leaders asserted that, if
necessary, 50,000 union men
could be called out within six
hours.
Difference of Opinion.
Traction officials attribute the falling
off in service on the subways and ele- j
vated roads to the unprecedented in
crease in traffic caused by the stoppage
of all the surface lines. Union leaders
claimed, however, that the defection of
heretofore loyal employes of the roads
was responsible.
All members of trade unions in New
York, Yonkers, Mount Vernon and New
Rochelle found themselves today active
factors in the dispute between the In
terborough Rapid Transit Company
and its employes. The various individ
ual labor organizations in these cities,
served by the Interborough and its sub
sidiary companies, received the appeal
drafted by the Central Labor Union last
night, requesting a sympathetic strike
of all organized wage earners in their
Jurisdiction "in support of the conten
tion of the setreet railway men for the
right to organize."
Sympathetic Strike Delay.
Since the response to this appeal must
be decided by vote of members, several
days must elapse before its effect will
be known. A Central Labor Union com
mittee has been organized, however.
Daily meetings will be held *o direct a
sympathetic general strike, in case it
is called.
Opinions were expressed today that
most of the unions appealed to would
defer definite action in the hope that
such a radical step might be avoided.
Labor leaders declared, however, that
strikes might be called without delay
in trades directly affecting the opera
tion of street cars, such as longshore
men, who handle coal barges, and en
gineers who work in power houses.
Strike Spreads on Surface Lines.
While elevated and subway lines con
tinued running today, without apparent
interruption, the strike on the surface
lines has spread rapidly. Union offi
cials assert that 11,600 men are on
strike.
Not a car wheel turned all dg.y Sun
day in Yonkers, Mount Vernon and New
Rochelle. Every surface car also stop
ped running, last night, in Manhattan
and the Bronx, after these two bor
oughs had received an extremely lim
ited service during the day.
Jitneys were in demand yesterday,
particularly in the cross-town thor
oughfares of the city. In some in
stances adults were observed on roller
skates.
The seriousness of the situation has
caused citizens to turn for relief to
the municipal government. It is ex
pected that the public service commis
sion, which has been investigating the
strike. wiH make a report, some time
today, placing responsibility for the
situation and throwing its official in
fluence into the balance' to aid the side
whose contention is upheld.
Sympathetic Strike Urged.
The resolution passed by the Central
Labor Union last night calls on all
unionized wage earners in Greater New
York, Yonkers, Mount Vernon, White
Plains and New Rochells to sanction a
strike "in support of the contention of
the street railway men of their right to
organize." The resolution recommend
ed that the workers in the various
trades "lay down their tools until the
companies are forced to recognize the
carmen's union."
According to State Organizer Frayne |
approximately 750,000 men and women
are enrolled in the unions that were
represented at the meeting.
The delegates, it was said, discussed
the possibility of collateral street rail
roads assuming the attitude of officials
of the Interborough Rapid Transit
Company and the other lines involved
in the strike here, who, at the present
time, "recognize the union, but insist
upon intimidating their men to ignore
it." The delegates were unanimously
of the opinion, it was asserted, that the
action of the transit managers "was
something that affected trade unionism
as a whole."
Assurances Are Given.
Delegates at the meeting, it was said,
assured William B. Fitzgerald, organ
izer of the carmen's union, that their
members were "willing to fight to a
finish, morally, physically and finan
cially, in the interest of trade union
ism."
Officials of the railway companies,
when informed of the action of <he
union leaders, asked whether the build
ing trades were to be included in the
recommendation for a sympathetic
strike. They were told that no action
with respect to these trades had been
taken.

PREPAREDNESS FIRES NAVY.
Sea Battle Practice Expected to
Show Important Result*.
NORFOLK, Va., September 11.?In ;
the opinion of naval officers with the
Atlantic lieet, the coming battle maneu
vers and target practice, which will
be resumed on the southern drill
grounds, off the Virginia capes, will
be the most important in the history
of the United States Navy. With the
fleet at this practice will be more big
ships than ever before assembled under
the United States colors. Naval of
ficers declare that the preparedness
spirit that has swept the country dur
ing the past year, and which resulted
in greater things being done for army
and navy, has enthused both the
officers and men of the entire fleet, and
that the slogan on every ship of the
Atlantic fleet is efficiency and pre
paredness. They look for remarkable
records in the gunnery tests. The ships
will be stripped down to battle con
ditions.
This week will be spent in indi
vidual target work and maneuvering
for positions by each ship; next week,
squadron firing at short and long
range, the most interesting part of
target practice.

GERMANS ASSAULT
ALLIES IN FRANCE
:
Make Desperate Efforts on the
Somme to Regain Lost
Positions.
LONDON AND PARIS CLAIM
ALL ATTACKS WERE VAIN
Correspondent With British Army
Tells How Irish Troops Cap
tured Ginchy.
LONDON, September n.?In
northern France the Germans are
responding to the heavy blows
which drove back their lines along
several miles of the Somme front
last week.
Yesterday and last night they
struck hard at both the French
and the British, but, according to
the entente reports, were unable
to regain any of the lost ground.
Bepeated Assaults Made.
In their attacks on the French south
of the Somme, from Berney to below
Chaulnes, the Germans used flaming
liquid, assault following assault until
five had been delivered. They suffered
heavily in these fruitless attempts,
Paris declares.
The British were attacked at Ginchy,
the village captured by them last Sat
urday, but beat off the two advances
made by the Germans, as they did also
attempts against British positions near
Mouquet farm and Pozieres.
Five Attacks Against French.
PARIS. September 11, noon.?Five
times last night the Germans attacked
positions newly won by the French on
the Somme front. The war office an
nounces they were repulsed each time,
with heavy loss.
The official report says the Germans
employed burning liquid in making
their attacks. The fighting occurred
south of the Somme, from Berney to
the region south of Chaulnes.
"Last night ten of our aeroplanes drop
ped sixty bombs of heavy caliber on im
portant military factories south of
Bruges." says the official statement. "The
bombardment was carried out from a
height between 400 and 800 meters and
was very effective. On the same night
104 bombs were dropped on ammunition
depots and other military establishments
north of Somme-Py. Violent explosions
were heard. Finally, one of our air
squadrons attacked the barracks and
aerodrome at Saarburg (in Lorraine.)
Twenty well-aimed bombs of heavy
caliber inflicted serious damage."
Battle's Fury Redoubled.
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE. September 10, via London, Sep
tember 11.?The battle for the ridge be
tween Thiepval and Ginchy redoubled in
fury yesterday afternoon, when the Brit
ish successfully stormed the right bastion.
The artillery fire for the two preceding
days was continuous and of terrific in
tensity. In reply, the Germans hurled
thousands of gas and tear-producing
shells as well as high explosives on the
British line.
The result of the tremendous bom
bardment was that German trenches
were destroyed over a four-mile stretch
j and their garrisons took refuge in shell
holes and fortified cellars ol the village
of Ginchy. The British troops left their
trenches about 4:30 p.m. The main at
tack against the village of Ginchy was
intrusted chiefly to the Irish. The Ger
man fortifications consisted of cellars
fitted with ingenious loopholes for
rifles and machine guns, and a mud fort
in the center of a farm which bristled
with machine guns.
Ginchy Taken by Irish.
The fighting was desperate, but the
Irish carried through their first attack
in eight minutes. After half an hour's
pause they again dashed to the assault,
and in ten minutes had established
thertiselves in positions north of the vil
lage.
The right wing advanced more slowly j
east of Ginchy, and the fighting con
tinued all night. The German machine
gun defenses were finally smashed by j
Britisn shells.
On the rest of the battle front the I
Germans - made ,good their defense in I
High "Wood, but lost ground and prison- !
ers both east and west of it. The total
number of German prisoners taken so
far in this fighting is about 400, most
of whom are Bavarians. The Germans
fought very hard to hold their last posi
tion on the ridge, but the weight of the
British howitzer fire and the impetus of
the attack were irresistible.
Berlin Reports German Attacks.
BERLIN, September 11, via London.
4:50 p.m.?The British followed their
great attack of Saturday on the Somme
front by vigorous assaults over small
er portions of the line yesterday. The
official report of today says these as
saults were repulsed. The announce
ment follows:
"Front of Gen. Field Marshal Duke
Albrecht of Wurttemberg?There is
nothing to report.
"Front of Gen. Field Marshal Crown
Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria?The
great British attack of September 9
was followed yesterday by limited but
vigorously conducted attacks on the
i'ozieres-Sars high road and against
the Ginchy-Combles sector. They were
repulsed. Fresh fighting has been in
progress since early this morning for
possession of Ginchy."

Quebec bridge, the largest canti
lever suspension \bridge in the
world, collapsed and fell into the
St. Lawrence river today while it
was being hoisted into place. The
bridge company places the num
ber of dead at twenty-five and is
unable yet to estimate the num
ber of the injured.
Hundreds of people who had
lined the shores to see the 5,000
ton mass of steel raised by enor
mous derricks, members of the
Canadian and Australian parlia
ments, noted engineers and many
newspaper men who were on a
Canadian government steamer
observing the operation, wit
nessed the accident.
Boats Pick Up the Survivors.
The collapse occurred when the span
was about fifteen feet in the air. It
was thought at first that all working
on the span had lost their lives, but
many were able to get out of the way
and struggled in the water until picked
up by boats.
Observers said that the span broke
in two places. First, one of the cor
ners appeared to give way, and a break
in the center follow a second later.
There were hundreds of craft in the
river nearby, and hundreds of boats
rushed to where the span dropped and
aided in picking up the survivors. The
fallen structure is 200 feet under water,
and engineers who witnessed the col
lapse express doubt whether it will
ever be brought up again.
Span Raised Very Slowly.
The bridge was being constructed, at
a cost of $17,000,000 in order to shorten
the railway journey from Halifax to the
Canadian northwest by 200 miles.
The bridge stands on the site of the
structure which collapsed on August
29, 1907, with a loss of seventy lives.
The central span which fell today
weigns more than 5,000 tons and is 640
feet long.
The span had been constructed on
pontoons a few miles east of the bridge
site and was rowed into position im
mediately under the gap left in the an
chor arms of the structure. Chains with
links thirty inches in diameter together
with girders were then attached to
the span and 8,000-ton hydraulic jacks
commenced the stupendous task of lift
ing the span into place. This work
could be accomplished only a few feet
an hour, and as the distance from the
river level to the floor of the bridge is
150 feet the engineers had not counted
on completing the operation until the
end of this week or later. The bridge
i was to have been ready for train serv
ice next spring, marking an important
milestone in Canada's engineering rail
! way history.
Many Saw Span Fall.
The juggling of 5.000 tons of steel un
der unprecedented circumstances in the
Dominion attracted to the scene today
several thousand spectators, including
members of parliament and newspaper
men gathered on vessels furnished by the
Canadian government. t .\
Members or the Dominion cabinet wit
nessed the collapse from the deck of a
government vessel, while American tour
ists crowded hundred of other boats of
all classes. Eminent American authori
ties on bridge building and members of
the Australian parliament, returning home
after visiting in Europe, also were at the
scene. Traffic for ocean steamers had
been temporarily suspended.
The project interrupted today originated
in 1853. when, at the request of the Que
bec city council, a New York engineer
submitted plans and estimates. Courage
and capital were lacking and it was not
until 1882 that the scheme again was giv
en serious consideration.
Began Construction in 1907.
Later Canadian engineers obtained a
charter, and after many years of delay
the building was begun, only to ter
minate in the collapse of the unfin
ished structure in 1907.
Canada's federal railway department
then decided to reconstruct it, and
placed the undertaking in the hands of
a commission, which included several
noted American bridge builders, among
them Ralph Modjeski of Chicago and
C. C. Schneider of New York.
The plans for the bridge provided for
a channel span longer than that of any
existing today anywhere. Its contem
plated length from shore to shore was ,
3,239 feet, with a distance of 1,900 feet
between anchor buttresses. Provision
was made for two railroad tracks, two
street car tracks and two roads. It W
to be used by the following railroads:
Canadian Pacific. Grand Trunk, Quebec
Central, Intercolonial, Quebec and Laka
St. John. Quebec and Saguenay, Cana
dian Northern and Delaware and Hut*
son.
