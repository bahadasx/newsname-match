^ The falling off In the Sabbath school
ft attendance at the various Sabbath
[' - schools yesterday caused by the ban
ftV put upon children under sixteen years
\ f of age attending any public gathering
'/: on account of the Infantile paralysis
epidemic, clearly demonstrated the
ft* adage In the minds of the older people
p present that "This world would be a
Wi- dreary place were there no little chlldren
In It."
Charles W. Evans, superintendent of
W: the largest Sabbath school in the city,
:y -: the First M. E., In speaking of the lack
of children present voiced the sentl.
&? ments of practically all the church goV
ing people In the city when he said,
."It was Just like a funeral." Two other
prominent church people expressed
.. their feelings In the same words exE',
actly and this was the feeling that
generally prevailed throughout the
k city,
"No Sabbath school at all." "Almost
b' worse than none at all." "Missed
them?" I guess we did" and a lot of
similar ATnrPRRinna worn crlpnneH in
H'. talks with pastors. Sunday school suit
- perlntendents and prominent teachers
t of the schools.
. Not <?nly did the "grown ups' suff.'Cer
from this edict but the children genBw/ti'allr
all -over tho city were dlsconsongrjate
over the fact that they were
Er.'barred from going to Sunday school
gV-.. and hundreds of children put In rathK.j
er a lonely and miserable day on this
jtja.: account. One bright little tot of seven
1^1 years and the daughter or a promtSc,.'
nent Sunday school superintendent,
j&:>--on being told on Saturday that she
could not attend Sunday school made
fij/ the remark. "I Just hate tomorrow."
pr: In some of the schools the attend'
2 ance was cut down fifty per cent.
v while In many others the attendance
> fell much lower. The Ministerial asso&.
elation decided that owing to this fact
they wouldcoun t the year as having
- 60 Sundays InBtead of 62 and would
base the per centage of attendance on
y 50 Instead of 62 and for this reason no
Sunday school report was issued for
5 today.
The "grown up" attendance was
< - considerably lessened owing to the
_ fact that the parents had to stay at
P . home in many Instances to tako care
I of the children.
;V . . A brief summary follows of the manyf.
. ner In which the attendance was cut
down at the various Sunday schools.
. This summary shows in round Hums'

school pupils present yesterday
and the general average of the various

fact that the Sabbath school is largely.'
ly made up of children under 16 years
of age entirely dispensed with the
p.\ abbath school exercises yesterday.
While the churches and the older
R ~ people generally regretted the edict
which forbade the little children from
a, coming to school, yet the general senM
tlment seemed to be that the local auI
thorlties had taken the proper measurea
to prevent a spread of the" dread
fe,-: disease and commended the officials
Sfr. for their foresight tn the matter.
|S.,. Many of the older pupils of the
Rfschools who have at times been greatly
ly annoyed by the chatter and clatter
made by the children and the confu- j
K lion which generally goes with a gathK
erlng of little ones, made remarks yesIgg^'terday
to the effect that the silence
BeV waa oppressive and they would give
St," worlds to hear a little of the noise and
fflk :; to see the merry smiling faces of the
If1.'' ~ children as they file to and from their
W. various Sunday school gatherings.
feT The general sentiment voiced by
b> . ine cnurch going people was to the etp..,
feet that If It were not for the children
the various church services would lack
vJm and interest and would not be the
JET interesting stimulating places they are
Est, under normal conditions.

PORTLAND, Maine, Sept 11.?Voters
of Maine to the number of 140,000
or more went to the polls today to?
elect a governor, two U. S. Senators,
four representatives In Congress, a
state attorney general and a state
auditor.
National issues have been brought
to the fore and party leaders brought
hundreds of speakers Into the state
Including former Justice Hughes, former
Vice-President Fairbanks and
members of President Wilson's cabinet
to persuade the voters to line up
with or against the national executive
and the majority in Congress.
Maine, however, Is normally Republican
and the Democratic leaders Insisted
that something more than a
scant victory for the Republicans
would be required to constitute a repudiation
of the administration while
a Democratic plurality, however small,
would be accepted by tlfm as an endorsement.
Fair weather prevails and this was
expected to cause a big vote equally
desired by boui sides.
Tne state officers are now Democratic
and the party has now one U.
S. Senator and one of the four Congressmen.
In 191'' "he Progressives had 18.226
votes for governor. How their
vote will split today Is a matter of
dispute.
Both sides claim they will receive
sufficient Progressive support to carry
the election.
The polls opened at 6 o'clock and
will close not later than 6 p. m.
Many returns will be slow as some
2p towns and plantations are without
telegraphic or telephone communication
with the outside. However the
result should be indicated before midnight.

Extra Precautions Taken 3y
Health Officials Against
Infantile Paralysis
All grocery stores, fruit stores, meat
shoos, etc.. have orders from Cltv Phv
siclan C. M. Ramage, stating tbat nothing
which Is intended tor sale to the
public and which is for internal consumption,
can be permitted on display
unless screened from dust and flies.
The order went out last night signed
| by Dr. C. M. Ramage and C. R. WeirI
Ich, M. D? director of Division of Preventable
Diseases of W. Va., and Is
I Intended as an extra precaution In prei
venting the spread of Infantile paraly|
sis which secured a foot hold In the
city a few days ago on the East Side.
This case, however, that of the little
three year old daughter of Mrs. John
Holt, Is practically under control and
may be declared cured shortly. The
city physician, who has the case In
hand, feels that there Is little cause for
excitement Inasmuch as the case was
discovered before It had gained any
headway.
Several cases were rumored over the
city this morning. This caused extra
and unnecessary work on the part of
the health departments. The disease
is not by any means prevalent In West
Virginia. It has been reported as extraordinarily
scarce and Indications
are that the epidemic which has struck
the eastern states will not reach this
section.

and Assistant Horan j
Now At Work !
Staate Fire Marshal Mose Kindle- '
berger and assistant, John S. Horan. ]
arrived in Fairmont this afternoon and t
picking up Fire Chief Okey Watklns
at the fire department went to Locust i
avenue to investigate the Ridgely fire !
and to Edgemont to investigate the 1
fire which partially destroyed the W. !
S. HuBsey store.
The fire officials who came here 1
from Wheeling, intended to make this <
week an inspection week in the city
and appointed September 11 as the '
first day of Inspection. Their work, ]
however, will have to be on a different 1
basis as last night fire fiends got busy '
in the southern section of the city and '
started fires in two stores. '
The first fire was the Hussey store '
at Edgemont where the fire depart. 1
ment went with all haste and managed
atfer a difficult tight to get the 1
flames under control. Among the
usual crowd which followed the direction
taken by the truck were Cal Conaway,
sheriff, and Tom Buckley, Jailer,
also the regular number of night
policemen.
Upon their arrival at the scene of
the blaze they were told that two men,
one wearing a mask, was seen to leave
the home of S. R.Nestor when the
crowd began to grow and the noise to
awake residents in the section. It was
later found that the house had been ]
entered. Bloodhonnds were brought
and the scent followed but nothing
had been run down at a late hour this
afternoon. The store of W. S. Husey
had also been entered, the back door
being Jimmied, the store probably
robbed of some small articles and set
afire. The damages will run to $2,000. j
The firemen managed to get the ,
spread of flames stopped and after
carefully going over the premises to '
aea that no . further danger .lurked in 1
corners went back to their headquar- c
ters. (
At five o'clock they were again ,
called, this time to -the Ridgely store .
on Locust avenue where a fire had 1
been discovered by Miss Nancy Arnett ?
who ived in the rooms over the store.
Miss Arnett was awakened by tbe heat
and smoke and immediately tried to
leave the building; but the flames bad
gained such headway that escape by
this route was impossible. She than
found her way back to thefront of the
building and began calling for help.
In the meantime the Rldgely family
ha dbeen awakened by the heat and
light from the flames and William
Rldgely, Jr., who lives at Bell Run,
but was at his father's home for the
night, rushed into the street and saw
Miss Arnett's plight. He procured a
ladder and placed it at the front window
and brought Miss Arnett from the
building into his father's house. It was
just at thlB time that the firemen from
the central etatlon arrived on the
scene and in a very few minutes they
had the fire extinguished. The building
was owned by the Rldgely brothers
adn was very badly damaged. John
Oldroyd was the proprietor of the store
and carried sufficient insurance to cover
his loss. There was no insurance
carried on the building. Another house
owned by the Rldgely brothers was
slightly damaged by the fire. The origin
of the fire is unknown but seems
to have started on the back porch of
tbe building where a large oil can is
kept.
