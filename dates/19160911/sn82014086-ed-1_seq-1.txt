REV. G. WHITE PROHIBITION
NOMINEE FOR GOVERNOR
Sends Letter of Acceptance-to Chair
man Hohenthal.
South Manchester, Conn., Sept. 10.
E. L, C. Hohenthal, chairman of the
prohibition party' in Connecticut, to
night announced that Rev. G. White
Field Slmonson of Seymour had re
considered his Intention of not ac
cepting the prohibition nomination
for governor. In his letter of accept
ance to Mr. Hohenthal, Rev. Mr. Si
mon son says:
"There is but one way to win this
fight for the freedom of the people,
and that is by political, administrative
authority, followed by a .faithful writ
ing of prohibition into the constitu
tion." Referring to the platform, Mr. Sl
monson says that the measures
thought of today as "progressive" were
first advocated by the prohibition
party and then kept before the people
by agitation until they won out. Equal
suffrage, civil service reform and di
rect elections illustrate some of the
reforms, he said.
Under the caption "Preparations
for Victory," the candidate says: "The
conflict has been long and discourag
ing, but the lisrht of the day of vic
tory dawns. The age-long traffic that
hes bestrode the earth like a Colos
sus is now crumbling to its
overthrow, by the battle of-'the bal
lots. The bugle has sounded the last
great charge! The scattering forces
are coming In! Now comes the time
for the rank and file of the citizenry
to close in at the voting booth and
consummate the fifty years of faith
ful fighting by a glorious victory."

SHARP NOTES EXCHANGED BY
GREAT BRITAIN AND SWEDEN.
Brought About by Allied Blockade and
Sweden's 'Seizure of Mails.
London, Sept. 10, 11.40 p. m. There
has been a f-.irther and rather sharp
exchange of notes between Great Brit
ain and Sweden in regard to the dif
ferences brought about by the allied
blockade and Sweden's retaliatory
seizure of mails in transit between
England and Russia. No solution 'of
the problem is in sight. The British
foreign secretary, Viscount Grey, In
sists that as a condition to stibmitting
the matter to arbitration Sweden must
promise not to interfere again with
English parcel post matter in transit
across Sweden. The Swedish govern
ment apparently is determined not to
make such an engagement.
It is noticeable that until now the
correspondence has been conducted al
most wholly between "Viscount Grey
and th Swedish minister in London,
Count Wrangel, but Viscount Grey's
latest note to Count Wrangel says the
count's communication is not under
stood and that the British minister at
Stockholm is being directed to present
the matter to the Swedish government.
Count Wrangel has now gone to the
continent and it is announced he will
stay for several weeks.
Count Wrangel's letter, given out to
day, says Sweden shares the hopes
expressed by Viscount Grey that the
correspondence may bring definite so
lution of the questions at issue and
that Sweden "would warmly congratu
late itself on the application of the
fertile principle of international arbi
tration." MEXICAN COMMISSION TO
RESUME SESSIONS TODAY.
Will Go Over Numerous Suggestions
Which Have Been Made.
New London, Conn., Sept. 10. With
the return here tonight of Luis Ca
brera and Alberto Pani from week end
trips to Boston and New York, mem
bers of the American -'Mexican joint
commission were ready to resume to
morrow their deliberations as to the
situation along the Mexican border.
General Tasker H. Bliss, assistant
chief of staff of t'he United States
army, is expected here soon, his pres
ence having been requested by the
American commissioners, who desire
the benefit of his personal information
as to border conditions.
Tomorrow's meeting will be devoted
to further discussions of ways and
means to end the disturbed border sit
uation. So far the commissioners have
been unable to formulate even a tenta
tive plan of action, and they will con
tinue to go over the numerous sug
gestions that have been put forward
at one time or another as to the po
licing system to be adopted.
Present indications are that the Joint
commission will meet only three or
four days during the week. Several of
the Mexican commissioners have press
ing business elsewhere which will re
quire their attention for a short time.
So far as the American commission is
concerned, however, the intervals will
be fully occupied by the commission
ers remaining here in the careful study
they are making of all available in
formal ion relating to the Mexican
problems.

LIFE ON ELEPHANT
ISLAND IN THE ANTARCTIC
Privations Experienced by Marooned
Men of Shackleton's Party.
London, Sept. 11. Life on Elephant
Island in the Antarctic as it was ex
perienced by the marooned men of
Lieutenant Sir Ernest Shackleton's
South Polar expedition, who were re
centlyrescued and taken to Chile, it
described in a message received from
Punta Arenas and published in the
Daily Chronicle today.
The day began," says the description,
"with breakfast which consisted mere
ly of penguin, fried in blubber, with a
drink of water. The morning's duties
consisted in clearing away snow drifts
and catching penguin. Lunch was
served at one o'clock, consisting of
biscuit with raw blubber. The after
noon was occupied with regular exer
cise over a track 100 yards in length.
"At 5 o'clock, when darkness fell,
came dinner, consisting of penguin
breast and beef tea. Lacking tobacco,
the men smoked grass from the pad
ding in their boots, while the pipes
were carved from birds' bones and
woort. The members of the party took
turns in reading aloud from the only
available books, merely, the Bible, on
encyclopedia, Browning's essays and
Carlyle's French Revolution. Saturday
evening was always marked by a
concert, the feature of which was ban
jo playing. A banjo was the only mus
ical instrument in camp..
"On one occasion there was a wel
come addition to the diet when several
undigested fish were found in the
stomach of a seal and greatly enjoyed.
These were the only fish caught dur
ing our stay. In August there was a
change in the diet when limpet were
gathered and seaweed was available
as a vegetable.

THE DUAL MONARCHY
NOT READY TO QUIT.
Statement Issued by Minister of For
eign Affairs.
Vienna, Sept. 7, via London, Sept." 10,
4. p. m. In a thoroughly frank manner
the Austro-Hungarian minister of for
eign affairs, Baron Stephen Burian von
Rajecz, discussed today in an interview
with the correspondent of The Asso
ciated Press the position of the dual
monarchy in the world war, which he
said had been erroneously character
ized by enemies and certain neutrals
as unsatisfactory.
"Austro-Hungary is -far from lying
down, as hoped by some," said the
minister In a tone carrying conviction.
"It is true we would hall peace with
Joy. but not the sort of peace our ene
mies would impose. So long as we
have to defend ourselves against those
who want to take part of our terri
tory, we naturally are unwilling to
discuss peace: so long we are also de
termined to hold out and win. The
thought that we are eager for peace on
any terms originates probably in minds
hoping that such will ' become the
case."
The minister then reviewed the sit
uation prior to Rumania's declaration
of war.

STATE ELECTION
-
Both Parties Are Confident That the Result Will es .
Victory for Their Candidates
A ROUSING VOTE IS PREDICTED BY THE LEADERS
Republicans Claim Everything, With Pluralities Approximat
ing 15,000 Democrats Estimate Their Plurality Will be
About 3,000 Vote on Congressional Nominees Will
Show Whether President Wilson's Administration is Ap
proved by Voters The Polls Will Close at 5 O'Clockv
This Afternoon.
Portland, Me., Sept. 10. A rousing
vote at the state election is predicted,
The day promises to be fair.
The weather is the one factor that
the politicians have not attempted to
influence by argument or fireworks
and the forecast was anxiously await
ed. Tonight there was rejoicing in
both the republican and democratic
camps for it was expected that the
expression of Maine's opinion on state
and national policies would be a de
cisive one and both sides faced the
issue with confidence.
Both Parties Confident.
After a Sunday of comparative rest
and review and during which the heat
of battle cooled somewhat, the party
managers declared that they stood by
the figures proclaimed at the close
of the campaign last night. The re
publicans claim everything with plu
ralities approximating 15,000. The
democrats make a similar claim, ex
cept that they set the (pluralities at
3,000 and admit that the outcome in
the Third and Fourth congressional
districts is in doubt.
If an average is struck between the
rival claims Maine, politically speak
ing, may be said to be either party's
state tonight. Three conclusions,
however, are not disputed. If Gov
ernor Oakley C. Curtis is re-elected
by the democrats, the result will be
accepted generally as an endorsement
of the administration.
Interest in Congressional Election
If the democrats who now hold one
of the four seats seats in congress, re
turn Congressman Daniel J. McGilli
cuddy and capture the second seat,
which they expect, it will be con
strued as showing that the first and
second districts stand strongly behind
the national executive.
If the democrats by popular vote
re-elect United States Senator Charles
F. Johnson and win another seat in
the senate through the defeat of For
mer Governor Bert M. Fernald by
Kenneth C. M. Sills, dean of Bowdoin
college, it will be taken as evidence
that the voters of the state generally
Wish to hold up the hands of Presi
dent Wilson.
Fight for United States Senators.
The fight for United States sena
tors is especially important as upon
the outcome may depend the control
of the upper house, to obtain which
the republicans must win nine seats
now held by democrats. For the first
time senators will be chosen by pop
ular vote.

ENGLISH RAILWAY WORKERS
DEMAND RAISE IN WAGES
Situation is Said to be Becoming In
creasingly Serious.
London, Sept. 10, 8:42 p. m. The
situation in the rialway world arising
out of the deamnds of the men for an
increase in wages of ten shilling a
week has become increasingly serious.
At a meeting of 3,000 railwaiy work
ers at Cardiff today a resolution was
adopted providing that unless the de
mnads for the increase are conceded
by September 16 all railway work will
be stopped in South Wales at mid
night the seventeenth. The resolu
tion also stated that the advance in
wages should date from July 1 and
that the government should give a
definite guarantee that in the future
it will control the supply of food and
regulate prices. The resolution was
carried without a dissenting voice.
Judging from the government's atti
tude hitherto regarding the question
of the cor.tro' f n(. rliribution
and prices, there Is little likelihoor
that it will yiu.a to su.-n :. demand
and should the railway workers in the
other parts of the country endorse the
action of the South Wales men there
is danger .of a general railway strike.
The leaders of the men are working
hard to secure an agreement without
calling a strike, which would be re
garded as taking an unfair advantage
of the nation in a time of adversity.
