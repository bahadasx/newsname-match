distance of about 13 feot 'into the
river. Many of the workmen were

engineering feats of the word.
This is Uie second great catastrophe
at the bridge, lln 1907 seventy lives

come to witness the spectacle of the
completion of the bridge, including
cabinet and Parliament members and
engineers, saw the accident. Only
five or six of those who were plunged
Into the river were picked up.
The big span which buckled and

Guy S. Lowman, a former M. U.
coach, has been obtained by the Uni
versity of Indiana to coach the fresh

MI V0TEfl RECORD
147,000 Ballots of 1880 Will
Be Excelled Today,
Is Report.
By PERRY ARNOLD
(United Tress Staff Correspondent)
BOSTON, Sept. 11. Judging from
New England's Hub here this after
noon, in the light of fragmentary
word from all sections of Maine, the
pine tree state today will break all
records in the number of votes cast
at the election, which may point the
way to the national vote in Novem
ber. Both Democratic and Republican
leaders in Augusta declared their be
lief that the total vote Maine cast in
1880, a record, 147,000, would be ex
ceeded today. With splendid weather
prevailing the voters were out in full
force.
The fact that a record is expected
is also likely to delay securing com
plete figures. The fact was empha
sized today that the preliminary re
turns might be deceptive and should
not be used as indicative of the final
results.
