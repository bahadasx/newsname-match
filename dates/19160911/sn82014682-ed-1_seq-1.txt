Leaders of 750,000 Men Now
Threaten Sympathetic Move
With Street-Railway Men
(Auori(4 Ptm by fUnl WItvUm)
NEW YORK, N. Y, Sept. 11- With
the iaaders of 750,000 men of various
trades union threatening a sympa
thetic striks, New York Is faced with
the worst labor walkout in its. history.
Traffic Is virtually tied up now and
the sspect is serious.
President Gompers of the American
Federation of tabor, who arrived to
day, declined to talk for publication.
NEW YORK, N. Y., Sept 11.
At a meeting of union delegates yes
terday a sympathetic strike was order
ed which will call 750,000 men from
their posts. These workmen represent
stagehands, theatrical employes, long
shoremen, brewers, machinists, bar
tenders, molders and printers.
Throngs Cheer Vote
Amidst the wildest excitement a
vote was taken to decide whether or
not the affiliated unions would partici
pate in the prejent strike of the
street carmen and : when the result
showed that a general walkout would
be ordered the crowd ; broke out .In
cheers. -v .
Hundreds of strike-breakers have
been hired to take the places of the
carmen and the feeling between the
two factions threatens to develop into
violence. ,
The police department has appoint
ed a number of deputy patrolmen and
Is taking every preparation to prevent
any further outbreaks between the
strikers and the men who have taken
their places on the cars.

One Japanese who la an authority

The bridge piers stand on the '
site where a similar stnctnro col
lapsed in August, 1D07, witi a loss
of 70 lives. Undaunted by this,
a still heavier and stronger bridge
was' designed and work on it start
ed not loDg after, i ,
The history of the Quebec bridge Is
long and Interesting. As early as
1852 the project had been considered;
In 1884 it was up again for, considera
tion; but nothing was done till 1900
when the Quebec Bridge & Hallway
Co. began actual construction. ..? . Jn .
1907 the sections that had ben erected .
collapsed, with serious ; loss fit .life..
After the disaster the government de- ;
cided to have the bridge reconstructed
and appointed a board of three engi-.
neers to study various designs and .to
report a choice. They, chose a canti
lever design; contracts for. construc
tion were let in 1910 and 1911; and
since the latter date the board of en
gineers has comprised Ralph Modjes
kl. C.E., Chicago. Mr. CL C. Schneli.tr, 1
C.E., Philadelphia, and Mr. C..N..MDn
sarrat, C.E of Quebec; chairman and '
chief engineer. ' .
The main span Is the longest In the '
great bridges of the world, being.. arc
cording to the plans, - 1500 f eetj la -length.
From the floor of the bridge f
to the top of the main post Is a height ;
of 185 feet and the width is S3 feet
Other interesting features - of " the 1
new bridge are the weight of the stsel
structure, which is 65,000 tohsr the
main posts were 310 feet above, the -main
piers; each post weighs 12,000
000 pounds and rests on "shoes'
weighing 400 tons; one of the "cais
