Maine was exercisAig her proud
privilege of exhibiting a line on how
the nation feels as to democracy and
republicanism. The rocik-ribbed com
monwealth's voters were casting bal
lots for a complete state ticket and
national primary ticket.
Early word from practically all sec
tions of the state indicated fair
weather and local leaders predicted
a record vote.
"I am entirely satisfied with the
situation," remarked Wm. R. Pattan
gal, campaign chairman for the demo
crats. "I hold to the prediction I
made yesterday for a democratic vic
tory."
"An unusually big vote may he iex

republicans have centered their at
tack. Johnson is opposed by Fred
Hale, former progressive leader and
a son of Maine's grand old man of
the senate, Eugene Hale.
A blrdseye view of the Maine situa
tion today made it apparent that
each side will be satisfied with a par
tial victory.
Both sides tacitly agreed that at
least one Maine district will be demo

gross by Daniel J. McGillicuddy. He
is extremely popular throughout the
state.
For the first time In a good many
years, local Maine Issues have played
very little part in the campaign. For
the most part the orators have argued
on national questions. Uvea Maine's
perenial rum issue has been thrust in
to the background.
