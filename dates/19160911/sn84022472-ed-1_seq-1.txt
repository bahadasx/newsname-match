Gen. Bliss Aids Conferes
With Information on
Mexico Situation.
New London, Conn.'. Sept. 11 The
American-Mexican joint commission
resumed today, its efforts to find a
solution for the nroblem affectinfir the
Lihternational boundary. This was the
third Joint discussion by the six com
missioners. Luis Cabrera, chairman
of the Mexican representatives, pre
sided. Since their meeting, three days ago.
ythe-American members of the com-
mlsion have devoted much time to a
stAidy of the government reports on
the various ptiases of the border prob
lem. They entered the meeting today
prepared to go into a detailed exam
ination of the various plans for bor
der patrol that have been- suggested.
They are counting also on the per
sonal knowledge of the information
which MaJ. General Tasker H. Bliss
will be able to supply on his arrival
from Washington.
Before the meeting began' Secretary
Lane expressed confidence that a con
structive plan of action would soon
take definite shape. So far there has
been nothing done except to form a
general Idea or the Mexican reouest
that General Pershing's forces be with
drawn from Mexico. The basis of the
plans for policing the line that has
been talked over, however is the re
turn of the American troops to their
own territory. Insuring that movement
as the first step toward establishing a
permanent system of protection
against border bandits.
VILLA NOT YET DT SIGHT.
Washington, Sept. 11 All efforts of
General Pershing to confirm persist
ent rumors that Villa is moving
toward the border In northern Mex
ico so far have been fruitless. The
general,made this report today to the
war department:
"Reports regarding Villa's move
ments north have been continuously
received through El Paso authori
ties. So far these reports cannot be
confirmed here, although every possi
ble source of information is being
used. Patrols at San Lorenzo from
El Valle reached Santa Clara canyon
and about 30 miles on Chihuahua
road, but could hear nothing of Villa
or any movement of Villistas. People
had heard rumors of Villistas at 8a

of there." ' n.

MILLION STOCK
FOR HOUSING IS
GOING RAPIDLY
One Manufacturer Pledges
' Himself to Invest $100,
000 In Project. x
SEVERAL MILLIONS
IN WORK PLANNED
Charles G. Sanford Outlines
For The Fanner Scope
of the Enterprise.
The Bridgeport Housing Company, a
one million dollar corporation recent
ly formed to provide homes for thou
sands in Bridgeport will extend its
financial status far above the mark
set. will open its stock subscriptio,
to the public at an early date," and will
accomplish several million dollars
worth of building if the present plans,
as outlined by Charles G. Sanford,
president of the First-Bridgeport Na
tional bank and one of the executive
officials of the Housing company are
carried out.
Mr. Sanford declared this morning
that great financial Impetus had been
given the concern by local manufac
turers who were interested in finding
suitable living -accommodations for
their employes. To such an extent
have pledges for stock been made by
manufacturers in Bridgeport that a
large part of the million dollar sub
scription has been taken. One manu
facturer in Bridgeport, whose name
was not divulged, today guaranteed to
subscribe $100,000 in his own name,
according to Mr. Sanford.
Though plans have not been defi
nitely outlined for the financial
launching of the corporation, tenta
tive ideas are to issue common stock
at par. With $1,000,000 in the treas
ury, the. projects of the company can
be begun at once with largely ex
tended credit.
... "Several million dollars worth of
building is needed in' this city," said
Mr. Sanford. "It is by no means
planned to stop at the million dollar
mark. Two or three millions of dol
lars will be needed to compete the
plans as at present laid down, and
there is no question in our minds that
we will be able to get all the money
we need. '
"While Bridgeport factory owners
are really those most actively interest
ed in furthering the scheme, for it is
to their direct benefit th,at labor be
housed, the public is to be declared in.
Anybody wishing to subscribe for
stock will be accommodated and the
arrangements that will be consum
mated by the directors will aim to pre
vent any control of the ,stock by in
dividuals or group of individuals."
Mr. Sanford and Frank C. Blanch-
ard, new general manager of the
Housing Company,"who assumed his
office duties this morning refused . to
make public any selection of proper
ties in Bridgeport though it was as
serted that interesting announcements
of plans would be made next week.
A meeting of the executive commit
tee was held in Jhe Chamber of Com
merce offices today.
FIRE PERILS IN
CHEAP LODGINGS
REVEALED TODAY
Firemen See Potential Holo
caust in Water St. Blaze
Order Improvement.
Fire perils in the cheap lodging
houses of the city were brought to the
attention of fire and police officials
this morning when several fire com
panies were called out by a slight
blaze in a lodging house, located at
Bank and Water streets. The fire did
not amount to much, but Assistant
Fire Chief Beardslee and other de
partment officials got an eyeful of
menacing conditions.
The house is conducted by Seop
Papazian. It is three stories in height.
and on each of the upper two floors
there are half a dozen rooma. In each
room are from eight to twelve cots.
In a couple of the rooms, wooden
slabs in even great numbers form the
"flops."
x Narrow, rickety staircases commun
icate betweei. the. upper floors, while
the corridors are scarcely' wide enough
to allow two persons to pass.
Assistant Chief Beardslee sent out
several guests on a hunt for the pro
prietor. The chief wanted to tell him
about the propriety of allowing guests
to start fires in decrepit stoves the
cause of this morning's "excitement." A
defective flue sent smoke pouring Out
the windows as a backdraft fired soot
In the stove pipe, and a passerby pull
ed Box 16.
Four engine companies, one chem
ical company and two truck compan
ies responded to the alarm. Lieut.
Wheeler of the police department
traffic squad took chart"! of the tang
led up traffic conditions that followed
the arrival of the flock of apparatus.

UNIONS' THREATS
OF GREAT STRIKE
IN N. YJERIOUS
Leaders Assert That Situa
tion Has Now Reached
Stage That is Acute.
750,000 WORKERS
MAY GIVE SUPPORT
Subway and Elevated Lines
Suffer Further Falling Off
In Business.
i
NewYork, Sept, 11. With the lead
ers of 750,000 labor men of Greater
New York and vicinity threatening a
sympathetic strike, traffic on the sub
wav nnd elevated t( lines in Manhattan
and the Bronx impeded and the sur
face systems in those two boroughs
and Westchester county virtually tied
up, the general strike situation assum
ed a more serious aspect today.
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, declin
ed to discuss the probability of a gen
era,! strike, but other union leaders
,asserted that if necessary 50.000 union
men could be called out within six
hours.
Traction officials attribute the fall
ing off in service on the subway and
elevated rods to the. unprecedented.
inureaew ill liaii-iu utiuaru uy mo bluji-
page of all the surface lines. Union
leaders claimed, however, that the de
fection of employes of the roads was
responsible.
The various Individual labor organir
zations in New York, Yonkers, Mount
Vernon 'ndJew Roehelle received the
appeal drafted by the central labor
bodies last night, requesting a sym
pathetic strike of all organized wages
in their various districts, "in support!
of theVcontentlon that the street rail
wayman for the right to organize."
"Sine the response to this appeal
must be decided by vote of members
several days must elapse before its ef
fect will be known. " A 'central labor
committee has been organized, how
ever, and dally meetings will be held
to direct a sympathetic general strike
in case it was called.. Opinions were
expressed today that most of the un
ions appealed, would defer definite
action in the hope that such a radical
step, might be avoided. Labor lead
ers declare, however, that strikes
might be called without delay in trades
directly affecting the operation of
street rn.r. Riich nfl the loneahoremen
who handle coal barges and the en
gineers who work in the powerhouses.
While the elevated and subway lines
continued running today without ap
parent interruption, the strike on the
surface lines had spread rapidly. Un
ion officials assert that 11,600 men are
on strike. Not a car wheel turned all
day Sunday in Yonkers, Mount Vernon
and New Rochelle, and every surface
car stopped running last night in Man
hattan and the Bronx also, after these
two boroughs had received an ex
tremely limited service during the day.'
The seriousness of the situation has
caused citizens to turn for relief to the
municipal government. It is expected
that the publio service commission,
which has been investigating the
strike, will make a repot some time
today, placing responsibility for the
situation and throwing its official in
fluence into the balance to aid the side .
whose contention is upheld.

To See President at Rail

Exceeding care in guarding Presi

service men when the train bearing
the President and Mrs. Wilson stopped
in Bridgeport for a minute and a half
this afternoon. The President's pri

When the train came into the sta

Immediately secret service men
alighted and shooed the crowd back.
They said that the platform was too
narrow at that point to permit taking

The project interrupted! tsday or

of the Quebec city council, a New
York engineer submitted plans and es-(
timates. Courage and capital were,
lacking, however, and it was not until
1882 that the scheme again was given,
serious consideration. The cantilever
plan of bridge building was at that

many years of delay the building was .
begun, only to have it terminate dls-

The plans for the bridge provided for
a channel span longer tnnn mat or .
any existing today anywhere. Its
length from shore to shore when com
pleteii would be 3,289 feet, and the
space between the anchor butresses
was 800 feet. There would be two
railroad tracks, two street car tracks,
and two roads, and while the bridge
