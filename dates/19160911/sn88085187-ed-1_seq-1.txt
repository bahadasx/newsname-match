MO.Vrni.Al., Sept. It, —
The ccnliiil span of llie i.inr
l.i*. bridge, which liiik been
under construction for many
years mid which was to link
up tin 1 i ..in..1i..11 Iriinsi iinli
neiital railways system from
Halifax lo Vancouver, till to
day as it HM being placed In
paattltm, killing hi li-aM _;r.
workmen.
The Kpan, which weighs .1,000
tons, was towed to the Brltit.li
side early this morning and was
being hoisted 150 feet by special
ly constructed .tacks and chains
when it fell from a distance of
about 1 ."i feet Into the river.
An estimate at noon by offi
cials of the St. Lawrence Bridge
Co, the contractors, placed the
death list at 25.
The placing of the central span
has been heralded as one of the
greatest engineering feats of the
world and a commission of ex
perts from Oreat Britain, Ger
many and the United States work
ed out the plans.
Second <«re*at Disaster.
This is the second catastrophe
at the bridge. In 11107 seventy
liven were lost by the collapse -jfj
a portion of the structure thenl
under construction. i
The bridge is a $17,000,000
cantilever structure over the St.
Lawrence river and the span
would have been the final work
on one of the greatest engineer
ing feats in the world.
Thousands of persons who had
come to witness the spectacle of
the completion rf. the bridge, In
cluding cabinet and parliament
members and engineers, saw the
accident.
In 200 Feet of Water.
Only five or six survivors of
those who were plunged into the
river were picked up.
One of the girders holding the
span at the northern corner first
gave way as the huge mass of
steel was being lifted Into posi
tion.
The remaining jacks held for
a few seconds and then gave way,
and the span with a mighty splash
plunged Into the channel.
As the St. Lawrence river at
this point is about 200 feet in
depth, It is not believed traffic
will be impeded.
Arrangements have been made
to send divers down to ascertain
If .t will be possible to raise the
span.
Predicted by Worker.
A special train with 20 in
jured men from the bridge ar
rived here shortly after noon.
They were taken to the Jefree-
Hale hospital.
Chief Engineer McMillan was
on the central span when it fell
and was badly Injured. He was
rescued by a tug and was
brought here for treatment.
Among the known dead is Ed
ward Jordanais, aged 22. of
Providence, R. I. Before leaving
his boarding house last night to
go to the bridge he said with a
smile:
"Say, boys, let's all join In a
song. It may be the last one we
will sing together in this berg."
