Had Gathered to See the Wonderful Engineering
Feat; Corner Gives Way First, Then Structure ;
Crumples in Center; Falls From Height of 15 Feet;
Loss Estimated at $17,000,000
Quebec, Sept. 11. The span of the world's greatest
bridge collapsed and fell into the St. Lawrence river to
day with a loss of life variously estimated. The company
erecting the structure placed the number of deaths at up
wards of 25, but H. P. Borden, a member of the Quebec
Bridge Commission, expressed the opinion that only three
persons were lost. Several hours after the accident hap
pened, at 10.30 o'clock, a special train into Quebec brought
twenty men who had been injured.
Similar Accident 9 Years Ago
Nine years ago a similar accident at the same spot took a toll'
of 70 lives. To-day ninety men were carried into the river when the j
5.000 ton span, being raised from pontoons in an engineering feat 1
designed to complete the $17,000,000 cantilever suspension for trans-'
continental railway traffic, plunged a distance of fifteen feet into j
the water and sank 200 feet, perhaps never to be recovered.
Supports Snap Like Shells
Contradictory stories were told regarding the collapse. The
pontoons had been removed and the span was being lifted by mas
sive hydraulic jacks when, according to some of the spectators the
northern end of the span fell with the breaking of girders. Frantic j
efforts were made to place a chain rope around the tottering struc- I
ture but with reports like shells exploding the remaining supports
snapped and the span disappeared with a tremendous splash. Some t
of the observers said that the structure also buckeled at the center |
as it fell.
Groups Knocked Into Space
Groups of men at work slipped off into the water and others
were knocked into space by flying debris. Scores of craft containing
spectators went to the rescue and their endeavors prevented a larger
loss of life.
Sinks in 200 Feet of Water
Boats from among the hundreds of craft on which spectators had
gathered were rushed to the spot where the span disappeared. The
fallen structure sank 200 feet to the bottom of the river and engi
neers who witnessed the collapse expressed doubts as to whether
it could be brought up again.
Cost 817,000,000
The bridge was being constructed at
a cost of $17,000,000 in order to
shorten the railway Journey from
Halifax to the Canadian Northwest by
200 miles.
The bridge stands on the site of the
structure which collapsed on August
29, ISO 7, with a loss of seventy lives.
The central span which fell to-day
weighs more than 5,000 tons and is
640 feet long.
The span had been constructed on
pontoons a few miles east of the
bridge site and was towed into posi
tion immediately under the gap left
In the anchor arms of the structure.
Chains with links thirty inches in
diameter together with girders were
then attached to the span and 8,000-
ton hydraulic Jacks commenced the
stupendous task of lifting the span
into place.
This work could be accomplished
only a few feet an hour and as the
distance from the river leve' to the
floor of the bridge is 150 feet, the en
gineers had not counted on completing
the operation until the end of this
week or later. The bridge was to have

Lebanon Jeweler Catches
Thief Who Stole Watch
From Keller Home
When an Italian called at a Leb
i anon jewelry store and asked to have
the monogram "H. L. K." removed
! from a lady's gold watch, it led to the
discovery that the watch was the prop
erty of Miss Helen L. Keller and had
been stolen July 9, from the Keller
I summer home at Penbrook.

foreigner, examined the watch and

at once with Mr. Hoas and Harrisburg

he went hunting yesterday. When
caught by Game Wardens Baum,

serted that if necessary 50,000 union

Traction officials attributed the fall

elevated roads to the unprecedented
increase in traffic caused by the stop

leaders claimed, however, that the de
fection of heretofore loyal employes
of the roads was responsible.

Pershing Unable to Confirm
Rumors That Villa Is on
Raid Toward Border
By Associated Press
Washington. D. Câ Sept. 11.âAll
efforts of General Pershing to confirm
persistent rumors that Villa is moving
toward the border in Northern Mexico
so far have been fruitless. The general
made this report to-day to the War
Department:
"Reports regarding Villa's move
ment north have been continually re
ceived through El Paso authorities. So
far these reports cannot be confirmed
here, although every possible source of
information is being used. Patrols at
San Lorenzo from El Valle reached
Santa Clara canyon and about thirty
miles on Chihuahua road, but could
hear nothing of Villa or any move
ment of Villistas. People had heard
rumors of Villistas at Satevo, but
nothing of any action north of there."
