PORTLAND, Me., Sept. 11. Reporte

(r Aasoelated Press.)
PORTLAND, Me., Sept. 11. After
a Sunday of comparative rest and
review, during which the beat of
battle .cooled somewhat, the party
manager declared they atood . by
figures proclaimed at the close of the
campaign last night. The Repubji
cans claim everything with pluralities
approximately 15,000. The Democrats
claim pluralities of 3000. They ad
mit the outcome in the third and
fourth congressional districts Is In
doubt.
If an average is struck between the
rivals' claims, Maine, speaking politi
cally, may be said to be either party's
state last night. Three conclusions,
however, are not disputed.
If Gov. Oakley C. Curtis la re
elected by the Democrats, the result
will be accepted generally as endorse
ment of the administration.
If the Democrats, who now hold
one ot the four seats iu Congress, re
turn Congressman Daniel J. McQilli
cuddy and capture the second seat. It
will be construed as showing that the
first and second districts stand
strongly behind the national executive.
If the Democrats by a popular vote
re-elect United States Senator Chas.
P. Johnson and win another seat in
the Senate through the defeat of
former Gov. B. M. Fernald by Ken
neth'C. M. Sills, dean of Bowdoln
college, It will be taken as evidence
that the voters of the state generally
wish to hold up the hands of Presi
dent Wilson.
The fight for United States senators
Is especially Important, as upon the
outcome may depend the control of
the upper house.
The control of the state legislature
Is important locally, aa the two

BIG QUEBEC BRIDGE
DROPS INTO RIVER
Longest Cantilever Span in the
World Breaks in Two With
Heavy Loss of Life
(By Associated Trees.)
QUEBEC, Sept. 11. The new cen
tral span ot the Quebec cantilever
auspenslon bridge, the longest in- the
world, collapsed and fell Into the St.
' Lawrence river today while being
hoisted Into place, with a probable
heavy loss of life. Ninety men were
working on the atructure when It fell.
The bridge collapsed when the span
waa about 15 feet in the air. Ob
servers on the shore saw numbers of
workmen struggling In the water.
The structure sank 200 feet to the
bottom ot the river. Engineers wit
nessing the collapse expressed doubt
whether it would ever be brought to
the aurface again. It is declared the
span broke in two places, first one
corner appearing to give way which
was followed by a break in the
center.
The bridge was being constructed
at a coBt of $17,000,000 to shorten the
railway Journey from Halifax to the
Canadian northwest 200 miles and
stands on the site of the structure
which collapsed in AugUBt, 1907, with
a loss of 70 lives.
The loss of life is variously esti
mated, the company erecting the
bridge placing the dead at upwards
of 25. Twenty men are known to
have been lnlured and five bodies
have been recovered.
The property loss by the Quebec
bridge disaster Is approximately $600,-
000, stated Geo. L. Evans, of the
Dominion Bridge company. The sect
dent will delay completion of the
structure ten months. It is believed
the span can be raised.

Boston and Butte Capital
Invest Heavily in Tonopah
Boston and Butte capital has taken
hold of an area embracing 700 acres
on the western end of the Tonopah
district situated between the Great
Western and Bonanza holdings. ThlB
deal Is specially -significant in view
of the fact that neither Butte nor
Boston has even manifested the
slightest interest in Tonopah, and the
entry of millionaire copper interests
means that a new era is about to
dawn on the camp. The men repre
sented by this Investment Include a
coterie of capitalists who hitherto
have confined their operations to the
copper mines in which they established
themselves as leaders both from the
speculative and operating end.
The new company will be known as
the Tonopah Western Consolidated
and will be officered hy F. Ward
Paine, of Paine & Webber, New York,
as president; Oscar Roll a, ot the East
Butte Copper Mining company, vice
president; Frank Price,- secretary;
directors, Oscar Daube, Bryce Turner,
H. B. Gross, F. Ward Paine and
Oscar Rohn. The head offices of the
company will be maintained in Bos
ton. The standing ot the company
HOME FROM
may be understood from the fact that
H. B. Gross Is president of the East
Butte company and one of the best
kno'wn mining Investors In the United
States. The Tonopah Western Con.
Is ably financed to develop Its exten
sive holdings, which consist of the
Silver Queen group of five claims,
Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, three fractions
known as the Emma, Phillip and
Belle, better known as, the old Mar
jorle, the Desert King, Comstock,
Golden Gate and Table Mountain
groups, which unite the Bonanza,
Ruby and Great Western groups
owned by the Greenwater Copper
Mines and Smelter company and con
solidate in harmonious workings
something close to 1200 acres.
On the first of September the com
pany began operations by providing
for sinking the shaft of the Great
Western a further depth of 300 feet,
making It approximately 1600 feet,
or to the same level as the Bonanza
shaft, which will be connected by a
crosscut of 6000 feet to explore the
country in the most thorough manner.
The new Interests are in the district
to establish a series of new producers
7
in a new territory and they have
sufficient faith in the western tone
making into enormous ledges that all
the money to see the undertaking '
through haa been subscribed - and
placed in the treasury. Tljree shifts
will be employed and the . crosscut
will be driven from both ends at the
rate of about 600 feet a month. John
Magee will have charge of all three
properties under "direction of Bryce
Turner, consulting engineer. . ,
The Greenwater company enter
into a working arrangement with the
new company by which the abaft of
the Bonanza and Great Western are
utilized. The Great Western will,
continue the south crosscut, whera
rich stringers were evident when the
water rushed in and drowned the
pumps. This crosscut will also serve
to develop the Ruby group.
The importance of the- advent of
this capital in Tonopah cannot be
over eati'Siited,' since it .brings In
entire'. new blood .for- the opening
of rn entirely new district and sup-'
plies capital and experience auch us
is seldom seen in a combination of
such magnitude. 1

Midway is the new center of

The hydraulic season at Round

President L. D. Gordon states that
the Round Mountain Mining company

gravel a week by sluicing. The
gravel is conveyed by scrapers and
teams to a trap through which It is
dumped from an overhead roadway

IN NICE QUARTZ
The West Tonopah has attained to
a depth ot 1030 feet and sinking is
being continued, with a heavy flow of
water. The shaft has passed through
on a 45 degree angle a large and
promising vein of quartz yielding
small values. There will be no at
tempt made at this time to pick up
this vein on a level bs depth is what
is now desired. The new pumping
equipment Is working to complete
satisfaction and the water flow is
held under control.
East of the east ore body on the
311 level of the White Caps another
ore shoot has been picked up. It pre
serves the dip and trend of the other
shoots encountered on this remark
able level, which now shows five ore
bodies ot ore, each of which would
lift a property out of the prospect
stage.
The new body is from twelve to
fourteen feet in width at right angles
and the full face assays range from
$19.40 to $21.60. The ore is half
oxide and half sulphide. ' It carries
proportions of zinc and antimony
similar to the other shoots. This is
the second largest find on this level
and the management attaches great
Importance to It as it Is one that was
not reached on the level above and
may continue to or near the surface.
In which case It would yield about
500 feet of backs. The ore, having
similar characteristics, will undoubt
edly yield to the form ot treatment to
which the ore In the other lenses has
been found to be amenable. After
