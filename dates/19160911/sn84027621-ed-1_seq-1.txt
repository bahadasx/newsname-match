Five German attacks with liquid

tions on the Somme front were re
pulsed, Paris reports. London an
nounces that the Germans made two
unsuccessful attempts to recapture
Gvinchy, oh the Somme front, last
night.
CLOSING IN ON THE BULGARS
Attacks on Bulgaria from both
north and south are apparently being
prepared by the entente armies in the
Balkans. The British offensive direct
ed along the main -road to a point
north of Tahinos Lake, is the natural
avenue of advance for an army push
ing for the Bulgarian border. Mean
while an effort to surround Bulgaria
is proceeding on the north with the
reported arrival of strong forces of
Russian troops to take the offensive
against the Bulgarians invading Ru
mania. WILL CARE FOR POOR

Inoorer classes must not be exposed
during the coming winter to the dis
comforts they have suffered the past
few months," said Secretary Steger

Elaborate precautions are being
xaken to ensure a supply of potatoes,

Stegerwald also promises that the
prices of meat should soon be lowered
nnd the workers "employed on hard
hpysical labor would receive an extra
illowance of meat.

Court is Steadily Deciding Merits and
Demerits of the Knott
Catts Contest
(Special to the Times-Union)
Tallahassee, Sept. 9. The supreme
court puts it up to the members of
the state canvassing board to prove
their averments of fraud in Madison
and Hamilton counties as set out in
their return to the alternative writ of
the court directing them to reconvene
and canvass the amended returns of
the primary election, or show cause
why they should not. The return was
filed and argued yesterday and the
court handed down its opinion late
this afternoon, which is concurred in
by the four justices present. '
Reasons for Denying Writ
The main issues raised by the can-
vassing board as to why the alterna
tive writ should not be complied with
and the amended returns canvassed
were: .
First Pursuant to law they met on
June 26 and canvassed the returns of
the' primary election and declared the
results and there is no authority to
meet again and do the work over.
Second By affidavits on file with
the secretary of state there is evi
dence of fraud in the amended re
turns and evidence of the ballots and
boxes having been tampered with.
The court does not consider that
there is anything to the first issue and
disposes of it in short order, but as to
the second issue the court says it has
merit.'-' . ." V , -v:, '
"The last count', quoting from
opinion, "was made under order of the
circuit court. In its last analysis the
averment is nothing less than an im
putation of fraud upon the ' circuit
court's order and a challenge as to its
good faith. -,
Board Defendants in New Proceeding
"A charge so grave, emanating
from a source so high as three cab
inet officers of the state government,
cannot be ignored. It presents - an
issue as to the correctness of the!
amended returns as certified to the
secretary of state and the governor
underMhe order of the court. . ,
"They, the canvassing board, are
defendants in a new proceeding in
volving the performance of a public
duty and have the right to question
the validitys of the amended returns
made , under a court's order upon the
ground of fraud. The issue will have
to be met. The burden will be upon
the respondents to prove their aver
ments of fraud. .
"The motion 'to strike partsof the
answer is denied, so also is the motion
for a peremptory wrjt denied. Th
relator is given until Tuesday, the
12th inst., to join issue upon the aver
ment of fraud."
(By Associated Press)
Tallahassee, Sept, 9. The contest
of Comptroller V.- Knott for the
democratic - nomination for governor,
in which he seeks to show through a
recanvass of certain counties that he,
and not S. J. Catts, the declared nomi
nee, was the real nominee of the pri
mary of June 6 last, has taken a new
turn. The supreme court today di
retted the state canvassing board to
prove its ground for asserting, in re
fusing to make recanvass of the
amended returns, as sought by Knott,
that fraud was practiced by the Knott
contingent in making recount in Mad
ison and Hamilton counties. The board
must make its reply in court next
Tuesday. - . " . '.
The court says: "The last count was
made under order of-the circuit court.
In its last analysis the averment is
nothing" less than an imputation of
fraud upon the circuit court's . order

SPEECH OF A
GERMAN SOCIALIST
Following is Dr. Liebknecht's
speech, printed in the Potsdamerplatz,
Berlin, for which he was convicted of
treason and sentenced to two years
and a half in prison:
"Comrades, some time ago a witty
socialist democrat observed: 'We
Prussians are a privileged people. We
have the right to serve as soldiers,
we are entitled to bear upon our
shoulders the entire burden of taxa
tion, and we are expected to hold our
tongues.' So it is. The authorities
never cease to call upon us to keep
silent. Quite a simple thing hold
your tongue, that's all. Don't talk!
If you are hungry, don't talk! They
ask for milk hold your tongue! They
ask for bread don't say, a word!
"Comrades, we are starving, but no
one must know it least of all the
soldiers. Such news would weaken
the warlike spirit of the . fighters,
therefore, don't complain. Women,
hide away the truth from your own
men! Lie; don't tell the truth, lest the
soldiers in the trenches learn how
things stand. Prussian censorship
takes good care that this does not hap
pen. Poor German soldier, he really
deserves pity. Under the compulsion
of a warlike government he has in
vaded a foreign country, and is 'doing
his bloody work, suffering untold hor
rors. Death reigns on the battlefield
and "his children at home are suc
cumbing tohunger and want. The
poor mother is in distress and cannot
share her grief with her husband.
"The workers of Germany have to
bleed because such is the will of the
capitalists, of the superpatriots, of
the cannon makers. The people have
o make bloody sacrifices without a
murmur in order that these robbers
may mint gold out of theif' valuable
ives. The. war was ushered in -with a
ie, so that the workers would rush to
he battlefields, amhow: the lie still
presides over the continuance of this
awful carnage."
DIFFICULT TO TURN DOWN
A tall, elderly, shabbily dressed
man, a stranger, walked in upon .the
Sunday school class of Mr. M. M.
Little, at the Methodist church, yes-
erday morning. He represented him
self to be a minister, in need, and ask
ed ' permission ,to make a plea to the
class for assistance, He was "told that
permission to "address the class couldi
not be given him, but that he could
seek help from individuals. The man
behaved so badly, upon his request
being refused, that it was necessary
for Mr. Little to have him 'arrested.
This morning the stranger, whose
name is Joseph C. Normen, was ar
raigned before the city recorder on a
charge of disorderly conduct. Major
Izlar gave the man a lecture on his
behavior. The old fellow then turned
loose and. gave Major Izlar a lecture.

WOOD AND CATTS
Pat Murphy tells
story regarding the
the following
recent primary
campaign: -
"I was a little amused," said Pat,
"at the story Wood told me about
Catts. I knew Wood over in British
Columbia, and I must say that my ad
miration for him grew stronger when
I heard how he clawed Catts and how
he told the people of Florida what
manner of man this man Catts was.
But to the story: Wood met Catts in
joint debate at Winter Haven, and
told me about it. Said Wowt: 'Mur
hpy, I've been over to Winter Haven
in joint debate with Catts, and would
you think it, while I was talking to
those good people, Catts was busy
passing his hat around taking up a
collection! 'I said to Catts,' said Wood,
'wait until I get through.' Catts re
plied: 'Brother Wood, if I wait until
you get through the audience will be
all gone and I won't get anything.'
'I said to Wood,' said Pat, 'Did Catts
divide up. with you?' 'Divide h I,'
said WTood, 'do you think I'd take that
kind of money?' " And, with that, Pat
picked up "his hat and bid us "good
day."

LIBRARY IS OPEN
Ocala's new Carnegie library open
ed very informally this morning at 8
o'clock. All of the furnishings are
not yet installed, but it has been de
cided best not to delay the opening
any longer. Even before entirely
furnished, the library is most com
plete, and probably one of the most
complete in Florida. The latest card
index system has been adopted. Al
ready 17,000 cards have been made,
and more have yet to be made. Miss
Louise Gamsby, an experienced librar
ian, is to be in charge.
It is probable that later, when all
of the furnishings are in, and the
basement rooms are ready for, use,
there will be a public ceremony of
some kind.
The library board has tiecided on
the following hours, subject to
change, during which the building is
to be open: 8 o'clock to 10 o'clock a.
m., and 4 o'clock to 8 o'clock p. m., on
week days only.
The design of the building is a
combination of modified classical and
mission. A red tile roof and red
brick trimmings are used to break
the otherwise plain severity of the
stucco walls. The design was made
by Mr. W. C. Meade, of the firm of
Mclver & MacKay, of this city.
Mr. Meade very kindly prepared
the following description at the re
quest of the Star:
The size of the building is GO x 24'
outside measurements, exclusive of
entrance, extensions, of "which; there
are lwo, one to the front (north) and
one to the end (west).
The west entrance is designed to
give almost direct access to the base
ment assembly room, without in any
way interfering with " the library
proper.
The height of the stories is, base
ment approximately ten feet and main
room fourteen feet.
The elevation of basement above
grade line provides an abundance of
light and ventilation for the lower
rooms, making them as desirable for
the purposes for whic hthey are in
tended, as though located entirely
above grade. '
The size and number of windows on
the .rst floor also provide ample light
ing and ventilation for this flor.
The basement contains steam heat
ing plant, fuel room, men's and wom
en's toilets, work room and assembly
room, all amply large for their sev
eral uses, besides two large closets
opening from the assembly room. The j
entire basement floor is concrete.
treated with a special hardener un
derlaid with a filtering bed of cinders
which is in turn underdrained with
tile, leading several feet outside of
the walls of the building, thereby in
suring against da'mpness, as much as
it is possible to do so.
The assembly room is provided with
a speaker's platform, which being,
portable, will allow of any desire J
seating arrangement.
The main floor occupies the entire
size of the building, with tairway
directly to-basement, and is provided
with two coat and hat alcoves direct
ly adjoining the front entrancs.
This room is also supplied with a
large fireplace for use on damp or
chilly days, when the steam plant
would not be in operation
The shelving as provided approx
imates 4,200 lineal feet. This capa
city may be added to by the use of
stacks at any future time.
The floor of this room is quarter
sawed oak." The entire building is
finished in cypress, stained to match
as near as is possible, the tint of the
furniture. The walls and'ceilings be
ing in tans and ivory, harmonize with
the fumed nish of the furniture.
The lighting system is, in the main,
indirect, with all necessary provisions
for side lights and floor openings for
table reading lamps.

IS TOO CAUTIOUS
How the Kaiser Came to Turn Down
, -Jfalkenhayn and Put in
Hindenburg
(Associated Press)
London, Sept. , Hi "According to
reports from Germany received at
Berne," says a dispatch to the Wire
less Press, "the dismissal of General
Erich yon Falkenhayn as chief of the
German general staff was due to his
suggestion of a complete change in
Germany's war plans which Emperor
William indignantly rejected.
"Predicting i the complete downfall
of Bulgaria as the result of converg
ing attacks from the north and south
and in the end a consequent interrup
tion of communications with Turkey,
Gen. von Falkenhayn urged that the
whole Balkan campaign be abandon
ed, that the eastern line be shortened
and that the occupied territory in
France be evacuated,
"The general expressed the opinion
that the transformation of German
strategy into a purely defensive cam
paign on a shorter front would para
lyze the entente allies and make it
impossible forthem to crush Austro
German resistance unless they fought
with unlimited resources and then for
ten years. Persistence in the present
plan of campaign, he said, would lead
to disaster. .
"Fild Marshal von Hindenburg .de
nounced his advice as childish, cow-
ardly and unworthy of the Germans.
Emperor William took von Hinden
burg's view and dismissed vorv Falk
enhayn." ,

Sixteen or More Lives Lost this Morn
ing in the Wreck of the
Central Span

Lawrence river, the largest cantilever
bridge in the world, collapsed when
fteen feet in the air as it was being
hoisted into place this morning.
Ninety men were on the section,
which sank in two hundred feet 7f

The bridge was being constructed
at a cost of $17,000,000 in order to
shorten the railway journey from
Halifax to the Canadian northwest by
200 miles.- It stands on the sit of the
structure which collapsed August 29,
1907, with a loss of seventy lives.
CELEBRATION TURNED INTO
SORROW .
Many Canadian government offi
cials, including- cabinet members and
several thousand tourists saw the
bridge collapse. A special train has
arrived here with twenty of the injur
ed. It is estimated that the dead will
range from three to twenty-five, the

the St. Lawrence - Bridge Co! The
span was 640' feet long and weighed
five thousand tons. .
