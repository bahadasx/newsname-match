KOVEL. Russia, Aug. 16 (By mall).
The great "battle of bread" has Just

Tho Germans captured Zwlnlacze.

had Just turned out 10,000 loaves
when they wcro forced to rotlre. Tho
regiment on their left flank had fail
ed to advance, and the retirement at
Zwlnlacze was necessary to straight
en the lines.
The Germans entrenched a few hun
dred yards on one side of tho village.
Tho Russians entrenched about the
same distance on the other aide.
A group of Germans slipped Into
Zwinlaczo and started back with all
the bread they could cgrry. The Rus
sians saw them. but. Instead of firing,
slipped out of their trenches for a
raid on the bakery.
The Austrlana Jumped In, and for a
few minutes Russians. Germans, and
Austrlans met at the army bakery
with their arms too full of bread to
fight.
But when the supply began to run
low some one drew a knife. The bat
tle was on In an Instant, with both
sides rushing up re-enforcementa
Before It ended the ground about the
bakery was atrewn with th bodtea
of dead Russians. Austrlans, and Ger
mans, some of them still clutching
their loaves of bread.

prevent, if possible, a raise In the
price of milk and fcread In the District

If It la not possible, and the present
Indications are that a raise In the price
Is Inevitable, the Government experts

be given the most reasonable treatment
that can be obtained for him.
The Federal Trade Commission haa

Investigation.
Assistant Secretary Carl Vrooman, of
tho Department of Agriculture, entered
tho milk controversy today at the re

Mr. Vrooman met the committee
more than half way with the state

and Intended to utilise all the re
sources of the department to help

Furthermore, the Assistant Secretary
said the milk situation Is threatening

some cities, notably New York, It la
even more acute than in Washington.
The department Is prepared to go
Into this matter, therefore, to the

the New York traction companies to
"crush unionism" Is the first direct re

by Congress to prevent a railroad strike,
a statement from the Amalgamated As

"Capital does not Intend that this
legislation shall ever go on the statute
books," the statement declared. "The
New York traction companies are
backed by the most powerful aggrega
tion of capital In the world. The same
financial Interests back the railroads of
tho country. This attempt to crush
unionism is tho first step In a great
light by capital against organized labor,
that it may not realize the results of a

The span, which weighs about 6,000
tons, was towed to the bridge alto
early thla morning and was being
hoisted 160 feet by specially con

fell from a distance of about fifteen
feet into the river.
Tho placing of the central span had
been heralded as one of the greatest
engineering feats of the worad, and
a commlasion of experts from Great
Britain, .Germany, and the United

This Is the second catastrophe at

Warren K. Billings, Ex-Convict,
Before Jury.
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. U. The first
of the bomb cases resulting from the
murder of ten persons by the explo
sion of ix n Internal machine In a suit
case planted In the preparedness parade
crowd here July 12, began today, when
Warren K. Billings, principal suspect,
went to trial.
The theory of the prosecution Is that
Billings and his confederates were not
anti-preparedness cranks, as at first was
supposed, but sought to kill employes of
the local United Railroads, a division of
which would have been passing the
bomb suitcase at the moment It exploded
If the parade hadn't been delayed.
Thomaa J. Mooney, also Indicted for
nnmnlicltv In the bomb. plot, unsuccess
fully had tried to organize a strike among
these employes, and the prosecution will
claim tho bomb waa used to. get even
with tne men.
The trials of the four other defendants
Mooney, his wife, Mrs. Rena Mooney,
Israel Weinberg, and Edward Nolan
will be held later.
Evidence of a sensational character Is
expected to be given.
The prosecution Is baaed on the theory
that Billings, under Instructions from
Mooney, planted the bomb; that Mrs.
Mooney was ah accessory before nnd
after the fact; that Nolan either manu
factured or assisien in manufacturing
hn hnmh. and that Welnberc waa an
accessory In that ho transported the con-

Four persons were killed outright, and
the paraders panic-stricken when the

Asleep in Bunks.
The four victims were lying tn their
bunks In the little cabin at o'clock
this morning. The barge. No. 74, of
the Consolidation Coal Company, was
discharging coal at the car company's
dock.
Suddenly there waa a crash of
glass, and steam burst through the
window of tho cabin. Immediately
tha small compartment waa filled
with scalding water, and the woman
and her children screamed frantically
as they tried to escape.
For ten minutes they struggled be
fore they could get the cabin door
open. As thev emerged they fell
fainting to the deck, their night
clothes in shreds and their flesh livid
from the scalding. They were rushed
unconcslous to the hospital.
At the time of the accident the window
of the barge cabin was Just opposite the
place where the exhaust pipe from the
traction plant dipped down toward the
water.
Taken to Hospital.
The injured wero taken to the Gesrg
town Untverslty Hospital and given med
ical attention, but their lives are des
paired of there, as the burns are of such
n character as to render recovery almost
Impossible.
Police headquarters received the news
of tho accident about 7.30 o'clock, and
at once sent out a man. The Seventh
precinct had several men Investigating
the case, but little could be learned.
Detectives Hewlltt and Scrivener took
the case In charge, and are trying to
ascertain on whose shoulders blnme
should fall.
It seems that It Is the custom of the
power plant to "blow out" tho boilers
every morning early. The exhaust p'.pe
runs out over the Potomac, and has an
elbow turning It down toward the sur
face of the water.
The theory of the accident held bv
the police Is that tho threads of this
elbow were much worn, or It had a
very loose connection, and that the
Pressure of the ninety-pound steam
elng "blown off" caused the elbow
to come oft, and the whole force of
the steam directed at ihe little canal
boat and Its sleeping occupants.
Fireman Denies Responsibility.
It is the duty of a fireman at the
plant to "blow off" the boilers every
morning, but upon being questioned
by Detectives Hewlltt and Scrivener
this morning he disclaimed any re
sponsibility, and said that some one
else must have opened the valve this
morning.
The police say the elbow, which was
said to have been blown off, could not
have been deteriorated from age, for
the plant at the foot of Wisconsin
avenue Is a compsratlvely new one,
not having been In operation over
three years.
