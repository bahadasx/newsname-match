Mr. Samuel Tully Farrow, promi
nent contractor of this city met death
suddenly Saturday morning about 11
o'clock when he was overcome by sew er
gas while inspecting a sewer a
the foot of Government street.
There being some little controversy
over the size of the postofflcc sewer
emptying Into the main sewer at this
point Mr. Farrow decided to Investi
gate. Mr. Huff, the poBtofflce cus
todian, was of the opinion thnt the
outlet was slxi inches In diameter but
Mr Farrow was of a different opinion
Deciding to investigate the matter,
he had the manhole at this point open
ed and entered. The hole Is about
fifteen feet deep. When Mr. Farrow
had descended a short distance he fell
from the ladder as If In a faint. One
of his workers, Stanley Green, a col
ored man, descended to rescue hln.
but was also, overcome by the winies
of the gas and had to be drawn out
himself. The negro suffered no incon
viences from the gas except at firs!
An Ice hook was used to raise the leg
of the asphyxiated man. around which
a rope was thrown and he was hauled
tc the surface. Dr. A. O. Taylor was
summoned and although he worked
heroically the spark of life had fled
Mr. Samuel Tully Farrow was born
in Mt. Gllead, Mason county, July 23,
1S58, and was 58 years of age at the
timo of his death. Me was a gradu
ate of Antloch College and the Cincin
nati Law School. Although a learned
scholar, having graduated with high
honors from the latter school, he did
not practice law for any length of time
but returned to the home of his par
ents und worked on the farm for a
number of years. In 1H0L' he became
.1 partner in a contracting firm and
two years later moved to HiIb city
where he lias lived since. He served
two years as magistrate of the county
In April, 1882, he was married to
Miss Ella Vanden. To them a ere
born seven children, five of whom sur
vive; Mrs. M. J. Guilfoyle, Mrs.
Charles Sweet, Clarke Farrow, Made
line Farrow and James Farrow. He
is also survived by his mother, one
sister. Mrs. L T. Gacbke, and two
brothers. Messrs. R. C. and C. H.
Karrort'.
Mr, Farrow was probably one of the
most well liked men In the county and
numbered his friends by the score?
Bluff, hearty, he had a good word for
all and was always willing to help
some one. He was a member of tbrj
local orders of Redmeu and Elks.
The funeral will be held this after
noon from his late home on East Front,

EARLY FALL SUITS
These are suits that will look the part of fashion through the winter, that will
never be "freakish," yet will always be distinctive and smart. The designers have
caught the prophecy of fashion and made it real. All prices from $15 to $50.
STOCKINGS FOR SERVICE
Nobody can test the quality of hosiery like a romping sturdy child. That is
why we are so careful in choosing hosiery and how afttr many seasons of exper-
s ience we can safely recommend Round Ticket Stockings as the "wear-evcrs" for
children. No war dye excuse lessens their value for the deep rich black is fast
