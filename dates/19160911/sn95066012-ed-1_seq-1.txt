WORKMEN KILLED AND DROWNED
About Ninety were Engaged on
Structure When Accident
Occurred.
Montreal, Sept. 11 The central
span of the transcontinental bridge
nt Quebec fell this morning while be
ing lifted Into position. The accident
was accompanied by heavy loss of life,
hut as yet no accurate estimate of the
Killed and drowned can be made.

about 50 feet into the river.
The bridge was being constructed to
shorten the distance between Halifax

The bridge was 8889 feet long from
shore to shore and the central span
was 640 feet long.

THE ATTACK ON WEEKS
Convincing Reply Made by Col. Thad
M. Chapman.
Col. Thad M. Chapman, former
chairman of the Republican state com
mittee makes the following convinc
ing reply to the eleventh hour attack
on Judge Weeks by the liurltngton
Free Press:
Kditor of the Free Press: in your
issue of September 8 you express
some fear that in case Judge Weeks is
elected Lieutenant Coventor he will
be extravagant and wasteful of the
people s money. As a neighbor of
Judge Weeks, and one who has ob
served his administration of both pub-
lie and private affairs for u;any years.
I can assure you that yqur fears are
giouiidtess. judge weens is a ccreiui,
prudent business man, not afraid to
spend a dollar when it Is necessary
and will bring good return, but al
ways careful to make every dollar go
as far as possible.
You give the increased cost of the
Industrial School, but you do not
state that the attendance has increas
ed. There are now nearly 300 chil
dren In the school, 888 the last I
knew. Fight years ago there were
only 186. Of course it is bound to
cost more when you more than double
the number of children.
rhe cost per child Is only $192.60
mil that includes board, lodging.
clothing, medical attendance, school
ing, and everything vise. 1 for one
say that is none too much. At any
rate it Is lower than in any other state
In New England and much lower than
in such states as New York. Pennsyl
vania, and New Jersey. In some of
them it costs as high as $4i per child
in schools like ours.
Of course we could have a jail for
the boys and girls, and feed them on
bread and water, and it would cost
less, but the people of Vermont would
not want to do that. We have one of
the best reformatory schools in the
country and are prout of it, and it
has been almost entirely rebuilt in re
cent years, and it is due to Judge
Weeks very largely that we have got
ten so much for our money. Ask any
body who ever got a contract out of
him whether they think he is extrava
gan:.
It is true more money has been
spent on the House of Correction hut
you omit to explain that the buildings
were in such condition that they had
to be thoroughly repaired, that it was
absolutely necessary to Install a wat
er svstem. and that an electrical plant
has been put in which Is saving the
state money every day.
Judge Weeks is not icspnnsihlc for
the number of prisoners at Windsor
as they are sent there by the courts
Everybody knows there are more than
there used to be. Six years ago
there were L75, and recently the mini
her has been as high as 1MJ. It costs
money to keep them, ami more nioiie
to provide buildings and equipment for
them to use. I do not believe there is
a man In Vermont who could have pro
vided these things more economically
than .Indue Weeks.
There is not an Institution in Ver
mout, a school, or a lactory, or a
newspaper, that is not spending morr
money than it did ten years ago
I'rices have gone up. It is unfair to
put the responsibility of the Increased
cost of everything on an efficient pub
lb e officer.
It is true that Judge Weeks was one
of thole Who favored giving more than
flftv cents a dav to our boys who
went to the front when every one
thought there would be war with Mexi
co. just as was done in the Spanish
war and In the Civil war. Hut if tin
time has come when it counts against
a man in Vermont to vote fair wagt
to Vermont Volunteer soldiers, many
of whom have left wife and little Ottl
to stand by the colors, some of us want
to know it. I guess Jlidse Weeks
would ratlur not be Lieutenant GOV
ernor than to taxc nacx ins vote or
his Influence on that point.
You say Judge Weeks has had deal
lugs with wealthy men and learned to
spend inonev. The reason Colonel
llsley and Mr. Hepburn tie to Judge
Weeks in what they do for Vermont Is
because they know they can get good
results in anything he manages. It Is
just such men who are most careful
that every dollar Is spent wisely.
I here mav be reasons why you
should support .Mr Hulbiird. hut tin
arguments you advance in opposition
to Judge Weeks are not sound. He Is
a plain man. eionomical in his person
al habits and as a public officer. II
laved the state thousands of dollar
two years ago by assisting towiud
abort and economical legislature. II
will never stand lor the waste of pub
lie money and the fanners and worl
lug people know that he is a mail tin
can trust to keep cxpojiscs down in
every reasonable way.

The Needless Call to the Border.
It is to be hoped that we may learn
the practical lessons of a military
kind that our movement of the regular
army 111 .March, and our experience
with the National Guard system in
June and July, can afford us if we
know how to acouire benefit from ex
perience. The dominating lesson to
be learned is the futility of-our expen
sive and inefticient scheme of nation
al defense. The olllcers of our regit
lar army are well trained and afford
us an excellent nucleus. Hut our
method ot enlisting men in the regular
army is obsolete and worthless. As
for the National Guard, it is made up
of much spl.'f.did material, wholly ill
assortud. lit eiioimh to serve the coun
try in a small way for purposes of
home defense, but wholly untlt to be
transferred on momentary notice to
tbe national service and shipped sever
al thousand miles to meet a foreign
emergency. We have now, perhaps,
ninety thousand National Guardsmen
in Texas and elsewhere along the
frontier. Moat of these are Ironi New
York and the cast. Many of them are
married men with families dependent
upon their weekly wages or monthly
salaries, it is grotesquely unfitting
that they should he kept in camps for

CARRIER" SPREADS DYSENTERY
Man Held Responsible for 194 Cases
at Poughkeepsie.
Albany, N. Y..' Sept. 7. Principal
responsibility for the spread of dysen
tery in l'oughkeepsie, which for a
time threatened epidemic proportions,
but which now is rapidly dying out,
has been attributed to one man who
has been classed a "dysentery car
rier" and isolated, it was announced
at the state health department today.
Reports received today from the
l'oughkeepsie sanitary supervisor rec
ords l'J4 cases since the first one was
discovered on July 22. Since that
date, according to the figures given
out at the state department, 41 per
sons have died from intestinal dis
eases of all kinds, 13 of the deaths be
ing attributed directly to dysentery.
MAINE G. O. P. IS CONFIDENT
Nothing Is In Doubt Except the Size of
the Majority.
Augusta, Me., Sept. 8. Republicans
afamakjng a whirlwind finish in their
state campaign. The last word will be
said by Charles E. Hughes in Rock
land, a Democratic city, Saturday
night. Hughes and Fairbanks are
both into the state today. The eve
of election finds the campaign at
fever heat. Nothing like it has been
seen in .Maine, old time politicians
sar, in 20 years, in many respects
it recalls the Maine-Cleveland cam-
aign ot 1884. Keputiliean leaders,
flushed with confidence, say nothing
in doubt except the size of the Ke-
publican plurality.
With the candidate for president
and the candidate lor vioepresident
both arousing party enthusiasm i there
no danger ot a slump between now
and next Monday. On the contrary.
Republican leaders look forward to
days of unexampled activity. They
say the presence of Hughes and his
speeches assures a record breaking
Republican vote. It is estimated the
vote this year will exceed by 10,000
that tast in the state election two
years ago. A presidential year al
ways brings out a full Republican
vote.
Party managers say the excess vote
will he almost wholly Republican. I

Result May Determine Future Con
trol of Upper House of
Congress.
Arlington, Me., Sept. 11 A rousing
vote at the state election in Maine to
day is predicted. The day promises to
be fair. The weather is the one fac
tor that the politicians have not at
tempted to influence by argument and
fireworks, and the forecast was anxi
ously awaited. Last night there was
rejoicing in both the republican and
democratic camps, for It was expected
that the expression of Maine's opin
ion on state and national policies
would he a decisive and both
sides faced the issue with Confidence.
After a Sunday of comparative rest
and review, and dining Whicl the heat
of battle cooled somewhat, l.ie party
managers declared that they stood by
the figures proclaimed at the close of
the campaign Saturday night. The
republicans claim everything with
pluralities approximating lu.onn. The
democrats make a similar claim, ex
cept that they set the pluralities at
linen and admit that the outcome in
the third and fouith congressional (lis
