ANSWERS WASTE CHARGE
Shows Conclusively That the
Tax Laws of the State Are
Not a Failure.
'?PICIAL TO TMf 'lliamti i
madison. sept. 11.?John ahor-;
man Darst, Republican nominee for |
stat?? auditor, nddressed nn immense
audience here toda>. lie said:
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentle
men :
It is a pleasure to have the privi
lege of addressing you. I have been
working for you for Rome time, and
do not hnve the opportunity to nee
many of the people who employ me,
to give them an account of my stew
ardship. Hence. It is a pleasure to i
look Into your face? and talk to you
| about your business.
I am here to give you, as you have j
a right to know, a condensed state
ment of the stewardship of the men;
whom 3*0u have entrusted with the ?
safeguarding of your Interests. With '
these facts in your possession, then
you will be able to form your own 1
conclusions.
Once more the Republican party \
has been placed on trial In this state j
by our common enemy, the Democrat- 1
ic party. We are again accused of
wasting the people's money. This Is
a reiteration of the charges made two
years ago, four years ago and six
years ago, but you recall, in these j
three campaigns, when wo got the'
rocords before the people of the state. 1
they wore not only convinced that we !
had not been wasting their money,
but that we were giving them more
for their money than any other state j
In the Union. So much have our bus- J
Iness methods attracted the attention '
of other states that they have sent!
their ofTlclals here to learn more!
about them, and upon their return '
home, have advocated the enactment
of similar laws for their own states.
But in each campaign for years, our ,
enemies have accused us with wast
ing the people's money, and we have I
met their accusations by giving the
facts, and the result has been that the
voters have placed their stamp of ap
proval upon the Republican party by'
continuing its representatives In
power.
I did not expect to hear th* same 1
old cry again this year that the tax
laws are a failure and that we were j
wasting the people's money. Rut it
has been made, and I am glad to have j
the opportunity to reply.
Mr. Corn well's Prophecy.
Mr. Cornwell, Democratic candidate
for governor, in his speech at Clarks
burg, W. Va.. on April 19, 1016, re
calls a prophecy made by him In 1004
and calls attention to Its fulfillment ,
in the following words:
"Your taxes since then have gone
up, up, until In many cases proper-'
ties are assessed seven, ten and fif
teen times as much as they were as- I
sessed In 1903. They have now laid J
a levy of fourteen cents, and many a i
man who has property is paying today 1
five times as much as he paid with a 1
thirty-five cent levy under the old
plan. Why is that? I know of no
better explanation than in a speech
I made in the city of Wheeling in j
1904. I said:
" 'It does not take a prophet to tell
what is going to happen to the tax |
payers In the state; the adoption of:
these laws means a steady increase of
taxation until becomes so outrageous
that the people will revolt; the bring
ing about of a political machine so
powerful that nothing short of a rev
olution will free the people from Its
grasp. Thus will taxes so enormously j
Increase that all those who have voted
for these laws will feel like organiz
ing a vigilance committee to go to
Charleston and hang those who have
so grossly deceived them.' "
Has Mr. Cornwell's prophecy come
true, and has property been assessed
seven, ten and fifteen times as much
as it was assessed in 1903? And if
this be true, whose property was it?
Was It unjust to raise It, or was It
right to do so? What class of prop
ertyls paying five times as much taxes
