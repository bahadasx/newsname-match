With the rain clouds disappearing
and the sun flirting behind the flying
clouds, the directors of the Big Free
Fair drew a sigh of relief this after
noon. They promise to make good
their. effort to give Kansas the best
fair in history In fact, the rain of
the morning is Just what O. M. Keats,
superintendent of speed, wanted.
"A good rain makes the speedway
for Tuesday the fastest in twenty
years." said Mr. Keats. The big races
will begin promptly at 2 o'clock Tues
day afternoon.
The Johnny J. Jones shows opened
late this afternoon. Practically every
show is ready for business. This eve
ning all shows will be open.
A motley crowd of showmen, church
women with eating booths, concession
men, exhibitors, farmers and Tope
kans braved the threatening rain
clouds of the early morning. All
seemed to be hubbub and confusion
but as the hours rolled on. order ap
peared cut of chaos and the Big Free
Fair presented its normal appearance.
Down on Kansas avenue, visitors,
too, realized that something was doing
at the fair grounds. A man with a
voice like a trumpet, dressed as a po
liceman, drove up and down in a cart
drawn by a pair of goats announcing
the wonders of the fair. Street cars
dragging trailers made scheduled trips.
Seventeen extra conductors arrived
this morning to aid the street railway
company during the coming week.
Brave Crowd There.
Out at the fair grounds one saw
farmers standing in front of the ex
hibits, not saying much but seeing
everything and making mental notes
which will stick in their minds until
the next big free fair. Topeka girls
waded through the wet grass, ruining
perfectly good pairs of white stockings
much in evidence.
Amusements This Evening.
Among the amusements on the
Sunflower Trail this evening will be:
trained wild animals, eight perform
ing midgets in high class vaudeville.
Witching Waves. World of Living

Near the Sunflower Trail conces
sion men were piling hundreds of
dolls, boxes of candies and sofa pil
lows in orderly and tempting arrays.
By 11 o'clock the concession men
with the candy boxes and the race
track were getting the dimes of the
hundreds of small boys in the grounds
since 8 o'clock.
A Scarcli for Room.
Over in the hog and sheep sheds,
Supt. W. J. Cody was endeavoring to
find room for more swine and sheep
than he had space to accommodate.
One extra tent was pitched for the ac
commodation of swine exhibitors

and another to accommodate exhib
itors of sheep. Both the sheep and
swine exhibits surpass those of pre
vious years. Exhibitors spent the
morning in bare feet washing the
monstrous swine, looking over the ex
hibits of their rivals and getting ac
quainted. In the Fine Arts building, superin
tendents and assistant superintendents
of the culinary, art and textile depart- , may be expected to enroll later in the

6,500 entries. The exhibits this year
are larger in quantity, better in qual
ity, better staged in more space than
ever before in the history of the f..ir,
he stated. Tho the drouth has been
looked upon as killing the corn crop
U a great extent, the exhibits of corn
are excellent. What exhibits there
are are exceptionally go d. The new
cereals, Pudan grass and feterita. are
being exhibited extensively. The larg
est watermelons ever seen in Topeka
are "' display.
BIk Santa Fe Display.
? -ostlineM and cenic effect the
exhibit of the Santa Fe Railroad com
pany in Agricultural hall surpasses
all. The aim of the Santa Fe's exhibit
is to indicate the various lines of the
road running through the greatest
corn and wheat country in the T'nited
States. A huge stack of wWeat and
corn has been built through which a
1 miniature train 13 run. On one side
of the exhibit one may see the engine
while on the other side may be seen
a miniature observation car. A huge
electric light is hung directly over the
exhibit and it will be at its best in the
evenings.
Fifteen hundred birds are on dis
play in the poultry barn, according to
Supt. Thomas Owen. The poultry I
show also surpasses thope of previous i
vears. Exhibitors have come to To- 1
peka from Nebraska. Oklahoma, Iowa, J
Arizona, Illinois, Missouri and Texas.
The Buff Cochin exhibit is the largest.
A. T. Modlin of Topeka has the largest

exhibit of 275 birds. Buck & Floyd
of Oklahoma City, have 200 birds here.
Cattle Barns Overflowing.
Two barns are filled to overflowing
with exhibits of beef breeding cattle,
steers and dairy cattle. There are 3 74
beef breeding cattle, thirty fat steers
and 182 dairy cattle exhibited. The
exhibit this year is not quite as large
as it was at the 1915 fair, but the qual
ity is much better. Guernseys and
Ayrshires were not exhibited last year.
There are good exhibits of both breeds
this year. Dr. F. S. Rchoenleber of
Linwood has a herd of twenty-two
Guernseys while William Galloway of
Waterloo. Ia., has a herd of fifteen.
The State Agricultural college at
Manhattan has a herd of nine steers.
The largest herd exhibited is that of

Friday evening 7:30 Faculty reception
at "White House."
Nearly 90 students from a dozen
states will start enrolling at Washburn
I College tomorrow morning. The in
I creasing reputation of the college is
shown in the presence of students
from such outlying states as Pennsyl
vania, Texasand North Dakota, Near
ly 100 of the total are from Nebraska,
Oklahoma, Missouri, and Iowa. To
peka is expected to send about one
half the total attendance. Showing
the influence of the endowment cam
paign is the registration of many stu
dents from Kansas towns who have
hitherto supported other Kansas col
leges.
Better Engineering Course.
Owing to the enlargement of the
engineering courses the school of en
gineering shows a big increase in en
rollment to date and other students
course in sanitary engineering will be
offered.
Another engineering departure which
is to be started a little later will be
work in "technical trades," the courses
in which will largely be offered at
night. This furnishes shop men who
have been taking correspondence work
in various trades an opportunity to
complete their studies in an actual
school.
Technical Work.
"We expect this to be one of the big
features of the future Washburn, '
Professor Tillotson of the engineer
ing department, announced today.
"There is not a technical trades school
worthy of the name in this entire sec
tion of the west and there is an in
creasing demand for one. Railroads
and several large manufacturing con
cerns in Kansas are enthusiastically
for the establishment of such a de
partment here."
From two to three years' work will
be offered in electrical engineering,
architecture, architectural engineer
ing, mechanical engineering.
In Law School.
The law school expects an increase
in its enrollment of about 25 per cent
according to Dean Hughes.
No definite figures can be obtained
on the enrollment in the fine arts de
partment but the strengthening of the
musical faculty by the addition of five
new professors is expected to assure a
j substantial increase.

Surface Lines Tied Up Car
men Appeal to Public.
New York, Sept. 11. An order rec
ommending a general strike of New
York's 800,000 trade unionists in sym
pathy with the transit strike which to
day affected New York, Bronx and
Queens counties, went out to the union
heads today.
Leaving the night session of union
heads two hours before it closed, Sam- i
uel Gompers, president of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor, recommend
ed that union members give the strik
ing carmen "financial and moral sup
port." The union heads recommended
a general strike with which action
they claimed Gompers was in com
plete sympathy. The union committee
which will direct the proposed gen
eral strike, opened headquarters to
day and will be in daily session.
The recommendation of the confer
ences held by leaders last night will
go the the individual bodies and it
is said it would take several days to
get the proposed sympathetic strike
under way.

at a standstill the strikers are today
making an appeal to the public to re
frain from using surface, subway and
elevated lines upon which strikes are

EMBARGOJN WHEAT?
Bxperts Predict Shipments From U. S.
Will Be Stopped Soon.
Chicago, 111., Sept. 11. An em
bargo on the exportation of wheat
from the United States may be de
clared in the near future, according
to experts.
This would mean a lowering of
prices In North America, as well as
elsewhere.
The quality of the wheat now being
harvested is poor. Prbminent millers
say that while under ordinary condi
tions it requires 4 bushels of wheat
to make a barrel of flour, it will now
require a much larger amount be
cause of the inferior wheat. The
quality is below normal in the great
fields of the northwest and in the win
ter wheat belt much light weight grain
has been threshed.
AFTER PLANK, NOT JOB
Hanly's Aim to Get Other Parties to
to Recognize lrys.
Fargo, X. D., Sept. 11. "I have no
chance to be elected president of the
United States," J. Fran!: Hanly, Pro
hibition presidential candidate, told
an audience here today, "but I expect
anyhow enough votes to show other
parties the ever-growing Prohibition
sentiment, and force them to adopt
Prohibition planks in their 1920 plat
form." After a day of rest provided for in
the national Prohibition party plat
form, Hanly's voice was much im
proved. Dr. D. M. Bottoms, a mem
ber of the candidate's party, sprayed
Hanly's throat today.
The candidate and his party are
traveling on a special train. They
passed quickly thru Minnesota. Stops
will be made today at Grand Forks,
L rimore. Devils Lake an3. Minot. To
morrow they will be in Montana and
Wednesday in Washington.
HALTllVE CHARGES
Germans Try Desperately But in Vain
to Recapture Trenches.
Paris. Sept. 11. The Germans
launched five attacks against the
French lines south of the Somme be
tween Berny and a point south of
Chaulnea last night, using liquid fire.
All these attacks were checked by
artillery fire, the Germans losing
heavily.
British Repulse Counter Attacks.
London, Sept. 11. Two German
counter attacks last night against the
village of Ginchy, captured by Irteh
j regiments Saturday, were driven off,
; General Haig reported thia afternoon.
1 The Germans also attacked near
! Mouquet Farm, but were driven back.
j Otherwise there were no important

Throwing Lines East and Jforth
Around Defenders.
Paris, Sept. 11. British troops on
the front in Greek Macedonia took the
offensive last night. They crossed the
Struma river, the war office an
nounced today, and attacked the Bul
garians, who are resisting desperately.
The British troops crossed the Stru
ma under fire. Having gained a foot
ing on the eastern bank at a point
about forty miles northeast of Sa
lonika they attacked the villages oi
Nevolen and Karabjabes.
Russ-Rumanians Retreat Further.
Berlin, Sept. 11. More than a third
of the territory taken from Bulgarians
by the Rumanians at the close of the
second Balkan war has been recon
quered by the German-Bulgarian
forces. The Rumanians and Russians
are again in retreat toward the Dan
ube, abandoning still more positions
east and southeast of the Fortress of
Silistra, said Budapest dispatches to
day. In a little more than a week the
combined German and Bulgarian
forces have captured far more Ru
manian territory than ?ie allies have
been able to take of German territory
since the beginning of the war.
Two Rumanian fortresses, Tutrakan
and Silistra, have fallen to the in
vaders. The Rumanian and Russian
prisoners now total more than 30,000.
Large captures of guns have seriously
affected the Rumanian artillery sup
ply. The capture of Silistra, officaily
announced yesterday afternoon, is ex
pected to cause the early withdrawal
of the Russo-Rumanian forces still
operating near Dobric, in southeastern
Rumania.
Have Defenders in a Pocket.
The force that occupied Silistra is
advancing eastward while a Bulgarian
army continues to move northward
along the Black sea coast. The enemy
already is in a deep pocket and on
eastward advance of twenty miles by
me Germans win mane nis withdrawal
aiincuit.
Whether the German-Bulgarian art
vance marks the beginning of a real
drive on Bucharest, newspaper critics
(.-unless iney are unable to decide. In
some quarters, it is believed the Ger
mans pian to drive the Russians and
Rumanians behind the Danube and
the Constanza railway and throw up
strong defensive lines to check a
Russo-Rumanian march on Bulgaria,

proposals. Under tbe state law the
minimum wage and maximum hour
for women may be established on ap

LARGEST BRIDGE IN WORLD
Structure Costing $17,000,000
Built by Railroads.
Bridge Collapsed in 1907 Cost
Seyenty Lives.
Quebec, Sept 11. The central span
of the world's greatest bridge col
lapsed and fell into the St. Lawrence
river at 10 o'clock today with a. lose
of life variously estimated as high aa
twenty-five. The company erecting
the structure placed the number of
deaths at this figure, but H. P. Bor
den, a member of the Quebec bridge
commission declared that only three
persons were lost. Several hours after
the accident happened, a special train
into Quebec brought twenty men who
had been injured.
Nine years ago, a similar accident
at the same spot took a toll of seventy
lives.
Today ninety men were carried into
the river when the 640 foot 6.000-ton
span being raised from pontoons In
an engineering feat designed to com
plete the 1 17,000,000 cantilever sus
pension bridge for transcontinental
railways' traffice, fell fifteen feet into
the water and sank 200 feet, perhaps
never to be recovered.
Contradictory stories were told re
garding the collapse. The pontoons
had been removed and the span was
being lifted by massive hydraulic
jacks, when, according to some of the
spectators, the northern end fell with
the breaking of girders. Frantic ef
forts were made to place a chain rope
around the tottering structure, but
with reports like shells exploding, the
remaining supports snapped and the
span disappeared with a tremendous
splash. Some of the observers said the
structure also buckled at the center as
it fell. Groups of men at work slipped
off into the water and others were
knocked off by flying debris. Scores
of craft containing spectators went to
the rescue and their endeavors pre
vented a larger loss of life. "
Ninety Men on When It Fell.
The collapse occurred when the
span was about fifteen feet In the
air. Early indications were that the
loss of life would be heavy for there
were ninety men on the structure
when it fell. Some of these have been
rescued. Boats from among the hun
dreds of craft on which spectators had
gathered were rushed to the spot
where the span disappeared. The
fallen structure sank 200 feet to the
bottom of the river, and engineers
who witnessed the collapse expressed
doubts as to whether it would ever be
brought up again.
First Structure Collapsed.
Later Canadian engineers obtained
a charter and, after many years of
delay, the building was begun, only
to terminate in the collapse of the
unfinished structure in 1907.
Canada's federal railway department
then decided to reconstruct it, and
placed the undertaking in the hands
of a commission which included sev
eral noted American bridge builders,
among them Ralph Modjeski, of Chi
cago, and C. C. Schneider, of New
York.
The plans for the bridge provided
for a channel span longer than that
of any existing today anywhere. Its
contemplated length from shore to
shore was 3,239 feet, with a distance
of 1,800 feet between anchor but
tresses. Provision was made for two
railroad tracks, two street car tracks
and two roads. It was to be used by
the following railroads: Canadian
Pacific. Grand Trunk, Quebec Central
Intercolonial. Quebec ana Lake St.
