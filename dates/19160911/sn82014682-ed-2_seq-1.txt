Maine's state elections take place
today and the prediction Is that the
rock-ribbed state will go Republican.
Robert W. Breckons. Republican
national committeeman for Hawaii,
yesterday received private cabled ad
vices right from the center of political
knowledge In the East. The message
said: -
Governor, senator, three represen
tatives sure. Probable sweep."
Maine elects two senators and four
representatives today and If a clean
sweep or even six out of seven is
achieved by the G. O. P., it will be a
big feather in the Republican cap and
a forecast of victory In the national
election In November. Maine ! nor
mally Republican but. the voting is
always considered a "keynote" to the

has held a lease on tne building, using

Find Doors Locked
This morning, when the teachers
marched their charges to the building,
they found the place locked and two
officers of the Chinese society, who
were on guard, told them that they
could not enter the structure. So the
students found seats under the trees
and waited. In the meantime a con

Preference is Given to Those
of Hawaiian or Part

Students of nationalities other than
Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian will be
admitted to the Kamehameha schools
during the coming year providing they
can be accommodated.
This announcement is made in the
school catalogue, recently published.
for the year 1916-17, copies of which
have heen mailed to former students
and graduates of the institution.
Although some Hawaiian graduates
claim that the plan of the school to
admit students other than Hawaiian
or part-Hawaiian is a new one, botn
the trustees of the Bishop estate and
their attorneys declare that It Is a
policy which has been in vogue for a
number of years.
