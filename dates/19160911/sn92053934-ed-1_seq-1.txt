STUDY PROBLEMS
Return of American Troops Seen ad
Basis for Flans Dealing With
Police Control of Border.
Nsw London, Conn., Sept. 11. The
American-Mexican joint commission
resumed today its effort to find a solu
tion for the problems along the inter
national boundary. This was the third
joint session. Luis Cabrera, chair
man cf the Mexican delegation, presid
ed. Since their meeting three days ago
the American members have devotea
much time to a study of government
reports on the various phases of the
problem.
They are counting also on the per
sonal knowledge of the situation which
Major General Tasker H. Bliss will be
able to supply on his arrival from
Washington. Before the meeting be
gan Secretary Lane expressed confi

So far there has been nothing more
than general mention of the Mexican
request that General Pershing's forces
be withdrawn from Mexico. The basis
of the plans for policing the line that
have been talked over, however, is the
return of the American troops to their
own territory, ensuring that movement

BRIDGE SPAN
FALLS WITH
FATAL CRASH
Train Into Quebec, Canada,
Brings Large Number of
Injured Workmen.
DEATH LIST UNKNOWN
Structure Across the St.
Lawrence River Is Great
est of Kind in World.
Quebec, Sept. 11. The span of
the world's greatest bridge col
lapsed and fell Into the St. Law
rence river today, with a loss of
life variously estimated.
The company erecting the struc
ture placed the number of deaths
at upwards of 25, but H. P. Borden,
a member of the Quebec bridge
commission, expressed the opin
ion that only three persons were
lost.
Several hours after the accident
happened at 10:30 o'clock, a spe
cial train into Quebec brought 20
men who had been injured.
Nine years ago a similar accident at
the same spot took a toll of 70 lives.
Today 90 men were carried into the
river when the 5,000 ton span, being
raised from pontoons in an engineer
ing feat designed to complete the
$17,000,000 cantilever suspension for
transcontinental railway traffic, plung
ed a distance of 15 feet into the water
and sank 200 feet, perhaps never to be
recovered.
Contradictory stories were told re
garding the collapse.
The pontoons had been removed and
the span was being lifted by massive
hydraulic Jacks when, according to
some of the spectators, the northern
end of the span fell with the breaking
girders. Frantic efforts were made to
place a chain rope around the totter
ing structure, but with reports like
shells exploding, the remaining sup
ports snapped and the span disap
peared with a tremendous splash.
Some observers said the structure
buckled at the center as it fell.
Groups of men at work slipped off
into the water and others were knocked
into space by flying debris. Scores of
craft containing spectators went to the
rescue and their endeavors prevented
a larger loss of life.
Cost of $17,000,000.
The bridge was being constructed at
a cost of $17,000,000 in order to shorten
the railway journey from Halifax to
the Canadian northwest by 200 miles.
The central span, which fell today,
weighs more than 5,000 tons and i3 640
feet long.
The collapse occurred when the span
was about 15 feet in the air. Early
indications were that the loss of life
would be heavy, for there were 90 men
on the structure when it fell.
The span had been constructed on
pontoons a few miles east of the bridge
site and was towed into position im
mediately under the gap left in the
anchor arms of the structure.
Chains with links 30 inches in diam
eter, together with girders, were then
attached to the span and 8,000 ton hy
draulic Jacks commenced the stupen
dous task of lifting the span into place.
This work could be accomplished
only a few feet an hour, and as the
distance from the river level to the
floor of the bridge is 150 feet, the engi
neers had not counted on completing
the operation until the end of this week
or later.
Thousands Witnessed Crash.
The bridge was tohave been ready
for train service next spring, marking
an important milestone In Canada's en
gineering railway history.
The juggling of 5.000 tons of 6teel
under unprecedented circumstances in
the dominion attracted to the scene
today several thousand spectators, in
cluding members of parliament and
newspaper men gathered on vessels
furnished by the Canadian government.
Members of the dominion cabinet
witnessed the collapse from the deck
of a government vessel, while Ameri
can tourists crowded hundreds of oth
er boats of all classes. Eminent Amer
ican authorities on bridge buildings
and members of the Australian parlia
ment returning home after visiting in
Europe, also were on the scene and
river traffic for oceangoing steamships
had been temporarily suspended.

pathetic Walkout,
New York, Sept. 11. With the lead
ers of 750,000 labor men of greater
New York and vicinity threatening a
sympathetic strike, traffic on the sub
way and elevated lines in Manhatton
and the Bronx impeded and the surface
systems in those two boroughs and
Westchester county virtually tied up,
the general strike situation assumed a
more serious aspect today.
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, declined
to discuss the probability of a general
strike, but union leaders asserted that
if necessary 50,000 union men could be
called out within six hours.
All members of trade unions
in New York. Yonkers, Mount
Vernon and New Rochelle found
themselves today active factors
in the dispute between tha Interbor
ough Rapid Transit company and its
employes. The various individual
labor organizations in these cities
served by the Interborough and its
subsidiaries companies received the
appeal drafted by the Central Labor
bodies last night, requesting a sympa
thetic strike of all organized wage
earners in their jurisdiction, "in sup
port of the contention of the street
railway men for the right to organize."
Since the response must be decided
by vote of members, several days must
elapse before its result will be felt.
Elevated and subway lines continued
running today without apparent inter
ruption. The strike on the surface
lines has spread rapidly. Union offi
cials assert 11,600 men were on strike.
Not a car wheel turned all day Sun
day in Yonkers. Mount Vernon and
New Rochelle, and every surface car
stopped running last night in Manhat
tan and the Bronx also. Arter these
two boroughs had received an extreme
ly limited service during the day.
It is expected that the public ser
vice commission which has been in
vestigating the strike will make a re
port some time today, placing respon
sibility for the situation and throwing
its official influence into the balance to
aid the side whose contention is up

Chicago, Sept. 11. Housewives of
Chicago were today urged to weigh
the bread they buy and to assist the
city department of weights and meas

The request came from William F
Cluett, in charge of this part of the
department's work, who announced
that he would have a corps of in
spectors scattered over Chicago today
to test the weights of loaves.
The announcement by a leading bak
ing concern Saturday that for several
days it had been cutting down the
weight of its five cent loaf of bread,
was responsible for Mr. Cluett's mes

Anirnsta, Me, Sept. 11. An un
usually heavy vote was being
polled in all of the counties of
Maine today, according to reports
received at headquarters of the
democratic and republican state
committees.
Frank J. Ham, chairman of the
republican committee, declared to
day that the plurality of his party
probably would exceed 15,000.
William K. Pattangall, manager
of the democratic campaign, ex
pressed the belief that the state
would go democratic by a narrow
margin.
Voters of Maine to the number of
140,000 or more went to the polls to
day to elect a governor, two United
States senators, four representatives
in congress, a state legislator and a
state auditor.
National issues have been brought
to the fore and party leaders brought
1 hundreds of speakers into the state.
Including former Justice Hughes, for
mer Vice President Fairbanks and
members of President Wilson's cab
inet to persuade the voters to line up
with or against the national execu
tive and the majority In congress.
Maine, however, is normally repub
lican, and the democratic leaders In
sisted that something more than a
scant republican victory would be re
quired to constitute repudiation of
the administration, while a democratic
plurality, however small, would be
accepted by them as an endorsement.
Fighting for Progressive Votes.
Fair weather prevailed and this was
expected to cause a big vote, equally
desired by both sides. A governor,
auditor, four congressmen, two United
States senators and a state legisla
ture will be chosen.
The state officers are now demo
cratic and that party has one United
States senator and one of the four
congressmen.
In 1914 the progressives cast 18,226
votes for governor. How their votes
would split today was a matter of dis
pute. Both sides claim they will re
ceive sufficient progressive support to
carry the election.
The polls opened at 6 o'clock and
must close not later than 5 p. m.
Many returns will be slow, as some
twenty towns and plantations are with
out telegraphic or telephonic commu
nication with the outside. However,
the result should be indicated before
midnight.
