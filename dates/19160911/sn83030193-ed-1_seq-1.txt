A thousand men nnd women saw

Many automobiles had gathered, as
usual, at the foot of the Concourse at
Ocean Parkway at 9 A. M. Tho mo
torists onjoyod the fresh, cool breeze
a they watched tho heuvy surf.
Picking their way nmong the cars
nnd the peoplo on foot, two youths
came ncrosn the avenue from their
homes beyond the Hotel Hhelburnn.
They wore bluo bathing suits. Ono
was ralr-hnlred and blue-eyed, stood

shorter, a little younger and with
every appearance of confidence.
About thr(v hundred feet off the
Hhore the younger of the two men whs
seen to throw bis nrms high In air
then sink out of view. The other swam
to his aid, dived and brought him up
In a few seconds. Men shouted on
rouroEemcnt and women screamed.
Tho younger man suddenly swung
both arms around tho neck of the
other und they both sank out of sight.
Jmnes Kustls, manager of tho Park
way Bath, heard the cries nnd ran
up the beach. In a few strokes he
reached th plaeo whore the strug
gling swimmers slowly camn to the
surface. Ho dragged tho older youth
free of the clutch that was drowning
hlro, and began to tow him toward
shore. The man was so panic strlck
n that he grabbed Eustls around the
neck, and the two sank together.
Mounted Policeman James Hougbey
rode his horse luto the surf In an
effort to help, but the sea ran so
high that the horse bucked and
seramhled back nshoro, Kustls tried
under water to break the clutch ot
tho man ho had In tow, but found
It impossible. He raised his knees
and with a mighty thrust got him
selr free. Then ho swain after tho
youth and tried to get him Hgaln by
tho hair, but the waves had swept
him far out of reach and I'.ustlH had
all be could do to get himself ashore.

A crowd of 800 tiiterhorough strik
ers, who had Just left a meeting at
Lyceum Hall, at ICIghty-alxth Street
and Third Avenue, this afternoon
stopped nnd wrecked a Thlnl Avenue
surface car at Klghty'-nlnth Street,
dragged the motorman and conductor
from their plnces and bore the two
men off on their shoulders to the
meeting hall,
Although th 'i our was well filled
with passongers the ntrlkers did not
hesitate to bombard It with stones
until all the windows at front nnd
back tho car wan of tho open type
had boen broken and the light fli.
tu res smashed,
At the first stone the passengers
scrambled from the car In a confusion
of fear, as the car was completely sur
rounded by the crowd of strikers.
Loud demands were made that the
conductor and motorman desert the
cur und their Jobs, but the two under
the protection of Policeman Kremcl
view, or the Until Beaoh Station, who
was detailed aboard as a safeguard,
cowered In the middle of the car.
The stonn throwing and the threats
of tho crowd so terrified the two em
ployees thut they woro for leaving
the car at once, but the policemen
refused to lot them go, demanding
that thoy take the car back to tha
barna nnd desert It there if they
wished.
But this did not suit the strikers.
Thoy at ones streamed into the ear
and promptly dragged tho conductor
and motorman over the dashboard
and boro them off.
Policeman Kremelvlww had the as
sistance of n brotl. jr policeman, hut
they were unable to cope with the
crowd, although they used their clubs
freely.
Heforn the crowd left the car thsy
had wrecked It. All the gluss and a
lanje part of the woodwork had been
smashed and tho electric control put
out of working order. So It was left
"Mend" at the crossing, and within
a few minutes all tho southltound
traffic of tho Third Avenue system
was tied up.
Telephone reports of rioting and
disorder wero sent to Polloo Head-
nuarters from all parts of the city
during the morning. They purported
to come "front employees of the Inter,
borough nnd from citizens who had
witnessed scenes of rowdyism.
In every instance pollen resrtves
were hurried to the places indicated
by tho telephone inrNsugtty. They had
their run In uln. Nol only did they
find no lighting in progress, hut no

lii an effort to hasten the execution of the plan of the street .car
union leaders to force a sympathetic strike Involving between 700,000

upon at a conference of the leaders this afternoon. It was decided to
call a meeting of all the national and international Presidents of the vari

Huch a meotlng Is ncco&sary In order to declare a bin sympathetic
strike as many of the strongest unions have contracts with the employers
In their trades which they do not caro to violate. The general union rule,
adopted to curb the activities of hot heads or schemers, Is that no local
union can call strike without tho permission of the national offlcerj of toe
organization.

to get to New York, but should send
their proxies or delegate power to

ably would be controlled by the
