IS SECOND DISASTER
Bridge Is Largest Cantilever
Suspension in World
Boats Rush to Spot.
Quebec, Que., Sept 11. The span
of the world's greatest bridge col
lapsed and fell into the St. Lawrence
river today with a loss variously esti
mated. The company erecting the
structure placed the number of deaths
at upwards oc 2o, but H. v. tsoraen, a
member of the Quebec bridge com
mission, expressed the opinion that
only three persons were lost Several
) hours after the accident happened at
. 10:30 a special train In Quebec
brought twenty men who had been In-
jured.
Nine years ago a similar accident
at the same spot took a toll of sev-
enty lives. Today ninety men were
carried into the river when the 5000-
ton span, being raised from pontoons
in an engineering feat, designed to
complete the 317.000,000 cantilever
suspeuslon for transcontinental rail
way traffic, plunged a distance of fif
teen feet into the water and sank
200 feet perhaps never to be recov
ered. Chief engineer In charge of con
struction, whose name is Porter,
James Anderson, a blacksmith, Alfred
Cadoret who is badly hurt, and Arthur
CaHoret, are among the survivors.
The bridge was being constructed
at a cost of $17,000,000 in order to
shorten tho railway journey from Hall
fax to the Canadian northwest by 200
miles.
The bridge stands on the site of
the structure which collapsed on Aug.
29, 1907, with a loss of seventy lives.
Tho central span which fell today
weishs more than 5,000 tons and is
G40 feet long.
The collapse occurred when the
span was about fifteen feet in the
air. Early indications were that the
loss of life would be heavy, for there
were ninety men on the structure
when it fell. Some of these have
been rescued.
Boats from among the hundreds of
craft on which spectators had gather
ed wero rushed to the spot where the
span disappeared. The fallen struct
ure sank 200 feet to the bottom of the
river and engineers who witnessed
the collapse expressed doubts as to
wnemer it wouici ever bo brought up
again.
Observers said that the span broke
in two places first one of the corners
appeared to give way, -this being fol
lowed almost immediately by a break
in the center.
The span had been constructed on
pontoons a few miles east of the
bridge site and was towed Into posi
tion Immediately under the gap left
in the anchor arrangements of the
structure.
Chains with links thirty inches in
diameter together with girders, were
then attached to the span, and 8,000
ton hydraulic jacks commenced the
stupendous task of lifting tho span In
to place.
This work could be 'accomplished
only a few feet an hour and, as the
distance from the river level to the
floor of the bridge is 150 feet, the en
gineers had not counted on complet
ing the operation until the end of this
week or later. The bridge was to
have been ready for train service next
spvlng, marking an Important mile
stone in Canada's engineering railway
history.
The juggling of 5,000 tons of steel
under unprecedented circumstances at
tracted several thousand spectators
including members of parliament and
newspaper men gathered on vessels
furnished by the Canadian govern
ment Members of the Dominion
vuu'i witnessed tue collapse irom
tho deck of a government vessel,
while American tourists crowded hun
dreds of other boats of all classes.
Eminent American authorities on
bridge building and members of the
Australian parliament, returning home
after visiting in Europe, also were at
tho scene and river traffic for ocean
going steamships had been tempor
arily suspended.
Tho project interrupted today orig
inated in 1835 when, at the request
of the Quebec city council, a New
lork engineer submitted plans and
estimates.' Courago and capital were
Jacking, however, and it was not until
18S2 that tho scheme again was giv
en serious consideration.
Later, Canadian engineers obtained
a charter and, after many years of
delay, the building wa3 begun, only to
terminate in the collapse of the un
finished structure in 1907.
Canada's federal railway depart
ment then decided t0 reconstruct It,
and placed the undertaking in the
hands of a commission, which includ
ed several noted American bridge
builders, among them Ralph Modjeskl
of Chicago and C. C. Schneider of New
York.

John Humphry Burke of California, which took place at fashionable St.
George's, Hanover square, scarcely a week having elapsed since the an
nouncement of the couple's engagement
for a channel span longer than that
of any existing today. Its contemplat

between anchor buttresses. Provision
'was made for two railroad tracks, two
street car tracks and two roads. It
was to have been used by eight rail
roads. Toronto, Ont, Sept. 11. The prop
erty loss resulting from the bridge
disaster will be approximately $G00,
000, it was stated here today by Geo.
E. Evans of the Lincoln Bridge com
pany. The accident will delay the
completion of the structure for ten
months, he said.

Samuel Gompers, president of the i IH
American Federation of Labor, de-
cllned to discuss the probability of a
general strike, but union leaders as- :
sorted that if necessary 50,000 union
men could be called out within six
Traction officials attribute the fal

and elevated roads to the unprece
dented Increase in traffic caused by
the stoppage of all the surface lines.
Union leaders claimed, however, that 'M
tho defection of heretofore loyal em- 'M
ployes of the roads was responsible. '
William B. Fitzgerald, general or- (
gonizer of the Amalgamated Associa- !
tion of Electric & Railway Employes
which is conducting the strike, in a

"effort" of local traction interests to
destroy the union "is the forerunner ' jH
of a movement by capital to crush IH

day," Fitzgerald said. "Organized
capital does not intend that such leg- ;

books. The struggle in this city is ' .
only a symptom of the purpose and IH
intention of organized capital." i
