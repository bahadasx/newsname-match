International News Service:
NEW YORK, Sept. 11. While
threats of a great sympathetic walk-,
out iti all trade unions, involving"
70,000 workers, hung over the city
today, the strike of traction em
ployes made itself felt in all i-iuar-ters.
For the first time the service
on the subway and elevated lines of
the Interboro.igh Ilapid Transit Co.
dropped bcb.w normal, while service
on the surface lines was practically
at a standstill during the early
hours.
The traction officials explained the
poorer service on the subway and
elevated was due to the unprece
dented demand caused by cessation
of surface transportation, but the
union leaders claimed that many of
the Interboruugh employes, hereto
fore royal to the company, had join
ed the union ranks.

While the traction struggle enter
ed its lifth day, representatives of
all the leading trade unions were
preparing for a strike te. Hugh

clared that a ireneral strike would
l e on before the end of the week.
I'res't Samuel (lumpers, of the fed-
ration, conferred with prominent J
labor leaders. They asserted that,
the plan of a general sympathetic
strike had Ciompers' approval, but
he declined to make any statement
until he had i;nno carefully into th
situation.
Indications were that unless some
means "f reaching- a settlement in
the traction strike were reached, it
would develop into one of ihe sreat
et labor cojitlicts that hasewr taken
plaee. The thr.-ats of the triction
hifs to destroy the Carmens' union
has all iabor n this city aroused.

To prevent this reat conihet it is
understood Mayor Mitchet and
Chairman Oscar Straus of the public

a plan to force fn th the traction J
employers and em loves to submit j
