Hughes' prestige as leader of the Re
publican party will be fixed by the results
of the Maine election tomorrow. A badly
split party Is awaiting apprehensively the
returns of that State. The Old Guard!
element is in open revolt. Barred prac
tically from any participation in the
campaign, It foresees crushing defeat in
Noveimber under the campaign methods
that have been followed to date.
In advance of the Maine cnvas there
was a stock-taking in Bos= today by
representatives of the old element, which
Hughes has barred from his councils.
They went over in detail the results of
the Hughes transcontinental tour, which
will end on Wednesday morning, when
the candidate gets back 131 New York.
There was unanimity jmong them on
these points: That for all practical pur
poses the campaign is a failure to date.
As regards most of the States It was
agreed that to visit them was a waste
of time. Minnesota, the Dakofhe, Ore

CE CREAM PRICE
LIKELY TO SOAR
)ealers Foresee Raise if Milk
Costs More.
An increase in the wholesale price of
:s cream and a relative advance by
staller is what Washington may ex
ect if the campaign launched by milk
roducerg to force up charges here mate
Lalizes. This is the opinion of the lead
1g dealers in ice cream and many of
em declare that the rise will take ef
ct practically with the advance in milk
rices.
Ice cream manufacturers say that al
iady they have been handlcavped in
taking profits owing to the ripe in the
rice of sugar and other materials. If
rise in the price of milk taken place,
Iey claim they will be unable to con
nue sales at present prices. Milk is
1s most important ingredient in the
tanufacture of Ice cream and even a
ight advance in the price of that com
lodity. claim the manufacturers, would
reatly affect the cost of production.
Ford E. Young. president of the Young
:e Cream Company, stated last night
iat he was of the opinion that the
rice of ice cream would advance with
ie rise In the price of milk. Not only,
e said, would the advance in price of
le cream affect the wholesale distribu
on but that the retail price would also
Lke a material jump.
He declined to state just how much
f an advance to expect, but said that
would be sufficient to justify retailers
i discontinuing the sale of Ice cream
>r less than ten cents a plate or glass.
I other words, the small dealers who
eretofore have charged five cents a
late, will be compelled to either increase
reir charge to ten cents or stop selling
le commodity.
"It Is a fact." said Mr. Young, "that
I the past ten years every material
rhich is used In the manufacture of ice

It was stated yesterday on good au

rectly with the State Department in

.ce to the minimum the purchase of
ar supplies in this country. was, it is
leged. transmitted to Washington by
ie American Charge d'Affaires in Lon

England's objection to the Phelan
nendment is said to have been based
ithe ground that it empowered the

the British nationals in this coun

legraph and cable dispatches. This, it
as asserted. was wholly unjustifiable
bile the United States was not at war
though England. because she is at war
permitted to do exactly the same thing
ith regard to Americans.
The message conveying the English
reat reached this country just after
