ANTI SMOKING RULE
IS MADE BY PARKS
Superintendent Park caused
a great surprise when he an
nounced this morning before
high school assembly that radi
cal changes were to be made In
athletics anil In the student
body officers. He stated that
no athlete or student body offi
cer would be allowed to main
tain his position If he smoked
or drank. He further stnted
Hint If on any trip un athlete
was found smoking the game In
which he engaged would be for
feited to the opposing team.
There Is much speculation ln
high school whether or not he
can enforce this law, but It Is
certain that the law can be
partly enforced for many of
the athletes have expressed
their approval of the act.

BEAVER SAFE AFTER
FIRE IN LOWER HOLD
This morning was taken u chiefly
in registrations at the high school.
Owing to the large number of stu
dents and the newness of the school
to many, there are no tentative Ag
ues on the registration, but a con-
Iservative estimate would lie between
two hundred seventy five and three
hundred. tf these a great many are
entering high school for the first
time, a goodly number being from
other high schools but the majority
being freshmen.
Principal Drill stated that school
would be in full sway by tomorrow
and the regular routine would be fol
lowed. He said that several new rul
ings would be in effect, one being
that the auditorium will be used as a
study room and another that a part
of every period ordinarily given to
recitation would be given to study. By
thi plan it Is hoped that a much
better system may be maintained.
