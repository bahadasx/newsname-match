Attack* on Bulgaria from both
the north and south are apparent
ly in preparation by the entente
armies in the Balkans.
A movement from the south de
veloped today in official news from
Paris that the British had taken
the offensive on the northeastern
Macedonian .front. They have
crossed the struma, about forty
eight miles northeast of Saloniki,
after strong artillery preparations,
P|and are attacking the villages of
Nevolyen and Karabjades.
At the beginning of the Macedo
nian operations last month, the Bul
garians pushed down rapidly from
the border and occupied positions
in Greek territory on the right
flank of the allied defensive lines
around Saloniki, pushing their ad
vance with little opposition.
The present British thrust, which,
may mean the beginning of an 1m
portant offensive, with the object of
placing Bulgaria between two fires,
Is directed along the main road to
Seres, the natural avenue of ad
vance for an army pushing from
the Bulgarian border.

SCORES WILSON' CHINA POLICY.
G. O. P. Chairman Says Jap Menace

Washington, Seipt. 11.—In an attack
on President Wilson's policy with re

"If the future develops that much

TO WIN MAINE
Republican Leaders Confi
dent of Victory in Tov
day's Election.
DEMOCRATS ADMIT
STATE IS IN DOUBT
Hughe* Backers Expect to Elect Gov­
ernor, One Senator and Three Con­
gressmen—Hale Drag on Ticket—
Eleotion to Be Barometer of What
Will Happen in November Election
—Local Issue Not to Be Considered.
Portland. Maine, Sept. 11.—Now that
the tumult and the shou'tlnR in the
campaign have died away, Maine, on
the day of casting her vote, seems de
termined to reassert her adherence to
republican principles.
This is not merely the belief of re
publicans and the expectation of om
partial observers, but it. is the admis
sion of democratic politicians them
selves.
Both republicans and democrats
realize the time has gone by to spread
rosy publicity tales, and they are will
ing to reveal the truth. The republi
cans expect a majority of from 5.000
to 10.000 on the governorship and are
tertain of one senatorship, that for
•the short term, and of three of the
four congressmen.
Hale Weight on Ticket.
The democrats believe they will re
tain the long-term senatorship and
perhaps win in one congressional dis
trict. A few of them, who admit they
Xam jCBS 'seAiasiu-ain auipnpp aq Xnui
will carry the state by from 3.000 to
6,000. One of them, and he is a leader,
puts the democratic plurality on the
governorship at 3,335—no more, no
less. He asserts a reputation as a
political mathematician.
If the republican majority on the
governorship should be higher than
10,000 the republican senatorship
short-term candidate, Frederick Hale,
undoubtedly will be swept Into office.
Attractive as Hale is personally, his
campaign managers admitted today
he had been the weight on tJ»e ticket.
They expect his name to cut a figure
in favor of the present senator, John
son, the democratic candidate running
against him. A conservative estimate
is that 5,000 voters will scratch Hale
In favor of Johnson, and. In a close
^hteLwill have "serious conse
quences for "mm.
Election to Be Barometer.
To the people of the country the
election will be Important, because it
will be a barometer, to some extent, to
indicate what will happen in Novem
ber.
It must be reiterated that local is
sues will not figure in the decision of
the voters. These have been swamped
by a campa,i?m devoted almost en
tirely to national questions. Every
voter In Maine knows that when he
casts his ballot on the governorship
he will be expressing his choice for the
presidency, tho the election in con
nection with the latter ofEice does not
take place here any more than it does
elsewhere until November.
Think on National Lines.
And everything the democrats and
republicans have done has Intensified
this conviction of the Maine voter.
The hundreds of processions, rallies
and meetings which have been held
have been significant because local
questions, such as the democratic ad
ministration of the state, have been
lost in the entanglements and disen
tanglements of the public mind with
reference to national occurrences.
Under the circumstances the aver
age Maine citizen is thinking on the
broad national lines. Moreover, he is
proud of the unique situation In which
he is placed, and is not chary of ex
pressing his belief that the Pine Tre*
State is the hub of the political uni
verse.
If the republican majority should be
less than 10,000 the republicans ad
mit they will have little to brag about,
and that they will not be able to base
their confidence of a Hughes' victory
in November on the result here.

Quf' jept. 11.—The new central
spa/ q. :he Quebeo bridge fell Into
th. b? bee river at noon today. Nine
ty Vvrkmen were on the bridge and II
is fe&rod many were killed. Persona
on shore observed numbers of work
men struggling In the water.
At noon the number of dead was
estimated at twentawflv«
At noon the St. Lawrence Bridge
Company estimated the number of dead
at twenty-flve, but this waa not »us^
ceptlble of confirmation, inasmuch as
the nature of the aocldent precluded a
careful chock on the missing.
II. P. Borden, a member of the Que
bee bridge commission, this afternoon
expressed the opinion that only a few
were lost. Several hours after the ac
cldont, a special train came into Que
bee and brought twenty men who had
been injured.
Chief engineer McMillan was among
the injured He was rescued by a tug.
Five bodies have been recovered
Boats from hundreds of craft on
which spectators gathered to watch
the span swung into plaoe rushed to
the spot where the workmen had dis
appeared after struggling In the wat
ers during the moments immediately
following the collapse of the structure.
The span sank 200 feet in the river.
The bridge was being constructed at
a cost of $17,000,000 in order to shorten
the railway journey from Halifax to
the (Canadian northwest by 200 miles.,,
It stands on the site of the ntnicture J/
which collapsed on Aug. 20, 1M7, with
a loss of seventy Uvea. The c«ntral
span which fell today weigh* nor*
than 6,000 tons, and is MO -feet-1
length.
Being Lifted in Plae*
The span had been constructed on
pontoons a. few miles east of the
bridge site and was towed Into post
tion immediately under the gap l#ft
In the structui4.,
This work oould be aceompU?h»fl
only a few feet an hour, and as tho
distance from the river lerel to the
llonr of the bridge Is 150 feot, the en
gineers had not counted upon complet
ing the operation until the end of this
week or later.
The bridge was to have been ready
for train service next spring, marking
an Important milestone in Canada's
engineering railway history.

Into place.
Brealts In Two Places.
Observers said that the span broke
In two places—first one of the corners
appeared to give wqay, this being fol
lowed almost immediately by a break
In the center.
The Juggling of 5,000 tons of steel
under unprecedented circumstances at
tracted many spectators, including
members of parliament and newspaper
men gathered on vessels furnished by
the •Canadian government. Members
of tho dominion cabinet witnessed tha
collapse from the deck of a govern
ment vessel, while American tourists
crowded hundreds of other boats.
Rmlnent American authorities on
bridge building and members of tha
Australian parliament, returning home
after visiting In iEurope, also were on
th*1 seen«.
The project Interrupted today origi
nated In 1953. when at the request of
the Quebec city council, a New York
engineer submitted plans and esti
mates. Courage and capital were lack
Ing, however, and It was not until
1882 that the scheme was again con
sidered.
Commission In Charge.
Later engineers ofbtained a charter
and afteir many years of deflay the
building was begun, only -to terminate
In the collapse of the structure in 1907.
Canada's federal railway department
then decided to reconstruct it and
placed the undertaking in the hands of
a commission, which included several
noted American bridge builders, among
them Ralph Modjeskl, of Chicago, and
C. C. Schneider, of New York.
The plans for the bridge provided
for a channel span longer than that of
any existing today anywhere. Its con
templated length from shore to shore
was 2,239 feet, with a distance of 1,800
feot between anchor butresses.
Provision was made for two rail
road tracks, two street car tracks and
two roads. It was to have been used
by eight railroads.
