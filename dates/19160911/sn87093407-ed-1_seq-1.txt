(HUMPHREY BRANDED AS UNFIT
Humphrey is unfit—unfit to be senator of this state, unfit to be
again intrusted with public affairs.
If he could be forgiven for every other act in his career of mis
representing the state and serving the bosses—if all the rest of his
miserable record could be forgotten—even then this one fraudu-
lent deception, which developed
today, would STAMP HIM AS
UNFIT.
Herewith are photographic
copies of documents proving this fraudulent de
ception. These so-called speeches by "Honora
ble 1 * Austin and "Honorable" Green, boosting
"Honorable'* Humphrey, are A FRAUD and A
DECEPTION. They were never delivered in Con
gress. Therein they are fraudulent. They were
sent out purporting to be speeches delivered by
these congressmen in the halls of congress. There
in they are a deception. They were printed, the
envelopes were addressed, and they were sent
thru the mails at the people's expense, and therein
they were graft upon the people.
These alleged speeches of these shyster con
gressmen were sneaked into the government print
ing office and were injected into the record,
printed at government expense under the frank
ing privilege. AND EVERY DOLLAR THESE
FAKE SPEECHES COST THE GOVERNMENT
WAS A DOLLAR OF GRAFT.
This is the year Nineteen Hundred and Sixteen.
Ten years ago it was not unusual (or congressmen
to practice such miserable deception as is here
revealed. Ten years ago Seattle didn't blink when
its congressman boldly voted for a mileage grab
which would have paid him more than a bill
thousand dollars as traveling expense for a trip he had never taken. But these ten years have been
years of political progress and enlightenment. Yet, here we find Humphrey no further progressed,
no further enlightened, than he was in Nineteen Hundred and Five, when he was placed in the
' 'mileage roll of dishonor" by a national magazine because he voted for a mileage grab bill.
"Humphrey Attuned to Western Washington" spouts his local organ today. That's an insult.
Western Washington is not attuned to fraud and deception.
Seattle, Nor Western Washington, Nor the State of Washington
Wants a Senator of Such Caliber. HUMPHREY IS UNFIT.

VOLUME 19
SEATTLE. WASH . MONDAY. SEPTEMBER 11. 1916
Two fake speeches, sloppy with praise of
Humphrey, which were printed at the
government's expense and distributed at the govern
ment's expense in a fraudulent attempt to deceive the
voters of this state.
The photographic reproduction above shows the
pages of the two fake sj>eeches, also a government en
velope which carried one of these "speeches" to a Seattle
i iti/.en.
These fakes purport to be speeches of "Honorable"
congressmen delivered in the house of representatives in
praise of llumphrev AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THEY WERE NEVER DELIVERED IN CONGRESS.
Instead, they were sneaked into the records under the
franking privilege.
The franking privilege. which congressmen and sen
ators enjoy, all right if it is honestly vised It gives them
the right to send matter pertaining to government affair*
thru the mails free that is. without carrying the stamps.
I'nprincipled congressmen and senators have abused this
privilege They ha\e heen known to send their private
matter thru the mails at government expense. That is
plain graft on the people Congressmen also have the
privilege of ha\ing what they designate as government
matter printed free of charge in the government printing
office.
Shyster congressmen have, of course, abused this
privilege time after time Hut these two fake speches
represent about the rawest and crudest misuse and

ahu-e of the franking privilege that has cvei been re
\caled in this -late.
Here a couple of Humphrey's friends in congress put
their names over two sloppy articles praising Hum
phrey, then had them printed at the government's ex
pense. then put in government envelopes at government
expense, then distributed thru the mail free under the
franking privilege.
There are more than .VTQ.OOO voters in tins state. It
\v<mld cost, to •-end these tilings to the voters as regular
letter*, nearly in postage alone. It is impossible to
determine how many thousands were sent into this state.
However, the distribution was broadcast. On the day
that Humphrey reached Spokane, that town was flooded
with these speeches, coining thru the mails to citizens.
In the old days this deception often pot by, it would
fool the voters, but repeated exposure of it by maga
zines ,m<l new spapers practically stopped its use. The
thinking citi/en who knows how the fake is worked and
who receives such a document as tine of these alleged
speeches, cannot help but resent the deception attempted
upon him.
In tin' year of I ( 'U>. only congressmen of tlie Hum
