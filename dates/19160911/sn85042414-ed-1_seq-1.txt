So Declares J. Frank Hanly,
Presidential Candidate,
in Address.

Party Arrives From Fargo
and Leaves for West
Shortly Afternoon.
Platforms and prlnotples of the re
publican and democratic parties alike
'/wer* attacked by J. Frank Hanly of
Indiana, prohibition candidate for the
presidency, Ira Landrlth, candidate
'•tor vice president, and other prom
llnent members of the prohibition
fparty in a series of addresses delivered
[from the steps of the Grand Forks
Y. M. C. A. building this morning:.
The party arrived In Grand Forks
at 11 o'clock from Fargo and the
jeaat on a special train over the Great
1
Northern railway, and left for the
'west shortly after noon.
A good sized crowd heard the ad
dresses at the T. M. C. A. building.
JR. B. Griffith presided and Introduced
the speakers.
Mr. Hanly opened his address by
.declaring that there was no real Issue
'between the republican and the dem
joorattc parties. "Mr. Hughes has re
aligned from the supreme bench and
wants Mr. Wilson's Job," he said,
1
"but as far as principles are con
oerned there Is no real Issue between
the parties. Never since the time of
John Adams and Thomas Jefferson
has there been such a complete ab
senoe of Issues.
"What Issues did Mr. Hughes pre
sent here? Not a single Issue of prin
ciple, merely the question as to
whether some minor clerk had or had
not been a veterinary surgeon.
"Are Issues a* trivial as this to be
the determining factors in the present
campaign Fortunately no. An
Issue profound and abiding has been
raised by the prohibition party. It Is
concerned with the essenoe of free
institutions, and is nothing less than
the abolition of the liquor traffic.
"Let former President Taft testify:
In an address before the Massachu
setts Bar association at Boston he de
clared that It would be a futile thing
to amend the national constitution for
the prohibition of the liquor traffic.
He declared that to «o so would be
morally and economically right, but
said that to do so would be futile
because the prohibition law could not
be enforced by the nation.
"This makes the Issue challenge the
right of the people. Mr- Taft's re
marks are a confession that republi
can government has failed. I for one
will not abide this confession nor be
lieve It. There is no power greater
than the lawfully expressed sover
eignty of the people.
"Do you know what it cost to es
tablish this right? Have we forgotten
those who died and shed their red
blood to establish it? All men must
come to our standard, for we alone
support this right in support of which
our forefathers wrote their indictment
of the king of England and ripped
half the world from the body of the
British empire, for which Washing
ton gave his life and service to his
country, and then refused tne crown.
"It has been said that 'where

Associated Press the position the dual
monarchy In the world war.
"Austro-Hungary is far from ly
ing down, as hoped by some" said the
minister. "It is true we would hall
peace with Joy but not the sort of
peace oar enemies would Impose. So
long as we have to defend ourselves
against those who want to take part
of our territory, we naturally are un
willing to discuss peace."
The minister then reviewed the
situation prior to Rumania's declara
tion of war and said:
"We offered Rumania no territorial
concessions at any time after having
discovered In the case of Italy that
the world waa likely to mistake our
reasonal attitude for weakness. Nor
ware we taken by surprise by Ru
mania. What fooled us was that
Rumania made up her mind so quick
ly, We knew In Juno, after the set
ting In ofithe latest Russian offensive
that Rome and Bratlano (the Ru
manian premier) had made a definite
bargain. We also knew that Ru
mania was not quite ready for war at
I the end of August.

Vienna, Sept. 7, (via Berlin to Lon

Stephen Burlan von Rajecz, discussed
yesterday with a correspondent of the
Washington walked erect.' Compare
him with the man who confesses that
we have reared a thing greater than
the flag of the nation.
"Swear Fairbanks, tne republican
candidate for the vice presidency, and
let him testify. He says 'the liquor
traffic is a commerce which strikes at
the very heart of all we hold dear,
which debauches our men and under
mines the very foundation on which
the home rests.'
"This is the testimony of Mr. Fair
banks and yet he refuses to sign a
remonstrance against the licensing of
saloons in the ward in which he re
sides.
"Mr. Hughes says he Is for 'Amer
ica 'first, and America effloient,' but
he does not say how he .will make
America efficient. I say we will make
American efficient by the prohibition
of the liquor traffic.
"Were you satisfied with the ad
ministration of President Taft? Tour
votes showed that you were not. Un

will have Penrose as chairman of th*
finance committee. Dupont chairman
of the military affah-B committee, and
William Alden Smith at the head of
the naval affairs committee, In the
senate, and in the house the situation
will be Just as bad.
"The machinery of legislation will
be in the hands of these men, and
they will force the unconditional sur

GUARDS HOME SOON,
IS BAKER'S WORD
Washington, Sept. 11.—Secretary of
War X. D. Baker told Senator James
H. Lewis of Illinois that he will or
der the national guard on the bordur
home soon. Beyond this Secretary
Baker would not commit himself. He
would not fix a time limit In which it
might be presumed the troops would

Secretary Baker told Senator Lewis
that It was the intention of the war
department to bring more troops
back from the border as soon as their
places can be filled by organizations
still In mobilization camps-
Senator Lewis understood from this
conversation with Secretary Baker
that the war department is determin
ed to carry out its policy of sending
the 20,000 remaining guard troops to
the border.
Whether the administration will be
able to withstand the pressure of the
demobilizing of these troops is to be
seen.
"For all that, our military authori
ties made all possible. preparations,
which did not consist, In holding the
mountain summits and passes along
the Rumanian border, but which
consisted In the establishment of the
line of defense now occupied by our
troops. Contrary to the general lm-

Rumanians
"Rumanian diplomats lied to me
constantly. Toward the last their as
surances "became too fervent and
their lying too obvious so I reached

"Russian pressure was getting more

"I will say that Bratlano played a

Then Bratlano thought he would play

NORTH DAKOTA'S
SWEDEN REFUSES
TO SUBMIT TO
BUDEMAM)
No Solution of Mail-seizure
Difficulties is in
Sight.
London, Sept. 11.—There has been
a further and rather sharp exchange
of notes between Great Britain and
Sweden in regard to the difficulties
brought about by the Entente Allied
blockade and Sweden's retaliatory
seizure of mail in transit between
England and Russia. No solution of
the problem is in sight. The British
foreign secretary. Viscount Grey, in
sists that as a condition to submit
ting the matter to arbitration Sweden
must promise not to interfere again
with English parcel post matter In
transit across Sweden. The Swedish
government apparently is determined
not to make such an engagement.
Until now the correspondence has
been conducted by the Swedish min
ister in London, Count Wrangel, but
Viscount Qrey's latest note says the
count's communication is not under
stood and that the British minister at
Stockholm is being directed to pre
sent the matter to the Swedish gov
ernment. Count Wrangel has now
gone to the continent, where he will
stay for several weeks.
Count Wrang«l's letter says Sweden
shares the hopes expressed by Vis
count Grey that the correspondence
may bring definite solution of the
questions at Issue, and that Sweden
"would warmly congratulate Itself on
the application of the fertile principle
of International arbitration."
The count says further he is glad
the British government appears to
recognise it aa an Impossibility for
the Swedish government "to renounce
In advance the right to take measures
which regrettable circumstances
might render necessary." The letter
concludes with the statement that
Sweden recognizes fully the binding
character of the postal agreement of
1904, but maintains the right to sus
pend the agreement under the condi
tions in question.
In reply Viscount Grey says the
meaning of this communication Is not
clear, and that he had instructed the
British minister at Stockholm to point
out to the Swedish government that
Great Britain "must, as a condition
precedent to any arrangement involv
ing recourse to arbitration, have as
surance that the Swedish government
will definitely cease to Interfere with
the transit of parcels to and from the
United Kingdom across Sweden."
BOMBARD FORTS.

The expectation that the Rou
manian army would drive through
Hungary and bring about a termina
tion of the war, an expectation har
bored by many people, is not likely
to be realized, according to Prof.
Louis G. Michael, who was employed
by the Russian government in Bess
arabia for six years, and who'gave up
his position only a few months ago.
That Is not the role Intended for
the Roumanians, he asserts in an ar
ticle In the New York Times. It is
to protect the right flank of the Rus
sian army in Its Invasion of Bulgaria.
Now that Roumania has entered the
entente the Russians are free to
march through her territory, and this
has opened up a straight road from'
Russia into Bulgaria along the shore
of the Black sea and right on to
Constantinople.
Russia has for a long time been
building railways to the Roumanian
frontier for Just such a contingency,
and Roumania was supplementing
these on her own side of the frontier.
Threre would be no difficulty In
throwing a great Russian army into
Bulgaria.' The Bulgarians owe their

Bridge Stands on Site of
Structure Which Fell in
1907.
Quebec, Qua., Sept. 11.—The new
central span of the Quebec bridge,
the largest cantilever suspension In
the world, collapisert and fell into the
St. Lawrence river while being hoist
ed into place today with a loss of life
variously estimated at from 15 to 30.
Ninety men were on the structure
when It fell. Boats were rushed to
the spot where the span disappeared
The structure sank 200 feet to the
bottom of the river. Engineers ex
pressed doubts as to whether it ever
could be raised.
The St. Lawrence Brige company
estimated the dead at twenty-five, but
said a roll call "will be necessary to
establish the exact number. The
bridge was being constructed at a
cost of $17,000,000 In order to shorten
the railway Journey from Halifax to
the Canadian northwest by 200 miles.
The bridge stahds on the site of the
structure which collapsed on Aug. 29,
1907, with 70 deaths.
The central span, which fell today,
weighs over 5,(WO tons and is 640
feet long. Observers say the span
broke In two places, one of the cor
ners. first appearing to give away, was
followed almost immediately by a
break in the center. The span had
been constructed* on pontoons a few
miles east of the bridge and towed
into position un.Aer the gap left in
the anchor arms of the structure.
Chains, with lir.ks thirty Inches in
diameter, together with girders, then,
were attached to the span and 8,000
ton hydraulic Jacks commenced to
lift the span Into place.
This work could be accomplished
only a few feet an hour. As the dis
tance from the river level to the floor
of the bridge is 150 feet, engineers
had not counted orr completing the
operation for several days. The
•bridge was.to be ready for train ser
vice next spring.
REBELS STILL ARE
BESIEGING TOWN
Salina Crus,-Mexico, Sept. 11.—(By
radio to San Dl^go, Cal.—Fifty rebels
that attacked a constitutionalist force
deliverance from the Turk to the ef
forts and sacrifices of the Russians,
and they will not fight against them
willingly, although they have been
dragged Into war against Russia's
allies by their Coburg king. They
will surrender on the slightest excuse,
the professor believes. If they do not
force their adbication of their king
and compel the ministry to flop over
to the side of the allies.
Once Bulgaria is disposed of Tur
key will be hemmed In on three sides
by Russians and Britons, while she
will be cut off from help in men and
materials from Germany.
The only danger to this plan is
that of a drive against Roumania by
the Teutons. Should It succeed, the
Russian lines of communication
would be ut, and the Russian army
In Bulgaria would be in desperate
plight.
It is to prevent this that the Rou
manian army is called in. It will oc
cupy only so much of Tmnslyvanla
as Is necessary to secure the holding
back of the Austrians. Then It will
stop and await the development of
the campaign In Bulgaria.

ARE DISCUSSED
American-Mexican Commis
sion Consider Various
Plans Today.
New London, Conn., Sept. 11.—A
detailed examination of the various
plans for a border parole, which has
been suggested, occupied the atten
tion of the American-Mexican Joint
commission, which resumed its efforts
to find a solution for the problems
along the international line today.
So far there has been nothing more
than general mention of the Mexican
request for the withdrawal of Persh
ing's forces.
Bliss to Confer.
Washington, Sept. 11.—Secretary
Baker yesterday granted the request
of the American-Mexican commission
to have Major General Tasker H.
Bliss, assistant chief of staff go to New
London, Conn., to give the commis
sioners information he has gathered
firsthand concerning the military
situation along the international
boundary.
General Bliss will leave whenever
notified he is wanted. The general is
regarded as one of the army's most
competent authorities on Mexican
questions. As assistant chief of staff
he has more to do with the admin
istration of military operations along
the border than any other officer, ex
cept Major General Funston and re
cently he completed a personal in
spection of all the border patrol
militia camps.
Pressure from political and busi
ness quarters is being brought to bear
upon Secretary Baker and admin
istration officials generally to with
draw national guards organizations
from the border. Members of Con
gress. business houses and friends and
relatives of guardsmen have deluged
the department the last few days with
requests for the release of the militia.
Secretary Baker already has indi
cated that as soon as the units now en
route to the border arrive other or
ganizations will- be withdrawn.
Guardsmen still in their state camss
all probably will be given a tour of
border field service before being
mustered out.
