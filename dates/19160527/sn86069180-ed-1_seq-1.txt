Democrats Pleased "With the
Result of the Convention
at Lexington.
Beckham and Haly Present In
tho Hole of Interested
Spectators.
Democratic Congressional Can
didates Are Sorry This Is
Presidential Year.
FRANK M'GRATH FOILS BULLITT
The Democratic State convention
held at Lexington Wednesday camo
oft bb scheduled, tho programme of
tho Stanley-James combination be
ing followed out to tho letter, and
it is believed that there were no
now factional quarrels started over
tho proceedings. Of course tho
Beckham-Haly crowd did not ap
prove of the action of the conven
tion in any way and would have pre
ferred a fight on tho programme
of the State leaders. It Is rumored
that Percy worked overtime the last
month in seeking to stir up strife
at tho convention and had hopeel
that tho dissatisfaction engendered
by tho passago of tho Hutchcraft bill
would servo in tho progress of his
plans. But without political pie at
his disposal Haly is not a very
formidable politician and only
serves to prove the contention oft
made in these columns that Beck
ham's aide was a much overrated
politician. In both tho afternoon
and evening proceedings there was
but a few, calls in that large as
semblage of Democrats for a speech
from the Junior Senator, and in the
lobby of the Phoenix Hotel between
the sessions of tho convention Beck
ham stood almost unnoticed, and as
a fitting climax Haly and Beckham
left the hotel to ride to jthe con
vention in a homely "flivver," en
tering the hall without a single one
of their former bodyguards to ac
company them or herald their en
try. Two prominent friends of tho
Haly-Beckham combination con
spicuous1 at tho convention were Dan
O'Sulllvan and Tommy Drewry.
There was very little interest in
tho proceedings of tho convention,
duo to the fact that everyone pres
ent know Just who was going to bo
nominated, and tho only real en
thusiasm in the convention was dur
ing the speech of Gov. Stanley,
which was a masterly address and
well calculated to stir his heare'rs.
It can not bo denied but that Gov.
Stanley created a good Impression
prior to and during the convention,
his course of action being consid
ered fair in every way, and credit
must be given him for continued
support of the candidacy of Gen.
Haldeman for National Committee
man, although he must have real
ized early in tho action that it was
an unpopular selection, but was
duty bound through his promise of
last year to carry out that pledge.
Haldeman was seated rfs a delegate
in the Fifth Congressional section
of the convention hall, and his first
appearance in tho convention was
whon he. placed Oscar Vest in nom
ination as Sergeant-at-Arms. Not a
solitary delegate applauded anylof
his utterances and in that delegate
body of nearly BOO men from Louis
ville, his homo town, he appeared
to bo a stranger. This was very
evident to the State leaders and
they realized that their selection as
National Committeeman will evoke
no enthusiasm from Kentucky or
even Louisville Democracy.
As expected, President Wilson
was given an endorsement by the
conyention, but tho delegates pres
ent realized that it would take more
than words to carry this State for
the Democratic nominee this fall,
and even with a united party it
will take some sterling work to
save some of tho Congressional
nominees. There is not a singlo
Democratic Kentucky Cbngresslonal
candidate who doesn't wish that
this wasn't a Presidential year, as
each and every one is stronger than
the President in his district. These
men and their friends are hoping
that Roosevelt Is given the nomina
tion by tho Republican party, as
thoy bellevo that he can be defeated
by Wilson, but as for Borne other
of tho present Republican aspirants,
they are in a doubtful mood as to
success. Wilson's leniency in deal
ing with England on the opening
of tho malls question and his policy
in Mexico had driven many Demo
crats vinto lukewarm support.
The Louisville delegation, led by
Mayor Buschemeyer, Col. James P.
Whalien and Frank McGrath, made
a splendid showing, while other
Democrats from Louisville now
prominent in State politics were
conspicuous in the convention,
among them being Mack Pythian,
Logan Rock and Charles Wright,
and it is said with good authority
that the first named will be chosen
as Warden of the Frankfort Peni
tentiary before July 1, as there is
a movement on foot to remove
Warden Wells. Mack is especially
popular with Louisville Democracy
and he was the recipient of many
congratulations.
Sneaklnt: of Louisville, the Fifth
district convention in the Phoenix,
Hotel was featured by an amusing
incident. On his selection as Chair
man Frank McGrath stated that he
prepared a lengthy speech, but as
there might be longthy business to
transact he would postpone his ad
dress. County Attorney Scott
Bullitt evidently doubted the Chair
man's statement, and as soon as he
wait given a chanee moved in a
flowery oratorical effort' that it be
the mom of th convention that
Mr. McGrath deliver or read tho
speech. Tho delegates carried this
with a whoop, but thp Chairman
met tho issue with a skillful coun
ter. After saying that ho had met
with an accident on tho Journey,
breaking his eye glasses, he was
unable to duplicate them at the five
and ten cent emporium nnd would
have Secretary McDonogh read the
speech, at the same time lyindljig
over a lengthy document. This was
passing the buck with 'a vengeance,
and while tho Secretary was trying
to get his bearings Col. Jim Whal
ien saved tho day by moving to
adjourn, his motion being adopted
with n roar of laughter, and Chair
man McGrath looked at Mr. Bullitt
and said "foiled again."
IRELAND.
The news of the week from Ire
land all comes through London, and
that which would Interest Irishmen
in Amorlca has been carefully elim
inated. In London official informa
tion was obtained Monday of the
reports that a sentence of ten years
In prison has been given in tho case
of Jeremiah C. Lynch, an American
citizen, charged with having partici
pated in the Irish rebellion. The
American embassy received this In
formation from the military authori
ties. Ambassador Pago also- re
ported that John J. Kllgallon, of
Long Island City, N. Y., whose
father asked tho State Department
to Intervene In his behalf, is In
terned in a camp at Stafford, Eng
land. Mr. Page said ho hoped soon
to secure Kilgallon's release.
According to the London Evening
Standard, influences are working
for a settlement of tho Irish ques
tion by granting home rule at tho
earliest possible moment, with clean
cut exclusion of Ulster from tho
operations of home rule. In the in
terim, tho newspaper says, the
Premier may propose a temporary
Government of Ireland by an ad
visory board consisting of Irishmen
belonging to both parties.
Promier Asqulth in the House of
Commons Wednesday announced
that the office of Viceroy of Ireland
has been abolished, according to tho
Dally Express. Lord Wlmborne,
whoso resignation as Lord Lieuten
ant has not yet been accepted, will
bo offered another post.
The Daily News says that tho
scheme for the solution of tho Irish
problem which has received the
largest support in the Cabinet is
for an agreement between Irish
leaders accepting the principle of
separate Parliaments for THster and
tho rest of Ireland after the war.
John McNeill, President of tho
Sinn Fein Volunteers, has been
found guilty by a court-martial of
complicity in tho Irish rebellion.
His sentence will bo promulgated
within a day or two. As bearing
on his attitude toward tho uprising
John Dillon in the notable speech
he delivered in tho House of Com
mons May .12 declared that but for
tho action of McNeill, "who broke
the back of the rebellion, the mili
tary would have been fighting, still."
John McNeill, besides being Presi
dent of tho Sinn Fein Volunteers,
was professor of law in tho National
University and was tho organizer
and Vlco President of tho Gaelic
League.
Thursday the grand jury returned
two true bills against Sir Roger
Casement, leader of tho Sinn Fein
revolt, and Daniel J. Bailey, the
former British soldier, who Is held
as his accomplice. His trial wa
set for June 26.
AMBASSADOR TO ENGLAND.
Hon. W. H. Page, recently re
turned to the United States to ad
vise with President.
INTENTION FOR JUNE.
Tho general Intention for" June
recommended by the Holy Father Is
devotion to tho Blessed Sacrament.
This devotion manifests itself in a
fuller realization of our Lord's real
presence in the sacrament of tho
altar. Who can reckon up tho bene
fits that will surely accrue to tho In
dividual, to the family and to civil
society if all of our Catholics be
come inflamed with love for tho
Blessed Sacrament? That is what
we are to pray for and to promote
by all tho means In our power.
Love for the Sacred Heart of Jesus
and fidelity to the practices of tho
Apostleshlp of Prayer lead Inev
itably to a great increase in our
devotion toward our Lord In the
sacrament of his love.

London Times Owner Claims to
Control Seventeen Ameri
can Dalles.
Many Others Ilavo Felt the In
sidious Yellow Weapon of
England.
Clear Cut Summing Up of Evcnt-
ualitcs on Tills Side of
Water.
CRIMES AGAINST UNITED STATES
Lord Northcliffe, multimillionaire
and owner of tho London Times,
In an Interview stated that he
controlled the policies of .seventeen
of tho great dally newspapers of
this nation. A large number oS
the remainder of the press of this
country have no doubt felt the in
sidious yellow weapon of England
and yielded to its porsuaslvo force.
But thero are yet those of tho
press of this land who are truo to
American institutions and patriot
ically aro too strongly entrenched
to yield to tho attack of British
gold ,agalnst their honor. The fol
lowing comparison is a fine example
of a clear-cut, unmlnclng summing
up of tho eventualities on this side
of the water to date:
The crimes committed against
tho United States by British agents
under the direction of the British
Government are far moro serious
than the sporadic lawlessness of a
few Ill-advised, hare-brained Ger
mans. Wo havo seen tho English
set flro to American houses for the
purpose of abstracting valuable
papers In the resulting contusion.
Great Britain has pilfered the mails
of American citizens; not even the
malls nor the telegraph aro safe
from tho prying of English hire
lings. Thoy have spread corruption
and bribery in order to further
their unlawful ends. Thoy have
slandered our guests. They havo
debauched our laws. They compel
American citizens to violate the
Sherman act; they blackmail
American bankers; they system
atically strangle our commerco;
they recruit their armies In the
United States in brazen defiance of
our statutes; thoy purchase Ameri
can citizens to sail upon British
vessels; they haul down tho Ameri
can flag on tho high seas; they
?eize non-combatants sailing under
the protection of the Star Spangled
Dannor. As a fitting climax of
their influences thoy sedulously
bow tho seed of treason In the
hearts of American Tories.
In view of such crimes, per
sistently nd systematically pur
sued, we blush to say, with tho
connivance of our Government,
German "plots" sink into insignifi
cance. In fact, it speaks for the
law-abiding character of tho Ger
mans that theso violations of Ameri
can laws are so few. Theso men
must listen to the constant abuse
of their country. Their eyes help
lessly behold cargoes of poisoned
shrapnel shipped across tho sea.
Thoy see American officials closing
both eyes to English, lawlessness
on American soil. They witness
open acts of war against tho Cen
tral powers on tho part of the
administration. The administration
Is in tho positron of a woman who,
having hopclesslly compromised
herself, makes nevertheless pre
tensions to virtue. Having vio
lated our own neutrality, how can
wo blamo theso men if they vio
late our neutrality also? We must
emphatlcallM disapprove of such
activities, but we can not refuse to
grant mitigating circumstances to
the little handful of German of
fenders whose indignation outruns
their discretion whilo habitual
British offenders, who have no such
excuse, are welcomed to our
bosoms.

PATRICK F. M'OARTHY.
Tho sudden death of Patrick F.
McCarthy, which occurred at his
home, 1272 South Folyd street,
Friday morning of last week, came
as a great shock to his many
friends and acquaintances. Al
though slightly ailing for some time
past his condition was not consid
ered serious until he was stricken
Tuesday evening, at the Western
Union office, where ho had been
Night Chief for many years. Mr.
McCarthy was born in County
Korry, Ireland, fifty-nlno years
ago, coming to this country with
his parents when, seven years old.
For over thirty years ho had been
a resident of Louisville, a loyal
Catholic, a true friend and devoted
husband, loved and 'respected by
all who knew him. Tho esteem Jn
which he was hold was most cer
tainly manifested by the largo num
ber who called to tender sympathy
to tho bercayed wlfo and family
and pray for the repose of his soul.
Ho was a member of tho Knights
of Coulmbus, and in him Louisville
Council has lost one of its most
loyal and ardent workers. By the
death of Patrick McCarthy the
Kentucky Irish American suffers
the loss of a true friend, a friend
who never grew weary of the work
of commending tho paper to the
Catholics of his acquaintance. Sur
viving him are his wife, Mrs. Mary
Devltt McCarthy; a son, Eugene A.
McCarthy, of Louisville, and a
daughter, Mrs. Dennis J. Ryan, of
Terro Haute; and also a brother,
Daniel McCarthy, of this city, and
two sisters residing in Ohio. The
funeral was held Monday morning
with solemn requiem high mass at
St. Philip wen's church, when Rev.
Father Ackermann delivered a
feeling discourse and paid high
tributo to tho life and worth of
his friend and parishioner.

he expressed his appreciation of the
good work of those who had gradu
ated from the school and now hold

In the city. After the business of
the alumnae had been transacted a
delightful musical programme was
rendered and refreshments served.
This school Is unsurpassed and its

INTERESTING
Account .of Indiana's Hundred
Years of Charity and Cor- .
rcctional Work.
Father Francis Gavisk President
, of National Conference of
Charities.
Catholics Should Take Active
Interest in Institutions of
This State.
A THOUGHT IN THIS MATTER
At tho recent , meeMng of the
National Conference of Charities and
Corrections in Indianapolis a book-
loton .ths study of publicVcharities
and",v''cbrrectIons,waH- 'dlstrlbute'd
among tho delegates. It was writ
ten by Amos W. Butler, Secretary
of tho Board of States Charities.
It Is a very interesting account of
the development of Indiana's efforts
In the field of public charity and
correctional endeavor during the ono
hundred years In particular that
mark its existence as a State. Tho
record of that Commonwealth in
this respect Is most enlightening,
for it is a well known fact that'
It has been la the forefront in its
public social undertakings.
A diagram at the beginning oi tno
booklet shows the progress which
has been made and tho various in
stitutions and boards created for the
work slnco its inauguration. In
1705 outdoor relief was begun; in
1799 the poor were rented out to
tho lowest bidder! Today Indiana's
administration of official outdoor
relief is pointed to as tho most ef
ficient and satisfactory in the coun
try. This Is duo to the laws passed
since 1895, when tho reform of the
relief system was begun. In that
year a total of $630,168.79 was
expended for outdoor relief as a
result of tho extravagant method or
handling that work. In 1896, after
tho passago of tho reform law re
quiring reports and other regula
tions, tho total for relief of this
form amounted to $355,255.59, and
It has continued at that low total
ever since, while the relief work
has increased in efficiency. New
Jorsey, North Dakota and Massa
chusetts have followed this Indiana
mothod of relief Four hospitals
tor the insane, asylums for tho
blind and deaf, institutions for
feeble-minded youth and feeble
minded women, for epileptics, a
general hospital for tho sick poor,
orphanages under State supervision
and Stato license are other devel
opments of the public charitable
work of the State. Tho cor
rectional system has experienced a
similar growth and progress, tho
latest addition being tho State penal
farm, opened in M15. The poor
asylums of Indiana, while In many
Instances deserving of improvement,
stand ahead of those of the major
ity of our States.
Tho Board of State Charities, to
which a great deal of this progress
Is due, was founded In 1889. and In
1895 was given the supervision of
Institutions. Its work Is widely
known over the country. It has
brought about uniform nonpartisan
administration in State charities,
uniform records and methods of ac
counting, has Introduced the merit
system, has improved in a marked
degree tho business methods of the
charities and has set increasingly
high standards in the care of in
mates. It has carried on continued
supervision of these places with
frequent inspection and has boon
noted for its prompt investigation
of charges. Its efforts among the
local charities have been no less
marked and beneficial in their re
sults. Everything that Indiana has done
has not been undeserving of criti
cism and censor. Its law of 1907,
providing for the sterilization of
confirmed criminals, idiots, rapists
and Imbeciles, certainly can not re
ceive commendation Bnt all in all
It furnishes a splendid story of
achievement. There Is one note of
regret to be remarked and that Is
that Catholics were not rnoie-in
evidence hi the framing and admln-
(
Istratlon of these laws and Institu
tions. Unconsciously no doubt they
aided or retarded these ideas, but
consciously they did but very little.
Indiana, it is well known, has
but a small Catholic population.
What Is to bo said In regard to the
apparent apathy of Catholics in.
these matters there can bo repeated
with greater emphasis in many
other States. Thero are Catholics,
too, few in number, who have done
excellent work In Indiana. Father
'.Francis H. gavisk, this year's Presl
jdent of tho National Conference of
Charities and Corrections and mem
ber of tho Board of State Charities,
Is a conspicuous example'. Such
examples should be greatly in
creased. Our Catholic people should
take a more vital, actlvo Interest in
tho Institutions of their State. When
In the legislative bodies thoy should
be found promoting desirable and
needed measures while over guided
by ethical considerations In their
conduct and their view. They should
seek to servo on local boards of
visitation to seo that the public in
stitutions are carried on in the
proper manner. They should per
form their duties as members of
tho citizenship. In this way will
they build up those things which
tho needs of their community re
quire. In this way will they defeat
the Inauguration of incorrect meth
ods and measures on the part of
tho Commonwealth. C. B. of C. V.

Ireland's Cause.
IRELAND'S GLORY A CERTAINTY
Rousing and enthusiastic was tho
reception accorded Rpv. Father J.
J, Fitzgerald, pastor of St. Leo's
church, Highland Park, at tho
meeting of Division 4, Ancient Or
der of Hibernians, Monday evening
In Bertrand Hall. Father Fitzgerald
is a big favorite among the mem-
Ders or tno order and especially
among tho membership comprising
the Limerick division, and wheIt
was announced last week that hoi
would bo their guest a full attend
ance was the' result. President
John H. Hennessy presided over the
meeting and after a short business
session Rev. Father J. T. Keelly,
chaplain of tho division, Introduced
the guets of honor as a friend, of
tiie oraor ana a close mend of tho,
Dominican fathers.
In his opening remarks Fathorj
Fitzgerald paid quite a tributo to
tho division and the closo relation
ship between tho members and tho
priests attached to St. Louis Ber
trand's church, stating that whor-
ever there was found a union of
tho order and friars, as in thj
olden days, It augured well for ai
Father Fitzgerald then dlscussoj
tho present situation In Ireland
and said above all that no credf
must be placed In tho stories com
ing through our dally press, as they
aro doctored by England, and Eng
land contaminates and controls
many of our lea'dlng organs. The
speaker deplored the revolution of
the Sinn Fein party as thoy wero
In a hopeless minority, but compli
mented them for their bravery and
tho cause for which they fought,
and although they were defeated
the cause for which they fought
wonldotrdlo. The fact ws also.
cited that the English Government
had consistently followed its brutal
course as In the past, shooting down
tho Sinn Fein leaders in cold blood,
tho executions being nothing short
of cold-blooded murder, as tho
trials were a farce In every senso
of tho word. Father Fitzgerald
also predicted that Ireland's glory
was to cofno and roused his audi
ence, to the highest pitch of en
thusiasm when ho said that it would
come despite treason, hell and
England. Ho also said that tho
course of John Redmond was not
to be admired and that tho latter
In his rolo of a recruiter for Eng
land was a traitor to his country.
Very Rev. Father Crowley, Prior
of St. Louis Bertrand's, was pres
ent, and in following Father Fitz
gerald satd that he believed that tho
courso laid down by Daniel O'Con
nell was tho proper method to pur
sue in securing home rule and self
government for Ireland. Tho
speaker further said that In justi
fication of this opinion it must bo
considered that Ireland could do
nothing by real force, being at tho
mercy of England, with Us power
ful navy, and that she must enlist
tho support of the wholo world in
forcing England to give her Justice
and that the great weapon of pub
lic sentiment must bo tho means
used by 'Ireland to achieve that
end. Following Father Crowley's
talk a smoker was hold and before
tho meeting adjourned a motion
duly seconded and carried waa
passpd by a rising vote to make
Father Fitzgerald a member of the"
order and enlisted as a member of
Division 4. Father Fitzgerald re
sponded, thanking the division for
this testimonial of their apprecia
tion of his visit and promised to
m tho division and order at all
times in any way . possible. The
reverend speaker's two stories of
"the man from Limerick" and
"wireless telegraph" in Ireland
brought down tho house.
Before closing the meeting Presi
dent Hennessy called on Dave
Reilly to give his famous rendition
of tho "Irish Jubilee," which as
always was much enjoyed, the
singer being without a peer, in that
selection. The officers and mem(
bers of Division 4 were very en-
thusiastlc over tho result of the
meeting. Tho largp auenuuntu,
outside of being a testimonial to
Father Fitzgerald, Bhowed that the
spirit of Hlbernlanlsm Is still
ramnant and beneficial results are
