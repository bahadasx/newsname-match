SPENCER BUSINESS COLLEG
Because men now travel 011 wings, talk by lightning,
annihilate both time and space, by means of t he telephone,
and require 100 per cent efficiency in their employes.
Because a thorough business education, with shorthand
and typewriting gives the great es guarantee of success.
You must make a LIVING whether you want tool not.
The right kind of a business education gives the surest
means of acquiring the former, and the easiest way to make
the latter.
Because itsfaculty greets its audience each morning with
interest so vital, purposes so useful, originality so varied,
ideas so new, fresh and bountiful, that each day's work is
a performance possible only to such co-operative forces.
Because the methods employed in both the Commercial
and Shorthand departments are simple, easy, fascinating,
and the time required to master them is about one-half the
time it takes to half-way master the old systems.
Because we conduct a Free Employment department
and have an experienced man to devote his time to that
work alone.
