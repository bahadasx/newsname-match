MR. FARMER: ' , r
I submit the above statement for your consideration before placing your insurance this year.
The Alminac predicts severe hail stprms in 1916. Are you prepared? In 1915 we paid more than
50 claims for losses. The smallest was for $100; the largest for $2800; and not one dissatisfied cus
tomer We have established a record for prompt payment of losses in 1915, why not place your
business with us this year? Don't let the other fellow talk ycu into insuring with an, Irresponsible
Company but see us NOW. .What is worth doing at all is worth doing quickly.
Our Patrons are Our Best Recommendation
" Yours for business, .
. J. M. SCHAEFER.
P. S. We will write your Hail business at cash, rates, without interest Our losses will be
adjusted again by our own meri, .ryiiientbslr! nxadaJn ths field on day of adjustment. Does this
sound riht to yon? . . ' -
Master then gave three taps with the
mallet on the corner stone. Deputy
Grand Master Johnson poured the corn,
Grand Senior Warden Brumitt the wine,
and Grand Junior Warden'Shively the
oil. Before presenting the emblems of
consecration came the statement of the
Grand Master. The proper Masonic in
vocation was then read and the public
grand honors given. -The three jewels,
the square, the level, and the plumb
were returned by the Grand Master
Lamb to Principal Architect Cochran.
The Grand Master then gave his official
address at the conclusion of which he
introduced the orator of the occasion,
former Governor E. W. Hoch of Kansas,
Governor Hoch was at his best. , De
spite the high wind and dust, Governor
Hoch said, that it was a test of oratory
to be able to attack the wind without
by the wind within. Governor Hoch al
luded to the fact that eight years ago
he himself had laid the corner stone of
the gymnasium which will soon be the
school library. The keynote of the
Governor's address was sounded when
he said that the significance of corner
stone laying was found in the patriot
ism of the present. The real signifi
cance of the corner stone was in the
purpose of the building which the cor
ner stone adorned. The governor used
The Power of Imagination as the theme
of his discourse. He said that Sheridan
Coliseum was first conceived in the
brain and soul of President LewL-i of the
State Normal School and that the archi
tect, the board, and the contractor had
to merely extend that dream. He went
on to say that the imagin?tion of the
people of Kansas would carry them past
the corner stone to the products of the
institution and that for one hundred
years products of this institution would
go past that corner stone out into ser
vice for the upbuilding of Western
Kansas. The imagination could see
this army in the years to come as it
blessed the entire state. That was the
real significance of the corner stone.
Governor Hoch pointed out that this
corner stone marked a transition from
old Western Kansas to new Western
Kansas, from the old Hays to the new
Hays. He said that although the board
was going to forever protect the relics
of the past on old Fort Hill, they could
do no more than represent the patriot
ism of the past. This corner stone to
day, the Governor said, represents the
patriotism of the present.
Governor Hoch said that three years
ago he had stood upon the platform of
the little auditorium of the administra
tion building and talked only to a small
percentage of the people that tried to
hear him, and his prophecy at that time
was that the state would build a build
ing in Western Kansas that could ac
commodate Western Kansas and he felt
it his high honor and privilege to partic
ipate in the laying of the corner stone
of that building.
The Governor told the assembled
crowd that Sheridan Coliseum was the
most unique and the most general use
ful building of any of the buildings in
the State of Kansas. Governor Hoch
closed his address by speaking of the
support by taxation of the people of
Kansas for the. state institutions, espe
cially those of education,
The immense crowd patiently braved
what was almost a dust storm and the
automobiles lined up in front of the
campus numbered about 140.

The United States Census Statistics
CONTAINS SOME INTERESTING FIGURES
These figures show that sixty-six, read it, (66) out
of 100 people dying in the United States have at
solutely no estate. They die penniless.
Of the remaining thirty-four (34) persons, twenty-five
die with less than $1300, and only nine (9)
persons in one hundred (100) have more than $5000
when they die.
The above figures are not estimates, idle guesses
or fiction, they are the facts, arrived at by the U.
S. Government in its Census reports.
The remedy is simple. Just save your monev.
