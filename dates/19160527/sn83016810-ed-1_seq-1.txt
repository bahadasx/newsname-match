.Peoples' Candidate for Railroad
and Warehouse Commissioner on the
Republican ticket at the primaries

Crookston, Minn., May 21, 1916.
Editor of THE APPEAL,
St. Paul, Minn.
Dear Sir:
I came to Crookston about twelve
years ago, and one of the -first men
I got acquainted with was Elias
Steenerson, who is a candidate for
Railroad and Warehouse Commis
sioner on the Republican ticket at the
primaries on June nineteenth.
I am a man of many years and
long experience, and for these twelve
years I have lived in Crookston, I
have worked for him off and on, and
have dealt with him in a business
way. He is an able and upright
man we have become fast friends.
He is a kind-hearted and accommo
dating man, a friend of the colored
people, whom I hope will show their
appreciation by giving him their
votes for the office he aspires, and
which I know he is well qualified
to fill.
Very truly yours,
i.w^m*

up to 54. The national committee

The stock fight over "restriction

Republican national convention. The
Southern States, led by Texas, are
reported to be preparing for a battle
to have their voting strength restored
to the basis in vogue in 1912.
Some of the western states are
making ready for an effort to have
the delegate strength of the south
pruned down still further.
