GOOD ROADS.
No belter testimony of the
quality of the roads could exist
than that which comes to ns of an
automobile trip, made last week
from New Orleans to this city and
on to Loreauvllle. The records
made by the odometer and chrono
meter tell their own wonderful
story, in forceful and eloquent
terms, convincing one that the
"flying'' must have been good.
What a wonderfnl testimonial
snob a trip is for the makers of
the car that made the trip!
Mr. Tli os. Gonsotilin, of Loreau
ville, had a very good oar, which
had been serving him well; but
lie had grown accustomed to itH
greatest «peed possibilities, and
demanded a little more. There
was a time iu the life history of
Mr. Gonsonlin when a humane
person would spend two hours of
life making a single journey from
his home town to this place,
rather than abuse a good horse on
a dusty road, under a torrid sun.
In those days the business man of
Loreauville would start, such a
journey early in the morning, at.
tend to his business here, possibly
have dinner and greet a friend or
two, and return home in the even
ing In time to superintend the
feeding of the woik animals and
• be penning of the calves A day
expended in a single trip to his
county-seal I The sauds in the
hour glass of Father Tune were
running too fast to tolerate such
waste of time in 1916
Last week Mr. Gonsoulin found
a party in St. Martin who thought
he would oe sato-fled with the
speed possibilties of his auto, and,
after the usual preliminaries, a
trade was oousumaied. To be
several miles away from a depot
on a through line of railroad, and
without an auto, waa enough to
make one restless, ueivous, and
sleepless; so, a trip was planned
impromptuly to New Orleans, to
select a car in every way désira
ble for his peculiar ueeds—one ca
pable of beating the best time of
a grocery delivery wagon, lie
experienced no great difficulty in
Unding just such a car as ho de
sired, and the deal was soon clos
ed. The car is an onnsnally large
one, with a capacity for seating
seven passengers It is equipped
with ail of the modern conveni
enoea and is a marvel of ingenuity
and the auto building skill. It Is
a Mitchell, of 48 horse power.
One day, the latter part of last
week, he started his trip for home,
at 10:30 a m., from Canal street,
New Orleans Hia route lay up
the Mississippi as far as Donald
sonville, thence across the river
and on to Thibodeaux and Morgan
City. Like a meteor he flew
through the villages and hamlets
of the Teche valley. Time was
almost hanlted in his flight and
distance was red need to an fncon
■tderable compass. At 0:45 that
afternoon he telegraphed, back to
New Orleans from New Iberia, to
the sellers of his oar, that the trip
had been a success; that be ex
pected to be at home in Lores u*
ville at 7 p. m In doe time be
rcoffved an acknowledgement of
his message with the suggestion
that be return the auto and try an
aeroplane for the further reduo
tion of distance and time.
The odometer registered a total
distanoe of 208 miles covered on
the trip from New Orleans to Lo
reauville, and the clock indicated
that it was made in 8$ hoars from
•tart to finish. The average dis
tance per hour waa nearly 24£
miles. Can your machine beat itf

THE GREAT ADVENTURE
Lake North iu Kvsryman.
Indeed, on earth with Kate we «hull
conspire,
Itecsnt the wolfish Scheme of Things
entire,
Hresk feudal codes (hat keep men
from the earth,
Remold the nations to the Heart's I>e
■ire.
That the Intelligent Minority
cease cross-firing, mass its strength
on a single issue, arouse the heart
of man to Immediate Action—
this is the Groat Adventure, the
greatest human adventure in tin*
world's histoiio time.
The Great Adventure demands
a free and open earth and is
more concerned to get it quickly
than to prescribe the exact meth
ods of achieving it.
Ho vast is the demand, of such
tremendous import to every soul
in Christendom, that the power to
achieve It is sought in the deeps
of human nature Home greater
force than self interest must be
reached. High wages, low rent,
good business—men will vole and
intrigue for these, but never unit
edly for they are disintegrating
forcer; lie, cheat, steal, waste
away their lives in endless bicker
mg. But for these they will not
be heroic, they will not dare and
suffer and forget and conquer; for
these they will not be unafraid.
The Hist demand is for a free
and open earth—open to whoever
will tire it, free to every soul on
equal terms. Men are born in
Christendom neither free nor equal,
but by the power of the awakened
heart all shall have an unrestnet
ed chance at the earth and its fu].
uchs! None shall hold or hoard
more than his need. There shall
be no title to the unused earth—
no monopoly holdings Greed
shall lose its foothold on the land.
The parent privilege shall be de
stroyed—and the superstition
I hat any man can Own air, sun
shiue, or earth! No one shall pay
another for the "privilege" of liv
ing on earth Rent shall go, aud
the landlord—there shall be no
"unearned increment." The land
is to be occupied and used, or left
as free bb atmosphere aud sun
light—the product of mines aud
forests to be fairly and dèceutly
distributed.
Do you want more than this!
We all do. We want the Insti
tution of comradeship. We want
to see man united industrially as
the bees and the ants are. We
want leisure and freedom to think
of other things than the ueed of
back and belly—a chance to lie
gin our human development We
want to explore the deeps of na
tuie, tear off her myriads of veils
that bide reality. We want to
dream, and live, and dare—be
men and women unafraid.
But all this, and all the heart's
desire, can only be begun on a
free earth.
Do yon want the factories and
workshops, the jobs, the tools, and
the industries!
These are fixtures and apparte
nances of the land. Ont of the
land they were originated, on land
they rest and cannot be removed
from it. Whoever bolds the laud
has full control over them. When
the whole people own the whole
earth they will have fall power to
administer its fixtures and pro
ducts as their wider vision aud
kinder instincts may then dictate.
To open the land is the first
great step toward the reconstrnc
tion of sooiety Until it is ac
complisbed no other step of real
advantage can be taken.
Something stirs now—we are
beginning to Feel as well as to
know—we are commencing to
Care, and those who care are
uniting to stop the horrors and
iniquities.
United, they will have their own
way.
If plutocracy can torn the world
to murder, democracy can turn it
lo fraternity—if a like power be
evoked. War awakens the de
structive passions, bat these are
only constractive forces turned in
side oat, aad much force is lost in
the taming. War evokes the Na
tural Religions Impulse—aud per
verts It.
If conning greed can incite the
millione to mortal enmity, intelli
gent sympathy can incite then to
friendship. Sympathy is the
stronger force, and has the baimo
nies of the universe behind it. If
hate can pit ehe nations to alangh
ter and destruction, love can»
weld them for life and growth. )
O, be ■ gambler bold and freely throw'
The dice of life, lay all its hollow
■how
Of droes upon the cloth—its Gold to
win—
And play the greatest game the heart
can know!
California has tnrned her prow
toward the rising suu. She has
declared her land shall be free!
