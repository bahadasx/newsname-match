PEACE LEAGUE TO EXTEND.
Speakers Urge Organization in Every

Washington, C.. May 27.—In
every state, county and city in the
United States branches *of the Leafrua
to Enforce Peace must organized:
to create public sentiment' favorable to
this covin try J5iningr a federation of
nations to miminize future wars,
speakers asserted today at the league's
meeting.
Strong public opinion W necessary
for success of" the plan, j". Mott Hal
lowell, Bosrton lawyer, explained, "first
because no national administration
would venture to bind the United
States to such a radical step unless
this ste.p were endorsed and under
scored by the people: second, because
if any administration should so pledge
the faith of our country and afterward
be called on to hake srood Its word
the ability to do so would doporid upon,
the strength of public opinion en
dorsing the league."
.Officers of the league planned to
solicit $300,000 with which to carry on
the campaign. At the proper time a
cqmmlttee of the league will seek to
Institute similar movements in other
countries.
President Wilson's address tonight

In this instance facts alone must
speak and one of the most Important
facts is that the neutrals are as eager
to bring about an early peace aa the

peace, and for this reason alone the
American government is under obliga

New York, May 27.—Arthur Warren
Waite today was found guilty of the
murder of his father-in-law, John E.
Peck, tho Grand Rapids millionaire,
"Guilty of murder In the first degree"
I was the verdict of the jury, returned
after it had beon absent from the court
room one hour and twenty-five minutes.
Waite was remanded to the Tombs
to wait imposition of the sentence on
June I.
Dr. Waite entered the court room to
day with apparently the same resigned
manner that has characterized hla de
meanor since the beginning of his trial,
The prosecution promptly began its
rebuttal of the testimony of the de
fense bearing upon Walte's alleged im
becility and Idiocy by placing on the
stand a neurologist, Dr! S. E. .lelliffe,
of New York. He testified that he had
determined from an examination of

signs of defective intelligence. He ap
peared to be an average man, the wit
ness said.
An Average Man.
"I believe he was an average man.
somewhat superficial, and snobbish,"
the physician said. "In my opinion no
was sane. I believe he knew the na
ture of the crime he committed. 'He had
sufficient mentality to realize the na
ture of his crime."
