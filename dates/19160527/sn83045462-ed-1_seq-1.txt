man, says Citizens Here snouia
Speak on Subject.
Washington is going to have
a monster preparedness parade.
Arrangements to this end were
perfected at a meeting of citizens
held in The Star building
Friday afternoon, and the formal
decision to carry forward the
big plans for a monster demonstration
for preparedness Wednesday,
June 14, Flag day, was
finally decided upon today at a
meeting of an executive committee
which has been formed.
President Wilson was approached
in regard to the undertaking
and expressed his apnrnval
ami thp rnmmittpp is
?" ? ? - |
more determined than ever to
make this a really national preparedness
demonstration.
Committee Is Selected.
. The business and professional men
gathered at the meeting selected William
F. Gude as chairman of the executive
committee, and also named the following
as the personnel of that committee:
Rudolph Kauffmann, treasurer;
Charles J. Columbus, secretary; R. P.
Andrews, E. C. Brandenburg, Melvin C.
Hazen, P. T. Moran, Edward F. Colladay
and C. Fred Cook.
The executive committee voted today
to proceed with the organization of committees
that will be jiecessary to carry
forward this work. The committee nas
established its headquarters in The Star
building.
"We believe that this is the logical
time for the citizens of the National
Capita] to speak in the matter of preparedness,''
Chairman William F. Gude
said today.
"Other large cities have held preparedness
parades, and certainly there
is no date more fitting than Flag day
for such a demonstration in Washington.
"We want the citizens of Washington
to realize that this is every man's
and every woman's responsibility. It
will be an opportunity for our people
to demonstrate their well known patriotism
in an outward manner, and
we trust that citizens generally will j
be prompt in organizing units to march
in the great parade.
Demonstration for Every One.
"This is a demonstration for every
one, and none need wait upon an invitation.
It is a community endeavor
that should make a wonderfully strong
appeal to all of our citizenship.
"The heads of organizations of every
class are urged to call special meet
ings at once and notify our committee
at its offices in The Star building of
the number thAt they will have to
parade and any distinctive character- \
istics that will surround their participation.
A place will be assigned in {
the line of march, and the time and
place appointed for assembling. 1
"We are particularly anxious that the
representative citizens of this com- munity
should take'an interest in the i
organization of these units and advise '
the committee at once. Melvin C. Ha- ,
zen will be the active marshal of the
parade." (
The executive committee is to take
steps immediately to have a joint resolution
introduced into Congress providing
for the stopping of the street
cars on Pennsylvania avenue during
the period of the parade. It is planned ,
to have Pennsylvania avenue roped
from the Peace Monument to the Treas- t
ury. i
The proposed preparedness parade ,
will dovetail into th* program for the
departmental Flag day and exercises *
to be held on the Monument grounds, *
at which an address will be delivered <
by President Wilson. Formative steps
to this end have already been taken.

LONDON, May 27.?A dispatch to the
Exchange Telegraph Company from
Peking says that Yuan Shi-Kai has announced
his intention to resign as
soon as a suitable successor has been
chosen. Reports from China received
here for some time past have indicated
that the president was willing to retire
as soon as the personal safety of

PEACE ON ITS WAY,
GERARD DECLARES
American Ambassador to Germany
Convinced War's
End is in Sight.
END OF U. S. TROUBLE
WITH BERLIN AN AID
President Wilson Now Has Greater
Freedom of Action to Handle
World Problems, He Says.
BERLIN, May 26, via London,
May 27.?United States Ambassador
James Gerard is convinced
that peace is in sight, according
to an interview published in .1
Munich newspaper today from its
Berlin correspondent. Mr. Gerard
is quoted as saying:
"Nothing can shake my confidence
that peace is on its Way."
The ambassador referred to the
settlement of the differences of the
United States and Germany as preparing
the way for President Wilson to
take up the question of peace.
"President Wilson." he said, "has
much greater freedom of action now
to deal with the immense world problem.
which will determine the future
attitude of nearly all the countries of
the globe.
Neutrals Desire Peace.
"It is useless to discuss at this mo-,
ment the question as to whether President
Wilson's intermediation is desirable
or probable. In this instance facts !
alone must speak, and one of the most I
imnortant facts is that the neutrals I
are probably as much interested in i
bringing about an early peace as the
belligerents. America urgently needs j
peace, and for this reason alone the
American government is under an obli- I
gation to its citizens to do and support
everything that serves the cause
of peace. A fact of chief importance is
that my government is really willing
to take action for the promotion of
peace. .
"I am very optimistic regarding the
progress already made of the idea that
the war should be ended, even among
belligerent nations. The wise and
moderate words of the German chancellor
regarding Germany's readiness
to make peace had probably their
strongest echo in America. and
strengthen the impression that Germany
will take all further steps calmly
and with confidence.
Future Steps Not Clear.
"When another step will be taken
and what shape the further development
of the peace idea will take is not
clear. At any rate, I am convinced
that my government will leave nothing
undone to support with all its power
peace movements from whatever side
they come. Even although weeks or
months may elapse before the thought
takes tangible form, nothing can shake
my confidence that peace is1 on its way."
Referring to the recent crisis in German-American
relations, the ambasssador
said:
"I hardly know from what quarter
the present good relations between the
United States and Germany could be
disturbed. The establishment of good
relations with Germany is one of the
most important factors of the diplomatic
situation now confronting the
United States."

uLLImU llnLI riULIUMlO
AGAIN TO BEGIN JUNE 15
President Not Expected Soon to
Make Any Change Affecting
TJ. S. Departments.
President Wilson and his cabinet j
have not taken up the question of extending
Saturday half holidays for a
longer period than now given by executive
order during the summer months,
ind it is stated to be practically certain
that the President will do nothing
on the subject for a long time to come.
Cabinet officers, in anticipation that the
President will not broaden his executive
order of last year, are preparing
to announce Saturday half-day closing
beginning June 15, as was done last
year, and ending September lo. secretary
Redfield already has signed an order,
It is said, announcing the beginning
of the Saturday hair-holiday period
June 15, and other cabinet officers
will follow suit.
Data Given to President.
Some weeks ago George L. Cain,
representing the League of Government
Employes, laid before the President
extensive data and arguments
favoring Saturday half holiday for all
the year, and showing that a majority
of the states and nearly all the big
cities of the country officially close at
noon Saturday all the year round. This
document has not been laid before the
cabinet by the President, but copies
of it were sent to cabinet officers by
Mr. Cain, who worked for six months
in gathering the facts. By something
like unanimous consent the executive
heads of the government departments
appear to have reached the conclusion
that no additional action is expected
from ""the President, who will permit
his past order for half holidays in the
summer months to stand.

OTHER SPEAKERS ARE LISTED
Addresses Before the Association
Pledged to Curtail War Express
Hope of Success Following
Conflict in Europe.
That zeal for the United States
to assume leadership in organizing
a league of nations to cttrtail
war must sweep over this country,
fostered by the unanimity
with which leaders in all avocations
and walks of life have indorsed
the program, was the
opinion expressed by prominent
speakers from all sections, addressing
the assemblage of the
League to Enforce Peace, at the
Belasco Theater, today.
In furtherance of this prospect that the
United States t^ill lead In this effort,
branches of the league are to be organized
in every state, county and city
throughout the country to create a sentiment
favorable to this nation s participation
in such a federation to minimize future
warfare and gradually bring about
world peace.
A fund of $300,000 to establish these
branches and to maintain headquarters
and an information bureau in the National
Capital and to support preliminary
efforts to institute branches abroad has
been started.
President to Speak Tonight.
This nation-wide enthusiasm is expected
to be aroused in a large measure by the
address tonight of President Wilson at the
banquet, which is to close the assemblage
of the league. Advisers of the President
have said that his address tonight will
be of unusual force and significance. The
President is known to have given much
thought to the convictions he will express
and to have prepared it carefully, knowing
the close scrutiny to which it will be
subjected, both in this country and in the
nations now at war.
Many delegates today expressed the
hope that the President's utterances
may be construed as an invitation to
warring powers to consider peace terms
immediately.
Strong indorsement of the league
proposals as given last night by Newj
ton D. Baker. Secretary of War, and
Samuel Gompers, president of the
I American Federation of Labor, is ex
pected to have great weight in arousing
sentiment in the states.
Appeals to the Public.
Strong public opinion is necessary for
success of the plan, J. Mott Hallowell,
Boston lawyer, explained, ' first, because
probably no national administration
would venture to bind the United
States to such a radical step unless
this step were indorsed and understood
by the people; second, because it any
administration should so pledge the
faith of our country and should afterward
be called upon to make good its
word, the ability to do so would depend
on the strength of the public opinion
indorsing the pledge."
Philip H. Gadsden, Charleston, S. C.t
business man. explained that the organization
of the League to Enforce
Peace, effected at Philadelphia a year
airo nrovided for creation of a branch
in each state, with a chairman, secretary,
treasurer, assistants and an executive
committee to direct the work.
For the institution of similar movements
in other countries a committee
of the league will l?e appointed at the
proper time. In the meanwhile Theodore
Marburg, former minister to Belgium,
is using his wide and friendly
acquaintance in Europe to get the feeling
of the people in other nations.
Mr. Marburg's Address.
| In his address today Mr. Marburg
I called attention to the necessity of the
United States having adequate army and
navy forces to contribute to the common
I police division of the proposed league
of nations.
Publicity plans were discussed by
Herbert S. Houston of New York, president
of the Associated Advertising
Clubs of the World, and finance plans
by Charles S. Ward of New York, secretary
of the International committee of
