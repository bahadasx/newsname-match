By Carl D. Groat.
(United Tress staff correspondent.)
Washington, May 27. An early and
satisfactory response to the American
mail seizure protest from Great Britain
and France is expected by officials
lierc. The state department Indicated
today that conversations with British
Ambassador Sir Cecil .Spring-Rice con
veyed the impression that his govern
ment intends to comply. On official
said:
"Great Britain's intentions appear
good, but its administrative system is
very much at fault and the seizures are
being conducted despite her pledge to
Tin ruin irom mem.
In the cases of Great Britain and
France, as outlined in the United States
note, the British fore or persuade neu
tral ships to enter their ports, search
their mails without regard to previous
protests tnnt detention of ships for mail
search is unwarranted, and employ oth
er practices in violation of the British
announcement of February 13 and the
mail section of The Hague conven
tion.
The United States is to enter claims
for damages incurred by such occur
rences in the pash Even American of
Tieial mails have been outraged, it is
charged. In conclusion the note says
this will be no longer tolerated, and
that no belligerent enn be judge and
Jury of its own violation of interna
tional law.
London, Mny 27. Foreign officials
today refused to comment on rable
summaries of the American mail seizure
note. The text of it, it was declared,
has not yet becu received.
Protest is Strong
Washington, May 7. A strong com
munication from the United States lo
Great Britain and France is in the cap
itals of those nations today, protest
ing against interference with American
mails ainl asserting that this govern
ment will no longer tolerate such j
practice.
The note was handed to the British
and French ambassadors last Wednes
day, the state department announced.
It characterizes the seizure of mails
as "onerous and vexatious." The en
tente governments' replies to Ameri
ca's first protest .re answered with
Jogal arguments, disputing their claims.
American commercial interests have
been affected, the rights of property
vinhted and international law has been
broken, according to the state depart
ment's communication.
It cites no time for discontinuance
of the seffcures, so cannot be classed as
an ultimatum.

OLD TREATY ABROGATED
BY PRESIDENT TAFT
In Exclusive Interview to
United Press Russian Of
ficial Tells Views
By WilUam Philip Simms.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Petrograd, May 27. Tht United
States faces tremendous difficulties in
any attempt to negotiate a new com
mercial treaty with Russia to replace
the ono aborgated during the Taft ad
ministration becauso of the Jewish
question. This was learned by the Uni
ted Press today on the highest author
ity.
Negotiations were betmn sir
months too Into." it was stated. "Tim
allies aro now perfecting a trado agrce
meet among themselves. Until it is
concluded, Russia will make no outsido
arrangements. France is hnuml in en.
counter difficulties, at least momcntar-
iy.
"If tho treaty is accomnlished nt nil.
it must confino itself to economics and
not enter into discussion of Rnsnin '
international affairs."
Count Kokokovtsoff, former premier
and former minister of finance, in an
exclusive interview granted the United
Press, made it plain that Russia would
consider no treaty in which its treat
ment of Jews was mado an issue.
"I am not an anti-Jew,!' he said.
"My record is proof of this."
"I admire America," said tho count.
"I welcome" American cooperation in
building industries and railroads and
in opening vast resources of raw ma
terial, of every sort. Before the war
Germany had made no special demands
on Russia. It was too keen. Having
ultorior motives, it scattered the wild
est stories against) Russia, making
trouble and meanwhile virtually monop
olizing trude.
"Americans ought to realize that
Russia cannot entertain outside sug
gestions regarding internal affairs.
Americans must come in like any oth
ers, leaving Russia to settle its in
terior proniems. '

Vienna Says France
Alone Halts Peace
Vienna, May 27. France nlone is
standing in the way of an early peace,
it was reliably reported todny. (Simi
lar advices have recently been cabled
by United Press correspondents in
Rome and Berlin.)
Great Britain is said to bo willing
to quit without attempting un offensive
on the western front. France, however,
strongly denires a final test, of mili
tary strength because her situation is
the most desperate of any of tho prin
cipal entente allies.
France fears Germany may not re
linquish the rich areas of northern
Franco which the kaiser 'b armies hold.
Also, the French have nothing with
which to bargain for peace.
