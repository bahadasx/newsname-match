GLASS PLANT
?
Means Work Here For Sev,

People.
RADICAL TlEIAlB
M
High Grade Line of Tum
blers and Stemware
to be Made
The Monongah Glass company have
acquired letters to tlie manufacturing
plant formerly owned and operated by
the National Glass company and will
at once take the ^ecossary steps to
place it in p&n^anent operation.
The pl&*\'b is located on Sixth street
and t&e Belt Line railway and was
9?quired by purchase from several of
the business men of this city who
had purchased it some few years ago.
The plant has been operated for
several short periods in the past sev
eral years by the Monongah Glass
company as an emergency plant.
The new owners feeling the necess
ity for additional productice capacity
to take caro of their rapidly growing
export business and having proved to
their satisfaction from pluvious oper
ations of the plant that In its prosent
physical condition it could not be
profitably oporated, opened negotia
tions for outright purchase.
Radical improvements to the plant
will be made at once. These improve
ments will include a complete auto
matic sprinkler equipment.
It is the intention to manufacture
at'i this plant a high-grade line of
blown tumblers and stemware for
"Which there is an unusual demand,
owing to the production in Belgium,
Germany, France and Austria being al.
most shut off on acount of the Eu
ropean war.
The usual vast importations from
these countries into the United States
are of course impossible while the
war lasts. Alos exportations from the
countries at war to all other coun.trio*
including all of South American, Cen
tral America,-West indies, Asia, Af
'ca, Australia and New Zealand are
Bhut off.
In addition England mnt leok to the
United States for its requirements in
glassware.
The four countries neutral it may
be interesting to know have supplied
the world with the exception of the
United States, with practically aU the
glassware used and in past have fo?id
it possible to place their wares in*ie
United States in vast quantities under
normal conditions.
As a result of the war those coun
tries who formerly depended upon Eu
rope for their requirements, could on
ly turn to the United States to supply
them and in consequence the manu
facturers are taxed to the utmost en
deavor to meet the situation.
This expansion in the manufactur
ing;, capacity of the Monongah Glass
company will necessitate the employ
ment of several hundred additional
people, the greater number of whom
must necessarily bo brought here from
other localities. This additional 1-n
dustrlal plant is not in the nature of
a mushbroom or experimental kind as
the management of the Monongah
Glasa company has proven In the past
twelve years their ability to make
good.

Captain Carskaddon
Active in Movement.
LIKE CITY
Regular Camp Grounds in
Preston is a Lonesome
Spot.
The Fairmont Chamber of Com
merce, cooperating with the city of
ficials and the Business Men's Assoc
iation here has Issued an invitation to
the West Virginia National Guard to
encamp at Fairmont this year.
Aldjutnnt-General John B. Bond has
been tho recipient of telegrams and
letters from Fairmonters requesting
that he will consider the matter and
that he will report favorably if pos
sible. AIn answer to these requests
is expected momentarily.
Caddell, the camping ground near
Kingwood has ben suggested as the
most likely place for pitching the
Guard tents but on account of the in
flux of letters to Captain 0. B. Cars
kaddon asking that something be done
to prevent the Guard being taken to
that place, it became necessary to
look for better quparters. The two
Fairmont companies are willing and
anxious to entertain the guard of tho
state and as to desirable grounds,
Fairmont has the territory surround
ing the Fair grounds as well as the
Fairmont Fair association property it
self.
All prominent business men of the
city interviewed by Captain Carskad
don yesterady and at no time did his
suggestion meet with disapproval.
The date for the guard to encamp
comes some time in July. Fairmont
is more than anxious that tho guard
be sent here and as the matter seems
to bo coming to a favorable conclu
sion although nothing definite has been
given out for publication) preparations
might as well be commenced.
The regular camping ground near
Kingwood is- along thg~Ch?1 liter
and from daylight to dark no sign of
life is seen during encampment except
in khaki. This, according to the mem
bers of the guard palls after a day or
two. Fairmont with it's large ex
panse of scenic territory is able to
furinsh the men all sorts of amuso
ments and to kep them in proper spir
it.
It isems that the camp at Parkers
burg last year has given the guards
men an idea of the difference between
camping in Caddell and near city.
They much prefer to be either in some !
city or along a car lino close to one.
Should the business men and cor
porations of Fairmont have any influ
ence with the adjutant general Fair
mont hay look forward to receiving the
boys in khaki some time next month.

illness.
The gentleman from Logan Is favor
ably known to many Fairmonters. He

ORTH CO. TO GRAND
HIPPODROME DARK
?Several Surprises Today in
the Tab Show
War.
One week ago today the famous
theatrical tangle which Interested and
amused Fairmont, caused the arrest
of A1 Coleman on a technical charge
and brought injunction from the Su
premo Court of the state started
and it was entirely in keeping
with the situation of the last week
that three surprises should be sprung
today.
Tho Lew Orth company, who are
the keenest sufforers in the tangle,
will play at the Grand Monday after
noon and evening, putting on "Alad
din From Broadway," in tho after
noon and "A Tango Tea" in the even
ing. Directly after the conclusion of
the famous Charlie Chaplin tango con
test, which was scheduled for last
night at the Hippodrome, will be put
on. Many entries have been receiv
ed for this contest and it will likely
be one of the most successful special
features ever attempted In this city.
Five dollars will be awarded to the
winning couple.
Manager McGovem of the Hoppo
drome stated this morning that the
theatre would be closed until further
notice, unless some action was taken
by the owners of the theatre, S. A.
| Moore, of Charleston, is the chief own
er of the Fairmont Amusement com
pany, from whom tho Clarksburg
Amusement company has been renting j
j the Hippodrome for sometime. Mr.
Mooro is expected here early next
| week to look the situation over, and
I may have some definite plans to an
nounce at that time. Unless a change
' is made between now and Monday,.
there will be no show at the Hippo-j
drome next week.
Further litigation in the theatrical
cE.se is very likely. While the in-1
Junction granted against the Orth com-1
pany automatically expires tonight, i
[ there may be further hearing of the j
case on a motion to dissolve the in-;
! Junction in order that, should tho j
court decide to finally dissolve the
injunction, there would be a chance
for a damage suit. Tt is understood
that the filarksburgh Amusement com
pany will In tho ne'ar future bring suit,
if possible, against the managers of
the Colonial.
Therefore tho public noed not be
surprised if the Colonial-Hippodrome
tilt may prove to have only really got
i started this week.

Booster Week Offer Expires
at 9 Oclock This Evening
To members of the 7,000 Club com
peting for the $3,200 In prizes and all
their friends who are Interested in
the result of the race we wish to em
phasize the fact that all subscriptions
should bo In tonight by nine o'clock
if you desire to get the largest pos
sible number of votes, and when you
are in a voting campaign it pay's to
get the largest possible number of
votes for each and evory subscrip
tion.
Nine o'clock tonight marks the close
of Booster week. By what you do this
week It will be known whether you
are a real Booster, and your chances
of winning will raise or fall accord
ing to tho number of reserve ballots
which you carry home with you to
day.
Remember that you will receive Just
30,000 votes extra with each threo
yearly subscriptions, either old or new,
which you turn in todaj*. Those liv
ing outside Fairmont who have sub
scriptions which they wish to turn in
have the privilege of mailing them by
nine o'clock. They will bo counted
UESer the Booster offer even if they
fail to reach the office before the
following Monday.
There is a wonderful list of prizes
to compete for, and it' will pay you to
put forth your best efforts. Thd writer
I is not making that statement merely
| for the benefit of the West Virginian
and the West Virginian circulation,!
but also because you whoever and
wherever you are can use and appreci
ate even the least of the long list of I
prizes. And in addition there is the 20 1
per cent, cash salary?an award which
will be paid to every candidate who
failB to win a prize.
If you win the Overland Six which
is offered as the first grand prize
you will have made the equivalent of
$150 of better per week, and you will |
have the pleasure of knowing that you I
accompanljshed it solely through your
own enthusiasm and energy in your
spare time. Others have won valua-|
ble prizes in previous campaigns con-1
ducted by the West Virginian but they !
never had the opporunity of- such
valauble awards as these.
For these greater rewards you face
no greater discouragements than their
rebuffs.
Let no false pride obBcure your
vision.
The ownership of a splendid car or
a high-grade piano will more than
make up for what ever temporary in
convenience you may have suffered.
You will have your concrete reward
."to have and to hold.".
And yet on the whole the task is
jleasant and easy, and you will enjoy
the work o fwinning almost as much
as the actual winning itself.

The same may be said of Fred J. Jen

Though new and dangerous develop

peared early this morning, the physic
ians insist that they will be able to
stem the tide which last evening seem

Fred Jenkins, though he shows no
signs of immediate recovery is con

for being able to linger on as ho has.

Profit.
The contest of the will of George
Wilson, a farmer who lived near
Metz, was heard before a jury in in
termediate court today. Several wit
nesses were examined in the attempt
to decide whether or not the will that
has been probated was or was not the
will of the deceased. The style of the
case is Eva Wilson and others
against Pinkey Wilson and others.
According to the will which was pro
bated Juno 4,1914, Eva Wilson, daugh
ter of the dead man was the execu
trix named and was also to receive all
of his personal property and his farm
of about 40 acres except that Martha
Wilson, wife of the deceased was to
have a life tenancy of the estate. The
controversy-'.was. first started in the
chancery court and an injunction was
granted the defendants restraining
Eva Wilson from the administration
of the estate. The defendants Pinkey
Wilson and several of the other heirs
allege that the will was signed by
Wilson under protest.
The paper itself was prepared by
the attending physician Dr. Q. W.
Kennay of Metz. He testified that he
had done thiB at the request of the
tne will'and thus save the expense o.
an .attorney. The controversy now
however has four attorneys mixed up
in it nearly a dozen witnesses who have
been summoned to testify. J. A. Mere
dith and M. L. Sturm represent the
plaintifln in the proceedings while
French" MCCray and Harry Shaw' ap
peared for the defendants. It is likely
that the case will not be decided until
early next week as ^t a late hour this
afternoon the taking of the evidence
tob.not completed. '
