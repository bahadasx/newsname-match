The best posted neutral observers,

the entente allies that the expulsion

effects of the blockade.
Should the results of such neutral
investigation of the number of men and
the amounts of munitions and provi- ;

brought informally to the attention of
opposing governments, and should this

It l(i MTKl' It .11 H IS DICTIO N
The United States reiterates that the
foreign governments do not obtain '
rightful jurisdiction over neutral ships
by forcing them to visit their ports for,
the purpose of seizing the mails ,and [
holds that such a practice amounts to j
an unwarranted limitation of the use j
of the seas by neutrals. It is sug-|
gested that "one illegal practice has
been abandoned to make place for the j
development of another more onerous'
and vexatious in character."
The note then sets forth a number j
of prei edents to sustain the position
of this country, going back first to I
tire war between the United States and j
?Mexico, when the. United States forces j
allowed British steamers lo enter and j
depart from the port of Vera Cruz with- |
out molesting the mails intended for j
inland points. During the American
Civil.War. Secretary Seward announced
that "public mails of any friendly or
neutral power, duly certified or au
thenticated as such, shall not be j
searched or opened, but be put as i
speedily as may be convenient on the i
way to their designated destination." j
In accordance with this announce
ment. Hie United States, in the case, of
the British steamship F'eterhoff. which
had been seized with her mails against
the protest of Her Majesty's govern
ment. had her mails forwarded to des
tination unopened.
"The arbitrary methods employed by
the British and French governments
have resulted most disastrously to
citizens of the. United States." It is
stated. "Important papers, which can

on behalf of the congregation, pre
s^ntei: hiin with a purse as a token of |
appreciation from his people.
Dr. Rosenau spoke to the coiifreca
tion of I he duties devolving upon tiie ;
rabbi, whom he characterized as the '
messenger of the Lord of Ho^ts as :
was tho prophet of old and the priest
who precedid the prophet. The rabbi,
lie said, is the betrothed of the con
gregation, a man who must be a leader
and make many personal sacrifices?
sacrifices of pleasure, strength and
health. Nothing, he said, that a con- ,
stifuency can do for its minister to f
honor him can ever be hoped to repay
him for all that he was obhucr! to do as ,
a worker in the vineyaid of the Lord.
In referring to Dr. dilisch. the!
speaker said:
It is hardly necessary for me to
state that I feel deeply honored io have
been invited to participate in this, your!
double celebration. While I am here
as the presiding officer of the Centra! '
Conference of American Rabbis. I am
also here as the personal friend of this

NKTT YORK. May 26.?AlteniW.s eworn
by the defense, in behalf of Dr. Arthur
Warren Watte, testified to-dav ?t his
trial for the murder of John E. Peck,
his father-in-law, that the young
| dentist was "a moral imbecile" and "an
immoral monster," who had only an
| insane knowledge of ri^ht and wrong.
The defense rested its case upon the
I testimony of mental experts The
tlienists of the prosecution will appear
to-morrow in rebuttal.
Walte's wife was in the courtroom
ajwitn this afternoon, and heard the
medical witnesses for her husband
;estify he had tolrl them he had mar
ried her only for her money. The
prisoner only appeared to doze while
a long hypothetical question, designed
to show that he was insane at the time
he killed his wife's parents, was read
to the alienists. The jurymen seemed
somewhat bored by the experts' testi
mony
L?r. Morris J. Karp.i? and Dr. Allan
Ko.-s Dlefendorf testified that Waite
was a moral imbecile, and declared
j they had arrived at their conclusion
i without consultation together. Both
I admitted Waite knew what he was
! doing when he was plotting the death
j of Mr Peek, but they declared he had
no moral sense. Both asserted they
j did not want the prisoner set free, and
1 1 ??? Dlefendorf said he should be kept
i in an insane asylum as long as he
lived.
MKI.IEVKS ( HIMI.VALS
MIOIL.D CONFESS CRIMES
Dr. Karpas declared that while moraJ
imbf rilt-s had no moral sense, they
tpp?Mi like rational men He said he
lielteved criminal* should confess their
! ??rimes, because the> owed it to society
j to do so.
"Do you think that the fact that a
| member of Wane's family was insane
an ay back in 1 s~ 0 had anything to do
"'tth the killing of Peck?" he was
asked.
"I don't know," was the reply. "I
j don't know 'vh.it kind of a lunatic she
j W as."
Dr Dlefendorf said that w hen he first
examined Waite. on Mav 13, at the
Tomb.-, be found the defendant com
post its a poem on "Love " Waite told
htm. lie testified. h>" loved poetry, but
kite** t|i?> names of no modern poets.
? tnd admitted thit the only books he
j had ???ii ih.>?.?-. tn an old dental library
he had bought for 145.
"Wife i.- one hollow, miserable shell,"
| the denti- i told him. Dr. Dlefendorf
1 asserted.
"What makes you unhappy?" the
doctor asked Waite
"I don't know," the defendant re
i pli'd.
1 'Have you had disappointments in
love -
"No. I don't believe 1 ever loved,"
Waite answered.
"Not even Mrs. Hirton""
"I fear that is only a temporary mat
ter Doctor. I don't want to be con
sidered insane. I know what I have
done, and r know l shall be punished
for it." the witness declared, Waite told
him.

TO HIS PRIVATE LIFE
Waite fold the alienist he "had a
worry," and said it referred to his prl
v.ne lift*. The defendant told Dr.
Dlefendorf he wouldn't go on the stand
to testif>, because Mrs. Morton would
be there, and he didn't want her to
lose confidence in him. and in the next
breath promised that he would testify.
"Waite said his degenerate habltu,
lie thought, had brought about a lack
of feeling in him." tiie witness testi
fied. "This and his weakness for women
were changing him. He added that he
had a "buzzing noise' in his head, and
said, finally, 'It's no use. I can't under
stand '
'He said he practiced medicine for
the sole, purpo.-.e of learning how to get
n ' of People," Dr. Dlefendorf de
clared. "He said he had read tha
l>ible. He told me that when Mrs.
Peck died he took out of her purse
on the dresser in her room."
Wane told the alienists, according to
the evident e, that he knew he ougt\t
to lo\c his parents, but "never had
very much."
Detailing a conversation with Waite
after his trial had begun, Dr. Dlefen
dorf said:
"Waite told me that he liked pretty
girl*. that he had tried to flirt with a
beautitul girl in the courtroom, but
that he could not catch her eye."
The alienist asserted that, as far as
he was able to determine, the defendant
had "no feeling of sorrow, no feellnff
of shame, no stren.-th of will." In his
opinion, the witness .said. Watte did
not know his act was wrong He said
he nvnde up his mind Waite was Insane ,
on his first examination of him.
At the close of Dr. Dlefendorf A ex
aminatlon. Walter R. Deuel, counsel fop
defense, announced that he re3ted, and
