AVIATION EXHIBITION
TO BE GIVEN FREE BY
BOOSTERS' COMMITTEE
Next Wednesday Aviator Moroney of
Montana Will Fly at the B.Y. College
Campus in Logan. General Public
of Cache Valley and Elsewhere Are
Invited to Attend at Expense of Club
On Decoration Day two years ago,
the Outdoor Sports commltteo of tho
Commercial Boosters Club promoted
automobllo races and an aviation ex
hibition at tho Fair Grounds. Tho
aviation exhibition was an absolute
failure and tho committee and every
Lody elpo connected therewith wero
criticised severely by tho public, as
many people had como 'for miles to
attend.
No ono was moro disappointed nnd
felt as if to tear tho aviator and
his macluno to pieces as the commit
tee, but that did not help matters,
only that a portion of that which,
was to go to tho aviation company
was held back. Tho commltteo
camo forth with a written public
statement that it would make good
with tho public by giving free at
traction with tho money that was
held back and If necessary add moro
to tho fund to give satisfaction,
Slnco that time tho committee has
been on tho alert to secure somo at
traction passing through at n reason
able cost. Tho commltteo Is now
prepared to announce .that thero will
be a freo aviation oxhlbltlon for tho
entire public at the B. Y. campus
EMILY STEVENS
AT THE LYRIC
MOfUND TUE.
Standlsh, an artist, uses Mary, his
wlfo, as tho model for his painting
of the Madonna. When tho Connots
scur and tho Pnrlshlonor come to in
spect tho picture tho Connolssuor
recognizes In tho model an old par
amour and tells tho luiBband so. The
husband, whllo surprised, fails to dlB
close his identity and tho visitors pur
chaso tho picture. After their de
parture mo arust upurauis pis wuu.
Sho tells him of her long acquain
tance with tho Connoisseur and how
for five years, sho bolioved herself
legally married to him. But tho hus
band, unforgiving, turns her and her
infant son out Into tho street.
Tho mother leaves her baby on tho
steps of a monastery with a crucifix
bearing her namo. Then sho enters a
squalid resort known as the, House
of Lost Souls, and becomes Us reign
ing queen.
Seventeen years lator tho boy Is
a novlco In tho monastery. Before
becoming a monk ho wants to boo tho
world. Father Anthony gives consent
and tho lad wanders Into the House
of Lost Souls, of which his mother Is
now tho proprietress. There tho nov.
Ico meots Lust, Rum, Passion, Avar
ice and Beauty. They try their wiles
in vain. Finally -ho succumbs to
Beauty. The proprietress enters
their ribald rovcls, takes tho lad to
lier room and finding tho euclflx,
learns that ho Is her son. Without
disclosing hor identity, sho telU him
to go back. When ho Is gone, sho
renounces her companions. Then slie
falls fainting.
Eight years lator tho boy Is a par
ish priest. In a fearful storm an old
hag enters the church. It Is the mo
ther. Sho sees above the altar the
painting of tho Madonna for which
she posed and recognizes her son by
tho crucifix he still wears. Tho son
gives tho mother absolution, as tho
Angol of Death enters and bearB off
her spirit. '
