The dry farmer in a semiarid
region has certain clearly mark
ed and unquestioned advantages
over those who farm either un
der abundance of natural preci
pitation or irrigation. Perhaps
the most important advantage
which the dry farmer has in our
western country, at least over
the rainfall farmer further east,
and the irrigation farmer in the
same region, is in the smaller
investment necessary to provide
himself with the land needed for
the support of a family. In Ariz
ona he can still acquire these
lands under the homestead law
at a cost per acre relatively low.
Folks down at Nogales are
"all het up" over the coming
city election, which takes place
next Monday. Judging from
newspaper comments the Line
City's election will be a hotly
contested affair, and some of the
natives of that thriving little
burg seem to think it is the
greatest event of the season. It
is only a preliminary, however.
The big show will start a short
time after the Nogales city elec
tion. Already the politickin-
ers" are throwing their heads up
into the air like an old war horse
who sniffs the scent of afar, in
anticipation of the county, state
and national elections. On the
eve of the approaching campaign
one hears the names of nearly
every citizen in county mention
ed for some office. Most of those
mentioned will not run, but from
present indications it seems
there will be a tolerably fair
candidate crop in this county
this fall. Patagonian.
With "baby beef" selling in

the value of high-class sires be

the scrub bull is almost a thing

point where the cheapest bull is
the most expensive in the long
run and the time will come when
no stockman who is paying any
attention to the business will
think of paying less than 250.00
or 500.00 for his sires, and
even at that price they will pay
for themselves in one year. Very
soon a two year old steer will be
a curiosity on the range we
shall have nothing but cows,
and cows at the present time
and in the future are going to
be highly respected citizens and
will undoubtedly be kept in ser
vice until they reach a ripe old
age and then be pensioned in
stead of going to the market as
"canners." It is not in the pro
vince of a market paper to pro
phesy, but those of our readers
who follow the livestock busi
ness can form their own conclusions.
COPPER IS HIGH ENOUGH.
Copper is high enough for the
good of the state of Arizona.
Producers are making extreme
profits, and even the highest
cost producers are operating
their properties successfully at
present. The state bureau of
mines believes that the produc
ers would be pleased if the price
should not advance further, for
the greater the price beyond
its now abnormal price makes
the market far more unstable
and when the decline comes.
which is inevitable, it would be
greater with the high price.
It is noted from the annual re
ports of the various large com
panies that they have not in
creased their dividends, although
the profits have greatly increas
ed, the extra profits being re
tained as a surplus to guard
against the future. With a large
surplus in the treasuries of all
of the mines of the state of Ari
zona, the stability of the industry
is assured, the working men are
protected as to steady employ
ment and the reaction when it
does come, will not be felt badly
by either the operators or their
employes. The far sightedness
of the operators of Arizona in
accumulating a large reserve
means steady wages for the
miner. Citizen.
