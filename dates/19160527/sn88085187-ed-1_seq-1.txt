Seattleite Pays

Gets $450
Discovery of a suspicions
sale of old iron and junk by
former Controller Meads, by
which a Seattle man made
JM 13.2:1 profit on an invest
ment of 930.70, caused Con
troller Fred Shoemaker to
begin an investigation today
wiili h may have sensational
ramifications.
The controller Is attempting to
fix the blame for the iffair, with
a possible idea of forcing city of
ficials, or former officials, to
make an accounting.
On March 28 the water depart
ment notified Controller Meads
that it had for sale a quantity of
scrap iron, and other articles,
which it wished to dispose of.
According to law, tlie controller
must make all sales, and If the
property to be sold Is valued at
$."iii or more, he must advertise
the sale and conduct It on the
competitive basis.
The water departmnet told
Meads by letter that E. J. Heller
or Seattle had offered $36.76 ror
the lot.^
Just Like Wall St.
The assortment to be sold In
cluded 0,320 pounds of Iron
bands, used on wooden pipe, but
considered valuable as scrap;
a,400 pounds of scrap iron, 7
pieces of water pipe, one bunch
of old shovels, and 15 light hoods.
The scrap iron amounted to more
than two and one-half tons.
Meads promptly sold (he
lot to Heller, on (he same
day, and accepted (he .yw.Tii
for the goods.
The Seal tie man went at
once to the second blind store
of Snssinaii Brothers, 1.1:16
Commerce street, and sold
his newly acquired hatch of
junk and iron for $130.
The sale was cash -md was
made on the same day that Heller
bought the same articles from the
city lor $36.76.
Gels $120 For Less.
Controller Shoemaker discov
ered the deal today when, after
selling a smaller quantity of scrap
Iron at public auction and receiv
ing $420 in cash for It, he was
approached by Frank Stissman,
who had purchased the former
assortment from Heller.
Snssman gave Shoemaker the
"inside information" of the form
er deal, and showed records ro
prove that the city had sold its
scrap iron at one-four-hundredtn
of Its value as junk.
W T. A. Kunigk. assistant water
superintendent, whose name Wis
aflxed to the letter to former
Controller Meads, today disclaim
ed al] responsibility.
"I was informed by Supt. Say-
Idae that Heller had made the
offer, and was ordered to write
the letter," add Ktinlak, "I
merely followed orders. I knew
nothing about the value of the
iron. The deal certainly does
look odd."

MOTHER FORBIDDEN TO
KISS HER SON IN COURT
WAUKEEOAN, 111., May 27.—
At the trial today of Will Orpet,
accused of the murder of his for
mer sweetheart, Marion Lambert,
the court granted partly a motion
by the state to prevent demonstra
tion of affection by Mrs. Orpet
towards her son.
The state charged that Mrs.
Orpet dally entered the court
room and in view of prospective
jurors went to the table where
tho defendant was sitting and
kissed him.
Judge Donnelly ruled that Mrs.
Orpet might sit by her boy, but
must be less demonstrative.
A diversion from the routine of
jury selection was afforded spec
tators by the summoning to court
of L. R. Merwln, a dismissed
DIANA WAS
A GODDESS
Tho ancient Romans worshipped Diana as the god
dess of the moon. She was thought to preside over
the woods and lakes, and to lead in the hunt and war.
Dianna Wynne, in a mine modern day, claimed no
divinity. But, like Dianna of old, she was a lover of
the great outdoors.
And when Cranston found her, he'd have sworn
she was none other than the goddess. You couldn't
blame Cranston, if you take the word of Harold Mc-
Grath, who wrote "Pidgin Tshmd," in which Diana
is the heroine. The novel begins next Monday in

.Mcrwin had been dismissed on

repeatedly declared he had never
expressed an opinion as to the

ant.
Orpet's counsel, however, re
