"THE QUESTION."
Patrons of Gem to See "England's
Loveliest Leading Woman."
Marguerite Leslie, known as Lon
don's loveliest leading lady, makes
her film debut in the Equitable pro
duction of Roy L. McCardell's absorb
ing story, "The Question," which
comes to the Gem tomorrow night.
"The Question" is in five acts, replete
with striking scenes and situations,
and presents in a vividly realistic way
the follies and foibles of so-called
"society" and the evil results which
follow them. The play itself, without
the added attractiveness of Mi s Les
lie's personality, would be a p:otent
entertainment, but with the beaut. :.i
star in a role that fits her like a glove,
the story in its visualized form takes
on unusual charm and conveys a pow
erful lesson. A synopsis of the plot
follows:
Ralph Tudor, rich and loving chil
dren, marries Grace Hamilton, a
spoiled society girl, who determines
to avoid maternity and keep up her
social gayeties. Anna Lee, who works
for Tudor, is blackmailed by her
worthless fathe:. Frank Gray, an
artist, is in love with Anna, but she
thinks she is in love with Tudor. Tu
dor's partner, Hyatt, is ousted from
the firm because he insulted her.
Tudor finds that his wife has been
avoiding maternity, and she admits
she does not intend to have any chil
dren. Tudor takes to drink and his
wife gives a dog party.
Alone with Anna, Tudor explains
matters, and they go on an illicit
honeymoon. Gray finds them, and
.Anna leaves Tudor, who goes to Al
-fidential iclerk, to take money from
the safe and place it to her credit,
Ryan is assaulted by Anna's father,;
and is struck by Grace Tudor's auto-'
mobile, The cash is found on him.
Hyatt claims it was stolen from the
firm, and that he has an interest in it.
Ryan is taken to a hospital, and Lee,
in an attempt to kill Hyatt, is him
self killed by a fall down a staircase.
In Alaska, Tudor's mail tells him
of the Ryan affair, and a letter from
Grace causes him to return at once.
Anna dies, and her landlady adver
tises her child for adoption. Grace
gets it and a letter Anna left stating
that Tudor is the child's father. Tu
dor comes home, and Grace, a chang
ed woman and repentant, permits Tu
dor to learn to whom- the child be
longs. She begs forgiveness, which
Tudor grants as she explains, "It is
our baby,"

A Toast to Laughter.
Here's to laughter, the sunshine of
the soul, the happiness of the heart,
the leaven of youth, the privilege of
purity, the echo of innocence, the
treasure of the humble, the wealth of
the poor, the head of the cup of pleas
are; it dispels dejection, banishes
blues and mangles melancholy; for
it's the foe of woe, the destroyer of
depression, the enemy of grief; it is
what makes kings envy peasants,
pluitocrats envy the poor, the guilty
envy the innocent; it's the sheen on
the silver of smiles, the ripple on the
Water's of delight;the glint of the gold
of gladness; without it humor would
be dumb, wit would wither, dimples
would disappear and smiles would
shrivel, for it's a glow of a clean con
Science, the voice of a pure soul, the
birth of mirth, the swan-song of sad
ness.---Anderson (S.C.) Intelligencer.

N. B. -The above statement incorporates
he various funds and overdrafts which are

statement appear not in its true light to
some of our readers,, and which I do not ap
prove of, inasmuch as these balances and
overdrafts have been removed from the cur
rent cash book and placed in suspense ac
counts on the city's ledger. I therefore call

PYTMIAN BANQUET AT MONROE.
President Wilson and the Ladies Com
plimented.
The Monroe News-Star of May 16
gives the following account of a very
delightful- social function connected
with the recent annual meeting in
that city of the Louisiana Grand
Lodge, Knights of Pythias:
, "Following . the exemplification
work in the lodge room last night the
grand lodge delegates and Pythian
Sisters were the guests of the local
Pythians at an elaborate banquet i
served at ,the Elks' Club under the i
auspices of the ladies of Grace Epis
copal church. The Elks' banquet i
hall was filled almost to its capacity,
few seats around the festive board
remaining vacant. R. W. Germany
of Stonewall Lodge acted as toast
master and filled the place most ac
ceptably. His first presentation was
L. E. Bentley of New Orleans, who
was asked to respond to the toast
'Our President.' Mr. Bentley, who
is one of the best and most humor
ous speakers- in the grand lodge,
s'poke seriously on the subject, pay
ing a tribute. to the president for
kee~ing the country out of the big
war in Europe and the little war in
Mexico, at the same time maintain
ing our national dignity. He ex
pressed the hope that our country
would continue to keep out of the
war and that when the time should
be opportune would be a leader in
the peace movement.
"Others to respond to toasts were
J. L. Kaliski, Mrs. Wallace, Joe G.
Williamson, W. A. Mabry, Louis
Bauer, A. D. Turner and J. F. C.
Waldo. Mr. Waldo responded to the
toast 'The Ladies,' and in the choicest
and most beautiful language he paid
tribute to the fair sex, those 'angels
of delight; bon bons of paradise.' •
"At the conclusion of the banquet
a risinag vote of thanks was extended
the Monroe lodge of Elks and the
ladies of Grace Episcopal church."
