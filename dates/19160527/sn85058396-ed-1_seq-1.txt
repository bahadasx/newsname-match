At The offensive In great force against

M is due to tho Austrian military party,

Washington, May 27. In every

because probably no national admin

United States to such a radical step
unless this step were endorsed and
understood by the people; second be
cause if any administration should so
pledge tho faith of our country and
should afterward be called upon to

so would depend on the strength of
tho public opinion endorsing the
pledge.
Officers of the league planned to so
licit $300,000 with which to carry on
tho campaign. At the proper time a
committee of the league will seek to
institute similar movements in other
countries.
President Wilson's address tonight
was expected to give an impetus to
the league's campaign plans. Many
delegates today expressed the hope
that the president would make an ut

DEATH CALLS
FRENCH IDOL
General Joseph S. Gallieni,
Former Minister of War Dies
at Home in Versailles.
SAVIOUR OF PARIS
Profound Sorrow Felt by Peo
ple of France Poor Lose
Staunch Friend.
Paris, May 27. S 25 a. m General
Joseph S. Gallieni, former minister of
war, died at Versailles today.
The death of General Gallieni while
not unexpected, created profound sor
row as he was idolized by the French
people, particularly the poor, who re
garded him as the saviour of Paris
during the critical days of August.
1914. His funeral will be the occa
sion of a notable military and civil
demonstration.
Shortly before his death an opera
tion for transfusion of blood was per
formed but it had little effect. The
general was extremely weak and was
unable to take nourishment His son
and daughter were at his bedside.
After tho notable part taken by
General Gallieni In the battle of the
Marne, when he rushed S0.000 troops
of the Paris garrison to the battle line
in taxicabs at tho crisis of the strug
gle and thereby turned the tide of
victory In favor of the French, -lie was
appointed minister of war In the re
constructed cabinet.
As war minister, General Gallieni
devoted himself with remarkable en
ergy to the elimination o-f red tape
in the administration of the army,
lie also dealt with a heavy hand with
officers who had secured posts
through favoritism or political influ
ence His first act was to forbid civil
lans to write to the generals in the
field in regard to the military mat
ters and his next was to send to the
front a "number of able bodied sol
diers, who occupied billets in the rear.
Like General Joffre he was relentless
in forcing the retirement of old offi
cers whose activities or abilities were
not equal to the demands of the war
By revision of the exempt lists he
added 80,000 men to the army.
In February of this year, General
Gallieni took over the direction of
the department of aviation, but shortlv
afterwards has was taken ill with
kidney trouble and was compelled to
resign on March G. Since then he
has been fighting a losing battle with

Young Dentists Who Killed
Father-in-law, John E. Peck,
Hears Jury's Decision.
New York, May 27. Dr. Arthur
Warren Wait was today found guilty
of the murder of his father-in-law,
John E. Peck, the Grand Rapids mil
lionaire. "Guilty of murder in tho first de
gree" was the verdict of the jury re
turned after it had been absent from
the court room one hour and twenty
five minutes.
Walte -was remanded to the Tombs
to await imposition of sentence on
Juno 1.
The summing up of the evidence
against Dr. Arthur AVarren Waite iu
his trial for tho murder of his father-in-law,
John E. Peck of Grand Rapids,
Mich., was concluded by both defense
and, prosecution soon after noon to
day. Justice Shearn then began his
charge to the jury.
Justice Shearn completed his
charge at 1-20 p. m and tho jury
went out to consider its verdict.
Walte Remains Nonchalant.
Dr. Waite entered the court room
with the same apparently resigned,
nonchalant manner that has character
ized his demeanor since the beginning
of his trial.
The prosecution promptly began its
rebuttal of tho testimony of the de
fense bearing upon Waite's alleged
imbecility and idiocy by placing on
the witness stand a neurologist, Dr.
Smith Ely Jelllffe of New York.
He testified that had determined
from an examination of Waite that
the prisoner showed no signs of de
fective Intelligence.
"He appeared as the average man
of his early life and environment,"
said Dr. Jelllffe. "My belief is that
he was an average man, somewhat
superficial, inclined to be snobbish
and of no great intellectual attain
ment. He appeared to be superficial
in that he was trying to cover up, to
conceal.
Believes Walte is Sane.
"In my opinion he was sane. I be
lieve he knew the nature of the crime
he committed and was fully aware of
all phases of it. He had sufficient
mentality to appreciate his acts. He
was sane when he killed Peck."
"Do you consider Waite a normal
man?" asked Walter Tt. Deuel, the
prisoner's counsel.
'That question cannot ho answered,"
replied Dr. Jelllffe. "He is a criminal
with a mind. Ho differs from the av
erage man In terms of psychology,-because
of his whole -life being spent
In living and feeling."
No Disturbance of Nervous System.
Dr. William Mabon also testified for
the prosecution saying he found no dis
turbance of Dr. Waito's nervous sys
tem. On some occasions when he ex
amined Waite he found the prisoner
made an effort to make false answers.
"What is your conclusion about in
sanity?" asked Assistant District At
torney Brothers.
"That he was sane," said the wit
ness. "Was he sane in your opinion when
he killed Perk?"
Sane When He Killed Peck.;
"I would say that, at the time he
killed Peck, he was sane and knew
that he was doing wrong."
Asked If he noticed that Waite
smiled while on the witness stand,
Dr. Mabon said the prisoner smiled
while he was being examined by the
alienist.
"I think he had trained himself 'for
years to be pleasant to everybody,"
he said.
Walte Smiles Broadly.
Dr. Walte smiled broadly and shrug
ged his shoulders when Dr. Mabon
testified that he believed Waite was
acting
Dr. Menas S Gregory of Bellevuc
hospital, called as a witness for the
prosecution, said he had examined
Waite in that hospital and concluded
that he was sane. He said he be
lieved and knew Waite was sane when
he killed Mr. Peck and that he knew
lie was doing wrong.

Columbus, N. M, May 27. Military
officers here are disinclined today to
believe that the forthcoming confer
ence between General Pershing and
General Gavira announced from Wash
ington will have any bearing on the
redisposltion of American troops in
the state of Chihuahua.
From all that can be learned Gen-
eral Pershing is making, adequate
preparations for a protracted stay in
Mexico. Supplies and ammunition
continue going forward daily to the
different detachments scattered along
the line of communication.
Tests of the new expeditionary bi
planes are being conducted by the
aero squadron.
Persistent rumors are continuing
in Columbus that additional troops
are to be withdrawn from General
Pershing's command to be sent to un
protected points along the Mexican
frontier.
Washington, May 27. The military,
conference ibetween Generals Persh
ing and Gavira, arranged yesterday,
will not discuss in any way the ques
tion of tho withdrawal of "the Ameri
can expedition Into Mexico. General
Funs ton's orders to General Pershing
authorizing the conference expicitly
prohibit discussion of this subject.
The conference probably will be held
at General Pershing's headquarters
at Namiquipa. Co-operation between
Mexican and American troops In
chasing bandits was the basis on
which tho Mexican officer sought the
meeting.
Pershing to Convince Gavira.
In transmitting General Gavira's
request for the conferences General
Pershing stated that he believed he
could convince General Garvira that
by cooperative action, the Carranza
and American forces could soon clear
Chihuahua state of outlaws. u
General Pershing reportea today
that there are no indications Of any
considerable Carranza forces near his
command. Reports that natives w.ore
being armed, were unfounded, he
said.
Army officials doubt reports that
30,000 Carranza troops are being
moved northward, depleting forces in
Southern Mexico.
Marathon, Tex., May 27. Major
George T. Langhorne and the two
troops of the Eighth cavalry which
lie led into Mexico in pursuit of the
Big Bend raiders, arrived here from
Boquillas this morning. They will
leave this evening for Fort Bliss, at
EI Paso, thdlr former station.
Zapata Forces Active.
Acapulco, Mexico, May 27, by radio
to San Diego, Calif., May 27. Condi
tions here are quiet but considerable
activity is reported in nearby districts
among the Zapata forces. General
Marlscal, Carranza governor at the
Querrero headquarters here, is said
to be losing prestige as the result of
dissension among subordinate leaders.
Trains were operating again today
between Guadalajara and Manzanillo
and Americans arriving at the coast
reported all quiet in- Guadelajara.
Telegram to Pershing.
El Paso, Tex., -May 27. General
Gabriel Gavira at Juarez today sent
a telegram to General J. J. Pershing
at Namiquipa suggesting that in view
of the new Carranza troop movements
it would be advisable for the com
manders to get Incoinmunicatiou to
prevent any misunderstandings or
conflicts.
General Gavira explained afterwards
that he did not think it necessary for
him to arrange a meeting with Gen
eral Pershing, as they could easily
confer by telegraph and he could
keep the Americans informed as to
troop movements at all timesx,.
Gonzales Moving Westward.
General Francisco Gonzales, com
mander of tho 1000 men sent to re
inforce General Gavira today was mow
ing his men westward from Villa Ah
muda and other pouts along the Mexi
can Central to Casas Grandes, Gale
ana and other towns in close proxim
ity to the American forces.
General Gavira said that as the
Mexicans were occupying this terri
tory he could see no good reason for
the Americans remaining.
As his first step in his policy of co
operation, General Gavira came over
to El Paso today 'for a consultation
with General Bell, in command of
Fort Bliss. It was stated that only
minor matters were discussed, relat
ing to the patrol of the border in thi3
region.
Chase of Cervantes Given Up.
Columbus, N. M., May 27. The
cause of the bandits belonging to the
Cervantes band has been given up
by tho pursuing American cavalry de
tachments without further casualties
on either sldo other than already re
ported, according to authentic infor
mation received here today.
Other advices from the front are
to tho effect that General Pershing is
calling in tho advance columns that
have been operating In the neighbor- H
hood of Las Cruces and Namiquipa. B
These troops are retiring leisurely to H
Colouia Dublan where the expedition il
is concentrating. M

El Paso, Tex., May 27. A telegram
from Mexico City to Consul Garcia ; H
says that it was principally to allay H
excitement over the entrance of the .
Sibley-Langhorn expedition Into tho ' H
Big Bend region of Coahuila, that ' H
Aguilar issued his public statement. H
The minister explained that all Amor-
lean troops entering Coahuila had en- ! H
tirely withdrawn from Mexican soil. I
In tho popular belief here, the pursuit H
of the Glenn Springs raiders upon i
Mexican soil violated the solemn as-
surances given by General Scott to I
General Obregou that no additional
American troops would be sent to M
Mexico.

POSTAL BILL
IS RENOUNCED
Fourth Assistant Postmaster I
General Tells Senate Commit fl
tee Amendments Are Sur- I
render to Railroads. fl
Washington, May 27. Fourth As- M
sistaut Postmaster General Blakslee
told the senate postoffice committee
to its face today that he considered i
its amendments to the postal bill a
surrender to the railroads and a I-
though he drew the wrath of senators
at the hearing upon him he defended i
his action in organiz:ng a campaign i j
against the amendments. i
The committee met to Investigate j
charges that Blakslee organized a
lobby. Blakslee frankly told the com. j
mittee he considered tho amendment
bad, took up the bill In detail to prove i
his charge that they were a surrender
to railroads and defiantly told the
senators of his work for their defeat.
Long Standing Controversy.
The amendments to which Blaksleo
referred concern the railway mail pay,
which is a long standing controversy
and the rural delivery. He told the I
senators they had by their amend
ments given the railroads what they
wanted and would disorganize S00
rural delivery routes and inconveni
ence 300,000 citizens. He told the
committee he had acted without the
knowledge of Postmaster General
Burleson.
Mr. Blakslee took full responsibility ,
for actions which he described m in a
statement to the effect that, based on 1
his own experienco with postal affairs
of three years and tho advice of ex
perts in the department he had reach
ed the conclusion that the amend
ments were bad. With that In mind,
he said, he telegraphed, telephoned
and wrote to every one he could to
defeat them, including postmasters,
who he asked to communicate with
their patrons and representatives in
congress. His letter declared the son- j
ale committee had made a "complete 1 j
surrender to the railroads." 1
Attack Based on Bill. 1
Senator Martine asked on what he 1
based that assertion. I
'On the bill itself," replied Mr. 1
Blaksleo. "Take the bill. The rail- I ,
roads did not want pay based on 1(
space. They got what they wanted. ' I
They wanted annual weighing. They 1 1 '
got "it. There was a provision in tho I j
house bill penalizing railroads $5,000 li
for not carrying the mails. The rail- 1
roads did not want it. It was stricken 1
out of the bill. There was a provision 1
for side service." 1
