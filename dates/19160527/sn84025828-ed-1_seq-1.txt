Experts and alleged lawyers known as

This gang claims a membership of

out judges.
Thero aro over 65,000 lawyers In
Chicago.
Tho colleges and law schools of the
state turn out between 4,000 and 5,000
new lawyers every year so that tho
number of barristers Is constantly In
creasing. But of tho great and Increasing
number of lawyers very fow belong to
tho Bar Association.
That there are sovoral good lawyers
In tho Bar Association cannot bo de
nied. That a great number of good law
yers can be found around any freo
' lunch counter cannot bo denied either.
Why 1,400 men should docido upon
judicial timber for 500,000 voters Is
something too hard to guess.
The lawyers who patronize tho freo
lunch ought to have as much influence
with the public as the lawyers who
chime in with the aggregation of job
hunters sometimes referred to as the
Bar Association.
Almost every other man whom you
meet In Chicago not connected with

the number Is Increasing;

committees, sitting as conventions as
tho law provides for such exigency.

voters that they re-elect tho sitting

asks for his place. Good Judicial serv
