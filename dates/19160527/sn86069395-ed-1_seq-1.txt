cutting of alfalfa be saved as each
grower will be expected to exhibit a
sample at each cutting, and make a
complete display.

Boom in Prices Has Set the
Farmers Wild With
Hope.
Tobacco prices soared again this
week, with an average oj $8.34 for
the 425,165 pounds sold on the loose
floor market. The recent high prices
have raised the season's average
more than $1.75. The boom has had
the effect of causing the acreage of
the new crop to be materially in
creased. Plants are plentiful, the
season is espcially favorable so far
and the crop is being planted as fast
as hills can be made.
There were some prices as high as
$13 again this week and the entire
market was very satisfactory.
Week ending May 25, 1916, is as
as follows:
Receipts for week 0 Hhds.
Receipts for year 78 Hhds.
Sales for week 0 Hhds.
Sales for year 245 Hhds.
