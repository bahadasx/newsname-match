to rciieat tit word. Waltc's
faalier was overwhelmed with
esaoUon and wcjm wildly. The
other sons vainly trlixl to eura

NBW YORK, Muy 27 The prose
cution and defense both rested In the
murder trial of Walte at 11 o'clock
this morning. The ease probably will
go to the Jury this afternoon. Walte
may know hl fate tonight.
The Jury retired at 1:J0 this after
noon. Without emotion Walte gaxed
at the prosecutor and his brothers
steadily when he heard himself de
nosaeed aa a cruel, cunning murderer.
He was similarly unmoved during
the address of the defense attorney.
Ifirte state alienists declared posi
tively that they believed Walte was
vane when he committed the crimes
and wai sane now. They admitted
h was not normal and classified him
as a born criminal. The defense
seised eagerly upon these assertions
and declared that the state experts
realty believed that Waite was de
langed. The prosecutor ridiculed
Walt's Insanity. "Is this the kind of
maa you want sent to Matteawan
where he will walk to freedom some
morning when the milkman comes
u round?"
The defense objected to this refer
ence to the Thaw case and the re
marks were stricken from the rec
ord. Ma brothers charged that Walte
had ruined Mrs. Horton's life and
li,red her from her husband. They
detktred that except for the mysteri
ous K. Adams who sent a telegram
ihrowing suspicion on Walte. he
might be still walking the streets
without a suspicion of Insanity.

to United States
VtXIOTIATIONS TO BK DIFFICULT
UWt'Al si: OF FORMER AT
TITUDE. (By Phillip simms )
PtrTROGRAD, May 27. The Unit
ed Mates faces tremendous difficulties
io attempting to negotiate a new com
mercial treaty with Russia to replace
the one abrogated by the Taft admin
Istratlon because of the Jewish ques
tioa, It was learned on highest author
ity today. Negotiations were begun
six months too late, as the allies aro
now perfecting a trade agroument am
ong themselves. Until this Is con
eluded Russia will not make outside
arrangements If a treaty is accom
plished It must confine Itself to eco
mimics and not enter a discuBSlon of
liasHla's Internal affairs.
Count Kokokovstoff. former premier
and minister of finance, In an exelu
.ilve Interview with the United Press
made it plain that Itussla would not
consider a treaty If treatment of the
Jews was made an Issue.
"America ought to reullze that Ilus
it cannot entertain outside sugges
tions regarding Its Internal affairs
Americans must come like any others,
leaving Itussla to settle its interior
problems.
"I am not anti-Jew. My record is a
proef of this. I admire America, 1
welcome American cooperation In
halleing Industries, railroads and open
ng the vast resources of raw material
of every sort. Before the war Ger
many had made no special demands on
Itussla. Having ulterior motives, Ger
many scattered the wildest stories
against Russia, making trouble, and In
the meanwhile virtually monopolising
trade."

Tri-State Co. Has Tentative
Scheme For Grain Cleaning
Plant Located in Pendleton
To establish a wheat cleaning and
grading plant In Pendleton for the
purpose of cleaning wheat to be ship
ped east In bulk is being actively dis
cussed In farmers union circles and
it is said that tentative plans for such
un establshment are likely to be car
ried out.
If the enterprise Is carried through
It will mean an Important new Indus
try for Pendleton and that a large
part of the wheat of the Inland em
pire will be shipped east via Pendle
ton and here cleaned and graded In
transit The plan contemplated at
present calls for use of the property
on East Webb street, owned by the
Furmers Union. The property pro
vides trackage arrangements with
both railroads and is adapted to the
purpose of a cleaning plant.
It Is thought a $50,000 Investment
will answer the purpose for this sea
son and It is possible a less sum may
be sufficient to get the plant In opera
tion. The business will be established
and operated by the Tri-State Termi
nal Warehouse Co and It Is planned
to have the company buy grain direct,
then clean and grade It and sell in the
Judge Phelps Refuses to Order
Parkes to Grant Change of Venue
in Case Against Mayor J. A. Best
Circuit Judge U. W. Phelps this
nioriiiiiK handed down a declslun and
opinion in which he refused to order
Justice of the Peace Joe H. Parkes
to grunt a change of venue to Mayor
J. A. Hest for the trial of the latter
on a charge of vagrancy.
Judge Phelps holds in effect that
his court has no power to mandamus
the Justice of the peace under the
law.
The law states that a court may
grant a change of venue when an af
fidavit Is made charging that the tri
al court is so prejudiced that a fair
and impartial trial cannot be held.
Mayor Best's attorneys contended
that the "may" should be construed
as "must." thus making It mandatory
upon the justice court to grant the
change when such affidavit Is made.
District Attorney Stelwer contended
that it was discretionary with the
court.
Judge Phelps In his opinion states
that it has been repeatedly held by
the supreme court that the right to
change a place of trial rests In the
sound discretion of the trial court and
that the riiliio; of this court will not
be disturbed on an appeal unless It
Members of Largest Class in
History of High School Get
Coveted Diplomas Last Night
With not less than 800 relatives and
friends of the 55 graduates in attend
ance at the commencement program
of the high school last evening, me
capacity of the large auditorium was
taxed to the very limit Those in at
tendance had the pleasure of seeing
the exit from the school of the largest
graduating class In history and of lis
tening to a brilliant commencement
program, the chief address being by
Dr. S. B. L. Penrose of Whitman Col
lege. Dr. Penrose developed the Idea that
there Is an Implied contract between
the community and students of the
high school and that in return for the
educational advantages given them It
Is Incumbent upon students to show
civic loyalty, uphold advanced prin
ciples and generally perform the du
ties of educated men and women Ho
complimented the class and the high
school and predicted that the future

cost of their education.
Dr. Penrose was introduced by Su
perintendent A. C Hampton, who wa

school board, who is now retiring from
office after 10 years of service on the
board. Mr. Tallman spoke In some
detail of the upbuilding of the local
schools In the last decade and partic
ularly of the establishment of the
practical courses In the high school.
Miss Marguerite Straughan of the
graduating class, gave a rleaalng sa
lutatory and the valedictory was by
Emll Selbert who called upon his
classmates to search for the real gold
of life and to live up to the responsi
bilities devolving on the class because
of the advantages of the school work.
east Buyers from the east have
promised to have agent here to rep
resent them
The proposal for a cleaning plant
here Is based on the fact that consid
erable loss occurs from shipping un
cleaned wheat east. As there exists
uncertainty as to the exact quality of
the grain it is Impossible to sell It at
fair prices on the Atlantic The sit
uation has led to a suggestion from
Portland that a rate De secured where
by the wheat can be cleaned in tran
sit In Portland and then sold In the
east on a graded boats
It Is argued however, that Pendle
ton is a more logical place for a
cleaning plant Inasmuch as a 500 mile
haul would be saved and hence a bet
ter rate east enjoyed Another aspect
of the affair is that such a plant hero!
would lie of aid In promoting the use
of grain In bulk.
There Is a feeling that Portland and
Sound interests are unfriendly to bulk
grain because the sack business Is
profitable to them With a cleaning
and grading establlsnment here under
farmers' union control It is said a
iitmtiMt it inn wnllM Iwi nrnvMnl . it h
benefit to the graingrowers
Ik clear that there was an abuse of
discretion.
Where any of the statutory causes
for a change exist, Judge Phelps holds
that the trial court Is bound to allow
the motion, but as to whether or not
the cause does exist in fact the court
is vested with discretion subject to re
view only for the abue of this discre
tion. A writ of mandamus is intend
ed by law to compel a court to per
form some duty enjoined by law and
not to control judicial discretion, he
holds Therefore, he ordered the
writ issued In the case to be quashed
and overruled the demurrer filed by
the mayor.
It Is possible that Mayor Best can
appeal from Judge Phelps' decision
to the supreme court in which event
it would probably be November be
fore the case could be brought to
1 trial. Unless the mayor does appeal
I now, he must stand trial before Jus
j tice of the Peace Parkes.
