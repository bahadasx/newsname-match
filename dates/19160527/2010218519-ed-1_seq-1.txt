Memorial Day
MEMORIAL day serv
K ices will this year
be held in the church-
ies and cemeter
& ies tomorrow. It is a
I sacred day and becomes
more and more impres
sive with every coming.
It originated in a strug-
Igle to give expression
to the sorrow for the
glorified ones who died
in our great Civil war,
and to honor their ex
alted memories. At the
time those who had di
rectly engaged in that
Avar and had survived
it were a mighty host;
an invincible army of
! heroes. The remnant of
i them left add now a pa-
I thetic sadness to the
day. Their bent forms,
I their halting steps, their
I dimmed eyes, are all
I notices that their march
I is about over; that they
I cannot much longer
1 hold their places in the
I ranks, that the muffled
I drums and funeral
! plumes are, for them,
.' about to take the places
of the old flashing flag
I and the bugle's call.
if Every morning's news
k from across the sea
,t adds to the solemnity
'L of the day.
This last war was so
' causeless; its sacrifices
i ' are so awful; the wreck
that it has already
made; the brave hearts
! . that under its blows
ij A have ceased to beat are
so countless, the hearts
" broken by its attritions
i are so comfortless; the
i empty cradles it has
t made; the woes that
must follow it; over-
f shadow the whole
world, and make every
I" murmur of the breeze
t that comes in from
r across the eastern sea
seem like a requiem.
. A And with it all comes
the knowledge that be-
, cause of it, our respon
sibilities, both as a na
tion and as individuals,
will be much increased.
" An unnumbered host
V will be left from it,

As many as can will M
flee from those blood- M
stained lands and those M
who can will naturally M
drift to our shores. '1
Our country has as- M
similated many millions M
from .abroad. Can we M
do so with these? What H
will our own hosts of M
laborers do when M
brought in direct com- M
petition with these H
starving ones? That is H
only one of the new
questions that will come
up. What are to be the H
new trade relations H
with the world? The H
war has distinctly low- H
ered the civilization in H
what was the world's H
most enlightened cen- H
ters. ..How is the restor- H
ation to begin to cover H
the mighty wreck? But H
when soldiers bury a H
comrade who has been H
overborne by the bolts H
of war or the blows of H
peace, they play dead H
marches to the grave, H
but returning though a H
battle may be immi- H
nent, all their music is iH
Joyous music, a remind- il
er that the world's work !
(is still to be done and jH
it is man's duty to per- J
form it, whether it .H
leads up toward the jH
flight or down to the M
darkness and silence. JM
That thought should M
underly men's minds to- 'M
morrow. Ours is the M
most blessed of coun- H
tries. M
Its skies are bright; H
its soil is incubating H
what promises to be a S H
banner harvest; no pes- M
tilence is devastating , H
any part of it and H
peace .wraps it round ' H
like a shining robe. H

the heartaches of the j I
living, we should not r fl
repine. There is too jl
