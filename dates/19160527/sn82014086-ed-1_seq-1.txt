ARTILLERY OF BOTH SIDES
British and Germans Have Confined Their Recent Fighting
Merely to Bombarding Engagements and Sapping Ope

Eighteen Persons Killed in
Heavy fightinjr in the region of Ver
dun continues, with the Germans still
the aggressors, but according to the
latest French communication . no
changes in positions have taken place.
Following up their recapture of Fort
Douaumont, northeast of Verdun, the
Germans have striven, but ineffectual
ly, to drive out the French from the
approaches to the fort, where they
drew their lines when forced to va
cate the fort itself.
Their attack was strong but Paris
reports that under the fire of the
French infantry and rapid flrers U was
completely repulsed, the Germans suf
fering heavy casualties. This was the
only infantry attack in all the Verdun
region, says Paris, but the artillery of
both sides has been extremely active
on all sectors, especially in the region
of Avocourt and Hill 304.
The British and Germans have con
fined their recent fighting mainly to
bombarding engagements and sapping
operations. There have been several
minor infantry attacks and bomb
throwing expeditions by both sides,
but in these no material advantage ac
crued to either. :. Comparative calm

Chinese - Press Comments on Rumors
Emanating From Japan.
Pekin. May . 26. Rumors that
Japan is planning to have China ad
ministered by an international com
mission have created much comment
in the Chinese press. This idea is not
new In Japan but has frequently been
mentioned in Japanese newspapers. Re
cently, however, the discussion of this
means to preserve peace in China has
been very insistent In the Japanese
press.
The Japanese idea is that all leadlner
puwors interested in umna as well as
Chinese would have representation in
the commission, but Japan would be
the controlling influence supported by
the Entente Powers. This plan would
involve an absolute recognition of
.japans special position 4n the Far
iast, ror which the JaDanese have been
striving with renewed vigor since the
opening or tne European war.

ANOTHER VISIT TO EUROPE
. BY COL. HOUSE INTIMATED,
Berlin Said to Hope It Will Be as a
. Harbinger of Peace.
Berlin, Tuesday, "May 23, 10 p. m.f
via London, May 26, 6.30 p. m. An
other visit toy Col. E. !M. House to Eu
rope, would come as no surprise to
initiated quarters here. The Ameri
can rumors to this effect are regarded
as having a certain basis in fact, al
though the opinion prevails that ttoe
trip would naturally be postponed un
til after the national conventions.
It is hoped here that should Colonel
House pay such a visit toe will come
this time, as a harbinger of peace, or
at any rate, to prepare,- if possible, the
foundations for a peace proposal, diffi
cult as this task is recognized to toe. .
During his last previous visit to
Europe Colonel House made no effort
and conducted no investigations in the
direction of peace in Berlin, at any
event having perhaps round absolute.
ly adverse conditions in capitals of
nations hostile to Germany. Presuma
bly, also, fee had previous information
that American mediation was under no
circumstances desired, and that it
would not be accepted as long as the
unitea estates continued to supply Ger.
many's foes with cannon, shot, shell
cartridges, power and a thousand and
one other requisites for waging wai
against the central -powers, while -no
intimation had been given at Che time
oi tnis visit the irascibility in high
quarters here on the munitions ques
tion was in any way abated. ,
; The situation has now (flanged. Ap
parently, there is no harm, from either
a political or a strategic standpoint, in
saying -that Germany would welcome
peace. As Arthur von Gwinner, the
managing director of : the Deutsche
bank in Berlin, .-stated to The Asso
dated Press - correspondent recently
"Germany is in the position of a poker
player Who has gathered in all the
money on the taMe and naturally is j
willing to break off an all-night ses
sion arid retire with his winnings,
vliile the others persist in continuing .
in me nope oi recouping some or their
losses. The cards, however, to con
tinue the simile, are running strongly
in the Germans' favor, it is pointed ou t,
as shown in the renewed postponement
of the long-heralded Anglo-French of
fensive in the west, the steady though
siow-progress ot the crown prince at
Verdun, the victories of the Turks, and
finally the crushing results of the Aus
trian offensive in the Trentino."
Whether these events are enoueh to
Induce the allies to Tetire from what
is looked UBon here as a losine came.
and whether the changed tone, of the
utterances of Premier Asauitfc and Sir
Edward Grey and what is considered a
disavowal, or tneir intention to-crusr
Germany as a nation-and -a ieotmher
ciai rival, or dismember the empire
are indicative of receptivity toward
reasonable i peace proposals is an un
certain factor.' . .

FIRST ANNUAL MEETING OF
LEAGUE TO ENFORCE PEACE.
Slight Reference Made to Ending the
Present War.
Washington, 31ay 26. The League to
Enforce Peace, formed a year ago,
wi.ti the aim of securing a lasting
world peace at the close of the Euro
pean war, held its first annual meeting
hree today and heard its - president.
William H. Taft, and other men
prominent in the country's affairs ttate
the purpose of the organization and
outline what it hopes to accomplish.
(slight reference was made to ending
the present war. The opening decla
ration by Mr. Taft in calling the meet
ing to order was that the league was
not urging the administration to take
steps to stop the conflict.'. Some dele
gates, though,, expressed a - hope that
such a movement would srrow out 01
the meeting and did not disguise their
'belief, that President. Wilson s peace
address tomorrow night might be sig
nificant in this connection. -
The league's decision to confine its
efforts to establishing a permanent
peace for the future was described by
Mr. Taft as developing from a belief
that a definite purpose, with limita
tions, was- more likely to be realized
than if the league essayed too much.
Although we look with tlie greatest
satisfaction on any Indications tha
the war is to come to an end," he said.
to introduce here movements looking
to this end would weaken our driving
force." -
At a luncheon officers of the league
and deleeatea started a movement to
raise $300,000 to establish' branches of
the league in every state in the union
and for preliminary efforts to institute
branches abroad... : . ;
