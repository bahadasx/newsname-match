If the ocean is the nations'
highway, somebody ought to see
that some of those holes are filled
up where so many vessels have
sunk.
At an expense of $1,044.15 to
tlie taxpayers of Stevens county,
the republican state board of
checkers has completed its annual
sojourn among us and left for
other parts. The members of the
board which have come to us the
last two years are Messrs. lirown
ami Rummell, two of the best
men on the board, it having been
deemed unsafe to send the other
kind any longer after the Exam
iner's exposition a few years ago
of the political inside of the board
work at the hands of the men who
were being sent, and in view of
the publicity given to the fact
that our county clerk L. ('. Rich
ardson had been obliged to check
up the work of the checkers and
show them their errors in figur
ing.
.Messrs. Brown and Rummell
found conditions quite good in
our midst, none of the officials
having stolen any money so far
as the checkers could discover.
The absence of automobiles among
courthouse employes tended to
show that they were spending a
reasonable amount of their time
at county business, and the cleanly
condition of the building evidenc
ed the systematic labor of the
janitor in earning his compensa
tion.
These reports, together with
the pleasure of having strangers
with us occasionally, are probably
well worth the $1,044 paid by the
taxpayers, inasmuch as the voters
of this county voted to continue
this board of checkers
What is regarded as the moftt
effective remedy for drugstore
"bootlegging," which in Seattle,
at least, has attained the eminence
of art and industry combined, lias
been proposed by Governor Lis
ter in a recent suggestion to the
state Board of Pharmacy. The
goVernor advises the board that
state licenses issued to pharma
cists can legally be revoked be
cause of convictions for violating
the dry law, thus making the law
bring the conditions for which it
was enacted. The governor is
not at all slow in enforcing the
law of the state, and while poli
ticians have been quibbling over
methods of getting results from
the law, he has in a few words
told how to do it.
The intent of the law is that
druggists shall sell the liquor
which is sold in the state, and law
abiding people will buy from their
local druggist. But the law docs
not contemplate a drugstore
which carries no drug stock hut
which does carry a large liquor
stock, and the regular drug trade
will appreciate the vigilance of
officials in protecting the legiti
mate drug trade by stopping the
liquor drug stores which carry
no drug stocks.
The socialists seem to believe
that "the early bird catches the
worm." Through a referendum
vote of the socialist party mem
bership of the state of Washing
ton, they have already decided
whom to nominate as their state
candidates. Their ticket will be
headed by Bruce Rogen of Scat
tic for United .States senator and
1.. B. Katterfeld of Everett for
governor, John M. Powers of
Culville has been selected as can
didate for congressman from tin
fifth district, and E. E. Owsley of
Colrilli for state auditor.
At the present time a referen
dum of the socialists of Stevens
enmity is pending for the nomina
tion of ii county ticket. County
Secretary I'owers announces that
the final returns on the referen
dum will be about June 20, tfter
that date the nominees of the so
cialist party for county office will

Three hundred Inland Empire
farmers who met in Spokane last
week decided almost unanimously
n favor of discarding sacks for
tiii- bulk handling of grain. Farm
ers and warehousemen who have
been awaiting the decision of this
'vention will be making changes
ii their farm storage facilities and
warehouses in the next 60 days.
The essence of the meeting was
the reaching of the conclusion that
hulk handling effects a net saving
of 21/ i cents per bushel. The total
cost per bushel of handling wheat
in sack's was found to be 2fi :i/ic,
in hulk 21VaO per bushel. Sub
tracting three cents for return of
sacks the net saving is found to
be 2 1/ic It has been fully dem
onstrated that the present flat
warehouses can be successfully
adapted, at comparatively small
expense, to handling grain in bulk.
Full assurance lias been given by
the railway officials and terminal
warehouses thai they will mccl
farmers and interior warehouse
men in arranging for the full
handling of grain in bulk. Tn
answer to the argument that grain
must be sacked for exporting from
the Pacific, coast, authentic re
ports show that less than 25 per
cent of the grain from the north
west is exported annually, and
the Panama canal has removed the
necessity of sacking the greater
part of the small percentage of the
crop that is exported. The grain
prices in the world's market are
quoted on a hulk basis, therefore
there will be no difference in the
price of bulk grain or sacked
grain when the bulk system pre
vails throughout this territory.

TALKS ON BANKING.

WHEN YOU BORROW MONEY
lii Ih tune of human events
ii becomes necessary for most
people to borrow money, lousi
ness men who oan make 10 per
cent or more out of trading find
il profitable to borrow in order
to carry on business on a larger
scale, discount their bills and car
ry complete stocks. Others find
it desirable at times to borrow for
various purposes, and some find
it necessary to borrow because
they have either failed to save,
or have been unable to save and
are .confronted with an exigency
that requires money.
Should you tit any time find
yourself in such a condition, do
nut borrow from your friends, go
to your bank. Tliut is what
banks are for, They live by their
loans, and no banker will refuse
a loan ihiit meets certain require
ments iiii< t is in his estimation
good, it is proposed in the next
two or three talks on banking to
I ell vi hi what the banker wants
to know when you offer him your
note, Whether the loan is large
ur small the same rules apply.
lii the lirsi place the banker
will expeel you to be a depositor.
Musi banks make it a rule to Lend
ii only those who are customers,
iiml customers mean depositors.
ll' you favor the banker with
your account, gving him a profil
From the use of your money, he
will be glad In reciprocate and
lei you use his money when you
need it ami offer the proper se
curity. The rule is well estab
lished tv lend in the proportion
of m>i nvcr five to one ; that is, if
you keep a balai >f $100, the
banker would lend you $500, if
he llniim'ht well of your credit
standing. The greatest mistake
IniHiiißMH men make is to keep little
or iki balance in the bank and then
i'Xjh'H the liank to accommodate
them with loans,
Take an acl ual case t hat hap
piMicil recently within the experi
ence of the writer of these talks.
A business man wanted a note of
#100 discounted to meet his pay
rail. The hanker knew him. His
moral standing was good. In
looking up the accouni his bal
ance was lull .")() cents. Now
what did that indicate .' -lust
this: Thai the would-be borrower
had trusted everybody until his
capital was on his books, lure,
there and everywhere, and he was
not collecting his hills. He had
no "free money" to carry on bis
business, lie had no working
capital. lie was ''strapped."
The banker was perfectly justi
fied in asking the borrower either
to make better collections, or get
hi-, affairs in such shape that when
pay day came he would not have
lo depend upon borrowed money
In pay his men.
Nothing so hurls :ui application
For a loan in a well managed bank
hn a low average balance, and all
Ifood banken give heed to this
Paotor. Therefore, uh q itarting
point, 'I" your biuiaeM through
;i bank, depositing your reoeipta
;111 < I making your payment* by
> ■ 11<-<• l<. and keep a balance large
enough to gain the banker'■ good
will when In; looks aI, Ins ledgers
to see how much of your own
money you have available when
tin- needs of business require.
Don't do rill your business on bor
rowed money, for if the banker
finds 1 it out, he won't discount
your noli;. .
