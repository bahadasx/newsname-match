field.
A ringing platform was adopt- j
ed, affirming allegiance to the I
national Democratic party, cornm- a
mending the administration of a
President Wilson, and denounc- c
ing political perfidy as was prac
ticed in the late State campaign.
More than six hundred quali
fied delegates attended the con
vention, and fully two thousand
visitors were said to have been,:
in Baton Rouge, attracted by the i
gathering. It developed, how- 
ever, that the House of Repre
sentatives was entirely too small I
for such a crowd, and only one a
or two hundred were able to a
squeeze in among the delegates.
A great deal of enthusiasm I
,prevailed, marked by perfect
harmony during the proceedings. 1
No opposition was offered to the
I- "big four" delegates at large,
). who were elected unanimously.
L All the district delegates were ,s
's agreed on in caucus, and were sa
's ratified unanimously by the con- P
f vention. bi

Take Po-Do-Lax in Spring.
In winter our blood gets thick, our
pores close, we feel tired and dull when
hot days come. What we need is a
spring liver tonic, something to rid our
system of winter's accumulated waste.
Po-Do-Lax will do it. I stimulates the
bile, empties the bowels. The organs
become more active and in a little
while you feel like new. Don't neg
