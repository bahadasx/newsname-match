INTERFERENCE
Administration Protests to Great
Britain and France
RADICAL CHANGE IS DEMANDED
Claims Will Be Pressed for Losses
Which Americans Have Already
Suffered.
Washington, May 27. The United
States, denouncing interference with
neutral mails, has notified Great Brit
ain and France that it can no longer
tolerate the wrongs which American
citizens have suffered und continue to
suffer through the "lawless practices"
those governments have indulged in,
and that only a radical change in poli
cy, restoring the United States to its
full rights as a neutral power will he
satisfactory.
This notification is given in the lat
est American communication to the
two governments, the text of which
was made public by the state depart
ment last night. The time in which
the change must be effected is not
specified, but the United States ex
pects prompt action.
"Onerous and vexatious" abuses
which have been perpetrated by the
British and French governments in
seizing and censoring neutral mails
are recited in the communication, and
answers are made to the legal argu
ments contained in the reply of the
entente governments to the first Amcr
lean note on the subject.
It is vigorously set forth that
not only have American commercial
interests been Injured, but the rights
of property have been violated and
the rules of international law and cus
tom palpably disregarded. Notice is
served that the United States
soon will press claims against
the British and French governments
for the losses which already have been
suffered.

Berlin Comment on Wilson Speech
Shows Receptive Mood.
Berlin, via London, May 25. Presi
dent Wilson's reference to the possi-
bilitv of American mediation in the
war, made in the course of his speech
nt Charlotte. N. C has been seized
upon with interest by the German pub
lie. A digest of his address has been
received bv wireless and the news
papers give it prominence and com
nient upon it. editorially as well.
Althtugh the German press does not
make the definite statement, it is ap
parent from the tone of the comment
that mediation by the United States
would be welcomed at the present
time. The disposition to refuse Amcr!
ca's service in this line because of her
munitions exports seems to have dis
appeared from the press and the pub
lie mind and it is believed Germany
will cheerfully accept the President as
a mediator provided he can show any
definite possibilities of results. This
condition, however, U a prerequisite
for Germany is not desirous of accept
ing America's good ollices only to have
the Allies reject the tender and assert
that the Teutons are suing for peace
BRITISH PENSION 10,000 MEN
Naval Prize Money Already More Than
$22,000,000.
London, May 2". Ten thousand (lit
charged British soldiers are receiving
Government gratuities, according to a
Ftafement made In the House of Com
mons today by Henry William Forster,
member from Sevenoaks, Kent.
In the House of Lords Baron Newton
said there were 4,000 British civilian
prisoners in Germany and 27.000 Ger
mans interned in Great Britain. Also,
continued Baron Newton, the number
of British who have been repatriated
was 028 and that 1,100 Germans have
been repatriated.
The Duke of Devonshire said that
naval prize money amounted to more
than $22,000,000, in addition to the
prize money now in the hands of of II-
eluls of the colonies. I he. snips cap
tured so far from enemies of the A I

French Driven Backwards Lose
Prisoners and Machine Guns
INFANTRY ACTIONS CONTINUE
Both Sides Claim Slight Gains
But
Results Are Far From
Decisive.
London. May 20. Severe infantry
actions continue in the Uouauinont re
gion northeast of Verdun, but without
decisive results. In fact, both sides
claim today slight gains in that hotly
contested area.
Berlin asserts that German troops'
extended their positions to the west
of lliiiulroinont quarry and across the
Doiiamnont ravine. South of Fort de
Uouauinont, it is added, the French
were driven back further and an ad
ditional tltui prisoners and V2 machine
guns were captured.
The day bulletin of the French War
Ollice states that the French succeed
ed in recovering part of tho trenches
occupied yesterday by the Germans
between Haudromont Wood and Thiau
niont farm.
Tonight's official communication
from Paris reports that a strong at
tack was made bv German lorces on
the French trenches south of Fort de
iKiiiaumont, but that it was repulsed.
That Fort de Houaumont. was never
l ctaken by the French is now asserted
by the German supreme military com
mand, according to a dispatch from
rlin. It is possible, it is declared,
that isolated patrolling parties may
have readied approach trenches south
of the fort, but none of tlieni ever
t merged except as prisoners. Since
Fort de Dotiautnout was first reported
taken, on Feb. 25, it has been continu
ously tn tierman possession, it is as
serted.
Heavy artillery fire was the only
feature of activity on the west side of
the Mouse late last night and today,
According to Paris, the Germans at'
tempted an attack on Dead Man Hill,
but were stopped at the outset by the
Ficnch curtain ot fire.
INQUIRY IN CUBLIN
Police Chief Telia of Origin of Sinn
Fein Movement.
Dublin, via London, May 25. The
Koyal Commission appointed to invest i
gate the Irish rebellion transeferred
Its sitings to Dublin today.
Col. Sir Neville Chamberlain, Inspec
tor general of the Koyal Irish Constab
ulary, testified regarding the history
of the Sinn Fein movement and the
methods- adopted by the police in ob
taining information concerning it. He
said that when the movement was first
started in Ph'j it was rather moderate
but extremists obtained control and
after the outbreak of the l.uropean
war pamphlets were circulated with
the purpose of turning sentiment
against the English ami to hinder re
fruiting.
At tho time of the coronation of
King George, be said, the Sinn Fein-
ers made a futile efiort at a demon
stration. When the I'lster Volunteers
were organized at the time of the ex
citenient over home rule the organiz
ation of the Irish national volunteers
was suggested.
Col. Johnson, Commissioner of the
Dublin mttropolitan police, was asked
why h could not act on his own Initia
tive if a crime were being committed.
He replied that under his orders if an
arrest was likely to involve political
considerations he had to make a re
pore.
In reply to questions he denied the
truth of reports that a mimic attack
on Dublin Castle had been made last
year or that the Sinn Feiners had dug
tunnils tor communication umong
houses In Dublin.
WANT KING IN IRELAND
Nationalists Urge Establishment of a
Royal Residence There.
London, May 25. There has been
much speculation with reference to
Pennler Asquith's foi thcoming state
incut on Irish affairs. The world old
problem of Ireland Is not likely to be
solved right uwuy, but it is hoped that
the Premier will at least be enabled to
state that the informal negotiations
now afoot w ill lead to some sort of
settlement.
The only common ground between
the Irish parties so far Is the condem
nation ot uie nuniin castle govern
ment, which Is regarded, us a leading
Irishman wittily put It, as "having
broken down." He continued:
"Fur the last time tho only thing ah
solutely certain Is that there will be
a chance hi the method of the Irish
government, whether the parties come
to an agreement or not. The Nation
ullsls desire that the royal residence
should he set up In Ireland, where the
King should reside .part of the year
the same ns in the past lie has resided
at Balmoral Castle in Scotland."

Only Insane Knowledge of
Right and Wrong.
New York, May L'. Both sides in
the trial ot Arthur Warren Waite, the
young dentist charged with the poison
ing cf his wealthy father iu law, J. E.
Peck of Grand Itapids, Mich., rested
before noon today. The jury as
charged und retired and a verdict is
cxi ected before night.
New York. May 27. Alienists sworn
bv the defense in behalf of Dr. Arthur
Warren Waite testtled yesterday at his
ttial for the murder of John E. Peck,
his tather-in-law, thut the young
dentist was a "moral imbecile" and
"an immoral monster," who had only
an insane Knowledge oi rigni ami
w rong. I tie oetense rested us case
upon the testimony of the mental ex
perts and the alienists of the prosecu
tion will appear to-day in rebuttal.
Walte's wife was in the court rooiii
again yesterday nfternoon and heard
the medical witnesses for her husband
testify he had told them lie married
her only for her money. The prisoner
himself appeared to doze while a long
hypothetical question, designed to
thow that he was insane at the time
he killed h's wife's parent, was read
to the alienists. The jurymen seemed
somewhat bored by tho experts' testi
mony.
Dr. Maurice J. Karpas and Dr. Allan
Boss Diefcndorf both testltled that
Waite was a moral Imbecile and de
clared they had -arrived ut their con
clusion without consulation together.
Until admitted Waite knew what he
was doing when he was plotting the
.death of Mr. Peck, but they declared
he had no moral sense. Both asserted
they did not want the prisoner set
free, and Dr. Diel'endorf said he should
be kept In an insane asylum as long
as he lived.

HUGHES ENDORSED
BV REPUBLICAN
COilUEHi
Delegates Reaffirm Expressed
Choice of Primary Election
FRANK E. HOWE PRESIDES
Only One Contest in Election of Dele
gates to National Convention at
Chicago.
Montpelier. May 27. Republicans in
state convention yesterday unanimous
ly adopted u resolution endorsing Jus
tics Charles K. Hughes foJ Jhe Repub
lican presidential nomination. The re
solution was presented by Clarke (.'.
Fitts of Bi attloboro, and the mention
of the name of Hughes provoked an en
thusiastic demonstration on the part
ol the convention, which lasted for sev
eral minutes. Mr. Fitts' resolution was
as follows:
The Republican state convention
of Vermont endorses and affirms the
spoken word of the Republican vot
ers of the state in favor of Charles
K. Hughes for the presidential nom
ination. We believe that his un
blemished record, his wide experi
ence, his forceful character And lib:
great intellect combine to make him
the master hand to navigate the ship
of state across the uncharted shoals
which are ahead. We urge that the
delegates elected by this convention
by their personal efforts and by their
votes support him with the full
strength of the state.
The convention did not meet until
ll. 20 and took a recess at 12 until 1.30.
Five hundred and eighteen ol the till
delegates were present. The ((inven
tion organized by selecting ex-Lieutenant
Governor Frank E. Howe of Ben
nington as temporary chairman and
Warner R. (Ira ham of Rockingham
and Benjamin Williams of Proctor
as temporary secretary and assistant
secretary, respectively. This organi
zation was later made permanent. The
convention had been called to order bv
Stanley C. Wilson of Chelsea, chair
man of the state committee and prayer
had been offered bv Rev. Stanlev V.
Blomfield of Montpelier.
Mr. Howe, in taking the chair, ad
dressed the convention as follows:
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the
convention :
The Republican party this year
stands on the outside looking in and
it is a good place to be not often but
once in a while. I lie actor wiio is al
ways on the stage forgets how the
ay looks irom the pit and the gal
lery.
The directors of a bank sitting
around the long table behind closed
oors are in danger of sometimes for
getting the people whose money they
handle, and without whose confidence
ind deposits the bank would be of as
little value and importance as an emp
ty tin can in a junk dealer's back yard
The executive board of a railroad com
pany or other public service corpora
tlon often suffers from Inability to un
dcrstand the point of view from which
its acis are considered.
The Republican party has held the
enter of the arena so continuously
tor the past two generations that it
nine to consider Itself impregnable
mil secure, like t aesar s wlte. aoove
uspicion. Perhaps it needed the les
son ot 1912 and the years followln
nyhow it is for the party to profit
by that lesson and to face the future
hastened by its defeat and prepared
to resume the responsibility which the
signs of the times indicate is to In
again placed upon the Republican
party by the voters of the I nited
States on the first 1 uesday of next
November.
If the liepuhlican party needed a
lesson the country needed it more
I'lie affairs of the nation had been
conducted so long and so successfully
by the statesmen of the Republican
party that the country had utmost for
gotten that It could be plunged into
business depiesslon and started on
the road toward national discredit and
disgrace by the mistaken acts of an
administration, meaning well, but
building on a foundation of theorcti
cal rather than of practidil service
We have no quarrel with tho Individ
ual members of the Peniocratic party.
They are our neighbors and our friends
and are just as patriotic nnd pure
minded as we. We admire and ap
pluud their idealism and we doubt not
the sincerity of their motives. But
we question their judgment and lament
tho distressing failure of their gov
ernmental ideas, A rainbow Is a
beautiful thing but the strength of its
arch does not warrant its use as a
chief support.
The Democratic doctrines sound
well enough when cleverly spoken.
but so also do the stories of Baron
Munchausen. It Is only when the
doctrines of the Democracy are put In
effect that their weakness Is shown
The country has had upwards of three
years experience now of absolute
Dcnioctatlc control of government and
it Is enough to make the blind nee,
the deaf hear and the lame und the
crippled, as well as the able bodied,
w alk to the polls and vote for a
change.
The few minutes which are at ray
command do not permit me to go to
any depth of detail. The first year
and a half following the Democratic
victory of 1912 saw the overthrow ot
the protective tariff under which Amer
ica had become- the greatest and rich
est and the most powerful nation on
the face of the earth. Twelve months
of the Underwood tariff law threw a
million American workmen out of their
places and brought many thousand
business men and employers face to
lace w-ith disaster and possible bank
ruptcy. Did the administration at Washing
ton or the Democratic majority in
Congress do anything to correct the er
ror? They did not. Had it been the
first experience of the kind we need
not have been surprised but it was not
the first. It was the fourth. It had
happened once under Martin Van
BuifTt; Democrat. It happened again
under James Buchanan, Democrat. It
occurred once more under Grover
Cleveland, Democrat. Now for a
fourth time the blunder was repeated
while in the w hite house sat Woodrow
Wilson, Democrat.
We learned in childhood that the
leopard cannot change its spots. It
ought by this time to bo equally clear
that the Democratic donkey does not
change its bray. When their revenue
system failed the remedy which the
Democrats applied was the one in
which their party is most expert.
They increased the direct taxes and
spent more money.
The havoc of the Underwood law
was nayed by the outbreak of the war
in Europe. The war held up the grow
ing stream of imports from the low
priced labor markets of the Old World.
But the war brought new and sterner
problems of national honor and nation
al safety. Have these problems been
solved? They have not. For a year
ami three-quarters the United States,
iiu lii'iing the Democratic party, has
had before it the awful lesson of the
greatest war in the history" of the
world and yet not one real stop has
leeu taken to place this country not
on a war basis nut on the only basis
on which a nation can exist in peace
with a reasonable degree of national
security.
God knows, and the rest of us sus
pect that the Republican party has
sometimes failed but It never tallied
and haggled for a year and ten months
in the face of danger without doing
anything to meet the crisis.
Here America stands today, not on a
sound business foundation but de
luded by a gambler's prosperity due to
the temporary demand for munitions
of war Here America stands, in one
hand a white feather held up toward
Mexico and in the other hand a tin
hword pointed at the kaiser.
ITie country needs a change of ad
ministration. It is the duty of this
convention gathered here today to do
its part toward bringing a change so
much to be desired. To do this part
with a patriot's devotion we must lay
aside the jealousy and passion of the
past ami face the future, not merely
with a selfish desire for party victory
but with an earnest determination to
serve our state and country even if it
involves personal saoi ihee and a giv
ing up of our own desire to the -will of
tho party majority.
We have had division m our coun
cils and I hope the day may never
come when we shall not be broad
enough and tolerant enough to dis
agree when we nave Honest titnerences
of opinion, yet at the same time have
sincerity and self sacrifice and patriot
ism enough to lay aside personal pride
uid factional rivalry when our be
loved country is face to face with
humiliation and loss of prestige
Differences we must have but the
hour of danger is not the time or ot
casion for a divided party.
fhe father and mother of a famil
do not always agree' in matters relat
ing to the household. Brothers nnd
sisters considering the same question
do not always arrive at the same eon
elusion. But when the sanctity or
safety of tho home is threatened
father and mother, brothers and sis
ters lav aside all trivial variance and
stand together In defence of the family
honoi'.
A political party Is like a family, rep
resenting many shades oi theory am
conviction, and it should be our priib
as Republicans to tolerate and respect
the earnest belief of those whose juib
niont may not quite agree with ours.
Four years ago the Republican party
split and the result Is that the country
for four years and the government nt
Washington pave been in unskillful
hands and the ship of stale has bee
sailing dose and closer to the rocks of
disaster
Our settled determination today
should be to forget the past, except Its
lessons, and build for the future In
unity, honor and consecrated patriot
ism, and to do that duty this conven
lion w ill now proceed.
