POISON
CRIMES
NEW YORK. May 27.
—Dr. Arthur Warren
\\ aite was found guilty of
first-degree murder today
for killing his father-in
law, John If. Peck, with
poison and germs.
The jury reported at
2:45 p m., after being out
a little over an hour.
Waite will be sentenced to die in
the electric chair at Sing Sinn He
was remanded for sentence Thurs
day.
The convicted murderer received
the verdict calmly.
Two balllffa brought him into the
room, his face firmly set, when the
jurors filed in.
The foreman's words. "Guilty a*
charged.' were scarcely audible.
The Jury was polled while Waite
stood tinfllnchlng. His only sign
of emotion was whea. In reply to
the usual questions regarding Ha
age and birthplace, he apoke so low
it was necessary for a bailiff to re
peat his words
Waite'* father waa overwhelmed
with emotion, weeping wildly.
His other son tried In vain to
comfort him.
Attorney Deuel completed his
dosing argument at 11:45 a. m.
Assistant District Attorney
Itrother* then summed up for the
state.
Asks Life Impriaonment
Deuel reviewed Walte's career
of crime and asked the Jury If ho
could be called sane In view of his
remarkable record
"Even the atate'a alienists said
he was a born criminal," cried
Deuel. "They say he never had
moral sense." 4
Deuel asked for life Imprison
ment In an asylum for Walte.
Walte g.ized at Prosecutor
Brothers steadily as he heard him
self denounced by the state's at
torney as a cruel and cunning mur
derer.
He was similarly unmoved dur
ing Defense Counsel Deuel'a ad
dress.
Declare Him Sane
Three state alienists today de
clared positively they believed
Waite sane when he committed his
crimes, and sane at the present
moment.
They admitted he was not nor
mal and classified him as a "born
criminal."
Deuel, in his closing argument,
seized eagerly on these assertions
and declared the state's experts
reall\ believed Waite deranged.
■luror Trent significantly iskoi
one alienist If he could positively
declare Walte sane in view of his
nonchalant deir.eMnor on the wit
ness stand.
Thaw Reference Stricken
Ridiculing the insanity plea.
Itrothers said: "Is this the kind
of a man you want sent to Mat
teawan. where some bright morn
ing, when the milkman comes
around, he will walk out to free
dom""
The defense objected to thin ref
erence to the Thaw case, and the
remarks were ordered stricken out.
Brothers charged that Walte min
ed Mrs Margaret Horton's life and
lured her away from her husband.
Mrs Walte was In the court
room yesterday when alienists, tes
tifying for her husband, said he
had told them he married her only
for her money
This was In line of their opinion
that he was a "moral imbecile"
and had only an insane knowledge
of right and wrong.
This opinion was offered by Dr.
