10 IS BILLFE?
In An Area of Little More than an
Acre He is Growing 58 Kinds
of Vegetables
V Who is Billee? Billee of the gar
dens, of course. You know him, no
cloubt, but do not know his right
name. It is William Partridge, orig
inally of Illinois and late of Florida.
In an area of a little over an acre,
just north of the' Seaboard depot, he
is successfully growing over 58 dif
fer ' vegetables, many of which
ha v probably never been grown here
before. Moreover Billee is growing
these good things to eat in and out of
season. He is- doing it in an intensive
way, replacing his crops as fast as
they make. Anybody can do the same
thing, he says, by keeping hard at it.
Something of Billee's philosophy
can be gained from the fact that he
says that nut grass is not a pest at
all, and he certainly has a magnificent
crop of it.
"Nut grass don't hurt anything,"
he says. "It holds moisture in the
ground." .
Most any day Billee can be seen
with his little white wagon, peddling
a dozen or more kinds of vegetables.
He now has growing in his garden:
horseradish, rhubarb, strawberries,
parsley, celery, pepers, tomatoes, cu
cumbers, spinach, cabbage, collards,
leek, kale, soup celery, carrots,
radishes, beets, lettuce, sage, cress,
mustard, calous kale, wonder berries,
onions, Swiss chard, oysterplant, egg
plant, peanuts, okra, rape, rudabaga,
Yankee squash, yellow squash,"sweet
potato squash, Pattapan squash,
dasheen, sweet and Irish potatoes,
Brussels sprouts, pimentos, popcorn,
sweet corn, Jackson wonder , beans,
butter beans, romaine, pumpkins,
turnips, kohl rabi, cheviel, chives,
cow peas, cauliflower.; etc.
Billee has been working his pres
ent garden about seven months, and
the seedsmen have had a difficult
time keeping up with him.

DENOUNCES SEIZURES
OF MAIL AS LAWLESS
New Note to Great Britain and France
States that this Country Can no
Longer Tolerate Wrongs
(Associated Press)
Washington, May 27 The United
States in denouncing the interference
with neutral mails has notified Great
Britain and France that it can no
longer tolerate the wrongs which.
American citizens have suffered thru
the "lawless practice" their govern
ments have indulged in.
The note asserts that only a radi
cal change Jn policy-by restoring the
United States to its full legal rights
as a. neutral power will be satisfac
tory. In the text of the note which
was made public last night the time
when the change must be put into ef-
Lfect; is not specified, but President
Wilson expects prompt action.
The note sets forth that not only
have American commercial interests
been injured but rights of property
violated and the rules of international
law and custom palpably disregard
ed. Notice is served that the United
States will soon press claims against
the British and French governments
for losses which have already been
sustained.
The practice of the British and
French of seizing neutral mails and
carrying them to British or French
jurisdiction and there submitting
them to local censorship is spoken of
in the note as. a "serious and vex
atious" abuse.

ments to the postal bill relating to

The senators on the committee were
angry, senator tiardwick asked, "Do
you think " this Congress sits here
solely to listen to little bureau chiefs,
and has no thought, no inteligence,
no convictions or no conscience of its
own? Do you think that because Con
gress doesn't agree with Your recom
mendations and acts on its own in
itiative, you can , slander a senator
because your judgment is not follow
ed?" ; . -. .
Blakslee said he acted purely from
a conviction tnat tne committee act
ed wrongly and against public inter
est. He declared the amendments
gave the railways what they, wanted
arid would . disorganize eight hundred
rural routes with inconvenience to
three hundred thousand citizens.

BERLIN IS LOOKING
FOR PEACE PROPOSALS
Teutons Take Seriously the Rumored
Trip of Colonel House for the
Purpose of Ending War
(Associated Press)
Berlin, May 27. The American
rumors that Col. E. H. House is plan
ning a return trip to Berlin, this time
as a harbinger of peace, or at any
rate to prepare, if possible, founda
tions for peace proposals, is being
taken , seriously here.
It is said that . the situation here
has changed since Col. House's k last
visit, when, no attempt Was made by
him ever to suggest peace.
Apparently Germany would wel
come peace. Arthur Von Gwinner, a
director of the Deutsche bank here,
told an Associated Press representa
tive recently that Germany was like a
poker player who had; won all the,
stakes and naturally was willing to
quit an all-night session.
ITALIANS NOT GIVING IN
Have Lost Very Little Ground in
Comparison with What They
Have Gained
(Associated Press)
. Rome, May 27. The retreat of the
Italians on a portion of the Trentino
front has not caused any pessimism
in official circles here. It is pointed
out that the entire line of battle is
400 miles long and that there need be
no surprise that there should be with
df a wals at some points under over
whelming pressure.
The fact that the Austrians now
hold a small mountainous section of '
Italian territory is considered of small
importance when compared with the
fifteen times greater territory occu
pied by the Italians in Austria. It is
also contended that if the enemy con
tinues to advance the conditions which
have favored him hitherto will be re-'v
versed as the further he gets from
his base of operations the more diffi
cult it will be to supply ammunition
for his heavy artillery. On the other
hand the Italians will enjoy the ad
vantage of having good roads, four
main railways and inexhaustible re-
serves
available at their immediate
rear.
These considerations are independ
ent of the, natural ; obstacles which
make the Austro-Italian front so dif
ferent from that at Verdun. An offi
cial statement has been issued ex
plaining that it is impossible to limit
the war to trench fighting in a region
like the Trentino where large masses
of troops can be easily transferred
from one point to another without
weakening any section of the front.
A Urge number of refugees from
Arsiero, Asiago and neighboring vil
lages have arrived at Milan where
they are being cared for in charitable
institutions. The evacuation of their
home towns was ordered by the Ital
ian military authorities when the
great Austrian offensive started.
