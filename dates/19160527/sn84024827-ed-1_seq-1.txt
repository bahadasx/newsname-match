BERLIN, May 23 (via London May
26.1 Another visit by Col. E. M.
House to Europe would come as no
surprise to initiated quarters there.)
The opinion prevails that he naturally
will come prepared to offer plans for
mediation.
It is hoped here that should Col.
House pay his visit he will come this
time as a harbinger of peace, or at any
rate, to prepare, if possible, the foun
dations for a pence proposal, difficult
as this is recognized to be. During
his last visit to Europe, Col. House
made no effort and conducted no in
vestigations in the direction of peace
in Berlin at any event having per
haps found absolutely adverse condi
tions in capitals of nations hostile to
Germany.

Presumably, also, he had been pro
vided information that American me-,
diariorr was not desired arid it would
not be accepted as long as the United
Srates continues to supply' Germany's"
foe. with cannon, shells, cartridges.
powder and a large amount of other j
munitions tor waging war against tue
central powers.
Moreover, no intimation had been
iriven at the time of this visit that
irascibility in high quarters here on
the munitions question was in any
way abated.
Germany Ready Now
The situation, it may be said, now
has changed. Apparentfy there is no
harm from either a political or a
strategical standpoint, in saying that
Germany would welcome peace.

director of the Deutcbe bank in Ber

( Bv Roview Leasee Wire )
WASHINGTON, May 26 The
United States, denouncing inter
ference with neutral mails, has
told Great Britain and France
that it can 410 longer tolerate the
interference the American citi
zen have suffered and continue to
suffer through the lawless prac
tices those governments have in
dulged in, and that only a radi
cal change in policy, restoring the
United States to its full rights as
a neutral power, would satisfy.
This notification is given in the
latest American Communication to
the two governments, the text of
which was made public by the state
department tonight. The time in
which the change must be effected is
not specified, but the I'nited States
expects prompt action.
"Onerous and vexatious" breaches
of international law which have been
perpetrated by the British and French
governments in seizing and censoring
neutral mail are recited in the com
munication and answers are made to
the legal arguments continued in the
replies of the entente governments to
the nrst American note on the sub-
rights of property have been violate.:
and the rules of international law and
custom palpably disregarded. N'jtice
is served that the United State soon
will ress claims against the British
and French governments for the loss
es which already have been sustained.
Text of Note.
The text of the communication ad
dressed to the British and French am
bassadors to whom it was delivered
said in part:
"Department of Slate. Washington.
May Z4,
"Excellency: I have the bou'jr to
acknowledge receipt of your excel
lency's note of April 3. last, transmit
ting a memorandum dated February
15. 1916. and insubstance ti the Ameri
can ambassador in London "on Febru
ary 17 ia which are stated the con
tentions of the British and French
governments in regard to the right to
detain and examine parcel an dletter
mails enroute by sea between the
United States and Europe."
After discussion of the use t
mails of parcels and letters to be
placed on 'inviolable' list point mem
orandum of FGebruary 15 closes with
the following a3ertions:
Reviews Allies Reply. '
"1 That from the standpoint of the
right of visit and eventual arrival and
seizure merchandise should in post ,
parcels need i.'ol and shall not be
treated otherwise than merchandise
shipped ih any other manner.
That the inviolability of postal
correspondence by the eleventh con
vention of the Hague of 107 t'oes not

of the
! allied governments to visit and if oc
casion arise, arrest and seize mer
chandise hidden in the wrappers, en

Confiscate?
"3 That true j"j their engagements

ence 4he allied governments will con
tinue, for the present, on the high
seas from seizing and confiscating
such correspondence, letters Ur dis
patches and will insure their speed
iest possible transmission as soon as
the sincerity of their character shall
have been ascertained."
It is noted with satisfaction that the
British and French governments do
i.'jt claim, and in the opinion of the
United States government have prop
erly made no claim that the so-called
"blockade" measures are sufficient
guarantees upon which to base a
right to interfere with all classes of
mail matter in transist to or fii the
Central Powers. On the contrary,
their contention appears to be that
genuine correspondence is under con
ventional stipulation "inviolable" mail.
While the government of the United
States agrees that "genuine corres
pondent" mail is inviolable, it does
not admit that belligerents may search
other private seaborne mail for any
jther purpose than to discover wheth
er they contain articles of enemy own
ership carried on belligerent vessels
or articles of contraband transmitted
under sealed covers as letter mail,
though they may intercept at sea all
mails coming out f and going into
ports of the enemy's roasts which are
effectively blockaded. The govern
ment of the I'nited State. Great
Britain and Trance, however, appear
to be I rsubstantial agreement as to
principle. The tnettod of applying
the principle is the chief cause ef
difference.
