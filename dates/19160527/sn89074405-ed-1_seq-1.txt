yesterday before the royal commis
sion which Is investigating the upris
ing.
General Friend, commander of the
British forces'in Ireland at the time
admitted that the number of troops
was small, and that until April
1. he .had been responsible for this
state of affairs, having taken the
ground that he had enough man- to
meet any emergency. Both witnesses
indicated the military authorities had
favored strong measures to suppress
the rebellion but when they heard
of the capture of. Sir Roger Casement
they came to the conclusion that the
rising waa a fiaaoo. It was testified
that Baron Wimborne, the lord lieu
tenant, suggested: on the night before
the rebellion broke out that a raid be
made on liberty hall, the headquar
ters of the „8in Fein society, but it
was decided reinforcements would be
needed for sweh sun-undertaking which
would entail severe, fighting.
Major General Cowall said that if
the outbreak had not occurred mili
tary action certainly would have been
taken within a very brief period.
