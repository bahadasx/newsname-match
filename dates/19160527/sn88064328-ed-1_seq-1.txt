"The Sins of Men"
A Draft Amlpaiit it Hi Evil M m D i .
The Story concerns the writing of a book which
preaches rather daring doctrines, the aatbor of it
being a rather second-rate writer, an old man who
has stambled upon this philosophy and has worked
it ont as a theory, though he freely says that he
does aot believe it.

PREPAREDNESS AGAINST
THE FLY AND DISEASE.

ed most forcibly hy health an
thurifies. The H \ plays a definite
roll in thf transmission of dis
ease. and many of the most ser
ious ills to which the human race
is heir are transmitted through
them. How the transmission of
disease is effected and the means
of combating the pest are matters
whieh should concern the public.
I As the nut I ral enemies of man,
I the fly unquestionably take pre
cedence over all others. Tin; mos
quito may be accorded this posi
tion 11 y some, but if a careful
summary be made of the activities
of both, fi • and mosquito, the
former, we think, will be rated
as the most harmful and dan
gerous.
There are many kind of flies,
hut all of them have not the same
structure, habits, or methods of
reproduction. Tu a way, how
c\er, the families resemble each
other. The most common and
widely distributed of all (lies is
the house fly. This insect is
found in all parts of the world.
Nine-tenths of all flies found
within or near dwellings belong
to tliis srroup as the favorite haunt
of the house fly is the dwelling
of man. \
Flies are very proliu", and tli™
stages in the life circle o-cupy
but a few days. As the eggs de
posited by the female usually
nunber a hundred or more, an
enormous increase in population
is possible within a very short
period of time. The house fly
breeds in organic filth. A fav
orite medium is horse manure,
hut decaying vegetables, ferment
iu£ HtcWfl W WV l 'fff.H
and pi trifyinj animal matter
offer sites which are nearly as
well adapted to the conditions
necessary for propagation. The
barn manure pile may be the
place of origin of thousands of
dies, the unprotected and un
screened privy ser\rs as an ex
cellent location for their growth,
while fermenting foodstuffs and
other waste food products scat
tered about the yard may also
assist in their propagation. Three
requisites are necessary however,
namely, proper temperature,
moisture, and food supply. The
warm manure pile and the decay
ing and fermenting garbage heap
admirably fulfill these conditions.
The swarm of tljcs invariably seen
about such places during the sum
mer season is an indication that
feeding and propagation is in
process.
The habits of the fly made it
the most objectionable insect with
which man comes in contact It
not only breeds in filth but it con
tinues to frequent objectionable
material throughout the days of
its existence, leaving it only to in
vade homes to contaminate food
and to spread disease. Heilig per
sistent feeders, they are very in
dustrious in tl^eir search for food
Even when food is right at hand
they will crawl over the entire
surface looking for the most
dainty morsels. On their excur
sions of this character, they may
carry with them, particularly on
the hairy parts of their legs, the
organisms of infectious disease,
the eggs of various parasites, and
organic filth. Another manner by
which infection is disseminated is
through the regurgitation or vom
iting of food. It is surely un
Rebel tai PahMMrjr
largely on the sufferer'* abil
ity to upbuild a weakened system, and
thus hasten a return of normal body
functions.
In this effort much depends on fresh
air— nicht and day—and rest and good
food. The patient should refrain from
work that overtaies. and all sanitary
precaution« should bo taken. These
common sense measures do not always
achieve the desired results unless aid*
ed by proper medication.
It Is here that Bckman's Alterative
has evidenced Its worth, for In many
caoss It has effected lasting benefit

This disease is an acute, infec

system the bacteria containing

\
Tlie most si ccessful mefhod of
ridding a community of flies is to
institute a continued çamnaign
for that purpose. It is only by
the unfted efforts of us h 11 that
fly eradication is possible. The
natural-enemies of the lly, are feW

united efforts must we rely for
results that count. And the t ; iii"
oT the year to make these efforts
is now. Ordinarily fly-eradica

late in the season to be effective
