WASHINGTON. May 2 ti. The
United States. denouncing In-
terferenre with nrutral mails, has no
titled Great Britain and France that
it can no longer tolerate the wrongs
which American citizens have suf
fcred and continue to suffer through
the "lawless practice" those govern
ments have Indulged in and that only
a radical change in policy restoring
the United States to its full rights as
a neutral power will be satisfactory.
This notification is given In the latest
American communication to the two
governments, the text or which was
made public by the state department
tonight. The time in which the
change must lie effected is not speci
fied but the United Slates expects
prompt action,
, Will Tress Claims.
Notice' Is served that the United
States soon will press claims against
the British and French governments
for the losses which already have
been sustained.
The text o the communication, ad
dressed to the lirilish and French am
bassadors to whom it was delivered
Wednesday, follows:
"I have the honor to acknowledge
receipt of your excellency's note of
April 3 last In which are stated the
contentions of the Rritish and
French government in regard to the
right to detain and examine parcel
and letter malls en route by sea be
tween the United Slates and Kurope.
"After a discussion of the use of
the mails for the transmission of par
cels and of the limitations to be
placed on 'inviolable mail" the joint
memorandum of February 15 closes
with the following assertions:
May Seize Malls.
"I That from the standpoint of
the right of visitation and eventual

"3. That through their engage
ments and respect for genuine 'cor

IHt'lurcs Villa Was Prompted by Mo
tives of Iovotiii to Ills Own
Country.
CHIHUAHUA CITY, Mexico, May
I'fi. (liy Courier to El Paso. May 26.)
Squatting in a corner of his cell in the
Chihuahua penitentiary, I'ablo Lopez,
the captured Villa bandit, today gave
the Associated Press correspondent
the Villista explanation of the two
culminating crimes of Francisco Vil
la's career the Santa Ysabel massa
cre and the Columbus raid.
Ixipcz was the bandit's closest
henchman, his chief lieutenant and
his prime aide and executioner In
both affairs.
Sitting in the shadow of approach
ing death, for I'ablo is to be executed
just as soon as his wounds are healed,
the bandit declared that in killing
eighteen Americans at Santa Ysabel
last January, he only obeyed Villa's
orders, lopez asserted that "Don
I'aneho's" motive both at Santa
Ysabel and Columbus was revenge
mixed with a desire to waken his
country to the danger of "gringo
domination.
"I ion l'ancho," he said, "was con
vinced that the United States was too
cowardly to try to win .Mexico by
arms and believed that it 'would keep
pitting one faction against another un
til we were all killed off when our
exhausted country would fall like a
ripe pear into their eager hands."
At times nlso l.opez said Villa
would charge Ciirranza with "selling
out to the grlngoes." On such occa
sions he said Villa would assert that
he must try for Intervention before
"the Americans were ready" and
"while we still had time to become a
united nation."

CALL A CONVENTION

Platform
and
Candidates
Next Month.
With thirty members present, most
of them from the rural district?!, the
county central committee of tke Re
publican party in Tulsa county held
a special meeting III Tulsa yesterday
afternoon. They went on record
against a preferential primary, but
decided to hold a lonvcntion some
lime in June, at which time the plat
form for the coming county cam
paign will be adoplcd and candidates
and prospective candidates will ho In
trodiii ed.
A committee, consisting of County
Chairman A. A. Small and Messrs.
Houser of Broken Arrow and Town
send of SklatooU, was appointed for
the purpose of setting the date and
arranging for the convention. Repre.
sentation In the convention will be al
lowed on the lias's of ono delegate
to every ten otcs.
i. O. 1 lias Majority.
It was announced Hit as a result
of th united efforts of the Republi
can organization during the recent
registration period a total of eleven
thousand voters were registered in the
county. This is twice the number of
votes 'cast In the election two years
ago. The increase In the city of Tulsa
is phenomenal. Tho statement by
Chairman Small that nearly six thous
and of the eleven thousand voters
regtstere.1 wrre Republicans, aroused
great enthusiasm. Committeemen
from eveiv section nf the county re
ported widespread Interest in the com
ing campaign and an almost universal
desire for a chango In officials. The
committee decided unanimously to put
out a full ticket. There will be clean,
strong candidates from every portion
of the rountv.
It was decided to keep Republican
headquarters In tho Robinson Arcade
open until after tho election In Novem
ber. Two large rooms have been ntten
up and telephones Installed.
At the convention In Juno some
speaker of national reputation will ad
dress tho Republicans of the county.
Big I'rimary Vote.
Several members yesterday spoke of
the necessity of getting out a heavy
vote at the primary In August, for the
purpose of knocking out the 12 or
more proposed constitutional amend
ments, including the new literacy test
law, put up by tho Democratic party
as a substitute for the late lamented
"grandfather clause." Speakers also
urged that the county cast a unani
mous vote against the vitallzation of
Campbell Russell's section 12-A of
tho constitution. If this amendment
should be vitalized it will lako JKO.0110
away from the schools of Tulsa county
annually, as It provides for tho distri
bution of all school tax by the stato,
on the basis of school population.
Chairman A. A. So all made the
keynote speech of tho coming cam
paign. "We arc in this battle to win," he
declared. Victory or defeat rests
with this committee. We can and
must win: not to punish, not to find
fault with anyone, nor to unearth
crookedness, but on account of the
bad management we have had. to get
ofieers who will give tho people a
business administration in out county
affairs.
"We must win," he continued. "The
eyes of Oklahoma are on Tulsa coun
ty. This county, more than any oth
er county In the state, is making the
history of Oklahoma. The city elec
tion here placed the city administra
tion in the hands of the Republicans,
and the peope are saying, 'will the
Republicans make good?' And now,
holding the strategic location In this
state, it Is our duty, as the generals
In this campaign, to sec to it that the
proper methods are employed, the
proper ticket put forward and voters
given tho opportunity of putting clean
business men in every orriee In tne
I county and assist in redeeming the
4 i state of Oklahoma."

LISRON. Portugal, April 1K.--AI-though
the origin of the fire which
destroyed the naval arsenal in Lisbon
on April l'J is still undetermined. It
Is said that the fire was foretold sev
eral weeks before It occurred In a
warning letter to tho government,
supposedly from Germans, threaten
ing a long series of reprisals If Portu
gal persists in participation In the
war. It Is also reported that the
minister of war. Major Norton de
Matins, has been threatened with
death If he persisted In the inquiry
us to the origin of the arsenal fire or
uiiv similar disasters.
The burning of the arsenal was co
incident with the sinking of the Nor
wegian steamship TerJo Vlken as
was briefly report-;! by cable. The
vessel has on hoard (if.. 000 tons of
wheat from America. Her sinking In
Oascae bay, fifteen miles west of Lis
bon, is the first indication of German
submarine activity along the Portu
guese coast. Advices had been re
ceived previously from London that
a German submarine attack against
the Portuguese ciust might lie at
tempted and Captain Leotin de Rego,
commander of the Port uguese naval
division unohoreo in the Tagus, recent
ly learned of the presence of two
German Mibmurlncs which are sup
posed to have scattered mines In the
neighborhood of the bur. It does
not appear to lie established whether
the sinking of the TcrJ- Viken was
due to a mine or torpedo, but It Is
believed that It was due to the lat
ter The vessel was three and a half
miles Irom the ISar, when three ex
plosions oeelirrcd, anu the vessel sank
within hnlf an hour. There was Just
time for the twenty-seven men aboard
to get away safely.
The loss in the burning of the na
vui ar.ienal is Important, not only be
cause the arsenal buildings were some
of the finest of the new Lisbon, but
the naval museum there contained a
wonderful collection of models of
ships, ancient caravels and modern
vessels of all types. The banqueting
hall In connection with the naval
school, which was also destroyed, was
one of the sights of Lisbon, being of

previous information that American
mediation would not be nccepted so
long as the United States continued to
supply Germany's foes with munitions.
Situation Changed.
The situation, It may bo said, now
has changed. Apparently there is no
harm from either u polltioal or a
strategical standpoint in saying that
Germany would welcome peace. As
Arthur von Gwinner, the managing
director of the Deutsche bank In
Rerlln, stated to the Associated Press
correspondent recently, Germany is
in the position of a poker player who
has gathered III all the money on tho
table und naturally Is willing to break
off an ullniglit session and retire with
his winnings while the others persist
in continuing in tho hopo of recouping
some of their losses.
The cards, however, to continue the
simile, nre running strongly in the
Germans' favor, It is pointed out us
shown in the renewed postponement
of the long heralded Anglo-French
offensive In the west, the steady
though slow progress at Verdun, the
victories of the Turks and finally the
crushing resultes of the Austrian of
fensive in the Trentlno.
Will Allies Aii-opt?
Whether these events are enough
to Induce the entente allies to retire
from what Is looked upon here as a
losing game and whether the changed
tone of the utterances of Premier As
quilh and Sir Edward Grey und what
is considered a disavowal of their In
tention to crush Germany as a nation
and a conm "rcbil rival or dismember
the empire ore indicative of receptiv
ity toward reasonable peace propos
als, is an uncertain factor In the
reckoning.
The best posted neutral observers
here, particularly diplomats in touch
with the sentiment in both camps are
Inclined to rive a negative answer to
these questions and to hold that
something further must occur to con
vince the entente allies that the ex
pulsion of the German nrmies from
occupied territories and the comple
tion of the "on to Merlin" cam
paign are Impossibilities even with
