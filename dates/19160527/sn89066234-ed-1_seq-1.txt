Counties that are Near.
There are signs on nil iMm that
the light is breaking In on even
the most petrified minds. What
are we to think when SO ortho-

HUlaboro is a little county seat
town or Jefferson county with a
population similar to Benton, it
had a bank which, according to
news reports, had a capital stock
or 85,000 and deposits amounting
to $120,000. In other words, ror
every -4 that a depositor put
in the bank there was one dollar
,r security In capital stock put
mi by the promoters, Vet we
are told that the banking system
is safe, The only reason there
are not more bank failures is be
cause the graft Is so great that
there is more profit In continu
ing, it takes a great deal or
newspaper advertising about
"safety to net people to put
their money In so flimsy an insti
tution as the banking system.
Every day we read of hank raii
n I es. but you never rind the news
papers telling you that it Is the
Tault r the system. The Hlllsbo
ro bank failed and. as usual, tin"
cashier was made "the goat.'' He
was sentenced to the pen lor
three years for accepting depos
its when he knew the bank was
on its last legs. What good Will
u do those who lost their money
to send this hired man to the pen .'
The Catholic Union held a three
days session at the Cape last
week. Since we are assured that
"the church" and these societies
are purely religious and have no
political significance. I watched
the papers carefully to see what
resolutions might be passed. Tie1
constitution was revised, so the
papers said, and resolutions were
adopted but nothing was pub
lished. However, the Tribune as
sures us that In their resolutions
the delegates made a Hat de
claration of patriotism and loy
alty to the United States. The
Kicker would like to know why a
purely religious body rinds it nec
essary to decline its patriotism
and loyalty to the POLITICAL
Stat ? Th:' political state is cap
italistic. At New Hamburg, only
a few days before, they denounc
ed both capitalism and Socialism
Ain't they getting their wires
crossed?
Campbell Citizen. While grad
ing on the Glennonville road last
Thursday Sam Hopper's bin trac
tion engine went 'through the
bridge across the slough near
Henry Skldmore's. The middle
pier gave way and the engine
plunged into the water, the cab
being nearly submerged .John
Flowers, the engineer, stayed
with the throttle and had to
swim out. It is a wonder lie dh!
not get hurt. Hopper and Flow
ers took a stump puller and turn
ed the engine right side up, Satur
day, and discovered it was dam
aged p.bout $100. the fly wheel,
governors and cab being damag
ed badly. The bridge was com
pletely demolished.
Rloom field Vindicator Harry
Richmond, the seventeen year old
son or E W. Riehmonds. or Ad
vance, was round dead by his
companions in the woods east of
Advenes Saturday after he had
been gone from them for several
aours. They were all together
hunting near Perkins, and Harry
Richmond had gone off alone
with his gun. Late that evening
when he had not returned a
seal eh was Instituted, resulting
in the discovery of his dead body.
A small gunshot wound in his face
was the only mark upon him.
His death remains a mystery,
but it is generally attributed to
the accidental discharge of his
own gun.
It Is evident that somebody has
done gone and "seen" the Oran
Tribune man. Week before last
his paper contained a very strong
ai tide opposing the re-employing
of the farm adviser. Last week
he reversed his engines and. with
out explaining what it was that
caused his change of heart, pub
lished JuRt as strong an article In
favor of It. Usually, when an edi
tor changes his "opinion" over
night, he offers some sort of an
apoiog. or explanation for it
Not so with the Oran editor.

J.idg" Kelly rendered a decision
at Jackson Inst week that seems
to hiv? no precedent. The case
was n result of ttie saloon war at
Allenvllle three years ago. when
Mrs Dr. Marked had :icorge R.
Wilson, the banker, arrested for
disturbing her peace, The case
was disposed or a couple or
weeks ago when Mr. Wilson was
fined one dollar. But the costs
had mounted to several hundred
dollars and the attorneys for the
banker moved to re-tax costs
Kelly took the matter 'under ad
vlsement." and then assessed
(1200 or the costs against Mrs
Marked. S102 against the state
and the balance against the
I inker. The state was the plain
tiff in the case; Mrs. Marked was
only a state's witness, ami the
banker was round guilty; Evei

Kelly have ruled that way iT th
defendant had been a working-
man? The matter w as appealed

Pemiscot Argus. a destructive
hailstorm struck some portions ol
Pemiscot county May IB, causing
considerable damage. On th"
Tobe" Balrd farm, three miles
north or Caruthersville, the hail
storm was very heavy, ruining
about two hundred acres of
young cotton. Inviting the alfalfn
til it was as if a mower had run
over it, knocking the fruit from
th trees and breaking many
window panes. It is hard to

Fast Prarts Eagle. We receive
each week letters, pamphlets and
reprint stuff from various candi
dates for state offices who ask
us to "please print so your read
ers may be Informed as to our
qualifications," but they do not
enclose any piece of paper resem
bling a check, and but few of
them enclose a dollar for sub
scription to the paper, Though
they have no hesitancy in asking
that a marked copy of the pane;
containing th? article be sent
them. If nerve and gall were
qualifications for office, Missouri
could pick a splendid set of offi
cials. When it comes to fiction, the
Cape Tribune seems to have a
jwlice reporter" who is a sur
vivor of the days of the James
and Younger boys. An officer
killed a negro at I II mo last week
and the Jimplicute told the facts
in about Bo lines. The Tribune
used up three columns mostly
hot air. But it was a wierd
story all right.

1 THIS "FREE" COUNTRY
Whether In a republic, a mon
achy or a despotism, the things
that the ruling powers fear most
are publicity and education For
this reason they seek to destroy
all avenues of publicity and edu
cation they cannot control
In any country the chief sour
ces of publicity and education are
the press, the pulpit and schools
While it is becoming pretty gen
erally understood that the press
and pulpit serve the master class,
it is not so well known that the
colleges and universities are sim
ilarly tainted The "regents" of
these schools, which are similar
to our directors In the country,
are all of the very wealthy, and
are appointed not elected
Prof. Scott Nearing is one of
th ablest of teachers of today
And he lias a world of trouble In
satisfying the plutcs who control
the higher schools He believes in
teaching the truth to the young
For this very grave offense he
was dismissed from the Universi
ty of Pennsylvania. But the Uni
versity of Toleda, Ohio, jumped
it the opportunity to get him
Toledo is. perhaps, the most ad
vanced city In America. At the
head of its government it has had
such radicals as "fJol i"n Rule''
Jones and Brand Whltlock
But Prof. Nearing is In trouble
again H" has offended a shoo
fly organization that wraps it
self In the riag and calls itseir the
Sons of the American Revolution
Th9' want him removed from the
faculty of the University of To
ledo because he has criticised the
parrot-like repeating by public
school children of a bombastic
Oath of allegiance to the United
States, and because he is reported
to have said that "the flag be
longs to the capitalists." Says
the Milwaukee Leader:
"It is safe to say that Nearing
might have denounced the flag
to his heart's content if he had
not also denounced low wages
When James Maurer was falsely
accused or saying, "to hell with
the Hag" there was a roar of in
dignation and demands that he be
punished,
"When it was discovered that
Maurer was only quoting a mem
ber of the Pennsylvania consta
bulary no one even suggested
that the guilty one be disciplined
It is the business of the constabu
lary to beat down wages anil
beat up worktngmen. if, In so
doing, they find it necessary to
"cuss out" the flag, then such de
nunciation is praiseworthy.
"Nearing would make this coun
try one that every citizen would
wish to defend, His enemies
would maintain it as an instru
ment of oppression In the hands
of a small class of , ..rs.
"Nearing points to greed and
robbery hiding behind the flag In
order to drive them out and re
store that flag to all the people.
The Sons of the American Revolu
tion would cover up that greed
and robbery with the flag in or
der to continue the robbery."
INVITING.
The warden of the penitentiary
has just completed the finest cell
building in the United States. It
has every modern convenience, is
sanitary and roomy. Factory
editorial in Caruthersville Demo
crat
That is inviting Let's all go
to the penitentiary. No working
man outside of tho penitentiary
can boast of "every modern con
venience" and of quarters "sani
tary and roomy." He usually
lives in a hoard shack If he can
pay the rent.
SECURITY AND STABILITY
The orators and newspapers of
the ruling class tell us a great
deal about the stability of our
government and the security of
your life, liberty and property,
We have had this preached to us
until We really believe It.
Stable means permanent, secure.
If wo have such a stable govern
ment, why is it necessary to
Spend hundreds of millions of dol
lars annually to support an army
that lias never lecn used Tor any
other purpose than to shoot down
Working men and women who
may protest against the tyranny
of Dollar Rule? Can you point
out a single instance where the
army or navy has lieen used for
any other purpose than to pro
tect Dollars. I challenge anyone
to show where the military force
has been used otherwise since the
rebellion of '61.
As to the protection or life and
liberty, that all depends on who
you are. IT you have the price
you can buy both. But iT you
happen to be poor, and especially
U you oppose the ruling class, the
constitutional guarantee oT life
and liberty is a Joke. Hundreds
or men ami women have leen jail
ed and are today in prison ror no
other reason than that they
thought they had the right to
express them selves in speech and
print. And I could mention quite
u number who have been put to
death Tor the same reason In
this "free" country.
As for the security of property,
even the defenders of the present
order are aware that there
cnly a flimsy pretense of securl
ty. And there is no peace of mind
for those who have the property.
The cutest and slickest of them
get caught. If you sit dow n to a
game of seven-up or euchre you
know the rules, and the game is
open and above-board, But when
you sit in the game of profits the
game is secret, the rules are
many and conflicting, except the
basic rule that the longest pole
knocks the persimmon, or tint
might makes right.
It is Impossible that any kind of
government can protect conflict
ing interests with equal Justice
It must either favor the skinner
or the skinned. An 1 there can bo
no peace so long a the skin gams
is tolerated.
Hence the thing to do is to
change the game so that there
will be no conflicting Interests
each for all and all for each. And
that is nothing more than pure
Democracy for which so many of
our statesmen pretend to stand
or Republicanism as advocated by
its founder Lincoln.
You may hear co-called Demo
cratic orators yawp about the
"time honored principles of Thom
as Jefferson." You may hear Re
publican spell-binders spout off
about Abe Lincoln. But you will
never hear either of them quoted
on the relations of capital and la
bor. And that is the issue the
only real issue before the peo
ple of this or any other country
today. And the chief job of the
politicians and their organs is to
hide the issue. How long can
they do it?
Lincoln said "Labor is prior to
capital" and is. therefore, entitled
to the greater consideration by
government. In other words, la
bor creates capital and should be
the master. Jefferson held tin
same ideas. But none of their al
leged followers do.
These alleged followers of Jeff
erson and Lincoln will tell you
that the interests of capital and
labor are identical, and that har
mony should prevail. It would l)e
as easy to create harmony be
tween two dogs fighting over a
bone. According to brute law
the bone goes to the dog that is
able to take it. That is also capi
talist law stripped of all its trap
pings and hypocritical pretenses.
Take a peep at Europe and set
capitalist law in its hideous nak
edness. PLEASURE IN WORK.
From the Milwaukee Loader.
It is not exertion of the muscles
that makes work painful. Watch
a foot-ball game or a four mile
boat race if you doubt it.
A chess tournament will prove
that nervous exhaustion does not
necessarily come from hard think
ing Muscle and brain both revolt at
doing work that is not directed
by the will of the person working
When WS do what we wish, we
call it play, and it rests us. When
we do what we are forced to do,
it is work, and it tires us.
The essential difference between
work and play between painful
and pleasurable exertion is found
In the question of whether the
muscles and mind are doing
tilings that are planned by their
possessor.
Give the worker a chance to de
cide on the work to be done, and
how it is to be done, and then
make sure that the product will
go to those who do the work, and
we will have made all work play
This Is something that comes
Inevitably from the common own
ership and direction of indurtry
by a democracy of labor. Just
now It sounds fantastic as fan
tastic as an aeroplane 20 years
ago, or a public school a couple
of centuries ago.
People will believe in a Golden
Age before there is even a tradi
tion to describe it; and in all
kinds of paradises beyond life, but
they sneer at the possibility of a
society on earth where those who
work shall say what the work
shall be and shall enjoy the product.

THE FARM ADVISER,
Judging from last weeks county
papers, there must be considera
ble stir over the reemployment
Of the COUnty farm adviser Those
papers that had not already ox
pressed themselves favorable to
reemployment, wen- made to do
so last week, with two exceptions
a prepared article a column in
length, appeared in these papers
ill al'ik". word for word The
article was not signed, nor was
it marked "advertisement." The
reader was to be lert under the
Impression that it was the opin
ion cif the editor on the necessity
of retaining the farm adviser.
Those editors who, like the Kick
er man. are scarcely able to dis
tinguish between a cabbage plant
and n goose-berry bush could
tell the farmer all about It If
someone else prepared the copy.
Since the matter la to be passed
upon next Thursday, we may ex
pect another press bombardment
this week,
Whether or not a farm adviser
is worth w hile under the condi
tions in seott county I do not
know. Nor is there any question
as ti the ability or Mr Deer, ib
is probably as useful as most oth
er men on the public pay. roll,
Which I think We would he better
off If we dispensed with about
rour-rifths, and reduce the pay ol
tic remaining one-fifth about
one-half
All the Kicker did was to tell
the people What was going on
None of the other paper would
tell it. Borne of them did
not know, l hid heard of the ef
forts to "drum Up 1 crowd" be
fore the county court, but paid
no attention to It It was the
evident Intention of the promo
ters to slip up on the blind side
of the court and "put it over" be
fore any opposition could develop
But the court scented some
thing and hesitated Then the
Kicker told the story And now
there is pro ho inct-l opposition.
From what I have learned since,
it is my opinion tint not one in
ten or the men w ho work the soil
care anything about the farm ad
viser, But the opposition i dis
organised, and the opposition of a
disorganised body amounts to
little
And I repeat that If the men be
hind the reemployment of the
farm advisor don't get what thej
want, it will be the first time
tle-y have been turned down
When the landlord, the priest and
the politicians want something,

It would be foolish to single out
the Methodist church for criti
cism In this connection. There
are few churches where as large
a vote for ui.ion labor could have
been obtained in a general gov
erning body. Not eo many years
ago it would have been impossible
to have even Introduced a resolu
tlon In favor of organized labor
This editorial is not a denuncia
tlon of religion. It is only an ex
planatlon of one of the reasons

church.

RAILROAD POVERTY
Fri in the Milwaukee Leader,
it is always most embarrass
ing when ,vou are explaining to
the tax collector that you are
continuing your business only is
I charity to the public to have
your bookkeeper come In and con
gratulate w.u on your unpreced
ented profits That is exactly
what is happening to the rail
roads. '
Just ns the railroad publicity
agents have Finished explaining
that to reduce the hours of their
employes Would positively bank
rupt every road In th- country
and compel a great increase in
rates, the Bureau of Railway E
conomlcs of the federal govern
ment hands out a statement that
threatens to spoil the whole
game According to this state
II ent, which is made up from th
Official reports of the roads, the
revenues of the American rail
("ids In the eight months ending
Much 1 shows a gain of n per
cent in operating income and an
Increase f less than one-half or

1 onmienting on the prospect
ror the remainder of the year,
the bureau heartlessly remarks:
li' this rate or business keen mi
th" railronds Will make 11 total
et profit of more than S7'.'l.-
noo.ooo."
ow as the wildest estimate ,,f
th'- cost of the Increased wages
and shorter hours is only !J0.-
000.000 and since no one except
tno most expert railroad statisti
cians liehcve that it Will cost
more than one-hair this sum. it
would aeem that there would be
several pennies between the wide
and bankruptcy if the unions get
what they are asking for

lor several weeks the pr es. h-t
been subjected to s regular "cur
tain of fire" in the form of ready
made railroad editorials All the
papers that dance to railroad
music have been trying these edi
torials on their readers,
Now the Association of Western
Railways compile, .some 150 of
these machine-made editorials
Into a pamphlet and sends it out
to the press to show that "public
opinion'' i. opposed to the eight
hour day,
s might tx- expected from such
1 standardised product there is
in icn sameness In the output.
Nearly all quote the same figures
to show the poverty of the rail
roads all weep for the dear pub
lic" and threaten that Increased
wages w-;il mean increased rates.
Financial America and The
Railway g" Oasette rise t 1
suspiciously similar level ol indig
nation Tie- first is frightened at
the possibility or a strike w rule
the European war continues and
warns the railroad workers that
"treasonable opportunism is an
appropriate term for such an at
titude." The Oasette pictures a
1 islble war with Mexico and
conclude! "This would b- a
mighty poor- time for a strike;
and to call it under such condi
tions would be little short of
ti eason "
The Chloago Herald holds out
the frightful prospect that "Cap
ital may refuse to work ror wag
es deemed Inadequate Labor has
no monopoly of the strike " The
horrible possibility or all thr- cap
italists ir. the country taking
their capital and going orr into
the garden to eat worms while
th- people suffer Is too terrible
to contemplate
The Chicago Tribune and The
Iron Tradesman drag out the
threat of government ownership,
if the engine and trainmen
should win their point it would be
but another step toward a gen
eral breakdown, and that would
mean eventually government
ownership," say. The Tradesman,
Th Tribune goes a step farther
and tells the prospective striker s ;
"Government ownership of the
railroads will take away from
the employ es the right to strike."
But the domlnent note or the
whole chorus, is that the Door
public is about to suffer- This is
probably true, Most of the -pub
lic" are members of the working
class and they are continually
soaked lor- all that the traffla
will bear, Therefore they should
not worry much about anything
more the railroads can do to
them

Ituring the past half a century
they have grabbed everything
loose, and plenty of things that
were supposed to be locked up
and ns41ed down.
If the workers in other lines of
Industry can get the wealth they
are producing and that is taken
away from them by their em
ployers they need not be disturb
ed at the threats to raise rates.
The attention of those who
compiled tho pumphlet of editor
ials should be called to the fact
that they did not include any
quotations from The Leader.
