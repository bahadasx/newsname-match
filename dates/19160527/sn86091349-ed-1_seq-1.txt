Con. Nevada-Utah
Gives
After the break-down last week,
which necessitated the stopping of
work for four days, the Consolidat
ed Nevada-Utah mill has been grind
ing away steadily all af this week
and doing better work than at any
time since the plant was placed in
commission. This has been accom
plished after making some altera
tions, which is usually the case
when new machinery is being tried
out and properly tuned up.
The mill has been taking care of
from 55 to 60 tons of ore per day;
the grade of zinc concentrate being
turned out is good, carrying silver
values of a much better grade
than was anticipated. The iron-lead
concentrate is not so desirable ow
ing to the presence of a considera
ble quantity of zinc; but the amount
in the latter Is gradually being in
duced and made less objectionable
It is a matter of only a little while
until metallurgy will solve this prob
lem effectively.
At the present time from 29 to
2fi tons per day of ore is goin.; di
rect from the mine to the mill;
the balance coming from the
mill, the balance '.otning froir. the
stock pile on the dump which was
accumulated during the lis nil sort
ing days. Only one shift of men
Is working in the miae now and ev
ery thing has been bi ought down to

Two cars of cpnceutrate will be

ONE HUNDRED SHEEP
'DIE FROM THE RABIES
Joe Enos, who is running a band
of about 4,000 head of sheep in the
hills east of Stillwater, informed
Charlie Kent yesterday that rabies
had broken out in the herd and up
wards of a hundred head have died
within the past few days. About a
month ago a eoyote appeared in the
herd one night and bit quite a num
ber of the animals and attacked the
dogs. Until last week nothing oc
curred to indicate the presence of
rabies when suddenly the animals de
veloped the malady and have since
been dying at a rapid rate. In one
day he was compelled to kill seven

UVADA COPPER MINE
MANAGER IX CAMP
M. M. Johnson, mine manager of
the Uvada Copper company, operat
ing at Bristol, was in camp a couple
of days this week and made a hur
ried, trip to the mine; which he de
clares, is looking fine and is making
money. Work has been handicapped
a great deal on account of the pres

WILL DRILL FOR WATER
IN WHITE RIVER VALLEY
At the adjourned meeting of the
board of county commissioners held
Monday last it was decided . to con
tinue drilling for water with the
county's drilling plant at the site se
lected by the board a year ago, which
is only a few miles distant from the
town of Preston in White Hiver val
ley. The work will be commenced
just as soon as a competent man can
be secured to take charge of the drill
ing plant. The county had prct'y bad
luck in Its operations ast year, which
was generally supposed to be due to
the lack of experience on. the part of
the operator. Ely Record.
WILL INSTALL FLOTATION
PROCESS AT CHERRY CREEK
Downer brothers of Goldfleld, have
recently taken over the dump at the
Star mine, north of Cherry Creek,
and are peparing to install the nota
tion process to work the tailings. This
experiment , will be watched with
great interest by all mine, operators
In the district. Should it prove suc
cessful, It will no doubt be takeii up
by the Star company for the- future
reduction of its vast bodies of ore.
Manager Fletcher is moving a tas-
toline engine and compressor down
from the upper workings and opera
tions will be resumed right away.

The following, from the Tonopah
Times, will be of local interest:
"Mrs. T. J. Lynch yesterday re
ceived a wire from Oakland announc
ing the death of her father,' T. E.
Edwards. The deceased, who was
well known In Tonopah, received In
juries in a runaway accident near
St. Helena last Sunday that result

Mr. Edwards, who was about 58
years of age, was one of the pioneer
merchants of Tonopah. His mining
ventures in southern Nevada had
brought him a fortune,, a large part
of which he invested In coast prop
erties. Mrs. Lynch departed for the

The deceased formerly resided In
Lincoln county, having conducted a
mercantile business at Delamar for
a number of years. He left Delamar
to go to Tonopah shortly after the
discovery of that camp by Jim But

Railroad Company
Changes Official Name
The San Pedro, Los Angeles &
Salt Lake ralroad is to be renamed
in honor of one of the two most im
portant cities on the line. By the
management it has been officially des
ignated as the "Salt Lake Route."
For years past the road has been
designated as the "Salt Lake Route"
by the passenger traffic department,
and it was at the suggestion of T. C.
Peck, general passenger agent, that
the name has been adopted by the
management of the road. The old
name is to be dropped entirely and
"Salt Lake Route" is to appear at
the head of all company stationery.
By many persons, particularly
throughout the east, the road is gen
erally known as the "San Pedro."
Traffic offlcals argue that San Pedro
is Vse of the smaller towns on the
line, therefore, the name, as applied
to the road, is Insignificant, while
Salt Lake is one of the two most
important towns, the eastern termi
nus of the line, and the town en
titled to such recognition and the
publicity that naturally would fol
low. Anyway, "Salt Lake" is far
more distinctive.
Then there is another reason for
the change in name, in which the
traffic department Is vitally inter
ested. In the east the ticket and
The Ninth Annual Convocation of
the Missionary District of Kev.tda
met in Elko, May 12, 13 and 14. At
the first service the bishop rei.d his
annual address, reviewing the work
of the past year. On the whole Hie
report indicated there had been prog
ress la every direction and there is
the promise of a steady advance in
the coming year.
Among his other recommendations
Bishop Hunting said that he thought
the time had come for some definite
step by the christian people of Ne
vada in the direction of a bettering
of moral conditions by regulation of
the, liquor traffic, as well as by a
more carefully drawn divorce statute.
For himself he thought that the
church people of Nevada, especially
the 'clergy, should put themselves
back of an attempt to place these two
questions before the voters o! Ne
vada at the next general election, by
means of an initiative petition. He
favored state-wide prohibition of the
liquor traffic and a divorce statute
which wll provide for an Interlocu
tory decree.
The convocation placed itself
squarely back of the bishop in this
RELATING TO THE SALE
OF TUNGSTEN ORES
For convenience in selling tung
sten ores, prices are quoted per unit,
a unit being' 20 pounds, or 1 per
cent of a ton. Accordingly 60 per
cent concentrates are supposed to
yield 12 pounds of tungstlc acid per
unit, or 1200 pounds to the ton, ac
cording to the Denver - Mining Rec
ord. If a price of $60 per unit is
quoted for 60 per cent concentrates
and the yield when refined is 70
per cent, the mine receives $60 for
each per cent, or 20 pounds of tung
stlc acid in the shipment, or $4200
for the ton.
Previous to the war 60 per cent
tungsten concentrates sold below $9
a unit. Since the war, and especial
ly since the embargo, prices have
advanced rapidly and fluctuated con
siderably. Such concentrates have
sold for 1 110 a unit, while a fair
average for the past few mo tths i
$65 Ferro-tungsten, whlc'a is be
tween. 9 6 and 98 per cent pure, is
retailing between $8 and f 10 a lb.

billing clerks are in pretty much of
a rush all the time. San Pedro, Los
Angeles & Salt Lake, requires quite
'a few strokes of the pen and the
clerks are inclined to take all the
short cuts possible. One of the best
known short cuts is to use initials
Instead of names, as frequently as
possible. S. P., L. A. & S. L. makes
rather an awkward bunch of letters
to string out with a pen that is work
ing overtime, so the clerks fell Into
the habit of eliminating the . last
four letters In routing by way of the
Salt Lake Route, leaving just the
initials "S. P." As a result a great
deal of business Is said to have been
diverted from the Salt Lake Route
to the Southern Pacific.
In' other Instances the passengers
have gone over one road and the
baggage over the other and trouble
without end resulted. By erasing
the old name from the guides and
stationery and substituting the
name "Salt Lake Route" .Instead,

An investigation of the high pric
es for tungsten apparently shows
that once again we are paying tho
price of not providing preservation
for our infant industries by a protec
tive tariff. Prior to the embargo
upon this metal tungsten mining
was not profitable. To contend with
foreign producers, it was often nec
essary to sell the ore as low as $5.
80 per unit. Before. 191 3 there was
a slight tariff upon this metal, but
in that year, although Colorado min
ers strlved to secure the retention of
the tariff, it was discontinued. Con
sequently the tungsten industry was
in a very bad way when war was
declared, and was therefore slower
in responding to the demands upon
it.
ACCIDENT AT THE DORIS
COMPANY'S NEW MILL

about 12 feet, and was quite badly

YOUTHFUL VANDALS IN

number of headstones by throwing
rocks at them. As a result of their
pranks the greater injury was no

MINING SCHOOL GIVES
TEST TO SELL TUNGSTEN
Pulverize the specimen and horn
or pan it as if making a test for free
gold; take the heel, or heaviest por
tion of the panning, and mix with
three or four times its quantity an
equal mixture of soda and potash.and
fuse In an iron or platinum spoon, or
on charcoal with a blow-pipe. Fuse
not below a red heat and until action
ceases. Part of the advantage of us
ing a mixture instead of soda or pot
ash alone is that the action takes
place at a ower heat. Baking soda
may be used without potash, but a
higher heat is required.
Dissolve the fused mass in a solu
tion of hydrochloric acid and water,
about one part acid to four of water.
Then add a little tin, which may be
scraped off a can or otherwise ob
tained and simmer down to a small
volume. If the solution turns blue
send a portion of the original spec!
men now suspected of containing tun
gsten to a chemist for final determi
nation, since there are other elements
if present, that will give a similar
color under the above test.
If the blue falls to make Its ap-
perance there is no possibility of
the sample containing tungsten. Tun
gsten oxide is yellow and often t
residue that separates out of the sol
ution as it is boiled or simmered
down which will be stained yellow
on account of he iron which is rare
ly absent. The iron is changed by
the acid to Iron chloride which im
parts a yellow to the residue and
.this has occasionally been mistaken
for tungsten oxide.
CALIENTE, Nev., May 26 Last
Saturday morning, Mrs. Alexander,
who lives about a half-mile "below

who "she says, was a Mexican.
The foreigner appeared at her
home, stating that he was hungry

Alexander told the visitor that she
would prepare somthlng for him
