MUST RESTORE RIGHTS
OF NEUTRALS AT ONCE
State Department Preparing to

Ij
Washington. May 26.—The United
States, denouncing interference with
neutral mails, has notified Great Brit­
ain and France that it can no longer
tolerate the wrongs which Americans
have suffered and continue to suffer
through the "lawless practices thoso
governments have indulged in, and
only a radical change in policy, re­
storing the United States to its full
rights as a neutral power will be- sat­
isfactory.
This notification is given in the lat­
est American communication to tha
two governments, the text of which
was made public by the state depart­
ment tonight. The time in which
the change must be effected is no?
specified, but the United States ex­
pects prompt action.
"Onerous and vexatious" abuses,
which have been perpetrated by the
Itritish and French governments in
seizing and censoring neutral mails
are cited in the communications, and
answers are made to the legal argu­
ments contained in the reply of the
Entente governments to the lirst Am­
erican note on the subject.
It is vigorously set forth that not
only have American commercial in­
terests been injured, but. that the
rights of property have been violat­
ed and rules of international law
and custom palpably disregarded.
'Notice is served that, the United
states sewn, will Place claims against
ihe British nnd French governments
for the losses already sustained.
The text of the communication ad­
dressed to the British and French am­
bassadors was delivered Wednesday.

All Hope Abandoned

Until Late Next Week
Waukegan, 111., May 26.—Hope of
obtaining a jury before the week ends
was bright today, when the court told
the attorneys he wished they would
agree" on the third panel by tomor­
row noon. Orpet, a University of
Wisconsiit student, is on trial, charg­
ed with the murder of a former sweet­
heart, Marian Lambert.
The second panel was sworn in
shortly before nooh. To obtain the
eight jurors in the box, 691 venire­
men have been examined, consuming
11 days.
Comprising the new panel are: J.
J. Brand, a wall paper and paint man
of Highland Park E. J. Bock of High­
land Park, formerly superintendent
of the Chicago & Milwaukee Electric
railroad, James CShea of Waukegan.

youth, -coming into the court after it
had convened in the morning and
kissing her son in view of the jurors
and kiSsing him again in the after­
noon when she leaves, shortly before

This was done, the state contend­
ed, to unduly influence the jurors.
Young Orpet is not kept in the

permitted to be seated at the coun­

challenge.

WITHOUT A SOUL
Courtroom scene ill trial of Dr. Arthur
the Bismarck Dnily Tribune. Left to ri^'h

BY IDA M'GLONE GIBSON
New York, May 2U--A man without,
a soul!
That is my iuiiiih for Dr. Arthur
Warren Wailo, tln young dentist, on

young man who, lias confessed that
he poisoned his father-in-law, John
E. Peck of Grand Rapids, Mich, and
his mother-in-law, Mrs. Peck, a be­
nign old man and a sweet old lady
who loved him, and that his young
wife, who loved liim, would have been
next—his object being to do away
with the persons who stood between
himself and inheritance of part of tlio
Peck fortune.
We have in the year l!)t(J, being
tried, for his iil'c in the most mod­
ern city in the world, a medieval mon­
ster. In the courtroom 1 have looked
upon a youthful "Dr. Jekyl" and felt
that "Mr. Hyde" was lurking beneath
ready to torture or kill if the mood
was on him.
All through court sessions, in looks
and bearing, this man, on trial for
his life, is apparently not different,
from any of the reporters who sit just
behind him.
There is utter lack of sophistication
in his face and his bearing is always
that of a younK man who has been
made much of.
"He 1s utterly irresponsible," said
his attorney, vvalter Rogers Deuel, to
me.
"You know we sometimes say this
of people who are careless or selfish,
but we do not mean, it absolutely. In
the case of Waite he is as irrespon­
sible and unaware of sin as a good
natured puppy, who would tear a
beautiful pliunaged bird to pieces,
then bring the poor manm creature
to his master, expecting commenda­
tion."
Again I looked at Waite, trying to
make this judgment coincide with
what 1 saw before me, for not a hint
of this was shown in his counten­
ance or bearing.
When jurymen were selected
Waite rose to his feet jauntily,
buttoned his double-breasted coat
as though it were an instinctive
