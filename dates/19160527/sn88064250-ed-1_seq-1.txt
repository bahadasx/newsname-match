DR. LAFLEUR KILLED
IN CENTRAL AMERICA
WELL KNOWN OPELOUSAS PHYS ICIAN AND MIAMBER OF PROMI
NENT ST. LANDRY FAMILY MEETS DEATH AT HANDS OF
GUATEMALAN SOLDIERS
Dr. Moise Lefleur, a native of St.
Landry and regarded as an Opelou
sas boy and a member of one of the
most prominent families of this
.parish, was shot down by Guate
malan soldiers on the border di
viding Guatemala from British
Honduras last week. News reached
brothers of the unfortunate. youth
on Tuesday night by telegram. br.
Lafleur was about 28 years old, was
a graduate of Lafayette Industrial
Institute, Louisiana State Univer
sity and Tulane Medical College.
, About six months ago Dr. La
fleur was employed by the United
Fruit Company as ship, physician,
being stationed on boats between
New Orleans and Central America.
Reports from Central America,
which were very meager, were to
the effect that Dr. Lafleur and a
party of seven men, who were en
gaged in scientific research work
in British Honduras, were taken for
revolutionists, and were fired upon.
Dr. Lafleur and the guide of the
party were killed.
The research party was in the
habit of making frequent trips to
the border and the soldiers' act is
hard to explain.
Dr. Lafleur was a son of the late
Ertemon Lafleur, for half a cent
SHERIFF SWORDS DENIES
OPPOSITION TO FEE BILL
St. Landry Man States That He Is
Supporting the Administration
As A Life-Long Democrat
"I am supporting the administra
tion as a Democrat who has all his
life been a Democrat," said Sheriff
Swords, entering a denial to the an
nouncement that he is interested
in opposing the administration pol
icy on the fee system.
"The sheriffs, as officials elected
by the people under the constitu
tion, are entitled to say something
about the matters that are concern
ed in the making or umnaking of
the positions to which they are
elected. But there is not a sheriff
in Louisiana who is not ryais at
this miment to do everytniag in his
power to make the adminiiratet-i a
success.
"All we are asking for is a safe
and sane discussion of the s:,te'n
under which we hold our c(:~miut
sions from the people before the
legislature acts. There ain't no use
going ahead and doing something
in a half-baked sort of way that
won't operate fair play as weil as
the welfare of the state."

CHIEF HAYES DECLARES
WAR AGAINST ALL DOGS
June the First Is the Limit Set for
, Roaming Dogs Without Mur
zie or Tag
Chief Clarence L. Hayes has de
clared war against all dogs. If you
are a dog, you had better look out.
June the first is set as the limit
for Opelousas dogs to roanm about
the streets. After that date any
dog seen on the streets without a
muzzle or tag will be shot down by
the city marshal
Tags can be procured at the
Mayor's oflfice for $2.00 each.

HOG CHOLERA FINALLY
PLACED UNDER CONTROL
Entire "arish Was Threatene.
With Disease for Some Time
But Attention Was Given
For a time it was thought that
the greater portion of the parish
would be infested with hog chol
era. Prompt and vigorous atten
tion given by swine breeders, who
were ably assisted in the fight by
W. M. Babin, farm demonstrator,
served to cheek the disease and put
it under complete control. Now
the disease has entirely disappear
ed.
The loss caused by the disease can
not be estimated but thousmands of
dollars worth of hogs went into oh
livion by the way of hog cholera.
The experience had by swine
owners during the past month was
costly as well as valuable; it is the
opinion of some that henceforth
owners of bogs will be more careful
and will not fail to vaccinate their
stock, as advised by the State Ez
periment Station.
ury one of the most prominent and
influential farmers of the Prairie
Ronde section. He is survived by
several brothers and sisters, among
whom are Mrs. Albert Prudhomme,
Mrs. F. D. Cortez, both of Mallet,
Alide, Omar, Rael, Dr. Ertemon,
Sinae and Dimmick Lafleur.
The news of the tragic death of
the well known Opelousas physi
cian came as a severe shock not
only to his numerous relatives in
this and Evangeline parishes but
to his numberless friends through
otut Louisiana.
An effort will be made to bring
the body to Opelousas for "-.
ment, brothers of the deceased
having wired authorities to ship
the body to this city.
Before going with the United
Fruit Company Dr. Lafleur prac
ticed in Swords for several months,
after his graduation from Tulane.
He was looked upon as a splendid
physician and bright prospects were
in store for him.
It is very likely that an investi
gation of the killing of young La
fleur will be asked of the Guatema
lan authorities by the United States
officials, as Dr. Lafleur was an
American citizen.
ASKS REORGANIZATION OF
THE SUPREME COURT
Bill Providing for Seven. Instead of
Five Justices Is Introduced
Baton Rouge, May 23.-The Lou
isiana Bar Aassociation's bill pro
viding for reorganization of the
State Supreme Court was intro
duced in the Senate Tuesday by
Senator Provosty.
The bill provides that there shall
be seven instead of five Supreme
Court justices, and six Supreme
Court districts: Two of the jus
tices shall be elected from the dis
trict comprising New Orleans, and
each of the five country districts
shall elect one of the five other
justices.
The court's jurisdictional aount
is raised by the bill from $2,'0 to
$4,000.
Criminal cases shall be appeala
ble to the courts of appeals, and the
Supreme Court shall handle crimi
nal cases involving death or life
imprisonment penalties.
Another Supreme Court bill was
introduced in the Senate by Sena
tor Leon Smith, of Caddo. The
Smith bill differs from that of the
Bar Association only in a few par
ticulars. It fixed the justices' an
nual salary at $7,500, while the asso
ciation measure says nothing about
salary. Supreme Court justices are
now paid $6,000 a year.
The Smith bill also states that in
passing upon criminal cases, car
rying extreme penaltieA, the Su
preme Court shall hear the law and
facts in the case.

PROMINENT OLD CITIZEN
STANDS OPERATION WELL
C. S. Hollier 75 Years Old, Did Not
Dread the Operating Knife and
Is Now Doing Well
C. S. Hollier, head of one of the
prominent families of this city, de
spite old age, successfully stood a
serious operation at the St. Landry
Sanitarium, on last Saturday and
is doing as nicely as could be ex
pp ted. The operation was per
formed by Dr. Allen of New Or
leans.
Mr. Hollier had been suffering for
sometime; he was brought to the
sanitarium but it was feared that
he was too weak to stand the knife;
the old gentleman, however, who is
75 years old, was determined to get
over his sickness and finally pre
vailed upon the surgeon to operate.
The many friends of the Hollier
family hope that the old gentle
man will be completely recovered
within a short time.

JURORS TAKIE THEI
SEATS NPXT WEEI
New Parish Governing Body Will
Organize at June Meeting
FRIENDLY CONTEST IS
EXPECTED FOR PRESIDENT
Half of the Incemin' 3itmbers Are
Fresh from the Voters of St.
Landry
St. Landry's new police jury will
effect organization on the first
Tuesday in June, when a president
and other officers will be elected
and the new members take their
places.
There will be a few new faces in
the police jury which will assume
charge of the affairs of the parish
next month. Every ward has sent
in new members. In fact half' of
the members were not in the police
jury during the past four years, al
though one of them, Theodore Dou
cet, of Grand Prairie, has already
served as a juror.
The first ward will be represented
by Sam Evans, J. T. St. Cyr, H. D.
Larcade, Sr., and R. Lee Mills; the
second, Joe. E. Dailey and Barousse
Beaugh; third ward, Dr. F. O. Pavy
and Robert Lanclos, Jr.; fourth, K.
T. Catlett, Walter Brown and J. B.
Babington; fifth, Theodore oDoucet,
Alexandre Sylvestre and Fred Mar
tin; sixth, W. C. Dejean and Allen
McCoy.
The fight for the presidency of
the police jury is expected to be an
interesting but friendly one; nolone
seems to have the insi4e track and
the election is considerted in doubt.
The veteran membeI` from the
fourth ward, K. T. Catlett, was the
first to announce; J. E. Dailey, the
oldest member in point of service,
announced early in the gazne. Wal
ter Brown and Dr. F. O. Pavy are
others who may throw their hats
into the ring.
J. J. Healey will probably be re
elected clerk of the police jury
without opposition.
