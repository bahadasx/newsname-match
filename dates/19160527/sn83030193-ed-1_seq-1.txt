"Ib is useless to discuss at this mo

Justice Says English Will Be
Charging Him With Mur

DUIU.lN (via London), May 27.
Tho names of Judge Daniel Cohalan
of tho New York Stato Supreme
Court nnd Dennis Spolllssy, a New
York lawyer, worn mentioned by
Major I'rlco In his testimony before
tho Irish commission Investigating
the Sinn Fein rovolt, In connection
with money sent from America to the
Sinn Felners.
Major Price said that $100,000, most
ly American gold, had reached the
Irish rcvolutlonlstn during the first
six months after tho war broke out.
"I supposo they'll bo charging mo
with murder next," wna tho comment
of Justice Daniel F. Cohalan when
told of tho Dublin despatch. "It is
absurd, ridiculous, to say that I had
anything directly to do with any
money srnt to Ireland for such n
purpose. There was a fund raised
heto by Irish sympathizers, but
evetyhnily In tho United States know
of that fund, and Major I'rlco was
divulging no secret when ho told of
It on the witness stand."
Dennis A. Spolllssy chuckled when
told of Major Price's testimony.
"He hasn't told tho half of what
wo did over hero on this sldo to free
Ireland," ho said. "I am tho National
Treasurer of tho fund which was
started to help tho revolutionists.
My report up to May 24 showed that

"Tha fact that our Irish patriots
uro being shot down by Englishmen
only adds to tho feeling against Eng
land among Irish sympathizers In

"Let that message bo sent over tho

Tho committed now has on record
much of tho rnmlllratlons of tho po
lice "llstonlng In" system, nnd It haa
developed that hotol telophono wires
woro tapped and also those of law
yers nnd doctors In soarch of crlino
or to locato suspected criminals.
It has been admitted tho police
huvo caught fugitives by hear
ing them communicate with their
counsel over tho phone, but It Is
nsscrted the confidential relation be
tween lawyer and client, or physician
and patient, In novcr abused.
Yesterday's testimony revealed that,
although It had been contended only
three wires Tiero tapped In tho chari
ties caso by the police, a fourth wire,
that of the Hotel Irving, was tapped
bccauHo Hobtrt W. Hebbcrd, former
secretary of the Stato Hoard of Chari
ties, was !ling there. Mayor Mltchcl,
In notifying Senator Thompson of
this tap, said ho did not know of It
until Thursday, and that tho police
took no conversations over this wire.
Tho Hotel Uroztell telephone wire
nlso was tapped, It was admitted, In
the Seymour case. And one momher
of tho police wlre-tnpplng squad tes
tified that tho wires of five lawyers
were tapped to obtain Information ns
to tho whereabouts of certain clients.
Most of this Information came from
Georgo Yunge, first class dotcctlvo
sergeant, In charge of tho wire-tap-ping
squad.
Yungn said ho had beon at tho
wiretapping work four years, the
system having been Inaugurated un
der Ctfmmlssloner Waldo. On some
cases tho work Is carried on night
nnd day. Reports aro mado to tho
Commissioner of every conversation

when theisn others glvo directions for
tho tapping of wires. All tho super

quarters; tho location of this place
was kept secret.
"None of my men ever listened In
on any wlro unless It wits author

In answer to other questions he
said:
"Wo do not tako down all tho con
