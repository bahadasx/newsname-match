which be acquired possession of the
Inspiration Needles copper mine in

as greater than at any time since the
opening of the Inspiration mine. The
property ia wlthlng 1200 feet of the
Live Oak shaft of me Inspiration.
A recent issue of the Phoenix, Ari

"the young and brilliant mining pro
moter from Nevada."
Harry and his bromer Louis bad
their start In the promotion game
in Tonopah where they began In a
fiiodest way conducting a small store
where the Kind firm is located. At
the beginning they did not carry
much of a stock as tliey had only
an attenuated shoestring to work on
but by shrewd management and quick
conversion of stock they kept their
money turning until soon they owned
one of the largest commercial estab
lishments In Tonopah. When Gold
field began to boom, the brothers fol-
lowed the rush and opened the lied
Front store on lower Main street be-!
low Crook where Hiey did a land
office business. This was 'the age
of promotions and the boya could not
resist the temptation to get in on the
ground floor which they did to the
extent of organizing Beveral compan
ies on which they maae a neat turn.
When the Rawhide boom set in
they hit the trail again as It "Was the
nature of the boys to be on the ground
floor whenever there was anything of
a promising nature. In' FtwhWe they
bought out the stoc and title of the
K. Marks company and proceeded to
expand at a rate that surpassed the
best hopes of their friends. They
grew so rapidly that a second store
across the street was added to their
holdings and there' the boys thrived
until it developed that they had ex
ceeded' the credit of the firm they had
bought out and then creditors began
worrying about payments. The Lef
kovitz boys had been devoting con
siderable time to mlmng and promo
tions leaving the management of their
store to the heads of departments.
These men over bought In the most
extravagant fashion. The chief of the
hardware division orcered a carload
of giant powder that came through
with a-slght draft attached for $5,000.
The next day another sigbt draft for
$6,500 was presented to cover a car
load of sugar which the grocery head
had ordered. Then the demands grew
so numerous that the Lefkovlts boys
found themselves up against the law
and engaged Charles L. Richards to
straighten out the tangle. The result
was they left Rawhide without any
bank roll and were next heard of in
San Francisco whey they began as
though they had never met ith
r"erse. The boya also had an ex
perience in Manhattan that gave them
a boost downhill. They had been
operating there with a store and pro
moting nil the side and got pretty
well sewed up when the earthquake
came and the firm blew up.
Through all their dealings no one
ever cast a doubt on the Integrity of
the boys who had the reputation of
always paying off their debts.

Death of General Gallieni

VERSAILLES,' May 27. General
Joseph Gallieni, idolized by the French
as the savior of Paris, in the battle of
the Marne, in the critical days 0f
August, 1914, died today. He rushed
80,000 to the battle of the Marne,
which turned the tide In favor of the
French.'
Of all the French generals in the
European war few had a better filled
life than General Gallieni, who, on
the outbreak, of the great war in
August, 1914, was appointed military
governor of the entrenched camp of
Paris! Born of a military family at
St. Beat, April 24, 1849, he had reach-
the age limit for retirement In 1913,
but was maintained In active service
by decree, the minister of war bold
that the services be had rendered as
governor general of Madagascar justi
fied an exception generally made only
In favor of generals who have held
a supreme command in the face of
the enemy.
' In the forty-five years of hia mili
tary career, Gallieni had participated
in some of the dramatic episodes of
the, war of 1870, explored the Upper
Niger and imposed a French protector
ate over the region; pacified the
colony of Indo China, deposed Queen
Ranavola of Madagascar and conquer
ed and developed the colony. - Be
tween times he had written four no
table books on the exploration.
On August 27, 1914, with the Ger
mans threatening Parts, he waa given
the important post of commander of
the entrenched camp and military
governor of Paris. The question of r
declaring Paris an open town was ser

SURRENDER
A rare treat is in store for the pub-
lift in a very short time when the
work of the pupils of the manual train
ing school and that of the domestic
Bcience will be placed on exhibition.
In the fifth and sixth grades, sewing is
taught to all the pupils and occasion
al lessons , in cooking. In the
seventh and eighth grades both sew
lug and cooking Is taught and contin
ued through the high school. Mrs.
Smith has adopted the Individual me
thod of Instruction, which, of course,
means more work for the teacher, but
owing to conditions, it has been neces
sary to carry out this plan. Then, too,
verv little attention is devoted to
fancy work. Utility has been the first
thing to consider and the garment
that is needed is given the preference
in each instance.
There will be about seventy five
dresses In the exhibit and though the
designs are very simple, the attractive
ness of the work of the pupils Is won-

derful. The graduating class will have
made every piece of their apparel for
the evening. The dresses must not
cost more than five dollars. The ma
terials are of voile, marquisette, organ
dy, mull, soft silks, and trimmings are
of lace In moat instances. No flowers
will be used on this occasion. , The
general design favors a slightly de
collette and skirts are nine inches
from floor. .
The work of the various grades
shows a marked Improvement during
the past few months. The little tots
run close seconds to some of . the
larger girls and many are deft nee-dleworkers.
The girls of the eighth grade will
each have a dress to display to fond
friends and the interested public, Con
sidering that the major part of the
pupils hitherto had no training in
sewing, there Is small wonder that
parents and public are so gratified
with the progress of the children.

PARIS, May 27. A campaign by the
extreme anti clerical elements of the
Radical and Socialist parties against
the presence of priests at the battle
tronts in daily contact with soldiers
haa brought sharply Into 'public notice
the work that these priests have done
and are doing at the front.
Thus about 100 priests and half as
many Protestants and Israelites were
authorized to accompany the army.
The number of priests who have
given their lives on the field of bat
tle has not yet been counted, for be
sides the chaplains there are several
thousand priests Incorporated in the
auxiliary services, or who volunteer
ed for active service. A. great many
deaths, however, have been reported
among the chaplains under heroic cir
cumstances. The Rabbi, Abraham
Hloch, was fatally wounded at Saint
Die by a fragment of a shell at the -moment
when he banded a crucifix to
a wounded soldier who had taken him
