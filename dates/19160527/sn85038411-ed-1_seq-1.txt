The district attornev called three
alienists to court to state their belief
that Dr. Arthur Warren Waite is sane
and was shamming when he tried to
make it appear that lie was not men

were reports that the prosecution had

who helped Wnite prepare for the dis

most remarkable characteristic of his
behavior on the stand.

Waite case was concluded this mom

his address to the jury.
Believes He Was Sane
Dr. Waite entered the courtroom
with the same apparently resigned,
nonchalant manner that has charac

The whole nation will once

While this annual tribute to the

dead has always made strong ap-
I peal to all divisions of the popu

because our own country has been

observance of Memorial Day on

• Harrisburg Should Discard "Measure"
Method of Selling Commodities
While Harrisburg will probably not
take kindly to the proposed plan to

economical and advantageous to deal

DIAMOND GONE;
SO IS AGENT
Woman Has Ring Declares Ex
press Clerk Who "Took
Her Measurements"
Adams Express Company officers
are investigating the mysterious dis
appearance of a diamond ring con
signed to Aliss Nila Woodcock, 449
Swatara street, Steelton, believed to
huve been stolen from the Steelton
office.
When the usual time for opening
the Steelton office came this morning,
C. J. Liljenberg, division agent of the
company, went to the office to investi
iiatt circumstances surrounding the
disappearance of the ring,
i Until a late hour H. T. Brosey, the
Stetlton agent, did not appear at the
office and this afternoon officers of
the company were endeavoring to lo-
I cate the absent agent.
The ring was sent to Steelton front
Waynesboro, Thursday, May 18, and
according to the story Mr. Brosey told
K. E. Smith, an uncle of Miss Wood
cock, the diamond was stolen from
I the pa-kage some time between last
I Friday when it arrived and yesterday
when Mr. Smith began to make In
quiries.
Krosey, according to Mr. Smith, ad
nutted that the ring had been stolen
while in his custody but insisted that
someone else was guilty ot the theit.
Hi later informed Mr. Smith that the
ring was in the possession of a
".Dorothy Dockey" and that he thought
' she- had gone to Pittsburgh.
This morning a reporter questioned
-Mrs. J. A. Steele, 359 Myers street,
Steelton, a widow, who admitted that
she was the "Miss Dockey' to whom
the absent express agent referred. She
I denied, however, that she had any
j knowledge of the ring.
"How did you conie to meet Mr.
Brosey," inquired the reporter.
"Why he put in an application for
a position for me as a clerk while 1
was employed at 141 South Kront
street, just across from his office,"
the woman replied. "He took my
measurements one day and then sent
the paper away," she continued.
Going on "Vacation"
"I often stopped in to see whether
he had any reply to my application
and he asked me once to go out with
him and told me he was single and
rtsided at a fashionable local club.
He told me he was ifoinc to Palm
Beach soon for a vacation."
After reading in the Telegraph last
e\er.ing that an investigation was be
ing started, Brosey went to a Steel
tcii drug store and telephoned his wife
that he wouldn't be home during the
night.
"I am here with Detective Ibach
and another officer and we are going
to watch the office. Go buy a Harris
burg Telegraph and you'll see why
I'm watching the place," he explained.
Mrs. Brosey could not be located
to-day but a neighbor at the Brosey
home, 273 Hamilton street, declared
that the express agent has not been
home since yesterday.
Officials of the Express Company
have been unable to open the safe in
the Steelton office and as yet do not
know whether there are any dis
crepancies in the agent's accounts.
