threat of Zapata to attack all trains

the fact that for some time the State

The exceptions are made In cases
where the Americans Intend going only

Americans should be discouraged from

HIS FAIE DY NIGHT; KAISER AT VERDUN,
JII GETS CHARGE 120,000 BY FRENCH
Both Sides Conclude Case Early
in Day and Summing Up
Arguments Are Made.
DEFENSE ASKS ACQUITAL
The Waltc case went to tha
jury at 1:23 p. m. today.
NEW YORK, May Z7.-Dr. Arthur
WarTen Walte, arch poisoner, on trial
for the murder of his father-in-law,
John E. Peek, probably will know his
fate within a few hours.
Justice Shearn began his charge to
the Jury early this afternoon after State
and defense had summed up with brief
closing arguments to the Jury.
Gazing steadily at Assistant District
Attorney Brothers, Walte heard hlm
Mlf denounced as a cruel, cunning mur
derer, and heard Brothers demand that
ho be sent to the electric chair, with
out a trace of emotion. His attitude
was no different when Attorney Deuel,
In his defense, begged the Jury not to
vote the death veraict for a man "born
a criminal."
Liely speculation on the Jury's delib
erations flow about the courtroom as
Justice Shearn began his closing ad
dress. An Interrogation put by Juror Joseph
Trent to one of the three State's alien
ists who declared Walte sane refused
much comment.
Trent asked whether the alienist could
positively declaro tho dentist sane, In
view of his demeanor on the witness
stand, J his question Indicating that-
wanes nonchalant appearance had
made considerable Impression upon at
least a portion 'of tho Jury." "
Reviews Crimc-JCaner.
Deuel reviewed briefly the dentlst'a
crime career, in summing up, and de
manded to know if any Juror In view of
these facts, believed his client sane.
"Dr. Walte has gone before you, and
has told you his life story," said Deuel.
"It has been corroborated. That should
be enough. That he la not normal
must be apparent. Even tho alienist
for the prosecution said he was a 'born
criminal' though they disliked to use
the term.
"There Is no evidence that he was
born with a moral sense and lost It. Ho
never had any moral acme. He has
been a defective all his life. He was
a defective when he poisoned Mr. Peck
and he Is a defective now.
"Just consider that Walte sent germs
to Peck, dampened his rubbers so that
he might catch cold, dampened his bed
sheets for the same purpose, also his
automobile seat: that he tried to cause
Peck Intestinal trouble, and then In
despair poisoned him with arsenic, and
gave him chlorform, and to cap It all,
finished by smothering him with a
pillow.
Insane Man's Personality.
"Is that the work of a sane man or
a lunatic?
"When you take the history of his
whole life you will note that tho mur
der of Peck was not dependent upon his
environment, it was dependent on his
personality. And the personality Is that
of an insane man. Now the ftreat Ques
tion Is, what are we to do with such a
man-
"Con we consider for one moment the
possibility of letting such a human go
among us again? I think the answer is
'no.' But can't we reconcile the facts
.with the personality and nrotect so
clety against this man nnd against him.

Twelve Men Said to Have Been
Unanimous Against Convic

"Not guilty" was the verdict re
turned in the Rlggs Bank perjury
trial at 1 1 :35 o'clock today.
The jury was out but nine min
utes, when word was received from
the jury room that the twelve men
were, ready to return their decision.
Justice Siddons had left the court
house to go to his luncheon, how
ever, and the return of the jury to
the courtroom was postponed until
.the justice could be brought back.
The. twelve men filed into the
room, E. Lawrence EngTe,uIefore

Charles C. Glover, William J. Fla

behind their array of counsel while
Clerk McKce questioned the .fore
man of the jury as to the verdict.
EACH REPLY "NOT GUILTY.''
Foreman , Engle answered, "Not
guilty." to the Individual charge against
each of tho defendants as read bv the
clerk of the court.
When Juutlce Siddons announced the
discharge of tho defendant, the three
men, their counsel and numerous of
their friends In the courtroom crowded
around the Jurors to phake their hands,
Frank J. Hogan. of counsel for the
defendants stipulating that he was
speaking for himself, eald:
"On October 1 Inst, I publicly an
nounced that tho Indictments was proof
of malice. Now I say that the malig

reach their target. I shall welcome
with keen delight tho 'pportuntty to
try before a Jury of American citizens
the charges of the Rlggs National Bank
against McAdoo and Williams."
Rush To Congratulate Bankers.
Shortly after word came from the Jury
room that the twelve men were ready
for the return of the verdict, scores of
friends of the defendants pressed about
them to extend congratulations on their
acquittal.
William J. Flather outwardly was the
most deeply Impressed of the three de
fendants. Tears welded to his eyes and
wet hla cheeks from the time announce
ment was made that the Jury was ready
to return until after the verdict was
rendered.
"Yes, but you don't know what It
means to me." answered Mr Flather
to friends who tried to console him.
An affecting scene was that In which
Mrs. Hogan greeted her husband when
the verdict had been announced. Tears
were In evidence In her eyes as well aa
thogf of many others about her when
tho verdict was announced.
Other principals In the trial were ap
parently under high tension until the
verdict of the Jury -was announced.
Some, of the wives of the Jury were
in the courtroom and crowded In the
wake of the defendants and their coun
sel to shake hands with their husbands,
whom they had not seen at home dur
ing the three weeks of the trial.
The Jury was out exactly seven an4
one-hnlf minutes when they decided
upon the verdict. It is said that only,
one ballot was taken, at which the
opinion of all of the men concerning
the Innoncence of the defendants was
unanimous.
Marshals Relieved.
Deputy United States Marshals Ryan

announced their agreement.
Immediately following dismissal of
the Jury by Justice Siddons, both
