C. B. BUCKMAN TO
VISIT IN BEMIDJI
DURINGNEXTWEEK!
(By a Special Correspondent.)
Little Falls, Minn., May 27.C.
B. Buckman, Republican candidate
for congress from the Sixth district,
has the "constructive" idea so firmly
fixed in his mind that up to this time
he has found little time to get over
the district in the interests of his
own candidacy.
Only recently Mr. Buckman con
structed one of the largest and most
up-to-date garages in the northwest
and two modern homes. This spring
he purchased property which has
been idle for years and is now build
ing three modern cottages. This lat
ter work has so taken his time that
he has been unable to meet the vo
ters of the district.
He plans, however, on leaving
some time-next week lor a trip over:
the M. & I., visiting Bemidji, Bau
dette and other points in the north
em section of the district.

ALL ACTION ON
NORMAL SCHOOL
TO BE HELD UP
State Officials Believe That Nothing
Will Be Done Until After the
1917 Legislature.
$20,000 AVAILABLE
NOT 70 BE USED NOW
Work May Be Begun in 191$ Be
midji Man to Confer With State
Board of Control.
St. Paul, Minn., May 27.Defer-
ring all action on the proposed erec
tion of a normal school at Bemidji,
until after the 1917 legislature, seem
ed probable today, because of the
small appropriation available. The
plan is to hold the $25,000 available
August 1, for the school, and see
what can be secured from the next
legislature.
"There's very little we can do with
$25,000," said an official at the capi
tol today. "The chances are that
the money we have, on interest until
1918, and what we could get from
the 1917 legislature, then available,
would permit work to start then."
A. P. White, Bemidji, J. Wise,
Mankato, and E. J. Jones, Morris,
forming a special committee appoint
ed by the state normal school board,
may meet to discuss the matter with
the state board of control*.

MORE WITNESSES IN
NEW YORK CASE
New York, May 27.More wit
nesses were called before Chief Mag
istrate McAdoo yesterday in the John
Doe inquiry to find out whether a
crime was committed in tapping the
telephone wires ip*the law offices of'
Seymour & Seymour. They included
five persons in the employ of William
J. Burns, the detective employed by
J. P. Morgan & Co., to locate a leak
of information regarding war muni
tion contracts handled by the Morgan
firm.
All the reports made by Burns to
his clients were asked for and a rep
resentative of the firm was summoned
as a witness.
The Thompson legislative commit
tee continued its investigation of
telephone wire tapping by the police
by hearing more representatives of
Catholic charitable institutions who
are engaged' in a violent controversy
with the mayor over the right of the
police to "listen in" on their wires.
The mayor charges that leaders of
these institutions conspired to frus
trate the state investigation of chari
ties. Witnesses examined yesterday
absolutely denied these charges. They
admitted the truth of certain tele?
'phone conversations overheard by
the police wire tappers, but asserted
that some of these conversations were
framed to "trap" the eavesdroppers.

"GOOD ROADS DAY"
People of State Requested to Make
a Special Effort for Better
Roads.
PUBLIC IS AWAKENING TO
NECESSITY OF IMPROVEMENTS
Farmers of State Are Losing Much
Money on Account of Poor
Roads.
St. Paul, Minn., May 27.Gover-
nor J. A. A. Burnquist today pro
claimed June 20 as Good Roads Day."
His proclamation in part is as fol
lows:
"The legislature of the state has
wisely requested the designation by
public proclamation of the third
Tuesday of June in each year as
"GOOD ROADS DAY."
Roads Cause Loss.
"More and more is the public
awakening to the necessity of road
improvement and the great value and
importance of permanent road con
struction which will lessen the cost of
the marketing of products and con
tinually increase the volume of traf
fic. It is a well-known fact that the
farmers of our state on account of
bad roads are losing millions of dol
lars annually in the moving of their
crops, aside from the loss occasioned
through the lower value of their
lands by reason of their inaccessi
bility to market.
To Make Special Effort.
"Good roads, however, influence
not only the economic but the, social
conditions of a community by elim
inating the loneliness and isolation
of rural districts and by creating bet
ter opportunities for school attend
ance and social life
"Therefore, the people of the state
are hereby requested to make spe
cial effort on Tuesday, the 20th day
of June, to secure contributions of
labor, material and money toward the
improvement of public highways in
their respective communities."
