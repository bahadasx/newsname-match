Rev. Hon. Archibald James Carey, Ph. D. D. D., Ingloriously
Defeated In His Attempt to be Elected One of the New
Bishops of the A. M. E. Church at Its One Hundredth An
niversary and General Conference at Philadelphia, Pa.
His Alleged Corruption Fund of $5000 Availed Him
Nothing. He and His Associates or Campaign Man
agers Were Sternly and Justly Rebuked For Attempting
to Interject Reprehensible Political Methods Into the
Conference In an Effort to Permit the Bishop's Mantle
to Rest Upon His Broad Political Shoulders
HE HEADED THE ILLINOIS DELEGATION TO THE GENERAL CONFER
ENCE IN A SPECIAL PULLMAN TRAIN. HEADQUARTERS WERE
OPENED UP IN PHILADELPHIA WHICH WERE PRACTICALLY IN
CHARGE OF HON. BOBT. R. JACKSON, HON. OSCAR DE PRIEST AND
HON. LOUIS B. ANDERSON WITH PLENTY OF MONEY IN SIGHT TO
SPEND AMONG THE DELEGATES.
PRIOR TO THE CONVENING OF THE CONFERENCE THE REV. GENTLE
MAN MADE AN EXTENSIVE TOUR THROUGH THE SOUTHERN
STATES IN THE INTEREST OF HIS" CAMPAIGN FOR BISHOP AND
HE AND HIS FRIENDS -FELT THAT HE HAD A-2EAD TTPE'JINCHI
ON ONE BISHOPRIC
SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY ODD DELEGATES ATTENDED THE GENERAL
CONFERENCE AND IT REQUIRED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND
TWENTY-FIVE VOTES TO ELECT A BISHOP. THE HIGHEST VOTE
RECEIVED BY THE POLITICAL PASTOR OF INSTITUTIONAL
CHURCH ON THE FD2ST BALLOT WAS 96 AND ON THE SECOND
BALLOT HE FELL DOWN TO ABOUT 80 VOTES WHERE HE WAS
SECURELY CHAINED TO THE POST AND WAS NEVER ABLE TO
BREAK AWAY FROM IT. REVS. W. D. BECKETT, OF SOUTH CARO
LINA AND I. N. ROSS OF THE BALTIMORE CONFERENCE WERE
ELECTED BISHOPS.
were a long way from their various
homes that they would need the money
to have a good time on and assist to
paint that old town real red and that
with both hands down that he would
bo elected one of the new Bishops on
the very first ballot, but the Gods in
the starry heavens decreed otherwise,
at the same time administering unto
him with an iron hand a stinging andi
BISHOP BENJAMIN F. LEE, WHO HAS BEEN A SUBSCRIBER TO THEj
BROAD AX FOR SOME YEARS; BISHOP H. B. PARKS AND BISHOP
SHAFFER WERE ALL BITTERLY OPPOSED TO THE ELEVATION
OF REV. CAREY, TO THE BENCH OF "BISHOPS AND OPENLY
FOUGHT HIM IN THE CONFERENCE ON ACCOUNT OF HIS PAST
REPUTATION.
IT HAS BEEN STATED ON GOOD AUTHORITY THAT AT NONE OF THE
SESSIONS OF THE CONFERENCE WAS HE PERMITTED TO ADDRESS
HIS BRETHREN WHICH WAS A SEVERE BLOW TO HIM AND A
CRUSHING DEFEAT TO "FT HIGHER SPIRITUAL AMBITION.
THE LONG FIGHT WHICH HAS BEEN WAGED ON HIM IN THESE
COLUMNS IN CONNECTION WITH HIS FAMOUS AND LONG TO BE
REMEMBERED TRIP TO MILWAUKEE, WIS., CUT A WIDE SWATH
AMONG THE DELEGATES AND LONG BEFORE THEY BEGAN TO
VOTE FOR THE ELECTION OF BISHOPS THEY HAD MADE UP
THEIR MINDS THAT THE REV. HON. ARCHIBALD JAMES CAREY,
PH. D. D. D. DID NOT REPRESENT THE BEST MEN AND WOMEN
BELONGING TO THE A. M. E. CHURCH. IN ALL TRUTHFULNESS
IT CAN BE SAID THAT HE DOES NOT NOR NEVER WILL REPRE
SENT THE BEST AND THE MOST PROGRESSIVE COLORED MEN
AND WOMEN RESIDING IN CHICAGO, THEREFORE MAYOR WIL
LIAM HALE THOMPSON SHOULD REMOVE HTM FROM HIS PRES
ENT EASY POLITICAL JOB IN THE CITY HALL.
MAJOR ROBERT R, JACKSON, MAYOR WILLIAM HALE THOMPSON,
HON. MARTIN B. MADDEN, BISHOP SAMUEL FALLOWS, HON.
SAMUEL A ETTELSON, GOV. EDWARD F. DUNNE, HON. OSCAR DE
PRIEST; ALL CONTRIBUTED TESTIMONIALS WHICH APPEAR IN
PULL IN ANOTHER COLUMN OF THIS PAPER ENDORSING THE
CANDDDACY OF REV. A. J. CAREY FOR BISHOP.
Many years ago or during our early
boyhood days down in old Va., when
wo had to attend church three times
each Sunday throughout the year, we
remember very distinctly that both
the saints and the sinners always at
either the morning or at the evening
service would join in with the parson
" sinking that good old familiar song
which runs thusly: The Lord moves in
a mysterious way His wonders to per
form, that lie plants His footsteps on
tho sea and rides upon the storm" and
8 on, and the more wo meditate on the
"ctions of tho delegates who attended
"8 late General A. M. E. Conference
at Philadelphia, Pa., in relation to
J"ig to confer the honored title of
shop on the Bcv. Hon. Archibald
Sies Carcy' Ph-D-D' D' the more
nnly havo wo become convinced that
least sometimes the "Lord really
does move in a mysterious way His
wonders to perform."
None of tho candidates for Bishop
resorted to the damnable and corrupt
methods in order to obtain that object
like unto the Rev. Hon. Archibald
James Carey, Ph. D. D. D. who in the
final round up went down to an in
glorious defeat in his greatest of all
efforts to become one of the new Bish
ops of the church which he has dis
honored so much in every way, until
his sins strongly smells unto the high
heavens; it is claimed or alleged that
he very proudly marched onto Phila
delphia, Pa,, with a corruption fund
amounting well onto five thousand dol
lars and he and his associates or cam
paign managers were foolish enougluto
believe that for money they would be
able to" buy up all tho delegates they
would wdnt; that each and every dele
gate had his price and as many of them
a" lastinjr xebukft for ,nttcmptin"ore5!V
sort to such raw or reprehensible polit
ical methods in an effort to have the
sacred Bishop's mantle to fall on his
broad tricky political and lady-loving
shoulders.
No one attending the conference had
the great drag or pull that he had
gathered unto himself; he headed tho
Illinois delegation which traveled from
this city to Philadelphia, Pa., on a spe
cial Pullman train, on arriving there
he had regular headquarters opened up
with several tons of the letters of en
dorsements and letters of testimonials
from all of the most prominent White
and Colored citizens throughout the
United States, including this city and
the state of Illinois all endorsing his
candidacy for the Bishopric; the letters
and testimonials being freely distrib
uted among the delegates and our emi
nent and distinguished fellow citizens
in tho persons of the gallant Major
Robert R. Jackson, Grand Commander
in Chief of tho Uniform Banks Knights
of Pythias throughout the world; Hon.
Oscar De Priest, Alderman of the Sec
ond Ward and Hon. Louis B. Ander
son were on hand to boost his game
and to loudly sound his praises at
every bend or turn in the road. i
Long before the convening of the
General Conference, the Rev. Hon.
Archibald James Carey, Ph. D. D. D
made an extensive tour through tho
southern states for the sole purpose of
buvincr up a chain of newspapers so
that their editors could get busy with
their whitewash brushes and white wash
him into a bright shining angel so
that he could become sufficiently puri
fied to enter the contest for the Bishop
ric and that southern trip or swing
around the circle among newspaper
men and delegates must have cost him
well onto two thousand dollars, and
on his return to this city ho and his
loud-mouthed friends who have been
endeavoring to make the public
believe that he is the second
Booker T. Washington, felt dead
sure that he had a lead pipe cinch
on that new job and that if any Bish
ops were to be elected that his Lord
and Master would see to it that his
name lead all the rest of the andi
dates for the highest honor that can
be conferred on anyone in tho A. M.
E. Church. '
More than six hundred and fifty
delegates attended the general confer
ence from all parts of this country and
from the isles far beyond the deep
blue seas and it required about three
hundred and twenty-five votes to elect
any one Bishop and after all of the
puffing and blowing on tho part of

Hon. Andrew J. Bedmond, Bepubli
can candidate for Judge of the Su
perior Court, short term, to be voted
for at the Judicial election Monday,
June 5, was born in Philadelphia,
August 1, 1864. When he was still
very young he came with his parents
to De Kalb, Illinois, where he was
brought up on a farm. He attended
public school, and later a school for
teachers at Oregon, Hlinois. After
completing his course there, he studied
at the Northwestern Illinois Normal
School.
He began his career as a teacher,
but being ambitious to practice law,
he came to Chicago in 1889 and en
tered the Northwestern University
Law School, from which he graduated
with the degree of LL. B. Since that
time he has continued actively in the
practice of his profession for a long
time occupying an- extensive suite of
law offices on, the 16th floor of the
Otis Building; in 1895 Mr. Bedmond
was happily united in marriage to
Miss Emma Robertson, daughter of Mr.
John Robertson, the successful banker
of Barrington, Illinois and from 1S96
to the present time Mr. and Mrs. Bed
mond have resided in a lovely home in
Oak Park, where they are held in the
highest esteem by a largo circle of
friends.
He has honorably served in the past
as attorney for the Town of Cicero,
and again attorney for Barrington, For
est Park, Wauconda, Lake Zurich and
River Grove.
His home town or the village of
Oak Park has recently passed the fol
lowing resolution in favor of his can
didacy for Judge of the Superior
Court.
Whereas, tho services of Andrew J.
Bedmond as attorney for this district
were of the character worthy of the
highest commendation, and
Whereas, Mr. Redmond has at all
times enjoyed the esteem and confi
dence of the citizens of Oak Park, and
Whereas, he is now a candidate for
Judge of tho Superior Court of Cook
County,
Therefore, recognizing his fitness and
ability, we, the members of the Village
Board of Oak Park, do hereby endorse
his candidacy and ask all good citizens
to assist in furthering his cause, which
we believe to be in tho best interest
of Cook County.
Mr. Bedmond is an eminent lawyer,
a first class gentleman at all times and
in every way well fitted to become one
of the Judges of the Superior Court.
He is well and favorably known to
the Colored people in this city for on
several occasions he has addressed
them in their churches and it goes
without saying that the Colored peo
ple throughout this city and Cook
County will roll up a solid vote for him
on Monday, June 5, and assist to put
him over the 'plate.
AldexmaB. Oscar De Priest and Capt. .
Louis -B. AndetsoH, returned home tho
first of the -week from Philadelphia,
Pa where .they made an unsuccessful
attempt to land their eminent brother
and co-worker for the Lord Bev. A.
J. Carey, on the Board of Bishops.

Eighth Regiment Illinois National
Guard, Col. Franklin A. Denison, Com
manding will march, to Quinn Chapel,
