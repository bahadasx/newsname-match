The citizens of Kansas City should
welcome the ,N. N. B. League because

races to see some of the accomplish
ments of the Negro race.
Many of the other races see only
the Jail bird, saloon frequenter, the
Ignorant, slothful, and ill mannered
Negro, and accept them as the aver
age standard of the race.
The League brings to us men and
women that have been, and are, en
gaged in agriculture, manufacturing.

THE EDUCATED BOOT BLACK.
By Katheryn M. Johnson, Burlington,
Iowa.
Shine, Mister, shine I
Five cents, a nickel,
Just half a dime.
White shoes, or black,
Russet or tan;
If you want them cleaned good,
1 am your man.
You say you're surprised
At me shining shoes?
Sit down Mr. Walte and
Look at the News.
In just a few minutes,-
Then I'll be through
And explain my present
Position to you. '
I graduated tlast June
With your son,
By many kind deeds
His friendship I won:
I solved many problems
At schdbl for your son;
To him they wero difficult,
To me they were fun.
I thought, when we both
Grew to be men, he would
Help me solve the problems
I had just read of then.
When my diploma was
Presented to me, ,
I tested his friendship,
His manhood, you'll see.
He told me, he was going
In business with you;
I asked for a position in . '
Your store too. -
I said I'd be glad to
Start as a clerk;
From the botlom of the ladder,
Then upward I'd work.
To become a bookkeeper for you
Some day,
For this position, I knew
Was good pay.
Soon In his face, I read his surprise,
Th'en off came the mask,
His friendship disguised.
It's absolutely impossible'
To hire you as clerk;
But I will consider the
Janitor work.
This was the offer to me
By, your son;
The test of the friendship
I thought I had wok,
My first application '
By your son, being denied,
You cannot imagine
How it wounded my pride.
Being ambitious, I started anew,
To find one white man
Whose friendship was 'true.
I put my application in
Every store In this town,
A flimsy excuse, , '
Is all that I found.
That's why you find me
Here; shining shoes.

SOLDIER MASTER DIES; HORSE,
BROKEN "HEARTED, WILL
NOT EAT.
CoIumbus-N, M,, May 12. There's
a horse In Columbus dying of a brok
en heart. He's sound in wind and
limb, but he won't eat or drink, and
he's slowly starving to death.
When the Tenth regiment of color
ed troopers went into Mexico private
George Hundell, of Trodp C rode him.
And when! "stables" sounded on the
bugle at the end of a long, dusty
hike, Hundell was, by the side of his
mount. Hundell cared for him as he
might for a child.
All tho little Intimacies that bind
man and animal together were presi
ent in an accentuated degree between
the two. Hundell carried sugar In his
pocket. The horse nosed the pockets
three times a day. Hundell went
without tobacco, many, many times
that he might buy from tho troop
cook the sweets the animal loved.
Nights when it snowed in tho Sierras,
and Colonel Dodd's cavalrymen, with
one blanket and orders against a fire,
shivered through tho long hours, Hun
dell slept on the picket line, close up
against the horse's neck.
Other animals might kick and roll
and blto on tho line, but Hundell's
horse was different.
Then, on March 29, came tho first
brush between the Americans and
Villa men. Hundell and tho horse
came through safely. But two days
later Hundell was one of a dozen
troopers injured when a Mexican rail
road train rolled down an embank
ment. Ho died later.
Hundell's horso was assigned to
another trooper whoso mount had
been killed at Guerrero. Tho new
rider, who know how Hundell treated
the horse, tried to follow sulL He
carried sugar in Ills' pockets, Tho
horso quit eating sugar. One cold
OUR NATIONAL NEGRO BUSINESS LEAGUE
will meet hero August 17th nnd Jgth. This will give the citi
zens of Greater "Kansas City a great opportunity to show their
hospitality anil the famous Kansas City spirit.
It is the Earnest desire of the Officers of the local League
of Greater Kansas City that every Race-loving man and woman
will join us in this movement and do their duty in helping to
entertain these distinguished guests in a way that will prove to
them that the Kansas City Negroes are a unit when it comes to
race progress and uplift and the many good things that have
been said about us throughout the country are facts beyond a
doubt.
SOME THINGS WE HOPE TO DO.
FIRST: To have all our citizens to fix up their homes and
places of business so that they will present a pleasing appear
ance. This has already been done by many, but we want every
body to catch the step.
SECOND: There are about twenty Officers of the Na
tional Negro Business League. Men who are prominent in the
business and financial world. It would be a mighty nice thing
if some of our families who are able to volunteer to entertain
one or two of them in their homes as guests for the three days.
This has never been done in the other large cities where the
National League, has met, but we want to show them that the
Kansas City, spirit is different from other large cities.
THIRD : 'Some of the special features of the entertainment
of the National Business League and the thousands of visitors
are as follows:. One afternoon will be set aside for an automo
bile ride oyer our beautiful park and boulevard system which
M second to none in the United States.
Kansas City- is heralded throughout the country for the par
excellence'clTher women's clubs and social organizations who
are doing so much for the social life and uplift of our people
in Kansas City. .
We are going to ask these ladies to take charge of the visit
ors one'a'ftenjpon and arrange open houses and receptions in
various sections'of the Negro districts so that in going from
one place to another the visitors will have an opportunity to
see our resident districts.
Any suggestions or assistance will be highly appreciated
Sby the League. .All inquiries or suggestions should be directed
to Prof. J. D. Bowser, 2400 Paseo.

night the troopers tried to sleep on
the picket line as Hundell had done.
The horse rolled on him, and would
have trampled him to death had not
a stable guard Interferred in time to
drag the man away.
Hundell's horse, formerly the ex-
fample of every other troop horse In
the outfit, became-unmanageable.
At first the horse was., to be shot.
A lieutenant pleaded with the cap
tain, and the death verdict was with
drawn. "If you can use him, take him,"
was the answer.
So the horse was held until an am-
Tjulance corps went northward. On
a halter, behind tho jolting wagon,
,the horso went north, too.
He5s In tho veterinarian's care now.
They try to make him eatv A nibble
or two of even the best oats, and the
horse stops. Sometimes a Negro
trooper approaches the corral. The
horse pricks up his ears and trots
up, expectancy In every move. But
tho ears drop and the , brisk gate
stops, and tho thinning sides droop
pitiably. Tho horse doesn't make
mistakes and Hundell is gone.
"I've known of cavalry horses that
' loved their riders," said the whlto
1 haired veterinarian, "but never this
way. Ono of the officers' believed
that to call the horse by name might
bring him around. But it seems that
of our arrangements.
OF GREATER KANSAS CITY
Hundell used to call him 'Baby' and
we don't seem to say it like ho did."
