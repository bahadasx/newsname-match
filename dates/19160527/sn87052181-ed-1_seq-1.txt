OWES MISSOURI NORMAL, TOO
State Is Far In Arrears In Paymentl
to Warrensburg School May
Delay the Work.
If Missouri Is not bankrupt, War
ransburg would like to know why only
about $50,000 of tho quarter million
dollars appropriated by tho last legis
lature for tho rebuilding of tho War
rensburg Normal School has not been
paid.
Warrensburg suffered a half million
dollar loss 'in tho fire In tho winter of
1913. Tho only Insurance on tho school
buildings was $30,000. Back of that is
this fact: Formerly the school carried
$200,000. In Insurance, but stato offi
cials said it was unnecessary for a
stato Institution to Protect itself llnan
daily from rirc; tlrt tho state; would
pay any losses. 5otne Insuranco was
cut down. Then camo the lire and now
tho Warrensburg Normal cannot col
lect from the state.
Warrensburg bankers who havo
been asked by tho school authorities
to help carry tho financial loan, met
recently to consider ways and means.
Tho teachers salaries havo been paid
up to dato by tho state. That Is all.
Requisitions for money duo tho build
ing contractors for work already com
pleted, although declared a Just debt
against tho stato by Mr. Gordon, have
not been paid, and Gordon has sent
word no money Is In Bight for them
nor for tho purchase of supplies badly
needed for tho school work.
Tho contractor is ready to go ahead
If the banks will carry tho requisi
tions. Tho baukera could not decide
they were willing to help out. If they
carry tho requisitions they have havo
to wait for a new legislature to reap
proprlato the appropriations mado by
tho legislature of 1913 and thereby
turn looio enough money to pay tho
debts ot this biennial year. Tho bank
ers will meet again soon. Tho school
authorities hopo they will follow the
example set by tho Columbia, Mo.,
bankers, who advanced $83,000 to aid
the stato university. Unless they do
so, the work ot tho big normal school,
which has more students than ever,
will bo badly crippled.
COOPER MAY WIN BIG PLANT
American Coal Refining Company
Pleased With the Tests Made
of County's Cannel Coal
Charles C. Hoover, chief chemist
for tho American Coal Refining Com
pany, a corporation which Is operating
a big dyo and coal producing plant
In Denver, experimented with sam
ples of Coopor county cannel coal
at Boonville recently and found It to
bo four times as strong In tar, the
product from which dyes and other
by-products aro made, than tho coal
the company Is now using In Denver.
This practically nssures tho establish
ment of tho now $300,000 plant there.
C. V. Fisher, president of the Fish
er Grain Company of Kansas City and
also president of tho American Coal
Refining Company, and W. J. Stev
enson, secretary of tho now corpora
tion, accompanied the chemist.
"Forty-five per cent of the ordinary
cannel coal goes off In smoko and
vapor," said Mr. Hoover. "Wo tako
that and make tho now very valuablo
products, Smmonln and ammonia sul
phite. Wo get about five gallons to
tho ton ot coal and at the sanio tlmo
get 15,000 cubic feet of gas."
- There aro enormous deposits of can
nel coal In Cooper county, which has
been practically worthless, but by
this new process it becomes valuablo
In the making of dyes and oils. Tho
Green Book of Missouri says:
"Coal deposits aro exposed near tho
heads of all tho streams In tho coun
ty and along tho river bluffs. The coal
In these Is both bituminous and can
nel, nnd In somo place the veins are
thirty feet thick. Roughly estimating
there 1h an avcrago of fourteen Inches
of coal In ono bed over twenty-thrco
squaro miles.

II chowed a bit of oat straw
ruminanuy as no sat in
his barn door ono morn
ing in May. Already tho
cherry blossoms iro
sending down their whito shower of
potals.
In tho opposlto corner of tho barn
door sat tho chairman o tho select
men of tho village Ho had Just paid
Rouben what tho farmer considered a
wonderful compliment.
"Of courso," said Reuben, "I expect
to bo present at tho oxerqlses that; day.
'Taln't often this town has a centen
nial, and I ain't likely to seo another,"
smiling whimsically. "When I hecrd
tho Guv-nor was comin' I was moro'n
anxious to go, 'causo ho's got a name
like an old friend of mlno nicest boy
you over see shot 'way back 'in '01 In
a skirmish snmo night I got this holo
In my leg. I kinder think tho Gov'nor
may bo somo kin ot hls'n. Maybo I'll
havo a chanco to got speech with
him."
"Suro you will. Wo don't caro for
oratory, Mr. Hcnshaw. Wo want plain
facts, and you'll glvo us those Good
morning."
Long after Mr. Whitney's top buggy
had disappeared over tho crest of tho
hill, Reuben sat In tho barn door and
mused. In Imagination ho was back
In the autumn morning long ago, when
tho fifteen volunteers ot tho little vlt
lago marched away. How gay thoy
wore, or protended to bo! Tho naplo
troes had spread n flaunting carpet ot
scarlet and gold for tholr feet. Tho
leaves rustled merrily as thoy march
ed, heads up, faces front, Tho girls
waved and cheered, but tho mothers
knew and hid their faces. Ho could
seo his mother's white faco now. Wo
smiled, ns ho recalled Samantha's faco
that morning, round nnd rosy, with a
wealth ot curls on cither side, and
bluo eyes meeting his eyes shyly. Sho
had pressed a small packago In his
hand when ho wont to say good-by tho
ovcnlng beforo. Ho waved his thanks
ns ho passed hor In tho crowd. Dear
little daguerreotype! he had It still,
faded but beautiful to him. Ho must
go and tell her about Mr. Whitney's
compliment. Sho would bo glad to
know. Samantha was always glad
when honors camo to htm.
As ho reached tho kitchen door, Sa
mantha camo down tho steps to help
him. Putting hor hand under his arm
sho said:
"Why, father, I didn't know but I'd
havo to como and get you. Thought
you'd fallen asleep."
"I was dreamln', ma, but I wasn't
asleep. I was way back In war time.
Al Whitney was here this mornln' to
g.'t mo to raako a speech at tho Cen
tennial. 'A Trlbuto to Our Boys of
'01.' ho said I was to call it. But I
nln't goin' to put no such high-flyin'
title ns that on It. If they want an
account of how our boys fit and suf
fered and died, I can givo it."
"That's so, father; no ono can do It
better. But won't you be afraid talkln'
to tho Guv'nor and so many folks?"
Reuben laughod softly. "Now,
mother! tho Guv-nor ain't a day older
than our llttlo Tom would havo beon.
And Just llko 's not Tom would have
been Guv'nor If ho had have lived.
Vo, I ain't a mlto scarod."
Joo, tho hired man, had doublo work
for soveral days after Mr. Whitney's
flslt; for Rouben spent many hours at
tho old desk In tho sitting-room, writ
tag his manuscript laboriously.
At last tho great day dawned, bright
and clear. Preparations had been go
ing on for several days In tho village.
Tho hotel nnd post office were gor
goous In flags and bunting. Flags
floated from many houso windows. At
pno end ot the common a hugo tent
tad beon erected, and thero tho speak
ers would faco tho assemblago. An or
gan had been placed In front of the
rostrum, and a choir of villago boys
and girls drilled for the occasion. The
band from Upper Hallam had volun
teered tholr services. In front of tho
hotel was placed a dlnlng-tcnt to ac
commodato tho overflow. Tho village
was astir early, and long beforo ton
o'clock, tho hour set for tho oxdrclses
to begin, tho church sheds wero filled
with horses, carriages, express wag
ons nnd farm wagons, while n long
lino of nondescript vehicles, with of
ten indifferent locomotlvo power, lined
tho fences. Purveyors of badges and
postal cards wandered up and down
nnd the toy balloon man arrived early.
Tho entire township had poured Its
full measuro ot enthusiasm Into tho
villago; and In tho homo gatherings
wore brought together for the first
time sons and daughters who had

It was all blurred confusion to
Reuben as ho was ushered on tho plat
form nnd saw tho sea of faces boforo
him. He could not distinguish an ac
quaintance, nnd decided that his eye
sight was growing poor. By nnd by
as tho mist cleared ho saw Samantha's
sympathetic faco, and to that faco ho
talked when tho tlmo for hl3 speech
camo. Then Mr. Whltnoy turned and
Introduced "our honored citizen and
solo remaining veteran of tho Civil
war, Mr. Reuben Henshaw." As he
stood up, tottering a llttlo on his
wounded leg, thero was a surprised
murmur at tho rear of the tent among
a group of strangers.
Reuben fumbled for his manuscript,
gripped it tight, and' sought out tho
faco that had never failed him. Then
ho began his speech. "Fellow-citizens,'
neighbors, friends," ho began, "your
chairman selected mo to talk to you
about somo ot tho bravest men this
town ever had. I'vo got it all writ
down here, but my specs ain't workln'

out of this town in tho fall of "01, along
with " Hero followed tho string of
fourteen names well-known and rover
oncod In the villago. Reuben forgot
his audience and talked as ho had
talked many times to the children and
friends who loved to hear his war
stories, giving kindly trlbuto to his
companions ot campfire and battlefield,
telling of lonely "pickets and forced
marches, dwelling upon acts ot brav
ery and fearlessness, till his hearers
thrilled with the recital and many eyes
wero wet. At last the chairman was
obliged to touch him on the shouldor
and tell htm his tlmo was up; and he
sank into his seat amid a thunder of
applause.
Thoro was one more speaker boforo
tho governor should mako tho final ad
dress,. Reuben, his mind freer now,
studied the young governor's faco as
ho sat bending slightly forward to
catch tho speaker's words. "Strango,"
thought the old man, "how much ho
looks llko Tom Dufflold, my old tent
mato and chum. Tom was shot way

Jerk. "Why, I thought I was a boy on

And Reuben looked about In wonder
till his eyes found Samantha's faco
again and rested there. Now the gov
ernor was on hi3 foot. Ho was speak
ing. What was ho saying? Rouben
leaned forward, his old hands with
tholr knotted veins clutching his
knees, his bluo eyes filled with wonder.
"Friends," tho governor was saying,

accepted the duty to spare his friend.
Can you not see him as bo trudges
painfully back and forth on his post?"
"Thero was another- night" tho
governor's voice was quiet now and
all was very still "a small detach
ment of the Fifth was surprised by the
enemy. In tho skirmish that followed,
my father was shot."
Reuben's mouth had fallon opon.
"I kno't; wasn't I thero to seo? But
ho was killed," he murmured.
"His chum," continued tho. gover
nor, "seeing his comrade fall, dashed
in amid a rain of bullets thick as hair,
and dragged tho senseless body to a
place of safety, then disappeared."
"Grays kctched me," muttered Reu
ben. "When my father recovered con
sciousness ho was 1n a field hospital ot
tho Christian Commission. Thero he
learned of his friend's part In that
night attack. Search' was made; but
all effort to find that friend proved un
availing, and ho was given up for dead.
When my father recovered, minus hla
right arm, ho received an honorabl9
discharge, and returned homo. Later
ho loft his homo and went to Ver
mont I learned today that his old
comrado Is still alive. I havo listened
with Interest to tho glowing trlbuto
your speaker has paid to tho volun
teers of this village. But ho has been
too modest. Somo of tho bravest
deeds he has left unrecorded. So I
tako pleasure In giving my Inadequate
testimony to tho bravery and kindness
of your neighbor and my father's com
rade, Reuben Henshaw."
Thoro was not a sound to ba heard
as tho governor turned and clasped
Reuben's hands In both his own. Tho
old man's eyes wore full of tears, and
his voice trembling as ho askod eag
erly,. "Is Tom allvo? Is Tom alive?"
"Yes," rcturnod tho governor, "not
only allvo, but hero. Ho camo with ma
today because It was to your town I
was coming."
Tho crowd had been quiet long
enough and now broke Into tumultuous
applause.
Down through tho nlslo another old
man was coming, gray, bent, his right
slecvo hanging empty. Making his
way through tho curious applauding
throng he reached tho platform, while
tho governor, still holding Reuben's
hand, stepped forward to meet him.
Ono look into each other's eyes, and
tho two old comrades clasped bands
with a cry of "Rouben!" "Tom!" Then
their trembling voices failed and their
eyes overflowed.
Samantha laid a timid fiand on that
of her neighbor.
"I'm afraid father can't stand It,"
sho said anxiously. "I must go and get
him."
Shouldering her way to tho plat
form, sho caught Reubon'o coat. "Como,
fathor," sho said. "You and Mr. Duf
flold como outsldo with me. I'm 'frald
you can't stand it." And so, led. by
Samantha, they passed out into tho
sunlight.
