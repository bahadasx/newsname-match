me; another reason
for oiag to Wilson was my' desire,
to have a little chat with Mr. IStt
Scherrnerhorn concerning an incident
which happened in Trego county
before there was any such county on
the map of Kansas, in which incid
ent he had a leading part, or at least
an interesting part. I had that- lit
tle chat' all -right, - and-.tt-was quite'
satisfactory, but left a desire for
more particulars, local history being
one of the hobbies I ride sometimes.
I went down to Wilson on the Day
light Limited, which owing to its
moderate sp'eed, should never ba cy
ed-a "jitney. "v Hoistein, or Jersey
In fact, the scrubbiest scrub ''dagie'
heifer could beat it getting ar&und
the hills and not half try. But then,
for all these slurs on tha U. P. safety
first, we arrived all right and;on time,
and it has long been considered an
.unkind act to find fault ' with the
bridge that carries one safely across,
and so let us give the Limited her
just dues. , - -" '
Never before iu all my life have
seen so many acres of green, growing
wheat in so short a time as I saw on
that ..80-mile ride to Wilson, and
nearly atr of tt had 'th&tbum-peremeY-
ald hue which foretells a wonderful
activity in the automobile, sloops
barring the' usual exigencies ot-Kan-
-saa crop weather".' To be sure.'.tbe
"stubbled-ioj' fields and the hailed-
ouc, -volunteer patches of wheat , do
not -promise so ireti,; but -where-: the
seed bed had ,ben properly ,paeprd
wra pt ixrpvrwir i tfi . gwt 'a.vt waia
not be better. South, of Wilsaa" there
were complaints ' of "damago-by the
Hessian fly and some fields' were be
ing plowed up and seeded to other
crop. By the- way. this fly is a Get4-
man importation.- He came in trie
forage w hich was brought over here
to feed the horses of t ie Hessian
soldiers which old King George- lured
to fight his rebellious subjects about
140 years ago; but that is no fault of
our thousands of loval German neigh
bors. It is one of the penalties of
war our war for independence.
All along the line, hundreds of
brown bleaching strawstactcs. (some
of them two years eld), contrasted
strangely with the deep green of the
fields. -;Thet hard-winder. , of 191142
taught farmers '-t'o ' sa ve their ''straw
for feed. In only two or three places
were any burnt stack bottoms to be
seen. There should be some way to
make the unused straw serve as a
substitute for wood fibre, and thus
economize and conserve great resour
ces. Another item of waste was in
dicated by two xt three headers
which seemed to be standing right
where the last day's work left them
last harvest. I understand the price
of headers has risen along with other
items in the high cost of making a
living high enough to take the pro
fit off several acres of good wheat.
- White iu Wilson I stepped into tha
power bouse of the municipal elec
tric light plant. was interested if
seeing' the St. Mary's engines.' but
another reason was the fact that the
plans tor that plant were-drawn right
here n this table wbere these Unas
are being written.- That happened
in the autumn of 1P09, when Geo. - P.
Taylor, C. E , of Stockton, was super
intending the installation .of our
water and light plants. Wilson
streets seem narrow in contrast with
ours and their light poles are not in
the middle of the street. Their tower
is higher than ours and they keep
6ne big light aWihe peak. " When we
get our additional machinery install
ed I hope we may have our tower
lights restored.
For many years Mie odor of print
er's ink has had a great sort of pull
of me and so it was only natural that
I should find my way into the sanc
tum of Editor Baker, of the Wilson
World. He gets out a good newsy
paper, and Mr. Will Austin a high
school senior, runs a good high school
column in it.
Last, but not least, my visit at
Wilson was Chelny . concerned with
the schools of .that - to wtt.T.mojo, par
