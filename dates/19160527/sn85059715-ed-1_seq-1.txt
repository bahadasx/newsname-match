LABORING MEN FAVOR
JUDGE IRA ROBINSON
FOR NEXT GOVERNOR
President Huggins of the State
Federation TeHs Why .They
Are for Robinson.
WHEELING, May 27.?Charles J.
Hugglna, president of the mate fed
eration of labor, declares that a vei7
large majority of the member! of tho
union labor organizations In West
Virginia prefers Judge Ira B. Robln
?on for governor to A. A. Lilly. Thl?
declaration comes from President
Huggins In reply to statements made
by L. V. Barton, former state labor
commissioner. Along this line. Pres
ident Huggins says:
First, he says that the workmen's
compensation bureau Is oxtravagunt
ly conducted, and thereupon be gives
some figures which answer his own
charge. He says the state spends
180,000 per year on the workmen's
compensation bureau, and that some
thing over 26,000 accidents per year
are reported. In other words, for
about <3.10 per caso tho workmen's
compensation bureau Investigates, re
ports on and adjudicates all the cas
ualty clalfns In the state. Nearly
every case requires a special Investi
gation and report. Some require
two or more investigations. I hap
pen to know one inspector of the
workmen's compensation bureau
right In Wheeling who frequently
works sixteen hourse per day on his
Investigations and reports. For any
one to say that investigation, report
and adjudication of claims at a cost
of $3.10 per case Is extravagant. Is a
ridiculous absurdity. Yet that Is
what Mr. Barton alleges In his let
ter.
Then Mr. Barton goes on In hli
letter to tell what General Lilly will
do to Improve the workmen's com
pensation bureau, and to Improve
the law, if he becomes governor.
Qod help the workmen's compensa
tion law If "Abe" Lilly and his
bunch get Into power. The work
lngmen of the state had to flght for
the workmen's compensation law,
and every Inch of the way they had
to flght the very men who are now
backing Abe Lilly for governor. The
i opposition to the workmen's com
pensation lnw did not come from the
manufacturers of northern West Vir
ginia, but from the organized coal
operators, headed by Taylor Vinson,
and financed by such men as Mo
,Kell and Huston, the very men who
are directing Lilly's campaign for
governor. The working men remem
ber, too, that these men were Influen
tial enough In the legislature to' mu
tilate the first law, passed In 1913
and to force a limit on the assess^
ments that made it' impossible to col
lect from the coal companies their
full and equitable casualty charge.
They know, too, that when, in 1916
thfty sought to amend the law, to
I make it equitable, they again had
to flght the coal operators who are
now backing Lilly.
The working men of West Virginia,
moreover, know another thing. That
I is. In a famous case the martial law
case arising from the Cabltl Creek
strike, Judge Ira E. Robinson, In an
atmosphere absolutely loaded with
hate and opposition to the striking
miners, had the courage and honesty
alone to resist the demand of the coal
operators, and to render a dissenting
opinion, vindicating the constitution
al rights of American citliens; that
this opinion practically took fifty
miners and sympathizers out of the
Jails to which they had been sent
Jy drum-head court-martials; that
this opinion of Judge Robinson was
commended in the senate of the
United States, and has been uni
versally accepted; while on the other
.. \.A- LilIy went before the
Investigating commission appointed
by the United States Senate and spent
days trying to Justify the martial law
procedures.
These are some of the things which
the working men of this seotlon
Know and they are reason* why the
yery largo majority of them, wi th
ou' regard to party, prefer Judge
AA A?,LI,ly '<"? governor.
From Judge Robinson we expect
friendly and fair treatment. From
Lilly, we expect nothing.
