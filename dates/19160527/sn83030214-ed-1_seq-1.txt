Britain and From e,
Thc government of thc United States . can no longer tol
eratc thc wrongs whieh citizens of thc United States have suffcrcd
and enminue to suffer through these methods
To submit to a lawless practice of this character would open the
tioot to rcpeated violations of international law hy thc hclligcrcnt
powers on thc ground of military necessity, of whieh the violator
would hc the sole judge.
Mamfestly a neutral nation (.innot permit its rights on the high
4f .s tn ho determined hy belligerents. The rights of neutrals arc as
sat red as thc rights of belligerents and must bc as strictly obscrved.
Thc government of thc United States . . . expects the pres?
ent practice, .-if thc British and French authoritics in the treatment
of mails from or to thc United States to ccase, and belligerent rights,
as exerciscd, to conform to thc principle govcrning the passage of
mail matter and to the r:rogni/ed practice of nations.
Only a radical ehangc in thc present British and l'rench policy,
restoring to thc United States its full tight-. as a neutral power, will
satisfy this government.
