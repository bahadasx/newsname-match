Body of Charles
Stoltz, 19, Found
In Ohio River
Charles .StolU. 19-year-old son of
Dr. Charles Stoltz. LZO X. Lafayette
st., wh has been missing since Nov.
11. 1'JlZ, was found in the Ohio
river at Jeffersonville Friday morn
in?, according to word received here
I by Dr. Charles Terry Friday after
noon. The body apparently had
been in the water for several
months.
The boy suddenly disappeared
from the state sanitarium at Madi
son. Ind., where he had been put
under the care of Dr. Milligan, for
merly of this city, a personal friend
of Dr. Stoltz. He ran away ff-m
the institution on Nov. 11 and no
trace of him could be found. It is
supposed that the lad ended his own
life immediately after leaving the
sanitarium.
According to the word received
from Dr. Milliwatt the body was In
such a bad state of decomposition
that it was impossible to identify
it by any characteristics. The only
means of identification was a tie
bearing the name C. Stoltz, and a
watch which corresponds in descrip
tion to the one carried by the boy.
The numbers on the watch are the
same as those on record at the
Mayr jewelry store, where it was
purchased.
A few years ago when he was in his
third year in high school, the boy
ran away from home and nothing
was heard from him until he was
located in Des Moines, where he was
seen by H. I. Pulfer. formerly of
this city, who was living there. Tie
was taken to a private sanitarium
at Lake Heneva and later went to
Madison.
Dr. Stoltz and A. M. Kussell left
for Jeffersonville Friday niht to
take charKe of the funeral.

Suffrage Parrot
Master of Profanity
lDternatioii.il News Service:
CHICAGO, May 27. Some wretch
in masculine form played a dastard
ly joke on the suffragists here.
For days the suffragists have
been drilling- a poll parrot to shriek
their propaganda. Poll made much
progress.
"Fine!" said his teachers. "Just
like a man, he says what you tell
him."
Then the blow- came. During a
meeting of the women, poll let rip
a stream of profanity with such
fluency and force that a sailor might
have heard and marvelled. And in
stead of "votes for women," poll
ejaculated "Votes: Ha! Ha Votes!
Ha! Ha!"

Ititern.itioml News Service:
NEW YORK. May 27. Within
one week from the time he was
placed on trial for the murder of
his millionaire father-in-law, John
K. Peck. Dr. Arthur Warren Waite
is expected to know the fate that
the jury will mete out to him.
All the evidence is in, but that
of the prosecution's alienists, who
will take the stand to combat the
defense's testimony that Waite is an
"ego maniac," a "moral imbecile"
and an ' 'mmoral monster."
A report is in circulation that the
prosecution has a witness whose
identity Is closely guarded, who will
testify that Waite told his amazing
and sensational story of his life of
crime in the hope that the jury
would find him insane.
The case may po to the jury to
night. Little time will be devoted
by counsel to summing up.
Waite's w ife was In the court -r

"Committee of 60" Working
to Secure Planks in AH
Party Platforms.
Internntionnl News Service:
CHICAGO. May 27. National pro
hibition today cast its hat into the
rin of national politics.
Through circulars sent out from
lure and from headquarters in New
York, the "committee of 60 on ra
tional prohibition" announces its in
tention to force, if possible, all three
parties to put a prohibition plank in
its platform this year. The commit
tee is composed largely of educators
and men who have been active in
fighting the liquor traffic. It is not,
however, as yet associated with the
national prohibition party.
Initial efforts are being directed
toward forming a "live-million club"
for suppression of the trattic. Al
ready, according to the circulars,
one million names have been obtain
ed to demand prohibition.
David is'tarr Jordan, chancellor of
Leland Stanford university, is hon
orary president of the committee.
Daniel A. Polling of Boston is active
head. Among its members are Prof.
Jrving Fisher of Yale; Luther Bur
bank, Prof. Edward A. Ross of the
university of Wisconsin; Warren S.
Stone, head of the Brotherhood o
Locomotive Fngineeis; William Al
ien White, editor, of Emporia, Kan.;
former Gov. Hanly of Indiana; for
mer Gov. Van Sant of Minnesota;
Bishop William M. Hell of Los An
geles, and many others.
Failing to have at least one party
enter a prohibition plank the com
mittee will wield its influence inde
pendent of party politics.
The advent of the committee into
the national situation gave candi
date's managers already on the
ground here much food for thought
today. It was the principal topic of
conversation along "candidates'
rcw."
Chairman Charles D. Hille has
remained iniccessibl? to reporters
and politicians alike since his ar
rival here. He did not register at
his hotel, his telephone remained un
answered. There was a disposition
on the part of some of the "rail
birds" to make mystery of his seclu
sion. There was a lull in the fervid pro
motion of campaigns today. Mana

WASHINGTON, May 27. Either
Sherman of Illinois, or Cummins of
Iowa, is expected here to be the
candidate about whom the "favorite
son" delegates will be asked to rally
at Chicago. Former Sen. Root of
New York, who was expected to
prove a real attraction along- this
line, now is said to be out of it.
Canvass of the middle western
delegates has shown, republican
leaders here say, that they cannot
throw any of their support to Root.
Roth Sherman and Cummins are
recognized as progressives and they
will be backed as the men who have
a real righting chance against either
Justice Hughes or Col. Roosevelt.. If
Ilughei; can be prevented from run
ning olf with the nomination in the
early balloting, leaders still on the
ground hero say, then either Sher
man or Cummins will have an excel
lent opportunity of annexing the
prize.
The Hughes followers, however,
continue extremely confident. They
openly assert that the increase of
the Roosevelt strength, so very no
ticeable during the last week, had
bettered the strategic position of the
justice. It will rally to hi3 support,

Gerard is quoted as saying:
"Xow that concord exists between
Germany and the United states fol
lowing the submarine negotiations,
the United States occupies an abso

the way; it might be many months
in coming, or might be only weeks."
It is widely reported that Col. K.
M. House, known as the "personal
envoy of Fres't Wilson," might make
another trip to Europe soon, coming
to Berlin on his round of visits, but
there is no (tTicial confirmation of
the report here. In this connection
however, there is a growing belief
that if Col. House should come
