NEW YORK, May 27.—Dr.
Arthur Warren Waite, was
this afternoon found guilty of
I murder in the first degree for
the poisoning of his millionaire
father-in-law, John E. Peck, of
,Grand Rapids, Mich.
The jury which considered
Jfwaite's case retired at 1:23
reported its verdict at
^2:45 p. m.
According to the two alienists who
testified for Waite, he is an "ego
map lac" and can be otherwise char
acterized as a "moral imbecile," a
"moral idiot" or a "mor*Jly insane
person." They agreed that he is ab
solutely without feeling or emotion.
"And would you hesitate to lock
Dr. Waite up in an asylum?" was the
parting question on examination of
tr. Diefendorf.
"X would not," he responded. I
A Would lock him up and keep him
locked up for the rest of his life. He
Is an unmoral monster."
One of the witnesses the state will
place on the stand today is an inmate
in the Tombs. He will give testimony
on Dr. Waite/s behavior there, pos
sibly in support of the state's conten
tion that the defendent is now sham-

The most surprising feature of the
testimony yesterday was the telling

The United Press learned this from

was trying to prove to the Jury that
his life should be taken. Dr. Waite
was more disappointed at his failure
to charm her than he was at any of
the evidence.
Case to the Jury.
NSW YORK, May 27.—Dr. Arfhnr
Warren Waite, arob-poisoner, on trial
lor the murder of his father-in-law,
John E. Peck, probably will know his
fate within a few hours. Justice
Shearrt began his charge to the Jury
early this afternoon after state and
defense had summed up with brief
closing arguments to the Jury.
Gazing steadily at Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Brothers, Waite heard
himself denounced as a cruel, ouxt
ning murderer and without a trace
of emotion heard Brothers demand
that lie be sent to the electric chair.
Hi» attitude 'wm« no different when
Attorney Due 11, in his defense^ 'begged
the Jury not to vote the death verdict
for a man "born a criminal."
lively speculation on the Jury's
deliberations flew about the court
room as Justice Shewn began hk»
closing address. An interrogation
put by Juror Josepfh Trent to one of
the three state's alienists who de
clared Waite sane, aroused much
comment Trent asked whether the
alienist could positively declare the
dentist sane, in view of his demeanor
on the witness stand, his question ln
dteating that Waite's nonchalant ap
pearance had made considerable im
pression upon at least a portion of
the Jury.
Three alienists introduced by the
state today declared positively their
belief that Dr. Waite was sane when
he killed his wife's parents and that
he is sane now. They admitted that
he was not normal and classified him
as a "born criminal."
This latter admission was instant
ly seized upon by Walte's counsel in
closing argument in support of his
plea to save the dentist from the
electric chair. He begged the Jury
not to vote the death penalty but to
send Waite to the insane asylum for
life.
Ridiculing the plea of insanity,
Assistant District Attorney Brothers
recalled Harry K. Thaw's eeoape
from Matteawan in urging the death

NEW COMMERCIAL TREATY
WITH CZAR OF RUSSIA
statesman of the czar's empire, in an
exclusive interview with the United
Press, clearly stated what he be
lieves the Russian attitude will be
toward the new commercial treaty
he understands Ambassador Francis
is instructed to negotiate.
The former premier was very
much in earnest throughout the dis
cussion and evidently prompted by
the desire for a better mutual under
standing between the two countries.
He made it plain, however, that Rus
sia will consider no treaty in which
the question of treatment of the Jews
is r&iB6{L

record is proof of this. I admire
America. I welcome American co
operation in building up our indus
tries and our railways and in opening
np the vast resources of raw mater
ial* of every sort.
"Before the war, Germany made
no special demands upon Russia- She
was too keen for that. But having
ulterior motives, she scattered the
wildest stories against Russia, mak
ing trouble and meanwhile virtually
monopolizing trade.
"Americans ought to realize that

to Columbus, N. May 27.)—Found
on the body of Cande'ario Cervantes,
bandit killed by Amejican troops on
Thursday, was a proclamation ad
dressed to the members of the Car
ranza army, calling on them to riBe
against the American invader. The
tone of this document is very bitter
toward the United States and justi
fies the declaration of General Per

the United States has disposed of one
of the most dangerous of the bandits
who infested Mexico. Cervantes in
influence was second only to Villa

The proclamation calleti on all

•PARIS, May 27.—iFrenoh troops re
oaptured a large part of the village of
Cumleres, nine miles northwest of
Vemfrm In heavy fighting last night,
the war office announced today.
Oesplts the most desperate oount
er attacks, the Frenoh retained pos
session of the eastern part of the vil
lage as we4l as several German
trenches In the northwest.
The French counter attack waa
launched from the grove between
Cumleres and the we«t bank of the
Meuse. After pressing forward Into
this wood In grenade fighting Thurs
day, the French corrwranders massed
detachments there yesterday and last
night threw the forees against the
Germans who had occupied Cumleres
earlier In the week.
At the same time another French
force attacked In the Cur- -eres woods,
northwest of the village, oapturing
German trenches. The Germans coun
ter attacked with great fury, but
when the latest dispatches were filed
to the war office the French were still
holding the eastern portion of Cumi
eres, three quarters or a mile from
the Meuee.
East of Hill 304 Frenoh grenadiers
made some progress during the night.
On the east bank of the Meuse, the
Germans attacked French trenches
near Fort Douaumont, but were com
pletely repulsed. Artillery was very
active on the northern front of Ver
dun last night.'
GENERAL GALLIENI DEAD.
PARIS, May 27.—General Gallienl,
untn recently French minister of war
and popularly known as the "saviour
of Paris" died today at Versailles,
following an operation for kidney
trouble.
Gallienl, a veteran of the Franco.
Prussian war, was one of the most
briHiant members of the French gen
eral staff. His d^rlt'.a r/-eke against
the Germans early In the war r.
only had much to do with saving
Paris from capture by the kaiser's
armies, b\it marked a turning point
-in .the European struggle.
Advancing swiftly toward the
French capital, the Germans had
reached the northern outskirts when
General Manoury attacked the Ger
man flank under Von Kluck. The
Germans were reinforced and Manoury
In desperation appealed to General
Gallienl who had been appointed mili
tary governor of Paris only a few
days before.
Gallienl moved swiftly. By tele
phone he requisitioned every taxicab
in Paris, loaded them with Zouaves
from Tunis who had Just reached
Paris and sent them dashing out to
Manouri's aid. Gallieni's taxicab army
saved the day. The Germans were
then rolFed back and beaten at the
Marne.
General Gallenl was born in 1849
and was of slender, wiry build. He
saw service and won honors in the
French colonial possessions in Africa.
He reached the age limit several
years ago, but his services were
specially extended. He became minis
ter of war October 29, 1915, and was
succeeded by General Roques Marcl
15, 1916, resigning on account of .ill
health. He underwent an operation
for kidney trouble May 18.
