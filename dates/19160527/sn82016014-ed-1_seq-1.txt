DR.VAITE FOUND
GUILTY BY JURY
THIS AFTERNOON
Charged With Murder of Father-in-law
in Michigan.
Alienists Disagree on State of
Defendant's Mentality.
NEVER WAS INSANE, SAYS ONE
Prisoner Resigned and Noncha
lant Throughout Ordeal.
Knew What He Was Doing
When He Murdered.
New York. May 27. Ir. Arthur
Warren Waite was today found
guilty of the murder of his father-in-law.
.John K. Ieek. of Grand
ISapicis, Mich.
He Is Sane.
That Dr. Waite is sane now and was
sane at the time he poisoned his mil
lionaire father-in-law. Dr. Smith Jel
liffe. alienist for the state, declared
on the witness stand today. Dr. Jel
liffe said he reached his decision after
talking with the poisoner and examin
ing him as to his mental soundness.
The prosecution in the Waite mur
der trial took up the task of contra
dicting evidence introduced by the de
fense to prove that the young dentist
was insane when he committed the
crime the jury had heard him vividly
describe.
Poisoner Unconcerned.
Following the taking of testimony
this morning Assistant District Attor
ney Brothers,-for the prosecution, be
gan his address to the jury.
Dr. Waite entered the court room
with the same apparently resigned,
nonchalant manner that has charac
terized him since the trial started.
The prosecution began its rebuttal
of the testimony of the defense bear
ing upon Waite's alleged imbecility
and idiocy by placing- on the witness
stand a neurologist. Dr. Smith Ely
.Telliffe of New York. He testified
that the prisoner showed no signs of
defective intelligence'.
"He appeared as the average man
of his earlv life and environment,"
said Dr. Jelliffe.
"My belief is that he was an aver
age man, somewhat superficial, in
clined to be snobbish, and of no great
intellectual attainment.
Kane When Ho Killed Peck.
"In my opinion he was sane. I be
lieve he knew the nature of the crime
he committed and was fully aware of
all phases of it. He had sufficient
mentality to appreciate his acts, lie
was sane when he killed Peck."
"Do you consider Waite a normal
man?" asked W. R. Deuel, the pris
oner's counsel.
"That question cannot be answered."
replied Dr. Jelliffe. "He is a
criminal with a mind. He differs
from the average man in terms of
psychology. His demeanor was not
like the normal average man, but he
has a trait that a criminal of that
tpe would show."
Dr. William Mabon also testified f.ir
the prosecution saying he found no
disturbance of Dr. Waite's nervous
system. On some occasions when he
examined Waite he found the prisoner
made an effort to give false answers.
Smile Was for Purpose.
"What is your conclusion about in
sanity?" asked Assistant - District At
torney Brothers.
"That he was sane," said the wit
ness. "Waite is as normal a man of his
type can be. He had control of him
self and knew what he was doing."
Asked if he noticed that . Waite
smiled while on the witness stand, he
said the prisoner smiled while he was
examined by the alienist.
"I consider that he chose that, at
titude for a purpose," added the alien
ist. "I think he had trained himself
. for years to be pleasant to everybody,
and was able to tell a story of the
crime on the stand with the same
manner that he would have told any
story of simple life."

They Think He May Throw His
Strength to Root.
Washington, May 27. Republican
leaders in congress conceded today
Colonel Roosevelt will be able to con
trol the nomination for president by
the Republican national convention, if
he fails to nominate himself.
They declared the former president
could cause the nomination of either
Root, Hughes, Burton, Sherman or
Fairbanks, but were inclined to be

other. Should Colonel Roosevelt se
lect Root, they said, he would have
no difficulty whatever in "coming
back" himself in 1920.
It was asserted that the delegates to
the convention are hand picked but
that while they will be free to vote
for any man, there was a mental res
ervation understood they would not
return to Roosevelt.
Standpatters to Dominate.
The convention will be dominated.
it was declared, by "standpatters," but
a Progressive platform has been de
cided on in deference to the views of
Colonel Roosevelt. There was notice
able today a distinct desire on the part
of all factions at the capital to esti
mate Colonel Roosevelt at his true
value and not to minimize his strength
with the rank and file of the party.
This consideration for the wishes of
the former president was particularly
noticeable in the camps of the favorite
sons, who have begun to court him in
the hope, it was said, that he may
cast his eyes their way if the nomina
tion does not go to him and he refuses
to let Justice Hughes be named.

Menacing Letters From Wnrt

MUST HAVE CO-OPERATION
Provisioning Large Cities Is a
Difficult Task.
Two Poor Crop Years Add to
Predicament.
(BY THE NEW YORK SOT.)
Amsterdam, May 27. According to
Berlin advices, the president of the
food supply board, Herr von Botocki,
warned the reichstag not to expect
any sudden change or improvement of
conditions. He added that great dif
ficulties axe arising out of the rela
tions of the federal states.
"From Wurttemburg," he is quoted
as .saying, "menacing letters have
reached me protesting against the
'sucking dry' of Wurttemburg by
Prussia. Without the ready co-operation
of the authorities of the federal
states and the entire population, my
work cannot be successful.
"The army must first be provided
for and only then can the civil popu
lation be considered. The most diffi
cult task will be the provisioning of
the large towns. Whether this pro
visioning will be more or less difficult
depends on the result of the harvest
Egg Famine in Berlin.
"It should not be forgotten that the
bad harvest of 1914 and the still worse
one of last year is the cause of the
situation which we deplore today."
A Berlin dispatch quotes the Lokal
Anzeiger as saying that for the last
few days there has been a consider-
able shortage of eggs in Berlin and
its suburbs.
An official communication to the
press also is quoted, calling on the
people to restrict the consumption of
meat so that sufficient cattle for
slaughter and milking may be saved
for the spring.

made his home, will testify against
him, attorneys for the state have de
clared. Damaging evidence was en
tered yesterday by Alvah Henson, the
19 year old cronie of Sweet. Lawyers
do not expect the case to end before
the middle part of next week.
Witnesses for the state testified that
Sweet acted normally when he arrived
at the place where the youne woman
was found and helped lift the body
into a wagon to carry it to the inquest.
Dr. W. C. Brownell, of Moscow. Kan..
testified he had examined Miss Byers'
body after the murder and to his best
judgment she had been attacked.
G. K. Watson, chemist of the Uni
versity of Kansas, was called to the
stand to testify to evidence taken
from the girl's body by Dr. Brownell,
tending to prove she had been rav
ished. Did Not Subpoena Capper.
Pearl Slemp, one of Miss Byers' pu
pils, testified she heard screams in the
vicinity of the murder about the time
the deed was supposed to have been
committed. She declared she was on
horseback after cattle when the cries
were heard.
The plan to subpoena Governor
Capper in the case and have him pro
duce the telegram alleged to have
been sent him by7 County Attorney
Stubbs saying developments indicated
Sweet to be innocent, was abandoned
by the defense. Stubbs was cross
examined on the same issue but the

Demands Voice of Labor Be In

President of Unions' Federa
tion Addresses Peace League.
Washington, D. C, May. 27. Labor
has borne most of the burdens grow
ing out of wars in the past, with little
to say in regard to the declaring of
wars or their conduct, and in the
peace of the future labor must have
an increasing voice, Samuel Gompers,
president of the American Federation
of Labor, declared in an address here
at the first annual assemblage of the
League to Enforce Peace.
Mr. Gompers outlined five prin
ciples which he declared "represent
not only the international program for
which labor will work in the future,
but for which labor has been contend
ing through the years." These prin
ciples, be said, are as follows:
Gompers' Five Principles.
"1. It must be a program under
which the military forces of the world
will be reduced from the dictation
of arbitrary autocracy and absolute
secret diplomacy and dedicated to the
maintenance of a higher standard of
morals, law and justice; a program
that will o safeguard the use of mili
tary power that it cannot be used by
the reactionary forces of privileges, in
imperialistic aggression.
"2. It must be a program elastic
enough to admit of those fundamen
tal changes that the growing life of
the world makes inevitable. Labor
will oppose any federation of nations
so organized that the more powerful
nations can use the machinery to
maintain the status quo against the
demands for change made in the in
terest of democracy and larger oppor
tunity for the masses.
Must Protect Small Nations.
"3. It must be a program under
which the small nation, as well as the
large nation, will have a free hand in
every just and individual develop
ment; a program that will make it im
possible for a few strong nations to
dictate the policies and development

will bear on the war and will lead to
discussion of the fundamentals the
president believes should underlie
world peace.

international police force is looked
upon by the president as a possible
means of minimizing the danger of
war. It is understood that tonight he
will carefully set forth his views on
the question-.
There were renewed evidences to
day that the president is deeply in

TO RESTRICT WAR
Peace League Speakers Urge
Necessity of World TribunaL
U. S. Must Be in It, Says Sec
retary of War Baker.
Washington, May 27. Secretary of
War Newton D. Baker told the league
to enforce peace in session here that
whn the war is over, Europe's people
will demand preservation. He says
such wars as the present will no long
er be tolerated. If the United States
refuses to join hands with nations
to preserv peace, he state, it will be
left outside the circles formed by the
nations of the world to preserve peace.
H said:
"There has come a situation in the
world in which, whether we want to
or whether we do not. whether it is
good business or just ordinary ideal
ism, we are obliged to take a plan
etary view of the advent of the human
race.
"An intimate and intricate system
of xchange and interchange between
nations is going to rise as the voice
of the people in favor of some such
expression of the popular conscience
of the continent of Europe as is de
sired by the league for the enforce
ment of peace.
Xj. S. Must Be In.
"Now suppose thev get un such a
league. Suppose Europe asserts her
self and determines to have that sort
i r " . u
of regulation of international relati
and we are not in it. What will then
be the relation we bear to the rest of
the world? Their intimacy without
our being in partnership will some day
become confusing to us. And if we
now. in the dominant moral position
in the world, decline to join hands
with the circle that is quite certainly
destined to be formed by the nations
of the world for the preservation of
peace, they will form that circle and
we will be on the outside of it."
At a special meeting of the league
a campaign to raise 1300,000 before
tonight was announced. Forty thou
sand dollars had been subscribed. The
fund will be used in carrying on the
league's propaganda. Among those at

Former President Will Be for
T. R. If He Wins.
Report That Few Western
Moosere Will "Wander."
Washington, May 27. If Colonel
Roosevelt wins the Chicago conven
tion, William Howard Taft will be for
him. This news came to Republican
leaders here today from a source close
to both Roosevelt and Taft. The lat
I ter, in the city for the League to En
! force Peace meeting, would not give
confirmation.
He would only chuckle and shake
his head when asked about the report.
Finally, between chortles, he said:
"Why should I comment on such a
violent hypothesis V
With this, however, came a report
that a number of western delegates to
the Progressive convention do not in
tend to follow Roosevelt in any path
he may select. Should he endeavor t
indorse a candidate of the conserva
tive type, or should he approve & plat
form in which the "social justice"
planks of 1912 have only an unimpor
tant place if any at all, they intend to
name a candidate of their own and
make an independent fight.

POLLY LAUGHS AT
SUFFS; SEND HER
BACK TO OWNER
Chicago, May 27. There will be no
green and yellow parrot in the suf
frage parade here on June 7. Polly
did not behave and she is back in tha
bird store from which she came. Pa
rade headquarters were opened yes
terday and the parrot, which had been
named "Polly Votes," was there. It
had been announced that the parrot
was to be taught to talk for votes and
would be official barker in the parade.
The bird store man assured the com
mittee that the parrot did not swear,
but the day was opened by a recital
of all the swearwords that Polly knew.
The bird refused to learn the official
slogan. "Polly votes." but would only
say "Votes" and would follow it with
derisive laughter. She stole tha
beauty patch off on suffragist's
cheek, bit and scratched and behaved
so undignifiedly that lie was aaac
back to her owner .
