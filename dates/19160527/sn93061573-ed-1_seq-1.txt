STATE1C0NIÍENTI0N HONORS
UNION COUNTY DELEGATION
Juan J. iHiran, county clerk of Un
ion county will be one of the delega
' tkn of twelve prominent democrats
of the stale to attend the Naional
Democratic Convention in St. Louis.
Duran was named a member of !
the delegation by the State Conven
tion at Albuquerque. Wednesday,
and the loyal suport he received
from the delegation from other
counties is a fair suggestion of the
popularity of Mr. Duran as well as
a recognition of the Democratic
strength of Union county. , '
Tho State Convention was called
to order Wednesday morning bv
Senator Barth, who made an extend

ed speech upon local and national
affairs which wiw received will.
ringing cheers.
While it was originally announced
that the convention would meet at
10 o'clock in the morning, this hour
was later changed to o'clock in the
afternoon, anil it. was more than a
half hour later still when Slate
Chairman X. II. Laughlin moulded
the platform and called the conven
tion to order. 'The aniiounceinenl
that Senator Itarth had I u seert-
ed by the central committee for
temporary chairman was enthusias
tically cheered and the choice of the
committee was ratified without op
position. Mr. Barlli's keynote speech was
for the most part a review of tin
record of the present national ad
ministration and a warm defense of
President Wilson's policies. The on
ly issue in the campaign that is
about to begin, he declared, is the
republican desire lor ollice. The
republican party, he said, is sub
siding only on the memory 'of Ab
raham Lincoln, and is solely a party
of opposition an opposition, he as
serted, which in many instances had
bordered close on disloyally to the
couutry and the Hag.
The republicans, said Mr. Barth,
are a party of plenty and prosperi
ty for the plutocrat and panic and
pauperism for the people. He refer
red to fromer President Roosevelt
as having wielded a big stick in om
hand and a fountain pen in the oth
er, and the one. be said was ns dan-
gerous to his friends as the other'
was to his enemies. '
Touching on the nueslion of ore
paredness, Mr. Harth declared that !
forty years of republican rule had
en me country wholly unprepared
to defend itself against the most, in- :
significant foe, and he said that lheirv
orators are now upbraiding the
president for failing to do in three
years what the republicans neglect
ed for forty years to do.
Tho greatest achievement of the
entire nrlndnisfrnf inn
,v.u(..v.., u.mivei, uiil :
Mr. Barth, was that the president

while preserving be national honor.
He stated that the matter of elect
ing delegates to the convention
which is to renominate Mr. Wilson
was a mere formality, "for," ho ex
claimed, "the people of the United
Slates have already nominated
Woodrow Wilson for president."
Closing his address, Mr. Barth
paid a high tribute to the adminis
tration of Governor McDonald in
stale affairs, declaring that the gov
ernor had been tried in the cruicible
and had been found to be "pure gold
and without alloy."
Perhaps the most remarkable
scene ever presented to a political
convention in the history of New
Mexico was Wednesday afternoon,
when, at the conclusion of an ex
ceptionally able speech In which he
had aroused his hearers to a high
pitch of enthusiasm, Assistant Sec
retary of tho Interior A. A. Jones !
saia:
"I wish, through tho delegates to
this convention to express my pro
found gratitude to the people of the
various counties of New Mexico for
the confidence they have expressed
in mo in the various resolutions of
endorsement of me that they have
THE
adopted. If I can further serve
tht people of New Mexico, you have
only to call on me. I will carry the
standard of democracy as far is I
am able to do."
With these words Mr. Jones sat
down. Immediately, as by an elec
trical impulse, the crowd of several
hundred that thronged the lower
floor of the national guard armory
broke into a wild tumult of cheer
ing. Hats were thrown in the air
and delegates rushed to the platform
to grasp Mr. Jones by the hand. As
he stood thus, leaning over and smil- all possible dispatch. Wednesday,

practically every man in the aud

hand struck up "Dixie." and a pro-ce-simi

DF.MOCRATS ACCOMPLISH MORE IX 4 YEARS TILAN REPUB
LICANS DID IX 40, SAYS FORMER REPUBLICAN
CABINET OFFICER
(From the Indianapolis News, April 20, 1910.)
Hon. Leslie M. Shaw, former Secretary of the Treasury, says:
"I have no hesitancy In admitting grave doubt whether the
Republican Party can, even if it should try, and also whether It
ought to try to defeat the party now in power upon an Issue of
excoriation because it has failed to accomplish in four years what
we failed to do in forty years. If we have a small and inadequate
army and navy, the Republican Party is 80 per cent responsible for
its inefficiency, for the Republican Party has been in power 80
per tent of the last half century. If our coast defenses are silly,
I submit it does not lie in the mouth of the Republican Party to
say much about it. Let the next administration be a business ad
ministration, and while preparing for peace let it also do what
we all agree should be done prepare for eventualities that may
ensue."
