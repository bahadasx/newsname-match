Civic Beauty.
In a number of cities sonme tine
results have followed a persistent
campaign by civic beauty clubs,
in the way of implrovement in the
_ looks of the streets and yards. In
stead of unsightly sidewalks and
premises there are now pretty
lawns and well kept sidewalks with
flowers here and there adding
toui'ches of color to the brilliant and
inviting green.
And the back yards were not
overlooked -they received atten
tion and were planted to fruit
trees, roses. vines and grass until
it is doubtful which is the most
attractive, the front or back.
It was some work to accomplish
this. Accounts says that it was
several years before the full coop
eration of the householders could
be secured and that prizes and
and other inducements were neces
sary at first to arouse interest. But
results were finally reached and
now, it is said. the pride the peo
ple take in their homes and the
beauty of their city is sufficien to
keep up the high standard reached.
The example set by these cities
has inspired similar improvements
in other cities and now civic beau
ty is receiving a great deal of at
tention throughout the land. E,'eni
where there is no organized move
to promote it. there are many indi
viduals who are setting examples
wihich, are influencing their neigh
bors to do likewise. and as a result
there are spots in all towns, big
and little, where pretty lawns and
well kept yards blossom, as it wer.e,
out of their environmuents and
draw admiring attention. - Ex.
