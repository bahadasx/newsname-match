French Lose Dead Man's
Hill, Sacrifice 40,000 Men
in Greatest of All Battles
30,000 Die at Douamont; Like a Battle of
Madmen in Miclst of Volcano Eruption
Countless Soldiers Died in Dark
Underground Caverns
BERLN, May 25—The giant
German "nut-cracker" is closing
in upon Verdun in the bloodiest
fighting in all history.
The right jaw has advanced
on a front of three miles in the
last 72 hours of the mad strug
gle northwest of the fori ress.
The French have evacuated the
entire Dead Man's hill position,
northwest of Verdun, afte: - sac
rificing more than a whole ,rmy
corps (40,000 men) in vain ef
forts to hold it.
Hill 304, cornerstone o the
French outer defense is now
held jointly by Germans and
French. Further slight ad anc
es for the Germans on either
side will force its surrender.
30,000 Die in Caverns
The left jaw of the crown
prince's great fighting machine
has reconquered entirely posi
tions surrendered to the French.
It is estimated here that 30,000
men died fighting in dark uader
ground caverns and about the
ruins of Fort Douamont in 72
hours without changing the bat
tle line in the slightest.
Denial was made here today of
French claims that Gen. Kivel

Italians Retire; But
Not Forced to Do So
ROME, May 23—The Italian
official report of today admits
the retirement of Italy's forces
'on their main lines of defense
between the Astico and B- enta
Rivers and in the Sugana Valley
in the Southern Tyrol.
The report explains that the
backward movement was made
not because of pressure that
could not be withstood, but for
military reasons studied out in
advance.
A hundred cannon to the mile,
along a front of twenty miles,
military experts say, forms the
unprecedent concentration i>eing
employed by the in
their present offensive. The
terrific resultant fire is gh on as
the reason the Italian Command
er-in-Chief thought it advisable
to with-draw his troops an con
solidate them in more advant
ageous positions for defense.

THE PA TRIOT
occupied the ruins of Fort Doua
mont. In the most desperate
nand-to-hand struggle of the
war, a French force did succeed
in capturing a redoubt and ruin
ed works connected with the
fort. The only French detach
ment that penetrated the ruins
was wiped out, not a single sur
vivor escaping.
Strewn about the southern
and western approaches to the
ruined fort are countless dead
and wounded. Since the French
attack began Sunday night the
fury of the battle has grown
more intense and there has
been no chance to reach the dy
ing.
West of the Meuse the French
are being steadily driven back
upon the Verdun forts. The
capture of Cumieres opens the
way for a German drive down
the Meuse upon Chattancourt
and Fort Bourrus.
French trenches south and
southwest of Fort Douamont
were captured in last night's
lghting around Verdun, the war
office announced this afternoon.
Three enemy counter-attacks
against the village of Cumieres
northwest of Verdun were repul
sed.
Salty Sentences Are
Handed Down Here
by Judge Langham
Three Men Who Pleaded Guilty
Were Sent to Penitentiary
and Work House
Three prisoners in the Indiana
jail pled guilty to char
ges placed against them in court

Ernest Hadden pled guilty to
