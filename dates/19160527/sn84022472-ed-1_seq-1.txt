' Calm During Summing Up
By Both Sides Early
x Verdict Looked For.
New York, May 27 That Dr.
Arthur Warren Walte, on trial
fpr the alleged murder of his
father-in-lawf ,John E. Peck, a
.wealthy manufacturer of Grand
. Rapid, Mich., will know t his
."fate late today was the belief
this afternoon, justice. Shearn
completed his charge' to the
jury at 1:20 o'clock.
Thetaking of testimony was
concluded this morning and
- both sides completed the sum-
,vyming up during the 1 forenoon.
' Justice Shearn immediately be-
N gan his address to the twelve
men who will decide the guilt
or, innocence of the young den
tist. As. the court finished his
instructions, the jury was lock
ed tip. ' ' ! ,
The prosecution in the 4.rial took utj
.
the conflicting evidence Introduced by
the defense to prove that the 1 young
' dentlzwas insane when he committed
the crime . the Jury had heard him
'vividly describe. It was expected that
this rebuttaj would be brief and that
the attorneys summing up and Jus
- tice Bhearn's charge would: be over
bo that the case might reach the jury
by sundown. . ; ;;
The district attorney called ihree
alienists, to court to state their belief
that Dr. Artthur Warren Waite is sane
and was shamming when he tried to.
make it appear that he was not men
tally responsible for his acts.
. - " The; defense rested at 6:18 las
night after finishing Waites testimony
Y and bringing two physicians to testify
to their belief that -the prisoner was
a. "moral Imbecile. V -. - .
Both admitted Walte knew what he
t was doing when he plotted Mr. Peck's
death but declared he had' no moral
sense.' .'..-.''"
Irv Smith' Jelliffe, ' neurologist,
was the first witness today for the
state. He' testified that he had de
termined from an examination' of
Waite that the . doctor . showed r
' signs of defective intelligence. .
"He appeared as the average loan
of his early ) life and. environment,"
said Dri Jelllffe. "My belief is that h
was an average man, somewhat su
, perflcial,' inclined to be snobbish and
of no great intellectual attainment.
In my opinion he was sane. I believe
he. knew the nature of the crime h
committed and was fully aware of all
phases of it. Be had sufficient men
tality to appreciate his acts He was
sane when he killed Peck."
"Do you consider Walte a normal
anan?' asked Walter R. Deuel, the
prisoner's counsel. "That' question
, cannot be answered," replied Dr. Jel
, liffe. "He is a criminal with a mind.
He differs from the average man in
terms of psychology, because of his
Wh-ole life" beings spent in living and
feeling."
, "Is Waite"s demeanor on the wit
' xi ess stand that of a. normal man?"
; "Not like the normal, average man.but
he has a trait -that a criminal of that
type would show," said Dr. Jelliffe.
Dr.' William Mahon also testified for
the prosecution, saying he found no
disturbances of Dr. Waite's nervous
system. On some occasions when he
examined Waite he found the prisoner
made an effort to give false answers.
This witness conclusion was that, at
the time he killed Peclc, Waite -was
sane and knew that he was doing
wrong; .Waite, he .added, is as nor
mal as a man of his type can ' be.
i He ijad control of himself and knew
what he was doing.
Asked if he noticed that Waite
!' smiled, while on the witness stand. Dr.
Mabon said the prisoner smiled while
he was being examined by the alien
ist - .
I considered that he chose that
attitude for a purpose,", added the
' alienist. "I think he had trained
' himself for years to be pleasant to
every bod y. . ' '
Dr. Menas Gregory, of .Sellevue
Hospital, called as a witness for" the
prosecution, said he had examined
Waite in that hospital and conclud
ed that he was sane; that' he, was
sane when he killed Mr. Pecle and
that he knew what he was doing was
wrong. .- .
" Cross-examined by Mr Deuel, . Mr.
Gregory said he 'believed . Waite was
posing when he assumed indifference
while telling his own- story of the
murders.
It was then announced that both
sides rested, i . Mr. Deuel began to.
sum up for the defense. ' He said he
did not think the Jurors would be
lieve that Waite- was sane.
"Can a man who lived as he lived
. and did as he did have any moral
sense whatsoever ?" asked , the attor
ney. "Is there anything in his life's
story to ehowi he ever had "a moral
sense and lost it? No."

Yale Students As Witnesses
Disprove Charge of Reck
less Driving.
-Max Blumberg of 754 Myrtle1 avenue,
son of Bernard Blumberg, well known
Wall street shoe merchant, was this
morning acquitted in the Milford town
court Aipon charges of reckless driv
ing. x ,
The -acquittal came as the result , of
a mass of evidence introduced in Mr.
Blumberg"s favor and was clinched in
the mind of the court by a party of
Yale students whose sense . of right
and wrong caused them to voluntarily
appear in court to the surprise of both
prosecution and defense to admit that
they had seen the accident. j
The arrest of Blumberg by the Mil
ford authorities and 'today's trial was
the result of an , accident which oc
crred on the Milford turnpike early on
the morning of May 14, when Blumberg-
and a party of friends returning
from New Haven suddenly ran down
Charles Anderson of Brooks street,
Bridgeport. A driving rain storm with
additional confusion resulting from
headlights of two automobiles caused!
Anderson to step in front of Blum
berg's car. In the Bridgeport hospital
where he was taken by the owner of
the car"Which struck him, it is said to
day that he will recover although one
leg ' has been broken and several ribs
were crushed.
Donald A. Quailes, ; of Van Buren,
Ark., senior in Yale, sprung a surprise
at' the trial when he took the witness
stand and fullv exonerated Blumberer.
Quailes, with three other students. Vs
coming from New York ' city. They
did not stop after the accident but
upon reading accounts in ai newspaper
came today to state the facts. - He tes
tified that it was an extremelv bad
night to drive because of the heavyf
rain and that Blumberg used, eyery
precaution.
Dr. Fred B. Buckmiller, of the
Bridarenort hosnital staff, testified that
at the time of the - accident he - had
found Anderson under theinfluence of
liquor, which the victim admitted was
hard cider he had drank at a party in
New e Haven. Blumberg was defended
by Attorneys Fallon & Greenstein of
this city.

Berlin, May 1 37 1 United
States Ambassador James W.
Gerard is convinced that peace
is in sight, according to an in
terview published in a Munich ,
newspaper today from its Ber-7
lin correspondent. Mr. Gerard
is quoted as saying:
"Nothing can shake my con
fidence that- peace is on its
Way."
The Ambassador referred to
the settlement of the differ
ences of the United States and
Germany as preparing the way
for President Wilson to take up
the question of peape.
"President Wilson, he said, "has
much weater freedom rsf wc') now
to dNl with the immense world
problem which will determine the fu- ,
ture attitude of nearly all the coun
tries of the globe. It is useless to
discuss at this moment the question
as to whether President Wilson's In
termediation is desirable or probable.
In this instance facts alone must
speak and one: of the most important
facts is that the neutrals are probably
as much interested in bringing about
an early peace as the 'belligerents.
"America urgently needs peace and
for this reason alone the American
government is under an. obligation to
its citizens to do and support every
thing that serves the cause pf peace.
A fact of chief importance is that my
government is really willing to take -action
for the promotion of peace.
'I am very optimistic regarding the
progress already made of the idea that
the war should be ended,- even among;
the belligerents. . The wise and mod
erate words of the German chancellor
regarding y Germany's readiness to
make peace had (probably their strong
est echo in America and strengthen
the impression that Germany will take
all further steps calmly and with con
fidence. 1
"When, another step will be taken,
under what shapethe further develop
ment of the peace will take is not
clear.", '.f. ... .,
. Referring to the recent crisis In Ger- .
man-American relations the ambasa
dor said; -
"I hardly know from what quarter
the present good relations between the
United States and Germany could be
disturbed. The establishment of good
relations with Germany is- one of the 1
most important factors of the diplo
matic situation wow confronting h
United States."
