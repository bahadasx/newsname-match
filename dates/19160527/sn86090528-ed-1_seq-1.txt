Graduating Exercises.
With, the auditorium crowded with
students, and friends of tho schooMn
eluding many visitors who had eoiue
from other parts of the state, with a
few also from Texas, the closing exer
cises of the most successful year la
the history of tho O. C. W. were begun
as the graduat.es entered while the
students aug the college song. : The
program proper was begun when a
chorus composed of students sang two
eongii w hich made a most pleasing impression.-
A piano duet, "Overture to
Tannhauser," bv Misses Wagoner and
Woodard, followed, and then Presi
dent Austin introduced Dr. W. W.
Pheluu, of Oklahoma university, who
delivered the address to tho claai,
Dr. Phelan chose as his subject.
"The Making of the Flag." At the
outset be said that those who work
are the makers of the flag which rep
resented' the Ideals of the people, fol
lowing w hich he dealt at some length
with the Ideals of, democracy. A large
part of the address was devoted to
, historical matters pertaining to tli
development of democratic govern
ment in America: "Democracy, in
America'" declared the speaker,
stands For ' Iibertv. fraternity and
equality. In dealing with the. latter
point, Dr. Phelan placed emphasis up
on equal "rights for women both in the
educational and the political field.
Great Adventure.
"The quest of America for liberty,
fraternity and equality is a great ad
venture. The greatest adventure for
' liberty ever made was that of the thir
teen American colonies." The sources
.of power in the American democracy,
the speaker said, were the new edu
cation, such as was being given in the
College for Women, the new efficien
cy and tho "patriotism of prepared
ness'1 as illustrated by the policies of
President Wilson, who advocated na
tional defense but not militarism. In
conclusion, after explaining the signif
icance of the colors in tho flug, declar
ing that the Stars and Stripes stood
for all the high ideals of American
democracy, the speaker said to the
graduates, "Remember, young ladies,
when you look upon that flag that the
United States is marching by."
At the conclusion of the address a
quartet composed of Misses Tuggle,
Wilson, Pearce and Frankent'ield sang
"Springtime," ( DonniXetti ). .

dent Austin and bis faculty as well as
that of the students. "The state board
of education lias never heard a single
complaint concerning this school dur
ing the past two years," said he. "I
am proud of the record that has been
made here and proud of the work of
these young ladies. In behalf of the
stute of Oklahoma I am glad indeed
to present these diplomas which have

By United Press, t"
New York, May 27. Following the
closing arguments for the defendant
and the final summing up and closing
by the prosecution, the Waite case
went to the jury at 1:23 this after
noon. Assistant District Attorney
Brothers, in his address to the jury
demanded the. death penalty, while the
attorneys for tho prisoner begged that
Waite be sent to Malteawan as a born
criminal.
Although Dr. Smith Kly Jellifp. state
alienist, declared Waite is now sane
and that he was sane at the time he
poisoned Peck, his father-iiiluw, the
nonchalant demeanor of the prisoner
during the trial has evidently impress
ed the jury with a doubt as to his
sanity. '

NECESSITY FOR SCHOOL
LEVY SHOWN BY.RAMEY
t Supt. Ramey furnishes the Express
the following statement:
The board of education of thu Chick
aslia city schools has been compelled
to call n election to vote an extra
levy of one mill iu addition to the five
mills allowed as the limit to boards of
education for the maintenance of the
schools. This comes about because
enough money to run the schools can
not be derived on the basis of a five
mills levy. This is the amount called
for and voted by a large majority one
year ago. At that time one mill was
voted and only seven-tenths of the mill
was used after the exact valuation of
the district had been determined.
Iiecause of tho fact that -the board
must make out the annual budget in
May before the valuation of tho tax
able property of the district 1ms been
estimated it becomes necessary to ask
for a safe margin ut this time. After
the valuation has been ascertained it.
may be possible to get along w'itll less
than one mill. The people of the dis
trict may rest assured that a business
like economy will be exercised by the
board. At present they can only take
the valuation of the last year. The.
election cannot be legally called later
'and it is not safe to take a chance on
an increase in valuation over hint year.
The inevitable result without the levy
would be a term of school short of
nine months.
MARCH TO

By Cnited Press.
New York, May 27. Fifteen hun
dred Roosevelt supporters marched
three miles through the deep dust this
afternoon to Sagamore Hill, the Oys
ter Bay residence of Col. Roosevelt, to
assure him of their support.
It is expected that the keynote of the
Progressives will be sounded In an ad
dress which Col. Roosevelt will deliv
er to this band of his admirers this
afternoon.
ABSTRACTS IN CRIMINAL
CASES ARE FILED TODAY.
Abstracts from justices' courts were
filed in the district court this morn
ing in two criminal cases wherein the
defendants have been held to the
higher court to answer for the offenses
with which they are charged. One
case Is that of the State vs. Shorty
Fletcher, negro, charged with assault
to kill committed upon the person of
a negro woman; the other case is that
of the State vs. "Grover" Cleveland,
charged with wholesale horse theft.
Both defendants will probably be tried
at the next regular term of district
court. ' .
ARRESTED FOR FORGERY.
Sheriff Bailey last night arrested A.
C. Boswell of Chickasha. The arrest
was made following the receipt of a
phone call from Oklahoma City offi
cers, staling that Boswell was wanted
in the city on forgery charges. The
prisoner is now In the Gradv countv
I jail awaiting the coming ot officers
jfroui Ui city.
The extra expenses for the schools
have come about by Increased popula
tion and increased number, ot children

surate increase in valuation. Tue ad

The board of education are servants
of the people, their choice and action.
The schools of the cl(y belong to all
th-i peo,,'e. Their success is a uu-.ltbr
of business maintenance and manage
ment. The schools of il:e city are uow
on a high standard.' This year will be
a transitional year in the history of
the school for -gmter improvement.
It would lie a calamity not to give this
support asked tor. The children would
sutler the loss and at the same time it
would bo a hard knock on the good
name and interest of the city.
Wo presume there will be little op
position. The danger is not in the
opposition so much as in the neglect
of those really interested In the
schools going to the polls on next
Wednesday and voting themselves
and reminding other friends of tho
cause to vote. We trust every reader
of this article will make himself a fac
tor in the campaign for our schools.
Very respectfully,
WILLIAM F. RAMEY,

2 OUT ON BONDS
FOR LOITERING
Three young men about tewn weraf
gathered into the bosom of the police
when Chief Phillips and Officer Bole
started out on a little round-up last
night. Tho chief had a hunch that
there might be something doing be
hind some closed doors in a certain;
room upstairs in a certain building on,'
Chickasha avenue near that end oC
the avenue which sprouts from tho
Rock island right of way. Quietly thai
chief and the accompanying officer
tiptoed up the iron stairway and turn
ed the door's knob preparatory to en
tering the room where it was thought;
the sleeping tiger dosed. The knob
turned but tho door responded ,nat,
hence it was that the officers wera
forced to rup long and loud with thei
butt ends of their night sticks, before,
obtaining admission.
When the admission' waa gained th
tiger, if one had been in the room, had
quietly sneaked oft and hidden himself
in his cage in some unknown seques
tered spot. Three young men. how
ever, were sitting at ease In the room.
Not being ablo to satisfactorily ex
plain what they were dolnp the chief
took them to the station whorBrt.r..
