from the entertaining feature of the

was the first warning. There was
no time in which to save anything.
Loss on the building is $1200; insur
ance $600. Loss on furniture $500;
no insurance.
The house was occupied by C. E.
Davis and family.
Thursday, )iay 18, a residence be
longing to F. W. 'Fatheree, at Tall

SILVER JUILEE
CEIEBRATED
AT ABBEY,
It seemed much to one, as though
whilst in the act of turning the pages
of a modern book, the eye should be
suddenly arrested by coming across
a leaf of old world parchment, il~fm
inated in wonderful colors of gold
and cochineal after the art of the
13th century.
This truly seemed to-illustrate the
impression made on the mind of the
layman who attended the festivity'
at St. Joseph's Abbey last Tuesday,
at Ramsay, when two very well
known fathers of the community,
Very Rev. Colunsban Wanszel, 0. S.
B., Prior, of the monastery, and Rev.
Father Gallus Anderau, O. S. B.,
Procurator, were tendered an ovation
of their confreres and friends, in
honor of their silver jubilees, result
ing from twenty-five yeats of service
in the priesthood.
The celebration began with the ar
rival of the morning train from New
Orleans, which brought out a num
ber of distinguished ecclesiastics, in
cluding Very Rev. Leo Gassier, Vicai
General; Rev. J. BB Jeanard, special
representative of Archbishop Bleak;
Fathers Nugent, -Mahoney, Vincent
and other prominent New Orleans
clergymen. In the lofty and bpu
tifully decorated chapel, at the ab
bey, a solemn high mass was cele
brated by Father Columban, assisted
by priests who formerly had been
seminary students under him. A
feature of the service was the rendi
tion of the inspiring Gregorian chant
by the seminary choir, consisting of
nearly a hundred fresh, well trained
youthful voices. To this was adder
the sermon on the occasion preached
at the close of mass by the eloquent
and venerable Father liegbert, 0.
S. 'B. -
Among members of the laity wh
were present at the tunction were
Messrs. H. J. Ostendorf, R. L. Au
bert, A. D. Schwarts,'John McMahon
W. D.. Molloy and Dr. J. P. Bouquol.
An elegant banquet was made the
means by which the good Pothers of
St. Benedict entertained their guests
in honor of the two jubilarians. Con
spicuous in the assemblage was the
presence of a sad-eyed erect looking
man, whose garb suggested high of
flee in church affairs. He seemed a
stranger in language and appear
ance. His manner .was. that of one
who took his pleasure adly, and
whose heart was sick with the
thought of exile. This happens to
be the Rt. Rev. Castelions, Cam
pecio, Mexico.
