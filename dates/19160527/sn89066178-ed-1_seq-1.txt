There was no postage stamp on

can be no Catholic Americans" we
must say that he knew whst he wsj
talking about evcu if the statement
was diKpleasing to Komish politi
cians. Of. course such as 8charf
would commend the Hoonevelt ad'
ministration fur giving public funds
to Human Catholic schools; and,
for the same rcasvn thry would
condemn the Wilson administration
for stopping surh an unconstUu
tionai and un-American practice.
It hays that President Wilson
sent secret agent to Mexico to
"plan, and wheme, and couxpirc
with a lot of cutthroats." The
preaident is t harged with "colossal
blunders" while the administrations
of Rooeevelt and Taft are praised
because "liooserrll had tuo Cafc
olics in his cabinet" and actuafly
"srn Taft Jo the Holy Father" to
sdjust Philippine matters to papal
fall.-fart ion.
Then follow" an urgent plea for
the support of Senator Dick as
candidate for the Ohio senat.rship.
Among the nimnmon. hit ions of
fered in behalf of that gentleman
is the reminder of his psrt in pay
ing Rome million of dollar for
so-called, friars' lands in those is
lands lands which never belonged
to either the friars or the papal
system. Mr. Scharf and his asso
ciates would like to have a senate
of Dicks ready to perform a similar
servu-e for the pope in the possible
reconstruction of Mexico.
Senator Dirk has evidently been
Rome's devoted friend, if Scharf
can be believed; and, for that rea
son, the election is supported and
urged by this papal meddler in Ohio
politics. Here is the opportunity
ior Rome to reinstate one of its
tried and trusted friends in the
senate of the United States: and
tle opportunity is improved in a
way most remarkable.
The claim that Dick is a Luther
an should not confuse the honest
voters of Ohio. lie may be a con
sistent Lutheran communicant for
all we know; and, if he is. it is

vate life.
tucks the Public Schools
It is evident, from the content
of this document, that Mr. Dick
and his friends-are depending upon
the Roman Catholic vote, won by
pro-papal favors, for his election.
The proper thing for patriot to do,
therefore, is to let the papist fleet
Mr. Dkk if they can. But why
should any non-papist help in the
consummation of surh a scheme?
Ohio surely has better senatorial
material, and candidates more ac
ceptable to the honest citizen of
that great state.
The content of the Catholic
Xetrt Bulletins, al enclosed nr the
package illegally sent out postage
free, are a papist ically partisan,
and even more bitter in their n-
trmpcrate attacks upon the presi
dent and upon everything else that
honest citizens respect. From a
first-page article describing its
editor's first, and later, trip to the
American Middle West, we repro
duce the following:
"On my first vinit tbe number of
churches (Romaa Catholic) was still
linute.l, aut the scattered, panx-hia
schools BprDid to b tottering on the
brink of dettrurtioa. Tha Catholic body
was still impregnated with tbe virus of
fanaticism that poianned the minda of
the faithful and kd them to aecept the

lief ha been aoriousW shaken. This was
socompliahed in part by th building up
of a parochial achool system of areater

Inefficient unit. But the chief factor in
deatroytnjr the faith of Catholics in the
public schools was their own gradual de
terioration. Tbe pnblic school ttill has

School and Scholars Vilified
IIow the loyal friends of the pub
lic schools must relish the free use
of the mails to disseminate such
sentiment as the foregoing quota
tion contains! Has Tun Menace
overstated the fact when it charged
political RomnniMn ith a deliber
ate and studied conspirtu y to dis
rupt and destroy our splendid sys
tem of public etlucatumt Remem
ber that thi attack upon our schools
is not a matter of ancient history,
but is printed on the first page of
the Catholic Sewi Bulletin for the
month of April, 1916, arrogantly
published in the shadow of the na
tional Capitol, and distributed
postage free under the frank of an
Alabama congressman. Idn't it
about time for the American people
to wake up and realize what is go
ing on? One more parsgraph from
the same article on the same first
page:
"The teachings of the. church (Roman
Catholic) as re pert otedienc to the
law, respect of authority, maintenance of
property rights and a dutiful obaerTanre
of her own teachings and regulations has
innuiea in tne Catholic people of our be
loved country an unconscious discipline,
which is th stronger for not being recog.
ntied, nor evnn suspected. This admirable
discipline is the product of the parochial
school and of the higher institutions of
learning of the Catholic church. AND IS
ALMOST TOTALLY LACK IN O IN

This quoted paragraph" implies
mat ine millions ol men and
women, tried and true, who have
received their training in the pub
lic schools, are almost totally lack
ing in obedience to lav, respect for
authority, regard for property

On th second page of this April
Bulletin is an article eudoraing
Theodore Roosevelt for the presi
dency. On thia subject and front
thi article we quote briefly aa fol
low: for Eoosevelt, Against Wilson

Following the Roosevelt article is
one entitled, "The American Auto

upon the president, calculated to
embarrass the present administra
tion in this hour when it is con
fronted by graxe problems of ei
traordmary import to the nation.
Here it ia in all it treasonable bit
terness and gross extravagance:
"In Kiisnia they say, Stand by the

Tub Mga( r. is not the chumpion
of any candidate or party. When
occasion arises we criticize Mb Wil
son's policies iu freely as we would
those of any other public ollicial;
but we must say that this personal
attack upon him contaiu more that
is unfair, more that is misleading.
and more that ia absolutely false
than can usually be crowded into
the space it occupies. It merely
expresses the hatred of Rome for
the president it ha been unable to
use for it owji criminal purposes
in Mexico. Consider also the fol
lowing gem from thi propaganda
sheet of popery:
' What is the as of aa American aa-
basaador t Mexico when a Preabrterian
preacher aa personal representative of

"Comptroller Downey tniht ties the

CaUahan, Qallivan and Co.
We might appropriately inquire,
hy this solicitude in regard to
postage stamps on the part of a
papist publisher who mail his pa
per without paying postage of any
kind, bditors of hi kind have
been grieving over what it cost the
government to carry the large edi
tions of The Menace, notwith
standing the fact that we pay the
regular rate for its transmission.
Row consistent is this petty quibble
over postage which he should buy
the same as others, but manages in
Rome's mvsteriou way to avoid.
In conclusion, this number of the
Bulletin pay its respect to Col
onel Callahan and hi K. C. tar-
Dish committee aa follow:

It is very "practical" for the papal

Congress I Learning
It seems that member of con
gress re taking note of such pro
cedure, for Congressman Barnhartg
of Indiana, has recently called np a
house bill intended to correct such
evil a we have described. Presa
dispatches in reference to the bill
carefully refrain from mentioning
its connection with papistic prac
tices, but refer to it ia general
term which the informed will un
derstand and know how to apply
One new article reads, in part, at
follows:
The bill, Barnhart exptained, aimed to)
curtail tbe privilege of outside internet
getting a member of eongreaa to further
nie serial propaganda on the floor and
then provide the money for printing the
speeches with the undcrataading that the
speech ahall be carried ia envelopes fur
nished free by the vovernment and under
th congreaaional frank of the member
ho delivered it. Ta his own knowle.li-,
he stated, one member one delivered a
peecb aad bad t million copies printed.

some fortv women and need government
envelopes aad the government mail eorv
ice free of charge to spread that speech

asked for the name. 4 'if we were to atari
ia and give the name of members who
have indulged in questionable practice
of that kiad,'' Barnhart warned. "II
would be surprising to thi House." But
he told of another instane- of a member,
now deceased, who ordered two kiads of
envelopes, franked, oaa foe aradVne; oat
