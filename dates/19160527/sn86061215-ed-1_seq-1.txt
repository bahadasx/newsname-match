American Engineers Drive
His Men to Hills After
'm Surprise Attack
ENGAGEMENT IS
HOT FOR FULL HOUR
U. S. Infantry Appears on

Immediately Flee
N**!e!d
Headquarters, near Nanriquipa,
Mexico, May 25.—By radio to Colum
bus, N. M., May 26.—Candelarce Cer
vantes, the Villista bandit leader, was
killed by American troops south of
Cruces today. Gen. Pershing consid
ers Cervantes second in importance
only to Villa.
Cervantes' end came after he had
made a surprise attack south of Crnces
on a detachment of engineers. He was
beaten back and pursued into the hills
by the engineers, reinforced by a de
tachment of the seventeenth infantry-
One other Mexican, Jose Bencorne,
and one of the Americans were killed.
Two Americans were wounded.
When the engagement began, the
bandits outnumbered the Americana
two to one, there being twenty of
them. The engagement lasted almost
an hour, with a hot interchange of bul
lets. Then reinforcements .from the
seventeenth came in sight and the
Villistas fled to the hills.
Private George O. Hulitt was the
hero of the fight. Bullets from his
rifle laid- low. both of the bandits
killed.
The identification of Cervantes was
at first uncertain. Later, however,
Mexicans who examined the body de
clared ,it was* that, of Cervantes. It
was' photographed for further identi
fication.. ,•
Cervantes' home is- in Namiquipa.
He has been a thorn in the side of the
army In northern Cbibuahua ever since
the expedition began. He had suc
ceeded hitherto in avoiding persistent
cavalry searches. His death probably
means the breaking up of the Villistas
in this section.
Gen. Pershing is much gratified over
the latest fight, saying that there re
main only a few scattered bands of
marauders to. be hunted down. The
American loss was Corpal Davis
Marksbury, killed, and Privates Geo.
F. Nicholson and George Hulett
wounded. Georges Bencorn was an
other Mexican killed. The remainder
of the band was pursued and dis
persed.
ANIM08ITY SHOWN.
Columbus, N. M., May 26.—American
truckmen recently have encountered a
spirit of animosity on the part of sol
diers of some of the Carranza com
mands along the American line of com
munication in Mexico, according to
stories brought here today. Near
Nuevo Casee Grandes, 120 miles south
of the border, barbed wire, barriers
have been thrown across the road sev
eral times and Wednesday a train com
manded by Capt. R. B. Harper was
halted by a crowd in which there were
a number of Carranza soldiers. The
mob jeered at the Americans and
threw stones at them but no shots
were fired. Although several stones
struck members of the truck crew,
orders were given to proceed without
retaliation.
TROUBLES ARE FEARED.
El Paso, Tex., May 26.—Residents of
Dona Ana county, New Mexico, along
the border, are taking extra precau
tions tod&y against trouble following
the shooting last night of a Mexican
by C. D. Cassad, a rancher.
According to a deputy sheriff, nine
Mexicans approached the Cassad place
last night and were ordered away by
the proprietor.
Antonio Bermudez disregarded the
order and was shot by Cassad, who
then surrendered to the sheriff at Las
Crudes.
MANY SOLDIERS FAINT.
v"
San Antonio, Tex., May 26. —Mem
bers of the Texas national guard, who
have been impatient at the delay in be
ing ordered to posts along the border,
fainted in large numbers yesterday
while waiting in line to be inoculated
with antityphus virus.
"Psychological phenomenon," lacon
ically remarked the army surgeons.
Further than that, no one knows ac
curately why militiamen and regulars
as well who often later distinguish
themselves in' action Bhould be over
come at the prospect of undergoing a
treatment characterized by no pain
and no ugly spilling of blood.
'Everyone knows that typhoid fever
Is dangerous, often causing death,"
aid one surgeon. "Perhaps it is that
Perhaps it is the waiting. The thoughts
*V act on the emotions, but more we do
not know. You never can tell which
..man will faint and which won't."
The inoculation proceeded industri
^Susly despite the psychological cas

CHARGE 18 OPENLY MADE THAT
AMERICANS ARE 8EEKING TO
DOMINATE COUNTRY.
Mexico City, May 26.—The govern
ment newspapers in their editorials tft
day make savage attacks on the policy
of the United States In Latin-America,
which they denounce as imperialistic
and hypocritical. Col. Roosevelt is
charged with attempting to foment
war and the papers assert thst Presi
dent Wilson is unable to cope, with
this "campaign of the republican par
ty." One of the principal administra
tion organs says:
"The Mexican nation can not permit
itself to be made the,tool of Yankee
felony or submit to the corruption of
American gold. The American conspir
ators are aided by the machinations of
Mexicans who desire to see Gen. Scott
in the national palace, tutor of a gov
ernment presided over by Calero, An
geles, Gam boa and De La Garaa."

Athene Reports That Some Movement
of Moment Is Brewing Along War
Front In Serbia.
Athens, May 26.—Exceptional mili
tary activity at Saloniki is believed
here to portend developments of great
importance. Gen. Howell, chief of
the British staff, and other officers of
the allies who have been on leave in
Athens, have been recalled.
On May 13 Bulgaria was reported to
be sending heavy reinforcements to
the Saloniki front in anticipation of
a general offensive by the allies.
Since that time dispatches have re
ported activity on the part of the
French and British forces, the most
notable being the occupation of Fior
ina, eighteen miles south of Monas
tir, by allied troops May 23. Signi
ficance was also attached to efforts
of the entente to obtain the use of
the Greek railroad for the transporta
tion of the reorganized Serbian army
to the Saloniki front. Paris and Lon
don have been persistently silent as to
any developments in the Balkans.

PLEAOFLEAGUE
American Organization Has
Plan to Assure Peace
of Entire World
UNION OF NATIONS
TO PROVIDE FORCE
Wars to Be Waged Only if
Laws of International
Court Are Violated
Washington, D. C., May 26.—Ameri
can advocates of an International fed
eration to curtail war met here today
for the first assembly of the new lea
gue to enforce peace. William How
ard Taft, president of the league, and
Newton D. Baker, secretary of war,
were on today's program, and Presi
dent Wilson's address at the closing
session tomorrow night will be a sig
nificant utterance, it is thought. About
2,000 persons attended the meeting.
Former President Taft'B subject was
an explanation of why the constitution
al authority of the president and con
gress to declare war would not be
violated by the league's plan for a fed
eration of nations.
Speakers pointed out that war might
npt be abolished but it would be cur
tailed, for the international league
would allow combat only if the court's
decree were not accepted by any na
tion.
Thomas Raeburn White, Philadel
phia lawyer, in his address sought to
answer arguments advanced against
the league's plan.
Edward A. Filene, Boston merchant,
declared European nations at the end
of the present war would be favorable
to the league to enforce peace.
Other speakers on today's program
were Oscar S. Straus, of New York,
member of The Hague court Hamil
ton Holt of New York, editor of the
Independent .. Prof. George Crafton
Wilson, of ftafvard university Talcott
Williams, director of (Columbia uni
versity School of journalism John
Bates Clark of New York, director of a
department in the Carnegie endow
ment for international peace R. G.
Rhett of Charleston, S. C., president of
the chamber of commerce of the Uni
ted States Samuel Gompers, presi
dent of the American Federation of
Labor, and Oliver Wilson of Peoria,
111., president of the national grange.
Taft Explains Plan.
Mr. Taft explained that the league's
platform proposes compulsory sub
mission to the world court of an inter
national dispute not settled by diplo
matic negotiation and which are
"jusficiable questions."
Turning to the question of the ^uty
of a nation belonging to thd proposed
world court to use its army and navy
in enforcing its decrees upon other
members that should go to war in de
fiance of the court's decrees, Mr. Taft
took issue with former Secretary of
State Bryan regarding.Mr. Bryan's
contention that constitutional amend
ment would be necessary before the
United States could so obligate Itself.
"I venture to think that this view
is wholly without foundation," said
Mr. Taft. "If the war is a foreign war
it could not be begun under the con
stitution until congress had declared
war."
Referring to this nation's treaty
with Panama, guaranteeing Panama's
independence, Mr. Taft stated it meant
the United States is under obligation
to make war to defend Panama.
"This duty can only be discharged
through the action of congress in de
claring war," he asserted. "Does that
deprive congress of its power to de
clare war? It seems to me the ques
tion answers itself."
With Cuba a similar situation is pre
sented, said the former president.
WILSON HA8 OLIVE BRANCH.
Washington, D. C., May 26.—From
an authoritative source it was learned
today that the president is preparing
to do everything possible in an inform
al way to bring about the discussion
of peace between belligerent nations.
The president is convinced the war
is deadlocked and that a continuance
merely means the killing of more peo
ple and the further impoverishment of
European nations, both belligerent and
neutral.
Mr. Wilson is understood to agree
with a suggestion that a peace follow
ing a decisive defeat of one nation or
group would create only lasting hatred
and sow seeds of future conflicts.
The president takes the position that
the neutrals of the world as much as
belligerents have a right to participate
in and initiate peace negotiations be
cause of the economic results already
developed and those which will follow
the conflict.
The president has been deeply inter
ested in the growth of peace talk
among responsible officials in several
of the belligerent nations during the
last three weeks. He has read and
filed away recent speeches by Presi
dent Poincare of France, Sir Edward
Grey, foreign minister of Great Brit
ain, and Chancellor von Bethmann
Hollweg of Germany.

PARI8 REPORTS NO CHANGE8
BUT BERLIN TELLS OF VARI
OUS GAIN8.
Paris, May 26.—There has been
little change in the situation on the
Verdun front, says the official an
nouncement issued by the war office
this afternoon.
The artillery bombardment was vio
lent about Avocourt wood and Le
Mort Homme. At the latter place a
German attack was stopped by the
French curtain of fire at its inception.
On the right bank of the Meuse the
French succeeded in recovering part
of the trenches occupied yesterday by
the Germans between Haudremont
wood and Thiamont farm. Otherwise
the battle front was calm.
ITALY NOT ALARMED.
Rome, May 26. —The retreat of the
Italians on a portion of the Trenttno
front has not caused any pessimism in
official circles here. It is pointed out
that tbe entire line of battle is four
hundred miles long and that there
need be no surprise that there should
be withdrawals at some points under
overwhelming pressure.
The fact that the Austrian^ now hold
a small mountainous section of Italian
territory is considered of small impor
tance when compared with the fifteen
miles greater territory now occupied
by the Italians in Austria. It is also
contended that if the enemy continues
to advance the conditions which have
favored him hitherto will be reversed
as the farther he gets from his base of
operations the more difficult It will be
to supply ammunition for his heavy
guns.
These considerations are indepen
dent of the natural obstacles which
make the Austro-Italian front so dif
ferent from that at Verdun. An official
statement has been issued explaining
it is impossible to limit the war to
trench fighting in a region like the
Trentino where large masses of troops
can be easily transferred from one
point to another without weakening
any section of the front.
A large number of refugees from. p^r^ RpnrPtnrv
Arsiero, Aslago and neighboring vil-V °°I- .Secretary
lages have arrived at Milan. The
evacuation of their home towns was or
dered by the Italian military authori
ties when the great Austrian offensive
started.
GERMAN REPORT.
Berlin, May 26—German troops have
continued successfully their attacks on
the east bank of the Meuse, extending
their positions to the west of Haudre
mont quarry and crossing the Douau
mont ravine, the war office announced
today. South of Ft. Douaumont the
French were driven further. The Ger
mans captured an additional 600 pris
oners and twelve machine guns.
WANT U. 8. CRITICISED.
Berlin, May 26. —The United States
played a large role in the censo^phip
debate in the reichstag today. Two of
the principal speakers, Deputy Oertel
conservative and Deputy Hirsch, na
tional liberal, severely crltised the
government for measures which they
allege were adopted to suppress criti
cism of the United States In the news
papers and to put brakes on the agita
tion for a more vigorous campaign.
WAR SUMMARY.
There is no abatement in the fight
ing around Verdun, the Germans keep
ing up their bombardment while the
French are replying virtually shot for
shot and under the withering fire
holding the Germans at nearly every
point. The Germans, however, have
occupied a section of French trenches
after a series of attacks in which
they suffered tremendous losses.
The Germans have started a bom
bardment of hill 304 on a scale not
before attempted, probably prepara
tory to another Infantry attack for
possession of this point of vantage
which has been the scene of terrible
slsu^htGrt
Rome reports that the Italians have
forced back in disorder the Austrians
who have been on the offensive in the
region southeast of Trent for some
time.
On the Russian front the fighting is
proceeding at various points, though
no decisive engagements have been
reported.
Heavy bombardments and infantry
actions are reported on the Macedon
ian front.

WOMEN1 RIOT WHEN
DENIED MEAT SUPPLY
London, May 26.—An Amsterdam
dispatch to the Exchange Telegraph
Co. says that eighteen women were
wounded in a fight between police and
food rioters at Frankfort-on-the-Main
Wednesday night,\according to a dis
patch received at The Ha^ue.
The riot is said to have been started
owing to a shortage of meat in the
local butcher shops. Three hundred
and fifty women, who had been told
there was no meat for them, marched
through the streets carrying black
famine flags and singing socialistic
songs.
The women forced their way into
one butcher BhOp. After a search
they found some meat which they cut
up and continued their march holding
the pieces above their heads.
Police atempted to take the meat
from the women and a general riot
following in which the officers used
their swords. One woman was arrest
ed for shouting "Down with the em
peror." A local paper which referred
to the affair was ordered suspended
for two months.

WAITE'S LAWYER
cv f-\A^
FOR INSANITY PLEA
EFFORT BE IMG MADE TO SHOW
THE JURY THAT MURDERER
IS UNBALANCED.
New York, May 28. —Dr. Arthur W.
Waite told an alienist engaged for his
defense in his trial for the murder of
John E. Peck, the Grand Rapids, Mich,
millionaire that he had Intended to
kill his wife, Clara Peck Waite, and
that hd* married her only for her
money, according to testimony given
by the alienist, Dr. Morris J. Karpas,
today. Dr. Karpas added that Waite
said he did not intend to stop at any
thing to gain his ends.
Accused of planning to leave the
country with Mrs. Margaret Horton, he
did not deny it but said she "did not
know that" they were going away. Dr.
Waite declined to admit that he had
made himself appear worse than he
was in order to convince the jury that
he was insane.
The alienists for Waite testified that
he did not appear"to be mentally well
and that he was abnormal in that all
his interests were centered in himself.
WOMEN EXCLUDED.
Women were excluded from the
court room when Dr. Arthur W. Waite
resumed his testimony In defense of
himself against a charge of having
murdered his wealthy father-in-law,
John E. Peck of Grand Rapids, Mich.
Hundreds of persons in the corridors
vainly tried to gain admission to the
court room. Waite appeared pale but
seemed to have braced himself to face
the ordeal.
His counsel, Walter R. Deuel, told
Justice Shearn that he had only a few
more questions to ask the dentist be
fore the cross examination would be
gin:
"Did you ever try to kill your wife?"
asked Mr. Deuel.
"No," replied Dr. Waite.
"Did you ever plan to kill her?"
"No, never."!
"You never thought you might kill
her?"
I am not sure that. I would not
ve killed her," said Waite.
Assistant District Attorney Brothers
then began the cross examination.
"Do you recall telling me that you
did not want your wife to learn of
your relations with Mrs. Horton?"
"No," replied Waite.

6RAN0E0 FALSE
Washington, D. C., May 26. —The
state department made this statement
regarding published reports that Sec
retary Lansing was contemplating re
signing from the cabinet because of
differences with President Wilson:
"This story is a part of a propa
ganda, the deliberate purpose of which
is to create an appearance of dissen
sion in the government which does not
exist. The story was born last Febru
ary or March when the relations be
tween the United States and Germany
were somewhat strained. It was sent
to Berlin by wireless in press dis
patches. It was picked up in transit
in an allied country and subsequently
published there. In that way the state
department became cognizant of the
story and instructions were sent to
Berlin to watch out for it. Apparently
the persons responsible found out we
were prepared for the story, because it
never was published in Germany. The
directors of this propaganda have now
taken advantage of Secretary Lan
sing's illness to put the story out
Mr. Lansing personally denied that
he was considering resigning.
