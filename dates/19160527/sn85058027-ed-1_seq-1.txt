H s
The mining world of Utah was startled Thursday by the
announcement that Peter Miller, the chief owner of the Fissures
Leasing Co., who had a ten year lease on the big Pacific mine
I lind sold his interest in tho lease to Charles A. Gillette and
Tronic J. Gustin, prominent Salt Lake attorneys. The price
I paid 1ms not been given out bnt $25,000 mentioned in a Shit
Lake article is considered ridiculous, and one official in (he
H Pacific Company saidthat it was more likely to be $100,000,
H as according to Mr. Miller's statement he owned three fourths
H of the leasing company's stock and it is well known that tin;
leasers have already spent over $25,000 in opening up the mine!
H From another source it is re
H ported that Mr. Dilloway and
H associates of Boston, chief
H -owners in tho Utah Metal and
H Tunnel Co. of Bingham are tho
H real purchasers of the Miller
H interest. It is learned that Mr.
H Dilloway has recently paid two
H visits to the mine, that Messrs.
H Gilleltl' and Gustin were also
H up there two or three times the
H past ten days. They also had
1 mi engineer make a thorough
H survey, examination and snm
H pling. An effort was made to
1 get Mr. Dilloway on the phone
H but lie had just left for Bos
H ton.
H Just before going to j)ress
Mr. Doolittle was reached ov-
H cr the phone at Bingham, and
IM he stntod that he is the pur-
chaser of tho Miller interest,
THhut that officials of the Utah
JRtats una Tinmurcorunnra
d V Bocinted with him in the deal.
" He also stated that he had
B some big news that would not
jM be ready for the public for two
J weeks, but that it would in-
EtH elude a big mill to be built

The new owners will push the
development work from now
on with more vigor and will
continue to ship the high
grade as it is encountered. Mr.
Doolittle is the manager of the
Utah Metal and Tunnel Co. at
Bingham and was the chief
owner with Mr. Miller in the
Pacific lease, lie slated that
he was not at liberty now to
state the price paid for the
lease.
Mr. Miller gives as his reas
on for selling that his health
is not good in the canyon and
tho price offered looked good
so he took it. Mr. Miller said
recently that when the fissure
was cut it was running about
20 degrees ,casl of north, but
that its direction now is 15 de
grees west of north.

cated a group of six claims
immediately adjoining the Pa

of the vein. This valuable prop
erty has been open to location
for years.
It will all bo hero by tho middle of tho
month, when ho expects to trcbblo tho
amount of rook now being broken.
Tho Kail-Kaglo management expects
to cut tho Wyoming fissure In nbout
200 more feet, though tho Inci easing

would lndlcato that another fissure
might bo cut beforo this.
Tho Karl-Knglo Is building a new

Mnnngor Clmiles Tyng of tho Whirl

Interview this week, stated that work
would commence nt onco on pushing
tho 3,000 foot tunnel to bo run on this
promising property. A force of men
hnvo been nt work during tho past
ten dnys grading out for tho miner's
hoarding and bunk house, ns well ns
for tho blacksmith nnd machine shop.
"Whl'o this work has been pro
gressing," said Mr. Tyng, "I havo had
all ot the lumber nnd other materials
for tho buildings cut nnd framed .In
tho lumber yards and will begin haul
ing It up the canyon today or tomor
row. This will farlllato tho construc
tion of tho buildings nnd save freight
on tho surplus mntorlal, which
amounts to something right now,
when wo have to pay so mueh n hun
dred pounds, even on common lumber.
Tho poitnl of tho tunnol will bo

tho dividing lino, nnd about 225 feet
south of tho old Dutchman workings.
The courso of tho tunnel will bo prac
tically northwest, at right angles with
tho general stilkc of tho flssurlng In
thnt locality.
Ned Wild, ono of tho most exper
ienced miners In tho canyon Is sup
erintendent of tho property and will
push tho tunnel with thrco shifts. A
Compressor nnd mnchlno drills will ho

transmission line Is um Into tho dis

T Dutchman Mine
WILL PUT BIG FORCE OF MINERS AT WORK MEANS
MUCH TO CANYON.
Charley Doolittlu in an inlerviow with this paper yester
day stated that himself and associates had taken a lease on the
Dutchman mine and would open it up on an extensive sea e.
They already have several men at work and will increase the
force fast as arrangement can bo made for them to work advan
tageously in the property. The Dutchman is one o the famous
old mines of the district, hut the many thousands of dollars
taken out in the 70's was practically all from the surlaee.
The new owners will develop tho property on a big scale.
Thov havo made tho Utah Metal and Tunnel Co., one of the bis
mines of tho state and American Fork Canyon is to be consid
ered most fortunate in having them develop this promising
property.

At n Commercial Club luncheon
Clifford Young, chairman of tho club

S. I,. Chlpmnn, proaldont of the club,
also referred to tho snmo thing. Citi

Mayor Huntor when Intel viewed
-stated that the city only agreed to

up from tho streets, that tho people
aro expected to clean up their own
