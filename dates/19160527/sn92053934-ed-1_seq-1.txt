Speech to League Dele

GERMANY IN TURMOIL
Munich Paper Prints Inter
view "With Ambassador
Gerard on Subject.
Washington, May 27. President
Wilson today finished the carefully
prepared speech he is to deliver to
niL'hl before the Leacue to Knforce
Peace. 1 lie speech is expected to
reiea! for the first time the presi
dent's interprets ion of the trend
of world opinions on the question
of peare.
A ieasrue of nations, backed by an in
ternational police force is looked upon
by the president as a possible means
of minimizing the danger of war. It is
understood that tonight he -will care
fully set forth his views on the ques
tion. There were renewed evidences to
day that the president is deeply inter
ested in the continued public discus
sions of peace, although there were no
indications that he was yet ready to
renew formal efforts to end the war.
Pence Talk Gaining.
Berlin. May 2fi, (via London, May 27,
7:4S a. m. ) t'nited States Ambassador
James Gerard is convinced that peace
is in sight, according to an interview
published in a Munich paper from its
Berlin corn-? pondent Mr. Gerard is
quoted as saying:
"Nothing tau shake my confidence
that peace is on its way."
The ambassador referred to the set
tlement of the differences of the I'nitc-d
States and Germany as preparing the
way for President Wilson to take up
the question of peace. "President Wil
son," he said, "has much greater free
dom of action now to deal with the
immense world problem which will de
termine the future attitude of nearly
all the countries of the globe.
"It is useless to discuss at this mo
ment the question as to whether Presi
dent Wilson's Intermediation is deir
able or probable. In this instance facts
alone must speak and one of the most
important facts is that the neutrals
are probably as much interested in
bringing about an early peace as the
belligerent;. America urgently needs
peace and the American government is
under obligation to its citizens to do
everything that serves the cause of
peace. My government is really will
ing to take action of the promotion of
peace.
Gerard Optimistic
"I am very optimistic regarding the
progress already made of the idea that
the war should be ended, even among
belligerent nations. The wise and
moderate words of the German chan
cellor regarding Germany's readiness
to make peace had probably their
strongest echo in America and
strengthen the impression that Ger
many will take all further steps calm
ly and with confidence.
"When another step will be taken
and what shape the further develop
ment of the peace idea will take is not
clear. At any rate I am convinced that
my government will leave nothing un
done to support with all its power
peace movements from whatever side
they wme."
Austria Still Wants Pu'venire.
Ilome. May '. (1:25 p. m. I "Peace
cannot be concluded without first giv
ing a deserved lesson to the Italian
traitors," id the prevailing opinion in
Austria, says the Giornale D'lt&lia.
The offensive in great force against
the Italian front, the newspaper adds,
is due to the Austrian military party,
supported by conservatives and cleri
cals, who are convinced that they will
obtain a complete victory'-
WHEREIN POLLY IS
DEPOSED BY SUFFS
v
Chicago, May 27. There will be no
ret n arid yellow parrot in the suf
frage parade held here on June 7.
Polly did not behave and he is back
in the bird More from which he came.
But he created a stir before being de
throned from the position of "olficial
barker" for the suffragists.
I'arade headquarters were opened
yesterday and the parrot, which had
been named "Polly -Votes," was there.
It had been announced that the parrot
was to be taught to talk for votes and
that ho was to be carried in the parade
to make known his desire for suf
frape for women. The bird store man
assured the committee tiiat the par
rot did not swear but the day was
opened by a recital of all the swear
words polly knew. The bird refused
to learn the official slogan as he was
told, which was to be "Polly Votes"
and would say but one word "Votes"
and would follow it with derisive
laughter, lie stole the beauty patch
off one sufragist's cheek, bit and
scratched and behaved so undignih'edly
that he was soon on the way back to
b-u owner.
Gen. Gallieni
ofParisDies;
Hero of Poor
Paris, May 27. ( S : 25 a. m.) General
Joseph S. Gallieni. former minister of
war, died at Versailles today.
The death of General Gallieni creat
ed a profound impression, as he was
idolized by the French people, par
ticularly the poor, who regarded him
as the saviour of Paris during the crit
ical days of August, 1914. His fun
eral will be the occasion of a notable
military and civil demonstration.
After the notable part taken by
General Gallieni in the battle of
Marne, when he rushed $0,000 troops
of the Paris garrison to the battle line
in taxicabs at the crisis of the struggle
and thereby turned the tide of victory
in favor of the French, he was ap
pointed minister of war in the recon
structed cabinet.
As war minister. General Gallieni
devoted himself with remarkable ener
gy to the elimination of red tape in
the administration of the army. He
also dealt with a heavy hand with
officers who had secured posts through
favoritism or political influence. His
first act was to forbid civilians to
write to the generals in the field in
regard to military matters and his
next was to send to the front a num
ber of able bodied soldiers who occu
pied billets in the rear. He was re
lentless in forcing the retirement of
old officers whose activities or abil
ities were not equal to demands of
war. By revision of the exempt lists
he added S0.000 men to the army.
In February of this year, General
Gallieni took over the direction of the
department of aviation but shortly af
terwards he was taken ill with kidney
trouble and was compelled to resign
on March 6. Since then he has been i
fighting a losing battle with death.

STERN NOTE SENT
ON MAIL SEIZURE
Washington, May 27. The United
States, denouncing interference with
neutral mails, has notified Great
Britain and France that it can no
longer tolerate the wrongs which
American citizens have suffered and
continue to suffer through the "law
less practice" those governments have
indulged in, and that only a radical
change in policy, restoring the T'nited
States to its full rights as a neutral
power, will be satisfactory.
This notification is given in the lat
est American communication to the
two governments, the text of which
was made public by the state depart
ment last night. The time in which
the change must be affected is not
specified, but the United States expects
prompt action.
"Onerous and vexatious" abuses
which have been -perpetrated by the
British and French governments in
seizing and censoring neutral mails
are rec iting in the communication, and
answers are made to the legal argu
ments contained in the reply of the
entente governments to the first Amer
ican note on the subject.
It is vigorously set for that not only
have American commercial interests
been injured but that the rights of
property have been violated and the
rules of international law and custom
palpably disregarded. Notice is serv
ed that the t'nited States soon will
press claims against the British and
French governments for the losses
which already have been sustained.
SENATE BODY
LOBofpS
Charge of Surrender Made
by Official SrPbstal De---partment
Refuted.
Washington, May 27. Fourth As
sistant Postmaster General Blaksleo
told the senate postoftice committee
to its face today he considered its
amendments to the postal bill a sur
render to the railroads and although
he drew the wrath of senators at the
hearing upon him he defended his ac
tion in organizing a campaign against
the amendments.
The committee met to investigate
charges that Blakslee organized a lob
by. The amendments to which Blakslej
referred, concern railway mail pay
and rural delivery. He told the sen
ators they had by their amendments
given the railroads what they wanted
and would disorganize S00 rural de
livery routes and inconvenience 300,
000 citizens.
Mr. Blakslee took full responsibil
ity for actions and said that, based on
his own experience with postal affairs
of three years and the advice of ex
perts in the department he had reach
ed the conclusion that the amendments
were bad.
Senator Marline asked on what he
based that assertion.
"On the bill itself," replied Mr.
Blakslee.
"The railroads did not want pay
based on space. They wanted annual
weighing. They got it. There was a
provision in the house bill penalizing
railroads $5,000 for not carrying the
mails. The railroads did not want it.
It was stricken out of the bill."
"But your use of the word 'surren
der' implies an absolute subserviency
on the part of this committee to the
railroads and as one I must say, your
action was most unlit and very un
warranted," protested Senator Mar
tine. "That is your opinion," responded
Mr. Blakslee".
"Do you think you had the right to
organize a lobby of postmasters to
fight a proposal that hail been adopted
bv unanimous vote of our sub-com
mittee the unanimous vote of sen
ators of both parties?" demanded Sen
ator Hardwick.
"I beg your pardon, sir," responded
Mr. Blakslee. "I organized no lobby.
1 had a right to exert my influence as
a citizen and as an official to prevent
injury to the postal service that
would take years to correct"
"Do you think you are big enough
to set your judgment up against the
unanimous judgment of this commit
tee." "I set up my honest judgment xm
the right side of the question."

Co11ege;Two
Dead, 2 Hurt
Oskaloosa, la., May 27. Two men
were killed, two probably fatally in
jured and property damage, estimated
at between eighty and one hundred
thousand dollars, wrought by the fire
which at 4 a. m. today broke out in .the,
main building of I'enn college here.
Robert H. Williams, business manager
of the college and state secretary of
the prohibition party, and Harry Oak
ley, a freshman, were killed. George
Minear and Howard Kelley, students,
are in the hospital and may die.
The lire broke out in the biological
laboratory on the second floor of the
building. It was discovered by stu
dents who had rooms on the third
floor. Efforts were made to check the
spread of the flames, but they reached
a 40-gallon tank of alcohol which ex
ploded, scattering liquid fire in all di
rections. Efforts of the fire department to ex
tinguish the flames proved unavailing,
due to insufficient water pressure.
Williams and Oakley were killed
while attempting to save the college
records. Most of the records had been
carried out when the fire reached the
cupola and the four-ton college bell
crashed down through the building,
wrecking the front wall and burying
the victims under tons of debris.
Minear and Kelley, the injured, are
cut and bruised and are believed to
have suffered internal injuries. They
were hurt while rescuing the S. H. M.
Byers art collection, which was hung
in the chapel hall. The collection,
made up of copies of famous paintings,
is said to be worth $50,000.
Loss to the building, which was
three stories high and of brick con
struction, will be about $50,000. Lab
oratory apparatus, records, books from
the college library, etc., will bring the
loss up $30,000 to $50,000 more. The
property was only partially insured.
Defective electric wiring is believed
to have started the fire.
Adopt Measnre to Check Food Kiofs.
London, May 27, (9:53 a. m.) The

FACES ELECTRIC CHAIR
Must Pay Death Penalty for
Killing His Millionaire
Father-in-Law.
Tfew Tort, May 27. Dr. Arthur '
Warren Wait was today found
puilty of the- murder of his father-in-law,
John Peck, the Grand
Itapids millionaire.
"Guilty of murder in the first
decree" was the verdict the jury
returned after 1 hour and 25 min
utes' deliberation.
Waite was remanded to the
Tomhs to await imposition of sen
tence on June 1.
"While the jury was deciding his
fate Waite was eating a hearty din
ner. Mrs. Clara Peck Waite, with her
friends, sat in a corner behind the
jury bos, while WTaite's father and
brother Frank remained in the court
room.
When the jury come in Waite 'was
brought into the court room.
With his face pale and showing:
signs of nervousness he watched the
jurymen take their places. He star
ed at the jury without making any
movement as the foreman, replying to
the question of the clerk, said the ver
dict was "guilty."
New York, May 27. The summing
up of evidence against Dr. Arthur
Warren Waite in his trial for the mur
der of his father-in-law, John E.
Peck, of Grand Rapids, Mich., was con
cluded by both defense and prosecu
tion soon after noon today. Justice
Shearn then began his charge to the.
jury.
Justice Shearn completed his charge
at 1:20 p. m. and the jury went oat to
consider its verdict.
Makes Insanity Plea.
Mr. Deuil summed up for the de
fense. He said he did not think the
jurors would believe Waite was sane.
"Can a man who lived as he lived and
did as he did have any moral sense
whatsoever?" asked the attorney. "Is
there anything in his life's story to
show he ever had a moral sense and
lost it? No."
Enumerating the various crimes or
misdemeanors Waite had admitted,
Mr. Deuil asked if anything in Waite's
history marked him as a man ol in
telligence. "Why, Waite even signed the poison
register when he purchased arsenic,"
said Mr. Deuil. "It shows lack of in
tellectual sense. The manner in
which he killed Peck showed that he
lacked all emotional response. Waite
had no feeling.
"We cannot allow 'Waite to go at
large with the awful consequence of
his crime before us, hut we can re
move him from society by placing him
in an institution. If you should grant
that he be placed in an asylum, I
promise you that neither I nor any
member of his family will ever try to
get him out"
Prosecution Asks Conviction.
Assistant District Attorney Broth
ers, for the prosecution, said Waite
confessed his crimes only after hav
ing been confronted by indisputable
evidence. "What other defense did he
have except the plea of insanity?"
asked Mr. Brothers.
Describing Waite's plan to kill Peck
the prosecutor asked: "Was that an
insane act? If Mrs. Hardwick had
not sent the telegram to Percy Peck,
John Peck's body would have been
cremated, as was that of his wife. The
defendant had been premeditating
these murders for months.
