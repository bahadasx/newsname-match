Are You Getting Ready to Take
Better Care of That Young Stock
BV T. H. CASANOVA I
One of the greatest hand caps I
of raising live stock in this par
ish is the carrying of stock
throughthe three starvingmonths
of the winter until the grass is
strong enough to sustain them in
the spring. As a general thing
our. stock and undersized. because
with practically no food in the
winter they go on green grass in
the spring aln numbers are lost
'from weakness Our stock as a
general thing do not grow except
during the summer months and
if the insects are bad they do
not get much start until winter
comes to set them back in poor
-. sh The problem that pre
sents itself to the farmer is to
keep his stock in a growing con
dition throughout the winter so
as to put them in the pasture iit
good growing condition in the
spring Old rice straw stacks do
not giveyoung stock much growth
even though it keeps them alive
if the winter is not too severe.
Plant a good crop of cowpeas
now on every available acre and
be sure that you have enough

SI:iiter of malaria germns. The tsetse I ti
fly and sleeping sickness, a parti
g.ilarly deadly and incurable plague o
were found to be intimately as-,o- it
ciated in their labors. And the .
house-fly, instead of a mildly an- I
noying but harmless domtestic ani- e
mal, was uncloaked as a very enemy a
within our gates, purveying germn
of filth and disease beyond de,crip- a
tion. a
It used to be a popular custom f
o discover a use for every living i
reature and the sanitarians tell us It
fhat the fly's principal value is as C
a danger signal, indicating thel
presence of dirt in some formn. c
Wh.erever you find flies, there is I
clean-up work to be done, and the h
community which disriegards the a
warninR will not be among those i
boasting a low death-rate. a
Flies can not live except in dirt: I
it is their natural habitat. A real- t
lv well-fly as naturally prefers un. a
clean odors as fastidious people a
prefer sweet ones. Thley are bred (
t in garbage, manure, or similar c
a refuse; they derive their daily sus
tenance from it; and in due course i
they deposit their eggs in it -thus t
completing the cycle. When, then 1
c. a harmless-looking fly drops into,
your milk or cream pitcher, scram- t
bles about a little and slowly crawls
out again, he has bought a minute
e portion of the manure heap to your
breakfast table- minute but not so
minute as the millions of germs
which dwell in this same manure
Irtv-hich are transmitted with it.
A revolting thouigh? Decidedly so,
but-not more revolting nor nearly
so dleadly as the facts in the case.
