'BUTTING IN
LOCAL POLITIC
"Waggoner Attornoy, Father of Slain
Boy, Proposes to Stump County for
Any Man WIio Will Oppose Super
intendent Mcintosh.
I UiSBlfl
Jess. G. Watts of Waggoner, Okla
&6ma, a practicing lawyer of that
Wwn, and tho fathor oftho Watts boy
who was killed in a shooting scrnpo
iir 'tho "basement -of tho Waggoner
school houso and for -whoso murder
Corloy MsDarmont Is facing trial, la
"Credited with- the -statement hero
Monday that ho will stump tho coun
ty of Bryan for any man -who -will run
against County Suporintendont It. K.
Mcintosh for ro-oloctlon. Tho asser
tion, together -with much othre talk,
was mado Monday afternoon in tho
tailor shop of Bledsoo Brolhors, on
Third Avonuo, in tho prespneo of
"Slim" Bledsoo, Bon Cudd, Ralph
Daugherty, Reedy Jennings and oth
ers. Tho Btatoment with which
Watts Is credited is this: "If any of
you boys want to bo county superin
tendent, say tho word and I'll inako
you suporintendont. I'll slump tho
county for you and put lltoraturo in
tho hands of ovory voter." His pro
posal wnB rojoctod.
Mr. Watts -was hero ostensibly In
tho interest of securing witnesses to
aid in tho prosecution of McDarment,
out what success he had has not boon
learned. At tho time of tho tragedy
Mr. Watts was quoted that he wanted
McDarment to havo a fair trial in ov
ery senso of the word, but on tho
heels of this assertion ho is said to
haTO employed tho best counsel avail
able to assist tho county attornoy In
f tho prosecution. It appears that Mc
Darment was entirely without funds
and faces tho fato of going to trial
with only counrel appointed by tho
court, which In tho face of skilled at
torneys on the other side would mako
his chances exceedingly slim. Friends
of McDarraont's hero and elsewhere
took up a collection of voluntary sub
scriptions to assist him in producing
counsel, and attorneys now represent
him. It seems that Mr. Mcintosh in
terested himself In tho 'collection of
funds for tho dofense, or at least con
tributed a small sum himself, at
whleli Mr. Watts took cwpUon, and'
In retaliation now books, to rib sorao
guileless youngster to'fun for" county
superintendent in an effort to defeat
Mcintosh.
Watts' visit in the city and his
statements regarding Mcintosh and
.uIb candidacy have caused a feeling
It of rosentmont to show itself, and any
effort by Watts along tho lines indi
cated in the talk he Is said to have
K mado here Monday would arouse a
I torm of Indignation, as well as tho
resentment of the voters at largo In
tho county.
Tho question Is frocly asked here
that if Watts really wants to see Mr.
McDarment have a fair trial; why
: does ho seek tho defeat of a man who,
with others, aided the penniless de
fendant to employ counsel. His visit
and actions whllo here havo caused
much comment, mostly unfavorable,
and tho opinion Is oxpressed that tho
voters generally would take little
stock Jtf any propaganda which might
emlnato from that sourco,the. reas
ons for It being known.

will develop to tho nomination of

ceived so little encouragement that
ho is belloved to havo withdrawn any
activo opposition to tho nomination
of Mr. Wilson, t
Tho chief polntof interest In tho
convention centers around tho soloc-,

REPUBLICAN
CONVENTION
No Nomination. Hughes the Favor
itc.. Crowds Yell Eagerly for
Itoosoi'olt. Mopsersf Want Roose
velt or None.
Tho Republican National Conven
tion convened in Chicago Wednesday
with Senator Harding of-Ohio tempo
rary chairman, rind after a day's
work was no nearer a nomination
than before the convention conveod.
SOtlmont for Justice Hughes of tho
United Slates Supreme Court seems
to bo gaining, according to reports
received hero Thursday "morning. Tho
conven tlonwaswor klngquIetlyhtJ
convention Was working quietly,
while tho Bull Moose element wore
noisy and boisterous In their applause
of Roosevelt.
Early in tho wook the committee
from tho progressive wing of thr
party notified 'standpaU leaders that
they would fuse with the old guard
on tho agreed candidacy of Roose
velt, but this tho old guard seems to
have declined. Predictions are free
ly mado that Hughes will bo nominat
ed and that tho progressives, dissat
isfied, will nominato Roosevelt In
their own convention, and there will
bo threo tickets in the field this fall.
Friends of Ransevelt havo asked'
that ho come to Chicago to bo pres
ent at the convention. Should Roose
velt put in ana ppe'arance-, he con
servatives regard It as a sure sign of
a repltltion of tho 1912 bolt.

CATHOLIC SERVICES CLOSED.
The six day's courso of lectures
wrhlch wero being held In the Grlder
building the end of last week and tho
tlrst of this wook, uiujor the auspices
of thq local Catholic church, wore
woll attended at each session. Father
Xavior Sutton of Chicago, who con
ducted tho lectures, proved to be a
forceful and Instructive spoakor, and
tho result was that the building was
filled at each lecturo, many of tho
auditors being non-Catholics. Tho
-object of tho meetings was to ac
quaint tho local public with judt
what tho Catholic church stands for
and what its Is against and tho speak
er left no doubt as to that position.
Similar sorvices aro now being held
at 'Caddo in charge of tho Catholics

CITY TO SELL
LIGHT PLANT
New Contract Xtecommcndod With
Durant Ico and Light Co. for Oper
ation of Street Lights nnd Pump
ing Station.
Tho special committoo from tho
city council appointed to dicker wltU
tho Durant Ico and Light Company
for tho purchaso of tho city light,
plant, mado report to the counclf
Tuesday that the company was will
in? to pay the city for tho plant ?18,
000, of which one-fourth was to bo
paid in servlco, tho romalndor in
cash. Tho council will probably ac-
ccpt tho report." Ji. committee com
prising Messrs. McKinney, Blackwoll,
Newman and Loach, was appointed to
closo a contract with the company.
Tho plant originally cost tho city
about $24,000, and' the loss incurred :
in its operation plus maintenanco
probably r'uns tho city's Investment
up to $35,Q00. Tlfo plant is said to
be obsolots and $18,000 Is consider
ed a good price for it as it stands.
Tho city's oxporlonco with tho idda
satisfies business men that no smalt
town has any business going into thct
public utility business in compotioa
with private interests.
A new contract ia also recommend
ed with tho light company for tho
operation of tho street lights. Tho
present contract calls for a rate of
two conts a klllowatt hour for streot
lamps, the city to maintain the equip
ment. The now contract Is for $64 a
year on arc lights and $20 for fifty
candle power incadescent lamps, all
maintenance charges and Investment
to be carried by tho light company.
This Is equivalent to a rato of tWO
and one-half cents a klllowatt hour
and In viow of -tho fact that the com
pany Is to maintain the equipment, it
Is regarded as moro favorable to tho
city than tho old contract. For tho
samo service tho city of Dallas pays
$75 a yea'for arc lights and $24 for
the incaridescents. Tho contract pfo
vesfoi1 an all night schedule with
no'nlponllght stops. ,
In addition to the light plant mat
ter ha counclvoted to sond the city
engineer Jo7,Okfahoma City to see
Mesars. Swatech and Parkor about
the repairlug of Second Avcnuo,pav-"
Ing. It scorns that nltirorugtr'the'se'-
people agreed to repair the faulty
street, thattheir men havo been sim
ply smearing it ovor, which Is not'
satisfactory to tho Blty. Unless tho
contractors come across at once, tho
cltyTwill Bite on their maintenance
bofidt
Routine business, such as allowing
of monthly salaries and accounts was
dispatched.
LARGE PEANUT CROP.
Tho farmers of this section will
have a large crop of peanuts to mar
ket this fall and indications aro now
that the price will bo 65 conts to 75
conts per bushel. Tho Bo3well Cot
ton OH Company at Boswell, a branch
of the Durant Cotton Oil Company,
has a peanut cold press attachment
which was used Inst year very suc
cessfully, and most of the local pea
nuts will go there. This opens up a.
now flold In thfB section, as tho trou
ble has beon in the past that thero
was no market for tho peanuts aftor
they were grown. With this market
the fanners havo taken a groator in
terest In this crop.
A DESERVED PROMOTION.
Arthur N. Leecraft of Colbert, Bry
an County, who has been private sec
retary to Governor Williams since ho
took office, has been promoted to
member of tho State Board of Publl'j
Affairs, of which body he will bo sec
retary. This body buys all the sup
plies and equipment used by tho Stato

lection of Mr. Leecraft Is a signal rec
ognition of his business ability and
experience, and Is regarded as a da
served appointment.
