' AN ENGLISH BLIZZARD. '
It Took a Regiment of Soldier fc
Clear the Roads In, 1835,
There was a certain Hercules en
gine which ct a noble figure in the
English bliwird of 1S36. -
To appm ;ate the role played by
the Hercules some idea .mnst bo
given of the effect of ihe stnrm on
other iiietho-l of travel Fourteen
mail coaches we:v abrmdorld on as
many roads. Another v dng out
of drifts five timv lMtvcn Exeter
and London.
Another wo buried so dep that
it took 300 men. principally sappeiv
and miners, several hour? to make a
passage to the cnch and rescue the
mails and passengers, while near
Chatham the now lay to a depth of
thirty or fort feet, the military be
ing turned out to the number oi
600 to clear t; . wav.
In London the drifts were ten
feet deep, and hundreds of men and
carts were pti. ployed hauling snow
mit to the fichls in the suburbs. The
KHarVets wore in a bad way. One
day only four stall holders were
able to reach a main market. Greens
which a few dnvs before the storm
were being sold for threepence a
bunch at market now ietched Irora
tenpence to a Fhilling, turnips, car
rots and celery becoming equally
dear, wnüe penny handtuls oi pars
ley realized 2s. 6d., and the happy
possessor of a bunch which he had
previously purchased for ninepence
realized for his prize no less a sum
than 1 2s. od.
Amid all this confusion, the pio
neer railways covered themselvo
with glory by running trains almost
without interruption. There was a
deep cutting on oile line where the
snow had drifted badly, and great
numbers of people turned out to
see how the Hercules engine would
get along. They imagined, of course,
that she would be stopped, but to
their astonishment the engine dash
ed risrht into the drift "clearing
her way through apparently witrl
out the slightest difficulty, the ßnow
at the same time hying over the top
of the engine chimney like foam
from the broken waves of a violent
sea, and notwithstanding obstruc
tions the train came down from
Greenhead (twenty miles) in one
hour and a quarter." London
Queen.
Real Cause of Batdnett.
Coming in from East Liberty on
i train were two men who appar
ently were old acquaintances and
who met in a jovial mood. Both
men were quite gray, but each had
a luxuriant head of hair. Near
then sat a stout party with a shin
ing dome that was almost destitute
of hirsute covering.
The two friends exchanged face
tious remarks about silvered locks,
then indulged in some pleasantries
about the "thinning of the thatch'
with casual references to doorknobs
and billiard balls, much to tha
amusement of the passengers, but
to the evident discomfiture of the
baldheadcd man.
The talk 'inaily doveloped into an
argument the ause of baldness,
and aftrr considerable jocularity
the pair t imed to' Che pearly pated
stranger, and rpo. paid:
"My fr'.hd and I have been dis
cussing ti e '-au-o of baldness, but
we can't seem to Agree. Would you
mind telling us what you regard as
the real cuv.r.o of baldne??-7

his qi?tyttouei-j fiercely and snorted:
