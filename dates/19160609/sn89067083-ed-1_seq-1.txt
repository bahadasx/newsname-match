You can nearly always tease a

A Silo On Every Farm.
M. A. R. Kelley, Minouri Collegt of
, Agriculture.
; Practically every farmer has
planted crops this spring whioh
will furnish more feed if put into
the silo than if handled in any
other way. In most oases thsy
will also make more money, par
ticularly if the season should be
wet or late or both, as last year
was." i
A few statements from farm
letters will help tell why our slo
gan should be "A silo on every
farm" and why every Missouri
farmer should join those in the
state who have already built
about 10,000 silos. Some of them
say:
"I never fed any other feed aa
cheap as silage."
"I wouldn't be without ft silo.
Mine paid for Itself In two years."
"I praotioalty wintered twenty
head of stock on thirteen aores of
silage, and wouldn't have had
nearly enough if fed from the
field.",..,.-","'' "
A well-built silo of any type
will keep silage well, ao the cost
of different materials will in many
cases decide whether to buy or
build, and what type of silo to
seleot. In choosing, low first
oost, cheap maintenance, dura
bility, and smooth air-tight wall
should be demanded. Ordinarily
the more permanent silo should
be built.
Plans and instructions for
building oonorete silos may be
seoured from the College of Ag
rioulture, Columbia, Missouri,
and a circular giving full instruo
tions for building a Gorier silo is
also available.

Jim Milbank oaused consider
able exoitement in town Thurs
day by bringing in a six legged
hog. The hog weighed 310
pounds and had six legs, sure
enough. The extra legs hung
limp from the left side between
the natural legs. The pig was
farrowed with the extra legs, and
they grew and developed as tbe
hog grew, and were about the
sams size of ths natural ones, but
the animal had no use of them to
speak of. It was sure a curiosity.
Mr. Milbank got the hog of Mr.
Lytle, northeast of town, who
raised it, and shipped it to St.
Joseph Friday with a carload he
shipped down that day.
