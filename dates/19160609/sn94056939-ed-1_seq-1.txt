"Qftks White," -Democrat,
Scums to Ilavo Gruvo Fours
That His Party is Going
Down i DcTcatTh3 Fall
SAYS WILSON HAS EXHIBITED
A SHOW OF BACK BONE
You will excuso mo for taking
the liberty of addressing you thus
iinttllnl v. Mv iii'niniliiliitipn with
you being only in' your public
capacity is my excuse. It seems
to me 'that tho occasion Is para
mount.
wo as Domocrats know that wo
must do snmolhlng extraordinary
to win the coming national election.
Thero is nn tisu in beating birds
'(mind the bush While Mr. Wil
flbn has exhibited a show of buck
bono in tho submarino matter with
Germany, it was like hitting a man
wlion lie was down. Germany is
fighting tho world and could not
alTord to break wild the U S. It
was an opportune moment for Mr.
Wilson to exhibit a show of back
Irhne. On the other hand tho true
peaceful tendencies of tho man have
been shown in the Mexico matter.
Instead of back bono it has been
back down.
Now my proposition Is just this:
Here In tho Southwest the scull
incut is for stalwart doaling with
Mexico. The man of the largest
(jovelopenittiit .of cheek and brnvado
id iifiivi nc IInnabl'n I lnhlnninlii
w popular .Roosevelt. Domocrais
aro nil for him to be nominated by
the Republicans. He goes up ami
down tho country kuashing his
teeth and looking savage. He has
excrólsed his teeth so much becauso
tho U S. wouldn't fight that I hoy
are the must prominent feature of
his otherwise mild and lovely face
Setas they aro between cheeks that
hnvo tho world beaten for cheek
they remind mo of what Iloscne
Conklin said of him. Couklin was
At tho timo tho great leader of the
Republicana of tho Empire alato
Now York, while Roosevelt had
just started out on his brilliant
career as policeman, or sumo other
office In connection with the police
donsrtment of Now ork City
Someone suggested Roosevelt as lit
for (Bouiu office. Conklin said:
"Tliaj- -young man with the big
tenth? vHi thinks that ho discover
cd the tptrcOmmaudmentH.
This sentiment in the Southwest
has made me bold to address you
You, of.courae, couldn't do other
wise than' advocate a bold pulley in
our luHonal unnvaniiou. You
would bo going contrary to public
sentlmout in your own state to .ad
vocato peace at any price, then
jeopardising your poli oJl íutitro..
Un tho other hand the only enanco
for our party to win is in atf(ming
o platform for peace oven iwo
have to run for it. 1 call to my
support on this proposition no less
a person than Win. J. Hryau. who
has peerlessly carried our business
in three campaigns. Ho saym tho
only olisnoo the Democrat have to
win is by throwing out frotñ our
sinking ship a bait to catch the
peace lovlne Republicans
At a warrior candidato Wilson
would lie boaten tn a frazzle. Ho
can easily stand on a peace plat
form. He is never bound by his
platform. We cannot disgulao the
fact if we would, that he Is the
logical candidate. Every man of
our party of statue sufficient to
aspire to the great office is willing
to stand aside and tw Wilson lead
tbo forlorn hope. I

is. in proving mi alibi. 1 it in willing

Ho loved his sweetheart fondly and
keenly felt her Iohs. But Hans had
not tho money to pay her way
across. So Wilholima waited and
Snyder waited too, because in their

Hans Snyder read about how Hi nit

Hans stood at the station gate, to

Rill Hrvnn is in the hsiiio pre
