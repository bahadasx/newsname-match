nine Poem Found on Body Re
flects Domestic Trouble That Caus
ed Tragedy.
TUCSON, June 3. No Inquest will
be held In the' case of Fred M. Cal
vert, of Pittsburg, Pa., who swallow
ed strychnine and died at the Wind
sor hotel this week, according to an.
announcement by the coroner to
day. Arrangements for the funeral
have not been announced pending
-word from the man's relatives . in
Pittsburg-
Domestic trouble, which arose over
the children of his wife by a former
husband, and caused a separation, led
to the suicide, it is thought. Just
when the tragedy occurred is not
known, but it is thought that Calvert
drank the poison early- yesterday
morning. A chambermaid who knock
ed at his door at 3 o'clock yesterday
afternoon received no response. The
proprietor of the hotel summoned
peered through a transom and saw
Calvert's body lying across the bed.
At 3:30 o'clock. Coroner Comstock
was called and the door of the room
was forced- Calvert had been dead
some time. Beside his body was an
empty bottle that had contained
strychnine, and a note across the
front page of a note book to "notify
Mrs. Oney Mae Calvert, 159 East
Pennington street."
According to Mrs. Calvert, who was
hastily summoned, she bad parted
irom her husband In the east and had
come to Tucson in April to live with
her sister. He had followed her here
a week ago, and endeavored to effect
a reconciliation.
Tuesday evening they attended a
theatre, registering later at the Win-
sor hotel as Mr. and Mrs. William
McMillan, of El Paso. She left her
husband at 6 o'clock Wednesda
morning, she says. At that time,
Calvert, who had told her that he had
secured a position outside of Tucson,
remarked that they might take him
home In a "box." s. . .
According to the wife the trouble
between her and her husband arose
over her children by a former mar
riage. By a prenuptial arrangement
he had agreed that In the. event that
there should be trouble between
them on account of the children, he
should be the one to go.
That the man may have intended to
kill both his wife and himself is indi
cated by a poem written in his note
book as follows:
I have lived this world as best I
could
Have had my happy days and all, !
But to me now all I can see
Is darkness and misery.
I loved my wife and little home.
The happiest in the world,
Till one day a cloud came o'er It all
And this is what it has brought
to me.,
I cannot stand to live alone
And wander o'er this world in
gloom, ' .
60 I am leaving it and taking one I
love along. '
Recently Calvert purchased a re
volver, his wife told the coroner, and
had threatened to kill himself, hut
she had dissuaded him. The revolver
was not found among his effects. In
tils notebook were .several other
poems and verses all of - which were
apparently inspired by his love . for
bis wife. - -' -
Calvert was 34 years old. He had
been a salesman. '

PHOENIX, June 3. Advancing the
theory that E. S. Clark, of Phoenix,
will orew to the republican ticket a
larger majority of the dry vote than
Hon. Thomas E. Campbell, support
ers of the Yavapai attorney are quiet
ly talking him up In Maricopa. Re
cognizing the already well developed
strength of the tax commissioner,
however, they are trying to make a
place for him on the republican ticket
as the fall opponent of Henry F. Ash
urn for the United States senate.
Oddly enough, " both Mr. Campbell
and Mr. Clark are of Prescott, and
the adjourned session, of the republi
can s'.ate convention, which will de
cide which is to be put forward as
the party's gubernatorial candidate
this fall will convene in Prescott on
July 6.
Thus, the second meeting of the del
egates, hitherto regarded as most en
tirely formal, may develop a contest.
For those who are supporting the
Clark claims are already talking of a
"frogram."
BALL GARDE AT
MDRENGI SUNDAY
Morenci Accepts Clifton's Challenge
and First Game witn him cty Boys
Will Be Played at Morenci Sunday ,
Smarting from the stinging defeat
administered at the hands of the .
2?nd Infantry a couple of weeks ago, :
the Clifton ball team are determined
to take their revenge out on someone j
and as a consequence they have cen-
tered on their close neighbors and old I
time rivals, Morenci. The first blood
of the season will be spilled on the
Morenci diamond Sunday, June 11th,
at which time the takers of Clifton s
challenge are expected to suffer the
worst defeat of their existence at the
hands of Rley's Ripsnorters. .
The grounds of- execution at Mo
renci 'have been put in first class con
dition for the slaughter and it is ex
pected that one of the most ferocious
encounters in the history of base
balldom In the .Clifton-Morenci dist
rict will be pulled off Sunday . The
Morenci boys also have a grievance
and have been fretting themselves
into a state of nervous prostration
over the poetical effusions of a Clifton
fan In which they were challenged
to the combat. It is understood that
they; have been practicing night and
day for the big battle and Manager
Bury and Capt. Shanley are antici
pating a never-to-be-forgotten love
feast at the close of the strife to
commemorate the annihilation of the
Clifton bunch.. .
The Morenci boys are all home
players and they guarantee with suf
ficient team work to clean np any
thing that opposes them in this sec
tion of the country. A good amount
of work has been done In getting the
Morenci grounds in shape and when
finished this will be one of the fastest
diamonds in the southwest.
The Clifton team has been rein
forced by the arrival of Jennings.wbo
has lately been occupying third base
for " Lordsburg and who promises to
give a good account of himself both
at third and with the stick. Another
new addition to the team which will
greatly strengthen it is the arrival of
Eaton from El Paso. He was form
erly in the big league circuit playing
with Cinqinnatti and later joining
the Texas" aggregation-: With these
additions and the material already at
hand there Is no doubt but what Clif
ton will put up a good game the com
ing season.
A change in the management of the
local team has taken place this week
whereby Max Juelg, better known as
the Fat Kid, has succeeded Pete
Riley. The new manager means
business from the start and is taking
j a great deal of interest 'in the sport
I and intends to bring out the best
j there is in the material at hand He
Is already negotiating for games with
outside teams and some classy ball
may be expected in the future.

TUESDAY NIGHT
City Father Assume New Offices.
Several Petitions Presented to the
Council for Consideration.
The inauguration Into office of the
new town council which was to have ,
taken place on Monday night, was ,
postponed until Tuesday evening at j
which time all town officers assumed
their new duties upon the retirement
of the outgoing officials.
Upon taking office the new City
Council immediately proceeded to
business, the first order of which J
was the selection of one of their
number for the office of mayor. This '
proposition was unanimously conced-
ed to Arthur Slaughter, and hereafter
it will be Mayor Slaughter. v
Six petitions were submitted to
the Council for consideration by;
the. lady -voters of Clifton- asking for
the appointment of Mrs. Deck, lady
member of the Council, as president
of that body. The petitions were
circulated the first of the week and
were signed by a large number of
names. The women were or the
opinion that so long as one of their
sex was elected to the council by a
good sized vote she deserved the
right to be placed at the head of the
aldermanic body as president, and
their efforts were concentrated on
this one object. Upon taking a
vote, (however, the Council decided
upon O. J. Cotey as president of the
body.
The town officers now stand, Mayor,
Arthur Slaughter; President, of the
Council, O. J. Cotey; Members, Mrs.
Joe Deck, F. H. Springer, C. W.
Young, Richard Stephens, and Walter
Tappin, Sr.; Street Supervisor, B.
Vandercook; Marshal, G. L. Craw
ford; Town Clerk, Mat Danenhauer.
The new Council lost no time in
getting into the harness and several
items of business were taken up at
their first meeting, - chief among
which was the question of salaries
for the coming term. It was de
cided that the old salaries should
stand as they were heretofore with
later a possible raise for the minor
employees of the city.
From all indications the new admin
istration stand for everything in the
line of betterment for the town and
the questions of eewerage, new
bridges and adequate fire protection
will be taken up by them at an early
date and improvements of a substan
tial nature is expected to be the rule
from now on.
The Council also made the following
appointments: M. M. Smith, night
marshal; Dave Ling town attorney.
and Dr. L. A. W. Burtch, health In
spector.

FIRE DEPARTMENT
. RECEIVES MONEY
Apportionment of $227.20 Received
from State Fire Boys to Hold
Meeting on Evening of June 15th
The Clifton Volunteer Fire Depart
ment are this week in receipt' of a
check for $227.20 which waa received
from the State department at Phoenix.
Under a new ruling which recently
went into effect one per cent of the
gross earnings of insurance companies
doing business in incorporated towns
of 3000 or more population are turned
over to the state. The state then ap
portions such money available to the
incorporated towns of more than 8000
population and the amount is turned
over to the fire departments of each
town to be used by them as they
deem necessary... Clifton'B apportion
ment fr-m this source was the check
for $22 K'i hV hau bo -ddpodud
to the credit of the local department,
and the disposition of the fund will
rest in their hands.
The local fire boys will hold a meet
ing at the Town Hall on the evening
of June 15th for the purpose of elect
ing officers and making arrangements
for practices to be held for the Fourth
of July and Labor Day races which
will be held during these two big
celebrations. Interest in the organi
zation has been in a comatose con
dition for some time but with the
newly acquired donation and the
coming races to be held on July 4th
and Labor Day, the boys are beginning
to sit up and take notice and from
now on will take a renewed interest
in the affairs of the association.
The question of a new up-to-date
motor fire truck has for some time
been discussed by members of the
fire association and interested parties
on the outside, and It is likely that in
the near future the apparatus will
be acquired. The outfit would consist
of a motor truck which would accomo
date a sufficient quantity of hose and
chemical fire extinguishers for all pur
poses. The new apparatus would
necessitate the services of a paid
fireman to stay with the machine
night and day and thus give the peo
ple better fire protection than they
have ever had before. With one of
these trucks in commission in the
past many of the disastrous fires
we have experienced might (have
been checked at the beginning and a
great property loss saved to many In
dividuals. This question will probably be
threshed out at the coming meeting
and if the way is made clear for the
purchase of the machine it will be
one of 'the best Investments that could
be made by the city.

A BIG CATTLE
SHIPMENT
MADE
Clifton has this week been full of
cowpunchers and cattlemen, who as
usual have made things lively for
several days. They arrived in town
Saturday evening accompanying a
large drive of cattle from the Blue
and Eagle country which were ship
ped to points in Texas the first of the
week. The herd contained cattle
from several shippers from the north
ern end of the county and is the
largest which has been driven down
'Frisco for some time, the bunch con
sisting of some 1500 head.
The herd spent Saturday night a
short distance above Clifton and
about six o'clock Sunday morning was
moved down the 'Frisco to the pens
at North Siding to the yells of the
cowboys and the numerous noises at
tendant upon Buch an occasion.. The
cattle arrived here in good condition
and were loaded Into the cars for
shipment Monday.
Those who had an interest in the
shipment Included J. H. T. Cosper,
Geo. Montgomery, John D. Patty,
Dick Miller, John Brown, Jobn Fiili
man, Schwab, Suthevlin, Gatlin, Zum
walt. Dud Elrage, Stacey and Laney.
The cowmen report that the range
is In good condition regardless of the
hot winds which have prevailed for
several weeks and that water on the
Blue Range and in the Eagle section
is abundant, and they all look for an
exceptional year for the cattle inter
ests.
As a windup for their long drive the
cowboys gave a dance to their Clifton
friends at the Princess on Tuesday,
night which was attended by a large
crowd. The boys whooped it up un
til a late hour and those present will
long remember . their hospitality.
Adams' orchestra furnished the music
while Bill Gatlin acted as floor
manager for the hosts and did the hon
ors in a masterly style. Square
dances, the puncher's . delight, pre
dominated, and in these the boys
were at their best, their stiff joints '
seemed to be automatically loosened
and what they did to the different
figures showed them to be past mast
ers of the Terpsichorean art. In these
dances Bill Zumwalt showed bril
liantly as cl!er and to him is due
a ureai. deakof cidir. tor tbf burcovi
of the' affair. " -J
The dance, although being a rather
impromptu affair was nevertheless
heartily enjoyed by everyone and
they hope the boys will repeat the
dose upon their next visit to Clifton.
Visitor from Phoenix
Mrs. C. P. Dunn and daughter,
Florence, of Phoenix, arrived in Clif
ton Monday evening and will spend
a couple of months with Mrs. Dunn's
mother, Mrs. Brutinel.

PASSES AWAY
Matron at Arizona Copper Company
Hospital Succumbs After Short II
ness Body Shipped to Berkeley,
California for Interment.
News of the death of Miss Marv
Marks, matron at the A. C. hospital,
early Monday morning was a distinct
shock to her many Clifton friends.
The announcement came as a surprise
to many as her illness was of short
duration and her death was not ex
pected . She was afflicted with peri
tonitis and it was this which caused
her demise.
The remains were taken to the Pas
coe Undertaking Parlors and prepar
ed for shipment to her old home in
Berkeley, Cal. Dr. T. B. ' Smith
accompanied the body to Los Ange
les Wednesday morning where It will
be met by a sister of the deceased
and from there taken to Berkeley
for interment.
Miss Marks came to Clifton about
seven years ago from California and
accepted a position as nurse in the
Arizona Copper company hospital,
later taking charge of the nursing
staf as matron. Through her kind
ly disposition and pleasant personality
she soon gained a wide circle of
friends to whom she endeared herself
to the end and who will ever remem
ber her with the kindest of thoughts.
Sho always took an active part In
social affairs, as much as her duties
would allow, and ber cheerful pres
ence will be sadly missed by these
friends with whom she was most
popular.
In her profession her cheerfulness
and loving disposition did much to
ward the recovery of those who were
entrusted to her care and these kind
ly attributes gave comfort and hope
to many a body racked with pain, and
acted as a sedative to the nerve
shattered patient. In the passing of
such a character the suffering have
lost a valuable friend while' those left
behind, among whom she numbered
friends by the score, will feel her
loss Immeasurably.
In the passing of Miss Marks the
whole community mourns the taking
away of a good and noble woman
whose mission in life was to relieve
suffering and bring a ray of sunshine
into the lives of the afflicted.
A. T. Wilson, manager of the Dou
ble Circle ranch, was In town a few
days the latter part of the week. Mr.
Wilson came to Clifton to meet his
wife and son who returned from Cali
fornia Friday evening.

It is the intention of the Clifton Elks
to build a meeting place of their own
at a cost of some $30,000 and the
question has been brought up from
time to time but now the members
have taken a renewed Interest in the
subject and plans are going to be

will he erected on the vacant lot next
to the Sirianni building which would
be centrally located and an ideal
place for such a purpose.
FATAL SHOOTING

Frank Thompson, Mining Man.
GLOBE. June 3. A dispute over
mining claims that began seven years
ago between Wm. Sparks, a pioneer
prospector and former sergeant of the
Arizona rangers, and Frank Thompson
a wealthy mining man, terminated on
the main street of Globe today, when
Sparks shot and killed Thompson.
The old prospector was standing on
the street when he noticed Thompson
approaching. He drew an automatic
revolver and shot five times. Each
bullet was effective.
Sparks surendered to the authori
ties and stated he shot because
Thompson (had been threatening his
life.
