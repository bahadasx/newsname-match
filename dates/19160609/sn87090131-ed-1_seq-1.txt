THE WEBSTER-PARKMAN CASE. a h
thao
No modern crime is more celebrated mal
than the murder of Dr. George Park- at
man by Prof. John W. Webster of go
Harvard college. This because both qui,
the slayer and the slain were distin- con
gished men, and also by reason oheerfuhe
the ountequely horrible circumstances otha
attending the crimet that he wore
Doctor Parkman was a wealthy and ent
widely tnown chairen of chemBoston, and
at the time of his removal was sixty
years o ae. He was a man oMedica most
peculiar appearance. His face was
unusually long, and terminated in a
sharp chin, protruding to such an ex
tent that Doct seemed a deisappearedty. His
head was bald and down the center of
it ran a huge cranial ridge, suggesting
that his skumll had been soldered to
gether by a poor workman. He was
thin and tall, enjoyed exthcellen health,
end laughs remarkably active and ener
getic for one o hi ng coueas.
Webster wNext an entirely diffhoweverent
type of man, being short, round and
heavy set, with a rosy and cheeimMrs.ul
countenance. He was iopular, not
nithsthe din the pact that he wore
side whiskers, and his attainments
may be judged rom the fract that he
held the chair of chemistry at Har
vard, and also intraced to the Boston Medical
college, where he had private offices
thand laboratornished from the face of the.
It was on Friday, November 23, 189,nd
that Doctor Parkman disappeared. an
He was a man of such regular habits
that the neighbors set their cloceks by
him, and when he failed to come home
for dinner his wife was much
arlarmed, She told the neighbors, but
they laughed at her fears, and per- l
suaded ther that nothing could be pr
wrong. tNext morning, however, the
doctor still being absent, and no mes- ev
sage having come from him, Mrs. stk
Parkman was seriously disturbed, an
and she notified the police. Then a ne
systemtic search waves conducted r th
days together, but without results. W
The doctor was traced to the Boston d
Medical college, and there it seemed dr
that he vanished from the face of the g
earth. s a
It was known that the doctor and te

wH paid the money, and the note was b t(
vcanceled, and Parkman left his of
* fice, and that wa all he tnew about m
moft Oi canrse it was absurd to sup- d
pose that the professor knew anything to
the sake of appearance, and to satisy o m
the public mind, which was excited to Io
permisson to search the professorts
quarters at the college. The permis
where, and begged them to make their 14
man named Ulttisfield sad he had the li(
qualifications ou a aseutn. As au went
about his work day by day he medi
tated and brooded over various things
he had noticed, and he put two and
two together in his mind, and con
cluded that they made four, and he
determined to investigate. Why did
the able and gifted professor keep his
doors locked all the time? Why did
he keep up great fire in the assay
furnaces at all sorts of unholy hours?
These t)ln were auspicious. Watch
ing his opportunities, the Janitor
broke' through a brick wall into a
vault under the laboratoteas, and there
found'~arts of a humal body. Again
he examined the ashes dad clinkers
from the furnaces, and found what he
took to be bones. Among the things
found were particles of gold, a hu
man tooth, part of a set of false teeth.
The abnormally long jaw of the miss
ing man made identilcation easy and
certain. Parkman's dentist recognized
the false teeth at once.
When these discoveries were made
known to the authorities, Webster had
gone home after a day of arduous toil
in chemical research, and was resting
in the bosom of his family. It was de
cided to arrest him at once, and two
or three officers went to his home in
a hack. They explained to Webster
that they considered it necessary to
make another search of his quarters
at the college and requested him to
go with them. He pretended to be
quite at his ease, and agreed to ac
company the officers with his usual
cheerfulness, but there is no doubt
that he suspected the truth and real
ized that the truth was known. After
entering the hack with the officers he

swallowed something, and when they
arrived at the jail he was frothing at
the mouth and almost in conrulsions.
The poison he had taken, whatever
it was, caused him a great deal of
t physical anguish, but failed to end his
life, which was the consummation he
probably wished.
His trial lasted eleven days, and the
evidence against him, though circum
stantial, was conclusive. Many learned
and distinguished men took the wit
ness stand, testifying for or against
the prisoner, among them being Oliver
Wendell Holmes. Webster was found
guilty and sentenced to death. He ad
dressed the jury and tried to explain
e away the evidence against him, but
his talk was not convincing.
He was in great anguish of mind
when returned to his prison. The
fortitude he had displayed during the
trial deserted him, and he became a
rather pitiable object. Application
was made to the governor for a com
mutation of sentence, and in support
of this application Webster made a
confession he declared to be true. He
adnitted having killed Parkman, but
insisted that the crime was unpremed
itated, and that he suffered great
provocation.
According to his story he owed
Parkman money which he was unable
to pay at that time. Parkman aeslled
at his office on the fateful Friday and
was very angry because Webster didn't
have the money ready. Webster be
gan to make an appeal for more time,
but the visitor was furiously angry,
and upbraided him in the bitterest
terms, applying the most contemptu
ous epithets. "At last," said Webster,
"his fury became almost maniacal and,
unable longer to endure it, when he
thrust his fist immediately in my face.
I struck him over the head with a
stick. The blow was upon the temple,
and he fell heavily to the floor. Every
.effort to resuscitate him was in vain,
d and in the agony attendant upon the
o discovery that I was a murderer, my
e. first thought was how to conceal the
L body."
f- His petition for clemency failed to
t move the governor, and one doleful
p- day he walked in fear and trembling
g to the gallows tree, and his name was
>r added to the long list of distinguished
ry men who, through some moral or
to mental crook, have brought them
d selves into that shadow of disgrace
a which "shall be lifted nevermore."
