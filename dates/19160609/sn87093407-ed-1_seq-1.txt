Hughes Believed Probable
Choice of G. 0. P.; May
Not Finish Voting Until
Saturday.
COLISEUM. CHICAGO. !une o In spite nf the fact
that the conference committee* of the two conventions are
to hold another meeting this afternoon, it was the consensus
of opinion among leader* of the republican national conven
tion today that Justice Hughes will he the party's nominee
It was just as iilOliy believed that the would
never give up the idea of nominating Roosevelt, and indica
tions this afternoon are that there will be three parties in
the field, utiles*, of course, Roosevelt should stamp the nonii
nation of the mpreme court justice with hi* approval and
yield in his favor.
Nominations were begun shortly before noon today, and
the convention enjoyed its first outbreak of old-time en
thusiasm.
Gov. Whitman of New York nominated Justice Hughes
During his speech he mentioned the name of Taft, and
got a real demonstration. Delegates all over the hall stood
up, waved their hats, and yelled wildly. The outburst con
tinued five minutes and was silenced only by the effort* of
the band.
When Root's name was placed before the convention,
Chauncey M. Depew climbed onto his chair and led the
demonstration
The hats of the respective "favorite -ons" then were
hurled into the ring, with lots of oratory, and demonstrations
of varying length. The voting was scheduled to start when
the nominating speeches were concluded.
The greatest demonstration to date came when Whit
man finished his nominating speech at 12:12, not mentioning
Hughes' name until the last words of his speech. I hen the
din broke loose.
The Vermont delegates were the real cheer leaders
They stood on their chairs ami whooped it up strong.
Oregon's Representatives—the only delegates instructed
for Hughes, were hardly second in their enthusiasm.
The band was started in an effort to Mop the noise, but
only succeeded in adding emphasis to the din
Henry G. Beyer of Portland, Me., produced a paper mache
elephant which he carried aloft down the main aisle, causing
another tremendous outbreak The Oregon crowd started
parading on the floor. The Vermont delegates got the fever
at the same moment.
Mississippi camt next, the delegates rooting up their
standard and marching along;, a raving, cheering mob.
Oregon's standard, held aloft, was covered with red
Hughes banners'. Michigan followed next it bring perfectly
apparent from their demeanor that they were not Ford
pacificists, even if instructed to vote for the automobile man
They got a good deal of good-natured kidding as thrv
marched, -ome delegates mockingly adding to the general
uproar by cheering for "Ford."
At 12:19 the demonstration subsided a little and the band
stopped, a little exhausted, but a moment later four New York
delegates, standing on chairs, and led by some one with a
watchman's rattle, organized a cheering gang <-«id rent the
air with shouts of "Hughes! Hughes!" It was taken tip all
over the hall. The one-syllable Irurst forth again and again

ney'! wife. Is on trial, charged

She chastised Mrs. Jones
with an umbrella on the street
In front of the Sevoy hotel, on
April 24, but Is stklng a jury of
five men to acquit her on the

flable.
Meeilng unexpectedly. Mr* AHen
tare Mr* Jone.e sneered at her.
Hhe then raised her umbrella and
struck Mrs Jorie* over the head
He Didn't Help Her
"Mrs. Jones cried for help, cover
Ins her face with ber arms and
hacking towards the door of a Jew
elry store," said Kidney (irosa, an
eye witness "Her hat was all
crushed and her face bleeding Be-
In* married and having plenty of
trouble of my own at home. I didn't
go to lier assistance "
"I think discretion the better

of Hughes, Burton, Fairbanks,

"Your committee, appointed
pursuant to the resolution
adopted at yesterday's session,
met In conference with a com

al progressive convention last

"The conferees were of one
mind In believing that the good
of the country, and perhapa its
repute and influence for years
to come, depends upon the con
trol of the executive and leglt
latlve branches of the govern

lieve in and will execute the
policies that are so heartily sup

progressive parties.
"The progressive conferees
were unanimous In urging, with
fairness, the opinion that Roose
velt of New York had so large
a personal following and such a
close personal relation to the
issues of the coming campaign
as to make him the most desir
able condidate upon whom to
unite.
"It was agreed that your con

United Press Staff Correspondent
AUDITORIUM, CHICAGO,
June 9.—While the progressive
convention held In check its
"Roosevelt today eplrit," Sen.
W. R. Borah of .daho appeared
before the progressive* today
with what many of the dele
gate* believe wa( an "eHyv"*
branch" from the 0. O. P.
When the progressives ro
cessed until 3 p. m. it waa with
the understanding that the
Roosevelt stampede would be
held up until after the pro
gressive and republican c««-
ferees got together this
noon for another session.
Both the progressive and repnV
Mean conventions seem to work
along parallel llnea to the minute.
Telephones between the conven
tion halls notified each of the oth
er's moves snd the conference
business seemed to be conducted
on a clock work schedule.
Borah Makea Speech
Rome of the radicals said the
nomination of Roosevelt will come
tonight unless the republicans
agree to take him.
"1 do not visit you in an official
capacity." Borah said in his
speech "I think I know something
of the spirit of this convention. It
is pretty well known tTiat I have a
deep seated admiration for your
great leader. Theodore Roosevelt."
The crowd went wild.
"We want Teddy," they shouted,
starting the noisiest demonstrattoa
of the day It lasted four minutes.
"There is no doubt," said Borah,
"that Tftu want Teddy.
Must Work Together
"I have no doubt there are mil
lions of people who want him, too.
I can say with entire truth that
you are fortunate in having a lead
er who, in my humble judgment,
has done more than any other 500
men In the I'nited States to make
the issue that this campaign Is
bagrd upon.
"He is accepted as a master of
our international problems.
"But. my friends, let us bear In
mind what these two conventions
Fhall do here will perhaps decide
the destiny of the country for the
next 25 years.
Cry tor Roosevelt
"We can secure results only by
working together.
' I would not be true to ray con
victions if I did not say to you that
it is essential that it shall be de
termined that we shall march to
gether and fight together in this
election.
"Who shall lead us?"
"Teddy," shouted the crowd. "If
your convention and mine should
agree on your great leader," Borah
concluded, "there would be no
more enthusiastic supporter for
Roosevelt than myself."
When Borah took the platform
lie was greeted with cries of, "Now
come on home, Bill."
The delegates were cheering and
singing, as usual, when they enter
ed the hull.
While the conference committed
delayed their arrival, several dele
gates. Including Charles E. Mason
of Maine, were permitted to speak.
Will Delay Nomination
Henry .1. Allen of Kansas, radical
leader, suid his faction had deter
mined to delay the nomination of
Roosevelt until the conference com
mittee had had more time to act,
"We will start, tho. the mlnut*
the republicans begin balloting,"
he said.
The progressive committee reach
ed the Auditorium platform at
11:30 nnd consideration of the
platform was suspended while
Chairman Perkins reported for the
conferees.
