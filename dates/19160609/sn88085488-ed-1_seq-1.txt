I pinner in Tanglewood Next
A pi Tuesday
"We must congratulate the Pull
man business men for taking the in
itiative and extending an invitation
that should have come from us. It
will be a pleasure to secure, not a
few dozen Colfax residents, and per
haps not a few thousands of them,
but at least a few hundred to accept
the Invitation extended by the Pull- j
I man Chamber of Commerce." Thus
spoke Dr. J. Floyd Tift at the meet-!
ing 0 the Colfax Commercial club,!
held Wednesday, when M. J. Chap
man and M. S. Jamar, acting upon
authority of the Pullman Chamber of
Commerce, extended an invitation to
the members of the Colfax Commer
cial club and their ladies to come to |
Pullman,next Tuesday, June 13, and!
partake of the hospitality of the I
Pullman boosters. .
Extensive plans are being made for j
the joint meeting, which is designed
to promote a better feeling between
the people of the two towns, and
every effort will be made to prove to ;
the citizens of the county seat that
Pullman is ready and willing to bury !
the hatchet and forget all past dif- 1
ferences.
The Colfax citizens will arrive
Tuesday morning, coming in automo
biles, and will spend the time until
noon in mingling with the local busi
ness men. At JBtoo o'clock the vis
itors, together with the members of
the Pullman chamber and their,
ladies, will go to Tanglewood, the
' beautiful picnic ground on the col
lege campus, where a sumptuous pic-,
nic dinner will be served in honor of j
the visitors. Following the dinner
the Colfax people will be taken in ]
charge by committees from the State
College and will go on a tour of in- j
spection of the college campus, build-:
ings and experiment station farm.
The invitation to the Colfax boost- !
ers was presented by a committee I
from the local chamber, consisting of '
J.W. Mathews, M. J. Chapman, M. S. |
Jamar and George H. Watt, who I
journeyed to the county seat for that j
purpose Wednesday. The invitation '
met with a hearty welcome, and ex-!
pressions of thanks were made by j
several members of the Colfax club, j
A committee, consisting of Thos.
Neill, E. M. Woodln, Porter T. Crock
er, V. T. McCroskey and L. L. Brun- j
Ing was appointed to ascertain as I
nearly as possible the exact number !
who will make the trip from the <
county seat and a report will be :
made to the Pullman chamber before i
Monday, so that arrangements can
be made to have a big enough feed
.on hand to take care of the entire
crowd handily.
George T. McMahon is chairman of
the Pullman committee in charge of j
arrangements for the big "love!
feast."
COMPANY HIST MAKE CHANGES
The bill of the 0.-W. R. & N. com-'
Pany for $263.57, the city's one-fifth
of the cost of the improvement on j
th Kamiaken street bridge and its!
approaches, will not be paid by the
«Ity council until the company com-1
Plies with the plans and specif j
"ons as prepared by the city to gov- j
crn the improvement. It is alleged ;
that the bridge is narrower in one j
Place than the specifications permit- |
ed, thus throwing the walks out of j
ne- The total cost of the improve- ;
ment was $1317.93, according to the
a ßures submitted by the company,!

! FORMER GOVERNOR I
VISITS PULLMAN
j Ex-Governor Henry Mcßrlde of
I Seattle baa been making a tour of
j Whitman county this week in the in
| terests of his candidacy tor the re
: publican nomination for governor,
j •ie met with a very cordial recep
tion from the rank and file of his
i party, who have not forgotten the'
j strenuous fight he made during his
I administration for a railroad com- 1
\ mission and his fearless use of the :
veto power in lopping off extrava- j
! gant appropriations made by the i
•legislature of 1903. He was defeat
led for the nomination by the railroad :
lobby and party machine in 1904,
I but the sentiment which he and the
. democratic party had aroused Tor
railroad regulation was so strong
j that a hill creating a railroad com- j
mission was passed at the next ses
sion of the legislature. Mr. Mcßrlde
I was in Pullman Tuesday and found
many supporters who remembered I
the friendly attitude which he always]
maintained toward the- state- College j
and the valuable services which he
rendered that Institution during his I
i term as governor.

The semi-annual report of Secre
tary XV, M. Porter of the Chamber

the luncheons during the past six
months having been 42, or almost
double the average (attendance !at
the former evening sessions. Twenty
two new members were added to the
I roll during tin- period covered by!

through removal from the city. A j
total of 5000 pieces of mail matter,
largely of an advertising nature,
have been sent out from the chamber
headquarters during the term,

VISIONS OF VIADUCT !
VANISH OVERNIGHT
Council Proceeds With Paving Plans
and Viaduct Goes (Jliinmci-ing—
Width ..I' Paving Reduced
Tiring of '.'watchful waiting," the 1
city council Tuesday evening passed
an ordinancel creating Local Im- ;
provement District No. 27 and will
proceed at once with the- in prove
ment, by paving, grading and park
ing, of the Spring street extension ol !
Main street, from th.- new concrete
bridge eastward to the city limits. j
By this action the hopes of th.- .it
izens who were clamoring for the
construction of a viaduct to conned
: tin- two parts of Main street are
! shattered, tor the time being st least.
The preliminary re-solution declaring
tin' Intention of the city to Improve
Spring street was adopted two
months ago and tin- estimate of cost
was prepared by engineer Edwards, i
Scon afterward the viaduct talk!
started and the council rested on It! I
j oars, believing that the two raHroad
companies or the state public service
| commission, or all of them, might
j take action toward condemning and
| eliminating the five dangerous rail-
I road crossings on Spring street, thus
j making the viaduct necessary and l
I removing the necessity for the Im- ,
provement of Spring street. No j
such action was taken and the coun
cil will proceed with the improve
ment, bids for the work to be opened
June 20.
Th.- objection to the improvement j
| filed by the 0.-W. R. & N. Co, which, |
| with the Northern Pacific, must'
stand the greater part of the cost,
was withdrawn when the council re
duced the width of the proposed pav
ing from ■'!<> to 24 feet.
The council also passed an ordi
nance covering the paving of South
Grand street, District No. 28, and!
bids for this improvement will be |
opened on the same date an those I
for District No. 27.

a farewell for the Misses Grace Yeo: i

THIRTY BLOCKS ADDED
i TO PAVING PROGRAM
Council Proposes to Pave I litis
I Blocks on Methodist Hill, All of
North State Street and Church
Street District
i
I Thirty blocks of paving were add
ied to Pullman's extensive Improve-
I ment campaign Tuesday evening
when the city council adopted resolu
tions declaring its Intention to pave
three new districts, aggregating that
amount, as well as placing its final
Stamp of approval on the Spring
street Und East Grand street dis
tricts. The largest of the three new
districts includes parts of seven
streets on Methodist hill, An en
larged district will be created, and
the cost of tin- improvement spread
over a large amount of territory,
thus reducing the- cost to each prop
erty owner to a minimum. The
boundary lines of the big district are
defined in a resolution appearing
elsewhere in this issue. The con
templated paving in the district in
cludes 15 blocks, as follows:
High street, from Main to Dexter;
Dexter street, from High to Side;
Side street from Dexter to South;
South street, from Side to Hill; mil
street, from South to Jackson; .lack
son street, from Hill to Spring;
Spring street, from Jackson to Dan
iel.
The second largest district con
templated, which will also be im
proved under the enlarged district
plan, is North State street, from the
0.-W. R. & N. tracks to the city lim
its on Military hill. The boundaries
of this district are named in Reso
lution No. 323, published In this is
sue of The Herald, The paving In
cludes eight blocks.
The Church street district of six
blocks is defined in Resolution No.
324 as follows: Beginning at a point
where State street intersects the O.-
W. R. & N. tracks; thence southwest
erly along State street to its inter
section with Olson street; thence
northwesterly along Olson street to
its Intersection with Church street;
thence southwesterly along Church
street to its intersection with Blame
street: thence southeasterly along
Blame street to the westerly prop
erty line of State street, and all of
McKinzle street between Church
street and State street, The district
includes six blocks.
Objections of property owners to
all of the three proposed district*
will be heard at the regular meeting
of the council on the evening of June
4, at which time the city engineer
will have on hand an estimate of the
expense of the improvement in each
proposed district, together with his
estimate of the proportionate part of
the aggregate cost to be borne by
each tract or lot benefitted.
