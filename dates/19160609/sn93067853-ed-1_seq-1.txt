Chicago, June 7.?The Republican
national convention held a session of
exactly two hours at the Coliseum
here today, listened for one hour and
20 minutes to a carefully prepared
keynote speech by Senator Warren G.
Harding, the temporary chairman,
perfected its organiation and adjourned
until 11 o'clock tomorrow.
The initial session was brief, eventI

A mile away at the Auditorium theatre
the national Progressive convention
met in tumultuous session. Fired
by Temporary Chairman Raymond
Robins, at the first mention of Theodore
Roosevelt's name the Progressives
broke loose in a demonstrafor
one hour and 33 minutes indulged
in a cheering, flag waiving march
around the hall. The chairman and
the sergeant-at-arms surrendered
helplessly to the tide and let the delegates
have their way.
When Robins finished his speech an
organization was effected, and an adjournment
taken until 2 o'clock tomorrow.
A cold wind-driven rain, that has
fallen/ ceaselessly since yesterday,
placed vehicles at a premium, and
scores were compelled to make their
way on foot to the convention hall.
This dampened any attempt at outdoor
demonstration, except for the women.
Five thousand of them trudged
for two hours through the downpour
to the sound of bands.

j Look to Hughes. ~\
More political leaders are predictingthe
nomination of Jefferson Hughes
j*,*-* tewigh% thaw at any time -since the.
Republican national convention began
to assemble. They declare that unless
the accumulation of overwhelming
circumstantial evidence fails to reflect
the situation in its true light,
the nomination of the justice will
come even sooner than has been predicted.
toie men who take this view
are practical politicians who do not
make estimates unless they are based
on a careful canvass of the delegates.
The situation is illustrated best by
he fact that conferences between
leaders to discuss the availability of
different candidates practically have
ceased, indicating their belief that a
majority of the delegates already have
veached a decision to nominate Justice
Hughes.
Convention observers find it impossible
not to be impressed by the confident
predictions of these leaders, who
say that the Hughes boom now has
grown up to such formidable proportions
that Col. Roosevelt no longer
holds the veto power which until this
time has been conceded to him as part
of the program to bring the Republican
and Progressive parties into
pccord.

nominee was subordinated to harmony,
failed to bring the results desired and
.the trend from the outset was definitely
towards the nomination of Justice
Hughes. Had Col. Roosevelt announced
during this period that he
would not support the justice the leaders
were prepared to turn to any
one of the regular Republican candidates.
The colonel remained silent,
however, and because the managers of
other candidates had fostered the
Hughes boom for the purpose of
eliminating Roosevelt as a possibility
it grew prodigiously and even a combination
of the favorite sons' strength
was powerless to check it The reason
for this was that the candidacy
of no other Republican made any
progress and delegates pledged to
favorite sons found no other presidential
possibility but Justice Hughes
to whom they could turn thei"
strength. Justice Hughes thus naturally
became the choice of practically
all delegates instructed for Others.

ticket will be the same as in ?

FAIR FOREST CHAPTER
ENTERTAINED TUESDAY.
The Fair Forest chapter, D. A. R.,
was delightfully entertained Tuesday
afternoon at the handsome colonial
home of Mrs. C. H. Peake, Mrs. M. A.
Moore and Miss Eliabeth Arthur assisting
hostesses. This being the last
meeting of the year the regent called
for reports from the different officers,
after which Mrs, Fred McLure gave
the chapter much pleasure by singing
Foster's "Good-Bye."
Mrs. M. A. Moore read a most inj
teresting paper on Rebecca Motte and
Miss Robertson gave a brief sketch
of Sarah Hopton. Mrs. Rainey told
of having in her possession a very
old map of South Carolina when the
State was divided into precincts and
the courthouse of Union was situated
at Pinckney. Mrs. Rainey will place
this map in library for the benefit of
any who care to see it. At this conclusion
of the program the guests
were invited into the dining room
where delicious strawberry cream and
cake were served, the regent, Mrs.
L. J. Hames, cutting the cream from
a beautifully appointed table.
conservative representatives of the
Progressive party hope to prevent action
in their convention until Friday.
The convention today having gone
/over until 2 p. m. tomorrow they plan
to occupv the entire afternoon session,
if they can, with a discussion of
a platform and other questions. The
effort to delay making a nomination
is because a few of the leaders still
profess that there is some prospect
of reaching an agreement with the
Republican managers.

PLAN TO ARBIH
MEXI(
Washington Considering Propos:
Differences?May Serve as
Provides Expressly
- Disputes By
Washington, June 7.?A proposal to
Gen. Carranza that the United States
and the Mexican de facto government
submit the whole subject of their relations
to an international commission
is being seriously considered by the
administration.
Such a proposal, it is said, will
serve as a reply to the Mexican note
demanding withdrawal of the American
troops, and may contemplate adjustment
of many unsettled differences
that for years have caused accumulating
embarrassment in the relations
of the two countries. Settlement
by a commission is provided for
expressly by the treaty of 1848.
Pesident Wilson and Gen. Carranza
would appoint an equal number of
commissioners under the plan, and the

outside the territory of both
countries. There was no indication tonight
that the President, with whom
rests the final decision on the proposal,
had yet reached a decision.
Just what scope would be given the
commissioners had not been worked
out. Many officials believe such a discussion
would do much to solve the
difficulties. In addition to military
questions there are far-reaching ecoNATIONAL
FLAG
June 14 has been designated as flag
day throughout the nation by Presdent
Wilson in order that the American
people may "express our thoughtful
love of America." The following
letter, from the National Security
league, has reached the secretary of
the state security league:
"President Wilson has issued a proclamation
sitting aside June 14th ps

the public schools on that day.
"The National Security league suggests
that if there are any children of
foreign-born parents in your schools
that a special invitation be sent the
narents and other relatives of the
children, asking them to attend.
"We believo this will go a long way
toward uniting all peoples in America
and In getting the full cooperative interest
and support of parents in our
American educational work."
The following is President Wilson's
proclamation:
"Many circumstances have recently
conspired to turn our thoughts to a
critical examination of the conditions
of our national life, of the influences
which have seemed to threaten to
divide us in interest and sympathy, of
forces within and forces without that

nomic considerations.
Boundary Questions.
Coming down from by-gone years
are unsettled questions as to certain
portions of the international boundary.
Out of the Vera Cruz incident arose
new problems, which must be cleared
up sooner or later, including disposition
of the customs revenues collected
by Gen. Funston, amounting to
more than $1,000,000, and now deposited
in this country. There are also
claims for property damage at Vera
Cruz, long pigeon-holed in the navy
department.
Most far-reachinp of all, however, is
me question of indemnification for
American lives lost and American
property destroyed or damaged during
the years of revolution in Mexico. No
attempt ever has been made to set
an estimate upon the amount involved
in these claims; but all are recorded
at the State department awaiting
restoration of order and peace in
Mexico for a day of settlement.
While the commission suggestion
may not propose to go into a broad
discussion of all these matters, it
seems likely that each will have its
bearing upon the deliberations.

Mr. W. W. I lames of Jonesville has
been appointed by Governor Manning
to the position of game warden for
Union county, and has begun the duties
of the office. Many do not know
the present law on the subject, and
may get into trouble if they neglect
to inform themselves.
At the 191(5 session of the legislature
this county was included under
the provisions of the Resident Hunters
License Law. This law requires
all hunters to procure a license in
order to hunt. The cost of resident
hunting licenses is $1.00 for the county
license, which entitles the holder
to hunt in accordance with the laws
anywhere within the county, but is not
good for hunting outside of this county.
State licenses cost $51.00 and are
good for hunting in this county or
any other county in South Carolina.
The law further provides {hat landlords,
tenants and their children are
not required to have a license while
hunting upon their own freeholds or
leaseholds and landlords may give
written permission to a resident of his
county to hunt upon his land, in which
event the written permission is a
substitute for the county license; the
said written permission must be carried
by the hunter and exhibited to
the game warden or any officer upon
demand. This written permission cannot
be given to anyone residing outside
of this county. The holder of a
license is not required to have any
written permit from the land owner
and is at liberty to hunt upon any
land where there is no objection from
the land owner. The license, however,
does not give the holder the
right to trespass in* any manner.
These licenses can be obtained from
any magistrate or clerk of court or
