LOCAL TELEPHONE
CHANGES OWNERSHIP
ST. HELENS TO BE
ON RAILROAD MAP
TRANSFER MADE JUNE 1
ProMrty und Franchise Taken Over
by Pacific Ktutes.
On June 1 a deal was consum
mated whereby Dr. J. L. Zlpperer
sold to the Pacific States Telephone
& Telegraph Company the franchise
and exchange of the St. Helens Tele
phono Company. In addition to all
the city lines, the many phones on
the Yankton, Bachelor Flat. Warren
und Scappoose lines are Included.
Tho consideration is not definitely
known but It is understood that a
good price was paid. The Pacific
States people have already taken over
the business here and Leo J. Conlin
has been appointed manager. There
are many who regret that the Zip
perers have given up the exchange,
for no reasonable person in St. Hel
ens could possibly have any Just com
plaint as to the service they gave.
We hope the Pacific people will do
as well, though for a starter there Is
no comparison.
Leo J. Conlin, the newly appointed
manager of the telcphono company
In St. Helens, was married In Port
land on' Monday to Miss Bessie
Meischner. They are spending their
honeymoon In Seattle and will re
turn to St. Helens about June 15.

TICKETS TO ST. HELENS
Station Xume to )le Chunged From
Houlton to St. Helens.
An official bulletin issued by A.
Davidson, general superintendent
of the S. P. & S. R. R., conveys the
pleasing information that on Satur
day, June 17, the station now known ,
as Houlton will be changed to St.
Helens, thus placing St. Helens on
the railroad map. After tho date
mentioned, when you go to the S.
P. & S. tciket office at Portland ydu
can call for a railroad ticket to St.
Helens and call just as loud as you
wish. After the 17th, no more will
you hear the melodious voice of the
brakeman calling, "Houlton, change
for St. Helens;" no more will wires
be sent by eastern people asking how
to get to St. Helens; no more will
they be told that by taking a boat
from Portland, St. Helens can be
reached In several hours, a distance
of 30 miles; no moro will the rail
road people print on their folders,
To St. Helens 3 miles, fare 25 cents,
change at Houlton." St. Helens Is
now on the railroad map. It Is a
great advantage to tho ' city, and,
moreover. It will do Houlton no
harm. The Interest of these two
communities aro identical and a good
pull all together will accomplish
much. Much credit for this change
must bo' given to the Commercial
Club, who have been persistent in
their efforts to have ?he name
changed, and here's hoping It will
work out for tho good of all con
cerned.
DIRECTORS OF LUM
BER COMPANY MEET

C. R. Young of Portland, succeeded

cers were elected:
President Chas. R. McCormick, of
San Francisco.
Vice President R. C. Merryman,

A NIGHT IN
FAIRY LAND
A Spectacular and Beautiful Kilter
Probably the largest audience ever
gathered In the City Hall was there
Tuesday night to witness the chil
dren's spectacular musical play "A
Night In Fairyland." All available
seats were occupied and the S. R. O.
Blgn was hung out. The concensus
of opinion is that the play was the
most beautifully staged entertain
ment ever given In St. Helens and
requests are being made for Us repe
tition.
Under the skillful hands of Mrs.
Edwin Ross, the entire hall was
transformed Into a woodland sceno
with evergreens and festoons of wis
teria; A spot light machine added
much to the beauty of tho stage by
throwing different colored lights
upon tho Btago and cast. Miss Har
reit Ross, as Dorothy, the little girl
lost In tho woods, gave both her sing
ing and speaking parts in a sweet,
distinct voice, nnd acted with much
composure although It was her Initial
appearance before the footlights. Miss
Edrle LeBare, as Queen of the Fair
ies, was a real queenly looking queen.
She spoke in a distinct voice and sang
well. Marlon Morton, as "Queen
Rose," was sweet uud unassuming
and lead the difficult drill perfectly.
