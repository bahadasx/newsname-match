CALDWELL SCHOOL SAVINGS
BANK MAKES GREAT RECORD
Children Lay Aside $202.70 First
Month of Operation of Plan.
The public sohool savings bank, to
which reference has been made lir
these columns on past occasions, has
made a most gratifying record. The
first month the school bank was in
operation, four grades saved $202.70.
The record made in this city is at
tracting wide attention. The Recla
mation Record for June has the fol
lowing comment:
Thrift Movement Growing. »
The thrift movement is being fol
lowed on many of the projects by the
introduction of a school savings bank
system. The town of Caldwell reports
the introduction of a plan similar to
the Williston project system ■describ
ed in the May Rjfcord. Ten cents is
all that is necessary to open an ac
count, and when this amount is
brought to the teacher by the pupil he
' is given a card which, when presented
at the bank, will secure for him a "Sys
tem bank." When $1 has been saved
the pupil deposits the money at the
bank itself, so that he learns the first
step in banking money, and the
amount of deposit is recorded by the
teacher.
For the one month that the Caldwell
system had been in operation, and with
only four grades emrolled, there was
a saving of $202,70. Other grades will
be enrolled when sufficient equipment
is secured. The banks, enrollment
cards, etc., are furnished by the bank
and it is hoped that when the fall
term opens the other two banks will
be cooperating. Each week the teach
ers are asked to conduct a lesson in
thrift which, of course, is intended to
instill into the boys and girls the ides
that thrift consists not only in intelli
gent saving, but intelligent spending
as well. It is recognized that a good
education consists largely of correct
habits of thought and action, and the
purpose of the plan is to teach, not
the hoarding of money, but habits of
wise saving and wise spending.
SHERIFF FROMAN AND RETI
NUE MAKE DRIVE ON HOTEL
Canyon's Jurisdiction Also Extended
Into Owyhee County by Sheriff,
Sheriff Froman, accompanied by his
entire retinue, and supported on the
left by Chief Baker, made a search of
the Caldwell rooming house Tuesday
evening. The purpose of the visit
to the rooming house was to find the
identification check for a trunk which
at that moment rested in the baggage
room at the Oregon Short Line depot
The check was not found. However,
that there might be no waste of ef
fort, Mr. Froman notified the landlady
at the rooming house that the place
would have to close.
The rooming house closed Tuesday
but we understand will foe opened at
once by C. W. Cooper, owner of the
building. The landlady, Mrs. Has
san, and the chambermaids, have de
parted.
Booze Seized at the Depot.
Baggage Agent Everley Friday last
noticed that a trunkful of clothing was
leaking. He immediately notified
Sheriff Geo. W. Froman, who at once
realized the fact that the leak was a
valuable clew. He stationed members
of the force at convenient points
around the depot to await the coming
of the owner of the trunk. Strange
as it may seem, when the owner sajv
the force of deputies watching the
trunk, he went about his business
without claiming the property. Ac
cording to Rule No 18 of the Rising
Sun Correspondence School of Detec
ating, complete in 20 lessons, the own
er should have walked right up. claim
ed the trunk and lugged it off.
Sortie Into Owyhee County,
Smarting under the defeat in th
trunk case, and for the purpose of re
trieving his reputation as a sleuth
Sherman Froman made a sortie into
Owyhee county Tuesday. He receiv
ed a telephone message from Jordan
Valley that a citizen of Caldwell was
on his way to Caldwell with a jug of
liquor, having purchased the same at
McDermitt, and displayed his purchase
at Jordan Valley. Mr. Froman set
forth at once. After scouring the
hills of Owyhee county for several
hours Mr. Froman located his quarry
and made the arrest, ad locum. 'Dh
victim was brought to Caldwell by the
Sheriff and one of his deputies.
Why the victim was not taken to
Silver City we are unable to learn. It
seems that the jurisdiction of Sheriff
Froman expands and contractr ad lib
ituni. It is a very convenient juris
diction.
BAKER TO BE CANDIDATE
FOR COUNTY SHERIFF
Popular Chief of Police Decides to
Make Fight for Nomination.
John A. Baker, chief of police of
Caldwell and a well known Republi
can, has decided to become a candidate
for the Republican nomination for
county sheriff. Mr. Baker will prob
ably make formal announcement of his
candidacy at an early date.
Mr. Baker has had years of exper
ience in a line of work that well quail
fies him for the office to which he as
pires. He is a thorough going Re
publican and a very popular man. Mr.
Baker is well known throughout the
county
The Tribune knows of no one at this
time who is better qualified or more
deserving of earnest considération by
the Republicans of Canyon county.
Mrs. Fred Floed of Boise was in
the city yesterday in the interests of
The New Freedom, the oracle of the
Democratic party in the State of Ida
ho. The Tribune acknowledges a very
pleasant call from Mrs. Floed.

ARMY TESTS AND PASSED
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Examining Officers Remark Splendid
Condition of Men—New Militia Law
Will Bring Thousands of Dollars to
City—Great Interest is Now Being
Taken in National Guard.
Monday evening the members of
Co. G., N. G. I., passed the U. S. Army
standard medical examination with fly
ing colors, not a single man being re
jeated.
The examination, conducted by Ma
jor Tukey, Major Jeffries and Sergt.
Bruce, was rigid in every particular,
and the result was extremely gratify
ing. Major Tukey was delighted with
the showing made by the men and de
clared Caldwell stood at the head of
all of the companies he had examined,
in regard to physical development and
fitness.
"I certainly congratulate you," he
said in speaking to Captain Banks af
ter the examinations were concluded,
in having such a splendid body of
men. Some of them looked to me to
little under weight before they
stripped and got on the scales, but
they are fine specimens of the physical
man. Every one of the men passed
with a good margin. That this means
something may be gathered from the
fact that in the last two examinations
made, 11 out of 25 were rejected in
one town and seven were turned down
in the other. This is the first com
piny examined that passed every man."
The examination was called for the
purpose of (acquiring an accurate rec
ord of each of the men for the war de
partment of the United States, in ac
cordance with the requirements of the
bill recently passed by Congress and
which was signed by the President
last Saturday. Under the provisions
of this bill the National Guard was
federalized" and is now under abso
lute control of the President. The
men will receive 25% of the pay of the
regulars, except when under arms,
when they will get the regular pay.
With the splendid opportunities for
advancement offered in the National
Guard and the army, it is expected
that the ranks of the Guard will soon
be recruited to maximum strength.
The pay of the men in the National
Guard will be equivalent to $1.00 for
each drill night—and a vacation of 15
days each year with all expenses paid
—besides pay of from $1.50 a day up.
The pay of the officers will range from
S200.00 for the second lieutenant to
!>500 Der annum for the captain of each
company.
The new range north of the city is
rapidly being put into first-class con
dition and some good scores are being
shot each week.
COUNTY COMMITTEE WILL
ELECT DELEGATES TUESDAY
State Platform Convention Will Meet
at Boise June 27th.
The law provides that the county
central committee of each political
party shall meet at the county seat on
the second Tuesday of June for the
purpose of electing delegates to
state platform convention of the party
to be held at the state capital on the
fout h Tuesday of June.
Pursuant to the provisions of law
the Republican County^ Central com
mittee will meet in Caldwell Tues
day. Chairman Baldridge is in the
east but we understand that Secretary
Kerrick has issued the call for the
meeting of the committee. Canyon
county is entitled to 18 members of
the platform convention—three times
tlie number of members of the state
legislature.
A Word of Commendation.
Editor Tribune—I want to commend
the stand which The Tribune is taking
in regard to the price of water rights
under the Boise-Payette project. Ida
ho has been the experimental station
for reclamation work and the mistakes
made have been numerous and costly.
It is not just to pass the burdens of
these mistakes on to the shoulders of
the home-builders, but the Govern
ment ifself should assume the respon
sibility. Otherwise, bankruptcy and
ruin will be the portion of the settler.
What the Government is more vitally
interested in than in the mere dollars
and cents involved is that the reclaim
ed lands should become the abiding
place of a contested and happy people
and this is absolutely impossible under
the financial burden proposed to be
placed upon them. The entire press
of the State should join you in this
campaign for justice.

VAN DEUSEN 'REPORTS
ARE SPRINGING OP
IN AIL PARTS
JUDGE DUNLAP UNCOVERS ER
ROR AND HENRY GRIFFITHS
IMMEDIATELY LETS CAT
OUT OF THE BAG.
City Clerk of Caldwell Insists Error
Was Made—County Administration
is Furious and Trying to Explain—
Very Interesting Situation as Result
of Remarks Made by Attorney.
How many Van Deusen reports are
there? According to H. A. Griffiths,
prosecuting attorney, there are at least
two. There is the report public and
the report private. The report private
contains things not show.n by the re
port public. The report extraordinary
and the report political and finally the
report inferential will probably come
to light sooner or later.
The report private came to public
notice when Attorney Griffiths stated
that the errors discovered by Judge
S. Ben Dunlap were noted in a private
report made by Van Deusen.
Judge S. Ben Dunlap, who under
stands accountng about as well as
some experts who are at large, dis
covered the overpayment of $625.67
in the settlement between the county
and the city. Mr. Dunlap in conformi
ty with his duty in the presmises call
ed attention to the facts in the case.
The county administration were im
mediately up-in-arms with Judge Dun
lap, Mr. Griffiths stating to Mr. Dun
lap, "you are getting us county of
ficers in bad. The error appears
Van Deusen's private report."
Statement by Judge Dunlap.
Judge Dunlap gave out the follow
ing statement Wednesday:
"I do not claim to have discovered
the overpayment from the general
road fund to the city of Caldwell.
Subsequent to some slight criticism
which had been made of the city gov
ernment, alleging lack of diligence in
aollecting from the county, I went to
the county offices and secured data
for investigation and discovered the
excess payment. Later, when in the
office of the county auditor, I was
advised by Deputy County Auditor
Snell that the city had been paid an
amount in excess of what was due it
from the general road fund, and
said _ to him that I realized this, as
my investigation confirmed his state
ment to this effect.
"As to who first had insight into
this discrepancy is of small import
ance. Mr. Snell may have discovered
this discrepancy before I did, or our
discovery may have been made simul
taneously. I do not know about that
The matter is of such small conse
quence I refuse to further discuss it.
The county officials admit that the
supposed error still stands. They ex
plain that the overpayment was due
to inclusion of bridge funds as well as
road funds in the settlement. In
recent case the supreme court has rul
ed that both arc to be considered
"road" funds. This decision, in effect
clears former county officials who
niade the payments. Instead of hav
ing funds coming to it to cover this
item, as have other towns of the coun
ty, Caldwell has already received about
the amount due it under the new inter
pretation of the statute. Some check
ing to secure an exact settlement be
tween the city and county remains to
be done.
T. A. WALTERS VISITS
STATE UNIVERSITY
Makes First Inspection of University
Is Prominent Attorney
(Moscow Star-Mirror)
It is a pleasure for me to be in
Moscow again and to be here especial
ly during commencement week at the
University of Idaho," declared T. A.
Walters of Caldwell, a member of the
state board of education, who arrived
in the city last night to attend a meet
in" of the board. "I had the pleasure
of visiting here during the last cam
paign but my time was necessarily
limited. During my present stay I
hope to make a complete inspection
of the university plant and to famil
iarize myself with every detail. It is
my first visit to the university since
becoming a member of the board and
I hope to now become better acquaint
ed with its aims and needs."
Mr. Walters is one of the best
known attorneys in Idaho and during
the last campaign was a candidate on
the democratic ticket for attorney
general. Mr. Walters is a keen ob
server and is eminently qualified to
act as a member of the state board and
his selection by Governor Alexander
came after very mature consideration
on his part.
Mr. Walters came directly to Mos
cow from Pocatello at which piace he
delivered the commencement address
to the graduating class of the Poca
tello high school. Mr. Walters plans
to visit the Lewiston normal and the
Sandpoint experiment farm before re
turning south.

Regular Monthly Sales Will be Big

Past—Army Inspections Will Be

ing the Auction Sales.
The auction sales at the Union Stock
\ ards this month are the largest in
the history of the yards. There were
more horses on hand than ever before.
The attendance of buyers was the big
gest the association has ever known.
The horses offered for sale were
taken quickly and at good prices.
There was lively bidding at times and
strong competition among the buyers
all of the time.
The sale commenced Tuesday with
over 1900 head of horses on hand.
Tuesday 250 head of horses were sold
through the ring. Wednesday the
horses went much faster but the even
ing of the second day of the sale a
great many horses remained an hand.
Yesterday the sale closed with practi
cally all horses sold at auction or at
private sale.
The officers of the association are
well pleased with the success of the
June sales. They look forward to still
bigger sales in July and to a steady
increase in the size of the sales and
in the attendance henceforth.
$11,000 Per Day Paid Out.
The four days rior to the June sales,
the Caldwell Horse & Mule Co. paid
out cxver $11,000 per day for horses,
according to a statement made by Mr.
F. G. Hoffman, secretary and cashier
of the company.
The inspections held at Caldwell by
the English, French and Italian gov
ernments during the past 18 months
have in a measure injured the monthly
auction sales. The buyers would not
come because they felt that only the
stuff rejected bv the European coun
tries would be put through the ring.
For some time the company has been
doing away with inspections as far as
possible. Of course contracts entered
into had to be carried out but new
contracts were not made.
