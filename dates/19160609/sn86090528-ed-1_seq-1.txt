OMINOUS
OPENING
OUTLOOK
Pluvius (lets Gsy Early in Game,
Threatening to Take Hand in Golf
Tourney; Battle is Begun
Furiously
As the Rock Island train bearing the
belligerent horde of F.l Reno golfers
hove into viev this morning, deep In
tonations Mke the sounds of exploding
bombs sent a chill through the hearts
of certain timid Chickasha warriors
wlio were gathered at the station to
meet the invading foe.
A rumor gained currency that the
terrifying tones were due to the fact
that Judge Libby, the Achilles of the
El Reno hordes, had already begun a
long-range bombardment with his
"iiusy Hejrtha," the same being one
42-centlmeler pipe which he loads with
Hillside Navy when he gets into action
on the links. Hasty reconnoilering
by the aviation corps, however, soon
reassured the Chickasha clan, the re
port being brought back that the loud
rumbling that rent the skies was
merely the, mill tarings "of J. Pluvius
who, peeved that he had not been in
vited to enter tourney, was kicking up
a disturbance, demanding that he be
admitted as an entry at the last min
ute. In the face of this ominous outlook,
deep gloom pervaded the ranks of
both bands of warriors as the train
pulled in at the station and the, vis
itors were welcomed. With the ele
ments still acting up, emissaries were
immediately sent to treat with Gen. J.
Pluv in an effort to persuade h:'rl to
withdraw from his offensive, but the
monarch of the land of moisture and
storms sent word back that, there was
nothing doing. As themoniing wore
on, with the golf forces maneuvering
on the links, the skies thickened and
by 11 o'clock it Iookc' like J. Pluv was
destined to come out conqueror in the
battle.
Despite the threatening weather, the
large crowd of El Reno players, with
nearly as many ladies, were conveyed
in cars to the Country club and the.
program for the day was started.
With communication crippled at this
hour, it is impossible to state with ac
curacy how the battle is going, lirief
bulletins from the scene or hostilities
early in t he action stated that the fray
was being fought furiously in spots but
with no indications pointing to the
final outcome. Conservative sports in
the early hours of the combat, how
ever, were placing their bets on J.
Pluv.
the people his best services.
Trusting that the citizens of this
district fully realize my position in
this matter, with th'f deepest regret.
m,ist advise them of the withdrawal
0f nl)- candidacy in the coming elec-
-while doing so I want to thank
my friends and supporters for their
loyalty to me ami want to say that 1
expei t to give you my best services
while I remain in office. Once again
1 thank you.

I of the Iti'Diihlican nartv. .lames J. Mc-
Graw, of Ponea City, was elected na
tional committeeman of Oklahoma by
tlie Republican national convention at
5 o'clock Thursday afternoon. His
name was the only ona presented to
the convention by the Oklahoma del
egation. The friend of James Harris,
former national committeeman, who
sought re-election, had given up the
fight before the final show-down
came.
The name of Theodore Roosevelt
was mentioned for the first time in
the Republican convention this morn
ing when Senator Reed Smoot of Utah,
arose and told the convention that the
conference committee, appointed by
the two conventions to consult in re
gard to candidates, bad reported that
the l'rogressive members, of the com
mittee were unanimous for Roosevelt.
At the mention of Roosevelt's name
a demonstration was si.arieu, which
lasted three minutes and w'as stopped
with difficulty.
When the roll call of states for the
nomination of presidential candidates
was begun this morning, Alabama
passed and Governor Whitman, or
New York, presented the name of Jus
tice Hughes, provoking the greatest
demonstration of the convention.

Chicago, 111., June 9. It is expected
that nominations will be made today in

Early this morning the indications
were tht. the conservatives woum ue
unable to further restrain the radical
element among the Moose, who are
bent upon pushing through the nomi
nation of Roosevelt at once, regardless
of whatever action that the Republican
convention may take.
The Hughes boomers among the Re
