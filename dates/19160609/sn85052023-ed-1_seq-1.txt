BANQUETS AT
CRAB ORCHARD
Masons and Eastern Stars and Odd
Fellows Entertain Friends With
Delightful Affairs.
Crab Orchard, June 9.
Two 'of the most enjoyable enter
tainments ever given in Crab Or
chard, were the banquets of the Ma
sons and "Eastern Star" combined,
which was given at the Masonic Hall
on Thursday night of last week, and
the Odd Fellows' banquet on last
Friday night, and both occasions
will long be remembered with pleas
ure. Rev. C. E. Wyatt, pastor of
the Christian church was chosen as
Toastmaster at both banquets.
In a beautiful and appropriate
prayer, Rev. Morgan, of Crab Or
chard opened the meeting. Mr. H.
G. Skiles, secretary of Crab Orchard
Lodge, in a most enthusiastic manner
welcomed the guests, told of the
great work being done by the order
all over the world, and plainly
showed how proud he was to be
long to such an organization.
J. N. Saunders, of Stanford, Dep
uty Grand Master of Grand Lodge,
was next introduced by Rev. Wyatt,
and he entertained the crowd for
several minutes in a most interest
ing talk about the greatness of his
order not forgetting to explain
how a poor brother was initiated,
which was laughable in the extreme.
Mrs. Katherine Watts Clark, Wor
thy Grand Matron of the "Eastern
Star" order, was next introduced in
a beautiful manner, by Toastmaster
Wyatt. She spoke of the pleasure
it was to her to see the rapid stride
the order was making here in Crab
Orchard; was satisfied with their
work, and said it was her first at
tempt to address both the Masonic
and Eastern Star orders upon any
occasion. She was a most interest
ing speaker and is thoroughly in
touch with her great work.
Rev. Wyatt next introduced Dr.
George B. Lyne, Worthy Patron of
the Eastern Star, and Mr. Lyne gave
an interesting story which thorough
ly explained how much charity work
and help the order was rendering to
the world, and still practicing the
scriptural injunction of not letting
the left hand know what the right
hand doeth, and right here let us
say if any man on earth lives this
life, it is our own townsman, Mr. G.
B. Lyne, who has never yet xefused
to answer liberally to every call of
need, and never speaks of what he
has done.
Dr. M. M. Phillips, Master of
Crab Orchard Lodge, was the next
speaker introduced and spoke in stir
ring terms of the grandness and
benevolence of his order; of the
work accomplished, and of the great
possibilities awaiting them. He
spoke with an ease and grace of
manner and like all the rest, was
proud to belong to such an order.
The next speaker to be intro
duced by Rev. Wyatt was Mr. David
Jackson, of Louisville, Past Grand
Master, and now Grand Secretary of
Kentucky and in his happiest mood,
his face beaming as though he was
eager to talk, he did some talking.
He showed in every tone and ges
ture how proud he was to belong to
the great Masonic order; said no
people on earth were doing so much
good for the world. Explained the
great work being done for the wid
ows and orphans in Kentucky; how
the little ones were being taught
every useful thing. How doctors,
dentists and nurses worked without
any pay to help this institution; of
its sanitary condition of the Home
for men at Shelbyville, with 44 in
mates enjoying all the privileges of
home, and many times during his
most interesting talk he would stop,,
be a Mason." He also told of the
.j aav iiiji iu -t.j jv....-....w.fc .
four years at High School to be
given the orphans after 'they leave
the Home. Then followed the good
part of the program tables reach
ing the full length of the Masonic
Halls were laden with everything to
tempt the palate. Cold boiled ham
in generous slices, light breead, pic
kles, dressed eggs, salmon salad,
fruit salad, cheese and olives, then
plates heaped with delicious ice
cream, and fresh strawberries, cof
fee and iced tea, delicious cakes.
Prof. Hatfield offered the closing
prayer. Music was splendidly ren
dered by the Crab Orchard orchestra.
On Friday night the Annual Ban
quet of the Order of Odd Fellows
was held in the same hall, and as
many of the Masons are also mem
bers of the I. O. O. F., the exercises
were similar. Rev. Wyatt as Toast
master, certainly deserved especial
mention, so well he performed his
part At one time he had the crowd
convulsed with laughter at his -witty
repartees, the next moment almost
in tears at his serious pictures. Any7
way, he was a fine toastmaster at
both banuqets. He is from Carrol
ion, Ky., and pastor of the Christian
church here, where he is doing a
great work.
Prayer by Rev. Wyatt opened the
exercises of the evening. Rev. Wy
att introduced Mr. Skiles as first
speaker, and in his very best style
he welcomed the crowd and then
plunged at once into his subject of
telling how great was his order. He
said be. had belonged to the Odd
Fellows 'since he was twenty-one
years of age, and had never had oc
casion to regret his step; spoke of
the great work they were doing, and
of their Widow's and Orphan's Home
at Lexington, and explained what it
meant to be an Odd Fellow.
The second speaker was Mr. W.
,H. McDonald, of Barbourville, who
paid a beautiful tribute to Kentuc-
ky, her people, her scenery, her
grand possibilities, and that in this,
as in every state of our grand old,
union, you are able to find a brother
wherever you go. He spoke of the
youthfulness of the order of Odd
Fellows only a little over a hun
dred years, and he exclaimed, "Give
us another hundred years, and what
cannot we accomplish?" He said he
belonged to 54
SOcietieS, Saying
nothing about his being a Methodist
and a member of the Republican!01' L" Urt "c " "J?1" i """"
party. His talk was both enjoyed ed meetings m seventy-five churches
and appreciated and his witticisms
were line
The next speaker introduced by;

boosted Mr. George B. Lyne of Crab ty grand-father, father, and son,

Grand Lodge. Both stated how well
worthy Mr. Lyne was for the posi
tion. Mr. George B. Lyne was the
next speaker to take the stand, and
although he had a great deal he in
tended to say, he was so embarrass
ed and surprised at being boosted
for Grand Warden that he said very
little. He praised his order, spoke at
large of their grand work, and ot
their prosperous brotherhood.
Rev. Wyatt then introduced Hon.
R. L. Tomlinson, of Lancaster. We
were expecting grand things from
him, and he certainly did not dis
appoint us. A natural orator, the
silvery notes followed in beautiful
cadence as he ascended night after
flight of lofty minded pictures. He
tcld how if he were a painter, he
would paint upon canvas Oddfellow
ship; he would show the open grave
in which the father of a family lay;
on one side the widow, on the other
the orphan; then the great light of
Odd Fellowship surrounding, pro
tecting and caring for them both.
This he said was what it meant to
be an Odd Fellow. Such an order
with such principles could not be
kept down, and today stands without
a peer. He spoke of the grand no
ble women of Kentucky, not failing
to pay a tribute to his own wife, and
then his eulogy of woman was per
fectly sublime but at the very last
of his beautiful tribute to her, he
made this assertion. He said we
were told in the Bible that God made
man and that after man's creation
God rested. Then a rib was taken
from man and woman was formed;
said there was no record in the Bi
ble that God rested after he created
her, but one fact remained man
had had no rest since she was cre
ated. Dr. Phillips then addressed the
crowd n a few well chosen remarks,
well delivered, and pointed, and was
glad to see such great enthusiasm
shown. ,
The menu was exactly the same
as that at the Masonic banquet, and
about one hundred and forty well
fed people went away feeling that
it was good to have been there.
The same number of people at
tended each banquet as nearly as
could be estimate'd. The two orders
desire to express their thanks to the
ladies who served the feasts, and to
the young ladies who waited on the
tables, and to the orchestra for the
sweet music.

REV. CARPENTER HONORED.
Rev. Homer Carpenter, pastor of
the Shelbyville Christian church,
and who married Miss Tevis Carpen
ter, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. J. G.
Carpenter, of this city, has just been
highly and signally honored by be
ing chosen Chancellor of Transylva
nia University, College of the Bible
and Hamilton College at Lexington,
and has tendered his resignation as
pastor at Shelbyville to take effect
the first of September. Mr. Carpen
ter's election was made several
weeks ago by the combined boards
of the three institutions and a com
mittee was sent to notify him of their
action. He took the matter under
consideration, being at first loath to
give up pastoral work, and it was
not until a second committee visited
him and urged his acceptance of the
position that he gave them a favora
ble answer. The position is a new
one just created by the boards of
the three institutions, which are now
combined under one head, and the
work will be similar to that done by
President Crossfield. The place was j

TRYING TO GET TOGETHER
Rads
and Bull Moose at Chicago
Busy Conferring.
Chicago, June 9 Theodore Roose
velt seized the first opportunity
Thursday to break his silence at
Oyster Bay, whereupon things began
to happen at Chicago, and last night
the Republican and Progressive par
ties took steps on their way to har
mony. A "loaded" committee is already
at work to iron out the differences
between the two parties; and the
only casualties thus far have been
among the Western Progressives of
the Murdock stripe. They realize
that Perkins and his Wall street
friends, with the apparent consent
of Roosevelt are determined to stake
all on putting up one amalgamated
candidate to oppose Woodrow Wil
son, and they see evidences on all
sides that the candidate will be
Charles E. Hughes, whom they
scorn. They may nominate Roose
velt Friday or Saturday, in spite of
conferees of the Republican con
vention, but well-advised men pre
dicted last night that Roosevelt will
decline the nomination.
When the harmony conferees ad
journed early Friday morning they
had decided that the Republican
convention should proceed to ballot
ing as soon as possible in order to
determine as soon as possible in or
der to determine the relative
strength of the candidates. During
the balloting the Conference Com
mittee is to meet again.
The favorite son leaders were
highly pleased with this decision, be
lieving that it gives them a fresh
chance to eliminate Charles E.
Hughes in favor of Philander C.
Knox, of Pennsylvania, as one of
their own number. Hughes leaders
declared they will be able to nomi
nate unless Roosevelt makes a state
ment inimical to their candidate in
the meantime. The Progressive con
ferees agreed to attempt to prevent
a nomination in their convention by
informing the Bull Moose delegates
that their choice is already known.
After the Republican National
Convention had declared elected all
National Committeemen except in
cases where contests had been filed,
friends of J. W. McCulloch, of Ow
ensboro, who was defeated by A. T.
Hert, of Louisville, for this honor,
pressed their fight, saying notice of
contest had been given in this case
and that it would be taken up after
the convention.

COURT WINDING
UP MAY TERM
Civil Suits Occupy Attention During
Closing Hours Three Prison
ers Taken to Penitentiary
The May term of Circuit Court
will probably adjourn late this after
noon after three weeks of work. As
the I. J. goes to press, the attention
of court is directed upon the civil
suit of Will Carter, of Missouri,
against his brothers, J. M. and C. H.
Carter, of this city, for $500 from
each, which he claims should have
come to him as a share of their fa
ther's estate. Quite a number of
witnesses have been heard for each
side and the case is being hard fought
by Attorney J. B. Paxton for the
plaintiff and Attorney K. S. Alcorn
for the defendants.
In the case of the Wheeling Mould
and Foundry Co., against Will Cor
dier for $350, alleged to be due on
the purchase of a gasoline engine, a
jury gave a verdict in favor of Mr.
Cordier, in which they gave him his
contention of a counter-claim against
the plaintiff. He alleged that the en
gine was defective.
The case against D. S. Bromley, of
Louisville, was continued, it beinf:
understood that a compromise agree
able to all parties concerned has
been arranged.
The damage suit of Peter Gose, a
Pulaski county negro against the L
& N. railroad, was thrown out of
