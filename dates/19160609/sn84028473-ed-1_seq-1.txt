with a native Belgian who is now a
traveling salesman In this country
and naturally wo talked of tho pres
ent war in Europe He- Is glad the
German made that destructive drive
through his country In the early part
of the war and thinks his people will
bo all the better for It He thinks
the French people aro best of all na
tions engaged in this war but made a
fatal mistake by becoming an ally
of England and Russia He thinks that
If the French Republic can be allied
with kingdoms and empires in time of
war they can bo better allied with
Germany when peace shall have been
declared this being the only way to
settle the Alsace lLorraine -bono of
contention Both countries have won
derfully changed since the Frajico
Prusslan war France becoming a re
public and Germany becoming an em

Profits and Size of Farms
Let it be remembered that there
is more profit in a large yield on a
smaller area than a smaller yield on
a large area If you have a small
farm it is much better to have It
well drained and fertilized so that
you will get a large yield from few
acres saye Abe T Hazelrlgg Vigo
County Indiana who believes it is
possible for every farmer to grow 80
to 100 bushels of corn per acre Re
member that the productiveness of
the land must be maintained and tho
croups furnished with plantfood so
that they can produce large yields
profitably Every farmer should
study bis eoils and his crops and
adapt his methods to them
