Citizens of Everett Protest
Against Action of Club
Hundreds Gather Sunday After
noon at the City Park
to Protest
DESPITE BAD WEATHER
LARGE CROWD TURNS OUT
People of Everett Protest Against
Resolutions of Commercial
Club
Hundreds of the citizens of Everett
gathered at the-City Park last Sunday
afternoon to protest against the action
of the Commercial Club, Everett's
supposed civic body. In regard to their
fight against unionism.
In spite of Ihe weather the people
gathered early. At noon the leaders
concluded to hold the meeting in the
Labor Temple on account of the rain,
but as tbe hour of meeting came neat
it was plain to be seen that no hall
In Everett would hold the crowd as
sembled. By 2:.'50 the skies cleared
and every one went to tbe park.
The meeting, was presided over by
M. T. Alllman, formerly secretary of
the Trades Council, and prominent
unionist. For over two hours the
audience heard the cause of unionism
expounded probably as it never was
before in Everett Likewise were the
fallacies of the so-called open shop
laid bare.
President J. G. Brown, president of
the International Shingle Weavers,
was probably the principal speaker of
tbe afternoon. Citizens of Everett
heard for the first time in public
meeting (Commercial Club members
please take notice) the true side of
the weavers' strike. They heard what
the mill men promised a year ago and
also lkeard whit the weavers got in
fulfillment of that promise. Brother
Brown was greeted with tremendous
applause.
E. C. Dailey, R. J. Faussett and G.
W. Louttit, aUout the best friends that
organized labor has outside of the
ranks, also addressed the audience
and expressed their views of the Com
mercial Club, Commercial Club reso
lutions, unionism, open shop, etc.
During the meeting the following
resolutions were read and adopted
iinaiiimot..dy. Since the printing of
the resolutions in the daily papers
several of the merchants of Everett
have severed their connections with
„the Commercial Club. Spend no union
money with an advocate of the open
-hop, the worst enemy union labor has.
The Resolutions
"Whereas, Some days ago the board
of directors of tbe Everett Commercial
Club made an alleged investigation of
the strike of tbe shingle weavers of
this city. Without inviting a shingle
<weaver, without seeking a particle of
information from the Shingle Weavers'
Union, and without the authority of
tbe membership of the club itself, the
one-sided conclusions of the directors
were given to the press with the clear
Intention of creating prejudice in the
minds of the public against the strik
ing shingle weavers. Later, when the
matter was to lie considered by the
entire members of the club, a request
was made that the shingle weavers be
given an opportunity to present their
side of the case. This request was
promptly refused, and without hearing
the shingle weavers' side of the cbbc
at all. the report was adopted; and,
"Whereas, This report is biased,
prejudiced, one-sided, and untrue; It
,lcals with the question of the open
Shop, which is no part of the shingle
savers' demand, it was inspired by
the mill owners and passed by those
whose interests are with the em
ployers.
"Therefore, Be it resolved, That
this mass meeting of Everett citizens
hereby voices its resentment at the
shingle weavers being denied a hear
ing before being convicted by the
Kverett Commercial Club, and hereby
pledges itself, Individually and col
lectiwb. to refrain hereafter from
patronizing in any way any member
of the Everett Commercial Club; and,
further,
"Resolved, That we call upon all
"If a man betray you once, shame on him: if he betray you twice, shame on you."
business and professional men, who
share our injured feelings at the un
fair action taken by the Everett Com
mercial Club, to immediately with
draw from that institution, and at the
same time notify organized labor in
writing of their actions to the end
that our friends may not be uncon
sciously Injured by our actions at this
lime."
New York Pedagogues Follow Chicago
Example
Public school teachers in New York
City are discussing organization and
affiliation with the American Federa
tion of Labor. For some years the
Chicago teachers have been organized,
and while at times its affairs have
been in a rather tempestuous condi
tion, great results bave been accom
plished. In New York City sentiment
for unionization has increased be
cause of threatened reduction of sal
aries and uncertainty of positions
following the efforts of local , poli
ticians to control the public schools
by securing the passage of a "home
rule" law by the state legislature. Of
course, the newspapers are opposing
the movement, but admit that the
teachers are displaying "the trade
union temper." If the teachers but
remain in this frame of mind they will
shortly realize that "the trade union
temper" will gain for them more free
dom from political domination than
will ridicule by the press.
SOME GOOD ACCOMPLISHED
Commission Appointed by Wilson
Gets Results
If the strike against the Colorado
Fuel and Iron Company, a Rockefeller
corporation, did nothing else, it
aroused the people of that state to a
keener sense in the welfare of the
workingman. The commission ap
pointed by President Wilson to in
vestigate conditions, headed by Seth
Low, made a report last month, and
in this report it is pointed out that
beneficial laws, such as the creation
of an industrial commission, work
man's compensation and mutual in
surance companies are steps taken in
the right direction. The Rockefeller
industrial plan, however, receives
slight consideration, the report de
claring that the miners have not en
deavored to test the good faith of the
employers in allowing them the privi
lege of joining a union. The men re
fused the commission's request to
announce that they had affiliated with
a union, declaring they were afraid
they would lose their positions by so
doing.
GOVERNMENT CLERKS UNITE
Approximately 5,000 government
clerks at Washington, D. C, have
formed a union and taken affiliation
with the American Federation of La
bor as a sequel to the recent unsuc
cessful effort in congress to require
I hem to work eight hours a day. The
Federal Employes' Union is the name
of the organization, and it pledges
itself not to engage in or support any
strike against the government. TTs
aims are to be sought through legis
lation. All departments of the ex
ecutive branch of the government are
represented in the membership. There
are approximately 40,000 government
clerks in the capital.
ORGANIZE STATE
FEDERATION
A State Federation of Labor has
recently been organized in Idaho by
C. O. Young, district organizer for
the A. F. of Ui who is well known
in Everett and vicinity. In Pocatello
teamsters and retail clerks are 100
per cent organized, and new wage
' scales have been negotiated with sev
eral unions affiliated with the Build
ing Trades, plasterers getting a raise
to $6 per day, electrical workers $4.75
and common laborers received an ad
vance to $3 per day.
A now paper mill now being erected
In Richmond, Pal., will employ all
union men.

Longshoremen
are Confident
Local Union Reports Conditions
Favorable to the
Workers
Of the 12,000 longshoremen of the
Pacific Coast who went out on strike
last week nearly one-half are back at
work with their demands gratified.
Not a member of the local union has
fell by the wayside, and but few on
the entire coast. District officers
stated Wednesday that everything
points to a successful outcome of the
strike and the end will no doubt come
in the near future. There has been no
violence as yet, and so far the em
ployers have hired no strike-breakers.
Several lumber boats In Everett and
vicinity have laid up, apparently wait
ing for the end of the strike. The
steamer Queen in Everett Monday un
loaded only its perishable freight and
sailed back to Frisco with its hold
nearly full of Puget Sound consign
ments, and about all other boats are
in the same predicament.
Passenger boats are either not car
rying freight or, if they were caught
with it in their hold, have not un
loaded it, and the freighters are nearly
all tied up at the docks from San
Diego to Alaska.
Columns have been printed in the
daily press of the "unreasonable" de
mands of the longshoremen—prob
ably written before the aristocratic
reporters knew what the fellows
wanted. For the above reason the

general cargo shall be 55 cents per

1 OF ORGANIZED LABOR.
Purse Seiners
Expel Member
Capt. Chas. Knudsen Fired Out
Because He Dared to
State the Facts
1 ! As the result of a letter written to
the Joint Legislative Committee and
11 published In the labor press showing
• that Initiative Measure No. 22, instead
' of harming the small fisherman would
in fact be of great benefit to him,
('apt. Charles Kuudsen was on Satur
day last expelled from the Puget
Sound Purse Seiners' Protective As
sociation after a stormy session.
The association was organized six
years ago to fight the trap owners,
who bad secured an Injunction pre
venting the fishermen from drifting
near the traps, but the fish trust has
been so active that control of the or
' ganizatlon has passed from the bona
fide fishermen into the hands of rep
resentatives of the trap owners, and
any one opposing tbe policy of the
fish trap trust is now thrown out
bodily.
On Monday of this week Capt. Knud
! sen issued the following statement to
the labor and progressive press:
Capt. Knudsen's Statement
"When a fisherman has the nerve
to stand up and defend the principle
that the organization (the Puget
Sound Purse Seiners' Association!
i stands for, or attempts to expose the
trap corporations, he runs up against
an element that is well trained by its
masters and which has a great in
fluence over many of the fishermen
for many reasons.
"The principle of the organization
when it was started in 1910 was to
protect itself against the injustice of
the trap corporations when at that
time they had the fishermen arrested
and served injunctions against them
whenever the tide drifted their boats
and seines up against their traps;
which cannot be helped, for when a
fisherman has his seine in the water
he is helpless and has to go wherever
the tide takes him, and the result is
that he often drifts on the traps.
For drifting up against the traps
and tearing their seines all to pieces
the trap owners had the fishermen ar
rested, which cost them $300 to $400
to get out of the mess, and now some
of ihese same fishermen are so
friendly to the corporations that when
any one stands up and favors the
abolishment of the trap he is expelled
from that organization, with a good
prospect of being boycotted. ,
Leading Members Represent Traps
"It is true that the members of the
leading element in the organization
are either trap owners themselves or :
in the employ of the corporations as
fish buyers, and draw a big salary
in order to keep tbe fishermen in line ,
by telling them how much money the/
poor fellows lose. For Instance, in
the spring of 1913 they were very
busy telling the fishermen that they
could only pay 15 cents apiece for the
Soekeye salmon, because the price on
the canned goods was down to $5 a
case. Hut behold what happened! '
When they had our fish in the cans (
they boosted the price up to $6.40 a 1
case, and kept on raising the price by '
holding them over from one year to '
another, and then had the gall to tell '
the fishermen they could not find a
market for the fish.
"Look up the report of 1913 and
1914 and see what millions they made,
what mansions they built, what im- '
provements were made in their can- '
nerles -on their losses. While many '
a fisherman Is In debt up to his neck (
to them for his fishing rig. all they 1
got to do Is to take the rigs from the !
fishermen, but they are smart enough ;
not to do that alone, for they want 1
the fishermen to think they still have '
an interest in their boats, so they will '
take beltter care of them, because the I
corporations cannot run the boats, and I
to put strangers in charge of them 1
would mean the neglect of the fishlnc I
gear, and that Is very expensive." '
Fishermen Must Think I
If the average fisherman could only :
figure out things half as well as the I
other fellow he would be well off and I
would not be so easily influenced, but I
this Is what Charles Knudsen got for I
his trouble in trying to enlighten the,
fishermen and expose the corporations, i

polled him from the Purse Seiners'
Protective Association, after being a
member in good standing since it was
organized, paying his dues a year
ahead, and has always worked for the
interest of the small fisherman, which
is borne out by his record, especially
the year he got the city to build a
float at Madison street so the fisher
men could sell their fish to the public
instead of giving them to the fish
trust for next to nothing. Also is
his record borne out when last sum
mer at Richardson he got up a large
meeting to protest against the un
written law in regard to the length
of the lead, with the result that no
arrest was made last season, but
which was threatened. The president
and secretary of the organization, who
are responsible for the expelling of
Knudsen, would not come to the meet
ing, claiming it was no fishermen's
meeting, yet it was the biggest meet
ing of real fishermen that ever as
sembled in one place on Puget Sound,
but no trap corporation was repre
sented at that meeting, which un
doubtedly accounts for their absence
The bone of contention in the poorly
attended meetings has been the Fish
Bill. Knudsen claims it will benefit
the small fishermen to get the traps
abolished, so that they would get a
more decent price for their fish and
not have to throw so many away, de
stroying them while people are
starving.

At Red Hot Meeting Last Wednes
day Night Adopts Infamous
Resolution
THINK UNIONISM 0. K. (?)
BUT DEMAND OPEN SHOP
M. T. Alliman and Attorneys
Dailey, Louttit and Faussett
Lead Fight Against It
The Everett Commercial Club, at a
specially called meeting In their club
rooms on Wednesday evening of last
week, adopted the resolutions, drafted
by their own special committee, con
demning organized labor In genera!
and the shingle weavers' union in
particular.
About 250 members were present,
including probably twenty union men
who had held cards in that organiza
tion, and about thirty or forty more
who are in sympathy with the cause
of unionism.
President Baker of the club, a mill
man, called the meeting to order, and
after tbe reading of the resolution by-
Secretary Blain, Robert Moody,
banker, promptly moved that the reso
lution be adopted.
Then the fireworks started!
Judge W. P. Bell, a member of the
committee, explained the attitude of
the board of directors in regard to the
resolution. He said in part: 'I be
lieve that every member of the board
favors unionism • » • but this
resolution is directed againßt the
abuses of unionism."
George W Louttit, attorney, was the
next to gain the floor and attacked the
resolution with great vigor He em
phasized the fact of the dangerous
nature of the shingle weavers' occupa
tion and of the extremely unsanitary'
conditions under which the weaver
works Mr. Loutti; was in favor of
hearing the shingle weavers' side of
the controversy as well as the mill
men's.
Attorney E. C. Dailey next spoke
against the resolution. "We want to
be fair," said Dailey. "1 would not
vote upon a matter of this nature upon
the recommendation of any commitee
on earth. No facts have been sub
mitted to the clvb —just the resolu
tions and glittering generalities, with
no figures at all. Let us have the mill
men and the strikers meet in friendly
discussion of their grievances."
Attorney R. J. Faussett, the next
speaker of the evening, attacked the
resolution as only "R. J." can when he
is against a measure. Mr. Faussett
also was greatly in favor of arbitrating
the matter, or at least hearing the
strikers' side of the question. During
the latter part of his talk some of the
gentlemen (?l present tried to drown
his remarks with boisterousness
M T Alliman, former secretary of
the Trades Council, was the next
speaker. He pleaded for at least fair
play w Ith the shingle weavers, but was
interrupted continual) Alliman con
sidered that to adopt the resolution
would be to slap from 4.000 to 6,000
of Everett's union men and women
In the face —"and every one of those
4.000 or 6,000 is a buyer in Everett"
While urging the club to hear the
truth of the shingle weavers' side from
President J. G. Brown. Mr. Alliman
was interrupted by Nell Jamison, mill
man, who said the club couldn't get
the truth from Mr. Brown, and "be
sides be is not a shingle weaver, nor
does he live in Everett," added said
Jamison. Mr. Jamison reiterated the
fact that the mill men were strong for
unionism, but were likewise as strong
for the open shop
Mr. Moody got the floor again in
defense of the mill men's resolution
and contended that the strike was
unjust.
W R. Cunningham spoke briefly in
defense of the resolution ,and stated
that he was In doubt If there were
more than 400 union men and women
In Everett
H W Stuchell, mill man, told how
he thought unionism was all right.
On the question being put before
the club. It was adopted by a vote of
about 4 to 1
No. 6H
