Mlnot. N. D., June 9.—-Members of
the Grand' Council of the U. C. T. for
Minnesota and North Dakota got
down to business today with a large
amount: of important legislation be
ing considered at. the executive ses
sion of the council.
The position of the order in regard
to the Farmers' Nonpartisan Political
league brought about a warm debate,
when a resolution, placing the travel
ing men in opposition to that organ
isation, was introduced. The resolu
tion was finally turned down on the
ground that the commercial travelers
were not a political organisation and
that it would, therefore, be improper
for any action to be tatteil in regard
to a purely political matter.
Sentiment among the delegates,
however, was practically unanimous
in condemnation of the league fchd Its
methods.
The most important resolution
passed -by the" council at the session
this morning was one urging the ptiUfc:
Ing of matrons on all passenger trains
for the protection of 'women travel-,

Chicago, June 9.—Nominations proceeded at the re

peace committee report, Governor Whitman, New York,
nominating Hughes, whose name caused a 20-minute dem

six-minute demonstration. Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler
nominated Elihue Root, and Governor Willis of Ohio,'
nominated Senator Burton.
As Whitman, in closing, mentioned Hughes' name, a
demontration was begun, lasting twenty minutes.
Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler took the platform to offer

Chicago, June DeleMtes to the republican and progressive
national conventions assembled at the Coliseum Mid Auditorium today,
fadng a chaotic situation unprecedented In American political party
history. The progressives faced the gavel at 10 o'clock, the republi
cans resuming deliberations an hour Later.
Uncertainty prevailed, and all eyes were strained to catch the first
possible clearing of the political clouds. No one on the ground was
able to predict on a basis of fact what the next 34 hows might bring
.. out of the haze, whether It will be harmony, a re-united republican
party or disagreement, or dual nominations by the two big conventions.
Thus the situation stood at the opening of the third day's session,
point at which normally all Important subjects of nomination practi
cally have been signed, sealed and ready for delivery.
The day was ushered in with an early morning conference that will
become historic or "peaces committees from opposing camps. 11m
conference adjourned without definite results, according to statements
today, details regarding deliberation being withheld. Another
may be held late today. b*t-Only developments can determine that.

conventions when the conference committees on harmony win annotat*
announcement.:
"It Is underwood .''said Senator Borah, ameanber of tht
can conference committee, just before the conventions antranlilrrt
today, that while the nominating speeches will be made in both con
ventloiM. that no nominations will be made."
"And we'll resume negotiations In the afternoon or evening," added
another member of the committee.
Chairman Harding called the convention to order at 11:18, after
giving die names of conferees on both sides of the republican-progres
sive committee. Hie report, which is to be presented to both conven
tions. will recite that a full, frank conference was held, resulting In an
•f the
agreement that there should be united action on the part of
parties to rescue the country from the present democratic domination.
The report to the republican convention then will recite that die
progressives presented Booseveltfs name for presidential candidate. It
was the plan of the conferees to get together again after two Or three
ballots are cast by the republican convention. The republican mm.
sentatives did not make any counter suggestion regarding a candidate.
The conference committee's report was received with great en
thusiasm. moderate applause greeting the mention of Roosevettfa name.
The last three minutes there was the greatest noise from the galleries.
Chester Condon of Duluth was announced as the choice of the
Minnesota delegation for national committeeman. The convention Con

After Chairman Harding announced that the conference commit
