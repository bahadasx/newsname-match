OFFICER WAYMAN NARROWLY
ESCAPES JUS DEATH
Joo Wayninn, Union Pacific yard
noliccman. had a narrow escaoo from
death, Ihst evening when h was struck
"by Incoming train No. 5, and though
his loft arm was brokon, ho Is no doubt
thankful that ho did not faro worse
As is his custom, Wayman boarded an
. east-bound freight to clear It of any
' hoboes that might bo stealing a ride.
1 Reaching tho cast end of tho yard, ho
Jumped off on tho north Bldo of tho
train, and failed to notice No. 5 np
proachtng. Ho was struck on the
shoulder by the buffer of tho cnglno
and thrown itfvor against tho moving
freight train, and as ho struck it ho
was bounced out toward No. 5 train,
but fortunately foil between tho two
moving trains and clear of tho wheels.
That ho was not thrown under tho
wheels bordered on a miracle.
Train No. 5 was stopped, "Wayman
taken into tho baggago car and when
reaching tho depot was conveyed to a
hospital for treatment.

SLIGHT- CHANCES FOR
AGREEMENT ON CANDIDATE
"While conference committees from
the Republican and Bull Mooso con
ventions aro nttdmptlng to get to
gether on a candidate, the last word
from Chicago indicated that tho pros
pects for an agreement aro slight, and
that It is probable that each conven
tion will place a candidate in tho field.
Tho Bull Moose delegates are. almost
unanimously In favor of Roosevelt's
nomination, and it i generally con
ceded that the conference committee
of that party will hold tenaciously for
for tho Colonel. Tho Republican con
vention is not llkoly to consider
Roosevolt as Its nominee, and Hughes
Is certain to bo nominated on the sec
ond or third ballot.
Howovor, an attempt is being mado
to havo both convention agree upon
Root, but such a result is considered
vory doubtful.
In tho Bull Mooso convention yes
terday afternoon there was a three
hour strugglo to prevent the radical
delegates from rushing headlong into
the nomination of Roosovelt as their
standard bearer. Tho radicals wore
flnnlly induced to agree to tho ap
pointment of a committee to confer
with a like committee from the Re
publican convention in tho hope of
uniting on a candidate agreeable to
both conventions.
The platforms submitted by tho two
conventions aro practcally tho same,
other than that the Bull Mooso has a
woman's suffrage plank while the Re
publican does not.
Should this conference oohimitttoo
fail Ho agree and each convention
places a candidate in tho field tho re
election of President Wilson Is assured.
