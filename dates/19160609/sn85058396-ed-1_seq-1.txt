Auditorium Hall, Chicago, June 9.
12 44 p. m. Without any preliminary
announcement Senator William E.
Borah entered the Auditorium Hall at
12-40 p m. where the Progressives
were assembled In convention. He
was escorted to the platform A tre
mendous ovation was given him.
Chairman Robins introduced Sen
ator Borah and the convention roared
itself hoarse when the senator said ho
had not come officially.
"I will say to you frankly" were his
first words, "I came over here to get
an Inspiration."
No "Canned Enthusiasm."
At once a wave swept over the hall
started, no one knew how, suggesting
that stronger events than harmony,
with Borah as the man to unite the
parties, might happen. This thought
grow as the senator In his speech in
troduced the magic name of "Roose
velt" as the Progressives' great lead
er "We want Teddy" resounded
through the hall and galleries with
more vim than at any time since the
convention assembled. It was not
"canned enthusiasm or if it was,, the
can'ha'd'TnTrs'l'ffbni internal compres
sion. Senator Borah waited quietly and
finally Chairman Robins urged quiet.
"It is well known the deep seated
affection I have for your leader," he
said and was halted by another salvo
of enthusiasm, tho whole convention
in a mighty chant, shouting "We want
Teddy ' for a full minute, while Borah
smilingly waited. The shouting lulled
and then was renewed, leaders on the
stage joining.
"There's no doubt you want Teddy,"
"We want Borah, too," answered
the delegates and the senator proceed
ed, swinging into the stride of his
speech which he promised would be
brief.
Ho put a quietus on the whispered
circulation of his name as a possible
"Moose" by reminding tho Progres
sive convention that he was present
as a member from "another conven
tion." Urges United Party.
"But lot us bear in mind" he urged,
"what these two conventions do here
will perhaps decide the welfare of the
United States for the next quarter
of a century We can only insure
ourselves by working together in close
co-operation. I do not discourage
your loyalty and enthusiasm to your
leader, but I must say It Is essential
that before we leave this great city
it should be definitely determined that
we will march and fight together in
this conflict.
"But if the two conventions agree
upon your great leader you will find
no more enthusiastic supporters than
myself."
Bornh concluded amid applause and
shouts of "Roosevelt and Borah."
As Borah shook hands with the lead
ers on the stage and left, the conven
tion was carried away with the ex
citement of the dramatic development.
Leaders Make Decision.
When the. leaders got time to
breathe again, they conferred on tho
course to be followed by the conven
tion and decided to be regulated by
the action of the Republicans. Fre
quent bulletins were telephoned to
the Auditorium stage by a Progressive
representative at the Coliseum, so the
Progressives were always abreast the
action of the Republicans.
It was agreed that if the Republican
convention gave no signs of making
a nomination, that the Progressive
convention would transact other rou
tine business. Should a nomination
by tho Republicans appear Imminent,
however, It was agreed, the Progres
sives immediately would nominate
Col. Roosevelt.
Several Progressive leaders, includ
ing Mr. Perkins, Governor Johnson,
James R. Garfield and Henry M. Allen
withdrew to a private room In tho
lower part of he convention hall while
the platform reading was In progress
to discuss a program in case the Re
publican convention did not nominate.
They understood that the Republican
convention would adjourn immediate
ly after two ballots had been taken
on tho presidential nominee, provided
there was no nimination at that time.
Coliseum, Chicago, Juno 9. Senator
Smoot and Former Senator Crane,
when they learned that Senator Borah
had gone to the Progressive conven
tion, said lit was entrely a personal
matter with him and tttat ho went at

The delegates from tho favorite son
states came prepared with flags and
noise-making machines for the dem
onstrations. Chairman Harding kept on banging
the gavel and Colonel Stone, the ser-geant-at-arms,

was slow.

Wilson Must Be Defeated.
The conference was frank, free and
most friendly. The conferees wore
of one mind In believing that the good
of tho country and perhaps its re
pute and influence for years to come,
depends upon the complete defeat of
tho present Democratic administra
tion and the restoration of tho con
trol of the executive and legislative
branches of the government to the
hands of those who firmly believe in
and will execute the policies that aro
so heartily supported by the Republi
can and Progressive parties alike.
Progressives Solid for Roosevelt.
The Progressive convention con
ferees were unanimous in urging tem
perateness and fairness to the opin
ion that Theodore Roosevelt of New
York had so large a per cent follow
ing and such a close personal rela

paign as to make him the most desir

Coliseum, Chicago, June 9. The Re
publican national convention lato this
afternoon was in session with the an
nounced purpose of remaining continu
ously at work until a presidential can
didate is nominated.
During the first four hours of the
session Justice Hughes, former Sena
tor Burton of Ohio, Elihu Root and
Senator Weeks of Massachusetts and
Senator Sherman of Illinois were
placed in nomination. Senator Fall of
New Mexico was waiting to nominate
Colonel RoosevelL The list of other
favorite sons remained to be present
ed and the prospects were that when
nominations weer closed one ballot or
possibly two might be taken before
the convention adjourned tomorrow.
Coliseum. Chicago, June 9. The big
business of the convention was the
nomination of candidates.
"The roll of states was called and
Alabama, Alaska passed. Arizona
yielded to Nov York.
An Arizona member challenged the
yielding and the delegation was pol
led. Tho "ayes" had It and Governor
Whitman of New York, was recogniz
ed and took the platform to nominate
Justice Hughes. The demonstration
subsided while Governor Whitman
"was Introduced.
His declaration that "Wo are to
choose the next president," was ap
plauded. Then the governor went on to a de
nunciation of President Wilson's for
eign policy and a declaration that the
prosperity of the country only was
temporary and dependent wholly on
the war. For the times to come, he
declared, the nation called for "our
greatest statesmen and' the Republi
can party."
There was a demonstration when
Governor Whitman mentioned the
name of William H. Taft. The dele
gates rose cheering and waving their
hats. It was the longest demonstra
tion of the convention so far.
When it showed signs of dying
away the cheer leaders started it up
again and it was six minutes before
Governor Whitman resumed.
A member of the peace conference
committee said tho demonstration was
regarded as "unofficial Instructions."
When Mr. Whitman quoted from an
eight-yenr-old speech of Justice
Hughes declaring for "adequate provi
sion for our defense and maintenance
of the efficiency of the army and
navy," there was more applause.
Some of the New Yorkers sat down
and let the others carry on the noiBe
which tho New York delegation was
consistently leading most of the time.
The demonstration ebbed and flowed.

them but to the great nation her
son, her noblest and her best.
"I nominate as tho Republican can
didate for president of the t United
States, Charles Evans Hughes of New

The convention broke into an up
roar while the band played.
The Hughes men in tho New York
delegation led the cheering. The oth
er delegates from the "favorite son"
states for the most part kept tholr
seats. Tho cheers and applause, how
ever, were general on the floor and
galleries.
A man on tho platform started
"Hughes, Hughes, we want Hughes,"
and the enthusiasts caught the point
and took up the shout.
When the noise had been in full

Harding tried to gavel It down. The
crowd replied with renewed cheering
The chairman shouted calls for or
