"BRINGING BACK THE WILD"
Zfy Wednesday Evening
Tht. -o empty seats at the
Baptist cu. Wednesday evening
when Warwick S. Carpenter, the pub
licity man for the Xew York conserva
tion department, gave his series of
moving pictures and lecture on "Bring
ing Hack the Wild."
Nearly all of the films shown were
made by Mr. Carpenter since he be
came connected with the conservation
department and they show the actual
work as it is done in the different en
deavors that the commissioner is try
ing to carry out.
The pictures showed the work of the
forest fire patrols in New York, the
reforesting of treeless areas and the
methods of fish propagation and re
stocking of streams and lakes.
An interesting feature, which has
been given considerable publicity by
the newspapers, was the removal of
doer from Shelter Island. Another
was a reel showing the release of a
number of elk in the Adirondacks. A
short time ago Mr. Carpenter made a
reel showing two liennington young
men, If. T. Soulhall and Frank Rous
seau planting trout in the Dunville
stieam and the picture was shown
Wednesday evening.
A defect in the moving picture ma
chine detracted somewhat from the
enjoyment of the pictures, which was
much regretted by the members of the

Colonial Regiments Lose Heavily
in
One Week's Fighting.
Ottawa, June 8. Upwards of 6,000
Canadians have fallen within a week
in the desperate fighting in and uround
Sanctuary Woods, according to a
statement made by Major Gen. Sir
Sam Hughes, Minister of Militia, in
presenting colors to a Canadian regi
ment on Parliament Hill today.
"The great majority wounded," he
said," "already are clamoring to get
back into the fray, but many of the
gallant lads have gone down never to
rise again. We deeply mourn their loss,
but that loss affords an inspiration for
tens of thousands more to take their
place."
Some details of the fighting came
thiough today. General Hughes re
ceived a cable message from the front
6tatlng that Captain Nivin of the Prin
cess Patricia had again distinguished
himseK'. Wounded on Friday he was
taken back and treated at a dressing
station. Ho went to the front trenches
on Saturday; wa3 again wounded.
taken hack and dressed. Was at the
front again Sunday and was sent back
for further treatment.
Chaplain Wilkes, according to the
message, carried a rule into tne ngtit.
He used It as long as ho could and
then welldeil a bayonet until the en
counter became too close for either,
when he went down using his fists.
Colonel Puller, Commander of the
Princess I'ats, was killed. He had been
a member of the Duke of Connaught's
Canadian household, like the men who
preceded him. Colonel Farquhar was
killed at the head of the Princess I'ats
a year ago. A cable to General Hughes
today announced that Colonel Bailor
had been buried in Colonel Farquhar's
grave in Flanders.
The regiment has been shot to pieces
three times and is now back from the
front waiting lor men to fill the gaps
that It may return to the fighting line.
Thus far 334,209 Canadians have
been enlisted for dverseas service.
BRITISH ISSUES DENTAL
Admiralty Says Complete List of Loss
Has Been Made Public.
London, Juno 8 The following Brit
ish official communication was issued
this evening:
"In the German olllclal account of
the North Sea battle which appeared
in the Dutch papers this morning, the
loss of the Lutzow, the Rostock and
Elbinir was admitted. In addition to
the l'ommern and Frauenlob, which
was announced in the German olllclal
communication' of June 1. But the los3
of the Wiesbaden, which was announc

The German official account re
peats that the Warspite, Princess Roy

sunk. They were not Bunk, but are
safe in port, and the repetition of this
false statement compels a repetition
of the former statement by tho British
Admiralty cf the 0th of June, 'This Is
false. A complete list of the British
losses has been made public' '
The acknowledged loss of the battle
cruiser Lutzow and tho light cruiser
Rostock brings the German admitted

THREATEN TO
I
Ready to Nominate RooseveltWhen
Republicans Begin to Vote
LITTLE FAITH IN CONFERENCE
Every Indication That Break Will
Come During Session This
Afternoon.
Chicago, June 9. The progressive
convention convened at 10.20 this morn
ing. The radicals were tl.en contend
ing that Roosevelt should be nominat
ed at once, but the conservative lead
ers were for withholding any action
until after the conference report had
been received. The break was ex
pected to come immediately after vot
ing began in the republican conven
tion. Chicago, June 9. The progressive
national convention met in two tumult
uous sessions at Auditorium hall,
yesterday, and adjourned last night un
til 10 a. in. today. The principal busi
ness of the day was the approval of a
plan to confer on peace plans with the
republican convention. Throughout
the day the leaders kept control over
the delegations, more by persuasion
and by canstant repetition of Chairman
Robins' promise that the majority
would decide any questions that arose
than by any actual hold they had
upon the delegations. The same de
termination to , nominate Theodore
Roosevelt was evident from the time
the first delegation trooped in just
after 1 o'clock, until the last went out
just before 9 o'clock last night.
Leaders made no effort to conceal
their belief that failure of the confer
ence to agree or to find some possible
basis for an agreement would result In
but one thing the immediate nom
ination of Col. Roosevelt. In tho
words of Chairman Robins, "tomorrow
probably will be a big day'' in the con
vention. Only by many promises to
place no obstacle In the way of the
nomination of Col. Roosevelt were the
delegates content to adjourn and
await results from the conferees.
The convention spent about four
hour3 in session, ending with a per
functory night gathering which re
sulted mostly in singing and cheering.
During the day the temporary organi
zation was made permanent and the
platform of the resolutions commit
tee was received, read and made the
unfinished business.
Edward Walling Bradford
The remains of Edward Walling
Bradford were brought from New York
to Bennington on yesterday afternoon
and the funeral services, which will
be private, will be held from his lafe
residence tomorrow, Saturday, morn
ing at 10.30 o'clock, the Rev. W. G.
Towart of the First Baptist church of
iennington officiating.
Mr. Bradford was born at Benning
ton on January 23, 1S00 the son of
Henry K. and Eleanor Abbott Bradford
and was married to Minerva Lawrence
on March 17th, 1SS0. He Is survived
by his widow, by a brother, William
Bradford, a sister, Mrs. Charles H
Dewey, both of Bennington and by a
sister, Mrs. Chester J. Reynolds, of
Detroit, Michigan. He was the junior
ncmber of the firm of H. E. Bradford
& Co., becoming a member of that firm
when but eighteen years of age and
thereafter devoting himself to
thoroughly learning the intricacies of
tho successful manufacture of knit
uoods. Mr. Bradford was a member
of all the Masonic bodies, an honorary
member of Custer Post, G. A. R, cf
Bennington Club and other social or
ganlzatlons. He was of a most genial
and generous disposition, helpful and
encouraging to many, firm in bis
friendships, reliable In every business,
social and fraternal undertaking, and
strong In his convictions.
Mr. Bradford s death followed a
major operation for Sarcoma per
formed by Dr. William Seaman Bain
bridge at Polyclinic Hospital, New
York City, on Monday last in a vain at
tempt to thus arrest the progress of
the disease so rapidly developed. Mrs.
Edward W. Bradford and Mrs. C. J

the hospital.
Blackbird Days.
Jan. 30 ami "1 and Feb. 1 tire famous
at Constant inople, Brescia and along
the Danube ami the Rhine as the
"blackbird days." A curious legend
says that originally nil species of crack
les (blackbirds) were white and thnt
they became Mack because during one
year In tho middle ages tho three days
mentioned above were so cold that nil
the birds In Europe took refuge In the
chimneys. At Brescln the three days
nre celebrated with a feast called "1
glornl delhi inerln." or "the feast of tho
transformation of the bird."
CLOSE "WEST END" ROAD
Made Necessary by Construction
of
Permanent Highway.
After Monday next the road through
Old Bennington into New York state
will be closed to permit the construc
tion of the permanent highway. Work
on the road has been in progress for
several weeks and has now reached a
stage when the contractor ha3 decided
that the way, must be closed. It is not
likely that the road will bo open for
travel during the next two months.
Three ways will be open for traffic
into and out of Bennington. Automo
bilists will probably find it to their
advantage and comfort when coming
toward Bennington to turn from
the main highway in the vicinity of the
Farmers Inn and take tho road through
Hinsdillville. The road through Pleas
ant valley is In good condition, but it
is narrow in places and therefore not
an advisable route for large cars.
Signs advertising the closing of the
road will be placed at several points
in order that tourists may be put to
the least possible inconvenience. The
Bennington authorities will also en
deavor to enlist the co-operation of the
New York state highway department
to put up signs in the town of llooslck
notifying tourists of the closing of
the road.

Through the co operation of boards
of trade, hotel men and photographers
in loaning large photographs of Ver
mont scenery the lobbies of Montpeller
hotels during the annual meeting of
The Greater Vermont association, July
12 and 13 will become picture galleries
of Vermont scenery. The proprietors
of the Montpeller hotels have kindly
consented thus to aid The Greater Ver
mont association in making a demon
stration of what the association thinks
ought to take place Jin the lobby of
every Vermont hotel. The walls of
the public rooms of hotels form Ver
mont advertising space which ought to
be used for the advertising of Vermont
attractions, local and stale. The fol
lowing letter has been sent to Vermont
boards of trade, hotel men and pho
tographers:
To Vermont Boards of Trade, Hotel

proprietors of the city of Montpelier
the Gi eater Vermont association will
be permitted to use the walls of the
public rooms of the hotels for a dis
play of large photographs of scenes
from every region of Vermont. In this
way we shall ho able to show what
Vermont1 hotel lobbies ought to look
like.
To make this scheme a success we
must secure the co-operation of every

It is suggested that in every com

PEACE COUITTEE
HELD All RIGHT
Only Result is to Create More
Uncertainty
REPUBLICANS ADOPT PLATFORM
Favors Woman Suffrage But Recog
nizes Right of Each State to
Settle Question.
Chicago, June 8. The conference
committees of the Republican and Pro
giesive conventions began discussion
for peace plans at 10:40 p. m., tonight
and Senator Borah, one of the Republi
can conferees, predicted the session
would last at least three hours.
This was the situation as epitomized
by one of the conferees after the con
ference had been in session a little
moro than an hour:
The utmost harmony had reigned in
the meeting.
Republican were Impressed with
the apparent desire of the Progres
sives to effect an agreement. No
name, except that of Colonel Roosevelt
had been mentioned. Progressives,
while showing a decided preference for
Colonel Roosevelt as the nominee, did
not say they would not support any
other man.
The name of Hughes had not been
mentioned.
Encouraged by the happy opening of
the conference, it was said there was a
possibility that the conferees would re
main in session most of the night or
until they had reached some tangible
agreement, or complete disagreement.
The Progressive conference commit
tee consists of George W. Perkins,
Governor Hirman Johnson, Horace
Wilkinson, Charles J. Bonaparte and
John M. Parker.
Senator Reed Snioot of Utah, Sena
tor William E. Porau of Idaho, former
Senator W. Murray Crane of Massa
chusetts. Nicholas Murray Butler of
the New York delegation and former
Representative A. R. Johnson of Iron-
ton, ()., were appointed as the Repub
lican conference committee.
The Republican committee Is com
posed of men who are regarded as op
posed to the nomination of Colonel
Roosevelt but not opposed to the eli
mination of Justice Hughes.
The Progressive eonfertes are gener
ally regarded as men who will insist
on the colonel's nomination.
The acceptance by both conventions
of the peace conference proposal threw
the situation into a new uncertainty.
Hughes supporters and many other Re
puLlican leaders felt that it cannot pre
vent the nomination of the justice but
(he development has had the effect of
holding off expected crystallization up
on Justice Hughes in tho Republican
convention.
Those who were confident that some
harmonious action would come out of
tho peace conferences, pointed out that
the Progressives are in the position of
having as yet adopted no platform and
that there was more than a possibility
that if the conferees can reach an
agreement, the Republicans will meet
the situation by taking some of the
Progressive planks into their own plat
t'oim. Some of the Progressive lead
ers professed to have word from the in
side ol the Republican convention that
this would bo done.
The other principal developments In
the Republican convention were the
adoption of the platform as reported
by the resolutions committee, headed
by Senator Lodge: a half minute of
demonstration for Colonel Roosevelt
when his name was mentioned for the
first time in the convention; tho per
fection of the permanent organization
and adjournment until 11 a. m. tomor
row.
Senator I-odge mentioned Colonel
Roosevelt's name in reading the Philip
pines plank which declares for the
policy Inaugurated by McKlnley and
continued by Roosevelt. The demon
stration that followed was principally
in the galleries, although it was joined
by some delegates on the floor. Senator
Lodge, well Identified as a personal
friend of the colonel's, smiled and
waited and it subsided in less than a
minute by the watch.
The outstanding Incident of the
days session came with Senator
hedge's announcement of the woman
suffrage plank.
"The Republican party, rcalllrmln
Its lalth In government of the people
by the people and for the people as a
measure of Justice to one half the
adult people of this country, favors the
exteution of suffrages to women," read
the senator, nnd there ho paused, whil
the suffragists began their domonstra
(Ion
"But,"' continued Senator Lodge
when the noise subsided, "It recognizes
the right of ench state to settle this
question for Itself."
There were roars of laughter at this
qualifying phrase to what the suffrag
ists had celebrated as a clear cut vh
lory, and the hall rang with the dem
