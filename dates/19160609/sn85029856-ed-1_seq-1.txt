oughly familiar with the equipment
and methods of fighting a large fire
, should one break out. Chief Kindshl
requests that when the alarm Is giv
en that the citizens get. out of the
way of the firemen and not interfere
with their efforts. They figure on

, to see the boys go after' this fire
flighting game in such- business like
; manner and hopes the people of Lib
eral will co-operate with them In

REFUSED THE PETITION'S
Several petitions from the citizens
of Fargo township were presented
the- county commissioners at their
regular sesslon4h'is week, asking tor
a division Of 'said township. The
township Is too large for one asses
sor to cover in the time allotted for
such work, and it Is claimed that a
number of taxpayers were missed en
tirely during the last year or two.
The intention was to cut the town
ship in two east and west, naming
the north half Kismet township and
leaving the south half under the
present name of Fargo. After due
consideration by the county commis
sioners the petitions were turned
down on the grounds that the popu
lation of the entire township at this
time is not sufficient to justify mak
lng two out the same.
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MEET.
ING
The Chamber' of Commerce wU
hold Its regular meeting on Friday,

from the Sheldon School of Chicago,
is to be there and deliver a lecture.
Mr. Ooffe is a good talker and a prac
tical business man, and his talk will
be of vital interest to every business
man In Liberal. The various com
mittees of the organization also have
some interesting reports to make and
all members are requested to be
present.

This is the time of the year when
the housewives are doing their spring

A GLORIOUS RAIN
Nearly two and a fourth inches of
rain fell Sunday night. It started
falling tabout ,6 . o'clock that after
noon and kept tt up practically all
night, with the result that the
ground is now thoroughly soaked
and crops are looking up in great
style. Wheat was suffering quite
badly from lack of moisture and in
many places had started heading
while the stalk was very short. Some
of it will not benefit by the rain but
that which was planted later ' will
come on and still make a good crop.
The' row crops were not suffering to
any great extent as yet, but the good
rain will help it wonderfully. It has
put the ground in good shape for
summer plowing and we presume the
farmers will get busy as soon as the
wheat and other grain crops are out
of the way. It was one of the old
fashioned rains that fell, steadily
without much wind, and extended
over a large scope of country. No
hall is reported around here during
the rain, which' Is fortunate, as other
sections of the state have been re
porting considerable hall duflng the
last few weeks.

MUSIC WHILE YOU EAT

champagne fountain flowing at
my ?et, .
I'd like to stand, in with the Steel
' . Trost raka-oftY ," ('
Hear Sousa's band a-playlng while
I eat."
You may not be able to enjoy all
the above pleasures of the "idle rich"
but you can get a small taste of the
last one right here in Liberal. The
Keystone Hotel has engaged the Ma-
Jestio theatre orchestra to play dur
ing the noon hour each day and on
Sunday evenings, and Wiley's drug
store has engaged them to furnish
music on Sunday afternoon, hence
you can eat your noonday meal at
the Keystone or your Ice cream at
Wiley's on Sunday afternoons, to the
sweet strains of pleasant mus'c.
Both institutions give up-to-the-minute
service in their lines and the ad
dition of the musical trdht shows they
strive to please their patrons in every
detail.
DEMOCRATIC MASS MEETING

FOR COUNTY COMMISSIONER
The Democrat is authorized to an
nounce Jhe candidacy of J. F. Fuest ' '
for denomination to the office of
county commissioner from the Sec
ond district. Mr. Fuest has been
county commissioner for a long
time, in fact, when his present term
expires he will have filled the office
for twenty-tour consecutive years,
during all of which, with the excep
tion of his first term, he has acted
as chairman of that body. That his '
services have been eminently satis- -factory
is undoubtedly afact, or the
people of this district would not have
kept him there so long. The only
thing we know against him is that he
is a Republican. .Aside from
that he is a good Dutchman and has
a good record. Mr. Fuest will un
doubtedly have no opposition in his
party during the coming, primary, '
and as yet we have heard of no one
tb oppose him In the general election. '
We recommend his candidacy to the
careful consideration of the Republi
can voters of the Second district.
CHAMBER OF COMMERCB .
WOOD PILE IS THRIVING
Up to the present time about thirty
husky workers have applied at the
Chamber of Commerce office for a
Job on the wood pile. These men
have all seemed glad of an opportuni
ty to earn their aneals and lodging
rather than to beg them from the
citizens. The pile is steadily grow
ing and the prospects are that there
will be no kindling famine this com
ing winter as there has been In the
past.
The people of- the town have been
co-operating with the Chamber of
Commerce by calling them up when
ever they send a man to them, and
in almost every Instance the man
has shown up soon afterward. A
good many of the men have been
given odd Jobs elsewhere when they
applied at the office and the secretary
asks that if you have any small jobs
of any kind to notify the office and
they will have a man for you in a
very tew moments.
, ' : THE ROOSTER TRIP .
The business men of Liberal who
expect to make the trip with the Lib-, ' '
eral Boosters next month should"
make sure that they have plenty of
advertising to take along on the
trip. Last year's trip was gotten
up hurriedly and without sufficient
time In which to make the proper v
preparations, and this mistake
should not be repeated. Plenty ot
time Is being taken for the trip this
year and there should be no excuse
for anyone's failure to provide him
self with ample advertising matter
to scatter along the -route. The
Democrat Is well equipped to turn
out this kind of work on short notice
and would be pleased to make esti
mates on the' price of the same.' We
can handle two-color Jobs If such are
desired and will guarantee a satis
factory Job every shot. The trip will
be made between July 10 and 24,
and It isn'a a bit too early to begin
figuring on the advertising stunts.
RETAILERS MEETING
The Retailers Association met last
Friday evening and adopted the con- -stltutlon
and by-laws. A committee
was appointed to establish a stand-'
ard of dues and the regular meeting
night was set for the second Monday
of each month. The grocers met
Monday evening and established a
uniform standard for handling eggs
and decided to keep their stores open
later than usual for the next few
months.
