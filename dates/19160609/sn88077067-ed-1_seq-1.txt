Yesterday, tho last day for filing
of nomination papers, brought forth
all the announced candidate for the
various offices of tho county.
No now candidates were added to
the already IIk Democratic lint of office-seekers,
hut a surprise, or a rude
shock, was felt In the Republican
ranks when Kx-Muyor C. I). Hlce filed
In oppoHitlon to Chas. W. Ilalfhill,
the (date candidate for Ropresonta
tlve. The local boom for Hon. John W.
Loreo for Congress, fell a bit short,
as that worthy gentleman could not
see the easy sliding fore-casted byitiis
friends and recalling the memorable
several weeks' convention fight of
twelve years ago, when Harvey ear
ner copped the persimmons, said "nix
Pauline, let John Henry and Hand

The Hon. .Tolm AY. Couldn't. Iteml
His Title Clear to l-'otirth
District Honor
And now it's Mercer!
With the exception of the above named
county, every part of the Fourth congres
sional district has nt some time or other
during the last six months has trotted
out a dark horse for the democratic nom
ination. Most of them have been led back
to the stall to await the next race, but a
few of them have stuck. Some have balk
at the performance because of the crowd
ed condition of the track, while other
have started off all the faster because of
competition. Mercer has contented her
self with running Senator James 1). John
son for the appelate bench. Mayor S. S.
Scrunton pulling out of the senatorial
fight partly becuu.se of it. Rut now Mer
cer baa sprung John W. Loree for Con
gress. The veteran attorney has never tried to
grab much in the way of political honor,
although lie has been prosecutor nearly
every uttorney In a county that size has
been prosecutor. Rut hark to the manner
in which the Celina Standard tips off Lo
ree as the specillc for the present Ills of
the district.
"Auglaize county has no candidate.
Darke county has no candidate, Allen
county has not singled out and cemeted
upon anv one man,. Shelby county has two
t"adldates, and so It would seem thai
it was the opportune time for Mercer
county to name the man, particularly as
he could bring to his support the solid
backing of his borne county and could
no doubt rally Darke and Auglaize to
bis standard."
John W. has watled until pretty late
In the game to start his candidacy, but
it is not wholly out of the ituestlon that
he will tile his paper tomorrow. The en
tries close when the Mercer county elec
tion board clerk gets tired sitting around
and vearns for supper. This gives the
Celinu attorney less than twent" four
hours to make up bis mind whether or
not the chance Is worth twenty-tlive Iron
men known us dollars. At a rough guess
however, it would seem that Loree will
remain In the large "mentioned class"
which includes the many -who have "been
urged by hosts of friends to accept the
nomination." Lima Times Democrat,

money drawer she found the follow
ing note, signed by her husband:
"Don't worry. 1 have paid all the
debts and if you care for my body
you will find it in the bottom or the
reservoir."
The officers were at once consulted
but up to last night no clew had been
obtained. It was rumored thai le
had lert town on the 8:22 Western
Ohio Traction car, but fne story has
not been vertified.
While officers do not believe that
the young man took his life in the
reservoir, a watch of the waters will
be kept for the next several days,
when the body would come to the
urface, if he had done so. He has
a wife and two smal children. He Is

ic party would have been retained in
power. He asserted that the people
of the state realize now the wisdom
of this legislation anrt will restore

Senator I'omerene, in his address,
asserted the people of Ohio realize

THIS M.W JAK VOl'. VOl Ml MAN
There are thousands of men In the
State of Ohio who ate now members
of the slato militia and do not know
it. This Is the result of the passage
of (he I'nlted States statute which
says that "Tho militia frhall consist
of every able bodied citizen who Is
more than IS and leas than 4 0 vears
of age."
This will probably surprise many
preparedness advocates who did not
suppose the generul enlistment would
Include them.

FOURTH DISTRICT
.Muddle reimentes Ken Slale Con

mi Committee on Rules
David W. Bowman in Lima Times
Democrat of June 2.
Fourth district politics turned ovt
to be the feature of the state con
vention gathering at Columbus yes
terday. Not that it actually entered
into the deliberations of the demo
crats or the 88 counties, but because
in the Neil lobby, where rcores of
congressmen and several United
States senators have been made and
unmade, the Fourth Ohio predomin
ated in representatives, activity and
interest.
Cunningham, Goecke, Studevaut,
Kiddle and Coombes were on the job.
Hussey and Hunt may have been
there, but not very long if at aU- In
every county delegation there were
politicians with some sort of a deal
ready to spring. Rumors of the most
impossible nature circulated. Grape
vines grew, flourished and withered
within an hour. Only two stories,
however, received enough attention
to become the common gossip of the
district delegation.
The first was to the effect that ir
the Goeke forces were ready to con
centrate oi) Coombes as a compro
mise candidate, subject to the with
drawal of the other candidates. This
was soon followed by the report that
Cunningham could not be budged,
despite the declaration that the rest
wi re willing. This bears out the be
lie.' now common that "Dick" is in
the light to a finish .intends to sit
tight and the man who dislodges him
w,l! need blasting powder.
Coombs was postive ill one thing
he will stand as a compromise can
didate, but will not enter a free-for-all.
His friends in Miami too, said
that Jell is too good a man to be
banged up in an eight or ten corner
ed light. The Mannix boom got start
ed once, but as George was not on
the field, his adherents evidently de
cided to wait until they bad him han
dy for display. Then Studevant
started calling his attention to his
recent satement in the Sidney Daily
News to the fact that he is running
a free lance and not as a candidate
of another. Riddle was ill, butnot
to ill to discuss crops with rural del
egates. About this time Ad Meeker,
of Greenville, arrived with a couple
of mysterious references to the next
lew days, thereby messing up the sit
uation a little more.

former circulated about with a de

ing that he was ready to meet all
newcomers. "The more the merrier"
was his reception of the rumors of

Further interest was injecteo into

V. D. Miller, of this city, member
of the Tuscarawas county board of
elections, won his mandamus pro
ceeding In common pleas court, Mon
day morning, when Judge Mitchell
announced that Miller was entitled
to $14 from .County Auditor Nuss
dorfer for services performed during
the presidential primary last month.
The case was held last week. The
defense tiled a demurrer to the man
damus petition, but Judge Mitchell,
Monday, said he had over-ruled the
demurrer.
The case will no doubt be carried
to the appeal court which conveues
here early in June.
Boards of election all over the
.late, will no doubt be jubilant as a
result of the ruling of Judge Mitch
ell. Election board members had
visions of having their warrants, filed
with county auditors, ignored
through an order of Attorney Gener
al Turner.
Miller started his case with a
double purpose. The first was to col
lect money which he thought due him
and the second for test purposes.
The defense was represented In court
last week by Prosecuting Attorney
Lindsay and an attorney from the at
torney general's ollice. Miler's at
torneys were J. C. Mitchell and H. I.

Who will be the Winers in the boys'
and girls' club work being conducted
in Mercer county throughout tha co
operation of the county school sup
erintendent and the fair association
with the Agricultural College exten
sion service of the Ohio State Uni
versity? The total enrollment of all
the clubs in the county is now 113;
Gti are in the pig growing clubs, 13
in the poultry raising and 44 in the
home making clubs.
During June and July a specialist
from the University will visit the
club members and give them instruc
tion in the canning of fruits and veg
atables and the growing of live stock.
At the county fair this fall the boys
and girls in the pig growing contests
will exhibit their products and com
pete in the judging contests. The
girls in the home making clubs will
exhibit bread, canned fruit and veg
etables. Through the summer the
members of the clubs will receive in
structions by bulletins from the uni
versity.
Liberal prizes have been offered by
Ihe fair association for the winners
in each of the club projects and the

ord wil be given a free trip to Colum
bus to the Ohio State University s
farmer's week next year. The cham
pion girl of the county will receive
a week of free instruction at the Col
lege of Agriculture.
The club work is the result of a
nationwide movement by the United
.States Department of Agriculture
in interesting farm boys and girls
in becoming the be stfarmers of the
nation. In many states the girls have
canned large amounts of garden pro
ducts that were formerly wasted
and boys have shown that they can
raise pork better than their fathers.
