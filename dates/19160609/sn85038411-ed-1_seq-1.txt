Chicago. 111., June 9.—When
one invades the tield of prophesy
he must he prepared for every
eventuality. Several times this
week the hourly developments
have promised the fulfillment of
my prediction that actual reunion
of the Republican factions in the
National arena would he accom
plished here under the inspiration
of Colonel Roosevelt. Radicals
in both camps have endeavored
to discourage peace negotiations
and all manner of resistance to
these overtures has developed.
Meanwhile the conservatives on
all sirles have steadily pressed
forward toward the main objective
which is so absolutely necessary
to Republican success this year.
Without substantial union of
the two wings of the party it is
admitted that the campaign is
scarcely worth the waging. Twice
this week when peace upon the
surface seemed remote wc have
ventured the prophecy that the
convention would end in harmony
and with the Colonel leading the
"reunited host. It doesn't follow
that he will be the chosen stand
bearer, but the fact remains that
the Progressives will not return
to the fold without his guidance.
With the appointment of con
ference committees late yesterday
afternoon the first concrete ac
tion in the "get together" move
ment was taken.
Of course the Progressive con
ferees will do their utmost to have
the Republican section of the
commtitee accept Roosevelt as the
most available and popular
choice. Should they fail in this it
will then be the big undertaking
of the Republican conferees to
persuade their Progressive asso
ciates to recede from this posi
tion and agree to accept Hughes
or another candidate. It is ex

TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL
CONVENTION:
Your committee appointed pursuant 1
to the resolution adopted at yester
day's session met in conference with
a committee representing the national
Progressive convention last evening.
That the Progressive committee of,
conference consisted of Messrs. Per
kins. of New York; Johnson, of Cali
fornia, Bonaparte, OT Maryland; Wil
kinson. of New York, and Parker, of
Louisiana. The conference was frank,
free and mostly, fiicndly. The con
ferees were of one mind in believing
that the Rood of the country and per
haps its repute and influence for years
to come depend upon the complete
defeat of the present Democratic ad
ministration and the restoration of the
control of the legislative and executive
branches of the government to the
hands of those who firmly believe in
and will execute the policies that are
so heartily supported by the Repub
lican and the Progressive parties alike.
The Progressive conferees were
unanimous In urging with temperate
ness and fairness the opinion that
Theodore Roosevelt, of New York, had 1
so large a personal following and such
a close personal relation to the issues
of the coming campaign as to make
him the most desirable candidate upon
which to unite.
It was agreed that your conferees
would report these facts to this con
vention. Respectfully submitted,
