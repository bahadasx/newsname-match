SUFFRAGE VOTE
CLOSE IN IOWA
Returns Indicate Amendment
Has Carried.
..................
+ Des Moines, June 6.--Anti- +
. suffrage leaders declared their +

. ................
Des Moines, June 6.-Equal suffrage
probably has carried in Iowa. Late re
turns from the state primary indi
cate the amendment has won, but by a
much smaller majority than expected
by the women workers.
Mississippi river counties, virtually
without exception, it is believed, voted
down the amendment. In the central,
-western and northern tiers of coun
ties returns indicate "votes for wom
en" will get a safe majority. Noth
ing has been heard from the southern
section, although the suffragist forces
are claiming victory there.
William L. Harding of Sioux City
was the choice of the Republican
voters of tht state for the guberna
torial nomination, acccrding to re
turns.
Senator Joseph Allen of Pocahontas
and Attorney General George Cosson
of Audubon were running neck and
neck for second place. Carl Kuehnle
is a poor third.
As regards statt offices little is
known. The heavy vote coupled with
the fact that the precincts are isolat
ed and returns are coining in slow and
in a garbled manner have made tabu
iation virtually impossible.
There were no contests cn the Dem
ocratic ticket.
PABLO LOPEZ IS EXECUTED
Ciihuahua City, June 6.-Pablo Lo
per. Villa's chief lieutenant in the
raid on Columbus, N. M., paid the
penalty for his crimes, facing a firing
squad of Constitutionalist soldiers at
Canta Rosa.
Lopez who, at the order of Villa,
massacred eighteen American mining
men at Santa Ysabel, Chihuahua, in
January, and who is said to have di
rected the movements of the Mexi
cans at Columbus, expressed no re
gret.
The officer in command gave the
cider to present arms, Lopez raised
his head, smiled until his teeth
showed, and then, looking directly at
the soldiers, said:
".n the breast, brothers; in the
breast."
All the shots struck in or near the
heart of the bandit. killing him in
stantly. As he leaped forward and
fell unconscious on his face the cus
ton ary final two shots of grace were
fired.
M'ADOO TO MANAGE
WILSON CAMPAIGN
Chicago, June 6.-Secretary of the
Treasury William G. McAdoo, Presi
dent Wilson's son-in-law, is slated to
become the chairman of the Demo
cratic national committee and assume
active management of the president's
campaign for re-election. Mr. McAdoo
will resign as secretary of the treas
ury immiediately upon his election to
the chairmanship.
A serious obstacle may be an ob
juctito by the national committee to
goine outside its own membership to
get a chairman.
F( cretary McAdoo, everybody seems
to agree, is in condition to qualify as
afi expert gatherer of the ready mon
ey necessary.
LODGE MAY BE CHAIRMAN
Chicago, June 6.-Senator Lodge of
Massachusetts is expected to be chos
en r hairman of the resolutions com
mittee of the Republican convention.
Smnator Lodge arrived here with the
:Massachusetts delegation, which se
lected him to represent the state on
the committee which will frame the
platform.
Senator Borah of Idaho, who will
represent his state on the resolutions
committee, also arrived.
More Marines for Domingo.
Washington, June 6.-The United
States transport Hancock, at Vera
Cruz, has been ordered to proceed im
mediately to New Orleans to take
aboard between 500 and 600 addition
al mnarirtes for Santo Domingo.
CATHOLIC PICNIC AND
DIXON-RONAN BALL CAME
The ladies of the Ronan Catholic
Guild will hold a picnic in Piedalue's
grove next Sunday, to which every
body is invited. Bring your lunch
baskets and eat dinner in the grove.
In the afternoon there will be a ball
game on the Ronan diamond between
Dixon and Ronan. This game will
probably be one of the best played
here this season, as the Dixon boys
have a strong organization. They
played St. Ignatius last Sunday, losing
by a score of 3 to 4, which shows that
they are playing good ball.
RONAN IS VISITED
BY SAFE BLOWERS
Shortly after midnight Monday night,
as nearly as can be determined, the
safe in the Ronan Mercantile Co's.
store was dynamited and $155.00 in
cash taken from the cash drawer. The
burglars gained entrance to the store
by way of a rear window, which they
broke besides removing the putty from
the sash holding the glass. Once in
side they drilled a hole in the safe
about. four or five inches above the
combination levers and had wrapped
the safe with several pairs of new
overalls taken from the stock on hand.
Besides the money in the safe, they
secured $5.00 in small change from the
cash register, which had been pried
open, although it was unlocked. The
total loss will be close to $250, counting
money stolen and what it will cost to
replace the door to the safe and the
repairs to the cash register.
Deputy Sheriff Engle heard the ex
plosion, but says it was not an unusual
noise, and that he afterward heard
somebody crank an auto and immed
iately leave. He had been kept awake
by some horses running around his
premises and had driven them away
once, and going back to bed had not
yet gone to sleep. Mrs. Engle also
heard the explosion and called to her
husband and asked who was shooting,
but Mr. Engle did not think it a shot
and so informed her. He says it
sounded just like an explosion caused
by the bursting of a tire when a blow
out occurs and that he hears the blow
out so often that it did not cause him
to suspicion anything else.
The cracksters must have left their
auto in front of the freight warehouse
on the opposite side of the street, as
the tracks were plain there Tuesday
morning and could be seen distinctly
in the frost on the grass after the
burglary had been discovered. The
only clue is the tires on the auto and
word has been sent to surrounding
towns to keep a lookout for same.
The safe cracking was discovered by
Frank Menager, one of the partners,
when he opened the store Tuesday
morning. A customer took up his at
tention at first but when he passed
back to the rear of the store he was
thunderstruck to find the door of the
safe lying on the floor with books,
checks, etc., scattered all about. The
checks were all left, and also three
chisels, two braces and some dynamite
with two fuses with caps attached.
The work looks like that of amateurs,
especially when the tools left are con
siered.
STAMPEDE BIGGER AND
BETTER THAN LAST YEAR
The Missoula Stampede is to be big
ger and better than last year. Many
of the large number of spectators who
witnessed last year's show will be
skeptical in regard to this statement.
It appears, however, as if this will be
just the case. From every direction
are coming inquiries as to the prizes
and purses to be distributed this year.
Sufficient contracts are already in the
hands of the secretary to make it cer
tain that Western Montana will see
the greatest array of wild west talent
ever collected at the Stampede this
year.
Last year's celebration was con
sidered remarkable for the varied
amusement which was offered those at
tending the big, event. This year a
committee of the chamber of commerce
is planning to furnish amusement for
the guests of the city as it has before.
There will be band concerts, ball
I games, baloon ascensions with four or
more drops, wild west parades, fire
works, rifle tournament and other
events calculated to keep the visitor
on his toes all the time. The dates for
the Stampede this year are July 1, 2,
3 and 4.
REPUBLICAN CONVENTION
WILL RUN INTO NEXT WEEK
From present indications the
Republican national convention
now in session at Chicago will
run into next week before a
nomination is made.
According to latest news from
Washington, the entire effort at
present is being concentrated to
ward affecting a compromise
with the Progressives, also in
convention in Chicago. For some'
time it looked like there would
be nothing doing in this line, but
late information is that another
effort will be made with strong
hopes of success.
Theodore Roosevelt has con
sented to address the Republican
INDIANS ASK FOR
TRIBAL MONEY
The Indians on the Flathead reser
vation who have been granted patents
in fee for their allotments, want a di
vision of the tribal funds and a dis
tribution of the money. They argue
that by issuing them their patents for
their land and the subsequent granting
of citizenship, they should be entirely
separated from their old affiliations
and given their share of the tribal
money held by the government.
In support of this contention a meet
ing was held at the Dixon agency last
Thursday, at which tjme a committee
was appointed to gohitit signatures 'to a
petition asking for this action. The
committee has issued the following ad
dress and ask that all interested pre
sent themselves and sign the petition:
Flathead Indian Reservation, Montana,
June 1, 1916.
To the Honorable, The Secretary of
the Interior, Washington, D. C.
We, the undersigned, members of
the Flathead Indian Reservation, Mon
tana, all of whom have been granted
patents in fee to our allotments, here
by respectfully petition that the pro
rata shares in any tribal moneys be
longing to the Flathead Indians be
paid to those members of the Flathead
Indian Reservation to whom patents in
fee have been issued; and in the event
that any Indians to whom patents in
fee have been issued be deceased, that
the shares of such deceased Indians be
paid to their heirs. We also request
that where any Indian to whom patent
in fee has been issued may be an heir
of a deceased Indian that the share of
such deceased Indian be paid to the
heir who has received patent in fee.
Inasmuch as we, by receiving our
patents in fee, are citizens of the
United States, we desire to receive, at
the very earliest date possible, the en
tire share to which we may be entitled
from any funds that may accrue to the
credit of the Flathead Indians; and as
these tribal funds are derived from the
sale of tribal timber, lands and other
tribal property, we hereby respectfully
petition that legislation be enacted
providing for the payment to the tribal
fund by the government of the ap
praised value of the tribal timber,
lands and other tribal property, This
would permit the payment to us of the
entire sum to which we would be en
titled from the tribal funds, and the
government would be reimbursed for
the timber, lands and other property
the same were disposed of by the
government.
Respectfully submitted,

KILL THE WIREWORMS
BY GOOD FARMING
--J. R. Campbell, in the Missoulian.
A few farmers on the reservation
have asked me about the control of the
convention if the delegates
wished, and an invitation will
probably be extended him to do
so. He has issued a statement
saying that the needs of the
country at this time should be
the incentive to get together and
elect some man who will give the
country an administration such
as will command the respect of
other nations. He says Presi
dent Wilson has failed to do this.
No ballots have been taked and
none seem likely until next week.
It is practically certain that
Roosevelt is eliminated and some
other person will be the nominee,
but who it will be is very un
certain.
ADMIRAL BEATTY.
Led British Fleet Into
Recent North Sea Action.
London, June .--Admiral David
Beatty, commander of the British bat
tle cruiser squadron which opened
the engagement with a (ermuan fileet
in the North sea May :1, is the hero
of the nation. Ileatty, whose daring
attempt to cut off the (lerunan cruiser
division, was frustratel only by the
appearance of Teuton dreadnoughts
in overwhelming force, added fresh
laurels to the fame he won in the
running fight through the North sea
which ended in the destruction of the
German battle cruiser Blucher.
wireworm, which is troubling them.
This can best be answered by quoting
briefly from Farmers' Bulletin No. 725,
which has just been issued. It is en
titled "Wireworms Destructive to Ce
real and Forage Crops," and may be
had by writing to your congressman
at Washington, or directly to the
United States department of agri
culture. Or I can get a copy for you
if you write me.
It seems that there are a good many
different wireworms, but only two that
are troublesome in the west, in the
dry land sections. These are known as
the dry-land wireworm and the inflated
wireworm. (The bulletin gives a very
good picture of the worm, and of the
beetle which is his parent.) The wire
worm lives as a worm for some 214
years, changes to a beetle in the fall,
and the beetle comes out of the ground
the following spring and begins his
career as an egg layer. The worms do
their damage in early spring in the
dry ;land sections, and burrow down
4 to 8 inches in the soil, and rest dur
ing the hot, dry months. At this time
they are most easily killed by plowing
them up to the surface and cultivating.
This is the only successful method of
fighting them known, and it is right in
line with the best farming practices.
It is recommended that the land to
be summer fallowed be disced or har
rowed early in the spring, and often
enough thereafter to keep down weeds
until July or early August, when it
should be plowed and dragged. After
cropping the next year plow the stubble
as soon as the crop is removed. Two
or three years of this treatment will
get rid'of the worms on the farm, and
also increase the acre yield at the same
time.
P. S. ---Poor farmers, who are always
behind time, don't need to fear the
worm.
It is easy to see that Louis Kaiser
of Leon, believes in "preparedness,"
for the condition of his soil proclaims
it to the passerby. Well prepared
land is half the crop and Louis knows
how to get the other half too, by
proper care and cultivation.
C. M. Dall of Horte, is the owner of
a Jersey cow whose milk test for the
past month averaged 6.6 per cent. If
this cow keeps up her milk flow and he
uses a good dairy sire, he has here the
foundation for a very profitable dairy
herd in this one cow.
A reservation farmer who doesn't
speak as good English as some of us,
but who is using his head in the right
way, told me as we were discussing the
cow business, "My creams bring me
damn good board, and the milk keeps
my hogs up." Sounds like good horse
sense to me.
RONAN WINS AT
HOT SPRINGS
Ronan won another game last Sunday
at Hot Springs by a score of 9 to 2, in
a game uninterestieg after the second
inning. Benny Hull pitched a good
game for Ronan, with nine strike-outs
to his credit. Only one Ronan man
struck out in the nine innings. The
outs resulted mostly from infield hats
well fielded and high fly balls. At no
time was the game in danger and the
Ronan team loafed at times or took
chances in base running which they
could not have done had the game
been close.

RONAN WILL HAVE MID
LAND LYCEUM COURSE
Arrangements have been completed
by which Ronan will have the Midland
Lyceum Course the coming winter.
Miss Marian A. May, a representative
of the course, secured enough signa
tures to a contract to insure the en
tertainments being given here, the
first to commence in October.
The first number, which will appear
here in October some time, is the
Croatian Tambourica Orchestra, a
company consisting of six people, all
Croatians, using their native instru
ments. This is said to be one of the
strongest musical numbers this bureau
has ever carried, and is alone worth
the price of a season ticket.
Hon. Grandvile Jones of Texas, who
comes in December, is a humorist
lecturer. His talk, "Feeding on
Husks," is a powerful appeal for bet
ter home conditions for boys. Many a
sham and false pretense is punctured
by this speaker, and his hour and a
half teems with human nature and
humor.
The Pooler-Delts company, the third
number, are musical entertainers. An
evening of story and song. Miss Delts
has been a teacher in the Conservatory
of Music at Drake, and Miss Pooler has
for the past seven years done work for
the Chautauqua Managers' Association,
Mr. Arthur Kachel, the fourth en
tertainer, is an enactor of plays. He
has reached the very top in his profes
sion. His lyceum and chautauqua
work has necessitated his appearance
in some of the greatest centers of cul
ture and education.
The Edna Earl Crum Concert Party,
which finishes the course, consists of
three ladies. Miss Crum is looked
upon by lyceum bureaus as one of the
foremost violinists. She has studied
under German masters and her work is
excellent. Her support, Miss Barney
and Miss Kvello, have both had con
siderable lyceum and chautauqua ex
perience.
RUSSIANS BEGIN
TERRIFIC DRIVE
Assume Offensive Aiainst Tee.
tonic Allies.
London,.June 6.-The long expected
general offensive of Russians against
the Teutonic allies seemingly has be
gun. From both Petrograd and Vien
na come reports that Russians are ac
tively engaged over a front from the
Pripet river, east of Brest-Litovsk, to
the Rumanian frontier-a distance of
about 250 miles.
Russians everywhere are using large
numbers of guns and men and, accord
ing to Petrograd, have achieved suc
cesses on many inmportant sectors,
taking 13,000 prisoners and a number
of guns and destroying or capturipg
Teuton positions.
Along the Bessarabian front, in the
Dniester region, along the ldwer Stri
pa and in Volhynia, - Russian attacks
have been particularly violent. In the
region of Olyka, in the zone of the
Volhynian fortress triangle, Russian
guns heavily have shelled a frant of
more than fifteen miles in length held
by the Austrians.
Around Verdun bad weather has set
in and as a result only bombardments
have taken place. No change in posi
tion are recorded.
Around Vaux and Damloup bom
bardment on both sides has continued
with intensity, while to the west of
the Meuse the shelling has been only
intermittent,
Violent Fighting Near Ypres.
On the remainder of the front in
lrance, except around Ypres, the sit
pation is reported quiet. About
Ypres, however, the flermans and Ca
nadians are continuing the violent
lighting that has been in progress
since last week, when Clermans cap
tured Canadian positions which later
were retaken in hand to hand bomb
ing encounters.
Returning to the attack Sunday the
feirmans again forced the Canadians
to relinquish the bulk of recaptured
ground, but Canadians are disputing
strenuously the efforts of the Teutons
to oust them from the remainder of
the positions.
Vienna reports the Austrians have
made a further advance into Italy in
the Cengio zone near Asiago. The
town of Cesiana and 5100 prisoners,
three cannon and eleven machine
guns and 126 bomb-throwers were cap
tured by Austrians.
Home admits the retirement of the
Italians in the Cengio zone, but says
that in h)algone valley, L.agarisea val
ley and on the Posina front Austrian
attacks were repulsed with heavy loss.
In Southern Albania, in the region
of Aclona, Austrians have dispersed
with their artillery Italian detach
dments operating in that vicinity.
CANADIANS LOSE HEAVILY
Large Number Killed and Wounded at
Ypres.
Ottawa, Out., June 6.-Evidences of
the toll paid by the Canadians in the
recent fighting about Ypres is shown
in the casualties being received at the
militia department. About 700 names
of the rank and file have already been
received.
The list is growing steadily and the
list of officers and men is very large.
More than 100 Canadian officers
were killed or are missing. The list
of officers is headed by General Vic
tor Williams, wounded and missing.
General Mercer also is listed as
wounded and missing.
JAMES H. M'CLURE IS DEAD
Was a Prominent Railway and Bridge
Contractor.
St. Paul, June 6.-Following a slight
indisposition of three weeks' standing
James H. McClure, one of the oldest
ixnd best known railway and bridge
contractors in the Northwest, died
suddenly of heart disease at his home.
Mr. McClure was seventy-four years
old.
In the later seventies Mr. McClure
built the first bridge across the Mis
sissippi river at Anoka, Minn.
For many years he was one of the
heaviest contractors for the Omaha
railroad, putting in scores of bridges
in the Northwest and having in charge
the double tracking of the road from
St. Paul to Chicago.
SUICIDE FOLLOWS FAILURE
Los Angeles, June 6.--Lieutenant
Commander H. C. Van Steyn of the
Dutch naval flying corps, commission
ed to buy aeroplanes in this country
for his government, was found dead
in his gas filled apartment.
A note addressed to his superior,
Captain C. L. Anice Voegelsang, said:
"My mission has been a failure from
begfinning to end."
