The second largest class ever grad­
uated from the Bismarck high school
received its diplomas last night, be­
fore an audience of relatives and
friends that tax«'l the Auditorium.
E. J. Taylor, state superintendent
of public instruction, rn-ented the
sheepskins1 to the thirty-seven gradu­
ates, following an interesting pro­
gram of music and addresses.
Coad Delivers Address.
James E. director of the ex­

Challenge." This is the fit ft. time in

"What can you do'- wa.i the theme
of Mr. Coad's address. Every penny
invested in books was wnsitd unless
1hc books could be translated into ac­
tion, he said. He urged that happi­
ness was not dependent upon circum­
stances and that discontent was some
iitinics a good thing.,, Hi^jwtyU^sa, was*

•Then we had two small grade

Many Improvements.
"Since then a modern high school
has been bulk. People predicted that
it would not be filled for ages, still it
is little too large now.
"Today 235 students are enrolled.
We have, instead of the five or six
wo then had, twelve teachers who
give all of their time to the high
school.
"When I caiie then were nine­
teen teachers in all, now there are
thirty-five.
Will Retain Interest.
"We
have added several depart
ments: the ones devoted to commer­
cial work and sciences are worthy of
special mention.
•"My interest in Bismarck schools
will not cease with my departure. I
hope that they will even progress
more in the next six years than they
have in the past six. And I hope that
Bismarck will be the first city of
-North Dakota in the near future, as
so many have predicted."
Boys Show Increase,
Mr. Root reminded the graduating
class that diplomas were not life in­
surance policies that they alone
would not insure success.
He also told of the increase in per­
centage of boys in the graduating
class. They were 17 percent in the
first class graduated under the pres­
ent superintendent and 40 percent in
last night's class.
Glee Clubs Applauded.
Mr. Taylor, whose remarks were
brief, urged every graduate to go on
to higher institutions of learning, but
*o remember if they could not that
their education was not finished. Life
is, education.
Both the boys and the girls glee
clubs were enthusiastically received
and forced to respond to encores.
Rev. J. R. Hughes gave the invo­
cation.
The boys wore a red Russel rose,
the class flower, in their lapels and
the girls carried bouquets.

The exercises closed with the sing­
ing of the class song:
We leave our wisdom to the Juniors,
And to the Sophomores our winning
ways,
And to the Freshmen, a good example.
To follow through their high-school
days
We love you, dear old Bismarck High
School,
'Tis with a sigh that we must part,
You've held our hopes and joys,
Our tears and fears,

To "Sixteen." three long cheers.'

Wheat Crop
Washington, June 8.—Present indi­
cations point to a wheat crop of 300,
000,000 bushels smaller this year than
last year. Department of agriculture
forecast today indicated a winter
wheat crop of 469,000,000 bushels,
30,000,000 bushels less than forecast
from jyiay 1 condition, and a spring
wheat crop of 246,000,000 bushels, due
to a decrease of 8 percent in the
acreage from last year, and to the late
wet spring.
Crop conditions of June 1 indicated
less production than last year of
small grain crops, but they promised
to be about te same as the average
production for the last five years.
Indications are that the oats crop
will be about 300,000,000 smaller than
last year.

Germans Are Active-
Considerable activity has been
shown by the Germans against the
Russians in the northern section of
the Russian fronts, where the Ger­
man guns have bombarded the lines
along the Dvina to the lake region
south of Dvinsk, and thrown infantry
attacks against the Russian positions
south of Smorgon.
With the capture of Fort Vaux,
northeast of Verdun, the Germans
have attempted to advance their lines
against the French east and west of
the Thiaumont farm, south of Douau
monit. The French barrier fire, how­
ever, iheld them back northwest of
Verdun, around Hill 304, and in the
region of Chattancourt, the artillery
duels are still intense.
The Italians, to the soutih and south­
east of Trent, continue to keep the
Austrians from further advances.
South and southwest of Arsiero, at­
tacks by the Austrians against Italian
positions, were entirely repulsed, ac­
cording to Rome, while along the La
garina valley, concentrations of Aus­
trians were dispersed by the Italian
batteries.
Northwest of Trent, in. the Ortler
region, the Italians have attacked and
captured several points of vantage
from the Austrians and further south
in the Ohiese valley, have repulsed
Austrian offensives.
Although it had been believed that
the entire ship company of the cruis­

fection for Miss Lambert and his be­

was on his way to Miss Lambert, and
by leaving letters to be mailed after
his departure from Madison, Wis.

Chicago, June 8.—Woman's suffrage
ran a curious course today in the Re­
publican convention. First denied a
place in the platform, then accepted
as a party plank, without reservation,
it. finally found its resting place in
the Republican resolutions as a favor­
ed proposition in principle, but with
the provision that, each state should
settle ilie woman's suffrage question
for ilsclf. The plank offered by the
newly formed woman's party, which
would have pledged the party to the
so-called Susan B. Anthony amend­
ment, was rejected. The plank adopt­
ed conforms more nearly to requests
made in resolutions by the National
American Woman's Suffrage Assoeia
tion. As incorporated in the plat­
form, it reads
Suffrage Plank?
"The Republican party, reaffirming
its fiiith in KovernnieiTt of t.he people,
by. tli people, and for the people, as
a measure of justice to one-half of
the adult people of this country, fav­
ors the extension of suffrage to wo­
men, b.ut recognizes ,the right of
.eicU. sijate to settle this question for
itself."
Dizzy Moment.
The pendulum swung first one way
and then another, gloom or jubilation
reigned in the ranks of the women,
who carried their plea to the conven­
tion yesterday.
The liisl decision that five of tho
subcommittee of the Republican reso­
lutions coniuiitl.ee had voted against
the recognition of women's suffrage
in the platform, and four had favored
it, came early in the day. There was
a hurried marshaling of the friends of
suffrage, and three hours later the
resolutions committee as a whole
voted -(i to 21 in favor of recognizing
the principle of woman's suffrage.
The joy was short-lived, for within
half an hour, word came that the roll

there were some cheers.
Chicago, June 8.—The progressive
national convention met in two tu­
multuous sessions today and adjourn­
ed tonight until 11:00 a. m. tomorrow.
The principal business of the day was
the approval of a proposition to con­
fer on peace plans with the republi­
can convention.
The leaders kept control over the
delegations more by persuasion and
•by constant reiteration of Chairman
Robbins that a majority would decide
any question that arose than by any
actual hold they had upon the dele­
gations. There was the same deter­
mination to nominate TheocUire
Roosevelt from the time the first dele­
gation trooped in shortly after 1
o'clock until the last went out, short­
ly before 9 o'clock tonight.

The conference committees of the progressive and re-

nounced that they would not meet again until after sea-'
sions today of the two conventions. The only statement
they would make was:
"We report progress."
The conference was harmonious. When the discus-.
sion of candidates came up, the only man named by
the progressive committee was Colonel Roosevelt, while
thfe republicans suggested various favorite sons,-Pair
jm
buiks, Hughes, Root, and others.
Oyster Bay, June 8.—Colonel Roobevelt still main-,
tains the position that nothing has developed in the sit

there were no indications tonight that he was making

ceived as usual at Sagamore Hill by the Colonel He en

The conference committees appoint­
ed by the republican and progressive
national conventions to discuss har­
mony held their first meeting tonight.
What will come of the meeting can
be only conjectured. The republican
committee is composed of men regard­
ed as opposed to the nomination of
Col. Roosevelt, but not opposed to
the elimination of Justice Hughes.
The progressive conferees are gener­
ally regarded as men who will insist
on the Colonel's nomination,
New Uncertainty.
I'he acceptance by both conventions
of the peace conference proposal
threw the situation into a new uncer­
tainty. Hughes' supporters and
other republican leaders feel it can­
not prevent the nomination of the
justice, but the development has had
the effect of holding off the expected
crystalization upon Justice Hughes in
the republican convention.
The progressive convention reas­
sembles tomorrow morning at 10
o'clock, and the republican conven­
tion at 2 o'clock.
Those who were confident that
some harmonious action would come
of the peace conferences pointed ogt
that the progressives, are in the posi­
tion of having as yet adopted no plat­
form and that there was more than
a possibility that if the conferees can
reach an .agreement, the republicans
will meet the situation by Uking some
of the progressive planks into theif
own platform.
Some of the progressive leaders
professed to have wort from outside
of the republican convention that this
would be done.
Ready to Proceed.
Chairman Harding of the repubU*
can convention said tonight that Un­
less he is overruled, he will ask the
conventioh to go straight throat
with the nomination as soon as the
convention convenes tomorrow and
that all seconding speeches 'he mad#
after the nominating speeches hare
been concluded, and then by arrang*
ment with the chair. About the OBly
thing that can interfere with the Pffr*

ing speeches. Seconding speechea
will be limited to five minutes each.
