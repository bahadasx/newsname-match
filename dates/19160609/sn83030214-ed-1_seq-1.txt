COLONEL BARS
HUGHES INLAST
WORD TO G.O.P.
Justice Regarded as
Candidateof German
Americans.
THIRD TICKET
MORE MENACING
Roosevelt Silent on Topic,
But Oyster Bay Expects
Finish Fight.
[F"--* a S'alT Cnrrmprrndtni of Tha Tnhur. I
I'yster Hay, N. V., June ft. Colonel
Roosevelt is standing pat to-night on
the message he sent to (hicago to-day
in answer to the invitation of William
P. Jacksnn, national committeeman
from M.-iryland, to go to the convention
city. Jle is not yet ready to go to
(hicago. and up to this time feels he
4vill not ha4> to go. While he has de
cllafld COaaiatflatl*' to indicate his atti
tude toward Hughes, should the latter
be nominated by the Republieans, it is
beheved here that he would head a
third ticket against the justice.
The statement to Mr. Jarkson is re?
garded here as Colonel Roosevelt's
ultimatum to the Republiean conven?
tion in two important particulars:
First, that he has served notice
that the (Jerman-Americans. so called,
are endeavoring to dominate the IOB*
vcntion and that body must free itself
from this influence and stand squarely
fnr straight Americanism or lose the
chance for party harmony.
Secondly, that Justice Hughes is
the candidate of the (Jerman-Ameri
eafl Alliance, openly made so hy that
organization's declarations, and there?
fore the Colonel and his party eould
not support him if he were nominated.
Third Ticket More Menacing.
In other words, tho danger of a third
ticket looms more menacing at this
stage of the proceedings in Chicago
than it has at any previous time. The
impression is strong that the only rea
? lonel Roosevelt has not yet IX*
prtBitd hlBiaclf emphatically on the
Hughfll QBflflt.Ofl is that he feels that
that point in the situation has not yet
been irached.
In All event?, it would appear that
the quickest solution of the situation,
Al fai as Justice Hughfll is eoncerned,
tn brlag about a united front against
Wilson lies only ifl the possibility of a
frank deelaration from Hughes da*
neuacing thfl effort of the German
Ameriean Alliance to make him it
didate and a cnmprt ht -n-i. a statement
h- to where he stands on the big
of Americanism and preparcdne|i M

POINTS IN ROOSEVELT'S HARMONY
ULTIMATUM TO REPUBLICANS
I can only say that the matter lies with the Repub?
lican convention, and that if the convention desires me
to address it I shall he glad to do so.
President Wilson, however amiable his intentions, has
rendered to this people the most evil service that can be
rrruu'red to a great democracy by its chosen leader.
The professional German-Americans are seeking to
terrorize your convention, for they wish to elect next
November a man who shall not be in good faith an Ameri?
can President, but the viceroy of a foreign government.
It is for your convention in emphatic fashion to repudiate
them.
Can we not, forgetting past differences, now join, for
the safety and honor of our country, to enforce the poli
cies of genuine Amerieanism and genuine preparedness?

the platform adopted almost unanim
ou-ly by the Republiean National Con?

by the delegates wi'h approral. It is
one on which all members of the party
can stand.
There is a ?triking similarity be?
tween the Republiean and Progressive
plstfanaa on almost ail the main
is-ues. While the language differs. the
sentiment expres.-aed is the same.
.in woman suffrage, however, the Re?

Progressive:. The former favor the

derlare it ii a question for each state

The plank on preparedness is one of

calls for fleets sufficient to protect both |

Suffrage Resolution
Adopted by G. 0. P.,
35 to 11.
[Kr.im a StaiT CV>rrwpon.l*ot of Tha Trtburm.l
Chicago, June 8. The Republiean
and Progressive National Conventions
adopted woman suffrage planks in their
platform* to-day. The Republiean
j plank favors action by each State, while
. th? Progreseive deelaration deraand.i
j both State and Federal action.
The Bull Moose advocates of equal
' francnise earried everything before
| them by a unanimous vote, but the aaf*
' frage resolution was only passed in the
Republiean convention after a atiff
fight. Early in the day the sub-com
mlttee of the Resolutiona Committee
rejected the plank by a vote of 5 to 4.
The advocates of suffrage rallied to
the fight then. and three hours lat-r
the Resolution* Committee as a whole
voted L'6 to 21 ln favor of recognizing
woman suffrage.
Within half an hour, however. defeat
was threatened again. when it was re?
ported that seven absent committeemen
were preparing to ask for a reconsid
eratlor. of the favorablo action. After
repeated parleys the deelaration was
reconsidered and emerged as the last
plank of the platform. The final vote
was 35 to II.
In the sub-eommittee those oppo.ing
votes for women were Senator-" I.odge.
Wadsworth and Oliver, Charles Hop
hlai Clark and ex-Repre?entative How
land, of Ohio. Those who favored the
plea for recognition were Senator*
Borah, Sutherland and Kall and Repre
sentative Madden, of lllinois. In the
full committee Senator Borah was the
leader fnr the women's plea, and Sen?
ator Smoot took a prominent part in
the negotiations for an agreement,
which led to the final action.
Borah Saven Plank.
( redit for prevent ing flat rejeetin.-,
of the plank on reconsideration by tha
committee was g'ven to '-'enator Borah,
* ho declared that the question would
be taken to the floor of the convention
if the committee vote were ovarndden.
This stand, it was declared, forced a
stay of the movement to overturn th* :
recognition. and the modification rec
ogniiing the right of the irdividual
states to decide on the franchise with?
in their border* was evolved.
The reading of the plank by Senator
I.odge in the Colneum brought fortii
h storm of appiause from the delegatei
representing suffrage states, which waa
quickly followed by a demonstration
from the antl-?uffragi*ts in the con?
vention. The plank reads:
"The Republiean party, reaflirming
its faith in government of the people,
by the people and for the people, aa a
meaaure of justice to one-half the adult
people of thi* country, favors the ex
tens.on of the suffrage to women, bu*.
recogniies the right of each ?tate tj

The suffrage plank, aa read by Will?

convention, declared at tirst for "eitht r
Kederal or state action.-' Through th?
effort* of Mrs. Abbv Scntt Baker, of

to "both Federal and state action."

TO-DAY, HILLES DECLARES
Both Conventions Adopt Platforms and
Clear the Decks for To-day's
Battle of Ballots.
fFrom a Staff Correspondent of The Tribune.]
Chicago, June 9 (12.36 A. M.)?The conference has ad
journed to meet to-night, half an hour after the Republican
convention adjourns, after the conferrees have reported to their
conventions.
The conferrees were unanimous in asserting that the con*
ference was entirely harmonious. Discussion of candidates fol?
lowed just two lines: the Progressives talked only about (olonel
Koosevelt; the Republican conferrees suggested the names of
various favorite sons, including Fairbanks, Burton, Root,
Hughes and others. but reaehed no unanimous decision that they
favored any one of them above the other. The entire range of
discussion, it was said, never got beyond generalities.
REPUBLICANS MORE OPTIMISTIC.
While both sides reported "progress" the Republicans ap
peared to take a more optimistlc view of the situation than some
of the Progressives, among whom ihere was far from a unanim
ity of opinion that an agreement was probable.
It was agreed that the conferrees should report to their
respective conventions in the morning. Neither side was at
all sure that the convention which it represented eould be con
trolled. It was understood that three ballots would bo taken
in the Republican convention, and if without result there
should be a further conference to-night. If. however. as might
very likely be the ease, either or both conventions should mako
a nomination to-day, all further negotiations would be im
possible.
Early in the evening there was a report that the ProgTM
sive conferrees had offered the names of Senator Lodge of
.Massaehusetts, and (ienerals Goethals and I.oonard W'ood as
acceptable to them. but this proved to be untrue. No such sug?
gestion was made.
