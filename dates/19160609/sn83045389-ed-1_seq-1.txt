PA KIP. .Tune 8.?The fate of Fort
\?ux, upon which the Germans have
centered eiTorts for three days, remains
i?< suspense, according to the latest re
ports to the French W;ir Otllce. Its
less would he regretted by France, on
iM-coiint of the moral effect, and for the
sake of the garrison who struggled so
gallantly amidst its shell-swept ruins,
but military critics assert that its pos
K-sslon would be of mtle henertt to
the enemy.
The fort has long since been dis
mantled, and is regarded by tho French
command as merely of value as an ob
servation post. It is asserted that its
occupation will not help the Germans
to take Verdun any more than their
capture of Fort Douaumont. which they
held for three months without being
able to make a step forward.
ft Behind Fort Vaux the. enemy Is con
fronted by an exceptionally strong
Inner line, to the defense of which
both nature and military art have
I-' iven their greatest aid. This Jlne in
cludes the positions of Frolde Terre
and the heights of Souvllle and
Tavnnnes, which are crowned with
torts. Vaux forms an advance work,
whleh supplements the defense of Sou
ville Fort, and was constructed with
a view of sweeping tho ravines which
it commands.
As Vaux is the furthest point from
ihe River Meuso of the, Verdun de
f.-nses, it Is less affected by the flank
ing firo from the French batteries west
of the river than other positions. This
explains why the Hermans chose it as
the point through which to make a
determined effort to force a M ay to the
in.ier lines of the Verdun forts, not
withstanding that by tho conformation
of the ground It was tho most difficult
to attack in the. whole region. I

S. Forbes by dedication the necessary
land and casements, tn>? Common Coun
cil. in special session, last night re
moved all obstacles for the early open
ing and extension of Monument Ave
nue and other West End streets. With
the agreement practically reached with
the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Po
tomac Railroad for the opening of B
Street, from Broad .Street to Park Ave
nue, there remains nothing to block
the long-sought improvement.
Councilman Sea ton, in movinc that
the papers in the Forbes matter be
taken from the table, explained that
the agreement with Mr. Forbes had
been reached by the Finance Commit
tee after two conferences, and that
he felt positive that the Council could
do no harm in taking up the project,
at this time, as all details had been
practically completed.
"The final detail In the general plan,"
said Mr. Scaton, "will be completed in
the next few days, and that Is for the
opening of i> Street, from Broad Street
to Monument Avenue. Representative.*
of the Richmond, Fredericksburg and
Potomac Bailroad Company held a con
ference this afternoon with City At
torney Pollard in his office, and it was
stated that President William H. White
would recommend to the road's board
of directors the dedication of the neces

should open this street, for which ho
had agreed to give a strip through his

the railroad and west of the Hoscneath
Road There Is In my mind no ques
tion but. what the board of directors of
the railroad will act favorah/y on the
recommendations made to It by Presi
dent White.
"Under the agreement with Mr.
Forbes the city acquires 1,462 feet for
the opening of Monument Avenue at a
uniform width of 140 feet, the samej
width as the street to the east, about
900 feet on Franklin Street and Rose

He also gives the city the required

CHICAGO, Junft S.?The Republican |
convention to-day .accepted the invita- 1
lion of the Progressive convention to
a conference for harmony. A proposal i
to that end, adopted first in the Pro
gressive convention, was received in
the Republican convention and adopted
with a few scattering "noes."
.Senator Reed Smoot, of Utah; Sena - ;
tor William K. Borah, of Idaho; former
Senator \V. Murray Crane, of Massa- j
chusetts; Nicholas Murray Butler, of
the New York delegation, and former '
Representative A. R. Johnson, of lion-!
ton. Ohio, were appointed as the Re- j
publican conferees. They at once he- j
?;an arrangements for meeting the Pro- ?
gressives.
The complexion of the committee was
generally regarded as one that would I
no* accept Colonel Roosevelt for the
presidential nomination, hut would not
insist upon Justice. Hughes. The whole
effect of the development was to throw
the Republican nomination into uncer
tainty. t
The other principal developments in
the republican convention were the
adoption of the platform, as reported .
'?>* the resolutions committee headed
l>y Senator I^odKe; a half-minuto dem
onstration for Colonel Roosevelt when |
iiia name was mentioned; (ho perfec- j

policy inaugurated by McKinley and
continued by Roosevelt. The denton
rtrailc.n was principally in the gal
leries, although it was Joined by some
delegates. Senator Lodge smiled and
waited, and it subsided In less than a|
minute.
The outstanding incident of the day's
session came with Senator Lodge's an- >
nouncement of the woman suffrage j
plank.
"The Republican party, reaffirming
its faith in government of the people
by the people nnd for the people, rss
a measure of Justice to one-half the
adult people of this country, ?favors
the extension of suffrage to women." |

while the suffragists began their dem
ons! ration.
"But," continued Senator I.odge,'
when the noise subsided, "it recognizes'
the right of each State to settle this
question for itself."
There were roars of lou>?htcr at this
qualifying phrase, and the convention
hall rang with the demonstration of
those who approved the qualification
The temper <>f the convention man
agers to hear the minorities might well
be illustrated by their conduct toward
Edwin J- C.ross, of Milwaukee, who, as
a member .of the resolutions committee,
presented his own minority report con*

ing from governmental manufacture of
munitions to the initiative, the referen-|
dum and the recall.

Impatient delegates tried to howl him
down, hut he was protected by Chair
man Harding, who insisted that he
should be heard. A chorus of "noes"
disposed of his report.
With that the convention referred
contests in the national committee to?
the national committee itself, ratified
the uncontested nominations and ad
journed until to-morrow.
Chairman Harding said to-night that
lie will a.slc the convention to go
straight through with the nominating
speeches as soon as the convention'
convenes to-morrow, and that all sec
onding speeches be made after the
nominating addresses have been con
cluded, and then only by arrangement
with the chair.
About the only thing that can In
terfere with this program, he. said,
would be a report from the peace con
ference committee. There will be no
time limit placed on nominating
speeches. Seconding speeches will be
limited to live minutes each.

ing as permanent chairman.
As the cheering swelled louder, the]
delegates sprang to their feet, and i
repeated whacks of the gavel only In- I
creased the uproar. When quiet was j
restored Chairman Harding thanked j
the delegates, but said it had been '
agreed that if he was to he chairman
he ?'should mak9 no speech." i
.V^ter being in session about two
hours, during which time it did noth- ;
ing more than perfect its permanent
organization and listen to several !
speeches, the convention at 1:31 o'clock
adjourned until 4 o'clock to await the
report of the resolutions committee.
While marking time in the hope that |
the committee would be able to make j
an early report, the convention lis-j
tened to characteristic speeches by
Chauncey M. Depew, "L'ncle Joe" Can- ,
non and Senator Horah.
"There is one thing I cannot under- !
stand," said Mr. Depew, " and that Is.
a pacifist. As I understand the pad- :
fist's argument, if, by any chance, "00.

would ineet them and drive the^i b'aek.
"When this Avar closes there will be

AUDITORIUM HALL, CHICAGO, .Tune
S.?The Progressive National Conven
tion met in two tumultuous sessions
to-day, and adjourned to-night until
10 o'clock to-morrow morning.
The principal business of the day
was the approval of 11 plan to confer
mi peace plans with the Republican
co mention.
Throughout tho day the leaders
kept control over the delegates more
by persuasion and by constant reitera
tion of Chairman Roblns's promise
thai the majority would decide any
questions that arose, than by any actual
hold they had upon the' delegates.
The same determination to nominate
Theodore Roosevelt was evident from
the time the first man trooped in.
sh.irtly after 1 o'clock, until the last
went out, shortly before 3 o'clock to
night.
benders' made no effort to conceal
their belief that a failure of the con
t*? reneo committee to agree or to find
some possible basis for an agreement
could result, in but one thing?the im
mediate nomination of Colonel Roose

Robins, "to-morrow probably will he

Only by many promises to place no

results from the conferees. The Pro
gressive confciecs appointed by Chair
man Robins are George \V. Perkins,
Governor llirnm Johnson, Horace Wil

M. I'arker.
The convention spent about fo'ir
hours in session, ending with a per
functory night gathering which re
sulted mostly in singing and cheering.

i*:i:iization was made permanent and
the platform of the resolutions com

The motion to appoint a conference

but a tumultuous scene, during whleh
Victor Murdock Insisted that "we

In presenting his motion, Mr Gar
field said:
"During the past twenty-four hours

Monn OPTIMISTIC
While both sides reporteil "progress/'
, the Republicans appeared to fake a
more.optimistic view of the situation
than soma of the Progressives, among
i whom there was far from a unanimity
j of opinion that an agreement was prob
I able.
It was agreed that the conferees
should report to their respective con
ventions this morning. Neither sida
was at all sure that the convention
which Is represented could he con
trolled. It was understood that three
ballots would ho taken in the Repub
lican convention, and if witlfout r?
! suit, there should be a further con
ference to-night. If, however, an
i might very likely be the case,
j either, or both, conventions should
, make a nomination to-day, all fur
ther negotiations would be impossible.
A report that the Progressive con
ferees had offered the names of Sena

The Progressives accepted the Re

a downtown club.
The Republican committee is com
i posed of men who are regarded as op
1 posed to the. nomination of Colonel

{elimination of Justice l-lughes.

Tim acceptance of both conventions
of the peace conference thre^v the
. situation into a new uncertainty.
Hughes's supporters and many other
Republican leaders feel that it cannot
prevent the nomination of the Justice,
i t>ui the development has had the
effect of holding off the expected
crystallization upon Justice Hughes In
the Republican convention.
The Progressive convention reassem
bles to-day at 10 o'clock and the Re
