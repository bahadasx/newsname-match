THE STATE BOARD OF CONTROL
TELLS SITUATION AT GRAND
MOUND SCHOOL.
Declaring emphatically that "no girl
has ever been struck or received cor
poral punishment in any form Bince
the opening of this school," the state
board of control gate out a statement
this week concerning the manage
ment of the state school for girls at
Grand Mound, refuting the charge
that a petition signed by 60 Grand
Mound residents had recently been
presented and Ignored, and announc
ing that It had been compelled to em
ploy a night watchman and had
"given orders to shoot, if necessary,
any night prowlers about the school."
The statement follows the recent
trial of H. H. Batch on a charge of
having aided a girl to escape from
the institution and of offering to as
sist others to escape, to which he
proved an alibi and was acquitted,
and the publication of a story in the
Beattle and Tacoma papers Sunday,
sent out of Centralia to the effect that
SO residents of Grand Mound had re
cently forwarded a petition to the
•tate board of control asking that
charges of cruelty to the Inmates of
the training school be investigated,
and that, according to E. C. Deno, a
resident of the community, the peti
tion had been ignored by the board-
The statement issued by the board
•ays:
Presented Months Ago.
"It is true that such a petition was
presented to the board, but It was a
year and a half ago, or one month
•fter the school had opened and not
recently, as stated in the article. It
to charged that an employe at the
school had made a statement that
three girls had been whipped for hav
ing run away, and Mr. Deno imme
diately circulated a petition asking
for an investigation. At the time Mr.
Deno also visited the school and was
told by one of the girls that the state
ment was not true and that no girl
had ever been whipped at the school.
He did not see the other two girls for
the reason that they were confined to
their rooms, but he was told that any
of the ladies who signed the petition
eould come and examine them.
"No girl has ever been struck or
received corporal punishment in any
form since the opening of this school,
and there is not anyone who has any
knowledge at all of the school but
who knows this to be a fact. Corpo
ral punishment Is prohibited at this
institution and it is a libel upon the
superintendent and the lady employes
for anyone to make such a statement.
Employ Night Watchman.
"The board of control has never
elalmed that the cltisena of Grand
Mound are antagonistic towards the
school, and we do not believe that
they are, but there are certain men
la the neighborhood who have been
bothering the school after nightfall
by peeping in the windows, and in
the day time by loitering near the
achool and endeavoring to entice the
girls, knowing that no man was em-
Ployed at the institution, and we have
been compelled recently to employ a
■an nlghtwatchman and have given
orders to shoot. If necessary, any
Bight prowlers about the school, and
the board will prosecute to the fullest
extent of the law theee men who habg
about the institution for purposes that
can easily be imagined."

TO START PAVING EIGHTEENTH
Court H«)'N Mayor MUM Sign Contract
Work on the improvement of
i Eighteenth street will be undertaken
immediately by the Washington Pav
ing company, Superior Judge Wright
having given a decision Tuesday that
the signing of the contract by the
mayor is a clerical function to indi
cate its genuineness and not a dis
certionary matter, following trial
Monday of the suit brought by the
company to compel Mayor Mottman
to sign the contract.
The decision ends a controversy
over this improvement that has been
carried on between the mayor and
council since last fall, which resulted
in the mayor's announcement when
the council recently awarded the
paving contract that he would not
sign the document until compelled to
do so by the courts. Mayor Mott

the arguments in the case were made
Monday.
STATE GRANGE IN
SESSIOR IRIS WEEK
KEGLEY'S ADDRESS FEATURE OF
OPENING DAY—SCORES REF
ERENDUM BILLS.
Re-emphasizing the Orange's ap
proval of temperance and Roman's
suffrage and declaring that the state
wide prohibition law has been a suc
cess, C. B. Kegley, master of the
Washington State Grange, in his an
nual address at the opening of its
twenty-eighth annual convention at
Burlington Tuesday, vigorously op
posed a state bond issue for roads,
advocated a land tax—the single tax
system—urged the publication of uni
form textbooks by the state, scored,
the referendum laws passed by the
last legislature and advocated aboli
tion of the present bi-cameral legisla
ture and the establishment of a legis
lative commission of 15, to meet con
tinuously, each to receive 93,000 a
year.
In the course of a lengthy address
he also advocated a government
owned merchant marine, the adop
tion of the budget plan by the
state, greater development of the use
of denatured alcohol as a fuel, and
rural credit and national marketing
legislation, pointed to the greater at
tention being given to the improve
ment of rural schools, approved the
present officials of the Washington
State college and the greater empha
sis they are giving to agricultural ed
ucation, discussed in detail the initia
tive laws proposed by the Joint Leg
islative committee, and bitterly at
tacked the universal registration law
passed by the last legislature, requir
ing farmers to register.
Master Kegley's address was the
feature of the opening day of the con
vention, Tuesday. That evening the
visitlng Grangers were entertained by
the people of Burlington at an elabo
rate banquet, at wblclr Governor
Ernest Lister and President Henry
Stusallo of the University of Wash
ington were the principal speakers-
Today is the last of the four-day ses
sion, the election of officers being the
principal business to be transacted.
Says Prohibition Successful.
Temperance wia the first subject
discussed by Master Kegley, his views
being expressed at the outset in the
assertion: "I make the statement
advisedly, that after Ave months of
careful study of its workings, the rec
ord is a conclusive demonstration
that we were fully warranted in our
efforts in behalf of this great move
ment." And tben, after citing figures
as to Seattle, Tacoma. Spokane and
other cities, be declared, "A review of
the counties will show that within the
first six months of the year under
prohibition the arrests for drunken
ness have not been over one-fourth
what they were when we had the open
saloon," closing- his remarks on tjiis
subject with the declaration that
"Washington Patrons stand for na
tion-wide prohibition and a law that
will be as dry as a Kansas south-
wester."
In his advocacy of the publication
of uniform textbooks by the state, he
said:
"The patrons of our school system
of this state are paying out annually

PLUM STATION OBJECTS
TO DIVIDING DISTRICT
Residents Appeal From Ruling Creat
ing New School at Oftut Lake.
J. F. McCorkle, Andrew A. Nelson
and 17 other residents pf the Plum
Station school district filed a peti
tion with the county auditor Wednes
day, appealing to the county commis
sioners from the ruling recently given
oy County Superintendent O. C. Goat
creating a new school district ai
Offut lake out of portions of the
Plum Station, Oak Grove and Spur
geon Creek districts. No reasons for
the appeal are stated in the petition,
but it will be considered by the com
missioners at their meeting next Mon
day, when a date for a hearing will
probably be set.
Superintendent Goss' ruling was
handed down May 8 and Thursday
was the last day the. Plum Station
residents could file a petition for ap
peal- It followed a hearing on a peti
tion presented by Offut lake residents
asking for a school in their neighbor
hood, and 22 residents of different
parts of that section of the county
participated in the discussion.
Before the Plum Station district
was divided by Superintendent GOBS,
it had a valuation of $392,435, the
largest of any one-room school dis
trict in the county, larger than the
valuation of the Tumwater district
and nearly as large as Tenlno's. It
has been operating under a three
mill levy while the average for the
county is about 10 mills, and now
has a balance of $2,100 in its treas
ury. When divided, it retained a val
uation of more than $260,000, which
Superintendent Goss says would still
permit it to operate under a three
mill levy, while the new Offut lake
district, comprising small portions of
the Oak Grove and Bpurgeon Creek
districts also, has a valuation of
$140,000.

*• Fred Seifke, Who Denies
Ghirgn.
Suit for 910,000 for breach of
promise wia died in the local supe
rior court this week by Miss Daisy
Price of Yelm against Fred Seifke, a
Mason county farmer, who has since
entered a general denial of the
charges and asked for a change of
venue for the trial to be held in
Mason county.
Miss Price alleges in her complaint
that they became engaged about
three years ago, that he gave her an
engagement ring, promised to marry
her and wrote her many endearing
letters, and that she went ahead and
bought her wedding trousseau and
made all preparations for the mar
riage, which was to have taken place
daring the spring of 1915. Seifke
changed his mind, however, she
charges, and has refused" to marry
her, though she says she has been
and still is willing to marry him.
Bhe asks for SIO,OOO damages on
the ground that she has been "sorely
aggrieved and distressed and greatly
humiliated and her reputation in
jured in the community In which she
lives." Her suit, which has been
pending for some months, is being
handled by Attorneys Vance and
Parr A Marts, while Attorneys Troy
A Sturdevant represent Seifke.
A bundle of love letters said to
have been written Mlaa Price by
Selfke will be one of the features of
the trial.

NOMINATIONS DUE TODAY
HI CHIGH6O CONVENTION
Favorite-—Bull Moosen Anxious
for Teddy.
After two day* of formal sessions,
and a week of dickering back and
forth, seesawing from one candidate
to another and ostensibly striving to
"get together," the Republicans and
Progressives in their respective quad
rennial conventions at Chicago are
scheduled to begin nominating their
candidates today, and all the "dope*
forthcoming from the conventions In
dicates that Hughes will doubtless be
the Republican nominee and that be
will be unsatisfactory to the Progres
sives, who will nominate Roosevelt.
The chances for the gatherings to
end in the same kind of a row as In
1912 seem excellent.
Will Hughes accept, particularly if
there Is a third ticket In the field?
Will Roosevelt accept the Bull Moose
nomination If Hughes is named by
the Republicans? These are but two
of the many queries pestering the
delegates and the dopesters, but they
all agree on at least two things—
that the Republicans will not nomi
nate Roosevelt and that the nomina
tion of two separate tickets in Chi
cago means the re-election of Presi
dent Wilson hands down.
Haghes has remained quietly at
his work in Washington, his only
statement being a repudiation of pre
convention efforts In hi* behalf;
Roosevelt is sojourning at the Oyster
Bay end of a |7OO-per-day private
telephone line from Chicago and also
keeping mum, up to date. But the
Progressive convention, when it
opened Wednesday, went wild for
Roosevelt. "We want Teddy" was
the chant of the delegates, and the
chairmen of the state delegations
were "sitting on lids" that threat
ened to break loose any minute in a
hurry-up nomination of Teddy by the
radical Progressives.

SHIRE COST OF MR
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MAKES
COUNTER-PROPOSAL TO
GRANGE OFFICERS.
Representatives of the Chamber of
Commerce will meet with the execu
tive committee of the Thurston Coun
ty Pomona Grange in this city next
Saturday, to submit the proposal
adopted by the Chamber trustees
Monday upon the recommendation of
the Agricultural Bureau, that the
financial responsibility for the second
annual Thurston County Fair be as
sumed jointly by the Pomona Grange
and the Chamber of Commerce, and
that a manager be employed to con
duct the Fair.
Inasmuch as a representative of
one of the subordinate Granges who
attended the Bureau's regular meet
ing last Friday night expressed the
opinion, during the discussion of the
Fair situation, that the Granges
"would do their part like they did
last year," it is believed that the pro
posal of the Chamber of Commerce
that the financial responsibility be
assumed jointly will be accepted by
the Pomona Grange executive com
mittee.
Burma Considers Situation.
The Fair situation was the princi
pal topic discussed at the meeting of
the Agricultural Bureau, Chairman
F. R. Klumb of the county fair com
mittee reporting on a recent meeting
with the Pomona Grange executive
committee, lifter the commit
tee issued a statement that, providing
the Carlyon grounds can be obtained
for a reasonable sum, a manager em
ployed and the finances arranged for,
it would go ahead with this year's ex
hibit, but that the members of the
committee declined to assume all of
the financial responsibility-
Some IB members of the Bureau
attended its meeting and the unan
imous opinion was that the Orange
officials should not shoulder all of
the financial responsibility. After an
interested discussion P. J. O'Brien
moved that the Bureau recommend
to the Chamber trustees that the
Chamber assume half of the finan
cial responsibility and the Fair be put
on this year, providing a manager
can be obtained, as is thought likely.
The motion earried and the recom
mendation was endorsed the follow
ing Monday by the trustees.
Chairman C. C. Aspinwall presided
at the Bureau meeting and welcomed
the first two representatives of the
Oranges of the county, James Stocks
from McLane and George Parse from
South Bay, both of whom took part in
the evening's discussions. Plans for
a tour of various Oranges by a repre
sentative of the Bureau, to explain
its plans and objects, were arrcnged
for, and Chairman Aspinwall an
nounced that the standing commit
tees of the Bureau would not be ap
pointed untii the various farmers' or
ganizations had had an opportunity
to comply with the Bureau's request
to send delegates, so that their repre
sentatives could be placed on these
committees.

DIPLOMAS TO 138 PUPILS OP
COUNTY SCHOOLS.
Diplomas were issued this week bjr
County Superintendent O- C. Ooss to
138 pupils in the different school dis
tricts of the county, the largest num

history, these being those who suc
cessfully passed the eighth grade ex
aminations recently held and are now
entitled to enter high school.
Altogether 493 pupila took the ex
aminations, the largest class in the
county's history, but 156 of these
were seventh graders who took the
test on only two subjects, physiology
and geography, studies which the
school laws permit to be completed
in the seventh grade. Two hundred
pupilß tried for diplomas, 62 falling,
but most of them in only one or two
subjects, upon which they expect to
,p y again in the examinations next
Wednesday and Thursday.
Geographical questions proved the
stumbling block in this examination,
Superintendent Goss said, more pu
pils failing to pass in that subject
than any other. There were nine sub
jects in all. •
