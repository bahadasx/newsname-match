Progressives, While Mention

To Reason. Hughes Boom
All Up In The Air
(By Review Leased' Wire.
CHICAGO, June 8. The con-.,
ference of the Republican and
Progressive parties adjourned at
12:10 a. m. after a two-hour sea
sion with the announcement that
they would not meet again until
after the sessions of the two con
ventions , tomorrow. The only
statemet given out was that "we
report "progress."
CHICAGO. June 8. The conferees
were unanimous in assorting that the
conference was entirely harmonious.
Discussion of candidates followed just
two lines, the Progressives sticking to
Roosevelt the Republican conferees
suggested the names of various can
didates, including il-iibs.nks ,Root,
Hughes and others but reached no
unanimous decision that they favor
ored any one above the other. The
entire range of discussion, it was said,
never sot beyond generalities.
" White both sides represented pror
(tress, jthe Republicans appeared td
t:.!a fr' jiioi-e optimistic view of the
situation .than some of the Progres
sives, among whom there was far
from unanimity of opinion that an
agreement was probable.
It was agreed that the conferees
should report to their respective con
ventions in the morning. , Neither side
was at all sure that the convention
which it represented could be controll
ed. It was understood that three bal
lots would be taken in the Republican
convention , and if without result a
furthnr conference tomorrow would
be held.
Early in the evening there was a
report that the Progressive conferees
had offered the names of Senator
Lodge of Massachusetts and Generals
Goethals and Leonard Wood as ac
ceptable to them but this proved to
be untrue. No such offer was made.
CHICAGO, June S.-r-Committees ap
pointed by the Republican and Pro
gressive conventions to discuss peace
held their first meeting tonight. The
Republicans invited the Progressives
io meet them at a down town club and
the Progressives did so.
What will co"-e of the meeting can
only be conjectured. The Republi
can committee is composed of men
who are regarded as opposed to the
nomination of Colonel Roosevelt but
not to the elimination of Justice
Hughes. The Progressive conferees
are generally regarded as men who
will insist on the Colonel's nomina
tion. The acceptance by both conven
tions of the peace conference proposal
threw the situation into a new uncer
tainty. Hushes supporters and many
other Republican Jeaders feel that it
cannot prevent the nomination of the
iusMce. but the development has had
the effect of holding off the expected
crystalizntion upon Justice Hughes in
the Republican convention.
The Progressive convention will
repssemble tomorrow iorning at 10
o'clock and the Republicans at 11
o'clock. Whatever happens after that
depends on the action of the confer
ees who were still in session at a late
hour tonight.

, Suffragettes' Turndown
(By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO, June 8. The Republican
convention today accepted the invita
tion of the Progressives to a confer
ence for harmony. A proposal to that
end. adopted first in the Progressive
convention, was received in the Repub
lican convention and adopted with a
few scattering "noe" and virtually no
demonstration.
. They at once began arrangements
for meeting the Progressives. The
complexion of the committee was gen-,
erally regarded as one which would
not accept Col. Roosevelt for the pres
idential nomination but on the other
hand would not insist on the nomina
tion of Justice Hughes. The whole ef
fect of the development was to throw
the Republican nomination into uncer
tainty until the conferees report.
CHEERS FOR T. R.
The other principal developments in
the Republican convention were the
adoption of the platform as reported
by the resolution committee headed
by Senator Lodge, a half minute dem
onstration for Col. Roosevelt when his
name was mentioned for the first
time in the convention, the vote of the
permanent organization and adjourn
ment until 11 o'clock tomorrow morn
ing. Senator Lodge mentioned Col.
Roosevelt's name in reading the Phil
ippine plank which declares for the
policy inaugurated by McKinley and
continued by Roosevelt. The demon
stration that followed was principally
in the galleries, although it was joined
by some delegates on the floor. Sena
tor Lodge was identified as a personal
friend of the Colonel and smiled at the
demonstration.
THE SUFFRAGE PLANKT
The outstanding incident of the day

nouncement of the woman suffrage
plank.

Its faith in government of the people

measure of justice to one-half of the

the extension of suffrage to woman.'
read the Senator, while the suffragists
began their demonstration. "But,"
continued Senator Lodge, when the
noise subsided, "it recognizes the
right of each state to settle this ques
tion for Itself."
There were roars of laughter at this
qualifying phrase to what the suflra
gists bad considered a a clear-cut vic
tory and the convention hall rang with
the demonstration of those who ap
proved the qualification.

RUSSIANS MEET
GREAT SUCCESSES
Five Austrian Corps On Eve
Of Retreat; Russ Ar
tillery Reported Deadly
(Rv Review Leaped Wire.)
LONDON. June 9. Special dispatch
es from Petrograd express the belief
that the Russian successes against the
Austrians are far more important than
appears from the official announce
ments. The Daily Telegraphs correspondent
venturesthe assertion that is credited
to a prominent Russian expert that
"all five Austrian armies are on the
eve of a general retreat and that Lem
berg is in greut strategic danger."
On the same authority it is said a
strategic breach one hundred miles
wide has been blown in the Austrian
front Increasing the armies of Genera!
von Bothmer and General von Boehni
Krmoli and part of that of Archduke
Joseph Ferdinand."
According to other despatches the
Russian success is largely due to the
unprecedented use of artillery, sur
passing in intensity any previous ef
forts on either side on an eastern
front. The retreat of many Austrian
trench detachments was completely
cut off by a curtain of shrapnel thru
which it was impossible for any thing
to pass, and the Austrians were thus
compelled to surrender en masse.
The Times estimated the Austrian
losses at 200.000.

iSv Review Leasee Wire.)
CHICAGO, June 8. The Progres
sive national Convention met in two
tumultous sessions today and adjourn
ed tonight until 10 a. m. tomorrow.
The business of the day was the ap
proval of a plan to confer on peace
plans with the Republican convention.
Throuehout the day the leaders kept
control Mver the delegations more by
persuasion and by constant reitera
tion of Chairman Robins promise
that majority would decide any ques
tions that ai'Jse than by any actual
hold they had upon the delegations.
The same determination to nominate
Col. Roosevelt was evident from the
time the first delegation trooped in
shortly after 1 o'clock until the last
went out shortly before nine o'clock
tonight.
Leaders made no effort to conceal
their belief that the failure of the
committees to agree or to find some
possible basis for an agreement could
result in but one thing the immedi
ate nomination of Col. Roosevelt. In
the words of Chairman Robins, "to
mon'jw probably will be a big day in
the convention." Only by promises to
place no obstacles in the way of the
nomination of the Colonel were the
delegates content to adjourn ' and
await results for the conferees.
Much Celebrating.
The convention spent about four
hours in session ending with a per
functory night gathering which re
sulted mostly In singing and cheering.

During the day the temporary or

300,000,000. Fruit Crop Re
ported Good. Oats Also
Fall Short
(Bv Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. June 8. Present
indications point to a wheat crop of
300.000.000 bushels n;aller this year
than that of last year. Department of
agriculture forecasts today indicated
a winter wheat crop of 469.000.000
bushels thirty million bushels less
than forecast from May 1, conditions
due largely to insects in Kansas and
Oklahoma, and a spring wheat crop of
C4S.000.000 bushels due to a decrease
of eight per cent in the area grown
last year and to the late wet spring.
Crip 'conditions on June 1 indicates
less production than last year. But
they promise to be about the same as
the average production for the last
five years. Fruit crops as a whole
are good, the apple crop prospect is
good, especially in the eastern states,
but the peach crop promise is rather
poor.
Indications are that the oats crop
will be about 300,000,000 bushels small
er than last year being practically
poor in most southern states, and in
Oklahoma and central Kansss. wher"
green bues has injured it.

French protectorate at Annam to Pe

Imdyguard of the new president Li
Yuan Hung has assured him of the
fealty of the guxrd.

CHICAGO. June S. - Wjnun suf
; frr.ge ran a curious course today in
the Republican convention. First de
fnied a place in the platform, then ac
cepted as a party plank without reser
! vation. it finally found its resting
place 1:1 ine jveeuuni ii icnuiumiu n-
J a favored protiosition in principle, but
(with the proviso that each state
'should settle the woman suffrage ques
i tion for itself.
j The plank offered by the newly
j formed woman's party, which would
(have pledged the Republican party to
'the so-called Susan B. Anthoay amend
!ment. was rejected. The plank adopt
'ed conforms more nearly to the re-
quests made in resolutions by the na
! tional American Woman Suffrage As
isociation. As incorporated in the
platform the plank reads:
; "The Republican party, re-affirming
. its faith in government of the people
by the people and for the people as a
measure of Justice to one half of the
'ndult people of this country favors

i As the pendulum swung first one
' way and thon another, gloom or jubi

yesterday.
The advance decision that five of
