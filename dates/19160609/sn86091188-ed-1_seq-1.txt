A CÙ . m,Uun,<ation re celved from
tiie Utilities Commission of Idaho ad
dressed to Irr. O. T. Stratton and
Hoy b. Herndon, chairman and see
ratary representing the business men
of Salmon, advises that the commis
Hion Is powerless to act in tue matter
or enforciogari improved train service
over tiie Gilmore and Pittsburg rail
road, which, being an inter-state
road, would be under control of tiie
I-nited Stales Commerce commission.
The Idaho commissoners did not

cluding excessive fares on portions of
tiie railroad in Lemhi county, poor
line leuces, dilapidated cars, etc..ex
cept to *ay that minor complaints as
to the railroad service would be rem
edied voluntarily by the G. and P.
company.
The commission made no reference
to tiie complaint about tiie telephone
service wherein it was sought to
effect a physical connection between
the two lines operating exchanges in
Salmon.
All the same, the railroad service
is not what Salmon is entitled to
have and the business people are in
sistent in their demands for better
service. Just what remedy to apply
as to tiie dual telephone nuisance has
not yet been determined upon hy the
a long-suffering public.

BUSINESS BOOM IS
TO BE ENDURING
It is admitted frankly by everyone
that great prosperity has come to the
Gutted States. Evea ti.e opposition
party, seeking to be restored to pow
er. admit tiiat. Tiie only objections
j is that the Republicans raise to the
present, prosperity are, first.that only
Republican administrations are sup
posed to create prosperity; second,
tiiat proscrit) is not attributable to
I Democratic administration, anyway;
i tliird. tiiat while the country is ad
1 mittediy prosperous, it will not last,
"it is all based on munitious of
war," tiie Republican critics of pros
peiity say, ' 'ami when the war is over
it will go Hooey. - '
What are the facts'*
The official figures of tiie Depart
ment of Commerce show that i lie
country's so-called "war business"
d.ies not exceed live percent of its to
tal industrial and commercial activ
ity. The L nited States Steel Cotpor
aiion handles no "war business" and
yet it Is now doing a record-break inn
business.
For the third month in succession
tiie steel corporation has reported a
high record in unfilled orders. The
tmnage as of April 30, 1916, was
»,829,551 tons, an increase of 49»,5T»0
tons over the business booked at the
end of March. The phenomenal show
ing for recent months indicates not
merely the prosperity of the company
itself and the steady employment of
thousands of men engaged In the
steel plants, hut also tells the story
of new bridges being built, new rails
being laid, and new steel buildings
constructed iu various parts of the
country, in all sections there has
been an inciease in building opera
tions which is reflected in tiie report
of the steel corporation.
in tiie perpld of nine months the
trade of tiie United States with
Soutti America has more than doubl
ed. Exports to South America in
tbe nine mouths period increased
fronr*62,ono,uoo to 12»,uOO.uOo. This
was due largely to tiie supplanting of
European goods witli American
goods, but it was made possible solely
through the better understanding
brought about by the present Demo
cratic administration in Washington.
Bankers throughout the country
frankly admit that the leadership of
Secretary McAdnu, of the Treasury
Department, saved tiie tinancial sit
uation of the United States after the
, European war began and it was as a
! result of that same leadership tli »t

Mia* Kelly Tells of Funny Exp«
riecea in Lemhi County When
Here Last Winter.
Boise Statesman. I
Miss Amy Kelly and Misa B'own of
the university extension department
of the University ot hlaim, are in
great demand all over tiie state for
talks on domestic science, balanced
meals, labor saving devices, borne
decoration ansi canning. So great bas
bien tiie demand for their services,
•he university has had to insist tiiat
at least 5o wouieu will lie Matched at
every lecture, it was, therefore, with
misgiving that a request from Ten
doy, Lemhi county, wee received ask
ing for their services, the letter ad
ding:
"We have only Id women in (his
hamlet, but we do want Miss Kelly
to com« to talk to ua so liadly tiiat
we will agree to fill up tiie repuislte
number with bachelors, who need it
just as much as we do, goodness!
knows." Tbe Invitation whs too en
tidug h>r Miss Rnlly ta refuse, and
site is highly enthusiastic over hei
trip to tlds region, her tirst vial' to
Lemhi county.
* 'There was only one drawback to
the entire trim and that was the trip
over tile Pittsburg A Glluiore line,"
she said. "1 am sure those coaches
came out of the ark, they are so moth
eaten you are almost afraid vou will
fall through; hut I supixiae they are
such a luxury after the stage coach
days that no one eise complains about
them.
The people.of l.emhl valley are the
greasiest boosters 1 evtr saw. I over
heard one woman say tiiat Miss Kei
ly needn't think she could tell the
people of tiiat valley anything, that
it had lieen settled early in tiie bis
tro) of the territory, and tiie people
were a little kingdom unto them
selves. If we should grow some sug
ar beets here and IIml a little salt,
both of which are possible, we would
not have to go outside for a tlung;
we raise every tiling we moot right
here', site said "
Miss Kelly's sense of humor lias
lightened many burdens tor lier and
given her a new zest for life. She
tells this juke on herself while at
Tendoy:
."I talked Uuejdght before on labor
saving devices for the farmer's home,
