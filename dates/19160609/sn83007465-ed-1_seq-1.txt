audience, was closely listened to
throughout and enjoyed by all present
who went away from the meeting
feeling that they were well repaid
for their attendance; that they
had gained much valuable information
from listening to Dr. Faison's
fine lecture concerning the health
and the proper care and protection

to making examinations deserve
great commendation and the thanks
of the entire community. Too much

one battleoruisor, one ship of (lie l'n?

cruisers and ilvo torpedo boats. The ':M
-t itement says:
'Of in < lo ses the battleship
I'ommern was launched in 1905.!*^
Tiie loss of the cruisers Wiesbaden
F
Elbing, Frauenlob, and five torpedo
SC
boats bat already been reported in
Phial statements. For militarv
T
reasons we refrained until now from
making public the loss of the hattiecruiser
Lutzow and the cruiser
Rostock."
The destruction of the Lut/.ow W
was claimed in the first statement ''
?sued by the British admiralty. At
the sane lime the British claimed '
that two German battleships had
ci
1 een sen? to the bottom and six destroyers
as well as a submarine. The
British, however, only claimed to
have sunk one German light cruiser.
Tiie Rostock was of 4.900 tons,
built in 1912, and carried a crew o!' '
.172 men. She was armed with 12
1
rour-lnch guns and two torpedo
v
tubes. The I.utzow was a 20.000 j
ton ship.
The statement savs iheso are all !
the losses sustained by the Germans. L'

said to have been heavier than adj

1 ' The statement savs many official J -j
and semi-official reports from the1
. British side have systematically
spread abroad "in order to deny the'
1 greatness of the British lefeat in (1
the naval battle of May 31 and ore-: r
ate an impression that the battle was i
' a victory for Hritish arms."
The statement continues: "It is sa- i
{ serted for instance that the Germans i
left the battlefield and that the Rrit- j
ish fleet remained master of the hat- t
tletteld. With regard to this it is f
stated that by repeated effective at. , i
i i tacks of our torpedo boat flotilla s
j; during the battle on the evening of t
May 31 the English main fleet was
forced to turn round and it never , i
1 again came withtn sight of our i

Chicago. Jiino 0.?Th, Republican,
mention today accepted the invitain
of the I'mpri s~ivp convention to
coniciencH tor harmony. A propo1
to that end adopted first in the
ogressive convetninn was received
the Republican convention and
lopted with a few scattering "noes"
id virtually no demonstration. Senor
Stnoot of I'tali, Senator Rorah
ldiho, Former Senator Crane of
assnelu? tts. Nicholas Murray Butr
of the New Yorh delegation and
ormer Representative A. R. Johnm
of Ohio wei> appointed as the
epubican conl'eren?e committee,
hey at once began arrangements for
eetimr the Progressives.
The romplex'on of the committee
as generaHy regarded as one that
ould not accept Roosevelt for tho
residential nomination but on the
ther hand would not insist on
lughes. The whole effect of the de_
elopincnt was to throw the republian
nomination into uncertainty unil
'lie conferees report.
The other principal developments
n dip Republican convention were
lie adoption of the platform as remrted
by the resolution committee
leaded by Senator Lodge, a half minite
demonstration for Col. Rooseelt
when his name was mentioned
or the first time in the convention
lie perfection of the permanent oran'za'ion

' lurk t otnoi row.
S?-*-.itor i.-lvc mentioned Col.

*hiili tip'nes plank which declare!
()' the porev inaugurated hy Mcvinley
and lontiniiid l.y Roosevelt.
Phe di 111011stration was principally
n the galleries.
The outstanding incident of the
lay came with Senator Lodge's anlouncement
of the woman suffrage
dank.
"The Republican party, reafflrmng
its faith in government of the
leople. by the people for the people,
is a measure ?f justice to one-half
he adult people of this country,
avors th? extension of suffrange to
vomen," read the senator and the
uiffragists began their demonstraion.
"But," continued Senator I.odge
vhen the noise subsided, "it recoglizes
the right of each State to settle
his i|U?ation for itself."
There wee roars .of laughter at
his uiialilying phrav to what the
uiffraggists had comHuered as a
lenr cut victory and the convention
til rang with the d^rnonstration of
