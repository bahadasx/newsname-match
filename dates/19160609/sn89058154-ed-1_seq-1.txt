j NEW YORK j
LETTER i
W4
There is a death in New York city
for every three minutes of every day,
and the births about keep up the same
rate." 'Terrible crimes are committed
every day, but the police force, one
of the beat in the world, manages to
catch almost every criminal. Their
work is sometimes marvelous. "For
instance, that atrocious murder of the
girl Anna Aumuller by the priest,
Father Schmidt, about three years
ago, for which he was recently
lectrocntnd, :Ihe girl was his serv
ant. He had mistreated her, and then
killed her, cut her body up and put it
in sacks and dropped the grewsome
packages separately in the Harlem
river, trusting to the tide to sweep
the evidences of his . guilt from . the
sight of men; and so it did for
awhile. ' Part of the body was found,
wrapped in pillow. cases, floating' on
.the New Jersey side of the Hudson
river. The, trade-mark of the store
where the pillow cases were bought
, was still on the cloth,' and starting
with that Blight clew, Inspector
Faurot of thaNew' Toik police de
tectives traced the crime to the door
of the priest, who confessed. ' ? t
If I were to start out to write of
the crimes committed here, or even
to. mention ' them, . you would have
room for nothing else, but there are a
few which will be interesting to tell
of. On Christmas' last, the daughter
of a Lutheran minister, who had been
missing soma, day 8 from her home in
the Bronx diHtrict of the city, being
kept a prisoner by some bad Italians
Dot far from her home, was put up
on a barrel and auctioned off for fifty
dollars to a white slaver.' The girl
was discovered almost in a dying con
dition, and the guilty parties sent up
for twenty years in prison.
; A mother and her two children, the
vounsrest a babe of three months
Whom she had in a baby carriage,
rer going along a street in the
roox some . time ago. The oldest
hili wanted some candy, and the
lother left the carriage and the little
"kbe for a few moments while she
Went in a stare to buy candy. As
J they started to walk along, the older
child said: "Mamma, what is the mat
ter with babyT The little mite was
making no noise, but was gasping for
breath. The horrified mother took it
to a drug-store, and there it was
found that some fiend, not fit to be
r
called human, had poured a Btrong
chemical ly sol, down its throat, and
that it was dying. It perished that
night. Tna woman was a Jewess who
bad married a Gentile, but Jews as
well as everybody else were horrified
and incensed, and did their very best
to unearth the guilty party, but all to
no purpose.
Occasionally, girls traveling'ln the
subways and elevated lines find that a
corrosive acid has been squirted on
their fine silk dresses and shoes, or
slit with a knife bo S3 to ruin the
clothes. There are people who keep
up that dastardly work for no appar
ent reason except that they are crazy
in that, way, but smart enough to
keep from being caught. Rich wom
en are sometimes detected at steal
ing goods in the big stores. Some of
them have specially designed dresses
with pockets big enough to stow away
quantities of stuff. There is generally
a small room in each big store where
a lady officer makes these shoplifters
strip and give up their ill-gotten
goods. I have heard that large sums
of money have been paid by these
thieves to be allowed to go without
detection. A big, fat woman was ar
rested in a downtown store some years
ago before New York reformed
as she wa9 trying to recruit her
white slave traffic among the poor
shop girls. '. The arrest was made by
a federal officer, but her influence
with the store people was such that
they made a strong fight to have the
thing hushed up. Her patronage
was worth several thousand dollars a
month to the store, and it was
brought out afterward that her in-'
come from immoral traffic in girls
amounted to forty thousand dollars a
month. But Uncle Sam's men can't
be called off by any one,, and the
woman, to the great disgrace of the
store manager, was tried and sent up
for a long term. ,
Everybody hates a poisoner. That
is why this great city was stirred to
its depths last March when Dr. Arthur
Waite, a fashionable young dentist,
was arrested for doing to death his
wife's father, John Peck, of Grand
Rapids, Michigan, who was staying
with the young man here, having lost
his wife. The old man was a million
aire; his wife had just 'died, and the
son-in-law wanted the money, and fed
the old man on arsenic. He had a
beautiful apartment on Riverside
Drive, overlooking the Hudson; the
old man was giving him $300 a month
to live on, and his wife's aunt had let
him have ?70,000 to invest, for her,
which he had' himself appropriated.
He had a young wife who loved him;
was a fine tennis player, a student of
languages, and a popular society man;
one would think he would be satisfied.
0, no. He wanted the old man's mil
lion, so he could be looked up to as
the rich and powerful Dr. Waite. '
The whole terrible Btory came out
gradually after the young dentist was
arrested, and it Was a story that made
even this city gasp. Cooly, the pris
oner told how he had first gone to
work on his wife's mother. She loved
him as a son,, and had favored him
when the old man objected to his suit
for the daughter's hand. , He went to
the big hospitals and bought most
virulent germs of disease, such as
typhoid fever and pneumonia, that he
could find, and mixed them with the
old lady's food, and with, his father-in-law's
food, too. She died of pneu
monia, and her body . was cremated.
The wife's aunt, Miss Peck, who had
placed a fortune in the fellow's hands,
found sand in some jam one day, and
took it back to the grocer who had
sold it to her; the grocer apologized
and refunded the money for the jam.
The young poisoner had put ground
glass in it! The old- man was too
healthy to sicken from the germs
that had carried away his wife, so
Waite tried arsenic on him, putting it
in his Boup. A servant saw him put
some while powder in the soup; Waite
said it was medicine; the old man
didn't like the soup, but the poisoner
told him it would do him good, and
the trusting old man, believing that
his son-in-law, who claimed great
medical knowledge, was trying to help
him (Peck was already suffering from
an earlier dose of the poison), gulped
down the mixture that took away his
life that night.
Then Waite was anxious to have
the body cremated! He could hardly
wait to get it to the old home at
Grand Rapids. But the All-seeing Eye
was npon the young dentist. A mys
terious telegram, signed "K. Adams",
reached the son, Mr. Peck Jr., which
read: ''Suspicions aronsed; insist
on autopsy." So when the body
reached Grand Rapids, the son
wanted to take the body, but young
Waite said it must be cremated. The
son had the body examined, and
enough arsenic v was found in the
stomach to kill several men. Waite
hurried back to New York; called up
the Hotel Phza, and told a "Mrs.
Walters" there to pack up his things
and take them away, and leave there.
Then he took a heavy dose of sul
phonal, and tried to die by an easier
route than the one by which he had
sent the old man to his death. The
officers found him in' a stupor, and
took hira to the hospital. Waite could
only stammer out the lie that he had
given poison to his father-in-law at
the request of the old man himself,
who was grieving over the death of
his wife and wanted to die. The news
was flashed all over the country.
Imagine the feelings of the' young
poisoner's parents, who thought their
son rich and happy in New York; how
the horror burst on their peacful
home like lava from the volcano of
damnation. Bathed in tears, but still
believing in the fellow's innocence,
they rushed to the big city, only to
find that he had confessed to every
thing and said he was ready to die
for his crimes.
In the trial that followed, lasting
less than a week, the story of his life
was brought out. He had been a ly
ing, thieving boy, cruel to animals,
immoral as soon as he was old enough
to be so, lazy and quarrelsome. He
told the whole story himself, and bis
father and brothers corroberated him,
in the pitiful hope of proving him in
sane. In an hour he was found guilty
by the jury. The poor old father
fainted; the young man smiled. He
was hustled away to the Tombs, the
famous, dark old jail that has housed
so many great criminals for awhile
on their journey to death.
To-day, the lint of June, he was
sentenced to die in the electric chair
on July 10th. In the court-room he
calmly thanked all who had been con
cerned in the trial and then said: "I
took a life, and am giving my own
cheerfully for it. My, body is already
dead, but my soul lives, and in the
life to come, will strive to atone for
what I did here. I am now reading
the Bible, and it looks so much differ-!
ent to me than it used to. Had I
read it more, during the past ten
years, I would now be honored and
secure. I had to be crushed in order
to know how to live." " v
His honesty of confession is the
only light spot about that Bark figure,
now so soon to lose its vital spark by
the stern hand of the law, but hones
ty and truth came to . him too late. !
He said he had broken every command
but one, having never been profane.
He is only twenty-nine years old. A I
beautiful young woman, Mrs.: Marga
ret Horton, shared a room with him
at the great' hotel, where they pre
tended to be studying" music and lan
guages together. , J
The crushed and broken figure of
that poor old mother of the poisoner
is the most pathetic thing I knowof.
When, in the pain and agony that all
mothers must undergo, she brought
forth that little babe, she .cheerfully
endured the trial for the sake, of the
new life that had been entrusted to
her keeping. Now, in keener pangs
than we may conceive of, she sees
that precious child hurried away to
Sing Sing, and knows that soon he
will enter that little green, door to
the execution' chember; the unseen
hand of the executioner will turn a
lever, and one of nature's primal
forces will rend his mortal life apart,
and he who was born in love and faith
and a mother's hope, will die in black
disgrace and lie in a dishonored
grave! 0, the misery, that a thous
and years of joy cannot efface the
sword that passes through that faith
ful mother-heart at every breath, the
undeserved agony that will not sleep,
the worm that will not die . till she
joins that unworthy son in the land
of shadows!
Can any of us be thankful enough
that our own mothers passed away
while all was well with us, and that
we were not, through bd undeserved
grace from the Most High, turned
aside from an end like this.

In Mkmoriam
Epaminondas D. M. Perkins, died at Orlando, Florida, June
5, 1913; buried near old Purdy, Tennessee, June 10, 1913.
While musing at the close of day.
I think of him now far away:
The man whose honored name I bear,
Whose mortal fate I soon will share.
He was not born of common clay;
His soul reflected back the ray
Of clouded radiance rich and rare
Intended for a world more fair.
He toiled to feed his growing brood
With genius lurking in his mood.
'Mid common sounds, hi3 listening ears
Could catch the music of the spheres.
While laboring in his low estate .
He felt his kinship with the great;
While humbly ploughing through the clods
He held communion with the gods.
Mute poet! In the better life,
United to thy gifted wife,
My motaer freed from every care,
Thy soul shall find expression there!

Lorena, Okla.
Independent: .
After, being absent from McNairy
for a short time, I thought perhaps
the readers of the Independent would
be interested in a few facts about the
West.
It would make my letter too long
to try to tell of all I have seen on my
trip. As I came through . Missouri
the peach orchards attracted my at
tention very much, the largest of
which is said to cover about 11,000
acres. . The peach crop last year was
very great. Cars couldn't be had in
which to ship the fruit, consequently
many thousand bushek went to waste.
While winding our way around
the Ozark mountains, we travelled
along by the side of Spring river for
about 50 miles. This river is one of
the beautiful rivers of America.
Tourists say they never get tired of
seeing this river, the water of which
ia harnessed to propel much machin
ery. The river is fed by a eprinR the
largest in America, and probably in
the world. The spring covers several
acres, and looks like a lake. It is the
only spring with a bridge over it that
I know of, the water of which is cold
but never freezes.
Just at sunset on .May 9 we found
ourselves on top of tho Ozark
mountain, the highest peak of which
is 5,750 feet high. Well, believe me,
there was a good breeze stirring.
What about that family that lives at
Cedar Gap? That is the name of the
place. After spending the night in
Springfield, Mo., we made a dashing
run through the wheat fields, coal
mine?, and oil well districts of Mis
souri and Kansas, and arrived in Kan
sas City at 4:30 p.m.
It was a treat to me to have the
pleasure, while spending the night in
the great city, of being one of 23,
000 who attentively listened to Billy
Sunday. Billy is some preacher. His
sermon was to the working young
ladies of the city that night, and
when the call was extended to them
244 responded. When the little choir
Their First-Born Son.
of 700 began to sing, I was reminded
of the McNairy Co. singing conven
tion. After one more day's ride I found
myself in "Noman's Land", as it was
once called, or in other words the
Pan Handle of Oklahoma. This is a
beautiful country. I realize that the
poet knew what he was doing when
dotted down the words, "The desert
shall bloom as the rose." That is be
ing seen in this part of the country,
where nearly all of the people live in
fine houses surrounded by good orch
ards, gardens, that is, where they
want them fine live stock sheltered
m painted barns, waving wheat as far
as your eye will let you see, and a
Ford to sport about in.
It has indeed been a Dleasure to me
to be in the homes of Charlie and
Peter Plunk, both Hardin county
boys who cames west many years
ago, and both are doing well. Char
lie has just completed a fine dwelling
and barn, and he has one of the fin
est orchards I have ever seen. It is
surpassed by the orchards of Missouri
in size only.
The writer had the pleasure of
making a tour of about 270 miles
west in an automobile to a public land
sale last week. The price of the land
sold ranged from $320 per quartor
section' to $4,100.
I know some one is ready to, ask,
do yeu all have any wind and water
out there? Well, if you . could just
see the wind mill as it lifts the water
from mother earth and pours it out
in each room of the houses.Mf wanted,
you would say good water is plenti
ful And if you would just come and
take a bath in a sand storm, where
apparently once and a while a rock is
thrown in for good measure,' you
would say that the wind did blow.
There are many other things that I
would like to tell of, but it would be
too much for this time. : 1
With best wishes to the readers of
the Independent, I am, ,

We are safe in saying that -they are the
