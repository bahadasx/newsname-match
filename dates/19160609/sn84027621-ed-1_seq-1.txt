ALLIES UNABLE TO
TAKE THE OFFENSIVE
Bulgars and' Teutons Entirely Too
Strong for Them in the
A Balkans
(Associated Press)
Sofia, June 9. In military quarters
at the Macedonian front and in polit
ical circles here the opinion is ; ex
pressed to the Associated Press cor
respondent that while an offensive
move on the part of the entente
forces at Saloniki is not out of the
question, such a maneuver would be
devoid of all prospects of success if
undertaken with fewer than fifty
army corps, or about 2,000,000 men.
Thus far the entente allies have
brought to Saloniki about 350,000 ef
f ectives. With the addition of 100,
000 Serbians the entente contingent
would still be below , a half a million
men, a force considered here as being
entirely inadequate to undertake the
rehabilitation of Serbia.
The terrain difficulties which the
entente troops would be obliged to
overcome are regarded as enormous.
In all cases the entente troops would
have to fight uphill. One or two ad
mittedly weak points in the Bulgaro
Austro-German line are amply cover
ed by stronger positions immediately
in the rear, it is stated to the corres
pondent, so that a falling-back would
be an entirely strategical affair.

SWOPE AGAIN VIEWS
SITE OF THE PARK
He Went Ovei the Ground this Morn
ing and Expressed Himself as
More Pleased than Before ,
Mr. Harold B. S wope went over the
Taylor pond property again this morn
ing, and expressed himself as more
impressed with the park possibilities
of the place than when he first looked
at it. Mr. Swope has been uncle to
arrange for a plat of the property,
and he will probably be delayed in
perfecting plans for the park. He
takes the view, however, that this will
give him that much more time to work
out a design. He says that there will
be no difficulty about the city's con
tinuing to remove lime from the
quarry on the property, if it desires
to do so. He is rather pleased with
this feature, and believes that it will
add instead of subtract from the
beauty of the park.
Mr. and. Mrs. Swope leave tomor
row afternoon" f or , Birmingham, Ala.,
where he has a landscape commission.
They will return to 4 Eastlake about
the first of August.
GREAT CROPS OF GRAIN
Will Enable the German People to
Better Stand the Stress
of the War
Berlin, June 9. Everything indi
cates that Germany will ; have un
usually good grain crops this year.
From all parts of the country the re
ports are most satisfactory. The win
ter was mild, and thus far the spring
weather has been well-nigh ideal.
The rainfall has continued satis
factory in nearly all parts of the
country; hence grain anct) meadow
grass have been making fine progress.
Livestock has been turned out to
grass, and thus the scarcity of feed
stuffs has been relieved. The great
est danger just now for the grain
crops is that there may be a relapse
of cold weather, which may injure the
well-advanced plants. Another factor
that is expected to increase- Ger
many's production of grain and other
crops is that much moorland has
been reclaimed and will now come
into cultivation for the first time.
The prospects for an excellent fruit
crop are .also good.

808, Bryan 15,899, Wall 9,379 and
Gilchrist 6,644. Of the counties not
tabulated I have carried all but one
and my lead will be increased . 3,000
votes more. -
Returns indicate I have carried
forty-five counties, Bryan six and
Wall one. This, indeed, is a most
remarkable victory and I am pro
foundly grateful to the people of
Florida , for this expression of confi
dence. To the many thousands who
supported me I wish to express my
sincere gratitude and appreciation.

Republicans Have Nailed Their
Planks Together
Til COilVEIITIOliS AT CHICAGO
A! LIKELY TO SOOII
(Associated
Auditorium Chicago, June 9. The
Progressive convention reconvened at
ten twenty-six o'clock this morning.
Chairman Robins brought the plat
form before the convention at ten
forty-nine. Dean Lewis read the
platform section by section, each be
ing acted upon as offered. Some
planks, particularly suffrage, are ex
pected to be debated.
The committee appointed to confer
with the Republican peace commit
tee was cheered as it entered the
hall at eleven thirty.
Roosefvelt's secretary, John W. Mc-
Grath, and William Loeb Jr fre
quently mounted the platform and
conferred with party leaders, who buz
zed with activity. McGrath and
Loeb are understood to have taken
postione in anteroom connected by
telephone with Oyster Bay.
After leaving rostrum first time,
Loeb said, "We hope to keep the con
vention from doing anything foolish."
He declined to interpret the word
"foolish,", , ,:J:-,
There was a report circulating to
which the managers gave ready ear,
that Roosevelt intended to : withdraw
his name. There seemed no compe-1
tent authority for prediction and the
radicals said, "they would name Teddy
anyway." ,
The conference committee reported
a harmonious meeting with the Re
publicans. The Republicans did not
present any name. The progressives
urged Roosevelt. The . Republicans
advanced no concrete proposition ex
cept that a further conference might
be desirable this afternoon.
REPUBLICAN PLATFORM
Chicago, June 9. -The republicans
late - yesterday adopted the platform
submitted by the resolutions commit
tee and read by Senator Lodge.
The platform contains a declaration
to preserve American rights wher
ever they are violated, a declaration
urging strict neutrality in the war,
but insisting on the preservation of
neutral rights "without fear or fa
vor." This section referring to the
foreign relations attacks the admin
istration which, the platform says,
"has destroyed our influence abroad
and humiliated us in our own eyes."
A declaration guaranteeing protec
tion to the Mexican border residents
and condemning the administration
for Jts Mexican policy, especially in
the recognition of Carranza, reaffirm
ation of the Monroe doctrine and
continuance of the republican policies
in Latin-America; the renewal of al
legiance to the Philippine policy of
McKinley, Taf t and Roosevelt, with
the assertion that the United States
should accept the responsibility on
the' islands as a "duty to civilization."
The democratic Philippine bill is
condemned, and the platform advo-?
cates a high protective tariff, saying
the Underwood tariff is a complete
failure. The creation of a tariff com
mission is promised. Declarations
favoring regulations of railroads and
industries are. contained. The plat
form stands for rural credit laws, but
condemns the democratic rural credits
bill, and the extension of rural free
delivery. Laws to strengthen the
merchant marine are advocated, but
the democratic ship purchase bill is
scored. Declarations for a national
budget system, conservation of civil
service to conform to labor laws are
advocated. The platform favors
woman suffrage, but leaves the mat
ter for a decision of the states.
: The outstanding incident in the
day's session of the republicans came
when Senator ' Lodge announced the
suffrage plank. Women started dem
onstrations before Senator Lodge got
to the portion of the plank which said,
"but the republicans recognize the
right of each state to settle the ques
tion for itself." Laughter followed
this oualif yincr phrase to what the
suffragists had been cheering as a
clean-cut victory. : 1 :

ence committee, was featured by
speeches by Victor Murdock and Con
gressman McDonald of Michigan.
Murdock declared the only thing to
do was to nominate Roosevelt before
the convention adjourned yesterday.
McDonald; in finishing his address
urging Roosevelt's selection, said the
"thing to do is to tell the republi

FINANCIAL PATRIOTISM
OF PEOPLE OF FRANCE
Bringing Ten Million Dollars a Day
to Aid in the National Defense
' (Associated Press)
Paris, June 9. The records of the
national defense bonds at the minis
try of finances show that the public
is now bringing to the treasury an
average of 50 million francs cash a
day in exchange for the short term
obligations at 5 per cent. This is
more than a billion and a half a
month,4 or 18 billion a year, which is
three billion more than the war of
1870 cost. "That fact," says a high
authority on French finance, "shows
sufficiently that the cautious . French
public is not alarmed by the financial
requirements of the French effort."
