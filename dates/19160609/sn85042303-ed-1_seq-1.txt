Petrograd reports a continuance of
the Russian jsuccesses in Volhynia,

THOUSANDS OF CATHOLICS

New York. June 8. It is expected
that the fifteenth anual convention of
the American Federation of Catholic
Saddles to be held in this city in
August next will draw to New York
the greatest gathering of Roman Cath
olics even assembled in this city.
During the federation week of the
American Federation of Catholic So
cities, the Catholic Young Men's Na
tional Union, the New York State
League German Catholic Verein, the
German Roman Catholic Central
Verein and other Catholic societies
will be in session. It Is expected that

itors. McGRAW CHOSEN REPUBLICAN
NATIONAL COMMITTEEMAN
Chicago, June 8. James J. Mc
Graw of Ponca City will be republi
can natioial committeeman from Ok
lahoma for the term of four years,
action of the national convention
Wednesday having been favorable to
the report of the credentials com
mittee which gave the fifth and sixth
districts to McGraw delegates. John
R. Hadley and Charles G. Moore, con
testing delegates from the fifth dis
trict, were seated, reversing the ac
tion of the national committee which
placed A. B. Wood and O. A. Mlt
scher on the temporary roll. Mr.
Wood died in Chicago a few days
ago.
The action of the national con
vention in seating the McGraw dele
gation of the fifth and sixth district,
appears to have put an end to the
hope of J. A. Harris to have him
self named by the national conven
tion to succeed himself as national
committeeman, contrary to the action
of the state convention.

American Consulate at Durango Re
ported Destroyed by Rioters, Who
Fired Building After Dragging U.
S. Flag Through Streets.
El Paso, Tex., June 9. Customs
inspectors at the international bridge
here early today received telegraphic
instructions from Washington to per
mit no Americans to enter Mexico
from here, until further notice. No
reason was given for these instruc
tions. Information was received here last
night that the American consulate at
Durango City was destroyed by fire
during an anti-American demonstra
tion. The rioters are said to have
applied a torch to the building after
dragging the American flag through
the streets.
Anti-American riots are also re
ported from Chihuahua City. Gen
oral Gavira, the Carranza commander
of northern Mexico, issued a state
ment last night in which he de
clared the anti-American riots were
entirely an affair of the citizens,
and that the Mexican government au
thorities were in no way counten
ancing them. The Mexican authori
ties at Juarez declared that the
Chihuahua situation is now under
control.
A CERTAINTY
MASS MEETING LAST NIGHT DE
VELOPED SOME REAL, TAN-
GIBLE IDEAS PREPARED TO
HELP.
That it would be a matter of great
foresight for the city to secure the
lot on which the tabernacle now
stands was manifest last night at
the mass meeting in that place and
a few patriotic citizens are going to
purchase the lot and tender It to the
city for the purpose of a convention
hall site within the next twelve
months. Ten thousand dollars is
the purchase price and nearly half
of that was subscribed before the
meeting was held and no attempt
was made at the meeting to get sub
scribers, as it was realized that the
balance would be gotten without
much effort.
The concensus of opinion at the
meeting was that sooner or later
Ardmore would have to provide a
place for large meetings, just as
other cities have, and that the prop
erty now being secured must double
in value within a very short time.
No discussion was made as to when
the city should improve the property
but at the suggestion of S. A. Apple,
a committee of five will be appointed
by . the Chamber of Commerce to
thoroughly advance the convention
j hall idea and at the proper time pre
sent their findings to another mass
I meeting. No immediate action is
expected from this committee, al
though it was strongly urged that the
matter be kept alive.
The meeting was called to order
by Secretary West of the Chamber
of Commerce, who suggested that a
permanent organization be perfected
and moved that G. A. Ramsey be
made chairman. The motion was
seconded by Rev. C. C. Weith, and
he was unanimously chosen.
Mr. Ramsey, in accepting the chair,
commended the object of the meet-

BORAH GOES TO
PROGRESSES
SENATOR BORAH SURPRISES THE
MOOSERS BY APPEARANCE AT
AUDITORIUM TODAY.
IS FOR ROOSEVELT
Borah Tells Progressives That if Two
Conventions Agree Upon Roosevelt
He Will Support Him Borah
as Compromise Candidate.
Auditorium, Chicago, June 9. With
out any preliminary announcement,
Senator William E. Borah, republican,
entered the progressive convention at
12:45 today and addressed the con
vention, saying he had come over
to "get inspiration."
A wave swept the floor, suggesting
that stronger events than harmony
with Borah as the man to unite the
raities, might happen.
There were cheers for Roossvelt
as Borah mentioned the name of the
progresslv leader. He said he guess
ed there was not any doubt that they
wanted Teddy, but urged them to be
cautious In their actions as the two
conventions now in session' will per
haps decide the welfare of the Uni
ted States for the next quarter of a
century. Borah said if the two con
ventions agreed on Roosevelt, he
would be a willing supporter. When
he had concluded the progressives
recessed until 3 o'clock.
The conference committee is said
to be watching the situation closely
to determine whether there is any
use to try again to get together.
Thi depended, it was said, on
whether the republicans went on
with their nominations, or desired
further parleys.
Borah's visit was said by Perkins
to be "Another sign of the friendly
spirit between the two conventions."
Perkins said he could not know what
significance could be attached to the
senator's visit.
Some leaders suggested that Borah
might be a compromise candidate, as
was suggested by republicans In the
peace meeting last night.
"Anyway, we are making a record
for ourselves that will set us right
before the country. No matter the
outcome, we've got them anyway,"
said Perkins.
Women delegates were victorious
In striking from the progressive plat
form the word "male" In the declara
tion that "Every male citizen charg
ed with the duty of defending his
country," and the word "his" was
changed to "our."
Further discussion of the platform
as unfinished business was flrBt taken
up by the progressives today, when
they convened at 10:49. It was ex
pected that some of the planks, par
ticularly woman suffrage, would be
debated.
When the progressives' peace con
ferees entered the auditorium, they
were given an ovation.
