Meeting Will Be On Tuesday
Night Interest Is Now
Rapidly Increasing
Paris will get in the prepared
ness band wagon Tuesday night,
when a meeting is to be held at
the court house for the purpose
of giving a demonstration for
preparedness and to complete
the organization of the local
militia company. This will
probably be the last opportunity
that those who wish to enlist
will have to do so, and will be
positively the last chance that
members will have to participate
in the election of officers for the
company.
" The call for the meeting has
been issued by Col. F. M. Van-
"4qxhMe, T. A. Smith and Dr. J.
j. Weldoh. In the call it is
urged that every man with red
blood in his veins attend.
It is stated that the captain of
the militia company will probably
be a man who served under Gen.
Pershing in the Phillippines a
man that has had experience in
the regular army and that under
stands the kind of service the
local company would be called
upon to perform.
It is especially important that
all members of the company be
present Tuesday night, and all
others who are interested in
preparedness and the company,
whether they wish to enlist or
not, are expected to be on hand
for the big rally and demonstra
tion. PARIS BOYS GOING TO

Interesting Meeting Expected
Tuesday Night When Matter
To Be Settled
RAILWAY WOULD CONSTRUCT
DOUBLE-TRACK THRU PARIS
Park Question Likely To Come
Before Council At the
Regnlar Meeting
Some members of the city
council, it is stated, want the
N. C. & St. L. railway to con
struct a viaduct at Rison street
when they extend their local
yards and double-tract through
Paris, and it is over this point
that a fight is likely to develop
at the regular monthly meeting
of the body Tuesday night when
the double-tracting ordinance will
be considered.
The railway has agreed to con
struct a viaduct at the intersec
tion of Dunlap street and the
company's right of way, but
so far no agreement has been
reached in regard to the Rison
street crossing, it is understood.
The proposed ordiance, al
though drafted some weeks ago,
has never been presented to the
council officially. However, in
dividual members of the council
have discussed the proposition
among themselves and with re
presentative of the railway in an
effort to reach an understanding.
Those who desire that the rail
way construct a viaduct at the
Rison street crossing insist that
the company now keeps a flagman
at this point and that with a
double-track and many more
trains even this will not be suf
ficient, and that the services of
the flagman would not be neces
sary with the viaduct.
Another matter of interest that
will probably be acted upon at the
meeting of the council Tuesday
night is the matter of the pur
chase of property for a city park.
The park movement has been on
foot for several weeks and those
who are interested may present
to the council a proposition to
either buy or lease a site.
SUNDAY SCHOOL PICNIC
Members of the First Christian
Bible School enjoyed a picnic at
the McCampbell Grove, South of

were present and all report a good
time.
fact they do not expect to
derive any financial benefits
from the hospital, or any other
benefits except that the institu
tion will serve as a great conven
ience to them.
The hospital movement is con
sidered a worthy one by every
body. The need of such an
institution has been long felt in
Paris and the people are glad
that the opening will soon take
place. It is expected that the
city and county will make ap
propriations for the benefit of
those not able to bear the ex
Dense of admittance to the
hospital when ill.
