tian coming to the gates of the
Celestial City, John Bunyan wroter
'Now, I saw' in my dream that
these two went in. at the gate, and
lol. as they entered, they were
: transfigured, and they had raimen
put on that shone like gold. " Then
I heard in my dream that all the
- bells in the city rang for joy, and
; it was said, unto them, 'Enter ye
into the joy of your Lord, and
after that they shut up the gates,
which, when I had seen, I wished
myself among them. They go from
strength to strength, from jby to
joy forever.' : I

The death angel has entered the
home of our beloved cousin and
claimed for its' victim little Willie
Blanks. The boy was a bright,
manly little fellow; kind and affec
tionate, aud to- kuo w him was to
love him; We prav that he may
be a link that will bind the family
into an unbroken chain around the
great white throne where they may
praise the Lord through time and
eternity, . -

Chautauqua at Big Sandy.
' The Kadcliffe Chautauqua Co.
was at Big Sandy for a season of
three days this week. As an edu-
cational venture the attractions are -high
class, and along with other
splendid featuresv there was plenty :
of fun and amusement for both old
and young.
Big Sandy's citizens may not
make good on the venture from a -
financial standpoint, but we admire
them for their .pluck and congrat
ulate them for their enterprise.
Camden turned ' down this at. '
traction because of the "expense .,
iqvolved. But when you come to
figure it out, did you ever really,
accomplish auythiug worth whila
without some expense in one way '
orauother? --
Card of Thsnks.
There are hours that come into
the lives of some, when every im- 1
pulse of our nature is buried under -a
night of sorrow. This, is where
we stand toly:' end jet we fain :
would give expression to the grati- '.
tude of our hearts as we recVraber
the kindness , of those who did so
much to comfort our precious dead
and to brighten for us aTstarlees sky,
