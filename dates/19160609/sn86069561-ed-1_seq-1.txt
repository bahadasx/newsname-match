Rail Road Company retired Uncle
Dave Hurt as Section foreman, I
putting him on a gcod'hving pen
sion. Just forty one years t a
day, Mr. Hurt has been in charge,
as foreman, of the Brodhead sec
tion. He began his rail road car
eer forty-seven years ago when he
became a section hand on the
Richmond Branch, working there
three wars. He was then trans
ferred to the Brodhead section
and labored here for four years as
a section hand, then was promoted
as foreman, which place he has
held ever since. During the forty
one years Uncle Dave has been
right on the job every day with the
exception ol about four months he
was unable to superintend the
work on account of sickness. Mr.
Hurt has the honor of being one
ot the best tract men in the ser
vice of the L. & N. and doubtless
ly the best man in the entire ser
vice. When he came to Brodhead
forty-four years ago there was lit
tle here then that still remains ex
cept the rivers, hills and what earth
connect them, and besides only
one man lives within the corpor
ate limits of the town that was
living here when Uncle Dave
moved here, and that man is our
J. Cr. Frith. Mr, Hurt's record is
a clear one in the rail road ser
vice, not a day was he suspended
durmg the time. We hope that
Mr. Hurt will be content without
workiug for a man that has beeD
actively engaged as he has, and
one that has carried the burden
and responsibility of his position
as much as Mr. Hurt did, should
be content the remainder of his
life, and be a gentleman of leis
ure. W. D. Cottengim, who has
been here for several years as
Assistant foreman, has charge of
the section, and hope that the
Dave Junior will be as successful
as the Dave Senior has been.
Mrs. W. F. Carter underwent a
serious operation at the Norton
The trousers was found some lit
tle distance from the house with
only one penny to remind the
owner that the pockets had one
time been the unsafe recepticleof
a savings bank. Mr. Keg ley, who
deals mostly in plug hordes, has
been a very successful trader, and
has conducted himself while in our
midst in such a way that he has
the respect of the entire communi
ty. He says that he has almost
sumcient prool to warrant an ar
rest, and we hope to see the guilty
party jugged in the near future.
Mrs. Mary f. Barger, mother
of Edd Barger, died at her late

ating minister, Monday morning
and immediately left for Berea
where thev will remain this week,
and return here Saturday. Their
many friends join us in wishing
them a long and prosperous wed
most seems that during Mr. Keith's
here he fell in love with the
country, or rather with some of its
inhabitants, and that it will require
a great effort of the young profes
sor to absent himself from this
vicinity long at a time. However,
Mr. Keith has many friends here
who are always glad to have him
with us. J. L. Pilkenton took his

Mt. Vernon, was here between
trains, Wednesday. C. J. Rice
has returned from Cincinnati,
aftei a few days' stay in that city.
Well, the great big convention
at Chicago, is now on. It may
be a grand meeting and a love
feast, but we predict a stormy time
as the republican party is com
posed or made up of twoelements,
viz: the G. O. P. and the Bull
Moose. We believe what will sat
isfy one will displease the other
and that there will be no harmony
(there. The tue of war lies be
tween Hughes and T R., but we
will bet a ginger cake that Roose
velt gets the nomination. But
what does it matter to us which
one gets it, lor he will only be a
lamb lor the political slaughter in
November. But just wait a few
days and there will be a meeting
at St. Louis, and a call will be
made to all quarters of the United
States, "come forth ye delegates
of the people", lets meet and
nominate by acclamation, a man
that has made the greatest Presi
dent since Garfield and Lincoln,
and then the answer will echo
back, 'Woodrow Wilson is the
man." But for fear some one
might know my politics, or my
friend at Brodhead might take is
sue with us, we will ring off and
let politics drop until after the
November election and then we
will come again and tell of the sad
departure of the Republican party
up Salt river. Mrs. G. S. Griffin
and children, after a weeks' visit
with relatives at Mt. Vernon, has
returnee" home. E. Bullock, Rock
castle and Laurels representative,
was here Saturday swopping jokes
with the citizens. We think he
is for T. R. for President, or at
least his conversation lent that
way. -W. H. Cottongin has been
repairing his property and has
repapered and treated it to a new
coat of paint. Mrs. Sallie De
borde, a relative of Mrs. Sue Mnl
lins, died a few days since at her
home in Illinois. Mrs. Deborde
has a number of relatives in this
county. C. A. Blanford has had
his property repaired by repaper
ivgand painting, and Mrs. E. H.
Cockerell has also treated her
property to a new coat of paint.
ISiews reachedS here a few days
ago of the death ot Charley Pres
ton, whom the citizens of Brodhead
and this town know well. Hobert
Griffin left a few days ago for Day
ton, Ohio. P. F. Pendergast, of
Cincinnati, who represents a firm
in that city selling Arrow brand
collars, was here Monday. We
believe he is the smallest Knight
of the Grip on the road. He is 30
years old and weighs 100 pounds.
Mrs. Roy Fenwick and children
have returned from Lebanon after
a few days' visit with relatives.-
Mr. and Mrs. Luthur Mullins, o'
Mt. Vernon, were here Tuesday bt
tween trains, en route home from

ed School here under contract has

tion at Gatliffe, ivy. Mrs. T. J.
Pennington and children, have re
turned from a few days' visit with
relatives at Mt. Vernon. Miss
Lyda Cook has returned home
after spending a few days with

here Monday. Mr. and Mrs. John
Mullins were in London latter
to improve slowly. O. V. Jarrett,
the spokeman, was here latter
part of last week loading staves
Marshal Riggs captured a de
serter of the army here, Saturday
(but we failed to get his name),
and turned him over to Deputy U.
S. Marshal George Thompson, who
took him to Fort Thomas and de
livered him over to the proper
authorities. Boys, if you don't
intend to stick to Uncle Sam, you
had better not enlist.
