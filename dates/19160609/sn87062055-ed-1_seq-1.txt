Flagstaff's first chautauquu will
begin on July 20 and continue for
seven full days, with entertainments

It is seldom that any town starts
off with such a fine program, but
those in charge have this chautauqua
fully guaranteed by the business men
and progressive citizens and they feel
confident that the venture will pay

management that it will pay better

SUGGESTS PREPAREDNESS

The undersigned, realizing as

peace that disarmament and
treaties will never give, writes
to The Sun from Williams under
the date of June 5th as follows:
I would like to make a sugges-
tion to the people of Flagstaff, if
I may. Why not have a Prcpa-
redness Parade on the 3rd or 4th
of July? I am sure the majori-
(y of the people are in favor of
preparedness. We don't have to
stand back and let the larger
cities get ahead of us, when it
comes to patriotism. Here Is the

NEW PIPE LINE TO THE
SANTA FE TANK STARTED
Water users of the town of
'! Flagstaff will be glad to learn
I that work on the new pipe line,
which is to directly connect the
Santa Fe water tank to the rcs-
crvoirs, has been started and
will be rapidly pushed to com-
pletion.
Owing to the fact that the
railroad company is almost con-
"tinually drawing water for the
big water trains run out of Flng
5 staff, the pressure on the
' city mains is not sufficient for
5 practical use to say nothing of
the needs in case of a fire.
An effort was made to have
the railroad stand some of the
expense of putting in the new
line but the best the council

from the company to stand half

The new line will follow the
course of the old line, out Le-
roux street and thence to the
reservoir, with valves placed in !
! such a way that the combined -'
force of the two lines may be
used in case of an emergency.
J The normal pressure in the !
mains is 80 to 100 ponds to the '

road is taking water the pres-
sure Is cut to 40 or 60 pounds. It
must be also remembered that
everv time a new meter is cut in
the pressure Is Hkelv to be
lessened. '
The estimated cost of the '

$14,500.00, which will be paid on i
installments out of the water

LOST 1 TOWN CHARTER
NO HEWARDJS OFFERED
At the regular meeting of the
Board of Trade held in the town hall
Wednesday the question of the town's
charter was brought up, it developed
that said charter, duly issued when
the town was incorporated, has been
mislaid and missing for several years.
In 1894 the town of Flagstaff was
incorporated by the legislature and
& charter issued, but up to date the
recording of that charter has not
been found, although it may be found
in the old records of the secretary of
state. It was suggested that a record
might be found in Yavapai county
but' this was discounted by the fact
that Coconino county was organized
in 1891, three years before.the town
was incorporated, and shows that the
charter should have been recorded in
Coconino county books.
It was moved and carried that? the
Flagstaff Board of Trade join the
! State Board of Trade and at a future
date invite that organization to hold
its annual meeting in Flagstaff in
SeDtember.
A resolution was read which is .to
be presented to the passenger agent
of the Santa Fe regarding the taking
of passengers on train No. 3 from
Flagstaff to points south and west of
( Bnrstow. The resolution pointed out
i that Winslow, Holbrook, Adamana
and other places not offering half the
attractions of Flagstaff are allowed
passengers on this train.

that the conductors on this run are
