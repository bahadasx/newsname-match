tle with the Germena off Jutland last
week had accounted for a total of 18
Carman men-of-war, and that there
waa nothing to add to or aubstract
from the original naouneement of the
British losses.
The statement gave the Carman
losses aa two betttieehips, two dread-
naught battle cruisers, four light
erulsera, nine torpedo boat deetroyer
and a submarine.
The pessimism which prevailed aa a
result of the admlraltiy'a original

the extent of the German losses, aa

Th admiralty statement declares
that th German loa.ee in the fight
were not only relatively, but absolute
ly, greater than those of th British.
Maintaining Ita practice of caution,
th admiralty still refrain from giv

ships.
The official list of the casualties
among officer show that hardly a
