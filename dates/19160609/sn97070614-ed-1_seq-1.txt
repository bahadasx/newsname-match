New Michigan State Map Has Great
Value.
A new typographical map of Michi
gan is jointly being made by the gov
ernment and the state, under an act of
the last legislature. This when finished
will show the physical character of
every acre of the state, its wood lots,
drains, roads, houses, hills, swamps,
streams, lakes and ponds, elevations,
soil character, etc. It is practically
plotting the country in preparedness
for war, for with the aid of the map tbe
military service will have in hand the
range of one given spot from another,
while the known exact physical charac
ter of the country will be of immense
value in the movements and operations
of armies.
Furthermore, it will contribute com
plete drainage data in the solution of
flood problems. Tbe work Is now going
on rapidly and engineers are at preaent
making the Saginaw county survey.

there ia going to he no trouble in

Ilea in a candidate. If a dark horae
were available, he would be named.
But there aeema to he no auch figure

The greatest hope Ilea in the oonfl.

By A. H. VANDENBERG
CHICAGO, June 8. In a tempor
ary truce toniuht between the llepub
lican and the Progressive conventions,
there is potential possibility that an
other 24 hours will produce a Repub
lican nominee whom a vast majority
of"" the Progressives .will support and
behind whom Theodore Roosevelt' will
throw the unreserved force of his
dynamic personality and power. At a
late hour, as this is being written,
threre is nothing to indicate that this
nominee will not be Justice Charles E.
Hughes. But things are happening
fast and only the last bulletins will
tell the final story.
Nearly all of the possibilities for
today prophesied in yesterday's Her
ald came true this afternoon and pro
duced the situation summed tin in the
T. R. for Party Unity.
First and most fundamentally im
portant, Roosevelt has himself spoken
in rPSnnilSP fn n fploirrnm frrtri n
... X - .v ,,. v....
I i t ii , n . ii' . i
mi mot? r oi i ue nepuoncan national
committee. He has .spoken in lofty
tone and terms which arc unmistak-
. able in their portent. They mean thaf
( the colonel wants but one party and
one ticket at the November polls,
j They mean that the colonel has no in
dention of insisting upon his own so
1 lection as the standard-bearer. They
' mean that if the Republican conven
tion nominates Hujihes or any other
candidate who measures to the neces
sities of the hour, this candidate will
have T. II. 's support. They mean that
under such circumstances, the colonel
will refuse a third party nomination
even if forced by the radical Moose
and that any third party alternative
nominations will be of smallest con
sequence. There is no mistaking this
paragraph in the message from Oyster
Hay.
"May not all having a common
Interest reunite in common effort to
save our common country? May we
ask those who have not differed
from us to join in this same spirit
toward those who have?" '
This paragraph is not only nn ap
peal to the Republican convention. It
is a mandate to the Hull Moobc.
First Move for Harmony.
Here is t lie second factor in pro
ducing the truce and the possibilities
of agreement. Th Moose themselves
offered the olive branch to the Repub
licans. At exactly 5:28 o'clock this
afternoon Chairman Harding stepped
to t lie front of the convention rostrum
with a letter in his hand.' The hour
for the first harmonizing stop had
struck and every one of the 15,000
persons in the mighty hall knew it
well. The effect was electric, hush
settled over the vast crowd. Harding
read his letter. It was n request for
a conference committee and came
from the Moose convention, which'
srnt it after Jicnring Roosevelt's mes-J
page. Spontaneously, n storm of
cheers rent th air the first real ex-:
plosion in the Coliseum. Senator

ON THE ROLL OF HONOR
Owosso Savings Bank Has Surplus
Equal to Its Capital.
Also Increases its Semi-Annaal Divi
dend to Five Per Cent.
A M.Ichlgan bank may get on the
so-called honor list by providing a
surplus that 13 equal to its capitaliz
ation. The Owosso Savings bank
achieved this distinction when, on
Monday of this week, the directors
voted to increase its surplus from
$15,000 to $50,000. Notice of this
action, sent out to the stockholders,
was accompanied by tho announce
ment that a semi-annual stock divi
dend of Ave per cent, payable June
30. had been declared. Heretofore
the semi-annual dividends have been
on the basis of four per cent.
rne Micnigan banning law re
quires state depositories to make a
showing of a surplus equal to 20
per cent of their capital stock. The
Owosso Savings bank has been carry
ing In this fund $15,000, or $5,000
more than the prescribed minimum.
By Monday's action this surplus was
more than trebled. To use a prac
tically impossible hypothesis, a sur
plus equal to the bank capital, means
that should disaster completely wipe
out the working capital of the bank,
it still would have a fund equal to
that lost, to tide it over.
The ability of the Owosso Savings
bank to thus multiply Its security, at
the same time declaring a handsome
dividend, speaks volumes of prosper
ity, thrift and careful management
Banking conditions form a reliable
criterion of a city's commercial sta
tus and thus, In the flourishing con
dition of Its banks, Owoso can find
fcause for gratification.
The stockholders of the Second
National Bank of Owosso, which with
the First National Bank, originally
transacted business in the present lo.
cation of the Owoaso Grocery com
pany and later In the present Wool-
worth store building, decided to rein
corporate under the state banking
laws and therefore, the Owosso Sav
1e?b bank had its inception in 1891.
The jbu?lness was launched auspic
iously rrid 'the' bank' has'" since made

have been many changes since that

levied by time. However, A. D.
Whipple, who began his banking ca
reer here with the national bank and
who helped to launch the state insti
tution, has served as cashier ever
since the state organization was
formed' and n large share of the cred
it for Itg present flourishing condi
tion is due to his executive efficiency,
tact and personal popularity.
Charles E. Rigley. one of the in
corporators and original directors,
now is president of tho directorate.
Mis business ability and counsel have
been of great value In directing the
bank's affairs. To him'and Mr. Whip
ple who have guided the destiny of
the bank since its infancy, the pro
gressive ?tep taken Monday Is par
ticularly ' gratifying and haa a senti
mental significance.
The present officers of tho Owosso
Savings bank are: President, Charles

for the splendid showing made include
W. M. Kilpatrick, Albert E. Hartshorn
and George T. Mason, each of whom
gave carefnl attention to the affairs of
the bank during their years of service
and whose counsel and advice was al

In referring to tbe action of the Bank
tbe Argus says:
Edmund O. Uewey, while not one
of the original directors, has been
associated with the institution in
that capacity for some years. His
business associates of the bank speak
in terms of praise of his loyalty and
his devotion of time and well direct
ed energy to the unraveling of per
plexities incident to the conduct of
any business of this nature and mag
nitude. Elks to Observe Flag Day
I i Flag day will be observed by Owosso

Congregational church, and the singing
cf patriotic songs by the audience. The

believing that a short program would

A marriage of interest to many in
this city was that of Miss Nellie Wes
cott, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Frank
Wescott of Detroit, to Mr. Herman
Pigott, also of Detroit.
The ceremony was performed on
Wednesday at the bride's home and
was a quiet affair because of the seri
ous condition of the bride's mother.
The young people will make their home
in Detroit.
Daring the Wescott3 residence in this
city they made many friends who ex
tend congratulations. Miss Wescott is
unusually gifted as a singer. Ths
