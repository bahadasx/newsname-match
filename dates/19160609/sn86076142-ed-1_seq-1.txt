CONFEREES MEET, BUT NO REPORT READY
I Br Aaaaelated lre. I
CIIICAliO, Juiifi !. ThrouifhiMit. both kosk'iouh today of the Pfo
gresHivf convention the fear watt apparent that the RepublieaiiK
would reach the nomination of Roosevelt before the Progressives
could. It WU8 understood that Senator Kail of New Mexico, was
patiently waiting im the Hepuhlican convention until it came time
for him to arise and place the colonel's name in nomination.
"The radical" element of the Progressives seemed largely res
ponsible for the so called "Koosevelt drive," which apparently per
meated the convention.
The conservative element however seemed willing to await fur
ther action on the part of the Republicans.
HUGHES' NAME PIRST
PUT IN NOMINATION
(By Associated Pre.)
t'HK'AUO, June 9. After adoption of a platform with only
minor ehanges the Republican convention proceeded with nominations,
Hughes' name being first presented by Whitman, who was frequently
interrupted. One remark caused a six minute demonstration when
he mentioned Tuft 'a name.
Previously to the beginning of nominations the convention heard
the peace conferees report which was noncommittal, although con
taining mention of Roosevelt.
The Hughes nomination was swiftly followed by that of Root,,
by Butler; Rurton, by Willis, and Weeks, by Lodge. Each name
caused a demonstration, that for Hurton being confined principally'
to Ohio. It was stated the convention planned to take two ballots
before recessing, but it was not believed the nomination would be.
made until late, if today.
NOMINATION OF BURTON , . . -The
first nomination was that of Rurton placed forward as the
man "loved by his friends, feared by his antagonists and respected I
by all." ,
. "It is no longer disparagement of any of the eminent Republi
cans who are candidates before this convention," said Gov. Frank IV
Willis, of Ohio. "When 1 say that no man in America is better fitted.'
for the high office of president by natural ability, by breadth of vision,
by wide acquaintance with world-problems, by successful experience
by high purpose and lofty character than is Ohio's candidate.
In obedience to the command of a united party in our state and
voicing the unanimous sentiments of her delegation, I present for youi-i
consideration Ohio's choice for the presidency that scholar, leader,
HtateHiiian, that citizen of the world with another we can win, with,
him we cannot fail. I nominate for the office of president of thei
Tinted States, Theodore K. Hurton."
NOMINATION OF WEEKS
John Wingate Weeks, of Massachusetts, was nominated by Sena
tor Lodge as a candidate who will command 'support beyond the
strict limits of the party and receive it from all men who sympathize
with our purposes. "We must have a man who is in thorough ac
cord with Republican principles." said Senator Lodge. Our candi
date must be a man who believes in the protection of American rights
by land and sea and who will maintain an honest and real neutrality.
We must have a man who believes
tection of American interests, who is American through and through.
Such a man, in every fibre of his being, is the candidate I present to
you.

The second session today began shortly after three o'cloek with
the delegates more cheerful owing probably to the appearance of the
sun which has remained hidden since the convention began.
Reading of the platform was concluded and within. a short time
it was believed it would be approved without important changes.
Rapid nomination speeches at the Republican convention placing
various favorite sons names before the body were followed With in
terest by the Progressive leaders.
The reading of the two final planks in the Progressive platform
calling for a leader "who acts" caused a wave of Roosevelt enthu
siasm lasting many minutes.
BORAH GOES VISITING
MAY BE COMPROMISE
(By Associated Press.) i "
t'UH'AtlO, June 9. The Progressive convention completed con
sideration of the platform section by section, but without voting on
final adoption. A conference committee is understood to be watching
the situation to determine whether there is any further use to try
to get together with the Republicans. This will depend, it is under
stood, whether the latter proceed to nominations or desired further,
parleys. .
During the session Horah visited and made a speech which is
regarded by the delegates to be a sign of "a friendly spirit between
the conventions." Perkins said he could mt know what signifi
cance was attached to the visit.
Some leaders suggested that Horah might be the compromise
nominee suggested by the Republicans in their conference report.
Later the leaders conferred on the course to be followed by the con
vention should it -decide to be regulated by the action uf the Re
publicans. Throughout the session frequent references 'to Roosevelt
caused storms of applause and shouts, "we want Teddy.'!
The conferees agreed that if the Republicans would not make
the nomination the Progressives would transact other routine business.

in the nineties, whereas even before
the war the expenses of most compan

bably will rise even more after the
war. A decided deterioration of all
Hues is to be expected, the resolutions
point out, unless they are allowed to
raise prices to 16 pfennigs (3 cents).
