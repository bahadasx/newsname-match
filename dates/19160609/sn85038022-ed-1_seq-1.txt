Clilcaro. Jun 9 Tho conferees of
tho llfitdb!lMi nnd Progressives par-
tits adjourned at 12:30 a. ni. niter n
two-hour eesIon with tho announco
mcn: that they would not meet again
until after the nesslon of tho two con
vention ttnoifow. Tho only state
ment clvcn out was:
'Wo mpcrt progress."
Tht ctinfeittR woro unanimous In
asscrtlug that rhe conference was en
tirely harmonious. Discussion of
caiblli'tUes followed Just two lines.
The 1 Miumtivefl talked only about
Colonel flooscvolt; tho nepnbllcan
conffrccc supgested tho name of var
ious favorite eons. Including Fair
banks, llurton, Itoot Hughes nnd oth
ers, hut reachod no unanimous decis
ion that they-favored any one of them
nbovo tho other. Tho entire rango of
dldcusslon, it was said, never not be
yond generalities.
While l.tth sides reported "prog
ress," the Republicans appeared to
take a more optimistic view of the
situation than somo of the Progres
sives, otncnp whom there was far
from a unanimity of opinion that an
agreement 'mis probable.
Will llcport to CotncnllotiH
U was agreed that the conferees
should report to their reapectlvo con
ventions at all sure that tnc conven
tlon which Is represented could be
controlled. It was understood that
three ballots would bo taken In the
rtennbllcan convention, and If without
result, there should bo a further con
ference tomorrow night. If, however,
as might vory likely bo tho case, clth
or or both conventions should make
a nomination today, all further ucgo
flattens would be Impossible.
The conference was hold at the
Chicago Club, to which tho Republican
conferees preceded tho Progressives
Gtorgo W. Perkins, Governor Johnson,
Horace Wilkinson and other Progres
sive leaders conferred at .Mr. Perkins'
headquarters, whoro tho long distance
wlro to Oyster Day Is located, until
almost 10 o'clock last night and then
left for tho club.
Situation Is Summed lrp
At tho end of the session of the con
ferees, one of the conferees summed
ud tho situation in this way.
"Wc all agreed not to discuss the
details of our meeting until reports
aro mado to our respective conven
tions today. I can say this, however;
It has not changed tho situation In
respect to tho probablo nomination of
Hughes by the Republicans, a situa
tlon had been created by which the
Progressives will, In njl probability,
be willing to postpono tho deBtre of
tho radical members to rusn into a
nomination of Colonel Hoosovclt for
tho solo purpose of being tho first to
put a ticket in tho field.
"There was absoluto harmony, so
far as our personal rolatlons were
concerned, and I believo wo made for
good fooling regardless of whether we
accomplished tho main purposo of
coming together or not."
The acceptance by both conventions
of the poace conferonco proposal
threw tho situation into a new uncer
tainty. Hughes supporters and many
other Republican leaders feel that
it can not provent tho nomination of
the Justice, but tho development has
had the effect of holding off the ex
pected crystallization upon Justice
Hughes In tho Republican convention.
The Progressive convention reas
sembles this morning at 10 o'clock and
the Republican at 11 o'clock.
HOOSEVELT ASKS l'AKTIES TO
JOIN
Oyster Day, N. Y., Juno 8 Colonel
Theodoro Roosevelt today issuod an
appeal to the Progrcsslvo and Repub
lican conventions at Chicago to for
get their past differences and Join "for
the safety and honor of our country
to enforce tho policy of gonulno Amer
icanism and gonulno preparedness."
He was ready, he said, to go to Chi
cago and address tho Republican con
vention desired It.
Ho assailed President Wilson as
having rendered "tho most evil serv
ice that can get rendered to a great
democracy," and declared that It was
for tho convention to show tho peoplo
"that they have a worthy altornatlvo
to which to turn."
Ho charged that "professional German-Americans"
were sooklng to ter
rorize tho Republican convention and
that they wished to olect as President
"a victory to a forolgn government."
The appeal was contained In a mes
sage to formor Senator William D.
Jackson, of Maryland, Republican Na
tional Committeeman, in reply to the
letters of Invitation to tho Colonel to
come to Chicago.
FAIRBANKS BOOSTERS FOJICIJO

FIRE TAllADE
Chicago, June 8 Rainy weather has
not dampened the ardor of tho Fair
banks boosters In the loast, but it did
servo to causo a postponement of the
Fairbanks street parade, which had
been planned for tonight. Flroworks
and rain don't go together, so It was
decided to delay tho rod-Ore demon
stration until tomorrow night
One hundred of tho Fairbanks boost
tors Invaded the lobby of tho Auditor
ium this ovcnlng and shouted with all
their might for the Indiana candidate,
while tho Progressives assembled
thoro took un tho cry for "Toddy".
The battlo of campaign yolls, while
noisy, wan entirely friendly.
Tho Roosevelt followers are friend
ly enough to the Indiana man and
they aro proposing Falrbunks for tho
Mce-presldonoy. Tho Indiana men,
however, reply that Fairbanks ought
to bo satisfactory to tho Progressive
element for president or they aro will
Ins to urgo him for second place.
