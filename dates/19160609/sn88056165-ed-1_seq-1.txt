The citizens of Cottonwood
and the visitors who were taking
in the big free picnic of the farm
ers union at this place yesteaday
were treated to one of the best
exhibitions of the national game
that has been played on the local
grounds, or the two prairies for
that matter, in several seasons
when they witnessed the local
team win from the fast Ferdi
nand team after nine innings^.of
as fast ball as one could care'* to
see. The visitors came unde
feated champions of tP* two
prairies, having lost only one
game this season and that to a
team which they defeated last
Sunday b y an overwhelming
score.
The game was called at 4
o'clock with Ferdinand at bat
and for seven innings not a sin
gle batter succeeded in getting
around the bases. Cottonwood
had three men on bases with only
one man out at different times
during the first half of the game
but ÿoung Adkison tightened up
and succeeded in retiring the
nex# two batters, thus getting
out of a deep hole. In the
seventh inning Cottonwood had
a fine chance to Bcore the first
run of the game. Hussman got
around to third, with one man
out. The next batter hit to
pitcher and Ahe runner, being
over anxious to score, whs tagged
out at home. The next batter
hit one to èecond so hard it could
not be handled, which would
have been an easy score had
Hussman remained on third.
As it was the game went into
the eighth inning without a score
having been made by either team
and it looked as if extra innings
would have to be played to de
cide the contest. In this inning
John Fry was the first batter up
and hit a fast one to the pitcher
that could not be recovered in
time and he was safe at first.
Haener then connected with one
of Rusty's slants for a three
bagger to deep left field, scoring
Fry. Swartz then flew out to
center and Haener scored on the
t'hrow-in. Ben Fry went out by
the shortstop to first route, Ad
kison hit safe to short but Hay
den was put out at first and re
tired the side. For Cottonwood,
Fred Lange struck out. Rooke
walked and stole second. Maugg
hit safe to center, scoring Rooke.
Maugg was canght napping at
second. Bieren hit to left field
for two bases and stole third.
Hussman fanned.
In the ninth only four batters
faced Rusty and but one of these
succeeded in reaching first. For
Cottonwood, Schober failed thrice
to locate the ball. Rusty hit a
safe drive to right field. Geo.
Lange hit a safe on to right and
Rusty took third. Kaasa drove a
line drive into left field and Rusty
scored, tieing the score. F
was out on three strikes. Rooke
then came to bat with a do or
die expression on his face and
smashed a wicked drive at the
pitcher that could not be handled
and Lange scored the run that
won the game.
Probably 700 people witnessed
the game and all expressed the
opinion that it was one of the
best seen on the prairie for many
days. The Ferdinand team put
up gilt edge ball from start to
finish and showed that they are
entitled to the victories won this
Young Adkison is devel
>ing into a pitcher of real merit
, with the experienced catcher
to hold him down, will get
better as the season progresses.
He was credited with a total of
fifteen strike-outs yesterday,
yhidf is some record for a boy of
his age. Rusty was decidedly off
color yesterday, his arm being
very sore from the effects of last
Sunday's garnie, and it was only
good judgment and excellent
backing that won him the game.
Rooke caught him in fine shape
and when both are in trim they
will make a battery to be reck
oned with.
The score by innings was as
follows:
Ferdinand 00000002 0—2
Cottonwood 00000001 2—3
The Ilo team will play at this
place next Sunday and the Voll
mer team the following Sunday.
Ferdinand will play at Kamiah
Sunday and it is more than prob
able that Ferdinad and Cotton
wood will play again at Ferdi
nand during the celebration.
Farmers' Picnic Big Success
Several hundred persons from
the surrounding country and
near-by towns took in the big
free picnic given here yesterday
by the local farmers union and
all expressed themselves as be
ing highly pleased with the day's
entertainment and hoped that
the occasion might become an
annual event. The Denver
band was on the street early in
the day to dispense sweet music
to the crowd and was quite liber
al with its selections. At ten
o'clock the crowd went to the
warehouse where the program
was carried out, consisting of
speeches, music and singing.
At noon a big free basket picnic
dinner was-spread on tables ar
ranged for the purpose, the
union providing free steaming,
hot coffee to wash down the eat
ables. After dinner small sports
held sway until near four o'clock
when the crowd repaired to the
ball park to witness the fast
game between the Ferdinand
and Cottonwood teams. In the
evening a free play was given at
the K. C. hall, after which danc
ing held sway until well into the
morning hours. The big hall
was crowded to overflowing both
for the play and dance and twice
the floor space could have been
used to advantage. Many peo
ple who could not get away from
their duties during the day mo
tored over in the evening from
Grangeville, Nezperce, Ilo-Voll
mer and Ferdinand for the show
and dance and the tojwn was
filled with cars and merry crowds
of happy girls and boys out for a
good time.
The big picnic jms certainly a
success in every sense of the
word and the members of the
union are to be congratulated in
carrying out the affair so suc
cessfully. After such a brilliant
start, the public will feel disap
pointed if the picnic is not made
an annual affair.
Convict Escaped
One of the honor convicts at
the road* camp at White Bird
made his get-away Sunday night
and up to the present time has
not been aoÂh|tded. He was
a MexicandBoian sent up from
the \:oyrifA around Spaulding
and had but^ short time to serve.
His capture is but a matter of a
short time as he is a man easily
identified and his foolishness will
result in several years more add
ed to his sentence.—Free Press.
Mrs. W. B. Hussman was a
Ferdinand visitor Wednesday.
F. J. Miller, cashier of the Ilo
bank, and Mr. Wunder were visi
the city yesterday.
The Game.
When the game seems lost, and you want to quit,
And you're sticking just by your nerve and grit,
And you can't see an earthly chance to win,
And you're weary and jaded and near "all in,''
Don't ever quit as you want to do,
But keep your heart till the game is through,
Till the last hard minute is passed and gone—
Fight—on !
The chaps who win are the boys with pluck,
Who never will quit till the gong is struck,
And many and many a game they play
Is won at the end of a losing day—
Won by sticking the struggle out—
Won by going the whole long route,
While they, though weary in brain and brawn—
Fight—on !
So though you're staggering, weak and blind,
Battered in body and dazed in mind,
You can't be sure that the other side—
In spite of its front of strength and pride—
May not be tired and jaded too,
And fully as near "all in" as you!
You brace and rally, their triumph's gone—
, Fight—on !
—Selected.
CONVICTS HOID
OP FARMER
Escaped Criminals Visited the
Pierce Ranch Yesterday and
Held Up Owner With Guns
—Officers Now In Pursuit.
a
This town was treated to quite
a bit of excitement yesterday
aside from the picnic features
and ball game when word was
phoned into town during the af
ternoon that the two convicts
who escaped the first of the week
from the honor camp near White
bird had held up M. A. Pierce
and hired man at the Pierce farm
northwest of town. Davis and
Smead* the escapes, were seen
near the MacMaster farm north
of town shortly after noon and
word was at once sent to Grange
ville to the sheriff. The officer
and a deputy soon arrived by
auto and swore in several extra
men as deputies at this place and
the posse, left in autos toi try to
locate the convicts. They ran
out north into the Ferdinand
seption without getting any trace
of the men, then swung éast into
the Greencreek district and back
again to this place. Before they
returned to town word had been
phoned into town by Mr. Pierce
that the men had been at his
place and another posse was
formed and started out to locate
the escapes.
The convicts appeared at the
Pierce ranch about one o'clock
and proceeded to ransack the
house while the owner was in
the field, Mrs. Pierce and little
son having gone to the Eckert
farm to spend the day. When
Mr. Pierce and his hired man,
Joe Seyller, came to the house
the convicts held them up at the
point of guns and forced them to
good dinner for them. During
meal time the phone rang and the
convicts answered it and tried to
palm themselves off as the owner
but failed. They then allowed
Mr. Pierce to answer the phone
but one held the receiver While
the other held a gun against Mr.
Pierce's back until the conversa
tion was completed. After din
ner Mr. Pierce was required to
put up food enough to last the
men two or three .days, after
which they decided to get some
sleep, one man guarding while
the other slept Mr. Pierce talked
with them coolly and said he had
lots of work to do and did not
care to be held idle in the house.
He was finally allowed to go to
his work near, Seyller being kept
at the house, and the convict on
guard watching both men. Mr.
Pierce was clearing up some
brush from a creek and hauling
it out onto higher ground. He
gradually worked down with his
team into the creek bottom until
out of sight of the house, when
he dropped the" lines and ran
down the gulch to the Puthoff
'farm and phoned into town for
help.
As soon as the convict on guard
learned that Pierce had got away
he aroused his companion and,
taking their food supply, a couple
boxes of cartridges and a suit be
longing to Mr. Pierce, theo disap
peared into the 1 timber. In the
meantime the posse had gone out
from this place and the sheriff
and his men soon returned to
town and were put on the right
trail and the man-hunt continued
continued thrdughout the night
but up to the time of going to
press the men had not been lo
cated.
While at the Pierce farm the
convicts admitted their identity
but said they would never be
taken back to Boise. They said
they were desperate and would
kill anyone who tried to take
them. They were well armed
with rifles taken from a store at
Whitebird, had several boxes of
shells, and with the extra shells
secured at the Pierce place, will
be able to put up a hard battle if
surrounded.
Deputy Sheriff Bill Eller, who
so successfully rounded up a bad
man in the Salmon river country
some weeks ago, came over from
Grangeville this morning and is
now on the trail of the fugitives.
It is thought the men escaped
down the river from Whitebird
by boat and landed near the
mouth of Deep creek and were
trying to make their way across
into the Bitter Root mountains
and later into Montana. On be
ing discovered north of town
they probably changed their
plans and will no doubt remain
in the timbered country until
captured oa they succeed in mak
ing good their escape.
