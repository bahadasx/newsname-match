J. H. HANSON,
Clean-up Week.
Harland Barnes, aged 8, grade
IV May 3, 1916.
I think that clean-up week should
be a week when people clean things
up. Things need to be picked up
and old papers, sticks and stones,
and things that look bad.
One thing I think improves . the
looks of a town, is planting a lot of
trees. I certainly think that spitting
on the streets doesn't improve the
looks of a town.
If six garbage cans were put near
the station, near some stores and
one on each corner of the four streets
It would help to keep things neater
Women should have their windows
washed once a month, and should
have their houses painted once in two
years.
Microbes breed in places where it
is dirty. Flies walk all over gar
bage cans and get all over the food,
Sometimes papers scare horses and
it sometimes results in serious in
juries.
With feelings of much regret do
we announce the death of Mrs. Mich
ael Blanchette, who suddenly passed
from our midst Monday, May 29th.
Although she had been in ill health
for some years past she had recently
been feeling better than usual, and
death coming so suddenly was a
great shock to the community in
which she was much beloved, and a
still greater loss to her husband, who
was prostrated by her sudden death.
Lousia L. McGookin, being her
maiden name, was born in Stan
stead, P. Q., June 2d, 1849, and in
that same town was united in mar
riage to Michael Blanchette Oct.
12th, 1884, and immediately removed
to Island Pond where they have ever
since resided, and where Mr. Blanch
ette carried on an extensive tailoring
business till a few years ago.
Mrs. Blanchette was a person
possessed of a kind and motherly
disposition and though never blessed
with childien, always insisted upon
some of her young nieces or nephews
remaining with her while in their in
fancy and in whose company she
took great delight.
For the past six or seven years her
health had been such that it was
necessary for her to spend her win
ters in a milder climate, and she
therefore resided with a favorite
niece, Mrs. (Dr.) G. G. Desy of Mill
bury, Mass., from whose home she
had just left on May 16th. When
spring came she would return home
again, pleased to see her old friends
who would in turn make her doubly
welcome. This time she returned
home, apparently as well as usual,
and attended mass Sunday, May
28th. That night she retired as us
ual, but during the night was seized
with a fainting spell and although
medical attendance was at' hand it
was of no avail, for within a few mo'
ments she had passed to the great
beyond.
Although she will be 'greatly
missed by her many friends, of whom
she had a large circle, much sympa
thy is extended to her bereaved hus
band, who, on.account of their great
affection for each other, will have to
bear the greatest loss of all.
Funeral services were held Wednes
day, May 31st, at the church of St.
James the Greater, Rev. Fr. C. D
Trottier officiating, with interment
in the new Catholic cemetery. The
funeral was under the management
Lof W. A. Gleeson. Pall bearers, W
J. Rooney, T. C. Tracy, F. Paquette
and E. Robin, old friends of the de
ceased, carried her to her last rest
ing place.
The ladies of St. Anne's Society
attended in a body at the church
besides a large number of friends
The many beautiful floral offerings
that surrounded the remains testl
fled to the esteem in which she was
held by all who had the pleasure of
knowing her.
Among those from out of town
who attended the funeral were Mrs
G. G. Desy of Millbury, Mass., niece
of the deceased, and Mr. Blanch
ette's sister, Miss Blanchette of St
Hyacinthe, P. Q.
