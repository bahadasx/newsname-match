TffE PROGRESS OF THE WAR
The greatest naval battle of history.
The sinking of the battle cruiser
"Hampshire" with all on board, includ
ing Lord Kitchener and his staff.
^The death of the emperor:president of
China.
A heavy battle near Ypres between
Germans and Canadians.
The beginning of the great Russian
drive again9t the Teutons.
The topics listed ni^ke the past week
more full of stirring and exciting news
than any other week of the war and per
haps in some ways in history. We are
writing on Wednesday and there is still
time
for
remarkaDle
things before
x'
and unexpected
we
go to press.
The greatest naval tattle of history
which was fought week ago Wednesday,
except as to general results, still lacks in
details. Both sides claim advantage,
but so far losses in men and ships ap
pear nearly equal with perhaps theheav
lest to the British But as we say in
another article strategically. the r$spec
tive fleets are as before, the German
fleet in harbor and the English fleet in
the North Sea. The survivjrs of the
sunken ships are very few. When a
ship went down it became the coffin of
all her officers and crew. Many of these
ships carried from 500 to 1000 men of
whom practically all were drowned. The
unken vessels must have carried
from eight to ten thousand sailors to the
bottom, while in the crippled ships and
the others there n.ust also been many
killed and wounded by gunfire.
While both fleets will feel the loss of
many tine ships the greatest loss is in
men and officers. Ships can be built in
a comparatively short time, but sailors
even more than soldiers are not easily
replaced. It takes years of growth and
experience to make sailors. Relatively
of course England can spare her ships
and sailors better than Germany as her
force is so much larger.
While details are as yet not available,
and it will perhaps be many weeks be
fore we learn the whole story, the fight
was a long drawn out affair beginning
with smaller craft about four in the af
ternoon and these smaller oraft gradual
Ij reinforced as the hours want on
by
the larger and heavier craft. the enemy.

In the beginning the German fleet was
apparently the strongest while later
British reinforcements would appeSr to
have overbalanced the odds. At least
6 ie latter part of tbe fight appears to
have be«n running one, in which the re
treating Germans had the opportunity
of dropping floating mines in the way of
the pursuing English and this may ac
count for the loss of-some of the latter.
Tuesday night's telegrams gave the
news of the sinking df the battle cruiser
'"Hampshire" near the Orkney Islands
with all on board which included Earl
Kitchener and his staff who were on
their way to Russia. Pour boats were
seen to leave the sinking ship but as
none have shown up it is probable that
the cause and the story of the sinking
will never be known, though it is pro
bable that it was a mine or a torpedo.
It is probable that if Germany had the
opportunity of selecting a victim from
the English she would have chusen
Kitchener. It is also probable that the
English people believe that they could
have spared one of *heir commanders bet
ter than Lord Kitchener. Though he
had been subjected to strong criticism
by a part of the British press yet he was
the great popular hero of the English
populace.
The battles about Verdun during the
the last of the week were particularly
furious and bloody and perhaps the most
sanguinary of that blood soaked area.
The Germans made some slight gains in
area as a result, but the French claim
that the gains were very costly.
Potrograd claims considerable advance
on the long lines against the Teutons
What this movemeat will amount to is
still a question. If the Russians are
successful it might make a difference
along the Franco-Belgian frontier, and
it is probably the movement was instit
uted for that purpose.
Italy started to invade Austria in three
different places at the beginning of the
war. For some time they made some
progress over the mountains but later it
seems like a deadlock and the latest
news is thnt while the Italians still claim
orogress along two of the assaulting
columns that the third column has been
driven backwards by the Austrians.
The rebellion in China it is said will
close with the death of Youan Shi Kai
who died of stomach trouble on Tues
dao. His successor the vice president is
said to be in favor with the rebels.
While there is nothing of special itn
portance from Mexico it becomes mure
and more evident that Carranza only
lacks the power to expel tbe grigoes'
from Mexican territory. It is also be
coming more and more certain that it
will be up to the United States sooner
or later to change the present "Mie-i-co,"
to the normal Mexico and that only the
United States can do it.
THE GREAT NAVAL BATTLE.
''The greatest naval action in history
has been fought during the last week.
There were many unique features in the
fight, but nothing decisive as to naval
values and weapons. All the arms of
the new naval warfare were present but
as the greater part of the battles was
fought in darkness or semi-darkness the
elements of chance must have been large
factors in results. At this writing there
are no definite tidings as to the whole
number of ships engaged during the
different phases of the action which seems
to have begun about four in tbe after
noon and lasted until daylight next
morning, but it is certain that measured
in guns, tons and men, there has been
nothing in history like it.
The greatest wonder is that with such
great fleets sailing around in the dark
ness bow it was possible to fight with
any degree of intelligence, how they
could distinguish friend or foe, why they
did not ram each other unintentionally,
aAd how oould the^r aim at invisible or
partly invisible ships? Of course all these
ships had searohlights but to display a
searchlight waa to iaivite tbe guafire 6f
lil&l
P!S" »•?&"•::-.>*
As tonaval question p, it would
that given enough torpedo boats'
submarine* wjlling to be sacritioed, and
darkness and fog as allies then the
super«dre&dnought with itB biggunSand
protective armor can be sunk by. the
smaller craft. Whether the same craft
would be successful in broad daylight is
still a question.
As to results between the wsrring na
tions there appears no advantage of
moment to either side. Both sides sflf
fred Rleat losses of men and sbipp, and
both sides are strategically just where
they were before.
It is but a repetition of.the trench fight*
ing on land. So many men killed and
wounded, a few meters gained or
and the murder goes on as before
When will end? Only one thing are we
sure of—that with the awful loss of life
and the expenditure of ammunition the
end must come soon. a#
CLEAN-UP-J)AYS.
It is customary in moat towns to have
"clean-up" days in which the general
public participate in cleaning up other
wise neglected places, etc. The under
lying idea is good not only for tbe practi
cal results but also because of the edu
eating influences. It is true that if
''every man swept before his own door
that tnere would be little need of such
.general endeavor.' In that case every
day would be clean-up day and every
day the town would be clean.
It is a peculiar fact that there are
-many people who do not know how to
get and keep dean. Sometimes it may
be down-right .laziness but more often it
'is lack of a bump of order. We khow
persons right in this little city that are
not lazy, that putter long and often
around their yards—yes, and in their
dwellings—and yet things never appear
-as they should.
Some homes are "homey'' and appeal
to the visitor as such, while other dwell
ings, perhaps with far more costly fur
niture, are apparently cold and forbid
ding with an excess of order or a confusion
-of disorder, and as a rule the out door
premises are of the same fashion.
But imitation does a great deal to
keep this helpless class. There is many
a man—and woman—keeps home and
and home surroundings quite passable
just because there is a near neighbor
who,perhaps unwitting shows them how
Fortunately there are some persons who
are inherently neat, but the most of
mankind are naturally of the e^,^
earthy. Put one of the former class
away out in tbe forest or on thevjpen
prairie to make a home far from civili
zation and soon, though perhaps rude
and few, there are attempts.for order and
even ornament. Put. one of the latter
class in a similar position and poseibly
he will neglect to wash his own face.
—because there is no one else to see him.
A great part of our ideas of order and
cleanliness are promoted by imitation
and desire of approbation from others.
Naturally, we are "dirty boys". Ilsnce
the va'ue of "clean up" days.
THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.
As we write the delegates to the
national Republican convention tre as
sembled at Chicago to
•f 'J.
J-4-
choose
Most correspondents agree that Hugh
es h$s the most votes both as first and
second choice that Roosevelt has suffi
cient strength to say who shall or shall
not be nominated though his own candi
dacy is doubtful. Then there area large
number of votes scattered among favor
ite "sons". A deadlock as between
Hughes, Roosevelt and the scattered
"sons" might result that about the third
or fourth ballot if no choice was made,
that the "sons" might be abandoned and
second choice carry the convention for
Hughes, or perchance combine on some
one of the "sons" and thus surprise the
country.
So far we only know that they'are all
honorable men and the convention will
make no great mistake whomsoever is
selected. That is and has been for many
years a great difference between'the two
parties. Tbe democrats can usually find
but one man in their party who is fit for
a
president while the
republioanB
gener­
ally have a score of men who would
make good presidents.
