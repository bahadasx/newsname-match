A POOR CROP OUTLOOK.
Massachusetts crop conditions aro
not radically different from those in
other parts of New England, nnd for
that reason thcro will be general in
terest hereabouts in tho statement of
tho sccretnry of tho Mnssachuseotts
board of agriculture that the loss in
crops this year will probably average
$5 an aero over 1,000,000 acres of inv
proved land in that stne. Tho princl
pal cause for this dubious crop out
look is said to bo the exceptionally
late spring witli its excessive rainfall.
The difliculty began witli tho long,
Into winter, snow rcmniniiig into
April, thus dolaying frost from com
ing out of the ground nnd preventing
tho ground from drying out. Then
came the heavy and quito' constant
rains, dolaying planting still further.
especially on low lands. Reports re
ccivoj from many sections of Massa
chusetts aro generally to the effort
that the season is fro.n two to three
weeks lato and that in many instances
seeds havo rotted in tho ground and
n second planting hns been necessary
But this is not the only difficulty
that tho farmers havo had to face
Tho labor problem is growing moro
and moro serious. Both tho market
gardeners near the largo cities nnd
tho farmers in the mpro rural district
report that it is almost Impossible to
hiro help. The only result is that in
such instances the farmers aro not
planting the ordinary crops, although
they havo no difliculty in finding a
ready market for almost anything
thoy can raise. The fertilizer situa
tion is by no means pleasing. Nitrato
of soda is very scarce and potash can
not be bought, because of tho war.
Even if the weather conditions and
the labor situation had been good this
spring the farmer would havo had a
hard row to hoe. Last year was a bad
ono for agriculturists, duo principally
to tho dry spring and tho heavy rains
which followed in July nud August.
Mnny farmers carried over debts from
last year and somo of them hnve
been unable even to pay thoir seed nnd
fertilizer bills of HU5. Consequently,
thoy feel unable to go nhcad contract
ing .noro debts, in somo instances oven
being unublo to do so.
Largo growers of corn say that the
planting has been unsatisfactory. This
is especially truo wliero tho seed has
been planted on heavy land. In such
instances tho seed has como up very
irregularly and replanting has boon
necessary. Somo farmers, however,
who have high, sandy land havo had
hotter success. Tho planting of oarly
peas has not been very encouraging,
Tho crop generally is exceptionally
late because tho ground is so cold
The asparagus crop is tho poorest in
years, duo to the cold weather.
Reports from tho Connecticut valley
arc to the effect that tho onions aro
doing well. This is a crop that can
stand considerable water. It is too
early yet to make any statement with
regnrd to tho outcome of tho tobacco
crop in that section. The strnwborry
crop is promising. Thcro was a heavy
blow, and tho berries nro forming
well.
Tho hay crop promises to bo ono of
tliu best in yenrs, providing, of course,
that tlio harvest is dry and fair. It
hns been an 'exceptionally good season
for dairying. Tho pastures ovory
whero aro grcon, tho cattlo having all
the grass they can eat. aeuorally
speaking, green i feeding in tho barn
is unneccessary.
Tho apple crop promises to bo good
Seldom has thoro boon a hotter bloom
than this spring.
Wheat harvesters arc badly needed
in Kansas, whero tho season opens
.Tune 18. Employment for from 35,000
o -10,000 men at wages from $2 to $7
a day is causing eastern labor bureaus
to issue appeals in behalf of tho wheat
growers. It is doubtful, however,
whether New England will contributo
much help toward tho wheat harvest
this year. Thcro nro too many oppor
tunities for steady work at good wag
es right hero at homo to mako a tem
porary position m the middlo west al
luring. Farmers in this section aro
already complaining about tho scar
city of help, due in. considerable meas
ure, doubtless, to tho activities ot in
dustrial concerns with big orders
ahead.
Tho Greater Vermont association
lias been given permission to uso the
walls of the Montpclier hotels for a
display of photographs of Vermont
during tho association's annual meet
ng in that city July 12 and 13. This
is a good idea, and it brings to mind
an inquiry why tho hotels of tho stato
do not make greater uso of Vermont
views as a continuous advertisement.
Too many hotel offices contain pictures
showing the beauty of somo spot in
Canada or tho Vnr West instead of
viows of tho scenic attractioa of their
own neighborhood. Thoro isil't a ho
tel in this part of Vermont tljatnceds
to go moro than n, tow nmos irum us
front door to find material for the
most beautiful photographs .imagin
able, and if tho home scenes wero

chances aro that moro guests would

as so many of them -do, in pursuit of
somo distant beauty spot.
Hughes Probable Choice of Republicans
While Roosovolt Dominates Bull
Mooso Desiro for Unity of Parties.
The Republican nnd Progressive national
conventions have been in session in
Chicago since Wednesday noon, but no
nominations have been made yet and it
was not believed last night that action
would lie taken before tomorrow. The
situation is a peculiar one in thnt the
Kcpiiblicnu convention seems likely to
nominate Justice Charles E. Hughes and
the riogrcssives arc bound to name lheo-
dorc Roosevelt although both factions of
what was onco tho G. O. P. have gone on
record in favor of harmony and co-operation.
Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio
delivered tho keynote spcccli at tho Re
publican convention, making a stiong pica
for pnity lcunion and urging the need of
a return to Republican principles in gov
ernment administration. The speech
created a favorable impression, but it
aroused none of the enthusiasm that was
evident in the Progressive convention
when Temporary Chairmnn Raymond
Itobins of Chicago mentioned tho name of
Kooscvclt nnd was obliged to wait an
hour and 33 minutes before the demon
stration censed.
In an cfTort to prevent a split in the
Republican ranks this year leaders of both
conventions aie trying to bring about the
tiominntion of a candidate who will io
unite the parties. With this end in view
Col. Roosevelt has been urged to leave
the seclusion of Oyster Bay and go to
Chicago. Yesterday afternoon he inndo
the statement that he would be willing
to address the Republican party conven
tion if it wished him to do so. Although
ho has not made a definite statement to
Miat cllect Col. Rooi-evelt is believed to be
opposed to the nomination of Justice
Hughes.

EARL KITCHENER DROWNED.
British War Minister on Way to Russia'
When Warship Sunk Off Orkney Is
lands Monday Night.
With his entire staff, en route on
an important mission to Russia, Lord
Kitchener, secretary or war, was
drowned when tho British cruiser
Hampshire was sunk off tho nest
Orkney Islands, north of Scotland,
about 8 o'clock Monday night, "by a
mine or torpedo," as Sir John Jelllcn,
commander of Britain's grand licet, of
ficially reported. Lvery oiheer and
ninn on tho Hampshire, an 11,000-ton
cruiser, was lost. Accompanying Kitch
ener there wore, besides tho members
of his staff, a number of British army
officers. Tho normal complement ot the
Hampshire is (!jn.
It wns ollifinllv made kno'wii in Lon
don thnt. Kitchener was to havo dis
cussed important miliary and financial
questions with tho uussian czar, ueing
coincident with tho beginning of tho
great Russian spring offensive against
tho Austro-Hungarian lines on the
southwestern front, his visit, it is bo-
bolicved, was to havo been ot extrcmo
importanco anil ot lar-reacning eueci
upon tho whole allied campaign.
Tho profoundest sensation of the en
tiro war has been created by the amaz
ing news of Kitchener s end. The news
spread like wildfire as tho clubs
and restaurants were filled with crowds
of lunchconcrs. As the news passed
along, all noise ceased instantly.
Loud conversations changed into whis-
pors. Ullicers suddenly icii men iu
tiles to rush intp tho streets in quest of.
further details.' In less than ten min
utes tho flags on ovory building, pub
lic and privato houses, wero lowered to
linlfmnst.
' Earl Kitchoncr was appointed sec
rotary of state for war in August, 1014,
n few days after Great Britain's de
claration of war on Germany. He was
regarded as England's greatest soldier,
nnd, notwithstanding the criticism
directed ngainst him, Kitchener s
greatest accomplishments during the
war were universally recognized. In
foremost of his achievements was tho
creation from England's untTained
manhood of a lingo nrmy. At the be
ginning of tho wnr Great Britnin had
only a few hundred thousand trained
men. Today more than 0,000,000 nro
enrolled in tho various branches of the
sorvico.
Without his crowning achievement
ns tho great organizer of tho British
campaign in tho European wnr, Kitch
ener has already won wldo nnd lasting
famo by his mnny campaigns in Egypt,
South Africa and in India.

MAMMOTH SEABATTLE.
English and German Fleets Wero En
gaged Off Danish Coast.
In the greatest sea "battle of all
time, both in lives and tonnago of ships
lost, tho English and German llects met
at the entrance of tho Skagcrrak, off
tho coast of Denmark, May 31. The
first news of the engagement reached
this country in a Berlin despatch last
Friday afternoon claiming a complete
defeat of the British fleet. Later ad
vices, however, havo tended to show
that the engagement was not so great
a German victory as first described.
As definitely as can be established
from the conflicting reports the British
losses were three battle cruisers, three
cruisers and eight destroyers while the
Germnns lost one or two battleships,
three cruisers and several torpedo boat
destroyers.
The loss of life on the British side
is bolieved to have been in excess of
5,000 including Rear Admiral Horace
Hood and over fiOO other officers. The
German' loss of life is estimated at' be
tween l,.r)00 mid 1000.
Berlin nsscrts that the fight hns
broken tho supremacy of tho British
ileet, while London tilliciai ropnris say
