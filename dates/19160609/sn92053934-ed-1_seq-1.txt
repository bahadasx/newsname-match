Gerard with the idea that, it was to

to sanction it. The statement follows:

Amsterdam, Holland, June 9. via

of
Gerard disclaims all responsibility for
what was represented as an interview
with him, published by the Berlin
Achtuhr Abenblatt and quoted in the
reichstag by Count von Westarp. The
fact is. according to the Vossische
Zeitung that Mr. Gerard received the
editor of the National Zeitung, to
whom he said that the visit to the
United States of Joseph C Grew, sec
retary of the American at Berlin, was
purely for private purposes. The am
bassador declined to reply to other
questions. Later the editor of the Na
tional Zeitung returned, the Vossische
Zeitung says, with a manuscript con
taining utterances atributed to the am
bassador. Mr. Gerard is said to have
torn up the paper in the presence of
John B. Jackson, a member of the em
bassy staff.
Veiled Thrust at Wilson.
The National Zeitung on Saturday
published what was represented to be
an interview with Mr. Gerard which
was referred to in a cable dispatch
from Berlin as bearing on its face indi
cations of unauthentlcity. The ambas
sador was quoted as saying he be
lieved peace was only a few months
off and as referring to President Wil
son's peace utterances in connection
with the presidential campaign. In
the reichstag on Monday Count von
Westarp declared bis uncompromising
opposition to President Wilson as a
peace mediator. Chancellor von Beth-mann-HolIweg
announced he had re
ceived no official intimation that the
president intended to offer mediation.
The state department a few days ago
cabled to Mr. Gerard an inquiry
whether he was responsible for two
alleged interviews on the subject of
peace which were credited to him in
Berlin dispatches.

Progressive convention recesses
at 1 :US p. m. until 3 :00 p. m. to
day. Auditorium, Chicago, June 9. A
pretty fight over the woman suffrage
plank in the progressive platform was
in prospect today. Some of the more
radical leaders of the suffrage move
ment were said not to be satisfied with
the plank as drawn by the resolutions
committee and were today bringing all
possible pressure to bear to change its
phraseology.
As adopted by the committee the
plank says that the progressive party
believes that, women "should be given
the full political right of suffrage
either by federal or state control."
This was looked upon as at best a com
promise and by some suffrage pro
ponents as a decided straddle. The
element which is dissatisfied with this
wording want a change so as to make
the plank read: "Women should be
given the full political right of suf
frage beth by federal and state action."

tion that legislation should be enacted

When the platform is taken up plank

ardent suffragist delegates leading it.
Another plank that is expected to
cause trouble is that on the question
of prohibition. In the resolutions com
mittee a motion to insert an out ana i
out declaration for a "dry" plank was
beaten, 30 to 13, but advocates of pro
hibition have not given up hope of a
reconstruction in the convention itself.

Before adjournment yesterday the
platform report was placed before the
convention by Dean William Draper
Lewis of the University of Pennsyl
vania, chairman of the resolutions
committee and it was made the unfin
ished business.
Those who were seeking delay to
give the peace conference committees
as much time as they desired in their
efforts to get together with the repub
licans, looked eagerly for a Roosevelt
demonstration. They were prepared
when it came to keep it going as long
as possible. They planned to bring
the platform and open it to unlimited
debate if necessary as soon as the del
egates showed any signs of demand
ing that the convention proceed with
nominations.

While the leaders talked, the dele
gates poured in. The Massachusetts
delegation marched in yelling. "We'd
better, nominate Roosevelt before its
too late."
"ThereTl Be a Hot Time in the Old
Town Tonight," sung by a male quar
tet, caught the delegates' fancy.
Governor Hiram Johnson of Cali
fornia, John M. Parker of Louisiana
and Raymond Robins of Illinois, the
convention chairman, were mentioned
prominently for vice-president.
Chairman Konins called ine conven
tion to order at 10:26.
The opening prayer by Rabbi Jos

ance for both conventions, was ap
plauded. Delegate Charles E. Mason of Maine
was recognized to offer seats on the
floor to the Georgia delegation, seated
at the rear of the stage, referring to
Georgia as "the home of Teddy's
mother."
The Georgia and Maine orators ex
changed compliments, all being loudly
cheered, especially at the declaration
by C. R. Hutchess of Georgia:
"We would rather fight and lose
than not to fight at all."
Delegates Delay Business.
Busines was halted while the Maine
and Iowa delegations mounted the
stage to exchange seats with the
Georgians, 'including several women,
who went to the main floor. The
crowd cheered loudly, the band played
"Dixie" and the Georgians sang a
verse. Chairman Robins announced
that the report on the peace confer
ence was not quite ready and brought
up the convention's unfinished busi
ness and the platform, to be read
plank by plank by Dean William
Draper Lewis, chairman of the resolu

that the woman suffrage plank be
taken up in order. He moved the ap

Republican Convention Gossip
BT J. M. COLLIGAN.
(bpeciai to ine Argus).
Chicago, June ine gold room
of the Congress hotel, which is
headquarters of Senator Sherman
Illinois' candidate for the repub
lican presidential nomination, at
times has the appearance of a
Fourteenth congressional district con
vention of the grand old party. Every
city and hamlet in the district has a
large representation of the faithful.
Between parades and rallies for Sher
man, and these are frequent and en
thusiastic, far more so than are the
demonstrations organized in behalf of
other favorite sons, the Fourteenth dis
trict chieftains turn to a discussion of
the party congressional situation. The
one question uppermost in their minds
is to trot out the man who will make
the hardest fight against Congressman
Tavenner, whose popularity among the
the voters of the district, irrespective
of party affiliations, is generally con
ceded. "That chan Tavenner has
J made good with the masses of the peo
ple, there is no discounting that fact,"
said one republican. "I wouldn't vote
for him, but 1 find that many of my
neighbors will do so, largely because
they have been impressed by his ac
tivity; they say he is always trying
to do something. The point I make is
that if we republicans expect to make
any kind of a showing aeainst that
! young fellow we must put the veter
ans on the side track and spring a
youngster filled with vigor and ambi
tion to be of serrice to his district and
to his nation."
Both James McKinney, former rep
resentative from the Fourteenth dis
trict, and William G. Graham are on
the ground. Both hail from Mercer
county. Graham is an avowed aspir
ant for the congressional nomination.
McKinney is in a receptive mood.
He has not gone farther than feeling
out sentiment in his party over the
district. Graham has canvassed the
district, and declares that he has been
assured the support of Rock Island,
Mercer and McDonough counties.

What sounded all the world like an
honest tribute to President Wilson was
uttered, though doubtless in a moment
of unguardedness, by l.hauncey Depew
in the course of an address he deliver
ed at the Coliseum Thursday morning
while the convention was waiting on
the resolutions committee. The patri
archal statesman and punster was ac
corded an ovation as he was led to
the platform. In fact his presence
had the effect of arousing the dele
gates from a lethargy that refused to
be stirred by patriotic; selections by
the bands or other stimulators offered
on such occasions to make the thou
sands on the outside believe they are
missing something. The Depew voice'
at the outset, was inaudibly low, but
as he swung his right arm several
times a sort of imitation of Christy
Matliewson he began to show his old
form and gave a sample of the pep
that he maintains is still in him de
spite his S3 years. There were those
who remarked that Chauncey was try
ing to imitate Billy Sunday in his style
of delivery. However, it was during
the serious moments at the beginning
of his speech that the New Yorker ac
cidentally complimented President
Wilson. "My friends," he said, "we
ought to be thankful for having been
so successfully voyaged through an in
ternational crisis that is involving al
most the entire world in bloodshed
and carnage." Then he caught him
self. Many of the delegates and those
in the galleries got the drift of the
Depew sentiment, although it would
never do for him to confess that he
had the president in mind when he
gave expression to the gratitude that
the nation entertained for having been
kept at peace with the world, save the
little skirmish along the Mexican bor
der. The New Yorker, for the mo
ment, apparently was dreaming of the
beauty and satisfaction of national
contentment. But when he pulled
himself together he shifted to shafts
of criticism at the democratic admin
istration, but really he didn't say any-1
thing wicked. He went no further
than to refer to the president as a
professor. He played numerous tunes
at the expense of the stars and stripes
and said war preparedness was
thoroughly American and he believed
in it, and he knew that the people
were going to demand it up to the
point of unquestioned adequateness.
Most of the former senator's remarks
were occupied with legislative inci
dents that transpired so many years
ago that there were few in the vast
audience other than himself who knew
what he was talking about. Truth is,
while Chauncey is still a charming and
polished gentleman and gifted orator,
he has become our greatest "I remem
ber when."

room ready for him when he arrived,
he havine made arraneements several

of the hotel. Copp declined to make
known the price he was paying for
his room, but others who are in Chi
cago at this time stopping at different
loop hotels have discovered that the
minimum rate for a room is $4.50, for
one. two or three persons. At that all
of the hotels are crowded. There is a
positive Jam at the Congress, which is
the center around which all of the in
cidental convention activities pivot. At
11 o'clock Copp retired at least he
claims he did. Mr. Dineen not the
former governor a Moline friend,
who was contemplating picking out a
spot in Grant park on which to pass
the remainder of the night, was res
cued by Copp, who shared his room
with him. At 4 o'clock a. m. Copp
said he was awakened by a pounding
on his door. He at first suspected it
was a fire warning. Presently he
awakened sufficiently to get on his feet
and go to the door. As he opened it in

the New Harper in Rock Island. Be

Rock Island boniface what he thought
about a man coming to another man's
room at such an unseemly hour Carl
had the story of his struggle for a bed
under way. It was a tale that would
have moved a wooden man to tears.
Carl had failed to make an advance
reservation. When he reached the
Congress he appreciated the futility
of trying for accommodations. Then
he thought of his old life saver. Copp,
who had been a friend in need in other

elevator. Mr. Copp, it should be re
membered, is a good business man.
"These fellows who have a habit of
breaking in on me at all hours of the
night may think that they are sleep

mistaken, as some of them have
learned. When possible I make prompt
collections. When they get away from
me I mail a statement, and in every
instance up to now they have come
through without a whimper. You see,
in that way I may get through con

customer he has not yet been able to
secure a fee from. She is Mary
Roberts' Rinehart, the magazine writ

vention. Mrs. Rinehart is having her
mail delivered at Copp's room. Twice

room to get her mail for her. "For a
woman who is making $100,000 a year

chances in permitting her letters to

BORAH AS A PEACEMAKER
IS AGAIN REGARDED AS
PRESIDENTIAL POSSIBILITY
Auditorium Hall, June 9. After fin
ishing consideration of their platform,
section by section but without voting
for its final adoption, the progressive
convention recessed for lunch at 1:08
until 3 p. m.
The conference committees are un
derstood to be watching the situation
to determine whether there is any use
to try again to get together. This de
pended, it was said, on whether the
republicans went on with nominations
or desired further parleys.
A visit and speech by Senator Borah
was said by Mr. Perkins to be "another
sign of the friendly spirit between the
two conventions."
Mr. Perkins said he could not know
what significance could be attached to
the senator's visit. Some leaders sug
gested that Borah might be the com
promise nominee suggested by the re
publicans. "Anyway we're making a record for
ourselves that will set us right before
the country. No matter what the out
come, we've got 'em anyway," Perkins
said.
Without any preliminary announce
ment Senator William E. Borah en
tered the Auditorium hall this after
noon where the progressives were as
sembled in convention. He was escort
ed to the platform. A tremendous
ovation was given him.
Chairman Robins introduced Sen
ator Borah and the convention roared
itself hoarse when the senator said he
had not come officially.
"It is well known the deep-seated
affection I have for your leader," he
said, and was halted by another salvo
of enthusiasm, the whole convention in
a mighty chant, shouting:
"We want Teddy," for a full minute,
while Borah smilingly waited. The
shouting lulled and then was renewed,
leaders on the stage joining.
"There's no doubt you want Teddy,"
said Senator Borah.
"We want Borah, too," answered the
delegates and the senator proceeded.
He put a quietus on the whispered
circulation of his name as a possible
"Moses" by reminding the progressive
convention that he was present as a
member of a committee from "anoth
er convention."
"There isn't a doubt but that you
want Teddy and that millions of cit
izens throughout the country also
want Teddy." he began.
"You are fortunate in having a lead-

Mrs. Rinehart would do would be to
notify her husband every woman

ALMOST A SCAXDAL.
A prominent Rock Island citizen
came dangerously close to getting hi3
name in the papers as a result of an
encounter in Peacock Alley last night
in which everything was done except
exchanging physical blows. It con
tinues a topic of discussion about the
lobbies of the hotels. The other party
to the quarrel is a Chicagoan. It was
purely a political argument. There
wasn't a woman in the case, although
there had been considerable frivoling
with bubble goods by the party of
which the belligerent pair were mem
bers. Only intercession of mutual
friends prevented the men mixing in
the center of the alley, which was
filled with convention revelers. The
parting shot of the Rock Islander,
who has been a friend of the Chicagoan
for yars, was this: "If we both live
a hundred years I don't want you ever
to speak to me of recognize me, no
matter what the circumstances ander
which we may be thrown togetner in
the future. It took me some years to
get your measure, out 1 now nave It."
The Chicagoan plead, friends made
overtures, but the Rock Islander, who
was perfectly sober, stood pat And
he is a man who usually means what
he says.
SHERMAX GAINS GR0OD.
Among the favorite sons for presi
dent, judging by hotel enthusiasm.
Sherman of Illinois has the pole, with
Burton second and Fairbanks third.
Sherman's supporters staged a big
demonstration Wednesday night, pa
rading the hotel lobbies and visiting
the quarters of the various other can
didates. From 8 till 10 a rousing
meeting was held in the gold room,
where two bands, one of which was
the First Regiment, interspersed a pro
gram of speeches with music. The
generalship of Manager Walter Ros
enfield is everywhere manifest in the
campaign for Sherman. Here are some
of the signs seen in the gold room:
"Illinois gave us Lincoln and Grant;
now Sherman"; "Picture of Larry
Sherman sawing wood to earn money
to buy school books"; "Sherman was a
teamster 30 years ago." Macomb,
Sherman's old home town, has a large
delegation of boosters on the ground.
headed by a band. Captain Rosenfield
is as optimistic as ever over the
prospects of his candidate. "As
suredly it can't be said that Sher
man has lost any ground as a
result of the Hughes boom," said
his campaign jpianager. "The con
trary is true as to some of the other
favorite sons. Sherman in the past
few days has increased his supporters
outside of Illinois. As the situation
stands today nobody can say for a
certainty who will be the republican
nominee. If a choice is not made be

than any other man to make the issues
of this campaign.
"But let us bear in mind what these
two conventions do here will perhaps
decide the welfare of the United States
for the next quarter of a century. We
can only insure ourselves by working
together in close cooperation. I do
not discourage your loyalty and en
thusiasm to your leader, but I must
say it is essential that before we leave
this great city it should be definitely
determined that we will march and
tight together in this great conflict.
"But if the two conventions agree
upon your great leader you will find no
more enthusiastic supporter than my
self." Borah concluded, amid applause and
shouts of Roosevelt and Borah.
As Borah shook hands with the
leaders on the stage and left, the floor
hummed with excited discussion of his
dramatic visit.

purpose of continuing at
work until a presidential
nomination was made.
Chicago, Jnne 9. 5omiaationt
of candidates began today ) the
republican national convention.
The first was that of Justice
Hughes. Governor Whitman made
the nominating speech. Then as
the roll of states was called, Ala
bama and Alaska passed and Ari
zona yielded to Jiew York.
Governor Whitman's speech was in
terrupted by a six minute demonstra
tion for former President Taft, which
the republican peace conferees de
clared they considered "unofficial in
struction." Elihu Root was nominated
by Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler and
Governor Willis of Ohio nominated
former Senator Theodore Burton of
Ohio.
Situation Unsettled,
The republican and progressive na
tional conventions assembled today
with the situation in both camps so
unsettled that no one would venture a
prediction as to the probable doings of
the day.
A midnight conference of "peace"
committees from the progressive and
republican conventions took place at
the Chicago club, an institution which,
at various times has housed many of
the distinguished men of the nation.
The conference adjourned before I
o'clock without definite result, it was
said, and details of its deliberations
were withheld. It may meet again
this afternoon or tonight.
Members of "Peace" Committee.
The republicans were Reed Smoot of
Utah, former Senator W. Murray Crane
of Massachusetts, Senator William E.
Borah of Idaho, Nicholas Murray But
ler of New York and A. R. Johnson of
Ohio.
The progressive committee had
George W. Perkins of New York for
chairman and the other members were
Governor Hiram Johnson of California.
Horace B. Wilkinson of New York.
Charles J. Bonaparte of Maryland and
John M. Parker of New Orleans.
Every member of the republican
"peace" committee took part in the
management of the republican conven
tion of 1912, which brought the pro
gressive party into being. Crane,
Smoot and Butler were determined ad
vocates of methods to prevent the nom
ination of Colonel Roosevelt then. A.
R. Johnson, then In congress, support
ed them. Borah was for Roosevelt,
hut refused to leave the republican
party. When Vice President Sherman
died Mr. Butler was selected as the
running mate of President Taft. Cjv
ernor Johnson was candidate for vice
president with Roosevelt on the 1912
progressive ticket. Hundreds of time
Governor Johnson has denounced with
great vigor the action in 1912 of the
men who last night sat across from
him at the council table.
Report Profrretu.
For more than two hours the con
ferees discussed the points at issue
between the progressives and repub
licans and took up details of the peace
pians projected earlier in the day by
the two conventions when the con
ference committees on harmony had
oeen appointed, when adjournment
came it was announced that "we re
port progress" and the statement waa
made that the members of the two
committees would not get together
again until after the sessions of the
conventions today. They prepared re
ports, which are being presented to
their respective conventions. There is
considerable doubt as to just how these
reports will be received by the dele
gates and whether leaders In the two
conventions can hold the body of dele
gates under control while further har
mony deliberations are being held.

A party of women were the first vis
itors to arrive at the Coliseum when
