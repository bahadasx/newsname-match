On Tuesday morning the alumni
association was addressed by J. B.
Hunter. J0sq.. on the subject, "New
berry College?Her Needs." Mr.
Hunter's address was timely and
practical as it dealt with the problems
confronting the college and why
anc how they should be solved. Mr.
Hun'.tr is a good lawyer and a man of
large business capacity as well as of '
sound judgment.
immediately after Mr. Hunter's address
the association went into a
business session concerning the needs
and affairs of the college. Mr. Rufus
Monts of Cochran, Ga., -was
chosen as the next alumni orator. All
vof the officers were reelected, as follows:
B. V. Chapman, president;

The address to the literary societies,
of which there are three, was
t to have been made, as usual, on Tues
day night but the electrical storm ana
the rain about half an hour before the
exercises were scheduled to start, interfered
and the address was post|
poned to Wednesday. In spite of the
inclement weather a small crowd
? had gathered and waited patiently until
9 o'clcok when Dr. Harms appear1
ed on the stage and announced that

and the absence of the speaker who I
had been deterred frcm reaching the
city from the home of Mr. Tiios. AY.
Keitt where he was stopping, the exercises
were called off. He said, how
ever, that Judge Woods, the speaker,
would be placed on Wednesday s
program.
On Wednesday morning at 10:30
oclock the class day exercises were
opened with prayer by Rev. E. W.
Leslie of Prosperity. There were six
speakers chosen from the class who

music. They were:
Salutatory?G. Dewey Oxner
"Loyalty"?Kenneth R. Kreps.
"Newberry's 'Needs"?Lance Swindler.
"The Virility of the Pulpit*'?
Charles E. tuaennour.
"The Plague of Politics"?Carroll
D. Hipp.
' Valedictory?James C. Kinard.
At the close of the graduating
speeches Dr. Cromer came forward
and in a few happy remarks introduced
Hon. Charles A. Woods, distrivt
fedei/.l judge who was to have made
tv?o adrfrwc thp niffht before to the
literary societies.
Judge Woods took "Fiction" as his '
subject and discussed it, not fro-m the ;
standpoint of literary production, as
one- might surmise, but from the view- J
point of laws and customs that time
and experience have shown to be unsound
and fallacious. The speaker
compared the legal status of a married
woman in her property rights of
fifty years ago when her husband became
the owner of all her property at
marriage and became responsible for
?n A rvKf ^ rt/->n tr-j nt orl hpfnrp mar- i
ail 11C1 UCUIO vuuvi UVLVU KV.W,
riage?compared these rights with the j
privilege of a married woman of today,
to hold property in her own!
right.
Another fiction that might pass
away is the right to hid unimproevd
property and he took real estate as
an example to show that there is
ln**r*A Af nwnorc <-kf farm lands !
residing in our towns and cities who i
make nc attempt to improve their)
lands but wait for their value to rise [
by reason of the improevment of sur- j
rounding lands. His premise was
that the ownership of prperty is more
of a trust than a right. Judge Woods
closed with some strong waords or"
advice to the graduating class.
Upon the conclusion of Judge
vVbods address Dr. Harms Announced
that James, C. Kinard had won the
first honor of his class and that G.
Dewey Oxner had won second honor.
The presenting of diplomas and o!
medals then took place, the following

"Learn to live, and live to learn,
Ignorance like a fire doth burn,
Little tasks make large return."
I would commend this sentiment,
expressed by Bayard Taylor in his
ode to his daughter, to every son and
daughter, who should aspire to the
larger opportunities afforded every
student nowadays in our primary and
secondary institutions of learning.
That many are taking advantage of
these opportunities is very apparent
to the thoughtful observer at the sev

drawing to a close.
The Whitmire graded scnool commencement
exercises, held iMonday
evening, June 5, proved a striking
confirmation of this thought, the published
program indicating strenuous
labor on the part of teachers, and
careful preparation, by the pupils. In
fact, as I entered the large auditorium
of the commodious school
building, my mind at once was impressed
with the idea of success as
the dominant tone and regnant qual
lty oi tne entire commuun^, v> iuucwcu
particularly on this occasion by large
attendance, patient hearing, and
hearty interest. The audience was i
eager to take in -every part presented,
and evinced generous applause to the
young contestants in debates, recitations
and declamations. And the musical
numbers, were as heartily appreciated.
It should go without saying that
any well conducted school such as
the Whitmire will be sure of success,
if supported as genuinly as this school
is by the citizens of Whitmire and'
surrounding country. The trustees,
Messrs. Z. H. Suber, T. W. Coleman,
A. P. Hurt, are well known to be
progressive in thought and liberal in
their support, in means and time devoted,
without which success could
not well be spelled in large letter-3.
It is a good thing for any school
when trustees conceive the best purposes
and lend themseL.es wifch ail
heartiness to insure the ultimate
good, as we are persuaded is done by
these gentlemen. I am told there is
utmost harmony prevalent and no
bickering among the patrons, a fortunate
absence of that bane which too
often crov i out and destroy the life
of a school, despite heroic effort to
overcome it.
The superintendent, Prof. C. 13.
rfanna, is ably supported by a loyal,
corps of teachers all of whom have
been reelected for the ensuing year.
In the declamation contest, the
honor was won :by Ernest Hurt,
wlio was given a medal.
In the debate "Resolved, That women
should have the right of sufrage,"
the judges awarded the medal
to Miss Lois Tidmarsh.
Col. E. H. Aull, to encourage excellence
in English composition and to
foster a love for our own Southland,
offered a medal for the best composition
on "Reconstruction,"' which was
won by Theodore Hay. it was a, gwu
paper and will be published later in
The herald and News. In the high
school department, there were two
graduates, Samuel Gary and Theadore
Hay, while several were promoted
to that department for the
coming scholastic term.
County superintendent of education,
Chas. P. Barre, presented the diplomas
to the graduating class, prefacing
with some ^pleasing remarks on
the value of a liberal education.

admonitions, which it were well
for the young to ponder over and appropriate.

to me. And now, in closing may
I add my mite of suggestion to each
participant.

IU'GHES OVERSHADOWING
FIELD OF REPUBLICANS
? \
Chicago, June 7.?More political
leaders are predicting the nomination
of Justice Charles Evans Hughes tonisrht
fhnn at anv timp sinrp fhp Tie
publican national convention began
to assemble. They declare that unless
the accumulation of overwhelming
circumstantial evidence fails to
reflect the situation in its true light,
the nomination of the justice will
come even sooner than has been predicted.
The men who take this <vlew
are practical politicians whose estimates
are based on careful canvass
of the delegates.
The situation is illustrated best by
the fact that conferences betweenleaders
to discuss the availability of
different candidates practically have
ceased, indicating their belief that a
majorty of the delegates already
have reached a decision to name Justice
Hughes.
Convention observers find it impossible
not td be impressed by the confident
predictions of these leaders j^he \
say that the Hughes boom now jha*
grown to Such formidable proportions
that Colonel Roosevelt no longer 4
holds the veto power which until this
afternoon had been conceded to him*
as part of the program to bring th?
Republican and Progressive * parties
into accord.
Harmony Efforts Fail.
Four days of constant and persist-1
ent effort to bring the two parties
- ?v : ~ np
lugeuier, iu wuiuu lue yeiauucmLjr uv
the nominee was subordinated to harmony,
failed to bring the results desired
and the trend from the outset
was definitely toward the nomination
of Justice Hughes.
Had Colonel Roosevelt announced
during this period that he would not
support the justice the leaders were
prepared to turn to any one of the
regular Republican candidates. The
colonel remained silent, however, and
because' the managers of other candidacies
had fostered the Hughetf^boom
for the purpose of eliminating Roosevelt
as a possibility, it grew
prodigiously, ?and even a combination
of the favorite sons strength was
powerless to check it.
The reason for this was that the ?
candidacy of no other Republican
made any progress and delegates
pledged to favorite sons found no other
presidential possibility but Justice
Hughes to whom they could turn their
strength. Justice Hughes thus naturally
became the choice of ipractically
all delegates instructed for others.
They became eager to go to him as
soon as they could secure release
from their pledges.
-aa -.T X
3UIP totes rirsi rwuiuu
T3f lughes managers tonight reiterate*.
their claim that he -will have
about 300 votes on the first ballot.
Frank H. Hitchcock, spokesman for
the Hughes followers, said there
would be no attempt to. nominate the
justice on the first ballot and that it
was their desire to have all the facnn
Hojocrafpq deliver their
IUIIOIC CVU uv*vg??v>
complimentary votes. He believed,
however, that the second ballot with
the release of many delegates from
their obligations, would swell the
Hughes vote to such proportions that
his nomination would almost certainly
be made on the third ballot. Many
of the Hughes supporters were even
more optimistic and said they thought
that before the result of the second
ballot 'was announced the drift would
be apparent to all delegates and there
would be enough changes of votes to
bring a nomination on the second ballot.
The Hughes managers expect Arizona
second on the roll of States to
yield to New York so Governor Whitman
may place Justice Hughes in
