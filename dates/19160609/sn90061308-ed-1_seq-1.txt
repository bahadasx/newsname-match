ARKANSAS' DEATH
TOLI, FIXED AT 79
Chicago, June 8.-r-More political
leaders are predicting the nomination
of Justice Charles Evans Hughes to
day than at any time since the Repub
lican national convention began to as
semble. ; They declare that unless the
accumulation of overwhelming circum
stantial evidence fails to reflect the
situatioifin the true light, the nomina
tion of the justice will come -even
sooner tnan has been predicted. The
men who take this view are politicians
who do not make estimates unless
they are based on careful canvass of
the delegates. v
The situation is illustrated best by
the fact that conferences between the
leaders to discuss the availability oi
different candidates practically have
ceased, indicating their belief that a
majority of the delegates already have
reached a decision to name Justice
Hughes.
Convention observers find it impos
sible not to be impressed by the con
fident prediction of these leaders, who
say that the Hughes boom now has
grown to such formidable proportions
that Colonel Roosevelt no longer holds
the veto power which, until yesterday
afternoon, had been conceded 'to him
as part of the program to bring the
Republican and progressive paruea
. into accord.
' Four days of constant and persistent
eifort to bring the two parties togeth
er, in which the personality of the
nominee was subordinated to harmony,
failed to bring the results desired, and
the trend from the outset was definite
. ly toward the nomination of Justice
Hughes. i .-,

Marionyille, Mo., June 7. The
ba.d'dernposed remains of a baby
were found by Mrs. Sarah Heaton, a
washwoman, in a cistern at her home
here. The cistern was used only at
times of washing and the body had
probably been there for several days
before being' discovered floating on
top of the water.
No satisfactory explanation of the
tragedy was revealed Sit the coroner's
inquest. Evidence that the infant
had been murdered was found from
the fact that the skull bore marks of
violence. ' ;-

"Thirty-nine automobiles loaded with
an average of five persons to each car
made the trip from Barry county to
Monte Ne, June 4. Twenty-five of
the cars were from Cassville, the oth
er cars were from Washburn, Selig
man and Wheaton. A large number
of cars were expected from Monett but
for some reason they did not make tne
trip.
The visitors arrived at Monte JNe
at about 10:30 o'clock. A fine dinner
was served in the large dining room
of the Harvey hotel to some 200 per
sons. After dinner Mr. Harvey, who
is one of the leading workers for the
establishment of the Ozark Trail
roads, had all tables cleared in the big
dininfif room and entertained the vis
itors with a very interesting talk on
the Ozark Trail roads. He is familiar
with every detail and all the plans
proposed for establishing this great
highway from St. Louis to the West.
Following his instructive talk, a num

Sixty of the dead were white per

Communication was re-established

cut off from the outside world since
the storm stories of widespread de
vastation came to light. While no

from any official source, it is believed
the damage will amount to more than
$1,000,000. Appeals for aid were re
ceived here from Heber Springs,
where 22 persons were killed, and
frnm Cabot. The Little Rock board
of commerce sent two trained nurses

Fort. Vaux. lvine skme five miles
northeast of Verdun, which for weeks
past the French had been stubbornly
defending against terrific onslaughts
by the Germans, has at last fallen
into the hands of the Teutons, accord
ing to Berlin. The men who defended
the fortress to the last surrendered to
the Germans, who also captured a
large number of machine guns and
mine throwers. .
Paris, however, says the fort was
still in French hands early Wednesday
morning, but that since then it had
been impossible to communicate with
the fort, owing to the violence of the
bombardment.
Gains of considerable proportions
hv the Russians over the Teutonic al
lies- hv thp Turks over the Kussians,
and by the Germans over the British,
are recorded in the latest omciai
communications ' to Petrograd, Con
stantinople and London. In the re
gion of Verdun violent artillery com
bats are in progress, while on the
Austro-Italian line the Italians con
tinue to hold the Austrians from
further advaccei.
. In the fighting that is going on
from the Pripet marshes to the Ru
manian frontier, the Russians in their
Kio- nffpnsive movement have dislodged
the Teutonic allies from fortified posi
tions and brought up their aggregate
of men captured up about 41,000.
They have also taken 77 guns, 134 -machine
guns and 49 bomb throwers.
Among the men made prisoners are
00 officers.
As an offset to the Russian gains
over the . Teutonic allies, however,
Constantinople asserts that in Asia
Minor, in the Kope mountain district,
the Russians have been driven eight
! ninmobrs eastward from positions
j extending over 14 kilometers, suffering
losses of more than 1000 men killed
or wounded. me ngni,mK l
