The bombarded shell of ol Kurt
Vaux has finally passed let) posses
sion of the Oorinnns nfter a heroic
resistance, in which the troops were
cut off from food supplies for five
days und from all communication for
24 hours. The French, on withdraw
ing, however, still held the trenches
sweeping around the western und
southern slopes of the fortres.
The desperate defense made by
Commander Kay mil and the small
contingent left In the fort constitutes
one of the most notahle incidents 01
the Verdun campaign. The fort haw
been gradualy pounded to pieces in a
terrific seven-day bombardment,
while infantry rushes were repeatedly
launched against the slopes nf the
fort, its ditches and outworks. Karly
yesterday morning Oeneral Itaynnl's
force was cut off for the first tlim
from communicating with the French
trenches three hutidrtd yards to the
south. The means of transporting
provisions and shells had previously
been destroyed and the stock jf food
in the gurrioii was exhausted.
Vse 1':-cnIi Troops,
Tn the meantime the (iermaru.
brought up two fresh divisions und
hurled them forward in five succes

of the fearful losses caused by tin.

of the fort nnd sweeping over Its t x

received from dcncral Itaynal since
communication was first cut und
nothing is known of his fate or that
of his men.
The French lines now embrace the
