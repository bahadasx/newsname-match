SUFFRAGE
CAUSIN
In the National Convention of
the Progressive Party
in Chicago.
CHIt'A'iO, June 9. A pretty light

Progress!w pla'form wan In product
today. Home ??f tin t: nrc radical
leaders of the mi (Tragi mo\ement

plank as drawn by tin roHOluilons
,.r.. ijiittp (, .,? wo; o laj hrlnglrt
. !1 possible pressure to hear to
change its phraseology.
As adopted by tin* committee the
plank Rays that the Progressive party
believes that women "should he given
the full political rights of suffrage,
either hj federal or state action."
This was looked upon as at best n
compromise and by some suffrage
proponents as a d??cided At raddle. The
element w hich Is dissatisfied with
this wording want a change no as to
make the plank read "women should
be given tho full political right of
< alTrng. . both bv federal ami state
action," which they hold Is a positive
declaration that legislation
should h?* enacted by Congress and
b> The states as well. When the
platform is takon up plnnk by plank
ti fight probably will result in general
debate with ho me of tb?- ardent 1
sufTrac' delegates leading it.
