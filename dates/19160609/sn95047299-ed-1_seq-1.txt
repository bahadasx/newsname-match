for the Palatka-East Palatka-Federal
t'oint ban Mateo-Pemel and Rice
Creek roads (known as the Palatka
Special Tax Road District) to the
Georgia Engineering Co. The same
company also got the contract for the
concrete work. It is stated that the
cost of road on this contract will be
$7,900 per mile, and the contracting
company gives assurance that it is the
lowest price per mile ever made in
Florida.
The board went on record as favor
ing the construction of dipping vat3
throughout the county for getting rid
of the cattle tick.
The. board instructed the county
bridge tenders to pass Miss Josephine

Judge Haskell Improving.
Dr. A. M. Steen returned from
Boston on Wednesday r.fternoon,
whither he had been with County
Judge E. E. Haskell, who on Satur
day underwent a serious operation
at the Goijeral Hospital in t.:.t city.
Dr. Steen states that a telegram
from Judge Haskell says In is mak
ing good improvement, and th:t h.
is asrared that he can probably be re
leased fiv-m the hospital in two weeks.
Woman's Club Ends Season.
The closing meeting of the Wo
man's Club for the season was held
last Friday afternoon in the Putnam
House parlors. There was a good
attendance present to hear the year's
reports from the officers and chair
men of the various committees.
The retiring president, Mrs. I). J.
Coughlin, read her final message of
the club season's activities and gave
a full account that covered the ground
very thoroughly. The work along all
Club lines lias been very dear to her
heart and she has given ivit.vingly
of her full interest in time, ability,
and finance. The motto fitly applies
to this servant of the Club, "she
hath done what she could." The
Club was invited by Mrs. Coughlin
at the close of the meeting to go to
Smith's as her guests, and ices with
cake were served. Mrs. Coughlin
led the incoming president, Mrs. J.
L. Dunsford to the chair alter her re
port and introduced her to the Club
members as their new head. I'lans
are under way for the building of the
new Club house tins summer and it
is hoped that by the opening of next
Club season, they will have at least
a place, that while it may not be
complete, may be the Llubs very
own building and that will be a sat
is faction. Mrs." Coughlin will be
missed, but she will still continue her
activities, while retiring as the ac
tive hrad. The incoming president,
Mrs. Dunsford, has worked faith
fully for the club's interests and is
also a woman of fine character, ability
and presence and we bid her welcome.
PERFORATES NEGRO
Burglar and Kills Him in
His Tracks Had Robbed
Kanner Store.
George Porter, alias Gable, a noto
rious character, who has made thiev
ing a specialty, broke into Kanner's
store, corner of Lemon and Fourth
street at an early hour Tuesday
morning. He gained entrance by
throwing a brick through the plate
glass window. He was seen making
away with the lo"ot and Chief Livings
ton was notified. Mr. Livingston was
soon on the ground and seeing the ne
gro, gave chase. When about a half
block from the fleeing thief Chief
Livingston called on him to stop. As
he paid no attention to this order, Mr.
Livingston opened fire on him and the
negro dropped in his tracks. He died
almost instantly. The ball had
pierced his body.
All the stolen property was recov
ered, as the dead thief had it with
him.
His body was turned over to the
undertaker and buried. An inquest
the following day completely exoner
ated Mr. Livingston. Rather the jury
seemed inclined, like other sensible
men, to congratulate the Chief of po
lice on his thorough job in ridding
the city of a well-known thief who had
spent the better part of his days in
the penitentiary. Mr. Livingston
fired at the man's legs, but as both
were running it was impossible to
give an exemplification of accurate
markmanship.

they must of went back on him when
they happened to see mm a laium iu
John Mallen one day last week down
bv the post office. "They are an aw

for no triflin' with Romanism m any
of its forms. But I was only talking
with John about that rich land ot
Charlee George over by elvmgton,
which raises the best chickens m all

He sort 'o thought that Bill would le.

would soon be ready to forgive him for
having the effrontery to rim against a
reformed republican whose mission
seems to be to purify the democracy
of its has-beens and elevate the party
of Jefferson and Tom Taggert and
Charley Murphy to a spirituality nev

So he's back at the desk trying to
earn an honest living for his neglected
family.

More Appropriate.
Sir George Alexander's original name
was Samson before lie went on the
stage, and apropos of this fact a good
story is told. A well known theatrical
manager was once discussing Sir
George with a friend.
"Ity the way, Alexander isu"t his
right name, Is it?'' Inquired the friend.
"No," said the manager. "It used to
be Samson. It was a pity to change
tho name of Samson to Alexander."
"Oil, but Alexander conquered the
world, you know!" laughed the other.
"Yes," answered the manager, "but
Samson Is a more appropriate theatri
cal man. Have you forgotten that
Samson was the first man who brought
down the house?'' London Mall.
The Penny of England.
Most nncleiit of Lnglish coins, the
penny has exierienced many changes
In its long history. Until the time of
Edward I., when halfpennies and far
things were first coined, the penny was
deeply indented with a cross, so that it
could easily be brokeu Into four parts.
It was originally of silver and was
gradually reduced In weight, was de
based at sundry times and in 1707 was
coined In copper. The copper penny
continued clown to LSdO, when tho
bronze penny, as it exists today, was
first introduced.
Putnam county polled a record vote
last Tuesday in the State and County
Democratic primaries. The total vote
polled in the county was nearly 1,400.
What was the fact in Putnam was
also the fact in the other counties of
the State. A tremendous vote was
polled.
Park Trammell appears to be elect
ed to the U. S. Senate on first choice
votes. He is way in advance of Bry
an, the next highest of his opponents.
With his second choice votes added,
his race has been simply a walkaway.
For Governor it is nip and tuck be
tween Knott and Catts for first place,
with Karris spurting away behind as
third in the race.' Should Catts fi
nally be shown to bo some ahead in
first choice votes, it is thought Knott
will win with the second choice bal
lots to be added. Catts, it is consid
ered, will get very few second choice
votes. The men who vote for Knott,
Farris, Hudson and Wood, are anti
Catts on general principles, and would
select from the other candidates for
their second choice.
It is said that Judge Cockrell for
Justice of the Supreme Court, has
been defeated by Jefferson B. Browne
of Key West.
W. N. Sheats has undoubtedly been
re-elected State Superintendent of
Public Instruction over Dr. J. L. Kel
ley of Gainesville.-
H. Clay Crawford will continue as
Secretary of State, he undoubtedly
having a big majority over Adrian P.
Jordan of Punta Gorda.
J. C. Luning is re-elected State
Treasurer by a close margin over
Cririer.
Congressman Joe Sears of this dis
trict will continue in his job, having
la slight margin over i'ogarty and
Forrest Lake.
In the Third Congressional District,
! J. H. Smithwiek of Pensacola is
probably nominated.
Frank Clark will continue to rep
resent the Second District. He had
no opposition.
The surprise comes from the First
Congressional District, where Hon.
II. J. Drane of Lakeland was elected
over Hon. S. M. Sparkman of Tam
pa, who has represented that district
for 22 years. Sparkman is chair
man of the Committee on Rivers and
Harbors.
Hon. A. S. Wells is in the lead thus
far for State Railroad Commissioner,
with Dunn a close second.
The race for Comptroller appears
to De oeiween Aine J. Angle and rJr
nest Amos, with the chances favoring
the latter.
The Putnam County Contests.
As stated above there were some
surprises in the county contents. Per
haps the most sweeping victory of the
day was that of Julian C. Calhoun
for County Judge over J. N. Black
well. Calhoun won by a majority of
283, the largest majority given to
any of the candidates.
Randall Wells for tax collector was
the only candidate, where three or
more were running for the same of
fice, to secure a majority on first
choice votes. Wells had a majority
ot over both Curry and Howell.
Mr. Tilghman's majority for repre
sentative was 210, and P. M. Hagan
had a lead over John D. Pigue, next
highest in the race for sheriff, of 191.
Price had a majority of 144 over
Cottingham for Superintendent of
Schools, and Bullard led Conway for
tax assessor . by 199 votes. R. J.
Hancock had a majority of 77 votes
over Henry Hutchinson for clerk.
Perhaps the closest race was that
for county commissioner in the First
district, where Johnson Tucker of
Georgetown had a majority of 1 vote
over the veteran W. C. Alvers. Mr.
Tucker has been in bed seriously ill
with pleurisy ffor Something (more
than two weeks, and it is doubtful if
he was sufficiently recovered to get
out and vote for himself, which he
would have been justified in doing.
Putnam county stood by Gov. Tram
mell in good shape by giving him a
majority of 311 votes over the com
bined votes of Bryan, Gilchrist and
Wall.
It also stood firmly by Congress
man Joe Sears, giving him a majori
ty of 255 over both Lake and Fo
gerty. H. Clay Crawford also re
ceived such a majority as will make
him think kindly of Putnam coun
ty in after years it was only 402
over Jordan.
The tabulated returns given in an
other part of this paper are only the
unofficial first choice votes as tabu
lated at the Fearnside Clothing Go's
store. There may be some slight
changes, but not enough to effect the
result. The board of canvassers wera
engaged all yesterday in canvassing
the returns and tabulating the second
choice votes, but as it was learned
that the board could not possibly get
through before sometime today, The
News is sending out the unofficial re
turns, enough of which have been
compared with the books to show that
the results will not be changed.
LI
WINS DUNE VOTE.
At a late hour last night, while can
vassing the vote in the first commis
sioners district, it was found that W.
C. Alvers had won the election by one
vote, instead of, as at first reported,
that Tucker had won by one vote over
Alvers. The error was found in the
ueorgetown precinct. The original
report from that district gave Tucker
25 and Alvers nothing. In the can
vass of the returns last night it was
found that Tucker received 24 votes
and Alvers one, thus giving the elec
tion to Alvers by a majority of one
lone vote.
CATTS LEADS IN
E
Sidney J. Catts had a lead of some
2,000 votes over W. V. Knott at mid
night last night. Only some 44 coun
ties had been canvassed, and those re
maining are not regarded as strong
Catts sections. None of the second
choice votes have been counted, and
these it is generally conceded will give
the election to Mr. Knott.
Know Not "Impossible."
Know that "impossible," whore truth
and mercy and. the everlasting voice of
nature order, has no place In the brave
man's dictionary; that when all meu
have said "impossible" and tumbled
noisily elsewhither and thou nlone art
left, then first thy time and possibility
have come. It Is for thee now; do thou
that, and ask no man's counsel but thy
own only and God's. Brother, thou
hast possibility In thee for much; the
possibility of writing on the eternal
skies the record of a heroic life. Car-lyle.
His Hat Shower.
Economy in clothes would come eas
ily to some distinguished men, nota
bly the late Duke of Devonshire. The
latter clung with such affection to one
old hat which he always wore at the
races that four and twenty ladles con
spired to send him four and twenty
hats of the same style on the same
day. It is not recorded whether he
wore any of them. London Standard.
