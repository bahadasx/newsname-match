tian.
Formal charges of incom
petency, misconduct aud mis
feasance in office were pre
sented by Mayor Fawcett
against Commissioner Drake
at a special session of the
city council this afternoon.
The couucil convened in ape
.-ial session at 1:30, following a
call issued by the mayor.
Fawcett announced that the
charges had not been in his hand*
in time for presentation at the
regular morning session at 10
o'clock.
Today's charges against Drake
are virtually the same as tlu.-o
published yesterday, after tho
commissioner had obtained copies
of them from the city attorney's
office.
Fawcett Not Instigator.
Any one of those charges Is
sufficient to impeach Drake,"
said the mayor today.
"I cannot Imagine what his
motive waa in rushing into print
with charges against himself that
were of such a damning nature."
None of the counrllmen was
willing this" morning to predict
the outcome of tin Drake im
peachment proc*edings.
Fawcett insisted that he was
not the instigator of the move
ment, and that in presenting the
charges he was merely following

which provide that the mayor
shall notify the council of all
charges filed against a commis
sioner.

City Attorney Harmon declared
he knew nothing of tlie charges
that were being presented.
"A preliminary x ljst Df charges
was given me," said Harmon,
"and I began checking it over.
Then the list was withdrawn, and
I understand that a second set of
charges, more complete than the
first, was substituted. It is this
second list which will be present
ed this afternoon, f understand."
It was reported that L. Y. Stay
ton, L. E. Handley, W. B. Young
and Gabriel Wallla bad sworn to
the charges.
A movement waa started lata
yesterday by friends of Drake to
cause the Taxpayers' league of Ta
coma to investigate the nature of
tho charges, and the motives of
those persons who were Institut
ing them.
Table Counter-Charges.
A counter-mftye against Faw
cett was started today, in the na
ture of a letter presented' to the
council by Gerald Coyle, 921
South E street, ln which an at
, tempt was made to start Impeach
ment proceedings against the
mayor.
The movement was nipped ia
the bud when Commissioner Pet
tit moved that the letter he
placed on file, without investiga
tion.

TO BUILD
FISH PIER
OF SLAG!
Carrying out suggestions
made by Tlie Times several
in.nil Its ago. Commissioner
...nu. ii today completed ..«■
--gotiations with tl.e Tacoma
Smelting Co., whereby that
concern will furnish slag
free of cost for rebuilding
the waterfront road, between
Old Tacoma und Huston, and
for the erection of a break
water and fishermen's dock
at Old Tacoma.
The smelting company, through
Manager H. Y. Walker, eagerly
seized the opportunity to dispose
of its slag. A former city admin
istration had scouted the idea.
According to arrangements
made today, the smelter will Im
mediately begin dumping slag
along the waterfront road, which
Is now built on a pile trestle.
It has enough refuse ore to fill
a space 10 feet high, 10 feet \*iile
und 250 feet long each day.
Work will be besun at the'
Rust on end of the roadway, and !
extended south towards Old Ta
coma.
The smelter will furnish ore
cars and crews.
The city's expense will be
merely the trivial one of furnish- j
Ing city water to spray the hot
slag, as prevention of fire to the
present treßtle.
After the roadway is complet
ed, work will begin on the Old
Tacoma breakwater.
This will extend north from Old
Tacoma, and will form a com
pletely protected inner harbor
for the fishing fleet and fur all
small craft that come to. Tacoma.
"It Is the finest thing that Ta
coma has obtained in many
years," said Gronen today.-
will get a permanent roadway ofj
solid rock, and it will not fldst the
city a penny.
"Besides that, we will be able
to keep the fishing fleet in Ta
coma."
