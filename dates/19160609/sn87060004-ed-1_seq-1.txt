Practical Economy
Baking powders made from alumor

than Royal Baking Powder, which is made
from cream of tartar, derived from grapes.
Alum powders are not only cheap, but
they differ greatly in leavening power.
Jjra cheap baking powder is used for a
fjlrecake and the cake turn's out a failure
there is a waste of costly materials worth

Royal Baking Powder produces the
