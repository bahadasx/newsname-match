VOL. VI. NO. 48
CUT BANK, TETON COUNTY, MONTANA, FRIDAY, JUNE 9, 1916.
Two Dollars Per Yea
Cut Bank Elevat'r
Sold This Week
Bomboy-Larson House is
Sold to Creeley
Shultz Co.
Messrs. Bomboy and Larson
this week disposed of their
elevator and all other effects
connected with same to the
Greely-Shultz company, with
headquarters at Fort Benton.
A representative of the firm
came here early in the week
and after inspecting the prop
erty made the owners a
tentative offer. The question
of selling the property had
never been discussed and
neither of the owners was in a
mood to "let go," but the offer
was such an attractive one
that they finally concluded to
sell. The deal has been closed
and a manager for the new
firm is already on the ground.
Mr. Larson, speaking with
the Pioneer Press, declared
that he had no notion of
leaving Cut Bank. He and Mr.
Bomboy made excellent returns
from their elevator investment
and both gentlemen have
abundant faith in Cut Bank's
future.
The Pioneer Press learns on
the best authority that two
more grain elevators will be |
erected here this year. It is
said that the sites have al
ready been chosen and that
work will begin about the
middle of July.
The Park Trail
While in Great Falls last
week R. L, Taft discussed with
bankers and others in the
Electric City the question of
launching a campaign to divert j
the Glacier Park travel by way
of Cut Bank instead of by way
of Robare and through the
south part of the Reservation.
The trail that way is extremely
rough and there are several
deep creeks to cross, while
travel by way of Cut Bank is
over a smooth highway, the
only difficulty encountered
being the crossing of the
Marias and while the hills of
the Marias are pretty steep,
autoists find no difficulty in
negotiating them, as compared
with the rough and rocky trail
by way of Robare. It was de
cided that a large signboard
should be placed at the point
where the roads diverge, stating
that the Cut Bank way was
much the better route. This
will have the effect of turning
tourists on the new Park-to
Park trail and other points to
the south by way of Cut Bank
and it is quite needless to say
that it will mean much during
the park season and in fact all
seasons. Cut Bank should see
that this signboard is erected
and at an early date.
Richard Teslow, manager of
the International elevator, has
been quite sick during the week.

Class Confirmed
Thursday
A class of five received the
sacrament of confirmation at
St. Margaret's Catholic church
Thursday evening, by Bishop
John P. Carroll of Helena, as
sisted by the local pastor, Rev.
Father Greven, Father Van of
Valier, Father Farrell of Kalis
pell, Father Hanna of Conrad
and Father VanAken of White
fish. The ceremony was im
pressive and the talk delivered
by the distinguished Helena
prelate was listened to by a
large assemblage, both Catholics
and non-Catholics.
Bishop Carroll congratulated
the people of Cut Bank on the
material progress evident on all
sides, the people of the Catholic
faith for their zeal and devotion
to their church and Father
Greven for his tireless labors in
advancing the spiritual and
substantial ends of his mission.
He dwelt briefly on the spirit
of bigotry and intolerance to be
found in different communities
at times and counseled his peo
ple to "turn the other cheek,"
and instead of resenting it, to
endeavor to interpret to others
the true spirit and purpose of
Mother Church.
The following received the
sacrament of Confirmation: Ber
nice Bowman, Bernard and
Alice Hilla, June Madison and
Loretta Chasse.
Aleck's in "Mizzu"
Alex Richards departed Tues
day evening for his old home
near St. Joseph, Mo., where he
expects to spend about a month.
Alex has not visited the todd
ling grounds of his childhood
for nigh on forty years and it is
certain that he will be given a
hearty welcome by his old com
rades in "Mizzu." We can pic
ture him sitting in the corner
grocery, whittling pine sticks
with the old boys and regaling
them with lurid stories of In
juns, train bandits, dare-devil
cowpunchers and other bold,
villainous border characters,
out here in the fuzzy west.

CUT BANK PREPARING
A REAL CELEBRATION

Committees Actively at Work and a Fine
Program of Shorts is Now Being Arranged
Definite arrangements have been perfected
for celebrating July Fourth in Cut Bank and
the promoters assert that it will be bigger,
better and funnier than any previous celebra
tion in this section of the "Best West."
The program of amusements has not yet
been completed. There will be a meeting
next Tuesday evening, at the Pioneer Press
office, when it is hoped the members of the
different committees named below will be
present and the amusement program definitely
arranged.
The business interests of the city, big and
little, have subscribed quite generously for
the "senews" to carry out the program and
the committees will not be handicapped for
funds. About $400.00 has already been sub
scribed.
Browning will have no celebration this year,
we understand. The baseball team of the
Agency town will play here on that day and
there will be other attractions for the people
of the Reservation. It is quite safe to say that
Cut BanK will entertain the largest crowd on
Independence Day ever seen here. Large
bills giving an outline of the principal events
will soon be posted. Following are the com
mittees chosen to carry out the program:
General Committee: H. G. Putt, A. H.
Heiland, N. Macaulay.
Marshal of the Day: T. J. Connolly.
Committee on Speakers: R. C. Rasmussen,
Martin Jacobson, S. J. Rigney.
Committee on Street Sports: Sam Dunbar,
Wilson Knapp, J. C. Benish.
Committee on Auto "Parade: T. J. Larson,
F. H. Worden, Chance Lewis.
Committee on Baseball: Carl Hawkins,
Cadv Platts, R. L. Taft.
Committee on Bucking Contest and Horse
Racing: Lloyd Callison, A. J. Miller, Jack
Whittecar.
Committee on Motorcycle Race: M. S.
Bush, G. C. Putt and P. C. Bulen.
W. C. T. U. Has Board Has a Very
I
Successful Session Harmonious Meet
The second county convention
of the W. C. T. U. in Teton
county brought in an attendance
of about seventy-five visitors
in addition to the local union.
There were fine delegations
from Cut Bank, Conrad, Valier,
Bynum, Dutton and Collins.
The business session -was
held at the Methodist church
Wednesday afternoon when
reports were read from the
various local unions. The re
ports showed a remarkable in
crease in membership through
out the country, and very
satisfactory conditions gener
ally.
Mrs. Alderson, the state presi
dent, was present and ad
dressed the convention, bring
ing a very encouraging account
of conditions throughout the
state.
A big feature in connection
with the convention was the
j?rand gold medal contest held in
the evening, under the direction
of Mrs Ida F. Waterman, who
has charge of the contest work
in the county and is one of the
state organizers. The contest
was one of unusual merit. Mr.
Glen Thompson, of Choteau,
who won a diamond medal in
Illinois, also gave a reading,
and together with Mrs. Taft, of
Cut Bank, and Mrs. Toutch, of
Valier judged the declamations.
The medal, a very handsome
gold one was awarded to Paul
Sandberg, of Collins.
The ladies of the union serv
ed luncheon and also six o'clock
The county commissioners
concluded a two-day session
here on Saturday evening,
after listening to a number of
requests and suggestions con
cerning roads in this section.
Saturday morning the Teton
and Toole county boards went
down to the Marias river
below the Russel ranch. It
was decided to defer action on
this matter for the present.
Considerable improvement will
be made on what is known as
the International Boundary
road, due north of Cut Bank,
which has been in greater need
of improvement than any
other highway hereabouts.
There were very few ' kicks"
or protests of any kind reg
istered at this special session.
The road improvement work
done in this section in the past
year has been quite satisfactory
in fact those who have asked
for changes and improvements
that were within reason and
not effecting the rights of others
have had their demands ac
ceeded to. Neighbors have
been able to compromise their
conflicting opinions and to work
toward a common end; better
roadways ar.d shorter roadways
leading to and from town.
Commissioner Jacobson has
taken a keen interest in the
work, has given much of it his
personal attention and deserves
more than a little praise for
helping to solve many intricate
problems. The road improve
ment this year seems to be pro
Local Couple Are
Wed at Butte
When Frank VanDemark
journeyed to Great Falls last
week his sole and only object
was not that of an ambassador
to the Get-Together luncheon.
Van confided the secret to a
few friends, then the secret
became an open secret. Some
say it has not been a secret
for some time, but, anyhow, to
the climax.
The day following the ban
quet Mr. VanDemark and Miss
Eva Salisbury went from Great
Falls to Butte and that evening,
Friday, June 2, were united in
marriage. The announcements
were received by Cut Bank
friends early in the week and
on Tuesday evening Mr. and
Mrs. VanDemark retuned to
Cut Bank, to receive the
congratulations of many local
friends. Th^re were dark and
brooding threats of a charivari
that evening, but Van, being a
pretty astute politician, forstall
ed the event by investing
liberally in the best brands of
Havanas to be had.
Mr. and Mrs. VanDemark
will have the cordial good
wishes of the people here.
Frank has been here long
enough to be enrolled among
the "pioneer citizens" and has
been a spirited worker for the
progress of town and com
munity. Mrs. VanDemark
taught two very successful
terms of school here and enjoys
the esteem of all our people.
The Pioneer Press joins with
the public in expressing its
best wishes to our latest newly
weds:'*
No Excuse for " Willie"
Next time a weary William
with downcast mein and a
tough luck story comes to
your rear door in search for a
hand-out, present him with
this information:
Inability of the Milwaukee
to secure white men for con
struction on the Agawam branch
out of Lewistown has resulted
in the importation of 400 ne
groes from Kansas City.
Superintendent Whiting of the
Milwaukee says if he had
1,000 men he could give every
one of them a job at good
wages but that panhandlers are
loafing around Great Falls and
Lewistown begging from pass
ers-by in preference to earning
a living. Orders for more ne
groes have been placed in the
south.
Charles Peterson, the big
rancher from the Milk River
country, is a Cut Bank visitor
this week.
Ladies in Politics
Mrs. Rose Rust, state organ
izer of Woman's Democratic
Clubs, was here this week.
Mrs. Rust authorized Mrs.
Reddan to organize a local
branch and will be here at a
later date.

Big Increase in Blooded
Cattle on Blackfeet
Reserve
The Blackfeet reservation,
admittedly one of the finest
cattle sections of Montana, is
becoming one of the centers in
the state for pure bred stock, a
development that is interesting
in view of the visit here last
week of a delegation from Cut
Bank seeking the aid of Great
Falls in opening a part of the
reservation for settlement.
Charles Devereaux broke the
ice last fall when he shipped
in a carload of registered Short
Horn bulls. This spring a
number of other progressive
cattlemen visited southern and
eastern states and brought
some very fine specimens of
pure bred Hereford and Gal
loway cattle.
The leaders in this movement
were J. J. Galbreath, Charles
Bird. Mr. Vanderpool alone
purchased 16 head of registered
Hereford heifers. Mr. Galbreath
bought most of his bulls from
the famous E. L. Dana herd at
Parkman, Wyoming. Dana is
noted as a great breeder of
Hereford cattle, and has the
finest and largest pure bred
herd of range cattle in the west.
The bulls which he sold to Mr.
Galbreath are closely connected
with Perfection Fairfax, an
animal valued at $1000.
Other Blackfeet cattlemen
who have jtteUed with pure
bred stock with which to build
their herds are Patsy Higgins,
James Stone, Eddie Gobert,
Thomas Aubrey and W. E.
Haggerty. The government
has also recently shipped in 80
head of pure bred Hereford
bulls.
The tribal herd now numbers
about one hundred head, most
ly bulls.
With the start which has
been made the Blackfeet
country will soon rival any
section in Montana for pure
bred cattle.
Mrs. H. M. Keenholts and
little daughter left this week
for the Twin cities and other
Minnesota points, where they
will visit for an indefinite time.
H. G. Stevens of Havre was
a C ut Bank visitor today, ad
vertising the Havre Stampede.
