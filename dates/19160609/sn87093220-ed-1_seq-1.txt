Strength," and he urged his young
hearers to develop all their faculties
to the utmost extent that they might
become better men and women after
they grew up. A good musical pro

EIGHT PAGES
BETTER LUMBER
SHIPMENT THAN
MADE YEAR AGO
Grays Harbor Record for May Exceeds
That Made In Past 17
Months
The movements of lumber from
Grays Harbor in May was stronger
than for any month since November,
1914. While figures are not yet avail
able for rail shipments, the shipments
by sea, 32,241,000 feet, constitute a
record for the 17 months preceding.
June shipments total, undoubtedly, will
be affected by the longshoremen's
strike, whether that is settled soon or
whether it lasts for some time.
The rail shipments, it is figured, are
holding up well enough to make 1916,
if the good record continues, one of
the best years ever experienced by
the lumber trade on Grays Harbor.
Lackey Will Help
Simplified Spelling
Board in Its Work
Alexander lackey, son of Mrs.
Gertrude Lackey of this city, and a
member of the graduating class of
Reed's college, Portland, has been
given a position as assistant on the
simplified spelling board, which sits
in New York. Lackey departed yes
terday frfom Portland for his new
work, which he figures will allow
him time to attend Columbia univer
sity in the fall.
EVANGELIST NOW
USES AUDITORIUM
The big auditorium of the First
Methodist church was thrown open,
Wednesday night, for the first time
since the building of the edifice, and
Evangelist Godwin conducted his ser
vices there. The auditorium has a
large seating capacity, and 800 seats
now are installed for Godwin's audi
ences. The attendance at the evangel
ist's meetings continues to grow. It
was due to that growth that it was
found necessary to open the big audi
torium.
BEGINNERS' SHOOT
A beginners' trap shoot will be
held at Cosmopolis June 25 by the
Grays Harbor Trapshootlng associa
tion and the Grays Harbor Rod & Gun
club. High score , will be rewarded

DISTRICT HAS 2806
The completed Aberdeen school
census shows that there are 2806 of
school age in the district, a gain of
147 over last year's showing. It is
a gain of 298 over the census of
1914.
Irvin Cobb on Kentucky.
In tiie American Magazine Irvln S.
Cobb, writing on his native state. Ken
tucky, says:
"It has been alleged, and not without
some color of plausibility, that Ken
tuckians are belligerent by nature. We
do not deny It. The crest of our state
shows two gentlemen In swallow fork
coats, holding each other firmly by the
right hand. The intent of the picture
is plain. So long as they both hold
hands neither can reach for his hard
ware. The motto which goes with this
device Is, 'United we stand, divided we
fall to." By an oversight, the designers
left off the word 'to' from the end of
the phrase. It has been deemed advis
able to add It here."
If men were as eager to die
cover good as evil and had the
same delight in spreading the
report of it, if good examples
were made public as the bad
ones always are, the world
would be better for it.—Mar
montel.
Handel as a Child.
George Frederick Handel, the son of
a Saxon barber and valet, was only five
years old when his "fingers wooed di
vine melodies" from the spinet, which
a good natured aunt had smuggled for
him into an attic, so that no sound of
it might reach,the ears of his father.
At eight his playing so astonished the
elector of Saxony that his father was
compelled to withdraw his opposition
and allow the genius of the boy to
have fair play. And before he had
reached his twelfth birthday young
Handel was known throughout Ger
mauy as a brilliant composer and vir
tuoso at the court of the emperor.—

One of the best stories of Judge Par
ry, a famous English jurist, related to
a feeble looking man who was rebuked
for supporting a ridiculous claim made
by his wife. "I tell you candidly I
don't believe a word of your wife's
story," said Judge Parry.
"Yer may do as yer like." replied the
man mournfully, "but I've got to."
It was once the doubtful privilege
of Judge Parry to overhear the com
ments of two men against whom he
had decided. " 'E's a fool, but 'e did
'is best," was the verdict of these dis
appointed suitors. "One might sleep
under an unkinder epitaph," was the
philosophic comment of the judge.—

That's the record for the

the Grays Harbor county audi
tor.
Last Saturday, the fees for
recording the 105 permits is

PULP COMES
FROM LITTLE
KNOWN WOOD
Experiments by Government Show
West Has Many Trees-That
Are Valuable.
That satisfactory wood pulp can be
made from a number of heretofore
little known woods is evidenced by
a government publication just issued,
which contains seventy samples of
paper manufactured by different pro
cesses, chiefly from woods hereto
fore unused for this purpose.
The tests showed that eleven new
woods give promise of being suit
able for the production of news print
paper, while a number of others will
produce manila paper and boxboards.
Most of these woods are confined to
the West, while the ground-wood in
dustry now obtains the bulk of its raw
materials from the East. It is now
thought that pulp-making plants must
eventually move to points where they
can obtain a plentiful supply of wood
and an abundance of cheap water
power, two prime requisites in the
business.

that material now being housed in the
Stevens warehouse at H and River

staves must be moved up the Wishkah
river and distributed along the pipe
line route, as well.
BLACK CATS WIN
DOUBLE-HEADER
The Aberdeen Black Cats last Sun
day defeated Raymond, in a double
header played at Raymond, 7-6 and

mainly through bad errors made by
their opponents.
ELECTRICIANS EASY
The Aberdeen Electricians fell
easy victims last Sunday, to the Ab
erdeen Elks' baseball team, in a game
at Electric park, the Elks winning 18

Two charters for San Pedro taken
this week indicate an advance of 50
cents a thousand in coastwise freight
rates. The steamer Bowdoin was char

Coaster from Coos Bay at $6.75, both
for San Pedro; the rate being 50

Matthews Shipbuilding company's
yards in Hoquiam for the Hart-Wood
and E. K. Wood Lumber companies".
The veteran mariner is making his
home at the Elks' club in Hoquiam.
WHALE AT OYEHUT
A whale, estimated to weigh close
to 20 tons and measuring 40 feet,
washed ashore this week three miles

any of the Grays Harbor beaches.

SIX BIDDERS
ON BUILDING
OF PIPE LINE
Council Considers Offer
to Construct Big
Project
BEGIN SOME PAVING
Ordinances Passed Pro
viding for Improving
Streets
Consideration of bids for the Wish
kah water project occupied the city
council at its regular session Wed
nesday night and at an adjourned ses
sion last night. At the former ses
sion, too, many street improvements
were discussed and action taken on
some.
Six bidders appeared for the Wish
kas project, the Pearson Construc
tion company, George P. Wright of
Tacoma, Peterson & Co. of Seattle,
Oregon Engineering & Construction
company, Holt & Jefreys and P. E.
McHugh of Tacoma. Whether one of
these bids be accepted or whether
the city does the work, as planned
last year, by day labor, the work
likely will cost about $200,000, with
another $200,000 or so for material.
In future the mayor and city clerk
will be allowed to pay for carloads
of steel bands for the pipe line as
they arrive in Aberdeen and are
checked by the city engineer. The
council gave such authorization, on
the showing that shipments might be
tied up here with demurrage charges
accruing, otherwise.
An ordinance was passed, limiting
the speed of motor vehicles crossing
any bridge in the city to eight miles
an hour. An ordinance amending the
ordinance regulating sale and use of
fireworks, to include prohibition of
skyrockets on streets, was referred a
week to the city attorney.
Resolutions were adopted providing
for paving Market street from Jef
ferson to Washington, and from
Washington to Division, the latter im
provement not to be started until next
spring, and setting protest date aa
July 5. A resolution was adopted for
paving M street from Third to the
foot of the hill. Contract for build
ing the Wishkah road through the
Stewart property was let to August
Wallin. It was decided to gravel the
road, within the city, connecting with
the new road to Junction City, on
Dr. W. B. Paine's promise to pay the
$550 the work will cost, the city to
reimburse him out of next year's bud
get allowances. An ordinance, pro
viding for drainage ditches in the.
West end was passed.
LONGSHOREMEN
DECIDE TO KEEP
UP BIG STRIKE
There seems no immediate proba
bility of the longshoremen's strike end
ing. The Pacific Coast district board
of the International Longshoremen's

San Francisco, announced that there
would be no cessation of the strike
until the employers shall have granted
the union's demands. Locally, the
strike has been maintained with no
disturbance to date.
