RESTA WON
Triumph of Resta at Indianopolis, Staying
Quality of Tires
"The expeoted happened at the In
dianopolis raoes," says a Goodrioh of
floial, "Resta, the favorite, in a Peugeot,
equipped with Silvertown Tires won
the 300 mile Speedway Sweepstakes
with plenty to spare.
"Aside from Resta's wonderful driv
ing and the unusual meohanical per
faction of the Peugeot car, the feature
of the great raoe was the stamina and
staying qualities of Silvertown tires.
"Seventeen oat ot twenty-two entries
were Silvertowns. The first three oar* Glattly Lumber Oo.
at the finish were Silvertown equipped,
and each oar only made one stop in
300 miles. Resta and Mulford both
said that it was not necessary for them
to make the one tire change, but that,
having stopped for other reasons, they
took the time and precaution of
changing one tire.
"Resta said after the 300 mile drive
that races used to be a battle of tires,
and the driver who was fortunate
enough to go through with but few
tire changes won the race But now
with the time tested Silvertowns, tire
troubles and blowouts have been prac
tically eliminated. The Goodrich
Company has made it possible for oars
to develop 100 miles or more per hour
with safety.
"D'Aleoe, who was seoond in his
Ouesenberg, was enthusiastic over
Silvertown tire servioe. 'You cannot
make my endorsement of Silvertowns
for road driving or racing too Btrong,
he said. 'The race today shows there
never waB a better tire made than
Silvertowns.' Ralph Mulford, who was
third in his Peugeot, aaid, 'I have al
ways been a Silvertown booster. Last
year I went through the Chicago 300
mile race without a tire change. Re
cently, I broke the world's twenty four
hour record with but one tire change In
1800 miles, with the Hudson Super-Six
with Silvertowns all around. Silver
towns give your oar more speed with
less motor power, save gasoline, and
eliminate all ordinary tire trouble.'
Mrs. Dario Resta attended the raoes
in her Premier equipped with the
olassy black tread Silvertowns. 'Be.
sides giving better servioe,' Mrs. Resta
said, 'Silvertowns give my oar a olassy
appearance, and make it ride easier.'
"The drivers, before and after the
raoes, commented on the sportsman
ship offer made by The 8. F. Goodrioh
Company, of $10,000 prizes to the
champion drivers of America. 'At
first we thought it was neoessary for
us to use Silvertowns in order to be
eligible for the prize,' said one of the
drivers, 'but we find that the Goodrioh
Co. will give the prize to the be»t
driver, regardless of the tires used.'
From the-comments made as a result
of the great Bhowing made by Silver
towns yesterday, the drivers think it
will be many a day before a tire is
made that will equal the Silvertown
for all around road and traok efficiency.
Most of the drivers with their oars left
Tuesday night to tune up their cars
for the Chioago 300 mile Speedway
Race, June 10."

for each man, woman and child in tbe
state to $400.08.
It may be well questioned whether
any other state anywhere has ever
made such a record as this.
The last assessment of property in
the state was $1,280,000,000 which
amount, if divided eqially among our
population, would make $2,133.33 for
each man, woman and child, or 810.666,.

The April oali of bank deposits show

male quartette composed of Dr. L. E,
Eaton, A Stewart, John Taylor and
RoyJuckett. Professor Riohart next
introduced the speaker of the evening,
in tbe person of Professor Thom, of
the University of South Dakota.
Mr. Thom is easily one of the best
speakers ever heard on the platform in
this city and he held tbe attention of
the audience for one hour with a
speech that was both eloquent and full
of good common sense. His advice to
the graduates should be followed by
eveiy person, the thought running
through the entire talk, that we should
always aim high in this world even tho
we never reaohed the goal but in the
effort we would all beoome better men

Superintendent Fawell then made a
few appropriate remarks and intro
