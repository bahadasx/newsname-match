GREAT SHORTAGE
IN HORSE MARKET
Government Buys Two Year Old
Colts. European Nations Have
Enormous Standing Orders
"We are having the greatest
famine in horses that was ever
known," said C. W. Bowers, of
Ruby & Bowers, well known horse
dealers, of Davis, California, on
his visit to Deming Tuesday. Mr.
Bowers is bringing in a carload of
stallions, which are at Lordsburg,
and after making some sales there
he will unload in Deming. He
makes this trip every season, go
ing as far east as Roswell and
then doubling back to the coast
over the Santa Fe Railway.
"I met," he says, "six govern
ment buyers in Phoenix alone last
week, and no limit has been placed
on the number of animals which
they are allowed to purchase. 11
may not be generally known, but
the United States is now buying
two year old colts fifteen hands
high, and is paying flOO each for
them. The authorities are tak
ing no chances of running short,
so will do their own developing
and conditioning themselves. You
know thai the horse business was
terribly neglected, because people
thought that owing to the great
use and demand for automobiles.
and the perfecting of the gas en
gine, that there would never be
any use for horses again, and as
a result we arc now having the big
gest horse famine ever recorded,
and we expect to see it continue for
the next five years; at least. The
price of stallions alone has ad
vanced practically $300. Euro
pean nations have standing orders
in this country calling . for as
many as 250,000 horses alul
mules."
