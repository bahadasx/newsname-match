-cheers and shouts of "Hughes" in
"Bap, rap, rap" meter.
Ten minutes of demonstration

times it died down only to be revived.
Some of the New Yorkers sat down

The demonstration ebbed and flowed.
Kansps, New Jersey, California and
Tennessee' men then took up the
cheers.

ing if emergency altered the situation.
Big Hall Jammed.
At 11 Chairman Harding rapped for
order. Mr. Handing urged the delegates
to be seated quickly. The big hall was
more crowded than on any other day.
The prospect of nominations brought in
the crowd.
The delegates of the favorite sons
states came prepared with flags and
nojse making machines for the nols*

offered prayer.

peace conferees. It follow*:
"To the republican national conven
tidn: Your committee appointed pur
suant to the resolution adopted at yes
terday's session met in conference with
a committee from tfie national pro
gressive, convention last evening. The
progressive committee consisted of
Messrs. Perkins of New York Johnson,
of .California Bonaparte, of Maryland
WUkinson, of New York, and Parker, of
Louisiana,
"The conference was frank, free and
most friendly. The conferees were of
one mind in believing that the good of
the country and perhaps its repute and
Influence for years to come depends
upon the complete defeat of the present
democratic administration and the res
toration of the control of the executive
and legislative branches of the govern
ment to the hands of those who firhily
believe in and will execute the policy
that afe so heartily supported by the
republican and progressive parties
alike.
"The progressive committeemen were
unanimous in urging in fairness the
opinion that Theodore Roosevelt, of
Mew York, had so large a personal fol
as to make him the moat desir
-rf&le candidate upon which to unite.
-T?lt was agreed that your conferees
W „i Af s, -i

would report Ihese fa«ts to this con
vention.
"Respectfully submitted,..^

"W, Murray Crane.
"W. E. Borah,,
"Nicholas Murray Butler.
"A. R. Johnson."
Applause, Cheers and Hisses.
The announcement that-the confer
ence was "frank, free and friendly"
was applauded. Wneh Mr Smoot an
nounced that the progressives had
urged Mr. Roosevelt as the most de
sirable candidate, there was applause,
cheers and some hisses.
There were cries of "Roosevelt,"
jangling of cowbells and more cheers).
Senator Smoot held up his hands for
silence but the demonstratipn con
tinued. Some few tried to hiss d'own
the demonstration. At cries of "Order,
order," Chairman Harding banged the
gavel and the noise subsided. Scatter
ing applause and some laughter
marked the cloee of the reading.
Nominations Begin.
Then came the big business of the
convention—the nominating of candi
dates. The roll of states was called.
Arizona yielded to New- York. An Ari
zona member challenged the yielding
and the delegation was polled. _The
"ayes" had it and Governor Whitman,
of New York, was recognized, and took
the platform to nominate Justice
Hughes. The demonstration subsided
while Governor Whitman began to
speak.
The governor went on to a denunclj
ation of President Wilson's foreign
policy and a declaration that the pros
perity of the country was only tem
porary and wholly dependent on the
war.
There was a demonstration when
Governor Whitman mentioned the
name of W. H. Taft. The delegates
rose cheering and. waving their hats.
It was the longest demonstration of
the convention so far.
Points to Old SpeocH.
When It showed no signs ofidying
away the cheers leaders started it up
again and it was, six minutes before
Governor Whitman resumed. A mem
ber of the peace conference committee
said the demonstration was regarded
as "unofficial instructions."

e^ht year speech of Justice Hughes
declaring for "adequate defense and
maintenance of the army and navy"

The Hufhes men leg the cheering.
The other delegates from the favorite
sons' states for the most part kept

Twenty Minutes ef Noise.
Governor Whitman reached' his pero
ration at 12 Ml o'clockV A man oh the
platform started, "Hughes, Hughes,
Hughes, wfe want Hughes," and the en
thusiasts caught the point and took
up the shout. When the noise had
been in fiitl sway for twenty minutes,
the chairman recognized Nicholas
Murray Butler, of New-York, to nomi
nate Ellhu Root, under yield of place
by Arizona.
Root is Presented.
In placing before the convention the
name of Mr. Root as a presidential no
minee, MrTTButler said:
"To be elected president of the Unit
ed States I shall nominate him, who by
common' cfnseat, stands with the fore
most statesmen of his time in this or
any other land."
After outlining what he said was the
unrest, uncertainty and.grave concern
for the morrow, whicK extended thru
out the country, Mr. Butler said:
"Jus" now every difficulty, every
problem merges into one. That is the
problem, that is the difficulty of finding
the voice and executing, the will of real
America. May we not call to our side
for the accomplishment of this task all
patriotic Americans, men and women
alike, whose faith
mky
at all times be
different frdm Ours, but who see the
compelling power of the one great prob
lem and the one greqt need of the mo
ment.
"It is my privilege to offer you the
name of a typical American whose
public services now in the ripe full
ness of their power his brought him
fame and distinction such as fall to the
lot of few men in aoenturjr."

PEACE CONFERENCE
MAY BE RESUMED
Moosers Offer Name of Roosevelt Only,
and Republican Conferees Suggest
No Candidate—Radical Delegates In
sistent on Immediate Aotion^Adopt
Party Platform, Plank by Plank, to
Kill Time—Would Avoid Stampede.
Auditorium, Chicago .June 9.—A re
port of the peace conference appointed
by the progressive national convention
was read to the delegates today by
Chairman George W. Perkins and at
the same hour the republican confer
ence committee was making its report
at the Coliseum.
The reports were not identical but
they agreed the name of Colonel
Roosevelt was the only one which the
progressives presented to the repub
licans, and the latter offered no name.
Both reports recommended time for
further conferences "this afternoon
this evening."
For an hour the progressive dele
gates' had been listening to the reading
of the platform. The radicals had been
straining at the leash. They had been
restrained only by the .statement Of
Chairman Robins that the report of
the conference committee was coming
very soon.
After listening to the report. and
listening to the appeali of" Mr. Perkins
to let the convention go back to work
the delega.tes' began a great demon
stration.
Little Hope For Agreement.
Governor Johnson then sounded a
note of pessimism in the call for peace
by telling the progressives not to place
too much confidence in the expression
concerning Colonel Roosevelt in the
republican-report. His remarks voiced
the fears of the radicals that there
was little prospect for an agreement
between the two conventions, but his
name on the report would guarantee
a continuance of the conferences.
When 10 o'clock, the hour for recon
vening the progressive convention ar
rived, there was not & leader on the
platform. There was little enthusiasm
among the arriving delegates, altho the
band did its best to liven things v\p.
Likened to Powder Magazine,
The officers of the convention, who
were attempting to proceed in a de
liberate manner, realized that their
work was cut out for them.
Henry Allen's description that if
was a powder magazine with lots of
matches around yesterday adequately
described the situation, today. The
auditorium was filled with powder sure
enough and conservatives could only
hope that no spark would light the ex
plosives.
From a parliamentary point of view
the officers had the advantage over
the delegates who would rush madly
into making the .nomination of Roose
velt.
Kill Time.
Yesterday the platform report was
placed before the convention by Dean
William Draper Lewis, of the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, chairman of the
resolutions committee, and it was made'
the unfinished business. Those seek-'
ing delay to give the peace' committee,
time looked eagerly for a Roosevelt
demonstration. They were prepared
when It came and to keep it going as
long as possible.
Unrestrained enthusiasm of uncon
trollable Roosevelt shouters would be
an element in favor of those who would
delay making a nomination, for thje
demonstration would help use up the
time.
The plan was to bring up the plat
form and open it to unlimited debate
if necessary as soon as the convention
demanded proceeding to nominations.
As leaders talked the delegates
poured in. The Massachusetts dele
gates came in shouting, "We'd better
nominate Roosevelt before it's too
late."
A male quartet with megaphones in
a balconyn. the band and a Utah dele-,
gate armed with a flute had a musical
duel.
"Thertfll. Be. a Hot Time In the Old
Town Tpnignt" caught the delegates'
fancy.
Delegates Likely to Stampede.
William Allen White and Glfford Pin
chot after moving about among- the del
egates reported that the convention
could not be restrained and the momeiit'
word came'from the Coliseum that the
republicans were nominating a candi
date it was the determination of* the
progressives to place their candidate
in the field first Colonel RoOsevelt, it
was said would be named by acclama-*
tion, but wtih a roll call.
It was 10:2-6 a. m. when Chairman
Robins called the convention to order.
The delegates' seats were filled but the
galleries were not.
The opening prayer was. glvn by Rab
bi Josph Stals of Chicago.

MARSHALLTOWN, IOWA, FRIDAY, JUNE 9, 1916.
'i{.i a •"& .iffc *•*, a, A
Delegate Charles E. Mason, of Maine
was recognized- to offer seats on the
floor to the Georgia delegation, seated
at the rear of the state, referring to,
Georgia as "the home of Teddy's
mother."
Business was halted while the
Maine and Iowa delegations mounted
the stage to exchange seats with the
Georgians who went to the main floor.
The crowd cheered loudly, the band
played "Dixie" and the Georgians sang
a verse.
Adopt Platform by Planks.
Chairman Robins announcd that
the report on the peace conference was
not quite ready, and brought up the un
finished business and the platform, to
be read plank bjv plank by Dean Wil
liam Draper Lewis, chairman of the'
resolutions committee. The chairman
ruled that the planks should be taken
up in order and each plank approved
when the reading was finished. He said
final adoption would be deferred until
after the planks had met approval.
All of the first paragraphs of the
platform were approved later para
graphs were approved by unanimous
consent, shortening the Routine pro
cess.
The planks on "Americanism" were
approved without dissenting voice and
without applause. Mt. Lewis, holding
an Indiana ,prxy offered an amend
ment to the Mexican plank to include
criticism of the "murder" of Americans
on the high seas. The amendment read:
"Failure to deal firmly and promptly
With the menace of Mexican disorder
and threatened violations of the rights
of our citizens on the high seas has re
sulted in wanton murder of our citi
zens and the tragic weakening of our
national respect." The amendment was
approved.
Attend Suffrage piank.
Judge W. L. Ransom, of New York, a
member of the resolutions committee,
proposed to add to the clause of the
suffrage plank reading "to all man
kind in all nations," the following: "We
pledge ourselves not to conclude a
treaty with Russia or any other coun
try that will not expressly procure such
absolute rights."
Many cries of "No, no," greeted the
Ransom amendment. Chester Rowell,
of California, of the resolutions com
mittee, opposed writing details into
planks, saying the committee had
framed the-platform in broad general
terms. A new amendment by Judge
Ransom was substituted. It read:
"We sbouia not copciude. a treaty
with. any. country that will riot express
ly assure to American citizens absolute
rights." The substitute *Vas approved
with a roar riftsfppjause.
Report of ..Conference Committee.
Thte' peace conference committee,
headed by George W. Perkins and Gov
ernor Johnson arrived at 11:30 and the
platform was laid aside. Mr. Perkins
after a burst of applause presented the
peace conferees report. It follows:
"To the progressive national con
vention:
"Your committee appointed pursuant
to the resolution adopted at yester
day's session met in conference with
the committee representing ithe na
tional republican convention last even
ing, The committee of conference rep
resenting the republican convention
consisted of Messrs. Reed Smoot, W.
Murray Crane, William E. Borah,
Nicholas Murray Butler and A. R.
Johnson.
"The conference was most friendly.
Immediately upon assembling your
committee proposed as the joint nomi
nee of both conventions the name of
Theodore Roosevelt. The committee
representing the republican national
convention did not present the name
of any candidate nor did it refute the
desirability of Colonel Roosevelt to
serve our party and our country. No
concrete proposition was advanced by
the republican conferees except that
for a further conference might be de
sirable this afternoon or evening.
"George W. Perkins,
"Hiram W. Johnson,
"Charles J. Bonaparte,
"John M. Parker,
"Horace S. Wilkinson."
When Mr. Perkins told how Colonel
Roosevelt's name had been presented
there was short loud applause. Yells
and cheers followed the statement that
the republicans presented no candi
date.
"Hooray," and "Good" the delegates
shouted.
Perkins Counsels Calmness.
There was little applause when the
reading of the report was concluded.
Mr. Perkins' gestures In reading the
republican report indicated his ap
proval and hope of party harmony.
The statement that the progressives
had urged the name of Roosevelt
evoked prolonged cheering. Chairman
Robins reread the republican report
and silent attention then prevailed.
Mr. Perkins pleaded with the con
vention to keep calm and cool headed.
"We must do nothing to mar the rec
ord so we can appeal to the voters if
that Is the final result," he said. "We
will not get our party In such a posi
tion that we caffi not move out clear,
strong and courageous to whatever
kind of a campaign we may go."
Governor Johnson was called to re
late his part In the conferences.
"I wouldn't for the world dampen
any man's enthusiasm," he said, "but
do not place too much confidence In
the republicans' report.
"The sum total of the case was that
the progressives 'made the issue of
this campaign and they offer the man.'
"The republicans accept the issue
and admit it In conference that they
have no (man to suggest except Theo
dore Roosevelt."
Stand For One Man.
Governor Johnson stirred the con
vention Into another demonstration
when he declared he would stand to
the end for one man and one man
alone, "the greatest American."
As" Mr. Bonaparte was about to
speak Chairman Robins said he un
drestood the republican convention
had continued their peace committee.
Hegry Allen said when the republican
committee report was made there was
"applause from galleries and from the
delegates except 100 gripped their

Bank of River Meuse.
London, June 9.—Information has
reached the Russian embassy at Rome
that the Austrian front has been com
pletely broken along a length of ninety
four miles to a depth of 37% miles, ac
cording to a Central News dispatch to
day. The Russian advance, according
to these advices, now^threatens to en
velop the entire Austrian army.
Austrian Slav regiments are declared
to have been seized with panic during
the first attacks by the Russians and
to have surrendered without any real
resistance.
GERMANS IN GREAT ATTACK.
Launch General Offensive on Front
Along Right Bank of Meuse.
Paris, June 9.—The Germans have
launched a general attack along the en
tire front on the right bank of the
Meuse and have penetrated the French
line at one point, but were repulsed
everywhere with heavy losses, accord
ing to a war office statement.
The point where the Germans en
tered the French lines is near the
Thiaunoont farm. The Germans also
made two small attacks southwest o£
Hill No. 304, but. these attacks were re
pulsed.
WASHED ASHORE ON RAFT.
Finding of Hampshire Survivors Re
vives Hope There May Bo-Others.
London, June 9.—Twelve men from
the cruiser Hampshire, sunk west of
the Orkney islands, with Lord Kitch
ener and his staff, have reached shore
on a raft. This announcement was
made last night by the admiralty,
which issued a list of the names Of
the twelve men.
Altho neither the name of Lord
Kitchener nor of any of his party ap
pears on the list, the news that there
were survivors was received with ex
pressions of relief, for now at least
the story of the sinking of the cruiser
and the loss of the secretary of state
for war will be told.
Up to the present e\'en the admir
alty had no information as to the
cause of the sinking of the vessel ex
cept that it was the result of the ex
plosion of either a mine or tomedo.
When the men saved on the raft which
was washed Stshore yesterday are able
to tell their story it is believed Uhat
this question will be answered.
The news, too, has again suggested
the possibility that other men on board
the Hampshire—and in this connection
the British public naturally thinks
first of Lord Kiti-hener—may also
have reached land on one of the rocky,
uninhabited islands of the Orkney
group and, tho unable to communicate
with civilization, are safe. This hope,
it is granted by those who mention it,
is of the most meager sort, with little
probability that it will he fulfilled.
A vigorous search is being prosecut
ed for the bodies of Lord Kitchener
and others aboard the Hampshire, as
well as for survivors who may have
been washed ashore among the Islands.
Several bodies. Including that of
Lieut. Col. O. A. Fitzgerald. Lord Kitch
ener's military secretary, are being
seats and sat silent when the name of
Theodore Roosevelt was reached."
"We don't intend to be stampeded,"
said Mr. Robins.
More Planks Amended.
An amendment by Delegate Biddle,
of Illinois,, proposed that "the cost of
preparedness be borne by profits on
trade In munitions." The amendment
was approved.
The plank for universal military
service was loudly applauded.
Mrs. E. M. Rhodes, of Seattle, Wash
started discussion of the suffrage
plank when it was brought up, declar
ing "every male citizen Is bound to
defend his country." She was called
to the stage and moved the name
"male" be stricken out. It was ap
proved with enthusiasm.
Dean Lewis presented an amend
ment to the suffrage plank, designed
to declare "both by national and state
action," thirty women delegates sign
ing an endorsement. The adoption of
the suffrage plank in its amended
form was a proved.
The tariff commission plank led to
some discussion as to what a non
partisan commission means, but was
adopted without opposition. The con
vention then recessed t(^ 3 o'clock.
Recess Taken.
After finishing consideration of thef*
platform, but without voting for its
final adoption, the progressive national
convention recessed at 1:08 to.8 p. m.
The .conference committee was un
derstood to be watching the situation
to determine whether it was any use
to try to secure another conference

Borah Invades
Moosers Hall
Makes Speech
Chicago. June Without any pre
liminary announcement Senator Wil
liam 10. Boiah entered the hall where
the progressives were assembled. He
was escorted to the platform. A great
demonstration was given him.
The convention roared Itself hoarse
when the senator said he hod not come
elficially.
"I will say to you frankly," he said,
"I came over here to get an inspira
tion."
At once a wave swept over the hall,
suggesting that stranger events than
harmony with Borah as the*'man to
unite the parties might happen. This
thought grew as the senator in his
speech introduced the magic name of
Roosevelt.
"We want Teddy," resounded thru
the hall and galleries with more vim
than at any time since the convention
assembled. It was not "canned"'en
thusiasm or if it was the "can" had
burst from internal compression.
Senator Borah waited quietly and
ilnally Chairman Robins urged quiet.
"It is well known the deep seated
feeling I have for your leader," he be
gan—and again there wks a demon
sirs tion.
"There's no doubt you want Teddy,"
said the senator.
"We want Borah, too." answered
the delegates, and the senator pro
ceeded, swinging into the stride of his
speech, in which he promised to be
brief.
He put the quietus on the whispered
circulation of his name as a possible
"(Moses" by remindng the progressive
convention that he was present as the
member of a committee of another,
convention.
"There is not a doubt thai you want
Teddy and that millions of citizens
want Teddy," he said. "You are for
tunate in having a leader who has
done more than any other man in
making the issues of the campaign.
"But let us bear in mind that what
these two conventions do here may
mean the future of the country for
the next twenty-flve years. I must
say it is essential that before we leave
this great city it should be definitely
determined that we should march and
fight together in this great conflict."
The visit of Senator Borah was said
by Mr. Perkins to be another sign of
the friendly spirit between the two
conventions.
Mr. Perkins said he coulc not knotf
what significance could be attached to
Borah's action.
"Anyway, we're making a record for
ourselves that will set ue right before
the country'," said Mr. Perkins. 'Wo
matter what the outcomi, We've got
'em anyway."
