PRIMARY ELECTION RESULTS IN IOWA AND HOWARD COUNTY.
The primary election last Monday night brought out a record breaking vote
due to the republican contest for governer and the suffrage amendment, over
310,000 votes being cast.
The majority in the state against woman suffrage is 4655. The vote for is
150,335 and that against 154,999. This is on the authority of the Des Moines
Register. Suffrage won in Howard county by a margin of 170, not so large as
anticipated.
In the republican contest for governor, Harding secured the nomination
with Cosson second, Allen third and Kuehnle a poor fourth. It is conceded by
many republicans that the nomination of Harding insures the election of Mere
dith, the democratic candidate.
The following tables show the vote by precincts in Howard county for the
suffrage amendment and for offices of interest on the republican ballot for
which there were contests.

The Little Mother.
Coming to the Opera House, for
three nights only, the. Guy Hickman
Company direct from a three months'
run at the new Cecil Theatre at Mason
City, Joya. Mr. Hickman has selected,
for his-opening play here "The Littler
Mother."
For almost fifty years "East Lynn"
was the greatest play for women, or
until Billie Burke starred in "The Lit
tle Mother," a play for both men and
women. It was in this very play that
Billie Burke was made a star in one
night.
"The Little Mother" is a play that
every boy should take his sweetheart
to see. They will find a lesson told
through tears and laughter of young
married life that should help them over
the rough places of their future life.
At the Opera House Monday, Tues
day and Wednesday.

Basiaess Mea to Visit Cresco Jaae 15th

Railroad traffic east of Cresco is still
demoralized, and at no previous time
has high water caused so much irregu
larity and delay in the arrival of mails
at Cresco. Between Calmar and De
corah, 12 bridges and five miles of
track are washed out, and officials state
that under the most favorable circum
stances, it will still oe a week before
trains will run to Decorah. Between
Jackson Junction and Fort Atkinson,
two bridges and a half mile of track
was washed out This has been re
paired, and traffie wa^ resumed over
the- paJIMt-t
nesday. Trains are running from Cal
mar to Monona, but from Beulah to
McGregor the track is badly damaged
and several bridges out. McGregor
and North McGregor suffered terribly
the freight depot, warehouse and rail
road yards at the latter place were de
stroyed by the flood and at McGregor
much damage was done by high water
to property.
The Rock Island road between West
Union and Decorah suffered so badly
that it is doubtful if train service will
be resumed between those two points
until late in the summer.
The first reports gave accounts of
loss of life at various places, but at
Calmar occurred the only actual cases
of death by the storm, concerning
which we clip the following from the
Calmar Courier:
"From the EUend Dahlen home, just
two miles northeast of town, two lives
were sacrificed to the flood, EUend Dahl
en himself, and his maiden sister, Syn
erva, who made her home with Ellend,
both losing their lives in the flood of
water that swept through the prem
ises. Ellend, his sister and his wife's
brother, George Numedahl, were work
ing or choring out in the barn yard.
As the raia began to pour down they
went into a building that was built on
a good cement foundation, and used for
a macchine shed and hen house. This
building, although securely bolted to
the foundation, was swept away and
the occupants were soon struggling in
the raging waters.
George Numedahl finally clung to a
wire fence a quarter of a mile below
the place, and worked himself out hand
over hand along the fence to a place of
safety.
The other two were swept on down
the valley and the lifeless bodies were
found five miles below their home in
Mr. Wheatman's pasture.".
To Thomas H. lace, Maker of Pegfjr
I
must congratulate you on your won
derful production "Peggy." It is not
only the most vital but is so interesting,
so absorbing it holds you spellbound for
the full two hours of the play.

This section of the state was visited
last Thursday evening by a torrential
rain which seemed to the east of us
caused a vast amount of damage to
crops and property and the loss of two
lives near Calmar.
Decorah was visited by flood worse
than that of fourteen years ago, Dry
Run rising out of its banks in a few
minutes, a wall of water eight feet in
height sweeping down between the
hills, washing ...away railroad tracks
and bridges, carrying barns and small
buildings down stream or crushing
them, and overflowing houses with
water to ardepth of four or five feet in
many cases, leaving deposits of mud
and filth in the lower story and cellars
of practically one-third of the resi
dences in Decorah. The home of L. J.
Stoskopf was floated from its founda

across the Milwaukee tracks and
smashed against some trees. The fam

at the meeting by Fred Biermann, Edi

Trail go by way of Lawler, Calmar and
Decorah. W. H. Tillson represented
Cresco and made the claim that via
Cresco was the logical route for this
new trail. The committee decided in
favor of the Cresco route. It is ex
pected'that this Trail will be marked
within sixty days.
Cresco will be on all the auto Trail
