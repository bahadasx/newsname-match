Writer Paints Sorrowful Picture
of Trip From Lemberg
to Przemysl.
SWEPT THREE TIMES BY WAR
Only Cities Were Spared, and They
Have Recuperated With a Speed
That Would Seem Almost
Impossible.
The Hague. Lemberg and Przemysl
how long it seems since our thoughts
were concentrated on those two Ga
llelan towns! In reality It is but a
few short months. To ride from Lem
berg to Przemysl today Is to ride
through ono huge, vast churchyard.
Wherever you look you see graves.
There they lie in groups In the wilder
ness! On some are transfixed a small gray
cap or German helmet, already rot
ting. On others the rough wooden
crosses are sinking into the ground,
as though they knew the plow would
con be there. Sometimes you see
huge graves, from which many-colored
regimental flags wave vigorously
above the pitiful landscape. It is al
most as If someone were laughing In
the grave below. The only break In
this terrible churchyard is formed by
some blackened, tumbled ground, once
a village.
Such is the country over which the
fury of war has raged three times.
Only cities have been spared, and have
recuperated with, a speed which would

gay and busy as ever; Przemysl Is

for hours to such details as theBe. Do
not think the house of Stteber Is any
ordinary cafe. Its history is the his
tory of Przemysl. Long before Prze
mysl was first threatened this cafe
was the great proscenium of the war.
The battle of Lemberg, the battle of
Grodek, and a hundred other battles,
fights and skirmishes took place with
in hearing. Almost the whole Austro
Hungarian army passed the windows
of the cafe on their way east to fight
the Russians. And later, during the
first and second sieges. Cafe Stieber
was the center of this town. No one
wanted to stay at home with his own
dismal thoughts, guests could not be
received, gas there was none, and pe
troleum must be used sparingly.
Occasionally a Newspaper.
The best thing to do, therefore, was
to stick your two lumps of sugar ln
your pocket and grope through the
streets to Cafe Stieber. And then
thero was always something to read
there. In the beginning there was
even from time to time a real news
paper brought by ab aviator. Later
there was only the war bulletin, which
was slowly reduced from ordinary
white paper to the backs of paper
bags, and finally to the backs of menu
cards.
Last of all there was only one copy,
and that was on view in the Cafe Stie
ber. In the last weeks of the siege
any bit of paper in the street was ea
gerly picked up and used as a ciga
rette paper.
Nor was tobacco any too plentiful.
In February, 1915, $50 was offered for
100 cigarettes of poor quality. The
offer was refused with contempt.
And if you had tobacco and ciga
rettes you could not smoke them
where you would. For that you had to
go to Cafe Stieber. There a huge fire
burned night and day, for of wood
there was plenty, but matches were
precious Indeed. The soldiers ln the
trenches got two matches a day for
five men.

AMERICAN CARS HARD HIT
English Owners Can't Import Spare
Parts to Repair Old
Ohm.
London. A correspondent who ts
thoroughly conversant with the motor
car business sends an interesting com
munication to the Manchester Guard
ian with reference to the new reg
ulation prohibiting the importation
either of motor cars or spare parts.
The regulation affects In practice
only American cars and repair parts.
Practically no new cars are to be
bought at the present time except
American cars, and as the standard
ized self-starting American cars are
the simplest for an amateur to work a
doctor or a commercial traveler who
wants a car naturally prefers ln these
times to buy an American machine. It
seems remarkable that not even a lim
ited import Is permitted.
There are thousands of American
cars In use ln this country by doctors
and professional men, commercial trav
elers, military officers and others with
a good reason for having a car. Ap
parently, under the new regulation, as
soon as these cars need repair they
will have to be laid up, since spare
parts cannot be Imported, and It is
quite impossible to get spare parts
manufactured ln this country at the
present time.

ITALY INVENTS NEW BREAD
Method of Baking, Recently Adopted,
Said to Make Preduet More Nu
tritive and Digestible.
Rome A new method of making
bread, recently adopted in Italy, has
proved a great success. It ,1s found
that 300 pounds of grain produces 400
pounds of what is termed "natuial
bread."
In the process the grain is sifted and
washed; it la then left for 48 to 60
hours in a warm bath, where it germi
nates and begins to sprout. When the
germinating process has gone fur
onough the grain is crushed In a ma
chine and made into dough, which is
passed into the oven.
The natural bread is grayish in color,
with an agreeable odor, and has much
higher nutritive properties than white
bread, according to the Corrlere Delia
Sera. Its eating qualities and digesti
bility are shown by the preference
given it by Italians who have tried it
He who would reckon well should

Predicts Faster Bell Will Be Played
Account Large Number of Players
Thrown on Market After Fed
eral League Disbanded.
Faster ball will be played ln the
American Association during the sea
son of 1916 than in any period ln
the history of the organization. The
reason for this Is thu large number of
good players that v ore on the market
after the Federal league disbanded.
The club owners of the American
association were prompt ln taking ad
vantage of this situation, and I think
their patrons will appreciate their
energy when the season 1b under way.
It Is a fact that the Federal league
developed a large number of young
ball players, ln fact, too many for the
"icjor leagues to take care of under
the existing limitations on major
league teams in ihe number of men
they can carry..
Most of these players have come to
the American association teams and
this class of talent combined with the
best men on the teams of last year
will serve to advances the general
standard of play to a plane higher
than has been reached by any organi
zation outside the two major leagues.
That there has Leen a' decided re
vival of interest in the national sport
Is evidenced by the immense crowds
that attended 'the opening games.
Everything considered, it is but rea
sonable to anticipate that 1916 will be
the banner year of the association.
With the many changes ln the per
sonnel of the teams, any prediction as
to the final outcome of the pennant
race before the midule of the season
would be largely guesswork. Until
the different comb. nations and changes
are tested In actual play on the dia
monds during the first two months
of the season, thoir ultimate worth
and comparative ability will remain
ir doubt I look for a close race.
