HSU VILLAGE
Superintendent ; Forbes : and
Promotion. Secretary Tay-
: - lor Outfinfe Plans
.j'"'.'- -'. -
At an Infonr al conference this
morning between Superintendent
Forbes .-of the territorial public works
department and Secretary A. P. Tay
lor of tbe Hawaiian Promotion Com
mittee the proiKtsed Hawaiian village
which the Promotion Commitee has
for some time hoped to have estab
lished somewhere within the city of
Honolulu was discussed, resulting in
Superintendent Forbes suggesting the
beach along the Ala Moana road as an
appropriate location, and expressing
his desire to cooperate with thePro
motion Committee, city planning com
mission, and other organizations
toward the. accomplishment of this
object ;:.;:'.. -:..-V; -V; ' -. A:
The Hawaii Promotion Committee
some time ago tentatively" suggested
the - Island back of Makee island at
i Kaplolanl Park, as an appropriate loci:
tion for such a village, because of the
site being surrounded by water, and
access could be made by ono. bridge,
which would give more or less control
by the park authorities over, the vil
lage activities.-'1 "-"V'. "1' '; ' ' '
1 The village idea contemplated the
combination of old style grass houses,
with a f elected population which could
combine, with the sentimental feat
ures, the utilitarian ones of making
mats and other well-known Hawaiian
curios for 6ale, thereby assisting the
movement in a practical manner. -
Superintendent Forbes this morning
informed the promotion secretary that
he had in contemplation many lnv
provements that could be made along
the Ala Moana 6trip, such as building
a roadway with coral dredgings from
the ocean, lining the roadway on both
sides with coconut palms and improv
ing the section generally, and remov
ing the dump plies, which have been
growing for many years.
The village, he suggested, could be
located on the beach, and grass houses
properly constructed for the Inmates,
surrounded possibly by a wall of foli
age and made picturesque by the
planting of many trees, including a
grove of coconuts- During the
dredging operations for road material
the , present narrow channel into the
bay could be deepened and widened,
and a short pier constructed for the
use of outrigger canoes and fisher
men's boats, thereby giving opportun
ity for small pleasure craft to come up
to the village from the water route
from Honolulu harbor and from
Walkiki. v
In addition to the sentimental at
traction of the village, the utilitarian
side is quite' manifest in the oppor
tunities the villagers would have for
fishing and getting shell fish, seaweed,
etc. The surroundings would be more
or less natural to the selected popula
tion of villagers.
Superintendent Forbes has shown a
very deep interest in heiaus and their
restoration, so that the modern popu
lation end sightseeing crowds could
have an opportunity of studying these
unique places of worship of ancient
times. : He suggests that a small
model heiau be erected near, the vil
lage, thereby giving tourists an oppor
tunity of seeing at f rst hand a type of
