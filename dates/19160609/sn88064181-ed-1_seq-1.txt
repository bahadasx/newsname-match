We purchased two solid cars this season, which guar
antees you just the kind and size wanted, and a price lower
than you could possibly obtain elsewhere. This large
purchase enables us to maintain the same prices we have
made for the past four years, notwithstanding the fact,
that all the factories have advanced their prices over 25
per cent.
This is one of the many advan
tages of buying from us.
A solid car of chain and lawn swings just
received. Our No. 1 swing is made of solid oak,
full bolt construction, has best quality souldered
linc! galvaaized chains, very heavy hooks, and is
nicely finished the new brown Fumed finish.

T'le cup presented was one of '

Immediately after the pre

the meeting was adjourned to
the Sheriff's home at Riverton i
wh.er :refreshments were servedl
'and the good health, happiness

WHAT GOT HER OUTt
SIE LICKED THE BRICK, OF COURSE.
I have handled Blackman's Medicated
Salt Brick for over a year and find it gives
entire satisfaction. I think it is a sure
remedy for stock when wormy and in a
weak and rundown condition. It loosens
the hide. stimulates and gives an appe
tite. In fact it does all you claim for it.

Two Most Interest
ing Lectures Sunday:
The Life and Habits of thQ
Acadians Told of by
Lecturer

tive lectnres were delivered here

r The speaker took for his sub
ject the work in South Louisiana
where sLill dwells the Acadian
farmers in the land of Evange
line; where Protestant cnurches
are not, and where many have
never the gospel expounded by
any save the Roman Catholic
Spriests; where the simple tra
ditions and varied superstitions
brought from far-away Nova
Sc ,tia a:e as real as ever among
the simplle, u!leawned but kind,
gentle and generous Acadian
people.
The speaker was well versed i
up,,n his subject, has spent a
long time among the Acadians, '
knows them and their peculiari- I
ties, and knew how to tell of
them, which made his lecture of 
more than passing interest, an '
to those of his auditors wh i
ha eJ& eled o*l " tho
Lafourche, Teche, Terrebone,
Etc., his talk brought back I
thoaghts of pleasant days spent
among the Acadian people.
