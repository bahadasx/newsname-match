inentrout had them at his mercy
at practically every stage of the
game and had he received proper
support the score would have
been much different. The locals
touched Collins up for eleven hits,
Smith and Armentrout featuring
in the hitting.
The game, while not devoid
of errors, was most exciting from
start to finish not only to those
who brought back Ollie money
with them, but to everyone who
witnessed it.
This is the first game won by
the locals this season but it ap
pears that they have just got their
stride and from now on we ex
pect to chronicle a victory for
them at least once a week, begin

expect to even up with Glendive,

Child Excites Neighborhood by
Wandering!Four Miles From
Home. Found at Sen
tinel Butte.
The family and friends were
greatly excited Tuesday after
noon over the disappearance of
the little 4-year-old daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. D. C. Young, re
siding about five miles south of
Beach. The little one strayed
away from home at about five o'
clock Tueday, and was not miss
ed until some time afterward,
when the frantic parents, aided by
sympathetic neighbors, started a
thorough search throughout the
neighborhood. Sheriff S. A.
Smith was notified and with his
deputies aided in the search. The
little tot was finally found at
Sentinel Butte, none the worse
Cor Ihe experience. As Sentinel
Hulte is about four miles from the
Young home, considerable myst
ery attaches as to how she was
able to make the distance alone
and unassisted.
Contractors Salzman & Wein

tion work on J. R. Waters new
residence in this city. The new
home will he among the most
handsome in the city, and will be

pected that it will be ready for oc
cupancy in a fe\v weeks.
