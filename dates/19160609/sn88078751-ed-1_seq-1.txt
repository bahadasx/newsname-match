HARDING'S KEYNOTE
Striking Phrases From the Temporary
Chairman's Speech.
Chicago, June S. Senator Warren
G. Harding of Ohio, temporary chair
man of the Republican national con
vention, made a line impression as he
delivered the keynote speech.
Declarations for "true American
ism," for adequate defense, for a pro
tective tariff and for a stronger for
eign policy which would protect a cit
izen of the United States wherever
he went, were the salient features of
Mr. Harding's address. He accused
the Demociatlc administration of in
sincere and inadequate preparedness
measures, of vacillation and weak
ness In handling foreign affairs and
of a tariff and taxation policy which
would have meant disaster had not
the great war brought prosperity in
spite of the situation, and which will
ruin the country when the feverish
tfar boom passes.
In beginning his speech he held out
tho olive branch to the Progressives.
, Ho asked the Republican party to for
get 1912. "We did not divide over
fundamental principles, we did not
disagree over a national policy," ho
said. "We split over methods of par
ty procedure and preferred personali
ties." A few moments later in his speech
he added: "And the welcome dele
gate who emphasizes his progressiva
Ism is expected to do his part in mak
ing our party a reflex of the best
best thought and best intent of sin
cere committal to the uplift and prog
ress of the American people, thereby
strengthening party purposes instead
of magnifying individual belief, and
he, too, will And new rejoicing in be
ing a Republican. No party can en
dure which Is not progressive."
After criticising Democratic plans
for building up the army and navy he
said that armed defense must ever be
linked with industrial self-reliance,
and industrial preparedness is a
prime necpsslty. He dwelt for some
time on the tariff question, which he
said had helped to make Germany
great and was probably about to be
adopted by Great Britain. "For my
self, I prefer a protective and produc
tive tariff which prospers America
first," he declared, and added: "Pres
ent prosperity is only the gold sluiced
from tho river of blood poured out by
the horrifying sacrifice of millions o!
our fellow-men," and permanent pros
perity could only be based on & sound
tariff law.
Republicans would like to see jus
tice to all the world, Mr. Harding
stated, and to have every nation bring
its standard of living up to the high
est In the world, which is the Ameri
can. But to bring this about, he con
tinued, the United States did not In
tend to try reducing American stand
ards until conditions were equal to
those abroad. He condemned the pro
posal to give up the Philippines. He
also declared the part of the United
States must be trusted leadership in
a fraternity of American republics.
He praised the immigrant and said a
few zealots of any origin who vio
lated our neutrality can not impugn
tho loyalty of the mass
