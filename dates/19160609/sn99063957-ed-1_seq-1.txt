By Fred S. Ferguson.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Chicago, June P. (4 p. m.T Tn
:n orgy of speech mak in g, cheering and
.shouting, the republican national con
tention named its favorite and favored
ems in nomination for the presidency
today, whir tho affairs of the G. 0. P.
'owly lint surely approached a crisis.
"Within few lionra the country may
luiow whether the republicans will pre
sent a united front, or again go to the
polls with rnnks divided and with n
third candidate in the field, the nomi
nee of the progressives.
At the Auditorium, the progressives
virtually marked time, held firmly in
check by tho conservative faction. The
radicals apparently had been effective
ly steam rollcred and rolled and the
nomination of Theodore Roosevelt was
not to be permitted until the last hopo
or rejoining of the progressive and re
publican forces had vanished. Iu the
ineantinfe, the republican machine
ground on steadily toward tho moment
when the final decision must come.
May Ballot at 5:30.
It was estimated at 4 o'clock that
at the rate the nominating speeches
and demonstrations were being; disposed
of. the first ballot 'for president might
be reached by 5:.10. No recess was plan
ned. ,
Some believed adjournment for a
time might be taken after about two
ballots to permit further conferences
between the "peace committees" but
the opinion wns general and it was ap
parently the plan of the leaders that n
nomination should be made before final
Adjournment tonight. It was a great
day for the favorite sons. At the eon
elusion of each nominating speech their
state delegations led in a session of
cheering and parading. At this hour,
Theodore Burton had the best of it, so
far as a record for sustained noise nink
ii'P was concerned.
Burton's demonstration sagged badly
at the knees at times but it was kept
alive for .14 minutes. The Fairbanks
demonstration lasted ?,3 miuutes. The
demonstration 'for Lawrence Y. Slier

minutes nnd that for Justice Hughes 20,

HITCHCOCK SAYS HUGHES
GETS IT ON THIRD BALLOT
Smoot Says Two Ballots Will

By Prry Arnold.
(United Press stuff correspondent)
Chicago, June 9. I'nless the "pus
syfootera" among the progressives cau
do the superhuman and hold their "di
rect action" advocates in line, Theo
dore Roosevelt will today Do nominated
for the presidency by the bull moose
and the republican national convention
will take itH pick of Hughes, Burtou,
Fairbanks, Root and a dozeu others.
The harmony conference committee
was to report its deadlock today to
both conventions. The deadlock came
on tho proffer of Roosevelt's name as
the only choice of the progressives for
president. Committees from both par
ties agreed in the necessity of putting
forth a strong candidate, both agreed
that, in essentials, there is no difference
between the two parties. But insistence
of the progressives that Koosevelt be
uamed, brought no responsive echo from
the other side.
Only superhuman efforts by the har
monyites has so far prevented the bull
moos delegates from naming Koose
velt. The prospect was when the direct ac
tion adherents learned nt 10 o'clock
from their committee that there was a
deadlock over Roosevelt, the harmony
ites would find it extremely difficult
to stave off n nomination nt once for
the colonel. Certainly his nomination
was assured if the bull mooaers learned
that the republicans were proceeding
with their nominations.
The favorite son? and tho Hughes
boomers in the republican meeting both
want an early test in the voting They
were expected to voice insistent de
mand for compliance with the original
convention program that of proceed
ing today on nominating speeches and
balloting.
Tho situation, therefore, resolved it
self into a test of the domination which
"bosses," both republican and pro
gressives, could exert on the rank and
file.
It's Up to Republicans.
It was up to the two conventions to
say whether the harmony committee
should continue its negotiationsand
neither convention was for temporiz
ing. In such a situation anything was
possible. The conferees from both par
ties met in perfect amity and there was
a ray of hope among the harmonyites
that both conventions might carry' this
same amity program but it was just a
slight hope. With tho Hughes forces
and those of the allies straining at the
leash, each fearful that prolongation of
tho climax of nominating would sap
their strength, the harmony workers
wore, admittedly facing a hard task.
Tho organization lenders were not re
vealing their hands. The republican
convention had nothing to do today but
to hear nominating speeches and to bal
lot. The progressives still hod their
platform on the table and iu a pinch it
was admitted that might be used as a
stop gap by Executive Chairman George
V. Perkins to hold off the nominating.
It is mainly up to tho republican
convention to say whether there shall
be a further session of the conference
committee. The republicans iu the
harmony conference did jiot. reject
Roosevelt's name they merely received
it, and held such a proffer would have
to be made direct to the (1. O. P. hosts.
If the convention wnnts further acgo
tintions, the committee is really to pro
ceed nlong the lines of whatever in
structions may bo given.
Says Hughes on Third Ballet.
Frank Hitchcock announced his con
viction that Hughes would be nominat
ed on the third ballot today. On the
first roll call he said, the delegations
would register their complimentary
votes but from then on there would be
big gains lor Hughes, with each cull tif
the states.
Ho smilingly refused to comment on
the probable effect of the compromise
committees Keport or to predict any
other outcome than Hughes selection.
"The conference will meet again,"
said Senator Borah, one of the confer
ees, "but not until after the conven
tions meet nnd then only if it is in ac
cordance with their wishes."
The way the inner G. O. T. circle
looked nt things today was that Roose
velt wns running to cover. They be
lieved lie would never coivsent to anoth
er fight on a third term. They believed
the business interests which have so far
come out in his favor would uot go

Hughes Must Win on Second
Ballot or Lose Say Sports
Will Try Out Favorite Sons
By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Chicago, June 9. Hughes must be
nominated on the second ballot, or lie
can't survive, according to the belief of
the favorite sons today. The first bal
lot would more or less perfunctory, the
allies claiming to hold the balance of
power, 57 votes. Hughes is expected
to get between 175 and 200 votes on
this ballot and then will come the real
fight. At the end of tho first bullot, a
hundred delegates will be released from
voting for their favorite sons.
Hughes' failure to land this strength
and the allies think this inevitable
the allies nre expected to try out sev
eral of their number preferably Sher
man, Fairbanks nnd Wwks. While man
agers of the Burton, Cummins and othet
favorite son campaigns decline to com
ment on the, possibility- of this, the
word went around nt nn early hour this
morning that Buch arrangemeub lad

The Burton crowd will try an early at
the second ballot to divert soma of the
relenscd delegntes to the Ohioan and
make a determined effort on the third
ballot nt lenst, for strong suppurt. Be
yond that, they claim no plans.

London, June 0. I.einberg, the great

the Russians drove the Austriaus back

Austrian Offensive Weakens.
London, June 9. Italian gains at sev

Chicse valley and the dispersal of the
Austrian concentrations iu the l.ndar
ina valley, are considered indicative of
the further weakoning of the Austrian
offensive dun to the withdrawn! of sol
diers to defend against the Russians.
Iu tho last several days the Austrian
official reports hnve not claimed gains
on the Italian front. Prior to June 4,
gains had been reported almost daily

Coliseum, Chicago, June 9. (1. O. P.
hasts today received report of tho har
mony conferences between republicans
nnd progressives without any great
amount of enthusiasm and promptly
went ahead to nominate their candi
dates for tho presidency.
Mention of Roosevelt's nnmo by Sen
ator Smoot in reading the report of the
conferees evoked only one and one-half
minutes of applause and it was uot any
too fulsome at that.
Call of the roll of states for nominat
ing speeches was begun at 11:47.
Alubama temporarily passed, Alaska
did not answer and Arizona finally
yielded to New York Governor Whit
man then put Justice Chnrles Evan
Hughen in nomination. An attempt to
have Colonel Roosevelt invited to ad
dress the republican convention proved
abortive Delegate Leon Weinberg, of
Maryland, has a resolution all reudy,
providing nn Invitation, but was fore
stalled when informed that unanimous
cousent was necessary for its considera
tion.
Smoot 's report wns considered with
deep attention, nnd ho frequently had
to pause for applause.
Chairman Harding volunteered tho in
formation thnt tho harmony committee
not having been discharged, would con
tinue its work".
Hughes Nominated.
The prospect at noon wns that the
nominating and seconding speeches
would continue for at least three hours.
Whitman nominating Hughes, said
"We are assembled here to name the
standard bearer of the great republican
party. We nro here in responso to a
demand.
"We ure here in response to the de
mands of the American people, thnt n
minority president give way to a lead
er, representing the will of tho major
ity. We arc here to select tho next
president of the United Statets.
"The national horizon is dark nnd
troubled. From afnr tho lurid flashes
of a world wnr remind us of our own
citizens killed nnd our own flug insult
ed. To the south, wo see anarchy en
croaching on our borders. At Wash
ington, the president watches and
waits.
"Yet, we must not think the task be
fore us an easy one. The country is
still nt pence, nnd the maintenance ot
peace will be plausibly claimed by the
democratic party. The party hopes 'hat
the country will soon forget, tho insults
to our national honor. It is its belief
that the people will not long remember
the vacillating diplomacy clothed in
glittering rhetoric which has alarmed
our people, discredited our standing
among the nations and brought us to
the verge of war.
New Form of Prosperity.
"A form of prosperity is in the land
nnd few, perhaps, realize its tempo
rary nature or pause to analyze its
cause."
Here Whitman cited the European
war as giving unnatural prosperity.
"If tho devout prayers of all man
kind be answered and our hopes be ful
filled, which (iod grant, the frightful
holocaust of war will end as quickly
and unexpectedly as it began, ni the
product of European labor will pour
In upon us, undeterred by a tariff bar
rier; at prices ruinous to our trade and
industries," he continued.
"We must choose a man so great that
he may meet lis a true American the
supreme nntl'innl issues, not only of the
hour, but of the future.
"Our party Is rich, in men imbued
with the true spirit of Americanist.
Not one of them can clnim preponder
ance of tho American spirit in his heart
or in his nature.
"We bring to yon today the name of
a man trained in battle for tho truth,
tried and found faithful in the adminis
tration of great public trusts, sterling
in bis republican ism, free from faction
al strife. His private life is above sus
picion, his public life without a flaw,
a great lawyer, nn effective enmpnigner,
nn able executive, a mature statesman,
a learned jurist, he, ubovo nil others,
combines tiie essential qualifications of
a true loader in this crisis of the party
and of the nation."

Chicago, June 9. The progressive na
