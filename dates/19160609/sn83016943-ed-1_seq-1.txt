Cow Testing Association
,aks for Larger Dairy Profits
. W. Merrill. TV Laval Department of Dairy
Development.
If I were to name the factors
iat are contributing to prr fitable
liry development I would say
hat the cow testing association is
he leading one. It is the one
factor that puts dairy production
upon a business basi3. It is the
one means by which a dairyman
may know whether he is in the
business for pleasure or for profit.
"Wherever cow testing associations
are formed, an element of per
manency is given to the dairy in
dustry; better systems of feeding
dairy cows prevail; better bred
ires are invariably purchased.
he men who are members and
receipe of these influences become
lottery1 farmers, better producers,
'better all round" citizens.
A cow testing association is
meroly an organization of men
who own and milk cows, organ
ized for the purpose of determin
ug profits and losses, and to de
rmine ways and means of irn
oving their industry.
The association generally re
ires a membership of twenty
e to thirty cow owners,
t he number of cows owned by
:h man is not so important, as
rules provide that the official
ter shall spend one day each
nth with each and every mem
, and he can test a large herd
well as a small one.
Tie business of the official
er is to keep an accurate ac
it of every cow listed in the
ciation. To secure this data
members are required to weigh
milk of each cow every day,
to take samples whenever re
ed. The tester then tests the
pie and determines the
unt of milk and butter-fat
uced, and the profit or loss of
: cow for the month Tie ad
js on the kind of food to be
I and regulates the amount ac
Ung to the manner in which
tow uses it.
JT SMALL COMPARKD WITH

cost of an assosiation can.
e compared with its value to
embers. Yet in round num
t amounts to from 2 to $3
cow peV year. Practical ly
ily cost is in the salary of
jester, and this is usually
low for the reason that
j men take hold of the work
;iy to gain experience,
lope the time is not far dis
when the importance of an
.al cow tester will be appreci
1 more, and that attractive
salaries will be paid and that
more efficient, better equipped
men will take hold of the work.
WHAT ONE WESTERN ASSOCIATION

probabl. be of interest and lend
encouragement to other communi
ties where an association might
be formed.
The Eichmond-Lewiston Utah
Cow testing Association was
formed in 1911. The first year
495 cows produced an average of
254 lbs. of butter-fat, which is 90
lbs. of butter-fat higher than the
average for the county.
There are two reasons lor this
high yield above the average.
As is always the case tne Dest
dairymen entered the association
and conseauently the best cows
'ere enrolled.
The second reason is that before
first vpiir was completed 100
; were found to be unprofit
and were discarded.
le average income per cow
SS3.80. The cost of feed was
51, giving a profit of ?45.29
mw. This one lesson must
ft heen a revelation to the
rvmen of Utah, for the aver
production of the cows in the
e is onlv 110 pounds per cow
the members soon discovered
,t forty-eight of the best cows
uld make as much money as
J of the poorer ones, or one
od cow would make as much
ney as four poor ones, yet it
sts as much to keep a poor cow
it does a good one.
They learned another valuable
-son, too, and one that is
laptable to all of the Western
country, namely, that "dairy
bred cows show a decided ten
dency toward a longer lactation
period than scrub cows."
You can tell a body of dairy
men that one benefit of dairy
breeding is that the time of giving
milk is lengthened and a conse
quent larger amount of milk and
butter fat, but too nnny of them
are "from Missouii." The test
association will convince the most
skeptical.
Eight here is the most convinc
ing argument for an association,
foi such an organization invari
ably leads to dairy breeding, the
selling of the scrub and the dual
purpose cow and the adoptiou of
a system ot breeding which leads
to piofit.
Very often the question is
asked, How long should a cow
rest between lactation periods?
This association proved conclu
sively that one month was not
long enough, but that nothing
was gained with a rest of two
months or more.
"Cows which freshened in the
fall produced on the average 45.1
lb. more fat and returned !t.43
more piofit above cost of feed dur
ing the next twelve months than
cows freshening in the spring.
The cost of feed was only ...s:5
more per head for the cows fresh
ening in the fall."
This one association taught this
truth, that if the same improve
ment made with one herd during
two years could be made with
all the cows in the state, it would
mean an annual increase of $1,
250.000 over the present value of
the state's butter-fat.
If all the cows of the state
could bo brought up to the stand
ard rd ,;on of the Kich
moiid-uewiston I'ow Testing Asso
ciation it would raise the value of
the state's butter fat $3,000,000.
This being true can anyone
explain why cow testing associa
tions are not formed all over the
state? And vet this is true of
everv state in the union where
daii h)H is practiced.
li auy of our big corporations
could see an opportunity to in
crease the profits of their busines
with as little cost to the business
as the cow testing association
nvolves, they would jump at the
opportunity.
The whole trouble lies in the
fact that we have not learned the
"business of dairying." We
theorize and speculate, advise
and exhort, preach and propound,
but we don t get down to bed
rock principles of efficient busi
ness management iu dairy production.
The cow testing association is
.1 Ti .'. . il...
paving me way. it is uiu crovs
road sign pointing to better
dairying.
An Interesting Decision
The supreme court has just ren
dered a decision which is of gen
eral importance. A girl went in
to the yard of a neighbor who
owned a vicious bull dog. The
dog attacked the girl and severely
tore her llesh. A suit for dam
ages was filed by the girl's mother,
and the jury awarded her 100.
Both sides appealed and the court
reversed the decision on the
ground that the sum was entirely
inadequate. In rendering the de
cision the court says:
"It .appears from the testimony
that this brindle bull dog had pre
viously bitten other people and
that his vicious and ferocious
character was well known to the
appellants and that he was kept
on the premises running loos.e,
with the full knowledge of appel
lants that he would attack per
sons who might come within the
yard. The verdict for .100 in
this case is grossly inadequate,
and evinces passion, prejudice or
a reckless disregard of the testi
mony, on the part of the jury.
Tort (iibsou Reveille.
Whence This Prosperity?
In ilu?h time-, such as uow pre
vail over mct of the United
States, if the Republicans happen
to lo in power they err to the
country: " e brought you pros
perity; why should you turn ns
out!" And the result has been
that the country heeded the. cry.
Xow that the Democrats are in
power the icepuoucans say mat
politics has nothing to do with
the present wave of prosperity,
and but for the war the whole
cauntry would be at a low level of
depression.
Xot only do the Republican
politicians say this, but the great
banking houses that reflect the
views of the "Wall Street influ
ences and are part and parcel of
the Privilege that controls the
Republican party say it. J. S. j
IJache & Co., New York, issue one
of the most widely read weekly
reviews coming out of New York.
Its Republican affiliations are
just as widely known. Hear
'Cache & Co. :
"Xo one who gave the mat
ter the briefest thought
would claim that the activity and
profit of the business movement
is due to anything but the war."
Mobilians recently heard Secre
tary Redfield say that the war
tax business, while immense, was
not a vital element iu the eight
thousand millions of foreign com
merce now being done by this
country, and that the great
bulk of that business was not
grain and raw products but the
complete manufactured article
which comes from the mills and
factories and shops that employ
the body of our voting population
and these voters arc uo,v being
paid higher wages than in years
past. There is no idleness in the
manufacturing towns, and the
prosperity the manufacturers en
joy is being spread and enjoyed
rail and water, by their employes
which number millions, by the
banks and merchants and finally
by the farmers.
If Republican policies can bring
prosperity so can Democratic
policies, and such pronounced
and unusual prosperity as we now
have must be credited to the
Democratic administration. The
country will laugh at any man
who tries to take the credit away.

Before the war Iceland was one of
poorest of countries, but during the
last two years its exports to England
of hides, fish and game have brought
in such unheard-of riches that the
bankers of Reykjavik are at their wits'
ends to know what to do wilh the
money. Iceland has no "great white
way," no "lobster palaces'" or any of
the other ordinary means of relieving a
foal of his money.

A Sinister Proceeding
The Clarion-Ledger would con
vince Governor Bilbo that his re
fusal to accept the Supreme
court decision against his ap
pointment of a factory inspector
is a flagrant violation of law.
But as explained by the Gov
ernor's attorney. Judge Robert
Mayes, it is not so bad as that.
Finality of the case awaits the
ruling of the court upon a sug
gestion of error he is preparing.
the sinister feature ot the case
as it stands is that the Mayes
motion will be presented to a
court a majority of whose mem
bers are Bilbo appointees.
Though this is a mere incident
on its face, and we trust in its
bearing on the said judges, it is
much more in the Bilbo philoso
phy of his appointing power.
While the bare suggestion of
such an ill-flavored considera
tion would have been a calumny
against governors of the old
regime, it is not with one who
rounds up his levee boards and
hospital et cet trustees, and
swears them to appoint to places
of trust and profit they control,
his political henchmen. He has
even laid profane and factional
hands pn the old soldiers' home.
The integrity of the court does
not weigh with such a chief ex
ecutive. In the course of castigating
Gov. Bilbo for his persistence
in trying to force Factory In
spector McDowell out of the
oihce he legally nils that it may
be passed over to another, the
