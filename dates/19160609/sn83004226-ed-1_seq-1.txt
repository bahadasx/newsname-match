an unusually large amount of develop

The week s operations were featured
by one strike of unusually larg. ca
pacity in th. Cow creek district, Es-

lease, within the proven area, yielded a
renuln. gusher, the first 24 hours' flow
registering 200 barrels. This Is per
haps the best strike yet made in that
county, where big wells have bees fea
turing the situation for several months.
The week's returns show the usual
number of falr-slxed producers In Es-till-cu,
six completions, all In the pro
ductive clans, being shown In addition
to th. 100-barrel strike. One comple

made 25 barrels each. Due to scarcity
of drilling material progress in advance
work has been somewhat slow. It Is

BEACH BARCIS
PAR0LEDFR0ia PRISON
YOUNG MAN WHO KILLED HI8
FATHER, THE FAMOUS FUED
LEADER. :''
:-v- -. v.
On Tuesday of this week the Board
of Prison Commissioner, paroled Beach
Hargis, who killed bis father. Judge
James Hargis, of Breathltt-co, in Feb
icaung uquor iu j -
ner.
Beach 1. now SO year. old. He is a
handsome, gentlemanly fellow, who
evidently suffers strong and constant
remorse for th. awful crime which B.
committed while under th. Influence of
whiskey and morphine. - Hia father,
generally cruel and violent, also was
under th. Influence of liquor and was
beating and choking th. young man at
the time k. fired th. fatal .hot. Th.
first trial resulted in a hung Jury, th.
final vol. standing t for acquittal and
t for conviction. About two years time
was spent In JalL During the second
trial Beach was out on bond and got
drunk and .hot off a pistol pro mi ecu
ously In th. town. The Jury gave him
a life sentence, doubtless being large
ly influenced by bis conduct at that
time. Thl. was In March, 110. His
mother ha never relaxed her efforts In
all that time to secure a pardon or pa
role, end her appeals have been hard
to resist. Beach Is her only son. She
argued that, unlike' other cases, his
crime bad brought no suffering to any
except his own family, and that to be
deprived of his presence and help only
doubled her heavy burden. Since last
November her health has been so bad
that she-was forced to discontinue her
trios to Frankfort. A few week, ago
she was taken to a hospital at Lexing
ton and is yet there In quite a feeble
condition. Sh. was overjoyed at the
new. which reached her by telephone
about Ave o'clock Tuesday evening.
Beach went to Lexington at 8:45 that
evening and went Immediately to the
hospital.
For four year. Beach was assigned
to duty In the hospital, where he be
came quit, proficient as a nurse and
assistant to th. physician. H. learned
re do manp minor surgical operations.
and in th. absence of th. physician
performed such operations as ampu
tating an Injured "finger, etc In the
drug room he had access to intoxicants,
but never tasted them.
After hia conviction on hi. second
trial be appealed, and Judge H. 8. Bar
ker, now president of Stat. University,
dissented from th. majority opinion of
th. Court of Appeals, which affirmed
the life sentence. Judge Barker In a
letter to th. Prison Board said h. did
not believe Beach Hargis had a fair
trial and still thinks so. At the bottom
of this letter Is a pencil notation sign
ed by former Appellate Judge J. S.
Nunn, who also sat in th. case, stat
ing that he agrees In the main with
what Judge Barker said. Letters also
are on file from Judges John'M. Las-
sing and E. C. O'Rear, who said they
recall that there were grave doubts in
the minds of some of the Judges as to
whether young Hargis received Justice,
and on. from Judge J. P. Hobson, who
wrote the opinion. Judge Hobson said
that drink apparently was at the bot
tom of Beach's offense and if the au
thorities thought he had conquered the
habit he would be in favor of giving
him a chance.
Attorney General James Breathitt,
who briefed the case on appeal for the
Commonwealth, recommenaea a conui
tionai pardon; but Gov. Willson. while
recognising mitigating circumstances,
did not feel Justified in extending clem
ency so soon after conviction.
Beach grew up In the worst possible
environment. He lived In the atmos
phere of assassination and murder from
the aire of 16 to 21. His father was a
born leader, but he turned his talents
in the wrong direction. He was a viol
ent, dangerous man and waa charged
with being the leader and instigator of
the terrible reign of lawlessness that
save Breathitt such a bad name. He
was Indicted for complicity In the as
sassinations. Beach associated with
the desperadoes, drank and gambled
with them, and always had a big pis
tol strapped on him. What chance
had he to escape the penitentiary 7
He now declares he Will devote his
efforts to caring for and comforting
his mother, thus making amends, as
far as possible, for his misdeeds.

county feud leader, will bo taken to the

tence fnllowlnr a conviction on a

preme Court of the United States.

Gruesome Feature Prepared for Trial
of Roy Jordan.
Portsmouth, O., June 6. The head of

near here by blowing the top of her
head off with a shot gun. The body of
the woman was exhumed to-day and
the head severed to be kept as evidence.

his first confession accused the father
of killing the woman and later made a
confession saying he himself had acci
dentally shot her. The trial will open
June 27. Time. Star.
