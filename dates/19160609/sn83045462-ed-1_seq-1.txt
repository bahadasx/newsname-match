er. All these favorite sons have
their lightning hods set up to receive |
the colonel's favor should the light- 1
ning strike their way. <
The Hughes men, as the day opens,
are absolutely confident that all aspects
of the situation are favorable
to the nomination of the justice on an '
early ballot either tonight or, after a i
recess, tomorrow. They insist that
nothing but the colonel's absolute refusal
to sanction Mr. Hughe's nomi
nation can atop it now. Apd they can- 1
not for the life of them see how the
colonel could Justify such action.
The Hughes supporters say that the
failure of the conference committee
to agree upon a Joint candidate leaves
the field open to but two men. Hughes
and Roosevelt. The nomination or the
colonel by regulars is admitted, even
by the progressives, to be out of the
q-sstlon.
Willing to Bisk Bolt.
They believe that a 'majority of the
Individuals of the progressive convention,
omitting the radical leadership,
would in the end at the polls support
Mr. Hughes. They have reached the
point where they are willing to face
the necessity, if forced upon them, of
writing off the books as a bad debt
the radical element of the progressives,
believing that in numbers it is negligible.
Such republican leaders as Senator
Smoot and W. Murray Crane are of
opinion that the part of wisdom is to
proceed along, after a complimentary
vote to the favorite sons, to nominate
Mr. Justice Hughes. Every favorite son
column of strength is permeated with
delegates ready to turn to Mr. Hughes
and some will not wait to be released,
but will swing on the second ballot.
This, then, is the situation, as the
convention meets this morning, subject,
of sourse. to modification of unforeseen
developments at Oyster Bay and a
declaration by the colonel.
Letters Stir Indignation.
Indignation is expressed this morning
by delegates who have received copies
of letters sent out H>y German-American
Alliance proteating against the
nomination of Roosevelt or Root. The
organization, it will be recalled, met In
Chicago last week for the purpose of
bringing pressure to bear on the convention.

The letter la signed by Ferd Walther
as chairman of the German-Americai
Alliance of Chicago, and by Dr. H. C
Serhardt, as chairman of the "political
committee" of that organization.
Expect T. B. to Decline.
Leaders among the regulars broughl
to their associates today the statement
that in their opinion it would be wel
to proceed with the selection of candidate
without reference to any acliot
which the bull moose convention maj
take during the day or threatened foi
a future occasion. They said the regu
lars should not be dismayed if the bul
moose convention should nominate Col
Roosevelt as a third-party candidate
for, in their opinion, the probabilitiei
are that the colonel would not accepi
the nomination.
They contended that if Mr. Hughei
were nominated the colonel ?would withhold
action upon a bull moose nominatior
of himself until Mr. Hughes should announce
his views upon questions dear t<
the heart of the colonel, and were convinced
that the colonel would find it possible
to support the nominee of the regular
convention.
Obsequies for Bull Moose.
The opinion of close observers among
the regular republicans who have beer
in constant touch with the progregsiv<
leaders is that the bull moose party o
1912 is dead. As a potent Influence ii
the politics of the country it has ceasec
to exist.
They claim that the machinery operat
ing this bull moose convention was rk
organized to bring Theodore Rooeevel
back into the republican party, and thej
believe that object will be accomplished
notwithstanding the confusion and doub
of the moment. The plans were laid las
January by Mr. Perkins and his asso
dates. and there is confidence in thel;
ultimate achievement.
Hughes Forecast Stands.
Senator Smoot, one of the member
of the joint peace conference and i
recognized leader of the regulars, wa
asked this morning: "Is there any rea
son to change the forecast of the nomi
nation of Mr. Justice Hughes?"
"There is not," he replied, emphati
cally.
His opinion Is shared by a numbs
of other regulars of national reputa
tion and of influence in the part;
councils.
In contravention of this view is th
attitude of the allies and favorite son
leaders, which this rqorning is mor
defiant than ever. They were in con
ference the greater part of the nigh
and now claim that Mr. Huerhes'
strength on the second ballot will b
150 ahort of majority. It la well knowi
however, that they are baaing that
hope, which lacks a foundation of confl
dence. upon expected eleventh-hour in

Successes Believed Important.
Special dispatches from Petrograd
express the belief that the Russian successes
against the_ Austrians are far
"all five Austrian~"armies are on the
official announcements.
The Daily Telegraph's correspondent
ventures the assertion on the authority
of a prominent Russsian expert that
"all five Austrian armies are on the
eve of a?general retreat, and that Lemberg
is in great strategic danger."
On the same authority it is asserted
that "a strategic breach 100 miles wide
has been blown in the Austrian front,
, involving the armies of Gen. Count von
Bothmer and Gen. von Boehm-Ermolli,
and part of that of Archduke Joseph
Ferdinand."
Great Weight of Artillery.
According to other dispatches the
Russian success is largely due to the
unprecedented use of artillery, surpass
ling in intensity any previous efforts on
either side on the eastern front. The
retreat of many Austrian trench detachments
was completely cut off by a
curtain of shrapnel through which it i
was impossible for any living thing to
pass, and the Austr.ians were thus compelled
to surrender en masse.

losses at 200,000.

John R. McLean, publisher of '
the Washington Post and Cin- '
cinnati Enquirer, died at his
home, Friendship, at 2:50 o'clock
this afternoon, after an illness of ;
two months';?; duration. His ]
physicians ascribed his death as :
due to a complication of diseases. ;
His son, Edward, B. McLean,
and the following doctors were i
at his bedside: Hyatt, Haire, Da !

Spencer, Owen and Hume. J
Native of Cincinnati.
Johu Roll McLean, one of the most
widely known newspaper publishers in
the country, personal friend of many i
rulers in Europe, whose railroad, min- >
ing and real estate interests make his J
wealth almost incalculable, was born <
in Cincinnati, September 17, 1848. 1
Since the early 70s he has been one
of the most conspicuous figures in the }
newspaper field in the United States.
Since 1885 he has been a resident of
Washington and has been identified
with finance, public utilities, politics
and philanthropy.
His beautiful country estate, Friendship,
has been one of the suburban
.beauty spots of the National Capital,
where every year a spectacular society
fete for charity has been conducted. c
The city home at 1500 I street is one of B
the finest in Washington. It is, in fact,
a shell of masonry built around a his- n
toric home, whose interior decorations p
are art treasures from all countries of J
the world. This home was, previous to ?
the death of Mrs. Mclean several years ?
ago, a center of great social activity. c
Mr. McLean was educated in the pub- ?
lie and private schools of Cincinnati,
at Harvard and in Germany, where he
became a good German scholar. By
later residence in France he also
. learned to speak French fluently. c

When Mr. Whitman quoted from an

declaring for "adequate provision for

was more applause. Apparently onehalf
