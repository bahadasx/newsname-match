Arizona Yields to New York and

Takes Convention Floor.
IS CHEERED 25 MINUTES
By PERRY ARNOLD.
.COLISEUM, CHICAGO, June
0. The Republican convention on
reassembling this morning re
ceived the report of the harmony
conferences between Republicans
and Progressives without any great
amount of enthusiasm and prompt
ly went ahead to nominate their
candidate for the Presidency.
Mention of Colonel Roosevelt's
name by Senator Smoot, in read
ing the report of the "olive
branch" committee, evoked only
one and onffchalf minutes of ap
plause, and it was not any too ful-
infl, wine ut mm. .
Shortly after the session opened
Arizona yielded to New York, and
Governor Whitman placed Justice
Hughes' name in nomination, the
first to be presented to the conven
tion. A Hughes demonstration follow,
ed, which lasted for twenty-five
minutes.
SEES TWO BALLOTS.
Senator Smont, before the convention
went Into session, said he thought two
ballots on tho Presidential nomination
would 1'iobably be taken today.
"And then wo win adjourn until to
morrow," ho added.
The Sonotor could not bo drawn
into any predictions on the result of
the voting.
It was learned that tho program of
tho Hutches forces Is to have Ala
bama, first State on the roll, tempo
rarily pass, and for Arizona to yield
to New York. Then Governor Whit
man will place the Justice In nomi
nation. "There will bo a nomination today,"
said Senator Crane.
The Republican committeemen In
the harmony conference last night
did not roject Roosevelt's name they
merely received it and held such a
proffer would hove to be made direct
to tho G. O. P. hosts. If tho con
vention wants further negotiations,
the committee Is ready to proceed
along: the lines of whatever Instruc
tions may be Riven.
"Tho conference will meet again,"
snld Senator Borah, "but not until
after tho conventions moet, and then
if it Is In accordanco with their
wishes."
At 11 o'clock, tho time set for tho
third day's session of the Republicans,
there was no prospect of an Immcdlato
meeting. At that tlmo the hall was
ncnrly full,, and a cessation of tho threo
days rain was rcnecieu in more cneer
ful demeanor of delegates and specta
tors. There was moro "pep" In the air
than at any tlmo slnco the convention
was first called to order.
Neither Chairman Harding nor any of
tho others of tho "b!g ones" In tho O. O.
P. gathering were present. The crowds
moved bock and forth In the aisles dis
cussing matters loudly.
Crane and Smoot Arrive.
Senators Crane and Smoot arrived at
11:08, and Immediately put their heads
together, talking earnestly.
It wbb noted that tho great sounding
brard had been moved forward to the
very front of tho little speaking plat
form, branching out In front of tho
big platform.
Workmen had been working on it all
night.
Harding started things going at 11:13.

CHICAGO. June ".-Senator Durton of
Ohio loomed up as the strongest "dark
horse" candidate for the Q. O. P. Presi
dential nomination In betting circles
hero today when Jim O'Lcary, Chicago's
lurmler layer, quoted tho Duckcye
State's favorite son's chances at 4 to 1,
Burton was quoted at to 1 yestorday.
"The Ohio delegation is strong for
Burton and the fact that Nick Long
worth, Teddy's son-in-law, is ono of the
delegates makes It look as If the two
pnitles might compromise on Burton."
Betting on the other candidates con
tinued tho same as yesterday, with
Roosevelt quoted at even money.

CHICAGO, June 9. "The first session
of the conforeneo committees did not

Thus declared ono of the Republican
members of the pence confcrcnco this

There was no talk of platforms. On

OLD GUARD LEADERS
AID FAVORITE SONS
IN PLAYING FOR TIME
Balloting Due to Begin This Afternoon and
Hitchcock and His Lieutenants Insist
No Adjournment Will Be Allowed Until
the Justice Is Nominated.
CHICAGO, June 9. Far from conceding the nam
ination of Hughes today, the allies are doing their utmost to
prevent it and to hold back a stampede to the Justice on an
early ballot.
On theother hand, the Hughes leaders were disposed to
force through his nomination once the balloting is begun.
They said this afternoon they wanted no adjournment after
the voting starts.
Frank Hitchcock announced his conviction that
Hughes would be nominated on the third ballot late today.
On the first roll call, he said, l.he delegations would register
their "favorite son" complimentary votes, but from then on
there would be big defections to the Hughes' banner with
each call of the States.
He smilingly refused to speculate on the effect of the,
compromise committee's report or to predict any other out
come than Hughes' selection.
VOTING DUE THIS AFTERNOC T.
After a long and wearisome and fulsome lot of nom
inating speeches, it is expected the Republicans will begin
balloting late this afternoon.
The allies will try to prevent more than two ballots and
to force an adjournment, according to their present plans, a'
partial test of strength is likely to develop.
Down at bottom the Old Guard bosses are responsible
in large measure for the trouble in effecting a settlement of
difficulties here. They don't want Hughes and don't want
Roosevelt.
What they are looking for is a man in the White House
whom they can control, or at least, will be in sympathy
with their views. McKinley of Illinois, Hemenway of In
diana, Barnes of New York, and Penrose of Pennsylvania,
and a coterie of old-time bosses along with them are con
stantly pow-wowing and conferring.
WANT OLD GUARD MAN.
They want to throw the nomination to Fairbanks or
Weeks or Root or some one who has always trained with
their crowd in politics.
How to stop Hughes has
siderations for days. They
to 2 o'clock this morning and gave it out tney naa enougn
votes surrounded to block Hughes' nomination.
They profess to control 587 votes, but the Hughes'
leaders deride their claims and say as before that when their
combination is tried out in the actual voting it will fall to
pieces.
The Progressive leaders, including Perkins, Johnson,
Oscar Straus, Van Valkenberg, and several others, conferred
this morning among themselves.
They talked with the Colonel over the long distance
phone. It was decided, with the approval of Roosevelt, not
to allow the Bull Moose convention to nominate today if it
could be avoided. It was fully recognized that it might be
found impossible to stem the tide.
Colonel Roosevelt passed the word along the line to
let the Republicans go ahead and show what they intended
to do.
"GIVE THEM LEEWAY," T. R. MANDATE.
"Give them all the rope they want," was the effect of
his mandate.
The leaders said they would try to prevent the Bull
Moose naming him before the Republicans had a chance to
act. They didn't know whether they could prevent it.
They were pleased with the conciliatory attitude of the
Republican conferees.
Bull Moose leaders were apprised that the idea of the
Republicans nominating Roosevelt was making some head
way in the Republican convention. They were advised a
Roosevelt demonstration would be attempted by pro-Roosevelt
Republicans. '
