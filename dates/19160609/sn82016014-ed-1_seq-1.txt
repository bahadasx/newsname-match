Coliseum. Chicago, .) unc 9. It
was announced this afternoon that"
Senator Fall of New Mexico will
place Ttieodorc Roosevelt in nomi
nation before the Republican con
vention. (BY PERRY AKNOI l.)
Coliseum, Chicago, June 9. G. O. P.
hosts this afternoon cheered the name
of Justice Hughes for twenty solid
nerve-wrecking minutes in tie first
real, old fashioned Republican con
vention outburst that has featured he
present meeting. It gave former Pres
ident Taft, its nominee of four years
ago, a generous five minutes of noise.
Tbe convention was a field of ora
tory. It received report of the har
mony conferences between Republi
cans and Progressives without any
great amount of enthusiasm and
promptly went ahead to nominate
their candidate for the presidency.
Mention of Colonel Roosevelt's name
by Senator Smoot, in reading the re
port of the "Olive branch" committee,
evoked only one and one-half minutes
of applause and it was not any too
fuilsome at that. Call of the roll of
states for nominating speeches was be
gun at 11:47.
Alabama temporarily passed. Alas
ka did not answer, and Arizona final
ly yielded to New York. Governor
Whitman then put Justice Charles
Evans Hughes in nomination. An at
tempt to have Roosevelt's hint thst
he would address the Republican con
vention if invited taken up proved
abortive. leltgate Leon Weinberg of

Smoot's report was considered to
deep attention. He read it with great
emphasis and frequently had to pause
for applause. But never did this ap

Whitman Nominates Hughes.
Whitman, nominating Hughes, said:
"W'e are assembled here to name
the standard bearer of the great Re
publican party. We are here in re
sponse to- a demand. We are here in
response to the demand of the Amer
ican people .that a. minority president
give way to a leader representing the
will of the majority. We are here to
select the next president of the United
States.
"The national horizon is dark and
troubled. From afar the lurid flashes
of a world war remind us of our own
citizens killed and our flag insulted.
To the south we -see anarchy en
croaching on our borders. At Wash
ington the president 'watches and
waits.' Yet 'we must not think the
task before us an easy one. The
country is still at peace and the main
tenance of peace will be plausibly
claimed by the Iemocratic party.
That party hopes that the country
will soon forget the insults to our na
tional honor. It is belief that the peo
ple will not long remember the va
cillating diplomacy clothed in glitter
ing rhetoric which has alarmed people,
discredited us among nations and
brought us to the verge of war.
Prosperity, But
"A form of prosperity is in the
land and few, perhaps, realize its tem
porary nature, or pause to analyze its
causes."
Here whitman cited the European
war as giving unnatural prosperity-
"If the devcut prayers, of all man
kind be answered and our hopes be
fulfilled, which God grant, the fright
ful holocaust of war will end as quickly
and unexpectedly as it began, arid the
products of European labor will pour
in upon us, undeterred by a tariff bar
rier, at prices ruinous to our trade
and industries," he continued. "We
must choose a man so great that he
may meet as a true American the
issues not only of the hour but those
of the future. Our party is rich in
men imbued with the true spirit of
Americanism. Not one of them can
claim preponderance of the American
spirit in his heart or in his nature.
"We bring to you today the name of
a man trained in battle for the truth.

THEY'RE MAD NOW
Progressive Radicals Wanted

ConservatiYes Facing a domi
nation Fight Today.
nL H. U KEXMCR.)
Chicago, June 9. The Progressive
convention convened at 10:26 a. m.
today facing a fight to nominate
Roosevelt immediately after the con
ference committee reported on its
peace move with the Republicans.
Conservative leaders, however, agreed
to force tbe platform before the con
vention today and hold the radicals to
this plan. The radicals, however, will
begin their fight to nominate immedi
ately upon receipt of news that ballot
ing has begun at the Republican con
vention. Before the convention opened som 5
of the radicals, mad as hornets, con
sidered the convention had not passed
tbe Rubicon, in failing to nominate
Colonel Roosevelt yesterday.
"There is no use now; it's only a
dicker." one of them said.
At the same time, it was reported
many of the delegates had been won
over to Hughes and would accept him
i if Colonel Roosevelt endorses the
! justice.
Others insisted the Republicans
! must at least recognize a Progressive,
; perhaps Governor Hiram Johnson of
, California, with the vice presidency,
j Johnson, it was reported, would not
i accept any Republican honors.

BOTH HUGHES AND T. R. OUT?
Wagers in Chicago That Neith

And Then, Conventions May Go
Ahead Independently.
Chicago, Jun 9- Leaders of both
parties sat up most of the night dis
cussing numerous possibilities that
might develop and making plans to
handle some sudden enterprise should
efforts be made to stampede either
convention for a particular candidate,
or against further delay in making
nominations.
Many of the Progressives hoped
that Col. Roosevelt at Oyster Bay
would send a message to the harmony
conferees or to the Progressive con
vention that would have a bearing on
the situation.
The men advocating the nomina
tion by the Republican convention of
Justice Charles E. Hughes, of the
supreme court, declared this morn
ing that nothing had occurred to
weaken their positions; stated that
they believed their candidate can be
nominated today and prepared to
press for action on a nomination with
out delay.
roworite Sons Happy.
Managers for the various "favor
ite son" candidates insisted the har
mony conference program had greatly
improved the chances for their men.
Some wagers were made early to
day that neither the name of Hughes
or Roosevelt would appear upon the
Republican ticket, that a third man
would head it.
But in the absence of any definite
report of what happened at the
peace conference at the Chicago
club many people were sanguine of
definite results.
A majority of them seemed to think
that the conventions would go ahead,
regardless of each other, make their
nominations and adjourn.

carried into court April 24, when sen
tence was imposed, made a plea for
mercy from his cot. The prisoners
have been in the state penitentiary at
Santa Fe for safe keeping.

Thaumont Farm.
Paris, June 9. 11:45 a. m. The
Germans have launched a general at
tack along the entire front on the
right bank of the Meuse and have
penetrated the French line at one
point but were repulsed elsewhere
with heavy losses, according to an of
ficial statement issued by the war of
fice today.
The point where the Germans en
tered the French lines is in the neigh
borhood of Thiaumont farm. The
Germans also made two small attacks
southwest of Hill 304, but these at
tacks, the statment says, were re
pulsed. Admit German Advance.
Paris, June 9. Admission that the
Germans in their attacks of late yes
terday penetrated a French trench in
Caillette wods, on the east bank of
the Meuse, is made in the official
communique of the French war office
today. Elsewhere attacks were re
pulsed. The Germans are continuing their
attacks on a two kilometer front east
and west of Thiaumont farm, says the
statement, which characterizes them
as being of the utmost violence. On
the west bank of the Meuse two small
attacks on Hill 304 were repulsed. At
all points the German losses were
heavy.
Shift Attack to West Bank.
London, June 9. With Fort Vaux,
"key to Verdun" in their hands, the
Germans have shifted their heavy
artillery attacks to the west bank of
the Meuse and late yesterday bom
barded Hill 304 and the region of
Chattancourt with violence, Paris dis
patches announce. Chattancourt is a
point on the Chattancourt -Cliarny
Ridge, and is just south of Cumieres.
The French defenses on the east
bank of the Meuse have not been neg
lected by the Germans. They are car
rying on intermittent artillery attacks
with occasionally infantry rushes on
the positions near Thiaumont farm.
They were unable to gain ground.

Petrograd now claims 50,000 Aus

casualties of the present offensive, five
dare old, at nearly 200,000.
The greatest gain for the Russians
is Ltutzck, the third corner of the Vol
hynian triangle of fortresses. At this
point the Russians drove the Austrians
back twenty-five miles without halt

London, June 9. Italian gains
made at several points northwest of
Trent, in the Chiese valley, and the
dispersal of the Austrian concentra
tions in the La Garina valley are con
sidered indicative of the further weak
ening of the Austrian, offensive due to
the withdrawal of soldiers to defend
against the Russians. In the last sev
eral days, the Austrian official re
ports have not claimed gains on the
Italian front. Prior to June 4, gains
had been reported almost daily for a
period of two weeks. i
