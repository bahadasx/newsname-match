SECURES
Wednesday evening, June 7, ) 916, was
an eventful period for 20 of the bovs
and girls of tht? urauimar department of
the Paw Paw schools. The clans tbis
year was evenly divided, ten boys and
ten girls, and as tbey were grouped upon
the elevated platform the sight of the
young and happy faces well might cause
thtvheart of any food parent to throb
with pride and joy.
The exercises this year were held in
the high school room, which was made
to look ver cheery and homelike with
decorations of bunting, ferns and many
tiowtrs. Every recitation, eveiy dia
logue, every piece of music and every
drill was executed with much credit to
the ones taking part. Never before has
ae nicer and better looking class of oung
men and ladies entered tbe high school,
and we are eure that if these boys and
girls enter the higher grades with the
determination to persevere and tight for
the finish that the commencement class
of 11)20 will be one that any school may
well feel proud.
X. J. Cavauaugb, in behalf of the
school board, presented the clas vwth
their diplomas. His remarks v ere such
as to inspire and urge thetu on to great
er and higher attainments. John Lyle,

Crowd largest ever.
Saturday was Field Day for Van Huren
County High Schools, and 10 schools of
the county participated in the events.
As early as eight o'clock, automobile
loads began to arrive and at nine o'clock
the streets were thronged with school
children representing every part of the
county.
The rural eighth yrnde exercises wre
held at the High Sctiool Assembly rooms
where over 500 received their credentials
to enter high schools The address was
given by Rev. fr A. Shape of the Chris
tian church. Space will not permit even
giving a s nopsis of this lecture, which
was tilled with good advice to the young
bos and girls, and if given heed, will
prove ft rule soil for better manhood and
womanhood, better scholar and citizen
ship. His remarks were of an under
standing nature, and the child mind
could grasp every idea advanced by the
speaker.
The Paw Paw High School 13 tnd met
the morning train from the west, and
another large delegation arrived to par
ticipnte iu th festivities of the day.
The headquarters of the athletes were
at the Firemen's rooms, the hotels not
caring to accommodate theiu. Surely
the Pa- Pa i tire department should be
commended for their generosity in throw
ing open their rooms to the tfftOCiatioo .
No better place in the city could have
been offered the athlete, the large and

a meet and more gentlemanly set of boys.
There were estimated 5,000 people in
Paw I'aw and over 1,000 autos. The
council had provided special officers to
handle the truffle, and only forone slight
accident on Main and Kalambzoo street,
which whh entirely the fault of the party
receiving the damage, the large crowd
came and v.ent without any one seriously
injured. At six o'clock, Main street was
a solid mass of Mitos, and the manner in
which Mark C buffet handled the traffic
was commendable.
No town in the county could have
handled the crowd better than was hand
led here last Saturda. Not even De
catur, whose Superintendent seemed to
think that his town was the only one to
take part in the exercise, and who had
a lot of "air" to explode at the meeting
of the director. He eemed to have it
"in'' for Paw Haw and took every oppor
tunity to express himself against the
0 pitft I City fortunately all of his pet
schemes were met with opposition from
tbe more level-headed members of the
board.
The events were pulled otT as sched
ule d on the official program. The morn
ing sports were held on Kalamazoo street,
which was in perfect condition for the
running r iCfti The afternoon sports
were held on tbe bail rounds, and over
2,000 people paid admission. The re
ceipts of tbe a-Hociation were $501.00,
which was 152.00 more than was taken
at Decatur last year.

and Destroy Bridges.
Two Mills With
out Power
Wednesday night between the
hours of U o,clock and midnight
the upper dam in Lanphear's
pond gave way. The cement
wings and curbing crushing like
sand. The water all came into
tihe little pond which is held by
the Strong dam.
STRONG DAM BREAKS
The large body of water was
too much for the dykes, and about
40 foot of earth along the south
side of the cement dam washed
away. This let the water from
Lanphaar and Stroug pond into
the resevoir of the Free, Hall &
Mutchler.
FREE HALL & MUTCHLER'S

TOWNSHIP BRIDGE WASHED
AWAY
The big luidge whicti spans the river
proper on Kalamazoo street is eomp.ett -lygone.
The force of the water going
through the tunnel was too great, and
it forced its way under the tunnel and
the heavy sand on top forced the arch
to break, thus letting all the sand go
with the water. About 00 foot of the
bridge is all washed away, the break
Tim ";')! came on the north west corner and it
I will require several hundred loads of
sand to till, and it will require several
weeks before the bridge is used for traf
fic. Water stood about two foot above the
road and for the fact that the street be
ing built of roded stone the dm., gt
would have beeo much greater.
Traffic was stopped for neariy all day
Thursday.

BEEBE GIVES WARNLNG
D. A. Beebe, the night man at the
Water Works, had lust finished pump
ing and heard a roaring noise, stepptd
to the door and saw the large Volume of
water comma through the culvert of the
bridge, he goes to the street and grasps
the situation at once, returns to the
plant and calls the city electrician, Geo.
Whitehead, who goes to the power plant
north of town. At 12:20 the water at
the plant was about four inches from
high, two gates were lowered and th
small wheel pit opeoed, and the water
was held at tbe big dam below high
water mark.
The breaking of the three dams caused
a lass of several thousand dollars and
was the worst in the history of the water
powers of Paw Paw. The sight was
viewed by hundreds of our townspeople
early Thursday morning.

His discourse was a masterly one and
greatly enjoyed. The music was fur
nished by a male quartet composed of
of Messrs. Jennings, Mosier, Spicer and
