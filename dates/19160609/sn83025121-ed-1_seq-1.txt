AL'DITOBIUM, Chicago, June .
Strfclnipg against the bonds im
posed by the conservative ele
ment of the Progressive party, the
radical element At the national con
vention yesterday kept things in a con
tinual uproar, in which it was imposi
ble to be heard. That the amount of
work done by the convention aa a whole
waa large and satisfactory, is due to the
well organised committee system.
One wild scene followed another in
the big convention hall almost from tho
moment of opening, at two-forty two
o'clock in the afternoon. The election
of Baymond Boblns, the Chicago ora
tor, as permanent chairman of the con
vention started a storm of cheering aud
yelling that fell little short of the dem
onstration that greeted his mention of
Colonel j Buosn velt 'i name on the (1 rt
day. 7
Tho convention alao grew vociferoun
over the motion made by James K.

licans in an effort to obtain hurmo
nious working understanding. In an

Murdock got the cheers of th crowd
unin when he said that if the Pro

"It will be a hard job to prevent

Another 'Small Riot' Start -
Htill another small riot started when
despatches from Oyster Bay were read,
idicuting that Colonel Roosevelt might
come to Chicago and address the Re
publican ionyention. The despatches
were in answer to a telegram sent the
former President night before last" by
former Henator Jackson of .Maryland

of that state, usking Roosevelt to
ciiiiie to Chicago in the interest of
harmony and of the eonntryj
In reply v Colonel Roosevelt tele-
graphed: "Iiwlll come if the Republi
can convention desires me to address
it."
He added that he hopes the Republi
cans and Progressives might nominate
h man who, if elected, "would place
the nation where it belongs by muk-
; i ii y: it true fa itself, and therefore true
to ull mankind."
He said that Wilson "had rendered
! to the people the most evil service
that ran be rendered to a great demo
cracy," and declared "the differences
that divide not merely Republicans
mill Progressives but good Americans
of nil shades of political belief sink
into nothing when compared with the
issues now domanding decision unified
Americanism and a preparedness in the
fine of a world cataclysm, while tho
nation stands supine and belploss."

COL1KKPM, CHICAQO, June 9.
Swayed back and forth by the
opposing elements' ia the party,
and larking real leadership, the Repub
lican National convention Continued
yesterday to carry water upon both
shoulders, meeting the Progressive de- .
mnnds for a "liberal" platform and
one which Bounded a prcpsredneas and
Americanism note, but balking stead
fastly against the pressure to nomin
ate Theodore Roosevelt.
Karly in the session, Senator Hard- '
ing of Ohio, the chairman, after de
claring that "we are -ready and glad
to consult with the Progressive party
leaders, for we stand , for peace and
harmony," appointed a committee, the
complexion of which is anti-Roosevelt,
to confer with a committee picked from
among the moat stalwart supports of
the colonel in the Progressive ranks.
The Republican conference commit
tee, as named by the chairman, is com
posed of Senators Borah and Bmoot,
former Senator Crane of Massachusetts,
Nicholas Murray Butler of. Mew York
and B. A. Johnson, and shortly after
the committee was appointed the con
vention took a recess until eleven .
o'clock this morning.
Delegates Are Indifferent
la spite of this official action of the
convention there appeared to be a feel
ing of indifference, if not hopelessness,
among the delegates. . The convention
accepted the invitation for a confer
ence in an effort to secure harmony, ex
tended by the Progressives, almost in
silence, and certainly without any
demonstration, although there were but
few negative votes when the question
was put.
Progressive and Republican leaders
last night, after the conference had
started, admitted that the complexion
of the Republican body indicated that
It would not accept Roosevelt as the
candidate of the party, but in order to
secure harmony would not insist upon
the nomination of Hughes.' Indeed the
whole effect of the conference appar
ently is to throw the question of the
nomination into even greater uncer
tainty, which will remain until the
linul report of the committee. There
is even doubt that the report will be
accepted aud acted upon by the con
vention. Chief among the features that inter
ested the delegates yesterday waa the
drafting of the Bepublieaa - party's
platform and the fight oa many of tho
most Important planks.
