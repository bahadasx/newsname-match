CLOVIS ENTERTAINED HUN
DREDS AT BANKERS MEETING
Tuesday and Wednesday Were Gala Days in Clovis
When the Panhandle Bankers Convention Con
vened Here. About 150 Members of the As
sociation and a Thousand Visitors Were in At
tendance. Childress Next Meeting Place.
The Panhandle Bankers Con
vent ion has come and (rone, but
the memory of it will remain in
the minds of Clovis people for
tome time. It was a complete
success in every detail from
start to finish and nothing oc
cured to mar the pleasure of the
event. Tuesday and Wednesday
were red letter days in Clovis.
About 150 members of the as
sociation were presant and in
addition many hundreds of visit
ors who took advantage of the
low rates and who came to at
tend the carnival of fun and the
big barbecue.
Incoming delegates were met
at the trains by the reception
committees and the two Clovis
bands and escorted to the
Antlers hotel, which was made
the headquarters of the associ
ation while here.
THE CONVENTION, FIRST DAY
The convention was called to
order Tuesday morning at ten
o'clock by President Quigley, of
Memphis, at the Lyceum where,
all the meetings were r eld and
where the program was carried
through as per schedule. All
those on the program responded
in person except C. W. Harrison,
of Farwell. who was unable to
be present but who sent his
paper, which was read. Al
though not on the program the
key note speech of the meeting
was made by J. W. Hoopes Vice
Governor and a member of the
Federal Reserve board, who re
sides at Dallas. His talk was in
regard to the banking conditions
throughout the southwest and
the country in general and the
benefits derived through the
federal reserve system.
THE BIG BARUECL'E
The Clovis people undertook
to entertain on a big scale and
those who attended the barbecue
at Shipley Brothers ranch six
teen miles northwest of Ckvis
will testify that they succeeded
in doing it. At about two o'clock
a caravan of two hundred and
tit teen cars carrying approxi
mately 1200 to 1500 people left
for the ranch. It made a pro
cession five milts long with but
little space between the cars and
wa an inspiring sight. At the
ranch the party was entertained
by the girls band and many
toi k advantage of the opportun
ity to view the fine thoroughbred
stock. Calves were branded in
old cowboy fashion for the en
tertainment of the visitors and
bronco busting in wild west
style was of interest to many
Four Dig fat beeves had been
barbecued ia a first class manner
and there was plenty of choice
barbecued meat for everybody.
The open air ride had "whetted"
up their appetites and they ap
peared fully prepared for the
occasion. After a pleasant af
ternoon at the ranch the party
returned to the city about six
o'clock and at nine o'clock a
dance and reoeption was given
at the Elks Aunitorium. .

V. Pres., Pampa Texas. VV. O.
Oldham, V. President. Portales
New Mexico. F. E. Chamber
lain, Treasurer, Clarendon
Texas. R. A. Underwood, Sec
retary, Plainview Texas.

a New Mexico man has been
honored with an office in the

CHILDRESS GETS CONVENTION
In a fitting manner, W. H
Fuqua, president of the First
National Bank of Amarillo, pre
sented the claims of Childress
Texas as the next meeting place
for the convention. It was
chosen unanimously.
BANQUET
The entertainment was com
pleted Wednesday evening at 7
o'clock with a banquet at the
Gran Quivira which was largely
attended. During the two days
and remaining the balane of the
week are the Van Sickle Carol
val shows, which are rated as
among the best of the kind in
the country.
THE BANDS
Special mention is due the two
Clovis bands for the help they
gave during the entertainment
and without them it would have
been a "quiet" affair. The
ladies band have already been
engaged to travel in a special
coach to the Childress meeting
next year. Clovis people are
proud of their two excellent
bands.
Not An Issue
There is positively no sane
reason for bringing up the pro
hibition question in this cam
paign. That matter has been
fought out in a bitter struggle
and settled. It made enemies
of people that were once friends,
it divided churches, lodges, so
cieties and even families, so why
keep it revived? The sooner it
is forgotten, the better,, but Oh,
no! Some newspapers and poli
ticians think it is a winning card
and keep playing it at every
election and affair that comes up.
It is being used by some office
seekers in this election as their
chief qualification for office.
Without it they probably realize
that they could not hope to win.
Possibly they should not be
censured for this, but the News
believed the people are onto the
game and are not going to vote
for a candidate simply because
he haa no other qualifications
than that he was a "pro" or
"and."
Walkers Window
One of the most inviting and
attention getting show windows
ever displayed in Clovis was that
of the Walkers Meat Market,
which has arranged a mill wheel
turning round, while in the pond
below were ducks, fish, frog3
and turtles swimming in the
water. In the center of the
window stood a large cactus of
the stag horn variety while
ferns and lilies were profusely
displayed. Above was a cage
containing a red squirrel which
appeared to be contented in his
unusual surroundings. For
originality, Walker takes the
premium.
C. Shorett, who formerly con
ducted the Sanitary barber shop
is up from Artesia.

Pecos Valley Medical
Association Meeting
One of the most interesting,
as well as instructive meetings,
in the history of the Pecos
Valley Medical Association was
held here Tuesday. Seventeen
members from all parts of the
valley responded to roll call.
Luncheon was had at the Harvey
house At 12:30 and in the even
ing the members and visitors
attended the barbecue at the
Shipley Brothers ranch, The
meeting was in session the
greater portion of the day and
extended until late into the
evening, when some interesting
papers on clinical cases were
read.
The visitors included Doctors
Younger of Ardmore Oklahoma,
and Clark of Artesia.
Portales was selected as the
next meeting place and the
following officers -were elected
for the ensuing year:
President, Dr. Willard of Por
tales; V. president, Dr. Garmony
of Portales; Secretary, Dr. T. E.
Dunaway, of Portales.
Houk
Brothers
Deserve Credit
It is seldom that anything of
this nattiro is commented upon
by newspapers, but as it is a
matter of vital concern to the
public, it should have mention.
It is certainly commendable in
the Honks Brothers, proprietors
of the Star Market on West
Grand Avenue, when they re
fused to purchase meat that
they thought should not be sold
their customers. Many markets
would have taken it at the
tempting price. Houk Brothers
turned it down and the officers
can tell you the rest. In ad
dition we have noted that all
their butcher stock is of the very
best in the country and that
they understand their business
Courtesy and accomodation is
their motto and with such
principles they are winning a
large and ever increasing trade.

GREATEST NAVAL BATTLE
FOUGHT IN ALL HISTORY
England and Germany Eng aged in Greatest Conflict
on Seas in History of Naval Engagements with
Losses of Many Ships and Thousands of Men.
It Occurred in the North Sea.
London, June 2. Picking its
way from its base in the Kiel
canal, the German high seas
fleet on Wednesday afternoon
entered the North seas and olf
the coast of Jutland engaged a
British fleet throughout the
afternoon and night in what
probably was the greatest naval
battle in the world's history so
far as tonnage engaged and ton
nage uestroyed was concerned.
When the battle ended Great
Britain had lost the battle cruis
ers Queen Mary, Indefatigible
Invincible, the cruisers Defense,
Black Prince and Warrior and
eight torpedo boat destroyers,
while the German battleship
Pommern had been sent to the
bottom by a torpedo and the
cruiser Wiesbaden sunk by the
British gunfire. In addition,
several German torpedo craft
were missing and the small
cruiser. Frauenlob, had last been
seen badly listing and was be
lieved to have gone to the
bottom. These loses have all
been admitted by Great Britain
and Germany.
ENGLAND CONCEDES LOSSES
In addition to Great Britain's
conceded losses, Germany claims
that the battleship Warspite,
sister ship of the Queen Eliza
beth, and one of the largest and
most powerful ships afloat, had
been sunk; that the battleship
Marlborough, a vessel of 25,000
tons, had been hit by a torpedo
and a submarine had been de
stroyed. Great Britain also
addd to Germany's acknowl
edged losses, with the claim that
one dreadr.aught of the Kaiser
class -vessels of 21,700 tons and
carrying a complement of 1,088
men -had b.en attacked and
destroyed by British torpedo
craft; that another battleship of
the same class was believed to
have been sunk by gunfire; that
one battle cruiser had been
blown up and two others damag
ed and that a submarine also had
been sent tr the bottom.
At least 150 fihips on both sides
encaged in the great naval battle
and the damage toother ships
lVMf.VV
besides those acknowledged to
have been sunk was not small.
MUCH LIFE LOST
England has admitted loss of
approximately five thousand men
on the ships sunk and the best
reports from Germany place
their losses at approximately
four thousand. Englands loss
included a rear Admiral and the
captains of several ships.
REPORTS CONFLICTING
The reports from both sides
are conflicting and the number
of men killed may never be ex
actly known except to the na
tions effected as each side tries
tominnimize its losses for the ef
fect it will have on their people,
but one thing is certain and that
is that the Germans, while heavy
losers, held the field as evidenced
by the fact that they picked up
many survivors from British
ship3 that went down.
FIGHT WAS PROLONGED
The battle lasted from six
o'clock in the evening until one
o'clock in the morning and was
a fight to a 'finish. In several
instances the entire crews of
nine hundred men went to the
bottom.
GERMANS MUCH ELATED
Germany was wildly exultant
of the naval victory, flags were
unfurled everywhere, schools
were dismissed and Thanksgiv
ing services were held. It was
evident that the victory was re
garded as another step toward
peace.
Wreck Near Woodward
Train service has been delay
ed east since Monday on account
of a wreck to No 114, the Kansas
City Express at a high embank
ment on the North Canadian just
east of Woodward, Oklahoma.
The engine and baggage coaches
plunged down the embankment,
which had been weakened by
the high water from the in
cessant rains, into ten feet of
w ater. The body of the fireman
has not been recovered and was
either washed down stream or
is buried under the engine. The
engineer was also injured. No
train service has been had east
since the accident and 'it will be
several days before passengers
can te transferred.
J. F. Smithson, the Grady
real estate dealer, was in town
Wednesday. He reports a heavy
rain in the Grady country Sun
day evening, also some destruc
tive hail, which in spots fell as
large as hen eggs. The wheat
crop was much be nefitted by the
soaker.
Will and Dick Polk and fami
lies. Dr. J. D. Lynch and Pearl
Sammons and wife were up from
Melrose Tuesday to attend the
bankers convention.
J. S. Edwards, former Clovis
banker, who is now located at
Slaton, was among the visitors
attending the convention Tues
day and shaking hands with old
friends.
