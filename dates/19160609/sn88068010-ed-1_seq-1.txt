AUTO UPSET
Grain Inspector Winn Escaped
Lost Control of Car .
Sunday afternoon as grain in
specter Winn and Mrs. Winn of St
Joe were on their way to this City
to spend the night on their Irip
from St Joe to Fayette and oth
er points, their car was over
turned in the deep ditch near the
Redding farm north of Mike on
the highway were the new
bridge has been built but the ap
proaches not yet put in, and for
crossing purposes a low bridge
in the bottom of the ditch.
When the dangerous crossing
was reached Mrs. Winn got out
of the car, a large Elkhart, and
Mr.. Winn proceeded to the dan
gerous undertaking. He made
the descent to the low bridge and
nearly to the top of the 70 degree
incline on the south side when
his engine went dead and his car
started back. He saw his danger
and did the wrong thing-that is,
he gave his steering wheel a
twist the wrong way and the car
shot thru the fence and turned
upside down with the driver un
der it. However Mr. Winn had a
second in which to throw him
self to the bottom of the car from
under the wheel and to this act
he owes his life or at least his es
cape from serious injury. Had
he been in his seat when the car
landed he surely would have
been crushed.
Of course he lost no time craw
ling from under tho the space
was apparently less than half
large enough for a man of his
size to get thru, and recovering
from his .fright., he . rescued . the
traveling accoutrements from
the underside of the car and
from the streaming oil and gas
which was pouring from their
tanks while Mrs. Winn thanked
Providence that matters were no,
worse, bad as they were.
Neighbors gathered and pas
sing auto loads volunteered help
and with the aid of blocks and
tackle which had been used in
the construction of the steel
bridge and abouc 50 willing
hands, the car was landed on the
bank in a bad'y tumbled-up con
dition. Worn out with hard work Mr.
Winn was deeply sympathized
with by all to whom he extended
his most grateful acknowledge
ments, for their asisitance and
sympathy and abnut y:30 they
hunted a place to rest .and re
main until they could get in con
dition for the resumption of their
journey. ,
Robert P. Clarkson
. Visited Confederate Home
Uncle Bob Clarkson returned
Monday from a three days trip
to the Confederate home at Hig
. gansville. He got a cerficate
from 1 st Lieut R--F. Renick
and Jas. W. Renick and H. H,
Johnson all of his company dur
ing the war was Co. H 4th Reg I
Martin E. Green's Brig, which
certification says, that from 1861
to 1865 Uncle Bob . was on the
firing, line .every time he was
present , Uncle Bob met Capt
ain; Cobb for the first time in 5.8
- years and Henry Johnson since
- August 1863 and they easily rec
ognized the old soldier. ;
; Uncle Bob decorated the grave
of his brother buried at the Con
federate Cemetery." . The iron
cross which was , presented ' by
the Gen. Sterling Price Camp
of the city to the veteran, he lost
and the officers at Higginavillt
gave him another which the in
trepid, unreconstructed old sol
dier proudly wears.

Marceline -3 Novinger 4 ; ;,'
The game between Novinger
and Marceline on the fine home
team grounds Saturday, resulted
in the defeat ofMrceline 5-3
and the Sunday': game 43 in
favor of Novinger, T i
Thrash of Keyteaville was in
the box for Marceline Saturday
and it is said that bad he receiv
ed the support that Tracy Lan
caster got Sunday, the ; score
would have been 81 in favor
of Marceline. Only three hits
were made off Thrash but in and
outfield errors and generally slow
work turned the trick. Thrash
played a faultless game at second
Sunday and but for a fumble by
Shirley the score would have
been .tied in the ninth. Two
wild pitches by Lancaster really
lost the game, but be it said to
his credit that he is good in the
box until h crisis is reached, then
he is uncertain of himself. How
ever, if there are any clubs in
the state except the Blues,
which think they can walk away
with the Novinger 9, let them
place themselves and learn that
it takes good work to defeat the
boys from the short grass sec
tion. In fact, Novinger has a
club of which it should be proud,
every man on the team being a
good ball player. Marceline also
has an excellent club which will
be improved considerably by a
third baseman who can also stop
a ball and throw it as well as hit
one occasionally, and we might
add that a pinch pitcher to put
in the box when such emergen
cies arise would change scores,
especially on other than the
home grounds.
We wish to say a word about
the clean ball played Sunday at
Marceline. - -The Aunpire- was res
pected by all players and not a
word of wrangling was heard on
the ground during the entire
game, a source of gratification
to those who pay their money to
see ball played rather than to
listen to the coarse jargon of
some yawp or yaps. Such speil
trs seldom play ball but think
they can and they are not only
an abomination but a disadvant
age to those who know some
thing of the game.
Start, Stop, Fly Back
Cud Wilson and Dick .Carter
got as far as Brunswick Tuesday
on their far western start view

G. 0. P. and Moose Conventions

concerned.
Big Meeting of Protesters Sat
. urday Organized To Fight
Many if not all of those, living
along the lower section of the
Chariton river ditch met pursu
and to call Saturday and formed
an organization for the purpose
of resisting the levey for more
tax with which to make and
keep up repairs on that" portion
of the drainage ditch.
Sam Heiman was selected for
chairman of the organization,
0. P. Ray Secty. and Oscar
Wood Trsr. and a fond was
raised for 'securing the opinion
of Judge Williams of Booneville
as to whether or not those here
tofore taxed for ditch building
can be further taxed for main-
tainance purposes. If Judge
Williams says that they can be
so taxed under the law. then
perhaps the matter will end and
the new tax paid, otherwise,
otherwisely. ,
