EXTENSIVE OPERATIONS
IN WELSH OIL FIELD
The Republic Production Company,
of Houston, Texas, has just completed
a 112 foot derrick at the Welsh Oil
Field preparatory to drilling for deep
ol. Thiity-three hundred feet of hea
vy drill pipe is already on the ground
and the heavy drilling rig which has
been shipped from the Humble Oil
Field should be set up and in opera
tion before another week has pass
ed.
We feel that this is the most prom
ising effort ever made to bring in a
real oil field here, and the land own
ers are to be congratulated in secur
ing this development of their hold
ings by such a successful and reli
able company.
It is understood that practically all
of the land for one and one-half miles
square has been leased by this com
pany.

WELSH WINS, 7 TO 3.
The Welsh ,Base Ball Team de
feated the Elton Nine on the Sports

interesting one in as much as the

numerous close plays, in which they
showed a wonderful familiarity with
the elusive sphere. The Elton boys
played a fairly good gamd, and took
their defeat with the best grace.
