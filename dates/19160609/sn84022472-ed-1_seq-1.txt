fOUNGSTERS MISS NOONDAY
UIEAL TO WITNESS DELAYED '
x, PARADE OF GREATEST SHOW
Undaunted by the delay of over1
two hours in the start of the circus
parade, thousands of Bridgeporters,
young and old, gathered, on the streets
this noon to witness the gorgeous pa
geant that is always the forerunner
tot the magnificent performances of
the "Greatest Show on Earth."
Threatening skies and barren dinner
tables mattered not, for the parade.
Was surely to be -held and many a
youngster went hungry to witness the
procession of elephants, camels and
the other features that are always
a part of any- reputable circus.
Delays in train connections and the
bad weather that has been the mis
jfortune of the circus folks for the
last week are laid as the basis of the
late tcoming of the company which
ordinarily strikes Bridgeport in the
wee small hours of the morning. These
holdbacks prevented the holding of
the street procession at the stated
hour but a matter of a few hours
mattered not to those who were bent
on witnessing the parade.
People began congregating on the
rtreets over which the parade was
to be held as early as 9 o'clock and
youngsters pleaded with their parents
to be allowed to run to the middle
W. Bishop-of Bridgeport. Both were
for King.
. Col. Ullman -made "a warm plea for
Henney's retention. ,'- He" said the ver
dict against Henney was that "he isn't
enough of a politician" to suit the G.
O. P. leaders of Connecticut.

the endeavor, to see if the parade was
coming. Instead of the parade sev
eral automobiles were driven over the
route about 10 o'clock and announc
ers stated that the parade would be
postponed until 1230 o'clock.
With downcast heads and heavy
footsteps youngsters dragged their
way wearily home but mothers were
constantly annoyed by the children
who sought to hurry her in the prep
aration of the noonday meal, . They
bolted their food, with the rapidity
of the sword swallower that they
would witness in the afternoon. But
as soon as dinner was over they im
mediately returned to their former
station to await this time the coming
of the performers.
At 12:45 o'clock Fred Bradna got
into the cabriolet and the parade was
on. A group of horsemen carrying
small banners followed and then in

Admitting on the - witness stand in
the city court that he waa a profes

when he was arrested" last Saturday
evening he was innocent, Jacob Frost
of New York, who with Jacob Korn is
accused of opening, the handbag of
Mrs. Eva Hibbard of Benham avenue
in a crowd on Main street and extract
ing her purse containing a sum of
money, were arraigned this- morning.
Their cases were continued until
Tuesday under bonds of $1,000 each.

Interestedly watching tiio. .,t,
Mrs. Hibbard paid slight attention to
the iostlinr'er that jsTio nro .t,

husband had been standing with her
but Frost had managed to Jostle his
"'to mo crowd between them
Feeling a tug at her purse, she
glanced to see that it was open. No
ticing that the pocketbook had been
taken and that Frost was walking
away, she followed him and at the
edge of the crowd asked if he had
taken the pocketbook. He denied the
charge, but her husband had sum
moned Seery and he arrested him.
Korn was seen to be edging around
the crowd and hurrying up Main
street, so Policeman Coles took him
into custody. They were taken to
headquarters, but stoutly denied the
charge.
While their cases were continued
in the city court, their Bertillon meas
urements were take-i and sent to all
of the principal cities of the East by
Sergeant Haux. The New York au
thorities replied that they were pro
fessional pocket pickers and sent their
records. .
Frost, whose aliases are Hyman Te
pofsky and Louis Goldstein, was ar
rested in 1907 and sentenced to 17
months in the House of Refuge; in
May, 1910, sentenced tti 13 months in
the same institution; May, 1912, pro
bated for one year, but arrested in
August, 1912, and sentenced to one
$500 fine. Immediately after serving
cms sentence iits was arreteu ai voney
Island afid given a six months sen
tence. He received a like sentence in
April, 1915. -All of his arrests were
made on the charge of disorderly con
duct. , Korn is also known as Julius Levine
and Samuel Rosen. The latter is the
name that he gave here when arrest
ed. In April, 1914, he was sentenced
to 30 days in the workhouse for dis
orderly conduct: October, 1914, two
months; January, 1915, four months;
November, 1915, burglary, discharged,
and March, 1916, arrested in Newark,
but no disposition was made of the
cafe. , '
The pocketbook was not found on
either Frost or Korn and it is bolieved
that they passed it to a confederate,
probably a woman. Frost claims that
he had his hands in his pockets dur
ing the entire time that he was in the
crowd and could not have taken the
pocketbook.

Interview On
Peace Fraud,

U. S. Ambassador at Berlin
Denies That He Author
ized Publication of Discus
sion of Possible Mediation
By President Wilson.
Berlin, June 9. The American am
bassador, James. W. Gerard; has re
pudiated an interview recently attrib
uted to him on the subject of Pres
ident Wilson's peace' efforts, the Over
yeas New Agency says. The ambas
sador also is quoted as asserting that
Count Friederich Von Westarp, con
servative leader in the Reichstag, de
sired Mr. Gerald to have a spurious
interview published some time ago but
that the ambassador declined.
According to a statement given out
by the news agency today, a manu
script containing a copy of the spuri
ous Interview was submitted to Mr.
Gerard, with the idea that it was to
have been published in the National
Zeitung, but the ambassador refused
to sanction it. The statement follows:
"It was stated to a staff member of
the Vossische Zeitung that he never
made the utterance in regard to Pres
ident Wilson's proposed peace media
tion attributed to him and quoted in
the Reichstag. The conservative lead
er. Count Von Westarp, said that Mr.
Gerard had announced President Wil
son's intention to mediate for ' peace
and for this purpose to exert pressure
on the belligerents, which he (Count
Von Westarp) was unwilling to agree
to.
"Mr. Gerard now states that Count
Von Westarp had decided that we
have a spurious interview published
some time ago by the National Zei
tung that he was unable to give him
any information.-. On seeing the man
uscript Mr. Gerard declared that it
was untrue and therefore withheld the
manuscript.
"Mr. Gerard makes formal denial of
the spurious interview."

O. P. Will (Consider Name of Roosevelt, Nomi
nated By Senator Fall Borah Visits Bull
Moose Convention "To Get an Inspiration,"
And Gathering Adjourns Quickly After His
Visit.
While nominating speeches were placing several candL
dates for. the presidency .before the Republican convention in
Chicago today, Senator Borah strolled over to the Auditorium
where the Progressives were in convention.
The Senator was given an ovation as he stepped to the plat
form. He said he had come there unofficially "to get an inspira
tion." ' , -
His visit caused a wave to sweep over the hall, suggesting
that other things than harmony, with Borah as the central fig
ure, might happen. He made a brief speech and his reference
to Col. Roosevelt were punctuated by shouts of "We Want Ted
dy."' . '
The Progressive convention recessed until 3 o'clock, short
ly after Borah's visit.
At the Coliseum, Republican delegates listened to nominat
ing speeches. Governor Whitman, of New York, nominated
Justice Hughes. There was a demonstration lasting 20 minutes
as he concluded. j '

WHITMAN NAMES
HUGHES BEFORE
G. O. P. MEETING
Coliseum, Chicago, June 9 Fol
lowing night of conferences with
the "pece committee" of the Pro
gressivesj the Republicans came to
the third day's convention with a feel
ing thafc harmony was still far off.
The report of the conference com
mittee of Republicans showed that
the Bull Moosers would be perfectly
satisfied if the Republicans - would
name Colonel Roosevelt. The Report
said the conference was "frank .uiid
friendly."
It was expected that further
"peace" meetings would be held this
afternoon;.
The first nominating speech of the
convention came at 11:41 when Gov
ernor Whitman of New York took
the stage to present Justice Hughes'
name. The mention of former Presi
dent Taft's name brought a demon
stration that lasted six minutes.
At 11:17, Chairman Harding got
the meeting in order and the conven
tion stood while Bishop William F.
McDowell offered prayer.
Senator Smoot read the report of
the peace conference. (The report is
printed elsewhere in The Farmer.)
When Mr. Smoot came to the an
nouncement that the Progressives had
urged that Col. Roosevelt had the at
tributes of "the most desirable candi
date upon which to unite," there were
applause, cheers and some hisses.
There were cries of "Roosevelt," a
jangling of cowbells and more cheers.
Senator Smoot held up his hand for
silence but the demonstration, coming
from different parks of the hall, con
tinued. Some few tried to hiss down
the demonstration.
At cries of "Order, order," Chairman
Harding banged the gavel and the
noise subsided. Scattering applause
and some laughter marked the close
of the reading of the report.
Applause and cheers marked the an
nouncement by Chairman Harding
that the conferees would continue
their work.
- Then came the big business the
nomination of candidates. 'The roll of
states was called and Alabama and
Alaska passed. Arizona yielded to
New York.
Governor Whitman, of New York,
was recognized and took the platform
to nominate Justice Hughes. The
demonstration subsided while Gov
ernor Whitman was being introduced.
His declaration that "Wo are here
to choose the next President," was ap
plauded. Then the governor went on
to a denunciation of President Wil
son's foreign policy and declaration
that the 'prosperity of the country only
was temporary and dependent wholly
on the war. For the times to come,
he declared, the nation called for "our
greatest statesmen and the Republican
party.
"No man Jiving," he shouted, "can
claim a monopoly of the American
spirit in his heart or in his nature.
The Republican party is full of them."
He was greeted with an outburst
of handclapping and there was an
other wheli he declared the nation
phoiiH p'ways be "prepared and proud
to fight."
There was a demonstration when
Governor Whitman mentioned the
name of William Howard Taft. The
delegates rose, cheeking and waving
I heir hats, and for the first time the
whole body of them were on their feet.
The band struck up and rolled the
cheers along. It was the longest
demonstration of the convention so
far. When it showed signs of dying,

RESTRAINED BY
PARTYLSADEJIS
''Chicago, (Auditorium), June 9 9 -Henry
Allen's description of yester
day'.s, session that it was "a powder
magazine with lots of matches
around," adequately described the sit
uation in the Progressive convention
today.
While the leaders talked, the dele
gates poured in. The Massachusetts
delegation marched in yelling "We'd
better nominate Roosevelt 'before It's
too late."
William Allen White and Gifford
Pinchot, after moving about among
"the delegates reported that the con
vention could not .be restrained the
moment word caYne that nominations
were being made by the Republicans.
It was the determination of the Pro
gressives to .place their nominee in
the field before action could be taken
by the other convention. Col. Roose
velt, it was said, would not be named
by acclamation but with a roll call.
It was 10:26 when Chairman
Robins called the convention to order.
The floor was filled, but alternates'
places in the galleries were not.
The opening prayer was given by
Rabbi" Joseph Stolz, of Chicago. Gen
eral applause followed the prayer.
Chairman Robins brought up the
convention's unfinished business and
the platform, -to be read plank by
plank by Dean William Draper Lewis, ;
chairman of the resolutions commit
tee. The chairman moved the ap
proval of each plank as its reading ,
was finished but said final adoption ,
as ,a whole would be deferred until ;
the entire document had been read,
amendments made and the peace
conferes' report acted upon.
All of the first paragraphs of the
platform were approved by viva voce
vote; later paragraphs were approved
by unanimous consent.
The plans of "Americanism" were
approved without dissenting voice
and without applause.
Mr. Lewis, holding an Indiana
r.roxy, offered an amendment to the
Mexican plank to include criticism of
the "murder" of Americans on the
high seas.
The peace conference committee,
headed by George W. Perkins and
Governor Johnson, arrived at 11:30
and the platform was laid aside.
Mr. Perkins, after . a burst of ap
plause, presented the peace conferees'
report.
Deep silence fell as he began to
read. Mr. Perkins, .before reading
' the report recited how the commit
tees had met several nours last, nisnt
and each drawn a report for their re
spective conventions.
When Mr. Perkins told how Col.
Roosevelt's name had been presented
there was short, loud applause. Yells
and cheers followed the statement that
the Republicans presented no candi
date. There is little applause when
reading of the report was completed.
Rapt attention was given the reading
of the Republican committee's re
port. "We know you love us all," Mr. Per
kins interjected as the names of the
Progressive committeemen were read.
Without any preliminary announce
ment. Senator .Borah entered the Au
ditorium liall at 12:46 p. m., where
the Progressives were assembled in
'convention. He was escorted to the
platform. A tremendous ovation was
given him.
