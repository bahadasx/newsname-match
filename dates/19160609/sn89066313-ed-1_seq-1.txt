Ity I'nilcil Press.
CHICAGO. June '.!.- The reading of

ing on this afternoon. The radicals
were trimmed on the first skirmish,
when the Perk'ns crowd prevented the
immediate nomination of Roosevelt.
The committee apointed to meet the
Republicans is still in existence, Rob

The radicals will undoubtedly make
another effort later to secure balloting
in the hope of having Roosevelt nomi
nated at once. No action has been
taken on the report of the conference
committee.
Senator Rorah, one of the Republi
can confertmce committee, entered the
convention hall today and received a
wild ovation from the Progressive

This isn't a political forecast,
though it sounds like one. It is merely
.i little data gleaned from the city di
rectory, and Wilson Ioes not neces
sarily lead in the number of votes but
only in the number of persons of that
name, and though Teddy hasn't a rep
resentative in the directory, who will
say that the Colonel will not get a
vote?
Democrats say that this is signifi
cant and means that Wilson will have
a walkaway, but certain Hull Moosers
are sitting back and saying that their
man hasn't started yet.

Coin mnt inn Among' Students
for Slimmer Session.
Registration of Summer Session stu
dents was interrupted yesterday after
noon by a large bulldog, evidently in
ent upon "entering."

where the students arrange their
schedules attempted to prevent the
bulldog from getting a course card.
Tlie dog made an angry growl and
burst into the room.
A young woman who was sitting
next the door took one look, screamed
"mad-dog," and took the four-foot
study table in the hurdle, landing on
top of another. This started a small-
sized panic, and in a jiffy the floor was
left to the dog, while the tops of tables
and chairs were overcrowded. Finally
one of the professors ventured over
and patted the dog until a janitor re
moved him from the building.
