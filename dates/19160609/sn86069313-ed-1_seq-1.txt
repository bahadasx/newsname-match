JiiHtlrc Loomi Strong Progressives
Wiuit Roosevelt Mnjr Ho
Dark Horse.
Chicago, Juno 7. Two convou;
tlons assembled in Chicago to-day
ami ono man dominated tho thought
of both of them. In tho ono, his
nniuo was mentioned as a prelude to
a demonstration that, lasted an hour
itud n half. In tho other, tho men
tion of his name would have precipi
tated crisis. The freo convention,
r composed of Progressives, was ono
of the most enthusiastic gatherings
over held, but its inlluenco Is merely
tecatlvo; it can only destroy. The
bound convention, composed of Re
publicans, was dull and spiritless,
but Its Influence is positive; it can
rebuild provided tho ono man says
the word.
Tho man is Theodore Roosevelt
and ho has not yet said tho word
that means tho difference between
nn easy re-election for President
V.'ilscn and a contest that will echo
through American history. Tho fo
cus of tho Chlui'.o convention is at
oyster Hay; the news must come
Irom there.
Another man, a secondary charac
ter In this situation, has maintain
ed silence alBO. He is Charles E.
Hughes, tho probablo nominee of tho
Republican convention unless cer
tain negotiations now in progross
culminate in a very unexpected way.
His followers, determined to-day, as
they havo determined for months,
to proceed to Hughes' nomination
Friday or Saturday without regard
to tho action of tho Progressive con
vention; and the bulk of tho dele
gates to tho Progressive convention
proposo to proceed with tho nomina
tion of Roosevelt.
Tho radical Progressive strategists
bellovo that, if they nominate Roose
velt and the Republicans nominate
Hughes, tho Justice will decline the
factional tender, throw open the Re
publican convention to pandemonium
and permit Roosevelt himself or
somo man of his personal choice to
carry the fusion banner. The Hughes
strategists hellevo that, If they nom
inate their man on a certain platform
and ho makes a certain typo of accep
tance speech, Roosovolt will got off
tho track and support tho Justice.
A new spirit began to Invade tho
Republican ranks to-night. Many
hitherto conservative leaders de
clared tho- situation "Intolerable"
and proposed to begin balloting to
morrow night. They talk of forcing
tho Issue of "calling tho bluff."
Uornh and others favor this. Pen
roso hangs hack. Tho aggresslves
talk of putting llfo into tho Repub
lican convention to-morrow, of
spreading the word that tho lashed
delegates may cheer.
It amounts almost to a movo to
defy tho undeniable, to beard tho
Colonel. They aro mustering their
courngo to-night; to-morrow they
may bo scared again.
A fow leaders on both sldeB, and
poworful leaders, too, nro negotia
ting and conferring. Various re
ports uro at largo concerning tho pro
gress of theso conferences. Senators J
Penrose, llorah and Lodgo, on tho
ono sldo, and Georgo W. Perkins, on
tho other, aro hopeful that they aro
going to solvo tho tangle and recon
cile tho lrreconcllablcs. Former
Senator Crauo and Senator Smoot do
not bollove It can bo dono In that
way. A harmony Committee Is pro
posed, Its duUes to agree on a can
dldato and a platform mutually ac
ceptable. It had not been appoint
ed early to-night; the convention
may appoint It to-morrow. Courier

COMPENSATION LAW
UPHELD KY COURT
Frankfort, Ky., Juno G. The
Court of Appeals declared tho work
men's compensation law constitution
al. Tho opinion holds tho law In keep
ing with tho court's direction as to
how far tho Legislature might go
under tho decision on tho 1914 act,
which held that act unconstitutional.
Ono provision only was left In doubt,
that which provides that alien wid
ows and orphans will receive only
half tho amount which tho law pro
vides for defendants of workmen
killed by accident. The Court declin
ed to pass on that, but said that. If It
should prove unconstitutional when
a case conies up Involving It, It
would not affect tho validity of tho
act as a whole.

INDIAN WANTS TO
DIE IN TRENCHES
SIR PARTAII SINGH, 71 YEARS
OLD, JOINS SOLDIERS IN '
FRANCE.
London, June 6. Sir Partab
Singh, the famous soldier of India,
wants to die in the trenches if ho has
to die, and, although the Indian
troops havo gone from France to
other fighting zones, Sir Partab has
returned to the western front at his
own request. This veteran Indian
fighter, 71 years of age, comes of tho
mighty Rajput warriors and since
youth has followed the life of a sold
ier. An Indian writer in one of
London's newspapers, in telling tho
story of Sir Partab, says:
"Thirty-eight years ago, Sir Par
tab went to Kabul ns a member of
the mission that was sent there.
Nineteen years later he accompanied
the Mohmand expedition as extra aid
de camp to Gen. Ellis. The next year
he served In tho samo capacity with
Gen. Lockhart In the Tlrah campatgn
on tho Indian Northwest frontier.
While serving in the last campaign
ho recolved a wound In the hand,
which In fact, with his characteristic
stoicism, ho hid from everybody un
til the general noticed it and ordered
the doctor to attend it Just In time
to avoid blood poisoning.
When tho Indian troops woro being
sent to assist In quelling tho Boxer
rebellion In China, Sir Partab per
suaded Lord Curzon, tjjen viceroy
and governor general of India, to let
him accompany tho expeditionary
force. While serving In China tho
maharaja learned to hato tho Pruss
ians, who went out of their way to
treat him and other Indian rulers as J
"coolies."
"Sir Partab is as good an admin
istrator ns ho is a soldier. His ad
ministrative genius has been dem
onstrated by the work that ho did In
Jodhpur a state more than threo
times tho slzo of Belgium and with
about as many Inhabitants as Don
mark during his two terras of reg
ency and another as prlmo minister
of that state. His rule over Idar, a
etno In tho Bombay presidency 2090
square: miles in area, extending from
1002 to 1911, was also progressive
nn.t enlightened. He voluntarily ab
dicated thp gadl (throne)' of Idar in
favor of his adopted boh.
SHACKLKTON TELLS OF
ANARCTIO EXPEDITION
London, June 5. A long dispatch
from Lieut. Sir Ernest Shackleton,
who has arrived at Port Stanley,
Falkland Islands, describes the mis
fortunes which overtook his Antarctic
expedition.
Ills ship Endurance was pierced; by
Icebergs and sank in the WeddelJ Sea
on November 20, having been aban-
!
?
douod by all hands on October 27.
Shackleton and his crew reached
Elephant Island on April 14 In boats,
after a series of privations-and suff
erings In the drift Ice, several of the
party being then, on tho verge of
physical collapse.
Owing to the seriousness of the
food situation and the impossibility
of finding any very satisfactory camp
ing place on the bleak coast, Shackle
ton decided to make an effort to reach
South. Georgia, 760 miles distant,
leaving the main party on Elephant
Island In charge of Frank Wild, tho
second in command.
Lieut. Shackleton left on April 24
with five volunteers. Then ensued
a fortnight of terrible struggles
against blizzards and other difflcul-r
ties, but finally the west coast of
Georgla was sighted.
,
After a mighty effort lasting two!
days they succeeded In beaching their
boat, and four days later arrived
at the head of King Haakon Bay. On '
May 19 they started to cross the Is-J
land, reaching the Stromness whaling
station on May 20. There they ob
tained an eighty-ton Norkeglan whal-.
er for nn attempt to relieve tho men
left behind. I
Tho whaler started south with a'
voluntary crew on May 26, but thoyj
found the Ice too formidable for an
unprotected boat, and after several I
attempts reluctantly decided to turn I
north for assistance to the Falklands. I
The party on. tho beach at Elo-1
pliant Island were all well when '
Shackleton left on April 24. They
had five weeks' provisions, with tho
possibility of re-cnforclng these by
tho capturo of seals.
Tho work of tho expedition to '
date, says Lieut. Shackleton, Includes
tho discovery of 200 miles of new
coast lino, n complete hydrologlcal
survey of the Weddoll Sea, tho elim
ination of South Greenland from tho
map, continuous magnetic and
meteorological observations, import
ant biological observations, cinema
records to October 30, and photo
graphic rccodrs up to date

out of order, thoy contend. The
fight will be carried beforo tho Na

trict. After Maurice Galvln, of Cov
ington, a friend of Col. McCulloch,
had moved that tho meeting proceed
to tho work of organization. Powors

VENTION TURNS LOOSE.
LASTS HOUR AND HALF
New Mexico Asks, "If Roosevelt Were"
President, Where Would
Villa Be?"
Chicago, 111., June 7. Theodore
Roosevelt! The "amo was mention
ed first today in the Progressive Na
tional Convention by Raymond Rob
Ins in his keynote speech.
Teodoro Roosevelt the cry. wai
taken up by a spectator In the gal
lery. Theodore Roosevelt! All over tho
great auditorium the name rose in
one mighty shout and a demonstra
tion, such as can be provoked by no
other name In American public life,
was on in the Progressive National
Convention.
Cheer followed cheer; flags waved;
hats and handkerchiefs were thrown
Into the air and thousands of throats
let loose cheer after cheer.
The band was playing, but only
the motion of the bass drummer as
he swung his arm gave out lntlxmv
tlon of it to the audience. Not A
note could be heard.'
Cheering Unabated.
Minute after minute the cheering
continued. For half an hour It
went on unabated, while the pro
ceedings of the convention came to
a fialti Forty-five minutes went by
and It showed no signs of subsiding.
And all the world knew that the
Progressive National Convention was"
for Theodore Roosevelt first, last
and all the time.
As the demonstration proceeded,
delegation after delegation formed
In line and marched thru the aisles
of the auditorium. The State del
egations nearest the stage marched
across behind the speaker's rostrum,
Jostling tho noted Progressives gath
ered there. The movement for Amer
icanism and preparedness, as ex
pressed by Teodoro Roosevelt, was
reflected In the inscriptions on the
banners carried by the marchers.
Particularly striking were the ban
nered slogans of the Western States
and more especially those bordering
on Mexico. Texas and New Mexico
were especially vociferous In the
general clamor, "We want Teddy."
"No Second Choice."
The New Mexico delegation carried
banners with the Inscriptions:
"Columbus, Now Mexico, Wants Ted
dy for President," and "If Roosevelt
Were President, Whero Would Villa
Bo?" Other banners wero inscrib
ed: "No Compromise," "Wo Have
No Second Choice" and "Teddy Will
Not Pussyfoot."
Tho demonstration continued for
ono hour and thirty-three minutes,
thereby establishing a record for sus
tained applause in an American po
litical meeting.
The complete time from tho begin
ning after Robins had declared
Roosovelt tho "foremost American
citizen" to tho moment when ho was
able to rcsurao his keynote speech
was ono hour and forty minutes. The
longest period of applauso hereto
fore was the demonstration, lasting
flfty-soven minutes, which was giv
en Roosovelt at the Progressive Con
vention of 1912. Louisville Herald.
