Amalgamation is Possible
Only in Case Roosevelt
Himself Agrees to De

Irteriuitlotial News Service:
i.'HIi'AtJo. June 0. Conferenes
of republican leaders wer? renewed
this morning to endeavor to frame a
program of procedure for the con
tinuance of the peace conference.
St'ns. I'orah and Smoot discussed the
situation and decided to leave the
matter to the convention. They were
of the opinion that if the republicans
did. not nominate at today's session,
and the progressive leaders weru
able to delay the nomination of
Roosevelt by the bull moose dele
gates, the conference would auto
matically be resumed after "both con
ventions adjourned.
There was some discussion of a
possible, resolution U be presented
to the republican convention specifi
cally authorizing further conferences
but the leaders believed that such a
resolution would be unnecessary, if
the day's session proved indecisive.
Some republican leaders favored a
plan under which the convention
would confine itself to action on the
report of the conference committee.
Immediately after it was adopted it
was proposed und, this plan to re
cess to allow a further conference.
Other leaders proposed to have the
nominating speeches made before
a recess was taken. Still otheis
thought that a test of strength
should be made and that one of two
ballots on candidates should be
taken, and then if no nomination
was made, the conference could go
on.
ICHs4'V-lt Must Cio.
Lnlcss Col. Theodore Roosevelt
sh ill eliminate himself as a candi
date for president peace between the
republican and progressive parties is
im possi ide. That was the judgment
of the leaders of the republican
party when its convention reas-j-einbb-,1
here today.
The peace conference was ready to
r port '"progress." but that was all
that could lie said. The progressive
party committee had agreed that
there would be no trouble in getting
together on any question of policy.
Rut it insisted that Theodore Roose
velt was the only man to lead the
tight of a reunited party. And the
insistence was of such a character
that the republican leaders saw littl
rope. So it was decided that unless
tl e situation cleared up the conven
P
tion would proceed to the next order
c! business and let the candidates
be placed in nomination. 1
The piogressive leaders, insisted
that they did not know just what
they would do. Their delegates
were anxious to ro ahead and nom
inate .'ol. Roosevelt and put the is
sue of whether he would he accept
ed by th republicans, or whether
that party preferred to go down
again to defeat, squarely i.p to the
republhan convention. The progres
sive leaders of course could prevent
this, but whether they would do so
inly they themselves know.

r(l. Roosevelt talked by telephone

Suffrage Issue
Hangs in Air in
Both Conventions
Intermit ional News Service:
CHICAGO. June 9. A lively and
interesting situation has developed
in the suffrage problem before both
conventions. That one may come by
an adequate understanding of the
case, let it be remembered that the
women who are here lighting for the
ote demand that the two parties
shall favor the giving of the vote to
women by national action. This, be
it understood, is no combination of
ktate conventions.
' The republicans incorporated in
their platform a clause favoring suf
frage, but insisting that the ques
tion be left to the states for action.
No national aid for the cause w-ii
promised. Which, said the were en,
was only the negative well-w ishin?
of a party that had sent along its
compliments without any invitation
to a political dinner.
On the 'moose other hand, the
platform, as it was read to the wom
en in the original draft, called for
full suffrage, to be obtained by both
rational and state legislation. When
the platform appeared for adoption
in the convention it read differently.
The word "both" had been lost in
the shuffle and the word "either'
replaced it. followed by "or." Thus
the platform was noncomm',.tal upon
a vital point.
Delegate I fear's Shift.
Delegate Cost igan's quick ear caught
the shifting of the words. He brought
the matter to the attention of the
convention and a dashing woman
delegate from Illinois in the first
f'oor fight ever made by a woman in
the history of American conventions,
insisted upon the restoration o. .he
verbal masterpiece to its original
status.
The whole matter was left in the
air along with the rest of the plat
form, and it constitutes one of the
main points of issue between the two
conventions.

REPORT FILED BY
G.O.P. CmiTTEE
Roosevelt's Name is Mention
ed Progressives Say He's
the Logical Man.
Iiiteiii.itii.iuil News Service:
COIJ.ElM, CHICAGO. June
The Roosevelt managers sprung
their final trump card today.
Through the pe-ice committee which
conferred with a similar committee
of the progressive party last niyht
the Roosevelt men brought squarely
to the attention of the republican
convention the desirability of the
nomination of Col. Roosevelt in the
following words:
"'The progressive conferees were
unanimous in urging with temper
ateness and fairness the opinion that
Theodore Roosevelt of New York,
had so large a personal following
and such a close personal relation
to the issues of the coming campaign
as to make hi n a most desirable
candidate upon which to unite."
The committee made no recom
mendation whatever. It put the
whole thing squarely up to the (on
vention. Its complete report, which
was presented by ir'en. Smoot, chair
man of the committee, was simply
a statement of facts. Rut it em
phasized the fact that the republi-I
an and propres-si ve parties niusi-
i.nite on candid ttes if they were to
have a chance to win. And it was
on this and the knowledge that the
progressives were solidly lined up
lor Col. Koosevelt that the tatter's
active manager-" relied to set the
nomination across.
The complete report of the com
mittee was as follows:
"To the repu dican national con
vention: ""Your committee appointed pur
suant to tip- resolution adopted at
yesterday's session, met in confer
ence with a committee representing
the national progressive convention
last evening. The progressive com
mittee of conference consisted of
Messrs. Perkins of New York: .John
son of California; Rona parte of
Maryland: Wilkinson of New York,
and Parker of Louisiana.
"The conference was Hank, free
ami most friendly.
"The conferees were of nie mind
in believing that the god of the
country and perhaps its repute and
influence for years tj come depends
on the complete defeat of the pres
ent democratic administration and
the restoration cf the control of the
executive and legislative branches of
the g"o eminent to th hands of
those who firmly believe in and will
execute the policies that are so
heartily supported by the republican
and the progressive parties alike.
"The progressive conferees were
unanimous in urging with temper
ateness and fairness the vpinion that
Theodore Roosevelt of New York,
pad so large a personal following
and such a close personal relation to
the issues of the coming campaign
as to make him the ms.t desirable

COLISEUM, CHICAGO, June 9. If the leaders can keep con.
trol of the republican convention there will be no nomination to
day. They want another session of the peace committee with the
progressive party committee tonight.
The republican leaders went into a new conference as soon as
the progressive convention recessed. Sens. Smoot and Lodgx?,
Murray Crane, National Chairman Hilles and William B. McKinley
were closeted together for nearly an hour. They communicated
with George VV. Perkins and other progressive leaders and both
sides agreed that chances for peace would be greatly increased if no
nomination was made by either convention today.
Sen. Lodge of Massachusetts, said at 1 :50 that he did not be
lieve Col. Roosevelt would be asked to come to Chicago.
"The colonel will not come," he said. "He cculd not get here
in time to help."
Nominaitons were in rder at the
republican convention this after
noon. Following the nominating
speeches for Justice Charles Rvans
Hughes and Elihu Itoot. denmnsttn
tions were in order and the suc

outbursts.
A woman diesse! in blue played

stampede four years ago.

of the republican party. While

Krank Hitchcock, carefully groom

The prayer of Risliop McDowell,
which pened the ilay's session, was
