Of It Is Worth a Perusal
Winslow Bank Represented Here
Llovd C. Henning. retiring
cashier of the Holbrook State
Rnk. has acceDted a flattering
offer made by T. M. Quebedeaux,
vipe-nresident of the Arizona
State Bank at Winslow and lar
o-par arnokhnlder therein, to re-
present the Winslow institution
in this territory, which will also
include Navajo and Apache
counties. This bank's advertise
ment appears in another column
nf Thf News, with the name of
Mr. Henning as representative
Mr. Henniner was the first
cashier of the Holbrook branch
of the Navajo-Apache Bank &
Trust Co., and remained in that
position for seven years until
the bank was purchased by Mr.
Quebedeaux and resold by him
to Albuquerque capitalists. His
long experince in the business,
together with his wide acquain
tance among the citizens of
Navajo and Apache counties,
make him exceptionally well fit
ted to act as the representative
of the Arizona State bank.
These facts, as well as Mr.
Henning's other qualifications
for the banking business, were
recognized by Mr. Quebedeaux,
and he made Mr. Henning so
good an offer that it could not
be declined.
Alleged Bootlegger Captured
Tuesday morning about 3:30
o'clock Undersheriff W. G.
demons arrested Charley Ross,
of Winslow, upon the charge of
violating the prohibitory law.
The arrest was made 5 miles
west of Adamana, on the Hoi-brook-Gallup
road, and was
effected after a nearly all-aight
vigil.
Ross, accompanied by "Dad"
Roberts, and aged and infirm
citizen of Winslow. was enroute
west in an Overland automobile,
bearing the number 6184. the
same car used by Tom Meyers,
now serving a sentence in the
county jail for illegally trans
porting intoxicating liquor into
the state.
The sheriff's office had re
ceived advices early in the even
ing to watch for men with a
large quantity of liquor in an au
tomobile. When Undersheriff de
mons found the men they were
asleep on the ground near their
car. In the car were 26 gallons
of whiskeji- two 10-gailon kegs,
one 5-gallon keg and four quart
bottles. Men and booze were
brought to the county jail, Ross
being locked up and Roberts,
who was sick, being allowed to
go to his home in Winslow.
Ross was arraigned by County
Attorney Jordan Thursday morn
ing in Judge Boyer's court. He
pleaded not guilty and was bound
over to the superior court. It is
understood that he will fight
conviction upon the ground that
the liquor was brought into the
state for his own personal use.
Road Commission Reports
The report of the road com
missioners appointed by the board
of supervisors a month before
was made to the board at the
regular meeting of that body last.
Monday. The fi ve mem bers of the
commission were present in per
son and they had prepared a
detailed report as to the amount
of money needed for county roads
and as to where it should be ex
pended. The report was ac
cepted by the supervisors and
final action upon the matter was
postponed to the regular meet
ing in July.
The recommendations of the
commission were for a bond issue
of $100.000, various lines of road
in the county being designated
for the expenditure of different
sums of money. The commission
further recommended that, in
the event of the taxpayersvoting
the bonds, the board of super
visors appoint a commission of
three to superintend the expendi
ture of the money voted.
The board of supervisors will
probably call an election at the
July meeting and the taxpayers
of the county will then decide
whether or not the $100,000 in
bonds shaH be voted. 1
Lumber Business Changes Owners
Last Saturday a sale was con
summated by which C. P. Cooley
became the owner of the Hol
brook branch of the Carbon City
Lumber Co. Mr. Cooley took
possession of the business at
once and has arranged with M.
A. Cousins to retain his old posi
tion. This business was established
in Hilbrook about one year ago
by the Carbon City Lumber Co
nf Calliiri. Mr. Cousins was
placed in charge by the Gallup
owners ana irom me nrst uay
the business has shown a steady
erowth and a good dividend
payer.
Mr. Coolev recently sold his
ranch and cattle interests, and,
after investigating various bus
iness DroDositions here and else
where, decided that nothing bet
ter offered than the proposition
to buy a lumber business.
Mr. Coolev s decision is cause
for gratification among the peo
pie generally. He is a good bus
iness man and is possessed of
sufficient capital to handle the
business in good shape. More
over, ne is a rioiorooic man, ana
the money he makes will remain
in Holbrook.
Sheepherder Shoots Companion
Antonio Martinez, a sheep-
herder in the employ of Frank
Golassary near Dry Lake, was
brought to Holbrook last Satur
day night suffering from two
gun-shot wounds inflicted by
another herder named Max Con
tar eo. The wounded man was
given surgical attention by Dr.
J. W. Bazell and Sunday after
noon was sent to the Milton Hos
pital in Flagstaff. He will proba
bly recover.
The shooting was the result of
a feud which had existed among
the men for some time. A short
time before. Martinez had threat
ened Contareo with a gun, and
had forced him to kneel and beg
for his life. When Martinez had
desisted from his gun-play and
had started away, Contareo
brought his own gun into action
and fired two bullets at his tor
mentor. He then left camp and
has not yet been located by the
sheriff's office.

Kansas City Livestock Prices
Kansas City Stock Yards. June
5, 1916. Good prime steers sold
fifty cents higher last week
some sales of strictly prime steers
75 cents higher, but medium and
low grades of cattle worked lower
and stockers and feeders lost
around 50 cents. Today receipts
amount to 12,000 cattle, and the
market is again stronger on good
to prime steers, also on butcher
grades of cattle on stockers and
feeders, but medium and cheap
steers continue to work lower.
A feature was some strictly prime
pulp fed steers, four cars bring
ing $10.80 and 5 cars $10.75, bulk
of the pulp steers $10. 25 to $10. 75
Strictly prime natives were lack
iiiK, eise cney would sell up
around $11.00. There is a dispo
sition to push immature steers
forward, for feeders realize that
in a short time grass cattle will
be abundant, and prices on them
will be low enough to lead pack
ers to substitute, hence will hurt
all but the best fed cattle. In
the quarantine division 85 cars
arrived, practically all from Tex
as, and a sale at $10.00 made a
high record on quarantine cattle.
Bulk of the quarantine fed steers
were only medium quality, and
sold weak to 10 lower, at $7.50
to $8.75. Some grass steers
brought $6.95 to $7.15, including
6 cars from South Texas at the
latter price, 850 lbs. ayarage.
Stockers and feeders sold strong
er today, most sales of good
steers at $7.75 to $8.00, some
cheap stockers around $7.00.
Hog receipts were 16.000 head,
a thousa m the estimate,
and the maAWtetlowed the lines
laid out last week, largely 10
lower for triyjitfftop $9.40, bulk
$9.10 to $a4fi Demands on
killers is not as urgent as hereto
fore, because of larger supplies,
and a slat ng of consumption,
due to hot weather, and the mar
ket seems slated for a lower level
during June. Good rains over
Kansas andTfcsouri made farm
work imDOSHtmany places,
hence the gee4ipply today, but
a stretch ofary weather might
result in lighter supplies and a
temporary advance, as farm work
must be prosecuted when oppor
tunity offers this month.
Spring lambs are off 50 cents
today, due more to a fictitious
advance last week than to real
weakness in the market, lambs
selling here 25 cents above
Chicago last Thursday. Spring
lambs brought $10.75 to $11.50
today, including medium Arizonas
at $10.85 and $11.00. Arizona
clipped yearlings, 84 lbs. at $8.75.
Native and Arizona ewes are
worth $7. 25 to $7. 75 for slaughter,
breeding ewes $6 to $7. Texas
muttons are lacking, worth $7.25
to $7.75, about 3.000 goats are
here today, fat goats steady,
around $2.25, brushers 10 lower,
$5.00 for good Angoras.

Pigeons as Pets
An idea adopted by the Pan
ama California International
Exposition more than a year ago
to aid in giving a final artistic
touch to the Spanish influenceof
buildings and grounds is rapidly
turning into a commercial pro
position with big returns in
view. Everybody who has visit
ed the San Diego Exposition
knows about the thousands of
tame pigeons that perch on the
shoulders and heads of guests in
search of food.
A few days ago. an eastern
visitor approached one of the
Balboa guards with a beautiful
white pigeon eating wheat from
her hand. "I want to buy this
pigeon" she informed the guard,
"and if yon refuse to sell it, I
promise to steal it and take it
out of the grounds willy nilly. "
The guard reported the matter
to officials and was advised to
ask what the visitor would pay
for the pigeon. Without hesita
tion the visitor offered $2.00,
and she was given receipt for
the pet
At the present time there are
almost 5000 pigeons in the
plazas and almost as many more
ting birds nesting in the pigeons
lofts. Instead of worrying over
the question of carrying for the
enormous increase, Exposition
officials begin to see visions of a
big income from raising "extra
tame" pigeons for the pet market
