Bear Ridge Boosters Club
Deserve Great Credit
Wednesday proved to be a beauti
ful day for the Big Bear Ridge
Booster Picnic. A large crowd was
expected by the managers of the
picnic and their expectations were
more than realized. The road was
lined on both sides for a distance
of a quarter of a mile, with auto
mobiles and other conveyences.
Eyerybody seemingly came with the
idea of having a good time and if
there was a person there who didn't
enjoy the day that person was hard
to please.
The morning program was well
arranged and was carried out in
every detail in a very creditable
manner. N. E. Ware, president of
the Booster's club, made the ad
dress of welcome and outlined the
events of the day. A reading by
Miss Lola Ware was the first num
ber on the program and was well
received. Music by the Kendrick
orchestra followed. A fairy drill
by some of the school children of
Bear ridge was well done after
which the orchestra rendered
another selection. A vocal duet by
Miss Zora Ware and Wallace Reid
was encored. They both have very
pleasing voices. Mr. Ware then in
troduced George Crum, of Lewis
ton, who delivered the address of
the day. His talk was short but to
the point and received the closest
attention from the crowd. This
concluded the morning program.
It was a pleasing sight to see the
hundreds of people eating their
picnic lunches under the big pines.
The lunch hour was probably the
most thoroughly enjoyed part of
the day. The picnic management
advertised free coffee but they
didn't advertise the fact that the
ladies of Bear ridge were going to
furnish free lunch for anyone who
failed to provide for their noonday
meal. A table about thirty feet
long was fairly loaded with pies,
cakes and other good things that
the ladies of Bear ridge know how
to cook.
The after-dinner program began
with another drill by the school
children. They had costumes of
white for the girls and black for
the boys. Then followed a song by
a double quartette of mixed voices
which 'was heartily encored. An
orchestra accompaniment of two
violins and the piano, made this a
very delightful number. Then fol
fowed a talk by Prof. Waite of
Lewis county. He presented some
interesting ideas on some of the
agricultural work and experiments
carried on in Lewis county. The
ball game was the next event of
importance.
The Kendrick team played the
Big Bear ridge team and were de
feated by a score of 13 to 12. Bear
ridge imported a pitcher from
Clarkston but it was an unnecessary
precaution as any one of the eight
Bear ridge players could probably
have pitched as well. The Bear ridge
team has a bunch of batters and
hit the ball hard for a numerous
bunch of hits
Kendrick did some of the most
spectacular, unnecessary wild throw
ing that has been witnessed in this
locality for many years. Over
throws were so common that they
became monotonous. The score was
tied the first half of the ninth inn
ing but Bear ridge secured one in
the last half and won the game.
A bucking contest was held after
the ball game and although it was
getting rather late, quite a crowd
stayed to witness the wild west per
formance.
It is hoped that Bear ridge will

Publishers Meet at Juliaetta
The Latah County Press Associa
tion spent Saturday with Editor
Semmes of the Juliaetta Indepen
dent. A business meeting was held
in the morning and an auto ride
over the Potlatch ridge was. very
much enjoyed in the afternoon. E.
W. Porter, Juliaetta's most consist
ent booster, took his car and Mr.
Lamphere of the Idaho Post put his
into service.
The object of holding the meeting
at Juliaetta was to bring the fact
before the Press Association that a
new road connecting Moscow and
Juliaetta could be built up the
Middle Potlatch making an average
grade of about two per cent and
cutting off several miles from the
; present route. It is Mr. Porter's
I idea that some day this grade would
be used as a part of the national
i highway as it is the only water
■ grade connecting this section of the
country with the country farther
! east.
Automobile Accident
A serious automobile accident
occurred on Big Bear ridge Wed
nesday afternoon. Oscar Gustaf
son and Carter Aspalin were driv
ing in a car and ran over a dog at
the corner of Elmer McGraw's
place. The car tipped over and
threw the occupants out breaking
Gustafson's left arm between the
shoulder and elbow. Aspalin re
ceived a severe scalp wound. The
car rolled over and then righted
itself. It was not very badly
damaged. The dog was not killed,
so of course you know it was a
I Ford car.

The

and
pre
Tratst
If you work for a man, in Heaven's name work
for him. If he pays wages that supply your bread
and butter, work for him, speak well of him, think
well of him, and stand by him, and stand by the in
stitution he represents. I think if I worked for a
man, I would work for him. I would not work for
him a part of his time, but all of his time. I would
give an undivided service or none. If put to the
pinch, an ounce of loyalty is worth a pound of clever
ness If you must vilify, condemn, and eternally
disparage, why, resign your position, and when you
are outside, damn to your heart's content. But. I
pray you, so long as you are a part of an institution,
do not condemn it. Not that you will injure the in
stitution—not that—but when you disparage the con
cern of which you are a part, you disparage yourself.
And don't forget—"I forgot" won't do in business.
—Elbert Hubbard.
Larger Postal Deposits
Larger postal savings deposits will
now be accepted at the post office.
This is made possible by an import
ant amendment to the Postal Sav
ings Act just approved by President
Wilson.. A postal savings depositor
may now have an account amount
ing to $1,000 upon which interest
will be paid. Formerly $500 was
the maximum amount he could
have to his credit. This enlarge
ment of postal savings facilities will
be very gratifying to thousands of
depositors who have already reached
the old $500 limit and are anxious
to entrust more of their savings to
Uncle Sam. Another feature of
the amendment that will avoid
further ernbarrasment to the publie
and to postal officials is the doing
away with the limit on the amount
that could be accepted from a
depositior monthly. Under the old
law only $100 could be deposited in
a calendar month. The amendment
abolishes this restriction. While
the Postal Savings System has al
ready proved a signal success as is
shown by the fact that more than
half-a-Million depositors have over
eighty million dollars standing to
their credit, still it has fallen short
of meeting the full demands of
the public because of the restric
tions which have now been elimi
nated. Postmaster General Burle
son and Third Assistant Postmaster
General Dockey have been tireless
in their efforts to secure a modifi
cation of the limitations and the
new liberalizing legislation is parti
cularly gratifying to them.
Camp Fire Girls
The Camp Fire Girls had their
first out-door meeting last Thurs
day night, June 1. They met up
the Patlatch near the Jacobs' hole.
Before the meeting all the girls
worked hard, gathering up wood
for the 'Camp Fire. This was a
ceremonial meeting and all but six
of the members were present.
New officers for the following
months were elected as follows:—
Louise Flaig, treasurer; Lucile
Grenolds, Keeper of the Court;
Mabel McKeever, musician.
The honor beads were awarded
and several other business matters
were discussed.
After the meeting adjourned
lovely refreshments were served by
the assistant guardians, Miss Anna
Long and Miss Grace Florance. The
refreshments were sandwiches,
wienes, and marshmallows. All the
girls had a lovely time roasting
wienes over the camp fire.

excellent entertainment and sincere
ly hope it will not be the last.

Boy's Quartette
The Kendrick Boys' Quartette
will go to Lewiston Sunday to sing
in the Methodist church. Rev.
Whitney, leader of the Whitney
Boys' Chorus of Spokane, is to
preach. He heard the quartette
sing last week while he was in Ken
dricK and spoke very highly of
their work. He thought so much
of their singing that he offered to
take them with the 1100 boy singers
who are going to tour the east
concert work in the future. He
wants the boys to represent the
chorus as their quartette.
Bitten by Rattle Snake
Last week the little daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Burl Emmett was
bitten by a rattlesnake. The little
girl was playing in the yard and
reached down to pick something off
the ground when the snake bit her
on her left thumb. Her hand was
beginning to turn black before she
told her parents about it. They
immediately brought her to the
doctor and though she was very ill
for several days she has entirely
recovered now.
JULIAETTA WILL
! JOLD PICNIC
Three Day Session, June 22,
23 and 24.
At a meeting of the Juliaetta
Commercial club it was decided to
hold a three days' picnic and bar
Decue and a committee has been
named with C. W. Semmes as chair
man to complete the arrangements.
The dates selected are June 22, 23
and 24 and the people of the entire
surrounding country are cordially
invited to visit Juliaetta and parti
cipate in the festivities.
The Juliaetta picnic for a number
I of years had been one of the fixed
attractions of the Palouse country
and people visited on those occasions
j from various sections. In the past
few years the picnics have been
abandoned but it is the purpose of
the Juliaetta Commercial club to
revive the affair and this year will
result in the greatest demonstration
genuine old-time picnic, weather
conditions being ideal at this time
of the year and the beautiful sur
roundings making it especially
kind. The committee is already at
work securing numerous attractions
for the occasion. Undoubtedly
many people will visit the picnic
from Kendrick.

Juliaetta is an ideal place for a
adapted for holding affairs of this
Kendrick School Newt
The following pupils were neither
absent nor tardy during the entire
term: Walter Benscotter and Roy
Florance in the high school, Ula
Crocker in the eighth grade, Agnes
Ellis in the seventh. Richard Fen
ton in the sixth grade was not ab
sent during the year although tardy
several times. Much praise is due
Walter Benscotter who came four
miles to school every day and in
spite of the unusually severe weather
on more than one occasion, was
[ always in his seat when the last bell
rang. Such a record of perseverance
and punctuality is quite remarkable,
j n th e high school Henry Meyer
takes first place in point of scholar
s hip, having an average of 90. Roy
Florance is a close second with an
average of 89, while Lester Crocker
and Grace Waite have a tie for
third place, each having an average
0 f 88. In the first year class of the
high school Grace Waite has the
highest average 88 and Opal Keeler
ranks second with 86. Perhaps the
most singular fact of all is that the
boys captured both the first and
second honors of the school.
The results of the eighth
grade
examinations show the following
average standings: Chris Zoyer 93,
Elsie Blackburn 92, Ethel Black
burn 90, Eula Crocker 90, Gladys
Keller 90. This is a very gratify
record and is a fair indication
of the quality of work done by the
pu P'* s > n the grades,
reached 166, and in the high school
43, making a total for the year 209.
Next year, with the addition of the
twelfth grade, the total number of
pupils should exceed the 225 mark.

I
GENESEE ANNUAL
JjORSE SHOW
The Dates Are June 15, 16
and 17
The annual Horse Show given by
the citizens of Genesee will be held
this year June 15, 16 and 17. A
crowd of Genesee boosters visited
Kendrick last Friday in the interest
of the show. They came over in
cars, bringing a brass band with
them and gave a concert on Main
street. They spent the entire day
visiting the surrounding towns.
The program for the three days
is a very interesting one and the
event will no doubt be a great
success as it was last year. .
On the first day will occur the
grand exhibition of horses which
has made the Genesee country
famous as a district of high grade
breeding animals. A big parade
will open the exercises after which
prizes will be announced. In the
afternoon the Genesee ball team
w >H meet the Lapwai Indians in a
match game after which other ath
letic sports will be staged.
Friday an automobile parade will
be held and competition is keen
among auto owners which will re
suit in some handsomely decorated
cars being in line. Business houses
promise unique floats. Liberal
prizes will be awarded in various
classes. Some unique entertain
ment will be afforded during the
afternoon in which auto owners will
participate. The preliminaries in
the wild horse race will be staged
Friday afternoon which promises to
create much interest.
Saturday, the last day of the
show, promises to be the biggest
and best from an amusement stand
point. The day will open with a
real frontier life parade and con
siderable old-time equipment will
make its appearance in the parade.
Nez Perce Indians will join the
parade and give a touch of real
border life to the event. The after
ward program will be made up of
wild west features such as bucking
contests, roping and other like
sport. The association has made
arrangements for the presence of
the Bauscher-French carnival at
tractions for three days.

The Commercial Club will meet

Ju 'y 4 - The sentiment generally
seems to be opposed to a Fourth of

should be settled definitely.
The Commercial Club also wishes
to talk over the prospects for a fair
to be held in the fall. Last fall the

New Idça in Grain Boxes
Jim Rodgers is making a grain
box to be used in hauling loose
grain to the elevator. The idea is
one of his own and seems to be a
good one. The box will hold fifty
bushels of grain and is constructed
to prevent the grain from spilling
while hauling it down the grades.
He has a model almost completed
and on exhibition in his shop.
