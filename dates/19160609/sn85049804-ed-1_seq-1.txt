Forethought.
People are learning that a little
forethought
often saves them a big
expense. Here is an instance: E. W.
Archer, aid well, Ohio, writes: "I do
not believe that our family has been
without Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera
and Diarrhoea Remedy since we.com
menced keeping house years ago.
When we go on an extended visit we

SHAPING YOUNG LIVES.
In explaining the addition of the de
partment of education and Industry
the congress officials, with headquar
ters at Nashville, Tenn., stated that
this Is but in keeping with tbe ad
vanced Idea of blending education and
industry In such a way that the Sun
day school people of the present day
HKNBT AIiIIZK BOYD.
will be a tote tr take them ofi.'' Prac
tical study and physical application of
education and industry are the aim and
watchword of this new department'of
the Sunday school congress movement.
Henry Allen Boyd, secretary of this
national organization, in making an
nouncement of the addition of these
two departments stated further that
the Bible study period and the teacher
training department, with the two new
departments added, would give to the
university and the college presidents,
professors and pupils a splendid oppor
tunity to come in touch with the great
and growing Sunday school forces of
the youth of our race in this country.
At Vicksburg it is estimated by the
secretary of the congress that fully
200 diplomas from the teacher-training
course, as It has been pursued this
past year, will be announced. In
March last at Nashville alone flfty-flve
graduates received their certificates
and diplomas.
In speaking of the efforts of Mr.
Boyd as secretary of the congress N.
B. Dodson, president of the New Eng
land Baptist Sunday School and B.
Y. P. U. convention, says: "The an
nouncement of the departments of the
congress does not surprise me in the
least. Henry Allen Boyd is one of the
most energetic and farseelng young
business men of our race. He knows
how to get the best results in any
movement which he leads. From a
weak and halting position nine years
ago he has infused strength and vigor
Into the membership of the Sunday
school coilgress until at the present
time its Influence is nation wide and
its work for religious education stands
without a peer in the history of Sun
day school progress among the mem
bers of our race in this country with
out regard to denomination."
Thrifty School at Manaasaa, Va.
The annual report of the Manassas
(Va.) Industrial school emphasizes the
healthy growth of the Institution along
all lines of its work and the need of
sufficient funds to meet the growing
demands for a larger and better equip
ment for industrial work. The school
was founded twenty-two years ago by
Miss Jennie Dean. The school farm
consists of 200 acres. Particular stress
is laid upon the study of agriculture
and the preparation of teachers for the
rural schools of Virginia.
Successful Work of Dr. Matilda Evans.
The St Luke hospital, Columbia, S.O.,

unique distinction and conducts the
work with signal success. She em
ploys twelve young men and women
regularly and has recently secured and

How the Sunday School Congreas
Increasing Ita Uaafulnaaa.

tion and Industry and enlarging the
sociological department the Sunday
school congress, a forward movement
that will convene in Its eleventh an
nual bosslon In Vicksburg,* Miss., from
Wednesday, June 14, to Monday, June
19, has scored another big success.
Tbe need of this new department and
the demand for the enlargement of the
second were apparent to the Sunday
school congress promoters several
years ago, but it was not until 1916
that conductors conversant with con
ditions and-capable of handling such a
department could be secured.
At the session held In Birmingham,
Ala., the sociological department scor
ed a big hit The enthusiasm that was
created in this one department was so
high that the afternoons, In which the
meetings were held, were declared too
short, the auditorium too small, and
the attendance far exceeded the ex
pectations of the officials of the con
gress.

GOOD ADVICE OF
Suooesaor of Dr. Washington at Tus

Booker T. Washington was most
persistent In his efforts that education,
whether farmer, preacher or teacher,
should be linked in a definite way to
life, and the life of tbe lowly man and
woman In particular, for he wanted to
see each man and each woman live
and do better in his daily vocation.

ABLEJDUCATOR
Major Moton Delivers Address
to Alabama Teachers.
POINTS WjlY TO SUCCESS.
Aaaoelation Held In Birmingham.
Let Us Follow Washington, He Saya.
Major Robert B. Moton of Hampton
Institute, who Is the principal elect of
Tuskegee institute and successor to
Dr. BoOker T. Washington, made Ms
first big Alabama address before the
Colored State Teachers' association,
which met In Birmingham the early
part of ApriL Some 600 white people,
Including Governor Charles Henderson,
were present
In his address Major Moton In part
said:
Booker T. Washington's educational
program was not merely local, but It
was national, worldwide in scope—in
dustry, thrift, morality, decent homes,
clean bodies and minds, better meth
ods of farming—a kind of education
which
made a universal appeal was his.
It was an education that helped farm
ers to do better farming, the carpenter
to do better carpentering and the cook
to do better cooking.
He believed that education In the
broadest sense should teach a farmer
how to get moro out of an acre by bet
ter methods that a carpenter was re
ceiving useful and very necessary in
struction when taught how to build a
better and more beautiful house at less
cost, and that to Instruct those who
cook how to keep a clean^m

less expense was, in his opinion, an
education of the most essential sort
You, no doubt, have often heard
him say that a handsome mule or
horse well groomed was fine to look at,
but that a hungry, strugging commun
ity would soon tire of looking at him
unless hitched to a plow, cart or wag
on, or unless it was doing something
that would help humanity. And, my
friends, Just so It is with education.
Wearing fine clothes and presenting
an attractive appearance does not
mean anything to a struggling and
hungry community, unless you set to
work to perform some seryice for your
fellow men.
remarkable and con­
vincing way as to command the re
spect and admiration of the entire
world.
The colored people of Alabama, as
a rule, have been wise enough to fol
low Dr. Washington's course, and as
a result the white people of the state
are growing more interested in the
Negro schools. If the white man sees
that Negro education makes a more
Industrious community, if be sees bet
ter results on his farm, In his kitchen,
better behavior ®n the streets in the
life and conduct of the colored people
of the community generally he will
not only believe In and unreservedly
approve of Negro education, but he
will find some way to assist in giving
for better schools.
White people can usually find a way
for anything they think is really worth
while, but they must be convinced that
it is so worth while, nud nobody can do
that better than the Negro teacher,
and no one demonstrated this more
conclusively, more effectively or more
beautifully than the man In whose
memory we are gathered tonight.
We as teachers must first of all live
clean, honest, industrious, unselfish
lives. We are now living in an era
when we are expected to practice what
we preach. Let us take a firm stand
for morality and set our faces like
flint against the loafing, worthless ele
ment in any race. Let us follow Dr.
Washington in teaching xhe members
of our race the necessity of decent liv
ing and the beauty and dignity of la
bor, for Indeed we have more to fear
from the lazy, shiftless, Ignorant crim
inal than from any race prejudice in
Alabama. And let us remember that
in the solution of the race problem a
large measure depends upon us, and
education will be one of our most
forceful and helpful mediums for
good.
