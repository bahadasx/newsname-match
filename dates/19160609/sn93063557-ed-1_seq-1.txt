Annlvorsnry of Middlebury Poot

Tho nnnouncemont thnt Middlebury

comtnoncomont tho onohundrodth nnnl
vorsnry of tho hlrth of John G. Snxo has
sorved to cnll nttontlon to tho poot
whoso nnmo wns onco n housohold word
In Vermont. Tho Now York Sun of
Inst Fridny snid,-
"A century ngo todny John Godfroy
Snxo wus horn nt Highgate, Vermont,
nnd though it is gcncrnlly forgottcn
thnt ho rnn twico for Govcrnor of his
nntlvo Stnto and thnt ho sought emi
nonco in tho Inw, hls poetry still en
duros, nnd somo of hls unrecordod wit
ticisms llnger in tho momory of thoso
who henrd them in the dnys of his
grentnoss nt Snratoga. Ho edlted, lec-tured-ho
flourished in tho dnys of
the Lyceum, boforo tho Chautauqua
rose to grentnoss and wrote with a
llght henrtnnd n spnrkllng mind, nnd
without olfort cultivnted tho roputn
tion of a wit. Thero is in his works n
wholesomo (piality, a sanity and a
good tomper tho studcnt of the has
reliefintho Cnpitol nt Albany would
not look for; they mny bo rend with
plensurenow, nnd a course in his writ-
ings would not bo without profit to
those who know him not."
Tho Now York Times in its issuo of
Inst Sundny also paid a tributo to Snxe,
with nn npprecintive word concerning
Middlebury College. Tho grandson to
whom the Times refers is Hon. John G.
Snxe, who has been announced to de
liver nn addrcss on the poot at the com
mencement dinner. Tho editorial is
well worth reproduction in full.
"Tho name John Godfrey Saxo, hon-
orably borne by his grandson in this
State, has a pleasunt sound nnd snvor
in mnny memories.
"Itbrings back tho scentof old pnges
of the Knickerbocker Magazino, somo
volumeof Mr. Peter Parley Goodrich's
annual 'Token' lying by its side
on the 'center table' of our
not so remote ancestors who read
Godoy's Lady's Book and Graham's
Magazine and tho Demorcrntic Review
nnd Arcturn nnd Bnllou's Drawing
Room Companion nnd the The New York
Observer, venerated Mr. Willis and
General Morris, had their backgam
mon boards solemnly bound ns 'The
Complete works of Flavius Josephus,'
Mr. Rollin's 'History' on their
sheives, ndmired 'The Lamplighter'
and 'The Lofty and tho Lowly,' and
too often swapped their fine mahog
any old furniture for funeral horse
hair nnd 'whntnots.' Age of inno
cence, in whose less innocent later
days boys and girls, shy worshippers
of Mr..Beadle, used to read Mr. Saxe's
verses in 'Readers and Speakers,'
and singsong them on 'declamation
days.'
"Mnny of those amateur reciters re
member them fondly still. They are
worth remombering. In the humorous
manner of Tom Hood, the sages tell
us. A good manner, simple, clear, ef
fective. Because Mr. Saxe had not
the scholarly, clever felicities of Cal
verley, the taking bang-and-cymbal
topsyturviness of Gilbert, shall he be
patronized by superior persons? Just
as there aro multitudos of reaction
aries who swear by humble folks like
Whittier and Longfellow, no matter
how inclustriously the Vorticists whirl
and the Imngists make faces, so divers
oldsters will continue to swear by
Saxe, a man with 'wit an' humor an'
shrewd Yankee sense, more'n there is
mossesonan old stone fence.' Some
Princoxes say he punned too much.
Habitof the time, which will recur, like
everything else, no matter how weari
some in the mouths of bunglers. One
may pun beyond forgiveness, as Henry
J. Finn did when he said:
'Ifmy punnish head were pun-i-shed
for every pun I shed, I should not
have a puny shed to hide my punnish
head.'
"This is debauchery. Saxe is a mod
erate punner. He doesn't offend. He
sharpens carelessly antithesis. He is
always neat, makes his point, gets
his laugh. He must have been a iec
turer worth hearing in the prime of
'The Lyceum.' He is often as clever
in the humorous vein ns Dr. Holmes.
But he didn'tlive in the Boston Pale,
though his works were published by
its classichouse. So he missed accel
erated and imputed fame. After he
left Vermont, he settled in Albany.
So he was not in the Knickerbocker
school, albeit his first printed verses
appeared in The Knickerbocker Mag
azine in 1841. He was isolated, with
out a claque. Mr. Stedman left him
out of Uiat exceedingly Catholic
'American Anthology.'
"The pious care of- two of Saxe's
grandchildren is to be thanked for a
charming essay in the June Bookman
