Albert Wulfcrt, Clerk.
Edward and Reichert, a copartner
ship, made application for permis
sion and franchise o erect and main
tain electric light wires across pub
lic highways, streets, etc., in the un
incorporated town of Desloge, which
was granted with the restriction that
no poles shall be erected or pipes,
mains or conduits be laid, nor wires
suspended or maintained so as to in
any manner interfere with the or
dinary traffic and use of the public
roads and highways on the county.
L. E. Halbrooks made application
to the Court for admission as a coun
ty patient to the Mount Vernon San
itarium, which was granted and a cer
tificate ordered issued admitting him
to that institution.
Bids for furnishing crushed rock
for dressing and surfacing roads
were opened and contracts were
awarded to H. C. Meyer and H. J.
Braning for the Burks road at $1.09
per cubic foot; Dock Mackley for the
St. Louis road at $1.19; DeSoto Grad
ing and Construction Co. for the Bis
marck and Frankclay road at $1.09,
and E. K. Hawn for the Jackson and
Fredericktown road cut-off at 98 l-2c.
At the written request of Dr. G. E.
Scrutchfield, Superintendent of State
Hospital No. 4, with affidavit and cer

ferring Harry Postlewaite from No.
4 to the Colony of Feeble Minded at
Marshall, Mo., as a county ward.
On Wednesday the Court, accom
panied by County Highway Engineer
Francisco, made a trip of inspection
over roads near lion Mountain, Bis
marck, Frankclay and Elvins. They
also looked over two short strips of
road, about a mile in length each,
from Bismarck to the Washington
county line, with a view of improving
one or both of them most probably
the established public road to con
nect with a road of the Caledonia
special road district in Washington
county; and also the grade of the de
funct Bismarck and Bellevue Valley
railroad, which is preferred, we be
lieve, by the Bismarck people, with
a view of making it the connecting
link. No decision, however, has been
reached as to this route, but the
Court has taken the matter under ad
visement. Fred Cantrell and Clara Ella Au
Buchon, patients at State Hospital
No. 4, were changer from private to
county patients by order of the court,
it being shown that neither of them
had sufficient estate to support them;
and warrants were issued to the Hos
pital treasurer for six monhs' support
of each.

to have four or five round trips made
between those two points daily, a dis

Mr. Steele is sanguine that the es

it would prove to be immeasurably
profitable not only to Bismarck, but
to Farmington, as well. For instance,
such service would furnish Farming

sengers to get in or out of Farming

the Illinois Southern or the Iron

A SAD DEATH
Mrs. Bessie A. Moore died Monday
morning at her home in Omaha, Neb.
Her remains were brought to Farm

by the bereaved husband, where they
were interred Wednesday afternoon,
the funeral services being conducted
by Rev. O. H. L. Cunningham, pastor

U. D. C. Commemorate Anniver
sary of Jefferson Davis' Birthday
Last Friday evening the Gantt
Chapter of the United Daughters of
the Confederacy invited a number of
friends to meet with them at the
home of the President, Mrs. G. E.
Sarutchfield, in commemoration of the
one hundred and eighth anniver
sary of the birth of Jefferson Davis,
first and only President of the Con
federate States of America. Mrs.
Benj. H. Marbury assisted Mrs.
Scrutchfield in receiving the guests.
The rooms were beautifully deco
rated with flowers and flags, "Old
Glory" dominating the whole in tes
timony of the loyalty and patriotism
of the Daughters, with here and there
a tiny mod?st flag bearing the South
ern Cross that silently whispered of
love and memory of those who with
self-approved convictiDns offered up
their lives in defense of the Lost
Cause. The exercises of the evening
consisted of instrumental music by
the Mandolin Club, old folk-iore songs
by Mrs. C. 0. Nelson, a talk on the
life of Jefferson Davis by Tdieo. D.
Fisher, and an address by Attorney
B. H. Marbury on the legal aspect of
the contention of the Southern peo
ple. Mr. Fisher gave a brief summary of
Mr. Davis' career from his birth in
Kentucky in 1808 up to the meeting
of the Congress of Southern repre
sentative men at Montgomery, Ala.,
on February 4, 1801, at which the pro
visional government of the Confeder
acy was organized and Mr. Davis and
Alexander H. Stephens were elected
President and Vice President respec
tively. He said that Mr. Davis, in re
signing his seat, in the United States
Senate on the 21st of January, 1861,

conscientious conviction that his hrst
allegiance was to his State; that the
doctrine of States' rights, including
the constitutional right of any State
to withdraw from its compact with the
Union, was held by many of the abl
est constitutional lawyers and prom
inent public men of tile country, and
up to that time the question of seces
sion had never been decidod by any
court of law; that it never has been
decided, except by the arbitrament of
flic sword. It was just a cursory look
into the life of this remarkable man,
as one glances into a lighted win
dow as he misses bv. closing with the
observation that Mr. Davis stood high

Mr. Marbury, in his address, went
into the legal and constitutional doc
trine of secession, declaring that New

for the purchase of a Victrola at the
North Ward Sc'aool, should learn of
what benefit the machine will be be

with the Radle Music Store to have a

A Snappy
England was the first to promulgate
that doctrine, and that this doctrine
originated in the Constitutional Con
vention which met in Philadelphia in
1787; that Patrick Henry refused to
support the constitution because of
the lack of the provision subsequently
adopted reserving to the States all
rights not delegated to the general
government. He declared that the
greater proportion of true and pure
American blood was and is found
South of tho Mason and Dixon line;
that Jefferson Davis was one of the
greatest and most accurate scholars,
as well as one of the greatest orators,
of the nation, and that when indicted
for treason he continuously demanded
to be fried, but that the Federal Gov
ernment would not put him on trial,
and Anally dismissed the case against
him. He declared that from a legal
and histor ical point, no Northern man
has ever successfully answered Jef
ferson Davis' book, "The Rise and
Fall of the Southern Confederacy;"
that had the South been successful,
Mr. Davis would have been ranked
with Washington, while the adminis
tration of President Lincoln would
have been counted as a failure.
There were present people of dif
ferent political views, and Mr. Mar
bury's address created some unfavora
ble comment, but he was not dealing
with present-day conditions and sen
timent, but a dead past, history which
few have searched or care to acquaint
themselves with; the legal and con
stitutional aspect of the secession
movement as it presented itself to the
people of that unfortunate and trag
ic period of our country s history.

PRACTICAL, ECONOMICAL
BUSINESS PROPOSITION
Taxpayers Can Save Money by Bond
ing the County to Build
Rock Roads
Some Bismarck people were here
Monday to see the County Court and
enlist its good offices in the matter of
improving about a mile of road from
that town to the Washington county
line where the Washington county
authorities offer to meet them with a
well improved road from Caledonia.
The members of the court took a day
off the bench Wednesday to go and
take a look at the proposed connect
ing link.
We are gradually getting good
roads in this county with macadam or
rock beds, but it has been by con
structing a little at a time each year
as the money in the county road fund
would hold out. We have some good
roads of which we are very proud,
but the process has been a slow one,
even though the county road tax of
25 cents on the $100 assessed valua
tion has been levied by the County
Court for several years past, but
there are miles and miles of public
road in the county that arc a hin
drance to any progressive community
and a hardship and expense in wear
and tear on vehicles and teams to the
people Who must use them. Some of
these roads have been gone over, we
are informed, by the County Highway
Engineer and graded with the county
grader, miles at a time. The cost of
doing this has been paid for out of
the road fund, but as the grading
could not be followed up with ma
cadam and a substantial road bed put
in, the ronds during the winter freez-
ing and thawing and the spring rains
have been washed and cut up, so that
the money expended on them Is prac
tically wasted. That is the way some
of the money that is raised by that
25 cents tax goes it is not all spent
in constructing permanent good roads.
Why continue to pursue such a
wasteful, expensive and slow policy,
when by bonding the county for from
SoOO.OOO to $500,000, we can have
good, solid road beds constructed
along every public highway in the
will increase the individual taxpayers ,
taxes, disabuse your mind of that il
lusion at once. You are now taxed
35 cents on the $100 valuation for
road purposes 25 cents for the coun
ty road fund and 10 cents for the
road district fund and it is scattered
here and there on partial stretches of
roads, without any well defined sys-
Don't Be Deceived
In an item in our last Issue, it was
intimated that Mr. Waters bought an
automobile out of funds derived from
his printing business. He informed
()f hnIIucin.ltjon , an,i to shut off the in
selling at $10 a dozen, he could not

mess, nuy a sparK plug lor a ford.
However, he says, if any unsuspect-
ing or benighted printer, still labors
I under the impression that he is get
ting rich doing printing jobs, just
come down and buy his shop and soon
reap the harvest of shekels, and he
: will try a more profitable vocation
I selling post holes, artificial eyes for
needles, etc.
Damage Suit
The suit of John Hamerosky against
the Federal Lead Company for per
sonal damage, on a change of venue
from Judge Huck, was called for
trial yesterday in the Circuit Court
of this county, with Attorney C. J.
Stanton of Ste. Genevieve on the
bench. Court sustained demurrer to
evidence and ordered a verdict for
defendant.
Miss Ruth Swink has gone to Oran
on a visit.
AT THE
8 P. M.
tern. This levy of taxes, which you
are now paying, brings in an annual
revenue of about $49,000 for road
purposes $35,000 for the county road
fund and $14,000 for the road district
funds. This would pay the annual
interest on $500,000 of bonds at 5 per
cent, which would be $25,000, and
leave $24,000 each year as a sinking
fund with which to pay off the bonds.
And you would have good, solid
roads winter, spring, summer and fall,
all over the county, at once instead of
building them a little piece at a time
over a stretch of tweny years or
more. Just think how long it has tak
en to get the comparatively few good
roads we now have. Why, can't you
see that the bonding of the county to
build roads is a practical, economical
business proposition?
But, objects some one, the County
Court would have the expending of
this money, and its members are not
practical, experienced and scientific
road builders, and the money would
be wasted and the road construction
probably prove bad and unsatisfac
tory. There is no validity to the ob
jection. The proposition, as submit
ted to the voters, can guard against
any such contingency. It can pro
vide for the employment of an ac
credited, competent highway engineer
to draw up the plans and specifica
tions and oversee the work, and n
commission of practical business and
legal men to look after the? financial
part of the scheme, to close contracts
with the contractors who undertake
the work, and inspect the work as it
progresses to see that the plans and
specifications are complied with. In
fact no proposition to bond the county
for road purposes should be voted
without provisions to secure an hon
est and faithful application of the
money.
There is really nothing in the way
except the will and purpose of the
people to act. Taxes will not be in
creased and the honest and faithful
they all favor it. Then why procras
tinate? Let's go to work and get up
petitions asking the County Court to
call a special election to submit the
proposition to the voters, and employ
a couple of good lawyers to shape the
proposition to be submitted, embrac
ing the manner in which the work
shall be done.
Evidence Too
Contradictory
The trial of Gus Sherman of Bonne
Terre, against whom an information
had been filed for "bootlegging", and
who took a change of venue from
Judge Huck, was called in the Circuit
Court in Farmington last Wednes
day, Judge E. M. Hearing of the
Twenty-first Judicial Circuit on the
bench.
It appeared from the evidence that
E. D. Rand and M. D. Adams, two
detectives from Springfield, Mo., were
employed by the. Civic League to go
to Bonne Terre and purchase liquor
from Gus Sherman. These two men
proceeded to do as directed and pur
chased four bottles of beer from
Sherman and came to Far1mgl0n' and
in- the presence of six or eight persons,
including the I'rosecuting Attorney,
stated that they had purchased these
bottles of beer from Gus Sherman.
The two detectives at the trial on
Wednesday, stated under oath, first,
on direct examination, that the pur
chase was made from Gus Sherman,
but on cross examination declared
positively that the purchase was made
from the son of Gus Sherman. This
testimony, on which the State relied
for conviction, was so contradictory
and untrustworthy that Prosecuting
Attorney Davis at once dismissed the
case.
Protect the Birds
To the Editor Farmington Times:
The Civic League was glad to see
in your issue of last Friday that you
were interested in preserving the lives
of our beautiful birds, and we wish to
join with you in creating a strong pub
lic opinion so that boys and men may
be warned against shooting them.
The boys say they are only shoot
ing the sparrows, but they are not so
expert with their guns but that they
hit robbins, wrens, red and beautiful
blue birds.
Is there not a State law that may
be enforced, if necessary?
Respectfully,
CIVIC LEAGUE.
