Minneapolis Business Men Shown
Resources During Visit Here.
GIVEN AUTOMOBILE RIDE
Visitors See Bench and Irrigated Lands
Surrounding City. Concert by
Rossiter's Band Enjoyed.
Ninety seven representative busi
ness men of Minneapolis, on their
fifth annual trade tour through the
northwestern states were given a roy
al welcome when they arrived in the
city Wednesday afternoon.
Under the direction of the Com
mercial Club, a large number of lo
cal business men and citizens met the
special, and entertained the visitors
during their visit of an hour and a
half in the city. Rossiter's Military
band of eghteen pieces accompanied
the excursionists and helped enliven
the occasion.
An address of welcome was deliver
ed by Judge L. P. Evans in behalf of
the citizens. The resorces of this
vast agricultural empire and the thrift
and progressiveness of its people were
the main topics of his talk, and the
strides Glagow, "The Golden City"
had made ince its beginning as a small
prairie town to the commanding po
sition it now holds as the commer
cial metropolis of northeastern Mon
tana were pointed out.
For the visitors, Asher Howard
responded to the address of Judge
Evans, extending the thanks of every
member of the party for the recep
tion accorded them. They had noth
ing but praise, said Mr. Howard, for
the spirit of progress and air of hos
pitality that they encountered on ev
ery hand. He explained the mission
of the tour, stating that its prime ob
ject was to bring the markets of
the northwest and the northwest and
the Twin Cities into closer touch. The
growth of this great inland empire
from the unbroken prairie to "The
Land of Plenty" during the last de
cade has turned the eyes of the na
tion on this section and the next few
years will witness even more remark
able changes.
Members of the party were then
taken for an automobile ride through
the agricultural sections surrounding
the city. The route taken showed
the visitors some of the finest farms
on the north bench and the irrigated
lands south and west of the city.
There was not one, who seeing this
part of the country for the first time,
but expressed surprise at the crops
that were raised here. They were
shown green fields of alfalfa without
irrigation on the bench and then that
grown with irrigation.
The entertainment provided during
their stay of an hour and a half and
the spirit of hospitality manifested by
the people of the city called forth
many complimentary remarks from
the tourists. They were unanimous
in stating that the reception accord
ed them at Glasgow was the best they
had met with since leaving Minne
apolis, and the enterprise shown by
the citizens reflected the spirit of the
city.
There were ninety seven of the Mill
City's leading business men on the
train, representing practically every
Excellent Prises Offered for
Corn Exhibits at County Fair
Corn growing in Valley County
will receive more than usual atten
tion during the summer if the inter
est taken by Glasgow business men is
equaled by the f armers. Many spe
cial cash premiums have been offer
ed for corn besides the regular prizes
that will be awarded by the Valley
County Fair Association.
That each kind of corn will re
ceive proper consideration, the First
National Bank will give ten dollars
in gold for each best ten ears of
Northwest Dent, White Dent and
Flint corn. The Glasgow National

on which they were traveling is com
posed of four standard sleeping cars,
two full compartment sleeping cars,
one open parlor car, one parlor ob
servation car, two dinning cars, one
railroad private car and one baggage
car. The tour is being made through

party expect to make 46 stops en

MEAT NOW ADMITTED
UNDER PARCEL POST
New Ruling of Postoffice Will Benefit
Hunters in Shipping Game.
Meat and meat products are admit
ted to the parcels post service by an
order received at the local postoffice
îecently. Heretofore these commo
dities were denied the use of the ser
vice. The new regulation only re
quires that the department of agri
culture rules be complied wflth by
shippers and asks the postal officials
not to accept meat in any form which
in tl#i ordinary course of the pro
gress of mail would spoil in transit.
This feature of the parcels post
will be a great aid to hunters and
sportsmen, in the estimation of local
huntsmen. The new provision may
call for some state action, asking co
operation between the office of the
game warden and the postoffice au
thorities to prevent violation of the
provision of the Montana law, which
prohibits shipping game killed in
j Montana out of the state without spe
I cial permits, however.
The amendment to the parcels post
I act which permits the shipping of
I meat is as follows:
i Fresh, salted, dried, smoked or
cured meats and other meat products
may be admitted to the mails and may
be transported regardless of distance,
from one state or territory or the Dis
trict of Columbia to another state or
j territory, provided the regulations
promulgated thereunder by the de
j partment of agriculture have been
J complied with. Provided, however,
that fresh meats in any form shall be
: accepted for mailing only to post
Affices to which in the ordinary course
of mail it can be sent without spoiling.

AUTO KILLS POPLAR BOY
The eight year old son of Mr. and
Mrs. Boyce of Poplar was killed in
an auto accident last Saturday morn
ing, being struck and run oyer by a
car driven by Mrs. Joe Bauer, says
the Brockton Bulletin. It seems that
the boy was running across the street
and either became confused and
stopped or stumbled and fell as the
car approached. He was struck by
the front wheels, and the rear wheels
passed over his body, killing him in
stantly. Eyewitnesses claim that it
was purely accidental.
CIRCUS COMING JULY 6th
Gollmar Bros, circus will exhibit in
the city on Thursday, July 6th. This
company has adde< r many new acts
and attractions to their outfit and will,
be well worth going to see.
St. Matthews' Episcopal church on
Whit-Sunday. Morning prayer at 11
Continuing their previous efforts of
developing the seed corn growing in
Valley County, the Coleman Hart?
ware Co., will make a special prem
ium offer for fifty ears of corn of a
pair of $15.00 horse collars.
For the boys and girls there are
three special prizes, all of which are
well worth trying for. The Glas
gow Courier will play the expense to
the State Fair at Helena of the win
ner of first for the best ten ears of
corn. The Valley County News will
give a second prize of Ten Dollars and
a third prize of Five Dollars. A
written description of the method of
seeding and growing the corn is to
accompany these entries.
Here is another opportunity for
Valley County to win at the State Fair
in the corn division as has been done
the two previous years. Every far
mer should make a special effort to
help maintain this county as the King
Corn County of Montana.

For many years Mr. Walker had
been in the restaurant business in the

CHINAMAN COMMITS
SUICIDE ON TRAIN
Oriental Being Deported Stranglea
Himself in Berth.
Strangling himself with his hand
kerchief while lying in his berth on
Great Northern train No. 1, Monday
morn ng, Sam Sing, a Chinaman, be
ing deportee, took his iwn life.
With two other Chinese and one
Filipino, Sing was being taken from
Matteawan State Hospital in New
York, being mentally unfit. They were
in charge of Dr. George A. Sharp of
the New York State Hospital, Dr.
Walter King of Gowanda State Hos
pital, and Leon Feldman, Interpreter
and transportation agent.
According to Dr. Sharp, Sing had
risen for a drink of water early in
the morning, and when called for
breakfast a half hour later, they found
him dead. The train was between
Williston and Culbertson when the dis
covery was made, and Coroner Peter
son at Glasgow was telegraphed to
meet the train and take charge of
the body.
It was very apparent that death
was due to strangulation and that Sing
had died by his own hand, and after
hearing the evidence of those in the
car, the Coroner decided that no in
quest was necessary and the funeral
took place the same day.
So far as could be learned the dead
Chinaman had no relatives, and his
fortune totaled $10, which went
towards paying the funeral expenses.
ENGINE PLUNGES INTO RIVER
The Great Northern passenger en

flood waters of the river. Two mail
clerks were bruised but none of the
passengers were injured. The bag
gage car and mail car left the track
but did not turn over or fall into
he river.
TRYING NORVAL CASE

Dr. Smith returned this morning from I
Glendive and states that the testi- !

case is now in th 1 hands of the I
jury.
Bills Introduced in Congress
to Stop Settling on State Land
Of vital interest to the hundreds
of people who filed on the state land
in northern Valley and Sheridan coun
ties a short time ago, is the announce
ment made recently in the Helena
papers that bills were now pending
in congress to remedy any defect in
the law, whereby these settlers could
gain a right to the land.
If the state's selections are invalid,
and the entries are allowed, it will
mean much to Valley and Sheridan
counties. The state lands are among
the best in this section, and if the
settlers are allowed to go upon it,
hundreds of valuable farms will be
added to the value of property in the
counties. However the state is go
ing to fight to hold the land and i3
endeavoring to get legislation passed
to give them clear title.
Secretary of State A. M. Alderson
and a member of the state land board

One Sided Game Results in Glas

HEAVY HITTING A FEATURE
Locals Get Twelve Safe Blows. Spauld

teen. Janes, Culbertson Star.
But a few years ago, the very men
tion of a ball team from Culbertson
was enough to oast a shadow of gloom
over the rosy hope? of victory of any
Gla«gow base ball fan, but the team
that represented the town from down
the line in the game here Sunday
proved "easy pickings" for the local
nine.
To the disappointment of no ümall
number of fans, Ike Slette, the dd
stand-by of the Culbertson team did
not pitch, but Hustead, imported from
Sidney for the occasion, served them
over the plate to the liking of the
Glasgow batters. He displayed rare
judgment at times when he allowed
the batter to get a base on balls, for
in all probability, the ball would have
been smitten, and the tired fielders
would have been exhausted.

HAVRE TEACHER DIES
Miss Bessie Mackenzie, one of
Havre's most beloved young women,
died at her home in that city Mon
day morning, after a brief illness,
due to rheumatic fever. She had
been the preceptoress of the Devlin
school for several years. Her death
will be a big loss to the community
as her interests extended in many
noble directions. The funeral was
held on Tuesday afternoon, Rev. L.
J. Christler officiating. Burial will
be made at her old home in Wabasha,
connection with the. patenting of the
state lands. Under the various
grants to the state by the govern
ment, it has been necessary to select
lieu lands, the aggregate of these
now being 601,000 acres. The Hel
ena papers state that while the law
is perfectly plain on the subject, nev
ertheless representatives in congress
of the land grant states have deter
mined that to make the situation per
fectly clear it would be well to have
additional legislation. In consequence
two bills heve been introduced, one in
the senate and one in the house. They
are identical and provide in substance
that the title of the state to the lieu
lands attaches at the time of selection
by the commonwealth. Senator My
ers is working earnestly to have the
bill pass in the senate. Both bills
have been reported favorably from
the committees, and an effort is be
ing made to have either one of the
two bills become a law.
