VILLAGE THUSTKKS MEET
At the meeting of the Village
Hoard of TusteeB Wednesday even
ing meant) of raiding funds for the
purpose of equipping the new city
well were discussed. There is not
funds in the treasury at present to
eipjip the well, but an urdlnance
will be passed at a special meet
ing next Tuesday evening which
will provide for the deficiency. A
large tank will be put up and h
main will be laid to the old well
so that it can be connected up with
the other pipes.
The current bills were allowed
and the clerk Instructed to draw
warrants for the same. Several
matters were taken up, hut were
left on the table until the next
meeting.
Mrs. Hoppe to Entertain Ladies
Mrs Hoppe Invited the indies
Aid of Columl ns to a picnic box
lunch at her home Juno liNt.
Tills Is the longest day in the
vear but those who have had the
pleasure of a day with this
charming hostess are convinced
that this Wednesday June I' 1st
will be a very short day. Ladies
and escorts urn making it n has-
bet luncheon and it is suggested
that tisliing tackle be carried It
is declared there is no such tiling
in Columbus but this up to the-
minute burgh will probably
sleek up on lish hooks before the
the picnic as most of us eat
"gold tlsli," there is more need
for a can opener than a hock in
tne usual order of things, but
this town and its people strive to
till all needs so it is probable
that, to the numerous "goggle"
signs the citizens will soon see
added "Kish hooks and lines sold
hoi e."
cuts, bad supposed that lie was
to represent Johnson, but after
the court had made the decision
Johnson stated that he had not
employed the lawyer anil that he
wanted a new trial so that he
could put up some defence.
Under tho circumstances he was
allowed another trial and he
went out and got his witnesses
and ho wasuctiuitted.
The prosecution of the viola
tors of the law at Columbus has
been costing the county at least
$50 per day for the past two
weeks and the district attorneys,
as well as tho district judge,
says that it lias got to stop. The
bonds have seemed rather high,
but some of the guilty ones will
be put where they will not com
mit uuy offense again soon on
this account.
The people of Columbus are
law-abiding, and those who have
come in with tho tide since the
raid and tried to sell booze do
not have the sympathy of the
people. This was plainly shown
in the vote for seorllT at tho
primury Tuesday. Sheriff Simp
son is doing everything .in his
newer to stamp it out, and tho
people r.ould not turn him down
with his work this well uhder
way.
TRINITY MEMORIAL
The Woman's Guild of Trinilj
Mission met at the home of Mrs.
J. Anderson, Thursday ufternoos,
to discuss plans for the erection
of a parish house. During the re
cent visit of Rt. Rev. F. B. How-den-
D. D., Rlshop of New Mexico,
the reverend gontleman gave the
parish a hundred dollars to add to
the building fund.
The Parish owns four lots on
which it was intended' to build-
but as they are in the parish of the
existing church it Is thought wiser
to buy in a more distant part of
town. Many members of this par
ish who are holding services ev
ery Sunday, by courtesy, at the
Cystal theater, under the guidance
of Ci.i'plain Z. T. Vincent of the
National Guard, hope this mission
will be called Trinity Mission in
honor of the soldiers of the United
States army who died In the raid o
sinco the punitivo expedition won
into Mexico. This will in no way
conflict with the bigger memorinl
for the victims of the Villa tra
gedy, but will simply bo a tribute
to all soldiers tendered by this
parish, which hopes to be a powoi
for good to the soldiers of this
base. At each sevlec held at the
Cystal special prayer for sick and
dying soldiers is offered.
Party at Home of Mrs. Anderson
There will be an open air
moonlight entertninmi nt given
by the Womnn's Cniild of tin
Trinity Mission at Mrs J. S
Ander'son's home Juii" llitli at
7:110. Refreshments and i pro
gram will add to the pleasure of
all who attend
It is hoped that there will be a
big crowd of citizens and sol
dlersalso. Mem hern of the Guild
include Mir Anderson, Mrs.
Imiiiiih Nelson. Mrs. J. l White,
Sirs (i O'U'C Peters and M'S
William Anderson.
VILLA RAH) MEMORIAL
Among the ladies present at the
big meeting of the Ladies' Aid last
Wednesday at Mrs. Taylor's were
Vice-President in the chair, Mrs.
G. T. Peters, Secretary Mrs. A. L.
Taylor Treasurer L. J. Peach ;

After the regular meeting of the

was granted the chair for a
few minutes appeal for interest on
the part of the ladies, in tho pro
posed Villa Raid Memorial, not
only of the indies present, but of
their activo co-operation in bring
ing the matter before the men of
the families and their friends. It
is hoped that probably by Sunday
next a mass meeting of oil inter
ested in this movement, and this
should indued everyone at this
place- and can bo called at the
Crystal theater, to begin work on
Ihe big idea. Mr. Greenwood has
ponsented to ac ont a committee,
jis well as lend the use of the hea
ter, it is hoped the mayor will be
represented and many other prom
inent men of money and brains to
work for this propscd memorial,,
which, if it takes the form of a
park- will also add comfort and
beauty to the town, and keep in
memory those who died so tragi
cally. COLUMBUS,

FLAG DAY SERVICE
By courtesy of Major W. R. Sample-
in command of this army base,
the Rt. Rev. F. B. Howden, D. D.,
will come to Columbus to conduct
n Flag Day celebration on Wed
nesday, June 14. This celebration
.will be patriotic rather than reli
gious, and it is hoped everyone,
big and little, will join in this
event. It is probable this will he
a field day affair- and near th
band stand will be the point of
celebration, if tho service is call,
ed for 0:30 p. m., later than that,
it is likely the Y. M. C. A. hall
will be used for the ceremony, but
notice will be pomed in the waiting
room of the station- by courtesy of
the Southwestern Railroad, as to
hour and place.
There will be a religious ser
vice during the visit of the bishop
of New Mexico, at which time the
rites of confirmation will be ad
ministered to several persons who
thus desiro to be enlisted in the
church army, in tho ever present
fight of all Christians against the
power of evil.
There is a littlo child dear to
tho hearts of a!! Columbus people
ftnd now of national importance,
the little daughter of the heroic
switchboard operator who called
for help during the raid, when all
others were terrified by the in
vasion of the bandit forces.
This little lady is so much a
part of the present Mexican situa
tion that it is rercquested that her
.christening, the official giving of
fi name that will live in the his
.tory of this town- be given bv the
Bishop of New Mexico, as part of
the Flag Day sen-Ice. This will
probably bo as popular an idea
-ith th -"'dlcrs w- the - -nt
christening of Douglas Schley
Frost, who, in the presence of al
most the entire camp, was so re
cently given his illustrious name.
Special to the Courier by Jean
Cabell O'Neill. '
Y. 31. C. A. BUILDING OPEN
The Y. M. C. Associotion Hall
holding regular services and is
open for the comfort of the men
in camp. The wind has been very
unkind, but even a seventy mile

Chaplain James Hillman and Mr.
J3oddincton.
Very soon it is believed the win
dows will be in, and the strips on
.the building, then it will be wind
proof, and sand tight, and Mr.
Nye, tho general superintendent,
will be able to carry out the plans
he has mad for the pleasure and
profit of all.

TIIE RECENT HOUTS AT
TIIE AIIIDOME THEATKIt
There have been fewer livelier
events pulled off at Columbus
since it began to adorn the map of
the United Stnte, than the rc- i
bouts at the Airdome, when the
13th cavalry was pitted, in two ' ''
its members of the sporting woi.d
against Jack Uempsey of El P; ,
"Standing room only was at a
premium u:.d the enthusiasm of
the audience matched its numbers.
There was clean and lively work
on the part of the fighters, nm
there was some dirty and brutal
work also on the part of one of ihe
contestants, but on the whole the
good outshone the bad, so the c. en
itig of thrills was a big success.
The first bout, as is rcmembeie-l.
was u six round affair and Dutch
Crozier of the Militia won by a
large margin, much to the delight
of his sponsors among the members
of the National Guards. Rut tho
Crozier won, it is only fair to say
that "Battling Wolf" put up a
pretty plucky fight, and next time
luck may be kinder to him.
Tho second bout was "short und
sweet," one round and "all was
qver but the shouting." Al McCar
ty of the 13th went down under a
fierce and swift hook to the jaw,
taking the count. His antagonist.
Jck Arnold, of Deming, came with
a, rePuttion f being an nggres-
've fighter, and he certainly moas-
"red up to this standard. Al was

The great event of the evening,
for which all waited eagerly, even
through the interest of the open
ing events, was the setto between
Young Allen and Jack Dempscy.
