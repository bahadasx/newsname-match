PRESERVING- EGGS.
I .. (Part 2)
Water lasa is a heavy or
thick straw-colored liquid, and
may be purchased at a reaaon
9A$ price from any druggid.
Many, factors enter into the
price demanded. Quality, quan
tity, and the degree of desire
the merchant has to become
wealthy are the three governing
factors. In barrel lots it may
be purchased at from 20 to 30
euts a gallon. In five-gallon
cans it should cost from 45 to 70
cents a gallon. By the gallon it
maj cost aa high as two dollars.
There is much water rlass on
tba market that is not good.
Good water glass is but slightly
alkaline, while poor water elass
contains an excessive amount
of alkali, which deteriorates the
hell of the eggs to a point
where it is likely to break in the
jar. To overcome the' excess of
alkali, from a toaspoonful to a
tablespoon full of vinegar should
be added to a gallon of the
watr glass. In making the
preserving solution from 10 to
12 parts of water that has been
boiles and cooled should be used
t one part of water fllass.
For a receptacle in which to
pack the eggs, nothing better
tfon ail ordinary three or five
allaa stone crock can be used,
however, wooden buckets or
kega may be used with entire
satisfaction. The vessel should
be thoroughly ecuMod and plac
ed in the position in which it is
to remain before, the eggs are
put in it. The eggs should be
stored in a moderately cool,
well ventilated cellar or room.
The ideal egg for preserving,
besides being infertile, .should
.be naturally clean and not wash
ed clean, free from checks arid
not over seven days old. The
eggs should be carefully packed
in the Jar- until it is filled to
within an inch or an inch and a
half of the tops - The solution
is then poured over tho eggs till
they are completely covered.
Place a cloth cover and then
the lid of the vessel over them.
From time to time look at the
eggs to see that the liquid lias
not evaporated and allowed the
top eggs to become exposed to
the air. Should such an occur
rence happen, pour enough boil
ed and cooled water into the
jar to completely cover th
eggs.
In general this completes the
operation. However, there are
a few points to which attention
should be called. A White" pre
cipitate, whit;h is silicic acid,
forms in tho jar. This is a pois
onous substance, but there is
absolutely no danger from it if
all eggs are washed before us
ing. To boil water glass eggs,
a pin hole should be made in
the large od of the egg, to allow
for expansion of air. Normally
the shell of an egg is porous,
but when preserved in water
glass it is sealed with a thin
coating of glapw, which is iden
tical With window glass and
which makes it rtecessai" to
make an escape for the air when
boiliag the egg. The hands
should be kept out of the solu
tion, as it will make them rough
and eore. One cracked or check
el egg will flavor the entire lot.
An egg that has started to spoil
will continue to spoil if put in
the preservative. It is not nec
essary io put all the eggs in the
preservative on the 6ame day.
borne may be put in one day and
covered and others added as
they are obtained. Eggs that
have been preserved ir watei
glass are desirable for all pur
poses up to eight or ten months
of preservation, after which the
albumem becomes thin and they
are not entirely satisfactory to

souvi, southern Iowa an,l parts
of Kansas could use small bun
ches of cattle, receipts suitable
for this purpose aro limited, so
trade in Blockers and feetlers
this week was litjlit. High pri
ces again prevail on choice light
stockers- sales reaching $9.
Other sales of steers averaging
750 lbs. were made at $8.50.
The demand was largely for the
latter class of cattle which were
scarce. The transactions also
include a number of stock cows
and heifers.
Kansas City, June 3. Sharp
ly advancing prices after the
opening weakness on Monday,
following the good gains made
in beef steers last week, in spite
of the fact that matured beeves
arm o-rnwini' scarcer every day
There was an increase of 0,000
over last week and a gain of
10,000 over last year. Choice
to prime finished steers were
scarce and continued to advance,
reaching the highest level ever
l-nrnvn at this season of the
year.
faces. Jie took her arm and together
they fought their way across the plat- .
form through the storm. Then they,
stopped suddenly, aghast. The track
was. empty and the train gone! It had
slipped away, its noise drowned by:
the screaming wind.
"By Georgv that's too bad!" h
shouted into her ear. Marian was
thcnkful now for the storm "aud dark
ness, for she could not keep back, the
tenrs any longer.
Ther'j seemed to be nothing to do
but to go back to tho empty station,
which ofiorcd protection at least from
tho storm. She might have to wait
some tluio for the next train.
.. As they wont into the little waiting
room for the second time the fumes
of tobacco notified the travelers that
tho agent had come in, evidently by
some other way.
"Hello, Bob!' Where on earth have
you been?" askd Marian's would-be
benefactor, "While we were waiting
for you to hunt us a bite to eat, the
train vamoosed and Iptt us."
Marian heard the other man whistle
with surprise. "Then I am afraid you .
are up against it, Mr. Hays. There
isn't another train tonight!"
Marian "dropped limply to a seat.
The man went to the door and stepped
outside to toll his idea of the whole
business to the elements. i
In a few minutes he burst into the
waiting room. "Say, Bob, there's a
gasoline work car down the track!
Is she all right?"
"1 guess so. The men left her there
on the siding. Why, what were you
thinking cf? It's frozen over like a
wedding cake."
"I was thinking," said the man,
that as I know enough about them
to run cne, we might thaw off the
icing with hot water and I could get
this young lady to Drexel in time to
catch the express. Any gasoline -around
the place, do you suppose?"
"Why, there's a bar'I of gasolin
back of the freight house. Been there
all winter. But, say, there's lOU of
freight trains. You'd get killed."
"No, we won't!"
By the time the little car was ready
the wind had calmed, and Marian,
wrapped to her ears in a borrowed
robe, sat like a queen on the soap box
the men had found for her. In a min
ute they were sliding along Into the
darkness, their lanterns illuminating
the rails only a couple of feet ahead.
Marian was frightened, but gVv no
sign. She would have risked hey life
on a war balloon to get to Brighton
before twelve.
The car sped on past little stations
that were as quiet as cemeteries. No
freights overtook them, and at last
the lights of Drxel appeared.
The man held his watch close to
the lantern. "Good!" he cried. "Ten
minutes and we'll be on the express
to Brighton."
There had been little opportunity
tor conversation. In the waiting room
at Drexel Marian tried to thank him.
There were still two minutes befor
the train was due.
"I wonder if you know bow much I
appreciate what you have done for
me, Mr. "
"Hays! Endicott Hays!" i
'Mr. Hays! My name is Marian
Langley, and it is absolutely neces
sary for me to be in Brighton today,
it seems that all the heirs to the Lang
ley estate are in danger of losing a
great deal of money if I don't have my
name on some stupid paper or other
before midnight."
Endicott Hays looked at her in as
tehibhnient for an instant. Then, draw
ing a paper frournls pocket, be cried:
"And this is the stupid paper. I was
going to Brighton to find you. I'm the
lawyer in the case. They told me you.
lived there!"
"And after they had discovered their
mistake, they telegraphed me to meet
you there, as you had already depart
ed," laugh'ed Marian, "Isn't Jt too
funny?"
The man's answer was drowned in
the noise of the express as it thun
dered in. But bis look held inquiry.
"I'd better get on anyway and go
to Aunt Martha's for the night," said
Marian.
"And I'd better go to Brighton, too,
so I can come around in the morning
and be properly Introduced. May I?"
"Perfectly splendid," agreed Marian,
aslhey boarded the train for the re
mainder of the trip.
