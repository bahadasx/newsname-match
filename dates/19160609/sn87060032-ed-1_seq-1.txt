SAMPSON SENTIMENT
V -. ...
A6 .Expressed in the Newspapers of the Seventh
Appellate District Editorial Remarks Taken
From a Few of the Leading Republi
can Papers.
East Kentucky News, Whites
burg, March 3, 1916.
Judge Sampson is a native of
Knox county, just about forty
years of age with a wealth of
physical strength and mentality,
which promises a long, useful
and honorable life; his father,
Joseph Sampson, having attain
ed a high place in longevity;
ninety-two years of age, having
voted seventy-one years; and
since the rise of the Republican
party has voted that ticket with
out a "scratch" and looks for
ward to the coming election with
a lively interest.
It is inferred that the son had
emulated the example of his
father in his adherence and de
votion to the Republican princi
ples. Judge Sampson, who has
never suffered defeat, has the
credit generally of leading his
" ticket. Judge Sampson gradut
ed with honors from the law de
partment of the University of
Indiana, a state where political
phenomena and intellectual ac
tivity ranks well with Kentucky;
but he practiced law successfully
for ten years before he entered
the political domain, and only
then at the earnest solicitation
of his friends and associates.
His decision as Circuit Judge
have been conceded as having a
marked degree of fairness, and
according to the number of cases
he has tried he has seldom been
reversed by the higher courts.
A Good Man and
Staunch Repulican
Pineville Citizen
Judge Sampson served as
Judge of Knox County for sever
al years and has twice been elec
ted Judge of the 34th Judicial
district,- the last time receiving
his election without opposition.
He is a staunch Republican, a
good man and well qualified for
the place he seeks. His past re
cord entitles him to the consider
ation of the votes of his district.
Faithful and Efficient
Paintsville Post
Judge Sampson lives at Bar-
bourville, Ky., and his neighbors
highly recommend him. He is
only 41 years of age and has
served one term as County Judge
of his county. One term as Cir
cuit Judge in the 34th Judicial
district and is now beginning the
second term as Circuit Judge,
He had no opposition either for
the nomination or election when
he was re-elected. This speaks
well for him and proves to those
who are not personally acquaint
ed with him that he is a faithful
and efficient officer.
A Friend of theLaboring People
Has Lead for Nomination
Harlan Messenger, March 29.
Judge F. D. Sampson, of Bar
bourville, was here today, Wed
nesday, in the interest of his
candidacy for Judge of the Sev
enth Appellate District of Ken
tucky. Judge, Sampson comes
highly recommended and it
would seem that he has the lead
for the nomination.
Will Add Distinction
to Our Highest Courts
Pinnacle News, Middleboro,
April 6, 1916
We are announcing this week
Judge Flem D. Sampson, of Bar
bourville, Ky., for Appellate
Judge, and are publishing in this
issue articles of reading matter
pertaining to him officially. In
our opinion, none of these notices
give to Judge Sampson a suffi
ciency of the commendation he
deserves. Before the Judge be
came an aspirant for judicial
promotion we were prompted
from a sense of appreciation of
his lofty purposes and acts as
Judge of his court, to make nott
of his splendid work. We felt it
our duty to credit him with a de
sire to arise above ike common
place, to' make notable the law
and the dignity of his position:
to do in the full those acts of
duty which would justify the
saying, nowhere in the State Is
there a better judge.
He seemingly at all times, had
in mind two worthy thoughts, the
one to live up to the highest pur-
