Driggett-Thorne Nuptials
A pretty wedding was solemnized
at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Gardner
Thorne, Thursday, June 1st, when
their daughter, Cleo, became the wife
of William Driggett. The ceremoney
was performed by Rev. Quinton alk
er, pastor of the Methodist Church at
Charlevoix, in the presence of a num
ber of guests, the ring service being
used.
The bride was prettily gowned in
white satin and earned bridal roses.
Miss Lillian Thorne, sister of the bride,
and Miss Gladys Vanderventer, cousin
of the bride acted as bridesmaids, be
ing gowned in pink silk and carried
pink and white carnations. The bride
groom wore the conventional black
and was attended by his brother,
George Driggett. The wedding march
was played by Anna Driggett, sister of
the groom and Miss Mildred Eckinger
of Charlevoix sang sweetly, "Let Me
Sing To You." Mr. and Mrs. Driggett
left Saturday for Detroit where they
will make their future home. The out
of town guests were Miss Alice Hale of
Detroit cousin of Mr. Driggett, Mr. and
Mrs. S. Vanderventer and daughter
Gladys, of Cadillac, brother and sister
of Mr. and Mrs. Thorne and Mr. and
Mrs. Cornwell of Ellsworth.
Fallis-Rowman Nuptials
Two former East Jordan people were
united in marriage at Ontario, Cal., on
May lGth. Below is an account of the
wedding from a newspaper of that
city:
A very pretty but quiet wedding wit
nessed by only the immediate families
and relatives, was that of John A. Fallis
and Miss Margaret K. Bowman at
Bethel Congregational Church last eve
ning at seven o'clock.
Fallis is a brother of W. B. and F. G.
Fallis of Fallis Brothers, and has a
large circle of friends in business and
social enters. Miss Bowman is a daugh
ter of Mrs. Eliza Bowman of Detroit
but formerly of East Jordan, Mich.,
where the Bowman and Fallis families
were well acquainted.
The wedding ceremony was perform
ed by Rev. Ralph B. Larkin, pastor of
Bethel Church. After the ceremony
the entire wedding party motored to
Kiverside, where a wedding supper
was served at the Glenwood Mission
Inn. Mr. and Mrs. Fallis will spend
their honeymoon in Riverside, San
Diego and other coast cities. They
will make their home in Ontario, and
will be at home here after Sept 1st.
Silence is golden, except when a
counterfeit.
The mind cure may be all right but
the patient must have a mind of his
own to start with.
Lots of men are lenient with them
selves because of their .belief that
charity begins at home.
Beauty is said to be only skin deep,
but many a woman's beauty depends
upon the size of her balance in the
bank.
Fearing to break into a profession
that's overcrowded, some men waste
the best years of their lives.looking for
one that isn't.
It is much easier for a bad man to live
down to his reputation than it is for a
good man to live up to his as well as
more usual.

ALONG THE FIRING LINE
W. J. Bryan may gain a reputation
for humor, but he is likely to lose a
reputation for candor, if he continues
to deal with export statistics. In the
last issue of his Commoner, in a column
headed. "Funny Things," he gives
several items of exports and says that
'most of the increases were in exports
to countries not at war and to markets
once controlled by the present bellig
erents." If this was intended to con
vey the impression that our unprece
dented increase in export trade is not
due to the war, it far wide of the
truth, and every man and woman in
the United States knows it. The
farmers of Nebraska know who has
been buying their wheat, their horses
and their cattle. The woolen mills of
the East know who ordered the hun
dreds of thousands of yards of kahki
cloth for soldiers' uniforms. The men
who work in powder and shell factories
arc not deceived as to the destination
of their product. Even members of
the present administration have warn
ed American business men that they
cannot hope for a continuance of this
abnormal market after the war has
closed. But Mr. Bryan must not think
that putting the figures in the column
of "Funny Things", excuses his pal
pable misrepresentation.
There were two members of the New
Jersey delegation who desired the
honor of placing the name of Woodrow
Wilson before the St. Louis convention
and the President was forced to choose
between them. It does not seem to
have occurred to him to compromise
the matter by selecting the man from
Nebraska who three times polled more
votes for President than did Wilson
himself.
Sometimes it is useful to get a man's
measure as given by his friends. Speak
ing of Democratic Senators and Con
gressmen who are just now standing
with the President upon certain issues,
though they differed from him on other
issues last year. Mr. Bryan says that
they "want to be re-elected and re
gard Wilson's coat-tails as a very handy
thing to grab hold of this year."
Presumably, Mr. Bryan wants these
men elected, for they are good Demo
crats, but it won't help them much at
home to have him place this estimate
upon them. Every Democratic Senator
and Congressman who tries to drag in
on the Wilson coat-tails will very likely
have this remark of Bryan's thrown at
him in the campaign.
If President Wilson has been labor
ing under the delusion that Bryan is
his political friend, he will be unde
ceived when he reads in the Commoner
the article over Bryan's signature
calling attention to the fact that in the
Nebraska primaries 9,417 Democrats
voted for a liveryman for delegate to
the National Convention, knowing that
the man was a pronounced opponent
of Wilson. The vote polled by this op
ponent of Wilson was about 15 percent
of the Wilson vote. In Nebraska, in
1912, Wilson polled 109,000 votes,
against 120,000 for Taft and Roosevelt.
With a re-united Republican party and
an indicated defection of 15 per cent in
the Democratic party, what hope is
there for Wilson to carry Nebraska this
year?

Paul M. Warburg, head of the Feder
al Reserve System, is trying hard to
bolster up the Democratic campaign,
but he is so far wrong on some of His
facts that he will soon be discredited.
In a speech before the Economic Club,
of New York, recently, he said that
"the United States, in the beginning of
1914 was moving toward the position of
an industrial and financial world
power." Figures of the Department
of Commerce show that in October,
1913, we had a balance of trade in our
favor to the amount of $138,000,000.
The monthly balance steadily diminish
ed until in April, 1914, the balance was
against us and in August, 1914, the
balance against us was $19,000,000.
War orders turned the tide in our
favor. How do you explain yourself,
Mr. Warbi'rg?
DISPLAY FLAGS
On June 14 will occur Flag Day, and
it is hoped that the people will pay
more attention to the proper observ
ance of this event. There is little use
made of the United States flag, for no
other reason than that the people for
get that they owe the nation a debt of
gratitude that they can never repay.
It is time that this forgetfulness should
be eliminated and that due attention be
paid to a display of the national colors
upon appropriate occasions. The more
the flag is displayed the more people
will turn their attention toward patriotic
thought and action. The United States
flag is the result of all United States
history, and within its folds is contain
ed not only the history of the nation,
but its destiny as well. The flag is the
constant reminder of the sacrifices that
were made by the fathers in order that
their ideal of a free government might
be realized, and for this reason it is
imperative that every attention be paid
to the national emblem which means so
much to the future generations. When
Flag Day comes everybody should dis
play the national colors in the most
conspicuous way possible, for by so
doing the people will be reminded of
their obligations as citizens and their
duties as patriots. Never forget the
flag, for it is the constant reminder of
the source of the nation and a call to
duty of the present. People should
show their colors and thereby prove
to the world that commercialism has
not yet succeeded in dulling the
patriotic instincts of the nation.

HOW TO PREVENT FIRES.
It is an old maxim that fire is a good
servant but a hard master.
Shakespeare wrote: "A little fire is
quickly trodden out; which, being
suffered, rivers cannot quench."
Fires are the result of accident, of
spontaneous combustion, and of design.
If they have been accidental the cause
can generally be discovered, and it will
be found they might have been pre
vented. If the following precautions are taken
fires from accident or spontaneous com
bustion will seldom occur: I
Keep your house, store, or factory
clean.
Never allow rubbish, such as paper,
rags, cobwebs, old clothing, boxes, etc.
to accumulate in closets and unused
rooms.
Never fill your coal oil lamps after
dark or near an open fire.
Never run your stove pipes through
a wooden partition or-through the roof
without proper protection.
Never allow your furnace, steam or
hot water pipes to come in contact with
wood.
Never put up gas brackets so they
can be swung against the wooden
window casings or against, or im
mediately under curtains.
Never put ashes in a wooden re
ceptacle in or about your premises.
Never keep matches in any but
metal or earthen safes, and when you
light one never throw it on the floor.
Never allow smoking in proximity to
inflammable merchandise or materials.
Never take an open light to examine
a gas meter or into a closet.
Never read in bed by candle or lamp
light.
Never close up your place of business
before going over the entire premises
to see that all fires and light are safe
or extinguished.
Never forget that carelessness and
negligence are the cause of over two
thirds of all fires.
Never forget to have pails or buckets
and water near at hand for immediate
use in case bi emergency.
Familiarize yourself with the location
of windows and natural escape.
Learn the position of all stairways,
particularly the top landing and scuttle
to the roof.
Keep the doors of rooms shut.
Open windows from the top.
Wet a towel, stuff it in the mouth,
breath through it instead of nose, so as
not to inhale smoke.
If room fills with smoke keep close to
floor and crawl along by the walls to
the window.
Never go to the roof, unless as a last
resort and you know there is escape to
adjoining buildings.
Never jump through flames in
building without covering the head
with a blanket or heavy clothing.
Never get excited, try to recall the
means of exit.
Some men learn by doing and some
learn by being done.
A man with a grouch never misses
an opportunity to advertise it.

HEARD AT TOE
NATIONAL CAPITAL
Washington, June 7, Special Cor
respondence. "In the first year of
lis administration, President Wilson
made a great hulabaloo about the
'lobby." He stated at that time that
he would drive every lobbyist out of
Washington and would have nobody
interfering with legislation in this
country and that he wanted to have a
free hand," said a prominent United
States Senator. "During this present
session of Congress we have witnessed
on various occasions more lobbying by
cabinet officers and men close to the
President, than in any administration
n the history of the government.
There has never been a time when
there was so much attempted execu
tive interference with the legislative
functions of the government. We have
witnessed an administration lobby here
this session that is both 'invidious and
insidious."
Col. Harry S. New, of Indianapolis,
Republican candidate for United States
Senator in Indiana, at the coming elec
tion, was a recent visitor at the Capitol,
where he was warmly received. Not
only is Col New optimistic over the
general outlook for the Republican
party all over the country, but he is
certain that his own state of Indiana
will return to the Republican party and
elect both the state and national tickets.
Speaking of the situation he said: "I
am confident the Republican party will
win in November. The people of this
country are doing some thinking. They
know that the present prosperity is
unnatural and has been brought about
by conditions absolutely growing out of
the war. In Indiana we will have a
Republican majority this fall. We
shall elect two ReDublican United
States Senators, more than half of the
members of the House and a Republi
can Governor. ' The electoral vote will
also go to our party."
These are anxious days for the Mis
souri delegation in Congress and the
situation in that state politically is be
ing discussed with great seriousness
and apprehension in the Democratic
cloak rooms. There are several Demo
cratic Members of the House from that
state who are already "scared out of
their boots" over the outlook. Tke
news they are getting from back home
has not been reassuring and they are
confidentially expressing great anxiety
over the possibility of their reelection.
Several of them are saying that they
fear not only their districts, but that
the state itself is going Republican.
The pairiag of Vice President Mar
shall with Senator Reed of Missouri,
on the last senate vote on the motion
to reconsider the rejection of George
Rublee of New Hampshire, as a Mem
ber of the Federal Trade Commission,
is causing much comment and criticism.
Many of the older members of both the
House and Senate, state that it is a
most dangerous precedent and that if
the vote of the vice-president had been
a deciding one, that great and sweep
ing legal questions would have arisen
as to the right to do this. Men long in
Congress state that the vice-president
is not a member of the Senate and that
his only right to vote is that prescribed
by the constitution, which is in case of
a tie.
The recent election in the second
West Virginia district, in which the
administration took a hand, but was de
feated, still continues to be talked
about at the capitol and the Democrats
still continue to be very touchy when
the event is mentioned in their pre
sence. Worry gives the undertaker more
business than work does.
