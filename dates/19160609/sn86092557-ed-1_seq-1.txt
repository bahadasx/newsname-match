NEW MILLION
FOOT GAS WELL
(HI
One of Them Belongs to
Monongahela Valley
Traction.
A million foot gas well was drilled
in yesterday evening and a new one i
that ought to be almost as good a pro* i
ducer was drilled in this morning in
the Miracle run territory, Battel dis- J
trlct. Monongalia county, near Cross
Roads, Marion county.
These wells are on adjoining leases
of the Shriver farm and the million
foot producer belongs to the Hope Gas
company.
Hope companys well is the property
o fthe Monongahela Valley Traction
company. *Both of these wells are in
the Gordon sand. A number of new
; locations by these companies and the
Carnegie Gas company have been
made on adjoining territory.
The rapid development of this Mir
acle run gas district has opened a new
gas territory in Marion and Mononga
lia counties and its is possible that
this will so stimulate drilling that
some new oil territory may bo discov
ered.
One Day Left in the Big Bonus
Offer of Seven Thousand Club
"Ono More Day" is all that la left J
in the big bonus vote offer in the West
Virginian's Seven Thousand Club,
through which more than 93.200 in pri
ses will be distributed among our
friends and readers. Just whero the
major portion of the big list of prizes
will go ii about as uncertain as to
whether it will be Hughes or Teddy in
Chicago. Both districts have about
an equal chance. But much may de
pend upon what is done during the re
maining few hours of this special of
fer. A determined effort now could
easily turn the scales of fortune one
way or tho other. The leaders stand
bunched close, and in some cases a
few hundred or a few thousand votes
at the most would upset the line-up
considerably.
Perhaps you have not been interest
ed in the seven thousand club before
this. It makes no difference, if you
act at once and securo a start under
the present special vote offer, you can
easily catch lip and forgo ahead of the
top-most leaders. The vote offer in
brief is as follows:
Fifty thousand extra votes with each
club of five yearly subscriptions or
their equivalent which you turn in be
fore tomorrow night (Saturday) at
nine o'clock. The subscriptions may
be either old or new for any length
or time from three months up. The
Fifty Thousand extra votes will be in
addition to the regular votes with each
subscription. There is no imlt to the
number of clubs that may be turned
of the Seven Thousand
e limit that is placed
r own effort and ener
To those whose homes are in dis
trict No. "2." and who may have diffi
culty in getting into the office at nine
tomorrow night, we will make a spe
cial concession. We will allow the
bonus votes on all business sent in by
mail providing it reaches us by Mon
day.
Your happiness,- and tho happiness
of those who' depend upon you may
bo hanging in the balance along with
one of tho many big prizes to bo dis
tributed on July" 8. You may wish for
an automobile, a piano, dlamohds,
talking machine, etc. but wishing nev
er gets one anywhere. Usually, how
ever. the proverbial luck of the wish
ing moon or the fable of the wishbone
amounts to nothing unless backed by
energy, and ambition. Even where
these qualltlos are in evidence, oppor
tunity does but seldom lift her head.
Many a man i* doomed to go on living
for years without enjoying the finer
things of life, simply because the only
avenue open by which he may secure
them is by slow and hard saving.
But you need wish no longer. No
matter what Jt is you desire you can
secure it through the West Virginian
Sev6n Thousand Club. All you need
tc do is put off doubting, and at at
once. Clip the nomination blank in
today's issue, or, if you are already a
member of the club, all you need to do
is start getting in the votes and sub
scriptions.
List Tomorrow.
No list of club members appears to
day. owing to lack of space, but to
morrow the list will again appear In
