The nnminl celebrution of Confcd
erute Memorial Day was observed
here last Saturday in an appropriate
manner. The occasion, which is al
wavS looked forward to by tin- sur-l
vivors of the conflict bet wen the
North and the South as a day of I
meeting und exchange of reminiscenc?
es, and a tolling and re-telling of in?
cidents of valor and heroism, is al-1
ways memorable in muny respects,
and enjoyed by those who have with?
stood the ravages of time and disease.
The attendance at the annual meetings
is naturally growing smaller each'
year, and the expression is oft heard,!
"I reckon this will be the last time
I will meet, with the 'old boys'." How?
ever, it is hoped thai thu attendance
next year will he large and that when1
the roll is called next year all who j
were present this year will answer
"present!"
Saturday was a beautiful day for
the occasion, notwithstanding the fuel
that in the early morning the rain
fell in torrents, and many who had
intended coming were compelled to
slay away.
The celebration was one of the mos',
pleasant and liest organised enter?
tainments given here in years. The
ladies who had the matter in charge
had all arrangements so perfected
that no untoward incident happened
to mar the pleasure of the day.
The program of the day Included
two papers, one by Major Whitman,
which was read by Miss Ellen Bow?
en, and the other by Judge Graham,
each of which were enjoyed and lis?
tened to attentively.
At the conclusion of these address?
es, crosses of honor were conferred
on the following: II. C. Asburv, Wm.
II. Cochran, R. P. Crockett, Jas. II.
Lester, J. P. llilt. W. D. Mays, Geo.
W. Patton, J. V. Stcphenson, the last
five of whom were present and re?
ceived their crosses. The Browne
Harman camp met after the conferr?
ing of the crosses, and re-elected Mai.
J. P. Whitman, commandant, ami Hon.
A. St. Clair, Adjutant.
A luncheon for the soldiers was
served in Greever's store and was
abundant and delicious.
The two papers following are por?
tions of the address of Judge Gra?
ham. Other sections of his address
and the paper rend by Major Whit?
man will he published at some future
/late.
Death of Lieutenant Samuel
Thompson,
In the summer of 1,804, it will he re?
membered thai the army commanded
by General .Inhal A. Early invad?
ed Maryland and menaced the Feder?
al capital ::t Washington; in fact,
his army stayed for three or four
.lay-- in the subuihs of what was then
called Georgetown. Having left, the
enemy in his rear at Harper's Kerry,
where he had driven it on the in?
vasion, hoavv duties ware imposed
upon the Confederate cavalry both in
rear and front. The day before the
battle of Monocacy Junction, a bri?
gade of cavalry was stationed near
Burkettsville, a Maryland humlet, in
the heart of the enemy's country. On
this invasion Lieutenant Samuel
Thompson, who was :?. native of Taxe
Weil and a member of the 16th Vir?
ginia Cavalry, was ordered to take
a squadron from his regiment and
make a reconnaissance in tie- rot r of
the army toward Maryland Heights;
which was really to ascertain any
movement that might be made men?
acing the column of General Early on
his march to Washington.
Thompson was n noted and trusted
officer of his command; a typical
cavalier; young, stalwart, cool and
brave. IIu was n very quiet man. was
swarthy and rather somber looking;
with a heavy beard, as was common in
those days.
Thompson was a lieutenant in Com?
pany I of the Kith Virginia Cavalry,
to which company I also belonged.
He left the main command about noon
and after proceeding a few miles, de?
ployed his men, requiring them to
march some distance apart. He asked
me to remain with him. Keening as
well as he could in sight of his men,
he told me that he would go to the
lop of a ridge skirted with some
woods, which would give him a good
view of the scouts that he had sent
out toward the Maryland Heights.
We were in an old field and, as we
were approaching the crest of the
ridge, an armed horseman emerged
from a thicket in the field. He seem?
ed to be riding a good horse and, be?
ing sorely in need of one myself, I
asked the Lieutenant to let me chase
him. He soon ran upon a rock fence
over which his horse could not mount,
so he took occasion to dismount, and
get into the woods out of the way.
I suppose I may tell you, that as I
was more after the horse than the
man, I also dismounted and changed
saddles, leading my pony back. About
the time I started back I heard the
report of a rifle and in a few mo?
ments saw Lieutenant Thompson's
horse running wild in the fields. I
kew that something was wrong and
hurried to the place where I thought
I might see the Lieutenant, near the
crest of the hill. There I found him
lying in the corner of the fence. I
did not see anyone who could have
done the shooting,, although there
was a thin skirt of woods close by.
Lieutenant Thompson was mortally
wounded?was really dying, and I
could learn nothing from him. Some
people from a neighboring house
came to where he was lying and of?
fered their assistance. A vehicle
was brought and the Lieutenant, was
placed in it and carried to the house,
the residence of a man by the name
of Groves, it was getting late in the
evening and they carried Lieutenant
Thompson, then barely alive, to nil
upper porch and made him as com?
fortable as possible.
In the meantime Captain William
Brown, who belonged to the 22nd Vir
ginia Cavalry, came by the house with
a detatchmcnt of his company, ami
UN
suggested that we leaVc directions
for the buriul of Licuteuant Thomp
son, wlioia we then recognized as
dead. I told Captain Brown that 1
did ot. wish to leave the Lieutenant
at that time, but would risk Staying
there until he could go back to the
army and inform my uncle. Colonel
William L. Graham, that Lieutenant
Thompson had been killed, and send
back to the house a mpiadroil of men
with whom 1 might return; so that
we could more certainly prepare for
[Thompson's burial.
! Many st rarere things occur in the
life of soldie I who hazarded what w<
did. Mr. Groves and his family wer?
i greatly distressed at what had hap?
pened so near their home, and were
very apprehensive that when the soldi?
ers returned for me they would uo
furious and probably do some violence
to them and their home. They as?
sured me that they were Southern
sympathizers, and even brought in
colored people whom they claimed
U; former slaves. I was impressed
with the honest) and truthfulness of
these people. . mong other things,
they told me that there was a very
iil man in one of the upper rooms,
who bad been a soldier in the Con?
federate army, from Missouri, and
who could assure me that the people
of the household were ?Southern sym?
pathizers and that they bad nothing
[whatever to do with the killing of
Licucnunt Thompson. They pre?
vailed on me to leave the porch where
I] was constantly on guard, and go
I to this man's room ami tall: with
him. His name was Willard. 1 found,
las Mr. Craves had informed me. that
he was in the last stages of consump
it ion. He told me that he had volun?
teered in the company of Captain
Slack, from Chillicothc, Mo., who
! afterwards became a colonel ami, I
'believe was killed at the battle of Pea
Ridge in Missouri. He also told me
I that he was captured at the buttle of
i Pea Ridge and was confined in the
penitentiary in St. Louis, Mo? where
most of the Confederates captured
during the fighting which occured in
Missouri were placed: that he was
'kept there untl he lost his health? that
I he Wiis paroled and tinned loose; and
that be came to Maryland and engag?
ed in school teaching. Ho assured me
that Mr. Groves was a Confederate
sympathizer, as wer?' most of the peo?
ple in the eighborhood, and that it
would be a crime to molest him and
his family or his property. Remem?
bering that I had two step uncles
Crockett and Kemper McDonald, who
had volunteered in Captain Slack's
company, and that they were both
captured, it occured to me that he
should know these men.
I knew that when the soldiers came
after me they would be greatly en?
raged, and that something would have
to be done to prevent them com?
mitting violence in the neighborhood
and especially upon the property of
Mr. Groves, because Lieutenant
Thompson was an exceedingly popu?
lar man with his soldiers. 1 asked
IWillard if.he knew these DcDonalds
and he seemed delighted at the men?
tion of their names and readily told
hue that they had been confined in the
1st. Louis penitentiary with him and
Iwere released at the same time. 1
went so fas as to ask him to ile
I scribe their personal appearance,
which he easily did, saying that
.Crockett McDonald had red hair and
a very freckled face (which was the
fact), and that there were no nar
Iticular marks about Kemper that, he
! could mention, except that he hail a
crooked nose, I at once knew that
I the man was sincere, and when the
squadron of soldiers came back that
[ night, they Were very much enraged
I at the sight of Lieutenant Thompson
land fully made up their minds to
, burn the house?wdiat eise they would
I have done 1 do not know. Lieutenant
'George Verdegen was in charge of
the squad, anil with him was James
IVail who was born and reared in
Tazewell, and I told them that 1 did
not believe Mr. droves had anything
to do with the killing of Lieutenant
Thompson and that I believed that he
was a .Southern sympathizer and had
already made preparations for the
burial of Lieutenant Thompson on
the next day. 1 took Verdegan and
Vail to the room of .Mr. Willard and
he at once convinced them that be had
been a Southern soldier and that Mr.
Craves and his family were South?
ern sympathizers. He again describ?
ed to Vail, wdio knew the McDonalds,
these two men, which convinced thesL'
soldiers of the truth of his statement.
The squad wdio remained in the yard
were told this fact and convinced that,
neither Mr. Groves nor any member
of his family was connected in any
way with the murder of Lieutenant
Thompson.
Arrangements were made that
night for the lieutenant's burial on
the next day,?early in the morning
?and a squad of the Kith Cavalry
came back to be present. We told Mi
Groves that the interment would be
only temporary and that when the
war ended the relatives of Lieutenant
Thompson would come ami take his
body to Virginia.
While I was a student at. Emory &
Henry College, 1 received a message
from these relatives asking me to ac?
company them to Maryland and iden?
tify Thompson's grave. Something
occured that prevented my going; but
I gave them such minute directions
that they easily found the home of
Mr. Groves, and the body of the
lieutenant was exhumed and brought
to Tazewell and now lies buried in the
family grave yard of Colonel Win.
Thompson in Thompson Valley.
A Romantic Feat of Colonel Edwin
Harm an.
We had many gallant officers and
privates volunteering from Tazewell
and who served in this long and
bloody war, many of them perfuming
deeds of valor and heroism, that, are
well nigh forgotten;?for these
great soldiers lived and fought in an
age and at a time when daring deeds
were hidden in the glamour of uni?
versal manhood and heroism. One of
these heroic deeds I wish to relate,
performed by as gallant soul as ever
bore the brunt of battle and who
lost his youthful and promising life
in a bloody struggle within cannon
1 sound of his native home. I can tell
i you now that the deed which I wish
' to record, and which so far as I know,
' has never been recorded, was not 'one
of courage, but a heroic effort to save
1 he lives of unfortunate soldiers.
As I remember, in the year, 18(>1,
i the Forty-fifth regiment of Virginia
? infantry was camped, for a while in
j the Holston Valley. Some Confed?
erate soldiers, probably four or five,
TAZEWELL, Vll
had been arrested and courtmartialcd
by General William E. Jones, who was
a strict military officer, 1 believe a
graduate of West Point, ami these
soldiers were sentenced to he shot, 1
think on the campus at Emory am!
Henry College, or, may he. at" Snlt
ville. These executions usually tai a
place early in the morning. A re?
prieve from ihe death sentence im?
posed on these men was granted and
dispatched to the headquarters of
the army where young Harmilll was
encamped.
When Edwin ilnrman was killed,
u '.Mil, in the battle of Cloyd's Karat,
in Kuluski County, he bor? the rank
of 1 ioutcnant Colonel of the .lath
Virginia regiment, hut I am not in?
formed, or, rather do not recollect,
whether he was of that rank when
these men were sentenced to death:
?anyway, he was a commissioned of?
ficer.
Edwin Harman was an expert horse?
man, and had with him at that lime
a blooded brown mare, which be rode
even when he was Captain. He vol?
unteered to carry the order of the re?
prieve to these unfortunate condemn?
ed men.
I have been told that the ride he
made, was not only worthy of his
blooded steed but of its manly und
pallant rider. '! he tale I heard of
this ride so far borders on the ro
matic, or even marvellous, that. 1 will
not venture at this day, to attempt to
describe it. 1 have been told thai
when he reached the place of intend?
ed execution of these men, each was
seated on a rude Collill and the platoon
of soldiers detailed to shoot them was
forming ranks. Their live.-; wore
saved.
I knew Colonel Harman from my
very earliest days. His father .?mil
mine wen- near neighbors on Blue
stone, in Taxewell County. Ho was
the son of Grailgi r Harman, anil was
really a very young man when he was
killed in battle.
Although Colonel Edwin Ilnrman
wns older than 1, he was my warm
friend, and many a day have we hunt?
ed together. Colonel Ilnrman was a
handsome man of noble bearing, lithe
and active. He was an athlete, -
a skillful horseman and lover of line
horses. Many a day have I watched
him and my father swimming in the
backwater at the falls of Bluestone
River, and envied the tricks they
would play in the stream. Colonel
llurmttll withal was a successful busi?
ness man in the short life allowed
him. When the war between the
States began, he was one of the first
to volunteer. He associated himself
with Colonel William Brown, another
Tazevvell boy. who left West Point
to join the Confederate Army. These
gallant youths rose rapidly in pro?
motion and were inseparable friends.
Colonel Brown attained the rank of
Colonel of the 45th regiment and
was killed in 1864, at. the battle of
New Market, only a short lime after
his comrade. Colonel Harman. Col?
onel Brown's body now lies in the new
cemetery at Tazevvell. and his grave is
marked with proper distinction.
In addition to these two sketches,
Judge Graham also included in his ad?
dress, a sketch entitled "An Escapade
of Colonel Henry S. Bowen and Colo?
nel Wm. I.. Graham." This will fol?
low some time in the future, lie clos?
ed his address as follow.;:
"My comrades will remember thai,
many of the private soldi.-is were
equal in character and breeding to
their commanders, ami thai they
proudly felt that they stood on U?l
equality with them and only recog?
nized their authority because they had
to have organization to command
them.
"The best evidence of this asser?
tion, is to remind an audience of
Colonel Bowen and Colonel Graham,
and Colonel Harman?brave and prou 1
men?the peers in character and in
every way of the general who com?
manded them, or any other man thill
belonged to the Confederate army.
"It seems that the modern regular
of the present day has to be placed
in camp and drilled and taught, for
a year before he is lit for duty. Such
was not the case with the soldiers of
the Confederate army. It was very
seldom?in fact, very rare?that, a
man in the army of the Confederacy
did not know perfectly well how to
handle a gun, how to ride, how to
camp, and how to take care of him?
self.
In (he mighty struggle for the
evolution of the human race towards
its perefction, war has marked its
path from the beginning, and will
continue fiercer and fiercer to the
end; and 1 have long believed that it
takes these heroic efforts to elevate
hnnkind above the inevitable effete
ness of so-called civilization anil fa?
naticism."

and popular building contractor of

A HUNGRY HUP.
Dev. While's Car Atlcmpts lo lader
Grocery by Plate Class Window.
Monday evening about. I!'.!t0, the
Hupmobilo touring car ol' I!. W.
White, or the Cove, attempted lo entei
the grocery store of llarrisson, Hum
& Co., via the pla'.e glass window, and
as a result the large glass was smash?
ed to pieces, and Mr. While rccicved
a scare that will slop his growth.
Mr. White was arranging to leave
town and "cranked" his car as usual,
and as soon as the engine got in mo
tion, il developed that the car had
been lefl in gear, consequently i:
moved oil' down the street. .Mr. White
attempted lo offset this forward mo
lion by pushing against Ihe force of
the engine, but the horsepower of
the "Hup", some forty-odd, overcome
ihe resistance of one man power, and
started for the store with Mr. While
in front of il. .Mr. White was push?
ed against the window, hut the pro?
jecting spring of the ear saved the
owner from injury.

WAR MINISTER .AND STAFF
DROWN WHEN HAMPSHIRE
SINKS.
London, Juneti.?All Britain was
stunned tonight by grief over the
tragic loss of Karl Kitchener, who,
with his entire stall', as secretary of
state for war, was dl'OWIldcd last night
ol'.' (In- Orkney Islands when tin; cruis?
er Hampshire, on which they were
voyaging I'm Russin, was sunk. First
news of England's greatest personal
loss since I he war began was made
public by the admiralty just before
noon today in the following official
sUltement received from Admiral
Jellicoe:
"The commnnder-in-chief <if the
grand fleet reports with deep regret
thai II. M. S. Hampshire, Captain
Herbert .1. Saville, R. N., with Lord
Kitchener and his staff on board, was
sunk las', night about 8 o'clock to the
west, of the Orkey Islands, either
by a mine or torpedo.
"Four boats were seen by observ?
ers on shore to leave the ship. The
wind was north-northwest and a heavy,
sea was running. Patrol vessels atull
destroyers at once proceeded to the
spot and a party was sent along the
coast to search, but only some bodies
and a capsized boat, have been found
up to the present.
"As the whole shore has been search?
ed from the seaward, 1 greatly fear
that there is little hope of there be?
ing any survivors.
"No report has yet. been rociovcd
from the searching party on shore
II. M. S. Hampshire was on her way
lo Russia."
Official hope of Karl Kitchener be?
ing found alive was indicated as en?
tirely abandoned when the press bur?
eau announced tonight that memorial
services would be held in St. Paul's at
a date as yet unfixed. An army order
also was issued directing that officers
shall wear mourning for the luto war
secreUiry for tho week commencing
tomorrow.
