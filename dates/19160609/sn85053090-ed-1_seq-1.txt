was one of the largest ever held
at the opera house, many coming
in from there for the occassion.
The well known excellence of

a large attendance by local peo
ple and it was well toward morn
ing before the dancers could in
duce themselves to depart.— Sen

The Battle Cry of Peace
"The intention of this picture
was to portray the great need of
preparedness of peace spelled
P-O-W-E-R." With that state
ment J. Stuart Blackton, author
of the scenario "The Battle Cry
of Peace," which opened at the
Olympic last evening, struck the
keynote of the whole situation,
"The Battle Cry of Peace"
surely fulfills the every entention
of the author, for it portrays a
poignant truth.in a characteristic
way that cannot fail of apprecia
tion, It is not exactly a pretty
thought to think of our great big,
splendid New York, with its
magnificent and imposing struct
ures, watçhing like Druids of old
the equally as splendid harbor,
crumbling like so much timber
before the heavy on-slaught of
the enemy; it is not a pretty
thought to think that the failure
of the men and women of our
communities» to demand of our
congressmen a vote for more ap
propriations for our army, and
more especially, perhaps, the
navy; it is not a pretty thought
to feel that the advocates of peace
are not exercising their very best
judgment in thetr nation-wide
campaign for such; but J. Stuart
Black ton, somehow has struck a
timely, theme for his scenario that
brings home almost too vividly
the total inadequacy of our pre
paredness, without which the na
tion can be assured of "peace and
plenty" and "peace with honor"
It stirs within one that inevit
able spirit of patriotism that is
burn within one, and while many
in last night's audience felt, per
haps, that the horrors of "unpre
parednes" were a bit overdrawn,
it instilled into them a little germ
of thought that will gradually as
sume proportions of magnitude.
The photography of the play is
all that could be desired, and the
general effect is calculated to
to please the most exacting.
Some idea of the magnitude of
the production may be gleaned
from the-fact that 25,000 National
Guard troops, 800 members of
the G. A. R.. 5,000 horses and
8 ,060 supernumeraries were skil
fully directed by Mr. Blackton.
—Chicago Evening Post.
Goood Show Coming
"The Battle Cry of Peace," a
ten reel feature produced by the
Vitagraph Comyany of America
is billed for Ekalaka at the Play
House on Monday June 19th,
showing both afternoon and eve
niug. The excellence and magni
tude of this sceeen play deserves
a good patronage and no doubt
packed houses will greet both
preformances. Considering the
prices of 50c and 75c that are be
ing charged in larger cities foi
the opportunity of witnessing
this feature the Ekalaka prices
of 5oc and $1.00 are entirely
within reach of all and very rea
sonable. Many country folks
will no doubt avail themselves of
the opportunity and attend the
shows in Ekalaka.
George Grant Resigns.
George G. Grant, has resigned
his position as county auditor and
L. E. Rushton has been appoint
ied to fill his office until the next
! general election. Mr. Grant has
I accepted a position with the
state auditor's office at Helena
land will enter upon his new
! duties at once. He has made an
! excellent official and while Fallon
County is the loser all are glad
; to see George go higher up, a
I promotion he justly deserves.
Important Bill Passes
Both Houses of Congress have
passed a sound, comprehensive,
progressive rural credits bill.
Upon its passage in both House
and Senate, the Republicans and
Progressives joined almost un
animously with the Democrats in
voting for the measure. Why?
Simply because this addition to
the series of constructive laws
put through by Woodrow Wilson
will make available for the de
velopment of agriculture a huge
reservior of capital at fair and
reasonable interest rates. For
the sake of their individual polit
ical fortunes, the opponents of
Wilson and Democracy dared not
vote against the bill. It would
have been political suicide.
The farmers of this country are
under a great debt of obligation
for this service. To whom? To
those who feil in line and voted
"aye" at the last minute, because
they had to? Or to the leadership
which initiated the fight and the
party which stood with and be
hind its leader and "put it over?"
Men of the fields, progressive
democracy under Woodrow Wil
son stands for the just needs and
rights of the whole people
these United States and their
political opponents in Congress
have formally admitted it by
their votes upon practically every
great reform measure that has
reached a vote.
