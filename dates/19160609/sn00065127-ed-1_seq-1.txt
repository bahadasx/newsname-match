WHAT DO YOU THINK?
Hon. A. R. Brown Calls the Voters
Attention to an Important Ques
tion in Next Election.
Du we realize that at the forthcom
ing general election there will be
placed before the electorate of this
state for adoption or rejection, a
question of far more than ordinary
importance, one which bears more
directly upon the domestic tranquill
ity of our people than any others
which the electors will decide.
Simply stated It is this: Shall the
womanhood of South Dakota be ele
vated to full citizenship, or shall they
continue to remain as subject in a
laud professing to give to every citizen
freedom and equality under its laws?
We ask our voters to seriously con
sider this question and in an impar
tial manner discover what principles
arelnvolved, and then cast their ballots
upon this subject as their best judg
ment dictates. And first, Can it be
possible, that a republican goverr
meut can reach its fullest fruitage, us
long as a large number of Its people
having requisite age, and education,
remain subjects, without the right to
xxxxxxxx
participate In determining what shall
be the laws under which they must
be governed?
.-econri, Can It be that the women
of South Dakota, are competent to
vote on all questions pertaining to the
education of the young, perhaps the
most Important subject upon which
our electorate have to pass, and, are
never-the-less Incompetent to cast a
vote upon any other species of legisla
tion, not even those of the smallest
importance? And yet tills paradox
truly represents the condition of
South Dakota in this 20th century of
civilization.
Is it not apparent to the most ob
tuse and dullest mind, that the ballot
should be taken from our women as
to matters pertaining to our schools,
or extended to them on all subjects
affecting public interest? Let the
voter at the coming election consider
this problem carefully among the
many others Involved.

Clover and Alfalfa Bloat.
According to circular five of the
Kentucky Experiment Station, It has
been found that the cause of bloat In
cattle following the eating of either
clover 3r alfalfa pasture Is due to the
fermentation of the sugar contained
In the blossoms. Red clover blossoms
contain about three and six-tenths per
cent sugar, alfalfa blossoms two and
eight-tenths per cent. Soon after be
ing eaten, fermentation begins re
sulting la the production of a consid
erable quantity of carbon dioxide.
This distends the tirst stomach or
rumen and produces the condition
known as bloat.
The authors of th« Kentucky bulle
tin strongly recommend to use of
formalin for this condition. One quart
of a one and one-half per cent solution
Is given as a drench. One and one
half per cent solution Is made by add
ing three tablespoonfuls of formalin
to one quart of water. Gentle exer
cises should be given to the animal
if possible after the medicine has been
given. This treatment Is simple, safe,
and Inexpensive, and should be kept
on hand so that it may be used on a
moments notice should necessity re
quire.—Dr. C. C. Lipp, College Vet
erinarian, S. D., State College.
Last Thursday at the Catholic
church in Worthing occured the
marriage of Miss Veneada masser,
daughter of r. and rs Jacob Glasser
of this city, to Louis Zanders, form
erly of Detroit, Mich but who has
made this city his home for several
years past, Rev. Father Parke of
Lennox performing the ceremony In
the presence of Mrs. Marie Walrath
and Miss Florence Glasser, of this
city, sisters of the bride. They will
make their home with her parents'
until they can secure a house. The
bride is a graduate of the Canton high
school in the class of 1913, and has
since been a successful teacher. They
have many friends who are extending
congratulations.
This Is Rooster Week.
Next week is "Swat the Rooster"
week in South Dakota and Saturday,
June 10, is "Rooster Day." Thousands
of circulars and placards have been
sent from the office of the state food
and drug commissioner to every town
in the state and distributed by mer
chants and commission men to farm
ers. These circulars announce "Roost
er Day" as a means to the production
of better eggs and warn farmers and
merchants against selling eggs unfit
for food. Fertile eggs undergo de
cora postltion much more quickly than
the infertile, hence the agitation to
induce farmers to remove all male
birds from their flocks immediately
after the close of the spring breeding
season. Where well bred, valuable
roosters are owned, these are not kill
ed, but simply taken from the Locks
and kept In separate pens during the
summer month*. All other male birds
should be killed or sold for slaughter
next week, as they will never bring
more than now, and consequently
their maintenance longer is not only
a dead loss but they cause an enor
mous depreciation in egg values when
allowed to run with the hens during
the summer months.
The "Rooster Day" campaign in this
state during the past two seasons has
resulted in the elimination of thous
ands of male birds consequently
great Improvement in the quality of
eggs shipped to eastern markets.
