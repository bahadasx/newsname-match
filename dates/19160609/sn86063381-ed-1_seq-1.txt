PREPAREDNESS IN
AN ADDRESS HERE
Frank B. Kellogg, candidate for
United States senator against Moses
E. Clapp, invaded Bemidji yesterday

crowd at the city hall last night.

Mr. Kellogg in his address said in
part:
"The questions of preparedness, in
my judgment, is the paramount prob-
THE BEMIDJI
lems confronting the people of this
country today. I know of only one
way to make preparation to defend
our institutions and that is to ac
quire a reasonable army and navy
and inspire the people with the high
est spirit of patriotism and a deter
mination that our institutions shall
be maintained. I believe in the pro
tection of American citizens on the
high seas, in foreign lands, and in
all the world. I believe in making
American institutions a prize to be
proud of the world over, and I be
lieve the only way to maintain our
high standard of civilization is to
maintain the standard of American
institutions. I believe in protecting
American commerce, which is the
foundation of all our great interests,
because without that bulwark we can
not truly fill the market for the pro
ducts of the American farm and
American labor. Preparedness is
preparation, an insurance policy for
peace

BEMIDJI MAN ATTENDS
BORDER CITY MEETING
John Harris is in International
Falls today attending the district
meeting of the Presbyterian Chris
tion Endeavor societies. The meet
ing will continue for three days.
THREE CITIES AFTER
STATE ELKS' MEET
Duluth, Minn., June 9.Three
cities have already entered the fight
for the 1917 convention of the Min
nesota State Elks' association, this
year's meeting being scheduled for
this city on June 14 and 15.
Although the 1916 meeting is a
week away, word has been received
here that the Virginia, Mankato and
Red Wing lodges will send large dele
gations in an effort to land next
year's convention. Red Wing made
a strong fight for the meeting a year
ago, but was beaten by Duluth.
Whether other cities will enter the
fight, is not known, although it would
not be surprising that six or seven
lodges offer invitations for the 1917
meeting during the opening business
session on June 14.
John E. Samuelson of this city,
treasurer of the state association and
past exalted ruler of Duluth lodge,
is being boomed by Duluth Elks for
the presidency to succeed James B.
Healy of St. Paul, present incumbent.
W. L. Dehart arrived in the city
this morning from Duluth and will
visit for a short time with his par
ents, Mr. and Mrs. W. Dehart. Mr.
Dehart will leave tomorrow for his
home at International Falls.

OYSTER BAY BELIEVES
G. 0. P. WILLNOMINATE T. R.
Bull Moosers Fail to Get Response
From G. 0. P. Hughes
Boomers.
(By United Press.)
Chicago, June 9.Unless the Pro
gressive pussy-footers can hold the
Progressive radicals checked, they
will nominate Theodore Roosevelt
late this afternoon. The Republi
cans will then take their pick.
The Progressives are insistent that
they will nominate Teddy. They
failed to get a response from the G.
O. P. Hughes boomers, so they will
insist upon an early balloting. The
situation has reversed into what in
fluence both convention's bosses have
upon the masses.
May Use Platform.
A radical Progressive stampede for
Roosevelt was assured this afternoon
when the Progressives learned that
the Republicans are going ahead with
the nominations. The Republicans
have nothing on the table but nom
inating speeches while the Progres
sives still have the platform on the
table. It is thought that in a pinch
the platform would be used to stop
the gap by Perkins to hold off Teddy's
nomination.
Convene at 10:26.
The Progressives convened at 10:
26. The conference committee is
still debating and the consideration
of the platform, plank by plank, was
taken up.
The peace committee asked the con
vention for another conference with
the Republicans.
Peace Report Made.
The Progressive peace committee
reported this afternoon as follows:
"Your committee met with a com
mittee from the Republican conven
tion last night. The conference was
most friendly and immediately upon
assembly your committee proposed as
a joint nominee of both parties Theo
dore Roosevelt. The committee* rep
resenting the Republican convention
did not present a name. They did
not attempt to refuse our arguments
regarding the advisability of Roose
velt. After several hours of friendly
conference we decided to adjourn,
suggesting a further conference this
afternoon if possible."
There was little cheering when the
report was concluded.
Must Invite Teddy.
Oyster Bay, June 9.Political cir
cles here, meaning Sagamore Hill,
are confident that the Republican
convention must invite Roosevelt to
talk to the convention. It was also
asserted that the only amalgamation
candidate Roosevelt will thoroughly
approve is Roosevelt.
Roosevelt's statement to corre
spondents was that he did not see a
change of the situation in Chicago
calling him to Chicago.
Friends today stated that there is
a possibility of the Republicans nom
inating Hughes and the Bull Moose
nominating Roosevelt. Then Hughes
would withdraw on account of the
deadlock. Then there is a possibility
that the Colonel will go to Chicago
to straighten the tangle.

SHERMAN NOMINATES.
Chicago, June 9.William J. Cal
houn in nominating Senator Sherman
of Illinois this afternoon, said in
part: "The story of his life is sim
ple. It was developed among the
conditions oT
the most extreme pov-
erty. His poveny was not the soul
shriveling poverty of the slums, but
of farming, his opportunities for
education were few, tut his desitet.
therefore were tense He attended
the country sohool, then the country
college and later studied law His
career at the bar was limited but
highly honorable. He finally became
interested in politics, became lieuten
ant governor, was twice elected to the
U. S. senate. His intellect is clear
and his soul is pure."
CUMMINS NOMINATED.
Chicago, June 9.N. E. Kindall
of Albia, la., nominated Senator Cum
mins this afternoon in the G. O. P.
convention. He said in part: "Cum
mins is the best adapted to further
charity toward all, malice toward
none." Regarding the Wilson ad
ministration, he said: "Behold, we
cannot look around without a fear of
panic and we cannot look at home
without a fear of panic."
BRUMBAUGH NOMINATED.
Chicago, 111., June 9.Emmerson
Collins of Pennsylvania, in nominat
ing Governor Brumbaugh at the G.
O. P. convention this afternoon, said:
"Pennsylvania's present governor,
Martin Grove Brumbaugh, was born
in Pennsylvania, reared in her tend
erest traditions and typifies best her
traditions. Two years ago he re
organized the broken ranks of the
state party and won. His adminis
tration has been constructive. His
Americanism yields to none."
LA FOLLETTE NOMINATED
Chicago, 111., June 9.M. B. Ol
brish of Madison nominated Senator
La Follette this afternoon. He laud
ed La Follette as a peace candidate^
and said in part:
"Much talk of guns and drums may
disturb, may confuse, may control
the judgment of the hour, but will
not control or stampede the judgment
of the American people. The 99 per
cent of the people whose bodies must
receive bullets and whose children
and children's children must pay and
die, for them, who do not sell muni
tions, and who do not float war loans,
Wisconsin speaks."
FAIRBANKS NOMINATED
Chicago, 111., June 9.Congress
man Wood of Lafayette, Ind., nom

He said: "He adheres unerringly
to the fundamental principles of the
Republican party."
WEEKS NOMINATED.
Chicago, June 9.Senator Lodge
nominated Senator Weeks of Massa
chusetts,
"We must have a man thoroughly
in accord with Republican princi-
ples," sad Senator Lodge. "He must
be a man who believes the protec
tion of American rights on land and
sea, loves neutrality, peace and jus
tice. He must believe in prepared
ness and be a thorough American. He
must be one who wants to keep alive

Committeeman No Caucus
Decided.
(By United Press.)
Chicago, 111., June 9.It is rain
ing again today and there is much
gloom in this "windy city." Again
the newspapers have come forward
with an alibi in regard to the
weather. They claim that the weath
er is the worst since 1870.
Balloting in the Republican con
vention is expected to start at four
o'clock this afternoon.
May Not Survive.
Favorite sons today declared that
Hughes boomers must nominate
Hughes on the second ballot or he
can't survive. The allies claim they
hold 587 votes on the first ballot of
which Hughes has about 200. It
is anticipated that after the first bal
lot several hundred delegates will be
released. If Hughes fails to get
them, the sons claim that he is lost.
Congdon Selected.
C. A. Congdon, Duluth, was elected
Republican national committeeman
for Minnesota at a meeting late yes
terday. George Hanscom of St.
Cloud led the opposition against
Congdon.
Minnesota delegates decided today
not to -caucus until after the first bal
lot. They would give the first ballot
to Senator Cummins of Iowa.
Hold Conference.
Conference committees of the Re
publican and Progressive conven
tions held a discussion of peace plans
last night.
The conferees "were unanimous- to
asserting that the conference was en
tirely harmonious. Discussion of
candidates followed just these lines:
The Progressives talked only about
Colonel Roosevelt, the Republican
conferees suggested the names of va
rious favorite sons, including Fair
banks, Burton, Root, Hughes and
others, but reached no unanimous
decision that they favored any of
them above the other. The entire
range of discussion it was said never
got beyond a generality.
To Invite T. R.
Delegate Weunberg of Maryland
today stated that he would introduce
a resolution inviting Roosevelt to
come to Chicago to address the Re
publicans.
Senator Smoot pussy-footed over to
the Auditorium this morning for a
conference with the Moose dealers,
Senator Smoot presented the report
of the peace committee and in report
ing stated that the Progressives be
lieved that Roosevelt should be nom
inated. This got cheers from the
galleries and a scattered applause
among the delegates. The applause
lasted one minute and a half.
Taft is Cheered.
Some delegate this afternoon men
tioned William Howard Taft's name
on the floor. It was greeted by the
loudest cheering of the Republican
convention thus far, and was follow
ed by the waving of hats for the first
time. The demonstration lasted for
five minutes.
Senator Smoot late this afternoon
stated that he thought two ballots on
the presidential nomination would
probably be taken today. He stated
that the G. O. P. would then adjourn
until tomorrow. He would not make
any predictions on the result of the
voting. CASS LAKE WARDENS

Marshall, forest supervisor and Geo.
Farley, forest ranger at Cut Foot
picked up three large fish nets in
the Cut Foot country containing
about nine hundred pounds of fish.
The largest net was over 160 feet
