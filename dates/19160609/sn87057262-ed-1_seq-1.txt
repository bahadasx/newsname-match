Whitman nominating Hughes, said:
"We are assembled here to name

response to the demand, of the Amer

here to select the next president ot

"The national horizon is dark and
troubled. From afar, the lurid flashes
of a world war remind us of our own

"We bring to you today the name

from the animosities engendered by
factional strife, his private life above

Mention of the name of Wm. H.
Taft, evoked the only real rous
ing demonstration of the meet
ing so far, the first time that
the delegates all over the flood Btood
up, waved their hats and yelled
wildly.
After it had continued for three
minutes, the band's services were re
quisitioned. The blare bad its effect
and order was just about to be re
stored when A1 F. Williams, of Kan
sas, delegate and a picturesque figure
with long flowing hair, stood up on
Jiis chair and waved like a mad man,
organizing the cheers. The demon
stration lasted about five minutes.
The greatest deomnstratlon to date
however, came when Whitman finish
ed at 12:12, not mentioning the can
didate's name until the last words
of his speech. Then the din broke
loose. It was noticea/ble that New
York's delegation wasn't particularly
excited although a few of the dele
gates stood up and applauded.
The Vermont delegation were the
real cheer leaders. They stood on
their chairs and whooped it up strong.
Oregon's representatives—the only
delegates instructed for the Justice
by a primary, were hardly second in
their enthusiasm. The band was
started In an effort to stop the .noise
but only succeeded in adding emph
asis to the din. Henry G. Beyer, of
Portland. Maine, produced a paper
mache elephant which he carried
aloft down the main aisle, causing
another tremendous outbreak. The
Oregon crowd started parading on
the floor. The Vermont delegates
got the fevet at the same moment.
Mississippi next came along, the
delegates rooting up their standard
and marching along, a raving, cheer

acterized Root as the greatest states
man of all time.
"Just now, our very difficult prob
lem merges into that of finding the
real American," he said.
"Americanism," as he sodtaded it,
was only sparingly applauded and he
plunged quickly into a biographical
study of Root.
Spatters of hand clapping came
occasionally but there was no en
thusiastic outburst as he eulogized
Root's record.
"The American democracy asks a
man of vision and leadership," he
declared. "Let us take counsel of
courage, not fear. Let us fortify our
selves at home as well as to restore
our repute abroad."
The first spontaneous outburst
greeted his remarks as he urged a
strong Americanism.
"A resolute, just, all-absorbing"
type of patriotism, which should
stand as the keystone of generations
to come, was the substance of his
message on this point.
Woman Cuts Loose.
A storm broke loose Immediately
after Butler closed. It started
sweepingly, but got spotty before
long. Then a women, who said she
was Mrs. Thomas Root, daughter-in
law of the senator, in the gallery
back of the speaker's stand, cut loose
with the wildest, most maniacal yells
so far heard.
Many delegates were so interested
in watching her performance that
they forgot to clap themselves.

age, but a youngster Just the same,
stood on his seat and lifted his voice
in yowls. The former senator waved
a flag.
Then some one handed the woman
two American flags and she started

was shoved back at a queer angle—

CHICAGO, 'June 9.—The peculiar
play of big personalities through the
hurly-burly of these republican and
progressive national conventions is
a little show of its own.
Every delegate, every big national

[By H. L. Rennlck, United PreBS Staff
Correspondent]
CHICAGO, June 9.—The progres
sive national convention convened at
10:26 a. m. today, facing a fight to
nominate Roosevelt immediately after
the conference committee reported on
its peace move with the republicans.
Conservative leaders, however, agreed
to force the platform before the con
vention today and hold the radicals to
this plan.
The"ratllfihls, however, •will begin
their fight to nominate immediately
upon receipt of news that balloting
has begun at the republican conven
tion.
Before the convention opened, some
of the radicals, mad as ho/-net.i. con
sidered the oonvention had not passed
the Rubicon, In failing to nominate
Colonel Roosevelt yesterday.
"There's no use now it's only a
dicker," one of them said.
At the same time, it was reported
many of the delegates have been won
over to Hughes and would accept
him if Colonel Roosevelt endorses
the justice.
Others insisted the republicans
mist at least recognize a progres ?lv-?,
perhaps Gov. Hiram Johnson of Cali
fornia, with the vice presidency. John
son, it was reported, would not ac
cept any republican honors.
For the first time in the conven
tion, the platform was guarded by
policemen.
Henry J. Allen of Kansas, radical
leader, said his faction had deter
mined to delay the nomination of
Roosevelt until the conference com
mittee had more time to act.
"We will start, though, the minute
the republicans begin balloting," ho
said.
The delegates were cheering and
singing, as usual, when they entered
the Auditorium.
Rabbi Joseph Stolz delivered the in
vocation today. While the confer
ence committee delayed their arrival
several delegates, including Chas. E
Mason of Maine, were permitted to
speak to take up time.
The crowd cheered Delegate Hut
cbens of Georgia, when he shouted:
"We would rather fight and lose than
not to fight at all."
While the conference committee
was reported still debating the con
vention went ahead with considera
tion of the platform, paragraph by

Immediately upon assembling, your

representing the republican conven

candidate, nor did it attempt to re
fute our arguments relating to the
unique availability of Theodore
Roosevelt as a candidate to units
both parties or to serve our common
country at this crucial period in the
history of the world.

discussion, during which no concrete
proposition was advanced by the re

further conference might be desirable
this afternoon or evening, the Joint
committee adjourned.

The progressive delegates, miscon

republicans spoke of unanimity

They hissed and groaned as the
republican report was read again and
they learned the republicans had sail

Albert Bushnell Hart of Boston,
leaped to his feet and demanded as

under the agreement for conferences.
"We are in entire liberty and with
ample time and we don't intend to
