cussion resulted in the adoption
of a resolution asking the Secre
tary of the Interior to allow the

At a special meeting of the Gila
Valley Water Users Association held
today I was instructed to request the
Interior Department to allow us to
spend the ten thousand appropriated
by Congress in accordance with para
graphs 43 and 44 of Gen Marshalls
report His report is very complete
and we deem the further expenditure
of money for surveys unnecessary and
request that we be allowed to expend
the ten thousand on actual protection
work This association is ready to give
oond for the proper expenditure and
accounting of the money in experi
mental work controlling the flood waters
of the Gila River We desire to call
your attention to the necessity of prompt
action in order to avoid the erosion from
the summer floods Prompt action will
save many homes

In response to your telegram of

surveys in actual protection work
along the Gila river I took the matter
up with the Commissioner of Indian
AITairs as well as the Secretary of the

this amount can be used only for the
special purpose named in the bill
I regret that tho Secretary could
not see his way clear under existing
law to use this money as requested in
our telegram and stand ready at any
time to render any possible assistance
to your Association
Yours very smccrelv
M A Smith
According to these different
communications it will be im
possible to use the appropriation
of 10000 for any other purpose
except surveys etc After sur
veys ha e been made it is hoped
that a further appropriation may
be secured from Congress to do
the actual protection work nec
essary to save the land abutting
on the river from being washed
