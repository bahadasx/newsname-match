BOY IS ACCIDENTALLY SHOT
IGNACE GAMRADT VICTIM OF AC
CIDENT WHILE OUT HUNT
ING WITH BROTHER
Ignace Gamradt aged nine years,
son of Mr. and Mrs. Max Gamradt of
this city, is in a critical condition at
the Hall hospital, following an acci
dent with a .22 calibre rifle which re
sulted in his being shot. The accident
occurred late Monday afternoon, east
of this city.
The young boy, together with his
brother Max, aged 11 years, accompan
ied their father to the slaughter house
of the Little Falls Packing company,
where he was to put up a new building,
earlv Monday afternoon. On the way
out the boys had evidently seen some
wild game which they wanted to get a
shot at and after arriving at the
slaughter house the older boy walked
home and got his father's rifle, with
out first getting his father's permis
sion. His brother met him a short dis
tance from the city and they started
out to find their game, the older boy
in the rear carrying the rifle. He car
ried it on his shoulder, with the muz
zle forward, and it was accidentally
discharged with the trigger caught on
a pin which was fastened on his coat.
The bullet struck Ignace, the younger
boy, in the left side, just below the
armpit, glanced off a rib and took a
downward course, penetrating one
lung. The accident occurred near the
Edling farm, about a mile east of this
city.
Immediately the injured boy's broth
er ran to the place where his father
was working and told him that he had
accidentally shot his brother Ignace.
Mr. Gamradt hitched up his team and
went and got the injured boy and rush
ed him to his home. From there he
was taken to the Hall hospital in an
automobile and late in the evening an
operation was performed and the flow
of blood from the internal wounds
was stopped by the tying of an ar
tery. The bullet was not found.
The boy has been resting well since
the accident, considering its nature,
and hr.s a fighting chance for recovery,

HJRIDDSSFECUL POLICE
CITY EXECUTIVE, UNABLE TO
GET ACTION BY COUNCIL AP
POINTS SPECIAL OFFICER
Failing to get another patrolman for
the day force in this city by asking
the council for it and presenting a big
petition signed by residents of the
West side, Mayor Fortier has appoint
ed L. C. Smith as special police and
he will act as day patrolman on the
West side during the summer months.
He will be reappointed every other
day by the mayor, as the mayor has no
authority to appoint more than the
specified number of regular police and
can appoint special police for only 48
hours at one time. This method is to
be continued unless the council author
izes another regular policeman.
Mayor Fortiei states that it is ab
solutely necessary to have another po
liceman here at this time of the year.
Numerous complaints of tramps mak
ing things unpleasant for housewives
have been reported to him, he says,
and the Indian treaty lid has also
caused an influx of undesirables whom
the police must look after.
At the council meeting Monday eve
ning the mayor asked the council to
authorize the appointment of another
patrolman for the summer months, and
his letter was accompanied by the pe
tition, which was signed by about one
hundred residents of the West side, in
cluding all the business men. The
council decided to leave the matter
until the next meeting, which result
ed in the major taking the action
above mentioned.
SALOON LICENSES GRANTED TO
17—LET CONTRACT FOR CON
CRETE FLOOR, CITY HALL
sgular
Mon-
The city council held a re
monthly meeting at the city hall
day evening, with the following mem
bers present: Hall, Moeglein, Brown,
Johnson, John and Farrow.
A resolution was passed granting the
Northwestern Telephone Exchange
company a permit to construct an un
derground tunnel for telephone cables
on First street northeast and a part
of Broadway. All underground service
must be put in before First street is
paved, including water service, etc.
A. B. Peterson & Company were
awarded the contract to put in a con
crete floor in the city Hall for $429.
They were the only bidders.
Assessor Ellenbecker was allowed
one-half of his salary, amounting to
$250, and the clerk was instructed to
draw a warrant for same.
The bond of the Transcript Publish
ing company for legal printing, in the
sum of $1,500, was approved. Herman
Pantzke and A. F. Koslosky were
sureties.
Paul Hapka was granted a permit
to repair the wooden stairway on. his
building on Broadway, also to repair
the steps in front of bis saloon and to
paint the building.
The city clerk was instructed to get
a permit from the state game warden
to capture a bull moose for the Pine
Grove park. The park committee was
authorized to accept the animal and
the city will pay for the care of it af
ter it is received. Joe Groweth of
Warroad has promised to catch one for
$75, which sum has been raised by
public subscription and by benefits
given by the Moose lodge of this city.
Alderman John called the council's
attention to the fact that children
have been in the habit of building fires
in the Pine Grove park, also that the
farmers have been using the park
driveways for thoroughfares, hauling
hay, stock, etc., over them. The re
sult, he said, is a very unkempt appear
ance in the park. He urged that an
ordinance be passed prohibiting the
building of fires in the park and also
asked that signs be put up notifying
people not to use the park drivewnys
for other than pleasure and sightseeing
purposes. The matter was referred to
the park committee and they will prob
ably have some form of legislation
drafted to be brought up at a later
meeting of the council.
Notice of the election of officers for
the ensuing year in Chemical company
No. 1 was received and the election
confirmed.
Out of nineteen applications for sa
loon licenses, seventeen, the limit al
lowed by ordinance, were granted, to
the following persons:
Lucas SchriebeT, Paul Hapka, Bour
assa & Bergquist, Frank H. Janski, F.
W. Gallipo, Frank Wachlarowicz, Jos.
Medved, F. D. LeBlanc, Mathias Miller,
Peter Posch, John Johnson, Noah H.
White, T. J. Monahan, John Simon,
Thos. F. Wagner, Mike Kowalczyk, La
Fond & Arendt.
Those who were refused licenses
were A. B. Trebiatowski and John J.
Reh. On the former all voted "no"
except Johnson and Farrow, who vot
ed "yes." On the latter all voted
"no" except Johnson, who voted
"yes." The vote on all those which
were granted was unanimous.
A communication from Mayor For
tier asking that another policeman be
put on the force, was left until the
next meeting. The communication was
accompanied by a petition containing
the signatures of about 100 West side
residents, who asked that a policeman
be assigned to the West side for the
summer months.
Permits were granted to all the resi
dents of the block between Fourth and
Fifth avenues on Eighth street south
west to construct cement sidewalks.
F. Graham appeared before the coun
cil and asked what had been done in
regard to the extension of the water
main on Fourth street northeast for
one block, for which a petition was
presented about a year ago. Alderman
Brown moved that the main be built,
but this brought about a discussion
which finally resulted in his motion
being lost, none of the members being
willing to second it. Mr. Moeglein was
the first one to object to the extension
of the water main, his contention be
ing that those who wanted water in
that block could do as some others in
the city have done, uake connections
from the water main at his own ex
pense. Alderman Hall was of the
same opinion. The reason the coun
cilmen objected to installing water
mains along the block as petitioned for
was that by some error the residents
along that street got the sewer free,
that is, the cost of its construction was
paid out of the general fund. There
fore, Aldermen Moeglein and Hall con
tended, the residents who want water
should be willing to stand the cost of
getting water connections. The coun
cilmen also objected on the grounds
that it would add another hydrant at
$50 per year. To this Alderman Brown
answered that the fact that the rates
charged for water service by the Wa
ter Power company are prohibitive
should be no reason for depriving the
people of the service. The high, rate
was permitted by some council years
ago, he said.
Alderman Brown told the council
that the library board had asked the
building committee of the council in
regard to the construction of a con
crete underground coalbin for the li
brary, large enough to hold about 40
tons of coal. The building committee
was instructed to investigate tne mat
ter and report at a later meeting.
A letter from Mrs. S. Zimmerman of
fering to take care of the firemen's
room at the city hall and to wash the
towels, for $20 per month, was laid on
the table. The •council was of the opin
ion that the work
oi
Mrs. Stedler is
highly satisfactory.
The city engineer was instructed to
prepare plans and specifications for

supervised playground at the Central
school grounds will be opened for the
first time and will be under the super
vision of Petrus Liljedahl, who has
been engaged as Supervisor ox Recrea
tion by the Civic league. Children 6
to 11 years of age will have the use
of the grounds from 9 to 11 each ay
and the older pupils from 3 to 5:30 p.
m. The playgrounds will not be open
for the older pupils until Monday af
ternoon, June 19, however, in order
that ijiore of the apparatus may be
completed and set up first.
The opening of the playgrounds at
this time was made possible by a pri
vate donation, and the school board's
engaging Mr. Liljedahl to prepare the
apparatus.
In a letter recently received Dr.
Raymond Philan of the social econom
ics department of the university con
gratulates Little Falls on the fact that
it is to have supervised play and adds,
"I am delighted that you have found
a good local leader and that you did
not overlook him to seek an outsider.
Little Falls, in this respect as well as
in its playground promotion, itself is
setting a good example. The super
vised playground is a human necessity.
It is a most profitable public invest
ment, paying large dividends in the
form of healthy human beings and
good citizens. Put your money into
supervised plav now, and thus* avoid
future investment in reformatories and
prisons.''
