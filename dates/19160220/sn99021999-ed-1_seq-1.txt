TWO OF THEM ARE KILLED
NEW YORK. Feb. 19. An ex
plosion in a subway being con
structed 100 feet below the surface
of the East river today, shot three
workmen through mud and water to
the surface of the river, killing two
outright. One was rescued.
Details as to the nature of the ex
plosion were lacking, but it was re
ported to have been due to com
pressed air. The men were working
In an air lock and it is believed that
the shield which protected them gave
way.
Two Men Lose Llrea.
There were four men working- In an
air chamber at the time. The explosion
caused the eruption of a geyset In the
river thirty feet In height. Small boats
put out to the scene rescued one of
the workmen alive and ' recovered the
body of a second.
The subway under construction la
routed from the foot of Montague street,
Brooklyn, to White Hall street. New
York. The air chamber In which the ac
cident occured waa a short distance
from the Brooklyn shore. The workmen
were employed in mining operations.
About fortv other workmen were in
other sections of the tube, but the com
pressed air apparatus prevented an in
rush of the river and they escaped In
safety.

Prevent Posting- of Libel Notice
by Marshal of Federal
Government
GERMAN LIEUTENANT SUBMITS
Notice of Seizure Eemaim Posted on
Mast After American Gives
Warning;.
WATCHMEN ARE IN CHARGE
NORFOLK, Vs., Feb. 19. When
Deputy United States Marshal West
reached the Appam this morning to
seize it under admiralty proceedings
filed in the United States court here
by the British owners, Lieutenant
Berg attempted to prevent the pos
ing of the libel notice.
Deputy West stated his mission
and was taken to Lieutenant Berg's
quarters. The latter at once objected
to the proceedings:
"If I had known you were the
United 8tates marshal," he said, "I
would not have allowed you aboard."
The personal process was served
and the deputy then started to tack
the usual libel notice on the mast
of the vessel. The Oerman com
mander objected strenuously.
"The ship is In charge of Collector
Hamilton," he said, "and you havo no
right here."
Lieutenant Berg then left tha Appam
hurriedly and went to Newport News to
telephone.- When he returned Deputy
West had tacked on the mast of the ship
the slip of , white paper which certified
that tho Appam had been seised by or
der of the United States district court
at Norfolk. Lieutenant Berg directed his
men to tear It-down,
Deputy West commando him not to
touch -the notice and it remained on the
mast. Deputy West left two watchmen
In' charge of the vessel and tho rest of
tka party returned to Norfolk,
rioyd Hughes, local counsel for the
libellnnts, said all - Information concern
ing the, case had come from Mr. Coud
eit In New York, counsel for tha Ap
pam's owners. It la understood hero;
however, that tbe libellants base their
cae upon the provisions of the Prussian
American treaty under . which the Ger
man government claims that In order to
claim the benefit ot tho neutral port tha
prise must. h&yo been convoyed in by a
warship.' This Was not dona In tbe case
-tapers in tte action upon whl.h tho Ap
psm was selsed. wero filed In t" United
State district ceurt at Norfolk FWuary
1, but WerS wllhhheld from the public.
The owners allege "that the said Steam
ship la wrongfully withheld from tho
libellants by one Hans Berg and other
peraor unknown to ths libellants.'.' They
further allege that the Appam "on or
about the' 16th of January was unlaw
fully seised by certain persons unknown
to the libellants and thereafter,- under
compulsion, forced to proceed with pas
sengers, crew and cargo to Hampton
Roads."
Collector Hamilton's report to Wash
ington concerning the departure of
Deputy West with some thirty men was
made on unofficial Information. The
deputy was accompanied by only four
men. Mr. West. It Is said, did not con
fer with Collector Hamilton. Tho col
lector has protested against the alleged
failure of the marshal to co-operate with
the collector's office.

Wind-Up of Harris Case
Is Order for Perjury Inquiry
After the jury's verdict for the defendant In the case of Harris
against The Bee, was rendered, these proceedings were had In open court:
Mr. Victor Rosewater: Your Honor, I would like to present a mat
ter here, as soon as the Jury leaves the room, with your permission.
(The Jury retire into Jury room for coats and hats.)
I do this as an entirely . Independent action and without consulting
my attorneys.
While the outcome of this case Is very gratifying to me as one
of the defendants, I feel, that, in Justice to the Jury, to myself and
to this court, this matter, which has put In direct conflict the testimony
of this woman against the array of witnesses, which were brought here
by us, should be looked into further with reference to the question
whether she is not guilty of perjury and her husband guilty of suborna
tion of perjury. I ask you to order or request, the county attorney to
look Into this matter. The attorneys for the woman herself said that if
this verdict came in in this way It would be branding ber as a liar and
a perjurer and that she would be guilty of perjury; and the question of
whether others are guilty of subornation of perjury, I think should bo
looked Into also. .
I have no ill will again these people whatever. I do this and ask
you to do this purely for tho public good.. This woman and her husband
coma here strangers and, after going away, come back and within, a few
days start Hults and .follow them up with other suits (.gainst a great many
people and put' this county to a tremendous expense, put in 9 to tblt
cj peuse (and tha others who are defendants In these cases), which .1 Am
perfectly willing to bear if I can show, up Iblr scheme and the general
system of blackmail that is being
lawyers, not' necessarily at their Instigation, but through them, to force
people to settle suits brought without any warrant whatever.' And I ask
again and request that the county attorney be directed to look Into this
matter before these people get out ot town. ' v .
Mr. BlaEfer: (One of the attorneys of record for Mrs. Harris.) I think
that Mr. ' Rosewater's statement is not exactly apropos In this case.- I
don't believe, in asking the court to take this matter up. It he thinks
be has anything he ought to place the thing before the grand Jury or the
county attorney. I think this speech before the jury is casting an In
sinuation against us. I know this
I don't; be has thought be was conferring a favor upon me by so doing.
And I think all that has taken place up to this time Is an insinuation,
which goes personally to me and to Mr. Sawtelle, as well as Mr. Brome.
And they are not here.' And I think
against them when they are not here is unwarranted, as also I believe
Is their statements in regard to the entire matter. We have taken cases where
perhaps our clients are not entitled
case we have to conduct it until we find out ourselves. We don't know
otherwise but wbat our clients are entitled to damages; tbey may or
may not. Here the Jury has found they are not. We are willing to abide
by that verdict. Nevertheless I think
unwarranted and unauthorized.
The court: (Judge Graves..
preferred ta.bave been brought to the attention of some resident judge.
I am here as a stranger to the conditions locally and In the county. But
It would not come amiss to direct the county attorney to make an Inves
tigation, of the record in this case and If in bis Judgment be deems that
a prosecution should be brought tor
