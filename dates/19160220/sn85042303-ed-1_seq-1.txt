CHASED EQUIPMENT.
A. A. Bagwell, supei intendent of
the Springer school, was an Ardmore

is most progressive.
Springer had the first free night
school in the county. It opened last
(year and spelling, penmanship and
'arithmetic were taught. The school
has a Victrola, and is the first school

LOCAL DEALERS HAVE TROUBLE
IN SUPPLYING THE DEMAND ES
PECIALLY FOR CHEAP AND
MODERATE PRICED CARS.
In a few years at the present rate
of auto sales, a horse will be a scarce
animal in the City of Ardmore. The
local dealers In all lines report that
their sales are Increasing all the time
and It is a questljn of getting enough
cars to supply the demand that is
worrying them. This especially ap
plies to cheap and moderate priced
cars.
Yesterday one dealer gave an order
tor two car loads of machines to be
shipped here immediately, this deal
alone entailed a C. O. D. shipment of
over $7,000.
