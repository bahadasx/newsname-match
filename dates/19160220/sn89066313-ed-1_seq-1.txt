n ording to Mr Lipscomb, the cltj's
books hae not been audited for about
fhe j ears It is merely as a matter
of business, he said, that the work is
bi ing done. In his opinion Hie books
should be gone over at least every

Secrecj prevails as far as the water

d A V I'a-Iej . secretarj of the de

aiij lung about the audit.
Major Batterton said that the books
were being audited because it was good

SETS A WILD MARK
Floyd Makes New Indoor
Pole-Vault Record, 12
Feet 8 1-4 Inches.
Add another world's record man to
the athletes of the I'niversity of Mis
souri! F. W. C'l'rof.") Flojd of Miami,
Okla , for tlyee jears a member of the
Tiger track team, jesterday afternoon
leaped 12 feet 8 inches in Rothwell
Gjmnasium, thereby breaking the
world's indoor record for the pole
vault. The records for the indoor vault
are not clear, but none of the author
ities give the mark any higher than
Flojd's feat. It is most generally
agreed that the world's mark is 12
feet 5 inches.
Flojd, while not eligible for the
Tiger team, has been practicing all
j ear. Steadily his form has been im
proving and about a week ago he
startled track followers by clearing
the bar at 12 feet, 4 inches.
Yesterday afternoon the bar was
raised inch after inch as Floyd cleared
it in his best form. Finally the
standards were placed on chairs.
Flojd made another try and a world's
record was shattered.
RELIEVES HOTEL MILL PAY
.Major Hatterton Thinks Iloone Tavern
Good Business Proposition.
That the new hotel will be a perma

ness for the other hotels hj attracting
rew trade Is the opinion of Major J.
M. Batterton.
"People have been afraid a big hotel
wouldn't paj but I see no reason why
the invesient will not pay 5 or C per
cent," said JIaj'or Batterton jesterdaj'.
"The interest on the $20,000 bonus
Columbia is raising will amount to $1,
100 a j-ear, or more than $100 off the
rent each month.
"I like the name of Daniel Boone
Tavern. It's just like Ed Stephens
sa'd. People over the country will
think Boone was born, reared and
buried here."
