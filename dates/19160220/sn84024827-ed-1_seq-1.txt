amendment would provide for free

STRIKE DEMAND
American Bras3 Company will

ANSONIO. Conn., Feb. 19. The Am
erican Brass Company declined to
Brant the principal demands of its
twenty-five hundred striking employ
es, after a long conference. It is re
ported that the Italian laborers virtu
ally diverted the main body of strik
ers. The strikers urged a fifty-five
ho'tr week with sixty hours pay and
an increase of five cents an hour for
all men. The company is willing to
pay the men an increase of two and
a hr.lf cents an hour.
The Italians regnrd the offer favor
ably but the others hold out for the
Anginal demands. The police heard
rumors that Elizabeth Guerley Flynn,
of Pater'ion. N. J., and Joseph Ettor,
"Sndiisfnal Workers of the World, were"
coii.mg liere to'oranize the strikers.
Warrants were drawn up pirainst
Flynn and Ettor by the officials to

Popular Alderman From First
Ward Declares He Will Not
Accept Renomination. Mr.
Adams Being Forced In.
Charles Cunningham, at present al
derman from the first ward, and. one
of the most conscientious members
that body ever had on its membership
threw a bomb shell into the ranks of
his friends yesterday when he flatly
refused to be considered a candidate
to succeed himself. To make it strong
er, Cunningham declared he would re
fuse to serve.
The first nard councilman has been
extremely active since his election. On
every question and on every issue he
has stood out strong. In some cases
he has incurred the enmity of the peo
dle of the city but in all cases his
fearlessness and his singleness of pur
pose the good of Bisbee has carried
him through.
Cunningham has been mentioned as
!a possible nominee of the Democratic
! party for Mayor. This he absolutely
refuses to consider. He, moreover.
oeciarea ne was inrouga wun uiw
council as a member of it when his
present term expires. Some hav
thought he would accept if he were
pressed. They will be fooled in their
hypothesis.
Mayor Adams will probably be an
aspirant for the same work, during tha
next two years. He says he doesn't
want the nomination: that it will hurt
his chances for the Governorship.
S-vre of his friends, thinking they can
sidetrack Adams from the governor
ship race and thus aid Governor Hunt,
are urging him to become a candidate
for Mayor again. Apparently they fig
ure that if Adams is successful again
he will be out of Hunt's way and if he
is beaten he could not longer consider
himself of sufficient strength to fight
Hunt and his machine.
Just exactly what will happen, as
far as the democratic nomination for
Mayor is concerned, will be watched
with considerable interest by local pol
iticians. Still there appears no opposition to
James Allison, at least in the Demo
cratic primaries, and the people of
Bisbee are, as yet, chiefly concerned
with Democratic primaries for the Re
nublicans have not made a ripple on
the surface though there is plenty of
gossip about their Intentions.
One of the most interesting races
will be that, in the. Democratic primar
ies, between C. A. Bailey and A. E.
Shepherd. Both men have strong fol
lowings and both have a host of per
sonal friends. Both are . competent'
en and their various friends are
working hard for their respective sides

Instead of that the auto driver
swerved to the right, trying to
keep from colliding with the boy,
and struck him. The car was
slopped, the boy and his bicycle
being pinned between the auto and
a telephone pole on the north side

WASHINGTON. Feb. 19. Reports
to the Bureau of Navigation show thu'
American shipyards are crowded with
work as never before in their history,
and are refusing rontrarts calling for
new types of vessels, confining their
construction to those types for which
the plans already have been drawn.
With two hundred and thirty merch
ant vessels, with a total tonnage of
j 1,000.000. building or about to be start
'ed the United States is now being out
stripped in construction only by Eng
. land. Navigation experts see in th
I boom the prospect that the country
"may rerover the position it held before
the Civil war when it was the fore
most nation in ship building.
The amount of tonnage in American
; yards has doubled in the last year. It.
has inrrensed nearly fifty per cent
since December 1. and yards are so
filled with orders that many have
work to keep' them busy well into
1917. The Navigation Bureau's inves
tigation revealed the fact that much
larger vessels are under construct'.' n ,
than in previous years.

Funds ; Some Taxation May
be Doubled. Big Outlay.
WASHINGTON. Feu. ID. Proposal
! to amend the income tax law so as to
i include smaller incomes is certain to
be abandoned in favor of an increas
: ing rate for those already taxes, ac
' cording to Democratic House leaders.
; Sentiment against lowering the ex
emption limit to provide additional
revenue for preparedness crystallized,
it was said, in the Democratic caucus
Thursday when Leader Kitchin de
clared against changing the present
minimum of $3,000.
Since then . protestants against all
reduction plans have been more out
spoken daily. Leaders declared that
virtually the entire preparedness rev
enue burden would be met with inrome
taxed. Tentative bills proposing to
raise $100,000,000 solely by an ln-
creased income tax rate are being dis
I cussed and will be offered soon in
committee.
1 One of the Democratic leaders, who
; will be active in framing the adminis
tration bill said he would suggest doub
ling the present ouo per cent rata -(
incomes below l'n,(i00 and possibly
make the' tax above tiiat amount as
' high as eight per cent . He also sug
gested lowering the minimum in
come subjec t to one per cent to $15,000
he said. Under this plan, married men
mould be given the advantage of an
additional $1.00 exemption as in the
present law. It is generally under-
; stood that the preparedness program
will call for about $93,000.1)00 expen
diture the first year.
