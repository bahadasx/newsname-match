E. M. FORD SHOOTS
WIFEMSELF
Assistant in Telegraph Division.
War Department, Commits
Double Crime.
COUPLE HAD SEPARATED;
BOTH NOW NEAR DEATH
Shooting Takei Place in Wife'i
Apartment While Nine-Year-Old
Son Is Asleep Nearby.
Edward M. Ford, forty-three years
old, assistant chief of the telegraph
division, War Department, last night
shortly after 11 o'clock ehot his wife,
Mrs. Ella Ford, and himself.
The shooting occurred in his wife's
apartment on the fourth floor of the
St. George apartment house, 20th and
J- streets northwest. Both were hurried
to Emergency Hospital, where, it
was said, their condition was critical
and but little hope was held out for
the recovery of either.
Two bullets wounded each of them.
One bullet entered the wife's head and
the other penetrated the stomach.
Ford's bullets lodged dangerously near
the heart.
Edward Richard Ford, nine years old,
son of the couple, was asleep in the
apartment when the shooting occurred,
and a daughter. Helen, sixteen years
old, was at a dance. When she returned
home her parents had been taken to
the hospital and her brother was being
cared for in the apartment of A. J.
Arrington.
Separated for Some Time.
The Fords / had been separated for
some time, it is stated, and as long ago
as last summer, the wounded man told
Detective O'Brien, at the hospital the
morning, he purchased the pistol for
the purpose of killing a man. He e*pcted
to do the killing at Union station,
he said, but the other man did
not appear. He admitted to the detective
that he shot his wife and tried
to commit suicide, and some of his
fellow workers at the War Department
had heard that he recently had indulged
in threats to do just what he
did last night.
It was said at the War Department
last night that Ford had been drinking
during the past several days and that
he had been given a severe lecture and
warned that his position would not be
secure unless he quit drinking. v
The little son of the couple wa;\ine
only person, with the exception ol
victims, who was able to give a c hr
account of what happened in ?/de
apartment preceding the shooting.
"Papa came around early and took
me to the movies," he said, "but he
didn't stay until it was over, and when
he went home mamma was looking out
the window. Papa asked her what
she was looking out the window for,
and she said that was her pleasure."
W? willlB VW XSggUlg*
Edward, continuing his story, said
he went to bed and knew nothing more
until he felt some one tugging at him.
"And /when I looked in," he said, "I
saw it was mamma, and her face was
covered witn Diooa.
The child heard none of the shots, he
said, and he hardly knew how he
reached the Arrington apartment.
Members of the Arrington family
heard the shots, and one of the daughters
called to her father, who was
asleep, to get up, telling him Mrs. Ford
had been shot.
"And when I got to the door," said
Mr. Arrington. "I saw Mrs. Ford
crawling through the hall toward my
apartment."
Wants Boy Protected.
"Mr. Arrington, he's killing me," called
.Mrs. Ford a number of times. "Don't
let him kHl my boy."
Ford, with the boy clasped In his
arms, was rolling about on the kitchen
floor of his wife's apartment when Arrington
looked in there to get an idea
of the situation. Soon after the boy
had been taken to the Arrington apartment,
where he displayed much affection
for his mother. Ford came to the
door and asked to be admitted.
Mrs. Ford, hearing her husband's
voice, became nervous and begged that
he be prevented from killing her baby
i Kd ward).
Policeman Holz of the third precinct
was the first officer to reach the scene
nr the shooting, ana close behind him
were Sergt J. Wlllard Greene and Precinct
Detective William E. Smith.
"Why did you do this?" one of the
officers asked Ford.
"I don't know." he replied. 'Tib going,
and I want to tell 'Buddy* good-bye. I
hope God will forgive me for what I've
done."
Harried to Hospital.
An ambulanee was summoned,, and the
wounded couple were hurried to Emergency
Hospital. Detective Patrick
O'Brien, who was acquainted with the
parties to the affair, went to the hospital
and saw the husband. The wounded man
extended his hand and told him he had
done the shooting. He further told of
tiiv |iu> >. XIMIO vt. I.UQ ?co>(n/i)| wra >J*plalned
why he had purchased it.
At the War Department Ford was
rated as expert telegrapher, and It was
known that he had been separated from
his wife for some little time. He occupied
a room a few squares from where
his family occupied the apartment and,
it is stated, paid frequent visits to the
apartment, providing for his family
and occasionally taking "Buddy." as
the boy was called, to see the moving
pictures.
Mrs. Ford's brother, the late Michael
l,eech. was in the saloon business near
20th and M streets northwest for a
number of years, and ahe has a number
of relatives living In that section of
the eit>
Other persons residing in the apartment
bouse, it is stated, were not
aware of the threats the husband was
said to have made, and there was no
lomi talking beard in the apartment
b? fore the shooting occurred, although,
the police say, husband and wife probabl;.
engaged in a lengthy conversation
before the shooting, the husband

reconciliation.

Arrest I. T. T. Lincoln on the
Streets in New York
City.
SEVERAL WEEKS' SEARCH
WINDS UP ON BROADWAY
After Escaping Deputy Marshal. He
Went About Freely Disguised
as a Farmer.
NEW YORK, February 19?Ignatius T.
T. Lincoln, former member of the British
parliament and self-confessed German
spy, who escaped January 15 from the
custody of a United States deputy marshal
after his arrest here August 4, 1915,
at the instigation of the British government,
was rearrested at 7 o'clock tonight
in front of a Broadway restaurant. He
was taken to the offices of the Department
of Justice, where he was questioned behind
closed doors for more than two
hours. Later he was removed to Raymond
street jail in Brooklyn, where he
had formerly been a prisoner.
Lincoln declared his capture was due
to the fact that the proprietor of a
lodging house where he had engaged
quarters learned his identity and attempted
to extort $250 from him in return
for the surrender of his baggage.
He declined tn make a statement to
newspaper men, but asserted to the officers
who questioned him that he never
would have "run away if the United
States government, which was aware of
attempts of the British government to
persecute him, had treated him fairly."
Made Mistake About Trunks.
In the absence of Capt. William M.
Offley, chief of the local investigation
of the Department of Justice, what Lincoln
said to the authorities here after
his arrest was not officially made public.
Beyond the announcement that he
had been taken in custody by Special
Agents John J. Grurevich and Niels
Chalmers, no information was forthcoming
regarding his arrest.
"You people never in the world would
have caught me," he declared, "if I
hadn't made a mistake about my trunks.
I think the people where I had the
trunks recognised me several days ago,
and notified you, so that when I went
back there today you were waiting for
me. I made a serious mistake in going
back."
While being questioned by Mr. Dunham
and the secret service agents. Lincoln
became angry and protested in
loud tones that the United States government
had not treated him fairly or
he would not have run away.
"The Washington officials know what
is behind this persecution,"* he was
heard to say. "This is nothing but a
political affair, but still they didn't
treat me fairly. I wouldn't have run
AWW if they had, but JL am only human.
ril be game, though. I'll take
coming to me."
Arrested by Baltimorean.
The government agent who arrested
Lincoln is attached to the Baltimore
office of the secret service and has been
working on the case since Lincoln escaped.
When he saw the fugitive on the
street tonight the detective decided to
take no chances. He pressed a revolver
against Lincoln's body and advised
him to submit to arrest quietly.
"You needn't do that," said Lincoln,
smilingly. "I'll go along with you
quietly enough."
After his escape, Lincoln told his
questioners, he went to South Ambody,
X. J., where he disguised himself as a
farmer and Vent about with no fear
of his identity being learned. He made
frequent trips to Xew York and rented
a room in the vicinity of the spot
where he was arrested.
After Lincoln had been questioned at
length he was taken to the Raymond
street jail in Brooklyn for the night.
Still handcuffed and guarded by two
United States deputy marshals as well
as by two detectives, he was given into
the custody of United States Marshal
Power of the eastern district of New
York, from which he had escaped.

$7,500,000 to the relief
of Belgium, according to E.
Van De Vyvere, Belgian

LIEUT. BERG THREATENS
TO TEAR DOWN NOTICE
Commander's Defiance of American
Officer Followed by Compliance
With patter's Orders.
NORFOLK, Va.. February 19.?Federal
Judge Waddill issued the usual
libel process today, and the Appam was
seized by a deputy United States marshal.
who went to Newport News on a
tug for the purpose. Two guards from
the office of the Unked States district
court were left in charge of the Appam.
Deputy West, accompanied only by
Attorney Bullowa, of counsel for the
company: A. G. Bailey of the office of
Castner, Curran & Bullitt, agents for
the owners, and two watchmen, left
Norfolk this morning on the tug Mascot
about 9 o'clock. The party reached
the side of the Appam about 11:30
o'clock. The ladder was up. Deputy
West went out on deck while the rest
of the party remained in the pilot
house, and directed that the ladder be
lowered, as he wished to come aboard.
He did not state his business. The
ladder was lowered according to his
wishes and the entire party went
aboard the vessel.
Lieut. Berg Objects.
Deputy West then stated his mission
and directed that he be taken to the
captain. When the United States officer
was conducted to Lieut. Berg's quarters
the latter at once objected to the
proceedings.
"Had I known you were the United
States marshal," he said, "I would not
have allowed you aboard."
Deputy West paid no attention to
Lieut. Berg's objections, and proceeded
about the usual process of serving a
libel.
Lieut. Berg objected at every step.
The personal prbcess was served, and
the deputy then started to tack the
usual notice on the mast of the vessel.
The German commander objected
| strenuously. "The ship is in charge of
Collector Hamilton," ne said, "ana you
have no right here."
Lieut. Berg then left the Appam hurriedly
and went to Newport News to
telephone. Whether he telephoned to
Collector Hamilton or the German embassy,
or to whom, is not known; but
when he returned to the Appam, shortly
afterward. Deputy West had tacked
the notice on the mast of the ship.
Lieut. B?ff l||n directed his men to
tear down the Viip of white paper which
told that the Appam had been seised by
order of the United States district court
at Norfolk.
Notice Remains on Mast.
"Don't you touch that notice," said
the United States marshal, and the notice
remained on the mast.
Deputy West then departed from the
ship, leaving the two watchmen, who
had been sworn in this morning, in
charge of the vessel. The rest of the
party returned to Norfolk. The deputy
was all smiles. He is leaving tonight
for New Haven, Conn., where he
is to be married Monday.
Floyd Hughes, local counsel for the
libelants, refused to discuss the case
today, saying that all information concerning
the case should come from Mr.
Coudert in New York, who is leading
counsel for the owners of the Appam.
It is understood here, however, that
me UDeiants Dase ineir case upon the
provisions of the Prussian-American
treaty, under which* the German government
claims that, in order to claim
the benefit of the neutral port, the
prize must have been convoyed in by
a warship. This was not done in the
case of the Appam. /
Papers Filed February 16.
Papers in the action upon which the
Appam was seized were filed In the
United States district court at Norfolk
February 16, but were kept from the
public for obvious reasons. The
owners allege In the libel "that the
said steamship is wrongfully withheld
from the libelants by one Hans Berg
libelants." They further allege that
the Appam "on or about the 16th of
January was unlawfully seised by
certain persons unknown to the libelants,
and thereafter under compulsion
forced to proceed with passengers,
crew and cargo, to Hampton roads."
Collector Hamilton's report to
Washington concerning the departure
of Deputy United States Marshal West
with some thirty men. It was learned
late today, was made as a result of
unofficial information coming to the
collector, with whom the deputy
marshal, it Is said, did not consult after
Collector Hamilton Intimated that
the deputy marshal might better not
proceed 'aboard the Appam until the
collector could advise his department
of the sudden action and the marshal's
Intentions.
Protest by Collector.
Collector Hamilton, it is said, has
made vigorous protest against the action
of the marshal in proceeding
without what is termed proper cooperation
with the collector's office.
Collector Hamilton, it is asserted, has
especially protested against Deputy
West proceeding to serve the writ he
held, accompanied by an attorney for
the libellant, when the collector requested
the deputy marshal to defer
his action temporarily until the collector
could ascertain what action. If
any. the collector's office could rightfully
take.

EXPLOSION IN SU

NEW YORK, February 19.missing
as the result of a compre
subway under construction too it

water to the surface of the river,
recovered after removal to a hospit
been caused by a leak in the compi
to stabilize the work under con
thirty-five other men working in
One Oeto Through Alive.
The man killed was Frank Driver,
and the missing: workman is John McCarthy,
both described as "miners."
With Marshall Mabey, a helper, they
were sent sky-rocketing: up through
the roof of the tunnel, into the Icy
water. Witnesses on the water front
declared the three men were hurled
fully thirty feet above the surface of
the river.
Rescuers who put out from shore
found Driver still alive. He died, however,
before ne could be taken to land.
Mabey appeared only slightly injured,
while no trace was found of McCarthy.
It was learned tonight that much difficulty
has been experienced in constructing
the new subway, owing to
the presence of great quantities of
sliding gravel and mud. Many slides
have occurred, it was said, but despite
this fact the work has been pushed
with greater rapidity than in any subway
thus far constructed in this city, i
Men Heeded Warning:.
Seven of the thirty-eight men immediately
affected by the explosion were
working in what is known as the
"head" of the subway erecting beams
and otherwise making ready to extend
the tunnel. There had been no blasting
since early morning, so when a
thick mist appeared in the tube it was
regarded as sufficient warning that
a competent tribunal not only for
guidance in the present case but as a
precedent for the future.
No Formal Action Yet.
The department, in the absence of
such a precedent, has held tentatively
that tne Appam is a German prize, tout
never has passed formally upon Germany's
request that the vessel be allowed
to remain indefinitely in American
waters. A reply to that request
now is in course of preparation, and
indications have been that it would be
granted- It was said yesterday, however,
that the response might wait
until the prize court'had acted.
It was suggested that under the treaty
of 1828 "German prizes in American ports
are exempt from such legal processes |
as that served 011 the Appam yesterday,
but in reply officials pointed out that j
the State Department has not yet offl- j
daily fixed the status of the vessel. |
There is no disposition to question the
jurisdiction of the court in any case involving
the construction of a treaty,
. though the State Department takes the
ground that it is still at liberty to deal
diplomaticallM with the case in its own
way while the court proceedings are
going on.
To Develop British Position.
On their face the libel papers indicate
that the suit so far is purely a private
one and that neither the British government
nor the State Department, at least
at this stage, has any direct interest in
it. The attorneys prosecuting the suit,
however, are expected to develop fully
the position of the British government
in regard to the right of the American
government to allow its ports to be made
places of refuge for prizes.
Some exceedingly intricate points of
international law are expected to bs developed
by tha British attorney*

WEST SEES DISCORD

Republicans of That Section
Resent New York Attitude
in Presidential Race.
Western republicans in Congress are
nueh perturbed over what they term
he domineering attitude of New York
n the presidential contest. Especially
lo they look down^their nose over the
/aunt of William Barnes, jr., that he
vill go west and accelerate the Root
>oom.
They say that if there is one thing
leceasary to interrupt the present tendency
toward harmony between the facions
In the west it would be William
Sarnes coming out to "tell them where
;o get off." They add that if he could
>ring along Boies Penrose, Lou Payne
ind the shade of Thomas C. Piatt the
entourage would be complete?comeletely
disastrous to all attempts at
jet together.
"Confined to Beaten Track."
In the opinion or these western "remblicans,
the only trouble with Mr.
3arnes is that he confines his itinerary
o the beaten track between the Albany
21ub in his own home town and the
tepublican Club in New York city, and
f he should ever start to go west of
he Pompelian room in the Annex Hoel
in Chicago he would "probably
hink he'd orter wear leather breeches
ind spurs for local color."
But, all joking aside, these western
epublicans say the recent developments
n republican politics in New York have
ubbed them the wrong way. Things
rere going along pretty well in the

Necessity of Consolidating
Local Traction Lines.

Preiident of Washington Railway
and Electric Company Addresses
Federation of Citizens.
Employing the text, "Let's Talk It
Over and Be Fair About It," Clarence
P. King-, president of the Washington
Railway and Electric Company, In an
Informal talk last night before the
Federation of Citizens* Associations on
public utility questions, sounded the
keynote of a campaign to be immediately
launched by that body for greater
co-operation between citizens and the
utility corporations in improving the
services furnished by them.
Concrete suggestions offered by Mr.
King for relieving street railway congestion
and bringing about other improvements
in the functioning of the
various utilities are to be investigated
by the utilities committee of the feda
Intn hrlnc
in a program of recommendations at an
early date.
The whole Idea of the plan is to enable
the public to understand better the problems
of the companies and the utilities
to get a better grasp of the viewpoint of
their patrons?to work out as far as possible
by co-operative methods the differences
of opinion without attempting
to adjust them at arm's length through
the formal channels of protest and complaint.
The committee, by a unanimous vote,
was instructed to confer not only with
Mr. King, but with the heads of other
local public service corporations, and to
submit a program of co-operation which,
if popularly subscribed to, will lead to
improvements in service that ordinarily
would be sought by administrative and
legislative means.
Mr. Xing'* Address.
Mr. King referred briefly to some of
toe methods that might be employed for
relieving congestion on the traction
lines. Abolishment of , compulsory Are
stops, establishment of skip-stops during
the rush hours, readjustment of express
service and other features were
touched upon.
Most significant of his statements,
however, was the declaration that the
basis of future development of Wash*
ington's street railway lines must be
the consolidation of all the traction
lines operating in the District and the
electric power company. Consolidation,
he declared, offers tne olflf meant
of financing extensions and rearranging
trackage so as to meet the traffic
problems of the future.
nis views in mm respect airesay imvo
received the indorsement of the federation,
which, at a recent meeting, adopted
a resolution favoring consolidation
of the street railways, aild also suggested
universal transfers. In his address
last night Mr. King stated that
the consolidation project had been
recommended to Congress by a former
board of*Commissioners, and that it
offers the only feasible solution of the
vital problems of the local traction
situation.
Jn urging the federation and the public
to consider this situation from the
standpoint of the companies and "be
fair about it," Mr. King went into the
details of the development of the
Washington Railway and Electric Company.
He stated that during the thirteen
years it has been in existence this
company has spent $17,000,000 in the
betterment of its property, exclusive of ,
operating expenses.
Called "Cheapest Necessity."
The speaker produced figures to show
that utility service is about the cheap,
est necessity in Washington. Since
1896, it was shown, the cost of coal has
advanced 50 per cent; servants' wages,
50 per cent; food. 33 per cent, and
clothing. 33 per cent, while the cost of
electric service nas decreased 60 per
cent. Only about 2*6 per cent of the
average annual income of $1,000 is
spent for electricity, and yet this and
other utilities are the most strictly
regulated, whereas there is no regulation
of the commodities for which the
bulk of the income is spent, he pointed
out. w
The railway head said that street 1
car service here is cheap in comparl- 1
son with other eastern cities, the majority
of which have straight 5-cent '
fares, and this in addition to the fact
that in most municipalities the wires '
are overhead instead of underground.
Defending the practice of maintaining
a $1 minimum charge 'for electric
service, Mr. King said this cost barely
meets the monthly expense of looking
after the meter. If our 28,000 customers
didn't use any electricity and
merely paid the minimum charge of $1
a month the company would be forced
into bankruptcy, he asserted.
Burdens Borne by Companies. *
The heavy burden borne by the railway
companies in paying- the salaries of
crossing policemen?a system that does
not obtain in any other city, and which,
he declared, should be a government expense?was
discussed at length. It was
stated that since this law went into
effect the railway companies have paid
to the crossing policemen a' total of
$667,841.16. In 1910 the payment
amounted to $35,000 in round numbers;
in 1911. $37,000; 1912, $46,000, 1913,
$50,000 1914. $55,000; 1915. $57,000.
Reference was made to the fact that
Justice Siddons, at the time he was a
member of the board of Commissioners,
endeavored to have this expense taken
over by the city.
Discussing some of the methods by
which better service can be obtained,
Mr. King urged abolishment of the flre
stops, stating that the oars of the
Washington Railway and Electric Company
make 36,000 compulsory stops at i
these designated points each day, losing
a total of 200 hours of traveling ?
time. The utilisation of this time in
speeding up schedules is a possibility
wortny or senous consideration, ne
stated.
By establishing; a system of skipstops
during; the rush hours, so that
cars would stop at every other block
or certain designated blocks, considerable
improvement might be made in
the way of shortening schedules, the
speaker suggested.
