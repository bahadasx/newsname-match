that in states having no commission

An attempt also will be made bv
Senator Hustings to get into the bill

any power plant developed under
terms of the proposed law for the
purpose of manufacturing nitrates ex
plosives or for any other purpose

Senator La Follette's amendment
also would give the interstate com
merce commission authority over
leases in states which have no reg
ulatory authority, and would provide
for free leases to political substi
tute divisions of states, municipali
ties and state institutions operating
plants not for profit.
An amendment drafted by Senator
Norris would give the I'nited States
authority to take over plants after
expiration of grants upon six months'

would make the proposed law apply
to unnavigable streams whenever the
I'nited States enters upon their im
provement to make them navigable.

The department in the absence of

that, the Appam is a German prize, out
never has passed formally upon Ger
many's request that the vessel be al
lowed to remain indefinitely in l.r

now is jn cours- of preparation and

the suburban home of Mr. Boeing,

Tlie citation served on Hilton is re
