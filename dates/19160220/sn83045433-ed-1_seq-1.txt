Nw Ynrk. Feb. 19.-A man working
on a ecow in the East Iliver at 4 o'clock
this afternoon saw what looked like a
treat buhte break on the surface of
the water several feet away. Out of the
center of it appeared the figure of a

the tale. lie is at 1Broklyn IHospital, and

His surprising appearance was the re
sult of a blow-out in the new tube
which cost the lives of two of his fel
low-laborers. Another in the shield with
them wh, n the blow-out occ urred was
able to run back and escape.
The tunnel has progressed about 20

It is difficult to judge the air pres

over-pressure which caused this after
noon's accident.
Mabey was working with Frank Driver
and another "sand hog" named McCarthy
on the rim of the shield when symptoms
of a break appear-d. M. flottman. the
fourth man in the shield, was a few feet
behind them.
Before they could retreat, M bey.
Driver and McCarthy were engulfed in
the outrush of air and shot up through

Requests Appropriation for Anti-Air

Said $12,000,000 Was Stricken Out.
Fmerge.n.v appropriations of nearly
$3.am.o0 for pressing naval needs. in
cliding anti-aircraft guns for the fleet.
and submarine mines, were urged by
Secretary Daniels in a communilcation
sent to Congress yesterday.
The demand for additional funds for
these purposes camne as a comiplete sur
prise to Congress, for within the past
two weeks. Rear Admiral Straus, of the
Bureau of Ordnance, has told the IIouse
Naval Committee that Secretary Daniels
had arbitrarily stricken from his esti
mates for next year's appropriations, ap
proximately S2,000.000, including appro
priations for the very purposes asked for
in Secretary Daniels' letter yesterday.
The committee at that time was forced
to question Admiral Straus closely in
order to determine whether the estimates
had been cut. The admiral reluctantly
admitted that Secretary Daniels had
"lininated his recommendations, and that
the Secretary had not consulted with the
Ordnance Bureau before making the re
ductions.
Repairing Costs More.
The appropriations sought by the S&
retary yesterday were: Ordnance and
ordnance stores, $99..000; maintenance,
Bureau of Yards and Docks, $.2.t00; con
tingent expenses Bureau of Yards and
Docks, $85.000; repairs and preservation at
navy yards, $4.,000; construction and re
pair of vessels, $6000; engineering,
$900.00; a total of 2S,7i7,O000.
In his letter, Secretary Daniels ex
plained that since the adoption of the
general staff plan in keeping the fleet
in constant repair, without laying vessels
up for several months to be overhauled,
the expense of repairs had materially in
creased.

Lansing Tells Baron Zwiedinek
America Cannot Acquiesce
in Sub Policy.
SAYS MERCHANT VESS..S
HAVE FULL RIGHT TO ARM
State Department Must Have Pledge
That Ships Will Not Be Harmed
Without Warning.
Secretary of State Lansing ycsterday
told Baron Zwiedinek. the Austrian
charge d'affaires. that the United States
recognizes the right of merchant vessels
to arm for defensive purposes, and does
not acquiesce in the new submarine pol
icy announced by the Teutonic powers.
The notification given the Austrian
charge was the same as that given the
German Ambassador two days ago. Ba
ron Zwiedinck will cable his government
notifying it of the position officially an
nounced by the United States.
In negotiations arising from the sink
ing of the Italian vessel Ancona by the
Austrian submarine, the Austrian gov
ernment gave pledges to the United
States that Its submarine commanders
had been instructed since the beginning
of the war to comply with the Interna
tional law In submarine operations.
No pledge of future conduct in sub
marine operations have previously been
asked from Austria by the United States.
Such pledges now will be required.
The State Department takes the po
sition that the announcement of Ger
many and Austria that after February
29 they will instruct submarine comman
ders to sink armed enemy merchant ves
sels without warning nullifies all assur
ances previously given.
These earlier assurances were accept
ed by the United States as meaning that
passenger vessels would not be sunk un
less they resisted or attempted to es
ca pe.
The proclamation of Germany and
Aus~a, which refers to "armed mer
chantmen." does not make clear whether
the term includes passenger vessels. The
State Department assumes that it does.

New York, Fe b. 19.-Igtatus T. T
Lincoln, the self-confessed German ap' .
who escaped from the custody of a Fed
eral deputy marshal on January Is, arA
has since been openly defymng the I'nited
States officials, was recaptured tonight.
Four operatives of the Department of
Justice surprised Lincoln while he was
walking leisurely along Broadway at
Twenty-ninth street. One pressed a re
volver into the pit of Linto!n's stomach
and said:
"You're under arrest Lincot-.
Handcuffs were slipped on his wr..ts.
Instead of being crestfallen. L-ncoln
sneeringly remarked:
"I congratulate ,ou. Tou are extremely
clever. But T was given up because I
refused to pay tribute to a deputy mar
shal. I am going to see that the man
who betrayed me is prosecuted for black
mail."
Takes to Federal Buildig.
Lincoln was thrust into a taxicab and
taken to the Federa: Building, where he
was examined by members of the an
archist squad.
Me continued to taunt his captors.
Piecemeal his story was wormed from
.p. For-ote_ fma he has been living
i Red Bank. N. J. Just after his es
cape, he lived it an apartment In the
Bronx. where he left a trunk when he
moved to Red Bank. It was in quest
of this trunk, which the landlord re
fused to give up without cash payment
for a debt, that Linooln came to Man
hattan. Government officials were noti
fied, and he was trailed from t.e Bronx
to Broadway, where his capture o-currcd.
Carried No Weapon.
Lincoln dcnied that he escaped from l
a Brooklyn restaurant. That story wal
told, he says, to protect the marshal who
permitted him to escape. His flight.
he declared, began at the Hotel Knicker
bocker. whre. he says, he was frequently
permitted to visit.
"I would still be at liberty if I had
been willing to pay tribute to the dep
uty marshals," Lincoln declared boast
ingly. "I have been feeding them for
a long time and finally got tired of it.
Why, only a couple of days ago, one
of them came to Red Bank to see me.
He demanded that I give him $200. I
refused and he went away in a huff.
I didn't think he had the nerve to give
me up. but he did, and I was cap
tured."
Lincoln's real name is said to be
Isaac Trebitach. At one time he was
a member of the British Parliament.

special to The Washingtte Herald.
New York. Feb. 19.-"One of the most
diabolical massacres that ever too.. place
in history is going on in Turkey. It'
seems almost incredible that the human
mind could conceite or the heart per
petrate such awful slaughter as that to
which the Turks have resorted.'
This was the statement today of the
Rev. E. A. Yarrow, a Congregational mis
alonary recently returned from Van, Ar
menia. lHe recounted his escape and ex
periences to 2.. members of the alumni
of Mt. Hlermon School. the institution
founded by the late D. I.. Moody. at
Broadway Tabernacle.
"As an instance of their fiendish meth
ods, they left scores of babies to burn
alive in ovens under which raging fires
had been buIlt. The infants had been
wrenched from the arms of their help
less mothers, who were dragged away
with the fleeing Turks at the approach
of the Russian ar-my.
"One by one they sent out from a
hospital where their own wounded were
being tr-sated Armenian nurses, and shot
them to death in cold blood. A single
wounded Russian prisoner, too Ill to
be transported, was killed as he lay In
his cot rather than have him rescued by
his comarades.
