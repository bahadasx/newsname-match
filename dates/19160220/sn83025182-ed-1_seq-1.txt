A further batch of letters from Lieu
tenant Colonel Reber, head of the
aviation department, to Captain Ar

Diego and Cowan's answers were
made public by Robinson. He re
fused to tell how he got photographs
of the letters which supposedly are
records of the war department. In
case their authenticity is questioned,
however, he said. It will prove' they
are all right.
One letter, from Cowan to Reber,
tells of the former's desire for a mo
tor cycle and cited official reasons for
it.
"My personal reason,"the letter
reads, "for wanting this motor cycle,
is to provide myself with a means of
transportation between North Island
and my quarters at Coronado."
Another Cowan-to-Reber letter says
an automobile was necessary for the
cross-country flying work.
Robinson charges an eight cylinder
touring car was bought and used for
the personal convenionce of Captain
Cowan and his wife.
Another Reber-to-Cowan. which Rob
inson will cite as a proof of alleged
extravagance, concluded:
"I wiil let a few days more go by
and then blow in all the balance of
our appropriation."
In connection with alleged padding
of the number of flyers. Robinson
made public parts of two letters, pur
porting to be from Reber to Cowan,
as follows:

of a series of challenges to republi

favor intervention in uiexico and

WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.—What
ever the relations between the United
States and Germany may be, it be
came clear tonight that personal re
lations between Secretary of State
Lansing and Ambassador Bernstorff
are at the breaking point. Unless
there is an immediate change, Wash
ington has reason to expect that
BernstorfTs recall will be asked—the
Teutonic diplomat, in the language of
an angry official able to speak with
authority, will be shipped back
home."
The situation has arisen out of
what administration officials consider
deliberate and unfair publicity
methods of me ambassador. They
hold the German embassy responsible
for creating the impression that the
ITnited States has changed its atti
tude on suDmarine warfare. As ^e
best evidence that the stato depart
ment has not made such a change. It
is intimated, the ambassador is likely
to be declared persona non-grata and
his recall requested.
One result of the anger in official
quarters over what Is considered in
ternational misrepresentation, was to
bring to light, today for the first time
tne whole story of recent negotiations
between Lansing and Bernstorff. It
was revealed:
That the U. S. had advance know

LANSING AND BERNSTORFF
GROWLING AT EACH OTHER
In this connection the state depart
ment was greatly Interested in a dis
patch from Berlin in which Carl W.
Ackerman, United Press staff corres
pondent, told that officials there in
dicate Germany has salu her last
word regarding the Lu3itania matter.
Officials expressed the belief that
Berlin has recognized the blunder,
and is now seeking a way out of the
difficulty.
If this theory is true, it Is agreed
In Washington tonight the way out
probably will have to be found in
Berlin. The almost openly expressed
feeling toward the Gorman embassy,
it is believed, will make it hard for
an agreement to be reached between
the embassy and the state depart
ment. There is almost a unanimous
belief on the part of administration
officials that propaganda by the em
bassy Is making further negotiations
Impossible.
The personal feeling on Lansing's
part came to the top. It was said to
night, when he found It necessary to
deny a report that he intended to
resign. This report grew, it was be
lieved, out of intimations that he had
conceued the German position regard
ing armed merchantmen, but had
been overruled by the president. The
latter was an intimation denied
earlier in the week.
Constant suggestion that Germany
had been given assurance that the
U. S. would back her in the armed
merchantmen decree was the thing,
however, that resu.ted in the whole
story concerning this decree coming
to light. Administration officials con
sented to make known the secret
steps that has led up to the present
situation. The explanation follows:
Early in January Teutonic officials
intimated that a decree would soon
be issued ordering all submarine com
manders to slnl without warning any
armed ship. Changed conditions of
sea warfare, it was contended, made
changes In international law neces
sary. This, together with copies of
secret orders the British admiralty
was alleged to have issued to all ship
commanders, to resist any attempt to
torpedo and to sink all submarines,
led the state department to an admis
sion of the "reasonableness," of the
Teutonic attitude.
The state department made no
promises, but let it become known to
Teutonic diplomats that a modus Vi
vendi would be proposed.
This took the form of a suggestion
to all allied powers that merchant
ships be kept unarmed in uie intor-
