LAST VORO SAID
' 111 LUSITANIA CASE
Berlin, Feb. 19. Germany ha
said her last .word In the Lusltanta
case and Will not' prepare another
note about It, according to atrong In
dication among officials today.
Though they are not commenting
for publication on the report that
Secretary of State Lansing will not
recognise Germany' right to torpedo
armed merchant ships without warn
ing, the official attitude la known to
be:
Germany doea not ' believe . that
America should Interrogate her too
closely ' about how the' new policy
shall be enforced, a the method Is
a naval secret, which Germany re
gard as purely a military question
concerning ' only herself and her al
lies. Ambassador von Bernstorff ha
been fully Instructed about the Lust
tanla case, and he was permitted to
make the change In the proposed set
tlement which wo suggested In hi
recent conference with Lansing.
And again, officials declare that the
Lusltanla Incident waa really closed
at that conference and that the new
warfare plans have nothing to do
with that case. ,

Is decomposed granite, and the foun
dation for the factory will have to go
down to either the cement gravel that
underlies the soil, or at least to the
gravel strata that 1 found. It is ex
pected that the walla may have to go
down to a depth of five or six feet
to find firm foundation. .
A, augar factory uses a great deal
of water, and Mr. GUman says that
It Is probable that this will be pump

that a centrifugal pump might he

it could again be raised to the top

further raise of 40 feet, that being

BLUNDER 01
KAfSER IS BELIEF
AT
Washington, Feb! 19. That Ger
many has blundered in her decree of
war against armed enemy merchant
vessel and, realizing, it, Is now try
ing to find a way ont of her difficul
ties, was the interpretation put hpon
United Press Staff Correspondent
Ackerman's dispatch here today.
The fact that he revealed that Ger
many does not want to be questioned
too closely about the decree waa the
flrst word of how the Teutons view
America's refusal to acquiesce in the
decree. And. it is believed, th ntnrv
constituted a hint that despite the
utterances of the German' press, the
kaiser government recognizes It haa
placed Itself in a very awkward posi
tion.
Inasmuch as tAckerman did not
state that Germany will not recon
sider her decree, It la accepted here
as an Indication that Berlin may be
willing to yield to the United States,
but Is puzzled, how to do so without
raising an outcry in Germany. ' ' '
Though Secretary Lansing would
not comment upon the Ackerman dis
patch, another department official
aald: '. . ' -...
"Austria and Germany have blun
dered. They made a mistake in issu
ing the decree, which, In effect, is
an ultimatum. The principal effect
it has thus far Is to impair seriously
relations between the United States
and the central powers. At a time
when there was tome sympathy with
their Contention about rmed ships,
the Teutons Issued a decree to which
the United States could not possibly
accede. " -
"Our position, already officially ex
pressed, Is that any modification of
the armed merchantman phase of in
ternational law can only be achieved
by agreement of all parties concern
ed, and that it Is as much a usurpa
tion of authority for the central
powers to make the declaration that
they did a it would be for the United
States to change the International
lav on the subject." -,

LAUD Q TURK SOIL
(By United Press Leased Wire.)
London, Feb.' ' 1 9.--Under protec

landing 70 miles east of Treblzond,
a Turkish Black sea port. Only feeble
resisianue uae greeioa mem.
Petrograa advices Indicate that
these forces will move westward to
join the troop released for other ser
vice by the tall of Ezrerum, and now
heading for Treblzond. Inasmuch as
Treblzond is poorly fortified, the Joint
expedition probably will encounter
no serious resistance. "".'..Tfvr"
The landing parties were transport
ed from Batum, where tbey have
been held in readiness for several
months. The fact that tbey were not
nsed before leads to the belief that
Grand Duke Nicholas commands
more men than had been supposed
and that he now plans an aggressive
Armenian campaign, a move toward
Constantinople, or a Junction with
the British in Mesopotamia.
It the latter plan Is the ocurrence
In mind, it is believed the Russians
will go to DIarbekr, 140 mile outh
west of Ezrerum.
. It Is believed that not more than
30,000 Turks were captured at Ezre
rum, though this total will be swelled
If the retreat from that city (becomes
more confused.
The defenders abandoned heavy
artillery . after unsuccessfully at
tempting to destroy some of It.
Last night's Petrograd official
statement said "the forts in the for
tress ItRclf and in the surrounding
country are full of Turkish dead,"
and claimed that already 200 guns
had been counted,' not to mention
largo quantities of other booty. :

By William Philip Simms.
New York, Feb. 19. Has the long
anticipated big offensive begun along
the western front? ' '
" Are the recent dally smashes In
Artois and Champagne the prelude
to an early attempt to pierce the
lines and the start of a drive toward
Pari. Calais, or Cologne?'
If not, what Is the meaning of the
fighting in France?' :,: " V ' ;
Despite continuous pounding of
artillery all along the line and the
spirited clashes of Infantry for the
possession of. certain section of the
trenches, the Indications are that the
big offensive from either aide Is still
some distance off.' Apparently both
Germany and the allies are Jockey
ing for position, playing for the In
side track.-
There is no doubt that Germany Is
expecting the allies to launch a terri
fic punch against her in the spring.
Thla blow, she reasons, after looking
at the map, Is likely to fall in Cham
pagne and in Artois, north of Arras.
or In that vicinity.
The battle line Is shaped something
like the letter "1M If the German
line can be broken over an extended
front along the bottom of the L (in
the Champagne and along the top of
the L (around Arras) the forces hold
ing the corner will have to retire.
even though nnattacked, lest they
be cut off by a Junction of the two
drives beginning In Champagne and
Artois.
This Is probably the explanation of
the frenzied attacks hurled by the
Germans against the allies In these
two regions. They wish to prevent
thel French from getting a good toe
hold, from which to, make the spring.
The Germans are undoubtedly try
ing to harass the1 allies so much that
preparatory work such as trench dig
ging can be hindered.
On the other band, the French are
undoubtedly prepared for a big Ger
man offensive." It id believed Inevit
able. It is said in Paris that German
public opinkm' at home will demand
action In the western theater of war,
and French plans have, beyond any
doubt, 'been made tor an attack.
Surprise In' Parts would not b
great were the Germans to try seek
ing a new route to Parts. " At any
event. It seems little likely that any
real serious offensive movement will
be undertaken by either side until
tho weatherman turns on enough'
good weather to make the handling
of artillery easy. Indeed, the' slumps
ing of the past two or three days In
the western operations after a 'brief
outburst of activity haa been due to
stormy weather.
Rainy weather, with the accom
panying saturated ground, bogs and
loblollies, Hi hot especially helpful for 1
an advance, Inasmuch as big guns are
the backbone of the war and can
scarcely be moved to advantage over
such positions'. ' '
The present fighting In France
therefore seems to be only the sharp
preliminary clashes of armies strug
gling for the advantage In a double
offensive movement.
