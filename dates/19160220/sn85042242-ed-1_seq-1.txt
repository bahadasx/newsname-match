Officials of National City Bank
of New York Will Be Asked
to Testify.
Washington, Feb. 19.—Senatorial
investigation charges that Amer­
ican financiers have attempted to
monopolize the sisal crop of Yucatan,
Mexico, was broadened today to in­
clude an inquiry into whether the In­
ternational Harvester company sought
by intimidating American ,^aij^ers to
prevent sisal planter^ pb taming: mon­
ey to market their'crop.
Stark County Officials Will Be
Tried on a Charge of Em*
bezzlement.
The supreme court has affirmed the
district court decision in the Stark
county case which has been hanging
•fire for some yean. The case is the
outgrowth of the embezzlement of
funds in the office of the auditor five
years ago. Some of the bonding com­
panies disclaimed partial liability in
the matter and a former states attor­
ney took the suits on a contingent
basis, thereby realizing -fc considera­
ble sum for both himsfelf and the
county. A former board of commis­
sioners and states attorney had con­
sidered the amounts uncollectable.
Citizens contended that the full
amount realized from the bonding
companies should be turned into the
county treasury and employed coun­
sel to prosecute. Defendants entered
a demurrer, which was denied by the
lower court, the point being that the
suit should he tried, and now the
higher court says that it should be
tried in the usual way. Hence it is
presumed that the cases will be up
for trial at the regular term of dis­
trict court in May.

Senator Robinson Presents Fur­

His Charges.
Washington, Feb. 19.—More evi­
dence in support, of his charge that
the army. MiMton1 service is "con­
temptibly inefficient" was made pub­
lic tonight by Senator Robinson, who
declared he would continue his efforts
for a congressional investigation, des­
pite the announcement that the war
department would make an inquiry in­
to tbe subject. Chairman Chamberlain
of the senate military committee, be­
fore which Mr. Robinson testified yes­

tee to vote Monday on the senator's
resolution for investigation.
"I introduced my resolution in De­
cember," said Senator Robinson. "I
waited until yesterday for. the war de­
partment to act. For months, the de­
partment had all this information.
As a result of Inefficiency, several
men, who believed tbe machines were
unsafe, were compelled to fly and
were killed. Now, I think tbe inquiry
should be made by persons outside

A
New Rpckford Citizen
Is Opposed to Removal
Cincinnati, O., Feb. 19.—"Public
opinion gains forth an effectiveness
when expressed to organization," said
Myron T. Herrick, former amDassa
dor to France, before the Commercial
club here tonight. Public opinion
may be translated into action through
the commercial clubs, chambers of
commerce, boards of trade, or similar
organizations of whatever name.
"A few days ago,- President Wilson
sought the chamber of commerce in
several cities as the means of awak­
ening the public mind on prepared­
ness," continued Mr. Herrick. "What
public mail would have sought this
medium ten years ago for creating
public opinion?
"Business and government ought to
work in absolute harmony and under­
standing, and in this world of evil, it
is essential that they do. With us in
the United States, business has been
the stronger organization ever since
the Civil war."

STEAMER AGMOUNDI*
Halifax, N. S., Feb. 19.—WhS res
ported late today that an unidentified
tank steamer of about. 4,000 tons had
gone aground at Herring Cove, ort the
west side of the entrance to th# outer
harbor. Owing to the storm, tlu iden­
tity of the vessel could not be learned.
EDITOR'8 NOTE.
Rev. J. M. Mahin of New (Rockford volunteered to write this article
for the readers of the Tribune. It is a well known fact that many
in Eddy county are not in sympathy with this campaign of land spec­
ulators. Rev. Mahin speaks for them.
By Rev. J. M. Mahin.
Nearly thirty-three' years ago, I took up ray residence in the
then territory-of Dakota. The first vote I east in Dakota Territory
was in the election of delegates to attend a convention at Yankton.
It was generally understood that the principal, errand of our dele­
gates was to make arrangements to establish the capital at Bis­
marck, which they did.
NOT A RAINBOW CHASER.
But now a furor-is raised to remove the capital to the town
of New Rockford, and New Rockford is all agog over the expected
coup. am a resident of New Rockford: therefore, why should I
not be a ''rainbow chaser" with the rest? Well, because that,
having analyzed the alleged reasons for removal, I find they all
dissolve into very thin ail*. It is said by the friends of the removal
scheme, "New Rockford is more centrally located." As a matter
of fact, the two towns are so nearly the same distance from the
geographical center of the state that this point is absolutely nil
as a factor in the case. The claim is also made that New Rockford
has the best railroad facilities. Hut just, take a recent map of the
state and study it a little and all that, falls to the ground. And
the railroads, if they come, that are believed to be headed for Now
Rockford, will still make Bismarck more accessable.
THAT LAWLESS ELEMENT.
Then, too, they say, "Remove the capital from Bismarck be­
cause it is such a lawless town!" Well, let us hasten to confess
that Bismarck has its share of the laAVless element, but let us not
forget Hint a large part of this lawless 'eleriie)i't,! arp .there .tieeaiise
the capital is there, and that were the ''eqfuljal', re^jkovefl to some
other town, that same lawless element would surely follow it, or
beat it there. ,r::^,yu
Also, let us not forget that New Rbekfb^l could well nigh give
Bismarck pointers on the subject, of lawlessness.
"AIN'T GOIN' TO COST NOTHIN'
Also, Air, Farmer, r»wmd«t,
arid emanating from the Capital Removal Club" of New Rock­
ford, that the removal of the capital from Bismarck to New Rock­
ford "ain't going to cost nobody nothin.'
But every thoughtful farmer in the state should know that
if the removal is made, every farmer and every other -poor folks in
the state will be digging up coin for the hext twenty-five years
to pay for it.
PURELY SELFISH.
This whole capital removal campaign resounds with the rumble
of commissary carts on the "Plains of Armageddon." It is in its
last analysis purely selfish. It is an exploitation of the baser
forces. Not once, in all the scores of articles I have scanned, have
I seen so much as a microscopic hint that this question might be
submitted to the arbitrament of the forty principles of right. I
have one word more to say: I am, in common with tens of thous­
ands of the people a professed believer in Jesus Christ, the Savior
of the World. He impressed upon his followers the highest law
that ever found a place in the annals of this world—"Whatsoever
ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." Can
any Christian support this removal plan without repudiating "Him
who spake as never man spake." I can not. To do so would be
to do to others what we would not wish they should do to us.
Finally, Bismarck was made the capital city by those who
came to the then inhospitable prairies of the northwest in a very
early day. That was a time that "tried men's souls" and women's
too. Is not something due to the memory of those who "bore the
burden and heat of the day, "as we know little of now?" Are we
to smother the finer sentiments of the soul in the 'baser greed for
gain? I hope not.

MAY INCREASE RATE
OF IHEJNCOiE TAX
Proposal to Lower Exemption Fi­

Raise $100,000,000.
Washington Feb. 19.—The proposal
to amend the income tax law so as to
include smaller incomes is virtually
certain to be abandoned in favor of
an increased rate on those already
taxed, it was declared tonight by
Democratic house leaders.
Sentiment against lowering the ex­
emption limit, in order to provide ad­
ditional revenue for preparedness
Crystalized, it was said, in the Demo­
cratic caucus Wednesday night, when
Democratic Leader Kitchin declared
against changing the minimum of
$3,000. Since then protests against
all reduction plans have become more
outspoken daily.
Leaders declared tonight that virtu­
ally the entire preparedness revenue
burden would be met with income
taxes. Tentative bills, looking to rais­
ing $100,000,000 solely by an increased
income tax rate, are being discussed
and will be offered soon in commit­
tee.

British Owners of Boat Will Be*
gin Libel Action to Recover
German Prize.
PRIZE COURT RULING
WILL DECIDE QUESTION
Deoision of Tribunal Will Give
Department Precedent for
Future Cases.
Washington, Feb. 19.—A libel suit
instituted today by British owners of
the liner, Appam, to recover the ship
from the German prize crew that
brought it into Hapton Roads is ex­
pected by state department officials
to result in a prize court ruling that
will clear away many perplexing fea­
tures which have confronted them in
dealing with the case.
Establish Precedent.
With Germany asking that, as a
prize, the Appam be allowed to re­
main indefinitely in American waters
under the Prussian traty of 1'828, and
Great Britain insisting that the liner
must be restored to ln»r owners under
the lHague convention of 907, depart­
ment officials would welcome a judg­
ment by a competertt tribunal, not on­
ly for guidance in tlicl present case,
but as a precedent, for'The future.
The department, in the absence of
such a precedent, has belrl tentatively
that the Appam is a German prize,
but never has passed formally on Ger­
many's request that ihe vessel be al­
lowed to remain indefinitely in Amer­
ican waters. A reply to that request
now is in course of preparation. It
was said today, however, that lite re­
sponse might wait until the prize
court had acted.
Business Program of Wide Scope
and Tremendous Possibili­

Minot, Feb.
1 1
J!).—Presenting
ton
Mil
a busi­
ness program of wide scope, the suc­
cessful promotion of which will re­
tain to the farmers of North Dakota
vast profits that now go outside the
state, the North Dakota union of the
American Society of Equity last eve­
ning concluded its annual meeting in
this city.
The business policy, presented to
the farmers of the state by the Equity,
is one by which the organization anti­
cipates the elimination of middlemen,
both from the handling of their prod­
ucts to the consumers as well as the
elimination of the middleman in hand­
ling the products of other industries
to them.
Outlining specifically certain feat­
ures of their movement for the estab­
lishment of the state co-operative
packing plant, taking first steps to­
ward the creation of a central govern­
ing board that will be in a position to
place the co-operative elevators on a
more stable basis and endorsing the
policy of a central buying organiza­
tion similar to that maintained by the
Society of Equity in Montana, so ably
explained to North Dakotans by Presi­
dent Lowrie, of the western organiza­
tion, the North Dakota union has just
concluded probably the most import­
ant gathering of its history.
"We believe the society stands in
better position today than ever be­
fore," said Pres. M. P. Johnson, at the
conclusion of the session. "We have
gotten down to concrete problems, the
value of which must be apparent to
every farmer, as well as to the busi­
ness men of the state, and with the
success of these movements, will
come a greater measure of prosperity
and contentment to every citizen of
the state."

Army Scheme.
Washington, Feb. 1*9.—A scheme
for expanding the civilian camp move­
ment into a definite organization of
federal volunteers will be proposed to
the house military committee by Rep­
resentative Kahn of California, rank­
ing republican member.
Under the plan, the organization
would be, in a measure, a substitute
for the administration's continental
army scheme.
Details have not been worked out
but .'Representative Kahn said he had
been in correspondence with those
urging direct aid by congress for the
summer camp movement, who had
told him 100,000 men could be enroll­
ed if such aid were granted. Mr.

could be formed, who would obligate
themselves for service in time of war
in return for the extensive instruc­
tion they receive at the camps.

New York, Feb. 19.—One man is
dead, and anothef is missing, as the
result of a compressed air blowout
late today in a subway under con»
struction 100 feet below the surface
of the East river.
A third man, who was shot with the
others through mud and water to the
surface of the river, was bruised and
dazed, but soon recovered after re­
moval to a hospital.
The blowout is believed to have
been caused by a leak in the com­
pressed air pumped into the subway
to stabalize the work under construc­
tion.
The man killed was Frank Driver,
and the missing man is John Mc
Oarty, both described as "miners."
They were with Marshal Mabey, a
helper, when they were sent sky rock­

MESOPOTAMIAN FORCES
MEET SEVERE DEFEAT
Russians Still Pursuing Defeated
Turkish Army West of
Erzerum.
London, Feb. 19.—Asia, and Africa
figure more prominently than Europe
in the current war news. The Rus-.
sians are following up with vigor their
recent success in Turkish Anpenla.
Constantinople reports a reverse for
the British in,. /Mesopotamia, while
London anpQuncea ,the, lompletiQn of
the conquest of the iKamerun, the Im­
portant German colony in west equa*
torial Africa. The immense forces
massed in the European war area
are just now comparatively inactive.
The pursuit of the Turks who fled
from Erzerum with the fall of the
fortress is being continued by the
Russians. The possibility of a stand
by the Ottoman forces a short dis­
tance west of the city is being consid­
ered by Petrograd, but no reports of
such resistance by the defeated army:
have been received.
Kamerun Campaign.
The completion of the Kamerun
conquest by the Franco-British forces
was effected with the capture of.Mo­
ra, a position in the northernmost
section of the colony, the last held
by the Germans, their southern forces
having recently retreated over the
border into Spanish Guiana, where
they Avere interned. The entire pro­
tectorate of 191,130 square miles and
a population of 2,460,000, including
about 2,000 whites, has thus been
wrested from iGerman pontrol, after
eampaVgn tttat lasted -nearfy a',year
having been begun"In the spring of
191 r.
No very recent British reports of
the Mesopotamian operations is at
hand, but Constantinople announces
that when a (British force' drifted
down the Tigris from Kut-El-Amafa.
where Gen. Townsend's army is bot­
tled up, tried to cross to the west
bank of the river, it was defeated in
a. three-hour battle and fell iback to
its second line" positions, leaving a
number of dead!
Take Turkish Division.
The Russians have captured the re­
mainder of the 34th Turkish division
northwest of Erzerum, says an offi­
cial statement issued today. One
Russian corps on the assault of iEe«
zerum captured 230 cannon.
Deny Joint Action.
A Copenhagen dispatch to the "E®»
change Telegraph company says that
a Swedish official statement denies
that Sweden has requested the Unit­
ed States to join in a conference of
neutral countries.
Dispatches from Washington on
February 17 said that Sweden had
appealed to the United States-to co­
operate with her and other neutral
nations to maintain the preservation
of rules of international law concern­
ing the protection of neutral com­
merce and navigation.
Russia's Finances.
Contrasting Russia's increasing
prosperity with Germany's financial
and economic conditions, the Russian
minister of finance, Pierre L. Bark, in
a statement to the Associated Press
today expressed the opinion that Rus­
sia could prosecute the war indefi­
nitely without serious menace to tbe
financial stability of the country.
"Russia's finances rest on the most
solid foundation of the world," said
the minister.
"It rests on the incontrovertible
fact of the Russian people's increased
earnings and savings. When a year
ago the savings banks showed a
monthly increase in deposits of $50,
000,000 rubles, it was regarded as phe­
nomenal, but that was only the begin*
ning."
Mobilize Physicians.
The approaching mobilisation of
physicians and surgeons is forecast in
a circulatr issued by the local gov­
ernment boards to the local authori­
ties. It points out the necessity for
making provisional arrangements tat
enable every medical man, below tlie
age of 45, who can be spared without
injury to the civilian population, to
place himself at the disposal, of the
authorities and take a commission in
the army or navy, if required.
Italian Air Raid.
An air raid by a squadron of It
machines against Laibach, capital of
Carnicla, Austria^Hungary, is official­
ly reported here. Bombs were drop*
ped on tbe town and they uteris
thought to have done considerable
damage. Austrian aeroplanes ascend*
ed for the purpose of driving oft the
raiders, and six of them surrounded
one Italian machine and brought it to
earth.
Allies Occupy Island.
The Greek minister of the Interior
announces that a detachment of al*
lied forces has occupied Ortkhaal, a
small island near Corfu.' The
for the occupation is unknown.
