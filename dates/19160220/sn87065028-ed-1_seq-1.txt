The body of Mr. P. S. Hairston,
who lost his life in the fire which de
stroyed the club house of American
Club tit Toronto, Canada, last Wed
nesday, was brought here for burial,
having arrived over the Mobile and
Ohio railroad at noon yesterday and
which was carried immediately to
Friendship cemetery, where inter
ment took place.
Rev. R. B. Kggleston, pastor of
the First Presbyterian church, con
ducted the funeral service, which
was solemn and impressive, and an
appropriate musical program, in
cluding a vocal solo by Miss Mary
Lou Peyton, was rendered.
Mr. Hairston was about 52 years
old, and for the past eight years
had been residing in Toronto, where
he was engaged in the mining busi
ness. He was born near Crawford,
and was a member of a family which
for many years has been prominent
in local financial and social circles.
Surviving him are his widow who was
in Toronto at the time of his death
and who accompanied the remains
to Columbus, three sisters, Mrs. E. 1
E. Moore, of this city, Mrs. W. S.
Turner, of Crawford, and Mrs. J. E.
Cox, who lives in the prairie section

said to have been massacred by the

There has been considerable ar-
tllery activity around the positions
taken by the Germans recently
from the British in the vicinity of
Ypres and several attempts by the
British to recapture their lost terri
tory by infantry attacks have been
repulsed, according to Berlin, with
heavy casualties. With the exception
of a French assault against Ger
mans south of the Somme, which
Berlin also declares was put down,
the artillery of both sides has been
the sole instrument of warfare along
the French front.
Austria reports less activity on th
part of the Italians on the Austro
Italian front.
Late dispatches from Berlin are to
the effect that Kavaya, Albania,

J. H. Fisher, named by the governor
to suiceed Bauh, maintained separ
ate offices here tonight, each claim-
ng authority to art as the chief ad
ministrative officer of the county.
Haugh, armed with a chancery
court injunction, which forbids in
terference with him in the discharge
of his duties as sheriff, established
headqjnrters in an office building,
while F'"hfr and a detachment of
state troops were in control of the
court house.
Fisler was Installed in office
early today by Adjutant General
Scales and a company of the state
militia after Baugh had refused to
retire pending a supreme court de
cision defining his status and the eli
g b-lity of Fisher. Governor Uiibo
had declared the office vacant be
cause of an alleged shortage in
Raugh's settlement with the state
for a previous term.
No attempt was made today to
interfere with either of the two
men, but capiases were issued by the
chancellor, who granted Baugh the
injunction, ordering members of the
military company which installed
Fisher to explain their action.
A special .jneetinic of the county
board of supervisors also was called
to be held next Tuesday to consider
the controversy.
Neither side would say tonifht
what other action was contemplated.

A recent special regarding legis

Dr. R S. Curry, a former Columbian

cial, which gives other interesting
news of the capital follows:
Jackson, Miss., Feb. 17. In the
I Senats today after more than three
hours debate end discussion, a :ate
game and fish commission, similar
to the Spears bill, which was sub
marined in the House a fortnight
ago, got by and without amendment
of material nature.
This was the bill of Senator Rich
ardson, which he introduced subse
quent to the defeat of the House
bill, and had been made the special
order for the day. Should the Senate
measure pass the House, of which
there is no assurance, it will give
Mississippi a game law as strong and
us enforceable as exists in any state
as declared by the men who profess
to know.
The Senate also passed the House
pension appropriation bill, after ad
ding $25,000 a year to the amount
allowed by the House, bringing the
amount up to $500,000, or a million
dollars for the biennial period. The
House passed the bill carrying an
j appropriation of $475,000 a year, an
agua a larger sum than the United
States for an option on the Nicara
gua canal route was urged in the
Senate as an argument for early
ratification of the pending treaty.

I
As the House is in no mood to
agree to a.iy increase over its own
allowance, a deadlock between the
two bodies is anticipated over this
important measure.
It was Sunfljwer day with the
House of Representatives, who spent
the forenoon, or the greater part of
it, considering the Senate bill to
split Sunflower" county into two ju-
Jackson, Miss., Feb. 18. Members
of the Senate anil House from all
part of the state are hearing (mm
their constituents in regard to the
Hemphill bill, which wa introduced
yesterday in the Senate, the purpose
of which is to bring about an abate
ment of the numerous suits and
claims now pending throughout the
state, filed by the state revenue
agent, alleging taxes due on cotton
held for market or for other purposes
.ifter February 1, for a period of six
years. The Hemphill bill provides a
way for the termination of these
suits, and while there are doubts en
tertained as to the rights of the Leg
islature to invade the jurisdictions
of the courts, or of matters pending
therein, there is an undoubted senti
ment among a majority of the law
makers against the imposition of
taxes on agricultural products.
The tenor of these messages to
members of the Legislature is that,
regardless of the legal and constitu
tional questions involved, the bill
should pass. The aggregate of claims
now pending is estimated at several
millions of dollars, and if enforced
by the courts would spell ruination
to numbers of men and firms within
the state, it is claimed.
The House committee on judiciary
today reported favorably, by a good
majority, the Senate bill to provide
for a recodfication of the laws'," con
stitutional and statute, of the state
of Mississippi, that may be in force
and effect up to Dec. 31, 1918. While
the favorable recommendation by
the committee may not guarantee
the passage of the bill through the
House, its chances there are consid
ered favorable.
The fact that the bill provides for
salaries at $3,000 each to euch of the
three commissioners, may have a de
terrent effect on the low pressure
contingent, and the backers of the
measure are not over-confidant on
that account.
Another highway bill was under
consideration, but owing to its length
and highly technical phraseology
and the conflict of important matters
of present moment and interest, this
was not completed today. If passed,
Mississippi will have a state highway
aw as sound and workable as any
state in the country.
The fight between the "low pres
sure brigade" in the House and the
"high pressure contingent" in ' the
Senate became acute today when the
Senate by a vote of 23 to 12, refus
ed to recede from its position in
creasing the common scnooi appro
priation $73,000 more than the
amount fixed by the House. The
Senate rejected a joint committee re
port recommending the adoption of
the amount fixed by the House, and
the two bodies are deadlocked on
the question.
The House adopted the Senate res
olution providing for an investiga
tion of the state land office, and a! o
the Everett resolution to meet on
lh afternoons of Monday, Wednes
day and Friday. The motion to table
the motion to reconsider the anti
lobbying bill was carried. The mo
lion to reconsider the Spears' do li
crse bill also was tabled.
The house passed the "full crew"
bill, after accepting a committee
amendment striking out reference
to electric trains, and placing the
number of cars to be operated with
out an extra flagman at 50 instead
of forty, with two additional flagmen
for a train of a hundred cars or
more.
The bill seeking to reduce prem
ium taxes on insurance companies,
but rasing the license, was passed.
Insurance Commissioner T. M. Henry
was invited to discuss the bill, ani
wid it would give a definite source
of revenue from insurance compan
ies and meant an increase of about
$25,000 annually. The bill apples to
only life insurance companies.
