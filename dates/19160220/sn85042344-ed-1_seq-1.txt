Harris' Friends Fight on Old Issues,

I'nable to stir up any discord among the Republicans of Tulsa county
and the First congressional district, Jim Harris has added Colonel Tom
Latta to his list of field marshals and he Is hero now assisting Captain
C. U. Rogers in the laudable undertaking of carrying out the usual dis

in the selection of his field marshals by obtaining the services of men who
In the past have been his most bitter opponents. There Is something
wrong. Kit her these men have been wrong in the past or else .Mr. Harris
has undergone a very remarkuble change during the pust few weeks. We
are inclined to believe that Mr. Hurris has not undergone any chan.te

valuable und more satisfactory reasons or excuses to themselves for doing
so. It can be left to them to make whatever explanations they may see fit

made public tonight by Senator

he would continue his et forts for a

"I introduced my resolution in He

The data made public .tonight was
given out In the foi in of a statement
bv Senator Robinson (Minting from -i'l-
ditionul letters he said had buun
written by aviation oflieers.
"In one letter," said the statement,
"Colonel Reber wrote: 'The house
military committee, which is Mr. Hay,
for reasons best known to himself,
made up hi'j mind to stick to three
hundred thousand, and he succeeded
in bluffing the senate conferees. This
is the who'.! story und had we icoiiu
to some itiier committee we would
probably have gotten us much money
as the navy did.'

"A letter from Captain Cowan to
Colonel Reber, dated January 15,
1915, asked for authority to spend
$H0i for the purchase of a 1H15
motorcycle. '.My offieiul reason,'
wrote Cupt.un Cowan, 'for wanting to
purchase this motorcycle Is that tlio
latest mod rn motorcycle we have
here is 191 :l. We should keep track
of the Improvements und be ready (
recer.iniend the type best suiwT for

wanting to purchase this motorcycle
Is to provide myself with means of
transportation between North Island
and my Uarers at Coronado.'
"I'pon the quartermaster's corps In
the army is placed the duty of build
ing barracks and thev have appro
priations for that purpose. Never
theless, Colonel Reber on May 29,
1 9 IS, wrote us follows to Captain
Cowan: 'There Is one thing I wish
you would ne very careful about and
not let your quartermaster refer in
any way lo the structure we have
erected on North Island as a tempor
ary barracks. A requisition arrived
the other day for something for the
temporary barracks and the quarter
master's office fell down in a fit. They
said that thev hud no temporary bar
racks und that they knew nothing
about temporary barracks, which was
their proper state of mind, as wo

"The Washington officials kiiow
what Is behind this persecution," he
