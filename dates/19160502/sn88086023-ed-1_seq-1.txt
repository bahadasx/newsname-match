I
PETITION MAY BE SENT COUNCIL
TO DISCONTINUE pfJBLfo

(Eaat Oregonlan Special.)
MILTON-FRBEWATER, Ore, May
2. Considerable feeling hag been
stirred up In Milton and Freewater
over several of the school teachers of
District No. SI attending danceg given
by Burton's orchestra Wednesday and
Saturday nights of each week. It ig
understood that a petition wag to be
circulated and presented to the city
council asking for discontinuance of
the public dances, but tho council hog
not been directly appealed to yet, and
has not been able o take action of
any kind. Rev. Arthur Thomas of the
Methodist church haa taken up the
fight of the anti-dance people, and
particularly when attended by public
school teachers There la much bitter
comment among thoae who have batn
attending the dances and many who
have not at tho opposition They
claim the dances have been attended
by people ranked among the best
thought of In the two towns, and that
there hag not been a glngle time since
the new management took hold of the (
dances, that they have not been strict
ly respectable In every way. The fight
promises to develop Into as acute a
stage as the Sunday baseball Issue a
few years ago, when It wag forced to
a vote at a special election, and the
opponents of Sunday ball lost their
contention by a heavy majority.

DOUGLAS, May 3. An em

wag effective here today. Ship

EL PASO, May 2. After receiving
final Instructions from Washington,
Scott stated that a second meeting
with Obregon was scheduled for this
afternoon on the American side of
the International bridge, In the im
tnlgnttion station.
The instructions confirm the state
ments that the conference would not
have the power 'to decide the future
movements of the American troops in
Mexico and thut there would not be
an immediate withdrawal of the ex
pedition. Scott will advise Obregon
that Washington has refused to con.
sent to a discussion of withdrawal,
nbregon is expected to politely de
cline in discing ii. Mln nit else until
th Nrdrawni question ig settled.
Thenwe conference mr.stSgjfypurn
deadlocked.
obregon said he would report the
whole situation to Carranxa. It was
Indicated that the failure of the con
ference would result in further di
plomatic exchanges and not in mili
tary operations. A break is not con
sidered likely. Intervention Interests
are still busy along the border trying
to induce into the situation something
to make intervention inevitable.
The Mexicans and the American
armies are Inactive. At some places
they ure only a few miles apart
There are now 17,000 Americans in
Mexico. Funston was confident that
the Americans could hold out indefi.
nitely ugainst the large force of
Mexicans, taking the offensive if de
sirable. RAKER AND LANSING ARE
HOPEFUL OF AGREEMENT
WASHINGTON. May 2. Secretary
of War Baker and Secretary of State
Lansing believe that Scott and Obre
gon can reach an agreement for a
better cooperation between the Am
ericans and the Mexicans In hunting
down Villa. Thought the Carranzis
tas strongly desire the withdraw! of
the Americans it was thought they
may see the logic of assisting the ex
pedition when they realize that the
hunt must continue.
Baker s new instructions to Scott
are regarded as assuring further con.
ferences. Baker was informed that
intervention advocates at El Paso are
endeavoring to befog the ntmosphere
and influence oponlons and actions
of the military authorities. Whether
the information wag official was not
revealed. Baker stated that he had
the utmost confidence In Scott's abil
ity to handle the situation.
PERSHING CONCENTRATES
FORCES FOR ANY CRISIS
COLUMBUS. May 2. Pershing was
concentrating his forces today as
though an attack was momentarily
Imminent. With the conference at Kl
Paso hanging fire, the situation was
tense. Every movement In the con
ference room was immediately wire
lessed to Pershing.
The scattered American column!
have been drawn Into the advanced
base and additional defensive works
have been constructed at geveral
points. Troops at Columbus are held
in readiness for a move nt short no
tice. Four companies of Infantry ore
preparing to march soon. It was be
lieved they had received orders to re.
inforce the advanced detachments.
A new high power aeroplane was
tested today. It probably will be sent
to the front immediately.

Mayor Best Files
Demurrer in The
Case Against Him
ARGUMENT WILL BE HEARD
THIS AFTERNOON BEFORE
JUSTICE OF PEACE.
Mayor James A. Best, through his
attorneys. Fee & Fee, this morning
filed a demurrer to the complaint
made against him recently. Argu
ment on the demurrer will be given
this afternoon before Justice of the
Peace Joe H. Parke, and, in the
event that the demurrer is overruled.
It is probable that the mayor will be
given a hearing tomorrow some time.
The complaint, made out by the
district attorney and sworn to by Ar
thur J. Gibgon, chargea the mayor
with violating the state vagrancy law
and specifically charges htm with
"violent, riotous and disorderly con
duct" by using "abusive and obscene
language" in the presence of a large
assembly of people at the Oregon
theater on the night or March 2.
The demurrer bt marie iinnn four
! grounds, as follows? First that th
complaint does not state efacts suffi
cient to constitute a crime; second,
that it doeg not substantially con
form to the requirements of Chapter
7, Title 18, Lord's Oregon Laws;
third, that more than one crime Ij
charged; and fourth, that the com
plain contains matter which. If
true, would constitute legal Justifica
tion and excuse for the crime charged
therein.
