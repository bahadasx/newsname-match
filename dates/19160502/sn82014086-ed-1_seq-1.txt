Dublin, May 1. via London. A re
turn to normal conditions is being ac
complished gradually in Dublin, and it
is now possible to give the first com
plete account of the happenings of
the last week. Hitherto news of the
Dublin uprising has reached the out
side world in fragmentary form, ow
ing to the Interruption of telegraphic
communication, the censorship and
. the frequent conflict of statements,
but the collapse of the rebellion has
removed these conditions in great part
end the story of the uprising, from
the time it began last Monday, may
now be given in .proper sequence, in
the light of information obtained from
authoritative sources.
When the irreconciliable opponents
of -British rule In Ireland proclaimed
' the republic their movement was look
ed upon as a mere dtsplay of fanatic-
ism. It was soon found, however, that
It was no mere demonstration, but an
outbreak which had behind it a fair
organization and sufficient force to
strangle the life of the capital and
i compel the authorities to send for
military assistance from England. At
: no time, however, did the military
or civil authorities consider the re
v bellion a menace to the government,
1 nor did they have any fears as to their
ability to cope with It quickly as soon
an its extent became apparent.
What occurred was as follows:
'l First Dash of Sinn Feiners.'
S Monday The first move was a dash
by members of the Sinn Fein, into
i the general post office. Many of these
' men were in uniform of the Irish vol
i unteerg. a body formed at the time
granting home rule to Ireland, the
onleet being to resist any attempt by
Ulster to oppose the home rule law.
The party worked quietly, compell
ing all officials to quit their post3
while they cut telegraphic communi
cations with the rest of Ireland and
with England.
Postsd Sentinels, Fully Armed
The rebels posted sentinels, fully
armed, at the doors and windows, and
prevented any soldiers or policemen
from entering the building.
Several Soldiers Killed in First Few
Minutes.
Boon afterwards firing opened in
. the neighboring streets, for the reb
els Immediately shot down any man
in khaki. Several officers and men of
the regular army thus fell victims in
the first few minutes or the revolt.
Rebels Seize City Hall.
The authorities, unprepared at first
to deal with the uprising, ordered the
police and soldiers to retire at once
to their quarters, none of them being
armed. In the meantime the rebels,
according to their pre-arranged plan,
seized other points in the city. They
established themselves at the city hall.
Liberty Hall and St. Stephen's Green
and also occupied many houses in
Sackville Street and the side streets
leading to It. Their sentries patrolled
blocks In the center of the city and
sharpshooters took up positions on
the roofs and at the windows of
houses." An attempt was made to
seize Dublin Castle: but the little
guard of Royal Irish Constabulary and
soldiers prevented the rebels from
getting beyond the gate, at which they
killed the policeman on duty.
Authorities Were Powerless.
i The authorities were powerless, with
the forces at their disposal, to dis
lodge or attempt to combat the reb
els who, however, made a great mis
take, which eventually cost them dear.
They either forgot to seize the tele
phone exchange or did not think it
worth their attention. Thus the au
thorities were able to send a call to
the military officers at Camp Cur
ragh, some thirty miles away. From
this point a considerable body of
troops was Immediately despatched to
i the capital.
8niping Fairly Prevalent.
Tuesday The, situation In the
v morning was virtually unchanged, ex
, cept that the rebels apparently had
Increased In numbers and spread in
, small parties about the city. Sniping
i was fairly prevalent In all quarters
. of Dublin throughout the day and
j numbers of casualties occurred among
j soldiers, rebels and civilians, the last
suffering more than the two fighting
bodies because they failed to grasp
' the seriousness of the situation.
No effort was undertaken on this
'ty - to turn the rebels out of their
strongholds, aa the force of military
on hand was still insufficient for the
purpose. The military in London had
been communicated with and within
a short time a, large body of troops
was on the way to cope with the re
bellion. On Tuesday evening resi
dents of the city were still strolling
along the walks of the Sackville
Street center.
Fighting and Bloodshed.
Wednesday On the morning of this
day the authoriites formed a plan to
deal with the situation and began
making dispositions of troops, draw
t Ing a Targe cordon of men around the
I city and other smaller cordons around
the three principal areas occupied by
the rebels at Sackville 6 tree t, St.
Stephen's Green and four courts.
'These movements of troops led to
t much fighting and bloodshed. Snip
ing became general - throughout the
city. The rebels were supplied with
, ample ammunition and used It so
' freely that It was dangerous to walk
even a few steps In the open or to sit
at a window. ,
By Wednesday evening the two par
ties of combatants and the areas they
occurred were more or less accurate
ly defined. The Sinn Feiners would
tot allw anyone to pass without the
written authority of their leaders and
the military, on their side, proclaim
ed martial law and restricted the
movements of civilians to the streets
in which they resided, while all were
forbidden to go out of their homes af
ter dark or even before dawn.
Soldiers Remained Under Shelter.
Soldiers on duty at the ends of
streets were compelled to remain un
der shelter from rebel bullets which
came from every quarter and angle.
During the course of the day a gun
boat came up the River Liffey, fired
several shells into the Liberty Hall
which was occupied by a number of
rebel officers and soon demolished it.
The cordons of troops gradually drew
tighter around the rebel forts and the
firing became faster and more furi
ous. Veritable Hail of Bullets.
Thursday By this time the city
was under a veritable hail of bullets,
and the small-shot fusillade became a
continuous roar. The Associated
Press correspondent with several oth
er newspaper men, passed along the
custom house quay by the north wall
and thence over the circular road, with
bullets striking the walls and the
ground all around. The rebels in
some force had taken a position in a
flour mill on the south side from which
they hurried the troops on the north
side until the authorities decided to
use artillery to dislodge them. A
dozen shells did the work and the reb
els retired to a disused distillery far
ther south, whence they were still
able to give much trouble.
Spectacular Bombardment
,,, 1V,, .
this point. From the ton of the dis
tillery tower floated a green rebel flag.
The bombardment was spectacular.
Only 48 shells were fired and everyone
hit the distillery, but the flagstaff was
pot shot away and it hung over the
aide of the building even after the
rebels had concluded the time was
ripe to evacuate the structure.
Meanwhile fighting was becoming
hotter in the Sackville street area.
Rebel Quarters Shelled.
Friday The sniping by rebel sharp
shooters had become so prevalent by
Friday that the artillery officer in
charge decided to shell the post office
and houses in its neighborhood. Eight
shells had been fired into the Young
Men's Christian Association building,
two into tne catholic club and two in
to the post office, when a cessation of
the cannonrde was ordered by a su
perior officer, as some houses had
caught fire and it was feared the en
tire city, might be placed in peril. Ad
ditional fresh troop had arrived and
the cordons were further tightened,
although this was accompanied bv
much fighting of a particularly dan
gerous type, every spot in the streets
being In the danger zone. The rebels
started fires in several places in the
hope, it was reported, of the flames
reaching the castle.
Offer of Surrender.
..Saturday Early on this mornlns
the announcement was made that the
leaders of the revolt had requested
that they be allowed to surrender un
conditionally, as their commander-in-chief,
J. H. Pearce. had been wound
ed in the leg and it was reported that
James Connolly, commander of the
rebel troops, had received a severe
wound. How many of the rebels
surrendered to the military with their
leaders was not learned on this day,
but their action brought about an im-,
mediate diminution' of sniping and the
city became comparatively quiet. Only
two. areas remained in possession of
the rebels at night.
Isolated Parties of Snipers.
Isolated parties of snipers still con
tinued to pot at the troops, being ev
idently unaware of the capture of
their leaders, but that evening it was
possible to walk In the streets with
out running an excessive risk from
stray bullets.
Considered It Work of Fanatics.
The Asoscfated Press representative
made two long tours through the city
In order to obtain an Idea of the sen
timents of the population regarding
the rebellion, which to all Intents and
purposes had by this time been sup
pressed. Some men, chiefly of the
transport workers class, were suWen,
evidently having expected greater re
sults from the movement which had
been in preparation for a long time.
Most of the population, however, ex
pressed Indignation at the outbreak.
which they considered the work of
fanatics and as never having had a
chance of permanent success.
Collapse of the Rebellion.
Sunday The final collapse of the
rebellion came on this day, the ex
pected happening and the main body
of the rebels In Dublin surrendering
during the course of the day, begin
ning in the morning when those who
had been established in the College of
Surgeons gave themselves up. one of
the prisoners nere oeing the Countess
Markievicx, said to be one of the lead
ing spirits of the revolt..
Proclamation Issued.
In a proclamation Issued by J. H,
Pearce, as "provisional president," the
surrender of all the rebels was ad
vised, as the members of the provi
sional government had agreed to un
conditional surrender "in order to
prevent further slaughter of unarmed
people ana in the nope or saving the
lives of our followers who are . sur
rounded and hopelessly outnumbered.'
Outside of Dublin, however, fighting
continued at some points, nut mes-
sages were sent from the leaders in

MILITARY ENCAMPMENT
FOR YOUNG WOMEN
President Wilson Made
Address
at
Opening In Washington.
Washington. May 1. America re
awakened in national spirit through
lessons of the war in Europe was the
theme of an address by President Wil
son today at the opening of the na
tional service school military encamp
ment for young women. In concluding,
the president voiced a warning that
the honor and integrity of the United
States cannot be tampered with. He
prayed that the country should not be
drawn into war, but declared that, if it
should be "in the great voice of na
tional enthusiasm which would be
raised all the world would stand once
more thrilled to hear the voice of the
New World asserting the standards of
Justice and liberty."
The president expressed confidence
that in time of trouble the great mass
of foreign-born citizens of the United
States would be loyal. "I never had
the slightest doubt of what would hap
pen when America called upon thorr
of her citizens born in other countries
to come to the support of the flag,"
he said. "Why, they will come with
cheers, they will come with a momen
tum which will make us realize that
America has once more been cried
awake out of every sort of distemper
and dream and distraction and that
any man who dares tamper with the
spirit of America will be cast out of
the confidence of a great nation upon
the instant."
MAN KILLED IN RUNAWAY
ACCIDENT AT SLMSBURY.
Wedged Between-Wagon and Tree and
Fatally Crushed.
SImsbury, Conn., May 1. John
Janesco, 2fl years old, was killed in a
runaway accident here today when the
horses attached to a heavy furniture
van on which he was riding from the
Weatogue section of the town with his
family and household goods to their
new home in West Hartford took fright
and got beyond the driver's control.
The wagon crashed into a tree at the
roadside and Janesco was caught be
tween it and the tree. So tightly was
he wedged there that he could not be
removed for some time until help had
been secured. He was hurried to a
hospital at Hartford, but died soon af
ter reaching it.
His wife and three children, while
bruised and shaken up, suffered no se
rious injury. The furniture was scat
tered, anoutjand the wagon badly

According to the" 'driver, something
about the wagon or harness gave way
as they were goinr down a small in
cline, frightening the horses.
INCREASED TAXES QUIETLY
RECEIVED IN IRELAND.
Races, Picture Shows and Football
Games Will Be Chief Producers.
Dublin, Ireland, May 1. The new
budget, with its increased taxes and its
new imposts, has been very quietly re
ceived in Ireland. The farmers are
relieved by the absence of any taxation
on land. The community at large Is
happy(fo have escaped any increase in
the charges on tea, beer and spirits.
Ireland will pay her full share of the
increased sugar duty, but cocoa, coffee
and table waters are less freely used
here than in Great Britain.
The new tax on amusements will
yield a 'considerable revenue in Ire
land. The races, picture shows and
football games will be the chief pro
ducers. The war has killed Rugby
football in this country, but associa
tion football flourishes in the north
and Gaelic football was never so popu
lar in the south. One of the Gaelic
county final matches last year attract
ed an attendance of over 100,000.
Dublin" carrying the news that the
movement had collapsed and ordering
the various rebels bodies to surrender.
Transporting Prisoners.
Monday "ijoday came .the news that
all the rebel leaders had surrendered
and that the total number of prison
ers taken the day previous in Dub
lin had reached 1,000. The trans
portation of captured rebels to Eng
land was in full swing and it became
known that nearly 500 of them had
been sent across the channel. There
was further submission of bodies out
side the city, notably of the Ennls
corthy rebels who had been holding
out persistently, but who were an
nounced to have unconditionally sur
rendered. Greatest Sufferers Were Peaceable
Citizens.
Reverting to the beginning of the
outbreak, it is known that the author
ities, although fully recognizing Its
seriousness, were certain from the
first that the rebels would be sup
pressed in a reasonably short time
after the first surprise. Lord Wim
borne, the Lord Lieutenant,, express
ed confidence of this from the start.
The greatest sufferers from the is
turbances were the hundreds of thous
ands of peaceable citizens, men, wo
men and children, who were compelled
to remain indoors and were unable to
obtain sufficient food, although there
were ample stores in the city. The
authorities early began organizing re
lief for these people and on Friday
and Saturday women and children
were escorted in grpups to provision
aepots wnere large supplies were
handed out.
Dublin Again Normal.
By Saturday night Dublin had re-
framed almost its normal aspect ex
cept for a number of smouldering
fires. The stores had not yet open
ed, but the streets were illuminated
and In view of the events of the week
that had pased it was interesting to
read the motto of the city on each
Ian to which in Latin says:
"When citizens are obedient peace
reigns in tne city.
Dublin Soldiers Indignant.
The Dublin soldiers and the Irish
regiments in the garrisons of Dublin
who bore the brunt . of the first day's
outbreak, expressed great indignation
over the uprising, occurring, as It aid,
at a time when the British empire
was fighting a great war. Some ex
pressed regret that English regiments
had been brought to suppress the dis
turbance, as they thought the English
soldiers were inclined to treat
rebels too- leniently.

AMERICA A GREAT POWER
IN THE WORLD OF FASHION.
England Resents Adoption of Our Ideas
' for Women- Apparel;"
London, May 1. England has at last
awakened to the fact that America has
become a great power in the world of
fashion, and that many of the ideas
for women's apparel which formerly
came from France now emanate from
New York.
A London morning paper publishes a
long editorial appealing to the govern
ment to protect home industries by
clapping a heavy duty on styles im
ported from New York. It says, in
part:
"Especially should we come down hot
and strong on American fashions. Our
French allies are concentrating their
energies on the war so closely that
Paris fashions have almost ceased to
exist, and America Is making frantic
efforts to establish herself as t the
maker of the mode.
"This is very natural, but she may
very well be made to pay for her op
portunity. She has always made
France and England pay for dresses
imported into the states, and this is a
very- legitimate occasion for retalia
tion.
"It is hardly ' decent In war time for
women to wear fashionable dresses at
all, yet if the fashions came from
Paris we ehould find it difficult to
place an embargo on them. Luckily we
are not faced with that dilemma, and
can impose a trifling duty on dresses
from Paris and a very heavy one on
dresses from America. Every imported
model for fashionable wear should be
made to bear a government stamp."
