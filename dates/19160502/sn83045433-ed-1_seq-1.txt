At Women's
President Wilson yesterday formally
opened the girls' "war" camp of the Na
tional Service School at Chevy Chase
with ant address of praise for the fair
Ct identa in preparing themselves to aid
the nation in time of peril.
The President delivered the address
from a flag-draped stand in the new city
of tents while Mrs. Wilson and more
than 310 khaki-clad girls and women lis
tened in rapt attention.
President Wilson spoke for the first
time on the glories instead of the horrors
of war. He told of the spiritual regener
ation he believed would come upon the
United States should it be compelled to
make the great pftriotic sacrifices en
tailed by participation in war.
Would Shake Off Dream.
"God forbid that we should be drawn
into nar," said the President, with im
pressivo solemnity., "hut if we should be,
America woild seem: once more to shake
herself out of a dream, to say. 'Did any
man deem that we were asleep? Did any
man deem that we had forgotten the tra
d!tions of America? Did any man deem
that he could tamper 'ith the honor or
the ingrity of the i'United States?' And
in the great voice of national enthusiasm
which would he raised all the world

tal attitude since the early days of his
administration, when he declared with
uplifted hand to an aged woman who
visited him in his office: "Madam, there
never will be a war while I am Presi
dent."
In some quarters the speech was re
garded not only as a further warning to
Germany, but as having been deliberate
iy planned to prepare the country for
the momentous step the President will
feel obliged to take if one of the Kaiser's
submarines sinks another ship in defiance
of international law.
The President cited the nationalizing
influence of the present war upon the
nations already engaged in it and added
that people in America have been think
ing too much about their individual
selves and too little about the country
of which they constitute a part. The
President expressed the belief that a
certain regeneration will result even
from America's experiences thus far in
the present war.
The President again expressed hi., great
faith in the loyalty of foreign-born Amer
lia Warned of Danner..
P resident Wilson said in part:
If the present war has done nothing
else, it has at least done this: it has
ode America ware of dangers which
most of us had deemed unr al. and has
made us aware that the danger of our
own time is nothing less than the un
iettlenit of th' founilations of ivi
lizat ion.

sate that it leaves no loophole for any
thing hut a definte ar-d radical change
in Germany's subnarine campaign w hich
brings their operations ortuarel. within
the, recognized dictates of intednational
law.
Either Germany must operate with her
submarines as any helligerert would
operate with wareraft of any kind in
intercepting merchant vessels or she must
give up the use of the submarine for this
hind of work.
No setret is made of the fact that
both President Wilson And Secretary
Lansing regard the American note as
rendering the emlcient use of submarines
against commerce-carriers impossible.
The plain intimation that the United
States wi!i not budge from this conten

from Berlin.
