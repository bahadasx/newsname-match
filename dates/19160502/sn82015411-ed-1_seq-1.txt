FOR THIS ISLAND?
The following interesting story
appeared in a Honolulu paper which
arrived at Lihue this morning:
In song and story the well-known
expression "On the Road to Man
dalay" will be changed to "On the
Road to llanalei" if the plans of
the Kauai boosters go through.
The people of Kauai are now work
ing on a road over the mountains
from Waimea to Hanalei which
when completed will be called the
Road of Ten Thousand Wonders.
Running along close to the cliffs
which stand like sentinels guarding
the shoreline, 'and then through val
leys and over the mountains the
road will bring out wonderful scenic
possibilities a s yet undeveloped.
This section is rich with wonders of
every description, and those who
have made the trip state that when
the road is completed it will be sec
ond to none in the value of scenery.
Na Pali, which is acknowledged
to bo one of the beauty spots of all
Hawaii, will be reached by the new
road, and the roadway will wind
around close to precipices, of which
there an hundreds. The news of
the project was given out yesterday
at a meeting of the Hawaii Promo
tion Committee, and all of the mem
bers were enthusiastic in regard to
the project.
"A mine rich in jewels will be
developed," said Albert P. Tay
lor, when asked regarding the
building of the scenic road. "This
scenic section will be startling to
the average tourist, and will with
out doubt prove to be a mine to
Hawaii. Kauai has taken note of
Gray's Elegy and the flower that
wasborn to blush unseen will in
the future not be wasted on the
desert air," he concluded. It is
expected that the road will be com
pleted some time next year.
Some Swords Arrive
Twenty-five swords arrived by
the steamer Friday morning for
officers of the Fourth Infantry, N.
G. II., above lieutenants, and were
distributed by the Quartermaster.
Swords for the other officers will
be along veiv shoitly.

their lights are so bright.
Also, on the Kekaha side we

IVE WISI
FIFTY YEARS AGO
The following is from the pen
of Rev. J. M. Lydgate:
From the Kuokoa, Hawaiian
newspaper, of Dec. 17, 1S66, we
translate ibis wise bit of advice,
which is no less wise now than it
was then.
PLANT COCOANUTS !
Listen my Friends of the Garden
and Field ! Let us plant cocoa
nuts ! In the good old days of
the Chiefs, the ea shores were
beautitul with cocoanut groves;
but in these degenerate days of
their descendants, the groves are
dying, and soon that most beau
tiful of Hawaiian trees will be a
thing of the past.
To my fancy, the beauty of
this our own home grown tree, far
outruns any of the foreign trees
the haoles have brought here.
These malihini trees are all very
well, but the glory of Hawaii is
the cocoanut.
It is the anxious desire of this
one Hawaiian, at any rate to see
in mv old age the waving groves,
as in the days of my vouth. and
more. In those days the land all
belonged to the chiefs, and the
groves belonged" to the chiefs.
Now we own our kuleanas. and
every man can plant a few trees
near his little home, and enjoy
them.
Where are you my friends ! The
cocoanut is a valuable thing ! You
can sell them for ten cents apiece,
and a good tree will vicld one
hundred nuts a year, that gives
you $10 a year. Sugar cane isn't
in it with that ! Besides that the
leaves are valuable for thatch, and
the fibre for rope. The captains
coming up from the south tell us
about this fine rope that they get
there, o n those small islands,
made out of cocoanut fibre, and
they want to know what's the
matter with us, that we don't
plant cocoanuts, and make rope.
Sure enough ! We ought to be
ashamed! Well, I planted ten
trees when I got mv little kulcana,
and thev are bearing generously
now; but as I realize that these
ten trees can't live forever, I am
going to plant a lot more. Now
let us all do the same thing, and
then, three; four, or five years
from now, we will see, nil alonj
the shore of Hawaii, the feathery
plumes of myriads cocoanuts way.
