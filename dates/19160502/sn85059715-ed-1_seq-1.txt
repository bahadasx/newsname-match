. SWEEPING DISTRICT
Nomination of Harrison County,
Statesman for Congress in
This District Certain.
VOTERS STRONG FOR HIM
Press in District Reflects Senti
ment Which Shows This
a Reed Year.
Stuart F. Rood, well known and
popular secretary of sta:e, is among
the distinguished Republicans of th^
stnt** in attendance at the Third con
gressional district delegate conven
tion at Weston today, where there
are rallied to him party men of en
thusiastic loyalty, men of all walks
of life and fast friends of this well
known state leader in politics, edu
cation, religion, fraternalism and
every other activity tending to pro
mote the welfare and development
of the state, its citizenry and its in
stitutions. a man who has led the
party to many triumphs and never
to defeat. But few men in public
life anywhere can lay claim to being;
a never defeated candidate. Like
the name of our own illustrious Goff
that of Reed, so far as Stuart F. is
concerned, has ever proved one of
magic.
Secretary Reed, as Is known every
where in the new Third congression
al district, is a candidate for the Re
publican nomination in the district
tor Congress, and it certainly Is lit -
ting and the part of wisdom that such
a man as he should be the first con
gressman from ihe district. There
Is no shadow of doubt that thousands
of citizens in this new district feel
that way about it. The forecast as
made by Senator Reed's friends and
campaign workers indicate that he
will sweep the district' on primary
election day, the counties of which
have all been strong for him in past
campaigns and election statistics of
which show that he was an easy
leader in what now comprises the
district, when he was elected secre
tary of state.
Mr. Reed himself is making a very
thorough and systematic campaign,
so characteristic of the man. and ho
Is most enthusiastic over the outlook
for his nomination June 6. There >
is wide-spread sentiment for Reed's
nomination, say his friends all
through the district', which has so
cr.vstalized that they say it is all over'
but the shouting. Everywhere the;
slogan is: "Reed is the Right Man;
We Will Run Him and Win in a!
Walk."
The press of the district is also
practical unanimous for Mr. iteed's j
nomination, and no man ever had
warmer tributes paid him than he.
To reproduce all of them would be
to fill a big volume. Suffice it to give
a few.
Here is what the editor of the
Weston Republican says of Mr. Reed
in his newspaper:
In this issue appears the announce
ment of Stuart F. Reed for Congress
from the Third district. To say Mr.
Reed is competent to 1111 the position
is not merely a political compliment.;

PURE WATER PLANT
IS IN OPERATION NOW
New Industry Will Appeal Very.
Strongly to All Who Believe
in a Healthy Drink.
A representative of the Telegram j
inspected the plant of the Clarksburg
Trlpure Water Company, operated by
A. Fred Wagner, this morning and j
found it to br very interesting in
every detail of the business. Thic
company has just installed a plant
on Baltimore street and is now pre
pared to deliver to the citizens of
Clarksburg and throughout the sur
rounding country the Trlpure water,
"the purest water In the world."
This company was organized by well
known business people and will re
ceive liberal patronage as one of tli?
newest Industries of the city.
Mr. Wagner, of the Clarksburg
Bottling Works, becoming Interested
In the Trlpure water product and j
learning that the Trlpure Water 8ys-i
teins Company, of Washington, D. C.,|
was establishing Trlpure water com
panies throughout the United States'
and Canada, secured for bis company!
the necessary territorial rights for |
Clarksburg and the counties adja
cent thereto.. He has installed a
Trlpure Mill. which has a capacity of
1,200 gallons a day, together with
other machinery and apparatus to|
ir^ke an up-to-date Trlpure plant.
The Midi KivM* the water three puri
fications; flrsi by boiling. In which
*il? thi case* are removed; second, by
? .npjr*. oti. i . which the preheated
*\at?*r >s converted into wteam; third.!
by introducing i-tcrHlzed air into the
steam at the moment of condensa
tion. Trlpure water Is not llat nor;
insipid, but is sweet, palatable and j
of remarkable purity. It 'h free from
gcrmfl and bacteria am. devoid of
mineral r.ubstance. The Trlpure
stills and name are fully protected i
b; patents and trade marks.
The extreme care which Is taken
In bottling and preserving the purity
of Trlpure water Is worthy of men-,
tion. Before filling, ail bottles are
cleansed In a large take-In of water
and then placed In a metal sterilizer
where live steam is turned on them
at 220 degrees or better. No corks
are used. Caps are provided, lined1
with pure block tin, and the company
has installed the very best capping,
machine to Insure the doing of this
work so that the bottles will be ab
solutely air tight. The water will
be put up In Ave gallon bottles fori
use In olilce or home, and also in1
j handy triangular bottles of smaller
capacity holding five pints.
It Is noted that all parts and pipes
which come in contact with Trlpure
water are lined with pure block tin.
f which protects the water from any
I chemical change by contact.
The company will also place on
the market carbonated sweet goods.
These beverages are made from the
very purest syrups and ingredients,
no artificial substances or coloring
matters are used. It Is expected that
the delivery of trlpure water and
products will commence within a few
days, the company having orders on
hand to take the whole output some
time ahead.
This enterprise Is a worthy one,
being along the lines of the much
discussed pure water for drinking
purposes as well as for medicinal
and technical uses, and should meet
with the support and patronage of
the people.

Brilliant Young Lawyer is One
Whose Candidacy Bings

VERY STRONG CANDIDATE
Reception by Press and People
Clearly Reflects His Nomi
nation on June 6.
(Fly R. Ad Hull, ICditor Weston Free
Press.)
If you mny Judge from the news
peper comments on candidacies, It in
sa#e to Buy thnt no other announce
mont for nttomoy general Iiuh met
with more popular favor thnn has
that of lllrk Smith StatherH. of Wes.
ton. From every part of the state
the newspapers have received his
candidacy with much acclaim, and
thin inuh( have hoen but the echo of
approval of the people. Despite the
tendency to center attention on the
contests for the nominations for gov
ernor and for United States senator,
there has been much publicity con
cern In k the Htathors candidacy, and
publicity, as every newspaper man
knows, grows out of the things that
are doing; It reflects public sentiment
Just as surely as It helps to mould It.
Mr. Stathers was born at Middle
bourne. Tyler county. July 13, 1884.
When he was very young his parents
movod to Wheeling, where ho lived
until 1897, when he moved to Wes
ton, where he has since had his home.
He graduated from the Weston high
school In 1901. In the following
year he wont direct to the West Vir
ginia University, and was graduated
with the degree of bachelor of arts
In 1906. A year later he completed
the course in law at the same Insti
tution, receiving the degree of bache
lor of laws, lie was admitted to tho
bar In 1897, and Immediately asso
ciated himself with W. W. Brannon,
of Weston. In the practice of his pro
fession. He had only had tho advant
age of association with one of tho
strongest lawyers In the state, but ho
learned from him how to win by hard
application, careful preparation, and
thorough mastery of his case. If the
school at Morgantown prepared him
for entrance upon the practico of law,
the study of the law through practico
has proven the even more valuable
school of experience to prepare him
for practical service to the people In
Just such a position as he now seeks.
No man of his yoar has a more thor
ough grasp of the law as applied to
actual practice.
Before launching his candidacy for
this nomination, the careful and as
tute young lawyer took pains to
thoroughly sound tho sentiment In
practically every part of tho state,
and from every direction there came
such encouraging word that friendly
advisers shared his belief that his
nomination was well nigh assured.
Subsequent events have strengthened
tho opinion, and In going up and
down the state such assurances have
come as Indicate that he has not mis
taken the will of the people among
