gia avenue park today for front seats1
for the final game with the champions.
The fans began moving early to the

of rooters on hand long before the game

POLICE PAY
House District Committee
Agrees to Report Increase
Measure.
After agreeing to report the Senate
bill for an Increase tn .the pay of cer
tain members of the police force, the
House District Committee today voted
to hold a special meeting on Friday
night to consider the police and fire
mon's pension bill, and the Page "loan
shark" measure.
It Is claimed that the present 1-cent
rate for small loans makes It Impossible
for any loan company successfully to
do business In this city, and that cer
tain companled have moved Just beyond
the District line, where poor borrowers
are paying anywhere from 10 to 100 per
cent on loans. Congressman Page's bill
Is a compromise between the present
low rate and the old 3 per cent law.
Reports Not Assured.
It Is not assured that t he District
Committee will report either the pen
sion bill or the "loan shark" measure
Friday night. Both bills have oppon
ents In tho committee, hut the friends
of the measure hope for favorable ac
tion after a full discussion at the ap
proaching special meeting. Police and
firemen are appealing to their liends In
Congress to support pension .legislation,
which has been sought from year to
Vlflr.
The renort bv the committee of the
Smith bill will bring considerable
comfort to the police rorce.
Rapid Promotion.
This bill, which recently was ap
proved by the Senate, provides for
more rapid promotion of privates of
the police force and authorises salary
Increases for the various officers of
the rorce. The salary or a captain

$1,400.
An Increase of $60 Is authorised for

effoct of solidifying the organisation, of
the women students who are taking the
special training, Into a splendidly work
ing camp machine.
No Stragglcra In Camp.
Results of tho first day In camp are
pparent everywhere. A business-like
atmosphere prfvades the place. The
students report promptly at their lec
tures. There has so far been no neces
sity for a "provost guard" to round up
me stragglers.
The new khaki uniforms In which
the young women appear, are begin
ning to show the wrinkles of rani
service, and whisper! the hot sun
today ana yesterday already has be
sun to work marvelous changes In
complexions. The creamy tints are
giving way to the red hue of Incipient
sunburn.
When revelle sounded over the camp
at 6:30 o'clock thla morning, the 300
young worsen students, tumbling
from sixty-five service tents, attested
the falsity. In this particular Instance,

NORMAL LIFE RESUMING
Last Volley Fired by Insurgents
Last Night as Movement
Collapses.
By WILBUR S. FORREST,
United Press Staff Correspondent.
DUBLIN, May 2. At least BOO rebels
were killed and 1,500 wounded In the
seven days of fighting In the streets
of Dublin, It Is estimated by soldiers
who completed a canvass of the city
today.
This estimate Is conservative, of
ficers said. Rebel bodies were found
beneath the ruins of the general post
office, wrecked by British shell fire, In
Llborty hall and In a number of other
buildings demolished by artillery or
burned to the ground.
The number of casualties Is far In
excess of early estimates, and many
bodies are believed to lie beneath
ruins still unsearched.
The Dublin hospitals are overflowing
with wounded, Including many wom
en and children non-combatants. As
rapidly as possible parsons suffering
from slight wounds are discharged to
make room for those whose condition
Is more serious.
Last Volley Fired.
Lord Donoughmore, former com
mander of the British forces In Egypt
and a former member of the British
cabinet. Is among the wounded. He
was shot while motoring to his coun
try home north of Dublin, escaping.
however, with only a flesh wound.
A small body of rebels, determined
to die hard, fired the last volley of the
Dublin rebellion last night from a
position near the Westland station,
which was captured by the rebels
early last week. The crackle or gov
errlment machine guns. followed Then
ominous sllebce. The whole party had
been wiped out.
Probably the last shot was fired bv a
rebel sniper, concealed tn the tower of
the gas works. He sent three bullets
toward a party of correspondents board
ing a tug In tho Llffey river. Officers
said that several rebel fanatics, with
out food, are stltl holding out, but that
they lit be brought In within a few
nours
Resuming Normal Life.
The city Is resuming Its normal life.
Bhops are reopening and the people of
Dublin are getting their first square

his home at Black Rock, Ireland, near
Kingstown, went to Dublin on Monday
and was one of the soldiers captured by
ine reoeis. tie was imprisoned in a
building In Four Courts, one of the last
areas to be surrendered to the govern
ment forces. He said he was given onlv
bread and water for five days though
the rebels were well supplied with food,
as well as ammunition.
"The rank and file of the rebels ex
pected about what they got," he said.
'Their leader, the schoolmasters and
other Intellectuals, were fanatically en
thusiastic the first few days, and then
most uejectea wnen tney saw tneir plans
fall."
An eye-witness asserts that the Coun
tess Marklevlcz. dressed entirely In
green, led a rebel force to the gate of
Dublin Cestle and personally fired the
first shot from her revolver In the at
tack on the castle. The shot killed a
policeman.

BERLIN. May 2. Germany's reply to
the American note demanding a change

Homo few alterations may be made In
its text. But these will not alter the

By E. T. CONKLE.
EL PASO, Tex., May 2. Tho
conference between Generals
Scott and Funston and Carranza
War Minister Obregon, was ex
pected to reach a dead-lock today.
What are regarded as final in
structions to the American con
ferees arrived today from Wash
ington. General Scott stated that
the conference would be held this
afternoon. The time and place
was to be left to the convenience
of the Mexican members.

ADJOURNMENT EXPECTED.
Hcott planned to advise Obregon nt
tlclally of thla fact, and It was believed
the Carranza war minister would
promptly, but politely, refuse to discuss
any other subject until tbe problem of
troop withdrawal had been settled.
Under these circumstances andmrnedi
ate adjournment of the conference was
anticipated.
General Obrcgon's statement that the
entire matter would be referred to Gen
ral Carranza was believed to indicate
that the failure of tho conference will
be followed by diplomatic action rather
than by military operations, and renders
less likely any break
The date for tho

were trying tn bring about a situation
which will make an armed clash in
evitable. The general belief hero Is that they
will fall unless hot-heads among the
American or the Mexican army permit
a clash to occur which will be so serious
as to render pence Impossible.
Armies Now Inactive.
In tho meantime both the- Mexican and
American armies are Inactive. At some
points along the line taken by the
punitive exprdltion. the forces are only
a few miles apart. Mo alarm Is felt
hero for General Pershing's forces, as
hi has been so re-enforced, equipped,
and provisioned as to meet any situa
tion which might arise.
Thero are now 17.000 American soldiers
In Mexico, along the 300 miles trnm the
border to Namuiulpu, and protected by
entrenched and fortified camps.
General Kunstcn Is confident that this
force could not only hold out Indertnltely
against a much larger Mexican force,
but could actually take the offensive If
tt were desired.
I unston Said to Have
Aslccd For Militia
Carranza's demand for withdrawal of '
United States troops from Mexican soil
and this Government's flat refusal to
accede to the demand, will be brought
to a showdown today.
A lengthy code niefccage was sent to
General Scott by Secretary Uuker last
night. This was sent after Mr. llaker
had conferred at length with the Presi
dent and Secretary Lansing- Tho com
munication contained llual Instructions
to General Scott to resist to the last
demands for withdrawal.
A report from the border s.ild Gen
eral Funston had naked the War De
partment for re-enforceirionts from
the national guard, ifocri.-tary nakor
received a dispatch from Kunston lant
night. He refused to way whether t
contained n request for mllltK.
It Js known that General Funston
believes a call for tho militia will be
Immediately nocessury If tho present
etforts tc obtain co-oporotlon by
Carranza fall.
For Police Duty.
It may be authoritatively ntatod
that the Administration Is willing to
keep Its forces In northern Mexico, on
pollen duly, permitting Carranza to
continue the Villa chase. But no do-
1 inand for withdrawn! of tho 4mrlcnn
forco will be ontertalned at this
flm
Armed with full Instructions from
Washington, General Scott Is expected
to t'cnume his conferences with General
Obregon today. If any new hitch Is en-
countered General Scott Is expected to
ndvlse Washington at once so that the
Metlinn situation may be taken up for
I'nhlnet consideration today,
