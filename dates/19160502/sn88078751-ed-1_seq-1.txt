RE
Should The American Troops Remain
; In
Apprehensive Thai Came Govern
ment May Be Overthrown
El Paso, Tex., Slay 1. The insist
ence of General Alvaro Obregon, Mex
lean minister of war, that the Ameri
can troop3 bo withdrawn at once, was
tho harrier upon which tho conference
o? Mexican and United States military
peace commissioners split. General
Cbregon insisted that the American
troops must leave Mexico, not merely
because the Carranza government
wishs it, but because, he said, the
Carranza government is in actual dan
ger of being overthrown or at least of
facing a formidable revolution if this
does no take place. General Obregon
cited a recent nffalrMn Chihuahua City
,ln which, he said over 200 men were
arrested in a hall where they wore
plotting the death of Governor Gutier
rcz and all Carranza officers in tint
state because the Carranza govern
ment had permitted the American
troops In Mexico. This affair, ho said,
was much more serious than the bor
der ever know, and other and similar
affairs might bo expected all over the
country if the American troops were
permitted to remain in Mexico by the
fle facto government without resist
ance. In reply General Scott laid before
the Mexican officials another phase
that might endanger the Carranza
regime to a greater extent than the
danger at home. General Scott told
General Obregon that the American
reople aro in such a frame of mind
that If their troops were withdrawn
and another raid should take place
similar to the affair at Columbus, it
would be Impossible to stem the de
mand for an immediate invasion of
war on Mexico. In view of this Gen
eral Scott Informed General Obregon
that It would be possible for Mexico
to accept tho co-operation of the
American troops 'in curbing the ban-

London, May 1. With the settling

"Irish republic" passed Into history.
U had lived a little more than 120
hcurs. Proudly triumphantly It set
