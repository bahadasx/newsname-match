That Is Keal lieason for Re
questing Withdrawal.
De Facto Minister Appeals to
Washington Officials.
MEXICAN POPULATION UNEASY
Growing Suspicion Over Pres
ence of U. S. Troops.
But That U. S. Soldiers Will Re
main Is Settled.
Washington. May 2. Generals Scott
and Funston at the border today had
further instructions from Secretary
Baker on which it was expected they
would resume negotiations with Gen
eral Olregon, Carranzas war minister.
These orders telegraphed last night do
not alter the administration's attitude
toward the withdrawal of the troops
from Mexican territory, it was said.
Although no formal demand has
been made by representatives of the de
facto government for the withdrawal
of the American troops the Mexican
minister in discussing affairs with
American officers here is layins em
phasis on the declaration that longer
occupation by American troops is re
ducing the de facto government's au
thority. After a conference with Secretarv
Lansing yesterday he declared that the
suspicion is growing ar-.ong the Mex
ican people that American soldiers are
remaining now for some other purpose
than to pursue Villa bandits. He stat
ed that there is no doubt Villa's power
is completely crushed, even if the ban
dit leader is not dead. Consequently,
the Americans have no good reason
for continuing their occupation, he de
clared. Renew Conference Today.
El Pa;io, May 2. "With the question
of immediate" withdrawal" definitely
disposed of in the latest instructions
from Se-re;n: Baker, the conference
of Generals Scott, Funston and Obre
fjon here today on future American
troops movements in Mexico appeared
to reach a concrete and perhaps final
stage.
It was the opinion of the American
conferees tiat the second meeting with
General Obrcijon and General Trevino
would come in the afternoon and it
was believed possible that the object of
the conference might then be realized.
Basis for this belief was not ex
plained except in supposition that ne
gotiations are nearing a phase where
only an acceptance or rejection of one
or the other side's proposals is possi
ble. General Scott and General Fun
ston were busy until a late hour lasc
night decoding dispatches from Wash
ington. What Does "Immediate" Mean?
Well informed persons here are in
clined to place considerable stress on
Secretary Baker's use of the word "im
mediate" in connection with with
drawal. They interpret the assertion
that there could be no agreement
reached by the conference on the ba
sis of an immediate retirement as
moaning that the United States might
consider withdrawal after a reason
able length of time, providing that in
the meantime the object of the expe
ditionary force was accomplished
through sincere co-operation by the
Mexican army with the Americans.
Confer This Afternoon.
Kl Paso. May 2. General Scott an
nounced at noon that the second con
ference with General Obregon will be
held this afternoon on the American
side of the international boundry line.
The United States immigration office
at the international bridge has been
selected as the place for holding the
conference.

Ijake Shore and Nickel Plate railroads
between Chicago and New York have
received instructions to strike Thurs

The order was issued by H. B. Per

failed to come to an agreement with
A. H. Smith, president of the railroads
involved.
According to President Perham.
President Smith was willing to make
a satisfactory agreement with the tele
graphers, but refused to deal with the
signal men. Fifty of the latter, he
said, had been discharged for organiz
ing. The two organizations had
formed an alliance and both will take
part in the strike.

Douaumont, on the Verdun front. The
French captured a first line German
trench 500 metres long, the war of
fice announced this afternoon, and
took 100 men prisoner.
West of the River Meuse activity
of the artillery continued through the
night from the Avocourt region to
Dead Man Hill. The war office also
announced that in their attacks on
April 29 and 30 on the north slope of
Dead Man's Hill, the French gained
German trenches over a front of about
1,000 metres and a depth of 300 to 600
metres.
Peace Again in Ireland.
Dublin, May 1. Via London, May 2.
Quiet reigned in the streets of Dub
lin today. There was little traffic and
the thoroughfares were slightly held
by the miliary forces of the govern
ment. Only a few sniping shots were
heard Sunday night. It is assumed
the Sinn Feiners still at liberty have
hidden their arms, after using all their
ammunition, and rejoined the ranks
of peaceable citizens.
A shortage o food, has caused much
distress in several districts but with
the resumption of almost normal con
ditions the committee charged with
looking after the needs of the popula
tion expects to relieve those in want
within a short time.
It is impossible to. get from one part
of Dublin to another without a mili
tary permit. No one is allowed to
pass the bridges and merchants resid
ing in the suburbs are in most cases
quite ignorant pf what has happened
to their shops, factories and ware
houses in the- city.
Military Rule Strict.
Soldiers are completing a thorough
search of the -city and it is hoped that
within a few hours they will account
for the last of the snipers, a small
band of rebels which has beer, causing
diversion in the neighborhood of Balls
bridge. This band has subjected to
artillery fire Monday afternoon. A
few of the rebels are holding out.

nounced today.
NEWTiTPLAN
Holders of 20 Million Bonds
Promote Scheme.
Hope to Induce Stockholders to
Buy "ew Stock Issue.
Chicago, May 2. A new plan for
the reorganization of the Chicago,
Rock Island and Pacific railway is be
ing formulated by the protective com
mittee representing holders of the
$20, 000. 000 five per cent debenture
bonds, it was announced today. It is
understood the terms will be made
public as soon as it is definitely deter
mined that the plan promulgated by
N. L. Amster, as chairman of a stock
holders' committee has failed of
adoption by the stockholders.
Seward Prosser, president of the
Bankers' Trust company of New York
and chairman of the debenture com
mittee, and Speyer and Company are
understood to be the principal inter
ests back of the new plan.
The debenture committee, it is re
ported, is in favor of reorganization
along lines providing for an issue of
preferred stock, in exchange for the
debentures. tt will offer the stock
holders an opportunity to subscribe to
the new preferred stock to provide the
additional capital needed to pay off
the receivers certificates r.nd furnish
funds for improvements. As an in
ducement to the old stockholders to
buv the new preferred stock, it is sug
gested that they receive new common
stock as a bonus.

cording to C. E. Drayer of Cleveland,
O., chairman of the committee on en
gineering co-operation of the en

States, who today is completing an in
dex which will contain the name of
each member, his address, experience
and engineering specialty. Said
Drayer: "We aim to see that our very
best men find their places where they
can best serve the interests of their
country."

THEY DENYREPORT
Railway Brotherhoods Say Mat
ter Is Beyond "Locals."
Santa Fe Heads Give Out Their
Position in Topeka.
A vigorious denial that representa
tives of the four railway brotherhoods i
on the "Western lines of the Atchison,
lopeka & Santa Fe are taking steps to
withdraw from the general demands
for an eight hour day with time and
half for overtime, was made this
morning by W. W. Hutton, chairman
of the Order of Railway Conductors
on the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe
lines, Mr. Hutton also denied the
authenticity of a report that engineers
on the Union Pacific lines have de
cided to withdraw from the confer
ence.
"The matter has passed entirely be- 1
yond the locals," Mr. Hutton declares, j
"The movement for an eight hour day !
with time and a half for all overtime
was endorsed by every local in the j
four orders and the story that the men
now wish to withdraw is preposter-1
OUB." . ,
Mr. Hutton has kept in close touch, j
not only with the affairs of his own j
order but the trend of events in the j
other three organizations as they af- ,
feet the eight hour movement, he says. 1
And nowhere, he insists, is there any j
organized attempt to withdraw.
Reports have been received that two !
engineers on the Eastern lines o the
Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe have ex- ;
pressed themselves as being opposed
to the movement. Mr. Hutton admits.
The two engineers, however, voted in
favor of the demands at the time a
vote was taken, he says. '
"Ah far as we have been able to j
learn, the two engineers on the east
ern lines of the Santa Fe are the only
ones in the country that have shown
any disposition to step out of line.
And the position of these two men is
not pronounced enough to warrant
action by the Brotherhoods."
Too Late to Withdraw,
Members of the Brotherhoods who
attempt to withdraw from the de
mands now do so at the risk of for
feiting membership in the organiza
tions and thereby losing insurance
carried there, according to Hutton.
Insurance carried by the men runs be
tween $1,000 and $5,000.
"The eight hour proposition was
checked squarely up to the locals and
the vote left, no room for doubt as to
action expected of the officials," Hut
ton stated. "Without any question,
there will be no attempt to break away
from the general conference."
Preliminary steps for the general
conference, in which committees rep
resenting railways of the country and
the four brotherhoods will participate,
are now being taken, according to
Hutton.
Rumors of dissension in the ranks
of the brotherhoods has been current
in railway circles for some time. Rail
road officials declare that engineers
who have been in the service for a
number of years and are approaching
the age when they will be entitled to
pensions are not looking with favor
on a break that will sweep away all
the benefits that have accrued to them
by virtue of their term of servce.
Reports Vn verified.
Mr. Kouns this morning was unable
to verify a report from Albuquerque
that members of the brotherhoods on
the western lines of the road had de
cided to withdraw from he general
conference. F. C. Fox, general man
ager at Amarillo, Tex., ie in charge of
that territory.
"The report does not come as a
surprise, however," Mr. Kouns de
clares. "Reports have come to us
that many engineers on our lines are
desirous of withdrawing from the
case. Especially is this true of the
older men."
"Mr. Kouns will leave for New York
Saturday to attend a preliminary
meeting of the committee that will
represent the railways in the confer
ence and to which Mr. Kouns has been
appointed. At that meeting the rail
roads probably will agree on the stand
that will oe taken when the confer
ence opens.

Tacoma, Wash., May 2. Great in

which continued today of Paul R.
Haffer. accused of criminal libel by
an attack on George Washington in a
letter published in a newspaper. The
prosecution is based on a state statute
designed to protect the memory of the
dead. The letter asserted that Wash

holder."
Col. Albert E. Joab, of this city, the
complainant, called as a witness for
the defense, was asked why he had
filed the complaint.
"When I read the article," said
Colonel Joab. "I felt as if I had been
struck a blow in the face."
Are you a relative of the- de

"No immediate relation." he an

GOOD AS AN AR
Roosevelt as President Equiva

Nations Then Will Know That
We Mean Business.
Chicago, May 2. Frank P. MacLen
nan, editor of the Topeka State Jour
nal, the leading evening newspaper of
Kansas, is one of the latest converts
to Theodore Roosevelt for president,
said the Tribune this morning. In 1912
he was a Taft partisan..
Mr. MacLennan was -in Chicago last
night and explained his new alle
giance. "We need a statesman of Roosevelt's
caliber in the White House," he said.
"If he is nominated by the Republican
convention in June, it will be equiv
alent to several new dreadnaughts and
a new army of 100,000 trained men.
Then the other nations would know we
meant business.
"As a matter of fact, Europe has
bluffed Wilson from start to finish and
as a consequence we are losing the re
spect of the nations. Wilson has blun
dered in Mexico and has blundered in
Europe. Now it looks as if he may be
about to blunder in Japan.
"But there is one thing I would like
to say about Roosevelt. He has
smoothed over the misunderstanding
with Root. Why can't he do it with
Taft?"

Washington, May 2. Nearly the en
tire program of the National Conser

day was given over to discussion of
mobilizing the country's natural re
sources for national defense. The
congress called its meeting a confer

president of the congress, in his open
ing address said:
"The four watchwords are conserva

competency, no useless expenditure of

DEMANDS LABOR
Workers Want to Share in
Prosperity, Says Gompers.
Better Understanding Will Be
Result of Strikes.
BY SAMTFli GOMPERS.
President of the American Federation
of Labor.
Washington, May 2. American la
boring men today have a general real
ization of the fact that they are en
titled to a just share in the tremendous
wave of prosperity sweeping all over
this country. The strikes incident to
their efforts to enforce this right are
not indications that iiiey are trying to
take advantage .of an accidental situa
tion. They merely claim their due
and equitable share :n the greatest in
dustrial boom of history.
Too long has the American laboring
man been compelled to share in de-pr-?sion
and failed to share in periods
of greater prosperity.
It is too early to discuss the effects
of the present widespread demands for
readjustments. Personally, I lo not
even yet know Just, how far-reaching
they are.
Laborers Optimistic.
I have just returned from New York
and Philadelphia, where I conferred
with labor leaders. These conferences
and the information I have led me to
this conclusion: That union labor is
justified in being optimistic about
every reasonable demand.
This is shown in the attitude of
those employers of sympathy and un
derstanding who already have grasped
the situation and have met employees
half way. Employers more and mor
are treating with employees in a
friendly spirit.
Therefore, it is reasonable to sus
pect that this agitation may result in
an understanding which will give the
working man in the vast majority of
cases a square deal and that the ef
fects of the disputes will be highly
beneficial to both employees and employers.

Vote 10 to 1 to End It.
Pittsburg. Pa., May 2. Three men
were killed and seven wounded when
the mob which has been attacking
manufacturing plants in the Turtle
Creek and Monongahela Valleys
throughout the day charged the Thir
teenth street entrance of the Edgar
Thomas Steel company's plant at
Braddock this afternoon. ,
The mob charged the gates leading
to the mill and was driven back by
deputy sheriffs. Reforming a little
farther down the street, it made an
other rush and attempting to scale the
fence was met with a volley from the
guards' revolvers. This halted the
rush again and the crowd retired.
Sheriff Richards at once conferred
with state officials asking that the
national guard be ordered to the dis
turbed section tonight.
3,000 lrive Out Workmen.
A mob of three thousand strik
ers from the Turtle Creek val
ley, armed with clubs and stones
entered Braddock today, marched to
the plant of the Sterling Steel Foun
dry company, and forcing entrance
drove the men from their machines
and smashed windows and otherwise
moved on a contractors place where
more damage was done, but no one
-fwiured. Paul Cinak, said to be one of ;
the leaders, was arrested.
Leaders of the crowd then reformed
their lines, and declared they were
preparing to move on the Carnegie
works at Homestead. The plant, it
was stated, was well guarded.
Appeals for help were received from
the Carnegie plant and Sheriff Rich
ards sent a force of deputies to assist
the men on duty. Several plants In
the Braddock and Rankin districts
were closed down today when pickets
appeared. This action added about
8,000 men to those already idle as the
result of strikes.
Vote 10 to 1 to End Car Strike. ,;
