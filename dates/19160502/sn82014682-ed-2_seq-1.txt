Instead of onietlnr down, as was
anticipated! by manyr the fight grow-
, Ing, out of tho recent Democratic di
rect primary election on Maui appears
to be growing mere bitter daily, with
new developments .constantly being
' reported. - . .. - .
An appeal from the decision of the
Maul county committee, giving the
- election on that Island to 'Dr. J. H.
Raymond, who was ft candidate for
delegate to the national convention In
St Louis, has been taken to central
comnfttee by Attorn est-Eugere MUr-
phy of Vtiluku. defeated ciididate
for alternate to the delegate. ,.-
t This, movement on the. part; of At
torney Uurphy li-ings the entire bur-
- den of decision to the shoulders of
".the central - committee and, as it Is
controlled largely by the McCandless-
Vi:sott faction, it is difficult to de-
,k ; ternice Just which way the wind will
' blow after that body has sat on the
. appeal. ; ' ' . ,s .
Proxy Vote Included.
The Maui . county committee, in
awarding' the election, to Raymond,
holds that the 35 votes cast by proxy
in the liana district are valid,, and it
.is largely against this point of the de
"cision that Murphy has noted his ap-
peat Murphy claims that he has at-
' fidavita from the Hana judges o? elec
tion which show that they do not deny
that there were votes cast by proxy.
It was stated at Democratic head
quarters in Pauahi street today that
- the voters did not only cast their bal-
; lota for the absent party members.
but that the Raymond leaders could
not trust their own men, so took the
proxies from those' w ho were present
, at the polls and voted for them..;
' Committee- Meets Soon. ..
Tbe .central committee' probably
win meet within a few days to hear
Murphy's protest and it is also likely
that the demand of High Sheriff W. P.
vJarfett, who claims that the.certift
cate of election as national committee
man be given hinvwill be given con
