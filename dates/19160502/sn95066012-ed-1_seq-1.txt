Opening Session of Quadrennial
at Saratoga
DELEGATES SPf AK 23 TONGUES
Every Quarter of the Globe Where
Church Has Conferences, Save
Germany, Represented.
Saratoga Springs. May 1. Organic 5
Union ot all Methodists in the United ;
States, considered, by 6,300,000., com-.,
munieants, North and South, the most
vital problem confronting the church,
was among the first subjects introduc
ed at the opening session here today
of the twenty-seventh delegated quad- .
rennial gathering of the General Con
ference of the Methodist "Episcopal I
church.
Delegates speaking twenty-three-languages
and dialects, gathered from
every part of the globo save Germany
where the church has conferences, at
tended the opening ceremonies, and
will assist in deciding the question.
Their action, while not binding upon,
the Methodist Episcopal church, South,
will determine to a large extent what
hope there is of healihg the ancient
schism that divided the church on the
rock of slavery seventy-one years ago.
It can be stated on the highest au
thority that the commission on Federa
tion and Union, which will probably re
imrt to the conference on Wednesday,
will recommend national unification,
but no one, not even the best informed
ot the churchmen here, can pwedict
what will be done with the report after
it is submitted. While there is un
questionably strong eentiment among
the delegates for unity much depends
on the plan proposed, and the disposi
tion under it of the negro conferences.
The Methodist Episcopal church,
South, already has gone on record
favoring union.
