RIKER TRUCK IS
REVOLUTIONARY
MOTOR DEVICE
What is probably the first instance J
of automobile trucks doing service on
railroad lines was recorded Sunday
when a motor truck invented by A. I.
Biker of this city and made at the
plant of the 'Locomobile . Co. here sur
prised Generals , Scott and Punston by
its efficiency in their chase of Villa. :
' From Columbus;, N-. M., to El Paso,
Tex., 5 miles, the truck ran. over the
rails of the El Paso &. Southwestern
system. N Twenty- soldiers of the Twen
tieth " infantry, a machine gun and
equipment wereon board., An average
speed of 18 miles an hour was main
tained. 1 x- '
On- arrival at EI Paso the truck, car
rying ( its armed escort,' was driven off
the .rails' and over the road to Gen.
Scott's h0tel, where the army officers
made a careful inspection jot it.- k They
and- the engineers declared the ' test
most satisfactory. . .
The truck left El Paso 'the same day
and traveled, without incident, to: Co
lumbus. - - i-.
The trucks will b used by the XT. S.
army in Mexico, below Gasas Grandes,
where Gen. Pershing controls the rail
road." " .- --, -
They Jiave been equipped with
flanged steel " rims, fitted,, ..over the
wheels, which take the 'rails7 the same
as p. -locomotive wheel.:- The advantage
of thesje flanged . rims . is that they can
be carried on the truck while on reg
ular road service- and when desirable
to run the truck "over the railway lines
they can be lotted over the tires of the
truck wheels, Inless than an hour.and
the truck is ready to take the rails un-
Mer its own. power. The device was
invented ana developed by A.- Ia Hi
ker, vw?e president-and chief engineer
of the XiocomobileCok'of America..
Where' the roads, are unfavorable, or
are not the shortest distance, between
two points, it may"te, necessary, in an
emergency, . to transport : suimlies, and
materials of all sorts, by motor truck
over 'the railroad. This is .particularly
true of the present situation in Mex
t. . where the roads are almost lost in
the desert sand. " 2
The inability of the tr. S. forces to
use the . -railroads, ifvlth regular loco
motive ' equipment and rolling stock,
in Mexico, has caused 'untold, hard
ship and' deprivation, on the part of
the , American forces at present en
gaged' in the punitive . expedition at
Mexico. " ' .
This latest achievement of A. Li-' Pi
ker, opens up a new and important
field of endeavor :. for the gas motor
truck. Mr. Piker' is chairman of the
committees on internal combustion mo
tors of the TJ. S. Naval Advisory

LOVE REJECTED,
HE KILLS PRETTY
GIRL AND FAHTER
Thompson, Conn., May 2. George -A.
Pettis, a well-to-do farmer about 56
years old, and his daughter, Sybil, a
school teacher, aged 23, were shot and
billed at theft- home here today by
John Elliott, a man of about 45, who
is said to have been infatuated with
Miss Pettis. Elliott escaped and is
being sought by a posse of about 50
men who are scoruing the woods to
the eastward to the Rhode Island line,
in wbfch direction Elliott is believed
to have gone. s
Elliott, armed with two revolvers,
appeared at the Pettis home today
and while the farmer slept outside the
kitchen door, opened fe on him. El
liott, it was said, had 'previously cut
the telephone wires to prevent ' a call
for help, being sent out.
Pettis dashed back into the house,
Elliott firing several shots after him,
through the kitchen door, and through
a window. Pettis rushed upstairs to
get his rie but was dissuaded by Mrs.,
Pettis. Elliott had followed him into
the house, still firing . after him and
fatally wounding him.
As the shooting was going on, Miss
Pettis came from her room into the.
hallway and, was wounded in the ab
domen. She ran into her room crying,
"John shot me, I am dying," and a
few minutes later died. Her father,
who had gone to her assistance, was
found dead beside her. - ,
, Mrs; Pettis confronted Elliott as he
stood with smoking revolvers, and
asked him not to shoot her as she
wished to -bury the others already
aeaa. jsiliott, according to Mrs. Pettis,
told her she had "nerve," and added
that he did not mean to shoot the girl
and then disappeared.
Outside the house was found a. trav
eling bag containing two revolvers.
two large dirk knives.; a pair of brass
knuckles and two sticks of dynamite'
The country -eastward is thickly
woooea and it is believed Elliott took
that course in the hope of finding a
hiding place. An alarm was sent out
by . telephone through the whole dis
trict and the posse was so organized
and in pursuit of him.-
Elliott was employed at 'a horse shed
near . the trolley station ' here where
people driving In from - the outlying
districts are accustomed to leave their
horses when taking the trolley line.
Miss Pettis had been in the habit of
leaving her horse there when on her
way to her school a North Grosvenor-
dale and Elliott who, it is said, had
given indications of degeneracy, had
attempted to pay her attentions bu
had been repulsed. He is said to have
been drinking heavily last night.
