ffF MARRIED LIFE
Over Mr. and Mrs. Olaf Angstrom of Strat­
ford Celebrate Anniversary
April 28th.
Mr. and. Mrs. Olaf Angstrom of
Stratford quietly celebrated their
sixtieth wedding anniversary at
their home. On account of the scat
tered family and the advanced age
of the bride and groom—80 and 85
years—no elaborate preparations for
the event were made, but the aged
pair were well remembered by their
children.
Mr. and Mrs. Angstrom were mar
ried in Halsingland, in northern
Sweden, and came to America 49
years ago, 48 yearB ot that time hav
ing been spent in Hamilton county,
in the vicinity of Stratford. Eleven
children were born to the couple,
nine of whom are still living. There
are also 24 grandchildren and 14
great-grandchildren in the list of
descendants. Forty-seven living
descendants is a considerable contri
bution to the fibre of Americanism,
especially when the men and women
are a credit to their ancestry, as they
all are in this case.
The children are O. P.. P. T., and
Mrs! C. A. Rodine of Stratford Mrs.
J. R. Cottington «f Ayrshire Mrs.
M. Currey of Dallas, S. D. Albert
Angstrom of Staples, Minn. John1
Angstrom of Wilbur, Wash. Mrs. J.
H. Hice and .Mrs. A. H. Greeley both
of this city.
Mr. and Mro. Angstrom live alone
and keep house'in Stratford and are
in fairly good health. They are one
of the two or three Hamilton county
couples who have spent sixty wed
e) years together. Ten years ago on
the golden anniversary, the children
were all at home and the occasion
was elaborately celebrated.
James Traver has just purchased a
new Buick-six touring car.

Men Demanding an Increase in

the Advance is Granted.
MORE THAN 400 MEN IDLE.
The National Sewer Pipe Company
of This City Will Close for
Short Time.
From Saturday's Daily:
None of the four clay products
plants in Lehigh are running today
and better than 400 men are idle.
Only firemen to keep steam In the
boilers and men to finish burning
th^ wares already in the kilns are
on the job at present.
M. P. Chumlea, manager of the
Lehigh Sewer pipe and Tile Com
pany, asked the strikers for twenty
five men to load out the products
awaiting shipment. The men were
refused by the strikers and Mr.
Chumlea is reported to have said
that he would get someone to do the
work.
Twenty-two men working in. the
clay pits for the National Sewer
Pipe Company of this city and the
Plymouth Clay Products Company of
Fort Dodge, walked out Thursday
night., It was said at the Plymouth
office today that steam, shovels prob
ably would replace much of the hand
labor In the future.
The majority of the strikers are
foreigners, said to be Italians, They
held a meeting Thursday night in
Lehigh, at which they are presum
ed to have decided on a united front
for the three cents an hour increase
demanded.
The foreign element jtmong the
strikers is said to be well provided
with funds so that they can quit
woVk for six -months or more.
The attitude of the companies ev
idently is to stand pat in refusing
to pay the increase demanded. The
increase amounts to thirty cents a
day per man. or $2.50 instead of
$2.20.
Whether the owners of the plants
plan to import strike breakers, could
not be iearned. If men are import
ed, one authority in Lehigh declared
trouble may be expected.
P. W. Hearn, of the National com
pany, says the factory in this city
will probably close down for a short
time. Some repairs are necessary
and the company has a large stock
of wares on hand.

DRAWHIG CROWD
Mrs. Lizzie Middleton Delivers In'
teresting Address at Congre­
gational Church.
The union meeting held Sunday
evening in^ the Congregational
church under the auspices of the
Women's Christian Temperance
Union, was addressed by Mrs. Lizzie
Middleton of Kansas City, Mo. An
unusually large crowd was present
Mrs. J. C. Robison, president of the
local W. C. T. U., presided and in
troduced the speaker of the evening.
Rev. Shook of Peoria, 111., a visitin'g
pastor to the Universalist church, of
fered prayer in behalf of the great
work of the organization. The song
service was in charge of the regular
church choir.
Mrs. Middleton is a fluent speaker
and her talk was wholly along edu
cational lines. Her work in the
state is to reach the teachers in our
public schools and any spare time
she may have she devotes to the
boys and girls in the school room.
Should an opportunity .present It
self she also talks to the/men and
women.
She urges the need of education
In temperance. She declares that
many people are under a misappre
hension of the food value of beer
and light wines—for instance, beer
is often spoken of as the poor man's
bread becausp of its supposed food
value. An analysis discloses the food
properties of barrel of beer to be
only 2 per cent, and the correspond
ing food value of a barrel of flour is.
per cent. She also spoke, at
length upon the structure of the
brain and the effect of aicojtol upQit
"'The fate of many children of
parents addicted tp the use of nara
eotics, even uato the third and
fourth generations, was dwelt uppn.
The menace of the serving of light
wines or beer as a social custom in
the homes of many respected, church
going citizens, was also mentioned.
Mrs. Middleton as she herself
says, is wholly a temperance speaik
er, but she firmly believes that uni
versal suffrage will forward the
work of the temperance unioil and
make for more temperate, purer and
better living Conditions \generally,
hence better* men and women.
She emphasized the possibility of
Iowa's losing her prohibitory laws
the coming election this fall and
she declared that should women be
given the franchise the Christian
Temperance Union members of the
state would alone furnish ten thous
and votes for continued prohibition.
The collection taken up will go to
the state W. C. T. V- and be used to
further the cause of temperance ed
ucation in this state.
Some of the neighbors down in
the southeast part of the city are
keeping up in the clean-Up and
paint-up campaign. The residences
