! Note Is Delivered a
STATEMENT IS THE NOTE
WILL CLEAR SITUATION
(General Belief Is Kaiser Has
Agreed To Change Mode of
Submarine Warfare
By Cart W. Ackerman.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Berlin, May 2. The German reply
to the American submarine demands
viii completed today. A few alterations
were made in its text, but ttiere were
iiu changes in its character, which was
decided upon several days asjo. It is
thought thnt the message will be cabled
to Washington tonight or tomorrow.
The Aniericna embassy received from
Washington yesterday a message ex
plaining the interpretation placed by
the I'nited States on several points of
international law involved in the note.
This message was telegraphed to Am
bassador tlerard, who was in conference
with the kaiser.
The American embassy was informed
that Gerard would arrive here this aft
ernoon. He will came Washington n
long report on his conference with the
wmperor immediately upon his arrival.
Whether this will contain u private mes
wage to President Wilson from the
kaiser is not known.
Officials prefer that the newspaper
correspondents cable nothing indicative
of the chnrncter of Germany's reply un
til the oifieinl communication is re
ceived in Washington. It was stated,
however, that nothing has occurred ma
terially to change the situation since
Wednf sdav.
Feeling Is Optimistic.

innton is today awaiting the kaiser's
reply to the American submarine de
mands. As n result of Ambassador Ger
ard's delay in returning to Berlin from
the emperor's field headquarters, the
dispatch expected from tne American
envoy yesterday was not looked for un
til tomorrow morning.
In the meantime, there. is no official
light on Germany's proposed action. Un
official dispatches from Berlin said the
necond draft of the replv was complet
ed. By all accounts the note should
be en route to Washington tonight or
tomorrow.
The fact that the conference between
Gerard and the kaiser was more pro
longed than nt first planned was taken
taken ns a hopeful indication.
United Tress dispatches from Berlin
todny renewed the optimism which was
also felt in administration circles. The
general belief was that Germany would
yield and promise to cense its "present
method of submarine warfare." lot
whether this would ear up .VI rtiffi
unities immediately, or whether the re
ply would concede the pr.'si.leiw's de

of the permanency of its acipiiefc?nce,

Tittsburg, Fa., May 2. One hund.ed
speciul police from the Carnegie com
pany were brought to the Pittsburg i'is
trjet today to guard the Kdgar lhomp
son steel plant at Braddock. and other
establishments where stiikes are thrubt
ened. Four hundred mo;i special of

The Paddock plant is operating with
a reduced force. The number of strik
ers there is estimated at fn.ru I ,ooo to
5,000. Resumption of ri'itiujr by Wot
inghouse workers and tneir allied strik
ers is momentarily expected.
Five hundred employes of the Pressed
Steel Car company joiued the strike to
day. Leaders claiai a thousand enlist
ments to the striken ranks. Forty-five
thousand, including 4.000 muchinis'j.
who struck yesterday, are said to be

Wharves Filled With Freight
Now York, May 2 Thousands of tons
of freight are piling up. on the wharves
today with only slight possibility of
their being moved until an agreement
has been reached with the striking tug
boat hands and barge men. Terminals
of the railroads are choked with freight.
Freight vessels hnve delayed sailing
en account of lack of tugs. Much of
their freight is war munitions for the
allies. Other vessels carry cargoes of
perishable goods.
No Tugs for Big Liners.
New York, May 2. Orders calling
out every garment worker in the inde
pendent shops as well as in those es
tablishments which are members of the
Manufacturers' association, threatened
a complete tieup of the clothing trade
today.
President Schlessinger said that hun
dreds of non-union tailors would join in
an individual, sympathetic strike. The
longshoresmen 's strike is spreading, and
shipping is greatly affected.
Strikes of stevedores, marine engii
eers, firemen, cooks, deckhands, ware
housemen, and tugmen's union have re
sulted in the tieup of 050 harbor tugs, it
is claimed. There is a possibility that
lack of tugs will hamper the entrat.co of
four trans-Atlantic liners tomorrow

New York, May 2. Mr. American
laboring man is starting the month of

Example of Switzerland'

By WUliam O. Shepherd.
f United Press staff correspondent.)
Berne, May 2. The men of Switzer
land aren't soldiers, in pence times.
They are only citizens who know how
to be soldiers if they have to.
The United States doesn't need
4,000,000 soldiers. What it does need
is 4,000,000 men who know how to be
soldiers, ia case the need arises.
"I had a boy in college," wrote the
father of a young British soldier, "fine
day he ran off and enlisted In a London
foot regiment. After three months'
training his regiment was sent to Fland
ers. He was killed at Ypres. I am
telling you this to help you preach the
gospel of compulsory training, not con
scription. "I am grieved and proud about my
boy. But I feel that this regiment
did not have a sporting chance. They
only knew how to go ou and die. I feel
that the men in England who oppose
compulsory military training are guilty
of a greater felony thna those who sank
the I.usitania."
This is the sort of feeling I find, this
feeling expressed by this father, that
brought about compulsory military
training in Switzerland.

Dublin. May 2. At least 500 rebels
were killed and 1,500 wounded in the
seven flnys of street fighting here, it
was estimated todny by soldiers who
canvassed the city.
Rebel bodies were found in ruins of
the postoffice,' Liberty hall and other
buildings demolished by artillery. The
casualties are far in excess of early
estimates. Many corpses are believed
still undiscovered. Hospitals are over
flowing with wounded, including women
and children.
Lord Donoughmoro, former British
commander in Egypt and at one time a
member of the cabinet, was shot while
motoring north of Dublin. He suffered
a slight flesh wound.
A smnll squad of rebels determined to
die hard fired the last volley of tho in
surrection last night near the Westland
station. The whole party wnB wiped out
by machine guns.
Probnblv the final shot of the rebel
lion was fired by a sniper concealed in
a tower of the gas works. He sent
three bullets toward a party of news
paper correspondents boarding a tug in
the I.iffey.
The city Is resuming its normal life.
Shops are reopening.
To Try Casement First
London, May 2. All rebels who bore
arms in t(ie Dublin revolt will be
brought to England for trial, it was an
nounced today. Suspects and .Sinn Fein
sympathizers who did not openly take
up arms against the government will be
tried in the Irish courts.
Several hundred prisoners have al
ready reached England. They arc liable
to trial by court martial, and may bo
executed if convicted. The trains will
probably be postponed until the govern
ment disposes of the case of Sir Roger
Casement, whom the Germans sent to
head the Irish rebellion. He is a prison
er in the Tower of Loudon.
Greatest interest b displayed with
her force of 100 of Countess Markie
vicz, who surrendered with her force of
100 rebels.
Troops brought in about 50 insurg"7its
from the suburbs of DibMi and from
small cities during the uiiit, but no
fresh disturbances were reported. 1 ah
orers are at work razing walls of
buildings wrecked during the fighting.
Party Attacks Police,
Drogheda, Ireland, May 2. A pnrty
of rebels attacked tho police of Gar
ristown, 10 miles from Dublin early
today, wounding four. Eight rehels were
captured. The rest escaped. Slight dis
turbances occurred in tho suburbs of
Dublin nnd tho outlying districts.
ican mind that compulsory military
training isn't intended to create sol
diers. Its purpose is to create a nntiou
of fine, strong young men and hale,
hearty old men who will know how to
be soldiers if an enemy forces them to
play that role.
The Swiss aren't fussy; they don't
love fighting. All these yenrs of horn
ing how to be soldiers, if the need
comes, has taught them that fighting is
no picnic and that it doesn't pay to
start a row just for the sako of rowing.
The Swiss are not a fighting nation,
like the Serbs, for instance and yet, man
for man, the Swiss army is the equal of
any army in the world. Every citizen
in the ever fighting Balkans is a sol
dier; a potential killer. That's one
of the troubles with the Balkans. But
every citizen of Switzerland, because
of his scientific training, is a citizen
who 11 be a soldier only when some
enemy drives him to play that role.
That's the big reason Switzerlnnci is
at peace today. ,
It would cause an uphcavel in the
United States to put the Swiss military
system into effeet there. In fact we
couldn't transplant It in its entirety.
There arc some things obout it, that
Americnns wouldn't like. One of them
is the little blue book. -

The Vote Will Decide Relative
Strength of Factions-'
Voting Is Very Light
San Francisco, May 2. A heavy vote
was not expected in San Francisco to
day in tho California presidential pref
erence primary, although the weather
was ideal. Polls opened at 6 a. m., nnd
will remain open until 7 p. ni.
The only contest was in the republi
can division. All the democratic dele
gates were pledged to support President
Wilson at the convention, and the pro
gressive delegates wi ie unp'elge.l.
Two tickets for delegates to the O. O.
P. convention were in the field. One
card was composed of "rogul.i.- repub
licans," selected at the republican state
convention. The opposition ticket of re
publican candidates, called the "united
republicans" favored an alliance with
the progressives in the support of a
"forward looking candidate," and had
the endorsement of Governor Johnson.
One-third Wui Vote.
Sacramento, Cal., May 2 Sacramento
couaty took little interest in tho presi
dential primary electfon today.
It was predicted thnt not more than
8.000 of the 22,000 registered electors
would vote.
What little interest there is in tho
election was stirred up by the tilt be
tween the United and Regular republi
cans. About 70 per cent of those who
voted asked for the republican ballot.
Although there were quite a number of
progressives registered in this count
tho progressive ballots were in small
demand.
Light Vote in South.
I.os Angeles, Cal., May 2. A light
vote with 90 per cent of the interest
among republican factions was the indi
cation todny in the southern California
presidential primuries.
With ideal weather the small turn
out of voters came as a surprise. Great
er interest was displayed in smaller sur
rounding cities than in Los Angeles.
All democrats were pledged to sup
port Wilson and the progressives were
unpledged.
A voto of 150,000 for all territory
south of the Tehachnpi, was predicted.
Oakland Voto Small.
. Oakland, Cal., May 2. Quiet and or
derly voting characterized tho early
hours at the polls here today. Though
Alameda county has been considered a

of Ships Urgent
Washington, May 2. "Uncle Sam,
manufacturer, is trying to take care of
more orders than he is physicially
equipped to fill."
Except for the foregoing condition,
commerce, foreign and domestic, is the
best it has been for years. Secretary
of Commerce licdfield today said in an
interview with tho United Press. Time
and on adequate merchant marine arc
tho only remedies necessary to niuke
commerce of the United States ascend
to di.zy heights in bulk and value of
shipping.
That the European war proved a big
incentive to foreign commerce of the
United States is shown in statistics
given by the secretary. At the same
time tho relative importance of ship
ments of strictly war articles has been
generally exaggerated, he said.
"A great many persons believe the
munitions shipments form the bulk of
our foreign trade," Redfield said.
"While it is true that our trado in
arms, supplies and articles used by
armies of tho bnlligercnt powers is
very great, yet the proportion which
such exports bear to all exports is not
so relatively lurge as is generally be
lieved." Japanese Village

American Troops In Stress
Position and Ready to Act
On Moments Notice
By E. T. Conkle.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
El Paso, Texns, May 2. What wera
regarded as final instructions for the
American repricntutives ia the con
ference with General Alvaro Obregon,
Mexican war minister, arrived from
Washington today and General Hugh
Scott stated that a second meeting;
would take p'ace this afternoon. The
timo and place will probably be left
to the convenience ot the Mexican mem
bcrs.
The instructions which the Americans
are to follow conform to the outlines
givon in Washington dispatches aud
confirm statements that the conference
will have no power to decide future
movements of American troops in Mex
ico and that there will be no immediate
withdrawal of the United States expedi
tion. Will Not tacusa It.
At the next session, Scott will ad
vise Obregon that Washington rcfuse.i
to consent to discuss at this conference!
the question of immediate withdrawal.
Ohreinn is exoected ootitclv to decline
to discuss any other question until t
proposition of having tho American
forces leave his country is settled, in
which ease tho confe.eiice can only ad
journ in deadlock.
Obregon, in a statement to the United
Press yesterday, said that, in such nn
event, ho would report the whole sit
uation to President Carrnnza.
This was taken to Indicnte that fail
ure of tho conference would be fol
lowed by further diplomatic exchanges)
rather than by military operations. A
break is considered unlikely.
The date of the American expedi
tion's final withdrawal and details of
rio-opcrution Iwith Carranzista troops
whilo hunting Francisco Villa in Mex
ico are expected to bo fixed by nego
tiations between Secretary Lansing and
Mexican Ambassador Arrcndondo in
Washington.
They Want Intervention.
Interventionists are still busy alonu
the border, especially in t, Paso, trying
to bring about a situation that will
muko intervention inevitable. The gen
eral belief here is that they will fail,
unless some hothead among tho Amer
ican or Mexican forces permits a clash,
to occur, which might be so serious as
to render pence impossible.
In tho meantime, both the Mexican
and American armies aro inactive. At
some poinU along the line taken by tho
American expedition the forces are only
a few miles apart. No alarm i-s felt
for General Pershing's command as it
has been heavily reinforced, strongly
cnuinDcd nnd provisioned to meet any
situation which may arise. There are
now 17.000 Americans in Mexico, all ex
cept about 200 along tho line from thn
border to Wnmiquinn, proiecteu ny en
trenched and fortified camps. General
Funston is confident thnt the Amer
icans could hold out indefinitely against
much lamer forces of Mexicans, and
could take the offensive if it were de
sirable. Troops Ready for Action.
