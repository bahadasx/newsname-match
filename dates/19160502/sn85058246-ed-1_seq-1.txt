L BURLEY HAS
f RETIRED AS
R. R. CHIEF
v, D. 8. 8pner It Promoted by the
7 Oregon Short Line to
Mt Succeed Him
dT1. Burloy, one of the moit pop
ular and widely known passenger
traffic officials west of the Missouri
river, retired from active service as
general passenger agent of the Ore
gon Short Line yesterday. Daniel 3.
Spencer, assistant general passenger
agent, equally as popular and almost
as widely known, was elovated to
the position mado vacant by the re
tirement of Mr. Burloy.
Mr. Spencer was succeeded as as
sistant general passenger agent by
J. B. Durham, chief clerk in the pas
senger department of the company.
Mr. Durham's successor probably
will be named within the next day
or two.
For several months past there has
been a 'rumor to. the effect that 1Ir
Hurley expected to rotlro from, active
service this summer, but the olUclal
announcement of his retlrement.came
ns n surprise when made yesterday
by E. E. Calvin, vice president and
general manager of tho company.. In
fact, Mr Calvin expressed almost an
much surpriso as any one. Inasmuch
as Mr. Bailey's request that his re
tlrement become effective May 1 was
made during the past fow days.
Gratifying to Many
In all the talk of Mr. Burlcy's re
tirement there has been but one man
mentioned as his successor. Tho pro
motion of Mr. Spencer was taken as
a foregone conclusion In tho event
of Mr. Burlcy's retirement. His
elevation to the responsible position
at the head of the passenger traffic
1 department of tho big railroad does
pCjRP not come us a surprise, other than
of its suddenness, but is none the
less gratifying to his host of friends
in all walks of llfo throughout the in
termountaln country.
Thoro was considerable speculation
as to who might succeed Mr. Spen
cer as assistant general passenger
agent. Thero wcro so many men
connected with tho department who
were In every way qualified for tlio
liosttlon that It seemed Impossible
to select the most likely candidate
Mr. Durham Is e-ldtln point of ser
vice with tho company and has mado
his mark whllo at tho head of the
rates and division bureau. As a rato
expert he haB gained far more than
a local reputation and the ranking
officials deemed it only fit that his
ability, loyalty and length of service
be given recognition through tho
medium of a promotion.
Tho fact that tho company saw fit
to recognize men who have served it
long and faithfully, local men, as it
were, Is a source of gratifications,
not only to tho men themselves, but
to their friends throughout the west
and to the other employes of the,
road. However, this policy Is not ex
actly now to the Oregon Short Lino;
It has been followed to a great ox
tent during recont years.
. Mr. Spencer started his railroad
career at tho very foot of tho lad
der.. When scarcely moro than u
schoolboy ho became a messenger in
tho telegraph department of tho old
Utah Central. That was back in
1874. Ho was steadily and rapidly
ndvancod to moro Important positions
serving as telegrapher, ticket agent,
train dispatcher, trainmaster and
other posts in tho operating depart
ment. Then ho bocamo Identified
with traffic department and attained
Itlio position of chief clerk to tlio gen
cral passenger and ticket agont, tho
position ho occupied when Mr. Bur.
ley becamo tho head of tho passenger
traffic department. In recognition of
i Ms services and to fill a long felt
RjVV "it, Mr, Spencer was clovntpd to
H tho position of assistant eeneral P&s
I H sengor agent, March 1, 1901". "Ho U
H a naUvo of Salt Lako.
H Mr. Durham halls from Illinois,
tut so long ago that ho has almost
B forgotten It. He was born at La
Salle, Illinois, but when fifteen years
oi ago entered tho servlco of the.
Union Pacific at. Omaha !i tho capac,.
M Uy of mossongor boy. ' Thnt was in
1S83, Ho was promoted to various
positions In tho department and came

In which ho takes tho leading part
