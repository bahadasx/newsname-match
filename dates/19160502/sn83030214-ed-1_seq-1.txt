NO MAN CAN TAMPER WITH HONOR
OR INTFXRITY OF U. S., SAYS WILSON
'God forhid that we should be drawn into war! But if we should
be Ameriea would seem oncc more to shakc herself out of a drea*n
to say, 'Did any man deem that wc were asleep' Did any man deem
that we had forgotten the traditions of Ameriea? Did any man deem
tli.it he eottld tamper with the honor or integrity of the Un'ted State?.?'
and in the great voice of national enthusiasm whieh would be raised
all the world would stand once more thrilled to hear the voice of the
new work! asserting the standards of justice and of liberty.
"I havc never had the slightest doubt of what would happen when
Ameriea callcd upon thosc of ber dti/ens bom in other countnes to
come tO the support of the flag. Why, they will come with cheers.
they will come with a momentum whieh will make us rcalize that
Ameriea has oncc more been cricd awake out of every sort of dis
temper and drcam and distraction, and that any man who dares tamper
with thc spirit of Ameriea will be rast out of thc confidcnce of a grcit
nation upon the instant."
