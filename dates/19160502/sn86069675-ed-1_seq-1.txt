Dr. Edward 0. Gucrrant, One of
Kentucky's Most Beloved Sons,
Died Suddenly.
Friends nnd admirers all over
Kentucky were grieved to learn that
Dr. Edward O. Gucrrant, soldier,
physician, minister and philanthro
pist had died suddenly nt Douglas,
Ga., Wednesday while on his way
home to Kentucky from Florida
where ho had spent the winter.
Dr. Gucrrant was born in Bath
county seventy-eight years ago. Ho
was a young man when tho war
broko out between tho North and
South and ho enlisted as a privato
in a home regiment, commanded al
ternately by Humphroy Marshall,
"Ccrro Gordo Williams" and Gilter
Cosby. For conspicious bravery ho
was promoted several times, finally
attaining the rank of Adjutant Gen
eral. At the conclusion of hostili
ties he went to Wilmoro to live.
In 18G5, with "nothing but ono
gray jacket," as ho said, he went
to Philadelphia and from there to
New York to continue tho study of
medicine. lie studied hnrd and
enmc back home and soon won a
thriving practice. Ho purchased
Bclvoir in 1880 after being or
dained as a minister.
Dr. Guerrnnt was the idol of the
people of the mountains, because,
he fought with them in the Southern
ranks. Realizing thnt the residents
of the mountains hnd little, if any,
opportunity to be enlightened on
the doctrine" o Christianity, ho
worked hard to teach them. In his
new relationship with the residents,
he established many schools in
Eastern Kentucky, particularly in
Estill, Letcher, Powell, Breathitt
and Perry counties. He was direct
ly interested in these schools until
ill health forced him to rest.
Everybody in Wilmorc and the
surrounding countryside referred tc
the town as "Guerrantvillc." Dr.
Guerrnnt maintained his office nt
Wilmoro and despite his- advanced
ago pursued his work with remark
able vigor. His drawing room and
office at Wilmoro nro littered with
relics of tho war and manuscripts
and pictures of famous authors.
IIo rose each morning nt 4, began
work immediately nnd breakfasted
with his family at G. At 9 p. m. ho
retired. IIo refused to alter theso
hours until his health began to fail.
Dr. Gucrrant knew intimately
many hundreds of Kentuckinns in
widely separated counties as well
as his native ono. IIo established
a winter home in Lake county.
Florida, whero each winter, ho
went to live. Ho made n fortune
during his lifetimo and out of his
own personal fund had aided
churches, schools and institutions.
IIo lived in this city for many
years and was grently beloved by
all who knew him.

an annual affair which has grown
in popularity since its institution in

ling will extchd special invitations
to young nnd old, who arc not reg
ular attendants nt tho Sundny
School sessions, to nttend in order
to keep in touch with tho growth
and development of Sunday School
work.
On the first observance of the
day, the attendance in the State
was doubled, being increased from
300,000 to 000,000. Last year the
mark was set1 at a million and so
complete was the organization of
the workers in the cities nnd towns
that the number was reached, and
a new nnd vigorous interest in Run-
day ( School work was developed
which promises to make May- 7th
of this year one of tho greatest
days that tho Kentucky Sunday
Schools have ever seen.
The Kentucky Sundny School
(Association has prepared a special
program for the guidance of Sun
day School leaders and copies will
bo sent free to schools desiring
them.
As a result of the "Go-To-Sun-lay-Schpol"
movement .fifty thous
and permanent additional students
were enrolled last year, and the ob
servntion ot the any lias had a
stimulating effect in awakening in
terest in active church and Sunday
School work among church mem
bers who had been comparatively
indifferent.
"To secure one million people in
the Sunday Schools of Kentucky on
Mny 7th will mean thnt every mem
ber of the Sunday Schools must be
present -that day and bring some
body else. If you n tended li"t year

provements. You will be sure of a
cordial welcome."
