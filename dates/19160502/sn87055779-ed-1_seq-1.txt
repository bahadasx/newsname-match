FRENCH GAPTUR
TEUTON TRENCHES
Occupy 500 Yards of Fortifi

Intern;ition;il New Service:
PA PIS. May 2. The war office
announced today that in an attack
against the r;-rmans north of I)ou-
autnont. on the east bank of the
Meuse river. lYench troops had oc
cupied 500 yards of the enemy's
trenches Hrd taken 1 e? o prisoners.
This gain on Verdun's northeast
front is the largest made in any of
the recent French counter-attac ks.
In the offensive operations that
the French launched on the west
bank on the night of April 2: they
succeeded in gaining a total of 1.000
yards of the cierman trenches in the
vicinity of Dead Man's hill.
The voik of three davs has thus
netted the French more than a mile
of F.erman trenches. The initiativ
appears to ha pasM into the
hands of the defenders of Verdun,
the Hermans being checked in every
'ffort to press forward.
The ollicial rnmmunbpie reports
a t ontinuntion of artillery activity
about Dead Man's hill and Ovocourt.
If the Hermans abandon their efforts
to take Verdun they probably will
continue their bombardment for
many days.

in South Pend, following the wide
publicity given thiough The News
Times and through the Civic Center
clubs to present deplorable condi
tions, it is probable that the move
ment for better housing will be
pushed to a crux during Clean-Up
week.
At an enthusiastic and largely at
tended meeting of the Heneral Fed
eration of Civic clubs Monday even
ing at the high school, the federa
tion went on record emphatically as
endorsing the movement for better
housing to begin immediately with a
sanitary Or housing survey of the
city. This survey will be possible
as soon as the board of health is
given a special otlicer to be dele
gated to this duty, and the l 'e dera
tion of Civic clubs unanimously
passed a second resolution that each
civic club send a delegation of two
cr more members to the city council
to ask that this special ollicer he ap
pointed. rut or Permanent CIcan-Tp.
In the opinion of those most inter
ested in the movement, and they in
clude the mayor and the secretary

both feasible and desirable for

Action in favor of the better hous

with the effect of poor housing
conditions on the health and morals
of the community, and a means for
remedying existing conditions, was
