CLEAN," SAYS M'BRIDE
Sporting Editor of the Kansas
City Star Tells of
Experiences.
CARTOONIST IN TALK
William Hanny of St. Joseph
News-Press Explains
Pen Stories.
"I'nlversity of Missouri sportsman
ship is of the highest grade I have
found in any of the universities and
colleges I have isited as an official
and reporter, and the people of Co
luuihia are ahove the average in hos
pitality toward visitors. There's
something about the place that makes
folks want to come back."
C. E. McBrido, sporting editor of
the Kansas City Star, paid this trib
ute to the University and Columbia
in his talk on "The Sport Page," at
the morning Journalism Week ses
sion in Switzlcr Hall. He told of his
experiences as reporter and sporting
editor.
"The policy of the Star's sporting
department has been criticised a
great deal by professional promoters
because we give so much space to
amateur sports. Well, we do devote
space to amateurs and will continue
to do so as long as our readers con
tinue to like it. And that is what the
sporting editor has to do: find out
what the people want and give it to
them in a fair-minded, above-bribe
way. We don't head our page with
flaring banners, but wo give the
news."
St. Joseph Cartoonist Talks.
William Hanny, cartoonist for the
St. Joseph News-Press, spoke on
"The Nature of the Cartoon."
"Some people, chiefly the higher
art critics, say that there's nothing to
the cartoon and that it is passing
away," said Mr. Hanny. "Hut if this
is so the publishers of the newspa
pers have not yet found it out. At
any rate they are giving more and
more attention every year to the car
toon as an entertaining and instruct
ing feature of their journals.
"The field for the cartoonist with
ideas and ideals is growing all the
time. There's scarcely a daily paper
in the country that does not use car
toons provided by a man on the staff
or by a syndicate. The reason is that
editors know that the people read the
picture story of the news and like it.
Of course art critics are opposed to it
because it is too simple and lacking in
tone, color, atmosphere and similar
qualities that please their high-brow
tastes. Hut the man with a dinner
pall revels In it, for he can see the
idea at a glance."
Paper Situation Keeps Him Away.
K. II. I.illey. general manager of the
St. Louis Republic. who was to have
spoken on "The Making of a Metro
politan Journal," telegraphed from
Xew York that he couldn't be here,
having been compelled to go to Que
bec to investigate the white paper
scarcity. He may come later on in
the week.
II. W. Patton. a former Missourian
and now president of the Washington
State Press Association, sent the fol
lowing telegram: "Permit me in the
name of the Washington State Press
Association to extend hearty good
wishes for the complete success of
Journalism Week."
Trees Spelling Reform.
Or. A. Gideon, .newspaper represen
tative of the Simplified Spelling
Hoard, Xew York City, narrowed his
assigned subject, "The Xewspaper and
Spelling Heform," down to "The
Awakening of the Fourth Estate."
He designated the American press
as the fourth estate, and outlined the
methods by which the press could as
sist in the spelling reform, the pur
poso of which, he said, is to "make
spelling more regular and less waste
ful." "I.ct publishers and editors." he said,
"not imagine that the promoters of sim
plified spelling, in defiance of all tra
dition, advocate sweeping changes In
our spelling such as would destroy the
Identity of our language or add to the
burden of the proofreader of the com
posing room. In the words of the late
Professor Lounsbury. they desire
merely 'to wash the dirty face of our
orthography.' They wish neither to
live and bring up their children bur
dened by the age-long clutter of the
past, nor to renovate the orthographic
establishment so suddenly as to throw
the present generation off the ordi
nary course of living. They begin by
clearing the desk of trash, rather than
by raising a dust and dislodging the
entire household."
Some Impromptu Talks.
Dr. C. J. Hlackburn of Hlaekburn.
Mo., J. T. Kenower of Ureckenridge,
Mo., William Field of Xew Florence
and W. S. McClevey of St. Louis made
short talks.
Doctor Hlackburn alluded to the ab
sence of his whiskers and said that his
mother was tile inspiration which led
him to consent to their removal.
Mr. Kenower said that the Univer
sity of Missouri had done more for the
journalism of the state than any other
factor.
Mr. Field said he was such a believ
er in efficiency that his friends called
him .Mr. Efficiency.
.ur. .wcuievey told or t progress
made by the Western Newspaper
Union, which supplies G.000 news
papers with press matter and gives
them individual sen Ice.
Arthur F. Killick (Fatty Uwis) of
Kansas City talked on his idea of cul
ture. He said that people often pre
tended to be enthusiastic over and to
appreciate things, just because they
were the prevailing fads.
"I'm only giving three cheers for the
things I really like and the things I
know about," he so'd.

GIVES ADVICE TO WOMEN
Mrs
Mulchings Tells of Special Fields
Open fo Tlietu.
The afternoon program today was In
charge of the women journalists. Mrs.
Emily Grant Hutchings, special writer
for the St. Ixjuis Globe-Democrat,
spoke on "City Journalism for Wom
en." Mrs. Hutchlngs' three rules for the
worn n journalist were: adeijuate pre
paration for some special line of news
paper work, above all things to be
womanly, and to be a good woman.
"One great thing for women," said
Mrs. Hutchings, ' is to marry. Women
should not go into journalism as a per
manent career. Four or five years in
newspaper work is most broadeniiiR
and enlightening, biit a lifetime in a
newspaper office is narrowing. After a
woman has served her time as a jour
nalist she may go into publicity work,
join the syndicate writers or the space
writers."
Mrs. Hutchings named as fields for
women journalists: society or relig
ious editor, the children's page, beauty
editor, household department, feature
stories, art and musical criticisms and
personal interviews.

Columbia's bankers, in session yes
terday, agreed to cash warrants for
University salaries until June.
President A. Ross Hill, in com
menting on the action of the bankers
and the Hoard of Curators today, said:
"At a conference between Univer
sity curators and Columbia bankers
yesterday temporary arrangements
were made whereby each banker will
cash warrants of those professors and
employes who do business with his
particular bank. This arrangement,
however, will not last beyond com
mencement in June. The warrants
for April salaries were released to
day. It is the hope of the curators
that state finances will improve, or
that some arrangement with local
bankers can bo made, to last till the
next meeting of the Legislature.
"This situation is not due to the
failure of the last Legislature to ap
propriate enough money for the Uni
versity, though there was appropri
ated $25,000 less for maintenance
from the general revenue than for the
preceding biennial period and Gov
ernor Major had to hold up $25,000 of
the appropriation, making the net
amount $50,000 less. The University
is keeping its expenditures within the
appropriation and the governor's ex
ecutive order, but the requisitions for
the University's monthly share of the
general revenue are not honored by
he state auditor.
Expenditures Reduced.
"All other appropriations to the
University from the general revenue
fund are for agricultural extension
projects, including farm advisers, off
set to Smith-Lever congressional
grants, eta Hy executive order $30,
000 of the amount appropriated for
these items was held up and the ex
penditures for these projects have
been accordingly reduced by the Uni
versity, but no requisition for these
purposes filed since December, 1915,
has been honored.
"The requisitions signed by the cu
rators yesterday, chargeable to the
general revenues, amount to approxi
mately $27,000 for maintenance and
agricultural extension projects in ad
dition to the $83,227.51 already re
ported.
Constitution Ciled.
"State Auditor Gordon has cited the
constitution in justification of his ac
tion in paying practically all other
claims upon the state while declining
to draw warrants to honor the Uni
versity requisitions. The curators
yesterday instructed their attorney to
call .Mr. Gordon's attention to the fact
that a Supreme Court decision stands
squarely against his Interpretation.
The case is 1G0 .Missouri 190 State ex
rel vs. Henderson. The opinion was
written by Judge Gantt and on page
211 he says: 'In prescribing the or
der for the passage of the appropri
ation hills there was no intention to
create special liens upon the moneys
in the treasury- or give any priority of
payment to one appropriation over
another.'
"Yet it is stated and has not been
denied that Mr. Gordon is issuing
warrants for the payment for all
state officers and clerks at Jefferson
City and practically all the state In
stitutions while requisitions to the
amount of thousands of dollars on be
half of the University at Columbia re
main unhonorcd."
