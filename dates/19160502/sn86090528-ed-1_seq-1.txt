SAVE WIFE'S LIFE

Comanche, gave his wife over a quart
and a hait of his blood this morning
in an effort to save her life.
Mrs. Adcock had been ill for sev
eral years and when she was brought
to the Chickasha hospital a few days!
ago, it was found necessary to oper
ate. Becauso of her lack of blood the
physlciuns said she could not survive
the operation in her present condi

or friends would volunteer the trans

a robust man, promptly offered to un
dergo the ordeal.
