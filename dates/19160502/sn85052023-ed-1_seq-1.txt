FIRE FOUND
ON TWO ROOFS
Incipient Blazes Discovered at Homes
of G. B. Cooper and Warren
Hocker Just In Time
Detected in time, fires which
threatened the homes of County
Clerk George B. Cooper and Warren
Hocker, were extinguished in time
to prevent serious damage Saturday
and Monday. A blaze was discovered
in the roof of Mr. Cooper's home on
Portman avenue about 9 o'clock
Saturday morning. Mr. Cooper is
having a bathroom built on the sec
ond floor and the disarrangement of
the glectric wires during the con
struction work is thought to have
probably caused the blaze. The fire
alarm brought out neighbors and the
department, in a hurry and the blaze
was put out before it had gained
much headway.
No alarm was turned in when the
roof of Warren Hocker's cottage on
West Main street was discovered on
fire early Monday morning. Neigh
bors quickly went to the rescue and
a few buckets of water did the work
quickly here, also. A defective flue
is thought to have probably been the
cause of this incipient blaze. The
damage in each case will be only a
small amount.
Miss Jennie Hocker kindly sent
the I. J. the following concerning the
fire at her home. " 'Rose Cottage,
the attractive home of Miss Jennie
White Hocker, came near going up
in flames Monday morning, but by
the heroic management of her bro
ther, J. Warren Hocker, Mr. Welch
Rochester, Mr. Robert Bruce, and
other kind friends, it was soon ex
tinguished. Miss Jennie had at once
the best galvanized metal roof in
town put on her kitchenette, making
it fire proof." .
Members of the City Council have
asked the I. J. to request all who have
occasion to call for the fire depart
ment, to phone to Carter & Carter s
stable where the fire fighting ma
chinery is kept. Much time can be
saved by phoning to the stable di
rect rather than to neighboring
stores.

CARD FROM O. N. COOK
The I. J. has received the follow
ing from O. N. Cook, who has been
mentioned several times in the
Preachersville correspondence.
Nugent, Tex., May 1, 1916.
To whom it may concern: I want
to sav it has not been, nor is it my
purpose not to return every book
trusted me by the hospitable people
of Preachersville or any other sec
tion. It has been impossible for me to
return them before now. Sickness
and being forced to seek warmer cli
mate, being raised in the south, has
prevented me from making a delivery
so that I could return the borrowed
books. I have been doing my best to
get the books returned before now.
I am working night and day almost,
with the same company I was with
with while in that section. I will re
turn and deliver all books which I
borrowed also all those which I have
orders for, some time in May.
I certainly mean to do the right
thing. I am very sorry I have delay
ed the people, who have been anxiuos
to study the book, "Self Knowledge."
Those to whom I have not written
may refst assured that their books
will be delivered either by me in per
son or by insured mail, as soon as
possible. .
Very truly,
0. N. COOK.
Best Thing for a Bilious Attack
On account of my confinement in
the printing office I have for years
been a chronic sufferer from indiges
tion and liver trouble. A few weeks
ago I had an attack that was so se
vere that I was not able to go to the
case for two days. Failing to get any
relief from any other treatment, I
took three of Chamberlain's Tablets
and the next day I felt like a new
man," writes H. C. Bailey, Editor
Carolina News, Chapin, S. C. Ob
tainable everywhere.

LOCAL BOYS
STILL UNBEATEN
I Stanford High School Lads Win from
Richmond Normal and Outclass
Danville High Team.
The Stanford High School base ball
team's string of victories remains un
broken. Since last Friday, two more
triumphs have been chalked on the
right side. Saturday afternoon the
local nine went to Richmond and
stacked up against the speedy bunch
of ball tossers at the Eastern State
Normal. The game went 10 innings
but Stanford came through with the
victory in the 10th by a score of 10
to 9. Bill Reinhnrt, the 15-year-old
kid pitcher, the "find" of the season,
started the game, but the strong Nor
mals got to him for five runs in the
seebnd inning after which Capt.
Embry dorrickec: him and put Dozier
on the fring line. The teachers
found Dozier for four more tallies
during the extended sessions, but
Stanford cut the home team down
to its size by hard batting and errat
ic fielding by their opponents and
won it out in the tenth. Stanford
made 8 hits to 9 for Richmond, and
had six errors chalked up against
them to 10 for the pedagogues. The
score by innings was as follows:
Stanford 200030202 1 10

Burlesque Base Ball
Monday afternoon the Danville
High School nine came over and
were shown what a regular high
school nine looks like, Stanford de
feating the Boyle lads, 17 to 5. The
five scores the visitors accumulated
were practically gifts, at that. Af
ter the game had been safely placed
on ice in the first few innings, all
three of the regular outfielders and
several infielders were led to the sta
ble and a bunch of youngsters from
the Eighth grade team were given a
good workout. These boys didn't
do much baiting, with the exception
of "Tub" Martin, but they exhibit
ed a nice fielding game. Martin
proved himself of big league calibre
right off the reel, for he plaved a
star-game behind the bat the 'short
time he officiated there and he al
most, knocked the cover off the ball
the first time he came to bat. He
slammed out a bteautiful triple to
left but was called out by a lynx
eyed umpire who said he cut first
base on his way around. "Bill" Rein
hart was on the mound for Stanford
and had the Boyle boys eating out of
his hand all the way through. Davis,
,the Danville pitcher, was the only
man of the team who could slam his
delivery at all safely and the visitors
were completely outclassed from
start to finish. In the fourth inning,
Stanford worked the famous
"squeeze play for four runs, one
right after" tfye other. The score :

High School News
The baseball team from the grades
are having a little "tuff luck" this
season, having played three games
and won only one. They were de
feated first by Hustonville and then
they were victorious over Danville.
The last game was played at Lancas
ter which proved disastrous to them
in a ten to nine contest. These games
show much material and bright pros
pects are seen from several players.
The battery for Stanford Saturday
was Ballou twirler and Hill, back
stop. Ballou showel much "stuff"
but retired from the game in the
seventh in order that their other
pitcher, Dudderar might have a little
practice.
Stith Noe sprained his ankle in the
game Monday and it proved very
painful. Although he is limmn
rather badly at the present it is hop
ed that he will soon be all right.
In the track meet held at Danville
Friday, Stanford High School land
ed third place in a number of points.
There were not many representatives
from here but those who did take
part showed much class. As usual the
Embry brothers, Sam and Joe T.,
distinguished themselves while the
other members of the team, Noe,
Tucker and Perkins did remarkably
well.
In the Richmond game John Cash,
"the all star player" had the misfor
tune to get an ugly gash cut in his
leg from one of the opponents'
spikes. He gamely played on, how
ever, until his team mates saw how
badly he was hurt and made him re
tire from the game. A doctor was
summoned and several stitches had
to be taken.
Friday afternoon an exhibition was
held in the sewing department and
several patrons were out. After
thoroughly inspecting some of the
fine works of the girls they were
very gracefully served with refresh
ments by the Freshman girls.

j STE ARS WINS AT
NICHOLASVILLE
Helms Turns Down Bob Hunter's
Friend For Postoffice Congres
sional Politics "Warming Up"
The following dispatch from Wash
ington in Saturday's Louisville Pose
will be of interest here and in this
section for Mr. Stears is one of the
best known newspapermen in the
state, and his appointment will prove
a very popular one with the press
boys:
"Representative Helm today rec
ommended J. B. Stears, editorof the
Jessamine County News and presi
dent of the State Newspaper Asso
ciation, for postmaster at Nicholas
ville. The office becomes vacant May
1."
Col. Stears thus wins out in one
of the most interesting fights for x
postoffice waged in Kentukcy since
President Wilson went into "office.
The fight for the Nicholasville office
narrowed down to Col. Stears, who
is editor of the Jessamine News, and
David Bell, a prominent business man
and democrat of Nicholasville. The
latter had the backing of Col. Robert
M. Hunter, and other democratic
leaders of Jessamine, and neighbor
ing counties, who believed their man
a certain winner, but Editor Stears
flashed under the wire first, and will
be heartily congratulated by his
many friends of the "press gang"
He richly deserves the appointment.
j having championed Congressman
Helm n his newspaper tor a number
of years, and in thus being rewarded,
is only receiving his just due.
Friends of Candidates Busy
Friends of both Senator Charles
F. Montgomery, who is the only an
nounced candidate for congress in
this district so, far, were said to be
quite busy at Richmond Monday, it
being county court day there and
also at Harrodsburg. A delegation
of Lincoln county friends of Con
gressman Helm went to Harrods
burg in machines and put in the af
ternoon boosting him. They say Helm
is very strong in Mercer. The dele
gation was composed of County At
torney W. S. Burch. Deputy Sheriff
W. S. Drye, T. J. Hill, Jr., E. D. Pen
nington. E. T. Pence, Sr., and R. L.
Porter. Former Senator R. L. Hubble,
of this county and Col. T. C. Rankin,
of Garrard, who were in Richmond.
Monday, say that they found quite
a large number of the leading demo
crats there already enthusiastic for
Senator Montgomery.
Montgomery Here Saturday
Senator Montgomery came to
Stanford Saturday and spent most
of the day meeting friends in this and
from other counties, in the big crowd
which was on hand that day. His
friends say he was given assurances
of support from party leaders in this
and other sections, which insure him
a very gratifying following all
through this section. Senator Mont
gomery expressed himself as greatly
pleased with his campaign so far,
which has hardly as yet been launch
ed, and declared that he is confident
of being nominated in the primary
on Aug. 5.
Helm Emissary in Boyle
The Danville Advocate said Mon
day: "Hon. George Willis, of Shelby
ville, was in Danville Saturday elec
tioneering for Congressman Harvey
Helm. He found little encourage
ment here. In Danville it is next to
impossible to find a voter for Helm.
He has lost almost entirely his past
strength here."

many years of such good health as
she is now enjoying.
THE I. J. AT CRAB ORCHARD.

How Mrs. Harrod Got Rid of Her
Stomach Trouble.
"I suffered with stomach trouble
for years and tried everything I
heard of, but the only relief I got
was temporary until last spring I saw
Chamberlain's Tablets advertised and
procured a bottle of them at our
drug store. I got immediate relief
from that dreadful heaviness after
eating and from pain in the stomach"

Wayne. Ind. Obtainable everywhere.
