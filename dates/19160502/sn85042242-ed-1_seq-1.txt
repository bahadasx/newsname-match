Secretary Baker Prepares Fur­
ther Orders for Generals
Scott and Funston.
GEN. SCOTT IN FAVOR OF
IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL
"Villa's Bandits No Longer a
Menace," Says Mexican Am­
bassador Arredondo.
Washington, May 1.—President Wil­
son has not' altered his purpose to
keep American troops in the border
region of Mexico until brigandage has
come to an end.
After a brief conference at the
White House today, Secretary Baker
prepared further instructions for Gen­
erals Scott and Funston, sought by
the officers as a result' of their con­
ference with Gen. Obregon, Carran
za's war minister.
It is believed the American con­
ferees sought additional instructions
because Gen. Obregon dwelt upon the
view of the de facto government that
the American expedition should be
withdrawn at once.
Eliasio Arredondo, Mexican ambas­
sador designate, called on Secretary
Lansing during the day to renew his
rgumerits in favor of the early wilh
raway. He was informed that the
Me department would not lake up
diplomatic discussion of this sub-

the military conference at El

Arredondo indicated the feel

are satisfied that Villa's band
are no longer to be looked upon
Its a menace to the peace of the coun­
try." he said. "The American troops
(should be withdrawn to restore pros
loerity among the people. It is be
Jleved that Villa either haw been killed
or iriv#nX) refuse whore he will no
longer molest either Americans or
Mexicans. The bandits have been
well dispersed and their forces mater­
ially reduced.
"There is, however, an increasing
suspicion aiiiong some of our people
that the American troops are remain­
ing in Mexico for some other motives
than to pursue the bandits."
The ambassador acted under gener­
al instructions from his government in
renewing his request for a reply to
Gen. Carranza's note, suggesting that
the time had come to take up the
question of withdrawal.
The dispatch sent to Gen. Scott to­
night was supplemental to one sent
y6st6rdfty«
The reports of the conference are
Isigned jointly by Generals Scott and
Funston. Lacking explicit instruc­
tions, it is doubtful that Gen. Scott
would attempt to make any reply to
Gen. Obreson's request for withdrawal
of the troops. There is little doubt
that the additional instructions out­
lined the administration's views in
this regard so clearly that Gen. Obre­
gon will have no doubt as to what
Gen. Chrranza will be told when a re­
ply to his note is made.
In some quarters in touch with
Mexican developments it was said
that the president was handling the
situation personally and had no ques­
tions tor decision to lay before his
cabiilet tomorrow.
It was stated officially that no for­
mal demand for the withdrawal of the
troops had been made by any repre­
sentatives of. the de facto government.
PLANS MUST NOT BE
FOR IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL
Information from Washington that
Secretary Baker had instructed Gen.
Scott and Gen. Funston to make it
plain to Gen. Obregon that, any agree­
ment reached at their conference here
must not be ast-d on any plans for
immediate withdrawal was received
with gravity in Juare tonight.
General Obregon refused to com­
ment, raying he would await develop­
ments at his next conference with the
Americans. This, it was expected to­
night, would take place tomorrow, al­
though it was thought possible it
might be delayed until after the regu­
lar Tuesday cabinet meeting at Wash­
ington. Among other Mexican offi­
cials, gloom was openly expressed. It
was pointed out' that Gen. Obregon
had come to the border confident that
they could persuade Gen. Scott and
Gen. Funston that the expeditionary
forces should be withdrawn at once.
Secretary Baker's instructions to
the American conferrees were regard­
ed as completely blocking the Ameri­
can Mexican minister of war.
It was declared at the next confer­
ence the only course he could take
would be to expect the United States
government to cooperate in the com­
plete dispersal of the Villistas band
still operating in southern Chihuahua
and Durango.
It was argued that the de facto gov
rrnment could not afford a break with
the United States, whose recognition
had given it stability. An open agree­
ment might result in intervention and
it was further declared that those per
responsible for such an occur

Labor Trouble
Is Begun on the
First of May
New York, May 1.—May Day, feat­
ured here by a monBtrous parade of
union workers, also was marked by
the beginning of new labor disorders
as well as the settlement of several
strikes in the metropolitan district.
The paraders carried banners and
cards. Members of the garment mak­
ers trade predominated. Bakers,
shoemakers, wood workers, clothing
and shirt makers also were in line.
The day began with a,strike of en­
gineers and firemen on tug boats and
freighters, but by nightfall many of
the owners had acceded to the de­
mands for increased wages and the
water traffic situation, which was
threatened with an almost complete
tie-up, was improved.

lessons of the war in Europe," was
the theme of an address by President.
Wilson today at the opening of the
national service school military en­
campment for young women.
In concluding, the President voiced
a warning that the honor and integri­
ty of the United States cannot be
tampered with. He prayed that the
country should not be drawn into war,
but declared that if it should be, "in
the great voice of national egthus.'

world would stand once more thrilled
to hear the voice of the new world
asserting the standard of justice and
liberty."
The president expressed confidence
that in time of trouble, the great mass
of foreign born citizens of the United
States would be loyal.
"I never had the slightest doubt of
what would happen when America
calls upon those of her citizens born
in other countries to come to the sup­
port of the flag," he said. "Why, they
will come with cheers, they will come
with a momentum which willl make
us realize that America has once
more been cried awake out of every
sort of distemper and dream and dis­
traction will be cast out of the confi­
dence of a great nation upon the in­

Bismarck Citizens Are Resolved
to Place Their City in the
Front Ranks.
SPECIAL COMMITEE TO
MAKE INVESTIGATION
Will Take Hold of Work and
Push It as Far as Is
Possible.
"Bismarck's paving boom received a
frgsh impetus last week from the let­
ting
of contracts for $160,000 worth of
bitulithic by the city commission of
Mandan. 'Bismarck citizens are re­
solved that their city shall not be out­
stripped by any neighbor, and while
there has been no lack of enthusi­
asm at any time since the plans for
the nine-mile paving district were
originally announced, the certainty of
our sister city's going ahead with
27 to 30 hicks of new paving this sea­
son has added new vigor to the cam­
paign.
The task of checking up the front­
age already signed is now in progress.
There seems to be no doubt that well
over the 51 per cent required by law
is already subscribed, but the Com­
mercial club paving committee, which
has the campaign in charge, will wait
until after several important board
meeting during the first week in May,
which are expected to add about 2(
per cent to the fronage already pro­
cured.
There is much discussion as to the
personnel of the special paving com­
mission, which is to be named by the
property holders, to co-operate with
the city commission in supervising
the great improvement project. Pres­
ident A. W. Lucas has declared him­
self in favor of the selection of such
a committee, and property-holders
generally feel that the magnitude of
the undertaking is such that, the civ
commission should not be expected
to assume the entire burden. The
special committee will be composed
of' riJjjiK-'SitiUaii'Ai Bismarck* citizens,
who have had much experience in
public works, and it is probable that
this commission will be called upon to
spend a great deal of time in investi­
gating the paving experience of other
cities.
To date no general preference has
been expressed at to the quality of
paving or materials to be used. This
matter will come before the property
holders for decision before any con­
tracts are let, and it would bo well for
those affected to make a general study
of the situation. The question of orig­
inal expense will be of less import­
ance than the wearing qualities and
permanence of the paving laid. At
the same time, there must be taken
into consideration the varying traffic
conditions, and the fact that it prob­
ably will not be necessary to use as
heavy a type of paving in the resi­
dence districts, where the wear and
tear will be less.
lEismarck already enjoys natural ad­
vantages superior to those of any oth­
er city in North Dakota. With the
greater portion of the city paved,
there wlil not be a town in the north
west to compare with the! capial city
in attractiveness. And in this day,
attractiveness is a real community
asset. In the case of paving, beauty
and utility go hand in hand, for no
one who will glance back over the
large sums expended every year in
temporary street improvements which
were undone by the first rain which
fell, can fail fo appreciate the fact
that our natural earth roads have
been an extravagance far more costly
than the most expensive form of pav­
ing can ever be.
The Commercial club is indebtc'l
to its volunteer committeemen for
splendid co-operation in the prelimi
nary work. One man last week in a
few hours procured signatures for
more than 3,000 feet of paving. All
have been liberal with their time, and
have worked with a sincerity of pur­
pose which has produced results. In
years to come, these men will be
deemed entitled to an especial niche
in Bismarck's temple of patriots.
Remarkable real estate activity is
already noted as a result of the cer­
tainty of javing. Propery values have
increased and the demand for resi­
dence lots inside the paving district
is heavy, while those not so favored
have temporarily taken a back seat.
There is very little frontage in tttv
entire tract of 91 square blocks which
could not be sold today for an enhanc­
ed consideration equal to several
times the cost of paving. No better
proof could be found that this form
of improvement is an investment rath­
er than a tax.
With Mandan and Bismarck both
paved, the Missouri valley will boast
of two of the most progressive and
desirable cities on the line of the
Northern 'Pacific. In the case of Bis­
marck the effects of this improve­
ment will be particularly important in
attracting to the city, as a home,
scores of retired farmers and busi­
ness men from the smaller communi­
ties, who will fawr the town which
can offer them the most advantages,
and who will be impressed with B?5
Daarck's superiority in their frequent
visits to the capital and on their busi­
ness missions to the city.

Colonel Roosevelt Well Pleased
at Acceptance of His Prepar­

TIME OF CRISIS IN
THE NATION'S CAREER
"Great Question Not Involved in
Factional Politics," Says
Ex-President.
Xew York, May 1.—Col. Theo. Roos­
evelt, on his return here tonight from
Chicago, issued a statement express­
ing gratification at the reception of his
views on "preparedness, national duty
and Americanism,". in the middle
west. Col. Roosevelt declared he is
not interested in the political fortunes
of himself and others, and after out­
lining the principles advocated in re­
cent speeches, said:,
Crisis For Nation.
"It cannot be said too often that
this is the time of crisis in the na­
tion's career. We are now laying
d%wn the foundation and the control­
ling lines of a new era in our history.
Everything that 1 can do will be done
to see that the people west and east
realize the facts and act accordingly.
No Politics Involved.
"I?y no act of ra.'fi*. by no word of
mine, has this great '.inestion been in­
volved in factional nolitics. In every
state in which the law governs such
matters, nave withdrawn my name
from all factional i-misgles. As re­
gards myself, 1 do not believe the del­
egates out to nominate me at Chicago,
unless they are pr pared both heart­
ily and without' reserve to make the
fight along the lints above outlined."
LAST PETITIONS
KILL BE. FILED
Now Certain That Courts Will
Have to Determine Validity
of Petitions.
NUMBER OF VOTERS
IS ALSO A QUESTION
The last of the petitions to be filed
•by t.ho Xew Rock turd Capital Remov­
al association -will likely be filed with
the secretary of state today. The pe­
titions, according to officers of the as­
sociation, are on their way to the
capital city by express and should be
delivered to the secretary of statu
some time today.
While the petitions will be accept­
ed for filing as they come in, there
is no way for the secretary of state
to determine what constitutes the
number of legal voters in a county.
The poll liss are far from accu­
rate. For instance, according to the
poll list of Cass county, at the last
general election in 1014, there were
4,827 voters while, according to the
registration "books, there were 6,06$.
In other counties the same holds true,
as the following figures will show:
County Poll List Registered
Benson 1,917 2,524
McLean 2,272 2.988
Stutsman 2,624 3,800
The same is true in practically every
county in the state. The 1'916 regis­
tration books will greatly increase
the number of qualified voters in the
state, but will not contain anywhere
near all the names.
The secretary of state has wired all
the county auditors to send in the
number of qualified voters according
to the 1*914 registration, but is still at
a loss how to determine the exact
number which is necessary according
to the interpretation of the law, which
says: "Petitions must contain the
names of 25 per cent of the legal vot­
ers."
There is no doubt but that the
courts will have to pass on the suffi
ciency of the petitions, and also de­
termine the number of legal voters in
each county, before the removal prop­
osition can be submittsd to the vot­
ers.
HNS CLOSED FOR
Lincoln, Neb., May 1.—All saloons
in Lincoln were closed today for an
indefinite period, as a result of a
blanket remonstrance filed at the in­
stance of prohibition leaders.
Today was the beginning of the new
license, and the excise board is favor­
able to the renewal of licenses, but in
the face of the remonstrance its
hands are tied. The saloon question
was not voted ^on in Lincoln this year
and the power to open the saloons
rest's with the excise board, unless
the members are stopped by court ac­
tion.

"CONGRESS STANDS BEHIND

Berlin, via London, May 1.—Discus­
sion over the answer to the American
note continued Sunday at great head­
quarters wihout a conclusion being
reached, according to advices to the
Lokal Anzeiger.
The newspapers, for the most, part,

lische Rundschau, however, give some
consideration to the subject.
Herr Bernhard considers the situ­
ation still grave and voices a warning
against too great optimism. He de­
clares the final decision "depends
solely" on President Wilson.
Congress Behind President.
"There would be no greater mis­
take," he says, "than the expectation
that the American congress might
reach a different decision than the
president. The time for exercising
influence on the American people and
their rpresentatives is past. It is not
doubted now that congress stands be­
hind President Wilson the German
leaders who have the task of framing
the German answer must remember
this.
No Half-way Measures.
"We could understand any decision,
no matter what it is, under the self
understandable condition that it pre­
serves German's dignity, but there
must be no half-way measure," says
'Herr Bernhard, "and the decision
reached must create a final and en­
during fate."

obtain with certainty a staule that

or consideration for the future th&t
should govern. He points out the fact,
that the offensive has been the guid­
ing spirit of Prussia's and Germany's
military operations since the time of
Frederick the Great, and concludes:
"And if our statesmen, in reaching
a decision in the light of their infor­
mation on all the conditions involved,
believe that they must do so in the
face of uncertainty as to what the
purposes of the parly are, they will
have to take into consideration the
question whether in such cases it is
not wiser to take the lead themselves
rather than be forced to play to the
needs of the other player."
URGE MEN TO
RETURN TO WORK
Chicago, May 1.—The 1. H. C. today
addressed its 5,000 striking employees
in newspaper advertisements, remind­
ing them that while the munition fac­
tories have offered them more wages,
peace is sure to return to the coun­
tries and more business will come to
the company, and urged them to re­
turn to their jobs.
CANNOT WRITE
NAMES ON BALLOT
Mitchell, S. D., May 1.—Names of
presidential candidates may no be
written on the ballot at the state pri
marv election May 23, according to a
ruling made today by Attorney Gener­
al C. Caldwell. Under this version of
the primary law, enacted by special
legislative session in February, it will
be impossible for followers of either
Col. Roosevelt or Justice Hughes to
vote their preference for candidates.
It is said backers and proposed fol­
lowers of Roosevelt may take the mat­
ter immediately into court and seek
to obtain a speedy decision.
BILL IS DEFEATED
Washington, May 1.—The adminis­
tration's fight for the Philippine Inde­
pendence bill with its Clark amend­
ment, authorizing independence for
the Islands within four years, was lost
toniKht in the house.
After voting 213 to 165 to strike out
the Clark amendment, the house, by a
vote of 2"il to 17, passed as a substi­
tute for the entire measure the Jones
bill, providing for a greater measure
of self-government in the Philippines
and carrying a preamble declaring
the intention of the United States to
grant independence ultimately, but
without fixing a date.
Over heated debates of administra­
tion leaders, the house by a vote of
203 to 54, instructed its conferees not
to agree to any declaration setting a
definite time for granting the Islands
their independence. Speaker Clark
named Representative Jones of "Vir­
ginia and Garrett of Tennessee, demo­
crats, and Towner of Iowa, republican,
as conferees.

German-American relations probably
can be looked forward to with less ap­
prehension. The Associated Press Is
permitted to make this statement, al­
though dispatches on the German note
have been stopped by the censorship.
The deliberations at war headquar­
ters have been concluded and Ambas­
sador Gerard will leave this evening
for Berlin, arriving Tuesday after­
noon. The German reply Is expected
with littfe delay, but. it is considered
undesirable that preliminary indica­
tions of the nature of the note should
be published.
ST PAUL CITY BH
Police Believe Robber Was Jay
Allan, Who Robbed Western
State Bank.
St. Paul, Minn., May 1.—Shortly
after noon today a lone bandit enter­
ed the City Bank ol' St. Paul, forced
the four bank employees who were
present to enter the vault, and escap­
ed with $3,000 in gold and currency.
Tonight the largest drag net of po­
lice in the history of the city has been
thrown out, in an ,effort by Chief of
Police James .1. O'Connor, to capture
the lone bandit.
The bandit is believed by the police
to be "Jay Allen," who six months ago
robbed the Western State bank, escap­
ing with more than- $2,000. After he
made good his escape from the city,
lie .wrote Vs.w the police taunt­
ing'thetri because of their inability to
capture him and advising them that
ho would return to the city and "pick
another soft one."
After he left the bank today, lie
walked a half block to an automobile
which was waiting for him, and was
driven toward the heart of the city,
according to passersby who saw him
leave the bank after he had picked up
all the available money.

AGREEMENT HOPED
FOR ARMY BILL
(Washington. May 1.—Hope for an
agreement in conference on the army
reorganization bill seemed brighter
tonight after an agreement for ne­
gotiations of differences between the
house and senate was reached. Sen­
ate conferees agreed to yield on the
proposd standing army of 250,000
men and to accept a peace strength of
180,000 men, providing the house
would accept the expansion system in
the senate bill. Under this system,
the array could be increased in time
of conflict to 220,000 men, or more.
Senate conferees are still holding
out for the federal volunteer army, as
well as their prposed system of fed­
eralization of the National Guard, but
house leaders insist they will win
their fight to eliminate the volunteer
army and retain the National Guard
provision.

The statement says:
"All he rebels in Dublin have sur­

that hopes were entertained that arms
would be handed in today in the city
court.
"During the night of April 30-May 1,
the rebels in Enniscorty made an of­
fer to...surrender their lwidgrs and
arms on condition that the rank and.
file be allowed to return to "their
homes. They were advised uncondi
ional surrender only would be consid­
ered. These terms were accepted by
them at 0 o'clock this morning. It
was reported later that the rebefc

terms.
"A column, composed of soldiers
and loyal Irish constabulary captured
seven prisoners in the neighborhood
of Fern Liberas County Wexford, to­
day.
Wjcklow, Arklow, Dunlaven and the
counties of Cork, Claire, Limerick and
Kerry are quiet. The province of
Ulster is quiet."
Germans Repulsed.
The repulse by the French of power­
ful German attacks around Dead
Man's Hill, and counter attacks to the
north of Cumieres, has again been fol­
lowed by heavy German bombard­
ments of these sections, and a contin­
uation of the shelling of Cote du Poi

have been launched by the Germans.
In sapping operations in the Argon

by the explosion of the mines to take
a portion of the crater.
In the southern sections of the Hus­
