'REGISTRAR AGREES
TO LET SUNLIGHT IN
YBaujjht Changes His Mind
About Publishing Pre
cinct Lists.
Rprial to The World.
ML SKOGKU. May 1. R. L. Haugh,
county registrar, who Saturday
dtcllned to (rive out for publication
litis of precinct registrars, changed
his mind today and tbo names of the
rtglstrars have been made public.
Baugh said the list had not been
completed Saturday and that that was
the reason he had refused to give
them out.
At that time, however, he emphati
cally Mated that he would not make
the lists public and Republicans who
n et to inquiry him were simply told
that if they were registered in 1914
they would not be entitled to register
uain this yeur. That was at, much
utistaction as they got. In response
to a telegram sent to Joe Morris, sec
retary of the state election board,
fiaturdiy. asking If Buugh had been
Instructed to withhold the lists from
publication, a reply was received to-
duy statlnu that the county registrar
as instructed to carry out the law.
Tbut was as fur us the telegram went
It Is believed,-however, that stories
published In Tulsa and Muskogee
papers dealing with Itaugh s refusal to
turn over the names of his registrars,
had much to do with his uction tdoay
in voluntarily turning over the lists
to the newspapers. A number of Deni.
ocrais had joined Republicans In pro
teating against his arbitrary action.

the approval of the sale of any of th
property upon which bids were sub

blood member of the council, did not
attend the meeting. Following the
council's action, several full-blood
members expressed the belief that the
council had made a blunder in ac
cepting the bids for the Harnsdall and
other properties and tried to excuse
their action by declaring they had not
understood the action tbut was taken,
having labored under the belief that

WASHINGTON, May I. I'rcsi
dent Wilson has not altered
his purpose to keep American troops
in the border region of Mexico until
brigandage has come to an end.
After a brief conference at the
White House today Secretary Maker
prepared further Instructions for
Generals Scott and Funston. sought
by the officers us a result of their
Conference with General Obreuun,
.l.'arra Ilia's war minister. Thu tnes
'sage went forward tonight-.- It fon-
tents was not revruled hut both Sec
retary Lansing and Secretary l'aker
said there had been no change in the
administration's policy.
It is believed the American con
ferees sought additional instructions
because General Obregon dwelt upon
the view of tho de facto government
that the American expedition should
be withdrawn at once. As General
Scott had no powet to discuss this
matter he presented what the Mex
ican war minister had to say to
Washington.
Insists on Withdrawal.
Eliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambas
sador-designate, called on Secretary
Lunsing during the day to renew his
argument in favor of the early with
drawal, lie followed closely the line
taken by General obregon in his ex
change of views with Generals Scott
and Funston. lie was informed that
the state depatrment would not take
up any diplomatic discussion of this
subject us urged by General Car
ratiza until utter the military con
ference ut Ml 1'uso had concluded.
"The American troops should be
withdrawn to restore tranquility
among the people. It ts believed that
Villa either bus been killed or driven
to refuge where he will no longer
molest either Americans or Mexicans.
"The bandits have been well
dispersed and their forces materially
reduced.
"There is, however, an increasing
suspicion .among somu of our people
that the American troops ore remain
ing In Mexico for some other motive
than to pursue the bundits."
The ambassador acted under gen
eral instructions from his government
in renewing bis request for u reply
to General Carranza's note suggest
ing that the time hud come to take
up the question of withdrawal. He hud
heard nothing directly or indirectly
from the conference ut Ml I'aso and
said his efforts with the state depart
ment were independent of General
Obregon's discussion with General
Scott, although with the same object,

member of the council, Osuge Super
intendent Wright advocated an ac

Chief who is said to have blocked
an effort to reconsider tho vote of
the council. Attorneys representing
John Palmer and Franklin Shaw have

un injunction to prevent Secretary
lAne from approving new leases to

forth that there is no possibility of
the Osuges receiving less for their oil

headquarters this evening, covering
the first day of registration under the

Democratic majority of tho leglslu
lure ut the special ($50,000) session
culled by Governor Williams In Janu

Chairman Arthur II. Geissler of the
state committee received a wire com
munication this evening from William
Higglns of Uartlosville, member of
thu state Republican committee from
Washington county, to the effect thut
in a considerable number of precincts
there were no registrars and In some
others thev refused to act: that tho
county registrar, whose duty It was
to see that there was a registrar in
every precinct, could not be round in
the county.

It was also stated thut citiiu'tis of

Democrats and Socialists, w ho had be
come indignant over the matter, had
called a public meeting for Monday
night and intended tuking whatever
act bill seemed necessary to bring

In thu communication from Mr.
Higgins it wuh expressly stated that
tho men said to have been appointed

that many voters were finding It im

When the conditions reported from
Mnrtlosvillo wore placed before the
headquarters of the state election
hoard this evening assurunces were
mado that tho matter would be taken
up Immediately und If it were a fact
the county registrars could not be lo
cated, as reported, that some one else
would bo appointed at once.
Democratic stato headquarters re
ported that no complaints had come
there, "that a number of county and
precinct registrars hud culled from
various purls of the stute asking for
Information relative to registration,
but thut no trouble wus being encuun-
teicu in tno registration.
No Confusion There.
The registration started off without

DL'HLIN, May 1. (via l.ndon)
A return to normal conditions is be
ing accomplished gradually in Dublin
and It is now possible to give the first
complete account of the huppcuingj
of tho last week. Hitherto news of the
Dublin uprising has reached the out
side world In fragmentary form owing
to the interruption of telegraphic
communication, the censorship and
tho frequent conflict of statement but
tho collapse of the rebellion has re
moved these conditions In great part.
When the irreconcilable opponents
of lliitish rule in Ireland proclaimed
the republic last Mondny, their movo
was looked on generally as a mere dis
play of fanaticism. It was soon found, '
however, thut It was no mere demon
stration but an outbreak which had
behind it a fair organization and suf
ficient force to strangle the life of tim
capital and compel tho authorities to
send for military assistance from
Mnglund. At no time, however, did tho
military or civil authorities consider
the revolt a menace to tho goern-
nor diil they have anv feats of
their ability to cope with it quickly
us soon us its extent became apparent.
