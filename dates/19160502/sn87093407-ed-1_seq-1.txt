Acting Editor of The Seattle Star Today.
I WOULD make a special appeal to the men of the West to awake to the invidious
position of their own women who have been enfranchised by a mere state amend
ment. The men and women voters of the suffrage states are not on a plane of
equality, because the man is protected under the great fundamental law of the nation,
the United States constitution.
****** ******
MKN have written the charter of their liberty in that instrument, hut they have for
gotten to do women the same service. Article V guarantees men a republican
form of government, but women live under a male obligarchy in 36 of the states.
41***** ******
UNDKR the XIV amendment, a state which disfranchises a male citizen receives
just punishment by the cutting down of its representation; but state after state
disfranchises women with impunity. Ihe XV amendment protects men of every race
and color in their political freedom, but sex remains the one brand of political slavery.
A man from a suffrage state can take up his residence in any other state he chooses,
and he will enjoy his full rinhts as an American citizen. No so with the women of the
suffrage states. Let one of them dare to migrate to Nebraska, to Massachusetts, to
New York, and she will find herself a political outcast.
* * * * * * ******
A MAN is free to marry the woman of his choice without jeopardy to his political
rights and, above all, to his citizenship. 11c can marry an alien, a whole string of
alien women, one after the other, and he remains what he is, an American citizen,
with all the rights of a citizen.
****** ******
BUT let a woman venture to fall in love and marry just one foreigner, and, tho he
be domiciled in this country, that woman loses not only her vote, but she is made
into what she is not, an alien.
****** ******
f I///.77' a travesty of justicel There is supreme need that the enfranchisement of
women, as well as that of men. should he written into the federal constitution.
Regard for their own women should push men in the free states into putting their
shoulders to the wheel and rolling up a great voting constituency behind the demand
for a national woman suffrage amendment.

STRIKE BLOWS
FOR SUFFRAGE
Women Speakers Exhort Big Audience at
Mass Meeting Held in Theatre; Appeal
for Voters' United Aid
The message of the un
enfranchised women of the
East was delivered to an
audience that filled the
Moore theatre Monday
night, at the Congres
sional union mass meet-
ing.
Envoy from the "Suf
frage Special," who have
come West to aid
from their visiting sisters,
pointed the way that will
lead to national woman's
suffrage.
At the end or the busy (lay a
peaceful spirit filled the hearts of
the workers.
It was the feeling that the pll
mintage across the continent had
not been in \ain, and that a newer,
stronger bond had been woven,
uniting women of Fast and Went
In their common tusk.
Woman Judge Presides
Justice Rhea May Whitehead,
who presided at the meeting, greet
ed the envoys, after she herself
had been Introduced by Mrs, Harry
Whitney Treat.
"The women of Washington
should feel that as long as there is
a single woman In the United
States who wants to vote, but who
cannot, there remains a tusk for
us to perform," she said.
Visiting speakers who followed
her wore: Mrs. John Rogers, Jr.,
of New York Miss fidith fioode. of
the l'litrirt of Columbia, and Mm.
Harriot Stanton lllatch of New
York.
Must Unite Vote
Mrs Rojters pointed out that the
the women voters could direct the
balance of power If they intelli
gently united their vote.
"The women of the United
States wish enfranchisement on
equal terms with men." she said.
"This ran be secured only by a fed
eral amendment. It is the quick
est and the most dignified way to
win the ballot
Hold Freedom In Hands
"Suffrage for all women can
come now If the women voters
wish It.
"They hold the freedom of their
unenfranchised sisters In the hol
low of their hands,
"I believe they will answer Joy
ously to our appeal to them to put
Federal Suffrage above all other
Issues and Insist on the passage of
the amendment now. 1 believe
that they will refuse to support the
dominant party if It fails to pass
(he Suh in H Anthony amendment
during this session of congress."
