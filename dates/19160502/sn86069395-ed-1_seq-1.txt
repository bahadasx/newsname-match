first barley-producing state, accord
ing to results of crop production last
season. Kentucky holds her own as
first in tobacco.
v Win. C. Sumpter, the new presi
dent of the T. P. A., is "little but
loud." Ho is built very much along
the lines of Ed Gaither and Mose Elb
but ho delivers the goods. His home
paper, the Messenger, says of him;
"Mr. Sumpter for ten years, was
president of the Bowling Green Busi
ness Men's Protective Association,
and held this office until he resigned
a few weeks ago. He made a splen
did president, one who was attentive
to his duties nt all times ami who use(i
his best efforts in helping to make a
better Bowling Green. Ho will use
the same energy In serving as presi
dent of the T. P. Ai and the selection
of tho association is a good one. Tho
twenty-six delegates who left hero on
Friday morning went with the deter
mination of seeing that Mr. Sumpter
was given this high honor, which will
bo good news to tho many friends w
this popular Bowling Green, business
man."
