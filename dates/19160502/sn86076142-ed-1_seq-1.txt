SILVER IS LEGAL CURRENCY
FRENCH 611116
BEFORE VETO
So much local Interest was evinced
in the remarks of Moreton Frewen,
the eminent English financial author
ity, on the gold and silver situation, as
given In these columns yesterday, that
an Interview with Frewen In the An
nalist Is reprinted herewith:
"The problem of the world curren
cy after the war," Bald Frewen, "Is:
not, of course, decipherable at this
time. ' It Involves the question, 'When
will the war end?' In my Judgment,
not for two years. But It Is quite safe
to discuss the tendencies of finance
and currency. , !
"You ask, 'Can the universal gold
standard survive?' I do not think so.
it was a deplorable and dangerous ex
periment from the first, and it In
- volves a problem which no one can
answer because the problem Is clean
outside of all human experience hith
erto." "And that problem?"
"The problem of sliver. We are now
for the first time 'up against It!' In
war; lor the first time In the history
of mankind a great war is in progress
and the world's mints are closed to
: silver. Whatever our views and our J
dlMgreements, that great and sinister
fact stands out.
"In the last great continental war.
the Franco-German war, the German
mints were open to both metals at a
ratio of one to fifteen and a half, and
American mints were open to both
metals at sixteen to one. And not less
Important was this the mints of Brit
ish India were open to the free coinage
of silver, gold there-being rightly 1e
monetized.''
"Hut has not the Immense produc
tion of new gold made universal gold
standardlsm possible?"

PARIS, May 2. Important gain In

slope of Dead Man's hill General Pe
train's troops Sunday took German
trenches along a front of about three-
fifths of a mile, by a depth of 500 or
600 yards. Southeast of Fort Daunia-
unt a first line German trench of 500
yards was captured.

Take the returns of tlie exports of the

In 1913, while, in those years of quite
unprecedented gold production, gold
money, 840,00ti.0oo in 1893, has not
nearly doubled.
"Hut accepting your view and still
bearing In mind the strong prejudice
as to silver" (an utterly Insane pre
judice, Mr. Frewen Interpolated), "can
not the world of trade adjust Itself to
'soft money' ?"
"Emphatically no! That Is chaos

frame your tariffs if your vast market

lions with varying gold premiums'
What use Is a tariff In New York
harbor If the German exchange Is
fifty points off? Germany will deluge
you with her goods."
"Your reply, then, to my question is
that the so called 'gold standard' is
doomed, and that some arrangement
must be made to employ as full legal
tender currency the two metals."
''Yes! That, at least, Is my view.
The war will conclude to find the Uni
ted Slates congested with gold. There
must follow orgies of speculation; j
long periods of high prices in the Unl-j
ted States, attracted by which Europe, j
with masses of inconvertible paper,

SHERIFF AND RANCHER
VICTIMS OF BULLETS
Illy Aaaoi-lntral I'rraa. I
EL PASO, May 2. Generals Scott
and Funston held an extended con
ference over the amplified Instruc
tions from Washington, the adminis
tration stating no agreement is to be
reached based on any proposition for
the immediate withdrawal of troops
from, Mexico. .
The next conference with Obregon
oerhaos will be held this afternoon
and indications are that It will be the
last one. The Mexican conferees
are disappointed.
Tungesten has received a back set
owing to the arrival of several large
cargoes which bad been delayed by
passage through the straights of Magel
Inn. The famine caused by the failure
of these shipments to arrive was res
ponsible for the fancy prices paid
within the past sixty and ninety days
but now It is assumed that prices have
grown normal at about $50 per unit of
60 per cent tungstic acid. The penalty
is on dollar per unit for every unit
under 60 per cent and a premium Is
paid for every unit over that standard
Under the new order of business no
tungsten under 50 per cent will be
accepted at any price and shippers
will have to concentrate up to the full
60 per cent.
The highest price paid for tungsten
has been $110 per unit to a few small
shippers in Boulder county, Colorado,
but most of the long time contracts
have been placed around $60. Even
at these figures there is no danger
of the man with a tungsten mine be
coming a county charge since the quo
tations represent a value of $3,000 a
ton. Some orders were placed re
cently for $70 per ton but these were
rare exceptions and could not bevr
garded as normal.
Discoveries of tungsten and develop
ment of the Industry have proceeded
so rapidly that the present supply is
fully eqifal to the demand and if there
is any material Increase in the ton
nage placed on the market there Is
every indication that the quotation
will go lower. When It is considered
that the price before the war 'fas
as low as $8 per unit and shippers
made money at that rate there Is not
much room for a miner to develop
grouch when he receives $50. The
recent shipment from Round Mountain
stored In the vaults of the Tonopah
Banking Corporation remains there
awaiting another consignment from
the same source. Both shipments will
go forward by Wells Fargo about the
first of next week.
