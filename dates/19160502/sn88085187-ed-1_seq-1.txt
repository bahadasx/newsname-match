BY WALTER LIPPMANN.
Theodore Roosevelt in probably better known
than any other man has even been during his life
time.
Napoleon had I reputation in his day, but be died
before the modern newapaper, the telegram, and the
photograph had come into use.
The German emperor is ■ man of some promin
ence, but he Uvea in the ohsciirity of divine tight.
Theodore Roosevelt we know, as we know the
weather. There are times when he warms our
hearts and times when he thunders and flashes,
times when he is serene and others when he blows
bard. He is often a long series of squalls, and then
ugain life-giving as the spring.
There are some who lik-e him all the time. They
adore him constantly for the sake of his variety.
There are others, like Mr. Root, Miss Jane Ad
dams. Mr. Taft, and Mr. Penrose who can take him
only at certain seasons. But one thing about him is
worth noting.
Whatever the predominant issue may be, Roose
velt is always the leader of the affirmative party.
He is never on the defensive. He never stands pat.
When the country boiled over about the corruption
lof the old parties and the need for internal reform,
Roosevelt raised insurgency from a number of local
revolts to the plane of national politics. When for
eign affairs overwhelmed everything else, Roosevelt,
was the first man to lay his finger on the weakness
of Wilson, the first man to express unmistakably the
radical temper of the American people.
This is his genius, and it is a very high kind of genitia. lie in
neither a pioneer nor I creator, but he is a statesman i^ almost in
fallible instinct when it comes to judging the needs of the nation six
or eight months ahead.
This instinct goes hand in hand with another quality of the
born leader of men. Hoosevclt always attracts to himself, and knows
how to use the specialists who can help him. He is the only man,
for example, who ever succeeded in making a public servant out of
Taft or Root. Before the campaign Is over he will have Barnes and
Penrose singing "Tiie Star Spangled Banner," every morning be
fore breakfast.
Someone lias -mil of biiii that when he In in office "he
creates tbe ut Unisphere in which good things can lie done." He
knows how to make room in the govei imiiiit service for men
like (illford i'incliot.
He knows haw to call on till sorts of men for all sort* of
things. The administrative departments were raised hy ll r
veil to a really high pitch of efficiency. He not only knew how
to find men, he knew how to send that thrill of eagerness
which we call morale throughout nil bis administration.
And in the matter of foreign relations, ho knew what he waß
doing as few men have over known in our history.
He could foresee trouble, he could dramatize his opponents, and
when he acted it was always with that decision and accuracy which
makes the other man feci that every word counted.
In a political campaign Koosevelt is a loose talker. But in his
dealings with foreign powers he used precise language. He know
how to take advantage of every factor, how to persuade and thresten,
defy and flatter.
He is probably the most skillful American who ever played tbe
diplomatic game. You may not like that game. But if It le that
game which you want played, there is no one in the I'nited State*
who known It so well.
Because he can play it so well, lie is never patient when
anybody else is playing it.
He has the disgust which an engineer feels when he see*
some duffer bungling over a delicate machine. And he ex
presses this disgust with no reservations. He ui.il.es no place .
(or charity, has im tenderness for the duffer. He will fight like
all the furies to oust him.
Tomorrow: Justice Hughes.

MY WORD!
Bring On Your Encyclopedia If
You'd Read Col. Joab's Speech
Col. Albert E. Joab making the
opening address to the Jury today
in the case agHinst Paul llaffer,
charged with libeling the memorj
of George Washington, spent his
entire vocabulary in a vitupera
tive denouncement of (he defend
ant and a eulogy of the "Father
of our country."
The colonel opened by reading
the article written by llaffer. He
then proceeded to pick each sen
tence and word lo pieces.
What Got Hie Col.
"He called the noble, loving,
trust I n j.. gracious Washington a
drunkard," the colonel stormed.
"That Is not so bad. I could for
get that, but there is one pan
which struck me with righteous
indignation, and that was the
word 'blasphemou*.'
"Imagine saying that about the
man who was "first in peace, first
In war, and first In the heurts of
his countrymen.' Imagine this
mental weakling libeling the man
whom Chief Justice Marshall said
was our greatest citizen.
Orator's Voice Hbakes.
He ends his article with the
suiti'iuent that It was not writ
ten to libel Washington, but to re
move the custom of hero worship
from | few mindless people.
"Imagine calling Daniel Web
ster, Benjamin Franklin, Chief
Marshall and others, mindless
people.
"He wrote tills only four day*
after the anniversary of the
death of the Immortal Lincoln and
six days before the anniversary of
the mighty Washington."
Col. Joab's voice shook as he
uttered these words, so much was
he worked into the spirit of bis
talk.
"Mental Cripple."
"Imagine a mental cripple like
ibis llaffer," continued the col
onel, "dragging forth the mem
ory of the man who starved and
forze at Valley Forge; the man
who struggled through seven
years to give us our independ
ence, to drag it in the slime and
dust.
"When I think of llaffer, 1
think of John Wilkes Booth who
shot and killed Abraham Lincoln
In Ford's theater in Washington;
I. think of Charles Gulteau who
assassinated Garfield; I think of
Louis f/.olgosz who killed the
great McKlnley while addressing

Waves 1., ilit ;il.
Attorneys for the defense ob
jected here, claiming llaffer was
not charged with murder.
"When I look st that men
tal devgeiienite, do I think of
the beautiful lurk, or the
busy .mi or the energetic
bet-, sipping the honey from
the flower?" continued the
Col. "No. I think of a
lower iinliiutl. I think of the
buzzard. I (hlnk of the
sniped livi n.i. which skulks
onto the field of battle and
eats the maggot -covered
lii til j of the dead.
"That slimy ghoul who has en
tered the sacred tomb and stolen
the parts of the dead body of tbe
loved Washington, to bring them
forth and cast vile reflections
over the bone* to poison the
minds of his fellow men!
Here's a Good One.

TRAITOR, BIT THE THAI
TORS WERE NOT SO LOW AS
THIS. NO, NOT SO LOW.
In commenting on the articles
submitted by the defense as
proof for Haffer's statements,
Col. Joab referred to them as the
collections of dirty wharf rats,
who went to the sewer—the news
papers—and after gathering their
clippings, published them in book
form.
"And some other criminal," he
exploded, "will take Haffer's arti
cle and publish it and it will go
down In history to stain some
future generation.
Quotes I ..ii in. 100.
"In closing, the colonel quoted
the Latin for the following: "Let
justice be done though the heav
ens fall." He urged the Jury to
remember these word*. Another
quotation which befitted the case,
according to the colonel, was the
famous wonts of Homer, which he
gave with much feeling, "To lash
the great and monarrhe to revile."
"1 think of these word*, when
1 think of this stripling with the
deformed mind," sighed Joab.
It Adjective* In suing.
The general referred to by tha
colonel who did Agamennon and
his iiosis wrong on the bridge
just outside of tin; metropolis of
Troy sounded something like
Thiirpsyche, but courthouse at
taches were divided in opinions aa
to the correct spelling.
One chronicler of the trial
listed 14 adjectives which Joab
applied to Washington In one
phrase.
It is expected the defense will
give a brief talk when the colonel
has finished.
