war on the cattle tick, and yester
day Dr. Fisher of this city, who has
charge of Carter and Love counties

County Commissioners to discuss
plans for this work. It was finally
decided to defer final action until
the next regular meeting of the
board, as in the meantime many dip
ping tanks that are now in contem
plation will be completed, and the
department will be in a better posi
tion to combat the evil.
Most of the cattlemen of this sec-;
tion have declared that they will j
have necessary tanks constructed, i
and are working heartily with the .
department for the eradication of the.
tick evil. R. F. Scivally met witlij
the commissioners, and stated that
he already had one tank completed
and would have another before th
board convened again. When this
is done, Dr. Fisher will co-operate
with them and render all necessary
advice and instruction.
At the next meeting, the board will
appoint inspectors for the various
districts, and a systematic campaign;
begun for the eradication of the
cattle tick. Dr. Fisher states that,
he is meeting with great encourage
ment from the cattlemen of this ser-
tion, and hopi a the warfare on the '
tick will be so successful that it will
be eliminated.

CONGRESSMAN CARTER FILES
CONFERENCE REPORT, WHICH
HAS BEEN ADOPTED SENDS
MESSAGE.
The following telegram was receiv
ed today by The Ardmoreite from
Congressman Carter:
"I understand rumor is being cir
culated that the per capita payment
has been reduced. It is a mistake.
The conferees have agreed and I
have Just filed the conference re
port. The item of $300 to the Choc
taws and $200 to the Chlckasaws, as
passed by the house, has not been
changed. The payment of the money
to the individual Indians should be
begun during the first days of July."
The people generally, and the In
dians especially, will be pleased to
know that the conference report has
been adopted and that there is no
hitch or delay of any kind with ref
erence to the per capita payment
amendment to the Indian appropria
tion bill. As a result of the activity
and good work of Congressman Car
ter several millions of dollars will
he distributed among the Chlckasaws
and Choctaws this summer. Mr. Car
ter thinks the money will be paid
out during the month of July.
A family of five Chickasaws will
receive $1,000, and a family of Choc
taws of the same size will receive
$l,r00. it means much to the com
mercial life of the two nations to re
ceive this sum of money, and one of
the results will be better homes and
better equipment on the farms of
the Indians.
For the reason that the Chicka
saws received a payment last year
of $100 and the Choctaws did not
receive any funds, the payment to
the Choctaws is larger this year. The
two tribes share equally in the distri
bution of the tribal funds in the
hands of the government.

R. F. SCIVALLY BELIEVES IN PRO
GRESSIS PUTTING THEORIES
INTO PRACTICE AT SPRINGER
RANCH.
R. F. Scivally, who is one of the
most progressive farmers and cattle
men in this section of the state, has
recently completed a deal for some
pasture land in the Arbucklo moun
tains adjoining his property, that
brings his landed holdings up to
twenty-five and one-half sections.
Seven hundred acres of this land
Is in cultivation, and Is considered
the finest in this section. He has
his ranch equipped with all modern
machinery, and water from a never
failing spring is piped to his feeding
pens, barns and houses. He has
built several miles of macadam road
over his place, and at present owns
four of the most modern Bilos in
ihe county.
Mr. Scivally is a believer in high
grade cattle, and owns approximate
ly 300 head of registered stock, Here
fords and Durhams, besides a large
number of high-grade mules and
work horses, although horses and
mules for work on his ranch arr
gradually being supplanted by the
modern tractor.
ISesides his own cattle, Mr. Scivally
pastures a large number for Fort
Worth cattlemen, and stock from his
range is said to be In constant de
mand at the Fort Worth stockyards.
Mr. Scivally is a firm believer la
the dipping tanks for the eradication
of the cattle tick, and through his
efforts with the state board of agri
culture much of the success of the
recent orders of that body Is due.
Mr. Scivally contemplates many im
provements on his property in. tfc9
future, and when finished, he will
have one of the best equipped ranch
es in the southern portion of th'i
state.
A want ad will, sell that property
you no longer Deed at small cost.
