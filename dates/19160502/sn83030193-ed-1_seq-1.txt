Elevator at No. 60 Wall
Street.
An elevator In the skyscraper No.
SO Wall Street was stopped by
Charles Woodruff, the oporator, at
the eleventh floor to-day In obcdlenco
to a call uttered just after It left the
main floor. None of the three per
sons In the car, Miss Josephine Quirk,
Miss Van Houten or Charles Calla
han, moved to alight. Woodruff
started the car nnd sprang the catch
to clo'o the stcol half doors.
As the doors moved toward each
other Miss Quirk, a slender girl of
nineteen, who had been employed as
a stenographer slnco April 4 by the
Kast Asiatic Company, Ltd., on tho
eleventh floor, cried "Walt!" nnd
sprang through the narrowing open
ing. The onr was two feet, or more,
above the floor level. Her foot cnught
ns she Jumped out nnd she swung
head downward Into tho shaft, be.
fore It loosened. She uttered one
frightened set earn which startled
everybody In the building and plunged
to tho bottom of tho shaft.
Miss Quirk was dead when tho
floor men on the ground floor renched
her. The hall was soon packed with
excited tenants of tho building and
persons who had run In from outside.
Christian Larson, an employee of
the Kusttrn Asiatic Company, Identi
fied the body as that of Miss Quirk.
He snld little was known of her in the
omce except that she lived with her
family at No-. 927 Sixth Avenue, and
In the short term of her employment
had proved herself a model of prompt
ness and etllcicncy.
Woodruff, the elevator man, was
held by the policemen ns n material

Coroner.
An ordlnnnco forbidding the starting
of an elevator nt any floor until tho
