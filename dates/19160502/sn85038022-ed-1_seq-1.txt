THE HOME DT QUALITY CLOTHES
"7i the Sjmng a Young Jian'ts Fawy Lightly Turns to Thoughts of Clothes"
Your Boy Now Needs a New Suit
Would you have him well-dressed? In clothes that present a handsome ap
pearance and still resist the onslaughter of the youthful energy and vigor, that have
ripless seams and buttons that stay on?
"HECHINGER'S CLOTHES" FOR BOYS are the Ultimate in apparel
I that satisfies. The wear is guaranteed. SUITS $5.00 to $12.00.
With every Boy's Suit sold we give a handsome ball or bat.
SUITS AND COATS
The best we have ever had at their respective prices. This should be understood and expected. It
is a poor business indeed which cannot show improvement from year to year. Contrary to many prophecies
these new suits and coats, although different (and we think better) in style, are not freakish. Lack of dyes
has not as yet resulted in a meagre assortment of colors. Nor have we found it necessary to advance prices.
We are confident you will be pleased with an inspection of them. Coats $5.00 to $17.50. Suits $15.00 to
$35.00.
Woman's Underwear Section is Busy
