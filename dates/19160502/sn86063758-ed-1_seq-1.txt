Meeting of Warehouse Association in
Columbia Wednesday Will Be i
Important Gathering. . 1
'An interesting announcement, addressed
"to "whom it may concern"
was isseud by Senator Jno. L. McLaurin,
State Warehouse Commissioner,
in connection with the insurance
situation on Sunday. The statement
follows:
I "1T0 Wliom it May Concern:
"Any insurer of South Carolina. . *
who is unable to procure sufficient
| insurance through the regular chan- ^
nels may be benefited by calling on j
: me at my office in the building occupied
by the State warehouse commission,
corner Gervais and Pulaski
I streets, Columbia, S. C."
Last week a call was issued by Senator
J. A. Banks, president . of the
State Warehouse" association, for a
meeting of the association, to be lield
in the offices of the State warehouse
i commission )n (Wednesday afternoon .
at 2:30 o'clock. There lias been a
great deal of speculation in regard to
the meeting, and the statement o?
'Senator McLaurin, coming shortly on
the heels of the call, lends further Interest.
The State association is composed
of the managers of the various local
warehouses in the State system, num-bering
between 150 and 200f scattered
j throughout the 'various counties of
South Carolina, and those who have
* . t
been interested and instrumental in
the development of the system.

by the annoucements which

"Be it resolved by the Democrats
of Xewberrv county, in convention

assembled, that we endorse the candidacy
of Woodrow Wilson for re-nomination
by the National Democratic
convention, for the office of president
of the United States."
In speaking upon . the resolution,
Mr. Fred. H. Dominick, president of
the convention, took occasion to state
his position fully, in view of reports
which he said had gained currency
since his remarks at the Ward 2 club
meeting. President Dominick said:
Loyal to Democracy.
"Before putting the question, if the
convention will permit me, the chair
would like to add just one word here
at this time. On the night that my
ward club met her6 in this court
'house, there was introduced a resolution
of endorsement of Mr. iWilaon
and his administration, which I was
forced to decline to support, in the
language in which it was couched.

actions on that occasion have teen
