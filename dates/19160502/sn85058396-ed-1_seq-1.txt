IRISH REBELS
TO BE TRIED
Party of 489 Prisoners of All
Ranks Are Taken to
England.
MEN WERE MISLED
Were Not Informed of Plans of
Leaders Until After Arrival
in Dublin.
Dublin, May 1, via London, May
2, 10:05 a. m. "We were not led
badly, we were misled," said a cap
tured rebel officer last nlghL His
remark, uttered almost in a tone of
remorse at having participated in the
Sinn Fein revolt, was made as he
was stepping aboard a steamer at
Northwall quay to be taken to Eng
land. He was one -of the party of 4S9
prisoners of all ranks who were cap
tured Sunday.
Tho military authorities decided to
send the prisoners to England for
trial in order that they may be away '
from the prejudice and nnger of per
sons of the places -where they re
volted. When the correspondent, who
was permitted to go aboard the ves
sel, interrogated the prisoners, he
gathered they had no idea when they
were orderd to asBmblc various cen
ters on last Monday that tho leaders
hnd ordained that day for the declara
tion of the Irish republic. They
reached the meeting places with ra
tions for only eight hours in the be
lief that they were merely lo carry
out practice maneuvers, as they had
done on other occasions.
Rebels Given Strict Orders.
"We found large supplies of am
munition piled at the meeting
placeB," said one of tho prisoners,
"and received strict orders to defend
our positions. Wo were told it would ,
be necessary to hold out until May 2,
when foreign troops would land and
join us in fighting the British."
The prisoners included representa
tives of all parts of Ireland. For the
most part they were men of good phy-'
sical condition.
Uniforms Like British.
The uniforms of the officers were
so like those of the British army that
In the darkness It was difficult to dis
tinguish them. Two of the prisoners,
who were dressed as men, undoubted
ly were women. Most of the men
seemed nearly exhausted.
As the column marched through the
city many persons gathered at win
dows. There were a few cheers and
some waving of handkerchiefs. One
of the spectators remarked:
I "Why shouldn't we cheer them,
even if they have done a crazy thing?
They have been brave and they are
our own flesh and blood."
COMPULSORY BILL
TO BE INTRODUCED
Measure to Be Placed Tomor
row Before British House of
Commons.
London, May 2, 3 41 p. m Premier
Asquith declared In the house of com
mons this afternoon that a bill to b
introduced tomorrow would be one of
general and Immediate compulsion.
Mr. Asquith told the members of
the house of commons that the total
naval and military effort of the Brit
ish empire, since the beginning of
the war, exceeded five million men.
Eighty Three Divisions.
Premier Asquithsaid jthe. British
army, excluding India and ' including
the dominions comprised eighty-three
divisions.
The prime minister announced that
tho whole recruiting problem would
be dealt with in a single bill.
Mb. Asquitjh said that, while in
August 1914, the British army at home
and overseas consisted of twenty-six
rliviaJnnn tlioro wprn now covnn tv.nno
divisions, including the naval divis
ion. British Surrender Deplored.
In addressing the house of commons
Premier Asquith said the public was
naturally depressed by the deplorable
Incident of the surrender of the garri
son at Kut-el-Amara, but that it was
not an5 event of military importance.
Referring to tho attacks on the
government in this and other connec
tions, ho invited the house to turn to
speeches delivered during previous
crisis in the history of the country.
It would be found that charges of ex
actly the same nature were made.
There had been the same accusations
of indecision, procrastination, half
heartedness and delay and exactly
the same cry for a savior, or a com
bination of saviors. At one moment
the people were told that the civilians
in the cabinet as quite wrongly In
the case of some-had overruled their
military and naval experts. At an
other moment as he . believed they
would be told in regard to Mesopo
tamia It was said the civilians in the
cabinet were too subservient to their
military advisors.
Controbutlons Grow Steadily.
"My answer to all this" Mr. Asquith
said, ls that if there nave been mis
takes or blunders, perhaps both, In
policy or strategy, our contribution
the contribution of the United King
dom and the empire to the common
cause has grown and is growing
steadily month by month, and is great
er at this moment and better directed
than ever before. And the naval and
military situations of the allies has
never been so good as It Is today.
"We have to put up with these
things," tho premier said. He added
that the government would not be
disturbed by them as long as it re
tained the confidence of tho country.

SOLDIERS ARE
SEARCHING CITY
Will Account for Last of Snip
ers in Dublin Few Rebels
Still Holding Out
Dublin, May 2, 12:02 a. m via
London, 10:45 a, m. Soldiers are
completing a thorough search of the
city and it Is hoped that within a few
hours they will account for tho last of
the snippers, a small bands of rebels
which has been causing a disturb
ance in the neighborhood of Ball's
bridge. This band was subjected to
artillery fire Monday afternoon. A
few of the rebels are holding out.
Train communication is still inter
rupted. Quiet In Dublin.
Dublin. May 1, via London, May 2,
10 a, m. Quiet reigned in Dublin to
day. There was little traffic and the
thoroughfares were still strongly held
by the military forces0 of the govern
ment. Only a few sniping shots were
heard Sunday night. It is assumed
that the Sinn Feiners still at liberty
have hidden their arms after UBing
all their ammunition and rejoined the
ranks of peaceable citizens.
Food Shortage Cause Distress.
A shortage o ffood has caused much
distress but with the resumption of
almost normal conditions the commit
tee charged with looking after the
.needs of the population expects to re
lieve those in want within a very
short time.
It is still impossible to get from
one part of Dublin to another without
a military permit. No one is allow
ed to pass the bridges and merchants
residing in the suburbs are in most
cases ignorant of what has happened
to their shops, factories and ware
houses in the city.
Irish Situation Improving.
Dublin, Monday, May 1. Via Lon
don, May 2, 12:35 p. m. While the
situation outside Dublin is not as
satisfactory today aB in the city itself,
it is improving and the authorities ex
pect that a few days should see the
tlas of the armed, rebellion in Ireland.
A flickes still is apparent not far
from Dublin where a small group of
adherents of James Larkin have en
sconced themselves.
Further west of the capital there
are still bands of insurgents. The re
bels are skeptical of the assurances
given them that their comrades in
Dublin have surrendered. As the re
sult of the prompt measures by the
authorities, a mobile force is moving
into the mountains today, preventing
the Sinn FIners from assembling and
arresting their leaders. ,

Laredo Tex., May 2. The war department has instruct- B
ed the commander at Fort Mcintosh here to stop all shipments H

by the local military. IH
Washington, May 2. Generals
Scott and Funston at the Mexican
border today had further instructions
from Secretary Baker on which it is
expected they would resume negotia
tions with General Obregon, Carran
za's war ministers. These orders do
not alter the administration's attitude
toward maintenance of troops in
Mexican territory, it is assured.
Although no formal demand has
been made by representatives of the
de facto government for the with
drawal of American troops' Eliseo
Arredondo, Mexican ambassador des
ignate, in discussion with administration-
officials liere is laying' -emphasis
on the declaration that longer occupa
tion by American troops is reducing
the de facto government's authority.
Scott and Funston Meet Obregon.
El Paso, May 2. Major Generals
Scott and Funston held an extended
conference today over the amplified
instructions sent them from Washing
ton in which the administration siateu
that no agreement was to be reached
that waB based on any proposition for
the immediate withdrawal of the
American troops from Mexico. Word
was then dispatched to General Obre
gon, minister of war of the de facto
government, and his assistants, ask
ing for a second conference to discuss
the military questions now involving
the two republics. This conference
will probably be held this afternoon
in El Paso and there were indications
early today that it would be the last
one. The Mexican conferees, having
become acquainted with the adminis
tration's position on withdrawal
through press dispatches showed their
disappointment and there were Intima
tions that they might not further pur
'sue their request for withdrawal A
Mexican conferee said today that even
though the request was not met at
this conference there was no reason
to fear that serious trouble between
the two countries would follow.
Mexicans Want Withdrawal.
"The whole question of withdrawal
of the troops" said the Carranza offi
cial, "will then revert to Washington
for further negotiations between the
state department and Mr Arredondo,
the Mexican ambassador. At the con
ference hero we have given reasons
from a military standpoint why the
American soldiers should retire to
their own territory, and this informa
tion should be valuable In a future
determination of the question now
before tho state department I can
see no cause for any apprehension
over the future."
Obregon Against Co-Operation.
Tho American generals were ready
today to submit detailed planB for co
operation between the Carranza and
American forces in the pursuit of Vil

that General Obregon would suggest
that ho did not feel disposed to dis

diplomatic Issues, but would acquaint
