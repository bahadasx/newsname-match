men went out. reducing the amount of
i freight handled in the harbor by onej
half
| Notwithstanding: the prospect of an
I early settlement of the tugboat engineers*
strike, but few of the craft were observable
in the harbor today. As a result a
huge fle**t of tramp steamers and sailing
vessels entering port were forced to
remain at anchor in the lower bay while
outgoing freight collected and 'logged the
already overburdened piers. The transAtlantic
liners were forced to the dangerous
necessity of docking under their
own steam.
Demurrage Cost S2.000 a Day.
Shipping men assert that the loss in demurrage
on account of the delayed freight
will reach as high as $2,00ft a day. Many
vessels unable to reach their piers are
munitions carriers for the entente allies.

J It was announced that the strike of

ET, r.\SO. Tex., May 2 ? MaJ. Ctens
Scott and Funston held an extended
conference today over amplified instructions
sent them from Washington
in which the admfrustration stated that
j no agreement was to he reached that
j was based on the immediate with'
drawal of the American troops from
' Mexico.
Word was then dispatched t.o (Jen.
i Obregon, minister of war of the de
j facto government, and his associates,
I asking for a second conference to discuss
the military questions now involving
the two republics.
This conference will probably be held
thi* afternoon in Rl Paso and there were
[indications that it would be the last
one. The Mexican conferees, having
become acquainted through press dispatches
with the administration's position
on withdrawal, showed their disappointment.
There were intimation?
that they might not further pursue
their request for withdrawal. A Mexican
conferee said that even though the
request was not met at this conference
I there was no reason to fear that serious
trouble between the two countries'
j would follow.
Diplomats May Settle Question.
"The whole question of withdrawing
the troops." said the < 'arranza official,
"will then revert to Washington for
fnt 11 r#? negotiations between the State
Department arid .Mr-. Arredondo, the
Mexican ambassador. At the conference
here we have Riven reasons
from a military standpoint why the
American soldiers should retire to their
ovn u territory and this information
should be valuable in a future determination
of the question now before
the Stale Department. 1 can see no
cause for any apprehension over the
future."
The American generals were ready
today to submit detailed plans for cooperation
between the <'arranza and
American forces in the pursuit of Villa
and his bandits, but it is understood
that tier, obregon would suggest that
he did not feel disposed to discuss that
proposal, because of certain diplomatic
phases, but would acquaint the first
chief w ith the question.
Should the minister of war take this
position regarding the question of cooperation
it was thought that the con|
Terence would then be ended and both
sides would make their reports to their
respective governments, fieri. Funston
believes the American army is prepared
to meet any eventuality.
Rains Hamper Supply Trains.
COLUMBUS. X. M., May 2.?Heavy
rains falling over northern Chihuahua
confronted American military authorities
with a new problem in the transportation
of supplies to the Mexican
front. Operation of the motor truck
supply line was interrupted because ol
the inability of five trains to make
their way from Colonia Dublan, 120
! miles south of the border, over the
| soapy mud of the rutted roads.
| The reports here said three of the
trains are at Ascencion arid two at
Dublan.
The rains, according to old residents,
are but the beginning of the tropical wet
season, which usually continues in this
uoflinti ffir aViniit t \*rr? rrir.nt>iK
A large detachment of infantry which
was being prepared here to cross the
border will not march today. It was said.
However, the men have been partly
equipped and it is believed they will be
sent shortly to strengthen Gen. J. J.
Pershing's shortened line of communication.
Operations in the field continued at a
practical standstill today, so far as was
learned here, all interest being centered
on the conference in El Paso.
Additional Instructions
Sent by War Department
to Conferees at El Paso
Gens. Scott and Funston at the Mexican
border today had further Instructions
from Secretary Baker on which
I It was expected they would resume neI
gotlatlons with Gen. Obregon, Oarrani
za's war minister.
; These orders, telegraphed last night
do not alter the administration's attitude
toward maintenance of troops ir
Mexican territory, it is declared. Th<;
precise nature of the messages was noi
disclosed by officials.
They were prepared by Secretary
Baker after conference with President
Wilson and Secretary I^ansing in response
to inquiries from (Jen. Scot!
concerning the administration's attitude.
After today's cabinet meeting
officials reiterated there was no change
in the plan of the Pnited States government
to keep the troops in Mexicc
until the bandits were completely dispersed.
Although no formal demand has beer
j made by representatives of the de facte
j government for the immediate withdrawal
of American troops, Eliseo Ar!
redondo, Mexican ambassador desig!
nate. in discussion with administratioi;
! officials here, is laying emphasis on th?
! declaration that longer occupation by
j American troops is reducing the #1#
j facto government's authority and may
i lead to serious trouble.
Mr. Arredondo's Statement.
Mr. Arredondo indicated the feeling
' of his government that the Americar
expedition already has accomplished
its real purpose?the elimination oi
Villa and his adherents?and that long
1 er occupation of Mexican territory bj
' American troops was serving only t<

"We are satisfied that Villa bandit:

SNOWDEN MARSHALL
MAY BE EXONERATED
Impeachment Charges Against Unit- j

May Lapse.
There are indications that the im- [
peachinent charges against H. Snow- i
nen aiarsnaii, ? niteo ?iates aistrict at- i
torney at New York, together with the I
contempt issue raised against him by j
the House judiciary subcommittee, may j
lapse.
The Judiciary committee has the im- !
peaehment charges still under consid- j
eration, and Representative Moon of
Tennessee, chairman of the special
committee which investigated the ques- !
tion of contempt of the House growing !
out of letters he wrote criticising the j
committee, is not ready yet to call up j
his committee's report, which upheld j
the charge of contempt.
The plan, it was stated today, is to
defer calling up the contempt case until
after the judiciary committee's report
rn the impeachment charges,
whlcr. were preferred by Representative
Buchanan of Illinois. The judiciary
committee expects to report within a
week or two.
It was said today that the committee
probably would exonerate Mr. Marshall,
so far as impeachment is concerned, for j
want of sufficient evidence to make a j
case, though possibly suggesting some j
sort of censure.

"When the food ship failed to reach
Kut," the dispatch adds, "Gen. Townshend

U. S. FORCE AT DOUGLAS
GROWING MORE ALERT
DOUGLAS. Ariz.. May 2.?Increased
alertness on the part of the American
soldiers stationed here is noticeable,
and apparently has resulted in increased
apprehension on the part of the
public.
A police regulation against street
gatherings of any kind which might
result in friction between Mexicans and
Americans is in effect today. For the [
first time in many weeks the provost j
guard on duty in the main part of'
Douglas appears armed with rifles in ,
addition to the pistols and clubs they
usually carry. The border patrol is re- .
ported to have been doubled. This. It
is stated, is merely a precautionary'
measure and was not the result of defl- {
nite developments. i

pleting ?i thorough search of the
city, and it is hoped that within
a few hours they will account for
the last of the snipers, a small
hand of rebels which lias been
causing a diversion in the neighborhood
of Balls Bridge.
This hand was subjected to artillery
fire Monday afternoon. A
few of the rebels are holding out.
Train communication is still interrupted.
Says Rebels Were Misled.
"We were not led badly, we were misled."
said a captured rebel officer. Hii
remark, uttered almost in a tone of remorse
at having participated in the Sinn
Fein revolt, was made as he was stepping
aboard a steamer at North Wall quay, to
he taken to England. He was one of the
party of 489 prisoners of all ranks who
were captured Sunday.
The military authorities decided to send
the prisoners to England for trial, in
order that they may be away from the
prejudice and anger of persons of the
places where they revolted, killing civilians
and soldiers. When the correspondent
who was permitted to go aboard the
vessel interrogated the prisoners he
gathered they had no idea when they
were ordered to assemble at various
centers Easter Monday that the leaders
had ordained that day for the declaration
of the Irish republic. They reached
the meeting places wnn rations iur
eight hours, in the belief that they were
merely to carry out practice maneuver?,
as they had done on other occasions.
Told to Defend Positions.
"We found large supplies of ammunition
piled at the meeting placet."
said one of the prisoners, "and received
strict orders to defend our positions.
We were told it would he
necessary to hold out only to Mav 2.
when foreign troops would land and
join us in fighting the British."
The prisoners included representatives
of all parts of Ireland. For the
most part they were men of good
physique. The uniforms of the officers
were so like those of the British
army that in the darkness it was difficult
to distinguish them. Two of the
prisoners, who were dressed as men.
undoubtedly were women. Most of the
men were fatigued almost to the
point of exhaustion. They were provided
with the same rations as the
troops escorting them.
As the column marched through th?*
city from Richmond barracks to the
quay many persons gathered at windows.
There were a few cheers and
some waving or nanoKercnieis. vue
of the Spectators, who seemed to vote*'
the feelings of many others, remarked
"Why shouldn't we cheer them, even if
rhey have done a crazy thing? They
have been brave and they are our own
tlesh and blood."
Countess' Surrender Dramatic.
The Countess of Markieviez, who
commanded a force of 320 rebels in the
Royal College of Surgeons, surrender'u
in a dramatic fashion. A white flag
was hoisted Saturday morning and a
communication sent to the officer commanding
the attacking force saying
.hat the rebels would surrender at 11
o'clock.
At the appointed hour the countess
marched out of the college, followed
doselv bv the rebels walking in twos.

BELFAST. Monday, May 1. via Honion.
May 2, 1 p.m.?One of the most
ragic affairs of the rebellion was the
Lmbushing of a party of police in County
