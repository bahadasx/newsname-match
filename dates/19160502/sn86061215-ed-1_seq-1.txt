Mexican Leader Has Not
Made Definite Demand
That Troops Leave
CONTENTS HIMSELF
WITH SUGGESTION
Conferences Between Scott
and Carranza Military
Chief to Continue
El Pate, Texas., May 1. —Major
Gen. Frederick Funston announc
ed shortly before noon today that
only one more conference would be
held with the Mexican representa
tives on the military questions now
existing between this country and
Mexico. He said It would be a
brief one. Generals Scott and
Funston are awaiting a reply from
Washington before setting a time
for the conference*.
Washington, D. C., May 1.—Addi
tional instructions sent to Gen. Scott
and Gen. Funston today by Secretary
Baker after conference with president
"Wilson and with Secretary Lansing
are understood to make plain that
whatever is agreed upon at the con
ference with Gen. Ohregon, Gen. Car
ranza's minister of war, must not be
based on any Immediate recall of Gen.
Pershing's forces.
Gen. Scott probably will point out
to the Carranza war minister that the
de facto government is threatened by
factional enemies within its own bor
ders who would welcome an oppor
tunity to rise against it. If the Unit
ed States were compelled to gointo
Mexico in considerable force to make
certain the security of its own border
against bandit raids, that opportunity
might be prevented.
While no demands have been pre
sented by either side, it is understood,
however, that Gen. Obregon laid such
stress upon the withdrawal of the
American forces that Gen. Scott felt
unable to proceed until he had ad
vised the administration officials.
NEGOTIATIONS SATISFACTORY.
Washington, D. C., May 1. —After an
exchange of messages between Gen.
Scott and the war department on his
conference Saturday with Gen. Obre
gon, Mexican minister of war, officials
said today the negotiations up to date
have been "satisfactory." While Gen.
Obregon has urged that the American
troops be withdrawn, President Wilson
they said, has no intention of granting
the request at present and is hopeful
that an agreement will be reached for
cooperation between American and
Mexican troops in the pursuit of Villa,
and other bandits.
Final proposals have not yet been
reported In the border conferences, it
was authoritatively stated at the war
department. Along code dispatch from
Gen. Scott arrived early today. Secre
tary Baker of the war department ex
pected to send supplementary advices
to Gen. Scott, to reach him If possible
before his second conference with Gen.
Obregon.
While it was officially admitted that
Gen. Obregon had "suggested" with
drawal from Mexico of the U. S. expe
dition, officials said these overtures
had not been in the form of a demand
and that no peremptory or unalterable
position had been takep by either side.
Gen. Scott, it was explained, had made
counter suggestions to Gen. Obregon
proposing cooperative military meas
ures.
BAKER 8EES WILSON.
Secretary Baker took the dispatch
received this morning from Generals
Scott and Funston to the white house
and conferred with President Wilson.
Officials said the message asked for an
explanation of some of the pointB made
by Secretary Baker in previous instruc
tions. After his conference with the
president, Secretary Baker conferred
briefly with Counselor Polk of the
state department and then prepared
and forwarded additional instructions
to Gen Scott amplifying those sent
last night.
It is known Gen. Obregon suggested
withdrawal of the American expedition
ivithin a "reasonable time" and that
.he Mexican railways would be placed
at Gen. Pershing's disposal to expe
dite the retirement. He did not sug
gest any time limit for the American
forces to be out of Mexico and there
was nothing in what he said to indicate
an unfriendly spirit.
•G
Secretary Lansing said there had
been no change in the administration's
policy as to the pursuit of the bandits.
His appointment with Eliseo Arredon
do, the Mexican ambassador, later to
day was asked by the ambassador, who
did not disclose its purpose.
Confirmation of the removal of the
capital of Vera Cruz state to Orizaba
from the port of Vera Cruz reached the
state department today. No
explan­i'days
ation was given.

LESSONS LEARNED
OF GREAT VALUE
TROOPS IN ACTUAL SERVICE DEM
ONSTRATE THAT NEW EQUIP
MENT IS NEEDED.
Field headquarters, April 25.—By
courier to Columbus, N. M., May 1.—
Many practical Improvements in de
tails of campaigning and of service
equipment have been worked out or
suggested, in the five weeks' chase of
Villa and his bandits.
More varied wireless equipment is
one change.
The art of cooking in the field made
advanoes which demonstrated the ad
visability of the addition of some sort
of a frying pan to the mess kits of
the men. The men have been thrown
upon their own resources for cooking
so often that probably every pian
who went to the front could now qual
ify for an assistant chef. Lacking fry
ing pans, they used their mess pans,
which have a .long htfndle, an adjust
ment feature especially bad for flip
ping eggs because the pan usually
flipped too.
A pack mule kitchen is the most
important improvement suggested in
the cooking line. The mules can fol
low the cavalry anywhere and get
there before dark, assuring the men
of a meal properly cooked by compe
tent chefs.
The cavalry has proved that it is
second to none in the history of the
American army. It has marched more
than fifty miles a day at times,
through mountains where the trails
were unknown, through canyons which
the natives declared horsemen could
not penetrate, without regular rations,
and living on a little meal and hard
ground corn without salt.
The cavalry sabre has been useless
in this campaign. The cavalry rifle
has proved too long, suggesting a re
turn to the carbine which oscillates
less in the boot while packed on a
horse.
The necessity for some ready sys
tem of hobbling horses so that ^hey
could not stray Tyhile grazing on un
fenced" prairies was brought out
sharply. So alto was the desirability
of smaller horses, the low weight car
rying type about fifteen hands high,
Instead of the seventeen hand high
type of cavalry animals which can do
great Jumping and ring show work.
The. hunter type of animal, suitable
for park and hound riding, did not
prove as useful In this campaign as
the smaller native ponies of the west
and southwest, which were able to
Bhift for themselves and live on grass
when corn, oats or hay was low.
The old "iron ration" bacon, coffee
and hardtack, with a little sugar and
salt, stood every test of this campaign,
so far, keeping the men in remarkably
good health.
The only dress reform Indicated was
in shoes, for rough work in deserts
and mountains. Ordinary heavy
marching shoes wore out in a few
days frequently, In some cases, even
Op one day of mountain climbing. The
footgear which seems to have held
up better than shoes and legglns is the
high laced boat with heavy hobnails.
The practicability of automobile
trucks for carrying supplies through
mountains and over bad roads or
plains with no roads which was dem
onstrated by the Mexican chase, was
one of the most important campaign
discoveries. Gen. Pershing himself
said that the trucks climbed "like
mountain goats."
HARDSHIPS IN ICE
TURN MEN INSANE
Halifax, N. S., May 1.—The fate of
the captain and crew of the British
steamship Suffolk, caught in the ice
in the White sea while on her way to
Archangel shortly before Christmas,
with details of sufTerlng from cold,
hunger and exposure resulting in the
death of all but three men of a crew
of twenty-seven, and the suicide of the
ship's captain, who, maddened by
hunger and cold, shot himself, were
related here today by sailors of the
Newfoundalnd steamer Bellaventure,
just in from Archangel.
The crew of the Bellaventure, which
has been in Russian waters for more
than a year, met and talked with the
three survivors, only oi^e of whom, a
Russian Finn, was physically able to
recount his adventures. The other
two men were not expected to recover.
The Suffolk, supposedly having a car
go of war supplies, was caught in the
ice of the White sea with the first
heavy freeze before the holidays. Food
and fuel became exhausted. The
ji^v^
Buf­
fering caused many of the men to lose
their minds and while in this state
they succumbed.
When only ten survivors remained
they decided to try to reach land on
foot. Taking the scanty provisions re
maining they set forth on an eighty
'mile trip across the ice. A heavy
blizzard set in and the party soon be
came scattered and lost. Only three
were able to stick together and after
of wandering they were 'found
by the crew of a British ship and tak
en to land.

Rebel Leaders Surrender to
British Troops and Riot
in Du^in Ceases
GERMAN ATTACK AT
VERDUN REPULSED
Paris Claims That Many of
Foes Fell in Assaults
on Dead Man Hill
Dublin, Sunday evening April 30 (via
London, May 1.)—Rebels of the rank
and file followed the example of their
leaders this morning an'd. confessed the
cause of the Irish republic was lost by
laying down their arms at the foot of
the Parnell monument in Sackville
street and surrendering to British
troops. About 450 of them who had
fought since Monday in this central
area marched out from their strong
holds under the white flag and gave
themselves up. A few lrreooncilables
continued sniping from lairs, difficult
to locate, on roofs or among rafters of
buildings nearby.
Soon afterward a rebel lieutenant
came in with a guard of ten men from
the adjoining county of Meath to learn
the truth about rumors of a general
surrender. The party learned from J.
H. Pearce, who was named provisional
president of the Irish republic, that the
movement had collapsed. The lieuten
ant and his escort then started out to
parley with the rebels in the country
districts in an effort to induce them
to lay down their arms.
James Connolly, one of the leaders
of the uprising, is said by government
officials to be a prisoner, wounded, in
the castle.
WAR 8UMMARY.
The Germans have renewed their
aggressive In force northwest of Ver
dun, delivering amassed attack on the
positions recently captured by the
French north of "DeatMUfan MtMHd
counter attacking also a trench they
had lost north of Cumleres. In both
cases the assailants were repulsed,
Paris declares, their masses being
mowed down in large numbers in the
Dead Man hill assault.
Indications that further German ef
forts are Impending are furnished by
announcement that hill 30, west of the
Meuse, and positions in the Vaux sec
tor, northeast of Verdun, are being in
cessantly bombarded.
Unofficial advices from Constantin
ople say that the Turks estimate at
20,000 men the losses of the British
during March and April in Meso
potamia, where Gen. Townshend last
week was forced to surrender his be
leaguered army of some 10,000 men at
Kut-El-Amara on the Tigris.
SPY MUST_FflCE TRIAL
Alleged German Agent Ordered Re
turned to Great Britain Despite
His Contentions.
Washington, D. C., May 1.—The su
preme court held today that Ignatius
Timothy Trlbich Lincoln, former mem
ber of the British parliament and con
fessed spy, must go back to England
for trial on a charge of forgery.
Lincoln was arrested in New York
and made a sensational escape. He
was rearrested and from the order for
his extraditipn he sought release
through habeas corpus proceedings.
The New York federal district court
refused to release him and Lincoln
appealed to the supreme court which
today affirmed the lower court. Lin
coln contended that if returned to
England he would be tried as a spy
contrary to the extradition treaty be
tween the United States and Great
Britain that no one shall be extradited
for political offense.
NO WORD FROM GERMANY
Gerard at Headquarters of the Kaiser
While Reply to U. S. Ultimatum
Is Being Drawn.
Berlin, May 1.—At least another
day's deliberations at headquarters
may be expected before the German
answer to the American note is de
cided on. This is deduced from the
fact that Ambassador Gerard tele
graphed last night it was uncertain
when he would be able to return to
Berlin. Mr. Gerard is the guest of
Emperor William at meals.
BRITISH 8HIP SUNK.
London, May 1.—The British steam
ship Hendonhall, from Portland, April
7, and Loulsburg, ,C. B., April 11 for
Rotterdam, has been sunk, according
to a dispatch to Lloyds. The crew was

LIBOR TROUBLES
8TRIKE8 AND WALKOUTS AFFECT
THOU3ANDS OF WORKERS
THROUGHOUT EAST.
Chicago, May 1.—Excitement among
the strikers at the Blue Island avenue
plant of the International Harvester
Co., when It was announced that the
company Intended to bring in strike
breakers to operate the plant this
morning caused officials of the com
pany to ask the police for extra guards.
The police said they would have 100
patrolmen, fifty mounted police and a
number of plain clothes men at the
scene when the factory started opera
tions this morning to guard against
possible violence on the part of the
5,000 men out on strike.
Unfounded rumors circulated among
employes of the harvester company's
plant at Deerlng, on the west side, that
a number of Mexican strike breakers
were being taken to the plant early
last night and that two'companies of
the Illinois national guard had been
called out caused considerable excite
ment among the strikers. It was soon
learned, however, that the Mexicans
were employes of another industrial
plant and that the national guardsmen
were merely out on inspection. No
additional police have been asked for
the Deerlng plant
MARINE WORKERS QUIT.
New York, May 1.—Th/e marine traf
fic of this port was seriously affected

2,000 machinists employed at the vari
ous industrial plants of the city did not
report for work this mofnlng and a

PAPER IS
SUPPLY IS SNORT
NEW8PAPERS OF UNITED STATES
AND CANADA FACE MOST
8ERIOU8 PROBLEM.
The newspapers of the United
States and Canada are confronted
with the most serious situation in
their history. The Bupply of paper Is
now a great deal less than the de
mand. There is practically no reserve
stock and the papers are UBing more
white paper than is manufactured.
This condition was made known ten
days ago at a conference between the
mill owners and a number of the
newspaper publishers. This confer
ence was held for the purpose of find
ing out how many ,tons of print paper
the newspapers were consuming each
day, and how many tons of print pa
per the mills were producing. Pre
vious to this meeting It was not defi
nitely known what the consumption
and production of print paper amounts
to. The production of many of the
mills Is growing less each year, be
cause of the diminishing of wood sup
ply for pulp, and some of the print
paper millB being converted into mak
ing other kinds of paper, especially
wall paper. The shortage is further
decreasing by the fact that foreign
countries like Sweden and Norway
are not now producing any pulp for
sale'in this country. The millB in
those countries as well as in Canada
are hampered on account of the war.
Last week men from Europe and
South America were in New York of
fering fabulous prices for print paper.
While the price of course Is soaring,
the newspaper publishers are up
against the fact that it is not really
a matter of price but is a matter of
supply, or rather a lack of supply. Un
der those conditions it means that the
institution with the money that will
enable it to pay a fabulous price will
pay it That makes it that much hard
er on the business with the ordinary
Incoine.
Matrix paper that la used in stereo
typing is almost all made abroad. A
great deal of it is made In Germany
and is therefore hard to get. Large
shipments of it are now being held
at Rotterdam and other neutral porta.
Last week the American Newspaper
Publishers association in oonrentldn in
New York City, passed a resolution
asking the president of the United
States to request England to allow
these shipments of matrix paper to
be loaded and sent to this country.
This is the most serious matter that
the publishers have been confronted
with and the papers that are selling
for a penny a day and $3 a year by
mail are likely to be forced to raise
their price.
SIOUX CITY WANTS

Sioux City, May 1.—Councilman
George Ward of the public safety de

pared with the benefits derived. The
total Incomes from the railroads, Mr.
Ward said, was a little more than
$10,000 per annum.

Washington, D. C., May 1.—Anoth

possible was started today by demo
cratic leaders of both houses. The
aim is to get the more Important fea
tures of the pending slate enacted In
to law before the national political
conventions and in this the minority
in congress is expected to cooperate.
The calling up of the Philippine in
dependence bill under a special rule
providing for its disposition in one

"clean up'' campaign in the house.
With this bill disppsed of, it 1b plan

sular, shipping, fortifications, rural
credits, naval and revenue bills.
The senate steering committee
meets today to formulate a new legis

part in the "speed up" process. It is
planned to take up an appropriation
and defense measures as soon as they
are ready. Meanwhile, however, con

as well as other matters are awaiting
disposition.
