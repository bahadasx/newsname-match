Troops Prepare to Cross
. Columbus, N. M., May 2. Briga
dier General John J. Pereblna: Is con
centrating and disposing his force

mentarily Imminent. With the con
terence between Mexican and Amer
ican representatives hanging fire at
Et Paao, the altuatlon la admittedly
tena and he la taking no cbancea,
tt waa awerted, acting under actual
war conditlona. Every movement tn
the conference room la reported to
him by wireless.
Scattered American columns have
twn drawn Into an advanced baae,
and additional defensive worki con
structed at several points.
All troops at the Columbus baae
are held In readiness to move on
abort notice, If necessary. Four com
panies of Infantry are preparing to
inarch at an early hour. It Is be
lieved they received orders to cross
the border to reinforce advanced de
tachments. One machine gun -com
pany Is ilso under orders to leave to-
day.
A heavy delay In the transporta
tion of auppltea is now confronting
the authorities. One hundred and
thlrty-flve motor trueks. comprising
five trains, were sunk In deep mud
near Aecenslon and Dublan yesterday
and last night. The heavy rainfall
made quagmires of the trains. When
sunk In the morass the motors were
making rapid return trips, piling up
supplies at the front., If the heavy
rain continues It will probably bring
on a most serious situation.
A new 165-horaepower Curtlss
aeroplane made a test flight today.
With its great power It la expected
to pnMB the altitude test easily, and
will probably be sent at once to the
front.

. promising the Islands Independence
' within four years, and accepted aa a
substitute the Jones bill, which pro
vides for greater solf-government and
declares the United States Intends to
grant the Philippines independence
at some later date, which la not given.
Thirty democrats voted with the
.republicans In smashing the' Clarke
amendment, which had the support
of the president. This was the first
defeat of any administration measure
of any Importance this year.

department bolleve today that Gen

Obregon ran reach an agreement tor
better cooperation between Ameri
cana and Mextcana In the hunt for

sador Arredondo strongly desire
withdrawal of United States' troops
from Mexico, It is felt that they may
see tho logic of assisting the expedi

Is to continue. Concerning this point,
tho admlnlstdatlon left no doubt.
Baker has taken no steps to Indi
cate that he anticipated an unamlc
able outcome of the 131 Paso confer
ences. It this ia accomplished, the
conference will be considered success
ful. With the conclusion of the meet
ings Secretary Lansing will be In a
position to discuss with Arredondo
the question of the withdrawal of
American troops from Mexican soil.
Intervention advocatea at El Paso
are endeavoring to befog the atmos
phere there and Influence the opinions
and actions of the military authori
ties, Secretary Baker was Informed.
Whether this information came from
official sources waa not revealed, but
it apparently was offlclat. When
shown the border story that Inter
ventionists had Interviewed General
Hugh Scott, Baker said:
"You know Scott so well that there
Is no need for me to say anything
about that, particular phase. I have
heard rumors of Interventionist en
deavoring to spread information with
a view to influencing the situation,"
He made It plain that he had the
utmost confidence in Scott' ability
to handle the situation. ' ."

American representatives In the con
ference with General Alvaro Obre

from Washington today and General

patches and confirm statements that

vIbo Obregon that Washington re

deadlock.

Interventionists are still very busy
along the border, trying to bring
about a situation that will make In
tervention Inevitable. The general
belief here is that they will fall, un
less, some hothead among the Ameri
can or Mexican forces permits a clash
to occur which might be so Berious
aa to render peace impossible.
In the meantime, both the Mexi
can and American armies, are In
active. At some points along the
line taken by the American expedi
tion the forces are only a few miles
apart. No alarm 1. felt for General
PerBhing's command, as It has been
heavily -rointorced, strongly equip
. ped and provisioned to meet any situ
ation which may arise. There are
now 17,000 American soldiers in
Mexico, all except about 200 along
J the line from the border to Naml
jqulpa' protected by entrenched and
fortified camps. General Funston is
confident that the Americana could
hold ' out Indefinitely against much
larger forces of Mexicans and could
take the offensive If It were desirable,
