For two reasons, some prominent
persons in Australia go so far as to
say that the neutrality policy of the
United . States regarding, the Euro
pean war is best because, first, this
country Is an extremely valuable
j source of supplies for the Allies, and
secona, tor iijigiana 10 nave tne unit
ed States as & "friend in conH at the
wind-u of the? ahow" would be of
great importance;
These are the; impressions of Aus
tralian sentiment concerning the
United 'States brought back by Prof.
Herbert -JJ. Greorv. ereoloIt of the
U, 8. Geological' Hnrvey, and profes
sor of geology of Tale University, who
came to Honolulu this mornln from
Syrnev, on the Oceanic liner Sonoma.
"I have beeu In Australia since
January 1, and all the Intelligent, tvw
ple I met there, government officials,
lawyers, educators, " college men, in
fact, all but the laboring classes, were
quite for the United States neutralitv
policy although the labor men feel
auite bitter about it," said Professor
Oreeorr. ' :-
' "Some of the ' men with whom I
talked went so far as to. say that our
neutrality Is the fee8t thing that could
happen: for - Great Britain, because
we are sure of? a steary source o'
unplies. and they also feel it Is good
policy to have a friend in court at
the wind-up of the show. I was treat
ed with the greatest courtesy wher
ever I went? .

making studies of desert water-supply
systems in Australia, with a view to

"I will be In Hawaii for - three or
four weeks, said Professor, Gregory,
"and while hert I shall devote some
time to studying the big canyons on
Kauai, Waimea and Olokele, 1 believe
they vare named. I shall make a
study of the contrast in- topograph afforded-'
by Waimea canyon,-5, whire
both heavy and light rainfall sones are
close together" ,; : . '
Professor Gregory also intends r to
visit Kllauea volcano. Waimea can
you. which he will study, has; been
compared to the Yelowstone, because
of its peculiar formation and its won

their beauty and majesty. . - "
