mell, general manager of the Minne

ting a plan for the bridge over the

of the present Bemidji avenue outlet,
opened the discussion of the proposed

To Remove Tracks.
Mr Gemmell in his letter proposed
track changes on Bemidji avenue so
as to make the railroad crossing
there less dangerous. He proposed to
remove all except one track. The
steel tower and several light poles
would have to be removed and the
street would be placed on the same
level with the Minnesota & Inter
national bridge. Mr. Gemmell in his
letter stated that he believed that the
work would cost less than any other
project He stated that the railroad
could not consistently open Second
street for a street crossing as it would
so cut up their yards as to make them
valueless
Several of the aldermen stated that
they had received complaints from
farmers and others on account of
switching at the pressent crossing
frightening teams. It was pointed
out that it is dangerous for a woman
or a child to drive a team over the
crossing.
"The council had better resign if
the present location of the bridge
and the dangerous crossing is re
tained," said Alderman Bailey. "The
people won't stand for it."
