WASHINGTON. May 2. When

still waiting for the kaiser's reply on
the boat issue. As a result of
Ambassador Gerard's delay in return
ing to Berlin from the k&lser's head
quarters, the dispatch, expected from
the American ambassador yesterday,
is now not looked for before tomor

is no official light on the course of
Germany's proposed action.
^Unofficial dispatches from Berlin
say the second draft of the reply has
been completed. From all accounts
the note will be enroute to Washing

The fact that the conference be
tween Gerard and the kaiser was
more prolonged than at first planned,
is taken as a hopeful indication here.
United Press dispatches from Ber

response in administration circles
here. Today it is the general belief
that Germany will yield to the presi

but whether the German reply will
clear up all of the difficulties at once
or whether it will concede the presi

Conference of Mexican and
American Officials Comes

[By R. T. Oonkle, United Press Staff

HL« PASO, Texas, May 2.—What
may be the final conference between
Generals Scott, Funston and Obre
gon, Carranza secretary of war, is ex
pected to be held today if final in
structlons from Washington are re
celved by Scott and Fnnston In tim»'|
to notify the Mexican conferees.
When the conferees nteet. General
Scott will advise General Obregon

gon is expected to politely refuse to

General Obregon's statement that the

The date for the withdrawal of the!

and the Irish rebellion unqussttenstb
ly strengthened the hand of the gen
eral conscription advocates.
Whether a struggle will ansae in
parliament when the government MU
for the conscription of the married
men comes up for vtte cannot be
definitely predicted. Premier Asquith
and the military leaders explained
the situation fully at the recent sec
ret session of parliament. It is pos
sible that his explanauon removed
ground for opposition.
The Philippine Bill.
WASHINGTON, May 2.—Senate
leaders said today they probably
would approve the house Phfiipfpino
bill granting the Islands a lafger de
gree of self-government, but making
no definite promise of independence.
The senato favors independence at
an early date, but will accept, it is
said, the house measure as better
than nothing.
The independent section of the
senate measure, granting independ
ence In four years, was defeated last
night when thirty democrats led by
Fitzgerald and Conroy of New York,
Jolnod the republican minority. Presi
dent Wilson personally had urged tha
passage of the senate bill.
"I am not coming back to con
gress," said Mfinuel L. Quezon, Philip
pine delegate to congress today.
"What is the use? What -chance for
the independence of my country?
"What does America's declaration
that no man oughl to rule another
man amount to? If Abraham Jilneoln
were here tod^iy. he would be bewil
dered. He would have to be intro
duced to the republican side."
The general belief here is that they
will fall, unless hot heads among the
American or the Mexican army per
mit a clash to occur which will be so
serious as to render peace impossible.
In tho meantime, both the Mexican
and American armies are inactive. At
some points along the line taken by
the punitive expedition, the forces
are only a few miles apart. No alarm
is felt here for ?«neral Pershing's
force as he has been so reinforced,
equipped and provisioned as to meet
any situation which might arise.
There are now 17,000 American sol
diers In Mexico, all except about 200
along the 300 mile line from the bor
der to NTamiquipa and protected by
entrenched and fortified camps. Gen
eral Funston is confident that this
force could not only hold out indefi
nitely against a much larger force,
but could actually take the offensivo
if it was desired.
What are regarded as final Instruc
tions to the American conferees ar
rived today from Washington and
General Scott stated that the confer
ence would be he'd this afternoon.
The time and place will probably be
left to the convenience of the Mexi
can members of the conference. The
instructions to the American con
ferees follow outlines given In Wash
ington dispatches and confirms the
statements made that this conference
will have no power to decide the
future movement of U. S. troops in
Mexico and there will be no imme
diate withdrawal.
General Scott stated at 10 o'clock
that arrangements for the afternoon
conference had not yet been com
pleted, but that the request of Mexi
can conferees for a meeting would
probably be forwarded later after he
had conferred with General Funston
and had gone over again Instructions
from Washington. He declined to
venture a statement as to whether
the conference would terminate tha
