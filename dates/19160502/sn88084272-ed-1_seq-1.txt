DUBLIN, Ireland, May 2. No attempt has yet been made to estimate the property damage resulting from the
Sinn Fein rebellion in Dublin, Ireland, which centered in the district about Sackville street. The general post
office, the pillard braiding shown at the left, was practically demolished by shells fired by the British troops be
seiging the Irish rebels entrenched inside. Seventeen were killed in Sackville street almost at the outbreak of the rioting.
Fighting also centered about O'Connell's monument, shown in the center. Practically all the large buildings in the district
shown suffered heavily from rifle, machine gun and artillery fire before the rebels were shelled out.
Sir Roger Casement, shown in the upper left hand corner, is the Irish knight whose effort of many months to
launch, through Germany, an Irish rebellion, finally culminated in his arrest when he accompanied a munition laden tramp
steamer from Germany to the Irish coast. He is now held in London, facing trial on a charge of high tttaftoa.
