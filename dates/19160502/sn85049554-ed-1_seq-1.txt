ate Criticising Secretary Daniela

Washington, May 2.—Vice President
Marshall, in doubt as to the propriety of

ten," wrote 'Air. Daniels on April 21. "I
find on Inquiry that it was filed with
the chief clerk without, my knowledge.
Altho Admiral Fiske was In my office
daily he did not tell me he had placed
the communication on file."
In his letter to the senate Admiral
Fiske declares he personally handed
Secretary Daniels a copy of his paper
on preparedness, watched him read it,
and says others can testify as to the
occurrence.
Admiral Fiske asked_jfor an oppor
tunity to be hearji on tlie subject but
if it is not granted that his letter to
the senate he published.

ATTACKED BY SUBMARINE.
Torpedo Passes Under the Bow of
Frenoh Liner Patria.
New York, May 2.—Shaving death
by ten feet is an experience revealed
here when the French passenger
steamer Patria arrived from 'Naples
and Palermo.
Captain Pierre Dechelle reported
that on the liner's last outward voy
age It was attacked at 10 a. m., April
S. by a submarine. A 'torpedo passed
under the ship's bow, rhlssing. it only
by a short margin.
Failure of the captain to see a perl*
scope leads him to believe the sub*
marine was equipped with an under
sea sight device. If this theory prove*
correct It will explain the mystery In
a number of recent submarine attacks

Captain Dechelle. "It was too la
to do anything. I estimate that thai
torpedo was traveling about thirty**
five knots. It went by under the boW»
