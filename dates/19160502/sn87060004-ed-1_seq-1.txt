realized and will be used in furnish

SCHOOL CENSUS
IS SATISFACTORY"
Ten New Families in District
and Many Six-Year-Olds
ONLY TWO ILLITERATE
CHILOREN OUT OF 605
ON THE CENSUS
The school census has been com
pleted and, while there is a small de
crease in the number of pupil child
ren in the district as compared with
last year, the results are considered
very satisfactory under the conditions
of business depression that have ob
tained in this section of the countm
which have resulted in the removai
of a large number of families from.
Earlington, Madisonville and other
portions of Hopkins County to dis
tant locations where business hasv
been made good because of the war
demand for coal that can be shipped
to the Seaboard and for gun powder
and many other products that are re
quired in large quantities by the na
tions at war.
The total number of pupil children
in the district on April 1st was' 605.
There were 806 boys and 299 girls.
It is to be noticed again that the:
Earlington census always show x
slightly greater number or boys than
girls. This is a decrease of about 5
percent fromthe total census enroll
ment of a year ago which was 644.
Miss Mary Mothershead, who took
the census again this year, found
some ten new families had moved in
to the distiict. There are a large
number of six-year-olds, so that the
primary gradeswill be full next fahV
One fact was noticed in makine up
the list that there were only a very-
few children of fourteen years.
The remarkajble fact of the absencA
of illiteracyamong ;the children or
the district is again emphasized this
year. This census shows that we
have only two illiterate- children in
the entire district. These children
are seventeen and thirteen yeaVs of
age respectively and did not live in
the Earlington district during their
early years soj;that the conditions
here are not responsible for their illit
eracy. It will be; remembered that
last year therewas not a single illit
erate child in the district.
The results of the census of the
colored children are not at hand, but
it is understood that census will alsa
show a decrease of abdut 5 percent
11 the total number in the district.
