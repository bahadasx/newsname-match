British Relief Workers Car
ing for Sufferers From
Week's Warfare.
Dublin. Jlav 2, (12:02 a. m'via
London, 10:1.") a. m.) Soldiers are
completing a thorough search of
the city and it is hoped that within
a few hours they will account for
Ihe last of the snipers, a small
hand of rebels which has been
caiisinir a diversion in neighbor
hood of Balis Bridge. This band
was snhiecled to artillery tire Mon
day afternoon. A few of the rebels
arc holding out. Train communi
cation is still intcrmpted.
Quirt reigned in the streets of Dub
lin today. There was little traffic and
the thoroughfares were still strongly
held by the military forces of the gov
ernment. Only a few sniping shots were heard
Sunday night.
A shortage of food has caused much
distress in several districts but with
th resumption of almost normal con
ditions the committee charged with
looking after the needs of the popula
tion expects to relieve those in want
within a very short time.
Easiness Men Cramped.
It is still impossible to get from one
part of Dublin to another without mil
itary permit and merchants residing
in the suburbs are in most cases quite
ignorant of what has happened to their
business property. Business men who
are unable to get money from their
banks in the city which are closed
have scraped together all the funds
they can borrow from suburban banks
to pay their employes.
A Few Scattered Rebels Left.
Authorities expect that a few days
should see the last of armed rebellion
in Ireland. A flicker still is apparent
not far from Dublin where a small
group of adherents of James Larkin
have ensconsed themselves.
Further to the west of the capital
there are still a band of insurgents.
The rebels are skeptical of the assur
ances given them that their comrades
in Dublin have surrendered. A mobile
force of British soldiers is moving into
the mountains today preventing the
Sinn Feins from assembling, and ar
resting their leaders.

Laredo, Texas May 2. The war
department has instructed the
commander at Fort Jlclntosh to
stop all shipments of war muni
tions to Mexico. A half million
rounds of riile cartridges held by
customs inspectors on accdunt of
questionable destinations will be
taken in charge by the local mili
tary. Washington, May 2-The cabi

Officials reiterated there was no
change in the plan of the American
government to keep the troops in Mex
ico until the bandits were completely
dispersed. The first fighting in tho
Carranza campaign against Zapata,

El Paso, Texas, May 2. Major Gen

Washington in which the administra
tion stated that no agreement was to
be reached that was based on any
preparation for the immediate with
drawal of the American troops from
Mexico.
A second conference with General
Obregon, minister of war for the de
facto government, will probably b3
held this afternoon in Kl Paso. Indi-
cations were that it would be the la6t
one. The Mexican conferees having
become acquainted with the admin
istration's position on withdrawal,
through press dispatches, showed their
disappointment. A Mexican conferee
said today that if the re
quest was not met at this conference
there was no reason to fear that ser
ious trouble between the two countries
would follow.
I'p to Two Governments.
"The question of withdrawing th!
troops," said - the Carranza official,
"will then revert to Washington for
future negotiations between the state
department and Mr. Arrcdondo, the
Mexican ambassador. At the confer
ence here we have given reasons from
a military standpoint why American
soldiers should retire to their own ter
ritory and this information should be
valuable in a future determination of
the question now before the state de
partment." The American generals were ready
today to submit detailed plans for co
operation between the Carranza and
American forces in the pursuit of Villa
and his bands, but it was understood
that General Obregon would suggest
that he did not feel disposed to discuss
that proposal. Should the minister of
war take this position it was thought
' that the conference would then bo
ended.
General Funston believes that the
American army is prepared to meet
any eventuality.
