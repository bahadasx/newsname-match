WHITE CLAIMS AU
HONORS AS AXE MAN
Insists Thet He Sent Wife for Wood
Sputter and Held Lawyer and
Barber at Bay.
John F. White cailed at the office
of The Herald this morning and In
sisted that he alone waa the party
who brandished the axe and routed
O. Q. Knudson. proprietor of a bar
ber shop in the Central hotel, South
Fourth street, and a local attorney
from Knudson's place of business yes
terday.
Mr. White stated that he sent his
wife. Mrs. Llssle White, former pro
prietress of the Central hotel and
barber shop, for the axe and that he
alone did all the flourishing after it
was delivered to him and kept the
barber and lawyer out of the place.
The impression was gained at first,
that Mrs. White was marching on the
retreating foe when she hove into
view with the axe on her shoulder,
but.Mr. White wants all these honors.
The trouble arose over the fact that
Mr. and Mrs. White would not permit
the holder of the sheriff's certificate
of sale of Mrs. White's property to do
his duty.

Burglars Take $3 in Cash,
But Shy at Dainty Togs

Burglars broke into the Great Nor

North Dakota some time last evening
and escaped with $3 in cash.
The thugs gained entrance to the
place by smashing a window. One
plain fact stands out in bold relief.
They were not women, for they dis
dained to take along some choice bits
of feminine wearing apparel.
They broke into three trunks be
longing to Miss Jennie Hale and Miss
Bernadlne Swarthout. both university
students.
After rummaging around in the
lingerie for a whole, the burglars de
cided they couldn't wear the garments
and that an attempt to sell the same
would almost amount to suicide so
they contented themselves with the
93 in cash which they secured from
the cash register and betook them
selves off.
The authorities have been notified
of the theft and are working on sev
eral clues. However, no arrests had
been made at a late hour this after
noon.
The theft was hot discovered until
this morning when Max Taubert, the
agent, arrived at the station.

It was about a year ago that he
