them by without consideration.

are enthusiastic in their ex-,

by censor >.? Uetieral l.uis Herrera, ui:
t! 1 recently Carrnnxa Military Coveriior
of C'liitiuahua, has renounced Carranza
a nd announced himself in favor of
Villa, taking the field in West Chihua
hua with ".000 troops, according to re
liable information received here >o
niuht.
The exact place at whi-'h Ceiier.il
Herrera's troops are encamped was
r.ot indicated in the message. whlc^
reached Columbus from a source that
nhvays has l>*eti fo\md reliable it is
believed, however, that the troops,
most of whom recently constituted the
Carratr/a garrison at Chihuahua City,
are now somewhere between San I'edro
and Chihuahua, ami are preparing to
work north and west toward the
American punitive expedition In the
field utidei: Ucneral Pershing
This district, which lies, about sev
enty miles directly cast of the Guer
rero region, in which Villa began his
days as an outlaw, is strongly in
favor of the bandit chieftain. His sue*
in -withstanding I'ortirio Diaz's
runties for eight years, during all of
which time there was a heavy price
on his head, was due to the loyalty of
the peons. Army men hero believe
that Herrera and hi.* command will
have every co-operation from the peo
ple of his district.
