tion, thus expressing to him due ap
preciatiou and gratitude for bis most

QUAKER TIRE8 HERE
In another column is the first an
nouncement of the Quaker City Rub
ber Company, Philadelphia, manufac
turers of the famous Quaker Tempe
ed Rubber Tires which' are now on
sale in this community. These tires
are well known from coast to coast to
dealers in nearly all of the important
cities and towns.'
More than five years ago. the mak
ers of Quaker Tires arrived at the con
clusion that the most Important ad
vance in tire making would be along
the lines of a special treatment of the
rubber to secure maximum cohesion
of the plies of fabric and to impart
the exact degrees of hardness, tough
ness, flexibility, elasticity, resiliency
and tensile strength to provide not
only the full measure of mlleag? but
to Increase the easy riding feature for
which the pneumatic tire was original
ly designed.
After long and exhaustive experi
mentation the Quaker - City Rubber
Company's chemists and tire experts
discovered a method of tempering the
rubber. This process : secret and
exclusive.
Quaker Tires are not only known to
all users of automobiles but are also
known as "Miles Cheaper" tires.

"THE DUST OF THE EARTH"
A SUCCESS
The Cap and Bells Dramatic Club
of the Central High School with its
play, "The Dust of the Earth", prov-
j ed to be a decided success at the City
School Building last Saturday even
ing, and - Judging from that nights
performance, the Club bids fair In
the future. .
The play has all the requirements
of a first class comedy-drama. The
plot is good, the cast of characters,
appropriate, and the interpretation'
of each part excellent.
There are ten characters In the cast
and each one, though amateur de
serves mention. Bryan Cowden as
"David Moore", head of the Moore
family of Maple Farm Cottage, por
trays a typical rustic farmer, white
Naomi Ensor as "Susan Moore' typi
fies a high-strung and high tempered
country dam. Janie Low a "Mia
Arabella" the village gossiper and
newspaper, .and Victor McClaln as
"Jerry", the comical fisher-lad vt-i
with Mr. Harrison as "Mose" who
does 'charity' to the neighbors hea
roosts, as to who can make the most
fun for the andience. Robert Elrod
as "Dr. Templetbn" and McGregor
Smith as "John Ryder" prove their,
ability in public love-making. Jess
Walters as "Elizabeth Moore", a chip
off the old block, portrays a rain and
high-headed country maiden, while
Mildred Cooper as 'Nell', character
izing 'The Dust of the Earth', and
Willard Wirt as "Wandering Tom'
represent the two characters, about
whom the mystery of the play Is cen
tered. Considering the play from every
point of view, it is not only the best
entertainment given here" this , sea
son, but even the best ever given
here by local talent ' ,
The members of the Cap and Belt
Dramatic Club deserve much prats '
and encouragement in their marked
achievements. " f
