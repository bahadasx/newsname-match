was in this neighborhood again
this week.
As Mr. and Mrs. R. C. Haynes
and little son, Lloyd, of Norwich,
Kansas, were , driving , over to
Fowler last Thursday, they met
with what might have, been a
serious accident. When they
were crossing the railroad at
Minneola the shaft of the auto
dropped down, catchirg on the
railroad track. The car was
stopped so suddenly that the oc
cupants were thrown violently
forward over the windshield. ?A
head light of an approaching
train was seen not far away but
Mr. Haynes had the presence of
mind to pull his wife and baby
out and push the car off the
track. When Mr. Haynes pick
ed up the baby he thought it was
dead but was only asleep and did
not receive a scratch.
After they arrived home Dr,
Robb was called but no serious
injuries were lound. Unly a
few scratches were received.
' We are glad to know that the
accident'did not prove fatal. Mr.
and Mrs. Haynes returned for
(Norwich, Saturday, accompanied
by Mr. Haynes' father, who will
visit in Wichita a few days.
Prairie Fires Responsible
For Big Property Loss
Monday of this week being a
calm, quiet day, the employees
of the Theis ranch took advant
age of it, and burned some straw
stacks. The wind Tuesday
spread the burned straw and a
few live sparks soon bad tbe
entire prairie in flames. Almost
with tbe speed of lightning it
swept across Logan and Sand
Creek townships and into Clark
county, leaving a strip of buraed
prairie, ten miles wide, behind.
The work of fire fighters saved
some of the homes it its path,
but barns and out-buildings in
almost every instance were left
in ashes.
The losses reported so far are:
a barn and twelve head of hogs
for Ralph Cole; barn and house
for John Heap; barn and several
hundred bushels of grain for
Tom Veatch, ;and a barn for
Jake Heap. ,Tbe amount of
damage done in Clark county
has not beenllearned.
The same day 'another fire
swept from Satanta south to'tbe
Cimarron river, burning every
thing in its path. No lives were
lost in either fiire.

Another Engine at
Electric Light Plant
Some substantial improve
ments are being made at the
light plant. First, and perhaps
most important of all, is tbe ad
dition of a second engine, now
in transient, also a -generator.
A new building is being erected
to house same. With this ad
dition will come a day current,
beginning May first, The pat
ronage received will govern the
length of the seryice.
The new nitrogen streetlights
will be installed May first. The
office will be moved from its
present location to the first door
south of tbe main entrance to
Phelps theatre.
Due to the fact that we have
bad no moisture to speak of since
October, a variety of opinions
are on the market regarding the
condition of the wheat. Many
contend that it is yet unharmed
notwithstanding the long dry
spell, that the ground still con
tains considerable moisture, and
that a rain now, or a little later
on, will make a crop. inere
are also those who are convinced
beyond any reasonable doubt
that tbe crop and the country
have eone to the bow wows. We
are glad those of such an opin
ion are in the minority, and it is
our guess that we are going to
have rain, and good crops.
We have beard a number of
people complaining about tbe
large amount of waste papers
and boxes which daily collect in
woven wire fences, fence corners
hedges and numerous other
places, Besides being unsightly
in appearance there is great
danger in case of fire. It only
takes a little while to burn such
trash and then you are certain
that it will never again anoy any
one. Try this method of dis
posing of old papers and what
little time you are out on tbe
transaction will be more than
made up in the improvement of
it will be to your neighbor's
yards and fences.
See those special films at tbe
movies every Thursday night
and be convinced that, they are
the best ever.
Archie Sweet the Grant county
man charged with the murder of
Nellie Bvers, will be defended
by Jake I Sheppard of Fort
Scott. Sheppard is the famous
Socialist lawyer and able to take
good care of his client. It is ex
pected that Sweet will be tried
at the April term of court, but
Sheppard will probably ask for a
change of venue because of prcju
dicey against Sweet in Grant
county. Pratt Union.
Coming to Meade to Stay

ferent towns along the Rock Is

vice, feel that he knows bis busi

The' European Was Has a
Bad Effect on Auto Tags
Topeka, March 22 There will
not be many fancy colors on mot
or car tags until the big Europe
an war is over or some American
dye maker discovers how to make
dyes like those made in Ger
many. J. T. Botkin, secretary
of state, and Curtis Myers, his
motor car license head, have just
purchased the new 1916 tags for
the Kansas motor cars. They
discovered that tbe war hit tbe
motor car tag business in two
places. It hiked the price of tbe
steel until the state has to pay
half a cent more for the tags than.
last year and it also prohibited
the state making much of a
change in colors.
The new tags arc a black back
ground with white letters and'
until tbe war ends or someone'
discovers how to make dyes, the
tags will continue to be a combi- -nation
of these two colors. Here
tofore there has been a complete
change of colors in tbe tags each-
year. . This was done to prevent'
some folk using tbe old tags a'
second year. A few got cans of
... . '
paint ana made toe changeis-any
way, f
When tbe contract for the new
tags was let there were not very
many colors offered, and any
colors except white and black
were offered at much higher
prices than these two. The con
tractors said that it was impos
sible toget some colors and other
dyes, suitable for enamel paints
were very high and there was no
assurance that sufficient colors
could be secured to supply tbe
Kansas tags. There bad been
no change in the price of black
and of white enamel and there
was an ample supply.
To prevent people painting
over the old tags the state bad a
monogram of the letters "Kan."
designed and this will be used
this year. It is impossible to
change tbe letters on tbe tags
and a home made fake tag will be
easily detected. Tbe new tags
will be sold after July 1st.'
We observe some of the hitch
racks Lave been removed from
Main street, while others yet
remain, notwithstanding tbe fact
that the ordinance prohibiting,
them has been in force several
days.'
