Dowa Town Market
Gardening Is to be a regular part
of the school work in the grades and
high school of the Alliance public
schools from this on. At least the
plans for taking up the work at once
are about completed and If the man
agement considers the first year's
work a success It will be made a per
manent part of tbe school work.
The work will be In charge of Pro
fessor E. Q. Perry, who Is the instruc
tor in the agricultural department of
the school, and the local manage
raent will have the co-operation of
the United States government
through the University of Nebraska.
Tha local school board had decided
definitely to take up thhj work and
were lust beginning to lay out the
plans when they received word that
Alliance Is one of twelve schools In
the state w'hich had been selected by
the government as schools in which
they would like to see the work tak
en up and which they would extend
every assistance possible.
No financial assistance will be ex
tended by the government but ex
perts in this line of work will be sent
out from time to time to give special
lectures and instruction with regard
to the work and to offer suggestions
The work Is not compulsory, being
purely optional with the students,
bnt credits will be allowed on the
regular school grades to thoBe stud
ents participating in the gardening
project. In the grade schools a cred
it of three percent will be added to
the arithmetic and also on the lan
guage grades of those students grow
ing a garden of 100 square feet, and
five per rent for those growing 200
square Teet or more providing the
work is done properly and according
to the instructions. In the high
school a credit of one point will be
allowed if the work is done according
to the Instructions of the supervisor
The gardening will be done at the
homes, and each student will be n
quired to keep accurnte records and
submit reports with a written hi
count of how the work was done and
the results obtained.
Prizes will be offered by the Com
mercial Club, school board and Wom
an's Club for the student making the
most money, for the one vlio writes
the bent account of his ork. for tli
one raising the most and best of spec-
lilied vegetables. This list has not
yet been con pleted.
Mr. Perry, who will be in charge
of the work', will be in Alliance all
summer. The work in this depart
ment begins with the spring planting,
runs through the entire summer and
ends with the fall harvest. Students
will be required to keep their ground
working. That is. to engage in "in
tensive farming" as it is termed in
the thickly settled regions of the
east and in the old country, and as
fast as one crop or a part of it is har
vested another will be started.
As soon 8 the garden truck is
ready for the market proper arrange
ments will be made in the business
district for the students to dispose of
their products at a fair price. The
details of these plans are also yet to
be worked out.

at a special meeting to be held in the

day afternoon, March 31.
That western Nebraska has beem
made the "goat" for commission mer
chants, potato buyers and speculators
for years is tho opinion of many wh
are in touch with those things and aa
effort is going to be made to change
the conditions. It In said that la
many of the big markets Box Butte
county and western Nebraska are
given credit for any poor batch of
spuds shipped in from any direction.
east, north or west, and that we are
not given the credit due us for the
fine specimens that comprise a large
oportlon of the shipments sent out
from here. This procedure It Is
thought Is largely responsible for the
unreasonably low prices frequently
prevailing.
Parties who have made investiga
tions, who have made a study of the
matter and are in a position to know,
state that western Nebraska spuds
average, car for car, better thaa
those shipped from any other section.
They also state that this average ia
rapidly being improved and it Is hop
ed that plans may be formulated at
this meeting which will eventually
result In much greater demands and
correspondingly higher market prices
on our spuds.
It has been suggested that if the
potaoto growers will organize that
the first step in this direction will be
taken. It is also suggested that if in
the event of such organization the
members will adopt the plan of sort
ing their product and disposing of the
culls by feeding or In unlabeled ship
ments, while the cream of the pro4
uct bears the label "Sorted, Graded
and Inspected by the Northwest Ne
braska Potato Growers Association,"
that it will be only a short time till
buyers everywhere will begin to de
mand our potatoes, and local grow
ers will begin to reap a reasonable
reward for their hard work.
At this meeting, the 31st, C. E.
Bassett, of the United Slates Depart
ment of Markets and Rural Organiza
tion, will be present and make an ad
dress on the subject. The govern
ment has made an exhaustive study
of similar conditions with various
crops all over the country and Mr.
BaBsett is one of the best Informed
men In the country. ' He comes here
enroute back east from California,
where he has spent two months In his
official capacity In the interest of the
fruit growers' associations of that re
gion. This questlou is of direct interest
to every farmer and land owner, of
equal importance to the business men
and indirectly a mutter in which ev
ery citizen is concerned. A small ad
vance per bushel in the price of spuds
to the local growers means in the ag
gregate, thousands of dollars to this
community each year.
