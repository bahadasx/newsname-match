SAYS YOUHANS
HADE NO SPEECH
SENATOR HOLLIS OF NEW HAMP­
SHIRE "TIES INTO" NORTH DA
KOTAN SENT TO WASHINGTON
TO MEET COMMITTEE—McCUM
BER EXPLAINS FOR MINOT
MAN.
From the Congressional Record is­
sued at Washington, March 13, 1916,
there appears to have been a rather in­
teresting session, all on account of the
recent visit of Grant S. Youmans, who
was sent to that city recently by the
farmers' societies of the state to do
what he could to defeat the Moss
Hollis Rural Credit bill. The Indepen­
dent editorially last week discussed
this measure, which we do not believe
is what the farmers want at all. We
print below an extract from the rec­
ord, giving an interesting discussion
on the bill, together with charges
made by the New Hampshire Senator
that Mr. Youmans did not appear be­
fore the committee, and with a state­
ment from Senator McCumber:
Mr. HOLLIS. Mr. President
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the
Senator from North Dakota yield to
the Senator from New Hampshire?
Mr. McCUMBER. Certainly.
Mr. HOLLIS. The distinguished
Senator says that the people, or rather
the farmers, of North Dakota have
been to Washington to express their
sentiments upon the pending rural
credits bill. Will the Senator give the
names of those men?
Mr. McCUMBER. I will give the
name of a representative who was
here just a short time ago. He did
not arrive here until after this com­
mittee had reported, but he represent­
ed all these organizations. I attempt­
ed to secure for him a hearing in the
other House, but they were too busy
just then to grant it and so he filed
his objections to the bill as the repre­
sentative of the farming organizations
of the Northwest.
Mr. HOLLIS. Is that man Grant S.
Youmans?
Mr. McCUMBER. Yes.
Mr. HOLLIS. And is he the only
one the Senator has seen
Mr. McCUMBER. Oh, Mr. Presi­
dent, I have had petitions and letters
from thousands of men representing
the different local societies.
Mr. HOLLIS. Has the Senator filed
any of those petitions of protest with
the Banking and Currency Commit­
tee?
Mr. McCUMBER. Oh, yes there
have been a great many of them filed.
Mr. HOLLIS. Filed with the com­
mittee?
Mr. McCUMBER. Yes there have
been some filed here as petitions and
referred to the committee.
Mr. HOLLIS. I think the Senator
knew that I was chairman of the com­
mittee that was considering this sub­
ject, and I ask him if he has called
any of them to my attention until this
moment
Mr. McCUMBER. I suppose that
when a petition is filed and referred to
a committee it receives attention with­
out the Senator's calling it to the no­
tice of the chairman of the committee.
Mr. HOLLIS. Now, I should like
to ask the Senator if Mr. Youmans
showed him his credentials to speak
for the farmers of North Dakota
Mr. McCUMBER. Oh, yes, Mr.
President he did.
Mr. HOLLIS. And what does he rep
resent?
Mr. McCUMBER. He represents the
Equity Societies and also the Non­
partisan League of the State.
Mr. HOLLIS. If the Senator will
permit me, I have here a Senate docu­
ment, printed on the motion of the dis­
tinguished Senator from North Dako­
ta, which purports to be a speech de­
livered before the Committee on Bank­
ing and Currency of the House of Rep­
resentatives. Upon having it brought
to my attention this morning, I con­
ferred with the chairman of the Bank­
ing and Currency Committee of the
House, and he sent me this written
message:
This is a barefaced fraud. This
man has never delivered a speech
before the Banking and Currency
Committee of the House. He has
never appeared before the com­
mittee. He has never asked to
appear, and would not be permit
ted to appear, since the Banking
and Currency Committee of the
House is having no hearings.
Mr. Youmans on Saturday, I be­
lieve, left with me a typewritten
criticism, rather rude, largely ig­
norant, of House Bill 6838, now be
,, ing perfected, which seems to be
to some extent a reproduction of
an anonymous pamphlet recently
issued. This is all there is to this
alleged "speech" before the House
Banking and Currency Committee.
I should like to add to that that the
Senator's colleague (Mr. Gronna) no­
tified me some 10 days ago that Mr.
Youmans was on his way here and
that he would like a hearing. I
agreed with the junior Senator from
North Dakota that I would get a hear­
ing for him. Mr. Youmans appeared.
The junior Senator from North Dako­
ta told me that he would be glad to
give him a hearing. Mr. Youmans de­
clined to have a hearing before our
it as re
jections of any kind to us, and he has
gone home. Now, he has compiled an
anonymous pamphlet that has been
distributed this winter, and the author
of which evidently knew nothing about
the bill, this so-called speech before
the Banking and Currency Committee
of the House.
I wish to state to the Senator that
his colleague has been on this commit­
tee. His colleague has voted to report
this bill favorably. While there may
be some things in it that he would like
to have changed, he is to have, every
opportunity to present them to the
Senate. It is not a partisan bill. It
has been expressly kept a nonpartisan
bill. The farmers of North Dakota
have had every chance to be heard for
the past two years and a half, and the
bill has had the most careful consider­
ation.
I think so much is due at this stage
of the proceedings.
Mr. McCUMBER. Mr. President, if
the gentleman whose letter has just
been read had given half as much con­
sideration to the requests that were
made for hearings and requests upon
my part in sending over various par­
ties, there probably would have been
a hearing accorded Mr. Youmans in
his committee.
Mr. POMERENE. Mr. President
Mr. McCUMBER. Let me answer
the Senator's question first and then
I will yield to the Senator from Ohio.
As a matter of fact, here is the
case: This Mr. Youmans, who repre­
sents these societies, did not arrive
here until after the bill had been re­
ported from the Senate committee.
Therefore, the bill having been report­
ed, there was nonnecessity for asking
that committee for any further hear­
ing, because his objections probably
would not have been even read. I
found that it was inconvenient for the
House committee to get together, and
it was perfectly satisfactory to Mr.
Youmans to present his article in the
form of a written statement. As he
prepared it, he c::pected to deliver it
orally. Finding that it would be in­
convenient, he simply filed the state­
ment, and while it reads upon the face
of it as he intended it should in the
first instance, a speech delivered, it
would have been more proper, as it
was, if he had said "speech presented,"
because it was simply presented to the
committee in the House, and then, by
my request, it was ordered to be print­
ed.
DEATH VALLEY DODGE
AGAIN WINS FAME.
Driven by Teddy Tetzlaff, It JVfakes
All But Impossible Night Trip
Over Mountains.
"Death Valley Dodge," the famous
Dodge Brothers motor car that was
the vehicle of a trip last year through
Death Valley that attracted national
attention because of the nature of the'
journey, has won new fame on the'
co&st*
Driven by Teddy Tetzlaff, the fa-j
mous racing driver, the car made the
night trip over the mountains of Cali-'
fornia from Nordhoff, in the Ojai val­
ley, to San Lius Obispo in slightly
more than 12 hours.
The run was started at 10 o'clock
at night after all the wiseacres had
predicted that it would be impossible
to get through, owing to the conditions
of the roads, which are regarded as
exceedingly dangerous, even in the day
of the roads, which are regarded as
time.
Tetzlaff, in discussing the trip, said:
"It's alright when you have confi­
dence in your car. There were some
bad places on the road where we
wound around the edge of a precipice
and there were various spots where
you wanted to be sure that both
brakes and transmission were depend­
able. But I had tried out the Dodge
Brothers motor car and I had every
confidence that it would not be the
fault of the car if we failed."

It will bring a few tears, many
aughs and keep you on the edge of
your seat during the four acts. It will
be presented by a great company that
plays only in the larger cities.
Fine Feathers will be presented May

No Election Held in Nedrose.
Owing to Tuesday's storm, no elec­
tion was held in Nedrose township,
just east of Minot. Chas. Moore, the
election inspector, found it impossible
to make the trip to the polling place,
consequently the polls were not open­
ed. Had he done so, it is believed that
not more than half a dozen votes
would have been cast.

M'COY STORE
ADVERTISING MANAGER BE­
COMES GENERAL MANAGER
OF GROWING CONCERN—P. V.
McCOY IS PRESIDENT.
C. E. DeNoon, who has been assist­
ant manager of the McCoy Depart­
ment store for the past three years,
has bought a good sized interest in the
business, and has assumed the position
as manager. Mr. DeNoon's promotion
is well merited. He has been engaged
in the mercantile business for the past
twenty years and he has assisted in
building up the large business of this
store to what it is today. He came
here from Iowa three years ago and
he hasn't found time to do much of
anything but work since—and he has
some capacity for work. Mr. DeNoon
is at heme in the business wherever
you put him. He is re^f.rded as a
window trimmer and show card writ­
er second to none in the state. He is
familiar with the stock in practically
every one of the eleven departments.
He finds time to mingle vvith the cus­
tomers. He has filled the position of
assistant manager exceptionally well
and as a matter of recreation writes
the advertisements. Mr. DeNoon is
held in the highest esteem by the bus­
inessmen and citizens of Minot and
v'cimty generally.
Paul V. McCoy is the president of
the company and retains his interests
largely in the growing concern. He.
will be out of the city most of the
time in the future. While his plans
for the future have not been announc­
ed, they will be of interest when made
public. Mr McCoy's interests in Mi­
not and elsewhere are so varied and
extensive that he could no longer find
time to act as manager, but he will
make occasional visits to our city and
will be in a position to give the var­
ious stores in which he is interested
some attention. He expects to visit
New York frequently and will be in a
position to assist in the buying. Mr.
McCoy came to Minot fourteen years
ago and his success has been nothing
short of phenomenal.
The department store will continue
to make improvements and as good
merchandise values as ever will be
given. The store owns its merchan­
dise at from 25 to 40 per cent less than
many stores, having bought early be­
fore marketing conditions became so
serious.
Miss Maude Berry now has direct
charge of the garment department.
Harry Lindhoff of Detroit, Mich., ar­
rived to take charge of the windows
and card writing. The sales force has
been increased and the store is in a po­
sition to do a record breaking business
this year.
Stewart Gets Shrapnel Shell.
B. E. Stewart of the Minot Hide &
Tanning Co. showed the Independent
a specimen of shrapnel shell which
is being manufactured for the Allies
by a concern in Ohio. A train load of
the shells a day is being turned out by
that factory. The shell is nearly a
foot long and three inches in diame­
ter. The point of the shell is screwed
on. The shell, when ready for action,
is filled with bits of scrap iron and is
most dangerous. It is provided with
an adjustable cap. This is the first
shell of its kind seen in Minot.

the event that serious trouble occurs to
our army in Mexico, and this is just
what may be looked for at any time,
it is believed that the North Dakota
regiment will be called out.

ESCAPED MURDERER
MISSOURI PENITENTIARY OF­
FICER CAUSES ARREST OF
JOHN WILLIS, WHO CONDUCT­
ED RESTAURANT HERE FOR
YEARS—STORY OF THE CRIME.
John Willis, who has conducted a
restaurant just south of the Great
Northern depot in this city for the
past five years, was placed under ar­
rest Monday afternoon, charged with
being a fugitive from justice.
J. F. Hardin, assistant yard master
of the state penitentiary located at
Jefferson City, Mo., arrived that af­
ternoon and caused the arrest of Wil­
lis. He believes that Willis is none
other than John Franklin, alias John
French, alias Frank Jones, alias Du
lu+h Johnny, alias John Willis, who
from the authorities Jan. 17,
M)6,' while serving a 99 year term for
murder.
When Officer Hardin arrived, he
went to the office of Chief of Police
Dougherty, who telephoned to Willis.
When the man appeared at the city
jail, he was confronted by the Mis­
souri officer, who accused him of be
in gthe escaped convict. Willis "went
up into the air" immediately and
stated that he was innocent. He was
taken to the county jail, however,
where he now is. He has employed
D. C. Greenleaf, who is attempting to
secure his release on habeas corpus
proceedings.
When Willis was arrested he tele­
phoned his wife that he was in the
hands of the law, but she did not in­
quire* what was the trouble. She
merely advised him to secure the ser­
vices of an attorney immediately.
Willis is about 35 years of age and
his wife, who was Mary Ryan, is ten
years his senior.
Willis was arrested some time ago
charged with conducting a blind pig,
but he was found not guilty.
John Franklin was sent to the pen­
itentiary from Jasper county, Mis­
souri, May 23, 1905, to serve a ninety
nine year sentence for murdering a
policeman. Franklin, who was a noted
yegg, was caught in the act of blowing
a safe in a Jewelry store in Joplin,
Mo. He murdered an officer who at­
tempted to make his arrest, but was
apprehended later, tried and convict­
ed. The robbery was one of the bold­
est known in Missouri. The safe was
located in the front of the store and
the yegg left the lights burning while
he did the job. His confederate, E. P.
Butler, alias "Foot-and-half," was al­
so arrested and he is serving a 99
year sentence.
Franklin and another convict were
being taken to Jasper county from the
penitentiary by an officer to testify in
Butler's trial when they made their es­
cape. They were handcuffed together,
and giving the chains a terrific jerk
they broke themselves apart. One
dashed around one corner of a build­
ing and the other around the other
and both got away. Franklin's com­
panion has since died.
Officer Hardin does not say how he
learned that Willis was located in Mi­
not, but declares that the authorities
got their information thru some un­
derground system. He declares that
there is little question but that Willis
is none other than John Franklin. He
agreed to take Willis back to the pen­
itentiary and if it could be learned that
he is not the man wanted, the state of
Missouri will reimburse him well for
all the trouble he has had and send
him back to Minot. Willis, it is be­
lieved, will put up a scrap before he
allows the officers to take him back.
He is said to have appeared^ "mulish"
when the officers were examining him
to see if the marks on his body would
correspond with those of-Franklin, ac­
cording to the prison records. Hardin
declares that out of eighteen marks of
identification, seventeen correspond
perfectly. For instance, Willis has
three scars on his right thumb, scars
over the right and left brows, two
marks of vaccination on the right arm,
a mole between the shoulders and an­
other on the back, all these marks cor­
responding with those of Franklin.
A scar over Franklin's eye could not
be located on Willis, but the officer
states that the lines of the man's face
might account for this. Willis is 3-4
of an inch taller than Franklin's meas­
urements, but the officer states that
this might easily be accounted for.
When Franklin's measurements were
taken he might not have been standing
erect, and then he might have grown
a little since.
A Bertillion man, Galvin, arrived
from Minneapolis yesterday and he
declares that he has reasons to believe
that Willis is the man wanted.
Officer Hardin brot with him a pic­
ture of Franklin. This resembles
Willis some, but naturally in ten years
Franklin must have changed in ap­
pearance some.
The Missouri penitentiary is the
largest single penal institution in the
world. There are 2877 inmates at the
present time, while the high water
mark is 2910.
The Minneapolis man took Willis'
measurements carefully and found a
difference of beft from one to four
points in four instances. A point in
the Bertillion system represents a dis­
tance no greater than the thickness of
a sheet of common writing paper.
One of the guards who worked
Franklin is on the way from the pen­
itentiary. He will arrive Friday
night. The Missouri authorities never
give up looking for a prisoner who
gets away. Out of the 34 who escaped
while working outside the institution
all have been caught except four. An
escaped convict gets two years addi­
tional if captured.
RAILWAY COMMISSIONERS
TO MEET IN MINOT.
April 4, 5 and 6 the railroad com­
mission will hold hearings at Minot
when the following cases will be
heard: Crossings at Tuttle and Car
rington spur track to mill at New
Rockford spur track to mine at Beu
lah waiting room at Shepard Siding
station agent at Hoving, new depot at
Deisem new depot at Dodge depot
and agent at Lostwood depot at Bat
tleview depot and agent at Carbury
agent at Logan depot at Mason de­
pot and agent at Wolseth Siding de­
pot at Cartwright depot at Bottineau
stockyards at Dodge and Clifton im­
provements to yards at Kathryn, Os
nabrock, Lakota, Clifford and Gales
burg platforms at Kuroki and Ray
siding for elevator at Powell Siding
site for elevator at Juanita and sever­
al matters of local train service.
In addition to the above the com­
mission will shortly after the Minot
meeting- hold a nunjber of hearings
on matters pertaining to telephones
and grain warehouses at different
points, the outlook at present being
good for a very busy year for the
board.
Sell Overland Cars on Credit Plan.
The Minot Auto Company are of­
fering exceptional terms in the way of
credit on Overland cars this spring.
While this idea is not a new one in
other lines of merchandise, it is dead­
ly an innovation for the automobile
trade, as heretofore, most of the stan­
dard cars have been sold practically on
a strict cash basis.
Very few families will now have to
deprive themselves of the pleasures
and comforts that can be derived from
the use of an automobile, as the Minot
Auto Company are offering terms that
never before were offered on motor
cars, and at a rate of 6 per cent in­
terest, which is very enticing, should
one be in need of a little extra money
until fall for the balance of the pay­
ment of a car.
This is one of the most phenomenal
plans that has ever been put into exe­
cution and is certainly being taken
advantage of by a great many who
perhaps otherwise might be unable to
enjoy the use of a car this season.
THE CITY BEAUTIFUL.
Various phases of the "City Beauti­
ful" idea have been presented at the
meetings at the auditorium of the pub­
lic library recently. As a result of the
interest manifested in these discus­
sions a committee has been appointed
to consider ways and means for aid­
ing Minot's development in municipal
beauty.
The Civic Federation of Women's
Clubs is greatly interested in the mat­
ter and part of the committee consists
of members of that organization the
remainder of the Committee has been
chosen because of their interest and
experience in that line of work. As a
whole the committee may be said to
be very representative of the com­
munity. Mrs. H. Weinrebe is chair­
man, and the other members are Mrs.
E. S. Person, Orrin M. Pierce, Will O.
Doolittle, Mrs. T. J. Vincent and Mrs.
C. B. Davis.
A general line of action has been
mapped out, the details are being
worked out as rapidly as possible, and
at an early date this plan will be
ready to present to the community.
The committee promises something
interesting.

FIRST
SECTION
FOUR DEER DIED
AT WIUISTON
OTHERS CAPTURED BY GAME
WARDEN HAVE BEEN PLACED
IN A CORRAL MINOT WILL
GET TWO OF THEM.
Four of the ten deer which were
captured on the Missouri river near
Williston by Chief Game Warden Mc
Cutcheon and his deputies last week,
have died. The deer had evidently
injured themselves by falling on the
ice. The others have been placed in a
corral where they appear to be getting
along nicely.
Mr. McCutcheon had intended send­
ing four deer to Minot, but will prob­
ably send but two now. The park board
will get a doe from the state agricul­
tural college and the three elk that are
being shipped here from'the Yellow­
stone park will give Minot the ne
cleus of a splendid zoo.
The deer are attracting a good deal
of attention at Williston. A mass
meeting has been held and the citizens
hope to see established a state park
under the supervision of the fish and
game board.
One of the deer gave a pretty exhi­
bition in high jumping after being
placed in the corral. Not likinp- his
surroundings, he jumped over a seven
board fence into another corral occu­
pied by horses, but after viewing his
companions with alarm, sprang back
into the corral with the deer with
great ease.
Woman Would Enlist in Navy.
For the first time in the history of
the Minneapolis recruiting station, a
woman applied for enlistment in the
navy Thursday. She gave her name
as Mrs. Mamie Johnson, Williston, N.
D. "Women at this time should do
something for their country," she said,
"and I would like to join the navy as a
cook."
Peter Scott Tried for Perjury.
The case of the state vs. Peter
Scott, charged with perjury, went to
trial Wednesday. Scott was recently
convicted of pigging in county court.
He took the stand in his own defense
and swore that he had not sold liquor
to certain witnesses. He was defend­
ed by J. E. Burke and Mark M. Chat
field.
New Window Trimmer at McCoy's.
Harry Lenhoff, of Detroit, Mich, ar­
rived to accept a position as window
trimmer and show card writer at the
McCoy Department store. Mr. Len­
hoff has held responsible positions
with some of the largest department
stores in the east and comes to Minot
prepared to show this city some of the
classiest work of its kind to be seen
in the state.
CHURCHMEN SEEK AD. EXPERTS
Chicago, 111., March 15.—Churchmen
and advertising experts of Chicago
and neighboring cities got together
here. A few of their sayings follow:
"Advertising will make every church
a success."
"A good breakfast food ad. makes a
man hungry a goo dchurch ad. will
make him reverent."
"Every minister draws his salary as
an advertising man."
"The church bulletin board should
be large enough to give every pedes­
trian a punch in the eye."
CARL BARTLESON TO
BUILD HOSPITAL
MINOT CONTRACTOR GETS JOB
FOR $104,400 HEATING AND
PLUMBING WILL COST $25,000
MORE.
Carl Bartelson was the successful
bidder for the new hospital to be erect­
ed on North Mill street by the Sisters
of St. Francis.
When bids were opened by the arch­
itect, J. C. Woodruff, Bartelson's bid,
which was $104,400, was found to be
the lowest. This is exclusive of the
cost of the wiring, plumbing and
heating, which will bring the cost of
the structure up about $25,000 more.
The bid of D. A. Dinnie was $107,
571.00 Gray Construction Co., of
Watertown, S. D., $109,090.00 West­
ern Building Co., Minot, $115,590.00,
and W. J. Kirn of Valley City, $112,
625.00.
The new building will be one of the
finest in the state.
The Des Lacs lodge of Odd Fellows
came to Berthold this evening with
twelve applicants for membership in
this lodge. The Berthold lodge had
six applicants. The two lodges con­
ferred degrees upon the eighteen ap­
plicants. The local lodge served a
lunch at midnight to the visiting
lodge and their own members. There
were more than a hundred in attend­
ance. Dr. Halverson, Mr. Torgerson
of Des Lacs and Dr. Hillis, J. B. Feld
man and others of the local lodge re­
sponded to toasts. The Berthold lodge
will visit Des Lacs on the 30th.—^Ber­
