Orders going from Fort Sara Houston
today provide for rapid action at points

lion In Mexico make It necessary. Gen
eral Funston was'not altogether con
vinced of the truth of the report that
General Luis Herrera, tho reposed
military leader at Chihuahua had en
tered the Held with Villa against the
United States, but the repetition of
the report and absence of acceptable
evidence to the contrary ? caused the
General and staff to regard It as prob
ably true.
? The censorship imposed at EI Pasoi
by General Bell was done without or
ders from headquarters here, but- it
is known that General Bell has au
thority to go far in the exorcise of
his own Judgment in meeting an extra
ordinary situation. Staff officers of
General Funston - studied a more ex
tended' area o! northern Mexico today.
The"probablo moves of Herrora and
Ills 2,000 men were carefully consider
ed and'at every point along,tho bor
der note was taken of the position
of American troops and-tho time it
would-take to move them to meet any
