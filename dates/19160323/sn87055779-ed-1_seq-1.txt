Fire which burned all night and
still flamed up spasmodically, this

Three thousand people, most of

The names which originated in the
Dyer building elevator shaft of de

the business section first, the new
1.1-story Kmpire Lufe building, just
completed, being among the first to
go. The conflagration then swept
hoth newspaper plants, four banks,
both telegnfph ofllces and other
business places.
At i o'clock the firemen believed
the Mames were under control, but
shortly afterward they burst out
afresh, crossed Hroad St.. and swept
a row of cotton warehouses, in
which about $2,000.000 worth of
cotton furnished fuel that bu.ned so
rapidly that the firemen were again
helpless. The flames then ate their
way into the residence section, de
stroying everything in their path
until there was nothing left to feed
on.
Notwithstanding the tremendous
property damage there was no loss
of life. Several persons, however,
were slightly injuied, including Fire

SAYS BORDER PEOPLE
DON'T EXPECT VILLA'S
CAPTURE TO END FIGHT
No one living near the Mexican
border believes that the (rouble
now started is going to end with the
capture of Villa, according to A. O.
Gates, salesman for the Dodge Mfg.
Co. Mr. Gates is now in the south
west. In a letter written by him
on March 18 he says that while in
Columbus. N. M., he "saw burned
business houses, dead horses, the
place 'where we burned the bodies
of about 57 Mexican'. ' and a raft of
soldiers, mules, horses, and, in the
distance, the dust of vanishing wa
gon trains. While everything is
lovely on the surface nobody really
believes thinps are going to end with
the capture of Villa; they generally
believe we've started a job and we
have got to go through with it.
"It's rather odd, but people who
have been told that they were a
bunch of exploiters, thieves and
robbers because they did business
in Mexico or were trying to develop
mines there, don't talk today about
what they could make If Mexico
were straightened out. These peo
ple talk now about our duty to civ
ilization and that kind of altruistic
stuff; also how the first recruits
should be the four border states
where the men are acclimated and
know something of conditions.
Maybe some of the people along the
border here are the honest kind and
maybe those who were in Mexico
were really doing some good there
and to this country' and maybe,
after nil, they were not robbing: the
the people right and left."

SUPREME TEST
FOR CUM
lijRiie
De Facto Government Faces
Great Task in Keeping
Northern Forces From
Joining Villa Ranks.
CONGRESS AWAKENS TO
NEED FOR QUICK ACTION
Many Members Favor Immed
iate Passage of Volunteer
Bill But President's Wish
Causes Deliberation.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON, March 23. The
supreme test for the Carranzista de
facto government in Mexico has ar
rived. OJhcials declared today that
on his success in preventing a gen
eral desertion to Villa of his forces
in the north depends whether the
United States can continue its efforts
to cooperate with him. The fact
that Gen. Luis Herrera, with a force
estimated at 2,000 men, is reported
to have deserted and cast his lot
with Villa and his bandits, while
not in itself of supreme importance,
must inevitably have an intluence on
other Carranzista leaders. If the
"first chief" can hold them in line
he will greatly surprise ot'U ials who
know the Mexican characteristics.
The situation in Mexico today was
more serious than at any time since
the American landing at Vera Cruz
in 1914. Nearly every oillcial who
was In touch with developments in
sisted that coalition of the Carran
zistas and Villistas in Chihuahua
may tr.ke place at any time. Villa,
they say, has sent representatives to
every Carranza garrison calling upon
their f 5rces to join with him in driv
ing the Americans fronv Mexico
territory. Although the censorship
has been made more rigid by the
developments of the last 13 hours,
enough is filtering through to show
that Gen. Funston and his com
manders now- are preparing for real
war.
Will Need Reinforcements.
It is believed here that Funsion
has called for all of the troops in
the United States not already on the
border and they soon will be en
route to join him. Army officers say
that if Luis Herrera effects a junc
tion with Villa it will be necessary
to materially reinforce Gen. Persh
ing's punitive expedition. This will
make It necessary to utilize infantry
as practically all of the cavalry'
in use either with the main column
or at strategic points from which it
cannot be withdrawn.
Meanwhile there is a growing di.--position
evinced in conerress for
more speedy action. Many senators
and representatives favor the 1m
medite passage of the Sherman reso
lution v.-hich authorizes the president
to call for 50,00 0 volunteers. Prac
tically ill of the border state's sen
tors and representatives favor this
action, but up to the present the
wishes of the president that nothing
be done which might complicate the
situation are holding congress in
cheek.
However, Sen. Sherman announced
that he intended to press his resolu
tion for passage. He contends that
the Pershing expedition is too Inad
equate to do any good and that not
only should volunteers be authorized,
but that the president should also
mobilize the crack regiments of the
national guard and send them to re
lieve tbe regulars now acting as
border patrols so that the entire reg
ular army could be sent into Mex
ico. Kmba.sy Without Facts.
The Mexican embassy was with
out information regarding the move
ments of Lui.? Herrera. It was stated
that Herrera was relieved of his
commar.d abmit a month ago and
that no information was available
as to the number of his followers.
Most of the latter, it was admitted,
were former Villista soldiers. The
form of the protocol between the
two nat.ons has been agreed on be
tween Acting Sec'y of State Polk
and Ambassador-Designate Arre
dondo and the latter has telegraphed
the agreement to Carranza. As soon
as the latter approves it, officials
say, it will be signed and made pub
lic. IIITrtHnilA IS "FLIGHTY."
