And sunshine in the yield ;
A horn of plenty flowing o'er,
And many kingdoms worth--,,
Most blessed of all gifts to man
. The laughter of the earth. ' ;
Ah, the grapes in purple clusters,
And the glowing ears of corn, ,
Pears and peaches ; plums and apples,
Tumbling out from Plenty's horn ; - .
Rounded melons, friendly squashes ;
Pumpkins with their generous girth ;
, Yield of many fields and orchards,
Blessed laughter of the earth.
There's the laughter of the tropics,
Sultry laughter, langor-laden, - i
. Like the laughter of aNile girl, or
A perfumed Spanish maiden ; .
. Golden pomegranates, oranges ; 4
Plump fruits of sunny birth ; V
Jewejp of unending summer,; v ;
Sleepy laughter of the earth.
