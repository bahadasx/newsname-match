ASKS MORE FOR P. 0. STATION
Co-Op, With $3,000 Postal Business,
Seeks $2"0 Appropriation.
The postal department is to be
asked for more money for the main
tenance of the sub-station in the Uni
versity Co-Operatlve Store as a result
of the action taken at a meeting of
the board of directors ot the store
yesterday. The sub-station is at pres
ent making about one-fifth of the total
stamp sales of the Columbia postof
fice, the receipts during the past year
amounting to about $S,000.
Under the present plan, the postal
department pays less than $100 an
nually for the maintenance of this
sub-station. The sum to be asked for
is $230. One of the store clerks
handles all the stamp sales, and the
time required of this clerk has become
so great that the directors feel justi
fied in asking for an increase in the
appropriation.

HEALTH ORDINANCE
FOR CITlfPROPOSEO
Rev. A. W. Taylor Outlines
Plan at the Commercial
Club Luncheon.
MAYOR LIKES IDEA
Would Create Inspector, and
Board With Power to
Condemn Nuisances.
A city health ordinance creating a
salaried sanitary inspector and a
board of health with more authority
than the present board was suggested
to tlie Commercial Club at Its noon
day luncheon today by the Rev. A. W.
Taylor, representing the Civic Iaguo
and the Charity Organization Society.
The ordinance which was drawn up
by It C. Journey of the University is
modeled on similar health ordinances
in other cities. Mayor J. M. Batter
ton, who was present when the or
dinance was explained to the club.
said that the need of some change in
the health regulations ot Columbia
was felt and that he thought the City
Council would be glad to incorporate
the suggestions of the proposed or
dinance in the present health laws.
President L. M. Defoe of the Com
mercial Club named a committee of
live to consult with the lawyers who
are revising all the city ordinances
and to present a health ordinance to
the council. The members of the com
mittee are J. K. McPherson, chairman;
W. C. Knight, J. P. Hetzler, the Rev.
M. A. Hart and N. T. Gentry.
"We are not so anxious that the or
dinance be passed as drawn up, but
there are two important features that
the Civic league feels Columbia
should have," said Mr. Taylor in ex
plaining the proposed law. "One ot
these is a paid sanitary inspector
responsible for the execution of the
health rules. The police can't do
this; they haven't the time.
"The other thing is the creation of
a board of health similar to the one
we now have, but with the additonal
power to declare a thing a nuisance.
The inspector would be subject to this
board and with the executive power
given the board the sanitary condition
of the city would be definitely im
proved." TWO TONS OF CATALOGUES HERE
.Mail Order House Advertising Floods

Two tons ot catalogues from Sears

ties, telling wliat part students from
their counties have played in the ac
tivities ot the year at the University.
"It is best to avoid emphasizing the
social side ot Uniiersity life," said G.
B. Iong, president of the Ad Club,
"because some people might get the
mistaken idea that young people come
to the University iiierely to have a
good time. The story should empha
size the actual work that is being done
during the year. It might tell, for ex
ample, of the men and women who are
working their way through school, and
the different methods by which they
accomplish this. In general, an j thing
that will help to advertise the Uni
versity truthfully will be acceptable."
The winner or the contest will re
ceive the $3 within ten days after the
decision of the judges. His or her
name will be published in the MIs
sourian. Mr. Long says that, judging
from the number of students who have
inquired about the contest, he expects
a number of good stories to be contributed.

MILITIAMEN MAY BE

Iiy Putted l'res.
WASHINGTON, March 23.
The calling out of national
guardsmen to patrol the border
line between Mexico and the
United States is being seriously
considered by President Wilson
and Secretary of War Baker, It
was learned this afternoon.

When the order will be issued

may not be necessary.
31. U. GIRLS TO STUDY SUFFRAGE
Local Organization May Affiliate With
National Association.
The Woman's Equal Suffrage
League, organized by University wom
en two years ago, is planning reor
ganization and affiliation with the Na
tional College Equal Suffrage League.
A meeting will be held April 4, with
Miss Alice Arnold as chairman, to
consider the matter.
The proposed reorganization is the
result ot a communication from the
executive secretary ot the national
league, Mrs. Ethel Puffer Howes, re
ceived by Miss Eva Johnston, adviser
of women.
"The national college association
aims to organize college and univer
sity women into chapters for the
study of equal suffrage," said Miss
Johnston today. "The purpose is edu
cational and not political. It is for
both pros and antis, the decided and
undecided. Women should interest
themselves in this vital question, no
matter what their beliefs are concern
ing it."
The college league has hitherto been
an independent organization, but the
plan now Is to make it a part of the
chain of chapters which the national
body is establishing in the larger
women's colleges and the state uni
versities. It is also affiliated with
the National American Equal Suffrage
League. Dues of not more than 25
cents a year are paid to the latter
organization. Both bodies will fur
nish literature and speakers should
a chapter be organized here.
Among the well-known women who
are officers in the league are Dr. N.
Carey Thomas, president of Bryn
Mawr, who is president of the national
association; Dr. Anna Howard Shaw,
Miss Sophonisba P. Breckenbrldge,
Miss Lucy M. Salmon of Vassar and
Miss Mary E. Woolley of Holyoke.

I'.y I'nlteil I'resn.
EL PASO, Tex., .March 23 In the
absence ot any denial or the revolt ot
General Luis Herrera, former military
governor of Chihuahua under Carran
za, the news of his joining the forces
of Villa with 2,000 troops is generally
credited here today. General Herrera
has often flopped from one faction to
another.
The reported defection or the 2,000
Carranza men to the support ot the
outlawed Villa overshadowed this at
ternoon the report that the United
States troops had taken over the
Mexican-Northwestern Railroad to
speed up the man hunt
Indications are that General Persh
ing took over the use ot the line with
the consent ot the Carranza oHiclals.
It is also unofficially reported that
the United States will use the line to
transport both supplies and men over
the border within the next twenty
four hours.
Funston Doesn't Deny Report
Ity United Press.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., March 23.
General Frederick Funston said this
afternoon that it was possible that the
Mexican-Northwestern Railroad had
been taken over by General Pershing,
but that he had not received any of
ficial notice of the seizure from the
general.
ANNOUNCES FLOWER SHOW
Prof. 3Iajor Urges Columbians to Co
operate in Exhibit
Prof. II. F. Major addressed the
Parent-Teachers Association at the
Lee School this afternoon on play
ground work and summer gardens for
the children of Columbia. Mr. Major
also announced the annual state flow
er show which is to be held In con
nection with the eleventh annual
Farmers' Fair, Friday, May 5. One
hundred dollars in cash prizes is of
fered to professional and amateur
classes. All the citizens of Columbia
and especially the children of the
schools are urged to enter their
house plants and table decorations
in the amateur classes. Particulars
of the awards will be furnished upon
application to C. B. Gray at the Horti
cultural Building.
"There is great need for wholesome
out-of-door amusement for the chil
dren and young people of Columbia,"
continued Mr. Major, "and the play
ground is a great step In this direc
tion. It is still my ambition, how
ever, to see Columbia located on a
large lake which will afford boating
and aquatic sports for older as well
as younger Columbians.
"The logical place is the flat land
east and south of town, lying on either
side of the Hlnkson. By building a
dam ot moderate height a body ot wa
ter from four to six miles in extent
and nearly a mile in width could be
afforded. Such a dam could be con
structed for a cost similar to the
bonus raised for a hotel."
