Committee on resolutions re
port read by J.W.Key, chairncan,
and unanimously adopted as
follows: , , r
We, the Republicans of Wright
Conuty, in convention assembled,
renew our allegiance to the time
honored principles of the party
that has always stood for the
protection of Americans at home
and abroad the party that en
courages prosperity at horne
rather than Free Tr,ade with
foreign countries.
We have noted the vacillating
policy of the Wilson administra
tion with regret and disgust, and
believe that his ability to get on
all sides of all questions will in
volve the United States in a for
eign war. . -
Language is inadequate to ex
press our feelings toward the
Major state administration.Their
efforts to loot the state school
fund and their ability to make
places in the state departments
and state institutions for rela
tives of state officers cause us to
pledge ourselves to use all honor
able means to help consign this
bunch of official parasites to pri
vate life at the coming November
election.
We are proud of the record of
Hon. C, H. Skinker as circuit
judge aud urge him to staud for
re election. . -
We endorse Hon. H. S. Hadley
and Hon. Jacob L'.Babler for del
egates at large to the National
Convention; L. J. Ellis as one of
the delegates to the National
Convention from this congres
MINES LOOK GOOD
So Says H. E. Gabriel of
Thayer, Assistant Fris-
co Superintendent
That many mines far superior
to some now being worked in the
long recognized mining districts
exist in the vicinity of Mansfield
was'the opinion expressed last
week by H E. Gabriel of Thayer,
assistant superintendent of the
Southern division of the Frisco,
who was here on business with
G. S. Burney, local agent for the
company. Mr. Gabriel was very
favorably impressed with what
he saw of the mining industry
here, and an effort is being made
to interest the department of de
velopment of the Frisco in the
vast undeveloped mineral re
sources of this district.
A. T. Friend,' Sam Ervin and
Charles Bly expect to put in a
jig at their mines and ship some
ore soon.

SOME SCHOOL NEWS
The Senior-Junior Reception
and Other Notes of
General Interest
It St. Patrick could have seen
the students and" teachers in
high school with the masques
they wore at "the Senior-Junior
reception Friday evening, he
would have concluded that the
world Had gone topsy-turvy in
deed since he lived in it. Invita
tions were required at the door
and it was well tbey were, for
even their mothers would not
have known the youngsters in
the garb they wore. Some stu
dents were not able to figure out
even their own classmates until
mas'ques were removed. The
hall was beautifully decorated
and lighted so that every feature
of it was shown up to the very
best advantage. Blarney Castle
was represented so perfectly
that' some of the youngsters
thought they could actually climb
to the kissing stone. In Dublin
Bay, through the kindness of
Frank Beach, was placed an ele
gant grafmola and as the guests
approached St. Patrick's land
beautiful strains ;f Irish melo
dies greeted, them and lent a pe
culiar charm to the scene. Cecil
Brazeal and Herve Coday, presi
dents of their respective classes,
were masters of ceremonies and
did their full share to make the
evening a delightful one for all
present. After masques had
been removed and each one knew
who the other was a series of
contests were given one of which
was to write one part of a tele
phone conversation when the
other side was heard. Velma
Hylton and Hazel Burney ( were
the winners and were informed
that they had the reputation of
sehd'mg'miVch-tttne at tbe'phone
Prof. J. A. Hylton was given a red
bandanna for making the most
words out of the lecters in St
Patrick. Delicious refreshments
were served, the last course con
taining bricks of ice cream with
a green shamrock design in the
center. Music and games, new
and old, were enjoyed until a late
or rather early hour without in
terruption except when Jeff and
Mutt would occasionally get into
a dispute which required the
services of the policeman to set
tle it. The characters represent
ed by the masques were surpri
sing for the variety they showed,
not more than two persons se
lecting the same type. Wade
Rippee was an excellent circus
clown, Mintie Avery and Alice
Tombleson were typical gypsies,
Mabel Coday with her shepherd's
crook was Little Bo Peep, Cecil
Brazeal and Ruth Hoover pro
trayed the negro character, Mr.
Hylton represented the 12th cen
tury knight in full armor, Opal
Hoover and Ollie Chance were
fine types of 10-year-old girls,
Mabel Hoover was perfectly dis
guised as a rustic lass on her
first visit to town, Herve Coday
was a fine specimen of the Amer
ican soldier, Lois Beach was a
real little Red Riding Hood, Wil
da Stephens looked like a lassie
from Scotland.Nora Ross typified
the Irish colleen, Jasper Craig
.was mutter than Mutt himself
and Ben Grover was more natur
al as Jeff than he is as Ben. The
best representation of the list
was probably Clelland Hitchcock
as policeman. He not only looked
like a cup but he acted like one.
VeliDa Hylton was good as Bar
bara Worth, Hazel Burney and
Earl Cauble made quite good In
dians, Sidney Grantham was a
real porter, Lclah Cole had a per
fect makeup for a nun, Lockie
Craig was a cute Buster Brown,
Irmey Kennedy made an excel
lent Dutch girl, Charley Chaplin
was taken on well by Roy Nor
cross, Lucile Short was made to
do service as a Red Cross nurse,
Grace Craig was liite Miss Muf
fet, Pearl Newton a dainty look
ing nurse, Frank Hoover was a
tine looking sailor lad and Miss
Osborn in sailor cap and 'teen age
girl dress was perfectly . dis
gnised to most people until the
masques were taken off. It was
a most enjoyable event and the
guests are grateful indeed to the
senior and juniors for the many
pleasures of the evening. A

HERE, MR. FARMER!
Why Not Grow a Few Acres
of Tomatoes? Have You '
Thought About It?
.Or maybe you tried it once and
for some reason it was not as big
a success as you expected and
you decided not to fool with to
matoes again. , , .
Is that the way you reason and
plan in regard to other crops,
stock and all your farm enter
prises? You know you don't fol
low that principle with corn,
wheat, oats, potatoes, live stock,
etc. O, if you do, that tells the
story of why you are not as suc
cessful as some of your neigbors
and want to quit farming and do 1
something else.
If you have made good at farm
ing or any ' other busines you
know that you have done so by
persistent endeavor in spite of
failures," discouragements and
backsets. . .
Now, I want you to consider a
few plain statements of facts in
regard to the growing of toma
toes for canning:
First Wherever tomato grow
ing has been fairly tried
here in the Ozarks it has become
an established teature or ine
farming in that community and
in many localities has become
the leading or main crop.
Second It is a sure crop, not '
that it is immune to plant dis
eases, weatner extreme1? or in
sect ravages but that in a given
number of years in spite of these ;
hindrances it produces more ull
crops and even in bad seasons
seldom fails to produce aayfggr
crop. . ..
Third -The selling price of
your crop is not aepenaent on
the uncertain changes of a uxn-
ipuM-cd market under; the-con -
trcif of buyers! auuwoften. ;or3
to the lowest level just when the"
farmer is compelled to let go.
With tomatoes the price is fixed
by contract before the crop is
planted.
Fourth At 40c per 100 pounds
any land that will grow even a
fair crop of corn will yield i40 to
$80 per acre in tomatoes.
The facts above stated are our
main reasons for trying to estab
lish tomato canning as a perma
nent industry at Mansfield
Last year's exceptional and al
most complete failure of tho crop
has not discouraged us and we
propose to go right on with prep
arations for handling the largest
crop of tomatoes ever grown in
this locality. .
To do this we in ust have the
interest and cooperation of our
farmer friends.
Won't you be one to help us
make this the banner year for
tomato growing and canning in
this locality?
Last year the R and E Kanning
Ko. of Mansfield made every
promise good and met every ob
ligation of their contracts with
the growers without shirking or
whining at poor quality of toma
toes. We gave the growers fair
aud liberal treatment even in the
face of certain loss to ourselves.
All that we ask now is that the
farmers give the tomato propo
sition a fair trial. Let us have
at least 100 acres this year and
with a good season this acreage
will put at least $4000 or $5000 in
the pockets of the farmers, fur
nish needed employment to a
number of people and put this
enterprise on a safe basis.
It is time now for you to look
over your farm and decide how -
much ground you can tend in to
matoes. Come in and sign up a .
contract and get your seed at W.
B. Fullington's. We want all -
contracts signed up by April 10.
