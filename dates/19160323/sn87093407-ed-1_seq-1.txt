Seattle friend* of the Bremerton

tlon-wide conspiracy exists, plainly
fostered by th# shipbuilding trust,
to prevent government building of
battleships.
The plot Is being helped In Sen
tie aa veil aa In other parts of the
state by certain men who have
selfish motives for so doing, they
say.
No one ever seriously believed
Astoria la entitled to conaidersttnn
ss a naval base, with navy yards si
ready established at Bremerton snd
at Mare Island.
Yet Astorls Is looming up thru
out the nation, by the aid of a pub
licity fund, aa a possible contender.
Who Furnishes ths Cash?
There Is some curiosity ss to the
source of the money being expend
ed to give Astoria so much pub
licity.
The convention at Spokane has
t»«>n called by the Columbia naval
haie committee of Astoria, and the
same number of delegatea are al

REGULAR ARMY BUSY
BV ROBERT J. BENDER
U. P. Staff Correspondent
WASHINGTON, March 23.—
For the first time tinea Villa
started his border raiding, th«
government today seriously
considered the possibility of
militia forces being a necessity
on the border.
Every available regular may
be needed to cope with the
Villieta field forcea when they
are reinforced by destt-tifiQ
Carranxlstas.
If the entire regular army bor
der force marched Into Mexico, It
Is believed President Wlleon would
have to call rrllltla or volunteers
to guard the line.
As far as Secretary Baker's ad
vices show. Americana in Mextcv -
have not fired a single shot, end
there had been no soldiera killed
since the expedition marched from
Columbus.
Maker did not deny he la consid
ering calling the mliitla.
Hesldc* almost all of the coun
try's mobile army already either la
Mexico or on the border, the gov
ernment still has Its Coast artillery.
Philippine and Alaska forces end
several thousand marines that
could be used In an emergency.
The protocol under which opera
tion* against Villa are to be con
ducted awaits Carranxa'a approval
today.
MaJ. On. Fred Funston reported
ss entirely unauthentlcated the
story of General Herrera and
2,000 men going over to Villa, but
officials admitted the situation pre
