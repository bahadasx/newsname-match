Children Cry
FOR FLETCHER'S
CASTORIA
To the Sweet Memory of E. B.
Buckingham by His
Children '
HomeMs now bereft and lonely,
There's a face we cannot see,
Tis the face of dear old father,
Gone to spend eternity eternity.
Today, dear father, we are so
sad and ill,
Yet humbly we bow to the good
Master's will,
We know you are happy and you
wanted to go,
While we' are so sad, and we
miss you so.
We know you are there with the
Angels so dear,
Singing the songs that you so
loved to hear,
You are happy with Jesus, Peter
and Paul,
For we stood by your bed and
- heard you talk to them all.
Father, dear "father, how did we
know
That you'd be the first among us
to go?
For you were ihe link that held
us together,
In sunshine and rain and all
sorts of weather.
Father, O father, me miss your
sweet face,
We miss your dear form all over
the place.
We look in the garden, thinking
you're there,
We look on the porch in the old
i rocking chair.
But we find it so empty there's
no father there,
And we always will cherish the
old rocking chair,
And we love the brass cot where
you rested so much,
We love everything that you
ever did touch.
Dear old feeble mother, Oh!
she misses you too,
In every nook and corner she's
looking for you,
She misses your kiss and kindly
voice,
She weeps at your going but
the angels rejoice.
Our weeping and looking and
sorrowing so,
Will not bring you back, dear
father, we know, ,
But how can we help it? 0, we
- wish that we knew.
With all our devotion God loved
you too, (and called you
home.) v
Our own, absent father, we have
sorrows to bear,
While you are so happy with the
Savior up there. '
You will not come back to this
sinful old earth,
But spend eternity in heaven,
among glad songs and mirth.
We are glad that you are happy
up there with the throng,
For you bore your, suffering,
heroic and long,
And we fancy we see in the
mystic beyond,
The hand of the Savior leading
you on.

Calomel Today,
Sick Tomorrow
Dose of nasty calomel makes you
sick and you lose a
day's work
Colomel salivates! It's mercury,
Calomel acts like dynamite on a slug
gish liver. When calomel comes into
com ant with sour bile it crashes into
it. causing cramping and nausea..
If you (eel bilious, headachy, con
stipated and all knocked out, just so
to your druggist and get a 50 cent
bottle of Dodson's Liver Tone, which
is a harmless vegetable substitute for
dnngt'rous calomel. Take? a spoonful
and if it dosen t start your liver and
straighten you up .better and quicker
than nasty calomel and without mak
ing you sick, you just go back and
get your money.
If you take calomel today you'll be
be sick and nauseated tomorrow; be
sides, it may salivate you, while if you
lake Dodson's Liver Tone you will
wake up feeling great, full of ambition
and ready for work or play. It's
harmless, pleasant and safe to give to
c'lildren; they like it. adv.
