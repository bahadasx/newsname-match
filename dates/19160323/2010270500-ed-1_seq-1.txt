Sioux City Journal, 21: Elmer
Johnson, about 23 years old, of South
Sioux City, was brought to Sioux
City yesterday from Cherokee, where
he was arrested on a charge of tak
ing part in the theft of the automo
bile of A. L. Olson. 1220 Jones street.
iHe was arrested by Sheriff W. A.
Huber, of Cherokee county, who had
set traps for the tl. ves at Cherokee,
Larrabee and Storm Lake, acting on
clues furnished by Clarence Fessler,
a Larrabee garage man. Olson's
auto was taken from the curb at
the Orpheum theater, March 10.
The Sioux City police were notified,
but were unable to locate the car
or thieves' A machine with three
occupants became "stalled" five
miles north of Larrabee, March 11.
Fessler was called and pulled the car
to his garage. It was left there for
repairs. Both gasoline and oil had
been exhausted. Subsequently, a
man said to be Johnson telephoned
Fessler from Storm Lake, asking
him to drive the car to Cherokee.
In the meantime, through Sheriff
Huber, the machine had been identi
fied and turned over to Olson.
When Johnson arrived in Cherokee
he was arrested. He denied con
nection with the car theft, but was
identified by Fessler as one of the
three men whom he hauled to the
garage. Duncan Campbell, of
Cherokee, also asserted that Johnson
was one of the trio which boarded
the train after the auto was aban
doned. A bunch of fourteen auto
mobile keys of different makes was
found in Johnson's pocket. A re
volver was also found, and a charge
of carrying a concealed weapon is
being held in abeyance at Cherokee,
pending action against the prisoner
here on the more serious charge.
Belief was expressed by the author
ities at Cherokee that the car was
being taken by the thieves to some
"fence." ... .At a mass meeting of the
liberal voters of South Sioux City
last evening, Mayor C. J. Kloster
announced his intention of not seek
ing reellection and former Council
man A. B. Cownio was named to
head the ticket as his successor. Mr.
Cownie accepted the nomination and
declared his intention to make a vig
orous campaign. H. A. Phillips will
be the liberal candidate for city
clerk. The "wets" selected the fol
lowing as candidates for ward coun
cilmen: First ward, Fred A. Gor
don; Second ward, Carl Jensen;
Third ward, John Jenkens. Council
man Fred Martin, who presided at
the meeting, declined to be a candi
date for reelection. All of these
candidates will file nomination pa
pers in the usual way, the law re
quiring that they be in the hands of
the city clerk ten days before the
election, which will be held on April
4. The liberal candidates in a ten
tative platform outlined at the meet
ing will go before the voters as op-

Mogul 8-1 6 Saves Its OwnPrice
In Fuel Bill Reduction
'"pHAT'S true. A Mogul 8-16 kerosene tractor
saves its own price in fuel bill saving, as com
pared with a gasoline tractor.
Until April IsS he price remains at $675 cash-,
f. o. b. Chicago. Fortunate early purchases of ma-
,terial still allow you this low figure. After April 1st
the price will be $725, same terms.
At either price the Mogul 8-16 is by far the most eco
nomical tractor because it operates on cheap, common kero
sene or coal oil. Gasoline to run the gasoline tractor costs
over 100 per cent more than the kerosene a Mogul 8-16
will use. Which is best for you?
You know what gasoline costs you, and you know what
you pay for kerosene. Figure it out yourself, or see your
dealer. This is a saving you can't afford to miss.

will sell only in original packages.
They state in the platform that they,

$15,000 annually, will enable the city
to make many needed improvements.
It is pointed out that at present the
school district has a debt of $45,000,
and the city a debt pf $45,000. The
"dry" forces will support D. G.
Evans for mayor, O. W. Martin for
city clerk, J. H. Mullins for city
treasurer and W. H. Bradford for
city engineer. The "drys" have se

candidates: First ward, E. O. Men

Third ward, Ed J. Metz. Neither
of the factions will name a 'candi

took his first ride in a seaplane. In
formation concerning Dr. J3artlett's
flight .was received yesterday in a
letter to Mrs. Bartlett. According
to the letter Dr. Bartlett and his
sister, Mrs. Abbio Young, were vis
iting friends at Long Beach. 'An
aviator was giving exhibition flights
near where they were staying. He
had been in the air for some time,
and as hi- .escended one of the party
dared L Hartlett to go for a fly.
When the plane reached the earth
the aviator agreed to take the doc
tor up. Dr. Bartlett in his letter
said he put on an aviator's coat and
climbed into the car. He did not
know how high they went, but said
that the land and buildings became
indistinguishable. . . .A new top price
for this year to date was established
on the local fat cattle market yes
terday morning when seventeen head
of prime steers, averaging 1,850
pounds, crossed the scales for $9.50,
or a quarter above the year's pre
vious high mark. Fourteen heifers
also were included in the consign
ment that were good enough to sell
at $8.10, right up to the season's
snmmat price on such cattle, while
cows commanded $7.uu. Larsen
Bros., stock raisers of Hubbard,
Neb., marketed the cattle. Hans
Larsen accompanied the shipment.
Their entire cattle holdings are
Herefords. The steers here today
had been in the feed yards on a ra
tion of corn and alfalfa since last
October, although the heifers and
cows had not fed quite that long.
During the period on feed all of the
cattle made big gains in weight.
Mr. Larson assorted, while the sale
was highly satisfactory C. J.
Kloster, mayor of South Sioux City,
was renominated last evening at a
mass meeting of the liberal voters of
the city. Ho will head a ticket fa
j voring the granting of liquor, licen-

tend that the dry period in the town
will expire May 1. 'Under the Btate

for the return of license have agreed
to compromise the question by stip
ulating that only wholesale establish
ments may be reopened. By the'
Clay, the lawlessness and undeaira

eliminated, and at the same time
the business interests of the town
are given an opportunity to profit
by a wholesale business, they say.
