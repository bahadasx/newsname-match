El Paso, March 2:3. Rumors
of a revolution among- Carran
zista troops against co-operation
in the pursuit of Villa, their old
loader, were supplanted today by
the report that the American ex
pedition has taken over the Mex
ican railways to speed up the
man hunt.
Indications that the step was tak
en with the consent of the de facto
government were seen in the report
that Colonel Hertai i with -'00 mi'ii left
asas Grandes today on a military
train for Madera. Hrigadier General
PershinK took charge of the Mexic
Northwestern from Casas Grandes to
Madera three days ago, it became
known today. The. action was kept
secret until today
Did Villa Escape?
If American infantry were moved to
Madera, mm reported, they must now
be south of Villa, although the ab
sence of any information as to his
whereabouts leads to the belief that
he has escaped the trap.
It was also unofficially reported
that the 1'nited States army would be
gin the operation of provision trains
on the Mexico Northwestern from
.Juarez within he next twenty-four
hours.
Final negotiations were in progress
today for American railroad equip
ment to be used over the Mexican line.
In the local yard, preparation were
being marie to turn over cars and loco
motives to the army.

The transportation of heavy army
supplies over the Chih uah ua desert
and mountains for distance oJ nearly
200 miles by automobile and wogan
trains became impracticable. How
the privilege of using the Mexican rail
roads was" obtained is not known here
outside of army circles.
With telegraph and railway commu
nication intact, the absence of official
denial of Luis Herrera's revolt at Chi
huahua City was generally credited
here.
The rumored defection of Colonel
Cano and 900 Carranzista troop? who
were in touch with Villa last Monday,
while stiU unconfirmed, was also gen
erally believed in the absence of offi

Without orders from headquarters
here, but it is known that General Kell

of his own judgment in meetng an
extraordinary situation.
Staff officers of General Funston
studied a more extended area of north
ern Mexico today. The probable moves
of Herrera and his 2.000 men were
carefully considered and at every
point along the border where they
might disturb the peace of those on
the American side careful note was
taken of the positions of American
troops and the time it would take to
get them to the scene.
Will Harass Pmhlag.
That phase of the situation did not
alarm the army officers, however, who
beiieved that if Herrera really has re
volted that his activities will be con
fined to operations that have for their
object the strengthening of Villa's
bands and the harassing of General
i'ershing's force. It was feared that
me of his earlier moves would be the
cutting of the Northwestern railway
over which General Funston hopes to
receive permission to move supplies to
the American troops, now almost 200
miles into Mexico. To prevent this
move General Funston is powerless
and it is doubted if t'arranza's troops
are in position to oppose ljerrera.
Reports at headquarters that Gen
eral Gavlra's garrison at Juarez was
about to revolt and that the troops at
Torreon were manifesting disaffection
were regarded with apprehension at
the fort. The Mexican consul here
continued to deny their truth and re
erated his assertion that Herrera

Alleging that the Leavenworth and j

Leavenworth and Meriden, is insolvent
and that its deficit is becoming
larger every year, R. W. Blair, gen
eral attorney for the Union Pacific,
today filed a petition in the United (

Financial Difficulties.
In the petition asking for a receiver,
t he financial difficulties of the road
are recounted in detail. Since Novem
ber 8, 1900, $250,000 in bonds issued
by the Leavenworth and Topeka have
been received and held jointly by the
Union Pacific and the Atchison, To- ,
peka ana Santa p e, according to the
petition. From the beginning, the L.
& T. was unable to meet its running
expenses and the Union Pacific and
Santa Fe jointly met the deficits. Fol
lowing acquisition of all L. & T. bonds
in payment for loans, the two roads
accepted notes from the Leavenworth
and Topeka. Notes accepted by the

creased from $21,222 in 1909 to more
than $35.ou0 in 1915, the petition re
cites. U. P. Refused Money.
The first direct step that has result
ed in the petition asking for the ap- :
pointment of a receiver was made last j
January when the Union Pacific an- i
nounced that it would refuse to ad-
vance any more money to keep the j
Leavenworth and Topeka a going con-
cern. Following closely on the Union :
Pacific's refusal to lend the road more i
money came a similar announcement
from the Santa Fe. The road was
consequently left stranded without a
cent in its treasury and without a bor
rowing source, according to the peti
tion. The refusal of the Union Pacific to
advance more money to meet the de
ficits of the road followed immedi
ately after an order by the Public
Utilities commission directing the
Leavenworth & Topeka to add to its
service between Leavenworth and To
peka an extra passenger train.
According to the petition filed by I
the Union Pacific today, the total I
equipment of the Leavenworth & To- :
peka railway consists of one locomo
tive, one combination baggage and ex- ;
press car, one passenger coach and
one flat car. For some time it has
; been operating a mixed train between !
its terminals. To add another passen-
ger train would necessitate the rnir-
chase of additional equipment costing I
at least $25,000 dollars in addition to
a further annual deficit that the
Union Pacific claimed would be added
to the roads burdens.

Official reports concerning the sani
tary condition of state schools and in
stitutions are to be withheld from the
public. That is the action of the state
board of health as announced today
by Secretary S. J. Cruinbine.
This week the state board of health
met in Topeka. The members discuss
ed conditions at several state schools
and charitable institutions. Official
reports covering bad sanitary condi
tions in these institutions were filed
by the board. Then, that the public
might not know the true conditions
of state property, the board adopted
a rule which forbade the publication
of the report. Dr. Crumbine today
refused to give out copies of the re
ports or to discuss their contentp.
Recently the state board Df health
began an investigation of sanitary
conditions at all of the state institu
tions. The investigation will cover the
big state schools, penitentiary, re
formatory, industrial schools and state
hospitals. Conditions In several of
these institutions are said to be de
plorable. In some of the institutions,
it was recently reported. sleeping
quarters are wo crowded that men and
women are compelled to sleep on the
floor. Ancient systems of ventilation
are observed in some of the state in
stitutions and health conditions among
inmates are said to be far from com
mendable. Conditions at K. F.
In the state university at Lawrence,
it was recently stated that students
were compelled to climb five flights
of stairs to certain class rooms. These
rooms are at all times artificially
lighted. Sanitation in some of the
schools is also bad. according to in
dependent reports.
Official statements covering the ex
act conditions in these institutions are
now in the hands of state officers. But
relatives of students or inmates of
state institutions can learn nothing of
the lacts.
Recently the state board of health
gave to the press the name of a Wich
ita man who owned a butcher shop
and kept meat in an unsanitary refrigerator-
Newspapers were urged to
give the widest possible publicity to
the story that the moral effect might
aid a campaign for better health con
ditions. In the matter of the state's
own institutions, though, no informa
tion is to be given.
It Is a Board Rule.
"The board has adopted a rule not
to give out these reports and I cannot
violate the rule." said Dr. Crumbine.
"Reports will be sent to heads of the
institutions affected and to the boards
which have supervision."
One of the institutions said to have
been mentioned in the report is the
state orphans' home at Atchison.
Nearly 200 homeless boys and girls are
inmates of the institution. Sanitary'
conditions in the home are said to be
deplorable. Other institutions are
covered by the report. Secretary
Crumbine. however, would give the
names of none of them.
In 1915 the state legislature mad
direct appropriation of $69,000 for the
handling of the affairs of the stall
board of health. The money is used
by the state board largely as it deem
fit. L'nder the order now in effect it
will give the taxpayers only such in
formation as it desires published.

El Paso, March 23. Panel
Villa has established a base to
the westward of Namaquipa to
re-organize his command and re
cruit new men for his army, is
a report current today. At this
new base, it was said Villa would
lay his plans to operate with the
force of General Luis Herrera
who is understood to have re
nounced the defacto government.
The American army base at Col
umbus has had no news of Villa
for over two days. So far Gen
eral Pershings forces have not
come into contact with the out
law and his band.
Gen. Luis Herrera. until a few day
ago in command of the Carrajiza gar
rison, is said to be moving northwest
ward to affect a juncture with Villa,
and this, in connection with the report
that the Carranza garrison at Torreon
had revolted, has occasioned grave
concern among the American army of
ficers in Kl Paso.

Villa's men. augmented by the com

number 2.000 well equipped soldlera,
might be in a position to harass Gen

between the advanced base of A mer$-

An early a greement with t he Car
ranza government for the permission
to use Mexican railway lines is greatly
desired by army officers.
Th- main base would then be trans
ferred from Columbus to this city and
the Mexico Northwestern railway
could be used to ship men and sun
plies to Casas Grandes. The railroad
could be easily maintained against in
terruption while the present line
southward out of Columbus over a
desert might readily be cut should
Villa recruit a formidable body of
