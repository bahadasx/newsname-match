A large part of tlie forces of tlie de

their onuers, have followed the ban

Tlie troops under Herrera are de
scribed here as being probablv tlie

are said to be well supplied with am
munition. Luts Herrera at one time
was one ol Villas most active aides,

VIOLENT ARTILLERY BOMBARDMENTS]
ARE FOLLOWED BY INFANTRY ATTACKS
Infantry attacks northwest of Ver-1
dun, preceded by a vigorous bombard-1
tuent, have enabled the Germans to
gain a foothold on the small hill of j
Haucourt, which lies Just outside the
village of Malancourt and between
that town and the eastern edge of the
Malancourt wood. An entire sector;
of about 2 1-2 miles from the Avo
court wood to Malancourt has been
subjected to a violent prtillery bom
Imrdment and several German inl'an
trv attacks. Iflit except in the imme-1
diate vicipity of Malancourt the Oer
mans were held by tlie French barrier
lire and were unable to advance.
-
Northeast of Verdun, around Douau
mont and Vaux, an intense artillery
bombardment is still in progress. The
infantry forces, however, have re
nmined inactive in this district.
From the west in the forest of the
Argonne the kYeneli are heavily shell

the hands of tlie Germans, and at var-1
