Work of County Agriculturist
The pruning and grafting demon
strations constituted the main line of
work taken up last week. Although
the weather was somewhat severe dur
ing the entire time, it did not seem to
cool the ardor of the fruit men for in
formation regarding the care of their
orchards. At each of the farms of
Alvin Balden near .Cupar, and George
Heuge of St. Clair thirty-five men were
present, and the average attendance
for tin week was about twenty. James
11. Carmody, Horticultural Field Agent
for the Michigan Agricultural College
was aecnired to assist with this project,
and during his stay here demonstrated
his ability in orchard affairs. Some
attention was given to the trimming of
grapes, plums and pears, but most of
the time was devoted to apple and
peach orchards. Owing to the deep
snow in many sections of the county
it was necessary to do a considerable
amount of traveling on the railroad,
and it is to be regretted that some of
the meetings had to be cut short in
order not to disappoint those at the
next place.
During the four days, demonstrations
were held iu seven different townships
as follows: Alvin Balden, Mussey; Chas
Stevenson, Kimball; E. J. Young, Fort
Gratiot; George Beuge, St. Clair; Allen
and Eugene Atkins, Clyde; H. S. Hy
dorn, Brockway; Alex Young, Grant.
Tuesday afternoon was spent with
the Capac Grange at their hall north
and east of Capac where an account
of the work of the St. Clair County
Farmers' Federation together with
plans for 191( were discussed. Assist
ance was also given with the question
box, oat smut treatment, tuberculin
testing, and farmers' organizations be
ing among the subjects discussed. The
getting in touch with additional organ
izations is always considered an im
portant event in the affairs of the Far
mers' Federation, and it is gratifying
to note that nearly all of the live local
organirations are now cooperating in
the work.

The Expression of Many a Kidney

When the attacks were at their height,
my suffering was intense, A constant
burning sensation through my kidneys
bothered me and occasionally I had at
