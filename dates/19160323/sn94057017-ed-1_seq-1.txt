The State Record at Santa Fe
last week got out a special
"boom" edition of stxty-four
pages, containing good write-ups
of several of the counties in the
state, and considerable matter
devoted to some of the public in
stitutions of the state.
There is also a sketch of the
state, and short sketches of the
different counties by State Com
missioner of Lands, Robert P.
Ervien.
Mr. Ervien's remarks concern
ing Torrance county are as fol
lows: "Population in 1910, 10, 119; county
seat, Eatancia; acreage open to entry
under the U. S. Land Office at RoBwell,
surveyed, 147,422; unBurveyed, none.
Under the U. S. Land Office at Santa
Fe, surveyed, 450,058; unsurveyed,
117,840.
"Principal towns; Estancia, popula
tion, 517; altitude 6,177; Willard, popu
lation, 450; Mountainair, population,
350; Moriarty, population, 250.
"Torrance County is situated in the
central part of the state of New Mex
ico, and has long been recognized as
one of the principal grazing sections
of the state. In certain portions of
the county alkali has hindered its pro
gress, and lack of water has been an
other drawback, though the fact that
it is such a fine erazine country indi
cates that the soil is fertile and with
water for irrigation it might be de
veloped into a more productive locality.
"Owing to the large amount of acre
age open to entry in this county the
Btate engineer has been authorized to
sink three wells with a view of ascer
taining the depth necessary to go in
order to reach a flow of water sufFcient
for irrigation and domestic purposes,
but as yet only preliminary work on
this project has been accomplished.
"Forage crops have been raised with
some degree of success without irriga
tion, but as a rule dry farming is not
successful in this county. Salt is the
prevailing mineral found in this sec
tion of the state. Coal has also been
found in limited quantities, but has not
been mined extensively.
"The Manzano National Forest takes
in the western end of the county, and
the Lincoln National Forest a portion
of the southern end. The New Mexico
Central railroad runs through Torrance
County from north to south, touching
Estancia. Willard is a ju nction point
of this road and the Helen Cut-off of
the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe, and
Torrance is a junction point for the
New Mexico Central and the El Paso
& Southwestern roads.
"A grist mill is in operation at Mc
intosh in this county, using local grain
for its output.
"The normal annual precipitation in
Torrance county is 13 5 inches; normal
seasonal precipitation, from April to
September, 9.1 inches; normal seasonal
snuwlall, 30 1 inches; mean annual
temperature, 50 degrees; mean winter
temperature, 31 tiegrees, and m ean
summer temperature, 68 degrees, ac
cording to statistics Vrepured by the
U. S. Weather Bureau at Santa Fe,
from figures furnished by the station
at Estancia. "
It is hard to understand why
such a statement as the forego
ing should be published at all,
and still harder to understand
why it should appear in what is
denominated as a "boom" edi
tion. It really sounds like a
warning, issued in the fear that
some unwary stranger may wan
der into the county before those
state wells are finished and die
of thirst before he can get out.
That it will damage the coun
ty many thousands of dollars by
retarding its development goes
without say ing. Also, it is easily
understood that, appearing as it
does with the sanction of the
land commissioner, who will
naturally be supposed by strang
ers to be acquainted with condi
tions all over the state, it will be
very hard to meet and overcome
the impression produced. In
fact it will bo impossible to en
tirely overcome it.
Of course it makes no differ
ence so far as those who are ac
quainted with conditions here
are concerned, but it is in the
impression which it will produce
upon every stranger who reads
it that it becomes an incalculably
damaging slander on the county,
the measure of damage depend
ing upon the extent of its circu
lation. The people of the county who
have read the statément are
naturally much wrought up about
it. They have once before suf
fered from a knock similar to
this and likewise coming from an
official source, and they are get
ting tired of it.
We will not go into the matter
further at this time, because the
citizens of the county are prepar
ing to take concerted action and
do their best toward neutralizing
this latest knock on the county.

has been tried in that vicinity,
and so far has been successful.
A number of pieces sowed last
fall are looking fine now.
County Agent Harwell, during
his visit to the dry farm experi
ment station at Tucumcari was
much impressed with cowpeas as
a prospective profitable crop for
this county. This crop has test
ed out in a highly successful
manner as a dry farm crop at
Tucumcari. Mr. Harwell will
have more to say on the subject
shortly. Receiver Ely of the N.

$100 worth of seeds for the coun
ty this year, and Mr. Harwell
will try to. get him to furnish
cowpeas.
Just as we expected: T. F.
Mullen and wife returned from
Kansas last week. They went
there intending to stay, but
couldn't get things shaped up
just to suit, and it didn't look as
good to them as they thought it
would, and so they began to long
for the wild and wooly west.
Accordingly they loaded horses
and cattle and household goods
and came back, unloading at
Willard last week. Mr. Mullen
was so sure he was going to stay
when he was preparing to leave
last fall that he rented his place,
and now he can't get possession
of it until next year. However,
he will live on his son's place ad
joining this season ana larm
about twenty acres there that
has been broke.

GET RID OF THE PRAIRIE DOG
The Prairie Dog annually does great damage to our range and
to our cultivated crops. Losses from this source run into the
thousands of dollars. On the range control is more difficult be
cause of the large number of non
sequently small chance for co-operative action. Their damage to
cultivated crops is more easily controlled. The methods of con
trol should claim the attention of
County.
Either of the following methods
is recommended as being less expensive. Now is the time. Let's
get busy.
1 Fumigation. This method
ly, but may prove expensive in some cases. Carbon bisulphide is
used as the fu migan t It is a volatile liquid that may be procured
in one pound cans or in larger quantities, the price depending on
the quantity and quality and varying probably from 15 cents or
less to 50 cents a pound. The commercial variety is cheaper and
serves as well as the pure. The liquid is highly inflammable and
the gas from it is explosive, so keep all kinds of fire away. Keep
can tightly corked when not in use.
To use, saturate a piece of cotton, or like substance, as big as a
goose egg with the liquid, drop it as far down the hole as possible
and AT ÓNCE close the opening of the hole. All the holes lead-
ins into a burrow should be closed
if you can tell how the burrows
as quickly as possible the holes
necessary to keep the gas undiluted and confined, even though it
is heavier than air and naturally
row. More or less liquid than the above may be needed for larg
er or smaller holes. Sometimes the gas is exploded in the hole
with success. Observe caution in exploding it so as not to breathe
the fumes or be burned. Rainy, damp weather favors the use of
this method of killing the animals.
2 Poisoning. Poisoning is best done in winter or spring be"
fore the vegetation gets very green. Poisoned grain is the best
medium forgetting the poison into the system and poison -coated
grain has been found to work better than poison soaked grain.
Wheat, barley or kafir-corn may be used.
(a) Strychnine-starch coating: Grain (clean), 20 quarts;
strychnia sulphate (powdered), 1 ounce; sugar, 1 or 2 pints; gloss
starch (ordinary laundry starch); one-half teacupful; water (boil
ing), one and one-half pints.
Mix the starch in a little cold water, then add the boilingwater,
making a rather thick solution. While hot, stir in the strychnine
and mix until free from lumps. Add a few spoonfuls of water to
the sugar, then add this to the mixture and beat thoroughly.
Next, pour this poisoned mass over the grain and stir rapidly un
til the poison is evenly smeared over the grain-, then allow the
grain to dry. If well dried it will keep indefinitely.
Put out in early morning in two of three heaps of a teaspoonf ul
about each occupied burrow. Do not put out in rainy weather.
Take care that other animals do not get the poison.

Are You Interested?
Since the year 1900 Geo. P.
Learnard has been established in
the piano' business in ' Albuquer
que, and since that date has sold
more pianos to the people of
New Mexico than any other per
son in the state.
January 1, 1914, Mr. Learnard
conceived the idea that pianos
could be sold on a more satisfac
tory basis to both the purchaser
and himself by eliminating the
big items of store rent, partner
ship affairs, clerk hire and other
incidental expenses. Since that
date every piano purchaser, has
shared in the saving of expenses.
All pianos are shipped direct from
the factory to purchaser, and Mr.
Learnard, accompanied by Mr.
Leon R. Allen, Piano Tuner, now
travels overland continually and
calls personally on anyone who
desires information about pianos
and players, and especially those
who may be desirous of learning
about his new and successful
selling plans.
When you become interested in
purchasing a piano write to Mr.
Geo. P. Learnard personally and
you will receive a prompt reply
and the satisfaction that you
desire when you place your
hard earned dollars in the pur
chase of a piano for your home
