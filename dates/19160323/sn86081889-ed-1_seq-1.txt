Merrill W. Nace,
Cashier,
Feodalist Chieftain Dead.
Richard Roman, aged 75, head
of the famous Roman clan, of
mountain feudalists, was found
dead in bed at his home in Long
Hollow, about five miles west of
Hancock, early Wednesday morn
ing of last week by William Pry
or, a guest at the Roman home.
Roman and Pryor had been to
Hancock the day previous, and
Roman retired at night apparent
ly in good health.
Roman had a remarkable rec
ord. For years he and his sons,
cousins and nephews were en
gaged in a feud with the McCus
ker clan.
About six years ago Roman's
son, Jett Roman was killed near
Hancock by Claude McCusker
in a quarrel. The father for
weeks assisted the officers in
scouring the mountains for the
escaped murderer. One day Ro
man got a glimpse of the fugi
tive. He fired one shot and he
wounded him, but he escaped.
About two years ago McCus
ker was captured near Greens
burg, Pa., brought to Hagers
town, tried and sentenced to
eighteen years in the penitenti
ary. Richard Roman was a con
spicious witness at the trial.
Several months ago the old
feud between the Romans and
the McCuskers broke out afresh
and the veteran leader of the Ro
man clan was seriously beaten up
by a member of the McCusker
family. '
Roman is survived by his wid
ow and eleven children. He was
buried at Mount Olivet Church,
the Rev. James S. Webster, of
the Presbyterian church, Han
cock, officiating.
Colorado Ranchmen.
On Wednesday of last week,
Russell Myers, son of W. D. and
Aleba Hays Myers of Hancock,
left for Buffalo Creek, Colorado
to become associated with his
brother Horace on a large ranch.
Albert Hayes, son of our towns
man George W. Hays was a
pioneer ranchman in that sec
tion of Colorado several years
ago, and has made good. Albert
was joined last summer by his
brother Wilmer. The Myers
boys and the Hays boys are cous
ins and their ranches are within
easy reach of each other, which
will make it seem more home
like all around. The boys have
the best wishes of their eastern
friends. The Hancock News says:
"In Russell's departure Hancock
loses an estimable young man
and the only luck we wish him is,
that it may be his good fortune
to fall in love with some pretty,
wealthy western damsel, win her
heart, and return with his bride
tohis native heath." That is
just the kind of luck that Albert
Hays had; but both he and Mrs.
Hayes are too much in love with
life on the prairies to think of
returning to the hills of Penn
sylvania. Commendable.
On" Wednesday evening of last
week Mr. John R. Kline, son of
Milton Kline of Licking Creek
township this county, and Miss
Elizabeth Oakmau of the same
township were united in marriage
by Rev. J. L. Grove at the home
of the officiating clergyman in
McConnellsburg, Pa. Mr. Kline
has been away from home for
some fourteen years, latterly in
West Virginia, engaged in the
lumber business. He has forged
his way into position financially
to justify him in organizing a
home of his own. Hence he has
recently purchased a good farm
in Licking Creek township on the
Lincoln Highway, known as the
old Daniels farm. .And this
young couple are launching out
with buoyant hopes and promis
ing prospects in an occupation
honorable in itself ennobling in
its influence and beneficent to
the world.
They have the best wishes of
their many friends.

Groundhog a Fake.
Quoting the dates and the
weather thereof as proof the
Waynesboro Herald says:
The truth must be told about
this groundhog personage. He
is neither a prophet nor a son of
a prophet If he ever had any
such claims he has forfeited them
He stands eternlily discredited
in the prophet class. Raus mit
him!
He did not see his shadow Feb.
2, when he came out of the hole,
It was raining, hailing and snow
ing and the sun did not shine the
livelong day. According to the
groundhog traditions he should
have remained out and the wealh
er should have been fine for the
next six weeks, but just the re
verse happened. Instead of hav
ing spring, winter only began in
earnest, and there has been noth
ing else since. All the big snows
and the coldest weather and the
hardest freezes of the winter
came in the groundhog lap, and
all the ice harvested this winter
wa3 made in groundhog limit
North Carolina Booze.
Two moonshiners in North Car
olina recently got into a quarrel,
says an exchange, with the result
that one of them went into court
and exposed the business secrets
of the other. Here is the recipe
for the latest North Carolina tip
ple, called .white lightning:
"One bushel corn meal, 100
pounds of sugar, two boxes
of lye, four plugs of tobacco,
four pounds of pokeroot ber
ries, two pounds of soda.
Water to measure and dis
till." "This recipe is for fourteen and
one-half gallons of the 'third rail
lickah, suh,' two drinks of which,
the North Carolina informant
said, 'would make a rabbit spit
in a bull dog's eye.' "
Burned to Death.
Agnes Thomas (colored) aged
11 years and 9 months, daughter
of Anthony Thoma3 deceased,
lived in the home of Mannie Lane
(colored) at the foot of themoun
tain east of Webster Mills. Last
week Mrs. Lane was sick in bed,
and Agnes was doing some work
about the cook stove, when her
clothing became ignited. Mrs,
Lane heard the girl scream but
was powerless to help, and Agnes
instead of trying to get hold of
something in which to wrap her
self and thus smother the flames
ran out of doors. She was so
terribly burned that death, re
sulted. She died last Friday and
was buried in Union cemetery
Sunday.

One Breed of Cattle In a Community.
One breed of cattle in a com
munity is strongly urged by L.
W. Lighty, expert on dairying
and animal husbandry of the De
partment of Agriculture, who
says:
"In several communities in
Pennsylvania the farmers have
mutually agreed to practically all
keep the same breed of cattle.
We sometimes refer to this plan
a3 community breeding and it is
an excellent plan for a certain
limited territory to have cattle
practically all of the same breed.
This plan is feasible in many sec
tions and its advantages are all
worth looking into. One decided
and profitable advantage is the
fact that such a community at
tracts large buyers from a dis
tance who know what they want
and pay top prices. Such com
munities are not at the mercy of
a local buyer who fixes prices to
suit himself, but competing buy
ers come in and offer the best
prices of the country. Commu
nity breeding enables us to sel
our surplus at top prices.
"Another great advantage is
the ease by which we can im
prove our stock. In a communi
ty where everybody is interested
in one certain breed it is profit
able to bring in the best sires
that money can buy and the most
promising cow3 may be bred to
such a sire and thus we are sure
of constant improvement and
building up of our stock. An
isolated breeder cannot afford, as
a business proposition, to pur
chase the best and most promis
ing sire. The breed selected be
comes the pride of the communi
ty and everybody vies with ev
erybody else to possess the best
Before very long not only has
the stock been wonderfully im
proved, but the people by friend
ly competition have educated
themselves in practical stock
breeding and caring for the same
so as to do and show their best.
They want to make a favorable
impression on the stranger com
ing into the community and they
get profitable prices for their
stock and thus have the cash to
improve their farms, buildings,
roads, schools and altogether ele
vate and enrich the community.
"This is a rural uplift that up-
lifts, instead of wild talk and
palaver that is so overmuch in
dulged in. Let those communi
ties that have not thus benefited
investigate the merits of this
practice to their own general ad
vantage. Community breeding
of cattle, horses, swine, poultry
and other stock, has many ad
vantages and no disadvantages."
Must Show Necessity.
The new Judge, Mr. Bailey, in
the Bedford-Huntingdon-Mifflin
District in his refusal to grant to
the Leister House Huntingdon a
license to sell intoxicating liquors
has this to say:
"From the testimony adduced
by the petitioners there appears
as the particular and controlling
reason for the necessity of the
license that with the bar, peti
tioners would be able to furnish
better boarding and more fit lodg
ing for the guests, It is expect
ed that the patronage of the bar
will assist in paying the expen
ses incident to the operation of
the other departments of the ho
tel. The theory of the applicants
is that they cannot, in the . ab
sence of the bar, furnish ade
quate hotel accomodations at the
price fixed by them as proper
without loss, and the conclusion
follows that they expect to give
to the boarders in the hotel by
reason of the bar, by way of
boarding and lodging, actually
more than they pay for.
"This court does not believe
that the act of May 13, 1887, un
der which this application is
made, contemplates that a gift of
any part of the hotel accomoda
tion by the landlord is the touch
stone upon which the necessity
of a license is to be tested."

SPRING TONICS.
Little Talks on Health and Hygiene by
Samuel G. Dixon; M. D., LU D.,
Commissioner of Health.
With the honk of the wild
geese flying northward the pa
tent medicine and home remedy
manufacturers seem inspired a
new and there follows a wave of
spring tonic advertisements.
The tonic which the vast ma
jority of individuals need at this
period of the year is fresh air,
exercise and a simpler diet. Ow
ing to weather conditions many
of our activities are restricted in
the winter time. There is also a
tendency to eat excessively of
meat and fatty foods. As a re
sult when the spring arrives with
its warm days many of us are
like a furnace that has been so
choked with fuel that it doesn't
draw well.
You cannot buy relief from
these conditions at a dollar a bot
tle. Medicine will not make up
for over eating and under exer
cise. The high death rate which
almost invariably prevails at this
season of the year from pneumo
nia, tuberculosis and other res
piratory diseases is largely due
to the reduced physical resis
tance of individuals, which makes
them particularly sensitive when
the sudden changes of tempera
ture occur which are common at
this time of the year. Old peo
ple are susceptible as they are
housed more closely during the
winter time than young folks.
Let your spring tonic prescrip
tion read something as follows.
1 Eat meat but once a day
and sparingly.
2 Those not under the doctor's
care should take a glass of wa
ter before retiring for the night
and one an hour before break
fast 3 Get all the fresh air possi
ble. 4 Sleep with your windows
open.
5 See that your clothing is
heavy enough to protect you
against sudden changes of weath
er. 6 Walk in the open air five or
six miles a day.
Nervous Hens Spoil Hatches.
Breeds of chickens are divided
into sitters and non-sitters. Non
sitters include all the light, ner
vous breeds known as eirir-tvDe
breeds, of which Leghorns are
representative. These breeds
are too easily frightened, are not
reliable enough and are too close
feathered for setting. Larire
breeds like Brahma and Cochin
although they make good moth-,
ers, are often too heavy and
clumsy and they break the eggs.
The best sitters, accordine to
authorities at the Pennsylvania
State College School of Agricul
ture and Experiment Station, are
those found on the farm such as
Wyandottes, Plymouth Rocks,
Rhode Island Reds and Orping
tons. The first step in setting a hen
is to remove her to the brooding
house at night, where she should
be placed upon several infertile
or glass eggs to discover her in
tentions. The closed type of
nest from fourteen to sixteen
inches square, from which the
hen may be. released for a period
each day is preferable. A sod
two or three inches thick placed
grass-side down in the nest will
supply moisture durine the hatch
The sod should bo covered with
a base 6i fine straw under a lay
er of coarser straw.
To insure freedom from lice a
hen should be dusted with a eood
powder before she is set and at
intervals of 5 to 7 day3 thereaf
ter. An'oddilnumber pf eggs,
rom9tol5, accordine to the
size of the hen. will fit into the
nest better than an even number.
The Pennsylvania Station rec
ommends testing at the end of
the first week to remove the in
fertile eggs, as one rotten egg
mav snoil the whnlo apttinw Tha
Bitting hen should be fed once a
aay on a mixture or whole grain,
