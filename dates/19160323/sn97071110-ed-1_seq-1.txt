GROWERS HEAR
AGENCY PLAN
UNIFORM CONTRACT IS BIG STICK
C. W. Moomaw on Saturday Points Out
Chief Features of Government's
Suggestion for Marketing
With as much interest as though the?
had been attending a highly entertain
ing theatrical performance, a mass
meeting of Underwood. Wash.. Dufur
district and local apple growers lis
tened to pointed facts of an address de
livered at the Commercial club Satur
day afternoon by Clarence W.Moomaw,
representative of the Office of Markets
of the United States Department of
Agriculture, who in outlining the pro
posed plans of a central growers' agen
cy declared that by signing a uniform
contract the grower will hold a "big
stick" over the operations of sales
agencies. The uniform contract pro
vides, said Mr. Moomaw, for the with
drawal of tonnage, unless the agree
ments embodied in it are carried out.
'Throughout the east." said Mr.
Moomaw, "the fruit districts of the
northwest have been pointed out as
models in the line of cultivation of
orchards and marketing. But we have
discovered that you have used your or
ganisations of certain districts to right
the organizations of other districts, and
through your fighting have been dissi
pating your energies and resources.
You yourselves have realized that there
has been enough fighting, and unless
there is a let up, you are going under."
Mr. Moomaw explained that the cen
tral organization of growers and sales
agencies, to be conducted at Spokane,
would be known as the Growers Agen
cy, incorporated, to avoid existing
legal provisions, be stated, the organ
ization is a combination of actual grow
ers and selling interests, the board of
trustees being composed of five grow
ers and five sales interest representa
tives, these 10 choosing an eleventh.
According to the proposed plan any res
ident northwest agency that assembles
and sells a minimum of 100 carloads of
fruit may become a member of the
central organization on payment of an
annual fee of $100. If a grower,' pro
vided he raises a minimum of a carload
of fruit, thinks that he needs greater
representation than that granted by
signing the uniform contract, he may
secure a passive membership by 'pay
ment of an annual fee of $5. Any
f;rower, whose tonnage reaches a car
oad, may become an active member by
pavment of $100. Communities msy
select a representative from their midst
and join in the payment or the annual
fee for an active membership.
Mr. Moomaw declared that the apples
of the northwest had changed from a
former novelty basis when extteme
high prices were realized, to that of a
commodity basis, and tbat adjustments
must be made to meet commodity prices
now being realized.
In his judgment, as expressed in his
address, the greatest benefits to be de
rived from the combined efforts of
growers, through the proposed central
agency, will be realized by the gather
ing of market reports ana tne estab
lishing each season of a uniform value
of the product before the selling season
begins. The uniform contract calls for
cooperative machinery in securing reli
able crop reports on all fruits, and
agencies are required to hold frequent
conferences prior to the opening of
selling seasons, although they are pro
hibited by the Sherman anti-trust law
from setting a price.
During past seasons, according to
Mr. Moomaw, returns on apples have
been reduced 10 per cent because of
improper methods of handling the prod
uct in the orchards. The uniform con
tract calls for the establishment of
community packing houses, which will
enable growers to get their crops into
cold Btorsge plant in a minimum time
and yet utilize home and family labor.
Except for two digressions in hie
talk, Mr. Moomaw's address was of a
general nature, applying to any north
western fruit district. In one of the
instances he told local growers that
they should be wained of their prone-
ness to believe that in tne production
of Newtowns and Spitzenburgs they
were engaged in a specialized industry.
"It is true." said Mr. Moomaw,
"that other districts raise but few of
these varieties, but the fruit that they
do produce competes to such an extent
witn yours mac you win ue aiueu uy
any general movement toward coopera
tion." In the other instance Mr. Moomaw
braised the local growers for their fore
sight in providing adequate storage
facilities for a large portion of their
annual production.
"We have been so bold, he said, "as
to point out to other districts the inde
pendence you fruit men here nave be'
cause of your storage facilities."
Mr. Moomaw characterized the an
nual scramble of sales agencies for ton
nage as a very hurtful influence.
"Agencies should be engaged at mis
time in plans of marketing, and the
minimum uniform contract provides
that the time for signing tonnage con
tracts must be limited. We propose to
limit this period on apples to July 1
The representative of markets pointed
out that the uniform contract calls for
the cooperation of sales agencies in
chartering ships for the exportation of
fruits to foreign countries.
"we had in mind," he said, "When
we inserted wis Clause, ice opening
of a fruit trade route to Europe tbrougi
the Panama canal, and unless you fruit
growers take some action on this mat
ter, we do not believe sucn a route wi
ever be opened."
Mr. Moomaw also cited complaints
against freight rates.
"It is true," be said, "tbat whiu
prices on northwesters boxed apples
have slowly declined for the past sev
eral years, the freight rates have rc
mained the same, but you will never Lo
able to secure a good result in getting
readjustments as individuals as you
will bv organization. "
It was expected thst Dr. Hector Me
Pherson, of the Oregon Agricultural
College, who will cooperate with the
government in outlining to growers the
plans of the new agency, would be here,
but it was impossible for him to come.
Mr. Moomaw in his discussion of the
need of northwestern growers to cease
their homicidal competition told a good
story.
"Your fighting," he said, makes rr.e
think of an Irishman and a negro down
home. They were everlastingly fight
ing. Their frequent scraps soon grew
into a neighborhood disgrace, and one
day after they had met and mixed on
the roadside, a number of the repre
sentative citisens took them to a rear
barnyard and drawing a ring told tbem
to fight it out, and let tba fight be an
end of their troubles. 'When one of you
has enough,' instructed the ringleader
of the contest preparations, 'just yell
sufficiency, and we will consider that
you hae had enough and the other fel
low will be pulled off.'
'The two men fought till each was
black eyed and bloody. After both were
pretty well worn out the Irishman tin
ally cried, 'sufficiency.' 'Thank God,
white man,' cried the darkey, 'I been
tryin' fer the last half hour to think of
that word.' "
Mr. Moomaw stated that the central
Spokane office would be operated by
the growers and agenciea themselves,
tbat the government would act only in
an advisory capacity.
He stated that the new plan bad been
worked out in such manner that better
things could be evolved, and that in the
future it waa hoped that the plans
would permit of growers enjoying all
privileges of the. Clayton amendment
of the Sherman anti-trust law.
It is expected that the Growers'
Asencv will be formally oroanized at
Spokane today, when the government
men will meet with representatives of
selling agencies. P. S. Davidson, pres
ident ol the Apple Growers Associa
tion, will represent Wilmer Siear at the
meeting.
Atfer the formal organization, a cam
paign for the signing of uniform con
tracts will be begun.

land will be represented at the Com
mercial club minstrel show to go on the
Doards next Monday night at the Heil-

men, but they will bandy around in
song and jokes the names of numerous
local men.and local color gridiron jokes

nine, C. N. Clarke, Allen Button, Mer

Winston Accepts Government Job
J. R. Winston, who has been spend
ng the winter at the University of
Wisconsin engaged in advanced patho
logical studies, has tendered to the
Oregon experiment station his resigna

station. Mr. Winston writes that he

gaged? in experiments wth citrus fruit
diseases.
LeRoy Childs has been appointed

Mr. Winston writes that he dislikes
to leave Hood River, but that he took
the government position, which was
voluntarily offered, because of the un
certainty of a continuation of the local
work.
Friends Urge Nickelsen to Run
Friends ot J. R. Nickelsen are urging
that he make the race for county com
missioner in opposition to J. O. Han
num, present incumbent. Petitions for

publican ticket are being circulated.
Mr. Nickelsen. who now resides on
bis Alderbrook poultry ranch west of

having owned tbe mercantile business
now conducted by Gilbert & DeWitt.
He is still owner of the big Cascade
avenue building. While a resident of
Hood River he figured prominently in
public affairs. For 14 successive years
ue was city recoruer.anu wu justice oi
the peace ror lour years.
A strong pressure is being made also
to have Mr. Nickelsen make the race
for state senator for Hood River and
Wasco counties, and he will likely cast
bis hat in the ring for one or the other
of the offices.
Hood River Defeats The Dalles
One of the most enthusiastic crowds
ever assembled at a local athletic
meet, formed ringside spectators Mon

IMPROVEMENTS
ARERUSHED
WORK WILL BE FINISHED APRIL 15
East Fork Irrigation District Will Be One
of the Most Complete and Thorough
Systems in the State
Crews of men of the Palmer Ellison
Co. are now rushing to completion
work on the last of a series ef con
tracts let by the board of directors of
the bast fork Irrigation District, or
ganized three years ago, and by April
15 the system will be the most com
plete and thorough one in Oregon oper
ating under the statutes providing for
tbe district administration. Of the
13,000 acres comprised in the district,
approximately 11,000, divided into 10
acre plots, water supplied to each, will
be covered by the network of flumes
and pipe lines.
The district will distribute 5.000 inch
es of water the coming season. It has
a capacity of 6,000 inches. The water
is secured from the East Fork of Hood
river, and a small amount from Neal
creek.
Many of the distributing lines have
been placed in pipes under pressure,
making the sprinkler system ef irriga
tion available.
The main canal and main laterals of
the big system hsve a total length of 21
miles, and the length of the network of
sub-laterals and distributing flumes and
pipe lines will resch more than 400
miles. Since the district was organized
in 1913 it has been the policy of the
board of directors to do permanent im
provement work. Wooden flumes have
been replaced with steel flume and pipe
line. Concrete headworks and gates
have been constructed. More than
$100,000 have been expended in im
provements in the three years.
lhe building, improvement and ex
tension of the irrigation system, for
merly controlled by a ioint stock com
pany of ranchers Known as the East
Fork Irrigating Co., has been financed
by sale of $210,000 worth of bonds. Be
cause of the general disrepute of bonds
of irrigation projects it was found im
possible to dispose of the first issue
through the usual channels of bond
brokers. The issues were for the most
part purchased by local investors. And
feature of the successive issues was
that the last sale brought several cents
more than the first issues.
At the present time Hood River
county has the two most successful irri
gation districts in the state, the Hood
Kiver Irrigation District covering 6,000
acres in the West Side orchard district.
The latter system is bonded for $160,
000. It has been in operation for alniOBt
10 years.
