Outrom of Election it Impor
tant and Great Interest U
Being Manifested Therein.
On next Thursday, March 30, the
qualified voters of the f irst super
visor's district are to decide at the
l-olls whether or not they will issue
In mis in the nam of $40 000 to im
piove their highways, and a pub'ic
meeting is to be hjll at CaVdoniu
at 2 o'clock tomorrow, Friday, uf.
ttrnoon for the purpjse of mousing
interest on the part of citi:cns. j?
the district and ure.nvf thein to vote
for the proposed bond issue.
The impending election is of far
more than local importance, as the
only portion of the Mississippi route
for the proposed Jackson Memorial
Highway lying within the borders of
Lowndes county which is not com
plete is a short stretch of roadway
ia the First district, and if the bonds
are voted this road will at once be
improved, and the route of the high
way which is to perpetuate the mem
ory of "Old Hickory" will, so far as
Lowndes county is concerned, be
complete.
I There is some diversity of opinion
in the First district regarding road
improvement, and it is said i that
quite a number of the best men in
the section oppose the proposed bond
feie. This opposition is due to econ
omic views which they hold on the
subject, it being, in their opinion,
nwia to make any expenditure of
public money' that is not absolutely
" ecesrsy." loose who nnve sWurfcii
the problem, however, are fully con
vinced that the proposed expenditure
would be wise and judicious as the
improvement of public highways al
ways enhances the value of laias ad
jacent thereto, and the increase in
land values in this instance will more
than offset the increase in taxes re
sulting 'from the bond issue.
Several orators of well known for
ensic ability will deliver addresses,
and it is expected that a large crowd
will attend the meeting.

a mile and a half north of Ksnes.
The French, however, are vigor
ously contesting a further advance
eastward, which not alone would
bring the German line nearer the
fortress, but spreading fan-like
northeastward, would put in jeopar

Germans were unable to launch an

"To Have and to Hold" is classed
as a masterpiece of American fic

no expense in producing it. The
story has been widely read even in
Europe as well as this country, and
is based on the famous Sir Edwin

arson charge, but plead guilty to the
accusation of having beaten the

A lihort time after the house
burned Johnson, who, it is said was
once quite intimate with the woman,
is alleged to have given the police
information which resulted in her
arrest and conviction on the charge
of retailing, and subsequent to the
trial she swore out an affidavit
charging him with having ignited the
blaze which destroyed her home.
Johnson lives in Alabama, and
left Columbus soon after the trial.
He returned to the city last week,
however, and was promptly arrested
by Constables Foreman and Robert

the testimony sufficiently convinc

he was therefor acquitted on that
charge. The defendant was repre

APPOINTMENT AND GIVES
SENATOR COMMISSION.
Indianapolis, Ind., March 22.
Thomas Taggart, Democratic nation
al committeeman, was appointed
United States senator to fill the va
cancy caused by the death of Sena
tor Shivley by Gov. Ralston Thurs
day. The new senator has been promin
ent in politics in Indiana for 25
years, and has maintained the leader
ship of the Democratic party prac
tically all of the time. The only of
fices Mr. Taggart has ever held were
auditor of this (Marion) county for
two terms, and three times mayor of
Indianapolis.
Governor Ralston wrote Mr. Tag
gart a letter saying it afforded him
genuine pleasure to appoint him
United States senator.
"Vou have long and faithfully
s-erved your party," said Governor
Ralston, "at great personal sacrifice
to yourself, both in labor and in
money. It the Democratic party has
been sound in its platform de:lara
tions during the past 25 years, then
you have been sound in your advo
cacy of political policy for without
i hon of personal preferment, or re
! ward, you have championed the cause
.of your party with dauntless cour
tage and an inspiring optimism."

POPULAR REPRESENTATIVE OF
FIRST WARD WILL STAND
FOR RE-ELECTION.
It is with unfeigned pleasure that
tie Commercial presents " to its
readers this morning the official an
nouncement of Hon. B. A. Weaver
as a candidate, for rejt'lon as
councilman from the first ward.
Mr. Weaver is the dean of the
council, having for more than a
quarter of a century been a mem
ber of that body, and his work
Ftands out so conspicuously that any
comment thereon really seems super
fluous. During the term of his in
cumbency Columbus has grown
from n small town to a city of no
mean proportions, and he has been
an active participant in every move
ment looking toward her advance
ment. During the quarter of a cen
tury that he has been on the board
there have been many municipal im
provements. Two new school build
ings have been erected and provision
for a third one made, electric lights
have succeeded gas as an illum
inating agency on the streets of
the city, new water works and sew
erage systems have been installed,
a municipal creamatory has been '
erected and the streets in the bus-'
ines district have been paved with '
asphalt. These are only some of the
big things that have been t accom-'
plished since Mr. Weaver has been
a member of the council. Many other
minor improvements have been
made, and in making provision for
them he always took a progressive
stand, never failing to advocate any
judicious expenditure of money, but
always demanding that each expen
diture should be judicious and that
the people should receive full value
for the money disbursed.
As a financier Mr. Weaver will
measure shoulder to shoulder not
only with any citizen of Columbus
but with any man in Mississippi, lie
not only conducts a large drug
store but is president of the Colum
bus National I!ank, and his finan
cial ability and experience have
been exceedingly valuable to the
city in the purchase of supplies and
in the making of contracts of var
ious character.
Mr. Weaver combines the happy
faculty of being an astute financier
and a tenial, urbane and exceeding
ly clever gentleman, one who is loyal
both to his friends and his duty. It
is a generally conceded fact that he
is one of the most popular men in
Columbus, and those who are best
acquainted with him do not wonder
at this for some inspired writer has
said that "Kind hearts are more
than coronets," and everyone who
enjoys Mr. Weaver's friendship
realize that few men possess more
kindly hearts or more sympathetic
natures than he, as on many oc
casions he has given practical proof
of these exceedingly noble but at
the Fame time exceedingly rare
characteristics.
So far Mr. Weaver has no oppon
ent for the offices to which he as
pires, and his simple announcement
probably means that he will be re
elected without opposition.

The people of the Columbus school
district have recently made provision
for the erection and equipment of
a modern high school building by vot
ing bonds in the sum of $50,000 for
that purpose, and a committee com
posed of Messrs. D. S. McClanahan
and L. W. Stevens fro the city
Council, and Prof. W. V. Frierson,
superintendent of public schools re
cently visited Jackson, Yirksburg
and other cities for the purpose of
inspecting their high schools and

ENTERS CAMPAIGN AS CANDI
DATE AGAINST MR. McCLAN
AHAN IN WARD 4.
Mr. J. T. Clardy has decided to
enter the councilmanic race, and is
this morning officially announced
as a candidate for councilman from
the fourth ward, which for many
years past has been represented by
Mr. D. S. McClanahan.
Although Mr. Clardy has been a
resident of Columbus for many
years this in the first time he has
offered for public office, and ' hi.-;
entrance into the political arena re
sults from the earnest solicitations
of many friends, who for some time
past have been persistently urging
him to allow his name to go before
the people as a candidate for coun
cilman. Mr. Clardy is engaged in the
grocery business, being the proprie
tor of a large suburban store in the
northwestern portion of the city.
H is largely a self-made man, hav
ing started out on small capital and
built up his present prosperous bus
iness, and his frienda confidently
assert that, if elected, he will, as
councilman from the fourth ward.dis
play the same sugacity that has en
abled him to achieve success in pri
vat lite.

The citizen of Berlin, a small
town in Kansas, wants to change the
name of their town. The citizens
say there is not a person in their
town or close to it, who is in sym

the name of the town is the cause of
many jibes at the inhabitants by
traveling salesmen who "make" the
town.
The United States is the only
country where one can say offensive
things about the chief executive and
go unpunished, which may have
something to do with the traditional
