RAPID ACTION
ALONG BORDER
TO BfPOSSIBlE
Report of Herrera Revolt is
Regarded as True—U. S.
Troops Prepared.
REBEL MIGHT CUT
IMPORTANT ROAD
It is Doubted if Carranza's
Troops are in Position
to Oppose Herrera.
San Antonio, Tex., March 23.—Or
ders going from Fort Sam Houston
today provided for rapid action at
various points along the border should
new rebellions In Mexico make it
necessary.
General Funston is not altogether
convinced.of the truth of the report
that Luis Herrera," the deposed mili
tary leader at Chihuahua, had entered
the field with Villa against the United
States, but the repetition of the story
in different places, and the absence
of acceptable evidence to the contrary
caused him and his staff to regard it
aa probably true.
To Guard Border.
Staff officers of General Funston
studied the more extended area of
northern Mexico. Probable moves of
Herrera and his 2,000 men were care
fully considered, and at every point
along the border where they might
disturb those on the American side,
careful note was taken of the position*
of American troops and the time it
would take to get them to the scene.
That phase of the situation did not
alarm army officers, however, who be
lieved that if Herrera really has .re
volted, his activities will be confined
to ^Iterations that have for their ob
ject the strengthening of Villa's bands
and the harrasslng of General Pir
shlng'a forces.
May, Cat. Road.'
It was feared that one of Herrera's
first moves—against which Funston is
powerless—would be the cutting of
the Northwestern railroad over which
Funston hopes to ship supplies to the
American troops, now almost 200
miles into Mexico.
More Revolts Feared.
It also is doubted if Carranza's
troops are in a position to oppose
Herrera. Reports at headquarters
that General Gavria's garrison at
Juarez is about to revolt and that the
troops at Torreon are manifesting dis
affection, are regarded with appre
hension at the front.
The Mexican consul here today con
tinued to deny their truth and reiter
ated his assertion that Herrera has
not taken the field.
SPEAKER TOJOIN
BOSTON RED SOX
Boston, March 23.—Tris Speaker,
crack centerflelder of the world
champion Red Sox, who had refused
to join the team because of objections
to a salary reduction, wrote President
Lannln that he would go to the train
ing camp at Hot Springs, Ark., at
once. Speaker will go through the
practice season and take up the sal
ary question when the Red Sox re
turn to Boston.
The contract tendered Speaker call
ed for $9,000, the amount of his salary
in 1913. The following year Federal
league activities resulted in his ob
taining a contract at $35,000 for two
seasons.
NORTON GIVES

Interesting Address Before
Sock and Buskin
Society.
A program unusually Instructive
and attractive was that given last
evening by the Sock and Buskin so
ciety at the university. The subject
was "Shakespeare in Mufelc," and the
address was presented by Professor
W. W. Norton, director of music for
the society, was full of information.
The discussion concerned Itself with
two phases of the subject: Shakes
peare in music, and the music in
Shakespeare's orks. Stereopticon
slides were used to illustrate the dif
ferent kinds of instruments used in
Shakespeare's time. These instru
ments were of great variety, and
many of the instruments of our day
have been evolved from them. Illus
trating these further, Victrola records
were used.
In speaking of the music in Shakes
peare's plays Professor Norton told
of the manner in which the soqgs
were sung, and also told how the
musical efTects off the stage were pro
duced. The songs used in Illustration
were: "Hark, Hark the Lark," "Take,
0 Take Those Lips Away," "Full Fa
thom Five," "Where the Bee Sucks,"
"Who is Sylvia," "Mistress Mine, "It
Was a1 Lover and His Lass," "Come
Away Death," and "Ophelia's Songs."
1 The music Inspired. by Shakes
peare's works forms a large contribu
tion to thp world of music. Arias
'from some of the operas presented
were "Romeo and Juliet," "Merry
Wives of Windsor," and "Midsummer
Night's Dream."
PrMessbr Norton 1s very inter
nee ting speaker His subject was a
"fascinating one, and the meeting was

The French are still clinging to part

Germans gained a footing last evening
in an attack along the front between
Avocaurt Wood and Malancourt,

The persistence with which the

to break through in the sector where
their lines have been pushed nearest

over the desert might be readily cut
should Villa recruit a formidable body
of men.

among the populace in the mountain
districts urging them to support him
against the Americans. He is report
ed to be equipping his men with arms

FLAMES CARRIED

Firemen Helpless, and Out

the Blaze.
Augusta, Ga., March 23.—One of
a series of fires which has caused mil
lions of dollars damage in the last
few days in the south and southwest,
swept through the business blocks of
Augusta, and 20 adjoining residence
blocks last night and early today, and
before being placed under control,
caused damage of more than $6,000,
000.
Business Wiped Out.
The flame-swept area covers one
and one-quarter square miles. In it
are the city's largest offices, business
buildings on the north side of Broad
street warehouses on the historic
"cotton row," containing thousands of
bales of cotton and some 600 homes,
many of them In the city's most ex
clusive residence section. Among other
structures destroyed was St. Paul's
Episcopal church, built 135 years ago.
Militia Helps.
The militia helped the firemen to
fight the flames, but the Augusta
firemen were powerless before the
conflagration, and fire apparatus was
sent from Columbus, Charleston, At
lanta, Macon, Savannah and Waynes
boro. The wind subsided this morn
ing, and It was not until then that
the firemen could gain in their fight.
Many of the homeless spent the
night walking the streets, while others
slept In the halls of large hotels.
Xo Cause Known.
Officials of the fire department are
unable to find an explanation for the
cause of the Are.
A twelve-story building owned by
the Augusta Chronicle was practically
destroyed. The Augusta Herald build
ing was also burned.
Cotton interests estimated that the
fire destroyed about $2,000,000 worth
of cotton stored in warehouses.

(Herald Special Service.)
Winnipeg, Man., March 23.—Mill
tary authorities have turned Into the
provincial department of agriculture
lists of men available for work on
farms when seeding operations com
mence. The result of the soldter's
registration plan has proved more or
less of a disappointment as out of the
thousands of men who could go, only
300' have signified their willingness.
This Is held remarkable In view of the
(act that men who go will get not only
pay from farmers, but their usual pay
from the army.
Some battalions failed to turn in the
name of one' man while others had but
two or three soldiers who desired to
"turn the sword into a plowshare" for
a brief season.
An official of the Grain Grower*' as

Coming in

Counties.
Robert LaFollette, and Gunder Ol
son continued to Increase their lead
for republican presidential nominee,
and national committeeman In the re
turns from all parts of the state re
ceived today.
In the democratic primary John
Bruegger and H. H. Perry continue
to run a neck and neck race for na
tional committeeman. The result of
this contest is still doubtful, and it
may not be determined until all of the
returns are in.
Incomplete returns indicate that
the delegates to the national conven
tion of the republican party will be
divided between the slate named by
the state central committee and the
independents.
Returns from the Missouri slope,
which are still incomplete, may cut
down LaFollette's lead to some extent,
but the present indications-are that he
will be the presidential nominee by
a majority which will exceed that of
Estabrook by three to one.
Gunder Olson is drawing away from
William I/omke, and the-present Indi
cations are that his majority will be
almost as large as that of LaFollette.
Returns are np.w octaping in. rapidly,
