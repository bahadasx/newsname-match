FRENCH POIIIItlS
TO BET WAR REGDRQ
(Associated Press)
PARIS, March 25 French o)itic
ians are already much Interested in
tbn question 'wlieth-r it will be neces
sary" for c'audidat'js for public office
after the re-establishment of peace to
have a war record. Some members of
the Chamber Ol Deputies who have
stuck to the Palais Bourbon instead
of joining the army have shown irri
tation at the publicity given to ex
ploits of their colleagues, some of
whom have been killed and others like
Monsieur Maginot, former assistant
secretary of war, have been repeatedly
cited in the orders of the day.
One deputy who recently returned
to Paris on leave of absence said he
had found that presence at the front
was far better than an elctoral cam
paign for his political Interests as well
as for the salvation of .the country.
"Besides," he said, "It is for the
cannon to do the speaking now;"
One Socialist deputy, Interrupting
an orator who was recalling the ex
ploits of one of their colleagues at lhe
front, declared: "It is not his place;
his place is here." This opinion now
seems to be shared by a considerable
majority of the Parliament but not al
together by the public. The munici
pal .council of the city of Neuilly; whose
mayor, Monsieur Nortier, who was also
a deputy and who enlisted at 60 years
of age, carried the colors of his regi
ment and was killed on the battlefield,
passed unanimously the following reso
lution: "The municipal council of the city
of Neuilly-sur- Seine whose mayor,
deputy for the department of the Seine,
fell upon the field of honor, consider
ing that the defense of-the country is
the first duty of a citizen, that equali
ty before the law is the formal right
of Frenchmen whoever they may be
and that no member of any elective
body should seek to avoid It, that the
representatives of the people should
be the first to give the example of re
spect for the law and the duties of
citizens, expresses the wish that all
senators and deputies of military fit
ness be obliged to do their military
duty as all other citizens."
Socialists, radicals, radical socialists
and other elements see in all such al
lusions an attack upon the parliament,
and considerable anxiety is betrayed
in certain parties as to whether this
spirit will grow and what effect it will
have no politics when hostilities have
ceased on the field of battle. There
have also appeared speculations as to
the a'ccounts that must inevitably be
rendered after the war by parties re
sponsible for obstructing or neglecting
the development of armaments in the
fact of Germany's obvious preparation.

(A-sso elated Rsesg)
NEW YORK, March 25. Thirteen
thousand will see the Willard-Moran
fight tonight. Every seat has been
sold. Both of the principals are con
fident. Moran claims that he will de
liver a knockout in the seventh or
eighth round. Willard said that if
Moran is as aggressive as has been
promised he would knock oil'. Moran.
No decision possible under boxing laws
but possible that Moran will win the
title on a foul or knockout, or on Wil
Iard's failure to go the full ten rounds.
COMMUNICATED
One of our fellow citizens proposes
a curfew ordinance for married men
and in these days of woman's rights,
woman's suffrage, etc., we wonder if
those of the male sex who are old
enough to be married men, are to be
subject to juvenile laws, such as a cur
few, why it would not be a good idea
to make a law whereby every married
man could have a nurse maid in con
stant attendance to guard him from all
harm all said nurse maids to be
young and pretty.

UP FROM PORTO RICO
(Associated Pressj
SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, Mar. 25
Sugar valued at $10,000,000 is being
marketed by Porto Rico this month.
Every ship to the United States is car
rying capacity loads. The month's de
liveries present probably not more
than 25 per cent of the value of the
sugar produced this season. Most of
the sugar is being sold on a rising
market at prices considerably above
$5 per hundred pounds.
Never before in the history of the
island have the sugar men had such
a large crop nor prospects of such uni
form high prices. The island's pro
duction, if is estimated, will be in the
neighborhood of 380,000 tons, an in
crease of approximately 75,000 tons
over last year. And under present
market conditions It is expected that
the whole crop will be sold at an aver-
ase of .'five cehts'per pounds or better.
Large sales this week were reported
at $5.22 San Juan, equal to $5.40 New
! York.
Labor troubles which developed at
the beginning of the cane harvest in
January have practically all subsided
and the grinding' season is now at its
height. At but one point in the island,
Arecibo, are there any labor troubles
at present and these are expected to
be settled at any moment.
In practically every instance the la
borers have received an increase in
wages and shorter hours of labor. For
the first time in the history of the
sugar industry the sugar planters have
granted the field labor an eight hour
day. One of the largest mills in the
island, the Fajardo Sugar company,
signed a contract with its laborers pro
viding for a minimum wage of 75
cents a day on a nine-hour basis. This
same company has also placed all of
its, employes in the sugar mill proper
on a wage based on the price of sugar.
Already they have received bonuses as
high as thirty per cent in addition to
their salary.
The cause of strikes during the pres
ent crop, according to the Bureau of
Labor of the Insular government,
which has just issued a report on it,
was due to the fact that at the end of
the last grinding season the employers
reduced wages to the same scale in
force before the 1915 strike and the
laborers were again compelled ito
strike to regain their former increases.
This report indicates that the wages
paid the sugar laborers are not at all
in proportion with the present pros
perity of the sugar men.

that the Yuma High School be opened
