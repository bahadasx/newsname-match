Typhus Epidemic Carried
Away 100,000 Thanks
America for Aid
By Henry Wood.
(L'nited Press staff correspondent.)
Rome, Mar. 23. Serbia has lost near
ly 1,000,000 of her 5,000,000 population
through death by the,, sword, by starva
tion or in the recent typhus epidemic,
the t'rinre Regent Alexander informed
the United Press today.
The remaining 4,000,000 face starva
tion. It is to save them from the great
est calamity of history that Prince
Alexander, Prime Minister Pachitch and
the foreign minister have begun a tour
of allies capitals. They hope to "se
cure military action ill the Balkans that
will assure the restoration of their na
tive country.
"Terrible as have been the losses in
our army, they have been vastly less
than our Civil losses," said the prince
regent. During the first two Austrian
invasions of 1014, practically the en
tiro civilan population In the devastat
ed districts was either massacred or
carried off into captivity in Austria.
"Then came the typhus epidemic car
rying off more than 100.000. Hardly
had this been overcome when the Ger
mans invaded last October. Hundreds
of thousands more either fell before the
invaders or fled." ,
Prince Alexander realized, he said,
that only by keeping intact Serbia's
fighting forces could lie hope to redeem
his country from its enemies. For
this reason everything else was aban
doned during the disastrous retreat in
to Albania.
No Means of Existence.
The aged King Peter, suffering in
tensely from the hardships of the le
treat through the mountains left his
armed forces in command of the sou.
Prince Alexander refused to leavv ihe
Albanian coast until the last Se-.bia.i
soldier had been transported to Corfu,
or elsewhere. ,
"With the Serbian army which re
treated before the combined Gerinar.,
urti'tiin and Bulgarian foro.rs vas'.'y
I'upeiior in number ami equipment to
their own, there retreated th'insr.nds
upon thousands of women, children and
old nun," said Prince Alexander. "Ke

''information reaching us(fr)m .Ser

TO BE PAVED BY CITY
Hard Surface Will Cost Prop
i erty Owners 60 Cents Per
Square Yard
A hard Hurface pavement on the Port
land road leading from the Fairgrounds
inside the city limits was practical!
assured this morning by the state
I board of control promising to furnish
the labor necessary for the sub-smiling
of the street. The work will be dono
cither by asylum inmates or convicts
and the city will furnish the gunrjls in
either case. This-will provide only for
the grading of the street, however, mid
it i-s not proposed to employ convict
or asylum labor for laying the hard
surface top dressing. A committee, con
sisting of Mavor Hanev O. White, F.
B. Southwick,H. W. Hatch and Conn
cilman J. A. Mills appeared beforo the
board of control at the meeting mil
urged state assistance to secure a con
tinuous hard surface pavement from th't
city proper to the fairgrounds.
The property owners y.ctitionr'd for a
pavement to cost not more than 00
cents per square yard and a' pu'sdit
it is proposed by the vmniit'ic that
the city of Salem or ou'.ode tour.-es
make up the excess cost over 00 c-nts
per yard, it is prohtitlc, lir.'Vev"-, that;
the city will pay the' bill T.ntt year
the state highway commission oicd to
donate $2,000 toward the paving of
this road but the attorney general ruled
that the. state could donate no funds for
roads inside the corporate limits of any
city. The present plan avoids this con
flict with the law by appropriating only
labor which is not prohibited by tne
statutes.
The city will lay the pavement by
day labor and the asphaltic top ill be
prepared in a plant'to be purchased by
the city or the one rented by the cm n
ty last year which is now in place en
Highland avenue a short distance from
the scene of operations on the i nrtiiind

Market Remained Dull
With Prices Slightly Off
New York. 'March 2.1 The New
York- Evening Sun's financial review
today said:
Despite denials and modifications of
original reports, peace influences still
lingered today, and in addition the
market was restrained by the unfavor
able turn of affairs in Mexico.
Uncertainty was the keynote of the
entire session. It was reflected in thu
halting and hesitating government. First
prices, except Mexican Petroleum,
Smelting, Refining, Greene Canaden
Copper and Southern Pacific averaged
higher, and various pools tried to ad
vance war stocks under the theory that
the Mexican situation would necessitate
henvv munitions orders. The argument
failed.
Although conspicuous specialties
moved up a trifle in early dealings, the
improvement was not maintained
Mexican Petroleum broke five points,
Baldwin Locomotive, Crucible Steel and
American Locomotive reacted u point
or two.
Conditions were not changed during
the later dealings. Dullness character
ized the afternoon.

Gencrnl Kuropatkin is bringing up
still heavier forces to smash German
railway positions, but Berlin claims
that all charges to d.ite havo been re
pulsed. Ihe extension of tne eastern front
ght in has made the battle there rival
that at Verdun, where there was a lull
last night, according to both French
and German st.iteinenls.
Berlin claimed rapture, of fortified
heights limit h oS Huueourt, where 440
French were captured. There were un
important, changes elsewhere. Paris ad
mitted losing a portion of Huueourt
hill.
Petrograd officially announced that
il lie Sl.iv attacks dented the German
line in six places. It was repotted un
officially that the battle was raging
most furious 40 miles south of Dvinsk.
Whether this smash is the beginning
of a great Slav offensive or merely a
demonstration to relievo Teuton pres
sure against Verdun has not yet been
determined by military critics. Tiie
London Post's Petrograd correspondent
declared it was tho commencement of a
"great Russian move." Ho pointed
out that Kuropatkin hns tremendous
forces at his command.
Other Petrograd messages declared
the attack was an attempt to batter in
tho dangerous German wedge at
Devinsk, removing the threat of a Ger
man offensive there when the weather
bcomes more favorable.
Northwest of Verdun the Germans
are apparently striving their utmost to
capture the dominant height in the
Avocourt region. F.merging from the
woods, the Buvarians charged across on
open plain which was raked by the firo
of many French guns. The swoop was
partly successful. Bavarians giined a

Evidence of Minister's Good
ness Displayed Error In
the Kitchen
Chico, Cul., March 2:'.. It was like
circus day here when tho jury in Rev.
Madison Slaughter's trial on ehargo of
attacking Gertrude Lamson, arrived
todav to look over the scenes of tho al
leged offenses.
A curious throng gathered at the
depot when u special train came in car
rying Judge Gregory, (lie jury court of
ficials, Rev. Slaughter, his wife and a
number of other interested parties.
The principals entered automobiles
and proceeded through tho main streets
followed by 15 other machines Every
storekeeper ran into the road to see
.Slaughter as the long parndo moved
slowly through the business district.
Crowds lined the way.
Slaughter, with arms grimly folded,
his wifo at his- side, rode in the ton
neau of a leading motor. Arrived at
; the scene, the jury toured Slaughter's
home, and also the houses of Mrs. Wid--
den and of Gertrude Ijimson s parents.
Fluttering always beforo the eyes of
the. jurors as they investigated tho
Slaughter cottage were Ruth and Naomi
Slaughter, the pastor's daughters and
Mrs. Clark Camper. Asv the jury
strolled through orchard and house the
girls gathered flowers, fed chickens
and rabbits mid busied themselves with
household tasks.
Inside the cottage the jurors found
many religious mottoes on tho wulls, a
Bible open on the center table, and
other evidences of a typical country
parsonage.
Filtering the barn where one of the
alleged offenses is said to have been
committed, the jurors closely inspected
it.
At the home 0f the Lamson family
they found Mrs. Lamson baking bis
cuits. There was a photograph of
Slaughter on the wall, flanked by
biblical quotations. A hymn book was
prominently displayed on Gertrude's
piano.
When the twelve men, in whose hands
Slaughter's fate rests, were about to
j enter a room, scene ot an allegeii at
! tuck, tho prosecution lawyers took a
peek into it first, then objected They
j claimed the chamber had beea changed
to resemble a workroom, with piles of
washing and junk scattered around.
Judge Gregory decided the jury
couldn't look in.
After their inspection the jurors re
turned to Oroville. The taking of lesti-
l mony will be resinned tomorrow. Argu
ments probably will begin Monday.
GALE AT SAN FRANCISCO
San Fruncisco. Mar. 2.'! Ocean steam
ers were unable to enter San Francisco
I bay todav, because of a terrific galo
' which made the bar break so heavily it
I was deemed dangerous. The ivg freigh
ter (Jcoi'fiuii of the American Hawaiian
I line, from New York, tried to filler,
but was forced to turn back.
On this point, all Mexicans arc
agreed, mining and railway men say.
These men fenr that Oenerul Carranza,
in his effort to stamp out Villa for
ever, is about to prevent another revo
lution by seizing the mines and
fields, now owned by Americans and
other foreigners.
The action of Governor P. F.llina Cn'
les of Sonora state, in proposing to re
call all state grants mid revising the!
status o'f' claims is only B forerunner to
rid Mexico of American financiers who
Mexicans believe, are sapping tho
country's wenlth.
According to de facto government of
ficials winking under Cnllcs, federal
grants will not be affected. But in
terested Americans epriss fear thnt
the system to be spread to all states
of Mexico and the plan of taxes, etc.,
will be such us to make work by Ameri
cans impossible.
In order to rid the country of Vll'iv.

Unless the American vanguard re
