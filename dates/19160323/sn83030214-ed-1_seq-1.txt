LONDON MARKET IS "CURIOUSLY
CHEERFUL" OVER PEACE RUMORS
By FRANCIS W. HIRST.
Krlilor "Ihr Kt-nnomial." lonrlnn.
. 1.? ' 4 U*
London. March 22.?The money market il firm under the* tax
tax-gatherers' screw. The stocK market is curiously cheerful. I judge
from last night's "We?tm;r,?.ter Gazette" and other signs that official
sentiment is gradually being converted to the po'siblity of a atis
factory peace settlement in the not far distant future.
There was a hopeful sentence in Premier Asquith'? last speech,
but M. Ribot. the French Finance Minister, went even further on
Friday night, for he said: "It i- permissible, without ?boaating, with?
out vain optimism, to perceive the end oi this horrible war."
"It i?. permissible, without boasting, without illusion and without
vain optimism, to perceive tfie end of this horrible war."
This view has undoubtedly found its way to the Stock Exchange
A well known jobber told me to-day that honorable peace was not
only desired, but expected, and certainly prices in some maikets ap?
pear to reflect an optimism which expenditure, debt and impending
taxation would not account for.
I hear from neutral visitors that Berlin is very shabby, but stub?
born, and Vienna bright and lively, but tiied of war.
