The death of Felix Martinez re
moves from the stage of life one of
the really noted figures of the south
west and one who has played a con
spicuous part in the development of
this section. As a statesman and a
financier ho had few eipuils, and his
loss will be felt nowhere more keenly
than in his native state of New Mex
ico, which was the beneficiary of
some of his ablest efforts.
Mr. Martinez was born in Taos on
the 28th day of March, lSaT, and was
therefore only a week short of 9
years of ago at the time of his death.
He was the son of Felix T. and Ueyes
Cordova- Martinez, and was a descend
ant of General Felix. Martinez, who
was governor of New Mexico in 1715.
He was educated by private teachetR
and in tlte private schools of Mora
and Denver, and was recognized by
all who knew hiin as a profound
scholar and student of public affairs.
On .September 24, 1SS0, Mr. Mar
tinez was married to Miss Virginia
Duster in Das Vegas, and for some
time afterwards was engaged in mer
cantile business in Las Vegas. In 1SS6
he sold out his mercantile business

JUSTIFIES SEIZURE OF

Replying to the formal protest of the
I'nited States against the seizure of
American securities, tlx- liritish gov
ernment will give to Ambassador
Page an informal interim answer in
which Great I'.ritain will claim the
right to make such seizures because
their sale by Germans' gives them
credit and this places the bonds in
the same category as gold shipments.
Ambassalor Page hus presented a
number of specific complaints to the
liritish foreign office in behalf of
American claimants of the seized se
curity's, but no reply showing what
disposition the Hritish government in-tetids-to
make in these cases has yet
been received. It is understood the
ambassador will press for an early
re-ply.
There is, a disinclination in official
circles to make any statement regard
ing the possible fate of these seized
securities as they constitute a con
traband case which has no precedent,
and the government here is unques

Pershing's Reports to General
Funston Tell Nothing of
Troop Movements Since
Last Monday,
IRV MORNIN9 JOURNAL RPfdAL. If ARCO WIRRl
San Antonio, Texas, March 22.
What progress tleneral Pershing lias
made in his pursuit of Villa since
Monday was not known at (leneral
Funston's headquarters today. A re
port from tbneial Pershing was re
ceived here today, but it dealt with
affairs of last Monday, saying that it
had been reported to him that Villa
and the Carra nz.'i troops were engaged
near Namiunipi.
At -the time a detachment of the
S"venlh cavalry had reached Cruces.
only a few miles north of Naini'iuipa
and one of the aeroplanes sent south
from Casus Grandes then wastjn com
munication with that force. Whether
the Americans came into contact with
Villa's men yesterday or today was
merely guess work here.
The aeroplane whose driver is be
lived to have been Lieutenant Gorrcll,
reported missing .south of Casus
Crandcs, was last seen going over
Colonia Juarez, a settlement near
Casus Grandes, according to (leneral
Pershing's report. All but one of the
avlalion squadron are accounted for,
according to reports received by Gen
eral iFunston. These reports show
two other machines temporarily out
of commission because of accident.
General Funston has no doubt that
in their own uuy the Carranza troops
are co-operating in the pursuit of
Villa, but between the American forces
and the Mexican forces there has
been no comthunicatlon and neither
side has knowledge of the details of
the other's plans.
The greater part of the Mexican
newspapers that have reached here
have counselled their readers to re
main calm and have refrained from
criticism of the I'nited States for send
ing American troops into Mexico. (Hie
of the exceptions was 10 1 Deinocrulia
published in Chihuahua.
I'lider the caption "The Crown of
Treason," it attacked Villa for attack
ing Columbus, but continued:
"We condemn and protest in the
most energetic manner against the in
vasion by the Yankees of our terri
tory; for although they may consider
Villa as a political personality and a
national representative, they cannot in
any manner consider his assault on
Columbus, N. M., as an offense of one
nation against another, and on this
account the passage of American
troops over the I outulary line cannot
have any justification and should he
taken as an act of violence or if pre
ferred, as an act of Wilsonian nervous
ness." Kl Demnerata added that " the good
relations existing between the consti
tutionalist government and the White
House should not be sundered and war
declared until all the formalities of
right which precede sin h a declara
tion shall have been gone through."
