said were of an wcindiary character.
Gen. Bell said thai he did not in
tend to have information of "prepara

advance of their execution. The gen
eral was investigating the report that
the Carranza garrison at Juarez,
across the river from El Paso, had de
serted to the Villa cause.
Later, on the report of Lieut. Lewis
of the Provost Guard, that outwardly
all was peaceful in Juarez, the cen

dispatch which was ordered held.
This dispatch. Gen. Bell said, greatly
exaggerated the ordinary precautions
he was taking and would have Iecu

(By Review Leased Wire.)
NASHVILLE, Tenn., March 22. A
ball of yarn, lighted and thrown by a
boy into dry grass started a conflagra
tion in Nashville at noon today, which
was not under control until late this
afternoon, after 35 residence blocks
I had been swept by the fire. The loss
is estimated at $1,555,000. A wind
wind driving at 50 miles an hour fan
ned the burning grass into flames
which quickly caught a planing mill
and leaped from building to building
until at least a hundred buildings had
burned. The big Warner Public
School and churches were reduced to
ruin.
Tonight it is estimated that at least
35.000 are homeless. National guard
called by Governor Rye went on duty
in the fire zone late this afternoon
and will remain there for several days
to aid in relief work.
Eight hundred children were at their
studies in the Warner school when the
flames leaped into that block. The
teachers continued the lessons and did
not dismiss school until after sparks
had set fire to the window casings and
the cupolas of the building, when the
children were dismissed. They made
their escape safely although many
had to pass through the fire zone in
order to get home. Later the building
was burned to the ground. The borne
of the Little Sisters of the Poor was
burned. Two women were seriously
burned in escaping from their resi
dences through the .flames. Another
was struck by furniture thrown from
upper windows.
At 11 o'clock this morning the wind
was driving through Nashville at a
rate of 52 miles.
Registration for the primary and
city election opens tomorrow morning.
Announcement to this effect is car
ried in this morning's Review. It
starts, in so far as the actual voting
is concerned, the first step in the pro
cess of intermittent, yet regular, chang
ing in Bisbee's municipal . officialdom.
According to the statement of City
Attorney Flanigan, made some weeks
ago, it will not be necessary for those
who registered 8nd voted at the city
election two years ago to register,
prior to the primary. The registra
tion, of 1914, will be sufficient. It
will be necessary, however, to register
again before voting in the final elec
tion, which is called for May 22.
There appears to be some confu
sion, regarding the registration in
Bisbee. This is particularly so in that
many people think because they regis
tered at the precinct, county and
state election in 1914, but who did
not vote in the spring at the city
election, should be able to vote in the
primary. This is not the case, accord
ing to the city officials.
As a consequence, those who are
not on the city election register, will
have to qualify before the primary or
on the primary day. City Clerk But
ler has announced that he will be in
his oflice March 28 and will furnish
certificates to those who have not
registered prior to that date and who
wish to vote in the primary. With a
certificate, obtained even on March
2R. there will be no difficulty in being
able to vote.
Another question that has arisen in
several quarters pertains to the re
cently enacted statute, regarding par
tisan primary voting. It will be re
membered that two years ago there
was considerable agitation, especially
in Democratic ranks, over the suppo
sition that many Republicans entered

WASHINGTON, March 22. Final I
action on the Hay army increase bill
was in sight tonight when the House
adjourned. With only two important
sections remaining to De discussed,
passage of the measure somtime to
morrow is assured.
The bill will come uu in the Senate
Monday. Chairman Chamberlain, opna.-o been spreading
the Senate Military Committee, an-
Bounced today th3t he would await
the arrival of the House bill, and give
and ask for its immediate considera
tion in the Senate.
As a preliminary step on army
legislation the Senate passed during
the ilav. hv a vnle nf ?,Q tn Iho hill I
doubling the Deace strength of the!
cadet corps at West Point Academy.
A similar measure, applying to the
Naval Academy, was signed by the
President.
The Hay bill has not been altered
in any of its broad aspects during the I
three day struggle in the House w ith j
amendments. Chairman Hay has been
defied only once, having approved
every other change in the detail of
the measure. It is very certain the
bill will go to the Senate as. framed
by the committee.
One section still to be disposed of,
however, is the vital element of the
whole army plan proposed. It is the
militia pay provision, under which the
bill is expected to provide a force of
national guardsmen with five years as
a substitute for the continental army
proposal.
The section had been read when
representative Gardner, republican of
Massachusetts, presented an amend
ment proposing as a substitute the
volunteer provision of the Chamber
lain bill.
Another important section remain
ing is that authorizing construction of
a plant to produce atmosphere nitro
gen for use in explosives. It is cer
tain to cause extended debate. The
blouse refused twice today to insert
in the bill a provision designed to
prohibit the use of national guard by
states for strige dmy. Representative
London, of New York, rocialist. and
Representative Keating, of Colorado.
democrat, were met by points of order
when they offered amendments for
this purpose. The House overwhelm
ingly sustained the ruling of the
chairman. The struggle wHl be re
newed tomorrow but there is no pro
spect that the House will change its
mind.
The most important amendment
placed on the bill was a suggestion
by Carl Hayden, of Arizona. It pro
vides that when a regiment of nation
al guard is Bent to the front, a fresh
battalion be organized from the na
tional guard reserve to take the regi
ment's place and to train recruits for
the fighting lines. Under this sys
tem, if the entire guard were called
out, a force one third its total strength
would immediately take its place at
home to maintain order, secure and
train recruits and insure that the
fighting regiment would be kept up to
full strength without being hampered
by levies of ram recruits
It is possible a similar system willjpany in that district. Mr. William
be devised for the regular army.

military governor of Sonora, at his
temporary headquarters in Agua Prie
ta, opposite here. '
"These men were ordered from
Mexico only after we i.ad proved be-
yond doubt that they had been active
in s'.ipporting the Cientifico faction,"
General Calles stated. "They have
been urging the ignorant classes jn
their districts to act so as to compel
intervention in Mexico by the United
States.
"I am very sorry that it was neces
sary for the state to take this action,
but some such action was nece-ssary
to prevent disorders, and possible dif
ficulties.
"At the same time, I wish every
one to understand that the deporta
tion of these prie.sts is not intended
by the Constitutional government of
Sonora as an unfriendly act toward
the Catholic Church of the state. The
men were sent away merely as un
desirable residents.
"Should the Catholic Church desire
to send good priests to Mexico to
take the places of these six priests,
the authorities of the state will wel
come them. Furthermore, they will
continue to be welcomed and aided in
the work so long as they confine their
activities to the church.
"It would be an act of what you
call it? folly for Mexico to attempt
to keep all priests from Mexico when
most of the people are Catholics. The
priests are needed, their work will be
of much good, but they must not
meddle in politics."
Gen. Calles. through Ives G. Lel
evier, consul here for the de facta
government, added that he also was
sorry that the priests had not left
Sonora quietly without stating that
they had been deported. It was hard,
he said, to be just to all, to keep
peace in the country and at the same
time to keep from being misunder
stood. Scouts returned today from trips
through the passes in the mountains
along the Sonora-Chihuahua state
line. They brought word, he said,
that a Villa band had been sighted
and that Villa was not planning, for
the present at least, to attempt any
invasion into Sonora.

In Washington On
Herrerera's Actions

Are Greatly Worried Over
the Affair.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. March 22. Grave
apprehension regarding the outcome
of the American expedition into Mexi
co in pursuit of Villa was felt for the
first time in Washington tonieht. af
ter receipt of a dispatch from Gen.
Funston saying a report had reached
him that Carranza troops, under Luis
Herrera, had revolted and aligned
themselves with Villa.
Gen. Funston did not disclose the
source of his information and o far
as could be learned, no confirmation
had reached the department -r the
Mexican embassy.
If Herrera an dhis troops have join
ed Villa, some of the officials believe
other Carranza commanders and
troops may follow their example. In
such an event, the United Slates and
the de facto government of Mexico
would find themselves confronted with
a situation so serious that its possibili
ties could hardly be estimated.
SAN ANTONIO WORRIED
SAN ANTONIO. March 22. The re
port that General Herrera. command
ing 2000 men at Chihuahua, ltad a
ligned himself with Francisco Villa
against the United States, was teceiv
ed with grave concern by General
Funston and his staff. The long inter
vals between General Pershing's re
ports are had. keyed up the tension a
bit, although Ceneral Funston and his
chief-of-staff continued to profess the
belief that all was well with the troops
below Cnsas Grandes but the report
from Chihuahua made significant any
anxiety that might have been felt con
cerning General Pershings operations.
Officially and unofficially the opinion
entertained here was that if Herera
has joined Villa the international sit
uation might be made so complicated
that the pursuit of Villa would be re
garded as incidental.
Consul Belt ran of Carranza's govern
ment received no report of the report
ed revolt .of Herrera and he was in
clined to laugh at it as a "border ru
mor." According to the version here
Herrera. when removed from com
mand, had immediately taken
to alienate his garrison.
That Carranza has enough
troops in northern Mexico to
steps
loyal
drive j
him from the City of Chihuahua if he
attempts to hold the place, was be
lieved by military men here, but it
was feared that the occupation of Chi
huahua was not his plan. Observers
ht-re see a possible connection with his
plan in the 'n'erruption of communi
cation between Casas Grandes and
Juarez yesterday.
PROCTOCOL DRAFTED
WASHINGTON. March 22. A draft
of the proctocol by Gen. Carranza to
govern the operations of the American
expedition in Mexico was agreed upon
late today oy A.-ling Secretary Polk
and Eliseo Arredondo, ambossador
designate. It was forwarded at onca
to Carranza for approval and is ex
pected to be in effect within a few days
ivtails of the proposed convention
will be withheld until signed. It is
known, however, that it is designed to
minimize the possibility of misunder
standing between the two governments
by setting forh the reasons of the ex
traordinary circumstances and pre
scribing as far as possible the meas
ures to be pursued by the Mexican
and American troops in pursuit of ban
dits. The United Stales government real
ized fully the difference in the posi
tion of Gen. Carranza. who. with many
foes in his own country, faces the task
of suppressing the alarm spread a
mong the Mexican people by the pres
ence of a foreign army on Mexican
soil.
Consequently, the proctocol has been
drawn with a view to strengthening
the hand of the de facto government,

(By Review
I COLUMBUS, March 22. (Pa.-sed by censcrl General Luis Herrera, un
j til recently Carranza military governor of Chihuahua, has renounced Carran-
za and announced himself in favor of Villa, taking the field in western Chi
huahua with 2.000 troops, according to reliable information received l.ere
tonight.
The exact place at which General Herrera's troops are encamped was
not indicated in the message whih reached Columbus from a source that
always has been found thoroughly reliable. It is believed however, that the
troops, most of whom recently constituted the Carranza garrison at Chihua
hua City, tonight are some place in the distance between the San Pedro and
Chihuahua and are preparing to work north and west toward the American
punitive expedition, now in the field under General Pershing. The senriment
of the people in this district, which lies about seventy miles directly east of
the Guerrero region, in which Villa began his days as an outlaw, is strongly
in favor of the bandit chieftain. His success in withstanding Porfirio Diaz'
rurals for eight years, during all of which time there was a heavv price on
his head, won the loyalty of the peons

The report marks an important de
velopment in the American campaign
tto capture Villa, according to experi
enced observers of Mexican military
affairs. It is pointed out that ;he re
ported renunciation of the Carranza
standard by Herrera is the first to be
made by an important military leader
of the de facto government since the
American troops crossed the interna
tional line a week ago today.
The possible defection of other Car
ranza leaders who have been reported
wavering in their loyalty to the govern
ment of the "First Chief" was food for
much discussion.
No reports were received as to the
arms and equipment of the Herrera
command, but it is pointed out. he can
cause the American expedition much
trouble by pursuing tactics of guerilla
warfare in a country with whion his
troops are thoroughly familiar, and in
which it is believed they have the sym
pathy of the people.
General Herrera was military gover
nor of Chihuahua at the time of the
massacre of IS Americans at Santa
Ysabel several weeks ago. It was re-
ported that Carranza relieved hini of
his command because of drunkenness
several weeks ago.

EL PASO. March 22. The censor
i ship who for two days has enveloped
the Mexican situation as far as a in
definite news of the pursuit of Villa is
concerned, gave fresh reports from
various sources of grave disaffection
among the Carranza troops. On the
border, at least, it is firmly believed
that soldiers of the First Chief are far
from giving any real cooperation to
the American fore. It is admitted
that Carranza and some of his lieuten
ants are sincere in wishing to avoid
friction with the United Slates, but it
is no believed the head of the de facto
government represents the sentiments
of his army.
