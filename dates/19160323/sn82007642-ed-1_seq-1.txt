Mr. J. H. Collett, now of Aus
tin, Texas, who seventy years a
go left Caldwell county for the
Lone Star State, in writing to
his cousin, Miss Jennie Coffey, of
Boone, embraces the following,
which will be read with interest.
The writer is now $0 years old;
the letter was written in his own
hand, and we consider it splen
did, his age considered:
In my late reminiscent letter
to you 1 told you of a man nam
ed Craig who had a camp on
Grandfather mountain, though I
did not tell you that he was a
hunter and trapper of game, his
mode of hunting being to slow
track it.
When in quest of game a noose
was put around bis dog's neck,
and was held or led, and when
the dog scented the tracks of
game he made it known by his
actions, and when the hunter
found the tracks the dog wa9 al
lowed to lead off in the right di
rection without making noise,
the hunter's object then being, if
possible, to slip up within shoot-
ing distance oi tne game wuuoui
. oeing aiBCQvereu.
Craig delighted iq telling about
adventures he had with wounded
bear that looked fool-hardy. He
sometimes went into fights with
his butcher knife when his dog
was in danger of being squeezed
to death, for if he had taken time
to re-ioaa nis gun ana bqoov
again bis dog would have been
dead. There was no road for sev-
erai mnes irom nis camp, anu
when he had a sufficient amount
of dear hams, bear meat, and fur
sicinstomaKea trip, n pacKeu juneshehada paralytic stroke
it on horses down to the settle- rora which she never entirely re
ment where he found market for covered and 80 wasan easy

an uv uttu.
Craig'e father and mother in
their latter days took an orphan
girl to raise. In the course oi time
the old lady died, and some time
after that event the old man mar-
ried the girl, and on that occa-
sion the old man was reported to
have said in part in substance,
the following: That he had three
months of birthdays (he was
then in his 90th year); tUattruiu
the time of his first niarnaue be
had tanned the leather and made
all the shoes. Baddies and har-
ness ever used on his place; that
his young wife was 18 years old,
and from the tune she was a mere
girl she had carded, gpun, wove,
cut and made all the clothes she
ever wore; that she was a good
cook and house keeper, and tne
best and prettiest, girl ne ever
knew; that she bad promised to
take care oi him and, u need De to
nurse him as long as he lived, and
when he died she would own all
he had left. If I ever knewthegiv
en names of any of the Craigs re
ferred to I do not now remember
them.1
The last time I was on Grand
father mountain was in the fall
of 1838, a few days before we
started to move from one mile
below Colletsville to the Cherokee
country. 1 went with my father
others to Mp gatherup
drive home our range stock.
When we started from the moun-
tain, a. little sleek-fat anweaned

what the cause of that disease is?
Tl not, I think it would be anoth-
er feather in the cap of Mr. John
P. Arthur, your local Western
North Carolina Historian, to put
some scientist to work on t h e
iob. From mv earliest recollec-
tion there has been theories in
abundance, but as tar as I know
nothing more to date.

. FOR FLETCHER'S
IN MEMORY.
Two Former Wataagans Piss ta Their
Reward n Idaho.
James M. MeGuire was born in
North Carolina March 20, 1850,
and was married to Miss Marga
ret Whittington Aug. 1, 1872, at
about which time he joined the
Methodist church. He passed to
the Great Beyond Dec. 29, 1915,
at his home at Tekean, Idaho.
He was for many years, as a
number of your readers will re
member, a resident of Watauga
county, but in the spring of 1902
he came to Tekean, Idaho, where
he identified himself with the
M. E. Church and was always
found working for the advance
ment of right and justice, and
was a firm advocate of the broth
erhood of man. He was also an
honored member of the 1. 0. 0. F
under whose auspices the funeral
was held, a large concourse of
friends and relatives gathering
to pay the last tribute of respect
to one vwho had been counsellor
and friend. His last illness was

Victars Despite Bif Odds.
(George Irwin, in .New Yom Evening
Tle?ram )
The victorv of Gideon's 300
over 120.000 Midianites, and the
activities of Sampson with that
jawbone, as related in the Book
of Judees. are fair indications
that the Lord is not always on
the side of the big battalions,
Profane history affords many in
stances of long odds. Ten thou
sand Greeks routed 120,000 Per
sians at Marathon, and 300
brave Spartans died whiledefend
ing the pass of Thermopylae a-
gainst 1,500,000 (more or less)
other brave Persians during the
famous invasion of Greece by
Xerxes.
The Scots have one to their I
credit over England when in 1314
Robert Bruce and 30,000 of his
countrymen routed 100,000 of
their southern neighbors.
AtCrecyin 1346 30,000 En-
glish proved too many for 100,-
000 French, and nome Years later
at Poictiers the Black Prince,
with 12,000 men, disposed of
the King of France and five times
that number principally by the
prowess of his archers.
Two hundred and fifty Irish-
raen held the Shannonlbridge at
Athlone against 18.000 English,
Dutch and Germans in 1691.
I'wo hundred of their number
fell, but the bridge wasdestroyed
before the others drew off.
Charles XII of Sweeden, with
9,000 men defeated an array of
60,000 Russians at JNarva.
As might be expected in the
wars between civilation and bar-
barism or semi-barbarism, the
victory was generally won by the
former against fearful odds.
If the Spanish chroniclers are
to be believed, Cortez defeated joy a good, Montana-made ci
200.000 Aztecs in the battle of gar, while reading a Montana
Otumba after he evacuated Mex-
ico City, or, as it was then called
Tenochtitlan. On this occasion
he could scarcely have mustered
200 Spaniards.
In India the British have had
their own share in this kind of
warfare. Robert ( live, with 3,-
000 men, defeated Surajah Dow-
lah's army of 50,000 at Plassy
in 1751, and Sir Robert Napier
tackled 30,000 Beloochees at I
Meanee with 2,800 men.
The longest odds in any mod
ern battle were faced, however,
by Garibaldi when at the battle
of Marsala in 1859, with 1,000
'red shirts," he attacked and de
feated 50,000 Austrians.
