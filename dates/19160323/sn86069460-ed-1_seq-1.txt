The reporU of the County Clerk.
Circuit Clerk. County Judge and
other officers were then read in
ppen court and approved, accept
ed and put to record.
The Judge then empanelled
the juries for the term and pro
ceeded to deliver a strong charge
to the grand jury. The Judge
touched heavily on "society gam
hlimr" as he was reported to
have done at . Madison ville and
Princeton, and also on all other
kinds of gambling, misdemean
ors and violations of the election
laws. He explained the different
decrees of crime, murder, man
slaughter and explained the dif
(1ferent penalties.
. The Court called attention to
the conspiracies for the control
of the price of tobacco and other
farm products and advised the
jury should they find any such
condition in Crittenden county
to call to their aid secret service
men which he felt sure Governor
Stanley would furnish if asked
to do so. The fish in streams
within the county must be pro
tected, no seine, net or trap be
ing permissable under the law.
Next to society gambling the
Judge was harder on cigarette
fiends that any other class of
citizen, putting him down pretty
low on the social ladder, also the
dealer who would supply them
or materials for making them
boys under 18 years of age.
The grand jury was especially
charged not to be a respecter o
persons but to hew to the line
let the chips fall where they
may. The Court called attention
to boot-legging, confederating
and banding together-mobs and
all such matters, saying truth
fully that there is no excuse for
such things if the juries and off
leers will do their duty.
The grand jurors for the term
are: J. B. Carter, Foreman, W,
C. Tyner, T. W. Davenport,
k Galen Dixon, Will U. Hughes,
Anthony Cooper, J. F. Cook, J.
S. Ainsworth, J. R. Postleweight

house to the section house at the
little station between Hermanas
and Columbus.
The bandits, as thty were
driven from Columbus, passed by
the ranch and set fire to the
house, burning it to the ground.
Mr. and Mrs. Cossitt had just
completed the erection of the
house and had not yet moved all
of their furniture from Columbus
to the new house. Their furni
ture was stored above the Miller
Drug store in Columbus, and this
building was also fired by the
bandits, completely destroying
all of the furniture.
Editors Note. We learn from
Louis Clifton, whose wife is a
sister of Frank Cossitt and who
has just returned from a visit to
her brothers and mother, that
the above report is untrue.

Hopkinsville, Ky., March 21
Christian county today voted a
$400,000 bond issue for good
roads by a majority of 3,127.
The vote was 4,007 for, to 1,-
1430 against, the proposition.
Only four precincts of the
thirty-two in the county went
against the proposition.
The city or Hopkinsville gave
a majority of 1,109 for the bond
issue. .
By agreement with the fiscal
court a commission was to be ap
pointed to have supervision of
the expenditure of the money
and the location of the roads to
be improved and the act of the
legislature giving fiscal courts
the right to appoint such com
mission was earnestly champion
ed by the member from Christ

Thus the fiscal court worked in
harmony with the Good Roads
association of Christian county
and gave the public confidence
that the proceeds of the bond is

expended.
