Asa Morgan, the popular , jan
itor of the Franklin school build
ing, who is convalescing from
" very severe attack of . the., grip,

merited compliment Tuesday af

pupils of each of the eight grades
occupying the building called on
him at his home on. South Broad
way and presented him with t
tempting assortment of the. daint
iest fruits. Mr. Morgan has held
the post of janitor for the school

comodating manner has endeared
him to teachers and pupils alike.

Hdh. Jas. N. Sharp, of Passaic,

editor, there . to work off the
groueh which has been accumu
lating on him during his confine
ment to his v home., While the

Former County Clerk Diei After
Long illness.
ohn P. Herrell, former county
deck of Bates county and- a
inent insurance man, died at
his home on West Ohio street in
this city, i Saturday, - March 18,
1916, at 5 o'clock a. m., after a
several month 's. illness, of a com
plication of heart and stomach
troubles. -
John F. Herrell, the son of Mr.
and Mrs. Allen Herrell, was born
at Butler, Mo., January 26, 1857,
and was reared to young man
hood in this county. He was unit
ed in marriage to Miss Maria
Burner October 23, 1880, and to
this union were born two chil
dren a son and a daughter, both
of whom survive. The son,
Qmrvf TTtil 1 ami 4-Via slaiirvli ai
v cut gi. j ttiiv.ii auu tiic uaugiibvi
Mrs. Etta Jenkins, both reside at
Adrian. Besides his children,
Mr. Herrell is survived by. his
witiow, an aaoptea aaugnter,
.Miss Eva Herrell ;. a brother,
William Herrell, of Johnstown,
and a sister Mrs: S. A. Letterer,
of Ft. Scott, Kansas.
Mr. Herrell engaged m the
mercantile business in Butler for
several years, later removing to
Adrian, where he engaged in the
insurance business. During his
residence in Adrian he served as
a member of the board of educa
tion. In 1902 the Democratic
party rewarded his long unself
ish party service with the nomina
tion for county clerk and he was
elected by a substantial majority
and served four years in this ca
pacity, faithfully and efficiently
and with high honor to himself
and his party. At the close of his
term as county clerk, Mr. Herrell
and his son, George, established
the J. F. Herrell & Son Insurance
agency in this city and in Adrian,
and established for their business
an enviable reputation tor service
and efficiency, Mr. -Herrell- re
maining in charge until only a
short time prior to his death.
John Herrell was a man of
strong moral character, able and
broad minded. Faithful to a
trust, honorable and conscientious
his friends throughout the county
were legion. His honorable, un
impeachable career as a county
official is an index to the manner
in .which John Herrell lived his
whole life. He will be sadly
missed, and the entire community
mourns with the bereaved family.
Funeral services, conducted by
the Rev. R. M. Webdell, were held
at the Ohio street Baptist church
Sunday afternoon annd interment
was made in Oak Hill cemetery
under the direction ot uiue flag
Lodge No. 190 K. of P. of which
lie was a charter member.
Popularity of IL & L. Associations.
In the evidence of the deserving
popularity of the Building and
Loan Associations of this state,
with both the borower and in
vestor, we will quote a statement
from a speech made before the
State League of Building and
Loan Associations, held at St.
Joseph, Missouri, September 24
and 25 1915, by S. T. Gresham
of Springfield, a former state su
pervisor of Building and Loan
Associations: .
"Six years ago we had 127,.
Building and Loan Associations
in Missouri with combined assets
of $9,000,000. Now we have 160
Associations, with total assets of
$20,000,000. A doubling of assets
in a period of six years is a
growth that should mean some
thing to those seeking a safe,
profitable savings institution."
BUTLER B. &. L. ASSOC N.
19-tf T. J. DAY, Sec.
Will Again Observe Clean-Up
eelc
T. A. Black, chairman of the
Butler "Clean-up and Paint-up"
committee is authority for the
statement that this city will again
this spring participate in the
generally observed clean-up week.
Nearly five tbousand cities in the
United States observed this week
in 1915, and the results, not only
in improved appearances, but in
the be'tterment of sanitary condi
tions generally has' popularised
this movement . throughout the
country to such an extent that it
will probably become aji estab
lished institution".
