Old Plot,
New Scenery I
Predicament of a Man Who Was
Robbed of His Clothes
By MAURICE BROWN PHIPPS
Copyright by Frank A. Munsey Co.
The newly risen moon was flooding
the steep path when Stotesworthy St.
John turned his back upon the radiant
sceue and wheezily stumbled up the
hillside.
He had been down to the point over
looking the bay to see the moon rise,
not because he cared particularly for
tnoourises or sunsets or for any of the
daily recurring phenomena of nature,
but because he considered it the prop
er thing for the perpetrator of a best
seller to do.
At all events, the other guests of
Cragside Hall seemed to expect It of
him. and he was nothing if not politic.
When one is forty-five, both in years
and waist measure, somewhat asth
matic and has to be careful about ex
posing a thinly thatched cranium to
the evening air, one does not linger
long over romantic memories aroused
by the silvery orb of night
Suddenly he became conscious of the
close proximity of something about
which he had many times glibly writ
ten, but with which he was entirely
unfamiliar—namely and to wit. a hard,
glistening object, one end of which
had seemed to Stoteswortby, before it
was pressed firmly against his nbdo
men, to resemble somewhat the en
trance to the Mammoth cave.
"Come across, cull," said the un
prepossessing person, a total stranger
to Stoteswortby, who appeared to be
fastened to the other end of the Mam
moth cave affair, "come across and
don't waste no time. I'm hungry."
Stoteswortby St John opened his
mouth and then closed it again. In
rapid succession he swallowed several
times.
"Come along, hurry up," he said, ex
erting a little more pressure on the
rear of Mammoth cave, "dig up your
wad. My fingers is gettin' cold, and
I'm liable to pull this trigger and bore
a little round hole right straight
, through your., liUl*. mm iek,
Dig up.''
"I—I have no money with me,"
Stoteswortby at last managed to fa!
ter. "I was playing golf this after
noon, and when I changed my clothes
I forgot"—
"I don't give a cuss about your so
cial engagements." rudely interrupted
the coarse person. "What I'm after is
some coin. Now, produce."
"But I tell you I have none," the
author persisted.
After convincing himself with agile
fingers, which, by the way, did not
seem at all affected by the chilly air.
that Stotesworthy's assertion regard
ing his present financial embarrass
ment was most accurate, the marauder
spoke just one word:
"Strip!"
"What!" Stotesworthy gasped. "Why,
I—why"—
"Strip!" tile other repeated, firmly.
"And hnrry up about it. You don't

think I'm goin' to have a holdup chalk
ed up ag'in me and get nothin' outer it.
do you? Them clo'es is good for a
plate o' beans, 1 gues£."
Slowly and sbiveringly Stotesworthy
began an undressing act that would
not have been tolerated upon any stage
in the country.
Coat, waistcoat, trousers, shirt, col
lar, tie and hat lay in a neatly arraug
ed heap at his feet, and clothed in
righteous indignation and very little
else lie awaited the further command
af the pitiless highwayman.
"You can keep them kicks." he said
contemptuously, indicating Stoteswor
ihy's custom made pumps. "They ain't
no good to me. and this hard ground
might hurt your little tootsies."
"Thank you." Stotesworthy humbly
replied.
Stotesworthy gently ground his teeth
In helpless rage. And then the coarse
one, after gathering up his new ac
quaintance's donation to the poor, did a
most singular thing.
He hurled the hard, shining imple
ment. one end of which had seemed to
Stotesworthy as the entrance to Mam
moth cave, against a large bowlder by
the side of the path.
It shattered into a thousand tinkling
pieces.
Stotesworthy St. John had been held
up, robbed, divested of his clothing
and his self respect by the menacing
muzzle of an empty whisky flask.
For many minutes after the robber's
last brutal laugh had floated back to
him on the evening breeze, Stoteswor
thy remained motionless, an un heroic
statue of humiliation and chagrin.
Stotesworthy calculated that it was
about 8 o'clock; the hotel was fully
half a mile away, and a few yards be
yond him. where the path debouched
from the shadow the firs and
spruces, the road was made dazzling
by the shimmering moonlight. He was
in something of a predicament.
To remain where he was meant to
court death in the unpleasant form of
pneumonia. To make a dash for it
meant death in a far more unpleasant
guise of ridicule.
To slip in unnoticed was practically
impossible, especially as be had not
the slightest acquaintance with the
rear of the hotel where an entrance
must be effected.
The sound of nearby feminine laugh
ter startied the humiliated author into
activity, and he scuttled iuto the near
est thicket like a frightened rabbit.
From this coign of vantage he cau
tiously peered out.
The laughter had emanated from a
group of persons who were walking
along the road leading to the hotel.
Cut what a peculiar assortment of
clothes.
One was arrayed in the costume of
colonial days, sword and all; another
had apparently deserted the fall round
up without discarding the sheepskin
chaps and sombrero bffore coming to
town; several were hidden In the volu
minous folds of nightgown affairs of
various' colors, and all wore masks.
Stotesworthy gazed in fascinated
amazement. There were other ridicu
lous costumes than his own abroad
that evening, and for a moment he felt
a little easier. And then a light dawn
ed upon him, and lie groaned aloud.
The last dance of the season—the
masquerade!
That's what it was. He bad forgot
ten all about it. And it would be 2
o'clock in the morning i>cforc the fools
would think of such a,thing as sleep;
hence the groan.
Silently and steal though not
''Çfîte so'Triconspicuous as an Indian
stalking his quarry, Stotesworthy St
John alternately crept and dashed to
ward the unsuspecting Cragside Ilall.
He took advantage of every bush
and bowlder in a manner that would
have been a credit to a boy scout, and
at last he paused for breath in the
very shadow of the hotel.
Cautiously he peered around the
corner and found tilgt he was looking
into what was unmistakably the clothes
drying yard of the establishment.
A sudden inspiration descended upon
the author, and, not stopping to con
sider the effect his sudden appearance
might have upon the laundress, he
made a dash for the first sheet which
met his eye.
As luck would have it the maid's
back was turned, and she did not see
Stoteswortby until, with his rotund
form partially hidden by the damp
sheet, lie passed her on the way to an
open door which, lie had shrewdly
guessed, opened into the laundry.
"Oh, heavens!" lie heard her whim
per ns she sank upon the pile of linen
in the basket at her feet and hid her
face in lier hands. . "I seen it again!
Somebody's goin' io die, I know!"
By sheer luck. Stotesworthy, stum
bling blindly about in the darkness of
the hotel basement, came across a stair
way unused since the addition to Crag
side Hall was built two seasons before.
He mounted to the door at tlie top
and cautiously turned the handle; it
was unlocked, nc opened the door a
crack and peered into a small apart
ment which lie did not remember of
ever having seen.
A young man, whom Stoteswortby
recognized as one familiarly called
Tommy by the younger feminine guests
of the hotel, was the only person with
in his range of vision.
King Solomon in all his glory was
never arrayed like Tommy. A dandy
of the court of Louis XV., or probably
Louis himself, lie appeared lo lie as he
stood by an open window anaebro
nistically inhaling an Egyptian ciga
rette.
It was a wonder that Stotesworthy
recognized him at all. notwithstanding
he had laid aside his mask, so be
wigged and berudled was he.
"Fsst!" Stoteswortby hissed. "Psst
Tommy!"
Tommy turned and stared curiously
at the door whence (he sound seemed
to come.
"What is it?" he asked. "What do
you want?" v
"Are you alone?" came in a guard
ed whisper. "What room is this, any
way?"
"Yes, I'm alone," Tommy answered,
"and this is a sort of cloak or ante
room; used to be the old office, I guess.
It opens into the ballroom. What's
ip:
"Can I get upstairs from here?"
Stotesworthy inquired in the same
hoarse whisper. "Get me upstairs with
out any one seeing me?"
"I don't know." (he courtier of Louis
XV. replied. "No. I don't believe you
can. Why?"
"This is why!" Stotesworthy exclaim
ed tragically and stepped into the
room.
"What—oh. you've lost your mask!
Is that it?" Tommy replied.
"Geo!" lie burst forth as be took in
a
the author's fantastic costume. "What
are you rigged up to represent, any
how—a Roman senator?"
Stotesworthy did not answer. He
was struck with another idea.
"Ha—yes, yes!" he said at last. "A
Roman senator, and I've lost my
mask !"
"I'll see if I can find another for
you." Tommy, unnecessarily agreeable,
volunteered.
"No. no; wait!" Stotesworthy ex
claimed. "I don't want a mask. You
see if there is any possible way I can
get out of here without any one see
ing me."
Tommy nodded and turned once
more to the door opening into a pass
age that led to tlie lobby, adjusting his
mask as he went.
Tiio iloor had scarcely closed behind
Tommy before it opened again, and his
gallant figure reappeared.
"Some one's coming down the pas
sage." lie explained. "Thought you'd
better get out of sight if you don't
want to bo recognized."
"Some one coming!" Stotesworthy
gasped. "Who is it?"
"How do I know?" the courtier of
Louis XV. demanded. "They're all

masked. Some women— Here, hide
hrHhls * *
Stotetsworthy, hurrying as fast as
the hobbled sheet wouid allow,
squeezed himself through the doorway.
Unfortunately, the courtier was far
too interested in trying to establish the
identity of the two masked women,
who at that moment entered from the
passage, to pay much attention to the
unhappy Stotesworthy, and he did not
notice that he was standing on a
corner of the Roman senator's toga.
Neither did the Roman senator notice
that anything was wrong until the
final squeeze play which carried him
through the narrow opening.
He had gone through with a sort of
rotary motion, something similar to
the famous revolving wedge of the
football field; this time, however, ex
ecuted *by a single player; something
of a feat in itself.
But. as fate would have it, lie had
rotated in the wrong direction; had put
a reverse English on himself, as it
were, with the result that tlie sheet, or
most of it, remained in the cloakroom.
Immediately upon Stotesworthy's dis
appearance Tommy took it upon him
self to slam the door. Again fate, in
the guise of a spring lock, played the
trouble burdened author a scurvy trick.
The bang of the door wa3 followed
Immediately by a vicious bombardment
of knocks and kicks from Stoteswor
thy's side.
"Open this door!" he bellowed. "You
—you—open this door, I say!"
"S-sh!" cautioned Tommy in a stage
whisper. "Wait just a minute; they're
still here."
"Open this door, I tell you. I don't
care who's there," screamed the author,
seemingly in a fury over something.
"Open this door, you fool, or I'll break
your confounded neck."
"Ob, if that's the way you feel about
it," Tommy returned, with maddening
coolness, "you can stay In there till
you calm down a bit."
The orchestra bad ceased playing,
and a curious hush had fallen upon the
dancers, so that the courtier of Louis
XV. heard distinctly the ensuing out
burst from the other side of the door.
"Open this door!" Stoteswortby
shrieked in crescendo tones. "I'm in
the ballroom!"
Even with that horrifying announce
ment Tommy failed to grasp the situa
tion. He had not noticed Stoteswor
thy's toga upon which he was still
standing, and even if lie had that was
no reason wiiy he should know that a
stout, asthmatic author was giviug a
free demonstration of athletic under
wear in a crowded ballroom.
Tommy felt peevish. That was no
way to talk to a courtier of Louis XV..
who was doing his liest to assist. Let
him get out by himself.
"Stay there, then!" lie called out and
passed down the passage to the lobby.
The first train to New York left
Bayswater. the station used by the
guests at Cragside Hall, at 5:30 in the
morning.
If was not a popular train, nor a
fast train, but it was the one elected
by Stotesworthy St. John to carry him
and his effects away from the seaside.
For tile past three years Mr. St.
John's summers have been spent at
Atlantic City, and he rarely leaves his
hotel in the evening unaccompanied.
Cleaning Lace,
Lace that is too delicate to be wash
ed in the usual way Can be cleaned in
this way: Make a strong soapsuds of
some good soap and allow the lace to
remain in it for several hours at least,
although it is well to shake it out oc
casionally. A wide mouthed bottle is
most convenient to handle. When the
lace is thoroughly soaked let the soapy
water out of the bottle and keep add
ing clean water until the soap has all
been removed from the lace. Do not
handle the lace at all; shaking the bot
tle will rinse it thoroughly.
If the lace is narrow wind it round a
bottle that has been covered with a
[liece of soft flannel, and do not re
move it until it is dry. If it is too
wide to care for in that way dry it on
n large cushion. First cover the cush
ion with a heavy towel, then pin the
points of tile lace in place and allow it
to dry. It is better not to use steel
pins on account of the danger from
rust When dry the lace will look like
new.—Youth's Companion.
Famous Temple and Statue.
Since about the year 732 the grand
ceremony of Knigeu, or "opening the
spiritual eye of the statue," has been
celebrated but five times at the temple
commonly known as the Daibutsu of
Nara, at Tokyo. The original statue
has suffered grievously since 752.
Once, in 855, the head dropped off.
Since then it lias suffered twice from
fire, and upon each occasion the head
was destroyed. The statue in its sit
ting posture measures fifty-three and a
half feet, the length of the face being
sixteen feet. Tlie two Bodhisattvas
flanking the Daibutsu are as high as
thirty feet. The temple is 188 feet in
frontage and 10«; feet in deptli and is
known as the largest wooden building
in Japan, though it is much smaller
than the original, built 1,100 years ago.
it was not built to protect, the statue
from lining exposed to the weather,
hut the si a tue was made to euslirine
as the chief figure of the temple.
Tool Chest Courtship.
"It is 'plane' that 1 love you," he
began.
"Is that on the 'level?' " she asked.
"Haven't I always been on the
'square' with you?"
"But you have many 'vises,' " she re
monstrated.
"Not a 'bit' of it," he asserted.
"What, made you 'brace' up?" she
queried coquettishly.
"The fact that I 'saw' you," be re
[died, with a bow.
"I ought to 'hammer', you for that,"
she answered saucily.
"Chine and sit by me on the 'bench/"
he urged.
"Suppose the other should 'öle' In?"
she murmured. "You shouldn't let
your arms 'compass' me."
"1 know a preacher who is a good

Moral "Risks."
It is pointed out by a modern thinker
that there is no such tiling as .a moral
risk, for when wc talk about a "risk"
we mean that there is a possibility,
but not a certainty, that harm will re
sult A boy takes a physical risk
when lie goes skating on that part of
the river where the ice is thin. He
may fall through and injure his health
or lose his life. But when we venture
on thin ice in our moral life there is no
risk In the matter at all. There is as
sured catastrophe from the moment
we start in that direction. No one can
do anything which he knows involves
possible moral danger without thereby
definitely passing beyond the line of
mere danger into positive Injury to his
character.
Three Classes.
Henry Thomas Buckle's thoughts
and conversation were always ou a
high level. Once he remarked:
"Men and women range themselves
into three classes or orders of intelli
gence. You can tell the lowest class
by their habit of always talking about
persous, the next by the fact that their
habit is always to converse about
tilings, the highest by their preference
for the discussion of Ideas."
Almost Sensational.
"I have a ripping idea for a moving
picture film."
"Let's have it. Ripping ideas are
scarce."
"Show a young woman doing the
housework while her mother is sitting
on the porch manicuring lier nails."—

Gold In the Bible.
The earliest book which mentions
gold is the Bible, in the second chap

Welsh is taught in the public schools
of Wales, is universally spoken there
and is extensively spoken in this coun
try. The language is not closely re
lated to the Irish and highland Gaelic,
but is of the same brauch as the an

What the "Von'' Means.
The German title of "von" as a prefix
before a surname was in feudal times
the privilege of the landed barons, who
thus designated, as in other countries
with like prefixes, their ownership of
lands. In modern times, however, the
prefix "von" may be granted as a titlo
of nobility by the German emperor or
the kings of the various kingdoms of
the empire. It does not carry any
privileges or emoluments with it. It
Is recorded in the heraldry office in
Berlin if granted by the emperor as
kaiser or as king of Prussia, in Munich
If granted by the king of Bavaria,
Leipzig if conferred by the king of
Saxony, etc. The recipient is not given
a diplomn with K. It may he, like the
English title of baronet, personal or
hereditary—that is, it may he grant
ed to a man for his lifetime only or
may descend to his sons. It cannot be
assumed by any one,« bfft may be earn
ed by any deserving German subject
and conferred as a reward for service
or eminence.—San Francisco Chronicle.
An Ancient Tragedy.
A historical paper in Lord Montngfi's
collection in London tells of a strange
tragedy "done in Ilolborn, a little be
fore Christmas," several centuries ago:
"A boy seven years old came up into
a gentleman's chamber and prattled to
him and drew his sword and flourished
with it The gentleman, being in lied,
wondered to see tlie boy toss his blftde
so and said: 'So, good boy, tbou hast
doue well. Put in tlie sword.' The boy
persisting, the gentleman rose and held
him the scabbard, and tlie rude hand
ed lad, thinking to sheath the sword,
lustily ciiopt it iuto Ills body. Compa
ny were called. One offered to strike
the child. 'Let him alone,' quoth the
gentleman. 'God is just This boy's
father did I kill five years since and
none knew. Now lie hath revenged it'
And the gentleman died tlie second
dressing." ,
Tricky Fox.
A gentleman while hunting near a
river one winter day saw a fox run
out on the ice and make at full speed
for an opening in the ice where the
rushing water of tlie river could be
plainly seen from the bank, says the
Scotsman. At the edge he stopped,
turned, followed his tracks back to l lie
bank and then ran some distance down
the stream and sat there. Soon a dog
came crashing out of the woods, bay
ing finely, hot on tlie fox's trail. Now,
dogs when on a chase of this kind
trust almost entirely to their noses.
This one was no exception. He ran
along the ice, head down, and when he
rcacht'd the hole lie could not stop, but
plunged into the water and disappear
ed forever. Then the fox trotted away
with every sign of satisfaction.
A Disclosure.
Little Willie was instructed by his
teacher, Mr Robinson, to write an es

Vhis was his brief essay;

Tens of thousands of fanners as well as
town and city folks cut down their store
bills one-half last year and saved money
in spite of generally short crops and re

Absolutely millions of dollars were
saved and countless families lived better

How were these burdensome store bills
cut down? By the real money-saving
power of good home gardens, rigidly
