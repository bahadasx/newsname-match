FIRE INSURANCE
IN WILLIAMSBURG.
.
ROW NEW LAW AFFECTS FIRE !
INSURANCE IN THIS SECTION
AS SHOWN BYIOCAL AGENT.
To Our Patrons:?
As many of you know already, the
Legislature of South Carolina at its
last session passedjwhat is known as
the Laney-Odom till, an anti-compact
law framed 4>r the purpose of
forcing the Southeastern Underwriters
associatiol out of the State,
thus breaking |p the Stamping
Office in Columbil, which fixed the
fire insurance ratis for all risks in
Fthe State. As a fesult of the passage
of this bill {11 the association
companies and cany of the nonassociation
coragmies have withdrawn
from Soutfc Carolina, leaving
many of the ajfents without any
companies at all.'
While we are left as destitute as the
majority of the ajrents of the State,
still we have lost fix of our best fire
insurance compares and for awhile
we had only thr4 left, as follows:
Southern Stock Fre Insurance Company,
Southern underwriters, both
of Greensboro, and the EquitIable
Fire Insurant^ Company .Charleston,
S C. Late? we succeeded in
getting the Undf^writers of Greensboro,
Greensboil, N C, and the
Southern Home, | Charleston, S C,
making in all tiv^pompanies we now
represent. The? will continue to
business in State under the
lew law, and shall be able to
place with theJ all the desirable
bitsiness we carwet. They are all
Southern eompMes, and have been
in business seve? years. They are
financially ablef.o protect all the
business in \?iamsburg county, j
and for that ref )n the people who 1
carry insuranceleed not fear that
r they cannot getAisurance.
r It is true th? the above named
companies do im write so liberally
as the Liverp<j and London and
f Globe Companj||jverpooi, tngiana;
Aetna olHartford, Conn, but
^H^Kthe insura* public will make
|HPBry effort toleduce the number
V of fires by beifl careful as to how
W they constructjheir flues and chimneys,
building lie chimneys always
of brick, and # flues built of brick
i laid flat suspeAd upon iron hangers;
and will djourage the writing
V. of insurance fo ^?eople whose morals
N^re questionah , then we shall be
ante to induce ie small companies
" that stay in tl State to write more
liberally for u There are one or
two kinds of i cs that we are still
Kflk unable to pla< in these companies,
but hope to g the agency before
^^Imany days fo companies that will
^^ Wdle these bs. If you want the
^Hg rates low, be reful with fire, and
^^^ou will do rx e toward the reduc
A^ftion of insur^e rates than all the
^HpLegislatures Anbined. Should we
not be able tffclace your insurance
we will give 1L notice time enough
^fcto get it placAelsewhere if possible.
Inasmuch as A the agents of the
State are up lainst the same prow
position, it vA be hard for you to
|j place your bifces?, if you cannot
I get it througAs, for we now repre

sent about as many companies as any ,
other agency in the State.
We wish to inform the people of j
the county that fire insurance is not i
the only lousiness carried on in our
agency. We have the largest bondj
ing business in the county, and
j write bonds of all kinds; such as j
county officials, guardians, admin-i
istrators, and other judicial bonds,,
banks, managers and other em-1
plyees of different kinds of business, {
postoffice bonds, etc. Our bonding
company is the United States Fidelity
and Guaranty Company, Baltimore,
Md, and one of the leading
companies in America.
Wo wish esDeciallv to call your at
tention to the life insurance feature
of our agency. Of the many companies
represented in the county
there is nv,ne better than the Southern
Life ana Trust Company, Greensboro,
N C. It is purely a Southern
company, having been in business
for more than thirteen years, and
having passed over the trying days
of all young insurance companies
with honors. It is under the conservative
management of Mr A W
McAlister, one of the most successful
insurance underwriters in the
United States. He has proven that
the secret of success in life insurance
underwriting is the care exercised
in making the medical examination.
A policy with this company
is a certificate of good health. It
means a low death rate, and a low
death rate means fewer claims to be
paid, fewer claims paid means more
dividends dished out to policy holder,
thus making the cost of insur- j
ance lower in this company than in i
the average company. They give1
you a. free medical examination
every year, which is equivalent to i
handing you back $5.00 every time 1
you are examined. Very few com- j
panies care enough about their
policy holders to do that.
Livestock insurance is another important
feature of our agency work.
Anything that is worth having
around you is worth protecting.
How many of you ever stood over ;
the body of a dead horse or mule |
? -J ?__i !i. !. A- 1 1 I
ana reanzea wnai it is to lose suen a <
friend in the spring, or summer?
How many of you ever had to go to
the salestable man and put up a
hard luck story in order to get an- i
other horse? You know what a!
comfort a hundred dollars would'
have been to you at such a time. |
Why not insure your stock while it;
is in good health? When it is sick
it is too late to get protection.
For information on any kind of,
insurance come to see us, write us, j
or phone No 85. We are as ever,
Yours to serve,
Kingstree Insurance, Real Estate
& Loan Co,

You occasionally see it stated that
colds do not result from cold weather.
That is rank foolishness. Were
it true colds would be as prevalent
in midsummer as in midwinter.
The microbe that causes colds flourishes
in damp, cold weather. To
get rid of a cold take Chamberlain's i
Cough Remedy. It is effectual and
is highly recommended by people
who have used it for many years as
occasson required, and know its real
value. Obtainable evevwhere,

HELD FOR MURDER.
Florence County Negro Said ti
Have Beaten Wife to Death.
Lake City, March 20:?One of th<
most brutal murders which has oc
curred within the history of Flor
ence county is charged against San
Singletary, a negro man who wa!
taken to the county jail on Saturday
by Coroner Gunn from the Lak<
City section.
On Saturday morning Coronei
Gunn was called by wire to Lakf
City to hold an inquest over tht
body of a negress, Minnie Singletary
wife of Sam Singletary, the peculiar
character of whose death had arous'
ed suspicions of foul play. The
testimony brought out the fact that
the man had been accustomed tc
beating her and that a few days
previously he had flown into a rage
and so belabored her with a piece of
leather harness that she was made
desperately ill. A doctor was summoned
by one of the chifdren and
upon examination discovered that
the woman, who was in a delicate
state of health, had sustained internal
injuries from which she could
not recover. The jury found that
she came to her death from a blow
inflicted by her husband and Coroner
Gunn immediately arrested the mar
and returned with him to Florence,
where he was placed in jail.
Child Badly Burned.
Last Thursday afternoon Leroj
Carter, the three-year-old son of Mr
and Mrs A L Carter, was seyerely
burned at the home of his grandparents,
Mr and Mrs HA Miller.
The little fellow was standing by e
stove and his clothing became ignited,
and in an instant they were in
flames. A little brother,who was the
the only one in the room with Leroy,
gave the alarm. The flame was extinguished
quickly,but the child was
severely burned about the face and
hands. We are pleased to learn that
the little fellow is getting on nicely.
Few of us believe in luck?unless
we happen to be unlucky.

UNLAWFUL FISHING.
, Game Warden Epps Going for
Offenders.
For the past few weeks our game
warden, Mr Thos W Epps, with the
assistance of Mr W W Dennis and
^ the chief game warden's assistance,
have been making regular trips - up
3 1
and down Black river clearing the
stream of unlawful fish nets and
*
traps.
, I They report many traps destroyied.
and have seized and are holding j
? i
as evidence quite a number of nets
that were set during the closed sea[
son, which is from the setting of
the sun each Thursday to the rising _
of the sun each Monday. Mr Epps
says many of these nets were stretch- 0
ed from bank to bank across the
>
(I river, which accounts for the lack of
shad in Black river in this section.
. The wardens have in their possession
captured nets ranging from ten
to thirty feet deep and from fifteen
j to two thousand eight hundred
yards long.
Already a number of prosecu-1
tions and convictions have been g
j made and there are a number of
others still to come before the Magistrate
at Georgetown, where Mr
Epps spent several days this week in
connection with the prosecution.
It is to be hoped the work of the j
game wardens in this instance will!
result in much good, as it has been
a common complaint among fisher- f
men in this community that George'
town fishermen were persistently
obstructing the passage of fish up
r the river.
