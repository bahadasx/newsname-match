One span of the Tennessee river
bridgo on the Queen & Crescent route
was wrecked last Friday night when
freight car jumped the track and seven
teen cars fell into the river. All tin
trainmen escaped injury. Traffic is be
ing dt-tourcd via Knoxville. It will be
some time before the bridge can be re

Secrecy will bo maintained by the
general staff as to the movements of
troops in pursuit of Villa. General
Funiton, who lias shown that he is
aware of the necessity for concealing
such military information. Is expected
to maintain a rigid censorship when tho
punitive expedition enters upon ita real
campaign.
Every since the momentous August
of 11114 especially during the past six
months the skyrocketing of the prices
of necessities around a newspaper plant
has gone with a beauty of consistency
which arouses absolutely no enthusiasm
among publishers thruout the country
who have to foot the bills. Products
essential to the publication of news
papers have jumped In price all tho
way from 10 or 15 to 3,000 or more per
cent.
When President Wilson ordered the
United States army to cross the Mexi
can bsrder and avendgo the death of
American citizens the nation almost to
a man spontaneously arose and put ita
entire strength and hearty support
squarely behind the president. There
was not a word of objection heard on
any aide. The patience of the Amer
ican H-ople had been sorely tested un
til it could r-isijt tit longer. "Villa dead
or Villa alive" that was the motto of
the troops who had long been on the
border.
THE STORK AGAIN
Mr. Harry Klmore is the happy
father of a handsome bady boy which
arrived at his home last Saturday
morning.
PROLIFIC SOW
Mr. W. R. Denny is tho owner of the
Ky. Red Herkshire sow, "Anna Hell",
that has produced four litters of pigs
or fifty five pigs In all, un average of
about fourteen to tho litter. Mr. Den
ny says she is north her weightingold.
SPEAKING OF BULLS.
One of tho laigest bulls we have
seen uround in these "diggins" for
some time, in fact about tlu largest
one wo have seen anywhere, was pur
chased by V. H. Rrownof J. T. An
derson last Friday that tipped tho
henni at 2100 pounds. Tho unimiil was
shipped to the Cincinnati market for
slaughter and the perton that call for
a steak from him will bo handed
"ome bull."
"BATTLE CRY OF PEACE"
Wo announced through erior last
week that the Opera House would show
The Rattle Cry Of Peace at 9 A. M. on
tho morning of the 27th of March, and
now desiro to correct it. Only two
shows, the first one begins at 1 P. M.
and the second show begins promptly
at 7:30 P. M. This will ba County
Court Day and a large crowd will see
this great picture. It consists ot nine
reels and it takes two hours and fifteen
minutes to see It. Seats now on sale
for tho night show at McRoberts Drug
Store.
MORE SHEEP KILLED.
Worthless dogs are playing havoc
with the sheep over the county and
many valuable animals have been lost
In tho past few weeks. Mr. J. R.
Rourne had his flock invaded last Friday
night and four of his finest uwej were
killed. It means quite a loss to the
fanner at this time, just when the
ewes are lambing and the prospect of
high prices for wool and lambs for
spring delivery makes the loss doubly
severe. Get out your old (hot gun
farmers and kill every dog seen on your
place unless accompanied by tho owner
Mr. Harry Ware, p.oprirtor of the
"Gem" mado an assignment to II.

climax in having just what you wnt
and at prices lower than you can get
elsewhere. The local merchants have
taken great pains in making selections
realizing tho fact that their customers
want something good ut a reasonable
price.
A visit to the stores will quickly con
vince you that you can sae money by
buying at home. Under these condi
tlons, why make an expensive trip to
other cities where you can get no bet

SHIPS FINE YOUNG STALLION
Mr. A. D. Rradshaw has recently
shipped his young stallion, Star dies
ter. No. CI70 A. S. II. R A. to Mr. V,
W. Ray who .will candle him through
out tin fair circuit this season. This

direct. He is a beautiful black with
plenty of stylo and conformation.
DIDN'T MAKE
GOOD.
The editor of a country paper in Tex
as announced ono week that he was go
ing to print in his next issue the name
and picture of the most gossipy, long-
tongued woman in the town. Rut the
editor did not make good his promise;
within an hour after the papers were
mailed all the doctors in the community
were battling frantically with twenty
sevtn cases of nervous prostrations,
whilo tvventy-even different husbands.
armed with shotguns, were lined up
outside the door of the editors office.
HEMP SEED FROM CHINA.
Mr. Dave Dudderar, a well known
farmer of this county, has received
notice or the shipment to him of two
pounds of cultivated hemp seed grown
in North China, near Tienstin. Chili
perhapi the oldest civilized country in
the world, has produced for hundreds
of years, a email quantity of fine hemp
not unlike that grown here. It will be
interesting to watch the growing of
hemp from this sample of seed sent
from the old to the new world. The
seed will be on exhibition at the office
of the local hemp dealers, Hudson,
Hughes and Farnau.
TOBACCO SEED PROFITABLE
The reputation that R. F, Kelly and
oon nave maue in tne past lew years
with their improved Rurley tobacco has
been wonderful and deservedly so for
they have produced great results. In
asking that their advertisement be
lifted, that has been running in the
Record for several weeks, they gave as
a reason that it had sold about $1,200
worth of seed and their supply was now
exhausted. They have shipped this
seed to nearly every state in the Union
where tobacco can be raised, its retail
price being $1. an ounce, which means
a total of 1200 ounces sold during the
season.

MILLINERY OPENINGS.
"Milady" was hard to please if she
did not see a Spring hat she wanted at
either Mrs. Rella Francis, Miss Minnie
Rrowns or Lyons last Saturday. The
assortment and styles of hats in each
place were very attractive, froir the
little girls hats In dainty colors to the
hats for adults. Flowers, fruit and
bright ribbons galore made theBe shops
look like veretable flower gardens.
In years gone by it was hard to get
childrens hats, this la not the case now,
neither is it hard for elderly ladies to
be .suited, to great Is the assortment ot
trimmed hats.
The millinery stores of Lancaster
were thronged with interested buyers
and spectators last Saturday from early
morn until late at night ana all pro
pounced the hats "creations" and
things of beauty.
SUNDAY BIG DAY AT
CHRISTIAN CHURCH
Mens Day A Success In Every Way.
Last Sunday was one of the greatest
days the Chnstiun church has ever C3C
perienced in the way of spiritual uplift
and real christian enjoyment.
The day was called "Men's Day",
the men having charge of morning, af.
tcrnoon nn.d evening services.. The
meeting was gotten up, primarily, for
the benefit of Prof. Caneer's Ribl
class of men, although it will redound
to great good for the whole church.
This class is making on effort to have a
larger class andchurch attendance from
the older men of the town. Some of
the leading spirits in tho class, feehmr
they would draw strength and inspira
tion from coming in contact with lead
ers in the Hible Schools of other towns,
invited representatives from Danville,
Kiohmond and Winchester to "come
over into Macedonia" and help us and
ieu us now mey secured and kept up
attendance. Although all the talks
were made by laymen they seeired "to
the manor born" in the pulpit, so earn
est and inspiring were their talks.
Prof. McDougle and B. E. Turley of
Kicbmond, Prof. Falhs of Danville,
Messrs Pendleton and Pruitt of Win
chester, all told of the work and meth
ods pursued in their churches as to
disseminating light and christian love
and the plans pursued in getting new
scholars and retaining them.
One feature of the day was the "Mens
Choir." the entire choir being composed
of men who, at least, made a joyful
noise while many pronounced it excel
lent music. The solo by Mr. Charlie
Doty was greatly enjoyed. The after
noon service, lor men only was help
ful and enjoyed by all who attended.
Altogether it was a gala day and one
long to be remembered in the Christian
church.
The following were here fr&m Dan
ville; Geo L. Walden. J. A. Robinson,
James Raughman, Prof. O. L. Fallis
and Percy Joheson; from Richmond; J
Bowman. B. E. Turley, Prof. Mc
Dougle, Elma Detherage, John Arnold
and Z. T. Bice, from Winchester,
Messrs Pendleton, Pruitt and Geo. R.
Nelson; from Stanford, Rev. D. M.
Walker, K. J. Francis, J. S. Hocker,
J. R. Foster and Dr. W. H. O'Hannun.
TO THE DEMOCRATS
OF GARRARD COUNTY.
I wish to announce that I would like
to have the ollico of County Court Clerk
for this county, und will be a candidate
for the nomination ut the August
Primary 1917, subject to the action of
the democratic party. I am not advis
ed as to the necessary steps requiredbv
law to fill the vacancy now existing in
this office at the August Primary and
November election this fall.
Rut feeling as nil good democrats
should feel, that the faithful und loyal
democracy and the excellent service of
our lamented friend, Hon. J. W.Hamil
ton should be recognized by giving to
his widow and family the opportunity
to complete the term of office to which
he was elected by the people. I will
therefore, not interfere with thtir
plans, but wish to pledge the family
my aid and help to this end.
Mv democracy and service to our
partv in the past is too well known to
necessitate any discussion at this time.
Just what the party has done for me
and what service I have rendered Is
generally known. I hope that the of.
flcia! positions with which I have been
honored by you and tho services I have
rendered in this connection has been
uch as to commend me to the considera
tion of my fellow democrats and the
people generally. If I should be suc
cessful in my ambition I promise an in-
dustrous performance of the duties of
the office I seek. If my fellow demo
crats do not think I should have this
preference, or that there is another
more meritorious, I shall be found in
the future as in the past at my post of
duty serving my party wherever and
whenever In my power.
