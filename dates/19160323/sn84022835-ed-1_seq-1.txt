Meritorious Pictures
Call For A Boquet
Not endeavoring to donate auy free
advertising, but rather believing it to
bp a matter of news, we pause to call
attention to the hlgh-olass of pictures
which have been shown at both the
Orpheum aod Tepee this week. On
Monday evening the second install
ment of that interesting serial, ""The
Broken Coin,? waN witnessed by a
capacity house at the Ornheulu. TV.
sides fells, the main attraction, a good
drama,' ft rip-roaring Comedy and" the
Animated Weekly, Which included
some very clever work by a iigbtuing
cartoonist together with the delight
ful music discoursed throughout the
entire evening by tho Orpheum Four
Piece Orchestra, were additional fea
tures which were appreciated and en
joyed by all. Manajrer Frank Cassll
is making an excellent beginning, is
endeavoring to give his patrons their
money's wortli and is justly reaping a
liberal shargc of patronage
The Great Divide was the attraction
shown at the Tepee to large crowds on
Monday afternoon and evening and
Tuesday night and while we realize it
to be a broad' statement, yet do not
hesititate in pronouncing it one of the
best pictures ever shown in this city.
It was truly scenlcally beautiful and
perfectly played and some of the scenes
of the Grand Canyons of Arizona are
oeyona description. That Manager
Warren has his heart in his work and
as a judge of the best in the motion
picture line, ranks second to none,
must be conceeded by all.
Last night at the Tepee, The Wo
man's Law, with Florence Reed in the
leading part, was shown to a large
audience. Besides being another one
of these pictures of the highest order,
last night was the first time it was
ever shown, which in Itself is sufllclent
proof that Manager Warren secures
only the latest as well as the best
obtainable. This ploturo will be
shown again tonight.

An Ideal Time For
"Pay Up Week" Plan
In many cities and towns in tho
United States they urc carrying on a
"Pay Up Week" campaign. The plan
is to set apart a certain week and dur
ing that week ovcryone is to mako an
eirort to pay all he oun of hib debts.
It works remarkably well since when
everyone pays each Iiiin soinothtng to
pay with and often ono dollar will
liquidate ten debts. The merchants
of tills city might inaugurate this Idea
soon, preferably before the automobile
isglveu away as this would moke an
additional incentive for paying up.
