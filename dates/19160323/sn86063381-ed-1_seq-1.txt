Here.
Joseph W. Bragdon, prominent
Minneapolis business man, indicted

of Winston & Ferrington, now known
as Winston, Harper & Fisher. Brag

Bemidji Brewing company here.

known to them as "Uncle Ned," the
wealthy owner of a big green auto
mobile.
He entered a plea of not guilty
and was released on $10,000 bonds.

part of certain persons for revenge,
that the entire affair was a frame
up against him and held no truth or
foundation.

%T
TO BUILD HOMES
FOR EVERY RURAL
SCHOOL TEACHER
National Lumber Manufacturers1
As-
sociation Has Unique
Plan.
BELTRAMI COUNTY HAS
HOME AT SAUM AND DIST. 57
Old School Houses Are Used for
Homes Here Many New Homes
Planned.
The biggest, most universal scheme
for social service In the history of
America, one affecting every hamlet
in the land, has been instituted by
the National Lumber Manufacturers'
association in the proposal to build
a home for every rural school teacher
in America.
Education Advanced.
The national dissociation has ta
ken up this social service work in
the belief that the education of the
nation will be immediately advanced
if teachers of the nation's young are
properly housed. The theory is that
if teachers are provided with homes,
the county districts will be able to
secure better teachers, and avoid the
constant changes by which the
schools are always in a torn-up con
dition
Minnesota First.
Minnesota is selected for one of the
first states for the general introduc
tion of this new idea of teachers'
cottages for every rural school, be
cause it has already made amazing
progress on this very line.
Beltrami Has Homes.
Beltrami county has made ad
vancement in regard to housing
teachers, according to W. B. Stewart,
county superintendent of schools. He
stated today that the consolidated
school at Saum has a home for the
principal In district. No. 57 a room
has belttf construct^fc^adjoiniirg the
school room in which the teacher
lives This district has a school
ground of 40 acres about. 13 ot which
are cleared and are under cultiva
tion. There is some talk of a teach
ers' home at Hines and other points.
St Louis, Mahnomen, Red Lake,
Carlton and Stearns counties have
made much progress in the housing
of their teachers. The buildings are
equipped in every way and no rent
is charged. Fuel is free and the
teachers live usually at a cost of
from five to ten dollars a month.
SCHOOL INSTALLS
GRAINFANNINGMILL
Machine to Be Used by Farmers of
County at High School,
Free,
A grain fanning mill has been in
stalled by the agricultural depart
ment at the Bemidji high school. The
machine is used for grading grains,
and can be used free of charge by
farmers.
The machine was bought for the
purpose of grading grains for the
state fair exhibit next fall. By use
of the mill, the small grains are sep
arated from the larger grains and the
chaff is fanned out and discharged
from the machine.
Although at present it is run by
hand, power can be attached.
Farmers living in this vicinity are
invited to use the machine whenever
necessary. This will mean a finer
quality in the exhibits shown at the
county and state fair from this sec
tion.

'JJ.j^eUR,
Dr. Darragh Can Serve As
CityPhysicianRuIesOfficer
No Reason Why He Cannot Serve if
Legally Appointed, Says
Dr. Keyes.
FIRST TO BE APPOINTED
IN STATE OF MINNESOTA
State Board of Health Officers Says
Hunch is That He Cannot
Serve.
Dr. F. J. Darragh, an osteo
path, was elected city physician
at a recent meeting of the city
council. He is the first osteo
path in the state to be appointed
to such an office and there has
been considerable discussion
whether or not he could serve in
that position. The Pioneer,
through the United Press, has
interviewed the state officials on
the matter. The outcome may
be decided by a test case. The
following is the article received
from the United Press
(By United Press)
St Paul, Minn, March 23
"There is no reason why Dr Darragh
of Bemidji cannot serve as city phys
ician if he has been legally appoint
ed there," said Dr. Leslie Keyes, of
the state board of osteopathic exam
iners today "This is, however, the
first case in the state of Minnesota.
Oregon City, Ore, has an osteopath
as a city physician In Minnesota
the attorney general has ruled that
osteopaths are licensed physicians.
That terminates the story. Dr. Dar
ragh is licensed under the state to
practice as a physician and can per
form minor surgical operations. Other
doctors in the state might start dis
cussions but we are prepared."
Has a Hunch.
"If Dr. Darragh were appointed
health flffieer it* would be perfectly
alright for him to serve although an.
osteopath, tt that office lie woufit
come under my supervision,-" said Dr.
H. Bracken, of the state board of
health. "If he has been appointed
city physician he comes undef the
supervision of Dr. Thomas McDa
vitt, state board of medical exam
iners. My hunch unofficially is that
an osteopath cannot serve as a city
physician on account of the necessity
of performing operations and other
surgical and medical duties. How
ever, lihave no authority over city
physicians."
Out of City.
Dr. McDavitt being out of the city
his secretary was not willing to dis
cuss the technical points. He stated
that osteopaths practice under the
board of which Dr. Leslie Keyes of
Minneapolis is the head.
