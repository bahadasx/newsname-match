Another Angle to It.
To understand the situation it is
necessary to know the basis of hoars
and wages now prevailing in railroad
freight Bervice. The train crews are
paid on a basis of 100 miles in ten
hours'or less. This means that if a
train runs 100 miles in ten hours, the
crew is paid the rates which the
schedule calls for. If the train runs
60 miles in ten hours, the crew is paid
for ten hours jU3t the same, and over
time at the same rate per hour until
the run is completed. On fast through
freight a train may run 150 miles in
ten hours, in which case the 'crew is
paid one and one-half day's pay for
ten hours of work.
There can, therefore, be no fair
comparison between the pay of a
locomotive engineer and a bricklayer
or a carpenter, as sometimes is tried
in arbitrating wage disputes. If a
bricklayer works four hours, he is
paid for that time, and no more. If
an engineer runs for five hours and is
tied up on a siding the next five, he
' Is paid for ton hours. Another dis
tinction is that if a bricklayer works
overtime and receives a penalty rate,
he is engaged in productive work. A
train crew may be forced to work
overtime and not be engaged in pro
ductive work, that is, work for which
the railroad receives any revenue.
The time of the crew is, of course,
given to the railroad whether the
train is running or delayed, and the
justice of paying the crew for that
ttnio is recognized. But the payment
of penalty rates for delays, for which
neither the railroad nor the crew may
be responsible raiises another question.
It at least shows that no fair compari
son can be made of wages paid to
.men in railroad service and other
ekilled mechanics who are paid on an
'' hourly basis.
"The Other Side!"
(The National DruRsist,)
There are two sides to every ques
tion, even to the question of prohibi
tion, though its' advocates do not seem
to recognize it. They are like zealots
of all kinds the world over and in ev
ery age. They have no just sense of
proportion. They see only the one
thing and only one side of that. In
deed, they refuse to acknowledge
that there is another side. , And if it
were permitted to some of 'them they
would call intb requisition' the rack,
the thumbscrew, and even the stake,
to silence opposition and to stifle free
expression of opinion on the subject
of their obsession. And the strange
thing about it is that this Bpirit of
bigotry and intolerance is more often
and more violently manifested with
regard to questions like the one under
consideration, in which religion or
morality is involved, than any other.
Now, take this question of prohibition.
Of course, it were idle, if not criminal,
to deny that great harm results from
the uso of alcoholic drinks. For the
sake of argument, let us grant that
prohibition advocates have not exag
gerated the extent of the evil. We
eay, granting all that, and more, even
then, may there not be at least a ques
tion as to whether or not prohibition
1b the only or the Lest remedy? Is it
absolutely certain that there is no
other way by which the end aimed at
may be attained assuming that end
fco be exclusively benevolent and not
tinctured at all with malevolence?
Has the preacher or the teacher lost
his influence entirely? Have their
occupations gone? Can nothing be
done by education and moral suasion
and reason and argument? In short,
is the application of force the only
recourse? And is it absolutely cer
tain tnat prohibition will prohibit?
These and many other questions, it
seems to us, might reasonably be ask
ed. But let them bo put to the aver
age prohibitionist, and it will be like
waving a red rag in the face of an in
furiated bull. He will unload upon
you a torrent of invectives. He will
impute to you all kinds of dishonor
able motives. He will accuse you of
being in league with the saloon ele
ments, or say something worse, if his
ingenuity can conjure it up. And as to
his giving fair or any other kind of
real consideration to your objections,
why, that is entirely out of the ques
tion. There are thousands of people who
are opposed the abuse of liquor but
who do oot object to its moderate use,
There are thousands of others who
are opposed altogether to iis use and
who would even favor laws for a
reasonable regulation of its manu
facture and sale. But they have not
gone crazy dn the subject,- and when
they see how violent and unreasonable
the prohibition loaders are in their
advocacy how they exaggerate and
falsify facts and how they seem to
want to ride rough-shod over every
body's rights and to persecute even
for an honest difference of opinion,
why, wtien they see all this, they be
g n to wonder if the zealots, In their
madness, do not constitute a greater
menace to society than the evil they
would extirpate. ,
It is well not to be one-sided about
' this or any other question or problem.
Anyhow, the truth will not hurt, and
it is a confession of weakness and of
Jack of faith in one's own position not
to be willing to hear the "other side."
Audi alteram partem is a maxim old
as the hills, and it is as sound now as
when it was first propounded. A
Journal with the title "The Other
Side," whose business It 1b to teach
people to look on the other side of
the prohibition question, has lately
made its appearance. It wears no
mask of philanthropy it makes no
altruistic pretentions. Its title page
shows Us origin, and its purpose is
boldly proclaimed. It is published by
the National Wholesale Liquor Deal
ers' Association, and its whole mission
is to ask the publio not to close their
ears to reason and argument, but to
be fair enough, before destroying a
great business that has long been
recognized as legitimate by state and
nation, to consider if something can
not be said on the "other side" of
this great question. Its mission, there
fore, without regard to the merits of
the question of prohibition, is a
worthy one, and in the interest of
justice and sanity it ought to have a
large circulation.
Political Notes.
If Roosevelt hadn't stolen Panama
and robbed Columbia, perhaps the
South American Republics would rally
a little more cheerfully to the leader
ship of the United States in preparing
for the defense of the Monroe Doe
trine. .
Roosevelt has sailed for a West
Indies island to shoot wild hogs. It is
too much to hope that even big suc
cess in these hog skirmishes will satis
fy his thirst for gore. On his return
declarations of war against Germany
will again issue from Oyster Bay.
The St. Louis budget system would
no doubt help the State government
a great deal in the matter of limiting
appropriations, but may the good Lord
deliver us from the St. Tjouis tax
system as it has been manipulated by
the Republican politicians of that
city.
Governor Hadley says his health
will not permit him to run for United
States Senator. But he says he isn't
too sick to run for President. Evident
ly he is of the opinion that it will take
a mighty strong, vigorous and healthy
Republican to carry Missouri this
year. .
The Globe-Democrat of March 2,
right in the middle of its first page,
says that "St. Louis reports a degree
of prosperity unknown for several
years;" that at Kansas City the rail
roads are unable to handle all the
busines that is offered them, etc. This
is too much. Some Republican spell
binder ought to answer it.
The Globe-Democrat hasn't b-u r-s-t-e-d
"busted" the State treasury for
twenty-nine days. Governor Major's
recent order holding up all over-appropriations
and declaring that ex
penses must be kept within the
revenues, appears to have chopped
the G.-D.'s deficit howl out by the
roots. The Governor's pay-as-you
go plan is popular with the people
and a mighty good business proposi
tion for the State. It took courage
to put it in force, but the Democratic
chief executive has that quality.
mere is no need, nor is it wise or
prudent, for any Democrat to permit
calamity bowlers and hungry Repnb
licans to stir up in his breast and heart
a senseless belief that the "State
crowd" have done anything that is
wrong, dishonest or inefficient. Fel
low Democrats, don't you listen to the
ravings and promises of bu ngry Re
publicans and forget yourself so far
as to go off in their camps, for if they
ever get charge of affairs, they will
sup the cream and give you nothing
not even thanks. So brace up as
man and Democrat and fight Repub
licanism as you have long fought it
as an enemy to everything that De
mocracy stands for.-,

Build Silver Mine Road.
(Frederiektown Democrat-News.)
To The Democrat-News:
I want to ask you for a little space
in your paper te talk a little about the
road to the Silver Mines and the
building of a road across the river
there. I want to say the time is here
for something to be done and if it is
not done, and that pretty soon, I am
afraid Frederiektown is going to lose
the benefits that the trade of that
place will be to us here.
Now from what I can hear, (not
see) Ironton and Arcadia and the
citizens between the mines and the
towns have up a subscription list and
there is almost enough money pledg
ed to build a good road from the
mines to Arcadia. Now this is not
right, the mines are in this county
and that trade belongs to Frederick
town and we can get it if we will go
after it.
We must take some action at .once.,
Now this is what it will take to get it
a good road' to the mines and bridge
across the river and both can be done
if we will all get together after it. It
will not cost us any. more to build the
road and bridge both than it will Iron-
ton to build the road as we have the
best route to build it over and the
material is right along where the road
will run. Nature has already built the
abutments for the bridge as all who
have been there will know. There is
a solid granite bluff on each side of
the river at the dam and" there is a
solid rock in the center of the river
on which to build the center pier and
the cost would be the bridge and put
ting it up. By putting the road up
there the route of the present road
could be changed for about one and
one half miles this side of the river
and get rid of three of the worst hills
between here and the river and the
new road would be a gravel ridge
which would be easily made and
would be at least one half mile short
er than the present route to the river.
The bridge at the dam would almost
get rid of the grades on each side of
the river.
This would also be a great thing for
this town in another way as it would
give ua a fine automobile road
through to Ironton, as they are sure
to build their end of the road whether
we do or not and the people of this
town and community can not over
look this as it means too much for the
business of this' town. Now, Commer
cial Club, here is another proposition
for you to get busy on. Now the
point is this, let's everybody get busy
and make this go. Every business
house in this town should subscribe
frpm $100 to $500 to help this along as
it will all come back to them.
Respectfully,
Felix J. Parkin.
