CLOSE OX VILLA S THAIL.
IJelieved lT. S. Troops Will Soon Capture
Mexican Outlaws.
Washington, March 21.?General
Pershing, leading the American expeditionary
forces in Mexico, reported
to the war department today that
he had reached a point near Villa
and his outlaws. It was nade clear
i v. +V./-V tViof Oon Porch in cr
All 111C UlOpdltll 'lllU t x \_/X kJ'LlAXAQ
believed the troops of the de facto
government were cooperating in the
bandit hunt and that it is quite possible
Villa may be trapped.
Officials continued to assert today
that all dispatches to the war and
State departments told of cooperation
between the American and Carranza
forces, and of generally favorable
conditions in the interior ovf
Mexico, and along the border. Unofficial
dispatches picturing a very
different situation were brought to
the attention of Secretary Baker, who
said that while the situation was
fraught with many possibilities, so
far there had been no unfavorable
developments. One of Gen. Pershing's
reports tonight said the attitude
of the natives continued friendly. Mr.
Baker, in referring to this, explained
that the department had no information
to indicate that a single hostile
shot had been fired against or by the
American troops since they entered
Mexico.
While Acting Secretary Polk, of
the State department, and Eliseo Arredondo,
Mexican ambassador designate,
were conferring during the day
over the terms of the protocol proposed
by Gen. Carranza to govern the
joint pursuit of Villa, the war department
was ordering additional
troops to/the border in response to a

cavalry, the squadrons of which are
stationed at Fort Myer, Va., Fort
Sheridan, 111., and Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas, and the 24th infantry at
Fort D. A. Russell, Wyoming, were
ordered to entrain immediately. The
point to which the troops will move
was not disclosed.

ing of the convention. The selection

many important subjects were given
consideration.
Much good was obtained from the

46 INJURED, 2 MAY DIE.
Students Jump From Second Story.
Big Orangeburg Fire.
Orangeburg, March 20.?Forty-six
students and teachers were injured
at an early hour this morning, when
the administration building, the
greater part of which was used as a
girls' dormitory, of the State Colored
college, was totally destroyed by fire.
Several are considered in a very serious
condition, and it is feared that
two are fatally injured.
It seems that the fire, the origin
of which is not known, had gained
considerable headway before discovery,
making it rather difficult for the
A ^ ' -3
occupants, about sou, to escape, ana
in the excitement many jumped from
the second story. Only a very small
part of the contents was saved and
the majority of the students lost
their clothes.
Everything possible is being done
for the relief of the injured ones and
the care of the others. Eight physicians
were pressed into service this
morning and they were kept busy several
hours attending the injured. A
part of the president's house was
made into an improvised hospital and
the relief work was carried on with
as .much dispatch as possible.
Some of the students were given
temporary quarters in a dormitory at
Claflin University, which adjoins the
State college, while temporary accommodations
were secured elsewhere for
most of the others. President Wilkinson
states that arrangements will
be made to provide for the students,

more than necessary, some win uej
allowed to go home long enough to

The building, which was a large

were valued at approximately
$60,000. About half of this is covered
by insurance.

MAY MISS DEATH.
Vaughn Will Be TransfeiTed to Asylum
for Sanity Test.
Spartanburg, .March 19.?Thurston
U. Vaughn, who is in the State penitentiary
under death sentence for
heinous crimes which he confessed to
have committed while he was superintendent
of the South Carolina Odd
Fellows Orphanage here, is to be incarcerated
in the State Hospital for
the Insane. Solicitor P. A. Bonham
stated today that he will apply next
week for an order from the circuit
court to transfer Vaughn. A test of
, Vaughn's sanity will be made while
he is in the State hospital.
If the tests show Vaughn to be insane
he will escape the death penalty.
Vaughn was convicted on October
26th, 1912, and was sentenced to be
electrocuted. His attorneys have appealed
his case to the supreme court
and to the United States supreme
court, which tribunals sustained the
judgment of the circuit court. A decree
of insanity is the only thing that
can now save Vaughn from the chair.
Solicitor Bonham decided to take
the step to have Vaughn placed in
the hospital, after correspondence
with Governor Manning and Dr. J.
Heyward Gibbs, of Columbia.

here. He died almost instantly. Details
of the tragedy were unavailable

man walked into his office and it is
said without'a moment's warning
shot him to death.
Funeral services were held this afternoon
and the burial conducted
there. Mr. Hardee went to Cleveland
from here 12 years ago to begin the
practice of law. In the short time
that he was there he accumulated
considerable wealth. He took an active
interest in the politics of Cleveland,
being mayor for three terms.
He was born at Lowryville, Chester
county, but early moved to. Chester
with his parents. As at Cleveland,
his young manhood in Chester was
characterized by industry and aspiration
after high purposes in life.

GKTTIXG NAVY IX TRIM.
_ ^
Hear Admiral Benson Tells of Preparations
Being Made.
Washington, March 16.?Rear Admiral
Benson, chief of naval operations,
today told the house naval
committee in minute detail of the
preliminary work of preparing the
navy for an emergency.
The naval militia, he said, is beinc
hrnnaVif /tAnctontlv intn nlncor
iilQ UUftiiW VVUOLU11 11 J 111 tU VlUO^l
touch with navy ideas, merchant vessels
are under inspection to determine
what private craft would be immediately
available in case of war, and
each naval bureau is informed exactly
as to what it would have to do
wvith these vessels.
The navy is working, Admiral Benson
testified, on mobilization, organi- N /1
zation, strategic and supply plans for
quick action should it become necessary
to strike promptly.
Admirai Benson sounded a warning
against adopting the submarine
ideas of the present war.
"We have learned something from
the European war," he said, "but we
should not be led astray by the conditions
under which the submarine
warfare abroad is being carried on."
Aviation Development.
Aviation development, he said, was
progressing slowly and conservatively.
Sixteen aircraft are in commission
at Pensacola. Twenty-five more
are ordered, and twenty-five extra
motors. Reports from Pensacola
were most encouraging in results and
enthusiasm of personnel.
Admiral Benson assumed the responsibility
for cutting the aviation
estimate to $2,000,000, for which
there has been considerable criticism
of Secretary Daniels in the congressional
hearings. "There has been a
temptation," said the admiral, "to go
into different fields of experiment and
that is one reason why a larger appropriation
than the $2,000,000 we
have asked for next year is not recommended."
Admiral Benson said he had listed
2,031 merchant ships, power boats
and other auxiliary craft, which
might be pressed into service in the.
event of war. He recommended enlargement.
of the navy personnel by
12,000 next year, and said he
thought about 8,000 men could be
raised in event of war from the naval
reserve and naval militia, and about
16,000 from the ranks of those who
previously had served.
Use of Aeroplanes.
In his discussion of aeroplanes the
admiral suggested that their use by
the navy should be cpnfined chiefly to
scouting duty until a higher degree
of perfection has been reached in
their construction. He declared there
was no doubt the navy could get
aeroplanes as fast as it needed them
in time of emergency. He said that
in event of war the country should
start off with one hundred service
machines, increasing the number as
. -
developments warranted. s
Questioned about the detailed or- ...
ganization of the navy, Admiral Benson
said he was inclined to favor a
general staff organization that would
avoid a duplication of official machinery,
although under the present
arrangement the operations office was
working entirely satisfactorily.
"The secretary is always there, anxious
to keep in touch with everything
that is going on," he added.
"With the backing Secretary uanieis
always has given me, there's nothing
left to be desired." J
FAIRFIELD TRAGEDY CASE.
Likely to Be Called at April Term at
York.
York, March 17.?The April term
of the court of general sessions for
York county, which convenes April
17, with Judge I. W. Bowman presiding,
will dispose of a number of cases
of more or less interest throughout ?
the State, in addition to several of
particular interest to York county. It
is expected that the cases against Ernest
Isenhower, Jim Rawls and Jesse
Morrison, of Fairfield county, charged
with the killing of Sheriff Adam
D. Hood, of Fairfield county, and his
negro prisoner, Jules Smith, on the
steps of the Fairfield county court
house at Winnsboro early last year,
will be called.
It will be remembered that Ernest
Isenhower was acquitted at the November,
1915, term of court of general
sessions for York county of the
charge of killing Deputy Sheriff
Raleigh Boulware in the Winnsboro
tragedy. Following the verdict dn
the Isenhower-Boulware case, counsel
for the defence and prosecution
agreed that the cases against Isenhower,
Morrison and Rawls for the
killing of Sheriff Hood and Smith be
- - - * f* ii
continued until the third weeK or me
April term.
