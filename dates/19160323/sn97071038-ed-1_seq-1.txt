H. H. flliSHEIlD
At ft recent meeting of the school
hoard ol District No. 1, H. H. Hoff
man was by the unanimous vote of
that body elected to serve for- an
other year In his present position as
superintendent of the Heppner
schools.
In taking this action the board
fwels that they could do no better
During the superintendency of Prof,
Hoffman, the local school has made
a remarkable development and
through the tireless work of the man
at the helm the local high school has
been standardized, thereby gaining
the reputation of being the tirst Stan
dnrd high school in the county as
well as taking rank with the best
high schools of the state. Another
feature of the school's development
since t he administration or rroi
Hoffman is the big Increase In the
number of pupils enrolled. We are
nf our school and should
thank the school board for the effi
cient manner In which they are di
recting its course of progress.
COUNTY SCHOOL NOTES
By Supt. S. E. Notson.
Prof. H. C. Seymour, State Agent
for the Industrial Club work, has no
tified me that the enrollment for the
club work must be complete by April
15. Now, If any teacher who has not
received the project sheets and en
rollment blanks, or If any pupil who
has not enrolled in the project work,
will let me know I will have the prop
er blanks sent to them. If they pre
fer, they may write direct to Mr.
Seymour, at Corvallis. Only those
who are enrolled In the project work
may compete for the project prizes.
Farmer C. L. Smith, of the O-W.
R. & N. Co., will furnish seed corn
tor whatever amount of land club
members may desire to plant If they
will send me their names and the
amount of land to be planted and
agree to keep a record of all work
done as per the rules of the club
work. Those who have enrolled or
Intend to enroll in the corn club work
should send In this Information at
once.
In District No. 2, Miss Minnie Dav
enport Is the teacher. The enroll
ment Is 13. The pupils are doing
good work. There is talk of building
a new schoolhouse this summer. This
would, no doubt, be appreciated by
the pupils and teacher.
In District No. 24 the enrollment
is 13. Mrs. Jessie Kelly Is still at
the helm. New deBks will be pur
chased soon. A closed water jar has
been ordered. A new encyclopedia
has been added to the library. The
writer was present at the opening of
school In the afternoon, and the pu
plls did some enthusiastic singing.
The school in District No. 48 has
been under the direction of LeRoy
Jones. This school has an enroll
ment of six all boys. New adjust
able desks have been provided for
the pupils. The school has been held
In a residence, but a schoolhouse will
be built In the spring. I noted that
a can of water is kept on the stove to
furnlHh moisture for the atmosphere.
This is done in Diatrict No. 24 also.
Let me again call attention to the
danger of pupils coming in from play
on these warm spring days and sit
ting down in a direct draft. The
pupil had better suffer a little dis
comfort for a little while than to run
the risk of taking a severe cold. A
pupil with a bad cold can not do' the
best work. Health is of prime im
portance. I note, also, that there is
a strong temptation to raise the win
dow shades and let in the sunshine.
Sunshine is a good thing in its place,
but no pupil should be permitted to
study with the sunlight falling upon
his book or near enough to annoy the
eyes. ,,
Forest Notes.
Oregon consumes annually over
2,200,000 cords of fuel wood, which,
reduced to board feet, amounts to
over 1,105,000,000 feet.
Oregon produces annually approx
imately 1,610,000,000 board feet of
logs, but consumes over two billion,
or 27 in excess of her log pro
duction. She draws heavily on
Washington for this excess.
Oregon produces approximately 3
and 1-3 million linear feet, but con
sumes only about one-half a million
feet.
The railroads of Oregon consume
over 18,000 hewn ties and the mines
22,000. Oregon also consumes 66,
000 linear feet of round mine mate
rial. Oregon produces over two billion
feet of lumber, .approximately 160
million lath, and 275 million shin
gles. Of this quantity, she consumes
nearly 23 million lath and over 116
million shingles. Of the amount ol
lumber produced, Oregon consumes
19,8 or 411 million board feet, ov
er half of which is used for building
purposes. Nearly half of the build
Ing material, of the lath and of the
shingles, is used in Multnomah and
Clackamas counties.

IT'S A LONG, L
Seed Shipped From Heppner to
MGiuimcnt Tours Eastern Ore
gon Enroute.
Its a long way to Monument, our
sister village in Grant county, some
fifty miles In the interior, but in real
ity it is even a greater distance than
that. You see, we have no direct
mall route between th3 city and
Monument, 'hence shipments must
naturally take the only route avail
able, that is by railroad to Baker and
on to John Day oh the Sumpter Val-
lev Hue and thence by stage to Mon
ument. The Heppner Milling Company this
week sent to Emmet Cochran by par
cel post, some 1250 pounds of seed.
The total postage was $27. The seed
for the most part consisted of al
falfa and vetch. There has been some
little noise made n Heppner the last
few months for the re-establishment
of the mall route between this city
and Monument but so far it seems
that the postoffice department in
Washington is unable to do anything
about the matter. In the meantime
we shall have to continue to make
the circuit of the eastern part of the
state so far as getting mail to and
from Monument is concerned.
Students Are Weighing the Earth.
Whitman College, Walla Walla,
Wash., March 21. Physics students
at Whitman college under the direc
tion of Professor B. H. Brown, head
of the department, are this week en
gaged in the task of weighing the
earth. The experiment is being per
formed with the aid of a new weigh
ing machine recently Installed In the
science building.
Althouch the new machine is a
large one and weights used in con
nection with It measure 2000 pounds
apiece, the instrument is so finely
balanced that for accurate results no
one is allowed to walk in even re
mote parts of the , science building
while experiments are being perform
ed. For this reason the earth Is be
ing weighed at night, the doors being
locked and no one beln,g allowed in
the building exoept the students per
forming the experiment and their In
structor.
House Votes Down Plan for Large
Standing Army.
A rising vote of 153 to 82, the
house defeated Kohn's amendment
to the Hay bill for a larger army.
The amendment increased the regu
lar forces to 220,000. The vote was
considered overwhelming evidence
of congressional opposition to a large
standing army.
The senate planned to pass Cham
berlaln's measure doubling the num
ber of West Point cadets selected
from army privates. Tomorrow the
senate will consider Tillman's armor
plate bill. The debate on naval pre
paredness and governmental manu
facture of munitions Is expected to
begin soon. "

CARED FOR, PAY
Six-Year-Old Gene Handsaker
Clears $10 on Four Leghorns
In Less Than Two Years.
.That it pays to keep good hens
and give them good care and atten
tion Is Bhown by the results produced
by Gene Handsaker, the six-year-old
poultry raiser, and son of Mr. and
Mrs. T, S. Handsaker. Gene's flock
consisted originally of( four little
chlcka, presented to him by a friend
in Walla Walla. Later he traded
one i;,.-. the chickens a rooster, for
another hen. To encourage his son
in thrift and industry, Mr. Handsak
er kept a record of the cost of raising
the chickens. Later when the hens
commenced laying, a record of their
production was kept as well as the
returns from the sale of eggs. From
September, 1914 to March, 1916, the
little flock produced, over and above
their cost of keep, $4.0-0. Upon leav
ing Heppner Gene sold his layers for
$6.00, thereby netting a profit of ten
dollars on four hens in less than two
years. A little care and attention did
it. The hens are of the white leg
horn strain.
