WILSON RESENTS
' PEACE STORIES
White House and State Department
Deny Report Germany Has Inti
mated Desire for Mediation.
NO BASIS FOR INTERFERENCE
WASHINGTON, March 22. Presi
dent Wilson was represented at the
White House today as being resent
ful of publication of stories that
Ambassador Gerard had reported
Germany was about to make a move
for peace. The published reports
were characterized as being based
on Inferences. The statement was
issued:
"President Wilson, through Secre
tary Tumulty, today authorized ' a
denial of stories appearing In papers
to the effort that the purpose of Am
bassador Gerard's remaining in Ber
lin was to await Germany'! proposal;
for peace. There la no Justification:
for that Inference being drawn."
Testerday the State department took
notice of the publications by denying that
Germany had intimated te the United
States that the time was ripe for the
United States, aa the largest neutral, to
renew its friendly of floes for peace, or
that the United States had been informed
that Mr. Gerard had been requested to
postpone his vacation because 'of pending
peace negotiations.
Unofficial reports reaching here today
said the ambaaaador actually had post
poned his vacation, but gave no reason.
' State Department's Statement.
The State department today again took
cognizance of the report and the follow
ing statement was lsued:
"Any statement that the German gov
ernment had Intimated that it desired
this government to tct as mediator in
neace negotlatlona or had In any way
suggested, formally or informally that
this government should take the matter
up with other powers Is absolutely with
out foundation, and the State department
has no Information that Germany Is pre
paring to make a definite move In the
direction of peace."
State department officials declared they
were resentful at the publication of the
reports because, they said, if there were
any prospects of mediation It would be
damaged. If not destroyed.
It Is known that the American am
bassadors in all the belligerent countries
have constantly been reporting on con
fidential conference for the Information
of President Wilson, and It Is understood
the burden of their reports has been that
there were no more prospects for peace
now than there have been at any time In
the last six months.
All the belligerents are understood to
be ready for peace on their own terms.

Funston Thinks that
Pershing May Have
Met Forces of Foe
BAN ANTONIO, , Tex.. March , -Although
It was sixty hours at noon today
since General Pershing filed ' hi last
message regarding the disposition of cav
alry south of Casss Grande. General
Funston professed no anxiety as to the
welfare of any ot the troops.
The exact whereabout of General
Pershing' was unknown "at headquarters
here. It was considered probable he was -out
with' one of three detachment, away
from his wireless and In no position to
report. r ,
Whether the Carransa troop succeeded
In holding Villa near Namaqulpa, or
whether the detachment of American
cavalry that was riding toward that
point encountered him, were not known,
but General Funston believed it not un
likely that by this time the Americans
and Villa's men had met. Villa -wag re
ported to have had a superior force, but
General Funaton proteased confidence
that the smaller force of American would
be able to more than hold 1U own.
The moat, evident worry, of General
Funston was caused by. the new that
two of hi aviators. Lieutenant Oorrell
and Willis, are missing. He was deeply
concerned to learn their fate, ....
Of the two regiment now on their
way to the border, all but one battalion
will be sent into Mexico, Increasing Gen

One battalion of h Twenty-fourth

Repeated failure of the wireless sets
