(Copyright, 1310. by W. O. Chapman.)
"Miss Flora Johnson, 28 Walden
avenue,” read the line In the city di
rectory, indicating that the owner of
the name was a business woman,
which, in her small way, she indeed
was.
The little clientele savored of com
mercial establishment ar* independ
ence, but in reality it covered the
drama of grim and sorre.vfu! experi
ence. At the )tf d Flora
Johnson lived in two poor rooms with
her mother, an Invalid, her father
dead and memories of a Ufa of com
fort and contentment before Mr. John
son had failed in Vos'-ess.
The old friends m ivir. lohnson al
lowed his daughter to refer to them,
but none of them nffcrr-i a position
She struggled thr ■ i ,e initiation as
a typist and stem ro.' er and secured
a good position, but the house em
ploying her went out of bn hness. She
had to lake a pom-er piece, and then
misfortune seeinec. to pursue her. Her
wages became smaller and smaller,
one of her employers aband mod bis
office, a whole month's salary in ar
rears, and at last Flora was forced to
take up rapid-fire envelope address
ing at a mere pittance. Her ward
robe was becoming shabby, but she
had no means of replenishing it. She
was, indeed, dejected at times, always,
however, seeing that her mother was
provided for. Flora went hungry
more than once at the mandates of a
sordid necessity.
The heart of the mother was
cheered, as just after six o'clock had
struck, she heard the quick step of
her daughter coming up the stairs.
.m m' :
IIP
Told Flora How Badly She Had
Needed the Position.
She fancied that she caught the echo
of a glad, joyful laugh. All excite
ment, her usually pale cheeks red as
a rose. Flora burst Into the room,
gayly waving a letter.
"Oh, mother!” she cried; "what do
.you think? My luck has changed at
last. I Just got this letter in the hall
mail box. It's for me and it's from a
firm called Andre Fairfax & Co. I
must have answered some advertise
ment of theirs for a stenographer, for
they say that 1 can report at ten to
morrow morning, that my application
is accepted and that the salary is—
oh, mother, dear, guess! guess!" flut
tered Flora breathlessly.
"Surely not $50?”
“N0—175!”
What a babbling and almost hys
terical delight there was all through
their frugal meal! What hopes they
built on this sudden and unexpected,
fortune. Flora sat up until midnight
mending gloves, doing up her hair,
starching and Ironing her best waist.
"You pretty picture!” enthused the
fond mother, as Flora kissed her
good-by. “I’ve put a poor lunch in your
handbag, but It was all there Is un
til—"
“My first week’s great, grand sal
ary!’’ cried Flora, with shining eyes.
"Then—oh, then, won’t wo luxuriate!”
Flora reached the office of Fairfax
* Co. She told her business to the
information clerk, who went into a
private office, and, returning, stated
that Mr. Fairfax wished to see her.
Flora was impressed with the kindly
face of the young man, who, it seemed,
was the head of the business. Ho
nodded intelligently as he read the
letter and wrote a line on a card.
"Take that to Mr. Doane, the office
manager," he, said. "He will assign
you to your work at onco. I hope
you will like your tasks here. Your
references were excellent."
"My references?” repeated Flora, In
a puzzled way. “Why, sir,, I sent
none —but I have them with me.”
“That is strange,” observed Mr,
Fairfax, and he reached over and
lifted a large envelope from a little
tray. “I thought I was right. Yes,
here they are.”
In wonder, and then in sickening
despair. Flora glanced over the recom
mendation of Miss Flora Johnson, but
another Miss Johnson, at entirely dif
ferent address. She felt faint as the
truth dawned upon her: Whoever had
■eat the letter had looked at the di-
rectory and had addressed the letter
to the wrong Flora Johnson.
There were tears In her eyes as she
faltered out an explanation. Blindly
she tottered from the room, reached
Min outer office and then all became
blank.
"Poor little soul!" wore the words
that greeted her as she opened her
eyes, and two typist girls were bend
ing over her as she lay on a settee
In one of the inner rooms of the suite.
"Mr. Fairfax is quite interested It
seems tills girl had her hopes raised
by receiving a letter intended for an
other of her name. That poor lunch
In her handbag! Isn't it a pity? Prob
ably her heart was set on tills posi
tion."
"Mr. Fairfax wished to know when
she recovered," spoke the other girl,
and Flora, sitting up a minute later,
was confronted by the young busi
ness man.
“You seem to have come first, ’ he
said, an expression of real Interest
and sympathy on his face, "your
namesake has not reported, so I think
we may take you on —’
“Oh, no, sir!" spoke Flora impetu
ously. "It was this other Miss lohn
son who qualified for the position.
Perhaps she. too, is depending upon
it to —to relieve —to pay her way! 1
could not think of causing her disap
pointment,” and Flora arose and left
the room.
“The hravc, unselfish girl!” spoke
Mr. Fairfax In tones of profound ad
miration “We have her address and
1 will look into this.”
He could not get rid of a memory
of that silent, pleading fare all that
day. He was eager, glad, as one of
his clerks, sent to investigate at the
address they had, returned and re
ported the circumstances surround
ing the Johnsons.
"What did you learn?" asked Mr.
Fairfax of his envoy, and his sympa
thetic face was tense and concentrat
ed as he heard the sorrowful story of
the struggling girl.
But a new life opened for Flora
within the next few days. A lettei
came from a large brokerage firm,
stating that her address as an expert
stenographer had been furnished
them and asking her to call.
Flora found herself In the position
of her life. Her companion workers
were charming, her employers con
siderate and liberal. \\ ithin a week
all of the bloom had come hack into
Flora's face and renewed courage was
restored to her tried but intrepid
soul.
One noon, as she sat down at a table
In the restaurant where she ate her
lunch, a pale-faced, frail-looking young
woman abruptly took the seat oppo
isfo her.
She Introduced herself as Mias Flora
Johnson She was the young lady
whose place with Fairfax & Co. Flora
might have had. In fervid, broken
tones she told Flora how badly she
had needed the position. Now she
thanked her for the sacrifice she had
made in her behalf.
"And Mr, Fairfax said that it was
the noblest act he had ever known.
That was why he got you your place
hero —"
The cat was out of the bag! Flora
flushed with pleasure and gratitude
at the kindly interest of the good
hearted young business man. She
wrote him a brief note that evening
thanking him for his kindness.
And wonder of wonders! He called
upon her a week later, and then the
week after that.
His interest and sympathy were
fast growing into love, and one eve
ning he confessed it. And the humble
stenographer became the happy wife
of a man of wealth.
Women More Religious Than Men.
The real reason why women are
more religious than men today is be
cause they are more human than men.
It is not by nature that they are so.
Social conditions have made them so.
As we have divided the labor of the
world between the sexes, the work of
men almost entirely concerned with
the production and distribution of
things; the work of women almost en
tirely with the production and sus
tenance 3f persons. We all of us at
times notice the groat throngs of men
who go, at the call of the whistle, in
and out of our great factories. To the
average man’s mind, these hundreds
of men are ‘‘nands,” and the purpose
of the factories where they are em
ployed is to produce "goods;' but to
the average woman's mind, these hun
dreds of laborers are human beings,
and the purpose of the factories is to
furnish sustenance, through pay en
velopes, to men and women and boys
and girls and babies yet unborn. In
most of our homes the man leaves hu
man interests early in the morning,
devotes the best hours of his day to
the welfare of things, and returns to
persons again only for the evening a
relaxation. His wife, meanwhile, has
hardly done an act of labor all the
day, has hardly made a plan or had a
thought, which Is not with consider
able intimacy related to human be
ings—her husband, her children, her
neighbors.—Barnard I. Bell, in the At
lantic.
Would Obey Orders.
The foreman swore at Cassidy for
jot fully loading up his hod. The hod,
ho said, would hold so many bricks,
and Cassidy must take a full load up
the ladder every trip.
One morning the supply of bricks
ran out and Cassidy, after gathering
every brick in sight, found he was
still short of the proper number. He
yelled up to a workman on the fifth
story.
"What do you want?" asked the
workman.
"Throw,, mo down wan brick,” shout
ed Cassidy, “to make good me load.”
r
A Sermon
for Quiet People
By REV. L. W. GOSNELL
Superintendent of Men, Moody Bible
Inst.lute of Chicago,
TEXT— The Ood of Isaac.—Exod. 3:0.
Speaking of the story of Isaac, found
In the Old Testament, Mark Guy
■ Hearse says:
. “Turning from the
story ot Abraham,
% with its stirring
fra* \ scenes and splen
| did triumphs, to
I the uneventful rec
k ord of Isaac, is as
MBk., .. when on a breezy
■ day I have stood
: on the cliff and
f watched the
the birds have
sSSiscreamed and
wheeled about the crags, and far
out at sea the ships have left their
traces in foam —then turning inland,
1 have gone down the hillside into the
still valley, sheltered from the winds,
and there the lonely plowman drove
the team across the heavy clods. All
Is still —dull, if you please to call it
so —that is Isaac.” As another has
put it, "the salient feature of his life
is that it has no salient features.’’ He
is a type of the commonplace people
of whom God has made so many. How
thrilling it is to know that God is the
God of Isaac and of all like unto
him!
Isaac’s life was no doubt a disap
pointment to men. He came by
miraculous birth, yet proved to be Just
an ordinary man. Many have hoped
to be the happy fathers ot artists,
sculptors, musicians and scholars, but
their children have turned out to be
house painters, stone masons, and dry
goods clerks. Still, it is well to have
entertained these hopes, for if our
children are no more remarkable than
they are. in spite of our ambitions,
w’hat might they have been if we had
had no ambitions for them.
Isaac’s life was directed by God.
This appears especially in the story
of his marriage, found in Gen. 24,
“The steps of a good man are ordered
of the Lord.” no matter how dull and
brown his life may he outwardly; an
"ordinary” life may still he an “or
dered" life. Horace Bushnell, in his
gr°at sermon on “Every Man’s Life
a Plan of God,” states his theme thus;
“That God has a definite plan for
every human person, gilding him
visibly or invisibly for some exact
tiling, which it will he the true sig
nificance and glory of his life to have
accomplished.”
In character Isaac was marked by
the passive virtues. We do not ap
preciate patience, gentleness, meek
ness, and other quiet graces as much
us we should.
Submission was a marked element
In his make-up. When Abraham would
offer him as a sacrifice on Mount Mo
riah he made no resistance, though
the knife actually flashed over him.
What a picture he was of our Iwird
In his submission (Heb. 10:5-7). This
element appears again in Isaac’s life
at Gerar. As fast as he would dig
wells at this place the Philistines
would contend for them, but instead
of quarreling. Isaac would move on
and dig another well. The outcome
of his meekness was that the Phil la
tinos came to him to make a cov
enant, saying, “We saw certainly that
the Lord was with thee.” Even now
there is a sense in which the meek
inherit the earth.
This quiet man was thoughtful, and
we see him going out to meditate In
♦he fields at, the eventide (Gen. 24:63).
Quiet people may know things better
than others and know them more
deeply. This twentieth century, “with
bloodshot eye and fevered pulse,” has
lost the art of meditation, but only
when truth saturates us does it really
become a life power.
Isaac was affectionate, as manifest
ed In his relation to his mother and
his wife (Gon. 24:67). We need such
people in the world. We have often
noticed that a plain mother, who has
a great heart, will he adored by a son
who shines in the world of science or
letters.
How suprising it is to find that this
quiet man was, nevertheless, sensu
ous. "Isaac loved Esau because he
did eat of his venison" (Gen. 25:28;
27:24). We have, in this matter, a
suggestion of one danger of the quiet
life. Alexander Wright says the great
est glutton he ever knew never
crossed his own doorstep and his only
walk was between his desk and the
dining table. Temperance, or. As the
Revised Version renders, self-control,
is a grace much insisted on in the
New Testament.
Isaac’s commonplace life Is notable
because linked with Christ. He was
an ancestor of Christ and also a type
of him in that his birth was super
natural and that, “in a figure,” he was
offered up and also raised from the
dead. Our lives may be made signifi
cant, in that they, too. may be linked
with Christ. Paul exhorts that even
slaves shall do their work, not as unto
(heir earthly masters, but as unto the
Lord, "for,” says he, "ye serve the
Lord Christ.’’ Our commonest actions
can be done with the same motive as
our highest deeds —"to be well pleas
ing unto him.” "The world passeth
away and the lust thereof; but he that
doeth the will of God abldeth forever.”

NEW LIFE FOR EGYPT
COUNTRY BECOMING A GRANARY
FOR THE NATIONS.
Skillful Work of Irrigating Engineers
Has Done Wonder* for Land That
Has Long Been Looked Upon
a* a Desert Waste.
From a forbidding, nun-glazed, pov
erty-sordid wasteland, farmed where
naturally fertile barely for a frugal
dally fare, Into a land of numerous
farms and plantations, of ever-extend
ing Irrigation nets and Increasing pro
fusions of green and gold and russet
vegetation, Is the story of Egypt’s
progress under European leadership
during the past generation. Where
the fame of Egypt of old was for thug
gery and revolution, the modern land
was earning renown as a wonderful
winter playgrounds for tourists and as
England’s kitchen garden, says a
statement given out by the National
Geographic society at Washington,
which discusses the Nile-land as the
granary, vegetable garden, orchard
and poultry yard to the great con
gested centers to the Northwest.
The long, fruitful farm that follows
the Nile banks through hundreds of
miles of desert, and spreads out over
the wide delta today, with the people
of the most productive countries In
the world In trenches and In training
camps, has come Into first rank Im
portance as a source of foodstuffs.
For the past 30 years the progress of
Nile control and of great irrigation
projects has been preparing the coun
try for strong competition In all of the
larger produce markets of Europe.
The number of farm holdings has
grown to about 1,000,000 In a land
with a population of 11,000,000. These
holdings Include 5,000,000 acres of
land.
And there Is labor a-plenty In the
country for the development of every
square rod of area reclaimed; for
Egypt Is one of the most densely set
tled lands in the world. Its habitable
area is given as 12,026 square miles,
and its density of population at 930
persona per square mile. Belgium, be
fore the war the most thickly settled
country In Europe, had a density of
539 per square mile. The enormous
growth In agricultural resources has
stimulated In Egypt an Increase of
population equaled by few other lands
In Old World areas besides Germany.
Cities, villages, roads, railways and
canals have sprung up out of the
profits of the Nile bonanza farm.
At the time the war broke out Irri
gation projects were In prospect that
would have reclaimed nearly 2,000,000
acres more of land. The cost of all
of these works had been estimated at
something more than $100,000,000. Cot
ton was first of the plantation crops,
with an apparently glowing future be*
fore It. Rice was the principal grain
export, being sold abroad to a value of
about $1,250,000. Fresh eggs on the
London breakfast tables were largely
Egyptians, the value of this product
taken each year by Great Britain av*
eraglng around $600,000. There wer*
also important quantities of fancy
Egyptian vegetables sold In London
markets, and a thriving cane-sugar In
dustry was In the course of upbuild
ing.
Moreover, agricultural Egypt Just
began to gather headway during the
past ten years. It was Just beginning
to realize a fraction of the production
that a proper development of its lands
could be expected to bring about. Its
out-of-seuson vegetables, grown at a
time when the fields of Europe's great
vegetable gardens still He frost-bound,
had enjoyed scarce half a decade of
demand in northern markets, though
they compared In quality with th*
fancy vegetables, the first aristocracy
of vegeta Ido foods, grown on the little
garden p'ots In Northern France and
In Belgium, the coaxed and coddled
cultivations of zealous small garden
ers. Egypt gave promise of becoming
England's fairest farm.
Bathtub Under Sink.
"By utilizing the space ordinarily
wasted beneath a kitchen sink as a
place of concealment for a bathtub,
a curious plan has been evolved
for providing bathing facilities In
cramped houses without toilet rooms,"
says Popular Mechanics Magazine*
"The sink and its accompanying drain
board occupy the top of a movable
cabinet of neat appearance. The
backboard of this is permanently fixed
to a wall, and water faucets are at
tached to it immediately over the sink.
The bathtub Is permanently installed
beneath tl o cabinet and at the front
end supports a small basin, connect
ed with the waste pipe, Into which
the water from the sink Is drained.
Normally the bathtub is entirely out
of sight. When It is to be used, how
ever, the cabinet, holding the sink, Is
moved away from the wall to give
free access to It. Water Is then sup
plied through faucets attached to the
board above.”
Thief Quotes the Bible.
A religious grape thief defended bis
thefts when ho tacked to the fence of
C. A. Parker, a vineyardist, a quota
tion from the Bible as follows:
“When thou comest into thy neigh
bor’s vineyard, then thou mayest eat
grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure;
but thou shalt not put any In thy ves
sel.’'
Numerous complaints have been
made to the sheriff's office about
people stripping the vines of grapes.
Parker was one of the last to com
plain, and now the thief has justified
his act.” —Fresno (Gal. I DUnajUd^
