make a dollar by simply listing—we refuse a great

ganization of bringing buyers is second to none in
the Northwest. If there is any business going, we
will get our share. If we didn't think we could sell
your land, we would not spend money advertising
for it. We have customers now in sight for 160,
240, 820, 640, 960, 1280, 1600 and 1020 improved

statement in regard to the matter:
"A tew months ago, I asked a couple
of state's attorneys to prescute un
der the law known as the Bootlegging
law (House Bill 114) to test the "alld*
ity of the referendum petltit-n. I
have considered the petition very
carefully and have come to the con
clusion that there is a grave doubt
whether the petition is valid, and It
the bootlegging law has been refer
ered. And I will advise the state's at
torneys to disregard the referendum
petition and to prosecute as if no pe
tition had been filed."

Congregational Church Bulletin
Sing you a song in the crarden of life,
If only you gather a thistle
Sing you a song,
As you travel along,
And if you can't sing—why, ji^st
whistle.
He went so blithely on the way
Which people call the Road of Life,
That good folks who had stopped to
pray,
Shaking their heads, would look and
say,
It was not right to be so gay,
(Jlion the weary road of strife!
He whistled as he went and still
He bore the the young where streams
were deep,
And helped the feable up the hill,
He seemed to go with heart athrlli,
Careless of deed, and wild of will:—
lie whistled that he might not weep.
Think truly, and thy thoughs
Shall the worlk's famine feed
Speak truely, and each word of thine
Shall be a fruitful seed
Live truely, and thy life shall be
A great and noble ereed.
