Anxiety Caused
by Mexican News
OVER REPORT THAT HERRERA'8
TROOPS HAVE JOINED VILLA'S
IS COMPLEX SITUATION
Rebellion in Carranza ' Army
Would
Call for Immediate and Strong Re
inforcements for American Forces
New in Mexico.
Washington, March 22, Grave ap
prehension regarding the outcome of
the American expedition Into Mexico
in pursuit of Villa was evident for toe
first time In Washington tonight after
receipt oy tne war department of i
despatch from General Funston say
lng a report had reached him that
2;600 Carranza troops at Chihuahua
under General Luis Herrera had re
volted and aligned themselves with the
bandit chief.
Information from Funston.
General Funston did not disclose the
source of his information and so far as
cquld be learned no conHrmation had j
rXirlw1 t l e4ta rlanatHe. Aaa m. '
Mexican .embassy. Fear that the re
wseu til IT (1 V VI
port might be true was not diegulsed
in official circles, however, and to
night's developments were awaited
with tense anxiety.
Fear Others May Revolt.
If Herrera and his troops have Joined
Villa, some officials believe other Car
ranza commanders and soldiers may
quickly follow their example. In such
an event, the United States and de
facto government of Mexico would find
themselves confronted with a situation
so serious that its possibilities hardly
could be estimated. A large part of
the forces of the de facto government
in nortnern Mexico formerly were
Villa soldiers and with their officers
have followed the bandit chieftain to
many hard fought victories.
Herrera'a Troops Well Equipped.
The troops under Herrera are de
scribed here as being probably the
best equipped in northern Mexico and
they are said to be well supplied with
ammunition. Herrera at one time was
one of Villa's most active aides, aa waa
his brother, who now Is believed to be
operating In the state of Coahulla with
a considerable force. Rumors concern
ing the doubtful intentions of the Ar-
rita brothers, leading a force in EHiran-
go, also have tended to Increase dis
quiet here.
'Reinforcements Would Be Rushed.

every available soldier would be rush
ed in to reinforce the advancing col
umns. For this purpose not more than
about 15,000 men would be available
without calling out the national guard.
There are now on the border in Mex
ico about 25,000 soldiers, and In the
whole of the continental United States
the other mobile forces number only a
little more than 5,000.
Conference of President and Secretary
Baker.
Ail reports from the border were
sent to the White House tonight and
were the subject of a long conference
between President Wilson and Secre
tary Baker. Afterwards Mr. Baker de
