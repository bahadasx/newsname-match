Secretary Baker, when asked today
if General Funston has asked for

"I think I will not answer that
question."
A message from General Funston
last night said that the motor truck
trains had satisfactorily solved the
problem of getting supplies to the ad
vance column General Funston had
been uneasy, it was said, over the sup
ply situation, but had reported no
shortage.
The navy department was without

quieting situation had been indicated
in unofficial reports. A message
from Admiral Winslow on the west

Wireless Is Interrupted.
Columbu6, N. M., March 23. Com
munication between the military base
here and Brigadier-General J. J.
Pershing's command in Chihuahua
was again Interrupted by intermittent
rains during the night. Both tho
wireless and field telegraph line were
hampered. However, it was expected,
that conditions would be normal later
in the day A quantity of wire ar
rived in the night and work of re
pairing the field telegraph was begun
immediately.
Although officially denied at head
quarters here as an "unfounded false
hood" reports persist In camp that
some of the motor trucks, carrying
supplies from here to the Mexican
field are missing together with their
drivers and guards. Two trucks
which left Ascension for Casas Gran

MEXICAN CRISIS
AT GRAVE POINT
Private Advices Confirm Story
That Herrera Has Joined Vil-
lista and Declared Against
U. S. and Carranza.
REBELLION IS SEETHING
Three Hundred Soldiers Under
Arms WatcrPEl Paso During
Night Strong Word
Sent to Washington.
El Paso, Texas, March 23. Private
advices reaching here today confirm
ed reports that General Luis Herrera
had Joined tho Vllllstas and left no
room for doubt that tho Mexican cris
is had reached a point fraught with
the most far-reaching and seriouB con
sequences to this country.
Not only was It accepted here as
definjto that Herrera had declared
against both Carranza and the United
States, but It was asserted with equal
confidence that Torroon was also in
the hands of tho Vlllistas and that
all northern Mexico was Beethlng
with open rebellion agalnBt the do
facto government.
Drastic Steps Planned.
So grave was the situation regarded
here that tho military authorities
planned today drastic steps to relieve
all Mexicans in El Paso of any arras
they might have concealed In tholr
homeB and enforce what would be
practically martial law in "llttlo Chi
huahua" tho heart of El Paso's Mexi
can section.
El Paso Sleepless.
, , AJJ njh& lon-JEl PaBpr-waited fl&BIh
w
lessly for the warning whistles which
would tell that the long expected out
break had occurred. Three hundred
soldiers with machine gun detach
nents waited under arms for any
iniergoncy and the police reserves
''quipped with rifles, were also hold
eady. Again and again rumorB ran
hrough the town that shooting had
been heard in Juarez but each timp
.hey proved baseless.
It Is understood that government
officials here have Bent to Washing
'on a recommendation, couched in the
itrongest terms, urging that steps be
"aken to disarm all Mexicans along
the border, taking the right of forcible
entry and search If necessary. Up to
the present, it Is said that the Wash
Ington authorities opposed such a step
on the ground that it would be misin
terpreted by tho Mexicans as discrim
ination against them and in violation
of their rights. It Is now Insisted by
the local authorities that tho time
has passed for any delicacy in hand
ling the situation. It Is pointed out
that no American is permitted to en
ter Mexico armed and that there has
been a far greater laxity on this side
of the border than was desirable.
, Bitter Feud In Juarez.
The situation in Juarez remains
mostly a subject of conjecture with
such items of information as are ob
tainable bearing a decidedly sinister
aspect It is known that a bitter feud
exists between, the mayor, Manuel
Prleto, and the military commander.
General Gabriel Gavlra. Prieto Is a
staunch Carranzlsta while Gavlra Is
devoted to the interests of General
Obregon, Carranza's minister of war,
but who at the same time is known to
be bitterly hostile to the first chief's
program especially as It relates to
co-opration with Americans. Gavlra
troops are divided between Obregon
istas and former Vlllistas.
Whatever may happen in Juarez
there is no supposition here that any
attack would be made on El Paso
from the other side of the river but
there is the greatest apprehension
that an outbreak on the one side
would inevitably be 'followed by an
outbreak on the other.
35,000 Mexicans In El Paso.
There are about 35,000 Mexicans In
this city Rut of a total population of
71,000 and the majority of Mexicans
belong to the lowest and most lgnor;
ant portion of the people. The mili
tary and civil authorities have made
vigorous efforts to forestall any
trouble by arresting every Mexican
who was suspected of inciting their
fellowvcountrymen against Americans.
That such a system, apparently or
ganized, has been carried on for some
time, has been well known. Numer
ous arrests have been made, especially
among the VllHsta colony, which Is
quite large.
Police and Detectives Busy.
The police last night renewed their
efforts and detectives were sent into
every section of the city who arrest
ed between fifteen and twenty Mexi
cans suspected of being engaged In
anti-American plotting. The most im
portant arrest was that of Melchor
Herrera, brother of General Luis Her
rera. Herrera was arrested as he
crossed the international bridge af
ter a prolonged conference with Gen
eral Gavlra at Juarez. According to
the police, they have proof that a
plot had actually been perfected by
Herrera and his associates to start
rioting on a large scale In El Paso.
Two hundred men were said to have
been enlisted as a nucleus, having
been won over by glittering promises
.. . i i.1. .1.1 nnln flir ltn.
oi me Dooty uiu uum b.u. .. .. i-
lice storv goes that tho plans of Her
rera anticipated that as soon as tho
rioting started large numbers of Mex
icans would join them.
Strict Military Precautions.
The precautions adopted by the mil
itary and civil authorities were not
relaxed today. They were In part the
result of General Funston's orders
that especial steps should be taken
at all points "along the border to safe
guard American lives and property In
view of the reported disaffection of
General Luis Herrera and other Car
ranza chieftlans in northern Chihua
hua. The belief of Americans who are
familiar with Mexican affairs was that
if the reported revolts in Chihuahua
seriously shook the power of the first
chief, It would not be long before
there was trouble in Sonora. This
state is the headquarters of the Oh
regonistas and has, nover, according
to information here, been more than
lukewarm to the Carrauza cause. It
1 1b the native state of General Obregon
and the people are said to be devoted
to his interests. General Calles. the
military governor of Sonora, Is known
to be an out and out Obregon adher
ent, and in his recent fiery attacks
upon the clentlficos and clericals, com
bined with his proposal to confiscate
all concessions granted by Huerta
and Villa, have given ominous force
to tho persistent rumors that ho is
not only anti-American but sympa
thizes at heart with Villa. It Is cer
tain that a large number of his most
trusted officers are former Vlllistas
who were implicated with the bandit
chief In some of his most notorious
exploits.
Whatever bo tho outcome, the ner
vous tension along tho border has in
creased to such an extent that most
Americans frankly admit that they
would prefer a deflnito sundering of
relations between Washington and
the do facto government, to a con
tinuance of the existing situation.

VILLA HAS BASE
NEARIMIPPA
Re-organizing Command and
Recruiting New Men for
Army to Fight General
Pershing.
GRAVE CONCERN FELT
Early Agreement With Car
ranza to' Use Railway Lines
Greatly Desired Outlaw
Equipping Men.
El Paso, Texas, March 23. Pancho
Villa has established a base to tho
v cstward of Namiquipa to re-organize
his command and recruit new men for
his army is a report current here to
day. At this new base, It was said.
Villa would fay his plans to operate
with the force of General Luis Her
rera, who is understood to have re
nounced the de facto government. The
American army base at Columbus has
had no news of Villa for over two
days. So far General Pershing's for
ces have not come In contact with the
outlaw and his band.
General Luis Herrera, until a few
days age in command of the Carranza
gcrnson, Is said to be moving north
westward to effect a juncture with
Villa and .this, In connection with re
port that the Carranza garrison at
Torreon had revolted, has occasioned
grae concern among the army offi
cers in El Paso. Villa's men, aug
mented by the command of General
Ilerrpra, said to number 2000 well
equipped soldiers, might be in a posi
tion to harass General Pershing's
army and seriously interrupt the line
of communication between the ad
vanced base of American forces at
Casas Grandes and the main base at
Columbus.
An early agreement with the Car
ranza government for the permission
to use Mexican railway lines is great
ly dosired by army officers. Tho
main base would then be transferred
from Columbus to this city and the
Mexican Northwestern railway could
bo used to ship men and supplies to
Casas Grandes. The "railroad could
easi'y be maintained against interrup
tion while the present line southward
out of Columbus over a desert might
readily be cut should Villa recruit a
formidable body of men. Villa is said
to have sent agents among the popu
lace in the mountain districts urging
them to support him against the
Americans Tho outlaw is reported
to be equipping his men with arms
and ammunition which ho has had
cached for some time. He has plenty
of good mounts and, once his com
mand is ready, Villa will he In a posi
tion to start a guerrilla campaign
against the American army.
Thero is no confirmation of a re
port that Colonel Cano, of Carranza's
army, has joined forces with Villa.
All was quiet In Juarez early today
and street car service which was sus
pended last night for fear of trouble
in that Mexican city, was resumed
this morning The railroad bridges
and tunnels are still under guard.

quarters. San Antonio, Tex., March 23. Gen
eral Funston proceeded today with his
plan of preparation to meet tho al
tered situation that would be created
by any injection of new forces into
the Villa organization that General
Pershing is fighting.
No report has been made to Gen

taken.
"Otherwise the general situation on

Russians Take Aggressive.
"Eastern front: The Russians
showed their main aggressive activity
in the evening and night time. They
ndvanced several times with strong
forces against the German positions
and bridgehead of Jacobstadt on both
sides of the railway between MItau
and Jacobstadt( and four times against
the Gorman lines north of Vidzy.
"On the front northwest of Postavy
the number of prisoners taken us has
reached fourteen officers and 889
men. The Russians in this district
undertook no more important attacks,
apparently on account of the over
