Columbia.
The state department of education
has just completed the examination,
.approval and payment of the rurul
graded school aid appropriated by the
legislature." The item in the appropriation
bill carried $120,000 for consolidated
and graded schools in country
districts. Schools with an enrollment
of 50 pupils, an average attendance
of 30, a term of six months, two teachers,
a four mill tax. a two room building
and the minimum equipment prescribed
by the state board of education.
feceived $200; schools with an
enrollment of 75 pupils, an average of
attendance of 40, a term of seven
months, three teachers, a four mill
tax. a term of seven months, three
tax, a three-room building and tho min- j
Jmum equipment prescribed by the
state board of education received $300.
In every case state aid is granted
upon the written showing made by the
trustees, county superintendent and
teachers.
The standard prescribed in the law
requires one teacher for each 25 children.
Tliis is exceedingly low. but it
was adopted In 1912 in the hope that
,a larger number of the country districts
mi eh t tie indncen in imnmifo
conditions. This hope of the lawmakers
has been fully realized. The
appropriation has steadily risen year
by year from $15,000 to $120,000. The
number of sttite aided schools lias increased
from 58 to 559.
For the scholastic year 1914-15 the
rural graded schools numbered 400;
t? for the scholastic year 1915-16 they
show a net increase of 159. This unprecedented
growth of nearly 40 per
cent is an index to the rural school
development of the state. Supt. J. K.
,Swearingen. in commenting on the
figures said that he confidently expected
eight or ten helated applications
which have been reported, but have
not yet been filed.
"To meet the excessive demands, the
state superintendent was compelled to
use $12,000 from the contingent fund."
,Mr. Swearingen said. "This course
was followed because districts voting
A four mill tax and trying to run six
or seven months ought not to be deprived
of state aid after trustees have
made their contracts on this basis.
.1 hope that the time may soon come
when the patrons of every school will
vote a local tax for their district and
run a term of not less than seven
months.
"If this deficiency had not been
made up out of the contingent fund 53
schools would have been compelled to
close prematurely. The legislature
must either increase the appropriation
or raise the requirements for state
aid. Practically one-third of the
school districts of the state have received
improved facilities through the
law.
"This gratifying growth ought not
to be checked. An Intelligent rural
.population can not be trained in
schools running less than seven
4UIIUUIB. <\i leiim buu oisiricis are
preparing to qualify for rural graded
school aid during; 1916-17. To meet
tho demand, an appropriation of not
Jess than $175,000 will bo necessary."

county shall issue bonds for permanent
highway improvement. It follows:
"Issuance of these bonds will
not increase the tac levy. The only ad

one on account of them is the license

to be derived by the owners of vehicles
will be greatly in excess of the

DISPATCH FROM GEN. GAUIRA
SAYS BATTLE WAS FOUGHT
AT NAMIQUIPA.
THINKS DE FACTO FAILED
I
, Don't Like Carranza's Co-Operation?
j Part of Forces, Withdrawn?Americans
Can't Have Railroads.
El Paso, Texas.?The forces of Col.
Cano were engaged In battle with bandits
led by Villa in Namiquipa. according
to a dispatch received by General
Gavira, Carranza commandant at
Juarez. The result of the fighting was
not decided at the time of the receipt
of the dispach. Namiquipa is in the
district of Guerrero, state of Chihuahua.
Colonel Cano is in command of a
force of 900 cavalry which came in
contact two days ago at El Valle with
Villa forces which on this occasion
fled without giving battle.
Despite the reports that General
Cano's forces had engaged those of
Villa at Namiquipa. persons well informed
here expressed the opinion that
I the Carranza forces had failed to hold
up their end of the net by which It
was proposed to capture the bandit
chieftain. There were confirmatory
reports received of the news received
for the last week that the Mexican
troops not only were failing to co-operate
with the Amrican troops, but in
! certain instances at least, were actui
ally withdrawing from the field of
| operations.
The Associated Press learned on
I unquestionable authority that the
troops of the de facto government
which had been seen at Casas Grandes
! have been withdrawn and are now in
about Juarez. -From tbe same source.
- it was learned that at least one detachment
of Carranza troops had refused
i to fight Villa and had withdrawn on
the bandit's nnnrtiaeli 1bbwIiii? him frun
to pass into his favorite mountain fastness.
This detachment withdrew on
receipt of a message that lie was warring
not on Mexicans but the enemies
of Mexicans.
There is no question that there is
serious and growing uneasiness in El
I Paso which has been sharply accentui
ated by the problem which has arisen
' over the request of the United States
government to General Carranza for
the use of the Mexican railroads to
1 transport supplies. Americans here
do not believe that Carranza dare
grant this request, especially as it is
| understood that Geheral Funston proposes,
if it is granted to take train
crews and equipment into Mexico and
place military guards at the stations.
The presence of American soldiers on
j Mexican railroad, it is said, is very
likely to be misunderstood by the
peons and it is feared, would be sure
to provoke outbreaks.

CENSORS ARE VERY STRICT:
i
EVEN WASHINGTON DOES NOT
KNOW WHEREABOUTS OF
PERSHING'S MEN.
Villa is Far in South and it Will Require
Several Days For U. S. Soldiers
to Reach Territory.
Washington.?An impenetrable wall
1 of secrecy surrounded the movements
1 of American troops beyond the Mexi!
< an border. So far as official Washington
was advised the columns virtually
might have vanished into thin
air when they crossed the interna|
tienal boundary in pursuit of Villa.
Even the commander-in-chief, President
Wilson, did not know where General
Pershing's men were.
Secretary Baker received virtually
no reports from General Funston dealj
ing with events beyond the border.
He said he did not know whether the I
; troops had proceeded southward from
their tlrst bivouac on Mexican soil.
I Not a single dispatch from the border
! was made public during the day except
| one reporting the death of Lieutenant
, /.ell. Eleventh Cavalry, at the Colum|
bus hospital where he took his own
life in a fit of despondency.
| Army officials were convinced that
no important developments were to
I oe expected ror several days yet. It
l seemed plain from the day's aecu1
mutation of rumors that Villa was
| fat to the south of his American purI
suers. The War Department would
not divulge any details of the number
of troops across the border or of
the regiments sent. Press advices,
however, showed that infantry accompanied
the cavalry and artillery out
of Columbus in the main column.
That means slow progress across the
desert. It will take days, it is said,
to cover the distance to Galena, the
last town where Villa was reported
unofficially to have been seen.
American consuls in Mexico so fathave
been able to give little aid to
the troops, although all are on the
watch for information that might indicate
the bandit's movements. Consular
advices continued to report generally
quiet conditions. Officials displayed
some concern over the situation
in the Tampico district, however,
where there are signs of unrest. The
battleship Kentucky was ordered back
to Vera Cruz front New Orleans, Secretary
Daniels exnlainine that nnw
vessels now on the Mexican coast did
not have radio equipment powerful
enough to insure uninterrupted communication
with Washington.

of a German infantry attack launcsult
of a German infantry attack
launched with huge effectiveness after
a heavy bombardment against French
position at Le Mori Homme, northwest
of Verdun. The Germans, who
attacked in serried masses, were driven
eastward toward the ,Hois des Corheaux.
where the French guns inflicted
heavy casualties on them.
The attack at Le Mort Homme consttuted
the only infantry maneuver
along the entire French front, but from
Belgium to the Vosges. the artillery
on both sides has been active at numerous
points.
Around Douamount and the village
of Vaux the big guns are operating
with redoubled violence, while southward
in the Woevere the artillery duel

duels in the Mouse hills continue.

REACHES VILLA TERRITORY,
Details of Pursuit Are Withheld But
All Reports Indicate That Bandit
is Not Very Far Ahead.
San Antonio. Texas. ?General Pershing
led the greatest part of his force i
beyond ('uses Gramies and personally
began the direction of operations that
it is hoped at headquarters would terminate
in the capture of Francisco
Villa, according to army headquarters
lute. All the evidence secured indicated
that Villa was not many miles
away but whether he intended to continue
his (light or stop and fight still
remained unknown to the Americans.
General Funston withheld all information
as. to the details for the active
pursuit ot' Villa.
Two troops of the Twelfth Cavalry
arrived at Columbus ami have been
st nt forward to patrol this line along
which detachments of infantry also
have been stationed. From Columbus
to Cases Grandes supplies will be
moved by automobile trucks and wag
otis, and. if permission is secured,
that means of transportation will be
supplemented by shipments over tin
Mexican Northwestern Railway from
K1 Paso.
The negotiations looking to the
uses of the railroad as far south as
Casas Grandes had not been treinitiated.
according to General Funston
who pointed out what great assistance
the permission to make shipments l?y
rail would be.
General Pershing's wireless equipment
was operated to better advantage.
Trouble in communicating by
that means hat! been experienced but
messages are now arriving at general
headquarters with less delay and great j
er frequency.
None of General Funston s informr.tion
indicated the exact whereabouts
of Villa but there was a disposition
at his headquarters to regard
as perhaps true tiie reports coming
i imm umciai Mexican sources that lie
had reached Babicora in the district
of Guerrero, near his boyhood home.
CONGRESS MAY END EARLY.
Administration Leaders Hopeful of
Speed Action on Measures.
Washington.?Evidence of co-operation
between President Wilson and
adjournment at the capitol is seen by
administration officials in the action of
the senate ami house in advancing preparedness
legislation ahead of others
bills and practically removing the European
and Mexican questions from
the field of debate through votes supporting
the president.
Although some congressional lead
ers. notably Speaker Clark, say Congross
will be in session until Fall, administration
officials predict confidently
that adjournment would come late
in June or early in July.
A great legislative program still
awaits action. It includes the army
and navy bills, a tariff commission
bill, the Philippine bill, rural credit
legislation, several appropriation and
revenue bills, shipping legislation, revenue
measures and the immigration
bill. Comparatively little loss of time
is looked for. however, over any of
these measures except the shipping
and revenue bills.

OF VILLA ON MEXICAN
SOIL.

General Bertaini's Men Eager to En- !

Whereabouts of Villa Unknown.
Many Watch Soldiers Cross Border
Line to Begin Hunt.
Sail Antonio, Texas. Brigadier General
Pershing with more than 4,000
troops began the pursuit in Moxleo of j
Francisco Villa, whose raid aeross the
border last week caused President Wll
son and bis cabinet to decide to use
the fnited States army to run him
down.
General Pershing's report that he j
and iiis command had crossed the international
boundary line just south ;
of Columbus, X. M . have reached Maj. |
Gen. Frederick Funston. in charge here
of general operations, lteports of the
progress in the country where search
has been begun will be made by Gen.
Pershing to Gen. Funston, but it is not
anticipated that these will be frequent
or deal with any but the more important
developments.
How far into Mexho the column had
reached was not known here, nor did
General Funston appear greatly con j
corned. General Pershing's course for j
the next two days is known at head- I
quarters and not until after several
days are sharp developments expected.
Col. George J. Ootid, heading a smaller
column that entered Mexico some
distance west of t'olumhus, also is
moving in a southerly direction and
these two forces should be within
touch of each other soon. By that
time it is expected an infantry sup
port will hold the lines of communication
along which motortrucks for the
transportation of ammunition and supplies
will be operated.
The censorship imposed by General
Funston was relaxed hut efforts still
were made to k?ep secret the details

number of men engaged end their actual
locations.
General Pershing's report of his entrance
into Mexico served to dispel
to a groat extent fears in some
quarters that resistance would be offered
by troops of the de facto governnient.
Colonel Rertainl. the commander
of the Carranza garrison at Palonias.
on the south side of the dividing
line, promptly joined General Pershing.
His force was only some 40b men. but
they were reported to have displayed
willingness and even eagerness to Join
in the chase. As a body the Mexican
troops will remain under their own
commander, but a number of them are
being employed as scouts by General
Pershing.
General Pershing has gone into
Mexico with orders to overtake ami
wipe out Villa and his organization.
Unless orders to the contrary are received
front those higher in authority
than General Funston. the campaign
that was begun will continue
until Villa is captured or killed. No
limits have been placed on the field
or operations After the campaign is
well under way. it whs pointed out.
circumstances may cause restrictions,
hut just now the troops are prepared
to go anywhere to carry out the president's
orders.
There are now available in this department
for operations in Mexico
more than 2fi,fi00 troops and plans
for recruiting the companies to full
strength are expected to increase the
number quickly. Cavalry posts have
been relieved by infantry in most
cases in order to furnish a more mobile
force for the pursuit of Villa, although
in the expedition that went in
today there is a considerable force
of artillery which < an he reinforced
at any time by several more batteries )
now held on the American side within
easy distance of the border.
Bands affiliated with Villa in the
north have not indicated their inten- !
tions. luit brisk activity on their part
will not surprise American army of 1
fleers. It is anticipated that In chasing
Villa those hands will have to be
met from time to time and engaged.
Nothing in the day's reports indf- j
cated that the defection of the small
Carranza garrison at Ojinaga had been
| followed by other Mexican government
troops and action of Col. Bertaini's
troops in joining the American expediI
tion supported belief that most of Carranzas
forces would support him in
his promise of co-operation.
