Carlos Amy Making 75 Milt Trip
With SMwshois awl Dtg Team.
An event of importance the past
week was the arrival of Carlos Av­
ery, Executive Agent of the Minne*
nesota Game and Fish Commission,
on the Tuesday stage. On Wednes­
day morning Mr. Avery left for the
northern part of the county with
Mr. Chas. Johnson, whose guest he
was during his stay in the village.
He will spend a few days with the
trappers on his trip for the purpose
of becoming belter acquainted with
the game and fish problems. He
will travel to North Lake by dog
team and from there will go to Port
Arthur via the Port Arthur & North­
ern R. R.
On Tuesday evening the leaders
in the matter of securing trout fry
for replenishing our local streams
called on Mr. Avery at the Johnson
residence for the purpose of discus­
sing local game and fish matters.
A liberal it mount of fry will be re­
ceived some lime in the summer.
Mr. Avery also promises to send an
experienced man together with
seines and trap nets to try the ex­
periment of stocking the streams
above the falls where the falls are
loo high for the fish to climb. The
fish will be seined at the mouths of
the streams and will be transferred
to points above the falls. Another
project is the gathering of steel head
spawn. At the present lime Ihe
state receives all of its steel head
fry from the Federal Government
and if is found practicable this will
prove a great help to the Commis­
sion in restocking streams with lluit
fry-
The question of permitting li­
censed trappers to operate on the
Game Reserve was nUo discussed
and legislation will be soui/ht at'the
next session of the legislature to
permit this together with other
needed changes in the laws.
It is fortunate that those interest­
ed in securing trout fry are men
who have a good knowledge of our
streams and of their adaptability,
and that they are men who will
leave no stone uuturued to see that
the beat of care is given to the fry
and that they are distributed to the
very I •est advantage. In short, we
believe that this point will be
awarded a very liberal amount of
fry.
It is a pleasure to meet and talk
with a man of Mr. Avery's caliber
and to know that we have men in
public service whose interest in his
work and iu results is greater than
his salary. We hope that he will
visit us again.
Don't foiget the date—April 7lh.

Tbe farmer's club held a special meet­
ing Saturday eve, March 18th, for the
purpose of transacting business only.
The attendance was small due to the
elimination of all calico. This was quite
a blow to tbe suffragette movement in
this locality. Tbe ladies bitterly pro­
tested claiming the right of voice in
business matters on tbe ground that
tbey are alloted a large portion of the
farm drudgery and that th-y are as
much interested as tbe men, but the
elders of the bra-ferny sex only shook
their heads and declared'they could not
collect their wits if the women were per­
mitted to attend with their gossip and
the little ones wilh I heir squeaks and
squalls.

down too much timber in order that
tbey would have more stumps upon
