We believe in the principles set
forth by the Progressive national
platform of 1912;
That wo favor a 'getting together"
of tho progressive element of all
arties, and of all sections of the
country, under tho (banners of the
Progressive party, so that, with a
united people, we shall have that
strength and unity of action which wo
cannot have so long as those "who be
lieve in progressive govornniert are
ivided by remaining in the ranks of
the two old parties.
That until there shall be organized
ii efficient international government
to regulate International affairs and
controversies, wars will be inevitable,
and each nation must be prepared to
protect itself end its citizens. W'l
therefore believe in sufficient nation
al preparedness to protect our citizens
at home and abroad1, and to protect
our commerce on the seas.
"The world is appalled at the awful
conflict of war that has been raging
In Europe, and which thraatens to en
gul the world. The armaments which

ous nurden to the poople of every
land. The common Interests of man
kind demand a more complete am:
efficient government of international
affairs. The power to make laws, a
court to Interpret and apply the law

necessary to rood government. We
advocate the formation of an interna

congress and court, with jurisdiction
to regulate international afafirs and

FAIR PLANS
ARE MADE
BY COOPER
County Agent O. C. Cooper is busi
ly engaged in taking preparatory steps
leading up to the holdijig of the Grady
ounty fair next fall.
01 the 21 townships in Grady county,
11 have held elections for the purpose
of filling the positions of tnwnshin
fair committeemen. The committee
men from the townships wherein elec
tions were not held are to be appoint
ed iby the county commissioners. Mr.
Cccper will work out a list of possi
ble members for these vacancies and
submit the li.st to the commisisonera
at their regular monthly meeting in
April. Two members of the commit
tee will le chosen from each town
ship now having no representatives to
meet with the two from each township
in which elections were held.
Ten 3a$s. after the Txard .of com
missioners shall have made its ap
pointments, Mr. Cooper, as tho agri
cultural agent of the county, will call
a meeting of the entire forty-two mem
ters of the committee and they will
make the selection of a president, a
secretary and an executive committee
of five who will have charge of the
work of perfecting the fair arrange
ments. Mr. Cooper stated this morning that
ha 'believed the fair of Grady county
for the fall of. 1916 would far sur
pass that of the past fall. "The peo
ple of the county," Mr Cooper said,
"have learned from experience and
will known how to produce results
with a far less effort than was the
case last season. The fact that Crady
county climbed from eleventh to fourth
place at the state fair last fall wili
also' add materially in awakening and
keeping up the interest of all concern
ed and alive to the matter of placing
Grady in the first rank at the state ex.
hibit."

Foster Father Receives Fatal Bullet and
"Daughter of Regiment" Goes Back
to Billet Life; Later Sent
to England
By WILBUR S. FORREST.
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
LONDON, March 10 (By Mail.)
Phyllis Trenches, a bright, blue-eyed,
flaxen-haired baby girl of 4, today at
Bediford, England, is the principal fig
ure in perhaps the most romantic lit
tie story of the big war,
Phyllis is the adopted pride and joy
of the Bedfordshire regiment. Her
given name was derived from one
Private Phillip Impey, who picked
her out of a ditch in an isolated and
unromantic part of Northern France
while the Bedfordshires were march
ing by. "Trenches" is the only ap.
propriate surname for Phyllis becausd
Phyllis" lived with her soldier foster
parents in a cold and clammy trench
on the firing line for eight long days.
When and how this 4-year-old hap
pened to be in a ditch, wet and weak
from cold, as Private Impey's company
was passing toward the first line
trenches, probably never wjll te ex
plained. It was Impey, however, who
stepped out of line to gather the
child up In his arms. Bo Phyllis went
to tho trenches.' Within three days
she had recovered from exposure and
was the pet of the company, both
oflicers and men. Infant clothing had
appeared, seemingly from nowhere,
but there was suspciciouS evidence
that more than one khaki uniform had
lost Its shape in favor of the Daugh
ter of the Regiment. The best and
safest dugout and the softest trench
ted were Phyllis' and there wasn't a
soldier who wouldn t have cut off a
leg to make her happy.
The German trenches were 150
yards away. One day Phyllis was
missing. Shouts from the enemy
trenches helped to find her fhe was
boldly toddling in "No Man's Land"
toward the German lines. The Ger
mans were beckoning her on. A hun
dred Bedfordshires were ready in an
instant to risk their lives for Phyllis.
Two, who were quicker than the rest:
ran forward and got her and not a
shot was fired. ' After that Phyllis
ventured over the parapet sevea!
times. No German offered to harm
her and there was an understood
truce when the child appeared-
Eight days of trench duty for the
Bedfordshires finally ended. Phillip
Impey died from a bullet wound on
the seventh day and tbe company
quartermaster sergeant gladly became
father to Phyllis. She was taken back
to billet life and never allowed in
the trenches again. She was placed
iu charge of a company storeman who
had children of his own. He took great
pride In fathering Phyllis while the
company did duty on the firing Hue.
Six months later the company quar
termaster sergeant was wounded and
was sent back to a hospital in Eng
land. Phylis went along, She was
soon the ptt of the patients and nurses
and it was a ad day in that hospital
when Phyllis and her foster father
were sent to Bedford, the former to
find a home and the latter to con
valesce. Phyllis Trenches has a real heme
today and a real foster mother. She(
is still, however, the child of the Bed
fordshires, who have pledged them
selves to see that she wants for
nothing throughout the remainder of
her eventful young life.
