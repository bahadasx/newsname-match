ViWa Surrounded 1
But Not Captured
Francisco Villa has been driv'ii
into a trap by tr;e rapid advance
of the American troops,
according to information reeeivsd
today in wireless lispatches <
rom the front and in telegraphic i
lispatches to Gen. Gavira, the i
)arranza commander at Jaurez.
Everything Reenis now to de- <
>end on the ability of the Car- '
anza garrisons to hold their e.id {
f the net. On three sides of I
he bandit chief he is hemmed 1
n by strong carranza columns,
rhile on the fourth the A.mori- (
ans are driving foward with <
mazing speed. 1
Villa was reported in the, Bah- 1
ocora lake region a few nights t
go on the ranch of Mrs. Phoebe
learst, which he has ravaged i
everal times in the past. Bab- t
icora ia about 55 miles south of <
laleana, where one section of c
he American expeditionary
>rco has arrived and is pushing 1
irward at the rate of 33 miles a *
ay. A few miles to the east of
he bandit's position ia Namiqui- t
a, which is held by a powerful
arranza garrison. On the west
re the frowning barriers of the '
ierra Madre mountains barring r
le way to Sonora. Gen. Luis u
'uiterrez, Oarranza's field chief, v
eclares that he holds all the *
asses to Bonora.
I'he concensus of military opin- ^
>n seems to be that if Villa
lects 10 hold his men to ^
ther and olFer fight his capture
certain. Hut it is more likely (
mt he will hide. Should he do '
lis the search would resemble |
lat of trying to find a needle in
hay stack. We might Icok for
im for years in those moun ^

Town politics are beginning to

It seems that at last Harry's
suspicions ot the desperate

but in spite of this, traps continue
to be laid in the endeavor
to do away with the beautiful

to save his excitmc nt-lov
ing sweetheart from death.
