(TTORNEY GENERAL BARK
ER AND SENATOR REED
ATTORNEY General Barker doesn't
ecm to have much confidence in the
Jinccrity and unselfishness of Senator
lames A. Reed. Judging from a dis
Jatch to a St. Louis paper from Kan

fast week a surprising amount of anti

"Last summer when the Demo

that Major was a pinhead, that he was

before the people'in the fight for the
senatorship. -
"Now, behold heed discovers a

A LARGE number of Democrats of
Audrain county are insisting that Hon.
E. A. Shannon should be a candidate
for re-election to the office of repre

legislature the more influential he will
be. . . '
THE citizens and farmers who are
interested in ine aairy muuouj,
hat nhould mean every resident of
Audrain county, are requested to meet
Thursday at 1:30 at the office of the
wrfitarv of the commercial club in
the City Hall. The question of locat
ing a milk condensery in Mexico win
be discussed. In our judgement this
is a most important proposition at
this time. '

house. Then realizing he had been
shot started to the door. "Boys lie's
shot me," he said as he fell over dead
in the gutter on Promenade street'
. E. H. Gowan who had charge of the
restaurant with Smith said that Tom
had been drinking and had demanded
a drink of cider on credit On being
refused he became sullen and threat
ened to come around and get it him
self. He was going to do anything
and everything he wanted to as long
as he was in the place, according to
his threats. Both waiters ordered him
out of the house repeatedly.'
A little later Tom pulled a pair of
dice from his pocket and rolled them
over the counter. Smith walked to
him and demanded that he put them
away. Tom then picked up a must
ard bottle and started the trouble
which ended in his death.

COUNTY IMER DEAD
E. P. Rosenberger Died at His Home
in Montgomery City, Saturday
NightWell Known Here.
STORY OF ADMISSION TO BAR
Told How Three Drinks Admitted Him
to State Bar In the Earlier Day
of the State
Montgomery City, March 20. E. P.
Rosenbergor, perhaps the oldest prac
ticing attorney in Missouri and a wide
ly known pioneer of this section, dieJ
Saturday night aged 85. He was the
father of the former Representative
Emil Rosenberger of thiB county and
Miss Katie Rosenberger. The fun
eral was held at High Hill Monday.
After he had gained success at the
bar, Mr. Rosenberger used to enjoy
telling how he became to be a lawyer.
He was in the saddle business in High
Hill, and in the early 'seventies he
drove into Warrenton with a load of
harness.
Circuit Judge' Gilchrist, long since
dead, was holding court there. Tl5m
Powell, an early pioneer, who had had
no better educational advantages than
Rosenberger, had applied for a license
to practice law.
'If Tom Powell can practice law so
can I", reasoned Rosenberger, and he
also applied to the Judge for a license.
A committee of lawyers was appointed
to take him into a side room and ex
amine him as to his qualifications and
did so in this fashion:
"Mr Rosenberger, do you know good
whisky?"
"I think I do," replied the applicant
"Have you got the price of three
drinks?
The committee then led him away to
the nearest saloon, where' he was voted
a lawyer and a gentleman, entering
on his long career as a lawyer, reach
ing ovea half a century, in which he
accumulated a fortune.
ILLINOIS WHEAT DAMAGED
Springfield, 111., March 20. The
condition of the wheat crop in Illinois
is serious, according to B. M. Davi
son, secretary of the State Board of
Agriculture.
"We won't have more than a 60
per cent crop In Illinois," said Davi
son today. "The open winter is re
sponsible. Conditions in Illinois are
representative, in my opinion, of those
in Missouri, Indiana and Iowa."
Thirty-one per cent of the wheat
sown has been killed, .according to the
board's estimates and the living
wheat is only 6d per cent of normal.

Miss Alice Byers, 37 years old, who
