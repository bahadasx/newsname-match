Leaving out the total negro, In

alien women in America who have
resided here less than five years,
there are still 4,034,0!)4 wor-en
voters eligible to take part in the
next presidential contest.
How will this power be used?
"It will be used in the interest
of women," today anttwered Miss
Margaret Whittemore <Sl Washing
ton, I). O.i national organizer for
the Congressional union, who is
in Tacoma.
Miss Whittemore Is here to In
terest Tacoma women in calling
a convention In Seattle March 30
to organize a Washington branch
of the union, which is bucking the
Susan B. Anthony federal amend
ment for woman suffrage before
congress.
"As to how this power will be
used, if necessary to use it, we
will decide when the time comes.
"If the party In office,
which alone has ]>ower to if-
I"■n out and \nunt the Susan
H. Anthony amendment, does
so, there will be no need for
strikers, according to officers of
the Merchantmen's Navigation

been handled without any trou

'Tnlesß the party in power

"the vole of every free woman

drive home the truth that the
women of America stand for 'suf

"We are woikinu now to

"And if they do?" she was
asked.
"Tito voting women of the west
will use, their political power as
seems'best to further the cause of

"The convention at Salt Lake

"Already eight organizers of
