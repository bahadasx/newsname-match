CON lITIONS IN BOGUiLUSA BESTil i
EVER AND IMPROVING EACH DAY
Great Southern Working More Men Than Ever Before
Paper Mill Running Full Blast And Other In
dustries Report Brisk Business
Bogalusa is today enjoying a
a greater era of prosperity than any
time since the city was founded, and
indications are, conditions will con
tinue to improve from week to week.
The Great Southern Lumber Co..
are working, by far, a greater num
ber of men than at any time since
the mill was started. When the
new twinn was opened last Decem
ber, about two hundred additional
men were given employment, and
during the past several weeks large
crews have been working in the
woods where the storm did consider
able damage, The payrolls are to
day greater at the Great Southern
than they have ever been, and with
the lumber market firm, and the
car situation daily improving, indi
cations are, that the Great Southern
will be busier during the next few
months than in the past,
PAPER MILL BUSY
When work was begun several
months ago on making extensive
improvements at the paper mill a
large force of men were given em,
ployment until the number was in
creased to something like 260.
When the mill started to making
paper, about the same number were
retained, and they did much to im
prove conditions. Now the mill is
running full blast, and working in
perfect condition, with indications
that there will be no slack up for
many months. The entire output
has been sold for six months, and a
longer contract was refused, so the
paper mill is going to be a perma
nent industry that will result in
several thousands of dollars the
pay rolls of Bogalusa being increased
each month.
SHOPS A BUSY PLACE
The shops of the N. 0. G. N. R. R.
are working the usual large force of
men. Early in the fall the force
was the largest ever known, and af
ter months of work, all the running
stock was placed in perfect condi
tion, and the force reduced, but the
shops and yards are working over
the average number since the shops
were built.
CREOSOTE PLANT BUSY
The creosote plant is working a
full force and they are receiving
orders about as fast as they care to
see them come and twenty or more
men are given employment at this
plant.
LUMBER MILLS OPEN

IHEE IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW MEXICANS
PAPERS CIVE NEWS OF THE SITUATION
The Mexican version of the in
vasion of United States troops is
very different than the reports re
ceived in this country. Copies of
the "Regenaracion," published in
Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, Mexico, has
the following story, with large head
lines reading:
"General Villa Invades The United
States."
"With a following of less than
three hundred men, General Fran
cisco Villa has taken many large
cities in the Yankee's country. The
first town falling into the hands of
the Villistas was Columbus. N. M."
"Slaughtering five thousand
gringoes, the brave Mexicans push
ed their advantage to the interior of
the "thieves" country, killing many
men. Taking El Paso. Tex., with
ease he drove the large force of
American troops to the north. The
whole country is an uproar and
Villa's march is still unhampered
In Texas he got reinforcement of
around Bogalusa that have bgen
closed for a year or more are now
in operation. These mills do much
tovards adding prosperity to the
Magic City. The Louisiana Lumber
Co., located only a short distance
outside of the city running full
blast and working about 60 men.
The mill of the Bogalusa Mill and
Supply Co., is running every day
that logs are furnished and reports
from other sections are to the effect
that the mills which have been idle
for months are now operating every
day and making money.
BUILDING ON BOOM
The building in Bogalusa is going
merrily on with indications that
during the next few weeks several
contracts will be let. Four of pos.
oibly five business blocks are being
contemplated while scarcely a few
days pass that work is not started
on some new home.
Realestate agents report that in
quiries from other states are coming
'in by every mail and several north
ern farmers have located in this
section since the first of the year.
The automobile dealers report
that business was never better while
the banks of Bogalusa show that
the deDosits and surplus is growing
rapidly.
BOND ISSUE WOULD HELP
If the $200,000 bond issue is
voted within the next 60 days there
will be that much more money spent
in Bgbalusa during the next few
months. Labor and material will
get most of this money as buildings
and extensions will be started and
rush to an early completion.
ALL BUSY AND HAPPY
Everybody in Bogalusa is busy,
or, if not, it is because they don't to
work, and be happy. There is not
a vacant house in the city, while,
the demand is great. Before plans
are completed for a new house,
there is some family eager to take
it, so Bogalusa promises to surpass
the fondest expectations of the op
tomists during the present year.
NEW ENTERPRISES COMING
It has been definitely settled that
one or more big industries will be
located in this city. and most likely
the first ote, will be a paper mill,
equally as large as the present one.
A meeting will be held in the early
part of May, when this, and other
important matters will be settled.

fleeing with his family to Canada.
The coward at Yankee Capitol did
not even take time to join his fam

will be apprehended before he reach
es Canada. Long live Villa! May
he be the next Mexican president,"

U. S, TROOPS EXPECTED
TO CLASS THIS WEEK
Reports Are That They
Are Now Close After
Mexican Bandit
El Paso, Texas, March 22.-Fran
cisco Villa was in a desperate bat
tle with Carranza forces under Col.
onei Cano at Namiquipa tonight at
7 o'clock, El Paso time. Here the
bandit leader turned on his pursuers
and made a stand after a running
fight which started at Las Cruces
during the forenoon.
United States troops from the
command of Colonel George A.
Dodd are hurrying to the support
of the Carranzistas from El Valle.
Another detachment is following
the trail which leads to the pass
through the mountains to Babicora.
It is believed Villa will retreat in
the direction of Laguna Babicora.
Reports indicate the Americans
will be in the midst of the fighting
before daylight, either at Nami
quipa or the mountain pass. An
engagement at the latter point
would give Villa a distinct advan
tage, as he is expected to give fight
from the mountain slopes.
The total number of United States
troops now in Mexico was fixed at
eight thousand by an army authori
ty today. Half of this number have
crossed the border since the origin
al expedition started out. Others
are still going south.
Villa is said to have about 1200
men. He is said to stand and fight
only because of the Mexican sympa
thizers working northward, well
supplied with ammunition, who
joined him at Namiquipa. The
Carranza force is estimated at less
than eight hundred men, The
strength of the detachments is not
given.
SECRET SERVICE WORKIIGS
SEEN III "THE MAN IISIDE"
One phase of our Government con
cerning which very little is known
and which always commands our
closest interest is our Secret Service.
Whether in novels, dramas, short
stories, or in the photoploy, the
characters who unravel the mys
teries confronting our relations with
other Governments have for us a
weird fascination.
Edwin Stevens, the well known
legiltimate star. who makes his debut
in moving pictures in the Broadway
Universal Feature production, "The
Man Inside." a drama mn five acts
adapted from the novel of the same
name by Natali Summer Lincoln,
which will be seen at the Magic
City theatre on tomorrow, Friday
gives the secret service a hard
problem to solve. Assisted by an
exceptionally able cast, he creates a
role in "The Man Inside" that is
one of the best ever afforded him in
his long stage career.
The story treats of diplomatic life
in Washington and is replete with
thrilling and gripping situations.
It bids fair to be the big film sensa
tion of the year.
Making Extensive Repairs
Extensive repairs are being made
at the Bogalusa Stores Co. En
trances are being cut trom all de
partments so that you can go from
