The Children
It is to be supposed that all parents love their children,
but some have queer ways of showing it!
Here are three things that The CITIZEN thinks parents
ought to do (or their children:
First, teach them everything the parents know how
to work, how to behave, how to control themselves.
Second, see that they get good schooling.
Third, prepare them to manage themselves and their
own affairs when the parents are gone. For this purpose
give every child a garden plot or something to manage
by itself.
Farmers' Plans
Right now is the time when every farmer is begin
ning spring work in earnest.
Some are working at haphazard, some on short plans
for one season only, but the wise ones are planning at
bast threw years ahead so that the crop and work of one
year shall help the crop and work of the next year.
Our boys have taught us by their corn crops in the
past two years that it is better to raise a bumper crop on
a small field than a spindling crop on a large one. Let
us mix brains with our sweat and get a better living out
of our land. If we take care of our land it will take care
of us.

Bird Houses
A splendid movement is on foot
among the ladies of the clubs to
cooperate with 3rd Vice President
of the Civic league, Carl Vogcl. the
newly elected chairman of the Com
mittee of Juvenile Improvement.
There is nothing more beautiful
than for the hoys to show their
sympathy and friendliness for their
little friends of the bird family.
This is not a local movement wholly
hut is a national one. On account
of the cruelty and neglect of the
birds they are leaving or not prop
agating their young about our
home where we most need them.
For this reason we want our boys
to get busy designing and building
bird house to be placed all over
town to accommodate our little
friends.

VILLA TRAPPED

Americans and Cxmocistas
Closing ca Eindit.
FEAR CLASH WITH CARRANZA
Mexican Chief Not Bol levee t Be
Deeply In Earnest In Deelr t Csp
tur Villa Carraoelstaa Battl
With Bandit.
Washington, March 21. -Late dis
patches received at th war depart
ment are believed to hav confirmed
th press reports from the border of
Villa's defeat 'by Carranza forces at
Craoes, and of his retreat In the di
rection of American forces at El Vail.
The dispatchea were telephoned to
Major Genera Scott, at his home at
Ft Myer, but he declined to make
them public.
El Paso, Texas, March II. If the
Information of the Carranclstaa Is
correct. Villa Is tn a corner, his back
to the wall, with American and Mexi
can troops closing In on all sides.
Tb continental divide forms the
wall and th Galena valley the Held
over which the American and Mexi
can troop are approaching him. Be
hind, th wall, with the possibilities
of approaching through It, la another
band of American troops. This Is,
according to official Information tn
Mexican circles, confirmed by Informa
tion through American military
sources.
It was announced by Carranza'a con
sul., Garcia, that the Carranza forces
at Namlquipa had headed Villa off In
his effort to break through to the
south, and that 'a battl waa raging
at that hour between the Namlquipa
garrison on on aid and Villa on he
other In the vicinity of Namlquipa. at
the south end of the Galena valley.
Nine hundred Carranclstaa under
the command of Colonel Cano opened
the battle. Villa has 300 men, th dis
patch to Consul Oamf a' declared. The
Cano troops or from the command of
General Gutierrez, tbe Carranza com
mander In northern Mexico.
If the Information is correct It
means that the Americans and Mexi
can troops are In a fair way to effect
the capture of Villa, for General
Pershing, It waa officially admitted,
la moving south from Gasas Grandes
In the direction of Babicora, and
should be almost west of tbe point of
battle. Should Villa win and manart
to escape southwest through moun.
tains to Bablcorn he would be met by
the Americans.
It was further confirmed that an
American column of 1,000 men, under
Colonel Dodil. is moving In the direc
tion of Ey Valle, which la north of
where the fighting Is taking place.
Another column of American troops
Is moving In the same direction be
hind Colonel Dodd. If the Mexican
forces are Insufficient strength to the
south of Villa, military officers here
say he Is completely hemmed tn.
Movement of Carranza troops north
ward continues In large numbers and
tend to bear out the claims of the Car
ranclsts that they are co-operating
with the American forces tn the cam
paign against Villa.
The Information came to Juarez
that General Maldonado had left Sal
tillo with a large force. It was an
nounced In Juarez that General Gut
ierrez, In command of Carranza forces
In northern Mexico waa well pleased
with the campaign against Villa, fol
lowing his recent visit to the border.
In American sources where the Idea
continued to prevail that the Carran
clstas are not as deeply in earnest In
their desire for the capture of Villa,
particularly while the American
troops are pursuing him, as their
statements would Indicate, the other
purpose to which a large Carranza
army In northern Mexico might be
put in an eventuality were also being
discussed at military and other quae
era. Significance la attached to such
large movements of troops In this di
rection at a time when negotiations
with tbe United States relative to th
ase of Mexican railroads for transpor
tation of food and other supplies to
th American forces now on th trail
of Villa.
American aeroplanes flew south
from Columbus into th vicinity of
th American forces. How far they
flew Is not stated, but they returned
to Columbus, and th Information tb
American officials possessed appeared
to b more voluminous than anything
they hav had sine tb Pershing
column departed. It la believed these
air scouts brought much news from
General Pershing for General runs

WORLD HEWS

The meeting of the Herman Reich
slag is awaited with much interest.
This is the representative body of
the whole empire and expresses pub
lic opinion. Von TirpiU, the Minis
ter of Naval Affairs, ha resigned and
his successor is appointed. He was
the originator of Germany' subma
rine policy and it is thought that
more humane and moderate policy
will be pursued, with fuller recogni
tion of the r'ghts of neutrals.
The rapid advance of the Rus
sians into Persia assures a check to
the Turkish operations against the
English in that direction. Armenia
is in their control and the way is
fairly clear toward Constantinople
along the southern shore of the
Black Sea. The Russians are not far
from the English in MesaDotamia
and they could cooperate in ease of
necessity.
The' fighting around Verdun has
been going on now for about four
weeks without decisive result. The
Germans continue to make vigorous
attacks along various line of ap
proach. The French succeed in
holding them back and have caused
explosions and fires in the German
stores of supnjy by the daring work
of aviators.
The Pope at Rome is striving to
make much of the period of Lent to
induce the Christian people through
out the world to think more serious
ly on present conditions and by fast
ing and prayer to bring about an end
to the war. Protestants may well
share in this effort
As a result of the war in Europe
the neutral nations are receiving
great supplies of gold in exchange
for their exports. The United
State has shared largely in this but
Sweden seems to have received pro
portionally the most. She has so
much gold that it has become nec
essary tq take measures to change
her financial system.
United States regulars, to the num
ber of about five thousand, have
crossed the Mexican border under
the command of General Pershing.
They are how well on their way in
to the northern pari of Mexico on
the trail of Villa.. No armed resis
tance has yet "been made but several
bridges have been burned to delay
the pursuiC The forces of Carranza
are cooperating cordially thus far.
It is thought that Villa will play a
hiding game rather than one of open
resistance.
; The Panama Canal, now closed to
vessels, will be opened for traffic to
the nations of the world before long.
