Government May Advise Farmers On Crops
iV
r
A now schemo to stabilizes market
conditions may bo adoptod by Undo
Sam, according to Farm and Fire
side, which says:
"Thoro is reason to believe that
boforo many yearj the Department
of Agriculture will bo nblo to begin
tipping off tho farmers to tho crops
that aro likely to provo most proilt
ablo under tho world's general con
ditions of supply and demand. It
would bo ono of tho greatest servic
es possible, but experimenting in
such a field would bo supromoly dan
gerous. "Despite tho dangers, thero Is t
growing conviction that such' an of-
fort at forecasting crops and advis
ing farmers will havo to bo attempt;
cd. The experience of largo and
small crops alternating with prices
very high when nobody had anything
to sell and vory low when overybody
had plunged, has been illustrated
many times, especially In potatoes.
A small crop and high prices tempt
too many peoplo to plant potatoes ox
tcnslvoly; overproduction lowors the
prlco and overybody gets out of po
tatocs us suddenly as ho got In;
high prices follow, and tho pendulum
swings tho other way again. It Is
bad for producer and consumer
alike." k '
"THE CALL OF THE
CUMBERLANDS"
ATITHE LYRIC1
i
Torn between a lovo for his moun
tain homo and a mountnln girl nnd
a desire to work out a Mod given tal
ent with paint wnrt canvas, Samson
South, fighter and dreamer nnd n
coming leader of the clans of tho
South, whoso feudal activities with
tho Hollinnn faction in the Cumber
land mountains have been halted by
n truce, leaves for Now York. Holuc
tnntly he parts with Sally Mlllor,
tho sweetheart of his youth, and
sighs at tho prospect of lost associ
ation with naturo's charms.
At tho zenith of his success, his
crudo ways fading under tho polish
of otlquot taught him by tho beauti
ful sister of, his artist benefactor who
discovered him in tho mountains, ho
Is prompted to return because of the
breaking out, of 'hostilities anew.
iMrst 8,verliiihg hlsr father's earlier
death, Samson Soutfi lends his clan
in a desperate battle with tho Holl
man faction, liberating four of tho
Souths from Jail and finally forcing
tho enemy to ask for permanent
peaco.
Sally Miller improves tho tlmo of
South's absence to add to her mea
ger education with books, and sho,
taking inspiration from fnshlon mag
azines, improves as bent she can her
personal appearance Tho nbsenco of
South lias built a brldgo of doubt ns
to whether his lovo for her has faded
or his heart yielded to tho pulchrl
tudo of tho polished city girl. With
Sally Miller again in his arms, doubt
Is dispelled and Samson finds his
soul In tho grip of a strong, heroic
lovo and his yearning for tho moun
tain fastness appensvd.
