Tribute of Respect
Zclda May Bowers youngest daugh
ter of C A Covert and wife was born
at Webb City Mo August 1 lhM
and departed this life March U 191G
aged 22 years G months and 25 days
The deceased in passing to her reward
made a profound and solemn impres
sion upon the whole community and
falls upon ninny hearts as a sad Iosr
and surprise since her illnes3 was of
short duration and death came un
expectedly from a throat trouble It
was all the more shocking to her par
ents and husband since no one realized
the seriousness of her illness
Her father and mother had spent the
winter with their daughter Mrs Stella
Magers in California and were on their
way home when the sad news over the
wires reached them notifying them of
their daughters death
The deceased professed faith in
Christ in 1007 and united with the
Presbyterian Church of Jasper where
she continued her lelutionship of a1
faithful member until her death I
She was united in mirriage to James
Willie Ilowers of Jisper on Scptimber
7 1011 and lo this union one son
Alvln Itussell was born and was 7
mouths old up to the mothers death
She leaves a lovinlg husbind her
child a father mother and one sisler
Mrs Stella Magers of California and
one brother Henry who lives near
Jasper on his fathers farm many
relatives and a host of friends to share
together this solemn loss
The funeral services were conducted
on Sunday March 1 at luVO a m In
the M E Church
One of the stroncest evidences of the
general esteem nnd respect with which
she was held is the fact that the
churches of the city called in their
morning serv ices to attend the funeral
Especially ltwas strikingly impressive
when the pastors of the M E Church
and M E Church South manifested
such a splendid christian spirit in
cooperation with the writer in the ser
vice The church could not accommo
date the throng of people who were
iinlous to show their respect by their
presence and sympathy
It was the privilege of the writer to
know Mrs Bowers ever since she was
only six years old At the time of her
conversion and joining the churchit
was his pleasure to receive her into the
church and administer baptism The
year in which the deceased was mar
ried she with her husband visited
Colorado and stopping in the home of
the writer while on their honeymoon
trip
This eodus of Mrs Bowers means a
bright light going out from the home
which she ever made happy and
cheerful by her affectionate and sun
shiny disposition
She was generally beloved because
other constant everyday smiles and
good will which she spread around
those whom she met and with whom
she mingled
It is generally conceded that no one
could feel gloomy or sad if Zelda was
around The young people not only
in Jasper but all over the county
