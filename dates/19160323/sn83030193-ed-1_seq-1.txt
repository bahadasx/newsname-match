Intensity and tho gnncrnl situation Is
unchanged.
This was a sudden shifting ot the

hero believed thnt theso attacks wero
feints to cover tho massing of troop
for another assault on tho lino be
tween Vnux and Douaumont, and the
action of Inst nlpht proved the cor
rectness of th theory.
Following Is the text of tho War

"To tho west of the Hlver Mouse

night. Tho enemy did not renew
his attacks on the llttlo hill of
Haucourt (about one kilometre
