Man is man 's worst enemy !
We are responsible for our
brother's wellbeing, whether we
admit the fact or not, or whether
it is mutually agreeable. We have
it in our pQwer to injure him and
he has a like power over us. We
may be mutual menaces, and the
worst of it is that 'we. don 't realize
it, or knowing it, wc don't care.
With rare, exceptions the dis
eases and distempers that afflict
us are communicable by germ
carriers from one human host to
the next victim. If we fail to
recognize the fact and act accord
ingly by protecting others from
ourselves, we arc guilty of a mor
al wrong.
The accepted theory of modern
medical science asserts that if tu
berculosis, yellow fever, malaria,
smallpox, ' typhoid fever, even
colds, bronchitis and many other
diseases could once be stamped
out everywhere, humanity would
be freed from them for all time,
because they are ' communicable
only by the transference of germs
and the germ of each disease can
carry only that particular disease
and no other. But so long as
these various germs continue to
exist, there is always the danger
of their spread to new victims.
i his declaration ot science is
not Utopian, because where prop
er and intelligently administered
precaution is observed, there fol
lows a reducing of the disease,
even of the commoner diseases,
absolutely stamping them out
within prescribed sections or ter
ritories. But to reach such results scien
tists and sanitists are powerless to
do more than to point out the way
It rests with individual men and
women, the people themselves, to
bring about the ideal conditions
of universal healthfulness.
The germ of tuberculosis makes
the patient the source of infec
tion, and it is evident that to re
duce the danger of infection, to
prevent the spread of disease, the
germ must be kept from reaching

So much is being said about
the Guardians of Liberty and
other secret political organiza
tions "that some outhoritative in
formation about them will un
doubtedly prove interesting. The
Herald, therefore, reproduces
from the Pensacola Journal the
following contribution from a
correspondent who claims to kr
the state lecturer for the Guard
ians. Most or the people oi rior
ida have doubtless read or heard
what Senator Bryan says about
them and it is but fair that they
be accorded the privilege of
speaking for themselves.'
, The Herald has no positive
knowledge of the objects of these
secret organizations and, there
fore, can neither, condemn nor
commend them. Whatever criti
cism The Herald has made on
them amounts simply to saying
that, these secret political or
ganizations appear to have select
ed and agreed to vote for the
most objectionable of the five can
didates tor governor.
But here is the communication
to the Pensacola Journal:
The Guardians who read your
paper desire space for the expres
sion of a few. sentiments that we
believe to be our due.
The Guardians are commonly
considered a political organiza
tion. Our movement is supposed
to be of recent origin.
I desire to show that both of
these impressions are wrong. The
parent of all the patriotic socie
ties is the American Mechanics.
This society was organized over
sixty years ago, and numbers ov
r half a million members in the
United States, and has nearly as
large a membership in Florida as
the Guardians.
The P. O. S. A., Knights of
Luther and "P's" all have large
memberships and are represented
in the state at the present time.
What brought these five orders
into existence?

in America an increasing foreign
population that is less assimilable

uary 1st, 1918; one $500 bond
January 1st, 1919; one $500 and

one $500 and one $100 bond Jan
uary 1st, 1921; one $500 and one
$100 bond, January 1st, 1922. The
principal and interest of said
bonds- shall be payable at Arca
dia.
The clerk was directed to pub
lish in the Punta Gorda Herald a
notice calling for bids for the
purchase of said bonds. (See not
ice in advertising columns.)
Road petition of James Carlton
and others was granted.
The engineer reported back to
the board the tabulation and re
port of the bids submitted by the
Cornwall Construction Company
and the Luten Bridge Company
for the construction of bridges
over Payne's creek and Little
creek, in special road and bridge
district No. 1. After due con
sideration it was moved and car
ried that the bid of the Luten
Bridge Company be and the same
is hereby accepted. The Com
pany agrees to furnish all mater
ials and labor and construct, com
plete, ready for the fill of the
roadway, the following named
bridges in special road and bridge
district No. I :
Bridge across Little Payne's
creek, 65 foot span, 16 foot road
way, for the sum of four thous

dollars ($4,195.)
Bridge across Payne's creek,
60 foot span, sixteen foot road
way, for the sum of three thous
and, seven hundred and ninety
dollars ($3,790.)
Report of the committee upon
the assessment of lands in the
Fort Ogden Drainage District
was received and filed and notice
given that the board, at the regu
lar meeting in April, will hear
any complaints that may be
made about said assessment. ,Said
notice ordered published in the
Punta Gorda Herald. (See notice
in advertising columns.)
Report from the comptroller of
the receipts and expenses of the
various county officers was re

cording to law.
The clerk was instructed to ad
vertise for bids for approximate
ly 399,620 cubic yards of excava
tion or grading in special road
and bridge district No. 5.
The clerk was instructed to ad
vertise for bids for one or two
traction engines of the caterpil

trucks of not less than sixty
horse power.

road running northeast from
Heard Bridge, across Peace river,
was received and was ordered fil

Guardians and have some know!
edge of the attitude of our con
temporaries" in the patriotic field,
and, so far as I can learn, not one
candidate has official support
from anv of the societies this
year. We vote our convictions
and arc under no obligations to
support no one.
What we stand for: Our slo
gans will tell the story best

Negroes are not eligible so far
as I know. I have administered
the obligation (which is an itera
tion of the sentiments expressed
in our slogans), to thousands of
men in several states and not one
negro was in evidence.
At a national convention a res
olution was passed which requir
ed separate jurisdiction if thev
were ever taken at all. We tried
to be white in this matter, as wc

If we cared to strike back, wc
might retort that some of our
critics are not altogether white,
for a yellow streak is in evidence
occasionally. Of this I am rca
sonably sure; The man who gets
our support must conduct a con
structive campaign and leave his

When our attitude and motives
are fully understood, we will not
lack for respect and good will
from all true Americans.

In an article headed "Just for
Comparison" published in The
Herald last week, there, was an
erroneous statement in reference
to the Bermont road in this spec
ial district. The grading at a
cost of $100 per mile, which is
contrasted with a grade being
made on the Fort Myers-Marco
road variously estimated to cost
up to $1400 per mile, is on the
Willow Pens road. The cost on
the Bermont road is higher than
on the Willow Pens road, being
in the neighborhood of $600 per
mile, but it is a different work
and at the same time the grade is
being thrown up a fine drainage
system is being provided.. And
even at this higher figure, the
cost is considerably less about
$800 less than the. 'work with
which the comparison was made.

Candidate Knott, probably the
leading man in the race to be
Hondas next chief executive,
says in his platform that, if elect
ed governor he will use his best
efforts to have the legislature a
mend the present libel law, which
vitally restrains the freedom of
the press. He believes in a free
press, and the legal right of di
tors in a freer, and fuller expres
sion upon all matters affecting
the state, its people and society.
The press of Florida has for years
tried to get the present libel law
amended, but without success. If
Mr. Knott is elected, the papers
will have his powerful influence
as governor to give us a libel law
that will permit some freedom to
expression. DeLand Reconl.

London, England An engage
ment occured Monday off the Bel
gian coast between four British
mil three German destroyers.
Two of the German vessels worn
hit. Four men on the British,
boats were wounded.
The official account states that
four British destroyers sighted
three German destroyers off the
Belgian coast. The German
stroyers at once turned and
for Zcebruggc, chased by
British destroyers. Shots were
exchanged during this short run
ning fight. Two enemy boats
were observed to have been hit.
British casualties wero four men
wounded.
The French war office state
ment announces that the German
forces again made violent attacks
against French positions in thi?
Verdun sector west -of the Meuse.
The Germans gained no success
except that they obtained a slight
footing southwest of Malancourt
wood. East of the Meuse the
night was calm. Since there has
been the usual intermittent bom
bardment carried on by both sides
The remainder of the west front
is without notable incident.
Russians Enter Ispham
A Reuter dispatch from Tehe
ran, Persia states that the Kussian
forces entered and took posses

of Persia, on March 19.
There is little other news from.
the Turkish-Russian front, or fhe
British-Turkish arena of opera
tions in Mesopotamia. There has,
been no decisive fighting in that
section the past ten days. The
Turks continue to fall back be
fore advance of the Russians who
are darwing near to Bagdad and
bid fair to come to the relief of
the British forces in Mesopotamia
soon.
Russians Thrust Austrians Back
The Austrian official statement
admits the loss of a bridgehead in
the Czernowitz sector to the Rus
sians, and have resuf ted their ac
tivity along the Gf ician front
and are hammering away at the
Austrian' defenses before Czerno
witz. The Russians have been
keeping up a sporadic attack in
that sector, harassing the Aus
trians day and night. A more
general attack by the Russians is
indicated.In the northern sector
of the 'Teuton-Slav arena, around
Riga, there has been little but de
tached fighting of late, but avtivi
ty in that zone may be expected
with the general return of warm
er weather.
Who would have thought that
the tin can is a menace to the pub
lic health? The expert malaria
investigators of the U. S. Public
Health Service have found, how
ever, that discarded tin cans con
taining rain water are breeding
places for the mosquito, which is
the sole agent in spreading mala
ria. A hole in the bottom of the,
empty can might have resulted in
the saving of a human life. Cer
tainly it would have assisted in
preventing a debilitating illness.
Empty tin cans have no business
about the premises anyway, but
if we must so decorate our back
yards, let's see to it that the can
has a hole in the bottom.
Senator F. M. Cooper was very
agreeably surprised on his birth
day, Sunday, by the arrival the
night previous of all his absent
children, who came, to celebrate
the happy occasion. They were:
Mrs. W. W. Jarratt of Marianna;
Frank M. Cooper, jr., and James
Cooper of Tampa, The last nam
ed was accompanied by his wife.
They had a joyous re-union and
a big feast Sunday. Next even
ing, the two sons and Mrs. James
Cooper returned to their homes
in Tampa. Mrs. Jarratt remains
here and will doubtless stay tilL
the end of next week.
