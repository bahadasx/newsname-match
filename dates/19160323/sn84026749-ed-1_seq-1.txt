Hindenburg's Troops.
IXWDON, March 23. Half a million
well-equipped Russian troops, under di
rect command of General Kuropatkin,
are now assailing von Hindenburg's lino
on . front of ISO miles.

the Vllna-Dvlnsk railway.
Offense Begins.
Whether Kuropatkln's heavy blows
are. the beginnings of a great offena-
, Ire' or merely an attempt to lift the
1 pressure on Verdun, t la too early to
determine. Th'aPetrorrad corres'poneT-
"ntof the Morning Post cables thatf
"the great Russian move has begun,
pointing out that Kuropatkin Is em
ploying large forcos.
Other dispatches from Petrograd de
scribe the Russian offensive as an
attempt to batter In the dungerou
German wedge In the Dvinsk region,
removing the threat of a German of
fensive on that sector when weather
conditions are more seasonable.
View of Critics.
This Is the view held by the majority
of London critics, who bellovo the
weather In tje Dvinsk region will not
be favorable for a great offensive for
at least a month.
Northwest of Verdun, the Germans
are striving desperately to capture a
dominant height In the Avocourt je
glon, from which to bring gun-fire to
bear upon French positions. Emerg
ing from the Avocourt woods, the
Bavarian roglmcnts found themselves
upon an open plain, raked by the
fire of scores of French Ktmi.
The German attempt has met with
some success. The official stntement
from the French war office admits
that the Germans gained a foothold
on Haucourt hill, between Avocourt
and Malancourt.

The committee expected to go over to

BY VOTE OF HOE
Garrison-Gardner Proposal Is
Overwhelmingly Defeated
Without Standing Count.
BODY WEDDED' TO HAY IDEA
Action Indicates There Is
Trouble Ahead for Conferees
on Chamberlain Bill.
Tho Houso today rejectysd a pro
posal to crento a "volunteer army"
elmllar to that proposed by Secretary
Garrison tefore he left the War De
partment. Resuming consideration of tho Hoy
umv bill, the Houso debated for an
hour the Gardner amendment proposlnr
a "volunteer army" Instead of a "Fed
erallzed militia." When thu vote was
taken the 'noes'" were of such over
whelming numbers that Congressman
Gardner did not even ask for a stand
ing vote,
Mr. Gardner's amendment proposed
an army somewhat similar to that rs-
poiised by Secretary Garrison, who was
tho orlsluator of th" "OonUnintl
Army" plan. Tho Massochusctta mem
ber has fought contlstcntly the. Hay

pponsorcd by Mr. Gardner was ofTored
in lluu of that section of the bill pro
viding for the payment by the Federal
Government, of certain sums to tho offi
cers und men of the National Guard.
The action of the Hcusu demonstrated
that Uio rower body is wr-dded to the
Hoy idea and that the Garrison-Gardner
plan for a Continental or olunteer
army has llttlo support in,'' ie ljver
chamber.
The "volunteer army" pfh l Is carried
In the Senate bill, which has been Intro
duced by Senator Chamberlain. That
there will bo troublo In conferonco over
this item Ih apparent, assuming that tho
Senate accepts the Chamberlain bill.
The House will make a determined stand
for building up and Federalizing tho
State militias, Instead ot creating a
volunteer urmy.
Congressman Gardner's amendment
today was presented to tako tho place
of section 76 of the Hay bill. This sec
tion provides that In tho Federalization
of the State militias the officers shall
bo paid from tho Fcderul Treasury sal
aries ranging from 3200 for a second lieu
tenant to JM for officers with tho rank
of captain or higher. Enlisted men, ex
cept when In actual service, will receive
one-fourth tho regular Day ot enlisted

Senators Sherman and Ashurst
Plead for Protection and
Vigilance.
Senator Sherman has prepared a new
resolution authorizing and directing the
President to call for 00,000 volunteers
for Mexican servico.
Tho new measure Is a Senate resolu
tion, which wlU not require cither tho
joint action of thn House or tho signa
ture of the President, nor will it neces
sarily bo referred to a committee.
Senator Sherman has ben led to
do this because it became clear today
that Administration leaders, headed
by Senator Stone, would try to side
track the original resolution by bury
lng It in committee.
lie laid emnhaals on tho conditions
which he believe call for such action.
He said he had lived ln Mexico and
that he spoke as one having a per
sonal acquaintance with the people
and the country.
"Why rlBk the lives of men on a
slender thread which may snan any
hour?!' asiked Senator Shorman.' "If
the northern states of Mexico should
be unfriendly. Brigadier General
Pershing and his forces are. ln .dangsr
of finding a hostile country In the
rear and no communication with our
country."
Ho characterized the. present policy
as "trusting to luck."
Senator Ashurst of Arizona, ln an In
terview, said that garrisons should be
doubled and vlgtlancQ exercised.
"I am fearful," said the Senator,
"that largA numbers ot Carranza troops
will Join VlUa and may glvo trouble to
General Pershing's expedition. The sit
uation along tho Mexican border, I be
lieve, Is graver than the departments
think It Is."
Senator Sherman took the flqor to
make It plain that he would call up his
resolution at tho earliest opportunity.
Senator Stone's anxiety to repress
debato Is taken to mean that the Ad
ministration is aiixloils to prevent the
Mexican situation from being aired.

EL PASO, March 23. (Jeneral Pershing has taken
over control of the Mexican Northwestern rllilroad south
of Casas Grandes, his base in Mexico, it was unofficially
stated here today.
He is said already to have begun transporting infantry
forces over the line to Madera, Chihuahua, in an attempt
to get behind Villa while Colonel Dodd's cavalry squadron
push the bandit's followers southward.
The American troops are reported to have been load
ed on the Mexican railway at Casas Grandes, Pershing
using equipment obtained from Pearson, and Casas
Grandes.
United States cavalry is understood, to be protecting
the line to. prevent raids by'Villista bands.
It-.is.tmknown'here whether Pershing forcibly took
possession of the line or received the permission of the de
facto government. Pershing took this action three days
ago.
With telegraph wires and rail communication intact,
the absence of official denial of Gen. Luis Herrera's revolt
it Chihuahua City was generally commented upon here.
A denial by Carranza Consul Garcia, based on Her
rera's reputed enmity against Villa, was Garcia's personal
c pinion. Herrera has been a member of both Carranza
and Villa factions at different times.
SAN ANTONIO, March 25. "If General Pershing is
rsing the Mexico Northwestern railroad south of Casas
Grancjes," said General Funston today, when informed of
a report to that effect from El Paso, "he is undoubtedly
ncting with the consent of the local Mexican commander.
I have no knowledge of it."

Mexicans in El Paso to loot and burn the city.
Eleven men were arrested, including Melchor Her

Night machine gun practice is part of the war exer
t'ise at Fort Bliss. As a result of the choking of the Amer
ican machine guns at Columbus during the Villa raid, be
cause the soldiers were unaccustomed to operating them
in the dark, the commanders at the fort are putting the
soldiers through nightly drills on the rifle range.
In addition to the rapid firers at Fort Bliss there are
others held near police headquarters, manned ' by 300
militia infantrymen, ready for service in case of a local
Mexican uprising or an attack from Juarez.
