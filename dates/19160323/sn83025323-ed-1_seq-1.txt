HANDICAPS .
In accumulating money for future use there are several
kinds of handicaps-advantages you give to or allow others
to hold over you.
One of these handicaps, self-imposed, is to allow your
neighbor to use the bank account plan for systematizing and
handling his financial aftairs while you continue to use in
dividual and unsystematic methods.
Come in and let us show you the many ways in which
the use of this plan will help you.

MORE BIDS OPENED.
March 15th at the local office of
the Reclamation Service bids were
opened for all earth work, laterals
and waste water ditches on a portion
of the first unit of the Bowdoin can
al near Strater.
The lowest bidder on the work
was L. W. Dotson of Glasgow, whose
bid was $9,006. The next lowest
bid was that of the well known con
tr actor, James O'Cbnnor of this city
for $9,362.
As has been the custom with all
previous contracts the bids have all
been forwarded to Washington for
approval, but there is no doubt but
what the lowest bid, that of Mr. Dot
son, will be the one accepted and
work will be commenced as soon as
the official notification of the award
of contract is received from Wash
ington.
MARRIED IN LOS ANGELES.
Sam Lee, one of the proprietors
of the Malta Cafe in this city, has
received word from the coast that
his partner and cousin, E.H.Lee,was
marries in Los Angeles, Cal., a short
time ago to Miss Margant Lum.
According to the Chinese custom,
the groom changes his name also
when marrying so the happy couple
will assume the name of Mr. and'
Mrs. Henry S. Kong.
Mr. Kong left Malta during the
winter for the coast, but his many
friends did not know on what mis
sion until the announcement of the
wedding was received by his part
ner in the restaurant. Mr. Lee. The
newly weds expect to arrive in Malta
about April 15th to make this city
their future home. The members
of the local Chinese colony have had
the brick residence in the rear or the
Malta cafe all furnished and ratted
up in fine style and this will be the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Kong when
they arrive. The bride, we under
stand, is one of the fairest of the
Oriental young ladies in the oeast
city and has been a trained nurse
in one of the hospitals of Los Ange
les.
The Enterprise extends harty con
gratulations and wishes thtet young
couple all kinds of happiness in
life's journey.
WOMAN'S CLUB.
One of the most enjoyable meet- P
iugs of the year for the- W.0mtn's
club took place Saturday afternoon t
at the Congregational church, Mes
dames Chase, Thompson and Runge c
being the hostesses. The peculiarly
pleasing feature was a practical de
monstration of cooking along do
umeitic science lines by Mrs. Chase -
and Mrs. Runge. Plain and elabor
ate menus for luncheons, together '
with the proper linen and silver ap
pointments, Were thoroughly dis
cussed: and this was further illus
trated by a table arranged for such
an occasion for the inspection of the i
club.
Several receipts were given, and
in addition were prepared and cook- <
ed before the assembled ladies,
proving to he triumphs of the culi-<
nary ability of the demonstrators. C
They formed a delicious portion of i
the luncheon which was served at <
the close of the meeting, and elict
ed the sincere praise of all those I
present. Much credit is due the la-f
dies for the trouble it took to give
such perfect demonstrations. It is
safe to say that no large club of the
largest. cities in the state can sur
pass the Malta club in the practical
work essayed and accomplished this
year.
The Malta Club will observe
Consumers' Week, April 3rd to 9th,
º in compliance with suggestions
which have been received from the
State Federation of Woman's clubs,
and in harmony with Gov. Stewart's
proclamation. The movement was
originated by club women to pro
mote and upbuild home industries
and has received official recognition
from the governors of six states.
The general purpose is to encourage
the purchasing of goods made by '
home manufacturers; and is a boost
to the increased prosperity of the
community and the state.
The county library was thorough
ly discussed, as it is being backed
by the Woman's club, the details of
which are given elsewhere in this is
Ssue.
As the club is raising funds for its
various civic and charitable enter
prises, it has been divided into four
sections, each of which has chosen
its own method for the purpose. Ac
cordingly the first section has an
nounced an afternoon sewing and
card party to be given on Saturday,
March 25, at the lodge rooms in the
old school building. Refreshments
will also be served.
Tthe next regular meeting of the
Woman's club will occur on April
1st, with Mrs. Flint, Mrs. Cooper
and Mrs. McKone as hostesses.
Street Commissioner Vert has 4
been about the busiest man In the '
city for the past few days, and is
doing his best to keep the crossings
in a passable condition. It is very
difficult for one man to take care of
the streets and attend to the pump
ing station.
Tihe registration list for the city
election has been posted and there
are a number of errors in the list.
Parties who have moved from ono
wanr to another have not had their
names changed, and the result is
that they will vote other than in
their own ward, unless they have -
the correction made at the clerk
and recorder's office at once.
BIG MEETING TODAY
Everyone in Malta and vicinity
should attend the big irrigation and
beet sugar convention at the court
house this afternoon. It is of vital
importance to each and every resi
dent of this locality. Be there and
show by your attendance, at least,
thlat you are interested in the move
ment to secure a beet sugar factory
fdi' the valley. The address of Mr.
I. D. O'Donnell will be well worth
your time to hear. Be a booster
aiid attend this meeting and then
keep right on boosting.
COUNTY LIBRARY.
Phillips county will soon have a
fine county library if the efforts of
a number of public spirited citizens
and the Malta Woman's club turn
out well. A number of petitions
have been circulated in Malta and
several other portions of the county,
and have been enthusiastically
signed wherever received. Accord
ing to the library law passed by the
last Montana legislature, after
twenty per cent of the voters have
signed these petitiions, they are to 4
be presented to the county com
missioners, who will pass on the es
tablishment of the library. Branch
libraries can be established where
ever wtanted in the county and
books can be sent by mail. This 'b'
will greatly benefit the county
schools, which find certain books `1
which tl y need hard to procure,
and is a step in the right direction
for the reading public of the coun
try. dI
Phillips county is the second to la
thus look out for library facilities, G
an enviable honor as against the ft
older counties of the state. Fort
Benton is the only one so far equip- "
ped according to the recent law, F
and their library has proved to be a "
bi.- success, and much in demand in u
all parts of their county. P:
The arrangement will be under "
the control of the county commis- h1
sioners, and the library maintained
by county funds. It will take very
little to keep it up, and is merely ir
nominal in cost. The Malta Wom- c(
an's club, which founded and has 1
maintained for years past the pres- a
ent town library, will donate nearly A
nine hundred volumes if the peti- c4
tions prove successful. This alone n
would give the new library a fine "
start. All farmers, who have ex- (
press-l their views on the project.
are nathusia-stic on the point, as
this will place good reading matter h
wvthin their reach, which many n
could not afford to buy. It will also
he of incalcuable benefit to rural
school children. and should receive o
e,-, ry one's cordial support. IP
