ANSWER to QUESTION No. 11
Question found in the "Detroit
Journal" of Mar, 10th. 1916. we
shall quote it,
it.
and also answer ;
QUESTION NO. 11.
Editor The Journal: I note
considerable controversy of a
religious nature going on thru
.Every body's column. I take the
liberty of asking for, light.
What is this thing they call
ray soul? Is it matter? If so
where is it located? what shape
is it? Where is this place called
heaven? Also the place called
hell? Is it a fact that hell is a
lake ofr fire fed by burning brim
stones' If so where does tbe
brimstones come from? An
intelligent answer to these
questions may be tbe means of
saving an otherwise lost soul if
there is such a thing to lose.
JOHN DESMOND.
1545 Iroquois Ave, Detroit,
Mar, 7. Detroit Journal.
What is the soul? This ques
tion requires thought- Soul is
life. iTbe Natural life. And the
Wor J tell us what this life is,
Please read.
"Every moving thing thatlivetb
shall be meat for you ; even as
tbe green herb have I given you
all things.
Bnt flesh with the life thereof,
which is the blood thereof, shall
yenoteat.'1 (Gen. 9-3-4.)
Here we have b fore us the
Natui-ai soul, This soul or life
dies with the body. But now
comes a two fold meaning of the
soul. There is the soul as above
explained and then comes the
living soul, That lives after the
death of tbe natural body. Tbis
living soul is Salvation or in oth
er words eternal life. This life
or living soul comes thru tbe
blood of Christ. As it is record-
d ja thjg )anKUaKe.
"But now in Christ Jesus ye
who sometimes were far off are
made nigh by the blood of
Christ. CEphe,, 2 -ta.)
, It took the blood of Jesus to
bring them nigh, and the reason
for it was, that life had to be
given, For tbe promise was Eter
nal life. Please read.
And tbis is the promise that
he hath promised us. even
eternal life. (1. John 225)
The Reader must understand
what the promise was. and then
we shall give you the record
tbe same, please read.
. "And this is the record, that
God hath given to us eternal
; life, and this life is in his Son.
(2. John. 5-11)
We cannot doubt those scrip-
tores, which gives us a clearof the lost. Souls that is cast
comprehension, of the differ-lout into outer darkness, can see
ence of the Soul and a Living; out of darkness into light, and
Soul. And tbe difference there
is in tbe two; for both-are life,
Abe one is the Natural life, the
'other is Spiritual life.
The next point h "Where is
this place called ht aven?"
There is three Heavens spoken
of in the Word of God. Paul was
panaht un into thei third heaven.
e suppose that this is the
place that the Inquiry is made of,
Heaven is space, and the third
heaven is the highest portion of
space attainable too- by the im
mortal part of man, after the
Natural body and f 'oul dies.
Then the Spiritual part of
man, or the living- soul, goes to
tbis space or heaven, called in
some respects puradise. The
abiding place of ttie - Spirits of
men, who die in Christ. Inor-
der to prove that space is called
heaven, we shall akyou to read.
'And God said Let there be a
firmament in the midst of the
waters, and let it divide the
waters from the waters.
And God made the firmament
and divided tiie ! waters which
were under the firmament from
the waters which- were above
the firmament: and it was so
And God called the firmament
Heaven: And tbe evening and
the morning were the second
Jay. (Gen. 16-7 -8)
This heaven spok.n of, is tbe
space we now live in, lor this
reason ws must say that tbe
third heaven is s;js oJso,
Tbe next question is, "Where
is hell?', It is space also. It
is beneath us, as tbe Word says.

wise, that he may depart truer
hell beneath." (Prov. 15-24.)
Tbis space or hell is a place
for the living Soui that dies out
of Christ. This space of hell is
a dark place. Christ said, "Cast
the unprofitable servant out into
outer darkness, where there
shall be weeping and gnashing
of teath."
Hell in this sense should be call
ed a place of torment, Inorder to
express the terribleness of this
place. God had John the Rev.
speak of it in this manner. "And
the devil that deceived them
was cast into the lake of fire and
brimstone, where the beast and
the false prophet are, and shall
be tormented day and night for
ever and ever." (R;v. 2050.)
This isthe second death, please
read.
And death and hell were cast
.into the lake of lire. This is the
second death." (lie v. 20-14.)
, Useing the word "Lake of fire
and brimsi jue, is only to express
I the terriable misery those lost
! souls are in. Christ also ex-

They cannot see the sufferings
of tbe lost. So hoping that Mr.

'QUESTION NO.'IO.

Dear Brp. and Ed.
. I have a question to as, for
under the Two Men theory every
thing seotns very reasonable and
also from a Bibicil standpoint of
view. Although I am some
what in the dark on the following
scripture.
Gen. 53. And Adam lived
an hundred and thirty years,
and begot a son in his own like
ness after his image, and called
his name Seth. Dear Bro. I
; wish some light on where Seth
'got his full blooded Jew wife
inorder for the descendants of
Seth to be full blooded. Jews, or
were the descendants of Seth
not full blooded .Jews. Bro.
please give us all the light you
can on this supject.
Dear Bro. Explain the descen
ants of Seth to be full bboded
Jews Gen, 53. Give us all the
light on this subject you can.
Your Bro. In Christ,

ANSWER to QUESTION No. 10
Who Is Setft Wife.
This is the first time since
we have became a minister of
God and His Christ that we have
been ask this question, we have
been ask a many of a time whore
did Cain get his wife and who
was she, And we have answered
the question time and again.
Gut tbis we repeat is the first
time that we have had the priv
ledgeof answering the question
above and we are proud that we
ciu. and that we are able to
answer it. -First , we say that
Seth was the first son of The
Man Adam who was placed m
the garden. And Adam was one
hundred and thirty years old
when he begat Seth. And Adam
lived eight hundred vears and
begat sous and daughters and
Seth lived one hundred and
five years, and He begat a son.
And upon the Law and Instruc
tions of God's word we must say
that Seth taken to wife one of
bis sisters. He bad over one
huDdered years to consider (or
'his wife and during this hun
dred years there was.-more. than

,.NO. 43.
one daughter born unto Adam.
For this reason we say mai,
according to nature" Seth had
ample oppertunity of getting a
sister to wife. God's law and
command to Adam would not
allow Seth to take a wife from
the race of the Created people
inorder that Seth should be in
the Geneology of the formed
man Adam, lf.he bad of taken,
one of the created people, then
Seth would have been a sinner,
and could not have been counted
in the genoology.-God command
ed Thk man Adam and his de
scenders not to eat of the for
bidden fruit. And the forbidden
fruit was the mingling of the
Formed people called the sons
of God with the created people
called Men it was for this reason
tiirtt God sent the flood on the
earth, please read-
" And it came. to pass, whun
men began to multiply on the
face of the earth, and daughters
were born unto them,
That the sons ot God saw th.i
daughters of men that they were
fair; and they took them wives
of all which they chosen.
. And the Lord said,. My spirit
shall not always strive with man
for that.he also is flesh: yet his
days-, shall be an Lundred and
twenty years.
There were giants in the
earth in those days, and also
after that, when the sous of God
came in unto the daughters of
men, and they bare children to
them, the same became mighty
men which we re of o'd. men of
renown.
And God saw that the wicked
ness of man was great in the
earth' and that every imagina
tion of th'3 thoughts of his heart
was only evil continually.
And it repented the Loud that
he had mad ; man on the earth,
and itgrievijd him at his heart,"
Gen 15 1-2 -3-4-5 li)
By this the reader will see
that it was a mi;thty curse for
the sons of God to take the
daughters of men; so if Seth
bad of taken any one of the
daughters of men he would of
been cutoff, out of the family of
the formed man. We must by
this understand that Seth took
bis tistcr to wife, aud this was
even practical in Abraham's
time
This had to be so, in the early
days of the formed peopl", com
mending with The Man Adah
(the Formed man) with the evid
ence that we have given we trust
that this fact will be plain to
our readers, that Seih had to
take his sister to wife
to save
himself from tbe horrible con
demnation which come on those
who per took of tbe accursed
thing, If tbis is not sufficient to
give you the light desired, ask
again.
