Indians Grab Range
Needed By the

That the Navajoes are ' deprivj
ing white settlers pf. lan.ds and.
gtfass needed for their stock is the
gtateme'nt niade by E. 'T. Vogt.of'
Jlamah.j Mr.J VogCis strongly in ''
favor of making the Navajoes ,
Stay on their own reservation, or,
.at least, of making, them ' pay
homesteading and graing fees
ljKe tne wmte settler, r. . ,T.
The Navajo reservation, Mr.
Vogt pointed out, is as big as the
state of Massachusetts and bears
plenty of good grass, but the
Indiana insist on, commg ou(nto
other lands in competition with
.the white settlers. The situation
has actually reached a point', Mr.
Vogt says, where it is working ,a
great hardship oil the' whites. 'x
. The cattlemen's convention
passed wo yorous resolutions
on tne inaian range graDDers.
They were as felldws: .
-r "Whereas, the Navaio Indians
are taking up homesteads and al
