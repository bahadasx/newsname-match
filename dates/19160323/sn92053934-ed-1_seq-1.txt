Laredo. Teas, March 23. Offi
cials of the Carranza government
at Muevo Laredo, today reiterated t
their statement denying the defec
tion of the Torreon garrison to
Villa.
The statement of yesterday that
Luis Herrera, one of the most
loyal Carranza generals, had gone
OTer to Villa with his 2.000 men
caused considerable comment
among officials here today.
San Antonio, Texas, March 23. Or
ders going from Fort Sam Houston to
day provided tor rapid action at var
ious points along the border should
new rebellions in Mexico make it nec
essary. General Funston was not al
together convinced early this morn
ing of the truth of the report that
..General Luis Herrera, the deposed
' military leader at Chihuahua, had en
tered the field with Villa against the
United States, but the repetition of
the story in different places and the
absence of acceptable evidence to the
contrary caused him and his staff to
regard it as probably true.
The imposition of the censorship at
El Paso by General Bell was done
without direct orders from headquar
ters here, but it is known that General
Bell has authority to go far in the
exercise of his own judgment in meet
ing an extraordinary situation.
Staff officers of General Funston
studied a more extended area of north
era Mexico today. The probable moves
of Herrera and his 2,000 men were
carefully considered, and at every
point along the border where they
might disturb the peace of those on
the American side, careful note was
taken of the positions of American
troops and the time it would take to
get them to the scene.
Pershing Forces in Danger!
That phase of the situation did not
alarm the army officers, however, who
believed that if Herrera really has re
volted his activities will be confined
to operations that have for their ob
ject the strengthening of Villa's bands
and the harassing of General Persh
ing's forces. It is feared that one of
hlg earlier moves would be the cut
ting of the Northwestern railway, over
which General Funston hopes to re
ceive permission to move supplies to
the American troops, now almost 200
miles into Mexico. To prevent this
move General Funston is powerless
. and it is doubted if Carranza's troops
are in position to oppose Herrera.

tral Gavira's garrison at Juarez was
about to revolt and that the troops at
Torreon were manifesting disaffection

Rush Relief
to Homeless
in Big Fires
Augusta, Ga., March 23. Twenty
blocks in the residence section of Au
gusta is charred ruins and the bare
walls of six business blocks bear tes
timony today of Augusta's most serious
fire disaster in recent years. Upwards
of 700 houses were destroyed and at
least 3.000 persons are homeless.
The fire which raged for more than
nine hours last night, causing a loss
estimated at from $5,000,000 to $7,000,
000 was brought to a halt early today
after it had crossed Green street.
An area of about one and one-fourth
square miles was ravaged by the
flames which were driven by a heavy
gale. The Augusta firemen were pow
erless and fire apparatus was sent from
Columbia, Charleston, Atlanta, Macon,
Savannah and Waynesboro. Wind sub
sided just after 1 o'clock and it was
not until then that the firemen could
gain in their fight.
Wiped Out Vast Area.
Starting in the Dyer building at the
corner of Eighth and Broad streets,
the fire spread rapidly to "Cotton row"
in the rear, whipped around the Em
pire Life building and then by leaps
and bounds destroyed block after block,
except the 600 square on Broad street.
The flames cut a path from two to
three blocks wide for eight blocks on
Broad street down to east boundary,
the end of the city.
The flames leaped across Broad
street to the south side of Elbert street
and cut their way through to Green
street.
The street railway company, the
telephone company and the electric
lighting company suffered heavy losses
and service was crippled.
Leading citizens of Augusta early to
day began to lay relief plans. City
council met to consider necessary ac
tion and a general mass meeting of
citizens was called.
Officials of the fire department to
day began an investigation into the
cause of the fire.
Organizations Join in Belief.
Nashville, Tenn., March 23 Citi
zens, civic and church"organizations
of Nashville today were caring for 5,
000 persons made homeless by the fire
that swept East Nashville late yester
day, destroying 600 residences, causing
one death and a property loss of $1,
500,000. National guardsmen, called out by
Governor Rye, patroled the burned
area to protect property and prevent
looting.
The one fatality was that of a negro.
Many other persons were injured but
none seriously.
The blaze started from a lighted ball
of yarn thrown into a grassy vacant
lot by a boy. A planing mill first was
destroyed. The flames quickly spread
to an extensive negro settlement,
where, fanned by a high wind, every
house was consumed. The conflagra
tion broke into distinct blazes, one
flowing east on Seventh street and the
other down Fifth avenue. An area of
30 blocks was swept clean which in
cluded many of the costliest residences
of Nashville, several churches and one
charitable institution. After parallel
ing each other on separate streets for
many blocks the two fires again joined.
The fire department worked desper
ately but the gale rendered their ef
forts useless.
Bucket brigades were formed and
tons of water were thus thrown on
buildings at important points in an ef
fort to check or divert the fire. The
flames were finally brought under con
trol. Relief measures were under way he
fore the fire had been extinguished.
Relieving Paris Sufferers.
Paris, Tex., March 23. Work of re
lieving the sufferers and the homeless
in Paris, after the disastrous fire of

The homeless spent last night in the
homes of friends and relatives on
lawns and In such public buildings as
remained.
The greatest task that faced the or

The death list remained today at
three with one person missing.

EI Paso, Texas, March 23 Pancho
Villa has established a base to the
westward of Namiquipa to reorganize
his command and recruit new men
for his army, is a report current here
toda3r. At this new base, it was said,
Villa would lay his plans to cooperate
with the force of General Luis Her
rera, who is understood to have re
nounced the de facto government. The
American army base at Columbus has
had no news of Villa for over two
days. So far General Pershing's forces
have not come In contact with the out
law and his band.
General Luis Herrera is said to be
moving northwestward to effect a
juncture with Villa, and this, in con
nection with the report that the Car
ranza garrison at Torreon had re
volted, has occasioned grave concern
among the American army officers in
El Paso. Villa men, augmented by the
command of General Herrera, said to
number 2,000 well equipped soldiers,
might be in a position to harrass Gen
eral Pershing's army and seriously
interrupt the line of communication
between the advanced base of Amer
ican forces at Casas Grandes and the
main base at Columbus.
Villa Agents Arouse Support.
Villa is said to have sent agents
among the people in the mountain
districts urging them to support him
against the Americans. He is re

arms and ammunition which he has
had caached for some time.
There is no confirmation of a report
that Colonel Cano of Carranza"s ar

House Takes
QuickAction
on Army Bill
"Washington, March 23. Considera-iion-of
the Hay army increase bill was
continued in the house today with only
two Important sections of the measure
still awaiting disposition. One was the
military pay provision under which the
bill is expected to produce a force of
425,000 national guardsmen within five
years as a substitute for the adminis
tration's continental army proposal,
and the other was that providing for
the construction of a nitrate plant.
Prospects were that these provisions
would cause extended debate, but pas
sage of the bill virtually was assured
during the day.
When the house resumed work Rep
resentative Gardner's amendment pro
posing to substitute for the militia pay
provision the volunteer provisions of
the Chamberlain senate bill, was pend
ing.; The Chamberlain bill, doubling the
number of cadets at West Points Mili
tary academy, passed by the senate
late yesterday by a vote of 59 to 2 and
went to the house today.
The provision for drafting was
quickly adopted with little debate.
Representative Gardner of Massachu
setts, however, expressed fear that it
would accomplish little in time of war,
pointing out that during the Civil war
only 46,000 were obtained out of 776,
000 subjected to draft.
On the first vote to strike out the
provision for a government plant to
take nitrogen from the air for man
ufacture of explosives, the motion to
eliminate the project carried, 122 to
100. A record vote was demanded.
The administration plan was shown
by the record vote to be defeated, 154
to 128. This eliminated the entire
provision for securing nitrogen as a
national defense safeguard, designed
to make the country independent of
the supply of nitrates from Chile.

THE WAR TODAY
The Germans have gained a
foothold northwest of Verdun on
the small hill of Hauchourt, after
a vigorous bombardment and an
infantry attack. Northeast of Ver
dun intense artillery lire has
been kept np by the Germans and
a number of infantry attacks have
been made, but the French have
kept them from advancing by the
activity of their big guns.
The French are still clinging to
a part of the little hill of Han
court, southwest of Malancoiirt,
on which the Germans gained a
footing last evening in an attack
along the frcnt between Avocourt
wood and Malancourt, northwest
of Verdun.
The persistence with which the
Germans are pounding the French
positions near Vaux and Daiuloup
indicates that probably they are
preparing for new .attempts to
break through in the sector where
their lines have been pushed near
est to the heart of the stronghold.
In northwestern Russia a battle
is in progress around l'ostav and
the fighting is described as des
parate, with the Russians on the
offensive in most instances. The
German official report declares
that the Russian losses have been
tremendous In the fighting which
is proceeding day and night.
The Russians captured three
lines of trenches from the Ger
mans on the shore of Lake Norocz
where it is declared the battle Is
developing in favor of the Rus
sians. An unofficial report says that
the Austriaus have abandoned
Czernowitz, capital of Bukowina.
Bad weather prevails over the
Italian-Austrian front, but violent
bombardments are kept up by
both sides.
The famous Galloper lightship
at the mouth of the Thames has
been sunk by a torpedo.
Besides striving hard against
German positions along theDvina

Russians are displaying notable
activity In Galicia. The Austrian

Berlin, March 23 (by wireless to
Sayvllle.) The Lokal Anzeiger says
that in view of the progress made
yesterday by German troops near
Avocourt the French line between
Bethincourt and Malancourt is now
menaced. It asserts that the French
positions are threatened from the east
by the German success in the region
of Dead Man's hill and from the west
as a result of the German victory in
the wooded region northeast of Avo
court. The newspaper points out that the
town of Avocourt is only seven kilo
metres from the important Verdun
Paris railroad, the intervening dis
tance being covered with woods and
hills.
Carl Rosner, the correspondent on
the Verdun front of the Lokal An
zeiger, telegraphs that the German
success in the forests of Avocourt and
Malancourt places he French north
western positions of Malancourt and
Bethincourt in a precarious situation
because they bulge into the German
lines, exposing the communications to
