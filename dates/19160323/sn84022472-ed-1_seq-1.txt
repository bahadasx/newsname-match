GAELIC FOOTBALL
CLUB COMPLIES
WITH REFORMS
Remonstrance Against Li
cense For Club' Not Likely
To Be Pressed.
No Charce that the Brideennrt
Gaelic Football club is. not a bona
fide organization was made this
morning when thehearing on
remonstrance against the . club's ap,
plication for a , liquor license was
beard before the- county commission
ers. It is alleged by the club mem
bers. that - representatives of the
Bridgeport Pastors' association; who
tiled the remonstrance, had suggest-
jbo -certain changes in " the ttlub's
methods of keeping records. All these
suggestions were adopted at a re
cent meeting and the members - de
clared this morning that 'there wasno
further ground for remonstrance.
T. H. Sullivan, a former club, of
ficial, said there had never been (any
complaint about noise from the or
ganization's quarters. He said there
v. ere meetings held twice a month
and that the membership at present ia
about .70. ,
He said members gathered at the
club other nights of the week as well
as Sundays and although there ' is a
bar this was nthe sole reason for
the club's existence. The club . had
been nourishing since 1903 and always
put' a football team In the field.
Edward Brosnan, secretary of the
club, produced the books to show the
revenue received from dues. . He said
the club held an , annual ball and
monthly socials from which a small
amount of profit was' deposited in the
club funds and did not go-to any in
dividual, -the witness claimed. He,
testified that nobody but a member
could enter theclub rooms at-105J
Middle street' and ' that unless a man
had a book showing his dues "were
paid he would not be avowed to buy
any liquor. '
' Patrick Sullivan, formerly Demo
cratic, cfhairman of the Second district,
said he had once been president of
the Gaelic club and was an active
member of the organization. He re
peated the statement that a man must
have a member's book to enter the
ulubrooms and no liquor would be
furnished to outsiders. He explained
that many of the members did not
drink and that the bar was not the
sole support of the club. '

uftipn last night the proposition of
building a labor temple : in Bridgeport
was discussed. . It is proposed such a

quarters for all organizations her
that are affiliated with the' American
Federation of : Labor. The plan dis
cussed provides for a tig assembly-
hall for public meetings as well' as
smaller halls for meeting of the vari
ous labor bodies. .
The plan does not meet with the ap
proval of the older unions, , however,
because they carry large balances in
their treasuries and their members
feel they would have to stand the
brunt of expense for a building which
the members of the newer unions who
have no funds would equally . enjoy.
There was a very spirited discussion
of the matter but no action was taken.
There is a movement on foot among

was that providing Tor the construc

were that these provisions would cause
