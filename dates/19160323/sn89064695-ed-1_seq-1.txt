to be a friend of fair and honest dealing with the American Indians.
Senator Reed, of Missouri, is the friend of the Indian interests
which the Osage controversies has developed, and his aim is to secure
only proper and honest treatment for the interests of a people who
are entirely at the mercj' of comparatively a stmll coterie of men.
The Osage delegates now at Washington and their attorneys, who
have spent the winter there ir. an effort to prevent the Interior De
partment from disposing of the oil and gas prhileges of the Osage
reservation in Oklahoma, which might be unfair to the Osage Indians,
have relied largely upon Senator Reed to protect the interests of the
Indian*, and knowing that he is in sympathy with what is right al
ways, and is a forciful man who, when he has decided" upon what
right and proper, will not hesitate to try and enforce his views, place
implicit confidence in him.
The Osage delegates, who are also members of the Osage council,
who have been at Washington all winter, have been profuse in their
expressions of gratitude towards Senator Reed when ever conversing
with the members of other Indian delegations, for the valuable assist-
ance he has rendered them.
The Congressional Directory states that Senator Reed is a Demo-
crat, of Kansas City, Mo., was born November 9, 1S61, near Mans-
fi Id, Richland County, Ohio, moved to Kansas City in 1S87 is a law-
yer and was admitted to the bar in 1S85 elected to the United States
Senate to succeed Maj. William Warner, Republican, for a tem be-

his not hesitat
ed to say Howard was not only
untruthful but dishonest, and that
he violated United States la-vs by
committing offences for wlreh the
government has caused many men
to be arrewted and prosecuted.
John Howard has been a most
disturbing factor upon this reser
vation, not because he had any in
fluence personally with the mem
bers of the reservation, but be
cause his position of superintend-

ent enabled him to do so. It be
came a mania with him to make
misrepresentations to the Indian
ofiice at Washington against mem
bers of this reiervati.m who e
longed to the faction which wbs
opposed to him, or who refused to
bow submi-shely to the imposi-
tion'-, frauds and miMVpresenta
tions which he practiced upon
them.
II. lliiiton, formerly special
Indian agenr,
who assisted M. C.
Burch, has been appointed to suc
ceed Howard, and while the pie
judices he formed here while with
the Burch force might not be so
strong as to cause him to continue
the Howard tactics, the prejudices
auainst him may be hard to over
come even if this cm bts done.
Mr. Hinton's appointm lit a
cided disappointment to the pm
yressive element, of this reserva
tion. When Secretary Linecausi-d
him to recalled from this r. j-ei
v.iiion las* summer it was imp.
that like tne otlmr members ot dm
Burch loice he had disapp. aied
entirely fiom here so far t least,
as Chippewa matters are con
cerned.
From reliible MHIICCS it is learia
that the Indian ofiice at Washing
ton will not tol rate uny inclina
tion towards partiality in favor of
one faction upon this reservation
as against the other by any super
intendent that whoever is placed
here in charge of this reservation
must make no distinction in his
official treatment of aay of the
m&mbora of the reservation. We
will hope that this is true.
