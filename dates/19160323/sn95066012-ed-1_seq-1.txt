WHY GUNS JAMMED
Rapld-Flrers Could Not Be Loaded In
the Darkness.
Washington,' March 22. An official
report , explaining that difficulty of
loading in darkness was - responsible
for the failure of two of the four
weapons of the 13th cavalry's machine
gun troops in the fight with Villa and
his bandits at Columbus, has been re
ceived at the war department. Press
dispatches tolling of the guns jamming
had caused Brig-Gen. Crozier, chief of
ordnance, t order, an' investigation.
The report transmitted by the of
ficer commanding trie machine-gun
troop through the headquarters of the
San Antonio arsenal, follows:
"The reason for the jamming of the
machine-guns during the fight last
Thursday morning was not the failure
of the mechanism to function proper
ly, but the (act that the night was
dark and it was a very difficult mat
ter to load the guns.' In loading the
guns the feed strip has to be Inserted
properly in this, 'guide. If the strip
is not inserted properly In this guide
the gun will fire about five shots and
will then jam. This happened to two
of my guns, as it was so dark that It
was almost impossible to get the strips
in the slots. The other two guns did
not jam and the execution they did
showed the value of machine-gun Ore
The ammunition used was not reloaded
and had been manufactured since 1910
The extractors are all model 1914.
Gen. Crozier appeared to regard the
explanation as satisfactory, as . the
troopers Were fighting under the most
adverse conditions.

FIGHTING IN DVINSK REGION
Russians Taking of Advantage
of
German Activity at Verdun.
Petrograd, March 22, The Russian
operations on the northern front
promises to develop into the most
e ' ''8 movement undertaken by
'V. '" in this theatre of war since
tic te f ' von Hindenberg's cam
paign ... "fbra 4,,sk last autumn.
Taking k ' German pre-oc-
cupation at Ve. .Russian Btaff
decided to antlcip-M iiy plans the
Germans might be making tor an of
fensive in the Dvlnsk region by a ser
ies of maneuvres which, if successful
would not only make it impossible for
them to institute the advance they
apparently intended, but also force
them out of the positions they now
hold against the Northern Hussian
Army.
The position of the German forces
in the northern section takes the form
of an arc, with the army before
Dvlnsk occupying the point in the arc
furthest extended into Russian terri
tory. This alignment makes the Ger
man position particularly susceptible
to flanking attacks by the Russians
north and south of Dvlnsk. These, as
officially announced, have already be
gun. In the region of Lake Narooz, south
of Dvlnsk, the Russians advanced
along a ten-mile front, threatening the
Vilua Railroad and German communi
cations between this point and Dvinsk
It Is unofficially reported that this
movement against the southern flank
of the German Dvinsk position was ac
companied by maneuvers of the same
nature against the northern German
flank in the neighborhood of Friedrich
stadc. The effect of these two attacks, if
successfully executed, will be to
squeeze the Germans from their ex
tended position before Dvlnsk and
convert the present arc into a straight
line from Frieilrichstadt to Svientsy
any. Y. M. C. A. SOCIAL
Third of Series Shows Increasing
Popularity.
Last evening 150 young people as
sembled at the Y. M. C. A. This is,
so far as it is possible to count ac
curately an increased attendance of
35 over the laBt social in February.
And they camo early, many arriving
hefore eight o'clock, t .
The program was ' practically the
same as heretofore, including games,
dancing and refreshments. Of late
checkers and chess have become quite
popular at the "Y", aud last night
there were not boards enough to meet
the demand. In fact, the building and
equipment were taxed about to capaci
ty. ... . .
No simple task falls to the social
committee to keep things going, and
instructing the ladies In the different
games, and the work of this . commit
tee was everywhere in evidence, under
the direction of William. H. Cone, who
has just assumed the chairmanship.
Many- thought the blizzard advertised
tor today had got ahead of itself when
showers of confetti were released up
on the dancers from the clouds in the
gym. ?
There was a liberal sprinkling of
parents throughout the building. The
patronesses were Mrs. W. B. Sheldon,
who Is the newly elected president of.

G. S. Mills, Mrs. L. H. Ross, Mrs. E.
L. Hunter, Mrs. L. II. Royce, Miss

FORCE ECONOMY ON YOUTHS
German Authorities Order Them to
Deposit Their Earnings.
Berlin, March 20, (by Wireless to
Sayvllle.) An official decree was is
sued today to the effect that minors
engaged in gainful occupations shall
not receive more than 18 marks week
ly of their earnings, together with a
surplus amounting to not more than
one-third of the amount paid in excess
of 18 marks. The residue must be de
posited in savings banks, not to be
withdrawn during the war.
This -measure was decided upon ow
ing to the fact that exceptionally high
salaries are being paid and that in
seme instances the money has been
wasted because the lathers or guard
ians of the minors, being at the front,
are unable to exercise proper super
vision. LOSS OF 2,000 VESSELS

Chief.
El Paso, Tex., March 23. All re
ports today indicated that the United
States had taken over the Mexican
railroad, with the consent of the de
facto government, In order to trans
port provisions and supplies to the
expedition under Gen. Pershing. How
this consent was obtained Is not
known outside of army circles.
The problem of transporting sup
plies by auto truck over 200 miles of
desert has been found impracticable.
Washington," March 23. Grave ap
prehension regarding the outcome of
the American expedition into Mexico
in pursuit of Villa was evident for tho
first timo last night, after receipt by
the war department of a dispatch
from Gen. F-unslon saying a report had
reached him that 2000 Carranza troops
at Chihuahua, under Gen. Louis Her
rera, had revolted and aligned them
selves with the bandit chief. Gen.
Funston did not disclose tho source of
his information and, bo far as coijld
be loamed, no confirmation had reach
ed the state department or the Mexi
can embassy. Fear that tho report
might be true was not disguised in of
ficial circles, however, and last night's
developments were awaited with tense
anxiety. f
If Herrera and his troops have join
ed Villa, some officials believe "other
Carranza commanders and troops may
quickly follow their example. In such
an event, the United States and do
facto government of Mexico"." would
find themselves confronted with a seri
ous situation. A large part of the
forces of the :defacto government -in
northern Mo.fW formerly were Villa
soldiers -'and with : Ihelr officers, have
follow ed'tlie-'bandit chieftain. to manj
hard-fdught victories. ,
TheUrdops under Herrera are de
scribed; as being probably the best
equipped 'in northern Mexico and they
are said' to be well supplied with am
munition. Louis Herrera at one, time
was ririe of Villa's most active aids, as
was bis brother, Maciovio, who now is
belioved fo be operating in the state
of Coahuila with a considerable force.
Rumors concerning the doubtful, in
tentions of the Arrieta brothers, lead
in a force in Durango, also have tend
ed to increase disqulto at Washington.
Rebellion in Carranza'a army would
render the position of the American
expeditionary force so perilous that
every available soldier would be
rushed in to reinforce the advancing
columns. For this purpose not more
than about la.tmO men would he avail
able without calling out tho national
guard. There are now on the border
or in Mexico about 25,000 soldiers,
and in tho whole of the continental
United States the other mobile forces
number only a little more than 5000. -
Before the Funstcn teport arrived
Counselor Polk of the state depart
ment and Ell:;eo Arredondo, tho Mex
ican embassador designate, had com
pleted the draft of the protocol asked
for by Gen Carranza to govern the
operations of tho American forces in
Mexico and provide for co-operation
by the troops of the defacto govern
ment. Mr. Polk and Mr. Arredondo
were in entire accord on the terms of
tho proposed convention and the lat
ter dispatched it to Gen Carranza,
with the recommendation that it be
approved. It is to become effective
immediately upon being signed.

FATHERS AND SONS
Old Y. M. C. A. Function
First Time
Here Fo
ith the object In view of bringing
about a closer relationship between
fathers and sons, the association will
hold a Father and Sou Supper Wednes
day evening, March 29th, at quarter of
seven.
This is not a new idea, although new
to Bennington, but it is one of the hap
piest ideas which the association has
struck, and these banquets are now
held the country' over.
First will come an excellent supper, i
to be served by the ladies' Auxiliary of
the Y. M. C. A. The menu has no rela
tion to the price, as it Is the wish that
no father and son shall remain at home
'because of the cost. A nominal charge
of twenty-five cents per plate will be
made, but the supper in itself will re
pay those who attend. There will be
orchestral musiq to add to the enjoy
ment of the supper.
The key-note cf the evening will be
struck by A. J. Pierce, boys' work sec
retary of the Troy V. M. C. A. The
president and secretary of the local as
sociation went to Pittsfleld recently to
hear Mr. Pierce, and were so impressed
with the importance ot his message
that he was signed up on the spot for
the coming occasion. Mr. Pierce speaks
to fathers of all creeds about the prac
tical, essential needs of boys, and his
audience files out quietly, thoughtfully,
determined.
There will also be present the state
Y. M. C. A. secretary, Bryon N. Clark,
of Burlington, who will speak briefly,
't is the custom to hear from each
a father and a son, and Roger Burt and
A. W. Braisted have consented to speak
from their points of view. Ray Pad
dock will act as toastmaster.
Each father will receive an appro
priate souvenir of the occasion.
All fathers, with sons between
twelve and twenty-one, are cordially,
whether members of the Y. M. C. A. or
not, so far as they can be accommo
dated. The ladies wish to know o i 'r
before Saturday of this week how
many will attend. There are at pr?
sent seventy-five plates asked for and it
is feared that all who may wish to go
cannot be accommodated. Telephone,
write or call at the Y. M. C. A. at once
l'or reservations.
COLE YOUNGER DEAD
Was the Last of a Famous Gang
Bandits,
of
Lees Summit, Mo., March 21. Colo
Younger, notorious outlaw of border
days, but of lato years a devout church
attendant and peaceful citizen, died at
his home here tonight after a linger
ing illness. He was 72 years of age
and unmarried.
. Cole Younger was one of the last
members of the notorious robber bands
that Infested western Missouri during
and after the Civil war. Ha was a
member of the Quantrell band of
guerrillas and' with his two brothers
took part with the "James boys" in
bank and train robberies in Missouri
and neighboring states that netted the
looters more than a hundred thousand
dollars. The 'leading members ol
these bands are dead,' some at the
hands of the law, some by suicide and
others from natural causes; Younger
after a long term in the penitentiary
became a law abiding Missouri citizen
Cole was the oldest of the three
"Younger boys."
The father. Col. Harry W. Younger
came to Missouri from Kentucky be
fore the war. He was a strong unior
man, though a slaveholder. He settled
near Lees Summit, 20 miles from Kan
sas City, where Cole was born in 1844
Colonel Younger was murdered by one
of the bands of lawless guerrillas that
infested tho Missouri-Kansas border in
war times. Tho sens suid their father
was slain by Kansans for the purposr
of robbery. They immediately took ur
arms against the north. They joined
QuantreU's guerrillas and had their
part in the memorable sacking of
Lawrence, Kansas.
.Many sensational, robberies for
which the Younger and James boys
were blamed were carried out suc
cessively before the three Younger
brothers were captured in Minnesota
after a. raid on a bank at Northneld
Minn., in 1876, in the course of which
Cashier Haywood was killed. Thr
Youngers were shot many times ir
battles with a posse, but finally worr
taken alive after a battle at Shields
villc. Minn.
Cole and his brothers pleaded guilty
and were sentenced to prison for life
They entered the penitentiary at Still
water, Minn., and became model pris
oners. Bob died in the penitentiary in
1889. Cole and James Younger wore
paroled in 1001. The next year Jnmee
shot himself, leaving a note ascribing
his action to a refusal of the parole
board to permit him to marry the
girl he loved.
After Cole was paroled he war
forced by Minnesota law to live in that
state for three years. Then ho re
turned to Missouri and settled down
in a vino covered cottage, . which he
bought for a niece In Lees Summit
the scene of his boyhood days. For a
time he was connected with a show
and later went on the lecture platform,
and became a good citizen.
In August, 1913, Younger wns con
verted to religion at a revival meeting
and became an active church worker
"I've led nn adventurous, turbulent
life," he said. "The war brought on
hate and strife and killing around here
I have been blamed for a lot of it with
which I had nothing to do. ..They mur
dered my father and I was launched
Into a life cf shooting and reprisal
and rough riding, winding up with 25
years in tho penitentiary. I was
brought up in a Christian home. Now
I'm an old man and I've come by Gnd's
mercy back to the place of my child
hood to end my days."
