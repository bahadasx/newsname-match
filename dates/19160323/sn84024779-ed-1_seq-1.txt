NEW BRICK BLOCKS
FOR BRECKENFIDGE
A New Federal Building Is In
Sight and Louis Gewalt to
Erect New Building
PROPERTY CHANGES HANDS
And Mrs. Emma Hoppe is Serious
iy Considering Ereeting New
Brick Block on Her Lots
Word comes to us that the bill
introduced by Congressman Steen
erxon of that district of Minne
sota some tine ago, appropriating
the sum of $50,000 for a Federal
tuilding in this city, is certain to
become a law at this session 01
Congress.
I'll is will be about the best
news lircckcnridgc citizens have
heard in a long time, and will give
tliern a public building that has
been badly needed for a long
time.
Discussing the loca'ion of such
a building, one of Mrcckenridge's
j)i'iuii.icut business .nen suggest
ed that, the lots purchased some
time ago by the city, at the.: cor
ner of Fifth street and Nebraska
\tnue. would be a«i ideai loca
tion, and we. heartily agree with
I'iin This is the most central lo
cation that could |),. four.d, and
would accomodate more? peop!
I ban any other locuton in Mi
city. Another local ion suggested
is the one at Sixth and Nebraska,
jus| south of !11• Rapt.isl church.
Louis iewalI, the pioneer liard
wareinan of Mrcckcnridgc, is
making prepai'iitions to remodel
his building on Minnesota avenue
ofrmerly occupied |y he Bismarck
saloon. A new front will be put
in and the huhling modernized in
other ways. When all is complet
ed his hardware stock will be
moved in.
When this is done the building
on Fifth street which he occupies
at present, will be torn down, and
a handsome brick structure, 4 4
80 feet, will be erected. This
bidding will he built over a fu:l
basement and will have workshop
and store house the rear, als
of brick, and will make one of the
handsomcat hardware stores in
any of the smaller towns of the
stale or adjoining states.
Humor has it that Mrs. Emma
Hoppe is seriously considering
the erection of a two story brick
block on her lots on the corner of
fifth street and Minnesota avenu".
If erected the building will he
divided into store rooms on the
lirsl floor and i.nto office suites
ill the second.
This corner is without doubt,
he be at on in he it
and if Mrs. Iluppe conclude:-
II res as soon

PAPER SHORTAGE TO BRING

The shortage of paper caused
by the war may lead to the re
introduction of the banished
school slate, or a specially pre
pared hoard substitute. The hy

sertion that with proper safe
guards, such as the insistence up
on the use of the sponge anil the
retention by each child of its own
