Warring Country.
Washington, .March 22—Grave ap­
prehension of the outcome ol' the
American expedition into Mexico in
tho pursuit of Villa was evidenced for
the first time in Washington tonight,
after receipt by the war department
of,a dispa'.ch from General Punston,
saying a report liad reached him that
2,000 Carranza troops at Chihuahua,
under General Huis Muerria, had re­
volted and aligned themselves with
the bandit chief. General Funston
did not. disclose the source of hjs in­
formation, arid- BO fiir :IH coiilci^ lie
learned, on confirmation had reached
the state department or the Mexican
embassy. Fear that the report might
Up trite was not disguised in official
circles, and tonight's developments
were awaited with intense anxiety.
Other Generals Mav Follow.
If lliierria and his troops have join­
ed Villa, some officials believe other
Carranza generals and troops may
(illicitly follow their example. In such
an event, the United Stall's and tin
de facto government of Mexico will
find themselves confronted with a sit­
uation so Serious thai its possibilities
hardly can be estimated. A large part
of the forces of the tie facto govern­
ment in northern Mexico formerly
were Villa soldiers and with their offi­
cers have followed I he bandit chief
tan to many hard fought victories.
Hardship Story.
The lirst story of the hardships suf­
fered by the American soldiers in
their now famous inarch across the
Chihuahua desert was told here to­
night by Sargent W. P. Harrison, of
1he I3th Cavalry from EI I'aso. Sar­
gent Harrison told his story propped
up in bed in the hospital, where ho
was taken on his arrival here, suffer­
ing from dysentery.
No Cheering.
"We went in first," he said. "There
was no cheering. That stuff is bunk.
Everybody was serious and not much
was said. We all started off at a
brisk trot and at once the dust be­
gan to rise. There wasn't a breath
of air, and the dust hung over the
roads like a curtain.
Men Half Blinded.
"The alkali got into our eyes and
down our throats it sifted into our
shoes and into our clothes. The sun
bored down into our skulls. We put
wet handkerchiefs in our hats, but it
did not help much. Most of the fol­
lowers rode along with their eyes
shut to keep out of the dust and glare.
Many of the men were half-blinded by
noon.
Dust Hurt Eyes.
"My eyes began to itch soon around
the edges, then they felt as big as
camp kettles, and everything got dark.
You could feel the blood beating back
of your eyeballs. Then the headache
Looked Like Indians.
'You should have seen the faces of
the men after an hour or two. The
dust settled on the sweat and then
the sweat would run down, leaving a
little furrow. Some of them looked
like painted Indians.
"When we got to Las Palomas we
went right through the streets. There
wasn't a soul in the whole town. It
was wierd. We hoard some ducks
quacking and saw some goats, but
not a human being. At the next
town, Boca Brandes, there were three
peons sitting in the sun. The rest of
the place was like a grave. Only you
expect a grave to be silent but when
a town is silent that way, it is funny.
Found Dead Cowboy.
"Just outside of Boca Grandes we
found the body of a cowboy, who had
been killed by Villa on his way to
Colntnhus.
'The body, la.y ahout 20. fenl from
Ihe road. They had tortured him and
Ms hands were burned to a crisp.
We did not have time to bury the

El Paso, .Mar'^h 22.—General George

General Bell said he did not intend

FACTIONAL CONTESTS
FEATURED MEETING
Oklahoma, City, March ^.--Begin­
ning as a love feast, with Ihe elec­
tion of .lohn Fields of Oklahoma. Cil.v
as chairman, the republican state con­
vention today developed a series of
factional contests between supporters
of .lames |W. Harris of Wlagouer and
.1. .1. McG-raw of I'onca City, rival can­
didates for the position of national
committeeman, which, after several
turbulent hours, culminated in Ihe re­
fusal of Harris' friends let present his
name to the convention. They an­
nounced in a formal protest that they
would contest the election of a na­
tional committeeman before the re­
publican national convention, but they
had no intention of "bolting."
McGraw was elected national com­
mitteeman by a large majority.
Wild Disorder Prevailed.
Discussion of the report of the cre­
dentials committee in the state com­
mittee evoked wild disorder and sev­
eral fistic battles here tate today. The
report advocated seating two rival
delegations from Muskogee. Police
quelled the belligerent delegates and
an "old soldier" fife and drum corps
helped divert the attention until quiet
was restored.
Blake Still Unconscious.
Ernest Blake of Oklahoma City and
Alva McDonald of El .Reno had a per­
sonal encounter during the state com­
mittee hearing on contested delegates
earlier in the day, and it was an­
nounced late today that Blake was
in,a critical condition. He was con­
scious only at intervals during the
day, it was said.

TO DIPLOMATIC WORLD
Pekin, March 22.—A state depart­
ment mandate isued tonight announc­
es the abandonment ol the monarchy
and resumption of the republic.
The imperial document, the man­
date adds, will be returned by Yuan
Shi Kai to the state consul, which
wvill reconvene as the senate, pre­
paratory to the resumption of the re­
public.
Hau Shi Chang, who 1

ment, signed the mandate as secre­
tary of state, having re-entered the
cabinet.
Yuan Shi Kai's Downfall.
In the downfall of Yuan Shi Kai's
plans for making himself emperor,
hope is seen in official and diplomatic
circles for an early restoration of
peace in China, and maintenance of
the status quo in the Far East during
the European war.
Press dispatches announcing the
abandonment of the proposed mon­
archy occasioned no surprise, al­
though there had been no reports of
the action either to the state deoart
ment or the Chinese legion, and re­
cent official dispatches had not indi­
cated the step was imminent. The
Province of Yunnan, rebeling against
the overthrow of the republic, for
months has been maintaining its
maintenance ofthe independent gov­
ernment, and reports of revolts have
come thick and f:»st. from the south­
ern district. In addition lo this state
of affairs at home. Yuan has faced op­
position to his nlans from the outside.
Great Britain. Japan and Russia have
put forth pressure to prevent any
change at this time.

AUGUSTA, GEORGIA
LOSS TWO MILLION
Boy Threw Ball of Yarn Into the
Grass and Caused Heavy
Damage to City.
Augusta, Ga.. March 22.—iFire
which broke out early tonight in the
business section of Augusta, caused
damage estimated at a half million
dollars at 9 o'clock, and still was
spreading before a high wind.
The Lyre bank building was among
the structures totally destroyed, and
the Union bank building, the West­
ern Union building, and the building
bousing the Augusta Chronicle and
Augusta Herald were among those
damaged. Fire companies with equip­
ment were rushed here on special
trains from Macon and Atalanta.
The damage is estimated at more
than 2,000,000 in the downtown sec­
tion, and at a late hour was eating
its way unchecked down Broad street,
where the city's principal business
houses are located. Ten blocks had
been destroyed or were burning and
the flames were threatening to spread
to the residntial section. Shortly be­
fore midnight the (lames were car
tied by the wind into the residential
'section, where a new conflagration
was soon making headway. Thfc out
break was a distance of four blocks
from the blaze in the business sev
ion.
Fear was expressed that, there had
been loss of life in the Lyre build­
ing, where the blaze started, but it
was impossible lo learn definitely,
Buildings along I'.'road and Jackson
streets burst into Haines at il:•'"
o'clock tonight.
"Cotton row," where $ri,il00,iil)0
worth of col Ion was stored, seemed
doomed.
Soon after midnight. Ihe lire ap­
peared lo have burned' itself out.
Oil Field On Fire.
Telegraphic reports from Tulsa,
Okla., say a prairie lire, started by
burning waste oil and which burned
over four sections of land in the heart
of the Cushing oil Held last night an I
this morning, was under control Ibis
afternoon, although several tanks of
oil still were burning. Fifty-live rigs,
twU'score tanks of oil, Iranging in
size from 2.10 to IlillO barrels, tilled
with oil, one rr,i)00-barrel tank, par­
tially tilled, two school |houses, sev­
eral bunk houses, one pumping sta­
tion and one boiler house were de­
stroyed tonight. The actual property
loss was estimated tonight at $200,
M'iO, although loss through shut ling
in of nearly 100 wells will increase
this figure.
•Undergrowth in Ihe entire field is
as dry as tinder over ground soaked
with inflammable oil. The condition
of the high wind that was blowing to­
night. makes the situation one of con­
siderable danger.
Nashville Loses $1,500,000.
A ball of yarn lighted and thrown
by a boy into dry grass in a vacant
lot started a conflagration in Nash­
ville at noon today,
Avhich
was not
under control until late this after,
noon, after 35 residence blocks had
been swept by the lire. The loss is
estimated at $1,500,000.
A twisting, coiling wind driving at
50 miles an hour fanned the burning
grass into a torrent of flames, which
quickly caught a planing mill and
leaped from building to building un­
til at least 600 residences had been
destroyed. The East Nashville sub
postoffice, the big Warner public
school was burned down and several
churches were reduced to ruins.
Three Thousand Homeless.
Tonight it is estimated that at
least 3,000 persons are homeless as
a result of the conflagration.
National Guardsmen, called out by
Gov. Rye, went on duty in the fire
zone late this afternoon and will re­
main there for several days to aid
in relief work and to prevent looting.

LaFollette is running ahead of Bs«

The Wisconsin senator has been en­

Olson is Safe.
Gunder Olson of Grafton has a com­
fortable lead over Lemke, the totals
being in 473 precincts: Olson, 6,317,
and Lemke, 4,057. Much Olsor. terri­
tory has still to be heard from and
the former slate treasurer should in­
crease his lead materially.
Claude C. Turner of Dickinson and
C. B. Little of Bismarck are crowd­
ing each oilier for high man on the
delegate list. A majority of the 473
precincts heard from are in the Red
River valley. The best territory for
the Slope men on the delegation has
still to be heard from. These re­
turns may save 'Smith-Petersen, Hom­
nes and Kretschmar, the three men
who ran below tenth on the ticket
selected by the state central commit­
tee.
Slope May Change I.
On the face of the 473 precincts,
four delegates named by the Progres­
sive league are among the ten: 'Burt­
ness, Grand Forks Euohanan, Bu­
chanan Pollock, Fargo, and Mr. 'P.
Johnson, Tolley. Returns from the
Slope, however, are being counted up­
on to reduce or overcome the lead
of these men.
Perry-Bruegger Fight.
The Perry-Bruegger fight is far
from settled yet. In 611 precincts.
Perry has a lead of only 211 over
Bruegger. Much Bruegger and Perry
