WHY NOT A "CLEAN-UP DAY" FOR
BEAVER?
We note from our exchonges that
most of tlio lire, lle-awiike towns are
inaugurating "Clean-Up" days and tho
citizens are taking a lively Interest In
making their homo grounds and the
town In general a cleaner and more
beautiful place In which to live. Why
can't Beaver do something along this
Hue? All citizens, at all times, should
be interested in keeping the town
clean and their homes attractive, but
unfortunately there are those who
eem to take more delight in littering
up their own premises and allowing
their trash and waste to be blown and
scattered to adjoining property, than
in taking care to prevent anything of
the kind. Even a 'Clean-Up" day
would probably fall to Interest such
an Individual but it would mako his
carelessness all the more noticeable
were the premises of thosu about him
kept clean, und it might cause him,
from a sense 01 shame if not of pride,
to clean up a hit. The alleys of lien
vei1, particularly, are unsightly and
filthy and the waste from them is
carried by the high winds Into our
yards and to our very doorsteps. If
this rubbisli were collected and burn
ed before the windy days come, tho
appearance of our town would bo
Improved 100 per cent. Why not
observe such a day in Beaver? Won't
somo live, public-spirited citizen take
hold of the project and inject some
interest and enthusiasm into it?
UNPARDONABLE CARELESSNESS.
Tuesday tro ning when the wind was
at its height we stood at our ollice door
and noticed a prominent business man
of Beaver sweep out a basket full of
scrap paper and let it scatter tu the
four winds. Wo dld'nt say who it was
Such carelessness is almost unpardon
able. If anybody should take a pride
in making the towm In which they
aredcing bustnoss, attractive and pre
sentable, it ought to bo the business
people themselves and yet we'll ven
ture that more than one establish
ment carelessly Sweeps trash and
paper into the Btreet or alley. Why
don't Beaver wake up and clean up?
Our town never looked aB ragged and
dirty af it does this Spring. Can't we
do something to imprurn its appear
ance? Other towns are having "Clean
Up Day " Why not Bcavor? The
first week in April, say about the 7th,
would bo a good time to observe
"Clean Up Day " Won't some good
live booster take hold of the proposi
tion and got the city dads to designate
the day as a holiday and everybody
get out and literally clean up the
town? Who'll volunteer?

UNUSUAL INTEREST SHOWN AT

The republican county convention,
held at the Court House, Saturday

delegates to the state convention nml
the transaction of other business, was
attended by n much larger represen
tation than for several years past and
an unusual interest was manifested
on all sloes. If tho convention can be
taken as any indication It looks like
Beaver county republicans feel the
need of greater interest In the political
attain of our county and state and
they are waking up tu their duty
The meeting was extremely harmoni
ous aud tho business was transacted

WORK ON THE STREETS COMMENCED.
Some good work has been dune on
the streets tho past week and It Is to
be hoped that It will continue until all
our streets are put In a first ulass con
ditlnn. The heavy tralllc all fall ana
winter has rendered the streets almost
impassible and it is going to take a lot
of work to get them in shape but the
town can't afford not to do It. There
is perhaps no greater drawback to a
town than to have tho streets In such a
condition that it Is almost Impossible
to travel over them. People coming
into town to trade and strangers
coming to locate lo k at the condi
tion of our streets and, we fear, often
form a poor opinion of the placo on
account of the dilapidated condition of
our thoroughfares. We realize as
much us anyone that everything can't
be done at once and that the changed
conditions in Beaver have to bemet
gradually but It seems to us that it is
time now to turn our attention to town
improvement if we expect to hold the
prestige that we have gained by the
new order of things. ,
QUALITY is the predominating
feature of every suit made-to-measure

ANOTHER SHALL BLAZE.
During the high wind Tuesday an
alarm of tire was given and all who
heard it were seized with terror for a
lire in such a gafe as was prevailing
looked mighty serious. It developed
however that the blaze was not as
serious as it might have been and that
the lire was only in some trash aud
feed at Herchul Wright's barn yard
It was gotten under control before any
damage was done.
The day before had been calm and
Herchel had taken advantage the
absence of wind to burn some, trash
about his premises. It was thuught
that the lire had all died out but the
high wind Tuesday fanned into a blaze
and by the time it was discovered it
was spreading rapidly vnd would toon
have reached the barn nearby. It just
happened that the delivery wagon
from Moore k Company's, was passing
and Mr. Moore discovered the lire and
gave the alarm. It didn't take long to
get most ot the inhabitants of Beaver
on the scene and with the help of the
bucket brigade before the arrival of
the hose cart, the fire was soon gotten
under control.
