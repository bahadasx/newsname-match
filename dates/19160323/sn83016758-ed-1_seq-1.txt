$69,000 FOR ROADS
That Amount Will be Expended for
Roads in Mille Lacs Coun-
ty This Year.
Towns Hare Voted Very Liberal Sums
for Roads at Annual Town
Meeting This Year.
There ought to be some good road
work done in Mille Lacs county this
year. The total amount available for
road work, after making due allow
ance for delinquent taxes, will be inMonday
the neighborhood of $69,000, Last
year the towns and villages of the
county voted $41,316, the county com
missioners levied $12,500, and the
state apportionment for this year is
$15,500, making a total of $69,316.
Taxes levied last year are due and
collectible this year, and the state ap
portionment is available in the year
for which it is made.
Here are the amounts voted and
levied by the several towns and vil
lages last year:
Bogus Brook $3,000
Borgholm 2,000
Dailey 1,600
Eastside 829
Greenbush .s 3,189
Hayland 1,650
Kathio 1,000
Isle Village 744
Isle Harbor 5,169
Milo 2,500
Milaca 1,200
Milaca Village 2,000
Mudgett 1,435
Onamia Village 900
Onamia 2,600
Page 2,000
Princeton 2,500
Princeton Village 6,000
South Harbor 1,000
Total $41,316
In addition to the above the town
of Onamia levied a special five mill
emergency tax.
If the money is judiciously expended
there should be good results therefrom
we should have a considerably in
creased mileage of permanently im
proved roads to show for it at the end
of the year.
The amounts voted for roads and
bridges this year by the towns at the
^_ annual town meeting, and which will
~~~be available next year is as follows:
Bogus Brook
Borgholm Dailey Eastside Greenbush

Total $34,250
Next year it is safe to assume that
the amount levied by the county and
the state apportionment will be larger
than it is this year.
If the amounts voted and appropri
ated for roads and bridges are proper
ly expended, within the next few years
we ought to have a system of fairly
good roads in Mille Lacs county.

the assembly room. The chemical cab
inet contained chemicals, acids, ben
zine, gasoline and other well known
heat generators. The cabinet is made
of wood, and is not properly lined, con
sequently the above arrangement is
extremely unsafe.
Mr. Jordan informed a Union re
porter that a complete and detailed re
port would be filed with his office, and
some changes may be ordered.
Mrs. Phoebe M. Soule.
Mrs. Phoebe M. Soule, an esteemed
Princeton pioneer, passed peacefully
away at the residence of her daugh
ter, Mrs. Nora Marvin, in this village
morning. Mrs. Soule had been
confined to her bed but two weeks, and
the end came without suffering. Old
age was the cause of death.
Funeral services were conducted
from the Methodist church Tuesday
afternoon by Rev. E. B. Service, and
were largely attended. Special music
consisting of a vocal solo, "A Perfect
Day," by Mrs. Gibson a duett, "Over
the Line," by Rev. and Mrs. E. B. Ser
vice, and a song by a quartet com
posed of Mesdames C. A. Caley and E.
B. Service, and Messrs. Guy Ewing
and Grover Umbehocker, was ren
dered. Interment was in Oak Knoll
cemetery.
Deceased, whose maiden name was
Phoebe Morell Smith, was born in
Brownsville, Maine, Jan. 15,1826, so at
the time of her demise she had atCounty
tained the ripe old age of 90 years, two
months and five days. She was united
in marriage to Mr. Benjamin Soule
during the year of 1846, and 11 children
blessed the union, one of whom is liv
ing. During the year of 1855 Mrs.
Soule came to Minnesota, and resided
with her husband in Minneapolis the
following five years, when the family
came to Princeton. This place, has
since been her home. Mr. Soule an
swered the Master's summons 18 years
ago.
Mrs. Soule was a charitable, Chris
tian lady, and had. been affiliated with
the Methodist church 74 years. She
aided in the organization of the Prince
ton church, and ever displayed a whole
some interest in the good work. During
her residence of over half a century in
Princeton, she saw the place grow
from a sparse settlement a thriv
ing, modern village surrounded by a
thickly settled farming country. Mrs.
Soule made the first American flag
seen in Princeton, for the 4th of July
celebration held the year of her ar
rival. At that time the bare necessities
of life were the only things that could
be procured here. During the early
years of her residence in Princeton she
took an active interest in all matters
pertaining to the general welfare of
the community, and always exerted
a good influence. Her death marks the
passing of a beloved pioneer.
Commercial Club Meets.
A special meeting of the Commer
cial club was held at Allen's hall Mon
day evening, and about 30 of Prince
ton's business men attended. The
meeting was called for the purpose of
considering the advisability of fitting
up a club room, but no definite action
was taken. A committee consisting of
Messrs. S. S. Petterson, A. E. Allen
and E. K. Evens was named to ascer
the cost of equipping and main
taining a club room. When this com
mittee is ready to report another
meeting will be called, and something
definite done.
Princeton has had a Commercial club
for years, but it has not been notice
ably active. If a club room is provided
there is no doubt buj what interest
would increase, as the organization
would then become social as well as
business.
Several of our business men were
unable to attend the meeting Monday
evening, but they individually ex
pressed themselves as being favorable
to the proposition to be considered,
and in all probability favorable action
will be taken in the matter when the
committee reports.
O.tain
Jordan made a general inspection of
Princeton Tuesday, and found condi
tions fairly good, on the whole. Forty
business places were inspected, and
only six clean-up notices were issued,
which is a good showing on the part
of Princeton merchants. Several
changes in the electrical wiring of var
ious business houses were ordered,
however, as a measure of precaution.
Mr. Jordan informed us that the
Leathers blacksmith shop at the end
of First street would be condemned.
This means that it will be razed after
the necessary orders have been issued.
The high school and Whittier school
were inspected, and conditions were
not what could be termed satisfactory.
The Whittier school has no cloak
rooms, and the clothing of the child
ren is hung in the hallways and along
the stairways. The inspector consid
ered this to be a dangerous condition,
as in case of fire the clothing would
probably be brushed to the floor, with
the result that the children would trip
and stumble when their feet came in
contact with same. The stairways
contain abrupt angles, increasing the
dangers, and the inspector reported
that the boiler room is directly under
a class room, which is not a satisfac
tory arrangement.
At the high school building condi
tions were little or no better. Mr. Jor
dan found the fire hose in the base
ment disconnected, and the hose on the
first and second floors corded to reels.
This would,mean considerable delay in
an emergency. The labratory is tooSong
.small for. the number of pupils, as is
M. E. Sunday School Program.
The M. E. Sunday school has pre
pared a pleasing program to be ren
dered at the church next Sunday af
ternoon at 3 o'clock and a free-will
offering will be taken for missions. A
real treat is in store for those who at
tend. The program follows:.

CANVASSING BOARD
Meets at the Auditor's Office Friday,
and Goes Over Presidential
Primary Returns.
Total Vote Cast in County 1,600the
Democrats Poll Over 400
Votes at Election.
The county canvassing board, con
sisting of W. C. Doane, county audi
tor F. C. Cater, chairman of the board
of county commissioners Justice C.
F. J. Goebel of Milaca, and Justice
Dickey of Princeton, met at the audi
tor's office Friday and went over the
returns of the presidential preference
primary in Mille Lacs county.
Little interest was manifested in the
election by the voters of this county,
but 1,600 votes were polled, due noroad
to the fact that the annual town
meetings and village elections took
place on the same day.
Por Cummins delegates-at-large, J.
F. Jacobson, A. O. Eberhart, Marcus
Johnson and O. J. Larson were the
four highest, although James Mana
han was a close second to Larson for
fourth place Henry Rines had a sub
stantial lead over the other candi
dates for district delegates, and Low
ell E. Jepson was second high.
The democrats polled a surprisingly
large vote for a primary election.
President Wilson received 365 votes,
and as the head of the ticket was
overlooked by numerous voters the to
tal must have been well over 400. The
Lynch and anti-Lynch forces divided
honors in this county. Daniel W. Law-
W. A. Just, Z. H. Austin and C. M.
King were the high ones in the field
of candidates for delegates-at-large to
the St. Louis convention. The first
two named are Lynch men, while Aus
tin and King are opposed to the na
tional committeeman. S. J. Mealey, a
Lynch candidate, headed the list of
district delegates, and A. S. Dowdall,
anti-Lynch, was second high.
Very few voters called for prohibi
tion ballots, and in the villages of
Foreston and Wahkon, and the towns
Princeton, Mudgett, Onamia, and
East Side not a prohibition vote was
cast. Eugene N. Foss received 27 votes
in the county and William Sulzer 19.
There is no doubt but what the med
ley of names on the ballots confused
numerous of the voters, who were not
familiar with the candidates, and reg
istered random shots into the dark as
a result. Hereunder appear the official totals
of the republican and democratic can
didates as returned by the canvassing
board:

County Seat Fight in Benton.
Another county seat fight will soon
be on in Benton county. A few years
ago, after a hard struggle, the county
seat was changed from Sauk Rapids
to Foley, now a move is on foot to
bring the court house back to the
Rapids. Foley is nearer the geograph
ical center of the county-than Sauk
Rapids, as the latter place is located
in the extreme southwestern corner
of the county. But the west end of
the county has gained in population
within the past few years, and if the
towns along the Northern Pacific work
in unison the Foley people will have
to do some tall hustling if they wish
to see their town remain the capital
of the county. The real geographical
center of Benton county would be
somewhere in or about Section 16 in
the town of Gilmanton. One thing is
certain, the Foley people will fight
and fight hard to retain the court
house.
Improvements at the Creamery.
Various changes are under way at
the Princeton Co-operative creamery,
and when completed conditions will be
materially bettered.
The engine room is being remodeled
three additional windows are being
put in, and it will be used as an office.
The refrigerator will be moved into
the present office, and the space now
occupied by the refrigerator will be
fitted up as a weigh 100m. A. F.
Meyers, president of the creamery
company, is personally supervising the
work. A new cream vat and three new
motors will also be installed. The
changes will make more room, and add
to the convenience of the local cream-
