Paris, March 21-After a bombardment
carrIed on with great violence for an en
tire daY. the German army of the crown
prince this afternoon stormed and cap
tured French positions on Haucourt Hill
in Its Ranking movement against IA Mort
Homme (Dead Man).
The German advance on the slopes of
Haucourt I admitted by the French war
office, which, however, reports that their
attempts to debouch from Avocourt wood,
-tured on the previous day, were re
pulsed.
The latest German move marks an at
tempt to eit the Verdun-Parts Railway
and win positions for a flanking fire
against the French in the Dead Man re
gion.
The importance of the hill is explained
by Lieut. Col. Rougs. the noted military
critic. as follows:
In order that our success (the cap
ture of Avocourt woods). which we by
no means seek to belittle. shall not prove
sterile. there must be a seiel in the
shiaoe of a further advance, ending with
the cpture of one of the dominating hills
enct.!ing the Avocourt woods.
If the crown prince's objective in at
acking in this sector is to endanger our
position at Le Mort Homme by a fianking
tire. he must push his attacks to the
eastward. storm Hill No. 3M, betwee
Malancourt and Fanes, frotn whigb point
I, could dominate Le Mort Homme."

The same disregard for human life is
haracterizing the present attacks as
in other sectors. According to

ian attempt has resulted In an advance

Th- flghtin now going on from Riga

Central Powers Declare Entente Must

Sreal Cable to The washiston Herald.
Berlin, March 21.-(via The iague.
March 22)-Rumors that peace is im

as Germany is concerned. Responsible
offietals here deny that there is rea

Rumors are constantly current in Ger
many that peace negotiations of a ten

country, but not in a single instance so
far has investigation proved that there
was any ground for these reports.

made by Chancellor van Bethmann Holl

that at that time Germany was ready
to negotiate for pcace, but could not
do so on terms of a ruined Germany,
which seemed to be the aim of the
allIes.
There was much criticism of the chan

adopted a resenable attitude and realized
the futility of the dream of destroying
the German empire.
Military Preparations Coattaue.
In the meantime military preparations
have been going forward on the basis
of a war to last indefinitely.
Some comment has been occasioned in
Germany recently by the speeches in
the house of commons in which it was
suggested that England ought to initiate
a peace movement and the reply of
Mr. Asquith. In which he reiterated the
statement that the allies would never
sheath the sword till Pussian militarism
had been destroyed.
Germans say it is futile to hope for
peae so long as England is guided by
rhetoric instead of realities.

leaped from the basket, By that time
the balloon had drifted beyond the reach
of the naked eye and it wasn't until the
soldiers saw a speck descending that they
realized what had -happend.
"The officer, in telling the story, said:
'After jumping I fell like a atone for the
