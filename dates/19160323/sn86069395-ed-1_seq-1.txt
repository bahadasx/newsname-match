THE CHRISTIAN COUNTY WAY.
Christian countv has n w.w of dn-
Njncr the rirrht thinf. nt Iho riaht limn
find in the right way. Under a recent
wbioiuu ui iuu Lfum l uniuuiaus. war
rant is given ror tne belief that an nr-
A.....41.. ! 11 it. t I- t
iiiuwiivi. i.iujuiiijr 10 tin umi la uuuu-
cd to carry a bond Issue for the build
ing of roads. Under the strictest of
constructions, if two-thirds of the
votes cast are in the ' affirmative, the
bond issue carries. Just to make
certain, three-fourths of the votes
cast by Christian county were for a
bond issue.
The amount, $400,000, is sufficient
(9. give the county a complete system
of roads.
Having provided the money, Chris
tian county has made sure of its hon
est and intelligent expenditure. A
commission representing every mag
isterial district has been named by
the citizens of those districts with the
approval of the Fiscal Court to have
charge of the work of construction.
In addition to that precaution,
Christian county has obtained the
services of a United States engineer
in the making of surveys and the
general supervision of the roads to be
built or improved with the money
voted.
If the Christian eounly plan is fol
lowed by every other county that
votes bonds, Kentucky will have the
best system of roads to be found in
, any of the forty-eight States and that
kite another three years have pass-

Estimates of the valuo of stable ma

manure i)f one such animal nets the
farmfcr $8.22.
All the papers 'are having some
thing nice to &iy about the way
Christian comity put the bond issue
over last veek. There are other
counties in Kentucky, but there is
only'one like Christian county and
there is only one Hopkinsville.

San Anionic Tex, March 22.
Gen. Frederick Funston yesterday
asked the war department for more
troops to be sent into Mexico in pur
suit of Francisco Villa.
The request was made at the sug
gestion of Gen. John J. Pershing,
commander Of the expedition, who
urged that another regiment be sent
to him. In his message to the war
department. Gen. Funston asked for
what he termed an "adequate force."
TELEPHONE WIRES CUT.
El Paso, Tex., March 22. Follow
ing hard on the news that the Mexi
can telegraph and telephone wires be
tween Juarez and Casas Grandes had
been cut, word came from Columbus
last night in a dispatch passed by the
censor that both wireless and ground
wire communication with Gen. Persh
ing had failed. The army field wire
between Columbus and headquarters
of the expeditionary force Was sever
ed in twenty-eight places, it was said.
The trouble WUh tho wireless oc
curred sJioTUy jjpfore 6 o:lock Tues

TWO AVIATORS LOST.
Columbus, N. M., March 22.Two
lieutenants of the First aero squadron
are lost somewhere in the desert foot
hills of the Sierre Madre, with but
three days' rations and two small
canteens of water between them and
starvation, it was officially made
kuown at military headquarters here
last nieht. Army officers do not
credit reports in Columbus that the
two lieutenants may have fallen vic
tims of snipers.
Radios to Maj. Sample, command
ant here, received from Capt. Foulois
at Casas Grandes, commanding the
aero corps, recited that Lieut. Willis
and Lieut. Gorrell, who left here Sun
day on army aeroplanes, had failed
to arrive at the advance base and that
no reports of the missing men or
their biplanes had been received. In
structions were issued to drivers of
motor trucks leaving here to watch
for traces of the missing men. It is
believed also that some of the six
aeroplanes which arrived safely at
Casas Grandes are being employed in
the search.
The eight planes started from here
late Sunday for the flight over 110
miles of desert and mountains through
the Casas Grandes valley to join the
expeditionary force. Neither of the
men was accompanied by a median
ician or by an observer, and shortly
after the flight began the two planes
were detached from the others,
Nothing has been heard from cither
since.

WEATHER NOT SO GOOD
But Hundreds Braved the
Wind and Dust Clouds
to Attend.
The weather clerk was not good to
the ladies yesterday and those who
attended the spring openings were
called upon to brave the worst spell
of March weather the whole month
had turned out. The wind amounted
almost to a gale, sending clouds of
dust through the streets and adding
to the discomforts of all who appear
ed outside the house. The sun was
out at times, but the weather was
very threatening.
J. II. Andorson & Co., Frankel's
Busy Store, J. T. Edwards Co., Miss
Fannie B. Rogers and Miss Ida Blum
enstiel all advertised their openings
for yesterday and to-day.
At all or these stores things were
in gala attire and the elaborate dis
plays of new goods and late styles
wore very attractive. The ladies
were much interested and hundreds
of them made the rounds, inspecting
the pretty things.
At Anderson's there were pretty
decorations and music by an orches
tra and the opening was highly satis
factory 111 every way. " "
The opening at Frankel's Busy
Store attracted an unusually big
crowd. A novel feature was the
presence of Miss Pauline Wenvr, of
New York, a model who domonstrat-
ed the spring styles and gave exhibi-
' tions of all of the modern dances,
Hesitation, Maxixe, Tango, Turkey
Trot and others. Mr. Seegar assisted
as a partner in the dances.
The crowd all day was large but at
times overflowed the big rooms on
the second floor where the display
was made in the millinery and dress
departments.
The displays will continue to-day
and the spring season will be fairly
inaugurated.
Watch the advertising columns for
details of the offerings.

GERMAN IH
DRAWS CLOSER
But the French Hold Foes
After Advance With Ar
tillery Fire.
RUSSIANS AGGRESSIVE
Austrians and Italians Also
Hard at It on Land and
In Air.
In their attempts to flank Verdun
on the west, the Germans, having
succeeded in working their way
through the Malancourt wood and the
Avocourt court, have begun a heavy
bombardment of the village of Esncs,
about eight miles northwest of Ver
dun, and hill 304, which lies about a
mile and a half north of Esncs.
The French, however, are vigor
ously contesting a further advance
eastward, which not alone would
bring the German line nearer the
fortress, but spreading fan-like north
eastward, would put in jeopardy the
French in the region of Le Mort Hom
me. So great has been the counter-offensive
of the French guns that, after
debouching from the woods, the Ger
mans were unable to launch an infan
try attack, and presumably are being
held hard to their newly-gained lines.
To the north and east of Verdun,
the cannonading lias been only inter
mittent. In the Argonne forest, in
Lorraine and m upper Alsace tlio
French guns have been active against
German positions and marching col
umns. On the River Somme the
Germans entered a British trench,
but immediately were driven out.
There has been lively fighting be
tween the Russians and the Germans
west of Jacobstadt, along the Dvina
river and in-the lake region between
Dvinsk and Vilna, with the Russians
generally on the offensive.
While Berlin reports these attacks
as having been repulsed with heavy
losses, the admission is made that a
German salient near Like Narocz was
withdrawn in order to recover the
encircling fire of the Russians.
Near Butzitisczki, midway between
Dvinsk and Vilna, the Russians have
captured advanced German trenches,
and just south of Dvinsk, in the re
gion of Novo Alexandrovsk, have re
pulsed a German counter attuck on
positions taken at Velikoiesclo.
I Petrograd says that in the capture
' of the Austrian bridgehead near the
j village of Mikhaltche, in Galicia, most
j of its defenders were killed in hand
! to-hand fighting.
The Russians have thrown their
line several miles nearer Trobizond,
on the Black sea coast, aftor further
fighting with the Turks. Ispahan,
Persia, is reported to have been taken
by the Russians.
1 Heavy fighting continues between
the Austrians and Italians along the
greater part of the Austro-Italian line,
t especially on the front from Rovereto
to the Gorizia heights. No important
change in positions have taken place,
; however.
j A successful night attack by Austr
Hungarian aviators has been carried
out against the port and barracks of
Avlona, Albania, according to Tionna.
