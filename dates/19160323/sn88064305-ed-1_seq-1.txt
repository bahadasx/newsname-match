5200,000 FOR JOHN DIBERT
MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
Lumber King Widow to Give $50,000
Cash and $150,000 Fund in
Tuberculosis Fight.
Mrs. Eve Christine Debert,
widow of the millionaire lumber
manufacturer, John Dibert, has
donated the sum of $200,000 for
the establishment of a tuberculosis
hospital for the city of New Or
leans-a memorial to her late
husband.
The city of New Orleans will
give $10,000 annually for main
tenance of the hospital, and do
nate a square of ground on Car.
rolton avenue as a site.
A dream or Mayor Martin
Behrman, Commissioner Harold
W. Newman and others is to be
come a reality; New Orleans will
possess, through this magnificent
gift of Mrs. Dibert, a modern,
up-to-date tubercular hospital.
Of the total amount, Mrs. Di
bert gives $50,000 in cash for the
erection of buildings and $150,
000 in securities as a trust fund,
only the revenue to be used.
The site, a square of ground
bounded by Carrolton avenue,
Tulane, Union and Solomon
streets, which was purchased by
the city several years ago for a
boys high school has been pro
nounced ideal for this institution.
When communicated with Sat
urday night relative to the dona
tion,she modestly suggested that
her letter to Mr. Newman 'told
the whole story."
"It is just a beginning," she
added, "and I would prefer ae
little publicity as possible."
Mrs. Dibert, it will be recalled,
gave $5,000 for the Charity Hos
pital fund, by telegraph, when
Chif was launohed. She has been
equally generous in other worthy
charities, many of which have
never come to public notice, be
cause of her expressed wish that
they should not.
Test Your Seed
Before Planting.
You are laying one of the es
sentials necessary for failure
when you put poor quality seed
into the ground. It will cost you
a very small amount to test your
seed and plant those of strong
vitality and you will be more
than amply paid for your trouble
when it is harvesting time.
I shall give only one method
for testing seed corn, but the
same can be applied for other
seeds.
After you have carefully select
ed your corn in the field and
kep it from the weevils during
the winter, then husk and care
fully sel~ot the ears that most
closely approaches your ideal
for your seed.
Take an ordinary box about
two feet wide and three feet long
and any death. Fill this box
with sawdust to about five inches
of the top or sand may be used
either, Get two yards of cheap
domestic or some other white
goods and tack one end of the
domestic over the sawdust or sand
very closely, then mark this off
in squares of about two inches.
Mark each square with number
or letter and after numbering
each ear accordingty, take 10
grains of corn from each ear and
place in the square marked like
the ear from which the corn is
taken.
Carefully pull the loose end of
the cloth over the seed after all
squares have been filled. Put
more sawdust over the top of this
cloth and then wet thoroughly
and put box in a warm place for
the seed to germinate. In about
a week after the corn has been
placed as shown abo re you may
remove the sawdust or sand from
the top cloth carefully and raise
the cloth carefully and you see
which ears will sprout best and
select the ears of the strongest
vitality for your seed. The same
box may be used for a whole
planting season if carefully
handled. Rid yourselves of the
cry of wire worms and insect
pests when it is a poor quality of
seed planted.
