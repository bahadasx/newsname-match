MAYES FOR SENATE
We tako pleasure in announcing
in thta issue of the Herald the
candklncy ol Hon. Von Mayes,
now Representative of Pemiscot
county, for the Democratic nomi
nation at the August primary for
1 State Senator from this (23rd)
Senatorial district, composed of
Pemiscot, New Madrid, Mis
sissippi, Stoddard and Scott
counties. Wo wish to say that
we can gladly recommend Mr.
Mayes to the voters of this dis
trict as being an upright citizen,
a brilliant lawyer of this county,
and one who possesses a legion
of friends, and so far as we have
ever heard, no enemies. The
people of this community have
known him lor years, and know
ing him as we do. we are for him
to a man. We know him to be
scrupulously honest, fair minded
and well informed. His standing
as a lawyer and citizen commends
him 10 the confidence of people.
He was reared in Southeast Mis
souri, and knows the needs and
wants of the people of this sec
tion oL" the state. As a member
of tin: last General Assembly he
mud a record that assures us
if sent to the Senate he will serve
us to our udvnniit'gc. He was the
author of the law which carved" a
now Judicial Circuit out of Pemi
scot and Now Madrid counties, a
law tnat has been long needed
and which has resulted in a sav
ing to the tax-payers of a great
amount of money which other
wise would have been paid out for
court costs. While in the legis
lature Mr. Mayes did something
for his constituency. He was al
ways at his post, and worked
hard and accomplished what he
undertook. These are matters
that entitle him to seek the
nomination he does. We are for
him pot only because we know
him to bo a gentleman and a
schol r, out because his services
wil1 !n of value to the state. He
is an active Democrat, having al
ways spent his time and money
in fighting for his party. We will
be glad to see the voters of this
district rally to his standard.
Our lawyers and some of the
Haj ti citizens have been attend
ing circuit court in Caruthers
ville tni- week.

An inquiry was received this
week from the German State
Bank of Springfield, Mo.,- con
cerning our School Savings
Bank, stating that they were
trying to interest the Board of

plans, and also suggestions
which might help to 'induce the
Board of Education of Spring'
field to try out the plan.
The Seniors will give their
play about a week before the
close of school. They have se
lected a very strong comedy
drama, and with ample time for
learning the parts, wo feel cer
tain that this will be one of the
best of the yeav.
The boys and girls who com
pose the agriculture classes will
begin work in the school garden
