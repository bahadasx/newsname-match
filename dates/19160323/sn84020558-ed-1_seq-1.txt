WASHINGTON, March 22. Final
action on the Hay army increase bill
was in sight tonight when the house
adjourned. With only two import
ant sections remaining to be dis
cussed, passage of the measure some
time tomorrow is assured.
The bill will come up in the sen
ate probably next Monday. Chair
man Chamberlain, of the senate mili
tary committee, announced today that
he would await the arrival of the
house bill, give it brief consideration
in committee 'and ask for its im
mediate consideration in the senate.
As a preliminary step on army
legislation, the senate passed during
the day, by a vote of 59 to 2, the
Mil virtually doubling the author
ized strength of the cadet corps at
West Point military academy. A
similar measure applying to the naval
academy has been signed by the
president.
The Hay bill has not been altered
In any of its broad aspects during the
three-day struggle in the house with
amendments. Chairman Hay has
been defeated only once, having ap
proved every other change made in
the detail of the measure. It is prac
tically certain the bill will go to the
Senate virtually as framed by the
committee.
One section still to be disposed of,
however, is the vital element of .the
whole army plan proposed. It is the
militia nav orovision. under w hich
pay provision, under
the bill is expected to produce a force
of 425,000 national guardsmen within
five years as a substitute for the
administration's continental' army
proposal.
The section had been read when
the house adjourned and Representa-

Chinese Monarchy Is

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, March 22. In the
downfall of Yuan' Shi Kai's plans for
making himself emperor, hope is seen
in official and diplomatic circles here
for early restoration of peace in
China and maintaenanc-i of the status
quo in the Far East during the Eu
ropean war.
Press dispatches announcing the
abandonment of the proposed mon
archy occasioned no great surprise,
although there had been no report of
the action either to the state depart
ment or the 'Chinese legation, and
recent dispatches had not indicated
that the step was imminent.
The province of Yunnan, rebelling
against the overthrow of the republic,
has been maintaining its indepen
dence, of the central government for
months, and reports of discontent
snd revolt have come thick and fast
from the southern districts.
In addition to this state of affairs
at home, Yuan has faced powerful
opposition to his plans from the ouf
side. Great Britain. Japan and Rus
sia have exerted pressure to prevent
any governmental change at this
time,.-.
Yuan had expected to proclaim the
monarchy and ascend the throne be
fore the beginning of the new year.
When the time came, however, it wai
announced that the proclamation had

NASHVILLE, Tenn., March 22. A
ball of yarn, lighted and thrown by a
boy into dry grass in a vacant lot,
started a conflagration in Nashville at
noon today which was not under con
trol until late this afternoon after 35
residence blocks had been swept by the
fire. The loss is estimated at $1,500,000.
A wind driving at 50 miles an hour
fanned the burning grass into flames
which quickly caught a planning mill
and leaped from building to build
ing until at least 600 residences had
been destroyed, the Warner Public
school and several churches reduced to
ruins.
Tonight It is estimated that at least
3.000 persons are homeless as a result
of the fire.
National guardsmen called out by
Governor Rye went on duty in the fire
zone late today and will remain there
for several days to aid in relief work
and prevent looting.
Pitiful scenes were everywhere in
evidence tonight. The fire spread with
such suddenness that members of many
families were separated. Several men
were looking vainly for their wives and
parents were looking for their child
ren. It is believed that most of the
missing will be located in- homes of
Nashville residents where homeless
were taken after the fire. Thril
ling rescues were made. Several women
were saved by men who risked their
lives by rushing through the flames.
Eight hundred children were at reci-

Infantry attacks northwest of Ver
dun, preceded by a vigorous bom
bardment, have enabled the Gerrrfilns
to gain a foothold on the small hill
of Haucourt, . which lies just, outside
the village of Malancourt and be;
tween that town and the eastern edge
of the Malancourt wood.
'An entire sector of about two and
a half miles from the Avercourt wood
to Malancourt has been subjected to
a .violent artillery bombardment and
several infantry attacks, but except
in the immediate vicinity of Malan
court the Gentians were held by the
French barrier fire and were unable
to advance.
Northeast of Verdun, around Dou
aumont and Vaux, an intense artil
lery bombardment still is in progress.
The infantry forces, however, have
remained inactive in this district.
From the west, in the forest of the
Argonne, the French are heavily
shelling the Malancourt wood, which
is in the hands of the Germans, and
at various points in the forest have
bombarded German organizations, and
especially at Four De Paris, La Fille
Morte and Montfalcon.
The Russian offensive against the
Germans in northwest Russia has in
creased in intensity and fighting is
in progress day and night. The lat
est official statement from Russian
general headquarters says that des
perate infantry fighting is proceed
ing noith of the town of Postav,
where the Germans launch violent
counter attacks in an attempt to1" dis
lodge the Russians from trenches
which they had previously captured.
Respecting this operation the Berlin
communication says that at this point
the Russians delivered their attack
and their losses reached "extraor
dinarily high figures even for the
number of Russians in action."
The Russians captured three lines
of the German trenches on the south
western shore of Lake Narooz. where
it is officially declared the fighting
Is developing in favor of the Russian
forces. Here the Russians, despite
'asphyxiating gases and a murderous
fire" forced three lines .of wire en
tanglements and made their gains in
n sries of fierce hand-to-hand en
counters. The Russian war office also offi
cially announces the capture of Is
pahan in Persia after an engage

by way of Rome and London says
that the Austrians have abandoned
Czernowitz, capitol of Bukowina.
Bad weather again has broken over
the Austro-Italian front, but it has
not put a stop to the violent bom
bardments. The Austrians have de
livered surprise attacks with infantry
against Italian positions at various
points, but these, according to Rome,
have been repulsed.

WASHINGTON, March 22. Grave
apprehension regarding the outcome' of
the American expedition into Mexico in
pursuit of Villa was evident for the
first time in Washington tonight, af
ter receipt by the war department of
a dispatch from General Funston say
ing a report had reached him that 2000
Carranza troops at Chihuahua under
General Luis Herrera had revolted and
-iligned themselves with the bandit
chief
General Funston did not disclose the
source of his information and so far
as could be learned, no confiramation
had reached the state department or
the Mexican embassy. Fear that the
report might be true was not disguised
in official circles and developments
were awaited with tense anxiety.
If Herrera and his troops have joined
Villa, some officials believe that other
Carranza commanders and troops may
follow their example. In such an event
the United States and the de facto
government of Mexico would find them
selves confronted with a situation so
serious that its possibilities hardly
could be estimated. A large part of
the forces of the de facto government
in northern Mexico formerly were Villa
soldiers and with t.ieir officers have
followed the bandit chieftain to many
hard fought victories.
The troops under Herrera are de
scribed here as being probably the
best equipped in northern Mexico and
they are said to be well supplied with
ammunition. Luis Herrera at one time
was one of Villa's most active aides, as
was his brother, Maclovio, before his
death.
Rumors concerning the doubtful in
tentions of the Arrieta brothers," lead
ing a force in Durango, also have tend
ed to increase disquiet here. Rebellion
in Carranza's army, would render the
position of the American expeditionary
force so perilious that every available
soldier would be rushed in to reinforce
the advancing columns. For this pur
pose not more than 1H.000 men would
available without' calling out the
National guard. There now are on the
border or in Mexico in the neighbor
hood of 25,000 soldiers and in the v hole
of the continental United States the
other mobile forces number only a lit
tle more than 5,000.
All reports from the border were sent
to the White House tonight and were
the subject of a long conference dur
ing the whole evening between Presi
dent Wilson and Secretary liaker. Af
terwards Mr. liaker declined to talk.
Before the Funston report arrived,
Counsellor Polk of the state depart
ment and Eliseo Arredondo, the Mex
ican ambassador designate; had com
peted the draft of the protocol asked
or bv General Carranza to govern the
operations of the American forces in
Mexico and provide for co-operation

ment. Mr. Polk and Mr. Arredondo
are in entire accord on the terms of the
proposed convention, and the latter
dispatched it to General Carranza witl;
the recommendation that it be ap
proved. It would become effective im
mediately upon being signed.
State department officials insisted
during the day that all their reports
from the interior of Mexico and from
the border showed that conditions gen
erally were quiet and dispatches from
many points were made public to sus
tain their statements.
Soon after, however, the dispatch
from General Funston was received,
and then it became known that the
navy department had not heard from
the gunboat Machias. stationed off
Tampico, since yesterday afternoon
The Machias, it was said, should have
reported today, but up to a late hour
tonight no message had come from her
commander to confirm or deny rumors
that the gunboat had taken aboard for
protection any foreigners at Tampico.
The navy department allowed it to
become known that the battleship
Kentucky, once ordered to Mexican
waters, from New Orleans and then
diverted to Galveston, again Jiad been
ordered to proceed southward and to
cruise off the Mexican coast in the vi
cinity of Tampico. When the Ken
tucky was diverted it was said that it
had developed there was no 'need of an
additional warship. The war depart
ment made public no information con
cerning the movements of the expecli.
tion in Mexico. It was said that sev
eral dispatches had been received from
General Pershing, in command of the
American troops, but that they all were
of a routine nature.
Late tonight General Funston re
ported to the war department that an
investigation had developed there was
no truth in a report that twenty-seven
army motor lories had been found

DOUGLAS, Ariz., March 22. Six
Catholic priests, who reached Negates,
Ariz., today from Hermosillo, Guaymas
and other cities in western Sonora,
were deported from Mexico because
they have been spreading the gospel of
strife and intervention, instead of the
gospel of God, according to a statement
issued late today by General P. Elias
Calles, military governor of Sonora,. at
his temporary headquarters in Agua
Prieta, opposite here.
"These men were ordered from
Mexico only after we had proved be
yond any doubt that they had been
active in supporting the cientifuco
faction," General Cailes stated. "They
have been urging the ignorant classes
their districts to acts that would

United States.
"I am very sorry that it was neces
sary for the state to take this action,
ut some such action was necessary to
prevent disorders, and possible serious
differences.
"At the same time I wish everyone
to understand that the deportation of
these priests is not intended by the
constitutional government of Sonora as
an unfriendly act toward the Catholic
church of the state. The men were
sent away merely as undesirable resi
dents.
"Should the Catholic church desire
to send good priests to Mexico to take
the places of these six priests, the au
thorities of the state will welcome
them. Furthermore, they will continue
to be welcomed and aided in their
work, so long as they confine their ac
tivities to the church.

you call it folly for Mexico to attempt
to keep all priests from Mexico when

At tint time a detachment of the

and one of the aeroplanes sent south

EL PASO, March 22. The silence
which for two days has enveloped the
Mexican situation as far as any defin
ite news of the pursuit of Pancho Villa
is concerned, gave fresh force today to
tiie numerous reports from various
sources of grave disaffection among
the Carranzista troops. On rffe border,
at least it is firmly believed that the
soldiers of first chief are far from giv
ing any real co-operation to the Ameri
can expeditionary force. It is ad
mitted that General Carranza and
some of his lieutenants are sincerely
anxious to avoid friction with the
United States but it is not believed
that the head of the de facto govern
ment represents the attitude or senti
ments of his army or fellow citizens.
From several different sources, a
circumstantial report was received to
day that the garrison at Chihuahua,
supposed to number 2000 men, had re
volted and that their commander.
General Luis Herrera had declared In
favor of Villa. Andres Garcia, the
Carranza consul here, emphatically
branded this report as false but in high
official circles here it was accepted as
at least possible in view of the fact
that more than half of the Mexican
troops at Chihuahua were former
Villistas.
Since yesterday morning General
1 Gavira at Juarez has claimed that the
wires along the Northwestern railroad
between Juarez and Casas Grandes
have been cut and that consequently
he could give no information in regard
to the reported battle at Namiquipa
between the Carranzistas and Villistas.
Americans here, especially refugees
from Mexico, are frankly skeptical both
as to the reported battle and the (kit

COLUMBUS, N. M, March 22.
(Passed by Censor) General Luis
Herrera, until recently Carranza mil
itary governor of Chihuahua, has re
nounced Carranza and announced in
favor of Villa, taking the field in
western Chihuahua with 2,000 troops,
according to reliable information re
ceived here tonight.
The exact place at which General
Herrera's troops are encamped was
not indicated in the message which
reached Columbus from a urce that
always has been highly reliable. It
is believed, however, that the troops,
most of whom recently constituted
the Orranza, garrison at Chihuahua
City are some place in the distance
between San Pedro and Chihuahua
and are preparing to work north and
I ve.5t toward the American punitive
exjedition, in the field under General
Pershing.
The sentiment of the people in this
district, which lies about 70 miles di
rectly east of the Guerrero region in
which Villa began his days as an
outlaw, js strongly in favor 'of the
bandit chieftain. His success in with
standing Porf.nro Diaz's rurales for
eight years, during all of which time,
there was a heavy price on his
held, was flue to the loyalty of the
peons, who worship Pancho Villa as
an idol. Army men believe here that
Herrera and his command will have
every possible cooperation from the
people of the district
General Luis Herrera was one of
Villa's brigade commanders from 11)13
to 1915. He. with his brother, Mac
lovic Herrera, were born in Southern
Chihuahua and raised a brigade of
troops from that region which at
tained great prominence in the early
Villa campaigns.
Maclovio Herrera, the youngest of
th"? two, was the active leader in the
field and was regarded as one of tl-.o
mot dashing of Villa's officers, while,
Luis Herrera's services were freely
used in an administrative capacity in
the territory captured by Villa.
So highly were Maclovie Herrera's
services as a fighter regarded that he
decided at one time early in 1911
that he was not receiving a proper
shire of the booty from the cam
paign. He s said to have made a
demand for share to Villa on a rail
road platform at Jiminez as the lat
ter was about to depart for Chi
huahua. Herrera is said to have
faced down his chief and secured
booty aggregating 27.000 pesos and a
motor car.
It is reported that after that, occur
rence, there was a coolness lietween
the men and Maclovie was deprived
of the Zaragosa brigade, the crack
organization of Villa's army, which
was turned over to Raoul Madero.
Thereafter ne.ther of the Herera,
brothers was c.verzealous in Villa's
cause, although Luis Herrera joined
the Carranza rank's and it was re-
Lported that he was given command
as military governor of Chihuahua
because of his wide knowledge of the
country, his influence with the peo-
