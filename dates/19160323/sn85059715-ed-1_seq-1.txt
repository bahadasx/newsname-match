Funston Not Sore the Herrera
Forces Have Joined Villa
against United States.
MAY NOT GET RAILWAY
New Situation is Being Carefully
Considered and It Will
Be Met Promptly.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex.. March 28.?
Orders going from Fort Sam Houston
today provide for rapid action at
points along the border should new
rebellions In Mexico mate It necessary.
General Funston was uot altogether
convinced or the truth of the report
that General Luis Herrera. the
disposed military leader at Chihuahua,
had entered the field with Villa
against the United states, but the
repetition of the report and the abL'O
n OA A T "** J 4
. VFI wi'^riauic cuuriivf IU iuc
contrary caused the general and his
staff to regard.il as probably true.
The censorship imposed at El Paso
by General Pell was done without orders
from headquarters here, but It
is known that General Bell has authority
to go far in the exercising of
his own Judgment In meeting an extraordinary
situation.
StafT officers of General Funston
studied a more extended area of
northern Mexico today. The probable
moves of Herrera and bis 2,01.
men were carefully considered and at
t-rery point along the border note was
taken of the position of American
troops and the time It would take to
move them to meet any situation.
Army officers believe that if Herrera.
has revolted his activities will be
confined to operations that have for
their object the strengthening of Villa's
band and the harassing of General
Pershing's force.
It was feared that he would cut
the N'orthwestern railway over which
Genera] Funston hopes to receive
permission to remove supplies to the
American troops now almost zwn
miles Into Mexico.- To prevent this
move General Funston Is powerless
aud it is doubted if Carranza troops
are in position to oppose Herrera.
VILLA IS IN POSITION
TO HARASS PERSHING
tmr AtiociiTiD PRttci
EL PASO, March . 23;?Francisco
Villa has established a base to the
westward of Namaquipa to leorganize
bis command and recruit new men
for his army, it was reported here
Thursday. At this new base it was
said Villa would lay planB to operate
with the force of General Luis Herrera,
who is understood to have renounced
the defacto government. The
American army base at Columbus has
had no news of Villa for over two
days.
General Herrera, until recently in
command of the Carranza garrison at i
Chihuahua City, is said to be moving
northwestward to efTect a juncture
with Villa and. this, in connection
with the report that the Carranza
garrison at Torreon had revolted, has
occasioned grave concern among the]
American army olllcars in El Paso.
Villa men. augmented by the
command of General HerTera, said to
number 2,000 men. might be in a po-1
sition to harass General Pershing's
army and sertoitBly Interrupt the line
of communication between the advanced
buse of American forces at
Casas Grants and the base at Columbus.
An eurlv agreement with the Car
vnnza government for permission to
use Mexican railway lines is desired
by army officers. The main base
would then be transferred from Co*
ltimbUB to El Paso and the Mexican
Northwestern railway could be UBed
to ship men and supplies to Casos
CI randes.
The railroad could be easily main-,
tained againat Interruption, while
' the present line southward out of
Columbus over a desert might be
readily cut Bhould Villa recruit a formidable
body of men. Villa is said
' to have sent agents among the populace
in the mountain districts, urging
the mto support him against the
Americans and is equipping bis men
with arms and ammunition which he
had Btored.
There is no confirmation of a report
that Colonel Cano, of Carrahza's
army had joined forces with Villa.
All was quiet in Juarez eaj*ly today
and street car service, which was
suspended lost night for fear of
trouble, was resumed. The railroad
bridges, however, are still under
? guard. j
MOTOR TRUCKS ARE

COLUMBUS, N. M., March 23.?Although
officially denied at army headquarters
here as an "unfounded falsehood,"

supplies to General Perchlng's command
In Mexico are missihg, together
with their drivers and guards.
Two trucks with two drivers and
four guards which Idft Ascension for
Oasas Grandes last Monday have not

is said that a driver reported to the
