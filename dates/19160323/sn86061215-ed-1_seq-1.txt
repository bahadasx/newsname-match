Word of One Missing
American Aviator
Washington, D. C.f March 22.—
Senator Sherman of Illinois today
introduced a resolution to author
ize and direct the president at
once to call for 50,000 volunteers
for service in Mexico. Under the
rules it lies on the table until
tomorrow.
The resolution provides that
preference be given to members
of the organized militia that the
volunteers be held in service until
peace and sound government have
been established in Mexico and
that their operations be limited
within the territorial limits of
Mexico as an auxiliary to the
forces of Gen. Carranza.
El Paso, Tex., March 22. —The
Mexican railroad problem again
took first place in public interest
on the border today, following a
report that the American military
authorities were contemplating
sending a new column Into Mexico
from Fabens, a village thirty miles
east of here. It was stated that
this plan was under consideration
as an alternate should Gen. Car
ranza refuse the request of the
Washington government for the
use of the Mexican Northwestern
railroad over which to transport
supplies.
From Guadalupe, across the bor
der from Fabens, one of the best
wagon roads In northern Mexico
leads south, almost to El Valle.
That the railroad problem will
bring a real crisis In the relations
between the Carranzistas and
Americans Is firmly believed here.
There is a general Impression
that Gen. Carranza is playing for
time.
San Antonio, Tex., March 22.—Al
though it was sixty hours at noon to
day since Gen. Pershing filed his last
message regarding the disposition of
U. S. cavalry south of Casas Grandes,
Gen. Funston professed no anxiety as
to the welfare of any of the troops.
The exact whereabouts of Gen, Per
shing was unknown at headquarters
here. It was considered probable that
he was out with one of three detach
ments, away from his wireless and in
Do position to report.
Gen. Funston believed it not un
likely that by this time the Americans
and Villa's men had met. Villa was
reported to have had a superior force
but Gen. Funston professed confidence
that the smaller force of Americans
would be able to more than hold its
own.
Of the two regiments now on their
way to the border, all but one battal
ion will be sent into Mexico, increas
ing Gen. Pershing's force by about
2,000 men.
Telegraph wires between Torreon
and Piedras Negras, opposite Eagle
Pass, were cut today, according to a
telegram received here.
Army men admitted that the two
days' vain search for Lieuts. Robert
ft. Willis, Jr., and Edward S. Gorrell
has caused anxiety for their safety.
Instructions were sent to the sta
tions between here and Ascension to
assist in the search for the two miss
ing aviators.
Several possible explanations were
advanced for the flyers not reaching
Casas Grandes but the belief is prev
alent that they may have fallen victims
of snipers' bullets.
WIRE8 ARE CUT.
El Paso, Tex., March 22.—The wires
between El Paso, Juarez and Casas
Grandes today were still cut so that
for more than twenty-four hours Gen
eral Gavira has been without any
»jnews of what has been transpiring at
the scene of the reported fighting be
tween the Carranza and, Villa forces
near Namaquipa.

TO
FEDERALIZATION
OF THE MILITIA
KENTUCKY CONGRESSMAN SAYS
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL
IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
Washington, D. C., March 22.—The
debate in the house on the army bills
today developed opposition to the pro
posal to put the national guard under I
federal control, Representative Fields,
democrat, of Kentucky, asserting that
court decisions showed the guard
could not be federalized without
a
constitutional amendment.
Representative Wilson, republican,
of Connectiuct, offered an amendment
specifying oaths of enlistment for sold
iers and men of the national guard,
providing obligation to both the fed
eral and state governments, the feder
al right to their services to precede
that of the state.
The national defense program was
advanced another stage today when
the senate passed Senator Chamber
lain's bill to double the number of
cadets at the West Point military
academy.
TO USE NATIONAL GUARD?
Illinois Militia Officials Get Instruc
tions to Apply if Men Are Sum
moned to the Colors.
Springfield, 111., March 22.—It was
learned here today that quartermas
ters and commissary officers of the
Illinois national guard have been in
formed that it would be well for them
to report as soon as possible to the
United States army depot quarter
masters either in St. Louis or Chicago
for instructions in event of mobiliza
tion of the national guard.
SEALED ORDER FOR SHIP
U. S. Battleship Kentucky Believed To
Be Hurrying To Tampico Story
Not Cortfirmed.
Galveston, Tex., March 22. —The U.
S. battleship Kentucky which arrived
here yesterday morning and put to sea
under sealed orders late yesterday af
ternoon sailed before it was possible to
make deliveries of coal and supplies
which had been ordered. There are
persistent rumors that the Kentucky
was sent to Tampico but no confirma
tion was had today.
TOWN IN TEXAS
TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE OF PARIS
HOMELESS AND IN DIRE
NEED OF FOOD.
Paris, Tex., March 22.—With approxi
mately 10,000 persons homeless, the
entire business section of Paris wiped
out by fire, and from 1,600 to 2,000
dwellings destroyed, the flames which
started shortly after 5 o'clock yester
day afternoon still were ^burning at
different points in the city at day
break today. The property loss, from
the most authentic sources, stands at
from two and a half to three and a
half million dollars.
Rumors, vague but persistent, were
that from ten to thirty persons had
lost their lives. Confirmation, how
ever, was lacking and while, consid
ering the property damage, it seemed
miraculous there should have been no
deaths, the opinion of those best in
formed was that no person had met
death.
Thousands of homeless men, women
and children were being cared for as
best possible early today In private
residences, railway stations and the
few remaining public buildings. The
question of making definite arrange
ments to care for these unfortunates
was expected to be takeji up by the
city authorities early in the morning.
Food supplies will be the most serious
problem, every hotel, restaurant and
grocery in the city having been
destroyed.
The wind, which was blowing a gale
when the fire started at 5:30 yester
day and which had considerably
abated shortly after midnight, shifted
at daylight and the fire was slowly
traveling in a southerly direction,
spreading the flames throughout the
southern residence district, but in a
freakish manner, jumping whole
blocks in its progress.
Fire fighting apparatus from Dallas,
Greenville and other nearby cities was
assisting the local department in
bringing the flames under complete
control, which was expected goon
after dawn.

3zernowitz Is Abandoned to
Russians as Troops of
the Czar Advance
FIGHT FOR VERDUN
IN ITS FOURTH WEEK
[nfantry Held Back While
Big Guns Pave the Way
for Fresh Attacks
London, March 22.—Abandonment of
C^ernowitz, capital of Bukowina, by
the Austrians is reported in an official
wireless dispatch received here today
from Rome.
London, March 22.—A Bucharest
dispatch, forwarded from Amsterdam
by Central News, says the Turks have
evacuated Erzinjan, a fortress of Asia
Minor, 120 miles southeast of Erze
rum.
The Germans are heavily bombard
ing the village of Ennes, eight miles
northwest of Verdun, but the French
are contesting stubbornly and are
holding the Germans in check.
The battle for Verdun, now well in
its fourth week, oontinues with in
tensity but at present the infantry is
held in leash while the big guns pre
pare for further assaults.
The powerful German thrust west of
the Meuse which developed early this
week, halted when it reached the
southern edge of Avocourt wood. But
the activity of the German artillery
in this sector which Paris reports to
day particularly violent indicates the
German intention is probably to make
further determined effort to advance
this important flanking operation.
The situation on the eastern bank
of the Meuse is unchanged but here,
too, the artillery fire continues in
tense near Vaux and Damloup.
Russians and Germans are fighting
a lively battle along the Dvina river
and in the lake reigon between Dvinsk
and Vilna, with the Russians generally
on the offensive.
The Russians have pushed their
lines several miles farther toward
Trebizond on the Black sea coast after
severe fighting with the Turks.
The Italians and Austrians are still
fighting fiercely in the neighborhood
of Rovereto.
NEWSPAPER MEN
MUST JOIN ARMY
London, March 22.—The war office
has refused to exempt from army ser
vice a great many newspaper men and
women who have been designated by
the Newspaper Proprietors' associa
tion of London as essential to the
work of publishing the local papers.
Art editors, photographers and dark
room operators are not considered as
editorial staff employes by the war of
fice and it refused to exempt them
from military service. I'he same rul
ing was applied to all society editors,
Action editors, sporting editors and
headline writers. Sub editors (copy
readers) were for some unexplained
reason considered more essential to
the papers than any of the other mem
bers of the staffs.
"The general principle to be follow
ed," the war office ruled, "is that the
men to be exempted are serving some
vital purpose during a time of war."
Many of the leading London papers
were careful to publish a notice read
ing much like this: "It should be
mentioned that the editor of the Lon
don Blank has not applied for exemp
tion or postponement of service in
any case of any war age man on the
editorial staff."
WILSON RESENTS
RUMORS OF PEACE
Washington, D. C., March 22. —Pres
ident .Wilson was represented at the
white house today as being resentful
of the publication of stories that Am
bassador Gerard had reported Ger
many was about to make a move for
peace. The published reports were
characterized as unjustified and being
based on inferences. Yesterday the
state department took notice of the
publications by denying that Germany
had intimated to the United States
that the time was ripe for the United
States as the largest neutral to renew
its friendly offices for peace or that the
United States had been informed that
Mr. Gerard had been requested to post
pone his vacation because of pending
peace negotiations. The report was
again denied at the department today.
AUTOMOTIC PHONE

Chicago, March 22.—Mayor William

Under the provisions of the sale the
city is to receive $500,000 as compen
sation and $1,432,000 is to be added to

FRENCH OFFICE
El
OPINION SEEM8TO BE THAT CAN.
DIDATES SHOULDt LEAD THE
WAY TO BATTLB.
Paris, March 10.—(Correspondence
of The Associate^ Press.)—French
politicians are already much interest
ed in the question whether it will be
necessary for candidates for public of
fice after the reestablishment of peace
to have a war record. Some members
of the chamber of deputies who have
stuck to the Palais Bourbon instead of
joining the army have shown irritation
at the publicity given to exploits of
their colleagues, some of whom have
been killed and others like Monsieur
Maginot, former assistant secretary of
war, have been repeatedly cited in the
orders of the day.
One deputy who recently returned
to Paris on leave of absence said he
had found that presence at the front
was far better than an electoral cam
paign for his political interests as well
as for the salvation of the country.
"Besides," he said, "it is for the can
non to do the speaking now."
One socialist deputy, interrupting
an orator who was recalling the ex
ploits of one of their colleagues at the
front, declared: "It is not his place
his place is here." This opinion seems
to be shared by a considerable major
ity of the parliament but not altogeth
er by the public. The municipal coun
cil of the city of Neuilly, whose mayor,
Monsieur Nortier, who was also a
deputy and who enlisted at 60 years of
age, carried the colors of his regi
ment and was killed on the battlefield,
passed unanimously the following reso
lution:
"The municipal council of the city of
Neuilly-sur-Seine whose mayor, deputy
for the department of the Seine, fell
upon the field of honor, considering
that the defense of the country is the
first duty of a citizen, that equality
before the law is the formal right of
Frenchmen whoever they may be and
that no member of any elective body
should seek to avoid it, that the rep
resentatives of the people should be
the first to give the example of respect
for the law and the duties of citizens,
expresses the wish that all senators
and deputies of military fitness be
obliged to do their military duty as
well as all other citizens."
Socialists, radicals, radical social
ists and other elements of the left, see
in all such allusions an attack upon
the parliament and considerable anx
iety is betrayed in certain parties as
to whether this spirit will grow and
what effect it will have on politics
when hostilities have ceased on the
field of battle. There have also ap
peared speculations as to the accounts
that must inevitably be rendered after
the war by parties responsible for ob
structing or neglecting the develop
ment of armaments in the face of Ger
many's obvious preparation. Advanc
ed radicals appear to look to the activ
ity in Catholic circles to renovate
their anti-clerical Issue and thus off
set the war issue. The direction tak
en by political movements in France
is so susceptible of unexpected devel
opments that speculation is vague, but
not a few far-seeing men look for mark
ed changes in the next general politi
cal campaign which in the ordinary
course of pvents will take place in the
spring of 1918 when the chamber of
deputies is renewed.

the government good roads Bpeclal
train that is to be in Ottumwa March
29, the providing of club facilities for
the reorganized association were dis
cussed at length and a committee to
suggest a plan of work for the year
was appointed at the organization
meeting of the directors of the Com
mercial club Tuesday.
Officers were elected and numerous
things for the good of the organization
were discussed. Interest and enthu
siasm were plentiful and the meeting
held forth longer than usual.
Considerable time was given to the
discussion of the report of the club
quarters committee and the blue print
submitted without recommendation,
showing how the present location can
be fitted up for a club.
The committee has other locations
in sight and will report on these later.
The' directors continued the commit
tee in power with the instructions to
investigate fully and report them
when through.
A committee of reception that will
meet and have charge of the arrange
ments for the visit of the government
good roads special train on the Rock
Island that is to be in Ottumwa, Wed
nesday, March 29, from 8 to 10

England, J. C. Cooper, A. J. Goss, H. I
G. Anderson and C. H. Smith.
The meeting was full of "pep" and
everyone showed a feeling- of optim
ism. The old plan of having a num-i
ber of standing committees assigned!
to the various activities of the former
association, was abandoned and in
stead the practice in the future will
be to appoint new committees on each
matter that comes up for action and
the idea 1b to give every member of
the club some active work throughout
the year and thus familiarize him with
the purposes of the organization.
