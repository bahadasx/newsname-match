ELBERT H. GARY,
STEEL MAfiNATE
IS INDICTED
Conspiracy to Keep Wngcs Down
Is Charged By Grand Jury in
True Hills, Naming 11 I MM
and Corporations.
rOUNGSTOWN, 0. — Klbort 11.
Geary, president of the United States
Stool Corporation ami 113 other per
sons or corporations have been in
dicted by the Halftoning County Grand
Jury on charges growing out of the
strike and riot at the Youngstown
Sheet and Tube Company on January
7. In that riot four lives were lost,
37 persons were injured and damage
to property amounting to ,000,000
was done. The following companies
also were indicted:
Youngstown Sheet anil Tube Com
pany, Republic Iron and Steel Com
pany, Briar Hill Steel Company and
the Carnegie Steel Company.
The charge is violation of the Valen
tine anti-trust act, a State law, and
conspiracy to keep down wages of
common laborers.
With the indictments the Grand
Jury returned censure for Mayor W. j
H. Cunningham, of East Youngstown;
six members of the East Youngstown
City Council and the police force.
Cunningham and the police are char- j
terized as "inefficient" and unworthy
to hold office."
It was held by the Grand Jury that
no foreign government was responsi
ble for what occurred on January 7.
The indictment is in many ways one
of the most remarkable ever returned
by an American Grand Jury. The fact
that "conspiracy to keep down wages"
is found to be an indictable offense
will doubtless astonish a majority of
capitalists.

SCHWAB BUILDS PALACE
OUT OF WAR PROFITS
Million Dollar Summer Home
Through Sweat of
Slaves.
EBENSBURG, Pa.—The Roman
baths, the unken gardens, cascades,
pergolas, with rich colorings of rare
flowers and all other luxuries and ex
pensive things that will surround
"Immergruen," the new million dol
lar summer home of Charles M.
Schwab, steel magnate, which has been
started here will rival the glory of
any other multi-milionaire's summer
home in America.
The baths encased in plate glass,
will cost ?450,000, many times the
cost of the Roman baths of Lucullus,
the most luxurious Roman of them
all. Schwab probably may walk into
his finished palace July 1, 1917. The
house proper will cost .$250,000, the
gardens, $350,000, and other things
some more. It will be one of the
show places of Pennsylvania.
The site is not far from that orig
inally chosen by Andrew Carnegie
for his Pennsylvania castle.

the discharge of C 2 veteran employes

pany since the enforcement of the
state compensation act.

"dead timber" about the colliery.

(Rip Saw Poet)
The Devil sat l>y the Lake of Fire
On a pile of sulphur kegs,
His head was bowed upon his breast,
His tail between his legs.
A look of shame was on his face—
The sparks dripped from his eyes—
He had sent his resignation to
The throne up in the skies.
"There are others t'tpt outclass me
Hell isn't in it with the lands
That lie along the Rhine;
I'm a has-been and a. piker,
And therefore I resign.
One ammunition maker,
With his bloody shot and shell,
Knows more about damnation
Than all the imps in hell.
Give my job to Kaiser Wilhelm,
Or to the Russian Czar,
Or King George or J. P. Morgan,
Or some such man of war.
I hate to leave the old home,
The spot I love so well,
But I feel that I'm not up to date
In the art of running hell."
And the Devil spit a squirt of steam
At a brimstone bumble-bee,
And muttering said, "I guess I'm fin
ished,
There's no more work for me."

THE BLACK LIST
Every Socialist and Union man
should see the movie play that has
been applauded in every city in which
it has been shown. It is at the Prin
cess Theatre, Sunday, Monday and
Tuesday.
Liebknecht has charged German
capitalists with selling war material
to the enemy through neutral coun
tries. "German soldiers have been
killed by German guns supplied by
Krupps," said Liebknecht, adding,
"You all know how capitalists are in
ternationally related to each other, es
pecially as regards the armament in
dustry.
Phillipp Scheidemann, who was the
chief spokesman of the majority fac
tion of the Socialists in the German
Parliament, who supported the war
credits, has flopped to the minority
faction, which is opposed to granting
further war credits. The party mem
bership in Scheidmann's district, was
almost unanimous in endorsing the
minority faction.
OWNIOI) AND CONTROLLED 15Y THE SOCIALIST PARTY OF SNOIIOMISIf COUNTY
SOME YEARS
AGO AND NOW
By JAMES H. MAURER
Socialist Member Pennsylvania
Legislature.
Some years ago when the Socialists
contended that there were classes in
the United States, a wail of protest
and denial was heard from every city,
village and hamlet in the country.
The capitalists and their defenders
said: "No, in this grand country all
citizens stand equal before the law,"
and that every man had a chance to
be either millionaire, governor or
president. And they p:-oudly pi.ir.tei':
out to us how the tow path boy and
the rail splitter became president,
how newsboys became millionaires,
etc.
This fact should convince us work
ers that if any of us happened not to
be millionaires or presidents, it was
because we were too shiftless, lazy or
stupid. But as the class struggle con
tinued, and day after day became
acute, the lie of "no classes" was
flung to the winds, and war of the
classes declared.
The capitalist class, owning the
means by which we live, and in con
trol of the government, is the ruling
class. On the other hand, we of the
working class, even though in the
great majority and producers of all
wealth, are, and have been through all
ages the subject class.
Labor organization are now, and
have since their inception, struggled
for a higher standard of living, while
organized labor fought glorious battles
for the uplift of their class, and in
cidentally the human race. On the
industrial field, it unfortunately ig
nored the political, and what a fright
ful price we paid and are still paying,
for this indifference or neglect of the
most important weapon.
In our legislative halls, our masters
or their hirelings, make the laws, to
be sure THEIR laws, not OURS.
On the bench sit their judges to in
terpret THEIR laws, not OURS.
They have us build jails to imprison
OUR PEOPLE, not THEIR PEOPLE.
To continue their reign, they organ
ize military companies, recruited from
the ranks of our class. They created
the State Cossacks to crack OUR
HEADS, not THEIRS.
With these government weapons in
their possession, they imprison our
Lawsons, Quintans, and hundreds of
others. With these weapons they
outlawed the boycott and legalized the
black list. It is with these govern
ment weapons that they break our
strikes, starve, crush and murder our
people when we revolt against our op
pressors. With their judicial tools
they plundered the treasuries of labor
unions, and injunctioned the strikers.
The Socialist Party was organized
to capture this governmental tool for
the working class, not for the purpose
of using it as the capitalists do, but
to abolish their system—capitalism —
which i.s based upon labor exploitation,
and in its place establish the co-opera
tive commonwealth. This is the ulti
mate goal we Socialists are striving
for. But while marching on toward
our goal, we help fight the battles of
our class today, tomorrow and the next
day, helping our brothers and sisters
in their industrial struggles.
And whenever Socialists are elected
OVERSEA NEWS
The British Chancellor of the Ex
chequer recently warned the masses
that compulsory thrift is coming.
Then the Lord Chancellor appointed a
new Chancery Judge at a salary of
$30,000 a year.
M. Emilo Cartales, a member of the
International Socialist Bureau, and a
former secretary of the Spanish Social
Democratic party, was recently ar
rested upon his return from Holland,
where he had been visiting by permis
sion of the German army command.
He is accused of having been in com
munication with the Belgian minister,
Mi Variderveide, and Other m'ci.ibers
of the Belgian Socialist party. More
than half of the members of the In
ternational Socialist Bureau are now
imprisoned in Germany and Belgium.

ROME.—General Spingardi, former
minister of war, has challenged Benito
Mussolini, Italy's leading Socialist
editor, to a duel. Mussolini alleged
Spingardi was conspiring to become
commander of the Turin army corps.
George Reed, Socialist, has been
elected to the House of Commons from
the St. Georges district of London,
England. This is the first time a
Socialist has been elected from this
otherwise conservative district. It
was a bye-election.
The trial of Ernest Meyer, editor of
the Berlin Socialist newspaper Vor
waerts, who was charged with inciting
class hatred and disobeying orders of
the military authorities, has ended.
The public prosecutor demanded a
sentence of 18 months' imprisonment.
The court decided, however, that Mey
er could not be sentenced for publish
ing his pamphlet, ;'Who Is Responsi
ble tot th War?", but for the publi
cation of another pamphlet, "The An
nexation Mania." The prisoner was
sentenced to one week's imprisonment.
Desperate rioting in the streets of
Cologne in consequence of the severe
German losses in the assaults on Ver
dun is reported In the Amsterdam
Telegraaf.

to public office, they use their official
positions to protect the interests of
the working class. Even though we
are still in a pitiful minority in our
legislative halls, more obnoxious capi
talist legislation was defeated, and
working class legislation enacted,
since Socialists invaded our legisla
tive bodies, than has been for a cen
tury before.
And it is this progress of the work
ers on the political field, and stubborn
resistance on the industrial field, com
bined with the blind greed of the capi
talists, that is intensifying the strug
gle between the classes, and adding
impetus to the revolution.

CAPITALIST CLASS
IS USELESS AND
DOOMED
Socialism Is the Next Step in the
Freeing of Slaves and the Ad
vancement of Civilization—
Workers Don't Need a Boss.
Modern industry has killed the
skilled mechanic and turned him into
a "hand" tending a machine. It has
likewise killed the capitalist and con
verted him into a vermiform appendix
of the body social. The capitalist
class has become useless and it is
doomed to be eliminated as a ruling
class. Social evolution will give the
wheel of progress another turn and
the capitalist class will disappear like
the feudal ruling class, though with
none of the glory and glamour that
surrounded that class.
Socialism will convert the land,
mills, mines, railroads, steamships,
etc., from private into public or social
property. They will cease to be capi
tal because they will not be used to
rob the labor of any man. They will
be used for the benefit of all who work
and will not be capital any more than
the streets, schools, libraries or post
office are capital. By changing the
ownership from private into social,
the working class will become masters
of the raw materials, machines and of
their own labor-power, and thus the
wealth created by them will belong to
them. The capitalist class, which has
already become useless and exercises
only a paper-right to its property of
labor, will not have to be reckoned
with—it will simply be ignored. If
the individual capitalists will desire to
take part in the socialized labor, they
will be welcomed. We have con
demned their system as a failure and
their class as useless, and we joyfully
proclaim the fact that nothing can
stop the onward march of labor to
ward the socialized ownership and
management of the means of produc
tion and distribution—in short, toward
the Co-operative Commonwealth.

He is coming to Everett with the
very latest exploits of Henry Dubb,
Henrietta and Jr. Dubb.
RYAN WALKER has made an ever
lasting mark for himself in the car
toon world. As a speaker he has had
nothing but words of praise through
out the nation. He is laughing the
Henry Dubbs out of their slavery. He
is showing the way.to freedom. The
old Dubbs may s-tay in their slavery,
but Walker has hopes for the junior
Dubb and out of that lad's mouth and
actions come some mighty good sense
for the working class to absorb.
