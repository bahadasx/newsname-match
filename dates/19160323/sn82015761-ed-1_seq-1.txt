SUPER10RC0URT NOTES
The- M,arch Jury Session of the
Superior Court convened on Mon
day, at 10 o'clock. The first jury
case war the State against Bozeman
and Starkey who were charged with
violating the prohibitory amend
ment. Bozeman was aquittedi and
the jury disagreed on Starkey and
he will have to be tried again., J .E.
Jones represented the defendants.
The case of the .State against A.
d. and Geo. Rounseville was ap
paaled to the Supreme Court from
. an order denying their release on a
writ of habeas corpus. F. D. Crab
ble represented the defendants.
x" The State against Ike Moses was
the -next jury trial. Moses pled
personal use, but the jury retuned
a verdict of guilty. J. E. Jones
represented the defendant.
The case of the State against W.
E. Morgan and Hanford Scott, was
dismissed by. the prosecution. ' A
motion was offered by their attorney
J. E. Jones to dismiss the informa
tion for the reason that . they bad
never been legally committed , by a
magistrate. When the cause came
on for a hearing on the motion it
was found that the certified trans
cript issued by. I. O. T witty, justice
of the peace, had been changed after
it was filed with "the Clerk, and the
words Grand Larceny had been
added. It was not made clear to
the Court who had made the change,
but it was stated by the Clerk" that
the papers were in the possession
of F. O.'Twitty, andC. B. Wilson,
and when returned to him the
change had been made. When J.
E. Jones, offered his motion the
prosecution dismissed presumably
rather then contest the motion and
have the question ot the change investigated."
