Railroads Buy Material for Thousand
Freight Cars Order Must Be
Filled in Three Months.
Portland Lumber mills have been
asked to bid on an order for 8,000,000
feet of trench posts and pickets for
use by the allied powers in the war
zone.
The posts are to be 2x4 inches and
four feet long, sharpened at one end,
and will be used for stringing barbed
wire along the trenchea. They are to
be used on the 'fighting front in
France, and delivery will have to be
made from Portland within 90 days.
This will insure them reaching Europe,
barring marine accidents, by Septem
ber. The order may be for all r part
of the 8,000,000 feet.
A large domestic order for lumber
for railroad cars haa been placed with
the Douglas Fir Lumber company, of
Portland. The order calls for 2,000,-
000 feet of fir. '
The European governments are also
in the Portland market for aa much
high-grade spruce aa can be obtained,
it waa learned on good authority here.
Thia spruce brings $30 to $100 a thou
sand, and la for building areoplanea.
The allies agents for trench posts
have been authorized to ask for bids in
Portland and British Columbia. It is
presumed by local lumbermen, ship
owners and agenta in Portland that
about 4,000,000 feet will betaken
from Portland. The posts would be
cut from Douglaa fir and tied in bun-
dlea of 10 to 20. The coat would be
around $15 to $16 a thousand feet,
bringing to Portland, if the order is
placed here, between $50,000 and $76,
000 for the 4,000,000 feet.
The local river mills could turn out
the order within lesa time than the
specifications now in Portland hands
require. The lumber posts could be
handled easily by two of the large
steamers, and the canal route could be
taken.
The domestic order which has been
placed with the Douglas Fir Lumber
company of Portland calls for 2,000,
000 feet of Douglas fir to bo used in
the construction of 1000 automobile
cars and 500 stock car for the Chicago
& Northwestern railroad. The order
was placed by the Western Steel
Car & Foundry company, of Chicago.
It will take 80 cars to carry it East.
E. B. Hazen, vice president of the
Douglas Fir Lumber company, said that
the order has been put in the hands
of local and Bridal Veil mills and
would be finished in about a week.
The order represents about $50,000.
The European powers, it was estab
lished beyond reasonable doubt, are ac
tually seeking large spruce orders in
the Pacific Northwest, principally Ore
gon. Local lumbermen admit that
they were unable to fill the orders as
fast as they were being received. The
spruce required is of a fine grade and
brings from $30 to 1100 a thousand
feet. In the last two years about 10,
000,000 feet has been taken out of the
Northwest for the construction of
aeroplanes for the European powers.
This confirmation lends considerable
credence to the report from Marshfiled
that the Russian government was seek
ing 60,000,000 of spruce in the Coos
Bay country.
Blame Denied by Berlin.
Berlin No German submarine could
have been in the vicinity of the spot
where the Dutch liner Tubantia was
sunk, and no German mines had been
laid in this region, the German ad
miralty announces. The official state
ment says: "A German submarine is
out of the question in connection with
the sinking of the Tubantia, as the
place where the accident took place is
less than SO miles from the Dutch
coast, which means that this place is
within the territory declared to be not
dangerous for shipping by the mani
festo of February 4, 1915."
Auto Kills Bridal Pair.
Dubuque, Iowa, T. J. Fitzpatrick,
an attorney, and nis Dnoe or two

ret Morrison, mother of the young wo
man, and Mrs. David Hack, daughter
of President Gorman, of the Rock
Island railroad, were injured when
their automobile left the road and fell

The occupants were pined under the

have lost control of the machine. I
ENGLAND PUTS BAN
ON MANY LUXURIES
Strict Council Order Due Soon
to Relieve Shipping.
IMPORTS FROM U. S. TO BE CURTAILED
All Space in Vessels Now Needed for
Necessities Autos, Musical
Instruments, Cutlery, Hit.
London A far-reaching order in
council, which will totally prohibit im
portation into the United Kingdom of
a large number of articles which come
under the general heading of luxuries,
will be issued by the British govern
ment at an early date.
Among the things which will be
placed under the ban will be automo
biles for private use, musical instru
ment, cutlery of all kinds, hardware,
yarns, china ware, fancy goods and
soaps. The order will apply equally to
all countries, including the British
dominions and colonies.
This forecast of the coming order in
council waa given to the Associated
Press Saturday by Walter Runciman.
president of the board of trade. Mr.
Runciman admitted that articles in ad
dition to those named would be placed
on the list of prohibited imports. He
declared it waa absolutely necessary to
limit the shipment of bulky luxuries
to provide room on ships for necessar
ies. "But please remember," said Mr.
Runciman, "that the issuance of this
order is forced on the country not as
a matter of policy, but entirely be
cause of shortage in tonnage. We
want exports from the United States;
we want your wheat, cotton and meat,
ana we need other things which we
cannot get if the space aboard vessels
is taken up with luxuries.
"Everything possible is being done
to relieve the shortage in ships. Every
ship flying the British flag is now con
trolled by the government. Immense
numbers of them have been requisi
tioned. Others are subject to direc
tion by way of license. Whether it
will be necessary to requisition more
vessels I cannot say, but for my part I
nope that thia will not be done."
Mr. Runciman said the importation
of some fresh fruits probably would be
prohibited later, but he pointed out
that this would affect the United
States only slightly. Turning from
the matter of imports to the general
industrial situation in the British
Isles, Mr. Runciman said there never
had been greater activity in the larger
industries, that wages were higher
than ever before, and that the percent
age of unemployment never had been
so small in the history of the country,
$40,000 a Day Is Cost of
.Pursuit of Mexican Bandit Villa
El Paso, Tex. The United Statfes'
pursuit of Villa, under present ar
rangements, is costing the government
$40,000 a day, according to estimates
made here Saturday by army officers.
Carranza officials, it was learned.
have been discussing with some con
cern whether American troops during
the Villa pursuit would have to occupy
any Mexican cities and the effect of
such occupation on Mexican public sen
timent. The Carranza officers have
frankly expressed the hope that the
garrisoning of the cities can be left to
their own troops.
The American army s choice of the
Chihuahua desert as its place of entry
precludes for the present such a prob
lem as city garrison duty.
Stolen Bill Used in Spain.
New York A United States govern
ment $10,000 gold note, one of 20 of
the same denomination stolen from the
mail in September 1912, on the way to
New York from Havana, Cuba, was
received Saturday by a bank in this
city, from the American Bank of Mad
rid, Spain. It was the ninth of the
stolen notes to reappear since the
theft. Aa the notes appear they are
given to the insurance company which
paid insurance covering the amount of

Hen Lays IOOO Eggs.
Corvallis, Ore. "Oregona," a White
Leghorn hen at the Agricultural Col
lege, has laid her thousandth egg.
'This," said Professor Dryden, "is
the greatest long-distance trap-nest
record ever known to the world." At
the end of her fifth year the hen. had
laid 987 eggs. She has now laid, at
the beginning of her sixth year, the 13
necessary to make her a 1000-egg hen.
Formerly it was believed the domestic
hen could not lay over 600 eggs.
CARRANZA fORCES NOW MAKING
SUPREME EffORT TO CAPTURE VILLA
Washington, D. C. While there
were indications in official dispatchei
from Mexico Wednesday that the de
facto government was making a su-
preme effort to capture Villa and his
bandits with its own forces, there was
no sign that General Funston's orders
to proceed on the same errand had
been modified in any way.
Word that American troops had
crossed the border was still lacking,
the War department itself not having
been advised as to when the movement
would begin.
Congress took active notice of the
border situation for the first time. The
house adopted a resolution late in the
day authorizing the recruiting of the
mobile regular army to full strength.
This means the addition of approxi
mately ZU.UUU fighting men to the in-

fantry, cavalry and field artillery. The
senate is expected to concur, and the
necessary orders will be issued imme
diately to fill up regiments on border
duty.
The step was suggested by the army
general staff. It is urgently desired
now, because of the weakening of the
border force by the expedition after
Villa, but ever since the patrol of the
border began the army has been great
ly handicapped by the skeleton organ
ization of regiments, companies,
troops and batteries. The force that
occupied Vera Cruz had similar diffi
culties, some of the companies there
being less than 40 men strong.
U. S. Troops Will March Into
Mexico in Light Order
Columbus, N. M. The commanding
officers of the expeditionary force
gave orders Wednesday that the men
should take with them only such equip
ment as they could carry on their
backs or saddles. Extra clothing and
the equipment known in the army as
the "surplus kit" will be left behind.
These orders were intended to limit
carrying facilities to the essentials of
the expedition food and drink for
the men and horses and ammunition
for the guns.
Large quantities of ammunition for
the mountain howitzers and held guns
has been distributed. Cabmat wa
gons, which carry ammunition for the
soldiers' rifles, were loaded and the en
gineers, signal and hospital corps were
supplied with the final details of their
equipment.
New Hands Like Claws.
Paris Two new types of artificial
arms with hands are shown at the
Academy of Sciences, One is for
heavy work, with fingers like claws of
a lobster. The other has artificial fin
gers, enabling the hand to reproduce
closely the action of natural fingers.
Successful experiments were made in
the presence of members of the acad
emy by two men, each of whom lost an
arm. One sawed through a beam of
wood and the other played a violin.
Army of 120,000 Proposed.
Washington, D. C. Chairman Hay,
of the house military committee, Wed
nesday prepared for immediate intro
duction of the resolution to permit the
President to raise the fighting
strength of the standing army to 120,
000 men at once.
Republicans and Democrats worked
in perfect harmony for the adoption of
the resolution, depsite that fact that
their leardera on the military commit
tee disagreed as to the meaning of it.

VILLA CHASE BEGUN;
MEN CROSS BORDER
Gen. Pershing and Army Start
South After Bandits.
CARRANZA MEN JOIN AMERICAN fORCE
Orders Are to "Wipe Out. Villa and
His Organization" Other En
gagements Are Expected.
San Antonio, Tex. General John J.
Pershing, with more than 4000 troops,
began the pursuit into Mexico Thurs
day of Francisco Villa. General
Pershing's report that he and his com
mand had crossed the international
boundary line just south of - Columbus
reached General Funston here. Re
ports of progress in the country where
the search haa been begun will be
made by General Pershing to General
Funston, but it is not expected these
will be frequent or deal with any bat
the more important development.
Colonel George A- Dodd, heading a
smaller column that entered Mexico
some distance west of Columbus, also
is moving in a southerly direction and
these two forces should be within
touch of each other before many days.
By that time it is expected an infantry
support will hold the line of commun
cation along which motor trucks for
the transportation of ammunition and
supplies will be operated.
General Pershing's report of hie en
trance into Mexico served to dispel to
a great extent fears that had been en
tertained in some quarters that resist
ance would be offered by the troops of
the de facto government. Colonel Ber
tani, the commanding officer of the
Carranza garrison at Palomas, on the
gouth side of the line, joined General
Persihng.

but they were reported to have dis

to join in the chase.
As a body the Mexican troops will
remain under their own commander.
but several of them are being employ
ed as scouts by General Pershing.
General Pershing haa gone into Mex
ico with orders to wipe out Villa and
his organization. Unless orders to the
contrary are received from those high
er in authority than General Funston,
the campaign that haa now begun will
continue until Villa is captured or
killed. No limits have been placed on
the field of operations.
Douglas, Ariz. Numerous reports
reached the United States mili
tary authorities here Thursday that
open rebellion haa broken out among
the Carranza troops at Cabullona, 18
miles south of here. Americans here
are seriously disturbed.
Submarines and Aeroplanes
Within 1 5 Days, Says Edison
Washington, D. C Thomas A. Edi
son told the house naval committee
Thursday that with a fully equipped
Federal research laboratory with f acil-'
ities for standardization, machine
parts of submarines and aeroplanes
should be built in 15 days. He said
the United States should appropriate
liberally for such a laboratory as rec
ommended by the naval advisory board
of civilian expert.
The government could distribute
standardized parts to manufacturers,
the inventor said. The Federal lab
oratory, he said, could be put in full
working operation for $1,500,000.
When Mr. Edison . concluded, the
committee formally expressed its
thanks, rose and remained standing as
he left.
Howard E. Coffin, of Detroit, a
member of the naval advisory board,
who followed Mr. Edison, said that
mobilization of industries to help in .
time of war waa of greater impor
tance than buiding ships or recruiting
men.
Mr. Coffin opposed secrecy in work
ing out preparedness plans.
"Let us get this Becrecy bunk out of
our heads," he said.' ' "There proba
bly isn't a foreign country which does
not know all about our resources."
.Priest Settles Strike.
Souix City, la. Accepting the ad
vice of Rev. George J. Jonaitis, pastor
of St. Anthony's Catholic church, . of
Omaha, and Strike Leader Edward
Payne, strikers of the Cudahy packing
plant are to return to work at once.
The decision marked the settlement of
the third strike within three weeks.
The four discharged employes of the
Cudahy plant, who caused the last
walkout, will be taken back by the
company.
