Since the World took up the matter
of boosting for a county fair for Bam.
my county, we have had many words
of encouragement, and several farm
ers have expressed their opinion in
favor of a fair. There was recently
organized at Bismarck an Association
of County Fairs of North Dakota, and
B. E. Groom of Langdon was made
president, and Mr. Flint of Bismarck,
secretary.
We have just received a letter from
"Mr. Groom, and while he says in this
letter that he does not care to be
-quoted, his letter will be of so much
Interest to the people, of this county,
that we do not believe that he will
make any strenuous objection if we
publish it, and therefore we are going
to take the chances:
L. ngdon, N. D., March 19, 1916.
Editor Crary,
Devils Lake, N. D.
Dear Sir: In recent issues of the
World I notice that you are undertak
ing to do some boosting for a county
fair for Bamsey county. You un
doubtedly noticed that we recently had
a meeting at Fargo of the secretaries
of the fair associatiins of the state
and organized Association of County
Fairs of N. D. Mr. Flint of Bismarck
is the secretary, and the real head of
the organization. I was named as
president but that doesn't amount to
anything as in this fair business the
secretary has the work.
I wish you had a good fair there at
the Lake, our trouble hs been that it is
hard to run a lone show and make it
as good as it could be made if there
were more county fairs. This fair at
Langdon has proved good and the as
sociation now has property worth at
least $10,000 and we are clear of debt
and have some pretty good fairs.^ It
is supported in part by county aid.
That is, we figure on county aid to
pay premiums and build buildings.
Nothing of that fund goes to amuse
ments. This suits the public pretty
well and is generally regarded as a
legitimate expenditure of county funds
and the fair is certainly boosting the
stock business in the county as well as
other lines.
This new association is anxious to
help any other county get organized
if there is a demand for a fair and
would try and help line it up along
lines that would insure its success
and make it a permanent institution.
Mr. Flint, myself or any other fair
manager in the state would willingly
meet with your people and talk this
over with them if there is any demand
for a fair and do what we could to
help get it started.
I know nothing further of the sit
uation at Devils Lake other than pre
sented in the World, but would think
that Bamsey county could easily
maintain an excellent county fair.
I would like to have you take this
matter up with Mr. Flint and see if
anything can be worked out for an or
ganization.
Mr. F'int and myself are soon going
to get out a letter for general publi
cation along this line and present
some of the reasons why a good fair
can and should be maintained in more
of the counties of the state, and will
see to it that a copy goes to you.
I don't care to be quoted on this
matter as yet but if there is anything
that can be done from here to help
you get started will be mighty glad to
do what I can.
Yours very truly,
B. E. Groom.
FIRE DESTROYS
BELCHER HOME
Last Saturday the home of George
Belcher of Minnewaukan township,
was totally destroyed by fire togeth
er with all its contents. At the time
of the fire Mr. Belcher was in Devils
Lake and Mrs. Belcher and children
barely escaped, but were unable to
save anything. How the fire started
is unknown. It is reported that the
insurance had recently expired, and
therefore the loss will be a heavy one
to Mr. Belcher. Until arrangements
are made for another home the fam
ily are now with the M. J. Belcher
family of Lake township.

Editor Devils Lake Inter-Ocean and
World, Devils Lake, N. D.
Dear Editor: I read with much in
terest the article in your late issue re
lative to my sermon a week ago last
Sunday evening at the court house.
Inasmuch as it was signed, Post No.
33, G. A. R., I asBume that the article
was sanctioned by that body. I there
fore beg leave by your courtesy to. an
swer thru your honored colums.
I am accused by the author of this
article of characterizing every soldier
who fought in the late Civil War as a
"murderer and a devil." The author
even intimates that I would and did
place even those who sleep beneath the
sod in the same category of "murder
ers and devils". The indictment is
hardly worth an answer to anyone who
heard the sermon. I suppose the au
thor drew the inference, and it is only
an inference, from my statement that
the Quakers believe that the shooting
of a fellow man upon the field of bat
tle is legalized murder and a direct
disobedience of the specific command
of God, "thou shalt .not kiil." My
critic may also have drawn his infer
ence from my statement, that the war
across the seas was wholesale murder
With all due respect to my critic and
to the G. A. R., Post, whom I sincerely
respect, I must insist that this cause
less war does so appeal to me. But
to call every soldier in this war, many
of whom are Christian men, by the
ugly name of "murderers and devils"
is a manifest perversion of the truth.
Many of them are actuated by the
same lofty conception of Christian
duty as actuated the boys in blue who
back in '61 left office, and shop, and
plow and marched away to the south,
many of them never to march north
again.
I Even tho the war across the seas is
wholesale murder as it must appeal to
every Christian man, yet no one would
be justified in characterizing either
the soldiers across the seas or those
in the late Civil
(War
As long as I am a disciple of Jesus
Christ I shall believe that war '.s
wrong inherently, fundamentally
wrong, as wrong as slavery, piracy, or
the dueling system. Indeed war is the
duelling system with nations instead
of individuals as the principles. And
farther with the light that I have now
I am still fartehr convinced that the
world will never do away with war by
preparing for war, any more than the
world will ever do away with theft
by preparing people to commit theft,
or do away with murder by very care
fully and with the most scientific
methods, teaching men how to commit
murder, or do away with drinking
whiskey by teaching them to drink
whiskey. We do the things that we
prepare ourselves to do. 200 years
ago many good people believed and
practiced duelling. In deed in those
days a man who would not fight a duel
when challenged was stigmatized as a
coward and ostracised from society.
But individual duelling is a thing of
the past and I am convinced that in 20
years from now international duelling
will be a thing of the past. If three
fourths of the people of every nation
refused to bear arms every interna
tional difficulty would be amicably set
tled, just as we settle our individual
difficulties by resorting to the courts
instead of borrowing horse-pistols and
counting off 15 paces and commencing
to pump lead into each other.
Just a word now in regard to what
the critic of my sermon is pleased to
call in one place "my nonsensical rap
sodies" and in another place "my id
iotic twaddle." Those who heard my
Sunday evening sermon will remember
that the entire discourse which my
critic calls "nonsensical rapsodies and
twaddle' was ah exposition and appli
cation of the teachings of Jesus Christ
found in the latter part of the 5th
chapter of the book of Mathew. Those
teachings of the Christ are as follows:
"Ye have heard that it hath been said
an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
tooth. But I say unto you that you
resist not evil. If any man shall strike
you on the one cheek turn to him the
other also. If any man shall sue at
the law and take away thy coat let

as murderers.
Murder is a condition and motive of
the soul. Jesus said: "He that ha
teth his brother in his heart is a mur
derer." If my critic has ever felt in
his heart hatred toward a brother then
at that time, according to the Christ
he was a murderer, just as I would be
a murderer if I felt the slightest re
sentment toward the one who penned
the article in severe criticism of my
peace sermon.
him have the cloak also. You have
heard that it hath been said love your
friends and hate your enemies. But I
say unto you love your enemies.
Do good to those that hate you." The
plain teaching of the entire passage
is that we as Christians are obliged to
return good for evil and kindness for
hate. Every man who listened to this
sermon, which is characterized as
"nonsensical twaddle" will bear me out
in the statement that the entire ser
mon was the application of those
teachings of Christ to individuals, to
communities, to churches, to corpora
tions and to nations. For 2,0(0 years
the world, growning beneath the aw
ful burden of miseries and disolation
of war, has been waiting for our
Christian statesmen to apply these
teachings of the Christ to the interna
tional relationship between nations.
When they are applied war will cease.
These specific teachings of the Christ
and their direct application to the
problem of war is what the commen
tator on last Sunday's sermon is pleas
ed to characterize as "nonsensical rap
sodies" and "idiotic twaddle". I am
inclined to think that there is not a
few Christian people in Devils Lake
of both Catholic and Protestant per
suasion who would not agree with this
self constituted critic that these teach
ings of Christ are "nonsensical rapso
dies." However, if this hostile critic
of my peace sermon, is convinced that
Jesus was teaching "nonsensical rap
sodies" and "idiotic twaddle" when He
lay down these principles to guide ail
Christians, then it is equally evident
that his quarrel is not with me but
with the author of these teachings,
Jesus Christ. Let this brawny brain
ed critic go directly to Headquarters
and hurl his choice oratorical emula
tions of "nonsensical rapsodies" ami
idiotic twaddle" (whatever that is) at
the Christ and not at me. Let this
self appointed critic who is afraid to
sign his name, but sneaks out of sight
behind an honorable and much loved
institution, come out into the open and
either prove that I did not in my Sun
day night sermon correctly interpret
and apply these teachings of Christ:
"Thou shalt return good for evil",
"love you enemies", "fight hate w'ih
love", or else let him boldly declare
that Jesus was a teacher of "nonsen
sical rapsodies" and "idiotic twaddle".
I have always felt as a Christian man
and a teacher of the Gospel that it
was my business to preach the Gospel
and not mend it. If Jesus made mis
takes let my critic go and set Him
right. It is hardly in accordance with
the American spirit of a fair deal to
blame me because Jesus was a "non
sensical rapsodist." I utterly disclaim
all responsibility for the "idiotic twad
dle" that Jesus taught. In the mean
time until I receive fresh orders fi
the skies, in spite of all hostile criti
cism, I shall continue to preach and
try to live this same "idiotic twaddle"
and I have a sneaking suspician that
when this same "idiotic twaddle is ap
plied to the relationship between na
tions that all wars will cease. 'Nuf
sed.
Praying that the richest and choic
est benediction may rest upon the G.
A. R. post of your city and every ex
soldier throughout the republic, I beg
to remain,
Sincerely yours,
R. Carleton.

INTER-OCEAT
JOHN WILLIS ARRESTED ON
WARRANT SWORN OUT BY MIS
SOURI PEN OFFICIALS.
HABEAS CORPUS INSTITUTED
IDENTIFICATION MARKS ON
PERSON DO NOT AGREE WITH
PRISON RECORDS.
Minot N. D., March 22.—John Willis
who has been conducting a restaurant
in this city for something like three
years, was arrested yesterday on a
warrant charging him with being an
escaped convict. Following his arrest
he employed Attorney D. C. Green
leaf, who instituted habeas corpus pro
ceedings and a fight will be made to
prevent his being taken back to Mis
souri from the penitentiary of which
state he is charged with having es
caped ten years ago, while serving a
life sentence for murder.
The warrant was sworn out by J. A.
Harden, assistant yardmaster at the
Missouri penitentiary. The hearing
will come up on the habeas corpus pro.
ceedings when the officials asking for
his return to Missouri have time to
get whatever evidence they desire to
present.
The litigation involves some inter
esting things. The Bertillion system
of identification is largely what the
officials are relying to identify the man
whom they claim escaped from the
penitentiary in 1906. At that time
there was no reliable thumb prints
and some of the special marks of iden
tification recorded in the description
which Mr. Hardin has with him, do not
agree exactly with those of the pris
oner. The other side contends that
these changes are only due to the dif
ference in the age of the man when
they were -recorded and now.
Willis, the officials claim, was sen
tenced to ninety-nine years in the Mis
souri penitentiary for murder and es
caped shortly after he began serving
his sentence. He was sentenced under
the name of Franklin.
HINTS ON TREE PRUNING.
Commence pruning the trees from
the top and finish at the bottom.
Make every cut as close and parallel
to the trunk as possible.
Your saw must be well set and
sharp in order to make the cut per
fectly smooth.
Leave no stubs, dead and dying
wood or fungus covered branches be
hind you.
Do not fail to cover every wound
with coal tar, not allowing it needless
ly to run down the trunk.
Do not remove several large branch
es on one tree at a time. They must
be removed gradually, the work ex
tending over a period of several sea
sons.
Prevent tearing the bark off the tree
in removing large limbs by first mak
ing an "undercut."
Make the cuts on a slant. Some
trees, like the elm, sycamore, linden,
and willow, will stand the process of
"heading back" more than others, and
the poplar is a tree that must be cut
back every few years to keep its crown
from becoming too tall and unsafe.

SALE OF LAND
STATE SCHOOL FUND INCREAS
ED NEARLY HALF MILLION AC
CORDING TO STATEMENT.
Bismarck, N. D., March 21.—Nearly
half million dollars was realized by the
state school land fund through the
sale of lands in Cass, Sargent, Rich
land, Steel and Walsh counties, Ac
cording to a statement made today by
Frank S. Henry, state land commis
sioner.
Mr. Henry, who personally conduct
ed the sales, announces that total re
ceipts in the sale of 16,745.82 acres to
be $483,009.80,and a feature that
makes the success of the sales more
significant is the fact that the lands
were the poorest of the state school
properties in the several counties and
had at various times been previously
offered for sale, bidSj however, up to
the appraised value never having been
received.
All told, there now remain only 4,
200 acres of unsold state school lands
in the Red River Valley counties in
dicated.
Cass Co., acreage sold 3,992.87, to
tal receipts $142,710.00, average per
acre $35.71
Walsh, acreage sold 1,272.68, total
receipts $32,242.10, average per acre,
$26.00
Steele, acreage sold 1,760.00, total re
ceipts $64,360.00, average per acre
$36.56.
Richland acreage sold 6,283.76, to
tal receipts 147,243.45, average per
acre $23.43.
Sargent acreage sold, 3,431.52, total
receipts, $96,454.25, average per acre
$28.10.
Totals 16,745.82, $483,009.80 $28.10.
A signileant feature, so far as the
counties interested are concerned, is
the faet that all of this land just sold
will be added to the tax rolls of the
current year, and will add materially
to the revenues of such counties.
The highest average value of land
sold was in Steele county, while the
highest price paid for any tract was
in Sargent where $53 an acre was
paid.
The last public school land sale to
be held this year is in Burleigh coun
ay when on March 24, a total of 22,
000 acres will be auctioned off.
