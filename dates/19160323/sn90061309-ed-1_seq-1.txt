city, every citizen
as individuals
tins shown an interest in the move-
inent and proffers their support and
co-operation.
In the past three or four years
our Citizens have not been dissat
isfied but rather waiting until we,
ourselves, in a public spirited way
accomplish something that would
at least justify us in this request.
The improvements in the past
three years stands as a memorial
that does not require printers ink to
-advertise. So as indicative to the
statements just made we may say
that;
Whom so ever is satisfied with
what he does has reached his cul
minating point; he will progress no
more; Man's destiny is to be not
dissatisfied but forever unsatisfied
The Citizens and business men of
our City feel that the interests of
this community, in a manner, are
with those of the Burlington identi
cal. In the past we have had the
Station and mil road accommada
tions consistent with the growth of
the City and the interests justify
ing the Burlington rail roads but
in the progress of 'he past few years
in improvements, agricultural and
commercial developments we feel
that this shall not be our culminat
ing point.
The inconveniences of this Old
Relic of a Station and the general
appearances that it offers to a vis
itor or a stranger who perchance
might get off of the C B & Q here
in daylight, would prompt him to
go on to a place like Shelbina and
have his folks meet him there.
We Must have a new Station utid
we have faith in the business judge
ment and the co-operative spirit of
the Officials of the Burlington rail
road, and feel nssureJ that our po
sition is well taken and our request
should be granted.

Organ Recital.
On Thursday evening March 23rd
OI "le, "PPears on a program,
Prof' Johnson is a musician of wide
reputation and ability. The fact
that he plays the organ at The
Cuthedrul of St. John in Quincy
sufficiently recommends him. He
will demonstrate the powers of a
pipe organ as a few of us have
ever heard it done. We are expect
ing a large crowd at the Recital, so
we advise that you come early and
get a good seat. You cannot afford
to miss a single number on the pro
gram. There are no charges for
admittance to this entertainment
but we shall ask for a silver offer
ing to help pay the expenses of the
program. On behalf of our Organ
Committee in behalf of our Church
I extend to vou all a most cordial
invitation to attend the musical
treat. Sam P. Gott, Pastor.
Well Pleased.
The concert at the High School
Auditorium Friday evening proved
to be u rule treat to the music
lovers of this city. Miss Eva Egertou,
soprano, and Miss Edna Gockel
Gussen, pianist were both urtists
and it is not often that this city
has the privilege of hearing such
splendid talent. That Monroe City
enjoyed this cencert was due to
Miss Murgurite Reid, who single
handed and alone sold enough
tickets to pay the expenses. She
did this that you and I might enjoy
really good music. How many of
us would take such a responsibility?
She canvassed the town knowing
that she would only make expenses.
She deserves the credit of giving
this city one ot the best musical
programs it has ever had.

Ad-
vertisera
Every week some one Is disap
pointed when they get their paper,
in not seeing something there that
they expected to see.
There are several reasons for this:,
jst. The Editor may not know
0f the item of news, whici. you ex-.
peCed to see, if you did not tell :
him (or her) or send it in. It is.
impossible for the editor to get the
news for the ordinary weekly paper
without the help of the people. Wc
have tried it and know where
of we speak.
2nd. The Item may not have
been sent in, in time. Every week,
not only in this office, we have
worked in several offices and it is
the same story, valuable and im
portant news items are left on the
copy hook because of a lack of
time for setting the item in type.
Take into consideration the fact
that every word in this paper is set
one letter at a time, and that it re
quires six days of hard work to get
out a paper such as this, and you
can readily see that, the sooner
that news item is handed in. the
more assurance you have of seeing
it in print.
This paper is printed every Wed
nesday afternoon and if all who
have items for publication mai
and send them in Tuesday or Wed
nesday, it is absolutely impossible
for the compositors to set it all in
type ana get tne paper out on
time, and as we must come out on
time something has to be left out.
A word to our advertisers:
It is a well known fact that no
progressive business man, today
will try to run his business without
advertising it. than a banker would
try to run a bank without money.
As before stated in this article it
is impossible for the compositors t j
set all the type for the paper in 1
day It is also impossible for the
printer to set all the ads for the
paper, and give you a nice ad. if
your copy for ad conies in late. The
up-to date printer designs his "ad"
same as the architect does his
building, to make up an ad tn.it
will attract the eye of the reader
and produce the desired result
Glance over the puptr. note the
number of 'ads" in its columns
then bear in mind that the printer
has to set up all these ads, "make
up" 8 pages of the paper and spend
4 hours in press work, all ordiuari -
ly between Monday and Wednes-
day night, and you can readily see
ll all our advertisers uo not nana
I ' tllt,ir uu,il Tuesday or Wed-
neB(1"y '"""img, -he printer has to
lnrnw lne,n wgeinei any way to gel
them up in time to print, and your
ad cannot have the attention it
should have.
If our readers who have items
and our advertisers will get their
copy to us on Mondays and never
later than Tuesday night, the com
positors will have their copy book
cleaned up, ready for any items of
interest that transpires on Wed
nesday, and the printer can give
your ad the proper attention, and
we know you will be more than
pleased with the results. Try it a
while and be convinced.'
Yours for more prosperity,
EF. Bobon.

Ready to Cooperate
Last Saturday afternoon commit
tees from each of the three clubs
the P. E. O's . the U D. Cs. and the
Century Club met to discuss the
possibility of those organizations
being any aid to the new project
getting a new Burlington Station.
It was decided at that session that
the clubs would endorse anything
the Commercial Club may do fur
this object and help in any definite
way these gentlemen may suggest.
Petitions have been given the
ladies to sign which with oilier
petitions and resolutions will be
sent at once to the directors of the
C. B. & Q. R. R It is to be hoped
that the time is ripe and public
sentiment strong enough to cul 'in
nate in a plea which will cause the
erection ol a new building of which
the Burlington officials and the citi
zens of Monroe City will be duly
prouo. "
