He was an accomplished schol

He had, without ostentation,

He was a devout man, rigid in

AN APPRECIATION OP THE REV.
L. E. JONES.
The Greenville Ministerial As
sociation is called upon to mourn
the loss of a faithful member.
'or a number of years one of the
most active members of this as
sociation was the Rev.L. E. Jones.
He was not only a charter mem
ber, but also a prime mover in its
organization, and, for many years,
its secretary, until the infirmities
of advancing age made it impos
sible for him longer to attend its
sessions, jn e vertheless his inter
est in the association and its work
and members lever waned.
Amid all the changes in pas
torates which the- exigencies of
time and church polity occasion
ed, he remained as a link to the
past and earned the regard of
our members by his regular at
tendance, faithful participation
and careful records.
During his active membership,
he was prompt, willing, conscien
tious in service, strong in con
viction, friendly in criticism, con
servative of the best, hopeful for
the future.
While his interest was primar
ily in the Presbyterian church o;
this city, of which he was pastor
years ago and where he worship
ped so long, yet he was interest'
ed in all the churches of the city
and pleased to leam of their pro
gress. Not being a pastor of a
congregation for aiong period of
time, his interests broadened to
the whole religious life of this
community. i
Our friend has I fallen asleep
and we pay our respects to his
memory and record our apprecia
tion of his life and services, both
in this community and in this as
sociation. . ,."(
After a long life here he enters
upDn the enjoyment of a life in
the presence of the Lord Jesus,
whom he believed'and served.

in the Lord from henceforth; yea,

Avoid Spring Colds.
Sudden changes, high winds,
shifting seasons cajise colds and
grippe,' and these spring colds are
annoyine and dangerous and are
likely to turn inco a chronic sum
mer cough. In such cases take
a treatment of Dr. King's New
Discovery, a pleasant Laxative
Tar Syrup. It soothes the cough,
checks the cold and helps break
up an attack of grippe. It's al
ready prepared, no mixing or
fussing. Just ask your druggist the removal of Samuel Hill, in

Spring began today with a
pretty low temperature. Think
by the time the Villa trouble in
Mexico becomes settled we will
have warmer weather. Yet this
is not saying that Villa is giving
dispensations of weather. No, I
think it better logic to say the
ground hog is. a dispenser of wea
ther about this time of year. But
thanks that the ground hog dis
position is about to end, and from
the experience we have had his
hogship has been no mean wea
ther prcgnosticator. We have
had six weeks of real wintry wea
ther, and may we hope we are
near the end of it. But some say
we need not expect much warm
weather until after Easter, and
if that is true, we will have a
considerable installment of cold
weather yet, as Easter comes
very late this year. In fact, as
ate as is possible under the rule
governing this movable festival.
One thing I think we may well
rely upon and that is we may
surely expect much warm weath
er before Easter. It always comes
AFTER.
