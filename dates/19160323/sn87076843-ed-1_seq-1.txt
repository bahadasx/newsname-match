On Thursday afternoon last
John Bowers, 40, of Chicago, at
tempted to criminally assault Miss
Ida Finch, a 17-year-old girl.
Bowers, who had been driving a
dray here, quit his job and was in
the Harper hotel, where he board
ed. During the temporary absence
of the landlady, and while the girl
was alone in the kitchen, Bowers
attacked her. She fought him with
all her strength and was able to
defend herself until help, attract
ed by her screams, arrived, and
Bowers fled.
He was caught by citizens and
placed in jail. To avoid a possible
demonstration against him he was
given a hearing that evening be
fore Justice Cook, who bound him
over to court and he was taken to
the county jail.
The girl was not seriously in
jured, although roughly treated
by Bowers.
SMUT CAUSES LOSS IN OAT CROP.
Oat yields in Ohio can in most cases
be increased at least 5 per cent if
farmers treat their seed oats for smut,
is the opinion of J. G. Humbert, as
sistant botanist at the Ohio Agricul
tural Experiment Station. Because of
the unusually wet season last year
many farmers secured increased yields
of 10 to 20 per cent by spending a
few hours in treating their seed just
previous to planting time. In all tests
the results at the Experiment Station
show that the increase in yield has
paid the farmer well for time so spent:
One pint of 40 per cent formalde
hyde, or so-called formalin, to 40
gallons of water is recommended for
40 to 45 bushels of grain. The oats
are spread on canvas or a clean floor
and moistened thoroughly with the
liquid. Any sprinkler may be used
while the oats are shoveled over. After
being covered with a blanket over
night, the grain is spread out and
shoveled over frequently until dry
enough to 'sow. Grain sacks and the
drill should be treated with the same
formalin solution.
TIME LOST IN PLOWING GROUND,
FOR OATS AND CLEANING
THE SEED. .
Does it pay to plow ground for oats
and to clean the seed for this crop?
These questions are answered by F.
A. Welton, associate agronomist of the
Ohio Experiment Station, in the Febru
ary Monthly Bulletin, in which he says
that farmers are frequently misled
by such practices. Six years' results
at the Experiment Station show that
disked land has given greater yields
J than plowed soil, and the cost of pre
paring the seed bed has been much
less. The only objection to disking is
on land where weeds are unusually
abundant or on exceptionally heavy
clay soil.
Cleaning seed oats to remove all the
small grains has likewise been unprof
itable. Yields are increased so slightly
by repeated cleaning of the oats in a
fanning mill that Mr. Welton advises
only the removal of dirt, broken
straw and weed seeds in the grain.

Superintendent Cole Writes of
Conditions in Schools.
To the Pntrons o the Perrysburg
School:
It is with regret that I leave the
Perrysburg School. I have given
of my very best during the two
years that I have been here to
make the schools the very best I
could possibly make it. When
I saw a weakness in the system I
tried to strengthen it there, even
though in so doing I knew I would
run into opposition. I am very
sensitive to adverse criticism, so
the people of Pcrrysburg can feel
very sure that when I opposed the
wishes of a great many, that it was
only that I felt it my duty in the
position I held. The easy way for
me would have been to run along
the lines of least resistance. But
I feel that some' time the results
will be felt in the school.

SCOUT NOTES
Edited by the Perrysburg Troop
of Boy Scouts.
Last Saturday morning ten
Scouts, led by their Assistant
Scoutmaster, took a hike in order
to get in trim for the longer hikes
in the spring. The boys went out
west of Maumee to the Wabash
railroad and went up the track
until they came to a large woods.
Here they stopped as it was about
j 11 :30, and proceeded to get din
ner. Under the supervision of
Donald Pheley, the boys gathered
' wood and built a lire. Some of the
' boys had ham and bacon, potatoes,
' beans, sardines and cookies. This
was divided among the hungry
1 bunch, and after every one had
' gotten warm, the fire was extin
guished and the boys started north
to the river. They came out at
Turkey Foot Rock, read the sign,
had their pictures snapped and
then, as they were beginning to be
tired, they started for home, ar
riving at 1 :45, tired, but ready for
a much longer hike in a few weeks.
Mr. Cole, Donald Canfield and
Edmund Schuster attended the
Scoutmasters' dinner at the Y. W.
C. A. on Wednesday evening.
The boys of our troop are the
most downhearted lot of young
sters since it was learned that Mr.
Cole is going to leave. They real
ize that it was only by the per
sistent efforts of Mr. Cole that a
Boy Scout troop was formed here.
In order to show their appreciation
they are going to dig into Scout
work and make this troop a bigger
and better organization, so when
Mr. Cole returns for a visit he will
r find that all his hard work has not
been in vain.
' Mr. Hartshorn has been made
Scoutmaster, with Ed Schuster and
Don Canfield first and second as
sistants, respectively.
, Scouts Chas. Braun Jr. and Ray
mond Launan have been very ill
with tonsilitis.
HIGH SCHOOL NOTES.
The Leap Year party held last
Tuesday evening was a huge suc
cess. The two comedies staged by
the Dramatic Club were good. The
dramatic work shows a wonderful
improvement over last year.
Spring vacation begins March
31st.
One of our High School boys,
speaking to Mr. Cole concerning
an entertainment: "Mr. Cole,
don't you think it would be nice
to have a quartet of about four
members?"
The Dramatic Club is rehearsing
daily for "Engaged by Wednes
day," which is to be given soon.
The literary societies will have
thoir annual oratorical contest the
latter part of April.

In tho Perrysburg Journal, issue
of March 2nd, the Board of Educa
tion promised to submit statements
covering every important feature
if the proposed improvement.
The Journal issues of March 9th
and 16th were watched for with
much interest by many, who ex
pected to see soino of the promised
statements. But instead of a single
statement along this line they set
up the usual sympathy cry of:
""Are the children of any other
place better than tho children of
Perrysburg?" "Do others deserve
better conditions around them
than your children?" (Simply the
sympathy act.)
Now we do not believe this pro
posed bond issue will -over carry in
this way, as ,the people of Perrys
burg want to know the truth and
all of the truth and nothing but the
truth in the whole transaction.
We want to know why you advo
cate upwards of $30,000 for one
large school building when you
know, if you have given the matter
one-half of the time and study that
you claim you have, that the cot
tage plan is the most up-to-date
and the most practical, for several
reasons :
First A building large enough
to take care of tho present over
congestion can be built for from
five to ten thousand dollars.
Second Others can be added as
required.
Third Each can be supplied
with individual heating systems at
small cost.
Fourth In case of contagious
diseases the whole school is not ex
posed. Fifth In case of fire the whole
school is not endangered.
Sixth This building can be con
structed and paid for in three or
five years, and thereby not burden
the taxpayers with thirty or forty
thousand dollars' interest, as it
was suggested to issue upwards of
forty thousand dollars in bonds
and not start to pay them for ten
years. (
Any schoolboy can figure that
this issue at 5 per cent for ten
years is twenty thousand dollars'
interest.
Before you commence to pay the
bonds off, this interest alone would

THIS OLDEST DANK IN -VQOD COUNTY
The C. II. & D. R. R. Co. arc re
ported as making plans to erect a
freight depot which they plan to
place on Louisiana avenue be
tween tlie present passenger sta
tion and the Chas. L. Koch Co.'s
building. By this action it would
seem the railroad company are do- r
termined to show their unfriendli
ness toward the village by placing
their proposed freight house where
it will bo as unsightly as possible,
as well as to make removal of
freight from the cars to the house
as difficult and subject to as much
damage to freight as possible.
Evidently the railroad company
don't love Perrysburg. Perhaps
Perrysburg will be able to find
some manner of showing her good
will ( ?) for the railroad company
in return for their kindness.
Well, Spring came on Monday
afternoon, but she was clothed in
winter garments of beautiful snow.
Winter's flirtation with Spring is
becoming scandalous.'
For many years Toledo
"talked" about building a new
Cherry street bridge. For years
they fought over the contract.
Then for some more years they
wrangled with the contractor.
Again some years they were build
ing the bridge, and now the con
tractors claim $6,000 due. Here
are more years for scrap. What
a queer old town it really is.
Mr. C. O. Cummings of Tontog
any has announced his candidacy
for the office of County Commis
sioner. Mr. Cummings resides in
territory that has been a political
desert for many years, and as he
has all the necessary qualifications
for 'a capable commissioner, there
seems to be reason for him to have
hope of landing safely.
The jury failed to agree in tho
case of ex-Mayor Keller of Toledo,
tried for accepting a bribe. It is
reported as being 11 to 1 for con
viction. But what's the use? Why
make an example of ono who may
have accepted, instead of him who
is supposed to have offered tho
bribe?
