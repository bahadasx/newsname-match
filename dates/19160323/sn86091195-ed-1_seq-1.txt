OFFICIAL PAPER OF BLACKFOOT CITY AND BINGHAM CO., IDA.
VOL. IX. NO. 17
BLACKFOOT. BINGHAM COUNTY, IDAHO, THURSDAY. MARCH 23,1916
$2.00 PER YEAR
REQUESTED TO
RESIGN OFFICE
George H. Holbrook, county auditor,
yesterday resigned his office and the
county commissioners will meet next
Monday to hear applications before ap
pointing his successor. Fred Fisher,
who has been a faithful, competent
deputy under Mr. Holbrook, seems to
be the logical appointee, as he under
stands the requirements of the office
( better than anyone else and is capable
of conducting it with satisfaction to
its patrons and the 'taxpayers. Aside
from his clerical ability he is a trust
worthy and reliable man, and the coun
ty commissioners will make no mistake
in appointing him to fill the vacancy
in the auditor's office.
Mr. Holbrook left for California last
night and will join his wife and family
in San Diego.
The many friends of Fred Fisher are
circulating a petition to have the coun
ty commissioners appoint him county
auditor, and it is being very readily
and liberally signed by all who know
Mr. Fisher as a competent and honor
able applicant for the appointment.
We are told that Wm. Danielson started
a petition; but later withdrew it.
BLACKFOOT AGAIN DUPED
Sperry, the drunken sheet metal
worker has skipped out and left a large
number of creditors who mourn Iub de
parture and their confidence in human
nature. Although a comparative strang
er he secured sufficient credit to start
a promising business and had more
work given him than he could handle.
But he codldn't keep sober even in a
"dry" town where the "temper
ance" concoctions not only produce
intoxication, but permanently incapaci
tate a man who gets a few of them un
der his belt. Sperry got hold of a
brand df these temperance beverages
that not only made him neglect his
business and friends, but with the aid
of a cigarette almost transformed his
drunken couch into a crematory, and if
it had not been for the interference
of the night police he would have had
less creditors to regret his departure.
He claims to be a railroad engineer
and was last heard from at Armsted,
where he is traveling about the state
on an engineer's pass. He assigned the
few traps he left in his shop to Attor
ney Beaklev, who had them removed
last Monday.
Mr. Beakley states he not only fur
nished him with legal advice, but ad
vanced him cash to carry on his work.
Blackfoot of late has been cursed with
this character of deadbeats, and as long
as they are allowed to come and go
without any police interference thev
will continue to make this city the
mecea for their deceitful and fraudu
lent practices.

GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE
HERE
D. W. Davis, the American Falls
banker-farmer and a very promising
candidate for the Republican nomina
tion for governor at the approaching
election, was in Blackfoot between
trains last Monday meeting old and
making new acquaintances. He Btates
that he is meeting with more encourage
ment than he expeeted, and appears to
be very optimistic in his gubernatorial
aspirations. George K. Crum of Lewis
ton, Idaho, seems to be Mr. Davis' only
opponent, but as he is practically un
known in Blackfoot and vicinity, and
Mr. Davis being very popular here, the
Lewiston candidate is not much heard
of. However, a few Republican lead
ers of Blackfoot while admitting Mr.
Davis' many qualifications for the
gubernatorial toga, favor the northern
man on account of the division of party
recognition, claiming that the office of
governor should go to a northern man.
Just w T hy the northern part of the
state is entitled to that honor the
average voter does not know and can
not understand why the state should
be divided by an imaginary line for
political purposes that have no bear
ings on an honest, economical govern
ment. Every governor of Idaho for
the past twenty years has been a
resident of Boise or vicinity, regardless
of politics, and why a governor from
any other part of the state would be a
benefit to the state or its tax-ridden
citizens we do not know. It matters
little wh.ere the candidate comes from
if he is an honorable, capable and
truthful citizen from whom the voters
can expect an honest, businesslike ad
ministration of state affairs, and it
matters less what part of the state is
fortunate enough to possess such guber
natorial timber. The candidate for
governor should be the choice of the
whole state as well ns the servant of
the whole state, which should not be
divided by party lines for political or
personal motives. Let the people choose
theiisgovernor and if they make a mis
take in that choice they cannot fare
worse than they have in the past, where
the governors have been selected by
political machines that have been a
curse to the state. If the Republican
candidate for governor is defeated nt
the next election it will be because
the Republican voters who voted for
Alexander two years ago have not for
gotten the criminal condition of their
party machine when they beat Haines
for his appointees' dishonesty, which
he exposed too soon for his own politi
cal benefit.

Mr. Duckworth appeared before the
council in behalf of the city getting a
Carnegie library and said that if it

cil in regard to the maintainance of a

Pony Boys Must Hustle
These are the harvest days for pony
votes. Are .you working! You will
never have a better chance to win. Do
not let a day slip by. Do not wait
until tomorrow or next day, but keep
light on hustling. Get right after your
friends and line them up to save pony
votes for you.
Explain to them how pony votes are
to be had and how to get them. You
will be surprised how many votes you
can roll up by persistant effort. Your
friends and neighbors will have to trade
somewhere and it will cost them no
more to trade at the Pony Stores and
save votes for you. It is not hard to
gather up Pony Votes. Just take a
"ginger pill and matte a special effort
during the remainder of the campaign.
People will admire your earnest
work and help you when they see you
are determined to win. Bear in mind
that the only way you can secure a
gold watch or the pony' outfit is to go
out among your friends and get them
to trade where they can secure the
vote tiekets and then call and get the
votes of them. Every child is going to
have a square deal and an equal chance
to secure a prize. There will be no
special vote day's, no deviation from the
regular schedule and no favors shown.
If you have not already won a watch it
is no indication that you will not have
enough votes to win the pony outfit nt
the end of the campaign. No one can
tell who the winner will be until the
end and you might be right near tin
top of the list, so keep right in the
game until the finish, and if you should
not win—go down with your flag flying.

"THE BIRTH OF A NATION.'
"The Birth of A Nation." which,
with its superb and inspiring musical
setting, rendered complete by a sym
phony orchestra, its bewildering sound
and light and color effects, will be
presented in Blackfoot two days, start
ing Monday, March 27th.
Hietraric scenes are depicted with
realistic effect, ranging from battle
engagements, such as the battle of
Gettysburg, the seige of Petersburg,
Sherman's march to the sea and the
fall of Atlanta, to events in Washing
ton.
In the pictures Gen. Robert E. Lee
strides forth to clasp the hand of Gen.
U. 8. Grant, his conqueror at Appoma
tox. Another historical event of last
ing impressiveness is the assassination
of President Abraham Lincoln, present
ed as accurately as the details are
remembered by eye witnesses and as
exact reproduction of the playhouse in
which the martvred president lost his
life.
Peace is exemplified in a brilliantly
impressive pageant and the pictorial
story continues with the fortunes of
the re-united lovers and the troubles
experienced in the south over the abuse
of political power vested in the imunei
pated negros. Mob violence and out
lawry are depicted, followed by- spectac
ular view of the Ku Klux Klansmen
who organized secretly to control the
negros through their superstitious fears.
The Klansmen were fearless night rid
ers and they wore white sliroudN. Acts
of vengeance were perpetrated under
the cover of darkness and the pictures
show clearly why such extreme meas
ures were necessary for the continuance
of law and order.
In point of interest the Klansmen
spectacles rival the war aspects of the
graphic photoplay.—adv.
Case Affirmed
Attorney Good has been notified by
the Supreme Court that the ease of
the State vs. Swan Berg has been af
firmed. In this case th. defendant was
convicted iu the probate and district
courts of obstructing the public high
way and fined $100, from which con
victions he appealed to the Supreme
Court.

comie reels and bushels of fun. The

Pony outfit, an Elgin Gold Watch or
a season ticket to the Isis theatre.
Bad Check Artist Captured
Wm. Morgan, a young man about 20
years of age, is in durance vile for
making purchases with bad checks. He
operated in Blackfoot to the tune of
$65 which he distributed quite evenly
between three merchants who, when
they found they had been duped, round
ed him up and delivered him to the
sheriff for safe keeping. He hails from
Sterling where he is credited with pas
sing^ a bad check or trço. He is said
to b'e a farm hand, and his crookedness
was discovered by the attempted pur
chase of a horse from Jas. Martin. The
Golden Rule, the Kinney Mercantile,
and Rowles & McCosham are the firms
lie fleeced. He acknowledged being a
forgerer and was bound over to the dis
triet court.

POLITICAL DECAPITATION

made known this week when the
gubernatorial axe fell on the heads of
two State institutions. The two de
capitated officials are J. T. Humphries
of the Industrial Training School nt
St. Anthony, and Dr. Givens of the
Orolino Insane Asylum. What the
doctor's sins of ommission or commis
sion are has not yet been made public,
but a criminal familiarity with th■■
girls of the St. Anthony school that has
been prolific of native born inmates,
has caused thy vacancy there.

FREE PUBLIC
LIBRARY ASSURED
Definite plans are at last made for
a public library for Blackfoot. Many
other towns in the state, some much
smaller than Blnckfoot, have had their
libraries for years, and we are terribly
behind in many matters of civic im
provement.
When we say public library, we mean
a library, not for the town people on
ly, but for the people living in the
country ns well. The ladies Club, The
Current Event Club and V. I. 8. have
long considered this matter, and have
finally got it under way. Considerable
help has been pledged this good work.
The King's Daughters, under the lead
ership of Mrs. William A. Lee, have
voted to give $75.00 and their help.
The Boy Scouts and tneir leader, Mr.
Beaver, were kind enough to put iu the
shelves. The P. K. O. have offered
help, and private individuals have given
books. The ladies will be glad of help
from any other organization, church or
lodge.
The proposition is in the hands of the
library board, who have completed
plans for securing books both by soli
citing and buying. Supplies have been
sent for.
A book social will be given at the
club rooms on April 15th, nt which re
freshments will be served. The price of
admission will be a book or a silver
offering to nid in buying a book.
A sensorship committee has been
appointed to pass on the books before
they are indexed. If you have any
books you do not want to keep, which
you will give, phone or give them to
Mrs. Powers or Mrs. Neil Boyle.
The ladies hope to place the small
library in good condition, and will be
ready to turn all books and supplies
over, when the proposed Carnngie lib
rary shall be a certainty.
Surprise Forty
A number of the friends of Joseph
Scofield gave him a surprise party at
his home Tuesday evening. Among
those present were Mr. and Mrs. O.
Buchanan, Mr. and Mrs. R. H. Clayton,
Miss Ida Chapman, Miss Leorna Jor
den, Miss Hazel Wright and Clifford
Robertson. The evening was spent in
lancing nml playing games, after which
dainty refreshments were served. Mr.
Scofield will leave on a mission next
week.

for the past several years, died at his
home Thursday morning at 6 o 'clock,
of dropsy anil leakage of tho heart. Ho
was 40 years of age, and born iu 8alt
Lake City, Utah, in 1876. He leaves
a wife and five children to mourn his
leath.

Miss Katie DeKay entertained twelve
of her girl friends last Saturday after
noon at her home on Ash street. Cards
were the chief amusement of the after
noon, the prizes being won by Miss
Phyllis Hoover and Miss Marian C'hub
buck. Dainty refreshments were serv

Viewing Our City Hall
The mayor and city council of Mont
pelier were in Blackfoot Inst Sunday
making an official visit for the purpose
of viewing our city improvements, not
ably our city hall. They were also in
terested in getting some information re
lative to a municipal power plant for
their city.
