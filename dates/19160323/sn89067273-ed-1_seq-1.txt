Tom Cook Meets
Sudden Death
Is .Shot to Death Sunday Night by
Howard Smith in Genrich's
Restaurant.
Tom Cook, 25 years old, noted po
lice character often before the
courts on different charges went In
to' J. A. Genrich's restaurant Sunday
night, evidently looking for trouble.
According to witnesses he was noisy
and boisterous. Howard Smith, one
of the waiters, ordered him out of the
restaurant. E. H. Gowan, in charge
of the restaurant with Smith, also
asked Cook to leave the building.
But he daringly remained. It ap
pears that he finally asked for a
drink of cider, but he was refused.
He was under the influence of alco
hol. At this point he picked up a
mustard bottle and began to move to
ard Smith. Smith reached under the
counter for a revolver and shot Cook
in the region of the heart. Cook then
ran out the door and fell in the gut
ter at the curbing of the street a
dead man.
Coroner Strode the next day called
the following jury to investigate the
matter: Herbert Q.) Plunkett, Bert
Sims, Roy Pearl, Wm. Frazler, R. T.
Carter and C. H. Hamilton.
Their verdict was as follows: "We,
the jury in this case, find that Tom
Cook came to his death by a gunshot
wound, said gun being in the hands
of Hftward Smith. We also find that
.Smith had been . threatened by Tom
Cook and r that , he shot in self
defense." -
Sweet charity assisted in giving
the body proper burial. . .

and a noble Christian character.
Resolved,, That Trinity Auxiliary
extend heartfelt sympathy to the be
reaved husband and daughter and
all relatives and friends of deceased.

unto me all ye that labor and are
heavy laden and I will give you rest."

and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
For my yoke is easy and my burden
is light." Matthew 11:28-29-30.
Resolved, That a copy of these res
olutions be sent to her husband, her
mother and to the Mexico papers.
