W. P. GRAFF IS
A CANDIDATE FOR
STATE_SENATOR
We are reliably informed that
Wilbur P. Graff has consented to
become a candidate for State Sen
ator for the thirty-seventh district,
comprising the two counties, Indi
i ana and Jefferson. It is unques
tionably an indication that clean
| polities appeals to one's judgment
when men. like Mr. Graff are will
ing to lay aside their business to
] assume the duties of office. He is
;one of Indiana county's successful
I business men, and it is surely at
| more than ordinary sacrifice on
; his part that he has consented to
! become a candidate for senator.
We therefore congratulate the
people of the thirty-seventh dis
trict in being so fortunate as to
have a man of this character look
after their interests at Harrisburg
He is held in high regard by his
friends as a business adviser, his
judgment being as good as a guar
antee.
He has been unusually success
ful in his various business enter
prises and will, if elected, make an
able senator. —Leechburg Advance
