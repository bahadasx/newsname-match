BIG BUT FROSTY

the Control of the Managing Committees.
Tho Wilson meeting at tho Audi
torium was an awful frost.
Whether a meotlng is held for
War,
Peace, or
Politics,
The principal Ingredient necessary
to make It a success is
Enthusiasm.
This was absolutely lacking at Mon
day night's gathering.
Tho President as usual, was
Dignified,
Eloquent and
Able.
His grent speech delivered without
notes was a masterpiece of rhetoric.
Yet tho great speech was unap
preciated. Homo good men In the audience
worked themselves Into n frenzy of
applause.
Dut they wore few and far between
and resembled
Open wuter
In a field of floating Ico.
Tho reason for this was not hard
to discover.
Instead of tho meeting being hold
under the warm-bloodod auspices of
Democracy or Republicanism It was
held under tho auspices of a soulless
corporation, without a charter, callod
Tho Industrial Club.
Now tho Industrial Club has somo
good men In It.
Not many,
Because that would bo Impossible.
It nan not many members all told.
Dut It is a handy club to belong to,
because, llko tho Irish Fellowship
Club, It has no dues and no hall rent.
It gives two banquets to itself overy
ear, and several of tho mombers are
sufficiently acquainted to know each
other It their autos collided by mis
take. Tho National Democratic Commit
teeman, The Democratic Stato Central Com
mitteemen, Tho local Committeemen,
Were not invited and, Judging from
tho fact that most of the nudlenco
was made up of Republican office
holders ami Republican ofllco-seekers,
they were not wanted.
Ninety per cent of tho audlenco
wero thoro from motives of curiosity,
.That Is why our great president was
only cheered for fifty-five seconds
by tho watch when ho appeared.
It was tho lurgeBt applause given
him during tho night.
Thero 1b such a thing as over-playing
this nou-pnrtlsan game,
Tho follows who engineered the
WilBon mooting overplayed it.
Tho Red nioodod Democracy of Chi

They wero not given a chance.
