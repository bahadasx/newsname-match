The Opelousas Sugar Refinery,
which was sold by local owners to
Crockett & Weil, of Alexandria, a
few weeks ago, will be operated
during the fall, according to an
nouncement made by the pur
k chasers
The Opelousas sugar refinery
Bwas ereacted two years ago at a
cost of some $75,000 -and was oper
4 ated but a short while; due to the
`lack of capital, and other misfor
:mtunes the local people had to close
down the mill. Realizing that if
Q:the refinery could be operated this
parish would derive untold bene
fitts, the owners of the concern, did
inot hesitate to sacrifice the big
sugar mill, which stands on the
Beanet plantation, a few miles out
of town, for $10,000 to Crockett &
Weil.
The new owners of the Opelou
.aas sugar refinery have started a
<crew of mechanics to work in an
iendeavor to have the entire plant
e' enovated and repaired in time for
the sugar crop. Farmers around
Opelousas are being urged to in
crease their cane acreage as there
will be a profitable market for this
p next fall.
,The firm of Crockett & Weil has
a enviable reputation for honesty
ktd fair dealings. With headquar
,ers at Alexandria this firm has
en making headway in business
:fr the past several years. The
jarmers of this section have no
az e to believe that in the event
increase their cane acreage
wey ill be compelled to sacrifice

oalings and it is to their interest

predictions are that cane will

MISSISSIPPI EXPECTED TO
REACH RECORD STAGE
Engineers Think That Levees Will
Easily Withstand Water Mark
of 1912
Baton Rouge, La.: High water, but
not necessarily an alarming state
of water, is expected to flow down
the Mississippi, according to Joe
Monget, of the state board of en
gineers, who has been in Baton
Rouge, for the past several days
looking after some of the levees in
his district.
"We are going to ?have high wa
ter," said Mr. Monget. The river,
so far as I know, was never known,
this early to have so much water
or to reach so high a stage. The
levees, however, are in good shape,
and can stand the water of 1912
without difficulty."
Mr. Monget has been carefully
over the Baton Rouge levees and
regards th/em as in splendid shape
to withstand any volumn of water
that can reasonably be expected to
come down the river.
The Yazoo and Mississippi Valley
Road has the contract for keeping
most of the Baton Rouge levees in
condition and the road has a large
number of men at work for the
past month strengthening the
week places.
OBIER OPENS OFFICE
WITH LITTELL-LA~ULER
Prominent Youi, A:fcrney Takes
Up New Quarters to Practice
His Profession
W. Prentiss Obier, prominent
young attorney, who recently ven
tured into the practice of his pro
fession, has taken quarters in the
offices of Littell & Lawler, real es
tate dealers. Mr. Obier is regarded
as a promising attorney and enjoys
a large circle of friends, who are
looking forward to his ultimate
success as a lawyer.
The youngest attorney in St.
Landry is willing at all times to
assist his friends who are in legal
trouble and he asks them to step
around at the Littell & Lawler
building, where he will immedi
ately attend to their wants.
POPULAR ORATOR TO BE
HERE ON WEDNESDAY
Peter Collins Will Lecture on
"What's Wrong With the
World ?"
Peter Collins, one of the foremost
popu.lar orators of the United
S;tates, will appear in this city ofr
a second time and will deliver a
lecture on "Wat's Wrong With the
World?" on next Wednesday night
at 8 o'clock at the Knights of Co
lumbus Hail.
Mr. Collins was here, it is remem
bered, about two years ago, when
he made a hit on his talk against
Socialism. The house on that night
vas crowded to its fullest capacity.
T! would not be surprising to see
the big K. of C. hall overflowering
with spectators on the night of
February 9th. The local Knights
under whose auspices Mr. Collins
appears here, are putting forth
every effort to make Mr. Collin's
tay here as enjoyable as possible
and it is hoped that the citizens
of Opelousas will turn out en
masse to hear Mr. Collins.
The committee on arrangements
urge the people to come early so
as to be sure to secure good seats.
Thei'e wil be no admission fee,
the lecture being given free of
charge..
'court to have the Bellevtle box re
opened and a ballot marked spoil
ed, on account of one party voting
for four candidates for the legis
lature, be counted, in which event
it is expected Mr. Mills would be
declared elected by one vote.
VWhile the race for agsessor is
not creating much excitement-at
least not as much as the recent con
test for sheriff, it is nevertheless
expected that a large vote will be
cast on the 29th of this month.
The voters of St. Landry should
turn out en masse to express their
preference for assessor and there
is certainly no reason why a' prac
tically full vote should not be cast
at the second primary election.
CADDO PARISH MAY VOTE
ON LIQUOR QUESTION
Election of Wet Police Jury In
Caddo Parish Revives the
Story that Test is Coming
Prohibition Caddo has elected a
wet police jury; Caddo is the home
of the two gubernatorial candidates
on the Democratic tocket in the re
cent campaign. It has been in the
"dry" column for several years, and
every attempt to call another elec
tion has proven futile.
The anti-prohibitionists feel as
sured that in the event another
election would be held to decide the
liquor question Caddo would "come
back. home" in the good old "wet"
column.
A few days after the election a
reporter of the Shreveport Times
penned the following:
. Already there is much talk of
programs and the like. But the
leaders on both sides are actually
mum. Those who would like
Shreveport an open town and the
blind tigers put out of liusiness by
the licensed and regulated saloon,
are predicting a local option elec
tion before the summer is over.
Others who favor the existing
status have gone the antis one bet
ter, and declare it is not at all im
probable that the present police
jury, which is of strong pro predic
tions, will take the political play
away and order a local option elec
tion befor ethe antis can organize
and prepare for the contest.
That Caddo voters are destined to
be called upon to settle the liquor
question once more is certain, from
reports fluttering in from the North
Louisiana metropolis, and it would
not, therefore, be surprising to see
the Caddo police jury call an elec
tion within the next few months.
CITY MAY GET CHATAUQUA
Through the efforts of several
business men of this community
Opelousas may-get a Redpath C'
tauqua during the early part of
May.
While Opelousas has never wit
nessed a chatauqua, it is the pur
pose of the people of this city to
see whether one will be as popular
here as in other cities. The pro
moters of the chatauqua promise
the people of this city the most in
teresting chatauqua ever brought
down this section of the state.
In next week's issue of the Clat
ion it is probable that a definite
announcement will be made as to
the proposed chatauqua.

Sheriff-elect Lee Wiggins, of

a worthy young man as Lee Wig

While the people of Opelousas
had nothing against the present in

naturally hoped to see Lee Wiggins

THE WOMAN'S CLUB
The last regular meeting of the
Opelousas Woman's Club was with,
Mrs. Easthain, Jan. 22nd.
The subject for the afternoon
was Ralph Waldo Emerson, with
Mrs. Saizan as leader. Mrs. Saizan
read a paper which showed thor
ough preparation and a close study
of the poet's life and his style in
poetry. This paper was very in
teresting and instructing to all,
since most of us knew very little of
Emerson as a poet, but knew him
only as an essayist. After the read
ing of her paper the leader had
three of Emerson's short poems
read: "To the Rhodoro," "A Fable,"
and "The Problem.' The leader was
very wise in the selection of these
poems as each one shows a distinc
tively different style and class of
poetry. After the reading and dis
cussion of these poems a very inter
esting round table discussion last
ed for half an hour. The critic
then gave her report. Miss Dupre
said before making her criticism
that she would not criticise the
program just rendered but would
review some of Emerson's works
which hdd not been mentioned dur
ing the program, and in doing this
she compared his works with the
works of other poets of his time
This review was very interesting
and instructive, and showed that
the critic herself was familiar with
Emerson (a poet who is so little
read and understood) and his po
etic style.
The next" meeting of this club
will be with Mrs. Fielder, Satur
day, Feb. 5th.

after an illness of several weeks.
The news of Mr. Thompson's
death came as a shock to his
friends and children who, had only
a day before received the glad
tidings that he was steadily im
proving.
Mr. Thompson was a native of
Opelousas, being born here over
65 years ago. He was the son of

ALEXANDRIA IS SCENE
OF iORRIBLE TRAGEDY
Mrs. Dan E. Mann, Member of
Prominent Jewish Family Shot
Down by Insane
The most horrible tragedy that
ever occurred in Alexandria took
place at 9 o'clock Saturday morn
ing, when Mrs. Dan E. Mann, wif3
of a prominent dry goods merchant,
was shot and killed and her little
6 year-old daughter, Regina, -was
wounded by Bryan David, a young
man, who is supposed to have sud
denly gope insane. David suicided
a few niinutes after the deed, by
swallowing an ounce of carbolic
acid.
David resided in Wichita Falls,
Texas, and was visiting rela
tives. He had been acting queerly
several days. On Saturday morn
ing he went down town and bought
carbolic acid and returned home.
He fired one shot at his Fthree year
old nephew, Stafford Lawrence,
missing him. He then left the Law
rence residence' and stopped in sev
eral homes in the nedhborhood iq
nuiring if any Jews lived in them.
He asked if there were any He
brews in the neighborhood and was
directed to the Mann residence. He
rang the door b~ll and the little 6
year-old girl opened the door for
him.
He fired a shot through her ab
domen, walked into Mrs. Mann's
bedroom and fired two shots into
her body. David left the house and
was seen to swallow the acid as .he
left. He was taken to a sanitarium
but died as he reaced there. Little
Regina is in the sanitaritum in a
critical condition. =
Mrs. Mann was buried on Sunday
afternoon at 3:30 o'clock. She was
a member of a prominent Jewish
family and is well known in this
city.
tendent of; the St. Landry public
schools.
"Big Jack," as he was familiarly
known, did more for the public
schools of this parish than any of
his predecessors; he took charge of
the affairs of the schools when this
parish was probably the most illit
erate in the state, when there were
but two or three high schools and
built up the schools on the pres
ent 'high standard.
Mr. Thompson did some valua
ble work in community uplift; he
instigated the move for the
electric light and water plant; he
organized the Opelousas Compress
Company and various other enter
prises and at the time of his death
was promoting the Opelousas Petro
leum and Gas Company, which 'was
to bore for oil in the Mallet neigh
borhood.
The deceased was always num
bered among the most progressive
citizens of this parish; he always
stood for whatever move, whidh
meant the advancement of the com
munity, financially and socially and
in his death Opelousas and St. Lan
dry lost a valuable :citizen.
The funeral ceremonies were per
formed at the Thompson home on:
Union street and interment made in i
the Protestant cemetery, where
Preacher Spilliard implored the
blessing of God upon the departed
man. Several hundred friends of
the Thompson family paid their
last respects to the deecased,: by
attending the funearl and inter
ment.
MANAGER DENIES THAT
CLAIBORNE WILL BOLT
Lecoq Puts to Rest Rumors Con
cerning Ferd Claiborne's: Flop
ping to the Bull Mosers -
It now appears certain that Ferd
C. Claiborne,' one of the defeated
candidates for lieutenant governor,
will not bolt the Democratic party.
For the past week politibal wisea
ores have been kept guessing as to
what course the Pointe Coupeq
statesman would pursue, as he: had
promised to tell the people of Lou
isiana what, he had seen in New:Or
leans on the day of the Democratic
primary.
Mr. Claiborne did not cast his
vote in the Democratic primary and
for that reason it was supposed that
he would side witch John M. Parker,
the Bull Moose: candidate for gov
ernor. It was even hinted at that
Mr. Claiborne would offer himself
as a candidate for lieutenant gov
ernor on an independent platform.
Conrad Lecoq, campaign mana
ger of Ferd C. Claiborne, gave out
the following statement on Monday
afternoon, which was printed in
the New Orleans press:
"I understand that rumors have
been circulated to the effect that
Mr. Claiborne contemplated per
mitting his name to be used as a
candidate in the coming general
election, on the Progressive ticket;
also that he may run as an inde
pendent in the election.
"I wish to deny these reports
most emphatically. Mr. Claiborne
has no such intention, and under
no circumstances will he permit the
use of his nanme."
