Appeals to Debtors.
Fora long time past Dr. Charl
es M. Freeman of Metuchen, N.
i., has been most modestly con
n cent to be known as the hus
e band of Mrs. Mary E. WVillint
3 Freeman, noted' short story
e writer and novelist. But there
r Is now evidence that when it
comes to ingenuity of idea arid
t iterary skill, the doctor can ring
the gong himself.
On the death of his father,
Manning Freeman, he fell heir to
a coal and lumber business of
long standing. Everybody iº.
Metuchen knows him and he
knows everybody in Metuchen.
He is genial and not until the oth
er day, when the current num- i
oer of the Metucheoi Recorder, a
weekly; came to their eyes, had
they any notion that Doctor Free
man had been toting for some
time a secret woe and that, per
naps, a cynical distrustiyf some
of his long-time townsfolk had
begun to sear his heast.
In the middle of the first page
of the home weekly in big black
type were splattered these riu
m orals:
$67,653.38.
And below, the good doctor
enbosom-d. himself to all Metu
chen. He had this'to say: s
"At this time of the year it
occurs to us to sjiulate OQ- 1
cerning the actual definition o'f
the word business ss unddrsrood
by the intelligent people of tjils
borough.'
"it is the general belief in doy
sane community that no businedb
I is conducted merely for the ple s
ure of so doing, with no regard
I whatever to a just percentage of
profit. We are loath to believe
that the conclusion to which W,
are forced comes with the'appro-"
bation and voluntary action of
the people of Metucheu~ They
have always seethed to utranrd
.seem now to rack wtell Armo$
the people of other boroughs. -
"We fail to credit- what seems
the evidence of our senses that
they deliberately plan to avoid
a just indebtedness.
"We asstme that the stAt .
ment Which we are abbut to make.
will 4-ome as a shock to the hon
est SAd well-intentioned people
in our midst and-that- they wil
promptly'set about remedying
the coidition of affairs.
"On' January 1 there was due
as from the peoi:le of Metuchen

id4es that they had no such idea
that my books for January 1 had
I- *huwn me such a devil of a NE w
Year', present, that any such
- iwrdiament-had cropped up be
- cause they weren't paying their
- lebts.
"The 'ad' has brought in $2,
).), of the back money already,
and I'm confident there's much
au, re to come. You see, it was
.ýL a matter of figuring that I
mril a lot of money and that my
wife's literary efforts brought
h.-r a lot of money and they'd
ijust pay. ussome time or other;
In that way of thinking tney sur
•eeded in putting me $67,00
is the hole.
"So I'm mighty glad I took
t'iem into my confidence, and I
a u more certain-than, ever th t
he people .of Metuchen are all
r.ght. I They just didn't know
chat they had been doing to me?
I'I have heard but one criticism
,f my public letter, and that
~romi a man who didn't owe me
3 cent. But he said he didn't like
:y doing a thing like that. PBr
:iaps beciuse he hadn't thought
of itfirst" - .
If.a butiness man can colloect
de'inguent accounts through tLe
e 'lumns of a newspaper why can
iot ppblishers themselves use
s 4cse t" good advantage" in a
s milarfi.anner? Almost every
