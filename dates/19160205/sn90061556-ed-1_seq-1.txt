ATALEOFOLD JAPAN
Prof. Work and Chorus Big Feature
at "Y."
Do Credit to S. Coleridge Taylor's
Music.
By CHARLES A. STAIIKS.
Last Friday evening, January 28,
saw the big "Y's" auditorium enjoy
ing what every theater manager and
manipulator of playing cards like to
see frequently a full house.
It was an evening with Coleridge
Taylor, the late African-English com
poser. "A Tale of Old Japan" was
the vehicle in which Prof. ,F. J. Work
and his augmented chorus of gruelled
voices were gracefully riding. One
would have thought the crowd was
strictly cosmopolitan. Not on your
life, It was rather a conglomeration
of kinds. Music, you know, Is no re
specter of persons or classes, and
there were some persons there who
were no respecters of music. There
were a couple of feminine chatter
boxes who sat directly In front of
the writer who persisted In plying
their gossip genius to his discomfiture
and others In that vicinity of the
house. Other than this, all went well
with the audience.
The program came so very near
PROF. FREDERICK J. WORK.
Musical director in Lincoln High
School, who successfully produced
Coleridge Taylor's "In Old Japan"
at the Y. M. C. A. last week.
starting on time that we close our
eyes and give them 100 per cent cred
it. The first part of the program fea
tured a symposium of local stars.
First, "Imaginary Scenes," by Miss
Beulah Douglass; second, "Selected"
by Miss Effie Grant thl;rd, "I'm Trou
bled" and "Steal Away," by Prof. R.
G. Jackson; fourth, "Deep River" by
Master .Maceo Williams. The audi
ence took especially to this last num
ber by our local violinist. The execu
tion was masterly and happy, the
young artist carried his effusion into
such exquisite notes that seemed to
melt ,and die away Into the great un
known. What a power!
The second part: "A Tale of Old
Japan."
All public entertainments should
have as a basic purpose the educat
ing ot the whole community. There
is no asset that can be more advan
tageously added to a people's knowl
edge than the appreciation of good
music. Music, the divine language of
harmony ,-the nobler expression of soul.
To our people It has won for them
a recognition from the world as be
ing the one race upon whom God has
poured his richest and purest bless
ings of music. Ethiopia has stretched
forth her hand In no more picturesque
manner than In disseminating her
tuneful melodies throughout the world.
We are brought to an Immediate con
sideration of some of these melodies
by tho presentation of Prof. Work's
chorus In "The Tale of Old Japan,"
by S. Coleridge Taylor. Taylor's mu
sic is sweet but difficult, still not dif
ficult In the usual way of music, not
calling so much for fancy vocalization
as It does for power, sweetness or a
dramatic sense of pathos. Taylor's
cadences are sure to have a weird
turn and finish peculiarly tuneful, hav
ing that distant offness so beautlfful
In compositions by colored composers.
Prof. Work was fortunate In secur
ing a chorus to enter at once Into
the splrltdom of this oriental tale.
Miss Cora Carr sounded the prelude
and the audlenco Is ushered into the
beginning of the s,tory. The Bweet,
exact notes ot tho piano strike the
ear as some clear, limpid dripping of
water upon water. The chorus takes
up the narrative in a lusty manner.
The auditors grasped the theme read
lly; the characters are clearly marked
both by chorus and soloist ;the plot
begins to unravel and right promise-
ful It Is In the beginning. "Klml" Is
a beautiful girl. Sawara is a young
painter full of genius and love, the
poetry of life. They meet, make their
betrothal and separate by clrcura
stance to meet again; but oh how un
like they had anticipated.
In narrating this, remember the
chorus and soloists are taking up the
song alternately and Jointly. Mr. Rus-
se), the baritone, first assumes a lead
ing part and Impresses tho audience
with his full rounded voice and bold
consummate style.
"Yoichl Tenko, the painter, dwelt by
the purple sea, painting tho peacock
islands under his willow tree." The so
pranos take up the story: "KImi was
loved of Tenko," then chorus burst
ing out with soprano section leading
"Peonies crowned the way" iri a hap
py effort "clad In blue and white ar
ray" "came Sawara to the school," all
told In a highly jubilant tone, the
whole chorus reaching a glorious out
burst of expression. Sopranos and al
tos alike vying with bass and tenor
while piano fairly rippled and talked.
Thus goes the development of this
highly wrought story under Asiatic
sky and poetic Influence. Perhaps
excepting the work of the generbus
chorus which did credit to Prof.
Work's training, Mrs. Emma Payne,
the contralto soloist, was easily the
star. This lady has some fine native
qualities as an interpreter of song, viz.,
passion, deep sympathy, pathos and
a rich mellow voice. When singing
the song thought seems to permeate
her whole being, radiating her coun
tenance to an ethereal light. This Is
especially discernible as she thus tells
of Sawara: "Far away his growing
fame, lit the clouds no message came.
from the sky whereon she gazed, un
der tho silvery willow tree, far away
from Tenko."
Singing these lines in a highly ac
celerated voice and dying with that
extended roundness and tranquility as
the spirit of the song requires. "Un
der the silvery willow tree, far away
from Tenko, small white hands In the
temple raised." Madam Corrlne Les
ter, the soprano soloist, takes up the
narration "Stick of Incense In the
flame, tho my love forget my name,
help him, bless him all the same and
bring him back to Tenko." Only in a
few Instances did the madam show
her former brilliancy In singing.
It is the writer's opinion that the par-1
tlcular song was unsuitable to show '
the singer to best advantage. The
madam will always do better In high
vocalization or operatic flourish rath
er than In turns where pure feeling
and sweet melody are required. Now
chorus, now basses and baritone take
the tale until a tenor solo Is reached.
This is 3ung by Capt. N. Clark Smith.
Sawara, remember, has returned for
his love. This girl Is named Klml. Sa
wara applies himself to Tenko, the
girl's uncle. Tenko for certain rea
sons cruelly tells Sawara that "Klml
left me all alone, under the silvery
willow tree, left me, whispered Tenko,
Klml had a heart of stone." This
statement bewilders and dazes Sawara
and he does not know how to take It.
Therefore, the tenor solo starts In the
manner Mr. Smith rendered it follow
ing both the sense and spirit of the
music. The tenor must express the be
wilderment of Sawara, must sing as if
one was thinking aloud or as trying to
collect some half-gone thoughts to
gether. "Ktmi, Klml, who is she?
Klml? Ah the child that played 'round
the willow' tree, she prayed often -and
what e'er I said she believed It Ten
ko." Understanding the sense of the
story in this simple way you can ac
count for the singer's apparent incon
gruity when he sang "Klml Kimi
Kimi" in his quiet way. Nevertheless
we do not believe the great bandmas
ter's forte is anywhere outside of the
circle of his band.
After all we must not assume any
severe or critical attitude toward local
efforts in music, yet we must have our
ideals in such if we are to lift the com
munity to a higher standard of musi
cal conception. We must insist on cer
tain standards and work faithfully and
with pleasure to attain them. Prof.
Work has started the ball "a rolling,"
other prominent musicians have co
operated. Watch Colored Kansas City
go up the ladder of progress In music!
Prof. Jackson with his chorus at W. U.
and Allen Chapel, Madame Bacote
with her splendid choir at the Second
Baptist church, Captain N. Clark
Smith's band and Prof. Work's "S. Col
eridge Taylor Union," all jointly, co
operatively and pleasantly working to
gether, are bound to bring great re
sults. Prof. Work must be accorded
much credit for the initial effort of a
broader work in musical uplift. These
different recitals are to be given
monthly. People interested in these
affairs from a musical standpoint will
be added and sought and developed.
There will be no favoritism on social
prestige. The chief motive will be to
elevate the taste for better music, bet
ter sung and better played. It is be
lieved that near 40,000 Colored people
will approve of this by their patron
age and co-operation In great Kansas
Pity.

NEGROES AT THE THEATERS.
. Mr. Editor: Thanking you for your
Indulgence, I beg to say that I regret
not having a personal acquaintance
with Mrs. Mary Brown, but I am
pleased to see that my article under
above caption was of sufficient inter
est to attract the lady's attention and
to draw forth from her a criticism.
From reading the lady's reply I be
lieve that she has correct Ideas about
position and character, and .1 am sure
that her unjust accusation of me was
owing "to her misunderstanding my
article. It is possible that she and
I have a different definition of "a rep
resentative audience." Although I
have seen the term often, I have never
read its defintton, and I take it for
granted that a representative audience
may have one or more classes repre
sented, and usually whenever there
Is a large gathering of Negroes which
has for Its mqtive something of popu
lar interest, several classes are rep
resented, such as the professional, so
ciety, laboring, domestic and sporting,
and I have sufficient knowledge of the
world and of human nature to know
that not all the members of any class
possess the same degree of character.
No where in my article did I men
tion "first class" or "second class"
Negroes, but on one thing we both
agree that Is, there was some very
bad behavior shown in the audience
and I naturally surmised It came from
the members of that class or type
whose environment was such as not
to Inspire In or obtain for them a
knowledge of good manners.
Pursuing the theme of Negroes at
the theater further, I have seen wom
en of our society class, I presume, at
tend In most elaborate costumes and
have seen many Negroes unduly de
monstrative in approval or disapprov
al of the acts, forgetting that fine cos
tumes are out of place in the least
conspicuous places and that the actors
are nof offering their talent for the
entertainment of Negroes, and prob
ably would not appear on the stage
for, the benefit of nn entire Negro au
dience. The editor of this paper ought to
be commended for his manly stand
and should be supported In his effort
to appeal to the race pride of Negroes
to stop assisting in their own humilia
tion at the Orpheum theater. When
that theater was at its old stand on
Ninth street thousands of Negroes con
tributed to Its support, and actors of
our race among the best of their class
on its stage entertained with credit
.and satisfaction its audiences. Dur
ing that time to my knowledge there
was no outbreak of race friction and
there was no action on the part of
Negroes that interfered with the gen
eral attendance. Yet when the new
Orpheum opened Its doors, It was
found that the seats provided for Ne
groes only were so high above the
stage that It was actually uncomfort
able to try to see and hear, and tlv
entrance to these seats was from a
side door In the alley. Yet Negroes
are attending this theater Instead of
boycotting It, which the race to a man,
woman and child should do. This ac
tion would be a practical expression of
race pride and would command the
respect of other races.
Concluding, if Mrs. Mary Brown will
admit to herself that she accused me
wrongfully through mistake, I will be
pleased, and I would like to meet her
with others of her class to endeavor
to effect some measure to Improve the
manners of that type of the race un
der discussion. J. A. WILSON.
COLORED MAN KIDNAPPED RICH
HOTEL MAN'S WIFE OF SAN
DIEGO, CAL., CAPTURED AT
SALT LAKE CONFESSED THAT
IT WAS MUTUAL.
The. Associated. Press. Tuesday
morning carried a report of a sup
posed sensational kidnapping of a
white woman by a colored man, but
tho truth of the would be sensation
Is best told in the words of the man
tand woman after their capture at
Salt Lake City. Said Mrs. Vola Hood
the woman in, the case:
"The elopement was mutual. He
did not threaten to kill or harm me.
I wanted to go with him. If they
let htm go to Chicago, 1 will go
back to San Diego willingly and face
the music. There is no truth In the
statement that he forced me to leave.
I planned It all and handled the
money."
She declared, according to the po
lice, that she left her husband be
cause she was In love with Dodds,
the colored man.
Dodds claimed he and Mrs. Hood
had been close friends a little oyer
nine months. He declared he was
strongly attracted to her and that
the attraction seemed to be mutual.
Their relations, he added, were not
suspected by Hood, and Dodds' pres
ence near Mrs. Hood could be always
explained by his employemnt as por
ter, houseman and chauffeur.
Doods declared they had discussed
their future many times, and he had
declared to make her his wife, if
Mrs. Hood would leave her husband.
Several times, he said, he had tried to
leave Mrs. Hood, but Bho had threat-

Father, I feel myself Inclined
To wander from thee Into sin.
I have not yet a perfect mind,

WHITE ELOPER DEFENDS LOVE
FOR, NEGRO.
Salt Lake, Jan. 23. Van Lee Hood,
prominent hotel owner of San Diego,
Cal., will arrive here at 2:15 this after
noon to defend the honor ot his wife,
Mrs. Viold Hood, who is being held In
the city jail with Raymond M. Dodds.
a Negro with whom she eloped Friday
from her home In San Diego.
Gripping the bars of her cell in the
woman's ward with White hands, Mrs,
Hood said:
"Raymond and I are wrong only In
the eyes ot society. I love him and he
loves me. The fact that we are of a
different race should make no differ
ence. I am happier when I am with
him than with any one else in the
world oh, why wan't they let us be
happy together."
Fearing that he would be arrested
on sight and hounded almost to dis
traction Dodds entered the police sta
tion here early yesterday morning
find gave himself up to Captain J. J
Roberts.
Mrs. Hood was picked, up a short
time laterd by a Negro Informant of
the police department and placed in
custody.
"Oh, these laws of society, these un
natural, so-called laws of .nature! Why
am I, a froo woman, not free to seek
out my mate, be he white or black ?
Why do they seek to persecute because
I love Raymond Dodds and proudly as
sert It ?" continued Mrs. Dodds.
"For a year and a halw I fought this
love, fought with all my might, but to
no avail. Many times Raymond said
to me.- 'It Is wrong for us to hope, we
should part,' but always there was that
calling In my heart, the desire to be
with him. Many times we parted but
always to meet again. Either I would
seek him out or ho would 'find me.
Willingly have I abandoned husband,
home, family and friends for Raymand,
and I would do it again to be with
for just a day.
"Explain my attachment for Ray
mond. Many times have I tried to ex
plain to myself. Can, any woman ex
plain her love for a roan.? Can a man
explain his lovo for a woman ? No, love
Is a puzzle, and my love for Raymond
is no more a puzzle than what society
would term natural love,
"All that I know of this love of mine
is that It is simply hidden in my heart,
never to bo disturbed. No longer will
I fight against it, for In it is my ihappl-
ness. Why should X foar the ridicule of,
A film entitled "The Bat
tle Cry of Peace" is being
shown at the Willis Wood
which theatre Colored people
are not allowed to attend.
Recently some one with bet
ter intentions than judgment
arranged so that Negroes
might be allowed a Jim-crow
hour for each of two days in
which to see some of these
peace portrayals. A few Ne
groes who do not mind being
humiliated, undertook to
work up attendance for these
special concessions but did
not meet with any great suc
cess. If the moral support
of Negroes is necessary to the
peace propagandists their
abstraction should not be
colored with any form of
race distinction or Jim-crow-ism.
If Negroes cannot at
tend the Willis Wood theatre
whenever they desire, then to
be self-respecting they should
not go at all.
Naturally we who are upon
every hand buffeted, assault
ed, maimed and tortured by
these peace-loving exponents
should make the very best
advocates of their cause. Or
perhaps it were better that
we first have an example of
peace at home ere we dictate
to belligerent nations who
simply on account of a differ
ence in color regard us as the
dregs of the earth.

We arrived in Spokano on Saturday
morning at 7 o'clock and found it one
of the prettiest, best laid out and most
progressive cities we had visited. We
were surprised by the elegance and
magnitude of the buildings on its
principal thoroughfares, several being
ten, twelve and even fourteen stories
high. This city Is not yet forty years
old and In 1885 had a population of
less than 3,000, while today it boasts
of a population of 100,000 with all the
varied Industries It takes to make a
city of this size. Here Is located the
greatest water power plant In Amer
ica, which controls the bulk of the
water power in the state and owns
twenty acres of valuable land in the
heart of the city. Electric power is
possibly cheaper here than any other
place in the country, and it has been
the cause of many manufacturing
plants locating here. Spokane is also
the center of a great mining district,
in fact the city is built upon the for
tunes accrued from mining. Many
buildings were pointed out to us own
ed by men who twenty-five years ago
came Into the district without a dol
lar comparatively, and by a lucky
stroke have made millions in the
mines. Several Colored men have
been fortunate in mining and at the
present time a company of Colored
men are exploiting what is known as
the Clarence Ray Buffalo Hump Gold
Mining Co. There is also a very sub
stantial Negro corporation engaged in
the fruit development under the head
ing of the Deer Lake Irrigated Or
chards Co., of which Mr. P. B. Barrow,
Jr., is president, and which has a cap
ital stock of $150,000. They own 140
acres of land in the beautiful Deer
Lake Valley, which has a soil of fine
volcanic ash, the best in the world
for'frufts, wh'leh'is 44 miles north of
Spokane and produces a wonderful
crop of apples and fruits each year.
While here we were entertained at
the home of Mrs. Wagner, 108 E. Pa
cific street, and after removing the
stains of travel and having a substan
tial breakfast, we called a taxi and
drove over the city, viewing various
points of interest. We had the pleas
ure of meeting Mr. F. A. Stokes, the
real estate and mining king of the
race in that section of the country, and
whose sister is the wife of the Rev.
J. B. Beckham of Independence, and
whose mother also lives there, and we
were royally entertained at his beau
tiful and palatial home during the
evening. We also met Mr. W. R. Mo
tin, secretary of the Negro Business
League In that city, who Is a brother
of Ruben Motln of our city. We also
had the please of meeting Mr. and
Mrs. Crutchfield, who are very active
In the life of our people in that city.
Mrs. Crutchfield was formerly Mrs.
Hasbrooks of this city, and with her
is her son Fred, who is an agent for
the Clarence Ray Mining Co., and who
has a beautiful wife and a happy
home, and her daughter, the charming
and brilliant Ella Hasbrooks, who Is
now Mrs. Ella Holloway and who was
one of the most popular girls who ever
lived in Kansas City.
We also met our old friend, II. D.
Washington and wife, formerly of Car-
rolton, Mo., who has a hundred and
sixty acres sixty miles north of Re
gina, Canada, and who says ,he is as
good a blacksmith as he was back
home. Possibly there was no one we
met with more real pleasure on our
trip than Mr. and Mrs. Clarence
Grubbs of 4023 Crestline avenue, with
whom we had a most delightful 10
o'clock Sunday morning breakfast.
They have a beautiful home nicely lo
cated and decorated and beautified
with all that quiet but Impressive ele
gance for which Mrs. Grubbs, who
was formerly Miss Jessie Pierce of
this city, is renowned. After break
fast we accompanied them to the
Bethel A, M. E. Church, of which the
brilliant and eloquent Rev. D. A. Gra
ham, D. D., is pastor, but we were dis
appointed In hearing him as It was
Quarterly meeting and the Presiding
Elder, our old friend and battle scar
red , warrior of more than thirty-five
years' service in the Master's cause,
Rev. C. N. Douglass, delivered the
message, which was very appropriate
to the occasion. Here we met Mrs.
Hagan, formerly Mrs. Houston of Kan
sas City, and also had the pleasure of
meeting the family of Rev. Graham,
whose wife Is a sister to the wife cf
Rev. Sampson Brooks, pastor of St.
Paul In St. Louis. Their daughter,
Lola B., won third prize in the Orator
ical contest in the High School of the
city of Spokane and a gold medal In
tho Typewriter Contest offered by the
Remington people, the fourth prize
ever won by that company In the city
of Spokane. We also met Fred Mur
phy, a member ot Lodge No. 53 of Ma
sons in this city, and also Miss Esther
Carter, a young black girl who won
the scholarship ot the High Schools of
the city and was given a three-year
scholarship in any college she chose
to select, and selected Wllberforco
University, where she ,is now in at
tendance. Her mother is a splendid
woman, a widow with four children,
but that did not hinder her from giv
ing her children every advantage pos
sible and they cut and h
from a little piece of ground they
owneu mat they might earn a living
and educate the children and every
one of them is a credit to the .race,
Esther being declared the mo3t expert
stenographer and typist in the schools
at Spokane.
At night we had the pleasure ,of vis
iting the Baptist church of the city,
Rev. Smith, pastor, and heard a splen
did choir, cood nractical sermon, nffpi-
which both the Grand Secretary and
mysea were called on for a short ad
dress, whech were given. We also de
livered an address at 3 o'clock in thn
afternoon at the A. M. E. church,
which although having only been an

FORTUNES FROM REAL ESTATE.
Most Kansas City fortunes large or
small have sprung from real estate.
Ask any of the old timers who have
watched Kansas City grow from a
small boat landing at Second and Main
streets to one of the most properous
cities in these United States.
There are only a very few of us who
have the brains and energy and op
portunity to become big merchants, big
business men, big railroad men or
big financiers, and to earn a fortune
In business fields; but any thrifty man
or woman with any ordinary good luck
can accumulate at least a modest for
tune in real estate. The first purchase
Is the hard one to pay for; the second
much easier; the third buys itself, and
after that your fortune grows like,a
snowoau roiling downnui.
The Unearned Increment.
The inevitable growth of value in
real estate Is now recognized by some
foreign governments (Germany among
them) by the imposition of a tax upon
the "unearned increment." In Ger
many if you pay $100 for a tract of
land and It Increases In value to $1,000,
you have to give the government a part
of this increase in value. In time
this will undoubtedly be the law In
all countries and the people of the
next generation will regret that they
did not live in "those good old times"
when the owner of real estate received
all of its increase in value.
John Jacob Astor, the founder of
the Astor fortune In New York City,
which now includes probably over
$100,000,000 In New York real estate.
said:
"I have made it my rule to buy real
estate during periods of business de
pression. Short sighted people at such
times hold on to their money; a sense
less fear gives them a kind of heart
failure, and the consequence Is that
a comparatively few shrewd buyers,
with sand in their craw and common
sense in their heads, pick up the good
things that are forced upon the mar
ket." All financiers agree that money is
as cowardly as a coyote, runs and
hides upon the slightest hint of dan
ger. Much Wealth Here.
The present business depression as
far as' Kansas City is concerned is
about 95 per cent mental and 'E per
cent real, the real part of it being-,
duo principally to the war, Kansas:
City and Its territory Is richer now
than ever before. The wealth is real
and tangible ;you can see it with your
eyes, handle it with your hands, sense
it with every one of your Benses. The
people have more money per capita;
the farms have less incumbrance per
acre; and the territory has more corn,
more wheat, more forage, worth more
money per bushels and per ton than
ever before.
The Negroes of Kansas City should
get busy, buy real estate and watch
your money grow,
