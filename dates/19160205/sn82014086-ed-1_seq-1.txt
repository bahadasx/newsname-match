nothing new has come through con

duels still predominate along the Aus-tro-Itallan
line.
The Austrians are continuing their
advance into Albania with Durazzo,
their immediate objective and have
captured the town of Kurya, according
to the Austrian official communication.
It is probable that the town of Kroia,
some twenty miles northeast of Dur
azzo, is the ,place taken as available
maps show no such town as Kurya.

With State Department.
Washington, Feb. 4. In the name of
the British owners of the steamer Ap
pam, Cecil Spring-Rice, the British
ambassador, today lodged : with the
state department a formal request that
the. ship be turned -over to' the Brit
ish ' consul- under the terms of ; The
Hague convention. "
Notice . also, was served tiiat 1U would
be m -violation of international law if
the United' States permitted the Ger
man prize commander- of the Appa
either to increase the efficiency of the
ship; add to her offensive power or
recruit her crew. ' Lieutenant - Berg
has only 22 men In his prize crew at
present, a number insufficient to nav
igate a ship as large as the Appam
A compliance with the British sug
gestion only on the latter point would
effectually prevent the departure of
the Appam from Newport News.
On the Alabama case as a precedent
the British contention is that any
changes either in eqcipment or per
sonnel of the Appam which would even
in a limited degree give her offensive
power and enable her to prey on
British commerce would be a violation
of law for which the United States
could be held responsible.

Cannot Afford to
The time has passed for giving serious consideration to the man
who does not believe in advertising. Advertising is as much a part
of today's life as the telephone, the trolley car or the automobile.
There Is nothing magical or mysterious about it, and the greatest ad
vertising successes have been due to the plain use of common sense
applied with a knowledge of human nature, with the resulting crea
tion of desire the art of touching the imagination of large numbers.
Advertising has become a power which cannot be sidetracked or
disregarded. It is positive and It la permanent. It brings results
else the evidence would have been to the contrary long ago, and it Is
that portion of it which reaches the largest number of people that
shows the greatest results.
Such means that the advertising medium which goes to the
homes and has the largest circulation Is the best and cheapest prop
osition. In this part of Connecticut that place is filled by The Bulle
tin. It Is a business accelerator which no merchant can afford to be
without. . .

VISCOUNT BRYCE CONDEMNS
POLICY OF REPRISALS.
Says Great Britain Should Stand for
Justice and Right.
London, Feb. 4, 10.45 p. m. Viecount
Bryce, former ambassador to the
United States, speaking at Bedford
college, London, tonight, condemned
the policy of reprisals against Ger
many, which since the last Zeppelin
raid has gained many advocates.
"We stand in this war for Justice
and right," Viscount Bryce said. "We
stand for humanity, and from that po
sition we must not depart. I don't
myself believe for a moment that we
shall gain anything by departing from
it.
"If it came to cruelty against cruel
ty, the enemy would always win. I see
no reason to think that any recourse to
inhuman practices that are shocking
to philosophy and morals, which the
enemy has adopted, would have the
slightest effect on him or promote in
any way our military success. We
would not gain, and we should cer
tainly lose, because there is nothing
that has won us more approval and
sympathy of all that is best In the neu
tral nations than that we have cham
pioned the cause of justice and human
ity. That Is what has nerved our arm
and has created a unity never paral
leled In any previous crisis In our his
tory." i

the United States and Germany pro
trudes from the tentative draft of the
Lusitanla agreement, perfected by Am
bassador Von Bernstorft and Secre
tary Lansing, as the stumbling block
which has caused Berlin to refer to
the negotiations, as having reached a
crisis and Washington to characterize
the situation as grave.

retary Lansing today by Count Von

Method of submarine warfare used by
the German naval authorities in sink
ing the liner, an acceptance of liabil
ity for the loss of neutral lives, which
Berlin hopes will satisfy the United
States and still not bind Germany from
continuing the submarine campaign.
Within Pale of International Law.
German officials believe that their
previous promise to discontinue sink
ing unresisting merchantmen without
warning brings the submarine ques
tion within the pale of International
law and that any inclusion of that
phase in the Lusitanla agreement is
unnecessary and humiliating to the
imperial government.
Word "Illegal" Stumbling Block.
The word "illegal" in the draft the
German ambassador transmitted to his
government as meeting all the conten
tions of the United States, is taken to
have been regarded in Berlin as sus
ceptible of application not to the Lusi
tanla case alone, but to the entire sub
marine campaign.
"That is the only explanation which
officials here can find for the state
ment of Dr. Zimmerman, under-sec-retary
of foreign affairs, . that "the
United States suddenly made new de
mands which it is impossible for us
to accept."
Position of U. S. Unchanged.
Secretary X.nsing declared today
that the position of the United States
was unchanged and the German am
bassador knew of no demands which
were not embodied in the proposal he
sent to Berlin.
It is known that the only change the
Berlin foreign office has made In the
agreement drawn by the secretary and
the ambassador is to substitute for
the word "illegal" a phrase, which,
while assuming liability for the lives
of neutrals lost on the Lusitanla, does
not admit of construction into prohi
bition of submarine warfare.
The despatch the ambassador re
ceived today and presented to the sec
retary was very brief and covered only
that one point. Otherwise the docu
ment is unchanged as it was drawn to
meet all the contentions of the United
State's.
After the ambassador's visit to the
state department today Secretary
Lansing declared "the situation Is un
changed." No More Nor No Less Grave.
That is authoritatively stated to rep
resent the situation accurately. It has
become no more grave and by that
fact it has become no less grave. Its
status has not materially changed and
It may remain so for four or five days
at least while President Wilson and
Secretary Lansing consider Germany's
answer fully.
In a like manner It may be stated
authoritatively that it does not fol
low that either a completely satisfac
tory settlement or an open break must
follow at the end of that time. The
negotiations may continue. -

Washington. Feb. 4. The Phllinnine
bill, which would extend to the Philip
pines a greater degree of self-government
and would authorize the presi
dent to grant them absolute inde
pendence within four years, passed the
senate tonight, 52 to 24. Various dem

solidly for the measure.
Backed by President Wilson.
It is understood the bill will go to
the house with the backing of Presi
dent Wilson and will be pressed for

Indication of what action the house
will take, but administration leaders

Follette, Norris and Works.
Refused, to Modify Clarke Amendment
Bybverwhelming majorities the sen
ate had refused to modify the Clarke
amendment, adopted several days ago,
which contains the independence pro
vision, and also gives the president
authority to extend or withhold inde
pendence at the end of four years if
he should find conditions in the islands
unfavorable. The time would be ex
tended, however, only until an Incom
ing congress could consider the sub
ject. .
Senator Stone declared the bill was
In reality not an independence measure
at ail because, of the extension provision.-
and offered an amendment to

dow,-,.60 to 17. Senator Hitchcock,
chairman of the Philippine committee,
sought to amend the bill by extending
Independence within four years on con
dition that the people and legislature
of the Philippines should ratify a con
stitution. This was rejected, 62 to 25.
Senator Stone Urged Hie Amendment
I am making a last appeal for what
I think Is good faith and just treat
ment of the Philippines," said Senator
Stone in urging his amendment. "I am
unquestionably and unconditionally in
favor of carrying out the pledge of the
democratic party by relinquishing con
trol over the Philippine Islands com
pletely. I am not in favor of confer
ring independence. with a string to It.
I oppose any provision which will
make It possible for a future presi
dent of the United States to send this
issue back to congress. We are, in
thus bill, not offering independence in
fact, but merely , a suggestion of it to
some future president."
Senator Norris in Opposition.
. Senator Norris in opposing a pro
vision in the bill empowering the pres.
Ident to retain naval bases in the
Philippines, declared President Wilson
had been converted from, a man of
peace to a militarist.

has changed his mind on that. Now
he says he is in favor of the United
States having the largest navy in the

Democrats Scored by Senator Smith.
Senator William Alden Smith scored
the democrats for their determination
to give up the Philippines and de
clared the American people did not
dish to see the American flag over the
Islands hauled down.
"This action is an unjustifiable and
uncalled for surrender of American
rights,- he said. "If these islands be

warring among themselves, you will be
blamed for it, as you ought to be. If

cowards abandoned a task which Prov
idence placed in your hands and which
by this act you are acknowledging you,
Senator Stone, replying, character
ized Senator Smith's remarks as "a
vociferous, scattering, dreary. Inane,
partisan harangue."
Provisions of the Bill.
The bill carries a provision author
izing the president, when independence
is granted, to negotiate treaties needed
to protect all property rights of ail
citizens of the United States and other
countries in the islands and to acquire
such naval bases and coaling stations
within that territory as she deems
necessary. The upper house of the
Philippine legislature would be en-
j ineeu io memoers, zz cnosen by
wv lw b uu lwo appointed oy we
governor general to represent the non
Chrtetiajy .tribes. The- lower house
would -be increased from 81 to 90, the.
people choosing 81 and the governor
naming 9.
Governor General Would Have Veto
Power.
The governor genera -would have a
veto power, such as rests now with
the secretary of war. A two-thirds
vote of the legislature would be needed
to overrule it. The president would
have the right to interpose an abso- !
lute veto within six months.
N6 restrictions are imposed on the ,
legislature's power to levy export du- 1
ties except that they cannot be levied .
on exports to the United States. A I
limit of $17,000,000 is placed on the
public indebtedness, which permits the
issuance of new bonds to replace the
$7,000,000 friar land bonds now being
retired.
Increase Right of Suffrage.
The bill would increase the right of
suffrage from the present 250,000 to
approximately 700,000 by extending It
to any citizen able to read and write
a native language. Polygamous mar
riages and the import, sale or manu
facture of intoxicating drinks or drugs,
except the native beverages, would be
forever prohibited, and no laws could
be passed that would permit religious
discrimination, slavery or the creation
of a nobility.
