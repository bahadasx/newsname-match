It AKTLKSV I1.LK. Okla., Feb, 4.
if signs do nol fall, this section of
Oklahoma ought 1 1 produce as great
a crop of wheat tin year us any of
the banner counties oi Kansas. Right
now conditions for winter wheat are
the best they haVO been in years and
there is no section , I Mo' state where
conditions are more favorable.
1 To begin with, ihe ground has been
' covered with a four-Inch snow almost
continuously since early In January,
On top of this ll.e'V have been u
number of severe days with plenty of
frost, which makes certain the green
iitiK, the greatest enemy of the wheal
crop, has been exterminated, The
ground was never in latter condition,
and when the spring days arrive, there
will be plenty of moisture In the
ground to send the wheat crop away
under almost perfect conditions,
This past year there was promise of
a record yield of wheat In this section,
1 at the floods practically ruined the
crop in the bottom lands, lit this
county alone thousands of acres of
wheat were destroyed, if this county
COUld prevent bverfloWS, it would add
a million dollars in wealth annually
to the county. But even though over
flows annually cause meat damage to
I !k crops in this county and section, each
year sees a I1k increase in the acre
age and yield of all crops.
