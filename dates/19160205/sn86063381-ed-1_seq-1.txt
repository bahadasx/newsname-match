The odds tavor the Bemidji quint
as it lias not been defeated this sea
son while the Little Falls team has
been detected by Aitkin Another
leason tor odds on Bemidji, say local
lans, is that the Bemidji team last

Little Falls team, however, has de
feated Aitkin and Sauk Center, both

BRITISH CLAIM
STEAMSHIP APPAM
Sir Cecil Spring Rice, Ambassador,
Lodges Request Under Terms of
The Hague Convention.
Washington, Feb. 5 In the name
of the British owners of the steam
ship Appam, Sir Cecil Spring Rice,
the British ambassador, late yester
day lodged with the state department
a formal request that the ship be
turned over to the British consul un
der the terms of The Hague conven
tion
Notice also was served that it
would be in violation of international
law if the United States permitted
the German prize commander of the
Appam either to increase the ef
ficiency of that ship, add to her of
fensive power or recruit his crew.
Lieutenant Berg has only 22 men in
his prize crew at present, a number
insufficient to navigate a ship as
large as the Appam.
A compliance with the British sug
gestions only on the latter point
would eventually prevent the depart
ure of the Appam from Newport
News.

GERMANS WANT
ANOTHER NOTE
ON LUSITANIA
Instructions to Bernstorff to Seek
Further Negotiations With
United States.
TEUTONS SAY DEMANDS
ARE HUMILIATING
Berlin, Feb, 5.Despite the pessi
mistic reports in regard to the Ger
man-American relations, officials here
scoff at the possibilities of Germany's
refusal to disavow the Lusitania sink
ing will bring on an immediate break
with America. Germany's instruc
tions to Bernstorff call for another
American answer. It is realized that
the situation is serious but it is be
lieved that there will be found a solu
tion.
"Illegal" Causes Trouble.
Washington, Feb. 5.The one word
"illegal" as differently interpreted in
the United States and Germany pro
trudes from the tentative draft of
the Lusitania agreement perfected by
Ambassador Bernstorff and Secretary
Lansing is the stumbling block which
has caused Berlin to refer to the ne
gotiations as having reached a crisis
and Washington to characterize the
situation as grave.
Germany's answer, presented to
Secretary Lansing yesterday by Count
von Bernstorff, proposes that instead
of an out-and-out admission of ille
gality of the method of submarine
warfare used by the German naval
authorities in sinking the liner, an
acceptance of liability for the loss of
neutral lives, which Berlin hopes will
satisfy the United States and still not
bind Germany from continuing the
submarine campaign.
Declare Humiliating.
German officials believe that their
previous promise to discontinue sink
ing unresisting merchantmen without
warning brings the submarine cam
paign within the pale of interna
tional law and that any inclusion of
that phase in the Lusitania agreement
is unnecessary and humiliating to the
imperial government.
