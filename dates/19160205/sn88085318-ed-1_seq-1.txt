Colville, Stevens County, Washington, Saturday, February 5, 1916
Cleaning and Repairing

The baseball season is ushered
in with the statement that the
armies in the Balkans are making
strenuous efforts to protect their
bases.
This state has entered the pre
paredness game by establishing
dry docks and relegating schoon
ers.
Roosevelt's maledictions on hy
phenated Americans may be best
expressed in the terms of his own
title as ex-president. That hy
phen never suited him.
Representative E. A. Sims, one
of the most prominent republi
cans of the state, who has been
at the national capital for some
weeks, has come out solidly for
Senator Weeks for the republican
nomination for president. With
Sims and other republican leaders
of his state in favor of a rank
stand-patter for president, we fail
to see where the progressives will
get off, even if some of them give
support to the old machine.
If Teddy consents to become the
republican standard bearer this
year he will at least be able to
know all about the men and the
machine he is leading. He can
turn to his old speeches and find
out ail about them.
Compulsory military drill for
all male students during their
first two years of residence at the
University of Washington will
continue indefinitely as a part of
the curriculum. The faculty,
acting for the first time on the
matter after a deliberation of
several weeks, voted 68 to 27 in
favor of the report of the commit
tee which recommended continu
ing the work of the cadet corps
as at present organized. Many of
those voting against the report
were not opposed to drill, in it
self, but disliked compulsion.
Twice the state legislature im
posed compulsory military train
ing upon the university by at
taching a rider to the appropria
tion bill. At the last session no
mention was made of drill, and
the authorities at the university
deemed themselves free to con
sider and decide the question.
A committee of seven members
of the faculty held sessions ex
tending over a period of eight
weeks, and received the represen
tations of various societies, indi
viduals and political parties who
ranged themselves for and against
compulsory drill. In the end the
members of the committee issued
their report, five favoring reten
tion of drill, one urging abolition
and one believing the student
should decide whether he would
take the course.
The North Yakima Republic
says: "The Colville Examiner
professes to think that if the re
publican party is sincere in its
protestations that it has become
progressive it will nominate Roos
evelt. That might have been all
right a while back, but Roosevelt
is like the flea. It is impossible
to put one's hand on him. Just
when the republican party had re
formed and was getting ready to
take up the great reformer again,
he went off and tied up with the
reactionaries. The party is not
now in a mood to nominate a man
who dines with the GuggenheiniH
and counsels with the Steel Trust
on how to run the country. It is
too progressive."
Control of this country's water
power used in public service op
erations is in the hands of a ver.v
few men. Six companies own
one-fourth of it, eighteen corpor
ations own more than one-half.
These excellent result*, gained
during the many years of "repub
lican prosperity," are ample reas
ons for the return of a republican
rule. They should convince
every Wall «treet connection that
the republican party is best for
their interests.
The argument that "big busi
ness" is best for the mass of the
people is a pleasing argument
among frenzied financiers. But
we wonder why it is that the
working man, the farmers, and
the Grangers of the country, are
not taking so much stock in it
as of yore.
Those republicans who demand
intervention in Mexico, and those
republicans who declare that this
country is not even prepared to
defend itself, ough to get together.
Their theories disagree as badly
an do the present facts with their
tariff predictions.
Editors are in the habit of writ
ing things about people. But
seldom does the editor see him
self described in print. The fol
lowing is a description of the edi
tor of the Examiner as written
by one of the young women in the
journalistic course at the Univer
sity of Washington as part of the
assignment given to the freshman
students:
"There was an Irishman at the
newspaper Institute held at the
University of Washington. He
might have been a fire eater. His
eyes were auburn-colored with
large, black, flashing pupils. They
glinted and gleamed through his
gold-stemmed spectacles. Enough
hair for three men covered his
head. It, too, was auburn, and
stood out like a brush above his
shaved neck. Also, it was parted
almost in the middle, which, com
bined with his eyes, gave him a
look of fanatical intensity His
nose was thin and long, with a
bend in it that probably has a
history. Full lips, with a fem
inine appearance, and a strong, de
cided chin contradicted them
selves in the lower part of his
face. He was tall and sparely
formed, wearing a black suit of
gabardine, and a black necktie.
Finally, his name is J. C. Harri
gan, and he's the editor of the
Colville Examiner. Whoa. Dyna
mite!"
Instead of putting a quietus on
the liquor subject, the new liquor
law of this state seems to open a
vast field of speculation as to
what the law means, and the at
torney general has been swamped
with questions, and the various
prosecuting attorneys have vied
with themselves in disagreeing on
the various statements of the law.
It is discovered that a quart of
beer is not a quart, but only
about 24 ounces, therefore an in
dividual can have 16 supposedly
quart bottles of beer shipped
every 20 days in addition to 2
quarts of liquors.
It is discovered that search of
residence is a most dangerous
thing, regardless of the state
ments of the law, and prosecuting
attorneys are advising against any
such search unless the evidence is
overwhelming that there is an il
legal sale or distribution of
liquors. Other states have had
experience in searching private
residences, with disastrous finan
cial results to the searchers, as
suits are generally brought
against the searchers and the
sanctity of the home has been ful
ly established. If prosecuting
attorneys are wise, they will de
mand a good financial responsi
bility of those who desire to
search homes, and all searching
officials will make good investiga
tion before attempting to invade
the ganctity of the American
home, under fear of suit being
brought against their bondsmen.
Another point of interest is
being brought out relative to
publicity of those who secure
liquor permits from county au
ditors. Inasmuch as tampftTMM
workers, prohibition advocates,
church organizations and anti
saloon societies have all agreed
that the permit system is the
proper- and right method of se
curing liquor, and the law hat
been thoroughly Christianized and
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
sanctified by the prayers and
praises of the various clergy
throughout the state, the man
who boldly steps to the courthouse
and obeys the mandate of the law
in buying a permit should have
the approbation of the churches
and temperance workers who have
thanked their respective views of
deity that the law was passed as
it is. Some few views have been
expressed that permit buyers
should be upheld to public dis
approval, but inasmuch as the re
ligious element of the state, par
ticularly the protestant branch,
has set its seal of approval on the
law, it is hard to see how a com
pliance with the law can in such
a short time be obnoxious to the
element which so strongly favored
it.
The rights of individuals to car
ry liquor on the person, use it in
dividually with meals at public
places, etc., have not been fully
determined in a legal way, but
common sense has not yet been
repealed, and if men and women
will remember that it does not
cost anything to act like ladies
and gentlemen in public, there
should be little trouble from these
technical questions.
"Faith and begorry," said Pat,
"this broken window is more ser
ious than oi thot 'twas. It's
broken on both sides.
The Washington correspondent
to tln> Spokesman-Review said in
Tuesday's paper: "When the In
dian appropriation bill was under
debate in the house today Repre
sentative C. C. Dill made his
maiden speech, occupying 25 min
utes in an attack on the adminis
tration of the Colville and Spo
kane agencies. Mr. Dill has in the
bill language preventing the In
dian service spending tribal money
without appropriation by con
gress. To illustrate the need of
this language he asserted thai in
the last three years the officials
at Hie agencies named, though
knowing the reservation is soon to
he opened, have expended large
sinus of tribal money in building
fine houses and creating elaborate
gardens for service officials, in
stead of spending the money for
the Indians themselves. Mr. Dill
held the attention of the members
throughout, not one leaving for
the cloakroom, the usual practice,
when a new member speaks."
A meeting of the democratic
state, central committee is called
for Everett at 2 p. m. Feb. 5, to
make arrangements for selection
of delegates to the national con
vention at St. Louis, June 14, and
to arrange for the selection of a
national eomrnitteeman, and for
the transaction of any other busi
ness. Atty. F. Y. Wilson left
Thursday for Everett to attend
the meeting, representing this
county as democratic county
chairman.
During January the residents
of Stevens county contented them
selves with 12 liquor permits from
the county auditor's office, all of
the orders being sent to Frisco.
Eight orders were for whiskey of
various kinds and hoped-for qual
ities, 2 for alcohol, 1 for alcohol
and brandy, and 1 for wine. The
auditor received a total of $:< for
his services la seeing that the per
mits were properly marie out, the
express companies received for
each shipment a nice sum from
the FriMO dealer, and the Frisco
dealer Ims the rest.
