small things, let alone houses, lands, etc., because you
not have the money. A savings fund regularly cared

It is the best kind of help, as it puts you in a position to

Chapter 21. Two reel Special comedy.
"Mother died this morning." That
was the message I received from my
brother, J. E. Peacock, Lake Odessa,
Michigan, last Monday. . It was not
unexpected, and yet expectant con
templation of the inevitable cannot;
completely buffer the shock of un
welcome news. ...... ;
Mother is dead! The years of bar
days were four score and one, and
from the first snows of December be
yond. She was privileged to live a
long useful life, full of good deeds
and many kindnesses. . Death has
dealt leniently with her family only
five times in the almost sixty years of
her married life has she been called
to mourn the loss of a member. She
is survived by seven of her nine
children, twenty of her twentv-two
grandchildren, and twelve is the un
broken number of her great-grandchildren.
Considering her long life
and the number of her descendants,
few women are so fortunate as she
has been. Although her descendants
are scattered throughout six states,
most or them remained near the
home nest, and both of her daughters
were at hand to help care for her in
the hour of tier extremity.
How iittle we know about the fut
ure or what the years shall bring to
us. JNine years ago 1 was invited to
help my parents celebrate their gold
en wedding anniversary. Instead,
I went to the hospital. Since that time
we have hopped that they might be
permitted to complete their sixtieth
year of wedded life together. It was
a dream then, and now it is an
impossibility. More than fifty-nine
years is a long time for two people
to live together, either married or
unmarried, and few there are jwho
accomplish it. Fifteen years ago my
parents visited Kansas. They were
feeble, even then, but they under
took the long and tiresome journey
of more than twelve hundred miles
because it was then thought that my
signed to lay away in His last resting
n-n-c "ui uciuicu uroiner; realizing
that our loss is his gain.
Resolved, That in his death our
union has lost a true, loyal, devoted
member, who was ever ready to ex
tend a helping hand in time of need
and who always had a voice of sym
pathy in time of sorrow.
Resolved, That the charter of lccal
So. Ml of F. E. & C. U. of A. be
draped in mourning for a period of
thirty days.
Resolved, That a copy of these res
olutions be sent to the bereaved fam
ily: one copy sent to the Wa-Keenev
World; one copy sent to the Farmers'
Union paper for publication, and one
copy placed on our minutes.

Tom McNeal in the last Mail and
Breeze has a magnificent article on
''Kansas on Her Fifty-fith Birthday."
But like many other writers when he
gets into figures makes some astound
ing deductions. For instance, he says
the 2 1-2 billion bushels of wheat that
have been produced in Kansas would
if , made into - pancakes cover the
whole of North and South America,
the battle grounds of Europe, and
leave enough to give a good dinner to
all'the Chinese, all the ladies. and the
Japs thrown in. -
Mr. Harlan in writing to McKeal
says: i'Sow, Mr. MeNeal, I agree
with you most heartily on most of
your ideas and statements but when
you come to the pancake question I !
will have to part company altogether,
unless you spread your batter consid
erably thinner than I am accustomed
to get at home.

iio iwara. iji v visit at uie oia
home last October was made because
it was feared my father mitrht not
last - through the whiter, but it was
thought mother had a fair promise of
several comfortable rears to come.
Now an old man is left to stumble
along alone. His condition is such
that he daily faces sudden death.
But I shall not pity my father too
much. I know that he must feel
lonely, feeble and broken, but I also
know that it cannot be for long and
that he shall not want for any mat
erial thing during his remaining
days. He still loves life, but he
contemplates death with serenity.
He has facerf imminent death before
and no man ever saw him quail.
I know that he will quit life peace
fully and acquit himself creditablr.
His step is feeble, but his faith is
firm and his feet have ever been in
the right way.
Mother is dead, and the old home
can never be quite the same again,
even for those who live at a distance.
For thirty-eight- years, every few
days I have written to the home
folks, and while for years my father
has been too feeble, and others might
forget to answer, mother was the one
who never forgot and never failed
except the last time and even then
she asked another to write and tell
me why she could not respond. And
such letters! All the little details
of homely home news; of crops and
weather; of life and death; of - trouble
and sorrow; of birth and marriage;
of joy and happiness; reminding me
of friends and neighbors who had al
most faded from my memory and
introducing others whom I shall
never really know. I shall hear from
her no more and it will be a long
time before I can become accustomed
to the change.

EDITOR BURR "CALLS" BOYD
The Phillipsburg Post, democratic
organ of Phillips county, seems to be
worrying a whole lot about the repub
lican congressional situation, which
apparently, is not being conducted in
a manner to meet with the approval
of the editor of that paper. It would
seem no more than friendly courtesy
to suggest to OoL Boyd that possibly
the wise thing for him to do is to lay
low and let the republicans go ahead
blindly, select the wrong candidate,
ball tilings all up, and render their
defeat simple and easy. But, of
course, any one as bright as Mr. Boyd
must have surely thought about that!
The only plausible answer then seems
to point to the conclusion that demo
crats more particularly democrats
with postofifices do not relish Otis
Benton as a republican canidate.
Benton is a winner, in fact, the one
man who can jar loose the job from
the jobber. That perhaps in a
measure explains why democratic
editors in the district and particularly
those with postoffices are so greatly
perturbed about events which appear
at first glance to be none of their
blamed business. Will Burr in
Almena Plaindealer, Jan. 6th, 1916.

County Superintendent Resigns
Miss Stradal has resitrned her office
and accepted a position in the Colo
rado schools. Her resignation takes
effect the end of this quarter in
March. She wishes to attend the
State Teachers' college in Greeley, a
few months in order to get a general
survey of school work in that state
before taking up her new duties.
Miss Stradal has been a county su
perintendent of great efficiency and
has given a great deal or time and
labor to her work. She has been a
tireless worker and has accomplished
much that will not perish by her
leaving but will grow and bring forth
results of lasting good. Our associa
tion with Miss Stradal while in office
have been most harmonious and
pleasant and we as well as her host of
friends throughout Trego county re
gret to see her leave but hope that in
her new field of labor she will meet
with all prosperity and happiness
and that her endeavor may be crown
ed with the same splendid success
that was hers while superintendent
of public instruction of Tregocounty.
Last week, the Home Mercantile
Investment Company advertised in
The News a stock of goods to be sold
at half price, and to be closed out with
in a week. Monday evening, the day
of the opening of the new store, A.
P. HInsbaw & Son, of Wa-Keeney,
arrived in this city, and purchased
the stock, complete, with which to
start their own new store at Wa
Keeney. Consequently, the goods
weie promptly repacked for shipment.

strong after the trade opened. -The
feature was some prime natives, a
three car drove arriving, from which;
a load could of been sorted out cap

sold together, at $8 60, avarage weight
1568 lbs. Some sugar mill steers from
Scottsbluff weighting 1170 lbs sold at
$7.75, considered a verr sLt.tnwt.iwe,
price for the drove.. Medium class fed -steers
ranged downwards to $7.50,
and plain steers around $7.00, but
there is a better feeling this week.
Some of the commission men have
written to their customers predicting
a good rise in beef cattle prices In the
next thirty days. Receipts today
were 9000 head, and estimates for
tomorrow are light, indicating mod
erate supplies ahead. Best cows sell

to $7.75, a few up to $3.50, bulls have
a wide range at $5 to $6.50, veal calves

Russell, where they met the Russell
High School team, who are being
coached by our former coach, Mr
Reppert. In a rough but very ex
citing game Trego came out with a
larger score, being 26 to 13. Several
of the players were put out of the
game on personal fouls, Hoelk of
Russell and Krhut of Wa-Keeney.
Friday morning the team left for?
WUson where they played Friday
evening. Our boys won by a score
of 38 to 22. in a clean fast game. The
Wilson boys showed their good sports
manship although one of their men .
was put out on a personal foul. On
Thursday evening arter the Rassell
game Mr. Reppert did not seem to
be satisfied with the game so a game
was arranged to be played Saturday
evening on the way back from Wil
son. He promised he would give the
boys a better game believing his boys
could win by a cleaner game but to
the contrary. That is the kind of
Basket Ball T. C. H. S. Is used to
playing as they were able to win from
Russell by a score of 54 to 21. Wil

evening, February 5th. Come out
and help the boys have a champion
