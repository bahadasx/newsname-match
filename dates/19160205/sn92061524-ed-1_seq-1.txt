- HORSETHIEF CAPTURED
Deputy Sheriff R. C. Grunig net
up with an unusual incident at the
beginning of his term of office as
deputy sheriff. Monday morning he
was called on to take , in custody one
Roy Walker, who was charged Tsith
having issued worthless checks and
getting a sum of money in change
when paying small bills with larger
checks.
' When arrested Walker insisted that
he was ready to give up and quit the
game. He announced that he was a
horsethief from Amarillo, Texas, and
was wanted badly there he was tired
of the game and wanted to go back
and take his sentence. He talked
freely of his past, in fact bo freely
that most of his hearers thought him
either romancing er demented, but he
convinced the officer that there was
a lot of truth in his story and the
sheriff at Amarillo was wired regard
ing him and came back at once with
the request to hold the man till he
came for him. , . .
' Among the stories told by Walker
to the officers, was that he had thirty
head of T. E. Mitchell's horses hidden
in a safe retreat and guarded by some
of his men.. He claimed to have a
number of American and Mexican as
sociates and to be the head of a large
organized band of outlaws, that he
had been stealing horses as a profes
sion for over five years and that, he
gave up voluntarily because he was
tired of it. . ,
It is too bad this man is not a writ
er. If his story is true it is as strange
or stranger than any fiction and if
he is dreaming it is still good fiction
with a moral to it in either case it
would be better reading than a Jot of
the slush we. get in the modern mag
, azines. .' v "
Telegraphic . arrangements were
made with Sheriff W. M. Burwell, of
Amarillo, for Deputy Granig to take
his man to Tucumcari Monday evening
where he was met by the sheriff and
taken on to Amarillo. F. A. Roy wir
ed T. E. Mitchell regarding his horses
and Mr. Mitchell received the message
at Tucumcari and interviewed Walker
. while there. He will investigate fur
ther before taking any action. '
The saddle he turned over to Elmer
. Evans he claimed he had stolen from
R. T. Churdiill of Oklahoma,-and the
horse he claimed belonged to another
horse-thief. . . ,
Walker gave two aliases, one as H.
II. Hill and the other Mr. Johnson.
His line of talk at first was calcu
lated to mislead his hearers but there
was so much of truth in it as to com
mand respect. All who. talked with
him were convinced before he léf t that
his repentance was genuine and that
he really wants to atone for his ca
reer and start, right. He is still a
young man and has time ahead for
part of a useful life.
It is believed there will, be quite a
shaking up in horse thief circles over
his surrender as he is evidently a
prominent member of the profession.
Jasper Nutter came down from Dáw.
son Wednesday to visit his parents and
' attend business matters. '
Tony Chaves, the Albert merchant,
was in Roy Wednesday and a welcome
caller at .this office.

The death of Charles Kohn, of Mon
toya, at Kansas City, last Sunday
while on his bridal tour, following his
marriage last Wednesday, and the
death of his brother, George Kohn at
Tucumcari, following the news of his
death, Wednesday morning, brings
sorrow to the friends of the Brothers
here as well as at their home. The
three Kohn Brothers have been prom
inent in business circles in the state
and they are rated among the most
wealthy and useful men of the state.
The death of the two brothers under
such distressing conditions and when
life held most for them, is most re
grettable.. WE SIMPLY , FORGOT
Some way a lot of news got past us
last week and the trouble was, it was
all important news that belonged in
the recorded history of the town.
Foremost of these occurrences was
the birth of a fine girl to Mr. and Mrs.
George Tower last Monday. It wasn't
our fault that we didn't know it.
George was too bashful to tell us
but Grandpa Tower made it right by
coming in person with the good news.
Here's greeting the little lady. May
she grow and wax strong like her
elder brother. .
The next oversight was the return
of Mrs. Abernathy from an extended
visit with relatives in Iowa and taking
a course of medical treatment. She
came in a week ago Saturday looking
well and quite herself again. She ex
perienced a temperature of 44 de
grees below zero on Tuesday and left
in a downpour of rain Friday. Such
were the weather conditions which
decided her never to visit Iowa again
except in the fall and made her ap
preciate home and New Mexico and
G. R. and the Ford car and the mild
weather and the many other blessings
she has here. Especially the new bed
room whicHTMr. A. had added to their
ranch home during her absence.
We' also forgot to. call your atten
tion to the- S-AV 13th birthday and
thát we started on . Vol. 13 last week.
Of course much "of the history of the
town and community has never, been
recorded and much is better forgotten
and much of what was published as
news was not as the majority saw it
but it has been a factor in the history
of the town never the less and we have
the last four years files preserved so
they are accessable. As the best of
the, history , of the town has been
made during these years we are rather
proud of the part we have played in
recording it, and, so long as condi
tions" remain as pleasant as in , the
past we. shall probably stick to it
The nasty places along the way have
only served to accentuate the pleas
ant things that. are associated . with
this office, and publication. ,
. S. S. CONVENTION
The regular "Fifth Sunday Con
vention" held in the Christian church
at Roy last Sunday drew the usual
large crowd. The church was filled
to its seating capacity and the session
throuout was very interesting.
The sermon in the morning by Dr.
Bright, Presiding Elder of the M. E.
Conference, was one of the most in
teresting features. The theme was
"You must pay the price" and the
eloquent Dr. made incursions into
many zones of thought looping back
from each to rivet the central thought
firmly in the. minds of his hearers,
and impress it from so many angles
that no one could fail to have a focus
on his subject no matter what his en
vironment. The basket dinner was
held in the church as it was just a
little too cold to spread the tables
outside.
The afternoon program was ani
mated and devoted chiefly to discus
sion of S. S. problems but several
clever little juvenile songs and other
entertainment features were present
ed. The reports from the schools rep
resented showed a very live condition
and there was positive enthusiasm
over the ' decision to meet with the
Milla S. S. in April.
Rev. Hall as president, ably assist
ed by Mr. Elder as vice and abetted
by Mrs. George Lucas, the efficient
secretary and Miss Olga Nelson, the
trusty treasurer, all of whom have
time to spare from the details of their
executive duties to take an active part
in the discussions. Rev. Hearn dis
played a marked aptitude for presid
ing over the Round Table discussion,
summing up the thought very fairly
at the end, of each' subject
" the' State-wide contest among S.
S. Children in writing Temperance es
says was discussed at? length and it
was decided that the Association enter

- CHRISTIAN CHURCH .'"
The pastor of the Christian church
will begin a series of sermons on the
great doctrines . of the Bible. . Next
Sunday morning the subject will be
"God." To get the most out of these
sermons it is advisable that everyone
should attend regularly and not miss
any of them, although each sermon
will be a separate subject in itself.
The pastor will preach next Sunday
afternoon at the Pleasant View school
house immediately after Sunday
school. All are invited to these ser
vices. . O. W. HEARN, Pastor
ANOTHER DEAD MAN
FOUND AT MILLS
. Judge Foster and Constable Grunig
were called to Mills again Thursday
morning to investigate another corpse
found in the canyons Thursday morn
ing by Messrs. Taylor and Dormán,
two young men who are staying up in
the vicinity of the Mills ranch.
The young men report the body as
having apparently been dead for some
time and it is believed to be the body
of one Clyde Wiggins,' who was miss
ing some four or five months ago and
the mystery surrounding his disap
pearance has never been solved.
Investigation will be made of the
affair and if we are to accept the be
lief of some people who do not care
to be quoted fearing more tragedies,
there is some developments very near
the surface.
Clyde Wiggins was foreman on the
Mills Ranch at the time of his disap
pearance and his home was Dallas,
Texas. Many reports were current at
the' time some indicated foul play and
others that horses were missing at the
same time.
The S-A. received a hunch at the
time that an investigation would de
velop foul play, but it was imprac
ticable to follow it up. V
' It is to be hoped the mystery will
be cleared up. . .
The finding of the Corinor'g Jury was
co the effect that it was the body of
Clyde Wiggins who disappeared last Ju
ly that he had beed shot as evidenced
by a bullet found in the skull and the
body concealed in in an almost inacces
able spot in the canyons by unhallowed
hands in the hope that the evidence of
the crime might be hid and his murder
ers escape the hand of justice, , , -
We are in receipt of a copy of the
"Cummins". Presidential Boom issued
from the State Republican Committee
at Des Moines, Iowa, with an urgent
urge to "Do something."
Lord! What can á Democrat in New
Mexico do for a Republican in Iowa?
Save perhaps to indulge in reminis
cences of the good old days when Mr.
Cummins put it over in spite ef us
"Stand-Patters."
Mrs. P. C. Haines, a sister to the
Leach family here, arrived last week
and is making an extended visit with
her mother and the rest of them.. She
talks of remaining here and having
her husband come from Ft Scott,
Kansas, where he has a position as
expert harness maker.
MERICLE COONROD
William P. Mericle and Miss Isla
E. Coonrod, both of Mills, were mar
ried in the: office of the county clerk
on Wednesday afternoon. This young
couple jointly own an extensive farm
near Mills, and start life auspicious
ly. Both came to New Mexico from
Illinois, ,, the groom eight years ago
from Chester, and the bride five years
ago from Palmyra, and both have
"made good." Mrs. Mericle is a grad
uate of the high school at Greenfield
111. We extend best wishes to these
promising young people.. The Raton
Range.
J. Bacil Proctor sends us a copy of
the State College ?'Round-UpM issued
by the Students of the. N. M. Agricul
tural College which fairly teems with
good stuff which we would like to
copy if we could. Bácil is down at the
collegé this winter learning the why
of things he ha? already discovered
on the homestead and is making a wise
move for a young farmer who is am
bitious to make a winning on the
farm. '
