Jterial Conference at which prime min
sters of all of the British colonies
and dominions will be present, togeth
er with the British cabinet, Hon. W.
M. Hashes, premier of the Common
wealth of Australia, spent this morn
ing in Honolulu, arriving at 8:15
o'clock, and departing at noon on the
liner Makura for .Vancouver, unusn
' : ' " Columbia. " t ..
- Every, effort was made to keep the
. identity of. tha Australian statesmaa
" ; a secret. Mr. Hughes himself first de
' . n fed that he was the premier of the
,- commonwealth, and later assumed an
absolute silence, refusing to respond
' to queries by so much as a nod or a
.. - shake of the bead.: '" ' :
Concerning his mission In London
' V ' no one In the Hughes entourage would
,' talk; but other passengers on the liner
" and Australian newspapera of recent
" date say that the trip is being made

. . premiers, and that the question of the

From the Austrilian tUndpoint the
eventual disposition of the former Ger
man Pacific possessions is of prime
importance, and it is generally ac-
. cepted In Australia that Mr. Hughes'
main object is to make known Aus
tralia's views regarding the disposal.
v of strategical Pacific Islands captured
.from Germany, as well as to promote
the idea of a closer commercial union
: of British colonies. ,.
' Mr. Hughes departure from' Austra-
Jla was cloaked with mystery. He left
Melbourne for Sydney, where he made
several speeches. While at Sydney it
was given out that he would sail" from
Adelaide on the R. M. S. Ostertey, for
London, going via Suez. He and his
party .left Sydney on a special train,,
supposedly. bound for Adelaide.-There
were farewell speeches, and bands at
the railway station when he depart-
ed, and rcce; tiers had been planned
along the proposed route but the hos
pitable towns were disappointed.
, Get. Wireless to Stop.. .
Shortly after leaving' Sydney the
liner Makura received a wireless to
stop off Watson's Bay, seven miles
from Sydney, and await passengers.
Officers of the liner had no Inkling
who was to board the ship.
; . While lying seven- miles off shore,
. and about seven miles from the Syd
ney pier, the vessel was overtaken by
.a launch which contained the Hughes
party, who had left their special Adelaide-bound
train at Watson's Bay. '

'. Enlargements Considered
If - assurances are . given -, that the
lllll. aiaerwCreaCWorthcrnMs. to-t
kept .on the ' run to Honolulu through
next season, this- city will, see: an en
largement of existing hotels which will
be ample to take care of the additional
tourist trade. : - ,. !
E. G. Duisenberg of the Pleasanton
Hotel Company took this message to
Cal E. Stone of iw Great Northern
Pacific Steamship Company, when ho
waa on the coast, and Stone told Mr.
Duisenberg that a daflnite announce
ment would be made within three
weeks. That was li) days ago. -t
This afternoon T. B. Thjele, manager
of the properties of the Territorial Ho
tel Company, authorised, the announce
ment that his company has under con
sideration 'plans for a very consider
able ' enlargment of their accommoda
tions at the Moana and Seaside hotels
at . Walkiki beach plans , which will
most certainly be carried out if the
Hill liner Is kept on the run, to the
Islands. ' -' -
Honolulu will continue to have the
advantages of the advertising that the
Sll Interests are giving the islands
d the service furnished ) by their
boats, in the opinion of Mr. Duisen
berg, who had several talks with Cal
Stone; 4 '.
MMrl Stone asked me to tell the peo
ple of the islands that If the business
warranted, if they obtained the neces
sary passenger and freight business,
the Great Northern would be kept on
her run," Mr. Duisenberg declared.
"Judging from the amount of .' ad
vertising known to be in course of
preparation by the Hill people, and
the amount of money they are spend
ing,.! would say that they have defi
nitely decided to put one. If not two,
boats on this run next season. They
are booked nearly full for every sched
uled voyage of the Great Northern and
it is unnecessary for them to do any
more advertising tnls season. . . v
"I want to say this for Cal Stone
the advertising he haa done during the
last three months haa helped the isl
ands more than all the advertising
done In their history before. - The
amount of information he haa spread
about Hawaii throughout the United
States is wonderful." ; . " ? ,
BOTH BIG HILL UNERSi
FOR ISLAND RUN; SMALL
NEW VESSELS ON COAST
Two smaller ships, now building on
the Atlantic coast, will make the
Portland-San Francisco run next sea
son, leaving the two big Hill-liners,
the Great Northern and the Northern
Pacific, free to make the Honolulu
run, according to the latest rumor to
reach Honolulu from the mainland.
A well-knowon local business man.
who waa talking to Cal Stone the day
the Great Northern left San Fran
cisco on her last trip, stated - that
there was a well-defined rumor on
the coast that there waa not enough
business on the coast run for the big
boats now that the exposition was
over, while the Honolulu business had
exceeded all expectations. . .
As a consequence, according to the
rumor, both of the big boats will be
put on the Island run as soon as the
smaller ones are ready for the coast
trip. '. ;. -f

HILO, Hawaii, Feb. 4. That the isl
and of Hawaii will be represented at
the Honolulu Carnival by a "princess"
and all the attendant features of that
kind of a pageant, was decided upon
at the meeting of the directors of the
Hilo Board of Trade that was held
on Tuesday last when it was moved,
seconded and carried that a committee
of one be appointed to get busy at once
and arrange for a young lady to be
secured to take the part of the "princess.-
Accordingly, C. C Kennedy waa
appointed as the committeeman and
he is getting busy on the proposition.
The board of directors realizing tnat
the time is very short, as the Mid
Pacific Carnival begin on February 21,
decided to take it for granted that the
board, as a whole, will back up the
proposition of having this island rep
resented by a princess. They, there
fore, went ahead with the scheme and
it is very apparent that there will be
a great rush to attain the result de
sired. 5 The lady wno wiu represent
Hawaii will have to be in Honolulu'
for at least one week before the Car
nival begins, and that means that she
will have to leave Hub on Monday,
