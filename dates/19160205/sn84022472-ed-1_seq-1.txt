t, lary Lansing will confer with
President Wilson today over
-the new tentative form of set
tlement of th&,. Lusitania case,
submitted yesterday by Count
Vori Bernstorff, the German
ambassador. Meanwhile, the
secretary said the situation is
-..unchanged. x - .' ' .!,
It was said in official quar
' trs that sqme anhouncement
might be made within the next
fiw days. V,"
Count Von Bernstorff had no ap
pointment today to confer with Sec-
" retary Lansing but was holding him-
, self in readiness to go to the state
department whenever his presence
Wight be required. , --
Apparently, the stumbling block is
the word "illegal" asdifferently inter-
preted in this country and "Germany.
The Berlin government's answer pro
poses instead of a flat admission ipf il
legality of the method, of submarine
' warfare ineinking the llnei1, the accep
tance of liability for the loss of neu-
tra'l lives which Germany hopes will
be satisfactory to the United States.
Berlin, Feb. 6 -There are no' new
developmentsfhere today-'in the Lusi
tanla case. News is being- awaited
from Washington. WiJ:h regard to the-j
. .proposals or aecreiary jjunanio v
subject of submarine warfare and the
arming of merchantment The Asso
ciated "Press is authoritatively inform
ed that tMcy hanot so tar been .
x submitted to Germany.
The press -continues to diAsuss the
cabled report regarding those propos
als of Mr. tensing. Ttie Koelnische
Volks Zeitung, an organ ,ot the Cath
oHc party, says that -the proposals are
absolutely Inace&ptab-le, as their, ac
, ceptance would signify the abandon
ment of the entire German submarine
campaign against the commerce of the
allies. . . - ' '
With regard to the Lusitania ques--tlon,
the Volks Zeitung says that,
if Mr. Wilson is correctly reported as
demanding .: that ' Germany recognize
that the sinking. of the Lusitania was
illegal and unjustified by the. theory of
reprisals, then there can be only on
answer a flat, refusal. -'
The tension created by the latest
developments in the' Lusitania case
evidently,' Is lessening. Most ; of the
afternoon, papers do not discuss the
. situation today. ., The Kreuz Zeitung,
however, says it Is necessary to em
phasize the reasons -which should In
fluence Chancellor Von Bethmann
Hollweg in deciding not to- meet de
mands of the United States. -. v ' . ,
- The Germanla recalls - the ' fact that
"Feb. 4. is the anniversary of the issu
ance -of the German proclamation es
tablishing a war zone at 'the- British
Isles. It aays the most important con
equencewas destruction of the Lusl
1 tania.
"This case, so far from being set
tled, has reached an especially critical
point," the .article continues. "We
cannot understand what moved Amer
ica to take her present stand. It is
Tnost certain that the sinking of- the
Lusitania was absolutely within the
provisions of the German - acclamation
and the inference is that there can be
no talk of illegality unless our com
mercial war roundabout Great Brit
ain is to be deprived of its basis."

STRAND THEATRE
, UNION TROUBLES
ALL AT AN END
Berger Contributes $200 To
' ChsHtfes As" Evidence of
His Gopd'WilL
' Differences, between the local build
ing trades and. the'- Strand.' theatre,
1414 Main street, were adjusted today
to the satisfaction of a committee rep
resenting the Central Labor union
and Building Trades council, and. the
owner and lessee of thetheatre Chas.
J. Berger and ' P; T. Kontos,, respec
'tively, when Mr, Berge- agreed to
contribute $200 to local charities.
The two hospitals of the city, -St.
Vincent's and the Bridgeport, will
share in Mr. Berger's donation. He
wrote checks for $100 in favor of each
.institution, and turned them over to
newspapers to be given to., the hos
pitals. The checks have been for
warded to the institutions. ,
The : Strand theatre, an attractive
playhouse devoted to motion pictures,
was completed by men who were not
affiliated with the local building trades
unions. Naturally, the union work
men felt resentment. .
When .Mr. Berger's attention was
called to this fact, recently rthrough
P. T, Kontos, the -new lessee of the
theatre, he expressed his willingness
to do anything , within reason to re
store good feeling 'between the union
trades and himself. As a result, con
ferences were arranged, and last even
ing a plan satisfactory all around was
-evolved.
Mr. Berger expressed his willingness
to contribute to any worthy cause, as
an evidence of his good feeling to
wards union principles. The Cen
tral Labor union could not receive the
cash, as a matter of principle. The
unions would mot, even if they could
take the money for the workers on the
building, , for . they were not affiliated
with their organizations. Charity
was designated as an alternative. .
Mr. Berger visited The Farmer ' of
fice with Kontos and the committee,
John J. -O'Neil, Martin L. Kane and
Charles Stout. They explained the
satisfactory adjustment of their dif
ferences and asked The Farmer to see
that the funds reached their proper
destinations. . - . ,

SIMON LAKE HAS
GASOLINE ENGINE
FOR SUBMARINES
Claims to Have Invention
Which Obviates Former
Impossibilities.
NOXIOUS GASES ARE
WHOLLY DISSIPATED
Air Under, Compression Fed
Into Engine As It
x Is Needed.
Danger from noxious gases emanat
ing from gasoline or heavy oil burning
engines in submarines has been ob
viated according "to mechanical ex
perts who have viewed the recent in
vention of mon Lake, head of the
Lake Submarine Boat Company of
this city, to whom a patent was issued
by the government on Feb. 1.
Under , serial 1,169,959 are allowed
the claims of the inventor to an en
gine in which an air compressor is
operated for supplying the necessary
air for the combustion" chamber. The
patent also provides for an individual
arrangement of auxiliary exhaust ports
to take care 'of the gases that may es
cape around the piston rings of the
cylinder, thereby making the engine
particularly adaptable for submarine
use, or in any boats where the escap
ing gases may pass from the engine
room to any other part of the boat.
As is shown in : negotiations with
the patent office, Mr. Lake is un
doubtedly the first person to provide
for - this emergency and his invention
was developed through personal un
derwater experience of; perilous na
ture.- I
"The applicant has observed," says
part of -the original application "from
practical experience that when nsing
internal combustion engines in sub
marine boats or other places where
little chance for air circulation exists,
the burned gas escapes into the en
gine room:- This . oftentimes is ; to
such an extent as to drive the engineer
from his post. ..The escape of this
gas has been traced to the crant'ease
of the engine or t the.'cylinder which!
1 . ' a2 A
Mr. Lake has found that providing
a cylinder, with a. set of auxiliary or
leakage ports positioned at a point
in the cylinder below the lowest point
of travel of the piston the-escape of
the gases into the boat may be avoid
ed.' . - '. .
BUDLQNG TIRES
OF GIViilG CASH
TO FigST VIFE
Claims To Have Paid Her
$6,000 Alimony Instead
of $2,000.
Declaring thai, he has already paid
her over $6,000 on a $2,000 'judgment
for alimony, Assistant 1 General Man
ager Herbert AC Budlong of . the
American Graphophone Co., is fight
ing the effort of his first wife, Char
lotte Budlong of Washington, D. . C,
to collect back alimony. There were
arguments on motions in the common
pleas court yesterday afternoon on the
suit brought, , by Mr. .Budlong but
Judge Scott reserved decision.
The plaintiff in this action was Bud
long's first wife and he has been
married" twice sinoa. When she ob
tained a divorce in this city in 1906
she got. a judgment against Budlong
for $2,000 alimony He did not wish
to pay this in a lump sum so an agree
ment was - drawn whereby Budlong
was to pay her $75 a month so long as
she lived and remained single.
This money was paid regularly un
til the amount- had greatly exceeded
the original judgment -of $2,000; Last
July Budloner rTed paying -, and
dlong began suit . to recover
the amounts &he .ns nave since be
come due. Through her personal
counsel. Attorney Robert G. DeFprest,
she maintains that Budlong should
abide by the terms of the written con
tract he made with heri
, Attorney - I. j Cohh, . representing
Budlong, declares that when Bud
long made the contract it was agreed
Mrs. Budlong should release the
$2,000 judgment but t is claimed she
has failed to do this. So Budlong
filed a counter claim to recover all
he has paid in excess -of $2,000, At
torney Deforest filed a demurrer to
this and Judge Scott took the papers.
The third Mrs. Budlong recently
brought suit for divorce but the case
was dismissed after a sensational trial
in which Budlong contested his wife's
action.

JURORS IN

STILL OU
Deliberations on Fate of
Physician's Wife and Two
Negroes Begun After Brief
Charge By Judge, i .
Court Instructs Jury That
Sympathy For Woman
Defendant Must Not En-
1 ter Their Deliberations.
Providence, R. I.,.- Feb
After three hours' deliberation,
the jury in the ctase of Mrs.
Elizabeth' F. Mohr, G. Victor
Brown and Henry H. "Spellman,
charged with the murder of
Dr. C. Franklin Mohr, the
woman's husband, was still out
when the court recessed for
luncheon.
The case went to the jury at
10:45 o'clock after beuig charg
ed by .Judge Stearns.; No word
had come from the jury roprr
up. to the reces's. .
Judge Stearns in his charge to the
Jurydeclared that it was their duty
if they concluded the state had proven
its case to say "guilty, whatever tne
consequences, in each case or in any
case '
The law recognizes no color, no
creed," the court "said.. "Pay no re
gard to the factthat one" defendant la
a woman and two are- colored men.
They are three citizens on trial and I
charge you not to allow any prejudice
or feeling, . excepting -an 1 honest desire
to do impartial justice, to enter your
minds."'
"'Mrs. Mohr has been; indicted as an
accessory before the fact. If you find1
she hirod, aided, procured, or assistod
one orboth of the other detfendanlv
he continued, "she is guilty."
.Referring to the claim by counsel
that it worked a hardship and unfair
ness to the- defendants to-Jbe tried to
gether, the court said, i nope not. iz
does; not always work a hardship. But
this Is -a responsibility assumed by the
court,"; . 5 .';"' ' .V" -
Judge Stearns then.-"? 'stplairied' the
degree of proof necessary ,to convict,
saying: v ,'."v ' -.-..'.
"All three ; defendants are indicted
together, hut you will bring in three
verdicts. You will- be- asked if Brown
isgtiilty; if Spellman is guilty; and if
Mrs. Mohr is guilty. The verdicts will
be individual as though there haM
been three separate trials."
The court asserted that under 1he
law an accessory cannot be convicted
unless one or both of the principals
are found guilty and. therefore that it
was logicalthat the jury first deter
mine if Brown and Spellman, were
guilty. . . -
Taking up a discussion of the evi
dence, the cbturt first directed atten
tion to the testimony of George W
Healis, Dr.- Mohr'i chauffeur, ' who
turned state's evidence. . v
"How much reliance is to be placed
on. the testimonyLiof an accomplice?"
asked the . court. "That rests with
you. Healis i3 a puzzling figure in
this case. It's a fair question how
much of his statement is true and
how much is false."
"If s been argued," the court said,
"that Brown and Spellman were Jok
ing when they were told how they
threw the gups away. All I have to
say is . this, that if a man sees fit to
joke about ' something after - he's
charged with murder he has got no
one but himself to ' blame if he is tak
en seriously." f
The court . said no confession was
made by Mrs. Mohr but that, accord
ing to the state, she had made threats
against .; her husband a- number" oi
times. It ,was up to tb Jury to de
termine, the value of 4 these alleged
threats, the court -said.
Judge Stearns declared that confes
sions were only to be taken as? against
the persons making them. Therefore,
he said, the - alleged confessions of
Brown and Spellman were not to be
considered as against Mrs. Mohr.
The court advised the jurors not to
talk to newspapermen after a verdict
had been rendered.
Upon request of counsellor the de
fense the court charged the jury that
there was ho evidence that the estate
of Dr. Mohr was paying for the de
fense of Brown and. Spellman.
When theJury reUred Mrs. Mohr
left the courtroom with her attorneys
and the two negro defendants were
taken to their cells.
The Jury was still deliberating at l
o'clock. Mrs. Mohr left the court
room shortly after the judge's charge
was concluded, although a large
crowd remained, evidently' with ' the
expectation, that an early verdict
would be brought in. Judge Stearns
left the pourthouse at 12:45 o'clock,
at which hour luncheon was ordered
for the jury. (

Forrest E. Ellman, Bridge
porter, One of Heirs of
Vast Fortune.
NINETY-NINE YEAR
LEASE HAS EXPIRED
Land , In Philadelphia and
Oil City Included In Tre
mendous Estate.
Forrest J3. Elleman, a clerk in
Meigs Co. and living at 44 Lewis St.
is elated. His elation is most natural
for he has just been informed that
he may participate in the division of
an $80,000,000 estate eighty million.
Not only is this amount of money
almost beyond the grasp of the imag
ination, but according to reports from
Troy, Ohio, where first intimation of
the possibility arose, 'the manner in
which it devolves upon the heirs qf
one Marmaduke Coate is unique and
shows that leases made for a century
sometimes are called even in the pres
ent age. It is believed that this lease
made for 99 years, is the first to be
called at ' expiration in I , the United
States. What action the courts will
take and how much of the present
property will revert to the heirs are
questions that may make a famous
case in the courts of this country.
Forrest Elleman of .this city, has
been a clerk in this city for about
three years, prior to which he worked
in. large 'New York stores and cameJ
from Ludlow Falls, Ohio.
' He recently received word , from
Philadelphia lawyers that he was one
of the heirs to an estate in C11 City,
which is in litigation. "He was .later
advised by his relatives in New York
State that he would be expected to
aid ifa the fight.
According to ' information from
Ohio , and printed Jan. 29 in Dayton,
W. ' R. EHeman, of West Milton, Ohio,
a clerk in the county auditor's office
discovered a lease in the archives that
had' expired. Its perusal showed that
several; well known -Miami 'county
families may share in an $80,000,000
estate in Pennsylvania through the
provision of the 99 year lease clause.
The publication says "Mr. and' Mrs.
Elmer Pearson of Troy, Mr. and Mrs.
L. M. Elleman of Ludlow ' Falls, and
Mr. and Mrs. L. M. Elleman of Pleas
ant Hill, Ohio are the "persons - who
may r.share in i the . estate and with
other relatives they" have placed the
case in. -the hands of. a St. Louis at
torney, ; who is now in Philadelphia
looking- our for their - interests.,: ! .'
f "Ninety-nine years ago the ances
tors of the Ellemans and Pearsons
leased several thousand acres of what
is now the most valuable land in Penn
sylvania with the provision that at
the time the lease expired the land
with all other improvements would
revert back to the hpirs of the ori
ginal owners. '
"The . land has been developed by
the Rockefeller interests and today the
value is estimated at $80,000,000.- In
cluded in the landis the whole city
of Oil City, Penna and nearly : one
thousand acres in the city of Phila
delphia. "The ancestors of the Miami coun
ty families who procured the origiaal
lea.se are Marmaduke Coate and wife,
Arthur Coate and wfe and son, Jamesr
William P. Samanry, Caleb and Alice
Mendenhall, Eliza Fames and James
Mendenhall. ' . .
"The last two named persons were
closely related to Daniel Boone, one
of the pioneers of Ohio and Kentucky.
The lease expired last year and Just
before the holiday a relative noticed
an advertisement for the heirs of the
land published in a Philadelphia news
paper, and at once steps were taken
to locate all the heirs.- . It is pfobable
that 200 heirs will appear before the
case is brought into court The fight
for the recovery of the lands and
improvements will be made in Phila
delphia, and it may be several years
before all the litigation can be set
tied." ;
