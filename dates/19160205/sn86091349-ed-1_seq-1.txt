PEOPLE TO FEED BIRDS
From' all parts of the state com-
'ptlalnt. is heard that the late storms
haveobrught starvation to many of
the, native Mrds of Nevada, the deep
suow having, covered up their natural
supply. Right here in Pioche many
uf the feathered tribe have perish-
leid1 and a few residents have been
putting out food to keep them alive.
The seriousness of the situation!
'has been brought to the attention
of Gov. Boyle, who has issued thl
following proclamation:
"Since unusual . falls of snow have
burled the natural food of our wild

NEW LAMPS BRIGHTEN
PIOCHE FIRE STATIONS
The Pioche fire commissioners have
.aeed some real lights in front of
the three fire stations for which they (
UeserVa a gold medal. The old i oil
lanterns, which have long been a dis-
rate to 'this town, have been rele
gated t to the scrap heap and replac
ed by sjnie high candle power gaso
line lamps. There is an , alarm clock
attachment on the wire system
which! extinguishes the lights about
dav break every morning
The lights are a great improvement
and not only denote the location ofi
the fire houses, but, keep the srteets
lighted at night, A few more Bucb
1 j .jilts : scattered about town would
not be a bad idea. There, ought at
least , to be one at the Intersection
of Meadow Valley and Main streets
and, another on Lacour street in the
vicinity of the court house.

The'Il6me Run Copper company
is shaping for a very active- develop
ment campaign progress at. the
present time being held in obeyance
only by the deep snow in the vicinity
of 'the mine. However the manage
ment has a force of several men em
ployed and according to late reports
from, them the results of their work
is most gratifying for the reason that
.late devejcpments seem to indicate?
that the reiki source of the ore sup
ply t has been discovered. At least
this much is Indicated by exploita
tion made to the east on the 200
foot level.iuboth places ore having
been found containing values of from
$50 to $60' per ton, the percentage
of copper runs high.
Eastward from the shaft about 250

the) late disclosures has led the

dike has played an important' parti
in te ore maKing process wnicn nas
been going on for ages in that par
ticular! part of the Bristol district.
Granting that is the case, the probv

Progressive ; faimers use modern

Among labor-saving appliances, the
toeless cooker is of real value. Its
underlying physical law was first ap
p;ied In Norway. In 1867, at the Par

In Forceful Plea at Cleveland, Pres.
ident Wilson Says No Mn Knows
What Single Day May Bring
Forth to the Country.
Cleveland, O. President Wilson,
speaking as he said, "solemnly,"
warned the nation Saturday 1 njght
.hat the time may come when he can
not both) keep the United States out
of war and maintain its honor, :!and
declared that the counUy must be
prepared to defend itself andbe pre
pared ,at once. X
'i "America is not afraid of anybody,"
he said. "I know I reflect your reel
ing and the feeling -of all our" citizens
when I say" that the only thing I am
afraid cf is not being ready to per
form, my duty. 'I am afraid' of the
dinger of shame. I am afraid of the
danger of inadequacy. I am aJraid of
tha danger of not being ab!e to ex
press the correct character of this
:ountry with tremendous aiight and
offectlvenens whenever we are called
upon to act in the field of tlie world's
affairs."
The president spoke In Cleveland
with" mere .gravity and force than he
has shown during on of his previous
addresses' en preparedness.
Again and again the presiden
3poke cf the nation's honor. Ho de
clared tho real man believes his
honor is dearer than hiis life, aad a
nation's henor is clearer than lis
peace and comfort. He said it had
leen difficult to keep the United
states out of the war and he felt h"
aad proved he was a-'ftian of pc.ie
when possible.
For the first time during his ores
ent tour the president spoke of the
navy and the coast defenses. The
latter, he said, are good in quality.
but not : In quantity.

It-was the preslaent's fifth speech
"of the,; day. He. had journeyed from

VOLUME XLVU NUMBER 21.
The very severe weather prevailing
during the past month has greatly
hindered work on the Con. Nevada-
Utah mill which, nevertheless, han '
progressed somewhat.
The railroad had great dlficultiy
against the, snow drifted and banked
iutu cuts and at wind sheltered
places, making necessary the employ
ment of many men shoveling and
picking Ice and snow from the rails.
VUhe "Hlghline" was a hard dtodoJ
sit Ion but the line to Jackrabblt was
the greatest expense and hardship.
Washouts on the Salt Lake route
delayed the arrival of the lumber a
portion of which has arrived from
Los Angeles; there will be, eight
carloads.
This large amount is necessary be
cause the mill will ba built with.
wooden sides instead of lroni
thie roof will be wood andl iron witH
building paper detween. In this man
ner a wormeor building, will be ob
tained than were corrugated iron,
only to be used. - - ' r-
The , hiad frame of shaft No. 5
has been taken down. The , very
large timbers ef which it was com
posed will be used at several places
in the mill whree rigidity is needed
and ; where concrete would be doffl
cult. These timbers measure as
large as 20 x 20 inches and are)
splendid material.
The Iron tank which is to take tho
place of the old wooden one that for
so many years reservolred the town's
water supply, has arrived.- The pipe
lines to connect! it into the systent
have been laid.
The water coming from the mine
runs through a pipe which passes a-
01068 the mill-site. In order to rer
mote this pipe a new line has been
installed to the site of the new tank.
Concrete laying r has been begun.
The mix is made inside of the, large
blacksmith shop; the hot mine water
is used to assist in warming the.
gravel and sand. ' The forms ara
warmed with steam. After pour:
ing tha concrete is covered with can
vass ( under "which steam is run alt
nlghtand during cold days.
The 25-H P. gasoline hoist engine
at the Susan Duster shaft has been;
brought down, and will, run th
crusher and conveyor belt. .
Several pieces of machinery have
arrived and were it' not for the im
possible weather good progress would
be made.

to the dry farm; ; from there Mr,
Uarrison's brothers. Will and George,
were to make Atlanta and Geyser.
Austin after much difficulty, reached
the dry farm; . Will Garrison plough

higher than his head and landed the
pouch In the gold mining camp.
George Garrison attempted to aegotK -.

himself and horses being almost ex-'-.i ,
hausted. The .return 'mail' from At- ' ,

time. It is understood that a 12
horse outfit was started out from tha '
