LUSHANIA SITUATION GRAVE
GERMAN NEWSPAPERS WARN BERLIN TO GO SLOW
Grab a Shovel,
Folks! Let's Give
the S. E. a Lift!
THIS ii an abnormal time.
Industry, commerce and transpor
tation are temporarily paralyzed.
l|k Seattle is just starting on th e gigantic
task of wresting herself from the
clutches of the worst snow atorm in a
quarter of a century.
It is a time for sticking together.
ABOUT 125 MILES OF STREET
CAR TRACKS ARE HOPELESSLY
BURIED BENEATH SOLIDLY PACK-
I ED ICE AND SNOW.
The street car people are fighting
against odds that are almost too great
for human strategy.
They have 500 men and '*rhat equip
ment is available bucking a job that is
none too small for 10,000 men.
They are spending thousands of dol
lars in an effort to resume service.
Until their task is at leas't partly ac
complished, Seattle suffers in a thou
sand different ways.
Employers, employes amt the com
pany ALL LOSE.
v DO YOU WANT TO HE.LP?
Have you enough community spirit to
do your bit?
All right, then turn out for an hour
or to today or tomorrow ami clean the
tracks in front of your house.
IF EVERY MAN WOULD DIG IN
AND WORK FOR AN HOUR THE
PROBLEM WOULD BE SOLVED.
For no other than selfish reasons, it
would be energy wisely spent.
FORGET FOR A DAY THE OLD
WOUNDS. FORGET FOR A DAY
ANY STINGS YOU MAY HAVE SUF
FERED AT THE HANDS OIF THE SE
ATTLE ELECTRIC COMPANY.
If 10,000 men would tarn cut Sunday,
each would have to clear t€',ven and a
half feet of track to accompl, 'ah the job.
About half of the 253 mi! es of track
has already been cleaned.
WILL YOU DO YOUR BIT?
The Star and the Seattle El ectric com
pany think differently on many things
six days out of the week.
BUT SUNDAY IS THE SEVENTH!

LONDON', Feb. 5.- Reports that Germany and America
are near a rupture in relations were displayed prominently in
London papers today.
The consensu* of opinion was that physical participation
by the United States on the side of the allies would be un
desirable because it would cut off a source of ammunition
supplies, but the papers agreed that moral participation will
be of great value.
Amsterdam advices said prices in the Berlin bourse drop
ped heavily on reports that a break is impending.
Several Berlin papers were said to have pointed out that
a break m relations would probably be followed by war. 1 hey
expressed the hope that the government would consider where
the nation is drifting.
