Some Facts About Howler the Well.
Howler the Wolf belongs to a family
against which man has raged relentless
war since the beginning of things. Yet.
despite ceaseless hunting and trapping,
ne stul holds his own in many c laves.
The great Gray or Timber Wolf , wikh.
is the largest American member of the
family, once roamed all over North
America, but is now confined largely to
the West and Soutowestand to Canada,
ranging clear to the Arctic region,
where he becomes white.
Howler looks very much like a large
doz. Indeed, he is clesW relate tn
the dog tribe. He is wonderf ully keen
of scent, fleet of foot and sound of
wind. Wolves hunt mostly in packs,
especially when in pursuit of large
game. In this way they pull down deer.
elk, even the lordly moose, when they
can catch him deep snow. On the
ranges they raise havoc with cattle.
sheep and even horses.
Howler's jaws are very wide and
strong, and hi3 method of fighting is to
jump in, slash with his great teetn, and
jump out again. By nature he is a
coward, but when starving or cornered
will fight desperately. A pack will at
tack man if driven to it by hunger, and
in Russia this not infrequently happens.
Howler usually mates for life. The den
is usually in so-called bad lands where
they are not likely to be disturbed.
They will not hesitate to kill and de
vour the weak or injured of their own
pack, and in this particular are unlike
and a degree Jower than other animals, j
so the race is always strong and virile.

fearsome sounds in the forest. Thorn- j

Several dogs and cats have been
poisoned recently in Hays by some Un

posed to be protected by law in their
rights. Gay Tillotson has offered a re
