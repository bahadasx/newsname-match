corg- ance of good roads bonds to the

[twas ons remarked, "and we feel that F
tfit to we can easily demonstrate the

some- bond experts have led us to be

f ev- received from automobilists in Per
roted Louisiana, added to the revenues
state collected by the different coun
and ties for roads. The several units r
that in Louisiana pay a tax of one

as I ed with the'automobile licenses, 1
nic foots up $225.000. This sum
would be more than ample to I

The sum already available for T
the interest on the good roads For 3
L bonds, will soon be increased,
owing to the popularity of auto ForP
mobiles in the State. The auto
mobile license will double within C.
d the next sixteen months, in the Pr N
opinion of those engaged in the

A spirit of sympathy and de .

from the big convention held in G.
