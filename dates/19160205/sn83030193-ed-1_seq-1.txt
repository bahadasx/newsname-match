Tho general belief In Canada now
Is that tho fire which destroyed tho

parently an attempt to blow up the
famous Victoria Bridge at Montreal,
authorities decided to tako drastic
notion In an effort to round tin aliens
who may bo responsible, for tho sud

It was explained that the Toundlni

will bo comparatively easy. By nn
arrangement with tho railways tho

It was through this system that
Charles Strony was arrested at Wind

Strony Is n widoly known musical
director, who during tho season Just

for in the Case of the
Three Defendants.
BAN ON PREJUDICES.
Healis's Story Is Considered
the Pivotal Testimony
of the Trial.
(Spsoial from a Staff Correspondent
of The Evening World.)
PROVIDENCE, It. I.. Feb. 6. Tho
Jury In tho case of Mrs. Elizabeth
Tiffany Mohr, Victor Brown and
Henry Spcllman, accused of the mur
der last August of Dr. C. Franklin
Mohr, went to tho Jury room nt 10.15
o'clock to-day.
Tho Jury waa still out ut 1 o'clock.
When court opened this morning
there remained on1y ' tho "charge to
tlio Jury by Justice Btearns. Ho
took less than nn hour to deliver It,
The chargo was an exposition of the
law alone, with no review of tho
evidence.
Throughout tho chnrgo Mrs. Mohr,
Brown and Hpellman watched tho
Justice very closely. Tho Jury was
compelled to stand as it was given.
TliH Justice told tho Jury that Its task
was an Individual verdict In tho enso
of oach of tho threo defendants, lie
ndded:
"You will bo nsked, 'Is Brown
guilty or not guilty?" 'Is Bpollman
guilty or not guilty?' 'Is Mrs. Mohr
guilty or not guilty?' Mrs. Mohr can
not bo found guilty by you unless you
llnd Brown and .Spcllman guilty or
Brown or Spcllman qullty.
'"There Is no question that a mur
der was committed.
f'nimcoi r, twill, 1
sides has said so. In deciding this
cast tho llrst stop I should think
you'd tako would bo to decide whether
Brown and Spcllman, or Brown or
Spcllman, committed tlio crime. Then
you can tako up the question of Mrs.
Mohr and decldo whether (the pro
cured tho murder of her husband.
But the accessory cannot bo found
guilty In a higher degree than the
principals.
"So far as tho testimony In-tho
caso In concerned, If Healls Is to be
believed tho defendants and himself
wero accomplices. Now, how far may
tho testimony of nn accomplice bo
trusted? When uncorroborated such
testimony should bo accepted with
caution. It neod not bo corroborated
lu detail, but thcro should bo somo
evidence, to support it In tlio main.
"You must consider the Interest
that witnesses may havo In giving
their testimony. Hcalh had an In
terest, for Instance. Ho was a ro
luarkabbi witness, and It Is for you
to dotormtno how much of what he
told was tlio truth and how much un
truth. Vn saw him on tlio stand
and watched his demeanor and If you
did your duty you dtew something
from this as well (is from tho hlwi.
cross-exainiimtlon to which ho was
subjected.
"As to confessions, a man doesn't
toll things which incriminate him
without n reason for doing so. Pro
mises of favor, duress, any number
of things may bring about a confes
tilon. But to bo valuablo a confession
must be-voluntary. If It Is beciired
by a trick or a Ho tho law allows It
to go In.
"It you should find that the confes
sions of Brown, Spcllman and Hcills
woro obtained by threats or other-
wise, and uro not truthful, U is for'
you to consider them In that light
In ono of thu so-called coherences, it
has been ht-ld by tlio tttorncy for tho
defenso that Brown nnd Kpellrnan
were Joking. If a nun Jokes, ubout
so serious a thing aa minder ho has

It is said the President already has the proposal from Berlin before
him and wants to o over it carefully before he begins conferences with
the Secretary of State. It was pointed out that the situation was not one
which called for haste, but this very deliberation was regarded as giving
emphasis to reports as to the seriousness of the case. ,
In addition to the proposals of

port, it is said, declared tliat German public opinion strongly opposes
any aJmission that the torpedoing of the Lusitania was illegal.

the German Ambassador, the Presi
'P Peaceful relations between the two
nations balanco on a slnglo word. Thit
word was "disavowal," but now It hau
been altered to 'Illegal" because tho
German language contains no audi
term as "disavow."
It Is an amazing state of diplomacy
that after nine months of negotiaUons
and exchanges of notes over the sink
ing of tho. Lusitania It should narrow
down at thin late day to a single word,
and bring two great nations very near
to the breaking point.
It Is not inoroly a word that Presi
dent Wilson Is anxious about, but the
great principle of humanity forwhlch
he Is contending nnd which lies back
of tlio use of tho word. It Is under
stood that the President H standing
Arm upon the Lusitania note of July
SI, wherein he madn tho following de
clarations and demands, using both
tho words "disavow" and "Illegal."
"The rights of neutrals In time
of war are based upon principle,
not upon expediency, and th
principles are immutable. The
Government of tho United 8tatss,
cannot believe that the Imperial
Government will longer rafrain
from di.avwino the wanton act
of it' naval commander in sink
ing the Lusitania or from offering
reparation for the American llvsa
lost, so far as reparation can be
made, for a needless dsstructlen
of human life by an illegal act."
The main hope of otllelals Is that
Bernstorff has been given authority
by tht German Foreign Office to go
beyond the memorandum he present
ed yesterday in trying to arrange a
settlement. Secretary Lansing Indi
cated tn-dny that the situation la not
altogether hopeless.
"Is tho situation deadlocked?" ho
waa asked.
"While confidential negotiations
continue." answered tho Secrotary of
Htntc, "tlfn situation cannot bo called
deadlocked."
Count von Bernstorff had ttttls to
