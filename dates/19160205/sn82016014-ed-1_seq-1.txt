beginning of the war was ordered by
Canadian authorities today. The Do

apprehend all foreigners who left Ot

The general belief in Canada is that
the fire which destroyed the historic
parliament building was started by
German plotters. Sir Robert Borden
has intimated he is convinced the
bla.e was incendiary. Following an
oiher mysterious fire which destroyed
a big factory manufacturing supplies
for the government early today, and
what was apparently an attempt to
blow up the famous Victoria bridge at
Montreal, the authorities decided to
take drastic action in an effort to
round up aliens who may be respon

affair and demanding that we adopt a
position completely at variance with
the one we took, clearly and without

'"The chancellor will have to con

LOSES JUS CASE
W". P, Montgomery's "Loan
Shark" Prosecutions Fail.
Court Holds That He Has o
Basis for Action.
PLAINTIFF HELD FOR COSTS
Borrower Cannot Recover
Money He Has Paid
If Within the Specifications of
His Contract.
Indirectly holding that the famous
Kansas anti-loan shark statute could
not have been more favorably drawn
for money lenders if they had drafted
it themselves, T. D. Humphreys, sit
tiTio' a iudee orotem in the court of
Topeka, today denied judgment for
the plaintiff i the oe of G. F.
Graves against W. K. Seguine. The
case was the first of W. P. Montgom
ery's so-called loan shark cases to be
tried and was orougnt Dy -Montgomery,
assistant attorney general, for the
plaintiff to recover wnicn ne al
leged was collected by the defendant
in excess of 10 per cent interest on a
note.
Judgment and costs were adjudged
against Montgomery's client. Hum
phreys held tpat tne contract ana note
under which Seguine lent Graves
money was valid.
"The law," he said, "does not give
case is in fact a bill of equity." said
Humphreys in his decision. If the
plaintiff is entitled in this court it
must be in a legal and not an equita
ble action. There is no statute giving
equitable jurisdiction to the justice of
the peace courts. The court holds
that this is an action for the recovery
of payments of usurious interest. And
that being so the plaintiff must re
cover under the usury provisions of
the interest law. The contract en
tered into between the plaintiff and
defendant is not in excess of the legal
contract rate."
Humphreys then explained that the
statute does not give the right of re
covery of voluntary payments.
"hTe law." he said, "does not give
one the right to pay a demand for
which he is not legally liable and then
give him the right to recover his pay
ments back. No action will lie to re
cover money voluntarily paid with
full knowledge of the facts and cir
cumstances under which it was de
manded, though" payment may have
been made under protest."
Ed O'Neil and W. F. Montgomery
represented the plaintiff in the case
and J. J. Schenck and A. M. Thomas
the defendant.
The loan shark cases have been
hanging fire in the court of Topeka
for several months.

HOWLAND IS FOUND
He Sends Telegram to His Mother

The final chapter in the mystery
surrounding the disappearance of
Harry Howland has been unfolded.
Friends in Topeka today learned that
Mrs. J. D. Howland of Denver, mother
of the missing man, received a tele
gram from him yesterday.
In his message, which was sent from
Deming, N. M., Howland stated that
he had been with his brother, Foster,
of Buckhorn. N. M. He was en route,
he says, to Los Angeles. Cal.. and will
be joined there later by his brother.
According to the telegram, Howland
is enjoying good health and apparent
ly is feeling better than at any time in
the last few months.
Howland. who for nearly a year
was advertising agent for the Santa
Fe with headquarters in Topeka. mys
teriously disappeared two weeks ago.
Since the sudden death of bis wife and
child several months ago, he had been
suffering from a severe mental strain
and frequently expressed a desire to
get away from, the associations of the
last few years.
Friends believe that Howland will
locate permanently on the coast.

The Hague, Feb. 5. Dutch newspa
pers both pro-German and anti-German

the Dutch tank steamer Artemis by a
German torpedo boat in the North sea.
The newspapers call for punishment

act of war against The Netherlands.

The Nieuw Courant treats the case
as a breakdown of the vaunted Ger
man organization and discipline which,
it says, seems urgently to need im
provement, especially from the view
point of the safety of lives and prop
erty of neutrals. It demands com
pletely pecuniary and political satis
faction from Germany and asks:
"Did the German flotilla propose to
remove all ships from the neighbor
hood of a sinking Zeppelin and fire
wildly and blindly when its plan did
not seem to succeed?" This it says
might explain the act, though in no
wise excusing it.

A stiffening of President Wilson's
opposition to the British blockade
against American goods shipped to
neutral ports is expected by some sen

reached Pine Bluif today, told an in
teresting tory of the manner in which
the convicts nearly 800 of them
were handled in the flood of the Ark
ansas which for a time threatened to
urown more than 400 of them.
When it was learned at the farm
that the front levees would not with
stand the flood pressure, orders w era
given for the negroes to move. A dry
floor appealed more to the blacks,
however, than thoughts of safety and
they openly rebelled. Clubs and straps
were used by the few white men left
on the farm. During the transfer a
white guard fell into the water. This
further increased the fears of the ne
groes. After several hours of stren
uous coercion, the blacks were driv-
' en from the stockade to the top of the
j levee.
