Many redhot fights are billed to come
to a heading between the contending
candidates and factions backing them
in some of the wards the fight will be
come so bitter that it will be very
hard to tell just which way the old
political cat will jump until after the
polls close on primary day and in some
instances aldermen with good records
behind them in the city council will be
flattened out and others will be re
warded with the aldermanic crown who
in the long rua will prove themselves
unworthy to wear it.
No. 20
'i-Hu-.M
B---
Alderman Joseph Higgins Smith,
will be forced to run up against a
pretty stiif opponent in the person of
J. Edward Claney, in Fourteenth Ward
but as Alderman Smith has made good
in the past and is O. K. at every stage
of the game he will be returned to the
city council from that ward.
The first of this coming week a real
live - White Bepublican candidate will
be rushed into the field in the Second
Ward and c desperate effort will be
made to unhorse Alderman Hugh
Norris, but in the final round up the
indications are that Alderman Norris
will win out with both hands down
that he will come in under the wire
the victor on primary day.
Alderman Nathaniel A. Stern and
Frederick W. Patterson will hit the
trail real hard and engage in a hand
to hand fight in the Third Ward and
for some time to come it will be
mighty hard to tell just how the scrape
will come to a heading between them
as Mr. Patterson will be strongly backed
by Mayor William H. Thompson and
his city hall crowd of Bhouters and re
tainers. Alderman Willis O. Nance, will be
forced to fight much harder than a
first class tin soldier in order to con
tinue to hold on to his present seat
in the city council and he and Aaron
J. Jones will clutch each other right
square around the neck in their hand to
hand struggle in the Sixth Ward and
they will cause the tax to fly in every
direction between now and primary
day.
Alderman Jbhn N. Kimball and Fred
erick W. Krengel will engage in an old
time knocking down and dragging out
