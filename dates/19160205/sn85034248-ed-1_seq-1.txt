Marion, in a lit of desperation, to
show a magvilic'ent tiara of precious

The clever t lat egyv sugtest ed by

Marion is distracted. One night
Morris sees Madame 1)'Orville wear

torney the next day. To prevent
Morris finding out her deception,
Marion drugs and robs him of the
fraudulent box.
Captain Dorian March, an officer of
the United States Army and sweet
heart of Gwen's, comes to the rescue,
While the police are pursuing Mar
ion, Dorian, although he has no
knowledge of what it contains, takes
the box and the suspicion with him.
After eluding the police by jumping
into the river, Dorian enlists as a
private soldier in a Canadian regi
( ent. The troopship on which he
leaves for the front is torpedoed and
sinks with all on board.
Gwen is being forced into a mar
riage with Ferrers, who threatens to
expose her sister. She believes
Dorian is drowned. The situation is
saved by Dorian, who is rescued by a
tramp steamer and returns in the
nick of time. Also Madame D'Or
ville learns the true state of affairs,
and returns her tiara to the pawn
bhioker as if from a repentant crook.
She is aided in this by a faithful
friend of Dorian's and sweetheart of
her own, called Hogg, who, in Mar
ion's name, redeems the tiara from
Morris.
Ferrers' attempt to force Gwen
into immediate mariage, to save Mar
ion from the police, is frustrated by
Dorian's arrival and the coming of
the detective, who tells of the restora
tion of the tiara to Morris.
Dorian is cleared, Marion's honor is
saved and Gwen and Dorian are
united.

SAFE FARMING FOR SOUTH.
Q Diversification Always More Profita
ble Than One-Crop System.
With characteristic forcefulness
1 and ter.eness, Hon. Bradford Knapp,
head of the United States farm de
monstration work, in an address to
Sbnkers, business men and farmers
of the south, covers the diversifica
tion situation as follows:
"W\Vith the price of cotton going up,
- are you, Mr. Banker, Mr. Business
- Man and Mr. Farmer, going back to
I the old way? The history of the ag
riculture of the south has been a his
tory of lean years and fat years. The
1 farmer has lived in distress because
short crops and high prices are al
most invariably followed by big crops
and low prices. Ii we would produce
our own living it would steady the
whole system and keep the boat from
,'ocking. The entire agriculture of
the cotton belt has been a gamble.
it has not produced a rich and pros
perous farming people because of its
uncertainty, although cotton is one
of the greatest cash crops.
"With the rise in the price of cot
ton, are you going to play safe or
are you going to take a chance? Now
is the time to decide. If you gam
ble on the price of cotton you take a
chance; if you follow the program
outlined by all the agricultural forces
last fall, you will take no chance.
Here is the program in a nutshell,
the title of which is Safe Farming:
"First. Produce a home garden for
every family on the farm-produce
Irish or sweet potatoes and where
cver' possible have a patch of sorghum
or cane to produce syrup for the fam
ily.
'Second, Produce the corn nec.
essary to support all the people on
the farm and the live stock.
"Third.. Produce the necessary
oauts and small grain to supplement
the corn as feed. Pay attention to
winter grazing of animals.
"Fourth. Produce hay and forage,
so legumnes.
"Fifth. Produce the meat neces
Sary to supply the people, through in,
creased attention to hogs and poultry
especially,
"Sixth. After all these things have
.ueen i.mply provided for in the crop
system, produce cotton for the mar
"if this course is pursued the farm
er will prosper whether cotton is fif
teei cents or six cents. If cotton is
six cents the farmer will be able to
live; if it is fifteen cents there will
be more profit in his cotton crop in
the long run, than there would be if
he neglected the living.
"Mr. Business Man and Mr. Farm
er, do you want the south to prosper
permanently? If so, lend your in
fluence to this great problem of safe
farming. A campaign will be carried
on in the various -states during the
winter and spriniig.et'ering around
the various lines :of this program.
Lend us your aid and assistance in
this campaign as you did last year. i
Not 'Safety First,' but 'Safe Farming
Always!' "
Added to the advantages enumer
ated by Mr. Knapp in favor of less i
cotton and more of other things, it E
has been observed that a small cotton <
crop usually brings more money to
the grower than a large crop; in t
other words, that the more cotton he"
grows the less money he receives for 1
it. I
ORATORICAL TREAT PROMISED.
Noted Lecturer to Speak Here Tomor
row in Cause of Common Good.
Arrangements have been com
pleted for the free public lecture on
"What's Wrong with the World" to
be delivered at the local courthouse
tomorrow night by Peter Collins, of
Massachusetts, under the auspices of
Ascension Council No. 1087, Knights
of Columbus.
Mr. Collins' lecture is one of a
series in the nation-wide educational
program of the supreme council of
the Knights of Columbus, and the
message of the lecturer is one in the
cause of God and country, of civic
righteousness and the general welfare.
It is a clear and logical treatment of
great problems confronting not only
the people of America, but vital to
civilization and its advancement. It
is entirely free from bitterness and
makes for a better understanding and
a kindlier feeling between every ele
ment in a community.
The work that Mr. Collins has been
doing for the common good by his
lectures throughout the country has
earned the approval of clergymen of
all denominations, sociologists, pro
fessors, workingmen and statesmen,
and its service for justice, good will
among men, civic progress and social
welfare can hardly be overestimated.
The general public is cordially in
vited to attend this lecture, which
will begin at 8 o'clock.
If you buy out of town, and we

bors buy out of town, what in thun
der will become of our town?

II I
PNEUMONIA.
Factors Entering Into Contraction anc
Spread of Disease.
Ten per cent of the deaths in th,
t nited States result from pneumonia
it is estimated that during the pasi
thirty days this rate has been doublec
in some sections. Tuberculosis ant
hfeart disease, each causing one-nintl
of all fatalities, are the only disease:
which outrank pneumonia among the
legion of the causes of death, but ir
certain cities pneumonia is steadily
increasing and even has surpassed
the mortality from tuberculosis.
Seventy per cent of all cases occui
between December and May. It is
distinctly a cold weather infection,
seemingly brought by wintry blasts,
but especially prevalent during the
winter season only because its. vic
Lims are rendered more susceptible at
that time by exposure, debilitating in
iluences and the presence of predis
posing infections.
Pneumonia principally affects those
at the extremes of life, but no age is
exempt. It is invariably a germ dis
ease. The predisposing and exciting
organisms are so numerous that it
would be futile to attempt their enu
meration. Many of them are con
stantly present in the mouths and
throats of healthy persons, and it is
only through the aid which we un
wittingly extend to them that they
are transformed from harmless or
ganisms toone of man's most power
ful enemies.
The presence of other diseases is
the great predisposing cause of
pneumonia, They prepare the soil
for invasion. Holding first rank in
this category is influenza, the in
creased incidence of pneumonia at
this time being largely due to the
present epidemic of la grippe. In
(livid(uals suffering from this infec
tion are peculiarly susceptible to res
piratory complications and should
properly observe every hygienic rule,
Inflammation of the upper air pas
sages, pharyngitis, bronchitis, and
tonsiiitis often predispose to the de
velopment of the disease, particular
ly among the aged and infirm. The
acute contagious diseases of chi.
hood, more especially measles anic
woiooping cough, frequently prepare
the way for pneumonia, Anyone who
through neglect or carelessness par
m.ts the spread of these infections is
therefore open to the severest con
demnation. Exhausting disease of
whatever nature is often sufficient to
o.o reduce our resistance that we are
unable to cope with organisms which
should be easily overcome, and hence
predisposes to the infection.
Debility, either temporary or
chronic, developing from any cause,
increases susceptibility. Because of
this the disease most often attacks
those at the e tras .ofifr.l:. Ammopg
debilitating influences must be men
tioned cold, exposure to penetrating
winds, and the chilling of body sur
faces as a result of wetting.
The combination of lack of food
and fatigue proves particularly dis
astrous during the winter season and
is a condition to be avoided when
ever possible. Bad housing, mental
or physical harassment, and over
work are alike the advance agents of
the infection. Overcrowding, in
street cars, theatres, and other pub
lic places, is unquestionably in part
responsible for the spread of pneu
monia in cities, as far greater op
portunity is thus offered for the di>
semination of the predisposing dis
eases through indiscriminate cough
ing and other means of droplet in
fection, as well as the directly in
jurious effects which inevitably result
from exposure to such environment.
The overheating of -rooms is also
seemingly harmful. Promiscuous ex
pectoration may be, and probably is,
a factor in infection and consequent
ly should be avoided by every citizen.
A remaining most important agent
should be mentioned-alcohol. It is
in truth the handmaiden of pneu
monia, and there is none more cer
tain or more sure of success, especial
ly if liberally and continuously used.
While the foregoing facts constitute
in part our knowledge of the reasons
for the widespread dissemination of
an infection which carries with it a
mortality of from ten to thirty per
cent, it should be remembered that
our scientific data are not yet com
plete. There are problems connect
ed with immunity, predisposition, and
the occurrence of epidemics which are
yet to be solved. It is known that
pneumonia frequently attacks those
who are perfectly well, and who ap
parently have observed every hy
gienic rule. Whether this is due to
the increased virulence of the organ
ism or to other causes is unexplained.
It is, however, recognized that avoid
ance of the factors so briefly enu
merated will in large part diminish
individual susceptibility and there
fore the incidence of the disease.
AVOID MISTAKES.
No Need for Donaldsonville People to
Experiment with Such Convinc
ing Evidence at Hand.
There are many well-advertised
kidney remedies on the market today,
but none so well-recommended in
this vicinity as Doan's Kidney Pills.
Read the statement of a resident of
Napoleonville:
John Ross, engineer of pumping
station, Napoleonville, La., says: "I
have had some trouble from lame
back and at times my kidneys don't
act as they should. Doan's Kidney
Pills give me quick relief. I recom
mend Doan's Kidney Pills to anyone
who is in need of a kidney medicine.
They have no equal."
Price 50 cents at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy-get

VOTES FOR WOMEN.

Root Illogic.
Can anything be funnier than the
reasoning of Elihu Root? Here are
some quotations: "The whole busi
ness of government in which we are
ALL concerned is becoming serious,
grave and threatening." How does
he explain ALL as precluding womenr
And his logic in the address before
the Pan-American: Scientific Congress
is at variance with? his views in Amer
ican applied democracy. He com
pared individual 4nd national rights
by citing that hurjan beings have the
right of defense. 5And then he says:
"We deem the independence and equal
rights of the smallest and weakest
members of the family of nations en
titled to as much respect as those of
the greatest empire, and we deem the
observance of that respect the chief
guarantee of the Weak against the op
pression of the strong." Well, say,
isn't there \something inconsistent
about that last statement and a stand
in opposition to women's equal op
portunity in the protection of the
ballot?
Women Workers Increasing in
Numbers.
Practical conditions and flimsy
theories seem to be at variance in
New York. A report issued by the
intercollegiate bureau of occupations
shows that women workers are in
creasing greatly in numbers and the
demand almost exceeds the supply.
Yet New York voters just refused to
give women the ballot on the theory
that women should stay in the home,
and that men should be protectors.
Good theory, that. Nobody finds
much fault with it, but it looks to an
outsider as if New York men were
i'alling down on the protector job,
vhen the records of working women
re e:;mined. Wonder if any of the
men who voted "no" to giving women
he pi otection: of the ballot, haves
vago-earning women in their fami
ics? And, wonder No. 2, do all the
.nti-suffrage men refuse to employ
women so as to keep them at home,
or do they take advantage of .wo
men's voteless inability to demand
legislation concerning jobs?
States Rights Suffrage.
In recounting the chances of a
federal amendment. for woman suf
frage, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,
president of the National American
Suffrage Association, which is con
centrating its activities on such an
amendment, s .rep.te - t ha ve given
her opinion, "There is not the ghost
of a chance that the real southern
legislatures will ratify an amendment, I
even if submitted." Southern women
want their suffrage through the t
states rights method, and the South
ern States Woman Suffrage Confer
ence adopts this way.
Enthusiasm in South Carolina. c
South Carolina women are enthu- i
siastic over the unexpectedly large
vote the woman suffrage bill re- s
ceived in the house.' Fifty-one fa- t
vorable votes are a big showing for t
the first presentation in the legisla- i:
vre of the state. As a Columbia suf
fragist joyfully writes of the situa- v
tion: "If Miss Gordon had been with d
us to present the argument, we might d
have won. We hope we can secure n
her next year." Here's hoping, t
South Carolina! n
The scope of the San Diego Ex- d
position has been increased so great- g
ly for 1916 that the directors have k
found it necessary to change the
name to read, "Panama-California In- n
ternational Exposition." Canada, h
Russia, France, Italy, Germany, d
Austria, Brazil, the Netherlands, and a
Switzerland, are installing big dis- c
plays-the greater part of them o
brought from the San Francisco Ex- u
position. Other featutres of the a
beautiful exposition have been en- p
larged so that the dedication of the n
new exposition, March 15, is more ti
than a matter of form.

WORSE THAN A WOUND.
Ticks Bleed Cattle at Rate of 200
Pounds Yearly..
If one of your steers or dairy cows
a quart of blood a day, you'd do some
thing about it in a hurry. You'd
know that such loss of blood would
weaken the animal, prevent its put
ting on weight, and, in the case of the
cow, you'd soon see the milk flow fll
off. If you couldn't handle the wound
yourself you'd think it a good invest
ment to pay a veterinarian from 50
cents to $1, or more, to stop the bleed
ing.
Ticks have the same effect on a
steer or a cow as such a wound, but'
the difference is that you don't see
the blood dripping because it flows
into the tick. Every tick bite is a
s"c wound on the animal through
fch blood is constantly being
drawn. These tiny wounds and the
drawing of this blood irritate the ani
mal and weaken it just the same as
the wound. The wound, of course,
may become infected and make the
animal very sick, but the tick in ad
dition to causing blood to flow may
give the animal Texas fever and even
kill it.
This is not theory. Actual experi
ments show that where an animal is
heavily infested with ticks they will
draw as much as 200 pounds of blood
a year from a 1000-pound steer. Of
course they do not draw this all at
once, but get it in tiny sucks. Fig
ures show that the blood in a steer
at any one time weighs about 50
pounds. Where the ticks are very
numerous and very busy, therefore,
they force the animal to renew its
blood four times a year. This means
that blood that should go to make
milk or meat goes into fattening
ticks. An actual experiment showed
that a tick-infested steer which
weighed only 730 pounds and was a
scrawny animal, when freed from
ticks by being dipped in the arsenical

DECLARES FOR PARKER.
Jeanerette Coast-Herald Sponsors In
dependent Democratic Move.
The Jearnette 2Coast-Ierald, one
cratic newspapers of the third dis
trict, in its issue of last Saturday de
clared for John M.' Parker for gov
ernor in an editorial denouncing the
New Orleans ward bosses. The pa
per's remarks were as follows:
"The Coast-Herald will not sup
port the nominees of a crooked elec
tion. The New Orleans returns in
the primary election bear prima facie
evidence of wholesale frauds and the
Coast-Herald refuses to-be bound by
the results of a crooked election.
"The city ring has done its work
too strong and imposes too much on
the credulity of the people to ask
them to believe that in a city of over U.
400,000 souls, Mr. Barret with the in
fluences at workfor him polled only
3700 votes. The city ring, although
it had widened its organization so
that it was allied with most every
courthouse in the state, was in doubt
of the country vote, and it is evident
it counted the city majority for its
candidate strong enough to cover any
contingency.
"The Democracy of Louisiana needs a
to purge itself of the contamination
of the unspeakable city ring. If its
slimy tentacles have reached so far
that the octopus cannot be strangled
within the organization, then it be
hooves those Democrats who believe
in honest elections and the principal
of the highest citizenship controlling
the destinies of the state to repudiate
the organization at all costs and all
hazards.
"When men of the character, abil
ity and attainments of Thomas C.
Barret, Clarence Pierson, John Over
ton, Porteus Burke and Austin Fon
Lenot have to go to the ward bosses
)f the city of New Orleans with hat in
iand and ask for their sanction be
Fore they can present their claims to
the people for office with a hope of
success, the body politic is sick
enough to demand a drastic remedy.
"The Herald holds few ideas in
common with Mr. John M. Parker,
but we believe the welfare of the
state will be better served to have
Mr. Parker elected governor of Lou
isiana on an honest ballot than Col.
Pleasant elevated to the position by
corrupt practices of ring politicians.
In taking this stand we do not abate
one jot or title of our Democracy.
We believe that the principles of
Democracy are essential to a republi
can form of government. We be
lieve the Democratic party is the only
medium through which the people of
this republic can protect themselves
from the aggressions and oppressions
of the trusts and organized specula
tive wealth. It is the party of the
great middle class-the bulwark of
liberty in every free country--of the
farmer, the professional and the busi
mess man, who bear the burden of
taxation and ioulder the guns when
the country needs soldiers. But when
the organization falls into the hands
of corrupt politicians we believe it
is the duty of the rank and file to res
cue the party from their machina
tions and restore it to its proper
functions. Such a case confronts us
in Louisiana today. How many have
the courage to defy the party lash
which is now wielded by ruthless and
unworthy hands?"
