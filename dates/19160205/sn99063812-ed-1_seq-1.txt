A
,'inlgc Ilcrnard Daly of Lake coun-j
ty, tins filed his oplrjlon' In the appeal
r-.l the Merrill necord from the deci
sion of tho county court In awarding
tho irintlng contrncl for 191G to tho
livening Herald.
The citHH was submitted to tho 1-ukc"
ro,inty court on stipulation for a deel-,
slon of the main contention of the two
parties to tho suit. Judge Daly ren-
dors bin opinion on the polntx in-
volvod, but does not enter a decree on
the findings of fact, anil It In probable;
that the case will have to go back or J
a request made of the Judge for a,
court order either sustaining or dls-j
mlKsing the appeal. .
The main contention of the Herald ,
that tho county court had the right to I
make an Investigation for themselves!
as to the validity of the subscription
lUts wan upheld by Judge Daly, and
Inasmuch as he did not find that the
county court bad erred, the natural
conclusion would bo that tho appeal
Hhould be dismissed. On this point
the court says:
"Answering question IV, the court
U of the opinion that evidence outside
the lists submitted by rival newspa
pers may be considered In determin
ing tho paper of largest circulation,
,..-.- or fraud aro duly made,
" ulc iover...u MWi.uu . .
clal county newspnpers appears in me
last threo sections ot the act appear
ing at page HO, General Laws of Ore
gon for 1S91. The law plainly con
templates a selection baaed upon the
facts of the lists submitted, when
such lists are conceded to be fair.
However, when charges of fraud are
placed against the submitted lists,
the stntuto says, 'the court shall seek
other evidence of circulation.' The
gathering ot ovidence Is not limited
to tho lists tiled, but the truth is to
be ascertained from any competent,
legal evidence within reach of the
court nnd tho interested parties. Any
othor conclusion would necessitate a
Judicial addition to the plain lan
guage ot the statutes."
One of the stipulated questions sub
mitted was as to whether subscribers
receiving their papers by carrier In
stead of through the postofflce, were
bona lido subscribers, and to be con
sidered in determining the circula
tion. Judge Daly's opinion on this
question is to the effect that "the HatB
of subscribers should be
confined to bona fide subscribers who
havo ordorod tho paper for nt least
one year, nnd who receive the paper
through tho United Statoa postofflce
It this opinion was sustained by the
supromo court it would affect more
ihun halt of tho loading newspapers
of tho state, as practically oill modern
nowspaporo, both dally and weekly,
sivn their subscribers the service de
manded by this age of progresslveness

and business houses, Instead of forc
ing all the people to travel to the poet
office before they can hare an oppor
tunity of reading the newa, Thla In
terpretation of the law has never been
recognised by county court hereto

BUT ONE ARREST
FIFTV-SKVKX AIHtKSTS WERE
MADE IX SEITEMBER, AXD
ONLY TWO DURING JANUARY,
ACCORDING TO THE RECORDS
During the first month of "Dry Ore
gon'' there were but two arrests by
tho local police. Of these, one man
was charged with drunkenness. The
arests for a few months before that
time follew:
September Arrests 57, for drunk
enness, 48.
October Arests 43; for drunken
ness, 41.
November Arrests 26; for drunk
enness, 17.
December Arests 17; for drunk
enness, 16.
The gradual falling oft in arrests
for drunkenness, etc., is generally
taken to be the result of the shutting
down ot work In the mills and woods,
and to tho departure ot men for other
sections during the winter months.
