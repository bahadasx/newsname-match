HERE'S A CASE FOR
THE L0CAL BOOSTERS
Power Coinpnny Should Ilulld to the
Mines From Canyon Plants Rnlher
Thau From Snnko Creek Plant.
A representative of tho Utah Power
and Light company went on snow
shoes this weelc over tho proposed
routo from Snnko creek to tho lo.
cation where tho Pacific mine will
erect Its mill, to lnvcstlgnto tho fens
ablllty of getting power into tho enmp
from this source. It was a most dif
ficult trip and illustrated tho hnzaid
ous task that 11 troublo shooter
would havo In caso ho had to patrol
such a lino In tho winter.
Right now Ib tho tlmo for tho lo
cnl boosters to send a commlttco to
tho Powor people and show them the
deslinbllity of tnklng tho power up the
ennyon from tho American Foik can
yon plants, Instead of from tho Provo
vnlley side. If taken from this way
It would Insure tho nil year operation
of tho locnl plant and would prob
ably mean tho saving of $7,000 por
yenr In snlarlcs for this district.
It should bo pointed but to tho com
pnny thnt whllo tho Snnko creek lino
to tho Pacific might bo a littlo short
ar, thcro nro many other properties
that will need power fnrthor down
this way. It has been suggested by
a man well posted In tho canyon thnt
tho most desirable locution for the
substation would bo on Jackson's tint,
from which point linos would bo run
up Major Evans' gulch to. tho Enrl
Eagle, up tho Mary Ellon gulch to
tho Mary Ellen, Bolorophnn and on
up to tho Mlnoral Flat, as well as
going up tho Main ennyon to tho
Pacific, Whirlwind, Texan nnd Bny
Stnto. Then thcro nro tho Wasatch
King and other Door Creek properties,
all of which want electric onorgy to
opornto power dillls, and which
could bo hotter served from n lino
going up tho canyon.
Anothor argument Is that coming
ovor from Snnko creek, nearly nil
tho holes for sotting tho poles would
hnvo to bo blristrl In tho solid rock,
hllo thoy could Lo dug If tho low
er routo wnB chosen Bosldes this
tho poles could bo distributed ovor
tho lntter route moro cheaply than
ovor tho other ono. '

Tho oro will bring about $C0 per ton.
Tho Dutchman mine Is ono of tho

of tho tram nt least 60 cents a ton

MORE ACTIVITY THAN

Tho -forecast now Is that thoro will
bo moro activity in mining In tho noxt
six months, both Jn tho mines and on

for threo years past. It used to ha
an old saying that pcoplo could not
look much Into tho ground, beyond tho
ond of tho drill and pick, and tho drill
and tho pick havo boon doing fine work
for somo months now. A great many
now oro bodies havo been uncovered

If thoy can got what !b equivalent to

without taking It out of other men's
pockets; nnd tho other fact is apparent
to them thnt whllo It was n habit of

Is a risky buslnoss, it is all the samo
