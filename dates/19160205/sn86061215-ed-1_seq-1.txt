SHIP'S SUING
"ILLEGAL" ACT
One Word Is the Stumbling
Block to Settlement of
1 Lusitania Case
BERLIN ADMITS
CRISIS IS AT HAND
Kaiser Seeks to Avoid the
Humiliation Demanded
By United States
On Board President Wilson's
8pecial train, Harrisburg, Pa..
Feb. 4.—President Wilson was on
his way to Washington today to
take up with Secretary Lansing
consideration of the Lusitania and
Appam cases.
After six days spent in the mid*
die west in urging stronger na
tionai defenses and describing the
grave possibilities of the interna
tional situation, he was returning
to decide international questions
of great Importance.
The president was due to arrive
In Washington at 1 p. m. He slept
until a late hour today to recover
from the effects of hjs strenuous
trip.
Berlin, Feb. 4.—Information reach
ing The Associated Press today indi
cates that under no circumstances will
Germany admit the sinking of the
Lusitania was an Illegal act.
The new Instruction*- forwarded to
Ambassador von Bernstorff, according
to this information, contain simply one
Sroposed
hrase of the new formulation of the
note of regret for the sink
ing of the Lusitania. The suggested
sentence is short, consisting of only
(sight words and does not contain the
word "Illegal." It represents the ex
treme limit of Germany's concessions
In the Lusitania case.
The riew is entertained here that
one of the most serious crises of the
War has arisen In connection with the
Lusitania case, and that it is impos
sible to foresee the outcome from any
Indications here. The result of the
negotiations appears to hinge solely on
the one word "Illegal."
In the way of an agreement between
the United States and Germany stand
only these seven letters, expressing
the conception yrhlch President Wil
son and Secretary Lansing Insist must
be embodied in the German formula
expressing regret for the loss of Amer
ican lives aboard the Cunarder.
The Associated Press Is Informed
positively and authoritatively that
Germany cannot and will not desig
nate as illegal the sinking of a liner
by any submarine.
No Other Bare.
Virtually no other difficulties tn the
way of settlement remain, and the
Hew instructions forwarded to Ambas
sador von Bernstorff on Tuesday con
tain merely the new formula by which
It is hoped to satisfy Washington with
out humiliating this country.
Although the suggested sentence,
according to a reliable version, con
sists of only eight words and does npt
contain the word 'Illegal" or charac
terize the sinking of the Lusitania as
E
h, it goes otherwise to the furthest
ent possible toward meeting Ameri
can desires.
WIH Fight W Need Be.
The Krenx Zeltupg interprets Presi
dent Wilson's present warlike course,
as dictated to some extent by political
considerations. It says both the
American and European press have re
garded the president's attitude
throughout the war as being influenced
&o one considered such an lnterpreta
tlon of his utterances as especially un
friendly to him, regarding it as a thing
to be expected. Assuming a more
seriouB tone, the paper adds:
"At the moment it seems best to
emphasize the point on which the Ger
man people are most completely
agreed namely, that nobody, of course
would regard a conflict with the United
States as a slight matter, but that we
are all resolved nevertheless to take
on us this new enmity if it can not
be avoided without sacrificing our
Self-respect and dignity, without lay
ing on ourselves fetters that hinder
our freedom of movement in the strug
gle for our existence."
The Vossische Zeitung and the
Tageblatt hold that the announcement
In regard to the latest instructions
sent to Ambassador von Bernstorff are
S'heso
ot sweeping as generally supposed,
Tageblatt says the language used
Was vdry reserved and-could not war
rant any hasty or, far reaching con
clusions.

trustworthy source information that
the Turks have evacuated Erzerum, to
which a large Turkish force was re
cently driven after a defeat by the
Russians.
Erzerum has been considered one of
the main Turkish strongholds on the
Caucasus front. A relief force sent
thence from Treblzond on the Black
sea coast was recently repented in re

Russians. Today's statement from
Constantinople does not mention the
Caucasus operations except as they
are included in the general statement
that no events of Importance have oc
curred.

London, Feb. 4. Artillery lighting
continues along the western front,
especially near Loos, which the Brit

The collier Franz Fischer was sunk
in the North sea by a bomb from a
Zeppelin returning from a raid on Eng

FIRE OF MYSTERIOUS ORIGIN
DOE8 CONSIDERABLE HARM
TO FINE STRUCTURE.
Ottawa, Ont., Feb. 4.—Two women
and. three men are known to have per
ished in the fire which swept the cen
tral portion of Canada's magnificent
parliament building last night, des
troying the chambers of commons and
senate. Several others are reported
mising and it is feared today they are
burled in the ruins.
All night long firemen, police and
soldiers fought to save the 16,000,000
structure, which is considered one of
the finest examples of Gothic archi
tecture on this continent. They were
successful in saving the library build
ing and the east and ^est wings of
the main edifice.
Immediately after the fire started a
report was spread that it was caused
by the explosion of an incendiary
bomb. The fire started in the reading
room of the house of commons, and
several persons who were present at
the time, 'including Mayor Martin of
Montreal, asserted that it was pre
ceded by an explosion which knocked
down several persons. The bomb
theory was, however, rejected today
dominion police, who insisted that the
conflagration was accidental.
The two women who lost their lives
were Mme. Bray, wife of H. A. Bray
of Quebec, and Mme. Morin, wife of
Louis Morin of Beauce, Quebec. The
men, whose bodies are buried in the
debris, are a policeman, an employe
In the building and a waiter.
Among those reported missing is B.
B. Law, a member of parliament for
Yarmouth, N. S. Mr. Law is under
stood to have been at the house at the
time the fire broke out and has not
been seen since. J. B. Laplant, assist
ant clerk of the commons, is also
among those reported missing.

The police court was idle again this
morning, not one offender being in

SHIP DISASTER
Red Cross Nurse From U. S.
Describes Sinking of
Steamer Brindisi
MONTENEGRO MEN
SLAY EACH OTHER
Refuse to Die By the Hand
of the Enemy Sees Serbs
Starving to Death
Athens, Feb. 4.—"There is not any
way to tell you so that you would un
derstand the awful horror of the
things that I have Been in the last
month," said Marie Lemos of Chicago,
one of the Red Cross nurses who sur
vived the sinking of the Italian steam
ship Brindisi, which recently struck a
mine in the Adriatic. She continued:
"The hideous rapidity of the sinking
of the steamship Brindisi with her
decks covered with dead myself shot
into the water, which was full of
struggling youths trying to keep afloat
but disappearing one by one within
sight of land the Austrian aeroplane
attacks on San Giovanni di Medua and
Duraim the sight of hundreds of
Serbs failing exhausted and dying
from hunger and cold along the road
of their retreat through Albania—it
does not seem believable."
Miss Lemos is 22 years old, with
broad features, revealing her Bohem
ian extraction. High laced boots, a
khaki blouse, a jacket embroidered
with the Red Cross insignia and a flan
nel waist constitute her only posses
sions.
Montenegrins Kill Selves.
"We struck a mine at 9:30 o'clock
in the morning and the ship began to
sink Immediately," said Miss. Lemos.
"We tried to lower a boat but the ship
keeled over so that everybody was
thrown Into the water. Miss Hample
could not swim and never came up.
I scrambled back aboard the Brandisl
where I found some 200 Montenegrins
who were unable to Swim.
"These men said they would not die
by the enemy's hand.. The sang their
national anthem and then one. squad
shot the others -and finally killed
themselves. The decks were covered
with dead and-awash with blood.
"When the ship began to founder I
slipped back into the water and swam
to a plank on which several men were
clinging but who dropped off one by
one.
"Finally, after being three hours In
the water, I was picked up and taken
to San Giovanni di Medua.
Attacked by Alrriten.
"As soon as the 14S persons rescued
were safely ashore, the Montenegrins
lined up and resang the national an
them. While the men were singing,
an Austrian aeroplane squadron bom
barded the town, killing eighteen of
those who had just been saved.
"From San Giovanni di Meftlua we
walked to Scutari and sought to join
the Serbian staff at Plavnica but six
days later the evacuation of the town
took place.
"King Nicholas of Montenegro
brought us to Scutari in his boat He
is a kindly old man who seems to un
derstand, but Prince Peter says he
wants to give up the struggle and
again begin life as a private citizen,
preferably in America.
"From Scutari'we walked five days
through sleet and snow over detest
able roads, along which the hunger
weakened Serbs died like flies.
"Reaching Durazzo, seven pursuing
Austrian aeroplanes bombarded the
town where the remnants of the Ser
bian army were so crowded that they
were unable to escape the missiles.
Many were killed and others wound
ed, and owing' to the lack of medical
stores, the suffering was frightful."

ALL BRITONS ON
STEAMER APPAM
GIVEN LIBERTY
UNITED STATES DECIDES THAT
PRUSSIA N-AMSRICAN TREATY
RULES IN CASE.
Washington, D. C, Feb. 4.—Sir
Cecil Sprlntf-Rice, the British am
bassador, today presented a form
al demand on behalf of Ms govern
ment, for the return to British
owners of the liner Appam, taken
by a German prise crew. A new
diplomatic controversy with Great
Britain is foreshadowed as the
United States practically has de
elded to hold the prize as Ger
many's.
Washington, D. C., Feb. 4.—Secre
tary Lansing indicated today that the
United States had decided to hold
that the Prussian-American treaty
governs the case of the Appam, as
Germany contends, and that all that
remained to be decided was the inter
pretation of the application of the
treaty's terms.
The secretary disclosed further that
the sole question to be decided by the
interpretation was how long the Ap
pam should be permitted to remain
in American waters.
The treaty guarantees to a German
prise the right to come and go freely.
If the Appan) were forced to depart
she would doubtless become the prey
of British cruisers outside the Vir
ginia capes. If forced to depart, Ger
man officials have stated the ship
would be sunk to prevent her capture
by the British.
Germany is expected to contend
that the treaty guarantees the Appam
the right to remain safe In Hampton
roads until the case goes before a
prise court for adjudication. Techni
cally the ship does not become Ger
many's prise until such a court estab
lishes the vaHdlty of her capture.
BRITONS ARE RELEASED.
Newport News, Va., Feb. 4.—Only
Lieut. Berg and his small prise crew
remain today aboard the former Brit
ish passenger steamer Appam, brought
Into these neutral waters last Tues
day as a prise of war. The liner's
passengers and original ship's
com­!
pany, taken prisoners when the ship
was captured by a mysterious German
raider off the Canary Islands January
15, were liberated last night by order
of the United States government
The passengers today are aboard
the Old Dominion liner Jefferson, en
route to New York, where they were
expected to arrive tonight. The mem
bers of the crew, with the gun point
ers taken from other British steamers
which the raider sank before the Ap
pam was overhauled, are in Norfolk
awaiting the sailing of another New
Tork steamer tonight.
The Appam is to remain at this port
until the Washington government de
cides what disposition of her shall be
made—whether she shall be held a
fair prize of her German captors un
der the Prussian-American treaty or
returned to her British owners under
The Hague convention.

Seattle, Wash., Feb. 4. The novel
ty of a two foot fall of snow having
worn off, the people of western Wash
ington today are reestablishing normal
business conditions while the railroads
tried to clear their mountain tracks for
overland travel.
The greatest danger confronting the
railroads is a sudden thaw which It Is
'believed would start disastrous ava
lanches down the mountain slopes and
release torrents of water In the val
leys.
Damage caused in Oregon by the
storm was estimated at more than
$500,000.

Clarinda, Feb. 4.—Sheriff Whitmore
and a posse of armed citizens are
searching the country about Sham
baugh for eight robbers who early this
morning made an unsuccessful at
tempt to rob the State Savings bank
at Shambaugh.
The robbers kept the citizens of
Shambaugh in terror from 2:10 o'clock
when the first of a series of explosions
was heard until 8:30 a. m. None of the
explosions opened the big safe, how
ever, and $3,000 in cash and large
sums In checks and drafts were un
touched.
The first explosion awoke nearby
residents, who telephoned to Clarinda
for help. Sheriff Whitmore broke into
a hardware store, obtained rifles and
revolvers and with a hastily organised
posse, hastened to Shambaugh in auto
mobiles.
The bandits saw the light of the ap
proaching machines and made their
escape in a waiting automobile. Just
after residents had telephoned to Clar
inda tor help the telephone wire was
cut by the robbers. Seyeral citizens
who left their homes to investigate the
explosions were met by the robbers
and ordered back to bed at the point
of revolvers.
All towns In Page county have been
notified and the authorities and armed
citizens are on the lookout for the
bandits. The robbers, however, are be
lieved to have gone south and may
have escaped into Missouri or Ne
braska.
Later reports from Shambaugh said
that the entire front of the bank and
one side of the building were blown
out and the inBide badly damaged. It
was said the robbers used an exceed
ingly heavy charge of explosives after
the first few discharges had failed to
open the safe. Shambaugh is seven
