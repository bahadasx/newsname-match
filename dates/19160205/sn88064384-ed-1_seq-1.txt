an buy the kind of coa that will
kef-p you cool with the fewest
trips to the cellar. Try our coal
this year. You'll find it goes so
much farther than ordinray fuel
that when warm weather comes
around you'll have a nice little
pile left to start the next season
on. That proves it's coal conomy
to buy here.

Effective March 1, the price of tlie Chalmers Six-40 will be
$1450 f. o. b. Detroit. This is an increase of $100 over
the present price. It is made necessary by the sharp rise
in cost of raw materials.
Aluminum which sold for 10 cents a pound o.ily a few
months ago now brings 53 cents.
Copper has risen from 14 cents to 2 1 cents.
Vanadium Steel a year ago brought $1.85 a pound.
Now it sells for $8.50.
High-Speed Steel formerly at a $1.05 abound now is
worth $3.35.
Leather formerly 20 cents afoot now brings 33 cent:.
And so on.
All told, it costs $118.22 m nv in raw material to build
the Six-40 than it did some months ag<>. As this amount
is considerably in excess of our net profit per car. only two
courses were open to us.
One was to raise tlie price.
The other was to lowsr the quality.
To follow the latter course meant a "one yen" car.
This kind of an automobile Chalmers has never built and
never will build.
Therefore, a rise in price was the only procedure pos
sible.
We regret that an increase in price is necessary, but we
feel that other manufacturers of automobiles will be forced
cither to increase the price or use a lower grade of materials.
For it is not possible to buy superior products in the
open market at any less price than Chalmers pays.
We think it only fair to those who have planned to pur
chase the Six-40, and have been qu >ted the $1350 price, to
take this opportunity of saying that we will accept orders
at that price up to midnight February 29. Thereafter the
price of $1450 f. o. b. Detroit will prevail
