NOTES NO CHANGE
MANIA CASE
State Department Does Not
Admit Increased Gravity
in the Situation.
CONFERENCE TO BE HELD
WITH PRESIDENT WILSON
New Tentative Agreement Submitted
by German Ambassador Will
Be Considered Carefully.
President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing will not begin discussion
oi Germany's latest answer in the
I.usitania negotiations before
Monday.
It was said that the President
already has the proposal from
' Berlin before hint and wants to
go over it carefully before he begins
conferences with the Secre
tarv of State. It was pointed out
tliat the situation was not one
which called for haste.
Offiicals in touch with the negotiations
reiterated their statement that
the situation was unchanged. There
was an undertone of expectation that
the two governments would be able
to find common ground for agreement
in official declarations that Berlin's reply
had not made the situation any
more serious. /
It was said in high official quarters
that some announcement might be
made within the next few days.
Ambassador Beady for Conference.
Count von Bernstorff had no appointment
today to confer with Secretary
Dansing. but was holding himself in
readiness to go to the State Department
whenever his presence might be
required.
Administration officials carefully refrained
from expressing any opinion
on the acceptability or n on-acceptability
of the newest proposal. They
that it cnuld not be said
there was a deadlock, because negotiations
still were under way.
Apparently a Stumbling- Block.
Apparently the stumbling block of the
situation is the word "illegal" as differently
interpreted in this country
and Germany. The Berlin government's
answer proposes, instead of a
flat admission of illegality of the
method of submarine warfare In sinking
the liner, an acceptance of liability
for the loss of neutral lives, which
Germany hopes will satisfy* the United
States and still not prevent Germany
from continuing the submarine campaign.
German officials believe that their
previous promise to discontinue sinking
unresisting merchantmen without
warning brings the submarine campaign
within the pale of international
law. and that any inclusion of that
phase in the I.usitania agreement is
unnecessary and humiliating to the
Imperial government.
Germany's Interpretation.
The word "illegal" in the draft the
German ambassador transmitted to his
government as meeting all the contentions
of the United States, is taken to have
been regarded in Berlin as being susceptible
of application not to the l.usitania
case alone, but to the entire submarine
campaign.
The American government in a recent '
communication to all the belligerents I
openly recognized the submarine as the
factor which has brought about a great i
change ir, naval warfare, and which demands
recognition in international law.
Point Emphasized.
< me point which was emphasized toV
day. and which bears on the time which
must elapse before President Wilson
and Secretary Lansing come to a de?
ion. is that any change of whatever
character in a diplomatic document of
such far-reaching importance, not only
t<< the coming developments of the Eu- |
ropean war. but which may possibly
'.ine time in the future affect the naval
operations of the United States, must j
b?- subjected to the most thorough and!
painstaking analysis with a full con-!
sideratior. of its consequences.
Lansing Proposal Not Received.
BKKLIN, February 5, via London, Feb- j
ruary ?There are no new develop- |
merits here today in the Lusitania case,
while news Is being awaited from
Washington. With regard to the proposals
of Secretary Lansing on the subject
of submarine warfare and the arm
. . *, vi naiiuiirn. I ii v iinowiaieu
I'r?ss is authoritatively informed that
they have not so far been submitted to
Germany.
The Koelnis* he Yolks Zeitung. an organ
of the Catholic party, says that
The proposals as gi\y?n in the cabled
reports are absolutely inacceptable. a*
their acceptance would signify the
abandonment of the entire German submarine
campaign against the commerce
of the allies.
With regard to the Lusitania question.
the Volks Zeitung says that If Mr.
Wilson is correctly reported as demanding
that Germany recognize that
the ^inking of the Lusitama was illegal
and Unjustified by the theory of reprisals.
then there can be only one answer?h.
flat refusal.
The tension created by the latest developments
in the I^usitania case evidently
is lessening. Most of the afternoon
papers do not discuss the situation
today.
HOLLAND IS DEMANDING
GERMAN REPARATION
TDK HAGUE. Netherlands, February
t.?Hutch newspapers, both pro-Gerjpau
and anti-German, are unanimous
in demanding; from Germany prompt
explanation of and reparation for the
4orpedolfii? of the Dutch tank steamer
Artemis by a German torpedo boat in
the North sea. The newspapers call for
punishment of the German commander
who was responsible for what is described
as a violation of law and an
unjustifiable act of war against the
Netherlands.

WILLING TO LISTEN
TO DRUGGISTS' PLEA
Senator Sheppard Carefully
Considers Objections to District
Prohibition Bill.
MAY OFFER AMENDMENT
IF ARGUMENTS JUSTIFY
Protest Made Against Clause in
Measure wmcn .Limits aaie 01
Grain Alcohol.
Senator Sheppard of Texas, author of
the bill for prohibition in the District
of Columbia, which is now orTfbe Senate
calendar, said today that he was
looking carefully into the protests of
druggists of the District opposing
those features of his bill which would
limit the sale of grain alcohol by
wholesale and retail druggists.
If he became convinced of the justice
of the protests of the druggists, he
jsaid, he would be inclined to offer an
I amendment modifying the restrictions
now in the bill.
Sehator Works of California, a memI
her of the subcommittee of the District
committee which reported the prohibition
bill to the full committee, and
who was instrumental in having the
bill later reported to the Senate, said
ah t li o nthor kanit
"The provision of the bill which permits
the sale of grain alcohol In the
District by five wholesale druggists
permits the sale by just Ave too many.
In my opinion, grain alcohol should'not
be sold at all for medical purposes.
Many physicians have reached the conclusion
that whisky and other alcoholic
beverages are not needed now as stimulants,
for they have others much better."
Contention of the Druggists.
The particular provision of the bill
I to which the druggists are opposed
I limits the sale of grain alcohol to five
| wholesale druggists, and includes in
this limitation the sale of wood or denatured
alcohol, and also prohibits the
sale of more than five gallons to any
i one person at a time, and provides that
a permit must be obtained from the
, District Commissioners to buy- before
any sale can be m^de. The cost of this
I permit is 25 cents, and small druggists
; needing grain alcohol would be put on
the same basis as private citizens.
So far but few of the protests from
ithe druggists, of whom there are some
235. wholesale and retail, in the District.
have reached members of Congress.
Senator John Walter Smith,
chairman of the District committee, has
received five. Four of these are printed
forms and one was a . .. pewritten
letter.
Liquor Interests Arrayed.
The liquor interests of the couptry
are leaving no stone unturned to defeat
the District prohibition bill, feeling
that to have prohibition estab
lished in the capital of the nation
would be a severe blow at their industry.
Letters and telegrams are pourling
in to many of the senators and
| representatives in large numbers, particularly
from those states where
large wine, liquor and brewing interests
are located. Senator Harding ofli
Ohio already has received some 800
telegrams from persons in his state
protesting against the enactment of
the bill into law.
j On the other hand, many letters and
telegrams are being received from the
"drys" in various parts of the country.
Senator Kenyan of Iowa has heard
from a number of supporters of prohibition
in his state demanding that the
District dry bill be passed.
Now that the Philippine bill is out of
the way in the Senate, there remains
only the water power bill to be disposed
of before Senator Sheppard moves
to take up the District prohibition bill,
if he carries out the notice which he
gave in the Senate at the time that
measure was reported to that body.*
Program May Be Blocked.
It is possible, however, that some of
jthe appropriation bills may reach the
I Senate in time to block this program,
particularly as the water power bill is
sure to give rise to a long debate in the
I Senate.
I As was reported in The Star before
the Sheppard bill was brought into the
Senate by the District committee and
placed on the calendar, the opponents
of prohibition are basing large hopes
on the adoption of an amendment providing
for a referendum of the liquor
question to the people of the District.
Some senator* who will vote for the bill
have said that they will also be Inclined
to support a referendum amendment.
believing in local option. Many
prohibitionists, however, are op{josed to
the adoption of such an amendment,
and will do their best to defeat it.
GETS VERDICT FOR $20,000.
j Michael Killilea Awarded Damages
by Jury From J. P. Morgan.
MINEOLA, E. I . P'ebruary 5.?Michael
Killilea, a dairyman, who was employed
by J. I*. Morgan on his estate at East
island, uien cove, nas won a verdict

night gave him a verdict for $20,000.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS I
JEALOUSOF RIGHTS
Fear the President May Constitute
Himself Leader of
Legislative Program.
CONDITIONS AT PRESENT
" ARE IN CHAOTIC STATE
Mr. Wilson's Demand for PreparedI
ness Perplexes the Members?Un
able to Agree on Details.
"Needed?A czar. Apply to
democratic party, House of Representatives,
Cnitcd States Capitol."
This is the way the republicans
good-humoredly characterize the
plight of their opponents in the
present legislative situation. Rut,
speaking seriously, there is hehind
the taunting persiflage some
basis for its use. which the demo-j
crats admit when talking among I
themselves. ^
Here is the situation:
President Wilson demands of his
party in congress uic ciiiicuueni
broad legislation for military preparedness.
That will cost money which
must be raised by taxation, to initiate
which devolves upon th?? House of Representatives.
1-eader Kitchin of the House says:
"How much do you want, and what
for?" Then the trouble begins. The
President cannot answer. because,
while he knows what he wants and approximately
how much it will cost, the
committee on naval affairs and the
committee on military affairs, which
must report the program, cannot agree
with the administatlon?that is to say,
with the President and the executive
departments.
Leader Kitchin's Attitude.
So it falls out that l.eader Kitchin
chairman of the ways and means committee,
which body has absolute jurisdiction
over the subject of raising the
money, figuratively reaches for his
trusty pipe, fills it with North Carolina
sun-cured tobacco, and, leaning
back in his chair, says: "Well, come
across with your program, its scope
and cost, and T will see what can be
done about raising the money-."
The President returns from his western
trip, and, according to credible re- j
ports in the public prints, is convinced
that he has "started something:" for
these reluctant democrats in the House.
And as soon as he gets back he Amis
the situation in the House chaotic, as
described. There is no man to take
hold of things and push them. That's
why the republicans say their democratic
friends need a czar.
There will not be any czar, in the
accepted sense of the word, such as
i the late Thomas B. Heed and the present
Joseph G. Cannon did and does accept
as a term of high raise In all the
understanding of the appellation, but
there is a man whose power and influence
will be exerted not essentially and
primarily to the benefit of Woodrow
Wilson, but to the crying need and advantage
of the democratic party. This
man's name is Champ Clark, and he
is the Speaker of the House. Some
things which are happening indicate
that the old-time prestige and power
of this office are likely t<> he restored.
Spirit of Irony Manifested.
There is a spirit of delightful irony j
in the situation, which many men in i
Congress appreciate, and perhaps Mr. '
Clark himself. *I^ook at it: A few years
ago was witnessed the stirring spectacle
of Champ Clark standing up in
the House and leading the flght which
resulted in depriving the Sneaker of
the House of Representatives of his
century-old power, and relegating him
to the role of a moderator at a church
gathering. Then Mr. <'lark was elected
Speaker, and re-elected. His was the
lonesome job for some time. About all
he had was the gavel, the mace and a
white rose in his buttonhole, with the
authority to summon some aspiring
gentleman to preside over the committee
of the whole.
But things are changed, and bear this
in mind particularly; from now on
Champ Clark is going to be not only
the titular Speaker of the House, but
also a very active and potential leader
of his party. He will be working
for the democratic party first, however,
his friends declare, though he is quite
willing that President Wilson may get
any personal advantage out of his efforts
that may accrue after the democratic
party has had the first skimming
of the cream.
In Fear of Usurpation.
Speaker Clark does not get his newly
asserted leadership from any change
in rules or procedure, but it is said,
from realization of many democrats in
the House that they are threatened
with usurpation by the executive of
constitutionally endowed legislative
prerogatives unless some one in the
House steps in and asserts the rights
of the House.
In other words, if President Wilson
cannot find anybody in the House to
stand by the administration, it is feared
he may deem it necessary to be the
leader of the House himself, to deal
with individuals and factions, and the
thought is riot pleasant to some of the
older democrats who are jealous of the
demarkation between the executive and
legislative branches of the government.
Kvery day witnesses increasing tendency
among the democrats to rally
around Speaker Clark, consult him and
listen to his advice. The Speaker's
|? hAo-ltinino* a era in
to be a council room of the men in
the House who are charged with responsibility
for legislation, and the
unison of party action.

Charged With Slaying
Physician Pendina.
JUDGE, IN CHARGE, SAYS 1
LAW KNOWS NO COLOR
Three Separate Verdict* May Be Returned.
Though All Were Indicted
Together. #
PROVIDENCE. R. I.. February S
The case of Mrs. Elizabeth F. Mohr,
Cecil Brown and Henry H. Spell man,
charged with the murder of Dr. C.
Franklin Mohr, the woman's husband,
last August, was given to the jury at
10:45 o'clock today.
Judge Stearns in his charge to the
jury declared that it was their duty if
they concluded the state had proved its
case to say "tluilty," whatever the
consequences, in each case or in any
case.
Charge to the Jury.
"The law recognizes no color, no
creed," the court said. "Pay no regard
to the fact that one defendant is a
woman and two are colored men.
They are three citizens on trial and I
charge you not to allow any prejudice
or feeling, excepting an honest desire
to do impartial justice, to enter your
minds.
"The law in regard to principals in
a crime." the court explained, "is this:
Where any persons are present, aiding
and abetting in the actual commission
of a crime?in this case it is murder?
they are equally guilty with those who
actually commit the crime. Mrs. Mohr
has been indicted as an accessory hefore
the fact. If you find she hired,
aided, procured, assisted one or both
of the other defendants, she is guilty.rf
Jury to Give Three Verdicts.
Judge Stearns then explained the degree
of proof necessary to convict, saying:
"All three defendants are in
dieted together, but you will bring in
three verdicts. The verdicts will be
individual, as though there had been
three separate trials."
The court asserted that under the law
an accessory cannot be convicted unless
one or both of the principals is
found guilty, and. therefore, that it was
logical that the jury first determine
whether Brown and Spellman were
guilty.
Discusses Healis' Testimony.
Discussing the testimony of George W.
Healis, Dr. Mohr's chauffeur, who turned
state's evidence, the court said the
reliance to be placed on his story rested
with the jurors.
"Healis is a puzzling figure in this S
case." said the judge. "It's a fair question
how much of his statement is true
and. how much is false."
court said no confession was
made oy Mrs. aonr, out mai, accuraing
to the state, she had made threats
against her husband. It was for the
jury to determine the value of these alleged
threats.
Inasmuch as confessions are only to
be taken as against the persons making
them, it was also pointed out, the alleged
confessions of Brown and Spellman
were not to be considered a a
against Mrs. Mohr.
Mrs. Mohr left the courtroom shortly
after the judge's charge ^*as finished, although
a large crowd remained, evidently
with the expectation that an early verdict
would be brought in. Judge Stearns left
the courthouse at 12:43 o'clock, at whictr,^QiP
hour luncheon was ordered for the jury,/'
