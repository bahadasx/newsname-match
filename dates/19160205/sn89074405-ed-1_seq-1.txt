WILSON DEMANDS
ARE DISCUSSED
Attempt to Gain Admission
That Action Was Illegal
Writes Germans.
Berlin, Feb. 6.—There are no new
developments here in the Lusitanla
case, while news is being awaited
from Washington. With regard to
the proposals of Secretary Lansing
on the subject of submarine warfare,
and the arming of merchantmen, It
is stated they are not yet submitted
to Germany.
The press continues to discuss the
cabled reports regarding these pro
posals. The Koelnische Volkszeltung,
the organ of the Catholic party, says
the proposals are absolutely inac
ceptablej as their acceptance would
signify the abandonment of the en
tire German submarine campaign
against the commerce of the allies.
With regard to the Lusitanla ques
tion, the Volkszeltung says that if
Wilson is correctly reported as de
manding that Germany recognize that
the sinking of the Lusitanla is illegal
and unjueified by the theory of re
prisals, then there can be only one
answer—flat refusal.
Considered at Washington.
Washington, Feb. 5.—The Lusitanla
case, again to the forefront of inter
national problems, is occupying the
serious consideration of the Washing
ton government.
President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing carefully went over the pro
posal presented last night by Count
•on Bernstorff, the German ambassa
dor. Until they have decided there
will be no change in the virtual dead
lock to which the negotiations came
weeks ago—perhaps not then. Offi
cials are emphatic in declaring that
whatever gravity there is In the sit
uation it was potential.
Washington, Fob. 5.—President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing will
not begin the discussion of Germany's
latest answer in the Lusitanla nego
tiations before Monday. The presi
dent already has the proposal from
Berlin before him, and wants to go
over it carefully before he begins con
Terences with Lansing.
There is an undertone of expecta
tion that the two governments -will be
able to find, a common ground for
agreementin official declarations that
Berliti's reply ha* not made the gitiii.
tion any more serious.

Dutch Newspapers of all
Faiths are United in Con
demning Action.
The Hague, Feb. 6.—Dutch news
papers, both pro-German and anti
German, are unanimous in demanding
from Germany a prompt explanation
and reparation for the torpedoing of
the Dutch tank steamer Artemis by
a German torpedo boat in the North
Sea.
The newspapers call for the punish,
merit of the German commander, who
is responsible for what is described as
a violation of the law, and an unjusti
fiable act of war against the Nether
lands.
The Vaderland recalls previous
German "errors," and dwells on. the
d.inger of further incidents of this
nature. Incidentally, it asks what the
British fleet is doing while a con
spicuously colored Uermar torpedo
flotilla is calmly cruising on the busi
est steamer track between the Hook
of Holland and Noordhinder light
ship.
The Nieuwe Courant treats the case
as a breakdown of "the vaunted Ger
man organization and discipline,"
which'it says, seems urgently to need
improvement, especially from the
viewpoint of the safety of lives and
property of neutrals. It demands
complete pecuniary and political sat
isfaction from Germany and asks:
"Did the German flotilla attempt
perhaps to remove all ships from the
neighborhood of a sinking Zeppelin
and lire wildly and blindly when its
plan did not seem to succeed?" This,
it is s?Jd, ml«*ht act,

Washington, D. C., Feb. 5.—The

ment expressing Its regret at the dis
position evidenced In some states to
draw the line of cleavage between the
state and national banks which are
members of the federal reserve sys

It has taken form, the statement
says, by the efforts in some states to
separate the existing bankers' socie
ties into separate organizations, one
for the state, and one for the Nation
al banks.
"It appears to the board," says the
statement,"that af common ground
for -both .groups of Jwn.it* should be
sought rather thai ground for separa
tion. It is.to behoped that a wise
counsel will prevail and the conviction
gradually assert itself that there
should be no feeling of competition
between the state and national gov
ernment which might produce a tend
ency to legislate the downward as to
banking standards or create condi
tions of uncertainty rather than safety
for-the mere purpose of making one
system more attractive from the prof
it making standpoint than the other."

GIRLS KILLED LUSITANIA CASE
BACK AT START
Herr Wolff Says Arguments
on Question Are Not
Proper.
Berlin, via London, Feb. 5.—Theo
dor Wolff, editor in chief of the Ber
liner Tageblatt, in a long leading
article, commented yesterday on the
German-American situation. The tone
of tha article, although restrained. Is
urni,
'"Many parson**" says Herr Wolff,
-^had long believed the Lusitanla mat
ter settled, but one must, unfortunate
ly, say that it has become rather criti
cal. Following the long oral and
written negotiations, the question is
back where it began, namely, in the
demands of the first American note
that Germany indemnify the Lusitanla
victims, not voluntarily* but as an ad
mission that the torpedoing of the
vessel was illegal."
Arguments Not Proper.
Herr Wolff refers to the arguments
in the case advanced by Berlin and
Washington and then says:
"One gets no further with these
juristic arguments and it Is not
proper, nor in view of the situation
possible, to twist about the circle, any
longer. Germany must carry out the
war to a victorious end, and has a
right to demand that everything
necessary to hasten this end be done.
The chancellor has to decide the
course on the basis of Information
which is unknown to the public. He
certainly will not let himself be mis
led by the cry of those who think a
breach of relations would mean a
grave danger.
"He knows better than others
whether, despite the peaceful and
quiet attitude of a part of the Amer
ican congress, the American govern
ment is decided on hostile actions."
Want Quick Victory.
In conclusion Herr Wolff says: "We
all wish the quickest and complete
victory possible, and a peace in which
the German people can heal their
wounds and restore their prosperity.
If a decisive step is now to be taken
in the Lusitania conflict, one must
consider quietly and dispassionately
and to the furtherest end of the way
where this step can lead us."
