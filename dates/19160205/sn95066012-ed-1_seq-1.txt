Judge Ibham's grandson afterward
married .Miss Alta Rockefeller, eldest
daughter of John D. Rockefeller.
John S. Robinson became governor
of the Btate by vote of the joint As
sembly In 1853 and was the last demo-
jitic : governor iu the state's history.
Sjjliis docket also gives the names of
v.Tknowu lawyers here in the vil
lagJ tho time. George W. Harmon
was " pf these afterward cashier
of the "il Stark Bank. A. P. Lyman
was another, living for many years
in the homestead occupied by the late
Judge Sibley. Trenor V. Park and
his brother-in-law, Nathaniel B. Hall
were officers of the court mentioned
in the docket.
Hon. Robert Pierpont was the pre
siding judge at this session, 65 years
ago. The assistant judges were
Perez Harwood, Jr., and Cyrus Far
well. Harmon Caufield of Arlington
was states attorney. Samuel H.
Blackmer was county clerk and James
S. Merrill, father of John V. D. S.
Morrill, was sheriff.
The members of the bar from Man
chester were also printed in the doc
ket. They include A. L. Miner, Leon
ard Sargent, Daniel Roberts. Jr., au
thor of Roberts Digest. Ellas B.
Burton, S. Swift and Harvey K. Fow
ler are alao given, the last named dy
ing but a few years ago at an ad
vanced age. Even when well into his
eighties, Mr. Fowler was a regular at
tendant and interested spectator of
court sessions and rarely missed a
sitting.
Hon. Tarrant Sibley, father of
Judge Sibley, was at one time a law
partner of John S. Robinson. Mr.
Robinson was a brilliant orator who
died suddenly in middle life while iu
Charleston, S. C, where he was a dele
gate at the celebrated convention
which nominated Jaines S. Brecken
ridge to run against Lincoln on the
democratic ticket. His remains were
brought back to this village and sev
eral elderly people remember his
funeral.
The docket is a 15-pago booklet
with cheap gieen parser covers. To
day the couit docket contains a brief
history or each case showing when ac
tion was begun, papers filed, etc. The
docket of 1851 was nothing more thai:
a memorandum book, onch case being
given about an inoh of space with
the name of the .plaintiff and defeu
iiiC:ff iu the ton of each space in the
center in small type, For this reatpu
much interesting information about
the cases that were triod in that ses
sion so long ago, i3 lost. Chief among
the entries, however, are the follow
ing; Warrens, Hart.. and Leslie of
Troy vs. the Bonniugton Iron Com
pany;. Buckh-y &. Claflin of Now Yorlc
vs. ye. Noyea. 'i no piainun m tiua
case afterward developed into the

fornia had litigation with
Henry Noyes and Thomas McDaniels
had a case against Dennis J. Joyce,
-well-known in the history of Shafts-
bury. Lyman & Park had a grievance
against John C. HazweJl aired in this
court, and Lyman Patchin brought ac
tion against C. V. Park. Enoa Rudd
sought damages of David Rudd and
Enos-Adams Jirought a suit against
Lafayette' Lyons, father of Homer
Lyons and grandfather of Ward
Lyons, ' '..'.':'- ' ,;
This terni of court was jield before
the railroad entered the town and an
there, were practically no corporations
in thoHf! days, most of the actions are
for petty disagreements over the pay
ments of bills, sale of cattle and-personal
property and collection of
debts. ;.
The book was printed by B. G. and
J. I. C. Cook, afterwards publishers
of the Bennington Banner.
Hardly any of the names of those
participating in that session are liv
ing today. The sessions of court at
that date were calander days and even
though the docket contained only
trivial cases, far, more Interest was
taken In court procedure than a ses
sion of important cases arouses to
day. The farmers came from all parts
of the county and made sleepy old

sncozy place in those days take on
the aspect of a busy country town,
All of the documents were hand-writ
ten, a laborious process eince type
writers were not invented, and the
business of copying these by hand
was one of the important tasks de
volving on the young legal apprentice
who sought his education in the olflce
of some older attorney. Many of thorn
were on parchment.
The book tella a pathetic story to
old people in the village and as a con
trast with the modern court docket,
is an Interesting relic.
A SPECIAL FEATURE
In the Interest of Bennington Home
Trade.
V'e all know tlmt we have the
most beautiful and fascinating town
in New England, wo all know that as
an important commercial center, ex
tensive manufacturing plants und a
charming residential village, Benning
ton ranks with any town in the coun
try. Thla is the reason that the Ben
nington Banner publishes in today's
issuo an interesting iocal article en
titled, "Home Trade Slogan of Ben
nington's'' Booster Club. It - intro
duces three loyal and optimistic Ben
ningtonians' who- vrocliani, with no
uncertain sound its many attractions
and the enterprise of its merchants.
Our many "thousand readers will find
the wise talk of the colonel, the doc
tor and the judge, of an instructive
and illuminating character. Home
trade should always bo preached with
dynamic force; the slogan can net be
repeated too often. "With live wires
for merchants and a loyal people,
there isj no limit to the growth of Ben
nington;" say the colonel, the doctor
ami the judge.

CURIOUS ORIGIN OF A LAW.

of PeVr Thelluason's Will.
Tfie. Tiiellus.son law, niieo enacted by
the iirtUsb government, was a law to
regulate the disposition of property
liy v.iii n ml to prevent, the eices-sive
iiecuiiiulritiou of estates. It had a cu
rioirs origin..

and the survivors of them. The ac
cumulation would have been enormous.
The will waa contested, but was held
valid. In order, however, to prevent
Kueli a disposition of property In the
future, parMament passed what was
cal'.ed tin.) Tiiolhisson net, or accumula

. When 'Peter Tliellusson's last sur
viving grandson died, in 1S50, a ques
tion arose as to whether the eldest
male descendant or the male descend
ant of tho eldest son should inherit the
property, and this question was de
cided on appeal by the house of lovd.-i
in .lime, isr. The Thellusson will ami
the legislation growing out of It were

BULBS IN A BOWL
An Ea3y Way to Cultivate Miniature
Floating Gardens.
A novel way of growing bulbs, sueh
aa crocuses, has been tried with good
success. After securing the bulbs the
nest thing is to get one t r two rather
large corks. Through these holes are
bored and the bulbs fitted into the
oieiiinss in such a way that the under
side, from widen the roots spring, Is
near the lower part of the cork.
Now obtain a largo shallow bowl nud
f'tl this wi'.h pure water. Float the
eorku, with the bulbs in place, on the
surface and ret the -.viwlu thing, aildo
!n a rather shady position for two or
three weeks. At the did of this time
it wRl be noticed that the roots are
growing down into the water; thence
forward a place in a sunny window
should be selected. 1 ''
- Tiie upper shoots of the bulbs wlil
tnrt to grow rapidly, and at this time
it Is a good plan to arrange a little
moss to hide the upper surface of the
corks, or, if preferred, however, gas.s
or some other seed, taich ns cress, may
be sown to provide a green covering.
There is nothing to do but to keep
the bowl well supplied with water and
chanue tliis now and ngaiu. Finally
the liowers emerge, ninl then the effect
Is extremely pretty. The bulbs maybe
planted in this way any time up to
early Jautiary, though naturally the
sooner they 'are started the earlier they
will bloom. S. Leonard Bastiu "
