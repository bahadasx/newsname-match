takejit upon himself to at once learn
thls 'soag and the creed, which every
trufcittzen of the Nation should know.
Through the efforts of leaders of the
move; tlie faculties of the schools will
be'requested to se to It that the chil

?Tie' movement is in accord with
, eueat recently made by the commit'
KS^niarrangeroents for the Independ

fiiuests that the Governors of the

in'e.a proclamation to the effect that

Thus a shout of patriotism will go
Effl>?frora thousands of hearts all over

{Stimulating patriotism as perhaps

iNEspecIalti\ at this time when the
citations of iiurope are at war and the
officials of the nation as well as her

preparedness and a larger and better

rfjflt'has been suggested that the school
children bo formed In line with the
flag of the nation, and march to the
court house. Such a demonstration
could be made a grand and spectacu
" V.sight and It is believed by those
close touch with the move that
Irmont will vie with other towns in

Second One at the M. P.
Temple on .Thursday
Evening.
Local Christian Endcavorers are
planning for splendid meeting to
be held Sunday evening at 6:15 o'clock
in the Central Christian church oa
Walnut avenue, when the five Chris
tian Endeavor Unions of the city will
participate In the meeting which will
celebrate Christian Endeavor week,
which begins tomorrow and extends
through the following Sunday.
Owing to the fact that local En
deavorers are busy with plans for
the state convention to be held in this
city on June 27, 2S and 29, the entire
week will net be observed In this
city.
Two meetings will be held during
the week, the first on Sunday even
ing at tho Central Christian church
and the second will be a railroad so
cial and parcel post sale to be held
at the M. P. Temple on Thursday even
ing of next week.
At the Sunday evening meting, two
speakers from each of the five unions
will make short addresses and musi
cal numbers will feature the program.
Christian Endeavor week is In ob
servance of the anniversary of the or
ganization of the National Union
which was organized in Portland,
Maine, in February, 1881.
A union Christian Endeavor organi
zation was perfected in this city in
June, 1890, composed of the young
people from the various churches of
the city and the meetings were held in
the old M. P. church which stood on
the site of the Smith residence on
Quincy street.
Twenty-five years -ago in October,
1890, the organization of the state
?wjes perfected in- this city and -short-"
ly afterward the -various churches
withdrew and formed separate organ
izations.
The M. P. Temple C. E. society
is 25 years old while the Presbyterian
lacks about two years of being as
old an organization. The other church
of the city which support live organi
zations aro the First M. P. church, the
Central Christian and the Grace Luth
eran.
The city union of Christian Endea
vor societies is making elaborate plans
for the entertainment of the state
convention In June which marks the
twenty-fifth anniversary of that or
ganization.
GERMANY TO RAISE
SUGAR BEET PRICE
Encouragement Needed to
Stimulate Larger Pro
duction.
BERLIN, Jan. 20.?(Correspondence
ol The Associated Press)?An increase
In the maximum wholesale price o{
sugar beets from 35 pfennigs per hun
dredweight to 1.35 or even 1.50 is held
to be necessary if production Is to be
encouraged sufficiently to Insure a
normal crop In 1916. Representatives
of the sugar industry, and of agricul
ture In general, gathered recently In
the ministry of the interior to dis
cuss .the sugar bee.t problem. Accord
ing to the best obtainable estimates
the 1916 sugar beet, production from
the beet crop.will total only 30,000,001)
hundredweight, as against a normal
production of from 60 to 5 hundred
weight
The reason for the decreased pro
duction ilea primarily in the high
price of grain. Farmers find it more
profitable to plant their farms to
wheat than to beets because the wheat
brings them higher prices. Therefore,
If beets are to be grown again, the
price for them must be increased.
Many of the sugar representatives
pleaded for a maximum price at 1.60
marks or even 2 marks per hundred
weight. It was pointed out that the
cost of labor has greatly Increased and
that many other fixed .charges that
enter into the production - of sugar
from beets have gone up. The majority
price of -1.60 was sufficient t oinduce
Increased planting of sugar beets, to
a point whereby about.40,000,000 hun
dredweight would be raised in all prob
ability. This new price, it is proposed,
will become effective Stptember 1,
1916, before the, crop is harvested. The
40,000,000 hundredweight it is believed
will .be amply sufficient for all of Ger
many's needs.
.The proposed Increase In the
price, of sugar beets wil: cause a cor
responding .Increase. In the price of
raw^sugar.' It now Is controlled.by a'
.maxlanm-price of *12 ma^ks per bun
.drSaSfoght, and, will go;op at leastHSl

INVESTIGATION STARTED
Believe Great Traffic Artery
Over St. Lawrence is
Menaced.
(By Associated Press)
MONTREAL. (Jan., Feb. 5?What Is
I believed to haye been an attempt to
blow up the Victoria bridge -was frus
trated last night by militia guards,
It was learned today.
About midnight the guards noted
a man malting his way toward the
bridge on the lee. He was picked out
by a search light and when challeng
ed retreated without answer.
About 4 a. m. a man was again de
tected trying to reach the bridge from
the Ice. When he refused to answer
a challenge he was flred at but he
made his escape .
An Investigation started by mlltla
authorities has convinced them that
an attempt to destroy the bridge was
intended.
The Victoria bridge crosses the St.
Lawrence and is used by the Grand
Trunk and the Delaware and Hud
son railway. It Is a mile and a half
in length and has been guarded by
soldiers since the outbreak of the
war.
City Interested in
Freight Rate Case
City commissioner J. Walter Barnes
has taken up with the Interstate Com
merce Commission the matter regard
ing the raise in freight tariffs on cin
der between Fairmont and Kingmont
Last summer the city purchased all
the cinders it could obtain, at King
mont and paid for havlngjthem halued
here by the railroad at a rate of 21
cents per ton. Since that time the
tariff was raised to 84 cents a tonO.
This rate is shown on the Interstate
Commerce Commission's schedule.
On account of this Increase in rate It
will l>e cheaper to buy slag in Pitts
burgh than it Is to buy cinder in King
mont and haVe it hauled here. Also It
Is cheaper to haul coal here from
Kingmont than it is to haul cinder.
Coal from Kingmont to Fairmont Is
but 30 cents per ton, and it is pormis
sable to have certain cinder shipped
as coal. That the city will have to
ask to have their cinder shipped here
as coal is a theory about the city hall
today.

East Side Children
This evening at 7:30 Dr. Cambron
