PHILIPPINE BILL.
PASSED SENATE;
DEMOS LINE DP
Measure Giving Islanders Self-Gov-eminent
With String Attached
Adopted After Hitchcock
Motion Beaten.
SIX REPUBLICANS FOR IT
Will Go to Honse With Approral of
President and Will be Pressed
', to the Front.
RSATT.'F.Ti TTa WYVRPTS RPT.ViTH
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4. The Phil
ippine v)Ul, which would extend to
the islands a greater degree of self
government and would authorize the
president to grant them absolute in
dependence within four years, passed
the senate tonight, 62 to 24. Various
democratic senators led by Chairman
Stone of the foreign relations com
mittee, tried unsuccessfully to se
cure amendment of certain features
of the ' independenc clause, but in
th end the democrats, Joined by six
progressive republicans, voted solid
ly for the measure.
It Is understood the bill will go to the
bouse with the backing- of President Wil
son and will be preceded for early pas
n(. There has been little Indication
of what.actlon the house will take, but
administration leader tonight seemed
confident that the bill. Including- the In
dependence feature, which democratlo
senators declare sonares It with the Balti
more platform, would have the approval
of the house democratlo majority.
' Worrts Sappnrts Bill.
The republican senators who voted for
the bill were: Borah". Clapp. Kenyon, La-
follette. 1 Norris and Works. By over
whelming majorities the senate had re
fused to modify the Clarke amendment,
adopted several days ago, which con
tains the Independence provision and also
gives the president authority to extend or
withhold Independence at theend of four
years, If be should find conditions in the
island unfavorable, The time would be
extended, however, only until an incom
ing; congress oould ocmalder the subject.
Senator Strong- declared the bill was in
reality hot an Independence measure at
all, because of the extension provision,
and offered an amendment to eliminate
it, but bis proposal waa voted down, 0
to 17. .Senator Hitchcock, chairman of
the Philippine committee, sought to
amend the bill by extending- independence
within four years,' on condition" that the
people and' legislature of the Philippine
should ratify a constitution Thta-waa re
jected ft to a
Wkat Biam em.
"I am making- a laat appeal for What I
think Is good faith and Just treatment of
the Philippines," said Senator Stone la
urging bis amendment. "I am unquts
tlonahly and unconditionally In favor of
carrying out the pledge of the democratic
party by relinquishing control over the
Philippine Islands completely. I am not
In favor of conferring Independence with
a string to it. I oppose any provision
which will make It possible for a ruture
president of the United State to send
this issue back to congress. We are, In
bis bill, not offering Independence In
fact, but merely a suggestion ef Jt to
some future president."
Senator Norris, in opposing a provision
In the bill empowering the president to
retain, naval bases in the Philippines, de
clared President Wilson had been con
verted from a man of peace to a mili
tarist. "The president," said Senator Norris,
'"recently announced-a program of pre
paredness contrary to views he held a
year ago, and In the last few days he
has changed his mind on that Nowlie
says he la in favor of the United States
having the largest navy In the world. If
that is his idea, he will want to retain
not only one but a do sen naval stations
In the Philippines."
' Smith Scores Dmu.
Senator William Alden Smith scored
he democrats for their determination to
give up the Philippines, and declared the
American people did not wish to see the
American flsg over the Islands hauled
down. 4

"The steamship, with its decks cov

BRITAIN DEMANDS
RETURN OF APPAM
Formal Action of Sir Cecil Spring
Rice Foreshadows Another Diplo
mat Tilt with London.
LANSING HOLDS TO PRIZE VIEW
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4. Sir Cecil
Spring Rice, the British ambassador,
today presented a, formal demand on
behalf of hie government for the re
turn to British ownership of the
liner Appam, taken by a German
prise crew. A new diplomatic con
troversy with Great Britain is fore
shadowed, aa the United States
practically has decided to hold the
prize Is Germany's.
Secretary Lansing Indicated today that
the United States had decided to hold
the Prussian-American treaty governs ths
case of the Appam, as Germany contends,
and all' that remained to be decided was
the Interpretation of the application of
the treaty's terms.
The secretary disclosed further that the
sole question to be decided by the Inter
pretation was how long the Appam should
be permitted to remain In American
waters. The treaty guarantees to a Ger
man prise the right to oome and go freely.
If forced to depart German officials have
stated the Appam would be sunk to pre
vent its recapture by the British.
Germany Is expected to contend that
the treaty guarantees the Appam the
right to remain safe In Hampton Roads
until the case goes before a prise court
tor adjudication. Technically the' ship
does not become Germany's prize until
such a court establishes the validity of
Its capture- - - : . -
American Navy
Better Than Ever
.
WASHINGTON. D. C. May 4.-Kr
Admiral Victor Blue, chief of the bureau
of navigation, declared to the house naval
committee today that while the Amer
lean navy Is "better off today than It
ever has been," the most vital weak,
ness Is shortage of officers.
When Secretary Daniels took office,
the admiral said, he waa faced by that
situation and by the further fact that
the number under training at Annapolis
wss reduced one-half that year from
natural causes. Efforts to fill the acad
emy had failed, he said, and It was
necessary for congress to act
Admiral Fletcher's much-discussed
statement that the fleet was short 6,000
enlisted men, he said, was misleading
because the present complements for the
ships were established years ago. He
presented tables to show that American
ships carried more men but fewer offi
cers than foreign vessels of the same
type.

WILSON MAY NOT

New Crisis With Germany Oyer
Lusitania Case Probably Will
Keep Him Home.
WON'T GO FOR DAYS ANYWAY
: WASHINGTON. Feb. 4. Presl
dent Wilson returned from his speak
lng trip for. preparedness today, so
well pleased with Its results that he
probably will make another trip
soon, unless the , Lusitania negotia
tions or some other feature of the
foreign situation develops a critical
stage, preventing his absence from
the capital. ,.,.,
Although no arrangements have
been mads officials indicated tonight
that the possibilities of. the Lust
tanla situation presented the only
obstacle likely to Influence the presi
dent against a second trip. If he
goes, he will visit the south and pos
sibly some far western states. '
Think Trip Success.
Mr. Wilson Is convinced that bis middle-western
trip was a success. ' rta
toitnd at the White House many tele
grams and letters from the section ha
traversed, telling him so, and senators
and representatives had received many
similar messages. The president has
been invited to visit Vlrglnl'a, Kentucky,
Alabama, North Carolina, South Caro
lina, Georgia, Tenneasee, Mississippi, Ar
kansas and Texas, as well aa states In
the northwest and far wjst. His sd
vlsers hsve told htm thsrs was need In
the south particularly for a special ef
fort In favor of hi preparedness plan.
Ths president will not lose the advan
tage in the prepsredness discussion he
believes be has galnsd by his middle
western trip. It was (ndicated today, but
wilt press for sntlon by congress on ths
srmy and navy bills as soon as possible,
lis expects to hold a series . of confer
ences with senators and representatives
during tbe next week. . ' - . .
-Won't Oo for Seeeral Days.
" seemed improbable tonight that the
prealdent would leave en another trip
before February 10. He has a 'mass of
routing business which aooumolatsd .dur
ing his absenoa from Washington ' and
It Is understood the Lusitania and ' ths
Appam caaes will be'gtVen Ills close at
tention for. the next, few days. .
It was generally understood that the
entire quewtkiR - of another trip 'hinged
on the outcome of ' the ' Lusitania. nego
tiutions. -Should It bj favorable he- Is
almost certain to go, but should there
he sny really serious developments he
will give up the plan. '
The president got Into communication
with Secretary lousing as soon as-hs
reached the White House today and
while no announcement was made it wss
understood the Lusitania case was-foremost
among the subjects discussed.
