16,000 CHEER
DEMAND FOR
RUSH ACTION
President Demands Defense
Steps Be Taken This
Month.
SINGS AMERICA WITH CROWD
"American Lives and Commerce
Must be Defended," Says
Wilson.
Kansas City, Mo., Feb. 3. Presi
dent Wilson demanded last night that
steps be taken during the present
month to back him in defending
American lives and commerce abroad.
His demand met with the shouts of
applause from an audience of 16,-
000 persons, who waved American
flags, leaped to their seats and
cheered.
When the President ceased speak
ing he leaned forward and asked the
great throng to join him in singing
"America." The band played softly,
the audience stood and the words of
America's national anthem came in a
glorious burst of song.
The big crowd was for the Presi
dent from the start. It waited pa
tiently an hour to see him and
cheered itself hoarse in a three-minute
demonstration when he appeared.
Sixteen thousand heard him; 20,000
were turned away, and 10,000 more
tried to glimpse him as he left his ho
tel for the hall.
"Why, some men in Washington
are questioning if wo could get the
500,000 men for which the Govern
ment is asking," he said at one point
of his address.
'Would they volunteer?"
A man in the far end of the. hall
shouted his answer over the heads of
the crowd: "Yes," he cried.
A dozen men a score fifty
echoed the word and the hall was in
a turmoil. President Wilson smiled
and held out his hand.
"Why, I believe," he said as the
tumult died, "you could raise the,
500,000 in almost any State. I believe
you could get 5,000 men right here
in this audience."
"I have been thrilled by the experi
ences of these last few days," the
President said, "and I will go home
to Washington and smile at the
gentlemen who say the United States
is not awake."
"Those gallant men who sit on the
hill in Washington and make our laws
are going to deliver the goods "
The crowd cheered. "Don't misun
derstand me. they are going to de
liver the goods because you want the
goods delivered."
The President said the time had
come for him to ask his fellow citi
izens to "get up on your hind legs
and talk and tell the people who rep
resent you what the nation desires
and demands. The thing that every
body in a democracy is listening for
is the tramp! tramp! tramp! of the
facts.
"I have come to ask you what is
back of me in this task of preserving
at once peace and your honor," the
President said. "The judge on the
bench has the law back of him with
its bailiffs, sheriffs, National Guards
men and the United States army, but,
if you ignore in some foreign capital
what the President urges as the'rights
of the people and Government of the
United States, what is there back of
it?
"It is necessary that I should come
and ask you this question, because I
don't know how long the mere words
and insistence of your Government
will prevail to maintain your honor
and the dignity and power of the na
tion. "There may come a time I pray
God it may never come, but it may in
spite of everything we can do upon
us when I shall have to nski 'I have
said my say; who stands back of it?'
Where Is tliat force by which the
right and majesty of the United States
are to be vindicated and asserted?"
The President declared the need
was immediate and tliat action should

BRUMFIELD
IS CHOSEN
As The Representative of II. H.
S. iii The Madisonville
Contest.
HE IS GIFTED AS AN ORATOR
Take a Good One to Beat
Him on February
25th.
Thursday night at the Christian
church the Preliminary Contest was
held. Potter Lackey, the President
of the Delphic Society, presided over
the meeting with a great deal of dig
nity. After a short evening address by
Mr. Lackey, he named the judges who
were Messrs. W. P. Winfree, Her
man Southall, and Frank Rives.
Edward Breathitt was the first
speaker of the evening. His subject
was "Our Country," and he deliver
ed this speech in a very charming
manner.
Robert Brumfield was the next
speaker and he spoke on "The Shad
ow of the Cloud." Mr. Brumfield's
speech and style of delivery were es
pecially adapted to each other.
After Mr. Brumfield's speech, the
judges retired and returned in a few
minutes with the decision. They
chose Mr. Brumfield to represent the
High School in the coming contest on
February 25tli.
Robert Brumfield should have little
trouble in winning in the contest. He
has a wonderful speech and will cer
tainly represent the school in the best
manner possible. His diction is ex
cellent, his manner pleasing and he
undoubtedly possesses talent and
graces of oratory. His fault is that he
does not speak loud enough for a
large building. If he will put a little
more fire into his utterances, he will
make a winner.
He is the son of Mr. and Mrs. L. O.
Brumfield.

MEETING FOR
MONDAY NIGHT
Poultry Improvement Club
Getting Busy As Time
Draws Near.
MRS. GRAVES STARTS FEB. 15
To Organize The Poultry
Clubs Throughout The
County.
The regular monthly meeting of the
Christian County Poultry Improvc
Association will be held on Monday
night February 7th, at the H. B. M. A.
Several matters of information will
come up for discussion. Among
which will be the working out of
plans for the Boys' and Girls' Clubs
and the matter of securing eggs, not
only for the club work but for all
who contemplate breeding White
Wyandottes in the county.
At this time there seems to be a
scarcity of eggs and stock in the
country, nearly all breeders reporting
few eggs to sell. The breed is be
coming so popular that eggs and
stock are being booked for shipment
by breeders up to their capacity.
The opinion of the poultry breeders
over the country is that in a very few
years White Wyandottes will head
the list in popularity; for they do well
in the Northern states and in the
Southern states.
Dr. Raymond Pearl, biologist of the
Maine Agricultural Experiment Sta
tion at Orono, Maine, who has had
wide experience with the White Wy
andotte says: "The White Wyandotte
I look upon as one of the substantial,
permanent sorts of poultry,, the value
of which for all-round utility purposes
is unsurpassed. It has a very wide
adapability as to climatic conditions,
giving a good account of itself wher
ever placed. In a cold climate such
as we have here in Maine the White
Wyandotte make splendid winter egg
producers, when properly bred and
cared for. Useful comparative
studies which I have made of the egg
production of different parts of the
world have shown that the White
Wyandottes stand in a leading place
in this respect in comparison with
other American breeds."
D. J. Taylor, Field Agent in Poul
try Husbandry Georgia State College,
at Athens, Georgia, is also a White
Wyandotte enthusiast.
Mr. Taylor says: "The White
Wyandotte is one of the breeds of
chickens we have recommended to
the farmers of this state. We recom
mended this breed of chickens be
cause we felt it would come as close
to filling the needs of the farmer as
any other breed. What the farmer
wants Is a chicken that is first of all a
good layer, a layor not only in the
spring but in the fall and winter.
Secondly, the farmer wants a chicken
that is a good mother and a good
setter, this requirement the White
Wyandotte fills to tho satisfaction of
all. The farmers of this state want a
chicken that is a good fryer at an
early age and the White Wyandotte
again is here with the goods. Few
farmers, however, are raising White
Wyandottes because they cannot get
the eggs to make a start."
: CAN SAYS NO.
The new attorney general has ruled
like Ids predecessor that tho result of
the election for the county as a whole
will not have the effect to authorizo
the sale of liquor in some district of
the county that has previously voted
"dry" under the Ik d option law and
therefore it would not bo lawful to
license the sale of liquor in the town
of Pembroke.
