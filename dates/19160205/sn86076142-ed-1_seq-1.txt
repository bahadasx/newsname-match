ST. PAUL'S THREATENED
BY SENILE DECAY
SEAT OF TROUBLE IS UNEVEN
DISTRIBUTION OF WEIGHT
OF THE DOME
I llr Aaaoc-lated Preaa.)
LONDON, Feb. 5. Again the atten
tion of the public has been called to
the danger of St. Paul's Cathedral
collapsing through "senile decay,"
and an appeal for funds is made by
the dean to hasten the repairs.
Two years ago the sum of $350,000
was asked by the cathedral preserva
tion board, and of this only about
$150,000 has been so far subscribed.
It was then stated "by the examining
engineers that the original architect,
the great Wren, had been very spar
ing in his use of materials. The con
stant jarring of the building by motor-
bus and other heavy traffic had of
course not been anticipated.
The vast and imperfectly distri
buted weight of the dome is the seat
of the trouble, and the gradual pre
sure of the weight is accelerated by
the rusting of iron ana internal de
generacy. Only the loyalty of the ma
terials lo each other. Bays one au
thority, has kept the mass together.
Repairs done at an earlier period are
found to be entirely inadequate, and
new buttresses and support must be
constructed at soon as the money can
be found. ,
INCREASED VALUATION
. Figures recently compiled by Sec
retary Adamson of the Nevada state
tax commission, show an increase in
the assessed valuation of Reno of
$9,000,000 over that of last year.
The Increase is due to the addition
to the list of taxable property of
many properties which have hither
to escaped taxation. Private car line
companies have been added to the
tax list for the first time.
