WASHINGTON, Feb. 4. The one
word "illegal" as differently inter
preted in the United States and
Germany protrudes from the tenta
tive draft of the Lusitania agreement.
perfected by Ambassador von Bern
storff and Secretary Lansing, as the
stumbling block which has caused
.Berlin to refer to the negotiations as
having reached a crisis and Washing
ton to characterize the situation as
grave.
Germany's answer. presented to
Secretary Lansing today by Count
von Rernstorff, proposes instead of an
out and out admission of illegality of
the method -of submarine warfare
used by th German naval authorities

which Berlin hopes will satisfy the
I'nited States and still not bind Ger
many from continuing the submarine
campaign.
German officials believe that their
previous promise to discontinue sink
ing unresisting merchantmen without
warning brings the submarine cam
paign within the pale of international
law and that any inclusion of that
phase in the Lusitania agreement is
unnecessary and humiliating to the
Imperial government.
The word "illegal" in the draft the
German ambassador transmitted to
his government as meeting all the
contentions of the I nited States is'
taken to have been regarded in Rer- j
lin as being susceptible of applica -
tion not to the Lusitania case alone
but to the entire submarine cam-

The prosecuting attorney's" argu-
. nient occupied the entire afternoon.
Throughout the long session Mrs. Mohr
sat immovable beside her counsel, 'with
the exception of once, when she wept
as the prosecutor asserted there was
no evidence to show that "she ever
looked upon the face of her dead hus
band." Continuing, Mr. Rice said: "The de
fendants, Brown and Spellman. were
out of a job and an offer of $2,000 to
do a job of this kind was an immense
tortune for Bown, and $1,000 to Spell
man was a fortune for him.
" e find out that Mrs. Mohr was
suing her husband for divorce, and
that she knew Miss Berger was going
dowm to Newport that night with him.
Who had the .motive? Then who did
the actual shcoting?
"Mrs. Mohr admitted she had talked
a settlement on a basis of an absolute
divorce for the Newport home and
i $73,000. The feeling was so bitter that
rii
e;irh was trying to do all he or she
j could against the other. That was the
j situation in the summer of 1915.
..Dr- Mohr separated from his wife
a veor and a half before."
Discur-sir.g the status of the divorce
and equity suits pending, Mr. Rice said
that there was every reason why Mrs.

SANTA BARBARA. Cal., Feb. 4
Arthur K. Stearns of Chicago today
concluded his testimony in the John E.
Beale half million dollar estate con
test. The purpose was to show that
Mrs. Lillian Beale had unduly in
fluenced her husband and prevented
the visiting nephew from seeing him
here a couple of years ago
The defense failed 'in the effort to
bar testimony by the two sisters. Mrs.
Clara Benle Vail of Santa Barbara. Mid
Mrs. Delia B. Burke of New Jersey.
The point made by the defense was
that they were not heirs, as Frederick
Beale, their father, and brother of the
late Mr. Beale, was still alive. Mrs.
Burke's testimony, given at 'the first
trial, will be read, while Mrs. Vail was
on the stand today in support of the
contention that undue influence and
fraud were resorted to by Mrs. Beale.
Mr. Beale provided for the education

OTTAWA, Feb. 4 The list of those
who lost their lives in the fire which
destroyed the Canadian parliament
building was fixed tonight at seven.
Five of the bodies still lie beneath the"
ruins. They are those of B. B. Law. a
member of parliament: Deputy Clerk
Laplante, Dominion Constable Des
Jardins, Alphonz Des .lardins, a
plumber, and Randolph Fanning, a
waiter.
While firemen spent the day extin
guishing the smoldering debris, domin
ion government officials were making
plans to erect a new and more impos
ing structure upon the site of the build
ing wrecked by last night's fire. Mean
time, parliament will sit in the Audi
torium of the Royal Victoria Museum
until the new customs house can be
made ready for occupancy.
Although the police frown upon the
theory that a plot was responsible for
the destruction of the building, or that
the fire was started by a bomb, Fire
Chief Graham is quoted as having said
the "fire was set," and that he heard
several explosions. .
Government officials assert they be
lieve the flames were not of incendiary
origin, but they nevertheless are con-
fort to determine whether there is any
basis for a suspicion. Coroner Craig
of Ottawa will hold an inquest on Feb
ruary 17 into the deaths of Mesdames
Bray and Morin, whose bodies are the
only ones thus far recovered. The re
mains of both were taken tonight to
Quebec.
A cordon of police stood guard all
day around the ruins of the building
and held back the thousands who vis
ited the scene.
The Canadian parliament met today
in the Auditorium of the Royal Victo
ria Museum. Speaker Sevigny was
without his robes of office, which were
destroyed in last night's fire.
Premier Borden read messages of
condolence from King George, and
from the Duke of Connaugh -he gov
ernor general, and from the provinces
of the country. He announced there
would be a searching investigation
into the cause of the fire, and that the
business of the session would be con
tinued without interruption.
Sir Wilfred Laurier, opposition
leader, joined in the expression of de
termination to continue the work of
parliament, and added:
"When we gaze upon the ruins upon
the hill, why we still trust that it may
be the result of accident, we are. re
minded of the ruins of Louvain and

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4. In the
name of the British owners of the
steamship Appam, Sir Cecil Spring
Rice, the British ambassador, today
lodged with the state department a
formal request that the ship be
turned over to the British consul
under the 'terms of The Hague con
vention. Notice also was served that it
would be in violation of international
law if the United States permitted
the German prize commander of the
Appam either to increase the effi
ciency of that ship, add to her of
fensive power or recruit his crew.
Lieutenant F.erg has only twenty-two
men in his prize crew at present, a
number insufficient to navigate a
ship as large as the Appam. A com-
Appam from Newport News.
On the Alabama case as a prece
dent, the British contention is that
any changes either in equipment or
personnel of the Appam which would
even in a limited degree give her of
fensive (lower and enable her to prey
on British commerce would be a vio
lation of law for which the United
States could be held responsible.
Although the British government
did not formally ratify The Hague
treat' governing the conduct of neu
tral in maritime warfare, it is held
that most of that contention, and es
pecially the article under which the
release of the Appam is demanded, is
only a crvstallization of principles of
international law in existence before
the conventions were drawn and gen
erally accepted since.
In evidence of its observance of the
principle of denial to belligerents of
the right of sequestering prizes in
neutrdl port, the British government
. Points to the Queen's proclamation
, of Jmie 1S6L issued at the out-
erate privateers were preying freely
on the commerce of the northern
Mates. The British government re
fused such prizes entry into British
ports, which Secretary Seward de
clared to be "the death blow of pri
vateering." The British contention also is that
the old Prussian treaty of 1828 is ob
solete. Nevertheless, there was no

tion presented the only obstacle likely
to influence the president against a
second trip, if he goes, he will visit
the south and possibly some far west
ern states.
Mr. Wilson is convinced that his
middle western trip was a success. He
found at the White House many tele
grams and letters from the section he
traversed, telling him so and senators
and representatives had received many
similar messages. The president has
been Invited to visit Virginia, Ken
tucky, Alabama, North Carolina. South
Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississ
ippi, Arkansas and Texas, as well as
states in the northwest and far west.
His advisers have told him there was
need in the south particularly for a
special effort in favor of his prepared
ness plan.
The president will not lose the ad
vantage in the preparedness discussion
he believes he has gained by his mid
dle western trip, it was indicated to
day, but will press for action hy con
gress on the army and navy bills as
soon as possible. He expects to hold a
series 0f conferences with senators and
representatives during the next week.
It seemed improbable tonight that
the president would leave on another
trip before February 10. It was gen
erally understood that the entire ques
tion of another trip hinged on the out
come of the Lusitania negotiations.
The president got into communica
tion with Secretary Lansing as soon as
he reached the White House today. It
was understood the Lusitania case was
foremost among the subjects discussed.
