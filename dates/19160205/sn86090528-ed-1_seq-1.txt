Escaped from Prison

BY BIGGEST GUNS
Battls Raged for Nine Days and Nights;
Af.ackers Far Outnumbered Besieged;
No Grounls for Rumors of
Treason in Citadel
By WILLIAM PHILIP SIME.
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
PARIS, Jan. 11. (By Mail) The
mystery of the fall of Maubeuge has
at last hecn cleared up, after seven
teen months of rumors and doubts.
Instead of tho surrender of the
French fortress having been due to
treason, as intimated by German
sources, tha defense of the citadel is
said to have been one of the brilliant
actions of the war.
In an exclusive interview ..with a
French officer, a niembep-f the sta' t
of General Fcurnier, military gover
nor of Maubeuge, who has reached this
country after escaping from a German
prison, where he was sent with, the
other officers of the garrison, the
whole story in detail was made
known.
"Maubeuge was not another Metz,"
he said, "but a new Bell'ort. General
Fournier began fortifying the ap
proaches to the place on August 2,
working G.000 laborers with 23,00'H
territorials. They dug 3 miles of
trenches around the city, giiowing
great forethought, as at that time
trench fighting had not begun. They
strung one million square yards of
barbed wire on a million and halt
stakes and stationed fifty mobile bat
teries of artillery at strategic points,
as well as many dummy batteries to
fool the enemy.
"The city was invested towards the
end Of August by 65,000 Germans
against our 30,000 territorials. The
Germans were commanded by Genera!
von Zwhel in the presence of the
kaiser's nephew. Prince Leopold of
Prussia. For nine days a furious bat
tle raged, all the German heavy artil
lery bcit.g brought i:p from Liega
and Namur, including the 30s mi.'
meter and 420 militnetcr howitzers.
Ceaselessly shells raiued on the forts
day and night, causing a reign of ter
ror, for In addition to the city's resi
dents there were 40,000 refugees.
mostly women, children and old peo
ple from the north, quartered in the
town.
"The German shell fire was direct
ed by aeroplanes and spies who had
been on the job for years, living ia
Maubeuge and ostensibly engaged in
business there. One by one the futy
batteries were picked off. The arse
nal was fired by a German shell and
2,000 French shells exploded inside
at one time. People ail over the city
were knocked down by the force of
the explosion. The water, gas, elec
tricity, telephones and telegraph
were Instantly cut oft and the city,
including the hospitals, was burning.
"Out side the city, in the trenches,
the troops fought on without relief
as we were prevented from reaching
them by a curtain of artillury fire. We
made four sorties, once charging to
within 200 yards of the German mor
lart. "The citj', wrecked and on fire, our
ammunition exploded and means of
resistance dwindled, General Fournier
surendered on September . when th
Germans began hurling shells into th.;
ljuarter packed with refugees. To
fight on would have meant but one
thing: the slaughter of women and
babies.
"When tho Germans entered they
were astonished to find it defended
only by territorials. They believed
they were attacking a big garrison of
actives In recognition of the brave
