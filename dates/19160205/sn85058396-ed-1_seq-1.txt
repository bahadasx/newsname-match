VICTORIA BRIDGE
IS ENDANGERED
Montreal, Feb. 5. What is believed
to have been an attempt to blow up
the Victoria bridge was frustrated
last night by militia guards, it was
learned today.
About midnight the guards noticed
a man making his way toward the
bridge on tho Ice. He was picked out
by the searchlights and when chal
lenged retreated without answering.
About four o'clock a man was again
detected trying to reach the bridge
from tho ice. When he refused to
answer a challenge he was fired at,
but succeeded in making his escape.
An investigation started by tho mi
litia authorities has convinced them
that an attempt to destroy the bridge
was Intended.
The Victoria bridge crosses the St,
Lawrence and Is used by tho Grand
Trunk and the Delaware and Hudson
railways. It Is a mile and a half in
length and has been guarded by sol
diers since the outbreak of the war.
GERMANS OPPOSE
U: S, DEMANDS
Want to Know What America
Means by Again Raising
Question Involved in
Lusitania Affair. t
NATION MUST BE FIRM
Will Not Make Confession
That Proves "Slanders" on
' German Warfare Are
True.
Berlin, Feb. 5. Via London, 2:45 p.
m There are no new developments
here today in the Lusitania case, while
news is being awaited from Wash
ington. With regard to the propos
als of Secretary Lansing on the sub
ject of submarine warfare and the
arming of merchantmen, the Associat
ed Press is authoritatively informed
that they have not so far been sub
mitted to Germany.
The press continues to discuss tho
cabled report concerning those pro
posals of Mr. Lansing Tho Koel-njsche-
Volks Zeltung, an organ of the
Catholic party, says that the propos
als are absolutely inacceptable as
their acceptance would signify the
abandonment of the entire German
submarine enmpaign against the com
merce of the allies. With regard to
tho Lusitania question the Volks Zei
tung says that, if Mr. Wilson is cor
rectly reported as demanding that
Germany recognize that the sinking
of the Lusitania was illegal and un
justified by the theory of reprisals,
then there can be only one answer
a flat refusal.
What Does'America Mean?
Tho Kreuz Zeltung says it is neces
sary to emphasize the reasons which
should Influence Chancellor von Beth-mann-Hollweg
in deciding not to meet
the demands of the United States,
and adds:
"The chancellor will have to ask
cienly raising tne question of the gen
eral principle involved in the Lusi
tania affair and demanding that we
adopt a position completely at var
iance with the ono we took, clearly
and without ambiguity, six months
ago. He will have to decide whether
this action by America does not re
flect intentions which could not be
removed by concessions however
great on our part, but could be met
only by firm resolution.
"The chancellor will have to con
sider whether it would not make on
our allies, our enemies and neutrals
an impression of weakness by no
means justified by our successes and
military position to abandon our for
mer standpoint and make a confes
sion of having acted contrary to in
ternational law a confession which
would be used for all time to prove
the truth of the slanders which have
been heaped upon us.
"The chancellor In particular will
have to examine the question wheth
er if we should comply with tho new
American demands we would not
thereby allow our hands to be bound
in the struggle for existence by aban
doning a means of warfare which,
resting on the technical superiority,
might contribute substantially to
forcing our enemies to yield."
Limit to Concessions.
In conclusion the Kreuz Zeltung
sas:
"There cannot be the slightest
doubt that the government and people
clearly recognize the limits to our
concessions to America which are im
posed by military necessities and the
dignity of the German empire. Our
resolution that under n0 circumstan
ces shall these limits be overstepped
would not be -weakened even if the
course of events in the last eighteen
months had not brought on political
or military success after another and
bettered Germany's position in the
fatruggle against overwhelming odds."
The Germania, recalls the fact that
February 4th is the anniversary of
the Issuanco of the German proclama
tion establishing a war zone about
the British Isles. It says the most
important consequence was the de
struction of the Lusitania.
Critical Point Reached.
"This case, so far from being set
tled, has leached an especially crit
ical point." It continues. "We cannot
understand what moved America to
take her present step. It is most cer
tain that the sinking of tho Lusitania
was absolutely within the provisions
of the German proclamation and
therefore there can be no talk of il
legality unless our commercial war
round about Great Britain is to bo
deprived of its basis."
