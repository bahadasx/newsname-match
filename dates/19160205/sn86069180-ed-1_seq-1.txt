TRINITY CARNIVAL.
On last Sunday tllo Louisville
Courier-Journal commented on the
book Just issued by Jmes 1C Mc
Guire, former Mayor Af Syracuse,
entitled "what Germany uouia do
For Ireland," the wrltqr In tho local
paper not relishing thjo writings of
Mr. McGulro. Ho only commented
on the statement of Mr. McGulro
that Germany would taever quarrel
with tho United Statesjfor many and
varied reasons. But no mention was
made of tho author's statement that
Japan was our logical Opponent with
England as an ally. The book con
tains an able argument as to Ire
land's present feeling in tho Euro
pean war and predictsla brighter fu
ture for Ireland and its people in tho
event of the crushing pf Great Brit
ain. Tho book Is a sequel to Mr.
McGuIre'a other publication, "The
King, Tho Kaiser arid Irish Free
dom," and tho author bIiows himself
familiar with his subject and the
feelings of tho Irish, people. Ho
says:
"The people of Ireland have much
sympathy for Franco and Belgium.
They aro tho two countries that hold
some sections of the Irish people in
lino for England, but t,hero Is no lovo
lost for England in inost of tho
countries of Ireland. She cares
nothing about Servia, Russia or
Japan, and she always respected
Austria-Hungary and greatly ad
mired Germany before tho war. This
Is not Ireland's war, and the pity is
that any Irishman should have to
dlo to savo England. The British
control tho press of Ireland. Twelve
Irish Nationalist newspapers have
been suppressed, and of course it Is
thus very easy to malign tho German
race and mako people swallow falsi
ties. They recall the fact that Ger
many preserves the Irish language In
her colleges and that German schol
ars are among the most noted schol
ars In the language and history of
ancient Ireland. They recall that
somo years ago tho German fleet vis
ited Ireland and tho enjoyment of
tho crews who witnessea tho na
tional games. They aro reminded
that tho Hamburg-American Steam
ship Company proposed to have its
steamers stop at Cork after the Eng
lish discontinued stoppago of Eng
lish vessels at Queenstown, but the
British Government forced the Hamburg-American
line to abandon its
purpose."
Mr. McGulro also recalls the fact
that Germany has used Ireland's
coast for submarine warfare on Brit'
ish shipping and damaged England's
much vaunted reputation as mistress
of tho seas. Again ho says: "Eng
land's peril, it muBt not bo forgotten,
Is not so much invasion as starva
tion. Her people are mainly de
pendent upon Ireland, Denmark and
America for their food requirements.
England, enclosed between a hostile
Ireland and a hostile European pow
er, such as Germany, would be in a
position of grave peril as regards her
food supplies. Indisputably Ireland
Is tho gateway of Europe, but she Is
also the keystone of British power
and dominion on tho high seas of tho
world. When Ireland passes out of
English possesion tho sun will have
forever set on the British Empire.
England's view is that so long as Ire
land exists she must hold hor in sub
jection, to onablo her to maintain
her supremacy of the seas."
Regarding Belgium, the author
says: "Amorlcan students of history
are not carried away by the popular
feeling that England went to war to
savo tho llttlo state of Belgium. No
where In history has England fur
nished any precedent or such sacri
fice. Tho British Empire Is com
posed of small crushed nations whose
liberties were originally destroyed
by England. Tho peoplo of this
country do not readily forget that
our own freedom and independence
was won from England, and that we
owo less to her for our strength than
any country In Europe. History
teaches us that England always
finds a moral excuse for fighting her
nearest competitor for trade. Eng
land agreed to send 11C.000 troops
as an ally of Belgium, and tho small
army which sho sent to tho relief of
Belgium discredits her as the so
called champion of small nations.
"One thing seems certain at this
writing Germany will not lose the
war and will either triumph or force
a peace that will recast the map of
"Europe. Sho Is fighting everywhere
in the 'enemy's territory, always on
the offensive, occupying and living
off of 400,000 square miles of the
"best lands of her opponents. The
news of the unparalleled German
successes Is slowly filtering through
press-censored Ireland, so that even
the peasants now distrust all Eng
lish news, and scarcely a handful of
recruits can be obtained along the
west coast of Ireland." There la
much official uneasiness over the
escape of German prisoners from the
nltiUry prisons of Ireland, aided by
the growing numbers of German
sympathisers. Our friends la Ger-
Trlntty Council. Y. M. I., has com
pleted preparations for the "gym"

DAY FOR YOUTHS AND MAIDS
tho custom for the girls of pagan
Homo to write their names on slips
of paper, which were thrown into a
large urn In the market place, later
to bo drawn by the youtnB or tne
city. Each boy looked upon the
maid whose name 'ho drew as ms
sweetheart for tho time.
Innocent as thiq custom seems,
tho fact that it was1 of pagan origin
was enough to decide tho early
fathers of the church to decide that
It must go. Ono4of the most in
ventive of the hols men finally hit
upon the expedient of substituting
for the name of pie maids tho
names of martyrs and saints and by
this means put an end to tho objec
tionable custom at once.
This Is all that we really know
concerning tho origin of the day to
which the youths and maids of hun
dreds of years ago looked forward
as eagerly as we have every reason
to bellevo the youths and maidens
of hundreds of years to come will
'ook.
LARGELY ATTENDED.
LEGISLATURE

decision of tho Court of 'Appeals
Lm this matter was a just and
popular ono and tho General Assem

place whilo sho was returning to hor

February 14 will bo St. Valentine's
day, and therefore tho following
from tho Child Apostle will prove
Interesting to young and old:
"Who was good St. Valentine
and how did his feast day become
a day set apart for the sending of
lovo messages?" 1b a question that
bobs up yearly about February 14.
And yearly, despite tho fact that tho
day is so rich in fancy and legend,
tho same unsatisfactory answer Is
made; for no ono has over been
ablo to explain just how the llttlo
blind god Cupid camo to be mixed
up with tho celebration of tho feast
day of a martyred saint.
Old Valentino was a suro enough
saint, who wrote no poems nor love
songs and, so far as prying eyes and
ears have been ablo to find out,
never was a victim of tho llttlo fel
low's darts.
He was in fact a vonerablo
Bishop of Rome, who weathered the
fierce persecution of the monster
Emperor Claudius and won for him
self tho crown of martyidom In tho
year 270 A. D.
Immured, because of his defense
of his faith, In a dark and loath
some dungeon, ono person only in
all the world appears to have pitted
his miser'' and made an effort to
comfort his solitude. This was the
gentle blind daughter of his jailer,
who practiced tho faith in secret.
She it was, tradition tells us, who
stole dally to tho bars of the pris
oner's dungeon cell, to sing tho
sweet songs of faith and hopo that
strengthened his weary heart.
Her solf-sacrlfico and sweet sym
pathy did not go unrewarded, for In
thanksgiving tho gentle Bishop
healed her eyes, and tho maid, who
had been blind from her birth, saw
as others see.
Such a miracle should havo
moved tho stony-hearted judges of
the good saint, but It seems to havo
had tho opposlte effect upon them,
for a short tlmo afterward ho was
haled from his dungeon, clubbed
through the streets of Rome and
afterward beheaded.
So far back In tho world's history
goes the celebration of a feast day
of lovo that even the musty old
porers. over tho mud tablets of
ancient Babylon havo not been able
to got at the root of the matter. An
old belief prevailed at ono tlmo that
tho birds chose their mates on St.
Valentino's day; but whethor there
Is or is not a grain of truth in the
matter, it is qui to certain that hu
man sweethearts formerly used this
day to signify their devotion to each
other.
The custom of composing versea
appropriate to this day dates far
oacK maeea, anu we learn that a
certain tomo of 1440. tho work of
a monk of Bury, contained a ref
erence to St. Valentino's day. There
is a saying tnat one can not love
without giving. Perhaps this is
the reason why tho giving of gifts
has always been part of good St.
Valentine's day. Before the time
of manufactured valentines the
lovelorn swain or maid was com
pelled to make as best he or she
could a valentine for the dear one.

BARRY HEADS THE MOSE GREENS
JAMES J. MARTIN.
Tho death of James J, Martin at
tho noonday of his life caused wide
spread sorrow among tho printers
and his friends throughout tho city.
Mr. Martin was confined to his home
but a few weeks suffering from a
complication and grip and passed
away peacefully Monday morning.
Deceased had lived hero since child
hood, and by industry and persever
ance won the esteem and affection of
all with whom he associated. Gen
erous to church and charity, ho be
friended the widow and orphan and
had an open hand for good works.
Ho is survived by his widow and
three children, for whom there is felt
sincere sympathy. The funeral was
held Wednesday morning from St.
Columba's church, Rev. Father Kal
aher being tho celebrant of the high
mass of requiem. Mr. Martin was an
earnest supporter of this paper and
ono of its first subscribers.
ST. AUGUSTINE'S.
A turkey supper, euchre and
lotto under the auspices of Rev.
Father Felton, the pastor, and a
number of well known ladles will be
given next Thursday evening for
the benefit of St. Augustine's
church, Thirteenth and Broadway.
Games will bo played In the after
noon and after tho supper. This
affair will be given In St. Augus
tln'es Hall and promises to be a
pleasing entertainment. The Pro
ceeds will go to defray the frescoing
of the church, the work to be Aone
by T. A. Brocar, and the ereulon
of a Baldachian altar by the,Qris
antl Company. This congregation
is' noted for it excellent sifppers,
and this alone should assure a
large gathering. Father Fatten la

hie ehurch and build up a strong
congregation, an4 therefore d wervM
earnest support.
Tho sessions of the General As
sembly at Frankfort this past week
havo been enlivened oy some preuy
close contests In tho passage of
legislative measures, whilo charges
have been flying thick and fast. At
tlm bottom of all the disturbance
can be found tho prohibition agita-
tation fostered by a few political
preachers and down-and-outers bent
on getting oven with GoV. Stanley
and his administration.
It Is rumored that when Gov.
Stanley announced that he had
taken the pledge for tho four years
of his term as Governor he was the
recipient of congratulatory letters
from some of these preacher poli
ticians, who calculated on adding
to their political prestige by enroll
ing tho Governor on tho staff of
agitators and fanatics. Tho Gov
ernor renlied to their hypocritical
letters that If ho had taken that
step before election day they would
have howled that ne was maKing a
play to the galleries, in other words,
a grand stand play, and now that
these agitators, who were his bitter
enemies during tho campaign, had
tried to Ingratiate themselves into
the Governor's good graces, they
were making a grandstand play and
their hypocritical congratulations
wero not appreciated.
It is pleasing to note that tho
medloval bill introduced by ono
E. D. Stone, Representative from
Crittenden and Livingston counties,
was not even brought to tho atten
tion of tho Lower House, being re
ported adversely by tho commltteo
to whom it wac referred. Stone's
measure was tho famous convent In
spection bill, and is fathered in
every State Legislature by tho Men
ace, tho mud gutter Journal of tho
A. P. Apes. Another bill deserving
of no consideration is ono Intro
duced by Representative W. M.
Webb, the Palntsvlllo Republican
Representative, who wishes to have
tho fourth Friday In October set
aside as "temperance day" in tho
schools and tho.teachers and school
superintendents arrange a pro
gramme showing tho evils or alco
holic drinks, the effects of cigar
ettes, etc. Representative Webb
ought to have included that each
school should bo compelled to enact
that stirring drama, "Ten Nights In
a Bar-room," and that a prlzo bo
given for tho best essay on the lives
of Dr. Palmer and Percy Haly,
those two sterling prohibition lead
ers. Much surprise was manifested
hero by tho bill Introduced In tho
Houso and Senate this week by
Representative Spahn and Senator
Robertson, which would glvo per
mission, if enacted, to tho County
Magistrates to establish offices In
Louisville, despite the fact that the
Court of Appeals only recently
ruled that a Magistrate's jurisdic
tion should be confined to his own
district. This to the mind of
layman is evidently fair and it
would be tho rankest injustice to
allow a Magistrate elected In the
county to establish himself in tho
city at the expense of the City
Magistrate or vice versa. It Is not
Democratic and Is not only unfair
to the Magistrate, but unfair to the
voters pf a district In which the
County .Magistrate was elected, to
come and injure tho Interests and
business of the Magistrate who was
chosen by the people of that dis
trict. For the good of the Demo
eartle party which they represent
The Louisville Tlme3 recently in
vited information from Its readers
as to who possessed tho best record
for regular attendance at Sunday
school, and offered a Bible as a
prlzo to the winner. From differ
ent parts of Kentucky came letters
from members of Baptist and Meth
odist churches principally, all
proudly prating that he or she was
the prize winner In tho congrega
tion, and the highest averago of
these ranging from ton to twelve
years. But It remained for Law
rence J. Smith, of this city, to come
forward with a record which made
them all sit up and tako notice, his
letter to the Times being as follows:
"My record Is as follows: I am
sixty-eight years old, and have gone
to church every Sunday and holy day
of obligation since I was four years
old. I missed one Sunday while at
sea when I was on my way to Nova
8cotia. That was over sixteen years
ago. I am a member of St. Louis
Bertrand's Catholic church, Sixth
ntreet, between St. CatherliT6""and
Oak, and never miss mass on Sunday.
If I am late for ono mass I go to the
next one."
Mr. Smith Is a Ufe-long employe
of the Chess & Wymond Company,
where ho Is loved and respected by
both employers and fellow-employes.
He Is also a member of tho Holy
Name 'Society of St. Louis Ber
trand's church and Is a faithful at
tendant with that society on their
regular communion Sunday.
INTO HEAVENLY REST.
A beautiful life was brought to a
close early last Saturday morning
when the Lord called Miss Mary
Lawrence Bax. daughter of L. D.
Bax, to hor well earned reward. Her
death affected not only those nearest
to her by ties of relationship and
friendship, but all who ever met
and talked to her. In her was ex
emplified a true Christian life. Tho
character of this noble girl was of
exceptionally fine caliber and she
was ever ready to rejoice or sym
pathize with all who camo in con
tact with her. In the home, whero
she was a source of pleasure and
contentment by her cheerful dispo
sition, sho will bo deeply mourned.
Miss Bax was stricken two weeks
before with pneumonia, and sho
died peacefully and gently, as sho
had always lived. She was born In
Loulsvlllo twenty-ono years ago. and
as a child began her studies at St.
John's school. Later she attended
Presentation Academy, whero sho
was graduated In 1010. All hor
life she had been a member of St.
John's church, Clay and Walnut
streets, and had a host of friends
In the parish. Besides her father
sho is survived by hor mother; a
sister, Miss Anna Virginia Bax, and
four brothers, William, Bernard,
waiter ana L. D. Bax, Jr., all of
this city. Tho funeral was hold
Monday morning, Rov. Dr. Schuh
mann being tho celebrant of tho sol
emn high mass of requlom. May her
soui navo eternal rest.
DAYLIGHT MEETING.
The daylight meeting of Divis
ion 3, A. O. H at tho Hibernian
Home on Portland avenue Sunday
afternoon, was the occasion for a
largo turnout. President Lawrenco
Mackoy occupied tho chair and kept
everything moving, tho result being
that tho proceedings wero full of
Interest. Tho reports of the various
committees wero satisfactory, tho
recent entertainments bslng very
successful. Division 3 Is constantly
receiving accessions of young men
into its ranks, who are working
earnestly with tho older members to
wipe out the remaining indebted
ness on their now home, tho only
one owned by tho order in this sec
tion of the country.
CALLED TO REWARD.
I and not to add to the feeling at
present against some of our flsoal Bw nephews.
The Rev. Father Maurice Wagner,
of Marlah Hill, Ind died at an
Evansvllle infirmary after an opera
tion Sunday afternoon. He had
resided at Marlah Hill thirty-three
years and was nearly seventy years

In the recently published eighth
volume of the Historical Records
and Studies of the United States
Catholic Historical Solcety a chapter
is devoted to an outline of "Mission
Work Among Colored CatholiCB."
And Incidentally tho story is told of
a noble negro, the perusal of whoso
life and work would bo tho sourco
of elevation and good to any man
of any race or creed. Tho story Is
that of Pierre Toussalnt, who camo
as a slave from Santo Domingo with
his master and tho master's wife,
fleeing from tho revolution of Aug
ust, 1791. Tho master died on a
return trip to the Island, and tho
widow "found herself in her new
homo without any resources."
"Toussalnt," wo learn, "imme
diately devoted himself to her main
tenance. Ho was an expert ladles'
hair dresser and soon becamo the
fashionable artist of the town, earn
ing a considerable amount, which ho
expended on his mistress, who on
her death bed In 1810 emancipated
him." But he also found tlmo oven
then "to do a great deal of charltablo
work, helping tho poor with his sav
ings and ministering to tho sick.

his work was heroic. When ho be
camo freo his prosperity increased
and his thrift accumulated a modest
competence, tho Incomo of which
went to tho poor, for churches, to
orphan asylums, or whatever fos
tered tho progress of religion. He
lived to tho ago of eighty-seven,
dying on June 30, 1853. It Is stated
that for sixty years ho never failed
to hear mass every morning."

he performed unappreciated. At his'"
death there wore many to testify to
his good works. A lady, a non-
Catholic, who had attended his
funeral in Now York thus describes
It in a letter to a friend: "I went on
Saturday to attend Toussaint's fu
neral. High mass, Incense, candles,
rich robes, sad and solem music
wero there. Tho church gave all that
It could give to prince or noblo. Tho
priest, his friend Mr. Quln, made a
most Interesting address. Ho did
not alludo to his color and scarcely
to Ills' station; it soemed as if his
virtues as a man and a Christian had
absorbed all other thoughts. A
stranger would not havo suspected
that a black man of his humblo call
ing lay in tho midst of us. Ho said
no relative was loft to mourn for
him, yet many present would feel
that they had lost ono who always
had wise counsel for the rich, words
of encouragement for the poor, and
all would bo grateful for having
known him. Tho aid ho had given
to tho late Bishop Fonwlck, of Bos
ton, to Father Power, of our city, to
all tho Catholic institutions, was
dwelt upon at largo. How much I
havo learned of his charltablo deeds
which I had never known boforel
Mr. Quln said: 'There were left few
among tho clergy superior to him In
devotion and zeal for the church
and for the glory of God; among
laymen none!' "
A remarkable and beautiful story
Indeed, this life of tho ex-slave
Toussalnt. "God's imago carved in
ebony," has ho been called by an
other lady "who wrote an account of
his careor. And this is but ono in
stance of tho beneficial influence of
tho Catholic church upon members
of tho negro race. Tho church, tho
first to take up tho work for the
negro in this country, has always
been tho sourco of elevation for these
people. Hatred of tho church and
of tho negro has often In fact gone
hand In hand. It was so In the case
of tho "New York conspiracy," or
tho "negro plot," In which a number
ot Catholic negroes wero burned at
tho stake In 1741. Ono of these, of
whom wo read, Juan do Sylva, as he
went to his death, "kissed a crucifix,
Insisting on his innocenco to the
last."
Tho negro In our country at the
preesnt tlmo Is in great need of the
church's helping Lund. In the negro
missions can bo producod other char
acters of the samo nobility as Pierre
Toussalnt and Juan do Sylva. In
this way is not alone a religious
work but likewise a social work per
formed. It is incumbent on Catholics
to reallzo tho Importance of this
matter and to contribute generously
to tho support of the missions
among tho negro people in this coun
try. Too often, wo aro Inclined to
believe, do they fall to understand
tho vital necessity of this form ot
missionary endeavor.
