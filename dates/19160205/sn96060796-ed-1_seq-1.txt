Because he could not secure an
office id Oatuian, a Denver man
bought ground and is erecting a
$15,000 building, in which he
will provide himself an office as
well as offices for others.
With the signing of a joint
agreement yesterday between R.
Li, Slaughter, for the Slaughter
Land & Cattle company. George
Woodward and the Bank of
Bisbee, the litigation in the
Sonora ranch case is believed by
all parties concerned to have
been ended aud a compromise
effected, which is satisfactory to
those concerned.
Mrs. Jones, whose husband
had just purchased a machine,
stepped to the window one day,
upon hearing an auto go by and
saw Mr. Jones in his new car
race madly by. In a short time
he passed again. The third time
he called: "Maggie, phone the
garage and find out " He pass
ed out of sight. Soon he passed
again." How to stop this thing
and tell me the next time I pass."
W. H Barnett and J. B. David,
who are doing work at the Hap
py Jack, say the vein is widen
ing with the first few feet of
work. The tunnel is in 470 feet,
and the present vein may be a
feeder of the Clipper vein, which
the tunnel is expected to cut.
Messrs. Barnett and David were
handicapped in getting their
camp established, owing to the
recent big snows. Patagonian.
The unprecedented demand for
copper from foreign and domes
tic sources resulted in the ad
vance of the quotation from 2i$
cents to 25i cents foi deli very
during the second quarter of the
year. The price of 27 cents is
reported offered- for March de
livery. It is rumored that 30
cents was bid for February de
livery, but this is unconfirmed.
These prices are the highest
since March, 1907.
Reports submitted by Forest
officers in the charge of the Na
tional Forests of Arizona show
a total of 1063 deer, 562 turkeys',
34 bear, 104 coyotes, 44 wolves
and 402 lions as killed by hunt
ers during the season of 1915.
These reports do not pretend to
be mathematically accurate, but
are careful estimates based on
close observations by the Forest
Ranger, and give a good general
index to hunting conditions.
Work at the old Hosey prop
erty in the Santa Ritas, which
is being done a short distance
from the old shaft, is uncovering
some fine ore. The Hosey is
looked upon as one of the finest
properties in the entire district,
and it is no surprise to the well
informed that new wrork is mak
ing such a good showing. Sev
eral years ago many carloads of
high-grade copper were shipped
from the Hosey, formerly known
as the August. The latest ore
find is from a w.;nze down about
40 feet in the tunnel.
i Charles Russell and a party of
fellow travellers who have been
making an effort to navigate the
Colorado river through the
Grand Canyon in a number of
small boats have abandoned the
attempt after having suffered
numerous losses of boats and pa-"
faphejmalAa,, including cameras,
nd films''' with Which they ex--pected
to get a great collection
of pictures. The last misfortune
was the lodging of one of their'
boats against a rock under the
water, which required five days
to release. Mineral Wealth.
An unusual feature of the big
storm last week was the surpris
ingly large number of trees
which were felled on account of
the great weight of the snows.
In the Santa Rita mountains
prospectors report great num
bers of stately pines having been
crushed and broken, while team
sters on the Duquesne haul were
kept busy cutting the broken
trees out of the road to permit
passage of freight. Thousands
of trees in the Santa Rita and
Patagonia mountains are broken
close to the ground as a result
of the big snowstorm. Patagonian.
"Let us adopt as our slogan:
'Arizona for Arizonans.' Let us
not be hyphenated Arizonans,"
urged Mis. Henry D. Ross, pres
ident of the Arizona Federation
of Women's Clubs, in her address
at the opening of the fourteenth
annual meeting at the Woman's
Clubs at Tucson. "Let us cease
dreaming about the state we
came from, or speculating on the
state to winch we hope to go,
and be loyal to the state where
we now live. In living up to our
slogan let us sue that we abolish
catalog buying, support home in
dustries and institutions study
the history of the state, preserve
our prehistoric ruins, awaken in
terest in our natural wonders,
encourage higher ideals in our
citizenship and educate our rural
communities to a better standard
of living. "
SI3NING PETITIONS.
The following clipping from
me v i. u
s iows h
the mfjt
the Yvuhita (h.ansasj limes,
w easy it is to get even
t ridiculous petition
ined :
"Men are quick to sign peti
tions. It costs them nothing,
and by signing they avoid mak
ing enemies and perhaps gain a
lriend. More often than not,
they do not even read the peti
tions they are asked to sign.
To pro 5tb this assertion and to
win a bet, an Abilene, Kansas,
man recently drew up and circu
lated a petition to the governor
of Kansas "to have the road to
Tipperary shortened." He got
over 200 signatures to that pe
tition, and among the number
was the mayor of the city, a
bank cashier and many other
leading citizens, to say nothing
of a district judge. It is need
less to add that he won the bet."
SAVED HiS LIFE.
It is probable that no class of
men is lampooned more unjustly
than doctors. Many of the stories
at their expense, however, are
both amusing and good-natured.
A recent addition to the list is the
tale told by Tits-Bits about the
Chinaman who was asked if
there were good doctors in China.
"Good docta!" he exclaimed.
"China have best docta in
world. Hang Chang one good
docta he. great; he saved my life.
"You don't say so! How was
that?"
"Me velly bad," he said. Me
callee Doctor Han Kon. Give
some medicine. Get velly, velly
ill. Me callee Doctor San Sing,
Give some more medicine. Me
grow worse going to die. Blime
by callee Doctor Hang Chang.
He got no time; no come. Save
my life.
