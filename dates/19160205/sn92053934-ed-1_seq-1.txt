FEDERALRESERVE
BOARDEXPRESSES
REGEET AT ACTION
Washington, Feb. 5 The federal
reserve board issued a statement to
day expressing its regret at the dis
position evidenced in some states to
draw a line of distinction and cleavage
between state and national banks
which are members of the federal re
serve system.
It has taken form, the statement
says, by efforts in some states to
separate existing bankers societies in
trv spnflratp nrffanizations: one for
tween state and national government
which might produce a tendency to
legislate downward as to banking
standards or create conditions of un
certainty rather than safety, for the
'mere purpose of making one system
! more attractive from the profit making
to join the reserve system and said
that it has gone the limit to keep in
tact the powers of the state banks
joining that system.

the expense of sending troops to the

Negotiations Hold Position
Assumed Weeks Ago
Gravity Potential.
Washington, Feb. 5. President Wil
son and Secretary Lansing will not
begin discussion of Germany's latest
answer in the Lusitania negotiations
before Monday.
It was said that the president al
ready has the proposal from Berlin
before him and wants to go over it
carefully before he begins conferences
t, .u f if .
with the secretary of state. It was
. x o x . u ' -o (
pointed out that the situation was not
one which called for haste.
Officials reiterated their statement ;
that the situation was unchanged. !
There was an undertone of expecta
tion that the two governments would
be able to find common . ground for
agreement, in official declarations that
Berlin's reply has not made the situ
ation any more serious.
Washington, Feb. 5. The Lusitania
case again today was in the forefront
of the international problems occupy
ing the serious attention of the Wash
ington government.
President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing went over a new proposal
presented last night by Count Bern
storff. the German ambassador. Until
they have decided there will be no
change in the virtual deadlock to
which negotiations came weeks ago
and perhaps not them. Officials were
emphatic in declaring that whatever
gravity there was in the situation was
potential.
Apparently the stumbling block of
the situation is the word "illegal," as
differently interpreted in this country
and Germany. The Berlin govern
ment's answer proposes instead of a
flat admission of illegality of the meth
od of submarine warfare in sinking
the liner, the acceptance" of liability
for the loss of neutral lives, which
Germany hopes will satisfy the United
States and still not bind Germany
from continuing the submarine cam
paign. Secretary Lansing will confer with
President Wilson today over the new
tentative form of settlement of the
Lusitania case, submitted yesterday
by Count von Bernstorff. the German
ambassador. Meanwhile Mr. Lansing
reiterated the situation is unchanged.
The state department does not con
sider that the general situation sur
rounding the negotiations, which are
described as confidential and in
formal, is any more grave than it has
been.
Administration officials carefully re
frained from expressing any opinion
on the acceptability or non-acceptability
of the newest proposal. They
pointed out that it could not be said
there was a deadlock, because nego
tiations still were under way.
Berlin Awaits Jfews.
Berlin, via London, Feb. 5. There
are no new developments here today in
the Lusitania case, while news is be
ing awaited from Washington. With
regard to the proposals of Secretary
Lansing on the submarine warfare and
the arming of merchant men, the As
sociated Press is- authoritatively in
formed that they have not so far been
submitted to Germany.
The press continues to discuss the
cabled reports regarding these pro
posals of Mr. Lansing. The Koelnische
Volks Zeitung, an organ of the Catho
lic party, says that the proposals are
absolutely inacceptable as their ac
ceptance would signify the abandon
ment of the entire German submarine
campaign against the commerce of the
allies. The paper says that if Mr. Wil
son is correctly reported as demanding
that Germany recognize -hat the sink
ing of the Lusitania was illegal and
unjustified by the theory of reprisals,
then there can be only one answer a
flat refusal.
Tension lessening.
The tension created by the latest de
velopments in the Lusitania case evi
dently is lessening. Most of the aft
ernoon papers do not discuss the situ
ation today. The Kreuz Zeitung, how
ever, says it is necessary to emphasize

Los Angeles, Feb. 5. The condition
of George M. Reynolds, the Chicago
banker, who is seriously ill at a hotel
here, remained unchanged today.
Man Flees at
Challenge of
Post Guards
Montreal, Feb. 5. What is believed
to have been an attempt to blow up
the Victoria bridge was frustrated last
night by militia guards, it was learned
today. Guards noticed a man making
his way toward the bridge on the Ice,
and when he refused to answer a chal
lenge, he was fired at but succeeded in
escaping. The Investigation started
by the militia authorities has con
vinced them that an attempt to destroy
the bridge was intended.
The Victoria bridge crosses the St.
Lawrence and is used by railways. It
is a mile and a j.lt In length and has
been guarded by soldiers since the
war.

THE WAR TODAY
Heavy artillery play continues,1
in France and Belgium but neither
here nor in any I the other Impor
tant theatres of operations have
there been infantry movements re
sulting in exchanges of territory.
Constantinople declares that the
British, attempting to advance
from Felahle, were repulsed by a
Turkish counter attack and com
pelled to fall back to their former
positions.
In Albania the Bulgarians are
reported to have fallen back to
ward the Drin river, near the east
ern frontier. The occupation of
strategical points by the forces of
Essad Pasha and by Serbian troops
who have re-formed at Durazzo Is
believed in Athens to make a new
Bulgarian expedition toward the
coast difficult.
The advance of the Austrians
down the Albanian coast coutiiuies,
the latest advices apparently indi
cating that they were some twenty
miles northeast of Durazzo.
The latest reply of Germany to
the demands of the United States
regarding the sinking of the Lusi
tania is being considered today by
President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing. The demands of the Uni
ted States have not yet been satis
factorily complied with, Germany
halting at declaring the sinking
of the ship "illegal" believing thut
such an admission would apply to
her entire submarine campaign.
The allies and the Germans are
hurling big shells at each other
from Belgium to the Yosges moun
tains. On the Russian and Gallcian
fronts comparative quiet prevails.
Artillery lighting along the Aus-tro-Italian
front is in progress
and the Auvtrians continue to ad
vance into Albania with Durazzo
their immediate objective.
The British report that the
French have captured additional
German forces In West Africa.
Berlin, in an official report says
that Zeppelin L-19 has not return
ed from a reconnoitering flight
and that inquiries concerning the
airship hare been without result.
A report from Berlin via Copen
hagen says Emperor William has
been on the western front for
some time and was near the Bel
gian frontier when the recent at
tacks on Loos took place. The re
port also says the emperor, Ad

MOHR TRIAL
ENDED; CASE
GOESTOJURY
Rhode Island Woman's Fate
Resting in the Hands
of the Jurors.
INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN
Judge Advises Men of Duty
Is Charged With Mur
der of Husband.
Providence, R. L, Feb. 5r At
2:45 o'clock this afternoon no
word had come from the jury, "
which at that time had been con
sidering the case for fonr hours.
Providence, R. I.. Feb. 5. The case
of -Mrs. Elizabeth F. Mohr, Cecil
Brown and Henry H. Spellman,
charged with the murder of Dr. C.
Franklin Mohr, the woman's husband,
was given to the Jury at 10:45 o'clock
today.
Judge Stearns in his charge to the
jury declared that it was their duty,
if they concluded the state had proved
its case, to say "guilty" whatever the
consequences in each case, or in any
case.
I "The law recognizes no color, no
i o... " tho nmirf- nnJH "PftV tin TA-
gard to the fact that one defendant Is
a woman and two are negroes. They
are three citizens on trial, and I
charge you not to allow any prejudice
or feeling, except an honest desire to
do impartial justice, to enter your
minds."
"The law In regarctwprlnclpals la
a crime," the court explained, "la
this : Where any persons are present,
aiding and abetting in the actual com
mission of a crime in this case It is
murder they are equally guilty with
those who actually commit the crime.
Mrs. Mohr has been indicted as an ac
cessory before the fact. If you find
she hired, aided, procured or assisted
one or the other of the defendants, she
is guilty." .
Judge Stearns asserted that under
the law an accessory cannot be con
victed unless one or both of the prin
cipals is found guilty and therefore
that it was logical that the Jury first
determine whether Brown and Spell
man were guilty.
Attacks Healis Testimony.
Discussing the testimony of George
W. Healis, Dr. Mohr's chauffeur, who
turned state's evidence, the court said,
the reliance to be placed on his story
rested with the Jurors. "Healis is a
puzzling figure In this case," said the
judge. "It's a fair question how much
of his statement is true and how much
Is false."
The court said no confession was
made by Mrs. Mohr, but that, accord
ing to the state, she had made threats,
against her husband. It was for the.
jury to determine the value of these ,
alleged threats.
Inasmuch as confessions are only to
be taken as against the persons mak
ing them, it was also pointed out, the
alleged confessions of Brown and
Spellman were not to be considered as
against Mrs. Mohr.
Iowa Posse Is Foiled.
Clarinda, Iowa, Feb. 5. Posses
which were searching the woods of
Page county for the robbers who ear

drawn today. No trace of the robbers
had been found and it is believed they
escaped over the Nebraska or Missouri
state line.
