WILL RECLAIM LAND
Commercial Club of Macon is
Planning Drainage Cam
paign in that Section.
TO GALL A CONVENTION SOON
Means of Saving Valuable Farms In
That Section From Overflow
Will Be Discussed.
The Macon Commercial club is
working out plans for a land congress
to be hold there soon. Henry Funk,
land owner In tho Salt River Valley,
Shelby county, was the originator of
the move. Tho purpose is to start a
campaign for the reclamation of all
tho overflow lands in Northeastern
Missouri.
Tho last census showed a falling
off In tho population of mnny coun
ties in Northeastern Missouri. This
has aroused public spirited citizens
to an investigation of the causes and
to tho working out of plans which
will recoup tho counties for their loss
and bring moro citizens in. Tho land
congress is the first tangible move in
a campaign to Increase the population
of tho First district of Missouri by
100,000 or more.
Thousands ot acres ot young corn
wero destroyed by high waters in tho
valleys last year. In some portions
of tho Salt river and tho Charlton
valleys there wero drainage systems,
but in most cases they wero Inade
quate to tako care of the floods of
1915. It has been figured that the
loss on corn alone would como close
te paying for improvements which
would mako these vast areas of fer
tile land absolutely safe.
"There are sections far inferior to
Northeastern Missouri which havo
gone ahead and done great things slmi
ply because the peoplo4 havo deter
mined that they would overcome nat
ural obstacles and bring bounty to the
land where thero had been poverty,"
said Mr. Funk.
. Tho land congress will bo a conven
tion of land owners, farmers, good
roads men and people who in any way
aro interested in tho soil. Among tho
Bpeakcrs will bo a representative of
the public service commission, a man
from the department of agriculture
at tho state university, a .number of
well known financial men who are In
terested in land Improvement and a
speaker on "The Personal Develop
ment of Rural Communities."

TO BUILD NEW BRANCH LINES
The Burlington Is Planning to Run a
Road From Monroe to Mo
berly Other Changes.
The Burlington railroad in 1916 is
expected to maturo extensive plans
for bettering its Bervlc'e in Missouri
by building new lines nnd possibly by
forming new alliances with other rail
roads for shortening tlmo and distance
between St. Louts and Kansas City.
Somo of the proposed changes havo
been under consideration by the Bur
lington management for several years,
but their execution was delayed by
tho depression In general business,
which adversely affected railroad earn
ings. With a revival of business the
company will take up', the projects
temporarily abandoned.
High officials of tho Burlington
havo Just inspected a right of way
which had been surveyed between
Moberly and Monroe City, Mo., and it
is stated work may bo begun soon on
a lino of track connecting these two
cities. A line has also been surveyed
from Mexico to Moberly and will bo
built at tho same time. From Mo
berly the Burlington will become a
tenant of the Wabash railroad to Kan
sas City, if it is possible to mako
satisfactory arrangements to that end.
In the event of failure to make
satisfactory traffic arrangements with
tho Wabash for getting its trains from
Moberly to Kansas City, the Burling
ton, it is stated, will carry out a more
pretentious plan of construction. This
is to build a lino of Its own from Mo
berly througli lo Liberty, Mo. At Lib
erty it would strike tho rails ot its
main line over which, the balance of
tho distance to Kansas City would be
covered.
THREE STOCKMEN '.MISSING
The Dobbins Brothers, of plater Have
Mysteriously Disappeared Many
Debts Left Behind-
Tho Dobbins Brothers,-'Allen, John
and Richard, among the; most exten
sive feeders and' shippers of cattle in
Saline county, left SI jit or together af
ter disposing of everything dispos
able, including mortgaged property,
and have not been heard from since.
They left behind an- array of liabili
ties estimated on the s.treet at from
$25,000 to $50,000. No one' really
knows whnt their debts amount to,
unless It is the banks, as the heaviest
sufferers are not talking.
Among the heaviest losers aro Kan
sas City and St. Louis live stock .com
mission houses, which held mortgages
on their cattle. Byers Brothers & Co.
did most of the Dobblnscs' business in
Kansas City, and tho Shippers' Llvo
Stock Commission Company in St.
Louis. Various banks aro also reputed
to hold cattle mortgages, but tho
losses to the banks aro well distrib
uted. The disappearance of the three
brothers has created all the stir that
the failure ot reputedly solid and sub
stantial citizens always ' does. The
soundness of tho brothers was never
questioned. The oldest, Allen, is
about 35; the youngest,. Richard,
about 28. Tbey were reared In th6
county, know overyono and were
known by everyone. They were hard
workers and apparently keen Judges
of cattle,
They aro accused of having bought
on ono market, incumbered the stock,
shipped it to their farms at Slater for
a few weeks and then sold It on the
other market, representing it to be
clear of incumbrance.

A suit to havo tho will ot Charles
C. Stlfcl construed has been filed at
St. Louis by tho trustees and by Otto

and prosperous of occupations aro

tho physical strength and tho high
type ot manliness that was theirs In
the days when they hewed their homes
out of the virgin forest, and made

When the builder of tho western Ca
nadian pralrlo looks upon tho result of
his work, why shouldn't his chest ex
pand? It was probably somo of this
feeling of pride that took possession
of Sir Donald Mann, vice president ot
tho Canadian Northern Railway tho
other day In Winnipeg, when he said:
"I am not In tho habit of giving ad
vice, but I havo no hesitation of advis
ing tho young men of Canada, every
young man, to get out and get a piece
of western Canada's land that now
can bo had for the asking and be their
own masters."
"It was 36 years ago when I first
camo to Winnipeg," he Bald. "At that
tlmo thero were lcs3 than 150,000
people wcRt of Lako Huron in Canada,
and tho only bit of railway in opera
tion was between St. Boniface and Em
ersonabout sixty miles. Today there
aro nearly 20,000 miles of railway In
actual operation and tho population Is
over two and a quarter million, a won
derful achievement in such a short pe
riod you will agree, when you havo
contemplated it a moment."
"At that time all tho flour, meat nnd
many othor supplies for our contracts
wero brought from tho States. Now
consider what the west is doing to
day. You havo a grain production ex
ceeding n billion bushels and yet only
a comparatively small area of the till
able land of the country is occupied.
Five years hence you will be moro
than doubling that." AdvcrtiscmenL
