It was said In high olflclal quarters
that some announcement might be
made within the next few days.
The impression here is that president
Wilson ia the only one who knows
what shall be the attitude of the
United States. Even secretary Lansing
is not believed to have a definite idea
what turn affairs may take
Tho one word "illeKal" as differently
interpreted in uie umieu otai auu ,
Germany protrudes out of the tentative,
Interpreted in the United States and
draft of the Lusitania agreement, per
fected by ambassador von Bernstorff
and secretary Lansing, as the stumbling
block which has caused Berlin to refer
to the negotiations as having reached a
crisis and Washington to characterize
the situation as grave.
Would Not Tie Up Whole f'ampaiKn.
Germany's answer, presented to sec
retary of state Lansing by count von
Bernstorff, proposes instead of an out
and out admission of illegality in the
method of submarine warfare used by
the German naval authorities in sink
ing the liner, an acceptance of liability
for the loss of neutral lives which Ber
lin hopes will satisfy the United States
and still will not bind Germany from
continuing the submarine campaign.
German officials believe that their
previous promise to discontinue sink
ing unresisting merchantmen without
uarning brings the submarine cam
paign within the pale of International
law and that any Inclusion of that
phase In the Lusitania argument is un
necessary and humiliating to the im
perial governmpnt
"Won! I Stumbling lllnek.
The word "illegal" in the draft the
German ambassador transmitted to his
government as meeting all the conten
tions of the United States, is taken to
have been regarded in Berlin as being
susceptible of application not to the
Lusitania case alone, but to the 'entire
submarine campaign.
That Is the only explanation which
officials here can find for the statement
of Dr. Zimmerman, under secretary of
'orelm affairs, that "the United States
suddenly made new demands which it is
Impossible for us to accept "
Secretary of state Lansing declared
thnt the, TinfdHnn nf the United States
was unchanged and the German am -
bassador knew or no new demand
which were embodied in the proposal
he sent to Berlin
Germany Substitute One lhrne.
It Is known thnt the only change the
Berlin foreign office has made in the
agreement drawn by the secretary and
tho ambassador. Is to substitute for the
word "illegal" a phrase which, while
BSBnmlntr li-,Klllti- for th Ilve of
neutrnln nat nt. th T.iisltnnln does not
admit of construction into prohibition '
of submarine warfare. The dispatch
the ambassador received and presented
to the secretary was very brier and
covered only that one point.
No More. No I.e Grnr.
After tho ambassador's visit to the
state department today, secretary Lan
sing declared "the situation ia un
changed." That may bo authoritatively stated
to represent the situation accurately
It has become no more grave, and by
that fact he has become no less grave.
Its status has not materially changed
and it may re'maln so four or five days
at least while president Wilson and
secretary Lansing consider Germany's
answer fully. In a like manner, it
may lje stated authoritatively that it
does not follow that either a com
pletely satisfactory answer or an open
break must follow at the end of that
time. Tho negotiations may continue.
Dlftllke Intimation From nerlln.
President Wilson is not Insensible
that public opinion in Germany as else
