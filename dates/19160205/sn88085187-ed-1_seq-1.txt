iiai k many of the men who
• were laid off early last year.
The increase will affect 4. r>o

to work 00 or more men who
have been under lay-offs.
Practically all of tlie men are
, heads of families.
Tlie locomotive department in
cludes machinists, mechanic..,
blacksmiths and boilcrinnkers.
Watch Payroll Swell.
For nearly a year the N P.
shops have run with a force ot
.employes below normal. Prac
tically all of the workmen em
ployed only worked eight hours
a day, five days a week.
Beginning today, however, the
.50 men in the locomotive works
resume a nine-hour, six-day
week, with a possibility of over
time.
The old workmen will be taken
" back Monday.
Supt. P. \V. Malott of the N.

announcing that no outside work
men would be taken on.
He was anxious that it be ex
plained clearly that only former
employes, who had been laid off,
were being taken back for the
• present.
To Be Permanent.
"If the wrong impression gets
out, we will be besieged with men
seeking work," expluined the
superintendent.
"And in fairness to the unem
ployed, 1 hope that a proper
statement is made of the sttua

The resumption of full time at
tho Northern Pacific shops is
due to an increase of traffic, ac
cording to N. P. oflcials.
The change is to be permanent
so far as they know.

Don't Let Foxy Boys Use Bad
Rule to Get Control of New
1 Cub; Instead, Amend the Rule
Consider what happened last night at the meeting of the taxation and
legislation bureau of the New Commercial club.
It was mighty significant. It showed up a fault in the re organization
scheme which must be remedied before another election takes place, if the
club is to retain the magnificent public goodwill it now possesses.
This meeting saw arise the familiar old issue of clique rule vs. democracy.
It disclosed the old gang that ran the old club, to the detriment of the
community, trying to get back into the saddlle.
* • • #
The Timet is giving the matter this great prominence today simply be
cause we believe in the re-organized club and want to see it succeed.
We fought the old club when it did thing! for the benefit of the few as
against the interests of the many. The old club collapsed finally like a dis
eased old man. Now has arisen the magnificent new organization. We spook
this word of warning as friend to friend. W this new club shapes a sane
course, playi fair, works for Tacoma first, lasi and all the time, and tries hon
estly to represent the whole community, it will be a mighty force in city up
building, We firmly believe it will do all this.
If, on tlie other hand, it permits itself to be made a tool of the selfish, it
will fall with a quicker, more resounding crash than the old one, That would
be nothing less than a calamity.
* # * #
Bill to get back to what happened last night.
The legislation and taxation bureau met, as did the other bureaus, to nom
inate six members for club directors, the names to go on the club ballot Tues
day. Three of the six will be elected.
This is the bureau, you understand, which in the future will act on mat
ters of taxation and legislation. Hero are some of the men who were much in
evidence and were very active in the meeting: J. T. S. Lyle. attorney and lit
tle brother to the rich; Jimmy Davis, machine legislator; Jimmy Gallagher,
machine politician; Guy E. Kelly, machine politician and legislator; Herbert
Hunt, Perkins editor; James Cameron, county assessor, and a whole host of
the same kind. They and their friends comprised perhaps half or a third of
the members present.
Mow, of course, these men have paid their dues and had a perfect right
to be there and to vote and to do everything they did do. We are glad they
are in the club, The Times is not finding fault with thorn or with their
actions. I.istead we are criticising in a friendly way the system followed.
* * * *
Most of the group and a few like them were nominated as directors. Then
they began nominating about everyone else iv the room, until the blackboard
was crowded full of names and the secretary had to yell for more chalk. This
was a fair, though ancient, political maneuver.
# * # *
When, finally, the nominations were declared closed, the balloting began.
Here was where the unfairness came in.
Remember, what was to be chosen, ultimately, was three directors. Every
man should have had a vote for three men. Just as at a city primary every
one has ONI. vote for mayor, since there is one to be chosen finally. He does
not get a vote for two, tbe number to go on the election ballot.
But in this case, and in the case of the other bureau primaries, the rulos
laid down by those who have been in charge of the club provided that .the
members vote for SIX, not for three.
The result was that Lyle and Kelly and Davis and Hunt and the rest of
their clique voted solid for their ticket of six, and with the others split over a
wide field of candidates, had the satisfaction of seeing all their six chosen to go
on the club ballot.
Now next Tuesday the members of the club will have little option when
it comes to electing three directors to represent the legislation and taxation
bureau. They will have to vote for one trio or another of Kelly-Davis-Lyle
men.
#». * *
If the rules had required every member to vote for only three, as they
should have required, then the Lyle-Davis-Kelly men would have "put over"
just three. The opposition would have named the other three. Then next
Tuesday the club members oould have decided which set they wanted, as they
are entitled to decide. It would have been fair to Lyleites and anti-J.yleites.
Whether other cliques, allied or otherwise, have succeeded in dominating
other bureaus in a similar way, we have not ascertained. We hope not.
'•« * *
The remedy is simple and apparent. Change the rules for future elec
tions so that in nominating directors each bureau member gets to vote for
only three and not for six.
THAT WILL BE PERFECTLY FAIR. AND THIS NEW CLUB MIOT
BE FAIR IF IT IS TO SURVIVE AND PROSPER. "'

LONDON', Feb. "..—liow would

Balden In the mountains Of one
ot tlie most beautiful countries I
in all tbe world and protected
frc.n tbe horrors of war by the
soletr.n promisee of your bigger

territor. '.'
HIT wait:
Before you answer listen to
tlie. other wide of the story -the
side that makes poor liltle Grand
Duchess .Marie Adelaide of l.ux- ,
enibuig the unhapptost girl in all
the world.
Suppose, when Jou least ex- I
poil^d It. great liordes of (.ray
clad warriors, arnu'd to the teeth,
jbilist in upon your peaceful
laj.d, swept you and your tiny
I amy aside as If jou had been a
met*-' peasant woman, trampled
you.- royal garden under foot and
reduced your people to tlie vergi
of starvation.
lon would hate these men, no
matter how many times they told
you it was all a "disagreeable
necessitj of war."
lint would it 'mi (Tiii.li
you entirely to learn that
v>ii hud to become the wife I
of one of tlie very princes '
who led tbe armies that hail |
I'Miiseil all your trouble?
fcjnch is the plisht of beautiful, i
young Marie Adelaide.
Although she publicly voiced
her hatred of her conquerers, she
apparently MUST marry one of
their princelings. There does
not. seem to be an eligible candi
date outside of Germany and
Austria.
Marie Adelaide doesn't want to
get married at all. But that
does 11 i make any difference;
she's a grand duchess, and very
Important, and she's GOT to get
married. '
The neutral princelings are all,
too young—or they're protes
tnnts. And in 1907 a law was
passed "which forbade any grand
duchess expecting to reign over
LuM'tiiluirg to carry a protestant.
Naturally she cannot accept a
Russian or an Englishman be
cause- .tlie Teutons are now in
full charge of her little coun
try's affairs, or an Orleans or
Bonaparte prince of France.
When the present war broke
ouf the young duchess heard Ger
many intended to violate Luxem
burg's neutrality by marching an
army across it.
She dashed to her garage,
boarded her little electric run
about and sped to a bridge on
the border over which the invad
ing arttles would approach.
Thi\*e general* rode up.

breast Heaving, Marie Ade

generals told her. In olliii.
to go back to her |d«y-palttee.
She did. There was noth
ing else for her to do.
And the grand duchess and tier
five sisters remained, semi-pris
oners, in Hie palace of their an
cestors, while red war raged all
about them.
Now It is decreed that Marie
Adelaide must marry. Among

POLICE RAID HOTELS;
SEIZE SOME BOOZE
Successful for the first time
since Jan. 1, a force of nine de
tectives and police officers last
night raided three downtown
hotels, confiscated a quantity of
contraband liquor and made
three arrests.
Out of 20 raids conducted
by the police .ince the dry
law went into effect, thbi
was the first one that has
brought any results, and tlie po
lice were Jubilant today.
The hotels raided were the
Arcade, 13th and Broadway; the
Hiroshimaya, a Japanese hotel at
I.lth and Market, and tbe New
Taconia, 1317 1-2 Broadway.
Nearch Was Thorough.
Starting out on their round up
at 8 o'clock last night, the force
of detectives did not complete
their work until 2:30 this morn-
ing.
Their plan of attack at each
hotel was to station guards
at all entrances. Then the re
maining officers made a syste
matic search for booze in every
room of the hotels.
At the Arcade, four quarts of
whisky and a number of empty
whisky bottles were confiscated
in the room of W. D. Woodwort'i.
Wood worth was not in his room
at tbe time, but was arrested on
a warrant today and released ou
$.*0 cash bail.
Plenty of Kakl.
A two-gallon bottle of saki was
found In the room of N. Komotj
ln the lllroshiinaya hotel, owned
by John S. Baker. Komoto was
arrested and held on fIOO ball.
The New Tacoma was the last
hotel to be raided at 2 o'clook
this morning. Three gallons of
saki and 13 quarts of beer were
confiscated from the room of a

Woodworth forfeited his bail n.r

.lodge .'.vans ordered the police
to confiscate his liquor.
Kotnoto lias retained Attorney
Harry Lea to defend him, and
will be tried Wedncsiluy.
"Thin raid was the worst out
rage I ever heard of," exclaimed
Attorney Lea today. "The police
went through every room of the
hotel, frightening the occupants
and causing all manner of OlcltO
ment. I wonder if the police
would conduit such a raid In th.
Taconia hotel or Hie Olympus.
"Although my clients hotel Is
operated by Japanese, it raters
almost entirely to tlio trade of
white persons and Is very re
spectable.
