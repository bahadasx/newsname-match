Three Bells A
Standard School
On Monday, January 31st, Eveline
No. 2. received a well earned Standard
Plate. A large crowd had gathered for
the occasion and the district mothers
prepared a sumptioui dinner at the
school house. We sure got filled up.
The teacher, Mr. Ernest Peaslee had
arranged a splendid and appropriate
program with original music for the
occasion. We always like to hear the
boys and girls, and this time they really
meant what they said. The director,
Mr. Frank Wangeman, represented his
fellow members of the board in de
livering a short but able address. The
title of Mr. Peaslee's recitation was
"They said we couldn't but we did."
This was especially appropriate be
cause the Three Bell's district has the
smallest valuation of Eveline township
but was determined to have the best
school building. They believe that
where it is for their children it pays to
dig down, and that is what they have
done.
At the left and north of their school
room they added enough windows to
make a solid wall of glass. This brought
the percentage up to 19 per cent of the
floor area and compared to some of our
country school rooms sends a flood of
light over every desk. They did not
remove the windows at the right be
cause they wished to have the benefit
at times of the southern sunlight to
purify the air in the room. Instead
they placed, over them light, colored
window shades and keep them drawn
all of the time to prevent cross lights.
These windows can be opened in mild
weather for ventilation purposes.
The school house was already equip
ped with a ventilating system, a Wa-
terbury, which they bought three years
ago during a former contract with Mr.
Peaslee. The evil effects of the old
stove in the middle of the room are too
well known to be mentioned here. It
is enough to say that these people
threw away that old iron stove long ago
and joined the fast increasing brigade
of fresh air enthusiasts.
They have a few double seats but
every seat fits the child who has to sit
in it. The seats of one size are in one
row and they are the correct number
of inches apart so that Mary may sit
erect and work at the same time.
Johnny doesn't have to double up like
a ball to write his numbers or stretch
his ankles to make his toes reach the
floor.
Best of all are the extra tonthes
which the school board added, the few
extras which make the school worth
while, the wall was retinted, sanitary
towels furnished, books bought and the
hall way remodeled. You see, most
school houses have wide halls where
the boys can wrestle if they want to
and kick over their dinner pails and
knock down the girl's hats. But here
the partitions are moved over so the
entry way is just a little wider than the
doorway. There is nothing to do but
to come in and go straight thru to the
school room. This gives more room
ior each cloak room, the girl's at one
side and the boy's at the other. In
each cloak room is installed a chemical
indoor sanitary toilet of the Kaustine
order. These toilets are in use and
working splendidly all thru the south
ern part of the state. The cost is $50
per scat but if the sanitary conditions
and the warmth of the room could pre
vent one case of sickness, would it not
be a paying proposition? If the fact
that both cloak room are under the
direct supervision of the teacher could
prevent your little boy from seeing one
obscene picture or could save your
little girl from hearing one immoral
story, would it be worth one hundred
dollars to you?
This day marked the beginning of a
new era for Eveline No. 2. Under the
guidance of their earnest leader and
teacher, the district board has wisely
spent the money raised for this", pur
pose. Whenever there was any ques
tion as to the wisdom of any change in
the school room they wrote directly to
the , state department.. The Lansing
architects and decorators advised them
just what was best in every detail.
They were sure of every step and have
succeeded in their purpose.
At the close of the program, in be
half of the state department Co. ComV
May L. Stewart dedicated the butfding
to truth and health, and presented to
them their well-deserved and hard
earned "Standard Plate."
To make friends of men show them
how to make money; to make friends
of women show them how to become
beautiful.
School Commissioner's Notes.
Our 1916 Platform:
Uniform texts.
Uniform registers
Systematic district accounts
- Reading Circle Progress
. Extended Normal Training
School Room Improvement for health
and sanitation
15 "Standard Schools" for 1916.
We had hoped to keep the grippe
out or these notes but that bug forced
several schools to close during the
temporary illness of the teacher. In
some cases the midyear tests had to be
postponed until the boys and girls
should again be able to attend. This
will necessarily delay the returns.
The commissioner wishes to disclaim
all credit' for the preparation of the
questions recently sent to all rural
teachers. The statement at the head
ing to that enect is an entire mistake.
The questions were merely adjusted
to local conditions and the present
standard adopted thru the kindness of
the Huron county commissioner.
Colgate Co. is sending a quantity of
tooth paste samples to all teachers
agreeing to teach at least one lesson on
dental hygiene. The commissioner
had the pleasure of hearing two such
lessons taught during the past week.
We are to late to enter the j'Thrift"
contest but Uncle Luke says it's never
too late to be thrifty. "Thrift" is still
a good topic for language work.
The Palmer Co. plans on sending an
instructor here for the teacher's insti
tute to answer all dimcuities arising
from the Palmer method.
When the state inspector for "Stand
ard Schools" visited Muskegon county,
City Supt.' Frost accompanied the com
missioner and inspector in their tour of
the county. His argument was that he
wanted to get into the work, too, so
that he could help produce better
eighth grade work graduates with
which to build up his own city system.
He's a city man and a live rural booster
One side lighting is ideal; two side
lighting, bad; three side, worse; and
four side, abominable. With proper
ahading the second and third can be
used but the fourth never.
If there is a "Farmer's Institute" in
your community and you can possibly1
do so, close down your school and with
your boys and girls, join the merry
crowd. The speaker, Mr. Brown, will
assure you a splendid agriculture les
son. The Clark school has added two new
windows and has installed a fine heat
ing and ventilating system. There are
one or two schools now in all but three
townships working for a "Standard
School plate. This is a healthy conta
gion and no fad.
Moderator Topics for January 20th
contains a study of "A Man without a
Country" to be used in the April
teacher's examination. The next num
ber, January 27, contains "Birds of
Killingworth" complete with notes and
questions. Extra copies, 5c each.

Warns of Zeppelins
A device to give warnings of the ex

by Charles Gates, Norwich, England,
and depends for its operation drt the
extinguishing of the electricity supply

terrvotion of the service causes a bell

and Also lights a small battery lamp.

ELBERT BEDE SAYS
Being a pusher has its drawbacks
The lion was the king of beasts un
til man learned to get drunk.
The person who always tells the
truth will have many bandaged heads.
There is only one road to heaven and
no church has a private toll path.
The married man is the happier out
because he has no troubles, but be
cause he has no time to worry about
them.
It seems like getting an education is
a waste of time when we see so many
getting to the front on nothing but
their gall.
In the states that have equal suffrage
lawyers have learned that it is not wise
to put a man and his wife on the same
jury.
An expert is a man who is able to
make you believe that he knows more
than you do and make you pay for
being fooled.
If you would have a happy wife see
to it that she has enough work to keep
her so busy she won't have time to dig
out your faults.
When you put off anything to tomor
row unnecessarily you are making the
next day's work so hard that some reg
ular duties may havo to be post-poned.
Between those who have an inflated
idea of their own importance and those
who greatly underestimate their own
worth, there are a few who strike a
happy medium.
If you want to find out what a man
thinks of himself, read his political ad
vertisements. If you want to know
what others think of him, read the re
turns. We have seen the statement that a
genius is one having the rare faculty of
being able to read a serious book when
a lot of women are talking. In our
opinion only a dunce would try to dis
play genius in that way.
William Little of Oregon City, Ore.,
was sued on a note given for a horse.
He claimed the horse was misrepresent
ed and hired an attorney to defend
him. He was beaten, appealed the
case to the circuit court, tried it him
self and won. This is certainly a horse
on the legal profession.
STREET CORNER SAGE
Let Us Have War
The Sage stood in the post-office lob
by, reading the war news over the
shoulder of a man who had just receiv
ed his daily paper.
"The United States is Bhore goin' to
have to look out, 'er they're goin' to
git into this affair yet," he asserted.
No one seemed interested enough to
start an argument, but the old gentle
man was not daunted by the lack of at
tention. "It's a shame th' way we've been
lettin' these here other powers tramp
on our toes. Wish I was president fer
a while, er somethin where a feller
could put some real intelligence to
work. If I wuz we'd own Mexico and
a lot more terry-tory and have the
whole rest of the world afraid to
breathe fer fear this country wouldn't
approve of 'em usin' so much air. Why
I'd have"
The owner of the daily paper inter
rupted. "Who'd do all the fighting Uncle?"
he queried. "I suppose you and your
sons are willing to lay down your lives
to keep the other nations from feeling
free to inhale ozone."
"No-sir-ee" replied the Sage." There
is plenty of other fellers 'ats better off
dead, anyhow. Me'n my boys can do
more stayin here an' votin right.
And Along Came Ruth
"Curtains are always a bother to me,
and this is the season of the year when
they need attention," complained
Ruth's mother, as she surveyed the
smoked hangings of the sitting room.
"I have learned some new points
about curtains," commented Ruth,
from the cornor where she was busily
sewing upon her machine, "one is that
they should never be fastened to their
curtain rods with pins, for they invari
ably rust and leave ugly marks upon
the curtains. A good substitute for
pins is small wooden tooth picks. They
are firm and secure and do not hurt
the curtains. Then at the bottom of
each curtain, out of sight of the eye,
there should be sewed a small, rust
proof hook, so that the bottom of the
curtain may be hooked into the mesh
at any height necessary, when sweep
ing or cleaning is being done."

'IT'S NO LAUGH
ING MATTER"
To those who know and love Maclyn
Arbuckle, the happiest comedian on
the American stage, and the greatest
of our actors to portray America's
representative types, there comes the
welcome announcement of the latest
Bosworth release, "It's No Laughing
Matter" directed by Lois Weber. Mac
lyn Arbuckle has a message of happi
ness he hopes to impart to the whole
world in a miracle of sunshine and
laughter. That is why he is one of the
r
greatest comedians of today. He
laughs with the world, not at it, and
wants the world to laugh with Maclyn
Arbuckle. In "It's No Laughing Mat
ter" he doesn't really care if you laugh
at him, however, for you can't resist it;
in the language of the cronies who
hang around the post-office, he is
"durned funny!" Mr. Arbuckle is
supported by an all star cast and great
attention has been given to the back
grounds of this interesting ptcture to
make it historically and geographically
correct.

MARIE DORO in the
"MORALS OF MARCUS"
That celebrated and popular young
star, Marie Doro, one of the charming
actresses of the contemporary stage,

Locke, produced on the stage by
Charles Frohman.
Miss Doro's gifted impersonation of
1
Carlotta, the refugee from the Turkish
harem, is the nearest approach to hyp
notism from the screen that one could
imagine. She hold the audience spell-

Diamonds from Sugar
Although at first thought the state
ment seems incredible, it is perfectly
true that a lump of sugar may be con
verted into diamonds.
Not all the substances of the sugar,
of course, will enter into the compo
sition of the diamond, but only the car
bon that it contains.
Sugar consists of carbon united with
oxygen and hydrogen. It Is an easy
matter to separate out ih carbon, and
in certain experiments for the produc
tion of diamonds this sugar carbon has
been employed.
The diamonds so produced were, of
course very small, and destitute of
commercial value, but still they were
real diamonds, and the chemical result
achieved would be no greater intrinsi
cally if they were as big as the Cullin
an. Scientists have often expressed the
hope that an improvement in the pro
cess of manufacturing diamonds may
be effected whereby the necessity of
dissolving the carbon in molten iron
may be dispensed with and the re
quired combination of great pressure
with great heat may be brought about
by some such operation as squeezing
the carbon between red-hot metal
plates, Ex.
Fahrenheit
Gabriel Daniel Fahrenheit, the im
prover of the thermometer, was born
in Prussia in 1GSG. He was educated
for business but abandoned trade after
a few months in business and took up
the study of natural philosophy. He
was the first to use mercury in ther
mometers instead of alcohol. His in
strument, which fixes the freezing
point of water is 32 degrees, is the one
in general use in the United States.
