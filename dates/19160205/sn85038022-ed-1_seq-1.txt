Of Men's and Boys' Clothing,

was a wonderful success, far beyond our expecta

ates a real bargain event such as we have given
them.
In our Clothing Department ONLY the

tinue through the month of February.
We still have a lot of Men's $15 Suits at
$3.98 and Youths' Suits at $2.98, but they won't

HOBBIES
A prominent physician tells us Hint "hobbies" nre healthy
things for us to have, niul we feel that we must be blessed with
unusunlly good health, as we have ALWAYS Iincl a hobby
and it's
HARNESS!
Years ago, when leather sold for nineteen cents a pound,
our boast was that we made the best harness Hint could bo
made of good leather, good thread and good workmanship.
Now, when that same kind of leather is selling for forty-nino
and fifty cents a pound, we slill maintain that wo have tho
best harness that can be made. All you have to do to prove
that we are telling you facts is to go to the next "sale," nnd
hear ('ol. Ilensley Hawkins say in that musical drawl for which
he x so famous, "This is a set, gentlemen, o Miko Brown's
Harness. What do you bid!" Tben's when you can seo tho
farmer "set up and take notice." for be knows there will bo
some bidding on that harness,
This is (be time of the year, when Harness is foremost in
every farmer's mind, and this is the time of tho year, also,
when we are ready to sell him. All winter long our men havo
been making up harness for Spiing trade, and now wc are
ready. Of course, it's higher than when our grandfathers
used to buy it, but, considering tho prim' of leather, it's a
wonder how low in price and high in quality the Square Deal
harness is.
Come in, gentlemen, we are ready to rig up those horses.

Frlday night beforo tho largest
crowd of tlio season tho fast raris
High School basketball team went
down In tho mire of defeat boforo the
speedy flvo of the Mnysvlllo Hlg!i
School.
A preliminary Riimo between the
Freshmen nnd tho CJrado team which
wnt. played beforo tlio big game, re
sulted In favor of tho class of 1910 by
the scoro of 31 to 9, for which Cab
lleh was responsible for 14.
Tlio principal event of tho evening
was called nt 8 o'clock and after the
toss-up at center tho ball wns passed
lack and forth for several minutes
until a foul was cnllcd on M. II. S.,
nnc! Uarnctt, ono of tlio Bourbon boys'
forwards, registered on the advantage
(hot. This small lead was soon exter
minated by tlio loop-tho-loop shot of
Smoot, tho lengthy forwnrd of tho lO'
cals, who started tho ball rolling for
Maysvlllc. Not to bo outdono by his
subordinate, Captain Hampton of the
Gold and White tribe, opened up and
by some classy dodging evaded the
splendid guard, Lavln, and rung up the
second goal for the boys from .Mason
Smoot repeated. Hampton took ad-
ynntago of a foul on Adnir nnd rung
tip tho first lone point for Maysvlllc
nnd Smoot went him ono better by eag
lug another goal. Then little Edward
Parker made a fitting end of the ilrst
half and gauged his long guns nnd
pulled off his favorite shot, a goal
from the center of tlio floor. For Paris
Uarnctt wbb ahlo to get nnother free
throw In the basket, ending tho halt
with Maysvlllc on tho credit side of the
lodger by tho scoro of It to 2.
After the usual rest of twenty mill
utes of rest, during which the coaehos
of both teams exhorted their men to
get busy, tho gamo resumed. Mays
vlllc evidently must havo taken heed
of Coach Mance's words of advice, as
they started right the minute tho see
ond half was ushered In. Wood, the
consistent ccntcrspring of tho locals,
staged ono of tho circus stunts of the
evening when ho located the goa'l with
Humpty Adair, the heavy center of
tho Paris bunch, hanging on his shoul
ders. This feat was ono of the pret
tiest pieces of basketball ever seen In
this city and much applauso greeted
tho stunt. Captain Hampton, with the
aid of the local admirers, who by their
Joshing got the better of Little Itobby
Lavln, and onco started, the big cap
tain of 'the Mnysvlllo team, was im
possible to head off. t'rged on by the
cheers of the crowd, Captain Hamniy
started to ring up points nt will. Smoot
after playing with his opponent nnd
shooting baskets at will, retired In
favor of Chenny Everett, the boy with
tho big record. Chenny kept up his
reputation and soon had Adair, his
guard, guessing. Then Shea, who
had been playing tho defensive game
of his life In tho Paris end of the
court nnd who was In no small way
responsible for tho smallncss of the
rtourbonlto score, tried his cyo on the
Maysvillo basket, shooting tho ball
from well boyond tho center of the
tloor and getting a basket. This with
another basket from Shea eaded the
scoring. Haydcn and Adair after sev
eral efforts, scored sis points be-
twoen them for tlio Paris aggregation,
which was all tho scoring that Paris
could do. Tho gamo ended with Mays
vlllo in the lead to tho tune of 42 to S.
