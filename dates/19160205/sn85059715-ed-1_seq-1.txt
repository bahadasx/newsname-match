There is a decided lull at present
along the various war fronts.
Heavy artillery play continues
along the lines in northern France
and Belgium, but neither here nor
in any other of the important theaters
have there been infantry movements
resulting in exchanges of territory
worth noting so far as the
.official reports reveal.
In Slesopotamia the British relief
army under General Ayler. which has
been halted for sometimes a short
distance down the Tigris from KutelAmara,
where General Townshend's
force Is beleagured, does not appear
to have been able as yet to make >
further progress. Constantinople declares
that the British attempting to;
advance from Felahie were repulsed !
by a Turkish counter attack and
compelled to fall back to their formc-r
position.
In Albania the Bulgarians are reported
lo be having a hard time of
if and to have been obliged to fall!
back toward the Drln river near the
I eastern iront. The occupation of
strategic points by the forces of Essah |
Pasha and by Serbian troops, who
iiiivK reiurniea ar uurazzo, is Doneved
in Athens to make a new Bulgarian
expedition towards the coast difficult.
The advance of the Austrians down
the Albanian coaBt continues, the latest
advices indicating that they were
some twenty miles northeast of Dura
220.

In the Telegram for Friday February
4, we published some Interesting'
figures about Clarksburg's Industrial
strength showing particularly record,
of Industrial development during the'
last two years. These figures are?
very consoling to us in the face of
the comparative statement following
which appeared in the Parkersburg
Sentinel January 11, from the pen.
of Mr. 0, \V. Summers, Washington,
D, C., but formerly of Parkersburg:
"The number of Industrial estaolishments
in the respective cities of j
the stato is as follows: Wheeling,
201; Huntington, 102; Parkersburg,:
83; Charjeston, 89; Moundsvile, 27;1
Morgantown, 49; Blupflcld, 24;'
Clarksburg, 43.
The total number otnployed In j
these Industrial plants, Including,
owners, Btilaried employes and wage!
earners Is as follows: Wheeling, 9,-!
999; Huntington, 5,081; Parkersburg,
2,179; Charleston, 1,334; |
Moundsvllle, 1,606; Morgantown, i
^ 1,600; Bluelleld, 1,336; Clarksburg,!
V iZ'J.
The annual payroll, Including salaries
and wages was as follows for
1!H4: Wheeling, $0,428,000: Huntington,
$3,076.000, Pgrkereburg,
$1 ,367,000: Charleston, $836,000;
Moundsvllle. $1)27,000: Morgantown,
$1,067,000; Bluefleld, $904,000;
Clnrksburg, $290,000.
The capital invested In industries
j in the several cities is as follows:
I' Wheeling, $26,858,000; Hunting-!

$5,473,000; Charleston, $3,227,000;

There were few developments in the
political situation in the city today,;
there being only five new entrants, all j
Republicans, into the race for city
positions. Fourwf these five are aspirants
for councilmanic positions.
The big Bensatlon of the day in political
circles was the rumor, which f
apparently came front authoritative,
sources, that Willing H. Cole, mayor
of the city for two successive terms,
would be a candidate for the Republican
nomination for city clerk. Although
there was no confirmation of
the report, it seemed to be the gen-;
eral impression in political circles
that Mr. Cole would announce his can-:
dldacy before midnight, when the entry

government reports pretty fairly rep- <
resent the factory interests of those .
communities. In the case or Clarks-|.
burg, however, the impression creat- .
ed by this report upon business men ',
of the outside world who do not know !
our city, is not only misleading but I
positively damage to the develop- ,
ment of the community. Clarksburg I,
to the outside world appears from ,
all census reports to be not much;,
more than a modern village and the.,
remedy for this situation lies with us. i,
We know better and in every pos- ,
slhle way should proclaim this fact1,
wherever we go.
Note a few instances of contrast: 1
As to the number of establish-!
ments the government report shows'
forty-three within the city limits, I
evidently many of these are small
business establishments which we
would not class as manufacturing ,
plants and that comparisontdoes not
Indicate much.,
As to number of employed in industrial
plants, government report
shows Clarksburg as employing 122
people, while our record carefully
figured indicates that we employ approximately
5,600 people. Government
report shows annual payroll,!
salaries and wages at $290,000,;
while our record carefully figured i
shows payroll of approximately $o,-:
()6d,000, which we only believe too|
conservative. : i
Statement shows capital Invested
In Industrial plants $948,000, while';
our record shows approximate invest- '
ment $10,675,000, In strictly manufacturing
Industries. These figures
do not Include any Investment rep- j
resenting our wholesale, jobbing or
mercantile establishments, nor the j
mining, oil and gas Industrial Inter-1 [
ests, while It Is probable that the
government report does'Include some
such Interests. Look back, now und
compare this figure with our' other
West Virginia cities and I believe wn
will get a beter Idpa of our standing
In this particular.
It. Is plain to see as'representing

Manufacturers Will Meet in Indianapolis
to Consider
Working Conditions.
PITTSBUIbG, Feb. 6.?The Glassworker
saye:
In the midst of the moBt prosperous
season the American window glass Industry
has ever known, a situation Is
developing In the hand operated plants
which threatens to bring manufacturers
and workers face to face with a
aangcruut, uisirv
Working conditions are aald to be
growing voir strained In a number of
the hand plants, where Insistent de-j
manda are being made for higher |
wages. Since window glass has started
to go up, the workers' representatives
have Introduced claims for guarantee
which manufacturers think are I
unfair.
The workers have so far taken the
position of nllowing the manufacturers
to voluntarily make advances In >
wages. It Is reported, howover, that I
falling In this other means'may be;
adopted to gain their point.
Hatld plant manufacturers are In
some cases Uniting production uncertain,
It is said, and are refusing orders
that call for prompt shipment.
This matter will form one of the
principal topics of discussion at a
meeting of window glass manufacturers
which has been called to meet in
Indianapolis, !nd? next Wednesday.
Manufacturing costs will also come
In for consideration.
It is thought that the hand manufacturers
will not look with favor on
the Idea of advancing window glass
prices Just at this time.
While Pitlsburg is acknowledged to
be the logical place for such meetings,
Indianapolis was decided on tor
this meeiinr out or cousmeiuliuu
for the western manufacturer*. In
order to nave the extra time needed
In making the trip to Pittsburg.
The following call for the meeting
has been Issued:
To Members:
There will be a meeting of the
window glue manufacturers of the
United States at Indianapolis on
Wednesday, February 9. Those who
desire hotel accommodations should
make the Cliypool headquarters unless
they have a preference fpr some
other hotel, but that Is the hotel that
trill be the association's hoadquarters
