TAX ON AUTOS
But Recommend Amendment to
Page Bill So as to Eliminate
Personal Tax on Motor
Vehicles.
Commissioners Declare Amount
Should Be Determined by
Horsepower Basis Oppose
Double Burden.
With the recommendation that it
be amended so as to eliminate the
personal tax on motor vehicles, the
Commissioners sent to Congress
today a favorable report on the bill
introduced by Congressman Page
of North Carolina, to impose a
special tax on automobiles and
motor vehicles in the District of
Columbia based upon horse power.
The board recommends also that
the act become effective January 1,
1917, instead of January 1, 1916,
as provided in the proposed legis
lation. The bill provides there shall be
paid' annually as a license tax the
sum of $5 for each automobile or
mqo.r.Ye,hjcle of not more than 25
horsepower $7.50 for each autoC
mobile of Hot less than 25 nor
more than 40 horsepower, and $10
for each automobile of over 40
horsepower.
FAVOR ONLY ONE TAX.
The; Commissioners estimate there are
approximately 10,000 motor vehicles oper
ated In the District, and that under the
proposed' law the average tax collected
would be 17.50 for each, making: the total
collections JT5.000 annually.
"The advisability of providing for n
double tax, one based on horsepower
and the other a personal tax, in ques
tioned,," the Commissioners say. "The
Commissioners believe that only one tax
should be Imposed, the amount of that
to be determined by the horsepower
basis, as the double tax, as proposed In
the bill, would be excessive and burden
some.". To care for the extra work Imposed
by the proposed legislation the Commis
sioners recommend that provision be
made for the employment In the license
branch of the assessor's office of three
Additional persons at an annual salary
of S1.200 each.
An adverse report is made on the bill
Introduced by Congressman Clark of
Florida to provide for the Ineornora
tlon of the Bast Washington Suburban
Railway Company.
Want Utilities Act Amended.
The Public Utilities Commission has
before It a octltlon to require the Wash
lnKton Hallway and Electric Company

board states. "In of the opinion that It
would be Inadvisable to Incoporate new
street railway companies in the District
since the act oV Congress creatine the
said commission irlvos It nowcr to re
quire extensions of existing lines where
deemed necessary."
Favorable action is recommended on
Senate bill to amend the public ut.llt.es

Liner Baltic Warned Against
Germans Week Before Ap
pam Brought to Norfolk.
NI7W YORK. Feb. B.-Tho British ad
miralty know at least n week befdre
the liner Annam arrived at Norfolk with
a German nrlze crew that German com
merce raiders were at large In the At
lantic, according to nnssengcrs arriving
on the liner Baltic todnv.
Captain Finch, of the Baltic, who
commanded the Arabic when she was
torpedoed, was warned bv the admiralty
before sailing from Liverpool on Jan
uary Si to keep a sham lookout for dis
guised German rnlders. Ho wns In
structed specifically to permit no
steamer to approach within two miles
of the Baltic unless she was properly
identified.
News of the operations of the com
merce raiders was a deep secret in
England, however. The fact that the
Germans were operating was not pub
lished in any of the English papers
and passengers only learned of Captain
Flnch'n Instructions several days after
the Baltic sailed. A brief wireless mes
sage brought word to the Baltic of the
capture of the Appam.
Appam Statements Confirmed.
These stories, confirmed statements of
tho Appanj's bassengers. who arrived,
hero last night, that t leas two Ger
man raiders arc at large in the Atlan
tic. The Baltic, however, sighted no sus-plciou.f-looklng
tramps on the voyage
to New York. Passing through tho
Irish sea. sho maintained a' zig-zag
course to decrease the danger from
submarines. She wns not convoyea
through the war zone, but three oe
stroyers crossed her path before 'sno
passed out of the region of danger.
Trawlers In Irish Sea.
Passing through tho Irish Sea, the
Baltic encountered a fleet of rorty-nve
British trawlers, engaged in fishing ror
submarines. .Moving fifty yards apurt
and in a seml-clrcle, they dipped deep
ly with steel nets, counted upon 10
enmesh any U-boat.
The Baltic brought 173 pascsngers and

General Round-Up of All Those

SWEEPING ORDERS PUT OUT
Bold Attempt to Destroy Vic
toria Bridge Frustrated by
Sqldiers on Guard. '
OTTAWA, Ontario, Feb. 5. The
greatest round-up of allenB rtnee the be
ginning of tho war was qrdercd by tho
Canadian authorities tbday.
Tho Dominion police have been or
dered to apprehend all foreigners who
left Ottawa Thursday night when the
$3,000,000 Parliament buildings were
rurng,j
Now Seek Plotters.
The general belief In Canada now Is
that, the fire which destroyed the Kls- ,
torlc Parliament building was. started ,
by German plotters. Sir Robert Bor -
den lias Indicated ho Is convinced the j
blaze was Incendiary. I
Following another mysterious Are de- ,
stroyinn a Dig rectory monuractunng
supplies ror me government cany to-;
duy and what was apparently op at
tempt to blow up the famous Victoria
bridge at Montreal, authorities decided
to take drastic action In an effort to
round ud aliens who may be respon
sible for the sudden outbreak of vio
lence. Details of the attentat on the Victoria
bridge were wired to the government
omclals hoi c. A man was seen steal
lpg across the ice toward one or the
piers and was fired upon by guaras
after a searchlight turned upon him
showed his form in bold relief. An
Investigation was made about the pier
later today, and It is now believed the
man may have been drowned.
Following the tracks of the man on
the Ice, ho was traced to the .edge or
open water. It Is believed that in his
hasto to escape when the glare of tnn
saarc.hllght revealed him,-the supposed
plotter may ha'vo fallen Into the river.
Ao trace of bombs or other explosives
Tins found about the pier. It Is con
sidered probable they went to the bot
tom ol the river with t'.io man's bov.
Tho loss from the fire which Jb
stroyed the Grant, Holdcn it Graham
factory here early today will reach
almost half a million dollars. The fac
tory was completely destroyed and
thousands of dollars worth
of haver- i
sai&s, uniforms, tarpaulins and other
supplies for the Canadian expeditionary
forces were burned.
Guard On Duty.
An the investigation into the parlia
ment fire continued members and em
ployes became steadily, less Inclined to
accept the first .reports of tho police
that It would havo been impossible for
an alien to have started the blaze. It
was declared It would not have been
necessary for a plotter to have entered
the room In which the blaze was dis
covered at the particular time the po
lice say a heavy guard was on duty.
And the order to tho police to round
up all aliens leaving the Dominion on
the night of the fire Is accepted as final
evidence that tho government believes
an enemy Is responsible for the destruc
tion of the costly structure.
A close wach Is now being kept on
all foreigners, who are required to re
port regular to restrltton officers. By
an arrangement with the railways the
numbers and destinations of nil tickets
sold to foreigners are turned over to
the police.
It was through this system that
Charles Strony waa arrested at Wind

UIANIA READY
DECISION OVER
LUSITANIA NOW
RESTS UPON
1 PRESIDENT
"Breach Impossible," Embassy
Asserts Confidence Ex
pressed That Crisis Can Be
Averted With Germany.
Reply Fails to Meet Demands of
United States and Full Con
sideration Will Precede Dip
lomatic Decision.
The critical stage in the con
troversy between the United States
and Germany over the sinking of
the Lusitania was reached today
when President Wilson and Secre
tary of State Lansing gave con
sideration to the last German,
reply.
Full decision is up to the Presi
dent. The State Department and
German . embassy admit that Ger
many has made partial concessions
to the American demands.
But a full compliance with the
demand of the United States that
Germany shall admit tho illegality
of the Lusitania attack is- refused.
Whether the refusal of Germany
to go to the extreme limit in meet-
i
ing American demands justifies
breaking oil friendly relations with
the German government, is the de
cision the President must make.
CABINET TO HEAR CASE.
No decision is expected until the
Cabinet meeting: on Tuesday. Presi
dent Wilson and Secretary Lansing,
It U said, are unwilling; to take final
action on an Issue of such gravity
that it may mean war between the
United States and Germany without
the fullest consideration.
There are two developments' today
indicative of the hope that a break
will be averted.
First, It was announced that the in
formal negotiations, between Count
von Bernstorff and Secretary Lansing'
havo not been broken oir.
Second, no special Cabinet meotlng
was called for today, but considera
tion by the Cabinet of the German
submarine situation was postponed
until the regular meeting on Tuesday
The significance, of these development
lies in the fact that it was authori
tatively announced nl the State Depart
men after the Lansing proposals wore
sent to Berlin that if uerinony flatly
rejected the American demands the in
formal negotiations with the German
ambassador would be broken off at onco
and a formal note, amounting to on
vltlmatura, would be dispatched to Ber
lin. Before such a note went to Berlin,
it was said, the 'nblnet -would be called
in session at once to decide on final
action.
"Four or Five DayB."
After delivery of the German reply
to Secretary Lansing by Count von
Bernstorff late yesterday afternoon, it
was announced in the highest official
quarters that Germany had "made some
concessions that may lead to further
negotiation," and that "the matters
will bo at Issue for the next four or
flvo days."
At tho German embassv It la emphat
ically asserted that "a break between
the United States and Germany ia out
of the question."
Alarming reports in the Berlin press
were held to bo for home consumption,
to ''cover a retreat."
The German ambassador; expects to
see Secretary Lansing again today or
Monday for another conference.
The extreme confidence displayed by
diplomats Is taken to Indicate that the
German ambassador has been given au
thority to go farther than he has gone
If necessary to meet American demands.
In the interval before the Cabinet
meeting on Tuesday the President Is
expected to confer with leaders of the
Senate and House Foreign Relations
committees and other members of Con
gress before coming to full decision en
tho Lusitania question.
Berlin Officials Scoff
At Idea That Lusitania
Note Will Cause Crisis
BERLIN, Feb. B. Despite pessimistic
report from English sources. German
officials today scoffed at the possibility
that Germany's refusal to disavow Lusi
tania sinking will bring an Immediate
crisis in the German-American rela
tions. Further Informal exchanges between
Washington and Berlin are certain to
occur before Germany frames her for
mal answer to the last American note,
it Is stated here. The Instructions sent
to Ambassador von Bernstorff this week
call for an answer from the-American
State Department that probably will re
sult In anoihsr exchange of views,
whether the United States aproves or
disapproves the German proposals.
It Is realized here that tho situation
has grown moro serious. In dlscuslnjl
the possibilities of a break, the Germmal
