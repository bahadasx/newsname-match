State Department Decides
That Vessel Comes Under
the Provisions of the
Prussian Treaty.
PROTEST OF BRITISH
TO BE TURNED DOWN
Other Considerations Than!
International Law to be
Taken Into Account
Say Officials.
WASHINGTON. Kfh. I. Great
Britain will be told that she cannot
have the Appam. The state de
partment hifl decided that as a wa
prize th British liner brought Into
Norfolk by Lieu. Berg and a prize
crew romcH i:nder tlie provision.! of
the Prussian treaty of 1773 f:
ni-nivdd In 1C2. Therefore, it is
ent'tled to the Immunity that cones
under that document.
But sier'y T-ansing is almost con
vinced that a n war jirie tho liner
annot remain in an American port
indefinitely. H hope to dlseus.s
with tlie president iust what limita
tions must he put upon the present
ease. And when he does the decis
ion will he communicated to the
German governme-nt.
Meanwhile, Lieut. Berge and his
men will be hf to provision the
liner and cet. her in perfect condi
tion for a dash to sea should that be
necessary later on.
Rati lied Convention.
Although tho United States rati
fied The Ha sue convention few of
the present European belligerents
did. And since the war bcga;i all of
them ha,ve trampled rough-shod
(nc the most sacred of the- agree
ments t .t were re-ached there. Ee
rause of this fact, the United states
will not be compelled to pay any
serous attenton to tlie formnl de
mand. t-l in writing with the state
department by Sir Cecil Spring-Rice,
the British ambassador, demanding
that the vessel be turned ocr to
representatives of her owners.
otücials uuietly pointed out today
that there vnro other considerations
than mere international law that had
to b. taken into account in dispos
ing of the Appam problem. Popular
opinion has clothed the action of
(Jormans in sending the Appam
through tlie guard line of British
warships off the American coast with
a glamor of approval. Berge has
be-n applauded for his courteous
treatment of hi" captives.
To rob him ; his prize and turn
her back to British authority would
bo severely criticized throughout
the country. And oltlcials say that,
inasmuch a the Prussian treaty has
been Invoked by the German ambas
sador, it will be a most popular
move for the state department to
ai c-'pt its provisions in settling this
case.
It was said at tlie state depart
ment today that a complete deci
sion regarding the status f the
Appam would not be reached before
next week at the earliest.

RESENT HEAD
SLATED TO GO
Twi Members of Board Are in
Favor of Securing a New
Superintendent Vote
is Held Back.
HUBBARD TOLD TO
NOTIFY MONTGOMERY
Decision Reached at Meeting
Held Jan. 25 No Appli
cants For Position
Say Members.
L. J. Montgomery, superintendent
of city schools, is slated to go.
This decision was reached by the
school board at a meeting on Jan.
2 3, but announcement was withheld
in order to permit the present su
perintendent to select another posi
tion. The following letter written to the
president of the school board tx
rlains the situation:
fJouth Bend. Ind., Jan. 20, 19 16.
Mr. A. L. Hubbard,
South Bend. Ind.
' Dear .Sir: Since our conference in
your office on Tuesday evening. Jan.
21 decided the fact that a majority
of the board believed it was for the
best interest of the school-? as a
whole to make a change In the office
of superintendent at the close of Mr.
Montgomery's contract, we feel that
It is definitely understood with the
members of the board that a chance
is decided upon. The vote being
held hack from record to give Mr.
Montgomery an opportunity to select
another position If he desires to do
so. However, the fact was also men.
tioned that it any confusion should
start we would call a special meeting
and make it a matter of record at
unce. . ' ." . '
Inasmuch as t!?e vacancy Is de
cided upon we feel that each mem
ber of the board is- at liberty to
solicit aplpicant f..r the position cf
superintendent and an effort made
to select the best man possible for
i the position. We reall?? that this is
a very important matter and all ap
plicants should Hrst be considered
In executive se3sion of the board.
In one of your letter to your
friends you state "that someone
wants Mr. Montgomery's job." So
far as we know there are no appli
cants and Ave did not supose there
would be until this action of the
board Is at least decided among our
selves. It may then be necessary to
make it a matter of record before a
professional man would allow him
self to be an applicant. But if this
declaration can be sufficient we will
be able to give Mr. Montgomery all
tho lime he wpnta without making a
public announcement which might
have some effect on the schools for
the last half of the year.
As president of the board it will
be open to you to glvo this infor
mation to Mr. .Montgomery as you
i see fit
Trusting that we will find several
first clas men to consider for th
position in mind and feeling- sure
that we aro acting for the best in
terests of the school? of Eolith Bend,
we are.
Very respectfully yours.

SISAL TRUST IS
Department of Justice Has
Evidence But Doesn't
Know What to Do.
Intenifltion.il News Service:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 5. The de
partment of justice today faces the
unusual situation of having abund
ant evidence of the existence of a
new trust and yet being in doubt as
to its ability to prosecute the com
bination under the Sherman anti
trust law.
The new combination is the Sisal
trust. Sisal is the vegetable llbre
used to make twine for agricultural
uses such as reaping and binding.
Sisal is grown almost exclusively in
Yucatan. Mexico. The trust, which
admits that it has cornered the sup
ply, is a Spanish-Mexican organiza
tion. Unable to finance its corner,
it has enlisted the support of t. syn
dicate of American banks, chielly
New York and New Orleans insti
tutions, according to the evidence
before the department of justice.
Atty. Gen. Gregory is considering
the problem of whether this com
bination, which has- for Its object
the cornering of a foreign product
and forelsrn owned staple. corned
within the jurisdiction of American
anti-trust laws.

forth about them. Their declara
tions were corroborated by Fire
Chief Graham, who said that he had
heard five distinct explosions, such aa
would have been caused by infernal
machines while his men were light
ing the lire.
The theory that enemy agents
have opened a campaign of terror
ism in Canada of which the destruc
tion of parliament house was the
lirst act, has been strengthened by
the burning of the pbrnt owned by
Grant - Holden - Graham, limited,
which was wrecked by lire last night.
The factory has been turning out
equipment for Canadian soldiers and
Canadian officials openly express the
belief today that the lire which de
stroyed it was of incendiary origin.
As a result of the two fires in the
capital, every munition plant and
equipment factory in the country is
doubly guarded today. Instructions
have been sent to every point where
army supplies are made that close
watch must be kept on all suspicious
character?.

from the provinces of the countrv.
He announced that there would be a

of the fire and that the business -of
