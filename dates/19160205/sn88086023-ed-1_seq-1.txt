EastOregonian Has Led the Field
in Covering News of Big Storm
Su h newspapers as have arrived here thus far indicate
that ii; covering news of the big storm and its various as
P'.vts the Kast Oregonian has surpassed any other north-vv.'.-UTn
paper, large or small, in handling the news of its
own territory.
Yesterday the East Oregonian carried 21 live news
stories relating to various features of the storm or conse
quences of the storm. On Thursday we had 13 different
news stories on the subject and on Wednesday 17 stories.
These news stories have covered all the most important
and interesting phases of the storm story, from different
angles and particular attention has been given to accu
racy. Naturally special care has been accorded to con
ditions in Umatilla county and nearby counties in eastern
Oregon. In securing such news we have had the benefit
of a large Staff of special correspondents located at differ
ent points and the long distance phone service, in constant
ijse by us, has been excellent at all times.
The Kast Oregonian desires to be and thinks it is the
best newspaper in the world in a town the size of Pendle
ton. One reason for this is that the paper rises to the oc
casion and gives its readers special service when big new.,
is brewing. We are always ready to do all the work need
ed and spend all the money necessary to obtain the re
sults desired. Numerous compliments received bv the pa
per together with the fact the past year has been in every
way the most prosperous one in the history of the Kast
Oregonian shows our aggressive policy is appreciated by
the people.
