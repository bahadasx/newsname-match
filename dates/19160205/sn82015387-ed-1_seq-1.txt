DISTRICT COUT UP
BUSINESS OF DEAYED TERMS
Judge Lancaster Again Assumes His Duties, After a Long Illness
and Serious Operation. Charges Grand Jury in a Clearly
Enunciated Declaration of Their Duties and Obligatiorns.
CALLS ATTENTION TO RUMORS OF IRREGULARITIES
IN ELECTION MATTERS, VIOLATION OF LIQUOR LAWS
Tells the Jury that Under an Ordinance of the Town of Covington
the Restricted District Has Been Abolished and No Lewd
Woman Could Ply Her Trade; Neither Should Negroes.
There was more tnan usua mn
terest in the convention of the Dis
trict Court last Monday. For the
flrst time in many months Judge
Iancaster was able to assume his
place on the bench, and occurrences
Vf the recent election gave intimation
trt-the judge's charge to the grand
·3r might be a stringent criticism
of a condition that has been grow
tlag worse at each succeeding elec
tib., and that has culminated in en
aelies that have become intolerable.
Notwithstanding the trying weath
er, Judge Lancaster opened court
prbmptly at the usual timde after the
arrival of the morning train. The
serious operation which he had un
dergone and the physical and mental
strain of his illness were visible in
hit palid features, but his voice was
clear and distinct and he conducted
the business of the court with much
of his old-time energy throughout the
day's long session. Members of the
bar and other friends offered their
congratulations as he came up
through the court-yard and into the
court-room, and there were expres
siabs of pleasure on all sided that he
wms again able to assume his duties.
Charge to Grand Jury.
":Judge Lancaster's charge to the
giand Jury was an unequivocal enun
elation of their duties. They should
investigate violations of the Sunday
law and the Gay-Shattuck law. He
spoke of the editorial in the St.
Tammany Farmer relative to the re
cent election; that the people were
aroused to indignation at the ex
istence of such a condition; that he
wks not able to be out himself, but
if such things were shown to be true
it was their duty to assist in meting
odtt punishment and putting them
ddwn.
The Judge laid special stress on
a Investigating violations of the re
SatHcted district ordinance of Coving
<oAS He said the town had abolish
r led the old district and made it un
" lawful to carry on any lewd voca
tied within the town limits; that the
towrn had the right to govern itself
add to pass ordinances, and that
thdi ordinances could be enforced,
but that where there were no ordi
astees the State law was in effect.
He also called attention to the ply
lag of their trade by negro prosti
tutes. He said this should be stop
Judge Lancaster spoke with some
feeing to the jury of the inability
of the offices of the law to correct
evil conditions if they were not as
alsbd by the grand jury; that no
mAtter how much he might desire to
put -down violations of the law he
'ºa helpless if indictments could not
be obtained.
As several terms had passed rwith
out a sitting of the Court, there was
ul iquit a long docket to be disposed of
s ai there were quite a list of cases
by 'default.
; Much interest is manifested in a
eas" that may be tried next week.
In 'the matter of the election of as
rultr there is a contest of the re
turns of the first precinct (the San
dyF Ford box) of the second ward. A
p.ttiton has been filed by Geo. Koepp'
Jr., one of the candidates for asses
se, through his attorneys, B. M.
Miller, A. L. Bear and L. C. tMoise.
ThIe petition recites that the returns
were not compiled and returned prior
to~Januaarj 29; 1916, but that the
Parish Executive Committee met on
January 29 and proceeded themselves
to compile-and tabulate returns made
.-by commissioners and celrks of elec
tion after a protest in writing by the
s Petitioner that the poll list and tally
sheet required by law to be made by
cormmissioners for clerk of court and

1.-l1for Crawtord and 79 for Koepp;
.I ilother place 122 for Crawtord

that tally sheet showed 79 votes for
Czawford in one place and in an
other 74 votes, the aggregate in each
Scase being more than the actual vote
t at election; .that the Executive Comr
5 mittee made return of 1088 votes for

the committee could not legally con
sider the same or include the same
1 in its compilation or tabulation of
I the votes cast for the candidates for I
I assessor, without illegal exercise of
1 Judgment; that ift said committtee
had rejected or refused to consider
or act upon said illegal returns, the
returns from the other precincts of
the parish would give Koepp 998
votes and Crawford 971 votes.

The Labor Troubles at the Jahncke
Navigation Co.. Yards, Madisonville,
Will Probably Be All Settled Todaya j
SAlleged labor trouebia in the St.
Tammany shipyard .of the Jahncke
Navigation Company brought a
s trong protest to Labor Commission
er McGilyray from Dr. George F.
Williams, of Madisoaville, who has
taken up the cudgeI., he says, for
his fellow-townsmen. Pay rolls 8
weeks overdue and the discharging
Monday last of men who complained
are specifically state in Dr. Willia.ms'
statement.
For the past six weeks, the doctor
says, there has been so regular pay
roll at the Jahncke yard, the time
running to eight weeks on some oc
casions without a pay-day, he says.
After long stretches without the ap
pearance of a weekly envelope, the
complaint charges, the Jahncke Com
pany was in the habit oftpaying only
one week's wages, deferring payment
of the balance.
Saturday a meeting was held by
the employes of the:fMt. Tammany
shipyard and a commlittee was ap
pointed to take the matter of protest
up with Ernest Lee Jahncke. Thi:
was done and Mr. Jahncke made t
special trip to Madisonville Sunday.
He settled all disagreements and
promised to pay every week.
Monday morning Dr. Williams
tells the labor commission, hM
Jahncke discharged more than 50
per cent of his men at-the St. Tam
many plant and the Others locked
their tool boxes and leftito seek work
elsemwhere. -
Jahacke Declares
It. "Misstatement."
Continuing, Dr. Williams writes:
"Now, it further developed that
Mr. Jahnoke telephoned the other
shipyards, to whom he had allotee
his work to be completed, and re
quested or demanded that they em
ploy no one whom he had dismiss
ed."
When shown a copy of the Madi
sonville letter Wednesday morning
Mr. Jahncke declared it was a mis
statement of the facts in the case.
He heard of dissatisfaction at the
St. Tammany yard and he went over
Sunday, taking with him ample mon
ey to pay all the men employed there,
he says. Rush of business owing tc
the National Foreign Trade Conven
tion last week was the cause of a
small delay in getting the pay roll
to Madisonville, he declares.
"We have been enga.ing men at
the St. Tammany yard lately," said
Mr. Jahncke, "not because we need
them, 'but in order to keep *them
busy. There was no hurry about .th
work we wanted done, and we, are
not moving much gravel and sand
now. Our equipment is iole at all
our wharves and yards.
"Sunday everybody in the Madi
sonville yard was thoroughly satis
fled, with the possible exeption of
one negro tcaulker. I had agreed tc
do more than the men asked. I amr
sure that the people of Madisonville
do not feel as Dr. Williams' letter
would indicate."-N. O. Daily States.

to adopt or reject the plans for wat

Mr. Jahacke. It is stated by a well

formerly worked for the Jahnckc
Navigation Company at Madisonville,
!and who now has two sons employed
by the company, that the sentiment
of the employees of the company Is
not in conformity with the letter
written to the Daily States and to'
this paper. In fhct he states that
the employees may write a letter en
pressivq of appreciation and esteem
for the company. It is also stated,
that Mr. Jahncke will be in Madison

be made for all men to go to work
with perfect satisfaction to all con.
earned.
