COLLECTORS PUT IN A
STRENUOUS AFTERNOON
Books Will Be Cataloged and Ar

State Librarian.
When the first day's book collection
closed last evening, the Bismarck
public library was only lCti volumes
short of the 1,000 set as the number
•which will open the reading room and
library, February 22.
'Messrs. Jl. C. liattey and iGeorge
H. Will, the volunteer collectors, put
in a strenuous afternoon, which took
tliein over every street and avenue
in two-thirds of the city. The raw­
ness of the air and the unusual abund­
ance of snow did not make cliauffeur
ing for books an. unmixed pleasure,
but the gentlemen stuck if, out, and
when they returned to the Commer­
cial club rooms late in thejufternoon
•both seats of their car, the tonneau
floor and every other available inch
of space was packed with books.
Total Harvest, 529.
Mrs. J. P. Dunn, chairman of the
committee of club women, ladies who
had conducted the canvass, turned
over to the Commercial club yester­
day noon a list of ISO homes which
had agreed to contribute from one to
fifty books. These names had been
listed by streets, and a few minutes'
work with the typewriter auflicied to
complete the routing in a manner
which enabled the collectors to cover
the ground without doubling on one
another'^ tracks.
•Many housewives had not been able
to find time to sort out the books
which they wished to contribute, and
these will be called for later. In a
number of cases it will also be neces­
sary .to call at homes where the mis­
tresses were out yesterday afternoon,
and in. additiofi to these return calls
there are probably 4Q homes which
could not be reached in the time al
loted yesterday.

Reception February 22.
'February 22 is the date set for the
opening of the library, and it is felt
that everything can be in readiness
by that time. All of the ladies of
Bismarck will act as hostesses at an
informal reception and tea to signal­
ize this event, and everyone in Bis­
marck will be extended an invitation
to attend.
The reading room will be open to
•lie general public from 9:00 a. m. to
12:00 every, forenoon from 2:00 to
6:00 p. m, and probably from 7:30 to
0:30 in the evening, every week-day.
Books will be loaned under the usual
library regulations to any resident of
Bismarck or Burleigh county, it is
probable. There will be just as little
red tape as possible. The reading
room is centrally located comfort­
ably furnished and will, it is believed,
prove generally popular with the pub­
lic fro mthe start.

Francisco Villa is encircled by forces
of the de facto government and can­
not cross the' international line, if
that be his objective, according to
General Gabriel Gavira, commandant
at Juarez, who said Villa was sur­
rounded somewhere between Ojo Cal

south from Juarez, today reported
that he vras detraining 150 men at Ojo
Calientes to meet bandits who were
appearing as the result of the drive
of Carranza troops from the east,
south and west.
The Juarez commandant' express­

lion train, was endeavoring to break
through the circle of the Carranza
troops and reach the Bosque Bonieta
country.
United States cavalry border pa­
trols have been ordered to Watch for
and arrest Villa and his men, should

FIVE LIVES LOST
Two Women and Three Men Are
Known to Have Perished in
Fire at Ottawa, Canada.
POLICEMAN REPORTS
HEARING EXPLOSION
Ottawa, Ont., Feb. 4.—Two wonion
and three men are known to have
perished in the :fire which swept
through the central portion of Can
sida's mttgnilicen Parliament building
last night, destroying the senate and
chamber of commons.
All night long, the firemen, police
ani .soldiers fought tp.jfj v.e the
•WMfcwO structure, wliich is considered
one! of the finest examples of Gothic
architecture on this continent. They
were successful in saving the beauti­
ful library building and main wings
of the east and west buildings.
Explanation of Fire.
An explanation of hr.w the fire
started, which has been accepted by
Col. Sherwood, was supplied today by
the policeman I10 was on duty at
the senate entrance.
The policeman said he sa«v v. blai
in a pile of newspapers in the reading
room. He attempted to put it out
with a chemical extinguisher and,
failing, ran for help. When lie re­
turned with another extinguisher, the
fire had swept through the room and
was beyond his control. The room
was lined with wood and completely
filled with reading stands and lilos cf
newspapers.
In partial contradiction of this ver­
sion, another policeman, who was at
the commons entrance to the reading
room, insists there was an explosion
in the chamber which burst tlio doors
and swept him off his feat
Arrest 'Suspect.
Windsor, Ont., Feb. 4.—Declaring
that he is suspected of being impli­
cated in the destruction of the parlia­
ment building at Ottawa, the provi­
sional authorities late this afternoon
took into custody Charles Strony,
aged 28, who says he is a Belgian mu­
sician.
Acting on instructions received
from Col. J. S. Sherwood, chief of the
Dominion police, local officers took
Srony from a Canadian Pacific train
arriving here from Ottawa. Strony
characterized the charge as ridiculous.
He will be held pending further in­
structions from Ottawa.
160 REPORTED LOST
Shanghai, Feb. 4.—The Japanese
liner Daijin Maru was sunk Wednes­
day night in a collision with the
steamship Linnan, and 160 lives were
lost. Twenty-one persons were saved.
The Linnan, badly damaged, is re­
turning to Hong Kong.
The collision occurred at night at a
point SO miles from Swatow.
The Daijin Maru was owned in
Osaka. The Linnan is owned by the
China Navigation company of London.
ALL TRADE RECORDS
New York, FeD. 4.—All previous
records for one calendar year of trade
between the United States and South
America were 'broken in 1915, accord­
ing to figures made public today by

National City bank. Imports from
South America last year reached an
estimated total of 1320,000,000, and
exports to South America, $145,000,

German and American Construc­
tion of Word Block Lusitania
Negotiations.
WASHINGTON ADMITS
SITUATION IS GRAVE
Secretary Lansing and President
Wilson Will Consider German
Reply Fully.
Washington, Feb. 4.—The one word
"illegal" as differently interpreted in
the United States and Germany pro­
trudes from the tentative draft of the
Lusitania agreement, perfected by
Ambassador Bernstori'f and Secretary
Lansing, as the stumbling block
which lias caused Berlin to refer to
the
Defoliations
as having reached
a crisis and Washington to character­
ize the situation as grave.
Germany's answer proposes instead
of an out and out' admission of illeg­
ality of the methods of submarine
warfare used by the German naval
authorities in sinking the liner, an ac­
ceptance of the liability of neutral
lives which Berlin hopes will satisfy
the United States and still not bind
Germany from continuing the submar­
ine campaign.
Humiliating to Germany
German ollicials believe that their
previous promise to discontinue sink­
ing unresisting merchantmen without
warning brings the submarine cam­
paign within the pale of international
law and that any inclusion of that
phase in the Lusitania agreement is
unnecessary and humiliating to the
Imperial government.
The word "illegal" in the draft the
German ambassador transmitted to
his government, as meeting all the
contentions of the United States,- is
taken as having been regarded in
Berlin as being susceptible as ajpplK
cation not only to tlie'Lusitania case"
but to the entire submarine campaign.
That' is the only explanation which
officials here can find for the state­
ment of Captain Zimmerman "that
the United States suddenly made new
demands which it is impossible for us
to accept."
Secretary Lansing declared today
that the position of the United States
was unchanged and the German am­
bassador knew of no demands which
were not embodied in the proposal he
sent to Berlin.
Situation Unchanged.
After the ambassador's visit to the
state department today, Secretary
Lansing declared "the situation is un­
changed."
That may be authoritatively stated
to represent the situation accurately.
It' had become more grave, and by
that fact it has become no less grave.
Its status has not materially changed,
and it may remain so four or five days
at least, while President Wilson and
Secretary Lansing consider Germany's
answer fully.
In a like manner, it may be stated
authoritatively that it does not follow
that either a, complete satisfactory
agreement or an open break must
follow at the end of that time the
negotiations may continue.
$500 FOR ONE KISS.
Kansas City, (Mo., Feb. 4.—The Met­
ropolitan Street Railway company to­
day, under settlement reached in the
circuit court here, agreed to pay Miss
Evelyn Whittington, aged 10 .500 for
a kiss administered bv one of the
company's conductors on a car one
night in January, 1915. She was the
only passenger, she said. She sued
the company for $25,000.

BY SENATE
Greater Degree of Self Govern­
ment for Islands Independ­
ence in Four Years.
REPUBLICAN SENATORS
VOTE FOR MEASURE
Naval Baseband Coaling Station
Will Be Maintained on the
Islands.
Washington, F?b. 4.—The Philip­
pine bill, which would extend to the
Islands a greater degree of self-gov­
ernment and would authorize the
president to grant hem absolute in­
dependence within four years, passed
the senate tonight ~Z to 24.
Various Democratic. senators, lead
by Chairman Stone of the foreign re­
lations committee, tried unsuccess­
fully to secure amendments of certain
features of the Independence clause,
but in the end, the Democrats joined
by Six Progressive Republicans voted
solidly for the measure.
It is understood the bill will go to
the house with the backing of Pres­
ident Wilson, and «'iil be pressed for
early passage. There has been little
indication of what action the house
will take, but administration leaders
tonight seemed confident that the bill,
including the independence features,
which .Democratic senators declare
squares it with the Baltimore plait
form, would have tin- approval of the
house Democratic majority.
Republicans Vote "Aye."
The Republican senators who voted
for the bill v/ere Borah, Clapp, Ken
yon, LaFollette, Norris and Works.
By overwhelming majorities the
senate had refused to modify the
Clarke amendment adopted several
days ago, which contains the inde­
pendence provision and also gives the
president authority to extend or with­
hold independence u£

end of four
years, if he shoutf^-# conditions in
the Islands unfavorable.
The time will be extended, however,
only until an incoming congress could
consider the subject.
"Wilson a Militarist."
Senator Norris in opposing a pro­
vision in the bill, empowering the
president to retain naval bases in the
Philippines, declared President Wil­
son had been converted from a man
of peace to a militarist.
As passed, the bill carries a provi­
sion authorizing the president, when
independence is granted, to negotiate
treaties needed to adjust all property
rights of citizens of the United States,
and other citizens in the Islands, and
to acquire such naval bases and coal­
ing stations within that territory as
he deemed necessary.

Confidential
Marksmanship
Records Given
Washington, Feb. 1'.—Confidential
marksmanship records of the navy
were detailed to the house naval com­
mittee behind closed doors today by
Captain C. C. Plunkett, gunnery offi­
cer of the department. At an open
session, he discussed the subject in
general terms and said the appropria­
tion last year to provide prizes for
gun pointers would have been insuffi­
cient had not ihe ((un ifications under
which they were to be earned been
raised by the department.
"They got. a burst of speed," said
Captain Plunkett, referring to the gun
pointers, "and would have swamped
us."
Captain Plunkett said approximate­
ly 75 percent of the enlisted force of
the navy from ship cooks to chief
petty officers had qualified as marks­
men in riile practice.
LIKEJBOEWE
Wife of British Officer Says Two
Escaped From Kiel on New
Year's Day.
PLOT TO OVERCOME
PRIZE CREW FAILED
New York, Feb. 4.—Nine sea raid­
ers of the type of the Moewe have
been litted out by the Germans and
one of them, which escaped from Kiel
on New .Year's day with the Moewe,
has since been preying on British
commerce, according to a story told
here tonight by Mrs. Francis Fuller,
wife of the British governor general
of Ashanti.
Mrs. Fuller \va% one.of the 97 pas­
sengers of the Appam who arrived
here from Norfolk, Va., on board the
Old Dominion steamer Jefferson.
Moewe Is New Boat.
Mrs. Fuller declared that one of the
German officers who came aboaru the
Appam was authority for the state­
ment that the Germans had equippe 1
the nine raiders at Kiel. She said he
told her the Moewe and the other
raider which escaped the British pa­
trol passed within a stone's throw of
three British cruisers within a few
hours after they left the Kiel canal.
All the British officers and seamen
agreed that the raider, apparently,
was a new vessel of about 6,500 tons
gross. Her coal bunkers, they said,
were unusually large, as if built for
long cruises.
Plot Fell Through.
M. C. Watson, also a passenger on
the Appam, told of a plot to over­
come the Germans who comprised the
prize crew of the Appam. Watson,
who said he volunteered as third offi­
cer on the Appam, declared that plot
was frustrated through treachery and
that it would be made the subject of
a report to the British consul general
in New York.
"The Germans," added Watson,
"were fearful of us, and ignored many
insults that' were hurled at them."
MURDER AND SUICIDE.
Douglas, Mass., Feb. 4.—Miss Lena
S. Keyser of Schenectady, N. Y., was
shot and killed here today by John H.
Pierce, of Dolonson, N. Y., who after­
wards shot himself, according to the
police. The couple were about to be
married when Miss Keyser's mother
appeared and urged them not to go
through with the ceremony. Physi­
cians said Pierce probably would die.
HANDFUL OF GERMANS TAKE BRITISH LINER APPAM MAKE IT A PRIZE OF WAR
British steamship Appam.
The British steamship Appam, believed sunk off the coast of Africa with 400 souls aboard, was brought into Norfolk, Va., February 1, by
German prize crew of 22 men. To escape capture by British cruisers, the Appam was driven across the Atl*ntic,_through a cordon of British WMj
ships and into the neutral American harbor. The exploit of this handful of Germans is regarded as the most a mating in the war.

FORMAL REQUEST
RADEJOR Ml
British Ambassador Requests
That Ship Be Turned Over to
British Consul.
Washington, Feb. 4.—In the name
01' the British owners of the steamship
Appam, Sir Cecil Spring Rice today
lodged with the state department a
formal request that the ship be .turned
over to the British consul under the
terms of the Hague convention.
Notice also was served that it
would be in violation of international
law, if the United States permitted
the German prize commander of the
'Appam, either to increase the effi­
ciency of that ship, add to her offen­
sive power, or recruit his crew.
Lieutenant Berge has only 22 m67l
in his prize crew at present, a num­
ber insufficient to navigate a ship as
large as the Appam. A compliance
with the British suggestion only on
the hitter points would effectually pre­
vent the departure of the Appam from
Newport News.
German Requests.
Newport News, Va., Feb. 4.—Thir­
teen of the 20 Germans, who aided
Lieutenant Berge's German prize crew
in bringing the captured British liner
Appam across the Atlantic and into
Hampton Roads, presented a written
statement to Collector Hamilton to­
day outlining their wishes as to what
disposition should be made of them
and asking for a ruling of (American
officials.
The statement was held as confi­
dential by the collector, and will be
forwarded to Washington. It is un­
derstood, however, that it contains
information on whether their service
with the prize fcrew was voluntary, a
point which may have an important
bearing on the decisions of officials.
