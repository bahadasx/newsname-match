WHO WILL EXPLAIN IT? Campbell ntlien
TVfok before lust two. things eral days r ruin
happened in Southeast Missouri
that were very similar. Oil WM
of quite na much internet to tin'
public ns tlM other Yet the
newspapers of this tod of the
-tatc made much noise about one
and suppressed the other.
One Concerned an unknown pro
tectant preacher in Pemiscot
OOUnty named Hake, who had de
Mlvari n bIp( and skil'ped. He
The )us: scv -

IO Wing coin wcamer ami iiioit
rain, have filled the St, Francli
rner with overflow of water, To
take care of this surplus water
we have lieen building dirt levees
on the Missouri side to protpct
our farmers These leveei Forced
the surplus waters over the lOW
lands of Al kalis. is and. to protect
their fanners, she had to hlllld

Djy table had much to

sa.v. c
cording to these papers ww
preacher was being hunted down
and. If caught, would he severely
.lea It with.
The other Incident of a similar
nature concerned a Catholic mis
.."ary priest who is a native of
Southeast Missouri and well
Known especially among Catho
lic's. He was accused of bavin
love affair" with a youna
girl that he promised to marry
In two days the Cape l.nariiea
Tribune printed about eight col
umns of details about the affair
Including ten le.ters aliened to
have been wi iteii by the priest to
the girl Vet not a paper In
Southeast Missouri mentioned it
Will these editors please explain
arhy there Is so much "news ' val

..,, Mtunlw ,min2 wroniT. an!
nr.ru ni nil when a priest break- U'allac
over the traces".'
So far as 1 know, these edito-s
are all proteetnnte. And the
reason I mention it is to prove
how "free" the preaeof this coun
try is. All understand the priest
ly boycott and none want their
papers put under ' the ban. '
And the politieians are exactly
like the editors. Nobody on the
OUtaide has the least idea of the
political power or the puesj -footing
priest-hood. I't an vof,i-
clal, a law-maker or a court
Judge refuse to dance to their
anisic and "the ban" is put ODhlm.
He is marked for destruction.

MAN'S DESTINY,
By Victor Hugo
stage by stage man must leave
behind bint the false dreams of
physical strife, the antagonism
or hi fellows, the sharp pursuit
of his individual needs. He will
not leave sorrow, he will not
leave tent) tatlon, At every step
will appear new evils to be
conquered. This, his curse, is nlso
his blessinc for only in battle can
the soul of man be strengthened
for immortality For this strug
gleceaseless, eternal, glorious
the strueele upward, by means
of the perfect law of liberty, into
celestial light I believe that So
cialism will, in wonderful and un
foreseen measures, set free the
soul of man.
in the twentieth century, war
will be dead, the scaffold will be
dead, hatred will be dead, front
ier boundrles will be dead, dog
mas will be dead; man will live.
He will possess something higher
than all these, a great country,
the whole earth, and a great
hope, the whole heaven.
