SEVEN COUNTRIES
SEND QUOTA TO I
HBG. ACADEMY
South America Strongest With
Four or Five Representa
tives
9 STATES REPRESENTED
New Dormitory Crowded to the J
Doors; Over Fifty Hoarders
at Local School
Representatives from six foreign
countries and nine separate states of
the Union are here in the city engaged
in important business, the most impor
tant business that could possibly oc
cupy their time at this juncture, as you
will agree when you discover what
it is.
The recently erected dormitory of
Ihe Harrisburg Academy, which, under ,
the careful and broad-minded super- j
vision of Headmaster Arthur E. Brown,
is expanding both in scope and pres
tige, houses forty-six boarding pupils
in this the first year of its existence.
Besides these there are five or six
more boarders who represent the over
flow and are living in the cottages
above the Academy. Scattered through
♦ his live bunch of "Tom Browns" a
careful observer might discover the
swarthy complexion of the scion of
one of Central America's greatest fami
lies; the peculiarly piquant features of
one of our Japanese brothers; the
somewhat similarly favored physi
ognomy of a Chinese lad: a son of
France: a number of young fellows
who claim South America as their
home, and Inst of all, "a bloody
1 [englishman." as Rudyard Kipling af
fectionately terms them.
\ Cosmopolitan Aggregation
All of these boys, thrown together
with well nigh a hundred and fifty
red-blooded, active young scapegoats
who are constantly making history for
the Academy on the athletic field and
in the classroom and in other fields of
endeavor, have been taken in and
made to feel at home, and although
with a number of them there is that
natural reserve characteristic of their
race, the strangeness is gradually
wearing off and they are all entering
with enthusiasm into the spirit of the
Academy's activities.
To get down to personalities, it
would he a great pleasure to you to
meet George Cordovez. son of Charles
< 'ordovrx. a prominent engineer of
Ecuador, South America, whose family
has the reputation of being the wealth
iest in that country and whose home
in that wonder land of promise has
more the appearance of an enormous
i astle than an ordinary dwelling. Then
there is Joseph Lee, the 14-year-old
lad from far-off China, who hasn't
time just now to worry as to whether
Yunn-Shi-Kai is going to "get away
with it" in the recent change of his
land from a republic back to a
monarchical form; Young Lee's par
ticular business is to get an education,
and he has been sent here for that
purpose by a well-to-do society woman
in Philadelphia; the young man is full
of life and a "real" boy. And of course
we mustn't forget Luis Alvarado, 17
years of age, of Central America,
whose brother-in-law is the consul
general of Honduras; nor Onofre Cas
tells. from Ecuador, a son of Jaime
fasteHs, who is a big shoe manu
facturer of that country and ships
large quantities of his product to the
United States. The gentleman from
England is a Methodist minister, is
24 years of age, and is paster of the
Methodist Church of Ilummel.stown,
Pa. Percy Boughey is his name.
Many States and Cities Represented
The following states have all sent
their quota to the Academy's halls for
the ensuing year: New York. Penn.
sj lvanla, New Jersey, Maryland, West
Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, In
diana and Michigan; Mnd these cities
are likewise represented: Philadelphia,
Pittsburgh. Clarion, New York city,
Brooklyn. Baltimore, Lebanon. Lan
caster, Altoona, Narberth, Greencastle,
< Chester, Overbrook, Johnstown. Nor
folk, Scranton, Warren and Mifflin,
and, of course. Harrisburg.

New York, Feb. s.—lndentity of
the masked highwayman of the At

Appam off the Canary Islands on Jan
uary 15 and sent her to Norfolk a Ger
man prize of war was made known last
night by officers of the other British
steamships she captured and sank,
when they arrived here with the Ap
pam's passengers from Norfolk on the
Old Dominion liner Jefferson.
These officers went on board the
raider and had ample time to look
her over from stem to stern. They
agreed, as Lieut. Hans Berg, who took
the Appam to Norfolk lias insisted,
that the captor was the Moewe. But
she was not the surveying ship Moewc
or any other Moewe known in marl
time circles. She was a new freight
steamship equipped with guns, and as
one of the sailors from her in the de
tail to the Appani told Mrs. Francis
Fuller, wife of the Commissioner Gen
oral af Ashanti, who was an Appain
passenger, the raider was one of a
fleet of nine such vessels fitted out by
the Germans to prey on British mer
chantmen, two of which already have
made their way out of the Kiel Canal
to the high seas.

BARON MUNCHAUSEN JR. TAKES
WHOPPER OF A HOT AIR BATH
Denies His Anabiosa Killed Him and Tells Amazing Tales in
A'eu> York; Promoted Cold Storage Hotel Here in 1913
Count August Seymour, who in the]
summer of 1913 told a Telegraph re-j
porter that he lived years and years |
ago. and was Petronious, special guard j
to Caesar, and later was reported to •
have died, is very much alive. This j
news came from New York, where I
the Count last night told a thrilling!
tale.
Shortly after leaving Harrisburg
last year, Count Seymour was re- j
ported to have died from an overdose |
of anablosa and contrablosa prepara- ,
tions of his invention used for cold
storage purposes. It was claimed that
a dose of these new preparations
properly taken would permit a man ■
to freeze himself and remain in cold
storage for 1.000 years, and wake up
a rich man, providing he would put j
his money in the bank before going!
in cold storage. The New York Sun 1
to-day says:
"Looking the picture of health, 1
fount August Sliappelysky de Muk
kadel de Castellane Seymore (he
wrote it out himself) came into The
Sun office yesterday to say that the
reports of his death were greatly ex- I
aggerated and to tell a ftory that!
could not possibly be exaggerated. The j
Count, it seems, was not dead, but
sleeping.
"It is most disconcerting to have!
every one think I am dead, said the;
Count earnestly, twirling his Kaiser- j
like mustache. I have to take twenty !
minutes every time I meet a gentle- j
man friend to persuade him I anv alive.
Now if you print that 1 am alive and
all your thousands —hundreds of thu
sands —of readers read it, it will save
me the twenty minutes.
So The Sun assures its readers that
the Count really is very much alive,
even though The Sun printed in its
issue of January 2, 1914. that the;
Count had been hoist by his own pet
ard, had died while experimenting
with a suspended animation serum
which he hoped would prove that
death was easily deprived of its
sting.
What follows is the count's own
story of bow the genie in a little black 1
bottle containing bourbon whisky
charmed him back to life after an un
dertaker had seen his big toe wiggle, i
also an authentic account of his ex
ploration of Tibet, the erocodilephant,
the pelliglraffe, anabtosa nnd contra- :
biosa and other prodigies.

Canadian Who Won Bride at

Back With Him
When Archibald Carmichael returns
to bis home in Kindersley, Saskatche
wan, during the next few weeks about
two score fellow-members of the River
Brethren sect will accompany him to
the valleys of the Canadian province,
jit is understood, with the vifcw of es
tablishing another little colony of the
people of that denomination in Can
ada.
Mr. Carmichael got into print about
a week ago when he came all the way
from Canada to attend the annual
Bible conference of the River Breth
ren at the Messiah Mission, Grantham,
Pa. That was Mr. Carmichael's os
tensible intention anyway. His real
purpose, however, was developed a
few days later at the Dauphin county
marriage bureau when he and Miss
Roxanna Anger, matron of the Mes-
I siali Home, called to get a marriage
license. They were married a day
later.
In various parts of the Saskatche
wan there are many little colonies of
the peace-loving River Brethren and
Carmichael's stories of the Canadian
•land of promise have been so glowing
that the people in and around Gran
tham have expressed a desire to jour
ney into the domain of England's big

OPPOSING ARMIES
ARE DEADLOCKED
ON ALL FRONTS
Decided Lull in Fighting;
Heavy Artillery Play
Continues
RELIEF ARMY STOPPED
British Mesopotamia Unable to
| Make Headway; Bulgars Fall
Back in Albania
There is a decided lull at present
; along the various war fronts. Heavy
artillery play continues along the line
in France and Belgium but neither
here nor in any of the other import
! ant theaters of operations have there
I
been infantry movements resulting in
exchanges of territory worth noting,
so far as the official reports reveal.
In Mesopotamia, the British relief
army under General Aylmer which has
been halted for some time a short dis
tance down the Tigris from Kut-El-
Amara, where General Townshend's
force is beleaguered, does not appear
to have been able as yet to make
further progress. Constantinople de
clares that the British attempting to
•advance from Felaliier were repulsed
by a Turkish counter attack and com
pelled to fall back to their former
positions.
Bulgars Fall Back
In Albania where a mixed situation
j prevails the Bulgarians are reported
to have a hard time of it and to have
been obliged to fall back toward the
j Drin river near the Eastern frontier.
The occupation of strategic points by
the forces of Kssad Pasha and by Ser-
I hian troops who have reformed at
Durazzo is believed in Athens to make
a new Bulgarian expedition toward
the coast difficult.
The advance of the Austrians down
the Albanian coast continues, the
latest advices apparently indicating
that they were some twenty milei
northeast of Duranzzo. The arival of
2,000 Montenegrin troops at Durazzo.
after a fatiguing retreat, is an
nounced.
