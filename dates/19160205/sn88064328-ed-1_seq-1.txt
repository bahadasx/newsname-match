There was ample incentive to
revolt, apart from any outside in- i
spiration or interference. The '
people of the isthmus had ne j
derived any very substantial bene-j
tit from their political eoimeetiou ,
with Colombia. Only about one
tenth of the revenues collected
from them were spent for their
benefit aud what protection they
received from the I'nited States.
I'o be tints used as a political as
set for the benefit of a knot of
corrupt politicians at Bogota was
certainly not well calculated to
strengthen their feeling of al
legiance. Viewed in the light of
Colombia's past indifference to
ward the welfare of the isthmian
state, it seems natural that when
the Hay-IIcrran treaty, drawn
with a view of insuring continu
ity of construction work on the
Panama canal, was rejected by
Colombia, the people of the isth
mes should have done exactly
what they did do, since rejection
involved selfish sacrifice of their
interests and ruthless blighting of
their hopes.
Colombia raav be entitled to
compensation for the loss of her
reversionary interest in the Pan
ama railway, but it would be hard
to sustain a $15,000/100 valuation
of that interest, we think.—Beau

PARKER AND HIS PARTY.
It is estimated that should Mr.
Parker, the (republican-progres
sive candidate for governor, in the
general election, receive every
cast vote for Barret and all those
who remained away from the
polls, he would still lack thou
sands of votes of election. As a
matter of fact, nearh all, at least
!)0 per cent of the Barret vote,
will go to Pleasant in the general
election because they are demo
crats. The result of the primary
has completely eliminated Parkea"
from the race, and his continuance
in the campaign will only be for
the purpose of establishing his
party in the state by receiving 1(1
per cent of tlie vote, a purpose
which the Beacon-Xews has al
ways believed the republican-pro
gressive candidate had in view.—
Richland Beacon-Xews.
