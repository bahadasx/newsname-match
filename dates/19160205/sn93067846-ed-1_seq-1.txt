until his little daughter came to the
top, when he seized her and swam
out with her. Meanwhile the horse
floundered Into still deeper water and
was drowned.
Mr. Harby stated that he so fully
realized the close call that he and his
child had, that he could not regret
the loss of the horse, although he was
a very valuable animal, since he and
hla daughter got out safely.
The accident took lpace about 11.30
o'clock In the morning when Mr. Har?
by was coming into town. For some
unknown cause the horse became
frightened when nearly In front of the

trol him, the animal had gone down
the embankment into the water,
which is about twelve or more feet
deep at this point. Mr. Harby went
down In the buggy, but succeeded in
getting out and on top of it without
going under the water, but his little
daughter went under and he caught
her as she came to the surface. To?
day he was receiving congratulations
upon his escape.
The stallion lost by Mr. Harby was
Monte Christo McDonald, a thorough?
bred animal secured by Mr. Harby
from Kentucky about, two years ago

cordance with latest Information on
range of the foreign guns and naval
guns. The board's purpose, Col.

IX CHICAGO SPEECH T ? DENT
CALLS FOR INCF ?o /.
-r- sf
Wants Immediate St^ s> un to Eh?
large Army and T to Strength
Deemed Necessa:
Chicago, Jan. 31.?The United
States had made preparations for
immediate war as far an Ahe navy is
concerned, although UtSrpresent naval
force Is inadequate* l?4 size, President
Wilson declare** tonight In an address
before sevot ""housand persons In
the audit/ at ,#re. "We mean busi?
ness," he s in speaking ot the pre?
paredness plans of the administra?
tion.
"We have given to the present fleet
of the United States an organization
such as it never had before, t am told
by Admiral Fletcher," the president
said, "And we have made prepara
tlo'jtfor immediate war so far as the
ri' y is concerned.
*'The army," he said, as at present
constituted, "is not large enough even
for the ordinary duties of peace."
The president repeated his warn?
ings that no time must be lost in
strengthening the defenses of the na?
tion. He declared the government
was doing everything it could for
preparedness.
"When I see some of my fellow
citizens spread tinder where the
sparks are falling I wonder what
their ideal of Americanism is," the
president said.
America, the president said, had
been cruelly misjudged by the na?
tions now at war.
"I know that on the other side of
the water there has been a great deal
of cruel misjudgment with regard to
the reasons why America has remain?
ed neutral. Those looking at us from
a distance do not feel the strong
pulses of Ideals and principles that
are in us.
"They do not feel the conviction of
America that our mission Ik a mis?
sion of peace and that righteousness
can not be maintained as a standard
in the midst of arms. They do not
realise Jhai back , of . a\\> of _ our
energy we are a body of idealists
much more ready to lay down our
lives for a thought than for a dollar.
'They suppose, some of them, that
we are holding off because we can
make money while others are dying,
the most cruel misunderstanding that
any nation has ever had to face."
Rulers, not public opinion, brought
about the present war, Mr. Wilson de?
clared. "I thank God there is no man
in the United States who has the au?
thority to bring on war without the
consent of the nation," he said.
The task of the United States, he
said, has been to assert the principles
of law in a world in which the prin?
ciples of law have broken down.
"We are not now thinking of in?
vasion of the territory of the United
States," the president declared. "We
are not asking ourselves shall we be
prepared only to defend our own
homes and our own shores. We stand
pledged to see that both the continents
of America are left free to be used
by their , people as those people
choose to use them under a system
of national popular sovereignty as ab?
solutely unchallenged as our own.
"At this moment the Americas aro
growing together upon that handsome
privilege of reciprocal respect and de?
fense."
Detailed plans for strengthening
the army and navy and the aviation
corps and for making munitions and
armament by, the government were
outlined.
An hour before the president was
dve to speak the galleries of the audi?
torium were filled. The main floor
seats were taken long before he came
on the stage and many were turned
away. The rousing welcome with
which Chicago greeted his arrival was
echoed in the cheers of the crowds
about the building as the presidential
party came In.
Mayor Thompson of Chicago occu?
pied a seat on the stage near the pres?
ident and Gov. Dunne of Illinois was
in a box.
The entrance of the president was
he.aided by the playing of "The Star
Spangled Danner." The crowd stood
