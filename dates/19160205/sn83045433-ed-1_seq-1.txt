REFERENDUM
SEEMS LIKELY
Rider Planned for Sheppard
Bill Expected to Have Ma
jority of Two Votes.
COUNTRY SENDS PROTESTS
AGAINST INTERFERENCE
Senators and Members of House Re
ceive Thousands of Letters De
nouncing Prohibition Measure.
By JOSEPH p. ? If 7T??
? prominent southern Democrat In the
Senate yesterday declared that he be
lieved the Sheppard prohibition bill would
go through the ?Senate with a referendum I
rider attached. This statement was made !
after a poll which showed a majority !
of only two votes In favor of the ref- j
erendum proposal. The narrowness of ?
this margin may be more fully appreciated,
when tt is considered tbat the vote on
the bill will not come for days and pos
sibly weeks and that. In the meanwhile,
prohibition forces are using every known ;
political weapon from personal entreaty
to identic letters from hundreds of "the
folks back home." dictated by one mind j
and for one purpose.
Concert of action haa been determinad
upon by the leaders who will support a
referendum proposai- A conference of
these senators, including Senators Hard
wick. Blair Lee, Underwood and others, :
will be arranged shortly after Mr. Un
derwood returns from the South. Each
of the three senators named has mapped j
out a tentative form for the referendum
amendment. Senator Hardwick favors a
blautet provision which would leave to
the District Commissioners the Job of,
designating and assembling the machinery
and supervising the ballot. Senator Lee
favors adapting the Maryland law, while
1 Senator Underwood contemplates a meas- ?
I ure which would call for a triennial ref
erendum on prohibition.
j That the country Is protesting against
the radical and un-American attempt to
jam the prohibition bill down the throats
of the citizens of the National Capital
without offering them an opportunity to
express a preference is shown by the tele
grams addreessed to Senators and Mem
bers of the House which have poured into
Washington by the thousands. Senator
Harding, of Ohio, admitted yesterday
that he had received upwards of I.?00,
telegrams and letters from constituents1
protest.ng a.gainet the Sheppard bill. Rep
; resentative Lobeck, a member of the
House District committee, also has heard
I from his district, which embraces Omaha.
Representing 235 wholesale and retail
? druggists of the city, letters and peti
! tions are pouring into members of Con
gress protesting against the commercial
alcohol restrictions ln the Sheppard bill.

OLD TREATIES RELIED UPON
German Prize Crew Commander
Probably Will Be Permitted to
Keep Vessel at Port.
A formal request from the British gov
ernment that the United States release
the steamer Appam. now at Newport
News, in accordance with the principle
of International law expressed in Article
21 of the Hague convention of 1907 was
presented to the State Department yes
terday by Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, the Brit
ish Ambassador.
Though described ln British embassy
circles as a respectful demand, officials
of the State Department, who examined i
the written communication, described lt
as being merely a suggestion that the
United States consider the Hague con-;
vention in deciding the final disposition
of the captured British liner.
In presenting the request the British
government, it is understood, takes the \
position that while Great Britain did not
subscribe to the article ln question, nev
ertheless the artici? itself expresses the '
latest principle of international law and
lc ln accordance with the position gen
erally assumed by Great Britain sine* ?
1861, when a Queen's order In council
was Issued prohibiting any belltgerents
from bringing their maritime prize? into
British purts.
I.a*w*d un Old Treaties.
State Department officials mad? tt
piai* yesterday that ??spite the British
memorandum th**' "United States will
probably decide to permit the German
prize crew commander to retain posses
sion of the vessel and to keep It in the
American port, basing the decision on
the Prussian-American treaty ot 1799 ?as
modified by the treaty of 1828. What the
department has not decided ls whether,
under this treaty, the German command
er Is entitled to an Indefinite asylum for
his prize.
Although the United States subscribed
to Article -? of The Hague Convention,
officials of the State Department are in
clined to the view that Inasmuch as
Great Britain did not adhere to It, It ls of
no more binding effect on the United
States than a mere expression of the
contracting nations as to what the law
should be. They refuse to take the po
sition that it is more binding than the
special treaty between the United States
and Prussia.
Not until long after th!s treaty was
enacted In Its final form In 1S28, officials
say. did International law attempt to
place a time limit even on the stay of
belligerent warships in neutral ports.
The twenty-four-hour rule of the present
day, under which such warships may
visit a neutral port only once in three
months, and then for not more than
twenty-four hours, was unknown. The
same was true with regard to prize ships
in neutral ports.

Wilson's Demand Than Any Previous
Communication, Offering Indemnity

Text Withheld, But All Agree Situation Has Resolved Itsell
Into Question of Legality of Reprisals; President May
Await Return of Col. House.
Germany's answer to the last demands of the American govern
ment for a settlement of the Lusitania controversy was presented yee
terday afternoon to Secretary of State Lansing by Count von Bern
storff, the German Ambassador.
It falls short of the demands. It does not contain the, exact form
of disavowal demanded by the United States. It do? not acknowledge
that tlie attack on the I^usitania was illegal. But it does go further
towards meeting the demands than any communication heretofore pre
sented.
Whether it goes far enough to be made the basis of a ?ettlement,
or whether it is to be rejected and lead to a break in diplomatic rela
tions President Wilson must decide. The President returned to Wash
ington just a few hours before the conference between the Secretary
and the Ambassador.

Aa far aa could be learned the mem
orandum today doea not quite bridge
the difference* beta en the German and
American ?point of view, but ollera
to commit Germany to a statement of
regrets and an indemnity -agreement
which comes nearer thaa aver to
meeting the views of tha American
?government. In other worda. tt Is
stated, only a ? or d stand! la tba way
of a settlement.
The i***ue between th* TTnttad States
and Germany has retolvad Itself down
chiefly to the question whether or
not a reprisal la Illegal. German eon
tending that It is not and Secretar?
"Lansing asserting that It la. Tha be
lief expressed in many quarter* la taa'
Germany has proposed arbitration of
this question.
From tbe standpoint of persons In cloas
touch with the embaaay po.nt of view,
the Berlin government. It I* stated, haa
gone just ss far as she ?could with oeir
respect and with due conatd*rntloa for
popular feeling at home, to meet the
American demands.
According to the President * friends,
however, unless be gets ?Germany to ad
mit thst she committed an illegal act In
sinking the l^usitania without warning,
he will have failed to get full recog
nition of the fundamental principles of
international law and humanity upon
which he relies to set up again tbe rut*
of freedom of the oetir.
There Is a disposition In some quarters
to believe that the Ambaaaador may ?ret
be holding In reserve something addi
tional ?hich hi* instruction* might war
rant him ln giving.
Should the Prealdent decite to reject
the newest propoeal* from Great Britain,
it Is not believed in administration circles
that he will take any definite action
looking to a break until after the return
