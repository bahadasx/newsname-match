BRITAIN SENDS CURZON AND
HA1G TO KING ALBERT.
London, leb. 4.? An official communication, made public
to-night, smy ? that I art Curzon, Lord Prh y Seal, and
(ieneral Sir Douglas Haiti, commander of the British *lorces
on the Continent, are to proceed on a special mission to the
king of the Belgians, and that I. art Cur ion already has left
l.ngl?nd for that purpose.
Reports were current toward the end of last month that
fiermany had approached Belgium with the offer of a separate
peace. Berlin proposed to cede the occupied parts of Belgium
to King \lhert on condition that he observe a strict neutral?
ity, thus making any Allied invasion of fiermany through
Belgian territory impossible.
Larl Curzon, who is one of the most influential members
of the British Cabinet, may ha\ e been deputed by his col?
leagues to present the official British t /eu point on this pro?
posal.
