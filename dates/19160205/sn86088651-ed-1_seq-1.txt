The Colonial Theater was MM to
III capacity last night with an enthu
alaitlc audience composed of the rttl
tens of Rryan, College and the sur
rounding country In reRponte to the
call of Colonel Clarence Ousley for a
consideration of the administration
policy on preparedness. A (treat
many ladlet were In the audience.
I'nlll the meeting was more than
half over It appeared that harmony
would pre all and there waa nothlni
on the surface to Indicate but that the
entire audience waa heartily In favor
of indorsing the preaident in his flht
for preparedneu. llefore the clone ot
the meeting, however, opxslilon de
veloped and the meeting waa one of
the liveliest held In Hryan In lone
time.
The meeting waa called to order by
Colonel Ousley, who atated that Inas
much aa he had railed the meeting It
waa fit that he ahould give some ex
planatlon of Its Import. He did not
want to assume leadership In the mat
ter and ahould have consulted some of
his neighbor but was called away
from the city on other business and
did not have an opportunity to do so
He waa glad, however, one of the well
known rltliena of Texas was present,
a man of wide Information and an slile
speaker. Continuing Colonel Oualcv
ald with reference to the urgency.
tnat the people give expression to
their views that he had brought him
self to believe that the Russo-Japanese
war would le the last horrible ex
ample of that kind of strife, that com
merce and progresa in civilization
would restrain further blood shed and
bring about an era of arbitration for
the settlement of national difficulties
but In a night three quarters of the
civilised world had been plunged Into
war. And this conflict had upset all
our calculations and put to flight all
our vain philosophy. He referred to
ronditlona that may arise at the clone

solutely Imperative that we be thor
oughly prepared. Colonel Ousley
spoke further In part as'roilows:.
"It seems to me important at this
time for the clt liens of Texas to be
gin to express themselves on the pres
ident's policy of prerednesa. The
Impression prevails In Washington
that perhaps Texaa la not In favor of
any Increase In the army or navy. In
fsct. I think It aafe to say that pre
vlous to the wonderful campaign
which the president has Just con
eluded popular vote without discus
slnn would have been unfavorable to
any Increase in the army or navy. Hut
surely no man who has Informed him
self now questions the wisdom of the
policy proposed by President Wilson
In taking out Insurance of national
defense.
Evidence of Creat National Need.
"Whatever doubt the cltlxens may
have had. he la a stupid man who does
not recognise in thia extraordinary
action of the president In going be
fore the country as he Is now doing
the unquestioned evidence of the great
national need. It was my good for
tune to hear the president , In New
York a week ago tonight, and I could
not fall to appreciate the significance
of this remark: 'Our International
relations may not be so eaceful to
morrow.' He paused at that point
most Impressively and said. M use to
morrow' hi the literal meaning of the
word.'
"Plainly he sees dangers which the
average citizen cannot perceive be
cause he Is In a position to perceive
them. Undoubtedly the president has
knowledge of delicate developments
now pending which may prevent him
from keeping peace without the sacri
fice of honor. I am not alarmed, be
cause he is not alarmed: but as he Is
serious. It seems to me that patriotic
and thoughtful cltlxens ought to take
him seriously.
"I believe that congress will adopt
his program, but we will greatly
strengthen hla hands If. as groups of
cltlxens. we will now speak our minds
on thla Important subject If we agree
with him. we owe It to him to say so.
Therefore I think It becoming for the
cltlxens of Texas, regardless of party
alignment, to hold puMIc meetings
and give expression to their opinions
"I do not mean unduly to criticise
our members of congress who are hes
itating to express themselves on the
subject, but I mean only to call the
attention of cltlxens to their right to
be heard, and I believer In the pres
ent emergency It Is their solemn duty
to make thetnselvevs heard.
"There need be no fear that this
country will drift Into militarism. Our
democracy Is too deeply woven Into
the very fabric of our being, but there
Is need for greater military strength,
nV so much In the standing army, but

"I have all the time been a strong
advocate of building np our navy un
til It w ill be equal to and able to cope
with that of any other nation In the
world. In my platform announcing
for the senate I make thla declara
tion: "I am not In favor of a big army,
but we do need a atrong navy to cope
with others on the high seaa and to
protect our seacoast from the Invasion
of a hostile army. I do not believe
we ahould encourage militarism or
have a standing army of from 400.000
, to 600.000 men. However. I am In
favor or Increasing the efficiency of
thl state militia In each of the states,
and giving them proper recognition

"I am In favor of a campaign or

the minds or our school children and
people generally that a spirit of cour
age should accompany the spirit or

"I think that we ought to have dis
ciplined Mexico for trampling upon the
rights ot our people sojourning In thst
republic, for the damages that have
been done and the outragea upon wom

large army to accomplish this need.
Disciplinary measures will have to be
