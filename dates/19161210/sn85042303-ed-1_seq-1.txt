NOTE OF THE '
TRAVELING MAN SEES WONDER
FUL PROGRESS AND NOTES
A GREAT CHANGE IN THE
CITY'S APPEARANCE.
"It is perhaps harder for persons
who live in Arduinre to realize what
changes have taken place, and to
what extent the city has grown since
the terrible disaster of a little over
a year ago. than one who simply calls
at the town once a year." said a
traveling man for a big eastern con
cern yesterday. ,
"I was in Ardmore a few days af
ter the disaster." continued the trav
eling man, "and to me It seemed
that the stricken city should never
recover from the terrible blow.
"I!ut now if you look at Ardmore,
and talk about it, you will be doing
what they are now doing nil over
the country, and it Is the settled be
Ibf that Ardmore Is destined to be
come a big city.
"And why not? Ardmore is situated
i.t a logical point for a big city. The
Immense oil fields and railroad facili
tiesnot forgetting the push of the
Ardmore citizen lias made the Ard
mt re of the present, and you still
have Immense asphalt beds, glass
sand, brick clay and a chance for
limitless water power a few miles
to the nortli to generate countless
kilowatts of electricity for manufac
turing purposes. And more than
thiit, you have men in Ardmore with
money who are alive to these pros
pects, and who are going to it as
I fast as possible.
"With your new six story hotel,
the six story office building, the new
theatre, the toll road and other im
provenunts promised this coming
year, Ardmore twelve months hence
will look more and more metropoli
tan. Ardmore, in my opinion, is Just
bt ginning, and is certainly destined
to become a great city, and the home
of men who will bo known rrom
coast to coast for their part In the
big affairs which go to make up the
whole of this great country of ours."

THREE MEN WHO HELPED JO,
BUILD A LIVE TOWN IN TILL-
MAN COUNTY WILL HELP TO I
BUILD TOWN HERE.
"I never made any quick and good
money in my life but one time," said
Dr. J. A. Humphrey of Knid yester
day, "and that was when I moved to
Tipton when that town started and
helped to build it." Dr. Humphrey
was here from Knid on his way to the
llealdton oil fields to look over the
new townsite which Jake L. Hamcn
will sell in a short time. When Dr.
Humphrey was boosting Tipton there
were two other. Ardmore people
boosting the town at the same time.
They are J. W. Tipton, superintendent
of the O. N. M. & P. road and M. L.
Austin who Is a conductor on the
same line of road. Mr. Tipton built
the Wichita Falls and Northwestern
railroad that extends from Wichita
Falls to Forgan, Okla. The town of
Tipton" was named for his oldest son,
John E Tipton, and it grew Into
one of the best towns to Its slie In
the entire state. Tipton is located
sixteen miles northwest of Frederick
in Tillman unty. The other man
of Ardmore who was helping to build
the town was M. U Austin, who is
now a conductor on the O. N. M. & H.
Dr. Humphrey has made his plans
to locate in the new town on the very
first day that the sale of lots begins
and besides establishing an office for
the practice of medicine he will also
put in a stock of nierchandies. These
three men will for the second time
have their interests Joined in the
building of a ne- town in Cart-r

CM ITS THE DIPLOMATIC RECEP
TION ON ACCOUNT OF THE
WAR NEW YEAR'S RECEPTION
IS ALSO OMITTED.
Washington. Dec. ID. The pro.
program for the White House winter
social season has been announced and,
aM as generally expected, It omits
the colorful reception, because of the
war, and also the time honored New
Year's reception for the public, In ac
cordance with the custom I'rcsidont
Wilson set when coming Into oflice.
In place of the diplomatic reception,
there will be two diplomatic dinners.
The Kntente diplomats and all neu
trals will be entertained at the first
and the Teutonic diplomats and all
neutrals will be guests at the second.
The embarrassments which would.
be caused by Inviting the representa
tives of the warring powers to rub
elbows at the same reception may bo
more Imaginary than actual, but they
are regarded by the social managers
as having possibilities, notwithstand
ing that it is said (lie amlmssadnr
from one of the principal F.ntente Al
lies and the ambassador from ore of
the principal Teutonic powers alwjy
exchange courteous greetings when,
they pass on the street. However,
the program has been arranged U
keep the warring diplomats apart.
The social events all come on Tues
days Instead of Thursdays, as for
merly; the season begins earlier aid
ends in February Instead) of March,
probably due to the fact that th
White House wants It orer by Inaugu
