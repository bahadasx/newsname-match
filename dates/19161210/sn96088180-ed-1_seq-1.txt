ing Between the Forces
1 Kl Paao, Dec. t. Fighting between
VllllHtaa'and Mexican government
troops was In progress early today
near Fresno only 10 miles from Chi
huahua City. During the night Gen
eral Margin, Carransista commander,
hurried reinforcements to the relief
of General Oxuna's column of cav
alry which hud started in pursuit of
the bandits after the evacuation of
Chihuahua City and had fallen into
a VlUista trap, according to Informa
tion received here by mining men
and United States department of
ficials. -
Oiuna was enticed Into a trap early
yesterday near Santa Ysahel by the
VUllstaa. His forces were attacked
and driven back toward the capital.
Near Fresno, Osune halted to make
a atand against the bandits, mean
time asking Murgla to hurry relief.

men were scattered In heavy bodies
all along the Mexican Northwestern
railway from Santa Vsabet Westward.
Villa himself Is making hie head
quarters at Bustlllo. ; they aay. , t
The present engagement is not tak
en by military men; to mean that
Villa intends to make another as
sault upon the northern capital, but
merely to hamper eerloua pursuit by
government troops. In military
quarters here there Is much specula
tion over Villa's next move.
Another report reached United
States agents here early today that
the column of Carranxlstas, sent in
pursuit of the bandit 'has returned
o Chihuahua City, after marching
out eight miles. (i, , . ..
New lines of trenches and wire
