STORIESJF ACTION
In Letter to E. W. Stephens
Roosevelt Gives Names of
Favorite BooksT
WRITES IT HIMSELF
Former President Doesn't
Like "Abou Ben Adhem" ;
Prefers Scott's Novels.
The chief recreation that E. W.
Stephens has is reading. With his
.publishing plant, the building of the
new state capitol and various other
activities, bis time for reading, how
ever, is limited. So a short time ago
he wrote to Theodore Roosevelt ask
ing him to advise him on what are
the best books for a busy man. He
asked for advice on Doetry, fiction,
bibliography, travel and adventure.
Mr. Roosevelt replied almost imme
diately to Mr. Stephens in a letter of
two pages in his own hand-writing.
Like that of many great men, Colonel
Roosevelt's hand-writing is not the
easiest to read, but in the books
recommended is reflected the strenu
ous life of the writer. That the he
roes of 'the books and poems named
are the true ideals of the man from
Oyster Bay and that he has tried to
make himself like them is evident in
his selections. Nearly all are rugged
stories of adventure and exploration,
of fighting men and bold travelers,
with a few political tales to add spice.
Here is the letter in full.
"Dear Mr. Stephens,
"I am very busy but I can't re
sist the appeal you make and send
you a few lines.
"I never made that remark
about Abou Ben Adhem'; I care
for that poem only mildly.
"In poems of action: Take
Longfellow's 'Saga of King Olaf
indeed all 'The Tales of a Way
side Inn'; Tennyson's 'Ulysses';
Browning's 'Childe Roland to the
Dark Tower Came'; the. first two
books of Milton's 'Paradise Lost';
Drayton's 'Agincourt'; Scott's
'Marmion' and ail his ballads;
Julia Ward Howe's 'Battle Hymn'
which is healthy reading for
Americans at this time. Novels:
Cooper's 'Pilot,' "Two Admirals,'
'Spy' and 'Pathfinder'; Scott's
'Antiquary,' 'Guy Mannering,'
'Rob Roy, 'Waverly,' 'Ivanhoe,'
'Quentin Durward,' '(in both
Scott and Cooper skip most of
the part about the heroines');
Thackeray, 'Pendennis,' 'Phillip,'
'Vanity Fair,' 'The Newcomes;
Dickens' 'Mutual Friend," 'Tale of
Two Cities,' 'Nicholas Nicklefy,'
'Pickwick; Owen Wister's 'Vir
ginian' and all his volumes of
short stories; Bunner's 'Short
Sixes'; all of Joel Chandler Har
ris; Owens' 'Voodoo Tales.'
"Other books: Hayer's 'Life of
John Hay'; Life of Cavour'; Liv
ingston's 'Missionary Travels';
Dana's "Two Years Before the
Mast'; Marco Polo's 'Travels';
Selous' 'Hunter's Wanderings or
Travel and Adventure'."
"Sincerely yours,
THEODORE ROOSEVELT."

make six speeches in two days and to
be the guest of the W. C. T. U., the
Federal Council of Churches of Christ
of America and the Temple of Israel.
The reporters cornered Bryan and,
between swallows of grapefruit, took
he following interview:
"Prohibition will be the big issue
of the next national campaign that
s, if it doesn't beat the campaign here.
I hope Democracy will espouse the
cause. It is too early to predict, but
not too early for hope. It is possible
that a prohibition amendment may be
ubmitted to Congress before spring.
"President Wilson's victory in the
recent campaign was very gratifying
to me, especially since it was gained
without the assistance of New York.
The country has been released from
.lie delusion that a presidential candi
date must be satisfactory to New York.
The peace sentiment was strong
enough to decide the voters of several
western states. Women and the Pro
gressives threw California to Wilson.
The Adamson Eight-Hour Law gained
many votes for Wilson."
