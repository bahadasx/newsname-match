Dec 9, n:12 p. m.) The latest rn- j

gurdlnu the Belgian labor problem ,

rious points ralscV by Secretary Grew
at the first interview as details in
methods of operation under the de- ;
portation order open to criticism or
objection. The first was thut the
measure, in many respects was being ;
applied indiscriminately, to the em- ;
Ploved as well as to the unemployed.
The chancellor declured that this was

that the employed would be left un

lieelamations t'j this end, it was de
clared, were ncted upon ami the de
ported persons involved have already
been returned or were returning to
their homes in Belgium.
It was further suggested that the
measure should not lie applied to the
heads of families, hut it was pointed
out that it was impossible to make a
general rule to this effect, as fathers
of families were often the ones
through whom destitution, in the ab
sence of steady work or steady wages,
was most seriously felt , but the chan
eellor promised a modification of the
order in eases of special hardship.
The third point was that employes
of tlie Belgian relief commission
should not he deported. This, of
course, "wax granted, as they were not
regarded as unemployed.
A fart hot- objection was lodged
against the arrest of Belgian officials
for refusing to deliver lists of unem
ployed. Discontinuation of this was
granted, but it is now pointed but that
complaints on that scope were largely
exaggerated, only one Belgian mayor
having been arrested for this reason,
while he already lias been set at lib
erty. The request for permission for neu
tral representatives to visit deported
workmen and for postal facilities for
deported men to correspond with their
families was granted.
In official (iiiarters Germany's po
sition is reflected to the correspond
ent of the Associated Press as fol
lows:

l sources, generalizing irom niuuuei .-,
'which are admitted to have occurred
and Ignoring the spirit in which, in
the chancellor's reply contends, the
German government is determined to
sinnlv the measure. To a certain ex

is incalculable."
