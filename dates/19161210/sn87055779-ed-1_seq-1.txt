Federal Grand j

Cost of Living
A - i lfe.J pre Servlrp
WASHINGTON. Dec. .. De
partment of jutice othciul an
rounced today that federal grand
juries at New York and Detroit,
probably at Cleveland and possibly
at Kansas City, Minneapolis and St.
Louis would conduct sweeping in
quiries into the high cost of living.
Indications are that several hundred
witnesses, including dealers in coal,
tailroad employes and dealers in
and producers of foodstuffs will he
examined.
Prank M. Sw acker, special assist
ant to the attorney general in the
government's prosecution of the
New Haven case, hau accepted the
department's commission to assume
charge of the grand Jury investiga
tion at New York and probably will
start the inquiry early next week.
The inquiry at Detroit probably will
begin next Wednesday or Thursday.
Huge Amount Stored.
Information relating to the activ
ities of dealers, producers and others
believed to have contributed to the
upward trend is pouring into the
department in great volume. The
agriculture department tonight
made public figures it has supplied
the investigators relating to the
amount of certain meat foodstuffs
held i.i refrigerating plants. Their
figures, while not complete, indicate
that the plants are carrying more
foodstuffs at present than they had
in their rooms a year ago. The in
cated increase this year over last,
by percentages, follows: Frozen
t eef, 1 per cent; cured beef. 6S per
cent: frozen pork, HI per cent; dry
salt pork, 4." per cent: sweet pickled
pork, ?? per cent; lard, 17 per cent;
frozen lamb and mutton, 21 per
cent, and unclassified products, 34
per cent.
Hecause of the press of other bus
iness, I'res't Wilson did not see
George W. Anderson of Boston, the
United States attorney in charge of
the investigation, as it was thought
he would today. Mr. Anderson
probably will call at the white houso
Monday before his departure, late
that day. for Chicago.
The president is continuing his
study cf reports of the investiga
tors. Ask AYhes to Co-oiKMiite.
Mr. Anderson tonight requested
co-operation of housekeepers in hi
work to the extent that they refrain
from purchasing, so far as possible,
articles of food that have reached
the highest peaks in the new high
level of prices, and substitute cheap
er commodities. A reduction in the
amount of the highest pr'ced com
modities bought by the nation's
housevvi(s. it was pointed out, even
if small in individual cases, wohTd
make an aggregate slump in the
demand which could not fail to
bring prices tumbling in the articles
affected.
In addition it was pointed out that
what the district attorney termed
the great American habit of wasie
fulness, if intelligently checked,
would result in reduction of the de
mand and a lower level of prices.
"The American people." Mr. An
derson said, "need an eleventh

SAN ANTONIO, Tex., Dec. 9.
Major Gen. Frederick Funston, com
manding the department of the -outh
tonight, replied to the Hew J. .
Gambrelt, sec retary of the executive
board of the Haptist general conven
tion, explaining the general's reason
for not permitting' revivals In the
military camps here and alontr the
border. Numerous Haptist conven
tions have adopted resolutions con-J
demning what they understood to'
have been the general's actions, and
suggestions were made that ITcs't
Wilson, as commander in chief of
the army, be asked to take official
cognizance of the matter. A resolu
tion asking for information on the
controversy also has been introduced
in ccngress.
Ien. Funston gave out copies of
the letter to the press in which he
says in part:
"From time to time I have been
receiving copies of resolutions pass
ed by various Haptist bodies con-
demning my supposed stand rela
tive to holding religious services
among the troops on the border, and
also have received a number of very
unjust and in s-ome cases abusive let
ters from clergymen of the same
denomination. Incidentally, I mighty
say that I have had more letters
approving rny stand than I have
criticising It.
Denomination Not Noticed.
'This whole disagreeable incident
with all of its annoyance to me, of
course, arises from the statement
made by you after your visit to the
headquarters a couple of months afro
in which you sought to obtain per
mission tel conduct a series of re
vivals in the border camps. You
stated your business to Col. Harnum.
chief of staff. If Col. Harnum stated
at-that time what denomination you
belonged to, it made no impression
on my mind, and if he had, it would
have made no difference whatever.
"I told that officer to explain to
you fully that while religious ser
vices along the usual lines were con
ducted in the camps by chaplains
and other clergymen and were wel
come, I could not give my consent
to the holding: of revivals, therein,
qivin the word, as I was justified in
(loin?, its usually accepted meaning.
1 told Col. Harnum to explain to you
why revival services would be out of
place in a military camp, citing the
disgraceful performance in San An
tonio last winter as an example of
what revivals are apt to develop in
to, and drawing to a certain extent
on a general knowledge as to how re
vivals or 'protracted' meetings, as
they are some times called, are
usually conducted.
Soldier Not "Ixvst."
"I further instructed Col. Barn urn
to say o you that T did not accept
in fact resented the implication that
because a man had put on his coun
try's uniform. he was necessarily
lost, or worse than other men, that
I thought there were people who
had stayed at home, who needed re
vivals worse than the soldiers did.
Fnder the circcrmstances you
can imagine my astonishment when
I read your statements to the effect
that I had said that I would not al
low the soldiers to he told that they
were "lost. You must know as well
us I do that the doctrine that should
be preached to the men was never
once considered or mentioned and
with all due courtesy, I feel com
pelled to say that your making re
peatedly the statements you are
quoted as making was absolutely in
excusable and did me a grave injus

"'The only time the word "lost was
used by me was when I said that I
did not accept the vie A" that because
a man puts on his country's uniform
lie was necessarily lost. I say
frankly that I would not want to
take chances on allowing a series
of iei ils or protracted meetings
in these great camps. I am justified
in giving the word revival it usually
accepted meaning a series of meetr
ings continuing day and night for an
indefinite periol with long exhorta-
tation and singing and much emo-1
tionalism. f ' How about the!

an Lloyd George, Andrew Bonar ;

arid Arthur Henderson. Lord Mil

folio and Lord Curzon, lord privy

A. J. Balfour probably will follow
the example of Viscount Grey in
taking a title to enable him to be
spokesman for the foreign office in
the house of lords, while Lord Rob
ert Cecil will continue to represent
the department in the house of com
mons. None of the liberal members
of Mr. Asquith's cabinet will hold
office under the new prime minister.
After the publication of the full
cabinet the next important proceed

that Lloyd Gee will make a
speech outlining the policies of his
administration and the new minister
will be asked many questions con
cerning conditions in Greece and
on other vital matters.
The new war council is consider
ed an extremely strong body. Lords

The advance in the price of milk
on the part of the producers has
been expected for some time. At
the meeting of the national confer
ence in regard to the marketing
of farm products held in Chicago
last week, it was shown that the
price of milk is being raised all over
the country. Only last week the
Dairymen's association of Misha

by 2 cent to IS cenU a gallon,
causing the dealers of that city to
likewise advance the price to 8
cents a quart.
