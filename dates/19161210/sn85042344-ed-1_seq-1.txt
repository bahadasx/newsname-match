8AN ANTONIO, Texas, Dec. t.
Major General Frederick Funston,
commanding the department of the
south, tonight replied to the Rev. J.
& Gambrell, (secretary of the executive
board of the Baptist general conven
tion, explaining the general's reason
for not permitting revivals In the mil
itary camps here and along the bor
der. Numerous Baptist conventions
have adopted resolutions condemning
what they understood to have been
the general's action and suggestions
were made that President Wilson, as
commander-in-chief of the army, be
asked to take official cognisance of
the matter. A resolution asking for
Information on the controversy also
has been Introduced In congress.
General Funston gave out copies of
the letter to the press today and in
it he says in part:

"From time to time 1 have been re

by various Baptist bodies condemning
my supposed stand relative to holding
religious services among the troops on
the border, and also have received a

of the same denomination. Incident

business to Colonel Barnum, chief of
staff. If Colonel Barnum stated at
that time what denomination you be

my mind, and If he had It would have
made no difference whatever. I told
that officer to explain to you fully
that while religious services along
the usual lines were conducted In the
camps by chaplains and other clergy
men and were welcome, I could not
give my consent to the holding of re
vivals therein, giving the word, as I
was Justified In doing, 1U usually ac

"I told Colonel Barnum to explain
to you why revival services would be
out of place In a military camp, citing
the disgraceful performance in San
Antonla last winter as an example of
what revivals are apt to develop Into,
and drawing to a certain extent on a
general knowledge as to how revivals
or 'protracted' meetings, as they are
some times called, are usually con
ducted. I further Instructed Colonel
Barnum to say to you that I did not
accept In fact, resented the Impli
cation that because a man had put on
his country's uniform he was neces
sarily lost or worn than other men:
"that I thot there1 were people who

Whether Germany's reply will bo

department Is conscious that It al

bounds of diplomacy In making sev
eral Informal as well as formal repre

to emphasize its position In every rea

President Wilson are yet to bo laid

Deportation Continues.
Official Information shown that de
portations are continuing, and It Is the
opinion here thai whatever modifica
tions the Oormuns may have put Into
practice, the obnoxious principle of de
portations remains virtually unaltered
Some of the statements reported to be
contained In the German reply differ
widely from the official Information
reaching the department, especially as
to the severity with which the depor
tations are being carried out. The de
partment has been convinced that the
employed and those of independent
means have been taken Indiscrim
inately with the unemployed and the
dependent.
Officials do not desire to enter Into
a long argument with Germany as to
details and are satisfied with the ac

was ready to go ahead with that as a
basis If it were decided to take fur

a board of judges, who would grade
the cities and towns according to a
fixed schedule touching water supply,
sewerage, drainage, heat, light,
