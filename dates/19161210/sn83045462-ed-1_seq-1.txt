No. 612?No. 29.528. WASHINGTON, D. C., SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 10, 1916* FIVE CENTS.
LOCAL PENNY POST
IS PROVIDED IN BfLL
Post Office Measure Also In
eludes Zone Rates on Second-Class
Matter.
APPROPRIATES $327,000,000
One-cent postage for local first-class
mail deliveries, and a zone system of
rates for second-class matter, which is
expected to greatly increase the charges
for magazines and other periodicals having
a nation-wide circulation, are provided
for in the annual post office appropriation
bill as virtually completed yes
terday in committee. The measure, carrying
appropriations totaling about
$327,000,000, probably will be reported
to the House next week.
I'nder the one-cent postage provision
the rate on letters and other mail matter
, of the tirst class, when deposited in any j
post office, or branch post office, or letter
box or post office in the delivery dis- j
tClct, for delivery within the limits of
the post office, city or rural delivery district,
would be cut in half.
The zone proposal for handling newspapers
and magazines, which now pay a
flat rate of 1 cent a pound, is regarded
ns one of the most radical changes in
postage rates in years. It divides the
country into eight zones, with rates
chargeable ranging from 1 cent for 300
miles to 6 cents for 1,800 miles or more.
The bulk of daily newspapers, the committee
believes, will not be affected, because
they do not circulate beyond a
300-mile radius. The provision follows:
Zone Rate for Publications.
"That all newspapers, magazines and
other publications regularly admitted
to the mails as matter of the second
class, when mailed by the publisher,
shall hereafter be subject to the following
rates of postage, the zone system
now applying to parcel post matter
to be adapted also to second-class
matter.
"Local, first, second and third zone
(under 300 miles). 1 cent per pound.
"Fourth zone (300 to 600 miles), 2
cents per pound.
"Fifth zone (GOO to 1,000 miles), 3
cents per pound.
"Sixth zone (1,000 to 1,400 miles), 4
cents a pound.
"Seventh zone (1,400 to 1,800 miles), 5
cents a pound.
"Eightn zone (over 1,800 -miles), 6
cents a pound.
"Provided, that free-in-county circu'
lation provided by law shall continue
as at present.
"The Postmaster General shall have
' authority to require publishers to separate
their mail into zones when offered
for mailing."
Higher Bates for Catalogues.
Among other provisions, the bill increases
rates for mail order catalogues
from 2 to 8 cents a pound, making
them third-class matter, instead of
parcel post; raises the limitations on j
promotions of clerks and carriers in |
first and second class pest offices: broad- {
ens the Postmaster General's authority
to deal with lotteries. drugs and !
poisons, and increases the rural mail
delivery appropriation by $4,000.GOT) over
the $49,000,000 recommended by Assistant
Postmaster General Blakeslee.
Chairman Noon of the postoffice
committee said last night that the bill
Btill was subject to change before being
reported, and that the question of hearings
on the proposed pneumatic tube
service appropriation was in abeyance.

Socialist in Prussian Diet Attacks
Those With Huge War Profits.
AMSTERDAM, December 9. via Londop.?In
the course of a discussion in
th<* Prussian diet on the question of an
increase in the salaries of minor offi.
cials, the socialist deputy. Stroebel. according
to the Vorwaerts, attacked
those who were receiving great war I
profits while the mass of the people
were starving.
The deputy quoted the cases of minor
railway officials who were not only on
short commons, hut were suffering
from hunger, their income not being
sufficient to buy their allotted amount !
? of food. The speaker concluded:
"We long for and hope for any peace i
mediation in the interest of the official

PARIS. December 9.?A commission
named by forty-three groups of the
theatrical profession In Paris decided
today to protest against the proposals
of the minister of the interior to restrict
further the lighing of places of {
amusement, to close playhouses on an
additional day and to impose a sup- j
plemental tax of 20 per cent on their !
receipts.
The commission points out that, add- i
#>?! to the contributions to the poor
fund and royalties to authors, the new
tax would bring up to 45 per cent the
amount taken .from the receipts of
theaters, and declares that to close the
playhouses two days a week would be
a great hardship for the 80,000 persons
in France who gain their livelihood on
the stage.
In place of the proposals of the Interior
department the commission
suggests that considerable economies
may be effected by changes in the
lighting of stages and auditoriums.

BERUN TO GO FAR
TOMEETU.S.WISHES
Reply in Regard to Belgian Deportations
Will Be in
Friendliest Terms.
POSITION IS MADE PLAIN
By the Associated Pf*ess.
BERLIN, December 8, via London,
! December 9.?The latest representai
tions by the United States reg'ardinp
j the Belgian labor problem were presented
by Joseph C. Grew, secretary
of the American embassy, In an interview
with Chancellor von BethmannHollweg
on Tuesday, and the German
reply is expected to be delivered tomorrow
or Monday.
Like the chancellor's reply to Secretary
Grew's first representations, it
I will be couched in the friendliest
I terms, going, it is understood, as far
I as possible toward meeting American
| wishes and recognizing the interest the
j United States naturally takes in this
I question, as the power chiefly con|
cerned in the work of Belgian relief.
! As showing the spirit in which Germany
inet the first American representations,
the Associated Press correspondent
today was informed that it was
only necessary to recapitulate the
chancellor's answers to various points
raised by Secretary Grew at the first
interview as details in methods of operation
under the deportation order open
to criticism or objection.
Some Returned to Belgium.
The first was that the measure in
many respects was being applied indiscriminately
to the employed as well
as to the unemployed. The chancellor
declared that this was contrary to the
wishes or intention of the government; !
that only the really unemployed would j
be taken; that the employed would be
left unmolested and that wherever errors
have occurred the sufferers from
them would be returned to Belgium.
Reclamations to this end, it was declared,
were acted upon and the deported
persons involved have already |;
been returned or were returning to i j
their homes in Belgium.
It was further suggested that the I
measure should not be applied to the j ]
heads of families, but it was pointed i
out that it was impossible to make a <
general rule to this effect, as fathers
of families were often the ones through <
whom destitution, in the absence of ;
steady work or steady wages was most i ]
seriously felt, but the chancellor prom- <
ised a modification of the order in j '
cases of special hardship. J;
Belief Commission Safe.
The third point was that employes of ?
the Belgian relief commission should j
not be deported. This, of course, was
granted, as they were not regarded as
unempl*y?dt A.further protest was lodged
against the arrest of Belgian officers
after refusing to deliver lists of. unemployed.
A discontinuance of this was
granted, but it is now pointed out that
complaints on that score were largely
exaggerated, only one Belgian mayor
having been arrested for this reason,
while he already had been set at lib- \
erty.
The request for permission for neutral
representatives to visit deported i
workmen and for postal facilities for i
deported men to correspond with their t
families was granted and repr^senta- <
tives of the Spanish embassy will have '
the first opportunity to visit the work- i
ing places, because Spain is the official
representative of Belgian interests. |
This reply left only one objection re- <
m&ining to methods of application un- i
answered?the one referring to heads
of families.
Germany's Position Reflected.
In official quarters Germany's position
is reflected to the correspondent of
the Associated Press, as follows:
Over and over again it has been reiterated
here that the United States and
the neutral world in general seem to
have a distorted picture of the Belgian
UTJ7UI I JVI'JII JUCSUVII, IIICII V1CWS .
on information from enemy sources, Ken- T
eralizing from blunders which are ad- i 1
milled to have occurred, and ignoring . }
the spirit In which, as the chancellor's ' '
reply contends, the German govern- '
ment is determined to apply the mean- I (
ure. To a certain extent, at least, it is j 1
represented, the reasons leading the 1
government to put the measure into j
effect have been misunderstood.
Reference also is made to the mili- 1
tary aspects of the question. Not the 1
least of these considerations it is said ; 1
is the ever-present possibility of an .
attempt at the landing of a military | '
force in Belgium, in which case a dan- j !
gerous menace to the German troops ; ,
would be presented by the presence in the J
field of operations and the immediate rear i 1
of the German defenses of a Large assem- I*
blage of aide-bodied adults who already ; ;
have shown a disposition to make trouble. : J
As is usually the case in war, military j 1
reasons prevailed.
Held Without Foundation.
j'
As to the allegation that deported j
workmen would be forced to labor on ! '
munitions work it is asserted in official
quarters that there is not the
slightest foundation therefore. As a
matter of fact, Germany is now obtaining
all the workmen needed for
this purpose.
An official, who explained the gov
ernment's position in this regard re- {
ferred repeatedly to the earlier declarations
that deported workmen under j
1 no circumstances would be employed in !
war work or forced to labor against j
I their own country. Furthermore, it is j
said that all the earlier corners to
| Germany are satisfied with their con- j
ditions of employment and their high
> pay. and Belgians who still remain in j
1 their own country arc quoted as de- i
I daring that the meas ire is desirable ;
i in tl e interests of unemployed work!
men and the remaining population.
The protest based on the promise to ;
j the Dutch consul at Antwerp just after j
: the surrender of the city, that Belgians j
; would not be deported. Is being seri- I
ously considered. While the obligation I
was assumed under the universal supposition
In Germany that the war j
would be over In a few months and I
that it was impossible that such condi
tions as exist today should arise, the obligations
still exists, and certain concessions
may be made to meet this situation.

OH) USUAL JEST '
AT GRIDIRON DINNER
"Skits" Put On by Club Last
. Might Merrier Than at
Former Affairs.
POLITICS PLAY BIG PART
Probably all the guests at the Gridiron
Club's dinner, held at the New
Willard Hotel last night, took it for
granted that there would be some play
upon the manifold and surprising inci- j
dents of the recent campaign and election.
They were not disappointed, but
it is doubtful if any of them anticipated
one event of the evening, which
went beyond the usual jest and satire
of the "skits" put on by the club, and
invested the proceedings with patriotic
significance at that particular stage.
It came about in this way. In the
course of the dinner the stage was set
as if for a boxing bout?boxing gloves,
trainers' towels and all that sort of
thing. Everybody looked around arid
wondered what was coining off. To
their surprise, up from the guests'
table came Frederick B. Lynch, democratic
national committeeman, from
Minnesota; Representative Doremus of
Michigan, chairman of the congression
al campaign committee, and Senator
Walsh of Montana, manager of the
western headquarters of the democratic,
national committee, who took places
in one corner of the ring, as seconds
in the com:rig bout.
Then, to the other corner came also
from the guests' tables A. T. Hert,
manager of the republican western
headquarters; Frank H. Hitchcock of
the republican national campaign committee
and James B. Reynolds, secretary
of the republican national committee.
Following them came William R.
Willeox and Vance McCormick, managers,
respectively, of the republican
and democratic national campaign.;,
who advanced to the center of the ring.
Through Fighting, They Say.
When the assembled company realized
that these were "the real people,"
and not club members made up to represent
them, a buzz of excitement ran
through the hall. The manager of the
prize fight introduced them as "the New
England terror" and ihe "heavyweight ?
champion of the south and west."
The two principals were made to I
clasp hands, the gong sounded and |
Lhe manager cried "Go to it." But the |
principals did not relax their handclasp,
and only smiled at each other.
The manager looked surprised, and,
ifter consulting with the principals,

As the hand played "America" the
intire company around the tables rose
to their feet, cheering and applauding,
while Mr. VVillcox and Mr. McCormick
tiarched off, arm in arm.
Jf the story of the dinner were to be'
told in consecutive order it would have
to begin with the entrance of President
Wilson, on the arm of President Louis
W. Strayer of the Gridiron Club, into the
beautifully decorated ballroom. fairly

Between the courses came the

devised by the hosts to make an evening
of merriment, interlarded with
satire and caustic comment, but devoid
of sting or animus. President ]
Wilson entered heartily into the spirit
of the occasion and laughed over the
hits at his own party and partisans as ;
well as the buffets very generously j
handed the opposition.
As it is the province of newspaper !
men to forecast coming /events, the
Gridiron Club antipicated by a year the 1
assembling of the Sixty-fifth Congress ;
and gave its guests an idea of how j
the next House might solve the problem
of organization. A moot House }
was assembled in the hall, including
democrats, republicans, one socialist, !
one progressive, one prohibitionist and
one independent. j
The democrats nominated Champ
Clark for Speaker, the. republicans
named James It. Mann, while Meyer ,
London nominated himself as socialist
candidate, suit being followed by one
man for the other parties. Mann and
Clark were tied on the roll call and "110
election" was the verdict. Then up
spake Augustus Gardner. ^
"I move that we have two Sneakers: *
let's elect both Mann and Clark."
"Fine," said "Nick" Longworth,
"Clark has never done anything in six
years without Mann's'approval."
"Better do it. Champ," put in Fitzgerald.
"He won't sting you so bad up
there." So the two speakers were
elected and took their places on the
Nostrum, while "Uncle Joe" Cannon was
tolled off to swear them in.
"Uncle Joe" Swears Them In.
"Hands up," sternly ordered "Uncle

Actual Consideration of Measure, at
However, Will Be Taken Up j J
Tuesday Probably. !
Salary raises for government em- s
ployes will be before the House of Rep- i
resentatives tomorrow, it is expected, f
as the appropriations committee in- t
tends to report the legislative, execu- ^
live and judicial appropriation bill. This ^
measure, carrying provisions for the
salaries of about 18,000 clerks, will provide
for the expenditure of about $39,000,000
for the fiscal year ending 1918. ;
When the committee on appropria- i
tioris meets tomorrow at 10 o'clock j j
Chairman Byrns of the subcommittee |
having: the legislative bill in charge! ,
will present his report, which will be )
complete in all details except the legis- i t
lative recommendations for a horizon- j j
tal increase in salaries and wages for j c
employes of the government. This sub-j c
ject will not be- decided until after the j ^
full committee has had a chance to <1 is- j r
cuss the measure and to weigh the s
various proposals lor a wage increase. g
Subcommittee Work Completed. v
The subcommittee work has been f
completed, and clerks of the committee x
worked all day yesterday and will work |
iernay in oruer to draw up the bill and { t
make the necessary mathematical cal- j r
culations. Copies of the bill will be j ^
rushed to the House tomorrow from > n
Lhe printing- office, and the bill itself 1 d
w ill be taken up soon, probably Tues- 1 v
day. n
Whatever plan for a horizontal increase
is agreed upon for the legislative
bill will point the way to plans
for wage-increases in other appropriation
bills. This includes the District ! c]
bill, the fortifications bill and the '
sundry civil bill. !11
The fight for.higher wages and sal- 11
aries is so close now that the end of v

will be granted, as there is but \ f'

"This whole disagreeable incident,
'ith all of its annoyance to me. of
ourse, arises from the statement made
?y you after your visit to the hcadiuarters
a couple of months ago, in
rhich you sought to obtain permision
to conduct a series of revivals
n the border camps. You stated your
usiness to Col. Barnum, chief of staff.
f Col. Barnum stated at that time
i hat denomination you belonged to.

nd if he had. it would have made no
ifference whatever.

vas justified in doing, its usuallv aoepted

xplain to you why revival services
vould be out of place in a military
amp, citing the disgraceful performance
in San Antonio last winter as
m example of v.hat revivals are ant tn
levelop into and drawing to a certain
xtent on- a general knowledge as to
low revivals or 'protracted' meetings,
is they are sometimes* Called, are usuilly
conducted. v *
"I further instructed iCo 1. Barnum to
ay to you that I -did not accept, in fact
esented, the implication that because
l man had put on his country's uni'orm
he was necessarily lost, or worse
han other men; that I thought there
.vere people who had stayed .it home
vho needed revivals worse than the
ioldiers did. * * *
"Doctrine Never Once Mentioned."
"Under the circumstances you can
magir.e my astonishment when I read
our statements to the effect that 1
lad said that I would not allow the
oldiers to be told that they were
lost.' You must know as well as I do
hat the doctrine that should be ,
ireached to the men was never once |
onsidered or mentioned and with all
lue courtesy I feel compelled to say !
hat your making repeatedly the state- j
nents you are quoted as making was
tbsolutely inexcusable and did me a I
jrave injustice.
"The only time the word 'lost* was I
lsed by me was when I said that 1 |
lid not accept the view that because |
l man put on his country's uniform he j
vas necessarily lost. * *
"I say frankly that I would not want i
o take chances on allowing a series of ;
evivals or protracted meetings in these j

Must Protect the Soldiers.
"How about the rights of the men who
o not want to attend revivals and who do
ot wish to be disturbed by them? Are
hey to be compelled to leave the camp,
irhich is their home, and wander about i
own town or through nelds to get aw;iy j
rom them? Has a man no rights be- j
ause he is a soldier? There are many ;
eligious people who disapprove strongly I
f revivals with their attendant emotion- i
lism. And, anyhow, be a man religious j
r irreligious, he he Christian, Hebrew or J
lohammeran. no other person has a right

"Soldiers must be protected from im- I

un fail in their duty, their only recourse j
i submission'or riot; and it is a safe)
uess that the latter is what you would |

Those Net Doing Army Service.
PARIS, December 9.?A special personal
war contribution has been added
to the taxes provided for by the appropriations
committee in a bill now
being discussed in the French chamber
of deputies. It is graduated on the
same principle as is the income tax,
from 20 per cent of the taxable portion
of incomes between 3.000 and 10,000
francs to 100 per cent of the taxable
oortion of incomes exceeding 50,000
francs.
.wUitinn fach ncrson liable to this
tax will pay a fixed arbitrary contribution
of 12 francs a year. This applies
to every person of a mobilizable age
and is to be paid from January 1, 1917,
until December 30 of the first year
after the cessation of hostilities.
The measure is intended to reach persons
who have not served at least two
years in the army or who have not
participated in the war in one of the
armies. All men at the front are exemptied,
as are those who nave been
mustered out on account of wounds or
illness.
TEIPEBS SISTEB ENDS STOBY.
Buffalo Defendant Accused of Mur?
der of Mother and Brother.
BUFFALO. N. Y., December 9.?The
testimony of Miss Grace J. Teiper in
the case of her brother, John Edward
Teiper. accused of the murder of his
mother and brother, was completed today.
The testimony was taken at the
Teiper home, and will be read to the
jury next week.
Guy B. Moore, district attorney; Edward
It. O'Malley. chief counsel for
Teiper; the referee and the family
physician were the only persons admitted
to the room. Mr. Moore's only
comment on leaving; the house was that
the testimony was "very satisfactory/*
The defense, it is understood, will depend
largely upon Miss Teiper's testimony
to sustain the theory that more
than $190 was taken from the bodies of
Mrs. Teiper and her murdered son
Frederick, and that the crime was committed
by a negro highwayman.
