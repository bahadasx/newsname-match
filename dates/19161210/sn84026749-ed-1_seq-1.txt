FIGHT STARTED
FOR MUNICIPAL
ABATTOIRHERE
Department of Agriculture Has
Approved the Plan for
Capital Plant.
WOULD CUT , MEAT PRICE
Present System Declared to
Discourage 'Farmers From
. Raising Beef.
Legists Hon toon la 'to be Introduced
In Congress for a municipal abattoir
In Washington. The plan already hss
received the approval of the Depart
ment of Agriculture.
It la contended that one reason why
meat la o high In cities Is that the
present system of marketing and dis
tributing meat Is under the control of
'the treat packers, and that farmer
within a short distance of large cities
are discouraged from raising and
marketing their beef.
Farmer Experience.
The case la cited of a "Maryland farm
r. about fifty mllrs from Washington.
I. who shipped a cow to the Capital, and
received for It Vi net, live weight
Later this farmer butchered a' smaller
cow on his own farm, and disposed of
the carcass to two merchants In a
small town near by, who retailed It at
profit. The farmer, by this process,
received for hie cow $18.11 as- follows :
One hind and one fore quarter,
103 .pounds, at 11 cents 17.03
One hind quarter, 80 pounds,
13 cents 1 0.60
One front quarter, retained at
home, 83 pounds, at 10 cents.., .8.30
Liver and heart, kept at home.
20 pounds, 10 cents.... i.;..V 3.00

Sold neck and brisket, 10-
pounds, 8 cents 80

, ' Percentage ef Output.
Including the tongue, and not
counting the weight of the hide, this
ow dressed at 300 pounds. A cow
will dresa from 40 to 63 per cent of
live weight.
Considering1 that this cow waa a
Jersey, and ony (average, CO per cent
of dressed meat from live weight
would be a fair allowance; making'
her Jive weight -79 potusds. -
'On the day this cow waa dlspesed
of the market price for cows, live
weight In Washington, waa from 2
to S cents, good -Ones belnr rated at
about 4 cents 4 pound. Allowing that
price for this cow, the gross returns
for her In Washington would have
been $38.80.
If aha had been purchased by the
local buyer who covera that section
(or the Baltimore and Washington
markets, aha would not have brought
more than $22.00.
Tho merchants who bought this
carcass set their own price to the
farmer, stating It waa a fraction be
low what they paid the Washington
distributing agencies pf the big pack
era.
Must Deal With Buyer.
Later this farmer and a neighbor
who had twenty-five head of .cattle to
dispose of. Including cowa and ateers,
tried toi.sell direct to buyera In Wash
ington, but they were met with the
answer that they must deal with the
buyer In their territory.
Municipal offlclaln were asked to
look Into the possibility of the estab
lishment of a municipal abattoir In
Washington.-
One District official who Investi
gated the matter, reported that retail
distributers In Washington had told
him they could afford to buy from a
municipal abattdlr In Washington
only on condition that this abattoir

JUST BACK FROM TOUR
Police Believe Robberies Com

The series of hold-ups and daring
robberies which has kept the local
police working day and night during
the past two months. Is the tall-end
of a wave of crime that Is .sweeping
all the large cities of the country,
In the opinion of Central Office De
tective Burlingame, who returned this
morning from a tour of tha East and
Middle West
"There Is an unusual amount of
'stick-up' work and. robbery going on
all over the country this winter," said
the detective, "but we're not getting
anything like aa much of It hare as
they are In other big cities."
relee Kept Boar.
Detective Burlingame says In New
Tork, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh. Cleve
land, and other cities, the police are
struggling wlth.an unusual number of
hold-ups by young white men.
Some of the other detectives who
have been at headquarters for years,
believe a number of the bolder type of
criminals are stopping in Washington
on their fay from other cities.
They point to the recent robbery of
10,000 worth of furs from an F street
furrier and the several receht safe
cracking jobs both unusual In Wash
ington aa edldence that the present
crime wave la In part due to thj pres
ence of strangers In the city.
Began la November.
The present wave of crime began
hare early In November, when Luther
A. Acker was held up at Tenth" and
Massachusetts avenue northwest by
two white men and robbed of 100.
This was followed by eight or ten
similar Jobs ad a score of daring cases
of housebreaking.
In Cleveland, Detective Burllngamo
said, the holdup men are working
wlth'sUteh'automoblles. They take a
ear, ha said, ride up to a business
place or to a men on a quiet street,
Sethis aspney and speed off to a near.

'"MaWuTlman and Elective Bur
llngeme, both expressed the belief
that the Increase In crime this winter
might be due In part to the high coil
or living.
Not Dae to Latter ghertage.
Detective Burlingame said, how.
ever, It could hardly be blamed on
the fact that the men who are re
sponsible for the crime are unable to
find work. Ha said that In some of
the cltlea he vlatted there la, on the
contrary, a shortage of labor.
Inspector Clifford Orant. chief of
the local detective bureau, pointed out

No trace of the man has been found.
A woman saw him running east in B

said the man's hair was too straight to
be that of a negro, lie said he also
noticed a peculiarity about the man's
lips that made him think hla assailant
was blackened for the occasion.
The man entered the laundry, asked
for change for a It bill. Suddenly he
drew a revolver, commanded him to

enclosure, took the money from the
drawer and backed out of the place,

of Individual Increases, applying to"
the higher-paid clerka and officials,

to the full committee the blanket

There Is practically no doubt that
the committee Intends to Increase sal

not been remiss In describing the ne

URGES IRON HAND

Seeks Compromise.
LONDON, Dec 10. No more delay
In dealing with Greece Is the cry of
the press here.
UThe report, from Athens thst Con
stantlns will Join -with Germany If
the allies break off negotiations with
him has stirred sentiment still fur
ther against any further palliation of
hla methods. .
It Is fairly well established that
the brother-in-law of the Kaiser de
liberately fomented the attacks on
Admiral Kournel's men.
Constantine, It Is now realised. Is
playing for time, and undoubtedly
plans to wait until Mackensen can
attack from thn north when he will
hurl the Grecian troops against the
rear of the allied forces. The Greek
king Is not expected to accede to
the allies' demand for the release of
1,600 Venlxellst adherents now held
prisoners.
The blockade In effect today comes
simultaneously with the mobilisation
by the King of 00,000 royalists.
Italy Berks Some CoMpreaala.
An Exchange Telegraph Company
dispatch from Athens, however, says
that .from the Information available
In Greece will be solved "In a con
ciliatory manner, calculated to satisfy
the requirements of the powers and
the dignity of Greece." The Italian
minister, the dispatch adds, Is busily
engaged on thla task.
Military experts agree that the next
military move by Berlin will be an
effort to retake Monastlr and drive
Oeneral Sarrall and hla 000,000 men
into the sea.
On the Roumanian fronts thn Oer
manic armlea continue to drive back
the Roumanian troops, now, apparent
ly, demoralised, while the efforts of
the Russians to relieve the pressuro
have been so far unsuccessful.
Mackensen'a use of armored cars
against Ferdinand's forces coused
great havoc and materially added In
the capture of men and guns. The
field marshal and his staff are now
occupying the royal palace.at Buchar-,
est, and already a German has been
appointed governor.
Little Activity On West.
On the western front there Is little
activity, although the aermans are
expecting an attack.
Much Indignation has been aroused
here by the reports that the Turks
are Inciting the Mohammedans In
Persia to slay the 70,000 Christians In
that country, using a holy war as a
justification. . , , , , .
Thla action of the Turks Is looked
upon as not much worse than the
Belgian deportations, which still con.
tlnue In spite of the protests of tho
civilized world.

POINTS TO CHEAP FOODS
Declares Must Resort to Ban
on All Products With In
flated Cost.
A nation-wide appeal to the people
of the United SUtes for a boycott
against speculators, aa tha most af
fective means of puncturing tha pres
ent Inflation of food prices, waa made
today by Oeorge W. Anderson, Special
Assistant Attorney General In charge
of the Federal food probe.
"Low priced foods.' he said, "which
are beyond the Influences of food
speculators; are 'to be had In greatest
abundance. The people must resort
to tsfsss."
It Is vastly more Important that
they do thla " Anderson said with
solemnity," than that we, as a result
of our Investigations, obtain convic
tions against certain speculators."
One weekof a. concerted food boy
cott against htfh-prlcad.fqods. would
knock the' very bottom out of prices.
Is the consensus of official opinion
here. ,
Coincident with the launching of a
nation-wide grand Jury Innutry Into
food speculation. President Wilson will
give persons! consideration thla week to
the question of curbing soaring prices
of food stuffs. ,
LegUtslion to force the relesae of cold
storage holdings la one of the remedies
the lresldent Is understood to have un
der consideration.
Coafereace Wllh Andersen.
President Vlleon tomorrow will out
line his Ideas of the course of action
he deems advisable In view of reports
now before him to Special Assistant
Attorney Genersl Anderson, In charge
of the food Investigation.
After hla conference with the Presi
dent. Mr. Anderson will leave for the
West to arrange for special grand Jury
Inveetlgatlons this week at Detroit and
Chlcage, and probably Kansas City,
Minneapolis, Cincinnati and Cleveland.
Itfte Yevk laejalry.
Frank M. Saracker, who proeeeuted
the New Haven case, will take charge
of the New Tork grafid Jury Investiga
tion. asV "aeBediiied to begtn this, week.
The. feci storage phase of the food
froblem was called sharply to the at
sntlon of. the President when the De
partment xt Agriculture submitted a
report showing tremendous Incresses
of frozen stocks and cured' meats In
packing houses and storage ware
houses on. December X as compared
with a year ago, . ,
In one Instance the Increase of hold
ings over a year ago reached 9S.8 per
cent.
' taereaae ef 13 Per Cent.
Firms reporting holdings of frozen
beef were shown to have 15,3to,87
p'ounds more on hand December 1
than on the same date last year an
Increase of 12 per cent.
On the same date there were 13,030,.
030 pounds triors cured beef, or an In
crease of 48.8 per cent.
Froien pork holdings had Increased.
0,814,483 pounds, or 31.4 per cent: dry
salt pork holdings 'hod Increased 38,
042,4x1 pounds, or 40.0 per cent.
Sweet pickled 'pork storage hold
ings showed an Increase of 33.T per
cent, lard an Increase of 47.0 per cent,
and frozen lamb and mutton holdings
21.3 per cent.
Greatest Evidence.
'The north central portions of the
country disclose the greatest evidence
of food' speculation, officials said. In
dicating that the Investigation cen,
tral In Chicago will be of the most
sensational character.
President Wilson already has ap
proved the grand Jury Inquiries as a
basis of prosecuting Individuals or
Interests concerned In the abnormal
food price Increase.
Prosecution of speculators, how
ever. Is only one part of the problem,
the President believes, and what Is
deemed of more Immediate necessity
Is the formulation or plans for check
ing soaring prices and reducing pres
ent abnormal prices.
Many Suggestions.
President Wilson haa received sug
geatlons of every kind from his Cabl
net advisers.
One department favored stimulation
of farm Industries, another education
of the middleman, so that he will not
be stampeded in situations such oj
now face the country.
The disclosure of mammoth cola
storage holdings of necessities of life,
raised the question of legislation io
release these products.
There Is almost unanimity of opin
ion among the President and.hls Cabi
net advisers, It Is understood, agaliut
an embargo on export of food aup
plles. bills to establish which are now
pending In Congress.
Urges Boycott.
Special Assistant Attorney Oeneral
Anderson has Issued a statement In
connection with his grand Jury In
vestigation plans urging housewives
to co-operate In the coat of llvlu-r
fight by refraining froih" purchasing
articles of food that reached the high
est peak in the new level of prices.
Rice, corn meal and other nutritive
but low-priced foods are urged by Mr,
Anderson as substitutes for the hlfili
priced articles of food he would hAVo
the nation's housekeepers boycott.

William L. O'Connell, chairmen of
