that they would not reach Germany,

here. The consignees in turn will

the paper read by Commissioner Howard
"E '.Williams of the state department

resources, and which gave the

has been doing along farming lines
and what is in prospect In this sec
tlon.
Mr. Williams declared that there
are a thousand farms in the state, the
averugo value of which is $3,255. He

.1. B. C.rv rbrel'. secretary ?f the cx|
ecutlve hjp'ard of the Baptist gonernl
convention. explaining the peneml's
reason for not permitting revivals In
the military camps here and along
the border. Numerous Baptist conventions
have adopted resolutions
condemning what they- understood to
, have been tlio general's action and
suggestions were made that Prosl,
dent Wilson, as commander in chief I
of the army, be asked to take official |
cognizance of the matter. A reHolutlorv !
asking for information on the coni
trovorsy also has been introduced In
Congress.
(jiv'S Ont cjqpiew.
i General Funston gave out copies
i of the le|ter to the press, in which ho
,says in part:
"Rrom time to time I hsve been re:
reiving copies of resolutions passed
; by various Baptist bodies condemning
my supposed stand relative to
; holding religious services among the !
troops on the border and also have
rr reived a number of very unjust and
in sprite cases abusive letters from
clergymen of the same denomination.
Incidentally I might say that I have
had more letters approving my stand
than I have criticising it.
. "This whole disagreeable incident
with all its annoyance to me, of
course arises from the statement!
j made by you after your visit to the
: headquarters a couple of months ago
in which you sought to obtain permission
to conduct a series of revivals
in the border camps.
Services Aro Welcome.
"I told an officer, to explain to you
fully that while religious services
along the usual lines were conduted
in the camps by chaplains and other
ciprgymen and were welcome, I could
not give my consent to the holding
of revivals, therein, giving the word,
as 1 was justified in doing, its usual'y
accepted meaning. I told Colonel
Bnrnum to explain to you why revival
services would be out of place
in a military camp, citing the dis- j
graceful performance In San Antonio
last winter as an example of what
revivals are apt to develop into, and
drawing to a certain extent on a general
knowledge as to how revivals or
'protracted' meetings, as they are
sometimes called; are usually con-1
ducted.
"Resents Implication.
"I further Instructed Colonel Barnum
to say to you that I did not j
accept, in fact, resented, the implication
that because a man had put on
his country's uniform he was necessarily
lost, or worse than other men,
that I thought there were people who
had stayed at home who. needed revivals
worse than the soldiers did.
"Soldiers must be protected from
imposition by their superior officers,
and if these officers from weakness or1
other reason, fail in their duty, their
oily resources is submission or riot;
and it is a safe gues that tho latter
is what you wouM have got with a
typical old fashioned revival in any
one of the camps."
