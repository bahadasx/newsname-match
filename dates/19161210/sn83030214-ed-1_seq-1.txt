? b'lstopher Wagner, pr?sidai ' "f

freni a fourth floor window of the
Montau'-t ( lub in Brooklyn and killed
himself a*. 6 o'clock last night, when
'an attempt was made to arrest him on
a charge of misappropriation of the

The ?urn ?pacified in the warrant was

plained that Wagner had been ill since.
Tuesday, when a gas jet had been
?urned on accidentally in his room.
Th? two callers gave a start at this in?
formation.
The caller? found Wagner clad in
pajamas and bathrobe.
"I can see you're ill." said Vaughan,
''and 1 will tak>- you to whatever hos
p tal you may ?ele.!."
Wugner stood silent und another
member of the club who was passing

"A little better, thank you." he said
with white lips, and then turned to his
? ... r.iHer i.
"I think If .v>ii will permit me to go
to the lavatory on the next floor, a
dash of cold water may brace me up,"
he a?
vliyenbcrg nodded and Vaughan ac
(ompar.ied Wagner to a door on th??
fourth floor, which, he said, was the
tntrsne? to a bathroom. Wagner en?
tered and shut the door behind him.
The dete, ,v?, after a moment of abso

"Why, there he is," replied th? Ml
vant, pointing to a door in the far side
of the room, which gave acce*? to an

the iron railing of a balcony on the
Eighth Avor.ue side of the building.
Wagner, tho rain and wind beating
upon his flim?v attire, was stunding,
peering into tH - street.
The detective leaped for his man,
but he wa? too late. Without so much
as a glance toward the suddenly
opened door, Wagnei ninfped from the

Efficiency and System
f lousework is booming a business and therefore
becoming better. And every business needs its proper
machinery. It needs efficiency and system as well.
Whether you read page 6, page 7. or page 8. or all
three, of Part VI this morning, you will find that the
keynote is the same. One tells of tested aids for the
household?the needed tools for efficient housework;
one tell? of a concealed kitchenette which might be
taken as a model for its more conspi? uous and larger
sisters; and one tells of a new sort of girls' training
school. They all have to do with efficiency and system.
For that is just what The Tribune Institute teaches?

foliigent. He repreaented the civil auUmritiea the Hollweg group,
There is a vast difference between the civil and military authorities. The
civil are much more liberal. They are eager to send news to America. I
was told of a nine-day tour which .included a visit to two prison camps,
and was invited to join the expedition.
Thfisc trips are magnificent foata in German propaganda. An intel?
ligent director conducts a group of reporters through the country. Ail
expenses are paid and the journalist?, feted and feasted.
It is hard to view Germany impartially when one is fed on cham?
pagne. I delayed my departure for a day. It was the moment of the
Liebknecht trial, and I wished to be present in case of an uprising. Also
by this postponement I avoided the special car assigned to journalists and
could pay my own railroad faro to Karlsruhe.
NOBILITY NEAR, EVERYBODY IS AWED
Berlin had been interesting. I was loath to leave. As I came
hack to the Adlon for afternoon tea there was a great crowd around trV
*-ntranee A porson in much gold braid and many military trappings stood
in the hallway. A hushful awe pervaded the place; even the American re
r-orters were humbly cringing in corners.
The Royal Princess was upstairs!
She and others of the nubility ?rare on their way to a fu?era!. A
Russian officer who had lnterniarrn-il with the German nobility had been
.killed at the front, and the relativ.-- wore attending his funeral.
Having had tea and readjusted their veils, the royal partv descended.
The ladies were in deepest mourning, their veils so thick that tot a spe?-k
ef fare was visible. A sacred circle surrounded them, into which no one
stepped. The crowd was pushed back.
Then C'arlyle and his clothes theory flashed upon me?these pcop!..
were Just a bundle of clothes! How much heart and brain lay beneath?
If only one could dress royally in bathing suits, it would be easier to form
: estim?t*??. Outside were shining carriages, fat and prancing horses (the
only fat horses in Berlin) and spick-and-span liveried servants A silent
crowd watched the entrance into the coaches. Rut it pressed- un close to
this bit of luxury.
PALE, THIN FACES PEER INTO ROYAL COACH
I wondered if the princess, thr?->ugh her black veil, could see the pale,
thin faces rieering in the carriage windows
Next day was the Liebknecht tria!. No paper announced it, but word
had been passed to me by the Social Democrats. That day I was up early.
I took a taxi and drove round and round the big. grim barracks where

London, Dec. 9.?Though David Lloyd
George completed most of his work in
forming the Cabinet ge-tarda] . he wss
busy all to-day making randjuitmant!
and alterations, due to eleventh-hour
refusals of certain men whom he had
espartad 'o serve under him gladly.
, Some of the new ministers, though not
sworn in, were ?t their desks early this
morning, plunging into the work where
their predecessors had left off.
All observers agree that the War
Council will be composed of Premier
, Lloyd G-.-orgc, Andrew Bonar I??w,
' Chancellor of the F.xchequer; Lord Mil
t.er, minister without portfolio; Lord
I'ut.on, president of th?? Council, ?nd
Arthur Henderson, Secretary for Lahor.
i Th? striking feature of this arrange?
ment is the ab-rence of representatives
of the army, nary and the Department
, of Foreign Affairs, which the Earl of
Derby. Sir Edward 'arson and Arthur
J. Balfour ?re, respectively, expected
to head.
The War Council will be '.he re?'

correspond to department heads of a
business organization.
