CLIFTON. Dec. S On Tuesday of
this week, J. G. Cash, who was de
feated for re-election, filed a com-
.... , ,. , I
Dlaint In the superior court alledne
that he hid received many more otes
In the general election than had been
counted for him ana asking for a re
count. The complaint was filed on
Arthur Slaughter, the successful can
didate that afternoon. He has ten I
days to answer and the time for mak-'
ing the recount will then be set by
the court.
The charges In the complaint are
sensational in nature, alleging that
the election officers of the lilue and
Eagle used whiskey freely all day
anil that votes were influenced by the
liquor; that many of the electors In
those districts marked their ballots
openly and showed them to others
after marking: that some ballots were
marked a mile away from the polls
and then sent bt messenger to the
ballot boxes. On these grounds the
complaint askes that the entire vote
of these two precincts be thrown out
The official count gave Slaughter
SS8 votes and Cash 816. The com
plaint allege. that the correct count
should be 1031 for Cash and 763 for
Slaughter. According to Cash "0
ballots were not counted for him that
should have been and 20 ballots were
counted for Slaughter that should not
have been In Clifton.
In Morenci he wants 71 more and
says Slaughter should have 24 less.
In Jletcalf 12 more for Cash and 10
less for Slaughter. Ouncan 11 more
and 20 less; in York 4 more and 4
less, in Sheldon 5 more and 5 less, in
Franklin 5 more aud 5 less, in Blue
14 more and 7 less, in Eagle 6 more
and 7 less. .

NOGALES, Dec. 9. Warning has
been issued from several sources
that it is adIsable for Americans to
be extremely wary and cautious,
while across the International line.
It is declared advisable for any man
who has an thing about his appear
ance that might make him easily mis
taken for a soldier to stay In the
United States.
Since four members of the Twelfth
Infantry were caught across the line
by Mexican officers, who were paid

for investigation on ne pretext that
they may be soldiers.
The local diplomatic service was
called upon to secure the release of
11 Americans from Imprisonment on

DUNCAN RESIDENTS HAVE
NARROW ESCAPE
FROM DEATH
In the roo near the Day farm be
low York, they met an automobile
driven by a Mexican and turned out
to give them room to pass, and in do
ing so they were crowded off the
road, the auto rolling down the hill
a distance of about 30 feet. Sir. Winn
was pinned under the car, while Sir.
Hutchens succeeded In extricating
himself from under the car and at
tempted to assist Sir. Winn, but due
to himself being injured to some ex
tent, he was unable to extricate him
and started for assistance.
At about 3 o'clock an auto from
Clifton came to the scene of the ac
cident and extricated Sir. Winn and
took him to Clifton, where his Inju
ries were dressed at the A. C. hospi
tal. Sir. Hutchlns succeeded In making
his way to the August Felge place

FEDERAL OFFICERS.
AVERIS CLASH i
AMONG
GLOBE. Dec. 9 After almost 24
hours of continuous travel. Deputy
United States Marshal J. J. Peegan
accompanied by B. F. Crawford, re-
turned to the city late last night from
Fort Apache with Jobu A. Day, an
Apache Indian, accused of murder.
The trip was made In response to
a telegram from the superintendent
of the White Mountain agency who
feared that the presence of the prls-
oner at the post might arouse trouble,
as feeling there runs high against the
accused.
Day is said to have attacked a 13-
year-old Indian girl by the name of
Nancy Hope, and then to hate beaten are considered of the most import
her brains out with a stone. While auce. Life sentence Instead ot the
the partnculars of (tie affair are lack- death peualt) will be capital punish
ing, the superintendent of the agency ment hereafter in Arizona. And with
claims to have a strong chain of cir
cumstantial evidence against the
man. The latter was given his pre
liminary examination at the agency,
and brought here on a committment.
From what little win be learned of
the affair it appears that Day, who
lives about four miles north of the
agency, was enamoured of the girl.
Wednesday afternoon Day suddenly
deserted two companion's with whom
he was walking and disappeared. The
pair through curiosity began to
search for him and stumbled upon the
body of the girl lying in some under
brush some distance away.
The head of the corpse had been
pounded to a Jelly and would have
been unrecognizable but for the cloth
ing. A large stone lying nearby was
covered with blood and hair and told
only too eloquently how the deed had
been accomplished. Tracks, purport
ing to be those of Day were found
leading to and from the scene of the
crime.
When apprehended by the native
police, the suspect was wearing the
same clothing with whl-h ie had
been garbed on the day of the mur
der. The shirt, however, had been
washed but still bore a peculiar, red
dish stain. His moccasins were also
spotted with red In spite of attempts
which had been made to erase the
tinge.
When the news became generally
known there was an ominous gather
ing of the friends and relatives of
the deceased with the result that Day
was taken to Fort Apache where he
was placed under the protection of
as detachment of U. S. cavalry which
It stationed there. To avoid a possi
ble clash it was deemed best to re
move the prisoner.
