TAKES BIG DROP
Figures Much Larger Than
v Expected, and Price of Sta
ple Decline Rapidly. , "
The crop reporting board of the
United States department of agricul
ture on Friday issued a bulletin show
ing? that 10,395.340 bales of cotton
had been pinned up to December 1.
Of this number 177,fiC2 were round
bales and 10,020 bales of Sea Island
cotton are also included.
Up to the correspoBding date last
year only 9,704,000 bales had been
ginned. This does not mean, how
ever, that the yield this season will
be anything like as large as last year.
The crop this feason was so small
and the weather so favorable that
picking was completed much earlier
than usual, and practically the en
tire crop has been harvested and
ginned.
While the figures contained in the
report were only a little larger than
expected the market broke immed
iately upon its i.yuance, and the mo'
Renoational decline of the sea ton civ
sued. Trices dropped off about 75
points Friday, while a similar de
cline marked yesterday's session, the
total loss caused by the report hav
ing amounted to something like 100
points, which is tantamount io iucut
$7.50 per bale.

The patrons will no doubt be de
lighted to learn that the famous
emotional actress, Madame Petrova,
will be the attraction at the Princess
Monday, 11th, and on account of the
unusual popularity of the star there
will be a large crowd present. Many
wilf" remember "Petrova" when she
appeared at the Princess some time
ago in "The Vampire," as this pic
ture probably pleased more than any
production that Metro had offered.
In Monday's production "The Soul
Market," Petrova is allowed full
scope for her wonderful ability as an
emotional actress and that together
with her reputation for being one of
the best dressed stars of the stage
and photoplay, should attract large
attendance. The management of the
Princess has decided to play this pro
duction at the regular .prices, chil

TOO GREAT, HE SAYS
Asquith Resigned Because of
Disagreement With the War
Council.
London, Dec. 9. Herbert II. As
quith declared at the meeting of lib
erals yesterday that there had been
a carefully engineered campaign
against him,- but he acquitted. Mr.
David Lloyd-George and his other as
sociates of complicity.
Li'st Friday Mr. Asquith said he
received Mr. Lloyd-George's proposal
for a smaller war council. He re
plied that the prime minister must
preside. Mr. Lloyd-George did not
agree with the alternative and on
Sunday the unionist ministers inti
mated that if he did not resign, they
would.
He saw Mr. Lloyd-George later and
appealed to A. Bonar Law to remain.
They had a conference and attempt
ed to accommodate their views as to
the relationship between the premier
and the war council. On these points
they differed strongly and sharply.
An arrangement was then suggest
ed whereby the premier should con
trol the war policy; that the war
council should submit its decisions to
him and all other matters submitted
to him. No decision was reached
and he wrote Mr. Lloyd-George next
day giving his decision.
The following morning he found a
statement in the newspapers that the
prei:iier was to be excluded from the
war council. He believed there had
been a breach of confidence, although
he su'eepted Mr. Lloyd-George's dis
claimer. He wrote Mr. Lloyd-George
that he would not remain in the cab
inet as n spectator of the . war and
that the war council must have the
premier as chairman. .
CAN SOLVE MARKET' PROBLEM
BY ADOPTING MAINE SYSTEM
EXPERT ADVISES NATIONALIZ
ING PLAN OPERATED IN
PINE TREE STATE.
Chicago, Dec. 9. Belief that the
marketing problem of the farmer can
be solved by nationalizing a system
now being carried out by the Far
mers' Union of Maine was expressed
here Thursday night by C. E. Em
bree, of Waterville, Me., the original
tor of the plan. Mr. Embree spoke
at a dinner of delegates to the Na
tional Conference on Marketing and
Farm Credits.
Mr. Embree outlined the Maine
system, by which, he said, "oppressed
farmers" were induced first to form
locals, each farmer buying a share of
stock at $10. There are now one or
more locals in every county of the
state, he said. These formed the
Farmers' Union of Maine. An of
fice was opened at Bangor, buying
and selling for the farmers, saving
$400,000 in the purchase of fertilizer
alone. The union, after a - four
years' growth from nothing, now has
fourteen warehouses for potatoes, 42
grain houses, six grocery stores, 84
local unions, a wholesale grain house,
a distributing house at Boston and a
selling agency in New York City, the
speaker said.
"At our first annual meeting,"
continued Mr. Embree, "our officers
reported a gross business of $52,000;
at the second annual meeting, $342,
000; at the third, $800,000 and at
the fourth $1,000,000."
He stated that stock in the locals
has paid dividends on top of the sav
ings.) He emphasized his conviction
that any such organization to be suc
cessful must have as a fundamental
requirement that farmers at all times
retain complete control.
America's most pressing problem
is marketing our crops so as to serve
the legitimate interests of farmers
and consumer alike, according to
Carl S. Voonnan, assistant secretary
of agriculture, another speaker.
"Among the factors that stand out
in the problem are rural credits,
satisfactory system of land tenure
the co-operative purchasing of sup
plies, the i acuities lor , uu,eLu
farm produce. These are subjects

SCOIT DEQUES VOLUNTARY
EUE PLAN I FAILURE
SAY3 EVERY CITIZEN SHOULD
PERFORM MILITARY DUTY
IN TIME OF PEACE.
Washington, Dec. 9. The volun
teer military system again has proved
a fuiluie arid should be relegated to
the past, declares Major (ieneral
Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff of the
army, in his annual report. Basing
hi conclusions on the Hhowing of the
federalized national guard, when
mobilized for border duty, and the
fact that strenuous recruiting cam
paigns for both the regulurs and the
guunlriinen have produced negligible
results, General Scott says:
"In my judgment the country will
never be prepared for defense until
we do as the other great nations do
that have large interests to guard,
like Germany, Japan and France,
where everybody is ready and does
perform military service in time of
peace sis he would pay every other
Ux, and is willing to make sacrifices
for th protection he gets and the
country gets in return. There is no
reusoi why one woman's son should
go out and defend or be trained to
defend another woman and her son
who refuses to take up arms in de
fense of hh country."
Taking up the question of the na
tional guard in its federal status,
General Scott declares the training
period of 75 days in three years pro
vided by the new national defense
act Is wholly inadequate.
"In my judgement," he says, "it
requires this force for being made
it for war service at least six months
additional training in time of war."
The report reiterates the opinion
that it takes years of intensive train
ing to make a soldier and adds that
the country and coin- anper to , house owned by Jir. aicv.iananan
have a vital misconception of the which went up in flames, was oc

MONEY APPEARS
TO BE PLENTIFUL
Short Crop Do Not Seem to
Have Cut Off Supply of Cash
in This Section.
Christmas is rapidly approachin .
and the holiday trade has opened ur
with a ru.sh. During the pa-a wee .
the business district has been th-jr-'oughly
alive with shoppers, and mer
chants in various lines have enjoyed
xenerous patronage.
The big business which the mer
chants are doing has been quite a
pleasant surprise to them, as they
feared that the short crops of the
past season would cause a shortage
of money and that sales would h!
correspondingly light. Contrary to
expectations, however, business has
been good, and during the past few
weeks has been on a boom. Tie
plentiful supply of cash is attribut
able to several causes. In the first
place, many local manufacturing en
terprises which had been closed down
for quite a long time are now in full
operation and are paying out lan-e
sums weekly to employes. Then, too,
there is an unprecedented demand
for timber, and many farmers hivc
sold the mills large quantities of this
commodity at good prices. Th mon
ey thus received has offset the losses
incurred in agricultural opeiaiicns,
and has placed them in a position to
supply their needs without stint or
restraint.
Local merchants have brought on
liberal stocks, and there are in the
different stores which eat?r t the
hM'.dsy trade thousands of beauti'"u!
and useful articles from which j.tt
rons can make selections. The plan of

throughout the country. l!y early

purchfie of Christmas presents easier
by fir.iiing large and unbroken
stocks, but make things much easier
for the merchants and their em
ployes, such a course prevents the

during the few days that
immediately precede the most uni
versally observed holiday of the en
