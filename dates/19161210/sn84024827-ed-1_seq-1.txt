Health Authorities Insist on
Pure Milk or Dairies Must
Shut Up Shop.
Finding that two given samples of
milk, taken from the delivery machine
of the Medigovich Dairy, were not up
to the standard and contained water,
the county board of health yesterday
afternoon Ordered the entire autoload
of milk, consisting of nearly one hun
dred gallons of the fluid, emptied in
the sewer. Aided by city and county
officers. Dr. Cleveland H. Hunt, county
health officer, and Dr. Ralph H. Her
endeen, city physician, emptied bot
les and cans into the subway amid the
plaudits of a large crowd which was
on hand to cheer for "Pure Milk."
That the campaign of the city and
county health departments looking to
ward the betterment of the jnilk sup
ply In the Warren District is sincere,
was amply demonstrated last evening.
DEFIES CITY?
Friday morning Dr. R. B. Durfee,
the city and county bacteriologist,
had secured a milk sample from
the Medigovich Dairy. According
to Dr. Durfee, Medigovich de
clared that he watered his milk
and would continue to do if he de
sired. The officers and doctors
tried to catch the dairyman as he
came into Bisbee from his milk
ranch Friday night He got by(
however, and the raid was post
poned. Method That Works.
Yesterday afterncfjn the delivery
auto was caught as it entered Bis
bee. The milk, in cans and in bottles,
was stacked high on the little machine.
The car was ordered driven to the
Central school. With the dairyman in
the machine was his daughter. Dr.
Durfee took two samples of the milk
and made immediate tests of them and
found each lacking in one respect and
containing water in each instance.
While the tests were being njade E.
J..Flanigan, attorney for the Medig
vich Dairy, was called and appeared
on the scene. He was Informed that
the health department was operating
under a certain law which gave it the
right to destroy impure food. No op
position' was offered when the machine
was driven to the subway entrance and
the contents thrown away. ?
Says Doctors Unfair.
Miss Medigovich, while the tests
were being made in the laboratory, de
clared that their milk was perfectly
good and up to standard in every way.
She added that it was merely someone
trying to run the small operators out
of business in the District.
The Doctors' Side.
Both Dr. Herendeen and Dr. Hunt
are determined that the sale of Im
pure or watered milk must stop.
"The trouble with taking the matter
through the law courts," said Dr. Her
endeen last evening, "is that the trial
in every case is greatly delayed and.
in the meantime, the dairyman goes
right on selling bad milk. We have
found another way out of the question.
The board of health can destroy im
pure food. Such as we destroyed this
afternoon is impure and any nrbre that
we find in like condition will suffer
the same fate."
Canned Milk O. K.
"If we can not get good milk for
our sick and our infants to drink,"
said Dr. Hunt, "Let us go bark and
drink canned milk. That, at least, is
sterilized. There is no reason for bad
milk being sold. If it is so that the
dairymen cannot make a living with
out doctoring their milk, then they
will have to fail. We can not afford to
sacrifice the possible health of our
people because a few men must make
a living by selling a questionable
article of food.

GENERAL VON FALKENHAYN'S
HEADQUARTERS IN RUMANIA, via
London, Dec. 9. One of the most in
teresting features of the Rumanian
campaign from a German standpoint
has been the spectacular work of the
new armored automobiles evolved
soon after the advent of the British
"tanks" on the Somme front, but
which the developments in Rumania
have shown to be a vast improvement
in efficiency over the British machine.
Even in the brief tests it lias had

I tains into the Rumanian plains, the

the constitutionalists, instead of re
