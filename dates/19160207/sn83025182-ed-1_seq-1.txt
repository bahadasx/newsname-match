WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.—Whether
thiB government shall compromise to
meet a compromise in the Lusitania
case, was to be decided today at the

President Wilson and Secretary Lan

Germany, according to Intimations
from her representatives here, has
conceded several points. This ap
peared to be a big factor in today's
conference.
Secretary Lansing, in response to
direct questions, has declared "the
American attitude regarding the Lusi
tania sinking remains unchanged,"
from that taken when tho United
8tates in a formal note called the act
Illegal and demanded disavowal. At
the white house the same thing has
been said insistently.
In view of this seeming deadlock,
officials here today continued to hold
the impression that the gravity of the
Jituation has not loosened, despite
Secretary Lansing's statement through
JJe United Press on Saturday that

row boat was reported to have been
seen approaching one of the piers of
the international bridge spanning the
Niagara betw'een Brldgeburg and Buf

Residents of Brldgeburg, living
near the bridge, declared they heard
two rifle shots about 1:30 tfcis morn
ing and it was said one of the soldiers
on guard had fired at the row boat. It
was about 200 yards from the bridge
when the guard fired..
The officer in command hurried to
the pier at the first shot and ordered
his men not to Are again until the
boat was close to the structure. The
boat pulled to the American side,
however, without approaching, closer
to the pier.

WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE
OVER LUSITANIA QUESTION
President Wilson and Secre
tary Lansing Talk Over
the Situation.
and not the past which he considers
most important. It was confidently
believed that if Germany's latest
•memorandum—even if it does not
frankly admit the sinking of the Lusi
tania was illegal and agree to a dis
avowal—will be acceptable, If it sug
gests phrases for a formal note which
can be usetf as a precedent and a
basis of international law which
would place without the pale a gov
ernment which ordered submarine
commanders to torpedo merchant
ships without warning.
This, the German Arabic note doen
not do, in the opinion of officials,, de
spite its seeming concession of all
American demands in that case, since
it admitted the submarine commander
who sent the Arabic to the bottom
"exceeded instructions of his govern
ment." It is this point that is the
crux of the Lusitania issue, for the
commander who sank that liner, with
its load of human freight was ordered
to do it. In other words, state de
partment officials said today, the Ara
bic agreement merely makes it illegal
for a commander to sink a merchant
ship without warning, provided he
isn't so ordered by his government.
It was believed therefore that the
informal suggestion that Germany
would be willing to refer in the pre
face of her next formal Lusitania note
to the Arabic concessions, would not
be considered relevant by President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing.
The announcement which Secretary
Lansing said may be made today or
tomorrow, was not expected until he

"Wniie it is true as reported that

A Change in Plans.
NEW YORK, Feb. 7.—Wall street
received the news of the purchase of
the Cambria Steel company by the
Midvale Steel and Ordnance company
with the greatest interest today, as it
is regarded as changing for the time
being at least, the entire aspect of
plans for a big steel merger, along
the line of the United States Steel
corporation which Standard Oil inter­|for
ests have been perfecting.
Financial experts have seen indica
tions for several months of the Stand
ard Oil group planning a merger of
independent steel plants throughout
the country on a scale that would
rival United States Steel. The gen
eral plan, it was understood, was the
merging into one group of two or
three companies and formation of
similar small groups into a unit, and
eventually bringing the various
groups together.
The first big step in this plan was
the formation of the Midvale Steel
and Ordnance company. The second
was the opening of negotiations to
merge Lackawanna Steel, Cambria
and the Youngstown Sheet and Tube
company.
A stumbling block in this latter
merger was encountered according to
reports today, in the Speyer banking
interests who are largely interested
in Lackawanna Steel and Youngstown
Sheet and Tube and a group of middle
western bankers, also interested in
these companies. The middle west

On Ferdinand's last visit to the Ger

LONDON, Feb. 7^—The idea that
the German fleet will come dashing
out of. the Kiel oanal some day, equip
ped with seventeen inch guns that
will blow England's dreadnoughts to
pieces, was ridiculed by British naval
experts today.
The story about the 17 Inoh gun was
first printed In a London paper. The
activity of the German navy, it was ex
plained, was due to the fact that these
new guns, capable of hurling more
than a ton of metal a distance of
twenty miles, were being placed
aboard German warships.
Official utterances on the subject
are taboo in London. Nevertheless
it was learned today that British nav
al officers believe the fifteen Inch gun
with which the monster Queen Eliza
beth Is equipped, Is the maximum cal
ibre for real efficiency, especially In
the North sea where the British and
German fleets might clash.
The angle of a shell from a seven
teen Inch gun must exceed fifty de
grees, It was stated. The range of
the weapon is twenty miles. At th|a
distance, It was argued, It would be
necessary for the Germans to assign
small vessels to the business of "spot
ting" hits on enemy vessels. Great
Britain's swift cruisers and destroyers!
would drive In the German "spotters,"
