north of Lake Village. 40(1 persons were
on the levee to-night without shelter.

Weather Rureau, who is in Little Hock,
declared that a condition similar to
that which now exists in Arkansas has
never before occurred in the history
of the Weather Rureau
"Heavy snow, followed by thaw, and
heavy rains in Illinois and other
Northern States have caused a rise in
the upper Mississippi Riv< r." he said.
"The Ohio was tlooded in its lower
course, and general rains in the val
leys of the Arkansas, Hed, White and
other tributaries of the Mississippi have
flooded the latter liver until it will
require nearly a month for the water
to ran out. The swollen condition of
the Mississippi has made the Arkansas
River flood much more disastrous than
it otherwise would have been."

All the rats are before us in the

the empire are concerned, we can put
as many mm into the lines in France
to hold the Teutons as the French
have.,
Itcgarding the li'iancial situation, if
i I were younger, I would say an im
I mense wave of prosperity follows every
| war. but I leave that thesis to people
I twenty years younger, and accept the
i commoner belief that universal ruin
j awaits us. Hut wli>n the whole wothl
. i.< materially ruined, each nation will
! be as. rich as Its neighbor. I imagine

. sciil.ers are not numerous, a ceitain
! proportion of debt will be simply ef
' faced or repudial <u for the very just
' reason that met. rich enough to lend

to lose them. It is immoral, but we
! should onlv laugh, and so would even

comma nuers of submarine:*. In tho

Tile position of the llerlin ollicials
is said t.? lu- thr.t the :i"'- of a com
mander of a submarine tan dis
avowed, should lo* violate, disregard or
have failed to receive instructions, but
that a uovernmer.t cannot disavow nn
act which was committed in accord
ance with its instructions, and for
which it Is i ostensible.
in tho latest proposal there Is no
attempt to deny responsibility for t:i-f
sinking of tiie laisitnnia. but dorinaiiy
assumes liability for tho American lives
lost, offers reparation by the payment
of indemnity, and assures the I'nited
States that the Uillinn' of Americans
was without precedent. The west ruc
tion of tin liner was an act of reprisal
for the blockade under the order- >n
council, according to the German view,
and reprisals should not I ave been ap
plied to neutrals. The tentative com
m\>nication also states thai the method
of conduction subniaiii.e warfare in
the North Sea has been moditied be
cause of fiiendshlp for the I'nited
States, and because of tho fact 'that
American lives had been lost. In ibis
last connection It was said to-n>:rlit,
that it was within the ranpe of pos
sibilities that some reference iniyht
be made in tho preface of th- com
