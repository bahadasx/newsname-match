Capture of Stowaway on Sher
man Saturday, After At
tempted Assault on Officer,
Opens Way for Official Probe
THINK ECTOR'S SLAYER
IS NUMBERED IN RING
Negroes, Authorities Say, Have
Been Donning. Uniforms Aft
er Discharge, and Gambling
With Men at Posts Paydays
Through the arrest on the transport
-Sherman Saturday afternoon of Clar
ence Weekly, a dishonorably discharg
ed colored soldier, there may be ex-loosed-
a- gang pf ex-members of the
" 25th Infantry, who are believed to be
! responsible for a ' number of crimes
in Honolulu. Weekly - waa arrested
as a stowaway, and after he vas jail
ed It was reported by a colored sol
dier that Weekly tried in cnt the
lockets out of. his cloths while he
'waa asleep, and threatened to kill him
. with a knife In a' Honolul.i rooming
house January 19.
' The evidence may show that a few
oldlers who have been put out of the
army are by their actions casting un
justified suspicion on well-behaved
, v infantrymen now In the service, who
- ' ." resent as much as anyone else that
army men are thus put under a cloud.
With - Henry TurUy, discharged sev
eral months ago from the 25th Infan
try without honor, Weekly was found
on the Sherman Saturday by Lieut
Alfred "E. Sawklna, 25th ' Infantry,
when Sawklna took a bunch of cas
uals down to the transport to. put
thera aboard.- The men were caught
trying to stow away and both were
wearing, the unlflorml, Turley, was
,' passed by Lieut. Saw-kins as a soldier,
but when be saw Weekly, who for
merly served : In his company, he at
? , once recognized him as a discharged
- man; V; t-i-y
'. Made RushT Officer. '
f- -When the lieutenant spoke., to
--Weekly -the latter cursed him . and.
ran at him", receiving two blows-on'
" rtjtb5 Jaw from Sawklnsr fist He was
then placed in the patrol and taken to
JalL Turley was arrested and releas
ed, but Weekly was held on account
,of the attempted assault , 1
This morning a colored' soldier, who ;
had personally reported that he woke
VP In his room in a lodging house late -at
night January 19 to find a man
standing over him with a knife -In
his hand, identified Weekly as the
man he saw. Another crime of rob
; bery .Is also being Investigated on
v" the theory that Weekly knows some
- thing of it .r .
f Evidence has been obtained which
shows almost conclusively that Week
ly Is 'member -of a band of former
25th Infantrymen who remain on
Oahu Just to "trim" soldiers. .They
each have uniforms, and on pay days
;r go . to ;' Schofield tn the.se, mix with
the soldiers, and get as much of their
; - money as they can, gambling. .. What
. ,A ; they cannot get thia way' the police
Bay they do not hesitate to get by
crime' when they can manage it
Think Murderer In Band, r ; t
' ' ' .'Among this . gang of discharged
men the authorities believe Is the
. murderer of Pvt. Jesse Ector, found
dead on the Kolekole road, near Scho
field Barracks i January 28, -with his
throat cut and five bullet wounds, in
i.ij. ,bls body. Ector was a habitual gamb
... , ler and knew some of the discharged,
men, having often played with them.
That he may have won money the
night he was killed Is possible, and
if he did come of the discharged men
would probably have known, of it. ,
i So far in the Quest none of tie
slight. clues which have been picked
. up by Deputy Sheriff H. H. Plemer,
, who la handling the Ector case, has
led to any real facts about the mur-,.-
der being discovered. Except for the
suspicion that among the ex-soldiers,
. nearly all of them dishonorably dis
charged, la the man who killed Ector
the. murder Is still an absolute mys
tery. ' , 1 - .

Opinion Held By Judge

Kuhio to break the trust in which
the queen's property U held, and de

of the demurrers and the-jqueen's mo

Nothing to- Recommend IL
"It is claimed that, the trust deed
shows upon its face that the allega

effect that the queen was not capable
of taking proper care of her interests
at the time of executing it The is

all, I should say now is that U find
nothing in the trust deed to recom
