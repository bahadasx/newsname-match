Review of War Situation.
"While recent reports of the actual
opening of an offensive movement
by the Teutonic allies against Salon
lkl appear to have been premature,
the cables continue to bring accounts
of various troop movements held in

an offensivo is probably not far dis

3 Rumania Arming Border.
: Advices from allied sources declare
f that the friction between Rumanoa

j and that Rumania, supposedly in view
I of the reported threatening attitude
of Germany and Austria has collected

frontier. The chief capitals of the
( entente allies, however, appear to bo
impressed with the idea that an im
J portant offensive Is shortly to be be-
gun by the Germans In the west.
i Although the Ottoman forces around

BEATH TOLL OF
BOMB MAKERS
Many Good Men Blown to
Pieces by Their Own
Inventions.
FIENDISH WAY TO FIGHT
Bomb Throwing an Art in Its
Infancy Injuries Among
,! the Ghastliest.
London, Feb. 7. (Correspondence
- of The Associated Press). "A bomb
is like a woman, you can never ten
what it is going to do next, ' writes an
Irish officer from the British front in
.Flanders. He lias been engaged for
several weeks in experimenting wltn
bombs and various new-fangled bomb
throwing devices.
"The more one hns to do with
bombs, the more afraid one becomes
of them," he continues, "for one can
not play with explosives all day with
out going aloft some time, and the toll
of good men who have been blown to
Pieces by their own bombs is both
t long and sad.
f- "Bomb throwing as an art is still
II In its infancy, changing almost from
II day to day, and what state of develop-
Mai toent or perfeotion it will have reach-
ed before the end of the war cannot
i be guessed. At the best it is a fiend-
1 ish way of fighting, for its. injuries
' are ever of the ghastliest.
"Yet bombing, like most other as
pects of the war, has its humorous
side, and I have seen a whole trench
helpless with laughter at the sight of
two men running opposite ways to
avoid a sausage bomb they had spot
ted sailing over from a German trench
mortor. They collided, and sat down
facing each other like vaudeville com
edians. The bomb dropped in the
middle, almost touching them both,
and then completely failed to explode.
"One morning twenty or more
members of ihe general staff came
around to our trench to witness a test
of a new catapult arrangement for
throwing bombs to the considerable
distance of 250 yards. With great in
terest they watched the screwing
down of the great arm, and tho plac
ing and securing of the bomb In posi
tion Then upwards and forwards
swung the arm, but the missile, in
stead of hurtling in the direction of
the enemy, rose gently a few feet In
the air, not having been properly se
cured, and then prepared to descend
again to earth. Such a rapid and
complete self-effacement of staff offi
cers had never before been seen;
'they-fled like-rabbits,' and as they
rounded the corner of the trench, the
bomb went off a few feet from the
ground, completely destroying the
new catapult."

Paris, Feb 7, 4 '30 a. m Georges
Clomenceau, formerly French premier,
comenting in his newspaper, L'Hom
me Enchiane, on Colonel House's mis
sion, which he says "seems to me
characteristic of President Wilson's
spirit of hesitation." writes:
"Europe has suddenly seen a dumb
missionary disembark on its shores
for a tour of inspection among the
combatants. He has passed every
where, appearing and disappearing by
turns, like the flying Dutchman in the
mints of the horizon. He has said
nothing, his whole mission evidently
being to observe. His task, I suppose,
is to report faithfully to the Presi
dent candidate the conclusions he
draws from personal observation as to
the balance of the forces between the
belligerents.
"I know nothing about Colonel
House," concludes M. Clemenceau,
"but the fact that he has been chosen
for this investigation by the first
magistrate of the American republic
leads me to infer that he has at least
the qualities of observation and good
sense. This is enough to satisfy me
as to the results of his investigation."

Col. William P. Hepburn, although
twenty years in Congress, became
best known throughout the country
during the Roosevelt administration.
It was he who 'framed whab later
was called the Hepburn law, prohibit
ing rebates and discrimination by
railroads. As chairman of the house
committee on interstate and foreign
commerce in the first session of the
fifty-ninth Congress he was the auth
or of three acts out of five, which the
then President Roosevelt afterward
declared would cause that Congress to
be memorable in history because of
its constructive legislation. Of the
five acts, four came from Col. Hep
burn's committee and three of them
the Hepburn law, the pure food act
and the public health act were fram
ed by Col. Hepburn himself.
Represented E.'ghth Iowa.
Mr. Hepburn represented the Eighth
Iowa district. He also was an effici
ent soldier and a lawyer of high repu
tation. He was a product of the early
pioneer days in Iowa and got what lit
tle schooling he had in three winters
at an academy near Iowa City. He
was born in Columbiana County, 0.,
November 4, 1833, removing to Iowa
City where his mother and his step
father took up their residence on a

Washington, Feb. 7. Germany has I H
agreed that reprisals must not be dl- jH

subjects. This expression Is offered '' H
by Germany to take place of the H
phrase containing the word "Illegal" M
which was Incorporated In the draft
of the Lusitania agreement now un- M
dcr consideration.
Washington, Feb. 7. Secretary Lan- : 'H
sing today flatly denied that new de- H
mands had been made in the Lusitania jH
case at a time when the German gov- -i H
ernment considered the negotiations 1
practically were at an end. He was 'TH
speaking of the Berlin dispatches jH
quoting the references by Dr. Zlmmer- 4
man, German under-secretary of for- ,
eign affairs, to "new demands." M
"This government," said Secretary ' M
Lansing, "has not increased the de-
mands made in the Lusitania case as ", M
set forth in the notes of May 13th, H
June 9th and July 21st. I doubt if ' H
Dr. Zimmerman ever made the state- . H
ment that new demands had been in- M
jected, because he must know that it ,
is utterly false." jH
Secretary Lansing would not dis- : H
cuss Dr. Zlmmermann's statement fur-
ther. When Dr. Zimmermann's state- il
ment was published in this country, : H
however, his reference to new de- - M
mands was taken to apply a possible ' Jl
construction on the word "Illegal" in '
the proposed form of settlement. The IjH
only ground American officials could
find for constructing that as embody- 1
Ing a new demand, was the possl- hI
billty that it might be considered ap- 4
pllcable not alone to the destruction tl
of neutrals on the Lusitania, but also M
as to the method by which she was il
sunk. 1
Situation Practically Unchanged. M

Secretary Lansing indicated that Ijl

few days. .
There was no indication whether ll

Administration officials let It be H
known that a mere choice of words H
would not be permitted to stand in M
the way of success of the negotia- :

Principal Contention of U. S.
Tho principal consideration of tho H
United States now is that, there shall j jH
be an acknowledgment by Germany ' M
that the sinking of an unresisting tl
merchantman without warning is con- jl
traventlon of international law and il
that such naval warfare shall be per- ,flH
manently discontinued. The German jl
contention is that such assurances al- jll
ready have been given in tho Arabic I
Von Bernstorffs Note. H
The' full text of Ambassador Von rf
Bernstorffs note delivered to Secrc- 1
tary Lansing on September 1, 1915, . H
was as follows: H
"My Dear Secretary: With refer- jfl
ence to our conversation of this morn- jl
ing I beg to inform you that my in- fH
structions concerning our answer to j M
your last Lusitania note contain the j i-
followintr nassace: ' 1
" 'Liners will not be sunk by our M
submarines without warning and with- H
out safety of the lives of non-combat- j jj
ants, provided that the liners do not i 1
try to escape or offer resistance.' ,' M
"Although I know you do not wish ( i H
to discuss the Lusitania question till H
the Arabic incident has been definite- Ll
ly and satisfactorily settled, I desiro PH
to inform you of the above because , M
this policy of my government was de- J M

would only say, "that in view of its jM
