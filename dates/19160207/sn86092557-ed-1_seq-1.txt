Y. II. C. A. AGAIN
TO 11 STATE
First Move in Membership
Campaign Will Occur
Tonight.
A campaign to Increase the mem
bership of the Young Men's Christian
association to a number which will sur
pass Parkersburg, which at present
leads the state,;-??lll be Inaugurated by
Secretary J. W. Kighf on Tuesday,
February 22, and will continue until
the night of Friday, February Zo.
The membership committee will
serve a luncheon to several business
and professional men at, the V. M. C.
A. this evening. At - this repast the
methods employed in running the cam
paign will be thoroughly gone over and
any suggestions offered will be investi
gated and acted upon or ignored, as
may be decided by the committee..The
membership committee consists o?
Chairman George T. Watson, irank
B Pryor, O. F. Lough, Ira A. Aiken,
J. M. Jacobs, H. J. Hartley and Prof.
Joseph Rosier.
To create interest in the campaign
there will be selected two teams, one
to wear a red and the other a blue
ribbon. These two bodies will compete
with each other for the larger amount
of ne wmembers and as the campaign
progresses the work of the reds and
blues will be indicated on the huge
electric sign atop the Y. M. C. A.
building. At present the letters of the
sign are lighted by white globes. The
White gloges - will be removed and
two letters will be filled with red and
the other two with blue globes.
On Tuesday night the team that is
ahead will encroach on the territory
of the rival team. Should the blues be
leading Tuesday night, a few blue
lights will be placed in one ot the let
ters of the red team and vice versa
should the reds be winning. The same
method of lndlcatlonwlll continue each
night until the campaign Is over.
The local Y. M. C. A. has a member
ship now of over 1100, closely trailing
Parkersburg, which boasts the largest
in the state, or over 1200 members.
The chief reason for Parkersburg hold
ing the leaderships that last fall J. W.
Klght. secretary of the Fairmont asso
ciation, went to the,Oh to river, city.and
put on one of the most extensive cam
paigns ever held in the state.
The result of his work there ppt ,his
home town membership behind and ;ho
now wants to gee'Fairmont leading. A
conservative guess is,' that by thfe-time
the campaign Ms .finished, there, will vbe
over 1100 members registered at the lo
cal association building.
The work of running the campaign
I will be" taken over-by the membership
committee and the finance committee.
