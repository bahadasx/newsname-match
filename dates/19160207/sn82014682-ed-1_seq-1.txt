by Sheriff Charles H. Rose led to the
conclusion that the man killed himseBf

any clue to the Identity of the sui

" Just opposite the gateto the Isen

it blew the 'body 12 feet away and;

Queer Garment Combination.
The dead r man was evidently of
rather large frame.' He wore a blue
green hat which was blown to tat
ters by the giant powder j explosion
that caused his death. His Overshirt
was a light collarless garment his
trousers dungaree, and he iwore ' a
pair of neat, low-quarter black soes,
on which no marks can be found. Hie
undergarments were a part-wool un
dershirt and a pair of cotton drawers.
v The neat low-quarter shoes, -the
dungaree trousers and the apparent
ly once stylish hat do not jibe. In the
opinion of the police, and the further
fact that there is not a mark of any
kind on any garment except the hat
which is labeled "Hainan Brand,?
leads to the conclusion that the man
purposely put Dnclothe which could
not possibly be traced. ) '
Forty cents and a briarwood pipe
were found in the pockets of the
trousers, ,and. close to the place the
man is supposed to have sat when he
killed himself was found a newspa

tle & Cooke. Ltd., local Matson agents,
believe every Matson steamer from to
morrow until the Mid-Pacific Carnival
opens, will bring large numbers of
tourists. '
The Wilhelmina, following the Lur
line, Is expected to have a capacity
list of cabin passengers, and the Ma
noa, due to arrive February 22, the
second day of the Carnival, will un
doubtedly be crowded.
Although no advices have yet been
received concerning advance bookings
on the Oceanic steamer Sierra, due to
leave San Francisco tomorrow, D. H.
Gilmore of Brewer & Company's pas
senger department said today he ex
pects a-large number of passengers to
be reported by radio from the steamer.
Bookings out are light at present
indicating that the large number of
tourists now in Honolulu intend to
remain over for the Carnival.
Castle & Cooke's passenger depart
ment this morning reported only 100
passengers booked for the Matsonia,
sailing at 10 o'clock Wednesday morn
ing for San Francisco. The steamer
can carry 250 cabin passengers. For
the Ventura, sailing tomorrow after
noon, only 30 are booked.
"I am pretty sure the Makura will
bring a large number of tourists from
Victoria and Vancouver February 23,
for the Carnival," said Wentworth M.
Buchanan, of Theo. H. Da vies & Com

good many more than usual and the
spring travel season will begin up
there shortly, too."
Both the Great Northern and North

lists to Honolulu February 21 and 22.
The Great Northern is booked full,
which means she will bring close to
700 passengers and Northern Pacific

Attorney Horace W. Vaughan said to

to prison for bigamy. The complain
ant was Pasqual Dagoman, who al
leged that his wife, Benigna, had run
off .with and married Malicio without
having first secured a divorce.
According to the attorney for the
defendants, the letter which has been
received shows that when Pasqual
married Benigna the marriage was il
legal, therefore making the latter '8
marriage with Malicio a legal one,
and not holding Benigna open to hav
ing committed bigamy.
"If the attorney for the defendants
can convince me that the documents
in the letter are authentic, I shall
be glad to reopen the case, and either
have the sentence set aside or have
the man and woman pardoned," says
District Attorney Vaughan.
