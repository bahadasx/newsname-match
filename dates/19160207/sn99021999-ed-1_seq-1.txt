The Kreus Zeltung points out that the

taken away from the Germans their
weapons and even faltered them If so
desired. "Who believes." It asks, "the

"Aa against America and Its commerce
In the orient and South America," he said,
."Germany and England wj! be one united

Senator Lewis declsred there Is not one
friendly nstlon in the world that would
give a life or expend a dollsr out of any
spirit of affection or regard to preserve
any Interest of the United States. Our
future troubles, he declared, will result
from our attempt to enforce the Monroe
doctrine.
"The lCuropean nations," he asserted,
"will deny us the right to serve ss guard
ians for South America and will bring
their forces to South or Central America,
and there call upon us to advance there
with our armed forces to dislodge them.
"In the orient," Ben a I or Lewis said,
"Japan and Russia will form an alliance
sgainst American encroachment, and also
to oppose territorial acquisition, by Oer
