German west equatorial Africa. A
Spanish official communication eays
that 900 Germane and 14,000 of their
colonial troops have crossed the south
west border and sought asylum in
Spanish Guinea, where they were dis

Except on the western line in France
and Belgium and on the Caucusaa
front, little fighting of moment is in
progress In any of the war theatres.
In northwest Russia there have been
aerial raids by both the Germans and
Russians, and in Galicia and Bukowina
small infantry and grenade attacks. At
one point along the line, where the
Russian General IvanofE is in com
mand, the Russians found a system of
Teuton mines, and, having wired it,
detonated the mines.
The British and French in Belgium
have shelled with destructive effect
German trenches at Boesinghea and
the French heavy guns have silenced a
German battery to the east of Boesing
hea. . In Champagne the French report the
wrecking of German trenches on the
pdateau of Navarin and the blowing
up . of munitions depots. In addition,
Paris records the demolition of as

INTO SPANISH GUINEA.
They Have Been Disarmed and In
' terned There.
' Madrid, Feb. 8, via London, 12.20 p.
m. Nine hundred Germans and four
teen thousand of their colonial, troops
from the German colony of Kamerun
have crossed the border into Spanish
Guinea, according to an official an
nouncement made here today. The
troops have been disarmed and intern
ed. The government is taking meas
ures for their sustenance.
This is taken here to indicate that
the Franco-British campaign in the
Kaberan is nearing a conclusion.
The Franco-British campaign against
ehe Kamerun, a German protectorate
in western equatorial Africa, was be
gun in the spring of 1915. - French and
British official reports have told of the
occupation of Ngaundere, one of the
chief interior trading stations, which,
from its situation, climate and the
number of roads convergin gfrom it,
was the center of German resistance;
of the taking of Tibati, 137 miles from
the Nigerian border; and the more re
cent capture of the towns of Daing,
Nkan Lododorf and the retirement of
large convoys into Spanish Guinea.
The Kamerun protectorate has an
area of 191,130 square miles and has a
population og 2,540,000, including about
2,000 whites. The only other posses
sion of the Germans in Africa not con
qtlered by the allie sis the protectorate
of German East Africa, which has an
area of 384,000 square miles and a pop

lecture at the London school of econ
omics. Sir George Paish, editor of the
Etatist, said that in the year 1916 the
economic and financial strength of
Great Britain would be subjected . to
the severest test as she proposed to
privide her allies and colonies with
loans of at lease 400,000,000 pounds
and probably 600,000i000 pounds and
to support a bigger navy than ever
and 4,000,000 men in the field.
The speaker expressed the belief
that nobody could accuse the British
nation of any superabundance of brain
power, adding that probably her very
mediocrity in this respect was the
cause of her strength. The really
clever man or nation, he declared, fre
quently became a public danger, but
the British nation never made the mis
take of being too clever.
SOUTH GERMAN PRESS
ADOPTS MODERATE TONE.
With Reference to the American-German
Controversies.
Zurich, via London. Feb. 6, 11.25 p.
m. The South German press has
adopted a more moderate tone with
reference to the American-German
controversy. . The Munich Neueste
Nachrichten suggests that nothing can
be gained at this critical moment by
heated utterances, as "all such ex
pressions of opinion. have no influence
on the actual decision, wmch now lies
with America.
"Germany's answer, "continues the
paper, "is the highest degree concili
atory." MRS. MOHR ACQUITTED;
NEGROES FOUND GUILTY
Doctor's Wife Swooned as Verdict
Was Rendered.
Providence, R. L, Feb. 6. :Mrs. Eli
zabeth F. Mohr was acquitted tonight
by a jury in the superior court of a
charge of having instigated the mur
der of her husband, Dr. C. Franklin
Mohr. Victor Brown and Henry H.
Spellman who were accused of the
actual killing, were found guilty. The
jury reported at .07 o'clock after be
ing out since 10.50 o'clock yesterday
morning. The verdict means life im
prisonment. Mrs. Mohr swooned while the fore
man was announcing the verdict. Her
head dropped forward and she was
slipping from her chair when her at
torneys grasped and supported her,
while a court officer rushed for a glass
of water.
"Is there any other charge against
these defendants ?' inquired Justice
Stearns when the verdict had been
given.
"There is, your honor," replied At
torney General Rice. But Mrs. Mohr
is on bail on the other charge."
"The defendants Brown and Spell
man are committed without bail," said
the court, "and Mrs. Mohr is dis
charged from custody on this . com
plaint." The other charge against Mrs. Mohr
and the two negroes is that they com
mitted an assault oh Miss Emily Bur
ger with intent to kill. Miss Burger
was shot while riding with Dr. Mohr
on the night he was attacked. The
negroes are accused of actually firing
the shots at Miss Burger, while Mrs.
Mohr is charged with being an ac
cessory before the fact to tha crime.
TENSION BETWEEN U. S. AND
GERMANY AT RUPTURE POINT
According to Interview With German
Undersecretary.
Paris, Feb. 6. Newspapers comment
on the interview of Dr. Alfred Zim
mermann, German under-secretary for
foreign affairs, with the Associated
Press, relative to the ILusitania case,
which is prominently displayed, is to
the effect that the tension between the
United States and Germany is now at
the rupture point. The Matlnnj-thinks
that either the United States or Ger
many must yield and that it will not
be the United States. If President
Wilson should obtain Germany's ca
pitulation, says the Petit Parisian, it
will be a great diplomatic victory and
if he breaks off relations with Ger
many it will be an eloquent lesson in
morality to the world.
Stephen Pinchon, former minister of
foreign affairs, writing in the Petit
Journal, expresses the belief that the
United States government is evidently
now conscious of the sterility of its
diplomatic action. ,

TRAIN SERVICE HALTED
IN NEW YORK SUBWAY
As Result of Short Circuit in Cable Box
at Grand Central Station.
New York, Feb. 8. Train service
was halted in the subway twice within
twenty minutes tonight and New
York's underground railway system
was in darkness as the result of a
short circuit in a cable box at the
Grand Central station. Thousands of
passengers, with rumors of bomb plots
fresh in their minds, became alarmed,
but the lights were off only a few min
utes and the guards experienced little
difficulty in preserving order.
While the accident was not unusual,
it followed upon the heels of a general
police order for patrolmen to guard
subway entrances and exits and search
all suspicious persons carrying suit
cases or bundles. As a consequence,
it caused fear that something serious
might have happened.
The power was first shut oft at 7.20
o'clock after an emergency alarm. A
hurried inspection by officials failed to
disclose and break in the feed wire,
and eight minutes later the power was
turned on again. A second emergency
alarm was sounded two minutes after
wards, and the underground system
was again plunged into darkness. The
trouble. was then located and in ten
minutes trains were moving as usual.
While a rumor persisted that the
extra police guard was ordered as a
precaution against the carrying out of
a suspected plot to blow up New
York's underground and elevated rail
ways, the police themselves treated the
report lightly.
In authoritative sources tonight it
was said the placing of the extra po
lice guards at the various stations and
exits was part of a new plan inaugu
rated by the police to round up thieves.
Publicity given the report that a bomb
plot was suspected caused a change in
the plan, it was said, and most of the
patrolmen were instructed to resume
their regular beats.
The decision to discontinue the
guard at the subway and elevated
stations was not reached until after a
long conference this afternoon between
a number of police officials. There was
much secrecy surrounding the confer
ence and afterward none of the offi
cials would discuss the various reports
in circulation.
TO CONSIDER THE LATEST
S-f LUSITANIA COMMUNICATION.
President Wilson and Secretary Lan
,. sing to Confer Today.
Washington, Feb. 6. President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing are ex
pected to confer tomorrow on the lat
est tentative draft of the communica
tion the German government hopes to
bring the negotiations over the Lusi
tania disaster to satisfactory termina
tion. Information that the outlook for
an early settlement of the case again
was promising was received tonight
from various diplomatic and official
quarters.
The president has had the tentative
draft before him since Friday night.
In it, German officials say, the Berlin
foreign office has gone as far as it
possibly can to meet the position of
the United States. From high diplo
matic quarters tonight came the state
ment that Germany believes that she
has, with the exception of making an
out and out disavowal of the Lusitania
sinking, which she considers impossi
ble, conceded every desire of the United
States and that the tentative proposal
materially strengthens the assurances
already given in the negotiations over
the sinking of the steamship Arabic. It
is also claimed that the tentative proposal-covers
all the fundamental Is
sues involved in the conduct of sub
marine warfare in the North sea.
It is explained that a direct dis
avowal was given for the sinking of
the Arabic bec.fl.iiAA thaf woo t.
-violation of the instructions given the
commanders or submarines. In the
case of the Lusitania, however, the
commander acted in accordance' with
orders. The general instructions not
to sink liners without warning were
given, it was disclosed tonight, by high
authority on the day the Lusitania
went down. It was said that Germany
withheld announcement of the fact for
strategical naval reasons.
EXTRA GUARDS ASKED FOR
EAST RIVER BRIDGES
While the Cruiser Washington is Pass
ing Under Them.
New York, Feb. 6. Extra police
guards were stationed on the Brook
lyn and Manhattan bridges today, at
the request of Rear Admiral Usher,
commandant of the New York navy
yard, it was announced at Brooklyn
police headquarters, to safeguard the
passage under the structures of the
United States cruiser Washington,
which arrived at noon from Haiti.
The police said Rear Admiral Usher
explained to them that he desired the
extra guards as a precautionary meas
ure against the possible dropping of
bombs on the cruiser as she passed
under the bridges.
The action of the rear admiral was
clouded in mystery at the navy yard.
Commander Frank B. Upham, aide to
the rear admiral, declared tonight there
was no reason to suppose that any one
contemplated lrurlfe)g bombs on the
Washington and that no request had
been made of the police for additional
guards on the bridges.
The cruiser Washington, which will
be relieved by the Tennessee in Haitien
waters, will sail from here tomorrow
for 'Portsmouth, N. H., where she will
be used as a training ship.

No Agreement
for Polish Relie'
HAS YET BEEN REACHED BE
TWEEN THE BELLIGERENTS
AGREEMENT IS REMOTE
Impracticable to Do Anything of a
Systematic Order Until Some Defi
nite Conclusion is Arrived at.
London, Feb. 6, 7.45 p. m. The for
eign office has given out a letter from
Sir Edward Grey, secretary for for
eign office, to Herbert C. Hoover,
chairman of the American commission
for Relief in Belgium, and the ca
blegrams exchanged between the Po
lish relief societies of Chicago and
Premier Asquith, which indicate that
no agreement has yet been reached be
tween the belligerents for the relief of
the civie population of Poland.
Supplementing this , correspondence.
The Associated Press has been given a
letter from Mr. Hoover, which result
ed in the 'reply published by the for
eign office. The correspondence on
the subject leaves the problem of feed
ing Poland unsettled and confirms the
opinion in well-informed relief, cir
cles here that any agreement which
would enable relief to be carried on is
so remote as to make it extremely
improbable.
Hoover's Letter to Sir Edward.
Mr. Hoover's letter to Sir Edward
Ghey, dated December 22, follows:
"Sir: Knowing your keen desire to
mitigate in every possible way human
suffering arising out of the war, I
feel justified in bringing before you a
suggestion in bejialf of the civic popu
lation of Poland. I attach hereto a
petition which the commission has re
ceived from the large and representa
tive relief committee in Warsaw and
also a report made as a result of per
sonal investigation at our Instance by
Dr. Vernon Kellogg, until lately di
rector In Belgium of our work there.
Misery and Despair.
"No added words of mine can dark
en the picture of misery and despair
which these statements do, depicting
as they do what may be the fate of Bel
gium but for the relief afforded under
international auspices, with your eanr
est support. I have had some in
formal conversation with the German
authorities who have assured me that
there are cereals and potatoes avail
able in Poland and elsewhere . from
which by mobilization and organized
distribution some sort of minimum
ration can be provided. Other items
of a dietary do not exist -hi 1 -Poland
and. -they are-Varitically iecsea3r-to
preserve health to the strong and life
to the weak and to forefend from the
whole population already incipient
famine -and disease. The shortage of
these particular commodities in Ger
many leaves no hope of help fof Po
land from that quarter.
Protection Will Be Afforded.
"I am assured by the German au
thorities that protection will be afford
ed to local and imported supplies for
the exclusive use of the civilian popu
lation and also that every facility will
be afforded this commission in its ask
of organization and distribution under
proper guarantees.
"It appears to us that deficient fats,
beans, some breadstuffs, etc., together
with condensed milk for children, can
be obtained only fy imports from ov
erseas for which there would seem
to be a route practicable from the
western hemisphere to Sweden, with
traT:s-shipment thence via Danzig or
Libau. We would not undertake such
a task without the approval and co
operation of the allied governments.
Provisions For Food Supplies.
"In making provision for food sup
plies for these people we should need
not only to rely on charity, but to as
semble all the economic resources of
Poland and its institutions in much
the same manner as has been done in
Belgium and we should need the per
mission of His Majesty's government
to facilitate exchange and banking op
erations. Gravity of the Situation.
"The painful gravity of the situation
in Poland cannot be gainsaid, nor
need I apologize, for the interest this
organization has taken in the Polish
people, in addition to our other very
grave responsibilities. We have no
desire to add to our other burdens,
but if fourteen months' of service in
Belgium have commended us to the
various belligerent governments. It is
out duty to use the confidence thus ac
quired in behalf of the Polish people
and I wish to add that if the allied
governments are prepared to assent
to such relief measures and if any
other institution can be summoned to
undertake their execution, this com
mission would be glad to give any
advice arising out of its experience,
or alternatively, we should be glad to
incorporate such other body in any
organization might set up."
Sir Edward Grey's Letter.
Sir Edward Grey's letter to Mr.
Hoover, given out by the foreign of
fice, for publication, follows:
"Dear Mr. Hoover: I have careful
ly considered your letter of Decem
ber 2 regarding the proposed scheme
for the reliem of Poland. In the face
of accummulation evidence of German
and Austrian requisitions in Poland,
some mention of which you will find in
the enclosed telegraphic correspond
ence with Polish organizations in the
United States, I fear it would be im
possible to enter into any agreement
with you in regard to any scheme of
relief until the German and Austrian
governments have prohibited the ex
port of all foodstuffs shall not be
drawn upon to maintain the occupying
armies.
"If, and when, this was done It
might be possible to come to an . ar
rangement with you allowing of the
importation of certain articles in Po
land in return for undertakings on the
part of the German and Austrian gov
ernments to supply an adequate ra
tion and other necessary articles and
to give you a free hand In the distri
bution of stocks of foodstuffs .thus
made available.
"But prohibition of export and the
guarantees mentioned above must be
regarded as conditions precedent ""to
any discussion, since these measures
are demanded by the situation now ex
isting quite Independently of the ques
tion of imports and the fact that they
have not yet been put into foroe con
stitutes evidence that the German and
Austrian governments will never co
operate in any Tork undertaken In ths
interests of the population of Poland."

TO REDUCE INDEBTEDNESS
' . OF NEW HAVEN ROAD
From the Resources of ths Company-
Notes Maturing Msy 1.
Boston, Feb. 6. The indebtedness
of the New York, New Haven and
Hartford Railroad company, maturing
May 1, is to be reduced as much as
possible, from the. resources of the
company and the remainder renewed
upon the best terms obtainable, ac
cording to a statement of the action
directors made public today by Pres
ident Howard Elliott. The indebted
ness consists of $27,000,000 one-year 5
per cent, notes.
President Elliott says that as the
report of the Massachusetts public
service commission ordered last year
to investigate the road's financial af
fairs is expected in the latter part of
February, "it seems unwise at present
to attempt to make a mortgage and
issue bonds to take up the notes."
"It is hoped," says the statement,
"that the report will contain recom
mendations that will enable the legis
lature to take any action necessary
to remove any doubts as to the legal
status in Massachusetts of invest
ments of the company made by and
under lawful authority of other
states."
The csmmittee continues the state
ment, also considered the advisability
of recommending an increase in the
capital of the company by an issue of
the preferred stock, but "concluded
that it is not best to ask the stock
holders for action on any such plan
prior to May 1, although they feel
that the stockholders should give to
this method of raising money their
careful consideration so that debts
may be paid and needed improvements
be made promptly. No amount of new
stock, has ever been determined upon
and the report that $75,000,000 or any
other amount was to be raised is with
out foundation.
The statement says that the total
debts paid and new money put into
property in the last two and one-half
years was $12,056,716 and that during
the next few years much more than
this sum should be spent for addi
tions to the property.

TOWNS IN WESTERN ONTARIO
THROWN INTO A PANIC
By a Hurried Call to Arms of ths
' Horns Guard.
Niagara Falls, Ont., Feb. 6. Several
towns In western Ontario were thrown
into a panic late last night by a mar
ried call to arms of the home guard.
Buglers hurried through the streets,
sounding the alarm, and unfounded ru
mors that one of the bridges here had
blown up added to the- excitement.
At Saint Catherines theatre audi
ences were dismissed when the men
began to leave in response to the bugle
calls. Guards were doubled at a mu
nition plant there. No official at Saint
Catharines would say who ordered out
the guard, but it was understood there
to have been a general order through
out the province.
No orders were received to strength
en the guard on the bridges along ths
Niagara frontier. They have been un
der a heavy guard since September..
1914.
It is believed here that the excite
ment was due to some local cause and
that the calling out of the home guard
was on orders from an officer whose
command included Saint Catharines
and nearby towns. Following closely
upon tne Ottawa Are, tne hurried
mobilization threw the people into a
temporary panic, during which rumors
louna reaay circulation. v
