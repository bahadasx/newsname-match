All legislation is practically determin-,

London. I'cli. 7 (i-.'M u. in.)
There appears to be a urowiim be.
lief both in Paris and London that
the dermans ar,- preparing1 to launch
some important military movement
on the western front. For nearly a
fortnight increasing- German activity
has been reported along this line.
The Times says today that the
prt-.s&urr- of events may force the Ger
man staff to stake much to preserve
confidence at home and to stiffen the
troops by giving them an illusion ot
victory by a movement and the pos
sible occupation' of a few advance
line trenches.
"There have been several r. cent
indications after the enemy's artil-
lerv firing at various points." sas ,
the Times, "that it was intended to :
use German infantry to complete
some scheme or ether, but for reus-;
ons unknown they
deferred their vis-
it to our lines."
The Daily Graphic says:
"Kvery argument from the enemy
standpoint favors a great western of
fensive. The sweep through Serbia
has released several
hundred thous
and men for service under German
direction. For a month past near
Loos, Givenchy and Armentieres and
at other points, attacks have been
made with the evident object of find.
ing- a weak spot. Furthermore the I
whole theory of a successful war. ac-
cording to the general staff, is that.
the best form of defense is an attack.

Washington, Feb. d. President
Wilson and Secretary lanslnn are
expected to confer tomorrow on the
latest tentative, draft of the commun

the case uK.iln was promising was
received tonlirht from various diplo

The president, has had the tenta
tive draft before him since Friday
nlKht. In It, German (officials say,
the Rerlln foreign office has Rone a.i
lar as It possibly can to meet the po
sition of the United States. From
hlKh diplomatic quarters tonight
came the statement that Germany
believes that she has, with the in
ception of making an out and out
i disavowal of the Lusitarila sinking,
1 which she considers Impossible, con
. ceded every desire of th Untied
States and that the tentative pro

Admits, Responsibility,
In the latest proposal there Is no
uttempt to deny responsibility for the
sinking of the Lusitania. Hut Ger
many assumes liability for the Am
erican lives lost, offers reparation by
the payment of Indemnity nd as
sures tho United Htates that the kill
ing of Americans was without Intent.
The destruction of tho liner was an
ct of reprisal for the British block
ade under the orders In council, ac
cording to the German view, and re
prisals should not be applied to neu
trals. The tentative communication
also states that the method ot con
ducting submarine, wurfaiy In th"
,oth s. .1 has been modified because
of friendship for the United States
and I ause of the fact that Amurl-
run lives had been lost.
In this last connection, it was said
tonight that It was within the range
of possibilities that some reference
might be made In the preface of
the communication, should It be
transmitted formally to the United
States to he correspondence In the
