BERLIN S CONCESSION TO U. S
Statement Taken as Inferentially Ad
mitting Illegality of Sinking of
Lusitania Senator Stone Says
Case Is Practically Settled.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 7. It was announced to-day by Senator Stono
of Missouri, Clialnrmn of the Senato Committee on Foreign delations, aftor
ft conference with Administration officials, that tho Lueltaulu case waa
"praeUcally tsetUcd."
- ' Germany haa agreed that reprisals must not bo directed against any
other than enemy subjects. Tho cxprcsuion is offered ty Germany to tako
tho place of the phrase containing the word "Illegal," which waa Incor
porated in 4thc draft of tho Lusitania agrccmcnnow undor consideration.
This jnbjht;bo't4ken as Inferentially admlttlnR-Utat kllllak of neutrals was
Tho cjact languago of Wilson's note, 3 ,
Jiald to bavo been paraphrased by the
Gerjnau memorandum, follows:
't flllOJH'nd, Inhuman acts, how
ever JpJtlfjabU they may be
thouoht' (o be 'aoalnit an enemy,
who It believed to have acted Iri
contravention of law and human
ity, are manifestly Indefensible
when they deprive neutrals of
their acknowledned rights, par
ticularly ' when they violate the
rlaht of life Itself."
Several high officials said a more
choice of words would not bo permitted
to stand In tho way of success of the
Lusitania negotiations, and that the
United States would not Insist on the
use of the word "Illegal" or "dis
avowal" In Germany's acknowledge
ment that sinking of the liner was
without Justification.
Hocretnry Lansing donled that now
demands had hern mado nt a time
when tho German Government con
sidered the negotiations practically
wero at an end. He was. speaking of
tho Horlln despatches quoting the
references by Dr. VSImmormann, Ger
man Under Secretary of Forolgn
Affairs, to "new domnnds."
"This Government," said Secretary
Lansing; "has not increased tho de
mands made In the'Lusltunta case, as
et forth in the notes of May 13, Juno
9 and July 21. I doubt if Dr. Zlmmer
mann ever mado tho statement Umt
new demands had been Injected, bo
. cause ho must know that it Is utterly
' false."
(In an Interview with tho Asso
ciated Press, Dr. Alfred Zlramer
munn, Under Secretary for For
eign Affatrs, was quoted as fol
lows: I "Wo hud thought the submar
ine Issuo settlod and tho Lusi
tania question on the way to ar
rangement had agreed to pay in
demnity and all that when the
United Htutes suddenly made its
new demand, which It Is Impos
sible for us to accept."!
Secretary Lansing would not go
into details or dlBcusB Dr. Zlmmer
mann's statements further.
Secretary Lansing mude It known'
that the State Department considered.
tho situation unchanged. There was
no indication whether tho President
had decldod definitely whether Ger
many's latest proposal was satisfac
tory or unsatisfactory.
It became known to-day that Ger
many expresses tho hope that It may
have tho opportunity to co-operate
with tho United States In some action
looking toward the freedom of the
seas beforo the end of tho war. This1
statement Is takon In high diplomatic?
circles to Imply that the Berlin Gov,
ernment sees no occasion to await
the cessation of hostilities beforo set

Mrs, Hceso was described this
morning as a beautiful young woman
whoso parents nre among tho elite
of Ijob Angeles. Her husband h said
to have made a fortune In the auto

After n brief courtship, Reese al
