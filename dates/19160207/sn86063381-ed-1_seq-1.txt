local team Saturday puts Bemidji in
direct line for the title and a place
at Carleton for the state high school
championship. The only other strong
opponent in the Sixth district is the

ers will go to Brainerd to attend the
game. By defeating Brainerd, Be

this district.
Tanner Starts Game.
In the game Saturday night Be
midji started the scoring in the first
15 seconds of play when Johnson
passed the ball to Tanner who nego
tiated an easy shot. In less than an
other minute Tanner dribbled the ball
down the entire length of the floor
and secured another basket. A min
ule later and he duplicated his second
shot.
During the first half the Bemidji
men played excellent ball. All passes
were ect ivUe and 'be Lit+JLe Falls
quint appeared to be bewildered by
the speed of the local boys.
Speed Too Much.
Little Falls opened the game with
a burst of speed but was unable to
keep pace with the fast work of the
local boys.
The first half ended with the score
2 2 to 5.
During the second half the Little
Falls quint broke away for a short
time and secured four baskets. After
that, however, the game was very
much Bemidji's. The entire game
was fast and interesting despite the
onesidedness of the score.
The summary of the game is as fol

Nat Head and Paul H. Beaulieu of
the Red Lake Indian reservation will
go to Washington tonight to inves

against the Nelson forest reservation
bill on the Red Lake reservation.
Chief John Morrison will accom
pany the Red Lakers as a represen
tative from the Chippewa council. He
will also fight the Nelson bill which
deprives the Indians of Red Lake of
many of their rights.
"As long as the government just
pensions the Indians and does not
give them any rights," said Chief
Morrison today, "they will never be
any more than they are at present.
If they are given something to work
for they will undoubtedly advance
more rapidly. The Nelson bill does
a great injustice to the Indians of
the Red Lake reservation and I am
sure that anyone who reads the bill
intelligently will work against it."

Resistance Declares C.
Merritt.
Washington, Feb. 7.Edwin C.
Merritt, assistant commissioner of In
dian affairs, declared today that there
was no merit in the claim of the sa
loonkeepers of Hibbing that the Chip
pewa treaty of 1855 expired by limi
tation Feb. 14.
"I don't know where they find
ground for their contention," said
Mr. Merritt. "There is nothing in
the treaty limiting its duration in
point of years. On the other hand,
section 7 specifically provides that
certain laws shall apply until con
gress directs otherwise. That sec
tion is as follows:
Nothing in Treaty.
Laws which have been or may be
enacted by congress regulating trade
and intercourse with Indian tribes,
are to continue and be in force with
in and upon the several reservations
provided herein, and those portions
of said laws which prohibit the in
troduction, manufacture, use of, and
traffic in, ardent spirits, wines, or
other liquors, in the Indian country,
shall continue and be in force with
in the entire boundaries of the coun
try herein ceded to the United States,
until otherwise provided by congress.
"That section covers not only the
liquor traffic within the territory
covered by the treaty, but also ap
plies to the entire subject matter
of the treaty and makes congress the
only power that can change any of
the provisions.
Opening Would Be Fought.
"The supreme court upheld the
validity of section 7 in the opinion
in the case of Johnson against Jer
rold, in Which Jerrold,' a saloonkeep
er at Bemidji, attempted to prevent
the Indian bureau from closing the
saloons in that city. Any attempt
to open the saloons there on Feb. 14
or any other date, in the absence of
congressional action, will be resisted
by the Indian office.
Mr. Merritt's opinion that there is
no time limit on the treaty of 1855
was supported by Senator Knute Nel
son and Representative Clarence B.
Miller of Duluth, former member of
the committee on Indian affairs, in
Vv-hose district Hibbing is included.
Senator Nelson said: "I cannot
find any merit in the contention that
the treaty will expire Feb. 14."
