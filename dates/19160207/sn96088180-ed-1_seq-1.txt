Portland, Feb. 7. Because ta
Columbia and Willamette river are
playing a game of see-saw, no dis
astrous floods were anticipated aa a
result ot the quick thaw which loir
lowed the unusually heavy now
storms ot the pant month.
Although the upper Willamette was
on a rampage, naa yaaseu u
stage at many points, and waa rising
rapidly this afternoon, river men pre
dicted that no great damage will re
sult.
The thaw melted snow chiefly la
the valleys. The channel or tne wu
lamette river can easily carry away
all this water, because the Columbia
river is low and a swift current .
running. ,.
, By the, time floods strike the Col
umbia, the Willamette, torrent will
have subsided. It was predicted
Water will cover the lower docks la
Portland, but will not flood water
front streets -because the baek water .
from the Columbia is lacking.
A stage. of, 16.5 feet by Thursday
was predicted' by the weather bureau.
River bottom farms throughout the
entire valley will be flooded, -but they
meet this fate every year. ;
Three warnings were Issued by the
local west&er bureau today. They
were against nigh water along ta
river front, avalanches In the moun
tains and a storm off the Oregon coast
which may endanger small craft.
Schools were opened in Portland
today tor the first time since last
Tuesday, when the snow and sleet
storm forced them to close.
Portland, Fob. 7. With the upper
Willamette river rising several Inchea
an hour, Portland shippers today be
gan moving their good away from

A warm chlnook wind swept the en
tire valley during the night, melting
the snow which .has covered3 the
ground for a month and sending a
torrent down every gulley. The creat
of the flood was near Corvallis today.
At Eugene Amazon slough over
flowed yesterday, flooding a portion
of the city. .
The quickest thaw on record, strik
ing one of the heaviest snows on
record waa expected to bring unpre
cedented floods.
From the headwaters to the mouth
ot the Willamette a rapid thaw and
rising waters were reported. At Rose-
burg the Umpqua was 'said to be on
a rampage. At Canyonvllle the moun
tain streams were running bank-full.
Outside the Willamette valley the
thaw was not so rapid. Great dam
age to fruit trees was feared at Hood
