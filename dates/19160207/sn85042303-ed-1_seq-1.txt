blood, and the people feel confident
that they will be able to cope with
this most critical Hood test.

every city w hich the Mississippi flood
waters would strike.

only land in sight at Arkansas City.
On one side is the great river, swol
len until Its surface Is fifteen feet
above the level of the town. On
the oilier side of the levee is a great
lake formed by flood waters that have
poured down from the north through
a half dozen breaks in the Arkansas
river levees. Tills lake is nearly forty
miles loiitf and twenty miles wide.
From it only the upper stories of
buildings in Arkansas City protrude.
At the levee are three steamboats
ready to carry the plucky fighters to
safety should they lose their battle
with the Hood. They are living In
the second stories of their homes and
in box cars on the levee.
