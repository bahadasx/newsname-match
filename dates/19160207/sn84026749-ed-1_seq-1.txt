Four of the conferees on the ur
g6nt deficiency appropriation bill,
to which has been tacked the lew
lands amendment holding up the
construction of the Government's
heat, light, and power plant, jump
ed into "Uncle Joe" Cannon.'s au
tomobile today and visited the
site of the proposed plant near the
Bureau of Engraving and Printing
building.
Senators Martin and Bryan and
Congressmen Fitzgerald and Can
non decided to visit the site, in
view" of the protests that the erec
tion of the power plant there
would "disfigure" the Mall and in
terfere with the beautification of
Washington.
SAID tO FAVOR PLANT.
The conferee ha.'v&jjpt. yet reached"
the Newlands amendment In the den

night or tomorrow. As -published in
'Hie Sunday Evening Times, the House
conferees are expected to stand unitedly
against the Newlands amendment. Mr.
Fitzgerald, In particular. Is understood
to be antagonistic to any legislation
that would halt the work on the plan
now that the contract has been let ana
the wojrk of breaking ground has begun
Mr. Fitzgerald, who, as chairman or
the House Appropriations Committee,
will be an Influential member In the
conferences over the bill, regards the
opposition as belated, and the objcotlons
to the plant as not sufficiently serious
to Justify invalidating the contract.
House To Back Fitzgerald.
The virtual charge In a statement by
Assistant Secretary Newton that the
Potomac Electric Light and Power
Company is responsible for much of the
agitation In connection with the pro
posal to build a Government plant to
furnish heat, light, and power to the
several departments, will have Its ef
fect if the Newlands amendment comes
to a Vote in. the House.
It Is believed the House will stand be
hind Mr. Fitzgerald In his opposition to
the Newlands' amendment and If the
Scnato Insists upon It, the lower cham
ber Is likely to instruct Its conferees to
temaln firm In their opposition. Feeling
among many members of the House Is,
as was suggested yesterday In The
Times, that the sole beneciary. In case
construction of the plant is held up will
lie the Potomac Company, which gets
thousands yearly from the Government
for electricity.

BOARD
Fight May Be Forced
At any Moment Now
Over Sheppard Bill
Opponents of District Prohibition Planning Motion
to Recommit Measure or Force Amendment
Providing for Referendum on Question.
The battle in the Senate over the Sheppard bill for prohibition
in the District may be precipitated any day.
It was learned today that, although it is generally expected the
Sheppard bill will not be brought up until the water power' bill is dis
posed of, the opponents of the measure may at any time make a
motion to recommit it to the Committee on the District to have
hearings.
MOTION WOULD FORGE VOTE.
Such a motion, which would probably
be made by Senator Blair Leo of Mary
land, or Senator James of Kentucky,
wno are leaders In the fight against a
"dry" District, would at oncoipreclpl-
tate the struggle over the prohibition
question, as it would force a vote.
It Js the hope of the opponents of the
1)111 cither to get It sent back to tho
District Committee for the ostcnslblo
purpose of holding hearings or to hitch
to tho bill a provision for a referendum.
If the bill Is sent back to the commit
tee, the plan Is to hold It there for the
rest of tho session If possible, or. If
that cannot be done, to hold It back un
til It can bo blocked In the Jam of legis
lation at the 'end of the session.
The water power bill is the unfin
ished business before , the Senate.
Senator Cheppard. author of the DIs
tilet prohibition bill, has given no
tlcc he will move to take It up as
toon us the power bill Is out of tho
wayi Hut this does not prevent
some of tho1 Senators hostile to pro
hibition t.iaklng u motion to recom
mit. Advocates of prohibition for the
District arc on the alert In order that
they may not bo caught napping by
a motion to recommit tho hill. Thev
are aware that the bill was reported
out of the District Committee hn.
cauie Its opponents were caught nan-
ping, ana mev lo not want to havo
the tables turned
"We shall fight the proposed referen
dum." said Senator Sheppard ti,day
"It Is an adroit move, but It Is veil
known there Is no machinery here In
Washington for voting on such a ques
tion' UN

Commissioners Send Adverse
Report to Congress on Lo
beck Measure.
Declaring their belief that there Is
no public necessity for such legisla
tion, the Commissioners sent to Con
gress today an adverse report on the
bill Introduced by Congressman Lo
beck to regulate the construction and
operation of elevators In the District.
The bill makes It a misdemeanor
punishable by fine to Install or oper
ate a passenger, elevator In the Dis
trict unless an automatic device to
prevent the car from being moved
In either direction while any gate or
door on any platform is open is first
Installed. No particular device Is
mentioned In the bill.
The Commissioners say It Is their
opinion that "Instead of placing a
premium on carelessness of an oper
ator by the Installation of an auto'
matlc door-locking device, the oper
ator should be educated, examined,
and placed under such supervision
that he will become a highly effici
ent employe."
Directing attention to the weekly
examinations of applicants for li
censes to operate elevators, the board
states, "the operators are now of
such Intelligence and tinder such con
trol as to add materially to the safe
ty of elevators under their charge."
An adverse report was made also on
the bill Introdficed by Congressman
Buchanan to amend the building regula
tions so as "to provide for the better
protection of persons engaged In and
about the construction, repairing, alter
ation, or removal of bridges or build
ings, viaducts, and other structures."
Tho Commissioners say that under the
act of June 14, 1878, authorizing them to
make and enforce such building regula
tions as they deem advisable, they be
lieve, they have ample authority to reg
ulate the matters covered by the pro
posed legislation.
With the proviso that the siding shall
be maintained by the Philadelphia, Bal
timore, and Washington Railroad Com
pany and Its successors "to the satis
faction of the Commissioners and at
the sole cost nnd expense of James !'.
.Barbour and his successors, and that
Congress shall reserve the right to re
quire the railroad to remove the siding
at any time without compensation," the
Commissioners sent a favorable report
on Senate bill 6t to authorize the main
tenance and use by James K. Barfcour
and ht successors in title or a rail
road siding from the tracks of the rail
road company across Kour-and-a-hair
streot southwest Into certain lots
owned by him In Square M6.
Senator Galllnger introduced In the
Senate this afternoon an amendment to
the District appropriation bill providing
tor W0,000 to grade .Massachusetts ave

On motion of Senator Lodge, the Sen
ate this afternoon named Alexander
Graharn Bell as regent of the Smith
sonian Institution to succeed himself.

Judiciary Committee
Hears Plan to Bar
Shipping of Liquor
A new phase of the effort to strike
at alcoholic liquors came up in the
Senate Judiciary Commltte today.
That committee H considering the
Sheppard resolution containing the
proposed national prohibition amend
ment. It was discussed nt lengJ.li
today. f
Senator Dillingham proposed to the
committee an amendment In the na
ture of a substitute which would shut
alcoholic liquors out of Interstate
commerce This plan of dealing with
the liquor question ha been more
or less discussed, but heretofore It
has not got to the point of serious
consideration by a responsible com
mittee. Under the decisions of the Supreme
Court, it Is urged, Congress has am
ple power to exclude alcoholic liquors
from Interstate commerce.

ETTLEWIENT
OF LUSITANIA
CASE SEEN BY
II S. OFFICIALS
Administration Leaders Look
for Acceptance of terms
Within 24 Hours, Unless
Wilson Rejects Them.
Government Inclined to Be Sat
isfied With Phrase Used in
Lieu of Outright Admission
of Illegality.
Definite settlement of the Lusi
tania controversy is now in sight.
This prediction comes today
from high official sources.
Unless President Wilson, within
the next twenty-four hours, re
jects the proposals from Berlin it
is confidently expected by Admin
istration leaders that these propos
als will be made the basis of a for
mal agreement. Optimism is
rowing hourly.
From present indications the
United States will be inclined to
accept the phrase used by the Ger
man government in lieu of the out
right admission that its attack on
the Lusitania was "illegal."
INCLINED TO ACCEPT.
That Is to sav, the Government -Is In
clined ta nccept the admIslon'athat In
asmuch as Americans were killed when,
the attack wnslmade, the act should
not have been committed.
Resentful of reports from Berlin
quoting Under Secretary Zimmerman,
of the Berlin foreign office us charging
the United States with having Increased
its demands at tho last moment. Secre
tary Lansing today dictated the follow
ing statement.
"This Government has not Increased
Its demands In the Lusitania case as set
forth In the notes of May 13. June 9,
and July 21. I doubt very much If Dr.
Zimmerman ever made such a state
ment as he must know It to be utterly
false."
It Is regarded as significant that Sec
retary Lansing did not say that tho
American government may not reduce
Its demands.
Stone Not Apprehensive.
Senator William J. Stone, chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee, conferred today with Secretary of
State lousing and the President. His
vlBlt to the President, he said, was nn
another matter. But as he left the
White Honsc he said-
"The newspapers indicate a settle
ment, do they not? Well " 'and he
smiled broadl "I. myself am not at
all apprehensive."
The definite decision of the Adminis
tration Is expected to be renched at a
conference which tho President and
Secretary Lansing will have this after
noon or evening. In the meantime no
formal announcement Is forthcoming, and
no engagement has been made for
another conference between tho Secre
tary and Count von Bernstorff.
It Is expected that such an announce
ment may be made after tomorrow's
meeting of tho Cabinet
In the view of German officials the
admission In the tentative settlement
proposals now before the President that
the killing of Americans on the Lusi
tania was unjustified will meet the
wishes of the United States. The other
point, that Germany will pay Indemnity
for Lusitania victims as an obligation,
noit as an act of grace, Is acceptable to
tho United States.
The communication before the Presi
dent Is a note which lacks only the sig
nature of the German ambassalor to
give It the form of a formal document.
Count von Bernstorff has canceled all
his engagements out of the city and is
waiting to be called bv Secretary Lan
sing for a conference to bring the ne
gotiations to a close.
London Evewing Papers
Hold Widely Different
Views on Lusitania Case
LONDON. "Feb. 7.-The London after
noon newspapers expressed widely di
vergent views today on the German
American situation, arising out of Ger
many's refusal to disavow the Lusitania
sinking.
"It Is follv to expeot war when the
affair Is reduced to a mere quarrel over
words," said the Pall Mall Gazette.
"We nre unable to Imagine America
consenting to nccept mere financial sat
isfaction for tho lives of helpless citi
zens," said the Globe.
The Birmingham Post said It must
be admitted that the situation jiad
reached a crisis, in which one side or
the other must back down.

Mrs. Dawson, attired In a tailored
suit, brown shoes, and automobile coat,
told Judge Strarsburger that she would
defend her own case. She Prfct told her
rtory as a witness, then crosi-e.xamlned
Enoch A. Chaso, tho plaintiff, and sum
med up her case, much at. a veteran
lawyer might have done.
Several times Mrs. Dawson tried to
Interrupt Mr. Chase's argument.
"That has been the whole trouble
with Mrs. Dawson, your honor,"aald
Mr. Chase, who was pacing up and
down the floor. "8ho has always had
her own way, but she can't have It now
and I don't want her to Interrupt me."
"Hasn't that always been your ex
perience with women''" asked Judge
Strassburger. and both the plaintiff and
the defendant Joined In the laugh.
Complimented By Judge.
At the conclusion of the eas Mrs
Dawson apologized f.r her lacl: of
legal knowledge and for a slightly for
eign accent, which she said might have
resulted in causing her to be misunder
stood. "You have made yourself oui rib
and vour case has not been prejudiced
either by your defense or by your ac
cent." replied the Judge.
Justice Strassburgvr decided s.'alnst
Mrs. Dawson, awarding Mr. Chsse HO.
which waa the churge he originally
Placed upon his service, and assessed
the coats upon Mrs. Dawson. '
Tho rase related ta.thoef arts of Mrs. '
DawBon to have Mrs. 'Kmma L. Voder
ejected front the prcmlies at 1K0 Park
road, and the refusal of Mr. Chaso to
servo notice of electment because of tho
approaching death of Charles P. Yodcr
on Spptcmber .10 last.
In Riving his decision Justice Strass
burpcr said that the laws In the District
of Columbia aro defective, in that they
give the tenant cvrv right mil rho
landlord vcr few rights. He told Mrs.
Dawson that In many cases tenants
have remained In possession for six
months or more after landlords wished
them ejected, through appealing their
cases.
Enumeration of Services.
Mr. Chase's enumeration of his serv
ices Included a claim against a Boston
defendant and "the matter of a servant
who threatened gossip, the matter of
police court attendance for speeding
automobile; suit against Mrs. M. L.
Yoder. complaint against estate of
Charles P. Yoder. deceased; inspection
of house at 1K0 Park road for alleged
damages "
Mr. Chase said he had been called
upon by Mrs. Dawson to Interview a
servant who had left her and threaten
ed to spread malicious gossip. He also
said he had been requested to appear
In Police Court to defend a caso in
which she was arrested for violating
the speed regulations.
She May Appeal Case.
When he renched Police Court, ho
said, he was told that Mrs. Dawson had
put up collateral at the Police Station
and forfeited It.
Mrs. Dawson said that the bill had
only been rendered January 8. and that
Mr. Chaso hnd brought suit January 31
before she had time to consult with ad
visers as to whether the amount was
justified. She claimed that tyy declining
to serve nn Injectment notice, and by
receiving rent he had prejudiced the
chances of her getting the owners
ejected, and of her leasing the house to
other tenants.
Justice Strassbcrger explained to Mrs.
Dawson that she might appeal her case
within six days, and she told him ho
thought she would do so.

New Spy Rumors Heard as
Canada's Parliament Meets
. to Ferret Conspiracy.
OTTA.WA. Ontario, Feb. 7. Sensa
tional reports of the- discovery of new
German plots are Jn circulation as Par
liament prepared to assemble this after
noon to discuss the origin of the fire
that destroyed the Canadian Parliament
buildings.
From Brldjteburg came the report
Canadian guards had fired on a rowboat
which approached the International
bridge early today The guards were
immediately doubled, on the suspicion
thst an attempt was being made to
dynamite tho bridge spanning the Ni
agara between Brldgeburg and Buffalo.
The rowbsat pulled hastily for the
American shore.
The Ninth Overseas Battalion, of 1.156
men. arrived at Welland todav to re-enforce
two other regiments guarding the
Wetland canal and munition plants In
that vlclnltv. 'Reported plots to destroy
the canal, through which passes millions
of bushels of Canadian wheat, destined
for the allies, led General Logle. of To
ronto, to place heavier guards.
Soldier guards todav went on duty at
munition plants at St. Catharines. On
tario. Lieutenant Colonel JJurlelch made hur-
ried trios until dawn todav. disposing
aimed detachments aboufc the factories.
Previously civilians had guarded the
plants, and requests for military guards
had been refused. Burleigh told news
paper men that the r-aso.i for the
change mav bo made known In a state
ment given out In a dav or two.
Ext a sentries were placed at the pub
lic buildings at Fort Colborne. through
out the uleht.
Orders weio Issued todav that here
after the canal and all bridges shall bo
guarded both day and night.
Premier Borden will tell Parliament
this afternoon that the authorities are
conducting a rigid Investigation of re
ports that the Parliamentary building
lire was of Incendiary origin, and will
give assurance that every precaution is
being taken to guard buildings against
Teutonic plotters.
Dispatches received here tend to prove
the existence of a German plot to In
vade Canada for the purpose of destroy
ing the Welland Canal, jhe object of
which Is to prevent the shipment of
wheat to the allied governments.
Other facts revealed by a secret In
vestigation, which has been prosecuted
for weeks In this city and in Connecti
cut. Include the amazing developments
that approximately 200.000 rifles hov
been purchased by German agents end
that these weapons are being sent by
stealth to the Canadian border.

Instructions Broad Enough
to Permit Surveillance Over

Secretary of th Navy Daniels
said today that the extra precau
tions taken to guard the Brooklyn
and Manhattan bridges to prevent
bomb attacks on vessels passing
under them were suggested by the
Navy Department after it had re
ceived warning of danger.
Two letters were received from
