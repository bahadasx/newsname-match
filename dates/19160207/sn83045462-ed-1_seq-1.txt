ing *.o an official statement issued in t<

. The statement also recounts the bringing
down in flames of a (Jerman aeroplane
after an engagement with a
French battleplane.
# There appears to be a growing belief p]
both in Paris and London that tha Tier- c
mans are preparing to launch some SI
important military movemenw on iue
western front. For nearly a fortnight '
i4
Increasing German activity has been
reported along this line. 1>
a
Attack May Be Forced. m
The Times says that the pressure of tI
vents may force the German staff to si
stake much to preserve confidence at
home and to stiffen the troops by
giving them an illusion of victory by
a movement and the possible occupalion
of a few advance line trenches.
"There have been several recent in- ^
di cations after the enemy's artillery
firing at various points," says the
Times, "that it was intended to use
German Infantry to complete some
scheme or other, but for reasons un- n
known they deferred their visit to our C
lines." c<
Time for German Effort.

The Daily Graphic says: j K
"Every argument from the enemy ! H
standpoint favors a great western of- ! ?
t Tensive. The sweep through Serbia
; s released several hundred thousand v\
men for service under German direc- ^
tiou. For a month past near Loos, Givencliy
and Armentieres and at other
points attacks have been made with
the evident object of finding a weak . _
spot. Furthermore, the whole theory
of a successful war, according to the P
general staff, is the best form of de- C
fense is an attack. On the political a
side tjhere is necessity to convince Ger- is
* man and Austrian public opinion that
something decisive is near."

i- becomes law, stop the construction

among architects and enginee
throughout the country that the loc;
e tion of the heating and power plant <
the site chosen would mar the beau
of that part of Washington and b
come an eyesore to the capital ai
nation. They urged that the Pre?

s thorough investigation has been ma
by the fine arts commission, aided 1
j competent engineering experts.
si Fear a Grave Blunder.

a grave bunder may be made and th
this blunder ought not be permitt<

i- In some quarters among architec
n there is said to be an impression th
a modification of the building, to i
away with the high smokestack
might obviate the troubles that a
feared, but today's visitors did n
11 present this side to the President. Th<

intrenched on the western frontier i
within fifty yards of the Austro-Hungarian
lines. 1
It is also stated, the correspondent
says, that the central powers have de- j
manded "a neutrality favorable to the
central powers" as well as the demob- i
ilization of the Rumanian army.

No New Demands Made
on Germany in Lusitania
Case, Mr. Lansing Says
Secretary Lansing today flatly
denied that new demands had
been made in ilie Lusitania case
at a time when the Herman government
considered the negotiations
practically were at an end.
He was speaking of the Berlin
dispatches (|uoting the references
by Dr. Zimmerman. (Jerniau under
secretary of foreign affairs, to
"new demands."
. "This government." said Secretary
Lansing, "has not increased
the demands made in the Lusitania
case as set forth in the notes
of May f^v June <) and July 21. I
doubt if Dr. Zimmerman ever
made the statement that new demands
had been injected, because
he must know that it is utterly'
false."'
Declines to Do Into Details.
Secretary Lansing would not go into dotails
or discuss Dr. Zimmerniann's statement
further. When Dr. Zimmerniann's
statement was published in this country,
however, his reference to new demands
was taken to apply to a possible construe
tion on the word "illegal in tne propoeeu
form of settlement. The only ground
American officials could find for construing
that as embodying a new demand was the
possibility that it might be considered applicable
not alone to i:ie destruction of
neutrals on tne l.usitania, but also a*
to the method by which she.was sunk.
Secretary l^a using repeated that he expected
to confer with President Wilson
some time during the day. It was said
at the White House that it was doubtful
whether the conference could be held before
some time this afternoon, as tt?o
President had other engagements.
Calls Situation Unchanged.
Secretary Lansing made it known,-,
however, that the State Department
considered the situation unchanged.
Chairman Stone of the Senate foreign
relations committee said after talking
with administration officials that his
impression was the Lusitania case was
"practically settled." He did not go
into details. Secretary .Lansing, however,
indicated that some announcement
might be given out for publication
within the n at few days.
There was no indication whether the
President had definitely decided
whether Germany's latest proposal was
satisfactory or unsatisfactory.
Administration officials let it be
known that a mere choice of words
would not be permitted to stand In tbo
way of success of the negotiations and
that the United States will not insist
