PARK BOARD TO
OPPOSE SOUTH
AVENUE CLOSING
Heirs of Horace Smith Es
tate May Be Entitled To
Return of Land.
Opposition from the members of
the park board,residents of the South
End, the heirs" of the Horace Smith
estate as well as from many voters
in the second and third districts is ex
pected tonight when the ' petition of
the Crane Co-, to close the lower end
of South, avenue, from Iranistan ave
nue to Barnum dyke and the Barnum
dyke from Iranistan avenue to Wal
demere avenue comes up for, a hear
ing. This is the second time this
petition has been before the common
council.- - , ' , ,
The Crane Co. purchased the land
on both sides of South avenue from
the Horace Smith Estate Inc., - the
heirs to which are Horace W.. Smith,
Mrs.' William Demterest and Mrs. John
Foster of New .York. Tljey are also
the principal . stock holders ; in the
Wheel & Wood Betiding Co.'. in 'John
street. About ' eighteen months ' ago
when the Crane Co. petitioned . the
common' council . fo. permission to
close the street it did not own the
property known . as the mud flats at
the foot of South avenue. This is
the property which extends along the
Barnum dyke. ; The Crane Co. since
has acquired . the property 'but the
Horace Smith Estate Inc. holds a
mortgage on it. ' .
The Horace Smith estate heirs gave
that part of South avenue to the city
and some residents of the South end
Claim that it was . given with the un
derstanding that it was always, to be
used as a public highway or else the
land was to revert to the estate. The
attorneys for the Smith estate are now
looking up this matter.
A petition against the closing of the
street has been circulated and has the
signatures of more than 100 residents
of the South end. This petition will
be presented to the council tonight.
The park commission has a plan to
continue South avenue through to
i meet the park ' drive way which it is
proposed to extend to Fayerweather's
I Island. Alderman Harry A.' Lewis
and John Renchi of the Third . district
are also advocating a bridge from the
foot of Howard avenue to Join the
Fayerweather's Island boulevard.

Whether or not any serious viola

things have been discovered, is not
known. It has transpired however,
that two policemen who failed to re
port to a fire in the West End, in
which their beats were, have - been
transferred to less desirable beats.
The policemen knew of the fire, ac
cording to reports.
President John C. Stanley cf the
board of commissioners, addressed the
men at headquarters last night and
reminded them of, the rule. Superin

morning that he didn't know or any
infraction that may have caused the
occurrence.
According to information that has
been given the police, the commission

"No matter what decision had been
made, neither side would have emerg

decided that the court had the right

done.
"I want to say that in all the pre

the way of success of the negotiations
and that the United States will not in-,
sist on thuse.of the word "illegal" or
"disavowal" in " Germany's acknowl- t
edgement ithat ,the Sinking of the liner
without 'warning, and the loss of 115
American lives, was wrong." '
Inasmuch as the proposal now be- .
fore President. Wilson' and Secretary
Lansing is described In German quar
ters as substituting for the Word "illeg
al" a phrase which Germany hopes
would ' beC acceptable .to rthe United i
States. as covering the same point with- i
out humiliating Germany and having !
regard for public opinion in that coun-.;
try, thjs announcement was . taken as
strengthening the ' optimistic atmos
phere which surrounds the negotia
tions and plpssibly leaving- open the
wav to continued negotiations.
The principal consideration of the
United States; now is .that there shall (
be 'an acknowledgement by Germany j
that' the sinking of an j unresisting.!
merchantman without . warning is in ;
contravention of International law and
that such naval warfare shall be per-;
manently discontinued- ' The Ger
man contention is . that such - assur
ances already have been given in the( -AraHln
se and that all that remains
in the Lusitania case is reparation for
the lives" of neutrals and an acknowl
edgement that it was, wjsong to destroy,
them t ' i
This latter is contained in- the, Ger-,

Lansing on September 1 1915, was as

"My jdear: Secretary: i :
"With-reference to ottr-conversfttlon-j
of this morning, I 'beg to inform you
.that my instructions concerning . our
answer, to , your . last , Lusitania. note
contains the following passage.: , -
" "Liners will not be sunk by our
submarines"; without " warning "ani'
without safety of the ' fives of non-:
combatants, provided that the liners
do not try to escape or offer resist- i
ance. r
"Although I know you do not wish
to discuss the Lusitania question until
the Arabic- incident has been defi
nitely and satisfactorily settled, I de
sire to inform you of the above be-''
cause this policy of my goverfVnent
was decided on before the Arabic in
cident occurred.-
"I have no objections to your mak
ing any use you please of the above
information.
"I remain my dear Mr. Lansing,
. ' "Very sincerely yours,
"J. BERNSETORFF."
At that time, Secretary Lansing .
would only say: "That is view of its
clearness it seemed needless to make
any comment in regard to it," other
than to say it appeared to be a "recog
nition of the fundamental principles '
for which we have contended."

nied that new demands had been made ,
