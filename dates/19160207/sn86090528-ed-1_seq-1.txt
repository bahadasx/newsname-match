Take View that Trial Judge Docided Case

to Pay Two Salaries is
Pointed Out
The commisisoners of Grady county
convened in regular monthly session
this morning with all members of th3
tommisbion, the county clerk, the
county uttorney and the assistant
county attorney present.
Immediately following the meeting
nf the board the county attorney, Mr.
Venal. le, asked that the commission
ers adopt the following resolution:
"lie fore the board of county co:u
mlHsioners of Grady county.
"In rel. appeal of the cuse of State
cf Oklahoma, plaintiff, vs. F. 1. Brad
ley, defendant, pending in the district
coert of Grady county.
"lie it resolved by the board of
county commissioners of Grady
county. Oklahoma, that the county at
torney of Crad county, Oklahoma, is
hereby authorized to appeal the case
of State of Oklahoma vs. F. P. Brad
ley to the supreme court of the state
or Oklahoma, anil that the county
clerk of Grady county is hereby au
tliorzed to draw warrants sufficient
to pay the expense of inch appeal. .
"Chairman Board of County Com
mloners."
Whereupon the board of commis
sioners, in session assembled, made
he following order as a part of the
record of the day's proceedings:
"Above resolution was Introduced
by J. If. Vena'nlo, county attorney.
After due consideration of said reso
lution it was, on motion,
"Ri'Hdvfcd, That the board do here
by deny tile request a presented and
that the case as set out to dropped
where it is, and the county attorney
infracted to tJkc no further action
Jn the niauer."
A roll call on the above resulted in
a unanimous vote of "Yes" in favor of
dropping all further action In the mut
ter of the State of Oklahoma vs. F. V.
Bradley.
When the resolution, introduced by
County Attorney Jobr. Vtnable, asking
that, the board ot county commisison
ers authorize th? appeal to tne sl''
preme court Ol Die Bradley matter
came up before the board this morn
ing, Chairman Corzine of the board
Hated thai h ilia not favor the adop
tion of the resolution.
Mr. Corzine stated that Judge Cham
Jones, who had acted in the matter,
was known as one of the most thor
ough lawyers In Oklahoma; that he
is a Jurist of known ability; that his
recoid as a district j'.:lse shows a
minimum of cases reversed by the su
preme court add that he did not see
that the county would pain anything
by paying for the appeal of the case
Ccmmisisoner Bryant stated that he
entertained the same views In the
matter; that clearly the trial judge
Knew what he was doing when ho
held that Bradfey had not been ad
judged guilty in face of the testimony
of the state's witnesses and tint, such
being the case, ho was not in favor
of the county spending any more
money In the mp.tter.
Commissioner Robinson stated thzt
he felt the supreme court would up
hold the action of the lower, or trial
court and that untold litigation would
only result in piling up costs to th
county. Mr. Robinson said further
tliat the appeal would probably mean
Mr. Bradley would bo removed from
office pending the adjudication of that
appeal and that, with the sustaining
or the action of the lower court by the
supreme judiciary, Mr. Bradley would
be again reinstated and would be en
titled to collect, full salary for the time
he was restrained from office. This
would mean, Mr. Robinson said, the
paying of a double Balnry, a salary to
1re seiine clerk and a salary to Mr.
Bradley and w-ou'2 cM.be in the in
terests of cconoy or "gov govern-
went.
Each member of the commission
seemed to think the trial Judge should
know more about the law than th
county commissioners; that he had
informed himself upon the law in such
cases and that he had evidently look
ed up proper authorities before he
had rendered his decision giving judg
ment to the defendant, Bradley, and
reinstating him.
Reports of county officers were
received for the month of January. It
being shown that the accounts had
been duly audited it was resolved that
1 lie same be adopted with correction?
as noted.
The county attorney was authorized
to appeal "mileage" cases of sheriff's
officers, the district court having held
that the officer serving criminal pro
cess should be entitled to 100 per cen:
of the mileage allowed, according to
statute, in all cases wherein the
county had to pay the costs.
The county clerk was instructed to
purchase three copies of the revised
i-esslon laws of the slate.

Grand Jury Report.
Your grand jurors, duly impanel
ed and sworn in and for Grady county,
Oklahoma, beg leave to submit here
with the following report:
First. SVe have diligently inquired
into all law violations occurring in
and triable within Grady county,
Oklahoma, and submit herewith cer
tain indictments which we have
found.
Second. We have inquired into the
cause of the death of one Sir. Heib
ing, who died in one o' the cells of
the county jail from suffocation and
burns, and from such investigation
we find that his death came from hi3
own act and that Hodge Bailey, sher
iff, and his deputies and "Mr. Dryden,
jailor, are without blenie for hi3
death, and should be exonerated from
any and all blame for his death.
Third. SVe have Inquired into
matters relating to the construction
and cost of construction of about a
mile and a half ot road just east ot
the city of Chickasha and west of
the toll bridge across the Washita
river, and from such investigation wy
believe that the cost of the construc
tion of such road is excessive, that the
same was built without competent
and proper supervision: and we find
that proper provision was not made
for laborers on said road and prefer
ence shown as to the pay and wage3
of certain ones; that the county com
missioners ot this county have not
used due precaution In provln? the
correctness of the claims filed by
parties -working on said road before
allowing the same; and we suggest
that all claims he required to U
fully Itemize A as to dates, amounts,
the place of performance of
ices and all matters relating
serv-there-
to.
We further show that your gr-d
jurors have adjourned sine die.
