WASHINGTON, D. C Feb. 7.
Secretary of State Lansing today de
clared that the .statement that Amer
ica had Increased her demands In the
Lusltanla case Is untrue. The state
ment is attributed to Under Secretary
or Foreign Affairs Zimmerman at Ber-
! itn, and it Is not thought here that
.Zimmerman made the statement.
I "The government has not Increased
i its demands as they wero set forth
i last year," said Lansing todays "I
j doubt ir that statement was 'ever
t made by Zimmerman."
J The report gives the Lusltanla con-
troversy a sensational turn. It la be-
1
llevcd that It bodes ill for the hopes
J of Germany that the American ad-
ministration might compromise.
The German embassy today said It
had no knowledge of Zimmerman
making the statement credited to him.
"We do not know whether he anld
it, or why, if he did. This may hnve
! been given out In Berlin as some 'crl-
J sis' rumors are here."
The Germans say that tentative
. proposals regarding the Lusltanla af
ifair offer an entire agreement from
the American viewpoint. President
jWilson has not as yet examined the
lost memorandum prepared by Berns
torff.
