PUIS IMPROVEMENT
TO POSTOFffi HERE
Bill Reaches Congress for
Money to Enlarge Local
Government Building.
$60,000 IS ASKED FOR
House Committee Gets Rep
resentative Shackleford's
Financial Measure.
Columbia is to have a postolllce ad
equate to handle the large amount of
mail which daily comes into this city,
if a hill introduced in the House of
Representatives January 11 by Con
gressman Dorsey W. Shackleford of
this district passes. The bill was re
ferred to the House committee on
public grounds and buildings.
The bill, a copy of which has just
been received in Columbia, reads as
follows:
"A bill for the extension, remodel
ing and improving of the public build
ing at Columbia, Missouri. Be it
enacted by the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States
of America In Congress assembled,
that there is hereby appropriated, out
of any funds in the Treasury not oth
erwise appropriated, the sum of $G0,
000, or so much thereof as may be nec
essary, for the purpose of creating an
addition to the public building at Co
lumbia, in the State of Missouri, and
for the extending, remodeling and im
proving said public building, to be
expended under the direction of the
Secretary of the Treasury."
HUGO-HE CUTS HIS OWN HAIR
Rocheport's Only Barber Doesn't Care
to Chance Columbia.
Hugo Dietrich of Rocheport cuts his
own hair, according to the St. Louis
Republic. He has the only barber
shop in Rocheport, and he is the only
barber in the only barber shop. The
nearest barber chair is in Columbia,
fourteen miles away.
Rut Hugo hasn't time to go to Co
lumbia. Besides, rumor has it, Hugo
basing his opinion on some of the hair
cuts worn by the University students,
doesn't think much of the skill of Co
lumbia barbers. He doesn't want his
hair long on the top of his skull, while
his head is shaved in the rear. Yet
that is what the students demand, he
says.
Inverted soup bowls have long been
out of fashion for hair cuts In Roche
port, so Hugo has invented a much
better method. He stands between
two mirrors and clips and snipes
away until his head is properly shorn.

THREE TEAMS TIED IN VALLEY
However, Basketball Race Will Nar
row Down This Week.
Three teams Missouri, Nebraska
and the Kansas Aggies have percent
ages of 1,000 In the Missouri Valley
Conference basketball race. Nebraska,
however, has more victories than
either the Tigers or the Aggies. The
Cornhuskers have won six games,
while Missouri and the Farmers each
have won four. None of the three
has lost a game.
Washington is occupying a safe
place in the cellar, having lost every
conference game played this season.
The Pikers were defeated by Kansas
last week by practically the same
score by which the Tigers downed the
St. Louis team. This would seem, to
indicate that the Jayhawks and Van
Gent's quintet are about evenly
matched. This will be determined
when the two teams meet here Wed
nesday and Thursday nights.
Until Missouri, beats Kansas and
the Kansas Aggies, the rooters can
not lay any claim to the championship,
says C. L. Brewer, for to date the
Tigers have defeated only tail-enders.
The three-cornered fight for the
title will be narrowed down to two
teams next Friday and Saturday
nights, when the Cornhuskers and
the Kansas Aggies get together at
Lincoln. Kansas and Washington will
meet at St. Louis the same nights.
The standing is as follows:
TEAlt WON LOST
Nebraska C 0 1,000
Missouri 4 0 1,000
Kansas Aggies 4 0 1,000
Kansas 3 S .370
Ames 1 5 .1GG
Drake O 2 .000
Washington 0 C .000

BARBER LA YS
TO BEGIN
To the patron who was the last to
climb into the barber chair of Victor
B. Jones at the Tiger Barber Shop
Saturday night there was, perhaps,
nothing unusual in his call of "next"
or in the shave and haircut which fol
lowed. But to Jones, the barber, that
last "job" marked a turning point In
his life. When the patron was shaved
and tonicked and powdered Jones
folded his towels, arranged tho tonic
bottles on the shelf before him, gave
his razor a few supplementary turns
upon the strop and then slipped his
white starched coat from his shoul
ders and laid it away for the last time.
For Saturday night Jones ceased to
bo a barber. This morning, instead
of going to the shop, he took the
elevator to the fourth floor of the
Guitar building. He turned in at
the office of Victor II. Jones, attorney-at-law,
erstwhile barber at the Tiger
Shop.
To the world this change from bar
ber to lawyer is a matter of but
twenty-four hours. To Jones it is the
reward of years of study, of burning
of the midnight oil. It is the realiza
tion of a worthy ambition attained by
sacrifices which many youths in Co
lumbia who seek the wisdom of Black-
stone under learned professors cannot
appreciate.
For with the exception of one Sum
mer Session, in 1905, Jones has nev
er attended the University. He fin
ished his elementary education in the
Columbia schools and has since work
ed at his trade. He is 29 years old and
married.
Three and one-half years ago Jones
began his actual preparation for the
state bar examinations. He passed
them recently in competition with 100

unaccustomed roles for the benefit of
charity.
