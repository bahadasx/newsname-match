I TO BE HALTED
United States Not to Allow
Mere Choice of Words
to Stand in Way.
SETTLEMENT CERTAIN
President and Lansing to
Wind Up Negotiations
Without Delay.
Washington, D. C, Feb. 7. Secre
tary Lansing today flatly denied that
new demands had been made in the
Lusitania case at a time when the
German government considered the
negotiations practically were at an
end. He was speaking of the Berlin
dispatches quoting the references by
Dr. Zimmermann, German under-sec-reiary
of foreign affairs, to "new de
mands." "This government," said Secretary
Lansing, "has not increased the de
mands made in the Lusitania case as
set forth in the notes of May 13, June
9 and July 21. I doubt if Dr. Zim
mermann ever made the statement
that new demands had been injected,
because he must know that it is ut
terly false."
o New Demands.
Secretary Lansing would not go in
to d tails or discuss Dr. Zimnier
mann's statement further. "When Dr.
Zimmermann's statement was pub
lished in this country, however, his
reference to new demands was taken
to apply to a possible continuation on
tbe.word "illegal" in the., proposed
form or settlement. The only ground
American officials could find for con
struing that as embodying a new de
mand, was tin? possibility that it might
be considered applicable not alone to
the destruction of neutrals on the
Lusitania, but also as to the method by
which she was sunk. .
Secretary L .nsing said he expected
to confer with President Wilson to
day. He made it known, however, that
the state department considered the
situation unchanged.
Chairman Stone of the senate for
eign relations committee said after
talking with admu:iytration officials
that li.s impressio.i was the Lusitania
case was "practically settled." He did
not go into details. Secretary Lan
sing, however, indicated that some an
nouncement might be given out within
the next few days.
There was no indication whether
the president had definitely decided
whether Germany's latest proposal
was satisfactory or unsatisfactory.
"Words" Sot to Block Way.
Administration officials let it be
known that a mere choice of words
would not be permitted to stand in
the way of success of the negotia
tions, and that the United States will
not insist on the use of the word "il
lega or "disavowal" in Germany's
acknowledgment that sinking of the
liner without warning and the loss of
115 American lives was wrong.
Inasmuch as the proposal now be
fore President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing is described in German head
Quarters as substituting for the word
"illegal" a phrase which Germany
hopes will be acceptable to the United
States as covering the same point
without humiliating Germany, and
having regard for public opinion in
that country, this announcement was
taken as strengthening the optimistic
atmosphere which surrounds the nego
tiations, and possibly leaving open the
ay to continued negotiations. The
Principal consideration of the United
States now is that there shall be an
acknowledgment by Germany that the
inking of an unresisting merchant
man without warning is in contraven
tion of international law and that such
aovel warfare shall be permanently

ARMY OF RELIEF
IS STILL HOPEFUL
FOR POLAND AID
Chicago, 111., Feb. 7. "We are not
surprised at the statement of Sir Ed
ward Gray, England's secretary of
foreign affairs," thafHTs't5Dantry "can
not permit shipment of food to Poland
under present conditions," said John
F. Smulski of Chicago in a statement
today. Mr. Smulski, who has repre
sented American Polish organizations
in negotiations regarding relief for
Poland, expressed the belief, however,
that international conditions would
shape themselves as to make possible
the sending of foodstuffs to the people
of that war stricken country.
"England asks what is right and
fair she should ask of us. Germany is
willing to make every necessary con
cession consistent with charity and
humanity," continued Mr. Smulski. "In
the i'ace of existing military conditions
we have no right to view too critically
the attitude of either side. We must
wait until we have exhausted our ef
forts and receive an ultimate refusal.
"As I read Sir Edwarl Grey's letter
to Herbert C. Hoover, chariman of the
American Commission for the relief
of Belgium, made public yesterday,
England demands three things of Ger
many: Prohibition of the export of
foodstuffs from Russian Poland; guar
antee that the native stock of foodstuffs
shall not be drawn on to
maintain the occupying armies and as
surance that the relief committee will
be given a free hand in the distribu
tion of food.
"As to the first demand, I believe
Germany will agree t,o prohibit furth
er exportation of foodstuffs from Rus
sian Poland.
"As to the second, I believe that
there are no native stocks of food,
and hence they could not be drawn on
by the occupying armies.
"As to the third demand, we will
give every assurance that the relief
committee will be given a free hand
and that Imported food for relief will
be distributed only among the suffer
ing civilian population."

FACES NEW TRIAL
Providence, R. I., Feb. 7. Mrs. Eliz
abeth F. Mohr Sunday was acquitted
of the charge of having instigated the
murder of her husband, Dr. C. Frank
lin Mohr. C. Victor Brown and Henry
H. Spellman, negroes, accused of the
actual killing were found guilty. The
penalty was fixed at life Imprison
ment The jury reported at 6:07 o'clock
Sunday morning. Mrs. Mohr swooned
while the foreman was announcing the
verdict
"Is there any other charge against
these defendants?" inquired Justice
Sterns. "There is, your honor," Attor
ney General Rice replied, "but Mrs.
Mohr is on bail on the other charge."
"The defendants Brown and Spellman
are committed without bail," said the
court, "and Mrs. Mohr is discharged
from custody on this complaint."
The other charge against Mrs. Mohr
and the two negroes is that they com
mitted an assault on Miss Emily Bur
ger, with Intent to kill.
Paris Buries
Its Victims
of Zepplins
Paris, Feb. 7 (12, noon.) The fu
neral of 12 victims of the recent Zep
pelin raid on Paris, held in the church
of Notre Dame de La Croix, at Menil
montant, today, bnught out an im
mense throng.
The chief discourse was pronounced
by Adrien Mithourd, president of the
municipal council, in the name of the
city of Paris, at whose expense the
obsequies were held.
"In deciding to bury these innocent
victims," said M. Mituourd, "Pari3
wished to preserve from oblivion the
memory of an inexpiable crime. She
wished to raise a monument that will
recall to the generations to come that
France has for a neighbor a nation
unworthy of the great ambitions she
pursues, inhuman to the point of do
ins evil for pleasure, the only coun
try in the world and in history that
has consecrated in its language a mon
strous word to express the joy ot do
ing harm."

OPEN HEARING IN
BIG MURDER CASE
AGAINST WOMAN
Winterset, Iowa, Feb. 7. The case
of Ida M. Meyer, 60 years of age, and
reputed wealthy,, charged with com
plicity in the" murder of her son s
I wife, was expected to go to trial here
jlate today in District Judge Apple
I gate's court
Because of Mrs. Meyer's advanced
;agevher reputed wealth and the stand
iing of the family in this community,
the case has attracted widespread in
; terest and preparations have been
made for large crowds at the trial.
I The wife of Fred Meyer, the de
fendant's son, was a bride of only a
' few months when she was found dying
in her home, northwest of here, on the
j morning of July 25, 1915. A bullet
i wound was in her head and a revolver
! was found by her side. Meyer and his
mother claimed the young woman com
mitted suicide.
Fred Meyer was convicted of second
I degree murder in December, was sen
tenced to 15 years in the penitentiary,
I but is now at liberty on bond of $20,000
! pending an appeal to the supreme
1 court. His mother, last Saturday was
! refused a change of venue. Her at
! torneys charged that feeling is running
jhigh against her in Madison county
and that she could not receive an im
partial trial here.
A special venire of 40 men has been
called for Mrs. Meyer's trial. It is ex
pected that some difficulty will be en
countered in obtaining a jury. Attor
neys for the state and defense were
agreed today that approximately 100
witnesses will be called. Much of the
testimony is expected to be similar to
that given at the son's trial.
HOUSE PERTURBS
PARIS PAPER MAN
Paris, Feb. 7. George Clemenceau,
formerly French premier, commenting
in his newspaper, L' Homme Enchiane,
on Colonel House's mission, which he
says, "seems to me characteristic of
Presidert Wilson's spirit of hesita
tion," writes: "Europe has suddenly
seen a dumb missionary disembark on
its shores for a tour of inspection
among the combatants. He has passed
everywhere, appearing and disappear
ing, but turns like the flying Dutch
man in the mists of the horizon. He has
said nothing, his whole mission evi
dently being to observe. His task, I
suppose, is to report faithfully to the
president-candidate the conclusions he
draws from personal observations as to
the balance of the force between the
belligerents.
"I know nothing about Colonel
House," concludes M. Clemenceau,
"but the fact that he has been chosen
for this investigation by the first mag
istrate of the American republic leads
me to infer that he has at least the
qualities of observation and good sense.
This is enough to satisfy me of the re
sults of his investigation."
Opera Singer Over Crisis.
New York, Feb. 7. Antonio Scottt,
the opera singer, who has been criti
cally ill with pneumonia at his hotel

"Washington, Feb. 7. Placing of ex
tra police guards on the Brooklyn and
Manhattan bridge yesterday when the
cruiser Washington passed under them
was explained by Secretary Daniels
today as a precautionary measure,
taken because of the receipt of two
letters calling the navy department's
attention to the fact that it would be
easy to destroy warships passing un
der the bridges by dropping bombs on
them.
The secretary said there was no in
timation that any plot existed for the
destruction of the Washington or any
other vessel. He declined to make
public the names of the men who
wrote the letters.
Deny Ship Sunk.
London, Feb. 7, (3:20 p. m.) The
following official statement was issued
here today:
"A German wireless message today
quotes Koelnischne Zeitung reports
from the Dutch frontier that on the oc
casion of the recent air raid on Eng
land H. M. S. Caroline was struck by
a bomb in the Humber and sunk with
great loss of life.
"Neither the Caroline nor any other
of his majesty's ships nor any mer
chant ships, large or small, was
struck by a bomb in the Humber nor
in any other port."
The Caroline is a light cruiser, dis
placing about 3,800 tons, which, ac
cording to the latest naval records,
was built at Birkenhead in 1914. Her
armament is given as two six-inch
guns, two our-inch guns and four tor

THE WAR TODAY
IIcaTy guns of lhe opposing ar
mies are striving tor dominance
in important sectors of the Franco-Belgian
front, Berlin today re
ports artillery battles, which it
characterizes as "fierce" between
La Bassee canal and Arras, and
south of the river Somme and like
wise a virorous bombardment of
Lens by allied artillery.
The first mentioned sector,
which includes Lens, was the
scene of the notable advance by
the British and French last Sep
tember. The region south of the
Somme came Into prominence not
long since with a sudden thrust
by the Teutons, who claimed tak
ing 3,500 yards of trenches.
Intensive artillery fire in these
sectors may presage an attempt
by the allies to regain lost ground
or a general effort to make gen
eral advances.
Paris, neither in Its statement
of today, nor that of last night,
mentioned the artillery engage
ment which the German commun
ication records. The Berlin bulle
tin declares in addition that the '
French were driven out of a
crater they orupied after a mine
explosion on Hill 285 in the Ar
gonne. While reports of the actual op.
ening of an offensive movement by
Teutonic allies against Saloniki
appear to have been premature,
the cables continue to bring ac
counts of troop movements to in
dicate that such an offensive is
probably not far distant. Athens
dispatches today tell of continued
concentration of German, Austrian
and Bulgarian forces on the Greek
frontier, together with the transfer
of heavy artillery southward from
Msh.
With such a movement in the
Balkans in prospect, the reports
that come from Rumania command
increasing Interest. Advices from
allied sources declare that the fric
tion between Rumania and the cen
tral powers has Increased and that
Rumania, supposedly In view of
the reported threatening attitude
of Germany and Austria, has col
lected forces close to the Austro
Hungarian frontier.

MINERSTHREATEN
GENERAL STRIKE
New York, Feb. 7. Labor leaders
here say that a movement is under
way to bring about concerted action
of members of the four great unions
of railway employes and of the Unit
