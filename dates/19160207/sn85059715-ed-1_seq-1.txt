Offensive Movement against
the City of Soloniki Seems
Not to Have Begun.
TEUTONS ARE MASSING
An Important Offensive by Germans
is Expected to Begin
in the West Soon.
While recent reports of the actual
opening of an offensive movement by
Ithe Teutonic Allies against Salonlki
appear to have been premature, the
cables continue to bring accounts of
various iroop movements held In military
quarters to Indicate that such
an offensive Is probably sot far distant.
Athens despatches today tell
of continued concentration of German,
Austrian and Bulgarian forces
on the Greek frontier, together with
the transfer of heavy artillery southward
from Nislt.
With such a movement In the Balkans
in prospect, the reports that
come out of Rouiuania command increasing
Interest. Auvices from Allied
sources declare that the friction
between llou mania and the
Central Powers has Increased and
that Rouinania, supposedly in view
of the reported threatening attitude
of Germany and Austria, 1ms collected
forces close to the Austrian frontier.
There Is a paucity of news of active
operations in any of the war
lields, probably for the good reason
that few important movements-are
now actually in progress. The chief
capitals of the Entente Allies, however,
appear to be impressed with
the Idea that an important offensive
is shortly to be begun by the Germans
in the West. The belief is
prompted by the military movements
i noted in recent days, considered to
presage something out of the ordinary.
The latest official bulletin from
' Constantinople reports improved conditions
for the Turks, who apparently
have recently been under extrenieI
^ ly severe pressure by the Russians.
Ia Although the Ottoman forces aumimd
Erzerum seemingly have not been
successful in undertaking an offensive
they have been able to repulse
?ij cue renewed tuissian attacKs,
they declare.
No change in the situation iu Mesopotamia
Is Indicated, the British relief
army still being stalled on the
Tigris some distance down the river
from Kut-el-Amara, it appears.
GERMANS CONCENTRATE
ON GREEK FRONTIERS
(IV ASSOCIATED PASSS)
MILAN, Italy, Ken '.?A 0fSf
10111 Athens says that French aviators
report continued concentration
of adversary forces on the Greek
frontiers. German re-enforcomenta
1 are advancing from Uskup to the
northwest of Glegell, fresh German
regiments having arrived at Monastir
and Austrian forces are concentrating
around Tchcklvoko, a Bulgarian
frontier is confirmed.
KITCHENER TO LEAVE
BRITISH OFFICE OF WAR
IDT ASSOCIATED PHISSl
LONDON, Feb. 7.?Changes of great
importance in the direction of the war
are contemplated, says the Daily
Sketch, it asserts Earl Kitchener
f probably will leave the war office.

In event that Earl Kitchener leaves
