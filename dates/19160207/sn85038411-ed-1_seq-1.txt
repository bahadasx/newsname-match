COMBINED ACTION
Labor Leaders Say Move Is
Under Way to Bring Increas
ed Wage Demands Jointly
750,000 MEN ARE AFFECTED
Trainmen, Engincmen and
Firemen Heads Approve
of Move
By Associated Press
New York, Feb. 7.—Labor leaders 1
here say that a movement is under
way to bring about concerted action
of members of the four great unions of |
railway employes and of the union of
mine workers in their demands for
increased wages or shorter working
days. It is stated that if this plan j
were put Into effect it would bring
about combined action by 750,000 men ;
and affect the mining fields of Penn
sylvania, Colorado and the South.
The movement is said to have the
approval of W S. Carter, president of
Hie Brotherhood of locomotive Fire
men and Enginemen, and of W. G.
l-.ee, president of the Brotherhood of
Railroad Trainmen. Representatives
of the railroad unions are said to have
been sent lo Mobile to confer with the
United Mine Workers of America, who
are gathering there for a conference
with the operators to-morrow.
lr is reported here that John P.
White, president of the United Mine
Workers, has disapproved the pro
posed coalition.
Members of the local brotherhoods
learned of this proposition to-day. Any
action that will be taken will be a
part of the meetings next Sunday.
Trainmen were of the opinion that if
President William G, Dee authorized
a vote on this question, it would come.
They would not commit themselves as
to what the probable result would be.
Members of the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen
were not inclined to talk on the sub
ject until the question reached the
local lodges from headquarters.
Partial Victory Now
Predicted by Miners
Special to the Telegraph
lla'/.leton. Pa.. Feb. 7. —"There will
be no strike in the anthracite coal
Held.
"The miners will be granted a wage
Increase, but it may not be 20 per cent.
"On the other demands of the men,
compromises will be reached after ex- j
1 ended negotiations in New York be
iween committees of the union and tlio
operators.
"The chances are that the price of
fuel will be advanced after April 1.
"Each side will fight hard for .its
contention, and at times the outlook
may be critical, but there won't be any
break."
These arc the deductions reached by
an expert in the Lehigh field after the
people have had a chance lo recover
from the shock they got when it was !
announced from New York last week
that all the- demands of miners had
been rejected, when, in fact, they had
merely issued the first of a series of
statements to the public explaining
their position.

District Attorney Gets Bloody
Story From Trembling
Witness
FEARED SAME FATE
Nikolo Kotur Swore He' Would
Finish Man Who Told
of Crime
When Mike Novokovic climbed
tremblingly* to bed that memorable
December night Joso Backie was
murdered in Steelton's foreign colony,
' this was the last thing he saw from
I the top of the stairway,
j At the bottom of the flight lay the
' quivering figure of Backie. Over him,
drawn knife in hand, stood Nikolo
Kotur. As the fascinated witness
i watched, Backic feebly tried to raise
his arm. Kotur deliberately stepped
upon the fallen head and ground his
boot-heel into the upturned face.
That was only part of the confession
Novokovic this morning reluctantly
made to County Detectives James T.
Walters in the Dauphin county prison.
It was just what District Attorney
Michael E. Stroup wanted to untangle
a few threads of evidence with which
lie hopes on Wednesday to send Kotur
to the electric chair.
.\l tlie Foot of the Stairs
Novokovic added some other start
ling details of that winter night, which
has materially strengthened the
State's case.
As Novokov'c crawled into bed his
room-niate noticed that he was shak
ing as if with a fever; Novokovic
didn't even undress but quickly buried
his face in the covers. Mike admit
ted this in bis confession to-day.
