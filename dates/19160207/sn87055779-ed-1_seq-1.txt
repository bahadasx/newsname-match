International News Service:
LNIoN. Feb. 7. Growing in
timacy between Koumania and the
allies is causing Germany and Aus
tria much alarm.
A circular note, signed by both
T'.erlin and Vienna governments, has
been sent to Bucharest protesting
against the sale of grain to F.ngland.
This grain, it is understood, is to bo
turned over to the allies in consid
eration for a national loan.
Germany is said to be seeking to
have Koumania give guarantees for
continued neutrality and at the same
time demobilize the frontier guards
on the Unitarian and Hungarian
boundaries.
Chief interest in the Balkan situa
tion is now centered upon Koumania
and it is believed that definite action
will be taken by King Ferdinand's
government within the next few
w neks.
The central powers have mansed
heavy forces of men and a great
amoi'pt of artillery on the Kou
manian border and I'.uUaria has also
held a b!g army upon the Rouman
ian frontier. At Rustchuk, the chief
Bulgarian city on the Roumanian
border, there is a large force of Ger
mans and Austnans supporting the
Bulgarians.

Commissioners Meet But Find
No Bids on Haven Hubbard
Concrete Road.
Not even the juicy offer of a con
tract to pave a road for $30,000;
j coubi tempt the 20 contractors and j
; builders who appeared before the
j county commissioners Monday morn- j
lug. Bids on the Haven Hubbard i
road, which runs north from New !
Carlisle and thence through Hamil
ton which is to he paved with con
crete, were to be received by tho
commissioner?!. None. however,
was forthcoming:.
The reason given for the reticence
of the contractors In filing bids was
th.it the. price of cement has Jumped.
It sold formerly last fall and as
la e as December for $1.08 a barrel,
but now It Is $1.56 and even higher.
When the specifications for the
road were made out, calling for a
concrete pavement 14 feet wide, the
basis of computation was made on
the old price of concrete.
Monday morning contractors from
far and near were present at tho
meeting but minus bids. The hour
of eleven approached. th time limit
for receiving them, and not a sign
of an offer was in sight. Shortly af
ter the hour, members of a contract
ing firm from Ohio put In an appear
ance. They had a bid tucked under
their arm and at the price limit al
lowed in tho speciilcations.
It was too late. The commission
ers decided to readvertise for bids
in tho hope that the Ohio firm or
pome other contractors would decide
to accept the offer. In the meantime
the Haven Hubbard people must
wait for the filing of the bids, or
change the specifications calling for
concrete pavement to brick or some
cheaper substances.

PIELAGES MINE IS
ROBBED OF PROVISIONS
Tells Workers That They Will

First Train in Eight

luteruutional News Sendee:
Kb PASO. Texas, Feb. 7. Fran
cisco Villa has declared war to the
death against all Americans in Mex
ico. He has vowed to kill all cit
izens of the United States who fall
Into hie hands This threat was
made by the rebel leader to a group
of Mexican miners at Pielages, Chi
huahua, last week:
"I will kill every American I lay
my hands on."
News of Villa's declaration of
hostility was taken to Chihuahua
City on Friday by Mexicans who
walked 40 miles to warn the Amer
ican colony in that tow n was brought
here early today by passengers on
the first train from the interior of
Mexico that has reached the border
In eight days.
To Let Gerninns Alone.
These passengers also brought a
report that has reached Chihuahua
City that German agents are back
ing Villa in his warfare against the
Carranza government. They said
that all the scattered Villa bands
in Chihuahua state have been in
stricted to "let the Germans alone,
because they are our friends."
The Pielage3 mine, which lies 21
mile? west of the point where Villa
soldi ;rs held up a passenger train
last Monday and murdered Gen.
Tomas Orenelas because he had de
serted Villa for Carranza, was rob
bed of $7,000 worth of provisions
when Villa and his raiders arrived
there on Wednesday. The mine is
owned by an American named Fin-'j
nev ana a. li. Davison, a nritisn
I subject. Davison was a passenger
on the train that reached here today.
Davison told the following story
Of the looting of the mine 'stores as
related to him by Juan Iorrazota,
one of the 'Mexican employes:
"Villa came to Pielages after he
had held up a passenger train at
Laffuna. . With the rebel leader were
about 200 well-armed men. They
were mounted on the finest horses I
have ever seen and were well pro
vided w4th ammunition.
"Afier robu'ng us the band re
tired to the canyon of El Nido, five
miles to tho west, but later they came
back and warned us that we must
quit working the mine and abandon
the camp.
Would Kill Them.
"Villa said that he would not per
mit any mines owned by Americans
to be worked. He said that if we
came back he would kill us all.
"Then he said that he would kill
every American he got his
hands on. and it was lucky for Mr.
Finney he was not there. One of
the miners said he saw a German
among Villa's soldiers."
The employes of the PilaP'es
mine obeyed Villa's orders and
abandoned the camp. St) me of those
who nought safety at Chihuahua
City were without food for 36 hours.
Other passengers on the train said j
that Chihuahua 'ity is insecure. ;
that there are only ."() Carranza '
soldiers there and that Villa raiders;
have been looting within three miles
of the town. There is considerable '

The Arkansas river has formed a
giant lake, with the east wall of the
Mississippi river forming one of its
banks. For a distance of 4 0 miles
the lake was 30 miles wide today. All
of Arkansas City except the upper
stories of buildings was under water.
Only a few residents of the city re
mained in their homes, marooned in
the second stories, and thrc steam

threaten to wash away the houses.
