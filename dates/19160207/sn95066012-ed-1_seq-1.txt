lo t!ie jaoilern eity dweller its is
ed'.Rtiilou, mrui-iliug to J. IX. IJkhiinls,
the Cbk-ago suiei'iuteiideut of recrea
tion. In u paper -n the subject, pre
pared for the current issue of the
American City, Mr. Klcunrds urges
that It Is as much a iluty of the gov-
enimtiit to provide facilities for both
ehililren siml nrtults to play in nnd
about cities as to provide adequate edu
cational facilities.
Anierlcvin cities liave approached the
tday problem In ti)o hapiiar-.ard a fash
ion. Mr. Iilcliards ilcvlnres. Most of
the legislation on the subject, he snyjs,
h.'is bci-n passed wiilioiit adeiuate
study of the real needs of the public
and from a restrictive rather than a
coDslttK tive point o iew. The public
aern'ies f;i cliargo recreation work
have rl;ed indcpeiuleDtly -md with
i)i common g'.ijil, ,
' l'er children Mr. llii h-.irds suggests
t.iiut the city should lie districted and
that the city government should pro
vide a phiy lender for each district
The duty of tho day leader would be
to help1 all children vvhj .play in the
street, to direct their piny iu the most
licneflt'iiil channels and to guide them
when there Is opportunity .to the near
est public recreation centers. He
points out that even where there are
recreation centers children may be
found playing in the streets near by,
particularly nt hours v.-heu their par
ents have warned them not to net be
yond "calling distance" from their
homes. It is for Ihis reason that the
street lender is needed.
In speaking of the need of play for
ndults, the writer quotes Spencer In
saying: "We stop playing not. because
we grow old. AVe grow old because wo
stop playing."
FORTNIGHTLY MUSICALE
Largest Audience of Season Enjoyed
the Program.
The annual niUBlcale of the Fort

of the season to the . Congregational

man, and was given by the Cadinan
Concert company of Boston which in

Miss May Powers, pianist; Miss Syl
via Fish, vioHnlst, and Henry Flagg,
'cellist. i ' ,
Their ensemble work was particu
larly pleasing and In solo numbers
they fully sustained the advance
notices that they were artists of well
established reputation. Miss Denny's
rich contralto yoico was heard to good
advantage in her arias and her songs
showed that she had versatility as
well as temperament: Miss Fish
played with the power and musict-
anliness of one who is truly In touch
with tho liossibilities of her instru
ment, and the fiiio support of Mlsa
Powers' accompaniments- helped to
.make every nuriaber pleasing. The
complete program was as follows:

Washington Feb. 6. Berlin's latest
memorandum on tho Lusitania ' con
troversy can be made the basis of an
amicable settlement, according- to in
formation which came tonight from
a high Administration source.
Whether he final agreement - will
take the exact form of the Berlin mora
orandum remains to be determined t
the conference which the President
and Secretary Lansing are expected
to hold tomorrow. At all events, th
communication which Ambassador
von Bernstorff handed to the Secre
tary last Friday has improved th out
look. . , :
This information coming from aa
unquestionable source, confirms an im
pression, which has steadily grown In
the last twenty-four hours, that, tat
danger of a rupture in the relations
between the two government has
been removed for the present.
The only point now ai issue reet

not have been made, -;; .. ,' '
The two positiensit Is stated, indi-V
cate merely the distinction between '
what.was "illegal" and what was un
justifiable;". -between the'Amortcaa
contention that the act of 'Tetaliai
tion against Great Britain was wrotifc
and the German point of view that it
was only wrong because it resulted in
tho killing of neutrals. -
Count von Bernstorff, according to
his friends, is more than ever confufc
ent that Germany's proposals will be
accepted by the United States.' It is
Insulting Local Optionists.
If Rev. Clarence True Wilson is
cqirectly reported, his remarks in
Barre regarding local optionists who
may elect to vote against the Perry
referendum are little Icbs than insult'
ing. not to say sacrilegious.
The Herald's correspondent give
tho following version of his reference
to good people who may desire to vote
f or local option :
"Any man who votes to keep
saloons in any one of Vermont's 17
wet towns," he said,' "offers an Insult
to Almighty God every lime he prays
When the roll Is . called up yonder
he'll be there" (pointing downward).
Disregarding the exceedingly bad
taste which dictated such a remark
on a platform, from which a brother
minister of the gospel, a true local
optionist from conviction, had just of
fered prayer, is it not time for the ad
vocates of Perryism to realize that
the advocates of local option are not
necessarily "rummies," "whiskeyites"
or fiends in human form simply be
cause they regard the' present law as
a temperance measure?
The discussion of a mere legisla
tive measuro, now before the people
for adoption or rejection, does not
ustify language such ns that attriou-
ted to the paid upllfter who is repre
senting the cause of prohibition ami
misropreseniing tho character of loco!
optionists throughout Vermont.
When good people differ from us, they
are not necessarily depraved charact
ers. They may actually be temper
ance men.
It would seem to The Herald ex
tremely unfortunate that the Anti
Saloon league and others who are In
terested in the repeal of the present
law should have elected to bring into
the state men who, by virtue of their
lifelong training and prejudicial esti
mate of all opponents, are led into
such intemperance of statement as
the foregoing. Rutland Herald.
