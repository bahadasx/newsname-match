LONDON, Feb. 7. In connection with reports of the contempla-
ted offensive by the Teutons against Saloniki, an Athens dispatch
tells of continued concentration of Germans, Austrian and Bulbar-
ians on the Greek frontier. It also refers to the transfer of heavy
artillery southward from Nish. Advices from allied sources assert
that friction between Rumania and the central powers has increased
and that Rumania, supposedly In view of the reported threatening
attitude of Germany and Austria, has collected forces close to the
Austro-Hungarian frontier.

JUDGE M. R. AVERILL
INTERESTING SERVICES LAST
EVENING AT THE PRESBY
TERIAN CHURCH
There was a full attendance at the
Sunday school yesterday. There was
a good congregation to hear the third
sermon of the series now being de
livered on the Shepherd Psalm. The
text was, "He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness, for His name's sake."
The principal thought was that God
will lead us in right paths if we will
only permit Him to do so.
About three dozen were in atten
dance at the Christian Endeavor ser
vice which was led by Mr. Ellis. This
society is evidently in a prosperous
condition.
All the' seating capacity of the
church was needed to accommodate
the audience at the evening service.
Professor Dllworth could not be pre
sent on account of an attack of the
grippe. Judge Averill gave a most In
teresting and Instructive talk on the
subject of vocation.
He started with the statement that
, ,,, , . . ,!
success in life Is very easy to attain,
that it must be built upon certain well
known princples, first among which is
good habits, then Industry, strict hon
esty and an adequate preparation. This
latter in its application to young peo
ple refers especially to education.
Last of all he said an essential to
success is good nature. The talk was
interspersed with Stories illustrating
the various qualities referred to.

The temperature today is higher
than it has been at any time since
the beginning of the long continued

burrowing into the earth below the
ice, forming narrow, but deep flsBureB.

passes, that the streets will be left
