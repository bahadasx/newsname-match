"There are too many 'lowbrows'

Chairman Stone of the senate for

pression that the f.iisttanfa ease
was 'practically settled." He did
not go into details.
Washington, Feb. 7. Secretary Lan
sing today denied that new demands
had been made in the Lusitania case
at a time when the German govern
ment considered the negotiations prac
tically were at end. He was speaking
of the Berlin dispatches quoting the
references by Dr. Zimmermann, Ger
man under secretary of foreign af
fairs, on new demands.
He said he doubted if Dr. Zimmer
mann ever made the statement that
new demands had been injected, "be
cause he must know that it is utterly
false."
W iiafL Wore "Demamlb?"
Secretary Lansing would not go into
details or discuss Dr. Zimmerman's
statement further. When Dr. Zim
merman's statement was published in
this country, however, his reference to
new demands was taken to apply to a
possible construction on the word
'illegal in the proposed form of
settlement. The only ground Ameri
can officials could find for construing
that as embodying a new demand was
the possibility that it might be con
sidered applicable not alone to the de
struction of neutrals on the Lusitania,
but also as to the method by which
she was sunk. Secretary Lansing re
peated he expected to confer with
President Wilson today. He made it
known the state department consid
ered the situation unchanged.

HEPBURN IS DEAD
Ircnrincnt lowan rved 20 Years in
Congress Author of Famous
Hepburn Law.
Clarinda, Iowa, Feb. 7. Col. Wil
liam P. Hepburn, former member of
congress from this district, died here
today after a long illnes?.
Death resulted from kidney rnd
heart trouble.' Mr.- Hepburn was near
death last November, but after a time
rallied and a few weeks ago was so
much improved that he thought seri
ously of returning to Washington to
look after an extensive law practice
which he acquired after leaving con
gress. About a week ago his condi- I
tion took a turn for the worse and
since that time he lost ground steadily.
Prominent Koosevelt Man.
Col. William P. Hepburn, although
twenty years in congress, became best i
known throughout the contry during
the Roosevelt administration. It was
he who framed what later was called
the Hepburn law, probititing rebates
and discrimination by railroads. As
chairman of the house committee on
interstate and foreign commerce in the
first est?ion of the Fifty-ninth con
gress he was the author of three acts
out of five, which the then President
Roosevelt afterward declared would
cause that congress to be memorable
in history because of its constructive
legislatfon. Of the five acts, four came
from Colonel Hepburn's committee
and three of them the Hepburn law,
the pure food act and the public
health act were framed by Colonel
Hepburn himself.
Mr. Hepburn also was an efficient
holdier and a lawyer of high reputa
tion. He was a product of the early
pioneer days in Iowa and got what lit
tle schooling he had in three winters
at an academy near Iowa City. He
was born in Columbiana county, Ohio,
November 4, 1833, removing to Iowa
City where his mother and his step
father took up their residence on a
farm when he was 8 years old.
HOLDS IMMORAL HOUSE
NOT PUBLIC NUISANCE
In J unct Ion , Wca pon of Kansas City
Ant i-Vice Crusaders, Held!
Void by Court.
Kansas City, Feb. 7. The injunc
tion, the weapon the Society for the
Suppression of Commercialized Vice
has used in its fight against immor
ality in Kansas City, was dealt a blow
by a decision of the Kansas City court
of appeals today. The court held an
immoral house was not a public nui
sance and an injunction could not be
issued against one, because a court of
equity had no jurisdiction in such a
case. In its opinion, the court main
tained r resort was a crime and
should b proceeded against in th-e
criminal court.
In the tight waged against vice in
Kansas City during the last two years
the injunction has been used to close
many placee and to its effectiveness
has been attributed the successful
fight made to abrlish segregated dis
tricts in this city.

That Washburn college students
spend a quarter of a million dollars a
year In Topeka, and that the institu
tion is the most valuable asset Topeka
has, next to the Santa Fe, were the
assertions made this morning by "W.
W. Webb, president of the Commer
cial club, at the celebration of the
fifty-first anniversary of the founding
of the college in Mac Vicar chapel be
fore a large; assemblage of students,
alumni, faculty members and trus
tees who spent the entire day today
celebrating the birthday of the famous
school.
At 1 0 o'clock this morning, all
classes were dismissed so that the oc
casion could be fittingly observed by
all who are connected with the insti
tution, and the first of a full day's
program was held in cnapel when six
prominent speakers devoted an hour
and a half to talks on "The Best
Things T Can Say About Washburn."
D?an McKaohron presided over the
meeting, and the college glee club fur
nished the musical end of the pro
gram. Washburn's Inheritances.
Prof. S. U. Hefelbower's talk
seemed to produce the greatest effect
upon his hearers. "The greatest
things Wathburn possesses," the pro
fessor said, "are her inheritances and
her precious opportunities." Among
the inheritances, he mentioned the
fine campus and buildings, the strong
ideals that have been handed down
since the founding of the school, and
the far famed "spirit of Washburn."
Professor Hefelbower also struck a
popular chord -when- he made the as
sertion that Washburn is never to be
come a thing of the past, but is to be
oarre&-an to greater and robkr things
by the indomitable enthusiasm that
has already given the institution a
high rank among the leading educa
tional institutions of the country.
Ur.
m. Sheldon, another of the
speakers, compared Washburn to the :
ideal institution that brings to the
students a knowledge of the world's !
things and teaches them to take this;
it to good account.

Before adjournment, Edwin Men
ninger of the senior class proposed
that those present at the meeting send
a message of encouragement to Presi
dent Womer, who in in the east work
ing on the endowment campaign, and
a committee was appointed to do this.
Following the chapel meeting, the
second feature of the day's program,
the annual faculty-trustees luncheon
i was sprved in Boswell hall, and at 2 30
i o'clock the trustees convened in their
regular semi-annual meeting.
! The trustees' meeting consumed

routine business was taken up. The

matters relating to gifts that have been
