the war game ended with the landing of
the hostile army on the shores of the
Culled States. ,
When the smoke or the disastrous
mimic naval battle cleared away Ad-
mlrai Fletcher appeared before the Naval
Wiir College and there met with the i
criticism that he had violated one of
the fundamentals of naval strategy by
dividing Instead of concentrating his
force.
Admiral Fletcher contended that the
material elements ot the siiufiuon were
sucli as to call for a division which, un
der the clrcumstnnces, could
slrued ns violating the ruin
tratlon. Iletween the two,
concentration and material
control ersy seems to 11.
Aillillrill I'letelier's Views.
Admiral neither before the war col
lege explained that tint purpose nf the
m in.rtivres as set down by the Navy
Department was to operate and exercise
the Meet, and defended the course he had
followed by saying that his "plan may
not apparently have been In acrnrdah''e 1
with . el tain general principles of con-'

Hear Admiral Knight, the umpire tn
the war game, look the opposite view
"The principle of .oiicentr.itlnn." he'
Mild, "was violated by the lllue force.
"Admiral Fletcher gave Ills reason

Honing of uniformed patrolmen at sub

on Satunlay night had anything to do
with bomb plotting, It was a dragnet
for thieves, was the police explanation.
As soon as the special squads or pa.

I way entrances at II o'clock night before
last word got aioiind that they were
there to search all packages curled by
passengers to prevent bomb outrages,
either feared or dltectly warned against,'
and liit evening newsboys shouting
their wares added their noisy mite to tho .
rumors by cries of dynamite and wreck
in tlie subway.
Deputy Commissioner Frank A, lnrd,
in charge of the detective bureau and the
one responsible f.ir the order, said that
there was no basis for the sensational
reports,
"Wo have been busy In getting after
certain thieves for sortie time," he said,
"and now we are simply Increasing our
vigilance In an effort to effect a roundup
of them, I can't tell you on what night

"Our sheets show a steady decrease In

of bundles. Last night's order was for

order to belli round, up thieves, I have
