TALK PEACE AGAIN!
• WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 7. 1
—In the chancelleries of Ktunpe,
according to advices received here
today, there Is far more talk of
peace than appears on the surface.
The discussion Is focusing grad
ually and some day soon definite
terms will take form.
Stimulated by this European
renewal of interest in the subject,
a great number of leading Ameri-
cans have expressed their views
today on the subject of possible
peace terms. A composite treaty,
drafted from the suggestions of
30 representative leaders is print
ed herewith.
Here are parts of some of the
comments they made:

I'nlvei.il).
I pee no signs of an early peace
in Kiirope; and should find any
peace made on the basis of the
. present military successes of Ger
many a horrible disaster for the
humun race.

Terms should emlHidy:
I a. Recognition of right of
small nationalities.
I). Limitation of armaments.
c. Destruction of militarism.
d. International agreement for
future arbitration.
c. League for enforcement of
peace.
f. Democratization of diplom

g. Fair adjustment of terri
tory and rights so as to reduce
motives of revenge.

If anyone of sufficient prom
inence, as, for Instance, the presi
dent of the United States, the
. head of the Catholic church, or
the excutives of neutral coun
tries acting tt.^ether, wovld tiige
upon the belligerent nations a
simultaneous announcement of
the terms upon which peace would
be accomplished — which Is only
another way of declaring to the
public the principles for which
. they are fighting—it is probable
that either side could, by plainly
announcing its terms, compel the
other side to do likewise, for what
nation would he willing to admit
by refusal that it did not know
for what It was fighting, or that
knowing, it was not willing to let
the public know.

ASKS SUPPORT
IN RATE FIGHT
If Tacoma and Northwest busi
ness men win their fight against
the Harriman railroads, and the
interstate commerce commission
knocks out the tourist blockade
here there Is nothing, it was
learned today, to jprevent the
Hariman roads from dropping
their rates still lower and creat
ing another situation exactly sim
ilar.
"But with the united support
of every business man," declared
Chairman 0. A. Reynolds, of the
public service commission, who
has led » ■<■ fight thus far, "we
can overSme the possibility of
such a catastrophe. '
Liv Must He Changed.
He pointed out that the Harri
man interests control a tourist
rate from Chicago lo San Fran
cisco and return, via the South
ern lines, $17.50 cheaper than
the tourist rate between the same
terminals via the Northwest,
though the distance this way la
253 miles shorter.
"We are trying to equalize
those rates," he said. "But if we
succeed, the Harri-nan railroads
could drop their rates $17.50
lower, and we could not inter
fere, under the provisions of the
present interstate commerce act
of 1910."
Drafting a Rill.
Reynolds, however, is prepar
ing a bill which he will present
to Senator Miles Poindexter and
Congressman Will E. Humphrey
for Introduction in both houses
of congress amending the inter
state commerce act to empower
the commission to fix a minimum
rate.
Such an amendment, he says,
will block the Harriman interests
from any such move and insure
equal rates once the present pref
erential is eliminated.
Reynolds has wired an appeal
to both representatives in con
gress, asking them to Introduce
the proposed amendment bill.
Their replies followj
"Prepare and forward such bill
as you think I should introduce,
together with reasons wby such
legislation should be enacted.
(Signed)
"W. E. HUMPHREY."
"Will be glad to introduce bill
as requested. Will appreciate de
tailed information as to opera
tion and effect on Northwest of
Joint rate preferential."

HOW IT LOOKS FROM TACOMA
Beware of Avalanches and
Floods, Warns Weather Man
Tscoma and western Washing
ton are threatened with heavy
floods within the next 36 hours.
Dangerous avalanches are
likely on the west slope of the
Cascades.
These were the official predic
tions of the U. S. weather bureau
in a delayed report late this
morning.
While the snow had been melt
ing gradually up to noon today
land it appealed that Taconia and
tlie surrounding country might be
let off easily, official reports in
dicated that a southwest wind is
bringing warm air currents from
Oregon which was swept by a
flood-carying Chinook last night.
I'd. alliip River Rising.
With the upper Willamette liv
er rising several inches an hour,
Portland shippers began to move
their goods away from the lower
docks this morning. The Chi
nook which swept the valley last
night, melting the snow which has
covered the ground for a month,
has sent a torrent down every
gully.
The crest of the flood is near
Corvallis today.
As the result of the thaw and
rain of yesterday the I'uyallup
river has risen two feet. If th.
warm winds hit us within tho
next 36 hours, as predicted, the
river threatens to overflow Its
banks, and backed by torrents
from the mountains and foothills,
send a disastrous flood over the
valley.
No Present Danger.
County Engineer White said a
heavy rain, together with the
warm winds, would be very seri
ous, but that as long as the thaw
contlnues at Its present rate (here
is no danger.
Engineer Roberts of the inter
county river improvement board
mid that the present barriers of
the I'uyallup withstood a 10-foot
rise during December. He does
not look for floods unless it
rains or warm winds come. The
thaw is gradual at the headwaters
so far, while many of the con
tributing streams are blocked.
This keeps the great rush of wa
ter checked.
