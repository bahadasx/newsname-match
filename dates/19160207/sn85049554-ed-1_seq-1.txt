Organization to Combat War in Eu
rope and Preparedness at Home.
Chicago, Feb. 7.—"If the people of
this .country let the government get
into the hands of the politicians who
want to lead them Into war they are
foolish. Preparedness is war." We in
the United States don't want war, but
the men tvho get us preparedness will
find us a war."
Henry Ford flung this over his
shoulder yesterday as he boarded a
Michigan Central. train at noon to re
turn to Detroit. The gaunt, kindly
automobile manufacturer and oppo
nent of armaments had abandoned the
policy of silence which almost kept
him away from the Michigan society's
banquet Saturday evening. He was
genial, brisk—almost discursive.
Plans New Organization.
He admitted frankly what he had
intimated in a brief interview the night
before-—that a new campaign against
fighting in Europe and preparedness In
America is to he begun under his lead
ership within a week—and added that
he Is getting together "an organization
that will be just as efficient as ny
automobile business." He hinted it
may involve "another trip across the
water."
"But I don't care to give out my
plans now," he said, settling back on
the soft cushions In his stateroom.
"I'll have them formulated within a
few days. And I don't mind saying to
you right now that I am in this fight
with preparedness to the finish.
"Colonel Roosevelt is letting himself
out on me on this peace propaganda.
"Well, he can exercise himself if he
wishes. A good many people think
because I haven't said much of late
that I've quit. .Why, from now on I
am going to fight harder than ever."

German Government Offers
Substitute For Objection
able Word "Illegal"
REPRISALS ONLY
AGAINST ENEMIES
Expresses Hope For Opportunity to As
sist United Statea in Securing Free
dom of Seas—British Blookade Re
ferred to as Inhuman—Secretary
Lansing Denies That United States
Made New Demands in Last Note.
JWashington, Feb. 7.—Germany has
agreed that reprisals must not be di
rected against any other than enemy
subjects. This expression if offered by
Germany to take place of the phrase
containing the word "illegal" which was
incorporated in the draft of the Lusi
tania agreement now under considera
tion. It also became known that Ger
many expresses the hope that It may
have 'the opportunity to co-operate
with the United States in some action
looking toward the freedom of the seas
before the end of the war.
This statement is taken in high dip
lomatic circles to imply that the Ber
lin government sees no occasion to
await the cessation of hostilities before
settling that issue.
Furthermore, the German govern
ment refers to tjie British blockade of
Germany as being inhuman, calls at
tention to the fact that neutral vessels
have been affected by the efforts of the
British government to starve Germany,
and puts forth the contention that the
German retaliation in the North sea is
justified by the actions of Great Brit
ain. Claims that the reprisals are legal
are not mentioned.
Chairman Stone, of the senate for
eign relations oommlttee, said today
after conferences with administration
officials, Ithat it was his impression that
the Lusitania case was "practloally
settled." He did not go into details*
No N« Demand* Mad*.
Secretary Lansing today flatly, de
nled-that wew doraands-hitibeSn'metde
in the'Lusitania case at-a time when
the German government considered the
negdttat!6fl«r practically were at* an end.
Ha was speaking of the Hertin dis
patch quoting the reference by Dr.
Zimmerman. German under secretary
or foreign affairs, to "new Remands."
"This government." said Secretary
Lansing, "has not increased the de
mands made in the Lusitania cose as
set forth in the notes of May 13, June
9, and July 21. I doubt if Dr. Zim
merman ever made the statement, that
new demands have been injected for Ije
knew it was utterly false."
Zimmerman Statement Ignorf d.
Secretary Lansing would not discuss
Dr. Zimmerman's statement further.
When the statement was published In
this country, however, his reference to
new demands was taken to apply to
a possible construction of the word
"illegal" In the proposed form of set
tlement. The only ground American of
ficials could find for constructing that
as embodying a new demand was the
possibility that It misrht be considered
not alone to the destruction of neutrals
on the Lusitania but to the method by
which she was sunk.
Secretary Lansing repeated that he
expected to confer with the president
some time during the day.

Twenty Years in Congress.
In his twenty years of service in
congress Mr. Hepburn won fame for
many activities, but is remembered
mainly for his work in framing what
is known as the Hepburn -law, the law
that prohibits rebates and discrimina
tion by railroads. It was under his
leadership that some of the most im
portant railroad legislation of the last
quarter century was worked out and
placed on the statute books.
Like many other big men of his time
in congress, Mr. Hepburn is a product
of the early pioneer days of the middle
west. He was born In Ohio in 1833,
but was brought to Iowa when 8 years
old. He got what little schooling he
had in three winters at an academy,
averaging three months a year. Later
he worked in a printing office. When
he decided to study law he went to
Chicago, where for $30 a month he ran
the office and worked as janitor for his
teacher.

When the civil war broke out Colonel
Hepburn organized a company at Mar
shalltown and became its captain. This
company went to the front in Febru
ary, 1862, as a part of the Second Iowa
cavalry. He was soon advanced to the
rank of major and in that position

and in December of the same year a
lieutenant colonel and was put in com
