WASHINGTON, D C, Feb. 7
Germanv has agreed that re
prisals must not be directed
against any other than enemy subjects
This expression is offered by Germanv
to take the place of the pb-ase contain
mg the word "Illegal, winch was in
corporated In the draft of the Lousi
tania agreement now under consider i
tion
This statement is taken in higl
diplomatic circles ta imply that the
Berlin government sees no occasion to
await the cessation of hostilities be
tore settling; that issue.
Furthermore, the German. t-nirnrnniMii
(refers to the" British: bloakade ot Ge-
HMtny as bsjlng- Inhumane calls atten
tion to the Tact that neutral Vessels
have been affected by the efforts ef the
British government to starve Germanv
and puts forth the contention that the
German retaliation in the war zone
around the British Isles Is Justified bv
the actions of Great Brit-Un. Claims
that the reprisals are legal are not
mentioned.
The sinking of the Lousitama was at
the time considered an act of reprisal
against Great Britain because of tbe
British orders in council shutting of
Germany s food imports In the Lusi
tania case, however. Americans and
other neutrals were made to suffer th.
effect of the reprisal.
o "New Demands" Lnnnlo?.
Secretary of state Lansing today flat
ly denied that new demands had been
made in the Lusi tania case at a tim
when the German government consid
ered the negotiations practically -were
at an end He was speaking of the Ber
lin dispatches quoting the references
bv Dr. Zimmerman, German under sec
retary of foreign affairs, to "new de
mands." ,
Doubts 7imniernian' Statement.
"This government" said secretarv
Lansing, has not increased the de
mands made in the Lusitama case as
set forth in the notes of May 1?, June
9 and July 21 I doubt if Dr Zlrmner
man ever made the statement that new
demands had been Injected, because he
must know that it is utterly false "
Secretary Lansing would not discuss
Dr Zimmerman s statement further
When Dr Zimmerman's statement was
published in this country, however, his
reference to new demands was taken
to apply to a possible construction on
the word "illegal" in the proposed form
of settlement The only ground Amer
ican officials could find for construing
that as embodying a new demand was
the possibility that it might be consid
ered applicable not alone to the de
struction of neutrals on the Lusltania,
but also as to the methods by which
she was sunk
Secretary Lansing repeated that he
expected to confer with president Wil
son some time during the dav
Disavowal In Irahle Csmf.
It Is explained that a direct disavow
al was given for the sinking of the
Arabic because that act was in viola
tion of the instructions given the com
manders of the submarines. In the
I case of the Lusitania, however, the
commander actea in accordance wren
orders The general instructions not to
sink liners without warning was given.
It is disclosed by high authority, on
the day after the Lusltania went down.
It was said that Germany withheld an
nouncement of the fact for strategical
naval reasons.
The position of Berlin officials Is said
to be that the act ef the commander of
a submarine can be disavowed, should
he violate, disregard or have failed to
receive instructions, but that tho gov
ernment cannot disavow an act which
was committed in accordance with its
Instructions and for which It is respon
sible o Denial of Responsibility.
In the latest proposal there is no at
tempt to deny responsibility for the
sinking of the Lusitania But Germanv
assumes liability for the American lives
lost offers reparation bv the payment
of indemnity auo assures the United
States that the killing of Americans
was without intent Tho tentativo
communication also states that the
method of conducting submarine wai
fare in the North sea has been modi
fied because of friendship for the Unit
ed States and because of tbe fact that
American lives bad been lost
Won't Fight for One Word.
Secretary Lansing Indicated that
some announcement might be given out
for publication within the next few
dav s.
Thete was no Indication today
whether the president had definitely
decided whether Germany's latest pro
posal was satisfactory
Administration officials let It be
known that a mere choice of words
would not be permitted to stand in the
