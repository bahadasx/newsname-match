the country bad misjudged moat of
tbei Southern Democrats who hsve op

I believe those members of congress
who feel aa I do are In favor of any

ject which haa accentuated ua In mak

tha only men who accomplish anything
here are tha men who atand up and

a compromise will have to be effected
and In securing that compromise
something wilt be gained for the cauae
for which they contend."
The fact that the hour for compro
mising seems to have arrived In the
house of representatives, at least, on
thla question of preparedness, would
seem to Indicate that there la a large
element of truth In what thla congress
man aaya concerning tbe attitude of

Thla Rryan equation la going to

with the slie of that problem next
