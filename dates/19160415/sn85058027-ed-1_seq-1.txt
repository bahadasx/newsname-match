I Sensational Report
I of Pacific Strike
0
SAID TO CONTAIN ONE FOOF OF GRAY COPPER CAR-
RYING HIGH VALUES IN SILVER AND WORTH
$100,000 PER CAR.
H Word came down from the
B canyon yesterday, which, if
I true, is the most important
I that has come out of the can
H yon since its discovery- It is
that a big- strike has been made
in the north drift of the
I Pacific that carries gray
H copper, a carload of which
I would be worth over $100,000.
I The ore is said to be so high in
I silver that it will assay 30 per
I cent in the white metal; not
I 30 oz., but 30 per cent.
I It is vell known that some
ore carrying gray copper has
I been found as the drift has
H proceeded to the north, and
I several tons have been put by
H itself, intending to reservo it
until a car lot had accumulat
ed. But the report that came
down yesterda', and apparent
ly from an authentic source, is
that there is about one foot of
the rich rock, which, if true,
will be the sensation of the
state for the year.
It is also well known that
some of this class of ore has
been found in the upper work
ings to the north in years past,
,and Peter Miller's friends
have claimed that this is the
, reason why he has confined'
! nearly all his efforts in drift
ing to the north since cutting
the vein with his deep tunnel.
Confirmation of the report
will be awaited with the keen
est interest.

lSen.-)tor",j: irWootton announces
that noxt week he will havo completed
arrangements to commence a bunch of
miners to work on tho South I'nrk
property This group of lfi clnlms
ndjolim tho Pnclfle and Pittsburg,
both shipping properties, and runs
ovor to th0 .Mountain l.nke linos. As
sociated with tho senator Is Manager
Ilelf of tho Hotel I'tah and other Salt
Iako cnpltnllsts. Tho mnnngement Is
confident of having the extension of
tho Pacific fissure, and Intends start
ing a tunnel from tho cast sldo of the
Pittsburg hill to cut It nt depth.
Jacob Kvons Is authority for the
i stntcment thnt tho C.lobo Consolidated
will lmve n force or miners driving a
now tunnel on their properly by the
first of May. Tho Globe lies between
the Karl-ICaglo and tho Holorophnn,
next tho southwest sldo lines of the
Ynnhco. A lo: of hard work hns been
dono In tho hnid lime, but tho recent
development In tho Dirl-Knglo nnd
tho finding of the fissure on tho Yan
kee nnd Uelorophan hns shown" thnt
tho oro Is lo bo found by" driving n
tunnel lower down.
An event thnt will mean much to
the canyon Is the meeting thnt will
bo held In this city today, wherein
tho old Whirlwind .Mining company
will bo reorganized nnd tho new or
ganization ho placed under tho con
trol of the mining wlrnrd Charley
Tyng. Tho deal has been grensed and
I will go through without any friction.
The Whlilwlnd lies directly In tho
pnth of where i!Ovinment ronnrt snyf
tho Pacific fissure llei. The old
management In n deep tunnel cut the
biggest sulphide vein that has been
opened In tho canyon, whose ore
weighs oer 200 pounds to tho sack.
Since tho Pacific has proven tho di
rection, permnnonco nnd richness of
Its fissure, the Whirlwind has como
to bo regarded as one of the biggest
possibilities In tho camp. With the
oxtenslvo development woik already
accomplished and the push and fore
sight back of tho now management,
tho Whirlwind Is counted on to be-
como ono of tho new shippers before
tho summer Is well advanced.
Last Mondnv the -I'tnli Centeiinlnl
held Its annual election, re-electing nil
of lis old officer. A pollcv of actlvo
development work wns decided on nnd
the Centennlnl Is thoroughly equipped
with cabins, cars, tools, etc., to com
nienco work nt once. It lies ou Pitts
burg Hill, directly In n line botwoen
tho Pittsburg and Pacific. About f.00
feet of tunnels hnvo already boon run
and the faro of the deepest one Is now
nonrlng the juncture of where the fis
sure will cut the lime shnle contnst
