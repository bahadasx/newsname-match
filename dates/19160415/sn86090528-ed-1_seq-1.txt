PLANNING TO START
TOUR OF INSPECTION
Aldermen Caneman, Cavett and Loren
sen Compose Investigating Committee;
Cet Best for Least Money is
Idea of Mayor
Mayor Coffman this morning an
nounced the appointment of the special
committee which will examine the,
different makes of fire fighting ma
chinery before Dialling the purchase,
as authorized by the voters at the re
cent city election.
The committee, following their in
vestigation and pending the final ac
tion, will advise with a committee of
citizens, appointed by Mayor Coff
man this morning to serve as a spe
cial advisory committee.
The "Investigating" committee, ap
pointed by the mayor, is composed of
the following members of the city
council: Caneman, Cavett and Lo
rensen. The citizens' committee has
u membership vof L. C. Mutson, Myron
Humphrey and Howard Gilkey.
Mayor Coffniaii will act as chairman
of the special committee and Fire
Chief Gattls will be an cx-offitio mem
ber of the same.
Mayor Coffman stated this morning
that he did not know just when the
committee would "get busy," but
tbmight it would be right away, pos
sibly Sunday night. He will call the
committee, together this" afternoon, be
tween four uml five o'clock, for the
purpose of outlining the work to be
done. At this afternoon's meeting it
will be derided where and when the
committee will go.
""he mayor stated this morning that
lie did not favor visiting cities where
on!? ono kind ot fire fighting appa
ratus wa,s In use, but thought such
plates should be visited wherein two
nr mon makes of equipment was in
every-d'y, practical t:se. By doing
this M. Coffman thinks that the
best machinery may lie bought at the
least posslblo expense.
The trip of Inspection may lead to
Kansas City and Dallas. In event
this trip Is taken, the committee will
go I v Tulsa, stopping off there to in
ppcrt the apparatus of that i My. From
Fansas City the committee may re
turn by Wichita, stopping off to In
upect the apparatus at that place and
continuing on to Dallas, where two
different kinds of auto apparatus is in
use. Returning from Dallas a stop
may be made at Fort Worth, that city
also having two or more kinds of auto
fire fighting equipment on bands.
The mayor figures that this tr.,
will be in the interests or economy
and will result In the city obtaining
the maximum service. In the auto ma
rhinery bought, at the minimum of
cost.
Mayor Coffman stated this morning
that be bad appointed the advisory
committee in order that the members
of the council could benefit by the
advice of successful Chickasha busi
ness men in the matter of the final
purchase In the selection of this
committer Mr. Coffman has eliminat
ed all ideas of politics. In speaking
In this connection this morning, Mr.
Coffman said that did not care what
the man'B politics was whom he ap
pointed upon the committee; that his
object was to select men who were
hard- headed business men, men
who , had handled their own
and ' their company's money in
such a manner as to show
that they " were familiar w ith all
details of any and - every business
transaction.
"I do not want anyone to gain the
impression," said Mayor Coffman
this morning, "that I favor buying
porno cheap, clap-trap piece ot fire
lighting equipment. I want the peo
ple of this city to understand, how
ever, that the mayor of the city and
the members of the city council are
the hired bands of the city and than
leel, and the different members of the
council foel, that we should handle
the city's money and tho city's busi.
ness just as we would each handle our
own business. I propose to make
haste by going slowly iu this matter
and I favor getting the best possible
equipment for the city for the least
possible cost. The machinery we buy
must be good and efficient; it must
deliver the goods from tho start to
the finish; It must stand up under
practical test and it must be sold at
a price which will bo encompassed by
tho bounds of reason."

MAN'S MIND
DERANGED
IS BELIEF
Col. Barefoot Says All Signs Indicate Ed
Woodson Was Temporarily Insane'
When He Attacked His Wife
and Suicided
All the evidence points to tho con
clusion that Ed T. Woodson's mind
was unbalanced when he. attacked his
wife with a knife, inflicting a number
of flesh wounds, and then ended his
own life with the same instrument, at
his home in Oklahoma City Wednes
day, according to Col. Geo. W. Bare
foot, father of Mrs. Woodson, who
camo home from Oklahoma City last
night.
Mrs. Woodson is still tn tne Hospital
but is recovering fast and will bo tas.
en home Monday. Mrs. Barefoot re
trained with her.
"On several previous occasions Mr.
Woodson had made threats against his
family but his mood would change
suddenly and he would become as
kind and considerate as any man
could be," said Col. Barefoot. "After
he had had one or two of his vicious,
threatening moods, his wife wrote let
ters to tell us about it but as he
quickly became perfectly normal she
never mailed them. If he had been
sane he would never have used the
instrument lie did in carrying out a
deliberate -purpose to injure or kill.
It was an old barlow knife and he
stabbed himself ten times with it in
a space over his heart not larger than
a dollar. It is unthinkable that a mmt
in his right mind could have taken
such a terrible way to end his life.
There was no evidence that he hd
been drinking, as some have thought.
His deed can be attributed to nothing
but temporary insanity."
Mr. Woodson was one of the most
trusted employ.es of the Western Un
ion Telegraph company which he had
rerved for about thirty years. As an
other evidence of his mental condition
Cel. Barefoot said on one occasion it
least, ho had toid his family that he
was short with the company and was
;o:iig away to South America. As a
matter of fact, Col. Barefoot says, he
nover handled any of the company's
funds, except very small amounts and
his accounts were perfectly straight,
officers of the company state.
Mr. Woodson was at ont Mrut a dis
patcher in the Rock iaiand office in
Chickasha. Tho oldest of the Wood
son children, a son about 21 years of
age, is in the Western Union offices
at Oklahoma City.

ed in Judge fuller's court yesterday
afternoon and held for trial on April
17, in bomIsin the sum of $200 on
charges of petit larceny. As soon as
th'j case is disposed of George will
possibly bo called upon to face grand
larceny charges. George is the negro

charge relates to a pair of shoes.
BROWNSON
IS VISITED
BY BURGLAR
Some one entered tho Brownson
drug store in the First National bank
building, during Friday night, and ri
fled the cash register of its contents,
obtaining thereby, it is stated, be
tween six and seven dollars in cash.
The dispensing cabinet was also visit
ed and some morphine and cocaine
taken. Nothing else was missed.
The robbery was discovered this
morning by Mr. Brownson. The back
door of the store was open and the
supposition is that some one had eith
er provided himself with a key which
opened that door, or else had hidden
in the rear of the store some time
during the day and had suffered im
selC to be locked in the store at the
hour of closing, effecting his egress
thrrugh the rear door after having
helped himself to the things which
suited his fancy.
The police have been notified and
are at work upon the case. Up to
date tho officers have no clue, but are
working upon the theory that some
"hop head" was the burglar.
