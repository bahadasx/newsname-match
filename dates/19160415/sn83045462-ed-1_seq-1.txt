DIPLOMATIC BREAK
NEAROVERU-BOATS;
TO INDICT GERMANY
President Has Support of All
Cabinet Members in Decision
Regarding Sussex Stand.
NO ROOM FOR QUIBBLE
IN FINAL NOTIFICATION
To Send Virtual Ultimatum Within
Few Days, Stating German Failure
to Explain Acts.
MAY REQUEST PROMPT REPLY
If Relations Afe Severed. Nation
Will Make Clear to World Berlin's
Disregard of Promises
Made. I
A break in the diplomatic relations
of the I'nited States with
Germany inside of two weeks
was todav forecast bv men on
the inside of the administration
who generally know what they
arc talking about.
The only thing that will prevent
this break is Germany's unequivocal
promise, in clear and
distinct words, that she will adhere
front now on to her promises
in the Lusitania case and
that vessels will not be torpedoed
until after waning thai
must be seen and understood by
the commanders of vessels.
Sees Only One Course.
President Wilson, it is positively
known today, has reached the stage
where he cannot see anything to the
controversy with Germany but the severance
of relations, and he is prepared.
? It is said, to make thie severance in a
manner that will impress the world
with Germany's disregard of her promises.
her unconcern over violation of international
laws and her utter callousness
to the destruction of neutral
human life.
There was evidence today that at the
cabinet meeting yesterday the entire
cabinet agreed with the President that
he had gone as far as possible without
drastic action against Germany, and
that his final notification to Germany ol
this official feeling must be in such
clear and distinct words as no longer to
leave room for quibble.
Virtually an Ultimatum.
As near as can be gathered today,
the program of the President is to send
to Germany within a few days what
will be virtually an ultimatum. It will
inform Germany that her promises to
the United States have apparently beer
disregarded and will request a clear
unmistakable statement of what hei
future attitude is to be.
Except that there will be no tim?
limit fixed for Germany's answer th
^-uiumunica.nun 10 me Kaiser a government
will be an ultimatum. It will ever
no so far, it is predicted, as to requesl
a prompt answer.
The communication will set forth
some of the many submarine disasters
that have happened since the Dusitania
promise and the failure of the Germai
government to explain them satisfactorily
to the world. It will be substantially
an indictment of Germany, lik*
that leveled at a man about to be trieri
in the courts of the United States. And
that is what President Wilson wishes
the communication to be. The communication
is expected to be framed
for ultimate publication to the world
although unusual efforts will be made
to guard its contents from becoming
known in advance.
The President and State Department
will not wish The communication to be
unown until Germany's answer is re
reived, as tl^rc is no purpose to embarrass
that government.
Not a Declaration of War.
President Wilson is far from expecting
American participation in the conflict
in Europe, even though Ambassador
yon Bernstorff is handed his passports.
It was believed today that wher
this expected event lakes place tht
President will issue a statement thai
the action of the United States does noi
mean a declaration of war against Germany.
but does mean that the Unitec
States feels that it can no longer associate
in the brotherhood of nationi
with Germany. The President's object
will be a moral lesson to the world uric
to Germany, a notice that the Unitec
States will consort on terms of friendlines*
only with nations that compl)
with international law and hold alway>
in view the rights of humanity gen
rally
High offic ials of the administration d<
not believe today thai the prospective
break will mean thai this country will
ver participate to an important degre*
in the war. Whether the United Statei
take.- any step hostile to Germany ai
all will depend, it is suggested, upor
Germany's submarine course after th<
v?...c?>. onwuiu sne pursue hei
present course, the l.'nited States would
it is thought, adopt means of sending
war vessels to foreign waters, particularly
to guard vessels upon whict
Americans are traveling.
Kot Welcome to Germany.
President Wilson is said to be prettj
firmly convinced today that German}
will not wish to have the moral weighi
of this country against her. Its effec
upon neutral nations will be immense.
Secretary Lansing continued wort

it might already have been started 01

POTOMAC BRIDGE
House Committee Views Given
to War Department by
Chairman Adamson.
SECRETARY BAKER THINKS
THE PROJECT IS FEASIBLE
i Plan Tc for Substantial Structure to
1 Arlington Cemetery Minus Expensive
Memorial Features.
According to Representative W. C.
Adamson. chairman of the House committee
on interstate and foreign commerce,
which committee has charge of
bridge legislation, that committee will
favor a hill providing for a substantial
bridge across the Potomac river from
the foot of New York avenue to Arlington
cemetery, to cost not more than
$4,000,000. He embodied the views of
the committee in a letter to the Secretary
of War. showing clearly the opposition
of the committee to the old plan
of building "a memorial bridge" at that
point according to the approved plans
of Architect Fuijt, estimated to cost
$6,000,000.
"The committee has no intention, as 1
understand their idea." said Representative
Adamson. "to fall into the old
memorial bridge idea, noj* do I believe
that Conc-rcss is in anv hurrv to pass
any such legislation, nor that it has
ever been. This committee, for the
eighteen years I have been a member
of it. has been of the idea that a substantial.
useful bridge should be built,
without gewgaws or superfluous ornamentation.
to extend from the foot of
New York avenue across to Arlington,
the bridge to be in keeping with the
magnificence of the Treasury building
and the t'apitol. The committee has
no sympathy with the gewgaws and
flummery and great expense suggested
in a memorial bridge plan. The committee
prefers to put every dollar spent
in the substance of the bridge and to
build a bridge so substantially and so
well that it will last forever, in so*far
as human ingenuity can do that, and
then follow that up with a provision
that private capital, patriotic societies
and anybody else who pleases may put
memorials on the bridge, with the approval
of the government officials authorized
to pass on it.
Sends Copy of Bill.
"Inasmuch as you have had the
labor of going over this matter again,
J w ill send you a copy of a bill and ask
you if it is possible to build such a
bridge as planned by that bill for $4,!
000.000. leaving out the word 'memorial'
and leaving out, all of the incidentals
and memorial features and the
expenses carried with them. If such a
substantial structure can be built for
$4,000,000, I believe the committee and
Congress would authorize it, but I do
not think they are disposed at this time
to go beyond that.
"On three previous occasions a subcommittee
from this committee has
prepared such a plan, but before it
could have it acted on in tT.e House
the Senate has broken up the scheme
- by putting the same old idea on an
appropriation bill, and we have been
compelled to go in the House and help
kill it. If the patriotic people who
have been pretending to want this
bridge will joirt with us and help secure
the erection of a good, useful,
substantial structure, leaving some
margin for those clamoring for the
proposed memorial features to show
I their patriotism by contributing money
to make the memorial feature, in
I my judgment they can get a bridge
that would he worthy of the capital.
' "If your department will kindly read
( this letter and answer the question
whether a substantial bridge, without
plummery and gewgaws, can be built
for $4,000,000 we would be glad for
you to do so. as that is what this committee
would like to know. If the
' bill is reported out, it will be reported
! out in such a way as to require it to
be built for $4,000,000 or whatever sum
is requisite to build the kind of a
1 bridge 1 have described."
Feasible, Mr. Baker Replies.
' Tn reply to Representative Adamson's
L letter. Secretary Baker said that after
consideration of the subject by the department
he is of opinion that "it will
t be possible to construct a bridge of
I simple design and yet of a monumental
' character, for the amount named by
1 you i Mr. Adamson), $4,000,000." The
' Secretary added that if Mr. Adamson
' desired to go further with the matter
he would be pleased to draft a bill em'
bodying such features as are deemed
essential by the department in a bill
of that kind.

TEACHERS PLANNING
TO FORM A UNION
200 Tutors in Five White High
Schools Here Will Comprise
Membership.
| MAY BE THE FORERUNNER
OF NATIONAL FEDERATION
Will Hold Charter in A. F. of L. at
Outset?Organizers Adopt Resolutions
at Meeting.
Plans have been launched for the organization
into a union to be affiliated
with the American Federation of Labor
of the 200 teachers of the five white
high schools of this city. Forty teachers
who were present at the preliminary
meeting held at the Central High
School several days ago have signed a
call, which today is being sent to the
other teachers of these schools, asking
them to join the union. The proposed
union will only hold its charter
in the American Federation of Labor
until such a time as there are enough
teachers' organizations all over the
country to form a National Federation
of Teachers. When the latter federa
tion is formed the Federation of Labor
| will withdraw its charter.
The officials of the schools have no
objection to the formation of the
union. Supt. Thurston of the local
schools today said the officials have
ample confidence in the teachers, and
also declared they had a perfect right
to unionize if they wanted to.
Temporary Officers Named.
The temporary officers of the new
organization are I,. V. Lampson, chairman:
G. J. Jones, secretary, and Miss
Sara F\ Ljfnch, treasurer. The following
have been selected to canvass the
sentiment in their respective schools:
Alvin W. Miller, Business: G. J. Jones
and L. V. Lampson, Central; W. J.
Wallis, Eastern; Miss Genevieve Marsh,
McKinley, and Miss Lilly A. Chester,
Western. j
Chairman La/npson today said he expected
a majority of t he-teachers would
become affiliated with the union. He
also declared the teachers had no
grievances at this time, hut that the
organization was being formed for
mutual protection.
Another meeting of the organizers
will be held in Central High School
Thursday afternoon at 3:15 o'clock,
when all teachers who have paid the
initiation fee will be expected to attend.
The purpose of this meeting is to
select a committee on constitution.
There has been no attempt to force
any of the teachers to join the union.
In fact, they are urged to investigate
carefully the matter before joining: the
organization, and the call instructs
them as to where they dan get all the
information they desire on the question.
Basis for Formation of Union.
The basis for the formation of the
union is outlined in the call as follows:
"Every class of people in the country,
including capital, labor and the
professions, have nation-wide organizations
for their protection and wellbeing.
The teachers alone remain in
an unorganized condition.
"The teachers of this country, through j
the molding of the political thought .
and the developing of the economic ef- !
flciencv of each succeeding generation
of citizens, control, more than any other
class ofipeople, the future of the republic,
and have the least control over
their own destiny.
"A nation-wide organization of teachers.
consolidated for protection, would
he recognized by the political parties,!
by capital, and hv labor as a body pos- |
sessing^ unwonted power.
"Such an organization would give the !
teachers of the country a voice in their j
own affairs which they do not at pres- j
j eni possess. I

ASKS COURT FOR LINCOLN
Counsel for British Consul Files
Reasons for Demanding
Extradition.
Counsel for the British consul general
at New York today filed with th<
Supreme Court a brief setting forth
the reasons for demanding the extradition
of Ignatius Timothy Tribich IJn
coin from the United States to Kngland
011 a charge of forgery.
Lincoln was formerly a member ol
parliament and figured in a sensational
escape from custody in New York after
his arrest for extradition. He sought
his freedom from extradition in habeas
corpus proceedings in the New York
federal courts, and, defeated there, he
appealed to the Supreme Court. His
appeal will be considered Monday,
when oral arguments will be heard.
Lincoln Charges Political Reasons.
Lincoln claims the British government
is seeking extradition in order to
try him for a political offense.
Counsel for the consul general pointed
out in his brief that in the treaty
between the United States and Great
Britain is a provision that 110 one surrendered
by either country shall be
tried or punished for any political
rime or offense. He urged the court
would not presume Great Britain would
violate the treaty by trying Lincoln
'or any political offepse.

NOT BEING HUB
Several Days May Elapse Before
the Communication
Is Completed.
U.S. TROOPS MEANWHILE
KEEP UP VILLA PURSUIT
Officials Here Inclined to Think
Parral Fight May Have Been
Exaggerated.
Secretary Lansing pronounced
the Mexican situation unchanged
today in any aspect.
Unless official reports to Gen.
Funston disclose a more grave
situation at Parral. where American
troops were fired upon, than
is now believed to exist, there
was nothing to indicate that a
change might he expected in the
near future.
Three Days Without News.
Secretary Baker said Gen. Funston
had not heard from Gen. Pershing directly
for three days. That caused no
uneasiness at the War Department,
however, as Gen. Pershing; has reported
only when he had definite and important
information to communicate. Deports
from other commanders in the
field gave no new status to the pursuit
of Villa and his bandits.
As time passes without official information
of the Parral fighting; from
American sources officials are inclined
! to doubt that the clash was as serious
j as described in early Mexican advices,
j It was considered unlikely that the
American force was in any serious
plight, since the commander might
have sent back messengers to the nearest
supporting column.
f . Think Parral Is Passed.
| Some army officials thought it probable
that when a report was received
it would show the detachment had
passed iri or around Parral since the
disorder and was proceeding about its
business of pursuing Villa, headed for
its original destination beyond the
town.
Publication in Mexico City of the
terms the Carranza government seeks j
; to impose limiting any reciprocal j
troops movements across the interna-;
m tional boundary shed much light on the \
diplomatic tangle which preceded Gen.
Carranza's suggestion that the American
troops he recalled from Mexico.
Secretary Lansing declined to discuss
the matter. At the time the de facto
government suggested that no expedim
tionary force should exceed 1,000 cavalrymen
and not cross a dead line
, there were several thousand American
troops of all arms in Mexico, and they
B were 200 miles or more south of the
border.
Embassy Without Advices.
| j Eliseo Arrendondo, Gen. Carranza's
j ambassador here, said today he had no
j further information of the fighting
' at Parral. nor of reports of a later '
1 -clash, and had been advised of no dej
velopments in Gen. Carranza's proposal
j for the withdrawal of American troops,
j Dispatches to the Carranza embassy
, : said the arrival of tlie general and his
party in Mexico City was accompanied
- j by a popular demonstration.
A battle at Cuernavaca. the Zapata
- I stronghold, was reported imminent.
I 'I'll/. 1 !

f forces was said to he in plain sight of
the fortress.
> Secretary Lansing has given no indication
ms to when a reply to the Parian/,
a note proposing the withdrawal
of the troops might he sent. Several
days may elapse before such a conitnu1
nication is completed. The Secretary
is known to have many details to con;
aider.
1 No Indication of Withdrawal.
r Apparently the immediate withdrawal
of the American forces in Mexico is
_ not contemplated. It is understood
that the success of the de facto Rovern"
nient in demonstrating its intention and
^ ability to hunt down Villa and his ban*
dits, iit event the American expedition
is recalled, would have weight with
President Wilson in reaching a decision
1 regarding the matter.
President Wilson had before him today
several long messages from (Jen.
Funston. They were presented to him
by Secretary of War Baker at a midnight
conference last night. The SecreItary's
visit at such a late hour attracted
considerable interest here, although
he declared afterward that no significance
could be attached to it.
j Explain Embargo Resolution.
"The ammunition used by Villa in
shooting up Columbus was secured
from the United States under permit of
the administration at a time when Villa
was basking in the sunshine of Mr.
Wilson's favor," said Representative
Rod en berg of Illinois today in a statement
issued in explanation of a resolution
introduced by him to effect an embargo
on all munitions shipments to
Mexico.
The resolution directs the President to
prohibit the export of arms and ammunitions
and war supplies of all sorts to
the present recognized de facto govern- .

Fear Peril to Americans.
EL PASO. Tex.. April 15.?Fear for
the safety of Americans and other foreigners
in Parral. in which city the little
cavalry force of 110 men, under
Maj. Frank Tompkins, was attacked
last Wednesday, was expressed here to
Ud.> .
Some of the Americans known to be
in that section of Mexico are G. C. Smith
and W. C. Palmer of the Parral and
Durango railway, Leslie Webb and B.
C. Robinson of the Elrayo Mining Company
and a Miss Dunning, a Methodist
missionary. Another woman missionary
understood to be associated with
Miss Dunning is also reported to be in
Parral. There are several French and
German subjects in that vicinity.
The Mexican censorship over the land
lines leading into Parral is strict and
the military authorities are sending all
information in code.
Property Reported Destroyed.
Representatives of mining companies
with large plants in and about Parral
are making frantic efforts to obtain
information regarding their plants,
for there are persistent reports that
following the attack on the American
cavalry last Wednesday mobs vented
their vengeance on American property
Admission was made today by an official
of the Alvarado Mining Company
that the mob had made a destructive
attack on its mill.
Official advices concerning Maj. iorupkins
and his cavalry column were
anxiously awaited today. The stor> of
the Parral affair is yet to be told, while
uncertainty envelopes the luither
march southward of Maj. Tompkins
forces, who are. now believed lo have
passed over the Dui ango-Chihuuhua
line.
Bays Peons iace Starvation.
Economic conditions in Mexico are
more menacing to the hopes of a restoration
of order and the avoidance
of serious friction between that country
and the United States, than any
political conditions, according to an
American who returned here today
from a tour whieh embraced most of
the territory north of Mexico City.
This man, who is identified with large
American interests in Mexico, brought
reports of the destruction by mobs ??f
the American plants and warehouses in
several places.
"These outbreaks." he said, "are in
my judgement far more economic than
political. The condition of the masses
of the people throughout northern
Mexico is terrible. Magnificent farm
lands, capable of raising almost any
crop in the world, have been lying
or rather exist, in misery. Plain starvation
faces thousands of them.
"The trouble is that they have been
sedulously tliught by agitators to believe
that all their woes are due to the
foreigners. They have never seen a
poor, ill-nourished American and the
traditional envy of the people for the
well-to-do has grown in their case to
a mania.
"They are. of course, extremely ignorant
and superstitious and the anfiCarranza
factions, who are many if divided.
consistently tell them that Car*
ranza is in the pay of the Americans,
who are going to seize all Mexico and
take what little they have left away
from them."
Border Alarm Continues.
The alarm along the border caused
by the request of Gen. Carranza for .
the withdrawal of the American troops
had far from subsided today. El
Paso is filled with refugees who have
interests in Mexico, ranging from.fortunes
to hopes.
These refugees are said generally to
favor intervention and Have been
greatly excited by reports that President
Wilson contemplated withdrawal
3f the expeditionary force. Stories of
he looting: and destruc tion of American
propei ty in Mexico and of hostilities
toward Americans by Mexicans are the
staple topic of conversation in thin
My and lose nothing: in the telling.
The only authentic information received
here from the interior comes in
a few stray messages in code, which
ire received by the representatives of
large mining and lumber concerns
which maintain headquarters here Up
to date these messages have reported

nobs, with incidental destruction of
