is,
ng Washington.-The governments ol
tLe the entente allies, through Sir Cecil
ke Spring Rice, the British ambassador,
has presented to Secretary Lansing a
joint reply to the protest made by
he the United States against the seizure,
it, detention and censorship of neutral
ad mails. It declared that no legitimate
letter mail had been confiscated nor
Id any treaty rights violated, but em
le phatically asserted the allies' Inten
tion to continue searching parcel post
Spackages for contraband "concealed
under postal folders."
e In regard to "true correspondence."
the note says the allied governments
t "will continue for the present to re
et rain from seizing and confecating at
sea these correspondences, letters and
dispatches, and that they will insure
the most rapid transition of them pos
sible as soon as the genuineness of
their character is known."
The vigorous protest of the United
States against the treatment of neu
t tral mails was based largely on evi
deance in the possession of the State
Department that while mails had not
= always been searched at sea, neutral
ships, upon being taken into British
d ports for Inspection, had their mails
removed, detained and otherwise In
P terfered with. The reply does not
s mention this phase of the controversy.
Thq protest was in the form of a
e memorandum of instructions to Am
I bassador Page at London. It stated
I specifically that the American govern
Sment was inclined to consider that
I parcel post shipments were subject to
the same treatment accorded goods
sent by freight or express.
In regard to parcel post shipments,
the communication says "merchandise
I shipped under the shape of parcel post
must not and shall not be treated dif
ferently from the merchandise shipped
in any other way."
