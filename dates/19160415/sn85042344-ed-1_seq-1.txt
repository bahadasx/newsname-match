Cases Agree to Sever Tac

SETTLEMENT IN CASH
Both Sides Made Conces
sions but Neither Side
Is Entirely Happy.
LONDON. April 14 (6:30 p. m.)
Final settlement was reached in
the Chicago meat packers cases today
when a check was handed to Chandler
P. Anderson, representing the Armour,
Swift, Hammond nnd Morris com
panies, and B. Lloyd Griseom, repre
senting the Schwarzschlld & Sulz
berger Co., for the amount agreed
upon yesterday. The sum was not
disclosed.
While the details have not been
divulged, it is known here that the
agreement finally hinged on guaran
tees that the meat shippers should do
no trading in the future with the
countries at war with Great Britain
and her allies, and that with this
settled under a cash bond, little dif
ficulty was experienced in reaching
a monetary sett lenient of the cases of
tho cargoes which had been sent to
tho prize court.
Discussing tho case with the Asso
ciated Press, Lord Itotiert Cecil, min
ister of war trade, said:
"I am not at liberty to give the de
tails of the agreement, but I can say
that guarantees were given that there
would be no future trading with the
-nemy. The representatives ot tho
packers express themselves as pleased
with the settlement, which means that
all the cases will lie withdrawn from
the prize court whila the Kim appeal
will not be proceeded with."
The prize court condemned the
meat cargo of the Norwegian steamer
Kim last September.
It Is known that both siJes made
considerable concessions from their
original stands. It is not believed
that the packers are entirely happy
over the guarantees they have been
compelled to give, while the govern
ment expects some criticism on ac
count of its concessions.

WASHINGTON, April 14. The
United States Is prepared to
treat with General Carranza an pro
posed In his note of yesterday for tho
withdrawal of American troops from
Mexico. Pending tho outcome of the
diplomatic negotiations, however, the
status of tho expedition will remain
unchanged and the pursuit of Villa
continue.
This was the situation ns officially
slated today after President Wilson
and his cabinet had considered the
new phases of the Mexican problem
raised by General Carranza's com
munication. Secretary Lansing said
he was prepared to take up the mat
ter with the de facto government but
would not indicate when a reply
might be sent. Secretary Baker said
no new orders had been sent to Gen
eral Funston and that none were
under contemplation.
Both secretaries said there had
been no change In the policy of the
administration which prompted the
pursuit or Ilia.
From other Bources It was learned
that the success of the Carranza gov
ernment in demonstrating its inten
tion and ability to continue the pur
suit and extermination of the bandits
should American forces be recalled,
would weigh heavily with President
Wilson In reaching a final decision.
In that connection an official report
from the commander of the American
forces attacked at Parral, Mexico, by
civilians is anxiously awaited. Gen
eral Carranza's information trans
mitted yesterday was that his soldiers

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, April 14.
The Americans on whom the
Mexicans at Parral fired were un
armed, according to an unconfirmed
version of tho Incident current in
Chihuahua and transmitted to Gen
eral Funston, today. According to this
story forty of the troopers entered
Parral presumably to purchase sup
plies und were fired upon. Two were
killed and the remainder retreated to
the main body of troops encamped
outside of the city.
The atacklng force pursued them
and were met by a fire from the
Americans who were using a machine
gun, killing forty Mexicans.
Accordnig to this story the attack
ing partv comprised Carranza soldiers
and civilians.
This report of the Parral incident
was sent from Chihuahua to General
Bell, at Kl Paso, who forwarded it
to General Funston. Full allowance
was given by departmental officers to

PARTY COMPOSED OF
OF MEXICAN CITIZENS
manifested a disposition to credit the
report.
Many of the officers at headquar
ters here regarded the story as more
probable than some of the versions
that have come out of Mexico, It was
pointed out that in previous cases
soldiers had entered towns for the
purpose of buying supplies anil had
been received in a friendly manner
by the residents, mid that If they had
gone Into I'arral for that purpose It
was probable that they went un

from tleneral Pershing of the oc
currence but late today no word from
him or any other officer In the puni

The last heard from General Pershing
was that he was moving south from
