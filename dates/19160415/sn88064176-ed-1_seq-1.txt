Be it known and remembered
that on this the 12th day of April,
1916, the Board of School Direc
tors of the parish of Grant, Lou

12 o'clock m., in accordance with
ordinance No. 8 of the Board of
School Directors of the parish of
Grant, enacted on the 1st day of
March, 1916, notice of which was
issued and published according
to law, the undersigned members
of the Board of School Directors I
of the parish of Grant, Louisiana,
being a quorum thereof, met in
special public session in the court
house in said parish, and accord
ing to law opened the ballot box
used in, and which was received
from the commissioners of the
election held on Tuesday, the 11th
day of April, 1916, in accordance
with said ordinance, and thereby
proceeded to count the ballots,
both in number and amount for
and against, to determine the
PROPOSITION
To incur debt and issue bonds
of the Montgomery School Dis
trict No. 21, in the parish of
Grant, Louisiana, to the amount
of ten thousand ($10,000.00) dol
lars to run for a period of sixteen
(16) years, bearing interest at
the rate of five per cent per an
num, payable annually, the funds
thus derived to be used for the
PURPOSE
of building and equipping a school
building at Montgomery, Louisi
ana, in Montgomery School Dis
trict No. 21, of said parish and
State, and for purchasing a school
site if such should be necessary.
The result of the said count
was twenty-eight (28) ballots,
and twentyweight thousand dol
lars ($28,000.00) in favor of said
proposition, and no ballots and
no dollars against said proposi
tioh, and, therefore, the majori
ty in both number and amount 1
cast by the property taxpayers
of the said Montgomery School
District No. 21, of Grant parish,
Louisiana, in the said election be
ing in favor thereof; and
At the same time and place we
- did examine and canvass the re
turns, as evidenced by the dupli
Scate tally sheets and duplicate
i- compiled statements, the correct
b ness of both being sworn to by
b the commissioners according to
Slaw, and finding also that the re
, turns indicated a majority both
e in number and amount of prop
[erty in favor of said proposition; I
Stherefore we declare that the re 1
otlt of the said election is in fa
war of t
PROPOSITION

the said school district No. 21 in
the parish of Grant, Louisiana,
to the amount of ten thousand

PURPOSE
of building and equipping a school
building at Montgomery, Louisi
ana, in Montgomery School Dis
trict No. 21, of said parish and

site if such should be necessary.
And, in accordance with law,
