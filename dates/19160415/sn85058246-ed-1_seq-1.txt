quested to Atk That Center
im, Street Be Parked
Tho National Park Highway com
mittee pf the Commercial Club was
prescnf at the regular monthly meet
ing of tho directors hold Wcdnosday,
April 12 to report and discuss mat
ters relative to tho Park routo. Mr.
C. M. Harris, chairman of tho com
mittee asked that the club appoint a
strong committee to Bollclt funds to
meet Logan's share of tho expenso
for advertising tho route this way.
It was decided that the Wnys and
Means committee be asked to do this
work.
Prof. William Peterson, a member
of tho committee and of the State
Highway Commission stated that tho
state would maintain the routo thru
Cache, that men would bo appointed
to look after overy three to five miles
of tho road and to drag and repair
such pieces of road at tho proper
tlmo. Ho asked that tho club mem
bers or any others who travel tho
roads, report to him or tho county
commissioners bad places, and whero
they aro not too serious and can ho
repaired with little effort, that tho
party at hand repair the place and
I send In his bill. Just as soon as tho
I weather conditions aro pcrmlssablc,
I tho road through Wellsvlllo canyon
I and to 'tho Idaho lino, will bo put In
I excellent condition.
I The peoTilo .In Franklin, Preston,
I Dayton and tho other towns In south-
I crn Idaho, aro working hard to got
I their part of tho highway In good
shape. They have government sur
I veyors at work and It Is tho Intention
to cut down tho steep grades from
H nrnotnn in Dnvtnn
It was tho sentiment of tho meet-
m Ing that Just as soon as tho highway
through tho valley Is mado passable
that It ho advertised wldety in nil
directions in order to draw tho tour
ists this way. The advertising com
tnltteo has a very thorough and ef
fective plan to advertise tho route.
It was decided that the matter
of having a Palnt-up and Cleanup
Week In Logan bo referred to the
Civic Improvement Committee with
power to act. It was suggested that
tho commltteo ask certain property
owners on Center street to park tholr
sidewalks. Also to ask the owner of
the property on the oast of South
Main by tho canaljtp placo nig prop
erty In better condition so that it
will harmonize with that of tho That
cher Milling C6., on the west of the
street.

one thing,
Tho board and standing committees

A NEW WORLD'S
RECORD MADE
The nutomobllo topic of the hour
In Salt Lako Tuesday has been the
telegraphic dispatches sent out last
nlglrt from Daytona, Florida, over
the wires of tho Associated PresB
and other news scrvlcesnnounclng
that Italph Mulford, tho 'noted rac
ing driver, established a, Mew world's
record for stork chassis automobiles
of tho 300 cubic Inch class'Monday on
the famous Ocean Beach speedway at
Daytona, driving at Hudson Super
Six. Mulford drovo the mile. In 35:12
seconds.
This means over 101 miles an hour.
It Is unquestionably one of tho
most remnrkablo nnd sensational
speed trials over mado In this coun
try or Europo with tho stock model
of an nutomobllo.
According to tho newspaper dls
potches received Tuesday from Day
tona tho tlmo and speed trial mado
by Mulford was sanctioned and ob
served by tho American Automobile
Association, F. E. Edwards and F.
J. Wagner being in chnrgo.
Mulford mado six trials on tho
bench nt Daytona, Monday nnd each
tlmo drovo tho mllo under 38 sec
onds. A speed of 101 rallos an hour Is
considered, of course, n terrific paco
for oven a specially constructed rac
ing car, while It forms all, tho more
a sensation by being accomplished
with Hudson Super SW taken from
stock.
Tho news of Mulford's achievement
with tho Supor-SIx yesterday at
Daytona camo as a complotc surprise
to local automobile circles, Including
Frank Dotterlll of tho Tom llottorlll
Automobllo Company, distributors In
this section for tho Hudson Super
Six.
Mr. Dotterlll received a wlro from
tho Hudson factory several' days Ago
stating that high officials of'the-Hud-son
company wero at Daytona with
Mulford nnd that some sensational
speed records would likely be mado
In tho near future. Mr. Dotterlll
had no Idea, however, thnt bo sensa
tional a surprlso was being planned
as Mulford's record of a mllo In 3G:12
seconds.
"I am delighted, of course, but It
Isn't any more than I havo expected
of tho Super Six right along," de
clared Mr. Botterlll when seen thU
morning.
"It must be romembored that the
Super Six established some very won
derful records sovernl months ago on
tho Shcepshead bay speedway. Tho
acceleration record of tho Hudson
Super Six Is from nothing to sixty
miles per hour In 23 seconds. Tho
wonderful Super Six patented motor
Is of courso Iho secret of the car's
success and hero, in Salt Lake wo aro
experiencing some very remarkable
performances l with tho Super Sixes
now coming Jhrough for delivery to
customers. Shipments aro arriving
much moro frequently and thoro is
every indication that tho Hudson fac
tory Is rapidly catching up with Its
orders."
