Chapter 14.
As recounted In our last chapter,
we left boisterous Butte", the great
mining city, for the' beautiful little
city of Billings, which Is character
ized by Its Inhabitants as "the peer
leas princess of the plains," and Is In
deed one of the most beautiful towns
we visited on our tour. At Logan
we had the pleasure of meeting Royal
Grand Matron Haley of St. Louis, en
route to tho same city, and wo were
met at the station upon arriving there
about 7i30 p. m. by a large delegation
of the Masonic family. The' Royal
Grand Matron was taken to the home
of Mr. and Mrs. McCave and tho Grand
Secretary and myself escorted to the
leading hotel of tno city, where we
were very kindly received by the man
ager and Immediately became the cyn
osure of all eyes of the guests seated
In the lobby. After wo were shown
to our rooms we received a call from
the manager that on account of some
prejudice existing In the city It would
be necessary to serve us our meals
In our rooms, which was Immediately
Tcsented by both the Grand Secre
tary and myself, but we decided to
remain there over night, and the next
morning we called the Worshipful
Master of the lodge, Brother Emanuel
' Reed, whoso -ortrolt, oy tne way, ap
pears in the official proceedings of
the past year, and Insisted that quar
ters be secured for us among our own
people, and ho very graciously Invit
ed us to become his guests, which we
accepted. ,
Y'e drove out to his home for break-
, fast where we were served a magnifi
cent repast by his charming wife. We
also had the pleasure of having at
breakfast the Rev. Robert House and
wife, who ere doing a magnificent
work In tb.Is splendid cltjv He is one

It has made wonderful progress. Wo
also- met hero Robert Harris of R. T,
Coles lodge "So. 80, for whom the
lodges did so much in 1015. In the
afternoon in company with tho Grand
Secretary, who is also Grand Patron,
and tho Grand Matron we visited the
chapter, composed of representative
women of the city, and spent a very
pleasant hour and at night attended
a full dress reception given In honor
of tho visiting grand officers, which
was vone of the most pretentious af
fairs we had attended during our term
as Grand Master.
The Grand Matron delivered a mag
nificent address and after remarks by
the Grand Secretary and the writer a
delightful banquet was served at
which more than 200 plates were laid.
The next morning bright and early
Brother Davis and his automobile were
at our residence to carry us to the
station, and on Saturday morning we
left for Denver, 716 miles away, where
we arrived .about 8:30 Sunday morn
ing. After securing hotel accofmoda
tlons and removing the stains of trav
el, we went out to Shorter chapel,
expecting to hear Rev. Henry M. Col
lins of Tacoma, Wash., a former Kan
sas Cityan, who was announced to
preach, but we were disappointed, as
his trajn was late and he failed to
reach the citp on time. But we heard
a very Interesting sermOn by the pas-,
to?, Dr. R. L. Pope, who leads his con
ference delegation to the general con
ference. We also met Rev. A. M.
Ward, presiding elder, and his charm
ing wife, who was formerly secretary
of the Yates Y. W. G A. of Kansas
City, Kas. Upon their Insistence we
were compelled to make some remarks
to tho large congregation, which were
apparently well received.
Herer we met many old friends.
Among them Grand Master Titus Rec
tor, Grand Secretary Wm. Sprague,
Past Grand .Master F.. T. Bruce, Mr.
and Mrs. Jesse Thrower, who aro very
prominent In Denver society; Mrs.
Byrd, wldow'of Rev. Samuel W. Byrcf,
who pastored in Missouri many years
ago; our old school mate, Charles
Clark, formerly of Chllllcothe, Mo.:
and many others whom space will not
permit me tp mention.
Wo Intended to visit tho Masonic
services to be held that night at the
same church, but the Grand Secretary
suddenly developed a determined and
violent mania for going home, and
upon his vehement insistence we can
celed our engagement, boarded the
Rock Island and started for tho dear
est of all places home, sweet home
where we arrived just five weeks and
one day from tho date of our depar
ture, and were royally welcomed home
by our dear little wife and many
friends, whom wo have tried to regale
In these various chapters with a brief
account of our experiences during our
most enjoyable and ever to be remem
bered trip. Wo shall ever cherish In
grateful memory tho many courtesies
and kindnesses shbwn us by our

CARE OF THE BABY.
Birth Registration.
Has the birth of your baby been
registered? If not, you should see to
It that this duty Is performed without
delay. It may some time be of the
greatest Importance to your child that
there be in existence an accurate legal
record of his birth, date, place and
parentage. Such a record serves to
establish his ago beyond question, and
through this his right to the legal pe
riod of schooling and freedom from la
bor. It may also serve to establish his
right to a disputed inheritance and
to establish for him various property
or other legal rights which may be in
dispute. There are numerous instances
where the lack of this sort of record
has been the cause of serious losses
of inheritance and of educational and
other rights.
It is, in most states, required by law
that tho doctor, midwife or other at
tendant at birth shall report the birth
to tbe registrar of births, but as this
duty Is not Infrequently neglected par
ents should investigate to see-whether
It has been done properly In the
case of their, children.
The complete registering of all
births is indispensable, not only to the
individual, but to the state and the na
tion. The federal government can and
does tell us exactly how great is the
accession to onr population each year
by Immigration, or intake from for
eign lands. At each port of landing
immigration Inspectors record each ar
rival and tell us his or her nationality,
age, sox, destination and how much
money each one brings. But the fed
eral government can not go into the
states and cities and establish regis
tration offices and tell us how many
children enter each state by birth,
separately. Wo have no national book
keeping to account for tho ebb and
flow of human llto as an asset and
a liability of our civic organism. We
have no national records to give our
sanitarians and students a basis tor
their preventive studies. Congress by
resolution has urged tho states to en
act and entorco sultablo registration
legislation. The state governments
must now act.
Injustice to the Negro Press.
An Open Letter to Negro Merchants
Business League Talk No. 4.
As one reads the Negro newspapers
from week to week they can not but
feel that as a clas3 the Negro editors
are Just about as unselfish as any set
of people in the country. They are,
in fact, the ultra exponents of unsel
fishness. No less than a dozen of these pa
pers take their turn each week and
speak editorially to the race, urging
them to patronize the members of the
race who aro In business. That ap
pears to bo ono topic on which all
tho publishers agree, and in agitating
for more liberal and sustained pat
ronage for Negro business enterprises
they are prompted by no loftier mo
tive than their pride of race and their
absorbing desire for tho race's upcllmb
into tho more Important avenues of
commerce and Industry. For this
they are to be commended and should
be encouraged.
By continually urging tho raco to
support its business men, these pa
pers are extending the trade of the
Negro business men. But what are
the Negro merchants as a group giv
ing back to the Negro papers in re
turn, and what are they doing to co
operate with all this agitation?
It must be granted that quite a few
individual merchants give their print
ing of stationery to colored printers
and not a few insert small advertise
ments In Negro newspapers which in
many instances is "traded out," but
there is entire absence of group ap
preciation on the part of Negro mer
chants for the greit work now being
done for them by the Negro editors.
Here are some questions which sug
gest themselves as we read the Ne
gro papers and see how earnestly they
are pulling for the Negro business
men:
Why do the colored merchants not
speak up for themselves?
Why do they continue to let the
Negro newspapers pay their advertis
ing bills?
Why are they content with the busi
ness which "drifts in?"
Why do they not combine and go
after the race's business in a big way?
The business is certainly there for
the asking. The race is spending now
about $600,000,000 a year for food and
only about a fourth of this is going to
colored merchants r the race is spend
ing $50,000,000 a year for shoes, and
only about one-twentieth of this is
going to Negro dealers. There is but

one way to get this business, and that
is to go after it in a definite and de
termined way.
The burden of educating and culti
vating this trade rests with the busi
ness men themselves, and should not
be left to the colored papers. They
have their hands quite full in getting
our young folks educated and in pro
tecting our rights.
To accomplish something that would
really Justify the effort, the merchants
must of courso realize tho situation
as it Is and then determine to work
out a plan which will accomplish the
desired results. First, have a com
mon understanding on the question of
service. White merchants aro their
chief competitors, and no step to
wards securing bigger Negro trade
can be mado without studying tho
methods of competitors in order to
meet them with methods equally as
effective. Service has been one of
tho important contributing factors to
the success of white business enter
prises and service is 50 per cent of
any selling plan.

Colored men In this country, died at
his residence, 1831 Paseo, of paralysis

Lucas was born in Pennsylvania and

he has since lived. He retired from
business two years ago on account of
ill health, having conducted for many
years one of the largest and most
handsomely equipped barber shops in
this country, and had as his patrons
the most aristocratic and wealthiest
white people in Kansas City. He was
married to Miss Amanda Jackson in
1869, who survives him, also three
children are living: Mrs. Hattie Rich
ardson, Mrs. Mable Moseley and Dan
iel Lucas, Jr. He was a 33d degree
