LIVE YOUR LIFE
When a man dies before his time, we
all say, "IT'S TOO BAD" yet many
people, while sorrowing for their friend
neglect the little ailments that mean
an early death to themselves. The old
old story about an ounce of prevention
is as true today as ever. Catarrh now
may mean consumption later on; Piles
and Ulceration may mean cancer in a
few years; a slight Kindey trouble may
terminate in Brights Disease. The
man who goes to a Specialist today
may get well with a little treatment,
and the man who puts off until he is in
the late stages may never be well. To
which class do you belong? Are you a
procrastinator? Or do you belong to
the class who say "DO IT NOW."
Your life may depend on it. '

from Rev. Rogers, of the Baptist
church representing the other churches.
Mr. and Mrs. Malloy.whose voices blend
beautifully in duet, sang a number. Dr.
Lewis, in his own orignial way, made a
speech of welcome, to which Rev. and
Mrs. Hale responded . Then all went
down to the parlors and spent and hour

partaking of the delicious refresh

"Although I realize that it is quite
ambitious," sal Henry Edward Mal
loy, the director of the department of
music of the Fort Hays Kansas Normal
School, "to attempt to bring an or
chestra of eighty-five players and four
soloists to Haj-s, but I feel certain that
the desire for better music is growing
in Western Kansas. We brought Gus
taf Holmquist, the famous Chicago
basso, to Hays and had to sell standing
room for $1.00. The Philharmonic Or
chestra is the biggest thing the music
department has ever attempted here."
Where, in the near past roamed buf
faloes, coyotes, and Indians, now are
being sung oratorios, grand opera, and
the New York Philharmonic Orchestra
plays.
The train carrying the Orchestra is a
veritable treasure train. The violin of
Pilzer, the first violinist, is a Francesco
Gobetti, built in 1710 and valued at
$5000, the kettle drum cost $700,
Schulz's 'cello $3,000. Kovarik's viola
$2,500. and the harp $2,000.
During the seventy-four years of the
Philharmonic Orchestra it has postponed
only one concert. That was in April,
1865, when it postponed a concert out
of respect to President Lincoln who
was assassinated during that month.
This is the only time in its history that
a concert has been postponed.
Special trains will be run into Hays
under the direction of the Normal
School to accomodate the out of town
music lovers and arrangements are al
ready being made for private homes in
Hays to take care of the overflow from
the hotels.
