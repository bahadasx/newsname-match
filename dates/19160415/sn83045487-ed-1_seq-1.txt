ADAMS EXPRESS CO.
OFFICIAL REPROVED
Discharge of Boy Who Was Robbed Called "Damnable"
by Judge Fisher Company Rules Refuse
Another Chance.
The methods of a big corporation
in its dealings with its employes
were characterized as damnable this
morning by Harry M. Fisher, judge
of the boys' court, in an excoriation
of the Adams Express Co. for its ac
tion in discharging Edward Thomp
son, a driver, and practically depriv
ing him of a chance to get further
employment, after Thompson had
done everything in his power to help
the express company capture and
convict a thief.
On April 1 Thompson, received two.
packages of money from the Adams
Express office, at 2123 W. Madison
st, and, pursuant to his custom, he
put them both under the seat of the
wagon.
One of the packages he delivered
that morning, but had not delivered
the other before noon, so he left it
under the seat in his wagon in the
Adams Express livery stable while he
ate his dinner. Later in the after
noon, when he attempted to deliver
jthe package he found it had been
stolen. .
