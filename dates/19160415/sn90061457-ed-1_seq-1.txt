THESE ARE THE DAYSTHAT SEARCH
THE HEARTS QFMEN, SAYS WILSON
In a Stirring Address Delivered Before
Democrats From All Parts of the
Country He Gives His Views
He Asks if the People Would Go in
For Humanity and is Met With
A Prompt Response
Washington, April 13. President
Wilson, speaking at r Jefferson Day
banquet of Democrats from all parts
of the country here tonight, prayed
-that the United States would not be
.orawu Into a quarrel not of Itc own
r.
choosing. But he asked If the people
l i f"wcre willing to go in where the in -
; ffc'terestB of America were coincident
V tywith the Interests of humanity and
' have the courage to withdraw when
the interests of humanity had been
conserved. He was Interrupted by
cheers and shouts of "Yes!"
In his address the president had
mentioned the European war and the
Mexican question, without intimating
what were his plans in either of the
problems confronting the United
States.
Responsibility With Democrats
He declared that In the present sit
uation the responsibility was with the
Democratic party, because that party

PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON
controls the government, and ibat "It
Is for us" to hold the balance even and
not to allow some malign Influence to
depress one side or the other.
Most of the speech was devoted to
reviewing the achievements of the
Democratic party In the last three
years, and to a criticism of the Ite-
publicans as the party with "a provin
cial spirit." The president asserted
that the nation was better prepared
that ever before to show how America
can lead along the pathway of light.
Pleads for Nonpartisan Service
The president declared that he was
not interested In personal ambition
nor even enthusiastic over party suc
cess, but that he was Interested In see
ing the load depressing humanity lift
ed. He mentioned none of the Repub
llcan leaders by name, but when he
spoke of ambitious men there were
shouts of "T. B."
What the nation demands now, the
president said, Is servlco essentially
nonpartisan, not only In consideration
jvot foreign nffairs, but In domestic af
fairs as well.
Referred to Mexico
Referring incidentally to Mexico, he
told of how a man had urged that trus
tees for that nation's welfare be chos
en, and of his reply that no nation
had achieved real prosperity and hap
piness for Its masses through trustee
ship imposed on it.
It was the first speech of a political
nature the president had made for
several months, and was delivered be
foie an audience including nearly all
'the members of his cabinet. Demo
cratic members of the Senate and
House, Democratic chairmen from
many states and other high officials
1 of the nation and states gathered to
' attend the annual banquet of the Com-
mon Counsel club. Mrs. Wilson and
the wives of the cabinet officers oc
cupied n box during the speaking.
On the Use of Power
Excerpts from the president's ad
dress follow:
"I was talking one day with a gen
tleman who was expounding to me the
very familiar Idea that somebody I
dare say he would have preferred to
name the persons should act as guar
dians and trustees for the people of
the neighboring republic of Mexico. I
said 'I defy you to show a single ex
ample In history in which liberty and
prosperity were ever handed down
from above. Prosperity for the great
masses of mankind has never sprung
out of the soil of privilege. Prosper
lty for the great masses of mankind
has never been created by the benefl
cence of privilege.
"Wherever we use our power we
must use it with this conception a!
ways in mind, that we are using It for
the benefit of the persons who are
chiefly Interested and not for our own
benefit.
"Frankly, gentlemen, I am not In
terested In personal ambitions. May I
not admit even In this company that
I am not enthusiastic over mere party
success? This country demands serv
ice which Is essentially and funda
mentally nonpartisan.
"Any man who fights for any class
In this country Is now fighting against
the Interest of America and the wel
fare of the world.
"If We Should Be Drawn In"
"Gentlemen, are you ready for the
test? God forbid that we should ever
become directly or Indirectly em
broiled in quarrels not of our own
choosing and that do not affect what
we feel responsible to defend, but if
we should ever be drawn In, are you
ready to go In only where the Interests
of America are coincident with the
Interests of mankind and to draw out
the moment the Interest centers In
America and Is narrowed from the
wide elide of humanlty7 Have youj
the courage to go In? Have you the
courage to come cut, accoruing as q
the balance Is disturbed or readjusted
for the Interests of humanity?
"These arc days that search men's
hearts. These are days that discredit
selfish speech. These are days that
ought to (julet 111 considered counsel.
These are solemn days, when all the
moral standards of mankind are about
to be finally tried out."

And It Will Cure That "Spring Epl

Theie are thousands of cases ofi
"spring epidemic" now rampant In St.'
Joseph the are also two kinds of
the so-called malady, and we are prob-j
jtfly the only living doctor who has .1
free cure that will fit both sorts. Now
take notice:
One of the epidemics Is physical.!
You've been housed un nreltv much
all the time during the winter and
your leucocytes are sluggish. There
are liver specks In your eyes and
your flesh feels flabby on your frame.
Your general mien may be diagnosed
as profound laziness.

and mental. You have been playing1' "mn ",s "'" Peuestai mrougn

I To the Editor of The Observer:
in the News-Press, the Republl-
can organ, a few days ago, there
appeared the announcement that
Mayor Marshall had decided to
appoint John Brendel a member
of the board Of public works.
No doubt you will, as will also
your many readers, remember
during the late city campaign,
that Mr Rellly, the Democratic
candidate for ma or, accused this
man Biendel with having made a
deal 'th Marshall for this ap-
polntment, and Brendel stated
publicly It was false that he
"would not accept a nomination
n the ticket," neither would he
"De n party to an appointment un-

HOUSE PASSES BILL
The River and Harbor Bill, Which
Carries the St. Joseph Appropria
tion, Goes Through
The river and harbor bill, which
means so much for St. Joseph on ac-
count of the fact that it carries with
it Congressman Charles F. Booher'a
provision giving $75,000 to be expend-
ed on river improvement work oppo-
site Lake Contrary, provided that
thote interested raise an amount equal
to that appropriated, was on last
Tuesday passed by the House with the
Booher provision intact. It Is now up
to the Senate, which is expected to
dispose of the matter in a short time
From Present indications there 13 no
question but that the St. Joseph ap-
propriation will pass the Senate and
become available. Senator Stone and
Senator Beed are both favorable to
tlle appropriation,
It Is now up to the people of St.
Joseph, and others Interested, to get
to work and raise the amount neces
sary to comply with the bill as pushul

Booher. There has been conslderabla
cutting at the Lake Contrary bend
in the past few days, and the preent

is expected to do damage. It would
be a great misfortune for this com

nanclal prosperity and strength is

"Total deposits, $10,790,000,000, an

Increase Greater Than All Deposits I
"As recently as 1896, the statement
says, the entire amount on deposit In
national banks within the United
States was less than the Increase in
deposits within the past twelve'
months.
"Total reserves held by national
banks, March 7, were $2,287,000,000,1
This Is $993,000,000 more than the law
requires and Is more than $100,000,000
In excess of the greatest surplus re

"It is conservatively estimated,
sajs the comptroller's statement,
that the surplus reserve now held by
the national banks would be sufficient
to give a further loaning power of $3,

made to other foreign powers, amount

greater or less degree, have partici
pated in. there are no Indications of un
sound inflation or excessive loans and
the national banks of the country have
never been In a stronger position than
thej are at this time."
These are certainly some Demo-
, cratic times and they are under the
influence of President Wilson and the
Democratic policy and party.
