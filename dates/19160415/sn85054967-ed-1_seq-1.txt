the Outcome.
LANSING- DOESN'T TALK
WASHINGTON, Aprii 14.
Gen. Carranzn, by a note which
arrived at his emt)assy here to
day for to Secre
tary Lansing, asks for the with
drawal of American troops from
Mexico.
Eliseo Arredondo, Gen. Car
ranza's ambassador, expects to
present the note at the State De
partment today.
It raises a new issue in a sit
uation already much complexed,
the outcome of which officials
are reticent to predict until they
have gone over the communica
tion carefully and considered
what reply ohe United States
will make.
In officiai qnarters it was stat
ed that the American troops will
not be withdrawn, at this time
at least, and that while the
question is bc ing discussed with
Gen. Carranza, the pursuit of
the Villa bandits would be rush
ed with renewed vigor.
Secretary ì >ansing had not
received Gen. Carranza's note
and declined to say what the de
partment's policy toward it
would be.

United States
Aviators Made
a Fine Flight
Break Army Record in Trip
from General Pershing's
Near Parrai.
WASHINGTON, Afcril 14.
Ali previous records for sustain
ed flight in the army aviation
service were broken today when,
according to a despatch receiv
ed at the War from
Gen. Funston, an army biplane,
carrying Lieuts. Edgar S. Gor
rell and Herbert A. Dargue, ar
rived at Columbus, N. M., after
a 350 mile flight in four hours
from Gen. Pershing's headquart
ers in Mexico.
The best previous cross-coun
try flight for the army sei-vice
was made by Capt. Dodd of the
Signal Corps, who flew approxi
mately 260 miles from the army
aviation school at San Diego,
Cai. Before that the record was
held by Lieut. Milling, who flew
from Galveston to San Antonio,
a distance of 220 miles, without
alighting.
Both Capt. Dodd and Lieut.
Milling are with the first Aero
squadron in Mexico. Lieut. Gor
rell was one of the aviators who
was lost for a time in the flight
of the squadron from Columbus
to Casas Grandes when the army
first entered Mexico. Ali four
men are regarded as experts
fliers.
When the news of the flight
was given to Brig.-Gen. Scriven,
chief of the Signal Corps of the
army, over the telephone to
night he said:
"I trust that this achievement
ing condiions due
madc under the most adverse
flying conditions due to the alti
tude at which it had to be made,
will serve somewhat to correct
the unfair impression created
throughout the country by the
newspapers' accounts of the
shortcomings of the army fliers
in Mexico."
Gen. Funston stated that the
aviators brought no message
from Gen. Pershing regarding
the progress of the expedition
after Villa. The distance of the
flight is significante in indicat
ing that Gen. Pershing himself
is in the vicinity of Parai, at the
southern extremity of the State
of Chihuahua, and that the ad
vance columns are well across
the line into Durango. Officials
of the State Department under
stand that the vanguard of the
expedition is now about 400
miles from the border.
