[[WASHINGTON, April 15.—Recom
endatlons from General Funston,

fodiers and civilians and the fourth

J'u&ston's previous request for
Jiifting his base from Columbus.
Undoubtedly it bore on orders gtr

Its nature.
In the meantime, anxiety began to

Secretary Lansing's willingness to
reat with Mexican Ambassador Ar
hindondo over withdrawal of Ameri
can troops as urgently sought by Gen
eral Carranza, may mean the opening
of preliminary negotiations today or
|the first of next week. While some
administration men said there had
been no change of policy toward Mex
ico and that none was in sight, others
believed the "treating" will mean
Iheeding Carranza's request. The feel
ling appeared to grow that it is futile

regime sought to limit strictly the

army, operating under a reciprocity
arrangement was to consist of 1,000
cavalrymen only, towns were not to
be occupied and the forces were to
withdraw when their object was ac

countered these proposals with no

Rioting at Parral.
[By E. T. Conkle, United Press Staff

EL. PAiSO, Texas, April 16.—Rioting
in which property was destroyed,
followed the clash between American
troops and the residents of Parrall,
according to advices received by A. J.
Mchatters, of Boston, president of
the Alvarado Mining and Milling
company of Parral. Carranza Consul
Garcia, quoting a telegram from War
Minister Obregon, denied there was
rioting and stated that the situation
quieted down after the fight.

Anxious for Reports.
SAN ANTONIO, Texas, April 15.—
Despite the receipt of Consul Letch
ler's unconfirmed version of the fight
ing at Parral, Major General Funston
land officers of his staff today were
badly worried over the lack of official
advices from General Pershing telling
1
how the American detachment fared.
'The "Letcher report was regarded as
reassuring, despite the unofficial na
Iture of the advices quoted by the
I consul, principally because it de
clared the American soldiers were un
armed when they entered Parral.
Officers at headquarters were in
clined to accept the account as more
nearly correct than any other detailed
but unconfirmed versions which have
come out of Mexioo. Still there was
serious concern at headquarters over
Pprshing's silence. The report should
have been received early yesterday,
to lift the doubt beclouding the fate
of the American detachment. Gen
eral Pershing was last heard from as
he was moving southward from
Satevo.
General Funston sent a message

Considerable party politics over

Keenly aware that the president's

'Sn the Italian front, artillery
duels continued to such an extent as

losses. Our artillery vigorously shell

Hontebba.

WASHINGTON. April 15.—The final
touches are being put on this gov
ernment's communication to Germany
today. The affidavits forwarded here
by American consular agents at
Paris and London reached the state
department last night and early to
day Secretary Lansing was hard at
work going over thom.
Most of the evidence contained in
the affidavits had already been sent
to the state department in summar
ized form. The affidavits themselves
will be used as "exhibits."
Additional information tending to
support that already in the presi
dent's hands on the Sussex and other
recent boat attacks, is being drawn
up by Secretary Lansing for incor
poration in the president's statement
to, Berlin.
If the secretary completes his work
on the affidavits today, he will con
fer with the president before night.
The president's conference with mem
bers of the house and senate foreign
relations committee will be held im
mediately after he has gone over the
communication for the last time with
Lansing.
Senator Stone, chairman of the
senate committee, suggested to Sec
retary Lansing today that it would be
well to have republican as well as
democratic members of the committee
in the proposed conference. Lansing
agreed. Final plans were not de
cided, however.
There is every indication that the
president's statement will be on its
way to Berlin not later than Mon
day.
In the meantime, the president has
held the lid down tight. All news
regarding details of the forthcoming
note, aside from the general trend of
this government's position, is closely
guarded. That it will be decisive and
will permit of only strong and imme
diate proof by Germany of her de
sire to conduct herself in such a man
ner as will bring about no further
diplomatic crisis, is believed certain.

Most Important Communication.
[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, April 15.—With,
what is said to be the most impor
tant communication this country has
ever dispatched to Germany, prac
tically drafted, President Wilson and
Secretary of State Lansing today
scanned additional evidence support-'
ing the United States' position in the!
case of the channel packet Sussex.
This evidence, in the form of affida-'
vits brought on the liner St. Paul
yesterday, is held to convict Germany
of having without any justification
torpedoed the Sussex with Americans
aboard.
A conference during tne day had
been arranged with Chairman Flood
of the house committee. It was the
purpose at this conference to lay be
fore the congressional leaders the
ground on which action is being tak
en and to (liscups possible eventuali
ties. Whether or not the whole mat
ter should be laid before congress
was also to be discussed. The presi
dent was not expected to put the mat
ter before congress in any event with
the idea of obtaining authorization
for the course to be pursued. Rather,
he was to announce the steps being
taken out of respect for the right of
congress to know.
