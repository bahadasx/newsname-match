Antonio. April 1 5. Much im
patience and some uneasiness were
maniff sted at (leneral Punston's head
qua rters today over General Per
shing's unbroken silence concerning
the fi:ht between American troops and
Mexicans at Parral Wednesday night.

Funstefl last night directed to Oeneral
Perr-hing a com mu nication sharply
BTCiaf him to expedite a report on the
Parral incident and on operations In
peneral.
The last official knowledge here of
o'ti oral Pershing's movement was
that he was expected to arrive at Sa
tevo, approximately ninety miles
northwest of Parral. Tuesday night.
General Funston received from the
war department today a rather long
communication but he refused to dis
cuss its character. There was reason
to believe the substance of his late re
ports t. Washington dealt largely with
the positions and activities of Car
lanza troops in northern Mexico and
the failure of them and other Car
ranza iuth jrities to co-operate mort
. tP i : ively with the Americans in the
pursuit of Villa.

Greater Force Than I', s.
The number of Carranza troops in
northern and central Mexico is far
urt at'-r than of the United States force
in Mexico, hut officers here pointed
out Villa had no apparent difficulty
in passing through t heir lines when
prCMMtd forward by the Americans.
It is b lievf d that General Funstnn
sis., called the attention of the war
department to his inability to protect
more adequately the detached forces
nt the front without materially weak
ening t he border patrol or using the
n llroadfl for troop movements.
General Fti nst on explained that he
had not the authority to bring addi
tion:! 1 troop! into his territory ; that
he had noi the authority to substitute
with militia and thai he did not regard
the present instructions as authorizing
him to use the railroads.
This mmm the sixth day since Gen
eral Peretrina has made a direct report
to hen dipia ri ers. General Pershing's
chief of staff. Lieut. Colonel Cabell, is
now at 'asas Grandes, where he went
to supervise the work ordered by Gen

Reports indicated that General
Arnulfo Gomez's troops are still in the
Bavtape valley, are being provisioned
for field work.
The three new companies of motor
trucks have arrived at Columbus, pro
viding i he ipia rtermaster's department
with t he full ten companies. 270
trucks. The chief difficulty now en
countered in getting forward supplies
is the bad condition of the roads.
Army officers report that the adobe
soil will be in such condition after the
first heavy rain that the operations of
the heavy trucks will be rendered al
most impossible.

New York. April 15. American
women soldiers will wear trou
sers as part of their uniform if
they follow example set by the 200
members of the American Wom
en's League for self defense.
These women have been attend
ing weekly drills here throughout
the winter.
The style of uniform came up
for vote last night and was the
cause of an animated discussion
in which Mrs. .1 Hungerford Mil
bank, head of the organization,
asserted that suits worn by the
women need not necessarily be
uniform. She objected to trou
sers on ihe ground that such a
uniform would be opposed by
husbands.
Others denounced dresses as a
"curse and burden' and urged
the women soldiers to get rid of
them- "When your husbands go
to the front." said one speaker,
"you will have to guard your
home against marauders. It will
be a man's work and you cannot
do it in dresses."

Stansfield and Trust Company
Would Give Corner.
Two Top floors for Business
Men's Headquarters.
A $1 90.000 building project was
launched at a meeting of the board of
directors of the Commercial club this
noon. It includes the acquisition of
the George W. Stansfield property at
632 Kansas avenue and the Prudential
Trust company's property at 634 Kan
sas avenue, corner of Seventh street
and Kansas avenue.
Then both buildings would be torn
down and a five story structure erect
ed. The first tloor of the new building
would be occupied by the Stansfield
drug store and the Farmers National
bank, two other stories would be used
for office rooms and the fourth and
fifth floors would be pressed into ser
vice as a Civic center for Topeka with
Commercial club headquarters on the
top floor and banquet and meeting
rooms for clubs and organizations on
the fourth floor.
Willing to Sell.
George W. Stansfield was present at
tvie meeting and offered to sell his
25x150 foot building for $35,000. He
further gave assurance to the board
of directors that the Prudential Trust
company is willing to sell for $55,000.
This makes a total of $90,000 and a
building such as would be desired for
Topeka probably will cost $100,000.
Tt was pointed out that with such a
building, office rooms could 6e rented
at all times as well as store rooms on
the first floor and those subscribing
to the proposed Commercial club stock
company would obtain interest on
their investment. Interest cannot be
promised in the purchase of the Elks'
club building1.

The proposition was placed in the
hands of the building committee which
was instructed to analyze it from ev
ery angle and turn in a report on the
IK8Sible rentals, eost of erection, the
return of the investment and other
matters of concern to citizens who
might Invest in the project.

PLAN READY FOR
NEW TEN STORY
OFFICE BUILDING
Knights & Ladies Structure at
Seventh and Kansas Avenue
To Be Built This Year at a Cost
of $275,000.
THE FIRST FLOOR FOR STORES
Upper Stories National Lodge
Quarters and Offices.
One of the Finest Office Build
ings in Kansas, Is Promise.
Plans and specifications for the new
ten-story, fire-proof office building of
the Knights and Ladies of Security
were today made public by W. B.
Kirkpa trick, president of the society.
The new building will be the home of
the national offices of the order and
will be built on the present site of Se
curity hall at Seventh and Kansas ave
nue. The building will cost $275,000
and will be built this year.
As soon as plans are approved by
the national council of the Knights
& Ladies of Security at their meeting
in Detroit, arrangements will be made
for letting contracts. There is little
doubt in the mind of President Kirk
patrick but that the new building will
be constructed as soon as possible.
Work will probably start next fall. The
plans will be submitted to the national
council in June.
Upper Floors Offices.
The new home of the Knights and
Ladies of Security will he ten stories
above basement the entire width and
depth of the building proper. The
building will be 50x150 feet and will
be finished in Bedford stone, trimmed
with terra cotta. The first floor of the
building will be used for stores, while
upper floors will be divided into of
fices. It is probable, it was asserted
today, that several floors of the build
ing might be let for department store
purposes. That arrangement would
probably require a change in the orig
inal plans.
At least two possibly three floors
will be held exclusively by the Security
lodge and will be used for national of
fices of the order. A large lodge room
and banquet hall is also provided In
the plans announced today by the na
tional president of the society. Krec
tion of the new building in the center
of the down town shopping district will
create a demand for space in the
building that will make the project
immediately profitable, Kirkpatrick
believes.
F1 reproof and Modern.
"The new building will be the very
latest thing in architecture and will be
fire-proof and modern in every re
spect." said Kirkpatrick. "I am cer
tain the project will carry. It must, of
course, be approved by the national
council, but I see no reason why the
matter will not meet general endorse
ment." Plans for the new structure were
drawn by N P. Xeilscn. architect. He
estimates cost of construction at
$275,000. A reproduction of the arch
itect's drawings are printed in today's
State Journal. A copy of the draw
ings are also displayed today In the
ing is also displayed today in the
curity building.
MIDNIGHT COUNCIL
White House Conference Fol
lows Funston Message.
Strict Secrecy Prevails; May
Move Border- Supply Base.
Washington. April 15. Recommen-I
dations from General Funston which, I
if adopted, may radically alter the
Villa hunt, were understood to be it: j
the hands of President Wilson and j
Secretarv of War Baker today.
They were contained in a long code I
message, the subject of a midnight I
conferenec at the hite House. The
Funston message did not give news of I
the Parral fight between soldiers and!
civilians and the fourth day since the I
fight occurred was entered without
word from the front.
Speculation as to the contents of !
Funston's dispatch ranged from re- j
quests for more troops to having the '
use of the Mexican lines in transport
ing supplies and reiteration of Fun- ,
ston's previous request for shifting his
base from Columbus.
Anxiety Over Pershing.
Undoubtedly it bore no orders giv- i
ing him directions to protect Ameri- j
can soldiers in Mexico as a result of !
the Parral incident. Secretary Bak- ;
er. however, refused to throw any j
light on the situation. Meanwhile, j
anxioty began to be manifested over
Pershing's silence.
Secretary Lansing's t willingness to
treat with Mexican Ambassador Ar
redondo over withdrawal of American
troops as urgently sought by General
Carranza mav mean the opening of
preliminary negotiations today or the
first of nxt week.
Predict Withdrawal.
While some administration men said
there had been no change in policy f
toward Mexico and that none was in
sight, others believed the "treating" '
will mean the granting of Carranza's I
request.
Several proposals for a protocol'
now held up, show that the de facto '
regime sought to limit strictly the
number of men encajred and the time
to be eonsumd. The invading army,
operating under the reciprocity agree- j
ment. was to consist of 1,000 cavalry- I
men, Mexican towns were not to be oc-
eupied and the forces were to .vith -draw

But Cursos! There's Change
for Their Escape!
Federal officials are on their way
to swoop down upon a still a real
still, "worm" and all. at West Min
eral in Cherokee county. A deputy
revenue collector left Wichita last
night armed with authority and other
officers are said to have left Kansas
City bent on the same errand.
In Kentucky and Tennessee federal
officials know all the tricks of the
moonshiner's profession and usually
make their captures, then secure the
evidence. But in this Kansas instance
the officials secured the evidence and
will now proceed to make the capture.
It is stated by a federal official that
the revenue department has an actual
photograph of the West Mineral
moonshiners at work with their still
making whisky from Kansas corn.
It has long been suspected tha
there was a still in operation in the
neighborhood of West Mineral and ef
forts have been made to secure evi
dence. One revenue officer, more en
terprising than the rest, managed to
get a "close-up" photograph of the
whole plant with the moonshiners at
work, without disturbing any one. The
photograph, it is said, shpws feature
clearly and after the arrests are made
the photograph will make the best of
evidence.
Late this afternoon no warrants had
been issued here for the arrest of any
moonshiners. The United States mar
shal had no information about the
case. W. H. L. Pepperill. Internal rev
enue collector at Wichita, however,
admitted that a deputy had been sent
from that point.
Other federal officials admitted tht
there was little chauce for the moon

Washington. April 1 5. To further

' bill to require guardsmen to take an
oath to obey the orders of the presi-
dent as well as the governor of their
state. The amendment was presented
by Senator Wadsworth who said it
! originated in the national guard itself.
"The chief purpose of the amend
ment is to place national guard sol
! diers primarily in the service of the
; United States and secondarily in the
service of the state." said Senator
! Wadsworth.
Senator Sout norland, lie publican,
urged adoption of his amendment in

' once to maximum strength.
"Our coast defenses have cost $41.-
000.000 and are among the best in the
world," said he. "But we now have
enough men to man only one-fourth
: of the guns. My amendment would
: give us enough men to man one-half.
I think more men should be trained
i in the use of guns and hence I would
j not leave it to the president to make
