Signs of Dissolution Are Seen
Among the Rank and
File.
Fargo, N. D., April 14.—Signs of
dissolution of the Non-partisan league
are manifest on every side. The
Courier-News is in receipt of a letter
from AV. J. Burnett cn tue candidates
endorsed rejecting the nomination
and assailing the non-resident leader­
ship.
The following from the Courier
News is of interest to the farmers:
"Editor Courier-News: I am sur­
prised at. the action of the Non-parti­
san League convention recently held
in Fargo. That North Dakota is pure­
ly an agricultural slate no person
will deny, and any law thai will ad­
vance or help agriculture will benefit
directly or indirectly every citizen of
this stale.
"The majority of the farmers of
North Dakota believe that they have
not received a just compensation for
their labor and products. They blame
the laws, or more properly the legis­
lature, for most of their troubles.
Hence, they turn to the legislature
for redress and a correction of their
wrongs, and declare 4hat none but
farmers shall represent them. As a
result, a reform movement, has grown
up in past years to correct these
abuses, and give to the farmers what
rightly belongs to them.
Pioneer Progressives Turned Down
"Now, what surprises me is that
most of the men who originated and
are the pioneers of the progressive
movement for reform in the political
affairs of our state, and have given
their time and means to accomplish
it, and are still standing by and work­
ing for it, were turned down by the
convention and new men, unknown
to a majority of the people, without
experience and who have given but
little of their time to the cause, have
been "endorsed by the league tp carry
the 'rfefbrms through, and give the
farmers redress and correct the
afrtififes V}6mpla1n£d of. While the
originators of the movement for re­
form in state politics are expected
to put their shoulder to the wheel,
give their time, means and experi­
ence to these new men and put the
deal through. 1 cannot approve of
such methods, as they are selfish and
jealous and not in accordance with
the high standard of equity and jus­
tice which is claimed as the cardinal
principle of the iNon-partisan league.
Burdick Logical Candidate.
"Hon. U. L. Burdick is the acknowl­
edged and logical candidate of the re­
form forces of this state at the pres­
ent time. And without any animosity
toward .Mr. L. J. Frazier I will say
that if he is a conscientious and true
reformer, and wants to correct the
abuses complained of by the farmers,
he will decline tile honors thrust
upon liim by the convention at Fargo
nnd do all lie can lor the nomination
and election of Hon. IT. L. Burdick
for governor of North Dakota.
"Another grave mistake was the
turning clown of all three of the
present railroad commissioners. One,
at least, should have been retained
as it will take new men almost, the
length of their term of office to be­
come efficient.
Ignore Farmer Candidate.
"And I cannot understand why a
convention of farmers would refuse
to endorse a farmer who has given
liis time and means for our cause,
and whose farm was selected as the
model farm of North Dakota, and who
stood by us for our rights as a mem­
ber of the board of equalization,
namely, Hon. John Steen. I believe
1he fanners are entitled to relief from
the injustices of which they complain
and 1 shall in the future, as in the
past, do what I honestly can to re­
lieve and better their condition. I
joined the Non-partisan league for
that purpose, and I am not willing it
shall be perverted to the selfish per­
sonal ambitions of any set of men.
"If we expect to get, reforms
through the law, we should obey and
respect the law. The Fargo conven­
tion was a ruthless disregard of the
intent and spirit of our present prim­
ary election law.
"W. J. BURNETT."
The Courier-News comments:
"Mr. W. J. Burnett was in dorsed
ly the Non-partisan league as candi­
date for representative from the
Eighth district. His logic has pene­
trated the disguise of the leaders of
the movement. The farmers and
progressives of the state have been
shamelessly betrayed by the manipu­
lations of those who are paying them­
selves salaries and building up a big
printing plant out of the money paid
in by the farmers.
"In order to accomplish this they
planned and carried out the so-called
convention at Fargo, at which their
fiery, soap-box trained coterie of so-

Many Fear Break
With Germany Over
the Submarine Issue
Sussex Affair to Reach Crisis
Within Forty-Eight
Hours.
WASHINGTON SEES
GRAVE SITUATION
Wilson Takes Attitude That Teu­
tons Are Not Keeping
Word.
Washington, April 14.—President
Wilson and the cabinet went over
the submarine crisis today and reaf
llriued their determination to' bring
tiie situation with Germany to an
issue.
The decision to inform Germany
that recent accumulation ol' evidence
of ships destroyed in submarine war­
fare leads to the inevitable conclu­
sion that lier promises are not being
fulfilled, remains unchanged. The
time for dispatching a communica­
tion seemed to be the only point un­
decided.
In congress today a report was cir­
culated that, the forthcoming note
would give notice of a severance of
diplomatic relations. There was noth­
ing to substantiate the rumors any­
where, however. Cabinet officers did
not deny it, as they all had been
bound in honor not to speak of the
subject in any way.
Repeated Indications.
There were repeated indications to­
night that, the note would be a state­
ment. of the American case up to date
without the nature of an ultimatum
and leave the way open for Germany
oavoid the long feared break in
diplomatic relations. It. was plain,
however, that it would be intended
as the American government's last,
word.
Senators of the foreign relations
committee who had been told by the
president that, they would be con­
sulted before any final or drastic
steps were taken, declared tonight
they had not yet been advised of
the details of the next step. Chair­
man Stone conferred with Secretary
Lansing during -tlie^day, but d£r.larLT!
there was nothing new fn the situa­
tion.
Evidence Complete.
At the state department there was
renewed evidence tha tthe United
States considers its case complete
without the affidavits which arrived
on the( steamer, St. Paul. Secretary
Lansing acknowledged that the evi­
dence gathered by the French gov­
ernment to prove the identity of the
submarine involved in the Sussex at­
tack had been placed in possession of
the American government. Such evi­
dence properly substantiated was re­
garded as the capstone of the Amer­
ican case, if one seemed necessary.
Mr. Lansing's only comment on the
evidence was that it would be exam­
ined.
The impression the officials permit­
ted to prevail was that the note to
Germany Avould not go forward until
all the evidence had been consider­
ed, but that enough was at hand to
make up the American case. Some
officials declared the communication
would go forward within 48 hours.
In all official quarters here there
•is evidence o£ the gravity of the
situation. All officials agree that the
accumulation of evidence lias brought
the situation between the two coun­
tries to a point of break or decided
change on Germany's part.
Only disclosures of the exact terms
can show what are the possibilities
of the next developments.

WashingMn, April 14.—Tomorrow is
the date set for re-opening (ho Pana­

said tonight that no word has come
of any change in the plans and that

Seattle, April 14.—Twelve thousand
quarts of beer, seized by the police
who found it on a scow here in the
bay last Tuesday, were dumped into
the bay today by policemen and fire­
men.
The beer was valued at $1,650.
CHINESE FEAR CAPTURE BOATS.
Pekin, China, April 14.—Fearing
that the vessels would be captured,
the China Merchant Co. has canceled
the sailings of its steamers from Tien
Sin for southern ports. The offer of
the Chinese government to guarantee
compensation in events of the ships
being lost was refused.

Albany, N. Y„ April 14.—The sen­

41 to 1, the Welch-Slater bill, to pro­
vide for general military and physi­
cal training of boys between the ages
of It! and lit years. This action was
taken after Gov. .Whitman had sent a
special message, "urging prepared­
ness legislation."
Senator Geo. i\ Thompson of Niag­
ara, head of the legislative* commit­
tee investigating (he New York City
railways, voted in the negative.
"The nation is in no danger of
war," he said, in explaining his vole.
"All of the nations with which it
might, possibly become engaged are
so busy slaughtering one another
that the United States was never
safer than at present. All this pre­
paredness and war talk is inadvis­
able at this time. It may place us
in the position of putting a chip on
our shoulder."
Senator Thompson also said the
•.Mexican CitficuH?' had ^een "occasion­
ed only because some persons had
wished to turn "20 cents into a dol­
lar."
Senator Ogden L. Mills of New
York sharply criticized Mr. Thomp­
son's stand.
"The senator who has just spoken
does not belong here. He belongs in
Lincoln, iNeb., with another man who
has gone through the country talk­
ing the same kind of nonsense. Go to
Belgium and see the devastation
there as a result of unpreparedness."

THREAT MADE TO

Mexican Official Says Our Cam­
paign Has Been a Fail­
ure.
Mexico City, April 14.— "The Mexi­
can government has contended in a
of its notes to the Washington slate
department," said sub-Secretary Ama­
dor, 'that the studing of heavy artil­
lery and slow marching infantry on a
punitive expedition is illogical and the
work of the prcse.nl so-called punitive
expedition has more than demonstrat­
ed this, for the have accomplished
absolutely nothing.! Mexico will, and
has in all of its communications to
Washington, insisted that all punitive
expeditions ninst limited, to certain

The request of the United States
that the present expedition be consid­
ered exceptional cannot be agreed to
by the Mexican government for the
very good reason that each day of its
presence so far inland d6es excite our
people. This is being taken advan­
tage of by enemies of the constitu­
tionalist government, who are endeav­
oring to stage incidents that will

tions.

Attacking Party Mowed Down by

San Antonio, April 11.—The Ameri­
cans, oil whom the Mexicans at Par­
ral tired, were unarmed, according to
an unconfirmed version of the inci­
dent current in Chihuahua and trans­
mitted to Gen. Funs ton today. Ac­
cording to this story, forty of the
troopers entered Parral, presumably
to purchase supplies and were lired
upon. Two were killed and the re­
mainder retreated to the main body
of Iroops encamped outside the city.
The attacking force pursued them and
were met. by a lire from the Ameri­
cans, who were using a machine gun,
killing to Mexicans.
According to this story, the attack­
ing pariy comprised Carranziv soldiers
and civilians.
This report of the Parral incident
was sent from Chihuahua to Gdil. Bell
at Paso, who forwarded it to Gen.
Funston. All allowance was given by
departmental officers to Consular
Letcher's qualifying words "uncon­
firmed version that was current in
Chihuahua," but there was manifest
a disposition to credit the report.
Official Report*
Gen. Funston continued his efforts
today to get an official report from
Gen. Pershing of the occurrence, but
late today no word from him or any
other officer in the punitive expedi­
tion had been received. The last
heard from Gen. Pershing was that he
was moving south from Satevo.
Gen. Funston's orders to officers
along the line of communication to
guard against attacks and to dispalcn
scouts to ascertain movements of any
body of troops, whether Carranza's or
Villa's, are being carried out, it is
understood.
Fail to Locate Troops.
Lieutenant Geroll and Dargue, in an
aeroplane, scouting for some trace of
Gen. Arnulfo Gomez' forces that were
reported to be moving toward Casas
Grandes, failed to locate the troops,
but did make what is said to be a new
record in army aviation, flying 310

CAVALRYMEN STILL HOT
IN PURSUIT OF VILLA
Senator Stone Says to Stay in

WOULD RESTRICT NUMBER.
Mexico City, April 14.—The
Mexican government will insist
with stubborn determination that
any arms of the United States
which enter Mexico territory in
the guise of a punitive expedition
must be limited to 1,000 men of
one service, alone, cavalry, accord­
ing to a statement made to the
Associated Press today by Juan
Neftali Amador, sub-secretary of
foreign relations.
Washington, April J4.—The United
States is prepared to treat with Gen.
Carranza as proposed in his note of
yesterday, for the withdrawal of
American troops from Mexico. Pend­
ing the outcome of the diplomatic ne­
gotiations, however, the status of tho
expedition will remain unchanged and
the pursuit continued.
This was the situation as officially
stated today after President Wilson
and his cabient had considered the
new phases of the Mexican problem
raised by Gen. Carranza's communi­
cation.
No New Orders.
Secretary Lansing said he was pre­
pared to take up the matter with the
de facto government, but would indi­
cate when a reply might be sent. Sec­
retary Baker said no new orders had
been sent to Gen. Kunston and none
was under contemplation.
Both secretaries said there had been
no change In the policy of the admin­
istration which prompted the pursuit
of Villa.
Fixing of Date.
Secrearyj Lansing., would not toy
whether bo'was prepared to negotiAte
with the dft facto government with a
view to the possible fixing of a date
for the withdrawal of American
troops. He indicated that the time
element of an agreement would be
based on what develops in the pur­
suit of the bandits. As the adminis­
tration's attitude is understood here, a
satisfactory demonstration by the Car­
ranza military forces of their ability
to stop once and for all the brigan­
dage in the border states would see
the object of the American expedition
accomplished.
Administration's View.
Senator Stone, chairman of the for­
eign relations committee, is thought
to have voiced the administration's
view to the senate, speaking after a
conference with Secretary Lansing:
"The problem confronting this gov­
ernment," the senator said, "is how
long it would be wise to keep an ex­
peditionary force in Mexico. If we ad­
here to our policy toward Mexico, we
cannot keep the army there. To my
mind, the only alternative to with­
drawing the troops sooner or later is
intervention."
Great interest in the outcome of
the cabinet' meeting today was mani­
fested by members of congress. Many
inquiries as to the course to be pur­
sued were received at the White
House and by members of the presi­
dent's official family.
No Local Politics.
It is understood that it was made
clear in every instance that domestic
politics would not be allowed to have
the slightest weight in dealing with
the problem. Secretary Lansing has
many details to consider. There are
questions of fact which will have to
be cleared up before an agreement
will be possible. The state depart­
ment saw no reason today to retire
from its position that a formal agree­
ment, under which the crossing of the
border had proceeded had been reach­
ed with Carranza, before the order to
move was given.
Mr. Lansing said today he had no
recollection of having assured Arre
dondo, the Mexican ambassador desig­
nate, on March C3 that the troops
would not go farther south than they
then were until the diplomatic situa­
tion was clear, and that he must have
been misunderstood by Mr. Arredon
do.
Will Take Time.
It will take time to gather and study
the facts. Part of the negotiations
with Mr. Arredondo were conducted
by Consular Polk in the absence of
the secretary. Attention has been
given to the fact that the Carranza
note rested its request for negotia­
tions in part upon the statement that
the American expedition was not ful­
filling its object, the capture of Villa
and dispersal of his bands, and could
not fulfill it. The state and war de­
partments are not disposed to allow
this to go unchallenged.
In any event, apparently, the possi­
bility of withdrawing the troops is
not viewed as an immediate one.
It was evident at the war depart­
ment today that details as to the sup­
ply and other problems of maintaining
the force at the front', were being
cared for without interruption.
It also was evident that no move
was being made by Gen. Funston
without carefully weighing the mili
tary chances, should there be an Tin

Engaged.
GERMANS REPULSED
IN OALICIA DISTRICT
Steel Nets Are Set to Trap tha
British Submarines in
Baltic.
London, April 14.—Except for the
artillery wings of the armies, there
has been no lighting on the fronts in
.France and Belgium. Several days
have now elapsed since the Germans
launched the heavy attacks on the
positions in dispute before Verdun,
but their artillery has continued vig«
orously to shell the Lemort Homme
sector, northwest of Verdun, and the
second line positions of tne French to
the east of the Mouse. The French,
in the former sector, are still answer*
ing with their big guns the German
lire and are evidently holding them­
selves in readiness in anticipation
for assaults that usually are preceded
by bombardments.
Convoys of Germans.
In the Argonne the French con­
tinue to operate with their guns
against German points of vantage,
and in the region of Pont-a-Mousson,
they have shelled convoys of Ger­
mans.
On the Russian lines, the Germans
essayed attacks between Lake byea
ten and llsen, but were repulsed, in
Galicia, southeast of Boutchache, tha
Germans also took the offensive, but
they again were repulsed.
According to the Rome official com*
munication, the Italians have captured
the important crest of Lobbia Alt*
from the Austrians and consolidated
the position. Considerable infantry
lighting also has taken place on the
M-rzll and Monte Nero sector, btit
elsewhere along the front tlMrtre have
been only the customary bombard­
ments.
Successes Against Turks.
The Russians report further suc«
cesses against the Turks around Er«
zerum, where the Turks have been on
the offensive for six days, were, re­
pulsed with heavy losses and are fall­
ing back.
One American seaman was aboard
the British steamer, Inverlos, which
is reported to have been sunk by a
German submarine. The captain and
eleven men of the crew of the vessel
have been landed in England, but a
boat with eleven other members of
the crew is missing.
The Germans not only have mined
the southern entrance from the sound
to the Baltic, but also have set steel
nets in the channel to trap English
submarines attempting to enter the
Baltic, says a Norwegian shipping
gazette.

Spain Urges
Joint Action
of Neutrals
Madrid, April 14.—Amadeo Hurta
do, an authority on international law,
has written a letter to the president
of the council of ministers in regard
to the damaging of the steamship,
Sussex. IHe says:
"Spain should take the initiative to
bring about joint action of all neu­
tral countries in order to puti stop
to the illegal system which has such
disastrous consequences for all neu­
trals. The airships of the allied na­
tions are kept busy protecting their
merchant marines and those of neu­
trals.
Germany has no merchant ships at
sea now, and her warships are en­
gaged in war service, while German
merchant ships are protected by In­
ternment in neutral ports. It is in­
consistent with neutrality and if Ger­
man merchant ships continue to have
protection in neutral ports, neutrals
should demand the protection by Ger­
many of their ships and merchant?
