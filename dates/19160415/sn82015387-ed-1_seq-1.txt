Hon. Harvey E. Ellis, who has
bleen an active worker fur Col. Pleas
ant in his campaign for governe.c
lct him at Ponchatoula !at h.i. e'ar
and took the party to Madisonv,!ls
and Mandeville for the speaking. At
Madisonville Sheriff Brewster presid
ed and Col. Pleasant and Hon. Delos
R. Johnson spoke.
At Mandeville the meeting was
called to order by 'Mayor W. G. Davis
and Judge J. L. Phillips presided,
and the same speakers addressed the
citizens. 'Mr. Ellis also spoke at this
meeting. He said that the remark
able feature of the campaign was
that nothing had been said against
the private life of Col. Pleasant, his
enemies being compelled to level
their lances against his supporters, I
who were not even candidates. .his
he believed a condition uniq.b is
American politics and the highest
compliment that could be paid a man
by his enemies. That Parker was
trying, to arouse the passions of the
people and have them vote blindly
against .the Democratic party. Ths,'
Mr. Parker was charging the folloW
era' of Col. Pleasant with doing
things of whicb he himself had been
guilty.
Mr. Parker is making promises to
the people, in order to get the Pleas
ant vote, which he knows he cannot
funI, among them being his prom
ise.. the farmers of 3 1-2 per cent
mody, while the state is paying 7
per cent.
The greatest political demonstra
tions Covington has witnessed took
place at the Parkview Theatre Wed
nesday evening. Band music, fire
works, the !arade of the delegatiot
from Slidell, numbering 240, headed
by the Slidell brass band. with torch
bearers of colored lights, amidst th,
showering , of spacks of' Roman a
candles and the trailing illumination a
of skyrockets, the crowded banquets I
and the cheers of enthusiasm, all
told of the strong Pleasant sentiment a
that made such a demonstrastion a
possible. The theatre was crowded 1
and people were turned away. It I
was a Democratic meeting, with t
- Democratic sentiment, and it fore-it
/ casts the majority Pleasant will get I
over Parker on the 18th day of April, t
just as it over-towers the Parker ral- t
ly at the same theatre several weeks i
ago.
Inside the theatre the Brown band. a
of Abita Springs, mingled musicI
with the applause that greeted the
closing remarks of the speakers.
The stage was filled ei. the most t
promanent Democratic eadeir of the I
parish, and the meeting was prSd-. I
I ed over by Judge J. B. Lancaster.
Bouquets of lowers were present
ed Col. Pleasant by the little Misses
Alma Heints, Martha Bodebender
and Lemmie Meyers. Alma Heintz's
bouquet bore the following card:
"Hoping you will admire the Coving
ton Flowers as much as the Coving
ton people admire you." *Lemmie
'Meyers' card read: 'IHoping you
will be our next Governor. Mr. and
Mrs. A. Frederick." Martha 'Bode
bender handed Col. Pleasant her
flowers with the remark: "Mr.
Pleasant, these dowers are from your
many friends in Covington."
Col. Pleasant was deeply apprecia
tive of this token of the good will
of the people of Covington, and he
took the flowers from the hands of
the little ladies with the considera
tion we imagine he might have be
stowed to similar tokens of esteem
in his younger days, when flowers
from the girls had an entirely dif
ferent meaning.
The meeting was opened by City
Attorney J. Monroe Simmons, who
said: "I have the pleasure and hon
or of calling this meeting to order,
and desire to compliment this audi
ence on its magnitude. I hope, and
feel safe. to assert it as a fact, that
the comparative size of the meet
ing here tonight with that of the
one which' greeted Mr. Parker here
some weeks ago, will be but Indica
tive of the comparative size of the
vote which will be cast for Col.
Pleasant and that which will be cast
for Mr. Parker on Tuesday of next
week, the day of the genercl elec
tion. I am not permitted to attempt
any speech-making tonight mys.4f,
and presuming your permiss.on, pre
sent Hon. Jos. B. Lancaster as our
chairman."
'Preceding the introduction of the
speakers Judge Lancaster made a
rousing good speech, in which he
took up the Issues of the campaign.
H'e said that he felt specially honor
ed at being made chairman of thi:
-Democratic raHlly.
He said that not a whisper o
scandal had gone forth against Pleas
ant. That he was most clean, honest i
and upright. The sole and usualy cry 1
of bossism was being used. -When
leaders were with them they were
leaders; when against them, bosses. i
That when Parker said he was never
with the bosses his memory must
have played him a trick. That when
iuaenburg was not wanted as dis
trict attorney by Blanchard, Parker's
brother, iPorter Parker, was nomi
hated, and while Parker was a
"squaw mas'" in 1904 and could not
vote, he was with the bosses. That
both the bosses and Parker were in a
favor of the Constitutional Conven- t
tion, but Pleasant traveled from one j
part of the State to the other to de
feat it. With Parker governor and b
Roosevelt president, there will be ne
gro supremacy in the state, and you a
may have to go to the polls to pro- n
tect the white voters, for if Parker -
becomes governor Roosevelt will con- h
trol Laousbias.
(Little Frank Ellis, son of Harvey j
E. Ellis, then reeited some verses, a
and his manly berling, as well as h
the triteness of the words he spoke, e
won load applause.
Judge Lancaster then introduced h
Hon. Deles R. Johnson as a man who e
all knew and honored. tl
oma. Dels B. Johnson0 a
Mr. Johnson said that however ti
Washington and St. Tammany might t1
differ in characteristics, thqy had al- c
ways marched shoulder to shoulder tl
to Democratic victory. The primary
was to take the sense of the white a,
Democracy, and whichever eandidate b
was nominated those voters shoul'
stand solidly for him; that 60 per .p
cent of the 150,000 Democratie vote V
was cast for Pleasant, and to all In- t,
tents he shound thea have been elect
ed. That Pleasant carried eyery par
Ish in the State but one. Should not
the white pdople of Louisiana rule?
Violate yotwl pledge In this primary p
and you make a thrust at the very o
principles upon which Democracy i d
established. Roosevelt will be the I
Republican nominee for president.
He called Parker in 1-912, and Park
er went.
Parker's friendship for the farm
er consisted of the profits he made
in the sale of cotton. Pleasant was
reared on a farm, worked on a farm. ,
and practically fought his way from
a farmer boy to the attorney-gener- o
alship of the state.
Mr. Johnson made a plea to th
neople to bury Progressive-Republi- w
canism in Louisiana at the coming
election.
'Mr. Johnson made an excelen'
speech and was heartily applaMed
He said he would be followed by Mr t.i
Jas. Wilkinson, who was a good look
er, a good speaker and a good actor
Mr. Wilklaton.
Mr. 'lknson was presented by k
Judge Lancaster, and he kept th
-adience in continuous laughter from
start to finish. His humorous illus- i
trations of Parker's position were ati
strikingly fit and applicable to the
situation that they became forcefu"
a.uments. While he had nothing
derogatory to say of Mr. Parker':
personal character, politically he4
bhranded him an a weleher of the first
wrater, and he stated that if Mr
.arker should carrty- the state for ,g
the Progressives he wonld become M
the Republican nominee for vicesm
president on the ticket headed by 1.
toosevelt. That the whole thing was m
a scheme to turn the state to the th
Republican party. s. I

Col. Pleasant was tntroduceGdl, -
the eandard bearer of the i l
smo- t of the State of Lousliani. j d
He said he wantq to thank, from p,
-.'.
WHITE LEGHIORH CHICKENS FROM THE BUISSON FARM
*
the bottom of his heart, the young
girls who presented him with th
flowers, and to thank his friends
from Slidell for coming to hear pure
.Democracy preached. He said ,the
flgh was one between Democrats
and Republicans. He had no con
demnation for the Progressive whc
registered and fought as a Progres
sive, but that Progressives had not
the right to remain in the Democrat
ic party and then go over to the pee
pie who represent absolutely differ
ent principles. The Democrats be
lieved in tariff for revenue only and
rule of the people. The Republi
cans believed in a tariff on all things,
practically, that are used by the pgo
pie of this country, and concentra
tion of power in the hands of a few
people. No two parties representing
the same principles were able to ex
ist separately. History and experi
ence show that they 'must merge.
So must the Progressive and Repub
lican parties merge into one.
Col. Pleasant said he had never
bent the knee -i any man in order
that thrift might follow fawning.
That he had never asked the sup
port of the so-called bosses. That
he was bound to them by no promis
es. They had come to him and he
had accepted their support without
pledge, as he had a right to do, and
as any candidate owuld do. That all
the Republicans were supporting
Parker.
He said that everything the state
had came through the Democratic
party. Good schools, good roads and
all we were blessed with. That
more agricultural schools, domestic
science schools, high schools, etc.,
had been established than in 10.
years past. He was uncompromis
ingly opposed to the short ballot,
and that if Parker could carry out
his plans the state would be controll
ed by the greatest political machine
of any s'tte in the Union. .To up
hold the governor further in his pow
er, Mr. Parker wants to go back I
the old convention boss system a.A
abolish primaries. State convetr
tions would then be 'dominated by
the governor, as of old, and patis.L
conventions would be controlled by
the political bosses of"the parishes.
Parker' plans for a Constitution
al Convention of twentydfive mem
bers, the governor to appoint nine.
would leave him but four delegates
to get in order to control the con
vention. With a constitution writ
ten by half a dozen lawyers of New
Orleans, then he could make the h1
of the state. Do you want such :
monarchial system of government?
On the other hand, what could a
Progressive governor, with policies
opposed to Democratic government,
do with a Democrat legislature, be
lieving in Democratic principles?
Colonel Pleasant said that the!
prohibition question was settled for
the next four years. That he had!
given his promise and would live up
to it. The question of state-wide
prohibition had been settled by r
majority of the people of the state.
Col. Pleasant stated his position
on labor, in answet to a question:
from the audience, and showed that
he was not only friendly to labor but
was being supported by' ion laa
in his home town.
The greatest benefits to the peo
ple had come through the Demo
cratic party. Wilson's administra
tion had been one of the greatest
for the people. The system of reg
ional banks had protected the coun
try from Wall street and the money
kings. Wilson had kept us at peact
with the world and given us pros
perity.. Will you cast what will per
haps be the last ballot on your lij
for a party that has done noth!ng
for the State? i

The Parish School Board met in

with all members present.
On motion by Mr. O'Keefe, sec

the last meeting were approved as
printed in The St. Tammany Farmer.
The Superintendent read the fol
lowing report:
Covington, La., April 6, 1916.
To the Honorable President and
Members of the Parish School
Board:
In many ways the Aptil meeting
of your board is the most important
one of the' year. At this time we
take int&: consideratiol what has
been done thus far in the year, and
so reach a decision of how the end
of the. school year will find us.
At this meeting we must decide
just what we will do for or tottrif
running schools for the year to come
and how much shall be spent for re
pairs, etc.
According to your decision before
the term began we have 'been run

term, with an addition where there
were special ward funds available.

has agreed to loeate to the school
the sum of $250 for the purpose of
supplying an agricultural laboratory.
I cannot' express my thanks in too
strong terms for Mr. Price's interest
in this matter and ask for the police
jury the appueciation of the patrons
of that school for the genuine school
spirit sho by. them. While we
are assure7 of a splendid body of 0
