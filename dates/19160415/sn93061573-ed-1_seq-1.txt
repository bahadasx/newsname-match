RIEGEL1N CONCERT A
II
Music lovers of Clayton and the
surrounding country were given a
real treat last Monday evening when
Miss Mabel Hiegelman appeared in
I concert before an appreciative aud
ience at the Mission theatre.
The program consisted of eighteen
numbers, selections from the opera
of the day and the simpler songs
which relieve tho tension incident
to the rendition of, the moro class
ical. v'Mis Hiegelman sings with tho
least possible exertion, naturally as
a bird. Every number was heartily
encored and the prima donna re
sponded graciously with simple and
difficult selections not on her usual
repertoire. t
While not the most difficult selec
tion on her program the aria "l)e
puis le Jour," from Carpentier's
"Louise," was perhaps the most,
beautiful and most artistically ren
dered number, and Miss Hiegelman
!sang it in a manner to juslify the
reputation she has won in the Eu
ropean opera.
"( retchel," her favorile part, and
one of the songs in which she scor
ed such a success during her lour
in leriiiany, was rendered with a
charm of manner anil in dulcet tones
that immediately won her auditors
to I he German opera and "One Fine
Day" I'riini l'uccini's ''.Madam Jiut
lerllx" was especially fine,
i ller hearers were impressed with
i the teVlmiipie and ryflmi of Caro
Nome, from Verdi's '"Higoletto," and
the exquisitliess with which MNs
Itiegelmaii closed her recital by ren-
1 ijering "The Year V at. The

Hiegelman was taken to Dalhart in

NEW INDUSTRY TO LIST

With the addition or a well equip

ton's industries, the metropolis of
North l.aslern New Mexico is rap
idly coming to the front as a placo
where aM the u Is of the agricul
turalists of the surrounding coun
try can he supplied without send
ing out of town.
J. M. Davis is tho man behind tho
gun of the propogating industry, and
will soon be ready to furnish plants
of the tomato, pepper, cabbago and
celery to all who deslro them, y
His propagating pit is full of
plants ready for transplanting to
the open and while his endeavor has
been mostly restricted to tho prop
agation of vegetable plants ho will
also have a quantity of potted pan
seys and violets, -as well as other
house plants. No bulb culturo was
attempted this year but another
year will see Mr. Davis in a posi
tion to furnish all of tho popular
bulhulons plants such as crocus,
gladoli, hyacinth and tulips.
With the completion of a green
house about tho middle, of August

will probably forbid such work this
coming winter, but as tho business
is enlarged it is the idea of tho pro
prietor to raise every flower and

daise in a propagating pit or a green
house.
This is the first season that Union
County farmers have bad tho op
portunity to purchase homo grown
plants for transplanting into their
gardens and fields, having hither

of town propagators or nurseries.

SCHOOL BOARD ENJOINED
Ity a temporary injunction issued.
by Judge Lieb, the 13th inst, on
prayer of H. B. Woodward, repre
senting a number of citizens of this
school district, t.ho school board of
School District No. One is enjoined'
from selling tho recent issue of
bonds on tho date set for sale, al
though they may receive bids.
Judge Lieb, in granting the in-
junction, has for the- time 'being
settled the matter of a suitable site
for the new school house, for the
simple reason that no school house
can be built until the bonds are sold.
On the 24th insL at Raton. Judge
Lieb will decide whether the re
straining order will bo dissolved or
made perpetual. i
This injunction is the outgrowth
of some bitterness which has arisen
in connection with the locatioa of
the school.
It seems that the school board bas
contracted to purchase what they
believe to be a suitable site from the
townsite company, and that this silo
is not to the liking of many of the -residents
of this district
Those In opposition claim that
there are more suitable locations to
ba bad. for nothing, two. offering a
IÓ00 bonus, and that the school
board was hasty in their action,
which should now bo rescinded and
a considerable sum saved the dis
trict by taking advantage of tho of
fers of free land and bonus.
