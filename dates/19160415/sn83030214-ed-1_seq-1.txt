CARRANZA INSISTS U. S. EXPEDITION
BE LIMITED TO 1,000 CAVALRY
Mexico City. April 14.?The Mexiean government will insist
with inflexible determination that any armed American force which
enters Mexico as a punitive expedition be limited to 1.000 cavalry,
according to a statcrr.ent to-day by Juan Nettali Amador, Car
ran/a's Sub-Secretary of Foreign Relations.
"The sending of heavy artillery and slow marching infantry
on a punitive expedition," said Senor Amador, "is illogical. The
work of the present so-called punitive expedition has more than
demonstrated this, for they have accomplished absolutely nothing.
"The Mexiean government has insisted that the limit of the
zone extend not further than forty miles. nor, should punitive ex
peditions be allcwed in the territory of either country for an un
limited time.
"Our note of March 18. article 8. specifies the number of troop
whiih may paEs the boundary line must never exceed 1,000 and these
must not remam m the zone for more than tive days. exeept in very
unusual cases."
The Sub Secretary denied the reports that ccrtain high army
Offtcera had served notice on General Carranza that unless the
American troops were withdrawn vvithin a specihed time they
would join in an attack on therrt.
