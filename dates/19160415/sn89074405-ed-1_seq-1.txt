untenable.
From conditions up the river, the
rise is expected to continue all day.
Tlje Northern Pacific bridge here is

N. April 15.—Claims
that the Mandan water works pump
ing plant could' be operated cheaper
by electric current furnished by the
Randan Electric company, than by
power generated by the city equip
ment, will be thoroughly investigated
by a special committee named by
President H. L. Henke. This commit
tee Is composed of Commissioners Mc
Donald,-Lang and Edquist.
Citizens have advanced the claim
that under the present conditions the
pumping plant is not operated to the
limit of its capacity, and that fuel
burned is excessive for the amount of
electric power used
No criticism is levied against any
official, but: it is pointed out that the
present plant will be adequate when
the.city reaches a population of 20,000,
but the present water need is not such
to kiep the pump working more than
a quarter of the time.
At the city commission meeting the
officers of the Mandan Electric com
pany presented proposals to furnish
electric, current to operate" the pumps.
Thi# scale of prices' will be thoroughly
investigated by the special committee,
who will also delve deep into the fig

There has been no planting and the

One incident described by an Ameri

the'sacks whenever possible, and ex
tracting a few grains. This was their
only food, the American said they told
him.
Arrivals from the interior of Sen

the food supply was absolutely shut

Unconfirmed Reports of Second Fight With Thompkin*s
Troops—Officials Doubt that First Assault Was
as Serious as Reported by Mexicans.
Washington, April 15.—Secretary I/anslng pronounced the Mexican
situation unchanged in any aspect. Unless official reporta to General
Funston disclose a more grave situation at Parral. where the Ameri
can troops were fired upon, than now is believed to exist, there la noth
ing to indicate that a change might be coming In the near future. Sec
retary Baker said there was no uneasiness at the war department be
cause of the lack of news from General Pershing, as the latter has a
habit of reporting only when he has definite and Important informa
tion to communicate.
DOUBT SERIOUSNESS OF FIGHT.
Reports from other commanders In the field gave no new status
to the pursuit of Villa and his bandits. As time passes without official
information of the Parral fighting from American sources, officials are
inclined to doubt the clash was as described by early Mexican advices..
It Is thought probable that the detachment engaged at Parral had1
passed on or around the town Immediately after the disorder was
quelled and was proceeding about Its business of pursuing Villa, hriadrid
for its original destination beyond Parral.
UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF SECOND FIGHT.
Washington, April 15.—State department dispatches from El Paso
refer to unconfirmed reports of a second fight with American troops at
Parral. General Funston telegraphed the war department that he had
not heard from General Pershing for three days. Secretary Baker said
that General Funston is urging General Pershing to rush a report on
the Parral incident. General Funston'a message Is taken to indicate
that the silence of Pershing probably is due to his inability to get in
formation. rather than to an interruption of communication. General
Funston has been in communication with other authorities In dose»,
touch with the advance expedition, but had asked General Pershing to
report oftener if possible to keep the war department advised. Secre
tary Baker said he still is waiting for a report on the conferences be
tween General Pershing and Generals Herrera and Gutierrez.
Ellseo Arredondo. Garranza's ambassador here, said he had no fur
ther information of the fighting at Parral, nor of the reports of a
later clash, and had been advised of no developments in Carram's
proposal for the withdrawal of the American troops. Dispatches to
the Carranaa embassy said the arrival of Carransa Ms party in
Mexico City was accompanied by ropular demonstrations.
A battle at Guernavaca, a Zapata stronghold, is
nent. The advance guard of Une Carransa forces is said to be la
