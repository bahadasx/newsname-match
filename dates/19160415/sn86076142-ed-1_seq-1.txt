apartments in the Butler building. He expired without a word and
without a gesture indicating pain. He was preparing to re-enter court
and was apparently seeking a brief rest before proceeding with the
case at Issue.
The deceased had been under an acute mental strain for several
days, being engaged in the trial of an Important water case that had
been drawn out' for three years. -
The deceased was one of the brightest legal lights In the state.
He began the practice of law In 1K77 when Judge Curler occupied the
bench nt Belmont, For several years he waH district attorney of
Esmeralda county and was at one time candidate for the supreme
judgeship. A man of Impulsive nature and ruggedness of character, he
made many friends and was respected even by his enemies. A large
family mourns this deep and sudden loss.

The deceased arose early this morn
ing, as was his custom and took a long
walk about the mines and mills. He
returned to bis office In the Butle:
building, where his living apartments
are also located. He had a brief talk
concerning the case with Mr. Seyler,
Charles Keough and another witness
in the case. One of his sons, Harold,
overheard one of the others ask:
"What are we going to do about the
case today?" He said his father re
plied: "We will do the same as yes
terday." Mr. Bowler approached the bed
where his son was lying and said:
"Son, I don't feel very well. I'm going
'o lie down for a couple of hours."
Harold tlien told him that he was go
ing to get up and If his father wanted
to sleep he would waken him when de
sired. The young man said that his
father raised up in bed and fell back
without a word.
Dr. McLeod, who was the first phy
sician on' the scene, says that death
was not Instantaneous, but that he
-emalned alive for several minutes
after being stricken.
Hon. P. M. Bowler, known all over
Nevada as "Patsy", was one of the
oldest attorneys In the State of Ne
vada and had a widespread reputation
In both civil and criminal cases. He
lost in a bank failure.
Beneath his keen sarcasms there
was a heart of kindliness. It was t
common remark of his: "I hate that

I would travel a hundred miles to dt

The decased was aged 68 years. He
was born at New Orleans and when a
child removed with his parents to

FI NSTON S HEADQUARTERS OVER PERSHING'S UNBROKEN SILENCE
rnvr viiNINfl PARRAL. GENERAL FUNSTON LAST NIGHT URGED
GENERAL PERSHING TO EXPEDITE HIS REPORT.
Edward Clifford had been a sufferer
for the last three years from a compli
cation of asthma, rheumatism and
pulmonary trouble following a serious
attack of pneumonia and it had been
his custom to pass the winter at Long
Beach, California, with his daughter,
Mrs. E. E. Warburton. In accordance
with this practice the inclement sea
son or the high altitudes was spent
with his daughter, but he had scarce
ly reached the coast when he was
seized with a recurrent attack ol
pneumonia. For some time his life
was despaired of but he finally rallied
and regained his strength slowly.
In the most critical stage of his ill
ness news was received of the death
in Tonopah of his eldest son, Edward,
hut the news was suppressed as the
family thought the shock would be fa
tal. It was not until the return of Miss
Grace Clifford from attending the fun
eral that her father divined the truth,
but he gave no sign that he was aware
of the fact. It was not until after
his complete recovery that he admit
ted his knowledge of the bereavement.
As the southern season advanced it
was deemed best for Mr. Clifford to
return to the more bracing air of the
desert country and he began the jour
ney, accompanied by his daughter.

too stimulating and the heart action
became alarming. Pneumonia was tn
duced and the old gentleman made an
other gallant fight against his old
enemy, but his weakened condition
was incapable of further resi'tmoe
and the patient slowly declined until
he passed away at 12:30 this morn

Edward Clifford, Sr., the warm friend of Jim Butler and the man
who made the second locations In Tonopah, died shortly after midnight
in the Hotel Golden at Reno. The body will be brought to Tonopah
and interment will be beside the partner of his Joys and sorrows who
preceded him to eternal rest by six years.
Mr. Clifford was one of the most successful pioneer prospectors
of Southern Nevada who followed the lure for forty years by sharing
in the prosperity of old Tybo, Austin, Belmont and finally coming to
Tonopah in response to a call from Jim Butler. He located three
of the best claims of the inside district. He was interested in the
Ellendale rush and was one of the first foreman of the old Spanish
Belt mines In the eastern end of Nye county. Deceased was a mem-
ber of Tonopah council, Knights of Columbus and was largely inistru-
mental in establishing the handsome home of the order in the old
Bar" let t mansion.
tera. Extreme unction had been ad
ministered the previous evening, by
Father Tubman and the end was ac
cepted without' a tremor as the soul
winged its way home.
Mr. Clifford was ot Scotch-Irish an
cestry, born in Ireland, and came to
this country whe a mere boy. His first
occupation was in the coal mines oi
Maryland whence he gradually made
his way to Pittsburg, Colorado and
Wyoming finding employment in the
coal mines in these states. Still his
desire to reach the goal of his hope
in the far west was not attained un
til he entered Nevada and homesteaded
what is known as the Stone Cabin. In
the seventies when the Spanish Belt
mines were operates by the Bernhei
mer syndicate of New York and lead
furnaces were Installed for the reduc
tion of ores Mr. Clirford tfas foreman
of construction and started the famous
Barcelona tunnel that became the
principal working scheme of the com
pany. The family came Into prominence
in later years through the discovery
of high grade gold deposits at a p6int
that was named Ellendale in honor
of Mrs. Joe Nay who made the dis
covery In company with her husband
and brothers Ed and John. Mr. Clif
ford was the locator of the high grade
he
the
gold mines at Clifford also in
northeastern part of Nye county.
For years father and sons ranged a
bunch of sheep, but when the wool
market broke, the sheep were sold and
the family returned to stockraising.
Mr. Clifford was married in Mary
land and two ot the boys Edward and
Jim were born in that state. Mrs.
Clifford died six years ago from the
effect of a runaway accident by which
she was thrown from a buggy and sus
tained injuries that caused her death
a week later.
The deceased was largely interest
ed in real estate, cattle and mines. Ha
was an ardent member ot Tonopah
Council, Knight ot Columbus, wherein
he was initiated four years ago. It was
through hia generosity that the coun
cil owns the present home ot the order
as he advanced the money for its pur
chase. The council has repaid the
loan and the building, which is one
of the finest in Tonopah, is free from
debt. The half masted flag flying
from the home on the summit of
Brougher avenue notified the town of
the demise of Mr. Clifford.
Funeral arrangement will not be
made until after the arrival of the
family with the body tomorrow morning.
