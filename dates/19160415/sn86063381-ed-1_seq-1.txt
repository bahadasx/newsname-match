BONDHOLDERS MANY
MILLIONS IN INTEREST
New York, April 15.Twelve mil
lion, five hundred thousand American
dollars' interest will be paid to Am
erican investors by the French and
English governments through J. P.
Morgan & Co., here today for the
first six months' use of the half bil
lion dollar Anglo-French loan re
cently negotiated.
This payment today is but a small
part of the cash interest England and
France will pour into the American
pockets during the next five years.
Every six months they will pay $12,-
500,000, or $125,000,000 for the five
years, which is more than one-tenth
of a billion dollars they will have
given Americans for the use of their
money in fighting the Teutons.
The interest that these two govern
ments must pay for the use of Amer
ican money with which to continue
their war is enough to supply each
one of 2,500 persons an independent
fortune.

Sussex Case Up.
Washington, April 15.President
Wilson and the cabinet went over the
submarine crisis again today and re
affirmed their determination to bring
the situation with Germany to an
issue.
The decision to inform Germany
that recent accumulation of evidence
of ships destroyed in submarine war
fare leads to the inevitable conclu
sion that her promises to the United
States are not being fulfilled, remain
ng unchanged. The time of dispatch
ing a communication to Berlin ap
peared to be the only point unde
cided.
Rumor of Break.
ZP-IXL congress yesterday a report was
widely circulated that the forthcom
ing note would in itself give notice
of a severance of diplomatic rela
tions. Cabinet officers did not deny
it, upon the ground that they all
have been bound in honor by the
president not to speak upon the sub
ject in any way.
There were repeated indications to
day that the note would be a state
ment of the American case up to date,
without anything in the nature of an
ultimatum, and would still leave the
way open for Germany to avoid the
long-feared break in diplomatic rela
tions. It was claimed, however, that
it would be intended as the American
government's* last word.
Spain Takes Issue.
Madrid, Spain, April 15.(Via
Paris)Amamadeo Hurdato, an au
thority on international law, has
written a letter to the president of
the council of ministers in regard to
the damaging of the steamship Sus
sex. He says:
"Spain should take the initiative to
bring about joint action of all neut
ral countries in order to put a stop
to the illegal system which has such
distressing consequences to all neut
rals. The warships of the allied na
tions are kept busy protecting their
merchant marine and that of neutral.
In War Service.
"Germany has no merchant ships
now at sea and her warships are en
gaged in war service, while German
merchant ships are protected by in
terment in neutral ports throughout
the world. It is inconsistent With
neutrality if the German merchant
ships continue to have protection in
neutral ports, neutrals should demand
of the Germans the protection of
their citizens and merchantmen."

A Nice Quiet Little Song
SECOND BATTLE MAY
HAVE BEEN FOUGHT
AT PARRAL. MEXICO
Carranza Messenger to Japan Refuses
to Deny Alliance
Report.
NO WORD FROM PERSHING
FUNSTON IS ANXIOUS
Troops to Remain in Mexico Fun
ston Instructed to Take Steps
Needed.
El Paso, April 15.The mystery
over what really happened at Parral
became more baffling today due to
the amazing variety of conflicting re
ports which poured into El Paso from
many points.
The most plausible explanation was
offered in an account of the affair
brought here today by an American
from Chihuahua City. This man
said the trouble started when two
American soldiers were sent into Par
ral by Major Tompkins to make ar
rangements for the purchase of sup
plies. Their presence aroused the
people of the city who had already
been agitated by reports that the ad
vancing American troops were going
to take possession of the town.
Attacked by Mob.
The two soldiers were surrounded
by an angry mob and some shots
were fired which killed one of them.
The mob then poured out in the di
rection of the main body of the
Americans and some indiscriminate
fighting took place in which a num
ber of Mexicans were wounded. The
Carranza garrison assisted in restor
ing order, according to this account
and later the Americans passed quiet
ly through the city.
General Gavira said today that he
had received no report to indicate
the Parral incident has inflamed the
people over which he is in command.
Villa Stronghold.
"It must be remembered that Par
ral was one of Villa's strongholds,
nd contained many Villistas," Gavira
continued. "When the Americans ap
peared it would have been an easy
matter for these "Villistas to make the
ignorant believe that the Americans
intended to capture and hold their
town. This evidently happened."
A Second Battle.
Washington, April 15.United
States consular dispatches forwarded
from El Paso today carried reports
of a second fight between the Amer
ican troops and residents of Parral.
The reports gave no details.
Great Activity.
Columbus, April 15.There is
much activity here, the most since
the United States troops crossed the
border. Entrenchments are being
constructed along the line of com
munication. Fifty-four motor trucks
were unloaded and put into service
this morning. There is indications
of intention for an immediate with
drawal.
Seek Alliance of Japan.
El Paso, April 15.General Ramon
Iturbe, enroute to Japan on a special
mission for Carranza, today refused
to confirm or deny the report that
Carranza seeks the alliance of Japan.
No Report Received.
San Antonio, April 15.Despite
the consular reports of the Parral af
fair, General Funston is badly wor
ried on account of the lack of Gen
eral Pershing's official report of the
American troops' battle at Parral.
Riot Follows Clash.
El Paso, April 15.Private ad
vices say that rioting and much prop
erty damage was done following the
clash of American troops and resi
dents of Parral. Carranza officials
deny that there was rioting follow
ing the fighting.
Funston Sends Message.
Washington, April 15,General
Funston's long code message which
formed the subject of a midnight con
ference between Lansing and Wilson
may alter Mexican plans. A specu
lation says that more troops for Mex
ico is asked. Also the taking of the
Mexican railways and the shifting of
the Columbus base may have been re
quested by Funston.
Up to President.
Washington, April 15.Adminis-
tration supporters and opponents in
congress will leave the Mexican and
German situation entirely with the
president. All promised their sup
port even in the most drastic actions.
To Discuss Suggestions.
Washington, April 15.Detailed
instructions as to his official attitude
toward Carranza's withdrawal sug
gestions have been sent to Counsel
Rogers in Chihuahua City by Secre
tary Lansing. Officials refuse to com
ment. It is understood that the dis
patch informs that the United States
is willing to discuss the suggestions
formally.
Ammunition is Sent.
Columbus, April 15.The base
camp at Columbus is almost stripped
of troops since reinforcements to the
Mexican expedition have been sent.
Infantrymen are sleeping in their
uniforms preparing to leave on a mo
ment's notice. Several trucks carry
ing 388,000 rounds Of ammunition
have hurriedly departed.
SANATORIUM TO

A meeting of the directors of the
sanatorium will be held soon to plan
the final arrangements. A superin
tendent of the nursing force will be

ble for tuberculosis patients from
Clearwater county to- receive the
benefits of the sanatorium at the same
rates offered to patients from the or
iginal three counties.

TROUT SEASON OPENS
You may legally get out
your old trout fishing set to
day. The trout season in Min
nesota officially opened to
day. This came in face of
the fact that the ice is not
broken up in the lakes near
here.
The season for the trapping
of mink closed today.
Crews of men from the state game
and fish commission today placed
spawn nets in Wolf lake and in Cass
lake at the south of the Turtle river
for the gathering of pike fry. The
fry will be sent to the local fish
hatchery and to the other five fish
hatcheries in the state at Glenwood,
Detroit, Granite Falls, St. Paul and
Tower.
The work is being done under the
direction of S. C. Bailey, local game
warden.
Season Closed.
On account of the spawning season
it is unlawful to catch or have in
possession at this time any pike. May
first is the opening of the pike seasofj.
If the work here is successful, more
crews will be put at work, according 'i
to Carlos Avery, state game and fish
commissioner, who was in Bemidji
Friday.
In an interview with a Honejpr
representative, Mr. Avery stated tfci*v
the actual worth in dollars ati&i&Bttr
of the animals, birds and fish which
are taken and used every year ill
Minnesota amounts to a vast sdm.
"While it is impossible, of course,
to definitely and positively determine
what this value may be, we are in
possession of sufficient Information
to indicate in a general way what the
value is," said Mr. Avery.
8,000 Deer Killed.
There were, during the past year,
according to Mr. Avery, at a low esti
mate, killed and used as food in Min
nesota, 500 moose and 8,000 deer,
100 bear and miscellaneous smaller
animals, the food value of which at 16
cents per pound would amount to
$211,000.
Estimates carefully made after
close and thorough inquiry of the
number of the various kinds of game
birds taken during the past year, dis
closes a total of 1,011,300 so taken
and estimating the value of these at
from 25 cents each for the smaller
birds to fifty cents for prairie chick
ens and ducks and $1.50 for wild
geese, shows a total value of $607,-
450 or a total of $718,450 as the food
value of the game birds taken and
consumed in Minnesota in one year.
Fish Value Greater.
"The value of the fish taken and
used is manifestly much greater,"
said Mr. Avery. "The results of
commercial fishing which is carried
on quite extensively in international
and interstate waters and in certain
inland waters is quite definitely
known and the total production of
such fishing for the past year ap
proximates a value of $250,000. This
is less, rather than greater, than the
actual figures might disclose as all
estimates are made on a very conser
vative basis. Nets which are allowed
to be used for the purpose of taking
whitefish, fish houses permitted on
the ice, angling for sport and other
wise, takes a toll from the lakes and
streams during each year of 2,700,-
000 pounds, worth in money at the
lowest estimate, $135,500."
The total of the value of food taken
from the wild animals, birds and fish
in the state in one year is, accord
ing to Mr. Avery, at least $1,103,960.
Many Fun Taken.
Over $1,000,000 worth of fure are
taken each year in the state, accord
ing to Mr. Avery. To insect eating
birds credit must be given for at
least one per cent of the annual ag
ricultural production of the state
which would amount to $2,600,000.
The value of the tourist trade to
Minnesota, hunters, fishers, etc., at
the present time, as a source of in
come to the people, is $1,336,400.
A recapitulation of the above esti
mates by Mr. Avery yields a total of
almost $6,000,000 as the* food and
commercial value of the products of
animals, birds and fish in the state
in one year.
