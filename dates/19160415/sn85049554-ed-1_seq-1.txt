the treatment' in Germany of British

that British prisoners in the Witten

during the typhus epidemic last year,
lacking proper clothing, medical care
and food, and being treated brutally
by the German guard.
"The British charges evidently are
inventions," says the Gazette. "The

the conclusion that hygienic conditions
in general were satisfactory."

the increasing practice on the ranges

thus kept in. better condition, and
losses from exposure become less.,

Senator Creates

Guardsmen.
Charges That Guard
Crooked Met by Pretests From Pom*

Accuaed of Listening t« Jealous Reg*
ular Army Officers Who Oppose Fed«
eral Asaiatanoe to State Volunteers,
Washington, April 16.—To further
strengthen nationalisation of the na
tional guard, the senate today by a vote
of 33 to 23 amended the army bill to
require the guardsmen to take on oath
to obey the orders of the president as
well as the governor of their state. The
amendment was offered by Senator
Wadswortb.
"The chief purpose is to place na
tional guard soldiers primarily in the
service of the United States and sec
ondly. in the service of the state/' said
Senator Wadsworth.
Senator Sutherland, republican, urged
adoption of his amendment increasing
the coast artillery corps at once to
maximum strength.
"Our coast defenses have cost til.
000,000 and are among the best In the
world," he said, "but we now have
enough men to man only one-fourth of
the guns. My amendment would give
us enough men to man one-half."
Senator Borah, republican, attaek«W|
ing federal pay for the national guarda?^
aroused the senate with a charge thAt"
the $8,000,000 a year now appropriated
4
by the government for the national#
guard was "shamefully wasted and
some of it embezzled."
'That's a pretty serious charge,"'
said Senator Pomerene, demociat, in
terrupting.
"Well, I make it without any quali-(,v's
fication." Senator Borah replied, and'
he read from war department report*V*"1
to show that most of the f^nd had,
been utilized by officers of the' na
tional guard for themselves, and en
listed men had practicalJy no t«iueflt
of IC
,Says Rfpords ShowJt,. -f~«
"If senators here -will examlneK-tMQrjr'
records," Senator Borah continued.1
they will heeltate about appropriating
$50,000,000 for the guaid as it-is now
proposed to do. The way tht ftlBoeif
have be.en utilizing the fund for them
selves is shameful and can not be de-'
fended except for political exigency.
"In this bill you are not preparing
for war. You are not giving the people .v
what they expect to pay for. We are^,^
filling this bill full of political ap-*
proprlatlons and you can riot proceed a„.
step under the guise of national pre
paredness."
Senators Pomerene and Reed,de-.
fended the rational guard, declaring
that if there had been Irregularities
there were remedies at law. tg
Thieves in Regular Army Too.
"There may & thief in th© national
guard, but so has there beeh in the
regular army and senators from this,
body have been sent to jail," declared
Senator Reed.
"But I am not willing to hear hon
orable men criticised without sufficient
provocation. I will not stand by while •1-.t
this military committee, advised by
regular army officers, who are inter
ested to see the guard destroyed, get
the senate to pass a bill that would de
stroy the only army in tWs country
created out of civilians.
•Senator Lodge defended the regulal
army. ••'•Wj
"The regular army has fought and,
won all our battles and is fighting for
us In Mexico today," he said, "and I am
sick and tired of hearing it attacked."
Cummins Doubte Chargea.
Senator Cummins, republican. Bald
he was shocked at Senator Borah's
statement.
"I do not believe the charges that
guard officers have misappropriated
the nation's money—stolen it—for there
is no moral difference," he said. "I
think consideration of this bill should^
be halted until the senate ascertains?
whether officers of the guard are guilt| ,:
of such chargea"
Points to Ohio Guards.
Senator Borah in support of hi±tr.
charge said:
"I find according to the report of the
war department that In the Ohio na
tional rifle match. In 1911, »13,89« was
expended on the state rifle team, all otj
whom were officers. In the period frosfcy
July 22, 19 U, to Sept 23, 1»13, an of
fleer, a colonel, drew pay to the amount
of $1,411. In the period from July 1, As
1911, to Sept 13, 1912, another officer*.
also in the same state, a colonel, drew
pay to the amount of 11,401.
"In the period from July 90, 1911, t«^
Sept. 1, 1918, a third colonel In the
state drew pay to the amount of $1,299.
So the entire appropriation or appor
tlonment to the state of Ohio for thl»
year pmctlcally went to the officers
and there is no report that any porttOtyAi
of it Is going to the enlisted men."
