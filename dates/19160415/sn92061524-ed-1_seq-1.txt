New Mexico City Election
What they Foretell of this Falls Election
Hope for Bette Things Ahead v
8
Santa F N. M. April 14. The
first real tests of political stren
gth in New Mexico Ithis year
have resulted in Democratic vic
tories. In the municipal elections
at Albuquérque and Raton, which
were bitterly contested Demo
cratic mayors and other city
officials were elected,1 ánd at
Gallup big inroads were made
on Republican control, the Demo
crats electing two of the five
town trustees and the. town
treasure, and defeating a $50,000
bond issue for municipol purpose
on the ground that it was uncall
ed for and unecessary. .
In Raton Dr. J. J. Shuler,
Democratic mayor, who ( has
given the Gate City a splendid
water system, a municipal build
ing, a park system and other
modern improvments, was , re
elected by a majority of 140," de
feating a Republican , canidate
backed by the Van Houten-Sprin-ger
combination, representing
the strongest G. O. P. interests
in Colfax County, and one of the
strongest county organizations
in the state. The Van Houten
Springer interests were vitally
concerned in the fight, as they
control the present electric light
and power plant in Raton, and
the re-election of Shuler un
doubtedly means the establish
ment of a municipally Wned
lighting and power system. ; In
addition to Shuler, all the other
Democratic candidates, with the
exception of one councilman,
were victorious, the new council
stands seven Democrats to one.
Republican.
In the face of strenuous oppo
sition on the part of the Republi
can leaders of the county as well
as the city, Henery Westerf eld
Democrat, was elected mayor of
Albuquerque, defeating Mayor
D, H.. Boatright, the Republican
candidate. The Democrats also
elected the city treasure iind wo
alderman, and the council is now
Democratic, , .
AG. 0, P. split has developed
at Gallup, where the "organiz
ation" was ignored in the selec
tion of some, of the Republican
candidates, and as a result the
Democrats of McKinley county
expect to show surprising gains
at the general election this year.
.'Clayton elected a Democratic
mayor, T. H. Rixey defeating
H. J. Hammond the Republican
candidate. .Hammond is presi
dent of the First National Bank
of Clayton and a Union county
member of the Republican cen
tral committee. ; ,
In , Santa Fe Thomas Doran
running on a straight Democratic
ticket, cut down v the majority
given Mayor Sargent two years
ago. The city and county G. O.
P. organizations combined for
the city cámpaign arid. raised a
"slush fund" of $2,000, which
was headed by a contribution
of $200, from U. S. Senator T. B
Catron. Contributions of $100
each were made " by Attorney
Clancy and Mayor Sargent, who
is also state auditor. ; As usual
threats of police persecution and
court persecution, and of . tax
raises, were freely .indulged in to
intimidate voters, and probably
the most brazen, manipulation of
a jury selection in the history of
New Mexico was resorted to.
Out of 365 names placed in the
jury box for the spring term of
the district court, only 17 were
those of Democrats, although the
Democratic voters of the county
were entitled to 145, and of the
51 men drawn for the grand and
petit juries only two were mem
bers of the Democratic party
Moreover, 37 of the 51 jurors
drawn were residents of the pre
cinct' that forms the strongest
Democratic ward in the city of
Santa Fe, where the Republican
bosses desired to present an ob
ject lesson 6f their power to dic
tate and control. . . '
The importance of the Demo
cratic victories in Raton arid. Al- j
bupuerpue, and the showings !
made elsewhere, cannot be over
estimated; The results prove
that the Democrats of New Mex
ico are in fighting trim, and they
will go into the big campaign
this year determined to win. '.

Roy Will Be Incorporated
, -- v. í ; ".
. Reports from the April Session,
of the Mora County Board of Su
pervisors are to the ' effect ; that
Roy's petition for Incorporation
has been passed on favorably and
under due process of law) we will
become an incorporated town in
October next. . .A .'.'
Andrew Knell Dead
Moisture--No End Of It
Several inches of wet enow has
fallen during the past 38 hours.
It is still falling and the prospect
fon a wheat crop is the best we
ever had with more than three
times last year,s acreage. ! .
Andrew Knell, one of the old
est and best citizens of this part
of New Mexico, died at Pasade-
n Calif. Tuesday. , His daugh
ter, Mrs, T, E. .Mitchell, of Al
bert, has been there caring for
horn since the death of .his wife,
last winter. Mr. Knell came to
New Mexico over SO years ago,
an old man then and an invalid.
He conducted a successful mer
cantile business at Albert and in
geleral was one of the live ones
until advanced years barred him
from further activies., , He lived
to the extreme age of ninety two'
years. ' , .
His death closely following the
death of his wife and of Mr. Mit
chelPs mother, ' and the illness
and accidents which have besét
the Mitchell family the past win
ter, entitles them to the sympa
thy which this community freely
extends. ' ,
Leach- Entertainer
The Roy Theater entertained .
one of its unusually large aud
iences Tuesday night with a three
reel picture story of unusual in
terest and a ''chaser". . As ad
vertised J, Olen Leach entertain
ed betwéen acts with his' famous
monologues in dialect. He gave
us only his newer readings here
but has his old favorites on his
repertoir and is using them with
telling effect where he is not so
well known as here in Roy;
Mr. Leach has planned for the
summer and will make a hit with
any old kind of an audience. We
foresee á pleasant and profitable
season for him and reeognize his
change of occupation' as ' merely
the awakening of a genius to use
the talents nature has given him
rather than drudge at an uncon
genial occupation. - ' V, .
Mrs. Leach .and1; that wonder
ful boy came with him and greet
ed friends here. ' She will visit
at the parental Crouse , home at
Mills for a short time before re
turning to her home in springer.
Col. Reddic returned from his
old home at Butler, Pennsylvania
where he spent the winter, and
is eager to get out to his farm in
Palouse valley; His 80 years of
life rest lightly upon his should
ers and his military bearing lend
force to his "report of the "Pre
paredness" of. the Eastern States
where'all kinds of .factories are
working overtime making nvar
munitions for Europe,
