"Apparently this principle Is to be
applied? I suppose, on aproved Prus?

Contending that the Poles have had
| an Illuminating exerlence of the Ger?
man ideas of a free evolution of this
kind. Mr. Asqulth continued:
"The attempt to Germanize Poland
has been tor the last 20 years at
I once the strenuous purpose and colos?
sal failure of Prussian domestic pol?
icy. Nobody knows this better than
the chancellor, for he has been one
of Its principal instruments.
"The wholesale strikes of Polish
children against the attempts to force
the employment of the German lan?
guage; the barbarous flogging? In?
flicted upon them, the arrest and im?
prisonment of their mothers, contin?
ued the premier, "form a black chap?
ter even in the annals of Prussian
[culture. It is with this record that
the chancellor shed tears over the
fate of what he calls the long sup?
pressed Flemish race. I wonder what
the Flemish race itself thinks of the
prospect the chancellor opens out to
it
"The chancellor says that after the
war there must be a new Belgium,
which must not be a Franco-English
| vassal, but between whose people and
the Germans, who burned their
churches, pillaged their towns, tram?
pled their liberties, there is to be
In the future 'the collaboration of
neighbors.'
"My answer is a very simple one.
The allies desire and are determined
to see once again the old Belgium.
Sho must not be allowed to suffer per?
manently from the wanton, wicked
Invasion of her freedom, and that
which has been broken down must
he repaired and restored."
Declaring that he would not waste.

words upon the imperial chancellor's
'lame and half hearted attempt to
{justify the wholesale use ot the sub?
marine for the destruction of lives
and property," the premier said:
"The allies are prepared to justify
the legality of all the measures they
have taken as covered by the princi?
ples and spirit of international law
J applied to the developments of mod?
ern war. These have been carried Out
with the strictest regard to humanity,
and we are not aware of a single in?
stance of a neutral life having been
lost by reason of the allies' block?
ade."
Remarking that the German block?
ade of Great Britain had developed
long before the British order in coun?
cil of March, 1915, as shown by the
sinking of the Dutch steamer, Maria,
and the American sailing vessel, W.
P. Frye, and Germany's declaration
of a submarine blockade of the
United Kingdom on February 4, 1916,
Mr. Asqulth declared:
"It was not until March 11 that we
announced those measures against
German trade which the chancellor
now suggests were the cause of the
German submarine policy. I need not
dwell upon the flagrant violation
which has attended its execution of
the elementary rules and practices of
international law and of the common
dictates and obligations of humanity.
Up to this moment, it is being ruth?

Washington, April 10.?Investiga?
tion of recent attacks upon unarmed
merchant vessels carrying Americans
has developed such a convincing array
of evidence pointing to illegal subma?
rine operations that the United States
government has determined that the
resulting grave situation can not be
cleared up by the German note deny?
ing that a German submarine torpe?
doed the English channel steamer Sue
I sex and disclaiming blame for attacks
on other ships inquired about by Am?
bassador Gerard.
I The news that Ambassador Gerard
would be handed the German dis?
claimer had been forecast in press re
ports .and today's announcement that
I he' would receive the note tonight or
[tomorrow did not cause surprise. .
I President Wilson and Secretary Lan?
sing still are .waiting both- for the com?
munication from Berlin and for more
information from other sources. Much
I Importance Is attached to affidavits
and evidence gathered by the Ameri?
can embassy at Paris, and due to reach
New York Thursday on the liner St,
Paul.. It was* learned today, too, that
Mr. Lansing is awaiting' the outcome
of an inquiry at Paris about the case
of the liner Patria, at which a tor
[pede ie alleged to have been fired
[some time ago.
Probably the German note smd all
[the data needed for determination of
[the position of the United States will
[be In hand In time for Friday's cabinet
meeting. Until then no announce?
ment of attitude is expected. That
some definite action will follow
promptly is freely admitted, but no
I one in the confidence of the adminis?
tration will discuss what may be its
I nature. There is a general under
[standing, however, that no rupture of
> tSKlr^ the
president Will go before congress.
Count von Bornstorff, the German
? ambassador, called at the State de?
partment late today to discuss the
situation with Secretary Lansing. and
get information for his government as
to the views of the United States. His
visit was fruitless. He was with the
secretary for less than five minutes
and learned that Mr. Lansing was not
in a position to enter into a discus?
sion because he had no official in?
formation concerning the . contents of
the forthcoming German, note. The
ambassador will call again'when the
note has been received.

Once.

I German note In response to the in?
quiries of the American government
regarding the channel steamer Sussex
and the steamers Englishman,. Man?
chester Engineer, Eagle Point, and
Berwindvale, will be transmitted to
the American embassy tonight or
Tuesday morning.
The note declares, as previously
cabled, that the reports of the com?
manders of the submarines which
might possibly have been involved in
an attack on the Sussex made it abso?
lutely certain that the Sussex was not
destroyed by a German torpedo. Like?
wise Germany denies responsibility
for the sinking of the other steamers,
evidence having been adduced at the
investigation to show that no blame
1 attaches to Germany.

Berlin, April 11 (via Wireless).?
A dispatch received by the Oversees
News agency from Athens says:
"A Greek naval officer who waa an

Sussex when she was damaged by an
explosion makes a report <ef the oc?
currence in which several Greeks lout
their lives. . ,
"The officer asserts there is no rea?
son to believe the Sussex was torpedo?
ed and declares that the vessel must
have struck a mine, possibly one of
British make. According to this re?
port the Sussex car led only four Ufa
boats which were not sufficient to ac?
commodate the passengera and crow.
"The captain of the Suaaex waa kill?
ed when the explosion occurred and
the first officers on sending out a wire?
less call for help gave the wrong po?
sition of the ship. As a result of this
error, the arrival of aid was delayed
