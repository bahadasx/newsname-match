Secretary Lansing Compiles Case Against U-Boat Activi
ties fdr Submission to Berlin Note Will Be Final
Diplomatic Exchange on

-.' ' ' ', - " ' ' :'' - ' - ' ' '
Washington, April 15 Secretary Lansing continued work
today on the statement of the American case, designed to bring
the submarine question with Germany to an issue. Intimations
that the communication might already have been started on its
way were thus dispelled.
Mr. Lansing compared the affidavits on the attack on the
Sussex which arrived here last night, with information already
before the department. '; !. s-
- The President kept in touch with Secretary Lansing during
thevday and was informed of the contentsTof the affidavits re
, ceived on the St. Paul, " V ' - , ' ,
The' communication will go forward
'within the next f ew days at the latest.
The Impression, prevails here that it
will not be dispatched pending a care
ful examination of all the evidence at
hand regarding the recent submarine
cases, including affidavits in the case
. ' - of the English Channel steamer Sus
sex which arrived yesterday.
Indications are, however, that the
United States case against Germany
Is complete without the latest affidavits
and that. Germany will !be informed
that the Washington government
considers she has not fulfilled prom
ises made to this country.,
It is mde clear that the forthcom
ing communication, although intended
-. as the final word of the United States,
will still leave the -way open for Ger
many, to avoid a severance of dipto-
matio relations , .-..

PASTORSlWARN
GIRLS AGAINST
MORMONS HERE
Clergymen's Association De-.
clares Sect's Missionaries ,
Should- Be Avoided.
A wamihsr to women' and girls of
thA.nreaence In the city of mission
aries of the Mormon church has been
Issued by the; Social Conditions com
mittee of the Bridgeport Pastors' as
sociation through the chairmarii '- Dr.
Gerald H. Beard, pastor of. the Park
Street , Congregational .church. The
male missionaries of the' Mormon
church ar reported as making house-to-house
visitations particularly seek
tn g women converts. ,
The circular also contains a warning
against Syrian- Imposters and against
a 'Home" at Devon. The Pastors as
sociation has reports from the Chari
ties v Organization society,1- which
charges-the officials of this home with
unbusiness like methods, and declares
it not -worthy of support. The circular
follows: . - -
It seems Important .to warn such
women anj girls in our city as
might otherwise be imposed upon,
of the presence just now in the
! city of agents of . Mormonism.
As everyone familiar with Mormon-
practices knows,' this propa
ganda is not merely one of Teligion
which should have free play among
the many sects, but in too many ,
Cases is a xnaskvby means of which ;
'many women and girls .are be- -trayed
into a life of polygamy. No
' one should "be deceived by the ap
parently fair -"'speech;, and pious
.phrasing of these Mormon people
or v their, literature. " Their ways
have become the ways of - death
and worse than" death to nundreds
f .: Innocent - women and girls In -the
past. ' - ' "
Even where i polygamy is not ,
practised among them, a tyranny
remains that is fatal to free wo
manhood and", true religion.
: Warnings off - secondary impor- f
ta-nce, yet not without need, may
well be given also to charitably -disposed
people in - our city con- "
, cerning two ostensibly charitable
appeals that have been made from
i house, to house, or may soon be
made. One of these., is for the so
.!. called "Rescue Home for Aged La-
xdies at Devon." The character of
, this work and the -unbusiness-Iike,
methods employed are such that
does not warrant support by sen
: eible peopTe who do not wish their ;
., "benevolent gifts wasted.
The other appeal is being made
from time to time by Syrian men.
,- A number of these are traveling
through New England, soliciting ' -funds
in .the name of churches and
missions in Syria with which they
have no connection. ' In some cases
they are making- use of forged ea-
dorsements and . recommendations
from patriarchs, or . bishops, and
unless people are sure beyond -
doubt of the genuineness of such
documents, they should deny such
requests.

Board of Trade, Too, to
Withdraw Membership as
An Organization.
ANNUAL MEETING IS
CALLED FOR APR. 24.
Disparity of Assessments
, Leads to Move Towards
Re-orgahization.
. ""
f The Bridgeport Chamber of Com
merce will be reorganized on new lines
after a : year's attempt not altogether
successful to harmonize the various
civic, industrial and commercial
forces which constitute its various de
partments.1 When the annual meet
ing, on April 24 has been held, the
Manufacturers' association,1 the Bus
iness Men's association and the Board
of Trade will be, independent organi-
I zations. .N
1 Notification of the annual meeting
anu me proposal xo revise me consti
tution and by-laws of the Chamber
of Commerce was mailed to; the indi
vidual members today. ' v
The move which is believed by
those in close touch with the situa
tion to be for the best interests of the
community arid the only one which
can bring complete harmony out of
the existing conditions has not the full
sanction of the minority members but
th-fa!r seeing heads -who are actuat
ing the. body say that as an organi
sation it will be far stronger and have
greater effect upon the community
without the various independent or
ganizations., as organizations. .
When elimination of the Bridgeport
Business Men's, Manufacturers', asso
ciations and the Board of Trade has
been effected, the Chamber of Com
merce will comprise what is now
known as the civic department, in
cluding the Good Housing association,
which has already been merged. There
Will , then be- some 420 members,
pledged to the payment "of $25 annu
ally for a period of three years.
. The present1 dissatisfaction is said
to have grown out of the failure of
the .Board of Trade to pay their as
sessment of less than $ 1 per member
which was paid only by the Manufac
turers' and the Business .Men's asso
ciations. Further dissatisfaction be-.
came rife when it. was found by civic
department v members that they were
paying $25 annually against $5 pay
ments by members of the various or
ganizations which were admitted' as
a part of the Chamber of Commerce.
The situation became em'barrassing
a monthago to directors of the Cham
ber of Commerce when the Board of
Trade failed 4o send delegates to aid
in the nomination of officers for the
ensuing year. ,
At this time it was- found that the
constitution and by-laws failed to pro
vide for the emergency and the re
peated failure of the. Board of Trade
to take other than apathetic interest
in the calls, led up to ' the discus
sions of the directors which showed
the necessity for reorganization.
' Secretary George Gove, - of the
Chamber of Commerce,' in discussing
the coming election witji a reporter
for the Farmer today was most san
guine of the outcome. He :tiid: "We
must have the active support of 11
of Bridgeport. We must have full
publicity on every matter, and know
what our internal standing is. It
has been hard under past conditions
to get -one man to accept for $25 what,
another man was granted for $5. Such
a condition could not last, 'especially
when there was additional apathy on
"the part of some organizations and a
failure to meet their assessments. If
the reorganization is successful ail
will be on a parity and Bridgeport
wilt get what it sorely needs, an or
ganization that can broadly take up
improvements needed in the city. Do
not misconstrue the situation by be
lieving that because the Organizations
are withdrawn as bodies that- their
members and executives will not be
long individually to the new Cham
ber. - This '-will not be so as over 4 0
per cent, of each organization is al
ready represented individually in the
Chamber."

Coroner J. J, Phelan Finds
Danbury Man Shot to Save
Lives of Family.
VICTIM THREATENED
TO KILL WILDMANS
Father Tried to Wound
Young Man in Legs But
Charge Carried High.
That Joseph Wildman of Danbury
was justified in killing George Ander
son of the same city, his daughter's
divorced husband, is the finding made
by Coroner J. J. Phelan today. Wild
man, it appears, fired a -charge from a
shotgun into Anderson after the lat
ter? had broken into his home, threat
ening to kill his former wife and all
her family. Anderson was 39 years of
age. Wildman is 77. , -
The daughter of the aged man, Car
oline Wildman Chase, recently got a,
divorce from Anderson on the grounds
of intemperance, cruelty and neglect.
Wednesday Anderson, who had been
drinking, appeared at the house' where
his former wife was living, threatened
and abused her. , She took their little
son Charles, in her arms.- and ran to
the Wildman home near by.
Wildman locked the door when An
derson' demanded admittance and
speech with his former wife. He or
dered the infuriated man away from
his premises but Anderson began to
throw himself agains the door, shout
ing: ii -
' "JBy God, I'll g-et in and kill you ail."
The woman with her child and her
cousin, Ida Hotchkiss, who were.m the
kitchen, ran into a bedroom adjoining
and locked the door just as Anderson
broke down the rear kitchen door. An
derson was, in the. act of forcing the
door into the bedroom, when -Wildman
seized a loaded shot gun that was in
the corner of the kitchen and fired a
charge into him.
He aimed to shoot him in the legs.
intending to cripple or disable him.
but not to kill him, is the finding, of
the coroner. -Some of .the shot went
high," however, striking . Anderson in
the abdomen and inflicting- wounds
from which he died. .. The coroner says
in this act Wildman was defending, his
own life and the lives of his family.
Anderson died in Danbury hospital
tne, day ajfter the shooting.
CORPORATIONS IN
SCRAMBLE AFTER
UNSKILLED LABOR
Bridgeport prosperity is responsi
ble for a new game that is being
played by corporations, with 'laborers
as the pawns,. ,' - : '
Since the change to better conditions
here, with the" higher wages that fol
lowed, it . has heen hard for one cor
poration to keep a group of men to
do heavy work, such as digging.' The
Bridgeport Gas Light Co., the New
Haven road, and the Remington Arms
& Ammunition Co., all of which' em
ploy such workmen, ase , having an
excited game, taking laborers from
one another; y .
Asv-fast" as one company puts men
to work on a job, another lures them
away. The Remington Co., it Is ad
mitted, is gradually acquiring most
of the men by paying higher wages.
The Gas Light Co., if is said, is taking
men from the New Haven road. .
This was the gossip today following
a story on the streets that 20 helpers
and two gpjs fitters of the Bridgeport
Gas Light Co. struck last Thursday
for more wages, asking an increase
from. $1.50 to $2 . a day, in the cases
of the helpers. '
Charles M. Gerdenier, superinten
dent of the Gas Light Co. declared
today that he hadn't heard of any
strike. He said the story may have
originated from the emigration of
sme employes , to the Remington
plant. '

of the Seventh cavalry, who partici

Was a pack mule loaded with quinine
capsules, antiseptics and bandages. In
addition, the mule carried a quantity
.of coffee, which the Americans con
sidered of equal importance with drugs
in maintaining campaigning.
One. of tte results of-this campaign,
