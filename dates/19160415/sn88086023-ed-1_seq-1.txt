ANOTHER VESSEL SUNK;
AMERICAN IS RESCUED
WASHINGTON. April 15.
Conaul Skinner at London cabl-
ed Secretary Lansing that John
Harrison, a steward on the
steamer Margana Abbey, which
Has torpedoed had been rea-
cued.
Advices said the Margana Ab-
bey was attacked without warn-
log on Saturday, south of lis-
ard. The vessel did not resist 4)
the submarine.
WASHINGTON. April U, Lansing
carefully scrutinized the affidavits of
American survivors of the Sussex to
day and put final touches on the lat
est note to Germany. It was Indicated
that the note will be dispatched Mon
day Lansing agreed wth Stone's
suggestion to permit republicans to
attend the conferences over the pro.
posed note. " .
The note generally was rewarded
as the most Important yet to be sent
to Germany. It la understood that
the tentative draft outlines the po
sition that Germany must make
sweeping changes in Its submarine
policy. In no other way can she give
the assurances asked for. Lansing
'(inferred with the president this af
ternoon. Perhaps the proposition of
laying the whole matter before con
grew will be considered.
LONDON. April 15. An official
statement by the foreign office de
i land that Germany's note to Ameri
ca leases no further doubt that the
Sussex was torpedoed. Through an in
vestigation It was revealed that no
vessel In the channel, except the Sus
sex was damaged In the manner which
the submarine commander described.
It was declared that the German
Ktali merit was unjustified In that the
commander thought the ship a mine
layer Of the Arabic class.

ALLEGED PKK.lt ISY ON PARI Ol
WITNESS Is CAUSE OF
JUDGE'S ACTION.
tsecause It was openly apparent
that William Eagun. the prosecuting
witness, perjured himself in his tes
timony, Judge Flti Gerald this morn
ing dismissed the bootlegging case
against Teddy O'Nell. However, on a
charge of being drunk, he sentence'!
O'Nell to a fine of 125 or 12 days in
jail. and. when a similar charro war
' filAH nirnlnat bnn it... tuo. trava
him 40 or 20 days m Jail because of
his previous false testimony.
The caae tola morning, while It did
not prove the bootlegging charge, did
throw some light upon the manner in
which alcohol la secured. It also
showed pretty clearly that there are
many men who do not hesitate at per
jury in order to secure alcohol. There
was strong evidence that O'Nell,
Bgan and W. H. Bruner, a witness, all
perjured themselves and Deputy Dis
trict Attorney R I Keator waa pres
ent to note the evidence.
Eagan. whose home is In Hermls
ton, testified that he gave O'Nell (150
and that the latter went out and se
cured him some alcohol. O'Nell very
vehemently denied this, declaring that
Eagan himself purchased the alcohol
and returned with it to himself and
Bruner, giving them part of it. Bru
ner corroborated this story and, when
the druggist record book was brought
in and showed Eagan's signature to
an affidavit for the securing of alco
hol, it was pretty patent that he was
giving false testimony.
Eagan denied that he had purchas
ed any alcohol, even when the affida
vit was produced, declaring it was not
his signature. However, it corre
sponded almost Identically with his
signature as written on a piece of
paper. The affidavit was made in
the record book of the Tallman Druj:
Co. and Tom Brewster, prescription
clerk, was a witness. He did not,
however. Identify Eagan as the man
who secured the alcohol.
Both O'Neil and Bruner testified
to securing alcohol at the Tallman
