HOLD MAMMOTH MEET
ING IN ELKS THEATRE
Over-Flow meeting held in Street, in front of Theatre

Room.
A new bighwater mark has
been established here for big po
litical meetings by the Progrès
sives on last Tuesday evening,
«vhea the Elks Theatre was not
large enough to hold the crowd
by half. The spectacle of 1800 or
more men standing in the street,
listening to the arguments of the
speakers who had left the stage
in the theatre to address the
overflow meeting, was one calcu
lated to awaken the springs of
en'husiasm in even the most
phlegmatic citizen, if he be not an
oflice-holding Democrat. And
yet, this meeting had a doable
handicap to deal with. Hon. J.
M. Paker, the candidate, for gub
ernatorial honors, had been sum.
moned home to attend the funeral
of an uncle and consequently could
not be pi est n to meet his engage
meats at this point. This fact
pointed the way to some interest
ed parties, who were prompt in
sending out the news to the sev
eral wards, together with the fur
ther information that the meeting
had been postponed in conse
quence. Doubtless, many were
deterred from coming to this city
on that day; but what would it
have been had not this false in
formation been given out about
the holding of the meeting?
The Elks Theatre was packed
to its last inch of available space
of standing room. A thing per
haps never witnessed before was
the number of ladies compelled to
stand in the aisles through the
speaking. The doors and .win
dows were crowded with standing
men. The balcouies were packed
to the rails. The stage itself
held a fair sized audience for an
ordinary occasion. When the
band, which had been piayiDg in
front of the building, came in and
took its place in the orchestra pit,
many thought the house was full;
but when the speakers aud their
attendants came in the wonder
was, "where will they be jam.

Hon. J. D. Walet, of the 4th
Ward, called the meeting to order
in a brief speech of well chosen
words, setting the key of enthusi
asm for the evening. He then
called npon Judge L. O. Hacker
to receive the gavel and to pre
side over the deliberations of the
evening.
After expressing his thanks for
the honor thos conferred, the
Chairman announced Judge M. T
Gordy, of Vermilion, as the first
speaker. Judge Gordy showed
his familiarity with existing poli
tical and financial conditions m
this state, a result of Boss Buie,
by the ease in which be quoted
astoanding figures. He paid his
rtspectato the primary election
law in glowing terms, declaring it
was conceived and born in fraud,
calculated to perpetuate the Dem
ocratic party. In reviewing the
state's finances he called attention
to the fact that with the passing
years the state's bpnded debt has
been growing, notwithstanding
the general increase of taxation.
The last four years has added an
other $2.000,000 to a previous
$11,000,000 State debt. This
tendency must be altered or it
TYPOGRAPHICAL
REASONS FOR
WOMAN'S BALLOT.
The Typographical Union of
Atlanta, Ga , favors the mufiici
pal vote for Atlanta women.
Their resolutions were presented
to Council by three delegates,
William S. Wier, N. H. Kirkpat
rick and W. C. Caraway. In
part they «ay: "The women of
Atlanta represent a great moral
and intelligent class, whose lives
are spent in the care and better
meat of the raee," and that "we
men having no claim to a God
given right to deny to this most
dutiful and conscientious class,
the privilege of the ballot which
we know safeguards oar own
lives and property, would give to
women the strongest weapon for
their own protection and for the
protection of the home and fam

negro problem were questions
given attention
At this juncture the 8th Ward
transparency was brought in and
placed upon the stage. A chart
was also exhibited, showing "the
Boosters fate."
Mr Rosin, ot New Orleans, was
next introduced. He came up to
fill Mr. Parker's place ou the ev
ening's program Many ot his
auditors who were unacquainted
with ring rule methods were hor

who did not cringe and crawl
seeking the approbation ot the
bosses. He paid a splendid trU)

the gallant fight he is making for
the spirit of an unbossed e.ecto.
rate.
Mr. E.*S. Broussard, the Pro
gressive candidate for the office
of Lieutenant Governor, was the
next, speaker introduced. Iu the
opening of his address he called
attention to the fact that certain
Interested parties had used the
telephone iu notifying others in
the eouutry that the Parker meet
ing in New Iberia had been post
poned. Not withstanding this ef
fort on the part of the opposition,
it had been his privilege to ad
dress (a few minutes betöre) fully
1800 people, the overflow of this
meeting. He declared that the
Independent movement in this
state was rapidly gaining force
and momentum, like a great wave
of resistless power. The people
have set their faces for reforms
and they will have them. The
fee system is demoralizing, it
must go. The Piogiessive party
has adopted a clear cut platform
and the Democrats declare that
the Progressives will be fool
enough to carry out their pledges
enough to carry out their pledges
if elected.
Judge Howell, of Thibodeaux,
was the next speaker introduced
In the course of his remarks he
called attention to the fact that
MeEuery, Gibson, and Judge
White, honored sons of Louisiana,
bad found it necessary in the
course of their careers to vote iu
the interest of the people of the
state of Louisiana and against
the fixed rale of the Democratic
party. The present revolt against
the shortcomings of the party is
not without its precedent The

Mr. Harry FiTzpatriok, of New
Orleans, opened his speech by ad
dtessing, "Mr. Chairman and the
unbossed men and women of Ibe
ria." While his remarks were
liberally spiced with droll witl
oisms, they were heavily freight
ed with a recounting of the ills of
the Democratic party of this state.
His speech was well received and
eattiusiastically applauded.

"If they (the 'ring' men) want

bie this Tuesday week they are
going to get it and get more than
they are looking for," Joseph
Markey, chairman of the registra
1 1 on committee of the Parker cam
paign, said Tuesday night at
meeting of Parker workers
throughout the city. Ward ana
precinct captains and the men
who are to represent Mr. Parker
in the polls as commissioners and
clerks, attended the meeting.
More than 400 were present.
Mr Markey was the principal
speaker at the meeting, which
was held for the purpose of bav
nig a thorough understanding
among the Parker leaders as to
how to proceed election day. He
strongly advised the Parker men
to stand their grouud and call er
ery bluff iu the confident assur
ance that the Iudepeudent Demo
cratio headquarters was prepared
to back them up to the limit
His attitude was cheered lustily.
"Before the day is over the
'ring' is going to be eating out of

serted. " I bis is the first time iu

"Notwithstanding the wild
statements of the opposition
press, John M. Parker is coining
to the city wuh a majority larger
by far than any of us even hoped
for a month ago," Col. Polk said.
He expressed confidence that Mr
Parker would carry Rapides par

Mr. Peterman stressed the faot

right to fair treatment and a
square deal. He asked those in
