Birthday Party at Wm. Harring
ton's Where Ripe Old Age
Predominates.
In honor of William- Harrington's
birthday anniversary last Tuesday
nineteen members of the G. A. R. and
W. K. C. gathered at his home on the
West Side to assist him in celebrating
the event. Of the gathering assembled
there were nine ladies whose combined
ages amountad to 591) years, and the
ages of ten Grand Army veterans
present amounted to ('0 years. It is
against newspaper propriety to venture
on the delicate subject of a lady's age,
so only a list of the gentlemen follow:
Fow ley Steel aged 83 years
I.. C. Madison aged 70 years
George liowen aged 77 years
John Cummins..... aged 73 years

Uncle Sam trying to act as a peace

as the umpire in a ball game between

A person shouldn't be considered a
pessimist merely because he finds that
the opposing administration has done
everything wrong, nor an optimist be
cause he can see nothing wrong in the
action of the members of his own party.

Boost for East Jordan
and Michigan
When you buy goods at home you have the opportunity of see
ing what you are buying and if everything is not just right the diffi
culty can be adjusted promptly. and satisfactorily without expense or
loss of time.
It is to be regretted that occasionally a merchant is shortsighted
an'd does not appear willing to render ihe right kind of service to his
patrons. Such a policy is inexcusable and such merchants are a dis
grace to their community and a hinderance to their town.
BUT! There are also altogether too many consumers who are
running bills from tnirty days to one year at their dealer's expense
and annoyance, often times forcing him into bankruptcy, and during
that same period are sending hundreds of miles away without even
giving the local man an opportunity to bid upon the order.
There is not a drop of red blood in such an individual s veins or
a spark of patriotism in his make-up. His community would be better
off without him.
We once heard a man excuse himself for ordering goods of a
mail order house in another state by saying that the local dealer was
holding him up, yet upon investigation learned his dealer was worth
only a few hundred dollars while the mail-order house was worth
several millions, so evidently had not held up as many as the other
fellow.
We ascertained by asking a few questions that this particular
person had run a bill with his dealer for over six months and yet was
complaining because the merchant could not quote him as low a price
on a small order on a six month's credit basis as the mail-order house
would on a good sized order, cash in advance. The home merchant
was a tax-payer and a part of the town that made this party's
property more valuable while the mail-order house never paid a dol
lar's worth of taxes in Michigan, but on the other hand was drawing
upon the resources of the town and the State, making them poorer
instead of richer.
Shame on any person who would even listen to such an argument
without making a protest. Shame on the fellow who makes it a
hundred times more.
Michigan folks should get together and work hand in hand for the
advancement of their own prosperity. Common sense teaches it is
the proper thing to do.

RKMOVAL NOTICE

A Delightful Dcscrf
Is well worth getting acquainted with
because it will serve a company of 30
people at a cost of sixty cents. It re
quires one quart of milk, one pint of
cream, two cups of sugar, one pound
of dates, and the juices of one lemon
and one orange. Wash and chop dates
and blend with the milk, then add
cream, sugar and lastly the fruit juices.
Pack in ice and salt and freeze. Could
anything be simpler?

The large diplomas of honor for one
year of perfect attendance are in de
mand now for the schools closing at the
end of seven months. Parents should
be careful not to let spring fever or the
blue bird interfere with the attendance
record at the last of the vear.
Several school boards have issued
invitations to the state inspector for
standard schools to meet with them
this spring. This does not bind them
in any way. They merely wish to know
where they stand.

ALONG THE FIRING LINE
Democratic State Committee of New
Jersey would as soon be hanged for an
old sheep as a lamb. At its recent
meeting, not content with indorsing
Wilson, the Committee went on record
in approval of the Underwood Tariff
Bill which is declared to have "sub
stantially contributed toward the pro
motion of vastly improved times which
are observable on every hand." We
hereby offer a prize of one large red
apple for each and every instance of
'vastly improved times" to which the
Underwood tariff has "substantially
contributed."
Debating the Shields water power
bill in the Senate, Mr. Nowlands of
Nevada tried and succeeded to
demonstrate that the Democratic ma
jority in Congress has persistently
legislated in defiance of the platform
pledges of its party. This is not in the
nature of the news, nor was it really
illuminating to the debate. But it is
refreshing to have an eminent Demo
crat stand up in either branch of Con
gress to admit it. The Nevada states
man was not content, with showing that
his party had violated the pledges of its
platform of four years ago, but he
quoted from earlier Democratic plat
forms to show that violation of cam
paign pledges is a Democratic habit.
Fortunately, the country has no inten
tion of giving the Democrats further op
portunity to display their tendency in
this direction.
Nebraska's Secretary of State has
turned down a complaint that Bryan is
not entitled to enter the Democratic
primaries because he is not a Democrat
So far, so good. Now that it has been
officially determined that Bryan is a
Democrat, cannot some method be de
vised to determine whether he is a Wil
son man?
Dr. Wiley says Tie prescribed sugar
for the Harvard football team and Yale
has not won a game since. Yet the
prescription of sugar which Woodrow
Wilson's administration has just had to
take will not have the same effect.
Every schoolboy knows the axiom,
The wnole is equal to the sum of its
parts. But Mr. Underwood evidently
forgot his boyhood training when he
drew his renowned "comDetitive"
tariff bill. That measure provides for
a ten per cent duty on cattle, and lets
in free all the parts that make up cattle
The importer of a live cow must pay
the ten per cent ad valorem on Bossy,
but the bones, hide, flesh, hoofs, blood,
horns, milk and hair of cows are on the
free list. The same inconsistency exists
in certain provisions regarding machin
ery. Some machines pay duty, but all
of their parts may be brought in free.
Did Mr. underwood regard a cow or a
steer as a piece of machinery or what?
Haying dilly-dallied and delayed con
sideration of legislation in every pos
sible way, the Democrats in the Senate
now plan to introduce a cloture rule to
stifle debate, and Senator Gore is to
introduce such a rule. This is for the
purpose of relieving a congestion which
has been caused by their own delays.
The rule will prevent such careful con
sideration of bills as might otherwise
have been possible, and there has been
no disposition on the part of Repub
licans to block legislation. This is
Democratic method of going about the
country's business used chiefly on the
House side procrastinate, then cut off
debate but which appears to have
found its way into the Senate. They
threatened cloture at the beginning of
the session, the plan was killed in their
caucus, and again makes its appear
ance. Seasickness is the result of fol
lowing the Democratic changes of mind

Washable Toys arc the Safest
Childish ailments are often difficult
to account for, and even doctors are
puzzled at times. But in cases like
this one medical man, with children of
his own, always asks: "Where are the
children's toys?" Then often the pro
blem is solved, and the case can easily
be diagnosed as one of mild poisoning
Most toys find their way into the
children's mouths, the gaudy paint is
sucked off, and trouble naturally fol
lows. Some toys, wooden or tin trum
pets, for example, have the paint actu
ally on the mouthpiece or within an
inch of it. India rubber toys are fa
vorites, but they should be uncolored
as the paint becomes brittle, breaks off,
and a piece may be swallowed and
cause severe stomach trouble.
Washable toys are always the best
"OBSERVATIONS"
By Our Man About Town
He was only a young man surely
not more than twenty-two or twenty
three years old, yet he was at once
recognized as a "tramp."
He approached me while I was stand
ing on the platform at the depot, and
asked for a match. Given the match,
he thanked me in such a way that I was
agreeably surprised, and, seeing that
he was not anxious to get away, I decid
ed to work into a conversation with him
and, if possible, learn for my own satis
faction just why he was a tramp.
"No," he answered me, "I do not
consider myself a tramp, although I do
ook like one and I imagine that is what
am in the eyes of all I meet."
I told the young fellow that people
now-a-days consider every idle, ragged
stranger a tramp and asked how he had
fallen into his misfortune if he did not
wish himself to be classed with other
tramps.
"Well, sir," he told me, I guess I
have only myself to blame, but really I
am not a bad sort. I left my little home
town a few years ago and for a time
worked in different cities. But I start
ed traveling in the summer, found it
pleasant, and it's a fact that "tramping
as the world calls it i mot such a hard
lot. Of course I've been pretty hungry
at times, and I've slept on bare floors,
but I consider the experience worth it.
am getting to see the United States,
and I probably never would have seen
it had I stayed at my home town. I
work now and then and very rarely
have to beg. Sometime, and soon, I
think, I am going to find work, prove
myself capable, and climb to a respect
able position."
Asked if he thought the average so-
called tramp was like him he said he
did not know, but that he imagined all
of them rather liked it, as he, at least,
had always been able to find work
when he really wanted it.
