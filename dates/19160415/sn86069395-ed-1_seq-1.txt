Germany's Quibble in Sussex
Matter Not Backed
By Facts.
London, April 14. Before Verdun
the infantry has remained inactive
and only to the sectors to the north
west, embracing bill 30-1 and the front
from Le Mort Homme to Cumeries,
has there been heavy work by the ar
tillery. Burlin reports that unfavora
ble weather is hindering infantry op
erations. .
The Germans in the Lake Narocz
and Ikskull bridgehead1 positions on
the Russian front have made attempts
to advance. According to Petrograd
they were repulsed.
In Asiatic Turkey the Turks have
delivered powerful counter attacks in
the Caucasus region against import
ant positions recently captured from
them by the Russians. Their at
tempts failed according to Petrograd.
Five .additional vessels have met
with disaster as a result of mines or
submarines. The British steamers
Robert Adamson and Angus and the
British bark Inverlyon have been
sunk by submarines, while a Danish
vessel named Dorothea has been sunk
by a mine and the Dutch steamer
Colombia damaged by a mine.
When asked to give an official view
on Germany's note to the American
government concerning the Sussex,
the foreign office today made the fol
lowing statement to the associated
press, based on information obtained
from admiralty officials:
"There is no resemblance between
the Arabic class and the Sussex. The
Germans are condemned by their own
statement, which says tliat the subma
rine attacked a ship at 3:55 p. m., the
exact time at which the Sussex was
attacked.
"The submarine commander also
reports that the fore part of the ship
was blown off. No ship but the Sus
sez has suffered damage in any way
resembling this. That the sketch of
the vessel made by the commander of
the submarine does not resemble the
picture of the Sussex, said to have
been taken from an English newspa
per, will hardly cause surprise."
REPAIRS ARE
COMPLETED
Flats Refurnished and Are
Now Ready For Use
Again.
The repairs on tho interior of Mrs.
F. C. Hillo's property, corner Main
and Eleventh streets, which was bad
ly damaged by fire early in January,
have been completed and the flats
have been refurnished throughout.
Several rooms were so badly dam
aped bv the flames that the repairs
amounted to almost a rebuilding of
them, while others were more or less
damaged, causing a general overhaul
t(t of them all. Tho rooms aro now
elegantly furnished and ready for
occupancy. 1 he repairs on the build-
IniT. and the cost of now carncts and
rugs, together with paint, papering,
etc., amounted to aoout suou. About
203 bolts of wall paper were used in
repairing.

Tobacco Season Closing With
General Air of Op

Loose Floor Averages For
Week Highest of the
Season.
Higher and higher the average
price of tobacco has crept until it
stands this week at $7.22 on nearly
700.CD0 pounds. It was a better week
than last week in both receipts and
prices. The unfortunate part is that
nearly all of the crop has been sold
and tho growers are not getting the
benefit of the high prices. It has,
however, settled the question of the
191G,crop and everybody is preparing
to plant to the limit of plants, under
the belief that the prices next fall will
be higher than ever before.
Week ending April 14, 191G, is as
as follows:
Receipts for week 0 Hhds. .

Effect.
Paris, April 11. A corporal in the
French army lived for a year with a
piece of shrapnel buried in the right
ventricle cf his heart. This was later
removed and the soldier completely
recovered.
This case, unprecedented in medi
cal annals, was reported to the acad
emy of sciences Wednesday. The
corporal was wounded September 7,
1914. Several months later the sol
dier was taken to a hospital and
operated on for appendicitis.
Cardiac trouble developed while he
was convalescing and a nulioscopic
examination located the shrapnel in
his heart. The projectile, weighing
10 grammes, was removed on Sep
tember 0, 1915.

Town Held By Carranza
Fires Upon Americans
Passing Through.
FUNSTON HAS FREE HAND
May Seize Railroads and
Adopt Slogan, "AH Greas
ers Look Alike."
Washington, April 14. American
troops in Mexico have had their first
battle with the natives at the moment
Gen. Carranza is urging their with
drawal. On Wednesday night, while Gen.
Carranza's note wis on its way to
Washington, troopers of the Seventh
cavalry under Maj. Tompkins were
fired upon in Parral, a Villa strong
hold in western Chihuahua; were pur
sued to the suburbs while the Car
ranza garrison took a doubtful part in
the affray, and were attacked again
during the night.
Complete information regarding the
losses to the American troops or to
the Mexicans had not reached Wash
ington tonight. Secretary Bakor in
formed President Wilson that a brief
dispatch to the war department said
that, according to unofficial reports,
one American cavalryman, was killed
and that the troopers used a machine
gun against tho Mexicans.
MAY USE RAILROADS BY FORCE.
Mr. Baker announced later that he
had ordered Gen. Funston to take any
steps that might be necessary to pre
vent further trouble. When asked
whether this might moan the enforced
use of the Mexican railroads for tho
movement of soldiers and supplies,
he said Gen. Funston was on the
ground and would act as any emer
gency required. The secretary ex
pressed the hope, however, that the
trouble at Parral was purely local and
did not presage further difficulties.
Gen. Carranza, directing his em
bassy here to point out that the clash
proved his contention that the pres
ence of the American troops in Mexi
co is leading to a situation which
threatens to go beyond his control,
telegraphed that "many deaths had
occurred on both sides." Foreign
Minister Aguilar in a dispatch sent
before that from Gen. Carranza said
one American trooper was killed and
several civilians were wounded.
Consul Garcia, the Carranza agent
at El Paso, wired the embassy that
j "several persons were killed on both
sides." His dispatch added that
when the American troopers ontored
j Parral, "the people protested and, it
appears, the garrison did also."
MEXICAN STATEMENTS CONTRA
I DICTORY.
I This latter statement is in direct
contradiction to the dispatch of Cnr
I ranzn and Auuilar. which declared tli
'Carranza troops attempted to hold
back the Mexican mob.
Gen. Funston made clear in hisdis
j patches that Parral is so physically
situated that it is difficult to pass
around it and almost necessary to
pass through it to proceed south.
That probably was responsible for the
cavalrymen entering the town and of
ficials noted that all the Mexican rcr
ports agreed that they retired at once
when the local officials nrotcsted
against their presence. Tho war de
partment investigation will clear u
! how they came to enter.
