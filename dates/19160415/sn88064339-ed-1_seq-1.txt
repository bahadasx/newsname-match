Judge 1 3. hDubuisen, after delib Mr. Jhn M. Parker. regiotre4 a a
remn as a candidater on the Proigree Prolresmive vOter l t to n nalskn
inDemocrat who took part tn te Dome
live ticket for the reason that he had cratic primary to vote for him h hi
registered as a Dempcrat and had par- laskin thoem to perpotato a Wiseh of
ticipated in tho Democratic primary, fait-te Ido that which nIr would not do.
The Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana gave de
liverance, in an unanimous decision in State vs. Michel, 121
La. Page 387, to the principle which governs the primary
election. The Court declared:
"The voter, by participating in a primary, impliedly promises and
hinds himself in honor to support the nominee, and a statute which
exacts from him an express promise to that effect pdds nothing to his
moral obligation and does not undertake to add anything to his legal
obligation. The man who cannot be held by a promise which he knows
he has impliedly given will not be held by an ex rews romise."
cDemor nts who votud in the recent primary thereby confirmed their choice
of party atfiliation, alredady subscriled to by them before the Registrar of
Voters. if they had so desired, they could, according to the registration law,
have changed their party affiliation.
The Judges of the Sulneme Court of iouisiana have unanimously declared
that the voter who participatesd in a rirY by so doing impliedly promises
and is in honor bound to support the nominees of such primary. But it does
not reqcuire a judicial mind to determine the rectitude of a personal matter so
self.evident.
It is, however, lsurprisi that the moral obligation thus resting on Dem.
j wrati: v(otrs should he disregarded by a candidate for the high offiw e of
S(;vernor of Iouisiana and an appeal made to them to disavow such an
Wouldt ietlothn M. Parker fulfill a moral obligation? If he would not,
woultdin he be the right kind of ta man to bue Governor of Louisiana?
Should Mr. Parker ask you to (co something which he would consider it
beneath himself to (10)?
When Mr. Parker apelIals to the voters who participated in the Democratic
iprimary to vote for him he thus asks them to violate not only their party
allcgianc'e, hut to) do something, which, in the language of the Supreme Court,
he "bindD himoself in honor" nopt to (.
If ni)oal b ,ligations are not binding in political matters Ton your part. why
should they o\ bIinding on his? If he should be elected Governor, why should
y)u expect his pro',mises to Ihe fulfilled?
Can purity inl plo(liti(E he Ipreached by an appeal for double-dealing and
flagrant disregard f carndinal principles of honesty in political matters?
'rliet' questions are forced before us by Mr. Parker's course in this
campailgn. The vcoters of the State cannot, in justice to themselves, leave
them unanswered. let yyoiur conscience be your guide,
