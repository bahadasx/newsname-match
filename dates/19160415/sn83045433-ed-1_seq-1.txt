WILL MAKE NO THREATS
To Clearly Show, However,
Only Change in Policy Wil
Prevent Diplomatic Break.
CASE WILL HINGE ON REPLY
Teuton's Good Faith Will Be Directly
Impuned in &Eidece to Be Sub
nutted in 65 Counts.
President Wilson's last warning to Ger
many on the submarine issue will be
cabled to Berlin early next week. The
communication embodying it was ap
proved by the Cabinet yesterday and will
be shown to members of the Senate For
eign Relations Committee and the Iouse
Foreign Affairs Committee probably on
Monday. It will contain sixty-five spec"
flc indictments of Germany's Illegal sub
marine warfare which have occurred
since the sinking of the Lusitania.
No threat on the part of the United
States and no further holdin: to "strict
accountability" will be contained in the
note according to the best advices here
but officials say it will clearly show that
the maintenance of diplomatic relations
between the two governments from now
on will depend upon modified rules of sub
marine warfare and Germany's good faith
In adhering to them.
At End of Rpe.
The President realizes that the end of
the diplomatic rope has been reached. le
knows that in taking his present stand
he is burning his bridges behind him and
leaving no alternative but a diplomatic
break, with its threatened consequences,
In case Germany falls to sgee to the
prinebles for whicb he is contending.
This is why the President desires that
the Foreign Agairs Committee of the
Senate and the leaders in Congress be
given an opportunity to consult with him
before he takes action.
News that the members of the Commit
tees on Ioreign Affairs were to be called
in consultation with the President led
to many extravagant reports after yes
terday's Cabinet meeting. It was first
reported that drastic action would be
taken within forty-eight hours and that
a diplomatic break was considered in
evitable. Simultaneously, unjustified ru
mors were in circulation that Ambassa
dor Gerard had been recalled from Ber
lIn and that Count von Bernstorff was
to be handed his passports.
Will Wait on Reply.
More conservative counsel prevailed
later and members of the President's
Calnet themselves allayed alarm by
stating that the present proposed action
was an Intermediary step and did not
necessarily bar Germany from making
eleventh hour concessions which might
still adjust matters. Upon Germany's re
ply to the present communication and
not upon the present communication it
self would depend whether or not friend
ly relations between the two govern
ments were to be maintained, they ex
plained. They would not say whether
the communlaction would specifically call
for a reply, but Intimated that Germany
would doubtlens desire to make one.
The utmost secrecy is being maintain
ed as to the exact form the communica
tion will take. Senators and Congress
men who attempted to extract informa
tion from the White House or from mem
bers of the Cabinet failed in their en
deavors.
To Impogn Geo4 Faith.
Germany's good faith in dealing with
the United States, which will be indi
rectly impugned in the array of evidence
contained in the communication, will be
judged henceforig by the recurrence
or absence of illegal submarine attacks
on merchantmen carrying Americans. Au
tomatically, recurrence will mean that
the President's trust in Germany's good
faith has ended.

City today reported the arrival
of Gen. Venustiano Carransa
in Mexico City. After being
fomally received by the popu
lace, Casranza went to a private
house where be rested and
changed his attire. He then
proceeded to the national pal
ace.
Gen. Carranza left Mexico
City eighteen months ago and
this is his first visit since that
time. Triumphal arches had
been erected to greet the first
chief, the message said.
Private messages asserted
that he refused to pass bena.
the arches. A year agogte
similar arches were crCd and.
Carranza failed to go to the
city, bombs were discovered
secreted in the decoration ready
to be exploded when he should
ride beneath.

Secial to The Washingte. Herald.
New York. April 14.-Clews furnished by
a search of Dr. Walter . Scheele's lab
oratory In Hoboken, where fire bombs for
the damaging of merchantmen are said
to have been assembled, led the Fed
eral and the local pollee authorities to
believe that out of the arrest of eight
Germans in the Aro bobb- ease may come
still more startling revelations concern
Ing destructive work in munition and
powder factories in this country, com
monly ascribed to German secret agents.
Neither the Department of Justice nor
Capt. Tunney. of the bomb squad, whose
remarkably persistent detective work
caused the arrests in the ship fire mys
teries, would make any additional charge
today against Dr. Scheele, who has van
ished, nor would any one admit the de
tails of the confessions made by five of
the eight men under arrest, or tell of
the vast amount of evidence dug up on
the Friedrich der Grosse, in Dr.
Scheele's laboratory, and in the homes
of the other men placed under arrest.
It was learned, however, that the po
llee forces of New York and Hoboken had
found a great amount of startling mate
rial in Dr. Scheele's laboratory. Dr.
Scheele's professed work in the laboratory
was the making of fertilizer. Since the
arrest of his assistants, it has been
learned, first, that he used the laboratory
to mix oil with fertiliser as a means of
smuggling it into Germany, and secondly.
to assemble fire bombs to be placed, it
is charged, on ships through the aid of
Capt. Otto Wolpert and Capt. Eno Bode,
both connected with the Hamburg-Amer
ican Steamship Company.
The materials found by the detectives
today suggested that Dr. Scheele's ac
tivities were even more extensive and
mystericus. In the first place, a large
amount of smokeless powder was found
stored away in the laboratory, presum
ably owned by the New Jersey Agricul
tural and Chemical Company. Also there
were many different sorts of acids and
components of explosives other than the
murlatic and sulphuric acids said to have
been used in the manufacture of the liquid
fire bombs.

San Antonio, Tex.. April 14.-Gen. Fun

which puts a new aspect on the attack
upon the American troops at Parra
Wednesday afternoon. showing that Car
ransa soldiers led in the attack, and were
assisted by civilians., who Joined in the
attack declared to be unwarranted and
unjustified in every sense.
Two American soldiers paid the pen
alty and between forty and fifty Mexi
cans fell victims to American bullets,
a number of whom are said to be Car
ransa soldiers.
About 150 American troops were camped
outside the town and had made no at
tempt to enter or cross through the set
tlement. A detachment of about forty
troopers was sent Into Parral to purchase
supplies for the command, and were at
tacked by Mexican soldiers and civil
ians. many of them eniping from be
hind walls and buildings at the Ameri
cans.
The forty Americans retreated to the
encampment outside the town, and were
hotly pursued by the Mexicans. who were
met by American reiaformemnt with a
machine gun. Nearly a half hundred
Mexicans wa. isUfd before they could
retreat back to Parr=l.
t. s. C.a.= Reperts Fight.
United States Consul Leteher, at Chi
huahua City, telegraphs Gen. Bell, at
El Paso. a report of the Parral fight re
ceived there, as follows:
"Twenty-five unarmed American sol
diers entered Parral to buy supplies.
Were fired upon by Carransa troops and
citizens. Two Americans were killed.
They retreated to a camp outside of
Parral and returned the fire of Mexicans.
Forty Mexicans killed. Machine guns
were used. No figures on wounded.'
El Paso. Tex., April 14.-American
forces., when fired upon by the civilian
citizens of Parral on Tuesday, were
unarmed. Only a small part of the
force had Just reached that point,
presumably the command of Maj.
Frank Tompkins, Thirteenth Cavalry,
had entered the city. and these had
left their arms with the main com
mand on the outskirts of the town.
Both reports agreed in the declara
tion that the main body of the Amer
ican troops remained outside the city.
The official report said that forty
unarmed American troopers were rid
ing into the town to buy provisions
when fired on. A dispatch to a min
ing company said two unarmed mes
sengers from the American army rode
into the city to look for dispatcheas
and were fired on, the arrival of the
Americans in the outskirts of the
city having previously excited the
people.
Bell Credits Both Reports.
Gen. George Bell, Jr.. credited both
these reports, declaring that probably
the messengers rode In advance of
the other forty men. Both reports
agreed that when the )rexeaas fired
they killed one of the men in advance
and that the other Americans retreat
ed, followed by the excited Mexicans.
The troops in camp hearing the firing
rushed up with machine Ufan and
rifles, and soon put the xicans to
flight.
Official bulletins in Juarez today
reciting the occurtence said Carransa
military did not take part in the
trouble, and dianlased it as "-a difft

Mown yesterday afternoon that he is

It is understood that a formal reply

rithin the next day or two. Explaining
hat he did not regard the representa

anstituting a demand for the immediate

adieated a willingness to give such as

Parther Details Seunt.
Every possible efort is being made
my thp State and War Department to get
urtbr details through American seuroes
onCerning the fight at Parral. Secretary
taker admitted last night that not only
as Gen. Pershing failed to respond to
he request for infornaton, but not a
cord has come through of any kind from
he troops in Mexico since April 10 when
eG. Pershing reported the list of Amern
an soldiers wounded in the first engage
sent with Villistas at Guerrero on
darnif 3.
Whether Pershing. who was last re
orted as being pell up with the ad
ance columns, has been cut off, or
is line of communications has been
ut. or whether his failure to answer
he repeated inquiries from Washing
on is due to a break down in his
wireless outfits are all questions which,
igure in the anxious speculation of
riffielals here.
Washington is keyed up. to a high
itch over the developments. Secre
ary Lansing himself admitted yester
lay afternoon that the situation is be
oming increasingly dangerous in the
.bsence of any understanding with the
arransa government, and indicated
hat he appreciated. The possibility that
he feeling in Mexico may at any time
ret beyond the control-of the de facto
rovernment.
Surprise Over statement.
At the same time he denied a re
sort that he had instructed Special
(gent James Linn Rodgers to reopen
togettatlons with Carransa in the,
tope of staving oft trouble. He de
lared that no instructions of any
tind have been sent to Mr. Rodgers.
Who is at Mexico City awaiting the
ormal entry into that city of Car
ansa and his cabinet, who are re
ported to have arrived in the out
kirts of the capital.
There was considerable surprise at

hat he was prepared to accept the

hat the time had arrived "to treat
