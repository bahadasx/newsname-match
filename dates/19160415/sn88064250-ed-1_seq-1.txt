STIRRING ADDRESS
MADE BY J. Y. SANDERS
EX- GOVERNOR DELIVERS A MASTERPIECE IN FAVOR OF THE
GRAND OLD DEMO CRATIC PARTY BE -
FORE LAR GE CROWD
,n Before the largest crowd that has
iy gathered in the courthouse during
the present campaign to listen to
Democratic speakers Ex-Governor
ne Jared Y. Sanders, personal friend
ly, and adviser of Ruffin G. Pleasant,
n- an ardent supporter of the Demo
l- cratic cause, delivered the most
m eloquent address in behalf of De
of mocracy ever heard by the voters
'- of St. Landry on last Monday night.
sh The spacious courtroom was
crowded to its utmost capacity long
s before the Democratic orators made
Df their appearance and when Gov.
at Sanders, A. J. Poterie and Congress
at man Ladislas Lazaro arrived in the
Id fight their way through the en
)r thusiastic crowd, which cheered the
3- well known orators when they ap
)r peared on the scene.
;e Hon .John W. Lewis, President of
s; the First Ward Democratic Club,
n called the meeting to order and as
10 preliminary remarks stated that he
S. wished to give out some informa
d tion concerning the condition in St.
;s Landry parish, he stated that= the
a speakers had been to Prarie Basse
de Grand Coteau and Coulee Croche
r. reported ~otbeds of the." Bull
y Moosers, and that the crowds which
attended the meetings were larg'e as
well as enthusiastic. Mr. Lewis
n said in part: "Democrats of St.
Landry, I want to tell you that
n John M. Parker will not carry
o St. Landry parish by one thousand
e votes, neither will he carry it by
a 600 nor 400--he won't carry the
t parish at all."
s When Mr. Lewis made this
e startling announcement the seven
hundred throats in the audience
Sshouted themselves almost hoarse.
Mr. Lewis stated that he would
rather ride in the Democratic band
wagon with Jared Y: Sanders, whom
he had always fought politically,
t than in a palatial car with the Bull
Mooser.
The speaker then introduced Sen
ator Leon S. Haas as permanent
chairman of the meeting. Senator
Haas spoke earnestly in a few
words, in favor of Democracy, af
ter which he introdriced Mr. Por
terie, a young lawyer of Avoyelles
varish .
Mr. Poterie is very eloquent and
made a deep and favorable impres
sion upon his hearers. He pictured
John M. Parker as a political trai
tor, having forsaken Governor Hall,
right after the inauguration four
years ago; he reviewed the Progres
sive candidate for governor's poli
tical history of the past twenty
years, stating that Mr. Parker had
voted the Republican ticket in
1896 and 1900, had failed to' vote in
1904 because he had not voted his
poll tax and in 1908 voted for Taft,
the Republican candidate for pres
ident and in 1912 bolted the Re
publican party and followed Mr.
Roosevelt into the Progressive
party, voting for Roosevelt for the
presidency.
Mr. Poterie pictured Gov. Hall as
the Robert E. Lee of the 1912 cam
paign and Mr. Parker as the Stone
wall Jackson, but after the battle
was won however that great strage
dian had fled into the camp of the
enemy, unlike the real Stonewall
Jackson, and had left his chieftan
to reap the fruits of the battle
alone.
The next speaker to be intro
duced was Congressman Lazaro of
St. Landry parish. Dr. Lazaro ap
nealed to the people to stand by
the Democratic party on April 18th
because, he said, if the party nom
inees were successful at the polls
on next Tuesday it would mean that
the Wilson administration had been
approved by the people of Louis
iana. whereas, if Parker was elect
ed over Pleasant. the friend and
supporter of that great Democratic
leader. Woodrow Wilson. it would
mean that the National Democratic
administration had been repudiated
and the message would click over
the wires to Oyster Bay. informing
the Bull Moose head that Louis
iana had been converted to a Pro
gressive State and that the Solid
Souf.h had been broken.
Representative Lazaro told his
hearers of the laws enacted by the
Wilson administration: he told of
the Smith-Lever bill, of the Pana
ma tolls bill, of the rural credits
law, of the Merchant Marine bill
which will soon be passed and o'
the bill, which will soon be sub
mitted and which will be adopted
into law, whereby the levees of the
Mississippi would be controlled by
the United States Government.
The speaker averted to the fact
that some of the Parkerites have
severely criticised him for com
ing to Louisiana to defend the
patty which had repeatedly ýaon
ored him by election to office. He
said that he was only responding
to the call of duty and that he was
asking the voters of the Seventh
District to vote conscientiously on
the governorship, to the best in
terests of the state, adding at the
same time that he hought if they
would do this they would surely
vote for Ruffin G. Pleasant, the
friend of Woodrow Wilson, as
against John M. Parker, the friend
and supporter of JTheodroe Roose
velt.
f Ex-Governor J. Y. Sanders was
), the next speaker introduced and
,s shouts of "Go to it, J. Y." the ex
e chief executive officier of Louis
- iana launched into an eloquent ad
L. dress on behalf of the "Grand Old
e Democracy." Many who attended
e last Monday night's meeting stated
e that it was thp best political speech
I ever delivered by J. Y. Sanders,
1 which means that it is the best
p speech delivered in the courthouse
B in many years.
Mr. Sanders first started by say
t ing that he cared naught who was
J governor, whether it was Smith,
Brown or Black, but he was very
much interested in the party affili
ation of the governor. He stated
that Ruffin G. Pleasant was elected
governor on the 31st of last Au-.
i gust when the proposed constitu
tional convention had been sm'.h
ered under an avalanche of coun
I try votes, overcoming the tremen
I dous majority in favor of the meas
ure given by the ward bosses in
,New Orleans. Of all the offilcials
and state politicians, the ex-gov
ernor said, Ruffin G. Pleasant was
the only one to brave a fight against
the convention plan. He fought the
combined efforts of Robert Ewing,
Martin Berhman, Governor Luther
Hall, Lieutenant Governor Thomas
C. Barret and the Bull Moose chief
tan, going before the people of the
country parishes and making his
fight against the convention. He
was victorious in the country by
an "overwhelming 'majority. For
that reason, alone, said the speaker,
the ward bosses of New Orleans I
were forced to recognize Mr. Pleas
ant as their choice and that is the
reason why he was given a ma- i
jority in New Orleans.
He averted to the fact that Mr.
Pleasant 'could have been elected I
even though he had not received a
single solitary vote in the city of
New Orleans, as the country voters
had expressed their choice by an
almost unanimous vote.
He took a '"fling" at the Progres- c
sive candidate for governor, who, I
he said, was not well enough versed c
in the laws of Louisiana to hold
the position of chief executive; he
averted to the fact that Mr. Par
ker had claimed at the outset of f
the campaign that he would see to
it that t~e national government
would not pay the mileage of the
congressmen and Senator Rans- 0
dell, when as a matter of fact they a
are not allowed but the convening p
and adjourning of Congress. Mr.
Sanders also mentioned the fact
that Mr. Parker had a candidate
nominated by the Progressive :)n
vention for attorney general against fl
Judge Coco because the Dem::ocratic v
nominee had dared to speak tl
against him in French and Eng
lish. The speaker added that Mr.
Parker had chosen a man, whom
the law would not allow to make
the race, because of participation ti
in the Democratic primary.
Mr. Sanders charged that Mr h
Parker had grown angry because
Democracy had beckoned to its
servants at Washington to come to ce
Louisiana to defend its nominees; ii
he stated that Mr. Parker charged h
that they should have remained at
Washington though it was meet and
proper to bring Pujo and Brous- tl
sard to Louisiana, four years ago. c
for six months while Congress was "I
in session in order to defeat him
(Sanders).
The speaker in glowing language
closed with a splendid review of
the Democratic administrations in ti
the state for the last thirty years,
when Democracy came into its own. qi
He said that. Democracy had res- 91
cued Louisiana . from Republican ri
misrule and had made it one of the T

BULL MOOSE HEAD IS
HEARD BY HUNDREDS
JOHN M. PARKER AND EDWIN S. BROUSSARD ADDRESS ENTHUSI
ASTIC GATHERING AT COURTHOUSE
HERE LAST SATURDAY
t- At a rousing and enthusiastic
meeting which overflowed the court
room, John M. Parker, Progressive
;s candidate for governor and his run
ie ning 'mate, Edwin S. Broussard,
11 closed a strenuous tour of St. Lan
- dry and Evangeline parishes.
i Before the Opelousas meeting Mr.
Parker and his coterie of stump
v, pakers spoke to over one thou
sand people in Eva
- geline, and St. Landry parishes,
e the first meeting taking place at
d Grand Prairie, within earshot of
Congressman . Ladislas Lazaro's
home, where 250 people congre
- gated to hear the Bull Moose chief
e and his Independent Democratic
speakers. This meeting is said to
' shave been very successful, as well
I as enthusiastic, Mr. Parker being
r repeatedly applauded.
The speeches made at Grand
j Prairie were the same delivered at
Mamou, where some two hundred
persons assembled, at Ville Platte,
where over three hundred and fif
ty' heard the Parkerites and at
Washington, where two hundred
are reported to have listened at
tentively to the arguments present
ed in a forceful manner .
E. D. Estilette, speaking of the
moral obligation question, stated
in his speeches in both parishes,
"Your moral obligation is to the
state, and not to any man or set of
men. Your moral obligation is to
vote for the best man who you
think sincerely offers a program
that will benefit you."
,Mr. Estilette stated in his Ope
lousas address, in opening the Par
ker meeting, which was attended by.
some seven hundred people, that
John MA Parker was the one man of
all Louisianians that Governor Earl
Brewer, of Mississippi, had selected
to preside over the Dunbar-Walters
test case in New Orleans, and that"
it was only because the governor
realized that John M. Parker was
an honest, just and efficient man to
judge the identity of the Opelousas I
boy, that John M. Parker was I
chosen above all others.
John M. Parker was introduced by
Mr, Estilette; it was several min
uteS before the candidate could be- I
gin his address on account of the
enthusiastic applause given by the
local Parkerites.
Immediately upon being intro
duced Mr. Parker launched into the
discussion of his platform. He told
his hearers that if elected gover- r
nor of Louisiana he expected to
have enacted laws by which the r
business men and the farmers I
would be benefited. He said that
he elieved in the short ballot, that c
the governor should be given the 1
power to appoint minor state of
ficials, in brder to assure the peo
ple of this state an efficient adinin- P
istration" of affairs, by which means t
also the shortcomings of any ad
ministration could be traced to the r
proper officials. He gave the fed- s
eral government as an evax'p C, t
showing that when Bryan failed to f
entertain the same v:ews as Presi- '
dent Wilson he was forcedi to re. i
sign, and when Mr. Garrisons op- s
posed the president's preparedness c
project he too resigad as head of t
the war department. li
Mr. Parker stated that he did not o
believe in the primary, clairmiing v
that before a mai sl.hzld become p
a candidate for an offie he should p
have !ae recomme.dation of 25 per o
cent of the registere:l voters, then
he should offer his name at the C
general election. o
If elected governor he stated that h

Of 201,745 white voters in the
state 190,965 are registered as

sives and 2,076 Independents.
The figures are compiled from
reports on registration made by
the clerks of court of the country
parishes and the registrar of voters
of ,Orleans to Secretary Milllsaps.
Under the law the registrars of
voters throughout the state are
required to report the total regis
tration in their parishes thirty days
before the election. The figures
represent the registration on March

She would cause to be issued a call
rt for a constitutional convention to
re frame up the organic laws of Lou

d, composed of 25 members, nine of
- wvhom are to be appointed by the
governor, one from one from North
r. Louisiana, one from Central Louis
ip Tana and a third from South Lou
i- isiana, three bankers, two farmers
- and one labor unionist.
s, Speaking of the negro question
at Mr. Parker said: "If the negroes
)f are registered the work will be
's done by 59 Democratic registrars."
The speaker denounced Robert
f Ewing, publisher of the Daily
,c States and the Shreveport Times,
o whom he styled as the "Boss of
11 Bosses," then he politely took a
g fling at the country newspapers,
over 90 per cent of whom are sup
d porting Colonel Pleasant, stating
t that they were opposed to him,
d because of the constitutional'
amendments, which were published
- every two years.
,t He did not miss the Louisiana
clSheriff Association, of which Ma
Srion L. Swords of St. Landry, is
- president, saying that this organi
ation always stood firm in oppos
Sing tie abolition of the fee sys
j tem. He argued in favor of put
, ting every office in the state on a
salary basis.
f Mr. Parker stated that he was in
Sfavor of enacting a rural credits
law in this state, whereby the
farmers of Louisiana could secure
money at 3 or 4 per cent.
The speaker then launched into
'a vehemeit. attack on the Loiis
iana Congressmen and Senator Jos
eph E. Ransdell, who had journeyed
r from Washington to Louisiana in
order to fight c4rfr Democracy; he
incidently praised .Robert F. Brous
sard for denouncing Senator Rans
dell and Robert Ewing in, a speech
delivered in the United States Sen
I ate. Speaking of these Louisiana
officials who came from Washing
ton ix behalf of the party which
has honored them Mr. Parker said:
"I assure you that when I will be
governor these men will find me
on the stump in every parish of
Louisiana fighting them; I will do
all in my power to defeat them."
When he said this he was enthu
siastically applauded.
Mr. Parker was treated very cor
dially in Opelousas, where he
spent Friday night and Saturday
morning. A large number of Pleas
ant supporters who attended his 8
meeting on Saturday- morning con
gratulated him upon his address. t
The Parkerites were exceedingly V
well satisfied with the reception B
given their chief in Opelousas.
Immediately after concluding his c
addre'as Mr. Parker departed for v
New Orleans. where he ywas billed I
to make several speechrs a day. V
The crowd then left the court- a
room and went to the courthouse I
square, where they were addressed v
by Edwin S. Broussard, candidate
for lieutenant' governor. Mr. a
Broussard spoke along the same t;
lines as did Mr. Parker, laying more a
stress, however, on the financial I
conditions of Louisiana, saying that ti
this state owed over eleven mil- i
lions of dollars, that the state pris- n
on board was heavily in debt and y
that the schools in nearly all the o
parishes of Louisiana were com- a
pelled to close at the end of a five C
or six months term. Id
The brot'her of the "Roi de
Cajan" was well and enthusiasti
cally received by his many friends C
here.

PARISH IN DEMOCRATIC
CULIJMN SAYS LEWIS
Chairman of First Ward Demo
cratic Club Feels Confident of
'Pleasant Victory
CAREFUL CANVASS ASSURES
VICTORY IN ST. LANDRY
Reports from the Parish to Demo
cratic Headquarters Say Pleasant
Will Get Substantial Majority
John W. Lewis, chairman of the
First Ward Democratic Club, in an
interview Thursday morning,
claims that Ruffin G. Pleasant and
the other Democratic nominees
will carry St. Landry parish by a
substantial majority.
Mr. Lewis is very enthusiastic
over the outlook in St. Landry and
is firm in his belief that this par
ish will remain in the Democratic
column. He said:
After a careful canvass of every
precinct in this parish I have been
convinced that St. Landry will re
turn a majority in favor of Ruffin
G. Pleasant and his co-nominees.
"We started the fight a few weeks
ago with awful ends against us; but
Democracy has asserted itself and
we are now assured of a Democrat
ic victory, not only in the state, but
right here in old St. Landry.
"Despite the claims of the oppo.
sition that Parker will carry this
parish by five hundred to One thou-.
sand votes I must in all - sincerity
state that Pleasant will get a subk
stantial majority in this parish.
"Last Monday night's meeting in
Opelousas, as well as the Sanders'
tour of St. Landry has made many
young Democrats realize that, in
voting for Parker they are follow.
ing an avowed Progressive right
into the Republican camp of Theo
dore Roosevelt, .who is striving to
.obtain the Republican nomination
for President.
"We, who have been working day
and night in behalf of Democracy.,
feel certain that the majority. of
the votes in St. Landry will be
found in the Democratic coluxng.-
on next Tuesday, April 48."
The Democratic supporters have
been working strenuously, for the
past two " Weeks, with a determi
nation of cairrying-'the parish for
Pleasant. Democratic headquarters
report good news from every pre
cinct in the parish.
