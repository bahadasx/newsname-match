BOYS AND GIRS'S WORK

prise to many of 'the people who could
hardly believe that the young boys and
girls had done the work. Many favor
able comments were heard on every
hand and . proud parents visited the

again the good . work of their
iboys and girls. One purent said that
he had visited quite a number of sci on f
lj.it hud not seen any work superior to
'this shown in Lincoln County High

entirely satisfied with whut their cliild--

IN HIGH SCHOOL TOWN
"Mr. Bob" a comedy In two acts, was
presented by the students of the Un
'coin County HltU School on March 31
1916. Great credit In due Miss Mannle
Weed, manager; Mrs. Gertrude Smith
coach; and .to each member of the cast
for 'a delightful evening's entertainment
and to the great success of the play.
Applause after applause greeted the
' players and comments of hearty approv
al were showered upon all who had
aided In making theplay a success.
At four o'clock in the afternoon the
, "school band" serenaded the schools and
'. the town. This brought people out of
4 lelff houses Just In time to see the
' leader measure his length on the ground
The people Immediately decided to go
to the ploy; for. If it were as good as
.'. the"band" it would be worth the money.
So lt is needless to say that a large
. uudience met the players.
Miss Tannle Higglns took the part
. of 'Mr. Bob". She did so well that
she gained Lhe love of all, especially
: )at of Mr. Phillips. The part of Mr
') Brown, taken by Walter Long was un
;' doubtedly the center of applause and
laughter. Mfss Patty (Dolly Holltngs-
head) and Jenklns(James Wheeler) de
lighted the audience , from the beglntng
I to end. Miss Becky (Belle Hamblln)
v rendered the part ' so well that people
even Relieved she had "rats on the
i brain". Mr. Phillips (Guy Hamblln) up
on returning from . jtown after, finding
.1 ruts in his valise, led the audience .to
believe that 4he was really going to
' "paint the town red". Katherlne (Miss
RowenaLee) the demure little girl won

Situation in Russia.
London. The armies of the German
crown prince around Verdun are still
vigorously on the offensive against the
French.
The Germans are throwing their
best forces into the fight regardless of
the cost. By now they have brought
up something like thirty-three divis
ions (660,000 men).
Having delivered nn attack along
the line from Le Mort Homme to Cu
mlere8 which netted them a few small
portions of French trenches on the
east of Le Mort llemme, the German
commanders rested their Infantry
here, but In the region of Douaumont
Vaux, northeast of Verdun, threw their
men in large numbers against the
French trenches.
Here again they met with success,
but only for a short period of time, for
the French In a counter-attack drove
the invaders from advanced sections
of the trenches they had captured, and
In the operations took about 100 Ger
man prisoners.
Wlille the Douaumoni-Vaux attack
was in progress the Germans had not
overlooked the line between Le Mort
Homme and Cuinteres, and covered the
entlra region wtih an intense artillery
fire, probably preparing for another at
tack by infantry.
Along the remainder of the front in
France and Belgium there were only
artillery bombardments. In one of
heso north of the Alsne the French
guns caused serious losses to a strong
iennan column on the march.

In the Russian theatre an attempt by
the Germans to take the offensive In
the region of the Ikskull bridgehead
was stopped by the Russians. The big
guns of both sides have been busy at
various points elsewhere along the
front.
