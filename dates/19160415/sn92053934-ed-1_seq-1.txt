TO GERMANY
ON SUB ISSUE
Secretary Lansing Busy Pre-;
paring Answer to the
Teuton Note.
TO FORCE TO A FOCUS
Text Being Built to Clarify
Situation Germany
Is Perturbed.
Washington, April 15, The United
Stages government today was ready
Jur ;'.s next step in the crisis with Ger
many over submarine warfare. This
was the preparation of a communica
tion to he sent to Uerlin designed to
bring the situation to an issue.
The communication will go forward
within the next few days at the very
latest. The impression prevails here
that it will not be dispatched pending
a careful examination of all the evi
dence at hand regarding recent sub
marine cases including affidavits In
the case of the English channel steam
er Sussex, which arrived yesterday.
Secretary Lansing continued work
today on the statement of the Ameri
can case which will be forwarded to
Berlin. Mr. Lansing compared the af
fidavits on the attack on the Sussex
which arrived here last night with in
formation already before the depart
ment. Germany Perturbed.
London, April 15, (11:15 a. m.) The
correspondent at The Hague of the
Exchange Telegraph. -oonpfl,-fDr
wards the following:
"Considerable perturbation has been
caused at the Berlin foreign office by
r.ews received by wireless of American
dissatisfatcion with the recent German
note. The chancellor had several con
ferences with the American ambassa
dor and also discussed possibilities
with Count von Burian, Austro-Hun-g2rian
foreign minister, who is now in
Berlin. Lengthy instructions were
sent to Ambassador von Bernstorff at
Washington.
"German officialdom now seems fill
ing to strain every nerve in order to
avoid a rupture with the United States
while the press continues in a most
flamboyant way to give advice to Pres
ident Wilson, publishing vicious arti
cles and cartoons of the president."
Doubt Greek's Report.
Tarie, April 15, (4:45 a. m.) The
Greek naval officer, an alleged account
of whose experiences aboard the Sus
sex when she was damaged was pub
lished by a semi-official German news
agency, which attribute to the Greek
officer the statement that the Sussex
may have struck a floating mine and
also that the captain was killed in the
disaster, is Lieutenant Basil Zoiopou
los. Before leaving France he drew up
arid forwarded to the French navy de
partment a lung and circumstantial re
port. He was standing, he says, to
ward the stprn of the boat on the port
side immediately over the engine
room at the time of the explosion. As
the explosion occurred on the other
Ridf and forward he is unable to state
of hJs own knowledge whether the ves
sel was struck by a torpedo or by a
mine. He praises very highly the con
duct of the captain of the Sussex, who
remained on the bridge and directed
the rcscits operations and also that of
tiie captain of the Marie Therese, who
displayed great skill in taking off the
passengers and who even risked the
loss of his own ship in order to do so.
An American, John D. Harrison of
Chicago, was aboard the steamer Mar
gam Abbrl, sunk without warning
April S, American Consul General
Skitiiier today cabled the state depart
ment. Harrison was rescued. This
report was the first advice to the state
department that the sinking of the
Margam Abbri involved any American
titizeiiE.

in Men's Garb
New York, April 15. American
women soldiers will wear trousers as
part of their uniform if they follow the
example set by the 200 members of
the American women's league for self-
defense. These women have been at
tending weekly drills here throughout
the winter.
The style of uniform came tip for
vote last night and was the cause of
an animated discussion in which Mrs.
J. Hungerford Millbank, head of the
organization, asserted that the suits
worn by the women need not neces
sarily be uniform. She objected to
trousers on the ground that such a
uniform would be opposed by hus
bands. Others denounced dresses as a
"curse and burden" to women and ad
vised the women soldiers to get rid of
them. "When your husbands go to
the front," said one speaker, "you will
have to guard your home against ma
rauders. It will be a man's work and
you cannot do it in dresses."
The vote for trousers wa3 carried
by an overwhelming majority.
RAILROAD MEN ASK
ACTION ON DEMANDS
Chicago, April 15. Representatives
of the four brotherhoods of railroad
men have written to the Association
of Western Railways, asking the ap
pointment of a national committee to
deal with the union representatives in
the matter of their demands recently
submitted to the railroads of the coun
try, it was learned today.
Representatives of the railroads as
sert that compliance with the de
mands of the men that they be given
shorter hours and increased pay for
overtime would mean an annual in
crease of $100,000,000 in operating
costs. yThe railroads have until April
29 to take action on the demands.
They are willing to submit the matter
to arbitration, it was said.
THE WAR TODAY

the entire front in France and
Belgium. The Germans continue
vigorously to shell Le .Wort Hom
me, northwest of Verdun iind the
second line positions of the French
east of the Meuse but Hie French
are answering with their big guns
and apparently are holding them
selves in readiness for an infantry
attack.
On the eastern front, the Ger
maas, have been repulsed with
heaTy casualties by the Russians
between Lake STentin and Uzen.
In Galicia southeast of Bontclm
che, the Germans also were re

The Russians report successes
against the Turks around Frzer
um. It is said the Turks were re
pulsed with heavy losses and are
falllntr hack in disorder.
The British have driven back the
Turks along the Tigris river and
London regards this victory as a
step forward to the relief of the.
besieged force at Kut-EI-Amara.
At Washington, relations be
tween the I'nited States and Ger
many over the submarine contro
versy are said to be in a critical
condition.
The .Mexican government insists
that any armed expedition of the
I'nited States which enters Mexico
in the guise of a punitive expedi
tion must be limited to 1,000 cav
alrymen. Heavy artillery exchanges con
tinue along the front before Ver
dun hut the German Infantry has
not returned to the assault. The
chief point of attack of the tier
man guns last night was the area
between Malancourt wood and Hill
304.
Increased activity on the Galic
ian front is indicated by a state
ment from the Austrian war oflice.
Along the lower Stripa there were
several brisk engagements for pos
session of advanced positions.
In the Austro-Itallan campaign
repeated attacks were made on
each side. Austrian troops cap

SAYS ASPECT
OF MEXICO IS
NOTCHANGED
! Secretary of War Declares
Situation Stands the
Same Today.
ACT UPON PROPOSAL
Carranza Request Is Taken
Up at Washington
i Hunt Continues.
Washington, April 15 Declnr
ing that there is no change in
contemplation regarding; the Mexi
can punitive expedition, Secretary
Raker of the war department this
afternoon gave out the following
statement:
"The status of the expedition in
to Mexico Is as it. was at the he
ginning, in cordial cooperation
with the de facto government of
Mexico. That cooperation contin
ues and the expedition continues.
There has been no change either
in purpose or in the orders. 'o
change has been made in the or
ders and none is in contempla
tion.' Secretary Baker said General Funs
ton had not heard from General Persh
ing directly for three days but that
caused no uneasiness as General
Pershing has reported only when he
had definite and important informa
tion to communicate.. Reports from
other commanders in the field gave no
new status to the pursuit of Villa and
Vhjs bandits. ... . - ..
As time passes without official in
formation of the Parral fighting from
American source, officials are inclined
to doubt that the clash was as serious
as described in early Mexican advices.
Some army officers thought it prob
able that when a report was received it
would show the detachment had pass
ed in or around Parral since the dis-.
order and was proceeding about its
business of pursuing Villa, headed for
its original destination beyond the
town.
Sheds Light on Tangle.
Publication in Mexico City of the
terms the Carranza government seeks
to impose limiting any reciprocal
troop movements across the interna
tional boundary shed much light on the
diplomatic tangle which preceded Gen
eral Carranza's suggestion that the
Amrican troops be recalled from Mex
ico. Secretary Lansing declined to dis
cuss the matter. At the time the de
facto goverment suggested that no ex
peditionary force should exceed 1,000
cavalrymen and cross a deadline,
there were several thousand American
troops of all arms in Mexico and they
were 200 miles or more south of the
border.
Secretary Lansing has given no In
dication as to when a reply to tae
Carranza note proposing the with
drawal of the troops might be sent.
Several days may elapse before such
a communication can be completed.
The secretary is known to have many
details to consider.
Meanwhile a report from the com
mander of the American cavalry at
tacked by Mexican natives at Parral
is anxiously awaited. It is said to
throw light on the fate of the little
force and to clear up the conflict of
information regarding the attack.
The Carranza version is that his
troops did everything to stop the tir
ing upon the Americans. Unofficial
advices, however, assert that Carranza
soldiers participated in the attack.
Apparently the immediate withdraw
al of the American forces in Mexico
is Jiot contemplated. It is understood
that the success of the de facto gov
ernment in demonstrating its inten
tion and ability to hunt down Villa
and bis bandits, : l event the American
expedition is rec lied, would have
great weight with President Wilson
in reaching a decision :. yarding the
matter. '
President Wilson had before him to
day several long messages from Gen
eral Funston. They were presented
to him by Secretary of War Raker at
a midnight conference last night.
The secretary's visit at such a late
hour attracted considerable attention
here although he declared afterwards
that no significance could be attached
to it. The contents of the Funston
dispatches had not been disclosed
early today.
Month Vacation Cut In Two.
Madison, Wis., April 15. A two
weeks' vacation is all that will be giv
en to state employes thin year. Al
ways before the vacation was one
month In length, but the last legisla
ture reduced the period.
SENATORS CLASH
WHILE DEBATING
UPON ARMY BILL
Washington, April 15 To further
strengthen federalization of the na
tional guard the senate today by a vote
of S3 to 23 amended the army reor
ganization bill to require guardsmen
to take an oath to obey the orders of
the president as well as' the governor
ofr-their state. ' The amendment was
presented bySenator Wadsworth, who
said it originated n the national guard
itself.
"The chief purpose of the amend
ment is to place the national guard
soldiers primarily in the service of the
United States and secondarily in the
service of the state," Laid Senator
Wadsworth.
Senator Sutherland, republican,
urged adoption of his amendment in
creasing the coast artillery corps at
once to maximum strength.
"Our coast defenses have cost $41,
000,000 and are among the best in the
world," said he, "but we now have
enough men to man only one-fourth of
the guns."
Senator Borah, republican, attack
ing federal pay for the national guard,
aroused the senate today with a charge
that the $8,000,000 a year now ap
pointed by the government for the na
tional guard was "shamefully wasted"
and some of it "embezzled."
"That's a pretty serious charge,"
said Senator Pomerene, democrat, in
terrupting. "Well, I make it without any quali
fication," Senator Borah replied, and
he read from war department reports
to show that most of the funds had
been utilized by officers of the national
guard for themselves and that enlisted
men had practically no benefit of it.
Senators Pomerene and Reed
staunchly defended the national guard,
declaring that if there had been irreg
ularities there were remedies in law.

arid the military authorities are send

resentatives of mining companies with
