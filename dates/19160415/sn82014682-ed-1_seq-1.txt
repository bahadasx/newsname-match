: LONDON, England, April 15. That German high official arc
seriously concerned overi the evident determination of the United States
not to accept Germany V denial of responsibility in the sinking of the
British steamer Sussex is evident in a despatch from The Hague today
which throws light on the state of Teuton sentiment. "
The despatch says that the,(ermaii foreign office is perturlxrd on
account of the dissatisfaction in. the United, States over the status of.
the Sussex controtrsy and that inniiemial Gerinan 'officials are willing ."
to do everything in their power to avoid rupture -They are fealizing
that Germany's declaration that no German warcraft or mine was con
cerned in the sinking of the Sussex does not fit with the evidence upon
which the U. S. state department h takinsr its stand. .-;
