Mission Announced.

Rev. Francis Palette. Benedictine
Father. under the auspices of the
Knignts of Columbus; commencing
on Holy Wednesday April 19th.
The Knights of Columbus cor
dially invite all their friends tc

ceive Holy Communion on Easter

Uniform Dresses For Graduates
The School Board at its last
meeting adopted a resolution re
quiring that all graduates at the
High School wear a uniform that
will be given them as to their
dresses, in order that the poor chil
dren appear on this occasion as
well as those who have the means
to afford more expensive dresses.
We believe that this is a good
move, and it should be even car
ried a little further, as during the
week we notice some of the young
ladies are extravagantly dressed to
attend school while the less for
tunate ones who cannot afford ex
pensive dresses do not look as well
as the others and they feel the dif
ference. We believe in the uni
form and less extravagance in the
school children.
