A PLEASANT DEIOCRATIC DUTY: "STAP THE ROOSTER"
.EWS FROM DEMOCRATIC
UDE DQUARTERS.
Democracy is ready for the bat
tie of ballots which will be decid
ed throughout Louisiana on Tues
dai next.
In every parish the great hosts
of the Democratic party are1
awaiting the hour when they shall I
go to the polls and by stamping
the fighting emblen of their party
consign to ignominious defeat by
John Manyparties Parker and his
yapping band of political hybrids.
"FiWnl reports to Democratic
ii rters in .ew Orleans as
rare an overwhelming Demo
cratic vote in every congressional 4
district save the 'third, which is
dominated by Bull Moose officials
*ad populated largely by Re-- 1
publitan-Bull Monse voters.
But the Parkerites estimate of
e strength of their Republican
tPme raive candidate's strength
ian Third district are silly, say
the DLaorats. Within the past
sevral weeks converts by the
hundreds have been won through
o-t the Democratic party.
In New Orleans, numerous of
fe of -even-money bsts that the
Dsnoeratic majority in Caddo
prish alone will be as large as

Although the Parkerites in this
city have striven desperately and
vainly to develop strength locally
by the circulation of ridiculous
yards of "Parker strength in the
aouutry," very few of them are
wih.Ug to wager upon the outcome
of the election. This attitude o
their part is in direct contrast to
t~t aAmed four year ago by
the fowers of the various gu
bin-atorial candidates. Thous
andiof dollars were bet in New

According to Mr. Werlein's
estimate, Mr. Parker can enter
tain little hope of victory if he
I. spoke truth :when he made the
!id following statements at Ruston,
ies O':t. 23, 1915:
'I have been asked the ques
sts tion by several men since I arriv
Lre ed in Ruston, if a Man can vote

Is. mocratic primary election of
c January 25, 1916 and vote for

o- John M. Parker in the (eneral

is I dont want that kind of vote.
Is I think that if a man goes in

votes therein for State Officers

in Democratic nominees in the

In his speech Monday nig t

cratic State administ-ation. H

fruom a new angle, saying, in par
"The State government is di
ided into three departments: tl
EIxecutive, legislative and judi- g
cial.
"Mr. Parker is not attacking pl
the judiciary, of which his own el
brother is an honored judge in a
the city of New Orleans. He has s
Snot made an attack on a single y(
member of the legislature, and
he has not tried to put up more m
than 5 or 6 legislative candidates p;
out of 159 members. Therefore ce
he has let judgment go by default th
ag,,inst him and is not fighting tu
the Democratic nominees of the at
party for the legislature. He is w;
now fighting for the executive ti
offices of governor and lieutenant
governor, and any critici fn he na
has to make or any dissatisfac. an
tion he has to express must, -'
uecessarily be against the execu- yo
tive deoartment, since he does
not try to change the judges and "I
loes not try to d-feat the Demo- sui

F the transmission of knowledge t'

these I submit that the r)eno
cratic administration of the pres
f ent governor is something to be
proud of. That administration
has devoted and applied more
e money to the education of the
masses and the care and relief
s of sick. insane, suffering and
needy than any administra'&on
here since the Civil war. As to
our levees, they "re in better
-hape than they have e:. t: been
On September 29. l:.st, a -rib!e
storm of wind and water swept
away 40 miles of levee below the
city and by the most super-hu
man exertions the levee boards
and engineers appointed by Cov.
Hall broke all records for levee
building, and with the _ nited
jStates engineers restored those
levees in 60 days, saving the
people from the high water that
came in February. The Hall ad
ministration has put many good
laws on the statute books. It has I
built a magnificient system of
State warehouses for the housing
of the farmers' cropse. including
the cotton shipped to John M.
Parker & Co. It has aided in the t
building of roads and highways
and in the reclamation of lands
and when Mr. Parker speaks in
I such glowing terms of what he t
will do if elected governo;, I I
point with pride to what a Demo- I
cratic governor aided by a Demo- I
.ratic legislature has already t
done in the last for years.
