SEATTLE CASHIER IS ARRESTED
Prosecutor Will Ignore Liauor Order From Court
THIS ISN'T AN AD
For the Saturday Evening Poat. Just the
time, this week's issue of the famous
weekly has something you ought to read.
We reprint it on the editorial page today.
By the Editor of The Star
ON THE evening of the 16th of December, 1773,
a halt hundred patriots of Boston, disguised as
Indians, clambered aboard the tea-laden ship Dart
mouth. in Boston harbor, and staged the little
soiree which is known in history as "The Boston
tea party."
On the afternoon of the 14th of April, 10|6.
Mayor Hi Gill, Chief of Police Beckingham, Port
Warden Paysse and a squad of patrolmen and fire
men and "trusties" from the city jail, put on a
modernized version of the tea party sketch at the
Bell st. dock.
The Boston "Indians," armed with hatchets,
broke open scores of cases and poured $•><>,<hm>
worth of tea into the harbor.
At Mayor Gill's party, those present used
axes. Crates were smashed and t2,(XX) bottles of
beer were dumped into Elliott bay.
In Boston, it was "taxation without represen
tation!"
In Seattle, it was "representation without tax
ation!"
And, tho we hate to href, those Bostonians
must have been stepping some if their party was

any livelier than Msyor Gill's.
When the mayor, in a published statement in
The Star Thursday, said he was going to "get
rough" with professional offenders against the pro
hibition law, the town took the news with a grain
of salt. Hranklv, few seemed to be willing to se
riously accept Hi Gill in the role of a temperance
crusader.
But now Gill, apparently, has started his
"rough stuff." And The Stsr confesses, without
shame, that it is mightily tickled by the msyor's
auspicious beginning.
Whether the mayor had the right, under the
law, to destroy this contraband beer seems to be
in doubt. Some declare the law says liquor thus
seized shall be held until after the trial of the per
sons in whose possession it is found.
But the mayor tells me he sees no reason why
a little thing like law shall be permitted to stand in
the way of smashing up the drug-store saloon
business which, in Seattle, is making a joke out of
the prohibition law.
Gill's position, as set forth in an interview in
The Star Thursday, is that the police must con
vince these drug siore bloodsuckers that Seattle is

them of it is to stretch the law a bit and handle
them without gloves.
Gill has suggested that the police, when they're
satisfied they have nailed one of these professional
jackals, might wreck the place for him before they
quit. NOW GILL HIMSELF HAS STARTED
THE "ROUGH-HOUSE" TACTICS!
During the recent municipal campaign, The
Star intimated that Hi Gill, because of past asso
ciations from which it is so difficult for any per
son to divorce himself, would not be the man
to enforce the prohibition law. And everybody,
"wets" and "drys" alike, wanted the law enforced,
even tho possibly for different reasons.
Now I am beginning to change my mind.
I have talked the liquor situation over with
Mayor Gill. He professes to be a convert to pro
hibition "is personal observations since January
1 have dunged his view* entirely. He says he
will be a "dry" always.
It was this which, shortly before the

Well, looks like we're going to have a
good Sunday, anyhow. George Salisbury,
our genial wrather forecaster, gives us this
message today: "Fair tonight and Sunday;
heavy frost tonight."
in drug stores, pointed out the venal clutch of
this evil upon the community.
Mayor (jill's wrath is chiefly directed against
the pseudo drug stores which have sprung up, in
the last month or two, for the single purpose of
cheating the prohibition law by selling cheap, poison
ous whisky to creatures of the habit, at extortionate
prices.
The prohibition law provides a proper and
legal method by which persons who want liquor
can get it. The Star stands squarely with Mayor
Gill on this proposition.
There is no punishment too drastic for a pro
fessional law-breaker, who deliberately apportions
part of his ill-gotten gold against the expense of his
expected arrest and trial. Such a creature is the
real anarchist, a thousand fold more dangerous
than the bomb-thrower. He wr-cks the chances
for community peace and happiness. The liquor
question should be settled definitely—once and
for all.

Upon others, liquor was
