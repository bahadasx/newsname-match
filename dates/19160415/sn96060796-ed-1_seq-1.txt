by Bent Brothers, Contractors
building the subway, to finish
the work by' June 1, aocording
to E. D. Thompson, foreman in
charge. The south half of the
top slab is being poured and one
retaining wall remains to be
started. As soon as possible the
tracks over the north side; of the
slab are to be lowered intoplace,
probably before the end .of the
present month. The job is 70
per cent finished. The norther
ly approach has been completed,
except for the finishing plaster.
Work is now being pushed on
both the south approach and the
south half of the slab. Thompson

on in that section, and an army
of prospectors, investigators and
ore buyers coming and going
continually. Benson Signal.

now more than half of the group
of twenty three claims have
been proven as bearing tungsten
ore.

A rich gold strike is reported
to have been made six miles
north of Price on a claim located
by Thos. N. English. At a depth
of three feet a vein nearly three
feet wide has been uncovered
showing values as high as. $100
to the ton. This claim was locat
ed on April 1st and is named
the April Fool. A singular co
incidence on the location 6f his
claim is that the locator was also
born on A'uril 1st. -If this claim
developsj. with depth, Price is
due to Re""f)laeed on the map as
a gold camp.
Owing to the dark yolks of
local eggs, Wm. Griffiths, who
has been at Douglas seeking an
outlet for our "hen fruit" was
obliged to give up the effort be
cause Douglas people rejected
the eggs on the ground that the
dark yellow gave them the ap
pearance of being old. As a re
sult the matter was taken up
with the University of Arizona
Extension service, which has de
livered an opinion on the subject
and started a campaign of educa
tion on eggs containing dark
yolks, .which are caused by al
falfa. A light colored yolk is
no different than a dark-colored
one. Chandler Arizonan.
Tombstone, in keeping with
all other enterprising towns and
cities of the state has a Nation
al Rifle Club and its organization
was perfected today, when a
large number of prominent citi
zens and officials met at the
court-house, talked the matter
over, and perfected the organiza
tion. In Cochise county there
are no more than four or five
clubs, and as soon as the rifies
and targets can be procured
Tombstone will be among the
active list. Competitive shoots
are arranged between the various
clubs from time to time, and with
a number of average good shots
in the city, Tombstone will no
doubt make a favorable showing;
Stockmen in the vicinity of
Fairbank and Hereford are be
ginning to realize that the work
of the U. of A. Agricultural Ex
tension Service as now carried
on, is decidedly practicable. Re
cently Prof. G. W. Barnes, Live
stock Specialist of the Agricul
tural Extension Service, held
three field meetings with a total
attendance of 42 stockmen, at
which he vaccinated 927 head of
cattle for blackleg. The Boqui
llas Land Cattle Company
have been losing calves rapidly
for souie time and did not know
for: sure whether blackleg was
causing the damage; : in' fact, 18
head bad died in three days.
Prof. Barnes was called and not
only demonstrated how vaccina
tion for blackleg was done, but
as a result the number of deaths
has been greatly reduced. Many
of the stockmen present knew
little or nothing about blackleg
and the majority of them had no
idea of how stock was vaccinat
ed for this desease. i
- Under our law biennial re
gistrations are required. Section
2883 of the revised statutes of
Arizona, 1913, reads. "It shall
be the duty of every elector in
the State of Arizona, between
the first Monday in May and the
28th day of October, 1914, and
between the same dates biennal
ly thereafter, to register with
some notary public or justice of
the peace, or with the county
recorder of the county in which
the elector resides, in accordance
with this chapter."
The effort of the Villa raid on
Columbus is reflected in the
sharp decrease in the amount of
ore shipped through the port of
Agua Prieta from Sonora. The
value of the total mineral export
for the month falls below two
million pesos, Mexican gold.
The exports through Naco, com
posed almost entirely of copper
bullion and concentrates from
the Cananea Consolidated Copper
company's Cananea property,
shows an increase of about 200,
000 pesos, being almost two
million pesos, Mexican gold, in
value.
Texas advices are that the
usual April, May and June run
of grass beef from that quarter
will not materialize owing to
drouth and that the visible sup
ply of fed cattle from Texas will
be the smallest in many years.
Thousands of Texas grass cattle
that would have reached north
ern markets during the next 90
days, had feed been available,
must be removed to Oklahoma
grass and will not show up until
July, August and Sept. Grass
values have advanced sharply
in consequence while cattle have
declined. Texas conditions will
create an even more acute scar
city of beef and killers expect
hard picking during the next 90
days. Breeders' Gazette.
That the principles of the
single tax as advocated by
Henry George will be adopted in
a modified form by the constitu
tionalist government in Sonora,
is evident from a recent proclam
ation by General P. Elias Calles,
military governor, imposing
heavy taxes on holders of vacant
property. Lots of the first class
pay a tax of one peso per month
for each lineal front meter, lots
of the second class, seventy -five
centavos silver and lots of the
third class fifty cents silver.
The same decree also extends
the time for the payment of
taxes thirty days for those who
have not paid since 1910 in the
cities of Guaymas, Hermosillo,
Cananea, Nogales, Magdalena
and Alamos.

OUR DIPLOMATIC SOLDIERS.
It was thought, when our pun
itive expedition started into
Mexico, that the further it went
the greater would be the danger
of attack by a resentful people.
Now it appears that the actual
contact with our troops, instead
of insensing the Mexicans,
placates them. The more they
see of our soldier boys, the
better they like them; and ac
cordingly, the better they like
the country those boys repre
sent.. The uniform courtesy of
the army men, their scrupulous
regard for the rights and feel
ings of the natives, their modest
and businesslike behavioi, their
honest payment for everyting
they get, are changing suspicion
to smiling trust. .
Says General Pershing: "In
towns where a few days ago not
a soul was to be seen on the
streets when our troops passed,
men, women and children mingle
freely with the troops, and the
more intelligent of them are
preading the word that we have
not come to invade Mexico but
solely to capture Villa. In this
part of the country, at least, Villa
has failed to stir up the country
against us as he planned." .......
And barring accidents, it will
be so wherever the troops go.
The American soldier is his own
best credentials. Star.

WHAT "S. O. S." MEANS.
Tn tollmrr nitVl J- ! fr. 1 a
operator many snip passengers
ask the meaning of the three
letters used in the distress signal,
"S.O.S." There seems to be a
general opinion that the letters
are the abbreviation of three
separate words with a definite
meaning. Persons of an imagi
native trend will tell you that
the letters stand for "Save our
ship," "Send out succor, "Sink
or swim," or some such meaning.
The letters signify nothing but
that a ship is in distress and in
need of assistance. The call is
used by all nations as a universal
code, so that any wireless oper
ator, resgardless of the language
he speaks, can immediately in
tercept the call of distress. In
asmuch as the call is in use
by all countries, it can be seen
that the signal can have no
meaning in any language.
The character of the code makes
it a call that can be picked out
easily from other signals, being
composed of three dots, three
dashes, three dots, Ocean Wire
less News.
Export Tax Doubled on Sonora copper
Export duties on all copper
ores from Sonora into the Unit
ed States have been doubled,
according to the announcement
of the customs officials in Agua
Prieta.
In the future exported copper
from Sonora will pay a duty of
6i cents Mexican gold per kilo
gram (2.2 pounds,) against the
old rate of 3A cents. Expressed
in terms of United States cur
rency and weights, the increase
is equivalent to a raise from
eight-tenths cents per pound to
li cents.
On the monthly productions of
Cananea and Nacozari. approx
imately four and two and a half
million pounds, respectively, the
increased revenue will amount
to $52,000 a month, to say noth
ing of the smaller producers,
who will also be subject to the
increased rate.
The order for double duty is
thought to be the result of a re
cent visit of Luis Cabrera, min
ister of finance in the Carranza
cabinet, to Sonora, at which time
he advocated the idea that duties
on copper exports from Sonora
should be based on a sliding
scale governed by the selling
price of that metal. It is known
that for some time past General
Calles has been considering the
matter.
Oil From Asphalt-base Crude Wins in
England.
It would seem that Pacific
Coast motorists are not the only
ones who believe in oil made
from asphalt-base crude.
According to the National Pe
troleum News, such motor oil is
very popular in England. The
publication referred to prints
the following quotation from a
letter received from a British
marketing company, regarding
the use of oil from asphalt-base
crude, in the isle across the
pond:
"We have sold several thous
and tons during the last six
months and we understand from
buyers that these oils are giving
every satisfaction."
The arrest of Captain Gulley
at the instance of Adjutant Gen
eral Harris, on the questionable
charges preferred, is not a move
that will enhance the Adjutant
in the minds of the public. It
looks too much like the act of
a small mind obsessed with a
desire to "get even." The re
moval of Harris and the appoint
ment of a man of broad mind,
experienced in the handling of
men, and familiar with the duties
of bis office, would be the proper
solution of the problem which
now confronts the National
G,uard of Arizona. The head of
a military organization, who has
lost the respect of practically
the entire rank and file of its
membership, has outlived its
usefulness and should be con
signed to the. waste basket.
Arizona has the material and
should be able to boast one of
the best regiments of National
Guards in the entire country.
