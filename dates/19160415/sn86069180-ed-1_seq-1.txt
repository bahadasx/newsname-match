CATH0LICDIRECTORYSTAT1ST1CS
There are 1G, 564,109 Catholics in
Continental United States according
to advance sheets of the 1910 edi
tion of "The Official Catholic Di
rectory," published and copyrighted
by P. J. Kennedy & Sons, Barclay
street, New York. With fifty-two
dioceses reporting increases, six dio
ceses showing decreases, and with
forty-three archdioceses and dio
ceses making no change in the
population figure, the increase in
the number of Catholics during the
year 1915 is shown to bo 254,799.
This figure may not satisfy the criti
cal observer, but it must be- remem
bered that it is impossible for all
of the archdioceses and dioceses to
take a new census each year. To
the figure 16,564,109 could be add
ed, according to Joseph H. Meier,
the compiler, who has been study
ing Catholic population figures for
over ten years, at least 1,656,410,
representing the floating Catholic
population of the United States. No
records are kept of the floating
Catholic population and the 10 per
cent, would represent a very con
servative addition. Adding this 10
per cent, would increaso the Cath
olic figure to over eighteen millions.
Instead of deducting 15 per cent,
for children and infants, as is fre
quently done by statisticians, Mr.
Meier believes that 10 per cent,
should bo added to arrive at the
real Catholic population figure of
tho United- States. It must bo un
derstood of course that the figures
shown in "The Official Catholic Di
rectory" are exactly tho figures fur
nished by tho Chancery officials. No
additions are made for floating pop
ulation. For that reason the figure
in the 1916 edition is given as
16,564,109.
Including the Catholics of Iho
Island possessions of tho United
States it is found, according to the
1916 edition of "Tho Official Cath
olic Directory" that there are
24,922,062 Catholics under tho
United States flag. In the United
States proper there are 16,564,109:
in the Philippines there are
7,285,458. Tho additional 1.072,465
are in Alaska, tho Canal Zone, in
Guam, in American Samoa, in tho
Hawaiian Islands and in Porto Rico.
The 1916 directory shows theroforo
that there are almost twenty-five
millions of Catholics under tho pro
tection of tho Stars and Stripes.
Death laid a heavy hand on Ameri
can prelates and priests during tho
year 1915 and not in a scoro of
years have so many changes taken
place. Ono Archbishop and ten
Bishops passed away and according
to the necrology section of the pres
ent edition 321 priests went to their
eternal reward.
Catholics will bo Interested In tho
fact that tho publishers are trying
to secure figures showing the num
ber of converts received Into the
church during tho year. This Is a
most interesting item. The Chan
cery officials of sixty-nine archdio
ceses and dioceses have furnished
these figures for tho 1916 volume
and tho number of converts in these
sixty-nine dioceses is 19,009. It
must bo noted In this connection,
however, that many inffcmSnt"Utdh
dloceses and dioceses did not fur
nish figures for converts. No con
vert figures were reported by New
York, Chicago, Boston, St. Louis,
St. Paul, San Francisco, Brooklyn,
Buffalo, Hartford, Newark and
twenty-two other dioceses. Conse
quently the figure 19,009 would be
Increased by many thousands if all
of these important centers furnished
the necessary figures.
In this edition of the Catholic di
rectory It is shown that there aro
19,572 Catholic clergymen in the
United States. Of theso 14,318 are
secular clergy, while 5,254 are reg
ular clergy, that is members of re
ligious orders. The publication also
lists 10,058 Catholic churches with
resident priests; 5,105 mission
churches; olghty-flvo seminaries
with 6,201 students studying for
the priesthood; 112 homes for aged;
210 colleges for boys; 685 acad
emies for girls and 5,588 parochial
schools. In these parochial schools
there aro enrolled 1,497,949 chil
dren. "The Official Catholic Di
rectory" furthermore reports 283
orphan asylums with 48,089 or
phans. The publishers, P. J. Kenedy &
Sons, have prepared a most valuable
work crowded with interesting facts
and figures and a copy of this pub
lication ought to be in every Cath
olic home. Mr. Meier, the editor,
has prepared for the Catholic press
a list of the States having a Cath
olic population of over 100,000, Tho

PERFECTING PREPARATIONS.
The national convention of the
Catholic Knights of America is
always a big event, but Louisville
will be fully prepared and the dele
gates and visitors will be received
and entertained in the manner that
has won fame for Kentucky. While
all the details have not been worked
out it Is safe to say there will bo
"something doing" from the opening
to the close. Sunday afternoon
Chairman Reichort and the Eecutlvo
Committee held another enthusiastic
meeting at St. John's Hall, when
further progress was made in ar
ranging the programme. Nlc Bos

REFERS TO BRITISH METHODS
John Devoy, editor of the Gaelic
American, takes exception to pub
lished reports of his appearance un
der subpoena before tho Federal
grand jury on Friday. Characteriz
ing all the newspaper, accounts as
"TmToTfecttanorS5me as "malignant
Inventions," he wrote a letter setting
forth the reasons for his opinion and
sent copies of it to tho newspapers.
Commenting on the statement that
Federal authorities believed ho could
give valuable Information "as to
whether or not certain prominent
Irishmen here have been led by their
hatred of England to give aid to
German agents In this country," Mr.
Devoy wrote:
"The Federal authorities appar
ently believed that before 1 appeared
before the grand jury, but if they
believo it now it will be In spite oi
the evidence I gave."
Mr. Devoy says it' is not truo that
he was summoned to tell whether
any of tho money expended by Franz
Rlntelen, the German agent, reached
tho Irish weekly newspapers for pro
paganda work. "Tho statement Is a
lie," says his letter, "made out of
whole cloth for tho deliberate pur
pose of deceiving the public. I am
nqt at liberty to state what occurred
In the grand jury room, but If I
could do so it would effectually re
fute that falsehood. I can only say
that I am qulto satisfied with the re
sult and that I have every reason
to believo that Assistant District At
torney Wood and the grand jury aro
not dissatisfied. To me they pre
sented a striking and very pleasing
contrast to the English bodies in
Ireland which perform the same kind
of function. I feel at liberty to men
tion ono incident which occurred in
the grand jury room after my ex
amination was concluded. Mr. Wood
asked mo what was my opinion of
tho case. I replied as follows:
" 'My opinion is this: This man
Taylor, or von der Goltz, or what
ever his name is, was caught fts a
German spy in England and sen
tenced to be shot. He purchased his
ilfo by agreeing to betray his own
country. IT is lent by tho British
Government to tho American Govern
ment to help make out a case against
the Germans here. The papers say
he is accompanied by a Scotland
Yard detective and is still practically
a prisoner. He is testifying under
the direction and instruction of the
English detective, and of course ho
swears anything they want him to
swear. I know that class of men
from my experience In England,
where I was in prison for five years.
1 know British methods, and that
they would be glad to got mo In
volved in a case like this.'
"At this thero was a general laugh,
and somebody said: 'Then you don't
like tho English?'
"I replied that I had no objection
to the Individual Englishman, that
I had got along all right with every
Englishman I had ever worked with,
and that I only objected to tho Eng
lish Government in Ireland. The

Not one Irish paper and not one

DEMOCRATS
Would Insure Harmony by Elim

Controversj .
Tlio Latest AVatcrloo of Percy
Haly Forever Kills His State
Prestige.;
Louisville Herald to Ue Organ
of Local Itcpuhlican Or
ganization. ROSENBERG'S UNWISEORDINANCE
Kentucky Democrats aro pleased
with the harmony plans drafted this
week for the coming State conven
tion, and It is now an assured fact
that thegStanley-James faction will
dominate the convention. " There
is only one part of tho intended pro
gramme that will not be entirely ac
ceptable to all, and that Is if tho
men in control insist, as it is
rumored, on electing W. B. Halde
man as National Committeeman to
succeed Urey Woodson. Tho Halde-
man-Woodson controversy carried
through tho pi ess all winter was a
disturbing factor and created dis
sension throughout the rank and
file of tho party, and if either of
these two gentlemen can not see that
they owe it to the "Democratic party
to eliminate themselves from tho
foreground in the coming conven
tion then it should be the duty of
the delegates present for the good
of tho party to perform such act.
Neither of tho controversants has
a strangle hold, so to speak, on tho
affections of tho Domocratlo voters
and all can agree perfectly in
awarding the honors of National
Committeeman to any other man of
rank in the party. With tho elimin
ation of this controversy tho con
vention Is sure to bo harmonious
and steps can be taken to campaign
(n earnest to secure a big majority
for Wilson In Novomber. It was
suggested in theso columns several
weeks ago that In recognition of
tho services of the Fifth district or
ganizations in tho past two elections
Col. James P. Whallen or Col.
Frank McGrath should be chosen as
one of tho delegates to the national
convention, and on Thursday tho
Times predicts that thero is a
movement on foot to select Col.
Whallen.
Several years ago the Kentucky
Irish Amorlcan ridiculed the idea
of Democrats bowing in suppllanco
to the wishes of Percy Haly, It be
ing stated then that ho was a very
much over-rated politician and that
his success was duo to the fact that
ho was given free reign in dis
tributing pio under both tho Beck
ham and McCreary administrations.
In discussing Haly's plans last year
the Cincinnati Enquirer correspond
ent roferred to him sarcastically as
a "kingmaker" in politics, but the
sarcasm was wasted on some, who
accepted it literally and followed
Haly and Beckham blindly when
they splected McChesney as their
candidate for Governor. It is un
necessary to add how tho Haly
Beckham candldato was burled in
the primary by Democratic votes,
in tho recent sessions of tho Gen
eral Assembly Haly again "was
beaten at every turn, although hav
ing the prohibition vote as an as
set to start with on every measure.
His latest defeat and one which Is
acknowledged at this stage Is in
the fight for control of the State
convention. A few weeks ago it
was announced with a great blare
f trumpets that tho redoubtable
Percy would support Vansant for
Chairman, but tho campaign for
control had only been on a week
when the Haly-Beckham cohorts
were driven to the trenches and
Vansant announced his withdrawal
from the race. This last is ex
pected to be Haly's Waterloo and
many predict that he will not even
attend the coming convenlton.
The latest turn In Mexican affairs
only serves as a reminder of the
nredtction
in these columns or
Saturday, January 1, and which was
ftB follows:
"Then, attain, the Wilson policy
n Mexico has been n unpopular
one, tho recognition of Cnrrnnzn. be
ing a grievous mistake, nnd that
this is truo is seen in tho attitude
of Roosevelt, nho, always ready to
take tho popular side of an issue,
ius nliendy advertised his disap
proval of the administration's Mexi
can policy. But summing it nil up,
nnd unless thero is n miraculous
change in tho opinions of tho lend
ers, Wilson -will again bo tho nom
inee of tho Democrats, nnd in all
probability Roosevelt will carry tho
Ucpublicnn standard."
was a mistake and that Teddy would
be the G. O. P. nominee Is a pretty
good prediction for New Year's day.
The Louisville Herald has already
dropped its Progressive mask and
will be found supporting tho Rough
Rider and the local Chilton-Searcy
combination, although the latter
confessed that they had handplcked
tho forty-four men as members, of
the local Republican Committee
with power to select the nominees
In local and other elections. De
spite this you will find the Herald
referring to bosslsm In tho Demo
cratic party.
Speaking of local politics, tho
General Council, for the good of all
concerned, should smother tho or
dinance introduced by Councilman
Rosenberg, In which he Is endeavor
ing to give school janitors the pow
ers of police. That this would bo
abused there Is no doubt, as tho
school janitors today form a pretty
good political organization In them
selves, and with the powers of po
lice they would make trouble in lo
cal elections.

Francis Sullivan, suggested this
idea recently to the parish commit

next six years $125 will he sent
regularly to Maryknoll for the edu
cation of a priest. A like amount,
pledged by an unnamed friend and
extending over the same period, will
complete the sum ($250) required

EXAMINATIONS HELD LAST YEAR
"To provide for the social and
religious welfare of the sailors of all
nations who touch at the Atlantic
end of the Panama Canal Zone tho
United States Government, it has
been learned, throuch ' Major Gen.
George W. Goethals, has set aside a
plot or land near the docks of
Christobal Colon, for tho use of tho
American Seamen's Friend Society,
Wall street, New York." Thus ran
the announcement of April 1. "Hun
dreds of seamen," Gen. Goethals was
quoted as having said, "will be 'In the
port of Christobal Colon, at tho At
lantic end of the canal, In normal
times. Theso will be not only sea
men of ships passing through tho
canal, but also of ships bound for
South America which touch at this
point In tho Canal Zone. There is
no special provision for the social
and religious needs of the men, aud
the offer of the American Seamen's
Friend Society, an Interdenomina
tional Christian organization, to sup
ply this want meets with our hearty
approval."
Tho effort will bo not so much to
house tho seamen as is the aim of
the society In tho maintenance of
Its Well known homo In New York,
but rather to provide a social and
religious atmosphere of the best sort
for the sailors who stop at theso
ports. The society has for fully
one hundred years carried on Its
work among seamen and Its activi
ties now extend to many parts of tho
world. Wiile "Interdenominational,"
it is frankly Protestant in atmos
phere and In its religious endeavors.
Certainly any ono truly interested in
the seamen must hear with pleasure
of this effort in their behalf. Regret
can not but ho exnrpssed. however-.
tTiat' thero la no Catholic organiza
tion taking up this work In this samo
way for tho sailors In particular of
our faith. Many of them will like
wise stop at the canal ports and cer
tainly theyv should bo cared for and
their faith protected. Tho care of
these men of the sea was ono of tho
works dearest to tho heart of tho
sainted Pius X. It would be an ex
ceedingly happy thing to hear of tho
establishment of a Catholic Seamen's
Home in Panama and at other Inter
national stopping points.

exact figures aro 21,078, the largest
number in the history of tho New
York Civil Servlco Commission.
During tho five-year period, 1906
1910, 61,543 were examined, whilo
In 1911-15 tho total came to 94,856,
or an Increaso of 64 per cent. The
number of examinations for scien
tific and technical positions, it is
understood, steadily increased. Some
of those which might be mentioned
wero that of court stenographer,
with a salary of $3,600 per year;
Director, Division of Communicable
Diseases, Department of Health,
?4,000; assistant engineer of tho
Conservation Commission, ?3,000;
and Deputy Industrial Commissioner,
with a salary of ?4,000.
Tho civil service opens a splendid
opportunity for Catholic men and
women. This opportunity they should
hasten to seize. If this is done, it
more and more of our people enter
these competitive examinations, it
will mean that more and more of
our number will seek to educate
themselves In various occupations,
fn this way will wo bring about a
great increaso of Catholics In the
more educated classes. Our mem
bership will not be composed of
shcIi a pronounced ratio of tho mem
bers of ono stratum of society as at
the present time. It would be most
Interesting to learn tho porcentago
of Catholics In the great number of
those who took the New York ex
aminations last year. Perhaps It was
very representative and well in pro
portion to their ratio In tho com
munity. But tho number can still
further be Increased and should be.
Catholic young people In particular
should take note of these things
and profit by them.

LONG BELOW ZERO.
Mrs. Watt Tucker, formerly of
Shelbyvllle. but now residing at
Endlangr, Alberta, Canada, writing
to Kentucky friends, says of the
weather conditions there:
'wa nave nau a long, cold win
ter. From Christmas day to
Fehruary 2 the thermometer was
Ranging from 20 to 50 degrees be
low zero, but almost evoryone was
prepared for tho winter. We had
deep snows, and great drifts piling,
up until sometimes wo thought we
might becovered up some morning
in our homes, but there came, about
the middle of February a warm
'chlnook' that melted tho. snow very
fast. Thero has been no rain since
last September, so ypu see our win
ters are very dry and cold. The
wild geese, are baek again from
their winter quarters and this
makes us feel that winter is over."
