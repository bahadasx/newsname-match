As was < ' \ I • o t < m I tile Progrès
si vc meeting m I i it I i took pliiee in
the Elk Theatre building last
Tuesday night was one of the lug
gest outpourings that ever as
seiiililed at one time in New Iberia
to attend a political rally. Aside
from Ihe fact that Progressive
adherents from every Ward in
Iberia rallied to the call of the
leaders 1o he present, several htm
died strangers and visitors from
every little hamlet between M or
gan City and Crowley eatne to
New Iberia to help swell the
inimlier. The fact that Mr. .lohn
M. Parker who heads the ticket
for Governor failed to put in ap
pearanee was a great disappoint
ment to many who were anxious j
to hear him speak. The Theatre
building was rea ly tilled to o\m
flowing as long as one hour he
fore the speakers arrived and it
was very necessary to hold (in
outdoor meeting while the big
mectin t r was coing on inside tin
Opera House.
lion, -lohn D. W'alet of I oreau
ville presided over the ting,
the speakers being besides Mr.
Broussard, Judge W. E. Howell,
a life-long Republican; -Ji dge E.
D. Estilette, who also owes his al
lcgiance to the same party and
ex-Judge Minos T. (lordv of Ver
milion who characterized the New
'Orleans ring as a menace in the
Istate. and cn'led attention to the
'financial condition of the state,
a ltd deplored the fact that hi ih
salaries paid i s'less officials ne
eessitated the cutting down of
appropriations.
The judge then warmed up and
commenced using the short and
ugly word rather indiscriminate*
|lv. He said. "When a man makes
ja statemnt of an alleged fact from
! ;r fnlse premise, he may be ex
jcusciL but when he Meliberatel>

fact that-he is falsifviug if with i
that knowledge he tells the people
■I rntruth. be is nothing mote
-n an ordinary liar. The people
who are going about telling you
that if John M. Parker is elected it
means the encouragement of thq
negro to return to politics in our
state, nre nothing more than ordi
nary liars."
Uosen Rape New Orleans.
Charles Rosen of New Orleans
was the next speaker. Mr. Rosen
proceeded to amplify the fact that
lie came from a ring ridden, op
pressed city, and that no man or J
woman could live in New Orleans,
even for a short while withoûtl
,-alizinï IM» foot, llo pMMM
Ä . ' ...
lolitical slavery
be.v did not rise in their might.
He said that ihose who rebelled
igainst boss rule paid the penalty
throegh ring asessors. ITe de
dared that the attempt to bring
be negro issue into the cam
paign was n joke.
"We do not fear the negroes."
shouted the speaker, "what we do
p oar is the Indian. In New York
Miese Indians call themselves
Tammanyites, in Chicago they are
Iroquois, but in New Orleans they
are Choc-taws. The negroes are
not bothering about politics, but
these Indians scheme by day and
night. When they can swing an
election straight, they may do it,
nt when there is no other way,
they swing it crooked."

MAKING DIAMONDS.
A recent, dispatch front Switz
erland informs us that that conn
try with its industry and coin
meiM'e varalyzed by the war has
found a source of compensation,
The Swiss are making diamonds,
we were told real diamonds, by
an artificial process. "The syn
! bet ie diamond has at last been
discovered."
There may not be anything'
really new in this. A process h.r
ma kin" diamonds was discovered
. . . ,
by scientists many years ago, and
is iiow common property. It in
volves heating pure carbon to
, ....... I
v«I»«»ri/iirg te rature under it.t
niense présure, and then letting it
cool. As tin* carbon vapor con
denses, it crystallizes, forming did
I mouds. But the discovery has
been of no commercial use, lie
cause hcrtofore all the diamonds
produced have been micronopic in
size.
j If Swiss experimenters have
really found a way to make dia
monds of commercial dimensions,
the discovery is of great import
"tce.. It will mean vast wealth
for those who control the secret.
And inej'itaJily jt will mçan the
other diamond in the world.
It was reported a few years ago

that a French scientist had per

has destroyed his equivalent and
taken Iiis secret to the grave with

a huge sum had ben paid him by
