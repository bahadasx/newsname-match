"The Family Cupboard."
"The Family Cupboard," a power
ful five-palt photoplay adapted from
the successful stage drama of the
same name, will be the offering at
the Gem Theatre today. While the
story cannot be fairly described as
altogether a pleasant one, it is full of
dramatic power and moral _signifi
cance, as the following brief f;utline
will show:
Charles Nelson is a self-made man
and has amassed a fortune. His fam
ily consists of his wife, son, Kenneth,
and daughter, Alice. His wife has
become absorbed in society, requir
ing all the money her husbaud can
make to support the large establish
ment she maintains. The wife, son
and daughter are out night after
night, leaving Mr. Nelson much
alone; while he pays the bills, he has
little of the society of his family.
He turns to Kitty Claire, a vaudeville
performer, for consolation and com
panionship.
His son Kenneth gets into an ar
gument with a friend at his club and
hears that his father is keeping a
woman in an establishment up town.
Kenneth returns home, under the in
fluence of liquor, and insults his
mother's companion, Mary Burke.
Mr. Nelson enters, sees the situation,
and asks what it all means. Kenneth
turns on him and tells him every<one
knows he is keeping a woman in an
apartment up town. This conversa
tion is overheard by Mrs. Nelson,
who asks Mr. Nelson if the charge is
true. He replies, "Yes." They agree
to part. Kenneth clings to his moth
er, Alice, the daughter, sympathizes
with her father. She realizes it is
their own fault; they have given him
nothing in return for all his labor in
their behalf,
Mr. Nelson is now living at the Al
pine apartments, to which comes Kitty
Claire. He tells her the end has come.
Meanwhile Kenneth, the son, has
come to see his father. Kitty, going
out, hears him ask if his father is in,
and seeks an acquaintance with Ken
neth, who becomes infatuated with
her and moves to the same hotel.
Then Kenneth. begins to live a Bo
hemian life with Kitty Claire and
Dick LeRoy, another vaudeville per
former.
He finally asks Kitty to become his
wife. She replies that it is impossi
ble, there is another man-, The
boy, crushed and broken-hearted, de
mands the name of the man. Mr.
Nelson enters at this point and Kitty
points to him.
Humilisted and ashamed, Kenneth
decides to end his life. He is about
to write a letter when his mother ar
rives. She sees the pistol and tries
to keep him from carrying out his
plan. They are interrupted by a
knock at the (0oor; Kenneth is called
down to the office by the clerk; and
while he is gone Mrs. Nelson seizes
the opportunity to telephone to Mr.
Nelson. He arrives, with Alice, the
sister. Kenneth and his father are
reconciled, also Mrs. Nelson and her
husband, and the family are reunited,
Holbrook Blinn plays the part of
the errant husband; and the exquisite
young Frances Nelson is the vaude
ville star who enslaves both father
and son.

Valli Valli in "The Turmoil."
Valli Valli, the gifted English act
ress; supported by the accomplished
juvenile star, George LeGuere, and a
cast of unusual strength, will be seen
at the Grand Theatre tomorrow in
"The Turmoil," picturized in 5 parts
from the masterpiece of American fic
tion of the same name by Booth Tar
kington, America's foremost novelist.
A brief synopsis of the gripping story
is as follows:
James Sheridan becomes wealthy
and a power in a middle west city,
where his entire life is absorbed in
the turmoil of his own creation. The
only thing he lacks is social standing,
and this he strives to gain by meth
ods he has successfully employed in
driving a business deal. His two
oldest sons, Jim and Roscoe, are, like
him, products of the turmoil, but
Bibbs, the youngest, is a weakling
with a penchant for books. The
father insists on Bibbs working in the
factory, but as it is distasteful to
him, and he is physically unfit for the
task, his health fails and he is sent
to a sanitarium.
In the same city lives the Ver
trees family, poor, but true aristo
crats.- There is a young daughter,
Mary Vertrees, and Sheridan deter
mines that his son Jim shall marry
her, and thus make the wedge for
the family into social prominence. He
arranges a big dinner, with a vulgar
display of luxury, ,which Mary Ver
trees is obliged to attend because of
a financial obligation Sheridan holds
over her father. That night Mary
is made to understand that she is to
marry Jim, and she concludes to make
the sacrifice.
At the height of the dinner party
Bibbs returns from the sanitarium.
He is ignored by the family, and Mary
is attracted to him out of pity. Ros
coe Sheridan, the second son, is mar
ried to Sibyl, but their married life
is far from happy., Like his father, he
is lost in the turmoil of endeavor and
Sibyl is obliged to seek companion
ship elsewhere, She becomes infatu
ated with `Robert Lamhor-, a worth
less young man, who is secretly en
gaged to Edith Sheridan, the only
daughter of the house of Sheridan.
Jim proposes to Mary Vertrees,
and she asks him to wait a while for
her answer. Sibyl and Edith quarrel
over Lamhorn, and Sibyl, knowing
Mary's hold over the elder Sheridan,
asks her to go to Sheridan. and tell
him Edith and Robert are engaged,
and that Robert is only marrying the
- ~~ e ;. Sibyl's words
`remt i a: ytht-, seÂ° will 'lie' cuing
the same thing, if she marries Jim.
She writes Jim a letter refusing his
offer of marriage. Much to the de
light of his father, Jim has built a
large warehouse in half the time con
tractors said it could be done. Ac
companied by the inspectors, Jim is
on the roof of the house when it col- I
lapses, and he is killed, I
Sheridan is broken-hearted over
Jim's death. His sorrow is doubled
because of the fact that Roscoe, wor
ried over domestic affairs, has taken
to drink. He then strives harder
than ever to make Bibbs a thorough
business man, and his successor.
Edith elopes with Robert, and Bibbs
is the only one left to him. Bibbs
has become attached to Mary, and on
her advice agrees to a business career.
She loves him, but thinks his atten
tions are prompted through pity for
her. She refuses his proffer of mar
riage for the same reason she refused
his brother. When Bibbs, learns of
this, he quits his place with his
father and informs him he does not
want any of his fortune. Sheridan
awakens to the situation, and pays
Mr. Vertrees $50,000 for some worth
less street railway stock. Mary's
family thus becomes financially com
fortable, and she accepts Bibbs' re
newed proposal of marriage, and he
becomes the leading spirit of Sheri

PRINTING MATERIALS COSTLY.
Since War Began Advance in Price
Has Been Steady.
Ever since the beginning of the
European war nineteen months ago,
and particularly during the last six
months, the prices of all sorts of
necessities around a newspaper plant
have mounted higher and higher un
til the total of increased costs has be
come enormous, says the Editor and
Publisher. Products essential to the
making of newspapers have jumped in
price all the way from 10 to 3000 per
cent.
Before the war type-metal cost 8
1-4 cents a pound, This week it costs
13 cents. This increase in cost alone
amounts to thousands of dollars a
year for the large daily paper.
Press rollers, which are made large
ly of glue, glycerine and molasses,
have gone up, so manufacturers no
tified the consumers last week, 40 to'
70 per cent. Glycerine has taken one
flying leap from an ante-bellum price
of 19 cents a pound to 54 cents.
Prices on all grades of paper are
going up. No pulp is coming to the
manufactarers. Mills that not so
!iong ago were selling by the ton are
now filling orders for pounds. Rags
bought up eagerly by the powder
manufacturers,. needed also by paper
manufacturers in a cleaned and more
or less sterilized form, are a necessity
in the mechanical departments of
newspapers. The price of rags has
jumped just 100 per cent.
But it is when the consumer of any
thing having to do with dyes or any 1
other department of the chemical see
tion of printing and photographic
reproduction goes out with his shop
ping list that his hair turns gray.
Metal, which the art department of a
paper cannot get along without, cost 1
$4 a pound before the war. Now it
costs $50 a pound. Increases of 1000
to 3000 per cent and more loom up
all over the chemical section of the
printing shop.
Acids, dyes, and other ingredients
of colored printing inks jumped from
300 to 3000 per cent, once the im
ports from Germany had been block
ed. Blues that cost 58 cents before
the war now cost .$14 and $15 a
aou d, with increases in yellows also
ill the way up to 3000 per cent. And t
the manufacturers of inks say that
prospects of filling demands in the
future look doubtful.
A company ot United States Ma
tines, skilled in high altitude gunnery,
has been attached to the advance base
brigade of the United States Marine
Corps, and will be known as the anti
aircraft gun company. This is the
first aero-defence company organized 1
in the Marine Corps, if not the first
in the United States.

VOTES FOR WOMEN.
Southern States Woman Suffrage
Conference.
417 Camp Street, New Orleans.
Woman Ship News Manager.
As an assistant in the maritime
branch of the Board of Trade of New
Orleans, Miss Nettie Palliser has
practically conducted the business.
Now she has been officially appointed
to the position of manager and is the
first woman to direct any department
of the New Orleans Board of Trade.
She will furnish all information re
garding steamships. Her department
has direct wires with Port Eads,
Quarantine and Sand Key, and is in
touch with all vessels. Notwithstand
ing this important and responsible
position, Miss Palliser and all other
women in Louisiana are not deemed
worthy of the vote, although the bal
tot requires no high degree of trust
or responsibility for men. In fact,
ignorant men voters are specifically
recognized on election day, while wo
men of culture, refinement, education
and capability are classed with crimi
nals, paupers, insane or idiots, What
IS the matter with Louisiana?
Iowa School Directors,
Women serve on school boards in
Iowa. Mrs. James R. Hanna, wife
of the mayor at Des Moines, was re
cently elected to the school board of
that city. Her platform of princi
ples included these planks: "I ap
prove of serial school bonds; economy
in business management; open-Vir
schools; vocational education; and ad
aptation of the high school needs to
the mass of children." That- was a
splendid and practical declaration,
and it is no wonder that Mrs. Hanna
was elected by a handsome majority.
Mississippi Valley Will Confer.
Every state drained by the Missis
sippi river will have representative
women at the Mississippi Valley Suf

and those from the state of Iowa hope
to obtain the ballot in June. But
voting and voteless women will com

FOR A GREATER SOUTH.
Chance Mr Farmers, Bankers and
Business Men to Work Together.
The Southern. Agricultural Asso
ciation and the Southern Industrial
Council, both meeting in New Or
leans April 16-20, will bring together
the leaders who are working for a
new agriculture -.and a new in
dustry in the, south. 1-low to
finiance agriculture so that it can be
come a prosperous industry is the
pressing question of the hour. A
distinguished member of the Cana
dian Parliament, himself a great
banker, M. Alphonse Desjardins, has
developed a successful system of ru
ral credits and has accepted the ear
nest invitation of the above organiza
tions to come to New Orleans and tell
how the Canadian plans are being
worked out.
Among the Sopthern states, North
Carolina is possibly evolving the most
successful planofor financing the
farm. Leading in this movement are
John Sprunt .Hill, a banker of Dur
ham, and W. R, Camp of the A. & M.
College. They are organizing unions
and working upon a thoroughly prac
tical basis. Both Mr. Hill and Pro
fessor Camp will be in New Orleans
along with a large delegation from
the Old North State, bringing with
them invaluable experiences not only
in the matter of tinance, but in all
the questions of agricultural and in
dustrial developr ent.
Another purpse of the session is
to take stock of the conditions that
have been created by the world-war
and the boll-weevil, and put ideas and
experiences together to get at the
southern agricultural policy for the
future.
It is further recognized that so
long as we send our raw materials to
far away regions to be turned into
things of value, Lust so long will the
south remain in poverty. The In
dustrial Council therefore is organ
izing a southern-wide movement for
the co-operation of all citizens in the
development of our manufacturing
industries. The fit step is to get our
own people to use southern-made
goods. We create wealth in stagger
ing millions every year, but we send
it away fop things that could be
grown and made at home.
But before we develop our manu
factures we must have skilled hands,
trained minds, _ ply . developed per
sonalities, and -w" can get all this
only through co-operation of school
and industry. how to bring this
about is a question that will be an
swered by a numnber of 'distinguished
leaders in the educational and in
dustrial fields.
There is still another necessary
step. Man doese-,ot live by bread
alone; he must d satisfaction and
opportunity in tomixmunity. The
lif.and activite :,ich he cgs hia
mind and soul. for is reason a
committee wir' memhers from all
parts of the Un ited States has been
organized to bring together thoughts
and experiences' to be welded into u
practical reereatidn program that
can be adapted to the needs of any
community. The committee will sub
mit its report to a community session
of the Conference presided over by
John Lee Coulter, 'dean of the college
of agriculture, University of West
Virginia, at which also workers from
the entire country will give their ex
periences in commupity building.
The "Home as Source of Com
munity Power"will be a central theme
in the Conference of Southern Wo
men. which meets. on the same days.
The Conference is undertaking to
bring about the co-operation of the
forces of organized' womanhood for
the development of industries pecu
liarly suited for girls and women in
the southern states.
Without spiritua4 power the cam- I
munity can do nothing. Therefore, c
the session opens with a Conference v
of Church and Sunday School work- f
ers, presided over by John -M. Mo're r
secretary of the department of home a
missions, M. E. Church, South, Nash- t
ville, Tennessee. Taking part in this
conference is a group of remarkable s
men-men who are moving nations f
to a higher life. v
The Conferences of School Work- t
ers meeting at the same time will t
bring together the state superintend- c
ents of public instruction; college and v
university presidents; town, city and t
county superintendents; priticiples of *t
schools, and teachers ranging from I
the elementary grades on to the uni
versity. The -men and women who
are making the education of the south
will be in New Orleans. ( 1
All groups unite in the general ses
sions that foram gatherings the like.
of which cannot be found elsewhere
in this country. The sessions conie
to a climax with the address of Wil- I
Liam JenningsBryan of Nebraska on
Thursday evening, April 20. It is i
expected that the message of the
great commoner will be one of the
most, important in all 1its career, one i
that will attract the attention of all
the Americas.

TESTING NEW HOG SERUM.
Success of Experiment will Revolu.
tionize Swine Industry.
Drs. Charles W. Duval and Maurice
Couret. Tulane University professors
and Charity Hospital pathologists,
left New Orleans recently for Ames,
Iowa, where they will conduct a final
test of their serum for the immuniza
tion of swine from the dreaded
cholera. If they succeed in their mis
sion the farmers of the nation will re
qaive a great boon and the swine in
dustry will be placed upon a more
solid foundation. As Louisiana can
raise swine cheaper and better than
any other state, she will profit chiefly
through the skill and effort of her
scientists.
Dr. Couret is the pioneer in the
quest, and it was the need of the state
which inspired his research. The boll
weevil had attacked cotton, and then
came war and reduced prices, sugar
raced the tariff threat, diversification
was being preached and its practice
had begun, and many undertook the
rearing of hogs. The industry prom
ised well, but there was the menace of
hog cholera. The Louisiana plant
was turning out serum and selling it
at cost, but even at a lower price than
in other states it meant more than
30 cents to vaccinate each hog, and
the dose was protection only for a
limited time. The simultaneous treat
ment, which assured longer immunity,
required both serum and virus, and
was therefore costlier, and,' besides,
required experts to administer it.
The bacteriologists in the medical
ranks devote themselves mostly to the
problems of human ills, and few of
The veterinary investigators are bac
teriological experts. Dr. Couret had
both mind and heart for the work,
and patient experiment at last found
its reward. He discovered a way of
treating and converting the virus into
a powder, a single dose of which im
munized a hog - permanently. A
capsule inserted behind the ear dis
solves into the system, gives the an
imal a mild attack of the cholera, and
in about thirty days the hog is cholera
proof. All that is required is rea
sonable isolation during that month,
so that the animal does not contract
a genuine case of the cholera to null
ify the dose and aggravate the disease.
The dose of the Couret powder can
be manufactured for fifteen cents,
and wholesale supply will cost consid
erably less than half the present
temporary preventive. It is , a
magnificent gift to the farmers.
Dr. Duval joined in the search and
assisted in its culmination. Both sci
entists are still at work upon the iden
tification and isolation of the ultra
microscopic germ, so infinitesimal that
it defies detection. The separation of
the germ may lead to still more effect
ive methods of combat, but the virus
powder #11l doubtless-serve all practi
cegno
The Tames-Picayune gave a hint o
the discovery months ago, and it was
formally presented to the medical and I
scientific world in the customary
manner. But that did not mean its
general adoption and introduction.
Drs. Couret and Duval went to
Washington and tendered the knowl
edge and use of the immu'hizing dose
to the Nation. The congressional
committee hesitated about the matter
until it was informed that the Louisi
ana experts were scientists in the
truest sense of the word, and desired
neither remuneration nor profit for
themselves, but were willing to turn
over their formula for free use
and manufacture under proper au
spices. This was followed by prompt
request for demonstration to the sat
isfaction of the government scientists.
The test in Iowa was accordingly ar
ranged and the Orleanians have gone
thither to conduct the trials. The
Iowa experiment station is also le
eated at Ames, and has done much
work with hogs. As the powder has
proven its efficiency in experiments in
New Orleans and at Baton Rouge it is
almost positive the same results will
be obtained with swine in Iowa.
As soon as the hog serum matter is
settled. and the farmers enjoy the
full benefit of the boon, Dr. Couret
will likely undertake the conquest of
the foot-and-mouth disease and char
boa, the main foes of the American
rattle business. The same principle
will undoubtedly prove efficient, the
task consisting in the treatment of
the virus so that it can be economFcal
IV nroduced and 7saf~ely haandled.
TESTED AND PROVEN.
There is a Heap of. Solace in Being
Able to Depend Upon a Well
Earned Reputation.
For months Donaldsonville readers
have seen the constant expression of
praise for Dean's Kidney Pills, and
read about the good work they have
done in this locality. What other
remedy ever produced such convinc
ing proof of merit?
C. Simoneaux, Barton, La., says:
"I had gradually run down from kid
ney disease until finally I was given
up to die. My limbs were swollen to
twice their natural size and I was
bloated all over. Doctors were
afraid that dropsy would reach my
heart, but couldn't help me. My
back pained me greatly and the kid
ney secretions were scanty in passage
and unnatural. After I had taken
five boxes of Doan's Kidney Pills, I
was well. My limbs returned to their
normal size and the kidney secretions
cleared up. Since then I haven't suf
fered in the least."
