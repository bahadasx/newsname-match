Kl I'nso, Tex., April 14. The mys
tery over what really happened at
I'hithI. where American troops are
reported to have clashed with Mexicans'
on Wednesday, became more baffling
than ever tonight, due to the hitow- I
ing variety of conflicting reports
which poured into Kl Paso from
every conceivable and many incon
ceivable. Jiolnts.
There was one point which was def
inlle: Amessnge was received here
by tin American concern from its rep
resentative In Parral stating that at
5 o'clock Wednesday evening Ameri
can soldiers were passim? through
l'arral and that everything was quiet
then.
More Probable Story.
As 'ho fighting- between the Ameri
cans and Mexicans is reported to hnvo
occurred some time on Wednesday,
this message only served to make the
situation more perplexing. The most
plausible explanation was offered in
un account of the affair brought here
today by an American from Chihui
hua City. This man said the trouble
started when two American soldieis
were sent Into Parral by Major Tomp
kins to make arrangements for the
purchase of supplies. Their presem o
aroused the people of the city, wh.j
had already been violently agitated by
reports that thi advancing American
troops were going to take possession
of the town. V
. Attacked by Mob.
The two soldiers were surrounded
by an angry mob and in the excite-j
meat u shot whs fired which killed!
one of them. The mob then
nonre l i
out in the direction of the main bcly
of the Americans and some indiscrim
inate fighting took place in which a
number of Mexicans were wounded.
The Carranza garrison assisted in re
storing order, according to this ac
count and later the Americans passed
quietly through the city.
Wild Reports Cft-clilatcd.
' This report was given a good ileal
of '.redetiee here on account of it3
sourc", hut there was no possibility of
verifying it any more than any of the
other reports, which ranged from :i
complete massacre of the American
soldiers to a bloodier massacre of
Mexicans.
General Gavira said tonight that he
had received no reports to indicate
the Parral incident had inflamed' the
people in the district over which he
commands,
Villa Stronghold,
"It must be remembered that Par
ral has been one of Villa's strongholds
and contains many Villistas," he said.
"When the Americans approached it
would have been an easy matter for
these Villistas to make the ignorant
believe that the Americans Intended to
capture and hold their town. This
evidently happened."
(Invira said he had receive no oth
er telegrams, official or formal, relat
ing to the Parral affair.
News reached headquarters today
that the Presena ranch In the Parral
district was robbed yesterday by ban
lits, who, however, did not shed any
blood.
