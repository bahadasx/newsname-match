Kenneth Turrner, ataff corres
pondent of the Appeal to Rcna n
sends tins atory from Hi Paeo
Tevr.s:
I have found out the reason for
the strict military cenaorahlp
a I ms the border,
There are two auch reason I
First, in order to conceal what
happened at Oolumbua; second. In
order to conceal what is Intende l
to happen in the future.
it is true that thn real facts of
the Columbus affair have never
i. ii published, tint censorship Is
Intended to prevent their becom
ing known, and finally, that the
Invasion of Mexico which foll"W
ed was framed up as a part of
the scheme to conceal the fact
colonel Slocum and three h in
died soldiers were camped at Col
umbus for the purpose of guard
Ing ti nt part of the 1 order Villa
in flight from Carransa troop
ran northward, swearing that h
would cause Intervention by kill"
Ing Americans. Three days before
tie raid the Mexican COUSUl tl
1.1 Pnson otified General Pershlnx
In command at Fort iuiss. that
Villa and four hundred men were
within I If teen miles of the border.
Two days before the raid Colo-
; Slocum was notified that VlHu
was coming to attack Columbu
One day before the rai l Colcmol
Slocum was notified that Villa
was coming to attack Colun ' -Two
hours .'cft.ro the raid Colom
glocum was awakened from sleep
ind told that Villa was about '.
attack Columbus, Blocuin's repb
to bis informant wn: "GET TO
HELL OUT OF HERE AND LET
ME SLEEP."
On the night of tho raid a ma
jority of Colonel Slooum's officer
were In El Paso attending a wed
ding, others were with their
wives in rented houses at a cou
stderable distance from the camp,
The army ri:'is were locked up
and the man in charge of tho:t.
was ti'l not to give them out ex
tent on nn order from me com
manding office;-. When the sol
diers rushed for their guns tin :
had to push the sentry asid and
kick down the door
Villa did not attack the mili
tary camp. His attack w.n
a complete surprise and he was i:
a j'-;tion to masacre th entire
town. Including the American
troops.
But his raid was only a play to
provoke intervention. Instead of
Wiping Out Colonel Slocum and his
men, Villa's soldiers looted sonic
houses and then "'.-treated. The
nvmber killed whs lame because
they were caught In disorder and
surprised by a cavalry troop re
timing from the border gate
seme distance south.
Such is the story told by I ;
Pas ' new spa pi rmen. who nr. in a
petition to know, but who dare
not publish the facts in their owi
papers or under their own niur.
Colonel Slocum demand' ! that
Wilson order a pursuit of Villa in
the hope that such a movi would
cover hu press dereliction ol dutj
and save him from eourtmarshal
On the day that this is written a
Washington dispatch says that no
detailed report has .v et been mad a
or required of the Columbus af
fair on account of the officers be
ing busily engaged in the pursuit
or Villa!
Alien L. Benson. Socialist nom
inee for president, sums up the
Mexican situations ns follow:'
"The President of the United
StateB,on March 2". 1016, felt it
necessary to issue a statement,
oxer his signature warning the
people of the United States not
to heed the lying reports pub
llsjbsd in the American press with
regard to our relations with
Mexico.
Mr. Wilson specifically said that
"The object of this traffic. In
falsehood is to create Intolerable
friction between the government
of the United States and the de
facto government of Mexico for
the purpose of bringing about in
tervention in the Interest of cer
tain American owners of Mexican
properties,
In Other words We arc told n,
the President of the United states
that certain American gentlemen
Who own cattle ranges, forests
and mines In Mexico arc ho de-.ir-
OUS that their property shall bo
Increased in price that they are
eager to exchange American
hlood for Mexican treasure, and
that a considerable part of the
American press is willing to He
to bring about the desired result
These are astonishing State
n cuts Coining, as thev do. from
the White Bouse, they will at
tract the widest attention.
Hut tit) the American people he
lieve this is the first occasion
iijion which American capitalists
have sought to control the gov
ernment to serve their own self-
ish interests'.'
Do the Aemrlcan people believe
this is the first time American
capitalists have tried to force the
American government to hurt th
poor tl at ill-' rich may be helicd.
)o ti t1 American people oelleve
this is the first time thai Ameri
can newspapers have lied to fur
ther th scheme : the rich?
If to, ti e American people Wo lid
do well to open their pyeii t the
facts.
What President Wilson, over hi
si nature, has proclaimed to eve
rybody, is not a new thing, but
a very, very old thing
Every minute of every hour or
every day. the capitalist interests
tl at control this government are
using it to entrench the rich In
their riches, which necessarily
means the keeping of the ro-i of
the people bard at work for a
bare liv ing.
T ie American ress controlled
by the interests that are fatten
ing upon the masses, and dally
defends whatever helps the rich
and attacks whatever menace

T;ie American press has not
been doing tu:-se thing- for
day or a week or a month it
has been doing them ever sin
there was an American press
Tne American press has not s id

All merchants and most man i

and
quick turnovers in their '. k.
but with slow freight shlpmeu -it
is Impossible to do this
Railroads, in order to Increase
their earnings per train mile, are
loading their locomotives with
very car that they pan posslbh
pull
Trains arc not made up a dl
I visions or terminal points until 9
sufficient number of loaded caw
are accumulated In the terminal
to make up the full tonnage ol the
loci 'motive, cars containing mer
chandise are held up at terminal
.points to make up a long train,
i when it is remembered that

at each, point, it can readily
I be seen how serious the aggre

long trams arc finally made up
at each division point they are

aloiw the road at a snail's

oftentimes the sidings will not
hold thorn ami at meeting points
between two train.-, on single
track railroads more time is lost
by tl,o trains having to saw 1 in .
Under the present ten hour daj
system there la n penalty for
working a man overtime; conse
quently If train crews are kepi
on the road longer than ten hours
there is no extra payment made
for overtime oilier than the regu
lar payment per hour that th"
trainmen got before the ton hours
expired, Under the present way
of paying for overtime it is of lit
tle consequence to the railway
companies whether they work th.'
crews ton hours or fifteen hours
and fifty minuter as one more car
of freight added to the train will
more It ban make up for the wages
paid the men by keeping them on
the road longer hours
If the demand of the men fe.r
an eight hour day. with payment
of tune and one-half for overtime
is granted, the railroads will see
to it that there is very little over
time and will move their trains
faste". and if necessary make
Shorter trains to get them over
the road quicker and cut out all
unneccessary delays
So long as the workers take the

H0W SMART WE ARE.
Tiie working nan nas boon tola
so often by the foxy politicians
that he ;a smart, that most of
them have grown to believe it.

Manufacturers' Association and
other corrupt sources, he g os out
among the dear pee-p-epul to tell

(confidence by flattery by telling
j how happy lie is to be greeted by

I Every sticker In the crowd grins,
stretches his neck In nn effort to
look wise, and says to himself. "He
was looking right at me."
Then the spell-binder goes on,

the young men from the towns
flocked to the fields to follow the
harvest and earn money. They'd
start here and follow t::e har st
into Minnesota. But this flocking
has all changed. The young men
are going from the farm to town
to the factory!
The opportunities that wore
once here for the strong back and
