AT PARRAL
American Soldiers Were Attemnt

FLED BEFORE ANGRY MOB
Pursuer Met With Fire of . Machine
Gun and 40 of Them Reported
Killed
San Antonio, Tex., April 15. The
Americans on whom the Mexicans at
Parral fired were unarmed, according
to an unconfirmed version of the inci
dent current Ln Chihuahua and trans
mitted here to Gen Funston yesterday.
According to this story, 40 of the troop
ers entered Parral, presumably to buy
supplies, and were flred upon. Two
were killed and the remainder retreat
ed to the main body of troops encamp
ed outside the city. The attacking
force pursued them and was met by a
fire from the Americans, who were us
ing a machine gun, killing 40 Mexi
cans. According to this story, the at
tacking parry comprised Carranza sol
diers and civilians.
This report of the Parral Incident
was sent by Consul Letcher from Chi
huahua to Gen. Dell. at El Paso, who
forwarded it to Gen Funston. Full al
lowance was given by departmental
officers to Consul Letcher's qualifying
words "unconfirmed version that was
current" In Chihuahua, but there was
manifested a disposition to credit the
report.
Many of the officeres at headquart
ers In San Antonio regarded the story
of the affair as more probable than
some of the versions which have come
out of Mexico. It was pointed out that
In previous cases Boldiers had entered
towns for the purpose of buying sup
plies and had been received in a
friendly mannor by the residents, and
that if they had gone into Parral for
that purpose, it was probable that
they went unarmed.
FRANCE WANTS MORE MONEY
Seeks Loan of $200,000,000
Through
J. P. Morgan & Co.
New York, April 15. The French
Government Is negotiating with J. P.
Morgan & Co., and associated bankers
for placing In this country a compre
hensive new loan, out of the proceeds
of which payment will be made for
both Government and commercial
purchases. Gossip In the financial
district has It that discussions are
turning on a credit of about 200,000
000, but no amount has been agreed
upon nor has the form which the loan
will take been decided.
Octave Homberg, the financial rep
resentative of the French Government
in this country, said yesterday that it
was true, as he said some weeks ago,
that no negotiations had then been en
tered Into, and that there had accord
ingly been no delays in the matter.
He said the French Government's fin
ances, as regards obligations due In
the United States, had always been in
a comfortable position, and that there
was no haste necessary now In agree
ing upon terms. From the French
Government's share of the $480,000,
000 raised by means of the Anglo
French loan there remains unexpend
ed between $30,000,000 and $40,000,

States as it Is needed. Most import

OUR LAST WORD
10 GERMANY
Berlin Government Will be Told it
Doesn't Keep Promises
CONSIDER EVIDENCE CONCLUSIVE
Change Of Attitude Alone Can Avert
i Threatened Break of
Relations.
Washington, April 15. President
Wilson and the cabinet went over the
submarine crisis again yesterday and
reaffirmed their determination to
bring the situation with Germany to
an issue. The decision to inform Ger
many that recent accumulation of evi
dence of ships destroyed in submarine
warfare leads to the inevitable con
clusion that her promises to tho Unit
ed StateB are not being fulfilled, re
mained unchanged. The time of dis
patching a communication to Merlin
appeared to be the only point undecid
ed. In Congress yesterday a report was
widely circulated that the forthcom
ing note would in itself give notice of
a severance of diplomatic relations.
There was nothing to substantiate the
story anywhere In official quarters.
There were repeated indications
last night that the note would be a
statement of the American case up to
date, without anything in the nature
of an ultimatum, and still would leave
the way open for Germany to avoid
the long-feared break in diplomatic
relations. It was plain, however,
that it would be intended as the Ameri
can government's last word.
At the state department there was
renewed evidence that the United
States considers its case complete,
even without the affidavits which ar
rived yesterday on the steamer St.
Paul.
The impression which officials per
mitted to prevail was that the note to
Germany would not go forward until
all the evidence had been carefully
considered, but that enough was at
hand to make up the American case.
Some officials declared the communl
cation would go within 48 hours.
In all official quarters there is evi
dence cf the gravity of the situation
All officials agree that the accumula
tion of evidence has brought the sit
uation between the two countries to
the point of a break or a decided
change on Germany's part.

New ork," April 15. Clews, which
will lead to the identity of the men
hlghe'u&",-ho' furnished the money
for the alleged .conspiracy to manu
facture and distribute bombs to de
story munitions ships, for which eight
men are under arrest, are expected by
the federal authorities to bo revealed
through tho examination of the bank
accounts of Dr. Walter T. Scheelc.
who Is now being sought. A national
bank examiner will arrive at New
York from Washington today, Assist
ant United States District Attorney
Roger G. Wood said last night, to in-
estigate six accounts carried by Dr.
Scheele in banks In Hoboken, N. J.
"If anybody handled the big sums it
was Scheele and we hope to be able
to find where ho get it," Mr. Wood
said. Scheele was the head of the
New Jersey agriculture and chemical
company at Hoboken, where it Is al
leged tho explosive materials were
placed in the bombs after they had
been constructed aboard the North
German Lloyd steamship Friedrich
der Grossc, interned at Hoboken. He
disappeared from his apartment in
New Ycrk on April 1. The author
ities are also interested in locating his
secretary, Miss Ruth Foss. whom they
wish to examine.
Additional developments in the in
tstlgation of the alleged conspiracy
are expected also from Savannah
New Orleans and other cities as the
result of an examination of Dr.
Steele's effects. Federal authorities
iu these cities were directed yester
day to begin investigations based on
information already at hand that the
destruction of ships had also been at
tempted in their jurisdiction.
All except three of the eight men
under arrest have made confessions
Mr. Wood said. Capt. Otto Wolpert,
superintendent or the Atlas piers of
the Hamburg-American line, accused
of receiving completed bombs; Capt.
Snno Hode, superintendent cf the
Hamburg-American line piers at Ho
boken and Carl Schmidt, chief en
gineer of the interned German liner
Friedrich der Grosse, have refused to
make any statements to tho federal
authorities. "The silence of these
three men," Mr. Wood said, 'indicate
they are probably the most important
prisoners of the eight we have ar
rested.'
The five men who are said to have
revealed their knowledge and alleged
complicity in the plots are Krnest
Decker, electrician of the Friedrich
de Grosse; Capt. Charles von Kleist,
superintendent of the New Jersey
agriculture and chemical company at
Hoboken where the explosives are
said to have been placed In the

STflIKE BREAKERS OUSTED
Near Riot at Pawlet Where Slate
Quarries Are on Strike.
Rutland, April 14. As the outcome
of an appeal from Thomas Nelson, a
well-known Pawlet slate manufactur
er, Sheriff Enos C. Fish of West Rut
land today obtained authority from the
office of Gov. Charles W. Gates to
swear in as many special deputies as
might be needed to assist the regular
men In keeping peace among the strik
ers in the slate belt, a near approach
to riot conditions having been reached
today. Tho first trouble since the pit
men quit Wednesday, causing about
600 men to be idle because of lack of
material, occurred this morning when
strike breakers attempted to move
slate which was ready for delivery.
The strikers took their teams, unhar
nessing the horses and leading them
away. No serious fights took place.
Sheriff Fisli had seven regular depu
ties on the ground all of last night
and this afternoon he and State's At
torney C. V. Poulin went to the strike
zone. The manufacturers have rectiv
assurance that they will be given
protection by the county authorities
and the same is true In Washington
county, New York, Granville being in
cluded in the present strike. Cutters
and others have Joined the strikers in
demand for higher wages. At first
the Pit men wanted two cents un hour
advance. Now there is said to be a
general demand for live cents.
The concerns principally affected
by the strike are Norton Bros., F. C.
Sheldon Slate company and the Nelson
Slate company.

Thus the ox eyed daisy is a weed, even

OUR TROOPS EXCITE PEOPLE
Difficult to Convince Inhabitants That
Their Country is Not Being
Invaded.
Mexico City, April 15. The Mexi
can government will insist with inflex
ible determination that any armed ex
pedition of tho United States which
enters Mexican territory in the guise
of a punitive expedition must be limit
ed to 1000 men of one service along,
cavalry, according to a statement
made to the Associated Press yester
day by Juan Xeftali Amador, sub-secretary
of foreign relations. During the
absence of Gen. Candido Aguilar, min
ister of foreign relations, in Quere
taro, Sub-Secretary Amador is in
charge of the foreign office and is con
ducting its course in international af-
air.v
"The Mexican government has con
tended in all of its notes to the Wash
ington state department", said the
sub-secretary, "that the sending of
heavy artillery and slow-marching in
fantry on a punitive expedition is il
logical, and that the work of the pres
ent so-called punitive expedition has
more than demonstrated this, for they
have accomplished absolutely nothing.
Mexico will and has in all of its com
munications to Washington insisted
that all punitive expeditions must be
limited to certain restricted areas.
The request of the United States that
the present expedition be considered
exceptional cannot be agreed to bv
the Mexican government for the very
good reason that each day its presence
so far inland does but excite our peo
ple. This is being taken advantage of
by enemies of the constitutionalist
government who are endeavoring to
stage incidents that will cause grave
international complications.
The Parral incident is a case in
point. 1' consider this happening the
last drop in the bucket and believe
that when the American people and
the American government realize its
full significance they will gladly ac
cede to Mexico's request and, in the
traditional friendship which exists be
tween the two countries, will with
draw the troops.
"No one has ever questioned t ho
honesty of the purpose of the United
States iu limiting the present military
movement to a punitive nature, but it
Is hard to convince the population
that force of thousands of men of
three branches of the service do not
have the semblance of invaders. The
Mexican government believes In the
friendship of the United States and
believes that the present crisis will
pass, leaving relations more cordial
than ever."
Gen. Carranza asked to be excused
from discussing International ques
tions, and referred the correspondent
to the foreign office, which, he said,
was fully authorized to present tho
views of himself and his government.
Sub-Secretary Amador then explained
Mexico a position. -

Campfire Girls Successfully Pro-
duce "The Little Princess"
AUDIENCE LAUGHED AND WEPT
Comedy and Pathot Effectively Por
trayed at Library Hall Last
Evening.
"The Little Princess", which was
presented to the .public last night un
der the auspices of the Tahkoneac
.Camp Fire was an unqualified success,
financially as well as dramatically.
An audience? ol over 400 people, com
posed ol, parents and friends interest
ed in. die promotion of Camp Fire
work, witnessed the production. From
tho rise of the curtain on the first act,
exclamations of approval and favor
able comments could be heard over the
entire hall and this response was ap
preciated by the young people behind
the footlights most of them for the
first time. Many people present were
amazed at the dramatic ability shown
by children so young, nearly all of
them being under 15 years of age.
All the parts were so uniformly well
taken that it is dillicult to pick out
special stars but particular mention
must be made of Auastasla Fitzgerald
as "The Little Princess" who rendered
that very long and difficult part with
wonderful spontaneity and sympathy.
That tears were brought to the eyes
of the spectators repeatedly by her
interpretation showed real art and
utllit.
The comedy part3 of Ermengarde,
the stupid but good-natured girl of
the school, taken by Lillian Levin and
eckie, the scullery maid taken by
Kleanor Hutton were extremely well
dune and brought forth gales . of ,
laughter from the audience. The dif
ficult role of Lavinla, the spiteful and
wsty Jnarding school miss , was very-"
ably played by Alice Brown. Lois
Kstes played the part of Miss Minchin,
tie catty boarding school proprietress.
Each part was good In its own way
and all deserve mention but lack of
space does not permit.
The play was coached by Mrs. Ar
thur Eliott and most of its success is
due to her faithful and untiring ser
vice. Too much cannot be said of
Mrs. Eliott's ability as a dramatic
each. A great many pretty pictures
and tabelaux were formed by efiective
groupings and lighting effects. The
scenery was planned and built by Ned
llealey, William Braisted and Carl
ton Davis. In the second act, especial
ly good, a garret scent was made with
a dormer roof and window. Winches
ter Fnimons assisted in shifting scen
ery.
As the spectators came up the
stairs, an attractive candy booth which
was designed by Helen Carpenter.
greeted them and the proceeds from
this added materially to the Camp Fire
tic usury. The booth was in charge of
Elizabeth Goodall, Elizabeth Turner,
Helen Carpenter and Elizabeth Cron
in. Another pleading feature was the
programmes with the Camp Firn
insignia, the crossed logs and flame
dene In water colors by hand on tho
utside
Florence Godfrey acted as stage
manager and Miss Mary Elizabeth
Itol'injcn as prompter. Elsa Walh-
quist served as head usher and was
assisted by Harriet Walbridge, Bea
trice Bixby, Kuth Burke. Mary Hur
ley, Helen Denley end Mnnola Lynch.
On the whole the venture proved
most worth-while5 from the points of
view of both spectators and actors and
incidentally the Camp Fire treasury is
appreciably reimbursed. The Camp
Fire girls take this opportunity to
thank the public (or its loyal support
and interest.
