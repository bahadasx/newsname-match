Fioht Second Battle at Parral
NOW WATCH
THAT CURSE
COME OFF!
All Tacomans who are out to see that the mountain gets back its right
name will not fail to miss the big Justice to the Mountain meeting called by
the Commercial club in the club rooms for next Tuesday evening.
Announcement of the meeting was made today by Dr. Ernest C. Wheeler,
president of the Commercial club.
The Justice to the Mountain club will be there. All boosters for the
mountain, all who have been lukewarm on the subject, all who have a spark
of interest in giving the mountain a square deal are invited.
It is to be an open meeting. |i
A number of speakers who have lived in Tacoma a long while and who
are close friends and supporters of the mountain's real name have ben proe
cured. They will tell what the Justice to the Mountain club is for, and how the
people of Tacoma can get busy.
• Up-to-the-minute election returns will be on tap.
Also plans of the Tacoma Speedway association will be discussed.
It's to be a lively affair all around. Now everybody turn out.
JUST SEE WHAT THEY SAY!
By Sam Wall
The Justice to the. Mountain
club is about to crystali/.e the
sentiment and enthusiasm that
has been aroused through several
- Mioulhs of agitation over the
question of the Mountain's name,
and will furnish the machinery
through which the greatly de
sired consummation is to he
reached.
Applications for charter mem
bership not only have come in in
"bunches, but in many cases the
aigued coupon has been accom
panied by strong words of approv
al. Thus from
MAI'RICE LANGHORNE, law
yer, of the firm of Haydcn, Lang
home A. Metzger:
"I see that W. H. Paulhanius
says that when you started this
campaign his first throught waa
that you were a fool. I wish to
say that my first thought was one
eyf immense satisfaction in that a
of Tacoma had been found
with nerve enough to go after
this thing.
"More Power," He Says
"Seeing the manner In which
Hits campaign has been conducted
throughout, I am not surprised,
as he says he is, at the result. I
•have talked over this matter with
very many citizens of Seattle and
1 have myself found a state of
open-mlndedness, a freedom from
prejudice, an Indifference as to
the matter of an actual and out
spoken willingness to renounce
the name 'Rainier,' such as quite
<ftepared me for the results you
got by probing a bit.

There are many influential citi

of thinking, and if tbe Justice

It properly, as I am sure it will,
they will all be coming in as
members.

GEN. JAMES 11. ASHTON—
"The Justice to the Mountain club
is ail right aud 1 'want to belong,'
but the fact is, this is a matter
that long ago ought to have been
taken up by the Commercial club.
I know very well those people in
Seattle are ready to treat with
us on this subject.
"I am going to bring this be
fore the Commercial club myself.
We will draw up a letter sub
mitting the proposition to the Se
attle Chamber of Commerce, call
ing for a conference. We can
easily come to terms, I am sure."
Eye-Opener to Old Timer
BENATOR JESSE JONKS: "I
can't quite understand the Indif
ference hitherto manifested by
the Commercial club in this mat
ter, which everybody is so deeply
interested In. I am glad you
have begun your independent
movement —The Justice to the
Mountain club—and I am apply
ing for charter membership—but
also 1 am going to take this mat
ter up with the .Mothers' Council
of the Commercial club. I have
watched your campaign with

ELMER DOVER, Tacoma Gas

splendid thing and I hope to see

A. H. DEN'MAN, lawyer—"You
know where I am on this matter.
I shall be at the meeting and will
do all 1 can always."
ISAAC ANDERSON—"I wish
you success. The campaign has
been an eye-opener to the old

would have to stand for "Rainier *
to the end of the chapter."

tbe misnaming of the mountain.
I hope you will be given such sup
port as will lead to the successful

MRS B J. ELLIS, Colfax—"As
I wrote in ii letter recently, 'I be
lieve if Tacoma would go after
this affair (and others) in the
spirit that Seattle displays, when
she goes after what she wants,
she would bring home the bacon."

NEW YORK, April 15. Keeping pace with the
high cost of living, the high cost of KILLING has be
gun to soar!
New Yorkers purposing the purchase of murder
find it 400 per cent more expensive today than three
years ago!
These arc revelation! outstanding today from
testimony in the first phase of the Baff murder <•«*<•.
a ease more sensational in its showing up of murder
by contract than was the Becker case, although it
lias attracted hardly a tenth of the public interest
aroused l>v the ooliee lieutenant's trial.
Exactly $4200 is what it cost supposedly re
spectable business men to buy the assassination,
about a year ago, of their business rival, Baret
Baff, wealthy poultry dealer whose operations
were imperiling their profits.
These sceptics who have
thought the professional gunman
of Colhani a inylh exploited for
the sake of the movies, have now
seen their mistake during the
trial of Giuseppe Arli hiello,
charged with firing the shot that
killed Baff.
Carmine di Paola, called the
'college boy gunman," testified
against Aric hiello and revealed
the method by which a person
may contract for the killing of
another without danger to him
self.
In Hie Baff case, Ippolito Gre
co, known as the proprietor of the
notorious "murder stable," about
which have clustered lit assassi
nations in the last four years, was
charged with being the go-be
tween with whom higher-ups ar
ranged for killings.
Greco, according to testimony,
had a regular staff of gangsters,
lie staged the Baff shooting, and
Kept $1,00(1 for his services, three
"lookouts" got 1300 each, one
gunmen $l."i 0, Arichiello $100.
