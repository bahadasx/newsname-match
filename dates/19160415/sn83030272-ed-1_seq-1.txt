FIRE BOMB TRAIL MAY
LEAD TO POWDER MILLS
Search of Missing Dr. Scheele's Laboratory Reveals Ex
plosives and Materials That Suggest More Extensive
Activities Than Plots to Burn Ships.
Clues furnished by a search of Pi. 1
Waller T. Scheele's laboratory In
llohokcu, where tire bombs for the de
Miuetlon of merchantmen nre said to
have been assembled, have led the fed
eral and local police authorities to be
lieve that out of the arrests of eight Her
mans in the lire bomb case may come still
moie staining revelations concerning de
stiuctlvo wo.k In munition and powder
factories In this country, commonly
ascribed to German secret ngents.
Neither the Department of Justice nor
Capt. Tunney of the bomb squad, whose
remarkably persistent detective work
caused the arrests In the ship tire mys
teries, would make any additional
eiiargo yesterday against Dr. Schcele,
who has vanished, nor would any one
admit the details of the confessions
made by (he of the eight men under
Hriest or (ell of the ast amount of evi
dence obtained on the Frledrleh der
Grosse, In lr. Scheele's laboratory and
In the homes of the other men placed
under arrest.
It was learned, however, that Lieut.
Gcurgt Husby, Detective Steiett of the
local iKillce force and Detective Klely
of the Ilohokcii force had found a great
amount of startling material In Dr.
S.-hrcic's laboratory.
I'lnil MnuLrlen I'nwiler.
Dr. Scheele's professed work In the
laboratory was tho making of fertilizer.
Since the arrest of his assistants It has
been learned, llrst. that ho used tin labo
rntoi.i to mix oil with fertilizer as a
means of smuggling it into Gcim.iny,
and secondl., to assemble lire bombs to
be placed. It Is charged, on ships through
the aid of Opt. otto Wolpeit and ('apt.
Kilo llodc, both connicted Kith the Hamburg-American
Steamship Company.
The materials found by the detectives
.csterday suggest that .Ur. Scheele's ac
tivities were even more extensive ami
mysterious In the first place, a large
amount of smokeless powder was found
storeil away In the laboratory, presum
ably owned by the New Jersey Agrlcul
in ul and flu mlcal Company. Also there

FLETCHER'S SHIPS
TO BE IN PORT TODAY
Washington, April 11.- In view of
the iesent International situation the
Atlantic battleship fleet will be held In
readiness to put to sea on short notice.
A statement to thlH effect was made
to.day by an ofllccr of the Navy De
partment.
j The fleet, under command of Admiral
. Fletcher, Is on Its way north from Guan-
tanamo and Is expected to reach Hamp
ton Ko.itls to-morrow. The schedule
calls for the vessels to then disperse and
to to their home yards, where the men
will get shore leave and repairs of a
minor character will be made.
This does not mean that the ships are
In bad condition, but simply that ccrtnln
routine repair work will be undertaken
while the ships have their bottoms
"craped and nre put In good shape after
an extended period of sea service,
I'nder normal conditions this work

the Heel's schedule called for the ves-
I() Pae liuai.inamo for mameu
vres earl In the month.
The Navy Department would have pre.
(eired to have hail the vessels tcmaln In
closer pio.xlmity to Mexican isirts, In
stead of coming north, but the State De
partment felt that no change should be
ordered which might arouse the su-
piclons of the people In Mexico,

Consequently Admiral Fletcher had or-
