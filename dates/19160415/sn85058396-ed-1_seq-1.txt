' MEXICAN SITUATION UNCHANGED
! AND VILLA CHASE CONTINUES
1 General Pershing Not Heard From in Three Days Officials
j Doubt Seriousness of Parral Clash' Early Mexican Dis-
i patches Doubted More Troops at Border Prepare
I io Cross Into Mexico.
f
' Washington, April 15. Secretary
; Lansing pronounced the Mexican sit-
uation unchanged today in any aspect.
j Unless official reports to Gen. Fun
j ston disclose a more grave situation
! at Parral. where American troops
were fired upon, than 1b now believed
to exist, there was nothing to indi
; cato that a change might be expected
in the near future.
Secretary Baker said Gen. Funston
had not heard from Gen. Pershing di
rectly for three days. That caused
no uneasiness at the war department,
however, as Gen. Pershing has re
ported only when he had definite and
important information to communi-
cafe.
Doubt Seriousness of Parral Clash.
As time passes without official in
formation of the Parral fighting from
American sources, officials are in-
'. clined to doubt that the clash was as
! serious as described in early Mexican
' advices.
Publication in Mexico City of the
terms the Carranza government seeka
to Impose, limiting any reciprocal
, troop movements acroBB the boundary,
! sheds much light on the diplomatic
j ' (angle which preceded Gen. Carranza's
' ! suggestion that the American troops
i ' bo recallod from Mexico.
! Secretary Lansing declined to dis
cuss the matter. At the time the de
facto government suggested that no
i expeditionary force should exceed
1,000 cavalrymen and not cross a
; deadline, there were several thousand
American troops of all arms in Mexi
i co and they were 200 miles or more
! south of the border.
Reassuring Advices Received.
Reassuring advices from American
consuls in touch with interior Mexican
points led officials to hope that there
is now little danger that news of the
I Tecent fight at Parral would arouse
resentment among the Mexican peo
ple which might lead to further com
plications. Washington, April 15. State de
partment dispatches from El Paso to
day refer to uninformed reports of a
second fight with American troops
at Parral.
General Funston today telegraphed
the war department that he had not
beard from General Pershing for
' three days Secretary Baker said
' that General Funston was urging
; general Pershing to rush a report on
the Parrel Incident,
i General Funston's message was
taken to indicate that the silence of
General Pershing probably was due to
inabllitv to get information rather
than to interruption of communica
tion. General Funston has been in
communication with other authorities
In close touch with the advance expe
dition but had asked General Persh
ing to report oftener if possible to
keep the war department advised.
Secretary Baker said he still was
waiting for a report on ,the confer
ences between General Pershing and
Generals Herrera and Gutierrez.
State, department officials todaj
were prenared to set in motion dipio
, malic machinery for a discussion
with General Carranza of his proposal
for the withdrawal of the American
troops from Mexico. While the nego
tiations are under way. the hunt lor
Francisco Villa will continue.

's ambassador here, said today ne
had no further Information of ine
fighting at Parral nor of reports of a

UNEASiNESS AT
FUNSTflN'S CAMP
Pershing's Unbroken Silence
Concerning Fight at Parral
Brings Sharp Call
For Report.
CO-OPERATION DENIED
Carranza's Troops Allow Vil-
listas to Pass Through Lines
Whenever Pressed by
Americans.
San Antonio, April 15. Uneasiness
was manifest at General Funston's
headquarters today, over General Per
shing's unbroken silence concerning
the fight at Parral. It becamo known
today that General Funston directed to
General Pershing last night, a com
munication sharply urging him to ex
pedite a report
General Funston received from tho
war department today, a rather long
communication, but he refused to dis
.cuss its character. There was reason
to believe the substance of his late
reports to Washington dealt largely
with tho positions and activities of
Carranza troops In northern Mexico
and the failure of them and other Car
ranze authorities to co-operate more
effectually with tho Americans.
Co-operation Is Denied.
Army fleers here and in Mexico
have resented the reper-3,1 statements
that co-operation was being given
when, as they indignantly assert, con
tinued refusal to use the railroads and
to permit the transmission of code
messages over the land wires has been
made. The number of Carranza
troops in northern and central Mexico
is Xar greater than that of the United
States force in Mexico, but, army of
ficers here pointed out, Villa has no
apparent difficulty in passing through
their lines when pressed forward by
the Americans.
It is believed that Goneral Funston
also called attention of the war de
partment to his inability to protect
more adequately the detached forces
at the front without materially weak
ening tho border patrol, or using the
railroads for troop movements.
Gomez Is Located.
General Pershing's chief of staff,
Lieutenant Colonel De R, C. Cabell, is
now at Casas Grandes, whore he went
to supervise the scouting work ordered
by General Funston, to ascertain the
movements of Carranza troops In the
region through which the line of com
munication passes. Reports today in
dicated that General Arnulfo Gomez's
troops are In the Bavalspo valley,
where thoy were being provisioned for
Held work
Three new companies of motor
trucks have arrived at Columbus, pro
viding the quartermaster's depart

UNITED STATES
READY TO ACT
Germany Will Be Informed
That Washington Govern
ment Considers Promises
Have Been Violated.
Washington, April 15. The United
States government today was ready
for its next step in the crisis with
Germany over submarine warfare.
This was the preparation of a com
munication to be sent to Berlin do
signed to bring the situation to an is
sue. The communication will go forward
within the next few days.
Indications aro, however, that the
United States' case against Germany
Is complete and that Germany will be
Informed that the Washington govern
ment considers she has not fulfilled
promises made to this country.
It is made clear that the forthcom
ing communication, although Intended
as tho final word of the United States,
will still leave the way open for Ger
many to avoid a severance of diplo
matic relations.
Secretary Lansing continued work
today on the statement of the Ameri
can case which will be forwarded to
Berlin and thus dispelled intimations
that It might already have been start
ed on Its way. Mr. Ianslng compared
the affidavits on the attack on the
Sussex which arrived here last night
with information already before tho

NATIONAL GUARD
DILL AMENDED
Senate Votes to Require
Guardsmen to Take Oath to
Obey President as Well
as Governor.
BORAH CHARGES GRAFT
Claims Money Now Annually
Appropriated Is Shamefully
Wasted Arouses Sena
tors by Aspersions.
. Washington. April 15 To further
strengthen federalization of the isa
tional Guard the senate today, by a
vote of 33 to 23, amended the army
reorganization bill to require guards
men to take an oath to obey the orders
of the president as well as the gov
ernor of their state.
The amendment was presented by
Senator Wadsworth, who Baid It ori
ginated In the National Guard Itself.
Sutherland Urges Amendment.
Senator Sutherland, Republican,
urged adoption of his amendment in
creasing tho coast artillery corps at
once to maximum strength.
"Our coast defenses have cost $11,
000,000 and are among the best In
the world," he said. "But, wo now
have enough men to man only one
fourth of the guns My amendment
would give us enough men to man one
half." Borah Arouses Senate.
Senator Borah, Republican, attack
ing federal pay for tho National
Guard, aroused the senate today, with
a charge that the $8,000,000 a year
no wappropriated by the government
for the National Guard, was "shame
fully wasted," and some of it "em
bezzled." "That's a pretty serious charge,"
said Senator Pomerene, Democrat, in
terrupting. No Benefit to Enlisted.
"Woll, 1 make It without any quali
fication," Senator Borah replied, and
he read from war department reports
to show that most of the fund had
been utilized by officers of tho Na
tional Guard for themselves and that
enlisted men had practically no benefit
of it.
"If senators here will examine the
record of these appropriations," Sen
ator Borah continued, "they will hesi
tate about appropriating $50,000,000
for the National Guard as It Is now
proposed to do.
"In Uils bill you are not appropriat
ing for war. You aro not giving the
people what they are expecting to pay
for We are filling this bill up from
beginning to end with purely political
appropriations and you couldn't pro
ceed a step under tho guise of na
tional preparedness."
National Guard Defended.
Senators Pomerene and Reed
staunchly defended the National
Guard.
"There may be a thief in the Na
tional Guard, but so there have been
in tho regular army, and senators
from this body have been sent to Jail,"
declared Senator Reed. "But I am
not willing to hear honorable men
maligned without sufficient provoca
tion." Lodge Defends Army.
Senator Lodgo defended the regular
army and declared It was time to stop
casting aspersions upon It.
"The regular army has fought and
won all our battles and is fighting for
us in Mexico today," he said, "and I
am sick and tired of hearing it at
tacked." On a vote Senator Sutherland's
amendment was defeated
Cummins Rebukes Borah.
Senator Cummins, Republican, said
he was shockod at Senator Borah's
statements.
"I do not believe the charges that
National Guard officers have misap
propriated the nation's money stolen
it for there Is no moral difference,"
he said. "I thing consideration of this
1111 should be halted while the senate
ascertains whether officers of the Na
tional Guard are guilty of such
charges."
Borah Supports His Charge.
Senator Borah, in support of his
charge, said
"I find, according to th report of
the war department, that in the Ohio
National Rifle match In 1911, $13,S92
was expended on tho state rifle team,
all of whom were officers, in the
period from July 22, 1911, to Sept. 23,
1912, a colonel drew pay to tho
amount of $1,411. In the period from
July 1, 1911, to Sept. 15, 1912, another
omccr also In the same state, a
colonel, drew pav to the amount of
$1,001.
"In the period from July 30, 19111,
to Sept. 1, 1913, a third colonel in that
state, drew pay to the amount of
$1,299. So the entire appropriation or
apportionment, to the state of Ohio
for this year practically went to the
offlcors and there is no report that any
portion of it is going to the enlisted
men."
Senator Borah stood by his state
ment In spite of a rush of senators to
defend tho guard of tholr own states.
"I do not know that thore are of
ficers of the 'National Guard whom I
would distrust personally," he said. "I
call the attention of senators that I
have not made a general charge. I
have said that the money appropriated
under tho Dick law has been shame
lessly used
"Let them disprove the-iiguresandi
