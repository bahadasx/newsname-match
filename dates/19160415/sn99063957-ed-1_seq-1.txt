SURVIVORS' AFFIDAVITS
REMOVE ALL DOUBTS
Members of House and Senate
Foreign Committees Will
Be Consulted
By Robert J. Bender,
(Coiled Press Stuff Correspondent.)
Washington, April 15. Final touches
were being put on tho new American
mite to Germany toilay. Secretary
Lansing is hard at work on affidavits
i'roni Americnns who survived the Sus
sex disaster. These documents were
forwarded to the slate department by
government representatives in Palis
and lyondnn. They will lie used as
"exhibits" jit connection with tile note.
If Lansing finishes his work on them
today be will confer with President
IWilson before night. The executive
will meet members of the house and
senate foreign committees after he has
gone over the note for the last time
with Lansing.
Lansing, it is understood, has agreed
to Senator Stone's suggestion to have
. republicans attend these conferences,
l-'innl plans for the meetings are not
decided, however.
It was indicated that the note would
be on its way to Berlin by Monday.
Affidavits from American survivors
of the disaster, which arrived by mail
aboard the liner St. Paul, were regarded
as convicting Germany of an unjusti
, i'ied attack, A conference between
.Senator Stone and Chairman Flood of
the house foreign committee was
scheduled, at which the ground on
which the present action is being taken
is to be examined and possible eventu
alities discussed. The proposition of
laying the whole matter before congress
will also be considered.
It was understood that the tentative
American note states such a position
that German' must make sweeping
change in its submarine policy, as in
no .other wav tan it give the assurance
a.-ked.
No Other Ships Near.
London, April 15. Germany's note
to the Vnited States leaves no further
doubt that the channel packet Sussex
was torpedoed, the British foreign of
fice declared today in an official state
ment. A thorough investigation has revealed
that no vessel in the channel except the
Sussex was damaged in the manner
was attacked at the exact moment the
described by the Gorman submarine
commander. Furthermore, the Sussex
commander says he hurled n torpedo at
n British mine layer in the channel near
where the Sussex was at that time.
The, German statement that the sub
marine captain thought that the ship
was one of the new mine layers of the
.Vabic type was not justified, sjiid the
foreign office, because the Sussex bore
no resemblance to vessels of the Arabic
class,
Nearly .130,000 people saw the eight

so if 20,0(10 see the Beavers play their
first game in Portland we will be some
what above the big league average.

I
ffewNHead of Industrial De
partment Knows What
Salem Needs
"With the cooperation of the in
dustrial department of the Commercial
club, I intend to put the flax industry
on its feet. It belongs to Salem. We
can grow it and manufacture it and i;
is my purpose to make flax a Salem in
dustry. I hope to organize n company
next spring or sooner that will handi"
the flax, busiaess like it is handled in
Belgium. If the industrial department
will stay with me, we will keep the
flax business right here in Salem,"
With this keynote speech of accept
ance, a-s director of the industrial de
partment of the Commercial club. Theo
dore Roth announced his policy for the
coming vear.
Theodore Roth, W. D. Allen and C. M.
Kppley were nominated for director at
the meeting of the department last ev
ening, Mr. Roth being elected on the
first ballot.
August Huckestoiif, the outgoing di
rector, reviewed the work of the year.
On account of the general finnncial
conditions, no new industries hail boen
brought to the city. Much had been
done in urging the people of Salem to
trade at home during the past year. Mr.
Huckesteiu commended the work of for
mer Manager O. H. Luck and the pres
ent manager, Ivan G. Daniel.
The meeting developed into a general
experience meeting and was one of the
most interesting held by the department
this year. L. W. Gleason of the Glen
son Glove company, stated that busi
ness was good and that he intended ta
increase the out put of his plant SO
per cent the coming year. The factory
already employs and has been grad
ually adding to its force since estab
lished a few years ago.
W. W. Iiosebrnugh, of the Anderson
Furnace company, informed the depart
ment that their business was growing,
and that recently they have made nr.
rnngemcnts with an experienced man to
take over the selling end of the busi
ness, which would greatly incernse their
output.
Carl Jepsen, who conducts a tannery
at 2,5(i" Oak street, said there was a big
demand for his goods but that just at
present it was hard to get the material
that enter into the tanning business, on
account of the war. However, he was
doing a satisfactory business, and ex
pected to gradually increase it.
"War luus knocked the stuffing out
of the baking powder business," said
V. M. F.pploy, "but we are going along
all right." He also expressed the opin
ion that the flax business should be a
great thing for Salem.
Mr. Huckesteiu and his associates
were given a vote of thanks for their
work the past year. Mr. Roth will be
come active director following the meet
ing of June 7 when the election of the
directors of the seven departments will
be ratified at a general meeting.
Charles E. Hughes In
Person Objects to Name
On Primary Ballot
A telegram was received by Secretary
of State Olcott this morning from
Charles K. Hughes in which th New
Vork Justice stated that he objected to
his name being placed on the primary
ballot and requesting that action be
withheld until a letter which was on
the road explaining his objections had
been received. This action of Justice
Hughes will probably postpone the fil
ing of th writ of mandamus to compel
Olcott to place Hughes' name on the
ballot as was proposed by the Hughes
faction in Portland.
The text of Hughes telegram follows:
"I was informed on April 1; that a
petition was about to be filed and at
once mailed to you statement of my
objections and my request that my
name shall not be placed on primary
ballot. Charles F. Hughes,

GENERAL FUNSTON SENDS
LONG CODE MESSAGE
Long Milnight Conference Be
tween Secretary of War
and Wilson
By Carl D. Groat.
(fiuted Press Staff Correspondent.)
Washington, April 15. Secretary
Lansing today sent Consul Rodgera in
Mexico City detailed instructions with
regard to General Carranza'a request
for withdrawal 'of American troops.
While he refused to announce the
character of these directions, it was
learned authoritatively that-Lansing in
formed Hodgers of the administration's
willingness to discuss tho proposition
with Ambassador Arredondo.
It was understood tiiat Rodgera was
not instructed to tre.t with Carranza,
but merely to inform him of Lansing's
decision to receive Arredondo 's over
tures. j Second Fight at Parr.il.
' Washington, April 15. A second
fight between Americans and residents
of Parral was reported today in con
sular dispatches to Kl Paso, forwarded
here. No details were given.
In General Funstou's long code mes
sage which wis the subject of a mid
night conference at tho White House
between the president and Secretary
Baker it is believed that radical chang
es in the Villa hunt were recommended.
Speculation as to Ha contents ranged
from requests for more troops to taking
over Mexican railways which are need
ed or reiterating the necessity of shift
ing the base of operations from Colum
bus. The message presumably related
to Funston 's orders to protect troops,
as a result of the Parral incident. It
contained no news of the Parral clash.
This is the fourth day Hinco the en
counter there and no' official news has
been received.
I Kevrettiry Ljnsiug'9 willingness to
treat with Ambassador Arredondo con
cerning the requested withdrawal may
'mean that preliminary negotiations will
be opened today or next week. While
Rome officials said no ciiange in the
Mexican policy was in flight, others be
lieved the negotiations might result in .1
j withdrawal of American troops.
Carranza'a protocol proposals, now
held up, show that the de facto govern-
meat chief sought to limit the Ameri
can expedition to 1,1100 cavalrymen who
I were not to occupy towns and who were
to withdraw when their object was at
tuned. The state department coun-
I tered with a demand that there be no
limitation in the size of tho expedition,
!and sought the actual cooperation of
the de Jacto regime.
Plans Are Not Changed.
Washington, April 15. Pressed for a
statement with regard to Cnrranzi's re
quest t lint American troops he with
drawn from Mexico, Secret iry of War
1 Baker said today:
I "The status of the expedition is as
it was at the beginning. There has
! been no change either in its purpose or
irs orders, and none is contemplated.
Carranza co operation continues and the
expedition continues."
Carranza At the Capital.
Washington, April 13. Advices re
ceived today by Ambassador Kliseo Ar

now has 125 men.
Wrivers of armv wagons reported 1
! state of anxiety along the lines of com
tnunictition since Carranza requested
that the troops withdraw. News of the
I request was flashed along the route of
tlie expedition's march. Commanders
: were ordered to use their own judg-
meat in any crisis nff'ecting tiie nifety
'of their detachments. General Kunston
i is in constant touch with the situation
I by field telegraph.
! Even the motor trucks have been or-
I dereil to keep close together. All must
', halt in case one is disabled. The tele
! graph office at Columbus was kept open
all night for the transmission of iinport
j nut government nnd military orders.

Crew Given 15 Minutes to Get
Away One Boat Is
Missing
Washington, April 15. The Aberdeen
bark Inverlyon, en route from Portland,
Oregon, to Limerick, was sunk by sub
marine gunfire on Tuesday, according
to reports here. Two Americans aboard
escaped. Some of the sailors were lost.
The reports came from the United
Slates consul at Queenstown. He also
advised the state department that the
Inverlyon did 1104 attempt to escape.
Fifteen minutes we."" allowed in wU-ich
the crew was to abandon her. The
vessel was not armed. The incident oc
curred 110 miles west of Valencia.
Officials admitted that there was a
serious question involved in the Inver
lyon case. They were Inclined to be
lieve that since a boatload of sailors
was reported lost, Americans aboard
could not have been given the "full
measure of safety" which the American
notes demanded. Lansing haa clearly
explained that submarines must not
turn passengers adrift too far from
land and must consider their condition
at sea.
One oBat Is Missing.
Queenstown. April 15. Williuni Ross,
an American sailor from tho bark In
verlyn, reported sunk by submarine gun
fire, is in the hospital here today suf

pedoed in the war zone and grave anx
iety is expressed for other wheat ships

Location Center Street, Bridge
Steel and Estimated Cost
. $198,500
State F.ugineer Lewis today submitted
plans to the Hoard of Viewers for the
inter-county bridge across the Willam
ctto river at this city. The petition of
the joint county courts asked for plans
ior a structure at tho present Center
street site and no other site was con
sidered in the present plans.
The bridge as designed consists of
four 101 foot camel back spans with 138
foot vertical lift span and a reinforced
concrete viaduct approach on the Polk
county end 850 feet in length. The
roadway is 120 feet in width with six
foot walks on either side. The total
cost of tho structure is estimated at
$108,501); $143,100 for the steel struc
ture iucluding foundations, and the re
inforced concrete viaduct approach at
$55,400. Thia provides for a wooden
floor with a two inch asplialtic wearing
surface and if a concrete base six Inches
thick is laid under the " inch nsphnltic
top $4,5o0 should be added to the total
cost, making $1103,000.
In submitting the plans Mr. Lewis
says:
"This type of bridge was selected
for the reason that borings'for founda
tions of piers showed a blue mud and
sand formation jentirely unstated for
concrete nrchesf for the necessary
span, but which was of sufficient bear
ing power to support a steel structure
on concrete piers carried .by w ood pile
foundations. .
Our investigations have led us to bo
lieve that this structure can be com
pleted by December I, UM0, if there is
no delay in letting the contracts. It
should lie understood that, this estimate
has been mnde during a rising ninrkct
for materials, especially steel, which has
been advancing in price. Nevertheless,
it is our opinion that the relative small
tonnage involved iu this bridge can be
obtained without any undue delay and
that the market is already becoming
more stable in price.
"I enn assure you that L. W. Metz
ger, who has been largely responsible
for the details of this design, Joseph
Wenre, who has assisted on the specifi
cations nnd cenernl studies, and the
other experts of this department who
have participated in the work, will be
glad to render you any assistance wnu
in thnir power."
A Low Level Bridge.
The bridire as planned bv the state
highway department is a low level
bridge nnd in general outline greatly
resembles the railroad bridge on Union
street. The board of viewers stute in
their communication submitting tho
plans to the county courts that they
have consulted government engineers as
to the other locations for a bridge on
Marion street, Chcmcketn street and on
Court street. On all of these sites the
government engineers would recquiro
that the proposed plans be submitted to
them before thev were aeepted. As to
Marion street the government engineers
would not consider this plan as it is so
close to the railroad bridge that, it
would be a hindrance to navigation on
the 'river.
The viewers also recommended ngainst
a concrete bridge and stated that they
had made borings on the other streets
and that they had found the river bed
too unstable' to support a heavy con
crete structure and accordingly no
plans for a concrete bridge had been
ordered prepared.
The bonnl of viewers which met with
the county court this afternoon was
giving the matter serious consideration
and will probably take the matter un
der advisement for a few days before
rendering a final decision in the mat
ter. Seaton and Fisher; Schneider and
