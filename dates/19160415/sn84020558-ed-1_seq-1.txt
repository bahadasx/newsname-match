this, and that relief may he looked
tor. involving measures that will in

was the substance of a retiort made
the Main Line committee hy its
counsel. Judge Richard F.. Sloan, hist
night.
There was an enthusiastic meet
ing of the suliscrihers to the Main
Line committee funds at the Cham
lier of Commerce last night. Dr.
Dennett, chairman of the committee,
outlined the organization of this citi
zens' committee by the mass meet
ing held July "3rd last year. He
stated that it had lieen the purpose
of the committee to work along
every line offering any prospect of
securing a main line of railroad. W ith
this end in view a suh-committee of
which J. C. Adams was chairman
was appointed to meet James S.
Douglas and his associates to de
termine what Phoenix could do io
aid the prompt construction of the
proposed Phoenix, Tucson and Tide-
water road: and another sub-committee
with H. A. Fowler as chairman
was appointed to investigate the ex
isting railroad situation in the Pox
I'anynn of the Gila, beyond Winkel
tnan. In addition to the work of
these committees, the general com
mittee has taken up the possibility
of the extension of the San Diego
and Arizona road now being con
structed to the Imperial Valley. Mr.
Adams, for his committee, reported
several interviews with Mr. Douglas
and expressed a hope that with the
improved general financial
more active interest in the
might result. Mr. Adams
a quiet but effective worl-
condition
situation
spoke of
of the
general committee and expressed the
belief that the construction of a main
line road was much nearer than is
generally understood.
Membership of Committee
The committee is composed of Dr.
John Dennett, Jr., J. C. Adams, Dr.
J. C. Norton, Ft. M. Goldwatcr. Dr.

Judge Sloan's Statement
Judge Richard K. Sloan, who has
been retained as counsel by the Main
Dine committee, presented a very
complete report. He stated that at
the request of the committee he had
investigated the validity of the con
tract entered into on December 7,
PlOti, between the Southern Pacific
company and the A T. & S. I'. R. R.
Co., relating to the purchase by the
former of the Phoenix and Kastern
railroad, with the view of ascertain
ing what relief, if any. might be had
under the Sherman act.
He reported that in his opinion
the contract was one in restraint of
trade, and that its purpose and ef
fect were to suppress competition and
that the Sherman act was violated In
two respects:
First: That the contract was one
in restraint of trade and commerce
within the territory of Arizona.
Second: That it was one in re
straint of trade as respects inter
state commerce.
tie further reported that the facts
surrounding the making of the con
tract shows that the purpose of the
contract was to .parcel out the terri
tory between the two railroad sys
terns, the S. I', company to control
all the territory Iving south and east
of Phoenix and the Santa Fe to con
trol the territory lying north of
Phoenix, that these facts were fully
developed in the suit brought by the
I'nited States against the S. P. com
pany, the A., T. & S. 1. Co. et al.
known as the I'nion Pacific Merger
case, but in which no relief was
granted against the contract in ques
tion. for the reason that it was not
within the issues as presented by the
pleadings.
Judge Sloan stated that by the
authority of the committee a letter
was drafted presenting the facts and
sent to the attorney general of the
I'nited States early in September,
1915. This letter requested that the
department of Justice investigate the
case to take action looking to a re
lief from the provision of the con
tract. The Arizona corporation com
mission joined in this request. The
committee directed Judge Sloan and
Judge Lewis T. Carpenter to present
the matter to the department of Jus
tice and a hearing was held at
Washington on September 7, 1!U5
at which Judge Sloan and Chairman
F. A Jones, of the Arizona corpora
tion commission, appeared and pre
sented the case.
Following the interview vvi;h the
attorney general briefs were filed cov

Fxeept for the artillery wings of the There w ere repeated indications to -contending

in France and Belgium.
Several days have now' elapsed since
the Germans launched a heavy attack
on the positions in dispute before Ver
dun, but their artillery has continued
rously to shell the l.e Mort Homme
sector northwest of Verdun ami the
second line positions of the French to
the east of the Meuse.
The French in the former sector are
till answering with their big guns the
ernian fire and evidently are holding
themselves in readiness in anticipation
f the infantry attack that usually suc
ceeds preparatory bombardments.
In the Argonne the French continue
to operate the

points of vantage and in the region of1
lont-A-Moussoti they have shelled
conveys of Germans.

According to the Rome official com

the important crest of Lobbiaalta from
the Austrians and consolidated tile po

The Russians report further successes
gainst the Turks around Krzerum
where the Turks, having been on the
offensive for six days, were repulsed
with heavy losses and are falling back

come through concerning the defeat of
the Turks by the biritish forces in
Mesopotamia where the Turks were
dirven back along the Tigris distances
varying from one and a half to three
miles. London regards this victory as
step -forward to the "relief of the be-
seiged British forces at Kut-F.l-Amara.

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON. April 14 President
Wilson and the cabinet went over the
submarine crisis again today and re
affirmed their determination to bring
the situation with Germany to an
issue.
The decision to inform Germany
that recent accumulation of evidence
'of ships destroyed in submarine war-
faie leads to the inevitable conclusion
'hat her promises to the I'nited
States are not being fulfilled, re
mained uncharged. The time of dis
patching a communication to Berlin
appealed or be tne only point unde
cided. In congress today a report was
widely circulated that the forthcom
ing note would in itself give notice
of a severence of diplomatic rela
tions. There was nothing to sub
stantiate the story any where in of
ficial quarters. Cabinet oflicers did
not deny it. upon the ground thftt
Mhev all had been bound in honor by
without anything in th
nature of an
ultimatum and still would leave the
way open for Germany to avoid the
long feared break in diplomatic rela
tions. It was plain, however, that it
Aouid he intended as the American
government's lust word.
Senators of the foreign relations
committee who have been told by the
president that they would be con
sulted before .".ny definate or drastic
steps were taken declared tonight that
they had not yrt been advised of tic
details of the next step. Chairman
Stone conferred with Secretary reali

there was nothing new in the situa

renewed evidence that the t'nited

the Sussex.

regarded as the capstone of the Amer
ican case if one seemed necessary.

This was the situation as officially

Unarmed Troopers Buying Food

SAN ANTONIO, Texas. April 14.
The Americans whom the Mexicans at
Parral fired on were unarmed, accord
ing to an unconfirmed version of the
incident current in Chihuahua and
transmitted to General Funston today.
According to this story, forty of the
troopers entered Parral, presumably to
purchase supplies, and were fired
upon. Two were killed, and the re
mainder retreated lo the main body of
troops encamped outside the city.
The attacking force pursued the men

killing forty Mexicans.
According to this story, the altack

nd civilians.
This version of the Parral incident
was sent irom l liihuaiiua to iienerat
Bell at 101 Paso, who forwarded il tc
General P'unston. Fu:l allowance was
given by departmental officers to Con
sul Letcher's qualifying words, "un
confirmed version that was current" in
Chihuahua, but there was manifested a
disposition to credit the report.
Many of the officers at headquarters
have regarded the story as more proli
cide than some of the versions that
have come out of Mer.-m. It was
pointed out that in previous cases sol
diers had entered towns for the pur
pose of buying supvlies) and had been
received in a friendly manner by the
residents, and that if they bad gone
into Puiaal for that purpose, it was
probable that they went unarmed.
