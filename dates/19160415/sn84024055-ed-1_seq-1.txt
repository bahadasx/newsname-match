COL. FRANK O. LOWDEN WHEELS IN LINE FOR THE REPUBLICAN
NOMINATION FOR GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS. -
Tuesday, April 11, 1916, will long be
remembered by many of the most
powerful as well as by the gutter snipe
or the small fry politicians in this city,
tie iSlate of Illinois and throughout
the United States for all in all it was
a day in which many of them , -went
low n to their everlasting political defeat
ami many new ones sprang into their
places, -who -will for a very brief period
successfully ride on the political wave
ami then they will be forced aside to
make room for others "who "will occu
py the high places of honor and thus
the world moves or runs on regardless
of the likes or the dislikes of the poli
ticians. It was indeed, very astonishing or
surprising to all the politicians and
would-be statesmen in this city and
throughout the State of Illinois, -when
the returns began to roll in Tuesday
evening and early Wednesday morn
ing to learn that -with the aid of The
Bro..d Ax, the Hon. John M. Harlan
outran Mayor "William Hale Thompson
in this city and county and came "with
in an ace of putting him out of the
running in the State of Illinois for
delegate at large to the Republican
National Convention.
Th's is indeed very remarkable "when
wo take into consideration the fact
that one short year ago tho Hon. Wil
liam Hale Thompson "was elected Mayor
Of fllic nift- Tvfli n-nn Tmnilm flTlfl '
fort -seven thousand majority at his
hacl -that more than ono hundred
thousand milk and "water Democrats,
composing the bread and. butter bri
gade of former Mayor Carter H. Harri
son, greatly assisted to boost Mayor
Thompson into tho City Hall and it
ttust be perfectly evident even to those
ho arc unable to run and read the
s5Es of tho times; that Mayor Thomp
son, is not near as popular now as he
as one short year ago.
There is only ono "way left open for
Mayor Thompson to regain tho full con
fidence of those -who freely voted for
one year ago and. of those who
fi"ea to vote for him ana that is to
let tho politicians alone, refrain from
attempting to buiia up or construct a
Phonal political machine and make an
lonest effort to earn tho eighteen thou
aal dollars a year salary which the
Payers of this city are paying him
to transact their public business for
them.
Notwithstanding the fact that the
Hon. Charles S. Dcneen fell on tho out
side of his political breastworks in the
31st Ward his home ward the De-neen-West-Brundage
combination will
still control tho county committee,
which will place them in a position to
name the county ticket this fall for
they elected ward committeemen in 20
wards leaving Mayor Thompson fifteen
wards, tho Dencen-West-Brundage com
bination will also still be in absolute
control of tho Republican machine
throughout the State of Illinois. Hon.
Roger C. Sullivan and those belonging
to his wing of the Democratic party
routed or put to flight former Mayor
Carter H. Harrison and his followers
who supported tho Hon. William Halo
Thompson for Mayor in 1915 and Mr.
Sullivan will still be head or tho high
chief of tho Democratic party in this
city and in the State of Illinois.
Robert E. Burke, Robert M. Sweit
zer, Hon. Michael Zimmer, Hon. Roger
C. Sullivan will head the delegates at
large to the Democratic National Con
vention. The indications aro that the Hon.
William H. Weber will bo the choice
of tho Dencen-West-Brundage combina
tion for chairman of tho new Republi
can committee of Cook county and if
he is selected for that position he will
more than bo tho right man in the
right place.
Hon. Isaac Newton Powell after a
red hot scrap easily won out for Ward
Committeeman of tho Seventh Ward,
and Robert R. Levy followed suit in
the Third Ward.
Tho four or five little dark clouds
which hovered over or around Hons.
Martin B. Madden and George F. Har
ding for tho past six weeks all faded
away and completely disappeared from
the faintest view on Tuesday, April 11,
and they were both elected delegates
to the Republican National Convention
without any trouble on their hands from
the First Congressional District of Illi
nois and at the same time Congressman
Madden was re-elected committeeman
of the Second Ward.
The big politicians throughout the
state are just beginning to wake up
now, the Presidential primaries are
over and State Senator Richard J. Barr
of Joliet who is very popular in his
home town and in all parts of this
state has become an activo candidate
for the Republican nomination for Attorney-General
of Illinois and he ex
pects to be in the running until the.
state-wide primary day September
13, and Senator Barr, feels that tho
gods are more than favorable to his
nomination and election.
Col. Frank O. Lowden wheels in lino
for the Republican nomination for
Governor of Illinois and from now until
tho September primaries he will use all
honorable methods to secure the nomi
nation. See his announcement in an
other column of this paper.

THE REV. HONORABLE ARCHI
BALD JAMES CAREY, PH. D. D. D.
SHOULD NOT BE ELECTED ONE
OF THE BISHOPS OF THE A. M.
E. CHURCH.
Tho Twin City Star which is pub
lished in St. Paul, Minn., and several
other newspapers which aro published
in tho interest of tho Colored race
throughout the country, are wastincr
their ink and whito paper in puffing
or boosting tho Rev. Hon. Archibald
James Carey, Ph. D. D. D. up for
Bishop of the A. M. E. Church; the
conference meeting in Philadelphia,
Pa., early this coming May.
It will be recalled that tho Rev. Hon.
Archibald James Carey, Ph. D. D. D.
was a candidate for Bishop at tho an
nual conference held in Kansas City,
Mo., in 1912; that the great majority
of the delegates attending that con
ference solidly voted against him for
Bishop for they did not feel that he
was tho right man for that position
and as he is moro of a. ranting rattled
brain politician than a safe, sound and
sane preacher, ho should again bo de
feated in his efforts to become one of
the Bishops at the Philadelphia conference.

campaign, but it will bo a fair cam
paign and free from personal abuse.
Tho voters aro entitled to know my
views upon questions pertaining to the
administration of tho stato government,
and I shall, from time, to time, present
and discuss my views upon theso ques
tions in my public speeches and in pub
lic statements.
"W. H. Stead, of Ottawa, former
Attorney General, will havo tho

time to hold the affair, for many of
the politicians and orators had to re
tire early that evening and hustle out
of bed early Tuesday morning in order
to be able to take part in the State
wide presidential primaries; so it was
impossible for them to be present and

friends occupied seats around the ban
quet table.
