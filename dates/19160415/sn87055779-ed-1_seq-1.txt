AWAIT PERSHING REPORT
ON PARRAL FIGHTING
Anti-American Feeling Runs
High in District Occupied
by Advanced Guard
of U .S. Army.
International New Seri. e :
WASHINGTON. April 10 A num
ber of dispatches dealing with th
general situation confronting the
American expedition in Mexico
reached the war department darin..'
the night, hut their contents wer
withheld. It is understood they con
firm the report that Carranzista sol
diers parti lpaled In the attack upon
American troops at Parral.
Hec'y Baker conferred with Pre't
Wllso:. for half an hour Just before
midnight. It U understood the eu
gestion that the field bnse of the
Pershing punitive expedition he
moved was diuised, bht the secre
tary refused to say -whether action
had been acreed upon.
"There is no change in the situa
tion anywhere," was the only com
ment he would make.
Itcports Arc lHpilctirLg.
All reports reaching Washington
today were far from bring as assur
ing as the secretary's statement.
While war department otfieial ex-
T rw-P,i thA utmost confidence in th
ability of the American column to
protect Itself, it was realized that
Gen. Pershing's troops as evidenced
by the Parral attack, are in a terri
tory, where anti-American feeling
runs high. Not only are ohVials con
vinced that the f'arr.niia forces will
not give any a?itanoo to date they
have rendered none whatever hut
they fear they will 1 -et raj- the Amer
icans altogether by crafty intrigue..
In official circles Gen. Pershing's
own account of the Parral f'irht was
keenly awaited.
State department o!!; ials express
ed no surprise at reports that Gen.
Ramon Iturbide has been sent by
Carranza on a recret mission to
Japan. The negotiations between
Mexico City and Tokio ever sine
the abdication of Porf.rio Diaz have
from time to time engaged the e
riou attention of officials here. Al-
r-plte tho fact that these negotiations
r'.aunt the Monroe doctrine, they
always command the s rious Atten
tion of the Washington government
whenever Mexico Ujty assumes a
uef.ant
attitude toward the Unite,"
