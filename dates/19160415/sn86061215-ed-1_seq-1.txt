The bandits seemed to think the cut
ting off of the rear truck would be
easy because some of them got within
a few feet of it before the Americans,
who were withholding their fire, start
ed shooting.
The American soldiers thought they
hit some of the bandits.
At the constitutionalist camp within
a few miles of the scene of the fight
ing it was reported that three bandits
were killed during the first part of
the week. Lieut. A. R. Christie of the
aero squad commanded the men in
the fight. The fight was over too
quickly for the men in the forward
trucks to get into action.
ANXIOUS ABOUT FORCE.
Washington, D. C., April 14. —Deep
anxiety was felt in official circles to
day over the fate of Major Tompkins
and his little force of U. S. cavalry, at
tacked In Parral, Mexico, on Wednes
day.
Known to be outnumbered, perhaps
beleagured, in a district notoriously
anti-American, it was feared that the
troopers might be in grave danger.
Lack of information from the isolated
detachment intensified the anxiety for
their safety. Wireless, field telegraph
and every other available means of
communication have been employed to
get to Gen. Pershing the instructions
to rush to headquarters with all pos
sible speed a report on the incident
and the measures he has taken to re
lieve the little cavalry force that was
forced to fight for its life Wednesday
night.
"Unbroken silence on those subjects
was not taken at headquarters, how
ever, to mean that Gen. Pershing was
unaware of the fight or that he was
not doing anything to assist the de
tached and menaced cavalrymen. Gen.
Funston and his staff officers realized
that Gen. Pershing must first receive
from Parral the story of what occur
red and because of his own location,
far to the front, perhaps beyond the
most advanced wireless station, might
have to use couriers in getting the ac
count of the developments of the past
forty-eight hours back to the border.
PRESSING FOR BARRAL REPORT.
Washington, D. C., April 14.—Gen.
Funston today reported to the war
department that he had received no
word from Gen. Pershing on the fight
Wednesday at Parral but that he is
continuing to press for information.
Secretary Baker said today there
had been as yet no change in Gen.
Funston's orders but declined to dis
cuss questions of policy raised by the
Carranza note. The border command
er's hands were entirely free, he said,
to make any necessary disposition of
£he 30,000 men under his command.
Dispatch of troops to strengthen the
supporting lines or the shifting of bor
der forces to places best adapted to
eventualities are matters of which
Gen. Funston himself is the only
judge.

The fight which occurred about 9
o'clock last night was several miles
in the rear of the automobiles carry

twenty minutes. When the bandits
who tried to capture one truck came
up, the Americans poured in five vol

There were two attacks, the first a
slight one, and directed against a for

NINETEEN THOUSAND AMERICAN
SOLDIERS GUARDING BORDER
AGAINST SURPRISE.
El Paso, Tex., April 14.—More than
19,000 U. S. regulars are guarding the
Mexican border from Brownsville,
Tex., to San Diego, Cal., today, •while
hurried troop movements southward
from Columbus, N. M., show that the
line of communications reaching over
400 miles Into Mexico to the advance
guard of Gen. Pershing's expedition
ary force, is being rapidly strength
ened to meet any emergency. Ameri
can scouts are watching the Pulpito
pass which leads from Sonora into the
Casas Grandes district of Chihuahua
state, for the appearance of Gen. Ar
nulfo Gomez, commanding a body of
2,500 Carransa Infantry and cavalry.
Gen. Gomez is awaiting orders from
the Mexican minister of war, Gen.
Obregon, to go into Chihuahua for the
announced purpose of taking up the
pursuit of Villa. In the event of
trouble with the de facto government
Gen.^ Gomez would he in position to
strike the line of American communi
cations at Casas Grandes.
An aeroplane has joined In the
scouting operations undertaken to as
Hawiah'm Arty] a
At the same time the anti-American
agitators who have been busy for
weeks spreading stories of the United
States' lnttentlon to embark on a war
of conquest have not overlooked their
opportunity. Their first effort was
the spreading of a story in Juarez to
the effect that hundreds of people had
been slain In an attack upon Parral
by American soldiers and that the
"Gringoes" had been defeated with
great losses. Gen. Gavira, the Car
ranza commander, took speedy steps
to crush this yarn by posting in a
prominent place Gen. Obregon's of
ficial account of the Parral incident
which was read by thousands yester
day and last evening. The people ac
cepted the official version and what
little excltment had been created
quickly subsided.
The authorities here were so well
satisfied that there was no occasion
for alarm that nothing beyond the
normal precautions were taken to
guard the town during the night. To
day rumors of impending riots and rev
olutions have given way to the in
tense interest with which the develop
ments in the diplomatic situation at
Washington are awaited. Even the
popular amusement of locating Villa
has lost its charm pending the result
of President Wilson's deliberation
with his cabinet.
HUNTING THEJIGHER UPS
Agents of U. S. Department of Justice
Wants to Get Men Who Directed
Bomb Plots.
New York, April 14.—Agents of the
department of justice and federal
prosecutors who already have eight
men under arrest on charges of at
tempting to blow up munitions ships
with fire bombs still sought today the
principals who originated, financed
and directed the alleged conspiracy.
They declared that the eight prisoners,
mainly employes of the North German
Lloyd and Hamburg-American steam
ship companies, were active only in
the execution of the plot, the manufac
ture and distribution of the bombs by
which it is charged fires were started
on more than thirty steamers. The
identity of the chief conspirators, if
known to the authorities, has not
been disclosed.
One man for whom the federal
agents are searching- is Walter T.
Scheele, head of the New Jersey Agri
culture & Chemical Co., of Hoboken, in
whose factory the fire bombs are said
to have been charged with explosive
chemicals.

in New Controversy
DEMAND TO BE MADE
FOR SHOW OF FAITH
Evidence at Hand Indicates
German Violations of
Her Agreements
Washfngton, D. C., April 14.—It was
indicated today that the next step in
the submarine crisis, probably the
sending to Germany of the cumulative
evidence which the United States con
tends shows violations of Berlin's as
surances, will be taken within the
next forty-eight hours. Developments
are expected to follow rapidly.
The evidence collected by Secretary
Lansing was placed before the cabinet
today. Affidavits on the Sussex case,
which arrived on the steamer St. Paul
were not before the cabinet but it was
said that the evidence was so com
plete that they were not entirely
necessary to the preparation of the
case of the United States:
The president and the cabinet show
ed no disposition to let the Mexican
situation postpone action on the sub
marine question.
The administration considers the
German note possibly shows that a
submarine attacked the Sussex.
The president and the cabinet are
understood to have agreed that the
presentation of the facts shall be ac
companied hy a definite and final de
mand for evidence of Germany's' good
faith and observance of her guaran
tees but probably will bp accompanied
by no time limit which properly could
be described as an ultimatum.
EVIDENCE ARRIVE8.
New York, April 14.—Guarded by
Sir Charles Allom of the British for
eign office, the evidence in the Sussex
case which has been gathered for
the American state department ar
rived here on the American steamship
St. Paul. It included affidavits of the
survivors and was part of an excep
tionally large amount of embassy
mail, filling twenty big sacks. The af
fidavits are those gathered by at
taches of the American embassies in
Paris and London.
"Among the St. Paul's 586 passen
gers was Edward H. Huxley of Engle
wood, N. J., president of the United
States Rubber Export Co. of this city,
who was a passenger on the Sussex,
escaping uninjured. Mr. Huxley,^af
ter confirming previously cabled news
dispatches regarding the attack on
the vessel, stated positively that from
the hour that the vessel left the Brit
ish shore until the moment that she
was attacked and for nine hours there
after, not another vessel was sighted
except the destroyer which came to
the rescue.
Mr. Huxley made this assertion in
connection with the text of Germany's
note of April 10 to the state depart
ment citing an attack by a German
submarine on an unarmed vessel in
the vicinity of the Sussex at the? hour
iwhen the latter met with mishap.
Mr. Huxley also said he was postive
the Sussex carried ho ammunition.
The German note declared that a
"violent explosion" on the ship which
was torpedoed warranted "the certain
conclusion that great amounts of mu
nitions were aboard."
Mr. Huxley said a warrant officer
who had talked with the captain of
the Sussex declared that the captain
had said he had seen the wake of a
torpedo.
Mr. Huxley showed a letter which
he said had been written by Capt.
Thomas Carroll, French embarkation
officer at Boulogne, France, in which
Capt. Carroll said:
"I have just helped take from the
Sussex 'the body of a woman with a
piece of German torpedo imbedded
in her stomach."
It was understood that Mr. Huxley
planned to visit Washington to con
fer with state department officials re
garding the Sussex.
FRENCH GIVE FACT8.
Paris, April 14.—The American gov
ernment is now in possession of the
information obtained by the French
government which led to the assertion
that the steamship Sussex was torpe
doed by a German submarine. Full
details, even to the name of the com
mander and number of the subma
rine, have been communicated pri
vately to the American government.-
This information is not made pub
lie because it is the desire of French
officials to give Germany an oppor
tunity to reply to the statement that
the name of the commander and
num.
ber of the submarine are known.

LOWER RITES ON
OCEAN FREIGHT
EFFORTS BEING MADE BY THE
GOVERNMENT TO CUT DOWN
COST OF 8HIPPING.
London, April
3.—(Correspondence
of The Associated Press)—Govern
ment action in the matter of reducing
freight rates is apparent in most di
rections of the market and fears are
entertained by those who at present
are reaping a harvest fn the sections
hitherto untouched by government
measures that their turn will soon
come for a scaling downwards in quo
tations.
These lower rates apply only to
British steamers as the authorities
have no control ofver neutral tonnage
but some move Is contemplated in
order to bring neutrals into line by
restricting insurance and bunkering
facilities.
The requisitioning of German steam
ers by Portugal has already relieved
the' scarcity of tonnage somewhat and
several of these boats are on voyage
for the allies with much needed pit
props.
Certain sections of the shipping
world are optimistic regarding the
Dardanelles being free for Russian
shipments before the end of the year
and discuss the possibility of laden
steamers leaving Black sea ports for
the Mediterranean and United King
dom in August. No cargoes of grain
have as yet been sold for shipment
from that direction but It Is consider
ed significant that some of the big
gest merchants on the Baltic are offer
ing stocks of American, Australian
and Argentine cereals rather freely.

in Starting Movement
Here This Spring
Interest in the big clean up meeting
to be held Monday evening in the
rooms of the Commercial club is grow
ing and all over the city a sentiment
for the cleaner and prettier Ottumwa
Is cropping out. The attendance at
the first mass meeting planned to fur
ther the movement this year is ex
pected to be large for many people of
both sexes and In all parts of the city
are interested in the work.
The committee of twenty-one that
did such effective work last year is
Just as active this spring and even
more keen to do than a year ago. The
members of this committee and all
who participated In the organization
effected by the clean up boosters last
year feel that the experience of the
first year has been a help and should
make it easier now to accomplish the
ends for which the movement was
started.
Despite the fact that a full attend
ance of the committee was not pres
ent at the meeting held April 6, the
Interest was not In the least dimin
ished. Many were unable»for various
reasons to be present at the first
meeting but all are expected at the
mass meeting Monday evening. The
fact that the governor's proclamation
sets Monday, April 24, as the official
opening day of the clean up period,
it is expected to have things moving
in good shape here by that time.
Want Permanence.
Organization will be accomplished
and the workers busy by the date of
the opening of official clean up week.
The expectation here, however, with
many of the clean up boosters, is to
make it not a week but a continuous
clean up. Permanence is the idea that
many of the workers in Ottumwa be
lieve# in and the meeting next Mon
day 'will see considerable sentiment
for a permanent movement to clean
up and keep clean.
Competition among people in a
neighborhood will be encouraged and
every section of the city entered in
the contest for which prizes will be
given for the best kept premises. If
the plans of some of the boosters for
cleaner Ottumwa prevail. The per
son taking pride In his or her own
premises will see that the alley and
street on which the home is located
are tidy and in keeping with the
premises.
The meeting of next Monday has
been characterized by one enthusiast
as the gathering of the enemies of
dirt and disease. Cleanliness and
sanitation applied to every home In
the city and to the vacant lots, streets
and alleys, the removal of tin cans,
old papers, rags and other rubbish
from yards, streets, alleys and also
from the cellars, sheds, etc., where
they are hidden away from sight, will
be things discussed at the clean up
meeting. The removal of disease
breeding places and a general better
toning of the city throughout, making
it a nicer and healthier place to live
the encouraging of everyone to clean
up the house, the yard, the barn, shed
or garage, the lawq, parking, alley and
street adjoining, etc., are all things
that the clean up campaign to be
launched in Ottiimwa at the big
meeting Monday night is to accom
plish.
Every man and woman of Ottumwa
is invited to attend the meeting or
at least become interested in the
movement by starting at home in
clean up work. A big attendance
Monday night will make possible a
good start for the work this spring
and a better prospect for the success
ful accomplishment of a cleaner and
brighter Ottumwa this summer.

BATTLE AROUND
VERDUN FAILS TO
CHANGE ASPECTS
LIVELY ENGAGEMENTS OCCUR,
BUT MOST OF FIGHTING 18
WITH THE BIO GUNS.
Paris, April 14.—West of the Meuse
a violent bombardment was delivered
by the Germans against the French
lines to the west of hill 804, says the
French official communication publish
ed this morning. Yesterday evening
to the east of the Meuse a small
attack was made on the French posi
tions south of Douaumont but it was
completely repulsed. There was a
lively bombardment south of Haudre
ment. In the Woevre district artillery
duels took place.
The Germans have made several at
tempts to advance against the Rus
sians in the Lake Narocz region but,
according to Petrograd they have been
repulsed.
On the Austro-Italian line bombard
ments continue and the Turks have
made several powerful attacks on posi
tions taken from them by the Rus
sians In the Caucasus region but their
attempts failed, according to the Rus
sians.
Five more vessels have met disaster
from contact with mines or submar
ines.
A semiofficial dispatch from Berlin
estimates the French losses around
Verdun at 150,000.
BRITONS DEFEAT TURKS.
London, April 14. —Defeat of the
Turkish forces in Mesopotamia hy the
British was reported officially. In an
engagement on the Tigris the Turks
were driven back from one and ono
half to three miles.
The announcement of the British
victory came at a time when the pub
lic was beginning to fear efforts to re
lieve the force of Gen. Townshend at
Kut-El-Amara were doomed to failure,
owing to the check suffered by the re
lieving army a few days ago and the
difficulties brought about by floods.
Many military writers In England
believed the floods had made the re
lief of Gen. Townshend almost an im
possibility but today's official report
shows that, instead of hindering the
British, the high water has helped the
forces of Lieut. Gen. Gorrlnge in one
of the tnost difficult tasks undertaken
by the British army. Each mile the
Turks are forced back makes the Brit
ish operations easier for as they ap
proach Kut-El-Amara the Turks are
compelled to defend a wider front. In
view of today's news, therefore, the
prospect of rescuing the army at Kut
El-Amara is regarded as better than it
has been for some time.
ANOTHER SHIP SUNK.
Queenstown, April 14.—Capt. Char
leston and eleven men of the British
steamship Inverlyon were landed to

been sunk by a submarine on Tuesday
afternoon. One of the members of the
crew who was rescued 1s an American,
William Loss. Another boat from the

San Francisco, April 14.—"I wish

On the official ballot these men ap

that party lasts, "or until there shall
be what every man who follows pass

action upon common ground of the
progressive and republican parties at

"I trust that every forward looking
