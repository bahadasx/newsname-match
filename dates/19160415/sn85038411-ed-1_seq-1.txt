By Associated Vrrst
Washington. 15. C„ April 13.—State
Department dispatches from El Paso
to-day refer to unconfirmed reports of
a second fight with American troops
at Parral.
General Funston td-day telegraphed
the War Department that he had not
heard from General Pershing for
three days. Secretary Baker said that
General Funston was urging General .
Pershing to rush a report on the Par- •'
ral incident.
General Funston's message was .
taken to indicate that the silence of ,
General Pershing probably was due <
to inability to get information rather 1
lhan to interruption of communica
tion. General Funston has been in
communication with other authorities ,
in close touch with the advance expe
dition, but had asked General Per- J
shlng to report oftener if possible to |
keep the War Department advised.
Secretary Baker said he still was ;
waiting for a report on the confer- i
ences between General Pershing and
Generals Herrera and Gutierrez.
Battle Is Imminent
Eliseo Arredondo. General Car- !
ransta's ambassador here, said to-day
he bad no further information of the
fighting at Parral nor of reports of a
later clash and had been advised of ]
no developments in General Car
ranxa's proposal for the withdrawal
of American troops.
Dispatches to the Carranza embassy
said the arrival of the general and his
party in Mexico City was accompanied
by a popular demonstration.
A battle at Cuernavaca, the Zapata ]
stronghold, was reported imminent.
The advance guard of the Carranza
forces was said to be in plain sight of
the fortress.
Situation Unchanged
Secretary Lansing considered the
.Mexican situation unchanged to-day in
any aspect.
Unless official reports to General
Funston disclose a more grave situa
tion at Parral, where American troops
were lired upon, than is now believed
to exist, there was nothing to indicate
that a change might be expected in '
the near future.
Secretary Baker said General Funs
ton had not heard from General Per
shing directly for three days. That
caused no uneasiness at the War De
partment, however, as General Per- i
shing has reported only when he had
definite and important information to
communicate. Reports from other
commanders in the field gave no new
status to the pursuit of Villa and his
bandits.
As time passes without official In
formation on the Parral lighting from
American source, officials are in- ,
dined to doubt that the clash .was as I
serious as described in early Mexican
advices. It was considered unlikely ;
that the American force was in any !
serious plight since the commander
might have sent back messengers to
the nearest supporting column.
Some army officers thought it i
probable that when a report was re
ceived. it would show the detachment i
had passed in or around Parral since '
the disorder and was proceeding about j
its business of pursuing Villa, headed j
