WASHIMTTON, April 15.?State de
partment despatches from El Paso to
day refer to unconfirmed reports of l
second fight with American troops a
Parral.
General Funston today telegraphei
the war department that he had no
beard from General Pershing for threi
days. Secretary Baiter, said that Gen
oral Funston was urging Genera
Pershing to rush a report on the Par
ral Incident.
General Funston's message was tak
en to Indicate that the silence of Gen
eral Pershing probably was due to In
ability to get Information rather thai
to Interruption of communication. Gen
eral Punston has been In communlca
Hon with other authorities In closi
touch with the advaaced expedition bu
had asked General Pershing to repor

est concern for the safety of thi
American line of communication wai
manifested In military quarters heri
today. Every preparation has beei
made at the base here to keep the llni
Intact.
Motor trucks lined up and filled will
rations stood In front of military head
quarters awaiting and the telegrapl
station here was ordered to he kep
open throughout the night.
No reason was offered at militarj

that ^t was based upon reports madi

It Is known that with diplomatic re

Carranza pending close watch Is belnj
made for a trace of the 4,000 men under
General Gomez, who were report
ed to be moving from Sonora Intt
Chihuahua In such a way as to present
possible menace to the Amor!
can line of communication. Howcvei
reports from military sources Indlcati
that the force today could not be located
In northwestern Chihuahua.
From the fact that no word froir
General J. J. Pershing has passet
through here for several days It li
assumed that the expeditionary headquarters
Is beyond communlcatioi
with the American end of the supplj
routes. Numbers of messages pass

PERSHING'S CAMP AT THI

the American troopers call "Villa'i

tured after the Guerrero light, It wai
learned today from men of the Sev
enth. who participated in that battle
The drug store was a nark mni? CroSr,
with quinine capsules, antiseptics anc
bandages. In addition tbe mule car
rled a quantity of coffee which th(
Americans considered of equal lm
portance with drugs.
SITUATION UNCHANGED
IN ANY ASPECT AT ALL
( V A1IOC1ATRD PRUD
WASHINGTON. April 15.?Secretar)
Lansing pronounced the Mexican sit
uatlon unchanged today In any aspect
Unless official reports to Genera
Funs ton dlsclOBe a more grave sttua
tlon at Parral there was nothing t(
Indicate that a change might be ex
pected In the near future.
As times passes without official In
A formation of the Parral fighting fron
American sources, officials are Inclined
to doubt that the clash was ai
serious as described In early Mexlcat
advices. It was considered unllkelj
that the American force was In anj
serious plight since the commandei
might have sent back messengers t(
the nearest supporting columns.
Some army officers thought-It prob
able that when a report was receive!
It would show the detachment hat
passed In or around Parral since thi
disorder and was proceeding abou
Its business of pursuing Villa; headei
for Its original destination beyond tbi
town.
Publication In Mexico City of thi
terms the Carranza government seeki
to Impose limiting any reclproca
troop movement across the Interna
tlonal boundary sheds much light oi
the diplomatic tangle, which precede*
General Carransa's suggestion tha
the American troops be recalled fron

o continue his school work and he
ntered Broaddus College, which was
hen located in the northern section
if this city, and continued his work
