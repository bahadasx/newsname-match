"The people of Grant, a com
paratively small parish, can well
I afford to smile over the bombastic
Sclaims that are made by some of
the folks in the larger parishes
about the taxes they are votinr
Sfor schools and good roads" said
Editor H. G. Goodwin of the Col
fax Chronicle. "Eight years ago"
he continues, "during Governor
Sander's term, Grant Parish vot
-ed a special 5 mill tax for
I building good roads and with
Iin the last two years all the wards
(of the parish have voted either
for bond issues or annther five
.mill tax for five years for the
Isame purpose.
"In the matter of special taxes ,
for schools the parish Is also well
up with the procession. Many of a
school districts have been votingp
special taxes for fifteen or sixteen
y ears. Some of the dstrise at a
this time paying 15 or 0 malls .
taxes for the benefit of their L
school. .
"To'show the .great interest
four people take in . hools we
call attention to the faeet that o
Tuesday of this week nine elec
tions were held and overy one ot f
them were carried by a rooId. b
majority. Dr Prong dstrict, i,[ a
particular, distinguished itself. 0
_In that, distrit the voferscarrie- i

DID lIE LOSE A FRIEND ?
Editor Who Thought ie Had Mistaken,
tre Says Another Editor.
in a little address the other
evening at an informal atfair, the
editorof a big newspaper told how
he lost a friend through an edi
torial comment he had made the
day before. He told them about
h- it simply to show how easy it is
ig to lose friends, as he put it. ,ut
ce the editor was never more mnis
)1- taken in his life than when he
made the statement, for the rea
'- son that you cannot lose a it end.
'd the fellow whose friendshit the
o- oditor believe i he has lost wa1s
dd never a friend; otherwise ho
would not have lost him. Friends
stick by you when you make
mistakes; that's why they are
friends.
Lt What kind of a friend is it who
3 is with you only so long as you
flatter him? What sort of friend
d ship is it that demands the best
always, and will not forgive your
errors? What manner of friend
is he who stands by your side
o only when the sun is shining,
and who runs from y.)u when
the clouds are black and threat
e ening?
- An editor, naturally, has few
e friends, albeit no class of men in
a the world appreciates friends to
a agreaterextent. But dealing as
he does in the bare, plain facts
of the day, applying as he does
I the cold logic of every situation
to all persons under discussion,
and measuring men and measures
with an inanimate yardstick. an
editor naturally displeases many
"people in the course of his com
ments. But he doesn't lose any
friends, if once he has made them
So it doesn't worry an editor in
the least to be informed that he
has "lost a lot of friends." as the
editor under discussion put it in
his remarks the other evening. -
