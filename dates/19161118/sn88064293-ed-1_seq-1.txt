BRILLIANT SOCIAL FEATURE
- GIVEN BV H. U. J. K. CLUB
Anniversary Bair and Banquet Tendered in Celebration
of Year of Social Events.
"I Could Dance Till Day is Dawn
in,,' Then I Want to dance All Morn
in", is the opinion of the fifty-seven
clubmen and guests who spent a per
fect evening (till 2:15 a. m.) in
celebrating with dancing and ban
queting the first anniversary of the
H. U. J. K. Club at the spacious au
ditorium of the City Hall here last
night. The banquet feature of the
social event was h?ld at The Costello
Hotel where Mrs. F. J. Price took
the celebrators in hand and served
them bountifully and well with re
freshments that were both delicious
and substantial. From 9:30 o'clock
until midnight the revelers danced
away the hours, then went
to the Costello where they
were wined and dined and toasted
until they had done justice to the
Excellent offerings, when they re
turned to the scene of the waltz and
one-step until the parting hour at
2:15.
Music for the occasion was fur
nished by the Donaldsonvilli Orches
tra, an eight-piece lk>dy of, artists
who made music divine. The pro
gram of dances confined many
numbers especially entitled for the
gay affair and the dispensation of
favors to certain fortunate fair at
tendants was a novelty innovation
which created great fun. Whirling in
the graceful measure of an entranc
ing waltz or one-step, the musicians
would be suddenly halted and all
couples come to a pause. Scattered
at intervals over the ballroom flour
were numbered slips and the young
lady of the couple who came to rest
on a certain slip, the number of
which was announced by the master
of ceremonies, was presented with
a box of crisp chocolates. These
special prizes were won by Misses
Florence Ditch, Leta Prohaska, Ma
bel George, Rebecca Marques and
Inez Wilson.
At 9:30, the grand march, led. with
grace and charm by Miss Winnie
Smyly and Mr. W. J. Bouterie, was
begun. The lights in the hall were
turned off and in hands of each
couple a sparkler, throwing off a my
riad of tiny flashing sparks, supplied
a beautiful illumination for this
opening number.- Throughout the
evening the resourceful young men
of* the H. U. J. K. Club kept their
guests in a happy and delightful
state with their frequent unique
surprises. The splendid hosts of the
occasion, the beautiful young ladies,
their handsome costumes, the en- ;
chanting music, the banquet, and the
sparkling wit and joy of effervescent
youth and health made the first an
niversary of the organization of the
H. U. J. K. Club a memorable date
in the memory books of the partici
pants.
Among the out-of-town guests for
the Anniversary were Miss May De
