Stoutly Oppose Germany's
Proclaiming of Russian
Poland as Independent
State.
Rome, via Paris, Nov. 18 The
Italian government has Joined the en
tente powers in protesting against the
action of Germany in proclaiming
Russian Poland an independent state.
Premier Paolo Boselli has sent the
following telegram to Premier Stur
meyer of Russia:
"I heartily assert myself with the
communication addressed to you from
Paris, at the close of the allied con
ference by my colleagues, Premiers
Briand and Asquith, with regard to
the pretention of Germany and Austria-Hungary
to create a new state out
of Polish territory which they tempo
rarily occupy. The Italian nation has
always nourished the most sympathet
ic feelings for the Polish people and
we have full confidence that the vic
tory of the allied armies will foil the
illusory plan formed by our enemies
in contempt of the law of nations and
conventions in force. The royal gov
ernment can only rejoice at the dec
larations already made by the Imper
ial government guaranteeing the au
tonomy of the United Polish peoples
which has been the secular ideal of
that noble nation."

FARMERS FORCE I
UP IDOOMLTS
Underestimated Crops in Re
ports to Federal Government
Is Discovered by In
vestigators. New York, Nov. IS. An assertion
that western farmers underestimated
their crops in reports submitted to the
federal government and thereby
forced up the price of wheat, potatoes,
onions and cabbage, is the latest con
tribution to the high cost of food in
vestigation here. The charge is made
by Joseph Hartigan, commissioner of
weights and measures, who has just
returned from a tour of 29 states un
dertaken to determine, the reason for
the high cost of living and incidentally
to complete arrangements for a farm
ers congress to be held hero In Feb
ruary. Mr. Hartigan's investigations con
vinced him, he said, that the govern
ment estimate of wheat crop in this I
country this year was based on statis
tics furnished by the farmers who
"knowingly concealed at least 25 per
cent of their wheat crop" According
to Mr. Hartigan, this surplus has been
held in reserve to be dumped into a
market, supposedly short many mil
lions of bushels, at a price otherwise
1 unobtainable.
"I do not charge the farmers with
being out and out dishonest," declared
Mr. Hartigan, "but tho least that can
be said of them is that their action
was unpatriotic. They aro doing tho
same thing In many parts of tho coun
try in regard to potatoes, cabbages and
onions. 1 have not the slightest doubt
that if these reserve supplies were re
leased we would hcar considerably
less about crop shortages and the cost
of these farm products would be re
duced to the retail purchaser at least
25 per cent from the prices now pre
vailing." nn

COAL ADVANCES 25 CENTS
AND WILL MAKE BIGGER
JUMP MONDAY MORNING
In the midst of their reflections on
the high cost of living, the Ogden and
.Salt Lake public were Jarred this
morning by a Jump of 25 cents a ton
in the price of coal, and this was mere
ly a premonitory warning of a real
jumbo-Jump, next Monday morning, of
$1 a ton In addition.
Those who have laid in their wintor
supply at the comparatively low price
of $5.75 are singing today: "Old King
Coal Is a merry old soul, but a tough
old soul is he."
Inquiry among the dealers elicited
the fact that all of them received a
"notification from the mines" this
morning that coal is humping Itself
for a phenomenal jump of $1 a ton
Monday morning and all orders are be
ing taken subject to that condition.
H. M. Taylor, president of the Cen
tral Coal and Coke company, operat
ing mines in seven states, was in Salt
Lake yesterday and the big jump was
announced on the occasion of the mag
nate's visit. He was interviewed as to
the cause.
"Shortage of cars," he said, "failure
of railroads to keep up their equip
ment for Interstate trade; hundreds of
cars standing idle because the law
won't permit their use (because of de
fects) ; roads in mining districts in
financial difficulties, allowing rolling
stock to go down."
C. S. Martin, a leading coal man of
Salt Lake, said the "famine" was par-
PEACE MOVE IS
TAKG SHAPE
Will Be Joint Call From Vari
ous Neutrals Asking Bel
ligerents to Join Con -ference.
Berlin, Nov. 18, via London, 10:45
a. m. The movement for peace nego
tiations, according to reports from
"tho Swiss frontier," which were
printed by the Koemische Zeilung, is
about to assume definite shape in the
form of if joint call from various neu
tral governments to the belligerents
asking them to send delegates to a
peace conference. The reports assert
that several European neutrals aro al
ready in touch with tho American gov
ernment and that various belligerents
have been sounded on the proposition
of a conference.
According to this story, the confer
ence would, necessarily open Its sit-
tially due to the scarcity of labor, that
the Utah mines are operatnlg with
about a 60 per cent force.
The retail dealers are not blamable
for the raise. The producers are do
ing It, "at the mine." They all say it
is due to car shortage.
There's a ray of hope, however.
While the Ogden dealers all roport
lack of supply and Imminent increase
in price, they may be able, like the
Utah Fuel company of Salt Lake, to
obtain supplies at the rates which
have been charged. A. D. PlerBon,
sales manager of the Utah Fuel com
pany, has made the following stato
ment: "While the coal situation is acute,
It is not panicky by any means. The
Utah Fuel company will continue to
sell coal at the same price it Is charg
ing now at the mines and supply as
much of the demand in Salt Lake as
possible. 1 see no apparent prospect
of the Utah Fuel company raising the
price of coal to the retail dealers."
The mine operators aro also excus
ing the raise by stating that the price
has increased from $1 to $3 in all parts
of tho country except Utah.
The car shortage is reported to be
causing widespread distress.
Few orders for coal can now be
filled In Ogden. A few cars will ar
rivo Monday, it Is said. All of the deal
ers are pleading for the delivery of
their orders.
tings without an armistice being pro
claimed, interruption of hostilities
coming only after it was established
that the negotiations were apt to be
crowned with success.
In authoritative circles hore it is
slated that no facts aro known upon
which the Koelnlsche Zeltung's story
could bo based, while it is considered
not impossible that neutral govern
ments may be considering some such
step.

by the International Institute of Ag

all nations are confronted with a grave I
situation. I
It is estimated that at least 2,300,- '
000,000 bushels of wheat will be con- j
sumed in the year ending July 81, -1917,
and that at the end of this pe- ;
riod the world's surplus supplies o j ,
wheat will have decreased to 46,000,- j !
000 bushels. The report says it is j
only on account of tho fact that last ;
year's harvests were abundant, leav- f
ing a balance of 350,000,000 bushels j
that there is available sufficient wheat , jH
for the year ending with next July.
The world's surplus of five cereals ,
wheat, rye, barley, oats and corn j
is placed at 533,000,000 bushels. This t lfl
includes the unexpectable Russian
stocks and also the stocks of Ruma
nia and Bulgaria. The surplus of oats :
is placed at 166,000,000 bushels. A ' '
general scarcity of fodder is expected. I
The total Russian stocks of wheat j

tions permitted, would be available
for report at the next harvest are es
