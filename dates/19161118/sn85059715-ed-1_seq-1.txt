NEW YORK, Nov. 18.?An assertion.
that western farmers under-estimated
their crops In reports submitted
to the federal government and i
thereby forced up the price of wheat, 1
potatoes, onions and cabbage, Is the
latest contribution to the high cost;
of food investigation here. The charge
is made by Joseph Hartigan, coramis- j
sioner of weights and measures, who .
has jusrt returned from a tour of |
twenty-nine states undertaken to de- !
termine the reason for the high cost j
of living and incidentally to com- ;
piete arrangements for the farmers' 1
congress to be held here in Febru- '
ary. '
Mr. Hartigan's Investigation convinced
him, he said, that the govern- *
ment estimate of the wheat crop in
this country this year was based on 1
statistics furnished by the farmers J
who "knowingly concealed at least '
twenty-five per cent of their wheat j
crop." According to Mr. Hartigan
this surplus has been held in reserve
to be clumped Into a market, supposedly
short many millions of bushels
at a price otherwise unobtainable.
"I do not charge the farmers with
being out and out dishonest," declared
Mr. Hartigan, "but the least
that can be said of them is that their
action was unpatriotic. They are doing
the same thing in many parts of
the country in regard to potatoes,
cv.hbages and onions. I have not the
slightest doubt that if these reserve
supplies were released we would
. hear considerable less about crop
shortages and the cost of these farm
products would be reduced to the retail
purchaser at least twenty-five per i
cent from the prices now prevailing."
The high prices now demanded for (
tne necessaries is being recognized by <
large employers and measures have!*
been adopvted to ameliorate the sit-1
uation. The Brooklyn Truck Company,
with the apprbval of..its board
of directors, announced today a substantial
bonus for each of Its ninety
employes. Accompanying each check
was a note explaining that the money i
had been voted "to relieve the strain
among employes on account of the
high cost of living."
Announcement was also made that
the Underwood Typewriter Company
planned to distribute $250,000 among
its employes in the middle of the winter
when the cost of living is usually
the highest.
Food speculators last week made a
profit of more tha $900,000 on a single
item of eggs, according to state
food experts. This week's toll from
the city householders, they say, will
exceed $1,000,000. -

Although, he Is now chief of police ski
of the city, having been selected at '
Friday night's meeting of the city figl
council, Nicholas M. Whyte will con- ma
tinue to wear for several-, days the los
lieutenant's suit and cap, as he has Mo
for the last seven yearB.
If Mr. Whyte was about ieight tons Qf
heavier he might be able to wear former
Ghlef Brooks's uniform .without
attraetine attention on the street.
Harry L. Brooks's resignation as
chief was accepted hy the city council
and that body voted unanimously for .a
Lieutenant Whyte-as the new chief.c r?f'
The appointment of Mr. Whyte is a
deserved recognition - of his faithful
services as an officer in the last fifteen taS
years. For eight years he was a patrolman,
and since 1909 he has been aei
lieutenant, having charge of . the - department
at night. There is no douSt p|
that the appointment will-meet with
the hearty approval of an overwhelming
majority of the people of the

Shortly after he tendered his reslg- ^
nation as chief, Harry X. Brooks paid
a high tribute to Lieutenant Whyte, 1
saying that'lie was "one of the best
officers ! have ever known." ?
