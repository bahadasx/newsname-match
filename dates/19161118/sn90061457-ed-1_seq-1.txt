THE REPUBLIC
REPUTATION
Was Willing to Sell
Republicans
Defeat
'Caused State Chairman James Cowgill
to Blush with Shame and
Repudiate Its Acts
It is all well and proper that inde
pendent papers should accept political
advertising from all parties for pay,
but when papers which have been
the organs of the Democratic or Re
publican parties for years stoop so
low in the scale of political harlotry
and prostitution to accept money and
open their columns for the opposite
party, they . should as they do lose
the respect and confidence of the mem
bers of their party and sink to the
depths of the streets and alleys
prostitute. The St. Louis Republic in
the campaign closed on Nov. 7 caused
every Democrat in the state to blush.
If the Kansas City Star was not al
ready a political harlot (although It
supports Democracy between elections
and the Republican ticket at elections)
it would also have caused the flush
to come to the cheek of every decent
citizen and the Kansas City Post has.
What must have been the feelings of
Democratic State Chairman James
Cowgill, when two days before the
election, he was forced to send out
such telegrams as the following:
St.. Louis,. ..Mo.. Nov. '5th.
juuu i. aiarsnau, j
Chairman Democratic County Com
mittee, Richmond, Missouri.
Republican advertisements in the
St. Louis Republic are being circulated
by Republicans claiming the Republic
has flopped to Hughes. This is false.
Advertisements are paid for from im
mense slush fund provided by Wall
street financiers to deceive the voters
into placing them in power. Expose
the conspiracy.
JAMES COWGILL,
Chairman Dem.State. Committee.
And the Observer is not alone in its
opposition to such political prostitu
tion of Democratic or Republican or
gans. Here Is how the Dutler Demo
crat feels about it:
Butler Democrat Ashamed
Readers and patrons of the St Louis
Republic in this section of Missouri
were startled and chagrined last
Thursday to see in that paper, on op
posite pages two "political advertise
ments," presumably paid for by the
Republican National Committee. One
of the advertisements was a four-col
umn editorial taken from the Chicago
News, of October 25, 1916, and
headed "Mr. Wilson as President." It
was a vitriolic and bitter airalgnment
of the acts of President Wilson from
the day of his inauguration down to
the present time. The other was al
most a full page advertisement and
was headed in bold and black lines,
"Back to the Bread Line if Wilson's
Tariff Is Not Repealed." The accep
tance of these advertisements on the
eve of the election smacked strongly
of party treason, and in the eyes of
Missouri Democrats, was a crime
which will not soon be forgotten or
condoned. The St. Louis Republic has
been looked upon in this campaign
as the one great metropolitan paper
which was standing squarely by Presi
dent Wilson and giving him its loyal
and undivided support, and Its action
in accepting such advertising at such
a time is considered as a direct
thrust at President Wilson and the
party at large. It does not lessen the
Republic's culpability or in any way
appease the wrath of Missouri Demo
crats for it to print a quarter of a
page signed editorial in black face
REDUCING DEATH RATE
Christian Scientists Have Much to Do
With Cutting It Down to IU
. Present Proportions'
Vital statistics Just published by the
census bureau show that the 'death
rate In America Is 13.5 per thousand,
as against 16.2 in the years 1901-6.
The death rate In America is the
lovfetst it has been in the history of
the country, Americans are health,
ler than they have ever been.
The decrease In the death rate Jn
the United States began when Chris
tian Scientists started their uplifting
work". Christian Scientists have made
PROSTITUTED ITS
FOR PALTRY GAIN
Its Columns to the

Wilson
type in reply to these advertisements.
A great paper like the Republic, which
for almost a century has been the
faithful exponent of Democratic doc
trine, should never have been tempted
by the check offered in payment of
the Republican committee's advertis
ing, no matter how large the check.
Missouri Democrats have looked to
the Republic as a leader in years past
and up to the present time they have
never been misled or had cause for
complaint.
No surprise was experienced by
Democratic voters of Missouri when
the Kansas City Star accepted and
printed the glaring advertisements of
the Republican National Committee,
but when the St. Louis Republic fol
lowed the lead of the Star and printed
these same advertisements Democrats
all over the state felt that they had
been betrayed by a paper which they
have always regarded as one which
could not be tempted by the money
bags or the opposition. The editorial
management of the Republic will have
a hard time in explaining that the ac
ceptance and printing of these adver
tisements was "a matter of business"
and in the hands of the business man
agement only.
And this from the Milan Standard
speaks for Itself:
Thfe Standard Disgusted
The Milan Standard is" completely
disgusted with the St. Louis Republic's
stand on the late election, as should
be every honorable and conscientious
Democratic newspaper In this or any
other state. For the recognized lead
ing Democratic metropolitan news
paper to sell advertising space to the
opposing political party, is too low
and degrading for Recognition, not
only from Democrats, but from any
self-respecting citizen. To sell one's
birth right for a mess of pottage is
something we could never understand.
Before the editor of the Milan Stand
ard would sell space (which means
one's honor) to the Republican party,
or any other party, that spoke in a
disparaging manner of the Demo
cratic party, or boosted the cause ol
an opposing party, we would wear
rags, grovel In the dirt, pick with the
chickens or starve to death.
And this from the. Gallatin Demo
crat but adds to the wholesale condem
nation heard from all over the state:
The Republicans must have expend
ed a fabulous sum In buying space in
the big dally papers of the country
Papers, which were supposed to bo
Democratic, admitted to their columns
the basest misrepresentations of Pres
ident Wilson and the Democratic ad
ministration. We did suppose the ol.
Louis Republic would remain loy.il to
the Democratic party, but it was no
better than the Globe-Democrat in this
respect. They all seem to have been
"Bought W"h a Price," and if Wilson
Is re-elected he will owe it to the
loyalty of the Democratic county
press and not the metropolitan press.
The treachery of the Republic will not
soon be forgotten. The Kansas City
Post is in the same oategory.
And this to close this story of
harlotry, from the Glasgow Mlssourian
and there could be easily a hundred
more given but this is enough:
There Is a certain class of advertis
ing accepted by the St. Louis Republic
during the late campaign that we do
not exactly like. If the Republic wants
to be a real Democratic paper it could
well afford to leave out the advertising
matter of he enemy. This looks like
a species of disloyalty that is unbe
coming a newspaper, oven if it does
add thousands to its exchange.
this a nation of optimists. Men and
women have "got into the habit of
being well," as Oliver Wendell
Holmes said. Christian Scientists
have worked without ceasing to show
their fellow men that "sin, sickness
and death are abnormal conditions of
mortal mind." And they have suc
ceeded. No gioup of religionists in
America has ever had such an effect
on the people an effect for good
spiritually and bodily as have the
Christian Scientists.
Doctors may rail and attempt to
prosecute, but the work begun by Mrs.
Eddy still goes on. The,; good health
of the country shows "the result of
that work. Figures pfov it. New

WILL PROTECT ALL
The Federal Reserve Bank System
Put In Operation by the Demo
crats Will Make All Safe
That there has been no panic since
a Democratic administration placed
on the statute books the federal re
serve bank act and then put It Into
active operation Is self evident to
every citizen of the United States.
That Wall street and the money power
of the east has had Its throat cut
from ear to ear by this great act and
system is also self apparent. That
the United States can have no panic
In future while this system Is in opera
tion is well known, and these stated
facts had much to do with the success
of the Democratic party at the polls
Nov. 7.
The bugaboo which Teddy and his
cohorts held before the eyes of the
American voter In the last campaign
relative to what would happen after
the great European conflict closes, Is
also settled by the agency and opera
tion of the great system and act. To
show Just how this act and agency will
operate to keep up the present pros
perity after the war closes Is shown
by a speech which William McMartin,
chairman of the board of the federal
reserve bank at St. Louis made thlB
week before the Memphis, Tenn.,
chapter of the American Institute of
Banking, Mr. Martin, in speaking of
It said:
"It seems to me that any bank,
which owns stock In a federal re
serve bank, can go to its customers
able to offer them the assurance that
never again will they have the trouble
that was once experienced in getting
money to meet payrolls. A member
bank can also assure Its customer
that, if he has the proper credit stand
ing and is conducting his business in
the proper way, he Is now under no
danger of having his loan called dur
ing a time like 1907, when such a
call, in many cases, meant the shut
ting down of the business; but that
the bank, through the instrumentality
of the rederal reserve system, Is in
position to extend legitimate accommo
dation for sound business.
"The federal reserve bank becomes
a gohf reservoir, able through its re-
.n ..... ... . o...i i
stream or money to any bank that en-
Joys its privileges which has a legitl-mitteeman as "old top" and requests;
mate need for It. 'him to keep his "eye peeled on elec-
"In the period or readjustment that'tion day." Then it proceeds with the

ported me so generally and
ably, and to the great rank and
file of Democrats and independ-
ents all over the district who
supported me as a matter of prln-

sincere thanks. To the friends
of other parties who on personal
grounds- gave me their support I
extend my most sincere thanks.
To all or the people of the dis-
trict who hrve given me the
strong proof of the approval and
good will of the folks at home I
express the thanks of a grateful
heart and my only regret Is that
I cannot meet and thank you
personally In each case.

a third time but refused to stand for
the office, which process he repeated
when the Democracy or this section
tried to get his consent to make the
race for governor. He had no part leu-
