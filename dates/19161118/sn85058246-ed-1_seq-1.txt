PURITY AN ART
MASTERPIECE
: ATTHE tYRIC
Ah opportunity will bo affored
JLogan lovers of tho silent drama
when "Purity" Americas Dramatic
and artistic masterpiece wilt De
shown at the Lyric Theatre-next
Wednesday ad Thursday nights.
This la ono of the most talked of
pictures In flldom not becauso of its
daring but because of Its Intrinsic
yalue ub a photoplay of art and beau
ty; and Its stU greater value as sil
ent yet powerful moral-sermon such
as the present day world needs.
Audrey Munson greatest of pre
sent day plastic art models is the
6ne who'm tho producers of "Purity"
the powerful preachment, of Apostle
Paul tnaf, "Unto the pure, all things
are pure," and. the universal verdict
is that a bettor choice 'could not
have been made., Miss Munson ir
the model who posedfor practically
all of .tho statuary exhibited at the
San Francisco Fair last year.
In order to correct false im press
that may be gotten from viewing
cuts and posters advertising this pic
ture we make a postttlve' statement
herd that the picture la as free from
lmiriodesty or vulgarity as is a beau
tiful painting or piece, of statuary;
and only prudes can object to it.
The film has been shown all over
the country and thousands have at
tended this silent sermon only to be
Impressed with the truths expressed
by the critic of the Ogden Examiner,
who said: "Viewed in I its proper
light, 'Purity' f 4b a great moral ser
mon such as this wojld needB, and
the glory of' pure womanhood-- un
adorned Bhines forth In such a way
that it won the respect add admira
tion of even those- drawn tor the
Orph.eura.4br morbid curiosity. :1t
tqartastbrpleco "that falls to give
Watk hyper-crltlcal moralist oppor
tunity for adverse criticism." The
opinion of some of Ogden's most
prominent citizens was sought by the
Lyric mauagemunt and In every case
It was tho very strongest recommen
dation aB to its wonderful photogra
phy. Its artistic beauty, and tho mor
al It teaches.

There was once a'smajl town U-.
Haled in a beautiful and 'fertile vat
loyr.The name of the town was
Unwise. --This name was , given . to
It becauso of the peoplo who lived"
there. Whenever they wanted to
buy a package of breakfast food,
or a dress, or a plow, or anything
else they would send to a big City
morethan a thousand miles' away.
There seemed to be no one who wish
ed to buy frpm. his neighbor, or
oven from the people who lived in
the' 'owns nearby. And so It hap
pened that Fred Green, the black
smith, had but little to do, ' and
had to move away, 'and William
Leigh, the cobbler was working but
a part of each day, and somo days
ho did not work at all, and so he
was poor, and Frank Johnson; tho
miller, could not afford to have
any. help. In tho grist mill. All tho
people were poor, and tho town of
Unwise did not havo the good schools
dnd"good t'eache that many other
(owns had. The boys and girls did
hoJrwear ver good clothes or have
yery'good homes to live in.
veryDoay asxed, "way uo othor
people 'have so much, and why do
In Unwise answered the question,
Ope day a man catno 1 to town
and' saw tho beautiful valley In
which It was situated, and he said,
"This is a-Lgood place to build a
factory. I will build It and give
work to all these people and make
them prosperous and happy. And
so he employed- workmen of ,every
kind concrete' men, 'masons, carpen-'
ters and painters and the factory
was built. And then he employed
men and boys and some girls to
do the work in the factory, and the
town of Unwise began to prosper
and the people had better 'clothes
to wear and b etter homes In
which to live, and they were all hap
py. The farmer who lived near
UnwUe also began to prosper be
cause the 'people In,, the town'hnd
money to bay their fruit and grain
and vegetables and other things
which they had to sell.
And thon more factories came and
they cannod tho fruit and tomatoos
and peas, and mado the cucumbers
Into pickles and the cabbage into
sauer kraut. They took tho beets
and mado sugar, and from tho milk
and cream they made butter and
cheese, and everybody thought that
Unwise would become a great city.
I3ut when the manufacturers bad
made all these things and put them
In tho atorqs to sell, the peoplo of
Unwise andjholr neighbors did not
buy them. Most of them even'forgot
to give these home maae goods just
one trial to see whother they were
good or not. They continued to buy
tho things which were made In far
away places. So the manufacturers
had to close their .factories and the
people had no work to do, and the

A HINT TO THE
: MERCHANTS ON

. Much effort is expendod evry year
to induce the buying public to do
their Christmas shopping early, and
with each succeeding holiday reason
this probjem remains to perplox the
merchants. Nowjlt Is our belief that
much can be accomplished, iand .this
voxlnp. question at least partially
solved If the merchants will -make
early preparations for their hollda,'
business- GetfOUt your Christmas
goods, show them, adyortlse them,
push their sale early. It Is just as
mueh-tp'tho advantago of the, .public
to buy early, as It is forpu.to sell
early, but' It will not buy ,astlcng as
tho goods are )n dark basements, or
h)d away In storage. u
A concerted movement on the part
of all tho merchants, , In this dlreq-j
tlon will help greatly. Display your;
holiday goods now. Tho public, nro
awaro of the advantage of early
ChrlBtmas shopping. The argument
of the choicest lots, tho greater sel

by the public and too, thoy sympath

tows of unwise aga$ became poor
anifwent back to Its ol'd ways of
poverty and distress.
, Njw there?, was another town
vr&ick was'alfio situated In a fertile
and beautiful ,valley, and the name
oft this town was Prosperity. It
was Wlven .this name because all
iheJpeoplo who lived thero had
gopdlhbmes to live In, good clothes
to wca.' good food to eat and thcr
boys land girls had good 'schools to
go'tol This town Jiad a good t water
system and paved sidewalks,. There
wasalso a ' good theatre and 'the
nall,team of Prosperity was tho host
in the league.
' Wtien tho town was first sottlod
every) man trlod to help his neigh-,
bor. Tho grist mill of Herman.
Ulack was busy all the time and
two of tho Smith boys and ono of
the Drowns had -work there because
the people bought Slack's IJest Flour.
Late Drow, the cobble?; workod olght
full, hours a day and some days he
even had to work .longer because all
tho shoes to be ropaired. In P.rosporc
Ity came to his shop, and sometimes
those .who could afford It, hadLat-,
maki thorn a brand now pair or pools
Or afebes. When a hov headed
a BUld of clothes his famcr-'tiougnt
It from Leffel, tho clothier and .usu
ally It was made from cloth' from
the mills only a fow miles away.
So .the stores of Prosperity ,dld a
good' business' and many people-had
work; as clerks and bookkeepers and
dollverymon. Then a bank was
established ,and this also gave work
to a ' few people. And all these
people needed' homes and this drew
to the town the men who build
houses, they gave work to carpenters,
masons and other workmen.
Noir It happaci ihat when tho
manufacturers left Unwise, they
sought for another place to build
tijelr factories, and when they heard
of J'coaperlty they decided to go
tfiore'femauah the people wore loyal
to the towh and prosperous. And
factories were built In Prosnerlty;
and It became a big city.
When tho boys In tho town grew
up to young men, and whon thoy
had graduated from tho high school,
and somo of them from college, thoy
found plenty of work to do In tbelr
own town. They did not have to
leavo tholr friends and go away.
As Prosperity grew Into a city
the people had money to pavo the
streets, put In seworago systom, light
the stroots with oloctrlclty, build of
fice building buy playgrounds for tho
children and make many beautiful
parks.
Prosperity Is still growing .because
tho people still buy the goods mado
In their home factories and the other
factories of the" state'. " 'Thfilr own1
factories are -gowlns 'larger becauso
.Prosperity Is selling goods to tho
peoplo In other towris. , '

SAD DEATH
AT WELLSVILLE
Wollsvlllo. Nov. 17. Arthur, tho
20-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Fred
Douglas of this city, died of rheuma
tism at 12 p. m. on Thursday. He
has sufforod untold agony for tho
past four years and tho 'way ho has
held-jiin, hroughUhe'paln, without
a murmur, has been beautiful to be
hold, and It was only becauso of his
strong desire, to live, apd becomo a
Joy and comfort td hls fathor and
mother, that he has lingered until
now. In his past life he has been a
boy of strong moral charcter, bright
Intelligent and ambitious and he
loaves a host of friends to mourn
his' death. Everything that medical
science could do to relieve him of
.his pain was dono, tho family spar
ing, no expenso, but It scorned to bo
of no avail, and tho constant care
tho mother and family seemod to do
more good than tho care of tho doc
tors. Funeral services will probably
bo hold Sunday.
