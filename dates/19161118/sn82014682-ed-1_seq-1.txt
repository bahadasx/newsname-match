! (AtROciaUdl'reu r dtral Wiretai)
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 18 The
president hat appointed Lieut-Col.
Francis E. Lacey of the 32nd Infantry,
Schofleld Earracks, and Capt Henry
Merriam members of the general staff.
Col. Lacey will report to the com
manding general of the Hawaiian de
partment. General Frederick S. Strong,
for duty as chief of staff. Capt. Mer
riam will proceed to Honolulu for duty
as assistant to the chief of staff.
Capt Henry C.' Merriam Is of the
Coast Artillery branch of the service
and Is now at Fort Baker, Cal. There
was some speculation after the cable
gram to the Star-Bulletin was known
this morning whether Henry M. Mer
riam, who married a Honolulu girl.
Miss Irishman, might not be the offi
cer designated as assistant to Col.
Lacey, but Henry M. Merriam has re
cently been promoted from captain to
major and also recently went to Fort
Worden, Washington, so that another
transfer now Is not likely.
This news' received today by special
cable from Washington, will be of in
terest to army folk on the island, as
the appointment of a chlef-of-staff In
the Hawaiian Department has been
the cause of, considerable peculation
for many months: , v
1 The feeling has been expressed that
Itw would probably be some time be
fore the appointment was made owing
to the fact that such officers as could
be released from present duties were
needed on the .border. ; . .
No officer has held the position here
under the title of chlef-of-staff since
Maj. A. S. Conklln lert the department
fod duty on the Atlantic coast Maj.
Conklln was followed by Maj. Michael
J. Lenlhan, promoted to lieutenant
colonel during his time here, and who
held the position of acting chlej-of-
- staff.' ;- - .'

for the all-too-short five days ago when

BIG CHANGES IN
TAX LAWS UNDER
DISCUSSION NOW
Territorial Commission Is Con
sidering Plans That May
Be Proposed
TALK OF ABOLISHING
TITLE OF POLL TAX
Sugqestions Will Probably Be
Put to ruDiic in r-ormai
.Notice
Radical changes In the tax system
of the Territory of Hawaii are under
consideration by the territorial tax
commission, it was learned today, and
though no definite suggestions will be
proposed to legislators until after a
careful study on the matter, several
plans which have come up for consid
eration axe getting the careful study
of the commlsisoners.
Whatever changes are to be pro
posed to the coming legislature will
not be given until the plans have been
given out in a formal manner Tor the
people, so that any objections to cer
tain of them can be brought before
the commission in meeting.
"Massachusetts" Savings Tax
"One "of the plans proposed tor
consideration by the tax commission
Is that now used in Massachusetts of
taxing the money deposited in. savings
banks, the tax being paid by the banks
themselves and being at a low rate. '
The suggestion has been made that
the commission take over practically
the same law in this regard as the
Bay State uses and apply It to Hawaii.
Poll Tax Changes
? Another1 proposal, and .what is saI4
to meet with considerable favor,Js the
person and changing it to a road tax.
At present, besides the $1 poll tax,
there Is a school tax of $2 and a yi
road tax.
If the proposed plan should go
through, it would mean a road tax of
Z and a school tax of $2. It is pointed
out that while there would be certain
advantages to this, it would be a hard
ship on sparsely settled communities
which must depend for their road
money on the distributive poll tax.
Change Collection Method
Still another suggestion thai has
been made to the commission and one
vitally important to corporations is
that corporation taxes shall be assum
ed by companies having Interest in
them. This would be done by striking
out a portion of Section 1241, , which
tays, "There shall be deducted there
from the value of shares held in other
Hawaiian corporations."
It was pointed out today by one of
the commissioners that there exists a
certain corporation in these islands
valued at $4,000,00, but. which pays to
Hawaii through its taxes only. $2600,
which sum is for office furniture and
ruch tangible assets. The rest is paid
on Investments , on the mainland. If
the taxes were to be assumed by the
companies holding shares in the cor
poration it would come to fill the ter
ritorial coffers instead of those of a
mainland office.
It is understood that plans for
changing the method of taxing auto
mobiles so that horsepower or gas
consumption instead of weight shall
be used as a basis are also proposed.

BULLETIN
( AitMM-iatMi Preni byiVdr Wirie)
PRINCETON, N. 4 Nov. 18. Yale
continued the Blue's 'string of victories
this afternoon when It scored 10 points
on the Tigers, and held the Nassau
team safe all the way.
Harry Legore, the big Yale halfback,
came into prominence when he hurled
his way through the line for a touch
down. Comerf ord, the right end,
kicked the goal. Braden added the
other three points for the Ell eleven
when he kicked a field goal.
The game was played before the
largest crowd that has ever witnessed
a game at Princeton, and the play
proved . exciting throughout though
Princeton's failure to score was a Dis
appointment. ; A ;
In the first two periods the teams
failed to take advantage of opportu
nities, and although each had an op
portunity to kick field goals in the
first half of the came, all were missed.
Yale showed a hard punch In the lat
ter part of the game, and Le gore's run
nlng featured the offense.

Calif ornian Smilingly Admits
He Has "Many Things" to

When United States Senator James
D. Phelan of California was about to
board the Great Northern thla morn
ing for the return trip to the coast he
made no definite proralses concerning
his recommendations to the president
relative to the administration of Ha
waii's government, but he admitted
he had considerable information to re
port to Mr. Wilson, and his general
manner Indicated his reports will be
favorable. -
The senator was loaded to the ears
with leis and surrounded by friends as
he made his way through the crowd
to the steamer's side, not a moment
too soon. He was about the last pas
senger to climb the gang-plank and
to the last two reporters were nt his
side, and may it be said that they both
received his attention even In those
last hurried moments.
When asked If fee had made a state
ment to a prominent official here that
he would advise the president to con

office here he retorted with mock se
verity:.1'. ;"How dare you place such words In

of the kind." ' "f
. He did not deny, however, that such
might be the nature of his renort.
Senator Phelan has ben a recogniz

Domingo affair and It Is geherally un
derstood that his recommendations to
the president on important appoint
ments bear considerable weight.
"Will you report generally on what
you have found and seen In Hawaii?''
was fired at the statesman.
"There are a few things I think I
shall tell the president," he replied,
with a grim smile. .
A happy "aloha" was his last word
as he scrambled up the gang-plank.
No attempt was made by the local
Democratic party to Influence Senator
Phelan in :ny recommendations he
may make regarding Hawaii, says
Prof. W. A. Bryan, chairman of the
territorial central r-ommittee.
"So far as I am aware there was no

father In the United States senate for

Senator Phelan'a address was -delivered

the recent reelection of W'oodrow Wil
son. He took up conditions in Califor

for local government; that is, the
right of the state to regulate its in

fortunate in being a part of the Unit

the Philippines he pointed out that,
while the government is outside of the

self-government, there was a question
