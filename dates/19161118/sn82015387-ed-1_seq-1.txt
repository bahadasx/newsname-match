ST. TAMMANY
TAKES IN THE
BIG SHOW IN
THE BIG CITY
New Orleans Does All and
More Than She Promised
in Fine Stock Show.
PRESS CLUB A BIG
FACTOR IN RESULTS
Some of the Stock on Exhi
bition Will Come to St.
Tammany Parish.
The Farm and Stock Show in New
Orleans proved a greater success
than was anticipated, which is say
ing a great deal when it is consid
ered what great things were promis
pm ed for it. It was one of the finest
k. Orhibitions of stock that has ever
been made in the South, and must
have made an impression that will
give encouragement to that industry
in -Louisiana, which, although in its
infancy, is showing remarkable pro
rerss.
tAside from the great lessons to be
learned in stock raising, the Farm
and Stock Show is an exhibition of
the willingness and desire of New
Orleans to do something for the de
.velopment of the country surround
ing her. She has shown that she is
aware of the fact that her future de
pends largely upon the prqperity of
the whole State, and in plaTing with
in his reach examples of what may
be accomplished by the adoption of
methods that have prospered the
farmer and stock raiser of the North,
East and West she has made greater
progress in securing the friendly
feeling and co-operation of the rural
people so necessary for the besnefit
of both.
The New Orleans Press Club has
been a very great factor in winning
- this confidence, and the work of the
Club will tell in the future relations
-of the city and country. Mr. Emile
V. StUer, the secretary, is a live wire.
He is doing an immense amount of
work and is doing it well.
S The following farmers from St.
'.Ibm.any parish have been selected
to visit the Show, and will bring
back with them information that
will be put to practical use: B. A.
Ný." Taylor, Norman Core, John Gotts
chalk, Jacob Jenkins, J. H. Moran,
Tho.. ·Cavalier, L. Talley George
Koepp, Jr., W. B. Keen, Alex. Black

h I, C. F. Dutsch, Alfred Heath, A.
. Lenel, W. T. Wallace, E. L, Goodbee.
'. red. Martin, Elder Rogdrs, Carlee
Sharp, Jos. Schech, Hille iReviere.
Mr. Wallace M. Poole bought some
of the ine stock exhibited at the
atock show and will add them to his
already well stocked herd.
A.s to the merits of the Farm and
Stodk Show, we cannot do better
than to give the remarks of Mr. M.
*Nielsen, who is thoroughly compe
tent to speak on the subject. He is
a Covington citizen, known. to the
farmers of this section, and educat
ed in the cattle business:
By Mr. Nielsen.
A visit to the National Farm and
Live Stock Show, now 'being held in
New Orelans, ought to convince the
most skeptical and doubting individ
'al that the South not only can but
does compete and even surpass other
sections of the country in the pro
detdction of live stock and swine, as
'ell as agricultural products.
There arrayed against one anoth
er tar#he Kings and Queens of ani
mal-land. Beef cattle, dairy cattle
and swine from the North and the
South. The best there is in the land.
Nothing anywhere to surpass it. It
* is an unusual opportunity the people
ot the Florida Parishes have to see
here what really good cattle and
swine look like, to say nothing of
S the wonderful agricultural, horticul
4ural and other displays brought
home to our very door. Are we
awake to the opportunity offered?
We have been reading about those
very things in the papers and heard
others talking about it, wishing that
it might come near enough for us to
attend. Here it is, right tnow. The
people in and around Covington
seem to be awake, judging from the
anumber that daily visit this great
educational ,fair.
The most singular and outstanding
feature of the entire show is that the
mnest of the finest swine and cattle
are produced by Southern States,
louIsiana not excepted, thereby re
pudiating the often expressed idea,
that fool notion that the iSouth can
not produce live stock and swine to
'- compete with other sections of the
United States, when as a satter of
fact we can do better than any other
Section, if we want to. Now let us
-ame if this is so:
Among the dairy herds we and
'the greatest and most dtamed
of Jerseys is the herd Mr. Ed.
ROUMANIA'S ROYAL PALACE AND RULERS
jr
. . . ...
This is the royal palace at Bucharest, Roumania, which country has now joined in the IEuropean war on the
side of the allies. At the right is King Ferdinand, and at the left Queen Marie in the garb of a Red Cross
nurse. The queen is one of the most beautiful of the royal women of Europe.
POPULAR BIGI
TENT SHOW IS
.COMING.
The theatre goers will no doubt be
glad to learn that the 'Ed. C. 'Nutt
Comedy Players, which was formerly 1
known as Angell's Comedians, are to
net'uru to Cbvington for one week's i
engagement Starting Monday night,
November 27th.
This company is well known hera
having played here about three years
ago, and now they return with a
much larger company and will offer
to the amusement see' em the very
latest high class royalty plays.
The advance crew, under the man- I
agement of W. E. Jack, business
manager for the company, is now in
the city making the necessary ar
rangements and billing the city and
country.
The mammoth tent carried by Mr. 1
Nutt this year has a seating capacity
for a whole town and in case the
weather is cold it is heated with a
device made especially 'for heating
tent shows during the winter months.
The show will arrive in Covington a
a week from Sunday Inmd all tents +
and equipment will be located on the
lots near the Smith Hardware Com
pany.
Every Store in Cov
ington Is Rehted.
Every store in Covington is rent
ed and Mr. E. M. LeBlanc is erect
ing a building next to his stcte.
Most of the residences are also rent:
ed, and every newly built residence
with modern conveniences has been
snapped up as soon as built.
Mr. Ryan's News Depot haes been
moved next to the McCormack Gro
cerp Store, and work has been com
menced on the improvements of the
New southern 'Hotel.
ILasatter, Texas, known as the lnest
Jersey herd in the world. A herd
that has carried off the honors at I
every State and National Pair t
wherever shown. Of the beef breeds
the W. J. Davis Herefords of Jack- a
son, Miss., known as the finest Here
fords in the world, anS have like- i
wise carried off the top honors, grand
cham.pionships, etc., wherever shown,
and plhase remember that the above
herds, with some of the others here- 1
inafter mentioned, have shown at not 1
only the State fairs in the South, but
at the great State and National fairs}
In the North, East and West. They
Have made good aqd brought home
the bacon. Something you can easi
ly verify for yourself, if you can jar
yourself out of your slumber long
enough to do so. Another Southern
herd of dairy catt:e of State and Na
tional fame is the Jersey herd of i
Mrs. Galbraith of Tennessee. Also
Aberdeen Angus cattle from Alabama
and Arkansas. In competition with
the famous used-to-win everywnere I
Gurnsey herd (dairy cattle) of Jean
'Duluth FParm, Minnesota, Dr. Pier
son, of Jackson, La., was awarded
some of the howlrs. `Having come
home to Louisi4. winnings in this
great contest, it only fair to state
that in live stock of the better class
we are not so well represented th.is

comes to hogs we have gotten them

PRICE OF SWEET
POTATOES AND
DEMAND
In our last issue, through a typo
graphical error, it was made to ap
pear that the cannery is paying 40c
a bushel for sweet potatoes. The
price paid heretofore has never been
more than 40c, but because of the
heavy orders for canned potatoes the
cannery announces that it will pay,
until further notice, 45c. Ship early
to take advantage of this price, and
ask for shipping dates before mak
ing car lot shipments. To-day's of
flcial quotations from New Orleans
are 40c and less.
For various reasons the offerings
to the cannery do not meet the de
mand. The principal reason is that
the crop is short. Another is the
mistaken idea that at 40c it is more
profitable to feed potatoes to hogs.
It has been repeatedly shown that
potatoes are grown '" this parish at
a cost of 18c per bushel, and some
parishes report the cost as low as
114c. Besides, some varioties, like
the Triumph and Porto Rican pro
duce the enormous yield of 400 t
600 bushels per acre-a very profit
able crop at even 35c.
As a hog food the potato is lack
Ing in protein, the bone and flesh
forming element. 'For this reason
a dollar's wor h of potatoes is not
worth a dollar's worth of grain as
feed, and the farmer who feeds it
exclusively is robbing his hogs and
himself.
Now is the time to start turning
the land for next year's crop. Fall
plowing, except where the soil wash
es extensively, has many advantages.

In the boys' corn club contest the

It is a great show, in a great place
and in a great State. Those of you
that attended our own St. Tammany
Parish, Fair saw some dine cattle and
eome excellent hogs, fine corn, cane
and other splendid exhibits. Now,
I have something to say to .you:
Hop on the train Sunday morning,
November 18, 1916, go to the Nation
al Farm and Stock Show at New Or
leans, and when you coine back and
don't tell us that the cattle and hogs
we bld at our fair here were mere
vest-pocket issues compared to the
size of hogs you will have seen there,
I will have missed my guess, and
thet without any reflection on the
quality of our own stuff. Please al
so remember that the finest of the
finest you will see over there, Rwith
the exception of two or three ex
,hibits, and grown and raised by our
Southern boys and girls and South
ern men and women. No one could
.ever again successfully tell you that
nobody in the South can accomplish
anything worth while. You can
make the entire trip next Sunday,
including admission to the fair for
S$1.60. If you want to spend any
more, that will be your private busi
ness. You could not obtain fqr a
$1,000 in any other way what you
cn get there in knowledge for the
$T.60. I should have liked to have
gone more into details of the various
features of this great fair but either
