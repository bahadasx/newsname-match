Cape Town, Nov. 18. Te nthousand
blacks have been recruited for labor
service in Europe, and are about ready
to depart. Their organization is to
be a strictly military one, and they
will be subjected to , military discip

ing force. They have been forced into
five battalions of 2,000 men each, and
will be under the direct control of of-
ficers of the Union of South Africa".

Over Report of Submarine Campaign
that May Cause America to
be Involved
(Associated Press)
Washington, Nov. 18. The reported
visit of Baron Burian, .the Austrian
foreign minister, to Von Bethmann-
Hollweg, the German chancellor, for a
full discussion of submarine warfare
and its effect on the United States has
aroused interest here, but the report
could not be confirmed from official
dispatches.
Government officials do not conceal
their disquiet over the present sub
marine situation and some fear the
Teutonic powers may at any minute
aunch a starvation campaign against
England that would involve the Unit
ed States.
Secretary Lansing, however, au
thorized the statement that "there
was no truth in the report that the de
partment has information that a defi
nite decision has been reached to
aunch a ruthless German submarine
campaign."

dent of Clemson college, today told
the annual convention here of the na

colleges and experiment stations. It
is their patriotic duty, he declared, to
assist the government to create a' big
body of reserve officers. Land grant
colleges, the speaker said, should set
an example in patriotism.
"With the recent ruling of the war
department that every such college
shall require two years of military
training of physically fit male stud
ents pursuing courses of two years or
longer and with a well designed cur
riculum," he said, "we will have an
end of sham military instruction
which at some colleges has been little
short of disgraceful."

In the Use of German Words and
Phrases in Teutonic Use
and Industries
(Associated Press)
Berlin, Nov. 18. Local authorities
in various towns and cities having
failed to enforce certain arbitrary
changes in language, to the end that
all words of foreign origin might be
weeded out, the minister of the in
terior has taken a hand in the matter.
In a communication to all the pres
idents of individual governments, he
urged that they give up the effort to
weed out foreign words by compul
sion, and that rather they work along
lines of common sense, leaving such
words as are almost impossible of re
placement or translation into ' Ger
man, and urging the acceptance of
other words that may take the place
of foreign words meaninglessly adopt
ed..
He suggests that a list of German
substitutes for foreign words, drawn
up by the foreign police, president of
Berlin, Von Jagow, after consultation
with representatives of various trades
and businesses and with the General
German Speech Association, be urged
upon everyone, particularly upon those
who still use foreign words in adver
tising their trade or business. pz.? p-:
He cites a number of industries.
notably the textile, in which foreign
words are still customary, though they
have perfect German equivalents that
are not at all far-fetched as are some
of the attempted translations along
other lines and in other connections.
In cases where there is doubt 'about, a
good translation he urged recourse to
the speech association. ; -

. That the permanent improvement of

fore and after the improvement of the

along the roads. The matter of a new

(Associated Press)
Amsterdam, Netherlands, Nov. 18.
According, to information gleaned
from seven hundred, refugees from
the occupied regions of Northern
France, who have been passing thru
Holland, the Germans have prepared
positions far behind their present
front. They are, it is said, reckoning
more and more on the possibility of a
retreat to the Belgian frontier. The
positions near Maubeuge and Haut
mbnt are even more formidable than
those north of Lille. The old forts
are deserted, for, taking full account
of the new methods of warfare, the
Germans have .constructed a network
of trenches, and great earthen cav
erns made with the aid of reinforced
concrete and iron.
News comes from Northern France
as well as from Belgium of the in
creasing number of the population
who are being put to work by the
Germans. The normal": industries
have long been stopped, but some
manufactories are veritable beehives
of activity." This is the case, for in

THE BELCH
Taken Away from Their Homes to
Become Virtual Slaves of
the Teutons
(Associated Press)
The Hague, Nov." 18. The number
of Belgians deported by the Germans
up to- date, according to information
given the Associated Press from re
liable sources, is apparently between
thirty and forty thousand and they
are being deported at the rate of two
thousand daily.
Antwerp has been commanded, it is
said, to furnish twenty-seven thousand
men, which is probably about ten per
cent of its able-bodied population. The
entire Belgian population is terrorized
because they realize they are entirely
helpless.
: Women and children are said to
gather at the trains and Jemappes
and many women throw themselves
on the rails to prevent the departure
of the immigrants and they have to
be forcibly removed by German sol
diers. Men are frequently loaded into
cattle cars and have to spend two
days in them on the journey.
ONLY THE OUIIS
!,1 BE UNMUZZLED
Said British Statesman in Reply to
Demand for Removal of
Censorship .
(Associated Press)
London, Nov. 17. The matter of
the destruction of British shipping by
German submarines came up in the
house of lords Wednesday afternoon.
Lord Sydenham invited the govern
ment to make a declaration in the
nature of a "ton for ton" policy in be
half of Great Britain and her allies
as a reply to "the monstrous pro
ceedings" of the German submarines.
He declared that the submarine men
ace was : more seriou than the au
thorities were willing to admit.-
Admiral Lord Beresford said Great
Britain had arrived at a serious crisis
calling for energy and foresight. It
was time for plain speaking, because
the house of commons and the news
papers had been muzzled by j,he most
autocratic government since the time
of Pharaoh.
"Had the blockade been properly
enforced from the first," he asserted,
"we should not have been faced by
this submarine menace."
The Marquis of Crewe, lord presi
dent of the council, replying for the
government, said it was useless to
make such declarations as Lords Sy
denham and Beresford demanded,
without the power to enforce them.
The only voices which could speak
with influence now wrere the voices of
the cannon on the fronts.
"It is useless," said the Marquis of
Crewe, "to threaten to exact partic
ular reparations in the terms of peace
unless we are able to impose those
terms by obtaining complete victory."
The admiralty, continued the lord
president, had been singularly suc
cessful in the destruction of enemy
submarines, but the difficulties in
dealing with this menace had increas
ed.
Lord Lytton, civil lord of the ad
miralty, having denied that the fleet
had abandoned its traditional policy
ofseeking put and destroying the en
emy, the subject was dropped.
were shown some off-hand drawings
by his little boy George, and these
drawings show talent and skill. We
hope George will take some of the
drawings to the fair.
