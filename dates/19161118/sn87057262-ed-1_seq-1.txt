[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
BOSTON. Nov. 18.—Helen Keller,
one of the world's most remarkable
women, blind and deaf and dumb, till
she was taught to speak. Is to bo
married soon, it was learned here
today.
Peter Fagan, her secretary, a for
mer Boston newspaper man, applied
at city hall here ten days ago for a
license to wed Miss Keller, accord
ing to City Registrar Edward Mc
Glenen. The application was denied
because Fagan insisted on absolute
secrecy until th$ marriage became a
fact. The report was denied early
today by Fagw himself who declared
the rumor to be "the wildest thing
I've heard of in a long time." But
acquaintances BP id the only reason
for aecrecy was the opposition to the
match offered by Mrs. John Macy,
the woman who has been Miss Kel
ler's teaoher since early girlhood.
Miss Keller, who has been blind
and deaf from, the age of nineteen
was born ln TuscumbU, Ala.,
June 27, 1880. ifer parents were
Captain Arthur H. and Kate Keller.
She was graduated from Radcliffe
college In 1904.
Miss Keller formerly was a mem
ber of the Massachusetts commission
for the blind and is now a member of
several advisory societies for the
bl&d and deaf.
She is the author of several books,
including "The Story of My Life,"
"The World I Live in," and others.
She is a contributor to various mag
azines.
Mis» Keller is thirty-six. Fagan
gives his as twenty-nine. He has
been employed as her secretary less
than six months. Today Miss Keller,
her mother and Fagan, sail from
Boston at 3 o'clock on the Savannah
line steamship City of Augutfta. The
transportation arranged for Miss Kel
ler and her mother is to Savannah,
thence by rail to Motngomery, Ala.,
Miss Keller's former residence. Fag
an's calls for a rail trip to Tampa,
Fla., after reaching Savannah.
It was impossible to get official
confirmation of the reported marriage
today from Wrenham, where Miss
Keller is living, as her secretary,
Fagan, answered all 'phone calls, and
refused to discuss the matter.
It is believed that the application
for a marriage license, which was
presented by Fagan at city hall ten
days ago, was made out jointly by
Miss Keller and Fagan. -Registrar
McGlenen described part of the
writing .on it as "something like
printing."
The so-called "square hand writ
ing used by the blind fits this de
scription.
At present Mise Keller is suffering
from a nervous breakdown, brought
on by her lectures and writings. All
her engagements have been can
celled and she is going south to rest
Everybody Denies It.
WRENHAM, Mass., Nov. 18.—
Miss Helen Keller, one of the world's
most famous women, who, it was re
ported, was soon to marry her sec
retary, Peter Fi»L"an. today officiary
denied the report through her com
panion, Mrs. Arr.ie S. Macy.
Mrs. Keller, mother of the blind
woman, Mrs. Macy, her constant com
panion since childhood, and Faga.1
himself united in denying- the report.
In a statement today Mrs. Mac/
who taught Miss Keller to gpea!:,
said:
"The Btory that my pupil of twenty
seven years is to marry her secre
tary or anyone else, is an abo-nin
able fabrication.
"I have b^en with Miss Keller al
most continuously since I first cam

her recent illness and mine, she has
scarcely been out of my sight.
"Besides this, her mother has l.ocn

If she had any affection deeper than
friendship for her secretary or any
one else, we would have known of it.
"The story that Miss Keller intends
to marry is untrue.
"Miss teller and Mr. Fagan both
deny the story in every particular
and Mrs. Kellar and I know no foun
dation for it."
Fagan said that despite the state

he had made application for a mar

(were T. J. Hawkinu, A. W. Morris,
Howard Graves, Leslie Weibb and Ber
nard McDonald. Of the ftite of the
other five Americans in Parral, who
did not leave with the Alvarado men,
nothing Is yet known.
To reach Culiacan, the little party
'had to travel on horseback more than
200 miles across the highest' part of
