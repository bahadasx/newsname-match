GRIEVANCES OF P. H. S. BOYS
The hoys of the high school student
body were called into assembly yes
terday afternoon for the express pur
pose of airing their grievances
against Superintendent Park. After
talking the matter over among them
selves. Superintendent Park was call
ed into the meeting and the griev
ances plated before him.
The grievances as stated by the
boys were that he had practically
broken up the student body,, he had
made promises but had foiled to keep
them, and he was unjustly removing
students from offices.
As evidence of their first grievance
the boys stated that Mr. Park, had
earlier in the year year without the
consent of the executive committee,
.ordered a tackling dummy and charg
ed it to the student body.
To this llr. Park replied that he
was not familiar with the constitu
tion of the student body and would
not have taken the action w hich he
took if he had known that It was
against the constitution. He further
stated that he had done many favors
for the high school and would In the
future cooperate with the students in
their activities and would do his best
to please them. He said that he was
glad to have had the grievance put
to him in such a straightforward
manner and believed that in the fu.
ture these differences would be removed.

In pendjeton.
A good sized audience last night
witnessed the high school glee club'.
production of "Polished Pebblea'' The
play was one of the best local talent
numbers seen here In years, the music
being of good quality and the comedy
being far above amateur standing.
Some of the people even thought that
Charlie Chaplin was loose on th?
stage and were greatly surprised to
find that it was only Zoe Carney, a
real, genuine, high school student
He displayed such ortg'nallty In hl:
Ing us town gossip, also showed great
ability in making the crowd laugh.
The choruse.s were well dllled in
their parts and added greatly to the
interest of the play by their great va
rlety of songs.
Altogether the high school students
believe that they have been repayed
for their work by the success which
was made and they now feel justified
In putting on future productions.
As announced between acts last
night the first of these productions
will be given Friday, Dec. 1, but th a
