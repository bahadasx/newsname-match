'At the Opera House next Wednesday
night, Novamber. 22, will be shown
'The Fall of a Nation." The Califor
nia National Guards were used in its
I production and it is very realistic. It
fully depicts the horrors of a war upon
a people who are unprepared. ' It pic
tures the disgrace and indignities heap
ed upon a conquered people by their un
feeling and unprincipled conquerors.
Their lust for blood seems to be un-
quenched, and rapise and murder are
heaped upon their helpless victims
without mercy. Don't fail to see this
very interesting and instructive pic
ture. You will be a better patriot the
balance of your life. This picture will
be shown here before it appears in

i gies of Mr. Fredorovicz, having been

The Rooks County Record remarks: !
"Can it be that the yellow streak is i
strongest in woman suffrage states." !
Whafe has become of the railroad
committee? Has it lapsed into "in-
oxous dessuitude." A few months ago :
we could almost hear the rumbling of :
the iron horse, and the shriek of the
engine's siren. Hays will wake up :
when it is too late.
The days of virile manhood and wo
manhood seem to have passed into his- ;
tory. Ashamed to fight, is now the slo-
gan, and the molley coddles of Kansas ;
voted in the last election for "peace at j
any price." The fighting blood of Kan- J
sas surely has degenerated. The peo- ;
p!e can be driven like sheep.
Poor old Missouri, which is an empire 1
within itself, is cursed by a plague spot
St. Louis, a veritable "Sodom and j
Gomorrah. The whole state Kansas
City included voted dry at last elec
tion, with the exception of the big city.
The brewers and the devil seem to
have a death grip upon it, and the only
thing that will release the grip and
free the people is the grace of God ad
ministered a la Billy Sunday. St. Louis '
needs Billy Sunday badly.
Complaint has been made that the
city dump in the old sand pit on South
Fort Street, besides being the recipient J
of stale and rotten vegetables from the j
grocery stores, is also a sepulchre for
daad dogs, cats and chickens. The !
stench that arises therefrom, is very j
obnoxious to the citizens who live in i
the vicinity of the aforesaid "dump." I
It is not only a nuisance but is a men- J
ace to the health of the city. Some I
action should be taken to abate this I
menace to the public health. Someone
is responsible. We should judge that
it was tne duty of the city marshal to
look this matter up and report to the
health officer. Perhaps, now as the
election 13 over, he will have a little
time to look after the city's welfare.

In the State Legislature, this winter,
the democrats in the senate will be
hopelessly in the minority eight demo
crats to .thirty-two republicans. Mr.
Malone's influence in Ihe 39th senator
ial district will be nothing, while if C.
W. Miller had been elected, he could
have accomplished much for the dis
trict, and especially Elii3 county insti
tutions. However, as Mr. Miller stands
well with the state administration,
everything of a senatorial nature for
the next two years will probably be re
ferred to him anyhow. He i3 the man
that Eheuld have been elected. The
people of the 39th district have made a
mistake in not electing him. He would
have been a live wire, while Mr. Ma
lone, though he hag ability, can do lit
tle more than 'draw his salary.

W. J. Bryan, after making a "spec
tacular'.' failure of nearly everything
he has undertaken, now proposes a four
year campaign to make "democracy
dry." He has probably forgotten the
old saw, "corn makes whiskey and
whiskey makes democrats." The fol
lowing is a New York dispatch of No
vember 15th.
"William Jennings Bryan will devote
the next four years of his life to mak
ing Democracy dry.
In an interview published here today,
the one-time secretary of state de
clared his party cannot afford to take
the 'immoral side of a moral issue;'
that prohibition is a b:g issue now and
that members of the Democracy will
not allow the party to be 'buried m a
drunkard's grave.'
Bryan's drive against the demon rum
will start immediatelv, for he leaves
tonight to speak Sunday at Indianapolis
and Monday at Chicago."
The Kexican Situation.
Despite "he keptu3 out of war," the
democratic pre-election slogan which
won the votes of the women in the
"suffrage" states and returned Wilson
to the White House for four years
more the Mexican situation is becom
ing more and more tense each day and
there is no question in the minds' of the
thinking people that this country is on
the verge of a "volcanic" eruption that
will embxoil this country in "actual"
war with Mexico. The following from
the State Journal of Nov. 15 is the
opinion of Major Sharp, one of the men
who whs at the front during the late
unpleasantness with our Mexican
neighbors:
"That the situation on the Mexican
border is bad, and that the Kansas
troops may regard themselves only as
on an indeterminate furlough, is taken
for granted by Major Sharp. Condi
tions there during the stay of the Kan
sas guardsmen were worse than the
press reports indicated, according to
Major Sharp and other officers who have
returned. Major Sharp, said the town
of Eagle Pass, where the Kansas troops
were encamped, was in danger when
the troops arrived there, and that only
th presence o the soldiers saved it.
People who had lived there for years
were afraid to aUow their families to
go on the streets after sundown, and
withieison. The Mexicans owned the
town and the sidewalks and they ex
pected and received a clear right of
way. When we left, life and property
were safe. The Mexicans would give
an American at least half of the walk,'
said the major.
That the national guardsmen will be
called on to return to the border, and
that when they do there will be some
thing doing, is Major Sharp's firm
opinion.
No one can tell when the summons
will come again, but it will come as
surely as tomorrow's sun will rise, and
we will cross the border no, not cross
it. As one negro soldier expressed it.
we will pick up the border and take it
with us, the returning guardsman believes."
