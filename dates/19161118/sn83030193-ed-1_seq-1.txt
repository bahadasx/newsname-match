response to instructions from Washington for information as to trans
portation of Belgian workers to Germany. The interview will probably

the transfer of the Belgians and has been given a copy of the orders
as originally issued. Grew is personally following all the details of

Says Rich Lumberman.
TELLS COURT HIS WOES.
E. G. Phinney, Who Wedded
Nurse, Declares She Poured
Ice Water Down His Back.
Ernest a. Phinney, wialthy lum
berman of this city and Jacksonville,
Pla shattered oldfashloncd Ideals of
courtship to-day when he told Su
preme Court Justice Greenbuum that
a man who tells his second wlfo all
about his first wife and reveals his
entire past Is not only courting mat
rimonial disaster, but Is foolish.
Phinney Is being sued for separation
by Mrs. Wllllo Pearl Hussey Phln
ncy of No. 460 Riverside Drive,
Tho Phinney courtship was not
without Its romance although tho
couple separated on their honeymoon.
After nursing the lumberman buck to
health, Mrs. Phinney was married
to him at the Waldorf-Astoria In
19H. It was while convalescing that
Phinney, playing tho dual rolo of
suitor and patient, spent otherwise
tedious hours by telling his ntirso his
past Ufa and tho romnnco of his first
marriage,
"That was one of tho most unfor
tunate things I ever did In my Ufa
telling Mrs. Phinney of my past llfo
and previous marriage," Phinney said
on tho witness stnnd. "No man should
do It. It Is lllto feeding your own
ammunition Into fhoencmy's can
non." The first outbreak over reference to
tho past occurred, Mr. Phinney said,
while tho nowlywedw wero vlsltlni;
Mr, Phlnncy'B nlnety-yenr-old mother.
"Ilelng nn aged woman, my tnottcr
showod my wlfo a photograph of mv
first wlfo and myself on howoback,
without considering what effect It
might have on my wlfo ,s norves," Mid
Phinney. "Well, that Inc ident on our
honeymoon endod In a riot. My wife
would neither lalk to me nor cat. She
said sho had bocn Insulted, and for
days wo saw each other but Bhe did
not speak.
"In ono week after that," tho wit
ness continued, "tny wife broke seven
pairs of glasses for mo. You ee, I'm
totally blind without glustes, and Mrs.
Phinney knew that."
There wero other occasions, the lum
berman testified, wh'en hi wlfo do
sired him to urlso at 4,30 A. M, II'J
didn't want to, ho said, but tho pour
ing of leu water down hl.s back by
Mrs. I'hlnney mudti him only too
pleased to get up.
In a final attempt to patch tip dif
ferences, Phinney declared ho sug
gested a thitty-dpy truce,
"1 suggested," tho witness doclared,
"that wo would occupy soparatu
rooms and not speak during tho
truco although we wero to seo each
other morning and night. Sho agreed
to try U for two weeks and If at tho
end of that time It was not a' suc
cess wo wero to separato forever,"
The two-weeks' tryout did not even
get a fair start, Phinney declared. An
other fight started, ho oald, and ho
had to leave.
Mrs. Phinney, who was heavily
veiled, sat wltln threo feet of her
husband as he recounted his experi
ences. She shook her head In denial
of every chargo her husband made.
