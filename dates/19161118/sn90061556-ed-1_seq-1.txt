THE KNOCKERS
I know he must be doing well,
I know he's getting on.
His work has now begun to tell,
His struggle time has gone;
He now has passed the dreary days,
Tho lonesome ones and grim,
And now he's treading better ways
For folks are knocking him.
His skill has caught the eye of men,
His worth is seen at last,
He's left tho thrpng that knew him
when
His skies were overcast.
.. . I
He s won the laurel tor his urow
By toil anl pluck and vin.
And ho is doing real work now,
For fblks are knocking him.
The Knocker is a curious cuss.
He never starts to whine
Or fling his envious shafts, at us
Until our work is fine.
It's only men with skill to do
Real work he tries to block.
And so congratulations to
Tho man the knockers knock.

DUBOIS COMPARES VOTE
SOUTH AND NORTH.
OF
Dr. W. E. B. Dudois, in a lengthy
article on "Why the South is in the
Saddle," makes an interesting com
parison of the southern and northern
vote. It is shown that in 1912 New
York, with 45 electors, cast 1,587,983
votes, while Georgia, South Carolina, I
Alabama and Mississippi together
with 45 electors, cast 315,987 votes..
In Alabama the combined vote of
tho nine Democratic congressmen was
hut 75,528, while the combined vote
of eight congressmen from Kansas
was 483,683. Heflln, from Alabama,
whose only claim to fame has been
the introduction of anti-Negro meas
ures, was "elected" to Congress by
8,100 votes.- In Mississippi SIsson,
another arch enemy of the Negro, re
ceived 4,899 votes. The lowest vote
received by any congressman from
Kansas was 46,185.
"It would seem' says Dr. Dubois,
"that each Mississippi voter (and on
ly white men vote in Mississippi)
casts thirteen votes where a Kansas
voter casts one. We ask in all candor
how long is Republican government
.going to endure such circumstances?
How long ls this, tho most burning
question of American democracy, go
ing to bo 'let alone by patriotic Americans?"

and its valuation is the highest of
any fraternity doing business among
colored people.- This society accepts

to $2,000. In addition "to the insur
ance, this society protects its mem

.societies alono carry over half a bil

business and its far reaching power,
nearly every state in the Union has
passed laws generally known as the
"Mobile bill." Its aim is to make these
Insurance institutions as sound and I
safe as the old line companies.
The salient features ot this law re-
quire that societies carry a rate of
premium sufficient to meet all present
obligations immediately and accumu
late a reserve capable of taking care
of the future increased death rate.
These rates are generally knowh as
the National Fraternal Congress rates,
and are based on a graduated system,
charging according to age.

Nobody Home in California
The followlnff Is tho now famous editor
ial from tliu Chic.iKo Tribune that has
HtlrreJ uji such a tempest In California.
Well, let 'em squirm:
California ls the stato which every
now and then causes the rest of the
nation to wonder how the trouble It
makes can be safely handled. Cali
fornia hates the Japanese. It offends
and insults the Japanese. It pays no
attention to the treaty obligations of
tho United States.
Several times California in a stub
born and belligerent mood has almost
put the alternative of war or humilia
tion up to tho rest of the nation.
Some day, when Japan is ready, a
California offense will result In the
seizure 6f the Philippines and Hawaii.
California makes the trouble and
expects the rest of the country to pro
SHARP
tect it. It may make a war and drag
the rest of the country Into It. Cali
fornia is out junker state in all except
willingness to strengthen the ability
of the federal government to meet
the trouble it may make and is per
fectly willing to make.
California ought to have given tho
Republican ticket a great majority.
A stato which demands the privilege
of making trouble ought to be willing
to meet it. It ought to be willing to
take ordinary precautions against con
sequences. California now seems to be con-
cerned chiefly for the right to bluster.
The moral condition of some little
rotten spot in the interior of the
United States can bo understood. But
i California presents a long coast line

lstratlon which has tried to break
down national courage.
California, -which wants everything
for Itself, is inclined in the direction
ot an administration which blandly
says that America demands nothing
for itself that it does not demand for
tho rest of humanity. What a Bweet
vaporing ot magnanimity for Call
fornla to sunff up eagerly California,
which wants nothing more for itself
than it wants tor tho Japanese!
Tho state which has put tho nation
DR. J. E. MOORELAND
on the edge of war several times
kept It In suspense for forty-eight
hours In this election, when the Issue
was one that should have been de
cided in this outpost state in two
hours.
Some day California may havo a
Japanese governor for a while. The
rest of tho nation eventually will
annul his commission, but he may be
there for a while.
If California gets Its Japanese gov
ernor there may be men in California
who will recall that In a time of
national emergency they votedjfor the
candfdate of the party which wishes
to be just as sweet to the rest of
humanity as it is to California.

GEORGIA AGAIN
A MOTHER ATTEMPTS to aid her
child and Is lynched. This picco of
news flashed over the wires and
brought a sickening chill to the heart
of every human being that had a
spark of humanity about them, it is
needless to state that tho scene was
again laid in Georgia, the home of
brutality and lawlessness. A planter
was reprimanding a boy for neglect
ing his work, say the reports, when
tho mother interfered and the planter
"grappled" with her, perhaps none too
gently, tho boy went to tho aid of
his mother and struck the planter
with a piece of iron, killing him, for
which crime, mother and son paid
the penalty. What impression it
made on the editor of the Augusta,
Ga., Chronicle, is shown in the fol
lowing strong article:
"If ever tho story of. a lynching
carried on the face of it utter con
demnation and disgust for the 'mob
this one does. To repeat the story is
to emphasize its cruelty and horrors
of a mother's not unnatural concern
for her offspring; accounting for her
'Interfering while ho was being 'repri
manded.' And the not unnatural act
of the offspring in going to the moth
er's defense when the farmer 'grap
pled' with her. If, however, we aban
don those discreet and diplomatic
terms, and assume merely for tho
sake of argument, as well as in
defense of our own common sense
and experience that the fanner
was whipping tho Negro boy, that
the mother flew to his rescue
and that the son in turn went to his
mother's aid, we shall, in all proba
bility have a better idea of what oc
curred. "And, perforce, we shall not fail to
be impressed with the thought that
the mother black and Ignorant and
but a few generations removed frQjn
savage, as she was merely betrayed
the traits of the mother animal of all
species. As for the offspring, well,
he is a murderer, and the law will
deal with him. Provided, of course,
tho mob gives the law a chance. But
the thought that will not down is this:
that the mother-animal, even among
the brutes, has been famed in. song
and story for defense of her offspring.
In every species in this instinct the
sariie, rfom the tiniest bird that flies
to the most ferocious animal that
roams. And with our own eyes we
have all seen, time and gain, the same
mother-trait displayed by the more do
mesticated animals around our homes.
Nor have we withheld admiration for
the Instinct that moved them and the
spirit of sacrifice and courage that
sustained them even unto death.
"But it is for this no more, no less,
in its last analysis that another
Georgia mob' has put a black mother
to death; a mother who followed a
mother's natural instinct and 'inter
fered.' God help us, we seem to go
from bad to worse. And small won-
der; for where tho mob spirit is per
mitted to prevail, without even so
much as a general public protest, who
can say where it will stop?"
Even in the state where our clouds
are thickest, it is gratifying to noto
here and there a glimpse of a silver
lining may be caught in the shape of
an editorial expression similar to the
which appeared in The Chronicle.
There always comes that day of reck
oning, and Georgia cannot escape it.
