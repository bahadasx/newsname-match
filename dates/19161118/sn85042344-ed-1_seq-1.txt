Anxious.
LONDON, Nov. 17 f 1 2 : 1 H p. in.)
The visit of Huron von Huriun,
the Austro-Hungarian foreign minis
tor to Herlin. is stated to have been
in connection with a conference with
Doctor von F.otiiniunii-Hollweg, the
Oerinan imperial chancellor, regard
ing the relations of the two empires
with the I'nited States, according to
a dispatch under IScrne date, given
out today by the Wireless I'ress. l'lie
question tinder discnsion says the dis
patch was whether tho submarine
campaign should be continued in its
present form with the possibility of a
rupture of relations with Washington,
or whether it should be modified.
"During the last few days," adds
the dispatch, "the German govorn
ment has received plain verbal warn
ing that President Wilson's patience
was on the verse of exhaustion."

WASHINGTON. Nov. 17. The re
ported visit of Jiaron Huriun. tho
Austro-Hungarian foreign minister, to
Chancellor von l!cthmann-l IuIIwpk at
Herlin for a full discnsion of sub
marine warfare and its effect on tho
I'nited States aroused interest here,
but could not be confirmed from of
ficial dispatches.
Government officials do not conceal
their disquiet over tho present subma
rine situation mid some lit them feur
that the Teutonic powers may at any
moment launch a starvation cam
paign against England which could
not fail to involve the I'nited States.
Secretary Ijinsing today, however,
authorized the statement that as yet
"there Is absolutely no truth in. the
reports-that the department has in
formation that definite decision husi
been reached to launch a ruthless Ger
man submarine campaign."
Five serious cases now are pending
In connection with attacks on the
. steamers Marina with the loss of six
American lives; the Arabia, tho
Howanmore, the Lanao and the
Columbian.
No Warning to I'nited Stales.
Teutonic diplomats hero do not
credit tho report that Germany has
been warned verbally that President
Wilson's patience is "on the verge of
exhaustion." One of these who in
accordance with the usual custom de
clined to permit tho useof his namo
said tonight:
"I know positively that no such
warning has been given. There is no
reason for any such warning. Ger
many has absolutely no Intention of
violation any of the pledges Riven the
I'nited States."
The Teutonic diplomats are unable
to see how a rupture of relations
could occur over the present subma
rine campaign which they say is
being conducted In uccordnnco with
all the rules of cruiser warfare. They
point to Germany's recent assurance
to tho American embassy at Berlin
that no change in policy was con
templated. A FEW AMERICANS

Four (.Hugos in Mexico Arc

Is Unknown.
Ef, I'ASO, Nov. 17. A message re
ceived by tho Alvarado Mining
and Milling company hero tonight
stated that Leslie Webb and four
other Americans who left Purral prior
to the evaeuntlon of the town by Cur
ranza troops had arrived safely In Cu
llacan, Sinalou, on the west coast of

The other members of the party
wede: T. G. Hawkins, Jr., Bernard
McDonald, Howard Gray and A. W.

to have left P.irral on Nocember 2
and to have traveled overland to the
west toast, a distance of approximate
ly four hundred miles. The fate of
tr-e six other Americans and as many
ncre foreigners who wero 'In Parral

INVESTIGATION
OF SUB'S MISHAP
Deutsehland Rams Tugs
Escorting Her to
Open Sea.
FIVE MEN ARE LOST
Submarine Returns to U. S.
Base to Repair Hole
in Her Nose.
NEW LONDON, Nov. 17. The col
lision which caused the mer
chant submarine Deutchland to aban
don her return voyage to Guniiuny al
most at its outset early today when a
convoying tub, the T. A. Scott, Jr.,
wasjitink witn a crew of five men, was
iho subject of federal investigation
this afternoon. Witnesses told a
board composed of Lulled States In
spectors of steam vessels headed bv
i apt. W. K. Wlthey of the conditions
under which the submarine, slipping
out of the harbor in the darkness so
that Hhe might submerge in neutral
waters before daybreak, ran down the
tub which was acting as her protec
tor Just outside this port. The testi
mony came from Capt. Paul Koenlg
of the Deutsehland, F. W. Krapohl,
Ids chief officer, and Hans Kleese, his
chief engineer. It was given in se
cret, but It became known through
statements outside the chamber that
the collision was an accident.
I'lHTcnts the Cuusc.
Survivors who would discuss the
matter were agreed that It was due
to a combination of swift currents
which carried tho tug off its course
and across the bow of the submarine
and to tho darkness which was to be
the Deutschland's medium of safety,
but which instead prevented ready ob
servation of the danger ahead. Cap
tain Koenig would say only to ques
tioners: "It's a terrible thing to lose those
good men. 1 fuel it deeply. You must
excuse me."
Heforo tho Inspectors fix blame for
the loss of tho Scott and her crew
they will hear tho testimony of CHpt.
Frederick Hintich, an official of the
Eastern Forwarding company, who
was the only survivor on the tug.
It might be several days before he
will be able to testify.
The Deutschlund's return will be
delayed only u few days, estimated
variously from two days to a week by
the damages which she sustained, and
not at all by the fact thut inquiry is
being made.
Throe Platen Stove In.
Examination of her bow today
showed that three plates had been
stove in to a degree described by some
as "a hole" and others as "a deiil' .
Her stem was twisted to starboard,
but the general structure of the sub
marine was said to be firmly In place,
notwithstanding the force of the im
pact which sent the tug to the bot
tom within a few moments.
The men of the T. A. Scott. Jr., had
no chance for their lives. They went
down imprisoned in the pl'ot home,
engine room or galley, and undoubt
edly were drowned at their posts,
Tho Deutsehland returned to her
dock unassisted. It was leutned au
thoritatively today that the subma
rine's incoming cargo was val'ind in
excess of 1 10,000,000, set by Captain
Koenig. This amount, It was said,
would barely cover the val'io of the
securities which she carried. Contrary
to reports the Dcutschlani will take
no gold to Gormany.

The priests, professors, teachers, local

started for Germany. Heipg ignorant
of the purpose of Iho summons, the
men bad assembled without clothing
for traveling and without food, and
relatives who hurried to the station
with food and clothing Avero refused
access to tho men, the reports add.
In a statement made to tho Asso
ciated Press today Lord Robert Cecil,
minister of war trade. uttered a
vigorous protest against Germany's
deportation of Helgians and declared
that the people of Prance and Kng
land no less than the people of Ttel
giuin "hope that American public
opinion will show itself not only in a
few days or weeks of protests and
criticisms, but In steady pressure upon
the Invaders of Helgium. to conduct
the war against the soldiers of the
allies in the trenches hik! not against
the helpless civilians whom they have
In their power."
Lie Is Hurled.
Lord Robert reviewed tho measures
taken by the entente allies to provide
relief for the Helgians and character
ized as a "lie" what he termed Ger
many's attempt to Justify Its action
by saying that Kngland was respon
sible for unemployment in Helgium.
"Three, times during the past year,"
Lord Robert continued, "we have
proposed to the Germans a definite
scheme whereby the exports of Hel
gian manufactures and even imports
of raw materials might be made free
under the control of the Helglan relief
commission and that the commission
might control all the funds arising out
of the trade. To none of these pro
posals have we had a reply. The
Germans have consistently refused to
do anything to assist the relief com
mission and Helglan Industry. Instead
they have exacted forty million francs
a month from Helgium, requisitioned
every kind of machinery and raw ma-(
terlal, seized the funds of tho natlonul
bank and have restricted exports.
' Itelgiiim Drained.
"They have drained Helgium dry and
stripped her bare and we all know
this policy was deliberately calculated
to create a maximum amount of un
employment in order that when tho
propor moment arrived their slave
raids might begin.
"Tho Helgians are going to Germany
on no ordinary work. They are to
be caught up and crushed in tho great
new German machine for mobilizing
labor.
"They will be scattered to all the
remote corners of Germany, from
Silesia to Westphalia and once caught
up on the machine, they will never re
turn to Helgium. It is tills grinding
up of a nation piecemeal that Is tho
most horrible feature of tho situa
tion." WILL ItKl'KKASK SI7.I'. OK IWI'K.lt.

This reinforcement was a complete

Activities tonight consist of out

SECRETARY LANE
LOST ATKINS CASE
Ruliii.n' of Washington ( 'oiirt
Narrows Fight Down to
Ferguson and Rage.
OLD PAPERS NOW VOID
Developments Fxpeeted to
Create Interest in the
Higher Courts.
Special to Tim Wnrld.
FoltT SMITH, Ark., Nov. 17. Word
was received today Mom Wash
ingloi. that the district court of thu
District of Columbia bus Issued an in
junction restraining the secretary of
the Interior from assuming Jurisdic
tion of the famous Tummy Atkins
case, affecting a fabulously rich oil
property In Oklahoma.
The effect ot this decision, if re
ports received here are true, will bo
to eliminate the government Irom the
case,, entirely. This will narrow the
fjght down to Arthur L. Ferguson,
Kort Smith lumberman; his father,
James A. Ferguson of Fjietlcvillo,
Ark. ,and Charles Page, millionaire
oil man of Tulsa. The Fergusons are
now preparing to battle Page for pos
session of the lease.
'It. C. Allen of .Muskogee, attorney
for the Creek Nation, contends that
the Tommy Atkins properly Is right
fully the property of the Indian n.i
t if n and that Page secured possession
of it hy fraud. Announcement was
made a few months ago that records
htri been found in the Interior de
partment which would permit the
Creek nation, for whom the govern
ment was clniinlng the property, to
prove that Tommy Atkins was a myth
ical person. Theso papers. It w:is as
serted, had been prepared by the
Hnwes commission and In some un
known manner had been misplaced In
the f'les of the government office.
Their presence waj unknown fi r ten
yfars or so. It was the contention of
tho ether claimants that these rec
c rds concerned another Tommy At
kins, who bad no Interest in the al
lotment Involved in tho dispute.
Owing to the f;icl that the secre
tary of the Interior has taken a deep
pcisonal interest in the cas, It Is not
likely that the Injunction said to have
been issued today will settle the mat
ter, as far aa that official Is con
cerned. Tho government probably
will take the matter int.) the si.tireme
court of the Unite! Suites. Interest
ing developments are locked for.

last evening in the grillroom ol Hotel

fine success which lias marked similar

fiiy of encoi agcmeiit to the women
and men who will visit every home
and business concern in the city dur

secretary of the campaign committee,
iinnoiiiiccil that the handsome sum of
$12,500 had already been voluntarily
pledged lo the cause.
Many of the workers who will as
sist in seciirln gplcdgcs for this new
home for young women whose homes
urc elew'hero, took an active part In
tho campaign for Tulsa's V. .M. C. A.
and all are of one mind that the en
thusiasm Is of the same brand iind
the outlook even more encouraging
that it was upon the occasion of the
campaign in behalf of a home for the
city't: young men, two years ago.
The hotel grill presented an inspir
ing sight, with its t 'am captains, num
bering several men who are prominent
ill tho oil inilHiitry, the state's chief
soured of wealth, and winkers, two
hundred in all, gathered at the tables
around which final plans weie made
for the work of the next leu days.
The various teams were asigncd to
H eir part In the work, and many re
mained until the coming i f the mid
night hour, anxious that nothing
should be overlooked Mint would fa
cilitate the work to be accomplished.
HeV. Louis S. Harton Invoked
Divine cure and watchfulness upon
the gathering and courage ami

enthusiasm of the gathering.
An amusing Incident which occurred
yesterday, on the eve of the earn,
palgn, and which goes to show that
Tulsa Is us one in its desire for the
proposed association home, was told
at last evening's dinner of a conver
sation between the city building In
spector and Col. C. H. Douglas, sec
retary of the Chamber of Commerce.
In his anxiety to faithfully discharge
Ills duties to the city, the Inspector
called Colonel Douglas by telephone
to snv taht an unsightly billboard vva

Informed that the record of the coin
