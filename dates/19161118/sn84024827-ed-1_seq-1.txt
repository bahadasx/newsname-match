CHIHUAHUA CITY. Nov. 17. Prior
to leaving Chihuahua City to take the
field against Villa, General Trevino
made a statement today to the As
sociated Press in which he said the
time for defensive measures against
the bandits had passed and a vigorous
offensive was necessary.
"The state capital of Chihuahua has
been efficiently fortified and with the
garrison I have left under the com
mand of General Gonzales Cuellar it
is able to repulse even a strong enemy
force," General Trevino said.
Promises Result.
"Decisive results could not be ob
tained by sending small detachments
against the bandits," he continued,
"and it is for that reason that I am
starting an offensive under my per
sonal command. My division is com
posed ot several thousand men of the
three arms, cavalry, artillery and in
fantry. with plenty of ammunition and
I am taking the field with the firm
resolution of delivering this region
from the elements that have defied
Divine and human laws."
The vanguard of General Trevino's
column has reached SanU Rosalia,
which will be his base of operations.
He will move south toward the Duran
go border, where Villa is known to be.
General Murguia, who is now'nftving
on Jimenez north from Escalon, will
co-operate with General Trevino.
Chihuahua Nervous.
Chihuahua City is again in a state
of nervousness because of the depar
ture of troops and the appearance of
the Villa scare, but General Trevino's
statement is expected t'j restore con
fidence. General Cuellar Said he
would defend the city to the last

What the Roads Want
Mr. Thom said the railways would
ask for:
A federal incorporation law for in

A measure enlarging the interstate
commerce Commission and creating
regional bodies under it with regard
to rate regulations subject to the en
tire commission.
Amendment of the act to regjlate

NEW LONDON, Conn.. Nov. 17.
The collision which caused the mer
chant submarine Deutschland to aban
don her return voyage to Germany,
almost at its outset early today, when
a convoying tug, the T. A. Scott, Jr.,
was sunk with a crew of five men,
was the subject of federal investiga
tion this afternoon.
The United States Insr -tors' -or
steam vessels, headed by Captain W.
E. Withey, heard through witnesses
of the conditions under which the sub
marine, slipping out of the harbor In
the darkness so that she tr.isht sub
merge in neutral waters before day
break, ran down the tug which wad
acting as her protector off Race Rock,
just outside the port.
Survivors Blame Current
The testimony came from Captain '
Paul Koenig of the Dentschland. from i
W. A. Krafol, bis chief officer, and .
from Hans Klesie, his chief engineer. !
It was given in secret, but It became
known through statements outside the
chamber that the collision wus an ac-1
cident. j
Survivors who would discuss the
matter were agreed that it was due i
to a combination of swift currents,
which carried the tug off its course
and across the bow of the submarine
and in the semi-darkness which was i
to be the Deutschland's medium ot
safety but which, instead, prevented i
ready observation of the danger ahead
Captain Koenig would say only to 1
questioners:
Caotain Koenig Silent
"It's a terrible thing to lose S good ;
men. I feel it deeply. You must ex- j
ruse me." j
Before the inspectors fixed the
blame for the loss of the Scott and ;
her crew, they will hear the testimony j
of Captain Hinsch, an official of the I
Eastern Forwarding Company, who I
was the only survivor on the tug. Can-1
tain Hinsch was thrown from the j
deck house of th tug. on which he ;
was standing, into the rushing water :
of the Race, where he was rescued,
almost exhausted, bv tti crew of the
tue Cassie. following beMnd. j
Cantain Hinsch was unconscious af- j
ter the accident and tonight still was
so exhausted that it mi"h be several :
days before he will be cbie to testify. (

and some of his crew !so will be .

delayed only a few days, estimated
variously from two days to a week,
by the damages which she sustained
