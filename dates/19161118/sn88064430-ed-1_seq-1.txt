State Department officials believe
that dangerous possibilities are pre

the Mexican and submarine questions.

e RECORD-BREAKING INTEREST IN THE NEWS
of
Entire Nation Kept in Suspense While Election Judges of a Few
end States Counted to the Last Ballot Before Result Was
Known-Soldier Vote a Factor.
New York, Nov. 11.--tn the face "of a!
the returns, unofficial and still incom- vI
plete, Woodrow Wilson has been re- lx
elected president of the United States A
with a majority of at least eleven In N
the electoral college. But the Repub- th
lians place a cloud on his title that is tt
likely to remain for I week or ten it
lays, and In the meantime the Repub- ft
Blcans are declining to pay their elec- ce
tion bets. o0
The situation is extraordinary and o'
has resulted in days of nerve-racking
strain for the people of the country.
If the election officials of a few remote C.
precincts in a few states know how the o,
nation has been waiting breathless to
hear from them, they must be swelled v,
up enormously with a sense of their b
importance. For on those few pre- f.
:lncts has depended the nation's choice of
of its chief executive. of
That Mr. Wilson's victory over Mr. t;
Hughes will not be conceded without a
recount in the close states, such as Cal- pi
ifornla. New Hampshire, New Mexire t
and North Dakota, was determined at f,
conferences of the Republican leaders gi
here. Chairman Willcox asserted a re
count would be demanded wherever ,
the margin of Democratic victory was n
so small that comparatively few votes ,
would turn the scales. He and his as
sociates say they take the position ,
that there should be no cloud upon Mr. b
Wilson's title to the presidency. The fi
Democrats, for their part, declared
that there must be a recount in New a
Hampshire, even though the returns a
gave the state to Mr. Wilson. n
That the returns are still incomplete ri
is due to the presence on the border of d
the National Guard of a number of n
states. The soldiers are permitted to r
vote by mall, their ballots being for
warded to the auditors of their home tl
countles, and in Minnesota especially
the vote of the Guardsmen Is likely to I
cut a figure in determining whether the t,
state goes into the Wilson or the o
ughes column. 0
Minnesota was as bad as California I
in the matter of shifts, and as its dele- I
gation is nearly as large, it. too, was a
watched with the intensest interest. iI
Through days and nights of counting, II
the race was a see-saw, with but a
thousand or so of votes separating the
candidates. Neither side would ad- c
mit defeat, and even now both are E
awaiting the soldier vote and the olf- c
dal count. . t
New Hampshire a Surprise.
Perhaps the most surprising of all
the states was New Hampshire. It
alone of all Nor England failed to give
the Republican candidate a substantial t
plurality, and for days no one knew c
in which column it would land. The
astonishing closeness of the vote was h
shown by the rival claims, three days a
after the election. of 100 plurality for I
SHughes and 84 for Wilson. In the dcir- 1
cumatances it is no wonder that the I
maaagers of both parties should de- I

almost every electoral vote would be
vital, the returns from down on the
border were grabbed hot off the wires.
After veering back and forth for days,
New Mexico was definitely placed In
the Wilson column, though there, too.
the president's margin was so scant
that a basis was afforded for the call
for a recount. A few mistakes dis
covered in the figures of the precinct
officials might well swing the state
over to Hughes.
Willcox Demands Recount.
On Friday National Chairman Will
cox of the Republican party handed
out the following statement:
"The result still depends upon the
vote In a few close states. It must be
borne in mind that the returns thus
far announced are, in most states, un
oflicial, and may be changed by the
official count required by the laws of
those states.
"Twice during these unofficial com
putations yesterday In California mis
takes in additions were announced
from that state, substantially changing
figures previously given.
"It is a common experience that the
result of the oflcial count almost al
ways varies from the returns first an
nounced.
"Where the vote is as close as that
reported in several states, it may well
be that material changes will result
from the official count.
"We owe It to the country to take
all necessary steps to see that an ex
act and honest count of the vote is
made. When the current seemed to be
running against Mr. Wilson on Wednes
day the Democratic managers an
nounced their intention to demand a
recount In every close state.
"All we desire is to make sure that
the vote is counted as cast."
Both sides conceded that no matter
what action might be taken in regard
to a recount there was little likelihood
of a contest being carried to the house
of representatives as it was after the
Hayes-Tilden campaign In 1876. Legis
lation enacted in 1887, it was said,
made the state sovereign in pronounc
Ing judgment in a recount of the pres
idential vote.
How Congres Stands.
With returns missing from only one
congressional district in the United
States, the Republicans and Demo
crats each had elected 215 representa
tives.
The vote in New Mexico, which Is
still in doubt. probably will determine
which party is to have a plurality of
one over the other. The present mem
ber from New Mexico Is a Republl
can.
The balance of power in the next
house will be held by four men, one
a Progressive Protectionist from
Louisiana. one an ,independent from
Massachusetts, one a Progressive from
Minnesota and the other a Socialist
from New York.

Farm Vote the Factor. A
There are several great outstanding
facts concerning the result of the elec- A
tion. one of which is that lnolmr, in all
the big industrial states except Ohio. A
declined to give its undlivioel support
to President \ilson despite his claim A
Sto it on the score of having persuaded
congress to pass the Adamson "eight- A
hour" bill. New York, P'ennsylvania,
Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, In- A
diana, all gave the Republican candi
date pluralities, and Ohio's vote in fa- t_
vor of Wilson is not certainly to be at- b
trihuted to the labor vote.
Another interesting development was
the Independence of the West, which Is "
asserting that it elected a president "
without the aid of New York and Penn
e sylvania and other big western and
' central states. When it was found,

The total vote is far lighter in the

some of the parishes a majority of
the voters failed to mark the ballots
for some reason or other. The parishes
voted with the city on only four
amendments, No. 1. abolishing the fee
o system for salaries: No. 2, increased
pensions for Confederate veterans, and
No. 12, the New Orleans bridge.
e The largest vote cast was on
r Amendment No. 2. The returns from
the parishes, scattering and full, Indi
t cate that about two-thirds of them
.k went against this system and one
third for it. It is possible that all the
* congressional districts, except the
1.- First and Second (the city districts)
Id have returned adverse majorities. al

district have filed a protest with the
secretary of state against promulga

The protest alleges irregularities In
