fendant. His testimony was a recital
Of what he found whep he went into
the Moore home the morning of the

damages from J. N. Wilkersdn

1912 which led him to believe ttiat Sen
ator Jones was an accomplice in that
crime .wiil put nis witnesses 55 the
stand "to testify in justification of his
allegations.
WJth the txceptlon of thlB one wit
ness, the plaintiff had completed his
case'in chief Friday afternoon. The
i^maininf itttness -had left the city
thinking he would not be called upon
to take the gtand until Saturday and
court was adjourned shortly after
'o'clock, as Attorney Mitchell was un
./ willing-- to begin offering his evidence
in^tehalf of Wilkerson until the plain
'tlff had rested bis case entirely.
In

.The trial irom 'this Dolnt on Is ex
-.pected. to be of still more interest, as
Wilkeram% testimony is looked to re
'veal hla grounds^for believing that
Senator Jones "had furnished the
money io pay for the murder of Joe

The rebuttal evidence to be offered

sisted that if he was employed to do
so by the attorney generat to "cross"
Wilkerson "he kept it to himself." L.e
mar on direct told of a conversation
which Wilkerson had with him on the
front porch qf his home in Chariton,
in which he testified the detective said
Senator Jones' money was responsible
for the murder of Joe Moore. Lemar
alAo said that Wilkerson asked him
what George Cossoiv had sent him to
ViMlsoa for. Attorney Mitchell spent a
long time in cross examining: Lemar
s^nd bit by hit drew from him the fact
that he had gone to Villisca about six
weeks ago to talk over the "murder
deal" with Senator Jones. This con
ference, the witness said, was held in
the city hall and attended by himself,
Senator Jones, Albert V. Jones, and
Hank Horton. "That rivals Wilker
son's meetings," was Attorney Mit
chell's comrtidnt.
Mr. Lemar appeared reluctant to di
vulge the purpose of his visit to Vil
lisca. "If you had any business in the
world that took TOU to ,Villisca, please
tel,l this jury," said Mr. Mitchell. After
some hesitation Lemar responded that
he "Just went down there-to see about
this murder deal." H6 said he told Mr.
Jones of the conversation he had had
with Wilkerson in Chariton.
Latter Offered for $500.
The manner in which Wilkerson
claims he got hold of the substance of
a letter alleged to have been received
by Senator Jones and imputing that
the investigation of the Villisca mur
der would be dropped was told by El
mer Hyde, who concluded his testi
mony begun ^Thursday. Mr. Hyde re
lated Wilkerson's story of the Kansas
City ^newspaper reporter who is
claimed to have gone to Senator Jones
and offered to s^ll to him evidence ac
quired- by—the Burns agency in its
search for the perpetrator of the Vil
lisca tragedy Five hundred dollars is
understood to have been the sum men
tioned $s the price of the evidence. It
was while the reporter" In the role of
an employe, of• the Burns agency was
supposed to Wave been negotiating for
this deal, that Senator Jones showed
to him a copy of letter from George
Cosson promising that the investiga
tion into the murder would be dropped.
The reporter later reproduced this let
ter in writing, the witness testified
Wilkerson told his crowd, and read the
substance of the letter which had been
brought out by former witnesses.
Denies Grand Jury Spy Story.
When Bert Porter, of Grant, was on
the stand Attorney Beeson, of Jones'
counsel, asked him if Wilkerson didn't
tell the .crowd at the Grant meeting:
that he had listened at the keyhole of
the door to the grand jury room, that
he had coached witnesses who went
before the grand jury, that tbe "third
degree." had been used on Vina Tomp
kins. Porter said he didn't remember
of. such statements being mage.
John -Smart, also of Grant told the
jury that the idea he had gathered
from Wilkerson's speech at that .place
{was that Senator Jones was responsi
ble for the Moore crime. Attorney
Beeton asked Smart .if Wilkerson had
n't related some of his other experi
ences in ferreting out crime, among
which was One in t^e search for a Ne
braska murderer wjhen he "had to
leave town at night to escape the fury
of tb^OttUeqsV. The witness replied

Wilkersonsaid "F. F. Jones furnished

'Mitchell's cross examination.
*Weldon I^adiey, a farmer living near
Villisca, was the last witneSs exam
ined today. From hint tones' counsel
sought to obtain statements that Wil
kerson's speech at -Grant tended to
show he was familiar with the secrets
of the grand Jury room when William
Mansfield was given a hearing.
Wilkerson Accusea County Attorney.
Refering !to Wilkerson's speechi At
torney Ralph Prlngle asked, "Did he
sta$e that Vina Tompkins had b«en be
fore the grand Jury?"
"Yes," Responded Hadley.
"Did he state what she testified to
before the grand Jury?" continued 'Mr.
Pringle.
"I'm not sure but he said he was dis
appointed the way her evidence was
brought out and said the county attor
ney had gdne back on him," was the
reply.
In response to questions as to wheth
er or not Wilkerson said anything
about tampering with witnesses, the
witness declared "he. said they had
been trying to get »t his witnesses".
"What did he say with respect to
Vina Tompkins," inquired the attorney.
"He thought her evidence -.was not
properly brought out," Hadley replied.
Hadley said he couldn't remember
Whether Wilkerson said anything about
listening at the keyholf of the door to
the grand Jury room or that he had re
quested that the evidence of Vina
Tdmpkins be taken before him and the
foreman of the grand jury In private.
"Didn't Wilkerson say he had been
informed that. about

o'clock on the
night of the murder a lady in Villisca
had heard a car going very slowly
around the school house block and
when it .got to the corner near the
Moore house it started rapidly north?"
asked Wilkerson's attorney on cross
examination.
'1Np," replied the witness. Other
witnesses who hgve been on the stand
have told .of a story told by Wilkerson
that on the night qf the murder, Al
bert V. Jones and W. Bi MoCall had
left Nelson's garage in Vlllisca with an
automobile and MT~not return until
the following morning.
Many Women present.
The interesting. feature respecting

From Agrisultural Department.
New Tork, Nov. 18.—An assertion
that western ,rarrflers underestimated
their crops in reports sugmitted to the
federal government and thereby forced
up the price of wheat, potatoes, onions
and produce is the latest contribution
to the high-cost-of-food investigation
Uere. The charge if. made by Joseph
Hartlgan, cqmmissjuner of weights and

a tour of twenty-nine states, under
taken to determine the renson for the
f.igh cost of living and incidentally to^
complete arrangements for a) farmefs^
eongiei'H to be here in February.
Mr. Hartigan's investigations con
vinced him, he said, that the govern
ment estimate of wheat crops in this
country this year was base£ on statis
tics furnianed by the tarmers, who
"Knowingly concealed at least 25, per
cent of tneir wheat crop." According
to Mr. Hartlgan, this surplus has been
held in reserve to be dumped into a
market supposedly short many milliona
of budnelti at a price otherwise unob-*
tamable.
"Action Unpatriotic."
"I do not chaig& the taimers with
being out-and-out dishonest," he saidr
"But the least that can be said of them
is that their action was unpatriotic.
They are doing the same thing in many
parts of the country In regard to.pota
toes, cabbages and onions. I have not
the least doubt that if these reserve
i'tipplies were released we would hear
much leas about shortage and the cost
of these farpi productions woul^ be re

north goal, with the wind behind them.

37 yard line. A penalty set Yale back
and an exchange of punts followed,

During the first period Yale showed
the greater offensive strength but
poor judgment in the selection of plays
nullified the advantage.
In the second period Princeton was
on Yale's 44 yard line when the second
period opened. On the second play
Gennert passed the ball over his back's
heads and Eddy recovered it on Prince
ton's 46 yard line. Then Driggs turn-
Yale's right end and ran to the Blue

The play during the first two periods
was loose and erratic. Yale showed
stronger^attacking power, while the de
fensive team work of Princeton was
better than that of the Eli*. Both
teams lost apparently good opportuni
ties for field goal*, due to bad Judg

would bring the ball directly in front
of the goal posts.
In the third period Yale kicked a
field goal.

Justice B. I. Salinger, In writing the
opinion, gives the main rea'sdn for re
versal, as the introduction of Improper
evidence and the, discussion of points
not in the record, by the attorneys for
the state. The court also says there
was good reason to believe that the
jury would have disagreed had not the
court given certain instructions.
The arrest of Peirce followed a gen
eral upheaval in the Sioux City muni
cipal government. Peirce was charged
with aceptlng money from certain
dita keepers for furnishing police pro
tection. The defenses attempted to
show that certain witnesses had bad
reputations and that their testimony
could not be relied upon. The trial
judge declined to permit this line of
cross examination. The high court
says that the defense should have beon
permitted to show the real character
of these witnesses.
