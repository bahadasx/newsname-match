We hint a pood day last Sunday,
though there was an element of
doubt in the minds of some as to
1 whether there would be preaching

spirit of going to church to worship
God, rather than to heur some one
preach Let us all be uu the job

9:45 A. M. Our Superintendent
is doing his best and we have a
corps of mighty fine teachers. We
need a lot more scholars. We
