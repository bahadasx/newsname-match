Capper Is Hesitating.
While "Governor Capper has in the
last week thrown a number of verbal
brickbats at the book trust and those
hacking the fight on state . publica
tion in the state, he doesn't appeir
willing to go to the mat in a fight
for a larger state printing plant in To
peka. Rather, he appears to desire
that the state printer merely ask for a
sufficient appropriation to carry on
the present activities of the state
plant for the next two years.
Those backing state publication
look upon the recent attempt to pass
detrimental resolutions on state pub
lication at the meeting of the Kansas
State Teachers' association as an at
tempt to tie up any further progress
in the activities of state publication
for years to come. The enemies it
state publication wore whipped and
many believe this would be the oppor
tune time to prepare for a still more
extensive propaganda in the state
publication of school books.

The Pinet resolution asking for an
investigation of state publication from
an educational and economic stand
point, is looked upon by many as an
attempt to tie the hands of the state i
for two years at least by making it j
impossible to provide for an exten- j
sion of state publication. But the j
presentation of this resolution was j
made impossible by the board of di- I
rectors of the state association, who I
relused to offer it for passage, until

Forced Fictitious Prices for

INVESTIGATED IN 29 STATES
Food Costs Consumer 25 Per
Cent More Than It Should.
But Egg Speculators Continue
Cleanup of Million a Week.
New York, Nov. IS. An asser
tion that western farmers underesti
mated their crops in reports submitted
to the federal government and thereby
forced up the price of wheat, pota
toes, onions and cabbage is the latest
contribution to the high cost of food
investigation here. The charge is
made by Joseph Hartigan, commis
sioner of weights and measures, who
has just returned from a tour of
twenty-nine states, undertaken to de
termine the reason for the hie-h cost
of living and incidentally to complete
arrangements ror a farmers' congress
to be held here in February.
Mr. Hartigan's Investigation con
vinced him, he said, that the eovern-
ment estimate of wheat crop in this
""l,J mis year was based on sta
tistics furnished by the farmers who
Kiiomngiy concealed at least 25 per
cent of their wheat crop." According
to Mr. Hartigan this surplus has been
held in reserve to be dumped into a
market, supposedly short many mil
lions of bushels, at a price otherwise
unobtainable.
Declares Fanners Unpatriotic.
"I do not charge the farmers with
being out and out dishonest," declared
Mr. Hartigan, "but the least that can
be said of them is that their action
was unpatriotic. They are doing the
same thing in many parts of the coun
try in regard to potatoes, cabbages
and onions. I have not the slightest
doubt if these reserve supplies were
released we would hear considerably
less about crop shortages and the cost
or these farm products would be re
duced to the retail purchaser at least
ia per cent from the prices now pre
vailing." - . . .
Commissioner Hartigan said that
the cost of food in New York is 50
per cent more than it ouht to be.
despite the fact that it is 20 per cent
lower than it is in most other parts
of the country. The reason for this,
ne explained, is that the city is able
to buy cheaper because so large a
supply of food is sent here.
The high price now den anded for
the necessaries of life is being recog
nized by large emplo-ers and meas
ures have been adopted to amelior
ate the situation. The Brooklyn Trust
company with the approval of its board
of directors announced a rubstantial
bonus for each of its ninety employes.
Accompanying each check was a note
explaining that the money hr.d been
voiea xo relieve tne strain among em
ployes on account of the high cost of
living."
Help Employes Battle High Prices.
Announcement was also made that
the Underwood Typewriter company
planned to distribute $250,000 among
its employes in the middle of the win
ter when the cost of living is usually
the highest.
Food speculators last week made a
profit of more than $900,000 ' on a
single item of eggs, according to stat3
food experts. This week's total from
the city householders, they say, wiil
exceed $1,000,000. To prevent a re
currence of such conditions the state
legislature will be called upon at its
next session to pass an act enabling
the city or state to own or control its
own cold storage facilities. John J.
Dillon, state commissioner of food and
markets, is one of the prime mov
ers in this campaign.

NO POORJARMS
Twenty-Three Kansas Counties
Are Without Them.
Fewer Than a Thousand In
mates in the State.
Twenty-three counties in Kansas
have no poor farms and six counties
report no inmates, according to a re
port on county poor farms in the state
issued today by J. W. Howe, secretary
of the state board of control. Statis
tics compiled in the report show that
during the fiscal year there were 949
inmates of poor farms as compared
with 908 in 1915. The cost of main
taining the farms was estimated at
$124,696.75 an increase of $10,007.88
over last year.
Most of the counties where there
are no poor farms are in the western
part of. the state, the report shows.
Wyandotte county leads with 114 in
mates of its farm with Sedgwick coun
ty second with 50. Shawnee county
48, Reno county 33, and Leavenworth
county 28.
The following counties have no poor
farms: Barton, Cheyenne, Comanche,
Edwards, Finney, - Gove, Graham,

Logan, Meade, Morton, Russell, Scott,
Seward, Stanton, Stevens, Trego,
Wichita and Wallace a total of twenty-three.
Jefferson, Miami, Pawnee and
Sheridan report their farms as self
supporting. Pratt county rents its
farm and pays a superintendent 60
cents for each inmate.
The following counties aside from
those that have no farm report "no
inmates": Hamilton, Lane, Meade,

BLAME TUG CAPTAIN
Deutschland Awaits Conclusion of
Investigation of Fatal Collision.
New London, Conn., Nov. 18. The
German supersubmarine Deutschland,
in spite of its collision with the tug T.
A. Scott, jr., could again attempt her
voyage back to Germany at once. She
was only slightly damaged and, if re
pairs are made, it will not bo neces
sary to take her into dry dock.
When she will prepare to leave will
not be discussed by Captain Koehig
or members of his crew. The Deutsch
land must remain in port until United
States authorities have completed an
investigation into the accident which
resulted in the loss of the convoy and
five of the crew at the start of the
homeward trip yesterday.
Taking of testimony may consume
several days and the decision may be
reserved a day or so longer. Captain
Frederick Hinsch, who was aboard the
tug, will testify today.
It is believed here that the accident
will be attributed to bad judgment by
Captain John Gurney in steaming
ahead of the Deutschland instead of
remaining at her side.

Boston, Mass., Nov. 18. Helen Kel
ler, one of the world's most remark
able women, blind and deaf and dumb,

day. Peter Fagan, her secretary, a former
Boston newspaper man, applied at city
hall here ten days ago for a license
to wed Miss Keller, according to. City
Registrar Edward M. McGlenen.

Fagan insisted absolute secrecy until
the marriage became a fact., The re
port was denied early today by Fagan
himself, who declared the rumor to be
'the wildest thing I've heard xf fn a

the only reason for secrecy was the
opposition to the match offered by

Project Possible.
Berlin, Nov. 18. The movement for
peact negotiations, according to re
ports from the Swiss frontier which
were printed by the Koelnische Zei
tung, is about to assume definite shape
in the form of a Joint call from vari
ous neutral governments to the bel
ligerents asking them to send dele
gates to a peace convention. The re
pirts assert that the several European
neutrals are already in touch with the
American government and that vari
ous belligerents have been sounded on
the proposition of a conference.
According to this story the confer
ence would necessarily open its sit
tings without an armistice being pro
claimed, interruption of hostilities
coming only after it was established
that the negotiations are apt to be
crowned with success.
In authoritative official circles here
t is stated that no facts are known
upon which the Koelnische Zeitung'3

sidered not impossible that neutral
governments may be considering some
such step.
