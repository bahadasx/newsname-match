The national council had given a
place to representatives "f tiie railroad
brotherhoods on its ptogiam tor the
afternoon, hut the secretary announced
that telegrams hn<l heen received from
\V. S. Carte, of the llremen, and 1-. K.

rctson, of the conductor:;, saying they
could not at range to he present. No
replies to invitation.- had heen re
ceived, he said, from the other two
brotherhood loadeis.
Mr. Thorn's presentation of the rail
load suggestions "as preceded by
speeches which brought the railroad
eight-hour law squarely before the
council. ltepi ese itativ< Adamson. au
thor of the law, declared he believed it
c 'institution a 1. but thought Congress
would cnii'-t uppicmeutary b gislution
before the congressional Investigating
committee reports to make impossible
another situation ?uch as confronted
the nation when the brotherhoods
threatened to strike. Mr Adamson
said he was opposed to government
ownership of railroad1 and to the
abolishment '.r curtailment of the
powers of ite railroad i-ninmi^'lons
by putting all rate-making power in
the bands of the Interstate Commerce
Commission.
Mi:.N KKl'T IN MKI' OMA
IIV I* It UK OF IIAIO.N'KT
Mr. Tlioni discussed the history of
American railroads and their regula
tions, adding:
"Th*"- impression to-day is that the
men who manag< the railroads can
only be k?-pt in the ranks and in step
by the prick the bayonet. Has the
time come for a ? hange in the > orn op
tion ??f tb< American people on that
?ubje.ct? If it has not come, if there is
no possibility of the managers of th?*
railroads being -ntnbd to the trust
imposed on them by the people. then
ihere Is an ? ml of government regu
lation and th-ii there must he gov
. rnim nt n? n? i *-h?|?. .
"Wo stand now before the ^f<plc
decla r'ug our belief that the work of
corrcl tion. r<-pt???sioii ami punishment
has gotv far ? iimucIi. and that the peo
ple must pas- deliberately on the
question. We stand further on th?;
proposition that the character of the
men in gener:il in charge of these in
strumentalities of commerce is such
that they are entitled to trust and
confidence because they realize the
sanctity of their fiduciary capacity."
.Mr. Thorn said iho railroads would
enter the coming investigation in the
belief that th* y would be fairly
treated by the country, knowing they
could not expect special favors, and
that they would get nowhere i{ they
attempted to ask them, and realizing
thttt if what they ask does not come
up to the public's rod slick, their re
finest will be rejected. ?
Ql F.STION OF CIIKIHT
IS Slllt tors IMtOHMO.M
One of the most serious problems be
fore the railroads, lie declared, is the
question of credit, lie said there is
so little Wcsirc to invest in capital
stock of carriers that they have been
forced to borrow their money in the
last few years on mortgages or other
liens that make fixed charges, and
that the danger point in this sort of
tlnaneing has been reached.
Remarking that both great political
parties had offered, but failed to solve,
the problem of tlie high cost of living,
Mr. Thorn suggested that if the rail
roads were, given capital to develop
the vast territory of the country yet
untouched, the quantities of wheat nnd
meat and other products would so In
crease that prices would necessarily
fall.
ADAMSON III-:NIKS 1111,1,
is i;nconmtiti'tionaIj
After leaving the Chamber of Com
merce meeting, Mr. Adamson said:
"The argument against the bill Is all
poppycock. The point that the bill Is
unconstitutional because the Constitu
tion states that a man's 'property' can
not be taken from him is not applica
ble. We arc given authority to regu
late interstate commerce.
"The law will go Into effect January
1. And if hy any chance it is found
that It Is not strong enough, we will
make a stronger one.
"T do not fear that the Supreme
Court will say the law Is unconstitu
tional. Read bnck twenty-flve years,

hut it became known through state

a combination 01 swift currents, which
carried the tun off Its course, and across
