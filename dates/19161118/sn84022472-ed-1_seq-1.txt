Eight hundred employes ot the
Bullard Machine Tool o. have been
insured by their employers j against
death or disability for $500,000, ac
cording to an announcement-made to

The sole requirement,, according to
the company's announcement, is that
an employe shall have been in ser
vices for six months. At present, 800
operatives are eligible under . this
clause. . The insurance plan ex
plained by the company as follows:
VAn insurance certificate for $500
win be given to an employe upon the
completion of six months, of continu
ous employment i
"After one year of continuous em
ployment has been ' completed, the
value ibf ' certificate will be increased
to $600. ;
' Tor each year of '' continuous em
ployment thereafter," $100 shall be
added to the value of certificate until
a maximum of $X50ft has been reach
ed. ' , ' ; -
'This plan shall be retroactive so
that all individuals who have been
continuously in the employment of the
company for 10 years or 'more will at
once receive certificates for the max
imum amount of insurance under this
plan.
"To the family, or otherwise desig
nated, beneficiary of -umember of the
force of the Bullard Macmne Tool Co.,
ho has been in the company's em-

"If, at aity tine, while in the? em

If an employee," by continuous em-
ployment for. 10 years.' haa attained
the maximum amount of insurance
$1.500-r and becomes totslljr disabled
through accident, or dise-.tse, then
$1,500 Plus interest will lie distributed

"For instance, if an employee in

and it is determined to extend the dis
tribution over a period .of 10 years,
Lhe disabled (employee will receive an
nually for 10 years the sum,, of $174,
or a total of $1,740. - ' , :
"Should the distribution extend for
15 years, the annual payment v would
be $126, a total of $1,890.
"In the event of a 10 year distribu
tion, the annual payment would be
$102, a tal of $2,040.
"If the ' employee should die before
the entire amount is distributed, then
the balance would be paid to his de
pendents." ' ' '
.' There are now 58 men Insured for

A PROCLAMATION
In the old days, when our fathers
had reached the end of the, harvest,
they were wont to come together to
.give united thanks to God for the
bare : lives, He had spared, the scant
food He had given, and the hard
won freedom He had yielded to them.
To the eyes of other, lands theirs was
not a happy lot. Today, those other
lands are bowed beneath the scourge
of war; their men are smitten down
by the thousands; women know grif
and 'Children, hunger; their cities are
become waste places and homes but
houses of mourning. Today, our fields

t Boston, Nov. 18. The act of Captain

Tfronorinzessin Cecllie, In
abandoning a voyage from New York
to France and Germany ana reiurni"B
hnrriiiT ta Bar Harbor. Me., on re
ceipt of a declaration of war in 1M4,
entitled the- owners of 58,000,000 worth
of gold bullion which was part ox ine
steamer's cargo, to recover damages,
the United States circuit court of ap
peals held today. .
The court ruled, however, that
Charles W. Rantoul, Jr., of New York,
and Maurlee Hanssens, of Belgium,
passengers, were not entitled to dam
ages for the personal ' inconvenience
caused , by landing them at Bar Har
bor, instead of at Cherbourg. France,
The effect of the decision is to refer
the case back to the district court, for
trial on the basis of the -ruling by the
court of appeals.
The National City Banlc, or new
York, which owned $3,15,72 of the
hullion cararo. and the Gumantry. Trust
company, of New York, which was
sending bullion valued a. 4,9,936
ibroadf are Idihtiffs in the suit. The
former .seeks 'damages of $446,828, and
the latter $1,040,487, . The Krinrihzes
ein Cecllio, which is now a refugee at
this cert, has - been ii&elled for these
several amounts. .
The court in its opinion stated that
determination of liability rested on the
question whether the Kronprinzessin
Cecilie's captain aeted under restraint
fey foreign governments. Judges Dodge
and Bingham-held that in 'the absence
of any declaration of war when the
vessel turned about in mid-ocean,
there was no restraint, judge Putnam
in dissenting contended that the con
ditions obtaining at the time were
sueh as to cause restraint and to jus
tify tha captain in reversing his
course. . ;

day and made service on the Deutsche1
land. '
The allegations of the T. A. Scott
Co. against the Deutschland, in tho
main- are,: - 1
That on November 17, at 2:30 a.
m., the night being clear, the wind
north-northeast and moderate, the ae
choppy and tide running strongly at 1
flood, in the Race so-called, between
Race Point and Little Gull Island at
the entrance to Block Island, Sound,
the Deutschland was in collision' with
the Bteam tug T. A. Scott, Jr.. In
which the latter was sunk and all the
crew drowned.
It is alleged further that the v
Deutschland which had been holding
a parallel course on the port side of
the tug suddenly sheered to starboard
and struck the tug, causing her to fill
' and sink. - ' . A - '-
The faults alleged are: V
That the Deutschland did not have
proper lookouts; that she aid not have
a competent man on deck In charg
of the vessel; that she did not have
a competent man at the wheel; that '
she suddenly, changed, her course so -as
to -bring her lnto-collisipn 'wjth the. ,
tug; 'that being an overtaking vessel
approaching more than two points
abaft the beam she did not keep out
of the, way of the tug; in not-giving
proper consideration of the force and
action of the current in the Race, and
in allowing her bow to swing sudden
ly to starboard, in not stopping and
reversing and thus avoiding the col-
Hislon and in not having proper
lights.
At the offlco 6 the clerk of the
court here it was stated that one of
the parties who was Interested in the
filing of the libel papers, . said that
the tug was struck on the port side
forward of amidship and Just about
at the wheelhouse in which was Cap- '
tain Gurney and that the tug keeled
over to starboard and that Captain
Hinsch, who was saved, could not
swim and although in the water fully
ten minutes he was probably held up
I by air which was under a heavy over
coat which he was wearing. It was
also pointed out that probably ythe
only material witnesses of the accident
were Germans unless it, is shown later,
that 'the members of the crew of the
Cassle which was astern or the keep
er of Race Rock Light were able to
see Just what occurred. '

New London, ' Nov. 18 Herbert
Hilken, president of the Eastern For
warding Co., said this morning that
the damage to the submarine Deutsch
land in the collision with the tuc
T. A. Scott, Jr., had been greatly eap
aggerated in the stories that havW
been printed. He said that the only
real damage was the slight twisting -of
the bow. He did not know when
the repairs would be completed,. '
, Captain Frederick, Hinsch, who had
such a narrow escape from drowning, '
is able to be out today but he is very r
weak a' the result of his experiences.
