MINOR CHANGES IN
BRIDGE ARE NECESSARY
Says Plan Belongs to City and That
Company it Not Responsible for
Bridge.
The Nymore highway bridge mat
ter is up again. John Zelch, agent
of the Illinois Steel Bridge company,
today in a letter to the editor of the
Pioneer denied that his company wa
trying to substitute seven-eighths
inch steel for one and one-quarter
inch steel
He stated that his only reason for
saving that seven-eighths inch steel
should be used and would be just as
good wat to save the city some money
His letter in part follows
"Your city purchased the plan for
this bridge from the Standard Re
inforced Concrete company of Indian
apolis, Ind Their show plan, on
which we bid, showed one-inch rods
from the forty-foot spans and one
and one-quarter inch rods for the
si. feet, or center span.
".After the contract was let, we
received from the Standard Rein
forced Concrete company of Indian
apolis, Ind a revised plan, revised
Aug 24 and Sept* 22, 1916. This*
plan showed seven-eights inch rods
for all of the three spans
"We did not request this change
and had absolutely nothing to do
with it, but we believe that these
rods are of the proper size for these
spans, and we filed a letter with the
citv clerk that if the lighter rods
were permitted we would credit the
city with the difference in cost,
which would be somewhere from Jl,-
000 to $1,200
"Other minor changes in the plan
were absolutely necessary, but we
did not affect the strength the bridge
or affect its cost
"Our position is this: We have the
contract and the plan belongs to the
city and we want to build this bridge
according to the plans that we bid
on. but we still contend that the en
gineer who prepared this plan made
some serious* mistakes But, as we
are not responsible for the bridge if
we build it according to the plan (as
the plan is not ours) the only inter
est we had in suggesting the changes
was that we thought it would make
a more uniform, bridge and cost the
clU less money
