FARMER BLAMED
FOR (UGH COST
Of F000STIFFS
"Knowingly" Underestimat
ed Wheat Crop, Charges
Jos. Hartigan.
THEY THUS FORCED
UP GRAIN PRICES
Government Estimate Based
on Statistics Which were
Inadequate, He Says.
New York, Nov. 18.—An assertion
that western farmers underestimated
their crops in reports submitted to
the federal government, thereby forc
ing up the price of wheat, potatoes,
onions and cabbage, is the latest con
tribution to the high cost of food in
vestigation here. The charge was
made by Joseph 'Hartigan, commis
sioner of weights and measures, who
just returned from a tour of 29 states,
undertaken to determine the reason
for the high cost of living and in
cidentally to complete arrangements
for a farmers' congress here in Feb
ruary. Hartigan said his investiga
tion convinced him the government
estimate of the wheat crop in this
country this year was based on statis
tics furnished by farmers who "know
ingly concealed at least 25 per cent
of their wheat crops."

by
BROWN ARMY
"White" Brigade Driven Be
fore Them—30-mile
Forced March.
Brownsville, Tex., Nov. 18.—Two
events attracted much attention today
in the '.'Brown" and "White" army
maneuvers in this district. The first
was the spectacular entry into San
Benito, 19 milus north of Brownsville,
by the "Brown" or Invading forces,
driving the defending "White" bri
gade before them. The second was
an extraordinary 80-mlle forced
march by a brigade of artillery and
a provisional regiment of cavalry
from Llano Grande to Harlingen, re
inforcing the "White" brigade under
Colonel H. L. Bullard, which Is de
fending the United States from a for
eign invasion of the "Browns."
This reinforcement was a complete
surprise to the "Browns" forces and
tends to make more difficult driving
back of the advanced "White" brl
gado.
Last night the "invading" division
camped Just north of San Benito and
the "defending" brigade, its rein
forcement of artillery and cavalry a
short distance behind, halted one and
a half miles south of Harlingen, on
Arroyo Colorado.
Activities last night consisted of
outpost and cavalry patrols.

UESH0N
AGAIN BECOMES
AN ACUTE ISSUE
Teuton Effort to Starve the
British Might Involve
United States.
GERMANY SAID TO
HAVE BEEN WARNED
Five Serious Cases Now
Pending in Diplomatic Dis
cussion—Germans Confer
Washington, Nov. 18.—The report
ed visit of. Baron von Burian, the
Austro-Hungarian foreign minister to
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
at Berlin for a full discussion of sub
marine warfare and its effect on the
United States aroused Interest here.
Government officials do not con
ceal their disquiet over the present
submarine situation and some of them
fear the Teutonic powers may at any
moment launch a starvation cam
paign against England which could
not fail to Involve the United States.
Secretary Lansing today, however,
authorized the statement that w.s yet
"there is absolutely no truth in the
reports that the department has in
formation that a definite decision has
been reached to launch a ruthless
German submarine campaign."
Five serious cases are now pending,
the sinking of the British steamer
Marina without warning and with the
loss of six American lives the sinking
of the British liner Arabia, also ap
parently by a torpedo and without
warning the shelling of the boats o'
the survivors of the British steamer
Rowanmore, which had fled, and the
sinking of the American 'steamers
Lanao and Columbian for carrying
contraband.
Investigation is being made in all
cases but has not yet been completed.
Teutonic diplomats here do not
credit the report that Germany has
been warned verbally that President
Wilson's patience is "on the verge of
exhaustion." One of these who, in ac
cordance with the usual custom de
clined to permit the use of his
name, said tonight:
"I know positively that no such
warning has been given. There is no
reason for any such warning. Ger
many has absolutely no Intention of
violating any of the pledges given the
United State*."..
The Teutonic '"diplomat* are Unable
to see' how a rupture ef .relations
could occur over the present subma
rine campaign, which they say is be
ing conducted in accordance with all
the rules of cruiser warfare. They
point to Germany's recent assurance
to the American embassy at Berlin
that no change In policy was 'con
templated.
London, Nov. 18.—Underwriters
here virtually have abandoned hope
for the safety of the steamer A. D.
Davidson, owned by the French gov
ernment and having Americans in its
crew. The rate of ninety guineas per
cent quoted yesterday for reinsur
ance on the vessel, a life boat of
which was washed ashore in Cornwall
early this month. The Davidson has
been on the overdue list for some
time.

Naval Experts Says We
Could Establish Best Base
on Culebra Island.
New York, Nov. 18.—Captain A. P.
Niblack, United States, navy. In a pa
per -before the conference of U. S.
naval architects, in dealing with naval
stations and. naval bases, declared that
Culebra island, which he described as
the peutraliser of Bermuda and the
British West Indies positions, was
"the ideal out-lying strategical base."
For the price for which the United
States could purchase the Danish West
Indies, he asserted, it could make
them useless strategically to any one
elBe by spending the money on Cule
bra, only twenty miles distant from
St. Thomas.
Captain Niblack, referring to "spe
cial considerations of the case or tms
country which require clear recogni
tion," said:
"We are the sole remaining victim
in the whole world of the voluntary
military system which Is enormously,
expensive per unit, prohibitive in the
cost of providing 'adequate' personnel
for the land and sea forces, and fool
ishly extravagant in pensions. In the
cost of recruiting and the Induce
ments, pap and 'bounties' which it is
necessary to offer."
Captain ^Niblack declared also that
"a large percentage of our population
consists of undigested and unassiml
lated foreigners of whose Individual
loyalty we must entertain serious
doubts."
Rear Admiral Jacob A. Miller, Unit
ed States.navy (retired), in address
ing the -socoety asserted that an in
land waterway between New York and
Boston coald be so improved as to
make the area almost Impregnable,
for an expenditure less than the cost
of a single superdreadnaught.
A line of mines extending from
Montauk 'Point to Martha's Vineyard
and from Provlncetown to Salem, he
declared would form a line of trench
es that would successfully guard the
American navy and merchant marine
from Interference in their passage
through the inland waterwav.

Neutrals in Touch With

Swiss Dispatch Says.
Berlin, Via London, Nov. 18.—The
movement for peace negotiations, ac
cording to reports from "the Swiss
frontier," which were printed by the
Koelnisch Zeitung, is about to assume
definite shape in the form of a joint
call from the various neutral govern
ments to belligerents, asking them to
send delegates to a peace conferenee.
Reports assert that several Eu
ropean neutrals already are in touch
with the American government, and
that various beligerents have been
sounded on the proposition of a con
ference. According to this story the
conference would necessarily open its
settings without an armistice being
proclaimed, hostilities to be inter
rupted only when the success of the
conference is assured.
"SLAVE RAIDS
IN BELGIUM
SflRSBRITAIN
Lord Cecil Says England
Tried to Avert German
Despoliation,
London, Nov. 18.—Lord Robert
Cecil, minister of war trade, in am
plifying his statement to the Asso
ciated Press in the form of a vigor
ous protest against Germany's depor
tation of Belgians:
"Three times during the past year,"
said Lord Robert, "we have proposed
to the Germans a definite scheme
whereby the exports of Belgian man
ufacturers and even imports of raw
materials might be made free under
the control of the Belgian Relief
committee, and that the commission
might control all the funds arising
out of the trade. To none of these
proposals have we had a reply. The
Germans have consistently refused to
do anything to assist the relief com
mission or to aid Belgian industry.
Instead, they have exacted forty mil
lion francs a month from Belgium,
requisitioned every kind of machin
ery and raw material, seized the funds
of the National bank and restricted
exports.
Have Stripped Belgian Bare.
"They have drained Belgium dry
and stripped her bare, and we all
know this policy was deliberately
calculated to create a maximum
amount of unemployment In order
that when the proper moment arrived
their slave raids might begin.
"Further, the Germans justify their
action on the ground that the unem
ployment they themselves created
had become so bad as to overstrain
the resources of the poor relief. This
is the most impudent thing even
Germany has said since the war be
gan. You might think the poor relief
referred to came from Germany or
from Belgium. As a matter of fact it
comes from the allies through the re
lief commission. England alone, in
the last eighteen months, has advanc-:
ed some $50,000,000 for food and poor I
relief. This money goes from us free
ly, and without conditions, except
that it shall be under neutral control,
"Crushing Exiles in Great Machine."
"It is kind of the Germans, to be
so anxious not to overstrain our re
sources, but It is fair to ask what
right the Germans have to make the
charity of the world an excuse for
enslaving those who receive it.
"The Belgians are going to Ger
many on no ordinary work. They are
to be caught up and crushed in the
great new German machine for mo
bilizing labor.
"They will be scattered to the re
mote corners of Germany, from Si
lesia to Westphalia and, once caught
upon the machine, they will never re
turn to Belgium. It is this grinding
up of a nation piecemeal that is the
moat horrible feature of the situa
tion.
"Lastly, it must be remembered
that the allies can and will liberate
Belgian territory. Meanwhile, they
can and will bear the burden of keep
ing the Belgians from starvation.
But their cannot protect the Belgians
from slavery they cannot Insure that
when Belgium is liberated it will be
a nation and not a desert. It is only
the neutrals who can do this by the
exercise of their public opinion."
Lord Robert concluded with an ex
pression of hope that the pressure of
American public opinion would bring
about this result.
