Hopes of Visitors Blasted When Bill and

UNUSUAL DEFENSE
MAINTAINED BY RENO
Game of Many Punts Gives C. II. S. Second
Victory of Season Over Reno's Squad
With Score of 20 to 3
Owing to the Inability of Chlcka
sha's men to break through tho unus
ual defense maintained by Fl Reno's
heretofore weak aggregation, the
game for the greater part of the first
half hung in much doubt so far as the
hopes of the local siniad were con
cerned and when the firm half told n
story of three to o with the larger end
of the count credited to the former
vlr.tim of Chlckasha's football science,
local fans doubted for the first time
this season tho ability of Reed's cham
pionship squad to master any team in
the slate. Kven the pep which former
ly abounded in the team itself seemed
for the moment to fag and perfectly
loyal rooters began to admit that this
was Indeed the surprise game of the
season. Fo ra moment, visiting enthu
siasts went wild and pandemonium
broko out on the sido lines. Was it
i -xiiilo that an aggregation with no
percentage to their credit would thus
easily carry off tho laurels from the
team which headed the association?
If ii 'Jeed such was not the state of af
fairs, tho prospects at. least pointed
to mich an Incongruity.
The condition that thus existed
may be accounted for in a number of
ways. Ta begin with, throe of Chlck
asha's most important men were out
on the account of Injuries received In
tho recent Shawnee game. Goetting,
the indlspensiblo full on tho local
eleven, had been disabled in practice
scrimmage as the result of a badly
sprained ankle. Riddle failed to ap
pear on the docket owing to severe in
ternal bruises of long standing. H.
Hill did not appear on the lineup due
to hurts sustained in a recent enitaee
ment. In spite of the thus impaired
strength, the home warriors entered
the game with all vacancies filled by
substitutes, some of which were, of
course, not seasoned veterans as are
the regulars.
A Worthy Foe.
From tho start it was clearly seen
that El Reno's eleven was by wo
means the same that had been so
easily defeated by the. purple and gold
at the beginning of the season. Much
