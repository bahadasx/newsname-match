Where labor controls it is, of
course, a different story. That is the
purpose of unionism and it was to
gain an organization and some con­
trol over the job, the biggest thing in
a worker's life, that the Mesaba
Range Iron Miners struck this sum­
mer. It is clear to anyone having the
slightest idea of industrial conditions,
'hat there must be intolerable things
confronting them when near twenty
thousand men of various races, un­
organized and distributed over a large
territory go out on spontaneous
^stitike. .To organize quietly during
times of comparative industrial peace,
is impossible in a district controlled
by the steel trust whose stool-pigeons
and sluggers saw that no worker
who breathed a word of unionism,
could work or live on the Mesaba
RANGE TRIALS TO DECIDE
MEN'S RIGHT TO ORGANIZE
By HARRISON GEORGE.
Special Investigator for The Labor World.
The coming trials of the workers arrested for murder during
the Mesaba Range strike will decide a question of extreme import­
ance to labor.
The question is this: Is an organizer responsible for the acts of
strikers, fanatics^ and company gunmen during the progress of a
strike?
In other words it means the right to organize without having
the organizer choked by the hang-man's noose.
For nearly 30 years the Chicago Haymarket decision has been
used against leaders the employers wanted to "get" in a labor war.
Last year John Lawson of the United Mine Workers of America
was convicted under this outrageous precedent.
The right to work is supposed to be an inalienable and a natural
right, accorded to man by man, upon recognition of the fact—that
labor is the basis of life Yet we find that in practice, this so-called
"right" is not operative and the theory falls before facts, actually
before the one fact—that where organized labor does not control
industry—no man has the "right to work" except at the terms of
the emplover and the whims of "straw-bosses."
Range. The contract system gave to
grafting foremen a mems to deny the
'right to work' to all but those paying
them private graft the whole Range
being but a modern industrial feudal
i: m.
There are hundreds of affidavits,
investigated and proven true by offi
ci^ls, showing how men were forced
^uiough fear of losing their jobs to
buy lottery tickets, etc., from mine
captains, to paj. them rebates from
wages offered and supposedly re­
ceived and give to their bosses a cer­
tain sum each mcnth besides pres­
ents—boxes of cigars, whiskey, etc., to
secure the 'right to work'. There are
also affidavits, many of them, show­
ing that the, captains forced their
lust upon the women of miners whose
jobs they controlled. Such was the
•right to work' under steel trust rule.
It will in fact be decided at this
trial, whether an organizer must be
responsible for every act done in a
strike zone whether done by a
striker or by a gunman which means
to labor as a whole, whether it has
any real right to organize without
having the organizer choked by the
hang-man's noose. For nearly thirty
years the Chicago Haymarket Deci­
sion has been used against any labor
leader the bosses wished to "get" in
labor wars. Last year John Lawson
of the U. M. W. of A. was convicted
In Colorado under this outrageous
precedent anJ in order to end this
living danger to all organized labor
the best attornies obtainable are
going to endeavor at this trial to kill
the force of this precedent for all
time. It means a great deal to labor
—does this fight which though dis­
tant on the map, perhaps, from sime
sections is none the less their fight.
In some cases where the strikers
are charged with minor offenses,
some of whom are now on trial: the
writer has seen the most questifftiable
testimony, apparent frame-ups, being
given Iby the state which is backed by
the pitiless powers of the steel trust
and it is apparent that here in the
6mall city of Virginia, Minnesota, the
coming month will see the beginning
of the most important legal battle
waged in the cause of labor during
this decade.
Next week the writer will expose
the most amazing methods by which

LOCAL TYPOS
Typographical union, Duluth local
136, has won its demand for an in­
crease of wages, it wa» announced

and night workers from $26 to $27.50
a week.
The increases were given by the
two Duluth newspapers after a series
of conferences and concessions from
both sides.
High cost of living and the increas­
ing price of necessities were the rea­
sons for the demand.
COCKRAN TO DEFEND

Pi. COLLEGE
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 16.—Free
speech is again an issue at the Uni­
versity of Pnnsylvania.
Notices sent by Dean William Mc
Clellan, Wharton school, to his fac­
ulty, demanding an accounting from
every professor and assistant profess­
or concerning their private activities,
are interpreted as a renewal of the
fight to muzzle professors on public
questions.
A meeting of the Wharton school
faculty considered Dean McClellan's
notices but would make no public an­
nouncement of aijy action decided on.
Takes Dean to Account.
Morris L. Cooke, former director of
public works, publicly took Dean Mc­
Clellan to task in an address to the
City club, Cleveland. He declared Mc
lellan was the personal selection -of
Provost £mith following the resigna­
tion of Dean McCrea after the Scott
Nearing fight for free speech.
Cooke then showed McClellan rep­
resented the Philadelphia Electric
company in its rate fight with the
city. As a consulting engineer, Mc­
Clellan testified that rates of the
company might be based on a fair
valuation of $50,367,359. F. H. B.
Paine, the partner of McClellan, testi­
fied to a valuation of $69,367,800.
But the rate case was settled on a
valuation of only $30,000,000. Di­
rector Coke then said:
"This may be said to measurably
fix the new dean's school of economic
thought.
Faculty on Public Side.
"The Wharton school is the admin­
istrative and business school of the
University of .Pennsylvania. The mem­
bers of its faculty are a distinctly pro­
gressive group and their individual
and collective activity in public af­
fairs—always let it be understood ogi
the side of the public—has' always
been understood to be a matter of
concern to the dominant group of the
board of trustees—spokesmen as they
are of big business and particularly
of utility business. There is little
that is necessarily wrong in any of
this. But surely such a group^ofiacts
have social significance and are -pt-o
per matters for public discussion."

GIVING THE LAND BACK TO^THE MEXICAN PEONS.
DETROIT, i.i:ch., Nov 16.—When
Judge Collingjnfood p_gj^ed sentence
on Martha Bain, Anna Hoffman and
Celia Orkey, three striking cigar
makers who had been guilty of vio­
lating an injunction that restrained
them from picketing a cigar shop
where they had been previously em­
ployed, he was astonished at the non­
chalant and indifferent manner in
which they accepted the sentence he
imposed. At the conclusion of the
judge's imposition of prison sen­
tences, Miss Haffman Said: "I thank
you, judge, for your sentence of fif­
teen days."
"If I am guilty on the testimony
of these 'scabbers,' I am willing to
take my fifteen days," was Miss Ok
rey's challenge to the judge.
"So I get thirty days for striking
for a Jivmg wage, eh?" was Miss
Bain's defiant response to the an­
nouncement of the judge.
Judge Collingwood had been
brought in from Lansing to try the
strikers and impose sentence, quite a
common practice that has been intro­
duced lately probably to shift the re­
sponsibility that might follow a local
judge when he should appeal to the
workers for re-election.
Five others were brought into court
and found guilty of picketing and
sentence was deferred until Nov. 18.
BOSTON, Nov. 16.—Special *agents
of the United States department of
justice have started an investigation
of the recent rise in the price of an­
thracite coal in Massachusetts, and
will soon inquire into food prices.
United States District Attorney
George W. Anderson'of this city, un­
der whose prosecution the probe is
being made, admitted this.
Following a similar investigation in
New York the retail prices of coal in
that city yesterday dropped from
more than $12 to $8 and $10 a ton.
Inquiry to Be Made.
The probe will extend to all New
England cities.
The investigation is the result of an
order by the attorney general at
Washington.
Anderson ,said he intends to ascer­
tain whether or not the anti-trust act
yas violated in the rise of coal and
foods. He declared that he intends to
find out whether there was collusion
between independent dealers or
whether it was caused by the pro­
ducers, the railroads or the dealers
and brokers.

Politics are Hinted.
The investigation will be complete,
he declared.
"Why," said Anderson, "should
persons be compelled to pay exorbi­
tant prices for coaL? There seems to
be plenty of it on hand and I intend
to get down to the cause."
It Is hinted politics had something
to do with tine,coal ilse. The increase

DTJLUTH AND SUPERIOR, NOVEMBER 18,1916. TWO CENTS.
BAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 17.—Com
plete success of municipal ownership
of street railway lines in this city is
testified to by The Bulletin, which
says:
"Municipal ownership did not win
its fight in San Francisco without a
struggle. It is not difficult to remem­
ber the weighty arguments that were
used to discourage the taking over
of the Geary street road. One argu­
ment was that the road was certain
to be mismanaged, since it was a mu­
nicipal enterprise, and all municipal
enterprises are doomed to be mis­
managed that it would fail to pay
expenses, and that the taxpayers
would have to make good an annual
deficit. Now the success of the city
lines is so generally taken for grant­
ed that the yearly reports of net
profits creates no surprise.
"Because the feat has been quietly
accomplished, the man in the street
—or, rather, in the street car—does
not marvel that his transportation
managers have been able to meet all
operating expense#, all overhead
charges, and still have nearly 520,000
in the cash register. But his silent
acceptance of the gift of honest
transportation does not represent
apathy.
"If anybody tried to take the mu­
nicipal roads away from the city his
roar of indignation would be heard
across the continent.
"This is the way new issues make
their way in the world—first to be
fought over, then to be installed un­
der the pressure of a majority, and
finally to be cheerfully accepted by
everyone as an every day mater of
course, like sunrise and breakfast."
BRICKLAYERS JOIN
FEDERATION OF LABOR
Duluth bricklayers have officially
affiliated with the American Federa­
tion of Labor, it was announced this
week, and have secured a charter.
They will now send representatives,
three, to the Federated Trades As­
sembly.
The bricklayers* organization is
progressing at such a rapid rate, ac­
cording to officers, that they felt the
necessity for a voice in the labor
movement of this city.
FIRED BECAUSE

BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Nov. 16.—
The bakery workers organized a
union with a charter from the Bak­
ers' and Confectionery Workers' In­
ternational Union, and among those
composing the new body were some
employes of the American Baking
company, which also operates bak­
eries in the cities of Jacksonville,
Fla. Atlanta, Ga., and Chattanooga,
Tenn. There are no unionsAin the
three last-named cities. All employes
of the American Baking company

EXECUTIVE BOARD REVIEWS
WORK AND URGES REFORMS
BALTIMORE, Md., Nov. 17.—The American Federation of Labor
Convention opened here Monday with the reports of committees' and
routine business occupying the attention of delegates for the first
few days.
The report of the executive council was the most important. The
council recommended the Gary school system for adopton, reiterated
its stand of 1906, Wing for political action for labor legislation, de­
nunciation of the Canadian Lemieux act for the settling of labor
disputes and a denuncation of the rapidly increasing activity of the
judiciary in usurping the legislation powers of the government.
A large part of the council's report was devoted to the Mex
can-American relations regarding workers. The report reiterated
its stand of last year at San Francisco and reported a number of
conferences held between Mexican representatives of labor and repre­
sentatives of the Amercan Federation of Labor. Representing Mex­
ican workers were: C. Loveira, Baltzar Pages, L. N. Morones, S.
Gonzalo Garca and Edmundo E. Martinez.

LIVERPOOL, Nov. 16.—Conscien­
tious objectors in Great Britain have
been subjected to unusual tortures for
their refusal to" drill, writes The Liv­

"Among "t'.e men brutally handled"
were Charles Dukes, former organ­
izer of the Gas Workers and General
Laborers' union* George Benson, who
had been associated with Norman An
gell in reform work George Beards

Stanley B. Boodle, a union man of
Lachtford Without.
Dukes, in a written statement, de­
scribes the tortures to which he wa»
subjected when he refused to drill.
He was placed in the guaTdhouse to­
gether with drunken men. He was
abused by petty officers, kicked and
cuffed and knocked senseless.
He was finally court-martialed and
sent to prison.
LONDON R. R. MEN
ON SABOTAGE STRIKE
LONDON, Nov. 16.—Railroad men
here have gone on a sabotage strike
and have effectively put at naught the
pernicious Defense of the Realm Act,
which prohibits strikes in time of
war. The road affected is the Great
Western Railway.
Finding that they could not strike
without' fear of punishment, the men
agreed to hold their jobs, draw their
pay and do as little work as possible.
There are. 2,000 men in the employ of
this company and the London Daily
Mail estimates that the men are not
doing 50 per cent of their normal
amount of work.
The Great Western Railway has put
an embargo on all perishable freight.
STEEL WORKERS WIN
THREE DAYS'STRIKE
JERSEY CITY, N. J., Nov. 17.—
^The "strike and win" slogan with
which 800 employes of the Crucible
Steel company walked out prevailed
against the corporation's efforts to
break the strike. In three days they
returned to work, having gained their
demand "for 10 per cent more wages
and the removal of an objectionable
foreman.
GUARDSMEN BACK
ON FAMILIAR JOB
ANDERSON, S. C., Nov. 16.—Two
companies of guardsmen arrived here
today and are expected to protect of­
ficers in serving writs of ejectment
against five families of striking cotton
mill employes living in cottages
owned by a mill company.
The mill workers struck when a de­
mand for ten per cent wage increase
was refused.

SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Nov. 16.—
Hofaer Waters, a colored strikebreak­
er, who on .June 18, the first day of

front, shot and "killed Thomas Olson,
a* striking' ntevedore, was- sentenced

San Quentin by_ Judge Parker, sitting
Judg* Dunn* /j
These meetings were held with thei
establishment of a Pan-American
Federation in view. The executive
council recommended that labor men
throughout the country, with the co­
operation of the labor press inform
the Mexican workers what Americans
have done through trade unionism
and recommends that the labor press
inform American workers of the Mex­
ican's struggle for liberty.
In reviewing the recent threatened
strike of the railroad brotherhoods,
the council reported that the railroad
chiefs were—in cpnstant consultation^
with members of the council and*
Samuel Gompers and that the prin­
ciple of arbitration was not rejected.
According to the report rendered
"They took the position that the
eight-hour day was a principle not
subject to arbitration. In this they
were in harmony with that demand
by all of the most ardent advocates
of arbitration, of conceding that there
are certain fundamental rights that
are not arbitraable or not justicable."
The report of the council also went
on record as being opposed to a cen»
sorship of the movies.
NEW YORK, Nov. 16.—The mes­
sengers boys employed by the tele­
graph companies and the messei%er
service of the city struck for more
pay and better regulation of work­
ing hours. After being on strike for
three days the companies were com­
pelled to make a settlement with the
boys. There were about 2,000 in­
volved in the strike. The boys had
formed a union and it was through
their representative and the state me­
diators that a settlement was finally
reached and they returned to work.
The new conditions follow:
Boys who formerly received less
than 2 cents per message shall re­
ceive 2 cents boys formerly receiving
2 cents will hereafter receive 2
cents a message errand service,
which formerly paid 10 cents, in the
future will pay 15 cents messengers
who work ten hours a day will get
an hour off for lunch messengers in
night service will get a day off every
second week. Mr. Skelton said the
increase in pay amounts to 25 per
cent.
THE RED FLEECE.
LONDON, Nov. 17.—It was
clear and cold and the stars
seemed very near, as if curious
about these men creatures below.
Soldiers of both armies were
sleeping and the only noise was
the tumbling of cannon In the
distance and the desultory firing
of nearby sharpshooters.
A voice rang out with a few
notes. The singer was a tenor
and he began "Mother McCree."
It floated thin and silvery on the
night air. The Irish regiment
stirred uneasily in its sleep.
A shot—a cough, and the voice
was stiUL
From across the trenches a
gutteral -voice called to the
sharpshooter. "Gott! Ton chut
ed him," followed by a string of
curses.
The singer was a Saxon named
Paul, who used to sing to both
armies in the night. The mur
derer was never found. This is
the story told by an English sol­
