PRESIDENT WILSON RE-ELECTED
Result So Close In Several States That Republi

Not Have Working Majority In House
of Representatives.
President, 1
WOODROW WILSON.
Vice President
THOMAS R. MARSHALL.
New York, Nov. 11. One the fnco of
the unoniclnl returns, tlio nbovo Is the
choice of the American peoplo for
chief executive oillcers of the nation
for the next four years, but the result
is so close In several states that llo
publlcun leaders pro not willing to ac
cept the verdict until a recount of the
ballots has been mndo In these states.'
The situation is extraordinary nml
lias resulted In days of nerve-racking
strain for the peoplo of the country.
If the election olllclnls of a few remote
precincts In n few states know how the
nation has been waiting breathless to
hear from them, they must be swelled
up enormously with a sense of their
importance. For on those few pre
cincts has depended the nation's choice
of its chief executive.
That Mr. Wilson's victory over Air.
Hughes will not he conceded without a
recount In the close states, such ns Cal
ifornia, New Hampshire, New Mexico
nnd North Dakota, was determined at
conferences of thu Itepubllean leaders
here. Chairman Wlllcox asserted n re-count
would be demanded wherever
the margin of Democratic victory was
so small that comparatively few votes
would turn tho scales. lie and his as
sociates say they take the position
that there should be no cloud upon Mr.
Wilson's title to the presidency. The
Democrats, for their part, declared
that theru must he n recount In New
Hampshire, even 'though the returns
gave the state to Mr. Wilson.
That the returns are still Incomplete
Is due to the presence, on the border of
the National Guard of u number of
states. The soldiers are permitted to
vote by mall, their ballots being for
warded to the auditors of their home
counties, and In Minnesota especially
tho oto of tho Guardsmen Is likely to
cut n llgure In determining whether tho
state goes Into tho Wilson or tho
Hughes column. v
Minnesota was as bad as California
in the matter of shifts, and ns its dele
gation Is nearly ns large, It, too, was
watched with the lntensest Interest.
Through days nnd nights of counting,
the race was a see-saw, with hut a
thousand or so of votes separating tho
candidates. Neither side would ad
mit defeat, nnd even now both are
awaiting the soldier vole and the olll
clal count.
New Hampshire a Surprise.
I'erhaps tho most surprising of nil
tho states was New Hampshire. It
alono of all New England failed to give
the lepubllenn candidate a substantial
plurality, and for days no one knew
in which column it would land. The
astonishing closeness of the vote was
shown by tho rival claims, three days
after thu election, of 100 plurality for
.Hughes and Si for Wilson. In tjie cir
cumstances it Is no wonder that the
managers of both parties should de
mand a recount.
New Mexico, with three electoral
votes, attracted national attention by
placing Itself early In the list of doubt
ful states, and as It soon appeared that
almost every electoral vote would be
vital, the returns from down on the
border were grabbed hot off the wires,
.After veering back and forth for days,
,Now Mexico was definitely placed In
tho Wilson column, though there, too,
'tho president's margin was so scant
that n basis was afforded for tho cull
for a recount. A few mistakes dis
covered in tho llgures of tho precinct
; olllclnls might well swing thu stuto
over to Hughes.
Wlllcox Demands Recount.
On Friday National Chnlrmnu Wlll
cox of tho Itepuhllcan party handed
out the following statement:
"Tho result still depend? upon the
vote In a few close states, it must bo
'borne In mind that tho returns thus
'far announced are, In most states, tin
official, and may be changed by tho
ofllctul count required by tho laws of
thoso states.
"Twice during theso unofllclnl com
putatlons yesterday in California mis-
takes In nddltlons were announced
from that stute, substantially changing
figures previously given
"It is a common experience that tho
result of the olllclal count almost ul
ways varies from tho returns flrbt an-nounccd.

reported in several states, it may well

old, was conveyed to tho polls here.
"Well, grandma, whom do-you want to
voto for?" Inquired tho election Judge,
who offered to nssist her In marking
her ballot. "Mr, Wilson, God bless
ldm," was tho reply.
bo that matcrl;ij Changes .will result
from the ofllclnl count".
"We owe It to the country to take
nil necessary steps to see thnt an ex
act nnd honest count of tho voto Is
made. When the current seemed to be
running against Mr. Wilson on Wednes
day tho Democratic managers an
nounced their intention to demand u
recount in every close state.
"All wo desire Is to make suro that
the voto Is counted ns cast."
Roth sides conceded that no matter
what action might bo tnken In regard
to n recount there, was little likelihood
of n contest being carried to the house
of representatives ns it-was after the
that as tho men voted In the suffrage
states, so did the women.
In Illinois men and women seemed
about equally divided as to prefer
ence. The slate went for Hughes by
a big plurality.
In Kansas, Colorado, Montana,
Washington, Oregon -'id California,
where woni"u also vo , Wilson was
successful, but his pluralities were not
sulllclently large to Indicate that the
woman voters supported him ns n unit.
Farm Vote the Factor.
There are several grent outstanding
facts concerning tho result of the elec
tion, ono of which Is that labor, In all
tho big Industrial states except Ohio,
declined to give Its undivided support
to President Wilson despite his claim
to It on tho scoro of having persuaded
congress to pnss tho Adamson "eight
hour" bill. New York. Pennsylvania,
Illinois,- MusiiuclinJotis, Michigan, In
dlnnn, all gave the Kepubllcan candi
date pluralities, nnd Ohio's vote In fa
vor of Wilson Is not certainly to be at
tributed to the labor vote.

How Congress Stands.
Congressional election returns, near
ly completed, nssuro President Wilson
In the forthcoming administration n
Democratic senate, but with five dis
tricts still undecided, the best that the
Democrats could claim was a plurality
of four votes in tho house.
Upon the basis of revised returns
the Democrats havo elected 215 mem
bers of the house and the Hi-publican's
'211. In addition there have been elect- j
ed ono Independent,- one Socialist, one
Progressive und one Progressive Pro
tectionist. Four districts In West Virginia, two
of them nominally Democratic, and two
Uopubllcan, nnd one 'district In New
Mexico, are still undecided. If these
districts do not change, the Democrats
will have 217 and the Republicans 211,
a plurality of only three.
As there will be four members of
other minority parties, a working ma
jority for the Dem 'ruts Is Improbable
unless some of the minority members
should choose to cast their lot with
the administration forces.
The senate, according to latest llg
ures, will consist of 51 Democrats and
12 Republicans, a majority of 12. The
Democratic majority in the present
sennto is 10.
An unusual feature of the result Is
tho election of tho tlrst woman to con

THE ELECTORAL VOTE
A $10,000 swindle was pulled off In
St. Joseph recently, the victim being
Boone Fnncber, a rich farmer, who
lives near Oregon, Mo. Nicholas J.
Glover of St. Joseph was later arrest
ed nt Princeton, Mo., nccused of be
ing ono of four men who worked tho
swindle, and was taken to St. Joseph.
Tho others aro still at large.
The swindle practiced on Fnnchcr
was the old horse raco "suro thing"
game.
Fancher had advertised his farm for
snle, and ho says the swindlers camo
to his houso to -get an option on it
for n rclntlvo In California. Several
days ago they returned and told him
tho money had been received from
California, but they had lost It in St.
Joseph betting on a horse raco in tho
Fast. They wormed themselves into
tho old man's confidence and by pro
tending they had a suro tip this time,
induced him lo get a draft for $5,000
on a St, Joseph bank to turn over
to them for betting.
Mr. Fancher bought the draft and
when ho presented it at tho German
American National Hank the olflecrs
tried to dlssuado him from drawing
tho cash, but ho had confidence in his
now friends and received the full
amount In $10 and $20 bills. When
this was lost, Fancher was yet credu
lous and he went to Oregon, procured
another draft for $5,000 and had it
cashed nt another bank there. When
