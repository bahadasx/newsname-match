INVESTMENT IN YAVAPAI COUNT!
E
PROPERTIES
EASTERN MILL 10
START IIP BEFORE

By WILLIAM P. De WOLF
PRESCOTT, Ariz., Nov. 14. Inter
est and investment in Yavapai county
copper properties, until recently large
ly confined to the Verde district, is ex
panding to other sections of this and
the adjoining county of Yuma. The
movement gained its initial momen
tum from copper ore discoveries of
more than ordinary importance made
some months ago in the Loma Prieta
mine in the Copper Basin section of
Yavapai county, and in the Harqua
Hala Bonanza mine in the Harqua
Hala section of Yuma county. There
is reason to believe that both of these
praperties will in due course become
regular producers of copper ore in
large, tonnage, and that each will be
instrumental in demonstrating the
copper-ore-bearing worth of the entire
district in which it is located.
Copper Basin Mines
The Commercial mine in Copper
Basin, owned by the Phelps-Dodge in
terests, is shipping from 80 to 100
tons of copper ore daily to smelter,
and could increase the daily tonnage
considerably were it not for the fact
that smelting facilities are not keep
ing pace with the output of Arizona's
mines, either in this or other mining
counties of the state. Adjoining the
Commercial mine is the property of
the Loma Prieta company, where a
body of ore having a general average
of 2 per cent copper is being de
veloped. A small tonnage of sorted
ore on the dump samples about 15 per
cent copper. The property is to be
equipped with a modern plant of ma
chinery and developed at depth. The
present depth of the shaft is 155 feet,
and it is in a solid body of chalcopy
rite ore from the 80-foot point down.
Copper Hill a Mine of Promise
The property of the" Copper Hill
company, a corporation dominated by
E. S. Clark and John J. Jackson of
Prescott, is another Copper Basin min
ing enterprise for which a highly pro
ductive future is predicted. Next to
the Commercial mine, the Copper Hill
has been developed to a greater extent

cial grade copper ore is exposed on
three levels and has been stoped to

ments of ore have been made at a
staff, McBride-McNulty and Lucky
Five.

excellent shape for future production,

sideration. Other properties in Cop
per Basin having a copper ore show
ing above average are the Shumate,
Schuber, John H. Robinson, Blicken
Harqua Hala Copper
Mineral conditions continue to im
prove as development work progresses
on the eighth level of the Harqua Hala
Bonanza mine, a Yuma county prop
erty in which H. William Stevens "and
other mining men of Prescott are
heavily interested. Hitherto worked

ore carrying high values in gold. This
ore body is standing the test of de-

appears probable the mine will in due
weeks ago on the eighth level in con-
velopment, both as to copper and gold
values, and is one of the most exten
sive ever opened in the mine.
Values Average High
The drift south on the eighth level
has been driven a lengtiv of 220 feet
in a continuous ore body. For a length
of 135 feet this ore body has
through the medium of crosscuts a
demonstrated width of from 14 to 16
feet. Sixty-five feet south of the first
crosscut and 100 feet south of a winze
that has been sunk in ore, the vein
samples an average of $28.80 gold
across a breadth of 14 feet A winze
has been sunk 12 feet at this point
the full width of the ore; that is, 14
feet The ore extracted from this
winze f is heavy with copper glance and
samples an average of $23.60 gold per
ton. A general sampling of the bot
tom of the winze gave an average re
turn of $44,00 gold per ton. The prop
erty is equipped with mine and mill
machinery and is now being equipped
with electric lighting facilities.
Venture Hill Annual Meeting
At the annual meeting of the Venture-
Hill company, held a few days
ago in this city, W. R. Uber, Ed Kiehl,
C. T. Jolly, Phil Pecharich and Ed
Shumate were elected directors for the
ensuing year. The officers for that
period will be: Ed Shumate of Pres
cott, president and treasurer; C. T.
Jolly of Clarksdale, vice president; W.
R. Uber of Los Angeles, secretary, and
Ed Kiehl of Prescott assistant secre
tary. The annual report of the com
pany, soon to be issued, vwill show the"
company to be sound financially, with
$14,000 cash and 437,000 shares of
stock in its treasury. The property
carries one of the best copper show
ings in the Verde district and is being
developed jointly with the Verde Apex
property under the supervision of
John S. Riley of United Verde Exten
sion (Little Daisy) fame.
Will Double Mine Corps
The operation being prosecuted in
conjunction with the Verde Apex com
pany are on a 50-50 expense sharing
basis. A force of 25 men is employed
in erecting camp buildings and in
grading a site for the joint three-com
partment shaft As soon as the cook
house and sleeping quarters are com
pleted the working force is to be dou
bled. The Venture Hill tunnel has
been driven to the line of the Verde
Apex ground and a crosscut is now
being driven from its face to the site
of the shaft This tunnel has a total
length of 600 feet and shows native
copper and copper sulphides in consid
erable tonnage. The plant of machin
ery, ordered jointly by the Venture
Hill and Verde Apex people, is en
route to the properties, and the cement
foundations on which it will be set
are nearing completion.
WILL SOON IKE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner)
S. R. Porter, manager of the Mur
dock and Oatman Southern Mining
companies, left last evening for the
northern part of California, where he
will remain for five days. Before
leaving Mr. Porter stated that he
would have an important announce
ment to mike regarding the Murdock
and Southern properties upon his re
turn. It is thought that this announce
ment will concern the early resump
tion of operations. The properties are
among tfieV'most promising in the
Black Rangesection of this camp and
the recent .showing at the Nellie and
Black Range have stimulated interest
in them as well as in all other nearby
estates.
NSTALLS NEAT OIL
F
(From Friday's Dally Miner.)
The Mohave Assay and Engineering
Office has installed one of the neatest
and at the same time most successful
oil flotation machines that the Miner
reporter has seen in the country. The
work of this machine is said to be
far cleaner than the old type.
Mr. Jacobson of the company has
been experimenting on ores from the
various sections of the Cerbat and
Wallapai mountain ranges and is get
ting excellent results.
Oil flotation is bound to be the suc
cessful treatment for the base ores of
the county, but it is the belief of the
Miner that the ores will have to be
tried out individually. Collective as
sortment of ores are sure to be found
"hard to handle, as each ore will re
am re a different gravity of oil or
treatment
J. F. Miller, owner of several min
ing claims in the Copperville section,
-which are now under bond to parties,
is in Kingman attending to business
Bryan Mensch is again about town
after being confined for a few days
to his room as a result of a fall and
injury while at work in the Ryan hotel
at Chloride recently. It will be a few
days more before he wilL be able to go
back to work.
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner)
That the United Eastern mill will
be producing bullion before the first
of the new year is now a foregone
conclusion. The immense building is
now almost completed. The roof is
on and the finishing touches are be
ing made. The last of the 17 large
redwood tanks are being placed and
the mills of various types are all in
place and being trued up. The neces
sary pipe work is being rushed to
completion.
All the big electric motors are in
place, and are being wired. The class
ifiers are in place and the elevators
are being erected. The large crush
ing plant has been completed for some
time and the conveyor is all but in
readiness for the start The machine
and blacksmith shops are complete and
are turning out equipment for the mill.
Several carloads of steel balls have
been delivered at the mill and will soon
be placed in the mills in readiness for
the start
The mine is in readiness to furnish
the ore when everything is complete
at the mill The new shaft is down to
the 600-foot point and a station, is
being cut When completed drifts will
be opened and made ready for opera
tions. When actual production at the
Eastern is a reality a wonderful' sys
tem of underground work will start
In stoping, the stopes will be filled
as fast as the ore is taken out Bare
ly enough room to accommodate two
or three men will be open at one time.
In this manner the entire orebody will
be taken out without danger of losing
any of the valuable ore or endanger
ing, to any extent, the lives of the
men employed. When a round of shots
is fired and the ore taken out the
next round of shots will be in the
waste which will fill the cavity. But
little or no timber will be necessary.
This will greatly reduce the tonnage
cost or production.
It has been estimated that the
United Eastern with its system of
mining and modern milling facilities
will handle the ore for less than $4
per ton. Should this prove correct
it will add much pay ore to the high
grade that is in sight. In calculat
ing the orebody at the Eastern no one
has estimated the $6 and $7 ore above
the upper levels.
NIGHT HAWK MINE
LEASERS RECEIVE
RETURNS ON ORE
Returns from a recent shipment of
ore from the Night Hawk mine was
received a few days ago by Frank
Ferraris and others interested in the
lease on that rich old property. The
ore gave a net return of $500 per ton
in gold and silver. Itt. Ferraris has
gone back to the property and expects
soon to have another shipment of the
same grade ofore.
The Night Hawk was one of the old
shippers of the county, producing
largely high grade ore. Some of the
handsomest and richest specimens of
ruby silver ore ever found were taken
from it in early days. These speci
mens also ran high in gold, the aver
age being about $240 a ton. Four
teen tons of ore shipped from the mine
by the late George M. Bowers netted
$19,500. Leasers shipped many car
loads, but on effort was ever made
to equip the mine and sink to a new
level. All the development work was
done through tunnels, the longest be
ing 1400 feet With proper equipment
the mine would be a big winner.

ERSON MINE IS
BEING GLEANED 00T
(From Chloride Sertion Dally Miner)
The Emerson mine is still being
cleaned out and prospected. The 108-
foot winze from the tunnel level has
been put in shape and sampled. The
values are said to have been quite satisfactory.
The vein was wider than expected.
During the year in which the old
working had been unused, the talc,
which was thought to be the footwall,
slacked and caved, exposing to the
present owners an additional three
feet of good-looking ore. This makes
the vein about ten feet wide at that
point
An old shaft, 400 feet distant on
the same vein, has also been cleaned
out and will be sunk 50 feet deeper.
This shaft may be utilized as a main
working shaft when real mining is in
full swing.
II ON SPECIAL NUMBER OF
MOHAVE COUNTY MINER BEGUN
The work of the county road build
ers on Tennessee avenue is making a
vast improvement in that thorough
fare. Already it has been completely
rebuilt more than half the distance
from the railroad near the Tennessee
mine to its intersection with Second
street Enough boulders were taken
out at one place to make a stone
fence two feet in height and 50 feet
in length. This stone was utilized by
a nearby property owner for that pur
pose.
OF GAMP
VISITING NEEDLES
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner)
One of the largest aggregations of
boosters ever assembled in one party
in Mohave county was that which left
Oatman at 1 o'clock yesterday after
noon for Needles where they will be
the guests of honor of the Chamber
of Commerce of that town until noon
today.
Every available private and rent
auto was put into service for the oc
casion, and even then there were not
accomodations enough for all who
wished to make the trip, in response
to an invitation from the California
town. The invitation was personally
delivered by E. N. Baker, secretary
of the Needles body.
Among those who made the trip
were Fred Young, Ed C. Jacobs, W. F.
Gray, T. E. Fisher, A. G. Keating, E.
T. Eisen, E. K. McPherson, Paul
Geory, Mitchell Carter, H. C. Topp,
Ed Haff, A. C. Colwell, H. C. Snow,
J. R. Gold'sworthy, H. C. Newell, R. T.
Watson, L. L. Wallace, V. S. Rowley,
Frank Strong, Sam Bayless and J. A.
Small. They represent all lines of
business of the district
RICH SPECIMEN FROM
SILVER RILL MINE
(From Chloride Section Dally Miner)
A specimen weighing 475 pounds
was taken from the north shaft of the
Silver Hill last Saturday and placed
'on a platform prepared for it in front
of Fridley's hardware store in Chlor
ide. It is all ore and has seams of
almost pure metal, several inches in
width, cutting through it in several
places.
A stone-boat and team of strong
horses were requisitioned to haul it
from the hill to its present location.
In size it is small, but the specific
gravity of its contents make it hug
the earth in a surprising manner.
OFTI
ORE OPENED UP IN
(From Friday' Dally Miner.)
J. F. Miller, who came to Kingman
yesterday from the Yucca tungsten
field, reports that he and associates
have opened up a body of ore ap
proximating $49,000 in value in one
of the claims. The property is ex
plored by drifts, crosscuts and raises.
The vein is four feet in width and
carries about six per cent tungsten
and some values in gold. The owners
purpose the installation of a small
milling plant to work the ores, putting
a large plant when the property
has been developed to an extent to
justify it
Mr. Miller is the owner of the prop
erties adjoining the Deluge Wash
molybdenite mines, which he has
optioned to J. L. Boyle and associates
of Los Angeles. These properties are
being worked and molybdenite con
centrates are being shipped from them
to the company's works at Los An
geles, where the concentrates are re
duced to ferro-molybdenum. The en
tire product is said to have been con
tracted for by the Braun company.
. Work has already begun on the de
luxe edition of Mohave County Miner.
G. B. Lindsley, a specialist in such
work, who will personally prepare and
edit the big magazine supplement, is
in town and working on the prelimin
ary matter, planning the art designs,
and getting a line on the county, its
citizens, resources and attractions.
Within the next few days he will
start on a systematic campaign of
sightseeing and information gathering
auto trip and before he is through will
visit every section of the county and
secure data and photographs that will
be needed. Pictures of mines, ranches,
roads and scenic beauties will be
turned over to Jack Box, the famous
New York cartoonist, facial delineator;
and illustrator, who will make suitable
layouts for photograph and pen and
ink etching of the more prominent
citizens. Mr. Box has just finished a
striking illustration for the cover page
that appeals in all ways and takes one
back to the days of yore with the
halo of romance, during the Indian
days and those of early prospectors.
The cover also includes photographs,
artistically embellished, of mines,
ranches, cities and scenes.
The entire edition will be printed
on fine magazine paper with an
elaborate cover in color. Nearly one
half of the space of the "wonder
edition" will be half tone reproduc
tions of pitctures of mines, cattle
ranches, cities and scenes of the
county. It also will include interest
ing writings, descriptive of the
county's history, resources, climate,
scenery, romances, religions, politics
and people in general as well as in
dividually in a word, it will deal, in
its entirity with the past, present and
future, covering all their phases.
We are for Mohave County "The
Mineral Kingdom'.
AT
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner)
A carload of supplies for the Old-
trails Exploration company has ar
rived in Kingman. It includes rails,
fish plates, spikes, car, blacksmith
outfit, etc., for use at the Crystal
Springs claims of the company, where
a tunnel is being driven under the
direction of Max Brown. The tunnel,
it is calculated, will cut a 50-foot ledge
at a depth of 350 feet
Manager Brown says the ledge is
a strong one and gives surface assays
considerably higher than the average
in the Oatman district The ledge
strikes directly east from the Goldroad
mine. The tunnel site is about 5,500
feet northerly from the Tom Reed
mine. The company has a well
equipped camp and is developing its
claims with one shift of miners at
present
DIAMOND DRILL TO BE
OPERATED AT MOSS MINE
From Oatman Section Dally Ulnar.
A diamond drill was delivered at the
Moss mine Wednesday afternoon and
the first hole will be started soon.
The hole will be bored on the vein to a
depth of 500 feet, after which a sec
ond hole will be sent down to one side
of the vein at a sufficient distance to
tap the supposed orebody at a depth
of 1500 feet The machine will take
out an inch and a half core at the
rate of 25 feet per day.
TO INSTALL- MACHINERY
(From Thursday Dally Miner.)
John H. Conway and associates are
getting ready to install a plant of
machinery on the Heidenrich property
in the Wallapai mountains. Work is
progressing on the adit drift but it is
found that shaft sinking will be neces
sary to further exploit the property,
especially at the point where the best
ore showing has been found.
STOCKHOLDERS OF UNITED
EASTERN HOLD MEETING
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner.)
The annual meeting of the stock
holders of the United Eastern Mining
company was held at the office of the

OF BLACK RANGE ORE
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner)
Mitchell Carter, secretary of the
Black Range Mining company, has
adopted an advertising scheme that is
unique in Mohave county. He has se
cured 5000 small sample sacks and
has printed thereon "Sample, of ore
from the Black Range." Into these
sacks he is placing small samples of,
ore from the property and each day
a large number of them are leaving
through the mail for various parts of
the country. - .
Enough ore is contained in eaca
sack for an assay, and it is the hope
of Mr. Carter and his company that
all who receive samples will havatheja
assayed. The idea is original witMMri
