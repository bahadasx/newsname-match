RIGiUlHYSICAL
EXAMINATION HARMFUL
Vs.- f
Statement Made by Switchman to the
- Board of Arbitration.
New York. Nov. 17. Rigorous ohv-
sical examination which switchmen
employed by the Chicago. Rock Isl
and and Pacific Railroad have to pass
every two years In order to keep their
positions do not bring improvement
to the service, In the opinion of Dan
lei G. Smith, a switchman on that
road, who testified late today before
the board of arbitration in the contro
versy between thirteen railroads and
the switchmen's union.
Under - the old - school, before the
railroads had physical examinations,
they were run better than they are
now," he said. "Now they will throw
a man out because he cannot read fine
print. The company loses its beet
men sometimes because they cannot
fulfill the requirements of the physi
cal test."
Henry Polhamus. vard conductor at
Buffalo, asserted the men there had
received a voluntary wage increase of
one cent an hour in 1913. but that the
Increase was not noticed owing to th,
high cost of living. He said the pres
ent wage demand was made on March
17 last and added:
"At that time we asked for 47 anA
50 cents an hour. But if we were
making the demand now, considering
the way everything has Increased in
cost, I think 70 and 75 cents an hour
would be nearer right."

THE MORE PUBLICITY, THE BETTER IS JBUSINESS
Publicity is one of the things which every business house, every
merchant and every corporation Is coming;, to realize that cannot be
neglected. ,,
"Advertise and the unscrupulous vote-attracting attacks of poli
ticians on corporations will stop" says a public accountant in close
touch with financial affairs of corporations and governments.
Another supporter of advertising In addressing the American Elec
tric Railway Association said: "In the past the affairs of most of the
utility companies were known- only to the officials in charge and compre
hensive reports were seldom published. That day ts past, however,
and at the present time those who direct" the' policies of the industry
have come to realize that the more publicity they can give tiie better
it is for their business."
There can be no question in this day and generation that adver
tising is necessary to every line of business if it is going to set prop
erly before the people and grow. In this part of Connecticut there is
no advertising medium that equals The Bulletin' because it circulates
thoroughly. It should therefore be used to get the trading opportuni
ties before the people.

SELF-GOVERNMENT IS
GIVEN POLISH JEWS
Order Issued by Governor-General of
Russian Poland.
Berlin, Nov. 17. (By Wireless to
Sayville). General Von Benseler, governor-general
of Russian Poland, has
issued an order at Warsaw in regard
to the organization of a Jewish relig
ious body in Poland, by which self
government is given to the Polish
Jews.
"Under Russian rule the Jews In
Poland, as In . all Russia, lived almost
Without a religious organization,"
says the Overseas News Agency in de
scribing the new order. ''The hostil
ity of the Russians against the Jews
found expression In well known laws
and in uninterrupted persecutions and
oppression of the Jewish community,
as well as in the fact that a religious
body to which 14 per cent, of the pop
ulation of Poland belongs, was de
prived of all uniform organization.
Only the formation of' organizations
of isolated parishes was allowed and
the union of parishesr Into a larger
organization was forbidden.
"By the ipresent order of the governor-general
the members of the
Jewish church are re-organized as a
religious body according to public
right. Local Jewish communities in
the counties, according to the . new
order, are united to county organiza
tions. The heads of these county or
ganizations 1 are administrative coun
cils which, are made up from the
boards of the smaller communities
and selected according to the princi
ples of proportional representation.
"The administrative council will be"
composed of eleven members, of whom
three must be rabbis. At the head
of the Jewish religious body will be
a supreme Jewish council, provision
ally composed according to propor
tional representation. The supreme
council, according to the order, has
21 members, of whom fourteen must
be laymen and seven rabbis."

New London, Conn., Nov. 17. The
collision which caused the merchant
submarine Deutschland to abandon
her return voyage to Germany almost
at its outset eariy today, when the
convoying tug, T. A. Scott, Jr., was
sunk with a crew of five men, was the
subject of federal investigation this
afternoon.

marine, slipping out of the harbor in
the darkness so that she might sub
merge in neutral waters before day
break, ran down, the tug which was
acting as her protector, off Race
Rock, just outside this port.
Testimony Given in Secret.
This testimony cams from Captain
Paul Koenig of the Deutschland, from
F. W. Krapohl, his chief officer, and
frrs Hans K!ee;:e, his chief engineer.
It was given in secret, But it became
known through statements outsije
the chambers that the collision was an
accident. Survivors who would dis
cuss the matter were agreed that it
was due to a combination of swift
currents which carried the tug off Its
course and across the bow of the
submarine- and o darkness. which

for tho lof:s of thn Scott .and it;
crew, they will hear the testimony of
Captain Frederick Hinsch, an official
of the Kfstern ' Forwarding company,
who was the only survivor on the tug.
Hinsch was thrown from the deck
house of the tug, on which he was
standing, into the rusnfng water of
the Riic. whore he was rescued, al
most eruKpd, by the crew of the
tug Cassie. following behind. Hinsch
was unconscious after the accident
and ton?xit was still so exhausted
that it was said it might be several
days before he was able to testify.
Captain Harry Baker of the Cassie
and some of his crew a'so will ba
called to tell their observations.
Will Be Delayed Only a Few Days.
The Deutschland's return will be
delayed only a . few days, estimated
variously from, two trays to a week,
by the damages which she sustain
ed and not at al! by the fact that in
quiry is being, made. Examination of
her bow toda showed that three

others as a "dent." Her sicm was

OPPOSED .TO SALE OF
DANI8H WE3T INDIES
Former Governor General Examined
by Parliamentary Committee.
Copenhagen, Nov. 6. (Correspond
ence of The Associated Press). For
mer Governor-general of the Danish
West Indies, Helweg Larsen, was ex
amined today by the parliamentary
committee and opposed the sale of the
islands. The present bad 'conditions,
according to the retiring governor, are
mainly due to the labor question and
the policy of the Danes in treating
the negroes in the same way as white
people.
If the islands were sold to the Unit
ed States they would have the Ameri
can tariff, according to the ex-governor
and that would virtually kill the
trade of the free port of St. Thomas.
He advocated the retention of Danish
sovereignty on the general ground
that the islands are very Important
for Danish commerce and shipping.
Chaplain BJnar Oisen of St. Croix,
speaking before the committee, main
tained . that the negroes would be
much happles under American rule.
He described the Intellectual advance
of the American negroes as very Im
portant and thought those of the Dan
ish Islands would share the same con
ditions tinder American administra
tion. NO MISTAKES FOUND

that his testimony may go far to- i

Tokio, Oct. 21. (Correspondence of

patches from Changohun, Manchuria,
say that 200 persons were killed or
wounded by the explosion of a muni
tions train on tho Russian railroad at
Chnuchiasui station, near Tsitsihar, In

sisted of forty freight cars, two of
which were loaded with mines which
had been manufactured in Japan for
the Russian army. .- 1
The accident is believed to have)
been due to an overheated wheel axle
which caused the ignition of one of ;
the mines. The whole train exploded '
and many persons who were standing

were killed. Others were burned in j
