PISGAH NATIONAL
FORESTNOWFEDERAL
GAME PRESERVE.
Washington, Noveaibet :— Presi
dent Wilson has issued a procla
uiatlon by which the Pisgah Na
tional Forest, in western North
Carolina, is made a Federal game
preserve, This is the lit si Fed
eral game preserve of its kiml to
be created east of the Mississippi
River.
The Pisgah National Forest
consists largely of the George W.
Vunderbill estate, part of which
has been purchased by the Gov
eminent. The land is located
near Asheville and Biltmnre, N
(J. Owing fo the protection
against hunting which has been
afforded the tract for a number of
years, the game has not been kill
ed out, as is the cas»' in most
places, in I lit' southern mountains.
Deer, wild turkey, and pheasants
are said to be pb'ntiful.
After it was known that the
tract would be acquired by the
Government, many of the local
citizens urged that the protection
to the game should be continued.
The North Carolina Legislature
passed an act whereby the State
consented to the enactment by
Congress of laws for the protec
tion of game, birds and fish on
any lands purchased by the Gov
eminent under the Weeks Law in
the western part of the State.

Never bel or»< has th»'re been a

As tin' ri»'e crop removal was
Sp'lling toward its close, th*' sugar
liai vest, was inaugurated shonly
altert lit> rnnhll»' of October, and
reports received by Moiieru Farm,
ing from various parts of the so
gin belt ar«< uniformly favorable.
Th»' tonnage of th»' stubble or s«<e
oml year cane, always the first
cane to be cut for the mill, is turn
ing out, bett«>r than expected, and
there are high hopes for large re
tu 'is from the plant cane of first
year crop. From the crop removal
and manufacturing viewpoints,
(here is nothing to be desir*>d, for
Hi«' weather has piovi'ii admirable
fort h** opening of tin' campaign,
being the sort that is calculated
t»» "pm plenty of sugar in the
cane." We learn of sugar yields
per ton of cane being found dis
tiuetly higher than usual at the
outset of sugar making, in fact,
tIn* mills securing the latter days
of October as much sugar per ton
of cane as is ordinarily obtained at
tlo> clos»* of the season, win'll tin»
cane is normally sweeter. Hhnuld
there lie the usual augmentation
in saccharine percentage of the
cane juice during the next four to
six w«'eks of the grinding season,
we can expect some exceptional
factory results this season.
No one will be found willing to
d»>riy the sugar man his inning, for
he Indeed lias had a long wait for
crop and maikct conditions ns fa
vorable as they are now. Should
prices hold as high during Novem
b«*r and December as they were in
October, or even approximatly so,
at anuind the six cents mark, the
Louisiana sugar industry will en
ter tii«' new year hi a wonderfully
prosperous condition. Practically
every cane planter and sugar
manufacturer, thanks to good
yields and prices, can be expected
to work clean from under the bur
den of »lebt that has sorely press
ed him for some years past,.
Aside from the worhi's deficit in
sugar, ereated by the war, the rea
sou for the market having strength
died last month and holding so
firm, I« the car shortage situation,
which is sorely hampering the
'marketing of (he big United tttates
beet sugar crop, the largest on
record It had been feared in
Louisiana sugar circles that when
the beet crop began to move dur
ing October, prices would quickly
fall. Here is where the car situa
tion at least is proviug of local
hcnclU. It is estimated that the
Louisiana Hiigar crop this year
should produce not less than 250,
000 long tons of sugar, against
which the 1915 production was
123.000 long tons.
Louisiana's other principal crop,
corn, while slightly smaller in out
turn than last year, placed at 44,.
600.000 bushels, against 45,100,
000 bushels in 1915, Is yet worth
more money thanks to higher val
ues, and our planters and farmers
are cashing in nicely on that
which they are willing to sell.
From the above, and knowing
that greater quantities of food
aud feed crops were raised on
Louisiana farms this year than
usual, likewise that our farmers
have registered encouraging ad
vance in live stock husbandry, it
is clearly evident that the various
farmiug interests in Louisiana
have never been in better finan
cial shape than they now find
themselves. All of this means, in
conjunction with farm loans easier
to make than in the past, that we
are due to see much advancement
in farming pursuits and improve
ment of farms wrought withiu the
coming year.—Modern Farming.
