WASHINGTON D. C., Nov. 18.?
There will be no further Investigation
of alleged election frauds in West Virginia
by the Department of Justice, dc
atoite t!> * recent statements of Attorney
General Gregory that there would
lie. No formal official announcement
thait the investigation has l>een called |
off in West Virginia has been made,
nnr k mir> liVclv In lu? Vi-vftl't hclfiss. '
tliu so-cullou investigation in that slulol
is definitely oft.
The foregoing statement is made on I
the blgbost authority, coming from u 1
men who is in intimate touch with at-;
fairs in thut department, and tvbose
particular duties connect him with any
investigations which nre ordered by
the Department of Justice.
Why the investigators have been
railed oft in West Virginia is a mat- j
lor of surmise, but West Virginians
conversant wuu wie political situation
in their stale will not be mystified by
it. It is guessed here that National
Committeeman Watson has Interposed
and put a stop to it. On ibe other hand.
.Senator Chlllou is said to be demanding
it- In this conflict, state politl^/jans
here pretend to see an effort oa
r u part of t>eIla,"r Chilton to ornbar,
J'rJs National Coinaiitteenian Watson.
L./ is suspected with very good roason
, that the latter does not want the elec-:
lion returns iu Marion and adjoining!
counties stirred up. lie prefers to let
them remain as they are. Friends of
Senator Chilton here who intimate'
that their favorite was given a raw
deal by Watson, declare that they j
would like to see the election in Ma-!
rlon rountv tinencd no and conn into '
with an lionest purpose to see that jus-1
tice is clone, noboilv who is hurt there-1
by. The Chilton people here talk like |
tltoy want revenge and reprisal.
Marlon county is tint the only bad i
mess in the northern end of the state '
it all reports are even halfway true.!
Barbour and adjoining counties in the ;
Watson zone of political influence are'
nald to have been scenes of wholesale |
election corruption from which Democratic
candidates were the beucfleiarles.
However, there will be no probe of
elections in atarion or any oilier counties
In the Watson group by the Do
partment of Justice. Solicitor General
John W. Davis, who is connected with
that Department, is supposed to have .
Informed his chief. Jlr. Gregory, of
the exact condition of tho election
aftermath in West Virginia.

give It to her Just as I'd hand my little

USE NEW ILLS
Two Will Re P nnnecteii
Soon?Eight Are Being
Drilled.
Two wells, capable of supplying
1.500.00U cubic feet of gas per clay, will
be turned into tbe city mains of the
Monongnhcla Valley Traction company
in two weolts, or as soon as pipe
for a short eonnectlnit link, arrives
and can be placed. The flow front
these two wells will maintain the pressure
In the city through practically any
emergency liable to arise. The wells
are located at I'lum Run and Uinga
mon.
The gas department of the traction
company is now at work drilling eight
new wells, from which a considerable
reseryc is expected to be drawn. These
new wells are the Toothmun. Keener.
Pitzer. Jones. Hawkins. Leonard,
Shriver, and one other farm located in
Lincoln and Mannington districts.
Considerable difficulty in securing
contractors to do the drilling has been
experienced by the traction company
In the past few months, their wcIIr
having been held up a certain extent
for that reason. Well drilling material
Is now much In demand and is hard
to secure on short order.
The difficulty in securing pipe is ali
that has prevented the traction company
from having the two wells already
drilled in, turned Into the roaiuH
of the city. The order for the pipe has
now been placed however, and the
connection will be in place shortly.
