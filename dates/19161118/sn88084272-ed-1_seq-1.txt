Pontiac. ni, Nov. 18. The grave of
Christine Uiemer was opened today and
the body of the girl taken from it in an
endeavor to clear the names of her
father, mother and sister who recently
were held to the grand Jury ln connec

It is hoped bv the members of the
Seimer family that a more thorough
examination of the body will 'develop
evidence to support the theory that the
ifirl drowned herself in the river near
here during a spell of insanity. The
coroner's Jurj held that the absence of

body pointed to murder. The body was
found a week ago after members of the
