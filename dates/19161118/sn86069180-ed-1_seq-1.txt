THE CIVIC ORDER TOMORROW
With clergy from all parts of the
country In attendance, a five-day
celebration of the 700th anni
versary of the founding of tho
Dominican order of tho Catholic
church was begun at tho Dominican
.-House of Studies, Brookland, D. C,
Tuesday morning.
The ceremonies opened with the
celebration of Pontifical high mass,
celebrated by Cardinal Gibbons in
tho chaDel. Tho sermon was
Dreached by Mgr. Thomas Shahan,
rector of the Catholic University of
America, in the course of which he
praised tho Dominicans for tho high
order of their work during the
seven centuries.
Except for a meeting to be held
ut Poll's Theater on Thursday after
noon at 3:30 o'clock to which the
general public was invited, tho cele
bration was wholly ecclesiastical,
consisting of mass every morning at
the Dominican College.
Before mass Tuesday morning,
which began at 10 o'clock, there
was a procession of those partici
pating in the celebration. It
marched out the front door of the
college, across the front lawa and
Into the chapel by the side door.
The Dominican priests, in their
robes of white, led tho procession,
followed in turn by the Franciscan
fathers and the secular priests.
Mgr. Shahan reviewed the history
of tho Catholic church and the
Dominican order, describing tho dif
ficulties under which tho early
members of tho order worked. Un
ler tho protection of tho Holy See,
he said, the order became tho eyes,
oars and voice of tho Catholic
-church in Southern France, and
the order has worked constantly
and efficiently during all these years
directing men along tho lines of
oigher. life.
The Dominicans, ho continued,
tiave always been loaders, even, in
theology, which they have made a
science, and their contributions to
the architectural and artistic world
are well known.
Ho offered the Dominicans the
congratulations of tho Catholic Uni
versity of America on this tho 700th
anniversary of tho birth of the
order. The Dominican order, ho
went on, has been a glorious pro
cession of architects and artists,
und nowhere could be found a bet
ter, more able or more learned body
than tho followers of St. Dominic.
Tho scene in the chapel was an
impressive one. Tho Cardinals and
Bishops in their robes of red were
on either side of tho altar, tho Do
minicans in their white robes on
either side of the aisle, and tho Sis
ters, in black, in tho rear. Tho
building was draped on the outside
with tho national colors,
Wednesday was "University day,"
Mgr. John Bonzano, tho Apostolic
Delegate, celebrating Pontifical
Tiigh mass and Peter Guilday, Ph.
D., professor of church history of
tho Catholic University, preaching
tho sermon.
Tho students' celebration occu

theological disputation was held.

Va., being defendant of tho thesis
and Rov. John Welsh, of Chester,
Pa., the objector. A dissertation

OAPT. SOIIAN DEAD.
Capt. Joseph M. Sohan, who
served with distinction In the old
Louisville Legion, died early Mon
day morning at Sts. Mary and
Elizabeth Hospital, following a two
weeks' illness of Brlght's disease.
He was fifty-seven years old and
had lived in this city all of his life.
Formerly Capt. Sohan was connect
ed with his father in the firm of
Sohan & Sons, manufacturers. He
attained the rank of Major in the
Legion and was widely known and
ecteemed. Capt. Sohan made his
home with hie brother; George M.
Sohan, 726 South Sixth street, and'
a regular communicant ai tne
Cathedral, where the funeral -was
held Wednesday morning. The pall

GREAT IRISH BAZAR.
Treasurer Thomas Hughes Kelly
reports a profit of $45,000 from tho
great Irish relief fund bazar at
Madison Square Garden, New York
City, which ended on October 26.
More than 4,000 workers united
actively to bring about this gratify
ing result, about three-fourths of
these being of Irish blood and the
others largely-of Gorman extraction.'
Considering the adverse conditions
which 'confronted tho committee It
conservatively may be said that the
bazar was a most noteworthy suc
cess from the moral as well as the
financial standpoint. Tho excel
lence of the exhibits, the tone of
the entertainment, tho high charac
ter of the entire enterprise reflected
great credit upon all . who partici
pated so actively in it. Probably
the greatest success from the point
of view of tho Board of Directors
is the propagandist work for tho
patriotic, intellectual and industrial
movements in Ireland. Treasurer
Kelly was able to report that the
general fund, which he has actually
received from various parts of this
country, including tho bazar profits,
now amounts to $183,000. - There
have been collected In various lo
calities throughout the country at
least $50,000 additional which has
not yet been forwarded to him. The
Treasurer reported further that he
had already sent to Ireland tho sum
of $80,000.
CIIAPIjAIX'S TRIBUTE.
There is no doubt that, from a
Catholic point of view, the border
duty has done much to broaden
tho minds of many toward, the
church. The Catholic chaplain of
a Massachusetts reglnlent reports
tho following incident:
"While talking recently with a
chaplain from Pennsylvania wbo
had occasion to take a furlough of
thirty days to straighten out some
church, mat'ers in his parish, he
said to me, 'Father, I have never
in my life wished that I was a
Catholic priest until now.' I asked
why such a statement and ho said,
'I feel that the only man who can
do any good in the army Is the
Catholic priest. This morning,' he
continued, 'while I only had one
hundred men at my service, tho
Catholics were on their knees by
the thousand close by, and nothing
Impressed me more than the piety
and devotion manifested. I had to
go home because some few of my
parish had criticized me for going
with the troops, as they thought-it
unnecessary, but if over tho pres
ence of a minister was needed, it is
hero among so many men away
from the influence of home. Be
sides,' he said, 'it has opened my
eyes to the patriotism of tho Cath
olics. I came hero narrow, and I
must v confess bigoted, but after
what I have seen from you Cath
olics I have become as broad as the
Atlantic ocean, and I take off my
hat to you. I am,' said he, 'a mem
ber of all tho patriotic organiza
tions in my town, organizations
whose members aro always preach
ing Americanism and patriotism,
yet out of all these we got only
six recruits. I told my congrega
tion two Sundays ago tho sight I
saw on Sunday in your camp, how
thousands of Catholics knelt on the
ground at your services bareheaded;
I told them about the chapel you
had in tho camp, and how service
was held every morning and at
tended by a goodly number of the
officers and men, and then when I
thought of myself and other Prot
estant chaplains like me who could
muster only a few hundred to wor
ship I feel as if my office ns a
chaplain amounted to nothing. You
are blessed,' he continued, 'because
you have a Colonel and officers who
give the example to tho men, but
wo have no encouragement from
our officers.' He further stated
that 'when he went homo he would
have more respect for the Catholics
and that nobody could question
their patriotism or loyalty In bis
presence.' "

A. P. A.
Cowardly Forces Lead Attack
on the Sisters of Charity
at Washington.
Object to Their Employment as
Nurses in Soldiers'
Home.
Military Institution Governed
by Itulcs of United States
Arm j'.
SIGNAL TRIBUTE TO THE SISTERS
Tho fact that Sisters of Charity
are employed as nurses in tho
Soldiers' Homo In Washington,
p. C, has led to an attack of the
A. P. A. forces on tho management
of that institution. .Jt has been
represented by tho bigots that the
home has "fallen into the hands of
the Roman Catholics," with the re
sult that Protestant inmates aro
neglected, if not actually ill-treated.
Tho National Tribune of Wash
ington, in an editorial appearing in
a recent issue, shows the utter
falsity and absurdity of these
charges, and explains the reason
for the employment of religious
nurses in the institution a reason
that is a signal tribute to the self
sacrificing devotedness of our Cath
olic Sisterhoods. The editor of the
National Tribune writes:
"There has been so much distor
tion, exaggeration and misrepre
sentation In regard to the Soldiers'
Home at Washington, D. C, that a
rather extended statement seems
necessary.
"In the first place, different from
all other soldiers' homes, that at
Washington is not a Government in
stitution, but belongs to the soldiers
of the regular army. Tho Govern
ment makes no appropriation for its
support and maintenance. It is
bultt and is maintained by contri
butions from men in the regular
army.
"The Soldiers' Home is the result
of the effort of tho higher officers
of tho army for many years to es
tablish an institution where the dis
abled and invalid soldiers could be
supported.
"The specific charges that are
made and widely circulated all over
tho country are that the home Is in
tho hands of the Roman Catholics,
who control everything, to the
prejudice of the .Protestants. It is
asserted that the adherents of that
church have taken complete control
of the home; that none but Cath
olics can get any favors; that the
mail is controlled by Catholics, who
embarrass the deliver' of papers
and other literature to the Inmates,
especially of the hospital; that
those who take anti-Catholic period
icals aro marked for disfavor; that
the surgeon in charge of the hos
pital is a Catholic; that employes
of the home are refused appoint
ments and opportunities for extra
favors unless thoy are of that
church; that priests and nuns are
quartered in the building to the
exclusion of veteran inmates; that
Catholic services prevail in the
chapel to tho prejudice of Prot
estant services; that tho nursing Is
done by Catholic Sisters, who show
favors to the Catholics and dis
favors to the Protestants, etc.
"The plain truth is the home Is
a strictly military institution gov
erned by the rules and regulations
of the United States army, which
knows no political party, no race,
nor sectarian, denominations.
"It is managed very much aa a
camp or garrison is, with justice
and impartiality to all and no
favors to any. Tho men are old
regulars, and through force of habit
If nothing else the rules and habits
of a garrison dominate everywhere.
"There is no question raised as
to a man's nativity, politics, race
or relielou. any more than there Is

REPUBLICANS
"Will Now See Real Party Fight
Between Roosevelt and
Johnson.
German-American, Catholicaml
Labor Vote Myth Dead
Forever.
What Has Become of A. T. llert,
Champion Prcdictcr of
Campaign?
G. 0. P. WORKERS POORLY PAID
The next battle to be fought in
the political arena is to be for con
trol of the Republican party and the
contestants aro to bo Hiram John
son, of California, and Theodore
Roosevelt, of,.Oyster Bay. The odds
will b'e oh Johnson because of the
tact that the old Republican leaders
like Barnes and Penrose will lino
up with tho new leader In prefer
ence to their permanent enemy,
Roosevelt. Another element sure
to back Johnson to pretty near a
man aro the Progressive voters who
have turned their back on Roose
velt for his traitorous desertion, and
this support behind Johnson will
carry the deciding strength. Pro
gressives throughout tho United
States were pulling for Johnson to
a man in tho recent election and
his big vote in California showed
that he was equally popular at
home. Johnson has issued a state
ment since the election blaming
Major Gen. Otis, of the Los Angeles
Times, the bitter opponent of union
labor, for being leader of tho Re
publican faction that drove tho Pro
gressives away from Hughes. Other
leaders gavo their view of the Cali
fornia result, but tho one not yet
Issued is that of tho Rough Rider,
and when it comes you will read a
Btzzling roast of Johnson by Roose
velt, the latter to claim that John
Bon men knifed Hughes, not that
Te'Hdy cared for that, but he hopes
to hurt Johnson with tho G. O. P.
leaders and moneyed men.
It was repeatedly asserted in
these columns that some of the cam
paign chairmen were pursuing a
will o the wisp when they spoke
of corralling tho labor vote, the
Catholic vote, the German-American
vote, the Irish-American vote, etc.,
and the results demonstrate that
voters as a whole do not vote In
bulk according to their race, relig
ion or occupation. In tho big cities
like Chicago, Now York and Phila
delphia Wilson did not even get his
share of the union labor vote de
gplte the appeals of Sam Gompers
and other would-bo labor leaders,
who profess to deliver something in
every election that they haven't got,
the nation-wide summary by the
New York Times-carrying the same
report from every 'section, and that
was tho union labor vote did not
rally to Wilson. The same applied
to the German-American vote, they
voting according to their party prin
ciples. In Milwaukee, where the
German-Americans predominate,
Wilson carried the city by over
7,000. In Hoboken, where there
aro more Germans in proportion
than Milwaukee, -Wilson carried tho
city despite the fact that tho Re
publican leaders had flooded tho
town with appeals- to the German
voters to vote aaglnst Wilson. In
Maryland, where the German-American
vote is estimated at 40,000,
Wilson received 134,216, with a
plurality of 20,521.
As for tho so-cauea uatnouc voie,
the results in tho -Western States
will convince one that the Catholics
weren't voting as a political unit
against Wilson. In 1912 the com
bined Republican-Progressive vote
showed a plurality of 13,000 over
Wilson. This year Wilson's plur
ality is 27,336. The Government
religious census shows that 73 per
cent, of Montana church going peo
ple aro Roman Catholics. In New
Mexico the Taft-Roosevelt vote com
bined in 1913 exceeded Wilson's by
6.000. This year Wilson carries
the State by 3,000. Of the church
going people Catholics comprise
88.7 per cent, in Now Mexico. In
Nevada tho Taft-Roosevelt vote ex
ceeded Wilson's in 1912 by 1,000.
This time Wilson carries tho State
by 2,606. Of the church going
people in Nevada the Catholics com
prise 66.7 per cent. Practically the
fiamo result is shown In Arizona,
where the Catholics comprise 66.2
per cent. In California, which is In
the limelight very much just now
and considered by many tho decid
ing State, hero are the figures: The
combined Taft-Roosevelt vote in
1912 was 287,524, giving a plurality
over Wilson of 4,088. This year
unofficially Wilson receives a plur
ality of 3,278. Of the religious de
nominations in California Catholics,
according to tho last Government
census, comprise 68 per cent.( the
next two being Methodists with
-..,6 per cent, and Presbyterians
with 6.2 per cent. All of this shows
that tho Catholic voto supposed to
have been corralled against Wilson
was a bugaboo, Just as were tho
labor and German-American votes.
Many anxious voters have been
looking in the Louisville Herald for
an after-election statement of
National Republican Committeeman
A. T. Hert, the new Republican
Moses in this section, who was the
Chairman of tho entire West, and
who gavo out dally Interviews of
how the South and West were going
for Hughes, and asked everyone to
be sure and stick a pin In his pre
diction, especially in regard to Ken
tucky, his homo State. Instead of
sticking the pin in his prediction
many voters stuck the pin in his
election bubblo and with the burst
ing of that bubblo It is rumored
that away went tho promise of Am
bassadorship to the Court of St.
James in London, this being the
prize Mr. Hert was working for.
This will bring Mr. Hert back to
local politics again, and this has set
the Axton men to worrying, as they
probably figure that Hert, if not
wanting to run for Mayor himself,
will want to pick one of tho old
guard Republicans, and Axton does
not como In that list. Hert's de
cision In that matter will be final,
as tho Chilton-Searcy machino will
abide by that decision because of
tne campaign barrel that Millionaire
Hert would probably donate or
raise. Tho local Republican dic
tators can't afford to take any
chances as there Is a long winter
ahead with few of their brethren In
tho Postofflce and Custom House to
kick in for next year, as they had
fondly hoped in the event of
Hughes' election.
Along this line it Is charged that
many of the Republican ward' work
ers are disgruntled over the small
pittance received election day, some
of them exhibiting checks for $1.25
for their day's work, which is
hardly enough to fill the bottom of
the old dinner pall tho G. O. P.
used to talk about. On the other
hand some of tho friends of the
machine leaders say that you. could
hardly blame tho money handlers
for following out the old adage, "A
bird in the hand Is worth two in
tho bush." Here is a pretty good
problem for tho next Republican
class that gathers over there on
Walnut street. If $40,000 is allotted
to Kentucky and the greater propor
tion of that to Louisville, how much
Is left over after paying tho work
ers ?1.25 each? This little problem
Bhould show some mighty apt pupils
and wo will agree to publish the
winning answers free of charge.
Many are wondering If Marshall
Bullitt, Joe Conkllng, Henry Fox
and others who put In a hard day's
work at the polls received those
checks for $1.25, the latter sum be
ing hardly enough to pay for the
pie and good things that Mr. Bullitt
put away at his station In the Ninth
ward. Anyway many a valiant Re
publican worker will not be on the
firing line next year, some because
of the small check for services ren
dered, while others can't see why
they should bo expected to use a lot
of their energy and time for Axton,
a loser of four years ago, and just
as in the fields of sport they know
a loser can't come back.

CAUSES SERIOUS ALARM.
Commenting upon the recent ap
pointments for Ireland, the Irish
Catholic says it is to bo hoped that
Lieut. Gen. Bryan Mahon, lately
i.nmm.nnHir of tho British forces on
the Western frontier In Egypt, and
now appointed to succeea juajor
Gen. Sir John Maxwell as com
mander of tho British forces in
Ireland, will use his extensive pow
ers with the utmost wiBdom and
discretion. Tho times require this,
for in addition to tho political trou
bles which are agitating tho country
and which call ror a speeuy ana
just settlement, tho enormously
high price of foodstuffs Is every
where causing the most serious
alarm. The Irish potato crop, it
has also been reported, has been at
tacked with another blight which
may cause a great deal of suffering
amd misery.
IRELAND
Sir Edward Carson to Make a
More Active Campaign For

DESTROYS HUMANE THOUGHTS
From Larne, Ireland, tho Irish
Press and News Service receives In
telligence from J. H. Donnelly that
throughout tho Nationalist and
Orantrn sections nf itm WnrtVi
sldo of Belfast recruiting figures
for both classes aro being closely
scrutinized by the active agents of
Elr Edward Carson, who intends to
make a more active campaign for
conscription at the opening "of tho
year. So far an I cjin innm h
canvass will show that for every
nvo or bIx Unionists sent to tho
front only one Nationalist has gone.
Much feeling has beon engendered
Dy ine stuay oi tne recruiting lists.
Unionists and loyalists declare thoy
Will not anneal to thnlr foltmrnro
any longer.
A stranger in Ireland must exer
cise great caution In meeting per
sons. Espionage is severo and all
American visitors aro tracked and
closely watched. Your occupation
must bo proven or you will be de
ported. No tourists are wanted or
welcome and tho resorts havo badly
suffered. So many have been pro
secuted under the defense of tho
realm act that tho war is discussed
In whispers and when a stranger
approaches tho group will break
up.
High food cost and tho scarcity
of good food Is tho talk and worry
of all tho poor people. Tho prices
are about the same as in America,
but wages are scarcely half what
they are in Now York or Chicago.
A four-pound loaf of bread costs
twenty-two cents. Tea, tho favorito
drink in tho Irish homo, costs
sixty cents a pound. Good woolen
garments aro scarce.
In some of tho small towns,
where nearly every person Is a
Sinn Felner or an advanced Na
tionalist, the returned soldier has
a hard time of It. No ono dares to
employ him. Ho was a hero early
In tio war; now ho is charged with
betraying Ireland for tho benefit
of England. The London Post has
Bent correspondents to tho towns
affected and guarantees the exist
ence of the unhappy conditions de
scribed. I have oven seen crippled
soldiers refused hospitality among
a people usually kind and gonorous.
Tho war has destroyed, for tho tlmo
being at least, many humane
thoughts.
Every section of Ireland is
roused by tho Portobello execu
tions of the pacifist Skeffington and
tho shooting of tho boy Coade. This
cruel murder of four men and a
boy has done moro to shock the
sense of justice in Ireland than
the execution of Sir Roger Case
ment. The officers of tho Royal
Iilsh Rifles aro notoriously cruel to
prisoners and tho attempt to clear
Capt. Colthurst on tho ground of
insanity Is regarded as a white
wash. Dickson and Mclntyro, tho
other two editors killed by order
of tho samo forces, took no part in
tho revolution.
John Redmond's address at
Waterford Is curiously regarded in
Ulster. His denial of favoring
partition does not agree with tho
fact and he has been condemned
at many Ulster Nationalist meet
ings. On the other hand ho is
given credit for heading off con
scription, which Is dreaded moro
than any other proposition. I
passed Redmond at a railway sta
tion in tho West. He bears evi
dence of great anxiety and appears -s
before tho Irish public but rarely.
So far as I can learn ho is not
making any personal appeal for
recruits.
SACRED HEART.
The Sacred Heart church congre
gation was glad to welcome back
last Sunday tho pastor, Rev, Patrick
Walsh, who had been on a vacation
for the first tlmo in many years.
Father Walsh visited In tho East
and California, where ho was both
pleased and surprised with what he
saw and tho progress of the pebple
everywhere. But after all, ho said,
that whllo the West was a great
nnd glorious country, tho Sacred
Heart parish was still tho spot he
loved best and ho was glad to be
home. Father Walsh enjoyed his
trip, a fact borne out by his robust
and splendid appearance.
