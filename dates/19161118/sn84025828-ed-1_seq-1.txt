PUBLIC UTILITY COM

ULATE SURFACE
LINES
Tho. recent decision of tho Illinois
Supremo Court In the Chicago nnd
West Town Railway Company enso 1ms
au Important beariug, attorneys say,
on a enso Involving tho power of tho
Illinois Public Utilities Commission to
regulato surfaco lines in Chicago.
In th'o West Town's decision tho
court held tho commission had no
power to compol the company to ro
turn to rntes In effect July 1, 1913,
unless It found those rates to bo rea
sonable and the present rates to bo
unreasonable.
In tho caso Involving control of tho
Chicago surfaco lines by tho commis
sion, tho commission nttompted by or
der to compol tho surface lines to put

sought to enforco other regulations
for rcllof of congestion. Tho Cook
County Circuit Court restrained en
forcement of tho commission's ordor
on tho ground that tho commission
had no jurisdiction over street rail
way lines. Tills was bnscd on a sec
tion of the state constitution limiting
tho powers of tho legislature.
Upon tills point, In tho West Town
Hallway Company case, the court said
In part:
"Tho public utilities act docs not
vlolato Bcction 4, articlo 11 of our con
stitution. That section docs not, by
Implication or otherwise, attempt to
divest the stato of its paramount au
thority nnd control of tho streets nnd
highways. It is equally clear that tlint
section of tho constitution docs not
doprivo tho legislature of tho powers
to fix rates for such complaints."

TAXED TO DEATH
People of Chicago Taxed to the

GROCERS CORNER
CHICAGO FOOD
Aldorman Willis O. Nnnco, chair
man of tho council health commlttco,
started on a hot scent on tho trail of
an nllogcd combination ot retail gro
cers. It leads, ho declared, to a boy
cott conspiracy botweon certain
groups ot grocers and wholosalo deal
ers to forco all retailors to soil tholr
products nt a cortnln prlco or bo ro
fused subsequent purchases from
wholesalers.
"Tho Information I havo comos from
unlmpeachablo authority," said Alder
man Nance, "but it Is impossibio to
mako known tho dealers' nanio Just
at this tlmo, ns It might block tho
Inquiry tho committer is about to
launch into tho operations ot alleged
illegal combinations of retail grocors.
"Tho grocer who hns complained to
mo states that ho was forced to ralso
tho prlco ot his bread from 5 to C
cents nnd from 8 to 10 conts as tho
rosult of tho concorted action of a
group ot other denlors, who Informed
tho bakery company from which ho
was purchasing his bread that thoy
would placo no moro orders with It
unless it mndo this dealer 'como to
tlmo' and boost his own prices.
"This grocer who has como to mo
says that ho refused to comply with
his rivals' demands nnd that tho
bakery then refused to sell him bread,
as hnd been threatened, nnd refused
to tnko back tho stnlo loaves that ho
had loft on his hands. Frightened
by tho success of tho move against
him, ho raised his prices to conform
with tho demands. Tho bakery then
resumed Its deliveries and business
again rolled along in its normal chan
nels. "I havo received othor tips of tills
character, and this commlttco Is go
ing to try to lay wldo tho heart of
this alleged conspiracy, nnd if found
substantiated by tho facts, as I ho
llo vo it will, wo will lay tho ovldenco
beforo tho stato's grand Jury or fed
ornl government for prosecution."
Alderman Gcorgo Pretzel of tho
Chicago's
same commlttco laid plans for tho
furthoranco ot his investigation Into
tho question of an alleged "egg cor
nor" In Chicago, and will put what
Information ho obtains Into tho hands
of tho commlttco nt its noxt mooting,

THOSE CEMENT
RIVER DOCKS
Tho city council harbors commlttoo
postponod action on tho proposed or
dinance requiring docks along tho
river nnd Inko front to bo built of
concreto Instead ot wood. Ropresonta
tlvos of tho Chicago River Improve

ponement. Thoy told tho commlttoo
that passago ot tho proposod moasuro
would practically moan tho confisca
tion of cortaln rlvor front proporty.
TAXES STILLJOING UP
Taxes nrc still going up, nnd thcro
Is no relief in sight.
Chicago will bo compcllod to spend
an estimated $5,000,000 moro to con
duct tho various departments of tho
city government during tho year 1917
than In 1910.
These nrc the npproxlmnte figures
now In tho hands of City Comptroller
Hugcno It. Pike. Thoy were furnished
by tho heads of the various depart
ments to bo Included In tho annual
budget. Work on tho latter Is now
progressing by tho city comptroller's
staff, and is to bo turned over to tho
council commlttco within a fow weeks.
Thcso figures do not include the
cost of operating tho public school
system, the public library and tho In
terest on tho city's Indebtedness. Ap
propriations for thoso branches of tho
city government nro mado scpnrntoly.
When tho nguro3 nro presented to
tho council finance commlttco much
slashing Is expected, nnd this will be
followed by protests from tho depart
ment heads. Mr. Pike said ho was un
able to estimato nt this time Just how
much of the oxtrn $3,000,000 would bo
permitted to stnnd.
For tho yenr 1910 tho amount of tho
corporate fund of tho city as provided
In tho budget wns $31,S 17,797. 10. Tak

nmount tho sum of $29,8II,C1G.15 ro
mnlncd. About tho city hall It was dcclnrcd
that tho big Incrcaso In tho various
department estimates wns duo Inrgcly
to tho high cost of living. Tho high
price of print paper, It was declarod,
also would flguro prominently In tho
estimates for olllco supplies In nil de

ted ho had understood that many of

Ono of tho big Increases Is oxpoctod
to be in tho flro department, whoro

that Chief Honloy will nsk for an In

LEGISLATURE
LOOKS GOOD
Clifford W. Barnos, prosldont ot tho
Leglslatlvo Votors' Leuguo, predicts
n great Improvement In tho noxt son
oral assembly. In a statement issued
Mr. nnrnes mnkos tho following oh
sorvntlons; "Tho Leglslatlvo Votors' Loaguo bo
lloves Illinois citlzons havo a right to
expect that tho session of tho flftloth
gonornl nssombly shall bo ono of pur
poso and accomplishment.
"Tho porsonnol of both tho sonata
nnd houso, as disclosed by tho olectlon
roturus, Is fnr bottor than usual. Tho
fact that tho same political party that
controls the executive department of
government nlso hns a majority In tho
legislative body should mako for n
harmonious program of constructive
legislation in tho next general assem
bly. "For years thcro hns been n crying
need for tho institution of business
elllcloncy in Illinois governmental af
fairs. Tho mnkcup ot tho present
legislature should almost bo a guaran
tee to tho people that thoy may expect
relief In this direction.
"Tho last legislature Instituted sev
eral reforms Hint greatly Increased
assembly elllcloncy. Tho cutting down
of the number ot standing committees
In both houso and sennto was n niovo
In tho right direction.
"Tho perfection of tho house rules
so that n constitutional majority of
that body was nt all times complcto
master of Its proceedings nnd tho lop
ping off of useless housu pay roll
places under tho direction of Spenkor
Shanahnn wcro commendable. It is
to bo hoped further work along this
lino will bo done by tho now assembly,
nnd that tho sennto pny roll prodigal
ity of 1015 will bo replaced by tho
houso economy practices.
"Altogether thu league believes Illi
nois need have no reason to bo
ashamed of Its new leglBlaturo. Ot
tho twenty-live sunntors-clcrt twonty
ono wero men either recommended or
found acceptable by the league, and
lL'O of tho 153 members of the house,
according to tho lenguo's findings, nro
men who should prove ncceptnblo as
lawmakers.
"No assembly of recent years lias
been composed of n greutor number
of legislative veterans. In all It ap
pears that nine senators and ninety
houso members havo been ro-clected.
Klght other Bonators-olect havo had
exporlonco ns former members ot tho
senate or houso. This loaves only
eight members of tho uppor body with
out somo leglslatlvo experience.
"In the hniiHO, In addition to tho
ro-olectod mombors, thero will bo olght
others who have seen sonata or houso
servlco In tho post. This leaves a
totnl of only llfty-flvo leprosentntlvos
