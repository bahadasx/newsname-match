N. 0. Farm and Stock Show
Most Wonderful Fair that Exceeds any Similar Sight in
This Part of the Country--Exhibits from
Louisiana and Other States
The National Farm and Live we
Stock Show which began in the inj
city of New Orleans last Satur- mi
day was a revelation and a sur- pe
prise to the thousands of visitors bil
who were so fortunate as to at.' ei
tend this wonderful Fair. The mi
free entertainment features alone se
are worth much more than price P1
of admission to the grounds. The al
fair is well balanced and beauti- f
ful in all of its departments, and ca
carries an immense amount of m
valuabe instruction. Well in - lx
formed exhibitors and citizens F.
who have taken in the fa:rs of or
other States were free in express- ar
ing the opinion that it is the F'
most wonderful exhibit they
have ever seen in the south. a'
Hundreds of cattle, horses,
mules, hogs, poultry, dogs, etc., d
of almost every known brecd S
were there. Motors, automobiles
and trucks of all kinds, machines
and patent inventions for the
home and farm, and displays of
merchandise of rare quality are
arranged in bewildering profu
aion. Agricultural exhibits from
many parishes, Bs well as from
State of Mississippi, are
shown. ool, hospital and
home furnishin i . endless va
riety, industrial work by blind t
operators, as well as exhibits of
work by school children, and
many booths fitted out by the b
great stores and manufacturing
establishments of the city are to t
be seen on every hand.
The crowning glory of the fair
was its immense magnificient
floral exhibit, that could not be
surpassed in any country. The
flower show is said to surpass
anything ever seen in the city.
It is a revel of beauty by day and
a wonder by night. In this de
partment, as well as in other de
partments, the handiwork of
women is shown in hundreds of
ways. In fact, time and space
will not suffice for us to tell of
the many attractions of the fair,
which is to be made an annual
institution in the city. All we
can say is that it will be worth
the time and expense of any and
all who can afford to attend this
fair.
The opening of the fair was
preceeded by a big parade on St.
Charles and Canal Streets that
A.....- Th tr Ta N h No . . ..

was a novelty, and most interest
ing. It is said to have been two
miles in length, and had 2000
persons and about 400 automo
bile conveyances in line. Six or
eight bands headed the various
military, civic and mechanical
sections of the parade. Governor
Pleasant and many officials from
all over the State attended the
f a i r. The biggest delegation
canme from Shreveport. The
mayor of New Orleans and 120
boosters attended the Shreveport
Fair, and Shreveport went them
one better by sending their mayor
and 125 boosters to the National
Farm and Live Stock Show.
