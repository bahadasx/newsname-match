WIFE BEATER8 OF
DRY OLD KANSAS
A Kansas town Ij ccitlna up a pil
lory for wlfe-bcr.tcrc. What are tho
statistics concerning wlfc-bcatlng In
tho Prohibition ctatss, nnyhow?
13 there any connection between
the habit of not drlnklny, and tho
habit of wife beatlno? We know of
no other ctato In which wife-beating
Is so prevn'ent that resort must be
held to the pillory to discourage It.
Is prohibition worth tho pr.'ca if It
leads to wlfe-beatin(j7 And Just why
when tho psychic stimulant Induced
by alcohol Is removed, should n man
turn to vIfc-ceatlng? Is there also
a psychic stimulation In wi'c-bcat-Inn?
Wo don't know anything about It,
wo only Inquire. It ceems to us to
bo one of those cases calling for a
thorough Investigation by psycholo
gists, physical cclentlsts, sociolo
gical experts, and n hook contain
ing two hundrod tr.b'es and a thou
cand pages. Such a bcol: is a ter
rible thing to contemplate, hut

'" A TOAST TO VICTORY

Here are French artillery men In camp, clicking their vlno glasses In
honor of their past and future successes In battering German defenso
works.
Tho Houston Post editorially tsakca
fun of the Colorado brand of prohibi
tion, saying:
Colorado is a prohibition ctate. Pro
cuniably it is tho ono and only dyod
In tho wool prohibition stato of them
all. Tor in Colorado, when tho antia
found that prohibition va3 going to
carry In spito of all their ofort3 they
decided to mal:o tho prohibitory laws
so stringent and to enforco thorn oo
thoroughly that Colorado would ho
glad to re cater tho wot column at tho ,
nct e'ection.
Go Colorrdo ha3 the stringent laws.
Colcrado has tho thorough enforce
ment. Or at least Colorado peoplo
thought tho laws woro enlorcod. May
be Ihoy are, but Judge for joursolf.
In prohibition Domor tho majority
of liquor shipments ara to women
They drive :y to tho freight depots in
drnya e.nd load In tho beer and vhis
koy cases by tho wholesale. Ouo wom
an received dIx barroln of bcor In this
manner and sho said slio was going
to drink it horself. Another woman
received ton gallons of whiskey and
still anothor Got niuety-cK pints of
wh'sl oy. All of thorn must drink this
stuff themselves or violato tho law
Tho fieicht peoplo cstlmato the
amount of Leer rccoivod in Denver nt
ICO barrels onih day. Whiskey goo
thcro in quantities equally imposing
Ono chirment of a solid carload oi
liquors went to Lcadillo lnat month
to bo uinj by ono Individual, and
neither to bo cold or given away. The
law la strict on thoso points and the
law is bciiift enforced. So say the
peoplo of Colorado.
Ono curious thing about those
liquors ia thoy go to a dry ttate, ant
many of them go from a dry stato.
Kansas is dry. In fact It la very dry.
It ia co dry that it ia tho prido of
oory prohibition orator In tho coun
try. Dut n coed many of tho liquor
shipments Into Colorado aro from Kan
sas. Thoro Is a good deal of food for re
flection In all this. There Is much for
tho prohIbItioul3ta to explain. And
then again, thone conditions In Colo
rado explain como things. To a cer
tain oxtont they oxplaln why, with a
larger per cont of territory dry than
In any other year, tho Unltod States
used 10,000,000 gallons of whisky moro
in 1915 than In any precedlns year.
