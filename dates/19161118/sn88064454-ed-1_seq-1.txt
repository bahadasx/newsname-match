Bishop Laval of New i1 rleans
gave the Holy Sacramennt of ('on
firiuntion ihere Sunday to a class
of over six hundred children.
Due to it being four years that
the Holy Sacrament was not given
in St. Martinville, the class was
extra large.
The ceremony took place at 2:30
o'clock in the evening, opening by
a procession from the Presbytery
to the Church, headed by the
Bishop. A sermon was made be.
fore administering the Holy Sacira
ment to the children.
A large number of people from
the country and town attended the
impressive ceremony.
Clean Bad Skin From Within
Pimply, muddy, complexions are due
to impurities in the blood. Clear up
the skin by taking Dr. King's New Life
Pills. Their mild laxative qualities re
move the poleons from the system and
brighten the eye. A full, free, non-grip
long bowel movement in the morning is
the reward of a dose of Dr. King's New
Life Pills the night before. At your

Foot Ball.
The St. Martinville High School
foot ball team was defeated here
Sunday in a very slow game, due to
the absence of . Bienvenu at cen
ter. which greatly handicapped the
local boys.
The score was New Iberia 38.
St. Martinville 0.
The feature of the game was the
offensive work of Brigant and Kock
of New Iberia and of Fouraet and
Goulas of St. Martinville.
The St. Martinville boys are go
ing to, Abbeville today to play the
team of that town.
Stop The First Cold
A cold does not get well of itself. The
r process of wearing out a cold wears you
out. and your cough becomes serious if
neglected. Hallcking coughs drain the
energy and sad the vitality. For 47
years the happy combination of sooth
ing antleseptic balsams in Dr. King's
New Discovery has healed coughs and
relieved congestion. Young and old can
testify to th, effectiveness of Dr. King's
New Discovery for coughs and colds.
