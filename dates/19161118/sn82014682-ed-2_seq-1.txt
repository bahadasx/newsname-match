WASHINGTON, D. C Nov. 18. The
president has appointed Lieut.-Col.
, Francis E. Lacey of the 32ndt Infantry,

Col. Lacey will report to the com

as assistant to the chief of staff.
C. S. ALBERT.
Capt Henry C. Merriam is of the
Coast Artillery branch of the service
and Is now at Fort Baker, Cal. There
was some speculation after the cable
gram to the Star-Bulletin was known
this morning whether Henry M. Mer
riam, who married a Honolulu girl.
Alls8 Lishman, might not be the offl
cer designated as assistant to Col.
Lacey, but Henry M. Merriam has re
cently, been, promoted from captain to
fiiajorand. abo recently went.to.Fort
Worden, Wasftlngton. so that another
transfer now is not Hkely.V
This news, received today by special
cable from Washington, will be of in
terest to army folk on the island, as
the appointment of & chief-of-staff in
the Hawaiian Department has been
the cause of considerable speculation
for many months. '
The feeling has been expressed that
It would probably be some time be
fore the appointment was made owing
to.the fact that such officers as could
be released from present duties were
needed on the border. '
No officer has held the position here
under the title of chief-of-staff since
MaJ. A. S. Conklin left the department
for dutjr on the -Atlantic coast. MaJ.
Conklin was followed by MaJ. Michael
J. 1-enihan, promoted 'to. lieutenant
colonel during his time here, and who
held the position of acting chief-of-v
staff. .

BIO CHANGES IN
TAX LAWS UNDER
IN NOW
Territorial Commission Is Con
sidering Plans That May
Be Proposed
TALK OF ABOLISHING
TITLE OF P0LL TAX
Suggestions Will Probably Be
Put to Public in formal
Notice
Itadical c hanges in the tax system
of the Territory of Hawaii are under
consideration by the territorial tax
commission, it was learned today, and
though no definite suggestions will be
proposed to legislators until after a
careful studv on the matter, several
plans which have come up for consid
eration are getting the careful study
of the commisisoners.
Whatever changes are to be pro
posed to the coming legislature will
not be given until the plans have been
given out in a formal manner for the
people, so that any objections to cer
tain of them can be brought before
the commission in meeting. y
One of the plans proposed for
consideration by the tax commission
is that now used in Massachusetts of
taxing the money deposited in savings
banks, the tax being paid by the banks
themselves and being at a low rate.
The suggestion has been made that
the commission take over practically
the sam law in this regard as the
Bay State uses and apply it to Hawaii
Poll Tax Changes
Another proposal, and what is said
to meet with considerable favor, is the
abolishment of the poll tax of $1 a
person and changing it to a road tax.
At present, besides the $1 poll tax,
there is a school tax of $2 and a $2
road tax.
If the proposed ")l&n should go
through, it would mean a road tax of
$3 and a school tax of $2. It Is pointed
out that while there would be certain
advantages to this, it would be a hard
ship on sparsely settled communities
which must, depend for their, road
money on the distributive poll tax.
Still another suggestion that has
been made to the commission and one
vitally important to corporations is
that corporation taxes shall be assum
ed by companies having Interest in
them. This would be done by striking
out a portion of Section 1241, which
eays, "There shall be deducted there
from the value of shares held in other
Hawaiian corporations."
It was pointed out today by one of
the commissioners that there exists a
certain corporation in these islands
valued at $4,000,000, but which pays to
Hawaii through its taxes only $2600,
which sum is for office furniture and
such tangible assets. The rest is paid
on investments on the mainland. If
the taxes were to be assumed by the
companies holding shares in the cor
poration it would come to fill the ter
ritorial coffers instead of those of a
mainland office.
It Is understood that plans for
changing the method of taxing auto
mobiles so that horsepower or gas
consumption instead of weight shall
be used as a basis are also proposed. ;
FILED IN H
SITE LITIGATION
No jur- will be needed to determ
ine the owners of that portion of the
Irwin site now In contest, those per
sons whose claims are net contested
and those whose claims are contested
having filed in federal court today a
stipulation waiving a jury hearing.
This leaves the matter to be heard
before Federal Judge Charles F; Cje
mons. . .
The W. G. Irwin Estate Co., which
is contesting the claims of a dozen
purported owners of property, has
filed in federal court a bill of particu
lars setting forth in detail its claims
to that portion of the site under con
test, and their origin. The bill esti
mates the contested portion to be
worth $171,500.

BULLETIN
( Associated Prr by FdraT WifpUnV
PRINCETON, N. Jv Nov.. 13. Yale
continued the Blue's string c'f victories
this afternoon when it scored 10 points
on the Tigers, and held the Nassau
team safe all the way.
Harry Legore, the big Yale half back,
came into prominence when he hurled
his way through the line for a touch
down. Comerford, the right end,
kicked the goal. Braden added the
other three points for the Hilo eleven
when he kicked a field goal.
The game was played before the
largest crowd that has ever witnessed
a game at Princeton, and th play
proved exciting throughout, though
Princeton's failure to score was a Dis
appointment. In the first two periods the teams
failed to take advantage of opportu
nities, and although each had an op
portunity to kick field goals in the
first half of the game, all were missed.
Yale showed a hard punch in the lat
ter part of the same, and Legore's run
ning featured the offense.

SENATOR PHELAN
TO MAKE REPORT
TO THE PRESIDENT
Ca'ifornian Smilingly Admits
He Has "Many Things" to
Tell Chief Executive
REFUSES TO MAKE ANY
DEFINITE STATEMENTS
Manner Would Indicate What
He Reports Will Not Hurt
; - Present Officials
When United States Sen.itor James
J). Phelan of California was about to
board the Great Northern this morn
ing for the return trip to the co;ist he
made no definite proraises concerning
his recommendations to the president
relative to the administration of Ha
waii's government, but he admitted
he hud considerable information to re
port to Mr. Wilson, and his general
manner indicated his reports will be
favorable.
The senator was loaded to the ears
with Ieis and surrounded by frienas as
he made his way through the crowd
! to the steamer's side, not a moment
too soon. He was about the last pas
senger to climb the gang-plank and
to the last two reporters were at his
side, and may it be s;iid that they both
received his attention even in those
last hurried moments.
When asked if he had made a state
ment to a prominent official here that
he would udvlse, the president to con
tinue the present "governmental in
cumbents, including the governor, in
office here he reiorted with mock se
verity:. "How dare you place such words In
my mouth, sir? I never said anything
of the kind."
He did not deny, however, that such
might be the nature of his report.
Senator Phelan has ben a recogniz
ed adviser of the president on several
important afaifrs, Including the Santo
Domingo affair and it is generally un
derstood that his rerommendations to
the president on important appoint
ments bear considerable weight.
"Will you report generally on what
you have found and seen in Hawaii?"
was fired at the statesman.
"There are a few things I think I
shall tell the president," he replied,
with a grim smile.
A happy "aloha' was his last word
as he scrambled up the gang-plank. .
No attempt was made by the lecal
Democratic party to Influence Senator
Phelan in any recommendations he
may make regarding Hawaii, says
Prof. W. A. Bryan, chairman of the
territorial central committee.
"So far as I am aware there was no
effort of this kind," Bryan says; "The
party had but a very little time to
even entertain him. His address at
Aala park was a very clear one on
the administration and its policies. He
left; with the local party the general
impression that the administration is
being run along lines of the type of
progress the party stands for and will
always stand for."

TERS, Nov. 17. Western w-ar arena.
Crown Prince Rupprecht's front: On
both banks of the Somme temporarily
today there was a very heavy artil
lery duel. About evening English at
tacks were launched near Beaucourt,
but the attacks failed, as well as a
right attack later, west of Lesars. A
regiment of guard grenadiers on the
road from Fleurs to Thilloy cleaned
out an English nest and captured five
machine guns.
A French advance on both sides of
the Sailly-Sallisel line brought no ad
vantage to the aggressors. Flyers
were active day and night.
East front: Prince Leopold's army:
Fighting between the Haltie and tli
Carpathian mountains was insignifi
cant today. On Archduke Carl's front
in the Carpathians the Russians
tenaciously resist our attacks.
Bavarian Infantry Reserve Regiment
19, which had previously often given
proofs of its valor, captured at the
point of the bayonet the summit cf
Runcul mountain and maintained it
against strong attacks. West of Pre

broke a Rumanian position. As a re
sult of yesterday's fighting we ca;
tured 10 officers and more than 13m
men here and elsewhere on the front,
besides 12 machine guns.
The troops report that the Ruman

In the course of a forceful political
address at Aala Park Friday night Sen
ator James D. Phelan of California,
replying to a suggestion by Democratic
leaders, declared he would be the god
father in the United States senate for
the Bourbon party in Hawaii.
Senator Phelan's address was deliv

He touched on Hawaii only in a gen

fortunate in being a part of the Unit
ted States. Regarding conditions In
the Philippines he pointed out that,
while the government is outside of the
self-government, there was a question
in the minds of the leaders whether
the Filipinos really desire such inde
pendence. He argued that, under self- ,
government, there undoubtedly would t
be trouble in the raising of means to
retain their independence.
