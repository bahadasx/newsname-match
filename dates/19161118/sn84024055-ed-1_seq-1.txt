As further proof that the short
sighted leaders of the Republican Party
did not want much to do with the Col
ored people in a business way for they
entertained the foolish idea that all
the Colored people would be compelled
to vote for Hughes and Fairbanks just
the same, for the Natioual Committee
in New York City appropriated one
hundred thousand dollars for the for
eign language weekly newspapers but
it would not expend one dollar with
the Colored newspapers throughout the
country. For more than two weeks
before the late presidential election
came to a close the Republican Nation
al Committee spent many hundred
thousands of dollars for full or double
page advertisements in both the Demo
cratic and the Republican daily news
papers in Chicago and in all the other
large centers of population; but at the
same time the Colored newspapers and
most of the White weekly newspapers
were spat upon, ignored and their edi
tors treated with the greatest contempt
and spurned aside, without receiving
the slightest consideration whatever in
the way of advertising.
The Republican state committee of
Illinois followed in the footsteps of the
Republican national committee in this
Mime respect and for more than one
week- before November 7th it ran full
or double page advertisements in all
the Republican and Democratic daily
newspapers in this city, but at the
same time completely ignoring tho Col
ored newspapers eemingly there was
a feeling on the part of its head mem
bers that Colored editors can easily
exist on Republican wind and cold
soup tnat colored editors should reel
liighly honored in being permitted to
run several pages of plnte matter each
week free of charge.
At this time all that we can say is
that' President Woodrow Wilson is tho
first Democratic Chief Executive of
tho United States to succeed himself
since tho re-election of President An
drew Jacksbn in 1832. i
Interest in the forthcoming feature
photoplay entitled, "The Birth of a
Race,'' is not confined to any partic
ular class or color. Movie fans
throughout the country, managers and
producers, have eagerly sought inform
ation in regard to the prospective time
of release, and incidentally, to find out
how they may obtain an interest in the
picture. The stock selling campaign
has been a surprise to the management,
for, while they had expocted tho an
iujuncenient would, create no little in
terest, they were unprepared for the
hearty interest manifested in every
direction.
Story of Universal Appeal.
"The Birth of a Race" is not a
Colored picture, but a White man's
picture, dealing with his Colored citizen
and co-laborer, in a spirit of fact with
fairness. There will be no idealiza
tions, no striving for effects. The sub
ject is so broad and interesting that by
adhering closely to actual conditions
the story can be made vitally interest
ing and entertaining. There will bo no
spirit of antagonism, no animosity, but
every effort will be made to build a
picture that will prove a masterpiece
of entertainment and instruction.
The Company.
Eariy in the summer a company was
incorporated under the name of the
Birth of a Race Photoplay Corporation
and capitalized at $1,000,000, for th
production and exhibition of "The
Birth of a Race." Contract was at
once made with Selig Polyscope Com
pany of Chicago to produce the pic
ture, and Colonel Selig entered into
tho spirit of the enterprise with en
thusiasm. But, the story of the organization
goes back even farther than this. The
appearance, and popularity in this
country of a great picture play, some
two years ago, caused quite a commo
tion. Race prejudice, which seemed to
be dying a slow but natural death, was
revived, and a loud cry went up from
different sections of the countrv for its
suppression. In the picturo tho Negro
was stigmatized . as a beast, a rapist
and renegade. He was shown in his
meanest form as typical of his race.
It is not stranco that such men as
Booker T. Washington and other lcad-
i
J
i
.&.
ers looked about for a remedy to
counteract tho evil. Plans were at
once made, but the untimely death of
Dr. Washington delaved their consum
mation. S
Finally, Edwin L. Barker, the author
of several popular stories and some
noteworthy photoplays, was prevailed
upon to undertake the building of a
master racial photoplay, and a cor
poration was formed for tho purpose.
The Story.
Mr. Barker is a man of resources.
Ho realized from the beginning that
to compete with the great producers of
the age was a full-sized man's job, and
ho began to cast about for a cabinet
of assistants in whom ho could place
over confidence. Emmctt J. Scott
seemed to be the logical man to know
the Negro sido of tho question. 'His
connection for twenty years with
Tuskegee Institute, and association
with Dr. Washington had vplaced him

HON. EDWARD J. GLACKIN.
One of the influential and popular members of the Illinois State Senate who
is ever ready to champion any worthy cause which will be beneficial to
all the people residing in this state.
in a position to furnish invaluable data
and assistance. Geo. Frederick Wheel
er, a writer of renown, a sccnarioist
and authority on motion pictures, was
next added to the forces, to write the
scenario in collaboration with Mr.
Scott. The story placed in the hands
of these men of experience and attain
ment is sure to bo all that can be de
sired. " Four months have already been
spent in its preparation, and from
every indication the result will be the
most thrilling, absorbing and interest
ing picture ever produced.
To Africa for Prologue.
The picture is to bo in twelve parts.
The "Prologue is laid in Africa and a
special trip will be made to that con
tinent for the opening reel of this great
photoplay. Tho capturo of slaves,
trikking to the distant coast with
appalling hardships and consequent loss
of life, tho herding of the captives on
shipboard, tho storm and shipwreck at
sea, will all furnish excitement enough
in tho beginning to warrant a heart
interest in tho story which is to follow.
The scenes for tho body of the photo
play are, of course, laid in the South
land, tho natural home of tho Afro
American. It was there he toiled, was
emancipated and has remained for the
greater part. Thoso who have immi
grated aro but incident to the whole.
Conditions of his scrvitndo through the
long period of his enslavement, his
actual joys and sorrows, his .relation
to his master and to his race, will all
bavo faithful attention.
Tho Northern misunderstanding, and
tho Southern autocracy, will alike be
shown. Secession, grim war, emancipa
tion, reconstruction with its many evils,
will be justly portrayed, for they all
figure mightily in the birth of a race.
No Attempt to Solve a Problem.
No attempt will be made to solve
tho so-called Negro Problem. To re
view the writing of the erudite of the
past half century, would prove the
futility of such an attempt. Progress
will be shown, a progress that is the
marvel of the world. There can be no
segregation of the races in thin poly
racial land. The result of any equa
tion of tho question will be that all
must live and labor together for the
good of a common country and a com
mon flag. Whatever will tend to im
proving conditions and make this lifo
more congeniaj, whatever will help to
ameliorate any racial differences, nnij.t
redound to the good of all.
"The Birth of a Race" is a produc
tion which nill have the patronage of
tho world at large. It is not a picture
for a day, but for an age. It is not
for tho benefit of any particular class
or section, but a picture, for all the
people, with tho object of a better
understanding universally, and a hope
for general improvement.
MAJOR ROBERT R. JACKSON
