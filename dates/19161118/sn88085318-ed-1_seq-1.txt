OFFICIAL VOTE
IN COUNTY
News and Comment
of the Election
The official count which ha»
been made by the various states
since election day has been
watched with interest, but only
an increasing vote for Wilson in
Minnesota, New Hampshire, New
Mexico and Colifornia has marked
the count. Chairman Willcox of
the republican national commit
tee has steadfastly refused to con
cede the election of Wilson, prob
ably awaiting the returns from
Halifax and North Borneo.
The count in Stevens county
was finished Thursday morning,
and disclosed the fact to an anx
ious world that Haskins, demo
cratic candidate for legislature,
is beaten by Hayden. Foster,
republican candidate for coroner,
is beaten by Rigg. Whether this
trade will suit the world has not
been ascertained, but it is the on
ly change found in the unofficial
report published last week.
The complete official return is
found in this paper.
Woodrow Wilson carried prac
tically two thirds of the states.
He received 2i million more
votes than in his first election,
which is the greatest increase
ever given to an American presi
dent.
He received two million more
votes than any former democrat
ic candidate for president.
He received the largest popular
vote ever given to any president:
He received a million more
votes than the combined Taft-
Roosevelt vote of 1912.
His total plurality was about a
half million over Hughes.
The election laws provide that
on the second Monday in Jan
uary the electors of each" state
shall meet and cast their vote for
president and vice president.
This vote is then wired to Wash
ington City by one of the electors
and on the second Wednesday in
February the electoral votes are
counted by Congress.
Chairman Wilcox and his
friends must have had consider
able at stake to take their politi
cal defeat so seriously. Wonder
if all their recent investments
had been in munitions stock.
Lincoln county elected 7 demo
crats, including 2 representatives.
Spokane county elected but one
democrat, a representative. Pend
Oreille county elected 8 demo
crats. Ferry county elected 4
democrats, and gave Dill a plur
ality of 600. Okanogan county
elected 4 democrats and gave
Dill a plurality of about 1400.
The city of Spokane gave Wilson
1116 plurality.
Presents indications are that
Ferry county is entitled to be
called the banner democratic
county of Washington. Edward
Moore, who is democratic precinct
committeeman of Meteor precinct,
Ferrry county, has also set up
the claim that he has the banner
democratic precinct of the state,
and to substantiate this allega
tion has sent a tabulation of the
vote to Spokane democratic head
quarters, with a challenge to any
other is show a more consistent
record. The vote in Meteor pre
cinct was: Wilson 86, Hughes 10;
Turner 83, Poindexter 14; Dill
87, Corkery 9; Lister 85, Mcßride
12.
That Mason and Dixon line
always did cause more or less
trouble—now look what it has
donel
Governor Lister made the strongest race in Stevens
county of any candidate on any ticket
The loss of the state of Wash
ington to Wilson and the conse
quent defeat of Hughes were due
to the attitude of the republican
state committee towards the pro
gressives, is the opinion of L.
Roy Slater, former chairman of
the progressive state central com
mittee. It now looks as if Wil
son is elected," said Mr. Slater.
"If this is true the defeat of
Hughes can be laid at the door
of the republican state central
•committee. The bull moose was
ready and anxious to affiliate but
they were not willing to crawl
under the tent. My own name
was placed on the list of the ex
ecutive committee, but it was
done merely as a sop to catch
votes. I refused to act when the
leaders of Pierce county, Seattle
and other counties were ignored.
Ole Hanson, C. .1. France, Ed
Snyder and others could have
been tied in the republican organ
ization in the early stages if they
had been given proper represent
ation in the first Hush of the
Hughes campaign. The repub
licans of this state ignored the
progressives and did not want
them to take part in the cam
paign, and when they finally rea
lized the seriousness of the tiitu
ation it was too late."
Chas. P. .Lund of Spokane,
chairman of this state's republi
can delegation to the Chicago
convention, says: "Hughes got
just as many votes as any candi
date we could have named. Some
people claim that Roosevelt would
have made a better run. Pos
sibly he would have in the west,
but Hughes carried every big
eastern state that a republican
candidate could be expected to
carry, and some that a republican
could not -expect. Roosevelt
would have lost the great Ger
man vote, which stayed with
Hughes to the end. It is apparent
that the great body of the pro
gressive vote cast for Roosevelt
in 1012 is still dragging its an
chor. It is not attached to the
republican party and could not
be held to Hughes. Roosevelt
might have held it. No one else
could, though many people voted
for Hughes who would not have
voted for Roosevelt."
One of Spokane's leading stake
holders for election bets says:
"Twenty to thirty thousand dol
lar* of New York money, sent to
Spokane to get the Wilson odds
that prevailed in the betting here,
will itay in Spokane as result of
the tlection. In New York the
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
odds favored Hughes and New
York betters sent money here
where the sentiment was the
other way. The amount of money
lost on Hughes by Spokane men
was small, as the Hughes local
money was inconsiderable. The
only reason that Wilson backers
do not stand to win more is be
cause of the apparent lack of
Hughes money. 1 could have
easily placed between $50,000 and
$75,000 more than 1 did, but
there was no Hughes money to
cover it. I had inquiries from
Lethbridge, North Yakima and
from several places in British
Columbia representing sums from
$1000 to $10,000 asking if there
was any Hughes money in sight.
These I was forced to turn down."
The following editorial appear
ed Nov. 10 in the American Econ
omist, the official organ of the
high tariff organization which
has for years controlled the re
publican party of the east. It
was based on the belief that
Hughes had been elected: "At
the close of one of the hardest
fought campaigns in American
political history the victory of
sound sense and true patriotism
is won. The election of (lharles
Evans Hughes as president and
Charles Warren Fairbanks means
that the American people have
demanded a return to real Ameri
canism. It means America first
and America for Americans.
That the battle was decided upon
the single issue of restored Pro
tection for American labor and
industry there is no shadow of
doubt. It could not have been
won on any other issue."
Woodrow Wilson: "The repub
lican party is just the party
that cannot meet tlie new con
ditions of a new age. It does
not know the way and it does
not wißh new conditions. It tried
to break away from the old lead
ers and could not. They still
select its candidates and dictate
its policy, still resist change, atill
hanker after old conditions, still
know no methods of encourag
ing business but the old methods.
When it changes its leaders and
its purposes and brings its ideas
up to date, it will have the right
to ask the American people to
give it power again; but not un
til then. A new age, an age of
revolutionary change, needs new
purposes and new ideas."
State Capital Record: If there
is any one feature that stands
out in the present campaign, it is
