ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
Perry J. Wilson, San Rafael
farmer and alsosomething of a
botanist, has photographed over
thirty-five varieties of native
wild flowers found in this part
of the state. He is now await
ing another rain in order to con
tinue his work. The photographs
will be flinted the natural colors,
and when completed will prove
a most interesting collection.
It is understood that the North
Dominion Copper Mining and
Development corporation of
Globe will erect a large smelter
on the company's property near
Radium station that will not on
ly take care of their own ore,
boat wi41 smelt all the ore in the
district which is now being ship
ped at great expense. Such a
smelter will save the producers
of the section thousands of dol
lars each year.
Previous records for copper
production were exceeded dur
ing October by the Douglas
smelters, when 24,"600,000 pounds
of copper was turned out. Of
this amount the Cooper Queen
smelter turned out 16,400,000, or
exactly twice as much as the
C & A. smelter where produc
tion for October was 8,200,000
pounds. The output of both
smelters includes a considerable
amount of customs ore.
That the prohibition amend
ment to the state constitution
-has carried by an overwhelm
ingly majority is the news re
ceived at the office of the Ari
zona Temperance Federation.
So far as returns have been re
ceived it is indicated that every
county in the state has given it
a substantial majority, though
the returns are incomplete. Lo
cal option has been defeated by
much great majorities than the
prohibition amendment has been
adopted.
A vein of rich ruby silver run
ning as high as 9,000 ounces of
silver to the ton has been struck
on the old American Flag mine
in the Wallapai mountains.
About two tons of the ore have
been sacked for shipment. The
American Flag mine was opened
'forty years ago, and was former
erly worked by miners from
Cornvvell, Wales. The strike
was made while erosscutting
from the lower tunnel on the
property.
Following the sale of pre or
ganization stock by the Jerome
Verde Contract Copper company,
the corporation commission has
issued an order requiring the
company to return all money
collected to the subscribers for
pre-organization stock, and to
tile with the commission on or be
fore Nov. 15 a complete report
of all stock selling transactions
The company has also been or
dered to furnish the commission
with copies of its letters to sub
scribers. Title to fifteen townsites in
and around the town of Oatman,
Mohave county is vested in the
holders of mineral patents to
the land, according to advices
received at the local U. S. land
office in reply to a query from
owners of lots in the townsites,
owing to a dispute which arose
recently between squatters and
purchasers of the lots. Accord
ing to the laud office if mineral
patent to the land has been is
sued the lot owners should make
their arrangements with the
holders of these patents.
W. H. Barnett returned home
to Patagonia last Sunday after
noon from an extended hunting
and fishing trip of several weeks
in the Verde and Mogollon coun
try. He reports a successful
and highly enjoyable trip, and
found plenty of wild turkey and
trout. Like almost every one
else who has lived in the great
Patagonia country, Mr. Barnett
is glad to be back again. While
he traversed many hundreds of
miles of the southwestern coun
try while away, he says he saw
nothing on the entire trip that
compares with Patagonia, either
as a cattle or a mining region.

President Wilson's Election Pleases
English Editors.
London, Nov. 10. The re
election of President Wilson is
welcomed by the Weekly Nation
as an event favorable both to
peace and to the cause of state
liberty, and the paper thinks
that his election offers hopes of
an earl'er end to the war agony
than any nation enduring it can
yet foresee. William Henry
Massingham, the editor, in a
special article referring to Pre
sident Wilson says:
"The resources of the Europ
ean statesmanship are not so
rich, nor are its personalities so
inspiring that it can readily dis
pense with an accute, powerful,
and in some degree, prophetic
intellect at the head of the great
est power that the war has left
standing and the most sym
pathetic to ourselves. I think
that most men and women here
who take more than casual in
terest in American polities read
the news of Mr. Hughes' eariier
success with sinking hearts."
The New Statesman regards
it as better for the entente allies
to have to do with a president
whose mind they know and who
is unlikely to raise serious diffi
culties concerning the British
blockade.
"Moreover," it adds, "Wilson
is the more likely to be interest
ed personally in the promotion
of an Anglo-American entente
on the creation of which after
the war so many important
things will depend."
The Largest Vote Ever Cast For Pre
sident. Secretary Tumulty sent the
following message to President
Wilson at Williamstown:
"Election returns conclusively
demonstrate that your victory at
the polls is clear and decisive.
You h-ave carried two thirds of
the states of the Union. The
four years of your administra
tion have brought you approxi
mately 2,266,614, more votes
than when you were first elected
in 1912. This is the greatest in
crease given to an American
president for a second term
since the Civil war. Your vote
last Tuesday was 2,060,708 more
than ever previously recorded
for a democratic candidate and
despite character of opposition,
is the largest vote ever received
by a president from the people
of this country 952,955 more
than the total Taft-Roosevelt
vote in 1912. You have a pop
ular plurality of 403,312 accord
ing to bulletin received from the
Associated Press."
From returns and reasonable
estimates President Wilson re
ceived the largest popular vote
ever cast for any president. His
total vote is more than eight
and a half millions, giving him
the endorsement of the people of
the nation so emphatically that
in future to use the language of
Mr. Hughes, "we will be all in
one boat." Had it not been for
partisan politics with candidates
for'state and county offices run
ning in every county in the Unit
ed States the president would
have had a much larger popular
majority.
The re election of Wood row
Wilson is a fine tribute to the
achievements of a democratic
president and a democratic con
gress, and is a most convincing
argument that the people of
this nation are perfectly satisfied
to permit the unparalled pros
perity of the past three years
to continue for another four
years and a half at least. The
fact that the west went almost
solidly for Wilson is significant
in that hereafter the west must
be reckoned with in national
elections, and that no longer is
it possible for the state of New
York to decide presidential elec
tions with the old time certain
ty. Laying aside these argu
ments it is also significant that
this nation is not looking for
trouble with any other nation.
It is now the duty of every eiti
zen to lend every support to the
administration to the end that
the present era of prosperity
will be definitely continued.

Smelters Give True Returns.
The idea seems prevalent
among men opeaating small
properties in mining districts of
Arizona that the smelters and
custom mills havein many cases,
given false returns on ores that
are sent in for smelting and
treatment. With a view to as
certaining the facts of the case,
the Arizona State Bureau of
Mines has conducted an inves
tigation and has found that it
would be utterly impracticable
for any smelter or mill to so
falsify its method of sampling as
to give low returns and still give
the shipper one half of the sam
ple to allow check assays to be
made. Bulletin No 26 of the
Arizona State Bureau of Mines
was written with the idea of
showing the small shipper how
to satnple, so that he may sam
ple his ores before shipment to
ascertain the correct value, there
by having a check on the smelt
ers. Smelter methods of sam
pling are given in considerable
detail, so that the reader may
determine for himself that, ow
ing to the great changes in the
routine and the large number of
men who would be concerned in
any falsifying system, the smelt
ers could not afford to give in
correct returns.
It must also be considered that
when the Copper Queen mine,
for instance, ships to the Copper
Queen smelter, the smelter pur
chases the ore precisely the same
as they do the ore of the man who
ships ten tons, and the sampling
and umpires are done under the
same conditions.
Details as to the smelter me
thods of sampling are given in
Bulletin No. 26, Arizona State
Bureau of Mines, entitled "Mill
& Smelter Sampling," by H. J.
Stander, and may be obtained by
writing Chailes F. Wills, Direct
or, Arizona State Bureau of
Mines, Tucson, Arizona.
The Corporation Commission
reports that twenty-five com
panies filed their articlas of in
corporation with the commission
during the last week of October.
Twenty of these were mining
companies, whose plans contem
plate opening up copper prop
erties in different parts of the
state.
WELL MANAGED CAMPAIGN.
Never was a political campaign
in Arizona managed in a more
able, energetic and concientious
manner than was that for the
democratic party this year, by
George J. Stoneman. Ever alert
and attentive to his duties as
directing official of the party,
as chairman of the democratic
state central committee he used
every legitimate means to carry
the party through to a success
ful issue.
The handsome majorities re
ceived by every candidate on
the ticket, except one, is a re
cord of efficiency in this respect,
which is a cause of self congra
tulation. Without entering into
any discussions as to the causes
of the defeat of this single ex
ception, no management on earth
could have prevented it.
Chairman Stoneman left no
stone unturned to avert the re
sult in this, as well as to secure
a straight out vote of all demo
crats for all the democratic can
didates, his slogan from first to
last being "vote the ticket
straight." That his efforts were
not seconded by a majority of
the party for one candidate was
no fault of his. No one could
have done better.
It was not occasioned by any
neglect of anything on his part,
nor was it on account of person
al abuse or viilification of the
opposing candidates, a means
very often which brings about
the very opposite effect desired.
It was a clean cut and honor
able campaign from start to
finish on his part, and be it said
also on the part of the candi
dates on both sides. While pol
itical campaigns, as a rule beget,
extravagant and many times
even slanderous utterances, the
one just closed was perhaps one
of the cleanest ever made in
Arizona, which is creditable alike
to all concerned.
Chairman Stoneman won the
respect of - his opponents and
earned the gratitude of Lis party
by his dignified and honorable
management of the campaign,

Mjpes of Mexico Have Resumed Work.
The mining interests of Mex
ico are recovering from the para
lyzation occasioned by the period
of insecurity at a rate little short
of marvelous. All of the mines
in the Guanajuato district that
were closed down for want of
dynamite and other necessary
supplies have resumed opera
tions, thanks to the arrival last
week of 150,000 worth of dyna
mite and other explosives irom
the United States. Advices from
Guanajuato also state that the
distress among the poor of that
city, that existed sometime past
due to lack of work and supplies,
has been completely remedied.
All the miners now have work,
and in addition the government
took steps last week to send a
large consignment of corn and
frijoles to Guanajuato which was
distributed among the poor of
that city. In Mexico the mining
industry is a most important
one. Mexico produces over two
thirds of the silver of the world
to say nothing of vast quantities
of gold, copper, lead, zinc, iron,
coal, petroleum and other min
erals. It is the most highly
mineralized country in the world.
And by reason of this fact the
revival of the mining industry
is always and ever the surest
sign of returning prosperity in
Mexico. Mexican News.
These mornings it is not an
uncommon sight to see children
trudging along the roads heavily
laden with beautiful roses, luxu
riant evidences of the result of
irrigation upon Arizona's deserts.
These veritable morning rose
gardens wend their way to the
school house where a "rose
shower" is given the teachers.
We can well imagine the sur
prise this beautiful custom has
been to some of our eastern
friends, who have grown up
with the idea that Arizona spell
ed desert. The school children
with their rose showers are do
ing a great deal to tear down the
false conception mauy people
have of this great state. Tax
