SCOTT
A QUEER ELECTION.
Party Lines Ignored and Scratching General. --Socialist
Party Makes Big Gains in the Nation.
At the Kicker wont to pren last
week the presidential election
jind much else wH la douiit. The
eftfljr returns indicated Hughes.
These return enme from the
east, wliere the dny closes eniiicr
nnd from Illinois where the polls
close early.
Hut when the returns began t
come in from the west, hope in
the Democratic bosom began to
swell, iiiul all day Wednesday and
until 10 o'clock Thursday night,
the ginvost dO'Jbt existed. Not
until Thursday night, when the
report came that Wilson had ent
iled California, was it considered
nafC for a Democrat to yell. But
he jelled then..
I was in Cairo watching the
nulletins as they came in. A tre
mendous crowd filled the streets.
Those people seemed to be wage
earners men and women. Thor"
the women vote nnd were in the
crowd, but they did not net as
crazy as the men.
When a bulletin appeared favor
able to Hughes, about one-half of
tlie mob would yell. When one ap
peared favorable to Wilson, the
other half would make fools of
themselves. And ns I watched the
crazy doings 1 remembered the
Having of Puck. "What fools we
mortal! be." To this howling
mob it didn't matter a whiff of
east wind which would draw the
presidential salary for the next
four years.
Kifiht months ago it did not ap
pear to me ns if Wilson had the
lightest chance of re-election
lie ov.es everything to the char
acter and stupidity of his oppo
sition, To begin with, the Repub
licans made tne very worst sell 0
tion 1 1 ssiblo in choosing H Ighes
whose part in the Danburj Hat
ters' case was so fresh in the
minds of Organized Labor. Not
satisfied With this, they loaded
themselves down with Roosevelt,
who had caused their defeat four
years ago.
Had tlie Republican managers
put both Hughes and Roosevelt
111 cold storage until after the
election, they could have vvon in
a walk. But Wilson was shrewd
DOUgh to let them do the talking
and every time they opened their
mouths they made votes for Wil
oii. Vet neither of them ever
made
i itlc
a definite statement. 1 uey
:sed what the president had
but never said what should
been done, or what they
done,
have
would have
done under like eir-
cumstances.
The platforms adopted by the
two parties in June were ignored.
They were so nearly alike that
it was impossible to kick up a
tuss over their difference. Hence
the voters were fed on platitudes,
bunk and piffle.
The voters seemed bewildered.
Never Were party lines so com
pletely eliminated. Scratching
was the feature of the day. While
California was carried by Wilson,
vet Hiram Johnson, Republican
carried the state by 100,000 for
United states senator
Like circumstances are found in
many states. In Missouri Wilson
won' by about 30,000, while the
goveruerahip was very close and
in do.ibt for several days, and J.
P, Gordon) Democrat, was defeat
ed bv George Haokmann, Repub
lican", by about 20,000 for state
B editor.
In this presidential election the
women cast about four million
votes. These, excepting Ullno.s,,
ire ii in the west. In the states
f Wyoming! California, Arizona,
Kansas, Oregon, Nevada, Montana
In Illinois the. Women voted their
fiest time for president, and is
the only state cast of the Missis
sippi river In which the women
vote. The first women elected to
lonmv.ss is from Montana.
Another element In polities that
was "smoked out" In this election
was the priesthood. "The
church" had been unable to drive
Mr. Wilson all the Way In Mexico
He listened to the protests of the
people and halted bis invasions
twice once at Vera Cru, and
the present one which crossed the
bonier at Columbus.
1 have In my possession a circu
lar letter sent Out from New York
by .ho Cental Veroin and distrib
uted among Cathol.cs This o.rcu
lar contains resolutions adopted
by a convention Of the Central
Verein criticising, or rather con
demning, the president's Mexican
policy and concludes:
"J'atriottic duty and the best
interests of our country demand
the decisive defent of the pres
ent incumbent or the office of
president, the man who is striv
ing to bring about racial cleav
age among the people of our be
loved country. Let his defeat be
so pronounced and decisive that
his successor take heed and resist
the un-American influence which
have dominated our present ad
ministration." The "un-American influences
referred to were the millions of
letters and telegrams of protest
torn the people sent to the pres
ident nnd congress when the in
vasion of Mexico wns attempted.
However, the e ffoi ts of "the
Ohuroh" to swing the vote were
not as successful as in the past.
Too many of our Cntholics under-
stand Hint the Mexicans are also
Catholics and are not fightinu:
against their religion nor their
native priests. They nre fighting
for exactly the same thing that
George Washington and his fol
lowers fought forLiberty ! And
In this fight the native priests
jnre with them, while the Ppnnish
i priests sided with the Diaz tyrnn
I ny and were made to go with
I him.
Many things happen during an
election which baffle understand-
ing. unless we nr.'Piit the fact
that the masses are ignorant of
politics ai'd political conditions,
and therefore substitute preju
dice for reason.
Take, for instance. Missouri.
During the past four years the
state has been given such shame
ful government by the Ma lor ad
ministration that even Deinocrn-
ministration that even Demo
cratic politicians feared thev
'could not cram it down their
'dupes, Hence all of them that
offered for re-election were elimi-
anted at tlie primary, except
John P. Gordon, the state auditor,
and he was defeated last week by
some six thousand.
This proves that the voters
j knew that tlie state administra
tion was bad. However, during
J the campaign all of the Demo
cratic candidates, from Gardner
down, indorsed the Major admin
I istrution promising nothing bet
I tor and by voting for these ean
'didntos the people Indorsed the
very administration they had
overwhelmingly rejected in the
prima ry.
j Their head petl-blnder was Hob
Ward, a Caruthersville lawyer
' who watits Joe Russell's place
rext time.
Now, the people of .Scott count j
, are familllar with conditions i.i
Pemiscot county. They know
'what the Democratic machine
down there of which Mr. Ward is
I probably the engine and fly
, wheel has done for that county.
For 15 years Ward has been tell
ing the Rubes down there how to
vote, and they took his advice.
! Today that county is bankrupt
I and can neither cure for its pau
I pern nor insane. Yet the Scott
county patriots bring Ward here
I to toll the Rubes what is goad for
them. And they listen. and
v hoop and yell.
Never were the people so bewil
dered as in the recent election.
They did not know which way to
jump. They were not satisfied
With the kind of government the
Democrats were giving them, and
'the Republicans offered them
nothing better. With the world
;on fire they talked about the con
stitutionality of the so-called
elghtphOUT law, land banks and
tariff.
What the people were really in
terested in was either evaded or
mentioned in a way that meant
nothing. With a hundred thous
and of our troops in Mexico and
on tlie border, neither party inti
mated what .-ho ild be done, ex
cept In meaningless piffle, Neith
er party mentioned the draft lavv
recently enacted by congress.
President Wilson signed this law
I In June, and Cnndidate Hughes,
j by his silence, approved of his ac
jtion. O.ir food is being cornered
i by speculators to be shipped out,
land starvation threatens the peo
' pie, but this did not concern the
politicians, What our attitude
should be toward the European
'struggle was of no concern, it
I was a campaign of bunk and
blabber and, in a hazy way, the
people realized it. But there was
: no escape, The profit-mongers
who manipulate both old parties
had blocked the game.
"He kept us out of war," shout
ed the Democrats, is a man ci
, titled to credit for not fighting;
'when nobody wants to fight?
i wiiat nation wanted to fight i s?
Had either the Kaiser or Carran-
za displayed as much bluff ns our
president, we would now b e in
: war. It was the Kaiser and Car-
ranza that kept us out of war,
and not Wilson.
Nationally tho Democrats still
have a majority in the Senate,
but in the liousj it is doubtful
Which party will control. I hope
tho Democrats will get it all, for
the reason that nothing will be

Milwaukee, Wis., Nov. 9. Tho
Socialists will increase their rep
lepresentation in the next legis
lature by one, the party having
elfCted seven assemblymen and
two new senators.
With Senator Ixuis Arnold,
there will be three Socialists in
the next state senate, Zumacll
being elected in the Sixth district
over Melting, Republican, by 1(53
votes, and Raguse in the Light h
district over Martin. Republican,
by 2,281 votes.
Early returns indicated the
election of Victor Ilurger, Social
ist, to congress from the Fifth
district, but complete returns
show the election of his "non-par
tisan" opponent, although Burger
I received nearly 4,13o votes more
than two years ago.
I w. R. Gayiord. Bocialist candi
date for congress from the
Fourth district, was defeated by
4(12 votes. II,. led in Bouth Mil
iwr.ukoe, but thus lead was over
coin e In tlie country districts.
His gain over two years ago was
1 ,703.
The administration of Winfred
C. Zabel in the office of district
attorney received an overwhelm
ing indorsement in his re-election

total vote of 80,868, and Wurster
86,861.
Minneapolis, Nov. 8. Thomas
Van Lear. Socialist candidate fie
mayor, was elected here bv a
majority of .".000.
The election is the result of i
vigorous campaign made by or
ganized labor and the Socialist
i party.
Van Lear is a member of the
machinists' union. In the prima
I rlei he received the highest vote
in a contest In which eight can
didates competed,
I Since then his opponents have
left nothing undone to cause his
dcfi ut.
Tliey refused to discuss local Is
! sues, but confined their argu
ments to distorted discussions of
Socialism. Speakers were import
ed from other cities where Social
i ists had held office to misrepre
sent facts in an endeavor to cloud
I the issues.
Van Lear refused to be drawn
into any of these arguments, but
made his campaign strict;.' on lo
cal issues.
Organized labor stood behind
their candidate and contributed
not only their labor but their
dimes and dollars.
Two Socialist aldermen and a
member of the school board were
elected.
One Socialist has been re-elected
to the state legislature. Can
didates n the congressional elect
ion made a good showing, both
running second.
