EXILING OF BELGIANS
Being Deported into Germany at Hate
of 2000 Daily.
The Hague. Nov. 18. The n dinner
of Belgians deported by tho Germans
up to date, according to information
Klven to the Associated Press jester
day from a reliable source heve ap
parently is between SO.OOu and 40.000,
and they are being deported at the
rate of about 2000 daily. Antwerp
it was said, has been commanded lo
furnish 27,000 men, which is probably
not mote than 10 per cent of its able
bodied population, but tbe commune
of Lesslne.s has iost more tliau 2000
from a total population, including
women and children of 7000, repre
senting virtually every able-bodied
men excepting officials.
The entire Belgian population, the
narrator said, is terrorized because
the people realize they are entirely
helpless. Crowds of hysterical wom
en and children gather at the railway
and recruiting stations, and many
women at Jemappes threw tnemselves
on the rails to prevent the departure
of a train of emigrants and had to be
forcibly removed by German soldiers.'
The men avo frequently loaded into
cattle cars and spend one or two days
on the Journey. They are strongly de
termined to refuse to work, believing
that If they are not employed In mili
tary works they will be compelled to
replace Germans and bnforced to
work, directly or indirectly, against
tho Belgian army and Its allies. The
deported men in trains passing
through Liege are declared to have
been heard singing the Marseillaise
and other patriotic airs.
The newspapers report a case near
Vallenciennes of 00 Fienchmen who,
Impressed b ythc Germans, refused to
work and are declared to have been
tied to posts for 4S hours until half
of them fainted from hardships and
hunger.
TWO DOES SHOT
Buck With Horna Under Length
Found Also Deer Scarce.
Montpelier, Nov. 16. Reports of
two dots and a buck with horns under
length being shot on t,he opening day
ot deer season are being Investigated
by County Game Warden H. J. Con
ant. One doe was found shot on land
owned by Lord brothers in West Ber
lin and was brought to a local market
at the game warden's request. An
other doe was found tufcl reported by
William Pecue in the Jones Brook
region and a small buck was found in
the river at Northfleld Falls.
In spite of tho favorable conditions
hunters are either unsuccessful or are
not reporting their deer promptly, for
only one person, Warner Hill, a post
office clerk, had reported up to this
afternoon. He secured a buck weigh
ing 160 pounds in Moretown.
Rutland, Nov. 10. Reports of suc
cessful deer hunters in this vicinity
are unusually few so far for the first
two days ol the hunting season. Not
a head has yet been exhibited to
County Warden F. W. Hayward of this
city So far the only Rutland men to
secure bucks are F. H. Pike, a grocer,
who was absent from the city only
three hours, going on foot, and Wil
liam Hogan. a trainmen, who killed
a fine animal in Bellows Falls.
Weather conditions are ho severe
that few reports have been received
from the many hunting camps in the
mountains east of this city, in Men
don, Chittenden and Sherburne. The
enthusiasm of many hunters was so
dampened by the zero temperature
and deep snow of the first day that
they hung up their rifles after a single
fruitless clay.

BOSTON AUDIENCE
I0LD BY SUNDAY
TOlOOSEfiOP"
Evangelist Disappointed Over Size
of His Collections
20,GOO PEOPLE II TABERNACLE
!
Tells Students There is More Hope
for a Fool Than for the Boy Who
Knows It All.
Boston, Nov. 17. Fully 20,000 peo
ple had thronged the Billy Sunday
tabernacle tonight when the noted
evangelist mounted the rostrum at
7.30 o'clock. Outside thousands clam
ored for admission. Some of the more
daring climbed to the roof of the struc
turo and attempted to hear the ath
letic preacher through the skylights.
Every available , lilt of space was oc
cupied. Men were clinging to the
rafters and even the platform from
which Billy spoke was fringed with
people.
It took the combined efforts of the
police and firemen assigned to the
job to keep the crowd from choking
tho runways and exits o great was
the jam of people eager to hear his
student night's sornion on "Forces that
win." Thousands of students from
Harvard, Tufts, Technology, t Welles
ley, Radcllffe and Simmons were in
the uudjence.
In the afterndon, when Sunday
preached on "Personal work," more
than 7000 attended. In spite of the
large attendance at the meetings Mr.
Sunday was disappointed at the
amount of the collections and was not
backward in letting his hearers know
his feelings. In his characteristic
way he exhorted them to "loosen up."
The collection at tonight's service
was only $000, he said, "why, a west
ern city of 100,000 would do better
than that." X total of $1102.01 was
collected at the i.vo services today, ac
cording to the treasurer of the cam
paign. Billy Sunday was obviously pleased
with the throng that greeted him to
night in spite of the weather, which
was a mixture of snow and rain. Ho
launched into his topic with unusual
spice and in less than a minute was
pacing around the rostrum, speaking
with such rapidity that it was impos
sible for the newspaper stenographVs
to follow him. It was good, sound,
fatherly advice that he gave the stu
dent throng and he visibly Impressed
his audience with his characteristic
stories of the modern college chap.
Preaching a special sermon to
young people in the tabernacle last
evening on "Forces that win," the
evengeiist said:
"At the time of President McKin
ley's funoral procession this country
for five minutes stopped all work.
The railroads, every factory, the ma
chinery of this land stood still; the
banker stopped counting his money,
the merchant quit measuring the
commodities and left them unmeas
ured, the farmer stopped his plow in
the furrow, every student closed his
book for five minutes, and with un
covered heads we all attempted to pay
a mark of respect and tribute to tho
man who had tried to make this a
better nation, end happier men and
women and children. We did that,
and I am glad we did that, thus show
ing to tho people that we did not for
get to place a high value on charac
ter, although we seem at times to he
commercially dazed and drunk. We
stood still long enough to testify to
the world that it matters not. to what
political party a man belongs if he
tries to make this a better nation and
make better homes.
Now, young folks. I want to say
something with tho hope that I can
induce you to put your life in italics.
This element in us; this hope for
something hotter is Nature clearing
the ground. That is why. the young
man goes west. He is tired of being
a molehill end wants to be a moun
tain. A midget ii mind, and e midget in
character, is like a carbuncle.
"I'll tell you, you can't look up and
admire a runt in mind and a runt In
character unless you are married to
the runt, and then you do it under
pretest.
Now, boys and girls, excuse me for
calling you boys and girls. You are
young men and women, but I coll
you boys and girls. You have got to
have a desire to grow up and develop.
You have got to feel your need to
grow, just like a miser wants juoney,
or a politician wants office, and like
a hog wants slop.
"I will tell you something, boys,
that will be a millstone around your
neck self conceit. It is a sad day
for a young fellow when President
Taft's overcoat wouldu't make him a
vest. Boys, there is more hope for
the fool than for the fellow that
thinks he knows It all.
"Another thing. Look on the bright
side of life. Over In Spain there Is a
sun dial, and It says: 'I mark only the
bright hours.' So look on the bright
side. Every time you smile you put

Paris, Nov. 16. Minister of the in
terior Malvy has instructed the pre
fects of every department In France
to appeal. In cooperation with the
Mayors of the communes, to the peo
ple to reduce as far as possible the
lighting of their homes and business
establishments.
Bills posted throughout Paris signed

deaf and dumb, is to be married soon
to her secretary Peter Fagan, accord
ing to statements made here today

"THE STORY OF THE ROSARY"
Delightful and Sweet Play at Opera
House Friday Evening.
"The Story of the Rosary," a touch
ing little play dealing with soldier
life, was the offering of the Joseph
W.- Payton stock company at the
opera house Friday evening. A fair

minor parts being played wlUi care
and ability.
Douglass Dumbrlllc as Captain Paul
Romaine had the main male part.
Miss Ritchie Clark Russell filling the

cellent; Edward Damey as Peterkin
and Miss Lenette as the colonel's
daughter also merited much praise.

Spoilers" with a cast of seventeen.
The Joseph W. Payton Stock com
pany deservedly ranks amqjig the
best of Its kind and the plays present
ed In Bennington during tho past

selfishness In Prayer."
