Hie tug. CapL Hinsch was confined
to his home today threatened with
pneumonia.
Capt. Paul Kocnig of the Deutsch

thf federal investigators.
It was reported that insurance
companies and the owners of the
sunken tug might start legal pro
ceedings and libel the Deutschland,

of the submarine gave assurance
today that all claims would be met

daybreak, ran down the tu- which
was acting as her protector, off
Kace Rock, just outside this pirt.
The testimony came from Capt. Paul

outside the 'hamber that the colli

Survivors who would discuss the
matter w ere a creed that it was due
to a combination of swift currents,
which carried the tug 01T Its course

and the darkness, which was to be
the DeutsvJiland's medium of safety,
but which instead prevented ready

"The Twelve Pound Iock." by

of the works of that author. Mme.

interpretation of music will Rive a
reading of the play. In her unique
conception of dramatic values she
has gained a fame that has been
carried with her into every state in

every province in Canada.
The playlet that will be read if

Trevino, commander of the Carranza

Chihuahua is defended by only

according to these reports. Yillistas
in large numbers are operating only
a few miles from the city, which
virtually is at their mercy.
Tre ino. it was said. plans to
join forces with Gen. Murguia and
take the field against the Villistas
who are moving asainst Torreon
preparatory to invading Durango
with the help of Zapatistas. Junc
ture with the Murguia forces appears
to be difficult because the roäd of
the latter north from Kscalon is
blocked by Villistas.
Heady to Dert.
Federal agents here who are in
close touch with the situation pre
dict a defection of Trevino's troops
to Villa. Their loyalty, long under
suspicion, is said to have been made
all the more doubtful by failure to
pay them in gold or silver instead
of Carranza paper money.
Friends of Gen. Trevino wer
advised to leave the city before he
departed. Chihuahua dispatches say.
Carranza troops are being rushed
north from Xaco to Agiia Prieta to
prevent a threatened invasion of
Sonora by Villistas. Four thousand
of the latter are reported about to
enter the state by way of Dolores
pass.
Charges that both Gen. Trevino
and the Carranza colonel at Sauz,
commanding 200 men, refused to
senl troops to engage the bandits
who held up a passenger train at
Terrazas for live hours Wednesday
were voiced today by persons who
were on the train and who were

They say that an appeal for help
