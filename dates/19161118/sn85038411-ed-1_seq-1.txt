Seven Ammunition Ships
Are Reported Blown Up
With Heavy Death Toll
Berlin, Nov. 18 (via wireless to
Sayville).—Seven ammunition steam
ers recently were blown up in the
harbor of Archangel, according to a
Russian newspaper published in Arch
angel, says the Overseas News Agency,
which quotes the paper as saying:
"This evening Archangel was terri
aed by an appalling noise. It seemed
that the whole port was aflame. At
6.15 p. m. seven ammunition steamers
which had arrived in the morning
were blown up. The explosion was so
enormous that iron fragments of ships
fell TOO yards away. The port for sev
eral minutes resembled a burning vol
tano and pieces of glowing iron fell.
AII the port establishments were en
dangered (deleted by Russian censor).
Thus thirty-seven storehouses were
razed. The damage is estimated (sup
pressed by censor) millions of rubles.
"According to ths latest statements
(number suppressed by censor),
corpses were found.
"Seven hundred and sixty-three se
verely Injured persons were taken to
hospitals. However, the number of
victims will be found to be consid
erably larger when the ground has
been cleared. Access to the port dis
trict continues to be forbidden."
Dispatches to the Exchange Tele
graph Company from fctockholm on
November 16 quoted a Stockholm
newspaper as saying that the Russian
ammunition steamer, the Baron Bre
cent, was blown up in the harbor of
Archangel, causing the death of 150
persons and wounding 650.

PEACE MOVEMENT
ABOUT TO ASSUME
DEFINITE SHAPE
Already in Touch With U. S.
Is Assertion; Call Soon to Be
Made For Conference
BELLIGERENTS SOUNDED
Reported Requests Have Been
Made to Them to Send
Delegates to Meeting
Berlin, Nov. 17, via London, Nov. 18.
—The movement for peace negotia
tions. according: to reports from "the
Swiss frontier." which were printed by
the Koelnische Zeitung is about to
assume definite shape in the form of
a joint call from various neutral gov
ernments to the belligerents asking
them to send delegates to a peace con
ference. The reports assert that sev
eral European neutrals are already in
touch with the American government
and that various belligerents have been
sounded on the proposition of a peace
conference.
In authoritative official circles here
it is stated that no facts are known
upon which the Koelnische Zeitung's
story could be based while it is con
sidered not impossible that neutral
governments may be considering some
such step.
Two Early Morning Fires
Cause Small Losses
Two early morning fires caused S6OO
damage at the Imperial flardware
Company and a slight loss at the St.
James Hotel.
Fire Chief Kindler believes crossed
wires to be the cause of the fire at
the Imperial Hardware Company, 1202
North Third street. The blaze started
in the cellar where a number of
Christmas toys were stored and caused
a |3 00 loss to stock before it could
be extinguished. The building is
owned by Sidney Seidel. and was dam
aged to an extent of S3OO.
This fire is another example of the
need of the city for an inside wire In
spector. says Chief Kindler.
The fire at the St. James Hotel was
started by a lighted cigaret care
lessly flung into a waste basket. A
bell hop seized the basket and flung
it through a window. The flaming
basket lodged on the awning. The
awning was destroyed.
Two-Cent Newspaper
Will Soon Be Universal
I Every means is being: adopted by the
(newspaper publishers of the country to
: meet the extraordinary expense re
! suiting from the unprecedented cost of
news print. Increase of the price of
1 newspapers from one to two cents is
•almost universal. All manner of eco
nomies are being resorted to and with
' practically no exception the public fs
i responding to the unusual conditions
, which confront the publishers,
i Co-operative purchasing of news
1 print paper by the members of the
i North Carolina Press Association lias
j been decided upon by the print paper
I committee of the association as the
[ only means of obtaining a supply dur
j lug 1917 at a price that will enable the
; papers to exist. •
i The plan which Mr. Varner and
1 others have carefully planned is
I for all to place their order in bulk
with the mills direct, eliminating the
I middleman, and thus getting the best
! price obtainable. The committee be
; lleves there is an excellent chance of
| this plan being put into effect and that
it offers what appears to be the only
j plausible solution of the situation fac-
I ing publishers.
Since 1909 eleven paper mills in the
I'nited States have ceased to produce
I news print and in the near future ten
; more mills will turn all of their ma
-1 chines to other grades of paper. r,educ
, ing the supply hundreds of tons an
j nually. Still other mills have par
tially changed from news print to other
; grades, which are more profitable. This
| aggravates the newspaper famine.
I The Kansas City Star has increased
' its subscription rate from $5.20 to $7.80
j a year. Scores of papers have gone
i from one to two cents per copy. Many
i Canadian dailies and weeklies have
i Increased subscription rates fifty per
i cent.

Philadelphia, i*ov. 18. Charles J.
! Roney, a former State representative
j and one of the best known young
lawyers in this city, died suddenly of
heart disease in a hospital here last
I night. Mr. Roney had been under

elected to the House of Representa
tives in 1910. He was re-elected In
1912 and 1914. At the last election
he again was a candidate but was de
feated. His friends attributed his
weakened health to depression which
followed his political defeat.

Palmer Stadium, Princeton, N. J.,
Nov. 18.—The elevens of Yale and
Princeton universities met here this

filled with adherents of the two institu
tions more than 35,000 being present
when the klckoff inanguratcd the con
test.
The weather was all that either
players or spectators could desire. A
] cloudless blue vault overhung the
j stadium from which hazy autumn's
| sun smiled down upon the gathering
with just enough warmth to temper
| the sharp wind that swept across the
amphitheater from the northwest.
(Wraps, sweaters and steamer rugs
i were popular with the spectators
I while the members of the teams prac

j beginning of the game.
I The throngs were slow in gathering
and both squads were running through
j signal drills before llie rival cheering
; sections swung into the stadium. The
I Princeton clan, several hundred
j strong, paraded across the campus
I headed by a band and gave a great

Asserts Farmers Under
Estimated Crop Reports
to Force Up Food Prices
New York, Nov. 18. An assertion
J that western farmers underestimated
their crops in reports submitted to the
; Federal government and thereby t'orc
jed up the price of wheat, potatoes,
i onions and cabbage is the latest con
j tribution to the high cost of food In-
vestigation here.
Mr. Hartigan's investigations con
vinced him, he said, that the govern
ment estimate of the wheat crop in
this country this year was based on
statistics furnished by the farmers,
who "knowingly concealed at least 25
per cent, of their wheat crops."
I>EXY CROP RUMORS
Washington, Nov. 18. Depart
ment of Agriculture officials to-day
deny the assertion of Joseph Hartigan,
N'ew York commissioner of weights
and measures, that Western farmers
knowingly underestimated their crops
in reports to the Federal government
and thus forced up the price of wheat,
potatoes, onions and cabbage.
It was insisted at the department
that there is a material shortage of
wheat and otht-r crops. Furthermore,
department officials assert the crop
estimates are not based alone on re
ports from farmers but from the gov
ernment's own tieid agents in each
State.

Vandals Ruthlessly Sweep
Away Weeks of Loving
Care on Flowerbox
The story of the ruthless sweeping
away of the results of weeks of care
ful, loving labor, some quietly griev
ing tears—and the uproariously funny
tale of some fun that made last Tues
day night joyous, related in pool room
or saloon —is summed up in a post
card which reached the Telegraph in
to-day's mall. The card speaks for
itself; it is from a feminine reader at
434 Boas street. Here's the story:
"Mr. Editor:
"Just want to tell you about my
porch box. 1 had a beautiful one and
was very proud of it. All summer I
took SUCH good care of it and gave
it SO much time and trouble. On
Tuesday evening some grown-up boys
or young men stopped for a moment
outside the house, pulled the box oft
the porch, overturned it—and ruined
all my plants! I did not see the boys
but 1 know they were not small boyn
because small boys couldn't handle
the heavy box. I just thought I'd
write and tell you, Mr. Editor."
