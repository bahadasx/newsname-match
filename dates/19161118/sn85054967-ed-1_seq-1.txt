Flees Before Russ-Rumanians.
PARIS, Nov. 16.—French, and Russian troops on the Mace
donian front are now within four miles of Monastir, it was an
nounced officially. The war office says the pursuit of the defeated
Bulgarians continues.
On the eastern end of the line British troops have again
assumed the offensive, defeating the Bulgarians in the region of
the River Strura and capturing the village of Karakaska.
During the night Bulgarians abandoned their principal posi
tions west of the Cerna river. The French and Serbians took 400

west of Monastir.

making substantial progress. It is in this region to the north of

BILLY GOATS SEE THEIR REFLECTION
IN SHINY AUTO, THEN WRECK CAR
Two billy goats belonging to Tony La Mantia, an Italian fruit
dealer of Homer City, nearly wrecked a new automobile owned
by Wendell Miller of the same place, when they saw themselves
reflected in the glistening surface of the machine. Miller had
washd and polished the car until it shone like a mirror and let
it stand in an alley near the La Mantia store while he went on a
short errand. Returning he was attracted by a crashing noise in
the alley. He found a goat on each side of the car making running
leaps and delivering smashing blows at imaginary opponents in
the machine.
LSVED ALONE IN TUMBLED
DOWN SHACK NEAR BIG
SOLDIER
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa., Nov.
16.—-George Ambler, aged 103,
pleaded guilty of selling liquor
without a license before the Jef
ferson County Court. He is pro
bably the oldest man ever as
signed before any bar of justice.
When he was called before
Judge Charles Corbet the old
man said in broken English: "I
can't work since I got my back
broken." Sentence was suspend
ed and Ambler is to be cared
for at the county home.
The old man told an interest
ed crowd of bystanders the
story of his life. He was born in
Theodasa, Russia, serving 15
years in the Russian army, and
fought all through the Crimean
war, was with the Russian army
when it was defeated at the
Tchernays while on its way to
the relief of Sebastopol.
For the past 15 years Ambler
has been living in a tumbled
down shanty near Big Soldier.
He slept on a bed of rags and
ate what he could beg until the
county went dry. Then he se
cured a little stock of beer and
whisky and has been dispensing
it rather freely until his arrest
last week. "I knew they'd catch
me," he said, as he was placed
in a rig to be taken to the coun
ty home, ''because I can't run
much."

THE PA TRIOT
TRAINMEN OFFICIAL
SAYS RAILWAY STRIKE
IS REMOTE POSSIBILITY
NEW YORK, Nov. 16.—Geo.
H. Sines, vice president of the
Brotherhood of Railroad Train
men, in a statement made here
today, said a railroad strike is a
remote possibility, no matter
what happens to the Adamson
eight-hour law. The brother
hood leaders, he declared, have
not even considered calling a
strike as an answer to the in
junction proceedings by the rail
roads.
"I don't think there is any
thing in the constitution of any
of the brotherhoods allowing a
strike during injunction pro
ceedings," said Mr. Sines. "If
the supreme court decides the
Adamson law is unconstitutional
the brotherhoods will be right
back where they were before the
law was passed.
"I doubt if the court decision
would revivify the strike vote
taken by the brotherhoods. In
all probability, although I can-
not say for certainty that it is
so, the unions would have to
take a new vote on a strike."
GERMANS MAKE GAINS
BUT WITH HEAVY LOSS
German forces have succeed
ed in gaining a footing in the
French advance positions in the
northern corner and western
outskirts of St. Pierre Vaast
wood. Progress was also made
in the village of Pressoire.
The Teutonic attack was car
ried on in all fierceness, use be
ing made of burning liquid. The
advance was secured only at the
cost of very heavy losses.
The British troops yesterday
consolidated the ground won in
their new offensive movement
along the Ancre River, and no
fighting of importance was re
ported.
MRS. HASTIE IS DEAD.
Mrs. Elizabeth Clark Hastie,

Mrs. Hastie was the mother of
Mrs. R. N. R.ay, of Water street.

PARTING ILL-MATED PAIR.
NEW ROCHELLE, N. Y., Nov. 16.—Mrs. Alice Pitcher Vos

Shakespeare today that she is a free woman. Justice J. Addison

" 'Youth like summer morn, age like winter weather.
" 'Youth is full of sport, age's breath is short,"' etc.
"Shakespeare was right," continued the court, "and I find for
the plaintiff. Next!"

Clyde Roads, fourth, 3:54:45.4.
Vail and Patterson, the only other survivors of the terrific
strain on cars, were flagged while running.
Nineteen drivers started the long grind over the 8,401 miles
triangular course at noon before an audience of thousands banked
high on temporary bleaches facing the ocean on the straightaway
and wove their way between two deep hedges of "standing room"
spectators that lined both sides of the course. Mechanical trouble
caused most of the withdrawals, Bolden alone suffering from the
dangerous turns. He skidded and out on the 31st lap.

WAR IN NEW WAYS
AGAINST RAILROADS
CLEVELAND, 0., Nov. 17.
"We have warned the railroads
that if they fight the Eight-
Hour Law we will, in addition to
striking oppose every move they
might make to better themselv
es," said W. G. Lee, President of
the Brotherhood of Railroad
Trainmen on his return today
from New York. He added:
"We will hire lawyers to ex
pose Federal valuations that are
favorable to the railroads. We
will fight any increase in freight
rates, and if that doesn't bring
them around, we will start a
movement for Government own
ership.
"Heretofore we have always
worked with the railroads be
cause we have considered our in
terests to be in common. But
the railroads have not recipro
cated."
HIGH PRICE OF FOOD
CUTS DOWN WASTE
MILWAUKEE, WIS., Nov. 16.
—The fact that far less vege
table waste is being received at
Milwaukee, municipal garbage
crematory now than at any time
since the plant was opened was
attributed to-day, in a statement
by C. A. Davis, superintendent
of the crematory, to the high
price of foodstuffs.
"The waste in the American
kitchen has been appalling and
the present situation shows
what can be done when economy
is the'first consideration," Mr.
Davis said. "Judging from thin
potato peelings observed at the
crematory, I suspect that the
tubers are being peeled with
safety razors these days."
INDIANS PREDICT MILD

seen, muskrats have not started
to build, fur-bearing animals
have thin coats and the bark on
poplar trees is loose.

FOR "AMERICAN XMAS."
Speaker Clark's Daughter Bars
Imported Gifts.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15.
Mrs. James M. Thompson,
daughter of Speaker Champ
Clark and National Chairman of
the Women's National Made in
U. S. A. League, issued a call to
the members of the organization
to-night to observe the rule
"America first" in their Christ
mas purchases.
"A Made in America Christ
mas would be a splendid lesson
for the youth of the country,"
she says. "It would teach them
that the first idea of industrial
preparedness is to patronize and
develop home industries. In this
regard women should show a pa
triotic preference for American
made goods whenever possible
and give all possible support to
the American industries. The
universal prefemce of American
women for 'imported' articles
has been a stumbling block to
American industry.
"Let us free ourselves from
the tyrany of the word 'import
ed' and write a Christmas mes
sage this year that will be a de
claration of industrial independ
ence for the Nation."
NO CLUE TO
MURDERERS
The killing of John Krisko,
the Bolivar resident, who was
shot in the neck Saturday night
when he went to his chicken
coop to see what was disturbing
his fowls, remains shrouded in
mystery. The state police have
been working on the case and on
Monday they arrested two Boli
varites, but later the men were
released, , upon their showing
that they could not have had
anything to do with the shooting
Mrs. Krisko, who found the life
less body of her husband in the
coop, said her husband had
heard a noise there and had gone
to investigate. Shortly after
wards, she said, she heard the
report of a gun and had seen two
men fleeing from the hennery.
She could not describe the men.
