POPULAR IDEAS Of DIAMONDS
- - . . . . - . .
A good many people think that a genuine diamond is neces
sarily fine and costly. Some think there are only two or three
grades of diamonds, like Imperfect, Commercially Perfect and '
Perfect; or Selected Medium and Common. That, is all wrong.
The fucfc is, as alt diamond experts know, that
Size, Color, Cut. Brilliancy,
And How Much Perfect
dictates the price and makes universal grading Impossible.' Come -In
and let me snow you fine quality diamonds at; f 80 per karat, at
$111 per carat, at $117 per carat, at $240 per carat and up.-
