Colossal Project to

LOANSTOBEMADE
WITHOUT INTEREST
Work on Huge Schcme to
Begin as Soon as
Pcace Is Dcclarcd
Once more have the Jews of Amtrica
poured out their aympathy and gen
eroslty toward the sufTering members
of their race ln the war devaatated re
glons of Kurope, this time with per
haps the most colopsal ffhpmo of prac
tical fnancial help ever undertaken.
Dr. Judah L. Magne?, who recently
returned from Kurope. whither he had
been aent by Jewish charltable organl
zatlons to investigate the conditiona
of war sufTerers, announced yesterday
thnt the Hebrews of the Cnited States
had undertaken to rebuild all tha
ruitted homc? of Jews in the war arena.
Tha work will not begin till peaee Is
declared. The money to nerompil.Oi
this great task will not be given, but
loaned to indiriduals withont pennv
of intere?t.
Dr. Magnea did not attempt to estl
mate the sum required, but it is under
ftood that the cost will run into a?v
ernl hundred millions of dollars. The
project transcends in magnitude all
previous war relief enterprises in thc
Cnited States. Just how thc loan is
to be obtained has not been decided.
Dr. Magnes aaid yeaterday that he
woald leave the cnormoiis organiza
tion of the loan to tha wealthy JOWI
of the country who have, in Uanket,
npprovi'd the idea and whw have
pledged thaajeelvea to rai^e the fund.
Will Raiae ( ities from Ashea
Whole villages, even cltirs, largely
lahabltad by Jtwi In Omian and Rm?
sian Palaad, LithiiHiiia nnd Galicia.
and ahot into raiai by tha greatest
armies of history swaying back end
forth, will be ralaad froai nshea and
daaolation. Beeraa of thousands, if not
haadrada of thousands, of Jews will
hc assisted to Mand on their own fatt
economically when the territic strug
gle is over.
The aid will not be confined to the
battle arena where the Teutonic and
the Baaaiaa armies have playcd havoe,
but to all other distmts Ia Europe
where tha Jews have aaffered France,
Italv. Raaaaia a?d Paleatiaa. Only in
tha Holy Laad can the work of re
h.biliutloa of loat fattaaaa begii at
once. Money will l?e loaned there to
marchanU, tradaaaaaa aad famara who
b?va loat theit eapltal ataea Tarhay
plaaged into the war.
In general, Dr. HagBes'i pUo follows
tha Jewish poliey of "Geaulath Chaaa
diai," which means "JUta of Loring
gindnaaa," and which onginated in
Roaaia yaara ago. This ariaeiale has
?praad to Hebrews in all land-. It has
found practical exareeaiaa la Naw York
and other American cmes in the Jewish
free loan aocietiea, whieb loai oaau
from $1 to KSOO Withont ir.terest. Dr.
Magnes is certain that the money will
be paid back by a gratcful and proa

FALKENHAYN GETS

Closing on Campulung
Railway ? Bavarians
Storm Height
I.ondon, Nov. 17.?The Serbian
army is driving forward along the
ridges east of Monastir. They have
advanced well beyond the Monastir
line, and are flanking the Bulgarian
positions on the plain east of the
city.
Pivoting their nttack on Iven,
which bes almost directly east of
Monastir, King Peter's troops moved
OMtWWd and northwanl to-day. A
. re.-t north of the town was carricd
by storm, while to the east their line
was brought clu^c to Grunishte.
French Capture Hill
ICaanwhfla, n'ong the heights
skirting the plain, the French con
tinued to make progress. Kefore
Yarashnk.lhe 1 apt Hulgarian stnmg
hold on the hills buttressing the low
land, they attacked Morfastery Hill.
Severc fighting followed and both
sides lost heavily. The Teuton forces
finally were driven otit.
On the plain the cavalry is push
ing along the right bank of the
Cerna. Negocani, east of the Viro,
has been orcupied and the front
brought on a line with the Russian
positions on the Viro, to the west
and four miles south of Monastir.
No effort has been made to con
tinue the advanre directly south of
Monastir. Apparently this move is
waiting on the progrets of the Serbian
drive on the heights to the east. The
AUied strategy seems to be another
of the flanking operationi that have
proved so successful in the campaign.
I'lan Douhlc Attark
The Serbs are breaking through the
Bulgariar, defences north of the Iven
Yarashok line. Once these positions
have fallen, the enemy's positions on
the plain east of Monastir will bc
turned and the Rulgars will be forced
to fall back. Then the Allies can at
tack the city both from the east and
from the south, squrer.ing the foe out.
On the Stnuna front the British are
earryiag forward the offensive they
bagafl yaatarday. The town of Barakli.
on the righf bank of the river. has been
captured. This brings Sarrail's forces
el?M to the Seres-Deminhlssar rail?
way. If this is cut the tirst long step
toward dearing the Bulgars out of
Macedonia will have been taken.
( n the rest of the aouthern front
there is little infantry aetivity, al
though the guns continue their duel.
It seems likely. that despite the late
BMa of the season, Sarrail will attempt
a thrust up the Yardar Yalley, the di
rect rosd to Nish. Attacked at three
points on the Macedonian line, the Bul?
gars would be hard-pressed.
Falkenhayn Is Closing
on Campulung Railway
I.ondon, Nov. 17. -Falkenhayn'a of?
fensive ln Northem and Western Ru
mania continues to reap imporUnt auc
resses. Besides advancing further
southward in the Wallachian valleys,
the Ormanic troops carried their
thrust to the frontier of Southem Mol
uavia to-day.
South of Tonberger Paaa the in- j
vaders to-day captured the village of
Liresht. almost withln etriking dia
tar.ee of Campulung. The capture of
Campulung seems almost ineviUble.
Besides giving the Teutons a grip on
itill another railroad to Bucharest. the
fa!l of Campulung will make possible
the junction of the forces operatmg in
this scctor with those raovinjr down the
Alt Yallev, to the west. A joint drive i

be the probable sequel to such a junc

Along the whole Western front the

people of Belgium, hope that American public opinion will
show itsolf, not only in a few shnrt days or weeks of protests

IiOndon, Nov. 17.?Public opinion
alone can prevent the enslavement of
300,000 Belgians. Germany has or
dered the enrolment of all males ove"
aeventeen for deportation To-day
Germany has 40,000 of theae con
quered people to do her bidding, and
the number is swelling at the rata of
2,000 daily. And on September 2.
1914, the German Governor General
of Belgium said: "I am not asklng
any one to renounce hia patriotic
feelings."
Belgium is a bothersome prohlem
for the German?". They have got the
country and want to keep it, but not
as an enemy camp. The heaviest
finea and the most brutal puniahment
have failed to cruah the Belgians'
spirit and patriotism. Terrorism
continues aa the first and last word
of the German code.
Campalgn of Terrorism
If Germany could get Belgium to
conclude a scparat* peace her prob
lem would be infinitely less compli
cated. Germany hoped to spread
terror in England by the raida of
Zeppelina. The damage the airshipa
have inflicted on their military ob
jectivea has been only incidental and
has not by any meana disheartened
the British.
Substitute trtave drlvea for Zeppe
lln raidn, and you have the Belgian
situation, with the same reault. (J?r
many needs labor, but tho Belgians
who are now being treated as alavea
aro merely paying the price of pa?
triotism. To find a parallel to the
preaent deportationa one must return

the men to accompany them aa
