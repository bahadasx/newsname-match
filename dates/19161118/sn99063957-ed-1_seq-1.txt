IS BELIEF
German Military Jxperts r$
of Campaign- In v $vlVania and RumaniaAllied
Advance Toward jnastir Continues Germans Claim
' To Have Recaptoied Mountain Summit and To Have
Repulsed Serbians
By Carl V. Ackerman,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Berlin, Nov. 18. The war is approaching a decisive
stage and the decision will rest with the campaign in
-Transylvania and Rumania. Such is the expert military
viewpoint here. As summed up today by a well informed
military authority, the situation is :
The triangular loss at Ancre does not affect the Somme
battle as a whole. Viewing all the war theatres, the
whole war has now reached a period of tension. The
solution is drawing near. "When this shall come depends
on the progress of the present fighting in the Rumanian
passes. We are making progress there, but the mountain
difficulties are greater than in Serbia. Once General
Falkenhayn crosses, my guess is the decision will come.
How long this will take we do not know but one must be
patient and await Coming developments.
Herliu, via wireless to Sayville, L. I.,
.Nov. IS. Sanguinary repulse of Ser
liian and French attacks on the Plains

Von Buelow at the head of German
r'fles, storming the. position in hand

Washington, Nov. 18. President Wil

ernment in proposals for the prevention
of strikes in this country..'"
Monday lie will confer with Judge

at the Inst session of congress. Adam-
son says this program will be pushed
mrougn immediately wnen congress re
convenes in December and that it may
be found inadvisable even to await the
report of the- joint congressional com
mittee authorized to make a searching
inquiry into the entire railroad prob

law, with labor ready to fight proposals
for settlement of industrial disputes by
legislation and with members of con
gress already divided on these questions,
the railroad problem threatens to seri
ously embarrass the smooth operation
of legislative machinery at this session.
lhere are as yet four proposals in the
president's program of strike settlement
and prevention to be acted upon if he
holds to his original program. Thore in
clude: The Four Provisions.
Provision for enlargement and reor
ganization of the interstate commerce
commission.
Approval .by congress of consideration
by the intersttae commerce commisison
of increases, when justified, in freight
rates to mlTt inch additional expendi
ture rendered necessary by adoption of
tho eight hour day.
An amendment of the existing fed
eral statute which provides for media
tion, conciliation and arbitration of in
dustrial controversies by adding a pro
vision that in case present agencies foil,
a full public investigation of the mer
its of every such dispute ehull be insti
tuted and completed before a strike or
lockopt may be lawfully attempted.
Giving the president power, in case of
military necessity, to take control of
such rolling stock of the railroads as
may be required for military use and
granting hiin authority to draft into
military -service such train crews and
administratitve officials as circum
stances require.
The president also is expected to urge
in his message that all arbitral awards
be made judgments by record of a court
"in order that their interpretation and
enforcement may lie, not with one nartv
to the arbitration, but with an authori
tative aud impartial tribunal."
Council's Recommendations.
Washington, Nov. in. Legislation to
prevent railroad strikes "pending a set
tlement of disputes between employers
and employes" was recommended' by
the Nutiounl Council of the I'nited
States Chamber of Commerce tnrinv. i
That the government take steps to make j
certain staoiiiation, improvement and
extonsiou of transportation facilities
also was recommended.

five Americans who fled for their lives
from 'Parral before the attack of Villa

on the west coast of Mexico yesterday.
In a message from T. O. Hawkins, su
perintendent of the Alvarado mines in
the Parral district, the news came dur
ing the night to the offices of the min
ing company here.
Numerous reports of massacre and
lack of information tor two weeks had
stirred anxiety on the border. Upon
recoipt of the message last night, tele
grams were dispatched at once to anx
ious relatives and friends of tho five
men. The message from Hawkins said
simply: "We arrived here snfely to
day." At the offices of the mining company
here, it was assumed Hawkins meant
only the five American employes of the
Alvarado companv. Thcv were T. G
Hawkins, A..W. Sf orris, Howard Graves,

Story Is False

Helen Keller, one of the world's most
famous women, who, it was reported
was soon to marry her secretary, Peter
Pagan, officially denied the report
through her companion, Mrs. Annie 8.

Mrs. Keller, mother of the blind wo
man, Mrs. Mncy, her constant comnan
ion since childhood, and Pagan himself
united in denying the report.
In a statement toduy Mtb. Macy, who
taught Miss Keller to sneak, said:"
"The story that my pupil ori'7 years
is to marry ner secretary or anyone else
is an abominable fabrication.
"I have been with Miss Keller al
most continually ever since I first saw
her in her home in Tuscombia. Ala.. 27
years ago and during her recent illness
and during that time she has scarcely
Deen out of my sight.
"Besides this, her mother has been
with Miss Keller ever since last June.
If she had any affection deeper than
friendship for her secretary or anyone
else we would have known of it. The
story that Miss Keller intends to mar
ry is untrue.
'Miss Keller and Mr. Fagan both
deny the story in every particular and
Mrs. Keller and I know no foundation
for it."

of the regiatrnr of ISoston he had made
application for a marriage lucnxo to

10 SCENE IN PRISON
Bg Chapel a Seething Mass of Shouting, Gesticulating
( Prisoners When Kay and Olcott Appear-Mlonvicts Make
K Their Grievances Known-Want No Policeman or Ex-
Sheriff Over ThemObject to Flax and Brick Workers
Being Paid and Others Not
Three hundred prisoners in the Oregon state peni
tentiary smarrting under alleged unjust treatment,
wrong methods of conducting the institution, and dis
crimination, yesterday afternoon faced tSecretary of
State Ben-Olcott and State Treasurer T. B. Kay in the
prison chapel and, in a demonstration that came near
being a riot, demanded a change in the administration ef
the penitentiary.
Yelling until it was impossible to be heard, and ges
ticulating in a way that undeniably showed their unrest
and determination to be heard, the prisoners gathered in
the chapel when they heard
visiting the penitentiary. The clamor grew to such an
extent that Olcott and Kay stepped into the chapel and
faced the mob which, regardless of descipline, rules, or
regulations, seethed there. They could not be heard in
the din, until finally a prisoner who was a leader held up
his hand for quiet.
. , ., . ... m committee go back to the men and re-
ine men uecmuu biii-'h uhu a io"
lenders speak. They told Olcott and
Kny that the committee of prisoners
tbnt was conferring with them in the
outer office did not represent the feel
ing, spirit or attitude ot thojnass of the
prisoners. They charged that this com
mittee, which consisted of Harry L.ovell,
editor of "Lend a Hand," W. R. How
ett and J. L. Dauby, was picked from
the pets of the authoritiea in charge
and they were "high brows" and not
in sympathy with them.
State Their "Demands.'' - !
Finally their demands took specific
form and they asked why men in other
lines of work besides that of flax grow
ing did not recolvo the 25 cents per day
aud they were told that in the flax
industry and the brick industry the
state received money for the product
turtipn nut ana in the. other lines the
state received nothing. . They were told
the legislature had appropriated noth
ing for payment of the men who dug
ditches, etc. '
They wore a unit in demanding the
removal of Deputy Warden Bherwood
as they alleged he had not treated them
well, and suggested the name of Col
onel C. E. d. Wood as a man whom they
would like to have for warden. Ex-Con-grcsBmau
A. W. Lafferty was also men-
tioned- , . tt'
secretary Olcott and Treasurer Kay
pacified the men as much as possible by
telling them that the man who woulA
be chosen warden would have absolute
authority to run the penitentiary, to
mako any sweeping chunges he pleased
in tho Bvstem, and to choose his own
subordinates. Only the board would
hold him. responsible for the conduct
of the pneitentiary.
Governor Withycombe was with the
other members of" the board ivnen they
went to the penitentiary and he con
ferred with the committee of three who
were supposed to represent the body of
prisoners. They presented claims prac
tically the same as the other group, es
pecially regarding tho selection of a
warden. When the conference was about
finished tho tumult in tho chapel be
came bo great that it was suggested the
