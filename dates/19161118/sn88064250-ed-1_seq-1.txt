"EVANGELINE HIGHWAY"'
MEETING AT COURTHOUSE
LARGE DELEGATION OF "GOOD ROAD BOOSTERS" HELD THEIR
MEETING HERE ON THURSDAY IN THE COURT
HOUSE
A large and thusiastic meeting
of citizens from Bunkie, White
ville, Washington, Opelousas, Grand
Coteau and Lafayette was held in
the CourtHouse at Opelousas last
Thursday at ii A. M. to promote
the building of what is known as
the Evangeline Highway Route
from Bunkie to Lafayette to con
nect the Jefferson Highway and
the old Spanish Trail which passes
through Lafayette from San An
tonio to New Orleans. Mayor Loeb
of Opelousas, called the meeting
to order and asked Rev. Father
Grace, President of the St. Charles
College of Grand Coteau to act as
temporary chartman. Hon. C. J.
Pope addressed the meeting and
stated its purposes, the body ;tha
went into permanent organisation
with Father Grace as President
sad Mr. J. G. Lawler as Secretary
and an executive committee from
aeoh town throgh the whict pro
posed Highwary ..is . aus witt be
Ianed by the President in a .few
dMys thus allowinw. him sufflnt
MAme to confer with those Interest
ed and witll rept at a mass meet
ing to be helddhare at Oplousas in
te court Hoeus on Dec. 14th at
!d o'lock A. M. This is one of the
grandest move ever made in this
parish, when we eonlder what a
model road is. dang for other
parish which are fortunate enough
to have a Highway.
Over a hundred representative
eitizens from the neighboring towns
were present *t the meeting in
eluding Bunkie, Whiteville, Wash
ngtson, Grand Coteau, and La
fayette. The movement was re
eeilved enthusiastically by all pre
sent. There is rather a sharp rivalry
between Washington,: Bayou Boeuf,
Melville and Ville Platte as. to the
location of the road after leaving
Opelousas, and hence the call for
a meeting at Opelousas on above
mention date, thereby giving the
those contesting points sufficient
time to prepare their claims to
show why the EEVANGELINE
HIGHWAY should pass by their
town.
Among the prominent speakers
at the meeting were, E. B. Dubisson,
President of the Opelousas National
Bank, a large land owner and an
Attorney of World-wide reputa
tion. Mr. Dubuisson is highly in
accord with the move and made a
very forcefull address advocating
the same. other prominent speakers
were Dr. Davis Hon. C. J. Pope, Dr.
Mathews of Bunkie, Mr. J. P.
Columb of Lafayette, and Mr. A.
Thistlewaiste of Washingtoi. Mr.
Mathews stated in his short but
pointed address that it was' istimat
ed that Tourist spends at the rate
of one dollar per mile. For instance
if a five passenger touring car
passes trough our town which is say
2 miles long, they will have left
here with us ten dollars and if
three hundred Automobiles passes
our little city they will have left
with us something like twenty-five
hundred dollars however, be that
as it may, should they leave with
us two thousand dollars, per month
and add this amount to our re
venues and we will soon realize
what a National Highway means
for a locality. Father Grace in ac
Cepting the nomination as Perma
nent' President of this Proposed
Evangeline Highway. delivered a
amss0ly speech, reciting histary
both encient and modern, as a proff
of what Good Roads have donr and
what they do for a cm.ltry. \\ ith
them a country will prosn"r an-t
on the other ha:i'! with oti them
how they dwindle down and pass
into obscurity, a matter of history
record.
This great project is of such im
portance not alone to St. Landry
but especially so for Opelousas, its
County Seat. It is hoped and we
know that a hearty welcome will
be given the visitors on day set for
meeting and hope that the citizen
of Opelousas will get out in large
numbers to greet them. It was
rather disappointing to note how
few of the Opelousas people came
out for the meeting. why, several
ladies from the little city of Bunkie
braved the weather courageously
and endured the fatiguing and
dusty ride through the country to
show their interest, their en
thusiasm in this progressive move.
When there . is a call made by
progressive citizens or set of citizens
to attend a meeting at which
matters partaining to the welfare
of the city, and country at large
are to be discussed, our business
as well as our professional men
should attend. None are exempted
from this duty. It is not alone the
duty pf the merchant to attend
meetings of this nature, but. it is
clearly the duty of paofesisonal
men, the lawyers physicians and
others. Why do we say this? Be
cause ,they are the reapers of
benefits accruing, the same as any
other citizen, nay more. This is
r .allt ale re piaded that a
call is issued in another column
of this piper, to attend a mass
meeting. or put themselves, out a
little and repair to the place of
gathering and lend their helping
hand in the best way they can.
The prosperous cities and towns
are those which boast of progres
sive. citizens. No city, or, parish
ever did much in the growing
proposition that had as business
and professional men, those who
hold back and say "Let the other
fellow do it" All alike, farmers,
business and pIirofessional men,
all must lend a helping hand, go
to the: meeting, have your say, and
give your ideas. This is the way
to build up a country.
Of course it is much easier to
say "I am tired to-day, or that
the world is treating, me well
enough, I am getting my share of
its revenues, or I dont need any
roads, I never go out, I may never
use them, or let the people do now
as they use to. If the' roads were
good enough for our ancestors
they ought to be good enough for
us, that is not good logic if you
stand by and let the other ad
journing parishes build their high
ways, linking their little cities or
towns with good highways, they
will draw all the trade away from
us Our people will learn its
necessities. They will leave the
bad roads and look for a place
where, when they do want to go
somewhere, they know they can
get there, without having to have
all the inconvenices that a bad
road will give. See how the
business men's leagues and unions
in progressive cities are adding
to their numbers. They are wide
awake, and their attitude is making
their cities grow and is adding
prosperity to .their people. Indeed
it is easier to say, I am tire I, and
dont feel well enough or I can not
aford to leave my place of business
to go, and the farmers may say, I
cannot leave my comfortable home,
neglect the many duties that re
puires my constant supervision,
and besides it is niuch more agree
able to be near my fire. But re
member while you are enjoying
your ease. your town, your parish

and your country at large is losing
something, losing your influence,
your counsel in important moves.
Proj)ably it is not only your town
or parish, but your own business
is being made to suffer. The conges
tion of population in great cities
is caused in a large part by the
lack of good roads in this country.
The reason that France is one of
the best agricultural country in the
world is because she has good
roads. There are many benefits
derived from good roads, besides
making it more pleasant to drive,
it will save enough of the money
now spent, caused by bad roads, in
repairing vehecles and harnesses
every winter to more than repay
the outlay for good substancial
highway, in the taxes that we
would have pay to build and main
tain these roads. It will improve
the attractiveness of rural life,
besides it will improve the value
of all the lands in and around the
routes -tihis preopoed EVAGNO5
LINE HIGHWAY. It is stated that
lands that were selling at nominal
prices immediately commanded
nearly fabulous prices, as soon as
the Highway is constructed. It is
nearly a matter of impossibility
to mantain our antidated dirt roads,
with the advent of the Automobile
which are always working havoc
with the roads generally all of you
who have traveled in this parish
in the last year or so know how
rough our roads are and how im
passable they would have been
had we have had a wet season in
stead of a dry one.
We are living in an age of
progress and sooner or later we
have to adopt ourselves to it, the
sooner the better. Take up your
history and read and yop will see
that as long as the powers that
were, kept their highways in per
fect construction as long as they
prospered. Take Rome, what made
Rome great, it is her good roads.
The facility of. converting her
soldiers from one place to another
in time of dangers. Take in our
own time, in the terrible war now
waging across the ocean, why can
little Germany hold her own with
powers far superior to her in num
bers? It is her system of Highway,
her railroad facilities. That Country
is litterally cut to pieceswtih HIich-
ways and other traaw *r: atit,n

GRAND CELEBRATION
IN HONOR OF SISTER
IN GRAND COTEAU
Grand Coteau, La., Nov. 14, 1916
Never were poets words so fully
realized, as on Nov. 13th. 1916, when
Sister Bridget Walsh celebrated
the fiftieth anniversary of her
solemn Profession. If the great
consecration was' made with the
exultant love and joy of youth,
how can we measure the depth, or
realize the sublime height of the
love and joy. that have been in
creaseing during fifty golden years
of prayer and intimate union with
Christ our Lord.
The ceremonies were simple yet
impressive.
The Venerable jubilarian entered
the beautiful adorened chapel,
while the sweetly solemn tones of
the organ voioed the sentiments of
the friends pretmit, and sounded
the first chord of the jubilant
chorus which was to echo through
out the day.
A crimson velvet prie-dieu was
prepared for her just before the
altar rail, and lighted taper silently
bore witness to the light of joy
and love which filled her heart
and was to find expression when
the trembling accents of old age,
i'enewed the consecration pronounc
ed in early youth, just fifty years
ago.
Asermon, most appropiate to
the occasion was delivered by
Reverend • Father Grace,S. J.
President of St. Charles College,
whose Mother for sonie years a
pupil of the Sacred Heart, had
been the object of the special care
and devotedness of the Sister
Jubilarian.
TIte rest of the day was spent in
receiving congratulations and many
tokens of esteem and affection
from friends far and near; the
most appreciated being the Papal
Benediction of Our Holy Father
Benedict XV, and the blessing of
Our Reverend Archbishop Blenk,
whom the dear sister had so often
served when his Grace, as a young
priest ministered so generously to
the spiritual wants of the St.
Michael Convent, Near Jefferson
College.
In the evening the young ladies
of the Academy gave a reception
and entertainment expressing in
word and song, their felicitations
on the accomplishment of this
golden cycle of fifty years.
This year of 1916 is indeed a
golden number in the annals of the
Convent of Grand Coteau, since
December 14th, is to commemorate
another golden jubilee, the fiftieth
anniversary of the apparition of
St. John Berchmans on the occa
sion of the miraculous cure of Miss
Mary Wilson, a young candidate for
admission into the order of the
S'acred Heart. She was dying, all
hope abandoned by physicians,
nurses, friends, when the Saint
appeared and cured her instan
taneously. Several witnesses of the
miracle will bepresent at the cele
hratinn and CGrand C~nteau Convent
will open wide hospitable doors to
welcome numeous friends, who are
most cordially invited to attend the
Pontifical High Mass, and other
ceremonies on the gala day of
Coteau's second 1916 golden jubilee.
There ane several ladies of the
world in Grand Coteau who were
pupils at the Sacred Heart Convent
when the miracle osutsed.
