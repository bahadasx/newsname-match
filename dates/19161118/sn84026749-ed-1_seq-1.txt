REPRISALS URGED FOR
EXILING OF BELGIANS
lagland Indignant Over Alleged
"Enslavement" of Men of Nation.
LONDON, rfov. 18,-England today Is
Making soma means of reprisal against
Oarmany for "enslavement" of Belgium's-
men.,
. Not stooe" the execution of Miss Edith
Cavell haa there been such a wave of
putar Indignation as that which Is
sweeping the country over fresh details
of the Teutonlo plan of giving employ
ment to the Belgian civil population by
deporting1 them to Germany.
.ft is realised that with the United
States rests the only hope of Interces
sion to prevent a clean sweep from the
desolated nation of all Its manhood.
Stories of fathers and sons parted
forcibly from their, wives and mothers
and other loved 'ones by' German sol
disry have served to fan Indignation to
a fever heat. '
300,000 BJen Affetced.
Three hundred thousand malo Bel
gians, ..above the age of seventeen, are
affected by the "employment" orders
from Berlin. So far at least 43,000 of
these have been transported from their
homes to Germany, that they may be
gtven employment, according to the Ger
man explanation.
The transfers are taking place at the
rate of SLOW a day. Information today,
reoelved ' via Holland, asserts pleas
avail nothing and that In several In
stances, where those pleas were more
than usually forcible, German command
ers ruthlessly enforced their orders and
In addition Imposed further tax burdens
as an example to those who opposed the
military machine.
The town of Tournal, It was declar
ed, had been fined 200,000 marks
($50,000) for "arrogance without
precedent" In thus opposing the em
ployment orders.
Copies of the notice to the Belgians
requiring their assembly at certain
concentration points for this weed
lag out of 'able-bodied workmen have
bfean recoved in Holland.
They vary In different localities. All,
however, promise steady employment
at .good wages and permission to send
money from Germany to members of
their, families In Belgium. Some
Sromtse employment shall not bo un
sr fire.
Although no alternative Is specified
in those ofAclal notices, Information
received in Holland Is that German
officers have backed up these notices
with verbal threats if the conditions
are-not accepted able bodied Belgians
can expect Imprisonment.
The mobilisation for this deporta
tion 1s proceeding with true German
thoroughness. .Men forced to respond
to the assembly calls are examined
carefully. Only the able-bodied are
requisitioned and exception la grant
ed to priests and certain town of
ficials.' The conference now In progress In
Paris between representatives of all
the allies Is looked to by the publlo
to formulate some action regarding
the Belgian situation. Word received
from Farls today said the conference
had already taken formal cognisance
of the matter and was debating ;t pro
gram, of economic and military re
taliation. DEUTSCHLAND HELD
IN PORT FOR PROBE
Only Slightly Damaged, But Must
Await Investigation.
JfETW LONDON, Conn., Nov. 18,
The German super submarine
Doutschland, In spite of Its collision
with the tug T. A, Scott, Jr., could
again attempt her voyage back to
Germany at once.
She waa only slightly damaged, and,
if repairs are made, it wilt not he
necessary to take her into drydock.
When she' will prepare to leave Is
something that will not be discussed
by' Captain. Koenlg nor members of
his craw.'. It will not be for several
days, for the Deutschland must re
main In port until United States
authorities have completed an In
vestigation Into the accident which
resulted in the loss of the convoy and
five of her orew at the start of tho
homeward trip yesterday.
Taking of testimony may consume
several days and the decision may be
reserved a day or so longer.
CapL Frederick Hlnach, the only
. man .aboard the tug, who was rescued,
r will testify today. He la agent of the
North German Lloyd Steamship Com
pany here.
It is helleved here that the accident
will be attributed to bad judgment
by Cant. John Gurney In steaming
ahead of the Deutschland instead of
remaining at her aide.

Mrs. Will Irwin Lauds Efficiency
of Those Left Behind to
Conduct Business.
NEW YORK, Nov. 18. "If all
the men were to be killed off,"
said Mrs. Will Irwin, formerly Ines
Haynes Qllmore, on her return from
battle fronts of Europe, "one gets the
Impression In England that the women
would be perfectly competent to-carry
on tho work of tho nation alone." '
A taxl-plrate at Verdun, making a
fortune out of war correspondents, was
a thorn in the flesh to Mrs. Will Irwin,
until she found out that the pirate waa
a woman, ony of the army of women
working In Franco.
Pretty and Plucky Pirate.
"That girl had a head as hard As
noils," she laughed, "but she waa so
pretty and plucky we couldn't be as
angry as we had been Vhen we
thought It was a man floeclng us. She
has organized a livery trust which
controls all the business of tho war

mourners. At our hotel not a dny
passed that some one did not hear ot
a husband or brother lost at the front,
but wo never failed to get smiling, per
fect service that was a constant mar

because they were bearing their sorrow
bo bravely.
English Hide Sorrow.
"In England they are even more In
clined tb hide their sorrow. One gets
a pretty little letter from a friend, who
Is coming up from tho country to spend
a few days In town, a,nd It will be so
pleasant to see her old friends again,
she writes. There Is no hint In the let
ter that she has lost every ono of her
six brothers in tho Dardanelles."
There Is one great difference between
tho women of England and those cf
France, according to Mrs. Irwin that is
a difference in efficiency In running
their countries.
"In England one gets the Impression
that If all tho men were to be killed off,
the women would be perfectly compe

said.

BULLDOG AND TIGER
UNLEASHED TODAY

Yale and Princeton Play Forty
First Annual Game.
By H. C. HAMILTON.
NHW YORK,. Nov. 18. Tho Yale-null-dog
stands a fine chance of losing an ear
this afternoon at Princeton; also, the
Princeton Tiger Is stfll wondering what
kind of a guard he is going to use to
keep the Bulldog from matching the
Harvard knot in his tall with one of
the New Haven brand.
It All depends upon the chewing or
tall-knotting abilities of the football
teams which represent Vale and Prince
ton. The game today will be the forty-first
meeting between the two rivals. Of
tho two-score contests which havo been
woven into history the New Haven con
tingent has won Its full share, and has
lapped over n bit. The Tiger has had
some mighty hard luck or poor football
teams.
Dope Favors Princeton.
Strictly from a dope standpoint Prince
ton Is favored to win. The Tigers are
better conditioned, have had tho easier
schedule, and havo. the best team since'
the days when Sam White used to pick
up footballs and humiliate Yolo and
Harvard with a single sprint over the
challc lines. ....
But It Is Impossible to convince a
Princeton student that a jinx makes an
annual trip Just to be present at the
battle between Harvard nnd Princeton,
and they believe nothing but super
natural luck will stop a Yale victory. A
rrnwd'uDwards of 40.000 la exnected In
Palmer stadium. Weather conditions
are excellent.
Yalo's Backfield Good.
Yale has a backfield which sticks
out all over the place when compared
with Princeton's. No men like Le
Gore grace the Orange and Black
training table. Neither are there any

In a statement today Mrs. Macy, who

or anyono else Is an abominable fabric.

been out of my sight.
'Besides this, her mother has been

If she hsd any affection deeper than
friendship for her secretary or anyone
else, we would havo known of It.
"Tho story that she Intends to marrv
la untrue.

Miss Keller and Mrs. Fagan both deny
tho story In every, particular and Mrs.

Fagan said that despite the statement
of the registrar of Boston that ho had
made application' for a marriage license

had never considered such a thing.
Miss Keller Has been suffering from a
nervous breakdown, and hod planned to

SEE ADAMS0N MONDAY
Author of Eight-Hour Act Says
Rest of Program Is to Is
Pushed Through.
President Wilson today Is prcparinjr to
enter personally the great thre-cor-'
nered fight between labor, the railroads.
,and the Government on proposals for
the prevention of strikes In this coun
try. Monday he will confer with Judge.
Adamson, chairman of tho House Com
mlttec'on Interstate Commerce, as to
the completion of the program he ad-,
vanced at the last session of Congress.
Adamson says this program will ha
pushed through as soon as Congress' re
convenes in December, and that It ma'y
be found Inadvisable even to await tho
report ot the Joint Congressional com
mittee authorized to make a searching,
inquiry Into the entire railroad problem..
Embarrassment Threatened.
With the .railroads a unit combating
the constitutionality of the eight-hour
law, with labor ready to fight proposals
for settlement of industrial disputes by
legislation, and with members of Con-
I Kress widely divided on these questions
me railroad prooiem threatens to em
barrass seriously the smooth operation'
of legislative machinery at this session.
There are as yst four proposals in the,
President's program of strike settlement
and prevention to be acted upon if he
holds to his original program. Them
Include:
, Four Proposals. j
First Proylsjon for enlargement'
nnd reorganization of the Interstate
Commerce Commission.
Second Approval by Congress 6f
consideration by the Interstate Com
merce Commission of Increases, when
justified, In freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures rendered
necessary by udoptlon of the eight
hour day.
Third An amendment of the exist
ing Federal statute which provides
for mediation, conciliation, and arbi
tration of industrial controversies,
by adding a provision that In caao
present .agencies should fall, a full
public Investigation of the merits of
every dispute shall be Instituted and
completed before a strike or lockout
may lawfully be attempted..
Fourth Glvinc the President pow
er. In case of military necessity, 40
take control of such rolling- stock of.
tho railroads as mav be required for
military use, and granting him au-
inuruy 10 aratt mio military service
sucn train crews and admlnlstratlva
officials aa circumstances require. '
Opposition Expected.
On all of these proslons, which
were embodied In his 'last message to
Congress, but which ailed of conoid-,
eratlon at that time1, the President
will meet with vigorous opposition,
either from within Conttres or from
without.
While official Washington does no!
anticipate a railroad strike growing
out of tho present situation. Congress-.
man Adamson declared today Con
gress will act adequately In the rail-:
road situation If It comes to a strike,
crisis again.
The whole trouble." he said, "ft
that the railroads want an Increase
of rates and haven't got It. They
were willing to give an elght-houii

how they're going to fight, because
they dldn'f. get It.

Chamber of Commerce o'f U. S.
Members for Anti-strike Law.
With new angles of the railroad cspli
tal nnd labor controversy thrusting
themselvc, forward dally, the National
Council ot tllo Chamber of Commerce

with the question today.
An .executive session of the council

the different remedies proposed In the
series of addresses before tho council

It Is the. 'feeling of leading members
of the Chamber that tho meeting hers

haa come. If America Is to bo a real
