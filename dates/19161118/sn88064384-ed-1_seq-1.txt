Speedy and Easy Riding
There's little comfort in most low priced
cars. You can't use their speeds. They
jostle you—they ride roughly—they
don't hold the road.
The $635 Overland is different. It is not
only the speediest of low priced cars—
But you can use the full speed of its power
ful motor when you need it.
It has long 42-inch, easy riding, shock ab
sorbing cantilever rear springs. In»addition
the 75 B Overland is a longer car—104
inch wheelbase. And it has 4-inch tires.
Its smoothness and ease of riding at any
speed would do justice to a much larger
and heavier car.
Come in and let us demonstrate,
the best kind of proof.
