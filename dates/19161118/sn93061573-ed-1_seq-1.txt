Effect Already ltehi(
Eelt Strongly
1 he effect of the new rural credit
law, passed by the I c 'latic Ad
ministration, already is being felf
in lower interest rates, alhniigh the
land banks have not yet been organ
ized. Testimony to this effect is
being given at the hearings held by
the Federal Farm Loan Board in
western cities.
At the Ticariugs in .Nebraska, num
erous farmers stated that interest
rates in the homcstcading sections
of thai State already have been re
duced from one to two per cent, by
t In prospective competion of the
thirty to forty-year loans that the
land hanks soon will lie making.
The average loan that an insur
ance company or other loan agency
would make on u tiiO-acre. "Kin
kaid" claim was $1,000. The com
mission deducted from this left the
farmer $850 . He paid interest al
from 8 to 10 per cent, for live years
on l,OO0, making his average net
interest rate from M to 13 per
cent.
The new farm loan act provides
means by which fanners can form

The loan is repayable is small an
nual installments, or can be paid
in full at any time. The estimated
interest rate is 5 per cent. The
farmer who borrows will share in
the profits cf the business, thereby
reducing his interest rate to a stilll
lower figure.

HARD
i Itanl-licudcd Rusincss Man Uses
: llard-lleailed Business Tactics
! With Eminent Success
Last sum r when Hi" I lemorrat-
ic lenders of the state were milling
around trying l find a suitable
loan to run for governor of New
M'-xieo and fiudinu: that the more
Ihey milled the tome confused :ml
up in the air liny were, there was
occasionally heard a suggestion (hat
if be coiil, I .e induced to mak. tin.
race Arthur Seligman. of Santa Fo,
would he an ideal mmlidale ami if
elected would make an ideal gover
nor. The suggestion, however ver
got very far in fact it was never
anything more than a suggestion.
Mr. Seligman was not in any sense
a candidate and no organized move
ment, in his interest was ever in
stituted. Furlherinore while wide
ly and faMirably known among bus
iness men all over the slate, his
poinieai tame was almost entirely
local to Santa Fe ami the adjacent
country, and such participation as
he had had in statewide politics was
loo fikr in the pat and of too in
eoiispirioiis a nature to lend any
considerable impetus to a Seligman
candidacy for governor. And so.
While everybody ablllitled Mini Ilie
Saula Fe man would make an excel
lent governor, the consensus of
opinion was that he was shy on
availability as a candidate, and the
matter of his nomination was not
given any very sJ-Vious consideration
It, is not known whether Mr. Selig
man has the gubernatorial bee in
his bonnet or not. or whether lie
a ''is eyt any political olllce in
the future, but it is safe to say that
with the record of nartv service lie
has made in the last three mouths
if there were nominations to lie
listribiited at this time he could
just about have his pick. For Ar
thur Seligman today is the democrat
ic hero. He has accomplished what
few. if any. besides himself, heliev-
I possible. He has shown himself
to be what the democratic nartv of
New Mexico has needed sorely for
many years and has not had a pol
itical strategist of the highest or-
ler.
Candid democrats will admit, now
that it is all over, that when the
slate convention in Santa Fe bad
adjourned last August and they had
bad time to think the matter over
in cold blood, they didn't see much
chance to elect but one man on
their ticket, and that was A. A. Jones
for senator. It was not that the
rest of the ticket was a strong one
