CENTRAL SPAN OP GREAT
QUEBEC BRIDGE FALLS.
Cnexpeeted accident delayed
the completion of America's
greatest structural project—the
Quebec bridge—Avhen on the aft
ernoon x>f September 11, the cen
tral span, which was being raised
into place by hydraulic jacks,
slipped from the stirrups tnat
held it and fell into the water.
The accident is the second to be
fall in the spanning of the St.
Laurence River at this point. In
1907. after years of labor, prac
tically half of the main span of
the bridge then being built fell
through failure of a lower chord
member of the cantilever arm.

briefly the novel method em
ployed in raising the span that
fell. The span was (if-0 ft long,
Ave ig lied over • »,< H >( ) tons, and was
intended to connect the great
cantilever ai'ni.» that project from
their anchors toward the center
01 the stream, their ends being
l -»0 ft. above the water. The con
Heeling link was towed on scows
to a point .just beneath the gap
a lid ils ends \\e,-e placed on i..
steel stirrups, one al each corner.
Two I OOP-ton jacks, at the upper
ends of ea"h of these four sets of
chains, raised the immense load,
2 ft. at a stroke, a dislance cd
about fi. when something win
wron'j and in an instant I lie work
of years was destroyed. The span
sank out of sight in 200 ft. of
water. If js now believed that
the defect existed at one of the
points where the snau rested on
rocker bearings, which in turn
transferred the weight t<> the
cross girders of the stirrups. In
the opinion of engineers, one of
"tirrups at dia^onaPy 'oppositt»
these bearings was fractured.
This shifted the weight. leaving
corners free to slip from under
their load, whereupon the span
crumpled and fell. A remark
able photograph «f the plunge is
shoAvn in the November Popular
Mechanics Magazine.
SHORT PECAN CROP AND
WHY.
Hurricane of 1915 Responsible
for Low Yield This Year.
When the hurricane of Septem
ber 29, 1915, struck the Gulf
coast, the pecan trees were load
ed to the breaking point. All
the frri. Avas knocked' off, and not
being r llv matured, it Avas a total
loss. Mut this Avas not the only
damage the storm did to pecan
it
trees; it also destroyed the crop
of 1916 and this is hoAV it was
done.
The pecan tree, like other fruit
trees, has two distinct kinds of
buds, the fruit bud and the leaf
bud. These buds form during
the period of rest, say from Oc
tober to March. The fruit hud
forms the embryo or germ for
the coming blossom and fruit,
which in some varieties of trees is
so distintcly developed in the
fruit 'bud as to be easily dis
tinguishable upon dissecting the
j bud. These fruit buds are to re
main in a dormant condition dur
img the winter and bring forth
6jthe blossom with the rising of the
j sapin the spring.
1 When the 1915 storm struck
the trees in September, it defoli
ated them completely, and the
trees being yet in sap. this sap
had to find an outlet. There Avere
no lea\es to take up the sap, and
it pushed out the fruit buds Avhieh
were vet undeveloped and should

very much on the propc
zation of the blossom.
I he pecan has a distinct male
and female blossom. The male
blossom appears in advance of
the tema'e and is in form of cat
kins or wormlike blossoms similar
to those of the live oak. The fe
male blossom resembles a cluster
of tulip -shaped uprkht little
flow
ers ranging in number from
one to six. YV hen the male fiovver
is in perfect condition to shed
the pollen and fertilize the female
•blossom, it sometimes occurs that
steady rains prevent the pollen
steady rains prevent the pollen
from flying and reaching'the "fe
male blossom. The period of eon
ceptive condition passes and there
will be a very small crop, if any.
This is in the vegetable kingdom
the same as in the animal world.
Of course there are other cau
ses of short pecan crops, but this
is one which has never been su
fficiently explained in literature
as to make it generally under
stood.
Notwithstanding the discour
agements of the past season pe
can culture the coming year
promises to show an increase in
keeping with the true value of
the industry. Taken altogether,
it is difficult to find a crop which
is as certain or is as able to Avith
stand the unfavorable conditions
as the pecan.
'Each after the damage done by
the big September storm of last
year, avc all saw a decided im
petus to pecan plantings. The
writer has noticed with pleasure
that each succeeding season there
is a greater tendency to effect in
creased plantings of the best
named varieties in Louisiana and
Mississippi. The purchase of
purchase
stock from reliable nurseymen in
sures success when a due meas
ure of attention is given to the
crop, and the trees will begin to
bring returns far sooner than
most people think.— C. W. Kieh
