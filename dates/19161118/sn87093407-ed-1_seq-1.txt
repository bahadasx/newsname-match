SEATTLE BUSINESS MEN
CALLED ON FOR SQUARE
DEAL ON PHONE RATES
Have you read the articles in The Star on gas and telephone
service and rates in Seattle, written by Charles A. Reynolds, for
mer chairman of the state public service commission?
There is food for considerable thought for every consumer in
Seattle, especially for every business man, in Reynolds' articles.
He is an authority on the subject. He knows well whereof he
speaks, and he reveals the astounding fact that Seattle has been
made the "goat," to use the popular vernacular, in the fixing of
rates.
The telephone company, for instance, receives a net per cent
return on its investment in Seattle which is twice as large as in
Spokane and four times as large as in Tacoma.
Seattle business men pay $7.50 a month for telephone service
and $1 extra for each extension phone. Spokane and Tacoma
business men pay only $6.
That is not good business for Seattle. <

RAIN."
It is just as unfair discrimination as the Union Pa
cific and the < >-\\ . its tributary, have shown against Seattle
and the Northwest in the matter of tourist rates. With the
aid of Mr Reynolds, The Star ha- compelled a hearing on
that matter in the supreme court of the United States.
THE TOURIST RATES
I here were those, shortsighted journalists as well as
business men. who failed to Intost for Seattle by fighting
for a square ileal to this city on tourist rates.
There were those who. failing to see the light, fought
against the humanitarian principles involved in the industrial
insurance ad. Yet that law was good business for it has
saved to the industries great sums in insurance premiums,
while giving injured workmen a better deal than they used
to get.
It was the same with the city light plant. What a storm
of protest arose from some of our "leading" citizens against
the establishment of the munv/'ipal project. Vet it has been
instrumental, directly and indirectly, in reducing the rates
t<> 25 per tent of what they used to be. saving millions to Se
attle business men.
So successful has Seattle's plant been that it is today
unable to meet the constantly increasing demand for business
and made application to the Tacoma city plant to purchase
"juice" there. It would have netted the Tacoma plant $40"}
a day without extra cost to it—yet Seattle's application was
turned down.
Why? Because the reduced rates made possible by the
Taconia city plant have increased the demands for service
in that city to such an extent that the Taconia officials feel
they must hold their surplus "juice" for new consumers of
their own.
How some of our "business men" fought the belt line
proposition suggested by the |>ort commission! Vet, before
our very eves, wc see the railroads now about to adopt \irtu
ally that same plan because, forsooth, Seattle business men
arc realizing at last the injustice to them in the present switch
ing charges -and are kicking.
MUST BOOST FOR CITY
W hat is the point? It is up to Seattle business men to
lx>ost for themselves. In the past, there were some moss
backs \v In» kept the business nun of Seattle from taking the
initiative in these very matters which were t<> their best busi
ness interests.
Seattle is entitled to a square deal today in the telephone
rates and in >;as service. Mr. Reynolds hints at public owner
ship li the present discrimination permitted to continue.
The Star is interested in seeing this city dealt with fairly.
It is unfair to tax Seattle consumers more for the same
service under the same conditions than in other cities in this
state by the same company.
SCARED OF "BUGABOO"
There will be those who will howl against public owner
ship whether it's good business or not. False leaders among
business men and venal newspapers have been preaching
against municipal ownership ;is a "bugaboo, just as they
(ought various humanitarian measures.
Hut it's time to remove the dust from our eyes. Whether
publicly-owned telephones arc good or bad must be determined
on the'merits of the ease and not on preconceived prejudices.
LET'S BOOST FOR SEATTLE—and the best way
to boost is to free the city from any discrimination against it.
