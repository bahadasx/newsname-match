Alleged Murderers Make Geta­

Harbors, Minn.
Two Harbors, Minn., Nov. 17.—
Search is continuing tonight for three
hunters, alleged to have killed Ray­
mond Simonson, Minneapolis.
In the hunting uarty with Simonson
were Fred and Walter Holmberg, of
Duluth, and Mr. and Mrs. Gustav War
ford, of Minneapolis.
The Holmbergs heard a shot, then a
cry from Simonson. They saw three
hunters, whom-they say tl^ey can ident­
ify, running, and asked what was the
matter.
"Nothing!" yelled one as the trio
disappeared into the 'brush. The
Holmbers came upon Simonson in the
agony of death. Finding that he was
beyond aid they gave pursuit to the
three hunters and followed them to
Castle Danger, whence news of the
tragedy was sent here.
Many farmers have joined in the
chase. Railroad men have been inform­
ed of the description and are watch­
ing. Sheriff Nelson is determined, he
says, to make an example of them.
Much indignation is expressed in the
woods because the men ran after mis
takingly killing Simonson.
OFFERED AT RAIL
Congressional Investigating Com­
mittee Will Begin, Hearings
Next Monday ..
HEADS OF BOTH BIDES
EXPECTED TO BE PRESENT
Washington, Nov. 17.—Some of the
suggestions the railfoads will make
to the joint congressional investigat­
ing committee, which begins hearings
on transportation questions here Mon­
day, were outlined today at a special
meeting of the national council of the
U. S. Chamber of Commerce, by A. P.
Thorn, counsel for the railroad exec­
utives' advisory committee.
Mr. Thorn, said the railroads would
ask for:
A federal corporation law for inter­
state railroads.
A measure enlarging the interstate
commerce commission and creating
regional bodies under it with original
jurisdiction in rate questions, subject
to appeal by carriers or shippers to
the entire commission.
Amendment of the act to regulate
commerce so as oreduce to 60 days
the present period of ten months dur­
ing whic hthe interstate commerce
commission may hold a filed railroad
tariff in suspension, a«d authority to
the commission to fix minimum, as
well as maximum, rates, such as it
alone has at present.
The national council had given a
place to representatives of the rail­
road brotherhoods in its program for
the afternoon, but the secretary an­
nounced that telegrams had been re­
ceived frpm W. S. Carter of the fire­
men and L. E. Sheppard, actin? for
Grand Chief Garretson of the conduc­
tors, saying they could not arrange to
be present. No replies to invitations
had been received, he said, from the
other two brotherhood leaders.
'Mr. Thorn's presentation of the rail
roads' suggestion was preceded by
speeches which brought the railroad
cight-liour law squarely before the
council. Representative Adamson,
author of the law, declared he believ
ed it constitutional, but thought con­
gress would enact supplementary leg­
islation before the congressional in­
vestigating committee reports, to
make impossible another situation
such as confronted the nation when
the brotherhoods threatened to
strike. Mr. Adamson said he was op­
posed to government ownership of
railroads and to the abolishment or
curtailment of the powers of state
railroad commissioners by putting all
rate-maiking power in the hands of
the interstate commerce commission.
BUILDING NEARLY COMPLETED.
The handsome new brick structure
of the Missouri Valley Motor com­
pany, being erected in Seventh and
Main streets, is nearing completion.
When finished it will be one of the
fittest buildings in the city.

THIRTY-SIXTH YEAR, NO. 878 (NEWS OF THE WORLD) BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA, SATURDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 18, 1916
OF
By FREDERICK M. KERBY.
Washington, Nov. 17.—Who will
control the next house of representa­
tives? The answer lies in the attl
tude of fivo members of the house
who are not affiliated with either the
Democratic or Republican parties.
They are: Charles H. Randall
Prohibitionist, of the Ninth Califor
nia district Whit P. Martin, Progres
Hive-protectionist,
of Louisiana Tho
mas I). Schall, Progressive, of. Min­
nesota Alvan T. Fuller, independent
of Massachusetts, and Meyer Lon
don, Socialist member from New
York.
'•latest figures on the election of
merhbers of the house apparently give
the Republicans '217 votes, and the
Democrats, 21$.*'.
Randall o!' /California aligns him
self with the Democrats.
Representative Martin of ILouisiana
is -a Domhcrat except on the subject
of prot^tion. The Democrats now
have refeed jlie sugar tariff -to -$uit
him anefnis district, arid he has no
excuse for doing anything except sup
port that party in the house.
Alvan Fuller of Massachusetts en
tere^ the race against a Republican
Roberts, in the Ninth Massachusetts
district, and was elected by Demo
cratic and Progressive votes. He
absolutely independent in politics, but
would not under any circumstances
line up with the old guard Republi
cans.
Thomas I). Schall of Minneapolis
leans toward the Republicans. His
action, however, is uncertain. Schall
is a blind man now about to serve his
second term. His first election was
due largely to his wife' campaigning.
This shows a line-up of 217 Repub
licans, against 216 Democrats, with
Schall and London unaccounted for.
If Schall drops into the Democratic
line-up on organization of the house
the lone Socialist will be able to de
cide the course of legislation for two
years to come.
DEPOSING OF UK

London, N'ov. 17.—In a statement
made to the Associated Press today,
Lord Robert Cecil, minister of war
trades, uttered a vigorous protest
against Germany's deportation of Bel­
gians, and declared the people of
France and England, no less than the
people of Belgium, "hope that Amer­
ican public opinion will show itself,
not only in a few days or weeks of
protest, and criticisms, but in steady
pressure upon the invaders of Bel­
gium, to conduct the war against, the
soldiers of the Allies in the trenches,
and not against the helpless civilians,
whom they have in their power."
Lord Robert reviewed the measures
taken by the Entente Allies to pro­
vide relief for the Pelgians and char­
acterized as a "lie" what he termed
Germany's attempt to justify its ac­
tion .by saying England was responsi­
ble for unemployment in Belgium.
General Trevino Says Time
To Take Offensive Against
Villa Is Close At Hand
Chihuahua City, Nov. 17.—Prior to
leaving Chihuahua City to take the
field against Villa, General Trevino
made a statement today to the Asso­
ciated Press, in which he said the time
for defensive measures against the
bandits had passed, and a vigorous of­
fensive was necessary.
"The state capital of Chihuahua has
been officially fortified," General Tre­
vino said, "and with the garrison I
have left under the command of Gen­
eral Cuellar, it is able to repulse even
a strong enemy force," the General
added.
"Decisive results could not be ob­
tained by sending small detachments
against the bandits, and it is for that
reason that I am starting an offensive
under my personal command. My di­
vision is composed of several thousand
men of the three arms, cavalry, artil­
lery and infantry, with plenty of am­
munition, and I am taking the field
with the firm resolution of delivering
this region from the elements that
have defied human laws."

D.,. Nov. 17.—^Infonna
tion accepted as reliable was brought
to Fargo manufacturers yesterday
that Charles W. Bleick of Elgin
would be chairman of the new board
of state railroad commissioners
Sam Andahl of Lltchville and M. P.
Johnson of Tolley are the other mem­
bers of the new board.
With this information also comes
the report that the Fargo Manufac­

Gibbs Has Mass of Data.
F. O. Gibbs, rate expert for the
Commercial club, has prepared a
mass of data for 'the freight hearing
and announced yesterday that within
a few days, acting under direction of
the local manufacturers' association,
he will make public some of the ma­
terial in his brief which he has al­
ready prepared.
Declaring that freight rates into
Fargo are in many instances 50 per
cent higher than in Minnesota, tho
manufacturers of this city will maike
every attempt possible to get a read­
justment of haul handicaps under
which they now declare they are con­
ducting business. Evidence in the
form of comparative tariffs will be
introduced, along with a long line of
detailed evidence showing the situa­
tion to Fargo shippers—distinstly un­
fair as regards competition.
Local manufacturers expressed
pleasure yesterday at the announce­
ment of the board's probable chair­
man. They declare Bicick, at least,
may be counted upon as a sympathet-,
ic listener, since he is in a position
to well appreciate the position in
which they have been placcd by rail­

sitting in Washington were presented
to Commissioner McChord of the in­

tonight, by a special committee ap­
pointed by the American Railway as­
sociation to confer with him.
Mr. McChord extended his tenta­
tive approval to the plan, which will
be put before the interstate com­
merce commission at once. The hear­
ings, which have been in progress
here in connection with an investiga­
tion by the interstate commerce com­
mission into the methods of exchange
and return of freight cars by the rail­
roads, will probably be brought to a
close next Tuesday night. Commis­
sioner McChord will then, it is under­
stood. leave at once for Washington,
to meet with the committee of rail­
road representatives which have been
appointed to sit there. This commit­
tee, which has been given practically
pecuniary power by the American
Railway association to enforce or
modify the existing car service rules,
will remain in Washington as long
as the interstate commerce commis­
sion feels there is any occasion for
their presence.
