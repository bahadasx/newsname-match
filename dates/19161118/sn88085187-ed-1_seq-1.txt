BREAD TRUST WHIPPED, SAYS MAYOR FAWCETT
THREE DEAD IN RACE CRASH
BELGIANS
ENSLAVED
IS CHARGE
« I nil- .1 Preaa I >-i,-.«-.l Hirr.i
LONDON, Nov. 18. —Kng-
land is today seeking some
means of reprisal against
(iermany for "enslavement"
of Belgium's men.
Not since the execution of Miss
Edith Cavell has there been such
a wave of popular indignation ps
that which is .weeping the coun
try over fresh details of the Teu
tonic plan of Riving employment
to the Belgian civil population by
deporting them to Germany.
It Is realized that v.ith the
United States rests the only hope
of Intercession to prevent a clean
sweep from the desolated nation
o? ali Its manhood.
•inn. too Affected.
Stories of fathers and sons
parted forcibly from their wiv_s
and mothers and other loved on°s
by German soldiery have served
to fan it into a fever heat.
Three hundred thousand male
Belgians above the age of 17 are
affected by the "employment" or
ders from Berlin.
So far at least 4r>,000 of these
have been transported from their
homes to Germany, that tlicy may
be given employment, according
to the German explanation. The
transfers are taking place at the
rate of 2,000 a day.
Town Fined $50,000.
Information today received by
way of Holland asserts that pleas
avail nothing and that In several
instances, where those pleas were
more than usually forcible, Ger
man commanders ruthlessly in
forced their orders and in addi
tion, imposed further tax burdens
as an example to those who op
posed the military machine.
The town of Totirnai, it was de
clared, had been fined ,50,000 for
"arrogance without precedent" In
thus opposing the employment or
ders.
Copies of the notice to Belgians
requiring their essembly at cer
tain concentration points for this
weeding out of able-bodied work
men have been received In Hol
land.

KELLY IS
SURE, HE
ASSERTS
Guy E. Kelly denied Saturday
that he ever made the threat that
at the next session of the legisla
ture he would "put the referen
dum to sleep so that It never could
be used again."
This alleged threat of Kelly's
was reported to the labor unions
of Tacoma at their Thursday cele
bration of the defeat cf all the
referendum measures, by Miss
Lucy R. Case, secretary of tlie
joint legislative committee of the
Farmers' Grange, Farmers' union
am! State Federation of Labor.
Kelly Saturday accused Miss
Case of deliberately misquoting
him.
What He Did Hay.
"What I did say," he declared,
"was that the seven ivferendum
measures defeated by the voters
in the last election, were dead for
all time, and that it i iiould be
ridiculous for the state legislature
to attempt to adopt measures on
which the people of the i.tate had
put, their stamp of disaoproval."
The statement was made at
Thursday's union meeting that
the joint legislative committer-,
would be kept intact and that a
closer watch than ever before
would be kept on the legislature.
Says He llm. 03.
In answer to a statement In the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer Satur
day questioning the claim of Kel
ly to pledges from 62 mebers of
tho house In his race for speaker,
Kelly replied that he had not only
C 2, but 63 pledges definitely.
The P.-I. stated that "one dis
turbing feature of Kelly's candi
dacy is that Elmer I. Halsey, of
Asotin county, veteran of five ses
sions, will endeavor to round up
a few votes In eastern Washing
ton in his own behalf."
Kelly is as positive as ever of
enough pledges to assure him the
speakership.

IS-CENT
LOAF IS
FAILURE
Getting his Information first
hand, Mayor Fawcett spent three
hours Saturday morning visiting
groceries and bakeries in Taeoma,
weighing loaves of bread that he
found on sale, and interviewing
tho salesmen.
"1 found that Tacoma has al
ready whipped the bread trust,"
was the mayor's report.
"All of the non-trust bakers
are selling large loaves of bread
a"; reasonable prices, and are con
fining themselves to tlie live and
10-cent sizes.
There Is utterly no demand for
the I .".-cent loaves, and they are
being taken off the market rapid
ly.
Baking Own Bread.
"Most of the baiters have re
turned to tho standard of selling
10-oiince loaves at 5 cents and 31
ounce loaves for 1 0 tents.
"What I want all bakers to do
Is to establish a similar scale,
with the added indiicemnt of of
fering six five-cent lctves for a
quarter, or three 10-cent loaves
for that amount.
"The grocers told me that the
bottom had fallen out of the mar
ket for trust bread.
"The people are baking their
own bread. And those who have
to rely on baker's bread, ure
shunning the trust."
In some places Fawett found
the loaves were even larger than
ho had asked. In some stores
bread Is being sold at 4 and 8
cents.
Whipped, He Hays.
Housewives telephoned the
mayor every few minutes Satur
day morning asking him the
names of non-trust bakerß.
"We don't want to patronize
the trust, but we have no way of
knowing which bakeries are in
the organization," said one of the
women.
"I will not have to sell munici
pal bread," said the mayor. "The
trust Is whipped already."
