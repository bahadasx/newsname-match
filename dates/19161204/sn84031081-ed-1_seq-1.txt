Washington, Dec. 3. Thfc Sixty
fourth congress will reconvene ut
noon tomorrow for its second session
which will end with tho lilo of the
present congress on March 4. The
administration, although assured of
control for four years more in all
branches, excepting possibly the house
of representatives, hits an ambitious
legislative program, all of which can
not he crowded Into the next three
months.
Where tho administration is to
draw the line on general legislation
has not been determined. Tarty con
ferences outline the program to be
attempted in addition to the appropri
ation bills which must be passed to
meet expenditures of government for
the fiscal year 1917-1918.
When congress adjourned last Sep
tember, tho democratic senate cau
cus agreed that the Immigration bill,
with its oft-vetoed literacy test, would
b taken u and .passed before con
sideration of any other legislation.
It also had agreed to act on the Owen
corrupt practices bill, a measure to
limit expenditures in national politi
cal campaigns and to provide now
Penalties for election frauds. Itoth
measures had been pressed at the end
of the session, to the embarrassment
of both parties, and were abandoned
by mutual consent despite the urgent
demands of a few members.

committee created by congress to in

the dominating feature of tho session.
In view of the, probability that the

The encircling movement of the

liucharest, although the Rumanians
are stiffening their defense.
The Teutons have crossed tho Ar

have forced the retirement of the
Teutons and taken prisonos and
booty. I'.erlin fays that here a Ru

heavy casualties.
Hard fighting continues along the
border of Ilukowina, with both sides
claiming the advantage.
On none of the other fronts has

Berlin, Dec. 3 (via Wireless to
Tueckcrton, N. J.) "After five
months of the bloodiest of combats,"
says the Overseas News agency, "the
Somme offensive at no place has ad
vanced beyond ten kilometers. This
success was attained in July, south
of the Somme. Then the French
conquered La Maisonette. Since this
time, the offensive has ceased at this
place. No further advance could be
made.
"North of the Somme, the advance
was slower but steadier. On July 10,
fighting was going on about Contal
muison. After sanguinary battles, the
rtritish. assisted bv the French, fin
ally succeeded in September, in ad
vancing as far as the I return, during
the first days in July. The Germans
have baited all further advances. The
recent insignificant gains of terrain
cannot be measured by kilometers,
hut by meters. Of course, through a
big concentration, an attack can pusn
back the offenders at isolated and
narrowly limited places such as the
British did on the Ancro in Novem
ber. Not one of their objects, how
ever, was attained. Nobody, not even
on the entente side, believes any
longer that the German front can be
broken.
"The great offensive which has cost
tho western powers 800,000 to 900,000
men, has been stifled in blood and
mud. The battle on the Somme was
started with gigantic fresh armies,
with war machines ami the ammuni
tion of two parts of the world, will
continue in history as the heaviest en-
tenter defeat. It means a Gallipoii on
the continent."

Juarez, Mex., Dec. 3. K'arranza
forces were again in control of Chi
huahua City today and Villa had fled
to the mountains to the west of the
capital city, It was announced today
by Gen. Francisco Gonzales, Carran
ra commander here.
Gen. Francisco Murguia, the Car
ranza commander, who has been
moving slowly northward from Tor
reon, was also reported to have en
tered the citv today after having de
feated the Villa column thirty miles
south of Chihuahua City.
Cavalry Force I Inters City.
Gen. Carlos Ozuna, the cavalry
commander, wh( has been charging
the rebel, lines at Nombre de Dios and
the northern suburbs of Chihuahua,
succeeded in entering the city yester
day evening at 7 o'clock, and has re
established telegraphic communica
tion with tho border. Ho made a
brief official report to General Gon
iiales here- who is his superior officer,
and then proceeded into the heart of
the city on an exploring expedition,
and was expected to report by tele
graph lute tonight or early tomorrow
on the present conditions in tho capi
tal, the losses to both sides and the
fate of the Americans and other for
eigners In the city.
Villa ltd feats by Train.
Tho battle between the forces of
Murguia and bandits took place Fri
day and was believed to huve com
pletely routed t he to Villa forces in
that district, and to have sent them
toward the west, in which direction
Villa and his stuff are said to have
gone on special trains.
Six trains entered Chihuahua Cit.v
today from tho south and were be
lieved here to have carried the re
mainder of Murguia's column, his
field equipment, and heavy artillery.
Telegraphic i omniunicatlon has been
re-established with Torreon and Mex
ico City from tho Chihuahua capital,
and the railroad has been repaired
and trains are operating " fir south
s Jimenez, it was announced here.
Meager Details or Fighting.
Only the most meager details of the
fighting which resulted in the re-occupation
of the capital have been re
ceived over the federal telegraph line,
which was operating all day to the
military headquarters in Chihuahua
City from General Gonzales' head
quarters here.
It was believed by Carranza offi
cials that Vill.d left some time yester
day for the west over the Mexico
Northwestern railroad, following the
two trains of loot which he sent west
after capturing the town and looting
many of the stores, according to the
reports brought to the border by refu
gees. Many of his men were said to
have been left behind when the trains
left for tho Guerrero district, wheie
Villa and many of his bandit leaders
have made their homes for many
years. It was reported here today
that many of the Villa followers who
were left, in the city were exonerated
by tho Carranza officials, when it was
learned that they had been Impressed
into the bandit leaders' service and
fought against their will.
Nothing Known of Foreigner.
Nothing was learned today of the
foreigners who were known to have
been in the city when the Carranza
troops re-entered the city, but Car
ranza officials here say they hav
little doubt these foreigners were in
hiding and escaped with their lives.
Neither had anythiag delin.te, beeft
learned of the whereabouts of Gen.
Jacinto F. Trevlno and his command,
which left Chihuahua City Monday.
He was reported to have made a junc
tion with General Murguia at Horca
sltas, south of Chihuahua City, but
none of the brief reports received here
mentioned his name.
Carranza officers here are confi
dent, however, that he escaped with
tho greater putt of his command from
tho city.
General Francisco Gonzales an
nounced late today he would go to
Chihuahua City wit 1 a part of his bri
gade as soon as a train could be ar
ranged. Ho will go to make a, per
sonal Investigation of the situation
there and to urrange for resuming
traffic between that city and the
border. His forces have been In
creased by the arrival of approximate
ly 500 troops from the Casus Orandos
district, which arrived early today.
Practically all of these troops were
mounted. The fear of Villa coming
to Juarez has apparently passed.
Cut Off Their Furs.
Six Carranza soldiers from the
remnants of General Trevino's com
mand were seen on the streets here
today with their ears out. They wore
bandages about their beads and piece.)
of medicated cotton over their mu
tilated ears. They appeared to bo suf
fering great pain from their injuries.
This was one of Villa's favorite meth
ods of mutilating the Carranza sol
diers at Chihuahua City, office
were sad to have been even nioro
terribly mutilated. Many wounded
soldiers arc also to be seen among the
troops w hich have at rived here from
tho south.
More Ttooh in .Inure..
The troops' concentrated In Juarez
were further Increased late today by
a train of twelve cattle cms that ur
rlved from the south, filled inside
with mounts and on top with troop
ers, equipment and women camp fol
lowers. Numerous tourists who had
crossed the river from HI Paso, gath
ered to watch the unloading of the
train, as the horses and mules, al
though small, occasionally put up a
struggle and had to bo roped and
dragged down Hie gangways. The sol
diers, wrapped up to their chins in
blankets and with hats ranging in size
from huge sombreros to small hats of
yellow canvas, looked as if just out
of tho mountains. Long strips of
dried beef were made fast to their
saddles, by way of campaign rations.
Peon refugees were busy today im
provising huts from the ruins of adobe
buildings near tho railway tracks.
The children of the Juarez public
schools gae an entertainment in the
local theater, featuring patrlotlr and
battle scenes, which were enthusiasti
cally applauded.
Villa Issues Proclamation.
A Mexican refugee from Chihuahua,
who left tho city after its fall to Villa,
claims to have seen a proclamation
issued there by tho bandit chief. Ms
substance, said (he refugee, was as
follows:
Villa called on the people to unite
with him against tho followers of
Carranza. In proof of his magnanim
ity ho cited the case of his old per
sonal enemy, Joso Ynez Salazar, say
ing that he released Salazar from
prison during bis assault yi Chihua
hua, on September lfi, and gave him
a brigade to command. Villa urged
the union of members of all parlies
to his cause, saying that it was only
against the Carranza adherents ho
"refused to repent'' that he reserved
his wrath. He added that he exclud
ed nil filibustered from his army.
The refugee said that Villa made
no reference to Americans or to the
massacre ut Santa Ysabel. or to the
Columbus raid,, which sent the Amer
ican punitive expedition after him.
The manifesto was said to be print
ed in the shop of F.l Democrata, the
leading Carranza paper of tho state.
