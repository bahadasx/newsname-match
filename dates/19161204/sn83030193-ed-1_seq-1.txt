FITZGERALD
His Four Measures Include an
Out-and-Out Embargo on
Shipments to Europe.
TO REGULATE STORAGE.
Use of Parcel Post to Be En
couraged by Special Rates
. on Shipping of Food.
By Samuel M. Williams.
(Special Staff Correspondent of The
Eveninn World.)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 4. Imme
diately on tho opening of the ehort
session of Congress at 12.01 I. M. to
day there were presented four bills
Intended to Mem tlio growth of the
hlfrti cost of living. The measure
wcro Introduced by Hcprcsentatlvo
Fitzgerald of UrooUlyn.
His bills are In brief:
FHIST Providing for nil oiil-nnd-out
export embargo of fnriu products
or manufnctuied foodstuffs for one
year.
SKCOND-Provision for tho Presi
dent to suspend exportation whenever
prices become extortionate mid the
public Interest reunites such action,
T1IIHD--Regulation nf cold storage
by prohibiting Interstate shipments
of foods, other than butter, stored
longer than ten mouthH, with distinct
labeling of the date on which tho goods
wcro stoied.
FOrrtTII -Abolition of postal zones,
insofar ns farm products and manu
factured foodstuffs are concerned;
admission of such goods to parcel
post In packages up to 150 pounds ut
thrco cents for tho llrst pound, and
one. cent per pound thereafter, with
slightly higher charges.
"PEOPLE WANT ACTION; THEY
ARE TIRED OF TALK."
Mr. Fitzgerald said, roforrlng to tho
bills! ''Tho multiplying evidences of
widespread Interest In tho lilKh cost of
Jiving makes mo hopeful of their sue
cms. Tho enactment of either of tho
embargo' bills and thoso regulating
shlpmonts of colli storage, foods ami
cheaper parcel post chnrges will bring
immedlato relief to tho country. Tho
poople want action; they are, heartily
tired of talk anil Investigations."
Thcro were predictions that all the
animosities moused last session by
the Mcl.emoro resolution warning
Americans of foielgn shipments
would bo endangered again by the
Fitzgerald measures. They wero de
nounced by Homo as distinctly un
neutral. They were praised by others
as a means of cheapening food costs.
They were opposed by farmers and
advocated by city men. They wore
backed by pro-Germ.ina and con
demned by pro. Allies.
Half a dozen members followed
Fitzgerald with other food proposi
tions. Lomberg of Minnesota pro
posed a Joint commltteo to which nil
food bills and resolutions should bo
referred for prompt Investigation and
report of concrete legislation. Parr
of Pennsylvania nnd rJmcrson of uhlu
proposed wheat embargoes.
Meyer London, .Socialist, of Now
