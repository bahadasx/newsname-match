MISS STRONG WINS
PLACE ON BOARD
Ann* Louise Strong enjoys
the distinction today of being
the only woman elected to the
school board In Seattle since
1(96.
Nathan Eckstein and Dr.
Strong were easy victors in the
Saturday election. The school
bonds were approved by a vote
of three to one.
Kobert llrldges was re-elected
port commlasloner without op|xisi
tlon. The port holt bonds received
a majority vote, hut fulled of (adop
tion !»•< anae the law requires a 60
per cent vote.
A WOMAN ON THE BOARD
Anna l.ouisc Strong was clected l»v a handsome
majority and will be tlie first woman to serve on the
Seattle school hoard since 1896.
To those who, living in a past age, view "with
alarm" the advent of a woman in public service, a few
soothing words may not be misplaced.
Cheer up, ye old relics, the world isn't going to
topple over your heads. You will find, instead, a
healthy, vigorous, broad-minded addition to the board
in Anna I.ouise Strong, one who is dccidedh able to
fulfill the duties of her position, and who will reflect
credit upon the city.

GREAT VICTORY,

WHO AIDED STAR
Seattle and the Northwest have won their
fight for fair tourist rates. The interstate
commerce commission at Washington, D. C.,
today handed down the decision, which, ac
cording to Charles A. Reynolds, former
chairman of the state public service commis
sion, "is the greatest thing that ever hap
pened for the Northwest."
Under this decision, the same round-trip
fare rates will be maintained on all railways
from Chicago to San Francisco, whether by
way of Seattle or by way of New Orleans,
El Paso and Los Angeles.
The rate heretofore was $17.5"
more by the Northern than by the
.•■'outhern route, altho the distance
from Chicago t« San Krancisco by
tfkv of Seattle van shorter.
