WASHINGTON, Doc. 4. ? Congress
assembled at in/on today for the short
session which will mark ihe closing
of President Wilson's first term.
With ? crowded program of IrgislHHon
foremost In which Is the. Presi-;
dent's plan ror railroad legislation, sen- i
ators and rcprosentatlves settled down j
to work as Speaker Clark and Vice I
President Marshall brought down the
gavels.
Today's opening was marked by the
usual flood of bills and resolutions,
many of which are expected to die in
committee with Congress itself on
March 4.
The energies of administration loaders
were at once concentrated on the
passage of big supply bills necessary
for the conduct of the government and |
upon a limited program of general leg
illation.
Speaker Clark declared the next
House on the basis of the last election
would show at least 216 Democrats
without Schully of New Jersey,
or Beakes, of Michigan. He conceded
213 to the Republicans. These figures
do not Include an Independent
group of four which with the two in
doubt make a total of 435. "We have
the control of the House without any
naubt," be said.
Four bl|ls designed to touch the high
- cost of living were introduced by Representative
Fitzgerald, of New York.
Two proposed food embargoes, one
Vfcl would regulate the transportation of
k, cold storage food and another would
t regulate the admission of farm products
and manufactured food stuffs to
, the parcel post and reduce rates on
t-y. foods.
"The enactment of either of the
bills," said Representative Fitzgerald,
"will bring immediate relief to the
country. The people want action;
they are heartily tired of talk and in
f vestigation."
A mass of petitions was wiled iu favor
of the legislation.
Senator Borah, of Idaho, announced
that he had prepared a bill to repeal |
the act which federized the National ;
Guard. "The federalization of Nation- i
al Guard has been demonstrated in the |
Mexican situation to have been a failure,"
said he. "it will be useless to
attempt universal military training as j
long as present militia law remain's I

Foremost is completion of President

the passage of the Adamson Law. Tiltremainder
of the program which the
President will press, includes supplementary
legislation to prevent such a I

NOTE
It seems that in the haste used
in making up the circular giving
the reasons why everyone should
vote for the Improvement Bonds
the item relative to Concrete
Bridge over the Monongahela river
was not made clear.
It is estimated that the bridge
will cost $350,000, of which amount
the Monongahela Valley Traction
Company is under contract to pay
$50,000. leaving $'.'.00,000 to be palu
by the city, and the bond ordinance
provides this amount and the
money cannot be used for any other
purpose.
