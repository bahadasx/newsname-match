Plans fop the most gigantic grab of, public moneys in th.
history of Bridgeport, to strengthen a political machine, care up!
against an. unexpected snag today when the bosses, preparing!
for the attack on the public purse, discovered an appaling con
dition of affairs in the office of the assessors. ' v .
. Prepared to instruct the assessors to boost the grand list bv
at least $40,000,000, in order that their ultimate recourse to the ,
legislature for the special law needed to legalize their proposed
carnival of expenditure, may not seem sd glaring 4he bosses,
found today that the accounts of the assessors were in such
shape , that it is extremely unlikely that there can be an intelli-t
gent levy of assessments for the tax list of 1916. V
, The block map system of the city, prepared at an expense
of many thousands of dollars, was found practically covered
with cobwebs. An accountant, hired to keep the set of block'
maps up to the minute, had not given it any attention for many
months because he had to do the worklwhich the four assessor '
themselves paid at the rate of $1,800 a yeac are expected . to I
do. .-. . . C ' : ' . ' . , ; . " ,
. This accountant has resigned, because he did not care to be
identified with the scandal he knew wa sure to follow the com
pilation of the annual list. Another man, hired to take.his place;
also has quit the pla.ee, and now a corps of young women is be
ing increased-out of town clerks being included in the reor- '
ganized staff to do the assessors'. work. . . '
On top of the disclosures of the
muddled condition of. "th assessors'
books it became known today that at
a meeting of the common council in
the near future a mass of "certificates
of error" will he presented .to the
aldermanic claims committee;
'.- These documents are to correct the.
mistakes of the' assessors' office, and
the list forrl915 waspy far the great
est in the in the history of the city.
The arbitrary order of the political
bosses of the city to the assessors to
slap $40,000,000 on the value of taxa
blep roperty in ' Bridgeport, coming
almost on the eve of levying the tax
list; -cannot but result in a haphazard
attempt to lay equitable increases.
The assessors, in theory, are working
from the spring until the. early fall
placing valuations on the city prop
erty, and from the early . fall until
Dec. 31 in compiling their figures.
fThe assessors are Julius W. Knowl
ton, Frank . J ' Hughes, William F.
Russell and Thomas . O'Brien, Col.
Knowlton is the dean of the assessors,
far advanced ' - in years. Attorney
Hughes, suffering from the effects of
an automobile accident, has not been
physically fit to do the duties of the
offiflce. : Assessor Russell has been
absent from the office for ; many
weeks, at various intervals, and As
sessor O'Brien, who was factory su
perintendent; has not shown the apti
tude for handling the clerical duties
of. the office' that would expedite his
share of ,th work.
The -result has been Rthat clerks, -
employed to do other work in the
office, such as keeping the block map
system .up . to date, have been unable
to devoe their time to their own du
ties but have been obliged to do the
assessors' work.

When confronted with two lines of
men in the county courthouse 1 this
morning Mrs. Garon was unable to
identify Edward Slattery and Henry
W. Welch, the youths accused of mur
dering Nathan Garon. In the pres
ence of Coroner Phelan, Mrs. Garon
inspected the two lines and said she
didn't think the guilty persons were
there. Slattery and Welch were
standing in the back row. A-num-f
her of courthouse employes and sev
eral men who happened to be in the
building were placed in line with the
youths.
Afterward when - the coroner in
formed her that Slattery and Welch
were in line she was, greatly sur
prised., Her condition was so weak,
however, that she said she was un
able to -observe the men .very closely.
Several times she became faint and
smeling salts were administered. She
was accompanied t- the eel-oner's of
fice by Dr. Home and her father.
When Mrs. Oaron testified before
the coroner she gave a slightly differ

because she did fciot scream until thf

youths who entered the store Lhad a

man told him Ke bad run into the
store and beat out the flames which
burst from Garon's. clothes after the
man had been shot! Flynn promised
o produce this witness for thfe coroner.
This testimony would indicate, that
Slattery was standing very . close to
Garon when he fired.
