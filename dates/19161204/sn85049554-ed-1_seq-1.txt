The force ot me converging at

strengthened.
On their defensive strength de

capital but-the safety of the Rou

London, Dec. 4.—Premier Aequlth an
nounced in the house of commons to
day that King George had approved of
a reconstruction of the government Mr.
Asqulth suggested that after today'*
business had concluded the house ad
journ until Thursday.
Premier Asqulth stated that the re
construction of the government In
volved no departure In any shape op
form from the policy pursued since the
beginning of the war. He did not deny
that the resignations of all the
tors wore In his hands.
More Vigorous Wsr Policy.
The decision of Premier Asqulth on
the advice of the war secretary, David
Lloyd-George, which is supported by
other members of the ministry, to re
construct the cabinet Is believed to havs
saved the coalition government again
ad insured a more vigorous prosecution
o? the war. There are some details yet
to bo urrargeel, but newspapers which
have been the most severe critics of the
government's alleged dilatory attitude
expressed the oonvlctlon that the pr»
mier will be able to announce before
many hours an agreement with his col
leagues on the vital question concsrnlng
the war council, the formation and also
of which led to the crisis.
Whether the council will be composed
of three, four or Ave members Is still
matter of discussion, while Its powers
also are the subject of negotiations. Mr.
Lloyd-George and his adherents eel re
the smallest possible council with pow
er to conduct the war independently of
the cabinet.
Monday, which usually Is a quiet day
in the house of commons, promised in
terostlng developments. In anticipation
of which the members returned to toata
at an early hour.
Acoueaa Constantino of Tresohery.
In the house of commons tod^y Lord»!
Robert Cecil, war tra&e' minister, said
the British government considered King
Constantino and his government to hire
been Involved in events in Athens and
that the Brltleh government. In con
unction with its allies, would take steps
to bring about a radical solution of -tho
question which had arisen.
Tho situation in Greece, said Lock
Robert, was one of extreme gravity.
iplte formal and repeated assurances
of the Greek king and government that
Lord Robert's- announcement has
given great satisfaction In London,
whero much anxiety prevailed.
Strong Feeling Agsinat Conatantine.
Tho feeling against King Constantino,
who is charged with having done every
thing possible to embarrass the allies,
has been growing here and demands
that some steps be taken to check his
activities have become lnsistont. Some
circles have credited the government
with protecting him because of his re
lation to the British and Russian royal
houses. This suggestion was Introduced
into the debate In the house of commons
today by Robert Lynch, nationalist,
who liad caustically asked Lord Robert
Cecil:
"Will the risht honorable jrsni'.ciss.n
give the house assurances that no mat
ter what occurs the dynasty will IS
preserved?"
No answer was returned.
An unfavorable Impression has beer
created also by the report that King
Constantino had recalled all his pro
Cerman advisors to Athens, and while
the news had been rather meager there
was a tendency to,, bell eve that tho al
lies had suffered a rebuff.
Greek Diplomata Resign.
The Greek minister at London and
the Greek consuls at London and Man
Chester have resigned, stating that they
wero unable further to Identify them
selves with the policy of King Constan
