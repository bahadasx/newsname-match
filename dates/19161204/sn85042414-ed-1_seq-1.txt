London, Dec. 4—An event
surpassing- in far-reaching
importance by actual mili
tary operations of the war
comes today in the public
announcement by the new
Russian premier, Alexander
Trepoff, that by an agree
ment concluded in 1915, and
subsequently adhered to by
Italy, the allies definitely es
tablished Russia's right to
Constantinople and the Dar
danelle straits. The exist
ance of this agreement has
been for a long time alleged
but never before was it thus
^publicly and formally ad
mitted.
'Simultaneously, while the
fate of Bucharest is still
hanging in the balance,
comes the news that Russia
which has been accused in
some quarters of failing, to
render assistance to its sore
ly pressed ally, is making he
roic efforts to save the Ru
manians from further disas
ter and to avert the capture
of the capital by the Ger
mans.
Allies All Agreed.
The semi-official news agency says
that In the duma today Premier Tre
poff read a proclamation announcing
officially that an agreement concluded
toy Russia, France and Great Britain
In 1915, and later approved by Italy,
"establishes In a definite manner the
right of Russia to the Straits and
Constantinople."
Premier Trepoff's announcement la
quoted by the nfews agency as fol
low*:
"For more than a thousand years
Russia has been reaching southward
tojvard a free outlet on the open sea.
This age-long dream, cherished in the
hearts of the Russian people, now Is

"From the beginning of the war,
wishing to spare human lives and

Unknown.
AMERICANS SAFE,
REPORTS SAY
General Murguia Defeated

Toward West.

Washington, Dec. 4.—Official re
ports to the state department an
nouncing the re-occupation of Chi
huahua City by Carranza forces Sun
day night, say that no resistance was
encountered and Villa and his bandits
left no indication of their where
abouts.
Juarez, Mex., Dec. 4.—It was offici
ally announced at military headquar
ters today that the- Carranza fbrces
have re-occupied the City of Chihua
hua having driven the Villa bandits
out. Telegraphic communications
with Chihuahua City over the federal
line have been re-established.
General Ozuna made a brief offi
cial report to General Gonzales, his
superior officer, then proceeded into
the heart of the city on an exploring
expedition and was expected to report
by telegraph late today on the pres
ent conditions in the capital, the loss
es to both sides and the fate of the
Americans and other foreigners ih the
city.'
The battle between the forces of
Genbra! Murguia and the bandits took'
place 'Friday and was believed, to have
completely routed the. Villa forces in
that district and to have sent them
toward the west In which direction
Villa and his staff are said to have
gone on special trains.
Murguia Enters City.
Six trains entered Chihuahua City
yesterday from the south and were be
lieved here to have carried the re
mainder of Murgula's column, his
field equipment and heavy artillery.
Telegraphic communication has been
re-established with Torreon and Mexi
co City from the Chihuahua state
capital and the railroad has been re
paired trains are operating as far
south as Jimenez, it was announced
here.
Only the most meagre details of the
fighting which resulted In the re-oc
cupation of the capital have been re
ceived over the federal telegraph line
which was operating all day to the
military headquarters in Chihuahua
City from General Gonzales' head
quarters here.
No Americans have been killed in
Chihuahua City by Villa according to
a private message received here from
that city. The message said the only
foreigners to suffer were the Chinese,
for whom the bandits showed no
mercy. Generals Murguia and Tre
vino were both in Chihuahua City, it
was said.
The latest reports here are that
many Villa followers have been cap
tured and killed.
It was announced that Villa has left
for Western Chihuahua following
trains of loot.
Many of Villa's men were said to
have been left behind when the trains
left for the Guerrero district where
Villa and his bandit leaders have
made their homes for many years. It
was reported 'here that many of the
Villa, followers who were left in the
city were pardoned by the Carranza
officers when It was learned they had
been pressed into the bandit leader's
service.
Nothing definite has been learned of
the present whereabouts of Gen.
Jacinto B- Trevino and his command
which left Chihuahua City Monday.
He was reported to have made a
junction with Gen. Murguia at Hor
casltas, south of Chihuahua City but
none of the brief reports received here
mentioned his name.
Gen. Francisco Gonzales announced
he would go to Chihuahua City with
a part of his brigade as soon as a
train could be arranged. His forces
were increased by the arrival of ap
proximately 500 troops from the
Casas Grandes district. Practically all
of these troops were mounted. The
fear of Villa coming to Juarez has ap
parently passed.
Six Carranza soldiers from the
remnant of Gen. Trevlno's command
were seen on the streets here today
with their ears cut.
Officers were said to have been even
more terribly mutilated by the band
its. Many wounded soldiers are also
to be seen among the troops which
have arrived from the south.

Good Fellowship.
See them come.
These are the fellows.
These are the men who are inter
ested in the North Dakota of tomor
row.
Wide awake, enthusiastic, progres
sive farmer-business-men, typical of
the spirit that made North Dakota
what it is today and who are the
promise of the greater North Dakota
of the future.
"Welcome—welcome as the guests
of the city of Grand Forks."
The Grand Forks Military band
blares the welcome in tones more
forceful than even "Cy" Poppler's
megaphone hurrah boys could hope
to do.
"Welcome—this way to the eats."
This is the invitation lettered on the
back of the mascot of the welcoming
committee.
"Welcome" Is the open seasame at
the Commercial club and at the Elks'
lodge rooms where great tables have
been placed and made ready to give
material evidence of the Grand Forks
spirit. This is the spirit that means
the closer relationship between Grand
Forks and her business men and the
farming community, a relationship
that is not one-sided, for the agricul
turist and the live stock man appre
ciate the progress Grand Forks is
showing and is ready to co-operate In
the spread of that feeling of good fel
lowship.
The Grand Forks Herald, for itself
and in behalf of the business men of
the Greater Grand Forks, adds its
voice of welcome.
All was in readiness early this aft
ernoon for the reception of the 400
North Dakotans who are to be the
guests this evening of the Commercial
club and the Merchants' association
as they are about to embark on their
excursion to Chicago on the Great
Northern Live Stock Exposition spec
ial train.
The general committee headed by
C. C. Gowran, chairman of the house
committee of the Commercial club,
R. D. Hickman, secretary of the Mer
chants' association and Frank D.
Black, business manager of the Com
mercial club, had performed their
duties well and were certain they
would have a large and. representa
tive crowd of business and profes
sional men of the city on hand to give
the proper welcome In as hearty and
informal manner as possible. These
men are labeled with large shipping
tags tearing their name so there
could be no need of waiting for an In
troduction as these tags say:
"I am Who are you?
SHAKE."
That's informal enough and it opens
the doors to an immediate ac
quaintanceship.
"Jack" Taylor and H. G. Harvey
have charge of the dining rooms and
have mustered in a corps of business
men who will Berve the tables while
the visitors are enjoying themselves.
There will be no formalities at the
tables either. It will be good fellow

Democratic Majority Too
Doubtful to Let Meas

Speaker Clark Declares that
the House Will be
Democratic.
Washington, Dec. 4.—The opening
of congress, promptly at noon today,
was marked by the usual flood of bills
and resolutions, many of which are
expected to die In committee or with
congress Itself on March 4.
While this was but the second ses
sion of the Sixty-fourth congress, the
preliminaries were more interesting
than usually Is the case in a final ses
sion. Conferences were held through
out Sunday ancTlhls morning and ev
erywhere there were evidences of
"lining up" for the sixty-fifth session.
A number of the solons will not re
turn In March, and, contrary to usual
custom, several prominent members
were Innocent on-lookers of the pre
sesslon doings.
Talk naturally drifted to the com
plexion of the next house, the senate
being assured the democrats.
Speaker Champ Clarke declared
that the next house, on the .basis of
the last election, would show at least
216 Democrats without Schuly of New
Jersey or Beakers of Michigan. He
conceded 21S to the Republicans.
These figures Include the Independent
group of four, which, with two In

Premier Trepoff Precludes
Hope of Settlement in the
East, Says Press.
Paris, Dec. 4.—The statement of
Premier Trepoff before the Duma
Sunday, is regarded here as the most
outspoken and powerful utterance
pronounced in Petrograd since the
outbreak of the war, and a complete,
crushing answer to German peace
intrigues.
"In his last speech," says Matin,
"Chanaellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
was careful not to say anything
against Russia. In a semi-official
statement he flattered her transpar
ently and hinted that, contrary to all
appearances, there might be an hon
orable understanding in the east.
Premier Trepoff's speech effectually
disposes of the chancellor's illusions."
The proclamation, among other
things, announced officially an agree
ment concluded by Russia, France
and Great Britain in 1915, and later
approved by Italy, establishes in a
definite manner the right of Russia
to the straits and Constantinople."
"For over 1,000 years Russia has
been reaching southward toward a
free outlet on the open sea. This age
long dream, cherished in the hearts
of the Russian people, is now ready
for realization."
"Russians should know for what
they are shedding blood,", he added.

the live stock show to the Inter

The Great Northern railway has
left nothing undone for the comfort
and convenience of the excursionists.

EXPLANATION
OF CRISIS IS

Indicated that Details of
Re-organization Are
Not Complete.
PREMIER MAKES
BRIEF STATEMENT
Makes no Denial of State
ment That Some Minis
ters Have Quit.
London, Dec. 4.—The expectation
that an explanation of the cabinet
crisis and its solution would be forth
coming when the House of Commons
met today was not realized.
Premier Asquith simply announced
that King George had approved his
proposal for the re-construction of the
government, which was forced by the
demand of War Secretary Lloyd
George and other ministers for a
smaller war council with powers in
dependent of the cabinet. The pre
mier suggested that the house adjourn
after today's business, which was non
controversial, until Thursday.
The statement by Sir James Henry
Dalsell, liberal member of Klrcaldy
Burghs, that the resignations of all
ministers had been handed to the pre
mier was not denied.
This was taken as an indication that
details of the reconstruction had not .'
yet been agreed upon and further ne
gotiations are necessary.
Lloyd George was not present dur
lng the sitting, but all other proml*,:
nerit figures in the'crisis appeared and
twere
cheered by their adherents as
they entered the chamber.
A. Bonar Law, secretary for the
colonies, occupied his usual seat next
to the premier and two were chatting
cheerfully as Asquith awaited an op
portunity to make his announcement.
This came when a question was asked
in regard to the appointment of food
supervision-
Asquith said that no one had been
appointed and then made the sugges
tion that such questions be postponed
until the reconstruction was consum
mated. Sir Edward Carson took his
seat amonp his followers and asked
questions, but took no part in the
questions arising from the premier's
statement in regard to the result of
his visit to the king.
Premier Asquith issued the follow
ing statement:
"The prime minister, with a view to
the most effective prosecution of the
war, has decided to advise his
majesty the kinp to consent to the re
construction of the government."
Nothing is known at the moment on
which to base .1 precise interpreta
tion of the official statement respect
ing "the reconstruction of the govern
ment." obviously a somewhat wide
term in the circumstances, and wheth
er it means a mere re-shuffling of
posts or something more drastic is not
yet apparent.
There is nothing suggesting that Mr.
Asquith contemplates abandoning the
premiership, or. indeed that any resig
nations are impending, and for the
moment the only important difference
In the personnel of the ministry seems
to be the readmission of Sir Edward
Caison.
David Lloyd George, who evidently
is the moving spirit in the whole
crisis, had not, it is now definitely
stated, offered his resignation to Pre
mier Asquith, but he has threatened
to resign in certain contingencies.
