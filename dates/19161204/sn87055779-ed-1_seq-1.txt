Ii'binatien.il New. Service:
WASH1NCT X, I'fc 4- The
"hih cost of government" h;us i-e-
eoioe a stern raility. for it will take
four and a half million dollar? a
day to ran the United States' ser
vice during the fiscal year, which
begins July. 1 next, according to the
annual estimates sent to conjrress
today hy See'y McAdoo, of tho treas
ury department. The estimates
called for an expenditure of H.
C54.S19.HÖ4 for the year, an in
crease of ?2 IT, 759. 762. over last
year's estimates and an increase of
$S 7, 19 7,4 5 8 over the appropriations
made by the last session of congress.
The estimates .showed clearly
that the United States is making
rapid progress; toward the point
where it will cost two billion dollars
a year, to meet the constantly in
creasing cost of government. Eleven
departmental classification? under
which the estimates were submitted
showed increases over last yea--and
only four items showed decreases.
Preparedness Costly.
Preparedness for war was the
greatest item in the hudlet for
next year. It demanded expend
itures of more than $S0O.O0O,0OO
under direction of the war and navy
departments, or about one-half of
the total estimated expenditure of
the government. The war depart
ment asked for more than $4 21,000,
000 for land defense and the navy
department demanding upwards of
$ .tS2.e-OO.000 to continue the jrreat
naval program outlined hy the last
session of congress. Iast vear the
war department spent J 3S 1 .000.000
and the navy department $:Ur..0o0.
00O, as the initial outlay for the new
prep arednes.-s plans.
The department of agriculture
a.-kfd for some 57,000,000 more
than it spent last year; the inter
ior department for some $4.000.00
more: the department of commerce
for nearly $ ".'Oe.OOO more: the de
partment of justice and department
of labor for about $1.000,000 more
each.
Slate Department Asks Ixs.
Despite the diplomatic burdens of
Ifu- European war the state depart
ment asked for only $,000.000 a a
against .:,ooo.('"'0 appropriated
during the last session of congress.
A sliL-ht decrease in the estimates
for pensions which called for $1 .".".
000. cor, as auainst $ 1 7. ,00,0,000 ap
propriated last year. wa.s shown
despite the recent increases in the
p-Mi-ann rate and is due to the crad
ual living off of the old soldiers.
Of the total of more than a bil
lion r-d a half dollars, the estimates
calculate that $325.000,ooo to he ex
pended by th1 postofheo depart
ment will oe protected by the postal
revenues. Upward of $80.000 000
cf the total will po into the sinking
fund to care for the bonded debt of
the country.
To Continue K. I. Valuation.
Arnonc the larger miscellaneous
items in the estimates, the inter
state commerce commission asks for
$2.. "00,000 fpr rontinuin.tr the phys
ical valuation of the railroads of
the country.
A sharp cut in proposals for river
and bart er improvement by the fed
eral irov rnment was indicated by
estimates for river and harl or ap
