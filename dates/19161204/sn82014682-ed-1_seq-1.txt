Word comes from Maui to 'the ef
fect that two county employes of long
standing, T. B. Lyons and Manuel C.
Ross, have been recently discharged
; and that the: discharge is said to be
due to their activities in the recent
political campaign. -
Lyons and Ross are both Demo
crats and boosted Dr. J. H. Raymond
for the senate in his hard-fought cam
paign. , In fact. It is said that Lyons
withdrew from the race to turn his
votes over to the medico.
Recently, 60 the Btory goes, after a
" meeting' of the Maui' board of super
visors the two men were notified that
their services as officials iii the
county clerk's office would be no
longer required. Hence the belief that
they were discharged for their politi
cal activities. Republicans on the
Maui board are said to outnumber the
Democrats.
Lyons has been in the service for
about eight years, Ross about three.

protest was at once voiced by many
people who declared that the proposi

school children would suffer if the
scheme went through.

been abandoned, although the railroad
owned the 6trip of land 60 feet wide
and which is at present inclosed by
the school fence. Mr. Filler said that
he had discussed the matter with the
yardmaster and asked why the switch
should be made to run through the
land in question. The yardmaster had
replied that a better curve could be
obtained by doing so, but that another
line could be taken without much
trouble. Superintendent Filler there
j upon Instructed, the yardmaster to
alter the lines, so that by moving the
track about 20 Teet the school lot 13

TO NEXT LEGISLATURE
Thinks Any Increase Should
Be on Graduated Per- ;

Hawaii's public school teachers arc
entitled to and should have an ; in
crease of salary. - v'
This ts the opinion of Henry WV Kin
ney, superintendent of public Instruc
tion, as expressed at a meeting us
ation and in sutements to tne. siai
Bulletin todays The statements by
Superintendent Kinney are : in- line
with recommendations made by::'- the
I'onl iatrhero nnrl sit the annual mwt-
... " " . .
ing of the Territorial Teachers Associ-J,
auun, neia in uonoiiuu, mai iuc cu
goguer be given more money. -
Superintendent Kinney attended the
meeting; of the Maui teachers where '
the qnestion of a salary taise was '
taken Qp after it was 'learned that a J
similar question was to be discussed In'
Honolulu. Asked by. the meeting forj
his opinion, Kinney, Bald he felt the.
teachers have every right .to expect a I
raise in salary as,' in these days of.
prosperity, everyone is receiving high-.
er compensation, and partly since tne
cost of living is making It. almost im
rossible for the teacher pn a small
salary to get along; " ' ' j- ' j
Must Maintain' Standard - .
; In expressing this opinion Superin
tendent Kinney was referring to all
the public school teachers ; in the ter
ritory; - ; '.'-'.i-'-'X- )"
"It should'be remembered". he told
thSUr-Bolltel'tr,4 teach
er is required to-. maintain a standard
of living hich wjll be 'a credit both
to the teacher anif to the community.
A teacher must have decent clothing
and live in decent surroundings and
have decent associates, and all this
costs' money. -j
VThe teachers in the Hawaiian Isl
ands re better paid than teachers in
most of the states, but;thd cost of liv
bngis considerably, higberl here. Since
the paying of bonuses, the lower paid
public school teachers do not get as
much pay as that of many plantation
laborers.;:: '-v
Percentage Plan Best
"I recommend very strongly to the
teachers, however, that in any -effort
to secure better pay they ask that
the increase In. the salary, appropria
tion be made on the percentage basis.
There are two reasons for this:
"First, because in this way the pro
portions established by the present
salary schedule would be maintained,
although the salaries would be higher
throughout; '
"Second, that in case some time in
the future a retrenchment policy is
inaugurated, a3 was done during the
tj.me George R. Carter was governor
and when all salaries of teachers were
reduced 20 per cent, it will be most
unlikely that any reduction would be
made beyond the percentage of In
crease made by the coming legislature,
should it be made."
Superintendent Kinney adds that he
declined to recommend at the Maui
meeting any particular rate of In
crease, saying he thought this was
a matter to be taken up directly with
the next legislature.
"But I think," he said today, "that
the rate of increase should be higher
for teachers being paid belOw $100 a
month than for those being paid above
that amount, although I think all
classes should have the -increase'
The new officers of the Territorial
Teachers' Association have under con
sideration a resolution presented ad
the annual meeting last naay urging
that all public school teachers be giv
en a raise in salary. ?. -" ;r:;

e the City Planning Commission.
Called into session by the request
of the Hawaiian Electric Company
that two .miles of handsome Iron wood

the commission heard for an hour this

sentiment not only against the Waipio
cutting, but against sacrificing trees
and shrubs for the saice of light, tele
phone and power wires.
The session speedily developed from
a bearing on the particular proposal
of the electric company to a strong
protest from citizens against ruthless
mutilation of trees by public service
corpcratlons. i-orria A. Tburstcn lei
the protest with a forceful and at

EI, SAYS CABLE
That the ; majority 'of the freight
for Honolulu piled upon the wharves
and in cars at San Francisco will be
cleared up by the next arrival of the
Lurline and Wilhelmina is the . glad
tidings - received today by Raymond
C. Brown, j; secretary of the Chamber
of Commerce, who has been investi
gating the situation for the past few
weeks. - . , ' :,.
- Brown has sent several cables to the
mainland .after Information on this
subject, and the one received today
winds up his investigation. The cable
said that when the Lurline and Wil
helmina left San' Francisco on De
cember 6 and 13 respectively, all brok
en consignments of freight would be
cleared up which is taken to mean
by local merchants that all the Christ
mas supplies will arrive on time. From
other cables it is evident also that
congestion in all freight is nearjng
Its end, and by the first of the year
the Matson and other steamship lines
should be handling all consignments
without delays. .
The cable today says , that the two
steamers will take care of all freight
in less than carload lots ("broken
consignments") for Honolulu and It Is
believed that no Christmas goods are
commg in unbroken carload lots.
