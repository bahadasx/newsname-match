INCREASED SALARIES ASKED
Liberal Awards fqr.Schools and
Parks Urged $25,000 to
Fight Paralysis.
Estimates calling for a Dlitriot np
proprlatlon bill of l,961,o2.66 for
the fiscal year 1018, wore ont to Con
crcaa 'today.
In amount the estimates are. record
breaking, but do not contain so ninny
legislative rGCommendatlonH na the
Commlasloner aubmltted. a year ago.
For the current fiscal year Con
Kress allo-ed the District aynroxi
mately ll2.8S0.od0. The estimated,
therefore, are about $4,000,000 In ex
eeii of tho current budget, and are
likely to be considerably, pruned by
the Appropriations Committee.
Bstlmatos submitted for, the District
last year were about J1M73.000.
Much Aekert for Parka.
Two of the largest Items In the
atlmatoa submitted today relato to
parks. The Commissioners again at
tempt to persuade Congress to pur
chase the Dean and ratterson tracts,
at an aggregate cost of more than
11,000,000, for park purposes.
It wm urged a year ago that those
fine properties were about to fall Into
private hands and tho Government
should buy them and extend the city s
park aystem which la rapidly be'
coming Inadequate for a growing pop
ulation. Congress, howovor, failed to
appropriate, and the Commissioners
earnestly ronew their recommenda
tion. , .
An appendix to the estimates states
the Commissioners havo not asked for
an appropriation bill larger than Dis
trict revenues will justify. Thoy fig
ure that the revenues of the District
will be quite ample to meet tho Dis
trict's half of a II 8.000.000 budget.
Would Forestall Paralysis.
For tho first time the District esti
mates curry an Item which seeks
money to forestall any epidemic of In
fantile paralysis In the National, Capi
tal. It U recommended that the sum
of $36,000 tie allowed as a prevention
fund and to combat the dlseaso should
It make Us appearance here next year.
This precautionary estimate la sub
mltted because of tho Infantile paral
ysla scourge In New York during-the
Fast summer and the presence 'or a
ew cases In tho District of Columbia.
Exclusive of the , water service,
which Is self-sustaining, the District
estimates amount to $1C.S7.0:..
Tho Commissioners seek a legisla
tive rider providing that hereafter
"all estimates of appropriations In any
way affecting the revenues of the
District shall bo submlttod to the
Commissioners of said District of Co
lumbia on or before October 1 of each
year, and all such estimates shall be
Included In the regular annual est!
mates of appropriations for said Dis
trict." Would Centralise Odds and I'.uds.
This would centralise the odds and
ends of appropriations relating to the
District which nre carried In other
bills and glvo tho Commissioners Ju
risdiction over all expenditures relat
ing to local affairs.
A complote analysis of the esti
mates sent to Congress today by the
Commissioners Is printed below. The
high points In tho annual estimates
may be summarised ns follows:
llecommendatlon Is made that the
salaries of Commissioners Newman
and llrownlow bo Increased to I7.B00
per year, and the salary of the Engl
near Commissioner. Major Kutx, be

This "small, rompsct body" for

The estimated appropriations exceed
by approximately 187.000.000 the ap

year.
No satisfactory comparison can be
made with the estimates originally
submlttod last year because these es
