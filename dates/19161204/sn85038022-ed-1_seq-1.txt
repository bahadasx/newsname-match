RESOLUTIONS
Adopted hj the Members of the? On.
tral 1'reshytrrlan I linrrh I'pon the
Helg-nation of I heir Pastor.
Ret. II. Kerr Taylor.
Never, perhaps, in the history of our
little city, has the relationship between
paator and people been more sorrow
fully and reluctantly severed, than yes
U rday morning; at the Central Presby
terian Church when the young pastor,
Rev. H, Kerr Taylor, requested that
the congregation unite with him 'n
asking Presbytery for his release to go
to China.
Although his stay here has been
brief, he will never be forgotten by the
people to whom he has ministered. In
their memory, ho will live as one who
has kept close to the Master; gaining
from Mm much of His power and at
traction; in their hearts, as one who
has learned His love and imparted it,
winning all who Imvc come to know
him, In return.
At the congregational meeting ap
preciative resolutions were adopted.
Other transactions at this time were
the election of Mr. J. Condit Stevenson
as an elder and Mr. James II. Ross as
n deacon.
Mr. Taylor will remain with the Cen
tral Church until after the seventeenth
Ol this month.

NIKE BROWN
"The Square Deal Man"
Are t icrted hj the Heads of the Ln
ml Warehouse at the Opening of
the Opening of the UHM7
Season tomorrow Morn
ing at O'rlork.
The opening of the tobacco season
of the Maysvllle Market for the season
of 1916-17 will be held tomorrow morn
ing beginning at tl o'clock. Plans are
being made for a very successful sea
son In this city and to bring this city
more to the fore aa a loose leaf mar
ket The warehousemen will hold a meet
ing in this city tonight to appoint a su
pervisor of sales and to make some
plans regarding the opening of the sea
son. It is understood that there are
three candidates for the position of
supervisor. Tha three gentlemen are
expert judges of tobacco and the ware
housemen will have a rather difficult
time in selecting one out of the three
for the position.
The warehousemen will also decide
tonight the house In which to open the
sales. There will be hardly any choice
In this matter as each of the warehouse
has about an equal amount of tobacco
on hands. The sales will start prompt
ly at 9 o'clock regardless of which
house they will open In. The sales
will continue in a regular order from
the house in which they start and it is
probable that all houses will get a sale
for the opening day.
It is thought by some of the leading
tobacco men that about 200,000 pounds
of the weed will be on the floors of the
various houses to be disposed of to
morrow. A great number of wagons
are rolling in this morning as the
growers are anxious to take advantage
of the opening prices. The averago
on the Lexington market at the open
ing day was $16.38 per hundred and the
local market is expected to do as well
While the fall has been rather dry
in this section of the country yet in
the past two weeks there has been
enough rain to get the tobacco in con
dition for stripping. The growers im
mediately took advantage of this damp
spell in order to get their tobacco on
the market before the holidays so as
to obtain some Christmas money. Very
few whole crops will be brought In be
fore the holiday season it is thought.
It is expected that there will be no
delay in the unloading of tobacco on
the market this year as has been ex
perienced in previous years. This con
dition last year was greatly Improved
and it is thought that there Is ample
facilities this year so as to cause no
delay.
A number of years ago, before the
Maysvillc market had reached its pres
ent state of development, farmers ex
perienced a great deal of delay in sell
ing, and the tobacco often remained
on the streets for several days with
no sort of shelter. This condition has
been done away with now. There are
eight houses In this city and tho drive
ways of these houses provide ample
shelter for any tobacco that cannot be
immediately unloaded, and the floor
space is so large that very little delay
is experienced In unloading. Last year
there were but few times that the to
bacco could not have been uumaded
and sold within three days after reach
ing the market.
With the opening of the tobacco sea
son each year a large number of per
sons gain employment that would oth
wlse be denied them. It is extimated
at 1000 people annually And employ
ment during the tobacco season rn the
warehouses and In the redrying plants.
Including buyers, floor managers, auc
tioneers and laborers. A large number
of women are included In this, they be
ing employed In the redrying plants
sticking tobacco.
The following are the sales man
agers at the various houses:
Farmers and Planters, Mr. A. L.
Powers.
Growers, Mr. J. C. Rains.
Independent-Central, Mr. L. C. Park
er. Amason, Mr. T. V. Goodman.
Home, Mr. A. T. Day.
Liberty, Mr. C. M. Jonea.

Mr. Colby, the cartoonist, wuo will
appear iu the Maysvllle High School
auditorium tonight in appearance is
almost the living image of the immor
tal Dill Nye. As he talks to hia au
dience he transfers a variety of con
t'Ptions from his imaginative brain to
.li ' concrete form of crayon pictures.
Seme of his pictures are amusing;
some, such as his landscape scenes,
are as beautiful as paintings. Many
ourridors and classrooms in public
M hoel buildings in Chicago are orna
ii'ented with large crayon pictures that
aiv st iivenirs of Qaofga E. Colby's
Mptllar entertainment "New Ideas In
Crayon."
The Chicago Tribune in speaking of I
Colby says that he Is remarkable for!
combining in hia treatment strength,
sentiment, delicacy and a nam less
charm The Chicago News says, "Mr.,
Colby's talks are full of surprises, and
one marvels at the sudden appearance
of pictures both beautiful and comic as
tliey come out of a mass of color and
lines."
The niosi elToetivo transformation
tliat is attempt led by Mr. Colby is that
embodying the arousing of Mount
Vesuvius from slumber to rage. He
draws In colors of crayon Illustrations
of the famous mountain as viewed
at l-OM the beautiful hay of Naples,
the artist darkens the sky with a
sudden brush of black mnoko from the
crater. This addition to the scene !s
miiekly followed by the Issuance of
a stream of fire and lava, which pours
tor the bowl of the crater and down
tin mountain side. The picture Is rap
idlv altered to display volcanic Are
lighting up a cloudy sky and being re
0t ' ted In the waters of the bay.
