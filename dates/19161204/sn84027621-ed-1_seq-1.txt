GHDUND
ATHENS BRITISH
The Rumanian situation appeared
but little better, for the Rumanians
today, despite the reported Russo
Rumanian successes in holding back
the invaders southwest of Bucharest.
Bucharest appeared seriously threat
ened from the southwest, northwest,
south and southeast. The . force of
the converging attack pressing from
three sides upon Bucharest appeared
undiminished. The resisting power of
the Rumanians, however, aided by. the
Russians seemed strengthened. Upon
their success apparently depends the
safety of both Bucharest and the
main Rumanian armies within the
angle of the Teutonic thrust.
The Serbians in Macedonia have
driven the Bulgarians back from the
vicinity of Gruishte toward Stravina
four miles northeast, . said Paris.
The British cabinet problem appear
ed near solution. The belief prevailed
that the coalition government has
been saved by a decision to recon
struct it. An agreement on the war
council is expected soon.

hill north of Grunishte on the Mace

United States of America will
be Impregnable
(Associated Press)
Washington, Dec. 4 Estimates for
maintaining and strengthening the
aimy and navy during the fiscal year
1918 indicate that Congress will be
asked this winter to provide about
$800,000,000 for that purpose.
The total of estimates already sub
mitted and made public today when
Congress convened, is $757,584,560 to
cover the military activities of both
departments. Statements made by
navy officials to the House naval com
mittee, now considering that bill, have
foreshadowed however, large supple
mentary estimates to be submitted
later, and a similar situation exists at
the war department.
The preliminary estimate for the
army is $373,074,565, an increase of
about $70,000,000 over the amount ap
propriated for 1917. Thenavy total
of $379,151,701 is an increase of $66,
451,146 over 1917 figures. Panama
canal fortifications will take $5,358,
300, an increase of about $300,000.
More than $10,000,000 of the army
increase will go into the. payment of
regulars, national guardsmen and
members of the reserve. A total of
$97,794,995 is sought under the pay
item and the estimates show that the
number of privates provided for under
this section is 258,594. Of that total
94,279 would be in the regular service
and 164,315 in the national guard.
Provision also is made for the pay
ment of 25,000 members of the regu
lar enlisted reserve and for full rate
payment of these men for 15 days
field trainincr durine the year. . The
provision for payment of reserve offi
cers is $3,151,983 and that for paying
nati0nal guard officers $3,396,940.
A NEW MUSICAL ORGANIZATION
One of the pleasing features of. the
Elks' memorial exercises Sunday was
the excellent playing of the orchestra
which the Star cannot but make a fav
orable comment.
This is a new organization of the
Baptist Sunday school, known as the
Baptist Sunday School Orchestra,
which was organized, taught and con
ducted by Dr. F. E. McClane, in which
he should feel justly proud, as the
majority of these young folks have
taken Up these various instruments
and made this advancement in the last
six months. If this organization wil
put forth the effort in the next year
that it has in the past six months, we
predict an organization that our whole
city will take pride in.
Those composing the Baptist Sun
day School Orchestra are: Dr. F. E
McClane, conductor: Laurie Izlar, E.
C. Smith Jr., William Nehrboss, M. A.

Dixie Highway and Orange Avenue
Make Another Excellent
Drive
One of the best things done by the
county commissioners recently is the
building of the road connecting Or
ange avenue with Santos and the
Dixie Highway. The drive out Orange
avenue and back to the city by way of
the Dixie Highway, or vice versa, is
one of the most attractive in the
county, and will doubtless become
very popular. This new cross road is
in Commissioner Sam Pyles' district,
and it connects with Orange avenue
just beyond Capt. Pyles' farm, at the
corner of the W. M. Gist farm.
A BUSY DAY SATURDAY
In addition to the three used Max
well cars sold and reported in Satur
day afternoon's paper, the Maxwell
agency, after 12 o'clock Saturday, cold
another used Maxwell, a 1916 model,
to Mr. A. Proctor and his son of
Pedro, father and brother of Mr. J. D.
Proctor, who pirchased one in the
morning. A new or 1917 model Max
well was then sold to Mr. A. W. War
ren of Center Hill, a naval stores
operator. Mr. L. W. Yonge drove Mr.
Warren home in his new car and
caught the midnight train home. This
was one of the busy days in the Max
well agency that comes every now
and then, the force selling and deliv
ering during the day five cars, new
and used.

on account of the absence of witnesses
asked that the cases be continued un

PRICES
(Associated Press)
Washington, Dec. 4. Congress met
at noo ntoday for the short session
and settled down to work immediate
ly. The usual flood of bills and reso
lutions were offered. Party leaders
centered their energy on the supply
bills and the general program, fore
most on which was the president's
railroad legislation program.
Representative Fitzgerald of New
York, introduced four bills designed to
tcuch the high cost of living, two pro
posing a food embargo, one regulat
ing the transportation of cold storage
foods and the fourth regulating the
admission of farm products and man
ufactured foodstuffs to the parcels
pest and reducing food prices.
SUNDAY SERVICES
The Presbyterian congregation
heard a most excellent sermon Sun
day morning from the text: "Is not
this great Babylon which I have build
ed?" Rev. J. R. Herndon laid stress
on the fact that the king who asked
this question had left God out of con
sideration in the building of the city.
He made many blunders but did not
recognize them. The construction of
the city had been for his own glory
and he gave to himself the honor for
what had been accomplished. He
Ipried'ln his strength. Ultimately
he. failed completely. He was weak
without Realizing 'it. The speaker
then called attention to the necessity
of building with God as a co-worker.
Except' the watchman keep the city
the builders work in vain." "The pow
ers that be are ordained of God."
These and other scripture passages
were quoted in proof of. the neces
sity of taking God into account in
building a city. Right officials ought
to be elected by the 'people; off en-
sive obstructions removed. The church j
and the Christian sabbath are en
couragements to right building. In
closing, the attention of the congre
gation , was called to the folly of an
individual or a- city undertaking to
build without God. Illustrations were
given from the Bible and from every
day life to show this folly. Left alone
man will blunder and fail. Working
with God he will accomplish victory
after victory. At the night service
the closing" program of the week of
piayer for Home Missions was rend
ered. Extra music was enjoyed. A
special song by the Junior Socitey and
the solo of Miss Blake were special
features. The program was quite in
teresting and helpful.
The Rev. Bunyan Stephens at the
Baptist church spoke on "Florida:
The Melting Pot of the World's Re
ligions." He gave a brief statement
of the process of melting various ores
into usable form and some explana
tions as to the construction of the fur
nace.
He used the three common terms of
the foundry; ore, furnace and pig, as
points in his discourse. In calling at
tention to the various elements enter
ing into the ore of Florida's relig
ious furnace he mentioned the large
number of foreigners, composing one
eighth of the population, the Indians,
the various sects and isms, numbering
at. least forty-eight, the undeveloped
and houseless churches of Florida. As
to the furnace, that is, Florida the
receiver of these various elements, it
was pointed out that the following
activities on the part of the churches
of Florida make it possible to meet the
needs and, appropriate foreigners and
others so as to make them good citi
zens. City missions, persistent and
aggressive proclamation of Bible
truths, efficient enlistment of the un
developed churches. The results 'of
such work will enable Florida to pro
duce saved men and women who will
be an asset for all the interests of the
state. Also produce a type of man
hood interested in sending the gospel
unto the end3 of -the earth.

OF
AMOUNT
NEFDED BY THE
GOVEilllT
It Will Take Over a Billion and a
Quarter Next Year for
Running Expenses
(Associated Press) .
Washington, Dec. 4. Estimates of
the expense of all branches of the
government for the fiscal year 1918,
for which the session of Congress as
sembling today must appropriate
funds, total $1,268,715,834.
This sum is exclusive of $325,355,
820 to be appropriated for the postal
service which is expected to be return
ed to the treasury by postal revenue
and a sinking fund appropriation of
$60,748,000 toward the public debt.
The total appropriations for the
fiscal year 1917 ending next June, ex
clusive of these two items, were $1,
184,157,517. The increase of some $84,000,000
represents the geenral trend of the
constantly increased cost of govern
ment as well as the increased cost of
living. Increases in compensation and
in numbers of employees are to be
found in the estimates of all branches
of the government, and to meet that
tendency administration officials have
attempted a policy of paring down all
proposals for new projects with the
exception of national defense, expen
ditures to meet the growth of -the
country and the many burdens thrust
upon the United States by the war.
The estimates laid before Congress,
today by the treasury department
follow:
Legislative ....$ 13,524,479
Executive 688,370
State department 6,315,847
Treasury department '. . 165,681,233
Independent offices 8,130,724
District of Columbia... 17,885,026
War department 421,352,447

Dept. of Labor 4,690,677
Dept. of Justice 11,555,696
Total $1,268,715,834
(Cents omitted).
The greatest increases are of course
in the estimates for carrying out the
national policy of defense. Where the
war department appropriations for
the current year were $381,482,802 it
estimates this year for $421,352,447.
The navy appropriation which was
$315,613,781 for the current year,
would according to the estimate be
$382,497,536.
