Annual Meeting.
(Special to the Pioneer)
Muskogee, Okla., Dec. 4.D. N.
Flint of Muskogee was elected presi
dent of the International Jefferson
Highway association to succeed E.
T. Meredith of Des Moines by the
unanimous vote of the board of di
rectors at the annual meeting held
here last week.
St. Paul, Minn was selected as the
place of meeting next June.
W. A Hopkins of Des Moines, la.,
was elected vice president of the as
sociation, Walter Parker of New Or
leans, secretary and F. J. Wright of
Des Moines, la., treasurer.
The constitution and by-iaws were
revived, with a provision that all
ex-presidents' are to be ex-officio
members of the board of directors.
Fur-beclad good roads boosters
from the pines of Minnesota mingled
with enthusiasts from the palms* of
Louisiana, while broad-sombreroed
gentlemen from the plains of Texas
cussed bad roads' and discussed good
ones with better road advocates from
Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma
at the annual directors meeting
which was held Wednesday. The at
tendance surpassed the wildest ex
pectations of the members of the as
sociation. Every state through
which the Jefferson highway will
pass was represented.
The state of Louisiana sprung a
surprise on the board by sending
Mrs John E Kimball of Shreveport
as its only representative. She is
the only woman member of the board
of directors.
The Minnesota directors! who at
tended were Daniel Shaw of Thief
River Falls and Senator Thomas E.
Cashman of Owatonna.
D.. Clarkson, general manager of
the Jefferson Highway association,
who has made overland trips from
one end of the Jefferson highway to
the other, from Winnipeg, Canada,
to New Orleans, La made an infor
mal report in which he said that
all along the route the counties and
states are taking a remarkable in
terest in the construction of the
great highway and that most of the
county associations have paid .their
mileage assessments in full.
He laid great stress upon the neces
sity of marking off the Jefferson
highway, stating that as soon as this*
was done the association will have
some tangible assets This work will
cost in the neighborhood of $3,000,
he thought He pointed out that
there is a balance on hand of $1,200
in the treasury and that checks sent
in from various counties* of the states
along the line will amount to over
$9,000 Mr. Clarkson told the direct
ors that he was drawing $250 per
month salary and that his publicity
agent is receiving $20 a week and
his stenographer at Des Moines $12
per week.
The county of Muskogee, it was
pointed out, will be the first to vote
road bonds to be used in the con
struction of the Jefferson highway.
"The chief aim of the Jefferson
highway in establishing hard sur
faced good roads through the country
is not tnat owners of automobiles in
other states may travel easily over
the country on their sight-seeing
tours, but that the states may be
united and given opportunity to de
velop places that otherwise would
not be^-developed," said S. Wolsiten
croft, publicity manager, in an ad
dress. "The railroads do not offer
all the advantages of well regulated
and cared for trails," he added.

"When it comes1

BEMIDJI. MINNESOTA, MONDAY EVENING. DECEMBER 4, 1916.
to the healing of
the wounds and the relief of the dis
tressed, all the world is one great
brotherhood."
This statement was made Sunday
afternoon at the lodge of sorrow of
the Bemidji B. P. O. E., No. 1052,
by Adolph O. Eberhart, former gov
ernor of Minnesota. Mr. Eberhart
delivered the main address of the
program.
In speaking of the world as a
brotherhood, he said: "To assume
the leadership in that great brother
hood movement ia now not only the
sacred duty but the unquestioned
privilege of our country. We possess
the required natural resources, the
fratecnal spirit infused into our cos
mopolitan citizenship and institu
tions by the greatest fraternal or
ders in the world, and we have the
energy, ability and experience re
quisite to extend this Service to the
remotest corners of the earth. Such
leadership will ultimately make Am
erica the most powerful factor in the
establishment of world peace. Few
seem to realize the tremendous op
portunities that this greatest of all
wars for conquest and extermination
has thrust upon us. It has1
not only
placed at our disposal an unlimited
expansion of commercial and indus
trial enterprise, but has made it pos
sible for the United States of Am
erica to becom,e the greatest factor
in shaping the diplomatic relations
of every country in the entire civil
ized world." i
The Grand theater was crowded at
the Elks' services*. An excellent pro
gram was given. Burchard's orches
tra rendered several selections. Miss
Elizabeth Erickson and Miss Ida Vir
ginia Brown sang solos and Miss
Vera Backus1
gave a reading, Rev
B. D. Hanscom delivered the bene
diction.
Fifteen members of the Bemidji
lodge have died. They are George A.
Markham, A. Wyler, Fred D. Stil
lings, Patrich Walsh, Edson Eggle
ston, James Lappen, Henry McCabe,
George A. Hanson, Vinton Ellis,
Thomas Symons, Fred Eberlein,
Chester Gracie, Richard Walsh, Wil
lis L. Wyman and Ernest J. Holler.
In speaking of the memorial ser
vices of the Elks, Mr. Eberhart said:
"Our annual memorial service would
be unwxrth of^its name did it not
bring to our minds an earnest con
templating of our relation to the
Great Exalted Ruler of the Universe
and the life hereafter.
"Our order is founded upon the
great principles of charity, justice,
brotherly love and fidelity, and no
Elk is worthy of the name who does
not willingly sacrifice something for
the welfare of his brother.
"This afternoon has been set aside
for the special purpose of paying
tribute to our departed brothers that
we might show to the world how
their faults have been written upon
the sand and their virtues upon tab
lets of memory in our hearts."
Mr. Eberhart explained the good
work of Elks and of the work that
should be done by a good Elk. His
address was very well received.
He was the guest of honor at a
dinner party at the Markham hotel
Sunday evening.
Judge C. W. Stanton of the dis
trict court delivered the memorial
address at the lodge of sorrow at Vir
ginia, Minn., Sunday.
Judge Stanton in his address
pointed out that selfishness more
than any other trait of human char
acter, is the source of the greater
portion of misery and discontent.
"Selfishness destroys all happiness
in those who yield to its control
takes away even the capacity for
happiness and causes us to disregard
the happiness of those with whom
we associate," he said. "The world's
history presents a panorama of wars,
strife, bloodshed and misery, all the
work of this selfish nature. The ap
palling war of exhaustion and exter
mination now being waged in Europe,
in which the rank and file wonder
why they are fighting and what is
hoped to be gained by the awful sac
rifice of lives and property, furnishes
the greatest demonstration in all his
tory of the far-reaching direful con
sequences of national selfishness and
personal ambition."

CONGRESS ASKED
TO APPROPRIATE
$25,000 FOR NEW
POSTOFFICE HERE
Treasury Department at Opening Ses
sion of 64th Congress Asks for
Appropriation.
WILL TAKE $1,654,819,654 TO
RUN GOVERNMEN NEXT YEAR
President Wilson Expected to Give
Message to Congress Tomorrow
Food Embargo Up.
(By United Press)
Washington, Dec. 4.The treas
ury department at the convening at
noon today of the 64th congress for
its dying session, asked for an ap
propriation of $25,000 for the con
tinuation of the new federal build
ing at Bemidji, Minn., and $13,000
for the completion of the Little
Falls, Minn., postoffice.
The treasury department asked
congress for $10,497,404 for the fiscal
year ending June, 1918, for the com
pletion of public buildings. The last
budget was slightly over seven mil
lion .dollars.
Seventeen members of the senate
and 70 odd "lame duck" members of
the house today began their final leg
islative duties. When the spotlight
fades March 4 on this congress, they
will gather up their togas and start
for home and private citizenship.
These "lame ducks" are those the
populace turned thumbs down upon
in the last election. Their services
range anywhere from a little less
than a year, in the case of Senator
Tom Taggart of Indiana, to 22 years
in the cases of Senator Clarence D.
Clark of Wyoming and Representa
tive Sparkman of Florida, Clark run
ning third in the point of service
in the senate, and Sparkman fourth
in continuous service in the house.
The political history of the ses
sion depends on how the members
having the balance of powera Pro
hibitionist, a Socialist, a couple of
Independents and several members,
who may vote any way at allshape
is their party preference.'
When the call is sounded for the
election of a speaker, the country
will find out whether the house is
really Democratic or Republican.
President Wilson will address con
gress tomorrow.
Representative Fitzgerald and his
threatened food embargo legislation
was the center of interest when the
session began. Fitzgerald's declara
tion late in November that he would*
introduce a resolution for a food em
bargo to keep products in the United
States and reduce the cost of living
stirred up a political hornets' nest.
Senator Borah of Idaho announced
before the opening of the session
that he would introduce a bill ask
ing for the repeal of the army reor
ganization bill because of the sec
tions referring to state militias.
Packed galleries greeted the gavels
of Speaker Clark and Vice President
Marshall as chattering members of
the two houses.*, in most cases meeting
for the first time since the eventful
day in September when they rushed
through the Adamson eight-hour bill
law, turned to hear the familiar ad
monition to "be in order."
Senator Gallinger and Senator
Kern, Republican, and Democratic
floor leaders, respectively, were
named senate members of the joint
committee to notify President Wil
son that congress was ready to hear
him. The house named as its mem
bers Majority Leader Kitchin, Min
ority Leader Mann and Representa
tive Fitzgerald, chairman of the ap
propriations committee.
Estimates of departments were
submitted to congress this afternoon.
It will take $1,654,819,654.03 to
run the government of the United
States from June 30, 1917, to June

CLERGYMEN AND
CITIZENS PRAISE
DRAMA OF VICE
Run it!
So say the clergymen of Bemidji
regarding the photo-drama, "Is Any
Girl Safe?"
This photo-drama of vice is to be
shown today and tomorrow at the
Grand theater, and in response to a
special invitation extended by Man
ager Glen S. Harding of the Grand
and F. A. Wilson, former Bemidji
editor, one of the owners of the film,
a special showing-of the picture was
made at 9:30 o'clock this, morning.
Those attending the special per
formance included Mayor Charles W.
Vandersluis, Chief of Police Frank
Ripple and clergymen of various de
nominations, newspaper men and a
few women. Following the perform
ance these expressions were made by
the different ministers:
Rev. P. Warford, First Pres
byterian church: "Although the
subject handled Is* admittedly deli
cate, it is handled with exceeding
care and cleverness and the film
maintains a strong moral tone
throughout. I was deeply impressed
with the film and it is my belief that
it will exert a strong influence for
good on any audience. I wish to em
phasize that the picture is clean and
modest and powerful."
Rev. Father John Philippe
of St. Philip's church said: "The
picture is one that should be seen.
The lesson is made plain and with
such dramatic* force that while the
interest is keen from the beginning,
it seems to me that all who watch
the action of the film must be con
tinually conscious of the terrible
penalty which must be paid for sin
and satisfaction which comes from
leading a clean life. I would say
without hesitation that much good
must result from showing a film con
taining such a realistic sermon as this
film does."
Rev. B. D. Hanscom, First Metho
dist church, said: "It appeals to me
that Mr. Wilson should be con
gratulated for putting on a picture
of this kind. I have seen other films)
purporting to deal with this subject
but they contained so much of the
coarse and vulgar that the result
was not for the best, while this film
preaches a sermonwith realism,
that is truebut without obnoxious
details. I can enthusiastically slay
that the picture impressed me deeply
and I believe that it will do the same
thing to others who see it."
Rev. I. D. Alvord, First Baptist
church: "Your picture is absolutely
true to life. It happens that in my
work I once came directly in contact
with the conditions as revealed in
'Is Any Girl Safe?' and I know that
what is shown in the films* exist and
girls are daily trapped, just as the
girls in the picture are trapped and
deceived into the horrors of a life
which you paint so vividly."
One of the ladies attending the
special showing remarked": 'It is too1
bad that you place the age limit at
16. I wish that my 13-year-old
daughter might see that picture."
Anticipating one of the largest
crowds in the history of that play
house, the management of the Grand
has* arranged with "Hak" to photo
graph the crowd in front of the thea
ter tonight during the showing of
"Is Any Girl Safe?" In order to take
the picture, "Hak" will use his pow
erful electric photographic light,
placing the camera in front of Bar
ker's and flooding the street and
crowd with a light said to be nearly
a sstrong as the sun's ray*.
