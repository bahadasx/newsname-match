ELECTORAL SYSTEM CONDEMNED
Representative Carter Will Urge An
Amendment for Direct Vote.
I Washington. Dee. 4 . Representative
'Carter of Oklahoma will Introduce !
'resolution in congress calling for the
submission of a constitutional amend
no lit providing for election of presi
dent by direct vote of the people and
abolishing the electoral college.
I "The electoral college system Is a
useless thing in elections," said Mr.
Carter. "It might have been the only
system when tho government was
I founded, but conditions have changed,
i mnl we are confronted with the prob
lem of changing the system to meet
the advance. Under tne direct vote
every section of the country would
Ihave a fuller representation. Take
I the south, the people do not go to the
'polls on the general election day un
less there is a local issue, since the
primary settles a contest. It is sur
prising the number of people who do
not know that they now vote for
electors In place of the candidate of
their party."
Mr. Carter also will Introduce a
"lill to oxtend the tiMie to: making
payments by purchasers of surface of j
the segregated mineral lands.

MANY IMPORTANT MEASURES
ARE TO BE ENACTED INTO
LAWS DURING THE SHORT SES
SION OF CONGRESS.
Washington, Dec. 1. Tho Sixty
Foitrlh Congress reconvened lit
noon today for its second session
will end with the life of tho present
Congress on March 1. Tho adminis
tration, although assured of control
for four more years in all branches,
excepting possibly the House of Rep
resentatives, lias an ambitious legis
lative program all of which cannot be
crowded Into the next three months.
Where the administration Is to
draw the line on general legislation
has not been determined. Party con
ferences will outline the program to
be attempted in addition to the ap
propriation bills whirh must lie
passed to meet expenditures of gov
ernment for the fiscal year 11M7 l'.HS.
When congress adjourned last Sep
tember, the Democratic Senate cau
cus agreed that the immigration bill,
with Its oft w toed literacy test, would
bo taken iii and passed before con
sideration of any oilier legislation.. It
also had agreed to act on the Owen
corrupt pr, unices bill, a measure
to limit expenditures in national poli
tical campaigns and to prot ide new
penalties for election frauds. Both
measures hail been pressed at the
end of the session, to the embarass
nient of both parties, and were aban
doned by mutual consent despite the
urgent demands of a few members.
Resides these two measures the
memorable railroad eight hour day
fight which marked the last days of
the last session had ended with legis
lation suggested by President Wilson
unconsidered. It will be urged upon
the Congress by the administration
above all other subjects. In fuct
the joint committee created by Con
gres to Investigate the whoLe subject
of railroad problems has been in
session two weeks preparing recom
mendations and it is apparent that
this will be the dominating feature
of the session. (
In iew of t!ie probability that the
idiiilnls'ration is to face a divided
Sixty-fifth Congress or at y-st a tion
dependable plurality In th- lower
fiou-c. it is the hope of Democratic
leadi rs to complete hefor the March
