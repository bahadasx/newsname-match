It is absolutely impossible to give you any idea of the
quality, flavor and richness of STONE'S "RICH FRUIT"
CAKE through the medium of paper and ink.
We could easily use a column in telling you about the
materials that go into it—Pineapples from Hawaii, Al
monds from Spain, Pecans from Texas, Cherries from
California, and so on through the list of twelve fruits that
are used —but what good does it do to name them over,
when the deliciousness is only half in the materials, the
other half being the art and skill with which they are
combined to make the perfect FRUIT CAKE.

YOUR COMMUNITY NEEDS
LEADERS; ARE YOU ONE?
The development of leaders in
community work is an important
rural need. Every community can
boast plenty of men well able to lead
the way in any important work, but
they are not leading because they are
too busy with their own affairs or
think they are.
It is not diificult to point out many
lines of helpful and profitable work
any given community should be do
ing, and farmers generally will agree
that such work is of importance, but
who is going to start it, and carry it
on after is is started? Such work
takes much time. There is too much
selfishness in these matters. We must
make ourselves more willing to give
I of our time freely to help others.
I Development of rural leaders is
.not a matter of taking a tender
I youth hy the hand and leading him to
j leadership. It is a matter of making
j the able old warhorse, talker, fight
jar. doer, see that he eaa well afford
to give goal* •t his lime to serve the
the tickets to the kids who will later
get dolls and toys from the proceeds.
I am further requested to an
nounce; ladies and gentlemen that
on the evening stated above, that the
celebrated, serpentine elephantine,
premier danseur. Mister Roseoe
(Fatty) Arbuckle will show you some
steps that Pavlowa, KoslofF and the
other celebrated dancers of the day

a two reel Triangle, "The Waiters
Ball" Fatty is the cook. The best

entirely unknown to the best cooks
of Morgan City.
In addition to this picture Wm. S.
Hart, said to be the best western ac
