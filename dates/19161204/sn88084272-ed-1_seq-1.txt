FfllLID ESCAPE
Five Attempt to Scale Wall
But Are Scared Down By
Close Rifle Fire.
Santa Fe. N. M.. Dec. 4. Dashing past
the prison guards as they unlocked the
steel cells to allow the cooks to pre
pare the morning meal, five convicts of
the state penitentiary made a bold at
tempt to scale the 18 foot brick walls
at 6 oclock Sunday morning and were
restrained from climbing up a blanket
ladder only after 40 shots had been
fired In their direction. So close did
some of the shots come to the convicts
as they were ascending to freedom that
dust from the bricks flew into their
faces. They finally surrendered and
were taken back to their cells.
The attempted jail delivery was one
of the most daring and cunningly
planned known to the penitentiary of
ficials. According to the custom fol
lowed for years, at 6 oclock the prison
guards unlocked the steel cell doors in
which slept the convicts who were de
tailed as cooks. In each cook's cell
there also was another convict. Not
suspecting any attempt at freedom, the I
guards allowed the cooks to pass out
when suddenly, by a reparranged plan,
the six other convicts dashed past the
guards and out into the yards. In a few
seconds the cook"s were locked in, the
kitchen. The guards then proceeded to
head off the jail breakers.

Premier's Speech Reveals
Agreement Made By Rus
sia and Her Allies.
Petrograd. Russia, Dec. 4 All classes
In Russia are today discussing the
announcement of premier Trepott In the
duma, Sunday in which he stated, that
an agreement entered into by Russia,
France and Great Britain In 1915 and
later approved by Italy, "established In
a definite manner the right of Russia
to Constantinople and the straits."
In his address to the duma, as given
out by the semi-official news agency,
premier Trepolt made the following
declaration concerning the Russian
policy in regard to the Polish questions.
"One part of the task before us is to
reconquer and recover the kingdom of
Poland, temporarily detached by force
of arms. But that is not enough. We
must also wrest from our enemies,
territories formerly Polish, beyond the
old frontier. We will then reconstitute
Poland, free within Its ethnographical
boundaries but inseparably united with
Russia."
No Sacrifice Too Great.
"There is no doubt that after she has
obtained sovereign possession of a free
passage into the Mediterranean. Russia
will grant freedom of navigation for
the Rumanian flag, which now, not for
the first time, floats in battle side by
side with the flag of Russia.
"I thought It my duty not to con
ceal from you the difficulties and sac
rifices which we have still to endure in
order to bring the present war to a
victorious conclusion, but rio difficulty
and no sacrifice will stop Russia and
her brave allies on the path of recon
struction and consolidation.
Xced Lnbor Of Everyone.
"Our heroic troops and fleet are do
ing their great -work without pause.
The first task which falls on the rest
of us is to devote all our strength and
every hour of our time to productive
work. Russia needs the common labor
of everyone, based on regular distribu
tion, according to individual capability.
It Is the patriotic duty of every one not
to undermine the country's power, but
to do his utmost to strengthen it The
history of the world has never known
so decisive a moment We must or
ganize all the power or the nation and
hurl It against the enemy. Nothing
will resist that force."
'Opposition Develonal
Vivid episodes in Saturday's session
of the duma, chief among which were
tne ODStructionist movement of some
members of the extreme left which
threatened to make premier - TrepofTs
declaration impossible, the announce
ment concerning the allies' agreement
to Russia's claim to Constantinople and
the straits and the sensational speech
of Vladimir Purlshkevich, vice presi
dent of the Union of True Russians,
have marked another chapter in the
conflict between the government and
the duma, but without providing any
satisfactory means of settlement
The meeting was, however, the most
significant demonstration of the ac
cumulative force which the duma has
acquired since the opening of the
present session. For the first time de
mands for a change in the character of
the present government were not only
voiced in unequivocal terms, leaving
not the slightest doubt, but were
allowed to be published in the news
papers. Cnnon In llankn Of foMerunirnf.

which it was agreed that both Mr. As

The correspondents understood that
Mr. Lloyd George favors a omall war
council which would not include Mr.
Asquith whp, he thinks, should devote
himself to the government of the
country apart from the war. Mr. Lloyd
George's proposed rale in the new war
council, would, according to the same
correspondent not greatly differ from
the position of Kitchener held in the

Charged With Conspiring
To Blow Up Munitions
Plants in TJ. S.
San Francisco. Cal, Dec. 4. Franz
Bopp. German consul general here; and
attaches of his oflce," together with
other defendants alleged to have been
employed by him, faced trial today In
the United States district court on
charges or conspiracy against the neu
trality of the United States. Bopp and
his compatriots are alleged by the gov
ernment to have planned to blow up
munition plants in America and Canada
and steamships carrying supplies to
the allies, together with railroad
bridges and military trains.
The activities of Bopp and the other
defendants are alleged to have extend
ed to various cities throughout the
United States and Canada, and to have
had their inception at or shortly after,
the beginning of the war. The case
attracted nation-wide attention early
last year when the alleged conspiracy
and the various outgrowths of it were
uneartnea rjy government agents.
Actions Consolidated.
Two actions are consolidated in the
present proceeding before William M.
Hunt sitting as United States district
judge, the informal charge being a
conspiracy against the neutrality laws
of the United States. Specifically the
charges are a violation of the act of
July 2, 1S90, by conspiring to restrain
interstate and foreign commerce by
destroying factories, railroads .and
steamships.
The other action is for violation of
twHnn. 13 anri 37 Af fh CnlrnH Rtnt.
criminal code in conspiring to begin
pare means for military enterprise to
be carried on from within the United
States against the territory and domin
ion of the king of Great Britain and
Ireland.
Two Barons) Also Defendants.
Besides Bopp the defendants include:
Baron E. M. von Srhack. vice consul:
baron Wilhelm von Brlncken, J. F. van
Koolbergen, Margaret E. Cornell.
Charles C Crowley and Louis J. fcmith.
The latter will be one of the chief
witnesses for the government, having
been promisee immunity for giving his
testimony. Van Koolbergen probably
will not be present as he succeeded in
getting out of the country, his offence
not being extraditable.
One of the specific Sets of. violence
charged against the defendants was
thb blowing up of a barge of war mu
nitions in Seattle harbor in May. 1915.
These munitions were alleged to have
been consigned to Russia. Crowley,
a former head of a detective service
of the Southern Pacific railroad, and
Smith were accused of being directly
concerned in this.

troduced today by representative Fitz
gerald of New York, when congress
convened. Two proposed food embargo.
One would regulate transportation of
cold storage fods and anther would
regulate the admission ot farm pro
ducts and manufactured food stuffs
to the parcel post and reduce the rates
of food.
"The enactment of either of the bills.'"
said representative Fitzsrerald. will
bring immediate relief to the country.
The people want action: they are heart
ily tired of talk ana investigation."
A mass of petitions was fUl-in-favor
of the legislation;
Flood of Bills Bcsrina.
Todays opening was .-marked by a.
flood -of bills and resolutions, many of
which" are expected to- die' in committee
with the congress itself on March 4.
The energies of the administration
leaders were at once concentrated on
the passage of the big supply hills
necessary for conduct of the govern
nent and upon the -limited program of
general legislation.
Speaker Clark declared the next
house, on the basis of the last election
would show at least 216 Democrats
without Scully, of New Jersey, or
Beakes, of Michigan. He conceded 213
to the Republicans. These figures do
not Include the independent group of
fcur which with the two in doubt
make a total of 435.
"We have the control of, the house
without any doubt" he said. Led by
vice president Marshall, many senators
and representatives called- at the white
hcuse to pay their respects to president
Wilson but he was. out golfing.
Flan Fast: Work.
With the prospect of a much, reduced
majority in the new house, or possibly
a line up so close that Democratic con
trol will be In doubt, admnlistratlon
leaders have laid their plans to work
at high speed In the hope of enacting
the most important part of their pro
gram before it is endangered in the
65 th congress.
Foremost is completion of president
Wilson's railroad legislation program
left unfinished at the last session with,
the passage of the Adamson law. The
remainder of the program, which the
president will press, includes supple
mentary legislation to prevent such. a.
nation wide railway strike as was
threatened last summer, or. in fact, a
lockout, until the situation has been
investigated.
Food Embswro Considered.
Second in importance comes the agi
tation for a restriction of shipments
of foodstuffs to Europe, Thousands
of petitions asking for an embarso
have been received by members of
congress and at the white house. In
every case it is argued that the in
creased cost of living in the United
I creased cost of living
States demands a restriction of ship
ments abroad. So far as has been dis
closed president Wilson and members
of the cabinet have no plans for acting
on the subject, but it is known that
various members of congress intend to
push the subject' and it may develop
a fight Chairman Fitzgerald ot the
appropriations committee already has
announced his intention of introducing
I u- Diu ior a tooa emoargo.
Woman suffragists, renewing their
fight for passage of the Susan B.
Anthony amendment to the constitu
tion, have laid all the line3 for then
campaign, and it is possible that then
demands may be crowded into the short
time congress has to deal with an Im
portant budget of legislation. Prohi
bitionists, no less ardent than the suf
fragists, in their demand for a federal
amendment are expected to begin their
fight anew.
Man's Monopoly Gone,
Today's opening marks the closing
of man's monopoly of membership in
the house of representatives. In the
next congress the clerks, the pages and
the speaker will be calling: "The Lady
frorn Montana." Miss Jeaneitee Ran
kin, Republican, first woman elgcted
to congress, is expected to be. in her
seat' then. She does not sit ih the
present session although many unin
formed expected to see her today but
comes Jn with the new congress. When
sh does arrive the house will be con
fronted with revising its own rules to
give her a place on the floor.

members to take the oath of office.
