Month of November Reveals
a 7y2 Per Cent Increase
Over Last Year.
30 STORES REPORT
Journalism Students Make
Chart of the Town's Re
tail Conditions.
Thirty retail establishments in Co
lumbia did on an average of 74 per
cent more business in November this
year than in the same month in 1915.
The largest increase, 50 per cent
was reported by a department store
and a grocery. The largest decrease
of any store was 30 per cent
These figures were obtained In a
report prepared by students In the
School of Journalism for the Associat
ed Advertising Clubs of the World,
which last year i named Columbia as
one of the retail centers of the United
States. The statistics of all towns
making reports will be compiled and
published for the benefit of the busi
ness men of the country.
One Columbia department store re
ported an increase of 80 per cent in
Its volume of stock; a Jewelry store
with an increase of 75 per cent was
second. The greatest decrease in the
volume of stock in November of this
year as compared with November of
"ast year was 10 per cent, which was
reported by a Jewelry store. The
average increase in volume of stock
was 11J4 per cent
A department store and a grocery
store each reported an increase of 50
per cent in their profits for Novem
ber, 1916, over November, 1915. A
jewelry store claims a loss of 75 per
cent of Its profits. The average in
crease in profits is 4 "per cent.
The thirty retailers collected 62"4
per cent of their October book ac
counts, during the month of Novem
ber. A hardware and a clothing store,
each reporting a collection of 20 per
cent, collected the smallest percent
age. Some of the stores conduct their
business on a cash basis; their collec
tions of 100 per cent were included
in figuring the average.
Advertising appropriations are about
the same. The records show in many
cases that an Increase in advertising
is accompanied by an increase In
sales. The largest increase In sales,
50 per cent, was made by a firm that
increased its advertising 25 per cent
In another line of goods one firm
increased its advertising appropria
tion 60 per cent and realized a greater
per cent of increase in sales and prof
it than any other Columbia store
handling that class of goods.
Some of the retailers interviewed
were unwilling to give the percentages
asked and in some instances the books
'vcre not in condition for reliable re
ports. Those who were able to fur
nish the information requested are as
sured by the Associated Advertisers
mat tney are doing that much to help
better merchandising.
