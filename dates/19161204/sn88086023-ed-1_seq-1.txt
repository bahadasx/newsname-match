Demanding Embargoes and
Regulation of Cold Storage.
WILSQMMESSAGETOMORROW
Senator Borah Plans to Present Mea
sure Tomorrow Repealing Sections
of Army Reorganization Bill.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 4. Congress
reconvened at noon. Representative
Fitzgerald Introduced two bills de
manding food export embargoes and
two asking regulation of cold storage
and a reduction of parcel post food
charges. Representative Farr pro
posed a wheat embargo. ' London of
New York, a socialist, suggested a vir
tual food dictatorship.
Both houses passed resolutions no
tifying President Wilson of the ses
sion and announcing their readiness
to hear his message tomorrow.
Crowded galleries cheered Speaker
Clark as he pounded for order. -
Martiue Ha Food Embargo BUI.
Senator Martine announced his in
tention of introducing a food embargo
bill later. Senator Owen will intro
duce a bill demanding a rigid investi
gation of all presidential campaign
expenditures.
Senator Borah plans to present
measure tomorrow repealing sections
of the army reorganization biU regu
lating the militia.
Four hundred thousand ' members
of the maintenance departments of
American railways filed a congresslo'
nal petition demanding that they be
included "In any eight hour railroad
legislation."
When Introducing his bills Fitz
gerald said: "Multiplying evidences of
the widespread interest in the higb
cost of living make me, hopeful of
success. The enactment of any of my
bill will bring immediate relief. The
people want action and are heartily
tired of talk and investigation."
Four Bills Explained.
The first bill provides a flat one
year embargo on all exportation ol
farm products and manufactured
foodstuffs. The second bill enables
the president to suspend the exporta
tion whenever prices become extor
tionate. The third prohibits interstate
shipments of foods, except butter.
when stored over ten months, ine
fourth abolishes parcel post zones
governing the mailing of farm pro
ducts, and manufactured foodstuffs,
and admits such goods to parcel post
at three cents for the first pound and
one cent each additional, up to one
hundred and fifty pounds.
The bill makes exemptions in em
bargoes whenever American citizens
and diplomats abroad need food. It
also exempts shipments to war fam
ine sufferers.
Extremely high penalties are im
posed. Representative London said:
"I believe we should have govern
mental control of the food situation.
An embargo Is only an Incidental pro
position. It should be introduced if
it will help lower living costs. We
should also have a system of govern
ment control, like the Australian sys
tem."
'Parasite Speculators" Hit,
Lindberg of Minnesota, introduced
a bill attacking "parasite speculators"
and proposing a general embargo
bill for Joint house and senate con
sideration. Many representatives
from farm districts strongly attacked
the proposed embargo, threatening
munition embargoes if any attempt
was made to Interfere with their pros
perity. Emerson of Cleveland, offered a
resolution asking the secretary of
agriculture to report on the advisa
bility of a wheat embargo and the
possibility of reducing the living cost
by reducing railroad food shipments
tariffs.
Senator Lewis of Illinois, promised
further senate action. He said he
would Introduce a bill empowering
the government to seize food when a
corner was attempted and Veselling
to the public at the lowest cost.

Iioyd-George Falls to Appear at
Parliament 'Session.
LONDON'. Dec 4 premier As
quith formally told the House of Com
mons that the King had consented to
a "reconstruction of the govern
ment." The Immediate steps were
not announced. Asquith suggested
that all members postpone questions
regarding the changes until Thursday.
Ine announcement followed a lengthy
conference between the King and As.
quitn.
Asquith declared that whatever re
construction was necessary, the gov
ernment' war policy would remain
unchanged. Britain will continue
fighting until Belgium Is restored and
German militarism is subdued.
It is currently reported that recon
struction means a general change of
tbe entire cabinet. Apparently
Lloyd-George has precipitated a cabi
net crisis, by demanding a small, com
pact body for handling the' war.
Intense popular Interest waa mani
fested when parliament met. Gov
ernment official packed the floor and
galleries. Austen Chamberlain, sec
retary for India, was the only cabinet
member present One member asked
Lord Cecil whether he could assure
the house the Greek dynasty would
be preserved. Cecil did not reply.
The Commons later adjourned un
til Thursday without formally voting
an adjournment motion. Irish mem
bers vainly protested. Lloyd-George
failed to appear. It Is believed his
absence Indicated his determination
to remain away until definite changes
are announcd.
After Asquith's address. Sir H.
Dalziel said he understood all cabinet
members had handed their resigna
tions to the premier. Asquith did not
