Go After Dealers Under Crimi
nal Law Is Flan.
One of the first demands on the
state legislature by Governor Capper
will be for the appointment of a joint
committee of the house and senate to
Investigate the high cost - f food
stuffs. Unless there is material re
duction in living prices during: the
next few weeks, the governor declared
today that he would ask for a legis
lative probe of conditions. In the
meantime he believes that the great
est defense of the consumer lies in
the systematic boycott of all food
stuffs that have taken the sensational
increa :e in prices
Governor Caliper stated today that
he is personally investigating living
conditions that he mayjbe prepared to
submit a definite and clear-cut state
ment to the legislatu . He is posi
tive existing conditions are due to
combinations and agreements of food
speculators who are compelling con
sumers to pay exorbitant and unwar
ranted prices. Conditions in this
country do not warrant present prices,
the governor believes, and defense of
the man who pays the grocery bills
lies in a refusal to buy meats, eggs
and other provisions which have been
subject to the greatest Increase In
prices. If Kansas dealers are in any
wr y responsible for conditions, the
governor declares that the state will
act on ndings by the legislature.
o Reason for It.
"For sometime I have been study
ing conditions surrounding the high
cost of liing with a view of laying the
matter before the legislature. GoveT
nro Capper stated. "Condiitons are
most certainly abnormal. There is
seemingly no reason tor present prices
on many commodities and existing
prices are most certainly due to one
reason a combination or speculators
who seek to make unwarranted and
tinjusti fieri pro! its at the expense of
the consumer.
"t'nlfss conditions in the next few
i
better. I shall certainly take the mat-
xer nerore me legislature, just now
T am contemplating a provision in ry
message asking for a joint investiga
tion 1 y the house and senate o' con
ditions. If Kansas dealers or specula
tors are found to he in any manner
responsible for conditions, the state
shall certainly proceed under the
criminal law."
SuKsest noyoott.
Governor Capper was asked con
cerning his sentiments regarding an
organized and genernl boycott ot pro
ducts affected by alleged manipula
tions of food speculators
"A boycott is not pleasant sounding,
but it is probably the most effective !
weapon in the hands of the consumer.
said the governor. "I believe consum
ers should refuse to purchase provis
ions affected by present manipulations.
The defense of consumer at this time
seems to lie in such action. But if the
state thru its legislature and detiart
ments can do anything to relieve exist-
ing conditions, such action shall cer
tainly be taken.

Washisntnn, Dec. 4. Congress as
sembled promptly at noon today for
the short session which will mark the
closing of President Wilson's first
term.
With a crowded proerram of legis
lation, foremost in which is the presi
dent's plan for railroad legislation,
senators and representatives settled
down to work as Speaker Clark and
Vice President Marshall brought down
their gavels.
Today's open'ng was marked by the
usual flood of bills and resolutions,
many of which are expected to die
in committee with the congress itself
on March 4.
The energies of the administration
leaders were at once concentrated on
the pass-age of the big supply bills

Congress Tomorrow.
Washington, Dec. 4. Congress re
assembles today with three months re
maining in which to complete the leg
islative plans of the first administra
tion of President Wilson.
With prospect of a much reduced
majority in the new house, or possibly
a line up so close that Democratic con
trol will be In doubt, administration
leaders have laid their plans to work
at high speed in the hope of enact
ing the most important part of their
program before it is endangered in
the Sixty-fifth congress.
Foremost is completion of President
Wilson s railroad legislation program
left unfinished at the last session with
the passage of the Adamson law. The
remainder of the program, which the
president will press, includes supple
mentary legislation to prevent such a
nation wide railway strike as was
threatened last summer, or in fact a
lockout, until the situation has been
investigated.
Second in importance to the railway
situation comes the agitation for a re
striction of shipments of foodstuffs to
Europe. Thousands of petitions ask
ing for an embargo have been received
by members of congress and at the
White House. In every case it is ar
gued that the increased cost of living
in the United States demands a restric
tion of shipments abroad. So far as
has been disclosed President Wilson
and members of the cabinet have no
plans for acting on the subpject, but
it is known that various members of
congress intend to push the subject
and it may develop a fight. Chairman
Fitzgerald of the appropriations com
mittee already has announced his in
tention of introducing a bill for a food
embargo. - .-

FLY TO NEW YORK
,Phil Billard Asks Governor for
! Financial Aid.
i
iTopeka Aviator Would Adver-
tise Kansas on Trip.
Capt. Phil Billard has asked Gov
ernor Capper to aid In financing an
aeroplane trip from Topeka to New
York City. Governor Capper doesn't
feel that he could back such an ex
cellent Kansas advertising scheme
alone but has issued a statement, urg
ing the people of the state to do all in
their power to encourage the Topeka
aviator and at the same time lauds
the Longren machine and Captain
Billard's flving ability. Following is
the governor's statement.
"Cantafn "Rillard deserves encour
agement. I could not undertake the
financing of such a flight to New
York, but if the Chamber of Com
merce and two or three other such or
ganizations back the movement I see
no reason why it cannot De accom-
plished. Captain Billard is practical
and he seems
to have an
excellent
machine."
Crowd Out Sunday,
All Topeka seems afflicted 'With the
aviation bug following Captain Bil
lard's spectacular flight to Kansas
City Thanksgiving. Sunday the avia
tion field was swarming with avia
tion fans, some desiring a trip in the
aeroplane and others wishing to see
all they could of the machine which
has been soaring over their heads re
cently
Dan Cupid mixed in with the avia
tor's plans Sunday afternoon and
made it possible for Captain Billard to
make $53 for a 53-minutes flight. L.
F. Piper, 12 37 Tyler street, expressed
a desire to fly to Hoyt and circle
around the home of the lady of his
choice. Captain Billard took him
above the clouds where mother earth
nothing but a memory. Then they
dipped down over the girl's home, cir
cled around two or three times and
returned to Topeka.
Flew Over City.
All in Topeka craned their necks as
Billard flew over the city. Upon his
arrival at the aviation field Billard
had more trouble in lighting than he
did in flying, due to the enthusiasm
of the fans- who swarmed over the
field. It was almost impossible for
him to make a landing. Ralph D.
Montgomery, superintendent of the
Santa Fe time service, accompanied
Billard on his next flight. This was
the most spectacular of the day. Bil
lard flew 3.000 feet up in the air over
Topeka and then made a dip of prob
ably 2,000 feet. Dusk was gathering
and many witnessing the dip from
Topeka thought the machine had turn
ed over. Wayne Horning of Grant
ville, and C. P. Olander of Topeka,
were others who accompanied the
aviator on shprt flights.
"There are others who wish to go
up." said Captain Billard today.
He is undecided whether he will fly
any more this year. The machine will
be taken in either todav or tomorrow.

CLINGS TO SCREAM THEORY
Says Prosecutor Tried to Evade
Coroner's Inquest.
'They've Proven Nothing," Is
McDaniel's Comment.
St. Joe, Dec. 4. Fearing exposure
that would result from separation
with his wife, Oscar D. McDaniel,
public prosecutor, murdered Harriet
Moss McDaniel, according to the
state's opening argument by Bart M.
Lockwood, special prosecutor, In the
criminal court here today.
"It is the old, .old motive that has
caused wife murders thruout all
time," Lockwood said. "Here is a
man of great reputation for honesty,
who held a high office and social po
sition. What greater motive could
there be than for a man in such a
high position suddenly to see his pin
nacle about to be shattered and his
life exposed because of a threatened
separation with his wife?"
McDaniel's story was characterized
as a "frame-up." The word "rot" was
used time after time by Lockwood, as
he endeavored to tear down the testi
mony given by i fense witnesses.
The accused man, seated beside his
three children, was not visibly affect
ed. During a morning recess he said
to friends:
"I am not discouraged over the out
come. Nothing has been said or
shown yet that is not compatible with
a theory of innocence."
The accused man was the last of
the actors in the trial to enter the
court room. Other members of his
family, his two smallest children, his
father, mothej, sisters and brothers
already were in their, places behind
the defense counsel when McDaniel
entered with Odell, his 12-year-old
son.
Both Families There.
Mrs. Sarah Moss, Miss Aileene Moss
and Hayden Moss, mother, sister and
brother of the slain woman, sat in
their accustomed eats besides attor
neys for the prosecution. All seats in
the court room were filled and many
stood wherever room could be found.
As Judge Ryan began reading the
jury instructions. Marion, the accused
man's 6-year-old, climbed on his fath
er's knees and sat there thruout the
reading. Helen, the 8-year-old
daughter, and Odell were on either
side of their grey-haired grandfather.
The instructions set forth that a
conviction either of first or second
degree murder was the only alterna
tive other than acquittal for the jury
finding. The remainder were con
sidered by attorneys as routine.
The instruction contained eighteen
provisions and the reading required .
almost thirty minutes. Seventeen of
them were objected to by defense
counsel hut the objection was over
ruled by Judge Ryan.
Bart M. Lockwood, special prosecu
tor made the opening argument for the
state, beginning af 10 o'clock.
"It has been insinuated T had ulter
ior motives in this case." he said.
"Gentlemen of he jury, that is for you
to determine, but, under the law, it is
no defense.
Lockwood Irofesses Regret.
"No one in this court room has more
sorrow than I have that Oscar Mc
Daniel is charged with the crime.
When I came into this case. July 20,
I did not know McDaniel would be
accused.
"But on the same day. Judge Strop
and Mr. Gabbert became attorneys for
the defense. Why, I ask you, did this
man obtain attorneys immediately I
was appointed special prosecutor?
"This de'endant is charged with one
of the most horrible and atrocious
crimes ever committed. Oscar, how
could you do it? That was the ques
tion that first entered our minds. But
now it is Oscar, did you do it?"
Lockwood painted a picture of Mc
Daniel's early home life "Happy,
successful, a brilliant man married to
a wonderful woman.
"It seemed that anything' he wished
could be his." Lockwood. said. "The
governor's chair, a seat in congress
anything it seemed could be his. Then
something occurred to break up his
ambitions and happiness.
"And he says a robber killed his
wife. But, gentlemen of the jury,
when McDaniel was on the stand, he
failed to mention that a single thing
had been stolen."
Attacks McDaniel's Story.
Lockwood attacked McDaniel's story
of the murder night, outlining the
state's view of the disposition of fur
niture in the bedroom in, which Mrs.
McDaniel was slain. He said she had
been killed on the bed altho he quoted
McDaniel as having said she was
found on the floor wnen he returned
home about midnight.
"Was it possible for McDaniel to
pick up that unconscious form, place

WHITE PAPER CRISIS
Threatens to Put 2,000 Newspapers
V Out of Business.
The white paper crisis pending is so
critical that, according to the Ameri
can Newspaper Publishers' associa
tion, thousands of daily newspapers
will be crippled and 2,000 are likely to
be put out of business.
The situation is so clearly put in a
"double-leaded" editorial under the
heading "The WTiite'Paper Crisis," in
the Kansas City" Star of Saturday that
it is republished here, as' follows:
"The White Paper Crisis."
"White paper is the newspaper's
raw material. It is like the leather
of the shoe manufacturpr, or the lum
ber of the furniture factory. The
newspaper . takes the white paper,
stamps it with ink, divides the prod
uct into packages and sells them.
This blank paper is by far the biggest
single item in the cost of producing
a newspaper of large circulation. Con
sequently the unprecedented and
enormous advance in the price of
white paper has made an acute crisis
in the publishing business.
"A newspapt. like The Star, for in
stance, that uses twenty-five thousand
tons of white paper a year, is now
confronted with a white paper cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars in
excess of that of last year.
"This increased expense would put
virtually every newspaper in the
United States out of business if it were
unable to find some extraordinary
means of increasing its revenue. All
newspapers have been forced to ad-,
vance their advertising rates. Some in
addition have increased their subscrip
tion price. Those that have not done
this have figured that advertising, in
relation to service rendered by the
newspaper, is cheaper now than ever
before. For with the growth of news
paper circulation the advertiser in the
Star, for instance, is getting more
readers for every dollar he spends
than ever in his whole business his
tory. A general increase in advertis
ing rates thruout the country was
therefore normally due. It has only
been somewhat hastened by the crisis
in white paper.
"Ordinarily newspapers do not con
sider their business arrangements of
any particular interest to the public,
which is concerned solely with service.
But the widespread acuteness of the
present situation, which, according to
the American Publishers' association,
is likely to put perhaps two thousand
newspapers out of business, gives the
matter a public aspect, and is suffi
cient warrant for its discussion.'
MARINES IN BATTLE
Cnited States Force Have Clash With
Santo Domingo Natives.
Washington. Dec. 4, -In an encoun
ter between American marines and
natives at Macoris, Santo Domingo,
November 29, a number were wounded
on both sides. The heaviest losses
were suffered by the Dominicans.; The
affair was reported to the navy de
partment today by Captain Knapp,
commanding the forces in Haiti and
Santo Domingo.
The dispatch said no Americans
were killed and that only a few ma
rines were injured. It did not indi
cate the number of native losses. The
fight occurred while the American
forces were investing Macorisi, dis
arming the natives and establishing
themselves in accordance with the
military rule recently proclaimed.
GUARD'S DEATH MYSTERY
Missing Since Oct. 18, Body Is Found
in Rio Grande.
El Paso, Dec. 4. The body of Stan
ley L. Bogart, private in the Thirty
second Michiga.n National Guard, who
has been missing since October 18,
was found yesterday in the Rio Grande
opposite Juarez.
The cause of his death is a mystery
as there are no marks of violence on
the body. Bogart enlisted at Muske
gon. He left no names of relatives.
MILER JJETS JOB
City Detective Appointed Un
dersheriff by Larimer.
He Is Well Known in Law En
forcement Circles.
Hugh Larimer, sheriff-elect of
Shawnee eounty, today announced the
appointment of Robert Miler as under
sheriff. Miler will take the place now
held by Larimer when the. latter takes
the sheriffs office. Miler has been
"doped" for the place since soon after
the election. He is well known in law
enforcement circles and is looked upon
generally as one of the most com
petent officers in this section. He has
done exceptional work upon several
big cases.
Miler came to Topeka years ago
from Leoti, Kan., and was called back
afterwards to serve as marshal during
a period when the western town was
infested by tough characters.
When he returned to Topeka
he joined the Topeka police de
partment and served for several years
as patrolman. Then he went to Kan
sas City and served as a patrolman for
eleven months. He was then taken into
the detective branch in Kansas City
and stayed there for three years.
Special Santa Fe Agent.
The Santa Fe Railway company
took Miler away from the Kansas City
department and appointed him as spe
cial agent in charge of the eastern
division. From that he went to the
Chicago terminals and had charge of
all the special agents working there.
Nearly two years ago Miler suffered
an attack that required a serious op
eration. He was in the hospital for
months and when he was released he
was unable to go back to his old
job. He returned to Topeka and
was placed upon the local depart
ment as a detective. He has held
that position under Chief Harvey
Parsons for about nine months and
will go from it to the office of under-
sheriff.
Chief Parsons has stated that it was
a lucky day for Topeka's department
when "Bob" Miler was unable to go
back to the strenuous work required
by the Santa Fe.

Mr. Wolff about the arrangement the
following morning and that a big row
was the result.
She charges that Wolff struck her.
beat her over a table and forcibly
ejected her from a room. She claims
a part of the damages because of an
