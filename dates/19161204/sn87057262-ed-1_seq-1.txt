three month's grind.
It faced President Wilson's mandate
for completion of unfinished railway
legislation, it had budgets of millions

get out political axes for the coming
months will doubtless witness fights
that will be historically important.
Two subjects—railroad legislation
and the foot price problem, sounded
out above the din of the welcome home
squads.
President Wilson has secured the
co-operation of Speaker Clark and
Majority Leader Kitchin in a plan to
expedite consideration of railway sub
jects. On this point the labor element
plans to stir up the lions by fighting
the proposal for investigation of labor
troubles with an automatic stop to
strikes pending such inquiry.
At the best it probably will be late
In the session before these measures
can come up for routine business will
be long in the works. Estimates for
over a billion were to go in today.
Congress will cull over these figures,
especially those affecting public build

Weeks to come.
To expedite matters, congress will
work through the Christmas holidays—
unless the majority rebels. Most of
the members were on hand today,
though many will not arrive until to
morrow in time to hear President il
son's message. This is understood to
make no recommendations about re
lieving the high cost of living, though
the president probably will make that
the subject of another message soon,

CHICAGO, Dec. 4.—The story of
Charles H. Wax, under arrest here
today, clears the mystery of the sen
sational $50,000 breach of promise
suit by Miss Rae Tanzier, a pretty
milliner, against James W. Osborne,
former assistant district attorney of
New York City and noted criminal
lawyer.
Wax, who is a graduate of the uni
versity of Columbia Medical school
class of '07, says he 1b the "Oliver Os
borne" who taught Miss Tanzer to
enjoy the gaieties of New York night
life. Miss Tanzier brought suit in
March 1915, against James W. Os_
borne. Osborne, who is over fifty and
has a family, denied he had even seen
the girl.
Wax, wanted as a material wit
ness in the case denied today he had
played anything but an innocent role
in the suit against Osborne.
"I was going under the name of
Oliver Osborn in 1914 wlien I met
Miss Tanzier," lie said. "I picked her
up through a street flirtation at Col
umbus Circle, New York. Wo saw
each other several times after that.
"In 1915 I read in the newspapers
that Miss Tanzier had filed suit for
$50,000 against Osborne. I went to
Osborne and told him I was the man
she really meant to file suit against.
I met his wife there and assured her
that her husband was a victim of a
mistake. Both of us remarked at
that time of the resemblance between
Osborne and myself."
Wax is said to have a police rec
ord in many cities. He said he didn't

Wax has operated his clever games

SHAL VON MACKENSBN, FIFTY
KILOMETERS FROM BUCHAREST*
Dec. 1. (Via Berlin and Sayville wire
less, Dec. 4.)—German troops today
were within ten miles of Bucharest.
The 'Rumanian retreat is so precipi*
tate that German advance columna
on Thursday and Friday hotly pur
suing them, lost touch with the Ger
man infantry backing them up. The
slower moving infantry was unable
to keep up with the advance column
in pursuit.
Officer^ all declare the morale ofr
the Rumanians is completely broken.
It is not expected they will be able
seriously to defend their capital.
Field Marshal Von Mackensen and
General Falkenhayn, however, are
taking jio chances. Every road lead"
ing toward Bucharest from the south,
the west and the north is packed with
German, Austrian, Hungarian and
Turkish troops, carrying all equlp
naent necessary for a siege of the city.
[The above dispatch was dated
Friday and puts the German forces
encircling Bucharest closer to their
mark on Friday than had even beert
hinted at in official statements.
Ackerman's dispatch was written
Decemoer 1. Since that time, Russian,
official statements have detailed a'
strenuous effort by Russian forces to
stem the tide of this advance. That
point of greatest menace to Bucharest)
was to the south—and this is probably
the section where Ackerman's dispatch.
puts the German forces within ten/
miles of the capital.
The Russian statement of last nighfc
claimed retirement of the German-:
Bulgarian forceB in this section after
defeat and capture by the allied forces
of prisoners and booty, including at/
least twenty-six guns.
In the light of Ackerman's dispatch,
indicating that the German advanced
skirmishers were pursuing the Ruman
ians so hotly that they had lost contact
with the infantry forces backing them
up, the Russian victory becomes more
apparent.
Presumably it was this advance
skirmish guard upon which Russian
and Rumanian troops inflicted defeat,
probably because of the very fact that
they lacked infantry backing.]
