j. i Petrograd, Dec. 4, via London, 11:55a. m. The war of-
If'ice announces that the Teutonic forces have occupied that
village of Gradichtea, south of Bucharest. Obstinate fighting
is progressing between Alexandria and Bucharest.
Gradichtea is 1 2 miles south of Bucharest.
I j Field Marshal von Mackcnsen's
' . drive against Bucharest from the
5 southwest and south Is again In full '
j ) swing. Its stoppage by the Russo-Ru-1
I manian offensive in this sector, re
! ; ported yesterda', was evidently only
i; i temporary, for Petrograd today an
'! nounces .occupation of Gradichtea by
I . the Teutonic forces. Gradichtea is on
; i tho Glurgiu-Bucharest railway line di
rectly south of Bucharest and its cap
ture places Von Mackensen's advance
within a scant 12 miles of the capital.
On the northwest, the Rumanians
) are also falling back under General
1 ') von Falkenhayn's pressure. They are
,1 ;. reported on the retreat in the Piteshtl
i Tergovlstea sector, marking a further
j closing in of the invaders, driving
down from tho mountain passes.-
The situation in Rumania, still the
. ! chief center of military interest, does
i, ' not appear markedly less critical for
. the Rumanians despite the reported
) success of the Russo-Rumanian offen-
slve southwest of Bucharest In hold-
ing back, temporarily at least, Field
i ' Marshal von Mackensen's invading
! J forces.
I Bucharest and the armies defending
it continues under a serious threat,
not only from the forces from the
southwest, but also from those along
the lino of the Argechu, stretching
northwestward to Plteshti and from
General von Falkenhayn's armies
1 ) pressing southward from the mountain
I 1 passes, on tho line turning abruptly at
; Plteshti and extending northwestward,
' north of the Rumanian capital.
i' The force of tho converging attack
' : thus being pressed from three sides of
) Bucharest does not appear to have
; ! diminished, but the resisting powers
of tho Rumanian troops, reinforced by
! -: Russian forces seems to have strength
i' ened somewhat. Upon their resistance
( depends further breaks in the Ru-
manian lines and not only the safety
J j of Bucharest, but the main Rumanian
j ? armies engaged within the angle of the
; Teutonic thrust.
!. Serbians Capture Heights.
" The Serbians have renewed their
j ; successful advance in Macedonia, cap-
1 I turlng a height north of Grunishte and
' ': driving the Bulgarians In the direction
of Stravina, four miles to the north-
i i east, according to the French war of-
flee statement today. Desperate bat-
' ! ties have been in progress for some
ff days In this region, which lies beyond
i j the Cerna river, east of Monastlr. Ber-
l Un yesterday declared that the hill po-
i " sitions near Grunishto were still firmly
r : in the hands of the Germano-Bulgarian
' forces.
' Revolt In Antwerp.
Unconfirmed reports through Hol
ij ' land tell of a revolt In Antwerp on No
il bomber 30 arising from the deporta
j i tion of Belgians to Germany in which
t I 200 to 300 Inhabitants and many Ger
i? ' man soldiers are said to have been
tj killed.
The British cabinet problem appears
? in process of solution with the belief
J prevailing that the coalition govern-
t ment under Premier Asquith has been
