BABE OF SENATE.
Washington, Dee. 4.—W. F.
Kirby of Arkansas was tiie baby
of the United States senate when
it convened for the short session
today. He was introduced by
Senator Robinson as the man
named to fill thje unexpired term
of the late Senator Clarke. Ap­
plause from his senatorial col
leagues greeted the appearance
of the legislative infant.

ittepresenta-
tlve Fitzgerald and his threatened
food embargo legislation was the
center of interest when the C4th con­
gress convened for its dying session
at noon today.
Representative Fitzgerald started
the legislative proposals to shatter
the high cost of living as congress
opened. Representative. Fitzgerald in­
troduced four plans two for food em­
bargoes and two for regulation of cold
storage companies and reduction of
parcel post charges for transportation
of food.
Some More Pork.
Congress aslted for $32,028,000 for
rivers and harbors improvements for
the year ending Juiie,, 1911. l-ast
year over $42,069,OOO. 'More than a
quarter of a million is askgd for Mia*
slssippl river improvement.
Senator Owen of Oklahoma says
that he will Introduce a bill tomorrow
for .UMNptsM InwsiiK&wm th« ft
penditnre of all money during the
presidential campaign. He intimates
there will be no immunity bath-and
there may be perjury charges.
Fitsgerald's declaration late in No­
vember that he would, introduce a
resolution for a.food embargo to keep
products in the JJnited States and- re­
duce the cost of-living:stirred up a
political hornet's nest.
Aside from the possibility of the
embargo itself, Fitzgerald's action, if
he takes it, may portend a fight be­
tween supporters of President Wilson,
who is against an embargo, and the
Tammany delegation, whose leader is
Fitzgerald.
Attitude of Tammany.
Both members and gallery in the
house watched with interest for any
indication of the attitude of the Tanv
many delegation toward the Demo­
cratic machine. Any move by the
Tammanyites would be the'more sig­
nificant because they hold the balance
of power in the house.
Representatives fronr west and mid
die west farm districts were absolute­
ly alert for auy^factfloniU split on the
threatened embargo resolution. They
are opposed to it and have threatened
that if it is introduced they will com­
bat it with a retaliatory measure call­
ing for an embargo on manufactured
articles such as constitute the bulk
of the export&tions to Europe from
the eastern manufacturing states.
Packed galleries greeted the gavels
of Speaker Clark and Vice President
.Marshall as chattering members of
both houses, in .most cases meeting
lor the first time since the eventful
day in early September when they
rushed through the Adamson eight
hoiirjiiw. turned to hear the familiar
admonition to "foe in order."
Little Business.
fvittle business was expected today.
Interest centered principally on the
floor of the house and senate cham­
bers and in the_galleries—a mass of
color, its membership made up of
members of the White House family,
diplomats, families and friends of con­
gressmen, and the populace crowding
the public galleries.
Senator Callinger and Senator
Kern, Republican and Democratic
floor leaders, respectively, were nam
ed senate members of the joint com
mittee to notify President Wilson
that congress was ready to hear him.
The house named as its members
Majority Leader Kitchin, Minority
Leader Mann and Representative Fitz­
gerald, chairman of the appropria
tions committee.
No time is set for the president's
message to congress. In the last few
years this has been on the day follow­
ing the convening—which would be
tomorrow, probably at 1:00 p. m.
With the prospect of«a much reduc­
ed majority in the new house, or pos­
sibly a line-up so close That Demo­
cratic control will be in doubt, ad­
ministration leaders have laid their
plans to work at high speed in the
hope of enacting the most important
part of their program 'before it is en­
dangered in the Sixty-fifth congress.
Foremost is completion of President
Wilson's railroad legislation program
left unfinished at the last session with
the passage of the Adamson law. The
remainder of the program, which the
president will press, includes supple­
mentary legislation to prevent such
a nation-wide jaHway strike as was
threatened lasysummer. or, in fact, a

Play Role
Saccharine postal card messages,
barrels and barrels'of beer, butcher
knives, dry goods-bills for corsets and
kimonas and such, charge and coun­
ter-charge, and several thousand
pages of evidence far more spicy
than anything the Smart Set has yet
dared to publish, feature the 'Rose
Katherine Hoellinger—John Iloeiling­
er divorce suit, which has just been
brought to the supreme court from
Ward county. Property to the value
of some $50,000 is involved, /as wfell
as the custody of a 16-year-old daugh­
ter. John Hoellinger, the defendant,
owns the Hoellinger block, the Wind­
sor hotel and considerable other
property- in MinOt. In r.ilie. Ward
county district court,Judge Frank E.
Flak, sitting for Judge Leighton,
awarded Mrs. Rose Katherine Hoel
linger about half the mutual proper­
ty of the family, and at the same time
gave John ari absolute decree of di­
vorce, on the grounds of extreme cru­
elty. The defendant, who appeals,
seems satisfied with the divorce, but
does not relish the division of prop­
erty.
Real Lovin' Talk.
Real lovin' talk characterizes the
postal cards addressed to Mrs. Hoel­
linger, and which are included among
the voluminous exhibits. "Nobody's
missing the fun of kissing—Every­
body's doing it," reads one tender
missive. "Mince de deception, tout
est faux," reads another. "When I
get you alone tonight," suggests a
third, and "U-needn't ask, take it,"
declares a fourth. "I love my hus­
band, but O you kid," reads another."
Jhe postal card messages were dat­
ed at various points in the United
States, and one letter carte from
Hong Kong, China. Checking ac­
counts, dry giods bills, and an enorm­
ous barreled beer account are also
submitted. One interesting fact shown
is that Mrs. Hoellmger once bought
a $12.no kimoha.
Long Married.
The Hoellingers were married at
Superior/Wis., in 18S9. Practically
all of their property, evidence shows,
has been accumulated in Ward coun­
ty, since their marriage. The defend­
ant is now "worth" about $70,000, and
the plaintiff has .been awarded a big
slice of his property on the grounds
that she helped him make it. Pend­
ing the final decision of the case, the
Hoellingers are residing under the
same roof, in the Windsor hotel, at
Minot, and Mrs. Hoellinger is drawing
$100 (he month temporary alimony.
Each accuses the other of infidel­
ity, of a too great love for the cup
that cheers, ol' too great fondness for
the company of the other sex, of ex­
treme cruelty, abuse and slander.

TWO PHYSICIANS TESTIFY.
(Special to the Tribune.)
Jamestown, N. D., Dec. 4.—Tes­
timony by 'Drs. A. W. Guest and
W. W. Wood, who performed the
operation in an attempt to reduce
hernia, which was indirectly the
cause fthe death of Andrew
8onnek, constituted this morn­
ing's development in the trial of
Albert Mammego, charged with
murder in the first degree of his
neighbor, near Eldridge, on Sept.
12, 1916.
Dr. Guest testified that Sonnek
died from shock, caused by an in­
jury, giving a detailed account of
the operation attempted in order
to save the latter's life. Or. Wood
testified to the statement that
the only chance to save Soniic^k's
life was by an operation.
Attorney Freerki, for the de­
fense is attempting to show that
the operation was the 'greiter
shock to the man and may have
hastened his death.
Jamestown, N. D„ Dec. 4.—The case
of the State versus Albert Mammen
ga on a charge of murder has opened,
and several important eye witnesses
to the unfortunate happening which
resulted in the death of Andrew Son­
nek, near Eldridge, have testified.
Members of the Jury.
A jury was secured late Saturday
afternoon. The following jurors will
sit on the case: C. C. Broderson, Pin
gree Byron Brooks. Cleveland James
Norris, Jamestown Fred Wilhelm,
Jamestown Alix Anderson, Streeter
M. W. French, Goodwin A. A. Ham
mersteadt, Kensal William Carey,
Medina A. C. Y. Sund, Cleveland C.
T. Xuss, Jamestown C. J. Benson,
Montpelier and Gottlieb Witt.
Neighbor Farmer Testifies.
William S. Baldwin, a neighbor of
both the defendant and the victim,
Sonnek, pictured vividly the circum­
stances leading to the death of Son­
nek.
On the morning of Septejnber 12,
1916, the witness was working with a
crew of men threshing grain on the
Mamenga farm near Eldridge. Both
Mamanga and Sonnek were numbered
jn the crew. The first intimation Mr.
Baldwin had that trouble was brewing
Was when he noticed Mammenga ap­
proaching Sonnek at a rapid pace.
Words were exchanged, followed by
blows. The two men rolled to the
ground and it was at this juncture
that Sonnek received the blow in the
abdomen that later resutled in his
death.
The trial is progressing rapidly and
is one of the most interesting held in
Stutsman county since the Miller mur­
der cae.
Contention, of Defense.
The contention of attorneys Freerks
and Carr of the defense is that while
kneeling on the right knee a man can­
not deliver a blow of sufficient force
with his left knee to injure a man to
any great extent.

"We have not been served with the

do not expect that any bluff of that

tice-eiect James E. Robinson in Secre­
tary of State Tom Hall's office this
morning.
And just at that moment Sheriff J.
P. French stepped in, served the or­
ders, and stepped out again.
Justice-elect Robinson grinned as he
accepted service.
Files Oath of Office.
Justices-elect Robinson and R. H.
Grace arrived on No. 1 last night.
They took the first car to the capitol
this morning, and at 9 o'clock they
filed their oaths of office in the secre­
tary of state's office. Birdzell did not
appear in person, but sent his oath
through Robinson.
Robinson Interviewed.
Interviewed in the' secretary of
state's private office a few minutes lat­
er, Justice-elect Robinson Baid:
"We have all qualified, and we ex­
pect that the retiring justices will'give
us our office tomorrow, when we pre­
sent certificates of election duly sub­
scribed by the state canvassing board.
No, we have not been served with the
order of the provisional court, and we
do not expect that any bluff of tb£t
kind will be pulled upon us. Mr. Bird
zell will be here Tuesday to take his
seat with us
No Court Has Jurisdiction.
"No court has any jurisdiction in
this matter above that vested by the
constitution. We are proceeding un­
der the constitution, and we expect
the judges to have enough good sense
and dignity not to attempt to overrule
the constitution."
Grace Has Objection.
At this point, Grace interrupted
with a suggestion that the proper time
for giving out interviews as to the ex­
pectations of the justices-elect had
not arrived.
Will Not Discuss Injunction.
Grace 'was particularly insistent
that there be no discussion of the pos­
sibility of the state auditor's being en­
joined against paying December sal­
aries to the retiring justces. The
Courier-News yesterday, after an in­
terview with Dobinson, suggested that
this "would be done. Robinson, evi­
dently, was willing to say more this
morning, but after Grace's caution he
withdrew into himself.
Nothing Doing Until Tuesday.
While Grace later admitted that
something might break today, Robin­
son seemed very confident early this
niching that there would be nothing
doing until tomorrow, when the jus­
tices-elect may descend upon the su­
preme court, properly armed with cer­
tificates of election. Both Robinson
and Grace are making arrangements
for residence in Bismarck from this
date on, and it is understood they ex­
pect to be on the job every day after
Tuesday. Hirdzell will come in tomor­
row to qualify, but will return to
Grand Forks to complete his service
with the university, which will not ex­
pire until January 1..,
