CONVICTION
F SHANNON
REVERSED
By a decision of the state criminal
court of appeals, handed down last
week, the verdict of the district court
of Grady county In the case of Z. W.
Shannon, who was convicted of em
bezzlement in January, 1913, was re
versed and the cause was remanded
to the lower court with Instructions
to dismiss.
Mr. Shannon, it will be recalled,
was the secretary and treasurer of
the Southwestern Wholesale Grocery
company which went out of business
and it was alleged that he embezzled
the company's funds. Following his
conviction he was sentenced to one
year and one day in the state prison.
He has been out under bond pending
his appeal. In reviewing the case the
court reached tho conclusion that tho
object of the prosecution was the col
lection of a $1200 note due the com
pany from the defendant and hence
there were no grounds for criminal
action.
A copy of the court's decision has
been recei- ed by F. L. Riddle, one of
Shannon's at'orneys.

East and West Array:;! Against Eacli
Oilier on Question of Fitzgerald's
Food Embargo Threat
TAMMANY FACTION IS
WATCHED ON EVERY SIDE
Holding Balance of Power in House Posi
tion of Big Ring Congressman on
Issues is Significant
By United Press.
Washington, Dec. 4. Representa
tive Fitzgerald and his threatened
food embargo legislation wa;i the cen
ter of interest when the G 1th congress
convened for its dying session at noon
today.
Fitzgerald's declaration late in No
vember that he would Introduce a
resolution for a food embargo to keep
production in the United States and
reduce tho cost of living stirred up a
political hornet's nest.
Aside from the possibility of the em
bargo itself, Fitzgerald's action, if be
takes it. may portend a fight between
supporters of President Wilson, who
is against an embargo, and the Tam
many delegation, whose leader Is Fitz
gerald. Both members and gallery In tho
house watched with ' interest for any
Indication of the uttitode of the Tam
many delegation toward the Demo
cratic machine. Any movo by the
Taromanyites would be the more sig
nificant because they hold tho bal
ance of power in the house.
Representatives from west ai'd mid
dle west farm districts were absolute
ly alert for any factional split on the
threatened embargo resolution. They
are opposed to it and have threatened
that if it is introduced they will com
bat it with a retaliatory measure call
ing for an embargo on manufactured
articles such as constitute the bulk of
the exportations to Europe from the
eastern manufacturing states.
Packed galleries greeted the gavels
of Speaker Clark and Vice President
Marshall as chattering members of
both houses, in most cases meeting
for tho first time since the eventful
day in early September when they
rushed through the Adamson eight
hour law, turned to hear tho familiar
admonition to "he in order."
Little business was expected today.
Interest centered principally on the
floor of the house and senate cham
bers and in the galleries a mass ot
color, its membership made up of
members ot the white house family,
diplomats, families and friends of con
gressmen, aud the populace crowding
the public galleries, .
Senator Gallinger and Senator Keim,
Republican and Democratic floor lead
ers respectively, were named senate
members of the joint committee to no
tify President Wilson tha congress
was ready to hear him.
The house named as its members
Majority Leader Kitchin, Minority
Leader Mann and Representative Fitz
gerald, chairman of the appropria
tions committee.
Whenever It is, the house and sen
ate will arrange fo.' a joint session in
the big house chamber.
While little business Is in sight for
today on the floor of either house,
then- will be plenty r,T, routine busi
ness principally the submission of
the annual appropriation estimates ot
heads of the government departments.
These budgets, totaling millions, will
be the principal business during the
short session. Some resolutions were
to be introduced.
