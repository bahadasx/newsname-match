a restriction of shipments or iooastuffs
to Europe. Thousands of petitions
asking for an embargo have
been received by members of Congress
and at the White House. In every
case it is argued that the Increased
cost of living in the United States
demands a restriction of shipments
abroad. So far as has been disclosed
President Wilson and members of
the cabinet have no plans for acting
on the subject, but it is known that
various members of Congress intend
to push the subject and may develop
a fight. Chairman Fitzgerald of the
appropriations committee already has
announced his intention of introducing
a bill for a food embargo.
Women suffragists, renewing their
fight for passage of the Susan B. Anthony
amendment to the constitution,
have laid all the lines for their campaign,
and it is possible that their
demands may be crowded into the
short time Congress has to deal with
an Important budget of legislation.
Prohibitionists, no less ardent than
the suffragists, in their demand for a
federal amendment, are expected to
begin their fight anew.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 4?When
Congress reconvened Monday Presi- j
rlent Wilson had the assurance of
Speaker Clark and Representative <
Kitchin, majority leader, that, they j
would try to hasten enactment of.,
railroad legislation desired by the ad- !
ministration. Both expressed opin- (
ions In conference with the president ,
Sunday night that, measures to sup-I .
plement the Adamson law cotild be
passed in the short session, but they
asked the president's influence to (
eliminate the usual two weeks Chris- 1
mas-hoMday recess. Similar proinises
of co-operation on the railroad;^
acta will be sought by the president ;
this week from Senate leaders.
Many members of Congress Monday
appeared to favor some kind of J
! an embargo on food exports or other ,
action to reduce soaring prices. Rep- ,

New York, had announced his inten- J.

to work as Speaker Clark and Vice
President Marshall brought down the

the next House, on the basis of
the last election, would show at least
216 Democrats without Scully, of N'ew

conceded 213 to the Republicans.
These figures do not include the independent

WASHINGTON*. Dec. 4?Congress ;
reassembled today with three months
remaining in which to complete the
legis'ative plans of the first administration
of President Wilson.
With prospects of a much reduced
majority in the new House, or possibly
a line up so close that Democratic
control will be in doubt, administration
leaders have laid their plans to;
work at high speed in the hope of
enacting the most important part of i
their program before it is endangered

In accordance with the custom he!
set at the beginning of his term, j
President Wilson will read his adiress
from the clerk's desk in the hall

loinatie corps hear him from their j
places in the reserved galleries and
a embers of the cabinet, have specially

president's message is about 2,000 I

the railway situation.
Man's Monopoly Ends.
Today's opening marks the closing:
">f man's monopoly of membership in
the House of Representatives. In the
next Congress the clerks and the
pages and the speaker will be calling:
"The Lady from Montana."
Miss Jeanetto Rankin, Republican,
first woman elected to Congress, is
expected to be in her seat then. She
does not sit in the present session?
although many uninformed expected
to see her today?but comes In with
the new Congress. When she does
arrive the House will be confronted
with revising its rules to give her a
place on the floor.
in the Senate there were three new
members to take the oath of office,
James E. Watson, of Indiana, Republican,
takes the unexpired term of the
late Senator Shively, Democrat, who
was temporarily succeeded by Thomas
Taggart. Bert M. Fernald, Republi- i
can, of Maine, was elected to the va-j
cancy caused by the death of Senator ;
Burleigh. William F. Kirbv. Democrat,
of Arkansas, was elected to fill
the unexpired term of the late Senator
Clarke.
Fight Ln tlie Semite.
While the organization fight In the
House does not come until the assembling
of the next Congress, the
Senate probabliy will see some political
generalship in the selection of a
successor to Senator Clarke as president
pro tempore. Senators who have
their eyes on the majority floor leadership,
made vacant by the defeat of
Senator Kern, are loath to take the
office of pro tempore. Strangely
enough the disposition seems to be
to avoid an office Instead of seeking
it, because senators realize that the
man: who becomes president pro tempore
is out of the race for the floor
leadership. There have been, some i
indications that the situation might
lie solved by giving the office of president
pro tempore to Senator O'Gorinan,
who retires with the end or the
Congress. This, it is pointed out
would he a compliment to the retiring
senator, and would leave all the candidates
for the leadership free to enter
the contest. It is generally conceded
that while the Important appropriation
bills for the fiscal year
will occupy most of the time between
now and adjournment, much general
legislation on the adminstration program
would be urged. Committees
in ui ^uuaci v?vuuii |
the Webb bill to authorize domestic |
corporations to maintain collective
foreign agencies, the immigration
bill and a corrupt practices measure
to limit national campaign expenditures
are certain to be active from the
beginning.
Burglars Wh<

Bloodhounds Are Put on Their
Trail without Result at
Lost Creek.
Burglars broke into the Dost Creek
postoffice early Monday morning and
ransacked the place but all they got
for their trouble was about $1 in
small change. Tbere were but few
stamps on hand but neither these nor
the money orders were disturbed.
Sheriff Ross P. Stout's bloodhounds
were taken to the scene from this city
by Deputy Sheriff Laco Wolfe but the
dogs were unable to pick up a trail.
The burglars effected an entrance
by prying bars from a window and
smashing the window, after vainly
trying to pry open the front door with
a mattock. One of them cut his hand
severely at the broken window.
Nothing bur, the postoffice is situated
in the frame building where the
burglars entered. Miss Ida Garrison
is the postmistress.
