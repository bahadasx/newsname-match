General Carlos Or.una, who last night

Villa took with him from ?"hihuahua
City more than 100 young girls, all of
them weeping and many followed by
shrieking mothers, who were cast
asid- by the Villistas. Ahead of the !
troops went great trains of loot.
Juarez officials announced to-night ?
that Chihuahua City had been re- !
raptured and the VlUistBS driven
from the city in disorder. From Cen?

London. Per. H The Rumanian situa?
tion shows no signs of improvement.
The Teutonic troops have crossed the
lower Anresu River, and Hucharest is
now within easy range of their heaviest

across the Niaslov from the capital to

And tho slow-ins; down of the Russian
offensives m the Carpathians and in
the Pobrudja indicates, that the Ger
nianic forces have checked these move
men's, which threatened to upset all
their plans. The day's operations netted
the Teuton?: 2,1? prisoners.
Although the armies of Mackensen
and Falkenhayn drew the net closer
around Hucharest to-day on two of the
?ides where the greatest battle of the
rnmpaign is raging, the day was not en?
tirely lo?* to the defenders. South of the
city, with the assistance of Russian

i
Small War Council Predicted to Share Pre?
mier's Power?War Minister Threatens
Whirlwind Appeal to Nation
By ARTHUR S. DRAPER
London. Dec. 4 (Monday).?David Lloyd George brought.
Britain's Cabinet crisis to a head yesterday by formally notify?
ing Premier Asquith that he would resign as Secretary of War
unless his demands for Cabinet reorganization and for mor1
?energetic prosecution of the war were met.
Several hours after this sudden turn in affairs it was an?
nounced, at 11 o'clock last night, that the Premier had decided
to advise the King to consent to the reconstruction of the Cabi
! net. The King's assent is a mere matter of form.
This, it was emphasized, was to bring about the mo?!
\ effective prosecution of the war. The statement reads?:
"The Prime Minister, with a view to the most effsjctiv.?
prosecution of the war, ha< decided to advise His Majesty the
King to consent to the reconstruction of the government."
What the changes in the coalition Cabinet will be is a mat?
ter of conjecture. It is still possible that both Lloyd Ceorge.
and Premier Asquith will retain their o2ces after the most
critical upheaval in British politics since the beginning of the
war.

LIKING FOR ALLIES

LIBERTY ADDRESS
Diplomats Declare ft Frank
Expression Against
Prussianism
In? Tribuna flu reau I
Washington, Pec. ? Diplomatic cir
j cles were stirred by Presiiient Wilson's
i "liberty-' address in Wow York last
night, which is regarded as an open ex
iri of personal sympathy for
' France and Knglnnd against Prussian
| i.utoerary.' The diplomats are particu- I
| larly interested in his declaration that
. "peace is going to come to the world
only with liberty." and that "peace can
j not com?' so long as the destinies of
men are determined by small groups
i who o- . choices of their own."
The-e itetements aro taken as ex-,
pressing President Wilson's belief that '
: "Prussianism" must be replaced by pop- !
ular control in Germany before a last- I
lag ne.s re cari be made. With them, it j
is thought, he did much to dispel the i
rumors that, he would move soon for
peace.
Although Teutonic officials declared
that they ?aw in the speech only vague
. generalities, theJ were obviously a lit
' tie puzzled.
"As for Mr. Wilson's sympathetic
words ebout France," one Teutonic dip?
lomat said, "it is no more than might

The German people have only the

physicians said tha* if he passed the

i The Premier, by announcing his
determination to hring about "the
most effective prosecution of the
war," has made a big concession to
Lloyd (?coraje, and perhaps saved
his own office.
>tay Be \o Resignation
There is nothing suggesting that
Mr. Asquith contemplates abandon?
ing the Premiership, or, indeed, that
any resignations are impending, and
for the moment the only important
difference in the personnel of the
ministry seems to be the probable
readmission of Sir Edward Carson.
Lloyd George, who evidently in the
moving spirit in the whole crisis, has
not, it is now definitely stated, of?
fered his resignation to Premier As?
quith, hut he has threatened to re?
sign in certain contingencies.
The political observers concur that
the crisis will resuit in the constitu?
tion of a small war council, of four
or five members, exclusive of naval
and military advisers, for a more
vigorous prosecution of the war.
Their information, however, regard
ing the personnel of this council dif
fers considerably regarding ceruiin
prospective members, especially with
reference to Mr. A ?.(tilth's, inclusion
therein.
Lloyd George to Control
"Ti-e Daily \ew?'s" parliamentary
correspondent, who is aimo?t invariably
well informed, ?ays that Lloyd Georg
bad a two hours' talk with the Prime
Minister on Sunday, as a result <>r
which it was agreed that both "
Asqaith und Mr. Lloyd George would
remain in the government.
The correspondents understand tha'
Lloyd Georj*?? favoru a small war coun?
cil, which would not include .Mr
Asqaith, who, he think?, should de
\ote himself to the government of the
., apart from the war. Lloyd
**j??e's proponed role in th? new war
would, according to the .?ame
riir.'i ipoi 'I'-nt, not diff.r greatly from
the positioa Lord Ki'ohtner held m
the War unie... wh.-n . ?.? a mem?
ber of the late Liberal government,
that .- Aould to some extent
be independent of the government, lie
would have adviser*, but the power
of rnaair.g war decisions would be hie.
.\?<iuith Holds Conferences
?ignout Sunday there were manv
hurried consultations and meetings of
party loaders at the Premier'? resi?
dence. Premier Asquith will see tha
King this morning, and will ?ub
????lui-ntly make a statement in the
House of Commons in explanation of
the governmental crisis and th? steps
planned to meet it.
Lloyd George held a long consulta?
? th tr.e Premier in the afternoon,
and another with the Karl of Derby,
Cnder Secretary for War.
It was considertd lafBiftcBBt that S.r
Kd?vard < arson and A. Bonar LBV

It is generally believed now that the
