Proposal of Premier Asquith is Ac
cepted By the King
ACTION POSTPONED TO THURSDAY
Rumor Persists in London that War
Minister Lloyd George Has
Resigned.
London, Dec. 4. Premier Asquith
announced in the house of commons
today that the king had consented to
a reconstruction of the government
and asked that all questions relative
to the change be postponed until
Thursday.
London, Dec. 4. Premier Asquith
has decided to advise the king to
consent to the reconstruction of the
government. This was officially an
nounced last night. The statement
reads. "The prime minister, with a
view to the most effective prosecution
cf the war has decided to advise his
majesty the king to consent to the re
construction of the government."
It la reported that David Lloyd
George, minister of war, has resigned,
but as he did not call on the king yes
terday there is reason to doubt whet
her he has actually sent in his resig
nation. There can be little doubt that
the cabinet is in a precarious condi
tion and that some important changes
in its personnel will be announced by
the prime minister in the House of
Commons today. It Is not known what
Mr. Asquith will attempt to do in re
constructing the cabinet, but it has
been suggested that he will resign.
Mr. Lloyd-George is considered his
most likely successor in that event.
.The cabinet crisis has been precipi
tated by the collapse of the Rumanian
campaign and the critical situation in
Greece.;.:.'.',". '':'

Mrs. Wm. B. Edgerton.
The funeral of Mrs. 'William B. Ed
gerton was held at her late home Sat
urday afternoon at two o'clock. Rev.
Sidney R. I'erklns of the Congrega
tional church olficiating. There was
a large attendance and a great pro
fusion of beautiful flowers. The bur
ial was in the family plot at Dellwood
cemetery. Those from out cf town,
who attended the services, were Rob
ert K. Edgerton of Burlington, Miss
Mary Edgerton of Bennington, Mrs.
Delbert Edgerton of Arlington, Chas.

wood, Mrs. Burr Phillips of Dorset,
M. Spaulding of Poultney. Mr. and
Mrs. James Bebee and Mrs. Henry
Ix)veland of East Dorset.
Mrs. Edgerton was before mar
riage Grace Irene Kelley of Donby,
her parents being Mr. and Mrs. Henry
B. Kelley. She was born in Danby
April 10, 1805. She graduated from
the Castleton Normal school and en
gaged in teaching for several years.
Abou; twenty-five year ago she was
married to William H. Edgerton of
Danby alter which they came to Man
chester to reside. She became a
member of the Congregational church
and was an efficient worker in the so
cieties of the church.
During the last ten years she has
been a great sufferer but during her
long illness she maintained real in
terest in the affairs of life and was
patient and uncomplaining to the end.
A friend in speaking of her before her
death said, "I never come away from
her house feeling sad or cross or dull.
She seems to me the most perfectly
self-controlled person." Her life has
been an examplo to those who have
known her. Probably no one has
heard her express a word of bitter
ness. Her faith was firm and now ,
altho she has entered Into the rest
which remaineth for the people of
God. Her works do follow her. She
is survived by her husband, one son,
Robert K., whose headquarters are
in Burlington, and a brother Clarence
D. Kelley of Manchester.

"Tr BLOODY SHIRT."
Nothing of This Sort in Plain State
ment of Facts.
A leading democrat writes The Rut
land Herald asking if the voters of
Vermont are satisfied with the course
of Congressman Frank L. Greene dur
ing the last campaign, in trying to cre
ate sectional feeling, in other words,
"waving the bloody shirt?"
We have heard this talk of Con
gressman Greene and do most hearti
ly approve of it.
lie avoided in so far as possible and
stated absolute facts, facts that are a
matter of record, printed from day to
day in the Congressional Record, the
official record of the Senate and the
House of Representatives at Washing
ton. There was no "waving the bloody
shirt," in any of his speeches.
He told Just who controlled legisla
tion, quoting from the Record.
This proved beyond question that
the South had the control of practical
ly every important committee, and
the chairmanship of most of these
committees.
He showed how legislation favor
able to tlio South was passed while
legislation iavorable to New England
was turned down.
More than half the democratic rep
resentation in Congress is from the
South and he said it is just as natural
for the members from the South to
look after the Interests of their sec
tion first as it would be for those from
the North, were the latter in power,
instead tf the democratic party, con
trolled by the South.
By the irony of fate, when this dem
ocrat was. writing tliis letter, the com
mission of Thomas J. Goodwyn of
South Carolina was being signed mak
ing him National bank examiner for
the district of Vermont, to succeed
James H. Kelleher, deceased.
This is the first time in the history
of the state that a man from South
Carolina has bem appointed to an im
portant government office in Ver
mont. Were there no good faithful demo
crats who could fill the place?
Most certainly, a score of them.
But
Vermont can give the administra
tion no electoral or other votes.
South Carolina can.
New Hampshire can and did. If we
remember rightly the appointment of '
a life-long resident of New Hampshire.
U. S. marshal for Vermont did not
set very well with our democratic
brethren.
Neither will the appointement of a
South Carolina democrat to the best
office in Vermont, barring only the
collectorship, set well.
As Frank Greene might have said,
"neighbors, fi lends, democrats, if you
do not like it, vote the republican
ticket." Morrisville Messenger.

H&D BRONCHIAL ASTHMA
So Badly Man Could Not Lie Down
Cured by Vinol.
For years and years we have been
telling the people of Bennington that
Vlnol Is a wonderful remedy for bron
chial troubles. Here is positive proof:
Tllden, 111. "Fir live years I suf
fered from bronchial asthma. In the
winter time I was obliged to sit in
a Morris chair at night, as I could not
Ho down, owing to that dreadful chok
ing sensation. I tried nearly every
known remedy, but nothing gave me
any relief until one day I met the
Station Agent at Willlsvlllo, 111., and
he said he had been a sufferer for
years, but had been cured by Vinol. I
at once commenced to take it, and
the result is my cough Is gone, my ap
petite has improved, and 1 can lie
down and sleep all night, and my ex
perience leads me to believe that Vi
nol is a certain remedy for bronchial
asthma." John II. Condell, Tilden,
111.
The reason that cough syrups fail
in such cases is because they are
paliatlve only, while Vinol removes
tho cause, being a constitutional rem
edy lu which are combined beef and
cod liver peptones, iron and man
ganese peptonates and glycerophos
phates. It strengthens ami revitalizes
the entire system and assists nature
to expel the disease. W. L. Gokay,

SUNDAYBEG1NS HIS
BATTLE AGAINST
80 BOOZE
Says $100,000 Campaign is Be
ing Organized Against Him
NEARLY 50,000 AT 3 MEETINGS
More Than Twenty Men Overcome by
Their Emotions and Carried from
Tabernacle Unconscious.
Boston, Dec. 3. Billy Sunday doliv
livcred a vigorous attack on the liquor
interests of Boston at tonight's meet
ing in the immens tabernacle, saying
that .although they were organizing a
$100,000 campaign against . him, he
would ask no quarter in the fight. In
cmsed by the distribution of pamph
lets against him at a meeting in tho
tabernuclo last week and by the ap
pearance of publications, prepared, ac
cording to Mr: Sunday, with the sole
purpose of attacking him. the base
ball evengelist threw down the gaunt
let to the liquor interests, declaring
the fight is on.
Three meetings were held in the
tabernacle today, with a total atten
dance of more than 44.000 for the day.
The meetings this afternoon and even
ing were for men only and the athletic
revivalist talked In plain terms of the
evils ol the time. He held his hearers
as if by magic. More than 20 men
were overcome with emotion at the
afternoon and evening meetings and
had to be carried out in a state of un
consciousness. Just 27S0 trail hitters were regis
tered as a result of the day's work.
"Lack of Vision" was the subject of
the morning service, when the re
vivalist urged his audience to look
ahead and prepare for the herealter. I
For the afternoon and evening meet-i
iugs tho subject was one of his best- ,
known sermons. Hot cakes off the
griddle." ' n
Mr. Sunday in his sermon tonight
told of his conversion 28 years ago
In Chicago. The evangelist told how
he was one of a party of baseball
players who started out one Sunday
afternoon to "get tanked up." A com
pany of men and women playing on
instruments and singing gospel hymns
attracted the party. Although laughed
at and mocked at by his comrades, he
followed the singers to their quarters
where he promised to start life over
again. He told of the different star
baseball men of his time who went
to paupers' graves because of liquor.
With unusual vigor ho pointed out
thei sure results of sin and pictured
the horrible evils of Intemperance. He
spoko from the texts. "Rejoice, O
young man, in thy youth and let thy
heart cheer thee in the days of thy
vnnth nrtii u-nlk in thn u-uv nf tMiip
heart, and In the sight of thine eyes;
but know thou, that for all these
things God will bring thee into judg- j
ment," and "Be not deceived; God is
not mocked ;tor whatever a man sow-
eth that shall he also reap," and said
in part:
"In other words, do just as you
please; lie if you want to, steal if
you want to; God won't stop you; but
he will hold you responsible in the
end. Do just as you please until the
end comes, and then you are all in.
No one is living in ignorance of what
w ill become of him if he does not go
right nnd trot square. He knows there '
is a heaven for the saved aud a hell
for the damned, and that's all there is
to it.
"Many men start out on a life of
pleasures, l'lease remember two
things: First, pleasures soon have an
end, and, second, there is a day of
Judgment coming and you'll get
what's coming to you. God gives every
man a square deal. If sin weren't so
deceitful it would not be so attrac
tive. The effects get stronger while
you get weaker and weaker all the
time and there is less chance of break
ing away. j
"Many think a Christian has to be
a sort of dlshrag proposition, a wishy
washy, sissitied sort of a galoot and
lets every body made a. doormat of
him. Let me tell you the manliest man
is tho man who will acknowledge
Jesus Christ.
"You know there is a bunch of
mutts that sit around on stools and
whittle and spit and cuss and damn
and say that every man who has an
honest dollar ought to divide it with
them, while others get out and get
busy and work and sweat and toil ,
and prepare to leave something for
their wives and families when they
die, and spend tho rest for good."

AUSTRIA'S NEW EMPEROR
Favorite With Soldiers and a Man of
Modern Views.
Charles I of Austria, tho new ruler
of the dual empire, was born August
17, 1887, at the imperial chateau of
Ptrsenbeug overlooking the Danube
valley, says a dispatch from Vienna.
His childhood training was Intrust
ed to Archduchess Marie Thereso and
the Archduchess Maria Josefa, assist
ed by an English governess. He is
credited with having shown a consid
erable percocity in learning to read
and write and with having developed
a specialty in acquiring languages.
When he was 17 years of age the.
young prince joined tho 1st regiment
of uhlans as lieutenant and was later
transferred to tho 7th regiment of
dragoons. His military education
was interrupted in 1907 when he took
up tho study of law at the university
of Fragile. He was graduated the fol
lowing year and returned to his regi
ment, being promoted to captain on
November 1, 1910. Three weeks later
he was married to Frincess ZIta of
Parma, a member of the Italian Bour
bons. He remained with the army,
and in 1912 was promoter! to major
and two years later reached the rank
of lieutenant-colonel. The assassina
tion of his uncle. Archduke Francis
Ferdinand, at Sarajevo on June 23.
1914, made him the heir to the throne
and on July 23 of the same year he
was appointed colonel of the 1st hus
sar regiment.
The opening mouths of the Euro
pean war were spent by the heir ap
Iarent at the headquarters of the
Austrian commander-in-chief, Arch
duke Frederick. In January, 1915. he
went to the headquarters of the Ger
man emperor on a special mission,
and in July of this year was promoted
major-general and rear-admiral. Sub
sequently he spent considerable time
inspecting tho troops on the various
ironts by command of the Emperor,
Francis Joseph, and in .March, 1916.
was created field marshal and vice
admiral, receiving at the same time I
the command of an army corps on the
Italian front.
Tho emperor took part personally
in the great offensive against the
Italians In May of tho present year,
and his services were rewarded by the
German emperor by the iron cross of
the first class and the order pour le
merite. In July of tho present year
he was transferred to the command
of an army in East Galicla, consisting
of a composite force of Austro-Hun-garians,
Germans and Turks. In
October he took charge of Austria's
armies against Rumania.
Emperor Charles is reported to ho a
great favorite with tho soldiers and
to like to talk familiarly with the men
in the trenches. Me is tall and slender i
in build with a very round, ruddy face
and a hearty laugh. He is credited
with being a man of modern views
and nightly progressive tendencies,
and it Is believed that under his ad
ministration the Austro-Hungarian
governmental system will undergo
many changes.

Program by Local Orchestra and
North Adams Vocalists.
Bennington Elks Sunday afternoon
carried out the impressive memorial
exercises of the order in the presence
of an audience of between 500 and 600
people at the Harte Theatre. Just be
fore tho hour for the opening of tfia
program the members of the local
lodge inarched from their quarters in
tho Ritchie block to the theatre and
occupied seats in the center.
The service, always impressive, was
made even more beautiful through
the appropriate selection and rendi
tion of the musical program which
was provided by an orchestra under
the direction of George E. Donnelly
and by Mrs. It. K. Harding, soprano
and Mrs. F. A. Bagnall, contralto, of
North Adams. Duane Bassett acted
as accompanist for the vocalists. Mrs.
Harding and Mrs. Bagnall are the pos
sessors of pleasing voices that show
evidence of thorough training. The
Ierfect harmony and expression of
their selections made a deep impres
sion upon their audience.
Thomas E. Fitzgerald presided and
the program of the exercises was as
follows:

The address of John E. Sullivan of
Worcester, Mass., was a scholarly pro
duction and tho speaker closely held
his audience up to the final word. Mr.
Sullivan, who is a Worcester attor
noy, is an orator of exceptional ability
and for years has been much in de
mand on similiar occasions. The eulo
gy was undoubtedly a condensation of
tho host out of many orations. It was
roploto with references out of stand
ard literature and the thenio was
treated in a beautiful manner. Mr.
Sullivan is a man past middle life and
jKM'haps tho fact that his delivery
lacked some of thp characteristics of
younger speakers made his address all
tho moro pleasing.
