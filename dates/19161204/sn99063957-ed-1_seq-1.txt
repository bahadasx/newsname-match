Washington, Dee. A. Congress con
vened nt noon today for a hunl three
months grind.
It faced President Wilson's mandate
for completion of unfinished railroad
legislation, it had budgets of millions
upon millions for government expenses;
and it planned a tight around food

knowing there is n lot of it ahead.

Socialist Members Would
Have Food Dictatorship
- with Embargo
Washington, Dec. 4. Legislative pro
posals intended to shatter the high cost
of living marked the reopening of con
gress today.
Keprescntative Fitzgerald, leader oT
the embargo forces, introduced four
plans two of them calling for food ex
port erabnrgoes, the other two for regu
lation of cold storage and for reduction
of parcel post charges on food.
Keprescntative Farr, of Pennsylvaaia,
proposed an embargo on wheat and Rep
resentative London, of New York, so
cialist, worked on measures proposing a
firtual food-dictatorship, with an inci
dental food expert ban.
Congressmen from industrial centers
favored the price-coatrol plan. Repre
sentatives of the farming districts wail
ed against the bills and threatened mu
nitions embargos if they are molested iu
their prosperity.
Senate Gets Busy.
Senator Alanine, of New Jersey, is
another who will fight in the upper
house for a food embargo on all staple
articles. Ho announced he will intro
duce his resolution later this week.
Further action in the senate was
promised by Senator Lewis, of Illinois,
tie said he would introduce a bill to
provide that the government be empow
ered to seize-foodstuffs on which a com
er is attempted, condemn them and then
re-seil to the public.
Both houses passed resolutions to no
tify President Wilson that they are sit
ting and ready for lira message tomor
row. The house convened nt 12:01 when
Speaker Clark pounded fur order, nnd
tho senate got down to business three
minutes luter. At 12:11 the senate re
cessed until 3 o'clock, meantime ap
pointing a committee to notify the
house it was ready for business.
Crammed galleries "watched the pro
ceedings. In the house "Speaker Clark
was cheered roundly. After the mob
like chatter of the welcome home squads
hnd been quelled, the chaplain prayed
for "uenco within our borders" while
representatives stood in their places.
Fitzgerald's Bill.
In introducing his bill Fitzgerald
suid:
"The multiplying evidences of the
widespread interest in the high cost of
living, makes me hopeful of success.
The enactment of either of the embar
go bills and tho bill to regulate colJ
storage and parcel post will bring im
medinte relief to tho country.
"The peoplo want action; they are
heartily tired of talk and investiga
tion." His bills in brief are: -
No. 1 Provision fur nn out and out
export embargo of farm products and
niaiiiifiictureil-foodstiiffs for one year.
No. 2 Provision for the president to
suspend exportation whenever prices be
come cxtortbninte and the public iuter-
est requires such action.
No. :i Regulation of cold, storage y

Gets After Speculators.
The first step from the farm pronp
came when Representative l.iiidberg.
Minnesota, introduced a resolution, at
tacking "parasite speculators" and
proposing nn all jjjud embargo bill tu
be considered by a joint senate ami
house committee. His bill, if success
ful, would tend tonidetrack the subject.
He held that embargoes would be an un

(United Tress stuff correspondent)
Kl Paso, Texas, Dec. 4. After sys
tematically looting and evacuating
Chihuahwa City, Villa is today 'march
ing westward toward the mountains of
western Chihunhua, carrying four train
loads ol loot and supplies. At 7 o'clock
(Saturday night Mexican government
troops re-occupied tho northern capital
without bloodshed.
In tie first messages exchanged af
ter the wires were reopeued between
Chihuahua and tho border, nothing was
said of the fute of the six Americans
who were known to have been in Chi
huahua City when it was attacked and
captured by Villistas a week ago. Rel
atives of the missing men nnd United
States department agents here at once
dispatched telegruuis to the American
residents of t hihuuhnu City, but early
today no replies to these messages had
reached the border.
In Juarez today troop trains with
fresh supplies of ammunition were pre
paring to start nouth. Unofficial ad
vices stated that the relief columns of
ilieneral Murgia and the remnants of
i General Treviuo's ceuiuiniid had inarch
ed into Chihuahua City from the south
and that the new artillery brought up
by Murgia is being outplaced on fue
dominating hills of iSantn Hoja. Every
preparation is being made to garrison
the city more heavily than heretofore.
A concervative estimate by Carranza
military authorities place the number
or government troops now iu the north
ern capital at 8,000.
From unofficial gpnrces it was learn
ed that the loot gathered by the Vil
listas was enormous. Tho bandits car
ried everything of value in wngons to
trains nt the Mexican .Northwestern
station. Automobiles we're commandeer
ed to haul Villista officers about the
streets while the sacking of the city
was in progress. More than two hun
dred thousand dollars worth of coin and
bullion was part of the booty taken by
tho bandits, one account s ates. So
great was the, terror ol' the natives
that some even helped the bandits to
loot their own homes und helped carry
away the loot. From Tuesday until
Saturday the roboery went on. j
Hvc modern guns of 73 nnd HO mil
limeter caliber were pulled down from
Santa Rosa hill by Villistas and taken
nlong, while the remaining three were
disabled. Mining men here declare they
have information Hint Villa captured
seven thousand rilies, sixty machine
guns and quantities of ammunition.

Supreme Court Holds It Law
; ful to Make Discrimir.a
( tory Rates
Washington, Dec. 4 The supreme
court today held the interstate com
merce commision had the right to per
mit railroads to charge less on freight
to tho Pacific coast than they charge
inland cities along the const. This dis
poses of the famous Pacific Terminals
case.
San Francisco, Dec. 4. Officers of
the chamber of commerce traffic bu
reau, which has been fighting for some
time to keep freight rates to terminal
points lower than tho rate to inland
cities, declared today thnt tho Wash
ington decision means that the battle
is won.
For several years inland cities on the
coast, have mado against "back haul"
charges, while coast cities have held
that a lower rate to them was neces
sar in ordor to permit them to meet
waacr competition. If tho rato to sea
port cities should bo raised it would
mean that tho railroads could not com
pel o with stenmship lines nnd mer
chants would spend thousands more
than before, it was held.
Interior cities have protested against
paying a rate to terminal points and
then a second charge for "back haul."

RUSSIANS CLAIM TO
HAVE CHECKED ADVANCE
Germans .Claim Rumanians
Demoralized by Many ,
Defeats
By Carl W. Ackerman.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Headquarters of Field Marshal Voa
Mackcnsen, 50 kilometers ttom Buch
arest, Dec. 1. (Vio Berlin and Say villa
wireless, Dec. 4.) German troops today
were within 10 miles of Bucharest. Th
Rumanian retreat is so precipitate that
German advance columns ou Thursday
and Friday, hotly pursuing them, lost
touch with the German imantry, buck
ing them up. The slower moving in
fantry was unable to keep up wita th
advance column in pursuit.
utticers all declare ths moral of tho,
Rumanians is completely broken. It ir
not expected they will be able seriously
to defend their capital.
Field Marshal V on Sluckcnscn. and
General Von Falkenhayn, however, aro
tailing no rnances. r.very road leading
toward Bucharest from the south, the,
nest and the north is packed with Ger
man, Austrian, Hungarian and Turkish
troops, carrying all equipment necessary
lor a wego oi tne city.
Tho above dispatch was (fated Frid"
and puts the German forces encircling
Buchurest closer to their mark on Fri
day tbau had been oven hinted at ia tk
official statements.
Ackerman 's dispatch was written De
cember 1. Since that time Russian of
ficial statement's have detailed a stren
uous effort by Russian forces to stent
the tide of this advance. The point of
greatest menace to Bucharest was to th
south and this is probably the section.
wnere ACKcrman's uispateh puts th
German forces withlu 10 miles of th
capital.
Ihe Russian stateaient of last night
claimed retirement of the Gcrmau-bul-gnriau
forces iu this section after do-
teat aud capture by the allied forces of
prisoners and booty, including at least
20 guns.
In the light of Ackerman 's dispatch,
indicating that the German udvancad
kirmishers were pursuing tne Ruman
ians so hotly t hut they had lost con
tact with the infantry forces hacking
them up, tu Russian victory become
more apparent.
Presumably it was this advnnea
skirmish guard upon which Russian aad
Rumanian troops inflicted defeat, prob
ably because of tho very fact that thejr
lacked infantry backing.
