Railroad and Food Legislation
to Take Up Time in Session
Opening Monday.
WILSON AND LEADERS CONFER
Clark and Mann Assure Presi
dent of Co-operation; Full
Attendance Indicated.
WASHINGTON, Pec. 3. Speaker
Clark and Kepresentativo Kitcliin,
majority leader of the house, assured i
President Wilson at a White Mouse
conference tonight that they would
do all they could to hasten the pass
age of railroad legislation at the short
session of congress, which begins to
morrow. The president summoned the house
leaders to talk over with them the
legislative program and to secure the
co-operation ill expediting Important
measures.
Legislation to supplement the
Adamson law, he said, was of the
utmost Importance, and he asked that
this be given precedence In consider
ation over ull other general legisla
tion. Itcallzlng that three months Is a
short period for Consideration of gen
eral measures when appropriation
bills also must be passed, the presi
dent asked the house lenders if they
thot there would be time for ennet
ment of new- railroad laws before
March 4. P.oth told him they thot
there would be and promised to exeit
every effort to economize time on
other matter..
Chirk Vrgos "Illsino.s.',
Speaker Clark reminded the presi
dent that congress would have to
pay strict attention to business and
asked him to help nt the outset to
eliminate the usual two weeks holi
day recess.
President Wilson did not discuss de
tails of the railroad legislative pro
gram with the house leaders. He
spoke briefly regarding other Import
ant measures, among thehi the Webb
bill to permit domestic corporations
to maintain collective foreign selling
ngencles, tho corrupt political prac
ticed bill and conservation measures.
Proposed embargo legislation and Is
sues raised by tho high cost of living
wee not mentioned at the conference.
In the opinion of the house leaders,
however, the subject Is bound to de
mand attention of congress.
"There Is no question," said Rep
resentative Kltchin, "that various
measures aimed at high prices of
food will be pressed. Discussion of
that Issue Is bound to consume time,
but in spite of that I think that we
can find time for consideration of
railroad laws. Of course, I assume
to .-peak only for the house. I don't
know what the senate can do."
To Discuss 1 'roc ram.
Within a few days the president
proposes to talk with the senate lead
ers regarding the legislative program,
but the conference probably will not
be hold until after he has delivered
his address to congress on Tuesday.
Sens tor Kern, the majority leader,
has been .delayed in reaching Wash
ington owing to illness, but will ar
rive tomorrow In time for the open
ing of -the new session.
Scores of members of both houses
rear bed Washington torlay and to
night ami a full attendance of con
gress tomorrow Is assured. One of
the last to arrive- was Vice-President
Marshall, who was given nn enthusias
tice reception at the railroad station
this afternoon.
Wilson on Scene.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. Hack from
New York after Inaugurating the new
lighting system for the Statue of l.io
erty last night. President Wilson today
began work preparatory to the open
ing of congress tomorrow. With Mrs.
Wilton the president returned to
Washington at 7 : 3T o'clock this morn
ing". Tho president has made few gen
eral engagements for the week be
cause of his desire to devote himself
almost entirely to conferences with
congressional lenders In an effort to
get the legislative machinery started
promptly. He realizes there must be
speed in the handling of the appro
priation measures If the additional
program he will lay beforo congress
Tuesday Is to bo taken up.
Will Henialn in Washington.
F.xpoctlng to remain almost con
stantly In Washington, tho president
probably will accept few of the many
Invitations now before him to speak
In different places. No final plans
have been made for delivering a spe
cial message on the high cost of liv
ing to congress later In tho session,
but Mr. Wilson Is understood to fa
vor taking such a step when the op
portunity offers.
Tuesday Mr. Wilson will follow his
custom of going beforo congress per
sonally to rearl his annual message.
Wednesday ho will entertain William
J. p.ryan and Mrs. Ilryan at lunch In

Secretary's Resignation Not
Vet Acted Upon, hut No
Denial of It Is Made.
LONDON. Dec. ,1 1 1 : r.O p. m.)
Premier Asqulth has decided to urlviso
tho king to consent to tin- reconstruc
tion uf the government. This was of
ficially announced tonight.
The statement rends:
"The prime minister, with a view to
the most effective prosecution of the
war. has derided to advise his ma
jesty the king to consent to tho recou
slriiclloti of the government."
Crisis Heroines Acute.
The political crisis has becomo
acute. R Is staled In well informed
quarters that David Lloyd-George,
tin- war M'crotary, has tendered his
resignation which has not yet been
aooeplcil.
It wns understood no official an
nouncement would he made tonight,
but that Premier Asqulth will see tho
king again tomorrow morning nnl
thereafter make a statement In tho
house of commons In explanation of
the situation.
Thus far it appears no arrangement
has been made for Secretary Lloyd
Gr'orge to see tho king, which would
indicate that at the present moment
there Is some prospect that the crisis
will he sin in, muted without the com
plete collapse of tho coalition cabi
net nnd without tho resignation of
Mr. Lloyd-George.
Many Conferences Held.
Premier Asqulth loft town yester
day, hut returned this morning and
thruout the day there have been con
sultations anrl meetings of parly lead

Mr. Lloyrl-George had a long con
sultation with the premier this ufter
noon. other visitors wore A. Ilonar
Lbw, secretaries of the colonies, and
Marquis or Crewe, lord president ot
the council.
Perhaps the most significant Inci
dent was that. Sir F.dwurd Carson anil
Mr. Law appeared together and ad

The railroad brotln i hoods, accord
ing to present plans, will not be rep
resented in the formal proceedings to

ticipate In the arguments.
Altho motions to expedite cases aro
seldom acted upon by the court until
a week alter their presentation. It Is
considered not unlikely that Chief
Justice White will Immediately an
nounce a date for uigument in this in
stance. What tho date may be. how
ever. Is very uncertain, us tomorrow's
calendar of forty cases specially as
signed for argument is unusually long.
It Includes the congressional contempt
