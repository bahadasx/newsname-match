With Crowded Program of
Legislation Mapped Out
FLOOD OF BILLS IN
Leaders Concentrate on Pas
sage of Big Supply
Measures
Washington, D. C., Dec. 4. —Con-
gress assembled promptly at noon to
day for the short session which will
mark the closing of President Wilson's
first term.
With a crowded program of legis
lation, foremost in which is the Presi
dent's plan for railroad legislation,
senators and representatives settled
down to work a.s Speaker Clark and
Vice-President Marshall brought down
their gavels.
To-day's opening was marked by
the usual flood of bills and resolutions,
many of which are expected to die in
committee with the Congress itself on
March 4.
The energies of administration lead
ers were at once concentrated on the
passage of the big supply bills neces
sary for the conduct r>f the govern
ment and upon the limited program
of general legislation.
Democrats Control House
Speaker Clark declared the next
House, on the basis of the last elec
tion, would show at least 216 Demo
crats without Scully, of New Jersey,
and Beakes, of Michigan. He con
ceded 213 to the Republicans. These
figures do not include the Independent
group ot four, which, with two in
doubt, make a total of 435.

Postcard Mailed Here
44 Years on Way to
Wrightsville, York Co.
Tork, Pa., Dec. 4.—A postcard sent
by the Baltimore Coal Company from
its Harrisburg office on August 23,
1872, to the Wrightsville Iron Com
pany, was received by the local firm
yesterday. It took the card forty-four
years, three months and eight days to
travel from Harrisburg to Wrights
ville. The borough postmaster says
that he has received no explanation
of the long delay in the forwarding
of the card. The card bore a 3-cent
stamp.
Postmaster Frank C. Sites said this
morning that he believed someone
found the card after it had been mis
laid and probably as a joke mailed it
recently, as nothing was said of the
postmark date. He said that he was
sure the post office department was
not responsible for the delay, as the
card would have been discovered when
the local office was removed to tem
porary quarters.
Start Relabeling All
Storage Eggs in Effort
to Force Prices Down
Pittsburgh, Dec. 4.—The first defi
nite efTorts of the State Dairy and Food
Commissioner to adopt measures tend
ing to bring about a decrease in the
retail price of eggs in Allegheny county
began to-day when inspectors started
relabeling all eggs which have been in
storage longer than eight months, the
limit prescribed by law.
The inspection will be made under
Instructions of State Dairy and Food
Commissioner James Foust, of Harris
burg.
The majority of eggs now in storage
are said to be April and May eggs.
The forcing of these eggs out of stor
age through desire of storage men to
get rid of them before the prescribed
eight months expire will bring a de
crease in prices, Commissioner Foust
believes.
Central Iron Not For

Reports that the Bethlehem Steel
Company is negotiating for the
purchase of the Central Iron and
Steel Company's plant were denied
to-day. General Superintendent
Robert H. Irons, of the Central
Iron and Steel Company, said:
"There Is absolutely no truth in
the report. This plant is not for
sale."

Penna. Laws Prescribing
Butter Fat Standards
Upheld; Will Push Suits
I Washington, Dec. 4. lowa and
Pennsylvania laws prescribing butter
. fat standards for ice cream were up
! held as constitutional to-day by the
1 Supreme Court in test cases attack
; ing their validity as arbitrary exercise
of State'"police powers," although de
signed to prevent adulteration of food
! products.
The decisions, the court was advised
;by the Xational Association of Ice
j Cream Manufacturers, would affect
the entire ice cream industry and leg
islation of many States, of which more
than thirty have similar statutes.
The decision of the United States
Supreme Court upholding the consti
tutionality of the Pennsylvania ice
cream act establishing standards of
fats for the product will affect hun
dreds of cases in this State. The test
case was brought in Erie county and
was appealed by a Buffalo firm. The
State Superior and Supreme Courts
upheld the act.
The dairy and food division will
now proceed with prosecutions which
have been brought in about a dozen
counties.
Say Woman Dressed as
Man to Aid in Thefts;
Y. M. C. A., Headquarters
That Mrs, May Hirnisey, masquer
ading as a man, aided Lou Faust, in
his series of robberies in other cities,
is the clue which city police and de
tectives are working on as they are
! compiling their mass of evidence
against Faust, now charged with com
mitting scores of robberies in all parts
of the State.
Police claim too, that Faust, by
using a Y. M. C. A. card issued at
Sunbury, secured rooms at other as
sociation buildings and after collect
ing a large amount of loot, would take
it to his rooms and pack it for ship
ment to Mrs. Hirnisey.
Two Sunbury men and a projninent
citizen of Heading were among the
latest visitors at police headquarters
last evening and this morning to
identify some bf their property.
Harrisburg Hospital Isn't
Affected by State Report
"So far as I know the Harrisburg
hospital will not be affected in any
way by the report of the State Board
of Charities, as I believe we are com
plying and have been complying with
all that it requires of us," declared
John Fox Weiss, secretary of the
I board of hospital managers to-day.
"It is true, perhaps, that our build
ings are not as modern as they might
be, but so far as equipment and con
duct of the institution are concerned
I don't really Fee how the board's re
port could affect us. We have done
what we have been advised by the
| State board to do—for instance, the
removal of the nurses' dormitory on
the fourth floor, and we have made
proper arrangements for caring for
maternity cases. Whether it will be
necessary for the board of managers
to take any action in any way on the
State board report I do not know, as it
hasn't come to us officially as yet."
Insane Asylum Inmate
Is Slain by Another
Attacked and severely beaten by a
fellow Inmate of the violent ward of
the State Lunatic Hospital, William O.
Shue, 50 years old, died from his in
juries.
An attendant, J. S. Collins saw
Frank McCann and Shue quarreling,
in what seemed to be a playful man
ner. When he noticed that the at
tack was an attempt to kill he en
deavored to separate them but Mc-
Cann had knocked Shue to the floor
and Jumped on his chest before they
were finally parted.
Contrary to the rules of the hos
pital, Collins did not report the oc
currence to a superior, supposing that
Shue's injuries were slight. Dr. J. R.
L. Rldgway. an attending physician
noticed the man's wounds were seri
ous while making his usual rounds.
Shue died within twenty-four hours.

"Tell your readers to shop early,

It required small effort on the part
of a reporter to find reasons for this

that good living is possible at a cost
less than 40 cents a day, efforts were

the end of the first week was 33 2-3
