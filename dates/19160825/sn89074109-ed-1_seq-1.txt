Only Seed Grain
in State is Here
Agricultural College Representa
tive Here Monday Says Golden.
Valley Has Only Seed Grain
In The State
A. B. Christenson of the North
Dakota Agricultural College at
Fargo, was in Sentinel Butte on
Monday of this week for the pur
pose of looking over the crops of
the Golden Valley as to the pros
pect of getting seed for next year,
and he gave it as his opinion that
the Golden Valley is practically
the only portion of the state that
will raise any appreciable amount
of wheal that will be fit for seed.
Mr. Christenson made trips both
north and south of Sentinel Butte
and while our crops are not up
to the normal by any means they
are so much better than the gen
eral run of small grains through
North and South Dakota and Min
nesota that he says we had ought
to save practically all of it for
seed and many farmers are plan
ning on doing this.
Every year the North Dakota
Agricultural College interests it
self in the matter of finding out
where the best seed can be ob
tained and keeps this informatiion
on file for inquiring farmers. As
a rule good seed can be obtained
almost anywhere in the state but
this year they will have to come
to the Golden Valley.—Sentinel

O'KEEFE SECURES
RECOMMENDATION
The unexpected vacancy occas
sioned by the resignation last
week of J. M. Baer from the local
postmastership, and which result
ed in a fiurry in democratic cir
cles, is relieved, it is thought by
many, in the recommendation by
Hie democratic county central
committee Wednesday of A. J.
O'Keefe. Several other aspirants
were feeling out their strength.
At the meeting Wednesday, how
ever, Mr. O'Keefe received seven
votes out of the twelve. If his
nomination is confirmed *.vhi!e
the senate still is in session, it is
probable that lie will receive his
appointment soon. If a recess is
taken before his nomination is
acted upon, on the other hand, it
may be thai the appointment will
be held up until the results of the
presidential election is known—
and in the case Hughes is elected
it is claimed that Mr. O'Keefe's
appointment will not be made at
all. However, this is largely a
matter of possibilities, and while
no accurate forecast can be made,
it seems that Mr. O'Keefe's early
nomination is reasonably prob
able. Our comments are largely
the speculations of Beach politi
cians of both parties.
fO. S. Hougen of Kildeer spent
several days this week with rela
tives here.
Natural Gas on
Farm Near Golva
Sinking of WL"ll Reveals Reser
voir of Unknown Capacity on
A. J. Nistler Farm—Invest
igation of Extent Being
Conducted
Considerable excitement over
the discovery of natural gas pre
vails at Golva, following the
drilling of the well on the A. G.
Nistler farm near that place last
Wednesday forenoon. With a roar
that was plainly heard for a con
siderable distance a large column
of mud shot nearly eighty feet in
the air as the drill pierced a rock
strata 200 feet belowr the surface
EITorts of two men to hold a
board over the top of the five
inch casing were unsuccessful, so
strong was the pressure.
A specimen of dark, heavy mud
ejected from the casing has been
sent to Prof. Ladd of the Agricul
tural College at Fargo for analy
sis. The constituents of natural
gas are hydrogen 3.0, methane,
92.0, ilUiminants, 3.0 and nitrogen
2.0, or varients. Should the find
have a marketable value, and in
vestigation show deposits of suf
ficient extent to make it profitable,
the find may prove valuable to
Mr. Nistler. Geological invesliga
tons seem to preclude the possi
blity of oil, the lower stralas not
being such as to indicate its pres
ence. However, it was not con
ceived that the Golden Valley was
the repository of gas, and the
present discovery may be but tltc
fore runner of valuable future
findings. In the meantime Prof.
Ladd's report is eagerly awaited.
Should the gas prove valueless
Mr. Nistler will continue drilling
his well in the hope that when he
penetrates to a further depth he
may come into possession of an
artesian flow.

Statement by
Supt. Lantry
:The following statement upon
the deadlock between the railway
employes and railway managers
clarifies the misunderstanding ot
many as to the purport of the 8
liour demand by the employees:
"In connection with the
eight hour day movement,
many think cutting of the train
and engine men's working day
to eight hours would mean cor
responding reduction in pay.
"This belief is erroneous.
The fact is that men demanding
the eight-hour day .expect to
receive the same pay they are
now getting for ten hours'
work. This would involve a
20 per cent, reduction in work
ing hours without any change
in sompensation."
NEW SCHOOL HEAD HERE
1 he election of a successor to
C. J. N, Nelson, who resigned two
months ago as superintendent of
Beach pity schools, and which
hung fire for several weeks, oc

school board, in the person of R.
M. Lewis, who is in the city and
has taken up the duties prepara
tory to the opening of school.
'•Superintendent J.ewis comes
here highly reccomended, and the
local board feels itself indeed for
tunate in securing him. He is a
graduate of Lawrence University
and the University of Wisconsin.
Contractor Chadderdon, who
has charge of the construction
work of the new J. P. Reeve block
which is nearing comple

Elliott Stands
By Arbitration
President of New Haven is of the
Opinion that Differences
Have Assumed Greater
Aspect than Formerly.
Fargo, Aug. 23.—Howard Elli
ott, president of the New Haven
railroad, bound from Bozeman,
Mont., lo Washington, to parti
cipate in llie railroad conference
with President Wilson, stands by
the principal of arbitration of the
present railroad difficulty.
Mr. Elliott expressed himself as
believing that the conference at
Washington had passed from the
plane of being simply at attempt
to settle a controversy over the
compensation, and now involved
the right of all American citixens
to have a dispute of this nature
settled on the basis of arbitration
—with .justice to all sides.
Mr. ElliolA was spending his
vacation at a ranch near Boze
man, Mont., of which he is part
owner. As president of the
New Ilavcn, taking the position
when that road was subjected to
most severe criticism because of
the series of disastrous wrecks
thai haul taken place. Mr. Elliott
has /accomplished wonders.
Holding firm to the belief that the
railroads should get closer to the
public that the railsoads should
lake the public into Iheir con
fidence, he has worked great
changes in sentiment of the peo
ple towardlhc railroads, and the
effect of his work is likely to be
come more important as the years
go by.
While he was president of the
Northern Pacific Mr. Elliott did
first v)rk :along\lhe (that
line. Subsequently, he has taken
the same tact in seeking to res
tore the confidence of Ihe public
in the New Haven lines, and his
administration of that system since
he took hold has been generally
acknowledged as remarkably suc
cessful, and a tremendous im
provement over conditions as
they formerly prevailed.

Incidentally he seized the oppor

proved a most interesting exper

here he paid this office a pleasant
call, and stated that he might

Removal Issue
to Get Place
No Court Order Yet Preventing
Publication of Capital
Amendmet
Bismarck, Aug. 28 The capi
tal removal issue will find a place
on the ballots that will be printed
shortly if Ihe supreme court fails
to make a decision on the contest
involving the proposed amend
mcnt prior to the time the ballots
are printed.
It was announced today from
Bismarck that a decision in the
New Rockford-Bismarck contro
versy regarding the legality of the
proceedings that have so far been
taken lo pi'ace the removal on the
ballot, will be forthcoming in a
short time.
Secretary of slate, Thos. Hall,
however, will print the proposed
amendment on the official ballots
as usual, unless a court decision
restrains him from so doing—
there being no temporary injunc
tion order.
Should a subsequent court dc
cison hold against New Rockford.
it would be necessary to print
new ballots, prevent the distribu
tion of ballots that have already
been 'prepared, or file an order
nullifying the effect of the vole.
A. B. Kellogg, now located at
Salt Lake City, in company with
his son-in-law, Louis Gilbertson,
arrived Thursday, and will spend
about six weeks in Beach looking
after business matters. Mr. Kel
logg has extensive interests here
and makes regular trips here to
attend to them. He reports him
self and wife in excellent health,
and that they have recently moved
from Calil'rnia to Salt Lake City,
where they are comfortably locat
ed. Mrs. Gilbertson is slaying

O. C. HOLTZ ORIGINATES
HANDY DOOR DISPLAY.,
O. C. Holtz, the enterprising
manager of the Thompson Yards,
Inc., is Ihe creator of ~.n ingenious
device which is causing much
comment among patrons of the
yard because of its simplicity,
saving of lloor space, aiul case
of demonstration of various mod
els of doors carried in stock. As.
the doors are offered for inspec
tion, a clever system of nail
hinges enable it lo be swung out
al any angle, resembling in action
the operation of turning the
leaves of a book. The device is
a greal saver of time and of floor
space, and Mr. Holt/, the origin
ator, stales that lie has used it
for a number of years.
A new, capacious but not bulky
filing cabinet is a recent acquisi
tion lo Mr. IIollz's private office,
and is invaluable in enabling him
to handle office details with ease
and dispatch.. While the Thomp
son office system is not necessari
ly a complicated one, it is thor
ough and efficient, and the new
equipment saves him much valu
able time.
And. too, we must not forget
to stale that in this issue of the
Chronicle the Thompson Yards,
Inc., who are firm believers in the
value of printers' ink in their ex
lensive publicity campaigns, have
an interesting talk which is of
more than ordinary interest to
the farmers of the Golden Val
ley al a time when Ihe rust dam
age has slashed the farmers*
profit in half. It deals with a
phase of farm activity to which
every farmer must ultimately
come—and is suggestively titled
The Dawn of a New Era." Ev-.
ery farmer should read it.
