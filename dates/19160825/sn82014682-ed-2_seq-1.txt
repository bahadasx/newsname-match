report now arrived it is hereby stated
that the submarine, on the evening of
August 19, at twilight, encountered a
British squadron composed of a bat

rounded by a large number of small
cruisers and destroyers.

The submarine at this action was

seen, while of a neighboring ship the
whole silhouette was visible.
"The commander of the submarine
received the impression that the tor
