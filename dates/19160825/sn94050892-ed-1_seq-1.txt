B'g Blast Fired
For ihe past week workmen have
been busy at point of rocks on the
road near the Barranca preparatory
to the big blast which removed the
wall on Monday morning. This point
of rock has been a danger and men
ace to 'ifij ever since the road along
the river was built and on account
of the looseness of the rock but very
little powder was needed for its re
movr.l. The ioad was blocked for
several hours by the mass of "art!i
and rock. In all 2000 yards and ap
proximately 8000 tons were removed.
The work is being done by the A. C.
company under the supervision of T.
L. Axton. The large rocks will be
used in the construction of a retain
ing wall at this point to protect (the
road from the high water and pre
venting a washiout.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROSS
VISITS CLIFTON
DISTRICT
Candidate for Nomination as Judge of
the State Supreme Court Meets the
Voters of the Clifton-Morenci Dist
rict Henry D. Ross, Chief Justice of the
Arizona Supreme Court. 'was spending
the first of the week in the Clifton
Morenci district where lift was setiye
ly engaged in meeting the voters of
this section. Mr. Ross is making a
campaign tour of the state in the in
terest of his candidacy for re-election
to the supreme bench nnd while here
he received a hearty reception from
all his old friends as well as making a
favorable impression on all with whom
he came in contact.
Judge Ross, who is a resident of
Prescott, is an old timer in northern
Arizona, having located in Flagstaff
over thirty years ago, and later going
to Prescott where he has made his
home and where he was one of the
leading attorneys. He was elected
district attorney of Yavapai county
and was later elected three different
times, and that he is an able and con
scientious jurist has been demon
strated by the unqualified endorse
ment of the voters at the various elec
tions. Judge Ross is now holding the short
term on the supreme bench, having
drawn the short term when three
democratic candidates were running
for thp office of justice of the supreme
court of Arizona. To show that the
people of the state are getting equal
representation from each section the
members o? the supreme bench are
now divided as follows: Chief Justice
Henry D. Ross comes from Prescott
in northern Arizona, Justice 'Alfred
Franklin from Phoenix in central Ari
zona and Justice D. L. Cunningham
from Tombstone in the southern sec
tion. The supreme bench as now consti
tuted is a body upon which no re
flections can be cast and their deci
sions have been rendered with fair
ness and impartiality, the letter of the
law being strictly adhered to at all
times, and at the head of this body is
Henry D. Ross, who is seeking the
democratic nomination for re-election
at the hands of the people this fall.
Judge Ross points to his record in
office with pride and relies upon the
sane and thoughtful judgment of the
voters as to his qualifications for a
continuance in office.
From Valley
B. A. Wilson, a prominent farmer
of the valley, was in Clifton this week
with a load of produce which he
readily disposed of. He paid the Era
a visit and left one of the largest and
most luscious watermelons that was
ever grown in the valley. Mr. Wil
son's fruit this year is of excellent
flavor and quality and he is finding a
ready market for it in this section.
He reports that the valley never
looked better and the crops have
been the best ever harvested.

To the Voters
Regardless of the efforts of
a set of would be labor political
bosses to induce me to quit the
race for supervisor, I wish to
announce to all my friends, and
particularly my friends who
carry a union card in their
pocket, that I am in the race to
the end and defy the poli
tical ring who set themselves
up against a union man for their
own political and financial profit.

PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO
OPEN SEPTEMBER
ELEVENTH
Board of Trustees Announce Opening
of Public Schools Monday, Septem
ber 11. Buildings Repaired, Com
petent Teachers Selected. Effi
ciency and Progress Mark Actions
of Board.
When the school bells ring Monday
morning, September 11th, another
year starts on its way and from the
extensive repair and improvement
I work which is now going on at the
different buildings some children are
1 going to be treated to a happy surprise
I when they enter the different schools
Ithe first morning.
I The high school building has been
j completely remodeled, and painted on
me ouisiae. ine nrsi noor nas Deen
divided into one large study hall, seat
ing 165 pupils, a library and office,
English room, and stenography and
commercial with glass partitions so
1 that one teacher can do all the work
if this department where two were re
quired under the old arrangement.
The upper floor .known as the auditor
ium, has been divided into three
rooms, a girls' lavatory and a corridor
for steel lockers for the girls. By
these changes much extra space has
been utilized and the girls' lavatory
taken from a dark, poorly ventilated
room in the basement to the second
floor, the commercial moved to the
first floor giving two large rooms for
recitation rooms. The chemistry and
physics taken from the first floor to
the second where the experimenting
does not disturb the rest of the stu
dent body. Cabinets for physics and
chemistry have been Installed, book
cases built into library, desks for
study hall, tablet arm chairs for reci
tation rooms, and wood turning and
pattern making machinery for the man
ual training department have been
added. -
The stones and earth from the up
per and back' sides of the lot of South
Clifton school building have been mov
ed to the lower side adding about
three lots to the present play ground
space and the whole yard . put into
first class condition. -
"The North Clifton floors and walls
which had dropped down about six in
ches have been raised by concrete
piers and iron and wood braces. The
walls have been plastered and painted
new blackboards and wood work built
in to take the place of those worn out,
new desks to replace the broken ones,
the roof patched, French windows in
stalled for exits to the fire escapes,
and the yard filled in. With these
improvements North Clifton now has
the best building in town.
The Chase Creek and Shannon
Hill school buildings have been paint
ed on the outside, French windows
installed for exits to the fire escapes,
and a sanitary closet is under con
struction at Chase Creek and the
grounds of Chase Creek are soon to
be leveled and graded and put into
a suitable playground, thus taking the
children out of the streets.
There are many more little changes
that have been made by the board and
many more which they expect to make
before school starts that will give
credit to their interest and attention
to school matters.
Every effort of the board of trus
tees has been in the direction of per
manency in repairs and improvements
of buildings and lots, economy to the
taxpayers and patrons of th schools,
and comfort, safety and efficiency to
the children. The present improve
ments of the erade buildings with
Ithe new building for manual training,
domestic economy and auditorium,
and a few changes in the basement of
the high school building yet to be
made will make our buildings as
good as any in the state. The expense
of maintenance will greatly decrease
after the present year while the effi
ciency will increase about fifty per
cent. The most sanitary plants in
town will be the school buildines.
Rut nothing is too good for the hcild
ren. The board believes the school
buildings should be the best and the
rooms should compare favorably with
the best homes in our city. If the
schools are to teach good citizenship
they must have the right kind of
equipment and surroundings to make
good citizens. With these conditions
met by the taxpayers and patrons of
our schools they have a right and
should demand the best in the way of
teachers and their teaching, not only
in the school room, but outside as
well. And in this part of the effi
ciency of our school system we are
fortunate in having among our teach
ing force the best in the state and
among the best in the country.
The teachers for the coming year as
reported to date are as follows:
J. A. Davis, high school and depart
mental. T. L. Bouse, Principal, mathemat
ics. Gladys Boise, English.
F. M. Walek, Science and Athletics.

GREENLEE COUNTY
TAX RATE FIXED
BY BOARD
Board of Supervisors Meet and FU
Tax Rate for the Year 1916 as Pre
vlded by Law. Rate 17 Cents Low
er Than Last Year.
The Board of Supervisors met 05
Monday of this week for the purpose
of making changes ordered by the
btate Board of Equalization and fix
ing the tax rate for the year 1916.
The State rate this year has been
placed at 40 cents on the $1.00 valu
ation, being a cut from 54 cents last
year and the county rate has been
cut three cents, from 63 to 60. Thus
the rate for State and County taxes
this year will be $1.00 on the $100.00
valuation or a reduction of 17 cents
aver that of the year 1915.
This should cause satisfaction among
the taxpayers of Greenlee county and
even those who have had their valu
ations increased will not notice the
difference in the total amount of
their taxes as the 17 cent cut will In
most cases more than offset the raise.
The present board is to be congratu
lated on the low rate It has been able
to fix. They have given the county
a good business administration and
their efforts have ben consistently 111
favor of the taxpayer.
The following comparative table Of
the rate for 1916 and .1315 will be

Murphy Visits District
Owen Murphy, democratic candid
ate for State Tax Commissioner, has
been calling on the voters of the
Clifton-Morenci district this week. Mr
Murphy is a resident of Tombstone
and is at the present time recorder of
Cochise county He has had several
years experience in public service and
if his past record is any criterion his
fitness for the office to which he as
pires is recognized. Mr. Murphy is a
man of integrity and worth and feels
that he is deserving of a place on the.
tax commission by virtue of his quali
fications. Auto Buried in Waters-
Ross Jennings, representing a lum
ber firm of El Paso, was spending
the first of the week in Clifton on busi
ness. After completing his business
here he left for Duncan by auto and
on the way was caught in a severe
rainstorm which threatened for a time
the destruction of the machine. The
car was caught in an arroyo by an
avalanche of water and rocks which
rushed upon the machine and carried
it some distance. The car was
buried up to the radiator in mud and
Mr. Jennings had difficulty in escap
ing from it with his life. A team of
horses was requisitioned and after a
few hours hard work the machine was
hauled to higher ground. The dam
age to the car was small but Mr.
Jennings has no desire for a repeti
tion of the experience.
