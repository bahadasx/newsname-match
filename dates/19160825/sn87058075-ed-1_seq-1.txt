Drowning Accident Affects Creico
Family.
The Sioux Falls, (S. D.) Argus-Lead
er prints the following account of the
drowning on Sunday, Aug. 13th, of a
son-in-law of Mr. and Mrs. E. H. Bents,
of Cresco:
"A shocking accident occurred Sun
day afternoon when John Haas, one of
the best known conductors on the Mil
waukee railroad, met his death in the
waters at Wall Lake.
Mr. Haas was entertaining several
small nephews, and decided yesterday
to take them out to Wall Lake to
bathe. Accompanied by Mrs. Haas and
her mother, Mrs. E. H. Bents, of Cres
co, la., who arrived Saturday evening,
and several fellow trainmen, the party
arrived at the bathing beach about five
o'clock. In spite of the fact that the
water was rather chilly, Mr. Haas and
his nephews were soon in the water.
He was apparently in the best of health,
and had been playing with the children
for some time, staying fairly close to
the shore in not more than for or five
feet of water.
"In a few minutes he was seen to be
apparently floating on the surface of
the water, and Mrs. Haas became
frightened and gave the alarm. He
was at once brought to the Bhore,
where Dr. E. A. Archer administered
heroic treatment, but without being
able to awaken any sign of life.
A pulmotor was secured but it proved
fruitless, and the physician was of the
opinion thai death might be due to
heart failure.
"John Haas was born on the 3rd of
September, 1875, in Minnesota. On
June 1, 1907, he was married to Miss
Beulah S. Bents at Armour, S. D., and
the young couple went to live at Sioux
City. He had been a brakeman on the
Milwaukee road since July 25, 1897, and
was promoted to be conductor on Sep
tember 9, 1901. About five years ago
he was transferred to Sioux Falls, and
he and Mrs. Haas have since that time
made their home in this city. He was
a member of the Elks and the Moose,
and of the Order of Railway Conductors,
and was well loved by all with whom
he came in contact."
Mrs. Haas will return to Cresco with
Mrs. Bents in the course of a few
gftQ^a xnw. w'n
Baptist Church.
The usual services will be held next
Sunday morning at the Baptist Church.
