ZIEGLER'S MEN
GET 7-F00T SHARK
Monster Dragged Out by
Tail After Exciting
Battle.
[Bt Telr-rraph to Tha Trtbun# 1
Stamford, Conn., Aug. L'-l. William
Zieglcr, jr..of Great Island, Collender's
Point, Noroton, is the proud possessor
to-night of a seven-foot man-eating
shark that was caught this evening off
his bathing beach at the island. It was
one of a school of twelve which had
broken shark hooks galore and had ig
nored volleys of .45-calibre bullets fired
at it by the young millionaire and his
employea.
Yr-tcrdny Joseph Crane, Mr. Zieglcr's
stable manager, had a hook made of
horseshoe iron, and last night he baited
lt ?ith blackfish. This afternoon a
foot shark swallowed the bait
and tried to run off with the line of
rope and chain. ft was brought ashore
after an hour'a fight, and just as Zieg
ler employea were landing it the heavy
hook, straightened out in the strugglc,
slipped out of the shark's mouth.
The fhark was too far gone to swim
off. and Crane leaped into the water
and caught it by the tail. He held on
while other employea hauled him and
the shark out and killed the tish witn
an anchor.
Mr. Ziflglflr, who had superintended
the .hurl; tishing during the week and
had takefl Biany shots at the school,
was aammoaed from N'ew York and he
gave ordera tfl have the shark stuffed
f.n.! mounted.
Capt Sanborn, of Mr. Zicgler's
yaeht Gani, examinod the "hark shortly
flfter it was landed and he Bflid it was
a man eater. Meantime, the Crirn

She Vanishes After
S. M. Van Alien, Once
Rich, Shoots Himself.
BITTER LETTERS
LEFT TO FAMILY
Visitor Says Man, Though
Married, Hoped to
Wed Her.
Stephen M. Van Alien. expert riflfl
shot, former superintendcnt of Madison
Square Garden and manager of the
Sportsman's Show for many years,
killed himself yesterday in the mahog?
any furnished cabin of his motor boat
Hunter, moored in the Hudson River, off
138th Street. He fired both barrels of
a shotgun into his breast after scrib
bling notes to his mother, Mrs. Henry
A. Van Alien, a wealthy resident of Ja?
maica, and to his lawyer. These mes
sages cxplained that a long series of
tinancial and domestic ditncultie. had
prompted him to take his life.
On a table in the cabin the police
found a sealed letter addressed to Mrs.
J. M. I'lonoran, Suite No. 1315, Congress
Hotel, Chieago. Through her, the wom?
an of mystery in the case, the death of
the sportsman was diseovered.
For two years Van Alien had been
1 ivint. in seelusion on his hunting boat,
members of the motor boat colony
abovr i3f.th Street told detectivea
from the Fourth Branch Bureau. Al?
though he came ashore frequently to
buy provisions and attend to his busi?
ness affairs, he had little communica
; tion xvith other owners of boats in tha
colony. They knew of him only ai a
recluse.
At 9:80 yesterday a telephone call
for Van Alien xvas received at the
boathouse near 138th Street, where he
rented accommodations for the
Hunter. A woman's voice cxplained
that Mrs. I lonoran, of Chieago, was
ealling him.
Woman's Request I.e-ads to Discorery.
N'orman Dickerson, one of the boot
men, stepped outside on the float to
hail the Hunter, which was resting
within a few hundred yards of the in
terned German liners at 1.15th Street.
He could raise no answer from the
boat.
"Please find out if anything has hap?
pened to him." the woman hegtted over
the telephone. "I have an appointment
with him at 11. and I want to be sure
that he Ifl there"
Dirkerson nulled out to the Hunter
in n roxvboat an.l climbed aboard after
ealling to Van Alien several times. He
foand the body on the floor of the
cabin. The bontman notified thc police
of the West l-'.".th Street station. An
arabalanee anrgeon from Kniekerbocker
Hospital reported that death had been
lmtiintaneous.
Ai Patrolman Kr-sig approached thc
boathoaaa afttr complcting his cxam
inal on ,,f the motor boat, he was told
that r. womiin xvished to Kee him. She
wr.s drflflflfld in stylish clothes. dis
played expensive jewelry, and had
I iu-'hed to the pier in a tuxicab.
"Have vou n letter there tor Mra.
1 Ulor.ornn," at the Congress Hotel in
I ChieagoV she nsked. Kssig had the
letter ifl hiis hand.
"Then piense give it tJ me I m Mrs.
I'lonoran," sho eried. "I must find out
xx hat rniule him do it."
"This letter must go to the coroner s
' ofTice before you ean have it," the
patrolman said.
"Rut I'm entitled to it," she persisted.
"Mr. Van Alien uas to marry me," she
added, according to the police
Snys Divorce Wai Planned.
When itiformed that Mr. Van Alien
had ? widow and si\teen-year-old son
Iiving in Jamaica, Mrs. I'lonoran ex
; plained that she knew lt, bat Van
Alien hoped to bring about the mar
riage anyhow, She became |0 excited
in her eftorts to get the letter tnat she
fainted.
Afl toOfl ns she recovcrcd she nurnea
to her ta leab and aaed Boray before
the police ascertained her addl-l
this eity. The letter addressed to Mrs.
Clonoriin was turned over to the cor
uiier's office without being made public.
Hoth the other tinal meesagflfl left by
Van Alien were BCTawled in pencil on

120 Tons of French Beard
Doomed by New Army Order
Artists, Philosophers and Litterateurs Mourn Passing of
"Beauty, Soul and Jewel" of France by Shaving
Decree to Men in Trenches.
Paria, Aug. 24. The heard of the
French soldier has been doomed in an
army order, which directs that the men
at the front must ahavc all except
mustnehcs. The order has been the
signal for the outburst of a humorous
and ironic discussion in the trench
newspapers, to which some of the most
famous Krench artists, philosophers
and literary men have contributed.
Jean Richepin, the dramatiat, writ?
ing in the "Fuse," says: "The beard
has gone, but what ia the difference to
us? In place of it it is courage that
grows. Let the beard fall and French
courage grow."
Edmond Roatand celebrates the
beard in verse aa a aymbol of "all the
beauty all of France, a aoul, a jewel,
a torch, a prod."
Henri Bergson says: "I am not
afraid to go so far aa to aay that the

STRIKE LEADER
HELD IN $200,000
Three Deputies Guard
Patrick F. Duffy in
Bridgeport Hotel.
I Br Telf|r?ph to Thfl Tribune ]
Bridgeport, Conn., Aug. 24. Patrick
F. Duffy, an organizer of thc American
Federation of Labor, is held at the At?
lantic Hotel in lieu of $200,000 bonds
following the service of a body writ
Tuesday evening by Deputy Sheriff
Thomas Cunningham. Duffy ia guard?
ed by three extra deputies, one of
whom itays in the same room with hin
overnight. *
Txvo officers of the national organ?
ization were with Duffy when the sher?
iff approached him. The sheriff had
warrants for the other two as well.
The bonds in their cases would have
heen $200,000 caeh, thus at one swoop
increasing tlie liabilities of the asso?
ciation hy $f,00,000. Duffy was quick
to grasp the situation and his two
companions vanished before the war
rants could be served.
Thc announced decision of Duffy t>
sue thc four manufacturing mouider.-,
who made complaint against him, and
Deputy Sheriff Cunningham besides,
caused the plaintifTV attorney to fore
go the privilege of inearcerating Duffy.
The deputy sheriff and his assistant.
merely gave Duffy a ride past the jail
in an automobile and then took him
baek to the hotel.
Duffy is detained on a body writ is?
sued on request of the Pequonnock
Foundry. The suit is for $50,000 dam
r.ges, but as the defendunt is also held
in connection with the alleged iniury
xvhieh three other eoncerns . the Mon
umental Bronze Conipany, thc Bridge?
port Deoxidized Bronze. Company an.l
the Manufacturers' Iron Foundry- havo
suffere.l through the strikes, three ad?
ditional actions for $50,000 are tt^eJ
against him. As Duffy has no attach
ablc property in Conneetieut, it wa*
deeaaed necessary to hold him on ?
body writ.
Duffy Arcused of Threats.
The writ alleges that the defendant
conspired to hurt the business of the
eoncerns. Further, he is charged with
ealling at the offices of the foundries
and threatening to call a strike if the
demands flf the union men were no!
complied with. It is also set up in the
writ that he ;hreatened the wives and
children of the workers if the men re?
turned ti their former employment. It
is stated thc* Duffy, while a former
mouider and prominent officer in the
New York locais of that trade, is not
now connected with the moulders'
union, but is a representative of the
American Federation of Labor.
Attorney Thomas M. Cullinan, coun?

for the bond, which will arrive to-mor?

CZAR MASSES
MEN FOR DRIVE
INTO BULGARIA
Rumanians Reported
Ready to Join in
Invasion.
GREEKS RUSH
TO COLORS
Bulgars Advance Twenty
five Miles and Clear
Struma Line.
[Br CaMa to Th* TrtMirrfl.l
London, Aug. 25.?Russia is pre
paring to strike at Bulgaria through
Rumania. The Czar has massed a
large army on the Rumanian frontier
and on the banks of the Russian
Danube for this blow, according to
a "Morning Post" dispatch from
Budapest.
The "Az Est," which gives cred
ence to this report, also states that
strong Rumanian forces have been
concentrated on the lower Danube
and the Pruth, ready to join with the
Russian army advancing through the
country.
Berlin for the last few days has in-!
sisted that Rumania already had
joined the Entente, but London has
had no conlirmation of these dis-1
patehes. Rumanian intervention on
the side of the Allies undoubtedly
would force the hand of King Con-'?
stantine and bring Greece into the
war against the Teutonic allies.
Greeks Rueh to Colora.
Greek volunteers are rushing to
the colors to resist the Bulgar threat,
While Czar Ferdinand's troops con?
tinue to advance east of Struma, the
battlc at Seres is still in progress, ac?
cording to advices from Athens.
The Greek garrison at Seres has been
reinforced by officers and men assem
bled at Salonica. To them has been
added a corps of Albanians. Many of
the Greek troops are reported to have
taken places in the ranks of the Allied
armies and a furious struggle is prom
iscd.
Thus the issue between the Teutonic
allies and Greece has come to a head.
King Constantine and his ministers
are making great efforts to prevent
trouble, but the situation is getting
rapidly beyond their control.
Greeks Ordered to Retreat.
The General Staff at Athens has or?
dered that the Greek troops at Seres
retire before the Bulgars. But the
commander of the town has rallied
around him a strong force and seems
determined to dispute the Burgar ad?
vance.
Meanwhile the Venizelis.ts at Athens
and throughout Greece, rt-alizing that
their opportunity has come, are agitat
ing for intervention on thc side of the
Kntente. 1 heir ta.,k is made easier by
the intense feeling roused in Greece
over the heroic resistance offered by
thc Greek garrisons to the Bulgars.
Crisis May Come Sunday.
The crisis may come next Sunday,
when a mass mcting will be held in
celehration of the anniversary of 1909.
Athens is stirrd to its depths by the
Bulgar mnaco. The repeated promises
of the Teuton envoys that Greek sov
ercignty xvould be respected have failed
to allay the fears of the populace.
Many in the capital demand that Greece
strike now, before the Bulgar reaches
his goal.
In the battle whieh continues with
unabated fury on the whole front north
of Salonica, the pressure against the
Allied wings has not relaxed. The Bul
goro have now foreed their way on the
left wing twenty-Iive miles south of
Florina, while on the right they claim
to have cleared the Allied forces frora
the left bank of the Struma.
Serb. Win Back Height.
The Serbs are battling heroicallv to
stcm the Buigar tide. ln an effort to
check the advance west of Lake Os
trovo, they have lBiinched an offensive
along the mour.tainous front around
the Moglenica Valley and have suc?
eeeded in winning back a height near
Lake Ostrovo. ?
Because of the hilly country here,
the Serbfl are confronted with a stu
yendous task. They must drive the
Bulgars from heichts which have
heen strongly fortified. and at the
same time muintain their line to the
west. It is cfltimated that in this
sector the defensive force has an
advantage of three to one over the
attackir.g troops.
Bulgars Ilold Struma Line.
On the extreme ea'tern wirig '.he
Bulgars are tnaintaining their positiooa
along thfl Struma River. For the mo?

lir.es along rhe heights east ol the
river, and io have removed for the time
the threat of an advance toward Soria
and proteeted their flank advancing
toward Kavala.
Because of this pre??ure on the flankfl

FRENCH GAIN
ON MILE LINE
Complete Seizure of
Maurepas?Flank
Combles Ridge.
[ nr Cable to The Tribune 1
London, Aug. 24.-In the faee of
heavy counter strokes, both the British
and the Freneh renewed the attaek
north of the Somme to-day. Both
blows suceeeded in forcing back the
German line.
Priving forward along a front ot
a mile and a quarter, Foch's troops
eompleted the occupation of the vil?
lage of Maurepas and pushed beyond
to a depth of 250 yards.
This advance flanks the German po?
sitions on the ridge guarding Combles
on the south and brings the Freneh
line hcre almost on a parallel with
the front at Clery. The seiiure of
the remaining portions of thflt vil?
lage is thus made comparativcly easjr.
Tho British pushed nearer Thiepval,
gaining 300 yards on a 400-yard front
and winning more spurs of the Thiep?
val ridge. They are now within 500
yarda ot this village, whieh has proved
the strongest buixva.k in the defences
of the second system from Thiepval to
Martinpuich.
Freneh Shell Thirty-Mile Line.
Meanwhile, from Sstrees, the south
ernmoat point of the Freneh offensive
on the Somme. to Lassigny, thirty
miles to the south. Joffre's artillery is
shelling thfl German line night and day.
This may be the prelude to a wider
attack.
A drive in this sector would have
as its purpose the forcing back of the
huge German salient which loops
around Roye and Noyon. lf the Freneh
can cut a gap in the line north of the
apex of the salient, they will endanger
the Cf-rmans at the apex and so force
a retirement.
The new Allied assaults to-day were
preceded by very heavy counter at?
tacks by the Germans. These contin?
ued to increase in violence, but failed
to win any material gain in either the
British or the Freneh sectors of the
Somme front.
At Guillemont. where the British
have been creeping forward steadily,
th" Germans hit Haig's line the hard
cst blow. They reached the parapets
of the British trenches and engaged
the enemy in hand-to-hand combat.
Er.t they were soon beaten off and fell
back to their own trenches.
Sovecourt, at the _outhern end of the
Fri-nch sector, was bombarded heavily
again. This suggests that the Germans
intend to open a counter attack here
soon. In anticipation of this, and in
the effort to clear the way for new
thrusts, the Freneh guns are pounding
away day and night.
Dispatches from the front describe
this bombardment as "of extraordinary
intensity." The canr.onadir.g extends
from Vermandcvillers through Chaul
nes. and Roye to Lassigny. The (ier?
mans, in efforts to quiet it, have sent
many aeros over the Freneh lines, but
Joffre's fliers invariably have driven
thea_ back.
(.erman Losses Severe.
The German losses in their counter
attacks are reported to bc exceedingly
nevere. The Verdun situation has been
r.v. r fld. While the Germans are pay?
ing a heavy toil. the Br'tish and Freneh
have been paying a rema kahly low
price for their gains since the first
three weeks of the big push.
This statement comes from an ob
server who is espeeially well informed.
It explains, too, the deliberate strategy
behind the Allied campaig. The first
attacks forged ahead with heavy loss

Washington, Aug. 24.?The rail
| road dispute to-night took a sudden
'and apparently monacing turn. Tha
I railroad executives, acting on an al
leged promise from the President to
transmit to the four railway brother?
hoods a modified plan of settlement,
decided to-night to present such a
proposal to-morrow. At the same
time they let it be understood that
the whole situation might come to a
head immediately thereafter.
Whether this announcement was
made simply for effect preliminary
to a surrender by the railroads, or is
a serious indication of their doter
mination to fight unless the terms
proposed are made more favorabla
to them cannot be ascertained. It is
regarded as significant, however,
that the brotherhoods denied that
they expected a different proposition
from the one they have accepted.
Wouid Cut Coat in Half.
The gist of the contemplatod pro?
posal that the roads intend to submit
to the President is a modification of
the President's eight-hour plan that
will give the brotherhoods what they
ask, but will cut the inerease in rates
asked by the railroads from $50.
000,000 to perhaps a little more than
half that amount.
The statement from the executive!
which upset the expectation that a
peaceful adjustment of the con'roversy
would be reached before to-morrow
ni-*h? was this:
"At the invitation of President Wil?
son, Messrs. Hale Holden. Judge R. S.
Lovett and Daniel Willard went to the
White House at noon and held a short
conference with the Preaident
"A conference of the railroad execu?
tives waa held at 3 o'eloek and a new
phase of the situation of some impor
tanee was laid before the conference
by the special committee.
"After considerable discussion with?
out deh'nite action an adjournment was
taken until 11 o'eloek to-morrow morn?
ing. In the meantime the special com
: mittee of the president* will continue
, its labors."
Karly Outlook Favorable.
Earlier in the day it was conti.lently
expected that the railroads would reaeh
an early decision to accept the Wilson
plan with whatever assurunce* they
could get of measures for future in?
dustrial peace and rate increases. This
hope was not based on speculation only.
tt". G. Lee. cr.e of the brotherhood
chiefs, told the Tribune correspondent
after Judge William L. Chambera, one
of the Federal mediation board, had
visited the union delegates that he be?
lieved there woald be an agreement by
to-morrow noon. Most of the railway
executives wc-re more optimiitic, too,
than they have been since they camo
to tt'aahington.
Substantiating these indicationa cama
the follow;.- :.*. from the rail
, road executives:
"The railroad presi.ients and mana?
gers met at 11 o'eloek this mor:.ing and
discussed various pha situa
tioa. A rec- n until .'! o'eloek.
Hale Holden, president of the ( h.cago,
Burhngton i '.uincy, as, chairman of
the conference -tated:
"'We are making progress :n elarify
ing our fladflrfltauding. Ther- ar?
many anf-Ies to this i-ubject which re
qurre study. This we are pursuing aa
rapidly as possible.'"
Revolt Had Subaided.
The change to-night appears to ba
predicated upon the activity of Judge
Chambcrs. Pollayiag a conference be?
tween Mr. Holden and President Wil
loti last night, Judge Chambers visited
both the railroad and the employes'
camps. The employes ?rr.> -.lent about
thc mesaage that he brought to them,
but at all events the revolt that broka
out in the rar.ka yesterdny had suo
sided altogether this morning.
It was stated to-night that Judgfl
Chambers had informed the railroad
executives that the .President wou.d
I present a modifted p'.an to the broth
lerhoods without comment from him.
lt was supposed that Ju .j-e Chambera
k-ot assurances from the brotherhooda
that the modiried plan to be submitted
by thc executives would be acceptable
to them. Then aga.n. The Tribune cor?
respondent was infonr.ed reliably that

to effect to-niorrow wyuld n>-.*essarily
have to be n.'iried by t! .? uruona.
