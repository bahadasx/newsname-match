ELEVEN FINED
AT POCAHONTAS
$200 Each Assessed Against
Violators of Revenue Laws?
Believed Now That Boot
Legging Will Stop.
PocahontaB, Aug. 23.?Eleven men
were lined S200 each for violating the
prohibition laws of I'orah.inlas in tbe
cases that came nj before Judge
Owens Tuesday. The state will re?
ceive half the tines and the town the
other half. Tbe cases that have been
tried heretofore were sent to Taze?
well on appeal, but the men who hail
rot been tried decided that they would
compromise rather than continue thu
cases further. It il said that the evi?
dence against some of thorn is strong?
er than against others, but all ag?
reed to compromise and dismiss the
eases. They were all put under a bond
to observe the law in future, and one
of the provisions of a violation now is
that it will mean six months in jail.
It is generally believed that there will
be no boot-leeging among these
people in the future. Messrs. James
Harman, Minter and Minter, and Har?
nes Gillespie represented the prose?
cution, and Messrs. T. C. Bowon, Sex?
ton and Itobeits, and R. O. Crockett,
represented the defense.
After the eases had been disposed
of, Thomas Tinsk-y, a member of the
police force, walked up the street with
a warrant in his pocket for the ar?
rest of one Will Brown, charged with
the same offense. Brown suspected
something, and when he saw Tinsloy
approaching; he ran, notwithstanding
Tinsley's admonitions, and hid behind
an embankment, or log fence, quite
secure from the policeman. Tinsley
gave him some sound advice, to come
out from behind there, but he refused,
whereupon the policeman got a focus
on him and shot the bark elf about six
inches from the negro's nose, and thu
negro decided to adopt the motto of
"safety first" and surrendered to the
policeman. He was taken before Judge
Owens and fined $50.. and promised to
be good in the future.

dues the next time he came to town,
sent along his check by Vanhoozer.
John is thoughtful and considerate,
and hns the thanks of the editor.
The mention of John George's name
recnlls a "merry party" the editor
had the pleasure of entertaining dur?
ing the fair some years ago. The edi?

She's mine and a better car may be

Brother Josh and I had a little sur?
plus in the bank and we 'lowed as
how we ought, to buy an automobile.
Brother Josh thought we orght U>
pay about 91200.00 for our cars but.
1 didn't say mithin. That night Betsy
and me talked and figured tili bed?
time. Betsy had got her heart set on
some things for the house and she
couldn't figure as how it would be
bhowin' good sense and judgment tv>
put. $1200.00 in an automobile and do
without necessities that were so
badly needed in the house. I had
studied this here automobile busi?
ness for a long time and my mind
was already made up what car I
wotdd buy, hut I jest wanted to see
how Betsy would feel about it. and
her good judgment never failed her.
Next, day Josh nnd me went to
town to buy our cars; it had rained
ami the road was wet and slippery.
\fler foolin' around them garges with
Josh for two or three hours he bought.
a big stylish.car for $1200.00.
1 had already phoned in to the Ford
dealer to grease up one of his little
"Tin Lizznrds" and I would come In
for her.
I paid for my car and put the bal?
ance of the $1200.00 in my pocket.
Josh in his big stylish $1200.00 car
and me in my little Kord and $825
left I was taking home to Betsy. Jos'-i
got in his car, pushed a little peddlj
nd off he went. I cranked up my
little Ford and follored him. She
didn't run good at first?none of them
Fords do?the water just biled, the
pedals and steering wheel worked
stiff and the paint on the engine
smelted bad but the gorge man told
me to pay no attention to this so I
just, kept on going and ench mile I
went I could feel her getting better.
About half way home I could see
ahead of me a big fine car stuck in the
mud; as I rambled by I saw Brother
Josh puttin' on mud chains. I went on
home, put up my car. had supper, and
was settin' on the porch readin' the
Clinch Valley News when Brother
Josh drove up all covered with mud
and hot ia the collar and hollered
at me: "Jerry, what was that rattlin*
about your little Road Louse when
you passed me?" I just savs to him:
"Josh, that was the change I had
left from buyin' my car," and he
drove on.
Here is what I did with that
change, and friends, take my advice
and do the same: I handed the differ?
ence in the price of my car and Bro?
ther Josh's over to Betsy?$825.?
and this is what, she done with it:
Brought water in pipes to the
house, cost. $100.00

do and sometimes it won't do that.
Yes, I own a Ford and I have my

ther Josh uses old smelly kerosene
lamps. Betsy and I have a handsome
porcelainc bath tub, while Josh and

Methodists Meet in North Car?
olina to Discuss Plans Pur
Aiding Endowment of the
Atlanta University.
Rev. Dr. D. P. Hurley, the Presid?
ing Elder of the Tttzcwoll District, has
roturncd from the big meeting of
Methodist lenders, which aus hohl nt
Luke Junnluskn, N. C. There wero
present tit this great conference, says
Mr. Hurley, n numbor of Bishops, u
larger number of Presiding Elders,
leading laymen and others from all
over the South. The object of the
meeting seems to have been to discuss
plans, ways and means, for the pro?
secution of the great educational earn
paigll undertaken by the Methodist
brethren for thu endowment and
equipment of the Methodist univers
ity in Atlanta. Ca. It will he recalled
that the Methodist church South lost
Vanderbilt University rome years ugi
in which the church had put, all told,
two million dollars. At this Ullivor
sity the ministers of the Methodist
denomination were educated. It was
the "School of tbe Prophets" of Sou?
thern Me-i. 'isls. owned and controll?
ed by the church.
The trouble started when if was
learned that the leaching in the uni?
versity was not in harmony with luti
doctrines and traditions of the Metho?
dist church. Tbe ruling Bishop look n
hand, ami then somtbing was stalled.
The Bishop was coolly informed Hint
he was not in control, neither wus the
Methodist church, but. the Hoard of
Trustees, And then there was war.
The matter was discussed in Confer?
ence, anil steps taken to establish or
re-establish Methodist control cd' the
University, and lo dictate its curri?
culum. The rest, is history. The matter
wus taken into the Courts of Tenn?
essee. Eminent counsel was employ?
ed hy both sides. A warm and some?
what bitter contest followed, the Con
ferenca of the Methodist church on
one side and the trustees of Vander?
bilt on tbe other side. The Courts
finally decided against the Confer?
ence, and that, the control of the uni?
versity rightfully centered in the
Board of Trustees, with all its appur?
tenances thereto belonging, endow?
ment, and all. The Methodist church
picked up its hat and walked out. of
Nashville, leaving the big pile of
brick, two million dollars endowment
nnd all, in the hands of the Hoard of
Trustees, and said, "We will uslah
lish a school of The Prophets of our
own, under our control, to do with
as we please." A Committee was ap
pointed to select a site and report lo
next Conference. There was a lively
contest between lending cities in dill'
ercnt Stales of the South. Finally,
one man, whose name is no), recalled,
offered to Blurt the subscription list
with the munificent nnd appealing
sum of one million dollars if (lie uni?
versity was established in Atlanta.
That settled if, mill lo make short
work of u long story, the university
was established, and already two mil?
lion dollars has been expended there,
and more in sight. The main object
of tbe great meeting at Junuluska,
was to further the endowment of the
university in Atlanta. Other questions
of a missionary character were dis?
cussed by distinguished missionaries
present.
Cannibals Never Kat a Woman.
Mr. Hurley said that he heard a
number of great addresses the finest
he ever heard. One of these was by
a traveler and missionary investiga?
tor, who has been in every country
and island where human beings live,
investigating conditions and tabulat?
ing fuels for the guidance of mission?
ary workers and intelligent prosecu?
tion of the work of the church.
Among other interesting Hlnlemoilt.l
made by this gentleman, Buys Mr.
Hurley, was, that cannibals were
never known to eat a woman. A great,
cannibal chief, wdio bad eaten a hun
dren men, or helped to do so, was
asked hy this gentleman why a wo?
man was never served up by them.
He replied: "Is big while chief fool?
No eat woman. She works!" This is
the fust time, so far as known, that
an explanation has been given as to
wdiy cannibals do not eat women.
