"The Jefferson highway is bring

and it is accomplishing much good
already in road maintaining,'' said
Mr. Beek. "Despite the fact of the
heavy rains, the roads are in fair
condition. We struck a bad stretch
of road north of Little Falls but work
was being done on the road and there
is no question but that it will be up
to standard in a short time. There
was another bad stretch about four
miles from Bemidji.
"St. Paul is ready to do its share
for this great highway. We have ap
propriated nearly $2,000 for the Jef
ferson association already. We be
lieve that the highway will mean
much to us."
Treaty a Blessing.
Mr. Beek spoke with much praise
in regard to Bemidji.
"The Indian treaty has done
worlds of good for Bemidji," he said.
"When I first came to this city there
were many saloons and the city was
the toughest place I ever saw. To
day the city is hustling and has fine
improvements, as a result of the clos
ing of the saloons.
"The lake shore is fine and I am
glad to see that the city is taking
steps to preserve it. The beautiful
normal school which Will be located
in Bemidji is a cap stone to the
whole thing. There is no question
but that the legislature will be lib

stitution."
Mr. Beek and Rev. Reid left this
afternoon for Bagley.

The origin of the city of Bemidji was

COVERS SALE OF BEER
The only remaining "wet" towns
in Northwestern Minnesota, Red
Lake Falls and Plummer, probably
will be "closed" soon by the Federal
Indian bureau, according to an an
nouncement at the Prohibition head
quarters in Minneapolis.
Instructions just issued by the bu
reau of Indian affairs indicate that
the Indian lid is to be extended by
the government to the territory cov
ered by the treaty of Oct. 2, 1863.
County Votes Wet.
Red Lake county, which went wet
in a county option election last fall,
is the only wet spot left in that ter
ritory, which lies west of the 1855
treaty area, and runs north from Clay
county to the Canadian line.
The 1863 treaty differs from the
1855 treaty, which is being enforced.
It prohibits only the introduction and
sale of "spirituous" liquors, and
brewers claim that beer does not
come under that name.
Statute Covers Beer.
They have been using Red Lake
Falls as a distributing point for
North Dakota and Northern Minne
sota since Moorhead and East Grand
Forks went dry. The department
now declares beer to come under the
statutes.
"The provisions of Sections 2140
and 2141 of the Revised Statutes of
United States," the ruling says,"
shall also apply to beer and other in
toxicating liquors named in the act
of Jan. 30, 1897, and the possession
by a person of intoxicating liquor in
the country where the introduction
is prohibited by treaty or federal
statutes shall be prima facie evidence
of unlawful introduction."

NO CHANGE IN THE
RAILWAY STRIK E!
SITUATION TODAY
President Wilson Holds Another
Conference With Brotherhood
Men.
RAIL PRESIDENTS
DISCUSSING PLANS
(By United Press)
Washington, Aug. 25. With
President Wilson and the rail presi
dents apparently at loggerheads,
President Wilson caused excitement
by suddenly calling the broth
erhood representatives into confer
ence. The conference lasted for an
hour and a half. The brotherhood
men stated after the conference that
the situation remains unchanged.
Rail Heads Confer.
After conferring with Vice Presi
dent Marshall today, President Wil
son sent for the rail executives*for.-?.-mile a
conference."-^***"'.
The railway presidents are work
ing more desperately than ever be
fore in trying to solve the problem
of how to grant an eight-hour day
and make the public literally pay the
freight.
Plan is Discarded.
The entire plan of President Wil
son has not been laid before all the
executives and managers, but its
points have been discussed at themors
various conferences. It developed
after last night's meeting that objec
tions have been raised on the freight
rate increase feature on at least two
grounds. It was argued by some that
there can be no assurance of a
freight increase for no one could
say what the interstate commerce
commission might do and that some
of the most important shippers of
the country have already made it
plain that they are not in sympathy
with any move which may mean a
great increase. It was pointed out
also that although President Wilson
has expressed his belief that such a
freight increase would be granted if
an eight-hour day is given to the em
ployes, no one can tell how the next
election is coming out and there can
be no possibility of an increase before
next March or probably later.
Wage Standards Barred.
Attention was called, too, to the
fact that the commission has held
that it cannot consider wage stand
ards in dealing with proposed rate
increases, although legislation by
congress might remove that difficulty.
The principal arguments against
the idea of a permanent commission
for the prevention or settlement of
strikes were that it would almost cer
tainly be fought by labor in congress
and that while President Wilson
might be entirely willing now to back
such legislation he might not be in a
position to do so when it was pre
posed.
Want Settlement.
Minneapolis, Minn., Aug. 25.
Alarmed lest the deadlock at Wash
ington break up without an agree
ment and a railroad strike come on
and tie up the northwest crop move
ment, northwestern farmers and busi
ness men yesterday were sending
messages to Washington urging arbi
tration.
Minneapolis and St. PaulfirmsandSpalding's
commercial organizations also were
wiring the president. The Minneapolis
Civis and Commerce association sent
a message on behalf of 3,500 mem
bers, giving the view that failure to
apply arbitration in the pending
strike would be a "national calam-
ity." Vr^-
