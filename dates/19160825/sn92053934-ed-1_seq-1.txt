CALLS HEADS
FOR SESSION
EARLY TO
President Wilson Lets Cabi
net Wait While Strike
, Parley Goes On.
PROBLEMS DISCUSSED
Hostility of Railroad Presi
dents to Eight-Hour Day
Tends to Complicate.
Washington, Ang. 25. President
Wilson summoned representatives
of the employers and employes in
volved In the threatened railroad
strike to the White house today
for conferences to discuss pro
posals which have developed out
of his original plan of settlement.
Arrangements were made for
the representatives of employes
to see the president at 10:30
o'clock and for the representa
tives of the emplojers later.
As the conferences anion? the
railroad executives progress it was
said the presidents were standing
more closely together for arbitra
tion than at any time since they
had assembled here.
It was indicated that the com
munication being prepared for
President Wilson would contain a
further insistence on arbitration.
Late this afternoon Presidents
Lovett, Holden and Willard, of the
Union Pacific, Burlington and Bal
timore & Ohio, respectively, went
to the White house. It was un
derstood they would outline to
President Wilson the conclusion
of the select committee of execu
eives so far.
The railway, strike negotiations re
solved themselves today, outwardly at
least, into a more or less confused
state.
Expressions of optimism from both
sides were not so free as they were
yesterday and feeling heretofore gen
eral among the managrs that a plan
to include the eight-hour day would
be found was not so evident. Some of
the railway executives reverted to
their prediction that it never would be
conceded.
President Wilson today conferred
with the four brotherhood heads. All
parties to the conference steadfastly
refused to say what was talked about.
The railroad executives conferred
among themselves during the day and
it was thought possible they "might
later go to the White house.
Some of the more optimistic still
had hopes of a final decision being
reached, before tomorrow night.
The executives and managers devot
ed practically no time today to con
sideration of freight rate increases or
I settlement of future strikes but cen
i tered on the length of the working day
and pay.
The brotherhood heads declared they
were standing on President Wilson s
plan and had not changed their atti
tude a particle.
Kept Cabinet Waiting.
The four brotherhood heads remain
ed with the president an hour and a
half, but would make no statement on
leaving. The president kept the cabi
net waiting for an hour to continue nib
conference with the railroad men.
"The situation, insofar as we are
concerned." A. B. Garretson, spokes
man for the employes later said, "is
absolutely unchanged. No complete
concrete proposition to which the rail
roads will agree has been tendered us.
Our position is exactly the same as it
was when we accepted the president's
plan."
The brotherhood leaders went from
the White Jiousc to report to a meet
ing of the men. but. insisted they had
nothing particular to communicate. W.
G. Lee, of the trainmen, gave out cop
ies of an order which he said had been
sent by the Northern Pacific, to sta
tion agents directing them to get lo
cal interests to send telegraphic pro
tests to President Wilson against
settling the controversy by other
means than arbitration. The telegrams,
Mr. Lee declared, were evidence of
what the men characterize as a prop
aganda against the president's plan.
Railway presidents today were
confronted with a number of objec
tions to their tentative plan for meet
ing the union brotherhoods' demands
by granting the eight-hour day on con
dition that freight rate increases and
public Investigation of future wage
disputes be assured. They arranged
another meeting shortly before noon
to consider their special committee's
proposal and it appeared possible that
a final conclusion would be postponed
until next week.
These conditions weighed against
the chances of a rate increase:
There la no means of assuring what
action the Interstate commerce com
mission might take, particularly Inas
much as previously it has indicated
unwillingness to consider wage stand
ards In dealing with proposed rate
Increases; strong Influence of big ship
pers probably would be thrown
against higher rates; President Wil
son's stand for an Increase would
amount to little if he should fail of
reelection; regardless of other haz-

REM EN CAUGHT
11 BRITISH NET?
German Snb-Freighter Taken In Dov
er Straits, Is Story Told by English
Marine Officer in "ew York.
New York, Aug. 25. The New York
City News association quotes an offi
cer of the British merchant marine
who arrived here today aboard the
White Star steamship Baltic as saying
that the German submarine Bremen
had been captured by the British and
33 of her crew of 35 made prisoners.
The Bremen, according to the account,
ryiX'r.apteured in the straits of Dover
in a steel net on Aug. 2. Two members
of her crew lost their lives.
The Bremen, it was said, while en
meshed in the net was sighted by a
British patrol boat, her stern under
water and her bow high above the
surface. After endeavoring ror a time
to extricate the wreck, the patrol boat
seamed away for Dover with her pris
oners. According to the officer quoted the
British government has maintained si
lence in regard to the capture, as an
other German trans-Atlantic subma
rine, the Amerika, was said to be on
the way here and it was hoped to cap
ture her also.
ards, new rates could not be put into
effect before next March.
The greatest element of uncertainty
regarding the proposed legislation for
creating a federal body to investigate
labor demands before a strike might
be allowed was the probable hostility
of labor leaders to the plan.
Continued hostility of many presi
dents to the eight-hour day under any
circumstances complicated the situa
tion further.
Dumps Guns in Lake.
Chicago, Aug. 25. Enough explos
ives to blow up a battleship lay at the
bottom of Lake Michigan today off Chi
cago harbor. Yesterday was "cleanup
day" in the city custodian's office and
revolvers, rifles, dynamite and nitro
glycerine confiscated in police raids
were dumped into the lake.

CHICAGO RECLUSE
PREY OF FRIENDS
Probe for Tanlshed Millions of Edward
Morrison Eeveals Many Sen
sational Features.
Chicago, 111., Aug. 25. Edward W.
Morrison, the 80-year-old recluse
whose vanished millions are a sub
ject of investigation before Judge Lan
dis in the United States district court,
was declared today to have been
mulcted out of property valued at $5,
000,000 by a coterie of strange char
acters within the last 20 years.
Francis J. Houlihan, counsel for
Morrison's creditors, declared that
unscrupulous lawyers, women and
hatitues of Chicago's underworld,
came into the life of the aged man,
whose wealth is estimated fro $3,000,
000 to ?8,000,000, to obtain his money.
He was taken on trips to other cities,
Attorney Houlihan declared, women
were brought to see him and new char
acters introduced to keep hl3 fortune
dwindling.
Search of the recluse's quaint, old
two-story home in which was, thought
he had concealed vast sums of money
revealed $11.73 in cash and a bunch of
old papers, cancelled checks and notes.
In one packet almost one hundred
"I. O. U.'s" written in various hands
but unsigned, and which totalled some
thing over $150,000, were found. Each
slip of paper bore "I. O. U.'s" for
amounts ranging from $o00 to $7,000.
No trace of deeds, titles and other
records of ownership to property, re
puted to be worth $6,000,000, were
found.
Investigation into the affairs of
Morrison has revealed that James It.
Ward, counsel for the aged man, is
holding more than $2,000,000 worth of
property conveyed to him by Morrison.
John Sommers, a Jeweler, disposed o."
$200,000 of Morrison's fortune in "en
tertaining" him. Mrs. Kate Hiller, for
merly keeper of a lace shop, obtained
$70,000 in cash and $57,000 in bonds
during the life of . Morrison's wife
who died in 1909. They were gifts,
Mrs. Hiller asserted.
Subpoenas have been issued for the
appearance In court of the two Burn
stein girls, Margaret and Alice, whom
Morrison recently adopted and who
their reputed father, Joseph Burn
stein, a junk dealer, declares Morri
son is the real father.
Under the terms of the will left by
Morrison's father, James M. Morrison,
the entire estate should go to the city
of Chicago if the son died childlesB.
Two United States deputy marshals
battered down the doors of the Morri
son home after they had been denied
admission, and served a subpoena on
Mrs. Anna Brlggs, Morrison's house
keeper, to appear before Judge Landis.
She was found hiding in the attic.
