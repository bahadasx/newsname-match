PAGEANT CONCERT TO BE
"DIFFERENT" AND VARRIED j
The Concert, under direction of Mr.
Edward C. Barroll, which is to be giv
en on Friday night, September IGtlt,
in connection with the three day Page
ant and Hoine-Coming, promises to
Krt rtf tha hiircrfist nnH most at-
"hp . - iji n -
tractive feature's of the three daysr
It will be given at tne rram
grounds, on the Ozark Athletic Field
formerly known as the "old fair
grounds" in the western part of
Farmington, on the car line.
Barroll's Concert Orchestra, justly
famous throughout the country as a
musical organization of real merit,
will contribute the larger part of the
program for the evening, offering se
lections of a popular character such
as appeal to the tastes of the mass of
the public. As Mr. Barroll himself
will have his hands full in the direc
tion of the concert as a whole, the di
rection of the orchestra for the eve
ning will be in the hands of Prof.
Hugh Porter.
Besides the orchestra there will be
solo and specialty numbers contribut
ed by talented musicians from all
parts of the county as well as Farm
ington. Among those Mr. Barroll has
asked to appear upon this program
are the following:
Mr. L. B. Pringle of Bonne Torre,
Mandolin virtuoso.
Master Ted Graves of Framington,
Tuba soloist.
Miss Irene Goff of Desloge, contral
to. Miss Barbara Caroline Tullock of
Farmington, violinistc.
Mi. J. J. Roberts of Farmington,
delineator of quaint characters. .
Mrs. Fannie Shaw of Farmington,
pianiste.
Mrs. O. H. Duggin of Farmington,
violiniate.
Miss Claire Evans of Bonne Terre,
interpreter of folk-song.
Miss Louise Morris of Farmington,
vocalist.
Father Cunningham of Desloge, vi
olinist. Miss Lavinia Rozier of Farmington,
lyric soprano.
Mr. Lyman Barrow of Bonne Terre,
trombone soloist.
Mrs. Ethel Morris Arnold of Fed
eral, pianiste.
Mr. Otto Long of Bonne Terre, ten
or and cornetist.
Mr. Milton Tucker of Flat River,
violinist.
Mr. Laurence A. Smith of Farro
ington, marimbaphone artist.
Messrs. Joe and Frank Zimmer of
Flat River, "rag time" singers and
fun makers.
Several other attractive numbers
are under consideration, and others
will probably be asked to contribute
.something to the program. Several
"suprise numbers" are in progress of
rehearsal, at least two of which will
1., nmr tn Pnrminfftnn and
the people of the county on a concert
program, it is certain mose wr.o at
tend will be well repaid and will be
royally entertained for the evening.
Barroll has won s reputation for stag
ing successful concerts, correctly judg
ing the real capabilities of talent and
securing for any program people who
"really can do things." So this con
cert may be looked forward to as an
ambitious effort perhaps never before
attempted. The open air feature is
unique the concert being out in the
open with a background of natural
greenery and the sky for a sounding
hoard the same as the Pageant.
The new "manager of the Waters
Press," a job shop for which there
is no need in Farmington, is surely a
"hot air merchant" for true, judging
from some advertising letters he has
been distributing about, the diction of
which indicates that he has no place
in a real print shop, except under a
competent foreman. Farmington has
two of the best newspapers to be
found in the entire State, and in con
nection with thera are job shops of
like high character. There is no place
here for such "wild-catting" job shops,
such as the "Waters Press" appears
to e under its present mismanagement.
SAVE MOVING EXPENSES
Our Republican friends contend that
they are gaining in Missouri by reason
of the large addition annually to our
population from Republican Illinois
and Republican Iowa who are attract
ed by our land bargains.
And what drove them out of Illinois
and Iowa?
High taxes.
What was the real controlling influ
ence that induced them to locate in
Missouri?
Low taxes.
What is the tax rate in Republican
Illinois?
Forty-nine cents on the $100 valua
tion. What is the tsx rate in Republican
Iowa?
Forty-eight cents on the $100 valu
ation. What is the tax rate in Democratic
Missouri ?
Only EIGHTEEN CENTS on the
$100 much less than half of either
of the States referred to.
It is true, perhaps, from force of
habit, some of these new-comers may
be voting the Republican ticket- .
But surely only from force of habit,
not from intelligent investigation and
reasoning.
Extravagance in Republican States
in the management of governmental
affairs, is responsible for the sky-high
tax rates.
New-comers have only to stop and
think what would happen should the
Republicans be put in charge in Mis
souri. The Republican new-comers would
soon be on the lookout for a location
in another Democratic State!
The wise thing for these new-comers,
who thoughtlessly voted the Re
publican ticket in their old home State
until Republican high taxes became
so burdensome that, for self-protection,
they were compelled to move to
a Democratic State to get relief, to do
is to help keep Missouri Democratic
and saev moving expenses.
"I would not," declares Mr. Hughes,
"hesitate to go to war to protect the
interest of Americans abroad; m
other words, Mr. Hughes as President
would sacrifice the life of every
American boy, if need be, to help John
D. Rockefeller corner the oil produc
tion in Mexico. Is that the sort of a
President the American mothers are
seeking?
SUCCESSFUL OPERATION
Joseph "H. Story was successfully
operated upon the last of the week, at
the Farmington Hospital, the opera
tion being performed by Dr. Geo. L
Watkins, assisted by Drs. Graves and
Weber. Mr. btory had been a peri
odical sufferer from his affliction for
some time past, and the successful op
eration will be the source of unbound
ed gratitude from himself, family and
friends.
However, it is altogether likely that
another operation will soon be neces
sary, in order to restore him to vig
orous health, as his intestines were
found to be in a badly tangled condi
tion, which is likely to retard his com
plete restoration to perfect health.

Sherrif Trusted
Her Too Far
When Judge Huck was here last
Friday Prosecuting Attorney Davis
filed before him an information charg
ing John Wilkson and his wife with
contempt of court for violating the
temporary injunction issued against
them on July 12, forbidding them
keeping a restaurant where any kind
of drink, "soft" or otherwise, was sold.
Wilkson had been convicted of con
ducting a "blind tiger" at the pre
vious regular term of the Circuit
Court, had appealed his case and was
out under appeal bond; but the Pros
ecuting Attorney had information
that he persisted in his violation of
the local option law and procured the
injunction against both Wilkson and
his wife.
The information filed before Judge
Huck last F'riday for contempt of
court for violating the injunction in
cluded both John and Mrs. Wilkson,
and on the strength of this informa
tion Judge Huck signed an order
commanding the Sheriff to have them
before him on Saturday. August 26th.
In obedience to this command, Sher
iff Williams went to Bonne Terre last
Monday to arrest them, but found that
Wilkson had skipped gone to ML
nois, it was said. Mrs. Wilkson, how
ever, was at home, and Sheriff Wil
liams, in company with the Consta
ble, arrested her and brought her to
I'armington, and Tuesday morning
was guarding her in the court house
yard. Mrs. Wlikson asked permission
of him to go to Attorney B. H. Boy
er's office to consult him, giving her
promise that she would return after
seeing her lawyer and consulting with
him. In the trustfullness of his heart
Sheriff Wliliams granted her request,
and then went home to lunch.
But Mrs. Wilkson disregarded her
word and parole. When she came out
of Mr. Boycr's office, which is in the
Farmington Bank building, she walk
ed to the Post Office, turned the cor
ner, and in company with one John
Craft, a "bird of feather" who had al
so been fined for illegally selling in
toxicants, went on around the souare
to Mayberry, Byington & Tulfock's
livery and garage, hired an automo
bile, and it is said put on speed to
DeSoto. Sheriff Williams says he
thinks she made for Illinois. But her
little escapade hasn't made it any bet
ter for her husband or herself only
aggravated the offense.
Democrats
Organizing
Francis A. Benham, secretary of the
Democratic County Central Commit
tee, has sent out notices for a meeting
to be held in the court house at 1:30
o'clock next Saturday afternoon, Aug
ust 2fith. Every member of the Coun
ty Committee, as well as all Democrat
ic candidates, are urged to attend this
meeting, as the business that will bo
acted upon will be wholly in the in
terest of putting over every candi
date on the Democratic ticket in No
vember. Everyone interested in the success
of Democracy is also invited to at
tend this meeting. A speaker, sent
by the State Committee, will perhaps
address the gathering, and there will
also be other speeches. The principle
intention of this meeting is to see
that everything is started off as it
should be, and that proper arrange
ments are made to keep tl.ings right.
Tribute to Roach
Cornelius Roach is a thoroughbred.
No living white man was ever given a
rawer deal than Roach got whip
sawed, double-crossed, flim-flammed
and jockeyed to defeat yet he comes
up smiling like the Prince of Ameri
cans that he is. There are no sore
spots on his anatomy that are on ex
hibition. And now that it is over and
our motive cannot be questioned, we
want to say that Cornelius Roach is
one of the fairest, whitest men we have
ever known in public life. He is
faithful, efficient, honest, truthful,
dependable, conscientious and every
thing else a real man should be. And
another thing he knows the meaning
of gratitude and never forgets a kind
ness shown him and that's the rarest
virtue in the kingdom of politics.
Kelly Pool, in Centralia Courier.
BABY PARTIES
The very young babies in town have
enjoyed two social diversions the past
week, which were very pleasant occa
sions for the tiny guests, their moth
ers and grand mothers. They were
Alta Marie Isaacs, Decatur, III.;
Jane Gray Donnely, St. Louis; Jones
Edward Klein of Arkansas, Gwendolin
Jane Elizabeth Robinson, Laurence
Augustus Smith, Jr., Robert O'Neil
Lloyd. They were the guests of Mrs.
D. L. Delaney one day. and had their
pictures taken on the lawn, all being
such good children when told to "look
pleasant," so the pictures were charm
ing. A second day they were the
guests of Mrs. E. J. McKmney, and
the babies took home their little place
cards, a cardboard rattle and a sou
venir box of talcum powder. The
grandmothers enjoyed the occasion as
much as the younger guests.
. The Times management will re
ceive, receipt for and publish names
and amount of all contribute rs to the
Democratic State campaign fund.
Early contributions will be thankfully
received. Read the notice in another
column of this issue.
ttn the Toils
Last week J. J. Roberts loaned
Sam Holladay $200, taking a mort
gage on a Hudson six automobile as
security and holding the machine as
collateral. Mr. Roberts, who is cash
ier of the St. Francois County Bank,
also cashed a personal check on the
Bank ol Hat River for him for a
i small sum. Holladay, who is a gen
! ial and genteel looking young man of
about 2S years and married, was
reared in the Minnith vicinity, Stc.
Genevieve county, and has been living
at Flat Kiver on and off for the last
ten years and was well known to Mr.
Roberts. After taking the mortgage
on the machine Mr. Roberts went to
the couit house to have it recorded
and looking it over discovered that the
machine had not been registered in
this county, but in St. Louis, and that
Holladay had given that city as his
residence instead of Flat River. On
inquiry lie also found that Holladay
had no tanas in the Hat Kiver Kank
and that there was a prior mortgage
on the machine, which he had been told
was clear. This first mortgage Mr.
Roberts satisfied in order to hold the
machine.
He then swore out a warrant for
: the arrest of Holladay on a charge of
obtaining money under false pretense
j and sent Sam Doss, armed with this
warrant, to St. Louis to effect his ar-
' rest. Doss usually gets what he goes
1 after, and through his acquaintance
with the detective force he soon found
his man. But the St. Louis officers
thought l hoy had a more serious com
plaint against Holladay and insisted
on holding him on a charge of being
associated with a gang of automobile
thieves in that city which has been
pretty active of late.
It has subsequently developed that
two tutos which Holladay had sold at
Flat River one to George May and
one to Mr. Spofford were stolen ma
chines, I he owners of which have
proven and recovered their property.
Holladay's friends and acquaintances
in the Lead Belt are very much sur
prised to hear of him in this new role.
Sudden Death of
Clarence Counts
Clarence Counts, brother of Stephen
Counts of this place, while engaged
with another man at Streeter, North
Dakota, last week in digging a well
was overcome with fire-damp, and
both he and his companion were dead
before they could be drawn up. Mr.
Counts, who had been living at Kan
sas City the past year, left there
about two weeks ago for Streeter.
Previous to that time for about nine
years' "he had been living at Bertig,
Ark., whre his widowed wife and a
little daughter of eight years are still
living.
His body was shipped from Streeter
for Bertig, Ark., but was encased in
a wooden casket, and when it reached
Kansas City the health authorities
would not allow it to proceed, so his
sister, Mrs. T. P. Vance, who lives in
that city, secured a lot and hud the
body interred there.
Mr. Counts was born and reared in
Ste. Genevieve county, and left this
State about ten years ago for Arkan
sas. Besides his widow and little
daughter he leaves a father, two bro
thers and one sister to mourn his un
timely death.
PROGRESSIVE MEETING
Kansas City, Mo., Aug. 23. A plat
form reaffirming the principles of the
Progressive National Platform of
1912 and 1916 and condemning the
refusal of the majority of the Nation
al Committee of the party to nominate
a candidate for President as a be
trayal of trust and as setting a dan
serous precedent in American poll
tics," was adopted by the. Missouri
State convention of the Progressive
party last night.
Other planks of the platform de
clared for a constitutional convention
to frame a new State Constitution;
use of convict labor on roads, and
laws providing compensation for con
victs thus employed, the money to go
to their dependents; minimum wage
scale for women and girls; workmen's
compensation laws; equal suffrage
legislation and a plank declaring for
prohibition of both manufacture and
sale of intoxicants in Missouri.
Giving as his reason for withdraw
al, an inability to campaign between
now and election time, W. H. Yount
of Macon, Mo., candidate for Gov
ernor on the Prohibition ticket, asked
his party at the State Committe
meeting yesterday to release him
from the honor. Joseph P. Fontron,
gubernatorial candidate of tho Pro
gressive party, was indorsed by
Yount as his successor.
"SNOW BABY" AN AVIATOR
Washington, Aug. 21, Admiral
Robert E. Peary, discoverer of the
NortlTPole. who is intensely interest
ed in aviation as applied to the U. S.
coast defenses, has a rival in that in
terest in his own family.
His daughter, Miss Marie Anighto
Peary, has announced her intention of
studying aernautics. She explains her
plans by saying that she desires to
aid her father in establishing aerial
coast patrol stations along both the
Atlantic and Pacific coasts.
Miss Peary was born in Greenland,
during the time her father was mak
ing his second attempt to reach the
North Pole. She was given the name
"Anighto" an Eskimo word meaning
"Snow Baby" on this account.
Perhaps, her friends assert, Miss
Peary may some day attempt to reach
the North Pole by aeroplane.
FARMINGTON SHOULD
nAVE GOLF LINKS
While Thousands Are Being Dissipated
in Momentary Pleasure, Why Not
Spend a Few Hundred for Up
building, of the Race?
This is pre-eminently an age of su
perfluities. In othsr words, in order
to make our meaning more clear, this
is an age of "follow your leader,"
commonly known as "banter." One
poor "insect" will go his length, and
then make himself believe he is en
joying himself by looking to see who
dares follow. Certainly that is a high
state of existence for the "lords of
creation" to gloat about!
But that, in brief, appears to be
about all the average human being
appears to get out of this life. We
are not now speaking in particular
of the residents of Farmington and
vicinity. We are speaking of the
race in general, according to the writ
er's observation. Such conditions are
not nearly so bad in this particular
community as in many others.
The main thought in our mind, in
writing the above, is the apparent ab
solute frivolity with which so many
human beings swagger through life
with no apparent effort to rise to
those things for which they are evi
dently created. For instance, take the
innumerable army that is now fol
lowing the "auto-bug," apparently ob
livious of the fact that there is any
thing more real in this life for
them than a few brief years of mo
mentary enjoyment, or what appeals
to them as enjoyment.
While thousands of dollars are be
ing practically dissipated in this com
munity annually for "joy-riding",
would it not he a wis;? thing to stop
a moment for a little serious consid
eration as to why we were placed
here, for a few brief years, at most?
Do you not think it was that you
niielit have the opportunity of "work
ing out your own salvation?" Ofj
bringing into living reality those
higher and nobler things of which you
have doubtless dreamed?
In this connection, The Times is go
ing to make a suggestion which, if
followed by any considerable number
in this community, will result in a
very material uplift of the race, in
stead of being constantly on the "to
boggan," as has been the case for the
;w .4i- -al y sircff the rolaps of
the "joy-riding" mania set in. For
The Chautauqua
Is Coming Fine
The Farmington Chautauqua Course
opened Tuesday afternoon with an ex
cellent program given by the Cart
wright Bros. Quartet. The entertain
ment was composed of excellent in
strumental and vocal numbers, which
were greatly enjoyed by all present.
In the evening the Cartwright Bros,
opened the program with another con
cert, being an entire change from the
afternoon performance, which brought
addit ional charm to ths auditors. The
musical program was followed by a
lecture from Morton H. Pemberton,
whoso subject was "Reuben in Rome."
His preliminaries were so extensive
that he had but little time left to talk
of "Rube". But his lecture was very
entertaining and full of humor, and
at its close the audience was still anx
ious to hear more about "Reuben in
Rome."
Wednesday afternoon the "Old
Home Singers" rendered a most en
joyable hour's program, singing the
old songs that are so dear to the
hearts of all. Their rendition of the
old familiar airs was most enjoyable.
They were followed by Thornton A.
Mills, in an educational and eloquent
lecture.
In the evening the "Old Home Sing
ers" again delighted the audience with
charming rendition of old favorite
songs, being in costumes for their
parts. This number was concluded
with a very clever sketch.
Yesterday afternoon's program was
opened by the Schultz-Hill Company
of classia artists, whose violin selec
tions, songs and readings demonstrat
ed that they are true artists. Mat
tison W. Chase filled in the afternoon's
program, and he proved to be a splen
did "filler." Proof was plentiful that
he is really entitled to the designation
of "The Silver Toned Orator" in his
lecture on "Sight and Insight."
The Schulz-Hill Company also op
ened the evening's program, with an
entire change from their afternoon's
performance. Their performance was
a rare treat, especially in this city,
where musical talent is considerably
above par. "The Floyds" were the
closing number on this program, and
'.' was a most enjoyable closing of
mystery, magic, melody and illusion
iry experiments. They could make
the Fakirs of India "set up and take
notice." Hii
The "Grace Callahan" Company",
headed by Grace herself, will open the
-irogram this afternoon. The closing
lumber will be George H. Hodges,
former Governor of Kansas, who, as a
'ecturer, has a well earned reputation
li sustain him. He will bring a "big
message. I
The evening program will again be
ipened by the Grace Callahan Com
nany. Grace Callahan has the repu
tation of being the cleverest lady nov
even a better enjoyment than chasing
the "auto-bug", try a round or two of
the golf links. If that does not make
a "convert" of you, then try another
round and another.
When your real manhood and wo
manhood becomes thus aroused, our
word for it, you will become an enthu
siastic devotee of golf. Then it will
be a very easy matter for you to gave
enough in gasoline billc to say no
thing of the constant expense of up
keep on your auto to pay your part
toward laying out a splendid golf
course, supplying yourself with nec
essary chins, and also, if you choose,
paying for suit, caddie, etc. This real
ly deserving sport will bring you just
what your poor, run-down constitu
tion now stands in such great need of,
through long continued lack of proper
exercise and bodily nourishment.
Then the supreme joy of the game!
It is simply a delightful exercise,
with sufficient zest mixed in to cause
you to absolutely forget any fatigue
that might ensue from a less amount
of exercise taken in another form. It
is just the thing for the outpouring
of the exuberance of youth, at the
same time supplying the exercise
most needed for proper physical de
velopment, and furnishing unbounded
pleasure all the while. For the middle-age,
who have long been running
short of proper physical exercise in
their mad chase for the dollar as
well as pursuing the "auto-bug" a
game or two of golf, every day or two,
is an absolute benediction, and will
slip off the years that have recently
been too rapidly accumulating. For
those who have become old, or prema
turely aged, an occasional trip around
the golf links, with the added stimu
lus of making every stroke tell, is
equal to having the "oil of gladness"
poured into those old, creaky joints,
that have for years been squeaking.
Farmington should have at least
one gotf course which would doubt
less Boon be followed by another
for the good and upbuilding of the
race. Such a course would not only
add to longevity, but would add im
measurably to the real pleasure of
living. A golf chin shc ld be or
ganized di once. Aow mafly will j.iin ?
elty musician in America. O. D. Mc
Keever, who is also supported by a
reputation as being a lecturer of un
usual ability, will "roll the clouds
away" with his "Sunshine Lecture."
On tomorrow, the closing day, the
celebrated "Lohtak and His Band"
will be the chief drawing feature for
both the afternoon and evening pro
grams, with an entire change of pro
gram. In the afternoon the children
who have been attending and partici
pating in the play specialties, under
the Chautauqua play specialist, will
put on a "dress-up" program, for the
purpose of letting parents and friends
see what they have accomplished dur
ing the week.
This year's Chautauqua has now
proceeded sufficiently far to insure its
being a complete success, not only
financially, but also from an education
al and edifying viewpoint. The Times
is of the opinion that the success
which has attended the efforts of a few
this year, in securing the Chautauqua
for Farmington, will hereafter make
success doubly sure, without special
effort on the part of anyone.

"COMBINATION" BEATEN
A picked ball team from Farming
ton and Flat River suffered a terrible
drubbing by the DeSoto team, at the
latter place Sunday afternoon. The
score was 10 to 3 in favor of the home
team. In view of the fact that there
was some ball talent in the combined
team, the conclusion must be that De
Soto is the possessor of "some aggre
gation." The players from Farmington were
Pelty, Priester, Adams and Bragg.
Flat River was represented by the
following players: Sparks, Freeman,
Coffman, Dempsey and Gallager.
Bragg and Sparks were the battery
for the combination team.
U. H.-M. CLUB MEETS
The Unity Home-Makers Club met
at the home of Mrs. Busiek and Mrs.
Schuttler last Thursday. Instead of a
regular program by special invitation
Prof. Busiek gave a splendid address
on "Our Schools." Farm Agent Bert
France was present and by request
made a strong appeal for rural inter
ests. The social hour with neighbors and
friends was a great pleasure, and the
delicious punch and cake served by
the hostesses were enjoyod by all.
