'Headquarters in Salt Lake.
W. J. Hatch and J. H. Doyle, rep
résentatives in Idaho of the Inter.
Mountain Rural Credit association, of
Salt Lake, were placed under arrest
about midnight Saturday night. The
arrests were made by Deputy United
States Marshal C. H. Arbuckle of
Boise, oil a warant issued in that city
by Postoffice Inspector H. E. Bal
larcfc '
The arrested men were kept under
guard the remainder of the night.
Sunday morning they were taken be
fore United States Commissioner Al
fred F. Stone of this city. Hearing
on the complaint was fixed for Thurs
day morning, August 24. Bond was
fixed at $1000.00 for each and was
promptly furnished.
Investigation by Griffiths.
Proseouting Attorney Griffiths has
been investigating Hatch and Doyle
for some time past. Until Saturday
he was unable to get evidence which
warranted him in bringing the matter
to the attention of the postoffice au
thorities. Mr. Griffiths caused the
postoffice authorities to investigate.
The matter has now been turned over
to United States District Attorney J.
L. McClear.
Office Estableshed Here.
Hatoh and Doyle have been working
in this section for some little time.
Only recently they opened offices in
Caldwell. Their city office is located
at 517 Kimball.
It is stated that prosecution of the
men will Le undertaken an the ground
that they have used the mails in "at
tempting to 'obtain money fraudu
lently." There have been no develop
ments to indicate that evidence can
be adduced in effort to prove the
actual taking of money illegally. It is
pointed out that such evidence is not
necessary to convict on the charge
made by the postal authority.
Complaint against the men' is large
ly confined to allegations of misrepre
sentation contained in a letter sent by
them as "assistant general agents" of
the Inter-MountJain Rural Credit as
sociation to one Victor Gardner of
this city. In this letter, it is claimed,
Hatch and Doyle assert that ny pur
chase of stock in their association the
buyer may obtain "a loan of $1500, at
6 per cent interest, for from five to
35 years, prepayable in installments.
Misrepresentation Claimed.
As proof of misrepresentation the
complaint quotes portions of the
Gardner letter in which the accused
men asserted that their association
hi.s obtained a chartcr from the
United States Rural Credit commis
sion in Washington under the new
farm loan law. The prosecuting fed
eral officials will, it is asserted, show
that the farm loan commission has
not yet organized its banks, and has
granted no charters.
In the letter to Gardner the
"agents" claimed that their organ
ization "is now under government
supervision as a federal joint land
bank and practically under the same'
laws as national banks." Then fol
lows this reassuring sentence, "of
course this change now absolutely
gurantees to its members that all
loans will be made as promised."
Old, Old Game Tried Again.
The Tribune is somewhat surprised
thai the attempt should be made Bo
do business in this vicinity on the
plan used by these two men. It has
been only a few months since The
Tribune fully and completely exposed
the Empire Home Company of Boise
which was working a similar game.
The exposure of The Tribune re
sulted in the Empire Home Company
being put out of business by the state
bank examiner. At the time The Tri
bune discussed the plan of these loan
ing companies fully and completely.
There is very little excuse for any
person in this section of the country
investing his money without knowing
exactly what he was doing.
LAW THRESHES 72 BUSHELS
WHEAT TO THE ACRE
J W. Law of Greenleaf has just
threshed his wheat. The wheat ran
72 bushels to the acre on a 35-acre
field. This is the best wheat yield re.
ported this season. Mr. Law is one of
the progressive farmers of the Green
leaf section.
Mr. Law was in the city Thursday
transacting business. He was feeling
very good over his magnificent wheat

ROBERT M. DUNN
JUDGE ROBERT N. DUNN
VISITOR IN CADWELL
North Idaho Jurist is Candidate for
Justice of Supreme Court.
Judge Robert N. Dunn was in
'Caldwell Saturday evening of last
week. Judge Dunn had just come in
from Weiser. He went from Cald
well to Twin/Falls and will then re
turn to his home in north Idaho.
Judge Dunn is a district judge in
the First Judicial District of Idaho
which consists of the northern most
counties of the state. He is a candi
date for Justice of the State Supreme
Court. Judge Dunn is one of the best
known and most popular district
judges in Idaho» He has a great many
friends in this section of Idaho who
hope and believe that he will be one
of the two nominees.
Well Pleased With Outlook.
Judge Dunn stated that he had
covered a considerable portion of
southern Idaho. He has only two
weeks to make a campaign in and will
be unable to visit all sections.
He states that he has been warmly
welcomed in every section he has
visited and is confident that he will be
nominated as one of the two non
partisan candidates for justice. He
was well pleased with the reception in
this part of the state as well as in the
southeast. Judge Dunn has met a
great many of the leading men of
southern Idaho and a great majority
of them have assured him of his nomi
nation.
Judge Dunn is a very able as well as
a very popular man wherever he is
known. It is too bad that his duties
as district judge give him so little
time to get over the state and get ac
quainted. In spite of this his friends
state that he will be one of the nomi
nees.
The three candidates, two of whom
will be nominated at the primary
election are Judge Dunn, Mr. Justice
Sullivan and Mr. John C. Rice of
Caldwell.

ADDISON T. SMITH EX
PLAINS POWER LEAS
ING BILL
REPLY FROM IDAHO CON
GRESSMAN TO WATER USERS
COMMITTEE WHICH CON
DEMNED HIS PROPOSED
WATER POWER LEAS.
ING LAW.
Smith Law Would Give Set'lers Con
trol of Their Power—Friends of
Measure Think Settlers' Committee
Did Nai Understand Provisions—
Bill Is Given in Full That Readers
May Know Exactly What It Pro
vides—Subject Important.
1 he bill of Congressman Addison T.
Smith providing for the leasing ot
water power under government recla
mation projects has provoked a great
deal of discussion. Last week The
1 ribune published an article setting
forth that the committee appointed by
the Boise Water Useds' association
disapproved of the proposed bill.
Thinking the matter of great pub
lic interest we print the proposed law
in full, and also a letter addressed to
the committee by Congressman Smith.
I he letter discussing the proposed bill
follows:
Water Users Must Approve.
1" urther acknowledging receipt of
your telegram with reference to H.
R. 15958, introduced by me, with a
view of benefitting the water users on
government reclamation projects In
the sale of surplus power which may
be available, 1 beg to say that as you
are aware the present law authorizes
the leasing of such surplus power flor
a period of only ten years without the
approval of the Water Users' asso
ciations. I he bill under consideration
provides that these leases may be en
tered into for a period rrot exceeding
fifty years, providing the legally au
thorized Water Users' associations on
the project approve such leases. This
legislation is intended to better pro
tect the rights of the Water Users
associations and t)o bring to the
projects a source of income from the
sale of surplus power which will, it is
hoped, amount to a considerable sum
and thus reduce the cost of water to
the entrymen. It has been Pound that
on many of the projects it is impos
sible to enter into a lease which would
be advantageous to the Water Users
association under the present law per
mitting leases for only ten years.
This is especially true where the ex
penditure of several thousand dollars
wiould be involved in the construction
of power plants. If this law is reot
enacted it will probably result in a
great quantity' of surplus power on
reclamation projects going to waste
which should be utilized, not only to
enable the reclamation of additional
lands, but also to bring an income to
the settlers under the project. Under
the proposed law Water Users' asso
ciions have absolute control of the
matter, inasmuch as their approval
must be secured be6ore contracts can
be entered into by the Secretary of
the Interior, for the leasing of surplus
power. If you have any suggestions
to offer in view of the above explana
tion as to the object tlo be accomp
lished by proposed legislation, please
let me hear from you."
Proposed Law.
The bill introduced by Congressman
Smith is as follows:
Be it enacted by the Senate and
House of Representatives of the
United States of America in congress
assembled, That section five of an act
entitled An act providing for the
withdrawal from public entry of lands
needed for townsite purposes in con
nection with irrigation projects under
the reclamation act of June seven
teenth, nineteen hundred and two. and
for other purposes," approved April
sixteenth, nineteen hundred and six,
as amended by the act of February
twenty-fourth, nineteen hundred and
eleven, entitled "An' act Oo amend an
acst entitled 'An act providing for the
withdrawal from public entry of lands
needed for townsite purposes in con
nection with irrigation projects under
the reclamation act of June 17, 1902,
a/nd for other purposes,' approved
April 16, 1906," be amended to read
as follows:
"Sec. 5. That whenever a develop
ment of power is necessary for the ir
rigation of lands, under any prtoject
undertaken under the reclamation law.
or any opportunity is afforded for the
development of power under any such
project, the Secretary of the Interior,
with the approval of the legally or
ganized arid acting water users' as
sociation, or associations, under any
such project, is authorized to lease for
a period not exceeding fifty years,
giving preference to municipal pur
poses and to irrigation districts duly
organized under state law, any surplus
power or power privilege, and the
money derived from such leases shall
be converted into the reclamation fund
and be placed to the credit of the
project whim which said power is de
rived: Provided, That rto Tease shall
be made for such surplus power or
power privilege as will impair the
efficiency of the irrigation project.

bezzlement of $587.50, the amount o! a
check given by the Smeed Bros., in
payment of their 1915 faxes on 3i'0

day morning to prepare and present
the bond, which, he stated, would be
given by two personal friends.
When attention of Judge Stovel was
later called to the fact that September

that a change of date would undoubt
edly be made to correct the over
sight.
Action against the deposed officer
is brought by County Attorney H. A.
Griffiths, representing the state of
Idaho, under subdivision 10 of sec
tion 6875 of the revised codes of Ida
ho. "Misuse of public moneys by an
officer" as therein defined is a clas
sification of embezzlement. The pen
alty affixed is from 1 to 14 years', im
prisonement.
Felony Is Alleged.
The complaint upon which the war
rant for the arrest was based contains
this language:
"That A. O. Christopher, then and
there being, on or about the first Mon
day of July, 1916, in the county of
Canyon, state of Idaho, and on divers
dates and days prior thereto, and con
tinuing up to the 21st day of August,
1916, while then and there being duly
elected county assessor of Canyon
county, state of Idaho, during'the pe
riod herein mentioned, did then and
there knowingly, designedly, willfully,
unlawfully, fraudulently and feloni
ously, and with a fraudulent intent,
omit and refuse to pay over to the
county treasurer of Canyon county,
state of Idaho, or to any person or
officer authorized by law to receive
the same, certain moneys and funds
received by him under a duty imposed
by law so to pay over said money and
funds to the county treasurer of Can
yon county, state of Idaho, then and
there entrusted to him and given into
hisv .control by virtue of his office as
county assessor of/ Canyon county,
state of Idaho, by the taxpayers of
said Canyon county.
Large Amount Involved.
"The amount which the said A, O.
Christopher so knowingly, designedly,
willfully, unlawfully, fraudulently and
feloniously omitted and refused to pay
over was then and there the sum of
ten thousand three hundred and thir
ty-three and fifty-two hundreds dol
'ars ($10,333.52) lawful money of the
United States of America, and being
then and there the money and funds
of the said Canyon county.
It is believed that simultaneously
with the issuance of the .complaint and
warrant in this criminal action, the
county authorities made demand upon
the company in which Christopher
"•as bonded for the amount now
i-laimed as due from him. Definite
verification of this action was lacking
Tuesday evening.

On Tuesday afternoon, August 29,
at 3 o'clock, there will be a joint meet
ing of all the Parent-Teachers Circles
of Caldwell. This will be held at the

ant business is to be transacted. Plans
for the year's work will be discussed.
JOHN C. RICK
FISK AND GOWEN MEET
V/ITH HEARTY RECEPTION
Visit Southeast and Are Well Pleased
With Political Outlook.
Messrs. F. E. Fisk of Parma, can
didate for state treasurer, and J. B.
Gowen of Caldwell, returned from
the southeast Saturday. They visited
14 counties in the southern part of the
state and ;)re well pleased'with the
outlook as they found it. Mr. Go wen
stated that the candidacy of Mr. Fisk
is looked upon with favor in all the
southern counties. He predicts that
Mr. l'isk will be the Republican nomi
nee this year.
Change Demanded in Capitol.
Monday Mr. Gowen said to a repre
sentative of The Tribune:
"We visited 14 counties in southern
Idaho and talked with hundreds of
people. We found Fisk sentiment in
every county. I am convinced that
Mr. Fisk will be the Republican can
didate for state treasurer. There is a
well defined sentiment in every sec
tion that changes should be made in
the state house. Many people go so
far as to say there shlould be a clean
sweep from top to bottom.
"Yes, that includes Alexander,"
continued Mr. Gowen. "Governor
Alexander is not as strong as he was
two years ago. The people are tiring
of his buncombe and he will fall short
of his vote two years ago by 20,000
or better. Ile has not a ghost of a
show."
Mr. Gowen did not care to discuss
Republican candidates other than Mr.
Fisk. He states that he found senti
ment for the different Republican can
didates i,n different sections. Lieuten
ant Governor Taylor is the stronger
north Idaho man in Mr. Gowen's
judgment in the southeast.
Republican Victory.
Mr. Gowpn is convinced that there
will be a Republican victory in Idaho
this fall. "A good clean Republican
ticket will sweep the state," said Mr.
Gowen. "Nominee Hughes' speeches
are creating a profound impression
and will unquestionably strengthen
the Republican party in all these west
ern states."
Candidate for Senator.
Mr. Gowen is a candidate for the
Republican nomination for state sena
tor. He stated that he had votes in
every one of the 14 counties, and if he
could gather them all together would
be nominated with a whojap.
Mr. Gowen will spend some little
time here at home looking after the
local situation. He seems to feel con
fident of his own nomination, and will
give his campaign some little atten
tion from now on.
KRESS' GRAIN CROP RAN
OVER 52 BUSHELS TO ACRE
Well Known Dixie Farmer Will
Erec: New Residence This Fall.
The oats and barley crop of Mr.
Fred Kress turned out fine. When
Mr. Kress finished threshing his 47
:icre field of grain he found he had
2487 bushels which make a little over
52 bushels to the acre. The wheat
has not been threshed yet, but it
looks as though it will run as well as
the oats and barley.
Mr. Kress was in the city Saturday
for the purpose of making arrange
ments f r the drilling of an artesian
well. Work was started on the well
'his week by Mr. Ed Botkin.
Mr. Krss will erect a fine new resi
dence this fall. He is now making
the preparations to let the contract
and start work. He states that crops
generally are turning out fine in the
Dixie section and the farmers will
make a great many improvements • n
their places this fall. Mr. Kress is
one of the most up-to-date and pro
gressive farmers in this section of the
country.
Feturn From Portland.
Mr. and Mrs. O. M. Van Duyn re
turned from the coast Friday last.
They went both ways by automobile.
They met with no mishaps and had a
most pleasant trip and outing.
Mr. Van Duyn stated that while he
enjoyed himself immensely he was
very glad to get back to Idaho. His
trip overland gave him a sight of
much of the Oregon country. He is
more convinced tfein ever that Idaho
is the greatest of these western states.
Dr. F. M. Cole and Messrs. C. E.
Emory, C. J. Wescott and J. H. Harris
were at Arrowrock Sunday. The
fishing there is not very good.
NORTH IDAHO IS TAKING
VERÏ EASY
, HOLT IS DEVELOPING GREAT
STRENGTH IN NORTH IDA
HO AND WILL RECEIVE
HANDSOME MAJORITY
IN THAT SECTION
OF STATE.
P. ople Generally Are Too Busy to
Ir >tedest Themselves in Politics and
the Primary Election—North Idaho
Is Prosperous and Busy—Mines,
Milis and Farms are All Making
Mcney—Greates; Activity in His
tory of That Section Is Now on.
(Special to Tribune.)
Wallace, Idaho—With the primary
election but 10 days in the offing
the people of north Idaho are evidenc
ing as much interest and concern in
the momentous event as they would
it suddenly informed that little Jonny
Jones of Ishkafiet, Wisconsin, had
barked his little shin. They are too
busy gaming the golden harvest and
devising ways and means of distri
buting the surplus inclement to bother
over the trifling detail of saving the
state from the predatory plûtes, who
an eminent authority of the panhandle
declares have organized to loot the
state from the handle to the pan.
In sections where local people aspire
for state office considerable interest is
being taken. At Lewiston, the home
of two candidates on the Republican
ticket, George E. Crum for governor
and Miss Ethel Redfield for superin
tendent of public instruction, interest
is keen and a heavy vote will be cast
Crum supporters have formed a non
partisan organization with a member
ship of 2000, confined largely to the
Camas and Lewiston sections. A
strenuous effort will be made to poll
the full Republican strength of the
district at the primary. Crum mana
gers declaring that 95 per cent of the
vo * ers are Crum supporters.
throughout the north Miss Ethel
Redfield, candidate for superintendent
of public instruction is extremely
popular, and close political observers
predict that she will leave the north
with a large majority. Miss Redfield
has served two terms as county super
intendent of Nez Perce county, during
which time she has demonstrated
executive ability of a high order and a
through grasp of educational af
fairs.
The charge made in certain sections
of the state that Miss Redfield is a
"hand picked" candidate has served to
solidify her support, and will act as a
boomerang, assert her friends who
keenly resent the implication the
charge carried.
The fight being waged in the south
against the renomination of George R.
Barker is not taken seriously in the
north. The belief is general ïhat the
attack is designed to satisfy personal
grudges and that the voters will pay
but little attention to it on election
day. Barker will poll a larger vote
in the north than his two opponents
combined in the opinion of northern
leaders.
While central Idaho is practically
solid for Crum the northern tier of
counties will give Herman Taylor, the
Sandpoint candidate, a heavy vote.
Which will carry the north is problem
atical. An impersonal view gives Crum
a pre-election advantage; his forces
are well organized and enthusiastic
.md he has waged an aggressive cam
paign.
Of the southern candidates for state
office, B. M. Holt of Caldwell for lieu
tenant governor, and F. E. Fisk of
Parma for state treasurer, are the
most popular and both will poll a
heavy vote.
The nomination of Mr. Holt in par
ticular will add strength to the state
ticket in the estimation of northern
Republicans. His record as a success
ful business man and his consistent
policy of developing the farming sec.
tions of the south are well known and
Republicans generally express grati
fied surprise over his acceptance. It is
recognized that if the Republican
party is to be successful this fall the
state ticket must be composed of men
for whom no apoligies or explanations
must be made. Mr. Holt's freedom
from entangling affiliations will be an
element of great strength to the entire
ticket, it is declared.
MISS AGNES BICKNELL AND
MR. W. C. GOWEN MARRIED
Miss Agnes Louise Bicknell and Mr.
W. C. Gowen were married at the
home of the bride's parents Monday
