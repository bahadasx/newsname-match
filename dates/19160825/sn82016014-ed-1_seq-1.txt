HOW TO PLEASE THE PUBLIC!
Problem of 8-Hour Day and
Higher Freight Rates.
Situation Is Less Promising
Says One Official.
Washington. Aug. 2 5. With Presi
dent Wilson and the railway presi
dents apparently hopelessly at looser
heads in their efforts to prevent the
threatened strike, the president today
stirred up excitement by suddenly call
' ing the he ids of the railroad brother
hoods to the White House. Th con
ference with the brotherhoods lasted
an hour and a half, adjourning just
at noon. According to the workers'
representatives, however, it left the
situation UBChanged.
They were asked to accept no com
promise, the brotherhood chiefs said,
and save the impression as they left
the White House that the president
miKht be expected to stand firmly by
the proposal which they have accept
ed, but which the railway presidents
refuse. The brotherhood men, while
at the White House, placed bef ire the
president the charge that a nation
wide lobby is being conducted to influ
ence sentiment in favor of the rail
roads. Thev presented telegrams to
show that the Northern Pacific is pay
ing for favorable messages forwarded
to Washington. The following mes
sage, the brotherhood heads said, was
sent bv Supt. J. L. Devorce of the
Northern Pacific to all agents of nis
roud :
A Telegram Propaganda.
'It is highly important to get train
men question discussed by farmers,
stock raisers, dairymen and mercants.
pease get as many of these classes as
possible in your town and vicinity to
sent telegrams rush to President
Wilson at Washington, urgently re
questing him to settle the controversy
bv arbitration. Telegrams should show
business of the sender. These tele
grams are to be paid from station
funds and statements sent me for
voucher, your credit.
"I want you to send copies of these
telegrams to me by wire as soon as
transmitted to the president, using our
own wires for this. Might be well to
have some of the most prominent
Hingers send messages to their con
gressmen and senators in Washington
in addition to those sent to President
Wilson. This is very important and
must be given preference over normal
business today."
Pressure on Kniploycs.
The pressure from their members
for prompt disposal of the issue with
tile railroads is becoming strong, the
brotherhood men told the president.
W. J. Lee. president of the Trainmen's
union, showed the following telegram
1mm brotherhood members at White
J ish. Mont.:
"National conference committee of
liiiinagers requesting business of Unit
ed Stales, wire President Wilson in
sist ins that he change attitude regard
i!:x eihl-hcur controversy and insist
J' riUitration. Brotherhood members.
White Fish, insist action be taken to
tiispo.se of this controversy or force is-fiti-
as authorized by strike. Refuse
arbitration proposition for eight-hour
on y."
The brotherhood men denied spe
cifically that they had been asked by
the president to consider possible leg
islation by the present congress.
"The situation is just rocking
along." said A H. Garretson. "There
will be no compromise."
Washington, Aug. 25. The leaders
of the four rai.road brotherhoods have
an appointment with the president at
:i:3l) today, it was announced after a
Visit to the White House by W. L.
Chambers of the federal mediation
word.
Washington, Aug. 23. President
Wilson today, after a conference with
Vice Presiaent Marshall, sent worl to
'he railway executives that he would
like to see them some time during the
day. No indication of what the presi
dent has :n mind was given.
The several million dollars' ,vo-th
of railway presidents who have been
working he.e for several days to pic
vent the threatened nation-wide rail
load strike, resumed their struggle
today wit more desperation than
hope shown in the attitude of many
of them.
"The situation is less promising than
at any time since negotiations start
ed, said one of the most important
railway heads.
How About Iublic?
Discom gement today grows out of
this problem: How to grant an eight
hour day and make the public liter
ally pay the freight.
The railroad heads want assurance
o a binding character that the
creased cost of operating their lines
will be met by increased revenues. The
best they have been able to get is Pres
ident U ilson's agreement to d) "all
that is possible" in case thoro investi
gatiot. sho-vs after the eight hour 3ay

roads are in need of relief. Years of

SHAME ON SUSIE!
Movie Actress Rocked the Boat
at Topeka Theater.
Sow Manager Must Appear Be
fore Local Court.
CENSOR TURNS DOWN PICTURE
Jesse Elliott of Best Is Alleged
to Hare Shown It.
ow What in the World Did
aughty Susan Do!
Because ''Susan Rocked the Boat" in
Topeka after the censor board and
the appeal board the last word in
the local movie world had said she
snouldn't, a warrant was issued from
the court of Topeka today for Jense
Elliott, manager of the Best theater.
Susan must be "some" girl to rock
a boat in such shocking style as to
bring down the condemnation of both
the censor board and the appeal board.
The complaint does not throw any
light on Susan's character or reputa
tion but it must be bad. Nor does it
mention the kind of a boat she rocked,
nor how she rocked it. It doesn't say
whether it was merely a flimsy little
canoe, a yacht, a matrimonial ship or
a ship of state, it doesn't say wheth
er she was in the boat when the crime
was committed or whether she stood
on the bank and threw stones at it.
Their Feet Down o It.
But whatever kind of boat it was
and whatever method Susan followed,
Susan rocked it and a lot of innocent
Topeka people saw her do it after two
state t commissions, weighted down
with authority, had put their respect
ive feet down upon it.
The complaint was sworn to by W.
S. Scneder. It charges that Jesse El
liott as manager of the Best theater
exhibited a "Triangle" film entitled.
"Susan Rocks the Boat," unapproved
by V. D. Ross, state superintendent of
education. Mr. Scneder stated to the
county attorney that the film had been
turned down by the censor board and
then by the appeal board before El
liott produced it at the Best. '
Arrangements were made for the
issuance of a warrant Monday by Fes
tus Foster, member of the beard of
censors, but for some reason it was
held up later until after the convention
of moving picture exhibitors had
closed.
CUT PAPER COST
Tat to Prevent Exorbitant
Price Proposed in Senate.
Senator Hitchcock Introduces
Amendment to Revenue Bill.
Washin gton, Aug. 2 5. Senator
Hitchcock, Democrat, has prepared
an amendment to the revenue bill in
tended to check the soaring prices of
news print paper. He said today he
would bring it up in the senate when
certain sections of the bill were
leached for debate. Mr. Hitchcock is,
himself, a newspaper owner.
Paper selling at $40 a ton and un
der would not be taxed. When the
price passed $40 a ton a tax of $1 a
ton would prevail until $45 a ton is
reached, when the tax would increase
to $3 and mount up gradually until
a tax of $40 a ton would prevail on
paper selling for more than $90.
"Any proposed amendment is de
signed not so much to raise revenue,"
said Mr. Hitchcock, "as it is to make
it unprofitable for paper manufactur
ers to charge exorbitant prices for
newsprint paper.
"The price of newsprint paper has
been very stable for several years, un
til recently selling around 2 cents a
pound at the mills. There has been
an increase in the consumption of pa
per in the last two years for two rea
sons. First the great increase in cir
culation arising from the war and re
cently the greater volume of adver
tising due to prosperity. The result is
that all surplus stock of naper has
practically disappeared.
"Manufatlurers whose product is
not fully contracted for are taking ad
vantage of the situation. While the
great buk of newsprint paper is sell
ing at 2 cents a. pound under existing
contracts, all new sales are bringing
from 4 to 5 cents a pound."

NEW RACE COMING
Western Plains To Be Inhab
ited by "Supermen."
Their Souls Transmigrated
From Fallen Soldiers.
St. Louis, Mo., Aug. 25.-. Practically
all the delegates to the national con
vention of American Theosophists here
today agreed with Albert H. Warring
ton, president of the association, that
a race of "supermen" is coming'.
The "supermen" will be the product
of the great American melting pot,
and the plains of the western United
States and Australia, according to
Warrington. The "effete east," be
cause of its ignorance of the largeness
of the rest of the United States, will
have no part in the production of the
new race. Warrington placed the
"effete east" in that part of the coun
try "Just east of the Alleghenies."
"The new race of 'supermen' will
play 'hunches' on all great decisions,"
said Warrington. "Thtir religion will
be the brotherhood of men. They will
have the transmigrated souls of the
soldiers killed in the European war
the purest of souls, because they are
those of men who unselfishly gave
their lives for an ideal. A great re
ligious teacher of the type of Christ
will lead the new race- This new
leader will bo produced in India im
mediately after the European war and
will spend his time in the United
States and Australia," Warrington
said.

HOW ABOUT BEES?
Farmer Tried to Burn Bumble
Bees Out of Hay.
Fire Spread Out Over Four
Neighboring Farms.
150 PEOPLE OUT TO FIGHT IT
Not Until Nine Stacks Were
Burned Was It Out.
But No One Knows What Be
came of Bumble Bees.
While trying to burn out a nest of
bumblebees in a hay stack, Frank
Kcehler, a farmer living between Te
cumseh and Watson, set fire to the
stack, burned it and nine others and
started a fire that ran over four
neighboring farms. One hundred and
fifty people were out in the fields
fighting it late yesterday afternoon
and finally brought it under control.
The farm upon which Kothler lives
belongs to John Kngelke. The bum
blebees had been bothering Koehler
and his stock and yesterday was the
day set for a settlement. The fire
used in the nest caught in the stack
and in halI mmute was bev0nd con
.
way into the dry grass and other with
ered vegetation. Help came but the
wind defeated all efforts to control the
fire until parts of four farms had been
burned over.
The man who brought the informa
tion to Topeka neglected to find out
before he left the farm whether Mr.
Koehler exceeded in killing all the
bees.

Girl Tells Story When White
Slaver Married.
Stenographer by Day and a
Street Walker at Sight.
New York, Aug. 25. In the same
little wicker satchel in which she once
carried her books and lunch to the
Irving high school, Caroline Kauf
man, pretty white" slave victim today
carried to the office of Assistant T dis
trict Attorney James Smith tetters,
telegrams and pictures which will
serve as additional evidence against
Gustav Kuelman, alleged white slav
er, and others, in a ring said by offi
cers in the district attorney's office to
be the largest in the city. With tears
in her eyes because she had lost her
position as a result of the publicity
which had been given to her experi
ences as a white slave, Miss Kaufman
came to the district attorney's office.
At the same hour Gustav Kugelman
was arraigned in the court of gen
eral sessions and in default of 10. too
bail was locked up in the Tombs.
In court today Attorney Smith de
scribed the case as the most heart
rending he had ever had anything to
do with since he had held the pres
ent position.
Included among tne letters ana ieie-

anj a fine physique. In telling her
story, she appeared calm and never
used a coarse word or a slang expres
sion. Told Rich Father Story.
Altho reluctant to tell her story,
Miss Kaufman commented at the
opening that even now she did not see
' "the wrong of this life."
I Attorney Smith explained to her
! that her testimony will result in the
prosecution of Kugelman.
Miss Kaufman then told how she
met Kugelman thru a girl friend.
The leve making that followed did not
pass the bounds of propriety for more
than a year. Miss Kaufman paid. She
became deeply in love with Kugelman
and believed his story that he would
warry her as soon as the rich father
he told her about died. In Novem
ber, 1914. Miss Kaufman began to live
with Kugelman as his wife and then
she learned that there was r.othing in
the "rich father" story and that Ku
Eerman had been married in Atlanta.
Kugelman begged forgiveness ;md
added that he needed money. She
gave him the $10 she made each week
as a stenographer but he said he need
ed more. She refused at first to con
sider his method of getting more

Popular Sentiment in Greece

Concentrates Large Force;
Diplomats Seek Permission.
London. Aug. 25. Germany has or
dered the Bulgarians to discontinue
their advance into Greece and to
evacuate occupied Greek territory, fear
ing Greece will be drawn into the war.
according to an unconfirmed wireless
dispatch from Rome today.
Several Greek generals have refused
to obey orders to evacuate Eastern
Macedonia before the Bulgarian ad
vance, the dispatch said. Instead of re
tiring they have prepared to defend
the Eastern Macedonia front. The
Greek government is said to have laid
this information before Germany, add
ing that public indignation over the
invasions has increased to such an ex
tent that the government is no longer
master of the situation. Upon receipt
of this Information Germany ordered
the Bulgarian withdrawal, it was
stated.
30 Miles Into Greece.
The Rome report, thus far. is not
confirmed from any other source, tho
it is a fact that only in Eastern Mace
donia have the Bulgars continued their
advance in the past forty-eight 'hours-
After advancing nearly thirty mileit
into Greek territory and occupying
Kastoria. the Bulgarian right wing
made no further progress. Official
dispatches apparently contradict the
Rome report, stating the Greeks are
evacuating the region around the city
of Seres, under orders from the Greek
government.
Budapest dispatches, reporting th
concentration of large bodies of Rus
sian troops on the Bessarabian-Ru-manian
frontier, evidently with th
purpose of crossing Rumania to in
vade Bulgaria and Hungary, aroused
Intense interest today.
Rumania War .Sentiment Grows.
The Budapest newsDaper,Al JEt,
was quoted as declaring' that the Ru
manian war party is becoming strong
er and that the Rumanian government
has made tentative preparations at the
frontier, making is easy for the Ru
manian forces to co-operate with the
Russians if Rumania is drawn into
the war.
Recent dispatches from Berlin as
sorted that Russian diplomats are
bending their energies at present, not
to obtaining Rumania's part in the
war. but to obtaining permission for
Russian troops to cross Rumania to
attack Bulgaria and Hungary.
