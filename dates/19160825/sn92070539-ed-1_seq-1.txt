J. R. Blair, J. A. Moore and
. E. Parks while in Deming last
Saturday, made a visit to Camp
Deming. There is something
near 2,000 men of the National
Guard stationed there. The
ground is low ami muddy, but
the boys were making ditches
and draining the site. The
people of Deming take a a great
pride in the camp and speak well
of tho soldier boys. W. E. Holt,
the popular editor of the Deming
Graphic, escorted us over the
camp and introduced us to a
number of officers and men.
The government has leased a
large tract of land, and evidently
expect to keep the soldiers in
Deming for a long time. One
tract of 1G0 acres leased costs
Uncle Sam $100 per month. Tho
camp is located a short distance
northwest of town, just outside
the city limits.
