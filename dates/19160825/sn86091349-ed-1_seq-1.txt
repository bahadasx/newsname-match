UNIVERSITY OK NEVADA
News was received in Carson
City Sunday of the finding of the
body of F. Thomas Hamill, vice prin
cipal of the Carson City high school,
which was discovered Thursday with
the head horribly crushed, lying
about 200 feet from his cabin on his
homestead, which is about 4 5 miles
south of Twin Falls, Idaho. He had
evidently been dead for two or three
days and had been killed by a blow
on the head. He was last seen by
neighbors Monday evening three
miles from his home.
Prof. Hamill was married last De
cember to Miss Jessie Mitchell at the
home of her parents at Oakes, S. D.,
and had intended to return to Car
sun City about September 4th to be
ready to take up his school deities.

is being carried out by the stockmen
of the state and the university. In
order to improve the breed of live
stock in the state, the Nevada Cattle
men's association has made provision
to add blooded stock to the univer
sity herd. The stock will be bred
and in turn the ranchers will use the
high bred stock to improve the value
of their herds. At the present time
the university has one of the best
collections of high-bred stock in the
United States for its size and it will
be added to constantly by the stocK

BAD MEXICAN PRISONER
REFUSES TO "CASH IN"
High wind moved a box car from
the side track on the main line at
Elko last Saturday, setting the auto
matic electric block system. The en
gineer of passenger train No. 19, rap
idly approaching Elko, observed the
signal two miles out of town and sip
ped, sending forward the flagman to
ascertain the cause of the trouble.
The boxcar was switched back on the
side track and the passenger train
proceeded on its way. . The perfec

presence of something on the track,
prevented what may possibly have
been a bad railroad wreck.

A schedule of lands and other in
formation in regard to the sale may
be obtained upon inquiry of the Reg
ister and Receiver of the U. S. Land

WELL KNOWN MAN
DIES IX DENVER
The man LeBaron, who was shot
the other day while trying to escape
from the prison, seems inclined to
fool everybody. It was thought at
first that his wound was fatal, but
yesterday he was able to eat, smoke
Cigarettes, and put on his clotlies. It
is almost universally considered a
misfortune in Carson that he will re
cover, for he is a very dangerous
man, and it is feared that he may
live to kill someone else before he
gives another occasion to be shot.

Yesterday at the instance of the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Dis
trict Attorney Woodburn brought
suit in the United States district
court against twelve defendants on
the Pyramid lake Indian reservation
to oust them from lands within the
reservation, says the Carson Newt.
The suits involve the ownership of
approximately 1,000 acres of land
some of which has been occupied by
the defendants since 18S6. The de
fendants are alleged to be within the
Jines of a United States reservation
and to be trespassing. Though they
have enjoyed possession of the land
for many years, have made improve
ments, and have tilled it from year
to year, the claim is made that they
have never had any right to be there,
and the complaint asks that they be
made to surrender the property to
the Indians.

The following article will doubt

as we understand he was well known
locally:
Willis D. Prewitt, who died at
Denver, Colo., July 19, 1916, was
born in Paris, Mo., in 1869, where he
resided' for 21 years and " then came
west and taught school 13 years. It
was while he was teaching that he
was united in marriage to Miss Lil
lian Campbell, daughter of Colonel
Campbell of Missouri. To this union
three children were born. Two sons
and one daughter. One son died a
few years ago.
Mr. Prewitt was a member of
Henry M. Teller Lodge No. 144, A.
F. & A. M., of Modern .Woodmen,
and an officer and prominent member
of Highland Christian church. Those
left to mourn his sudden departure
are the widow, a daughter, Juanita,
13 years of age, a son, Wendell D.,

A recommendation from General
Funston that the American troops be
withdrawn from Mexico was con
tained in a recent report on the mil
itary situation made at the request
of the war department and designed
for use of the joint commission
which will discuss border problems.
State department officials do not at
tempt to disguise their regret over
premature publication of General
Funston's conclusions, but they indi
cated today that it would not cause
any alteration in plans.
Officials realize, it is understood,
that the most pressing matter for dis
cussion by the commission, from the
Mexican viewpoint, will be the ques
tion of withdrawal of Pershing's ex
peditionary force. In order to fur
nish the American commissioners
with full information, General Fun
ston was asked to express his views
on the military aspects of the expe
dition.
There is every indication that the
commissioners, and later, the admin
istration, were expected to abide by
the recommendations of the chief
military advisor on border matters.
Publication of the fact that Gen
eral Funston believes it wise to with
draw the troops may hamper the
American commissioners, some offi
cials think, in obtaining whatever
guarantees they may ask of the Mex
lean government as to security of
the border from bandit raids. It is
believed the administration is fully
prepared to arrange for the recall of
General Pershing's force, since both
state and war department officials
are understood to share the views ex
pressed in General Funston's report
There can be but little doubt, it ia
I now said, that the withdrawal will be
