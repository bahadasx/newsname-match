EAST JORDAN. MICHIGAN, FRIDAY. AUGUST 25, 1916.
No. 35
Schools Open
September 4th.
Excellent Corps of Teachers En
gaged for the Coming Year.
The public schools will begin the an
nual term on Monday, September 4th.
All of the school buildings are being
renovated and put in good condition
for the return of the pupils and teach
ers. A large enrollment is expected in
all grades, especially in the high school
which has accomodations for 215 pupils
Although four of the faculty of the
high school of last year do not
, return,- the teachers selected to fill
these positions are exceptionally
well qualified for the work. Three of
them have degrees from colleges and
made excellent records in school.
Parents of high school students are
urged to assist their children in the
selection of a course of study. Certain
subjects are required of all but those
which are elective should be chosen
with considerable care. Aside from the
regular work students may also take
agriculture, sewing, bookkeeping,
shorthand or manual training. Those
vio want a copy of the course of study
o'lhe high school may secure the same
b$" writing or telephoning to Supt.
iiolliday. v
There are a number of students from
the country who desire to work for
their board and cannot attend school
unless they can do so. Persons who
can use such students, either girls or
boys, will confer a favor by notifying
Supt. Iiolliday as soon as possible. At
any time during the school year stu
dents may be obtained for odd jobs by
telephoning to the high school building.
Following the plan that was begun
last year, the seventh and eighth grades
will be a part of the high school and
only the first six grades will be ac
comodated at the Jordan River and
West Side schools.
Children entering the high school
from rural school districts should have
county eighth grade diplomas. Others
will be admitted only in special cases
and such students must pay their own
tuition in advance. Every eighth grade
graduate within reach of this high
school should plan to enter the ninth
grade this term. The entire high school
course is planned to be of actual prac
tical benefit for all students and the
special work now offered in sewing,
agriculture and manual training should
appeal to those young people who are
looking for more practical training than
books afford. The high school faculty
is as well qualified as any the school
has ever had and every member has
had at least six weeks of special train
ing within the past year.
The following corps of teachers has
been engaged for the year:

TION Senator Stone was entirely within
his rights in criticising the "leak" of
the Danish treaty--but he enumerated
with care all the agencies through
which the "leak" might have occurred,
and every one of then happens to be
Democratic. It is evident that the
Democrats can hold nothing but office
and they won't hold even that for any
length of time.

THE NATIONAL GUARD
HAS PROVEN irS WORTH
Lansing, Mich., August 21. "The
calling of the National Guard to the
border has proven its worth. It is my
belief they will never be. supplanted as
an offensive and defensive force by
any other agency. They fill a definite
place in our military plan. No other
Ltroops, regular or volunteer, can sup
plant them in usefulness and public
confidence.
The above statement was made by
Albert E. Sleeper, of Bad Axe, during
a recent visit to Lansing. Sleeper,
who is a candidate for the republican
nomination for governor, expressed re
gret that he had not the opportunity to
become more intimately acquainted
with the Guard, and continued:
'I am aware that the Guard has cri
tics and enemies who are claiming that
they have failed to meet the test. I
cannot see it so, judging by stories in
the newspapers and by the men them
selves. More than 100,000 responded
within a very short time after the call
of June 18th. Michigan gave almost
twice the number of men on her origi.
nal roster. The citizen-soldiers every
where came so fast that the govern
ment was unable to supply them with
rifles, uniforms and blankets.
In fact, the government could not
supply surgeons to examine them,
mustering officers to muster them, or
sleeping-cars to take them south.
Nothing wrong with the system that
can gum up a supposedly well prepar
ed war department with an oversupply
of men like that.
It is the duty now of this and every
other state to defend the Guard from
any plan to abandon it for a huge regu
lar army. Let the army cease its efforts
to 'reform the Guard out of existence
and look to its own efficiency, which is
somewhat short of 100 per cent.
"I wish the Guard might be relieved
of strike duty. It should be no part' of
their work to perform such service,
which cannot help but be disagreeable
and unsympathetic. I hope that in the
near future something can be done to
handle possible strike disorders by
some other means than with the Guard.
ALONG THE FIRING LINE
"Pitiless publicity" is not to rule the
Civil Service Commission. That board
has refused to let the Civil Service
Reform League have access to the
records of the so-called examinations
whereby thousands of fourth-class
postoffices were transferred from Re
publican hands. And the President
has backed the Commission up in its
refusal-probably because it was based
on the ground that the facts disclosed
might be used to embarrass the adminis
tration, as they undoubtedly would.
Some of our editorial colleagues ex
press surprise that Mr. Hughes suc
ceeded, so early in his campaign, in
putting the Wilson administration on
the defensive. To us it would have
been more surprising if he had not
done so. The fact is that the adminis
tration is extremely vulnerable. Its
record is replete with broken promises,
with examples of bad faith, with evi
dence of intellectual and political in-stability-to
say the least-and with con
stantly recurring proofs of inefficiency.
This record is being set forth by Mr.
Hughes with remarkably explicit force
-and the administration must, perforce,
defend itself, though weakly.
Henry Morgenthau, who was the
chief financier of the last Democratic
campaign and who went as ambassador
to Turkey, as a consequence, estimates
that the Democrats will need 50 per
cent more campaign money this year
than they had four years ago. The
estimate is far too low. They will need
500 per cent more. Four years ago the
party had no record to defend, and now
it has. In 1912 there was a divided Re
publican party and now there is a re
united Republican party. Four years
ago Woodrow Wilson had a great
reputation as a teacher and author. He
had no reputation as a statesman.
Now he has a reputation as a spoils
man, a weakling, a vacillator, and a
trimmer. A party with that sort of a
candidate needs more funds than it can
possibly get, even if it gets all it wants.
Democratic newspapers in Richmond
Virginia, are boasting in their news
columns that a large portion of the re
cent order received by the American
Locomotive Company for shells for the
allies will be filled at the Richmond
plant of the Company, thus giving em
ployment for about 4000 men. And
yet, in the editorial columns, those
same.papers endeav6r to make their
readers believe that war orders have
nothing to do with our present business
activity. Richmond has long been a
direct beneficiary of ammunition pro
duction at Hopewell, near by, and the
people of the state are not deceived as
to the nature of the business they are
getting. .
County Fair
Sept. 5-6-7-8
Attractions and Exhibits Will Be
the Best in Its History.
Your attention is called to the Char
levoix County Fair to be held at East
Jordan, Sept. 5 G 7 and 8. This Fair is
an annual event and is this year to be
on a larger scale than ever before.
The management has 'provided an
unusually good list of Free Attractions,
among them being two aeroplane
flights daily, by an aviator provided by
the O. E. Williams Aeroplane Company.
Flights are assured each day, the Aero
plane Company's contract being a "No
Flight No .Pay" one.
The horse races are expected to be
fast and interesting as all the old race
horses will be there and a good many
new entries are being received.
Entries are being received daily and
there is every indication that exhibits
will be plentiful and competition for
the premiums will be keen.
The school exhibit has always been
first-class and will this year eclipse any
previous exhibit.
The management has just mailed
three hundred Complimentary tickets
to school children who were neither
absent nor tardy during the last quart
er of the school year and it desires to
announce- that if it has missed any
child who is entitled to a compliment
ary ticket, it will be sent one by having
its teacher write to Dwight L. Wilson,
Secretary, at East Jordan, giving the
child's name.
Those who have not as yet sent In a
list of their exhibits should do so be
fore the opening of the Fair.
WILSON FLEXIBILITY.
We do cot see why there should
have been any stir In the senate orei
the discovery that President Wilson
has completely reversed himself to
the matter of the proposed child latooi
law. Senator Borah was able to show
that Mr. Wilson described this legis
lation In his "Constitutional Govern
ment" as unconstitutional, an "(fori
ouily absurd extravagance," carrying
the congressslonal power to rsgulats
commerce beyond, the "utmost boun
daries of reasonable and honest In
ference," and tasking It possible, 1!
sustained, for congress to -legislate
over "every particular of the Indus
trial organization and action of the
country." That, we must confess, has
also been the Evening Post's view.
But the Evening Post and Senator
Borah are old fogies, dating back to
the time when It was the custom to
have fixed beliefs and principles and
stick to them. The senator has evi
dently not read ACr. Wilson's letter lo
explaining his change of front on the
tariff commission that It Is only a
narrow man, whose mind Is stupidly
closed to new Ideas, who does not
alter his opinions. Dy this test, Mr.
Wilson Is obviously one of the broad
est minded men this country has ever
produced, for he has changed his
mind, to date, on the Initiative, refer
endum, recall, woman suffrage, the
tariff commission, tariff for revenue
only, a permanent diplomatic service
beyond politics, the merit system in
the civil service, the proper place of
Tammany Hall fh the scheme of the
universe, child labor legislation, pre
paredness, Bryan, a continental army
but why continue? It Is 'a long
enough list to prove that Mr. Wilson's
political views are not fossilized by
any fear of ln'?onslstency. New York
Evening Post.
THE AMERICAN WORKING
MAN 8HALL NOT SUFFER
The Republican Party stands
for the principle of protection
We must apply that principle
fairly, without abuses, In as sci
entific a manner as possible;
and Congress should be aided
by e Investigations of an ex
pert body. We stand for the
safe-guarding of our economic
Independence, for the develop
ment of American Industry, for
the maintenance of American
standards of living. We propose
that In the competitive struggle
that Is about to come the Amer
lean working-man shall not suf

PROPOSED APPLE
LEGISLATION
East Lansing, Mich., Aug. 21. The
Michigan State Horticultural Society at
its recently held mid-summer meeting
at Traverse City passed a resolution
urging that steps be taken to secure
from the next legislature an apple
grading law similar to the one now in
force in New York State. It was also
decided that a committee be appointed
to prepare a draft which might become
the basis of such a law as is desired by
the fruit growers. This committee is
to present its draft at the annual meet
ing of the StataSociety at Grand Rapids
the first week in December. The New
York law which is being used by a
number of the states as a starting
point in their efforts to get the apple
industry on a sound commercial basis
provides for four grades of fruit, name
ly, Standard Fancy, Standard A, Stan
dard B, and Unclassifed. The Standard
A grade which would include the lar
ger part of the marketed fruit "con
sists of apples of one variety which are
well grown specimens, hand-picked,
properly packed, normal shape, practi
cally free from dirt, diseases, insect
and fungus injury, bruises and other
defects except such as are necessarily
caused in the operation of packing; or
apples of one variety which are not
more than ten per centum below the
foregoing specifications oa a combina
tion of all defects or five per centum
on any single defect. No apples in
this grade shall show less than thirty
three and one-third per centum of good
color for the variety."
I School Commissioner's
Notes
L
May L. Stewart, Commissioner
Greetings to all! - This has been a
busy summer in spite of the heat but
the commissioner had two weeks on
the much advertised Peninsula of
Grand Traverse county. The Peninsula
Driveway contains four Standard
schools in succession. This fact alone
bespeaks the prosperity of the town
ship. A number of our schools have been
employing the improvement germ dur
ing the summer and many good
measures were carried at the annual
meetings but the commissioner has not
yet received a list of them all. Every
school in Eveline township is making
valuable improvements during the
summer, two schools in Marion, one in
South Arm, two in Wilson, two in
Boyne Valley, three in Melrose, one in
Chandler, two in Hayes, and two in St.
James. Watch for details later. Is
your school district in the swim?
Uncle Obidiah has forgotten all about
his boulder. A part of it has disappear
ed altogether.
There were 14 applicants for teachers
examination August 10-12, 7 of whom
were writing on the second grade tests.
There were 8 sets of papers transferred
from other counties for inspection by
our county board of examiners.
Thursday the 17th is the last day for
the receipt of annual reports of town
ship clerks and school directors. Most
of them are already in the office and a
few have already undergone the first
correction and have been returned for
amendments. The reports have been .
carefully made out in all cases and
some of them are very nearly perfect.
The fair tickets were mailed on the
morning of the 17th to all pupils whose
names had been handed in to the com
missioner and by her to the Secretary
of the Fair D; L. Wilson, of EastJor
dan. Any boys and girls who were not
absent or tardy for the last three
months of school should have had their
teachers send in their names with
statements to that effect.
The recommended books for use in
the rural schools may be secured at
Watson's in Boyne City or at the Cen
tral Drug Store in Boyne City. All new
books should be bought from this list
These two firms will also handle the
new-Reading Circle books for the use
of teachers during the year 1916-1917.
These new Reading Circle books are
"Health Work in the Schools" and
"Stories and Storytelling."
Eighth grade book on which reading
will be based next spring is "Tubal
Cain" by Charles Mackay. Better not
read it until the spring of the year.
Two Standard School plates were
ordered last week, and will be present
ed to their respective districts very
soon and with great joy in the doing.
Two eighth grade diplomas address
ed to Edith Quinn. Charlevoix, and to
Ave Jof fe of Charlevoix, have been re-
turned to the office unclaimed. If any
one knows where these two eighth
grade graduates may be located, the
information will be very gratefully re
ceived. '
