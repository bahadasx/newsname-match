index of public aentiment against re
linquishing the islands, and meant the
United States had decided to eep the
islands for all time.
"Public opinion haa been ao clear,"

the Philippine people should decide
that the independence question haa
been eettled for all time unless the
fortunes of war should change the
American policy."
The house ia expected to approve the
conference measure within a few days
and send it to the President. It pro
vides for reorganization of the island
government so aa to materially extend
native control. A senate amendment

An additional responsibility I
brought to the hourknier la tba hut
aeaaon. wrltrs Mrs. Christine Fred
erick In the Cbicaxo Nswa. She must
pay greater attention to her food sup
plies aad the way they are kft. It ia
tn periods of high tempersture thnt sll
food, and particularly meat, milk and
fralte, are likely to spoil and dn-iiy.

the sir which feed oo our fond There
are also In th foods themselves cer
tain substances which, while Mot alive,
are the products of living thin? am!
which cease fruits to ripen, twl to
grow, etc -
Both these causes result in detector--
atloo or decay of the food unless they
are prevented. Bacteria of various
kinds and allied piaot orgnnlxtus like
mold attack and break down food tis-'
sue, causing (he food to become unfit
for use. Now, there are about 'three
waya la which the housewife can pre-
B .. . tfywwC CAn, (LltMflW.tln,!
1. By keeping the food la a low
temperature, aa with the Icebox, etc.
2. By sterillxiDg and kilting the bac
teria by means of a high temperature.
S. By the ose of certain preserva
tives, as sugar, salt, vinegar, spices, '
etc. ,.' , .. r
. The first means entails constant su
pervision of the refrlserator. Newspa
pers should not be ned on ttie shelves
or on the Ice, aa thla prevents proper
dnrulatioa of air and may cause tne
box; to become bad ameJllng and dwri,

food. ' . - . ".. '
The second point can be followed by
cooking a quantity of food which
seems to be on the point of spoiling. A
box of berries can be saved by atewiug
with sugar. Milk which undoubtedly
would not keep until the next morning
will be satisfactory if scalded. Many
other foods which might become sub
ject to mold or spoliation can be saved
by being thus cooked or sterilized and
perhaps canned temporarily.
Bait, sugar and vinegar are helpful,
natural preservatives. Their addition
to many fruits and vegetables will
make them "keep" several days longer
than If they were not used. For In
stance, beets, string beans, cucumber,,
etc, which In warm weather cannot be
allowed to stand over night unless In a
very low temperature, will be perfectly
preserved if covered with a weak solu
tion of vinegar or brine. Soup and
all twice cooked foods like stews, etc,"
are particularly likely to ferment and
should be watched carefully. All cou
tatners of food most be allowed suffi
cient air and not closed when the foods,
are still warm.
