Washington Gossip
Washington, Aug. 21. Robin
Redbreast, hero of the story
books and well known model in
the bird kingdom, has been
charged with leading a dual life.
In the North, a sober, industri
ous, home-loving father, the al
legation is that he spends his
winters in the South in rioutous
living. Even in Georgia, where
state prohibition prevails, he is
reported as having been seen
drunk in public. On coming
north, however, it is said he al
ways reforms.
Asked for an opinion in the
case of Cock Robin, Secretary
Pearson, of the National Associ
ation of Audubon Socities, re
cently in Washington, and au
thority on birds and their habits,
said he had frequently seen rob
ins in the South so intoxicated
that they could scarcely flutter
along the ground. This misde
meanor is reported to occur in
the southern states where grows
the China tree, also known as
the "Pride of India." or "Per
sian Lilac."
Robins sometimes eat the ber
ries of this tree which, having
absorbed rainwater, form an al
coholic liquid which intoxicates
birds, causing them to lose con
trol of themselves and fall to the
ground. Thus, many birds are
captured and eaten by the ne
groes of tho Sooth.
It is Baid that, during the Civil
War, soldiors gathered China
berries und distilled from them
an alcholic beverage, which be-
cam nnltcnnnnl I'h wm
bition people are said to be look
ing into the tree's alleged prop-
: erties.
, The China tree, scientists say,
is very common along the lower
gulf coast country, where it
grows very rapidly and is a pop
ular shade tree. Its abundant
lilac-colored flowers appear early
in the spring and the leaves are
retained late into autumn, fol
lowed by clusters of yellow ber
ries. Notwithstanding Robin Red
breast's occasional sprees, the
Audubon Societies give him a
good general reputation in an at
tractively illustrated little bulle
tin which they are sending out
from their New York offices to
anyone who will send them a two
cent stamp.
