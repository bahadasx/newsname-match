I KIITAIN TO HK KOKJHT
IIV I.AIIOH IN f'OMillKSS
The principal arguments against the
idea of aS'pernianent commission for
the prevention or settlement of strikes
were that it would almost certainly he
fought by labor in I'oiigr.ss, and that
while President Wilson might be en
tirely willing now to back such legis
lation, lie might not be in a position
to do so when it was proposed Rep
resentatives of the brotherhoods who
heard of this phase of the plan to-day
were plainly against it A counter
suggestion was heard among the presi
dents that strike questions should be
loft to the Interstate Commerce ?'om
mlssion with power to investigate and
make a public report of tlieir findings,
with a strike held in abeyance pending
the investigation.
The special committee's plan has been
tentatively accepted by the connnittec
of eight, and it was the subject of to
day's conference at the White House.
Its substance, was communicated to the
lnbor representatives through Judge
WHIhun 1^. Chambers, of the Hoard of
I Mediation and Conciliation.
The railroad presidents are under
stood not to be insistent upon the com
mission idea for sottlenient of future
disputes, and the main dilllcully has
I,e n the working out of operating plans
under an eight-hour day and of giving
assurances to the presidents and man
agers that they can count upon a
freight-rate increase.

Presidents and managers agree that
I he operating problem presented Is one
of the most complicated they ever have
undertaken. There seems to be an.
opinion that the eight-hour day must
lie granted, but the roads which now
arc operating on only a narrow margin
of profit, or on which the physical ditll
c.ultles are unusual, present serious
problems to be overcome. The effort
has been to Include in the oight-hour

Beards of French

I'ARIS, August 24.-?Th<> beard of the
French soldier is doomed in an army
order directing that tlio men at the
front shave all hut mustaches. The
order brought an outburst of humorous
.in<! ironical discussion in the trench
newspapers to which the most famous
French artists, philosophers and lit

General Pierre Cherfils, reasoning
I technically, excuses tiie measure bu
?-ause "the beard of a trooper weighs
on an average sixty grams. With
2.000,000 at the front, this brings the
aggregate weight to 120 tons. It was
natural that the staff should think of
relieving the army <?f this considerable
and useless weight. It was reasonable,
in creating heavy material, to make

corroborated in a telegram received at
Amsterdam from Bremen, as forwarded
by neuter's correspondent
Ac ordintr to this information, the
I Deutschland traveled 4.20a miles on her
homeward voyage At the beginning
the sea was tempestuous, but later it
became more calm. The Deutschland
proved to be able to navigate the
stormy seas excellently. Her engines
worked faultlessly. N"<> icebergs were
passed on the Journey.
The American government, say* the
dispatch, acted in a correct manner as
a neutral, rigorously enforcing respect
for its frontier from British and l;'rencl\
warships by the employment of its own
men-of-u ar.
After* a British cruiser entered
Chesapeake Bay at night, even more
effective measures were taken to en
force neutrality. No less than eight
British warships, it is said, were on the
alert, surrounded by numerous small
American vessels which had been chart
ered for the purpose of placing nets
and obtaining information as to the
movements of the 1'eutschland. Never
theless. the submarine succeeded in
leaving undetected. A distance of 100
miles was traversed under water with
out difficulty.
The I >eutsehland returned home
slightly damaged, according to an Ex

Hague, which says this information is
contained in a tclojiram from Bremen.
The members of the crcw were unwill

The quarantine is all - embracing.
Health certificates will not be received
as evidence of a child's freedom from
disease or from exposure to it. To
make the prohibition as effective as
i possible, the hoard deemed it advisa
ble not to follow the example of other

these are included nieces and nephews

Adults are not affected. I>r. Koyster,
I in his resolution, pointed out that in

enough to justify the feeling that, from
a quarantine standpoint, it is negligi

"The enforcement of this quarantine
will begin at once. I nili'V the resolu
tions. the railroad <>r other carrier and
any individual transporting any one
into Virginia is jointly liable with the
individual fcr the enforcement of the
quarantine. This will be fully covered
in the formal text of the regulations
which will be issued as soon as they
can be drawn in legal form.
'"Notice of the quarantine regulations
have been sent all health ollicers to
day, and the full text will be issued
to-niKht or early to-morrow morning.
The hoard to-day adopted new regula
tions. effective to-morrow, regarding
the intrastate control of infantile
pa ralysis.
"I want t>> emphasize the fact that
thus far Virginia has escaped such an
outbreak of infantile paralysis as has
appeared in New York We have fewer
cases than we had last year. Hut the
widening circle of infantile paralysis
renders it imperative that we take such
precautions as our knowledge of the
disease warrants I hope the public
will support us In our earnest effort to
make these preciutions effective, and I
shall use the fullest publicity in ex
plaining exactly what the situation is
and how we are working to protect the

"The. quarantine declared to-day is
aimed, at thosi persons whom experi
ence has shown to be most susceptible
to infantile paralysis and most respon
sible for its spread. As far as the
public safety rmits, no handicap has
j been put upon general traffic, and none
will be imposed unless necessary.
Virginia children who are now in
nrctip infected with infantile paralysis
will be allowed to return to the State
if they submit to two weeks' quar
antine."
Posters warning the traveling public
of New York, New Jersey and l'enn- i
sylvania against entering Virginia will
be prepared and sent, out by the depart
ment to-day t<> railway and steamship
terminals in the areas affected by the
quarantine. It is also probable that
guards will be placed within the next
few days on the northern border of the
State to turn back children from the
three infected States.
Hallway and steamship olllcials and
all common carriers will be warned
that to transport persons into Virginia

to Incur the penalties prescribed by the

DEBATE ON REVENUE BILL
Republican Senators Penrose mill Sher
man Consume Mnwt of Time In
. Semite.
WASHINGTON*. Aucust " I.?Senators
Penrose and Sherman, Republicans,
consumed most of the time in to-day's
debate on the revenue bill. The Penn
sylvania Senator concluded a speech
against the tnenjuro begun yesterday,
attacking particularly the proposed
munitions and inheritance taxes.
He also criticized the tariff commis
sion, to be created by the bill.
Senator Sherman attacked the pro
posed income tax increases as unfair
and Inequitable, and assailed the Demo
cratic. tariff.
"This present tariff law is a inon-,
grel," he said. "It is a mixture, horn
of the tariff for revenue and the com
petitive tariff, and. like a mule, has
all the unholy aspects of both ances
tors and the virtues of none."
