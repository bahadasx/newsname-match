PRESIDENT CALLS
MORE CONFERENCES
Employers and Employes Summoned
to White House—Meetings End
Without Apparent Results—Garret
son, Spokesman For Employes, Says
No Concrete Plan Has Been Pre
sented to Which Railroads Will Agree
Washington, Aug. 23.—The railway
strike negotiations resolved themselves
today, outwardly at least, into a more
or less confused state. Expressions of
optimism from both sides were not so
free as they were yesterday and feeling
Heretofore among the manager that
plan to include the eight-hour day
would be found was not so evident.
Some of the railroad executives re
verted to their former stand that it
would never be conceded.
All parties to the conferences stead
fastly refused to say what was talked
about.
The railroad executives conferred
among themselves during the day and
it was thought possible they might gc
to the White Houpe. They issued this
statement:
"The executives are understood to be
studying a form of a communication
to the president."
Some of the more optimistic had
hopes of a decision being reached be
fore tomorrow night." The executives
and managers devoted practically no
time today to consideration of freight
rate increases "or settlement of future
strikes but centered on the length of
the working day and pay.
The brotherhood headsi declared they
had not changed their attitude a
particle.
Washington, Aug. 25.—President Wil
son summoned representatives of em
ployes and employers involved in the
threatened^railroad strike to the White
House to confer on proposals for a
settlement.
Arrangements were made for repre
sentatives of the employes to see the
president at 10:20 o'clock^ and of rep
resentatives of th* employers later.
Commissioner Chambers of tho fed
jBrol mediation- board.- he'ld af'brief con
ference with the pre'srfdent early this
morning.
The four brotherhood heads said they
did not know why they had beer, caljed
by the president. It was understood the
president wanted.to get their vieys on
legislation under consideration to pre
vent such a controversy in the future.
No Change in Situation.
The four brotherhood leaders re
mained with the president an hour and
a halt. The president kept the cabinet
waiting for an hour to continue his con
ference with the railroad mep.
"The situation insofar as we are
concerned," A. B. Garretson, spokes
man for the employes, later said, "is
absolutely unchanged. No concrete
proposition to which the roads will
agree has been tendered us. Our posi
tion is exactly the same as it was when
we accepted the president's plan. We
have deviated from it in no way what
soever."
Wilson Propaganda.
The brotherhood leaders went from
the White House to report to a meet
ing of the men, but insisted they had
nothing particular to communicate.
W. G. Lee, of the trainmen, gave out
copies of an order which, he said, ha4
been sent by the Northern Pacific to*
the station agents, directing them to
get local interests to telegraph the
president to settle the differences by
other means than arbitration.
The telegrams, Mr. Lee declared,
were to be paid for by the"road, and
were evidence, Mr. Lee declared, of a
propaganda of the president's plan.
No Hope From Congress.
The railroads have stated tl.ey pre
fer the application of the Canadian
commission plan to conditions in the
United States. But with the democrats
anxious to have congress adjourn in
order that they may begin political
campaigning and the republicans
threatening to conduct a filibuster
against any railroad legislation of this
kind, it is apparent that such compre
hensive legislation cannot be hoped for
during the present session.
It also is pointed out by the railroad
officials that, while the president has in
dicated his willingness to have the in
terstate commerce commission consider
an increase in freight rates, they have
no guarantee and the president cannot
give any guarantee that the commission
will authorize the increase.
It is conceivable that congress might
Increase the membership of the, inter
state commerce commission, which
would place Mr. Wilson's appointees- in
the majority and make the body more

Prefer Board Inquiry.
The road officials say It would be pre
ferable for congress specifically to di
the commission to make an inves
tigation into the relations of the roads
and their employes and specifically con
sider the question of hours and wages.
Moreover, the road officials point out
that an investigation into the propriety
of an advance in rates would take
months, and, if the eight-hour day
should go immediately into operation
the lines would be compelled to bear
the burden Of an increase of compensa
tion amounting to from 20 to 25 per cent
without the slightest prospect of re
couping the expenditure.
The railroads also assert that they
are not as prosperous as the country
has believed.

He claimed that the eight-hour day,

"would-seriously affect the credit of the

The Bremen, according to the ac

Dover in a steel net. Two members of

The Bremen, it was said, whli*
enmeshed in the net, was sighted by

After endeavoring for a time to ex

steamed away to Dover with her pris

BERLIN REFUSES TO ANSWER.
Will Not State Punishment of Diver
Officer Who Sank Sussex.
Washington, Aug. 25.—Germany has
refused:
1. To advise the United States of
the punishment meted out to the Ger
man submarine commander who torpe
doed the channel liner Sussex last
spring.
2. To make any explanation of the
action of a submarine commander In
firing upon the American steamer
Owego.
The refusal of the Berlin government
to comply with requests of the United
States in these two specific cases,
added to Information received from
Ambassador Gerard, Is increasing the
apprehension of the authorities In re
gard to Germany's future course with
reference to submarine operations.
Consideration is being given to the
advisability of making representations,
warning Berlin as to the consequences
of a- violation of the assurances given
in response to President Wilson's ulti
matum of last May.
It may be confidently predicted,
however, that the government will
decide to pursue a policy of "watch

arises, which involves American life
or American interests, the authorities
say the president will act.

nation containing views on the peace
conditions which might be Imposed by
Gemany Is published today by "the in
dependent committee for a German
peace," an organization formed some
time ago by those considered to be the
extreme war advocates In Germany.
Tho proclamation asserts that, desplt*
the fact that the Germans and their
allies are holding "three kingdoms in
their hands, the entente statesmen
continue to Indulge In a Hood of abuse
and lies about Germany, while thorn-*
selves violating every principle of In
ternational law, forcing neutrals to en-,*
tor the war, and endeavoring to force
into submission thru hunger millions
whom their swords could not vanliuloh.
"Our enemies will not succeed," the
proclamation says. "One thing they
have accomplished is to force us to
the belief that England Is our most
dangerous enemy. England leads the
allies. On England they depend and
will depend aftor the war. On the
wreckage of our empire England hopes'
to unfurl the banner of Anglo-Saxon
dominion."
The document aaserta that Russian
territory from the Baltic to Volhynia''
must be Included in the German sphere
to serve as a bulwark against Russian
tendency to annihilate Germany.
France's revenge Ideas must con
stantly be kept In mind so that In the
west also, changes would be necessary.
