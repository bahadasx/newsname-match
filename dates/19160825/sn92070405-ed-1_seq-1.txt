A WARNING TO FED
ERAL OFFICE HOLDERS
A warning has been issued by

to PRESIDENTIAL appointees
not to use their official authority
or influence to coerce the political
action of any person or body.
The Secretary emphasizes on
the fact that no presidential ap
pointee shall use his position TO
BRING ABOUT HIS SELECTION
AS A DELEGATE TO ANY CON
VENTION, or to manipulate party
principles or conventions.
POLITICAL DOPE
Owing to the absence of the
Liberal's cartoonist this week a
correct representation for a head
ing to this discourse is absent.
However, in its place a word
cartoon is made up for the bene
fit and inspiration of the artist
when he returns. It is:
A man in a circus costume
holding out a hoop through which
he bids the trained animals to
jump. In the picture they are
jumping through the hoop nicely
and the Man is well pleased.
The animals are labeled "Lords
burg Democratic Voters' and the
man with the hoop "Mart Q.
Hardin."
Thus we have the inspiring
work of art for this week
suggeste by "Uncle Pete" Chase.
On Saturday night the "machi
nery, was well oiled. The Demo
cratic precinct primaries were a
howling success but most of the
howling was done too late. It
was slick business with all the
cards exposed to view, this pri
mary, and it happened like this:
Mart Hardin typewrote sixty
or more ballots containing the
names of seven delegates, who
were later, at the primary, nomi
nated. These were distributed
to the Democratic voters at the
K. of P. Hall and the hat passed.
Into that hat were dropped Mr.
Hardin's ballots. Joe Olney and
J. S. Brown were nominated as
MINES AND MINING
WILL SINK SHAFT AT OCTO
The Wright brothers of Bisbec,
Ariz., have been awarded a con
tract by the Octo Mining & Mill
ing company for the sinking of a
500 foot shaft at the Octo Mine at
Lee's Peak. They will begin act
ive work in about ten days and
will give employment to twenty
five or thirty men. Much new
equpiment has been ordered for
the work and all expedience will be
made in getting the shaft down to
the 500 foot level.
The Octo mine is under the man
agement of William Davis, who
purchased the property sonic years
ago, forming the Octo Mining &
Milling Company.
In 1801 the prominent silicious
outcropping four and a half miles
southwest of Lordsburg, was lo
cated by a prospector named An
plegate. This man put down a 10
loot shaft in the center of his pro
pcrty and kept up the assessment
work for six years, later disap
pearing to parts unknown. The
next owners became Joe Raby and
J. N. Wines. In 1902 the present
owners bought the property and
added several claims by location.
Three deep shafts' and several
shallow prospect holes have been
sunk by the Octo Company, all re
vealing ore in place. There are

BOYS WILL BE BOYS
Saturday afternoon, following
the primaries at the Redrock
school house several of the "big
boys" on the Gila pulled off a
pogalistic carnival which was un
announced up until two minutes
before it took place. Reports
from the front are to the effect
that it was a first class battle in
every respect. But then "boys
will be boys."
MINING PUBLICITY
The Daily mining and Finan
cial Record of this week contains
a first page feature article clipped
from the Western Liberal telling
of the planned construction of a
mill at the 85 mine and other
progress in this camp. It is pub
licity that could not be purchased.
KID LOUIS AND
OTHERS IN ACCIDENT
Lordsburg was startled last
week when word was received
here of an automobile accident
near Clifton. The Copper Era
has the following to say of tho;
occurance: !
Another automobile accident
was added to the already long list
to take place iu the vicinity of
Clifton, fortunately all tho occu
pants of the car escaping death
miraculously and surviving with
numerous bruises and broken
bones.
The accident happened shortly
after dark on Monday evening
on the Metcalf road near Long
fellow. The car was owned by
Chino Gallo of Clifton and was
being driven by Kid Louis, the
four passengers in the machine
being Morris Manheimer, and
Gerardo Zorilla of Metcalf and
Manuel Lamas and Jose Maria
Ponce of Clifton. The exact
manner in which the accident
happened is not known, but it is
I surmised that the driver lost
control ol the car and it togetner
with its load of passengers

80 feet.
