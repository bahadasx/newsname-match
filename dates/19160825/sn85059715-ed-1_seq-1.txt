WASHINGTON, Aug. 25.?Congress-1
Sutherland lias under consideration i
sonic form of action to bring the at- i
tcntlon of Congress to the mutter of
the interference on the high sens with i
the United States mail, it will prob- i

of the House all he bus bearing i
upon the subject, how long it has been ,
going on. to what extent, what notion i
of un executive nature has boon taken i
to stop it, and Information of a like
naturo.
The Interest of Mr. Sutherland in 1
thlH matter was enlisted by a protnl- 1
nentand wealthy citizen of Clarksburg ' t
whoso letter inndo a deep Impression '
upon the West Virginia representative. (
The high charnclcr of the complain- I
ant insured prompt Intorcst on the 1
pnrt of Mr. Sutherland, and directed I 1
hltn In at once start a thorough Inves- 1 1
tteatlon of fho question of interfcr
enco with tho malls by foreign countries,
especially Great Hrltaln. The
result will doubtless bo the Intro-j
ductlon by Mr. Sutherland of a resolullon
of inquiry as stated aforesaid.
The Clarksburgor's letter io Mr.
Sutherland which hns set him to work
on this matter, says In part:
"Dear Sir: FV>r a long while I have
watched with pre,K interest tho manner
In which our foreign mall problem
has been handled hy tho present administration.
What puzzles mo Is not
the fact thnt tho president has for
nearly two years permitted England to
steal our mail; that would be expected
of him from the way ho has boon favoring
them since the beginning of the
war, but the fact that the representatives
In Congress whom tho people
send to Washington to look aftor their
interests have dono nothing whatever
to put a stop to this lawlessness, Is
what I cannot understand.
"It Is generally understood mat tne
United States mall Is the most sacred
thing In this eounlry and that a man .
committing murder has a far hotter I
chance to go unpunished than tho one
who tampers with tho mall. Why
should we he so strict with our own
citizens and then permit foreigners to
rifle onr mails and at. the samo tlmo
tell us that If we don't like It we can f
lump It? I
