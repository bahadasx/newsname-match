, .
, WELDON SUBMITS CLAIMS TO
VOTERS AT NOVEMBER POLLS
Three-Cornered Fight Appears
Certain In Twentyfourth
Senatorial District
With William E. Weldon ap
pealing to the voters of Carroll
and Henry counties for ' support
in the November election and
the nominetian of either T. V.
Burton or Jo H. McCall by the
convention of r September 9th
forecasted, Republicans are be
ginning to cast their eyes toward
the State Senatorship, and it be
gins to look as if a three-cornered
fight may result in Novem
ber. So far Messrs. Burton and
McCall are the only candidates
' who have signified their inten
Hicra of going before the
McKenzie convention, and Mr.
Weldon has . stated positively
that be will not enter the con
vention, but will carry his case
to the voters in the November
election.
Republicans believe that with
Mr. Weldon and the nominee of
the McKenzie convention in the
fight that they would have a
good chance to put their candi
date across at the polls, although
Democrats, as a rule, do not
share this view. The Democrats
seem to be of the opinion that a
v Republican would get only a
scattering vote and that the bulk
pt the G. O. P. support would go
, to one of the other candidates.
Among those spoken of as
possible Republican candidates
are D. M. Nobles, of Paris, and
J. Sam Johnson, of Huntingdon,
although it is not known wheth
er either would consent to make
the race. ,
-Regardless of how' the situa
tion may shape up, it now seems
certain that the people of Henry
and Carroll counties will see some
warm politics this fall, and it is
impossible at present to forecast
the result.
MRS. RICHARD BURTON
Mrs. Richard Burton, age
years, 9 months, passed away on
Saturday in the old Twentieth

Kirk 's DrugStore
Increases Space
To Meet Demand
Because of the increased busi
ness and inadequate floor space
of the old building alone, Kirk's
Drug Store, uptown, has now
occupied the building on the east
corner of the Caldwell block.
This more than doubles the floor
space and it will be possible to
carry a much larger stock.
I. F. Kirk, ,the proprietor, be
gan a small business here sever
al years ago and has been suc
cessful from the first. His busi
ness has grown by leaps and
bounds and a few years ago he
opened a store in West Paris.
With the'extension of his store
No, 1, Mr. Kirk's uptown store
becomes one of the most up-to-date
in West Tennessee.
The wall between the old
building and the one just occu
pied by Kirk's Drug Store has
been removed, making the two
buildings into one. For many
weeks workmen have been busy
remodeling the building and it is
now one of the most attractive
stores to be found anywhere.
Mr. Kirk is one of the most
progressive business men in the
city, and his many friends are
glad to see him enlarge his busi
ness, feeling that he deserves the
success that has come to him.

STATE BACTERIOLOGIST IN
REPORT TO OFFICIALS HERE
Sample of City Water Sent To
Nashville For Testing
Two Weeks Ago
"This water, is alright for
drinking purposes," states the
report of Dr. William Litterer,
state bacteriologist, in a report
on the city water of Paris, which
he furnished the Citv Water and
Light plant this week.
The sample of water was sent
to Nashville on August 7, and
Dr. Litterer's report states that
one cubic centimeter of the wa
ter at room temperature shows a
bacterial count of 80 and at incu
bator temperature a count of 60.
No acid colonies nor coli were
found, according to the report
which was received by the au
thorities of the local water and
light plant on Wednesday.
It isaaid that the city proposes
to install machinery which will
remove the coloring from the
water.
Considerable speculation as to
the cause of so much typhoid fe
ver in Paris has heen going on
and many seemed to think that
the city water was partly respon
sible. However, the report seems
to clear this matter up as it
states that the water is "alright
for drinking purposes"."
